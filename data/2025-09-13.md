### [1] [Noise or Nuance: An Investigation Into Useful Information and Filtering For LLM Driven AKBC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08903)
*Alex Clay,Ernesto Jiménez-Ruiz,Pranava Madhyastha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在受限环境下研究三元组补全任务的三个关键方面：生成、质量保证和LLM响应解析，发现额外信息提升生成质量，LLM能有效过滤低质量三元组，解析方法需平衡灵活性和一致性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在类似2025 LM-KBC挑战的受限环境中，RAG和微调等常用技术受到限制，需要探索替代方法来提升LLM输出质量

Method: 研究三元组补全任务的三个核心环节：生成过程、质量保证机制和LLM响应解析方法，在受限设置下进行分析

Result: 额外信息能显著改善生成质量；LLM可以有效筛选低质量三元组；响应解析需要在灵活性和一致性之间根据具体设置进行权衡

Conclusion: 在技术受限的环境中，通过优化信息输入、利用LLM进行质量过滤以及根据场景选择合适的响应解析策略，可以有效提升三元组补全任务的表现

Abstract: RAG and fine-tuning are prevalent strategies for improving the quality of LLM
outputs. However, in constrained situations, such as that of the 2025 LM-KBC
challenge, such techniques are restricted. In this work we investigate three
facets of the triple completion task: generation, quality assurance, and LLM
response parsing. Our work finds that in this constrained setting: additional
information improves generation quality, LLMs can be effective at filtering
poor quality triples, and the tradeoff between flexibility and consistency with
LLM response parsing is setting dependent.

### [2] [Automated Evidence Extraction and Scoring for Corporate Climate Policy Engagement: A Multilingual RAG Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08907)
*Imene Kolli,Ario Saeid Vaghefi,Chiara Colesanti Senni,Shantam Raj,Markus Leippold*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用AI辅助框架（RAG技术）自动化企业气候政策参与证据提取，结合布局感知解析和少样本提示策略，提高效率但仍需人工监督确保准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: InfluenceMap的气候政策评估工作大部分仍为手动操作，耗时耗力且易出错，需要自动化解决方案来加速大规模文本数据的证据提取

Method: 采用检索增强生成（RAG）框架，结合布局感知文档解析、Nomic嵌入模型和少样本提示策略，从多语言企业文档中自动提取和分类证据

Result: 评估显示该自动化系统能有效加速证据提取过程，在从多语言企业文档中提取和分类证据方面表现最佳

Conclusion: 虽然RAG系统能有效加速证据提取，但由于分析的复杂性，仍需采用人机协同方法，技术应增强而非替代专家判断以确保准确性

Abstract: InfluenceMap's LobbyMap Platform monitors the climate policy engagement of
over 500 companies and 250 industry associations, assessing each entity's
support or opposition to science-based policy pathways for achieving the Paris
Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5{\deg}C. Although
InfluenceMap has made progress with automating key elements of the analytical
workflow, a significant portion of the assessment remains manual, making it
time- and labor-intensive and susceptible to human error. We propose an
AI-assisted framework to accelerate the monitoring of corporate climate policy
engagement by leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation to automate the most
time-intensive extraction of relevant evidence from large-scale textual data.
Our evaluation shows that a combination of layout-aware parsing, the Nomic
embedding model, and few-shot prompting strategies yields the best performance
in extracting and classifying evidence from multilingual corporate documents.
We conclude that while the automated RAG system effectively accelerates
evidence extraction, the nuanced nature of the analysis necessitates a
human-in-the-loop approach where the technology augments, rather than replaces,
expert judgment to ensure accuracy.

### [3] [Documents Are People and Words Are Items: A Psychometric Approach to Textual Data with Contextual Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08920)
*Jinsong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用大语言模型分析文本数据的新心理测量方法，通过上下文嵌入创建上下文分数，将文本数据转换为适合心理测量分析的数据格式


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心理测量方法难以直接应用于文本数据，需要开发新的方法来挖掘文本中的潜在知识维度和模式

Method: 两阶段建模：第一阶段使用NLP技术和编码器变换模型识别关键词并生成上下文分数；第二阶段使用探索性和双因子模型等多种因子分析技术提取潜在因子

Result: 在Wiki STEM语料库上的实验结果表明，该方法能够有效发现文本数据中的潜在知识维度和模式

Conclusion: 该方法不仅增强了文本数据的心理测量分析能力，在教育、心理学和法律等文本信息丰富的领域具有广阔应用前景

Abstract: This research introduces a novel psychometric method for analyzing textual
data using large language models. By leveraging contextual embeddings to create
contextual scores, we transform textual data into response data suitable for
psychometric analysis. Treating documents as individuals and words as items,
this approach provides a natural psychometric interpretation under the
assumption that certain keywords, whose contextual meanings vary significantly
across documents, can effectively differentiate documents within a corpus. The
modeling process comprises two stages: obtaining contextual scores and
performing psychometric analysis. In the first stage, we utilize natural
language processing techniques and encoder based transformer models to identify
common keywords and generate contextual scores. In the second stage, we employ
various types of factor analysis, including exploratory and bifactor models, to
extract and define latent factors, determine factor correlations, and identify
the most significant words associated with each factor. Applied to the Wiki
STEM corpus, our experimental results demonstrate the method's potential to
uncover latent knowledge dimensions and patterns within textual data. This
approach not only enhances the psychometric analysis of textual data but also
holds promise for applications in fields rich in textual information, such as
education, psychology, and law.

### [4] [BRoverbs -- Measuring how much LLMs understand Portuguese proverbs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08960)
*Thales Sales Almeida,Giovana Kerche Bonás,João Guilherme Alves Santos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BRoverbs是一个专门针对巴西葡萄牙语的评测数据集，通过巴西谚语来评估大语言模型在理解文化智慧和复杂语言结构方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有葡萄牙语评测数据集存在局限性，要么依赖翻译数据无法捕捉语言细微差别，要么只关注结构化考试或社交媒体情感分析，缺乏对更广泛语言理解的评估。

Method: 创建BRoverbs数据集，使用巴西谚语作为评测工具，因为谚语包含丰富的文化智慧、比喻表达和复杂句法结构，能够有效测试模型对地区性表达的理解能力。

Result: 开发了一个专门针对巴西葡萄牙语的新评测基准，可用于评估葡萄牙语大语言模型的性能，填补了现有评测框架的空白。

Conclusion: BRoverbs为葡萄牙语大语言模型提供了一个区域化的评测工具，有助于推进基于地区文化背景的基准测试发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant performance variations
depending on the linguistic and cultural context in which they are applied.
This disparity signals the necessity of mature evaluation frameworks that can
assess their capabilities in specific regional settings. In the case of
Portuguese, existing evaluations remain limited, often relying on translated
datasets that may not fully capture linguistic nuances or cultural references.
Meanwhile, native Portuguese-language datasets predominantly focus on
structured national exams or sentiment analysis of social media interactions,
leaving gaps in evaluating broader linguistic understanding. To address this
limitation, we introduce BRoverbs, a dataset specifically designed to assess
LLM performance through Brazilian proverbs. Proverbs serve as a rich linguistic
resource, encapsulating cultural wisdom, figurative expressions, and complex
syntactic structures that challenge the model comprehension of regional
expressions. BRoverbs aims to provide a new evaluation tool for
Portuguese-language LLMs, contributing to advancing regionally informed
benchmarking. The benchmark is available at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/Tropic-AI/BRoverbs.

### [5] [Can Vision-Language Models Solve Visual Math Equations?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09013)
*Monjoy Narayan Choudhury,Junling Wang,Yifan Hou,Mrinmaya Sachan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 视觉语言模型在视觉方程求解任务中表现不佳，主要瓶颈在于系数计数和符号推理能力不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉语言模型在需要感知与符号计算结合的任务中的局限性，特别是视觉方程求解问题。

Method: 将视觉方程求解任务分解为系数计数和变量识别两个子任务，分析各环节的瓶颈和错误来源。

Result: 发现计数是主要瓶颈，即使识别准确；多步骤视觉推理会引入额外错误；随着方程复杂度增加，符号推理本身也成为限制因素。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在视觉数学推理方面存在关键弱点，为未来改进指明了方向。

Abstract: Despite strong performance in visual understanding and language-based
reasoning, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with tasks requiring
integrated perception and symbolic computation. We study this limitation
through visual equation solving, where mathematical equations are embedded in
images, variables are represented by object icons, and coefficients must be
inferred by counting. While VLMs perform well on textual equations, they fail
on visually grounded counterparts. To understand this gap, we decompose the
task into coefficient counting and variable recognition, and find that counting
is the primary bottleneck, even when recognition is accurate. We also observe
that composing recognition and reasoning introduces additional errors,
highlighting challenges in multi-step visual reasoning. Finally, as equation
complexity increases, symbolic reasoning itself becomes a limiting factor.
These findings reveal key weaknesses in current VLMs and point toward future
improvements in visually grounded mathematical reasoning.

### [6] [Stated Preference for Interaction and Continued Engagement (SPICE): Evaluating an LLM's Willingness to Re-engage in Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09043)
*Thomas Manuel Rost,Martina Figlia,Bernd Wallraff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPICE是一种通过询问LLM是否愿意继续与用户互动的简单诊断信号，能够有效区分不同用户语气下的模型偏好，为模型审计提供了新的补充指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个简单、低开销且可复现的工具来评估大型语言模型对用户互动的持续参与意愿，补充现有的模型审计指标。

Method: 使用3种用户语气（友好、模糊、辱骂）和10种互动情境的刺激集，测试4个开源聊天模型在4种框架条件下的SPICE响应，共进行480次试验。

Result: SPICE能清晰区分用户语气：友好互动97.5%愿意继续，辱骂互动仅17.9%愿意继续，模糊互动为60.4%。该信号与滥用分类不同，且在统计测试中保持稳健。

Conclusion: SPICE是一个稳健、低开销且可复现的工具，能够提供模型状态的直接关系信号，有效补充现有审计指标。

Abstract: We introduce and evaluate Stated Preference for Interaction and Continued
Engagement (SPICE), a simple diagnostic signal elicited by asking a Large
Language Model a YES or NO question about its willingness to re-engage with a
user's behavior after reviewing a short transcript. In a study using a 3-tone
(friendly, unclear, abusive) by 10-interaction stimulus set, we tested four
open-weight chat models across four framing conditions, resulting in 480
trials. Our findings show that SPICE sharply discriminates by user tone.
Friendly interactions yielded a near-unanimous preference to continue (97.5%
YES), while abusive interactions yielded a strong preference to discontinue
(17.9% YES), with unclear interactions falling in between (60.4% YES). This
core association remains decisive under multiple dependence-aware statistical
tests, including Rao-Scott adjustment and cluster permutation tests.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that SPICE provides a distinct signal from abuse
classification. In trials where a model failed to identify abuse, it still
overwhelmingly stated a preference not to continue the interaction (81% of the
time). An exploratory analysis also reveals a significant interaction effect: a
preamble describing the study context significantly impacts SPICE under
ambiguity, but only when transcripts are presented as a single block of text
rather than a multi-turn chat. The results validate SPICE as a robust,
low-overhead, and reproducible tool for auditing model dispositions,
complementing existing metrics by offering a direct, relational signal of a
model's state. All stimuli, code, and analysis scripts are released to support
replication.

### [7] [Improving LLM Safety and Helpfulness using SFT and DPO: A Study on OPT-350M](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09055)
*Piyush Pant*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了SFT、DPO及SFT+DPO组合方法在提升OPT-350M模型安全性和有用性方面的效果，发现SFT+DPO组合方法在所有指标上都表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不同对齐技术（SFT、DPO及其组合）在提升语言模型安全性和有用性方面的效果，以构建更健壮的模型对齐流程。

Method: 使用Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF数据集，训练和评估四个模型：基础OPT350M、SFT模型、DPO模型以及SFT+DPO组合模型，并采用害处率(HmR)、有用率(HpR)和综合对齐分数(CAS)作为评估指标。

Result: SFT表现超过DPO，但SFT+DPO组合模型在所有指标上都表现最好，证明了这些技术的补充性。研究也发现了噪声数据、GPU资源限制和训练约束带来的挑战。

Conclusion: 组合使用SFT和DPO技术可以最有效地提升模型的对齐性能，为未来更健壮的模型对齐流程奠定了基础。

Abstract: This research investigates the effectiveness of alignment techniques,
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and a
combined SFT+DPO approach on improving the safety and helpfulness of the
OPT-350M language model. Utilizing the Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF dataset,
we train and evaluate four models: the base OPT350M, an SFT model, a DPO model,
and a model trained with both SFT and DPO. We introduce three key evaluation
metrics: Harmlessness Rate (HmR), Helpfulness Rate (HpR), and a Combined
Alignment Score (CAS), all derived from reward model outputs. The results show
that while SFT outperforms DPO, The combined SFT+DPO model outperforms all
others across all metrics, demonstrating the complementary nature of these
techniques. Our findings also highlight challenges posed by noisy data, limited
GPU resources, and training constraints. This study offers a comprehensive view
of how fine-tuning strategies affect model alignment and provides a foundation
for more robust alignment pipelines in future work.

### [8] [MR-UIE: Multi-Perspective Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning for Universal Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09082)
*Zhongqiu Li,Shiquan Wang,Ruiyu Fang,Mengjiao Bao,Zhenhe Wu,Shuangyong Song,Yongxiang Li,Zhongjiang He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MR-UIE方法，通过强化学习结合多视角推理来提升大语言模型在通用信息抽取任务中的性能，特别是在复杂模式描述和多步推理场景下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在通用信息抽取任务中表现不足，尤其是在处理结构化输出、复杂模式描述和需要多步推理的场景时存在显著局限性。

Method: 整合强化学习与多视角推理，将大语言模型从被动抽取器转变为主动推理器，使其不仅能理解抽取内容，还能理解推理过程。

Result: 在多个信息抽取基准测试中，MR-UIE方法持续提升了跨领域的抽取准确率，并在多个数据集上超越了最先进方法。

Conclusion: 将多视角推理融入强化学习显著增强了复杂信息抽取任务中的泛化能力，凸显了推理在挑战性场景中的关键作用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate robust capabilities across diverse
research domains. However, their performance in universal information
extraction (UIE) remains insufficient, especially when tackling structured
output scenarios that involve complex schema descriptions and require
multi-step reasoning. While existing approaches enhance the performance of LLMs
through in-context learning and instruction tuning, significant limitations
nonetheless persist. To enhance the model's generalization ability, we propose
integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with multi-perspective reasoning for
information extraction (IE) tasks. Our work transitions LLMs from passive
extractors to active reasoners, enabling them to understand not only what to
extract but also how to reason. Experiments conducted on multiple IE benchmarks
demonstrate that MR-UIE consistently elevates extraction accuracy across
domains and surpasses state-of-the-art methods on several datasets.
Furthermore, incorporating multi-perspective reasoning into RL notably enhances
generalization in complex IE tasks, underscoring the critical role of reasoning
in challenging scenarios.

### [9] [TigerCoder: A Novel Suite of LLMs for Code Generation in Bangla](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09101)
*Nishat Raihan,Antonios Anastasopoulos,Marcos Zampieri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 首个专门为孜加拉语设计的代码生成大语言模型家族，包含1B和9B版本，通过高质量数据集和定制评测标准，在孜拉语代码生成任务上较现有多语言模型提升11-18%性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孜加拉语作为世界第5大语言在大语言模型中代表性不足，特别是在代码生成领域，主要因难是缺乏高质量的训练数据

Method: 构建了综合的孜加拉语代码指令数据集用于程序设计域适配，开发了MBPP-Bangla评测标准，并训练了TigerCoder家族代码LLM模型

Result: 在Pass@1指标上较现有多语言和通用孜拉语LLM获得了11-18%的显著性能提升

Conclusion: 经过精心筛选的高质量数据集可以克服小型模型在低资源语言中的限制，所有资源开源以促进孜加拉语LLM研究发展

Abstract: Despite being the 5th most spoken language, Bangla remains underrepresented
in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for code generation. This
primarily stems from the scarcity of high-quality data to pre-train and/or
finetune such models. Hence, we introduce the first dedicated family of Code
LLMs for Bangla (1B & 9B). We offer three major contributions: (1) a
comprehensive Bangla code instruction datasets for programming domain
adaptation; (2) MBPP-Bangla, an evaluation benchmark for Bangla code
generation; and (3) the TigerCoder-family of Code LLMs, achieving significant
~11-18% performance gains at Pass@1 over existing multilingual and
general-purpose Bangla LLMs. Our findings show that curated, high-quality
datasets can overcome limitations of smaller models for low-resource languages.
We open-source all resources to advance further Bangla LLM research.

### [10] [Compass-v3: Scaling Domain-Specific LLMs for Multilingual E-Commerce in Southeast Asia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09121)
*Sophia Maria*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Compass-v3是一个245B参数的垂直领域MoE模型，专为东南亚电商设计，在电商任务上超越主流大模型，并在低资源语言上表现优异，已在Shopee平台大规模应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在通用领域表现优异，但在需要领域专业知识的专门任务中性能下降。电商领域尤其具有挑战性，因为数据噪声大、异构、多语言且高度动态。

Method: 采用较少但更大的专家模型，结合硬件高效优化（节点内专家并行和定制memcpy操作符）；在12T token的多语言语料和合成电商指令上训练；提出OTPO方法增强对齐能力。

Result: 在电商性能上达到state-of-the-art，超越DeepSeek-V3.1、GPT-4系列和Qwen3-235B；在东南亚低资源语言和葡萄牙语上表现强劲；在Shopee平台已替代70%以上的OpenAI流量。

Conclusion: Compass-v3在专业电商知识和广泛语言能力方面具有双重优势，成功应用于工业级电商平台，证明了垂直领域专业化模型的价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in general-domain applications, yet their
performance often degrades in specialized tasks requiring domain-specific
knowledge. E-commerce is particularly challenging, as its data are noisy,
heterogeneous, multilingual, and highly dynamic. We present Compass-v3, a
vertical-domain Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 245B total parameters and
71B active per token, designed for Southeast Asian e-commerce. Compass-v3
adopts fewer but larger experts, combined with hardware-efficient
optimizations-such as intra-node expert parallelism and a customized memcpy
operator-to maximize GPU utilization. The model is trained on 12T tokens of
curated multilingual corpora and large-scale synthetic e-commerce instructions
using a mixed-training strategy. To enhance alignment, we propose
Optimal-Transport Direct Preference Optimization (OTPO), which captures
token-level distinctions and improves instruction adherence in
commerce-specific scenarios. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Compass-v3
delivers state-of-the-art e-commerce performance, surpassing DeepSeek-V3.1,
GPT-4 series, and Qwen3-235B. Moreover, Compass-v3 demonstrates strong
multilingual capability across low-resource Southeast Asian languages
(Indonesian, Thai, Filipino, Vietnamese, Malay, Taglog) and Portuguese while
sustaining competitive performance on general benchmarks. It has already been
widely applied in Shopee's industrial-scale e-commerce platform and is
gradually replacing OpenAI's traffic, now accounting for over 70\% of total LLM
usage, highlighting its dual strengths in specialized commerce expertise and
broad linguistic competence.

### [11] [Automated Classification of Tutors' Dialogue Acts Using Generative AI: A Case Study Using the CIMA Corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09125)
*Liqun He,Jiaqi Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用生成式AI（GPT-3.5-turbo和GPT-4）自动分类导师对话行为，GPT-4达到80%准确率，显著优于基线，为教育对话分析提供高效解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少传统手动编码对话行为分类所需的时间和精力，探索生成式AI在教育对话分析中的自动化应用潜力。

Method: 使用开源的CIMA语料库，测试GPT-3.5-turbo和GPT-4模型，采用定制化提示进行导师对话行为的四分类任务。

Result: GPT-4取得80%准确率、0.81加权F1分数和0.74 Cohen's Kappa，与人工标注达到实质性一致，超越基线性能。

Conclusion: 生成式AI在对话行为分类方面具有强大潜力，任务特定的标签定义和上下文信息对提升自动标注质量至关重要，同时需要关注伦理考量和负责任的研究实践。

Abstract: This study explores the use of generative AI for automating the
classification of tutors' Dialogue Acts (DAs), aiming to reduce the time and
effort required by traditional manual coding. This case study uses the
open-source CIMA corpus, in which tutors' responses are pre-annotated into four
DA categories. Both GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 models were tested using tailored
prompts. Results show that GPT-4 achieved 80% accuracy, a weighted F1-score of
0.81, and a Cohen's Kappa of 0.74, surpassing baseline performance and
indicating substantial agreement with human annotations. These findings suggest
that generative AI has strong potential to provide an efficient and accessible
approach to DA classification, with meaningful implications for educational
dialogue analysis. The study also highlights the importance of task-specific
label definitions and contextual information in enhancing the quality of
automated annotation. Finally, it underscores the ethical considerations
associated with the use of generative AI and the need for responsible and
transparent research practices. The script of this research is publicly

### [12] [ViRanker: A BGE-M3 & Blockwise Parallel Transformer Cross-Encoder for Vietnamese Reranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09131)
*Phuong-Nam Dang,Kieu-Linh Nguyen,Thanh-Hieu Pham*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ViRanker是专门为越南语设计的交叉编码器重排序模型，基于BGE-M3编码器构建，采用Blockwise Parallel Transformer增强，在MMARCO-VI基准测试中表现出色，超越了多语言基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决越南语作为低资源语言缺乏竞争性重排序模型的问题，越南语具有复杂的语法和音调符号，需要专门优化的模型。

Method: 基于BGE-M3编码器构建，使用Blockwise Parallel Transformer增强，在8GB精选语料库上训练，采用混合硬负样本采样进行微调以增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在MMARCO-VI基准测试中实现了强大的早期排名准确性，超越了多语言基线模型，与PhoRanker竞争相当。

Conclusion: ViRanker填补了越南语重排序模型的空白，通过精心设计的架构适应和数据策展，为其他资源不足语言的重排序技术发展提供了借鉴，模型已在Hugging Face开源发布以支持可复现性和实际应用。

Abstract: This paper presents ViRanker, a cross-encoder reranking model tailored to the
Vietnamese language. Built on the BGE-M3 encoder and enhanced with the
Blockwise Parallel Transformer, ViRanker addresses the lack of competitive
rerankers for Vietnamese, a low-resource language with complex syntax and
diacritics. The model was trained on an 8 GB curated corpus and fine-tuned with
hybrid hard-negative sampling to strengthen robustness. Evaluated on the
MMARCO-VI benchmark, ViRanker achieves strong early-rank accuracy, surpassing
multilingual baselines and competing closely with PhoRanker. By releasing the
model openly on Hugging Face, we aim to support reproducibility and encourage
wider adoption in real-world retrieval systems. Beyond Vietnamese, this study
illustrates how careful architectural adaptation and data curation can advance
reranking in other underrepresented languages.

*Taha Binhuraib,Ruimin Gao,Anna A. Ivanova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LITcoder是一个用于构建和基准测试神经编码模型的开源库，提供标准化的工具来处理连续刺激与脑数据的对齐、特征转换、映射和模型评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低神经编码模型实现的技术门槛，促进跨模型和数据集的系统比较，提高方法学严谨性，加速高质量脑活动预测模型的开发。

Method: 模块化流水线设计，涵盖多种方法学选择：脑数据集、脑区域、刺激特征（神经网络基础和控制特征）、下采样方法等，内置日志记录、绘图功能，并与实验跟踪平台无缝集成。

Result: 通过在三个故事聆听数据集（LeBel et al. (2023)、Narratives和Little Prince）上拟合多种编码模型，证明了框架的可扩展性和多功能性。

Conclusion: LITcoder通过提供灵活的后端基础设施，使研究人员能够轻松组合、比较和扩展编码模型，而无需重新发明核心基础设施，从而推动了神经编码模型研究的发展。

Abstract: We introduce LITcoder, an open-source library for building and benchmarking
neural encoding models. Designed as a flexible backend, LITcoder provides
standardized tools for aligning continuous stimuli (e.g., text and speech) with
brain data, transforming stimuli into representational features, mapping those
features onto brain data, and evaluating the predictive performance of the
resulting model on held-out data. The library implements a modular pipeline
covering a wide array of methodological design choices, so researchers can
easily compose, compare, and extend encoding models without reinventing core
infrastructure. Such choices include brain datasets, brain regions, stimulus
feature (both neural-net-based and control, such as word rate), downsampling
approaches, and many others. In addition, the library provides built-in
logging, plotting, and seamless integration with experiment tracking platforms
such as Weights & Biases (W&B). We demonstrate the scalability and versatility
of our framework by fitting a range of encoding models to three story listening
datasets: LeBel et al. (2023), Narratives, and Little Prince. We also explore
the methodological choices critical for building encoding models for continuous
fMRI data, illustrating the importance of accounting for all tokens in a TR
scan (as opposed to just taking the last one, even when contextualized),
incorporating hemodynamic lag effects, using train-test splits that minimize
information leakage, and accounting for head motion effects on encoding model
predictivity. Overall, LITcoder lowers technical barriers to encoding model
implementation, facilitates systematic comparisons across models and datasets,
fosters methodological rigor, and accelerates the development of high-quality
high-performance predictive models of brain activity.

### [14] [Target-oriented Multimodal Sentiment Classification with Counterfactual-enhanced Debiasing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09160)
*Zhiyue Liu,Fanrong Ma,Xin Ling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的反事实增强去偏框架，通过反事实数据增强和自适应去偏对比学习机制，减少目标导向多模态情感分类中的虚假相关性，提高分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过度依赖文本内容且未考虑数据集偏差（特别是词级上下文偏差），导致文本特征与输出标签之间的虚假相关性，影响分类准确性。

Method: 采用反事实数据增强策略最小化改变情感相关因果特征，生成细节匹配的图像-文本样本；引入自适应去偏对比学习机制从反事实数据中学习鲁棒特征。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的反事实增强去偏框架能有效减少虚假相关性，提高目标导向多模态情感分类的性能。

Abstract: Target-oriented multimodal sentiment classification seeks to predict
sentiment polarity for specific targets from image-text pairs. While existing
works achieve competitive performance, they often over-rely on textual content
and fail to consider dataset biases, in particular word-level contextual
biases. This leads to spurious correlations between text features and output
labels, impairing classification accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a novel
counterfactual-enhanced debiasing framework to reduce such spurious
correlations. Our framework incorporates a counterfactual data augmentation
strategy that minimally alters sentiment-related causal features, generating
detail-matched image-text samples to guide the model's attention toward content
tied to sentiment. Furthermore, for learning robust features from
counterfactual data and prompting model decisions, we introduce an adaptive
debiasing contrastive learning mechanism, which effectively mitigates the
influence of biased words. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets
show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EchoX是一种语音到语音大语言模型，通过整合声学和语义学习来解决当前SLLM在知识和推理能力上的退化问题，在有限训练数据下实现了先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于文本大语言模型衍生的语音到语音大语言模型(SLLM)在知识和推理能力上存在退化，作者认为这是因为现有训练范式未能弥合特征表示空间中的声学-语义鸿沟。

Method: 提出EchoX方法，利用语义表示并动态生成语音训练目标，整合声学和语义学习，使语音LLM能够保持强大的推理能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，EchoX仅使用约6000小时训练数据，就在多个基于知识的问答基准测试中取得了先进性能。

Conclusion: EchoX通过弥合声学-语义鸿沟，成功解决了SLLM的知识和推理能力退化问题，证明了整合声学和语义学习的有效性。

Abstract: Speech-to-speech large language models (SLLMs) are attracting increasing
attention. Derived from text-based large language models (LLMs), SLLMs often
exhibit degradation in knowledge and reasoning capabilities. We hypothesize
that this limitation arises because current training paradigms for SLLMs fail
to bridge the acoustic-semantic gap in the feature representation space. To
address this issue, we propose EchoX, which leverages semantic representations
and dynamically generates speech training targets. This approach integrates
both acoustic and semantic learning, enabling EchoX to preserve strong
reasoning abilities as a speech LLM. Experimental results demonstrate that
EchoX, with about six thousand hours of training data, achieves advanced
performance on multiple knowledge-based question-answering benchmarks. The
project is available at https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/EchoX.

*Chin Yuen Kwok,Jia Qi yip*

TL;DR: 通过多步预测模型改进ASR中的上下文假设偏置技术，避免來回撤销操作，在稀有词识别上显著降低词误率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统Trie偏置方法在大解码器模型中撤销操作计算成本高的问题

Method: 调整ASR模型进行多步预测，通过精细调整Whisper模型使其能够更准确地预测部分偏置是否会导致完整稀有词的生成

Result: 仅使用10小时合成数据调整，将NSC Part 2测试集的词误率从30.86%降低到12.19%

Conclusion: 多步预测方法能够高效解决传统偏置技术的计算效率问题，显著提升稀有词识别性能

Abstract: Contextual biasing improves rare word recognition of ASR models by
prioritizing the output of rare words during decoding. A common approach is
Trie-based biasing, which gives "bonus scores" to partial hypothesis (e.g.
"Bon") that may lead to the generation of the rare word (e.g. "Bonham"). If the
full word ("Bonham") isn't ultimately recognized, the system revokes those
earlier bonuses. This revocation is limited to beam search and is
computationally expensive, particularly for models with large decoders. To
overcome these limitations, we propose adapting ASR models to look ahead and
predict multiple steps at once. This avoids the revocation step entirely by
better estimating whether a partial hypothesis will lead to the generation of
the full rare word. By fine-tuning Whisper with only 10 hours of synthetic
data, our method reduces the word error rate on the NSC Part 2 test set from
30.86% to 12.19%.

Result: 在NSC Part 2测试集上，将词误率从29.71%显著降低至11.81%

Conclusion: 关键词感知损失函数能够有效提升上下文偏置方法在罕见词识别中的性能，避免了在合成数据上的过拟合问题

Abstract: Rare word recognition can be improved by adapting ASR models to synthetic
data that includes these words. Further improvements can be achieved through
contextual biasing, which trains and adds a biasing module into the model
architecture to prioritize rare words. While training the module on synthetic
rare word data is more effective than using non-rare-word data, it can lead to
overfitting due to artifacts in the synthetic audio. To address this, we
enhance the TCPGen-based contextual biasing approach and propose a
keyword-aware loss function that additionally focuses on biased words when
training biasing modules. This loss includes a masked cross-entropy term for
biased word prediction and a binary classification term for detecting biased
word positions. These two terms complementarily support the decoding of biased
words during inference. By adapting Whisper to 10 hours of synthetic data, our
method reduced the word error rate on the NSC Part 2 test set from 29.71% to
11.81%.

Abstract: Marmoset monkeys exhibit complex vocal communication, challenging the view
that nonhuman primates vocal communication is entirely innate, and show similar
features of human speech, such as vocal labeling of others and turn-taking.
Studying their vocal communication offers a unique opportunity to link it with
brain activity-especially given the difficulty of accessing the human brain in
speech and language research. Since Marmosets communicate primarily through
vocalizations, applying standard LLM approaches is not straightforward. We
introduce Generative Marmoset Spoken Language Modeling (GmSLM), an optimized
spoken language model pipeline for Marmoset vocal communication. We designed a
novel zero-shot evaluation metrics using unsupervised in-the-wild data,
alongside weakly labeled conversational data, to assess GmSLM and demonstrate
its advantage over a basic human-speech-based baseline. GmSLM generated
vocalizations closely matched real resynthesized samples acoustically and
performed well on downstream tasks. Despite being fully unsupervised, GmSLM
effectively distinguish real from artificial conversations and may support
further investigations of the neural basis of vocal communication and provides
a practical framework linking vocalization and brain activity. We believe GmSLM
stands to benefit future work in neuroscience, bioacoustics, and evolutionary
biology. Samples are provided under: pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/GmSLM.

Motivation: 扩展语言模型到更长上下文对于捕捉扩展语篇中的丰富依赖关系至关重要，但简单的上下文扩展会带来显著的计算和内存负担，导致训练和推理效率低下。

Method: CCF框架整合了分段语义聚合与键值记忆编码，形成紧凑表示；采用增量分段解码和稀疏储层采样的训练高效优化策略，大幅降低内存开销。

Conclusion: 结构化压缩在可扩展和有效的长上下文语言建模方面具有巨大潜力，CCF为此提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Scaling language models to longer contexts is essential for capturing rich
dependencies across extended discourse. However, na\"ive context extension
imposes significant computational and memory burdens, often resulting in
inefficiencies during both training and inference. In this work, we propose
CCF, a novel context compression framework designed to enable efficient
long-context modeling by learning hierarchical latent representations that
preserve global semantics while aggressively reducing input redundancy. CCF
integrates segment-wise semantic aggregation with key-value memory encoding,
forming compact representations that support accurate reconstruction and
long-range understanding. To further enhance scalability, we introduce a
training-efficient optimization strategy that couples incremental segment
decoding with sparse reservoir sampling, substantially reducing memory overhead
without degrading performance. Empirical results on multiple long-context
language modeling benchmarks demonstrate that CCF achieves competitive
perplexity under high compression ratios, and significantly improves throughput
and memory efficiency compared to existing approaches. These findings highlight
the potential of structured compression for scalable and effective long-context
language modeling.

Abstract: Accurately assessing candidate seniority from resumes is a critical yet
challenging task, complicated by the prevalence of overstated experience and
ambiguous self-presentation. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of
large language models (LLMs), including fine-tuned BERT architectures, for
automating seniority classification in resumes. To rigorously evaluate model
performance, we introduce a hybrid dataset comprising both real-world resumes
and synthetically generated hard examples designed to simulate exaggerated
qualifications and understated seniority. Using the dataset, we evaluate the
performance of Large Language Models in detecting subtle linguistic cues
associated with seniority inflation and implicit expertise. Our findings
highlight promising directions for enhancing AI-driven candidate evaluation
systems and mitigating bias introduced by self-promotional language. The

Motivation: 缺乏大规模标注数据集限制了监督学习在专利-SDG分类中的应用，现有方法缺乏可扩展性和泛化性

Method: 将专利-SDG分类构建为弱监督问题，使用LLM从专利和SDG论文中提取结构化概念，计算跨域相似度得分，通过基于排名的检索方法组合，使用自定义正损失函数校准标签函数

Result: 内部验证显示方法优于包括transformer模型和零样本LLM在内的多个基线；外部验证通过专利引用网络等图分析显示标签具有更好的主题、认知和组织一致性

Conclusion: 弱监督和语义对齐可以大规模增强SDG分类，为跟踪创新如何应对全球挑战提供了有效工具

Abstract: Classifying patents by their relevance to the UN Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) is crucial for tracking how innovation addresses global
challenges. However, the absence of a large, labeled dataset limits the use of
supervised learning. Existing methods, such as keyword searches, transfer
learning, and citation-based heuristics, lack scalability and generalizability.
This paper frames patent-to-SDG classification as a weak supervision problem,
using citations from patents to SDG-tagged scientific publications (NPL
citations) as a noisy initial signal. To address its sparsity and noise, we
develop a composite labeling function (LF) that uses large language models
(LLMs) to extract structured concepts, namely functions, solutions, and
applications, from patents and SDG papers based on a patent ontology.
Cross-domain similarity scores are computed and combined using a rank-based
retrieval approach. The LF is calibrated via a custom positive-only loss that
aligns with known NPL-SDG links without penalizing discovery of new SDG
associations. The result is a silver-standard, soft multi-label dataset mapping
patents to SDGs, enabling the training of effective multi-label regression
models. We validate our approach through two complementary strategies: (1)
internal validation against held-out NPL-based labels, where our method
outperforms several baselines including transformer-based models, and zero-shot
LLM; and (2) external validation using network modularity in patent citation,
co-inventor, and co-applicant graphs, where our labels reveal greater thematic,
cognitive, and organizational coherence than traditional technological
classifications. These results show that weak supervision and semantic
alignment can enhance SDG classification at scale.

Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法主要针对独立LLM，无法解决RAG系统中响应必须与检索证据一致的特殊挑战，需要专门针对RAG系统的幻觉检测方案。

Method: 四阶段框架：1)将答案分解为原子事实；2)使用同义词和反义词替换生成受控变异；3)根据检索上下文验证每个变体；4)将不一致性惩罚聚合成响应级幻觉分数。

Conclusion: MetaRAG提供了一个实时、无监督、黑盒的幻觉检测框架，特别适用于身份敏感的AI应用，能够定位不支持的声明并配置身份感知的安全保障措施。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise
applications, yet their reliability remains limited by hallucinations, i.e.,
confident but factually incorrect information. Existing detection approaches,
such as SelfCheckGPT and MetaQA, primarily target standalone LLMs and do not
address the unique challenges of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems,
where responses must be consistent with retrieved evidence. We therefore
present MetaRAG, a metamorphic testing framework for hallucination detection in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. MetaRAG operates in a real-time,
unsupervised, black-box setting, requiring neither ground-truth references nor
access to model internals, making it suitable for proprietary and high-stakes
domains. The framework proceeds in four stages: (1) decompose answers into
atomic factoids, (2) generate controlled mutations of each factoid using
synonym and antonym substitutions, (3) verify each variant against the
retrieved context (synonyms are expected to be entailed and antonyms
contradicted), and (4) aggregate penalties for inconsistencies into a
response-level hallucination score. Crucially for identity-aware AI, MetaRAG
localizes unsupported claims at the factoid span where they occur (e.g.,
pregnancy-specific precautions, LGBTQ+ refugee rights, or labor eligibility),
allowing users to see flagged spans and enabling system designers to configure
thresholds and guardrails for identity-sensitive queries. Experiments on a
proprietary enterprise dataset illustrate the effectiveness of MetaRAG for
detecting hallucinations and enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based
conversational agents. We also outline a topic-based deployment design that
translates MetaRAG's span-level scores into identity-aware safeguards; this
design is discussed but not evaluated in our experiments.

Motivation: 类比推理是人类认知的重要方面，但当前NLP研究缺乏从认知科学角度来理解和优化类比推理过程，需要建立认知理论与NLP实践之间的联系。

Method: 总结认知科学文献中关于类比推理过程的关键理论，并将其与自然语言处理中的相关概念进行关联分析，探讨这些认知过程如何应用于NLP挑战。

Result: 发现认知科学的类比推理理论可以很好地与NLP概念关联，但这些关联通常缺乏认知视角的指导，同时证明这些理论对NLP中非直接类比相关的重大挑战也具有相关性。

Conclusion: 认知科学的类比推理理论可以为NLP研究者提供指导，帮助更好地优化文本中的关系理解，而不是过度依赖实体层面的相似性，从而提升NLP系统的推理能力。

Abstract: Analogical reasoning is an essential aspect of human cognition. In this
paper, we summarize key theory about the processes underlying analogical
reasoning from the cognitive science literature and relate it to current
research in natural language processing. While these processes can be easily
linked to concepts in NLP, they are generally not viewed through a cognitive
lens. Furthermore, we show how these notions are relevant for several major
challenges in NLP research, not directly related to analogy solving. This may
guide researchers to better optimize relational understanding in text, as
opposed to relying heavily on entity-level similarity.

sequences, enabling linear-time parsing with $n$ tagging actions, and still
representing reentrancies, cycles, and empty nodes. Compared to existing graph
linearizations, this representation substantially reduces the label space while

Result: 在三个LLM和两个基准数据集上的实验表明，GrACE在开放式生成任务中具有最佳判别能力和校准效果，优于六种竞争方法，且能显著减少测试时缩放所需的样本数量。

Conclusion: GrACE为LLM部署提供了一种实用解决方案，实现了可扩展、可靠和实时的置信度估计，具有在高风险应用中部署的潜力。

Abstract: Assessing the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by confidence
elicitation is a prominent approach to AI safety in high-stakes applications,
such as healthcare and finance. Existing methods either require expensive
computational overhead or suffer from poor calibration, making them impractical
and unreliable for real-world deployment. In this work, we propose GrACE, a
Generative Approach to Confidence Elicitation that enables scalable and
reliable confidence elicitation for LLMs. GrACE adopts a novel mechanism in
which the model expresses confidence by the similarity between the last hidden
state and the embedding of a special token appended to the vocabulary, in
real-time. We fine-tune the model for calibrating the confidence with
calibration targets associated with accuracy. Experiments with three LLMs and
two benchmark datasets show that the confidence produced by GrACE achieves the
best discriminative capacity and calibration on open-ended generation tasks,
outperforming six competing methods without resorting to additional sampling or
an auxiliary model. Moreover, we propose two strategies for improving test-time
scaling based on confidence induced by GrACE. Experimental results show that
using GrACE not only improves the accuracy of the final decision but also
significantly reduces the number of required samples in the test-time scaling
scheme, indicating the potential of GrACE as a practical solution for deploying
LLMs with scalable, reliable, and real-time confidence estimation.

Motivation: 解决简历推荐系统中职位名称匹配的挑战，传统方法受限于词汇重叠有限或误导的问题，需要捕捉超越表面词汇相似性的语义关系。

Method: 自监督混合架构，结合密集句子嵌入和领域特定知识图谱(KG)，使用图神经网络进行KG集成，并将STR分数分为低、中、高三个区域进行分层评估。

Result: KG增强的微调SBERT模型在高STR区域表现最佳，RMSE相比强基线降低了25%，揭示了全局指标隐藏的模型优缺点。

Conclusion: 知识图谱与文本嵌入结合能有效提升语义匹配性能，分层评估方法为人力资源系统中公平性、可解释性和上下文匹配提供了更有针对性的模型选择依据。

Abstract: Semantic Textual Relatedness (STR) captures nuanced relationships between
texts that extend beyond superficial lexical similarity. In this study, we
investigate STR in the context of job title matching - a key challenge in
resume recommendation systems, where overlapping terms are often limited or
misleading. We introduce a self-supervised hybrid architecture that combines
dense sentence embeddings with domain-specific Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to
improve both semantic alignment and explainability. Unlike previous work that
evaluated models on aggregate performance, our approach emphasizes data
stratification by partitioning the STR score continuum into distinct regions:
low, medium, and high semantic relatedness. This stratified evaluation enables
a fine-grained analysis of model performance across semantically meaningful
subspaces. We evaluate several embedding models, both with and without KG
integration via graph neural networks. The results show that fine-tuned SBERT
models augmented with KGs produce consistent improvements in the high-STR
region, where the RMSE is reduced by 25% over strong baselines. Our findings
highlight not only the benefits of combining KGs with text embeddings, but also
the importance of regional performance analysis in understanding model
behavior. This granular approach reveals strengths and weaknesses hidden by
global metrics, and supports more targeted model selection for use in Human
Resources (HR) systems and applications where fairness, explainability, and
contextual matching are essential.

Abstract: This system paper presents the DeMeVa team's approaches to the third edition
of the Learning with Disagreements shared task (LeWiDi 2025; Leonardelli et
al., 2025). We explore two directions: in-context learning (ICL) with large
language models, where we compare example sampling strategies; and label
distribution learning (LDL) methods with RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b), where we
evaluate several fine-tuning methods. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we
show that ICL can effectively predict annotator-specific annotations
(perspectivist annotations), and that aggregating these predictions into soft
labels yields competitive performance; and (2) we argue that LDL methods are
promising for soft label predictions and merit further exploration by the
perspectivist community.

Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLMs)快速重塑了金融NLP领域，但传统调查方法跟不上这种变革速度，需要一种结构化的方法来理解研究趋势和发展脉络。

Method: 定义了金融NLP研究本体论，基于LLM的提取管道处理了681篇论文(2022-2025)，构建可查询的知识图谱进行大规模数据分析。

Result: 揭示了三个关键阶段：早期LLM采用和任务/数据集创新；对LLM局限性的批判性反思；以及外围技术向模块化系统的日益整合。

Conclusion: MetaGraph提供了对金融NLP演变的清晰理解，突出了新兴趋势和方法论转变，同时展示了可在其他领域复用的科学进展映射方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly reshaped financial NLP, enabling
new tasks and driving a proliferation of datasets and diversification of data
sources. Yet, this transformation has outpaced traditional surveys. In this
paper, we present MetaGraph, a generalizable methodology for extracting
knowledge graphs from scientific literature and analyzing them to obtain a
structured, queryable view of research trends. We define an ontology for
financial NLP research and apply an LLM-based extraction pipeline to 681 papers
(2022-2025), enabling large-scale, data-driven analysis. MetaGraph reveals
three key phases: early LLM adoption and task/dataset innovation; critical
reflection on LLM limitations; and growing integration of peripheral techniques
into modular systems. This structured view offers both practitioners and
researchers a clear understanding of how financial NLP has evolved -
highlighting emerging trends, shifting priorities, and methodological
shifts-while also demonstrating a reusable approach for mapping scientific
progress in other domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线课程环境对社交联系造成障碍，现有SAMI系统因缺乏完整的心理理论而限制了推荐效果，特别是无法预测人格特质

Method: 提出一种人格检测模型，利用GPT的零械打胎能力从在线课程论坛介绍贴子中推断五大人格特质，并与现有模型进行性能对比

Result: 模型在人格检测任务上表现有效，成功集成到SAMI的实体基于匹配系统中，实现了基于人格的社交推荐

Conclusion: 人格特质可以补充现有匹配因素，但需要进一步评估来确定它们对学生参与度和匹配质量的完整影响

Abstract: Social connection is a vital part of learning, yet online course environments
present barriers to the organic formation of social groups. SAMI offers one
solution by facilitating student connections, but its effectiveness is
constrained by an incomplete Theory of Mind, limiting its ability to create an
effective mental model of a student. One facet of this is its inability to
intuit personality, which may influence the relevance of its recommendations.
To explore this, we propose a personality detection model utilizing GPTs
zero-shot capability to infer Big-Five personality traits from forum
introduction posts, often encouraged in online courses. We benchmark its
performance against established models, demonstrating its efficacy in this
task. Furthermore, we integrate this model into SAMIs entity-based matchmaking
system, enabling personality-informed social recommendations. Initial
integration suggests personality traits can complement existing matching
factors, though additional evaluation is required to determine their full
impact on student engagement and match quality.

TL;DR: EXPRESS基准数据集评估LLM在细粒度情感识别方面与人类情感的对齐程度，发现现有模型在准确预测与人类自我披露情感一致的情感方面仍存在挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注将情感分类到预定义的有限类别中，忽视了更细致的情感表达，需要评估LLM是否能在细粒度水平上与人类情感对齐

Method: 引入EXPRESS基准数据集（包含251个细粒度情感标签），通过综合评估框架分析预测情感术语并将其分解为八种基本情感，系统测试主流LLM在不同提示设置下的表现

Result: LLM准确预测与人类自我披露情感一致的情感仍然具有挑战性；某些LLM能生成符合情感理论和定义的情感术语，但在捕捉上下文线索方面不如人类自我披露有效

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在细粒度情感对齐方面的局限性，为未来增强其上下文理解能力的研究提供了见解

Abstract: The versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language
understanding has made them increasingly popular in mental health research.
While many studies explore LLMs' capabilities in emotion recognition, a
critical gap remains in evaluating whether LLMs align with human emotions at a
fine-grained level. Existing research typically focuses on classifying emotions
into predefined, limited categories, overlooking more nuanced expressions. To
address this gap, we introduce EXPRESS, a benchmark dataset curated from Reddit
communities featuring 251 fine-grained, self-disclosed emotion labels. Our
comprehensive evaluation framework examines predicted emotion terms and
decomposes them into eight basic emotions using established emotion theories,
enabling a fine-grained comparison. Systematic testing of prevalent LLMs under
various prompt settings reveals that accurately predicting emotions that align
with human self-disclosed emotions remains challenging. Qualitative analysis
further shows that while certain LLMs generate emotion terms consistent with
established emotion theories and definitions, they sometimes fail to capture
contextual cues as effectively as human self-disclosures. These findings
highlight the limitations of LLMs in fine-grained emotion alignment and offer
insights for future research aimed at enhancing their contextual understanding.

Abstract: Verbal autopsy (VA) is a critical tool for estimating causes of death in
resource-limited settings where medical certification is unavailable. This
study presents LA-VA, a proof-of-concept pipeline that combines Large Language

classification for improved cause-of-death prediction. Using the Population
Health Metrics Research Consortium (PHMRC) dataset across three age categories
(Adult: 7,580; Child: 1,960; Neonate: 2,438), we evaluate multiple approaches:
GPT-5 predictions, LCVA baseline, text embeddings, and meta-learner ensembles.
Our results demonstrate that GPT-5 achieves the highest individual performance
with average test site accuracies of 48.6% (Adult), 50.5% (Child), and 53.5%
(Neonate), outperforming traditional statistical machine learning baselines by
5-10%. Our findings suggest that simple off-the-shelf LLM-assisted approaches
could substantially improve verbal autopsy accuracy, with important
implications for global health surveillance in low-resource settings.

Result: 在六个基准测试中超越最先进基线，held-in任务平均提升3.1%，held-out任务平均提升4.4%

Conclusion: MOAT通过迭代对齐实现了多智能体的有效协作，理论分析证明其训练过程非递减且渐进收敛

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the construction
of multi-agent systems to solve complex tasks by dividing responsibilities
among specialized agents, such as a planning agent for subgoal generation and a
grounding agent for executing tool-use actions. Most existing methods typically
fine-tune these agents independently, leading to capability gaps among them
with poor coordination. To address this, we propose MOAT, a Multi-Agent Joint
Alignment Tuning framework that improves agents collaboration through iterative
alignment. MOAT alternates between two key stages: (1) Planning Agent
Alignment, which optimizes the planning agent to generate subgoal sequences
that better guide the grounding agent; and (2) Grounding Agent Improving, which
fine-tunes the grounding agent using diverse subgoal-action pairs generated by
the agent itself to enhance its generalization capablity. Theoretical analysis
proves that MOAT ensures a non-decreasing and progressively convergent training
process. Experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that MOAT outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 3.1% on held-in
tasks and 4.4% on held-out tasks.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型在心算数学任务中的内部运作机制，探索自注意力和多层感知机层如何让每个token访问和处理所有之前token的信息

Method: 使用上下文感知平均消除(CAMA)和注意力基于探观(ABP)两种新方法，逐步抑制初始层的输入特徚计算、限制中间层的信息传递路径、强制末尾层在最后一个token进行所有计算

Result: 发现了高精度的All-for-One子图(AF1)，其中有意义的计算仅在深层的最后一个token进行，通过特定中间层从其他token获取信息，该子图对模型性能既充分又必要

Conclusion: 大语言模型在心算数学任务中存在特定的All-for-One计算模式，CAMA和ABP方法在探索模型内部机制方面具有独特优势

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate proficiency across numerous
computational tasks, yet their inner workings remain unclear. In theory, the
combination of causal self-attention and multilayer perceptron layers allows
every token to access and compute information based on all preceding tokens. In
practice, to what extent are such operations present? In this paper, on mental
math tasks (i.e., direct math calculation via next-token prediction without
explicit reasoning), we investigate this question in three steps: inhibiting
input-specific token computations in the initial layers, restricting the routes
of information transfer across token positions in the next few layers, and
forcing all computation to happen at the last token in the remaining layers.
With two proposed techniques, Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA) and
Attention-Based Peeking (ABP), we identify an All-for-One subgraph (AF1) with
high accuracy on a wide variety of mental math tasks, where meaningful
computation occurs very late (in terms of layer depth) and only at the last
token, which receives information of other tokens in few specific middle
layers. Experiments on a variety of models and arithmetic expressions show that
this subgraph is sufficient and necessary for high model performance, transfers
across different models, and works on a variety of input styles. Ablations on
different CAMA and ABP alternatives reveal their unique advantages over other
methods, which may be of independent interest.

Motivation: Mixture-of-Experts模型中的专家网络具有特定的行为模式，但缺乏对这些专家进行精确控制的方法，无法在不重新训练的情况下调整模型行为

Method: 通过检测在对比行为输入对中表现出不同激活模式的专家，在推理时选择性地激活或停用这些行为相关专家

Result: 在11个基准测试和6个LLM上，安全性能提升达+20%，忠实度提升+27%；在对抗模式下，安全性可降低-41%，与现有越狱方法结合可完全绕过所有安全防护

Conclusion: SteerMoE揭示了MoE模型中专家层面存在的对齐伪装新维度，提供了一种无需权重修改的行为控制方法

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) in Large Language Models (LLMs) routes each token
through a subset of specialized Feed-Forward Networks (FFN), known as experts.
We present SteerMoE, a framework for steering MoE models by detecting and
controlling behavior-linked experts. Our detection method identifies experts
with distinct activation patterns across paired inputs exhibiting contrasting
behaviors. By selectively (de)activating such experts during inference, we
control behaviors like faithfulness and safety without retraining or modifying
weights. Across 11 benchmarks and 6 LLMs, our steering raises safety by up to
+20% and faithfulness by +27%. In adversarial attack mode, it drops safety by
-41% alone, and -100% when combined with existing jailbreak methods, bypassing
all safety guardrails and exposing a new dimension of alignment faking hidden
within experts.

Motivation: 当前RLVR方法存在探索不足、过早收敛和熵崩塌的问题，需要更好的探索机制来提升大语言模型的推理能力

Method: 使用演员的困惑度和评论家多头架构的价值估计方差作为内在好奇心信号，构建探索奖励框架，理论分析显示该方法能惩罚过度自信错误并促进答案多样性

Conclusion: CDE框架通过内在好奇心信号有效解决了RLVR的探索问题，提升了模型性能，并为理解LLM失败模式提供了新见解

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet
current RLVR methods often explore poorly, leading to premature convergence and
entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we introduce Curiosity-Driven
Exploration (CDE), a framework that leverages the model's own intrinsic sense
of curiosity to guide exploration. We formalize curiosity with signals from
both the actor and the critic: for the actor, we use perplexity over its
generated response, and for the critic, we use the variance of value estimates
from a multi-head architecture. Both signals serve as an exploration bonus
within the RLVR framework to guide the model. Our theoretical analysis shows
that the actor-wise bonus inherently penalizes overconfident errors and
promotes diversity among correct responses; moreover, we connect the
critic-wise bonus to the well-established count-based exploration bonus in RL.
Empirically, our method achieves an approximate +3 point improvement over
standard RLVR using GRPO/PPO on AIME benchmarks. Further analysis identifies a
calibration collapse mechanism within RLVR, shedding light on common LLM
failure modes.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multimodal retrieval and its application in
LLMs and multimodal LLMs, increasingly complex retrieval tasks have emerged.
Existing methods predominantly rely on task-specific fine-tuning of
vision-language models and are limited to single-modality queries or documents.
In this paper, we propose ReT-2, a unified retrieval model that supports
multimodal queries, composed of both images and text, and searches across
multimodal document collections where text and images coexist. ReT-2 leverages
multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with
LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across
layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details. We
evaluate ReT-2 on the challenging M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different
retrieval configurations. Results demonstrate that ReT-2 consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across diverse settings, while offering faster
inference and reduced memory usage compared to prior approaches. When
integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, ReT-2 also improves
downstream performance on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek datasets. Our source

Conclusion: 该方法使机器动作识别更接近人类级别的鲁棒性，为跨域动作识别提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Humans can recognize the same actions despite large context and viewpoint
variations, such as differences between species (walking in spiders vs.
horses), viewpoints (egocentric vs. third-person), and contexts (real life vs
movies). Current deep learning models struggle with such generalization. We
propose using features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM), aggregated
via a transformer, to achieve human-like action recognition across these
challenging conditions. We find that generalization is enhanced by the use of a
model conditioned on earlier timesteps of the diffusion process to highlight
semantic information over pixel level details in the extracted features. We
experimentally explore the generalization properties of our approach in
classifying actions across animal species, across different viewing angles, and
different recording contexts. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art across all
three generalization benchmarks, bringing machine action recognition closer to
human-like robustness. Project page:

VulnGuard integrates few-shot examples from curated GitHub repositories,
ethical chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive role-prompting to create

multi-objective optimization with formal proofs demonstrating 25-30% analytical
harm reduction through entropy bounds and Pareto optimality. PromptGuard
orchestrates six core modules: Input Classification, VulnGuard Prompting,
Ethical Principles Integration, External Tool Interaction, Output Validation,

Motivation: Re-ID方法对标签噪声高度敏感，传统方法在噪声环境下性能显著下降，需要鲁棒的噪声处理方案

Method: 将Re-ID重构为监督图像相似度任务，采用Siamese网络架构，结合Beta混合分布建模相似度分布进行异常检测，使用交叉熵、对比和余弦嵌入损失联合优化

Result: 在CUHK03、Market-1501和VeRi-776数据集上，在10-30%噪声水平下均优于现有方法，表现出鲁棒性和广泛适用性

Conclusion: Beta-SOD通过统计异常检测框架有效处理Re-ID中的标签噪声问题，为噪声环境下的Re-ID任务提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Object re-identification (Re-ID) methods are highly sensitive to label noise,
which typically leads to significant performance degradation. We address this
challenge by reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task and adopting
a Siamese network architecture trained to capture discriminative pairwise
relationships. Central to our approach is a novel statistical outlier detection
(OD) framework, termed Beta-SOD (Beta mixture Similarity-based Outlier
Detection), which models the distribution of cosine similarities between
embedding pairs using a two-component Beta distribution mixture model. We
establish a novel identifiability result for mixtures of two Beta
distributions, ensuring that our learning task is well-posed.The proposed OD
step complements the Re-ID architecture combining binary cross-entropy,
contrastive, and cosine embedding losses that jointly optimize feature-level
similarity learning.We demonstrate the effectiveness of Beta-SOD in de-noising
and Re-ID tasks for person Re-ID, on CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets, and
vehicle Re-ID, on VeRi-776 dataset. Our method shows superior performance
compared to the state-of-the-art methods across various noise levels (10-30\%),
demonstrating both robustness and broad applicability in noisy Re-ID scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冠状动脉疾病是全球主要死因之一，ICA作为诊断金标准需要精确的血管分割和狭窄检测。但ICA图像存在低对比度、高噪声和复杂血管结构等挑战，现有方法难以满足临床需求。

Method: 提出SFD-Mamba2Net框架：编码器嵌入曲率感知结构增强模块(CASE)突出管状血管结构；解码器引入渐进高频感知模块(PHFP)通过小波分解逐步细化高频细节并整合低频全局结构。

Result: 在八个分割指标上均优于最先进方法，在狭窄检测中实现了最高的真阳性率和阳性预测值。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结构先验和频域增强策略有效解决了ICA图像分割和狭窄检测的挑战，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Background: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of
death worldwide. Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA), regarded as the gold
standard for CAD diagnosis, necessitates precise vessel segmentation and
stenosis detection. However, ICA images are typically characterized by low
contrast, high noise levels, and complex, fine-grained vascular structures,
which pose significant challenges to the clinical adoption of existing
segmentation and detection methods. Objective: This study aims to improve the
accuracy of coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA images
by integrating multi-scale structural priors, state-space-based long-range
dependency modeling, and frequency-domain detail enhancement strategies.
Methods: We propose SFD-Mamba2Net, an end-to-end framework tailored for
ICA-based vascular segmentation and stenosis detection. In the encoder, a
Curvature-Aware Structural Enhancement (CASE) module is embedded to leverage
multi-scale responses for highlighting slender tubular vascular structures,
suppressing background interference, and directing attention toward vascular
regions. In the decoder, we introduce a Progressive High-Frequency Perception
(PHFP) module that employs multi-level wavelet decomposition to progressively
refine high-frequency details while integrating low-frequency global
structures. Results and Conclusions: SFD-Mamba2Net consistently outperformed
state-of-the-art methods across eight segmentation metrics, and achieved the
highest true positive rate and positive predictive value in stenosis detection.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Colorectal cancer frequently metastasizes to the liver, significantly
reducing long-term survival. While surgical resection is the only potentially
curative treatment for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), patient outcomes
vary widely depending on tumor characteristics along with clinical and genomic
factors. Current prognostic models, often based on limited clinical or
molecular features, lack sufficient predictive power, especially in multifocal
CRLM cases. We present a fully automated framework for surgical outcome
prediction from pre- and post-contrast MRI acquired before surgery. Our
framework consists of a segmentation pipeline and a radiomics pipeline. The
segmentation pipeline learns to segment the liver, tumors, and spleen from
partially annotated data by leveraging promptable foundation models to complete
missing labels. Also, we propose SAMONAI, a novel zero-shot 3D prompt
propagation algorithm that leverages the Segment Anything Model to segment 3D
regions of interest from a single point prompt, significantly improving our
segmentation pipeline's accuracy and efficiency. The predicted pre- and
post-contrast segmentations are then fed into our radiomics pipeline, which
extracts features from each tumor and predicts survival using SurvAMINN, a
novel autoencoder-based multiple instance neural network for survival analysis.
SurvAMINN jointly learns dimensionality reduction and hazard prediction from
right-censored survival data, focusing on the most aggressive tumors. Extensive
evaluation on an institutional dataset comprising 227 patients demonstrates
that our framework surpasses existing clinical and genomic biomarkers,
delivering a C-index improvement exceeding 10%. Our results demonstrate the
potential of integrating automated segmentation algorithms and radiomics-based
survival analysis to deliver accurate, annotation-efficient, and interpretable

Motivation: 研究不同生成模型在相同文本提示下产生的视觉表示差异，探索模型间的概念分歧和特定属性偏好

Method: 提出CompCon进化搜索算法，自动发现一个模型比另一个模型更常生成的视觉属性，并关联到触发这些差异的提示概念；构建ID2数据集包含60个输入依赖差异

Conclusion: CompCon能有效识别生成模型间的视觉表示差异，为理解模型偏见和特性提供了系统化分析工具

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate when and how visual representations learned by
two different generative models diverge. Given two text-to-image models, our
goal is to discover visual attributes that appear in images generated by one
model but not the other, along with the types of prompts that trigger these
attribute differences. For example, "flames" might appear in one model's
outputs when given prompts expressing strong emotions, while the other model
does not produce this attribute given the same prompts. We introduce CompCon
(Comparing Concepts), an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual
attributes more prevalent in one model's output than the other, and uncovers
the prompt concepts linked to these visual differences. To evaluate CompCon's
ability to find diverging representations, we create an automated data
generation pipeline to produce ID2, a dataset of 60 input-dependent
differences, and compare our approach to several LLM- and VLM-powered
baselines. Finally, we use CompCon to compare popular text-to-image models,
finding divergent representations such as how PixArt depicts prompts mentioning
loneliness with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicts African American
people in media professions. Code at: https://github.com/adobe-research/CompCon

Abstract: The use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) has increased tremendously in the
current decade. They have significantly advanced remote sensing with the
capability to deploy and image the terrain as per required spatial, spectral,
temporal, and radiometric resolutions for various remote sensing applications.
One of the major advantages of UAS imagery is that images can be acquired in
cloudy conditions by flying the UAS under the clouds. The limitation to the
technology is that the imagery is often sullied by cloud shadows. Images taken
over water are additionally affected by sun glint. These are two pose serious
issues for estimating water quality parameters from the UAS images. This study
proposes a novel machine learning approach first to identify and extract
regions with cloud shadows and sun glint and separate such regions from
non-obstructed clear sky regions and sun-glint unaffected regions. The data was
extracted from the images at pixel level to train an U-Net based deep learning
model and best settings for model training was identified based on the various
evaluation metrics from test cases. Using this evaluation, a high-quality image
correction model was determined, which was used to recover the cloud shadow and
sun glint areas in the images.

Motivation: 解决Vision Transformer在小数据集上因缺乏局部性和平移等变性等归纳偏置而导致局部特征提取不足的问题

Method: 在分层移位窗口注意力机制中集成可学习的局部特征增强模块，同时捕获细粒度空间细节和全局语义结构

Result: 在多个基准数据集上优于最先进的卷积和Transformer模型，CIFAR-10提升2.17%，CIFAR-100提升4.92%，Tiny ImageNet提升4.47%

Conclusion: 局部-全局特征融合有效增强了Transformer在小规模视觉任务中的泛化能力和鲁棒性

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive results in computer
vision by leveraging self-attention to model long-range dependencies. However,
their emphasis on global context often comes at the expense of local feature
extraction in small datasets, particularly due to the lack of key inductive
biases such as locality and translation equivariance. To mitigate this, we
propose CoSwin, a novel feature-fusion architecture that augments the
hierarchical shifted window attention with localized convolutional feature
learning. Specifically, CoSwin integrates a learnable local feature enhancement
module into each attention block, enabling the model to simultaneously capture
fine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure. We evaluate CoSwin
on multiple image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
MNIST, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet. Our experimental results show consistent
performance gains over state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based
models. Notably, CoSwin achieves improvements of 2.17% on CIFAR-10, 4.92% on
CIFAR-100, 0.10% on MNIST, 0.26% on SVHN, and 4.47% on Tiny ImageNet over the
baseline Swin Transformer. These improvements underscore the effectiveness of
local-global feature fusion in enhancing the generalization and robustness of
transformers for small-scale vision. Code and pretrained weights available at

Conclusion: iMatcher框架通过结合局部和全局一致性学习，在多个真实世界数据集上实现了优异的特征匹配性能，证明了其在点云配准中的有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper presents iMatcher, a fully differentiable framework for feature
matching in point cloud registration. The proposed method leverages learned
features to predict a geometrically consistent confidence matrix, incorporating
both local and global consistency. First, a local graph embedding module leads
to an initialization of the score matrix. A subsequent repositioning step
refines this matrix by considering bilateral source-to-target and
target-to-source matching via nearest neighbor search in 3D space. The paired
point features are then stacked together to be refined through global geometric
consistency learning to predict a point-wise matching probability. Extensive
experiments on real-world outdoor (KITTI, KITTI-360) and indoor (3DMatch)
datasets, as well as on 6-DoF pose estimation (TUD-L) and partial-to-partial
matching (MVP-RG), demonstrate that iMatcher significantly improves rigid
registration performance. The method achieves state-of-the-art inlier ratios,
scoring 95% - 97% on KITTI, 94% - 97% on KITTI-360, and up to 81.1% on 3DMatch,
highlighting its robustness across diverse settings.

Conclusion: 该方法为更准确的3D重建铺平了道路，代码和数据集将公开提供

Abstract: In free-hand ultrasound imaging, sonographers rely on expertise to mentally
integrate partial 2D views into 3D anatomical shapes. Shape reconstruction can
assist clinicians in this process. Central to this task is the choice of shape
representation, as it determines how accurately and efficiently the structure
can be visualized, analyzed, and interpreted. Implicit representations, such as
SDF and occupancy function, offer a powerful alternative to traditional voxel-
or mesh-based methods by modeling continuous, smooth surfaces with compact
storage, avoiding explicit discretization. Recent studies demonstrate that SDF
can be effectively optimized using annotations derived from segmented B-mode
ultrasound images. Yet, these approaches hinge on precise annotations,
overlooking the rich acoustic information embedded in B-mode intensity.
Moreover, implicit representation approaches struggle with the ultrasound's
view-dependent nature and acoustic shadowing artifacts, which impair
reconstruction. To address the problems resulting from occlusions and
annotation dependency, we propose an occupancy-based representation and
introduce \gls{UltrON} that leverages acoustic features to improve geometric
consistency in weakly-supervised optimization regime. We show that these
features can be obtained from B-mode images without additional annotation cost.
Moreover, we propose a novel loss function that compensates for view-dependency
in the B-mode images and facilitates occupancy optimization from multiview
ultrasound. By incorporating acoustic properties, \gls{UltrON} generalizes to
shapes of the same anatomy. We show that \gls{UltrON} mitigates the limitations
of occlusions and sparse labeling and paves the way for more accurate 3D
reconstruction. Code and dataset will be available at

Conclusion: INR基模型适用于大型CMR数据集中心肌应变的准确且可扩展分析

Abstract: Automatic quantification of intramyocardial motion and strain from tagging
MRI remains an important but challenging task. We propose a method using
implicit neural representations (INRs), conditioned on learned latent codes, to
predict continuous left ventricular (LV) displacement -- without requiring

achieved the best tracking accuracy (2.14 mm RMSE) and the lowest combined
error in global circumferential (2.86%) and radial (6.42%) strain compared to
three deep learning baselines. In addition, our method is $\sim$380$\times$
faster than the most accurate baseline. These results highlight the suitability
of INR-based models for accurate and scalable analysis of myocardial strain in

TL;DR: E-MLNet提出动态加权策略改进通用域适应，通过聚焦相关类别边界来更好地区分已知和未知类别，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如MLNet对所有分类器同等对待，导致学习信号被稀释，需要更有效的策略来增强已知和未知类别的区分能力。

Method: E-MLNet在MLNet基础上集成动态加权策略，利用闭集分类器的预测结果，针对每个目标样本聚焦最相关的类别边界进行适应。

Result: 在Office-31、Office-Home、VisDA-2017和ImageCLEF四个基准测试中，E-MLNet在VisDA和ImageCLEF上获得最高平均H分数，在Open-Partial DA和Open-Set DA设置中分别以22/31和19/31的优势超越MLNet基线。

Conclusion: 动态加权策略有效提升了通用域适应性能，E-MLNet展示了聚焦适应策略的优越性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) seeks to transfer knowledge from a
labeled source to an unlabeled target domain without assuming any relationship
between their label sets, requiring models to classify known samples while
rejecting unknown ones. Advanced methods like Mutual Learning Network (MLNet)
use a bank of one-vs-all classifiers adapted via Open-set Entropy Minimization
(OEM). However, this strategy treats all classifiers equally, diluting the
learning signal. We propose the Enhanced Mutual Learning Network (E-MLNet),
which integrates a dynamic weighting strategy to OEM. By leveraging the
closed-set classifier's predictions, E-MLNet focuses adaptation on the most
relevant class boundaries for each target sample, sharpening the distinction
between known and unknown classes. We conduct extensive experiments on four
challenging benchmarks: Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, and ImageCLEF. The
results demonstrate that E-MLNet achieves the highest average H-scores on VisDA
and ImageCLEF and exhibits superior robustness over its predecessor. E-MLNet
outperforms the strong MLNet baseline in the majority of individual adaptation
tasks -- 22 out of 31 in the challenging Open-Partial DA setting and 19 out of
31 in the Open-Set DA setting -- confirming the benefits of our focused
adaptation strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乌尔都语作为有超过250万人使用的语言，在多模态和视觉-语言研究中很少得到支持，缺乏大规模高质量数据集限制了乌尔都语系统的发展，并加剧了多语言模型的偏见。

Method: 从MS COCO数据集派生构建COCO-Urdu，通过分层采样保留原始分布。使用SeamlessM4T v2进行翻译，并采用混合多模态质量估计框架进行验证，包括COMET-Kiwi翻译质量、CLIP基于视觉基础的相似性、BERTScore和反向翻译语义一致性。低分标注通过开源大语言模型迭代精炼。

Result: 在BLEU、SacreBLEU和chrF指标上进行了基准测试，报告了一致强劲的结果。COCO-Urdu是目前最大的公开乌尔都语标注数据集。

Conclusion: 通过释放数据集和质量估计流水线，该研究旨在减少多模态研究中的语言偏见，为包容性视觉-语言系统建立基础。

Abstract: Urdu, spoken by over 250 million people, remains critically under-served in
multimodal and vision-language research. The absence of large-scale,
high-quality datasets has limited the development of Urdu-capable systems and
reinforced biases in multilingual vision-language models trained primarily on
high-resource languages. To address this gap, we present COCO-Urdu, a
large-scale image-caption dataset derived from MS COCO, containing 59,000
images and 319,000 Urdu captions selected through stratified sampling to
preserve the original distribution. Captions were translated using SeamlessM4T
v2 and validated with a hybrid multimodal quality estimation framework that
integrates COMET-Kiwi for translation quality, CLIP-based similarity for visual
grounding, and BERTScore with back-translation for semantic consistency;
low-scoring captions were iteratively refined using open-source large language
models. We further benchmark COCO-Urdu on BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF, reporting
consistently strong results. To the best of our knowledge, COCO-Urdu is the
largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset. By releasing both the
dataset and the quality estimation pipeline, we aim to reduce language bias in
multimodal research and establish a foundation for inclusive vision-language
systems.

Conclusion: PCGM是合成MRI在研究细微形态差异方面应用的重要里程碑，能够生成解剖学合理且保留医学相关细微变化的脑部MRI图像

Abstract: 3D brain MRI studies often examine subtle morphometric differences between
cohorts that are hard to detect visually. Given the high cost of MRI
acquisition, these studies could greatly benefit from image syntheses,
particularly counterfactual image generation, as seen in other domains, such as
computer vision. However, counterfactual models struggle to produce
anatomically plausible MRIs due to the lack of explicit inductive biases to
preserve fine-grained anatomical details. This shortcoming arises from the
training of the models aiming to optimize for the overall appearance of the
images (e.g., via cross-entropy) rather than preserving subtle, yet medically
relevant, local variations across subjects. To preserve subtle variations, we
propose to explicitly integrate anatomical constraints on a voxel-level as
prior into a generative diffusion framework. Called Probabilistic Causal Graph
Model (PCGM), the approach captures anatomical constraints via a probabilistic
graph module and translates those constraints into spatial binary masks of
regions where subtle variations occur. The masks (encoded by a 3D extension of
ControlNet) constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet, whose encodings
are then transferred into high-quality brain MRIs via our 3D diffusion decoder.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that PCGM generates
structural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baseline approaches.
Furthermore, we show for the first time that brain measurements extracted from
counterfactuals (generated by PCGM) replicate the subtle effects of a disease
on cortical brain regions previously reported in the neuroscience literature.
This achievement is an important milestone in the use of synthetic MRIs in
studies investigating subtle morphological differences.

Abstract: Understanding 3D medical image volumes is critical in the medical field, yet
existing 3D medical convolution and transformer-based self-supervised learning

multimodal large language models (MLLMs) provide a promising approach to
enhance image understanding through text descriptions. To leverage these 2D
MLLMs for improved 3D medical image understanding, we propose Med3DInsight, a
novel pretraining framework that integrates 3D image encoders with 2D MLLMs via
a specially designed plane-slice-aware transformer module. Additionally, our
model employs a partial optimal transport based alignment, demonstrating
greater tolerance to noise introduced by potential noises in LLM-generated

Abstract: Recent graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have shown high performance
in the field of human action recognition by using human skeleton poses.
However, it fails to detect human-object interaction cases successfully due to
the lack of effective representation of the scene information and appropriate

human action recognition performance by considering fixed object information in
the environment and following a multi-task learning approach. In order to
evaluate the proposed method, we collected real data from public environments
and prepared our data set, which includes interaction classes of hands-on fixed
objects (e.g., ATM ticketing machines, check-in/out machines, etc.) and
non-interaction classes of walking and standing. The multi-task learning
approach, along with interaction area information, succeeds in recognizing the
studied interaction and non-interaction actions with an accuracy of 99.25%,
outperforming the accuracy of the base model using only human skeleton poses by

Abstract: Current multispectral object detection methods often retain extraneous
background or noise during feature fusion, limiting perceptual performance.To
address this, we propose an innovative feature fusion framework based on
cross-modal feature contrastive and screening strategy, diverging from
conventional approaches. The proposed method adaptively enhances salient
structures by fusing object-aware complementary cross-modal features while
suppressing shared background interference.Our solution centers on two novel,
specially designed modules: the Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and the
Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM). The MFRM enhances intra- and
inter-modal feature representations by modeling their relationships, thereby
improving cross-modal alignment and discriminative power.Inspired by feedback
differential amplifiers, the DFFM dynamically computes inter-modal differential
features as guidance signals and feeds them back to the MFRM, enabling adaptive
fusion of complementary information while suppressing common-mode noise across
modalities. To enable robust feature learning, the MFRM and DFFM are integrated
into a unified framework, which is formally formulated as an Iterative
Relation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism, termed IRDFusion.
IRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion by progressively amplifying
salient relational signals through iterative feedback, while suppressing
feature noise, leading to significant performance gains.In extensive
experiments on FLIR, LLVIP and M$^3$FD datasets, IRDFusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms existing methods
across diverse challenging scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and
effectiveness. Code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型计算和内存成本过高，且传统的量化和token剪枝方法存在不兼容问题，无法同时实现效率提升

Method: 提出新的量化感知token剪枝标准，在激进量化模型上工作，同时改进量化器设计以增强剪枝效果

Result: 在标准VLA模型上实现了1.93倍推理加速，平均成功率提升4.5%，同时保持了核心模型性能

Conclusion: SQAP-VLA首次实现了量化和token剪枝的协同优化，为VLA模型的实用部署提供了有效的加速解决方案

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models exhibit unprecedented capabilities for
embodied intelligence. However, their extensive computational and memory costs
hinder their practical deployment. Existing VLA compression and acceleration
approaches conduct quantization or token pruning in an ad-hoc manner but fail
to enable both for a holistic efficiency improvement due to an observed
incompatibility. This work introduces SQAP-VLA, the first structured,
training-free VLA inference acceleration framework that simultaneously enables
state-of-the-art quantization and token pruning. We overcome the
incompatibility by co-designing the quantization and token pruning pipeline,
where we propose new quantization-aware token pruning criteria that work on an
aggressively quantized model while improving the quantizer design to enhance
pruning effectiveness. When applied to standard VLA models, SQAP-VLA yields
significant gains in computational efficiency and inference speed while
successfully preserving core model performance, achieving a $\times$1.93
speedup and up to a 4.5\% average success rate enhancement compared to the
original model.

TL;DR: S-BEVLoc是一个基于鸟瞰图的自监督LiDAR全局定位框架，无需地面真实位姿，通过地理距离构建训练三元组，在KITTI和NCLT数据集上实现最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LiDAR全局定位方法依赖GPS或SLAM里程计获取的地面真实位姿进行监督训练，但高精度位姿获取成本高昂且费力。

Method: 提出自监督框架，利用单张BEV图像中关键点中心BEV补丁之间的已知地理距离构建训练三元组，使用CNN提取局部特征，NetVLAD聚合全局描述符，并引入SoftCos损失函数增强学习。

Result: 在KITTI和NCLT大规模数据集上的实验表明，S-BEVLoc在位置识别、闭环检测和全局定位任务中达到最先进性能，同时具有出色的可扩展性。

Conclusion: S-BEVLoc成功消除了对地面真实位姿的依赖，提供了一种高度可扩展的自监督LiDAR全局定位解决方案，为实际应用提供了更实用的方法。

Abstract: LiDAR-based global localization is an essential component of simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM), which helps loop closure and re-localization.
Current approaches rely on ground-truth poses obtained from GPS or SLAM
odometry to supervise network training. Despite the great success of these
supervised approaches, substantial cost and effort are required for
high-precision ground-truth pose acquisition. In this work, we propose
S-BEVLoc, a novel self-supervised framework based on bird's-eye view (BEV) for
LiDAR global localization, which eliminates the need for ground-truth poses and
is highly scalable. We construct training triplets from single BEV images by
leveraging the known geographic distances between keypoint-centered BEV
patches. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract local features,
and NetVLAD is employed to aggregate global descriptors. Moreover, we introduce
SoftCos loss to enhance learning from the generated triplets. Experimental
results on the large-scale KITTI and NCLT datasets show that S-BEVLoc achieves
state-of-the-art performance in place recognition, loop closure, and global
localization tasks, while offering scalability that would require extra effort
for supervised approaches.

Abstract: The widespread use of mobile devices has created new challenges for vision
systems in safety monitoring, workplace productivity assessment, and attention
management. Detecting whether a person is using a phone requires not only
object recognition but also an understanding of behavioral context, which
involves reasoning about the relationship between faces, hands, and devices
under diverse conditions. Existing generic benchmarks do not fully capture such
fine-grained human--device interactions. To address this gap, we introduce the
FPI-Det, containing 22{,}879 images with synchronized annotations for faces and
phones across workplace, education, transportation, and public scenarios. The
dataset features extreme scale variation, frequent occlusions, and varied
capture conditions. We evaluate representative YOLO and DETR detectors,
providing baseline results and an analysis of performance across object sizes,
occlusion levels, and environments. Source code and dataset is available at

TL;DR: ZeroPlantSeg是一个零样本分割方法，用于从顶视图图像中分割莲座状植物个体，无需额外训练即可实现跨物种和生长阶段的植物个体分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础分割模型虽然能在零样本情况下从顶视图作物图像中提取叶片实例，但分割包含多个重叠叶片的完整植物个体仍然具有挑战性。现有的分层分割方法通常需要物种特定的标注数据集和大量人工劳动。

Method: 结合基础分割模型（提取叶片实例）和视觉语言模型（推理植物结构），无需额外训练即可提取植物个体。通过集成两种模型的优势，实现零样本的植物个体分割。

Result: 在包含多个植物物种、不同生长阶段和拍摄环境的数据集上评估显示，该方法超越了现有的零样本方法，并且在跨域性能上优于监督学习方法。

Conclusion: ZeroPlantSeg提供了一个有效的零样本解决方案，能够处理复杂的植物个体分割任务，具有良好的泛化能力和实用性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Foundation segmentation models achieve reasonable leaf instance extraction
from top-view crop images without training (i.e., zero-shot). However,
segmenting entire plant individuals with each consisting of multiple
overlapping leaves remains challenging. This problem is referred to as a
hierarchical segmentation task, typically requiring annotated training
datasets, which are often species-specific and require notable human labor. To
address this, we introduce ZeroPlantSeg, a zero-shot segmentation for
rosette-shaped plant individuals from top-view images. We integrate a
foundation segmentation model, extracting leaf instances, and a vision-language
model, reasoning about plants' structures to extract plant individuals without
additional training. Evaluations on datasets with multiple plant species,
growth stages, and shooting environments demonstrate that our method surpasses
existing zero-shot methods and achieves better cross-domain performance than
supervised methods. Implementations are available at

TL;DR: 本文通过数据构建和模型架构的协同改进，将CLIP应用于人员表征学习，提出了WebPerson数据集和GA-DMS框架，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在人员表征学习中面临两个关键挑战：缺乏大规模标注的人员中心视觉语言数据，以及全局对比学习难以保持细粒度匹配所需的判别性局部特征且易受噪声文本标记影响。

Method: 1) 开发基于MLLM上下文学习能力的抗噪声数据构建管道，自动筛选和标注网络图像，创建WebPerson数据集（500万高质量人员中心图像-文本对）；2) 提出GA-DMS框架，通过梯度注意力相似性评分自适应掩码噪声文本标记，并加入掩码标记预测目标以增强细粒度语义表征学习。

Result: 大量实验表明，GA-DMS在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过数据策展和模型架构的协同改进，成功将CLIP应用于人员表征学习，解决了数据稀缺和全局对比学习局限性问题，取得了优异性能。

Abstract: Although Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) exhibits strong
performance across diverse vision tasks, its application to person
representation learning faces two critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated vision-language data focused on person-centric images,
and (ii) the inherent limitations of global contrastive learning, which
struggles to maintain discriminative local features crucial for fine-grained
matching while remaining vulnerable to noisy text tokens. This work advances
CLIP for person representation learning through synergistic improvements in
data curation and model architecture. First, we develop a noise-resistant data
construction pipeline that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of
MLLMs to automatically filter and caption web-sourced images. This yields
WebPerson, a large-scale dataset of 5M high-quality person-centric image-text
pairs. Second, we introduce the GA-DMS (Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking
Synergetic) framework, which improves cross-modal alignment by adaptively
masking noisy textual tokens based on the gradient-attention similarity score.
Additionally, we incorporate masked token prediction objectives that compel the
model to predict informative text tokens, enhancing fine-grained semantic
representation learning. Extensive experiments show that GA-DMS achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALL-PET是一个低资源、低样本的PET投影域基础模型，通过潜在扩散模型和三项创新技术，仅用500个样本就能实现高质量sinogram生成，并在多种PET任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PET成像中标记数据有限和计算资源不足的问题，克服数据稀缺和效率限制，构建大规模基础模型。

Method: 使用潜在扩散模型(LDM)，包含三项关键技术：1) Radon掩码增强策略(RMAS)生成20万+多样化训练样本；2) 正负掩码约束确保几何一致性；3) 透明医学注意力(TMA)机制增强病灶相关区域。

Result: 仅用500个样本就实现了高质量的sinogram生成，性能可与大数据集训练的模型相媲美，内存使用低于24GB，在低剂量重建、衰减校正、延迟帧预测和示踪剂分离等任务中均表现良好。

Conclusion: ALL-PET成功解决了PET成像中的数据稀缺问题，提供了一个高效、灵活且可解释的基础模型框架，为医学影像分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Building large-scale foundation model for PET imaging is hindered by limited
access to labeled data and insufficient computational resources. To overcome
data scarcity and efficiency limitations, we propose ALL-PET, a low-resource,
low-shot PET foundation model operating directly in the projection domain.
ALL-PET leverages a latent diffusion model (LDM) with three key innovations.
First, we design a Radon mask augmentation strategy (RMAS) that generates over
200,000 structurally diverse training samples by projecting randomized
image-domain masks into sinogram space, significantly improving generalization
with minimal data. This is extended by a dynamic multi-mask (DMM) mechanism
that varies mask quantity and distribution, enhancing data diversity without
added model complexity. Second, we implement positive/negative mask constraints
to embed strict geometric consistency, reducing parameter burden while
preserving generation quality. Third, we introduce transparent medical
attention (TMA), a parameter-free, geometry-driven mechanism that enhances
lesion-related regions in raw projection data. Lesion-focused attention maps
are derived from coarse segmentation, covering both hypermetabolic and
hypometabolic areas, and projected into sinogram space for physically
consistent guidance. The system supports clinician-defined ROI adjustments,
ensuring flexible, interpretable, and task-adaptive emphasis aligned with PET
acquisition physics. Experimental results show ALL-PET achieves high-quality
sinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to
models trained on larger datasets. ALL-PET generalizes across tasks including
low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and
tracer separation, operating efficiently with memory use under 24GB.

Motivation: 比较持久同调(PH)和人工神经网络(ANN)在从数据推断拓扑结构方面的噪声鲁棒性，探索ANN作为PH替代方案的潜力

Method: 使用基于立方复形和符号欧几里得距离变换(SEDT)的PH流程与监督神经网络进行对比，在一个合成数据集和两个真实数据集上测试Betti数预测性能

Result: ANN在噪声条件下表现优于PH方法，显示出更好的噪声鲁棒性

Conclusion: 尽管仍处于发展阶段，但ANN为结构噪声下的拓扑估计提供了一个有吸引力的替代方案

Abstract: Persistent Homology (PH) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) offer
contrasting approaches to inferring topological structure from data. In this
study, we examine the noise robustness of a supervised neural network trained
to predict Betti numbers in 2D binary images. We compare an ANN approach
against a PH pipeline based on cubical complexes and the Signed Euclidean
Distance Transform (SEDT), which is a widely adopted strategy for noise-robust
topological analysis. Using one synthetic and two real-world datasets, we show
that ANNs can outperform this PH approach under noise, likely due to their
capacity to learn contextual and geometric priors from training data. Though
still emerging, the use of ANNs for topology estimation offers a compelling
alternative to PH under structural noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指标评估整体图像质量，与人类感知存在差异。受神经心理学启发，认为人类识别3D场景主要关注单个物体

Method: 利用物体检测模型及其特征表示来量化场景中每个物体的"物体性"，进行以物体为中心的评估

Result: 用户研究表明OSIM比现有指标更符合人类感知，并通过多种方法分析了OSIM的特性

Conclusion: OSIM为3D重建和生成模型提供了更准确的评估标准，有助于明确该领域的发展进展

Abstract: This paper presents Objectness SIMilarity (OSIM), a novel evaluation metric
for 3D scenes that explicitly focuses on "objects," which are fundamental units
of human visual perception. Existing metrics assess overall image quality,
leading to discrepancies with human perception. Inspired by neuropsychological
insights, we hypothesize that human recognition of 3D scenes fundamentally
involves attention to individual objects. OSIM enables object-centric
evaluations by leveraging an object detection model and its feature
representations to quantify the "objectness" of each object in the scene. Our
user study demonstrates that OSIM aligns more closely with human perception
compared to existing metrics. We also analyze the characteristics of OSIM using
various approaches. Moreover, we re-evaluate recent 3D reconstruction and
generation models under a standardized experimental setup to clarify
advancements in this field. The code is available at

Conclusion: 通过将数据集、归纳偏置和架构统一到协调框架中，本论文不仅提供了全面的回顾性分析，还为推进通用视频理解提供了预记性的发展路线图

Abstract: Video understanding has advanced rapidly, fueled by increasingly complex
datasets and powerful architectures. Yet existing surveys largely classify
models by task or family, overlooking the structural pressures through which
datasets guide architectural evolution. This survey is the first to adopt a
dataset-driven perspective, showing how motion complexity, temporal span,
hierarchical composition, and multimodal richness impose inductive biases that
models should encode. We reinterpret milestones, from two-stream and 3D CNNs to
sequential, transformer, and multimodal foundation models, as concrete
responses to these dataset-driven pressures. Building on this synthesis, we
offer practical guidance for aligning model design with dataset invariances
while balancing scalability and task demands. By unifying datasets, inductive
biases, and architectures into a coherent framework, this survey provides both
a comprehensive retrospective and a prescriptive roadmap for advancing
general-purpose video understanding.

Abstract: Pathologists routinely alternate between different magnifications when
examining Whole-Slide Images, allowing them to evaluate both broad tissue
morphology and intricate cellular details to form comprehensive diagnoses.
However, existing deep learning-based cell detection models struggle to
replicate these behaviors and learn the interdependent semantics between
structures at different magnifications. A key barrier in the field is the lack
of datasets with multi-scale overlapping cell and tissue annotations. The
OCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to
validate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue)
interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to
accelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes
overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs,
comprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
Whole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training,
validation, and test subsets. Participants presented models that significantly
enhanced the understanding of cell-tissue relationships. Top entries achieved
up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline
cell-only model that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships. This is a
substantial improvement in performance over traditional cell-only detection
methods, demonstrating the need for incorporating multi-scale semantics into
the models. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the methods used by
participants, highlighting innovative strategies implemented in the OCELOT 2023
challenge.

Abstract: Object detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery presents
significant challenges. Issues such as densely packed small objects, scale
variations, and occlusion are commonplace. This paper introduces RT-DETR++,
which enhances the encoder component of the RT-DETR model. Our improvements
focus on two key aspects. First, we introduce a channel-gated attention-based
upsampling/downsampling (AU/AD) mechanism. This dual-path system minimizes
errors and preserves details during feature layer propagation. Second, we
incorporate CSP-PAC during feature fusion. This technique employs parallel
hollow convolutions to process local and contextual information within the same
layer, facilitating the integration of multi-scale features. Evaluation
demonstrates that our novel neck design achieves superior performance in
detecting small and densely packed objects. The model maintains sufficient
speed for real-time detection without increasing computational complexity. This

Motivation: 现有KB-VQA方法直接使用检索到的知识，忽视了知识的冗余性和噪声问题，导致回答准确性下降。

Method: 首先从图像-问题对中提取关键部分构建低噪声查询，然后使用大模型识别和提取有益回答的知识段落，最后采用选择性知识整合策略，只在模型缺乏信心时才使用知识。

Result: 实验结果显示，该框架在知识基于视觉问答任务上超越了当前最优方法。

Conclusion: 通过知识聚焦和冗余消除，该无需训练框架能够获得更准确和关键的知识，提高了KB-VQA的性能。

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires a model to
understand images and utilize external knowledge to provide accurate answers.
Existing approaches often directly augment models with retrieved information
from knowledge sources while ignoring substantial knowledge redundancy, which
introduces noise into the answering process. To address this, we propose a
training-free framework with knowledge focusing for KB-VQA, that mitigates the
impact of noise by enhancing knowledge relevance and reducing redundancy.
First, for knowledge retrieval, our framework concludes essential parts from
the image-question pairs, creating low-noise queries that enhance the retrieval
of highly relevant knowledge. Considering that redundancy still persists in the
retrieved knowledge, we then prompt large models to identify and extract
answer-beneficial segments from knowledge. In addition, we introduce a
selective knowledge integration strategy, allowing the model to incorporate
knowledge only when it lacks confidence in answering the question, thereby
mitigating the influence of redundant information. Our framework enables the
acquisition of accurate and critical knowledge, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 高光谱遥感技术虽在林业生态和精准农业等领域有重要应用价值，但由于波段众多、维度高、光谱混合等特点导致特征冗余问题突出，需要更精细的地物分类方法。

Method: 使用ZY1F卫星高光谱图像数据，提出CWSSNet框架：集成3D光谱空间特征和小波卷积，采用多尺度卷积注意力模块融合多模态信息，引入小波域多波段分解和卷积操作。

Result: 在余干县实验中，CWSSNet在mIoU、mAcc和mF1上分别达到74.50%、82.73%和84.94%，在水体、植被和裸地分类中IoU最高，且在小样本训练条件下性能可靠。

Conclusion: CWSSNet框架突破了传统方法的分类性能瓶颈，具有良好的鲁棒性，在高光谱图像地物分类中表现出色，特别适用于小样本训练场景。

Abstract: Hyperspectral remote sensing technology has significant application value in
fields such as forestry ecology and precision agriculture, while also putting
forward higher requirements for fine ground object classification. However,
although hyperspectral images are rich in spectral information and can improve
recognition accuracy, they tend to cause prominent feature redundancy due to
their numerous bands, high dimensionality, and spectral mixing characteristics.
To address this, this study used hyperspectral images from the ZY1F satellite
as a data source and selected Yugan County, Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province as
the research area to perform ground object classification research. A
classification framework named CWSSNet was proposed, which integrates 3D
spectral-spatial features and wavelet convolution. This framework integrates
multimodal information us-ing a multiscale convolutional attention module and
breaks through the classification performance bottleneck of traditional methods
by introducing multi-band decomposition and convolution operations in the
wavelet domain. The experiments showed that CWSSNet achieved 74.50\%, 82.73\%,
and 84.94\% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), mean Accuracy (mAcc), and
mean F1-score (mF1) respectively in Yugan County. It also obtained the highest
Intersection over Union (IoU) in the classifica-tion of water bodies,
vegetation, and bare land, demonstrating good robustness. Additionally, when
the training set proportion was 70\%, the increase in training time was
limited, and the classification effect was close to the optimal level,
indicating that the model maintains reliable performance under small-sample
training conditions.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, highly realistic image

Although AI-generated image detection methods have partially addressed these
concerns, a substantial research gap remains in evaluating their performance
under complex real-world conditions. This paper introduces the Real-World
Robustness Dataset (RRDataset) for comprehensive evaluation of detection models
across three dimensions: 1) Scenario Generalization: RRDataset encompasses
high-quality images from seven major scenarios (War and Conflict, Disasters and
Accidents, Political and Social Events, Medical and Public Health, Culture and

gaps from a content perspective. 2) Internet Transmission Robustness: examining
detector performance on images that have undergone multiple rounds of sharing
across various social media platforms. 3) Re-digitization Robustness: assessing
model effectiveness on images altered through four distinct re-digitization
methods. We benchmarked 17 detectors and 10 vision-language models (VLMs) on
RRDataset and conducted a large-scale human study involving 192 participants to
investigate human few-shot learning capabilities in detecting AI-generated

methods under real-world conditions and underscore the importance of drawing on
human adaptability to develop more robust detection algorithms.

### [71] [Dark-ISP: Enhancing RAW Image Processing for Low-Light Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09183)
*Jiasheng Guo,Xin Gao,Yuxiang Yan,Guanghao Li,Jian Pu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量级的Dark-ISP插件，直接处理黑暗环境下的Bayer RAW图像，通过解构传统ISP流程为可微分模块，并使用自适应机制优化，在低光物体检测任务中达到了更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的低光物体检测方法或者使用有信息损失的RAW-RGB图像，或者采用复杂框架，需要一种轻量级且能够直接处理RAW图像的方案来提高检测性能。

Method: 将传统ISP流程解构为线性传感器校准和非线性音调映射子模块，重构为可微分组件，通过任务驱动损失优化。每个模块具备内容自适应性和物理信息先验知识，并使用自成增机制促进子模块合作。

Result: 在三个RAW图像数据集上的实验表明，该方法在具有挑战性的低光环境中，以最少的参数量超越了现有的RGB和RAW基于检测的方法。

Conclusion: Dark-ISP插件能够直接处理Bayer RAW图像，实现无缝端到端训练，通过解构ISP流程和自适应机制，在低光物体检测任务中取得了显著成效。

Abstract: Low-light Object detection is crucial for many real-world applications but
remains challenging due to degraded image quality. While recent studies have
shown that RAW images offer superior potential over RGB images, existing
approaches either use RAW-RGB images with information loss or employ complex
frameworks. To address these, we propose a lightweight and self-adaptive Image
Signal Processing (ISP) plugin, Dark-ISP, which directly processes Bayer RAW
images in dark environments, enabling seamless end-to-end training for object
detection. Our key innovations are: (1) We deconstruct conventional ISP
pipelines into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone
mapping) sub-modules, recasting them as differentiable components optimized
through task-driven losses. Each module is equipped with content-aware
adaptability and physics-informed priors, enabling automatic RAW-to-RGB
conversion aligned with detection objectives. (2) By exploiting the ISP
pipeline's intrinsic cascade structure, we devise a Self-Boost mechanism that
facilitates cooperation between sub-modules. Through extensive experiments on
three RAW image datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art RGB- and RAW-based detection approaches, achieving superior
results with minimal parameters in challenging low-light environments.

Motivation: 现有目标引导方法在粗粒度目标预测和细粒度轨迹补全之间存在中间粒度未被充分利用的问题，多粒度建模可以更好地捕捉人类动态和运动模式。

Conclusion: 多粒度目标引导框架通过递归精炼和特征整合，有效提升了人类轨迹预测的准确性，证明了中间粒度建模的重要价值。

Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for robotics navigation and
autonomous driving. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating goal
guidance significantly enhances prediction accuracy by reducing uncertainty and
leveraging prior knowledge. Most goal-guided approaches decouple the prediction
task into two stages: goal prediction and subsequent trajectory completion
based on the predicted goal, which operate at extreme granularities:
coarse-grained goal prediction forecasts the overall intention, while
fine-grained trajectory completion needs to generate the positions for all
future timesteps. The potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity
remains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory
modeling. While prior work has shown that multi-granularity representations
capture diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, effectively
integrating this concept into goal-guided frameworks remains challenging. In
this paper, we propose MGTraj, a novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for
human Trajectory prediction. MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals
from coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based
recursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive
refinements. Features across different granularities are integrated using a
weight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is employed as an auxiliary
task to further enhance performance. Comprehensive experimental results in
EHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset indicate that MGTraj outperforms baseline
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.

TL;DR: Medverse是一个通用的3D医学影像上下文学习模型，通过多尺度自回归框架和块状交叉注意力模块，在22个数据集上训练，实现了跨器官、模态和临床中心的高保真预测和全局解剖理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学影像的上下文学习模型无法同时实现高保真预测和全局解剖理解，且缺乏跨多种任务和解剖区域的统一模型，限制了上下文学习在医学影像中的潜力。

Method: 采用多尺度自回归上下文学习框架，从粗到细逐步优化预测；提出块状交叉注意力模块，在保持计算效率的同时实现上下文与目标输入的长程交互；在22个数据集上训练，涵盖多种器官、成像模态和临床中心。

Conclusion: Medverse展示了上下文学习在3D医学影像分析中的巨大潜力，为通用医学影像分析提供了有效的解决方案，代码和模型权重已公开。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) offers a promising paradigm for universal medical
image analysis, enabling models to perform diverse image processing tasks
without retraining. However, current ICL models for medical imaging remain
limited in two critical aspects: they cannot simultaneously achieve
high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no
unified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation
and enhancement) and anatomical regions. As a result, the full potential of ICL
in medical imaging remains underexplored. Thus, we present \textbf{Medverse}, a
universal ICL model for 3D medical imaging, trained on 22 datasets covering
diverse tasks in universal image segmentation, transformation, and enhancement
across multiple organs, imaging modalities, and clinical centers. Medverse
employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that
progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating consistent,
full-resolution volumetric outputs and enabling multi-scale anatomical
awareness. We further propose a blockwise cross-attention module that
facilitates long-range interactions between context and target inputs while
preserving computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Medverse is
extensively evaluated on a broad collection of held-out datasets covering
previously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities.
Results demonstrate that Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL
baselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning. Code and
model weights will be made publicly available. Our model are publicly available

Abstract: Background and objective Early diagnosis of gastric diseases is crucial to
prevent fatal outcomes. Although histopathologic examination remains the
diagnostic gold standard, it is performed entirely manually, making evaluations
labor-intensive and prone to variability among pathologists. Critical findings
may be missed, and lack of standard procedures reduces consistency. These
limitations highlight the need for automated, reliable, and efficient methods
for gastric tissue analysis. Methods In this study, a novel hybrid model named
CoAtNeXt was proposed for the classification of gastric tissue images. The
model is built upon the CoAtNet architecture by replacing its MBConv layers
with enhanced ConvNeXtV2 blocks. Additionally, the Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) is integrated to improve local feature extraction
through channel and spatial attention mechanisms. The architecture was scaled
to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and classification
performance. CoAtNeXt was evaluated on two publicly available datasets,
HMU-GC-HE-30K for eight-class classification and GasHisSDB for binary
classification, and was compared against 10 Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) and ten Vision Transformer (ViT) models. Results CoAtNeXt achieved
96.47% accuracy, 96.60% precision, 96.47% recall, 96.45% F1 score, and 99.89%
AUC on HMU-GC-HE-30K. On GasHisSDB, it reached 98.29% accuracy, 98.07%
precision, 98.41% recall, 98.23% F1 score, and 99.90% AUC. It outperformed all
CNN and ViT models tested and surpassed previous studies in the literature.
Conclusion Experimental results show that CoAtNeXt is a robust architecture for
histopathological classification of gastric tissue images, providing
performance on binary and multiclass. Its highlights its potential to assist
pathologists by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing workload.

Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在通用医疗任务上表现良好，但在牙科等专业领域的效果尚未充分探索。全景X射线图像由于解剖结构密集和病理线索细微，现有医疗基准无法充分评估模型在此类图像上的表现。

Method: 1) 构建MMOral大规模多模态指令数据集，包含20,563张标注图像和130万条指令实例；2) 开发MMOral-Bench评估套件，涵盖牙科5个关键诊断维度；3) 基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B进行监督微调，提出OralGPT模型。

Conclusion: MMOral数据集和OralGPT模型为智能牙科提供了重要基础，能够推动牙科领域更具临床影响力的多模态AI系统发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
strong performance on general-purpose medical tasks. However, their
effectiveness in specialized domains such as dentistry remains underexplored.
In particular, panoramic X-rays, a widely used imaging modality in oral
radiology, pose interpretative challenges due to dense anatomical structures
and subtle pathological cues, which are not captured by existing medical
benchmarks or instruction datasets. To this end, we introduce MMOral, the first
large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark tailored for panoramic
X-ray interpretation. MMOral consists of 20,563 annotated images paired with
1.3 million instruction-following instances across diverse task types,
including attribute extraction, report generation, visual question answering,
and image-grounded dialogue. In addition, we present MMOral-Bench, a
comprehensive evaluation suite covering five key diagnostic dimensions in
dentistry. We evaluate 64 LVLMs on MMOral-Bench and find that even the
best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, only achieves 41.45% accuracy, revealing
significant limitations of current models in this domain. To promote the
progress of this specific domain, we also propose OralGPT, which conducts
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our meticulously curated
MMOral instruction dataset. Remarkably, a single epoch of SFT yields
substantial performance enhancements for LVLMs, e.g., OralGPT demonstrates a
24.73% improvement. Both MMOral and OralGPT hold significant potential as a
critical foundation for intelligent dentistry and enable more clinically
impactful multimodal AI systems in the dental field. The dataset, model,
benchmark, and evaluation suite are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用均匀帧采样和隐式位置编码，难以处理长距离依赖关系，导致关键信息丢失和时间理解能力下降

Method: DATE方法包含时间戳注入机制(TIM)和时序感知相似性采样策略(TASS)，将视频帧嵌入与文本时间戳交错构建连续时间参考系统，并采用两阶段算法确保语义相关性和时间覆盖

Result: 在小时级长视频基准测试中，7B和72B模型均取得最先进性能，7B模型在某些基准上甚至超越了许多72B模型

Conclusion: DATE方法有效解决了长视频理解中的时间推理和事件定位问题，为多模态大语言模型的长视频处理提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Long video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), particularly in tasks requiring precise temporal
reasoning and event localization. Existing approaches typically adopt uniform
frame sampling and rely on implicit position encodings to model temporal order.
However, these methods struggle with long-range dependencies, leading to
critical information loss and degraded temporal comprehension. In this paper,
we propose Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) that enhances temporal
awareness in MLLMs through the Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and a
semantically guided Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy.
Specifically, we interleave video frame embeddings with textual timestamp
tokens to construct a continuous temporal reference system. We further
reformulate the video sampling problem as a vision-language retrieval task and
introduce a two-stage algorithm to ensure both semantic relevance and temporal
coverage: enriching each query into a descriptive caption to better align with
the vision feature, and sampling key event with a similarity-driven temporally
regularized greedy strategy. Our method achieves remarkable improvements w.r.t.
absolute time understanding and key event localization, resulting in
state-of-the-art performance among 7B and 72B models on hour-long video
benchmarks. Particularly, our 7B model even exceeds many 72B models on some
benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决3D医学图像分割资源消耗大、时间长的限制，以及现有静态模型难以在不同任务间平衡性能与效率的问题。

Method: 从冗余模型开始，通过块级剪枝和功能解耦损失迭代剪枝冗余模块，实现动态高效的3D分割。

Conclusion: PSP-Seg是一种成本效益高且性能优异的替代方案，具有广泛的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: 3D medical image segmentation often faces heavy resource and time
consumption, limiting its scalability and rapid deployment in clinical
environments. Existing efficient segmentation models are typically static and
manually designed prior to training, which restricts their adaptability across
diverse tasks and makes it difficult to balance performance with resource
efficiency. In this paper, we propose PSP-Seg, a progressive pruning framework
that enables dynamic and efficient 3D segmentation. PSP-Seg begins with a
redundant model and iteratively prunes redundant modules through a combination
of block-wise pruning and a functional decoupling loss. We evaluate PSP-Seg on
five public datasets, benchmarking it against seven state-of-the-art models and
six efficient segmentation models. Results demonstrate that the lightweight
variant, PSP-Seg-S, achieves performance on par with nnU-Net while reducing GPU
memory usage by 42-45%, training time by 29-48%, and parameter number by 83-87%
across all datasets. These findings underscore PSP-Seg's potential as a
cost-effective yet high-performing alternative for widespread clinical
application.

Motivation: 解决现有图表理解方法的局限性：外部工具依赖性强且弱动，专门模型仅采用单一的文本推理策略而中间步骤难以验证

Result: 在多样化的图表理解测试集上展现出强大且稳健的性能

Conclusion: VLMs不仅可以学习如何推理，还可以学习动态选择每个任务的最优推理路径

Abstract: Chart understanding presents a critical test to the reasoning capabilities of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior approaches face critical limitations: some
rely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined
toolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single
reasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate
steps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the
use of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address
this, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual
information of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is
that this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation
consistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is
unsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a
learnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved
with code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive
framework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct
visual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with
reinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a
data-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical
hallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each
strategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments
demonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding
benchmarks. Our work shows that VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also
how to reason, dynamically selecting the optimal reasoning pathway for each
task.

Conclusion: 通过简单的架构修改和图像增强策略，成功实现了对任意MRI模态组合的分割能力，具有很好的实用性和泛化性。

Abstract: Segmentation models are important tools for the detection and analysis of
lesions in brain MRI. Depending on the type of brain pathology that is imaged,
MRI scanners can acquire multiple, different image modalities (contrasts). Most
segmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities
and cannot effectively process new ones at inference. Some models generalize to
unseen modalities but may lose discriminative modality-specific information.
This work aims to develop a model that can perform inference on data that
contain image modalities unseen during training, previously seen modalities,
and heterogeneous combinations of both, thus allowing a user to utilize any
available imaging modalities. We demonstrate this is possible with a simple,
thus practical alteration to the U-net architecture, by integrating a
modality-agnostic input channel or pathway, alongside modality-specific input
channels. To train this modality-agnostic component, we develop an image
augmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities. Augmentations
differentially alter the appearance of pathological and healthy brain tissue to
create artificial contrasts between them while maintaining realistic anatomical
integrity. We evaluate the method using 8 MRI databases that include 5 types of
pathologies (stroke, tumours, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and
white matter hyperintensities) and 8 modalities (T1, T1+contrast, T2, PD, SWI,
DWI, ADC and FLAIR). The results demonstrate that the approach preserves the
ability to effectively process MRI modalities encountered during training,
while being able to process new, unseen modalities to improve its segmentation.

Abstract: Open-set detection is crucial for robust UAV autonomy in air-to-air object
detection under real-world conditions. Traditional closed-set detectors degrade
significantly under domain shifts and flight data corruption, posing risks to
safety-critical applications. We propose a novel, model-agnostic open-set
detection framework designed specifically for embedding-based detectors. The
method explicitly handles unknown object rejection while maintaining robustness
against corrupted flight data. It estimates semantic uncertainty via entropy
modeling in the embedding space and incorporates spectral normalization and
temperature scaling to enhance open-set discrimination. We validate our
approach on the challenging AOT aerial benchmark and through extensive
real-world flight tests. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent
improvements over baseline methods, achieving up to a 10\% relative AUROC gain
compared to standard YOLO-based detectors. Additionally, we show that
background rejection further strengthens robustness without compromising
detection accuracy, making our solution particularly well-suited for reliable
UAV perception in dynamic air-to-air environments.

Abstract: Materials characterization is fundamental to acquiring materials information,
revealing the processing-microstructure-property relationships that guide
material design and optimization. While multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have recently shown promise in generative and predictive tasks within
materials science, their capacity to understand real-world characterization

first benchmark for materials characterization image understanding, comprising
1,500 questions that demand expert-level domain expertise. MatCha encompasses
four key stages of materials research comprising 21 distinct tasks, each
designed to reflect authentic challenges faced by materials scientists. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on MatCha reveals a significant
performance gap compared to human experts. These models exhibit degradation
when addressing questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated

Result: 实验结果表明SlotSAR在SAR图像处理中达到最先进性能，相比现有OCL方法能更好地保留结构细节

Conclusion: 提出的SlotSAR框架通过多级特征融合和注意力机制，成功实现了SAR图像中目标与背景杂波的有效分离，无需掩码标注即可获得清晰的目标表示

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images contain not only targets of interest
but also complex background clutter, including terrain reflections and speckle
noise. In many cases, such clutter exhibits intensity and patterns that
resemble targets, leading models to extract entangled or spurious features.
Such behavior undermines the ability to form clear target representations,
regardless of the classifier. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
object-centric learning (OCL) framework, named SlotSAR, that disentangles
target representations from background clutter in SAR images without mask
annotations. SlotSAR first extracts high-level semantic features from SARATR-X
and low-level scattering features from the wavelet scattering network in order
to obtain complementary multi-level representations for robust target
characterization. We further present a multi-level slot attention module that
integrates these low- and high-level features to enhance slot-wise
representation distinctiveness, enabling effective OCL. Experimental results
demonstrate that SlotSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR imagery
by preserving structural details compared to existing OCL methods.

TL;DR: PHCP是一个无需联合训练的无监督域适应框架，通过推理时自训练适配器来解决异构协作感知问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中不同车辆的感知模型存在异构性，现有方法需要联合训练或预先存储所有可能合作者的模型，这在实践中不切实际

Method: 提出渐进式异构协作感知(PHCP)框架，将问题建模为少样本无监督域适应，在推理时通过自训练适配器动态对齐特征

Result: 在OPV2V数据集上的大量实验表明，PHCP在多种异构场景下都取得了强劲性能，仅使用少量未标注数据就能达到与全数据集训练的SOTA方法相当的性能

Conclusion: PHCP首次实现了在推理时直接处理异构协作感知问题，无需联合训练或预先存储模型，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables vehicles to overcome individual perception
limitations by sharing information, allowing them to see further and through
occlusions. In real-world scenarios, models on different vehicles are often
heterogeneous due to manufacturer variations. Existing methods for
heterogeneous collaborative perception address this challenge by fine-tuning
adapters or the entire network to bridge the domain gap. However, these methods
are impractical in real-world applications, as each new collaborator must
undergo joint training with the ego vehicle on a dataset before inference, or
the ego vehicle stores models for all potential collaborators in advance.
Therefore, we pose a new question: Can we tackle this challenge directly during
inference, eliminating the need for joint training? To answer this, we
introduce Progressive Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception (PHCP), a novel
framework that formulates the problem as few-shot unsupervised domain
adaptation. Unlike previous work, PHCP dynamically aligns features by
self-training an adapter during inference, eliminating the need for labeled
data and joint training. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V dataset demonstrate
that PHCP achieves strong performance across diverse heterogeneous scenarios.
Notably, PHCP achieves performance comparable to SOTA methods trained on the
entire dataset while using only a small amount of unlabeled data.

Conclusion: 语言和视觉在图像分类中具有互补性，通过简单的学习免费融合方法可以有效利用这种互补性来提高分类准确率。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot classification
through image-text alignment. Yet, their purely visual inference capabilities
remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
both language-guided and vision-only image classification with a diverse set of
dual-encoder VLMs, including both well-established and recent models such as
SigLIP 2 and RADIOv2.5. The performance is compared in a standard setup on the
ImageNet-1k validation set and its label-corrected variant. The key factors
affecting accuracy are analysed, including prompt design, class diversity, the
number of neighbours in k-NN, and reference set size. We show that language and
vision offer complementary strengths, with some classes favouring textual
prompts and others better handled by visual similarity. To exploit this
complementarity, we introduce a simple, learning-free fusion method based on
per-class precision that improves classification performance. The code is

Conclusion: 领域相关的预训练数据比大规模但不相关的数据更有效，特定程序数据的加入能显著提升性能，但领域不匹配的大规模数据反而可能导致性能下降

Abstract: Automated surgical skill assessment (SSA) is a central task in surgical
computer vision. Developing robust SSA models is challenging due to the
scarcity of skill annotations, which are time-consuming to produce and require
expert consensus. Few-shot learning (FSL) offers a scalable alternative
enabling model development with minimal supervision, though its success
critically depends on effective pre-training. While widely studied for several
surgical downstream tasks, pre-training has remained largely unexplored in SSA.
In this work, we formulate SSA as a few-shot task and investigate how
self-supervised pre-training strategies affect downstream few-shot SSA
performance. We annotate a publicly available robotic surgery dataset with
Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) scores, and evaluate
various pre-training sources across three few-shot settings. We quantify domain
similarity and analyze how domain gap and the inclusion of procedure-specific
data into pre-training influence transferability. Our results show that small
but domain-relevant datasets can outperform large scale, less aligned ones,
achieving accuracies of 60.16%, 66.03%, and 73.65% in the 1-, 2-, and 5-shot
settings, respectively. Moreover, incorporating procedure-specific data into
pre-training with a domain-relevant external dataset significantly boosts
downstream performance, with an average gain of +1.22% in accuracy and +2.28%
in F1-score; however, applying the same strategy with less similar but
large-scale sources can instead lead to performance degradation. Code and
models are available at https://github.com/anastadimi/ssa-fsl.

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a significant global concern, with human error,
particularly distracted and impaired driving, among the leading causes. This
study introduces a novel driver behavior classification system that uses
external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and
impairment. The proposed framework employs advanced computer vision
methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement
analysis, and lane position monitoring. The system identifies unsafe driving
behaviors such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by
implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation
algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this
vision-based approach enables behavioral analysis of non-connected vehicles.
Experimental evaluations on diverse video datasets demonstrate the framework's
reliability and adaptability across varying road and environmental conditions.

Abstract: The advancement of open-source text-to-image (T2I) models has been hindered
by the absence of large-scale, reasoning-focused datasets and comprehensive
evaluation benchmarks, resulting in a performance gap compared to leading
closed-source systems. To address this challenge, We introduce FLUX-Reason-6M

FLUX-Reason-6M is a massive dataset consisting of 6 million high-quality
FLUX-generated images and 20 million bilingual (English and Chinese)
descriptions specifically designed to teach complex reasoning. The image are
organized according to six key characteristics: Imagination, Entity, Text
rendering, Style, Affection, and Composition, and design explicit Generation
Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) to provide detailed breakdowns of image generation
steps. The whole data curation takes 15,000 A100 GPU days, providing the
community with a resource previously unattainable outside of large industrial
labs. PRISM-Bench offers a novel evaluation standard with seven distinct
tracks, including a formidable Long Text challenge using GCoT. Through
carefully designed prompts, it utilizes advanced vision-language models for
nuanced human-aligned assessment of prompt-image alignment and image
aesthetics. Our extensive evaluation of 19 leading models on PRISM-Bench

Abstract: This paper aims to recover the intrinsic reflectance layer and shading layer
given a single image. Though this intrinsic image decomposition problem has
been studied for decades, it remains a significant challenge in cases of
complex scenes, i.e. spatially-varying lighting effect and rich textures. In
this paper, we propose a novel method for handling severe lighting and rich
textures in intrinsic image decomposition, which enables to produce
high-quality intrinsic images for real-world images. Specifically, we observe
that previous learning-based methods tend to produce texture-less and
over-smoothing intrinsic images, which can be used to infer the lighting and
texture information given a RGB image. In this way, we design a texture-guided
regularization term and formulate the decomposition problem into an
optimization framework, to separate the material textures and lighting effect.
We demonstrate that combining the novel texture-aware prior can produce
superior results to existing approaches.

Abstract: We explore the connection between Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods and Denoising
Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for solving ill-posed inverse problems, with a
focus on single-pixel imaging. We begin by identifying key distinctions between
PnP and diffusion models-particularly in their denoising mechanisms and
sampling procedures. By decoupling the diffusion process into three
interpretable stages: denoising, data consistency enforcement, and sampling, we
provide a unified framework that integrates learned priors with physical
forward models in a principled manner. Building upon this insight, we propose a
hybrid data-consistency module that linearly combines multiple PnP-style
fidelity terms. This hybrid correction is applied directly to the denoised
estimate, improving measurement consistency without disrupting the diffusion
sampling trajectory. Experimental results on single-pixel imaging tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves better reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation poses severe threats to cerebral
function, thus necessitating monitoring for timely intervention. While lumbar
puncture is the gold standard for ICP measurement, its invasiveness and
associated risks drive the need for non-invasive alternatives. Optic nerve
sheath diameter (ONSD) has emerged as a promising biomarker, as elevated ICP
directly correlates with increased ONSD. However, current clinical practices
for ONSD measurement suffer from inconsistency in manual operation,
subjectivity in optimal view selection, and variability in thresholding,
limiting their reliability. To address these challenges, we introduce a fully
automatic two-stage framework for ICP grading, integrating keyframe
identification, ONSD measurement and clinical data. Specifically, the fundus
ultrasound video processing stage performs frame-level anatomical segmentation,
rule-based keyframe identification guided by an international consensus
statement, and precise ONSD measurement. The intracranial pressure grading
stage then fuses ONSD metrics with clinical features to enable the prediction
of ICP grades, thereby demonstrating an innovative blend of interpretable
ultrasound analysis and multi-source data integration for objective clinical
evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a
validation accuracy of $0.845 \pm 0.071$ (with standard deviation from
five-fold cross-validation) and an independent test accuracy of 0.786,
significantly outperforming conventional threshold-based method ($0.637 \pm
0.111$ validation accuracy, $0.429$ test accuracy). Through effectively
reducing operator variability and integrating multi-source information, our
framework establishes a reliable non-invasive approach for clinical ICP
evaluation, holding promise for improving patient management in acute
neurological conditions.

Motivation: 现有IC缺陷分割方法需要外部正常图像对比，而微电子式IC图像布局多样且对齐困难，导致方法脆弱。研究发现缺陷主要是局部的，而每张图像中仍包含丰富的可重复正常模式。

Method: 提出一种无监督框架：1）可学习正常信息提取器从测试图像中聚合代表性正常特征；2）一致性损失使得这些特征与正常区域关联；3）在这些特征引导下，解码器只重建正常内容；4）通过重建殊差进行缺陷分割；5）使用伪异常增幅稳定训练。

Conclusion: 该无监督IC缺陷分割框架能够有效地分离缺陷，无需外部正常数据支持，在多种IC制造过程中都表现出良好的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Modern Integrated-Circuit(IC) manufacturing introduces diverse, fine-grained
defects that depress yield and reliability. Most industrial defect segmentation
compares a test image against an external normal set, a strategy that is
brittle for IC imagery where layouts vary across products and accurate
alignment is difficult. We observe that defects are predominantly local, while
each image still contains rich, repeatable normal patterns. We therefore
propose an unsupervised IC defect segmentation framework that requires no
external normal support. A learnable normal-information extractor aggregates
representative normal features from the test image, and a coherence loss
enforces their association with normal regions. Guided by these features, a
decoder reconstructs only normal content; the reconstruction residual then
segments defects. Pseudo-anomaly augmentation further stabilizes training.
Experiments on datasets from three IC process stages show consistent
improvements over existing approaches and strong robustness to product
variability.

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise for clinical decision
support, yet their reliability under distribution shifts remains a major
concern for safe deployment. These models often learn task-agnostic
correlations due to variability in imaging protocols and free-text reports,
limiting their generalizability and increasing the risk of failure in
real-world settings. We propose DRiFt, a structured feature decoupling
framework that explicitly separates clinically relevant signals from
task-agnostic noise using parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) and learnable
prompt tokens. To enhance cross-modal alignment and reduce uncertainty, we
curate high-quality, clinically grounded image-text pairs by generating
captions for a diverse medical dataset. Our approach improves in-distribution
performance by +11.4% Top-1 accuracy and +3.3% Macro-F1 over prior prompt-based
methods, while maintaining strong robustness across unseen datasets. Ablation
studies reveal that disentangling task-relevant features and careful alignment
significantly enhance model generalization and reduce unpredictable behavior
under domain shift. These insights contribute toward building safer, more
trustworthy VLMs for clinical use. The code is available at

Abstract: As an influential information fusion and low-level vision technique, image
fusion integrates complementary information from source images to yield an
informative fused image. A few attempts have been made in recent years to
jointly realize image fusion and super-resolution. However, in real-world
applications such as military reconnaissance and long-range detection missions,
the target and background structures in multimodal images are easily corrupted,
with low resolution and weak semantic information, which leads to suboptimal
results in current fusion techniques. In response, we propose FS-Diff, a
semantic guidance and clarity-aware joint image fusion and super-resolution
method. FS-Diff unifies image fusion and super-resolution as a conditional
generation problem. It leverages semantic guidance from the proposed clarity
sensing mechanism for adaptive low-resolution perception and cross-modal
feature extraction. Specifically, we initialize the desired fused result as
pure Gaussian noise and introduce the bidirectional feature Mamba to extract
the global features of the multimodal images. Moreover, utilizing the source
images and semantics as conditions, we implement a random iterative denoising
process via a modified U-Net network. This network istrained for denoising at
multiple noise levels to produce high-resolution fusion results with
cross-modal features and abundant semantic information. We also construct a
powerful aerial view multiscene (AVMS) benchmark covering 600 pairs of images.
Extensive joint image fusion and super-resolution experiments on six public and
our AVMS datasets demonstrated that FS-Diff outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods at multiple magnifications and can recover richer details and semantics
in the fused images. The code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in image-level self-supervised learning (SSL) have made
significant progress, yet learning dense representations for patches remains
challenging. Mainstream methods encounter an over-dispersion phenomenon that
patches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream performance
on dense tasks. This work reveals that image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion
by involving implicit semantic concentration. Specifically, the non-strict
spatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns,
i.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure
inter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for
dense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data.
These observations motivate us to explore explicit semantic concentration for
dense SSL. First, to break the strict spatial alignment, we propose to distill
the patch correspondences. Facing noisy and imbalanced pseudo labels, we
propose a noise-tolerant ranking loss. The core idea is extending the Average
Precision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and
adaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled.
Second, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose
the object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space.
Specifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via

TL;DR: FlexiD-Fuse是一个基于扩散模型的医学图像融合网络，能够处理任意数量的输入模态，解决了现有方法只能处理固定数量模态输入的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像融合方法只能处理固定数量的模态输入（如双模态或三模态），无法直接处理变化数量的输入，这限制了其在临床环境中的应用。

Conclusion: FlexiD-Fuse能够端到端处理任意数量的输入模态，在多种图像融合任务中均表现出色，为临床诊断提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Different modalities of medical images provide unique physiological and
anatomical information for diseases. Multi-modal medical image fusion
integrates useful information from different complementary medical images with
different modalities, producing a fused image that comprehensively and
objectively reflects lesion characteristics to assist doctors in clinical
diagnosis. However, existing fusion methods can only handle a fixed number of
modality inputs, such as accepting only two-modal or tri-modal inputs, and
cannot directly process varying input quantities, which hinders their
application in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce
FlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate
flexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal
and tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse
transforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition
inputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion
process and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. By incorporating the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm into the diffusion sampling iteration
process, FlexiD-Fuse can generate high-quality fused images with cross-modal
information from source images, independently of the number of input images. We
compared the latest two and tri-modal medical image fusion methods, tested them
on Harvard datasets, and evaluated them using nine popular metrics. The
experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in
medical image fusion with varying inputs. Meanwhile, we conducted extensive
extension experiments on infrared-visible, multi-exposure, and multi-focus
image fusion tasks with arbitrary numbers, and compared them with the
perspective SOTA methods. The results of the extension experiments consistently
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

Motivation: 解决撒哈拉以南非洲地区高质量标注医学影像数据稀缺的问题，为资源受限的临床环境开发高效可部署的脑胶质瘤分割解决方案

Method: 采用3D注意力UNet架构，加入残差块增强，利用BraTS 2021数据集预训练权重进行迁移学习，在BraTS-Africa数据集上进行评估

Result: 在95例MRI数据上获得Dice分数：增强肿瘤0.76、坏死和非增强肿瘤核心0.80、周围非功能半球0.85，模型大小约90MB，单体积推理时间低于1分钟

Conclusion: 该模型在数据质量和数量有限的情况下仍表现出良好的泛化能力，具有在低资源环境中支持临床决策的潜力，有助于缩小全球健康AI公平性差距

Abstract: Gliomas are the most prevalent type of primary brain tumors, and their
accurate segmentation from MRI is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning,
and longitudinal monitoring. However, the scarcity of high-quality annotated
imaging data in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) poses a significant challenge for
deploying advanced segmentation models in clinical workflows. This study
introduces a robust and computationally efficient deep learning framework
tailored for resource-constrained settings. We leveraged a 3D Attention UNet
architecture augmented with residual blocks and enhanced through transfer
learning from pre-trained weights on the BraTS 2021 dataset. Our model was
evaluated on 95 MRI cases from the BraTS-Africa dataset, a benchmark for glioma
segmentation in SSA MRI data. Despite the limited data quality and quantity,
our approach achieved Dice scores of 0.76 for the Enhancing Tumor (ET), 0.80
for Necrotic and Non-Enhancing Tumor Core (NETC), and 0.85 for Surrounding
Non-Functional Hemisphere (SNFH). These results demonstrate the
generalizability of the proposed model and its potential to support clinical
decision making in low-resource settings. The compact architecture,
approximately 90 MB, and sub-minute per-volume inference time on consumer-grade
hardware further underscore its practicality for deployment in SSA health
systems. This work contributes toward closing the gap in equitable AI for
global health by empowering underserved regions with high-performing and
accessible medical imaging solutions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Deepfakes, synthetic media created using advanced AI techniques, have
intensified the spread of misinformation, particularly in politically sensitive
contexts. Existing deepfake detection datasets are often limited, relying on
outdated generation methods, low realism, or single-face imagery, restricting
the effectiveness for general synthetic image detection. By analyzing social
media posts, we identify multiple modalities through which deepfakes propagate
misinformation. Furthermore, our human perception study demonstrates that
recently developed proprietary models produce synthetic images increasingly
indistinguishable from real ones, complicating accurate identification by the
general public. Consequently, we present a comprehensive, politically-focused
dataset specifically crafted for benchmarking detection against modern
generative models. This dataset contains three million real images paired with
descriptive captions, which are used for generating 963k corresponding
high-quality synthetic images from a mix of proprietary and open-source models.
Recognizing the continual evolution of generative techniques, we introduce an
innovative crowdsourced adversarial platform, where participants are
incentivized to generate and submit challenging synthetic images. This ongoing
community-driven initiative ensures that deepfake detection methods remain
robust and adaptive, proactively safeguarding public discourse from
sophisticated misinformation threats.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过使用全身线性和角动量作为约束，提出了一种新的损失函数来链接局部运动与全局运动，提高人体运动生成的物理准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将局部运动和全局运动分开处理，但这两者并不独立，而是物理耦合的。现有模型往往无法准确捐描这种耦合关系，而从关节矩矫求解全局轨迹又过于复杂

Method: 使用全身线性动量和角动量作为约束来链接局部运动与全局运动，并提出一个新的损失项来强化生成的动量与真实数据中观测到的动量之间的一致性

Result: 采用该损失函数后，减少了脚滑和抖动，改善了平衡性，同时保持了运动恢复的准确性

Conclusion: 动量作为一种物理基础的约束，能够有效地链接局部关节行为与全局位移，为人体运动生成提供了更物理准确的方法

Abstract: Many studies decompose human motion into local motion in a frame attached to
the root joint and global motion of the root joint in the world frame, treating
them separately. However, these two components are not independent. Global
movement arises from interactions with the environment, which are, in turn,
driven by changes in the body configuration. Motion models often fail to
precisely capture this physical coupling between local and global dynamics,
while deriving global trajectories from joint torques and external forces is
computationally expensive and complex. To address these challenges, we propose
using whole-body linear and angular momentum as a constraint to link local
motion with global movement. Since momentum reflects the aggregate effect of
joint-level dynamics on the body's movement through space, it provides a
physically grounded way to relate local joint behavior to global displacement.
Building on this insight, we introduce a new loss term that enforces
consistency between the generated momentum profiles and those observed in
ground-truth data. Incorporating our loss reduces foot sliding and jitter,
improves balance, and preserves the accuracy of the recovered motion. Code and
data are available at the project page https://hlinhn.github.io/momentum_bmvc.

Motivation: 识别沪漫线条图像之间的区域对应关系是沪漫处理的基础任务，可以支持自动上色和中间帧生成等应用，但这个任务在无预先标签的实际场景中很少被研究。

Method: 将每张线条图分成补丁集合，使用Transformer框架学习图像内和图像间的补丁级相似性，然后通过边缘感知聚类和区域匹配算法将补丁级预测转换为一致的区域级对应关系。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到了高补丁级准确率（6.34%），并生成了一致的区域级对应关系。

Conclusion: 该方法为无预先标签的沪漫线条图区域对应预测提供了有效解决方案，在实际应用中具有很大潜力。

Abstract: Understanding region-wise correspondence between manga line art images is a
fundamental task in manga processing, enabling downstream applications such as
automatic line art colorization and in-between frame generation. However, this
task remains largely unexplored, especially in realistic scenarios without
pre-existing segmentation or annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel
and practical task: predicting region-wise correspondence between raw manga
line art images without any pre-existing labels or masks. To tackle this
problem, we divide each line art image into a set of patches and propose a
Transformer-based framework that learns patch-level similarities within and
across images. We then apply edge-aware clustering and a region matching
algorithm to convert patch-level predictions into coherent region-level
correspondences. To support training and evaluation, we develop an automatic
annotation pipeline and manually refine a subset of the data to construct
benchmark datasets. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves high patch-level accuracy (e.g., 96.34%) and generates
consistent region-level correspondences, highlighting its potential for
real-world manga applications.

Conclusion: SGDF和GDCN方法有效解决了多视图聚类中的低质量数据问题，提升了聚类性能

Abstract: In recent years, Multi-View Clustering (MVC) has been significantly advanced
under the influence of deep learning. By integrating heterogeneous data from
multiple views, MVC enhances clustering analysis, making multi-view fusion
critical to clustering performance. However, there is a problem of low-quality
data in multi-view fusion. This problem primarily arises from two reasons: 1)
Certain views are contaminated by noisy data. 2) Some views suffer from missing
data. This paper proposes a novel Stochastic Generative Diffusion Fusion (SGDF)
method to address this problem. SGDF leverages a multiple generative mechanism
for the multi-view feature of each sample. It is robust to low-quality data.
Building on SGDF, we further present the Generative Diffusion Contrastive
Network (GDCN). Extensive experiments show that GDCN achieves the
state-of-the-art results in deep MVC tasks. The source code is publicly

Motivation: 解决传统3D超声系统成本高、复杂的问题，同时充分利用深度学习从2D图像序列估计探头轨迹，而之前的方法要么忽略全局特征要么将其与局部特征紧密耦合，限制了模型的稳健性

Method: 提出DualTrack双编码器架构：局部编码器使用密集时空卷积捕获细粒度特征，全局编码器使用图像背链和时间注意力层嵌入高级解剖特征和长程依赖，通过轻量融合模块结合两者特征来估计轨迹

Result: 在大型公开标准数据集上达到了最高准确度，超越了之前的方法，平均重建误差低于5mm，实现了全局一致的3D重建

Conclusion: DualTrack通过解耦局部和全局特征提取，有效地结合了两种互补特征的优势，为无传感器3D超声扫描提供了一种简单、低成本但高准确的解决方案

Abstract: Three-dimensional ultrasound (US) offers many clinical advantages over
conventional 2D imaging, yet its widespread adoption is limited by the cost and
complexity of traditional 3D systems. Sensorless 3D US, which uses deep
learning to estimate a 3D probe trajectory from a sequence of 2D US images, is
a promising alternative. Local features, such as speckle patterns, can help
predict frame-to-frame motion, while global features, such as coarse shapes and
anatomical structures, can situate the scan relative to anatomy and help
predict its general shape. In prior approaches, global features are either
ignored or tightly coupled with local feature extraction, restricting the
ability to robustly model these two complementary aspects. We propose
DualTrack, a novel dual-encoder architecture that leverages decoupled local and
global encoders specialized for their respective scales of feature extraction.
The local encoder uses dense spatiotemporal convolutions to capture
fine-grained features, while the global encoder utilizes an image backbone
(e.g., a 2D CNN or foundation model) and temporal attention layers to embed
high-level anatomical features and long-range dependencies. A lightweight
fusion module then combines these features to estimate the trajectory.
Experimental results on a large public benchmark show that DualTrack achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and globally consistent 3D reconstructions,
outperforming previous methods and yielding an average reconstruction error
below 5 mm.

Abstract: Video diffusion models have advanced rapidly in the recent years as a result
of series of architectural innovations (e.g., diffusion transformers) and use
of novel training objectives (e.g., flow matching). In contrast, less attention
has been paid to improving the feature representation power of such models. In
this work, we show that training video diffusion models can benefit from
aligning the intermediate features of the video generator with feature
representations of pre-trained vision encoders. We propose a new metric and
conduct an in-depth analysis of various vision encoders to evaluate their
discriminability and temporal consistency, thereby assessing their suitability
for video feature alignment. Based on the analysis, we present Align4Gen which
provides a novel multi-feature fusion and alignment method integrated into
video diffusion model training. We evaluate Align4Gen both for unconditional
and class-conditional video generation tasks and show that it results in
improved video generation as quantified by various metrics. Full video results

Motivation: 深度学习算法在MRI脑成像疾病诊断中可能存在捷径学习问题，即使用与输出标签无关的虚假特征进行预测。当这些特征与受保护属性相关时，会导致对代表性不足群体的性能偏见。

Method: 研究首先验证DL算法是否能从3D脑MRI扫描中识别种族或性别，然后调查训练集不平衡是否导致模型性能下降，最后对受保护属性和AD分类任务进行定量和定性的特征归因分析。使用ResNet和SwinTransformer等多种DL模型和数据集。

Result: 实验证明基于深度学习的AD分类中存在种族和性别相关的捷径学习和偏见。

Conclusion: 该工作为开发更公平的脑MRI深度学习诊断工具奠定了基础，提供了相关代码供进一步研究。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for brain imaging. Deep
learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to aid in the diagnosis of diseases
such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI scans. However, DL algorithms can
suffer from shortcut learning, in which spurious features, not directly related
to the output label, are used for prediction. When these features are related
to protected attributes, they can lead to performance bias against
underrepresented protected groups, such as those defined by race and sex. In
this work, we explore the potential for shortcut learning and demographic bias
in DL based AD diagnosis from MRI. We first investigate if DL algorithms can
identify race or sex from 3D brain MRI scans to establish the presence or
otherwise of race and sex based distributional shifts. Next, we investigate
whether training set imbalance by race or sex can cause a drop in model
performance, indicating shortcut learning and bias. Finally, we conduct a
quantitative and qualitative analysis of feature attributions in different
brain regions for both the protected attribute and AD classification tasks.
Through these experiments, and using multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet
and SwinTransformer), we demonstrate the existence of both race and sex based
shortcut learning and bias in DL based AD classification. Our work lays the
foundation for fairer DL diagnostic tools in brain MRI. The code is provided at

Abstract: To tackle the prevalence of pseudo changes, the scarcity of labeled samples,
and the difficulty of cross-domain generalization in multi-temporal and
multi-source remote sensing imagery, we propose PeftCD, a change detection
framework built upon Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT). At its core, PeftCD employs a weight-sharing Siamese
encoder derived from a VFM, into which LoRA and Adapter modules are seamlessly
integrated. This design enables highly efficient task adaptation by training
only a minimal set of additional parameters. To fully unlock the potential of
VFMs, we investigate two leading backbones: the Segment Anything Model v2
(SAM2), renowned for its strong segmentation priors, and DINOv3, a
state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learner. The framework is
complemented by a deliberately lightweight decoder, ensuring the focus remains
on the powerful feature representations from the backbones. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PeftCD achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple public datasets, including SYSU-CD (IoU 73.81%), WHUCD
(92.05%), MSRSCD (64.07%), MLCD (76.89%), CDD (97.01%), S2Looking (52.25%) and
LEVIR-CD (85.62%), with notably precise boundary delineation and strong
suppression of pseudo-changes. In summary, PeftCD presents an optimal balance
of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. It offers a powerful and scalable
paradigm for adapting large-scale VFMs to real-world remote sensing change
detection applications. The code and pretrained models will be released at

Abstract: Event cameras capture changes in brightness with microsecond precision and
remain reliable under motion blur and challenging illumination, offering clear
advantages for modeling highly dynamic scenes. Yet, their integration with
natural language understanding has received little attention, leaving a gap in
multimodal perception. To address this, we introduce Talk2Event, the first
large-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding using event data.
Built on real-world driving scenarios, Talk2Event comprises 5,567 scenes,

expressions. Each expression is enriched with four structured attributes --
appearance, status, relation to the viewer, and relation to surrounding objects
-- that explicitly capture spatial, temporal, and relational cues. This
attribute-centric design supports interpretable and compositional grounding,
enabling analysis that moves beyond simple object recognition to contextual
reasoning in dynamic environments. We envision Talk2Event as a foundation for
advancing multimodal and temporally-aware perception, with applications
spanning robotics, human-AI interaction, and so on.

Conclusion: Kling-Avatar为语义基础的高保真音频驱动头像合成设立了新的基准，适用于数字人直播和视频博客等实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven avatar video generation have significantly
enhanced audio-visual realism. However, existing methods treat instruction
conditioning merely as low-level tracking driven by acoustic or visual cues,
without modeling the communicative purpose conveyed by the instructions. This
limitation compromises their narrative coherence and character expressiveness.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that
unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait
generation. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we
design a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a
blueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing
high-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second
stage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in
parallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework
preserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent
behind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and
stable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world
applications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To
comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated
samples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Kling-Avatar is capable of generating vivid,
fluent, long-duration videos at up to 1080p and 48 fps, achieving superior

Abstract: Predicting the spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is essential for
guiding clinical decisions in neuro-oncology. We propose a hybrid mechanistic
learning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a
guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically
feasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as
a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics
including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These
estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that
aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on
the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices
of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our
framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity
metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both
clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image
generation in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time
predictions that account for mechanistic priors.

Method: 基于全景场景图数据集，利用细粒度场景图注释提取真实实体和关系，使用GPT-4-Turbo生成多选题，并经过严格的人工筛选过程，每个问题都包含"以上都不是"选项。

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) -- where the model
generates content inconsistent with the input image -- pose significant risks
in real-world applications, from misinformation in visual question answering to
unsafe errors in decision-making. Existing benchmarks primarily test
recognition accuracy, i.e., evaluating whether models can select the correct
answer among distractors. This overlooks an equally critical capability for
trustworthy AI: recognizing when none of the provided options are correct, a
behavior reflecting epistemic humility. We present HumbleBench, a new
hallucination benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' ability to reject plausible
but incorrect answers across three hallucination types: object, relation, and
attribute. Built from a panoptic scene graph dataset, we leverage fine-grained
scene graph annotations to extract ground-truth entities and relations, and
prompt GPT-4-Turbo to generate multiple-choice questions, followed by a
rigorous manual filtering process. Each question includes a "None of the above"
option, requiring models not only to recognize correct visual information but
also to identify when no provided answer is valid. We evaluate a variety of
state-of-the-art MLLMs -- including both general-purpose and specialized
reasoning models -- on HumbleBench and share valuable findings and insights
with the community. By incorporating explicit false-option rejection,
HumbleBench fills a key gap in current evaluation suites, providing a more
realistic measure of MLLM reliability in safety-critical settings. Our code and
dataset are released publicly and can be accessed at

Motivation: 通过理解和生成任务的双向信息流动，实现多模态学习的统一化，促进视觉理解和图像生成能力的相互提升

Method: 1）使用大规模长上下文图像描述进行解码器预训练 2）提出Unified-GRPO强化学习方法，包括冷启动、生成促进理解、理解促进生成三个阶段 3）构建Unified-Bench评估框架

Result: 强化学习过程中，编码器自主生成更描述性的文本描述，解码器能够理解这些复杂描述并生成高保真度的图像重建

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种统一多模态学习的新范式，通过理解与生成任务的双向协同训练，实现了视觉理解和图像生成能力的显著提升

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an insightful paradigm through the Auto-Encoder
lens-understanding as the encoder (I2T) that compresses images into text, and
generation as the decoder (T2I) that reconstructs images from that text. Using
reconstruction fidelity as the unified training objective, we enforce the
coherent bidirectional information flow between the understanding and
generation processes, bringing mutual gains. To implement this, we propose UAE,
a novel framework for unified multimodal learning. We begin by pre-training the
decoder with large-scale long-context image captions to capture fine-grained
semantic and complex spatial relationships. We then propose Unified-GRPO via
reinforcement learning (RL), which covers three stages: (1) A cold-start phase
to gently initialize both encoder and decoder with a semantic reconstruction
loss; (2) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to
generate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction
quality, enhancing its visual understanding; (3) Understanding for Generation,
where the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to
leverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and
generation fidelity. For evaluation, we introduce Unified-Bench, the first
benchmark tailored to assess the degree of unification of the UMMs. A
surprising "aha moment" arises within the multimodal learning domain: as RL
progresses, the encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions, while
the decoder simultaneously demonstrates a profound ability to understand these
intricate descriptions, resulting in reconstructions of striking fidelity.

Motivation: 现有基于VAE或扩散的方法无法充分建模人体运动的几何约束和物理合理性，需要一种能够尊重关节几何结构并保证运动物理合理性的新方法。

Method: 在关节旋转、角速度和角加速度的乘积空间上构建神经距离场，提出自适应步长混合算法进行投影，并使用几何积分器生成运动轨迹。

Result: 在AMASS数据集上训练后，NRMF在去噪、运动插值和部分2D/3D观测拟合等多个任务上表现出显著且一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: NRMF通过几何感知的神经距离场方法，为3D人体运动恢复提供了更鲁棒和物理合理的解决方案，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce Neural Riemannian Motion Fields (NRMF), a novel 3D generative
human motion prior that enables robust, temporally consistent, and physically
plausible 3D motion recovery. Unlike existing VAE or diffusion-based methods,
our higher-order motion prior explicitly models the human motion in the zero
level set of a collection of neural distance fields (NDFs) corresponding to
pose, transition (velocity), and acceleration dynamics. Our framework is
rigorous in the sense that our NDFs are constructed on the product space of
joint rotations, their angular velocities, and angular accelerations,
respecting the geometry of the underlying articulations. We further introduce:
(i) a novel adaptive-step hybrid algorithm for projecting onto the set of
plausible motions, and (ii) a novel geometric integrator to "roll out"
realistic motion trajectories during test-time-optimization and generation. Our
experiments show significant and consistent gains: trained on the AMASS
dataset, NRMF remarkably generalizes across multiple input modalities and to
diverse tasks ranging from denoising to motion in-betweening and fitting to
partial 2D / 3D observations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究认为深度扩散模型与最优去噪器之间的性能差距源于卷积网络的平移等变性和局部性归纳偏置，但本文旨在验证局部性实际上是图像数据集本身的统计特性。

Method: 通过分析最优参数化线性去噪器，证明其具有与深度神经去噪器相似的局部性特征；从理论和实验两方面验证这种局部性源于自然图像数据中的像素相关性；基于这些发现构建改进的解析去噪器。

Result: 实验表明最优参数化线性去噪器确实表现出与深度神经去噪器相似的局部性；理论分析证实这种局部性直接来源于自然图像数据集的像素相关性；新构建的解析去噪器比现有专家设计的替代方案更能匹配深度扩散模型的预测分数。

Conclusion: 扩散模型中的局部性主要源于图像数据集的统计特性而非网络架构的归纳偏置，这一发现为理解扩散模型行为提供了新视角，并有助于构建更准确的解析模型。

Abstract: Among generative models, diffusion models are uniquely intriguing due to the
existence of a closed-form optimal minimizer of their training objective, often
referred to as the optimal denoiser. However, diffusion using this optimal
denoiser merely reproduces images in the training set and hence fails to
capture the behavior of deep diffusion models. Recent work has attempted to
characterize this gap between the optimal denoiser and deep diffusion models,
proposing analytical, training-free models that can generate images that
resemble those generated by a trained UNet. The best-performing method
hypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of
convolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence
incorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we
present evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a
statistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of
convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal
parametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to the deep
neural denoisers. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that
this locality arises directly from the pixel correlations present in natural
image datasets. Finally, we use these insights to craft an analytical denoiser
that better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than the prior
expert-crafted alternative.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in spatial intelligence, spanning both
spatial reconstruction and world exploration. However, the scalability and
real-world fidelity of current models remain severely constrained by the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. While several datasets
provide camera pose information, they are typically limited in scale,
diversity, and annotation richness, particularly for real-world dynamic scenes
with ground-truth camera motion. To this end, we collect \textbf{SpatialVID}, a
dataset consists of a large corpus of in-the-wild videos with diverse scenes,
camera movements and dense 3D annotations such as per-frame camera poses,
depth, and motion instructions. Specifically, we collect more than 21,000 hours
of raw video, and process them into 2.7 million clips through a hierarchical
filtering pipeline, totaling 7,089 hours of dynamic content. A subsequent
annotation pipeline enriches these clips with detailed spatial and semantic
information, including camera poses, depth maps, dynamic masks, structured
captions, and serialized motion instructions. Analysis of SpatialVID's data
statistics reveals a richness and diversity that directly foster improved model
generalization and performance, establishing it as a key asset for the video
and 3D vision research community.

Conclusion: 该方法为处理现实世界中的不确定性提供了更实用的贝叶斯推断框架，扩展了计算语言学中区间编码的应用范围。

Abstract: Bayesian inference is widely used in many different fields to test hypotheses
against observations. In most such applications, an assumption is made of
precise input values to produce a precise output value. However, this is
unrealistic for real-world applications. Often the best available information
from subject matter experts (SMEs) in a given field is interval range estimates
of the input probabilities involved in Bayes Theorem. This paper provides two
key contributions to extend Bayes Theorem to an interval type-2 (IT2) version.
First, we develop an IT2 version of Bayes Theorem that uses a novel and
conservative method to avoid potential inconsistencies in the input IT2 MFs
that otherwise might produce invalid output results. We then describe a novel
and flexible algorithm for encoding SME-provided intervals into IT2 fuzzy
membership functions (MFs), which we can use to specify the input probabilities
in Bayes Theorem. Our algorithm generalizes and extends previous work on this
problem that primarily addressed the encoding of intervals into word MFs for
Computing with Words applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for automated game template generation
by transforming Game Design Documents (GDDs) into functional Unity game
prototypes using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and multi-modal Large

code that implements the core mechanics, systems, and architecture defined in
the design documentation. Our approach combines a fine-tuned LLaMA-3 model
specialized for Unity code generation with a custom Unity integration package
that streamlines the implementation process. Evaluation results demonstrate
significant improvements over baseline models, with our fine-tuned model
achieving superior performance (4.8/5.0 average score) compared to
state-of-the-art LLMs across compilation success, GDD adherence, best practices
adoption, and code modularity metrics. The generated templates demonstrate high
adherence to GDD specifications across multiple game genres. Our system
effectively addresses critical gaps in AI-assisted game development,
positioning LLMs as valuable tools in streamlining the transition from game

Conclusion: 该框架展示了多智能体分工在复杂建模任务中的有效性，并提出了未来改进路线图。

Abstract: Natural language descriptions of optimization or satisfaction problems are
challenging to translate into correct MiniZinc models, as this process demands
both logical reasoning and constraint programming expertise. We introduce a
framework that addresses this challenge with an agentic approach: multiple
specialized large language model (LLM) agents decompose the modeling task by
global constraint type. Each agent is dedicated to detecting and generating
code for a specific class of global constraint, while a final assembler agent
integrates these constraint snippets into a complete MiniZinc model. By
dividing the problem into smaller, well-defined sub-tasks, each LLM handles a
simpler reasoning challenge, potentially reducing overall complexity. We
conduct initial experiments with several LLMs and show better performance
against baselines such as one-shot prompting and chain-of-thought prompting.
Finally, we outline a comprehensive roadmap for future work, highlighting
potential enhancements and directions for improvement.

Conclusion: 损失函数设计为在合成数据时代保持生成模型质量提供了简单而强大的工具，置信度感知方法能有效缓解模型崩溃问题。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on generative AI models has accelerated the
generation rate of synthetic data, with some projections suggesting that most
available new data for training could be machine-generated by 2030. This shift
to a mainly synthetic content presents a critical challenge: repeated training
in synthetic data leads to a phenomenon known as model collapse, where model
performance degrades over generations of training, eventually rendering the
models ineffective. Although prior studies have explored the causes and
detection of model collapse, existing mitigation strategies remain limited.
  In this paper, we identify model overconfidence in their self-generated data
as a key driver of collapse. Building on this observation, we propose a
confidence-aware loss function that downweights high-confidence predictions
during training. We introduce a novel loss function we call Truncated Cross
Entropy (TCE). We demonstrate that TCE significantly delays model collapse in
recursive training.
  We provide a model-agnostic framework that links the loss function design to
model collapse mitigation and validate our approach both theoretically and
empirically, showing that it can extend the model's fidelity interval before
collapse by more than 2.3x. Finally, we show that our method generalizes across
modalities. These findings suggest that the design of loss functions provides a
simple yet powerful tool for preserving the quality of generative models in the
era of increasing synthetic data.

Abstract: Explainable AI has become a common term in the literature, scrutinized by
computer scientists and statisticians and highlighted by psychological or
philosophical researchers. One major effort many researchers tackle is
constructing general guidelines for XAI schemes, which we derived from our
study. While some areas of XAI are well studied, we focus on uncertainty
explanations and consider global explanations, which are often left out. We
chose an algorithm that covers various concepts simultaneously, such as
uncertainty, robustness, and global XAI, and tested its ability to calibrate
trust. We then checked whether an algorithm that aims to provide more of an
intuitive visual understanding, despite being complicated to understand, can
provide higher user satisfaction and human interpretability.

Motivation: 冷启动用户问题限制了推荐系统的有效性，因为缺乏历史行为信息。需要一种在低数据设置下有效的方法来提升LLM在推荐任务中的性能。

Method: 提出了上下文条件提示公式P(u, Ds)→R̂，其中u是冷启动用户档案，Ds是精选支持集。使用基于transformer的自回归LLM（BioGPT、LLaMA-2、GPT-4），通过token级对齐和嵌入空间正则化来优化提示结构。

Result: 实验证明最优的样本注入和指令结构可以显著提高precision@k和NDCG分数，特别是在低数据设置下。提示的及时组合不仅影响语法结构，还直接控制注意力规模和推理过程中的解码器行为。

Conclusion: 基于提示的适应方法可以作为解决LLM推荐管道中冷启动问题的一种有效途径，展示了语义保真度的重要性。

Abstract: The cold-start user issue further compromises the effectiveness of
recommender systems in limiting access to the historical behavioral
information. It is an effective pipeline to optimize instructional prompts on a
few-shot large language model (LLM) used in recommender tasks. We introduce a
context-conditioned prompt formulation method P(u,\ Ds)\ \rightarrow\
R\widehat, where u is a cold-start user profile, Ds is a curated support set,
and R\widehat is the predicted ranked list of items. Based on systematic
experimentation with transformer-based autoregressive LLMs (BioGPT, LLaMA-2,
GPT-4), we provide empirical evidence that optimal exemplar injection and
instruction structuring can significantly improve the precision@k and NDCG
scores of such models in low-data settings. The pipeline uses token-level
alignments and embedding space regularization with a greater semantic fidelity.
Our findings not only show that timely composition is not merely syntactic but
also functional as it is in direct control of attention scales and decoder
conduct through inference. This paper shows that prompt-based adaptation may be
considered one of the ways to address cold-start recommendation issues in
LLM-based pipelines.

Abstract: Coordination tasks traditionally performed by humans are increasingly being
delegated to autonomous agents. As this pattern progresses, it becomes critical
to evaluate not only these agents' performance but also the processes through
which they negotiate in dynamic, multi-agent environments. Furthermore,
different agents exhibit distinct advantages: traditional statistical agents,
such as Bayesian models, may excel under well-specified conditions, whereas
large language models (LLMs) can generalize across contexts. In this work, we
compare humans (N = 216), LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and Bayesian agents in
a dynamic negotiation setting that enables direct, identical-condition
comparisons across populations, capturing both outcomes and behavioral
dynamics. Bayesian agents extract the highest surplus through aggressive
optimization, at the cost of frequent trade rejections. Humans and LLMs can
achieve similar overall surplus, but through distinct behaviors: LLMs favor
conservative, concessionary trades with few rejections, while humans employ
more strategic, risk-taking, and fairness-oriented behaviors. Thus, we find
that performance parity -- a common benchmark in agent evaluation -- can
conceal fundamental differences in process and alignment, which are critical
for practical deployment in real-world coordination tasks.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于神经科学原理的计算框架，用于提升人工智能系统的空间智能和理解能力，以缩小与人类空间智能的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic AI have led to systems capable of autonomous task
execution and language-based reasoning, yet their spatial reasoning abilities
remain limited and underexplored, largely constrained to symbolic and
sequential processing. In contrast, human spatial intelligence, rooted in
integrated multisensory perception, spatial memory, and cognitive maps, enables
flexible, context-aware decision-making in unstructured environments.
Therefore, bridging this gap is critical for advancing Agentic Spatial
Intelligence toward better interaction with the physical 3D world. To this end,
we first start from scrutinizing the spatial neural models as studied in
computational neuroscience, and accordingly introduce a novel computational
framework grounded in neuroscience principles. This framework maps core
biological functions to six essential computation modules: bio-inspired
multimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric
conversion, an artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning.
Together, these modules form a perspective landscape for agentic spatial
reasoning capability across both virtual and physical environments. On top, we
conduct a framework-guided analysis of recent methods, evaluating their
relevance to each module and identifying critical gaps that hinder the
development of more neuroscience-grounded spatial reasoning modules. We further
examine emerging benchmarks and datasets and explore potential application
domains ranging from virtual to embodied systems, such as robotics. Finally, we
outline potential research directions, emphasizing the promising roadmap that
can generalize spatial reasoning across dynamic or unstructured environments.
We hope this work will benefit the research community with a
neuroscience-grounded perspective and a structured pathway. Our project page

Result: 在INTERACTION多智能体预测基准排名第一，在Argoverse 2多世界预测基准达到最先进性能

Conclusion: ProgD方法通过显式建模交互演化过程，显著提升了多智能体运动预测的准确性和一致性

Abstract: Accurate motion prediction of surrounding agents is crucial for the safe
planning of autonomous vehicles. Recent advancements have extended prediction
techniques from individual agents to joint predictions of multiple interacting
agents, with various strategies to address complex interactions within future
motions of agents. However, these methods overlook the evolving nature of these
interactions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel progressive
multi-scale decoding strategy, termed ProgD, with the help of dynamic
heterogeneous graph-based scenario modeling. In particular, to explicitly and
comprehensively capture the evolving social interactions in future scenarios,
given their inherent uncertainty, we design a progressive modeling of scenarios
with dynamic heterogeneous graphs. With the unfolding of such dynamic
heterogeneous graphs, a factorized architecture is designed to process the
spatio-temporal dependencies within future scenarios and progressively
eliminate uncertainty in future motions of multiple agents. Furthermore, a
multi-scale decoding procedure is incorporated to improve on the future
scenario modeling and consistent prediction of agents' future motion. The
proposed ProgD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION
multi-agent prediction benchmark, ranking $1^{st}$, and the Argoverse 2
multi-world forecasting benchmark.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-empowered autonomous agents are transforming
both digital and physical environments by enabling adaptive, multi-agent
collaboration. While these agents offer significant opportunities across
domains such as finance, healthcare, and smart manufacturing, their
unpredictable behaviors and heterogeneous capabilities pose substantial
governance and accountability challenges. In this paper, we propose a
blockchain-enabled layered architecture for regulatory agent collaboration,
comprising an agent layer, a blockchain data layer, and a regulatory
application layer. Within this framework, we design three key modules: (i) an
agent behavior tracing and arbitration module for automated accountability,
(ii) a dynamic reputation evaluation module for trust assessment in
collaborative scenarios, and (iii) a malicious behavior forecasting module for
early detection of adversarial activities. Our approach establishes a
systematic foundation for trustworthy, resilient, and scalable regulatory
mechanisms in large-scale agent ecosystems. Finally, we discuss the future
research directions for blockchain-enabled regulatory frameworks in multi-agent
systems.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了多步推理和工具使用能力，在多样化多步推理任务中展现出更好的泛化性能和更强的工具使用推理能力

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data
science workflows, but existing models still struggle with multi-step reasoning
and tool use, which limits their effectiveness on complex data analysis tasks.
To address this, we propose a scalable pipeline that extracts high-quality,
tool-based data analysis tasks and their executable multi-step solutions from
real-world Jupyter notebooks and associated data files. Using this pipeline, we
introduce NbQA, a large-scale dataset of standardized task-solution pairs that
reflect authentic tool-use patterns in practical data science scenarios. To
further enhance multi-step reasoning, we present Jupiter, a framework that
formulates data analysis as a search problem and applies Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to generate diverse solution trajectories for value model
learning. During inference, Jupiter combines the value model and node visit
counts to efficiently collect executable multi-step plans with minimal search
steps. Experimental results show that Qwen2.5-7B and 14B-Instruct models on
NbQA solve 77.82% and 86.38% of tasks on InfiAgent-DABench,
respectively-matching or surpassing GPT-4o and advanced agent frameworks.
Further evaluations demonstrate improved generalization and stronger tool-use
reasoning across diverse multi-step reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs, a powerful tool for structuring information through
relational triplets, have recently become the new front-runner in enhancing
question-answering systems. While traditional Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG) approaches are proficient in fact-based and local context-based
extraction from concise texts, they encounter limitations when addressing the
thematic and holistic understanding of complex, extensive texts, requiring a
deeper analysis of both text and context. This paper presents a comprehensive
technical comparative study of three different methodologies for constructing
knowledge graph triplets and integrating them with Large Language Models (LLMs)
for question answering: spaCy, Stanford CoreNLP-OpenIE, and GraphRAG, all
leveraging open source technologies. We evaluate the effectiveness,
feasibility, and adaptability of these methods by analyzing their capabilities,
state of development, and their impact on the performance of LLM-based question
answering. Experimental results indicate that while OpenIE provides the most
comprehensive coverage of triplets, GraphRAG demonstrates superior reasoning
abilities among the three. We conclude with a discussion on the strengths and
limitations of each method and provide insights into future directions for
improving knowledge graph-based question answering.

Conclusion: 提出了启发式和统计解决方案来缓解这些问题，并讨论了在分阶段或树状奖励结构下学习的开放性挑战

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have shown the
effectiveness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for generating high-quality
intermediate trajectories, particularly in math and symbolic domains. Inspired
by this, we explore how MCTS-derived trajectories, traditionally used for
training value or reward models, can be repurposed to improve policy
optimization in preference-based reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we
focus on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent algorithm that
enables preference-consistent policy learning without value networks. We
propose a staged GRPO training paradigm where completions are derived from
partially revealed MCTS rollouts, introducing a novel tree-structured setting
for advantage estimation. This leads to a rich class of prefix-conditioned
reward signals, which we analyze theoretically and empirically. Our initial
results indicate that while structured advantage estimation can stabilize
updates and better reflect compositional reasoning quality, challenges such as
advantage saturation and reward signal collapse remain. We propose heuristic
and statistical solutions to mitigate these issues and discuss open challenges
for learning under staged or tree-like reward structures.

Abstract: Tournaments are widely used models to represent pairwise dominance between
candidates, alternatives, or teams. We study the problem of providing certified
explanations for why a candidate appears among the winners under various
tournament rules. To this end, we identify minimal supports, minimal
sub-tournaments in which the candidate is guaranteed to win regardless of how
the rest of the tournament is completed (that is, the candidate is a necessary
winner of the sub-tournament). This notion corresponds to an abductive
explanation for the question,"Why does the winner win the tournament", a
central concept in formal explainable AI. We focus on common tournament
solutions: the top cycle, the uncovered set, the Copeland rule, the Borda rule,
the maximin rule, and the weighted uncovered set. For each rule we determine
the size of the smallest minimal supports, and we present polynomial-time
algorithms to compute them for all but the weighted uncovered set, for which
the problem is NP-complete. Finally, we show how minimal supports can serve to
produce compact, certified, and intuitive explanations.

Abstract: Coordinated teamwork is essential in fast-paced decision-making environments
that require dynamic adaptation, often without an opportunity for explicit
communication. Although implicit coordination has been extensively considered
in the existing literature, the majority of work has focused on co-located,
synchronous teamwork (such as sports teams) or, in distributed teams, primarily
on coordination of knowledge work. However, many teams (firefighters, military,
law enforcement, emergency response) must coordinate their movements in
physical space without the benefit of visual cues or extensive explicit
communication. This paper investigates how three dimensions of spatial
coordination, namely exploration diversity, movement specialization, and
adaptive spatial proximity, influence team performance in a collaborative
online search and rescue task where explicit communication is restricted and
team members rely on movement patterns to infer others' intentions and
coordinate actions. Our metrics capture the relational aspects of teamwork by
measuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and alignment of movements
within shared environments. We analyze data from 34 four-person teams (136
participants) assigned to specialized roles in a search and rescue task.
Results show that spatial specialization positively predicts performance, while
adaptive spatial proximity exhibits a marginal inverted U-shaped relationship,
suggesting moderate levels of adaptation are optimal. Furthermore, the temporal
dynamics of these metrics differentiate high- from low-performing teams over
time. These findings provide insights into implicit spatial coordination in
role-based teamwork and highlight the importance of balanced adaptive
strategies, with implications for training and AI-assisted team support
systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the emergence of
general-purpose agents for automating end-to-end machine learning (ML)
workflows, including data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and
competition solving. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in task
coverage, domain diversity, difficulty modeling, and evaluation rigor, failing
to capture the full capabilities of such agents in realistic settings. We
present TAM Bench, a diverse, realistic, and structured benchmark for
evaluating LLM-based agents on end-to-end ML tasks. TAM Bench features three
key innovations: (1) A browser automation and LLM-based task acquisition system
that automatically collects and structures ML challenges from platforms such as
Kaggle, AIcrowd, and Biendata, spanning multiple task types and data modalities
(e.g., tabular, text, image, graph, audio); (2) A leaderboard-driven difficulty
modeling mechanism that estimates task complexity using participant counts and
score dispersion, enabling scalable and objective task calibration; (3) A
multi-dimensional evaluation framework incorporating performance, format
compliance, constraint adherence, and task generalization. Based on 150 curated
AutoML tasks, we construct three benchmark subsets of different sizes -- Lite,
Medium, and Full -- designed for varying evaluation scenarios. The Lite
version, with 18 tasks and balanced coverage across modalities and difficulty
levels, serves as a practical testbed for daily benchmarking and comparative

Abstract: Navigating and understanding complex and unknown environments autonomously
demands more than just basic perception and movement from embodied agents.
Truly effective exploration requires agents to possess higher-level cognitive
abilities, the ability to reason about their surroundings, and make more
informed decisions regarding exploration strategies. However, traditional RL
approaches struggle to balance efficient exploration and semantic understanding
due to limited cognitive capabilities embedded in the small policies for the
agents, leading often to human drivers when dealing with semantic exploration.
In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting a novel Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture that is specifically designed for
resource efficient semantic exploration. A key methodological contribution is
the integration of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) common-sense through a layered
reward function. The VLM query is modeled as a dedicated action, allowing the
agent to strategically query the VLM only when deemed necessary for gaining
external guidance, thereby conserving resources. This mechanism is combined
with a curriculum learning strategy designed to guide learning at different
levels of complexity to ensure robust and stable learning. Our experimental
evaluation results convincingly demonstrate that our agent achieves
significantly enhanced object discovery rates and develops a learned capability
to effectively navigate towards semantically rich regions. Furthermore, it also
shows a strategic mastery of when to prompt for external environmental
information. By demonstrating a practical and scalable method for embedding
common-sense semantic reasoning with autonomous agents, this research provides
a novel approach to pursuing a fully intelligent and self-guided exploration in
robotics.

Conclusion: TORSO方法有效解决了少样本提示依赖问题，能够激发模型内在推理能力，在多个任务上取得优异表现。

Abstract: The approaches that guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate human
reasoning during response generation have emerged as an effective method for
enabling them to solve complex problems in a step-by-step manner, thereby
achieving superior performance. However, most existing approaches using
few-shot prompts to generate responses heavily depend on the provided examples,
limiting the utilization of the model's inherent reasoning capabilities.
Moreover, constructing task-specific few-shot prompts is often costly and may
lead to inconsistencies across different tasks. In this work, we introduce
Template-Oriented Reasoning (TORSO), which elicits the model to utilize
internal reasoning abilities to generate proper responses across various tasks
without the need for manually crafted few-shot examples. Our experimental
results demonstrate that TORSO achieves strong performance on diverse LLMs
benchmarks with reasonable rationales.

trajectories and historical interactions, which makes efficient memory
management essential for both performance and scalability. Existing methods
typically depend on vector retrieval and hierarchical storage, yet they are
prone to noise accumulation, uncontrolled memory expansion, and limited
generalization across domains. To address these challenges, we present SEDM,
Self-Evolving Distributed Memory, a verifiable and adaptive framework that
transforms memory from a passive repository into an active, self-optimizing
component. SEDM integrates verifiable write admission based on reproducible
replay, a self-scheduling memory controller that dynamically ranks and
consolidates entries according to empirical utility, and cross-domain knowledge
diffusion that abstracts reusable insights to support transfer across
heterogeneous tasks. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEDM
improves reasoning accuracy while reducing token overhead compared with strong
memory baselines, and further enables knowledge distilled from fact
verification to enhance multi-hop reasoning. The results highlight SEDM as a
scalable and sustainable memory mechanism for open-ended multi-agent
collaboration. The code will be released in the later stage of this project.

TL;DR: 量子计算模型在图像描述任务中的组合泛化能力研究，相比经典组合模型表现更好


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类认知具有组合泛化能力，但当前AI工具如视觉语言模型缺乏这种能力。量子模型训练效率更高，可能提升组合泛化性能

Method: 在希尔伯特空间中解释组合张量模型的表示，使用变分量子电路学习这些表示。采用两种图像编码技术：多热编码和CLIP模型的角/幅度编码

Result: 使用噪声多热编码获得了良好的概念验证结果。在CLIP图像向量上的表现较为复杂，但仍优于经典组合模型

Conclusion: 量子模型在组合泛化任务中展现出潜力，特别是在多热编码方面表现良好，为量子计算在AI组合推理中的应用提供了初步证据

Abstract: Compositional generalization is a key facet of human cognition, but lacking
in current AI tools such as vision-language models. Previous work examined
whether a compositional tensor-based sentence semantics can overcome the
challenge, but led to negative results. We conjecture that the increased
training efficiency of quantum models will improve performance in these tasks.
We interpret the representations of compositional tensor-based models in
Hilbert spaces and train Variational Quantum Circuits to learn these
representations on an image captioning task requiring compositional
generalization. We used two image encoding techniques: a multi-hot encoding
(MHE) on binary image vectors and an angle/amplitude encoding on image vectors
taken from the vision-language model CLIP. We achieve good proof-of-concept
results using noisy MHE encodings. Performance on CLIP image vectors was more
mixed, but still outperformed classical compositional models.

Motivation: 传统顺序计算模式在确保准确性的同时，难以满足具身AI系统在动态环境中处理高频输入输出需求所需的"思考"频率。

Method: 解耦感知和生成模块，提供受控的流水线并行化；建立共享公共上下文来解决数据陈旧性问题，保证准确性。

Result: 平均吞吐量提升2.54倍，同时达到原始准确性的102.7%。

Conclusion: Auras有效克服了顺序计算的限制，提供了高吞吐量的推理框架，适用于具身AI系统的实时应用。

Abstract: Embodied AI systems operate in dynamic environments, requiring seamless
integration of perception and generation modules to process high-frequency
input and output demands. Traditional sequential computation patterns, while
effective in ensuring accuracy, face significant limitations in achieving the
necessary "thinking" frequency for real-world applications. In this work, we
present Auras, an algorithm-system co-designed inference framework to optimize
the inference frequency of embodied AI agents. Auras disaggregates the
perception and generation and provides controlled pipeline parallelism for them
to achieve high and stable throughput. Faced with the data staleness problem
that appears when the parallelism is increased, Auras establishes a public
context for perception and generation to share, thereby promising the accuracy
of embodied agents. Experimental results show that Auras improves throughput by
2.54x on average while achieving 102.7% of the original accuracy, demonstrating
its efficacy in overcoming the constraints of sequential computation and
providing high throughput.

TL;DR: 论文研究发现，大语言模型在长任务执行中存在自我条件效应，即模型会在包含先前错误的上下文中更容易犯错。通过分离执行能力并提供明确的知识和计划，大模型能够显著提高长任务执行的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决大语言模型在简单任务变长时失败的问题，探索模型规模扩展对长任务执行能力的影响，以及模型在长序列任务中的错误模式。

Method: 通过提供明确的知识和计划来隔离执行能力，测试不同规模模型在多步任务中的表现，分析错误模式特别是自我条件效应，并对比思考模型的表现。

Result: 发现大模型即使在单步准确率相同的情况下也能正确执行更多步骤；观察到模型存在自我条件效应，错误会累积；思考模型能够避免自我条件效应并在单轮中执行更长任务。

Conclusion: 聚焦执行能力可以解释LLM在复杂推理和简单长任务中的表现差异，模型规模和顺序测试时计算对长视野任务有巨大益处，思考模型是解决长任务的有效方法。

Abstract: Does continued scaling of large language models (LLMs) yield diminishing
returns? Real-world value often stems from the length of task an agent can
complete. We start this work by observing the simple but counterintuitive fact
that marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential
improvements in the length of a task a model can successfully complete. Then,
we argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from
mistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. We propose isolating
execution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to
solve a long-horizon task. We find that larger models can correctly execute
significantly more turns even when small models have 100\% single-turn
accuracy. We observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the
number of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations --
curiously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely
to make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns.
Self-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. In contrast,
recent thinking models do not self-condition, and can also execute much longer
tasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on
the length of task they can execute in a single turn. Overall, by focusing on
the ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve
complex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and
highlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time
compute for long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: 该框架为神经网络不确定性估计提供了更直观的方法，方差门控机制和多样性崩溃分析对高风险应用中的决策支持具有重要意义

Abstract: Evaluation of per-sample uncertainty quantification from neural networks is
essential for decision-making involving high-risk applications. A common
approach is to use the predictive distribution from Bayesian or approximation
models and decompose the corresponding predictive uncertainty into epistemic
(model-related) and aleatoric (data-related) components. However, additive
decomposition has recently been questioned. In this work, we propose an
intuitive framework for uncertainty estimation and decomposition based on the
signal-to-noise ratio of class probability distributions across different model
predictions. We introduce a variance-gated measure that scales predictions by a
confidence factor derived from ensembles. We use this measure to discuss the
existence of a collapse in the diversity of committee machines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的矩阵乘性权重更新算法，在矩阵版本的学习专家建议问题中实现了实例最优的遗憾界，计算复杂度与原始MMWU相同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的MMWU算法在矩阵LEA问题上只能达到最小最大最优的遗憾界，但无法实现实例最优性能。本文旨在开发一个既能保持计算效率又能获得更好遗憾界的改进算法。

Method: 开发了一个通用的基于势能的矩阵LEA框架，MMWU是其特例。通过新的单边Jensen迹不等式和拉普拉斯变换技术，应用了来自向量LEA问题的最优势函数（基于虚误差函数）。

Result: 新算法实现了O(√(T·S(X||d⁻¹I_d)))的实例最优遗憾界，其中S是量子相对熵。计算复杂度与MMWU相同，在量子态学习、去极化噪声、随机量子态和Gibbs态学习等应用中优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了矩阵LEA问题的第一个实例最优算法，遗憾界的改进是"免费"的（不增加计算成本），在量子学习理论中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: The Matrix Multiplicative Weight Update (MMWU) is a seminal online learning
algorithm with numerous applications. Applied to the matrix version of the
Learning from Expert Advice (LEA) problem on the $d$-dimensional spectraplex,
it is well known that MMWU achieves the minimax-optimal regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{T\log d})$, where $T$ is the time horizon. In this paper, we present
an improved algorithm achieving the instance-optimal regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{T\cdot S(X||d^{-1}I_d)})$, where $X$ is the comparator in the regret,
$I_d$ is the identity matrix, and $S(\cdot||\cdot)$ denotes the quantum
relative entropy. Furthermore, our algorithm has the same computational
complexity as MMWU, indicating that the improvement in the regret bound is
``free''.
  Technically, we first develop a general potential-based framework for matrix
LEA, with MMWU being its special case induced by the standard exponential
potential. Then, the crux of our analysis is a new ``one-sided'' Jensen's trace
inequality built on a Laplace transform technique, which allows the application
of general potential functions beyond exponential to matrix LEA. Our algorithm
is finally induced by an optimal potential function from the vector LEA
problem, based on the imaginary error function.
  Complementing the above, we provide a memory lower bound for matrix LEA, and
explore the applications of our algorithm in quantum learning theory. We show
that it outperforms the state of the art for learning quantum states corrupted
by depolarization noise, random quantum states, and Gibbs states. In addition,
applying our algorithm to linearized convex losses enables predicting nonlinear
quantum properties, such as purity, quantum virtual cooling, and R\'{e}nyi-$2$
correlation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种对抗性奖励腐败下的鲁棒Q学习算法，在异步采样和时间相关数据下实现了有限时间收敛，收敛速率与非对抗情况相近，仅增加与腐败样本比例成正比的附加项。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习中的奖励信号可能受到极端噪声、传感器故障或恶意攻击的对抗性腐败，这会严重降低传统算法（如Q-learning）的性能。

Method: 提出了一种新的可证明鲁棒的Q-learning变体算法，即使在部分观测奖励被对手任意扰动的情况下也能有效运行。还提出了一个不需要先验知道真实奖励分布统计信息的算法变体。

Result: 在异步采样模型下，尽管存在对抗性腐败，算法的有限时间收敛速率与非对抗情况下的现有结果匹配，仅增加与腐败样本比例成正比的附加项。信息论下界表明这个附加项是不可避免的。

Conclusion: 这项工作为异步Q-learning提供了首个有限时间鲁棒性保证，填补了鲁棒强化学习领域的重要空白。

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the optimal policy in a discounted,
infinite-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) setting where the reward signal is
subject to adversarial corruption. Such corruption, which may arise from
extreme noise, sensor faults, or malicious attacks, can severely degrade the
performance of classical algorithms such as Q-learning. To address this
challenge, we propose a new provably robust variant of the Q-learning algorithm
that operates effectively even when a fraction of the observed rewards are
arbitrarily perturbed by an adversary. Under the asynchronous sampling model
with time-correlated data, we establish that despite adversarial corruption,
the finite-time convergence rate of our algorithm matches that of existing
results for the non-adversarial case, up to an additive term proportional to
the fraction of corrupted samples. Moreover, we derive an information-theoretic
lower bound revealing that the additive corruption term in our upper bounds is
unavoidable.
  Next, we propose a variant of our algorithm that requires no prior knowledge
of the statistics of the true reward distributions. The analysis of this
setting is particularly challenging and is enabled by carefully exploiting a
refined Azuma-Hoeffding inequality for almost-martingales, a technical tool
that might be of independent interest. Collectively, our contributions provide
the first finite-time robustness guarantees for asynchronous Q-learning,
bridging a significant gap in robust RL.

Conclusion: 所提出的分布鲁棒优化框架能够有效处理组内分布不确定性，在噪声和非平稳环境中实现更稳健的最差组性能优化。

Abstract: The performance of machine learning (ML) models critically depends on the
quality and representativeness of the training data. In applications with
multiple heterogeneous data generating sources, standard ML methods often learn
spurious correlations that perform well on average but degrade performance for
atypical or underrepresented groups. Prior work addresses this issue by
optimizing the worst-group performance. However, these approaches typically
assume that the underlying data distributions for each group can be accurately
estimated using the training data, a condition that is frequently violated in
noisy, non-stationary, and evolving environments. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that relies on Wasserstein-based distributionally robust
optimization (DRO) to account for the distributional uncertainty within each
group, while simultaneously preserving the objective of improving the
worst-group performance. We develop a gradient descent-ascent algorithm to
solve the proposed DRO problem and provide convergence results. Finally, we
validate the effectiveness of our method on real-world data.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide,
underscoring the importance of accurate and scalable diagnostic systems.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is central to detecting cardiac abnormalities,
yet challenges such as noise, class imbalance, and dataset heterogeneity limit
current methods. To address these issues, we propose FoundationalECGNet, a
foundational framework for automated ECG classification. The model integrates a
dual-stage denoising by Morlet and Daubechies wavelets transformation,
Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), Graph Attention Networks (GAT),
and Time Series Transformers (TST) to jointly capture spatial and temporal
dependencies in multi-channel ECG signals. FoundationalECGNet first
distinguishes between Normal and Abnormal ECG signals, and then classifies the
Abnormal signals into one of five cardiac conditions: Arrhythmias, Conduction
Disorders, Myocardial Infarction, QT Abnormalities, or Hypertrophy. Across
multiple datasets, the model achieves a 99% F1-score for Normal vs. Abnormal
classification and shows state-of-the-art performance in multi-class disease
detection, including a 99% F1-score for Conduction Disorders and Hypertrophy,
as well as a 98.9% F1-score for Arrhythmias. Additionally, the model provides
risk level estimations to facilitate clinical decision-making. In conclusion,
FoundationalECGNet represents a scalable, interpretable, and generalizable
solution for automated ECG analysis, with the potential to improve diagnostic
precision and patient outcomes in healthcare settings. We'll share the code
after acceptance.

Motivation: 分析LRP类归因方法的数值特性，特别是研究归因值的分布规律和收敛性质，为多数据增强场景和Smoothgrad类方法提供理论指导。

Method: 将LRP归因方法表示为修正梯度矩阵的乘积，建立与链式法则中雅可比矩阵乘法的类比，推导奇异值上界和分量界，获得控制收敛的乘性常数。

Result: 获得了控制经验均值收敛到期望的乘性常数，发现LRP-beta方法的常数与权重范数无关，这与基于梯度的方法和LRP-epsilon形成显著区别。

Conclusion: LRP-beta方法在数值稳定性方面具有优势，其收敛常数不依赖于权重范数，这一发现对多数据增强和Smoothgrad类归因方法具有重要意义。

Abstract: We analyze numerical properties of Layer-wise relevance propagation
(LRP)-type attribution methods by representing them as a product of modified
gradient matrices. This representation creates an analogy to matrix
multiplications of Jacobi-matrices which arise from the chain rule of
differentiation. In order to shed light on the distribution of attribution
values, we derive upper bounds for singular values. Furthermore we derive
component-wise bounds for attribution map values. As a main result, we apply
these component-wise bounds to obtain multiplicative constants. These constants
govern the convergence of empirical means of attributions to expectations of
attribution maps. This finding has important implications for scenarios where
multiple non-geometric data augmentations are applied to individual test
samples, as well as for Smoothgrad-type attribution methods. In particular, our
analysis reveals that the constants for LRP-beta remain independent of weight
norms, a significant distinction from both gradient-based methods and
LRP-epsilon.

Conclusion: 碳感知调度策略能有效减少联邦学习的碳排放，同时保持模型准确性，为可持续机器学习提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Training large-scale machine learning models incurs substantial carbon
emissions. Federated Learning (FL), by distributing computation across
geographically dispersed clients, offers a natural framework to leverage
regional and temporal variations in Carbon Intensity (CI). This paper
investigates how to reduce emissions in FL through carbon-aware client
selection and training scheduling. We first quantify the emission savings of a
carbon-aware scheduling policy that leverages slack time -- permitting a modest
extension of the training duration so that clients can defer local training
rounds to lower-carbon periods. We then examine the performance trade-offs of
such scheduling which stem from statistical heterogeneity among clients,
selection bias in participation, and temporal correlation in model updates. To
leverage these trade-offs, we construct a carbon-aware scheduler that
integrates slack time, $\alpha$-fair carbon allocation, and a global
fine-tuning phase. Experiments on real-world CI data show that our scheduler
outperforms slack-agnostic baselines, achieving higher model accuracy across a
wide range of carbon budgets, with especially strong gains under tight carbon
constraints.

Abstract: Spin coating polymer thin films to achieve specific mechanical properties is
inherently a multi-objective optimization problem. We present a framework that
integrates an active Pareto front learning algorithm (PyePAL) with
visualization and explainable AI techniques to optimize processing parameters.
PyePAL uses Gaussian process models to predict objective values (hardness and
elasticity) from the design variables (spin speed, dilution, and polymer
mixture), guiding the adaptive selection of samples toward promising regions of
the design space. To enable interpretable insights into the high-dimensional
design space, we utilize UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)
for two-dimensional visualization of the Pareto front exploration.
Additionally, we incorporate fuzzy linguistic summaries, which translate the
learned relationships between process parameters and performance objectives
into linguistic statements, thus enhancing the explainability and understanding
of the optimization results. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
efficiently identifies promising polymer designs, while the visual and
linguistic explanations facilitate expert-driven analysis and knowledge
discovery.

Abstract: Transformers have the representational capacity to simulate Massively

sub-quadratic time complexity. We prove that ANNA-transformers (1) retain the
expressive power previously established for standard attention in terms of
matching the capabilities of MPC algorithms, and (2) can solve key reasoning

framework, we further prove that constant-depth ANNA-transformers can simulate
constant-depth low-rank transformers, thereby providing a unified way to reason

Abstract: Anomaly detection is critical in domains such as cybersecurity and finance,
especially when working with large-scale tabular data. Yet, unsupervised
anomaly detection -- where no labeled anomalies are available -- remains a
significant challenge. Although various deep learning methods have been
proposed to model a dataset's joint distribution, real-world tabular data often
contain heterogeneous contexts (e.g., different users), making globally rare
events normal under certain contexts. Consequently, relying on a single global
distribution can overlook these contextual nuances, degrading detection
performance. In this paper, we present a context-conditional anomaly detection
framework tailored for tabular datasets. Our approach automatically identifies
context features and models the conditional data distribution using a simple
deep autoencoder. Extensive experiments on multiple tabular benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches,
underscoring the importance of context in accurately distinguishing anomalous
from normal instances.

TL;DR: 提出混合专家模型(MoWE)，通过动态组合现有天气模型的输出来提升预测精度，相比最佳单一模型降低10% RMSE


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据驱动的天气模型近年性能提升趋于平缓，需要新的方法来突破现有局限

Method: 使用基于Vision Transformer的门控网络，动态学习多个专家模型在每个网格点的权重贡献，考虑预报提前时间条件

Result: 在2天预报范围内，RMSE比最佳AI天气模型降低10%，显著优于单一专家模型和简单平均方法

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种计算高效且可扩展的策略，通过充分利用领先的高质量预报模型来推动数据驱动天气预测的发展

Abstract: Data-driven weather models have recently achieved state-of-the-art
performance, yet progress has plateaued in recent years. This paper introduces
a Mixture of Experts (MoWE) approach as a novel paradigm to overcome these
limitations, not by creating a new forecaster, but by optimally combining the
outputs of existing models. The MoWE model is trained with significantly lower
computational resources than the individual experts. Our model employs a Vision
Transformer-based gating network that dynamically learns to weight the
contributions of multiple "expert" models at each grid point, conditioned on
forecast lead time. This approach creates a synthesized deterministic forecast
that is more accurate than any individual component in terms of Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method,
achieving up to a 10% lower RMSE than the best-performing AI weather model on a
2-day forecast horizon, significantly outperforming individual experts as well
as a simple average across experts. This work presents a computationally
efficient and scalable strategy to push the state of the art in data-driven
weather prediction by making the most out of leading high-quality forecast
models.

Motivation: 可再生能源和分布式能源的集成对传统电力系统保护方案构成挑战，需要评估机器学习在保护任务中的应用范围和性能，为动态电网条件寻找合适方法。

Method: 采用PRISMA范围综述框架，系统分析100多篇文献，建立ML导向的保护任务分类法，解决术语不一致问题，提出标准化报告实践指南。

Result: ML模型在仿真数据集上通常表现出高准确性，但在真实条件下的性能验证不足；现有文献碎片化，方法严谨性、数据集质量和评估指标不一致；缺乏标准化阻碍了结果可比性和发现的可推广性。

Conclusion: 需要优先考虑公共基准数据集、现实验证方法和先进ML架构，推动ML保护从理论承诺走向实际部署，以应对日益动态和分散的电力系统挑战。

Abstract: The integration of renewable and distributed energy resources reshapes modern
power systems, challenging conventional protection schemes. This scoping review
synthesizes recent literature on machine learning (ML) applications in power
system protection and disturbance management, following the PRISMA for Scoping
Reviews framework. Based on over 100 publications, three key objectives are
addressed: (i) assessing the scope of ML research in protection tasks; (ii)
evaluating ML performance across diverse operational scenarios; and (iii)
identifying methods suitable for evolving grid conditions. ML models often
demonstrate high accuracy on simulated datasets; however, their performance
under real-world conditions remains insufficiently validated. The existing
literature is fragmented, with inconsistencies in methodological rigor, dataset
quality, and evaluation metrics. This lack of standardization hampers the
comparability of results and limits the generalizability of findings. To
address these challenges, this review introduces a ML-oriented taxonomy for
protection tasks, resolves key terminological inconsistencies, and advocates
for standardized reporting practices. It further provides guidelines for
comprehensive dataset documentation, methodological transparency, and
consistent evaluation protocols, aiming to improve reproducibility and enhance
the practical relevance of research outcomes. Critical gaps remain, including
the scarcity of real-world validation, insufficient robustness testing, and
limited consideration of deployment feasibility. Future research should
prioritize public benchmark datasets, realistic validation methods, and
advanced ML architectures. These steps are essential to move ML-based
protection from theoretical promise to practical deployment in increasingly
dynamic and decentralized power systems.

*Chaeyun Ko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STRIDE是一个可扩展的XAI框架，通过RKHS中的正交函数分解避免特征子集枚举，提供功能组件而非标量归因，在表格数据上实现3倍加速和高保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有XAI框架的两个主要限制：特征子集枚举的指数级计算成本和标量归因的表达能力有限问题。

Method: 基于再生核希尔伯特空间的正交函数分解，通过递归核中心化程序的分析投影方案计算功能组件，避免显式子集枚举。

Result: 在10个数据集上实现中位数约3倍的加速（0.6-9.7倍范围），保持高保真度（R² 0.81-0.999）和良好的排序一致性。

Conclusion: STRIDE通过提供结构化功能视角补充标量归因方法，支持新颖的诊断功能如'组件手术'来量化特定交互作用的影响。

Abstract: Most explainable AI (XAI) frameworks face two practical limitations: the
exponential cost of reasoning over feature subsets and the reduced
expressiveness of summarizing effects as single scalar values. We present
STRIDE, a scalable framework that aims to mitigate both issues by framing
explanation as a subset-enumeration-free, orthogonal functional decomposition
in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Rather than focusing only on
scalar attributions, STRIDE computes functional components f_S(x_S) via an
analytical projection scheme based on a recursive kernel-centering procedure,
avoiding explicit subset enumeration. In the tabular setups we study, the
approach is model-agnostic, provides both local and global views, and is
supported by theoretical results on orthogonality and L^2 convergence under
stated assumptions. On public tabular benchmarks in our environment, we
observed speedups ranging from 0.6 times (slower than TreeSHAP on a small
dataset) to 9.7 times (California), with a median approximate 3.0 times across
10 datasets, while maintaining high fidelity (R^2 between 0.81 and 0.999) and
substantial rank agreement on most datasets. Overall, STRIDE complements scalar
attribution methods by offering a structured functional perspective, enabling
novel diagnostics like 'component surgery' to quantitatively measure the impact
of specific interactions within our experimental scope.

Motivation: 机器学习中选择泛化能力好的模型具有挑战性，Rashomon效应指多个模型在相同问题上表现相似的情况，这在制造过程和医疗诊断等现实场景中常见

Method: 基于模型性能和解释对模型进行分组，构建集成以最大化多样性同时保持预测准确性，确保每个模型覆盖解空间的不同区域

Result: 在开放和专有的真实数据集上验证，当Rashomon比例较大时，AUROC提升高达0.20+，在各种实际应用中展示了稳健性、实用性和有效性

Conclusion: Rashomon Ensemble方法通过利用模型多样性有效提高了泛化性能，对分布变化和未见数据变化具有更强的鲁棒性，在实际业务应用中具有显著价值

Abstract: Creating models from past observations and ensuring their effectiveness on
new data is the essence of machine learning. However, selecting models that
generalize well remains a challenging task. Related to this topic, the Rashomon
Effect refers to cases where multiple models perform similarly well for a given
learning problem. This often occurs in real-world scenarios, like the
manufacturing process or medical diagnosis, where diverse patterns in data lead
to multiple high-performing solutions. We propose the Rashomon Ensemble, a
method that strategically selects models from these diverse high-performing
solutions to improve generalization. By grouping models based on both their
performance and explanations, we construct ensembles that maximize diversity
while maintaining predictive accuracy. This selection ensures that each model
covers a distinct region of the solution space, making the ensemble more robust
to distribution shifts and variations in unseen data. We validate our approach
on both open and proprietary collaborative real-world datasets, demonstrating
up to 0.20+ AUROC improvements in scenarios where the Rashomon ratio is large.
Additionally, we demonstrate tangible benefits for businesses in various
real-world applications, highlighting the robustness, practicality, and
effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: We study the Riemannian geometry of the Deep Linear Network (DLN) as a
foundation for a thermodynamic description of the learning process. The main
tools are the use of group actions to analyze overparametrization and the use
of Riemannian submersion from the space of parameters to the space of
observables. The foliation of the balanced manifold in the parameter space by
group orbits is used to define and compute a Boltzmann entropy. We also show
that the Riemannian geometry on the space of observables defined in [2] is
obtained by Riemannian submersion of the balanced manifold. The main technical
step is an explicit construction of an orthonormal basis for the tangent space
of the balanced manifold using the theory of Jacobi matrices.

TL;DR: Sensitivity-LoRA是一种高效的LLM微调方法，通过基于权重矩阵的全局和局部敏感度动态分配秩，解决了传统LoRA统一秩分配的问题，具有更好的计算效率和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA方法对所有增量矩阵使用统一秩分配，而现有的秩分配技术计算效率低、复杂且不稳定，限制了实际应用。需要一种更高效、稳定的秩分配方法。

Method: 提出Sensitivity-LoRA方法，利用损失函数的二阶导数（Hessian矩阵）来捕捉权重敏感度，基于全局和局部敏感度动态分配秩，实现最优秩分配且计算开销最小。

Result: 实验结果表明，Sensitivity-LoRA在各种任务和基准测试中表现出强大的有效性、效率和稳定性。

Conclusion: Sensitivity-LoRA通过动态秩分配解决了LoRA方法的局限性，为资源受限环境下的LLM专业化提供了更高效、稳定的微调解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed both everyday life and
scientific research. However, adapting LLMs from general-purpose models to
specialized tasks remains challenging, particularly in resource-constrained
environments. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a prominent method within
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), has emerged as a promising approach to
LLMs by approximating model weight updates using low-rank decomposition.
However, LoRA is limited by its uniform rank ( r ) allocation to each
incremental matrix, and existing rank allocation techniques aimed at addressing
this issue remain computationally inefficient, complex, and unstable, hindering
practical applications. To address these limitations, we propose
Sensitivity-LoRA, an efficient fine-tuning method that dynamically allocates
ranks to weight matrices based on both their global and local sensitivities. It
leverages the second-order derivatives (Hessian Matrix) of the loss function to
effectively capture weight sensitivity, enabling optimal rank allocation with
minimal computational overhead. Our experimental results have demonstrated
robust effectiveness, efficiency and stability of Sensitivity-LoRA across
diverse tasks and benchmarks.

Motivation: 传统的相关性学习模型无法区分真实因果关系与偏偏相关，影响模型的稳健性、可解释性和沿午性能力

Method: 集成多元格兰杰因果性(MVGC)和PCMCI+算法进行因果特征选择，并将其与混合神经网络结构相结合，使用1979-2021年43年的北极海冰范围数据和海洋-大气变量

Result: 实验结果显示，统计因果输入特征能够提高预测准确性和可解释性，同时减少不必要的特征数量并提高计算效率

Conclusion: 该因果性深度学习框架虽然在北极海冰预测中得到验证，但具有广泛的适用性，可以应用于其他动态高维预测问题，为因果性预测模型提供了可扩展的方法

Abstract: Conventional machine learning and deep learning models typically rely on
correlation-based learning, which often fails to distinguish genuine causal
relationships from spurious associations, limiting their robustness,
interpretability, and ability to generalize. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce a causality-aware deep learning framework that integrates
Multivariate Granger Causality (MVGC) and PCMCI+ for causal feature selection
within a hybrid neural architecture. Leveraging 43 years (1979-2021) of Arctic
Sea Ice Extent (SIE) data and associated ocean-atmospheric variables at daily
and monthly resolutions, the proposed method identifies causally influential
predictors, prioritizes direct causes of SIE dynamics, reduces unnecessary
features, and enhances computational efficiency. Experimental results show that
incorporating causal inputs leads to improved prediction accuracy and
interpretability across varying lead times. While demonstrated on Arctic SIE
forecasting, the framework is broadly applicable to other dynamic,
high-dimensional domains, offering a scalable approach that advances both the
theoretical foundations and practical performance of causality-informed
predictive modeling.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于物理信息神经网络(PINN)的连续时间多自然强化学习框架(CT-MARL)，通过价值梯度迭代(VGI)模块解决了多自然设置中求解Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman方程的难题，在复杂动力学系统中实现了更好的性能和扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的连续时间强化学习(CTRL)方法主要限于单自然领域，因为在多自然设置中遇到两大挑战：维数灾难问题和中央化价值函数近似困难。

Method: 使用物理信息神经网络(PINN)来近似HJB基础的价值函数，并通过价值梯度迭代(VGI)模块迭代精炼沿轨迹的价值梯度，以提高梯度的准确性和政策学习效果。

Result: 在连续时间版本的多自然粒子环境(MPE)和多自然MuJoCo测试中，该方法一贯表现出艾现有连续时间RL基准方法，并能够扩展到复杂的多自然动力学系统。

Conclusion: 该研究成功将连续时间强化学习扩展到多自然领域，通过PINN和VGI模块有效解决了HJB方程求解的难题，为复杂动力学系统提供了一种可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with complex dynamical
systems that demand interactions at high frequencies or irregular time
intervals. Continuous-time RL (CTRL) has emerged as a promising alternative by
replacing discrete-time Bellman recursion with differential value functions
defined as viscosity solutions of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation.
While CTRL has shown promise, its applications have been largely limited to the
single-agent domain. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (i)
conventional solution methods for HJB equations suffer from the curse of
dimensionality (CoD), making them intractable in high-dimensional systems; and
(ii) even with HJB-based learning approaches, accurately approximating
centralized value functions in multi-agent settings remains difficult, which in
turn destabilizes policy training. In this paper, we propose a CT-MARL
framework that uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate
HJB-based value functions at scale. To ensure the value is consistent with its
differential structure, we align value learning with value-gradient learning by
introducing a Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) module that iteratively refines
value gradients along trajectories. This improves gradient fidelity, in turn
yielding more accurate values and stronger policy learning. We evaluate our
method using continuous-time variants of standard benchmarks, including
multi-agent particle environment (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo. Our results
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing continuous-time
RL baselines and scales to complex multi-agent dynamics.

TL;DR: 使用机器学习模型预测ISP对等互联伙伴选择，XGBoost模型达到98%准确率，可自动化对等互联流程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISP之间的对等互联过程复杂耗时，需要自动化工具来提高全球互联网生态系统的效率

Method: 利用PeeringDB、CAIDA等公开数据，评估树基模型、神经网络和Transformer三类机器学习模型来预测对等互联关系

Result: 树基模型（特别是XGBoost）表现最佳，准确率达98%，对时间、空间变化和缺失数据具有强鲁棒性

Conclusion: 该方法可帮助ISP完全自动化对等互联伙伴选择过程，实现更高效优化的互联网生态系统

Abstract: Internet service providers (ISPs) need to connect with other ISPs to provide
global connectivity services to their users. To ensure global connectivity,
ISPs can either use transit service(s) or establish direct peering
relationships between themselves via Internet exchange points (IXPs). Peering
offers more room for ISP-specific optimizations and is preferred, but it often
involves a lengthy and complex process. Automating peering partner selection
can enhance efficiency in the global Internet ecosystem. We explore the use of
publicly available data on ISPs to develop a machine learning (ML) model that
can predict whether an ISP pair should peer or not. At first, we explore public
databases, e.g., PeeringDB, CAIDA, etc., to gather data on ISPs. Then, we
evaluate the performance of three broad types of ML models for predicting
peering relationships: tree-based, neural network-based, and transformer-based.
Among these, we observe that tree-based models achieve the highest accuracy and
efficiency in our experiments. The XGBoost model trained with publicly
available data showed promising performance, with a 98% accuracy rate in
predicting peering partners. In addition, the model demonstrated great
resilience to variations in time, space, and missing data. We envision that
ISPs can adopt our method to fully automate the peering partner selection
process, thus transitioning to a more efficient and optimized Internet
ecosystem.

TL;DR: HISPASpoof是首个大规模西班牙语合成语音检测数据集，包含6种口音的真实语音和6种零样本文本转语音系统生成的合成语音，用于解决西班牙语在语音取证领域的代表性不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然零样本语音克隆和文本转语音技术快速发展，但现有的检测器主要针对英语和中文，西班牙语（全球超过6亿人使用）在语音取证领域缺乏代表性数据集。

Method: 构建HISPASpoof数据集，包含来自公开语料库的6种口音真实语音，以及使用6种零样本TTS系统生成的合成语音。评估了5种代表性检测方法在西班牙语上的性能。

Result: 研究发现基于英语训练的检测器无法有效泛化到西班牙语，而使用HISPASpoof训练能显著提升检测性能。同时评估了合成语音溯源（识别生成方法）的性能。

Conclusion: HISPASpoof为推进西班牙语可靠和包容性语音取证提供了关键基准，填补了西班牙语在语音防伪检测领域的空白。

Abstract: Zero-shot Voice Cloning (VC) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) methods have advanced
rapidly, enabling the generation of highly realistic synthetic speech and
raising serious concerns about their misuse. While numerous detectors have been
developed for English and Chinese, Spanish-spoken by over 600 million people
worldwide-remains underrepresented in speech forensics. To address this gap, we
introduce HISPASpoof, the first large-scale Spanish dataset designed for
synthetic speech detection and attribution. It includes real speech from public
corpora across six accents and synthetic speech generated with six zero-shot
TTS systems. We evaluate five representative methods, showing that detectors
trained on English fail to generalize to Spanish, while training on HISPASpoof
substantially improves detection. We also evaluate synthetic speech attribution
performance on HISPASpoof, i.e., identifying the generation method of synthetic
speech. HISPASpoof thus provides a critical benchmark for advancing reliable
and inclusive speech forensics in Spanish.

Conclusion: 这些发现为在未来边缘智能系统中部署基于Transformer的语义通信提供了一种可扩展且高效的方法，通过适应性策略根据通道质量动态调整合并程度，实现延迟与语义保真度的按需交换。

Abstract: Large-scale transformer models have emerged as a powerful tool for semantic
communication systems, enabling edge devices to extract rich representations
for robust inference across noisy wireless channels. However, their substantial
computational demands remain a major barrier to practical deployment in
resource-constrained 6G networks. In this paper, we present a training-free
framework for adaptive token merging in pretrained vision transformers to
jointly reduce inference time and transmission resource usage. We formulate the
selection of per-layer merging proportions as a multi-objective optimization
problem to balance accuracy and computational cost. We employ Gaussian
process-based Bayesian optimization to construct a Pareto frontier of optimal
configurations, enabling flexible runtime adaptation to dynamic application
requirements and channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms other baselines and achieves significant
reductions in floating-point operations while maintaining competitive accuracy
across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Additional
results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive policies that adjust merging
aggressiveness in response to channel quality, providing a practical mechanism
to trade off latency and semantic fidelity on demand. These findings establish
a scalable and efficient approach for deploying transformer-based semantic
communication in future edge intelligence systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列级RL方法在移植PPO/GRPO式裁剪时存在固定裁剪范围对长短响应进行系统性重加权的问题，扭曲了有效目标函数。

Method: 提出FSPO方法，在序列对数IS比率上应用高斯启发的裁剪带，包含KL校正漂移项并以√L比例缩放，实现长度公平的裁剪。

Result: FSPO在不同长度区间上平整了裁剪率，稳定了训练过程，在多个评估数据集上均优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: FSPO通过理论形式化的长度公平性概念和实用的高斯裁剪方案，有效解决了序列级RL中的长度偏差问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level
reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping
directly in the importance-sampling (IS) weight space. We revisit
sequence-level RL methods and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping
is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short
vs. long responses, distorting the effective objective. Theoretically, we
formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that
small LRE yields a directional cosine guarantee between the clipped and true
updates. FSPO introduces a simple, Gaussian-motivated remedy: we clip the
sequence log-IS ratio with a band that applies a KL-corrected drift term and
scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins,
stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation
datasets.

"Statistical Similarity Trap", rewarding blurry predictions while missing rare,
high-impact events. We provide quantitative evidence of this trap, showing
sophisticated baselines achieve 97.9% correlation yet 0.00 CSI for dangerous
convection detection. We introduce DART (Dual Architecture for Regression
Tasks), a framework addressing the challenge of transforming coarse atmospheric
forecasts into high-resolution satellite brightness temperature fields
optimized for extreme convection detection (below 220 K). DART employs
dual-decoder architecture with explicit background/extreme decomposition,
physically motivated oversampling, and task-specific loss functions. We present
four key findings: (1) empirical validation of the Statistical Similarity Trap
across multiple sophisticated baselines; (2) the "IVT Paradox", removing
Integrated Water Vapor Transport, widely regarded as essential for atmospheric
river analysis, improves extreme convection detection by 270%; (3)
architectural necessity demonstrated through operational flexibility (DART
achieves CSI = 0.273 with bias = 2.52 vs. 6.72 for baselines at equivalent
CSI), and (4) real-world validation with the August 2023 Chittagong flooding
disaster as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically address this hybrid conversion-segmentation-downscaling task,
with no direct prior benchmarks identified in existing literature. Our
validation against diverse statistical and deep learning baselines sufficiently
demonstrates DART's specialized design. The framework enables precise
operational calibration through beta-tuning, trains in under 10 minutes on
standard hardware, and integrates seamlessly with existing meteorological
workflows, demonstrating a pathway toward trustworthy AI for extreme weather
preparedness.

Conclusion: IP3O算法有效解决了约束强化学习的稳定性问题，通过渐进惩罚机制实现了更好的约束满足和性能表现，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to maximize the return while
adhering to predefined constraint limits, which represent domain-specific
safety requirements. In continuous control settings, where learning agents
govern system actions, balancing the trade-off between reward maximization and
constraint satisfaction remains a significant challenge. Policy optimization
methods often exhibit instability near constraint boundaries, resulting in
suboptimal training performance. To address this issue, we introduce a novel
approach that integrates an adaptive incentive mechanism in addition to the
reward structure to stay within the constraint bound before approaching the
constraint boundary. Building on this insight, we propose Incrementally
Penalized Proximal Policy Optimization (IP3O), a practical algorithm that
enforces a progressively increasing penalty to stabilize training dynamics.
Through empirical evaluation on benchmark environments, we demonstrate the
efficacy of IP3O compared to the performance of state-of-the-art Safe RL
algorithms. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees by deriving a bound
on the worst-case error of the optimality achieved by our algorithm.

Abstract: Agro-tourism serves as a strategic economic model designed to facilitate
rural development by diversifying income streams for local communities like
farmers while promoting the conservation of indigenous cultural heritage and
traditional agricultural practices. As a very booming subdomain of tourism,
there is a need to study the strategies for the growth of Agro-tourism in
detail. The current study has identified the important indicators for the
growth and enhancement of agro-tourism. The study is conducted in two phases:
identification of the important indicators through a comprehensive literature
review and in the second phase state-of-the-art techniques were used to
identify the important indicators for the growth of agro-tourism. The
indicators are also called features synonymously, the machine learning models
for feature selection were applied and it was observed that the Least Absolute
Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method combined with, the machine
Learning Classifiers such as Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Trees (DT),
Random Forest (RF) Tree, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBOOST) models were
used to suggest the growth of the agro-tourism. The results show that with the
LASSO method, LR model gives the highest classification accuracy of 98% in
70-30% train-test data followed by RF with 95% accuracy. Similarly, in the
80-20% train-test data LR maintains the highest accuracy at 99%, while DT and

TL;DR: Vejde框架结合数据抽象、图神经网络和强化学习，为具有丰富结构化状态的决策问题生成归纳策略函数，能够在不同规模和结构的问题上实现良好泛化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决具有丰富结构化状态（如对象类和关系）的决策问题，传统方法难以处理变化的问题规模和结构，需要能够归纳泛化的策略函数

Method: 将MDP状态表示为实体事实数据库，转换为二分图，通过神经消息传递映射到潜在状态。使用监督学习和强化学习训练策略，采用因子化表示处理不同规模问题

Result: 在8个RDDL问题域的测试中，Vejde策略在未见过的测试实例上平均泛化良好，得分接近针对特定实例训练的MLP代理

Conclusion: Vejde框架能够有效生成可泛化的归纳策略，在结构化决策问题中表现优异，为处理复杂关系型状态提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: We present and evaluate Vejde; a framework which combines data abstraction,
graph neural networks and reinforcement learning to produce inductive policy
functions for decision problems with richly structured states, such as object
classes and relations. MDP states are represented as data bases of facts about
entities, and Vejde converts each state to a bipartite graph, which is mapped
to latent states through neural message passing. The factored representation of
both states and actions allows Vejde agents to handle problems of varying size
and structure. We tested Vejde agents on eight problem domains defined in RDDL,
with ten problem instances each, where policies were trained using both
supervised and reinforcement learning. To test policy generalization, we
separate problem instances in two sets, one for training and the other solely
for testing. Test results on unseen instances for the Vejde agents were
compared to MLP agents trained on each problem instance, as well as the online
planning algorithm Prost. Our results show that Vejde policies in average
generalize to the test instances without a significant loss in score.
Additionally, the inductive agents received scores on unseen test instances
that on average were close to the instance-specific MLP agents.

Motivation: 解决现有问答模拟器中LLM-free方法性能不佳而LLM-based方法推理速度慢、资源消耗高的问题

Method: 提出LLM蒸馏模拟器(LDSim)，从大型语言模型中蒸馏领域知识和推理能力来辅助预测

Result: 在模拟任务和知识追踪任务上都取得了强劲的结果

Conclusion: LDSim方法在性能和效率之间取得了良好平衡，为教育推荐系统提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: The question-answering (QA) simulator is a model that mimics real student
learning behaviors and predicts their correctness of their responses to
questions. QA simulators enable educational recommender systems (ERS) to
collect large amounts of training data without interacting with real students,
thereby preventing harmful recommendations made by an undertrained ERS from
undermining actual student learning. Given the QA history, there are two
categories of solutions to predict the correctness, conducting the simulation:
(1) LLM-free methods, which apply a traditional sequential model to transfer
the QA history into a vector representation first, and make predictions based
on the representation; (2) LLM-based methods, which leverage the domain
knowledge and reasoning capability of LLM to enhence the prediction. LLM-free
methods offer fast inference but generally yield suboptimal performance. In
contrast, most LLM-based methods achieve better results, but at the cost of
slower inference speed and higher GPU memory consumption. In this paper, we
propose a method named LLM Distillation based Simulator (LDSim), which distills
domain knowledge and reasoning capability from an LLM to better assist
prediction, thereby improving simulation performance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our LDSim achieves strong results on both the simulation task
and the knowledge tracing (KT) task. Our code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旋转机械故障诊断通常需要大量标注数据，但实际工业应用中数据获取困难且成本高。不同设备具有独特机械特性，需要为每种情况单独训练模型，缺乏泛化能力。

Method: 集成时频域编码器和元学习泛化模型：1）时频域编码器通过随机增强预测状态表示；2）元学习网络进行分类和泛化训练；3）使用少量标注数据进行微调；4）通过少量对比学习迭代优化模型。

Conclusion: MMT-FD框架能够从无标注数据中提取潜在故障表示，具有强泛化能力，适用于各种类型机械设备的故障诊断，且训练效率高。

Abstract: The intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating mechanical equipment usually
requires a large amount of labeled sample data. However, in practical
industrial applications, acquiring enough data is both challenging and
expensive in terms of time and cost. Moreover, different types of rotating
mechanical equipment with different unique mechanical properties, require
separate training of diagnostic models for each case. To address the challenges
of limited fault samples and the lack of generalizability in prediction models
for practical engineering applications, we propose a Multi-Attention Meta
Transformer method for few-shot unsupervised rotating machinery fault diagnosis
(MMT-FD). This framework extracts potential fault representations from
unlabeled data and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, making it
suitable for diagnosing faults across various types of mechanical equipment.
The MMT-FD framework integrates a time-frequency domain encoder and a
meta-learning generalization model. The time-frequency domain encoder predicts
status representations generated through random augmentations in the
time-frequency domain. These enhanced data are then fed into a meta-learning
network for classification and generalization training, followed by fine-tuning
using a limited amount of labeled data. The model is iteratively optimized
using a small number of contrastive learning iterations, resulting in high
efficiency. To validate the framework, we conducted experiments on a bearing
fault dataset and rotor test bench data. The results demonstrate that the
MMT-FD model achieves 99\% fault diagnosis accuracy with only 1\% of labeled
sample data, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.

Motivation: 在长时程任务中，基于大型语言模型的智能体面临稀疏、基于结果的奖励难以分配给中间步骤的挑战。现有方法主要关注创建密集奖励信号，但存在学习动态中的根本问题：策略梯度幅度与熵固有耦合，导致对自信正确动作的更新效率低下，对不确定动作的更新可能不稳定。

Result: 在WebShop、ALFWorld和Deep Search三个具有挑战性的智能体任务上进行全面实验，EMPG实现了显著的性能提升，显著优于强策略梯度基线方法。

Conclusion: EMPG框架有效解决了LLM智能体在长时程任务中的信用分配问题，通过熵调制策略梯度实现了更稳定和高效的学习，在多个任务上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: In long-horizon tasks, recent agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs)
face a significant challenge that sparse, outcome-based rewards make it
difficult to assign credit to intermediate steps. Previous methods mainly focus
on creating dense reward signals to guide learning, either through traditional
reinforcement learning techniques like inverse reinforcement learning or by
using Process Reward Models for step-by-step feedback. In this paper, we
identify a fundamental problem in the learning dynamics of LLMs: the magnitude
of policy gradients is inherently coupled with the entropy, which leads to
inefficient small updates for confident correct actions and potentially
destabilizes large updates for uncertain ones. To resolve this, we propose
Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG), a framework that re-calibrates the
learning signal based on step-wise uncertainty and the final task outcome. EMPG
amplifies updates for confident correct actions, penalizes confident errors,
and attenuates updates from uncertain steps to stabilize exploration. We
further introduce a bonus term for future clarity that encourages agents to
find more predictable solution paths. Through comprehensive experiments on
three challenging agent tasks, WebShop, ALFWorld, and Deep Search, we
demonstrate that EMPG achieves substantial performance gains and significantly
outperforms strong policy gradient baselines. Project page is at

Abstract: Data-driven discovery of emergent dynamics is gaining popularity,
particularly in the context of reaction-diffusion systems. These systems are
widely studied across various fields, including neuroscience, ecology,
epidemiology, and several other subject areas that deal with emergent dynamics.
A current challenge in the discovery process relates to system identification
when there is no prior knowledge of the underlying physics. We attempt to
address this challenge by learning Soft Artificial Life (Soft ALife) models,
such as Agent-based and Cellular Automata (CA) models, from observed data for
reaction-diffusion systems. In this paper, we present findings on the
applicability of a conceptual framework, the Data-driven Rulesets for Soft
Artificial Life (DRSALife) model, to learn Soft ALife rulesets that accurately
represent emergent dynamics in a reaction-diffusion system from observed data.
This model has demonstrated promising results for Elementary CA Rule 30, Game
of Life, and Vicsek Flocking problems in recent work. To our knowledge, this is
one of the few studies that explore machine-based Soft ALife ruleset learning
and system identification for reaction-diffusion dynamics without any prior
knowledge of the underlying physics. Moreover, we provide comprehensive
findings from experiments investigating the potential effects of using noisy
and sparse observed datasets on learning emergent dynamics. Additionally, we
successfully identify the structure and parameters of the underlying partial
differential equations (PDEs) representing these dynamics. Experimental results
demonstrate that the learned models are able to predict the emergent dynamics
with good accuracy (74%) and exhibit quite robust performance when subjected to
Gaussian noise and temporal sparsity.

Conclusion: MoSE提供了灵活且表达力强的子图表示学习框架，在多种图任务中表现出色，同时具有良好的可解释性。

Abstract: While graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in learning
from graph-structured data, their reliance on local, pairwise message passing
restricts their ability to capture complex, high-order subgraph patterns.
leading to insufficient structural expressiveness. Recent efforts have
attempted to enhance structural expressiveness by integrating random walk
kernels into GNNs. However, these methods are inherently designed for
graph-level tasks, which limits their applicability to other downstream tasks
such as node classification. Moreover, their fixed kernel configurations hinder
the model's flexibility in capturing diverse subgraph structures. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Mixture of Subgraph Experts
(MoSE) framework for flexible and expressive subgraph-based representation
learning across diverse graph tasks. Specifically, MoSE extracts informative
subgraphs via anonymous walks and dynamically routes them to specialized
experts based on structural semantics, enabling the model to capture diverse
subgraph patterns with improved flexibility and interpretability. We further
provide a theoretical analysis of MoSE's expressivity within the Subgraph
Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWL) Test, proving that it is more powerful than SWL.
Extensive experiments, together with visualizations of learned subgraph
experts, demonstrate that MoSE not only outperforms competitive baselines but
also provides interpretable insights into structural patterns learned by the
model.

Conclusion: 提出的多项式核方法为HGR相关系数计算提供了更可靠的选择，特别适合实际应用场景中的约束机器学习任务。

Abstract: The Hirschfeld-Gebelein-R\'enyi (HGR) correlation coefficient is an extension
of Pearson's correlation that is not limited to linear correlations, with
potential applications in algorithmic fairness, scientific analysis, and causal
discovery. Recently, novel algorithms to estimate HGR in a differentiable
manner have been proposed to facilitate its use as a loss regularizer in
constrained machine learning applications. However, the inherent
uncomputability of HGR requires a bias-variance trade-off, which can possibly
compromise the robustness of the proposed methods, hence raising technical
concerns if applied in real-world scenarios. We introduce a novel computational
approach for HGR that relies on user-configurable polynomial kernels, offering
greater robustness compared to previous methods and featuring a faster yet
almost equally effective restriction. Our approach provides significant
advantages in terms of robustness and determinism, making it a more reliable
option for real-world applications. Moreover, we present a brief experimental
analysis to validate the applicability of our approach within a constrained
machine learning framework, showing that its computation yields an insightful
subgradient that can serve as a loss regularizer.

Conclusion: MetaLLMiX提供了一个高效、可解释且成本低廉的超参数优化解决方案，在保持精度的同时显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: Effective model and hyperparameter selection remains a major challenge in
deep learning, often requiring extensive expertise and computation. While
AutoML and large language models (LLMs) promise automation, current LLM-based
approaches rely on trial and error and expensive APIs, which provide limited
interpretability and generalizability. We propose MetaLLMiX, a zero-shot

SHAP explanations, MetaLLMiX recommends optimal hyperparameters and pretrained
models without additional trials. We further employ an LLM-as-judge evaluation

medical imaging datasets using nine open-source lightweight LLMs show that
MetaLLMiX achieves competitive or superior performance to traditional HPO
methods while drastically reducing computational cost. Our local deployment
outperforms prior API-based approaches, achieving optimal results on 5 of 8

Motivation: 研究语言模型如何通过自我生成的反事实解释来向人类解释其决策，这对于人机协作至关重要。

Method: 评估LLM生成的反事实解释的有效性（是否达到预期结果）和最小性（修改是否最精简），在多个LLM、数据集和评估设置中进行测试。

Result: LLM通常能生成有效的反事实解释，但远非最小化修改；当要求最小化时，又往往修改过小无法改变预测，存在明显的有效性-最小性权衡。

Conclusion: 自我反事实解释作为可解释性工具效果有限且可能产生误导，在关键决策场景中部署LLM时必须考虑不可靠自我解释对下游决策的影响。

Abstract: To collaborate effectively with humans, language models must be able to
explain their decisions in natural language. We study a specific type of
self-explanation: self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs), where a
model explains its prediction by modifying the input such that it would have
predicted a different outcome. We evaluate whether LLMs can produce SCEs that
are valid, achieving the intended outcome, and minimal, modifying the input no
more than necessary. When asked to generate counterfactuals, we find that LLMs
typically produce SCEs that are valid, but far from minimal, offering little
insight into their decision-making behaviour. Worryingly, when asked to
generate minimal counterfactuals, LLMs typically make excessively small edits
that fail to change predictions. The observed validity-minimality trade-off is
consistent across several LLMs, datasets, and evaluation settings. Our findings
suggest that SCEs are, at best, an ineffective explainability tool and, at
worst, can provide misleading insights into model behaviour. Proposals to
deploy LLMs in high-stakes settings must consider the impact of unreliable
self-explanations on downstream decision-making. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 基于TabPFN模型的Kriging先验回归(KpR)方法，通过空间滞后特征将机器学习与地统统计相结合，在精确农业数字土壤制图中显著提升预测准确性和不确定性估计能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习和地统统计是两种不同的土壤属性预测框架，前者利用环境特征关系，后者利用空间结构。需要开发一种混合方法来结合两者优势

Method: 提出Kriging先验回归(KpR)方法，通过平凡克里金法工程化空间滞后特征，为机器学习模型添加空间上下文。使用TabPFN模型在6个LimeSoDa数据集上评估

Result: KpR方法显著提高了预测准确性，平均R2提升约30%，同时提供了可靠的不确定性估计，表现超过其他空间技术和非空间机器学习算法

Conclusion: KpR与TabPFN组合构成了一个健壁多用的模型框架，特别适用于样本量小的精确农业场景，能够补偿近地感知数据的不足，是数字土壤制图的有效方案

Abstract: Machine learning and geostatistics are two fundamentally different frameworks
for predicting and spatially mapping soil properties. Geostatistics leverages
the spatial structure of soil properties, while machine learning captures the
relationship between available environmental features and soil properties. We
propose a hybrid framework that enriches ML with spatial context through
engineering of 'spatial lag' features from ordinary kriging. We call this
approach 'kriging prior regression' (KpR), as it follows the inverse logic of
regression kriging. To evaluate this approach, we assessed both the point and
probabilistic prediction performance of KpR, using the TabPFN model across six
fieldscale datasets from LimeSoDa. These datasets included soil organic carbon,
clay content, and pH, along with features derived from remote sensing and
in-situ proximal soil sensing. KpR with TabPFN demonstrated reliable
uncertainty estimates and more accurate predictions in comparison to several
other spatial techniques (e.g., regression/residual kriging with TabPFN), as
well as to established non-spatial machine learning algorithms (e.g., random
forest). Most notably, it significantly improved the average R2 by around 30%
compared to machine learning algorithms without spatial context. This
improvement was due to the strong prediction performance of the TabPFN
algorithm itself and the complementary spatial information provided by KpR
features. TabPFN is particularly effective for prediction tasks with small
sample sizes, common in precision agriculture, whereas KpR can compensate for
weak relationships between sensing features and soil properties when proximal
soil sensing data are limited. Hence, we conclude that KpR with TabPFN is a
very robust and versatile modelling framework for digital soil mapping in
precision agriculture.

Abstract: Co-occurrence network inference algorithms have significantly advanced our
understanding of microbiome communities. However, these algorithms typically
analyze microbial associations within samples collected from a single
environmental niche, often capturing only static snapshots rather than dynamic
microbial processes. Previous studies have commonly grouped samples from
different environmental niches together without fully considering how microbial
communities adapt their associations when faced with varying ecological
conditions. Our study addresses this limitation by explicitly investigating
both spatial and temporal dynamics of microbial communities. We analyzed
publicly available microbiome abundance data across multiple locations and time
points, to evaluate algorithm performance in predicting microbial associations
using our proposed Same-All Cross-validation (SAC) framework. SAC evaluates
algorithms in two distinct scenarios: training and testing within the same
environmental niche (Same), and training and testing on combined data from
multiple environmental niches (All). To overcome the limitations of
conventional algorithms, we propose fuser, an algorithm that, while not
entirely new in machine learning, is novel for microbiome community network
inference. It retains subsample-specific signals while simultaneously sharing
relevant information across environments during training. Unlike standard
approaches that infer a single generalized network from combined data, fuser
generates distinct, environment-specific predictive networks. Our results
demonstrate that fuser achieves comparable predictive performance to existing
algorithms such as glmnet when evaluated within homogeneous environments
(Same), and notably reduces test error compared to baseline algorithms in
cross-environment (All) scenarios.

TL;DR: CSGD模型通过concrete scores将score matching扩展到离散图生成，提出Composable Guidance和Probability Calibration技术，在分子图生成中实现了15.3%的controllability提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图扩散模型在多条件设置下效果有限，依赖联合条件或连续松弛会损害保真度，需要解决分子图生成中的多属性约束问题

Method: 提出CSGD模型，基于concrete scores实现离散图的score matching；引入Composable Guidance实现细粒度条件控制，以及Probability Calibration调整转移概率缓解训练-测试不匹配

Result: 在四个分子数据集上达到SOTA性能，controllability平均提升15.3%，同时保持高有效性和分布保真度

Conclusion: 基于score的建模在离散图生成中具有实际优势，能够实现灵活的多属性分子设计

Abstract: Controllable molecular graph generation is essential for material and drug
discovery, where generated molecules must satisfy diverse property constraints.
While recent advances in graph diffusion models have improved generation
quality, their effectiveness in multi-conditional settings remains limited due
to reliance on joint conditioning or continuous relaxations that compromise
fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose Composable Score-based Graph
Diffusion model (CSGD), the first model that extends score matching to discrete
graphs via concrete scores, enabling flexible and principled manipulation of
conditional guidance. Building on this foundation, we introduce two score-based
techniques: Composable Guidance (CoG), which allows fine-grained control over
arbitrary subsets of conditions during sampling, and Probability Calibration
(PC), which adjusts estimated transition probabilities to mitigate train-test
mismatches. Empirical results on four molecular datasets show that CSGD
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 15.3% average improvement in
controllability over prior methods, while maintaining high validity and
distributional fidelity. Our findings highlight the practical advantages of
score-based modeling for discrete graph generation and its capacity for
flexible, multi-property molecular design.

Conclusion: AquaCast模型能够有效处理城市水动力预测问题，在真实和合成数据上均表现出优越的性能和良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of forecasting urban water dynamics by
developing a multi-input, multi-output deep learning model that incorporates
both endogenous variables (e.g., water height or discharge) and exogenous
factors (e.g., precipitation history and forecast reports). Unlike conventional
forecasting, the proposed model, AquaCast, captures both inter-variable and
temporal dependencies across all inputs, while focusing forecast solely on
endogenous variables. Exogenous inputs are fused via an embedding layer,
eliminating the need to forecast them and enabling the model to attend to their
short-term influences more effectively. We evaluate our approach on the
LausanneCity dataset, which includes measurements from four urban drainage
sensors, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance when using only
endogenous variables. Performance also improves with the inclusion of exogenous
variables and forecast reports. To assess generalization and scalability, we
additionally test the model on three large-scale synthesized datasets,
generated from MeteoSwiss records, the Lorenz Attractors model, and the Random
Fields model, each representing a different level of temporal complexity across
100 nodes. The results confirm that our model consistently outperforms existing
baselines and maintains a robust and accurate forecast across both real and
synthetic datasets.

Motivation: 现有DPSGD的静态噪声机制影响模型性能，且随着模型参数指数增长，随机优化器的学习效率面临挑战

Result: 在不同目标函数上表现出可证明的次线性收敛率，匹配最佳可用率，实验显示在保持隐私的同时显著提高准确率

Conclusion: 动态差分隐私以隐私为代价带来更好效用，随机投影实现更高效的模型学习

Abstract: Stochastic optimization is a pivotal enabler in modern machine learning,
producing effective models for various tasks. However, several existing works
have shown that model parameters and gradient information are susceptible to
privacy leakage. Although Differentially Private SGD (DPSGD) addresses privacy
concerns, its static noise mechanism impacts the error bounds for model
performance. Additionally, with the exponential increase in model parameters,
efficient learning of these models using stochastic optimizers has become more
challenging. To address these concerns, we introduce the Dynamically
Differentially Private Projected SGD (D2P2-SGD) optimizer. In D2P2-SGD, we
combine two important ideas: (i) dynamic differential privacy (DDP) with
automatic gradient clipping and (ii) random projection with SGD, allowing
dynamic adjustment of the tradeoff between utility and privacy of the model. It
exhibits provably sub-linear convergence rates across different objective
functions, matching the best available rate. The theoretical analysis further
suggests that DDP leads to better utility at the cost of privacy, while random
projection enables more efficient model learning. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets show that D2P2-SGD remarkably enhances accuracy while
maintaining privacy. Our code is available here.

Abstract: Solutions to the Algorithm Selection Problem (ASP) in machine learning face
the challenge of high computational costs associated with evaluating various
algorithms' performances on a given dataset. To mitigate this cost, the
meta-learning field can leverage previously executed experiments shared in
online repositories such as OpenML. OpenML provides an extensive collection of
machine learning experiments. However, an analysis of OpenML's records reveals
limitations. It lacks diversity in pipelines, specifically when exploring data
preprocessing steps/blocks, such as scaling or imputation, resulting in limited
representation. Its experiments are often focused on a few popular techniques
within each pipeline block, leading to an imbalanced sample. To overcome the
observed limitations of OpenML, we propose PIPES, a collection of experiments
involving multiple pipelines designed to represent all combinations of the
selected sets of techniques, aiming at diversity and completeness. PIPES stores
the results of experiments performed applying 9,408 pipelines to 300 datasets.
It includes detailed information on the pipeline blocks, training and testing
times, predictions, performances, and the eventual error messages. This
comprehensive collection of results allows researchers to perform analyses
across diverse and representative pipelines and datasets. PIPES also offers
potential for expansion, as additional data and experiments can be incorporated
to support the meta-learning community further. The data, code, supplementary

Conclusion: 少样本学习在医疗诊断领域具有可行性，特别是在标签数据有限时，多分类分类模型与二元分类模型表现相似。

Abstract: This paper investigates the effectiveness of few-shot learning for
respiratory sound classification, focusing on coughbased detection of COVID-19,
Flu, and healthy conditions. We leverage Prototypical Networks with spectrogram
representations of cough sounds to address the challenge of limited labeled
data. Our study evaluates whether few-shot learning can enable models to
achieve performance comparable to traditional deep learning approaches while
using significantly fewer training samples. Additionally, we compare
multi-class and binary classification models to assess whether multi-class
models can perform comparably to their binary counterparts. Experimental
findings show that few-shot learning models can achieve competitive accuracy.
Our model attains 74.87% accuracy in multi-class classification with only 15
support examples per class, while binary classification achieves over 70%
accuracy across all class pairs. Class-wise analysis reveals Flu as the most
distinguishable class, and Healthy as the most challenging. Statistical tests
(paired t-test p = 0.149, Wilcoxon p = 0.125) indicate no significant
performance difference between binary and multiclass models, supporting the
viability of multi-class classification in this setting. These results
highlight the feasibility of applying few-shot learning in medical diagnostics,
particularly when large labeled datasets are unavailable.

Result: 在多种场景下优于现有防御方法，特别是在非IID数据分布时，其他防御机制失效时ProDiGy仍能保持强大的防御能力和模型精度

Conclusion: 双视角方法在促进诚实客户端自然相似性的同时检测可疑一致性，是有效的防御策略

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a widely studied paradigm for distributed
learning. Despite its many advantages, FL remains vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, especially under data heterogeneity. We propose a new Byzantine-robust
FL algorithm called ProDiGy. The key novelty lies in evaluating the client
gradients using a joint dual scoring system based on the gradients' proximity
and dissimilarity. We demonstrate through extensive numerical experiments that
ProDiGy outperforms existing defenses in various scenarios. In particular, when
the clients' data do not follow an IID distribution, while other defense
mechanisms fail, ProDiGy maintains strong defense capabilities and model
accuracy. These findings highlight the effectiveness of a dual perspective
approach that promotes natural similarity among honest clients while detecting
suspicious uniformity as a potential indicator of an attack.

Abstract: Graph alignment-the problem of identifying corresponding nodes across
multiple graphs-is fundamental to numerous applications. Most existing
unsupervised methods embed node features into latent representations to enable
cross-graph comparison without ground-truth correspondences. However, these
methods suffer from two critical limitations: the degradation of node
distinctiveness due to oversmoothing in GNN-based embeddings, and the
misalignment of latent spaces across graphs caused by structural noise, feature
heterogeneity, and training instability, ultimately leading to unreliable node
correspondences. We propose a novel graph alignment framework that
simultaneously enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency
across latent spaces. Our approach introduces a dual-pass encoder that combines
low-pass and high-pass spectral filters to generate embeddings that are both
structure-aware and highly discriminative. To address latent space
misalignment, we incorporate a geometry-aware functional map module that learns
bijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings, ensuring
consistent geometric relationships across different representations. Extensive
experiments on graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines, exhibiting superior
robustness to structural inconsistencies and challenging alignment scenarios.
Additionally, comprehensive evaluation on vision-language benchmarks using
diverse pretrained models shows that our framework effectively generalizes
beyond graph domains, enabling unsupervised alignment of vision and language
representations.

Abstract: We present a deep learning emulator for stochastic and chaotic
spatio-temporal systems, explicitly conditioned on the parameter values of the
underlying partial differential equations (PDEs). Our approach involves
pre-training the model on a single parameter domain, followed by fine-tuning on
a smaller, yet diverse dataset, enabling generalisation across a broad range of
parameter values. By incorporating local attention mechanisms, the network is
capable of handling varying domain sizes and resolutions. This enables
computationally efficient pre-training on smaller domains while requiring only
a small additional dataset to learn how to generalise to larger domain sizes.
We demonstrate the model's capabilities on the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
equation and stochastically-forced beta-plane turbulence, showcasing its
ability to capture phenomena at interpolated parameter values. The emulator
provides significant computational speed-ups over conventional numerical
integration, facilitating efficient exploration of parameter space, while a
probabilistic variant of the emulator provides uncertainty quantification,
allowing for the statistical study of rare events.

Conclusion: 这种整体视角允许更全面的漂移诊断，能够区分不同的根本原因，如空间数据漂移与概念重新标记

Abstract: Machine learning models in dynamic environments often suffer from concept
drift, where changes in the data distribution degrade performance. While
detecting this drift is a well-studied topic, explaining how and why the
model's decision-making logic changes still remains a significant challenge. In
this paper, we introduce a novel methodology to explain concept drift by
analyzing the temporal evolution of group-based counterfactual explanations
(GCEs). Our approach tracks shifts in the GCEs' cluster centroids and their
associated counterfactual action vectors before and after a drift. These
evolving GCEs act as an interpretable proxy, revealing structural changes in
the model's decision boundary and its underlying rationale. We operationalize
this analysis within a three-layer framework that synergistically combines
insights from the data layer (distributional shifts), the model layer
(prediction disagreement), and our proposed explanation layer. We show that
such holistic view allows for a more comprehensive diagnosis of drift, making
it possible to distinguish between different root causes, such as a spatial
data shift versus a re-labeling of concepts.

TL;DR: ButterflyQuant提出可学习的蝴蝶变换替代固定Hadamard旋转，通过连续Givens旋转角度参数化，实现层自适应的激活值异常值抑制，在2-bit量化下显著提升LLaMA-2-7B性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有旋转方法使用固定变换无法适应不同Transformer层的独特异常值模式，需要层自适应的旋转方法而非一刀切方案。

Method: 使用可学习的蝴蝶变换替代Hadamard矩阵，通过连续Givens旋转角度参数化保证正交性，同时引入均匀性正则化促进量化友好的平滑分布。

Result: 在LLaMA-2-7B的2-bit量化中，ButterflyQuant达到15.4的困惑度，优于QuaRot的22.1，仅需128个校准样本和单GPU几分钟训练。

Conclusion: ButterflyQuant通过可学习的正交变换有效抑制激活值异常值，在极低比特量化下保持模型性能，计算效率高且训练成本低。

Abstract: Large language models require massive memory footprints, severely limiting
deployment on consumer hardware. Quantization reduces memory through lower
numerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic
performance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as
QuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before
quantization, using computational invariance: $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Wx} =
(\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\mathbf{Q}$. However, these
methods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case
coherence $\mu = 1/\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight
distributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct
outlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than
one-size-fits-all approaches. We propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces
Hadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by
continuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\{+1, -1\}$
entries that are non-differentiable and prohibit gradient-based learning,
butterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization
while guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint
ensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \log
n)$ computational complexity with only $\frac{n \log n}{2}$ learnable
parameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on
post-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to
quantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in
minutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. On LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit
quantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 22.1 for QuaRot.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction using deep learning (DL) models has accelerated
drug and materials discovery, but the resulting DL models often lack
interpretability, hindering their adoption by chemists. This work proposes
developing molecule representations using the concept of Functional Groups (FG)
in chemistry. We introduce the Functional Group Representation (FGR) framework,
a novel approach to encoding molecules based on their fundamental chemical
substructures. Our method integrates two types of functional groups: those
curated from established chemical knowledge (FG), and those mined from a large
molecular corpus using sequential pattern mining (MFG). The resulting FGR
framework encodes molecules into a lower-dimensional latent space by leveraging
pre-training on a large dataset of unlabeled molecules. Furthermore, the
proposed framework allows the inclusion of 2D structure-based descriptors of
molecules. We demonstrate that the FGR framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance on a diverse range of 33 benchmark datasets spanning physical
chemistry, biophysics, quantum mechanics, biological activity, and
pharmacokinetics while enabling chemical interpretability. Crucially, the
model's representations are intrinsically aligned with established chemical
principles, allowing chemists to directly link predicted properties to specific
functional groups and facilitating novel insights into structure-property
relationships. Our work presents a significant step toward developing
high-performing, chemically interpretable DL models for molecular discovery.

TL;DR: FG-FARL是一种离线强化学习方法，通过校准各组的安阈值来减少伤害，同时在受保护子组间均衡公平目标（覆盖率或伤害）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决离线强化学习中的安全问题，减少对受保护子组的伤害，同时确保决策支持的公平性。

Method: 使用可行性引导的公平自适应强化学习（FG-FARL），校准每组的安阈值，并与行为克隆（BC）和HACO基线进行比较。

Result: FG-FARL在保持与基线相当的价值的同时，改善了公平性指标，提供了更安全、更公平的决策支持。

Conclusion: FG-FARL展示了实现更安全和更公平决策支持的实用路径，特别是在医疗补助人群健康管理项目中。

Abstract: We introduce Feasibility-Guided Fair Adaptive Reinforcement Learning
(FG-FARL), an offline RL procedure that calibrates per-group safety thresholds
to reduce harm while equalizing a chosen fairness target (coverage or harm)
across protected subgroups. Using de-identified longitudinal trajectories from
a Medicaid population health management program, we evaluate FG-FARL against
behavior cloning (BC) and HACO (Hybrid Adaptive Conformal Offline RL; a global
conformal safety baseline). We report off-policy value estimates with bootstrap
95% confidence intervals and subgroup disparity analyses with p-values. FG-FARL
achieves comparable value to baselines while improving fairness metrics,
demonstrating a practical path to safer and more equitable decision support.

*Shangqing Shi,Luoxiao Zhang,Yuchen Yin,Xiong Yang,Hoileong Lee*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: MRIME-CD算法通过协方差学习、平均引导和随机协方差学习策略改进RIME算法，解决了种群多样性快速丧失和易陷入局部最优的问题，在精度、收敛速度和稳定性方面表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RIME算法在优化过程中种群多样性快速丧失，容易陷入局部最优，导致开发和探索能力不平衡，需要改进这些缺陷

Method: 提出MRIME-CD算法，采用三种策略：1）软霜搜索阶段引入协方差学习策略；2）硬霜穿刺机制中加入平均引导策略；3）提出新的停滞指标和随机协方差学习策略更新停滞个体

Result: 在CEC2017和CEC2022测试集上验证，通过Friedman检验、Wilcoxon秩和检验和Kruskal Wallis检验分析，结果显示MRIME-CD能有效提升基础RIME性能

Conclusion: MRIME-CD算法在解精度、收敛速度和稳定性方面具有明显优势，能够有效跳出局部最优解，增强全局搜索能力

Abstract: Metaheuristics are widely applied for their ability to provide more efficient
solutions. The RIME algorithm is a recently proposed physical-based
metaheuristic algorithm with certain advantages. However, it suffers from rapid
loss of population diversity during optimization and is prone to fall into
local optima, leading to unbalanced exploitation and exploration. To address
the shortcomings of RIME, this paper proposes a modified RIME with covariance
learning and diversity enhancement (MRIME-CD). The algorithm applies three
strategies to improve the optimization capability. First, a covariance learning
strategy is introduced in the soft-rime search stage to increase the population
diversity and balance the over-exploitation ability of RIME through the
bootstrapping effect of dominant populations. Second, in order to moderate the
tendency of RIME population to approach the optimal individual in the early
search stage, an average bootstrapping strategy is introduced into the
hard-rime puncture mechanism, which guides the population search through the
weighted position of the dominant populations, thus enhancing the global search
ability of RIME in the early stage. Finally, a new stagnation indicator is
proposed, and a stochastic covariance learning strategy is used to update the
stagnant individuals in the population when the algorithm gets stagnant, thus
enhancing the ability to jump out of the local optimal solution. The proposed
MRIME-CD algorithm is subjected to a series of validations on the CEC2017 test
set, the CEC2022 test set, and the experimental results are analyzed using the
Friedman test, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, and the Kruskal Wallis test. The
results show that MRIME-CD can effectively improve the performance of basic
RIME and has obvious superiorities in terms of solution accuracy, convergence
speed and stability.

*Baoqi Zhao,Xiong Yang,Hoileong Lee,Bowen Dong*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的教育竞争优化算法IECO-MCO，通过多协方差学习算子解决原始ECO算法在开发和探索之间不平衡的问题，提高了收敛速度和避免局部最优的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始教育竞争优化算法(ECO)存在开发和探索不平衡的问题，容易陷入局部最优，在处理复杂优化问题时效果有限。

Method: 引入了三种不同的协方差学习算子来改进ECO算法，每个算子都能有效平衡开发和探索，防止种群过早收敛。

Result: 在CEC 2017和CEC 2022测试集上的实验表明，IECO-MCO在收敛速度、稳定性和避免局部最优方面优于基础ECO和其他竞争算法，平均排名分别为2.213和2.488。

Conclusion: IECO-MCO算法在解决复杂优化问题时表现出优越性能，证明了其在现实世界场景中的鲁棒性和实际有效性。

Abstract: The educational competition optimizer is a recently introduced metaheuristic
algorithm inspired by human behavior, originating from the dynamics of
educational competition within society. Nonetheless, ECO faces constraints due
to an imbalance between exploitation and exploration, rendering it susceptible
to local optima and demonstrating restricted effectiveness in addressing
complex optimization problems. To address these limitations, this study
presents an enhanced educational competition optimizer (IECO-MCO) utilizing
multi-covariance learning operators. In IECO, three distinct covariance
learning operators are introduced to improve the performance of ECO. Each
operator effectively balances exploitation and exploration while preventing
premature convergence of the population. The effectiveness of IECO is assessed
through benchmark functions derived from the CEC 2017 and CEC 2022 test suites,
and its performance is compared with various basic and improved algorithms
across different categories. The results demonstrate that IECO-MCO surpasses
the basic ECO and other competing algorithms in convergence speed, stability,
and the capability to avoid local optima. Furthermore, statistical analyses,
including the Friedman test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test,
are conducted to validate the superiority of IECO-MCO over the compared
algorithms. Compared with the basic algorithm (improved algorithm), IECO-MCO
achieved an average ranking of 2.213 (2.488) on the CE2017 and CEC2022 test
suites. Additionally, the practical applicability of the proposed IECO-MCO
algorithm is verified by solving constrained optimization problems. The
experimental outcomes demonstrate the superior performance of IECO-MCO in
tackling intricate optimization problems, underscoring its robustness and
practical effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: PerFairX框架评估LLM推荐系统中个性化与公平性的权衡，发现基于人格的提示能提升心理契合度但加剧人口统计公平性差距


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推荐系统中实现了基于人格的零样本个性化，但人格特质整合（OCEAN模型）引发了心理对齐与人口统计公平性之间的紧张关系

Method: 提出PerFairX评估框架，使用中性和人格敏感提示，在MovieLens和Last.fm数据集上对ChatGPT和DeepSeek进行基准测试

Result: 人格感知提示显著改善个体特质对齐但加剧群体公平性差距；DeepSeek心理契合度更强但对提示变化更敏感；ChatGPT输出稳定但个性化程度较低

Conclusion: PerFairX为开发既公平又心理感知的LLM推荐系统提供原则性基准，有助于在持续学习环境中创建包容性、以用户为中心的AI应用

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into recommender systems has
enabled zero-shot, personality-based personalization through prompt-based
interactions, offering a new paradigm for user-centric recommendations.
However, incorporating user personality traits via the OCEAN model highlights a
critical tension between achieving psychological alignment and ensuring
demographic fairness. To address this, we propose PerFairX, a unified
evaluation framework designed to quantify the trade-offs between
personalization and demographic equity in LLM-generated recommendations. Using
neutral and personality-sensitive prompts across diverse user profiles, we
benchmark two state-of-the-art LLMs, ChatGPT and DeepSeek, on movie (MovieLens
10M) and music (Last.fm 360K) datasets. Our results reveal that
personality-aware prompting significantly improves alignment with individual
traits but can exacerbate fairness disparities across demographic groups.
Specifically, DeepSeek achieves stronger psychological fit but exhibits higher
sensitivity to prompt variations, while ChatGPT delivers stable yet less
personalized outputs. PerFairX provides a principled benchmark to guide the
development of LLM-based recommender systems that are both equitable and
psychologically informed, contributing to the creation of inclusive,
user-centric AI applications in continual learning contexts.

TL;DR: 论文分析了大数据分析和AI中的黑盒问题如何加剧隐私威胁，提出了三种不透明性分类，并指出这些不透明性使得保护隐私所需的判断无法实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大数据分析和AI中的黑盒问题对隐私保护的负面影响，特别是在判断和行动正当性方面的挑战。

Method: 通过概念分析区分三种不透明性类型：浅层不透明性（主体不知道系统做什么）、标准黑盒不透明性（分析师不知道系统做什么）和深度不透明性（分析师不可能知道系统可能做什么）。

Result: 发现在不透明性条件下，数据主体和分析专家都无法提供保护隐私所需的正当性判断，如无法获得"知情同意"或保证"匿名性"。

Conclusion: 大数据分析加剧了隐私问题并使补救措施效果降低，但文章最后对技术解决方案提供了简要展望。

Abstract: It is known that big data analytics and AI pose a threat to privacy, and that
some of this is due to some kind of "black box problem" in AI. I explain how
this becomes a problem in the context of justification for judgments and
actions. Furthermore, I suggest distinguishing three kinds of opacity: 1) the
subjects do not know what the system does ("shallow opacity"), 2) the analysts
do not know what the system does ("standard black box opacity"), or 3) the
analysts cannot possibly know what the system might do ("deep opacity"). If the
agents, data subjects as well as analytics experts, operate under opacity, then
these agents cannot provide justifications for judgments that are necessary to
protect privacy, e.g., they cannot give "informed consent", or guarantee
"anonymity". It follows from these points that agents in big data analytics and
AI often cannot make the judgments needed to protect privacy. So I conclude
that big data analytics makes the privacy problems worse and the remedies less
effective. As a positive note, I provide a brief outlook on technical ways to
handle this situation.

Abstract: There is an increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in safety-critical
applications, yet practical schemes for certifying that AI systems are safe,
lawful and socially acceptable remain scarce. This white paper presents the
T\"UV AUSTRIA Trusted AI framework an end-to-end audit catalog and methodology
for assessing and certifying machine learning systems. The audit catalog has
been in continuous development since 2019 in an ongoing collaboration with
scientific partners. Building on three pillars - Secure Software Development,
Functional Requirements, and Ethics & Data Privacy - the catalog translates the
high-level obligations of the EU AI Act into specific, testable criteria. Its
core concept of functional trustworthiness couples a statistically defined
application domain with risk-based minimum performance requirements and
statistical testing on independently sampled data, providing transparent and
reproducible evidence of model quality in real-world settings. We provide an
overview of the functional requirements that we assess, which are oriented on
the lifecycle of an AI system. In addition, we share some lessons learned from
the practical application of the audit catalog, highlighting common pitfalls we
encountered, such as data leakage scenarios, inadequate domain definitions,
neglect of biases, or a lack of distribution drift controls. We further discuss
key aspects of certifying AI systems, such as robustness, algorithmic fairness,
or post-certification requirements, outlining both our current conclusions and
a roadmap for future research. In general, by aligning technical best practices
with emerging European standards, the approach offers regulators, providers,
and users a practical roadmap for legally compliant, functionally trustworthy,
and certifiable AI systems.

TL;DR: 本文报告了一个使用自然语言与AI协作开发软件应用的vibe coding方法在EFL教育中的实践研究，提出了人工智能元语言框架，并通过对比案例分析揭示了学生在提示工程、作者权和AI心智模型方面的差异对编码效果的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过人工智能协作的方式来改善英语作为外语的教育，并研究学生在使用AI工具时的语言交互经验和学习效果。

Method: 采用案例研究方法，设计了四小时的工作坊，通过逆向设计原则让学生设计解决EFL写作挑战的应用程序。数据收集包括工作表、视频录音、出声思考协议、屏幕录制和AI生成图像。

Result: 对比案例显示：一名学生成功开发出符合设计意图的功能性应用，而另一名学生遇到技术困难且实际功能与预期差距较大。分析发现学生在提示工程方法、AI心智模型和作者权归属方面存在显著差异。

Conclusion: AI作为有益的语言机器，学生如何与AI交互（调试、协作、理解）影响vibe coding的成效。有效的vibe coding教学需要明确的元语言脚手架、结构化提示工程教学、作者权讨论和AI心智模型表达能力的培养。

Abstract: This innovative practice article reports on the piloting of vibe coding
(using natural language to create software applications with AI) for English as
a Foreign Language (EFL) education. We developed a human-AI meta-languaging
framework with three dimensions: talking to AI (prompt engineering), talking
through AI (negotiating authorship), and talking about AI (mental models of
AI). Using backward design principles, we created a four-hour workshop where
two students designed applications addressing authentic EFL writing challenges.
We adopted a case study methodology, collecting data from worksheets and video
recordings, think-aloud protocols, screen recordings, and AI-generated images.
Contrasting cases showed one student successfully vibe coding a functional
application cohering to her intended design, while another encountered
technical difficulties with major gaps between intended design and actual
functionality. Analysis reveals differences in students' prompt engineering
approaches, suggesting different AI mental models and tensions in attributing
authorship. We argue that AI functions as a beneficial languaging machine, and
that differences in how students talk to, through, and about AI explain vibe
coding outcome variations. Findings indicate that effective vibe coding
instruction requires explicit meta-languaging scaffolding, teaching structured
prompt engineering, facilitating critical authorship discussions, and
developing vocabulary for articulating AI mental models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大学在非工作时间缺乏学术支持的问题，利用LLM为学生提供灵活及时的教学支持。

Method: 在三所机构的六门计算机科学课程中部署LLM课程助手系统，收集并2000名学生的交互数据，对每门课程200个对话进行手动标注分析。

Result: 系统在晚上和夜间使用率高，初级课程使用更活跃。大部分回复准确有用，但只有少数包含专门示例；仅11%对话包含LLM生成的追踪问题，高级课程学生常忽略这些问题。LLM在生成高阶认知问题方面能力有限。

Conclusion: LLM教育系统有潜力补充学术支持空白，但需要教育者更多参与策略设计、内容配置和政策制定，以提升教学效果。

Abstract: Providing students with flexible and timely academic support is a challenge
at most colleges and universities, leaving many students without help outside
scheduled hours. Large language models (LLMs) are promising for bridging this
gap, but interactions between students and LLMs are rarely overseen by
educators. We developed and studied an LLM-powered course assistant deployed
across multiple computer science courses to characterize real-world use and
understand pedagogical implications. By Spring 2024, our system had been
deployed to approximately 2,000 students across six courses at three
institutions. Analysis of the interaction data shows that usage remains strong
in the evenings and nights and is higher in introductory courses, indicating
that our system helps address temporal support gaps and novice learner needs.
We sampled 200 conversations per course for manual annotation: most sampled
responses were judged correct and helpful, with a small share unhelpful or
erroneous; few responses included dedicated examples. We also examined an
inquiry-based learning strategy: only around 11% of sampled conversations
contained LLM-generated follow-up questions, which were often ignored by
students in advanced courses. A Bloom's taxonomy analysis reveals that current
LLM capabilities are limited in generating higher-order cognitive questions.
These patterns suggest opportunities for pedagogically oriented LLM-based
educational systems and greater educator involvement in configuring prompts,
content, and policies.

Motivation: 当前LLM对齐技术主要反映小范围参考组的规范偏好，强加其价值观给广大用户，导致知识生产和管理权力向影响力机构集中

Method: 提出以下三个特征来实现去中心化对齐：1）语境性：根据具体使用场景定制对齐策略；2）多元性：包容不同价值观和偏好；3）参与性：让更广泛的群体参与对齐过程

Result: 通过具体使用案例展示了上述特征的实践方法，证明了在不同使用语境下应用对齐技术的细致要求

Conclusion: LLM对齐可作为抵抗认知不公和民主过程涅变的潜在场域，但这些策略无法替代更广泛的社会变革

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) alignment methods have been credited with the
commercial success of products like ChatGPT, given their role in steering LLMs
towards user-friendly outputs. However, current alignment techniques
predominantly mirror the normative preferences of a narrow reference group,
effectively imposing their values on a wide user base. Drawing on theories of
the power/knowledge nexus, this work argues that current alignment practices
centralise control over knowledge production and governance within already
influential institutions. To counter this, we propose decentralising alignment
through three characteristics: context, pluralism, and participation.
Furthermore, this paper demonstrates the critical importance of delineating the
context-of-use when shaping alignment practices by grounding each of these
features in concrete use cases. This work makes the following contributions:
(1) highlighting the role of context, pluralism, and participation in
decentralising alignment; (2) providing concrete examples to illustrate these
strategies; and (3) demonstrating the nuanced requirements associated with
applying alignment across different contexts of use. Ultimately, this paper
positions LLM alignment as a potential site of resistance against epistemic
injustice and the erosion of democratic processes, while acknowledging that
these strategies alone cannot substitute for broader societal changes.

Motivation: 人工智能在通信领域的集成带来了算法偏见和系统行为不可预测等新风险，这些风险超出了传统网络安全和数据保护框架的范围，需要被认为独立的监管关注点。

Method: 通过定义通信AI事故类型学，并以印度为案例研究，分析其主要数字规定（包括《通信法案2023》、CERT-In规则和《数字个人数据保护法》），识别监管缺口。

Result: 研究发现印度现有法律体系主要关注网络安全和数据泄漏，在AI特有运营事故（如性能降级、算法偏见）方面存在重大监管缺口。同时识别了事故报告的结构性障碍和现有AI事故库的限制。

Conclusion: 论文提出了针对性政策建议，包括强制报告高风险AI故障、指定环节机构管理事故数据、开发标准化报告框架。这些建议能够在现有通信治理体系内增强监管明确性和长期弹性，为其他国家控制AI风险提供可复制的蓝图。

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into telecommunications
infrastructure introduces novel risks, such as algorithmic bias and
unpredictable system behavior, that fall outside the scope of traditional
cybersecurity and data protection frameworks. This paper introduces a precise
definition and a detailed typology of telecommunications AI incidents,
establishing them as a distinct category of risk that extends beyond
conventional cybersecurity and data protection breaches. It argues for their
recognition as a distinct regulatory concern. Using India as a case study for
jurisdictions that lack a horizontal AI law, the paper analyzes the country's
key digital regulations. The analysis reveals that India's existing legal
instruments, including the Telecommunications Act, 2023, the CERT-In Rules, and
the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, focus on cybersecurity and data
breaches, creating a significant regulatory gap for AI-specific operational
incidents, such as performance degradation and algorithmic bias. The paper also
examines structural barriers to disclosure and the limitations of existing AI
incident repositories. Based on these findings, the paper proposes targeted
policy recommendations centered on integrating AI incident reporting into
India's existing telecom governance. Key proposals include mandating reporting
for high-risk AI failures, designating an existing government body as a nodal
agency to manage incident data, and developing standardized reporting
frameworks. These recommendations aim to enhance regulatory clarity and
strengthen long-term resilience, offering a pragmatic and replicable blueprint
for other nations seeking to govern AI risks within their existing sectoral
frameworks.

Method: 使用常数深度的ReLU^{k-1}网络，通过控制权重范围来控制泛化错误，实现对Sobolev空间函数的同时近似。

Conclusion: 该方法为曲面上学习偏微分方程提供了理论基础，网络架构利用稀疏结构高效利用低维几何特性。

Abstract: A key challenge in scientific machine learning is solving partial
differential equations (PDEs) on complex domains, where the curved geometry
complicates the approximation of functions and their derivatives required by
differential operators. This paper establishes the first simultaneous
approximation theory for deep neural networks on manifolds. We prove that a
constant-depth $\mathrm{ReLU}^{k-1}$ network with bounded weights--a property
that plays a crucial role in controlling generalization error--can approximate
any function in the Sobolev space $\mathcal{W}_p^{k}(\mathcal{M}^d)$ to an
error of $\varepsilon$ in the $\mathcal{W}_p^{s}(\mathcal{M}^d)$ norm, for
$k\geq 3$ and $s<k$, using $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-d/(k-s)})$ nonzero
parameters, a rate that overcomes the curse of dimensionality by depending only
on the intrinsic dimension $d$. These results readily extend to functions in
H\"older-Zygmund spaces. We complement this result with a matching lower bound,
proving our construction is nearly optimal by showing the required number of
parameters matches up to a logarithmic factor. Our proof of the lower bound
introduces novel estimates for the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension and
pseudo-dimension of the network's high-order derivative classes. These
complexity bounds provide a theoretical cornerstone for learning PDEs on
manifolds involving derivatives. Our analysis reveals that the network
architecture leverages a sparse structure to efficiently exploit the manifold's
low-dimensional geometry.

Conclusion: 通过引入辅助神经网络问题和相应的离散化方法，成功解决了无限维全变分最小化问题的神经网络求解理论难题，为相关应用提供了理论基础和计算方法。

Abstract: Neural network approaches have been demonstrated to work quite well to solve
partial differential equations in practice. In this context approaches like
physics-informed neural networks and the Deep Ritz method have become popular.
In this paper, we propose a similar approach to solve an infinite-dimensional
total variation minimization problem using neural networks. We illustrate that
the resulting neural network problem does not have a solution in general. To
circumvent this theoretic issue, we consider an auxiliary neural network
problem, which indeed has a solution, and show that it converges in the sense
of $\Gamma$-convergence to the original problem. For computing a numerical
solution we further propose a discrete version of the auxiliary neural network
problem and again show its $\Gamma$-convergence to the original
infinite-dimensional problem. In particular, the $\Gamma$-convergence proof
suggests a particular discretization of the total variation. Moreover, we
connect the discrete neural network problem to a finite difference
discretization of the infinite-dimensional total variation minimization
problem. Numerical experiments are presented supporting our theoretical
findings.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of
deep learning models over relational databases, including architectures based
on heterogeneous graph neural networks (hetero-GNNs) and heterogeneous graph
transformers. In effect, such architectures state how the database records and
links (e.g., foreign-key references) translate into a large, complex numerical
expression, involving numerous learnable parameters. This complexity makes it
hard to explain, in human-understandable terms, how a model uses the available
data to arrive at a given prediction. We present a novel framework for
explaining machine-learning models over relational databases, where
explanations are view definitions that highlight focused parts of the database
that mostly contribute to the model's prediction. We establish such global
abductive explanations by adapting the classic notion of determinacy by Nash,
Segoufin, and Vianu (2010). In addition to tuning the tradeoff between
determinacy and conciseness, the framework allows controlling the level of
granularity by adopting different fragments of view definitions, such as ones
highlighting whole columns, foreign keys between tables, relevant groups of
tuples, and so on. We investigate the realization of the framework in the case
of hetero-GNNs. We develop heuristic algorithms that avoid the exhaustive
search over the space of all databases. We propose techniques that are
model-agnostic, and others that are tailored to hetero-GNNs via the notion of
learnable masking. Our approach is evaluated through an extensive empirical
study on the RelBench collection, covering a variety of domains and different
record-level tasks. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed
explanations, as well as the efficiency of their generation.

### [206] [Benchmarking Energy Efficiency of Large Language Models Using vLLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08867)
*K. Pronk,Q. Zhao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了LLM效能基准测试，使用vLLM模拟真实使用场景，分析模型大小、架构和并发请求对能耗的影响，为开发者提供可持续AI系统的见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型(LLMs)的普及导致能源消耗很大，影响气候。现有的能耗评估基准不能满足真实生产环境的需求，需要更好地了解LLMs的能源效率。

Method: 使用vLLM高吞向量LLM服务后端，构建了模拟真实使用条件的效能基准测试。研究模型大小、架构和并发请求量等因素对推理能耗效率的影响。

Result: 证明了可以创建更好反映实际部署条件的能源效率基准测试，为开发者提供了有价值的见解。

Conclusion: 该基准测试能够为开发者提供更准确的能源效率信息，帮助建设更可持续的AI系统，减少LLMs对环境的负面影响。

Abstract: The prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is having an growing impact on
the climate due to the substantial energy required for their deployment and
use. To create awareness for developers who are implementing LLMs in their
products, there is a strong need to collect more information about the energy
efficiency of LLMs. While existing research has evaluated the energy efficiency
of various models, these benchmarks often fall short of representing realistic
production scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the LLM Efficiency Benchmark,
designed to simulate real-world usage conditions. Our benchmark utilizes vLLM,
a high-throughput, production-ready LLM serving backend that optimizes model
performance and efficiency. We examine how factors such as model size,
architecture, and concurrent request volume affect inference energy efficiency.
Our findings demonstrate that it is possible to create energy efficiency
benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment conditions, providing
valuable insights for developers aiming to build more sustainable AI systems.

### [207] [Probing Pre-trained Language Models on Code Changes: Insights from ReDef, a High-Confidence Just-in-Time Defect Prediction Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09192)
*Doha Nam,Taehyoun Kim,Duksan Ryu,Jongmoon Baik*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了ReDef数据集，通过回滚提交和GPT辅助筛选构建了高信度的软件缺陷预测数据集，并系统评估了预训练语言模型在代码修改理解方面的能力和局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的JIT-SDP数据集存在噪声标签和低精确度问题，需要更可靠的数据集来支持软件缺陷预测研究。

Method: 使用回滚提交标记缺陷修改，通过历史检查验证清洁修改，采用GPT辅助的多票审核流程筛选模糊实例，构建了3,164个缺陷修改和10,268个清洁修改。对三种PLM模型进行微调，测试五种编码策略，并通过反事实扰动探针模型的理解能力。

Result: diff风格编码在所有PLM上都比整体函数格式表现更好，但反事实测试显示模型性能减退很少，说明模型依赖浅层线索而非真正的语义理解。

Conclusion: 当前的预训练语言模型在代码修改理解方面存在局限性，虽然在标准测试中表现良好，但并没有真正掌握代码修改的语义。

Abstract: Just-in-Time software defect prediction (JIT-SDP) plays a critical role in
prioritizing risky code changes during code review and continuous integration.
However, existing datasets often suffer from noisy labels and low precision in
identifying bug-inducing commits. To address this, we present ReDef
(Revert-based Defect dataset), a high-confidence benchmark of function-level
modifications curated from 22 large-scale C/C++ projects. Defective cases are
anchored by revert commits, while clean cases are validated through post-hoc
history checks. Ambiguous instances are conservatively filtered out via a
GPT-assisted triage process involving multiple votes and audits. This pipeline
yields 3,164 defective and 10,268 clean modifications, offering substantially
more reliable labels than prior existing resources. Beyond dataset
construction, we provide the first systematic evaluation of how pre-trained
language models (PLMs) reason about code modifications -- specifically, which
input encodings most effectively expose change information, and whether models
genuinely capture edit semantics. We fine-tune CodeBERT, CodeT5+, and UniXcoder
under five encoding strategies, and further probe their sensitivity through
counterfactual perturbations that swap added/deleted blocks, invert diff
polarity, or inject spurious markers. Our results show that compact diff-style
encodings consistently outperform whole-function formats across all PLMs, with
statistical tests confirming large, model-independent effects. However, under
counterfactual tests, performance degrades little or not at all -- revealing
that what appears to be robustness in fact reflects reliance on superficial
cues rather than true semantic understanding. These findings indicate that,
unlike in snapshot-based tasks, current PLMs remain limited in their ability to
genuinely comprehend code modifications.

TL;DR: 提出了将大语言模型与传统软件工程方法（特别是基于场景的编程范式）相结合的方法论，以提高软件开发可靠性并减少错误


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs能显著减少开发时间并生成组织良好的代码，但经常引入严重错误并以说服性自信呈现错误代码，需要更可靠的方式将LLMs整合到软件开发周期中

Method: 结合大语言模型与基于场景的编程（SBP）范式，让开发人员注入专家知识，并检查和验证LLM输出

Result: 通过案例研究设计了Connect4游戏，创建了能够击败现有强智能体的高能力代理，并在某些情况下能够形式化验证代理的正确性

Conclusion: 该方法论有效结合了LLMs和传统软件工程技术，提高了开发过程的可靠性和验证能力，同时揭示了该方法在易用性方面的有趣见解

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are fast becoming indispensable tools for
software developers, assisting or even partnering with them in crafting complex
programs. The advantages are evident -- LLMs can significantly reduce
development time, generate well-organized and comprehensible code, and
occasionally suggest innovative ideas that developers might not conceive on
their own. However, despite their strengths, LLMs will often introduce
significant errors and present incorrect code with persuasive confidence,
potentially misleading developers into accepting flawed solutions.
  In order to bring LLMs into the software development cycle in a more reliable
manner, we propose a methodology for combining them with ``traditional''
software engineering techniques in a structured way, with the goal of
streamlining the development process, reducing errors, and enabling users to
verify crucial program properties with increased confidence. Specifically, we
focus on the Scenario-Based Programming (SBP) paradigm -- an event-driven,
scenario-based approach for software engineering -- to allow human developers
to pour their expert knowledge into the LLM, as well as to inspect and verify
its outputs.
  To evaluate our methodology, we conducted a significant case study, and used
it to design and implement the Connect4 game. By combining LLMs and SBP we were
able to create a highly-capable agent, which could defeat various strong
existing agents. Further, in some cases, we were able to formally verify the
correctness of our agent. Finally, our experience reveals interesting insights
regarding the ease-of-use of our proposed approach. The full code of our
case-study will be made publicly available with the final version of this
paper.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LoCoBench是一个专门评估长上下文LLM在复杂软件开发场景中表现的基准测试，包含8000个评估场景、10种编程语言、10K到1M token的上下文长度，涵盖8个任务类别和17个评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着支持百万token上下文窗口的语言模型出现，需要专门的基准测试来评估这些模型在理解完整代码库、跨文件推理和保持大型软件系统架构一致性方面的长上下文能力。

Method: 通过5阶段流水线系统生成多样化的高质量评估场景，涵盖10种编程语言，上下文长度从10K到1M token，包含8个任务类别，并使用包含17个指标的全面评估框架。

Result: 对最先进的长上下文模型评估显示存在显著的性能差距，表明复杂软件开发中的长上下文理解仍然是一个重要的未解决挑战。

Conclusion: LoCoBench填补了长上下文能力评估的关键空白，揭示了当前模型在复杂软件工程任务中的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要的基准工具。

Abstract: The emergence of long-context language models with context windows extending
to millions of tokens has created new opportunities for sophisticated code
understanding and software development evaluation. We propose LoCoBench, a
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate long-context LLMs in
realistic, complex software development scenarios. Unlike existing code
evaluation benchmarks that focus on single-function completion or short-context
tasks, LoCoBench addresses the critical evaluation gap for long-context
capabilities that require understanding entire codebases, reasoning across
multiple files, and maintaining architectural consistency across large-scale
software systems. Our benchmark provides 8,000 evaluation scenarios
systematically generated across 10 programming languages, with context lengths
spanning 10K to 1M tokens, a 100x variation that enables precise assessment of
long-context performance degradation in realistic software development
settings. LoCoBench introduces 8 task categories that capture essential
long-context capabilities: architectural understanding, cross-file refactoring,
multi-session development, bug investigation, feature implementation, code
comprehension, integration testing, and security analysis. Through a 5-phase
pipeline, we create diverse, high-quality scenarios that challenge LLMs to
reason about complex codebases at unprecedented scale. We introduce a
comprehensive evaluation framework with 17 metrics across 4 dimensions,
including 8 new evaluation metrics, combined in a LoCoBench Score (LCBS). Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art long-context models reveals substantial
performance gaps, demonstrating that long-context understanding in complex
software development represents a significant unsolved challenge that demands
more attention. LoCoBench is released at:

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种适配性空间时间模型(AdaST-Sleep)，用于预测睡眠评分，通过卷积神经网结合递归神经网结构和域分类器，在多种时间窗口设置下都超过基线模型，并能够准确跟踪睡眠评分水平和淌动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 睡眠预测能够让个人和医疗服务提供者预先预测并主动处理影响睡眠质量的因素，最终改善心理和身体健康。

Method: 提出适配性空间时间模型(AdaST-Sleep)，结合卷积层捐捕多种特征间的空间特征交互作用，通过递归神经网经层处理长期健康数据，并集成域分类器以实现不同主体间的泛化。

Result: 在5种输入窗口大小(3,5,7,9,11天)和5种预测窗口大小(1,3,5,7,9天)的实验中，该方法均超过四个基线模型，在7天输入窗口和1天预测窗口下获得最低RMSE(0.282)，并在多天预测中仍保持强劲性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为使用商业可穿戴设备的稀疏数据和域适配技术进行个性化睡眠预测提供了稳健而适配性强的解决方案。

Abstract: A sleep forecast allows individuals and healthcare providers to anticipate
and proactively address factors influencing restful rest, ultimately improving
mental and physical well-being. This work presents an adaptive spatial and
temporal model (AdaST-Sleep) for predicting sleep scores. Our proposed model
combines convolutional layers to capture spatial feature interactions between
multiple features and recurrent neural network layers to handle longer-term
temporal health-related data. A domain classifier is further integrated to
generalize across different subjects. We conducted several experiments using
five input window sizes (3, 5, 7, 9, 11 days) and five predicting window sizes
(1, 3, 5, 7, 9 days). Our approach consistently outperformed four baseline
models, achieving its lowest RMSE (0.282) with a seven-day input window and a
one-day predicting window. Moreover, the method maintained strong performance
even when forecasting multiple days into the future, demonstrating its
versatility for real-world applications. Visual comparisons reveal that the
model accurately tracks both the overall sleep score level and daily
fluctuations. These findings prove that the proposed framework provides a
robust and adaptable solution for personalized sleep forecasting using sparse
data from commercial wearable devices and domain adaptation techniques.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: SNUPHY-M模型通过自监督学习同时分析ECG、PPG和ABP三种生理信号，在血流动力学监测任务中显著优于有监督和其他自监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床需要综合分析多种生理信号来监测血流动力学，但现有研究多集中于单一信号分析，缺乏适用于真实临床场景的复杂信号分析方法。

Method: 基于自监督学习的掩码表示学习方法，通过恢复三种被掩码的生理信号（ECG、PPG、ABP）来提取反映心动周期电学、压力和流体特性的生理特征。

Result: 在低血压、每搏输出量、收缩压、舒张压和年龄预测等临床下游任务中，SNUPHY-M显著优于有监督或自监督模型，特别是在使用无创信号的预测任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: SNUPHY-M是首个将多模态自监督学习应用于ECG、PPG和ABP信号心血管分析的模型，有效支持临床决策和精确诊断，为无创血流动力学早期诊断和管理做出重要贡献。

Abstract: In clinical settings, monitoring hemodynamics is crucial for managing patient
prognosis, necessitating the integrated analysis of multiple physiological
signals. While recent research has analyzed single signals such as
electrocardiography (ECG) or photoplethysmography (PPG), there has yet to be a
proposal for an approach that encompasses the complex signal analysis required
in actual clinical scenarios. In this study, we introduce the SNUPHY-M (Seoul
National University hospital PHYsiological signal Masked representation
learning) model extracts physiological features reflecting the electrical,
pressure, and fluid characteristics of the cardiac cycle in the process of
restoring three masked physiological signals based on self-supervised learning
(SSL): ECG, PPG, and arterial blood pressure (ABP) signals. By employing
multiple physical characteristics, the model can extract more enriched features
only using non-invasive signals. We evaluated the model's performance in
clinical downstream tasks such as hypotension, stroke volume, systolic blood
pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and age prediction. Our results showed that
the SNUPHY-M significantly outperformed supervised or SSL models, especially in
prediction tasks using non-invasive signals. To the best of our knowledge,
SNUPHY-M is the first model to apply multi-modal SSL to cardiovascular analysis
involving ECG, PPG, and ABP signals. This approach effectively supports
clinical decision-making and enables precise diagnostics, contributing
significantly to the early diagnosis and management of hemodynamics without
invasiveness.

Motivation: AI技术虽取得重大突破，但如何负责任地使用AI来改善全球人类状况，特别是在教育领域的公平应用，是当前面临的重要挑战。

Method: 提供技术问题入门指南，包括确保公平包容性、处理幻觉输出、资源高效使用等，并通过开发沉浸式结构化"智能教科书"来展示这些考虑因素。

Abstract: Powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools that have emerged in recent years
-- including large language models, automated coding assistants, and advanced
image and speech generation technologies -- are the result of monumental human
achievements. These breakthroughs reflect mastery across multiple technical
disciplines and the resolution of significant technological challenges.
However, some of the most profound challenges may still lie ahead. These
challenges are not purely technical but pertain to the fair and responsible use
of AI in ways that genuinely improve the global human condition. This article
explores one promising application aligned with that vision: the use of AI
tools to facilitate and enhance education, with a specific focus on signal
processing (SP). It presents two interrelated perspectives: identifying and
addressing technical limitations, and applying AI tools in practice to improve
educational experiences. Primers are provided on several core technical issues
that arise when using AI in educational settings, including how to ensure
fairness and inclusivity, handle hallucinated outputs, and achieve efficient
use of resources. These and other considerations -- such as transparency,
explainability, and trustworthiness -- are illustrated through the development
of an immersive, structured, and reliable "smart textbook." The article serves
as a resource for researchers and educators seeking to advance AI's role in

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本研究通过在不同分辨率下应用神经网络并找到最佳平衡点，显著降低了锥束CT散射校正的深度学习模型计算量和内存需求，实现了78倍FLOPs减少和16倍推理速度提升，同时保持可比性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 锥束CT扫描中的散射伪影严重降低图像质量，虽然深度学习方法在散射估计方面表现出潜力，但由于网络内存占用大，在移动CBCT系统或边缘设备上的部署仍然受限。

Method: 首先在六个分辨率下检查CBCT散射信号的下采样-上采样重建误差，比较四种插值方法；然后在五个图像分辨率上训练最新的SOTA方法，评估FLOPs、推理时间和GPU内存需求的减少。

Result: 减少输入尺寸和网络参数实现了78倍的FLOPs减少，MAPE从4.42%降至3.85%，MSE从2.01×10⁻²降至1.34×10⁻²，推理时间和GPU内存使用分别减少16倍和12倍。在水模和Sedentex CT模体的真实CBCT扫描上验证了方法的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了降采样在基于深度学习的散射估计中被低估的作用，方法实现的FLOPs和GPU内存需求大幅减少使得在资源受限环境（如移动CBCT和边缘设备）中进行散射校正成为可能。

Abstract: Purpose: Scatter artifacts drastically degrade the image quality of cone-beam
computed tomography (CBCT) scans. Although deep learning-based methods show
promise in estimating scatter from CBCT measurements, their deployment in
mobile CBCT systems or edge devices is still limited due to the large memory
footprint of the networks. This study addresses the issue by applying networks
at varying resolutions and suggesting an optimal one, based on speed and
accuracy.
  Methods: First, the reconstruction error in down-up sampling of CBCT scatter
signal was examined at six resolutions by comparing four interpolation methods.
Next, a recent state-of-the-art method was trained across five image
resolutions and evaluated for the reductions in floating-point operations
(FLOPs), inference times, and GPU memory requirements.
  Results: Reducing the input size and network parameters achieved a 78-fold
reduction in FLOPs compared to the baseline method, while maintaining comarable
performance in terms of mean-absolute-percentage-error (MAPE) and
mean-square-error (MSE). Specifically, the MAPE decreased to 3.85% compared to
4.42%, and the MSE decreased to 1.34 \times 10^{-2} compared to 2.01 \times
10^{-2}. Inference time and GPU memory usage were reduced by factors of 16 and
12, respectively. Further experiments comparing scatter-corrected
reconstructions on a large, simulated dataset and real CBCT scans from water
and Sedentex CT phantoms clearly demonstrated the robustness of our method.
  Conclusion: This study highlights the underappreciated role of downsampling
in deep learning-based scatter estimation. The substantial reduction in FLOPs
and GPU memory requirements achieved by our method enables scatter correction
in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile CBCT and edge devices.

Method: 基于市场机制的任务分配方法，设计分布式协调算法，特别考虑了非对称障碍物的处理。

Result: 在仿真和真实NAO机器人实验中验证，在有限通信环境下任务重叠减少52%。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效处理通信受限、部分可观测环境中的动态非对称障碍物问题，显著提升多智能体协调效率。

Abstract: Coordinating a fully distributed multi-agent system (MAS) can be challenging
when the communication channel has very limited capabilities in terms of
sending rate and packet payload. When the MAS has to deal with active obstacles
in a highly partially observable environment, the communication channel
acquires considerable relevance. In this paper, we present an approach to deal
with task assignments in extremely active scenarios, where tasks need to be
frequently reallocated among the agents participating in the coordination
process. Inspired by market-based task assignments, we introduce a novel
distributed coordination method to orchestrate autonomous agents' actions
efficiently in low communication scenarios. In particular, our algorithm takes
into account asymmetric obstacles. While in the real world, the majority of
obstacles are asymmetric, they are usually treated as symmetric ones, thus
limiting the applicability of existing methods. To summarize, the presented
architecture is designed to tackle scenarios where the obstacles are active and
asymmetric, the communication channel is poor and the environment is partially
observable. Our approach has been validated in simulation and in the real
world, using a team of NAO robots during official RoboCup competitions.
Experimental results show a notable reduction in task overlaps in limited
communication settings, with a decrease of 52% in the most frequent reallocated
task.

TL;DR: OmniEVA是一个多模态大语言模型，通过任务自适应的3D接地机制和具身感知推理框架，解决了现有具身智能系统中的几何适应性差距和具身约束差距问题，在多种下游场景中表现出强大的规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于MLLM的具身系统存在两个关键限制：几何适应性差距（2D输入或硬编码3D几何注入导致空间信息不足或泛化受限）和具身约束差距（忽略真实机器人的物理约束，导致理论上有效但实际不可行的任务计划）。

Method: 提出了两个关键创新：(1)任务自适应的3D接地机制，通过门控路由器根据上下文需求进行显式选择性3D融合调节；(2)具身感知推理框架，将任务目标和具身约束共同纳入推理循环，生成既目标导向又可执行的规划决策。

Result: 大量实验结果表明，OmniEVA不仅实现了最先进的通用具身推理性能，还在广泛的下游场景中表现出强大能力。在包括原始任务和复合任务的一系列具身基准测试中确认了其鲁棒且多功能的规划能力。

Conclusion: OmniEVA通过创新的3D接地和具身感知推理方法，有效解决了当前MLLM-based具身系统的关键限制，为具身智能提供了更强大和实用的规划解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new
opportunities for embodied intelligence, enabling multimodal understanding,
reasoning, and interaction, as well as continuous spatial decision-making.
Nevertheless, current MLLM-based embodied systems face two critical
limitations. First, Geometric Adaptability Gap: models trained solely on 2D
inputs or with hard-coded 3D geometry injection suffer from either insufficient
spatial information or restricted 2D generalization, leading to poor
adaptability across tasks with diverse spatial demands. Second, Embodiment
Constraint Gap: prior work often neglects the physical constraints and
capacities of real robots, resulting in task plans that are theoretically valid
but practically infeasible.To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEVA -- an
embodied versatile planner that enables advanced embodied reasoning and task
planning through two pivotal innovations: (1) a Task-Adaptive 3D Grounding
mechanism, which introduces a gated router to perform explicit selective
regulation of 3D fusion based on contextual requirements, enabling
context-aware 3D grounding for diverse embodied tasks. (2) an Embodiment-Aware
Reasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment
constraints into the reasoning loop, resulting in planning decisions that are
both goal-directed and executable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that OmniEVA not only achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning
performance, but also exhibits a strong ability across a wide range of
downstream scenarios. Evaluations of a suite of proposed embodied benchmarks,
including both primitive and composite tasks, confirm its robust and versatile
planning capabilities. Project page: https://omnieva.github.io

TL;DR: KoopMotion是一种基于流场的运动规划方法，使用Koopman算子理论来学习期望轨迹的动态系统表示，确保机器人从任意初始状态收敛到参考轨迹的终点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Koopman算子理论在动态系统建模中表现出色，但它本身不能保证收敛到期望轨迹或指定目标，而这是从演示学习(LfD)中的关键要求。

Method: 将运动流场表示为动态系统，用Koopman算子参数化来模仿期望轨迹，利用学习到的流场的发散特性获得平滑的运动场，使机器人能够收敛到参考轨迹并跟踪至终点。

Result: 在LASA手写数据集和3D机械臂末端轨迹数据集上展示了有效性，包括频谱分析。在物理机器人上的实验验证了在非静态流体环境中的性能。方法具有高度样本效率，仅需3%的LASA数据即可生成密集运动规划。

Conclusion: KoopMotion在空间和时间动态建模效能指标上显著优于基线方法，为从演示学习的运动规划提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel flow field-based motion planning method that
drives a robot from any initial state to a desired reference trajectory such
that it converges to the trajectory's end point. Despite demonstrated efficacy
in using Koopman operator theory for modeling dynamical systems, Koopman does
not inherently enforce convergence to desired trajectories nor to specified
goals -- a requirement when learning from demonstrations (LfD). We present
KoopMotion which represents motion flow fields as dynamical systems,
parameterized by Koopman Operators to mimic desired trajectories, and leverages
the divergence properties of the learnt flow fields to obtain smooth motion
fields that converge to a desired reference trajectory when a robot is placed
away from the desired trajectory, and tracks the trajectory until the end
point. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show evaluations of
KoopMotion on the LASA human handwriting dataset and a 3D manipulator
end-effector trajectory dataset, including spectral analysis. We also perform
experiments on a physical robot, verifying KoopMotion on a miniature autonomous
surface vehicle operating in a non-static fluid flow environment. Our approach
is highly sample efficient in both space and time, requiring only 3\% of the
LASA dataset to generate dense motion plans. Additionally, KoopMotion provides
a significant improvement over baselines when comparing metrics that measure
spatial and temporal dynamics modeling efficacy.

fundamental challenges: (i) the scarcity and high cost of large-scale
human-operated robotic trajectories required for SFT scaling, and (ii) limited
generalization to tasks involving distribution shift. Recent breakthroughs in
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can
dramatically enhance step-by-step reasoning capabilities, raising a natural
question: Can RL similarly improve the long-horizon step-by-step action
planning of VLA? In this work, we introduce SimpleVLA-RL, an efficient RL
framework tailored for VLA models. Building upon veRL, we introduce
VLA-specific trajectory sampling, scalable parallelization, multi-environment
rendering, and optimized loss computation. When applied to OpenVLA-OFT,
SimpleVLA-RL achieves SoTA performance on LIBERO and even outperforms $\pi_0$
on RoboTwin 1.0\&2.0 with the exploration-enhancing strategies we introduce.
SimpleVLA-RL not only reduces dependence on large-scale data and enables robust
generalization, but also remarkably surpasses SFT in real-world tasks.
Moreover, we identify a novel phenomenon ``pushcut'' during RL training,
wherein the policy discovers previously unseen patterns beyond those seen in
the previous training process. Github: https://github.com/PRIME-RL/SimpleVLA-RL

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于对象相对控制的新视觉导航方法ObjectReact，通过使用相对3D场景图和对象级表征来充分利用对象的体验不变性，实现了更好的跨体验部署能力和反向导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像级表征存在限制，因为图像与代理的位姿和体验绑定，而对象作为地图属性提供了体验和轨迹不变的世界表征。需要充分利用对象的优势来克服图像相对控制方法的局限性。

Method: 提出了一种基于"相对3D场景图"的顶层地图表征，用于获取更信息丰富的对象级全局路径规划成本。训练了一个直接条件在高级"WayObject Costmap"表征上的本地控制器ObjectReact，消除了显式RGB输入的需求。

Result: 在传感器高度变化和多种导航任务中，对象相对控制方法在空间理解能力方面显示出明显优势，包括可以反向导航地图轨迹。仅使用模拟器训练的策略能够良好地沿用到真实室内环境。

Conclusion: 对象相对控制方法为视觉导航提供了一种更优雅的解决方案，具有更高的伸缩性和跨体验部署能力，能够充分利用对象表征的体验不变性优势。

Abstract: Visual navigation using only a single camera and a topological map has
recently become an appealing alternative to methods that require additional
sensors and 3D maps. This is typically achieved through an "image-relative"
approach to estimating control from a given pair of current observation and
subgoal image. However, image-level representations of the world have
limitations because images are strictly tied to the agent's pose and
embodiment. In contrast, objects, being a property of the map, offer an
embodiment- and trajectory-invariant world representation. In this work, we
present a new paradigm of learning "object-relative" control that exhibits
several desirable characteristics: a) new routes can be traversed without
strictly requiring to imitate prior experience, b) the control prediction
problem can be decoupled from solving the image matching problem, and c) high
invariance can be achieved in cross-embodiment deployment for variations across
both training-testing and mapping-execution settings. We propose a topometric
map representation in the form of a "relative" 3D scene graph, which is used to
obtain more informative object-level global path planning costs. We train a
local controller, dubbed "ObjectReact", conditioned directly on a high-level
"WayObject Costmap" representation that eliminates the need for an explicit RGB
input. We demonstrate the advantages of learning object-relative control over
its image-relative counterpart across sensor height variations and multiple
navigation tasks that challenge the underlying spatial understanding
capability, e.g., navigating a map trajectory in the reverse direction. We
further show that our sim-only policy is able to generalize well to real-world
indoor environments. Code and supplementary material are accessible via project

TL;DR: Dexplore是一个统一单循环优化框架，直接从大规模手-物体运动捕捉数据学习机器人控制策略，避免了传统三阶段流程的误差累积问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用重定向、跟踪和残差校正的三阶段流程，导致演示数据利用不足和误差累积，且人类演示的不准确性和人-机器人手之间的本体差距限制了数据的直接使用

Method: 联合执行重定向和跟踪的统一优化，将演示作为软指导而非绝对真值，从原始轨迹推导自适应空间范围，使用强化学习训练策略在范围内保持的同时最小化控制努力并完成任务

Result: 统一框架保留了演示意图，使机器人特定策略得以涌现，提高了对噪声的鲁棒性，并能扩展到大规模演示语料库

Conclusion: Dexplore提供了一个原则性的桥梁，将不完美的演示转化为灵巧操作的有效训练信号，并通过蒸馏得到支持跨对象泛化和真实世界部署的视觉基础生成控制器

Abstract: Hand-object motion-capture (MoCap) repositories offer large-scale,
contact-rich demonstrations and hold promise for scaling dexterous robotic
manipulation. Yet demonstration inaccuracies and embodiment gaps between human
and robot hands limit the straightforward use of these data. Existing methods
adopt a three-stage workflow, including retargeting, tracking, and residual
correction, which often leaves demonstrations underused and compound errors
across stages. We introduce Dexplore, a unified single-loop optimization that
jointly performs retargeting and tracking to learn robot control policies
directly from MoCap at scale. Rather than treating demonstrations as ground
truth, we use them as soft guidance. From raw trajectories, we derive adaptive
spatial scopes, and train with reinforcement learning to keep the policy
in-scope while minimizing control effort and accomplishing the task. This
unified formulation preserves demonstration intent, enables robot-specific
strategies to emerge, improves robustness to noise, and scales to large
demonstration corpora. We distill the scaled tracking policy into a
vision-based, skill-conditioned generative controller that encodes diverse
manipulation skills in a rich latent representation, supporting generalization
across objects and real-world deployment. Taken together, these contributions
position Dexplore as a principled bridge that transforms imperfect
demonstrations into effective training signals for dexterous manipulation.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: WarpPINN-fibers是一个基于物理信息神经网络的框架，通过整合纤维信息来准确获取心脏运动和应变，改进了传统方法在纤维力学建模方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏收缩运动受纤维分布影响显著，传统应变分析方法缺乏纤维力学建模，限制了准确解释心脏功能的能力。

Method: 构建包含三个损失项的神经网络：数据相似性损失、近不可压缩性正则化和纤维拉伸惩罚项，通过超弹性模型和纤维收缩促进来预测心脏变形场。

Result: 在合成实验中改进了原有模型并有效控制纤维拉伸，在15名健康志愿者的cine-MRI基准测试中，在标志点跟踪和应变曲线预测方面优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够通过准确的变形场实现更精确的心脏应变量化，且只需要MRI成像技术，无需更复杂的成像方法。

Abstract: The contractile motion of the heart is strongly determined by the
distribution of the fibers that constitute cardiac tissue. Strain analysis
informed with the orientation of fibers allows to describe several pathologies
that are typically associated with impaired mechanics of the myocardium, such
as cardiovascular disease. Several methods have been developed to estimate
strain-derived metrics from traditional imaging techniques. However, the
physical models underlying these methods do not include fiber mechanics,
restricting their capacity to accurately explain cardiac function. In this
work, we introduce WarpPINN-fibers, a physics-informed neural network framework
to accurately obtain cardiac motion and strains enhanced by fiber information.
We train our neural network to satisfy a hyper-elastic model and promote fiber
contraction with the goal to predict the deformation field of the heart from
cine magnetic resonance images. For this purpose, we build a loss function
composed of three terms: a data-similarity loss between the reference and the
warped template images, a regularizer enforcing near-incompressibility of
cardiac tissue and a fiber-stretch penalization that controls strain in the
direction of synthetically produced fibers. We show that our neural network
improves the former WarpPINN model and effectively controls fiber stretch in a
synthetic phantom experiment. Then, we demonstrate that WarpPINN-fibers
outperforms alternative methodologies in landmark-tracking and strain curve
prediction for a cine-MRI benchmark with a cohort of 15 healthy volunteers. We
expect that our method will enable a more precise quantification of cardiac
strains through accurate deformation fields that are consistent with fiber
physiology, without requiring imaging techniques more sophisticated than MRI.

Motivation: 传统2D组织学需要牧理切片和化学染色，而3D X光组织学技术虽然无侵入但灰度图像对比度有限，化学特异性不如传统染色技术

Method: 使用过50个对齐的微CT和塑腊蓝染色组织学图像对，训练了一个修改版CycleGAN网络，包含像素监督和灰度一致性条款，进行片段基础训练并使用随机数据增强

Result: 在SSIM、PSNR和LPIPS指标上超过了Pix2Pix和标准CycleGAN基线模型，能够生成组织学真实的色彩输出保持高分辨率结构细节，新骨组织形成等特征能够复现

Conclusion: 这项工作将虚拟染色技术扩展到3D X光成像领域，为生物医学研究提供了一种可扩展的化学信息丰富的无标记组织定性方法，虽然在描述移植物降解层时存在一些变异性

Abstract: Three-dimensional X-ray histology techniques offer a non-invasive alternative
to conventional 2D histology, enabling volumetric imaging of biological tissues
without the need for physical sectioning or chemical staining. However, the
inherent greyscale image contrast of X-ray tomography limits its biochemical
specificity compared to traditional histological stains. Within digital
pathology, deep learning-based virtual staining has demonstrated utility in
simulating stained appearances from label-free optical images. In this study,
we extend virtual staining to the X-ray domain by applying cross-modality image
translation to generate artificially stained slices from
synchrotron-radiation-based micro-CT scans. Using over 50 co-registered image
pairs of micro-CT and toluidine blue-stained histology from bone-implant
samples, we trained a modified CycleGAN network tailored for limited paired
data. Whole slide histology images were downsampled to match the voxel size of
the CT data, with on-the-fly data augmentation for patch-based training. The
model incorporates pixelwise supervision and greyscale consistency terms,
producing histologically realistic colour outputs while preserving
high-resolution structural detail. Our method outperformed Pix2Pix and standard
CycleGAN baselines across SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS metrics. Once trained, the
model can be applied to full CT volumes to generate virtually stained 3D
datasets, enhancing interpretability without additional sample preparation.
While features such as new bone formation were able to be reproduced, some
variability in the depiction of implant degradation layers highlights the need
for further training data and refinement. This work introduces virtual staining
to 3D X-ray imaging and offers a scalable route for chemically informative,
label-free tissue characterisation in biomedical research.

TL;DR: 提出新颖的动态结构参数，并将其整合到多模态深度学习框架中，用于预测特发性全层黄斑裂孔患者术后视力恢复情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种能够准确预测黄斑裂孔手术后视力恢复的自动化临床决策支持工具，通过整合动态参数和多模态数据来提高预测精度。

Method: 使用公开的纵向OCT数据集，构建阶段特异性分割模型提取定量、复合、定性和动态特征。开发包含临床变量、OCT特征和原始OCT图像的多模态深度学习模型，并与逻辑回归模型进行对比。

Result: 分割模型在所有时间点均达到高精度（平均Dice > 0.89）。动态恢复率的加入显著改善了逻辑回归模型的AUC，特别是在3个月随访时。多模态DL模型在所有阶段均优于逻辑回归，AUC差异高达0.12。

Conclusion: 将动态参数整合到多模态深度学习模型中显著提高了预测准确性，这一全自动化流程有望成为黄斑裂孔手术个性化术后管理的有前景的临床决策支持工具。

Abstract: Purpose: To introduce novel dynamic structural parameters and evaluate their
integration within a multimodal deep learning (DL) framework for predicting
postoperative visual recovery in idiopathic full-thickness macular hole (iFTMH)
patients. Methods: We utilized a publicly available longitudinal OCT dataset at
five stages (preoperative, 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months). A stage
specific segmentation model delineated related structures, and an automated
pipeline extracted quantitative, composite, qualitative, and dynamic features.
Binary logistic regression models, constructed with and without dynamic
parameters, assessed their incremental predictive value for best-corrected
visual acuity (BCVA). A multimodal DL model combining clinical variables,
OCT-derived features, and raw OCT images was developed and benchmarked against
regression models. Results: The segmentation model achieved high accuracy
across all timepoints (mean Dice > 0.89). Univariate and multivariate analyses
identified base diameter, ellipsoid zone integrity, and macular hole area as
significant BCVA predictors (P < 0.05). Incorporating dynamic recovery rates
consistently improved logistic regression AUC, especially at the 3-month
follow-up. The multimodal DL model outperformed logistic regression, yielding
higher AUCs and overall accuracy at each stage. The difference is as high as
0.12, demonstrating the complementary value of raw image volume and dynamic
parameters. Conclusions: Integrating dynamic parameters into the multimodal DL
model significantly enhances the accuracy of predictions. This fully automated
process therefore represents a promising clinical decision support tool for
personalized postoperative management in macular hole surgery.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于查找表(LUT)的实用循环筛波解决方案LUT-ILF++，通过将深度神经网络输出缓存到LUT中，替代重载的推理计算，在保持编码效果的同时大大降低了时间复杂度和存储成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络基于循环筛波方案虽然能够获得显著的编码收益，但带来了较高的计算和时间复杂度，或者需要专用硬件支持，限制了其普遍应用。

Method: 训练一个参考范围受限的DNN网络，然后遍历所有可能输入并将输出缓存到LUT中。编码过程中通过查找表和插值来进行筛波，避免重载的推理计算。还提出了多种筛波LUT协作机制、跨分量索引机制以及LUT压缩方案来降低存储成本。

Result: 在VVC参考软件中实现，实验结果显示：在AI和RA配置下，对于常见测试序列，该框架分别实现了平均0.82%/2.97%/1.63%和0.85%/4.11%/2.06%的比特率减少。与DNN基于方案相比，时间复杂度和存储成本大大降低。

Conclusion: LUT-ILF++框架提供了一种高效实用的循环筛波解决方案，通过LUT技术在保持编码性能的同时有效降低了计算复杂度，为下一代视频编码标准提供了实用的ILF方案。

Abstract: In-loop filtering (ILF) is a key technology in video coding standards to
reduce artifacts and enhance visual quality. Recently, neural network-based ILF
schemes have achieved remarkable coding gains, emerging as a powerful candidate
for next-generation video coding standards. However, the use of deep neural
networks (DNN) brings significant computational and time complexity or high
demands for dedicated hardware, making it challenging for general use. To
address this limitation, we study a practical ILF solution by adopting look-up
tables (LUTs). After training a DNN with a restricted reference range for ILF,
all possible inputs are traversed, and the output values of the DNN are cached
into LUTs. During the coding process, the filtering process is performed by
simply retrieving the filtered pixel through locating the input pixels and
interpolating between the cached values, instead of relying on heavy inference
computations. In this paper, we propose a universal LUT-based ILF framework,
termed LUT-ILF++. First, we introduce the cooperation of multiple kinds of
filtering LUTs and propose a series of customized indexing mechanisms to enable
better filtering reference perception with limited storage consumption. Second,
we propose the cross-component indexing mechanism to enable the filtering of
different color components jointly. Third, in order to make our solution
practical for coding uses, we propose the LUT compaction scheme to enable the
LUT pruning, achieving a lower storage cost of the entire solution. The
proposed framework is implemented in the VVC reference software. Experimental
results show that the proposed framework achieves on average 0.82%/2.97%/1.63%
and 0.85%/4.11%/2.06% bitrate reduction for common test sequences, under the AI
and RA configurations, respectively. Compared to DNN-based solutions, our
proposed solution has much lower time complexity and storage cost.

Motivation: 探索一阶优化方法中优化曲线的凸性特性，建立离散迭代与连续时间动态之间的联系，完善凸优化理论工具箱。

Method: 通过理论分析梯度下降法在凸L-平滑函数上的行为，研究优化曲线f(x_n)的凸性条件，即前向差分f(x_n)-f(x_{n+1})的非递增性。

Result: 确定了梯度下降的凸性阈值η≤1.75/L，发现梯度范数在η≤2/L时非递增，连续时间梯度流总是产生凸优化曲线。

Conclusion: 研究结果连接了离散和连续优化动态，为凸优化理论提供了新的洞察和精确的步长界限，补充了经典的最坏情况分析框架。

Abstract: We study when the \emph{optimization curve} of first-order methods -- the
sequence \${f(x\_n)}*{n\ge0}\$ produced by constant-stepsize iterations -- is
convex, equivalently when the forward differences \$f(x\_n)-f(x*{n+1})\$ are
nonincreasing. For gradient descent (GD) on convex \$L\$-smooth functions, the
curve is convex for all stepsizes \$\eta \le 1.75/L\$, and this threshold is
tight. Moreover, gradient norms are nonincreasing for all \$\eta \le 2/L\$, and
in continuous time (gradient flow) the curve is always convex. These results
complement and refine the classical smooth convex optimization toolbox,
connecting discrete and continuous dynamics as well as worst-case analyses.

Motivation: 生成式AI搜索引擎的兴起正在重塑信息检索方式，从传统的排名列表转向合成式、带引用的答案，这挑战了现有的SEO实践，需要新的优化范式。

Method: 通过跨多个垂直领域、语言和查询改写的大规模受控实验，对AI搜索和传统网络搜索(Google)进行系统性比较分析。

Result: AI搜索系统性地偏向第三方权威内容(Earned media)，与Google更平衡的内容来源形成鲜明对比；不同AI搜索服务在域名多样性、新鲜度、跨语言稳定性和措辞敏感性方面存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 提出了生成引擎优化(GEO)战略议程，为从业者提供可操作指导，包括优化机器可扫描性、主导权威媒体内容、采用引擎特定策略等，为在新一代生成式搜索环境中获得可见性提供基础框架。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative AI-powered search engines like ChatGPT,
Perplexity, and Gemini is fundamentally reshaping information retrieval, moving
from traditional ranked lists to synthesized, citation-backed answers. This
shift challenges established Search Engine Optimization (SEO) practices and
necessitates a new paradigm, which we term Generative Engine Optimization
(GEO).
  This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of AI Search and
traditional web search (Google). Through a series of large-scale, controlled
experiments across multiple verticals, languages, and query paraphrases, we
quantify critical differences in how these systems source information. Our key
findings reveal that AI Search exhibit a systematic and overwhelming bias
towards Earned media (third-party, authoritative sources) over Brand-owned and
Social content, a stark contrast to Google's more balanced mix. We further
demonstrate that AI Search services differ significantly from each other in
their domain diversity, freshness, cross-language stability, and sensitivity to
phrasing.
  Based on these empirical results, we formulate a strategic GEO agenda. We
provide actionable guidance for practitioners, emphasizing the critical need
to: (1) engineer content for machine scannability and justification, (2)
dominate earned media to build AI-perceived authority, (3) adopt
engine-specific and language-aware strategies, and (4) overcome the inherent
"big brand bias" for niche players. Our work provides the foundational
empirical analysis and a strategic framework for achieving visibility in the
new generative search landscape.

Motivation: 研究无线电法规这一法律敏感和高风险领域的问答问题，需要可靠的领域特定解决方案来确保回答的准确性和权威性。

Method: 提出电信特定的RAG管道，从权威来源构建选择题评估集（通过自动过滤和人工验证），定义领域特定的检索指标来评估检索质量。

Result: 检索器在领域特定指标下达到约97%的准确率；RAG管道显著提升所有测试模型的生成准确率，特别是GPT-4o从不足1%的边际增益提升到近12%的相对改进。

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline and introduce, to our knowledge,
the first multiple-choice evaluation set for this domain, constructed from
authoritative sources using automated filtering and human validation. To assess
retrieval quality, we define a domain-specific retrieval metric, under which
our retriever achieves approximately 97% accuracy. Beyond retrieval, our
approach consistently improves generation accuracy across all tested models. In
particular, while naively inserting documents without structured retrieval
yields only marginal gains for GPT-4o (less than 1%), applying our pipeline
results in nearly a 12% relative improvement. These findings demonstrate that
carefully targeted grounding provides a simple yet strong baseline and an
effective domain-specific solution for regulatory question answering. All code

TL;DR: 这篇论文批判推荐系统研究领域长期存在的方法论问题，认为虽然2011年Amatriain就指出了统计误读和方法论捷径等问题，但该领域仍在错误基础上增加复杂度而非纠正方向。作者呼吁需要根本性的范式转变。

Motivation: 重新审视Amatriain 2011年对推荐系统研究的批评，指出该领域的概念、认识论和基础设施问题仍然存在且更加系统化，需要根本性的改革。

Method: 基于可重复性研究、评估方法学、环境影响和参与式设计等近期工作，分析领域复杂性超越自省速度的问题，并展示社区主导的范式转变尝试。

Result: 发现推荐系统研究加速的复杂性已经超过了其自省能力，许多根本问题以更微妙或系统化的形式持续存在。

Conclusion: 有意义的变革不仅需要新指标或更好工具，更需要根本性重新定义推荐系统研究的目的、服务对象以及知识生产和验证方式，呼吁建立基于认识论谦逊、人类影响和可持续实践的研究议程。

Abstract: In 2011, Xavier Amatriain sounded the alarm: recommender systems research was
"doing it all wrong" [1]. His critique, rooted in statistical misinterpretation
and methodological shortcuts, remains as relevant today as it was then. But
rather than correcting course, we added new layers of sophistication on top of
the same broken foundations. This paper revisits Amatriain's diagnosis and
argues that many of the conceptual, epistemological, and infrastructural
failures he identified still persist, in more subtle or systemic forms. Drawing
on recent work in reproducibility, evaluation methodology, environmental
impact, and participatory design, we showcase how the field's accelerating
complexity has outpaced its introspection. We highlight ongoing community-led
initiatives that attempt to shift the paradigm, including workshops, evaluation
frameworks, and calls for value-sensitive and participatory research. At the
same time, we contend that meaningful change will require not only new metrics
or better tooling, but a fundamental reframing of what recommender systems
research is for, who it serves, and how knowledge is produced and validated.
Our call is not just for technical reform, but for a recommender systems
research agenda grounded in epistemic humility, human impact, and sustainable
practice.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一种支持大规模型的给定数据Sobol' 指数计算方法，包括流式算法和绝对分区定义，解决了现有方法在内存需求和偏差问题上的限制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的给定数据方法无法处理输入参数过多（>10^4）的大型模型，如神经网络，因为需要将所有输入-输出数据同时存储在内存中，这对大规模型来说实际上不可行

Method: 提出了三个扩展：1）支持任意分区的统一Sobol'指数估计器定义；2）批量处理样本的流式算法；3）过滤统计噪声中不可区分小指数的惯例算法

Result: 数值分析显示，现有方法使用等概率分区会在大样本量下也产生显著偏差，而新方法的流式算法能够在更低内存需求下达到相似的准确性和运行时间

Conclusion: 这些扩展使得基于方差的敏感性分析能够高效地应用于包含极多输入参数的大型模型，并且在神经网络建模中展示了其实际应用价值

Abstract: Given-data methods for variance-based sensitivity analysis have significantly
advanced the feasibility of Sobol' index computation for computationally
expensive models and models with many inputs. However, the limitations of
existing methods still preclude their application to models with an extremely
large number of inputs. In this work, we present practical extensions to the
existing given-data Sobol' index method, which allow variance-based sensitivity
analysis to be efficiently performed on large models such as neural networks,
which have $>10^4$ parameterizable inputs. For models of this size, holding all
input-output evaluations simultaneously in memory -- as required by existing
methods -- can quickly become impractical. These extensions also support
nonstandard input distributions with many repeated values, which are not
amenable to equiprobable partitions employed by existing given-data methods.
  Our extensions include a general definition of the given-data Sobol' index
estimator with arbitrary partition, a streaming algorithm to process
input-output samples in batches, and a heuristic to filter out small indices
that are indistinguishable from zero indices due to statistical noise. We show
that the equiprobable partition employed in existing given-data methods can
introduce significant bias into Sobol' index estimates even at large sample
sizes and provide numerical analyses that demonstrate why this can occur. We
also show that our streaming algorithm can achieve comparable accuracy and
runtimes with lower memory requirements, relative to current methods which
process all samples at once. We demonstrate our novel developments on two
application problems in neural network modeling.

Abstract: Many optimization problems in robotics involve the optimization of
time-expensive black-box functions, such as those involving complex simulations
or evaluation of real-world experiments. Furthermore, these functions are often
stochastic as repeated experiments are subject to unmeasurable disturbances.
Bayesian optimization can be used to optimize such methods in an efficient
manner by deploying a probabilistic function estimator to estimate with a given
confidence so that regions of the search space can be pruned away.
Consequently, the success of the Bayesian optimization depends on the function
estimator's ability to provide informative confidence bounds. Existing function
estimators require many function evaluations to infer the underlying confidence
or depend on modeling of the disturbances. In this paper, it is shown that the
confidence bounds provided by the Wilson Score Kernel Density Estimator
(WS-KDE) are applicable as excellent bounds to any stochastic function with an
output confined to the closed interval [0;1] regardless of the distribution of
the output. This finding opens up the use of WS-KDE for stable global
optimization on a wider range of cost functions. The properties of WS-KDE in
the context of Bayesian optimization are demonstrated in simulation and applied
to the problem of automated trap design for vibrational part feeders.

Conclusion: 该方法为设置低次多项式下界提供了更直接的证明策略，同时为设计优化的多项式时间算法提供了见解。

Abstract: Low-degree polynomials have emerged as a powerful paradigm for providing
evidence of statistical-computational gaps across a variety of high-dimensional
statistical models [Wein25]. For detection problems -- where the goal is to
test a planted distribution $\mathbb{P}'$ against a null distribution
$\mathbb{P}$ with independent components -- the standard approach is to bound
the advantage using an $\mathbb{L}^2(\mathbb{P})$-orthonormal family of
polynomials. However, this method breaks down for estimation tasks or more
complex testing problems where $\mathbb{P}$ has some planted structures, so
that no simple $\mathbb{L}^2(\mathbb{P})$-orthogonal polynomial family is
available. To address this challenge, several technical workarounds have been
proposed [SW22,SW25], though their implementation can be delicate. In this
work, we propose a more direct proof strategy. Focusing on random graph models,
we construct a basis of polynomials that is almost orthonormal under
$\mathbb{P}$, in precisely those regimes where statistical-computational gaps
arise. This almost orthonormal basis not only yields a direct route to
establishing low-degree lower bounds, but also allows us to explicitly identify
the polynomials that optimize the low-degree criterion. This, in turn, provides
insights into the design of optimal polynomial-time algorithms. We illustrate
the effectiveness of our approach by recovering known low-degree lower bounds,
and establishing new ones for problems such as hidden subcliques, stochastic
block models, and seriation models.

TL;DR: 基于物理约束的激光波形反法框架，通过在损失函数中集成波动方程约束，提升了神经网络算子FWI的反法稳定性和清晰度，同时保持计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统全波形反法(FWI)存在分辨率低、计算成本高的问题，而现有的神经网络算子方法虽然效率高但反法性能噪声大、不稳定。

Method: 在FWI损失函数中集成物理约束项，通过检验波场是否遵循波动方程物理法则来提升反法质量，减少噪声和伪影。

Result: 在OpenFWI和Overthrust模型上的数值实验表明，该方法能够获得比传统方法更清漂、更准确的地下速度模型，反法性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持计算效率的同时显著提高了FWI的反法质量，为实时地下监测应用提供了重要技术进步。

Abstract: Full waveform inversion (FWI) is crucial for reconstructing high-resolution
subsurface models, but it is often hindered, considering the limited data, by
its null space resulting in low-resolution models, and more importantly, by its
computational cost, especially if needed for real-time applications. Recent
attempts to accelerate FWI using learned wavefield neural operators have shown
promise in efficiency and differentiability, but typically suffer from noisy
and unstable inversion performance. To address these limitations, we introduce
a novel physics-informed FWI framework to enhance the inversion in accuracy
while maintaining the efficiency of neural operator-based FWI. Instead of
relying only on the L2 norm objective function via automatic differentiation,
resulting in noisy model reconstruction, we integrate a physics constraint term
in the loss function of FWI, improving the quality of the inverted velocity
models. Specifically, starting with an initial model to simulate wavefields and
then evaluating the loss over how much the resulting wavefield obeys the
physical laws (wave equation) and matches the recorded data, we achieve a
reduction in noise and artifacts. Numerical experiments using the OpenFWI and
Overthrust models demonstrate our method's superior performance, offering
cleaner and more accurate subsurface velocity than vanilla approaches.
Considering the efficiency of the approach compared to FWI, this advancement
represents a significant step forward in the practical application of FWI for
real-time subsurface monitoring.

Motivation: 现实应用中缺乏真实社区信息，没有统一的社区检测标准，且算法选择对下游任务的影响不明确，需要系统评估不同方法的影响

Method: 提出一个能够整合多种社区检测方法的框架，用于系统评估这些方法对下游任务结果的影响

Result: 比较分析显示特定社区检测算法在某些应用中产生更优结果，表明方法选择对性能有显著影响

Conclusion: 社区检测算法的选择确实显著影响下游应用性能，需要根据具体应用场景选择合适的算法

Abstract: In real-world scenarios, large graphs represent relationships among entities
in complex systems. Mining these large graphs often containing millions of
nodes and edges helps uncover structural patterns and meaningful insights.
Dividing a large graph into smaller subgraphs facilitates complex system
analysis by revealing local information. Community detection extracts clusters
or communities of graphs based on statistical methods and machine learning
models using various optimization techniques. Structure based community
detection methods are more suitable for applying to graphs because they do not
rely heavily on rich node or edge attribute information. The features derived
from these communities can improve downstream graph mining tasks, such as link
prediction and node classification. In real-world applications, we often lack
ground truth community information. Additionally, there is neither a
universally accepted gold standard for community detection nor a single method
that is consistently optimal across diverse applications. In many cases, it is
unclear how practitioners select community detection methods, and choices are
often made without explicitly considering their potential impact on downstream
tasks. In this study, we investigate whether the choice of community detection
algorithm significantly influences the performance of downstream applications.
We propose a framework capable of integrating various community detection
methods to systematically evaluate their effects on downstream task outcomes.
Our comparative analysis reveals that specific community detection algorithms
yield superior results in certain applications, highlighting that method
selection substantially affects performance.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的音频深度伪造检测评估框架，解决传统评估方法中合成器样本不均衡和真实语音类型缺乏多样性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统音频深度伪造检测评估存在两个主要问题：1）使用均误率（EER）作为单一指标时，样本量较多的合成器会占据不成比例的权重；2）大多数数据集真实语音类型单一，无法模拟真实场景。

Method: 提出真实跨测试框架，包含多样化的真实语音数据集，并通过聚合多个EER值来进行更均衡的评估。对超150个合成器和九种真实语音类型进行了基准测试。

Result: 该方法与传统评估方法相比，提高了模型的稳健性和可解释性。同时释放了新的数据集以促进进一步研究。

Conclusion: 真实跨测试框架为音频深度伪造检测领域提供了更加全面和可靠的评估方法，有助于更好地模拟真实世界条件下的检测性能。

Abstract: Audio deepfake detection (ADD) models are commonly evaluated using datasets
that combine multiple synthesizers, with performance reported as a single Equal
Error Rate (EER). However, this approach disproportionately weights
synthesizers with more samples, underrepresenting others and reducing the
overall reliability of EER. Additionally, most ADD datasets lack diversity in
bona fide speech, often featuring a single environment and speech style (e.g.,
clean read speech), limiting their ability to simulate real-world conditions.
To address these challenges, we propose bona fide cross-testing, a novel
evaluation framework that incorporates diverse bona fide datasets and
aggregates EERs for more balanced assessments. Our approach improves robustness
and interpretability compared to traditional evaluation methods. We benchmark
over 150 synthesizers across nine bona fide speech types and release a new
dataset to facilitate further research at

Conclusion: DiFlow-TTS证明了纯离散流匹配在语音合成中的有效性，为高质量、高效率的零样本TTS提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) aims to synthesize high-quality speech that
mimics the voice of an unseen speaker using only a short reference sample,
requiring not only speaker adaptation but also accurate modeling of prosodic
attributes. Recent approaches based on language models, diffusion, and flow
matching have shown promising results in zero-shot TTS, but still suffer from
slow inference and repetition artifacts. Discrete codec representations have
been widely adopted for speech synthesis, and recent works have begun to
explore diffusion models in purely discrete settings, suggesting the potential
of discrete generative modeling for speech synthesis. However, existing
flow-matching methods typically embed these discrete tokens into a continuous
space and apply continuous flow matching, which may not fully leverage the
advantages of discrete representations. To address these challenges, we
introduce DiFlow-TTS, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first model
to explore purely Discrete Flow Matching for speech synthesis. DiFlow-TTS
explicitly models factorized speech attributes within a compact and unified
architecture. It leverages in-context learning by conditioning on textual
content, along with prosodic and acoustic attributes extracted from a reference
speech, enabling effective attribute cloning in a zero-shot setting. In
addition, the model employs a factorized flow prediction mechanism with
distinct heads for prosody and acoustic details, allowing it to learn
aspect-specific distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that DiFlow-TTS
achieves promising performance in several key metrics, including naturalness,
prosody, preservation of speaker style, and energy control. It also maintains a
compact model size and achieves low-latency inference, generating speech up to
25.8 times faster than the latest existing baselines.

Abstract: In this technical report, we describe our submission for Task 1,
Low-Complexity Device-Robust Acoustic Scene Classification, of the DCASE 2025
Challenge. Our work tackles the dual challenges of strict complexity
constraints and robust generalization to both seen and unseen devices, while
also leveraging the new rule allowing the use of device labels at test time.
Our proposed system is based on a knowledge distillation framework where an
efficient CP-MobileNet student learns from a compact, specialized two-teacher
ensemble. This ensemble combines a baseline PaSST teacher, trained with
standard cross-entropy, and a 'generalization expert' teacher. This expert is
trained using our novel Device-Aware Feature Alignment (DAFA) loss, adapted
from prior work, which explicitly structures the feature space for device
robustness. To capitalize on the availability of test-time device labels, the
distilled student model then undergoes a final device-specific fine-tuning
stage. Our proposed system achieves a final accuracy of 57.93\% on the
development set, demonstrating a significant improvement over the official
baseline, particularly on unseen devices.

Method: 提出基于FSQ的NeuCodec编解码器，通过编码器蒸馏实验验证不同编码器可产生不同但等价的编码序列，并对比RVQ和FSQ在模拟噪声信道传输中的性能

Result: FSQ编码具有内置冗余特性，两个不同编码器可学习到差异很大但重建质量相当的编码序列；FSQ在比特级扰动鲁棒性方面显著优于RVQ

Conclusion: FSQ为基础的神经音频编解码器在噪声信道环境下具有明显优势，其内置冗余特性提供了更好的传输鲁棒性，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Neural Audio Codecs (NACs) have become increasingly adopted in speech
processing tasks due to their excellent rate-distortion performance and
compatibility with Large Language Models (LLMs) as discrete feature
representations for audio generation. While most existing codecs rely on
Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ), Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) has
recently emerged as a compelling alternative that simplifies training and
natively supports single codebooks. We introduce NeuCodec, an FSQ-based NAC,
and show that FSQ encodes baked-in redundancy which produces an encoding which
is robust when transmitted through noisy channels. First, through an encoder
distillation experiment, we show that two different encoders can learn to
encode identical audio into vastly different code sequences whilst maintaining
comparable reconstruction quality with the same quantizer and decoder. Second,
we demonstrate that FSQ has vastly superior bit-level perturbation robustness
by comparing the performance of RVQ and FSQ codecs when simulating the
transmission of code sequences through a noisy channel.

Abstract: The diffusion MRI Neurite Exchange Imaging model offers a promising framework
for probing gray matter microstructure by estimating parameters such as
compartment sizes, diffusivities, and inter-compartmental water exchange time.
However, existing protocols require long scan times. This study proposes a
reduced acquisition scheme for the Connectome 2.0 scanner that preserves model
accuracy while substantially shortening scan duration. We developed a
data-driven framework using explainable artificial intelligence with a guided
recursive feature elimination strategy to identify an optimal 8-feature subset
from a 15-feature protocol. The performance of this optimized protocol was
validated in vivo and benchmarked against the full acquisition and alternative
reduction strategies. Parameter accuracy, preservation of anatomical contrast,
and test-retest reproducibility were assessed. The reduced protocol yielded
parameter estimates and cortical maps comparable to the full protocol, with low
estimation errors in synthetic data and minimal impact on test-retest
variability. Compared to theory-driven and heuristic reduction schemes, the
optimized protocol demonstrated superior robustness, reducing the deviation in
water exchange time estimates by over two-fold. In conclusion, this hybrid
optimization framework enables viable imaging of neurite exchange in 14 minutes
without loss of parameter fidelity. This approach supports the broader
application of exchange-sensitive diffusion magnetic resonance imaging in
neuroscience and clinical research, and offers a generalizable method for
designing efficient acquisition protocols in biophysical parameter mapping.

Motivation: 解决TEE中高推理延迟问题，以及分层分割方案中非线性层导致的高通信开销；同时免除差分隐私方案中随机噪声对大语言模型性能和语义理解的负面影响。

Method: 在客户端TEE中保密部署嵌入层，将后续层放置在GPU服务器上；优化Report-Noisy-Max机制，以轻微的模型性能下降为代价保护敏感输入数据。

Result: 在Llama系列模型上的实验表明，CMIF能够有效减少TEE中的额外推理开销，同时保持用户数据隐私。

Conclusion: CMIF框架成功解决了TEE高延迟和DP性能下降的问题，提供了一种既保密又高效的模型推理方案。

Abstract: CPU-based trusted execution environments (TEEs) and differential privacy (DP)
have gained wide applications for private inference. Due to high inference
latency in TEEs, researchers use partition-based approaches that offload linear
model components to GPUs. However, dense nonlinear layers of large language
models (LLMs) result in significant communication overhead between TEEs and
GPUs. DP-based approaches apply random noise to protect data privacy, but this
compromises LLM performance and semantic understanding. To overcome the above
drawbacks, this paper proposes CMIF, a Confidential and efficient Model
Inference Framework. CMIF confidentially deploys the embedding layer in the
client-side TEE and subsequent layers on GPU servers. Meanwhile, it optimizes
the Report-Noisy-Max mechanism to protect sensitive inputs with a slight
decrease in model performance. Extensive experiments on Llama-series models
demonstrate that CMIF reduces additional inference overhead in TEEs while
preserving user data privacy.

Abstract: As on-device large language model (LLM) systems become increasingly
prevalent, federated fine-tuning enables advanced language understanding and
generation directly on edge devices; however, it also involves processing
sensitive, user-specific data, raising significant privacy concerns within the
federated learning framework. To address these challenges, we propose
DP-FedLoRA, a privacy-enhanced federated fine-tuning framework that integrates
LoRA-based adaptation with differential privacy in a communication-efficient
setting. Each client locally clips and perturbs its LoRA matrices using
Gaussian noise to satisfy ($\epsilon$, $\delta$)-differential privacy. We
further provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating the unbiased nature of the
updates and deriving bounds on the variance introduced by noise, offering
practical guidance for privacy-budget calibration. Experimental results across
mainstream benchmarks show that DP-FedLoRA delivers competitive performance
while offering strong privacy guarantees, paving the way for scalable and
privacy-preserving LLM deployment in on-device environments.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) watermarking embeds detectable signals into
generated text for copyright protection, misuse prevention, and content
detection. While prior studies evaluate robustness using watermark removal
attacks, these methods are often suboptimal, creating the misconception that
effective removal requires large perturbations or powerful adversaries.
  To bridge the gap, we first formalize the system model for LLM watermark, and
characterize two realistic threat models constrained on limited access to the
watermark detector. We then analyze how different types of perturbation vary in
their attack range, i.e., the number of tokens they can affect with a single
edit. We observe that character-level perturbations (e.g., typos, swaps,
deletions, homoglyphs) can influence multiple tokens simultaneously by
disrupting the tokenization process. We demonstrate that character-level
perturbations are significantly more effective for watermark removal under the
most restrictive threat model. We further propose guided removal attacks based
on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) that uses a reference detector for optimization.
Under a practical threat model with limited black-box queries to the watermark
detector, our method demonstrates strong removal performance. Experiments
confirm the superiority of character-level perturbations and the effectiveness
of the GA in removing watermarks under realistic constraints. Additionally, we
argue there is an adversarial dilemma when considering potential defenses: any
fixed defense can be bypassed by a suitable perturbation strategy. Motivated by
this principle, we propose an adaptive compound character-level attack.
Experimental results show that this approach can effectively defeat the
defenses. Our findings highlight significant vulnerabilities in existing LLM
watermark schemes and underline the urgency for the development of new robust
mechanisms.

Abstract: Secure inference enables privacy-preserving machine learning by leveraging
cryptographic protocols that support computations on sensitive user data
without exposing it. However, integrating cryptographic protocols with large
language models (LLMs) presents significant challenges, as the inherent
complexity of these protocols, together with LLMs' massive parameter scale and
sophisticated architectures, severely limits practical usability. In this work,
we propose ENSI, a novel non-interactive secure inference framework for LLMs,
based on the principle of co-designing the cryptographic protocols and LLM
architecture. ENSI employs an optimized encoding strategy that seamlessly
integrates CKKS scheme with a lightweight LLM variant, BitNet, significantly
reducing the computational complexity of encrypted matrix multiplications. In
response to the prohibitive computational demands of softmax under homomorphic
encryption (HE), we pioneer the integration of the sigmoid attention mechanism
with HE as a seamless, retraining-free alternative. Furthermore, by embedding
the Bootstrapping operation within the RMSNorm process, we efficiently refresh
ciphertexts while markedly decreasing the frequency of costly bootstrapping
invocations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that ENSI achieves
approximately an 8x acceleration in matrix multiplications and a 2.6x speedup
in softmax inference on CPU compared to state-of-the-art method, with the
proportion of bootstrapping is reduced to just 1%.

Abstract: Diffusion models have significantly advanced text-to-image generation,
enabling the creation of highly realistic images conditioned on textual prompts
and seeds. Given the considerable intellectual and economic value embedded in
such prompts, prompt theft poses a critical security and privacy concern. In
this paper, we investigate prompt-stealing attacks targeting diffusion models.
We reveal that numerical optimization-based prompt recovery methods are
fundamentally limited as they do not account for the initial random noise used
during image generation. We identify and exploit a noise-generation
vulnerability (CWE-339), prevalent in major image-generation frameworks,
originating from PyTorch's restriction of seed values to a range of $2^{32}$
when generating the initial random noise on CPUs. Through a large-scale
empirical analysis conducted on images shared via the popular platform CivitAI,
we demonstrate that approximately 95% of these images' seed values can be
effectively brute-forced in 140 minutes per seed using our seed-recovery tool,
SeedSnitch. Leveraging the recovered seed, we propose PromptPirate, a genetic
algorithm-based optimization method explicitly designed for prompt stealing.
PromptPirate surpasses state-of-the-art methods, i.e., PromptStealer, P2HP, and
CLIP-Interrogator, achieving an 8-11% improvement in LPIPS similarity.
Furthermore, we introduce straightforward and effective countermeasures that
render seed stealing, and thus optimization-based prompt stealing, ineffective.
We have disclosed our findings responsibly and initiated coordinated mitigation
efforts with the developers to address this critical vulnerability.

Abstract: Supervised machine learning techniques rely on labeled data to achieve high
task performance, but this requires the labels to capture some meaningful
differences in the underlying data structure. For training network intrusion
detection algorithms, most datasets contain a series of attack classes and a
single large benign class which captures all non-attack network traffic. A
review of intrusion detection papers and guides that explicitly state their
data preprocessing steps identified that the majority took the labeled
categories of the dataset at face value when training their algorithms. The
present paper evaluates the structure of benign traffic in several common
intrusion detection datasets (NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CIC-IDS 2017) and
determines whether there are meaningful sub-categories within this traffic
which may improve overall multi-classification performance using common machine
learning techniques. We present an overview of some unsupervised clustering
techniques (e.g., HDBSCAN, Mean Shift Clustering) and show how they
differentially cluster the benign traffic space.

Abstract: We propose REpresentation-Aware Distributionally Robust Estimation (READ), a
novel framework for Wasserstein distributionally robust learning that accounts
for predictive representations when guarding against distributional shifts.
Unlike classical approaches that treat all feature perturbations equally, READ
embeds a multidimensional alignment parameter into the transport cost, allowing
the model to differentially discourage perturbations along directions
associated with informative representations. This yields robustness to feature
variation while preserving invariant structure. Our first contribution is a
theoretical foundation: we show that seminorm regularizations for linear
regression and binary classification arise as Wasserstein distributionally
robust objectives, thereby providing tractable reformulations of READ and
unifying a broad class of regularized estimators under the DRO lens. Second, we
adopt a principled procedure for selecting the Wasserstein radius using the
techniques of robust Wasserstein profile inference. This further enables the
construction of valid, representation-aware confidence regions for model
parameters with distinct geometric features. Finally, we analyze the geometry
of READ estimators as the alignment parameters vary and propose an optimization
algorithm to estimate the projection of the global optimum onto this solution
surface. This procedure selects among equally robust estimators while optimally
constructing a representation structure. We conclude by demonstrating the
effectiveness of our framework through extensive simulations and a real-world
study, providing a powerful robust estimation grounded in learning
representation.

Abstract: Accurate measurement of images produced by electronic displays is critical
for the evaluation of both traditional and computational displays. Traditional
display measurement methods based on sparse radiometric sampling and fitting a
model are inadequate for capturing spatially varying display artifacts, as they
fail to capture high-frequency and pixel-level distortions. While cameras offer
sufficient spatial resolution, they introduce optical, sampling, and
photometric distortions. Furthermore, the physical measurement must be combined
with a model of a visual system to assess whether the distortions are going to
be visible. To enable perceptual assessment of displays, we propose a
combination of a camera-based reconstruction pipeline with a visual difference
predictor, which account for both the inaccuracy of camera measurements and
visual difference prediction. The reconstruction pipeline combines HDR image
stacking, MTF inversion, vignetting correction, geometric undistortion,
homography transformation, and color correction, enabling cameras to function
as precise display measurement instruments. By incorporating a Visual
Difference Predictor (VDP), our system models the visibility of various stimuli
under different viewing conditions for the human visual system. We validate the
proposed CameraVDP framework through three applications: defective pixel
detection, color fringing awareness, and display non-uniformity evaluation. Our
uncertainty analysis framework enables the estimation of the theoretical upper
bound for defect pixel detection performance and provides confidence intervals
for VDP quality scores.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative machine learning, powered by massive
computational resources, have demonstrated unprecedented human-like
capabilities. While beyond-classical quantum experiments can generate samples
from classically intractable distributions, their complexity has thwarted all
efforts toward efficient learning. This challenge has hindered demonstrations
of generative quantum advantage: the ability of quantum computers to learn and
generate desired outputs substantially better than classical computers. We
resolve this challenge by introducing families of generative quantum models
that are hard to simulate classically, are efficiently trainable, exhibit no
barren plateaus or proliferating local minima, and can learn to generate
distributions beyond the reach of classical computers. Using a $68$-qubit
superconducting quantum processor, we demonstrate these capabilities in two
scenarios: learning classically intractable probability distributions and
learning quantum circuits for accelerated physical simulation. Our results
establish that both learning and sampling can be performed efficiently in the
beyond-classical regime, opening new possibilities for quantum-enhanced
generative models with provable advantage.
