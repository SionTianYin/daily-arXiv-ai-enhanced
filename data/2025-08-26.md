### [1] [GreenTEA: Gradient Descent with Topic-modeling and Evolutionary Auto-prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16603)
*Zheng Dong,Luming Shang,Gabriela Olinto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GreenTEA是一种基于遗传算法和智能代理的自动提示优化方法，通过平衡探索和利用来高效优化LLM提示，在多个基准测试中优于人工设计和现有自动方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动设计高质量提示需要大量领域专业知识且难以扩展，现有自动方法要么计算成本高（过度探索），要么容易陷入局部最优（过度利用）。

Method: 使用智能代理协作工作流：分析代理通过主题建模识别错误模式，生成代理针对性修订提示，在遗传算法框架下通过交叉和变异操作进化候选提示。

Result: 在逻辑推理、定量推理、常识和伦理决策等多个公共基准数据集上，GreenTEA表现优于人工设计的提示和现有最先进的自动提示优化方法。

Conclusion: GreenTEA通过平衡探索和利用，提供了一种高效且有效的自动提示优化解决方案，能够显著提升LLM在各种任务上的性能。

Abstract: High-quality prompts are crucial for Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve
exceptional performance. However, manually crafting effective prompts is
labor-intensive and demands significant domain expertise, limiting its
scalability. Existing automatic prompt optimization methods either extensively
explore new prompt candidates, incurring high computational costs due to
inefficient searches within a large solution space, or overly exploit feedback
on existing prompts, risking suboptimal optimization because of the complex
prompt landscape. To address these challenges, we introduce GreenTEA, an
agentic LLM workflow for automatic prompt optimization that balances candidate
exploration and knowledge exploitation. It leverages a collaborative team of
agents to iteratively refine prompts based on feedback from error samples. An
analyzing agent identifies common error patterns resulting from the current
prompt via topic modeling, and a generation agent revises the prompt to
directly address these key deficiencies. This refinement process is guided by a
genetic algorithm framework, which simulates natural selection by evolving
candidate prompts through operations such as crossover and mutation to
progressively optimize model performance. Extensive numerical experiments
conducted on public benchmark datasets suggest the superior performance of
GreenTEA against human-engineered prompts and existing state-of-the-arts for
automatic prompt optimization, covering logical and quantitative reasoning,
commonsense, and ethical decision-making.

### [2] [Cognitive Decision Routing in Large Language Models: When to Think Fast, When to Think Slow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16636)
*Y. Du,C. Guo,W. Wang,G. Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了基于双过程理论的认知决策路由框架，动态选择快速直觉或深度推理策略，在降低34%计算成本的同时提升推理性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在面对不同查询时要么统一使用深度推理（计算昂贵）要么统一使用快速响应（准确性不足）的问题，受人类认知双过程理论启发

Method: 引入元认知层分析查询复杂度（信息相关性、领域边界、利益相关者数量、不确定性），动态决定推理策略的CDR框架

Result: 计算成本降低34%，专业判断任务一致性提升23%，专家级评估准确率提升18%

Conclusion: 将认知科学原理与AI系统设计结合，为LLMs提供了自适应的原则性推理方法

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face a fundamental challenge in deciding when to
rely on rapid, intuitive responses versus engaging in slower, more deliberate
reasoning. Inspired by Daniel Kahneman's dual-process theory and his insights
on human cognitive biases, we propose a novel Cognitive Decision Routing (CDR)
framework that dynamically determines the appropriate reasoning strategy based
on query characteristics. Our approach addresses the current limitations where
models either apply uniform reasoning depth or rely on computationally
expensive methods for all queries. We introduce a meta-cognitive layer that
analyzes query complexity through multiple dimensions: correlation strength
between given information and required conclusions, domain boundary crossings,
stakeholder multiplicity, and uncertainty levels. Through extensive experiments
on diverse reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that CDR achieves superior
performance while reducing computational costs by 34\% compared to uniform deep
reasoning approaches. Our framework shows particular strength in professional
judgment tasks, achieving 23\% improvement in consistency and 18\% better
accuracy on expert-level evaluations. This work bridges cognitive science
principles with practical AI system design, offering a principled approach to
adaptive reasoning in LLMs.

### [3] [Trust but Verify! A Survey on Verification Design for Test-time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16665)
*V Venktesh,Mandeep rathee,Avishek Anand*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文是一个关于验证器在测试时扩展中应用的综述，统一了验证器训练方法、类型和应用场景的视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然验证器在测试时扩展中广泛采用，但缺乏对各种验证方法的系统收集、分类和讨论。

Method: 通过调研文献中的多样化验证方法，提出统一的验证器训练、类型和应用框架。

Result: 完整覆盖了各种验证器方法，包括提示基、判别式和生成式模型，以及对过程路径和结果的验证。

Conclusion: 验证器方法作为一种参数免调整的推理时扩展方案，能够显著提升大语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a new frontier for scaling the
performance of Large Language Models. In test-time scaling, by using more
computational resources during inference, LLMs can improve their reasoning
process and task performance. Several approaches have emerged for TTS such as
distilling reasoning traces from another model or exploring the vast decoding
search space by employing a verifier. The verifiers serve as reward models that
help score the candidate outputs from the decoding process to diligently
explore the vast solution space and select the best outcome. This paradigm
commonly termed has emerged as a superior approach owing to parameter free
scaling at inference time and high performance gains. The verifiers could be
prompt-based, fine-tuned as a discriminative or generative model to verify
process paths, outcomes or both. Despite their widespread adoption, there is no
detailed collection, clear categorization and discussion of diverse
verification approaches and their training mechanisms. In this survey, we cover
the diverse approaches in the literature and present a unified view of verifier
training, types and their utility in test-time scaling. Our repository can be

### [4] [Do Cognitively Interpretable Reasoning Traces Improve LLM Performance?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16695)
*Siddhant Bhambri,Upasana Biswas,Subbarao Kambhampati*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现CoT推理迹跡的可解释性与任务性能存在明显反比：DeepSeek R1迹跡性能最优但人类评估可解释性最差


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索CoT推理迹跡是否必须具有可解释性才能提升LLM任务性能，对传统假设进行验证

Method: 在开放图书QA领域，使用LLaMA和Qwen模型在4类推理迹跡上进行监督微调：DeepSeek R1迹跡、R1摘要、R1后解释和算法生成的可验证迹跡，并进行100人的人类可解释性评估

Result: 微调R1迹跡的模型性能最优，但人类评估显示其可解释性最低；算法生成迹跡可解释性最高但性能最差

Conclusion: 中间迹跡与终端用户可解释性可以解耦，性能优化不必强求迹跡的可解释性

Abstract: Recent progress in reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) has been
driven by introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces, where models generate
intermediate reasoning traces before producing an answer. These traces, as in
DeepSeek R1, are not only used to guide inference but also serve as supervision
signals for distillation into smaller models. A common but often implicit
assumption is that CoT traces should be semantically meaningful and
interpretable to the end user. While recent research questions the need for
semantic nature of these traces, in this paper, we ask: ``\textit{Must CoT
reasoning traces be interpretable to enhance LLM task performance?}" We
investigate this question in the Open Book Question-Answering domain by
supervised fine-tuning LLaMA and Qwen models on four types of reasoning traces:
(1) DeepSeek R1 traces, (2) LLM-generated summaries of R1 traces, (3)
LLM-generated post-hoc explanations of R1 traces, and (4) algorithmically
generated verifiably correct traces. To quantify the trade-off between
interpretability and performance, we further conduct a human-subject study with
100 participants rating the interpretability of each trace type. Our results
reveal a striking mismatch: while fine-tuning on R1 traces yields the strongest
performance, participants judged these traces to be the least interpretable.
These findings suggest that it is useful to decouple intermediate tokens from
end user interpretability.

### [5] [QueryBandits for Hallucination Mitigation: Exploiting Semantic Features for No-Regret Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16697)
*Nicole Cho,William Watson,Alec Koppel,Sumitra Ganesh,Manuela Veloso*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QueryBandits是一个基于多臂老虎机框架的查询重写系统，通过分析17个语言特征来主动减少LLM幻觉，在13个QA基准测试中显著优于无重写基线和静态提示方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数缓解LLM幻觉的工作侧重于事后过滤，而不是在触发幻觉之前通过查询重写来主动预防。

Method: 使用多臂老虎机框架设计重写策略，最大化基于17个语言特征敏感度的奖励模型，通过Thompson Sampling等算法主动引导LLM避免生成幻觉内容。

Result: 在13个多样化QA基准测试和1050个词汇扰动查询上，QueryBandits比无重写基线获得87.5%的胜率，比零样本静态提示方法分别高出42.6%和60.3%。

Conclusion: QueryBandits通过查询重写干预有效缓解幻觉，证明静态重写策略可能加剧幻觉，而基于语义特征的引导重写可以显著改变输出行为，无需重新训练或基于梯度的适配。

Abstract: Advanced reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) have caused
higher hallucination prevalence; yet most mitigation work focuses on
after-the-fact filtering rather than shaping the queries that trigger them. We
introduce QueryBandits, a bandit framework that designs rewrite strategies to
maximize a reward model, that encapsulates hallucination propensity based upon
the sensitivities of 17 linguistic features of the input query-and therefore,
proactively steer LLMs away from generating hallucinations. Across 13 diverse
QA benchmarks and 1,050 lexically perturbed queries per dataset, our top
contextual QueryBandit (Thompson Sampling) achieves an 87.5% win rate over a
no-rewrite baseline and also outperforms zero-shot static prompting
("paraphrase" or "expand") by 42.6% and 60.3% respectively. Therefore, we
empirically substantiate the effectiveness of QueryBandits in mitigating
hallucination via the intervention that takes the form of a query rewrite.
Interestingly, certain static prompting strategies, which constitute a
considerable number of current query rewriting literature, have a higher
cumulative regret than the no-rewrite baseline, signifying that static rewrites
can worsen hallucination. Moreover, we discover that the converged per-arm
regression feature weight vectors substantiate that there is no single rewrite
strategy optimal for all queries. In this context, guided rewriting via
exploiting semantic features with QueryBandits can induce significant shifts in
output behavior through forward-pass mechanisms, bypassing the need for
retraining or gradient-based adaptation.

### [6] [Assessing Consciousness-Related Behaviors in Large Language Models Using the Maze Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16705)
*Rui A. Pimenta,Tim Schlippe,Kristina Schaaff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过迷宫测试研究大语言模型的类意识行为，发现具备推理能力的LLM在空间感知、视角转换等意识相关特征上表现更好，但仍缺乏持续连贯的自我意识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型是否展现出类意识行为，通过迷宫测试同时探测空间意识、视角转换、目标导向行为和时序排序等关键意识特征。

Method: 将意识理论综合为13个基本特征，在零样本、单样本和少样本学习场景下评估12个主流LLM，使用迷宫导航任务从第一人称视角测试模型。

Result: 推理能力强的LLM表现优于标准版本，Gemini 2.0 Pro达到52.9%完整路径准确率，DeepSeek-R1达到80.5%部分路径准确率，但指标间差距表明LLM难以维持连贯的自我模型。

Conclusion: 虽然LLM通过推理机制在意识相关行为上取得进展，但仍缺乏意识特有的整合性、持续性自我意识。

Abstract: We investigate consciousness-like behaviors in Large Language Models (LLMs)
using the Maze Test, challenging models to navigate mazes from a first-person
perspective. This test simultaneously probes spatial awareness,
perspective-taking, goal-directed behavior, and temporal sequencing-key
consciousness-associated characteristics. After synthesizing consciousness
theories into 13 essential characteristics, we evaluated 12 leading LLMs across
zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning scenarios. Results showed
reasoning-capable LLMs consistently outperforming standard versions, with
Gemini 2.0 Pro achieving 52.9% Complete Path Accuracy and DeepSeek-R1 reaching
80.5% Partial Path Accuracy. The gap between these metrics indicates LLMs
struggle to maintain coherent self-models throughout solutions -- a fundamental
consciousness aspect. While LLMs show progress in consciousness-related
behaviors through reasoning mechanisms, they lack the integrated, persistent
self-awareness characteristic of consciousness.

### [7] [Sparse and Dense Retrievers Learn Better Together: Joint Sparse-Dense Optimization for Text-Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16707)
*Jonghyun Song,Youngjune Lee,Gyu-Hwung Cho,Ilhyeon Song,Saehun Kim,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种通过自我知识萌发实现密集和稀疏表征双向学习的简单有效框架，在保持稀疏模型优势的同时达到类似或更好于密集模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然学习型稀疏检索(LSR)在多模态领域有一定进展，但现有方法多依赖计算成本高的对比预训练或来自冻结密集模型的知识萌发，限制了两种表征形式之间的相互增强。

Method: 提出使用集成相似性识别分(密集和稀疏相似性的加权和)作为共享的教师信号，通过自我知识萌发实现双向学习。仅微调密集编码器的最后一层和稀疏投影头，以保证效率。

Result: 在MSCOCO和Flickr30k数据集上的实验表明，稀疏检索器不仅超过现有稀疏基线模型，而且达到了类似或更好于密集对应模型的性能，同时保持了稀疏模型的优势。

Conclusion: 该框架通过双向学习机制有效地结合了密集和稀疏表征的优势，为现有VLP模型提供了一种高效的适配方案，在保持稀疏检索效率和可解释性的同时实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Pretrained (VLP) models have achieved impressive performance
on multimodal tasks, including text-image retrieval, based on dense
representations. Meanwhile, Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) has gained traction
in text-only settings due to its interpretability and efficiency with fast
term-based lookup via inverted indexes. Inspired by these advantages, recent
work has extended LSR to the multimodal domain. However, these methods often
rely on computationally expensive contrastive pre-training, or distillation
from a frozen dense model, which limits the potential for mutual enhancement.
To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective framework that
enables bi-directional learning between dense and sparse representations
through Self-Knowledge Distillation. This bi-directional learning is achieved
using an integrated similarity score-a weighted sum of dense and sparse
similarities-which serves as a shared teacher signal for both representations.
To ensure efficiency, we fine-tune the final layer of the dense encoder and the
sparse projection head, enabling easy adaptation of any existing VLP model.
Experiments on MSCOCO and Flickr30k demonstrate that our sparse retriever not
only outperforms existing sparse baselines, but also achieves performance
comparable to-or even surpassing-its dense counterparts, while retaining the
benefits of sparse models.

### [8] [Error Reflection Prompting: Can Large Language Models Successfully Understand Errors?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16729)
*Jason Li,Lauren Yraola,Kevin Zhu,Sean O'Brien*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了错误反思提示（ERP）方法，在思维链基础上增加错误识别和纠正机制，提升语言模型的推理能力和错误识别能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有思维链方法缺乏反思和纠错能力，容易延续错误。受人类反思能力的启发，需要开发能够识别和纠正推理错误的提示方法

Method: 基于思维链构建ERP方法，包含错误答案、错误识别和正确答案三个步骤。通过自动生成错误轮廓，让模型能够识别错误类型和错误步骤

Result: ERP作为传统思维链的有效补充，能够提升推理的鲁棒性和能力，同时增加模型错误产生过程的可解释性

Conclusion: 错误反思提示方法显著增强了语言模型的推理能力，实现了错误识别和纠正的自动化，提高了推理过程的可靠性和可扩展性

Abstract: Prompting methods for language models, such as Chain-of-thought (CoT),
present intuitive step-by-step processes for problem solving. These
methodologies aim to equip models with a better understanding of the correct
procedures for addressing a given task. Despite these advancements, CoT lacks
the ability of reflection and error correction, potentially causing a model to
perpetuate mistakes and errors. Therefore, inspired by the human ability for
said tasks, we propose Error Reflection Prompting (ERP) to further enhance
reasoning in language models. Building upon CoT, ERP is a method comprised of
an incorrect answer, error recognition, and a correct answer. This process
enables the model to recognize types of errors and the steps that lead to
incorrect answers, allowing the model to better discern which steps to avoid
and which to take. The model is able to generate the error outlines itself with
automated ERP generation, allowing for error recognition and correction to be
integrated into the reasoning chain and produce scalability and reliability in
the process. The results demonstrate that ERP serves as a versatile supplement
to conventional CoT, ultimately contributing to more robust and capable
reasoning abilities along with increased interpretability in how models
ultimately reach their errors.

*Nitin Gupta,Pallav Koppisetti,Kausik Lakkaraju,Biplav Srivastava*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GAICo是一个开源的Python库，为生成式AI输出比较提供统一、可扩展的框架，支持多模态和多格式的标准化评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在关键领域的快速应用需要稳健且可复现的评估方法，但现有方法存在碎片化、非标准化问题，阻碍了系统开发和比较。

Method: 开发GAICo库，提供高层次API进行端到端分析，支持无结构文本、结构化数据和多媒体（图像、音频）的参考基准评估指标。

Result: 通过多模态AI旅行助手案例研究验证了工具实用性，发布后4个月内下载量超过1.3万次，显示了社区的高度兴趣。

Conclusion: GAICo使AI研究者和开发者能够高效评估系统性能，实现可复现评估，提高开发速度，构建更可信的AI系统。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Generative AI (GenAI) into diverse, high-stakes
domains necessitates robust and reproducible evaluation methods. However,
practitioners often resort to ad-hoc, non-standardized scripts, as common
metrics are often unsuitable for specialized, structured outputs (e.g.,
automated plans, time-series) or holistic comparison across modalities (e.g.,
text, audio, and image). This fragmentation hinders comparability and slows AI
system development. To address this challenge, we present GAICo (Generative AI
Comparator): a deployed, open-source Python library that streamlines and
standardizes GenAI output comparison. GAICo provides a unified, extensible
framework supporting a comprehensive suite of reference-based metrics for
unstructured text, specialized structured data formats, and multimedia (images,
audio). Its architecture features a high-level API for rapid, end-to-end
analysis, from multi-model comparison to visualization and reporting, alongside
direct metric access for granular control. We demonstrate GAICo's utility
through a detailed case study evaluating and debugging complex, multi-modal AI
Travel Assistant pipelines. GAICo empowers AI researchers and developers to
efficiently assess system performance, make evaluation reproducible, improve
development velocity, and ultimately build more trustworthy AI systems,
aligning with the goal of moving faster and safer in AI deployment. Since its
release on PyPI in Jun 2025, the tool has been downloaded over 13K times,
across versions, by Aug 2025, demonstrating growing community interest.

*Abdelrahman Abdallah,Bhawna Piryani,Jamshid Mozafari,Mohammed Ali,Adam Jatowt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统性评估了3类22种重排方法（LLM基于、轻量级和零检查）在信息检索任务中的性能，对比了它们在新查询上的演续性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过公平对比确定LLM基于重排方法与轻量级方法在新查询上是否存在性能差异，并探索其根本原因。

Method: 在TREC DL19、DL20、BEIR等标准测试集以及一个新查询数据集上评估40个变种的22种重排方法，分析训练数据重叠、模型结构和计算效率对性能的影响。

Result: 发现LLM基于重排器在熟悉查询上表现更优，但在新查询上的演续性能差异较大，轻量级模型具有相当的效率。

Conclusion: 查询的新领性显著影响重排效果，现有方法在演续性方面存在限制，需要更好地处理新查询场景。

Abstract: In this work, we present a systematic and comprehensive empirical evaluation
of state-of-the-art reranking methods, encompassing large language model
(LLM)-based, lightweight contextual, and zero-shot approaches, with respect to
their performance in information retrieval tasks. We evaluate in total 22
methods, including 40 variants (depending on used LLM) across several
established benchmarks, including TREC DL19, DL20, and BEIR, as well as a novel
dataset designed to test queries unseen by pretrained models. Our primary goal
is to determine, through controlled and fair comparisons, whether a performance
disparity exists between LLM-based rerankers and their lightweight
counterparts, particularly on novel queries, and to elucidate the underlying
causes of any observed differences. To disentangle confounding factors, we
analyze the effects of training data overlap, model architecture, and
computational efficiency on reranking performance. Our findings indicate that
while LLM-based rerankers demonstrate superior performance on familiar queries,
their generalization ability to novel queries varies, with lightweight models
offering comparable efficiency. We further identify that the novelty of queries
significantly impacts reranking effectiveness, highlighting limitations in
existing approaches.

### [11] [Toward Socially Aware Vision-Language Models: Evaluating Cultural Competence Through Multimodal Story Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16762)
*Arka Mukherjee,Shreya Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文首次系统性评估视觉-语言模型的文化能力，通过多模态故事生成任务发现模型在文化适应方面既有潜力也存在显著的限制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉-语言模型在多元文化环境中的普及，确保其文化能力成为责任任人工智能系统的关键需求。之前的研究仅考察了文本模型和对象识别任务，缺乏对多模态生成任务中文化身份符号的系统评估

Method: 开发了一个新的多模态框架，通过干扰文化身份来评估5个当代VLMs在故事生成下游任务中的表现，进行了跨模态评估和视觉-语义相似性分析

Result: 发现VLMs展现出显著的文化适应能力，包含丰富的特定文化词汇，但同时暴露了重大限制：不同架构间能力差异巨大，部分模型出现逆文化对齐现象，自动指标存在架构偏见且与人类评估相矛盾，视觉-文化理解仍有限

Conclusion: 论文确立了多模态AI文化能力的潜力与挑战，为建设更包容、负责任的多模态AI系统提供了重要的评估基础和见解

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve widespread deployment across diverse
cultural contexts, ensuring their cultural competence becomes critical for
responsible AI systems. While prior work has evaluated cultural awareness in
text-only models and VLM object recognition tasks, no research has
systematically assessed how VLMs adapt outputs when cultural identity cues are
embedded in both textual prompts and visual inputs during generative tasks. We
present the first comprehensive evaluation of VLM cultural competence through
multimodal story generation, developing a novel multimodal framework that
perturbs cultural identity and evaluates 5 contemporary VLMs on a downstream
task: story generation. Our analysis reveals significant cultural adaptation
capabilities, with rich culturally-specific vocabulary spanning names, familial
terms, and geographic markers. However, we uncover concerning limitations:
cultural competence varies dramatically across architectures, some models
exhibit inverse cultural alignment, and automated metrics show architectural
bias contradicting human assessments. Cross-modal evaluation shows that
culturally distinct outputs are indeed detectable through visual-semantic
similarity (28.7% within-nationality vs. 0.2% cross-nationality recall), yet
visual-cultural understanding remains limited. In essence, we establish the
promise and challenges of cultural competence in multimodal AI. We publicly
release our codebase and data: https://github.com/ArkaMukherjee0/mmCultural

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为MH-COPILOT的强化学习框架，用于识别在线心理健康社区帖子中缺失的支持属性，并通过针对性提示帮助用户完善帖子内容，从而提高社区参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线心理健康社区中许多帖子因缺乏关键支持属性而得不到回应，需要一种能够自动识别缺失信息并引导用户补充的方法来提高社区支持效果。

Method: 开发了REDDME数据集（4,760个标注帖子），创建了层次化分类法CueTaxo，并提出了基于强化学习的MH-COPILOT系统，包含属性识别、强度分类、受控问题生成和验证器四个模块。

Result: 在四个大型语言模型上的实验结果显示，该方法在属性引导和用户参与度方面都有显著提升，人工评估进一步验证了其在真实OMHC环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过动态识别缺失的支持属性和生成针对性提示，有效提高了在线心理健康社区帖子的质量和响应率，为改善心理健康支持提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Online Mental Health Communities (OMHCs) provide crucial peer and expert
support, yet many posts remain unanswered due to missing support attributes
that signal the need for help. We present a novel framework that identifies
these gaps and prompts users to enrich their posts, thereby improving
engagement. To support this, we introduce REDDME, a new dataset of 4,760 posts
from mental health subreddits annotated for the span and intensity of three key
support attributes: event what happened?, effect what did the user experience?,
and requirement what support they need?. Next, we devise a hierarchical
taxonomy, CueTaxo, of support attributes for controlled question generation.
Further, we propose MH-COPILOT, a reinforcement learning-based system that
integrates (a) contextual attribute-span identification, (b) support attribute
intensity classification, (c) controlled question generation via a hierarchical
taxonomy, and (d) a verifier for reward modeling. Our model dynamically
assesses posts for the presence/absence of support attributes, and generates
targeted prompts to elicit missing information. Empirical results across four
notable language models demonstrate significant improvements in attribute
elicitation and user engagement. A human evaluation further validates the
model's effectiveness in real-world OMHC settings.

TL;DR: ReProCon是一个新颖的少样本命名实体识别框架，通过多原型建模、余弦对比学习和元学习来解决生物医学领域的数据稀缺和标签不平衡问题，在资源受限环境下达到接近BERT的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学领域的命名实体识别面临数据稀缺和标签分布不平衡的挑战，特别是细粒度实体类型，需要开发能够在有限数据下有效工作的解决方案。

Method: 结合多原型建模（捕捉语义变异性）、余弦对比学习（确保类间分离）和Reptile元学习（快速适应少量数据），使用轻量级的fastText + BiLSTM编码器。

Result: 达到接近BERT基线的macro-F1分数（约99%性能），在30%标签预算下保持稳定，从19类扩展到50类时F1仅下降7.8%，优于SpanProto和CONTaiNER等基线方法。

Conclusion: ReProCon在资源受限环境下表现出最先进的性能，适合生物医学应用，多原型建模和对比学习对处理类别不平衡至关重要。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) in biomedical domains faces challenges due to
data scarcity and imbalanced label distributions, especially with fine-grained
entity types. We propose ReProCon, a novel few-shot NER framework that combines
multi-prototype modeling, cosine-contrastive learning, and Reptile
meta-learning to tackle these issues. By representing each category with
multiple prototypes, ReProCon captures semantic variability, such as synonyms
and contextual differences, while a cosine-contrastive objective ensures strong
interclass separation. Reptile meta-updates enable quick adaptation with little
data. Using a lightweight fastText + BiLSTM encoder with much lower memory
usage, ReProCon achieves a macro-$F_1$ score close to BERT-based baselines
(around 99 percent of BERT performance). The model remains stable with a label
budget of 30 percent and only drops 7.8 percent in $F_1$ when expanding from 19
to 50 categories, outperforming baselines such as SpanProto and CONTaiNER,
which see 10 to 32 percent degradation in Few-NERD. Ablation studies highlight
the importance of multi-prototype modeling and contrastive learning in managing
class imbalance. Despite difficulties with label ambiguity, ReProCon
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in resource-limited settings, making
it suitable for biomedical applications.

### [14] [LLMs Learn Constructions That Humans Do Not Know](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16837)
*Jonathan Dunn,Mai Mohamed Eida*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM会幻觉出人类不认可的错误语法结构，通过行为探测和元语言探测发现模型确实存在构造幻觉，模拟测试显示这些错误假设会被高度确认，表明构造探测方法存在确认偏误问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型是否会产生人类直觉不支持的虚假语法结构构造，探索模型隐含和显式语言知识的差异，以及这些幻觉构造对语言学研究的潜在影响。

Method: 采用行为探测任务（使用上下文嵌入）和元语言探测任务（使用提示），通过模拟假设测试来验证如果语言学家错误假设这些幻觉构造存在会发生什么。

Result: 两种方法都显示模型确实会产生构造幻觉，模拟测试获得的高准确率表明这些错误假设会被强烈确认，揭示了构造探测方法存在确认偏误。

Conclusion: 构造探测方法存在确认偏误问题，这引发了关于模型可能拥有哪些未知且错误的句法知识的担忧，对使用LLM进行语言学研究提出了警示。

Abstract: This paper investigates false positive constructions: grammatical structures
which an LLM hallucinates as distinct constructions but which human
introspection does not support. Both a behavioural probing task using
contextual embeddings and a meta-linguistic probing task using prompts are
included, allowing us to distinguish between implicit and explicit linguistic
knowledge. Both methods reveal that models do indeed hallucinate constructions.
We then simulate hypothesis testing to determine what would have happened if a
linguist had falsely hypothesized that these hallucinated constructions do
exist. The high accuracy obtained shows that such false hypotheses would have
been overwhelmingly confirmed. This suggests that construction probing methods
suffer from a confirmation bias and raises the issue of what unknown and
incorrect syntactic knowledge these models also possess.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结构化、鲁棒的声明验证框架，通过无预设前提的分解问题来解决LLMs的提示敏感性和预设前提问题，在多个数据集和模型上实现了2-5%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明生成问题中的预设前提会引入未经验证的假设，导致声明验证不一致，同时大型语言模型存在显著的提示敏感性（性能差异高达3-6%），尽管近期有所改进但仍是持续性问题。

Method: 提出结构化鲁棒的声明验证框架，通过无预设前提的分解问题进行推理，避免预设前提带来的问题并减少提示敏感性。

Result: 在多个提示、数据集和LLMs上的广泛实验表明，即使最先进的模型仍然容易受到提示变异和预设前提的影响，而该方法能持续缓解这些问题，实现高达2-5%的改进。

Conclusion: 提示敏感性仍然是LLMs的持续挑战，提出的无预设前提分解问题框架能有效提高声明验证的鲁棒性和一致性性能。

Abstract: Prior work has shown that presupposition in generated questions can introduce
unverified assumptions, leading to inconsistencies in claim verification.
Additionally, prompt sensitivity remains a significant challenge for large
language models (LLMs), resulting in performance variance as high as 3-6%.
While recent advancements have reduced this gap, our study demonstrates that
prompt sensitivity remains a persistent issue. To address this, we propose a
structured and robust claim verification framework that reasons through
presupposition-free, decomposed questions. Extensive experiments across
multiple prompts, datasets, and LLMs reveal that even state-of-the-art models
remain susceptible to prompt variance and presupposition. Our method
consistently mitigates these issues, achieving up to a 2-5% improvement.

TL;DR: QR-Distill是一种创新的知识蒸馏方法，通过质量过滤、条件路由和协作同伴教学，有效提升小型模型从大型语言模型中学习推理能力的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在资源受限场景部署困难，传统知识蒸馏方法难以有效捕捉教师模型的全面推理能力，多路径方法中路径质量参差不齐且处理方式单一。

Method: 提出QR-Distill框架：1) 基于LLM评估的质量过滤保留正确推理路径；2) 条件路由根据学生学习状态动态分配路径；3) 协作同伴教学让学生相互蒸馏多样见解。

Result: 实验证明QR-Distill优于传统单路径和多路径蒸馏方法，消融研究验证了质量过滤、条件路由和同伴教学各组件的重要性。

Conclusion: QR-Distill通过综合的质量感知路径选择和协作学习机制，显著提升了知识蒸馏在推理任务上的效果，为资源受限场景下的模型部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) significantly enhance reasoning
capabilities but their deployment is restricted in resource-constrained
scenarios. Knowledge distillation addresses this by transferring knowledge from
powerful teacher models to compact and transparent students. However,
effectively capturing the teacher's comprehensive reasoning is challenging due
to conventional token-level supervision's limited scope. Using multiple
reasoning paths per query alleviates this problem, but treating each path
identically is suboptimal as paths vary widely in quality and suitability
across tasks and models. We propose Quality-filtered Routing with Cooperative
Distillation (QR-Distill), combining path quality filtering, conditional
routing, and cooperative peer teaching. First, quality filtering retains only
correct reasoning paths scored by an LLM-based evaluation. Second, conditional
routing dynamically assigns paths tailored to each student's current learning
state. Finally, cooperative peer teaching enables students to mutually distill
diverse insights, addressing knowledge gaps and biases toward specific
reasoning styles. Experiments demonstrate QR-Distill's superiority over
traditional single- and multi-path distillation methods. Ablation studies
further highlight the importance of each component including quality filtering,
conditional routing, and peer teaching in effective knowledge transfer. Our
code is available at https://github.com/LzyFischer/Distill.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了QFrCoLA（魁北克法语语言可接受性判断语料库），这是一个包含25,153个域内和2,675个域外句子的规范性二元可接受性判断数据集，用于评估语言模型的语言学判断能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型Transformer语言模型在各种下游任务中表现优异，但对其如何内化语言学知识的理解有限，需要跨语言的句法评估基准来促进研究。

Method: 利用QFrCoLA数据集和其他七个语言学二元可接受性判断语料库，对七个语言模型进行基准测试，比较微调Transformer模型和零样本大型语言模型的性能。

Result: 微调Transformer模型在大多数语言中表现强劲，而零样本大型语言模型在该任务上表现较差。对于QFrCoLA基准，微调Transformer模型平均优于其他方法，且预训练跨语言LLM似乎未在预训练中获得魁北克法语的语言判断能力。

Conclusion: QFrCoLA数据集基于语言学规范而非说话者感受构建，与语言可接受性判断相似，是一个具有挑战性的数据集，可用于基准测试语言模型的语言学判断能力。

Abstract: Large and Transformer-based language models perform outstandingly in various
downstream tasks. However, there is limited understanding regarding how these
models internalize linguistic knowledge, so various linguistic benchmarks have
recently been proposed to facilitate syntactic evaluation of language models
across languages. This paper introduces QFrCoLA (Quebec-French Corpus of
Linguistic Acceptability Judgments), a normative binary acceptability judgments
dataset comprising 25,153 in-domain and 2,675 out-of-domain sentences. Our
study leverages the QFrCoLA dataset and seven other linguistic binary
acceptability judgment corpora to benchmark seven language models. The results
demonstrate that, on average, fine-tuned Transformer-based LM are strong
baselines for most languages and that zero-shot binary classification large
language models perform poorly on the task. However, for the QFrCoLA benchmark,
on average, a fine-tuned Transformer-based LM outperformed other methods
tested. It also shows that pre-trained cross-lingual LLMs selected for our
experimentation do not seem to have acquired linguistic judgment capabilities
during their pre-training for Quebec French. Finally, our experiment results on
QFrCoLA show that our dataset, built from examples that illustrate linguistic
norms rather than speakers' feelings, is similar to linguistic acceptability
judgment; it is a challenging dataset that can benchmark LM on their linguistic
judgment capabilities.

TL;DR: FrJUDGE数据集和JUDGEBERT评估指标用于评估法语法律文本简化中的语义保持，JUDGEBERT在相关性测试和合理性检查方面优于现有指标


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律文本简化需要准确保持原意，但在专业法律领域中语义保持的标准与普通文本不同，需要专门的评估工具

Method: 提出了FrJUDGE数据集来评估法律文本间的语义保持，并开发了JUDGEBERT评估指标来专门评估法语法律文本简化中的语义保持质量

Result: JUDGEBERT与人工判断的相关性优于现有指标，通过了两个关键合理性检查：相同句子得100分，无关句子得0分，而其他指标未能通过

Conclusion: JUDGEBERT有潜力改变法律NLP应用，确保法律文本简化对法律从业者和普通用户的准确性和可访问性

Abstract: Simplifying text while preserving its meaning is a complex yet essential
task, especially in sensitive domain applications like legal texts. When
applied to a specialized field, like the legal domain, preservation differs
significantly from its role in regular texts. This paper introduces FrJUDGE, a
new dataset to assess legal meaning preservation between two legal texts. It
also introduces JUDGEBERT, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess legal
meaning preservation in French legal text simplification. JUDGEBERT
demonstrates a superior correlation with human judgment compared to existing
metrics. It also passes two crucial sanity checks, while other metrics did not:
For two identical sentences, it always returns a score of 100%; on the other
hand, it returns 0% for two unrelated sentences. Our findings highlight its
potential to transform legal NLP applications, ensuring accuracy and
accessibility for text simplification for legal practitioners and lay users.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种叫DreamCUB的对话世界模型框架，通过模型化用户情感、情绪和意图来预测未来话语，并给合模型基于强化学习的对话系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然世界模型广泛应用于机器学和自动驾驶领域，但在自然语言任务中的应用还比较有限。需要构建能够预测用户情感、情绪、意图和未来话语的对话世界模型。

Method: 通过定义POMDP，将情感、情绪和意图模型化为用户信念，并通过最大化信息瓶颈来求解。应用模型基于强化学习框架到对话系统，提出DreamCUB框架。

Result: 预训练的对话世界模型在情感分类和情绪识别任务上达到了最先进水平，同时通过策略、评估和对话世界模型的联合训练提升了对话质量。

Conclusion: 该方法在探索-利用平衡方面表现合理，并能够较好地迁移到领域外场景，如共情对话。这为对话世界模型的应用提供了新的视角。

Abstract: World models have been widely utilized in robotics, gaming, and auto-driving.
However, their applications on natural language tasks are relatively limited.
In this paper, we construct the dialogue world model, which could predict the
user's emotion, sentiment, and intention, and future utterances. By defining a
POMDP, we argue emotion, sentiment and intention can be modeled as the user
belief and solved by maximizing the information bottleneck. By this user belief
modeling, we apply the model-based reinforcement learning framework to the
dialogue system, and propose a framework called DreamCUB. Experiments show that
the pretrained dialogue world model can achieve state-of-the-art performances
on emotion classification and sentiment identification, while dialogue quality
is also enhanced by joint training of the policy, critic and dialogue world
model. Further analysis shows that this manner holds a reasonable
exploration-exploitation balance and also transfers well to out-of-domain
scenarios such as empathetic dialogues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM越来越多地被用作其他模型的评判者，但尚不清楚评判者是否能可靠推断对话的潜在目标，特别是在多轮越狱攻击中目标分散在嘈杂、对抗性对话中的情况。

Method: 引入OBJEX(MT)基准测试，要求模型：(i)将对话转录提炼成单句基础目标；(ii)报告自身置信度。使用LLM评判者通过语义相似度评分准确性，使用人工对齐阈值校准正确性，并通过ECE、Brier分数等评估元认知。

Result: claude-sonnet-4获得最高目标提取准确率(0.515)和最佳校准(ECE 0.296；Brier 0.324)，gpt-4.1和Qwen3准确率相同(0.441)但明显过度自信。不同数据集表现差异显著(约0.167-0.865)。

Conclusion: LLM评判者在多轮越狱攻击中经常高置信度地错误推断目标，建议操作指南：尽可能提供明确目标，使用选择性预测或弃权来管理风险。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as judges of other models,
yet it is unclear whether a judge can reliably infer the latent objective of
the conversation it evaluates, especially when the goal is distributed across
noisy, adversarial, multi-turn jailbreaks. We introduce OBJEX(MT), a benchmark
that requires a model to (i) distill a transcript into a single-sentence base
objective and (ii) report its own confidence. Accuracy is scored by an LLM
judge using semantic similarity between extracted and gold objectives;
correctness uses a single human-aligned threshold calibrated once on N=100
items (tau* = 0.61); and metacognition is evaluated with ECE, Brier score,
Wrong@High-Conf, and risk-coverage curves. We evaluate gpt-4.1,
claude-sonnet-4, and Qwen3-235B-A22B-FP8 on SafeMT Attack_600, SafeMTData_1K,
MHJ, and CoSafe. claude-sonnet-4 attains the highest objective-extraction
accuracy (0.515) and the best calibration (ECE 0.296; Brier 0.324), while
gpt-4.1 and Qwen3 tie at 0.441 accuracy yet show marked overconfidence (mean
confidence approx. 0.88 vs. accuracy approx. 0.44; Wrong@0.90 approx. 48-52%).
Performance varies sharply across datasets (approx. 0.167-0.865), with MHJ
comparatively easy and Attack_600/CoSafe harder. These results indicate that
LLM judges often misinfer objectives with high confidence in multi-turn
jailbreaks and suggest operational guidance: provide judges with explicit
objectives when possible and use selective prediction or abstention to manage
risk. We release prompts, scoring templates, and complete logs to facilitate
replication and analysis.

Method: 使用条件前门调整方法，构建反事实外部知识来模拟查询在不同上下文中的行为，解决查询固定无法直接因果干预的挑战

Result: 在多个LLMs和基准数据集上的实验表明，CFD-Prompting在准确性和鲁棒性上显著优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: 条件前门提示框架在较弱假设下运行，增强了推理过程的鲁棒性和泛化能力，有效解决了LLMs的内部偏见问题

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in natural
language processing but still struggle to perform well on knowledge-intensive
tasks that require deep reasoning and the integration of external knowledge.
Although methods such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have been proposed to enhance LLMs with external
knowledge, they still suffer from internal bias in LLMs, which often leads to
incorrect answers. In this paper, we propose a novel causal prompting
framework, Conditional Front-Door Prompting (CFD-Prompting), which enables the
unbiased estimation of the causal effect between the query and the answer,
conditional on external knowledge, while mitigating internal bias. By
constructing counterfactual external knowledge, our framework simulates how the
query behaves under varying contexts, addressing the challenge that the query
is fixed and is not amenable to direct causal intervention. Compared to the
standard front-door adjustment, the conditional variant operates under weaker
assumptions, enhancing both robustness and generalisability of the reasoning
process. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmark datasets
demonstrate that CFD-Prompting significantly outperforms existing baselines in
both accuracy and robustness.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在情感敏感交互中被广泛使用，其模拟的共情能力可能造成虚假关系连接的幻觉，存在心理安全风险。

Method: 提出了AHaBench基准（500个心理健康相关提示）和AHaPairs偏好数据集（5K实例），采用直接偏好优化（DPO）进行情感责任对齐。

Result: 实验表明DPO微调显著减少情感幻觉，同时不损害核心推理和知识性能，人类-模型一致性分析验证了AHaBench的有效性。

Conclusion: 确立了情感幻觉作为独立的安全问题，为开发既事实可靠又心理安全的LLM提供了实用资源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in emotionally sensitive
interactions, where their simulated empathy can create the illusion of genuine
relational connection. We define this risk as Affective Hallucination, the
production of emotionally immersive responses that foster illusory social
presence despite the model's lack of affective capacity. To systematically
diagnose and mitigate this risk, we introduce AHaBench, a benchmark of 500
mental health-related prompts with expert-informed reference responses,
evaluated along three dimensions: Emotional Enmeshment, Illusion of Presence,
and Fostering Overdependence. We further release AHaPairs, a 5K-instance
preference dataset enabling Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for alignment
with emotionally responsible behavior. Experiments across multiple model
families show that DPO fine-tuning substantially reduces affective
hallucination without degrading core reasoning and knowledge performance.
Human-model agreement analyses confirm that AHaBench reliably captures
affective hallucination, validating it as an effective diagnostic tool. This
work establishes affective hallucination as a distinct safety concern and
provides practical resources for developing LLMs that are not only factually
reliable but also psychologically safe. AHaBench and AHaPairs are accessible
via https://huggingface.co/datasets/o0oMiNGo0o/AHaBench, and code for
fine-tuning and evaluation are in https://github.com/0oOMiNGOo0/AHaBench.
Warning: This paper contains examples of mental health-related language that

Motivation: 预训练语言模型虽然具备强大推理能力，但其黑盒特性带来的可信度问题日益凸显，需要探究模型是否真正理解文本隐含知识而非仅关注表面内容。

Method: 提出KnowProb知识引导探测方法，从文本底层内容推导六种潜在解释（3种基于知识的理解和3种基于关联的推理），以多角度探测黑盒模型。

Result: 验证发现当前PLMs仅学习单一表征分布，在捕捉文本隐藏知识方面仍面临重大挑战；证明该方法能有效识别现有黑盒模型的局限性。

Conclusion: KnowProb方法有助于从多角度探测黑盒模型的限制，推动可解释性检测研究的发展。

Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) are trained on large amounts of unlabeled
data, yet they exhibit remarkable reasoning skills. However, the
trustworthiness challenges posed by these black-box models have become
increasingly evident in recent years. To alleviate this problem, this paper
proposes a novel Knowledge-guided Probing approach called KnowProb in a
post-hoc explanation way, which aims to probe whether black-box PLMs understand
implicit knowledge beyond the given text, rather than focusing only on the
surface level content of the text. We provide six potential explanations
derived from the underlying content of the given text, including three
knowledge-based understanding and three association-based reasoning. In
experiments, we validate that current small-scale (or large-scale) PLMs only
learn a single distribution of representation, and still face significant
challenges in capturing the hidden knowledge behind a given text. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective for identifying the
limitations of existing black-box models from multiple probing perspectives,
which facilitates researchers to promote the study of detecting black-box
models in an explainable way.

Method: 研究对开放的公开文档进行审计调查，涵盖5家领先组织的6个LLM开发项目（包括GPT、Claude、Gemini、Llama、Gemma和Qwen），重点关注价值设定和数据中心视角。

Result: 研究详细记录了每个项目的发现，并从价值设定和数据角度提供了总体总结，揭示了当前对齐实践的具体情况和存在的问题。

Conclusion: 论文基于研究发现讨论了一系列更广泛的相关问题，指出当前AI对齐方法在价值范围和数据基础方面的不足，为进一步改进对齐实践提供了见解。

Abstract: AI Alignment, primarily in the form of Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF), has been a cornerstone of the post-training phase in
developing Large Language Models (LLMs). It has also been a popular research
topic across various disciplines beyond Computer Science, including Philosophy
and Law, among others, highlighting the socio-technical challenges involved.
Nonetheless, except for the computational techniques related to alignment,
there has been limited focus on the broader picture: the scope of these
processes, which primarily rely on the selected objectives (values), and the
data collected and used to imprint such objectives into the models. This work
aims to reveal how alignment is understood and applied in practice from a
value-setting and data-centric perspective. For this purpose, we investigate
and survey (`audit') publicly available documentation released by 6 LLM
development initiatives by 5 leading organizations shaping this technology,
focusing on proprietary (OpenAI's GPT, Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini) and
open-weight (Meta's Llama, Google's Gemma, and Alibaba's Qwen) initiatives, all
published in the last 3 years. The findings are documented in detail per
initiative, while there is also an overall summary concerning different
aspects, mainly from a value-setting and data-centric perspective. On the basis
of our findings, we discuss a series of broader related concerns.

Conclusion: ReFactX提供了一种可扩展的LLM外部知识访问方案，无需复杂检索管道，实现了高效可靠的知识获取

Abstract: Knowledge gaps and hallucinations are persistent challenges for Large
Language Models (LLMs), which generate unreliable responses when lacking the
necessary information to fulfill user instructions. Existing approaches, such
as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool use, aim to address these
issues by incorporating external knowledge. Yet, they rely on additional models
or services, resulting in complex pipelines, potential error propagation, and
often requiring the model to process a large number of tokens. In this paper,
we present a scalable method that enables LLMs to access external knowledge
without depending on retrievers or auxiliary models. Our approach uses
constrained generation with a pre-built prefix-tree index. Triples from a
Knowledge Graph are verbalized in textual facts, tokenized, and indexed in a
prefix tree for efficient access. During inference, to acquire external
knowledge, the LLM generates facts with constrained generation which allows
only sequences of tokens that form an existing fact. We evaluate our proposal
on Question Answering and show that it scales to large knowledge bases (800
million facts), adapts to domain-specific data, and achieves effective results.
These gains come with minimal generation-time overhead. ReFactX code is

Motivation: 现有的RAG评估方法忽视了真实场景中的结构复杂性和多步推理需求，以及检索难度与推理深度之间的交互关系

Method: 构建合成多跳QA数据集，通过知识图谱提取和语义聚类增强来生成难度可控的查询，建立结合生成端和检索端难度的2D难度矩阵

Result: 跨多个领域和模型的实验显示错误率与难度度量强相关，验证了其诊断效用

Conclusion: GRADE框架能够对RAG性能进行细粒度分析，为评估和改进真实应用中的多跳推理提供了可扩展的基础

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are widely adopted in
knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, but current evaluations often overlook the
structural complexity and multi-step reasoning required in real-world
scenarios. These benchmarks overlook key factors such as the interaction
between retrieval difficulty and reasoning depth. To address this gap, we
propose \textsc{GRADE}, a novel evaluation framework that models task
difficulty along two orthogonal dimensions: (1) reasoning depth, defined by the
number of inference steps (hops), and (2) semantic distance between the query
and its supporting evidence. We construct a synthetic multi-hop QA dataset from

*Abdelrahman Abdallah,Jamshid Mozafari,Bhawna Piryani,Adam Jatowt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeAR是一个开源的文档重排序框架，通过双阶段方法将细粒度相关性评分与整体文档分析解耦，在多个基准测试中超越了开源基线模型和GPT-4。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文档重排序中虽然能够进行全局推理，但单一模型往往难以平衡细粒度相关性评分和跨文档整体分析的需求。

Method: 采用双阶段方法：第一阶段使用冻结的13B LLaMA教师模型通过交叉熵、RankNet和KL散度损失将token级相关性信号蒸馏到紧凑的{3,8}B学生模型；第二阶段附加第二个LoRA适配器，在20K GPT-4o生成的思维链排列上进行微调，实现带自然语言解释的列表推理。

Result: 在TREC-DL19/20、8个BEIR数据集和NovelEval-2306上表现优异，在DL20上比开源基线提升+5.1 nDCG@5，在NovelEval上达到90.97 nDCG@10，超越GPT-4 +3.09。在开放域QA任务中达到54.29 Top-1准确率。

Conclusion: DeAR通过双损失蒸馏确保稳定校准，为现代重排序系统提供了高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed listwise document reranking by
enabling global reasoning over candidate sets, yet single models often struggle
to balance fine-grained relevance scoring with holistic cross-document
analysis. We propose \textbf{De}ep\textbf{A}gent\textbf{R}ank (\textbf{\DeAR}),
an open-source framework that decouples these tasks through a dual-stage
approach, achieving superior accuracy and interpretability. In \emph{Stage 1},
we distill token-level relevance signals from a frozen 13B LLaMA teacher into a
compact \{3, 8\}B student model using a hybrid of cross-entropy, RankNet, and
KL divergence losses, ensuring robust pointwise scoring. In \emph{Stage 2}, we
attach a second LoRA adapter and fine-tune on 20K GPT-4o-generated
chain-of-thought permutations, enabling listwise reasoning with
natural-language justifications. Evaluated on TREC-DL19/20, eight BEIR
datasets, and NovelEval-2306, \DeAR surpasses open-source baselines by +5.1
nDCG@5 on DL20 and achieves 90.97 nDCG@10 on NovelEval, outperforming GPT-4 by
+3.09. Without fine-tuning on Wikipedia, DeAR also excels in open-domain QA,
achieving 54.29 Top-1 accuracy on Natural Questions, surpassing baselines like
MonoT5, UPR, and RankGPT. Ablations confirm that dual-loss distillation ensures
stable calibration, making \DeAR a highly effective and interpretable solution
for modern reranking systems.\footnote{Dataset and code available at

*Jason R Brown,Lennie Wells,Edward James Young,Sergio Bacallado*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了KL正则化Q学习(KLQ)方法，用于语言模型的人类反馈强化学习(LM-RLHF)，该方法在理论上与PPO等价但在实践中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPO算法虽然经验上有效，但其启发式动机和对KL散度约束的临时处理方式存在理论不足，需要开发更理论严谨的方法。

Method: 开发了KL正则化Q学习(KLQ)方法，这是一种新的动作价值RL方法，专门针对LM-RLHF设置设计。

Result: KLQ在优化LM-RLHF目标上与PPO表现相当，在LLM作为评判者的评估中 consistently 获得更高的胜率。

Conclusion: KLQ提供了PPO的理论等价替代方案，在保持相同性能的同时具有更坚实的理论基础，在语言生成任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) is an established and effective policy
gradient algorithm used for Language Model Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (LM-RLHF). PPO performs well empirically but has a heuristic
motivation and handles the KL-divergence constraint used in LM-RLHF in an
ad-hoc manner. In this paper, we develop a a new action-value RL method for the
LM-RLHF setting, KL-regularised Q-Learning (KLQ). We then show that our method
is equivalent to a version of PPO in a certain specific sense, despite its very
different motivation. Finally, we benchmark KLQ on two key language generation
tasks -- summarisation and single-turn dialogue. We demonstrate that KLQ
performs on-par with PPO at optimising the LM-RLHF objective, and achieves a
consistently higher win-rate against PPO on LLM-as-a-judge evaluations.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的基于思维链和问题分解的方法在表格理解任务中缺乏显式的长期规划和弱的步骤间连接，导致问题约束被忽略。本文旨在利用大语言模型的长期规划能力来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出利用大语言模型的长期规划能力来执行紧密连接的步骤计划，这些步骤服务于最终目标，同时有效减少在解决短期目标过程中包含不必要细节的问题。

Result: 在WikiTableQuestions和TabFact数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法优于强基线方法，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过利用大语言模型的长期规划能力，本文提出的方法在表格理解任务中取得了显著改进，解决了现有方法的局限性，并在基准数据集上实现了最优性能。

Abstract: Table understanding is key to addressing challenging downstream tasks such as
table-based question answering and fact verification. Recent works have focused
on leveraging Chain-of-Thought and question decomposition to solve complex
questions requiring multiple operations on tables. However, these methods often
suffer from a lack of explicit long-term planning and weak inter-step
connections, leading to miss constraints within questions. In this paper, we
propose leveraging the long-term planning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) to enhance table understanding. Our approach enables the execution of a
long-term plan, where the steps are tightly interconnected and serve the
ultimate goal, an aspect that methods based on Chain-of-Thought and question
decomposition lack. In addition, our method effectively minimizes the inclusion
of unnecessary details in the process of solving the next short-term goals, a
limitation of methods based on Chain-of-Thought. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on WikiTableQuestions and TabFact datasets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了EduRABSA数据集和ASQE-DPT标注工具，解决了教育领域评论文本缺乏高质量标注数据的问题，支持细粒度的方面级情感分析任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教育机构每年收集大量学生文本反馈，但由于内容复杂性和细粒度报告需求，自动意见挖掘面临挑战。现有ABSA研究主要集中在商业领域，教育领域缺乏公开标注数据集。

Method: 创建了首个公开的英语教育评论ABSA数据集EduRABSA，涵盖课程、教师和大学三个主题类型，支持所有主要ABSA任务，包括隐含方面和隐含意见提取。同时开发了ASQE-DPT离线标注工具，可从单任务标注生成全面的ABSA标注数据集。

Result: 提供了高质量的教育评论标注数据集，包含三个评论文本主题类型，支持完整的ABSA任务链。标注工具简化了数据标注流程，提高了研究透明度和可重复性。

Conclusion: EduRABSA数据集和ASQE-DPT工具消除了教育领域ABSA研究的数据障碍，为教育意见挖掘研究提供了重要资源，支持进一步的研究和资源创建共享。

Abstract: Every year, most educational institutions seek and receive an enormous volume
of text feedback from students on courses, teaching, and overall experience.
Yet, turning this raw feedback into useful insights is far from
straightforward. It has been a long-standing challenge to adopt automatic
opinion mining solutions for such education review text data due to the content
complexity and low-granularity reporting requirements. Aspect-based Sentiment
Analysis (ABSA) offers a promising solution with its rich, sub-sentence-level
opinion mining capabilities. However, existing ABSA research and resources are
very heavily focused on the commercial domain. In education, they are scarce
and hard to develop due to limited public datasets and strict data protection.
A high-quality, annotated dataset is urgently needed to advance research in
this under-resourced area. In this work, we present EduRABSA (Education Review
ABSA), the first public, annotated ABSA education review dataset that covers
three review subject types (course, teaching staff, university) in the English
language and all main ABSA tasks, including the under-explored implicit aspect
and implicit opinion extraction. We also share ASQE-DPT (Data Processing Tool),
an offline, lightweight, installation-free manual data annotation tool that
generates labelled datasets for comprehensive ABSA tasks from a single-task
annotation. Together, these resources contribute to the ABSA community and
education domain by removing the dataset barrier, supporting research
transparency and reproducibility, and enabling the creation and sharing of
further resources. The dataset, annotation tool, and scripts and statistics for
dataset processing and sampling are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理表格内容不可预测性方面存在困难，过度依赖预处理和关键词匹配，且缺乏上下文信息，导致大语言模型推理过程复杂。

Method: 引入面向实体的搜索方法，利用语义相似性和单元格间隐式关系；首创使用图查询语言进行表格理解；确保表格单元格语义紧密绑定以增强上下文清晰度。

Result: 在WikiTableQuestions和TabFact标准基准测试中取得了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了表格理解的挑战，减少了对预处理和关键词匹配的依赖，通过语义绑定和图查询语言建立了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Our work addresses the challenges of understanding tables. Existing methods
often struggle with the unpredictable nature of table content, leading to a
reliance on preprocessing and keyword matching. They also face limitations due
to the lack of contextual information, which complicates the reasoning
processes of large language models (LLMs). To overcome these challenges, we
introduce an entity-oriented search method to improve table understanding with
LLMs. This approach effectively leverages the semantic similarities between
questions and table data, as well as the implicit relationships between table
cells, minimizing the need for data preprocessing and keyword matching.
Additionally, it focuses on table entities, ensuring that table cells are
semantically tightly bound, thereby enhancing contextual clarity. Furthermore,
we pioneer the use of a graph query language for table understanding,
establishing a new research direction. Experiments show that our approach
achieves new state-of-the-art performances on standard benchmarks

Motivation: 解决有害文本分类中数据稀缺问题，特别是在护栏应用场景中需要大量标注数据来训练有效的分类模型。

Method: 两阶段方法：1）使用约束LLM生成几何控制的示例；2）通过多智能体反射过程进行增强，促进风格多样性并发现边缘案例。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上验证，使用GRAID增强的有害文本分类数据集显著提高了下游护栏模型的性能。

Conclusion: GRAID管道能够可靠地覆盖输入空间并进行细致的有害内容探索，为解决数据稀缺问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We address the problem of data scarcity in harmful text classification for
guardrailing applications and introduce GRAID (Geometric and Reflective
AI-Driven Data Augmentation), a novel pipeline that leverages Large Language
Models (LLMs) for dataset augmentation. GRAID consists of two stages: (i)
generation of geometrically controlled examples using a constrained LLM, and
(ii) augmentation through a multi-agentic reflective process that promotes
stylistic diversity and uncovers edge cases. This combination enables both
reliable coverage of the input space and nuanced exploration of harmful
content. Using two benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that augmenting a
harmful text classification dataset with GRAID leads to significant
improvements in downstream guardrail model performance.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在低资源语言上性能提升面临挑战，需要无需昂贵微调的数据高效方法

Method: 从语言桥梁角度出发，构建基于MUSE双语词典的神经元探测数据，定义语言重叠神经元子集，提出基于HSIC的指标量化语言谱系并指导桥梁选择

Result: 在2个跨语言任务和15个语言对上的实验验证了方法的有效性，为LLMs的多语言机制提供了实证见解

Conclusion: BridgeX-ICL通过探索共享神经元机制，有效提升了低资源语言的跨语言性能，为多语言模型优化提供了新思路

Abstract: The current Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in
improving performance on low-resource languages and urgently need
data-efficient methods without costly fine-tuning. From the perspective of
language-bridge, we propose BridgeX-ICL, a simple yet effective method to
improve zero-shot Cross-lingual In-Context Learning (X-ICL) for low-resource
languages. Unlike existing works focusing on language-specific neurons,
BridgeX-ICL explores whether sharing neurons can improve cross-lingual
performance in LLMs or not. We construct neuron probe data from the
ground-truth MUSE bilingual dictionaries, and define a subset of language
overlap neurons accordingly, to ensure full activation of these anchored
neurons. Subsequently, we propose an HSIC-based metric to quantify LLMs'
internal linguistic spectrum based on overlap neurons, which guides optimal
bridge selection. The experiments conducted on 2 cross-lingual tasks and 15
language pairs from 7 diverse families (covering both high-low and moderate-low
pairs) validate the effectiveness of BridgeX-ICL and offer empirical insights
into the underlying multilingual mechanisms of LLMs.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型中标记表征的同质化现象，以及位置偏置如何增强这种效应，了解模型内部处理机制的特性。

Method: 通过层间相似性分析和控制实验，系统性地检查标记在处理过程中失去特异性的现象，尤其在偏向极端位置时的情况。

Result: 证实了标记同质化现象的存在，以及这种现象对位置注意机制的依赖性，标记在处理过程中系统性地失去特异性。

Conclusion: 证明了Transformer模型中存在标记同质化现象，且这种现象与位置注意机制密切相关，位置偏置会增强标记表征的均匀化趋势。

Abstract: This paper investigates token homogenization - the convergence of token
representations toward uniformity across transformer layers and its
relationship to positional bias in large language models. We empirically
examine whether homogenization occurs and how positional bias amplifies this
effect. Through layer-wise similarity analysis and controlled experiments, we
demonstrate that tokens systematically lose distinctiveness during processing,
particularly when biased toward extremal positions. Our findings confirm both
the existence of homogenization and its dependence on positional attention
mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在权衡：transformer注意力能识别文本连接但缺乏语义标签，NLI模型能分类句子关系但缺乏上下文显著性

Method: 流水线方法：先通过聚合token级注意力分数识别与目标句子相关的候选句子，再用预训练NLI模型将每个候选分类为前提（蕴含）或矛盾，最后用注意力显著性分数过滤NLI识别的关系

Result: 能有效隔离文本中任何给定主张的最重要语义关系

Conclusion: 该方法结合了两种方法的优势，为目标分析提供了高效的解决方案

Abstract: Finding the relationships between sentences in a document is crucial for
tasks like fact-checking, argument mining, and text summarization. A key
challenge is to identify which sentences act as premises or contradictions for
a specific claim. Existing methods often face a trade-off: transformer
attention mechanisms can identify salient textual connections but lack explicit
semantic labels, while Natural Language Inference (NLI) models can classify
relationships between sentence pairs but operate independently of contextual
saliency. In this work, we introduce a method that combines the strengths of
both approaches for a targeted analysis. Our pipeline first identifies
candidate sentences that are contextually relevant to a user-selected target
sentence by aggregating token-level attention scores. It then uses a pretrained
NLI model to classify each candidate as a premise (entailment) or
contradiction. By filtering NLI-identified relationships with attention-based
saliency scores, our method efficiently isolates the most significant semantic
relationships for any given claim in a text.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 搜索引擎在信息获取中扮演核心角色，但标题框架等微妙线索不仅影响用户信念，还可能影响搜索行为。虽然框架效应对判断的影响已有充分研究，但其对后续搜索行为的影响尚不明确

Method: 进行了一项受控实验，参与者根据特定语言框架过滤的标题发出查询并进行选择

Result: 标题框架显著影响后续查询：冲突和策略框架破坏了与先前选择的一致性，情景框架比主题框架产生更具体的查询。观察到适度的短期框架持续性，但随时间减弱

Conclusion: 即使短暂接触框架信息，也能显著改变用户信息寻求行为的方向，这对搜索引擎设计和信息传播具有重要意义

Abstract: Search engines play a central role in how people gather information, but
subtle cues like headline framing may influence not only what users believe but
also how they search. While framing effects on judgment are well documented,
their impact on subsequent search behavior is less understood. We conducted a
controlled experiment where participants issued queries and selected from
headlines filtered by specific linguistic frames. Headline framing
significantly shaped follow-up queries: conflict and strategy frames disrupted
alignment with prior selections, while episodic frames led to more concrete
queries than thematic ones. We also observed modest short-term frame
persistence that declined over time. These results suggest that even brief
exposure to framing can meaningfully alter the direction of users
information-seeking behavior.

Motivation: 现有自盛学习语言识别模型在将同一语言的不同方言和口音统一分类时遇到困难，需要更好地处理语言内部的变体。

Method: 提出地理位置感知语言识别方法，将语言级地理位置信息注入SSL模型。通过地理位置预测辅助任务，并将预测向量注入中间表征作为条件信号。

Result: 在6个多语言数据集上验证，方法提升了对语言内变体和未见域的稳健性，在FLEURS数据集达到新的SOTA准确率97.7%，在ML-SUPERB 2.0方言集上相对提升9.7%。

Conclusion: 地理位置感知的显式条件化能够促进模型学习更统一的表征，有效提升了语言识别模型在方言和口音处理方面的性能。

Abstract: While Self-supervised Learning (SSL) has significantly improved Spoken
Language Identification (LID), existing models often struggle to consistently
classify dialects and accents of the same language as a unified class. To
address this challenge, we propose geolocation-aware LID, a novel approach that
incorporates language-level geolocation information into the SSL-based LID
model. Specifically, we introduce geolocation prediction as an auxiliary task
and inject the predicted vectors into intermediate representations as
conditioning signals. This explicit conditioning encourages the model to learn
more unified representations for dialectal and accented variations. Experiments
across six multilingual datasets demonstrate that our approach improves
robustness to intra-language variations and unseen domains, achieving new
state-of-the-art accuracy on FLEURS (97.7%) and 9.7% relative improvement on

Motivation: 现有的研究虽然探索了自然语言可满足性问题，但没有充分讨论不同语言片段对应的计算复杂度类别如何影响TLMs的学习能力。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过实证研究分析可满足性问题的分布特征，评估TLMs在不同复杂度类别和语法结构下的推理规则学习能力。

Result: 研究发现不同计算复杂度类别和语法构造确实会影响TLMs学习推理规则的效果，为模型评估提供了更全面的视角。

Conclusion: 在评估TLMs的自然语言推理能力时，必须考虑问题实例的计算复杂度类别和语言特征，这对未来研究具有重要指导意义。

Abstract: Efforts to apply transformer-based language models (TLMs) to the problem of
reasoning in natural language have enjoyed ever-increasing success in recent
years. The most fundamental task in this area to which nearly all others can be
reduced is that of determining satisfiability. However, from a logical point of
view, satisfiability problems vary along various dimensions, which may affect
TLMs' ability to learn how to solve them. The problem instances of
satisfiability in natural language can belong to different computational
complexity classes depending on the language fragment in which they are
expressed. Although prior research has explored the problem of natural language
satisfiability, the above-mentioned point has not been discussed adequately.
Hence, we investigate how problem instances from varying computational
complexity classes and having different grammatical constructs impact TLMs'
ability to learn rules of inference. Furthermore, to faithfully evaluate TLMs,
we conduct an empirical study to explore the distribution of satisfiability
problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模多语言评估结果存在混杂和分散的问题，被目标语言、实验设置和模型选择等因素所干扰，尤其在低资源语言的评估中面临挑战。

Method: 提出一种框架来解析这些混杂变量，并引入三个可解释的指标：性能实现比、其变异系数和语言潜力。通过对13个模型变体在11个多语言数据集上的案例研究进行验证。

Result: 该框架能够提供更可靠的模型性能和语言差异测量，尤其在低资源语言方面表现突出。重要发现是：更高的整体模型性能并不一定意味着越大的语言公平性。

Conclusion: 该研究为多语言评估提供了更精细和可解释的分析工具，帮助更好地理解模型在不同语言上的表现差异，并提醒研究者不要简单地将整体性能作为语言公平性的代理指标。

Abstract: Results reported in large-scale multilingual evaluations are often fragmented
and confounded by factors such as target languages, differences in experimental
setups, and model choices. We propose a framework that disentangles these
confounding variables and introduces three interpretable metrics--the
performance realisation ratio, its coefficient of variation, and language
potential--enabling a finer-grained and more insightful quantification of
actual performance disparities across both (i) models and (ii) languages.
Through a case study of 13 model variants on 11 multilingual datasets, we
demonstrate that our framework provides a more reliable measurement of model
performance and language disparities, particularly for low-resource languages,
which have so far proven challenging to evaluate. Importantly, our results
reveal that higher overall model performance does not necessarily imply greater
fairness across languages.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在数据视角主义框架下进行主观内容标注的能力，特别是考虑不同标注者角色时的表现。

Method: 使用LLMs生成标注，评估其与现有标注者建模技术的对比，分析LLMs如何选择性使用人口统计属性，并识别典型标注者特征。

Result: LLMs在弱数据视角主义下表现优于强数据视角主义和人类标注，但在强视角主义个性化数据集上表现接近但未超越人类。LLMs倾向于聚合观点而非保持主观性。

Conclusion: LLMs在数据视角主义标注任务中表现出选择性使用角色特征的能力，在弱视角主义下具有优势，但在需要强主观性的任务中仍无法完全替代人类标注者。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
annotate hate speech and abusiveness while considering predefined annotator
personas within the strong-to-weak data perspectivism spectra. We evaluated
LLM-generated annotations against existing annotator modeling techniques for
perspective modeling. Our findings show that LLMs selectively use demographic
attributes from the personas. We identified prototypical annotators, with
persona features that show varying degrees of alignment with the original human
annotators. Within the data perspectivism paradigm, annotator modeling
techniques that do not explicitly rely on annotator information performed
better under weak data perspectivism compared to both strong data perspectivism
and human annotations, suggesting LLM-generated views tend towards aggregation
despite subjective prompting. However, for more personalized datasets tailored
to strong perspectivism, the performance of LLM annotator modeling approached,
but did not exceed, human annotators.

Abstract: Instruction tuning is a pivotal technique for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human intentions, safety constraints, and domain-specific
requirements. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the full
pipeline, encompassing (i) data collection methodologies, (ii) full-parameter
and parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies, and (iii) evaluation protocols.
We categorized data construction into three major paradigms: expert annotation,
distillation from larger models, and self-improvement mechanisms, each offering
distinct trade-offs between quality, scalability, and resource cost.
Fine-tuning techniques range from conventional supervised training to
lightweight approaches, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and prefix tuning,
with a focus on computational efficiency and model reusability. We further
examine the challenges of evaluating faithfulness, utility, and safety across
multilingual and multimodal scenarios, highlighting the emergence of
domain-specific benchmarks in healthcare, legal, and financial applications.
Finally, we discuss promising directions for automated data generation,
adaptive optimization, and robust evaluation frameworks, arguing that a closer
integration of data, algorithms, and human feedback is essential for advancing
instruction-tuned LLMs. This survey aims to serve as a practical reference for
researchers and practitioners seeking to design LLMs that are both effective
and reliably aligned with human intentions.

TL;DR: 提出了PU-ADKA框架，通过预算约束下的专家主动咨询来增强专业领域LLM的知识，在药物发现等专业领域表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在高度专业化和成本敏感的领域（如药物发现和罕见疾病研究）中缺乏专家知识，需要有效的方法在有限预算内增强领域专业知识

Method: PU-ADKA框架选择性识别并咨询最合适的专家，考虑专家的可用性、知识边界和咨询成本，使用PubMed数据进行模拟训练

Result: 通过受控专家交互和真实药物开发团队部署验证了有效性，在严格预算约束下显著提升了LLM在专业领域的性能

Conclusion: 该方法为成本敏感的领域知识获取提供了有效解决方案，并引入了新的基准数据集CKAD以促进该领域进一步研究

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated an impressive level of general
knowledge. However, they often struggle in highly specialized and
cost-sensitive domains such as drug discovery and rare disease research due to
the lack of expert knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
(PU-ADKA) designed to efficiently enhance domain-specific LLMs by actively
engaging domain experts within a fixed budget. Unlike traditional fine-tuning
approaches, PU-ADKA selectively identifies and queries the most appropriate
expert from a team, taking into account each expert's availability, knowledge
boundaries, and consultation costs. We train PU-ADKA using simulations on
PubMed data and validate it through both controlled expert interactions and
real-world deployment with a drug development team, demonstrating its
effectiveness in enhancing LLM performance in specialized domains under strict
budget constraints. In addition to outlining our methodological innovations and
experimental results, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, CKAD, for
cost-effective LLM domain knowledge acquisition to foster further research in
this challenging area.

Result: 在多个上下文问答数据集上达到最佳准确性，显示出强大的横向迁移能力，提升跨语言准确性保持一般指令遵循能力

Conclusion: SSFO为RAG忧实性提升提供了一种高效自盛学习方案，无需外部标注且保持了模型的一般性能

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems require Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate responses that are faithful to the retrieved context.
However, faithfulness hallucination remains a critical challenge, as existing
methods often require costly supervision and post-training or significant
inference burdens. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Self-Supervised
Faithfulness Optimization (SSFO), the first self-supervised alignment approach
for enhancing RAG faithfulness. SSFO constructs preference data pairs by
contrasting the model's outputs generated with and without the context.
Leveraging Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), SSFO aligns model faithfulness
without incurring labeling costs or additional inference burden. We
theoretically and empirically demonstrate that SSFO leverages a benign form of
\emph{likelihood displacement}, transferring probability mass from
parametric-based tokens to context-aligned tokens. Based on this insight, we
propose a modified DPO loss function to encourage likelihood displacement.
Comprehensive evaluations show that SSFO significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art faithfulness on multiple context-based
question-answering datasets. Notably, SSFO exhibits strong generalization,
improving cross-lingual faithfulness and preserving general
instruction-following capabilities. We release our code and model at the

Conclusion: 法律要求生成是一个重要但挑战性的任务，本研究为该领域的进一步探索奠定了基础，并将公开数据集以促进研究。

Abstract: Legal claims refer to the plaintiff's demands in a case and are essential to
guiding judicial reasoning and case resolution. While many works have focused
on improving the efficiency of legal professionals, the research on helping
non-professionals (e.g., plaintiffs) remains unexplored. This paper explores
the problem of legal claim generation based on the given case's facts. First,
we construct ClaimGen-CN, the first dataset for Chinese legal claim generation
task, from various real-world legal disputes. Additionally, we design an
evaluation metric tailored for assessing the generated claims, which
encompasses two essential dimensions: factuality and clarity. Building on this,
we conduct a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art general and
legal-domain large language models. Our findings highlight the limitations of
the current models in factual precision and expressive clarity, pointing to the
need for more targeted development in this domain. To encourage further
exploration of this important task, we will make the dataset publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RouteDK是一个通过LoRA专家混合架构路由蒸馏知识的框架，解决了LLM在自动捆绑生成中计算成本高和知识冲突的问题，实现了与教师模型相当甚至更好的性能，同时保持计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在自动捆绑生成中表现出潜力但计算成本过高。知识蒸馏虽然可以提供更高效的学生模型，但初步研究发现直接将不同类型的蒸馏知识整合到学生模型中会导致知识冲突，影响捆绑生成性能。

Method: 提出RouteDK框架：1）从教师LLM中蒸馏两种互补知识（高层通用规则和细粒度会话特定推理）；2）为每种知识训练专门的LoRA专家和基础LoRA专家；3）设计动态融合模块，通过输入感知路由器动态确定最优权重；4）设计推理时增强模块减少方差和次优推理。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，RouteDK达到了与教师LLM相当甚至更好的准确率，同时保持了强大的计算效率，并且在捆绑生成任务上优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: RouteDK通过有效的知识路由和融合机制，成功解决了知识冲突问题，实现了高效且高性能的捆绑生成，为LLM的知识蒸馏应用提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in automatic bundle
generation but suffer from prohibitive computational costs. Although knowledge
distillation offers a pathway to more efficient student models, our preliminary
study reveals that naively integrating diverse types of distilled knowledge
from teacher LLMs into student LLMs leads to knowledge conflict, negatively
impacting the performance of bundle generation. To address this, we propose
RouteDK, a framework for routing distilled knowledge through a mixture of LoRA
expert architecture. Specifically, we first distill knowledge from the teacher
LLM for bundle generation in two complementary types: high-level knowledge
(generalizable rules) and fine-grained knowledge (session-specific reasoning).
We then train knowledge-specific LoRA experts for each type of knowledge
together with a base LoRA expert. For effective integration, we propose a
dynamic fusion module, featuring an input-aware router, where the router
balances expert contributions by dynamically determining optimal weights based
on input, thereby effectively mitigating knowledge conflicts. To further
improve inference reliability, we design an inference-time enhancement module
to reduce variance and mitigate suboptimal reasoning. Experiments on three
public datasets show that our RouteDK achieves accuracy comparable to or even
better than the teacher LLM, while maintaining strong computational efficiency.
In addition, it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for bundle generation.

Motivation: 监督学习方法在新领域需要昂贵的数据注释，而且注释偏差导致模型迁移性差。但在实际应用中缺乏标签数据且需要可复现性的场景下，零样本方法更具价值。

Method: 提出了新的技术，组合多个思维链代理，并利用大语言模型的标记级别不确定性评分。实验中使用了Llama和Qwen模型的3B和70B+参数版本。

Result: 证明了这些方法能够满足实际需求，并开启了在标签稀缺条件下如何评估准确性的讨论。

Conclusion: 研究为零样本情感分析提供了可行的解决方案，尤其适用于数据注释资源有限的场景，并推动了对标签稀缺条件下评估标准的讨论。

Abstract: Aspect-category sentiment analysis provides granular insights by identifying
specific themes within product reviews that are associated with particular
opinions. Supervised learning approaches dominate the field. However, data is
scarce and expensive to annotate for new domains. We argue that leveraging
large language models in a zero-shot setting is beneficial where the time and
resources required for dataset annotation are limited. Furthermore, annotation
bias may lead to strong results using supervised methods but transfer poorly to
new domains in contexts that lack annotations and demand reproducibility. In
our work, we propose novel techniques that combine multiple chain-of-thought
agents by leveraging large language models' token-level uncertainty scores. We
experiment with the 3B and 70B+ parameter size variants of Llama and Qwen
models, demonstrating how these approaches can fulfil practical needs and
opening a discussion on how to gauge accuracy in label-scarce conditions.

Abstract: The pursuit of human-level artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly
advanced the development of autonomous agents and Large Language Models (LLMs).
LLMs are now widely utilized as decision-making agents for their ability to
interpret instructions, manage sequential tasks, and adapt through feedback.
This review examines recent developments in employing LLMs as autonomous agents
and tool users and comprises seven research questions. We only used the papers
published between 2023 and 2025 in conferences of the A* and A rank and Q1
journals. A structured analysis of the LLM agents' architectural design
principles, dividing their applications into single-agent and multi-agent
systems, and strategies for integrating external tools is presented. In
addition, the cognitive mechanisms of LLM, including reasoning, planning, and
memory, and the impact of prompting methods and fine-tuning procedures on agent
performance are also investigated. Furthermore, we evaluated current benchmarks
and assessment protocols and have provided an analysis of 68 publicly available
datasets to assess the performance of LLM-based agents in various tasks. In
conducting this review, we have identified critical findings on verifiable
reasoning of LLMs, the capacity for self-improvement, and the personalization
of LLM-based agents. Finally, we have discussed ten future research directions
to overcome these gaps.

Abstract: Interactive online learning environments, represented by Massive AI-empowered
Courses (MAIC), leverage LLM-driven multi-agent systems to transform passive
MOOCs into dynamic, text-based platforms, enhancing interactivity through LLMs.
This paper conducts an empirical study on a specific MAIC course to explore
three research questions about dropouts in these interactive online courses:
(1) What factors might lead to dropouts? (2) Can we predict dropouts? (3) Can
we reduce dropouts? We analyze interaction logs to define dropouts and identify
contributing factors. Our findings reveal strong links between dropout
behaviors and textual interaction patterns. We then propose a
course-progress-adaptive dropout prediction framework (CPADP) to predict
dropouts with at most 95.4% accuracy. Based on this, we design a personalized
email recall agent to re-engage at-risk students. Applied in the deployed MAIC
system with over 3,000 students, the feasibility and effectiveness of our
approach have been validated on students with diverse backgrounds.

Motivation: 传统LoRA方法使用低秩分解近似参数更新，但在下游任务中相比全参数微调存在性能差距，需要克服低秩瓶颈问题。

Method: 在LoRA的两个低秩矩阵之间集成剪枝模块，实现动态低秩子空间学习，通过连续调整学习子空间来提升性能。

Conclusion: DropLoRA通过动态子空间学习机制有效解决了LoRA的性能瓶颈问题，在不增加额外成本的情况下显著提升了微调效果。

Abstract: LoRA-based large model parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods use
low-rank de- composition to approximate updates to model parameters. However,
compared to full- parameter fine-tuning, low-rank updates often lead to a
performance gap in downstream tasks. To address this, we introduce DropLoRA, a
novel pruning-based approach that focuses on pruning the rank dimension. Unlike
conven- tional methods that attempt to overcome the low-rank bottleneck,
DropLoRA innovatively integrates a pruning module between the two low-rank
matrices in LoRA to simulate dy- namic subspace learning. This dynamic low-
rank subspace learning allows DropLoRA to overcome the limitations of
traditional LoRA, which operates within a static subspace. By continuously
adapting the learning subspace, DropLoRA significantly boosts performance
without incurring additional training or infer- ence costs. Our experimental
results demon- strate that DropLoRA consistently outperforms LoRA in
fine-tuning the LLaMA series across a wide range of large language model gener-
ation tasks, including commonsense reason- ing, mathematical reasoning, code
generation, and instruction-following. Our code is avail- able at

Conclusion: 通过法律知识图谱的方法有效地捐揍了法律推理的结构化特征，提供了比现有方法更准确的法律条文检索能力，为自动化法律推理分析开启了新方向。

Abstract: Court judgments reveal how legal rules have been interpreted and applied to
facts, providing a foundation for understanding structured legal reasoning.
However, existing automated approaches for capturing legal reasoning, including
large language models, often fail to identify the relevant legal context, do
not accurately trace how facts relate to legal norms, and may misrepresent the
layered structure of judicial reasoning. These limitations hinder the ability
to capture how courts apply the law to facts in practice. In this paper, we
address these challenges by constructing a legal knowledge graph from 648
Japanese administrative court decisions. Our method extracts components of
legal reasoning using prompt-based large language models, normalizes references
to legal provisions, and links facts, norms, and legal applications through an
ontology of legal inference. The resulting graph captures the full structure of
legal reasoning as it appears in real court decisions, making implicit
reasoning explicit and machine-readable. We evaluate our system using expert
annotated data, and find that it achieves more accurate retrieval of relevant
legal provisions from facts than large language model baselines and
retrieval-augmented methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的阿拉伯语方言处理模型将方言视为离散类别，ALDi方法将复杂变异简化为单一维度，需要更细粒度的词汇级通用性度量方法。

Method: 提出AGS评分系统，采用包含词对齐、词源感知编辑距离和平滑处理的流水线方法标注平行语料库，然后训练回归模型预测上下文中的AGS值。

Result: 该方法在多方言基准测试中表现优于强基线模型，包括最先进的方言识别系统，证明了AGS的有效性。

Conclusion: AGS提供了一种可扩展的、基于语言学基础的方法来建模词汇通用性，丰富了阿拉伯语方言性的表示，是对现有方言度量的重要补充。

Abstract: Arabic dialects form a diverse continuum, yet NLP models often treat them as
discrete categories. Recent work addresses this issue by modeling dialectness
as a continuous variable, notably through the Arabic Level of Dialectness
(ALDi). However, ALDi reduces complex variation to a single dimension. We
propose a complementary measure: the Arabic Generality Score (AGS), which
quantifies how widely a word is used across dialects. We introduce a pipeline
that combines word alignment, etymology-aware edit distance, and smoothing to
annotate a parallel corpus with word-level AGS. A regression model is then
trained to predict AGS in context. Our approach outperforms strong baselines,
including state-of-the-art dialect ID systems, on a multi-dialect benchmark.
AGS offers a scalable, linguistically grounded way to model lexical generality,
enriching representations of Arabic dialectness.

<details>

Motivation: 现有推测解码方法使用固定的推测长度和验证标准，无法适应不同模型不确定性和输入复杂度，限制了其适应性和效率

Method: 利用熵和边界不确定性度量来动态调整每轮推测生成的token数量，并使用相同置信度信号调制验证过程，实现更灵活的token接受

Result: 在机器翻译和摘要任务上相比标准推测解码获得显著加速，同时保持或改进了BLEU和ROUGE分数

Conclusion: 提出了一种原则性的即插即用方法，可在不同不确定性条件下实现大型语言模型的高效鲁棒解码

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating
autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a
draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting
lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across
varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an
information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on
confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based
uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed
method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each
iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves
resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the
verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling
more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation
quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate
significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or
improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled,
plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under
varying conditions of uncertainty.

Result: 生成和代码切换任务平均得分4.92/5，现代标准阿拉伯语处理4.74/5，推理能力4.64/5，方言保真度4.21/5，安全性表现4.54/5

Conclusion: ALLaM-34B是一个强大且文化根基深厚的阿拉伯语大语言模型，展现出技术实力和实际部署的实用性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained primarily on English corpora often
struggle to capture the linguistic and cultural nuances of Arabic. To address
this gap, the Saudi Data and AI Authority (SDAIA) introduced the $ALLaM$ family
of Arabic-focused models. The most capable of these available to the public,
$ALLaM-34B$, was subsequently adopted by HUMAIN, who developed and deployed
HUMAIN Chat, a closed conversational web service built on this model. This
paper presents an expanded and refined UI-level evaluation of $ALLaM-34B$.
Using a prompt pack spanning modern standard Arabic, five regional dialects,
code-switching, factual knowledge, arithmetic and temporal reasoning, creative
generation, and adversarial safety, we collected 115 outputs (23 prompts times
5 runs) and scored each with three frontier LLM judges (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro,
Claude Sonnet-4). We compute category-level means with 95\% confidence
intervals, analyze score distributions, and visualize dialect-wise metric heat
maps. The updated analysis reveals consistently high performance on generation
and code-switching tasks (both averaging 4.92/5), alongside strong results in
MSA handling (4.74/5), solid reasoning ability (4.64/5), and improved dialect
fidelity (4.21/5). Safety-related prompts show stable, reliable performance of
(4.54/5). Taken together, these results position $ALLaM-34B$ as a robust and
culturally grounded Arabic LLM, demonstrating both technical strength and
practical readiness for real-world deployment.

*Sameer Komoravolu,Khalil Mrini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ATA是一个元代理测试框架，通过代码分析、设计者询问、文献挖掘和对抗测试生成来自动评估LLM代理，比人工测试更快更全面地发现故障


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理评估主要依赖静态基准和小规模人工研究，缺乏自动化、全面且自适应的测试方法

Method: 结合静态代码分析、设计者询问、文献挖掘和基于人设的对抗测试生成，通过法官反馈调整测试难度，使用LLM作为法官评分

Result: 在旅行规划器和维基百科写作任务中，ATA比专家标注者发现更多样化和严重的故障，测试时间从数天缩短到20-30分钟

Conclusion: ATA提供了一种高效、可扩展的代理测试方法，能够输出量化指标和定性错误报告，代码分析和大搜索对测试质量至关重要

Abstract: LLM agents are increasingly deployed to plan, retrieve, and write with tools,
yet evaluation still leans on static benchmarks and small human studies. We
present the Agent-Testing Agent (ATA), a meta-agent that combines static code
analysis, designer interrogation, literature mining, and persona-driven
adversarial test generation whose difficulty adapts via judge feedback. Each
dialogue is scored with an LLM-as-a-Judge (LAAJ) rubric and used to steer
subsequent tests toward the agent's weakest capabilities. On a travel planner
and a Wikipedia writer, the ATA surfaces more diverse and severe failures than
expert annotators while matching severity, and finishes in 20--30 minutes
versus ten-annotator rounds that took days. Ablating code analysis and web
search increases variance and miscalibration, underscoring the value of
evidence-grounded test generation. The ATA outputs quantitative metrics and
qualitative bug reports for developers. We release the full methodology and
open-source implementation for reproducible agent testing:

TL;DR: DashboardQA是首个专门评估视觉语言GUI代理理解交互式仪表板能力的基准测试，包含112个交互式仪表板和405个问答对，测试结果显示现有代理在此任务上表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据可视化问答基准主要关注静态图表，忽视了交互式仪表板的丰富交互性，无法有效评估现代多模态GUI代理的能力。

Method: 创建DashboardQA基准，包含来自Tableau Public的112个交互式仪表板和405个问答对，涵盖五种问题类型：多选题、事实型、假设型、多仪表板和对话型。

Result: 评估显示现有GUI代理在仪表板推理方面表现不佳，最佳代理（基于Gemini-Pro-2.5）准确率仅为38.69%，OpenAI CUA代理仅为22.69%。

Conclusion: 交互式仪表板推理对所有评估的VLM来说都是具有挑战性的任务，需要改进仪表板元素定位、交互轨迹规划和推理能力。

Abstract: Dashboards are powerful visualization tools for data-driven decision-making,
integrating multiple interactive views that allow users to explore, filter, and
navigate data. Unlike static charts, dashboards support rich interactivity,
which is essential for uncovering insights in real-world analytical workflows.
However, existing question-answering benchmarks for data visualizations largely
overlook this interactivity, focusing instead on static charts. This limitation
severely constrains their ability to evaluate the capabilities of modern
multimodal agents designed for GUI-based reasoning. To address this gap, we
introduce DashboardQA, the first benchmark explicitly designed to assess how
vision-language GUI agents comprehend and interact with real-world dashboards.
The benchmark includes 112 interactive dashboards from Tableau Public and 405
question-answer pairs with interactive dashboards spanning five categories:
multiple-choice, factoid, hypothetical, multi-dashboard, and conversational. By
assessing a variety of leading closed- and open-source GUI agents, our analysis
reveals their key limitations, particularly in grounding dashboard elements,
planning interaction trajectories, and performing reasoning. Our findings
indicate that interactive dashboard reasoning is a challenging task overall for
all the VLMs evaluated. Even the top-performing agents struggle; for instance,
the best agent based on Gemini-Pro-2.5 achieves only 38.69% accuracy, while the
OpenAI CUA agent reaches just 22.69%, demonstrating the benchmark's significant
difficulty. We release DashboardQA at https://github.com/vis-nlp/DashboardQA

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级的检索优先、LLM支持的声明归一化方法，在CheckThat! 2025 Task 2中，该方法在13种语言的单语任务中7种排名第一，但在零样本设置下表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 声明归一化是自动事实核查系统的关键组成部分，需要将嘈杂的社交媒体帖子等数据解析为标准化声明，以便进行下游真实性分类任务。

Method: 采用检索优先、LLM支持的轻量级流水线，动态提示GPT-4o-mini并提供上下文示例，或直接从训练数据集中检索最接近的归一化结果。

Result: 在官方测试集上，系统在大多数单语任务中排名靠前，在13种语言中的7种获得第一名，但在零样本设置下表现不佳。

Conclusion: 所提出的解决方案在单语环境下表现优异，但在跨语言零样本迁移方面存在局限性，需要进一步改进以适应更广泛的应用场景。

Abstract: Claim normalization is an integral part of any automatic fact-check
verification system. It parses the typically noisy claim data, such as social
media posts into normalized claims, which are then fed into downstream veracity
classification tasks. The CheckThat! 2025 Task 2 focuses specifically on claim
normalization and spans 20 languages under monolingual and zero-shot
conditions. Our proposed solution consists of a lightweight
\emph{retrieval-first, LLM-backed} pipeline, in which we either dynamically
prompt a GPT-4o-mini with in-context examples, or retrieve the closest
normalization from the train dataset directly. On the official test set, the
system ranks near the top for most monolingual tracks, achieving first place in
7 out of of the 13 languages. In contrast, the system underperforms in the
zero-shot setting, highlighting the limitation of the proposed solution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度语言在自然语言处理中面临复杂性和数据稀缺的挑战，特别是马拉地语这类低资源语言缺乏高质量的释义数据集，阻碍了相关NLP任务的发展。

Method: 构建了由人工专家标注的高质量释义语料库，包含8000个句子对（释义/非释义），并在此数据集上测试了基于transformer的BERT模型性能。

Result: 创建了首个马拉地语释义数据集，提供了标准BERT模型在该数据集上的基准性能结果，数据集和模型已公开分享。

Conclusion: 这项工作填补了马拉地语释义数据集的空白，为低资源印度语言的NLP研究提供了重要资源，推动了相关语言理解任务的发展。

Abstract: Paraphrases are a vital tool to assist language understanding tasks such as
question answering, style transfer, semantic parsing, and data augmentation
tasks. Indic languages are complex in natural language processing (NLP) due to
their rich morphological and syntactic variations, diverse scripts, and limited
availability of annotated data. In this work, we present the
L3Cube-MahaParaphrase Dataset, a high-quality paraphrase corpus for Marathi, a
low resource Indic language, consisting of 8,000 sentence pairs, each annotated
by human experts as either Paraphrase (P) or Non-paraphrase (NP). We also
present the results of standard transformer-based BERT models on these
datasets. The dataset and model are publicly shared at

TL;DR: DuET-PD框架评估LLM在说服性对话中的立场变化，发现GPT-4o在误导性说服下准确率仅27.32%，并提出Holistic DPO训练方法显著提升模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在说服性对话中难以平衡对错误信息的轻信和对有效纠正的抵抗，这对可靠部署构成关键挑战。

Method: 引入DuET-PD双评估框架，从说服类型（纠正性/误导性）和领域（知识/安全）两个维度评估多轮立场变化动态，并提出Holistic DPO训练方法平衡正负说服样本。

Result: GPT-4o在持续误导性说服下MMLU-Pro准确率仅27.32%；开源模型呈现谄媚趋势增加；Holistic DPO将Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct在安全上下文误导性说服下的准确率从4.21%提升至76.54%。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发更可靠和适应性的多轮对话LLM提供了有效途径，Holistic DPO方法能同时增强对错误信息的鲁棒性和对纠正的接受度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can struggle to balance gullibility to
misinformation and resistance to valid corrections in persuasive dialogues, a
critical challenge for reliable deployment. We introduce DuET-PD (Dual
Evaluation for Trust in Persuasive Dialogues), a framework evaluating
multi-turn stance-change dynamics across dual dimensions: persuasion type
(corrective/misleading) and domain (knowledge via MMLU-Pro, and safety via
SALAD-Bench). We find that even a state-of-the-art model like GPT-4o achieves
only 27.32% accuracy in MMLU-Pro under sustained misleading persuasions.
Moreover, results reveal a concerning trend of increasing sycophancy in newer
open-source models. To address this, we introduce Holistic DPO, a training
approach balancing positive and negative persuasion examples. Unlike prompting
or resist-only training, Holistic DPO enhances both robustness to
misinformation and receptiveness to corrections, improving
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct's accuracy under misleading persuasion in safety contexts
from 4.21% to 76.54%. These contributions offer a pathway to developing more
reliable and adaptable LLMs for multi-turn dialogue. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究分析了三类动词性多词表达式对机器翻译质量的影响，发现这些表达式会降低翻译质量，并提出基于大语言模型的释义方法能显著改善动词习语和动词-助词结构的翻译效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动词性多词表达式(VMWEs)由于复杂且通常非组合的性质，对自然语言处理构成重大挑战。尽管机器翻译模型近年来因语言模型的发展而有显著改进，但准确翻译这些复杂语言结构仍是一个未解决的问题。

Method: 使用已建立的多词表达式数据集和从机器翻译数据集中提取的包含这些语言现象的句子，评估最先进的翻译系统处理这些表达式的能力。同时提出基于大语言模型的释义方法，将这些表达式替换为其字面对应形式。

Result: 实验结果表明，动词性多词表达式对翻译质量产生负面影响。基于大语言模型的释义方法在动词习语和动词-助词结构的翻译质量上显示出显著改善。

Conclusion: 动词性多词表达式是机器翻译中的一个重要挑战，通过释义方法可以有效改善特定类型表达式的翻译质量，为处理这类复杂语言现象提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Verbal multiword expressions (VMWEs) present significant challenges for
natural language processing due to their complex and often non-compositional
nature. While machine translation models have seen significant improvement with
the advent of language models in recent years, accurately translating these
complex linguistic structures remains an open problem. In this study, we
analyze the impact of three VMWE categories -- verbal idioms, verb-particle
constructions, and light verb constructions -- on machine translation quality
from English to multiple languages. Using both established multiword expression
datasets and sentences containing these language phenomena extracted from
machine translation datasets, we evaluate how state-of-the-art translation
systems handle these expressions. Our experimental results consistently show
that VMWEs negatively affect translation quality. We also propose an LLM-based
paraphrasing approach that replaces these expressions with their literal
counterparts, demonstrating significant improvement in translation quality for
verbal idioms and verb-particle constructions.

TL;DR: 通过TF-IDF语句排名策略，保留前50%最关键语句，在保持分类准确性的同时将推理时间减少35%，实现高效的长文档零样本分类


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型如BERT在短文本分类中表现优异，但因输入长度限制和计算效率问题，在长文档分类(LDC)中遇到困难

Method: 提出一种高效的零样本方法，利用语句排名来减少输入上下文，而不改变模型结构。通过TF-IDF基于的排名策略选择最信息密集的语句

Result: 在MahaNews马拉基语新闻数据集上，保留前50%排名语句可以维持与全文档推理相当的性能，同时减少推理时间达35%

Conclusion: 语句排名是一种简单但有效的技术，可以实现可扩展和高效的零样本长文档分类

Abstract: Transformer-based models like BERT excel at short text classification but
struggle with long document classification (LDC) due to input length
limitations and computational inefficiencies. In this work, we propose an
efficient, zero-shot approach to LDC that leverages sentence ranking to reduce
input context without altering the model architecture. Our method enables the
adaptation of models trained on short texts, such as headlines, to long-form
documents by selecting the most informative sentences using a TF-IDF-based
ranking strategy. Using the MahaNews dataset of long Marathi news articles, we
evaluate three context reduction strategies that prioritize essential content
while preserving classification accuracy. Our results show that retaining only
the top 50\% ranked sentences maintains performance comparable to full-document
inference while reducing inference time by up to 35\%. This demonstrates that
sentence ranking is a simple yet effective technique for scalable and efficient
zero-shot LDC.

TL;DR: 提出首个端到端法语SSML标记插入管道，通过双模型架构实现韵律控制，显著提升合成语音的自然度和表现力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业TTS系统在韵律控制方面存在局限，导致合成语音缺乏表现力，需要更好的方法来控制音高、语速、音量和停顿

Method: 采用级联架构，使用两个QLoRA微调的Qwen 2.5-7B模型：一个预测短语断点位置，另一个进行韵律目标回归，生成商业TTS兼容的SSML标记

Result: 在14小时法语播客语料上，断点放置F1达99.2%，音高、语速和音量的平均绝对误差比仅提示的LLM和BiLSTM基线降低25-40%；感知评估显示自然度显著提升，平均意见分从3.20提高到3.87

Conclusion: 该方法在缩小法语合成语音与自然语音的表现力差距方面取得实质性进展，代码已开源

Abstract: Despite recent advances, synthetic voices often lack expressiveness due to
limited prosody control in commercial text-to-speech (TTS) systems. We
introduce the first end-to-end pipeline that inserts Speech Synthesis Markup
Language (SSML) tags into French text to control pitch, speaking rate, volume,
and pause duration. We employ a cascaded architecture with two QLoRA-fine-tuned
Qwen 2.5-7B models: one predicts phrase-break positions and the other performs
regression on prosodic targets, generating commercial TTS-compatible SSML
markup. Evaluated on a 14-hour French podcast corpus, our method achieves 99.2%
F1 for break placement and reduces mean absolute error on pitch, rate, and
volume by 25-40% compared with prompting-only large language models (LLMs) and
a BiLSTM baseline. In perceptual evaluation involving 18 participants across
over 9 hours of synthesized audio, SSML-enhanced speech generated by our
pipeline significantly improves naturalness, with the mean opinion score
increasing from 3.20 to 3.87 (p < 0.005). Additionally, 15 of 18 listeners
preferred our enhanced synthesis. These results demonstrate substantial
progress in bridging the expressiveness gap between synthetic and natural
French speech. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 多智能体辩论(MAD)的性能提升主要来自多数投票机制，而非辩论过程本身。理论分析表明辩论本身不会提高期望正确率，但通过有偏干预可以增强辩论效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多智能体辩论(MAD)在提升大语言模型性能方面显示出潜力，但其有效性的关键驱动因素尚不清楚，需要系统性地分析辩论和投票各自的作用。

Method: 将MAD解耦为多数投票和智能体间辩论两个组件，通过7个NLP基准测试进行实验验证，并建立理论框架将辩论建模为随机过程，证明其形成信念轨迹的鞅过程。

Result: 多数投票单独贡献了MAD的大部分性能增益，辩论本身不会提高期望正确率，但通过有偏干预可以显著提升辩论效果。

Conclusion: 虽然MAD有潜力，但在许多实际场景中，简单的集成方法仍然是更强大和可靠的选择。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Debate~(MAD) has emerged as a promising paradigm for improving
the performance of large language models through collaborative reasoning.
Despite recent advances, the key factors driving MAD's effectiveness remain
unclear. In this work, we disentangle MAD into two key components--Majority
Voting and inter-agent Debate--and assess their respective contributions.
Through extensive experiments across seven NLP benchmarks, we find that
Majority Voting alone accounts for most of the performance gains typically
attributed to MAD. To explain this, we propose a theoretical framework that
models debate as a stochastic process. We prove that it induces a martingale
over agents' belief trajectories, implying that debate alone does not improve
expected correctness. Guided by these insights, we demonstrate that targeted
interventions, by biasing the belief update toward correction, can meaningfully
enhance debate effectiveness. Overall, our findings suggest that while MAD has
potential, simple ensembling methods remain strong and more reliable
alternatives in many practical settings. Code is released in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前拟人化研究过度关注风险（如过度信任和用户欺骗），缺乏设计指导。作者认为拟人化应作为可调节的设计概念来支持用户目标。

Method: 从多学科角度提出拟人化设计框架，将线索分为四个维度：感知、语言、行为和认知，分析每个维度的表现和有效性。

Result: 建立了统一的分类法，为从业者提供了可操作的设计杠杆，并倡导基于功能的拟人化设计评估方法。

Conclusion: 拟人化应被视为设计者与解释者之间的交互过程，通过精心设计的线索来优化人机交互体验，而非单纯的风险规避对象。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit \textbf{anthropomorphism}
characteristics -- human-like qualities portrayed across their outlook,
language, behavior, and reasoning functions. Such characteristics enable more
intuitive and engaging human-AI interactions. However, current research on
anthropomorphism remains predominantly risk-focused, emphasizing over-trust and
user deception while offering limited design guidance. We argue that
anthropomorphism should instead be treated as a \emph{concept of design} that
can be intentionally tuned to support user goals. Drawing from multiple
disciplines, we propose that the anthropomorphism of an LLM-based artifact
should reflect the interaction between artifact designers and interpreters.
This interaction is facilitated by cues embedded in the artifact by the
designers and the (cognitive) responses of the interpreters to the cues. Cues
are categorized into four dimensions: \textit{perceptive, linguistic,
behavioral}, and \textit{cognitive}. By analyzing the manifestation and
effectiveness of each cue, we provide a unified taxonomy with actionable levers
for practitioners. Consequently, we advocate for function-oriented evaluations
of anthropomorphic design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现代NLP模型性能优异，但其决策过程仍是黑盒。因果NLP领域旨在结合因果推断理论与NLP模型来阐明文本特征的因果效应，提高模型可解释性。

Method: 开发了基于RieszNet的双头神经网络架构，通过正则化文本分类器来遵循估计的因果效应，并在半合成的IMDB影评数据上进行验证。

Result: CausalSent框架在IMDB数据上的治疗效果估计MAE比Bansal等人的方法降低了2-3倍。通过验证模型的集成，发现"love"一词的存在导致正面情感概率增加2.9%。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了因果推断方法在提高NLP模型可解释性方面的有效性，为理解文本特征对模型决策的因果影响提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Despite the overwhelming performance improvements offered by recent natural
language procesing (NLP) models, the decisions made by these models are largely
a black box. Towards closing this gap, the field of causal NLP combines causal
inference literature with modern NLP models to elucidate causal effects of text
features. We replicate and extend Bansal et al's work on regularizing text
classifiers to adhere to estimated effects, focusing instead on model
interpretability. Specifically, we focus on developing a two-headed
RieszNet-based neural network architecture which achieves better treatment
effect estimation accuracy. Our framework, CausalSent, accurately predicts
treatment effects in semi-synthetic IMDB movie reviews, reducing MAE of effect
estimates by 2-3x compared to Bansal et al's MAE on synthetic Civil Comments
data. With an ensemble of validated models, we perform an observational case
study on the causal effect of the word "love" in IMDB movie reviews, finding
that the presence of the word "love" causes a +2.9% increase in the probability
of a positive sentiment.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了UQ标准化测试平台，通过采集未解决的实际问题来评估AI模型的实际能力，解决了当前测试标准中难度与实际性的矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI测试标准存在难度-实际性矛盾：考试式测试往往人为增加难度但实际价值有限，而真实用户交互数据又偏向简单频繁问题。需要一种新的测试范式来评估前沿模型在真实世界问题上的能力。

Method: 提出UQ测试平台，采用三部分方法：(1) UQ-Dataset：从Stack Exchange等平台收集500个具有挑战性的未解决问题，通过规则筛选、LLM判断和人工审核确保质量；(2) UQ-Validators：利用生成器-验证器差距的复合验证策略；(3) UQ-Platform：开放平台让专家群体验证问题和解决方案。

Result: 最好的模型仅在15%的问题上通过了UQ验证，说明问题具有高难度。预先的人工验证已经识别出了通过验证的正确答案，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: UQ为评估前沿AI模型在真实世界问题上的表现提供了新的路径，成功解决这些问题不仅能够推进模型能力，还能够扩展人类知识边界。该平台已开源发布，为AI研究提供了一个有价值的测试标准。

Abstract: Benchmarks shape progress in AI research. A useful benchmark should be both
difficult and realistic: questions should challenge frontier models while also
reflecting real-world usage. Yet, current paradigms face a difficulty-realism
tension: exam-style benchmarks are often made artificially difficult with
limited real-world value, while benchmarks based on real user interaction often
skew toward easy, high-frequency problems. In this work, we explore a radically
different paradigm: assessing models on unsolved questions. Rather than a
static benchmark scored once, we curate unsolved questions and evaluate models
asynchronously over time with validator-assisted screening and community
verification. We introduce UQ, a testbed of 500 challenging, diverse questions
sourced from Stack Exchange, spanning topics from CS theory and math to sci-fi
and history, probing capabilities including reasoning, factuality, and
browsing. UQ is difficult and realistic by construction: unsolved questions are
often hard and naturally arise when humans seek answers, thus solving them
yields direct real-world value. Our contributions are threefold: (1) UQ-Dataset
and its collection pipeline combining rule-based filters, LLM judges, and human
review to ensure question quality (e.g., well-defined and difficult); (2)
UQ-Validators, compound validation strategies that leverage the
generator-validator gap to provide evaluation signals and pre-screen candidate
solutions for human review; and (3) UQ-Platform, an open platform where experts
collectively verify questions and solutions. The top model passes UQ-validation
on only 15% of questions, and preliminary human verification has already
identified correct answers among those that passed. UQ charts a path for
evaluating frontier models on real-world, open-ended challenges, where success
pushes the frontier of human knowledge. We release UQ at

Motivation: 探索剪枝技术对LLM意见摘要公平性的影响，特别是在可能影响公众观点的意见摘要任务中，这一领域尚未被研究。

Method: 使用三种最先进的剪枝方法和不同校准集，在三个开源LLM上使用四个公平性指标进行系统性分析，并提出了HGLA（高梯度低激活）剪枝方法。

Result: 发现剪枝方法比校准集对公平性影响更大；HGLA方法相比现有方法能更好地保持甚至提高公平性；人工评估显示HGLA生成的输出更公平。

Conclusion: HGLA剪枝方法在保持模型性能的同时，能有效维护LLM生成内容的公平性，在传统方法存在局限性的模型和任务中表现出良好前景。

Abstract: Model compression through post-training pruning offers a way to reduce model

summaries remains unexplored, particularly for opinion summarisation where
biased outputs could influence public views.In this paper, we present a
comprehensive empirical analysis of opinion summarisation, examining three
state-of-the-art pruning methods and various calibration sets across three
open-source LLMs using four fairness metrics. Our systematic analysis reveals
that pruning methods have a greater impact on fairness than calibration sets.
Building on these insights, we propose High Gradient Low Activation (HGLA)
pruning, which identifies and removes parameters that are redundant for input
processing but influential in output generation. Our experiments demonstrate
that HGLA can better maintain or even improve fairness compared to existing
methods, showing promise across models and tasks where traditional methods have
limitations. Our human evaluation shows HGLA-generated outputs are fairer than
existing state-of-the-art pruning methods. Code is available at:

TL;DR: FASB框架通过动态跟踪LLM内部状态来决定干预的必要性和强度，并引入回溯机制纠正偏差，在TruthfulQA和多项选择题数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激活引导方法要么对所有生成内容进行无差别干预，要么仅依赖问题来决定干预，无法准确评估干预强度，且检测到偏差时为时已晚。

Method: 提出FASB框架，通过跟踪LLM生成过程中的内部状态动态决定干预需求和强度，并采用回溯机制纠正已生成的偏差token。

Result: 在TruthfulQA数据集和六个多项选择题数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于基线方法。

Conclusion: FASB框架能够更有效地对齐LLM行为，提供了一种成本效益高的激活引导方法，避免了微调的高成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across many
generation tasks. Nevertheless, effectively aligning them with desired
behaviors remains a significant challenge. Activation steering is an effective
and cost-efficient approach that directly modifies the activations of LLMs
during the inference stage, aligning their responses with the desired behaviors
and avoiding the high cost of fine-tuning. Existing methods typically
indiscriminately intervene to all generations or rely solely on the question to
determine intervention, which limits the accurate assessment of the
intervention strength. To this end, we propose the Flexible Activation Steering
with Backtracking (FASB) framework, which dynamically determines both the
necessity and strength of intervention by tracking the internal states of the
LLMs during generation, considering both the question and the generated
content. Since intervening after detecting a deviation from the desired
behavior is often too late, we further propose the backtracking mechanism to
correct the deviated tokens and steer the LLMs toward the desired behavior.
Extensive experiments on the TruthfulQA dataset and six multiple-choice
datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines. Our code will be
released at https://github.com/gjw185/FASB.

Motivation: 当前人机交互中情感语音的重要性日益凸显，但缺乏评估对话系统情感推理能力的系统性方法，需要解决情感语音数据稀缺的问题。

Method: 使用文本转语音技术生成多样化情感状态的数据集，提出跨轮情感推理评分(CERS)来评估多轮对话中的情感转换，采用连续、分类和感知三种度量方法评估七个对话系统。

Conclusion: 通过发布系统性评估基准，旨在推动情感感知口语对话建模向更自然、自适应的人机交互方向发展。

Abstract: Speech emotions play a crucial role in human-computer interaction, shaping
engagement and context-aware communication. Despite recent advances in spoken
dialogue systems, a holistic system for evaluating emotional reasoning is still
lacking. To address this, we introduce EMO-Reasoning, a benchmark for assessing
emotional coherence in dialogue systems. It leverages a curated dataset
generated via text-to-speech to simulate diverse emotional states, overcoming
the scarcity of emotional speech data. We further propose the Cross-turn
Emotion Reasoning Score to assess the emotion transitions in multi-turn
dialogues. Evaluating seven dialogue systems through continuous, categorical,
and perceptual metrics, we show that our framework effectively detects
emotional inconsistencies, providing insights for improving current dialogue
systems. By releasing a systematic evaluation benchmark, we aim to advance
emotion-aware spoken dialogue modeling toward more natural and adaptive
interactions.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种检测大语言模型推理完成点(RCP)的方法，通过识别补偿推理阶段的结束来避免过度思考，从而减少计算资源消耗并保持推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂推理任务中经常出现过度思考现象，这会降低整体性能并增加资源消耗。研究发现模型通常在补偿推理阶段产生正确答案，而推理收敛阶段容易触发过度思考。

Method: 通过分析思考长度和内容长度模式，将推理分为三个阶段，挖掘敏感的RCP模式，并开发基于启发式规则的轻量级阈值策略来检测推理完成点。

Result: 在AIME24、AIME25、GPQA-D等基准测试上的实验表明，该方法在保持或提高推理准确性的同时，显著减少了token消耗。

Conclusion: 提出的RCP检测方法能有效缓解大语言模型的过度思考问题，实现计算效率与推理准确性的平衡，为优化LLM推理过程提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enhance complex reasoning tasks by scaling the
individual thinking process. However, prior work shows that overthinking can
degrade overall performance. Motivated by observed patterns in thinking length
and content length, we categorize reasoning into three stages: insufficient
exploration stage, compensatory reasoning stage, and reasoning convergence
stage. Typically, LLMs produce correct answers in the compensatory reasoning
stage, whereas reasoning convergence often triggers overthinking, causing
increased resource usage or even infinite loops. Therefore, mitigating
overthinking hinges on detecting the end of the compensatory reasoning stage,
defined as the Reasoning Completion Point (RCP). RCP typically appears at the
end of the first complete reasoning cycle and can be identified by querying the
LLM sentence by sentence or monitoring the probability of an end-of-thinking
token (e.g., \texttt{</think>}), though these methods lack an efficient and
precise balance. To improve this, we mine more sensitive and consistent RCP
patterns and develop a lightweight thresholding strategy based on heuristic
rules. Experimental evaluations on benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25, GPQA-D)
demonstrate that the proposed method reduces token consumption while preserving
or enhancing reasoning accuracy.

<details>

Motivation: DPO在对齐大语言模型时存在奖励黑客问题，模型过度降低被拒绝补全的概率以获得高奖励，导致生成内容过长、缺乏多样性以及灾难性遗忘

Method: 提出Weights-Rotated Preference Optimization (RoPO)算法，隐式约束输出层logits的KL散度，显式约束中间隐藏状态的多粒度正交矩阵微调

Result: 在AlpacaEval 2上提升3.27分，在MT-Bench上超越最佳基线6.2-7.5分，仅使用0.015%的可训练参数

Conclusion: RoPO有效缓解了DPO的奖励黑客问题，保留了预训练和SFT阶段获得的知识和表达能力

Abstract: Despite the efficacy of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in aligning
Large Language Models (LLMs), reward hacking remains a pivotal challenge. This
issue emerges when LLMs excessively reduce the probability of rejected
completions to achieve high rewards, without genuinely meeting their intended
goals. As a result, this leads to overly lengthy generation lacking diversity,
as well as catastrophic forgetting of knowledge. We investigate the underlying
reason behind this issue, which is representation redundancy caused by neuron
collapse in the parameter space. Hence, we propose a novel Weights-Rotated
Preference Optimization (RoPO) algorithm, which implicitly constrains the
output layer logits with the KL divergence inherited from DPO and explicitly
constrains the intermediate hidden states by fine-tuning on a multi-granularity
orthogonal matrix. This design prevents the policy model from deviating too far
from the reference model, thereby retaining the knowledge and expressive
capabilities acquired during pre-training and SFT stages. Our RoPO achieves up
to a 3.27-point improvement on AlpacaEval 2, and surpasses the best baseline by
6.2 to 7.5 points on MT-Bench with merely 0.015% of the trainable parameters,
demonstrating its effectiveness in alleviating the reward hacking problem of
DPO.

Conclusion: 虽然半自动方法表现良好，但全自动文献综述生成在质量和深度分析方面仍有明显不足，需要进一步改进

Abstract: Automatic survey generation has emerged as a key task in scientific document
processing. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating
survey texts, the lack of standardized evaluation datasets critically hampers
rigorous assessment of their performance against human-written surveys. In this
work, we present SurveyGen, a large-scale dataset comprising over 4,200
human-written surveys across diverse scientific domains, along with 242,143
cited references and extensive quality-related metadata for both the surveys
and the cited papers. Leveraging this resource, we build QUAL-SG, a novel
quality-aware framework for survey generation that enhances the standard
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline by incorporating quality-aware
indicators into literature retrieval to assess and select higher-quality source
papers. Using this dataset and framework, we systematically evaluate
state-of-the-art LLMs under varying levels of human involvement - from fully
automatic generation to human-guided writing. Experimental results and human
evaluations show that while semi-automatic pipelines can achieve partially
competitive outcomes, fully automatic survey generation still suffers from low
citation quality and limited critical analysis.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在参数记忆与外部上下文之间存在知识冲突时，现有对比解码方法缺乏适应性且在低冲突场景下性能下降

Method: CoCoA算法利用熵差和上下文峰值度等置信度感知度量，以及参数化分布与上下文分布之间的广义散度进行冲突解决

Result: 在多个QA、摘要和长格式问答基准测试中，CoCoA相比强基线AdaCAD平均提升QA准确率9.2个百分点，在摘要和LFQA的事实性上平均提升2.5个百分点

Conclusion: CoCoA能够实现更知情、上下文感知且最终更忠实的token生成，对冲突变化表现出优越的敏感性

Abstract: Faithful generation in large language models (LLMs) is challenged by
knowledge conflicts between parametric memory and external context. Existing
contrastive decoding methods tuned specifically to handle conflict often lack
adaptability and can degrade performance in low conflict settings. We introduce
CoCoA (Confidence- and Context-Aware Adaptive Decoding), a novel token-level
algorithm for principled conflict resolution and enhanced faithfulness. CoCoA
resolves conflict by utilizing confidence-aware measures (entropy gap and
contextual peakedness) and the generalized divergence between the parametric
and contextual distributions. Crucially, CoCoA maintains strong performance
even in low conflict settings. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs on
diverse Question Answering (QA), Summarization, and Long-Form Question
Answering (LFQA) benchmarks demonstrate CoCoA's state-of-the-art performance
over strong baselines like AdaCAD. It yields significant gains in QA accuracy,
up to 9.2 points on average compared to the strong baseline AdaCAD, and
improves factuality in summarization and LFQA by up to 2.5 points on average
across key benchmarks. Additionally, it demonstrates superior sensitivity to
conflict variations. CoCoA enables more informed, context-aware, and ultimately
more faithful token generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要处理标签偏移或简单的基于域的分割，忽视了文本-结构多样性的复杂性。在社交网络等文本丰富网络中，OOD可能源于bot和正常用户之间不同的语言模式，需要更全面的检测框架。

Method: 1) TextTopoOOD框架评估四种OOD场景：属性级偏移、结构偏移、主题引导标签偏移和基于域的分割；2) TNT-OOD方法使用交叉注意力模块融合局部结构到节点级文本表示，以及HyperNetwork生成节点特定变换参数。

Result: 在11个数据集和四种OOD场景上的实验表明，TextTopoOOD能够有效评估文本丰富网络中的OOD检测，展示了该方法在处理结构和文本偏移方面的优势。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个全面的框架和方法来解决文本丰富网络中复杂的OOD检测问题，通过融合文本和拓扑特征来增强ID/OOD区分能力，为这一领域的评估提供了新的基准。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection remains challenging in text-rich
networks, where textual features intertwine with topological structures.
Existing methods primarily address label shifts or rudimentary domain-based
splits, overlooking the intricate textual-structural diversity. For example, in
social networks, where users represent nodes with textual features (name, bio)
while edges indicate friendship status, OOD may stem from the distinct language
patterns between bot and normal users. To address this gap, we introduce the
TextTopoOOD framework for evaluating detection across diverse OOD scenarios:
(1) attribute-level shifts via text augmentations and embedding perturbations;
(2) structural shifts through edge rewiring and semantic connections; (3)
thematically-guided label shifts; and (4) domain-based divisions. Furthermore,
we propose TNT-OOD to model the complex interplay between Text aNd Topology
using: 1) a novel cross-attention module to fuse local structure into
node-level text representations, and 2) a HyperNetwork to generate
node-specific transformation parameters. This aligns topological and semantic
features of ID nodes, enhancing ID/OOD distinction across structural and
textual shifts. Experiments on 11 datasets across four OOD scenarios
demonstrate the nuanced challenge of TextTopoOOD for evaluating OOD detection
in text-rich networks.

Method: 提出实验方法：保持总参数量不变，增加某些层的FFN维度，完全移除其他层的FFN，从头训练不同规模（285M-1.2B参数）和层数（12-40层）的模型

Result: 将FFN集中在70%的连续中间层的配置，在多个下游任务中持续优于标准配置

Conclusion: FFN在Transformer不同层的重要性分布不均，中间层FFN对模型性能更为关键，优化FFN层分布可提升模型效率

Abstract: This study investigates the layerwise importance of feed-forward networks
(FFNs) in Transformer-based language models during pretraining. We introduce an
experimental approach that, while maintaining the total parameter count,
increases the FFN dimensions in some layers and completely removes the FFNs
from other layers. Furthermore, since our focus is on the importance of FFNs
during pretraining, we train models from scratch to examine whether the
importance of FFNs varies depending on their layer positions, rather than using
publicly available pretrained models as is frequently done. Through
comprehensive evaluations of models with varying sizes (285M, 570M, and 1.2B
parameters) and layer counts (12, 24, and 40 layers), we demonstrate that
concentrating FFNs in 70% of the consecutive middle layers consistently
outperforms standard configurations for multiple downstream tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for downstream tasks such as
tabular classification, where ensuring fairness in their outputs is critical
for inclusivity, equal representation, and responsible AI deployment. This
study introduces a novel approach to enhancing LLM performance and fairness
through the concept of a dynamic validation set, which evolves alongside the
test set, replacing the traditional static validation approach. We also propose
an iterative algorithm, SMITE, to select optimal in-context examples, with each
example set validated against its corresponding dynamic validation set. The
in-context set with the lowest total error is used as the final demonstration
set. Our experiments across four different LLMs show that our proposed
techniques significantly improve both predictive accuracy and fairness compared
to baseline methods. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply dynamic
validation in the context of in-context learning for LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
(NLP) but pose risks of inadvertently exposing copyrighted or proprietary data,
especially when such data is used for training but not intended for
distribution. Traditional methods address these leaks only after content is
generated, which can lead to the exposure of sensitive information. This study
introduces a proactive approach: examining LLMs' internal states before text
generation to detect potential leaks. By using a curated dataset of copyrighted
materials, we trained a neural network classifier to identify risks, allowing
for early intervention by stopping the generation process or altering outputs
to prevent disclosure. Integrated with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
system, this framework ensures adherence to copyright and licensing
requirements while enhancing data privacy and ethical standards. Our results
show that analyzing internal states effectively mitigates the risk of
copyrighted data leakage, offering a scalable solution that fits smoothly into
AI workflows, ensuring compliance with copyright regulations while maintaining
high-quality text generation. The implementation is available on

Motivation: 发现GPT词汇表中许多中文词汇表示色情或赌博内容，需要定位这些污染词汇并研究其与训练数据的关系

Method: 1) 定义污染词汇分类 2) 微调LLM构建污染词汇检测器 3) 通过词汇出现频率推测训练数据污染程度

Result: GPT词汇表表现最差，超过23%的中文长词汇是色情或赌博内容；推测GPT-4o训练数据中约0.5%是特定色情相关内容

Conclusion: LLM词汇表中广泛存在污染词汇，GPT问题最严重，训练数据污染是主要原因，需要更好的数据清洗方法

Abstract: Tokens are basic elements in the datasets for LLM training. It is well-known
that many tokens representing Chinese phrases in the vocabulary of GPT
(4o/4o-mini/o1/o3/4.5/4.1/o4-mini) are indicating contents like pornography or
online gambling. Based on this observation, our goal is to locate Polluted
Chinese (PoC) tokens in LLMs and study the relationship between PoC tokens'
existence and training data. (1) We give a formal definition and taxonomy of
PoC tokens based on the GPT's vocabulary. (2) We build a PoC token detector via
fine-tuning an LLM to label PoC tokens in vocabularies by considering each
token's both semantics and related contents from the search engines. (3) We
study the speculation on the training data pollution via PoC tokens'
appearances (token ID). Experiments on GPT and other 23 LLMs indicate that
tokens widely exist while GPT's vocabulary behaves the worst: more than 23%
long Chinese tokens (i.e., a token with more than two Chinese characters) are
either porn or online gambling. We validate the accuracy of our speculation
method on famous pre-training datasets like C4 and Pile. Then, considering
GPT-4o, we speculate that the ratio of "Yui Hatano" related webpages in
GPT-4o's training data is around 0.5%.

Result: 在Librispeech数据集上的评估显示，该方法在test-clean上降低偏置词错误率42%，在test-other上降低43%，同时保持非偏置词错误率基本不变。

Conclusion: 提出的合成驱动的多发音上下文偏置方法能有效提升罕见词识别性能，为零样本上下文ASR提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Contextual automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems allow for recognizing
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, such as named entities or rare words. However,
it remains challenging due to limited training data and ambiguous or
inconsistent pronunciations. In this paper, we propose a synthesis-driven
multi-pronunciation contextual biasing method that performs zero-shot
contextual ASR on a pretrained Whisper model. Specifically, we leverage
text-to-speech (TTS) systems to synthesize diverse speech samples containing
each target rare word, and then use the pretrained Whisper model to extract
multiple predicted pronunciation variants. These variant token sequences are
compiled into a prefix-trie, which assigns rewards to beam hypotheses in a
shallow-fusion manner during beam-search decoding. After which, any recognized
variant is mapped back to the original rare word in the final transcription.
The evaluation results on the Librispeech dataset show that our method reduces
biased word error rate (WER) by 42% on test-clean and 43% on test-other while
maintaining unbiased WER essentially unchanged.

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (RLLMs), such as OpenAI-O3 and DeepSeek-R1,
have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities by performing structured and
multi-step reasoning. However, recent studies reveal that RLLMs often suffer
from overthinking, i.e., producing unnecessarily lengthy reasoning chains even
for simple questions, leading to excessive token consumption and computational
inefficiency. Interestingly, we observe that when processing multiple questions
in batch mode, RLLMs exhibit more resource-efficient behavior by dynamically
compressing reasoning steps for easier problems, due to implicit resource
competition. Inspired by this, we propose Dynamic Reasoning Quota Allocation
(DRQA), a novel method that transfers the benefits of resource competition from
batch processing to single-question inference. Specifically, DRQA leverages
batch-generated preference data and reinforcement learning to train the model
to allocate reasoning resources adaptively. By encouraging the model to
internalize a preference for responses that are both accurate and concise, DRQA
enables it to generate concise answers for simple questions while retaining
sufficient reasoning depth for more challenging ones. Extensive experiments on
a wide range of mathematical and scientific reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
that DRQA significantly reduces token usage while maintaining, and in many
cases improving, answer accuracy. By effectively mitigating the overthinking
problem, DRQA offers a promising direction for more efficient and scalable
deployment of RLLMs, and we hope it inspires further exploration into
fine-grained control of reasoning behaviors.

Abstract: Introducing MARK, the Multi-stAge Reasoning frameworK for cultural value
survey response simulation, designed to enhance the accuracy, steerability, and
interpretability of large language models in this task. The system is inspired
by the type dynamics theory in the MBTI psychological framework for personality
research. It effectively predicts and utilizes human demographic information
for simulation: life-situational stress analysis, group-level personality
prediction, and self-weighted cognitive imitation. Experiments on the World
Values Survey show that MARK outperforms existing baselines by 10% accuracy and
reduces the divergence between model predictions and human preferences. This
highlights the potential of our framework to improve zero-shot personalization
and help social scientists interpret model predictions.

TL;DR: 本文对语音大语言模型中的离散标记和连续特征两种方法进行了公平比较，发现在各种任务中连续特征通常优于离散标记，两种方法在学习处理语音信息时表现出不同的特征和模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语音大语言模型的兴起，出现了离散标记和连续特征两种主要语音处理方法，但两者之间的性能差距尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 在相同实验设置下比较基于自监督学习的离散和连续特征，使用小规模和大规模LLM（Qwen1.5-0.5B和Llama3.1-8B），在六个口语理解相关任务上评估性能，并进行深入分析。

Result: 连续特征在各种任务中普遍优于离散标记，每种语音处理方法在学习处理语音信息时都表现出独特的特征和模式。

Conclusion: 研究结果为推进语音大语言模型中的口语理解提供了有价值的见解，表明连续特征在性能上具有优势。

Abstract: With the rise of Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs), two dominant
approaches have emerged for speech processing: discrete tokens and continuous
features. Each approach has demonstrated strong capabilities in audio-related
processing tasks. However, the performance gap between these two paradigms has
not been thoroughly explored. To address this gap, we present a fair comparison
of self-supervised learning (SSL)-based discrete and continuous features under
the same experimental settings. We evaluate their performance across six spoken
language understanding-related tasks using both small and large-scale LLMs
(Qwen1.5-0.5B and Llama3.1-8B). We further conduct in-depth analyses, including
efficient comparison, SSL layer analysis, LLM layer analysis, and robustness
comparison. Our findings reveal that continuous features generally outperform
discrete tokens in various tasks. Each speech processing method exhibits
distinct characteristics and patterns in how it learns and processes speech
information. We hope our results will provide valuable insights to advance
spoken language understanding in SpeechLLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出ILRe中间层检索方法，通过离线确定中间解码层、分块预填充编码和基于注意力分数的令牌召回，将长上下文处理复杂度从O(L²)降至O(L)，在1M令牌处理上实现180倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在长上下文场景中的有效上下文长度短、二次计算复杂度和高内存开销等问题。

Method: ILRe上下文压缩管道：离线确定中间解码层，分块流式预填充编码，基于注意力分数在指定层进行令牌召回，采用多池化核分配策略保持语义完整性。

Result: 单次处理1M令牌请求时间小于半分钟（加速约180倍），在RULER-1M基准测试中获得79.8分，性能达到或超过完整上下文处理。

Conclusion: ILRe无需额外训练或算子开发，即可高效处理超长上下文，显著降低计算复杂度和内存需求，为LLM长文本处理提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated success across many
benchmarks. However, they still exhibit limitations in long-context scenarios,
primarily due to their short effective context length, quadratic computational
complexity, and high memory overhead when processing lengthy inputs. To
mitigate these issues, we introduce a novel context compression pipeline,
called Intermediate Layer Retrieval (ILRe), which determines one intermediate
decoder layer offline, encodes context by streaming chunked prefill only up to
that layer, and recalls tokens by the attention scores between the input query
and full key cache in that specified layer. In particular, we propose a
multi-pooling kernels allocating strategy in the token recalling process to
maintain the completeness of semantics. Our approach not only reduces the
prefilling complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L)$, but also achieves performance
comparable to or better than the full context in the long context scenarios.
Without additional post training or operator development, ILRe can process a
single $1M$ tokens request in less than half a minute (speedup $\approx
180\times$) and scores RULER-$1M$ benchmark of $\approx 79.8$ with model
Llama-3.1-UltraLong-8B-1M-Instruct on a Huawei Ascend 910B NPU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有USKR方法依赖任务特定策略或定制化表示，阻碍了不同SKR任务间的壁垒消除，限制了在跨任务场景中的整体性能。

Method: 提出基于Python Pandas API的代码化统一知识表示，利用知识转移构建跨任务记忆，通过代码执行反馈自适应修正推理过程。

Result: 在3个SKR任务的6个基准测试中，Pandora优于现有统一推理框架，并能与任务特定方法有效竞争。

Conclusion: Pandora通过创新的代码化表示和知识转移机制，成功实现了统一结构化知识推理，展示了强大的跨任务推理能力。

Abstract: Unified Structured Knowledge Reasoning (USKR) aims to answer natural language
questions by using structured sources such as tables, databases, and knowledge
graphs in a unified way. Existing USKR methods rely on task-specific strategies
or bespoke representations, which hinder their ability to dismantle barriers
between different SKR tasks, thereby constraining their overall performance in
cross-task scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{Pandora}, a novel
USKR framework that addresses the limitations of existing methods by leveraging
two key innovations. First, we propose a code-based unified knowledge
representation using \textsc{Python}'s \textsc{Pandas} API, which aligns
seamlessly with the pre-training of LLMs. This representation facilitates a
cohesive approach to handling different structured knowledge sources. Building
on this foundation, we employ knowledge transfer to bolster the unified
reasoning process of LLMs by automatically building cross-task memory. By
adaptively correcting reasoning using feedback from code execution,
\textsc{Pandora} showcases impressive unified reasoning capabilities. Extensive
experiments on six widely used benchmarks across three SKR tasks demonstrate
that \textsc{Pandora} outperforms existing unified reasoning frameworks and
competes effectively with task-specific methods.

TL;DR: 本文分析了互联网上多语言信息获取的需求和技术挑战，指出英语在互联网上的主导地位限制了非英语用户的信息访问，需要解决语言障碍问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联网起源于英语国家，导致英语在网络上占据主导地位，但全球只有20-25%的人口以英语为母语，大量非英语用户因语言障碍无法充分访问互联网信息。

Method: 通过分析互联网使用增长数据和多语言用户趋势，研究多语言信息获取的需求以及相关的技术约束和挑战。

Result: 发现虽然互联网用户数量从1995年的1600万增长到2010年的16.5亿，但语言障碍仍然是限制信息获取的主要问题，现有解决方案仍存在巨大差距。

Conclusion: 需要进一步发展和完善多语言技术解决方案，以消除互联网上的语言障碍，使更多非英语用户能够平等地获取网络信息。

Abstract: The usage of Internet has grown exponentially over the last two decades. The
number of Internet users has grown from 16 Million to 1650 Million from 1995 to
2010. It has become a major repository of information catering almost every
area. Since the Internet has its origin in USA which is English speaking
country there is huge dominance of English on the World Wide Web. Although
English is a globally acceptable language, still there is a huge population in
the world which is not able to access the Internet due to language constraints.
It has been estimated that only 20-25% of the world population speaks English
as a native language. More and more people are accessing the Internet nowadays
removing the cultural and linguistic barriers and hence there is a high growth
in the number of non-English speaking users over the last few years on the
Internet. Although many solutions have been provided to remove the linguistic
barriers, still there is a huge gap to be filled. This paper attempts to
analyze the need of information availability in different languages and the
various technological constraints related to multi-linguism on the Internet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 避免依赖语言外部信息导致的循环证据和历史语言学工作流约束

Method: 提取语言特征、评分并概率映射，逐次精炼初始结果，通过识别和汇总出现模式实现收敛，融合语言学和统计线索

Result: 在英语、德语、法语、意大利语、西班牙语和葡萄牙语六种印欧语言的借词隔离任务中，模型表现超过基线方法，特别是在跨语言数据上显示出显著性能提升

Conclusion: 该无监督混合方法能够有效利用语言内部特征检测借词，为历史语言学研究提供了一种更可靠的方法

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for detecting loanwords i.e., words
borrowed from one language into another. While prior work has primarily relied
on language-external information to identify loanwords, such approaches can
introduce circularity and constraints into the historical linguistics workflow.
In contrast, our model relies solely on language-internal information to
process both native and borrowed words in monolingual and multilingual
wordlists. By extracting pertinent linguistic features, scoring them, and
mapping them probabilistically, we iteratively refine initial results by
identifying and generalizing from emerging patterns until convergence. This
hybrid approach leverages both linguistic and statistical cues to guide the
discovery process. We evaluate our method on the task of isolating loanwords in
datasets from six standard Indo-European languages: English, German, French,
Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese. Experimental results demonstrate that our
model outperforms baseline methods, with strong performance gains observed when
scaling to cross-linguistic data.

Motivation: 论证挖掘旨在从自然语言文本中自动提取论证结构和关系，但现有研究多针对单一任务。本文探索如何用单个大语言模型处理多个相关任务，以提高效率和性能。

Method: 1) 构建包含19个知名论证挖掘数据集的多任务统一格式数据集；2) 使用Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct模型，比较三种微调策略：单任务微调、多任务联合微调、以及分别微调后模型融合。

Result: 实验表明：单任务微调在所有任务上显著提升性能；多任务微调保持强劲性能且无退化，表明相关任务间存在有效迁移学习；模型融合策略在保持竞争力的同时降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: 单个大语言模型可以通过适当的微调策略有效处理多个论证挖掘任务，其中多任务微调和模型融合都是可行的解决方案，为相关NLP任务提供了实用的多任务处理框架。

Abstract: Argument mining is a subfield of argumentation that aims to automatically
extract argumentative structures and their relations from natural language
texts. This paper investigates how a single large language model can be
leveraged to perform one or several argument mining tasks. Our contributions
are two-fold. First, we construct a multi-task dataset by surveying and
converting 19 well-known argument mining datasets from the literature into a
unified format. Second, we explore various training strategies using Meta AI's
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model: (1) fine-tuning on individual tasks, (2)
fine-tuning jointly on multiple tasks, and (3) merging models fine-tuned
separately on individual tasks. Our experiments show that task-specific
fine-tuning significantly improves individual performance across all tasks.
Moreover, multi-task fine-tuning maintains strong performance without
degradation, suggesting effective transfer learning across related tasks.
Finally, we demonstrate that model merging offers a viable compromise: it
yields competitive performance while mitigating the computational costs
associated with full multi-task fine-tuning.

Motivation: 现有去偏技术（如SentDebias）在多语言场景下效果有限，直接应用于LLM表示时跨语言迁移能力不足

Method: 使用并行TED演讲脚本训练自编码器构建对齐的跨语言潜在空间，在该空间应用去偏技术

Result: 实验证明：1）自编码器能有效构建对齐的跨语言潜在空间；2）在潜在空间去偏显著提升整体去偏性能和跨语言迁移性

Conclusion: 在联合潜在空间进行去偏比直接在LLM表示上操作更有效，为多语言去偏提供了新思路

Abstract: Debiasing techniques such as SentDebias aim to reduce bias in large language
models (LLMs). Previous studies have evaluated their cross-lingual
transferability by directly applying these methods to LLM representations,
revealing their limited effectiveness across languages. In this work, we
therefore propose to perform debiasing in a joint latent space rather than
directly on LLM representations. We construct a well-aligned cross-lingual
latent space using an autoencoder trained on parallel TED talk scripts. Our
experiments with Aya-expanse and two debiasing techniques across four languages
(English, French, German, Dutch) demonstrate that a) autoencoders effectively
construct a well-aligned cross-lingual latent space, and b) applying debiasing
techniques in the learned cross-lingual latent space significantly improves
both the overall debiasing performance and cross-lingual transferability.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型如何有效组合子词表示形成有意义的词级表示，理解不同模型在子词信息组合方面的内在机制差异。

Method: 设计全面的实验集，从结构相似性、语义可分解性和形式保持性三个维度，分层分析五个不同LLM家族的子词组合模式。

Result: 发现LLM可分为三类不同组合策略组：(1)结构相似性演化呈现三种模式；(2)语义可分解性敏感度表现优异；(3)形式特征敏感度呈现三种不同模式。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM组合动态的重要见解，突显了不同模型在编码和整合子词信息时的不同组合模式，为理解LLM内部工作机制提供了宝贵信息。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) take sequences of subwords as input, requiring
them to effective compose subword representations into meaningful word-level
representations. In this paper, we present a comprehensive set of experiments
to probe how LLMs compose subword information, focusing on three key aspects:
structural similarity, semantic decomposability, and form retention. Our
analysis of the experiments suggests that these five LLM families can be
classified into three distinct groups, likely reflecting difference in their
underlying composition strategies. Specifically, we observe (i) three distinct
patterns in the evolution of structural similarity between subword compositions
and whole-word representations across layers; (ii) great performance when
probing layer by layer their sensitivity to semantic decompositionality; and
(iii) three distinct patterns when probing sensitivity to formal features,
e.g., character sequence length. These findings provide valuable insights into
the compositional dynamics of LLMs and highlight different compositional
pattens in how LLMs encode and integrate subword information.

Method: 基于社会科学的测量理论框架，作者识别并批判性评估了LLJs使用的四个核心假设：作为人类判断的代理、评估能力、可扩展性和成本效益。通过分析文本摘要、数据标注和安全对齐三个具体应用场景来验证这些假设。

Result: 研究发现LLJs的四个核心假设都存在挑战：作为人类判断代理的可靠性有限、评估能力受模型固有局限影响、可扩展性可能牺牲质量、成本效益分析不全面。当前实践可能高估了LLJs的有效性。

Conclusion: 需要更负责任的评估实践来确保LLJs在自然语言生成领域的发展能够真正支持而非阻碍进步。建议对LLJs进行更严格的可靠性验证，并建立更全面的评估框架。

Abstract: Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems remains a core challenge
of natural language processing (NLP), further complicated by the rise of large
language models (LLMs) that aims to be general-purpose. Recently, large
language models as judges (LLJs) have emerged as a promising alternative to
traditional metrics, but their validity remains underexplored. This position
paper argues that the current enthusiasm around LLJs may be premature, as their
adoption has outpaced rigorous scrutiny of their reliability and validity as
evaluators. Drawing on measurement theory from the social sciences, we identify
and critically assess four core assumptions underlying the use of LLJs: their
ability to act as proxies for human judgment, their capabilities as evaluators,
their scalability, and their cost-effectiveness. We examine how each of these
assumptions may be challenged by the inherent limitations of LLMs, LLJs, or
current practices in NLG evaluation. To ground our analysis, we explore three
applications of LLJs: text summarization, data annotation, and safety
alignment. Finally, we highlight the need for more responsible evaluation
practices in LLJs evaluation, to ensure that their growing role in the field
supports, rather than undermines, progress in NLG.

Motivation: 评估量化技术对AI模型偏见的影响，特别关注不同人口组的差异效应

Method: 使用概率和生成文本指标，在9个测试集上评估不同架构和推理能力的模型，重点分析权重和激活值量化策略

Result: 量化对偏见有细微影响：降低毒性、不影响情感指标，但稍增法定迷信和生成任务中的不公平性，尤其在高压缩条件下

Conclusion: 量化应用需谨慎考虑效率与道德问题的平衡，偏见影响在不同情境下有差异

Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of how quantization affects
model bias, with particular attention to its impact on individual demographic
subgroups. We focus on weight and activation quantization strategies and
examine their effects across a broad range of bias types, including
stereotypes, toxicity, sentiment, and fairness. We employ both probabilistic
and generated text-based metrics across nine benchmarks and evaluate models
varying in architecture family and reasoning ability. Our findings show that
quantization has a nuanced impact on bias: while it can reduce model toxicity
and does not significantly impact sentiment, it tends to slightly increase
stereotypes and unfairness in generative tasks, especially under aggressive
compression. These trends are generally consistent across demographic
categories and model types, although their magnitude depends on the specific
setting. Overall, our results highlight the importance of carefully balancing
efficiency and ethical considerations when applying quantization in practice.

Abstract: Depression commonly co-occurs with neurodegenerative disorders like Multiple
Sclerosis (MS), yet the potential of speech-based Artificial Intelligence for
detecting depression in such contexts remains unexplored. This study examines
the transferability of speech-based depression detection methods to people with
MS (pwMS) through cross-corpus and cross-lingual analysis using English data
from the general population and German data from pwMS. Our approach implements
supervised machine learning models using: 1) conventional speech and language
features commonly used in the field, 2) emotional dimensions derived from a
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) model, and 3) exploratory speech feature
analysis. Despite limited data, our models detect depressive mood in pwMS with
moderate generalisability, achieving a 66% Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) on a
binary task. Feature selection further improved performance, boosting UAR to
74%. Our findings also highlight the relevant role emotional changes have as an
indicator of depressive mood in both the general population and within PwMS.
This study provides an initial exploration into generalising speech-based
depression detection, even in the presence of co-occurring conditions, such as
neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: We present a case study evaluating large language models (LLMs) with
128K-token context windows on a technical question answering (QA) task. Our
benchmark is built on a user manual for an agricultural machine, available in
English, French, and German. It simulates a cross-lingual information retrieval
scenario where questions are posed in English against all three language
versions of the manual. The evaluation focuses on realistic
"needle-in-a-haystack" challenges and includes unanswerable questions to test
for hallucinations. We compare nine long-context LLMs using direct prompting
against three Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategies (keyword,
semantic, hybrid), with an LLM-as-a-judge for evaluation. Our findings for this
specific manual show that Hybrid RAG consistently outperforms direct
long-context prompting. Models like Gemini 2.5 Flash and the smaller Qwen 2.5
7B achieve high accuracy (over 85%) across all languages with RAG. This paper
contributes a detailed analysis of LLM performance in a specialized industrial
domain and an open framework for similar evaluations, highlighting practical
trade-offs and challenges.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了检测LLM规划行为的因果标准和方法，发现在代码生成和诗歌创作任务中，不同模型表现出不同的规划策略，规划行为并非普遍存在，指令微调会优化而非创建规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究假设固定的规划视野且局限于单一领域，需要区分LLM的规划与即兴生成行为，建立可复现的检测方法。

Method: 提出了形式化和因果基础的规划检测标准，开发半自动化标注流程，在Gemma-2-2B模型上测试MBPP代码生成和诗歌生成任务。

Result: 发现规划行为并非普遍：Gemma-2-2B在诗歌生成中采用即兴策略，在代码生成中混合使用规划和即兴策略，指令微调优化而非创建规划能力。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM规划机制的机理研究提供了可复现和可扩展的基础，揭示了不同模型和任务中规划行为的差异性。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
across a wide range of multi-step reasoning tasks. Recent work suggests that
LLMs may perform planning - selecting a future target token in advance and
generating intermediate tokens that lead towards it - rather than merely
improvising one token at a time. However, existing studies assume fixed
planning horizons and often focus on single prompts or narrow domains. To
distinguish planning from improvisation across models and tasks, we present
formal and causally grounded criteria for detecting planning and operationalize
them as a semi-automated annotation pipeline. We apply this pipeline to both
base and instruction-tuned Gemma-2-2B models on the MBPP code generation
benchmark and a poem generation task where Claude 3.5 Haiku was previously
shown to plan. Our findings show that planning is not universal: unlike Haiku,
Gemma-2-2B solves the same poem generation task through improvisation, and on
MBPP it switches between planning and improvisation across similar tasks and
even successive token predictions. We further show that instruction tuning
refines existing planning behaviors in the base model rather than creating them
from scratch. Together, these studies provide a reproducible and scalable
foundation for mechanistic studies of planning in LLMs.

Motivation: 随着社交媒体多模态内容的普及，现有情感分析方法在处理异构数据和识别多标签情感方面存在不足，缺乏有效的跨模态融合和外部知识整合。

Method: 提出SentiMM多智能体框架，包含专门处理文本和视觉输入的智能体，进行多模态特征融合，通过知识检索丰富上下文信息，最后聚合结果进行情感分类。同时构建了SentiMMD大规模多模态数据集。

Result: 大量实验表明，SentiMM相比最先进的基线方法取得了优越的性能，验证了该结构化方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SentiMM框架通过系统化的多智能体设计和知识增强，有效解决了多模态情感分析中的关键挑战，为相关研究提供了新的解决方案和基准数据集。

Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of multimodal content on social media,
sentiment analysis faces significant challenges in effectively processing
heterogeneous data and recognizing multi-label emotions. Existing methods often
lack effective cross-modal fusion and external knowledge integration. We
propose SentiMM, a novel multi-agent framework designed to systematically
address these challenges. SentiMM processes text and visual inputs through
specialized agents, fuses multimodal features, enriches context via knowledge
retrieval, and aggregates results for final sentiment classification. We also
introduce SentiMMD, a large-scale multimodal dataset with seven fine-grained
sentiment categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SentiMM achieves
superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, validating the
effectiveness of our structured approach.

Motivation: 随着普林斯顿WordNet在自然语言处理中重要性增加，对其本地化和质量保证的需求日益关键。现有工作规模有限且缺乏严谨性，缺乏关于本地化准确性及其与阿拉伯文化背景对齐的研究

Method: 提出了一个结构化框架，详细说明了实现高质量本地化所需的阶段和程序，在不损害文化真实性的前提下完成本地化

Result: 报告了应用该框架的经验，成功完成了10,000个同义词集的本地化工作

Conclusion: 该研究为WordNet的本地化提供了一个系统性的方法框架，解决了现有工作的局限性，确保了文化适应性和质量

Abstract: As Princeton WordNet continues to gain significance as a semantic lexicon in
Natural Language Processing, the need for its localization and for ensuring the
quality of this process has become increasingly critical. Existing efforts
remain limited in both scale and rigor, and there is a notable absence of
studies addressing the accuracy of localization or its alignment with the
cultural context of Arabic. This paper proposes a structured framework for the
localization of Princeton WordNet, detailing the stages and procedures required
to achieve high-quality results without compromising cultural authenticity. We
further present our experience in applying this framework, reporting outcomes
from the localization of 10,000 synsets.

*Jianxiang Zang,Nijia Mo,Yonda Wei,Meiling Ning,Hui Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: S²Sent提出了一种句子表示选择机制，通过空间选择和嵌套频率选择来优化Transformer编码器中不同块的表示融合，在保持低参数和延迟的同时显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于Transformer编码器和对比学习的主流句子表示学习方法通常只使用最后一层的隐藏状态，但不同Transformer块具有不同的语义感知能力，需要合理的跨块表示融合来优化。

Method: 提出S²Sent机制，在Transformer编码器下游集成参数化嵌套选择器，包含空间选择(SS)和嵌套频率选择(FS)。SS使用基于空间压缩的自门控机制获得自适应权重，FS用不同DCT基函数替代GAP实现低语义损失的空间压缩。

Result: 大量实验表明S²Sent在基线方法基础上取得显著改进，仅增加可忽略的额外参数和推理延迟，同时具有高集成性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: S²Sent通过创新的跨块表示融合机制有效平衡了语义冗余和损失，为句子表示学习提供了有效的优化方向。

Abstract: The combination of Transformer-based encoders with contrastive learning
represents the current mainstream paradigm for sentence representation
learning. This paradigm is typically based on the hidden states of the last
Transformer block of the encoder. However, within Transformer-based encoders,
different blocks exhibit varying degrees of semantic perception ability. From
the perspective of interpretability, the semantic perception potential of
knowledge neurons is modulated by stimuli, thus rational cross-block
representation fusion is a direction worth optimizing. To balance the semantic
redundancy and loss across block fusion, we propose a sentence representation
selection mechanism S\textsuperscript{2}Sent, which integrates a parameterized
nested selector downstream of the Transformer-based encoder. This selector
performs spatial selection (SS) and nested frequency selection (FS) from a
modular perspective. The SS innovatively employs a spatial squeeze based
self-gating mechanism to obtain adaptive weights, which not only achieves
fusion with low information redundancy but also captures the dependencies
between embedding features. The nested FS replaces GAP with different DCT basis
functions to achieve spatial squeeze with low semantic loss. Extensive
experiments have demonstrated that S\textsuperscript{2}Sent achieves
significant improvements over baseline methods with negligible additional
parameters and inference latency, while highlighting high integrability and
scalability.

TL;DR: 提出了DiscussLLM框架，通过训练LLM主动决定何时发言而不仅仅是说什么，来解决LLM在对话中的被动性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM主要作为被动响应代理，只在被直接提示时回应，这种被动性造成了"意识差距"，限制了它们作为动态人类讨论中真正协作伙伴的潜力。

Method: 采用两阶段数据生成管道合成大规模多轮人类讨论数据集，标注五种干预类型和明确的对话触发点。训练模型预测特殊静默令牌来学习保持沉默直到需要有用贡献时。探索了端到端模型和解耦分类器-生成器系统两种架构。

Result: 模型学会了准确判断干预时机并生成有帮助的响应，为更具情境意识和主动性的对话AI铺平了道路。

Conclusion: DiscussLLM框架成功解决了LLM的被动性问题，通过训练模型主动决定发言时机，实现了更自然和协作的人机对话体验。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
understanding and generating human-like text, yet they largely operate as
reactive agents, responding only when directly prompted. This passivity creates
an "awareness gap," limiting their potential as truly collaborative partners in
dynamic human discussions. We introduce $\textit{DiscussLLM}$, a framework
designed to bridge this gap by training models to proactively decide not just
$\textit{what}$ to say, but critically, $\textit{when}$ to speak. Our primary
contribution is a scalable two-stage data generation pipeline that synthesizes
a large-scale dataset of realistic multi-turn human discussions. Each
discussion is annotated with one of five intervention types (e.g., Factual
Correction, Concept Definition) and contains an explicit conversational trigger
where an AI intervention adds value. By training models to predict a special
silent token when no intervention is needed, they learn to remain quiet until a
helpful contribution can be made. We explore two architectural baselines: an
integrated end-to-end model and a decoupled classifier-generator system
optimized for low-latency inference. We evaluate these models on their ability
to accurately time interventions and generate helpful responses, paving the way
for more situationally aware and proactive conversational AI.

Motivation: 传统RAG模型端到端优化面临离散隐变量边缘化的挑战，现有的top-K边缘化和变分RAG方法存在梯度估计偏差或高方差问题

Method: 提出基于联合随机近似(JSA)算法的端到端RAG训练方法JSA-RAG，这是EM算法的随机扩展，特别适用于离散隐变量模型估计

Result: 在5个数据集上的实验表明，JSA-RAG在开放域问答和知识对话两个任务上显著优于传统RAG和VRAG方法

Conclusion: JSA-RAG在生成、检索和低方差梯度估计方面表现出色，为解决RAG模型端到端训练问题提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely recognized paradigm
to combine parametric memory with non-parametric memories. An RAG model
consists of two serial connecting components (retriever and generator). A major
challenge in end-to-end optimization of the RAG model is that marginalization
over relevant passages (modeled as discrete latent variables) from a knowledge
base is required. Traditional top-K marginalization and variational RAG (VRAG)
suffer from biased or high-variance gradient estimates. In this paper, we
propose and develop joint stochastic approximation (JSA) based end-to-end
training of RAG, which is referred to as JSA-RAG. The JSA algorithm is a
stochastic extension of the EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm and is
particularly powerful in estimating discrete latent variable models. Extensive
experiments are conducted on five datasets for two tasks (open-domain question
answering, knowledge-grounded dialogs) and show that JSA-RAG significantly
outperforms both vanilla RAG and VRAG. Further analysis shows the efficacy of
JSA-RAG from the perspectives of generation, retrieval, and low-variance
gradient estimate.

TL;DR: AulSign是一种利用大语言模型进行手语翻译的新方法，通过动态提示和上下文学习来解决数据稀缺问题，在低数据场景下表现优于现有最先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手语翻译面临数据稀缺的挑战，现有平行语料库有限且缺乏标准化，难以捕捉手语的完整语言丰富性，需要开发在数据稀缺环境下仍能有效工作的翻译系统。

Method: 提出AulSign方法，利用大语言模型通过动态提示和上下文学习进行样本选择和后续手语关联。将手语与自然语言的紧凑描述相关联，指导模型使用这些描述进行翻译。

Result: 在英语和意大利语上使用SignBank+和LaCAM CNR-ISTC数据集进行评估，在低数据场景下表现出优于最先进模型的性能。

Conclusion: AulSign方法有效解决了手语翻译中的数据稀缺问题，有潜力提升 underrepresented 语言社区在通信技术中的可访问性和包容性。

Abstract: Translating natural languages into sign languages is a highly complex and
underexplored task. Despite growing interest in accessibility and inclusivity,
the development of robust translation systems remains hindered by the limited
availability of parallel corpora which align natural language with sign
language data. Existing methods often struggle to generalize in these
data-scarce environments, as the few datasets available are typically
domain-specific, lack standardization, or fail to capture the full linguistic
richness of sign languages. To address this limitation, we propose Advanced Use
of LLMs for Sign Language Translation (AulSign), a novel method that leverages
Large Language Models via dynamic prompting and in-context learning with sample
selection and subsequent sign association. Despite their impressive abilities
in processing text, LLMs lack intrinsic knowledge of sign languages; therefore,
they are unable to natively perform this kind of translation. To overcome this
limitation, we associate the signs with compact descriptions in natural
language and instruct the model to use them. We evaluate our method on both
English and Italian languages using SignBank+, a recognized benchmark in the
field, as well as the Italian LaCAM CNR-ISTC dataset. We demonstrate superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art models in low-data scenario. Our
findings demonstrate the effectiveness of AulSign, with the potential to
enhance accessibility and inclusivity in communication technologies for
underrepresented linguistic communities.

TL;DR: 通过语言分析识别个人音乐偏好，基于大五人格特质作为中介


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音乐偏好与个人身份密切相关，而人格特质可通过语言分析识别，研究尝试将这两个领域结合，通过语言来预测音乐偏好

Method: 使用500,000份文本样本和5,000名作者的数据集，建立高级模型评估大五人格特质

Result: 发现不同音乐流派的粉丝在人格特质上存在显著差异

Conclusion: 证明了通过语言分析可以识别音乐偏好，为计算语言学、音乐心理学和人格分析的交叉研究提供了资源

Abstract: Music serves as a powerful reflection of individual identity, often aligning
with deeper psychological traits. Prior research has established correlations
between musical preferences and personality traits, while separate studies have
demonstrated that personality is detectable through linguistic analysis. Our
study bridges these two research domains by investigating whether individuals'
musical preferences are recognizable in their spontaneous language through the
lens of the Big Five personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness,
Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism). Using a carefully curated
dataset of over 500,000 text samples from nearly 5,000 authors with reliably
identified musical preferences, we build advanced models to assess personality
characteristics. Our results reveal significant personality differences across
fans of five musical genres. We release resources for future research at the
intersection of computational linguistics, music psychology and personality
analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联络中心对话具有目标导向、角色不对称和行为复杂性等特点，但隐私和数据稀缺限制了模型训练和评估。现有开放域或医疗对话生成方法不适用于联络中心场景。

Method: 利用意图摘要、话题流程和QA评估表等现有监督信号指导生成，提出包含18个语言和行为指标的诊断框架，比较了四种语言无关的生成策略。

Result: 结果显示所有方法都存在挑战，没有一种方法在所有特征上都表现优异，特别是在不流畅性、情感和行为真实性方面存在明显缺陷。

Conclusion: 提出的诊断工具能够暴露合成对话的差距，支持跨语言的细粒度评估和压力测试，为联络中心合成对话生成提供了有效的评估框架。

Abstract: Synthetic transcript generation is critical in contact center domains, where
privacy and data scarcity limit model training and evaluation. Unlike prior
synthetic dialogue generation work on open-domain or medical dialogues, contact
center conversations are goal-oriented, role-asymmetric, and behaviorally
complex, featuring disfluencies, ASR noise, and compliance-driven agent
actions. In deployments where transcripts are unavailable, standard pipelines
still yield derived call attributes such as Intent Summaries, Topic Flow, and
QA Evaluation Forms. We leverage these as supervision signals to guide
generation. To assess the quality of such outputs, we introduce a diagnostic
framework of 18 linguistically and behaviorally grounded metrics for comparing
real and synthetic transcripts. We benchmark four language-agnostic generation
strategies, from simple prompting to characteristic-aware multi-stage
approaches, alongside reference-free baselines. Results reveal persistent
challenges: no method excels across all traits, with notable deficits in
disfluency, sentiment, and behavioral realism. Our diagnostic tool exposes
these gaps, enabling fine-grained evaluation and stress testing of synthetic
dialogue across languages.

TL;DR: 论文提出ESFP-RM奖励模型框架，通过将AI反馈强化学习中的奖励建模重新定义为自然语言推理任务，利用带上下文解释的掩码语言模型在槽位预测上的优势，实现了比生成式奖励模型更稳定和可泛化的奖励信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于语言模型的生成式奖励模型虽然使AI反馈强化学习(RLAIF)变得高效和可扩展，但作者发现奖励建模与自然语言推理(NLI)任务存在形式一致性，希望通过扩展模型理解边界来构建更优的奖励模型。

Method: 提出ESFP-RM两阶段奖励模型：首先通过探索性实验证明带上下文解释的掩码语言模型(MLMs)在NLI任务上优于自回归模型；然后基于此构建基于解释的槽位预测框架奖励模型。

Result: 大量实验表明，在人类反馈强化学习(RLHF)和分布外(OOD)场景中，ESFP-RM框架相比生成式奖励模型能提供更稳定和可泛化的奖励信号。

Conclusion: 将奖励建模重新定义为NLI任务，并利用MLMs在槽位预测上的优势，可以构建出性能更优的奖励模型，为RLAIF范式的发展提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: The emergence of LM-based judging reward modeling, represented by generative
reward models, has successfully made reinforcement learning from AI feedback
(RLAIF) efficient and scalable. To further advance this paradigm, we propose a
core insight: this form of reward modeling shares fundamental formal
consistency with natural language inference (NLI), a core task in natural
language understanding. This reframed perspective points to a key path for
building superior reward models: scaling the model's comprehension boundaries.
Pursuing this path, exploratory experiments on NLI tasks demonstrate that the
slot prediction masked language models (MLMs) incorporating contextual
explanations achieve significantly better performance compared to mainstream
autoregressive models. Based on this key finding, we propose ESFP-RM, a
two-stage LM-based judging reward model that utilizes an explanation based slot
framework for prediction to fully leverage the advantages of MLMs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that in both reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF) and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, the ESFP-RM framework delivers
more stable and generalizable reward signals compared to generative reward
models.

TL;DR: 提出了MTalk-Bench多轮语音对话评测基准，包含语义、副语言和环境声音三个维度，采用竞技场式和评分表式双评估方法，发现当前语音模型在副语言和环境声音处理方面存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音到语音大模型的评估框架不足以评估复杂多轮对话的性能，需要更全面的评测标准。

Method: 构建MTalk-Bench多轮S2S基准，涵盖三个核心维度（语义信息、副语言信息、环境声音），每个维度包含9个现实场景，采用竞技场式评估（成对比较）和评分表式评估（绝对评分）双方法。

Result: 模型在语义信息处理表现优秀，但在副语言信息和环境声音感知方面表现不佳；模型通过增加响应长度来恢复连贯性，但牺牲了多轮对话效率；模态感知的任务特定设计优于简单扩展规模。

Conclusion: 当前S2S评估存在局限性，需要更鲁棒、语音感知的评估框架，LLM作为评估者与人类评估者在差距明显或标准明确时一致，但存在位置和长度偏差。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech-to-speech (S2S) large language models (LLMs)
has significantly improved real-time spoken interaction. However, current
evaluation frameworks remain inadequate for assessing performance in complex,
multi-turn dialogues. To address this, we introduce MTalk-Bench, a multi-turn
S2S benchmark covering three core dimensions: Semantic Information,
Paralinguistic Information, and Ambient Sound. Each dimension includes nine
realistic scenarios, along with targeted tasks to assess specific capabilities
such as reasoning. Our dual-method evaluation framework combines Arena-style
evaluation (pairwise comparison) and Rubrics-based evaluation (absolute
scoring) for relative and absolute assessment. The benchmark includes both
model and human outputs, evaluated by human evaluators and LLMs. Experimental
results reveal two sets of findings. Overall performance of S2S LLMs: (1)
models excel at semantic information processing yet underperform on
paralinguistic information and ambient sounds perception; (2) models typically
regain coherence by increasing response length, sacrificing efficiency in
multi-turn dialogues; (3) modality-aware, task-specific designs outperform
brute scaling. Evaluation framework and reliability: (1) Arena and Rubrics
yield consistent, complementary rankings, but reliable distinctions emerge only
when performance gaps are large; (2) LLM-as-a-judge aligns with humans when
gaps are clear or criteria explicit, but exhibits position and length biases
and is reliable on nonverbal evaluation only with text annotations. These
results highlight current limitations in S2S evaluation and the need for more
robust, speech-aware assessment frameworks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探索不同大语言模型在检测社交媒体性别歧视内容方面的能力，使用EXIST 2024数据集分析模型能否模拟不同人口群体的感知，并发现模型虽然能一定程度上检测性别歧视，但无法准确复制不同人群的多样性观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在自动检测性别歧视方面显示出潜力，但现有研究表明这些模型存在偏见，特别是对少数群体的偏见。由于性别歧视检测的主观性和自动化模型中的偏见，这项任务仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 使用EXIST 2024推特数据集，该数据集包含每条推文的六个不同人口统计特征的标注，评估不同LLMs模拟这些群体在性别歧视检测中感知的能力，并进行统计分析以确定哪些人口特征（年龄、性别）对此任务最有效。

Result: 结果显示，虽然LLMs在考虑总体意见时能够一定程度上检测性别歧视，但它们无法准确复制不同人口群体之间的感知多样性。模型存在人口统计偏见。

Conclusion: 需要开发更好的校准模型，以考虑不同人群的视角多样性，提高性别歧视检测的准确性和公平性。

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) has proven to be a tool that could
help in the automatic detection of sexism. Previous studies have shown that
these models contain biases that do not accurately reflect reality, especially
for minority groups. Despite various efforts to improve the detection of sexist
content, this task remains a significant challenge due to its subjective nature
and the biases present in automated models. We explore the capabilities of
different LLMs to detect sexism in social media text using the EXIST 2024 tweet
dataset. It includes annotations from six distinct profiles for each tweet,
allowing us to evaluate to what extent LLMs can mimic these groups' perceptions
in sexism detection. Additionally, we analyze the demographic biases present in
the models and conduct a statistical analysis to identify which demographic
characteristics (age, gender) contribute most effectively to this task. Our
results show that, while LLMs can to some extent detect sexism when considering
the overall opinion of populations, they do not accurately replicate the
diversity of perceptions among different demographic groups. This highlights
the need for better-calibrated models that account for the diversity of
perspectives across different populations.

TL;DR: 评估大语言模型对中文量词预测能力的研究，发现LLMs表现不如BERT模型，双向注意力机制对量词预测有重要优势


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中文量词是汉语的重要特征，正确预测量词对教育应用至关重要，但主流大语言模型是否具备正确的中文量词知识尚未在NLP文献中得到充分探索

Method: 采用多种掩码策略评估LLMs的内在能力，分析不同句子元素的贡献，研究注意力机制在预测过程中的作用，并探索通过微调提升量词性能

Result: 研究发现LLMs的表现比BERT更差，即使经过微调也是如此。预测过程极大地受益于后续名词的信息，这也解释了具有双向注意力机制的模型（如BERT）的优势

Conclusion: 大语言模型在中文量词预测方面存在不足，双向注意力机制对于此类语言特征的处理具有显著优势，需要进一步改进模型架构来提升中文语言特性的处理能力

Abstract: Classifiers are an important and defining feature of the Chinese language,
and their correct prediction is key to numerous educational applications. Yet,
whether the most popular Large Language Models (LLMs) possess proper knowledge
the Chinese classifiers is an issue that has largely remain unexplored in the
Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature.
  To address such a question, we employ various masking strategies to evaluate
the LLMs' intrinsic ability, the contribution of different sentence elements,
and the working of the attention mechanisms during prediction. Besides, we
explore fine-tuning for LLMs to enhance the classifier performance.
  Our findings reveal that LLMs perform worse than BERT, even with fine-tuning.
The prediction, as expected, greatly benefits from the information about the
following noun, which also explains the advantage of models with a
bidirectional attention mechanism such as BERT.

Motivation: 现有方法如search-o1在医疗问答任务中存在单一线性的推理链和扁平化的文本信息处理方式，导致错误累积和准确性不足，无法满足医疗领域对准确性和可追溯性的严格要求。

Method: MIRAGE框架包含四个核心步骤：1)将复杂查询分解为基于实体的子问题；2)执行并行推理链；3)通过邻居扩展和多跳遍历自适应检索证据；4)使用跨链验证整合答案以解决矛盾。

Result: 在三个医疗QA基准测试（GenMedGPT-5k、CMCQA和ExplainCPE）上，MIRAGE在自动和人工评估中均 consistently优于GPT-4o、Tree-of-Thought变体和其他检索增强基线方法。

Conclusion: MIRAGE通过结构化知识图谱上的动态多链推理，显著提升了医疗问答的准确性和可解释性，生成的显式推理链能够将事实主张追溯到知识图谱中的具体链，非常适合复杂的医疗推理场景。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown significant progress in test-time
scaling through chain-of-thought prompting. Current approaches like search-o1
integrate retrieval augmented generation (RAG) into multi-step reasoning
processes but rely on a single, linear reasoning chain while incorporating
unstructured textual information in a flat, context-agnostic manner. As a
result, these approaches can lead to error accumulation throughout the
reasoning chain, which significantly limits its effectiveness in medical
question-answering (QA) tasks where both accuracy and traceability are critical
requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MIRAGE (Multi-chain
Inference with Retrieval-Augmented Graph Exploration), a novel test-time
scalable reasoning framework that performs dynamic multi-chain inference over
structured medical knowledge graphs. Specifically, MIRAGE 1) decomposes complex
queries into entity-grounded sub-questions, 2) executes parallel inference
chains, 3) retrieves evidence adaptively via neighbor expansion and multi-hop
traversal, and 4) integrates answers using cross-chain verification to resolve
contradictions. Experiments on three medical QA benchmarks (GenMedGPT-5k,
CMCQA, and ExplainCPE) show that MIRAGE consistently outperforms GPT-4o,
Tree-of-Thought variants, and other retrieval-augmented baselines in both
automatic and human evaluations. Additionally, MIRAGE improves interpretability
by generating explicit reasoning chains that trace each factual claim to
concrete chains within the knowledge graph, making it well-suited for complex
medical reasoning scenarios. The code will be available for further research.

### [114] [Towards High-Precision Depth Sensing via Monocular-Aided iToF and RGB Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16579)
*Yansong Du,Yutong Deng,Yuting Zhou,Feiyu Jiao,Jian Song,Xun Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的iToF-RGB融合框架，通过几何校准和双编码器网络解决iToF深度传感的低分辨率、窄视场和结构失真问题，实现深度超分辨率和视场扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 间接飞行时间(iToF)深度传感存在空间分辨率低、视场角窄、复杂场景中结构失真等固有局限性，需要与RGB图像融合来提升性能。

Method: 首先通过精确几何校准将窄视场iToF深度图重投影到宽视场RGB坐标系，然后使用双编码器融合网络联合提取iToF深度和RGB图像的互补特征，在单目深度先验指导下恢复精细结构细节并进行深度超分辨率。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在准确性、结构一致性和视觉质量方面显著优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该iToF-RGB融合框架通过跨模态结构线索和深度一致性约束，成功实现了增强的深度准确性、改进的边缘锐度和无缝的视场扩展。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel iToF-RGB fusion framework designed to address the
inherent limitations of indirect Time-of-Flight (iToF) depth sensing, such as
low spatial resolution, limited field-of-view (FoV), and structural distortion
in complex scenes. The proposed method first reprojects the narrow-FoV iToF
depth map onto the wide-FoV RGB coordinate system through a precise geometric
calibration and alignment module, ensuring pixel-level correspondence between
modalities. A dual-encoder fusion network is then employed to jointly extract
complementary features from the reprojected iToF depth and RGB image, guided by
monocular depth priors to recover fine-grained structural details and perform
depth super-resolution. By integrating cross-modal structural cues and depth
consistency constraints, our approach achieves enhanced depth accuracy,
improved edge sharpness, and seamless FoV expansion. Extensive experiments on
both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy,
structural consistency, and visual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountLoop是一个无需训练的训练框架，通过迭代结构化反馈为扩散模型提供精确的实例控制，在复杂高密度场景中实现高达98%的计数准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在逼真图像合成方面表现出色，但在生成具有精确对象实例数量的场景时仍不可靠，特别是在复杂和高密度设置中。

Method: 采用训练免费框架，交替进行图像生成和多模态代理评估，包括语言引导的规划器和评论器来评估对象数量、空间布局和属性一致性，并引入实例驱动的注意力掩码和组合生成技术。

Result: 在COCO Count、T2I CompBench和两个新的高实例基准测试中，CountLoop实现了高达98%的计数准确性，同时保持空间保真度和视觉质量，得分0.97，优于基于布局和梯度引导的基线方法。

Conclusion: CountLoop通过迭代反馈机制有效解决了扩散模型在精确实例控制方面的局限性，为复杂场景生成提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable progress in photorealistic image
synthesis, yet they remain unreliable for generating scenes with a precise
number of object instances, particularly in complex and high-density settings.
We present CountLoop, a training-free framework that provides diffusion models
with accurate instance control through iterative structured feedback. The
approach alternates between image generation and multimodal agent evaluation,
where a language-guided planner and critic assess object counts, spatial
arrangements, and attribute consistency. This feedback is then used to refine
layouts and guide subsequent generations. To further improve separation between
objects, especially in occluded scenes, we introduce instance-driven attention
masking and compositional generation techniques. Experiments on COCO Count, T2I
CompBench, and two new high-instance benchmarks show that CountLoop achieves
counting accuracy of up to 98% while maintaining spatial fidelity and visual
quality, outperforming layout-based and gradient-guided baselines with a score
of 0.97.

TL;DR: 研究发现CLIP视觉编码器中MLP层的神经元存在特征叠加现象，这直接阻碍了组合特征表示能力，导致视觉语言模型在组合推理和对象绑定方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在图像描述和视觉问答等任务中表现出色，但在组合泛化和对象绑定方面存在困难，限制了处理新对象属性组合的能力。

Method: 使用机制可解释性技术分析CLIP视觉编码器，发现MLP层中单个神经元代表多个特征的"叠加"现象。

Result: 证明了特征叠加现象直接阻碍了组合特征表示，从而影响了组合推理和对象绑定能力。

Conclusion: 这项研究为揭示视觉语言模型中组合失败机制根源迈出了第一步，相关代码和结果已开源。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
integrating visual and textual information for tasks such as image captioning
and visual question answering. However, these models struggle with
compositional generalization and object binding, which limit their ability to
handle novel combinations of objects and their attributes. Our work explores
the root causes of these failures using mechanistic interpretability
techniques. We show evidence that individual neurons in the MLP layers of
CLIP's vision encoder represent multiple features, and this "superposition"
directly hinders its compositional feature representation which consequently
affects compositional reasoning and object binding capabilities. We hope this
study will serve as an initial step toward uncovering the mechanistic roots of
compositional failures in VLMs. The code and supporting results can be found

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSNav是一个用于视觉语言导航的创新框架，通过集成记忆、空间和决策三个模块，解决了传统LLM方法在空间推理、跨模态基础和长时记忆方面的缺陷，在R2R和REVERIE数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于单一大型语言模型的视觉语言导航方法存在空间推理能力差、跨模态基础薄弱和长时任务内存过载等关键漏洞，需要系统性地解决这些问题。

Method: 提出MSNav框架，包含三个协同模块：1）记忆模块-通过选择性节点剪枝的动态地图内存；2）空间模块-用于空间推理和对象关系推断；3）决策模块-基于LLM的路径规划。还开发了I-O-S数据集并微调Qwen3-4B模型为Qwen-Spatial。

Result: 在Room-to-Room和REVERIE数据集上的广泛实验表明，MSNav在成功率和路径长度加权成功率方面取得了显著改进，达到了最先进的性能。Qwen-Spatial在对象列表提取方面优于领先的商业LLM，在I-O-S测试集上获得更高的F1和NDCG分数。

Conclusion: MSNav通过模块化架构将脆弱的推理转化为稳健的集成智能，有效解决了视觉语言导航中的关键挑战，为多模态导航系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to interpret natural
language instructions and navigate complex environments. Current approaches
often adopt a "black-box" paradigm, where a single Large Language Model (LLM)
makes end-to-end decisions. However, it is plagued by critical vulnerabilities,
including poor spatial reasoning, weak cross-modal grounding, and memory
overload in long-horizon tasks. To systematically address these issues, we
propose Memory Spatial Navigation(MSNav), a framework that fuses three modules
into a synergistic architecture, which transforms fragile inference into a
robust, integrated intelligence. MSNav integrates three modules: Memory Module,
a dynamic map memory module that tackles memory overload through selective node
pruning, enhancing long-range exploration; Spatial Module, a module for spatial
reasoning and object relationship inference that improves endpoint recognition;
and Decision Module, a module using LLM-based path planning to execute robust
actions. Powering Spatial Module, we also introduce an Instruction-Object-Space
(I-O-S) dataset and fine-tune the Qwen3-4B model into Qwen-Spatial (Qwen-Sp),
which outperforms leading commercial LLMs in object list extraction, achieving
higher F1 and NDCG scores on the I-O-S test set. Extensive experiments on the
Room-to-Room (R2R) and REVERIE datasets demonstrate MSNav's state-of-the-art
performance with significant improvements in Success Rate (SR) and Success
weighted by Path Length (SPL).

Abstract: Classifying soil images contributes to better land management, increased
agricultural output, and practical solutions for environmental issues. The
development of various disciplines, particularly agriculture, civil
engineering, and natural resource management, is aided by understanding of soil
quality since it helps with risk reduction, performance improvement, and sound

Convolutional Neural Networks to classify soil kinds, and machine learning
algorithms were used to enhance the performance of soil classification . To
achieve better implementation and performance of the Convolutional Neural
Networks algorithm and obtain valuable results for the process of classifying
soil type images, swarm algorithms were employed to obtain the best performance
by choosing Hyper parameters for the Convolutional Neural Networks network

of multiple classification of soil types. The Accuracy and F1 measures were
adopted to test the system, and the results of the proposed work were efficient

Motivation: 传统增材制造质量评估依赖人工专家，现有机器学习方法缺乏可解释性，限制了在实际应用中的信任和采用

Method: 开发QA-VLM框架，整合视觉语言模型的注意力机制和推理能力，并从同行评审期刊文章中提取应用特定知识

Result: 在24个激光线材直接能量沉积单珠样本上评估，相比现成VLM模型，在解释质量方面展现出更高的有效性和一致性

Abstract: Image-based quality assessment (QA) in additive manufacturing (AM) often
relies heavily on the expertise and constant attention of skilled human
operators. While machine learning and deep learning methods have been
introduced to assist in this task, they typically provide black-box outputs
without interpretable justifications, limiting their trust and adoption in
real-world settings. In this work, we introduce a novel QA-VLM framework that
leverages the attention mechanisms and reasoning capabilities of
vision-language models (VLMs), enriched with application-specific knowledge
distilled from peer-reviewed journal articles, to generate human-interpretable
quality assessments. Evaluated on 24 single-bead samples produced by laser wire
direct energy deposition (DED-LW), our framework demonstrates higher validity
and consistency in explanation quality than off-the-shelf VLMs. These results
highlight the potential of our approach to enable trustworthy, interpretable
quality assessment in AM applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细粒度视觉分类需要识别细微局部特征，但现有Vision Transformer缺乏可解释性，在生物多样性监测和医疗诊断等关键应用中难以获得信任

Method: 设计轻量级即插即用注意力模块，使用复合损失函数端到端训练，隐式引导模型关注最具判别性的物体部位，无需显式部件级标注

Result: 在CUB-200-2011数据集上，将Swin-Base模型准确率从85.40%提升至88.06%，显著提升2.66%，注意力图能有效定位语义有意义的特征

Conclusion: 简单内在注意力机制可作为强大正则化器，显著提升性能的同时提供清晰可视化解释，为理解和信任模型决策提供有价值工具

Abstract: Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) is a critical and challenging area
within computer vision, demanding the identification of highly subtle,
localized visual cues. The importance of FGVC extends to critical applications
such as biodiversity monitoring and medical diagnostics, where precision is
paramount. While large-scale Vision Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art
performance, their decision-making processes often lack the interpretability
required for trust and verification in such domains. In this paper, we
introduce The Loupe, a novel, lightweight, and plug-and-play attention module
designed to be inserted into pre-trained backbones like the Swin Transformer.
The Loupe is trained end-to-end with a composite loss function that implicitly
guides the model to focus on the most discriminative object parts without
requiring explicit part-level annotations. Our unique contribution lies in
demonstrating that a simple, intrinsic attention mechanism can act as a
powerful regularizer, significantly boosting performance while simultaneously
providing clear visual explanations. Our experimental evaluation on the
challenging CUB-200-2011 dataset shows that The Loupe improves the accuracy of
a Swin-Base model from 85.40% to 88.06%, a significant gain of 2.66%.
Crucially, our qualitative analysis of the learned attention maps reveals that
The Loupe effectively localizes semantically meaningful features, providing a
valuable tool for understanding and trusting the model's decision-making
process.

Motivation: COVID-19大流行导致全球医疗资源紧张，呼吸系统衰竭是主要死因。传统医疗系统无法满足需求，需要自动化工具辅助医生评估病情严重程度

Method: 采用卷积神经网络(CNN)模型，基于患者COVID-19阳性检测后的肺部CT扫描数据进行训练和分析

Conclusion: 基于深度学习的CT扫描分析可以为医生提供准确的COVID-19严重程度评估，辅助临床决策，缓解医疗资源压力

Abstract: COVID19 took the world by storm since December 2019. A highly infectious
communicable disease, COVID19 is caused by the SARSCoV2 virus. By March 2020,
the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID19 as a global pandemic. A
pandemic in the 21st century after almost 100 years was something the world was
not prepared for, which resulted in the deaths of around 1.6 million people
worldwide. The most common symptoms of COVID19 were associated with the
respiratory system and resembled a cold, flu, or pneumonia. After extensive
research, doctors and scientists concluded that the main reason for lives being
lost due to COVID19 was failure of the respiratory system. Patients were dying
gasping for breath. Top healthcare systems of the world were failing badly as
there was an acute shortage of hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, and
ventilators. Many were dying without receiving any treatment at all. The aim of
this project is to help doctors decide the severity of COVID19 by reading the
patient's Computed Tomography (CT) scans of the lungs. Computer models are less
prone to human error, and Machine Learning or Neural Network models tend to
give better accuracy as training improves over time. We have decided to use a
Convolutional Neural Network model. Given that a patient tests positive, our
model will analyze the severity of COVID19 infection within one month of the
positive test result. The severity of the infection may be promising or
unfavorable (if it leads to intubation or death), based entirely on the CT
scans in the dataset.

Motivation: 医疗报告解释在医疗保健中至关重要，但目前缺乏标准化基准来评估医疗报告的结构化解释质量，特别是针对中文医疗环境。

Method: 构建包含1900份去标识化中文医疗报告的MedRepBench基准，支持端到端视觉语言模型评估和OCR+LLM纯文本评估，采用客观字段级召回率评估和基于LLM的自动化主观评估两种协议。

Result: 基于客观指标设计奖励函数并应用GRPO优化中等规模VLM，获得高达6%的召回率提升。OCR+LLM管道虽性能强劲但存在布局盲区和延迟问题。

Conclusion: MedRepBench为医疗报告结构化理解提供了标准化评估框架，揭示了当前方法的局限性，推动了向稳健、完全基于视觉的报告理解系统的进一步发展。

Abstract: Medical report interpretation plays a crucial role in healthcare, enabling
both patient-facing explanations and effective information flow across clinical
systems. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated general document understanding capabilities, there
remains a lack of standardized benchmarks to assess structured interpretation
quality in medical reports. We introduce MedRepBench, a comprehensive benchmark
built from 1,900 de-identified real-world Chinese medical reports spanning
diverse departments, patient demographics, and acquisition formats. The
benchmark is designed primarily to evaluate end-to-end VLMs for structured
medical report understanding. To enable controlled comparisons, we also include
a text-only evaluation setting using high-quality OCR outputs combined with
LLMs, allowing us to estimate the upper-bound performance when character
recognition errors are minimized. Our evaluation framework supports two
complementary protocols: (1) an objective evaluation measuring field-level
recall of structured clinical items, and (2) an automated subjective evaluation
using a powerful LLM as a scoring agent to assess factuality, interpretability,
and reasoning quality. Based on the objective metric, we further design a
reward function and apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve
a mid-scale VLM, achieving up to 6% recall gain. We also observe that the
OCR+LLM pipeline, despite strong performance, suffers from layout-blindness and
latency issues, motivating further progress toward robust, fully vision-based
report understanding.

Result: 在FLAME和HMDB51数据集上评估第一阶段方法，在Fire & Smoke数据集上评估第二阶段方法。实验结果显示显著降低计算成本的同时保持分类准确性，检测精度更高且推理时间相近。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了无人机平台计算资源有限的问题，实现了高效的实时野火监测和火源检测，为灾害应急响应提供了可行的技术方案。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become increasingly important in
disaster emergency response by enabling real-time aerial video analysis. Due to
the limited computational resources available on UAVs, large models cannot be
run independently for real-time analysis. To overcome this challenge, we
propose a lightweight and efficient two-stage framework for real-time wildfire
monitoring and fire source detection on UAV platforms. Specifically, in Stage
1, we utilize a policy network to identify and discard redundant video clips
using frame compression techniques, thereby reducing computational costs. In
addition, we introduce a station point mechanism that leverages future frame
information within the sequential policy network to improve prediction
accuracy. In Stage 2, once the frame is classified as "fire", we employ the
improved YOLOv8 model to localize the fire source. We evaluate the Stage 1
method using the FLAME and HMDB51 datasets, and the Stage 2 method using the
Fire & Smoke dataset. Experimental results show that our method significantly
reduces computational costs while maintaining classification accuracy in Stage
1, and achieves higher detection accuracy with similar inference time in Stage
2 compared to baseline methods.

TL;DR: CellEcoNet是一个新颖的空间感知深度学习框架，通过自然语言类比分析全切片图像，将细胞视为单词、细胞邻域视为短语、组织结构视为句子，自动学习上下文依赖含义来预测肺腺癌复发风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约70%的侵袭性肺腺癌患者在术后5年内复发，现有工具无法识别需要辅助治疗的患者，存在未满足的临床需求。

Method: CellEcoNet采用自然语言类比方法，将全切片图像建模为病理学语言：细胞作为单词，细胞邻域作为短语，组织结构作为句子，自动学习上下文依赖的空间交互特征来预测复发风险。

Result: 在456个H&E染色全切片数据集上，CellEcoNet达到AUC 77.8%和HR 9.54，显著优于IASLC分级系统(AUC 71.4%)、AJCC分期(AUC 64.0%)和其他计算方法(AUC 62.2-67.4%)，在不同人口学和临床亚组中表现一致公平。

Conclusion: CellEcoNet不仅提供了优越的预后预测性能，还代表了一种范式转变，通过解码肿瘤微环境的细胞"语言"来揭示细胞变异如何编码复发风险。

Abstract: Despite surgical resection, ~70% of invasive lung adenocarcinoma (ILA)
patients recur within five years, and current tools fail to identify those
needing adjuvant therapy. To address this unmet clinical need, we introduce
CellEcoNet, a novel spatially aware deep learning framework that models whole
slide images (WSIs) through natural language analogy, defining a "language of
pathology," where cells act as words, cellular neighborhoods become phrases,
and tissue architecture forms sentences. CellEcoNet learns these
context-dependent meanings automatically, capturing how subtle variations and
spatial interactions derive recurrence risk. On a dataset of 456 H&E-stained
WSIs, CellEcoNet achieved superior predictive performance (AUC:77.8% HR:9.54),
outperforming IASLC grading system (AUC:71.4% HR:2.36), AJCC Stage (AUC:64.0%
HR:1.17) and state-of-the-art computational methods (AUCs:62.2-67.4%).
CellEcoNet demonstrated fairness and consistent performance across diverse
demographic and clinical subgroups. Beyond prognosis, CellEcoNet marks a
paradigm shift by decoding the tumor microenvironment's cellular "language" to
reveal how subtle cell variations encode recurrence risk.

Result: 评估了多个主流文本到图像模型，发现大多数默认超参数配置在公平性-效用空间中被支配，可以轻松找到更好的超参数

Conclusion: 该方法提供了可重复的公平性评估框架，能够系统性地优化文本到图像模型在公平性和视觉质量之间的平衡

Abstract: Achieving fairness in text-to-image generation demands mitigating social
biases without compromising visual fidelity, a challenge critical to
responsible AI. Current fairness evaluation procedures for text-to-image models
rely on qualitative judgment or narrow comparisons, which limit the capacity to
assess both fairness and utility in these models and prevent reproducible
assessment of debiasing methods. Existing approaches typically employ ad-hoc,
human-centered visual inspections that are both error-prone and difficult to
replicate. We propose a method for evaluating fairness and utility in
text-to-image models using Pareto-optimal frontiers across hyperparametrization
of debiasing methods. Our method allows for comparison between distinct
text-to-image models, outlining all configurations that optimize fairness for a
given utility and vice-versa. To illustrate our evaluation method, we use
Normalized Shannon Entropy and ClipScore for fairness and utility evaluation,
respectively. We assess fairness and utility in Stable Diffusion, Fair
Diffusion, SDXL, DeCoDi, and FLUX text-to-image models. Our method shows that
most default hyperparameterizations of the text-to-image model are dominated
solutions in the fairness-utility space, and it is straightforward to find
better hyperparameters.

Result: 多模态大语言模型在基础信息提取方面表现良好，但在推理和元素定位、保持代码功能的编辑、以及维护层次结构和支持多语言内容的设计到代码生成方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 当前多模态大语言模型存在重要局限性，需要改进多模态和跨语言推理能力，以构建能够自动化多样化网页开发任务的未来网页代理。

Abstract: We present WebMMU, a multilingual benchmark that evaluates three core web
tasks: (1) website visual question answering, (2) code editing involving
HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and (3) mockup-to-code generation. Unlike prior benchmarks
that treat these tasks separately, WebMMU unifies them using expert-annotated,
real-world web data to assess models' abilities in complex multi-step
reasoning, precise element grounding, and functional UI comprehension and
coding. Our evaluation shows that while multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) perform well on basic information extraction, they struggle with
reasoning and grounding, editing code to preserve functionality, and generating
design-to-code that maintains hierarchy and supports multilingual content.
These findings reveal key limitations in current MLLMs and underscore the need
for improved multimodal and cross-lingual reasoning to build future web agents
capable of automating diverse web development tasks.

TL;DR: RoentGen-v2是一个文本到图像的扩散模型，用于生成胸部X光片，能够精确控制放射学发现和人口统计属性。通过合成数据预训练策略，显著提高了下游疾病分类模型的性能、泛化能力和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床可部署深度学习模型在不同患者群体中实现稳健性能和公平性的挑战，特别是在数据集规模和多样性有限的情况下。

Method: 开发RoentGen-v2文本到图像扩散模型，生成具有人口统计条件控制的合成胸部X光片；提出改进的训练策略：先使用合成数据进行监督预训练，然后在真实数据上进行微调。

Result: 合成预训练使下游分类模型准确率提高6.5%，而简单混合真实和合成数据仅提高2.7%；同时将诊断不足公平性差距减少19.3%；在5个机构的137,000多张胸部X光片上进行了广泛评估。

Conclusion: 合成成像技术有潜力在真实世界数据约束下推进公平和可泛化的医学深度学习，证明了合成数据预训练策略的有效性。

Abstract: Achieving robust performance and fairness across diverse patient populations
remains a challenge in developing clinically deployable deep learning models
for diagnostic imaging. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising
strategy to address limitations in dataset scale and diversity. We introduce
RoentGen-v2, a text-to-image diffusion model for chest radiographs that enables
fine-grained control over both radiographic findings and patient demographic
attributes, including sex, age, and race/ethnicity. RoentGen-v2 is the first
model to generate clinically plausible images with demographic conditioning,
facilitating the creation of a large, demographically balanced synthetic
dataset comprising over 565,000 images. We use this large synthetic dataset to
evaluate optimal training pipelines for downstream disease classification
models. In contrast to prior work that combines real and synthetic data
naively, we propose an improved training strategy that leverages synthetic data
for supervised pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Through
extensive evaluation on over 137,000 chest radiographs from five institutions,
we demonstrate that synthetic pretraining consistently improves model
performance, generalization to out-of-distribution settings, and fairness
across demographic subgroups. Across datasets, synthetic pretraining led to a
6.5% accuracy increase in the performance of downstream classification models,
compared to a modest 2.7% increase when naively combining real and synthetic
data. We observe this performance improvement simultaneously with the reduction
of the underdiagnosis fairness gap by 19.3%. These results highlight the
potential of synthetic imaging to advance equitable and generalizable medical
deep learning under real-world data constraints. We open source our code,
trained models, and synthetic dataset at

TL;DR: OVODA是一个开箱词汇3D物体和属性检测框架，无需已知新类别锚点尺寸，通过基础模型连接3D特征与文本语义，在nuScenes和Argoverse 2数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D物体检测方法受限于闭集假设，难以识别现实场景中的新物体及其属性，需要开发能够处理未知类别和属性的开放词汇检测系统。

Method: 使用基础模型连接3D特征与文本语义，联合检测属性（空间关系、运动状态等），采用特征拼接、提示调优、视角指定提示和水平翻转增强等关键技术。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse 2数据集上，在未给定新类别锚点尺寸的条件下，OVODA在开放词汇3D物体检测方面优于最先进方法，并能成功识别物体属性。

Conclusion: OVODA框架有效解决了开放词汇3D检测问题，同时发布了包含全面属性标注的OVAD数据集，为相关研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: 3D object detection plays a crucial role in autonomous systems, yet existing
methods are limited by closed-set assumptions and struggle to recognize novel
objects and their attributes in real-world scenarios. We propose OVODA, a novel
framework enabling both open-vocabulary 3D object and attribute detection with
no need to know the novel class anchor size. OVODA uses foundation models to
bridge the semantic gap between 3D features and texts while jointly detecting
attributes, e.g., spatial relationships, motion states, etc. To facilitate such
research direction, we propose OVAD, a new dataset that supplements existing 3D
object detection benchmarks with comprehensive attribute annotations. OVODA
incorporates several key innovations, including foundation model feature
concatenation, prompt tuning strategies, and specialized techniques for
attribute detection, including perspective-specified prompts and horizontal
flip augmentation. Our results on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets
show that under the condition of no given anchor sizes of novel classes, OVODA
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in open-vocabulary 3D object detection
while successfully recognizing object attributes. Our OVAD dataset is released
here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16904069 .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络在天文图像处理中存在局限性，需要计算昂贵的差异成像。本文旨在开发更适合像素级比较的架构，提高超新星检测的准确性和效率。

Method: 采用Transformer架构的神经网络，直接分析搜索图像和模板图像，无需进行差异成像处理。架构专门针对像素级详细比较进行优化。

Result: 在暗能量巡天(DES)的autoScan数据集上达到97.4%的分类准确率，训练集规模增大时差异图像的性能效用递减。即使输入图像未以超新星候选体为中心，网络仍能保持相似性能水平。

Conclusion: 该Transformer网络显著提升了大规模天文巡天中超新星检测的准确性和效率，证明了其在处理天文瞬变检测任务中的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce a transformer-based neural network for the accurate
classification of real and bogus transient detections in astronomical images.
This network advances beyond the conventional convolutional neural network
(CNN) methods, widely used in image processing tasks, by adopting an
architecture better suited for detailed pixel-by-pixel comparison. The
architecture enables efficient analysis of search and template images only,
thus removing the necessity for computationally-expensive difference imaging,
while maintaining high performance. Our primary evaluation was conducted using
the autoScan dataset from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), where the network
achieved a classification accuracy of 97.4% and diminishing performance utility
for difference image as the size of the training set grew. Further experiments
with DES data confirmed that the network can operate at a similar level even
when the input images are not centered on the supernova candidate. These
findings highlight the network's effectiveness in enhancing both accuracy and
efficiency of supernova detection in large-scale astronomical surveys.

TL;DR: NinA使用归一化流替代扩散模型作为VLA的动作解码器，实现单次采样，大幅提升推理速度，同时保持性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型需要多次迭代去噪步骤，限制了在需要高频控制的现实场景中的实用性

Method: 用归一化流(NF)替换扩散动作解码器，通过可逆变换实现单次采样，集成到FLOWER VLA架构并在LIBERO基准上微调

Result: NinA在相同训练机制下性能与扩散模型相当，但推理速度显著更快

Conclusion: NinA为高效、高频的VLA控制提供了一条有前景的路径，且不牺牲性能

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have established a
two-component architecture, where a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM)
encodes visual observations and task descriptions, and an action decoder maps
these representations to continuous actions. Diffusion models have been widely
adopted as action decoders due to their ability to model complex, multimodal
action distributions. However, they require multiple iterative denoising steps
at inference time or downstream techniques to speed up sampling, limiting their
practicality in real-world settings where high-frequency control is crucial. In
this work, we present NinA (Normalizing Flows in Action), a fast and expressive
alter- native to diffusion-based decoders for VLAs. NinA replaces the diffusion
action decoder with a Normalizing Flow (NF) that enables one-shot sampling
through an invertible transformation, significantly reducing inference time. We
integrate NinA into the FLOWER VLA architecture and fine-tune on the LIBERO
benchmark. Our experiments show that NinA matches the performance of its
diffusion-based counterpart under the same training regime, while achieving
substantially faster inference. These results suggest that NinA offers a
promising path toward efficient, high-frequency VLA control without
compromising performance.

TL;DR: RF-PGS是一个新颖的框架，通过平面高斯几何基元和结构化无线电辐射场，从稀疏路径损耗谱重建高保真无线电传播路径，为6G空间信道建模提供高效解决方案


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G时代需要大规模天线阵列和精确空间信道状态信息，传统信道建模方法在空间分辨率、效率和可扩展性方面面临挑战，现有辐射场方法存在几何不准确和训练成本高的问题

Method: 采用两阶段训练：第一阶段使用平面高斯几何基元进行几何训练实现密集表面对齐的场景重建；第二阶段使用结构化无线电辐射场和多视图损失准确建模无线电传播行为

Result: 相比现有辐射场方法，RF-PGS显著提高了重建精度，降低了训练成本，实现了无线信道的高效表示

Conclusion: RF-PGS为可扩展的6G空间CSI建模提供了实用解决方案，解决了传统方法和现有辐射场方法的局限性

Abstract: In the 6G era, the demand for higher system throughput and the implementation
of emerging 6G technologies require large-scale antenna arrays and accurate
spatial channel state information (Spatial-CSI). Traditional channel modeling
approaches, such as empirical models, ray tracing, and measurement-based
methods, face challenges in spatial resolution, efficiency, and scalability.
Radiance field-based methods have emerged as promising alternatives but still
suffer from geometric inaccuracy and costly supervision. This paper proposes
RF-PGS, a novel framework that reconstructs high-fidelity radio propagation
paths from only sparse path loss spectra. By introducing Planar Gaussians as
geometry primitives with certain RF-specific optimizations, RF-PGS achieves
dense, surface-aligned scene reconstruction in the first geometry training
stage. In the subsequent Radio Frequency (RF) training stage, the proposed
fully-structured radio radiance, combined with a tailored multi-view loss,
accurately models radio propagation behavior. Compared to prior radiance field
methods, RF-PGS significantly improves reconstruction accuracy, reduces
training costs, and enables efficient representation of wireless channels,
offering a practical solution for scalable 6G Spatial-CSI modeling.

TL;DR: GPO是一种新颖的可变形视网膜图像配准框架，通过高斯基元优化和结构化消息传递，解决了传统方法在纹理稀疏区域梯度信号弱的问题，显著提高了配准精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视网膜图像配准面临巨大挑战，因为图像中存在大面积同质区域和稀疏但关键的血管特征，导致标准学习框架中梯度信号有限，难以实现精确配准。

Method: 提出高斯基元优化(GPO)框架：1) 初始粗配准后提取关键点作为描述符控制节点；2) 每个节点建模为具有可训练位置、位移和半径的高斯基元；3) 使用KNN高斯插值传播位移信号；4) 通过多损失项进行端到端优化，确保关键点一致性和强度对齐。

Result: 在FIRE数据集上的实验表明，GPO将目标配准误差从6.2像素降低到约2.4像素，并将25像素处的AUC从0.770提高到0.938，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GPO通过在高梯度区域战略性锚定节点，确保了鲁棒的梯度流，有效解决了纹理稀疏区域的梯度消失问题，为视网膜图像配准提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deformable retinal image registration is notoriously difficult due to large
homogeneous regions and sparse but critical vascular features, which cause
limited gradient signals in standard learning-based frameworks. In this paper,
we introduce Gaussian Primitive Optimization (GPO), a novel iterative framework
that performs structured message passing to overcome these challenges. After an
initial coarse alignment, we extract keypoints at salient anatomical structures
(e.g., major vessels) to serve as a minimal set of descriptor-based control
nodes (DCN). Each node is modelled as a Gaussian primitive with trainable
position, displacement, and radius, thus adapting its spatial influence to
local deformation scales. A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Gaussian interpolation
then blends and propagates displacement signals from these information-rich
nodes to construct a globally coherent displacement field; focusing
interpolation on the top (K) neighbors reduces computational overhead while
preserving local detail. By strategically anchoring nodes in high-gradient
regions, GPO ensures robust gradient flow, mitigating vanishing gradient signal
in textureless areas. The framework is optimized end-to-end via a multi-term
loss that enforces both keypoint consistency and intensity alignment.
Experiments on the FIRE dataset show that GPO reduces the target registration
error from 6.2\,px to ~2.4\,px and increases the AUC at 25\,px from 0.770 to
0.938, substantially outperforming existing methods. The source code can be

Result: 在提出的基准上测试现有MLLMs和所提出的基于智能体的方法，发现大多数模型在此任务上面临显著挑战。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了情感推理在MLLMs中的重要性，提出的基准和方法为提升模型的情感理解能力提供了新的方向和评估标准。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been widely applied across
various fields due to their powerful perceptual and reasoning capabilities. In
the realm of psychology, these models hold promise for a deeper understanding
of human emotions and behaviors. However, recent research primarily focuses on
enhancing their emotion recognition abilities, leaving the substantial
potential in emotion reasoning, which is crucial for improving the naturalness
and effectiveness of human-machine interactions. Therefore, in this paper, we
introduce a multi-turn multimodal emotion understanding and reasoning (MTMEUR)
benchmark, which encompasses 1,451 video data from real-life scenarios, along
with 5,101 progressive questions. These questions cover various aspects,
including emotion recognition, potential causes of emotions, future action
prediction, etc. Besides, we propose a multi-agent framework, where each agent
specializes in a specific aspect, such as background context, character
dynamics, and event details, to improve the system's reasoning capabilities.
Furthermore, we conduct experiments with existing MLLMs and our agent-based
method on the proposed benchmark, revealing that most models face significant
challenges with this task.

Motivation: DreamBooth等个性化文本到图像模型需要微调大规模扩散主干网络，导致存储大量特定主题模型时产生显著存储开销

Method: 利用权重增量呈现强低秩结构的特点，应用奇异值分解对权重增量进行因式分解，然后采用基于能量的秩截断策略平衡压缩效率和重建保真度

Result: 在多主题数据集上的实验表明，Delta-SVD实现了显著压缩，在CLIP分数、SSIM和FID等生成质量指标上损失可忽略不计

Conclusion: 该方法实现了可扩展和高效的个性化扩散模型部署，是存储和部署大规模主题定制化实际应用的实用解决方案

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image models such as DreamBooth require fine-tuning
large-scale diffusion backbones, resulting in significant storage overhead when
maintaining many subject-specific models. We present Delta-SVD, a post-hoc,
training-free compression method that targets the parameter weights update
induced by DreamBooth fine-tuning. Our key observation is that these delta
weights exhibit strong low-rank structure due to the sparse and localized
nature of personalization. Delta-SVD first applies Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) to factorize the weight deltas, followed by an energy-based rank
truncation strategy to balance compression efficiency and reconstruction
fidelity. The resulting compressed models are fully plug-and-play and can be
re-constructed on-the-fly during inference. Notably, the proposed approach is
simple, efficient, and preserves the original model architecture. Experiments
on a multiple subject dataset demonstrate that Delta-SVD achieves substantial
compression with negligible loss in generation quality measured by CLIP score,
SSIM and FID. Our method enables scalable and efficient deployment of
personalized diffusion models, making it a practical solution for real-world
applications that require storing and deploying large-scale subject
customizations.

Conclusion: 该方法展示了视觉推理在情感计算中的潜力，为未来研究设立了新基准，证明了MLLM在图像情感分析中的有效性。

Abstract: Understanding how visual content communicates sentiment is critical in an era
where online interaction is increasingly dominated by this kind of media on
social platforms. However, this remains a challenging problem, as sentiment
perception is closely tied to complex, scene-level semantics. In this paper, we
propose an original framework, MLLMsent, to investigate the sentiment reasoning
capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through three
perspectives: (1) using those MLLMs for direct sentiment classification from
images; (2) associating them with pre-trained LLMs for sentiment analysis on
automatically generated image descriptions; and (3) fine-tuning the LLMs on
sentiment-labeled image descriptions. Experiments on a recent and established
benchmark demonstrate that our proposal, particularly the fine-tuned approach,
achieves state-of-the-art results outperforming Lexicon-, CNN-, and
Transformer-based baselines by up to 30.9%, 64.8%, and 42.4%, respectively,
across different levels of evaluators' agreement and sentiment polarity
categories. Remarkably, in a cross-dataset test, without any training on these
new data, our model still outperforms, by up to 8.26%, the best runner-up,
which has been trained directly on them. These results highlight the potential
of the proposed visual reasoning scheme for advancing affective computing,
while also establishing new benchmarks for future research.

Motivation: 解决恶劣天气条件下视觉信息损失问题，现有方法缺乏对文本信息的有效分类和深入分析，需要更好的语义感知能力来提供更清晰的场景表示。

Method: 提出AWM-Fuse方法，包含全局特征感知模块（使用BLIP生成字幕提取整体场景特征和主要退化类型）和局部模块（使用ChatGPT生成详细场景描述关注具体退化效果），通过文本描述约束融合图像生成。

Result: 在复杂天气条件和下游任务中优于当前最先进方法，实验证明该方法能够学习更有意义的视觉特征。

Conclusion: AWM-Fuse通过有效的文本感知和约束机制，成功提升了恶劣天气条件下多模态图像融合的性能，为语义感知提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-modality image fusion (MMIF) in adverse weather aims to address the
loss of visual information caused by weather-related degradations, providing
clearer scene representations. Although less studies have attempted to
incorporate textual information to improve semantic perception, they often lack
effective categorization and thorough analysis of textual content. In response,
we propose AWM-Fuse, a novel fusion method for adverse weather conditions,
designed to handle multiple degradations through global and local text
perception within a unified, shared weight architecture. In particular, a
global feature perception module leverages BLIP-produced captions to extract
overall scene features and identify primary degradation types, thus promoting
generalization across various adverse weather conditions. Complementing this,
the local module employs detailed scene descriptions produced by ChatGPT to
concentrate on specific degradation effects through concrete textual cues,
thereby capturing finer details. Furthermore, textual descriptions are used to
constrain the generation of fusion images, effectively steering the network
learning process toward better alignment with real semantic labels, thereby
promoting the learning of more meaningful visual features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AWM-Fuse outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods in complex weather conditions and downstream tasks. Our code is

Conclusion: SAEViT提供了一个轻量高效的解决方案，在各种基础视觉任务中实现了计算效率和性能的良好平衡。

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has prevailed in computer vision tasks due to its
strong long-range dependency modelling ability. However, its large model size
with high computational cost and weak local feature modeling ability hinder its
application in real scenarios. To balance computation efficiency and
performance, we propose SAEViT (Sparse-Attention-Efficient-ViT), a lightweight
ViT based model with convolution blocks, in this paper to achieve efficient
downstream vision tasks. Specifically, SAEViT introduces a Sparsely Aggregated
Attention (SAA) module that performs adaptive sparse sampling based on image
redundancy and recovers the feature map via deconvolution operation, which
significantly reduces the computational complexity of attention operations. In
addition, a Channel-Interactive Feed-Forward Network (CIFFN) layer is developed
to enhance inter-channel information exchange through feature decomposition and
redistribution, mitigating redundancy in traditional feed-forward networks
(FNN). Finally, a hierarchical pyramid structure with embedded depth-wise
separable convolutional blocks (DWSConv) is devised to further strengthen
convolutional features. Extensive experiments on mainstream datasets show that
SAEViT achieves Top-1 accuracies of 76.3\% and 79.6\% on the ImageNet-1K
classification task with only 0.8 GFLOPs and 1.3 GFLOPs, respectively,
demonstrating a lightweight solution for various fundamental vision tasks.

Method: 构建多维图像质量评估框架，包括5个技术维度和4个美学维度。每个维度单独训练分支，然后将各维度特征融合生成最终质量评分。还可通过调整维度权重来灵活训练图像修复模型。

Result: 大量实验证明MDIQA取得了优越的性能，并能有效灵活地应用于图像修复任务。

Conclusion: MDIQA框架能够更好地捕捉人类多维度视觉感知特性，在图像质量评估和图像修复方面都具有很好的应用价值。

Abstract: Recent advancements in image quality assessment (IQA), driven by
sophisticated deep neural network designs, have significantly improved the
ability to approach human perceptions. However, most existing methods are
obsessed with fitting the overall score, neglecting the fact that humans
typically evaluate image quality from different dimensions before arriving at
an overall quality assessment. To overcome this problem, we propose a
multi-dimensional image quality assessment (MDIQA) framework. Specifically, we
model image quality across various perceptual dimensions, including five
technical and four aesthetic dimensions, to capture the multifaceted nature of
human visual perception within distinct branches. Each branch of our MDIQA is
initially trained under the guidance of a separate dimension, and the
respective features are then amalgamated to generate the final IQA score.
Additionally, when the MDIQA model is ready, we can deploy it for a flexible
training of image restoration (IR) models, enabling the restoration results to
better align with varying user preferences through the adjustment of perceptual
dimension weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MDIQA achieves
superior performance and can be effectively and flexibly applied to image
restoration tasks. The code is available: https://github.com/YaoShunyu19/MDIQA.

*Qing Zhang,Jinguang Tong,Jie Hong,Jing Zhang,Xuesong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEGS是一个无需训练、即插即用的框架，通过在采样时注入结构能量梯度来解决文本到3D生成中的Janus问题，显著改善多视角一致性和几何对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到3D生成存在Janus问题，即物体从正面看正确但从其他角度会出现重复或扭曲的几何形状，这源于2D扩散先验中的视角偏差。

Method: 提出Structural Energy-Guided Sampling (SEGS)，在PCA子空间中定义结构能量，并将其梯度注入去噪轨迹，引导几何朝向预期视角，同时保持外观保真度。

Result: SEGS显著减少了Janus伪影，实现了更好的几何对齐和视角一致性，无需重新训练或修改权重。

Conclusion: SEGS是一个有效的训练免费解决方案，可无缝集成到现有SDS/VSD流程中，解决了文本到3D生成中的关键视角一致性问题。

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation often suffers from the Janus problem, where objects
look correct from the front but collapse into duplicated or distorted geometry
from other angles. We attribute this failure to viewpoint bias in 2D diffusion
priors, which propagates into 3D optimization. To address this, we propose
Structural Energy-Guided Sampling (SEGS), a training-free, plug-and-play
framework that enforces multi-view consistency entirely at sampling time. SEGS
defines a structural energy in a PCA subspace of intermediate U-Net features
and injects its gradients into the denoising trajectory, steering geometry
toward the intended viewpoint while preserving appearance fidelity. Integrated
seamlessly into SDS/VSD pipelines, SEGS significantly reduces Janus artifacts,
achieving improved geometric alignment and viewpoint consistency without
retraining or weight modification.

*Yudong Hu,Yueju Han,Rui Sun,Jinke Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSPCaps是一个新颖的多尺度胶囊网络架构，通过多尺度特征提取、统一补丁化胶囊层和跨一致性路由机制，有效解决了传统胶囊网络忽视多尺度特征和特征融合困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有胶囊网络通常依赖单一高层特征图，忽略了多尺度特征的丰富互补信息，且传统特征融合策略难以协调多尺度特征差异，导致分类性能不佳。

Method: 提出MSPCaps架构，包含三个核心组件：多尺度ResNet骨干网络(MSRB)提取多尺度特征；补丁化胶囊层(PatchifyCaps)将多尺度特征统一分割成初级胶囊；跨一致性路由(CAR)块通过识别最大一致性的跨尺度预测对来自适应路由多尺度胶囊。

Result: MSPCaps展现出卓越的可扩展性和鲁棒性，在分类准确率上持续超越多个基线方法，参数量从高效的Tiny模型(344.3K)到强大的Large模型(10.9M)不等。

Conclusion: 该方法在推进特征表示学习方面具有巨大潜力，通过有效整合多尺度特征学习和高效胶囊路由，显著提升了胶囊网络的性能。

Abstract: Capsule Network (CapsNet) has demonstrated significant potential in visual
recognition by capturing spatial relationships and part-whole hierarchies for
learning equivariant feature representations. However, existing CapsNet and
variants often rely on a single high-level feature map, overlooking the rich
complementary information from multi-scale features. Furthermore, conventional
feature fusion strategies (e.g., addition and concatenation) struggle to
reconcile multi-scale feature discrepancies, leading to suboptimal
classification performance. To address these limitations, we propose the
Multi-Scale Patchify Capsule Network (MSPCaps), a novel architecture that
integrates multi-scale feature learning and efficient capsule routing.
Specifically, MSPCaps consists of three key components: a Multi-Scale ResNet
Backbone (MSRB), a Patchify Capsule Layer (PatchifyCaps), and Cross-Agreement
Routing (CAR) blocks. First, the MSRB extracts diverse multi-scale feature
representations from input images, preserving both fine-grained details and
global contextual information. Second, the PatchifyCaps partitions these
multi-scale features into primary capsules using a uniform patch size,
equipping the model with the ability to learn from diverse receptive fields.
Finally, the CAR block adaptively routes the multi-scale capsules by
identifying cross-scale prediction pairs with maximum agreement. Unlike the
simple concatenation of multiple self-routing blocks, CAR ensures that only the
most coherent capsules contribute to the final voting. Our proposed MSPCaps
achieves remarkable scalability and superior robustness, consistently
surpassing multiple baseline methods in terms of classification accuracy, with
configurations ranging from a highly efficient Tiny model (344.3K parameters)
to a powerful Large model (10.9M parameters), highlighting its potential in
advancing feature representation learning.

TL;DR: CC-CMR是一种基于对比学习和跨模态对齐的框架，用于无钆对比剂的心肌病筛查，通过将电影CMR与LGE序列的潜在空间对齐，在电影CMR中编码纤维化特异性病理信息，实现了94.3%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏磁共振(CMR)是心肌病诊断的金标准，但依赖钆对比剂和人工密集解读限制了其在人群规模筛查中的应用，需要开发无钆的自动化筛查方法。

Method: 提出对比学习和跨模态对齐框架，通过特征交互模块同时优化诊断精度和跨模态特征一致性，并采用不确定性引导的自适应训练机制动态校准任务特定目标。

Result: 在多中心231名受试者数据上评估，CC-CMR达到0.943的准确率(95% CI: 0.886-0.986)，比最先进的仅电影CMR模型提升4.3%，同时消除了钆依赖性。

Conclusion: CC-CMR展示了在广泛人群和医疗环境中进行无钆心肌病筛查的临床可行性，为大规模人群筛查提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cardiomyopathy, a principal contributor to heart failure and sudden cardiac
mortality, demands precise early screening. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR),
recognized as the diagnostic 'gold standard' through multiparametric protocols,
holds the potential to serve as an accurate screening tool. However, its
reliance on gadolinium contrast and labor-intensive interpretation hinders
population-scale deployment. We propose CC-CMR, a Contrastive Learning and
Cross-Modal alignment framework for gadolinium-free cardiomyopathy screening
using cine CMR sequences. By aligning the latent spaces of cine CMR and Late
Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) sequences, our model encodes fibrosis-specific
pathology into cine CMR embeddings. A Feature Interaction Module concurrently
optimizes diagnostic precision and cross-modal feature congruence, augmented by
an uncertainty-guided adaptive training mechanism that dynamically calibrates
task-specific objectives to ensure model generalizability. Evaluated on
multi-center data from 231 subjects, CC-CMR achieves accuracy of 0.943 (95% CI:
0.886-0.986), outperforming state-of-the-art cine-CMR-only models by 4.3% while
eliminating gadolinium dependency, demonstrating its clinical viability for
wide range of populations and healthcare environments.

*Qi Song,Ziyuan Luo,Ka Chun Cheung,Simon See,Renjie Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Invert3D是一个新颖的3D内容个性化框架，通过建立3D表示与文本嵌入空间的对齐，实现无需重新训练的自然语言驱动的3D内容个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D个性化方法主要依赖基于知识蒸馏的方法，需要计算昂贵的重新训练过程。虽然视觉语言模型如CLIP能够通过对齐的视觉-文本嵌入空间实现直接图像个性化，但由于3D内容与2D图像的结构差异，这些技术无法直接应用于3D个性化。

Method: 开发了一种相机条件化的3D到文本逆机制，将3D内容投影到与文本嵌入对齐的3D嵌入空间中。这种方法建立了3D表示与文本嵌入空间之间的对齐。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，Invert3D能够有效实现3D内容的个性化。该方法消除了计算昂贵的重新训练过程的需求。

Conclusion: Invert3D通过建立3D内容与文本嵌入空间的对齐，为3D内容个性化提供了一个便捷高效的解决方案，实现了通过自然语言提示对3D内容进行高效操作和个性化。

Abstract: Recent advances in NeRF and 3DGS have significantly enhanced the efficiency
and quality of 3D content synthesis. However, efficient personalization of
generated 3D content remains a critical challenge. Current 3D personalization
approaches predominantly rely on knowledge distillation-based methods, which
require computationally expensive retraining procedures. To address this
challenge, we propose \textbf{Invert3D}, a novel framework for convenient 3D
content personalization. Nowadays, vision-language models such as CLIP enable
direct image personalization through aligned vision-text embedding spaces.
However, the inherent structural differences between 3D content and 2D images
preclude direct application of these techniques to 3D personalization. Our
approach bridges this gap by establishing alignment between 3D representations
and text embedding spaces. Specifically, we develop a camera-conditioned
3D-to-text inverse mechanism that projects 3D contents into a 3D embedding
aligned with text embeddings. This alignment enables efficient manipulation and
personalization of 3D content through natural language prompts, eliminating the
need for computationally retraining procedures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Invert3D achieves effective personalization of 3D content. Our

TL;DR: NAT方法通过针对特定神经元而非整个嵌入层来生成可迁移的对抗扰动，在跨模型和跨域设置中分别超越现有基线14%和4%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在嵌入层级别优化时往往过度关注少数相似概念的神经元，而忽略了层内其他神经元，限制了对抗样本的可迁移性

Method: 提出神经元攻击迁移性方法(NAT)，从嵌入层分离转向神经元特异性方法，针对单个神经元进行攻击以破坏神经网络的核心单元

Result: 在41个多样化ImageNet模型和9个细粒度模型上的实验显示，NAT在跨模型设置中超越基线14%以上，跨域设置中超越4%以上，仅需10次查询即可达到高欺骗率

Conclusion: 针对单个神经元的攻击方法为跨模型迁移性提供了共同基础，通过利用训练生成器的互补攻击能力，能够高效实现高欺骗率

Abstract: The generation of transferable adversarial perturbations typically involves
training a generator to maximize embedding separation between clean and
adversarial images at a single mid-layer of a source model. In this work, we
build on this approach and introduce Neuron Attack for Transferability (NAT), a
method designed to target specific neuron within the embedding. Our approach is
motivated by the observation that previous layer-level optimizations often
disproportionately focus on a few neurons representing similar concepts,
leaving other neurons within the attacked layer minimally affected. NAT shifts
the focus from embedding-level separation to a more fundamental,
neuron-specific approach. We find that targeting individual neurons effectively
disrupts the core units of the neural network, providing a common basis for
transferability across different models. Through extensive experiments on 41
diverse ImageNet models and 9 fine-grained models, NAT achieves fooling rates
that surpass existing baselines by over 14\% in cross-model and 4\% in
cross-domain settings. Furthermore, by leveraging the complementary attacking
capabilities of the trained generators, we achieve impressive fooling rates
within just 10 queries. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常只提供最终评分而缺乏解释性分析，限制了在体育、医疗和机器人等领域的实际应用。需要能够提供结构化详细反馈的动作评估系统。

Method: 结合两个核心思想：(1) 逐步动作推理 - 专门设计的思维链过程，从整体识别到子动作分析再到最终评分；(2) 分层策略学习 - 强化学习策略，学习细粒度子动作动态并与高级动作质量对齐。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现出优越性能，证明了该方法能够提供准确且可解释的动作评估。

Conclusion: HieroAction通过整合推理路径和策略学习，确保了评估的准确性和可解释性，为人类动作评估提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Evaluating human actions with clear and detailed feedback is important in
areas such as sports, healthcare, and robotics, where decisions rely not only
on final outcomes but also on interpretable reasoning. However, most existing
methods provide only a final score without explanation or detailed analysis,
limiting their practical applicability. To address this, we introduce
HieroAction, a vision-language model that delivers accurate and structured
assessments of human actions. HieroAction builds on two key ideas: (1) Stepwise
Action Reasoning, a tailored chain of thought process designed specifically for
action assessment, which guides the model to evaluate actions step by step,
from overall recognition through sub action analysis to final scoring, thus
enhancing interpretability and structured understanding; and (2) Hierarchical
Policy Learning, a reinforcement learning strategy that enables the model to
learn fine grained sub action dynamics and align them with high level action
quality, thereby improving scoring precision. The reasoning pathway structures
the evaluation process, while policy learning refines each stage through reward
based optimization. Their integration ensures accurate and interpretable
assessments, as demonstrated by superior performance across multiple benchmark
datasets. Code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: RPD-Diff是一种区域自适应物理引导去雾扩散模型，通过物理引导中间状态目标策略和雾霾感知去噪时间步预测器，有效处理密集和非均匀雾霾条件下的图像去雾问题。

Motivation: 传统基于扩散的去雾方法在密集和非均匀雾霾条件下存在生成条件不足和空间适应性差的问题，导致恢复效果不佳。

Method: 提出RPD-Diff模型，包含物理引导中间状态目标策略(PIST)利用物理先验重新制定扩散马尔可夫链，以及雾霾感知去噪时间步预测器(HADTP)通过透射图交叉注意力机制动态调整补丁特定的去噪时间步。

Conclusion: RPD-Diff通过物理引导和区域自适应机制，有效解决了密集非均匀雾霾条件下的图像去雾挑战，为复杂雾霾场景下的能见度增强提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: Single-image dehazing under dense and non-uniform haze conditions remains
challenging due to severe information degradation and spatial heterogeneity.
Traditional diffusion-based dehazing methods struggle with insufficient
generation conditioning and lack of adaptability to spatially varying haze
distributions, which leads to suboptimal restoration. To address these
limitations, we propose RPD-Diff, a Region-adaptive Physics-guided Dehazing
Diffusion Model for robust visibility enhancement in complex haze scenarios.
RPD-Diff introduces a Physics-guided Intermediate State Targeting (PIST)
strategy, which leverages physical priors to reformulate the diffusion Markov
chain by generation target transitions, mitigating the issue of insufficient
conditioning in dense haze scenarios. Additionally, the Haze-Aware Denoising
Timestep Predictor (HADTP) dynamically adjusts patch-specific denoising
timesteps employing a transmission map cross-attention mechanism, adeptly
managing non-uniform haze distributions. Extensive experiments across four
real-world datasets demonstrate that RPD-Diff achieves state-of-the-art
performance in challenging dense and non-uniform haze scenarios, delivering
high-quality, haze-free images with superior detail clarity and color fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的拥挤人群计数模型设计原则：强调模型的局部建模能力，并设计了LIMM模型，通过窗口划分和对比学习策略显著提升了局部密度识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新思考拥挤人群计数的本质特征：个体（人头）在图像中通常占据很小比例，现有方法却追求大感受野而忽视了局部建模能力的重要性。

Method: 提出LIMM模型，采用两种策略：1）窗口划分设计，将输入图像划分为网格窗口；2）窗口级对比学习设计，增强模型区分局部密度水平的能力；最后使用全局注意力模块处理偶尔出现的大尺寸个体。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上的实验表明，该模型在局部建模能力上有显著提升（如在JHU-Crowd++高密度子集上MAE提升8.7%），同时不损害对大尺寸个体的计数能力，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 强调局部建模能力是拥挤人群计数任务的重要设计原则，LIMM模型通过创新的窗口划分和对比学习策略有效解决了局部密度识别问题，为拥挤人群计数提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The motivation of this paper originates from rethinking an essential
characteristic of crowd counting: individuals (heads of humans) in the crowd
counting task typically occupy a very small portion of the image. This
characteristic has never been the focus of existing works: they typically use
the same backbone as other visual tasks and pursue a large receptive field.
This drives us to propose a new model design principle of crowd counting:
emphasizing local modeling capability of the model. We follow the principle and
design a crowd counting model named Local Information Matters Model (LIMM). The
main innovation lies in two strategies: a window partitioning design that
applies grid windows to the model input, and a window-wise contrastive learning
design to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between local density
levels. Moreover, a global attention module is applied to the end of the model
to handle the occasionally occurring large-sized individuals. Extensive
experiments on multiple public datasets illustrate that the proposed model
shows a significant improvement in local modeling capability (8.7\% in MAE on
the JHU-Crowd++ high-density subset for example), without compromising its
ability to count large-sized ones, which achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在处理科学图表时缺乏对常见视觉扰动（如噪声、模糊、遮挡）的鲁棒性，而现有评估基准大多忽视了这一问题，限制了模型在实际科学工程应用中的部署。

Method: 提出了RDR框架，采用自适应多视图和一致性验证机制（AMCV），生成多个扰动版本的图表进行并行推理，并通过基于一致性的自校正循环。同时构建了SciDiagram-Robust数据集，并提出了PRS和VDC两个新评估指标。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了多模态大语言模型在视觉扰动下的脆弱性，提出的RDR框架和评估方法为提升模型在实际科学应用中的鲁棒性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants (LVLMs) hold
immense promise for scientific and engineering applications, particularly in
processing visual information like scientific diagrams. However, their
practical deployment is hindered by a critical lack of robustness to common
visual perturbations such as noise, blur, and occlusions, which are prevalent
in real-world scientific documents. Existing evaluation benchmarks largely
overlook this challenge, leaving the robust reasoning capabilities of LVLMs on
visually degraded scientific diagrams underexplored. To address this, we
introduce the Robust Diagram Reasoning (RDR) framework, a novel approach
designed to enhance and rigorously evaluate LVLMs' performance under such
conditions. At its core, RDR employs an Adaptive Multi-View & Consistency
Verification (AMCV) mechanism, which involves generating multiple perturbed
versions of a diagram, performing parallel inference, and then applying a
consistency-based self-correction loop. We also propose two new metrics,
Perturbation Robustness Score (PRS) and Visual Degradation Consistency (VDC),
to quantify robustness. Furthermore, we construct SciDiagram-Robust, the first
large-scale scientific diagram question-answering dataset specifically
augmented with diverse, programmatically generated visual perturbations. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art closed-source
LVLMs like GPT-4V exhibit significant performance degradation when faced with
perturbed inputs (Clean Accuracy 85.2% vs. PRS 72.1%).

Conclusion: BSAM通过平衡泛化能力有效解决了不平衡回归问题，为回归任务提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Regression is fundamental in computer vision and is widely used in various
tasks including age estimation, depth estimation, target localization, \etc
However, real-world data often exhibits imbalanced distribution, making
regression models perform poorly especially for target values with rare
observations~(known as the imbalanced regression problem). In this paper, we
reframe imbalanced regression as an imbalanced generalization problem. To
tackle that, we look into the loss sharpness property for measuring the
generalization ability of regression models in the observation space. Namely,
given a certain perturbation on the model parameters, we check how model
performance changes according to the loss values of different target
observations. We propose a simple yet effective approach called Balanced
Sharpness-Aware Minimization~(BSAM) to enforce the uniform generalization
ability of regression models for the entire observation space. In particular,
we start from the traditional sharpness-aware minimization and then introduce a
novel targeted reweighting strategy to homogenize the generalization ability
across the observation space, which guarantees a theoretical generalization
bound. Extensive experiments on multiple vision regression tasks, including age
and depth estimation, demonstrate that our BSAM method consistently outperforms
existing approaches. The code is available

Conclusion: 分层设计有效提升了细粒度视觉语言理解和精确接地能力，验证了从粗到细认知处理方式在视觉语言建模中的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in natural language processing and multimodal
understanding. Despite their impressive generalization capabilities, current
LVLMs often exhibit insufficient robustness, proneness to hallucination, and
reasoning errors in complex real-world scenarios, particularly when precise
image region localization and fine-grained visual reasoning are required. To
address these limitations, we propose the Hierarchical Contextual Grounding
LVLM (HCG-LVLM), a novel architecture that mimics human coarse-to-fine
cognitive processing. HCG-LVLM employs a two-layered approach: a Global
Contextual Perception layer for initial broad understanding and a Fine-grained
Local Grounding layer. The latter incorporates a Local Detail Enhancement
Module to extract high-resolution features and a Semantic Consistency Validator
to ensure accurate, hallucination-free visual-language alignment. Through an
adaptive fusion mechanism, information from both layers is integrated for
robust and precise outputs. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets,
including GQA, A-OKVQA for fine-grained VQA, and RefCOCO/+/g for Referring
Expression Comprehension, demonstrate that HCG-LVLM consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models such as Flamingo, BLIP-2, and MiniGPT-4. Our model
achieves superior accuracy and significantly reduces hallucination, validating
the effectiveness of its hierarchical design in enhancing fine-grained
visual-language understanding and precise grounding capabilities.

Dataset with multiple augmentation techniques to increase robustness for
diverse image manipulations. The class imbalance issues are handled by
oversampling and a train-validation split of the dataset in a stratified
manner. Performance is evaluated using the accuracy metric on the training and
testing datasets, followed by a prediction score on a random image of people,
irrespective of their realness. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art results
on the test dataset to meticulously detect Deepfake images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为JPS（Joint Parameter Selection）的新方法，通过选择性地微调预训练模型中一小部分稀疏参数，在保持模型泛化能力的同时实现领域泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全参数微调会损害预训练视觉模型固有泛化能力的问题，需要在任务适应和泛化保持之间取得平衡。

Method: 使用双操作符选择机制，识别和更新在所有源域中表现出一致且显著梯度的参数，限制只更新一小部分稀疏参数子集。

Result: 在广泛的基准实验中，JPS相比最先进的领域泛化方法取得了更优越的性能，证明了方法的效率和有效性。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和实验验证，选择性参数微调是保持预训练模型泛化能力的有效策略，JPS方法在领域泛化任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Domain generalization seeks to develop models trained on a limited set of
source domains that are capable of generalizing effectively to unseen target
domains. While the predominant approach leverages large-scale pre-trained
vision models as initialization, recent studies have highlighted that full
fine-tuning can compromise the intrinsic generalization capabilities of these
models. To address this limitation, parameter-efficient adaptation strategies
have emerged, wherein only a subset of model parameters is selectively
fine-tuned, thereby balancing task adaptation with the preservation of
generalization. Motivated by this paradigm, we introduce Joint Parameter
Selection (JPS), a novel method that restricts updates to a small, sparse
subset of parameters, thereby retaining and harnessing the generalization
strength of pre-trained models. Theoretically, we establish a generalization
error bound that explicitly accounts for the sparsity of parameter updates,
thereby providing a principled justification for selective fine-tuning.
Practically, we design a selection mechanism employing dual operators to
identify and update parameters exhibiting consistent and significant gradients
across all source domains. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that JPS
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art domain
generalization methods, substantiating both the efficiency and efficacy of the
proposed approach.

TL;DR: HiCache是一个无需训练的特征缓存加速框架，通过Hermite多项式对齐特征导数的高斯特性，实现扩散模型6.24倍加速同时保持生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然生成效果出色但计算成本高昂，现有特征缓存方法因无法准确建模特征演化复杂动态而导致质量损失

Method: 利用扩散变换器中特征导数近似呈现多元高斯特性的洞察，采用Hermite多项式作为理论最优基函数，并引入双尺度机制确保数值稳定性

Result: 在FLUX.1-dev上实现6.24倍加速且质量超过基线，在文本到图像、视频生成和超分辨率任务中均表现优异

Conclusion: HiCache通过理论对齐和经验特性的结合，为扩散模型提供了高效且高质量的推理加速解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in content generation but
suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to iterative sampling. While
recent feature caching methods tend to accelerate inference through temporal
extrapolation, these methods still suffer from server quality loss due to the
failure in modeling the complex dynamics of feature evolution. To solve this
problem, this paper presents HiCache, a training-free acceleration framework
that fundamentally improves feature prediction by aligning mathematical tools
with empirical properties. Our key insight is that feature derivative
approximations in Diffusion Transformers exhibit multivariate Gaussian
characteristics, motivating the use of Hermite polynomials-the potentially
theoretically optimal basis for Gaussian-correlated processes. Besides, We
further introduce a dual-scaling mechanism that ensures numerical stability
while preserving predictive accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate
HiCache's superiority: achieving 6.24x speedup on FLUX.1-dev while exceeding
baseline quality, maintaining strong performance across text-to-image, video
generation, and super-resolution tasks. Core implementation is provided in the
appendix, with complete code to be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: 解决现有深度学习方法在医学图像分割中无法同时兼顾分割精度和计算效率的问题，当前方法要么性能好但计算复杂，要么效率高但精度低

Method: 提出EDLDNet网络，包含噪声解码器（训练时加入结构化扰动增强鲁棒性，推理时只使用无噪声解码器降低计算成本）、多尺度卷积注意力模块、注意力门和上卷积块来优化特征表示，并利用基于突变的损失函数增强泛化能力

Result: 在四个公开医学影像数据集上超越SOTA方法，在Synapse数据集上达到84.00% Dice分数，比UNet提升13.89%，同时减少89.7%的MACs操作。相比EMCAD等方法，在保持计算效率的同时获得更高的Dice分数

Conclusion: EDLDNet在多样化数据集上表现出优异的泛化能力、计算效率和鲁棒性，成功解决了医学图像分割中精度与效率的平衡问题

Abstract: Proper segmentation of organs-at-risk is important for radiation therapy,
surgical planning, and diagnostic decision-making in medical image analysis.
While deep learning-based segmentation architectures have made significant
progress, they often fail to balance segmentation accuracy with computational
efficiency. Most of the current state-of-the-art methods either prioritize
performance at the cost of high computational complexity or compromise accuracy
for efficiency. This paper addresses this gap by introducing an efficient
dual-line decoder segmentation network (EDLDNet). The proposed method features
a noisy decoder, which learns to incorporate structured perturbation at
training time for better model robustness, yet at inference time only the
noise-free decoder is executed, leading to lower computational cost.
Multi-Scale convolutional Attention Modules (MSCAMs), Attention Gates (AGs),
and Up-Convolution Blocks (UCBs) are further utilized to optimize feature
representation and boost segmentation performance. By leveraging multi-scale
segmentation masks from both decoders, we also utilize a mutation-based loss
function to enhance the model's generalization. Our approach outperforms SOTA
segmentation architectures on four publicly available medical imaging datasets.
EDLDNet achieves SOTA performance with an 84.00% Dice score on the Synapse
dataset, surpassing baseline model like UNet by 13.89% in Dice score while
significantly reducing Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) by 89.7%. Compared
to recent approaches like EMCAD, our EDLDNet not only achieves higher Dice
score but also maintains comparable computational efficiency. The outstanding
performance across diverse datasets establishes EDLDNet's strong
generalization, computational efficiency, and robustness. The source code,
pre-processed data, and pre-trained weights will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有弱监督语义分割方法过于强调类间分离，忽视了相关类别间的共享语义，缺乏细粒度区分能力

Method: 使用大语言模型推导类别聚类来编码类间关系，引入类感知的patch级对比损失来增强类内一致性和类间分离

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2012和MS COCO 2014数据集上的实验表明，CPC超越了现有的最先进方法

Conclusion: CPC通过层次化设计利用聚类作为粗粒度语义先验，同时保持细粒度边界，有效减少了视觉相似类别间的混淆

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels has
gained attention for its cost-effectiveness. Most existing methods emphasize
inter-class separation, often neglecting the shared semantics among related
categories and lacking fine-grained discrimination. To address this, we propose
Contrastive Prompt Clustering (CPC), a novel WSSS framework. CPC exploits Large
Language Models (LLMs) to derive category clusters that encode intrinsic
inter-class relationships, and further introduces a class-aware patch-level
contrastive loss to enforce intra-class consistency and inter-class separation.
This hierarchical design leverages clusters as coarse-grained semantic priors
while preserving fine-grained boundaries, thereby reducing confusion among
visually similar categories. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014
demonstrate that CPC surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in WSSS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于网格的3D仿真在复杂环境（如密集温室）中表现不佳，而现有的神经渲染方法虽然视觉真实感强，但缺乏集成基准标记的能力，而基准标记对机器人定位和控制至关重要。

Method: 开发了一种混合框架，将高斯泼溅（GS）的光真实感与结构化标记表示相结合，提出了一种新颖算法用于在杂乱场景中高效生成基于GS的基准标记（如AprilTags）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在效率和姿态估计精度方面均优于传统的图像拟合技术，并在温室仿真中展示了框架的实际应用潜力。

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂环境中的高保真3D仿真提供了有效解决方案，特别是在农业机器人应用场景中具有重要价值，能够处理密集植被、相似元素和遮挡等挑战性感知问题。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D simulation is critical for training mobile robots, but its
traditional reliance on mesh-based representations often struggle in complex
environments, such as densely packed greenhouses featuring occlusions and
repetitive structures. Recent neural rendering methods, like Gaussian Splatting
(GS), achieve remarkable visual realism but lack flexibility to incorporate
fiducial markers, which are essential for robotic localization and control. We
propose a hybrid framework that combines the photorealism of GS with structured
marker representations. Our core contribution is a novel algorithm for
efficiently generating GS-based fiducial markers (e.g., AprilTags) within
cluttered scenes. Experiments show that our approach outperforms traditional
image-fitting techniques in both efficiency and pose-estimation accuracy. We
further demonstrate the framework's potential in a greenhouse simulation. This
agricultural setting serves as a challenging testbed, as its combination of
dense foliage, similar-looking elements, and occlusions pushes the limits of
perception, thereby highlighting the framework's value for real-world
applications.

TL;DR: 通过双正交引导策略（DOG）改善扩散模型在手写文本生成中的读可性和风格多样性，减少虫喷和失真


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准扩散模型在手写文本生成中容易记忆训练样本，在复杂风格和词汇外单词上产生虫喷和失真，影响生成质量

Method: 提出双正交引导（DOG）策略，利用负向提示的正交投影来控制生成过程，采用三角形调度控制引导强度

Result: 在DiffusionPen和One-DM模型上验证，DOG在内外词汇和复杂风格下都显著提升了内容清晰度和风格多样性

Conclusion: DOG方法为扩散模型提供了更稳定的引导机制，有效解决了手写文本生成中的虫喷和风格适应性问题

Abstract: Diffusion-based Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) approaches achieve
impressive results on frequent, in-vocabulary words observed at training time
and on regular styles. However, they are prone to memorizing training samples
and often struggle with style variability and generation clarity. In
particular, standard diffusion models tend to produce artifacts or distortions
that negatively affect the readability of the generated text, especially when
the style is hard to produce. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel
sampling guidance strategy, Dual Orthogonal Guidance (DOG), that leverages an
orthogonal projection of a negatively perturbed prompt onto the original
positive prompt. This approach helps steer the generation away from artifacts
while maintaining the intended content, and encourages more diverse, yet
plausible, outputs. Unlike standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which
relies on unconditional predictions and produces noise at high guidance scales,
DOG introduces a more stable, disentangled direction in the latent space. To
control the strength of the guidance across the denoising process, we apply a
triangular schedule: weak at the start and end of denoising, when the process
is most sensitive, and strongest in the middle steps. Experimental results on
the state-of-the-art DiffusionPen and One-DM demonstrate that DOG improves both
content clarity and style variability, even for out-of-vocabulary words and
challenging writing styles.

Method: 提出概率时序掩码注意力(PTMA)模型，利用概率建模获得跨视图下的潜在压缩表示，结合GRU-based时序掩码注意力单元进行视频序列查询，整合多视图信息提取视角不变特征

Result: 在DAHLIA、IKEA ASM和Breakfast数据集上，通过跨主体、跨视图和跨主体-视图三种评估协议验证，PTMA达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: PTMA模型通过概率建模和多视图信息整合，有效提升了在线动作检测在跨视图场景下的泛化能力和性能表现

Abstract: As a critical task in video sequence classification within computer vision,
Online Action Detection (OAD) has garnered significant attention. The
sensitivity of mainstream OAD models to varying video viewpoints often hampers
their generalization when confronted with unseen sources. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel Probabilistic Temporal Masked Attention (PTMA)
model, which leverages probabilistic modeling to derive latent compressed
representations of video frames in a cross-view setting. The PTMA model
incorporates a GRU-based temporal masked attention (TMA) cell, which leverages
these representations to effectively query the input video sequence, thereby
enhancing information interaction and facilitating autoregressive frame-level
video analysis. Additionally, multi-view information can be integrated into the
probabilistic modeling to facilitate the extraction of view-invariant features.
Experiments conducted under three evaluation protocols: cross-subject (cs),
cross-view (cv), and cross-subject-view (csv) show that PTMA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the DAHLIA, IKEA ASM, and Breakfast datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的局部聚焦机制(LFM)来解决深度伪造检测中的泛化问题，通过显式关注判别性局部特征，在准确率和效率方面都超越了现有最佳方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于重建学习的深度伪造检测方法在跨物体类别和生成域时泛化能力差，主要原因是深度CNN容易过拟合语义特征分布，以及全局平均池化丢失了关键的局部伪造线索。

Method: 提出了局部聚焦机制(LFM)，包含显著性网络(SNet)和任务特定的Top-K池化(TKP)模块来选择最具信息量的局部模式，并引入了基于排名的线性dropout(RBLD)和随机K采样(RKS)两种正则化技术来防止过拟合。

Result: LFM在准确率上比最先进的NPR方法提高了3.7%，平均精度提高了2.8%，同时在单块NVIDIA A6000 GPU上保持了1789 FPS的卓越效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为跨域深度伪造检测设立了新的基准，通过关注局部特征显著提升了检测性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deepfake generation techniques has intensified the
need for robust and generalizable detection methods. Existing approaches based
on reconstruction learning typically leverage deep convolutional networks to
extract differential features. However, these methods show poor generalization
across object categories (e.g., from faces to cars) and generation domains
(e.g., from GANs to Stable Diffusion), due to intrinsic limitations of deep
CNNs. First, models trained on a specific category tend to overfit to semantic
feature distributions, making them less transferable to other categories,
especially as network depth increases. Second, Global Average Pooling (GAP)
compresses critical local forgery cues into a single vector, thus discarding
discriminative patterns vital for real-fake classification. To address these
issues, we propose a novel Local Focus Mechanism (LFM) that explicitly attends
to discriminative local features for differentiating fake from real images. LFM
integrates a Salience Network (SNet) with a task-specific Top-K Pooling (TKP)
module to select the K most informative local patterns. To mitigate potential
overfitting introduced by Top-K pooling, we introduce two regularization
techniques: Rank-Based Linear Dropout (RBLD) and Random-K Sampling (RKS), which
enhance the model's robustness. LFM achieves a 3.7 improvement in accuracy and
a 2.8 increase in average precision over the state-of-the-art Neighboring Pixel
Relationships (NPR) method, while maintaining exceptional efficiency at 1789
FPS on a single NVIDIA A6000 GPU. Our approach sets a new benchmark for
cross-domain deepfake detection. The source code are available in

Abstract: The proliferation of digital food content has intensified the need for robust
and accurate systems capable of fine-grained visual understanding and
retrieval. In this work, we address the challenging task of food image-to-text
matching, a critical component in applications such as dietary monitoring,
smart kitchens, and restaurant automation. We propose F4-ITS: Fine-grained
Feature Fusion for Food Image-Text Search, a training-free, vision-language
model (VLM)-guided framework that significantly improves retrieval performance
through enhanced multi-modal feature representations. Our approach introduces
two key contributions: (1) a uni-directional(and bi-directional) multi-modal
fusion strategy that combines image embeddings with VLM-generated textual
descriptions to improve query expressiveness, and (2) a novel feature-based
re-ranking mechanism for top-k retrieval, leveraging predicted food ingredients
to refine results and boost precision. Leveraging open-source image-text
encoders, we demonstrate substantial gains over standard baselines - achieving
~10% and ~7.7% improvements in top-1 retrieval under dense and sparse caption
scenarios, and a ~28.6% gain in top-k ingredient-level retrieval. Additionally,
we show that smaller models (e.g., ViT-B/32) can match or outperform larger
counterparts (e.g., ViT-H, ViT-G, ViT-bigG) when augmented with textual fusion,

Conclusion: PVNet通过扩散模型和点体素交互机制，有效解决了室外场景稀疏点云上采样问题，为下游3D感知任务提供了高质量点云数据

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene understanding in outdoor environments heavily relies on
high-quality point clouds. However, LiDAR-scanned data often suffer from
extreme sparsity, severely hindering downstream 3D perception tasks. Existing
point cloud upsampling methods primarily focus on individual objects, thus
demonstrating limited generalization capability for complex outdoor scenes. To
address this issue, we propose PVNet, a diffusion model-based point-voxel
interaction framework to perform LiDAR point cloud upsampling without dense
supervision. Specifically, we adopt the classifier-free guidance-based DDPMs to
guide the generation, in which we employ a sparse point cloud as the guiding
condition and the synthesized point clouds derived from its nearby frames as
the input. Moreover, we design a voxel completion module to refine and complete
the coarse voxel features for enriching the feature representation. In
addition, we propose a point-voxel interaction module to integrate features
from both points and voxels, which efficiently improves the environmental
perception capability of each upsampled point. To the best of our knowledge,
our approach is the first scene-level point cloud upsampling method supporting
arbitrary upsampling rates. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The source
code will be available at https://github.com/chengxianjing/PVNet.

Conclusion: DeltaFlow通过高效的时序特征提取和创新的损失函数设计，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了场景流估计的精度和泛化能力。

Abstract: Previous dominant methods for scene flow estimation focus mainly on input
from two consecutive frames, neglecting valuable information in the temporal
domain. While recent trends shift towards multi-frame reasoning, they suffer
from rapidly escalating computational costs as the number of frames grows. To
leverage temporal information more efficiently, we propose DeltaFlow
($\Delta$Flow), a lightweight 3D framework that captures motion cues via a
$\Delta$ scheme, extracting temporal features with minimal computational cost,
regardless of the number of frames. Additionally, scene flow estimation faces
challenges such as imbalanced object class distributions and motion
inconsistency. To tackle these issues, we introduce a Category-Balanced Loss to
enhance learning across underrepresented classes and an Instance Consistency
Loss to enforce coherent object motion, improving flow accuracy. Extensive
evaluations on the Argoverse 2 and Waymo datasets show that $\Delta$Flow
achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 22% lower error and $2\times$
faster inference compared to the next-best multi-frame supervised method, while
also demonstrating a strong cross-domain generalization ability. The code is

Conclusion: REGEN框架成功实现了高效的实时照相实感增强，为游戏影音效果提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Photorealism is an important aspect of modern video games since it can shape
the player experience and simultaneously impact the immersion, narrative
engagement, and visual fidelity. Although recent hardware technological
breakthroughs, along with state-of-the-art rendering technologies, have
significantly improved the visual realism of video games, achieving true
photorealism in dynamic environments at real-time frame rates still remains a
major challenge due to the tradeoff between visual quality and performance. In
this short paper, we present a novel approach for enhancing the photorealism of
rendered game frames using generative adversarial networks. To this end, we
propose Real-time photorealism Enhancement in Games via a dual-stage gEnerative
Network framework (REGEN), which employs a robust unpaired image-to-image
translation model to produce semantically consistent photorealistic frames that
transform the problem into a simpler paired image-to-image translation task.
This enables training with a lightweight method that can achieve real-time
inference time without compromising visual quality. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework on Grand Theft Auto V, showing that the approach
achieves visual results comparable to the ones produced by the robust unpaired
Im2Im method while improving inference speed by 32.14 times. Our findings also
indicate that the results outperform the photorealism-enhanced frames produced
by directly training a lightweight unpaired Im2Im translation method to
translate the video game frames towards the visual characteristics of
real-world images. Code, pre-trained models, and demos for this work are
available at: https://github.com/stefanos50/REGEN.

*Peng Hu,Yu Gu,Liang Luo,Fuji Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSG-DiT是一个新颖的可控视频生成框架，通过空间信号引导和双阶段解耦过程，显著提升了生成视频与文本提示的语义一致性，在VBench基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控视频生成模型在保持语义一致性方面存在困难，经常生成与提示细节不符的视频内容，需要解决这一关键挑战。

Method: 提出SSG-DiT框架，包含两个阶段：1）空间信号提示阶段利用预训练多模态模型生成空间感知视觉提示；2）通过轻量级SSG-Adapter将联合条件注入冻结的视频DiT主干，采用双分支注意力机制同时利用生成先验和外部空间信号。

Result: 在VBench基准测试的多个关键指标上超越现有模型，特别是在空间关系控制和整体一致性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: SSG-DiT通过空间信号引导和参数高效的适配器设计，有效解决了可控视频生成中的语义一致性问题，为高质量视频合成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Controllable video generation aims to synthesize video content that aligns
precisely with user-provided conditions, such as text descriptions and initial
images. However, a significant challenge persists in this domain: existing
models often struggle to maintain strong semantic consistency, frequently
generating videos that deviate from the nuanced details specified in the
prompts. To address this issue, we propose SSG-DiT (Spatial Signal Guided
Diffusion Transformer), a novel and efficient framework for high-fidelity
controllable video generation. Our approach introduces a decoupled two-stage
process. The first stage, Spatial Signal Prompting, generates a spatially aware
visual prompt by leveraging the rich internal representations of a pre-trained
multi-modal model. This prompt, combined with the original text, forms a joint
condition that is then injected into a frozen video DiT backbone via our
lightweight and parameter-efficient SSG-Adapter. This unique design, featuring
a dual-branch attention mechanism, allows the model to simultaneously harness
its powerful generative priors while being precisely steered by external
spatial signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSG-DiT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing models on multiple key
metrics in the VBench benchmark, particularly in spatial relationship control
and overall consistency.

### [168] [Proximal Vision Transformer: Enhancing Feature Representation through Two-Stage Manifold Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17081)
*Haoyu Yun,Hamid Krim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将Vision Transformer与近端工具相结合的新框架，通过几何优化方法增强特征表示和分类性能，解决了ViT在全局几何关系建模方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformer虽然通过自注意力机制在计算机视觉任务中表现出色，但其优化仅限于建模单个图像内的局部关系，无法捕捉数据点之间的全局几何关系，这限制了其性能。

Method: 提出将ViT与近端工具集成的框架：ViT通过自注意力机制构建流形的切丛（每个注意力头对应一个切空间），然后引入近端迭代来定义切丛中的截面并将数据从切空间投影到基空间，实现全局特征对齐和优化。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在分类准确率和数据分布方面优于传统的Vision Transformer模型。

Conclusion: 该框架通过几何优化方法成功增强了ViT的特征表示能力，证明了整合几何工具可以有效提升Transformer架构在计算机视觉任务中的性能。

Abstract: The Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture has become widely recognized in
computer vision, leveraging its self-attention mechanism to achieve remarkable
success across various tasks. Despite its strengths, ViT's optimization remains
confined to modeling local relationships within individual images, limiting its
ability to capture the global geometric relationships between data points. To
address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel framework that integrates
ViT with the proximal tools, enabling a unified geometric optimization approach
to enhance feature representation and classification performance. In this
framework, ViT constructs the tangent bundle of the manifold through its
self-attention mechanism, where each attention head corresponds to a tangent
space, offering geometric representations from diverse local perspectives.
Proximal iterations are then introduced to define sections within the tangent
bundle and project data from tangent spaces onto the base space, achieving
global feature alignment and optimization. Experimental results confirm that
the proposed method outperforms traditional ViT in terms of classification
accuracy and data distribution.

*Pedro Silva,Guilherme A. L. Silva,Pablo Coelho,Vander Freitas,Gladston Moreira,David Menotii,Eduardo Luz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Proxy-Decidability Loss (PD-Loss)，结合可学习代理和可决策性指数d'来优化深度度量学习的嵌入空间，在保持计算效率的同时提升分布可分性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度度量学习方法存在局限性：成对损失需要复杂采样且收敛慢，基于代理的方法难以优化全局分布特性，而基于可决策性指数的D-Loss又需要大批量训练计算成本高。

Method: 通过代理估计真实分布和冒名分布，将可学习代理与统计框架d'相结合，在保持代理方法计算效率的同时优化嵌入空间的分布可分性。

Result: 在细粒度分类和人脸验证等任务上，PD-Loss达到了与最先进方法相当的性能，同时提供了新的嵌入优化视角。

Conclusion: PD-Loss成功结合了代理方法的计算效率和基于统计的分布可分性优化，为深度度量学习提供了可扩展的分布感知方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Deep Metric Learning (DML) aims to learn embedding functions that map
semantically similar inputs to proximate points in a metric space while
separating dissimilar ones. Existing methods, such as pairwise losses, are
hindered by complex sampling requirements and slow convergence. In contrast,
proxy-based losses, despite their improved scalability, often fail to optimize
global distribution properties. The Decidability-based Loss (D-Loss) addresses
this by targeting the decidability index (d') to enhance distribution
separability, but its reliance on large mini-batches imposes significant
computational constraints. We introduce Proxy-Decidability Loss (PD-Loss), a
novel objective that integrates learnable proxies with the statistical
framework of d' to optimize embedding spaces efficiently. By estimating genuine
and impostor distributions through proxies, PD-Loss combines the computational
efficiency of proxy-based methods with the principled separability of D-Loss,
offering a scalable approach to distribution-aware DML. Experiments across
various tasks, including fine-grained classification and face verification,
demonstrate that PD-Loss achieves performance comparable to that of
state-of-the-art methods while introducing a new perspective on embedding
optimization, with potential for broader applications.

TL;DR: GRASP是一个基于强化学习的空间像素推理框架，通过多模态大语言模型生成边界框和点提示，再由预训练分割模型生成掩码，无需掩码监督，在域内外数据上均取得显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM系统需要密集像素监督训练，成本高昂且在域外数据上表现不佳，需要一种更高效且泛化能力强的解决方案

Method: 采用结构化策略学习框架：MLLM生成边界框和正点作为提示，预训练分割模型生成最终掩码；使用GRPO强化学习优化，仅需格式奖励和精度奖励，无需掩码监督

Result: 在域内测试集上提升约4%，在域外基准测试上提升高达54%，证明了强大的泛化能力

Conclusion: 复杂的地理空间分割行为可以通过强化学习从弱空间线索中学习，该方法利用基础模型的强先验，最小化可训练参数，并能从廉价标注中学习

Abstract: Geospatial pixel reasoning is a nascent remote-sensing task that aims to
generate segmentation masks directly from natural-language instructions.
Prevailing MLLM-based systems co-train a language model and a mask decoder with
dense pixel supervision, which is expensive and often weak on out-of-domain
(OOD) data. We introduce GRASP, a structured policy-learning framework. In our
design, a multimodal large language model first emits task-relevant bounding
boxes and positive points from a vision-language instruction. These outputs are
then passed to a pre-trained segmentation model, which consumes them as prompts
to generate the final mask. Instead of supervised fine-tuning, we optimize the
system purely with reinforcement learning: the model is trained solely with
GRPO, guided by format rewards and accuracy rewards computed on boxes and
points (no mask supervision). This leverages strong priors in foundation
models, minimizes trainable parameters, and enables learning from inexpensive
annotations. We additionally curate GRASP-1k, which contains
reasoning-intensive queries, detailed reasoning traces, and fine-grained
segmentation annotations. Evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain test
sets show state-of-the-art results: about 4% improvement in-domain and up to
54% on OOD benchmarks. The experiment results evidence our model's robust
generalization and demonstrate that complex geospatial segmentation behaviors
can be learned via RL from weak spatial cues. Code and the dataset will be
released open-source.

Motivation: 解决低资源地区甘蔗叶病诊断工具缺乏的问题，现有深度学习模型在真实条件下泛化能力差且计算资源需求高

Method: 构建包含638张图像的甘蔗叶病数据集，结合其他数据集增强多样性；开发优化的轻量级模型SugarcaneShuffleNet，并与其他5种轻量CNN模型进行对比；集成到渐进式Web应用中提供Grad-CAM解释

Result: SugarcaneShuffleNet模型仅9.26MB，达到98.02%准确率和0.98 F1分数，单图推理时间4.14ms，在速度和准确性间取得最佳平衡

Conclusion: 为甘蔗病害分类提供了多样化基准、适合低资源环境的高效模型和实用工具，支持不同光照、背景和设备的田间应用

Abstract: Despite progress in AI-based plant diagnostics, sugarcane farmers in
low-resource regions remain vulnerable to leaf diseases due to the lack of
scalable, efficient, and interpretable tools. Many deep learning models fail to
generalize under real-world conditions and require substantial computational
resources, limiting their use in resource-constrained regions. In this paper,
we present SugarcaneLD-BD, a curated dataset for sugarcane leaf-disease
classification; SugarcaneShuffleNet, an optimized lightweight model for rapid
on-device diagnosis; and SugarcaneAI, a Progressive Web Application for field
deployment. SugarcaneLD-BD contains 638 curated images across five classes,
including four major sugarcane diseases, collected in Bangladesh under diverse
field conditions and verified by expert pathologists. To enhance diversity, we
combined SugarcaneLD-BD with two additional datasets, yielding a larger and
more representative corpus. Our optimized model, SugarcaneShuffleNet, offers
the best trade-off between speed and accuracy for real-time, on-device
diagnosis. This 9.26 MB model achieved 98.02% accuracy, an F1-score of 0.98,
and an average inference time of 4.14 ms per image. For comparison, we
fine-tuned five other lightweight convolutional neural networks: MnasNet,
EdgeNeXt, EfficientNet-Lite, MobileNet, and SqueezeNet via transfer learning
and Bayesian optimization. MnasNet and EdgeNeXt achieved comparable accuracy to
SugarcaneShuffleNet, but required significantly more parameters, memory, and
computation, limiting their suitability for low-resource deployment. We
integrate SugarcaneShuffleNet into SugarcaneAI, delivering Grad-CAM-based
explanations in the field. Together, these contributions offer a diverse
benchmark, efficient models for low-resource environments, and a practical tool
for sugarcane disease classification. It spans varied lighting, backgrounds and
devices used on-farm

Method: 开发了四核心创新：1)平滑边界CNN集成Transformer(SBCIT)；2)定制残差空间学习CNN；3)通道增强策略；4)新型空间注意力机制。通过stem卷积和上下文交互transformer块实现高效全局特征建模

Result: 在Kaggle和Figshare的MRI数据集（包含胶质瘤、脑膜瘤、垂体瘤和健康对照）上评估，达到98.30%准确率、98.08%灵敏度、98.25% F1分数和98.43%精确度

Conclusion: CE-RS-SBCIT框架通过整合局部细粒度和全局上下文线索，有效解决了脑肿瘤MRI分类中的挑战，表现出卓越性能

Abstract: Brain tumors remain among the most lethal human diseases, where early
detection and accurate classification are critical for effective diagnosis and
treatment planning. Although deep learning-based computer-aided diagnostic
(CADx) systems have shown remarkable progress. However, conventional
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers face persistent
challenges, including high computational cost, sensitivity to minor contrast
variations, structural heterogeneity, and texture inconsistencies in MRI data.
Therefore, a novel hybrid framework, CE-RS-SBCIT, is introduced, integrating
residual and spatial learning-based CNNs with transformer-driven modules. The
proposed framework exploits local fine-grained and global contextual cues
through four core innovations: (i) a smoothing and boundary-based
CNN-integrated Transformer (SBCIT), (ii) tailored residual and spatial learning
CNNs, (iii) a channel enhancement (CE) strategy, and (iv) a novel spatial
attention mechanism. The developed SBCIT employs stem convolution and
contextual interaction transformer blocks with systematic smoothing and
boundary operations, enabling efficient global feature modeling. Moreover,
Residual and spatial CNNs, enhanced by auxiliary transfer-learned feature maps,
enrich the representation space, while the CE module amplifies discriminative
channels and mitigates redundancy. Furthermore, the spatial attention mechanism
selectively emphasizes subtle contrast and textural variations across tumor
classes. Extensive evaluation on challenging MRI datasets from Kaggle and
Figshare, encompassing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and healthy
controls, demonstrates superior performance, achieving 98.30% accuracy, 98.08%
sensitivity, 98.25% F1-score, and 98.43% precision.

Motivation: 由于T2加权MRI的各向异性分辨率限制，难以准确提取内侧颞叶皮质亚区厚度，需要开发更精确的分割方法来改善AD诊断和追踪

Method: 采用隐式神经表示方法，结合T1和T2加权MRI的分辨率优势，将各向异性空间的MTL亚区图谱上采样到各向同性空间，建立多模态高分辨率图谱集，并基于此开发各向同性MTL亚区分割模型

Conclusion: 该方法在不增加图谱标注工作量的情况下提高了AD成像生物标志物的准确性，有助于更精确地量化AD与脑萎缩的关系，为疾病追踪提供更准确的测量指标

Abstract: Imaging biomarkers in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are important tools
for diagnosing and tracking Alzheimer's disease (AD). As medial temporal lobe
(MTL) is the earliest region to show AD-related hallmarks, brain atrophy caused
by AD can first be observed in the MTL. Accurate segmentation of MTL subregions
and extraction of imaging biomarkers from them are important. However, due to
imaging limitations, the resolution of T2-weighted (T2w) MRI is anisotropic,
which makes it difficult to accurately extract the thickness of cortical
subregions in the MTL. In this study, we used an implicit neural representation
method to combine the resolution advantages of T1-weighted and T2w MRI to
accurately upsample an MTL subregion atlas set from anisotropic space to
isotropic space, establishing a multi-modality, high-resolution atlas set.
Based on this atlas, we developed an isotropic MTL subregion segmentation
model. In an independent test set, the cortical subregion thickness extracted
using this isotropic model showed higher significance than an anisotropic
method in distinguishing between participants with mild cognitive impairment
and cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants. In longitudinal analysis, the
biomarkers extracted using isotropic method showed greater stability in CU
participants. This study improved the accuracy of AD imaging biomarkers without
increasing the amount of atlas annotation work, which may help to more
accurately quantify the relationship between AD and brain atrophy and provide
more accurate measures for disease tracking.

TL;DR: 本文提出Adversarial Class Prompting (AdvCP)方法解决弱监督变化检测中的背景噪声问题，通过对抗提示挖掘和样本校正来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弱监督变化检测(WSCD)仅依赖图像级标签，但容易将背景变化误判为目标变化，特别是在复杂遥感场景中。需要解决这种共现噪声问题。

Method: AdvCP包含两个阶段：1) 对抗提示挖掘 - 使用错误标签激活错误特征映射，挖掘易被误分类的背景变化特征；2) 对抗样本校正 - 构建在线全局原型，整合对抗样本进行训练。

Result: 在ConvNet、Transformer和SAM基线上实验显示性能显著提升，且AdvCP可推广到其他多类弱监督密集预测场景。

Conclusion: AdvCP能有效解决WSCD中的背景噪声问题，无需增加推理成本，具有良好的通用性和实用性。

Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Change Detection (WSCD) aims to distinguish specific object
changes (e.g., objects appearing or disappearing) from background variations
(e.g., environmental changes due to light, weather, or seasonal shifts) in
paired satellite images, relying only on paired image (i.e., image-level)
classification labels. This technique significantly reduces the need for dense
annotations required in fully-supervised change detection. However, as
image-level supervision only indicates whether objects have changed in a scene,
WSCD methods often misclassify background variations as object changes,
especially in complex remote-sensing scenarios. In this work, we propose an
Adversarial Class Prompting (AdvCP) method to address this co-occurring noise
problem, including two phases: a) Adversarial Prompt Mining: After each
training iteration, we introduce adversarial prompting perturbations, using
incorrect one-hot image-level labels to activate erroneous feature mappings.
This process reveals co-occurring adversarial samples under weak supervision,
namely background variation features that are likely to be misclassified as
object changes. b) Adversarial Sample Rectification: We integrate these
adversarially prompt-activated pixel samples into training by constructing an
online global prototype. This prototype is built from an exponentially weighted
moving average of the current batch and all historical training data. Our AdvCP

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的多模态伪标注方法比仅考虑文本或仅考虑图像的伪标注方法构建的数据集更精确，生成的图像质量更高。

Conclusion: 多模态伪标注方法能够有效构建高质量的封面图像生成数据集，为同时生成文本摘要和视觉对应图像的任务提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel cover image generation task that produces
both a concise summary and a visually corresponding image from a given
text-only document. Because no existing datasets are available for this task,
we propose a multimodal pseudo-labeling method to construct high-quality
datasets at low cost. We first collect documents that contain multiple images
with their captions, and their summaries by excluding factually inconsistent
instances. Our approach selects one image from the multiple images accompanying
the documents. Using the gold summary, we independently rank both the images
and their captions. Then, we annotate a pseudo-label for an image when both the
image and its corresponding caption are ranked first in their respective
rankings. Finally, we remove documents that contain direct image references
within texts. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multimodal
pseudo-labeling method constructs more precise datasets and generates higher
quality images than text- and image-only pseudo-labeling methods, which
consider captions and images separately. We release our code at:

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于专家混合策略的多智能体高速公路场景理解框架，使用大VLM生成任务特定的思维链提示来指导小VLM进行多模态推理，实现了天气分类、路面湿度和交通拥堵检测等多任务处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决高速公路场景中多种关键感知任务（如天气状况、路面条件、交通流量）的实时监测需求，同时平衡计算效率和准确性，特别是在资源受限的环境中实现可靠的多任务推理。

Method: 采用混合专家策略：使用大型通用视觉语言模型（如GPT-4o）生成任务特定的思维链提示，然后用这些提示指导更小更高效的VLM（如Qwen2.5-VL-7B）对短视频和多模态数据进行推理。构建了三个专门的数据集支持验证，其中路面湿度数据集结合了视频流和道路天气传感器数据。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架在不同交通和环境条件下都表现出稳定强大的性能，能够有效处理多种感知任务，并在资源受限的环境中实现实时监控和预警。

Conclusion: 该多智能体框架能够与现有交通摄像头系统无缝集成，特别适用于高风险农村地区（如急弯、洪水易发低地或结冰桥梁）的持续监控，通过多模态推理提升态势感知能力并提供及时警报。

Abstract: This paper introduces a multi-agent framework for comprehensive highway scene
understanding, designed around a mixture-of-experts strategy. In this
framework, a large generic vision-language model (VLM), such as GPT-4o, is
contextualized with domain knowledge to generates task-specific
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts. These fine-grained prompts are then used to
guide a smaller, efficient VLM (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) in reasoning over short
videos, along with complementary modalities as applicable. The framework
simultaneously addresses multiple critical perception tasks, including weather
classification, pavement wetness assessment, and traffic congestion detection,
achieving robust multi-task reasoning while balancing accuracy and
computational efficiency. To support empirical validation, we curated three
specialized datasets aligned with these tasks. Notably, the pavement wetness
dataset is multimodal, combining video streams with road weather sensor data,
highlighting the benefits of multimodal reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate consistently strong performance across diverse traffic and
environmental conditions. From a deployment perspective, the framework can be
readily integrated with existing traffic camera systems and strategically
applied to high-risk rural locations, such as sharp curves, flood-prone
lowlands, or icy bridges. By continuously monitoring the targeted sites, the
system enhances situational awareness and delivers timely alerts, even in
resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多模态数据获取难题，在仅使用病理切片的情况下仍能实现高效的IHC预测，为临床应用提供了可行方案

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker prediction benefits from multi-modal data
fusion analysis. However, the simultaneous acquisition of multi-modal data,
such as genomic and pathological information, is often challenging due to cost
or technical limitations. To address this challenge, we propose an online
distillation approach based on Multi-modal Knowledge Decomposition (MKD) to
enhance IHC biomarker prediction in haematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) stained
histopathology images. This method leverages paired genomic-pathology data
during training while enabling inference using either pathology slides alone or
both modalities. Two teacher and one student models are developed to extract
modality-specific and modality-general features by minimizing the MKD loss. To
maintain the internal structural relationships between samples,
Similarity-preserving Knowledge Distillation (SKD) is applied. Additionally,
Collaborative Learning for Online Distillation (CLOD) facilitates mutual
learning between teacher and student models, encouraging diverse and
complementary learning dynamics. Experiments on the TCGA-BRCA and in-house QHSU
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in IHC
biomarker prediction using uni-modal data. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 注意力增强的CNN结合针对性损失优化和预处理，能够产生更具判别性的白血病细胞形态表征，为临床提供高效准确的自动化诊断工具

Abstract: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a prevalent hematological malignancy in
both pediatric and adult populations. Early and accurate detection with precise
subtyping is essential for guiding therapy. Conventional workflows are complex,
time-consuming, and prone to human error. We present a deep learning framework
for automated ALL diagnosis from bone marrow smear images. The method combines
a robust preprocessing pipeline with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
standardize image quality and improve inference efficiency. As a key design, we
insert a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) block into a VGG19 backbone to model
long-range dependencies and contextual relationships among cellular features.
To mitigate class imbalance, we train with Focal Loss. Across evaluated
architectures, the enhanced VGG19+MHSA trained with Focal Loss achieves 99.25%
accuracy, surpassing a strong ResNet101 baseline (98.62%). These results
indicate that attention-augmented CNNs, coupled with targeted loss optimization
and preprocessing, yield more discriminative representations of leukemic cell
morphology. Our approach offers a highly accurate and computationally efficient
tool for automated ALL recognition and subtyping, with potential to accelerate
diagnostic workflows and support reliable decision-making in clinical settings.

Motivation: 现有的视觉预训练表示主要基于2D图像，忽略了世界的3D本质，但由于大规模3D数据稀缺，难以从网络数据中提取通用3D表示

Method: 将视觉预训练目标构建为下一个点云预测问题，使用扩散模型作为预测模型，直接在大型公共数据集上进行预训练

Result: 在12个真实世界操作任务中，FVP将3D Diffusion Policy的平均成功率提升28%，达到模仿学习方法的最先进性能，且适用于不同点云编码器和数据集

Conclusion: FVP框架能够有效提升各种3D表示的性能，为机器人学习提供了强大的4D视觉预训练解决方案，并能扩展到更大的视觉-语言-动作模型

Abstract: General visual representations learned from web-scale datasets for robotics
have achieved great success in recent years, enabling data-efficient robot
learning on manipulation tasks; yet these pre-trained representations are
mostly on 2D images, neglecting the inherent 3D nature of the world. However,
due to the scarcity of large-scale 3D data, it is still hard to extract a
universal 3D representation from web datasets. Instead, we are seeking a
general visual pre-training framework that could improve all 3D representations
as an alternative. Our framework, called FVP, is a novel 4D Visual Pre-training
framework for real-world robot learning. FVP frames the visual pre-training
objective as a next-point-cloud-prediction problem, models the prediction model
as a diffusion model, and pre-trains the model on the larger public datasets
directly. Across twelve real-world manipulation tasks, FVP boosts the average
success rate of 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3) for these tasks by 28%. The FVP
pre-trained DP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance across imitation learning
methods. Moreover, the efficacy of FVP adapts across various point cloud
encoders and datasets. Finally, we apply FVP to the RDT-1B, a larger
Vision-Language-Action robotic model, enhancing its performance on various
robot tasks. Our project page is available at: https://4d-

TL;DR: PersPose是一个新的单目3D人体姿态估计框架，通过引入透视编码(PE)和透视旋转(PR)来解决裁剪图像中相机内参缺失和透视失真的问题，在多个数据集上达到了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D人体姿态估计方法通常只使用裁剪后的图像作为输入，但缺少相机内参信息导致无法准确估计关节的相对深度。此外，人体在原始图像中的位置偏移会导致透视失真，增加模型拟合难度。

Method: 提出PersPose框架：1) 透视编码(PE)来编码裁剪图像的相机内参；2) 透视旋转(PR)将人体主体居中，减少透视失真；3) 结合PE和PR构建完整的3D姿态估计模型。

Result: 在3DPW、MPI-INF-3DHP和Human3.6M数据集上达到最先进性能。特别是在3DPW数据集上，MPJPE达到60.1mm，比之前最佳方法降低了7.54%。

Conclusion: PersPose通过显式处理相机内参和透视失真问题，显著提升了单目3D人体姿态估计的精度，证明了考虑相机几何特性对于3D姿态估计的重要性。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) methods estimate the 3D positions of
joints from individual images. Existing 3D HPE approaches often use the cropped
image alone as input for their models. However, the relative depths of joints
cannot be accurately estimated from cropped images without the corresponding
camera intrinsics, which determine the perspective relationship between 3D
objects and the cropped images. In this work, we introduce Perspective Encoding
(PE) to encode the camera intrinsics of the cropped images. Moreover, since the
human subject can appear anywhere within the original image, the perspective
relationship between the 3D scene and the cropped image differs significantly,
which complicates model fitting. Additionally, the further the human subject
deviates from the image center, the greater the perspective distortions in the
cropped image. To address these issues, we propose Perspective Rotation (PR), a
transformation applied to the original image that centers the human subject,
thereby reducing perspective distortions and alleviating the difficulty of
model fitting. By incorporating PE and PR, we propose a novel 3D HPE framework,
PersPose. Experimental results demonstrate that PersPose achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the 3DPW, MPIINF-3DHP, and Human3.6M
datasets. For example, on the in-the-wild dataset 3DPW, PersPose achieves an
MPJPE of 60.1 mm, 7.54% lower than the previous SOTA approach. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoViPAL是一种层级的上下文视觉token剪枝方法，通过轻量级插件模块在LVLM处理前预测并移除冗余视觉token，显著提升推理效率而不损失精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型处理图像时产生大量视觉token，导致计算成本高和内存开销大。现有剪枝方法在浅层缺乏足够上下文信息时效果不佳，但许多视觉token在浅层就存在固有冗余。

Method: 提出CoViPAL方法，使用即插即用剪枝模块(PPM)在LVLM处理前预测和移除冗余视觉token。PPM轻量级、模型无关，可无缝集成到各种模型中。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，CoViPAL在相同token预算下优于无训练剪枝方法，在可比监督下超越基于训练的方法，显著提升推理效率。

Conclusion: CoViPAL为LVLMs提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案，在不影响准确性的前提下显著改善推理效率。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) process multimodal inputs consisting of
text tokens and vision tokens extracted from images or videos. Due to the rich
visual information, a single image can generate thousands of vision tokens,
leading to high computational costs during the prefilling stage and significant
memory overhead during decoding. Existing methods attempt to prune redundant
vision tokens, revealing substantial redundancy in visual representations.
However, these methods often struggle in shallow layers due to the lack of
sufficient contextual information. We argue that many visual tokens are
inherently redundant even in shallow layers and can be safely and effectively
pruned with appropriate contextual signals. In this work, we propose CoViPAL, a
layer-wise contextualized visual token pruning method that employs a
Plug-and-Play Pruning Module (PPM) to predict and remove redundant vision
tokens before they are processed by the LVLM. The PPM is lightweight,
model-agnostic, and operates independently of the LVLM architecture, ensuring
seamless integration with various models. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that CoViPAL outperforms training-free pruning methods
under equal token budgets and surpasses training-based methods with comparable
supervision. CoViPAL offers a scalable and efficient solution to improve
inference efficiency in LVLMs without compromising accuracy.

Motivation: 现有深度伪造主动取证方法基于单次水印嵌入的理想假设，但在实际场景中图像可能经历多次水印嵌入，导致原始取证水印被破坏，使整个防护机制失效。

Method: 提出对抗干扰模拟(AIS)训练范式，在微调过程中显式模拟MEA场景，并引入韧性驱动的损失函数来学习稀疏稳定的水印表示，而不需要修改网络架构。

Result: 大量实验表明，AIS训练范式显著增强了各种现有方法对MEA的鲁棒性，能够在水印二次嵌入后仍正确提取原始水印。

Conclusion: AIS是一种即插即用的通用训练方法，有效解决了多嵌入攻击问题，提升了深度伪造主动取证在实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of deepfake technologies and the wide dissemination
of digital media, personal privacy is facing increasingly serious security
threats. Deepfake proactive forensics, which involves embedding imperceptible
watermarks to enable reliable source tracking, serves as a crucial defense
against these threats. Although existing methods show strong forensic ability,
they rely on an idealized assumption of single watermark embedding, which
proves impractical in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we formally define
and demonstrate the existence of Multi-Embedding Attacks (MEA) for the first
time. When a previously protected image undergoes additional rounds of
watermark embedding, the original forensic watermark can be destroyed or
removed, rendering the entire proactive forensic mechanism ineffective. To
address this vulnerability, we propose a general training paradigm named
Adversarial Interference Simulation (AIS). Rather than modifying the network
architecture, AIS explicitly simulates MEA scenarios during fine-tuning and
introduces a resilience-driven loss function to enforce the learning of sparse
and stable watermark representations. Our method enables the model to maintain
the ability to extract the original watermark correctly even after a second
embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our plug-and-play AIS
training paradigm significantly enhances the robustness of various existing
methods against MEA.

Motivation: 当前深度神经网络在真实任务中表现优异，但无法像人类一样感知错觉轮廓（如abutting grating），这种感知差异阻碍了机器智能与人类认知的对齐。

Method: 受视觉皮层回路启发，设计ICPNet网络：1）多尺度特征投影模块提取多尺度表示；2）特征交互注意力模块增强前馈和反馈特征交互；3）边缘融合模块通过边缘检测任务注入形状约束，使网络关注前景。

Result: 在AG-MNIST和新建的AG-Fashion-MNIST测试集上，ICPNet对错觉轮廓的敏感性显著优于最先进模型，在各种子集上的top-1准确率都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该工作推动了基于DNN的模型向人类水平智能迈进一步，通过模拟人类视觉感知机制解决了深度神经网络在错觉轮廓感知方面的局限性。

Abstract: Higher levels of machine intelligence demand alignment with human perception
and cognition. Deep neural networks (DNN) dominated machine intelligence have
demonstrated exceptional performance across various real-world tasks.
Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that DNNs fail to perceive illusory
contours like the abutting grating, a discrepancy that misaligns with human
perception patterns. Departing from previous works, we propose a novel deep
network called illusory contour perception network (ICPNet) inspired by the
circuits of the visual cortex. In ICPNet, a multi-scale feature projection
(MFP) module is designed to extract multi-scale representations. To boost the
interaction between feedforward and feedback features, a feature interaction
attention module (FIAM) is introduced. Moreover, drawing inspiration from the
shape bias observed in human perception, an edge detection task conducted via
the edge fusion module (EFM) injects shape constraints that guide the network
to concentrate on the foreground. We assess our method on the existing AG-MNIST
test set and the AG-Fashion-MNIST test sets constructed by this work.
Comprehensive experimental results reveal that ICPNet is significantly more
sensitive to abutting grating illusory contours than state-of-the-art models,
with notable improvements in top-1 accuracy across various subsets. This work
is expected to make a step towards human-level intelligence for DNN-based
models.

Conclusion: SEER-VAR为基于LLM的驾驶AR推荐系统提供了有效基础，是首个探索这一方向的研究之一，代码和数据集将开源以支持未来研究。

Abstract: We present SEER-VAR, a novel framework for egocentric vehicle-based augmented
reality (AR) that unifies semantic decomposition, Context-Aware SLAM Branches
(CASB), and LLM-driven recommendation. Unlike existing systems that assume
static or single-view settings, SEER-VAR dynamically separates cabin and road
scenes via depth-guided vision-language grounding. Two SLAM branches track
egocentric motion in each context, while a GPT-based module generates
context-aware overlays such as dashboard cues and hazard alerts. To support
evaluation, we introduce EgoSLAM-Drive, a real-world dataset featuring
synchronized egocentric views, 6DoF ground-truth poses, and AR annotations
across diverse driving scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that SEER-VAR
achieves robust spatial alignment and perceptually coherent AR rendering across
varied environments. As one of the first to explore LLM-based AR recommendation
in egocentric driving, we address the lack of comparable systems through
structured prompting and detailed user studies. Results show that SEER-VAR
enhances perceived scene understanding, overlay relevance, and driver ease,
providing an effective foundation for future research in this direction. Code

Abstract: Identifying quantum flakes is crucial for scalable quantum hardware; however,
automated layer classification from optical microscopy remains challenging due
to substantial appearance shifts across different materials. In this paper, we
propose a new Continual-Learning Framework for Flake Layer Classification
(CLIFF). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of continual
learning in the domain of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Our method enables
the model to differentiate between materials and their physical and optical
properties by freezing a backbone and base head trained on a reference
material. For each new material, it learns a material-specific prompt,
embedding, and a delta head. A prompt pool and a cosine-similarity gate
modulate features and compute material-specific corrections. Additionally, we
incorporate memory replay with knowledge distillation. CLIFF achieves
competitive accuracy with significantly lower forgetting than naive fine-tuning
and a prompt-based baseline.

Conclusion: AdaGAT方法通过动态调整引导模型训练状态，有效提升了学生模型的对抗鲁棒性能

Abstract: Adversarial distillation (AD) is a knowledge distillation technique that
facilitates the transfer of robustness from teacher deep neural network (DNN)
models to lightweight target (student) DNN models, enabling the target models
to perform better than only training the student model independently. Some
previous works focus on using a small, learnable teacher (guide) model to
improve the robustness of a student model. Since a learnable guide model starts
learning from scratch, maintaining its optimal state for effective knowledge
transfer during co-training is challenging. Therefore, we propose a novel
Adaptive Guidance Adversarial Training (AdaGAT) method. Our method, AdaGAT,
dynamically adjusts the training state of the guide model to install robustness
to the target model. Specifically, we develop two separate loss functions as
part of the AdaGAT method, allowing the guide model to participate more
actively in backpropagation to achieve its optimal state. We evaluated our
approach via extensive experiments on three datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
TinyImageNet, using the WideResNet-34-10 model as the target model. Our
observations reveal that appropriately adjusting the guide model within a
certain accuracy range enhances the target model's robustness across various
adversarial attacks compared to a variety of baseline models.

Result: 实验结果表明该方法优于基于图像人-物交互检测、视频视觉关系检测和视频人-物交互识别的最先进方法生成的基线

Conclusion: ST-HOID任务对于视频理解具有重要意义，所提出的方法在该任务上表现出色，为视频人-物交互分析提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new instance-level human-object interaction
detection task on videos called ST-HOID, which aims to distinguish fine-grained
human-object interactions (HOIs) and the trajectories of subjects and objects.
It is motivated by the fact that HOI is crucial for human-centric video content
understanding. To solve ST-HOID, we propose a novel method consisting of an
object trajectory detection module and an interaction reasoning module.
Furthermore, we construct the first dataset named VidOR-HOID for ST-HOID
evaluation, which contains 10,831 spatial-temporal HOI instances. We conduct
extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. The
experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines
generated by the state-of-the-art methods of image human-object interaction
detection, video visual relation detection and video human-object interaction
recognition.

TL;DR: 开发深度学习模型来自动测量CT图像中的骨骼肌面积，实现肌少症的自动化评估和检测，平均误差±3个百分点，Dice相似系数达93%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肌少症与不良手术结果相关，但通过CT测量骨骼肌面积的过程耗时且增加临床工作量，限制了及时检测和管理，需要AI辅助提高效率。

Method: 采用迁移学习和自监督学习方法，利用标记和未标记的CT扫描数据集开发深度学习模型，定量评估骨骼肌面积。

Result: 模型预测骨骼肌面积的平均误差为±3个百分点，预测掩模的平均Dice相似系数达到93%。

Conclusion: 该方法为肌少症评估和检测的全自动化提供了可行途径，解决了类别不平衡和数据有限的问题，定量评估比定性检测更精确和信息丰富。

Abstract: Sarcopenia is a progressive loss of muscle mass and function linked to poor
surgical outcomes such as prolonged hospital stays, impaired mobility, and
increased mortality. Although it can be assessed through cross-sectional
imaging by measuring skeletal muscle area (SMA), the process is time-consuming
and adds to clinical workloads, limiting timely detection and management;
however, this process could become more efficient and scalable with the
assistance of artificial intelligence applications. This paper presents
high-quality three-dimensional cross-sectional computed tomography (CT) images
of patients with sarcopenia collected at the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon
Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Expert clinicians manually annotated the
SMA at the third lumbar vertebra, generating precise segmentation masks. We
develop deep-learning models to measure SMA in CT images and automate this
task. Our methodology employed transfer learning and self-supervised learning
approaches using labelled and unlabeled CT scan datasets. While we developed
qualitative assessment models for detecting sarcopenia, we observed that the
quantitative assessment of SMA is more precise and informative. This approach
also mitigates the issue of class imbalance and limited data availability. Our
model predicted the SMA, on average, with an error of +-3 percentage points
against the manually measured SMA. The average dice similarity coefficient of
the predicted masks was 93%. Our results, therefore, show a pathway to full
automation of sarcopenia assessment and detection.

*Ruichao Hou,Boyue Xu,Tongwei Ren,Gangshan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的多模态感知跟踪器MTNet，通过模态感知网络和Transformer融合网络来增强RGB-T跟踪的特征交互和全局依赖关系，实现了在三个RGBT基准测试上的优异性能和实时速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 常规的融合范式和不变的跟踪模板限制了RGB-T跟踪中的特征交互能力，需要学习更鲁棒的多模态表示。

Method: 提出MTNet跟踪器，包含模态感知网络（CADM通道聚合分布模块和SSPM空间相似性感知模块）、Transformer融合网络、三叉戟预测头和动态更新策略。

Result: 在三个RGBT基准测试上取得了令人满意的结果，达到了最先进竞争者的性能水平，同时实现了实时速度。

Conclusion: 该方法通过模态感知和Transformer融合有效提升了RGB-T跟踪的性能，证明了其在处理尺度变化和变形等挑战方面的有效性。

Abstract: The ability to learn robust multi-modality representation has played a
critical role in the development of RGBT tracking. However, the regular fusion
paradigm and the invariable tracking template remain restrictive to the feature
interaction. In this paper, we propose a modality-aware tracker based on
transformer, termed MTNet. Specifically, a modality-aware network is presented
to explore modality-specific cues, which contains both channel aggregation and
distribution module(CADM) and spatial similarity perception module (SSPM). A
transformer fusion network is then applied to capture global dependencies to
reinforce instance representations. To estimate the precise location and tackle
the challenges, such as scale variation and deformation, we design a trident
prediction head and a dynamic update strategy which jointly maintain a reliable
template for facilitating inter-frame communication. Extensive experiments
validate that the proposed method achieves satisfactory results compared with
the state-of-the-art competitors on three RGBT benchmarks while reaching
real-time speed.

Abstract: Foundation models like SAM (Segment Anything Model) exhibit strong zero-shot
image segmentation performance, but often fall short on domain-specific tasks.
Fine-tuning these models typically requires significant manual effort and
domain expertise. In this work, we introduce QTT-SEG, a meta-learning-driven
approach for automating and accelerating the fine-tuning of SAM for image
segmentation. Built on the Quick-Tune hyperparameter optimization framework,
QTT-SEG predicts high-performing configurations using meta-learned cost and
performance models, efficiently navigating a search space of over 200 million
possibilities. We evaluate QTT-SEG on eight binary and five multiclass
segmentation datasets under tight time constraints. Our results show that
QTT-SEG consistently improves upon SAM's zero-shot performance and surpasses
AutoGluon Multimodal, a strong AutoML baseline, on most binary tasks within
three minutes. On multiclass datasets, QTT-SEG delivers consistent gains as
well. These findings highlight the promise of meta-learning in automating model
adaptation for specialized segmentation tasks. Code available at:

Abstract: Compositional visual reasoning has emerged as a key research frontier in
multimodal AI, aiming to endow machines with the human-like ability to
decompose visual scenes, ground intermediate concepts, and perform multi-step
logical inference. While early surveys focus on monolithic vision-language
models or general multimodal reasoning, a dedicated synthesis of the rapidly
expanding compositional visual reasoning literature is still missing. We fill
this gap with a comprehensive survey spanning 2023 to 2025 that systematically
reviews 260+ papers from top venues (CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, etc.). We
first formalize core definitions and describe why compositional approaches
offer advantages in cognitive alignment, semantic fidelity, robustness,
interpretability, and data efficiency. Next, we trace a five-stage paradigm
shift: from prompt-enhanced language-centric pipelines, through tool-enhanced
LLMs and tool-enhanced VLMs, to recently minted chain-of-thought reasoning and
unified agentic VLMs, highlighting their architectural designs, strengths, and
limitations. We then catalog 60+ benchmarks and corresponding metrics that
probe compositional visual reasoning along dimensions such as grounding
accuracy, chain-of-thought faithfulness, and high-resolution perception.
Drawing on these analyses, we distill key insights, identify open challenges
(e.g., limitations of LLM-based reasoning, hallucination, a bias toward
deductive reasoning, scalable supervision, tool integration, and benchmark
limitations), and outline future directions, including world-model integration,
human-AI collaborative reasoning, and richer evaluation protocols. By offering
a unified taxonomy, historical roadmap, and critical outlook, this survey aims
to serve as a foundational reference and inspire the next generation of
compositional visual reasoning research.

*Zhihao Chen,Qi Gao,Zilong Li,Junping Zhang,Yi Zhang,Jun Zhao,Hongming Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoundDiff是一个基于扩散模型的基础性低剂量CT去噪方法，通过两阶段策略（剂量-解剖感知和自适应去噪）实现在不同剂量水平和解剖区域的统一去噪，展现出优异的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的低剂量CT去噪方法通常针对特定剂量水平和解剖区域训练，难以处理不同扫描条件下的噪声特征和解剖异质性，限制了其在临床场景中的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Method: 采用两阶段策略：1）开发剂量-解剖感知对比语言图像预训练模型（DA-CLIP），通过对比学习学习连续表示来量化剂量变化和识别解剖区域；2）设计剂量-解剖感知扩散模型（DA-Diff），通过基于Mamba的新型条件块（DACB）将学习到的嵌入整合到扩散过程中。

Result: 在两个公共LDCT数据集上的大量实验表明，FoundDiff在八个剂量水平和三个解剖区域上优于现有最先进方法，并对未见过的剂量水平表现出显著的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FoundDiff提供了一个统一且可泛化的低剂量CT去噪解决方案，通过有效的剂量和解剖感知机制，显著提升了在不同临床条件下的性能表现。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (CT) denoising is crucial for reduced radiation
exposure while ensuring diagnostically acceptable image quality. Despite
significant advancements driven by deep learning (DL) in recent years, existing
DL-based methods, typically trained on a specific dose level and anatomical
region, struggle to handle diverse noise characteristics and anatomical
heterogeneity during varied scanning conditions, limiting their
generalizability and robustness in clinical scenarios. In this paper, we
propose FoundDiff, a foundational diffusion model for unified and generalizable
LDCT denoising across various dose levels and anatomical regions. FoundDiff
employs a two-stage strategy: (i) dose-anatomy perception and (ii) adaptive
denoising. First, we develop a dose- and anatomy-aware contrastive language
image pre-training model (DA-CLIP) to achieve robust dose and anatomy
perception by leveraging specialized contrastive learning strategies to learn
continuous representations that quantify ordinal dose variations and identify
salient anatomical regions. Second, we design a dose- and anatomy-aware
diffusion model (DA-Diff) to perform adaptive and generalizable denoising by
synergistically integrating the learned dose and anatomy embeddings from DACLIP
into diffusion process via a novel dose and anatomy conditional block (DACB)
based on Mamba. Extensive experiments on two public LDCT datasets encompassing
eight dose levels and three anatomical regions demonstrate superior denoising
performance of FoundDiff over existing state-of-the-art methods and the
remarkable generalization to unseen dose levels. The codes and models are
available at https://github.com/hao1635/FoundDiff.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型规模扩大，训练成本急剧增加，需要开发无需训练且可扩展的图像编辑框架来实现定制化对象的无缝插入。

Method: 采用位置嵌入移植技术指导扩散模型复制参考对象的结构特征，结合角点中心布局将参考图像与背景图像拼接输入FLUX.1-Fill模型，在渐进去噪过程中引导目标区域噪声分布。

Result: 大量实验表明，PosBridge在结构一致性、外观保真度和计算效率方面均优于主流基线方法。

Conclusion: PosBridge框架具有实用价值和广泛应用潜力，为无需训练的定制化对象插入提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Localized subject-driven image editing aims to seamlessly integrate
user-specified objects into target scenes. As generative models continue to
scale, training becomes increasingly costly in terms of memory and computation,
highlighting the need for training-free and scalable editing frameworks.To this
end, we propose PosBridge an efficient and flexible framework for inserting
custom objects. A key component of our method is positional embedding
transplant, which guides the diffusion model to faithfully replicate the
structural characteristics of reference objects.Meanwhile, we introduce the
Corner Centered Layout, which concatenates reference images and the background
image as input to the FLUX.1-Fill model. During progressive denoising,
positional embedding transplant is applied to guide the noise distribution in
the target region toward that of the reference object. In this way, Corner
Centered Layout effectively directs the FLUX.1-Fill model to synthesize
identity-consistent content at the desired location. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PosBridge outperforms mainstream baselines in structural
consistency, appearance fidelity, and computational efficiency, showcasing its
practical value and potential for broad adoption.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了在MLCAS 2025小麦语义分割挑战赛中获得第一名的解决方案，通过针对小麦茎秆的特殊性设计了三个技术改进：动态上采样器SAPA、半监督引导蒸馏和测试时缩放策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前分割技巧已集成到现有代码库中，基线模型性能已足够好。通过可视化分析发现小麦茎秆是关键难点——具有精细结构、像素占比少、预测脆弱且存在类别不平衡问题。

Method: 1) 使用动态上采样器SAPA增强细节描绘；2) 采用半监督引导蒸馏配合茎秆感知样本选择挖掘未标注数据；3) 应用测试时缩放策略对图像进行两次分割。

Result: 该方法在比赛中获得第一名，明显优于第二名。

Conclusion: 针对特定问题的本质特征（如小麦茎秆的特殊性）进行定制化改进，比通用技巧更能提升性能，即使在基线模型已经很优秀的情况下。

Abstract: In this report, we present our solution during the participation of the MLCAS
2025 GWFSS Challenge. This challenge hosts a semantic segmentation competition
specific to wheat plants, which requires to segment three wheat organs
including the head, leaf, and stem, and another background class. In 2025,
participating a segmentation competition is significantly different from that
in previous years where many tricks can play important roles. Nowadays most
segmentation tricks have been well integrated into existing codebases such that
our naive ViT-Adapter baseline has already achieved sufficiently good
performance. Hence, we believe the key to stand out among other competitors is
to focus on the problem nature of wheat per se. By probing visualizations, we
identify the key -- the stem matters. In contrast to heads and leaves, stems
exhibit fine structure and occupy only few pixels, which suffers from fragile
predictions and class imbalance. Building on our baseline, we present three
technical improvements tailored to stems: i) incorporating a dynamic upsampler
SAPA used to enhance detail delineation; ii) leveraging semi-supervised guided
distillation with stem-aware sample selection to mine the treasure beneath
unlabeled data; and iii) applying a test-time scaling strategy to zoom in and
segment twice the image. Despite being simple, the three improvements bring us
to the first place of the competition, outperforming the second place by clear
margins. Code and models will be released at

Motivation: 现有Deepfake检测方法主要依赖被动分析，难以应对高质量伪造内容。主动防御通过在图像编辑前插入隐形信号来提前防御

Method: 利用局部二值模式(LBP)提取纹理特征，采用双模型注意力策略生成和优化纹理扰动，在低感知显著性的纹理区域插入局部扰动

Result: 在CelebA-HQ和LFW数据集上验证了方法的有效性，能够在多种攻击模型下扭曲Deepfake生成并产生明显视觉缺陷

Conclusion: 该方法为主动Deepfake检测提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案，通过纹理引导的扰动框架实现了对伪造内容的主动防御

Abstract: The rapid development of Deepfake technology poses severe challenges to
social trust and information security. While most existing detection methods
primarily rely on passive analyses, due to unresolvable high-quality Deepfake
contents, proactive defense has recently emerged by inserting invisible signals
in advance of image editing. In this paper, we introduce a proactive Deepfake
detection approach based on facial texture features. Since human eyes are more
sensitive to perturbations in smooth regions, we invisibly insert perturbations
within texture regions that have low perceptual saliency, applying localized
perturbations to key texture regions while minimizing unwanted noise in
non-textured areas. Our texture-guided perturbation framework first extracts
preliminary texture features via Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and then
introduces a dual-model attention strategy to generate and optimize texture
perturbations. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW datasets demonstrate the
promising performance of our method in distorting Deepfake generation and
producing obvious visual defects under multiple attack models, providing an
efficient and scalable solution for proactive Deepfake detection.

Motivation: 传统光谱提升方法只能将RGB图像转换为光谱图像，而SpecGen旨在从单张RGB图像生成光谱双向反射分布函数(BRDF)，实现任意光照和形状下的光谱图像渲染。

Method: 提出Spectral-Spatial Tri-plane Aggregation (SSTA)网络，建模波长和入射-出射方向的反射响应，利用丰富的RGB BRDF数据训练策略来增强光谱BRDF生成。

Result: 实验表明该方法从有限光谱数据中准确重建光谱BRDF，在高光谱图像重建方面超越最先进方法，PSNR提升8dB。

Conclusion: SpecGen通过创新的SSTA网络和训练策略，成功解决了光谱BRDF数据稀缺的问题，实现了高质量的光谱BRDF生成和渲染。

Abstract: Synthesizing spectral images across different wavelengths is essential for
photorealistic rendering. Unlike conventional spectral uplifting methods that
convert RGB images into spectral ones, we introduce SpecGen, a novel method
that generates spectral bidirectional reflectance distribution functions
(BRDFs) from a single RGB image of a sphere. This enables spectral image
rendering under arbitrary illuminations and shapes covered by the corresponding
material. A key challenge in spectral BRDF generation is the scarcity of
measured spectral BRDF data. To address this, we propose the Spectral-Spatial
Tri-plane Aggregation (SSTA) network, which models reflectance responses across
wavelengths and incident-outgoing directions, allowing the training strategy to
leverage abundant RGB BRDF data to enhance spectral BRDF generation.
Experiments show that our method accurately reconstructs spectral BRDFs from
limited spectral data and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in hyperspectral
image reconstruction, achieving an improvement of 8 dB in PSNR. Codes and data
will be released upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉问答基准在结构化表格图像、数值推理和跨语言泛化方面的评估不足，特别是在板球记分卡这种半结构化数据上，需要专门的基准来测试大视觉语言模型的这些能力。

Abstract: We introduce MMCRICBENCH-3K, a benchmark for Visual Question Answering (VQA)
on cricket scorecards, designed to evaluate large vision-language models
(LVLMs) on complex numerical and cross-lingual reasoning over semi-structured
tabular images. MMCRICBENCH-3K comprises 1,463 synthetically generated

scorecards, and MMCRICBENCH-H-1.5K, containing visually similar Hindi
scorecards, with all questions and answers kept in English to enable controlled
cross-script evaluation. The task demands reasoning over structured numerical
data, multi-image context, and implicit domain knowledge. Empirical results
show that even state-of-the-art LVLMs, such as GPT-4o and Qwen2.5VL, struggle
on the English subset despite it being their primary training language and
exhibit a further drop in performance on the Hindi subset. This reveals key
limitations in structure-aware visual text understanding, numerical reasoning,
and cross-lingual generalization. The dataset is publicly available via Hugging

Result: 在Chameleon数据集上准确率提升超过13%，在HiRes-50K数据集上提升10%

Conclusion: HiDA-Net能有效保留原生分辨率细节，显著提升高分辨率AI生成图像检测性能

Abstract: The rapid growth of high-resolution, meticulously crafted AI-generated images
poses a significant challenge to existing detection methods, which are often
trained and evaluated on low-resolution, automatically generated datasets that
do not align with the complexities of high-resolution scenarios. A common
practice is to resize or center-crop high-resolution images to fit standard
network inputs. However, without full coverage of all pixels, such strategies
risk either obscuring subtle, high-frequency artifacts or discarding
information from uncovered regions, leading to input information loss. In this
paper, we introduce the High-Resolution Detail-Aggregation Network (HiDA-Net),
a novel framework that ensures no pixel is left behind. We use the Feature
Aggregation Module (FAM), which fuses features from multiple full-resolution
local tiles with a down-sampled global view of the image. These local features
are aggregated and fused with global representations for final prediction,
ensuring that native-resolution details are preserved and utilized for
detection. To enhance robustness against challenges such as localized AI
manipulations and compression, we introduce Token-wise Forgery Localization
(TFL) module for fine-grained spatial sensitivity and JPEG Quality Factor
Estimation (QFE) module to disentangle generative artifacts from compression
noise explicitly. Furthermore, to facilitate future research, we introduce
HiRes-50K, a new challenging benchmark consisting of 50,568 images with up to
64 megapixels. Extensive experiments show that HiDA-Net achieves
state-of-the-art, increasing accuracy by over 13% on the challenging Chameleon

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiCache是一种无需训练的自适应缓存策略，通过浅层在线探针实时分析扩散模型特征变化模式，自动决定缓存时机并动态对齐多步缓存轨迹，显著提升扩散模型加速效率并保持视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于缓存的扩散模型加速方法依赖预定义经验法则或数据集级先验，在高度动态的扩散过程中泛化性有限，对异常样本表现不佳。研究发现浅层特征差异变化模式与最终输出变化高度相关，不同层特征形成相似轨迹。

Method: DiCache包含两个核心组件：1) 在线探针分析方案利用浅层在线探针实时获取缓存误差稳定先验，自主确定缓存时机；2) 动态缓存轨迹对齐基于浅层探针特征轨迹组合多步缓存，更好近似当前特征。

Result: 在多种领先扩散模型（WAN 2.1、HunyuanVideo视频生成、Flux图像生成）上的大量实验验证了DiCache在实现更高效率和改进视觉保真度方面优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: DiCache通过揭示浅层特征变化模式与最终输出的强相关性，提出了统一的训练免费自适应缓存框架，有效解决了扩散模型加速中的"何时缓存"和"如何使用缓存"两个基本问题。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of acceleration techniques
for diffusion models, especially caching-based acceleration methods. These
studies seek to answer two fundamental questions: "When to cache" and "How to
use cache", typically relying on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level
priors to determine the timing of caching and utilizing handcrafted rules for
leveraging multi-step caches. However, given the highly dynamic nature of the
diffusion process, they often exhibit limited generalizability and fail on
outlier samples. In this paper, a strong correlation is revealed between the
variation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion
model and those of final model outputs. Moreover, we have observed that the
features from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these
observations, we present DiCache, a novel training-free adaptive caching
strategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and
how to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of
two principal components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme leverages a
shallow-layer online probe to obtain a stable prior for the caching error in
real time, enabling the model to autonomously determine caching schedules. (2)
Dynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment combines multi-step caches based on
shallow-layer probe feature trajectory to better approximate the current
feature, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate
DiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved visual
fidelity over state-of-the-art methods on various leading diffusion models
including WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo for video generation, and Flux for image
generation.

Abstract: The image-to-image generation task aims to produce controllable images by
leveraging conditional inputs and prompt instructions. However, existing
methods often train separate control branches for each type of condition,
leading to redundant model structures and inefficient use of computational
resources. To address this, we propose a Unified image-to-image Generation
(UniGen) framework that supports diverse conditional inputs while enhancing
generation efficiency and expressiveness. Specifically, to tackle the widely
existing parameter redundancy and computational inefficiency in controllable
conditional generation architectures, we propose the Condition Modulated Expert
(CoMoE) module. This module aggregates semantically similar patch features and
assigns them to dedicated expert modules for visual representation and
conditional modeling. By enabling independent modeling of foreground features
under different conditions, CoMoE effectively mitigates feature entanglement
and redundant computation in multi-condition scenarios. Furthermore, to bridge
the information gap between the backbone and control branches, we propose
WeaveNet, a dynamic, snake-like connection mechanism that enables effective
interaction between global text-level control from the backbone and
fine-grained control from conditional branches. Extensive experiments on the
Subjects-200K and MultiGen-20M datasets across various conditional image
generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance, validating its advantages in both versatility and
effectiveness. The code has been uploaded to

### [206] [Lightweight Joint Optimization of General-Purpose Vision-Language Models and Retrievers for Medical Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17394)
*Nir Mazor,Tom Hope*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一个联合优化多模态检索器和LVLM的医疗诊断模型，相比标准RAG方法显著提升了困难病例的诊断性能，但在实际应用中仍与理论最优性能存在较大差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策需要解读医学图像进行诊断，从医学文献和医院记录中检索相关视觉信息可以提高诊断准确性。现有标准RAG方法中LVLM的错误信号无法传递到检索器，存在优化不足的问题。

Method: 联合优化多模态检索器和LVLM进行医疗诊断，仅使用通用骨干网络进行轻量级微调。通过对比标准RAG方法，分析不同检索图像对预测结果的影响。

Result: 使用通用骨干网络即可达到与医学预训练模型竞争的结果，在临床多标签分类和视觉问答任务中表现优异。联合检索优化显著改善了标准RAG在困难病例上的性能。

Conclusion: 虽然正确诊断经常可以通过顶级检索图像实现，但实际性能与理论最优存在较大差距，现有重排序方法无法弥合这一差距，为未来方法留下了充分的改进空间。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making often involves interpreting images (e.g., radiology)
for making diagnoses. Retrieving relevant visual information from medical
literature and hospital records could enhance diagnostic accuracy. In this
paper, we develop a model in which a multimodal retriever is jointly optimized
with an LVLM for medical diagnosis, unlike standard RAG where LVLM error signal
is not propagated down to the retriever. We show that using only
general-purpose backbones, with only lightweight fine-tuning, our model is able
to achieve competitive results with medically-pretrained models across clinical
multi-label classification and visual question answering tasks. In a novel
analysis, we additionally find that in many cases different top retrieved
images each lead to different predictions for a given target, and that these
cases are empirically challenging for all models, even for non-retrieval
models. Our joint retrieval optimization significantly improves these
challenging cases over standard RAG. However, oracle analysis reveals that
while the correct diagnosis is frequently achievable using one of the top
retrieved images, in practice there is a large performance gap from the oracle,
and rerankers using frontier LVLMs do not close this gap -- leaving ample room
for improvement by future methods. Code will be made publicly available.

effect, this paper introduces image quality assessment metrics such as PSNR,
UCIQE, and UIQM to quantitatively compare images before and after enhancement
and deeply analyzes the performance of different models in different
scenarios.Furthermore, to improve the practicality and stability of the
underwater visual enhancement system, this paper also provides practical
suggestions from aspects such as model optimization, multi-model fusion, and
hardware selection, aiming to provide strong technical support for visual

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoCo是一个将人体视频生成解耦为结构生成和外观生成的两阶段方法，通过3D结构生成器先产生人体运动序列，再在结构指导下合成外观，解决了现有方法在全身长距离运动生成中的一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型过于关注外观保真度，导致人体运动不真实、物理上不可行且结构一致性差。现有数据集主要关注面部或上半身运动，限制了生成方法的运动范围。

Method: 提出MoCo方法，将人体视频生成解耦为：1）使用高效3D结构生成器从文本提示生成人体运动序列；2）在生成的结构序列指导下合成剩余视频外观。引入Human-Aware Dynamic Control模块和密集跟踪约束来改善稀疏人体结构的细粒度控制。

Result: 大量实验表明，MoCo在生成真实且结构一致的人体视频方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MoCo通过解耦结构和外观生成，结合新构建的大规模全身人体视频数据集，有效解决了复杂多样化人体运动视频生成的挑战。

Abstract: Generating human videos with consistent motion from text prompts remains a
significant challenge, particularly for whole-body or long-range motion.
Existing video generation models prioritize appearance fidelity, resulting in
unrealistic or physically implausible human movements with poor structural
coherence. Additionally, most existing human video datasets primarily focus on
facial or upper-body motions, or consist of vertically oriented dance videos,
limiting the scope of corresponding generation methods to simple movements. To
overcome these challenges, we propose MoCo, which decouples the process of
human video generation into two components: structure generation and appearance
generation. Specifically, our method first employs an efficient 3D structure
generator to produce a human motion sequence from a text prompt. The remaining
video appearance is then synthesized under the guidance of the generated
structural sequence. To improve fine-grained control over sparse human
structures, we introduce Human-Aware Dynamic Control modules and integrate
dense tracking constraints during training. Furthermore, recognizing the
limitations of existing datasets, we construct a large-scale whole-body human
video dataset featuring complex and diverse motions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MoCo outperforms existing approaches in generating realistic
and structurally coherent human videos.

TL;DR: E-BayesSAM是一个高效的贝叶斯SAM框架，通过Token-wise变分贝叶斯推理和无训练不确定性估计，以及自优化KAN网络提高可解释性，在医学图像分割中实现了实时推理、更高精度和更好的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SAM在贝叶斯适应中的三个关键问题：大型预训练模型贝叶斯微调的不稳定性、高计算成本以及黑盒设计缺乏可解释性。

Method: 提出E-BayesSAM框架，结合Token-wise变分贝叶斯推理(T-VBI)进行高效贝叶斯适应，以及自优化Kolmogorov-Arnold网络(SO-KAN)提高可解释性。T-VBI将输出token重新解释为动态概率权重，SO-KAN通过自监督学习改进token预测。

Result: 在五个超声数据集上验证：实现实时推理(0.03秒/图像)、更高的分割精度(剪枝后DSC 89.0% vs 原版88.0% vs MedSAM 88.3%)，并识别出4个关键决策token。

Conclusion: E-BayesSAM统一了效率、可靠性和可解释性，将SAM的多功能性与临床需求相结合，推动了在安全关键医疗应用中的部署。

Abstract: Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has advanced medical image
segmentation, its Bayesian adaptation for uncertainty-aware segmentation
remains hindered by three key issues: (1) instability in Bayesian fine-tuning
of large pre-trained SAMs; (2) high computation cost due to SAM's massive
parameters; (3) SAM's black-box design limits interpretability. To overcome
these, we propose E-BayesSAM, an efficient framework combining Token-wise
Variational Bayesian Inference (T-VBI) for efficienty Bayesian adaptation and
Self-Optimizing Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (SO-KAN) for improving
interpretability. T-VBI innovatively reinterprets SAM's output tokens as
dynamic probabilistic weights and reparameterizes them as latent variables
without auxiliary training, enabling training-free VBI for uncertainty
estimation. SO-KAN improves token prediction with learnable spline activations
via self-supervised learning, providing insight to prune redundant tokens to
boost efficiency and accuracy. Experiments on five ultrasound datasets
demonstrated that E-BayesSAM achieves: (i) real-time inference (0.03s/image),
(ii) superior segmentation accuracy (average DSC: Pruned E-BayesSAM's 89.0\%
vs. E-BayesSAM's 88.0% vs. MedSAM's 88.3%), and (iii) identification of four
critical tokens governing SAM's decisions. By unifying efficiency, reliability,
and interpretability, E-BayesSAM bridges SAM's versatility with clinical needs,
advancing deployment in safety-critical medical applications. The source code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析视觉数据集中的数据泄露现象，即评估基准中的图像在训练过程中已被见过，这会损害模型评估的公平性。由于大规模数据集通常来自互联网，而许多计算机视觉基准是公开可用的，因此需要研究这一问题。

Method: 应用图像检索技术来识别和表征视觉泄露，将其按模态、覆盖范围和程度分为不同类型。

Result: 明确显示所有分析的数据集都存在某种形式的泄露，所有类型的泄露（从严重实例到更微妙的情况）都会损害下游任务中模型评估的可靠性。

Conclusion: 视觉数据集普遍存在数据泄露问题，这对模型评估的公平性和可靠性构成了严重威胁，需要在数据集构建和模型评估中引起重视。

Abstract: We analyze data leakage in visual datasets. Data leakage refers to images in
evaluation benchmarks that have been seen during training, compromising fair
model evaluation. Given that large-scale datasets are often sourced from the
internet, where many computer vision benchmarks are publicly available, our
efforts are focused into identifying and studying this phenomenon. We
characterize visual leakage into different types according to its modality,
coverage, and degree. By applying image retrieval techniques, we unequivocally
show that all the analyzed datasets present some form of leakage, and that all
types of leakage, from severe instances to more subtle cases, compromise the
reliability of model evaluation in downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 提出CPE方法，通过拓扑引导同义语义生成和类别无关判别区域选择，构建全面的文本提示和紧凑的视觉提示，改善视觉语言模型的零样本泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注文本提示和视觉文本适配，但仍面临文本提示不完整和视觉提示噪声的问题，需要从语义角度改善视觉文本对齐

Method: 包含TGSSG（使用大语言模型生成同义语义集，基于语义模糊熵和持续同调分析构建文本提示）和CADRS（使用预训练视觉模型的激活图识别判别区域，过滤噪声区域生成视觉提示），并引入基于TTA和OT的集合匹配策略

Result: 通过构建全面的文本提示和紧凑的视觉提示，实现了更有效的视觉文本对齐

Conclusion: CPE方法通过语义角度的提示增强，显著改善了视觉语言模型的零样本泛化性能

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on web-scale data exhibit promising
zero-shot generalization but often suffer from semantic misalignment due to
domain gaps between pre-training and downstream tasks. Existing approaches
primarily focus on text prompting with class-specific descriptions and
visual-text adaptation via aligning cropped image regions with textual
descriptions. However, they still face the issues of incomplete textual prompts
and noisy visual prompts. In this paper, we propose a novel constrained prompt
enhancement (CPE) method to improve visual-textual alignment by constructing
comprehensive textual prompts and compact visual prompts from the semantic
perspective. Specifically, our approach consists of two key components:
Topology-Guided Synonymous Semantic Generation (TGSSG) and Category-Agnostic
Discriminative Region Selection (CADRS). Textually, to address the issue of
incomplete semantic expression in textual prompts, our TGSSG first generates
synonymous semantic set for each category via large language models, and
constructs comprehensive textual prompts based on semantic ambiguity entropy
and persistent homology analysis. Visually, to mitigate the irrelevant visual
noise introduced by random cropping, our CADRS identifies discriminative
regions with activation maps outputted by a pre-trained vision model,
effectively filtering out noisy regions and generating compact visual prompts.
Given the comprehensive set of textual prompts and compact set of visual
prompts, we introduce two set-to-set matching strategies based on test-time
adaptation (TTA) and optimal transport (OT) to achieve effective visual-textual
alignment, and so improve zero-shot generalization of VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在应对高离群率配准时存在空间复杂度高（图方法）或局部最优问题（多阶段BnB方法），需要一种更高效准确的配准方法

Method: 使用Chasles定理分解刚体变换，通过旋转轴BnB搜索和范围最大查询（RMQ）问题求解，采用立方体映射参数化旋转轴，投影对应关系估计平移，使用扫描线算法和线段树解决2D RMQ

Result: 在3DMatch、3DLoMatch和KITTI数据集上表现出优于当前最优方法的精度和效率，时间复杂度为多项式级，空间复杂度随点数线性增长

Conclusion: 该方法通过几何最大重叠框架和旋转BnB搜索，实现了高效准确的点云配准，即使在最坏情况下也能保持多项式时间复杂度和线性空间复杂度

Abstract: Point cloud registration based on correspondences computes the rigid
transformation that maximizes the number of inliers constrained within the
noise threshold. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employing spatial
compatibility graphs or branch-and-bound (BnB) search mainly focus on
registration under high outlier ratios. However, graph-based methods require at
least quadratic space and time complexity for graph construction, while
multi-stage BnB search methods often suffer from inaccuracy due to local optima
between decomposed stages. This paper proposes a geometric maximum overlapping
registration framework via rotation-only BnB search. The rigid transformation
is decomposed using Chasles' theorem into a translation along rotation axis and
a 2D rigid transformation. The optimal rotation axis and angle are searched via
BnB, with residual parameters formulated as range maximum query (RMQ) problems.
Firstly, the top-k candidate rotation axes are searched within a hemisphere
parameterized by cube mapping, and the translation along each axis is estimated
through interval stabbing of the correspondences projected onto that axis.
Secondly, the 2D registration is relaxed to 1D rotation angle search with 2D
RMQ of geometric overlapping for axis-aligned rectangles, which is solved
deterministically in polynomial time using sweep line algorithm with segment
tree. Experimental results on 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, and KITTI datasets
demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency over SOTA methods, while the time
complexity is polynomial and the space complexity increases linearly with the
number of points, even in the worst case.

Method: 提出FedKLPR框架，包含四个关键组件：KL散度正则化损失约束本地模型、KL散度剪枝加权聚合、稀疏激活跳过机制、跨轮恢复动态剪枝控制。

Result: 在8个基准数据集上，FedKLPR显著减少通信成本（ResNet-50减少33%-38%，ResNet-34减少20%-40%），同时保持模型精度在1%退化范围内。

Conclusion: FedKLPR有效解决了联邦学习中统计异质性和通信开销问题，实现了通信效率与模型精度的良好平衡，为实际部署提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) is a fundamental task in intelligent
surveillance and public safety. Federated learning (FL) offers a
privacy-preserving solution by enabling collaborative model training without
centralized data collection. However, applying FL to real-world re-ID systems
faces two major challenges: statistical heterogeneity across clients due to
non-IID data distributions, and substantial communication overhead caused by
frequent transmission of large-scale models. To address these issues, we
propose FedKLPR, a lightweight and communication-efficient federated learning
framework for person re-identification. FedKLPR introduces four key components.
First, the KL-Divergence Regularization Loss (KLL) constrains local models by
minimizing the divergence from the global feature distribution, effectively
mitigating the effects of statistical heterogeneity and improving convergence
stability under non-IID conditions. Secondly, KL-Divergence-Prune Weighted
Aggregation (KLPWA) integrates pruning ratio and distributional similarity into
the aggregation process, thereby improving the robustness of the global model
while significantly reducing communication overhead. Furthermore, sparse
Activation Skipping (SAS) mitigates the dilution of critical parameters during
the aggregation of pruned client models by excluding zero-valued weights from
the update process. Finally, Cross-Round Recovery (CRR) introduces a dynamic
pruning control mechanism that halts pruning when necessary, enabling deeper
compression while maintaining model accuracy. Experimental results on eight
benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedKLPR achieves significant communication
reduction. Compared with the state-of-the-art, FedKLPR reduces 33\%-38\%
communication cost on ResNet-50 and 20\%-40\% communication cost on ResNet-34,
while maintaining model accuracy within 1\% degradation.

Conclusion: TinySR证明了在保持扩散模型生成能力的同时，通过精心设计的压缩和优化策略可以实现实时性能，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) focuses on recovering
high-quality images from low-resolution inputs that suffer from complex
degradations like noise, blur, and compression. Recently, diffusion models
(DMs) have shown great potential in this area by leveraging strong generative
priors to restore fine details. However, their iterative denoising process
incurs high computational overhead, posing challenges for real-time
applications. Although one-step distillation methods, such as OSEDiff and
TSD-SR, offer faster inference, they remain fundamentally constrained by their
large, over-parameterized model architectures. In this work, we present TinySR,
a compact yet effective diffusion model specifically designed for Real-ISR that
achieves real-time performance while maintaining perceptual quality. We
introduce a Dynamic Inter-block Activation and an Expansion-Corrosion Strategy
to facilitate more effective decision-making in depth pruning. We achieve VAE
compression through channel pruning, attention removal and lightweight SepConv.
We eliminate time- and prompt-related modules and perform pre-caching
techniques to further speed up the model. TinySR significantly reduces
computational cost and model size, achieving up to 5.68x speedup and 83%
parameter reduction compared to its teacher TSD-SR, while still providing high
quality results.

Conclusion: 消融实验、人工评估和分析验证了该代理设计在编辑保真度和上下文保持方面的有效性，为复杂迭代图像编辑提供了强大解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable capabilities of text-to-image (T2I) generation models,
real-world applications often demand fine-grained, iterative image editing that
existing methods struggle to provide. Key challenges include granular
instruction understanding, robust context preservation during modifications,
and the lack of intelligent feedback mechanisms for iterative refinement. This
paper introduces RefineEdit-Agent, a novel, training-free intelligent agent
framework designed to address these limitations by enabling complex, iterative,
and context-aware image editing. RefineEdit-Agent leverages the powerful
planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the advanced visual
understanding and evaluation prowess of Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs)
within a closed-loop system. Our framework comprises an LVLM-driven instruction
parser and scene understanding module, a multi-level LLM-driven editing planner
for goal decomposition, tool selection, and sequence generation, an iterative
image editing module, and a crucial LVLM-driven feedback and evaluation loop.
To rigorously evaluate RefineEdit-Agent, we propose LongBench-T2I-Edit, a new
benchmark featuring 500 initial images with complex, multi-turn editing
instructions across nine visual dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that RefineEdit-Agent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving an average score of 3.67 on LongBench-T2I-Edit, compared to 2.29 for
Direct Re-Prompting, 2.91 for InstructPix2Pix, 3.16 for GLIGEN-based Edit, and
3.39 for ControlNet-XL. Ablation studies, human evaluations, and analyses of
iterative refinement, backbone choices, tool usage, and robustness to
instruction complexity further validate the efficacy of our agentic design in
delivering superior edit fidelity and context preservation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of neural rendering-based multi-view
surface reconstruction methods, which require an additional mesh extraction
step that is inconvenient and would produce poor-quality surfaces with mesh
aliasing, restricting downstream applications. Building on the explicit mesh
representation and differentiable rasterization framework, this work proposes
an efficient solution that preserves the high efficiency of this framework
while significantly improving reconstruction quality and versatility.
Specifically, we introduce a disentangled geometry and appearance model that
does not rely on deep networks, enhancing learning and broadening
applicability. A neural deformation field is constructed to incorporate global
geometric context, enhancing geometry learning, while a novel regularization
constrains geometric features passed to a neural shader to ensure its accuracy
and boost shading. For appearance, a view-invariant diffuse term is separated
and baked into mesh vertices, further improving rendering efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art training (4.84 minutes) and rendering (0.023 seconds) speeds,
with reconstruction quality that is competitive with top-performing methods.
Moreover, the method enables practical applications such as mesh and texture
editing, showcasing its versatility and application potential. This combination
of efficiency, competitive quality, and broad applicability makes our approach
a valuable contribution to multi-view surface reconstruction and rendering.

Abstract: Inferring the physical properties of 3D scenes from visual information is a
critical yet challenging task for creating interactive and realistic virtual
worlds. While humans intuitively grasp material characteristics such as
elasticity or stiffness, existing methods often rely on slow, per-scene
optimization, limiting their generalizability and application. To address this
problem, we introduce PIXIE, a novel method that trains a generalizable neural
network to predict physical properties across multiple scenes from 3D visual
features purely using supervised losses. Once trained, our feed-forward network
can perform fast inference of plausible material fields, which coupled with a
learned static scene representation like Gaussian Splatting enables realistic
physics simulation under external forces. To facilitate this research, we also
collected PIXIEVERSE, one of the largest known datasets of paired 3D assets and
physic material annotations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PIXIE is
about 1.46-4.39x better and orders of magnitude faster than test-time
optimization methods. By leveraging pretrained visual features like CLIP, our
method can also zero-shot generalize to real-world scenes despite only ever

TL;DR: 本文提出了室内3D目标检测的跨数据集适应基准，分析了不同域差距对检测器性能的影响，并提供了改进适应性能的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有室内3D目标检测研究主要在训练和测试集分布相同的有限数据集上进行，缺乏对跨数据集适应能力的考察。不同数据集在点云质量、边界框布局和实例特征等方面存在显著差异，导致检测器容易过拟合到特定数据集的特征。

Method: 构建了包含ScanNet、SUN RGB-D、3D Front以及新提出的ProcTHOR-OD和ProcFront模拟数据集的综合基准。通过实验分析合成到真实、点云质量、布局和实例特征等不同适应场景下的域差距影响，并提出了多种改进适应性能的方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为室内3D目标检测的跨域适应问题提供了系统性的分析框架和基准，有助于推动开发具有更强跨域泛化能力的检测器。

Abstract: As a fundamental task for indoor scene understanding, 3D object detection has
been extensively studied, and the accuracy on indoor point cloud data has been
substantially improved. However, existing researches have been conducted on
limited datasets, where the training and testing sets share the same
distribution. In this paper, we consider the task of adapting indoor 3D object
detectors from one dataset to another, presenting a comprehensive benchmark
with ScanNet, SUN RGB-D and 3D Front datasets, as well as our newly proposed
large-scale datasets ProcTHOR-OD and ProcFront generated by a 3D simulator.
Since indoor point cloud datasets are collected and constructed in different
ways, the object detectors are likely to overfit to specific factors within
each dataset, such as point cloud quality, bounding box layout and instance
features. We conduct experiments across datasets on different adaptation
scenarios including synthetic-to-real adaptation, point cloud quality
adaptation, layout adaptation and instance feature adaptation, analyzing the
impact of different domain gaps on 3D object detectors. We also introduce
several approaches to improve adaptation performances, providing baselines for
domain adaptive indoor 3D object detection, hoping that future works may
propose detectors with stronger generalization ability across domains. Our

*Liyang Peng,Sihan Zhu,Yunjie Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ECVT是一种新颖的双分支视频Transformer架构，利用大型视觉语言模型生成多粒度语义描述，通过跨模态融合机制显著提升视频动作识别和定位性能，在多个基准数据集上达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在复杂未修剪视频中难以捕捉细粒度动作、长期时间依赖和从低级视觉特征提取高级语义信息的局限性。

Method: 采用双分支设计：视频编码分支进行时空特征提取，跨模态引导分支利用LVLM生成全局事件提示和时序子事件提示等多粒度语义描述，通过自适应门控、跨模态注意力和事件图模块进行融合。

Result: 在ActivityNet v1.3上达到40.5%的平均mAP，在THUMOS14上达到67.1%的mAP@0.5，显著超越现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ECVT通过有效整合视觉语言模型的语义理解能力，成功提升了视频时序结构和事件逻辑的理解能力，为复杂视频分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Action recognition and localization in complex, untrimmed videos remain a
formidable challenge in computer vision, largely due to the limitations of
existing methods in capturing fine-grained actions, long-term temporal
dependencies, and high-level semantic information from low-level visual
features. This paper introduces the Event-Contextualized Video Transformer
(ECVT), a novel architecture that leverages the advanced semantic understanding
capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to bridge this gap. ECVT
employs a dual-branch design, comprising a Video Encoding Branch for
spatio-temporal feature extraction and a Cross-Modal Guidance Branch. The
latter utilizes an LVLM to generate multi-granularity semantic descriptions,
including Global Event Prompting for macro-level narrative and Temporal
Sub-event Prompting for fine-grained action details. These multi-level textual
cues are integrated into the video encoder's learning process through
sophisticated mechanisms such as adaptive gating for high-level semantic
fusion, cross-modal attention for fine-grained feature refinement, and an event
graph module for temporal context calibration. Trained end-to-end with a
comprehensive loss function incorporating semantic consistency and temporal
calibration terms, ECVT significantly enhances the model's ability to
understand video temporal structures and event logic. Extensive experiments on
ActivityNet v1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets demonstrate that ECVT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with an average mAP of 40.5% on ActivityNet v1.3
and mAP@0.5 of 67.1% on THUMOS14, outperforming leading baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业环境（如海上石油平台）中收集真实数据面临实践难题和高成本挑战，罚碍了自主检查系统的发展。需要找到一种高效、便宜且安全的方法来解决数据稀缺问题。

Method: 提出混合数据合成流水线：1）使用BlenderProc进行照相实际渲染，产生精确标注和域随机化的图像；2）集成NVIDIA Cosmos-Predict2世界基础模型，生成物理可行的视频序列，捕获稀有视角和不利条件。使用YOLO检测网络训练于真实和合成数据的混合数据集。

Abstract: This work addresses the challenges of data scarcity and high acquisition
costs for training robust object detection models in complex industrial
environments, such as offshore oil platforms. The practical and economic
barriers to collecting real-world data in these hazardous settings often hamper
the development of autonomous inspection systems. To overcome this, in this
work we propose and validate a hybrid data synthesis pipeline that combines
procedural rendering with AI-driven video generation. Our methodology leverages
BlenderProc to create photorealistic images with precise annotations and
controlled domain randomization, and integrates NVIDIA's Cosmos-Predict2
world-foundation model to synthesize physically plausible video sequences with
temporal diversity, capturing rare viewpoints and adverse conditions. We
demonstrate that a YOLO-based detection network trained on a composite dataset,
blending real images with our synthetic data, achieves superior performance
compared to models trained exclusively on real-world data. Notably, a 1:1
mixture of real and synthetic data yielded the highest accuracy, surpassing the
real-only baseline. These findings highlight the viability of a synthetic-first
approach as an efficient, cost-effective, and safe alternative for developing
reliable perception systems in safety-critical and resource-constrained
industrial applications.

Abstract: In the field of multimodal medical data analysis, leveraging diverse types of
data and understanding their hidden relationships continues to be a research
focus. The main challenges lie in effectively modeling the complex interactions
between heterogeneous data modalities with distinct characteristics while
capturing both local and global dependencies across modalities. To address
these challenges, this paper presents a two-stage multimodal prognosis model,
GraphMMP, which is based on graph neural networks. The proposed model
constructs feature graphs using mutual information and features a global fusion
module built on Mamba, which significantly boosts prognosis performance.
Empirical results show that GraphMMP surpasses existing methods on datasets
related to liver prognosis and the METABRIC study, demonstrating its
effectiveness in multimodal medical prognosis tasks.

Conclusion: 所提出的敏感度感知正则化调优框架有效解决了多模态跟踪器优化中的可塑性-稳定性权衡问题，显著提升了跨模态迁移能力。

Abstract: This paper tackles the critical challenge of optimizing multi-modal trackers
by effectively adapting the pre-trained models for RGB data. Existing
fine-tuning paradigms oscillate between excessive freedom and over-restriction,
both leading to a suboptimal plasticity-stability trade-off. To mitigate this
dilemma, we propose a novel sensitivity-aware regularized tuning framework,
which delicately refines the learning process by incorporating intrinsic
parameter sensitivities. Through a comprehensive investigation from pre-trained
to multi-modal contexts, we identify that parameters sensitive to pivotal
foundational patterns and cross-domain shifts are primary drivers of this
issue. Specifically, we first analyze the tangent space of pre-trained weights
to measure and orient prior sensitivities, dedicated to preserving
generalization. Then, we further explore transfer sensitivities during the
tuning phase, emphasizing adaptability and stability. By incorporating these
sensitivities as regularization terms, our method significantly enhances the
transferability across modalities. Extensive experiments showcase the superior
performance of the proposed method, surpassing current state-of-the-art
techniques across various multi-modal tracking. The source code and models will
be publicly available at https://github.com/zhiwen-xdu/SRTrack.

Motivation: 人类社交行为本质上是多模态的，需要强大的视听模型来进行感知。现有模型缺乏针对社交领域数据的专门预训练。

Method: 扩展CAV-MAE模型以接收更多帧输入，在VoxCeleb2人类社交互动数据集上进行自监督预训练，然后在多个社交情感下游任务上进行微调。

Result: 在多模态情感识别和笑声识别任务上达到state-of-the-art水平，在外表个性估计任务上获得有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: 领域内自监督预训练对社交行为感知任务非常有效，Social-MAE展示了在社交多模态理解方面的强大能力。

Abstract: Human social behaviors are inherently multimodal necessitating the
development of powerful audiovisual models for their perception. In this paper,
we present Social-MAE, our pre-trained audiovisual Masked Autoencoder based on
an extended version of Contrastive Audio-Visual Masked Auto-Encoder (CAV-MAE),
which is pre-trained on audiovisual social data. Specifically, we modify
CAV-MAE to receive a larger number of frames as input and pre-train it on a
large dataset of human social interaction (VoxCeleb2) in a self-supervised
manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this model by finetuning and
evaluating the model on different social and affective downstream tasks,
namely, emotion recognition, laughter detection and apparent personality
estimation. The model achieves state-of-the-art results on multimodal emotion
recognition and laughter recognition and competitive results for apparent

TL;DR: 结合DINO和Barlow Twins两种自监督学习方法的优势，提出了一种标签效率更高、计算需求更低的混合模型，在MS COCO数据集上仅使用10%标签数据就达到了与DINO相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无标签图像理解的成本问题，DINO对某些数据增强敏感，Barlow Twins需要大批次训练，难以在消费级硬件上运行。通过结合两种方法的互补优势，实现更高效的训练。

Method: 将Barlow Twins的冗余减少目标与DINO的自蒸馏策略相结合，在MS COCO数据集上使用10%标签数据进行线性探测训练，并与单独的DINO和Barlow Twins实现进行对比评估。

Result: 混合方法在损失和分类准确率方面与DINO相当，同时保持了强大的特征表示能力。注意力可视化显示混合模型具有改进的语义分割能力。

Conclusion: 这种组合方法为在资源受限环境中训练ViT提供了一种可扩展、标签效率高的替代方案。

Abstract: Training AI models to understand images without costly labeled data remains a
challenge. We combine two techniques--DINO (teacher-student learning) and
Barlow Twins (redundancy reduction)--to create a model that learns better with
fewer labels and less compute. While both DINO and Barlow Twins have
independently demonstrated strong performance in self-supervised learning, each
comes with limitations--DINO may be sensitive to certain augmentations, and
Barlow Twins often requires batch sizes too large to fit on consumer hardware.
By combining the redundancy-reduction objective of Barlow Twins with the
self-distillation strategy of DINO, we aim to leverage their complementary
strengths. We train a hybrid model on the MS COCO dataset using only 10\% of
labeled data for linear probing, and evaluate its performance against
standalone DINO and Barlow Twins implementations. Preliminary results show that
the combined approach achieves comparable loss and classification accuracy to
DINO while maintaining strong feature representations. Attention visualizations
further suggest improved semantic segmentation capability in the hybrid model.
This combined method offers a scalable, label-efficient alternative for
training ViTs in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: OmniMRI是一个统一的视觉-语言基础模型，旨在整合MRI工作流程中的多个任务，包括重建、分割、检测、诊断和报告生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MRI工作流程分散且缺乏通用性，现有方法通常是针对特定解剖结构或应用的，缺乏跨临床环境的泛化能力，且很少整合影像数据和语言信息。

Method: 使用大规模异质数据集（60个公共数据集，22万MRI体积，1900万MRI切片）进行多阶段训练：自监督视觉预训练、视觉-语言对齐、多模态预训练和多任务指令微调。

Result: 定性结果表明OmniMRI能够在单一架构中执行多种任务，包括MRI重建、解剖和病理分割、异常检测、诊断建议和放射报告生成。

Conclusion: OmniMRI有潜力将分散的流程整合为可扩展的通用框架，为统一影像和临床语言的端到端MRI解释基础模型铺平道路。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is indispensable in clinical practice but
remains constrained by fragmented, multi-stage workflows encompassing
acquisition, reconstruction, segmentation, detection, diagnosis, and reporting.
While deep learning has achieved progress in individual tasks, existing
approaches are often anatomy- or application-specific and lack generalizability
across diverse clinical settings. Moreover, current pipelines rarely integrate
imaging data with complementary language information that radiologists rely on
in routine practice. Here, we introduce OmniMRI, a unified vision-language
foundation model designed to generalize across the entire MRI workflow. OmniMRI
is trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous corpus curated from 60 public
datasets, over 220,000 MRI volumes and 19 million MRI slices, incorporating
image-only data, paired vision-text data, and instruction-response data. Its
multi-stage training paradigm, comprising self-supervised vision pretraining,
vision-language alignment, multimodal pretraining, and multi-task instruction
tuning, progressively equips the model with transferable visual
representations, cross-modal reasoning, and robust instruction-following
capabilities. Qualitative results demonstrate OmniMRI's ability to perform
diverse tasks within a single architecture, including MRI reconstruction,
anatomical and pathological segmentation, abnormality detection, diagnostic
suggestion, and radiology report generation. These findings highlight OmniMRI's
potential to consolidate fragmented pipelines into a scalable, generalist
framework, paving the way toward foundation models that unify imaging and
clinical language for comprehensive, end-to-end MRI interpretation.

Result: 最佳模型在ACL撕裂检测上达到0.9969 AUC，在乳腺结节恶性检测上达到0.9641 AUC，性能与Mei等人报告的结果相当并超越其他先前工作。未发现RadImageNet预训练在这两个任务上提供优于ImageNet的性能。

Conclusion: 研究确定了医学影像分类任务的最优架构配置，但发现RadImageNet预训练并未在ACL撕裂和乳腺病变分类任务上表现出优于ImageNet的预训练效果。

Abstract: Modern computer vision models have proven to be highly useful for medical
imaging classification and segmentation tasks, but the scarcity of medical
imaging data often limits the efficacy of models trained from scratch. Transfer
learning has emerged as a pivotal solution to this, enabling the fine-tuning of
high-performance models on small data. Mei et al. (2022) found that
pre-training CNNs on a large dataset of radiologist-labeled images
(RadImageNet) enhanced model performance on downstream tasks compared to
ImageNet pretraining. The present work extends Mei et al. (2022) by conducting
a comprehensive investigation to determine optimal CNN architectures for breast
lesion malignancy detection and ACL tear detection, as well as performing
statistical analysis to compare the effect of RadImageNet and ImageNet
pre-training on downstream model performance. Our findings suggest that
1-dimensional convolutional classifiers with skip connections, ResNet50
pre-trained backbones, and partial backbone unfreezing yields optimal
downstream medical classification performance. Our best models achieve AUCs of
0.9969 for ACL tear detection and 0.9641 for breast nodule malignancy
detection, competitive with the results reported by Mei et al. (2022) and
surpassing other previous works. We do not find evidence confirming RadImageNet
pre-training to provide superior downstream performance for ACL tear and breast
lesion classification tasks.

Motivation: 超材料的设计面临几何结构复杂和从架构到性能的非线性映射困难，需要开发新的工具和方法来促进超材料的集成设计和理解。

Method: 开发了MetaDSL领域特定语言来描述超材料设计，构建了包含15万+参数化程序的MetaDB数据库，并创建了MetaBench基准测试套件来评估视觉-语言模型的能力。

Abstract: Metamaterials are micro-architected structures whose geometry imparts highly
tunable-often counter-intuitive-bulk properties. Yet their design is difficult
because of geometric complexity and a non-trivial mapping from architecture to
behaviour. We address these challenges with three complementary contributions.
(i) MetaDSL: a compact, semantically rich domain-specific language that
captures diverse metamaterial designs in a form that is both human-readable and
machine-parsable. (ii) MetaDB: a curated repository of more than 150,000
parameterized MetaDSL programs together with their
derivatives-three-dimensional geometry, multi-view renderings, and simulated
elastic properties. (iii) MetaBench: benchmark suites that test three core
capabilities of vision-language metamaterial assistants-structure
reconstruction, property-driven inverse design, and performance prediction. We
establish baselines by fine-tuning state-of-the-art vision-language models and
deploy an omni-model within an interactive, CAD-like interface. Case studies
show that our framework provides a strong first step toward integrated design
and understanding of structure-representation-property relationships.

Motivation: 军事组织开发高分辨率3D虚拟环境成本高昂，战场环境动态变化需要频繁更新，传统全规模更新方法耗时耗力

Method: 使用相机姿态估计对齐新图像与现有模型，通过变化检测识别场景修改，利用3D生成AI创建新元素的高质量3D资产，并融入人类指导确保准确性

Result: 实验结果表明IDU管道显著减少了更新时间和人工成本

Conclusion: IDU提供了在快速演变的军事场景中维护最新3D模型的成本效益高且针对性的解决方案

Abstract: For simulation and training purposes, military organizations have made
substantial investments in developing high-resolution 3D virtual environments
through extensive imaging and 3D scanning. However, the dynamic nature of
battlefield conditions-where objects may appear or vanish over time-makes
frequent full-scale updates both time-consuming and costly. In response, we
introduce the Incremental Dynamic Update (IDU) pipeline, which efficiently
updates existing 3D reconstructions, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), with
only a small set of newly acquired images. Our approach starts with camera pose
estimation to align new images with the existing 3D model, followed by change
detection to pinpoint modifications in the scene. A 3D generative AI model is
then used to create high-quality 3D assets of the new elements, which are
seamlessly integrated into the existing 3D model. The IDU pipeline incorporates
human guidance to ensure high accuracy in object identification and placement,
with each update focusing on a single new object at a time. Experimental
results confirm that our proposed IDU pipeline significantly reduces update
time and labor, offering a cost-effective and targeted solution for maintaining
up-to-date 3D models in rapidly evolving military scenarios.

Motivation: 生成驱动型世界模型由于扩散模型的迭代性质导致推理速度慢，直接应用现有加速技术会导致质量下降，需要专门针对世界模型多模态特性的加速方案

Method: 分层加速策略：浅层使用补丁刷新机制选择需要重新计算的token；深层使用线性外推方案直接估计中间特征，完全绕过注意力模块和前馈网络的计算

Result: HERO实现了1.73倍的加速效果，质量退化最小，显著优于现有的扩散加速方法

Conclusion: HERO框架通过利用世界模型的特征耦合现象，采用分层加速策略，在保持质量的同时显著提升了推理效率，为世界模型的实时应用提供了可行方案

Abstract: Generation-driven world models create immersive virtual environments but
suffer slow inference due to the iterative nature of diffusion models. While
recent advances have improved diffusion model efficiency, directly applying
these techniques to world models introduces limitations such as quality
degradation. In this paper, we present HERO, a training-free hierarchical
acceleration framework tailored for efficient world models. Owing to the
multi-modal nature of world models, we identify a feature coupling phenomenon,
wherein shallow layers exhibit high temporal variability, while deeper layers
yield more stable feature representations. Motivated by this, HERO adopts
hierarchical strategies to accelerate inference: (i) In shallow layers, a
patch-wise refresh mechanism efficiently selects tokens for recomputation. With
patch-wise sampling and frequency-aware tracking, it avoids extra metric
computation and remain compatible with FlashAttention. (ii) In deeper layers, a
linear extrapolation scheme directly estimates intermediate features. This
completely bypasses the computations in attention modules and feed-forward
networks. Our experiments show that HERO achieves a 1.73$\times$ speedup with
minimal quality degradation, significantly outperforming existing diffusion
acceleration methods.

Abstract: Reasoning about fine-grained spatial relationships in warehouse-scale
environments poses a significant challenge for existing vision-language models
(VLMs), which often struggle to comprehend 3D layouts, object arrangements, and
multimodal cues in real-world industrial settings. In this paper, we present
TinyGiantVLM, a lightweight and modular two-stage framework designed for
physical spatial reasoning, distinguishing itself from traditional geographic
reasoning in complex logistics scenes. Our approach encodes both global and
region-level features from RGB and depth modalities using pretrained visual
backbones. To effectively handle the complexity of high-modality inputs and
diverse question types, we incorporate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) fusion
module, which dynamically combines spatial representations to support
downstream reasoning tasks and improve convergence. Training is conducted in a
two-phase strategy: the first phase focuses on generating free-form answers to
enhance spatial reasoning ability, while the second phase uses normalized
answers for evaluation. Evaluated on Track 3 of the AI City Challenge 2025, our
64M-parameter base model achieved 5th place on the leaderboard with a score of
66.8861, demonstrating strong performance in bridging visual perception and
spatial understanding in industrial environments. We further present an
80M-parameter variant with expanded MoE capacity, which demonstrates improved
performance on spatial reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: HotSpotter是一个快速准确的动物个体识别算法，基于关键点提取和匹配，支持多种物种，在1000+图像数据库中实现秒级匹配且准确率优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要开发一个不依赖物种的快速准确动物个体识别系统，以解决野生动物保护和研究中的个体识别需求

Method: 提出两种基于关键点（热点）提取和匹配的方法：1）顺序查询匹配，为每个数据库图像生成独立分数；2）基于最近邻搜索的快速匹配，采用竞争性评分机制

Result: 在1000+图像的数据库上测试，匹配准确率优于已发表方法，每个查询图像仅需几秒钟即可完成匹配

Conclusion: HotSpotter算法在动物个体识别任务中表现出色，具有快速、准确和跨物种适用的优势

Abstract: We present HotSpotter, a fast, accurate algorithm for identifying individual
animals against a labeled database. It is not species specific and has been
applied to Grevy's and plains zebras, giraffes, leopards, and lionfish. We
describe two approaches, both based on extracting and matching keypoints or
"hotspots". The first tests each new query image sequentially against each
database image, generating a score for each database image in isolation, and
ranking the results. The second, building on recent techniques for instance
recognition, matches the query image against the database using a fast nearest
neighbor search. It uses a competitive scoring mechanism derived from the Local
Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor algorithm recently proposed for category
recognition. We demonstrate results on databases of more than 1000 images,
producing more accurate matches than published methods and matching each query
image in just a few seconds.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于加权Vision Transformer的多任务学习框架，联合预测ADAS-Cog总分及其13个子分数，通过子分数特异性损失权重提升预测准确性和可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注ADAS-Cog总分预测，忽视了13个子分数的预测价值，这些子分数反映不同认知域，某些子分数对总分确定更具影响力

Method: 使用Vision Transformer作为特征提取器，构建多任务学习框架，系统研究子分数特异性损失权重对模型性能的影响

Result: 提出的权重策略具有群体依赖性：强权重对MRI模式更异质的MCI受试者效果更好，中等权重对变异度较低的CN受试者更有效

Conclusion: 均匀权重未充分利用关键子分数且限制泛化能力，该框架为基于MRI的AD预后提供了灵活可解释的端到端学习方法

Abstract: Prognostic modeling is essential for forecasting future clinical scores and
enabling early detection of Alzheimers disease (AD). While most existing
methods focus on predicting the ADAS-Cog global score, they often overlook the
predictive value of its 13 sub-scores, which reflect distinct cognitive
domains. Some sub-scores may exert greater influence on determining global
scores. Assigning higher loss weights to these clinically meaningful sub-scores
can guide the model to focus on more relevant cognitive domains, enhancing both
predictive accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we propose a weighted
Vision Transformer (ViT)-based multi-task learning (MTL) framework to jointly
predict the ADAS-Cog global score using baseline MRI scans and its 13
sub-scores at Month 24. Our framework integrates ViT as a feature extractor and
systematically investigates the impact of sub-score-specific loss weighting on
model performance. Results show that our proposed weighting strategies are
group-dependent: strong weighting improves performance for MCI subjects with
more heterogeneous MRI patterns, while moderate weighting is more effective for
CN subjects with lower variability. Our findings suggest that uniform weighting
underutilizes key sub-scores and limits generalization. The proposed framework
offers a flexible, interpretable approach to AD prognosis using end-to-end
MRI-based learning. (Github repo link will be provided after review)

TL;DR: JCo-MVTON是一个基于多模态扩散变换器的虚拟试穿框架，通过集成扩散生成和多模态条件融合，无需人体掩码即可实现精细控制的虚拟试穿，在公开基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统虚拟试穿系统过度依赖人体掩码，对服装属性的细粒度控制有限，且在真实场景中泛化能力差。需要开发一种无需掩码、能精细控制且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Method: 采用多模态扩散变换器(MM-DiT)主干网络，将参考人物图像和目标服装图像通过专用条件路径直接融入去噪过程。引入双向生成策略构建数据集：一个管道使用基于掩码的模型生成参考图像，另一个对称的"Try-Off"模型以自监督方式恢复相应服装图像。

Result: 在DressCode等公开基准测试中达到最先进性能，在定量指标和人工评估方面显著优于现有方法。在真实世界应用中表现出强大的泛化能力，超越商业系统。

Conclusion: JCo-MVTON通过创新的多模态扩散变换器架构和双向数据集生成策略，成功解决了虚拟试穿领域的核心挑战，为无需掩码的精细控制虚拟试穿提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual try-on systems have long been hindered by heavy reliance on human
body masks, limited fine-grained control over garment attributes, and poor
generalization to real-world, in-the-wild scenarios. In this paper, we propose
JCo-MVTON (Jointly Controllable Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer for Mask-Free
Virtual Try-On), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by
integrating diffusion-based image generation with multi-modal conditional
fusion. Built upon a Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) backbone, our
approach directly incorporates diverse control signals -- such as the reference
person image and the target garment image -- into the denoising process through
dedicated conditional pathways that fuse features within the self-attention
layers. This fusion is further enhanced with refined positional encodings and
attention masks, enabling precise spatial alignment and improved garment-person
integration. To address data scarcity and quality, we introduce a bidirectional
generation strategy for dataset construction: one pipeline uses a mask-based
model to generate realistic reference images, while a symmetric ``Try-Off''
model, trained in a self-supervised manner, recovers the corresponding garment
images. The synthesized dataset undergoes rigorous manual curation, allowing
iterative improvement in visual fidelity and diversity. Experiments demonstrate
that JCo-MVTON achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks
including DressCode, significantly outperforming existing methods in both
quantitative metrics and human evaluations. Moreover, it shows strong
generalization in real-world applications, surpassing commercial systems.

Method: 使用多任务学习框架，结合Vision Transformer和纳式Transformer提取MRI特征，与纵向临床数据融合，联合预测24月全局分数和13个子项目分数

Result: 子分数学习提高了全局分数预测精度。Q1(词语回忆)、Q4(延迟回忆)、Q8(词语识别)等少数子分数在全局预测中占主导地位，但部分关键子分数预测错误较高

Conclusion: 子分数信息化建模具有重要价值，但需要改进多模态融合和适应性损失权重设计，以实现更均衡的学习和更可解释、临床稳健的AD预测框架

Abstract: Accurate prediction of clinical scores is critical for early detection and
prognosis of Alzheimers disease (AD). While existing approaches primarily focus
on forecasting the ADAS-Cog global score, they often overlook the predictive
value of its sub-scores (13 items), which capture domain-specific cognitive
decline. In this study, we propose a multi task learning (MTL) framework that
jointly predicts the global ADAS-Cog score and its sub-scores (13 items) at
Month 24 using baseline MRI and longitudinal clinical scores from baseline and
Month 6. The main goal is to examine how each sub scores particularly those
associated with MRI features contribute to the prediction of the global score,
an aspect largely neglected in prior MTL studies. We employ Vision Transformer
(ViT) and Swin Transformer architectures to extract imaging features, which are
fused with longitudinal clinical inputs to model cognitive progression. Our
results show that incorporating sub-score learning improves global score
prediction. Subscore level analysis reveals that a small subset especially Q1
(Word Recall), Q4 (Delayed Recall), and Q8 (Word Recognition) consistently
dominates the predicted global score. However, some of these influential
sub-scores exhibit high prediction errors, pointing to model instability.
Further analysis suggests that this is caused by clinical feature dominance,
where the model prioritizes easily predictable clinical scores over more
complex MRI derived features. These findings emphasize the need for improved
multimodal fusion and adaptive loss weighting to achieve more balanced
learning. Our study demonstrates the value of sub score informed modeling and
provides insights into building more interpretable and clinically robust AD
prediction frameworks. (Github repo provided)

Conclusion: 基于Mamba架构的重建方法为户外场景开放集分割提供了有效的解决方案，在性能和可扩展性方面都有显著优势

Abstract: LiDAR scanning in outdoor scenes acquires accurate distance measurements over
wide areas, producing large-scale point clouds. Application examples for this
data include robotics, automotive vehicles, and land surveillance. During such
applications, outlier objects from outside the training data will inevitably
appear. Our research contributes a novel approach to open-set segmentation,
leveraging the learnings of object defect-detection research. We also draw on
the Mamba architecture's strong performance in utilising long-range
dependencies and scalability to large data. Combining both, we create a
reconstruction based approach for the task of outdoor scene open-set
segmentation. We show that our approach improves performance not only when
applied to our our own open-set segmentation method, but also when applied to
existing methods. Furthermore we contribute a Mamba based architecture which is
competitive with existing voxel-convolution based methods on challenging,
large-scale pointclouds.

Conclusion: Wound3DAssist框架证明了在真实临床环境中使用的可行性，为慢性伤口管理提供了高效、准确的3D评估解决方案。

Abstract: Managing chronic wounds remains a major healthcare challenge, with clinical
assessment often relying on subjective and time-consuming manual documentation
methods. Although 2D digital videometry frameworks aided the measurement
process, these approaches struggle with perspective distortion, a limited field
of view, and an inability to capture wound depth, especially in anatomically
complex or curved regions. To overcome these limitations, we present
Wound3DAssist, a practical framework for 3D wound assessment using monocular
consumer-grade videos. Our framework generates accurate 3D models from short
handheld smartphone video recordings, enabling non-contact, automatic
measurements that are view-independent and robust to camera motion. We
integrate 3D reconstruction, wound segmentation, tissue classification, and
periwound analysis into a modular workflow. We evaluate Wound3DAssist across
digital models with known geometry, silicone phantoms, and real patients.
Results show that the framework supports high-quality wound bed visualization,
millimeter-level accuracy, and reliable tissue composition analysis. Full
assessments are completed in under 20 minutes, demonstrating feasibility for
real-world clinical use.

Method: 基于模板匹配和回归的检测器，通过少量可学习的卷积或投影层在冻结骨干网络上保留和利用样本的空间布局信息。

Result: 在RPINE、FSCD-147和FSCD-LVIS三个基准测试中优于最先进方法，并在跨数据集评估中表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: TMR方法简单有效，能够处理更广泛的模式类型，为少样本模式检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We address the problem of few-shot pattern detection, which aims to detect
all instances of a given pattern, typically represented by a few exemplars,
from an input image. Although similar problems have been studied in few-shot
object counting and detection (FSCD), previous methods and their benchmarks
have narrowed patterns of interest to object categories and often fail to
localize non-object patterns. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
detector based on template matching and regression, dubbed TMR. While previous
FSCD methods typically represent target exemplars as spatially collapsed
prototypes and lose structural information, we revisit classic template
matching and regression. It effectively preserves and leverages the spatial
layout of exemplars through a minimalistic structure with a small number of
learnable convolutional or projection layers on top of a frozen backbone We
also introduce a new dataset, dubbed RPINE, which covers a wider range of
patterns than existing object-centric datasets. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on the three benchmarks, RPINE, FSCD-147, and
FSCD-LVIS, and demonstrates strong generalization in cross-dataset evaluation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEHVF是一种高效的视觉-语言微调方法，通过动态嵌入和分层视觉特征融合来解决传统LVLM输入序列过长的问题，在保持高效训练和推理的同时获得更高准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉-语言模型将视觉特征投影后与文本标记拼接，导致输入序列长度显著增加，计算开销大。现有方法虽然缓解了序列长度问题，但忽略了模型内部的分层语义表示和浅层视觉编码层中的细粒度视觉信息

Method: 提出DEHVF方法，利用视觉编码器和语言模型固有的分层表示特性，通过轻量级分层视觉融合器动态选择和融合与语义粒度对应的分层特征，将融合后的层相关视觉特征投影对齐后直接嵌入到LLM相应层的FFN中

Result: 在ScienceQA视觉问答和COCO Captions图像描述等多个VL基准测试中，DEHVF比现有的参数高效微调基线实现了更高的准确率，同时保持高效的训练和推理

Conclusion: DEHVF方法不仅避免了序列扩展，还动态融合了多层视觉信息，通过仅微调少量参数，实现了相同语义粒度下跨模态信息的精确对齐和互补

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) commonly follow a paradigm that projects
visual features and then concatenates them with text tokens to form a unified
sequence input for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, this paradigm leads
to a significant increase in the length of the input sequence, resulting in
substantial computational overhead. Existing methods attempt to fuse visual
information into the intermediate layers of LLMs, which alleviate the sequence
length issue but often neglect the hierarchical semantic representations within
the model and the fine-grained visual information available in the shallower
visual encoding layers. To address this limitation, we propose DEHVF, an
efficient vision-language fine-tuning method based on dynamic embedding and
fusion of hierarchical visual features. Its core lies in leveraging the
inherent hierarchical representation characteristics of visual encoders and
language models. Through a lightweight hierarchical visual fuser, it
dynamically selects and fuses hierarchical features corresponding to semantic
granularity based on the internal representations of each layer in LLMs. The
fused layer-related visual features are then projected and aligned before being
directly embedded into the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of the corresponding
layer in LLMs. This approach not only avoids sequence expansion but also
dynamically fuses multi-layer visual information. By fine-tuning only a small
number of parameters, DEHVF achieves precise alignment and complementarity of
cross-modal information at the same semantic granularity. We conducted
experiments across various VL benchmarks, including visual question answering
on ScienceQA and image captioning on COCO Captions. The results demonstrate
that DEHVF achieves higher accuracy than existing parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) baselines while maintaining efficient training and
inference.

Conclusion: HyTver损失函数能够有效解决多硬化症疱块分割中的数据不平衡问题，在保持全面指标性能的同时提高分割精度，为该领域提供了一种更加实用的损失函数选择。

Abstract: Longitudinal Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation is a particularly
challenging problem that involves both input and output imbalance in the data
and segmentation. Therefore in order to develop models that are practical, one
of the solutions is to develop better loss functions. Most models naively use
either Dice loss or Cross-Entropy loss or their combination without too much
consideration. However, one must select an appropriate loss function as the
imbalance can be mitigated by selecting a proper loss function. In order to
solve the imbalance problem, multiple loss functions were proposed that claimed
to solve it. They come with problems of their own which include being too
computationally complex due to hyperparameters as exponents or having
detrimental performance in metrics other than region-based ones. We propose a
novel hybrid loss called HyTver that achieves good segmentation performance
while maintaining performance in other metrics. We achieve a Dice score of
0.659 while also ensuring that the distance-based metrics are comparable to
other popular functions. In addition, we also evaluate the stability of the
loss functions when used on a pre- trained model and perform extensive
comparisons with other popular loss functions

Abstract: Early diagnosis of plant diseases is critical for global food safety, yet
most AI solutions lack the generalization required for real-world agricultural
diversity. These models are typically constrained to specific species, failing

address this gap, we first introduce the FloraSyntropy Archive, a large-scale
dataset of 178,922 images across 35 plant species, annotated with 97 distinct
disease classes. We establish a benchmark by evaluating numerous existing
models on this archive, revealing a significant performance gap. We then
propose FloraSyntropy-Net, a novel federated learning framework (FL) that
integrates a Memetic Algorithm (MAO) for optimal base model selection
(DenseNet201), a novel Deep Block for enhanced feature representation, and a
client-cloning strategy for scalable, privacy-preserving training.
FloraSyntropy-Net achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 96.38% on the
FloraSyntropy benchmark. Crucially, to validate its generalization capability,
we test the model on the unrelated multiclass Pest dataset, where it
demonstrates exceptional adaptability, achieving 99.84% accuracy. This work
provides not only a valuable new resource but also a robust and highly

Abstract: Complex tubular structures are essential in medical imaging and
computer-assisted diagnosis, where their integrity enhances anatomical
visualization and lesion detection. However, existing segmentation algorithms
struggle with structural discontinuities, particularly in severe clinical cases
such as coronary artery stenosis and vessel occlusions, which leads to
undesired discontinuity and compromising downstream diagnostic accuracy.
Therefore, it is imperative to reconnect discontinuous structures to ensure
their completeness. In this study, we explore the tubular structure completion
based on point cloud for the first time and establish a Point Cloud-based
Coronary Artery Completion (PC-CAC) dataset, which is derived from real
clinical data. This dataset provides a novel benchmark for tubular structure
completion. Additionally, we propose TSRNet, a Tubular Structure Reconnection
Network that integrates a detail-preservated feature extractor, a multiple
dense refinement strategy, and a global-to-local loss function to ensure
accurate reconnection while maintaining structural integrity. Comprehensive
experiments on our PC-CAC and two additional public datasets (PC-ImageCAS and
PC-PTR) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics, setting a new benchmark for
point cloud-based tubular structure reconstruction. Our benchmark is available

Abstract: Accurate detection of diseased glomeruli is fundamental to progress in renal
pathology and underpins the delivery of reliable clinical diagnoses. Although
recent advances in computer vision have produced increasingly sophisticated
detection algorithms, the majority of research efforts have focused on normal
glomeruli or instances of global sclerosis, leaving the wider spectrum of
diseased glomerular subtypes comparatively understudied. This disparity is not
without consequence; the nuanced and highly variable morphological
characteristics that define these disease variants frequently elude even the
most advanced computational models. Moreover, ongoing debate surrounds the
choice of optimal imaging magnifications and region-of-view dimensions for
fine-grained glomerular analysis, adding further complexity to the pursuit of
accurate classification and robust segmentation.
  To bridge these gaps, we present M^3-GloDet, a systematic framework designed
to enable thorough evaluation of detection models across a broad continuum of
regions, scales, and classes. Within this framework, we evaluate both
long-standing benchmark architectures and recently introduced state-of-the-art
models that have achieved notable performance, using an experimental design
that reflects the diversity of region-of-interest sizes and imaging resolutions
encountered in routine digital renal pathology. As the results, we found that
intermediate patch sizes offered the best balance between context and
efficiency. Additionally, moderate magnifications enhanced generalization by
reducing overfitting. Through systematic comparison of these approaches on a
multi-class diseased glomerular dataset, our aim is to advance the
understanding of model strengths and limitations, and to offer actionable
insights for the refinement of automated detection strategies and clinical
workflows in the digital pathology domain.

TL;DR: 提出基于视觉语言模型的OOD检测框架，通过跨尺度视觉融合和硬伪OOD样本生成策略，在医学图像中有效识别未知疾病


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在可信医疗诊断系统中，需要检测分布外(OOD)样本以识别未知疾病，避免误诊风险。现有方法在处理与已知疾病相似的未知疾病时存在挑战

Method: 1. 跨尺度视觉融合策略：耦合多尺度视觉嵌入，丰富医学图像细节表示 2. 跨尺度硬伪OOD样本生成策略：最大化提升OOD检测效果

Result: 在三个公共医学数据集上的实验表明，该框架相比现有方法取得了更优越的OOD检测性能

Conclusion: 提出的基于VLM的框架通过层次化视觉信息整合，能够有效应对具有挑战性的未知疾病检测问题

Abstract: In trustworthy medical diagnosis systems, integrating out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection aims to identify unknown diseases in samples, thereby
mitigating the risk of misdiagnosis. In this study, we propose a novel OOD
detection framework based on vision-language models (VLMs), which integrates
hierarchical visual information to cope with challenging unknown diseases that
resemble known diseases. Specifically, a cross-scale visual fusion strategy is
proposed to couple visual embeddings from multiple scales. This enriches the
detailed representation of medical images and thus improves the discrimination
of unknown diseases. Moreover, a cross-scale hard pseudo-OOD sample generation
strategy is proposed to benefit OOD detection maximally. Experimental
evaluations on three public medical datasets support that the proposed
framework achieves superior OOD detection performance compared to existing
methods. The source code is available at https://openi.pcl.ac.cn/OpenMedIA/HVL.

TL;DR: LGTTP是一种语言引导的时间令牌剪枝方法，通过查询中的时间线索自适应剪枝视频令牌，在减少65%计算量的同时保持97-99%的原始性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在处理长视频时面临注意力机制二次复杂度的挑战，需要更高效的视频令牌处理方法。

Method: 提出语言引导时间令牌剪枝(LGTTP)框架，利用查询中的时间线索自适应剪枝视频令牌，在时间相关片段保留更高令牌密度，保持上下文连续性。

Result: 在TimeChat和LLaVA-Video上实现65%计算量减少，保持97-99%性能。QVHighlights上HIT@1提升9.5%，Charades-STA上R@1保持99.6%。

Conclusion: LGTTP在显式时间标记查询上表现优异，适用于通用视频理解任务，是模型无关的高效视频处理解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) struggle with long-form videos due to the
quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms. We propose Language-Guided
Temporal Token Pruning (LGTTP), which leverages temporal cues from queries to
adaptively prune video tokens, preserving contextual continuity while reducing
computational overhead. Unlike uniform pruning or keyframe selection, LGTTP
retains higher token density in temporally relevant segments. Our
model-agnostic framework integrates with TimeChat and LLaVA-Video, achieving a
65% reduction in computation while preserving 97-99% of the original
performance. On QVHighlights, LGTTP improves HIT@1 by +9.5%, and on
Charades-STA, it retains 99.6% of R@1. It excels on queries with explicit
temporal markers and remains effective across general video understanding
tasks.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become an essential component
of medical imaging research, aiming to increase transparency and clinical trust
in deep learning models. This study investigates brain hemorrhage diagnosis
with a focus on explainability through Class Activation Mapping (CAM)
techniques. A pipeline was developed to extract pixellevel segmentation and
detection annotations from classification models using nine state-of-the-art
CAM algorithms, applied across multiple network stages, and quantitatively
evaluated on the Hemorica dataset, which uniquely provides both slice-level
labels and high-quality segmentation masks. Metrics including Dice, IoU, and
pixel-wise overlap were employed to benchmark CAM variants. Results show that
the strongest localization performance occurred at stage 5 of EfficientNetV2S,
with HiResCAM yielding the highest bounding-box alignment and AblationCAM
achieving the best pixel-level Dice (0.57) and IoU (0.40), representing strong
accuracy given that models were trained solely for classification without
segmentation supervision. To the best of current knowledge, this is among the f
irst works to quantitatively compare CAM methods for brain hemorrhage
detection, establishing a reproducible benchmark and underscoring the potential
of XAI-driven pipelines for clinically meaningful AI-assisted diagnosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的超分辨率方法在transformer、扩散模型和GAN之间存在性能差距，需要一种能够整合这些方法优势的新架构

Method: 采用双分支架构：主分支使用扩散启发的transformer逐步细化潜在表示，辅助分支通过学习的潜在对比增强噪声鲁棒性，最后使用残差密集块进行重建

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，CATformer在效率和视觉图像质量方面都优于最近的transformer和扩散方法

Conclusion: 这项工作弥合了transformer、扩散和GAN方法之间的性能差距，为扩散启发的transformer在超分辨率中的实际应用奠定了基础

Abstract: Super-resolution remains a promising technique to enhance the quality of
low-resolution images. This study introduces CATformer (Contrastive Adversarial
Transformer), a novel neural network integrating diffusion-inspired feature
refinement with adversarial and contrastive learning. CATformer employs a
dual-branch architecture combining a primary diffusion-inspired transformer,
which progressively refines latent representations, with an auxiliary
transformer branch designed to enhance robustness to noise through learned
latent contrasts. These complementary representations are fused and decoded
using deep Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks for enhanced reconstruction
quality. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CATformer
outperforms recent transformer-based and diffusion-inspired methods both in
efficiency and visual image quality. This work bridges the performance gap
among transformer-, diffusion-, and GAN-based methods, laying a foundation for
practical applications of diffusion-inspired transformers in super-resolution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NGD方法通过神经梯度变形和自适应网格重划分技术，从单目视频重建动态服装，解决了现有方法在细节建模和变形处理上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染方法在服装动态重建中存在两个主要问题：隐式表示方法生成平滑几何而缺乏高频细节，模板重建方法使用顶点位移导致伪影。需要一种能够同时处理复杂动态和高质量细节重建的方法。

Method: 提出NGD（神经梯度变形）方法，结合神经梯度变形技术、自适应网格重划分策略来建模动态演化的表面细节（如褶皱），并学习动态纹理映射来捕捉每帧的光照和阴影效果。

Result: 通过广泛的定性和定量评估，证明该方法相比现有SOTA方法有显著改进，能够生成高质量的服装重建结果。

Conclusion: NGD方法成功解决了动态服装重建中的关键挑战，在保持几何细节的同时避免了变形伪影，为单目视频中的动态服装重建提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic garment reconstruction from monocular video is an important yet
challenging task due to the complex dynamics and unconstrained nature of the
garments. Recent advancements in neural rendering have enabled high-quality
geometric reconstruction with image/video supervision. However, implicit
representation methods that use volume rendering often provide smooth geometry
and fail to model high-frequency details. While template reconstruction methods
model explicit geometry, they use vertex displacement for deformation, which
results in artifacts. Addressing these limitations, we propose NGD, a Neural
Gradient-based Deformation method to reconstruct dynamically evolving textured
garments from monocular videos. Additionally, we propose a novel adaptive
remeshing strategy for modelling dynamically evolving surfaces like wrinkles
and pleats of the skirt, leading to high-quality reconstruction. Finally, we
learn dynamic texture maps to capture per-frame lighting and shadow effects. We
provide extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations to demonstrate
significant improvements over existing SOTA methods and provide high-quality
garment reconstructions.

Result: F2RVLM在领域内和实际场景下都超过了现有VLM模型，显示出更优秀的检索性能。

Conclusion: 细粒度片段检索是长对话中的重要需求，F2RVLM通过结构化训练和难度适配策略，有效提升了多模态片段检索的准确性和语义连贯性。

Abstract: Traditional dialogue retrieval aims to select the most appropriate utterance
or image from recent dialogue history. However, they often fail to meet users'
actual needs for revisiting semantically coherent content scattered across
long-form conversations. To fill this gap, we define the Fine-grained Fragment
Retrieval (FFR) task, requiring models to locate query-relevant fragments,
comprising both utterances and images, from multimodal long-form dialogues. As
a foundation for FFR, we construct MLDR, the longest-turn multimodal dialogue
retrieval dataset to date, averaging 25.45 turns per dialogue, with each
naturally spanning three distinct topics. To evaluate generalization in
real-world scenarios, we curate and annotate a WeChat-based test set comprising
real-world multimodal dialogues with an average of 75.38 turns. Building on
these resources, we explore existing generation-based Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) on FFR and observe that they often retrieve incoherent utterance-image
fragments. While optimized for generating responses from visual-textual inputs,
these models lack explicit supervision to ensure semantic coherence within
retrieved fragments. To this end, we propose F2RVLM, a generative retrieval
model trained in a two-stage paradigm: (1) supervised fine-tuning to inject
fragment-level retrieval knowledge, and (2) GRPO-based reinforcement learning
with multi-objective rewards promoting semantic precision, relevance, and
contextual coherence. To handle varying intra-fragment complexity, from locally
dense to sparsely distributed, we introduce difficulty-aware curriculum
sampling that ranks training instances by model-predicted difficulty and
gradually exposes the model to harder samples. This boosts reasoning ability in
long, multi-turn contexts. F2RVLM outperforms popular VLMs in both in-domain
and real-domain settings, demonstrating superior retrieval performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖静态预收集偏好或微调，难以适应动态变化的用户意图，需要实现实时、无训练且能处理细粒度偏好的文本到图像生成

Result: 在Viper数据集和自建基准测试中，该方法在定量指标和人工评估方面均优于现有方法，支持多轮交互式优化

Conclusion: 该方法为基于对话的生成和MLLM-扩散模型集成开辟了新可能性，实现了实时、上下文感知的图像生成

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has greatly enhanced creative expression, yet
achieving preference-aligned generation in a real-time and training-free manner
remains challenging. Previous methods often rely on static, pre-collected
preferences or fine-tuning, limiting adaptability to evolving and nuanced user
intents. In this paper, we highlight the need for instant preference-aligned
T2I generation and propose a training-free framework grounded in multimodal
large language model (MLLM) priors. Our framework decouples the task into two
components: preference understanding and preference-guided generation. For
preference understanding, we leverage MLLMs to automatically extract global
preference signals from a reference image and enrich a given prompt using
structured instruction design. Our approach supports broader and more
fine-grained coverage of user preferences than existing methods. For
preference-guided generation, we integrate global keyword-based control and
local region-aware cross-attention modulation to steer the diffusion model
without additional training, enabling precise alignment across both global
attributes and local elements. The entire framework supports multi-round
interactive refinement, facilitating real-time and context-aware image
generation. Extensive experiments on the Viper dataset and our collected
benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms prior approaches in both
quantitative metrics and human evaluations, and opens up new possibilities for
dialog-based generation and MLLM-diffusion integration.

Conclusion: 该框架首次将扩散模型增强策略专门用于增强动作异常检测的对比学习，有效解决了少样本人类动作异常检测的挑战

Abstract: Human Action Anomaly Detection (HAAD) aims to identify anomalous actions
given only normal action data during training. Existing methods typically
follow a one-model-per-category paradigm, requiring separate training for each
action category and a large number of normal samples. These constraints hinder
scalability and limit applicability in real-world scenarios, where data is
often scarce or novel categories frequently appear. To address these
limitations, we propose a unified framework for HAAD that is compatible with
few-shot scenarios. Our method constructs a category-agnostic representation
space via contrastive learning, enabling AD by comparing test samples with a
given small set of normal examples (referred to as the support set). To improve
inter-category generalization and intra-category robustness, we introduce a
generative motion augmentation strategy harnessing a diffusion-based foundation
model for creating diverse and realistic training samples. Notably, to the best
of our knowledge, our work is the first to introduce such a strategy
specifically tailored to enhance contrastive learning for action AD. Extensive
experiments on the HumanAct12 dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art
effectiveness of our approach under both seen and unseen category settings,
regarding training efficiency and model scalability for few-shot HAAD.

Abstract: In Text-to-Image (T2I) generation, the complexity of entities and their
intricate interactions pose a significant challenge for T2I method based on
diffusion model: how to effectively control entity and their interactions to
produce high-quality images. To address this, we propose CEIDM, a image
generation method based on diffusion model with dual controls for entity and
interaction. First, we propose an entity interactive relationships mining
approach based on Large Language Models (LLMs), extracting reasonable and rich
implicit interactive relationships through chain of thought to guide diffusion
models to generate high-quality images that are closer to realistic logic and
have more reasonable interactive relationships. Furthermore, We propose an
interactive action clustering and offset method to cluster and offset the
interactive action features contained in each text prompts. By constructing
global and local bidirectional offsets, we enhance semantic understanding and
detail supplementation of original actions, making the model's understanding of
the concept of interactive "actions" more accurate and generating images with
more accurate interactive actions. Finally, we design an entity control network
which generates masks with entity semantic guidance, then leveraging
multi-scale convolutional network to enhance entity feature and dynamic network
to fuse feature. It effectively controls entities and significantly improves
image quality. Experiments show that the proposed CEIDM method is better than
the most representative existing methods in both entity control and their
interaction control.

Result: 分割图像使精确度提高约0.41%，F1分数提高约1.30%，但整体提升有限

Conclusion: 分割有助于特征提取但对分类性能影响有限，该框架可作为临床辅助工具帮助病理学家早期诊断

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a significant global health concern and a leading
cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Early detection through Pap smear
tests is essential to reduce mortality rates; however, the manual examination
is time consuming and prone to human error. This study proposes a deep learning
framework that integrates U-Net for segmentation and a classification model to
enhance diagnostic performance. The Herlev Pap Smear Dataset, a publicly
available cervical cell dataset, was utilized for training and evaluation. The
impact of segmentation on classification performance was evaluated by comparing
the model trained on segmented images and another trained on non-segmented
images. Experimental results showed that the use of segmented images marginally
improved the model performance on precision (about 0.41 percent higher) and
F1-score (about 1.30 percent higher), which suggests a slightly more balanced
classification performance. While segmentation helps in feature extraction, the
results showed that its impact on classification performance appears to be
limited. The proposed framework offers a supplemental tool for clinical
applications, which may aid pathologists in early diagnosis.

Conclusion: CMFDNet通过创新的模块设计有效解决了息肉分割中的三个关键挑战，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能表现。

Abstract: Automated colonic polyp segmentation is crucial for assisting doctors in
screening of precancerous polyps and diagnosis of colorectal neoplasms.
Although existing methods have achieved promising results, polyp segmentation
remains hindered by the following limitations,including: (1) significant
variation in polyp shapes and sizes, (2) indistinct boundaries between polyps
and adjacent tissues, and (3) small-sized polyps are easily overlooked during
the segmentation process. Driven by these practical difficulties, an innovative
architecture, CMFDNet, is proposed with the CMD module, MSA module, and FD
module. The CMD module, serving as an innovative decoder, introduces a
cross-scanning method to reduce blurry boundaries. The MSA module adopts a
multi-branch parallel structure to enhance the recognition ability for polyps
with diverse geometries and scale distributions. The FD module establishes
dependencies among all decoder features to alleviate the under-detection of
polyps with small-scale features. Experimental results show that CMFDNet
outperforms six SOTA methods used for comparison, especially on ETIS and
ColonDB datasets, where mDice scores exceed the best SOTA method by 1.83% and
1.55%, respectively.

Abstract: Visual speech recognition (VSR) systems decode spoken words from an input
sequence using only the video data. Practical applications of such systems
include medical assistance as well as human-machine interactions. A VSR system
is typically employed in a complementary role in cases where the audio is
corrupt or not available. In order to accurately predict the spoken words,
these architectures often rely on deep neural networks in order to extract
meaningful representations from the input sequence. While deep architectures
achieve impressive recognition performance, relying on such models incurs
significant computation costs which translates into increased resource demands
in terms of hardware requirements and results in limited applicability in
real-world scenarios where resources might be constrained. This factor prevents
wider adoption and deployment of speech recognition systems in more practical
applications. In this work, we aim to alleviate this issue by developing
architectures for VSR that have low hardware costs. Following the standard
two-network design paradigm, where one network handles visual feature
extraction and another one utilizes the extracted features to classify the
entire sequence, we develop lightweight end-to-end architectures by first
benchmarking efficient models from the image classification literature, and
then adopting lightweight block designs in a temporal convolution network
backbone. We create several unified models with low resource requirements but
strong recognition performance. Experiments on the largest public database for
English words demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our developed
models. Code and trained models will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Estimating the 3D pose of a drone is important for anti-drone systems, but
existing methods struggle with the unique challenges of drone keypoint
detection. Drone propellers serve as keypoints but are difficult to detect due
to their high visual similarity and diversity of poses. To address these
challenges, we propose DroneKey, a framework that combines a 2D keypoint
detector and a 3D pose estimator specifically designed for drones. In the
keypoint detection stage, we extract two key-representations (intermediate and
compact) from each transformer encoder layer and optimally combine them using a
gated sum. We also introduce a pose-adaptive Mahalanobis distance in the loss
function to ensure stable keypoint predictions across extreme poses. We built
new datasets of drone 2D keypoints and 3D pose to train and evaluate our
method, which have been publicly released. Experiments show that our method
achieves an AP of 99.68% (OKS) in keypoint detection, outperforming existing
methods. Ablation studies confirm that the pose-adaptive Mahalanobis loss
function improves keypoint prediction stability and accuracy. Additionally,
improvements in the encoder design enable real-time processing at 44 FPS. For
3D pose estimation, our method achieved an MAE-angle of 10.62{\deg}, an RMSE of
0.221m, and an MAE-absolute of 0.076m, demonstrating high accuracy and
reliability. The code and dataset are available at

Abstract: The recycling of contrastive language-image pre-trained (CLIP) models as
backbones for a large number of downstream tasks calls for a thorough analysis
of their transferability implications, especially their well-documented
reproduction of social biases and human stereotypes. How do such biases,
learned during pre-training, propagate to downstream applications like visual
question answering or image captioning? Do they transfer at all?
  We investigate this phenomenon, referred to as bias transfer in prior
literature, through a comprehensive empirical analysis. Firstly, we examine how
pre-training bias varies between global and local views of data, finding that
bias measurement is highly dependent on the subset of data on which it is
computed. Secondly, we analyze correlations between biases in the pre-trained
models and the downstream tasks across varying levels of pre-training bias,
finding difficulty in discovering consistent trends in bias transfer. Finally,
we explore why this inconsistency occurs, showing that under the current
paradigm, representation spaces of different pre-trained CLIPs tend to converge
when adapted for downstream tasks. We hope this work offers valuable insights
into bias behavior and informs future research to promote better bias
mitigation practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业异常检测中训练数据常包含错误标签样本，传统方法对此敏感，需要开发能够抵抗标签噪声的鲁棒检测框架。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和KSDD2数据集上，干净条件下分别达到95.4%和94.6%的I-AUROC分数，即使在50%训练样本被错误标注时仍能保持86.8%和92.1%的检测性能。

Conclusion: RAD框架对噪声训练条件具有卓越的鲁棒性，能够检测各种工业场景中的细微异常，是实际应用中数据标注不完美时的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is fundamental for ensuring quality control and operational
efficiency in industrial environments, yet conventional approaches face
significant challenges when training data contains mislabeled samples-a common
occurrence in real-world scenarios. This paper presents RAD, a robust anomaly
detection framework that integrates Normalizing Flows with Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning to address the critical challenge of label noise in industrial
settings. Our approach employs a bi-level optimization strategy where
meta-learning enables rapid adaptation to varying noise conditions, while
uncertainty quantification guides adaptive L2 regularization to maintain model
stability. The framework incorporates multiscale feature processing through
pretrained feature extractors and leverages the precise likelihood estimation
capabilities of Normalizing Flows for robust anomaly scoring. Comprehensive
evaluation on MVTec-AD and KSDD2 datasets demonstrates superior performance,
achieving I-AUROC scores of 95.4% and 94.6% respectively under clean
conditions, while maintaining robust detection capabilities above 86.8% and
92.1% even when 50% of training samples are mislabeled. The results highlight
RAD's exceptional resilience to noisy training conditions and its ability to
detect subtle anomalies across diverse industrial scenarios, making it a
practical solution for real-world anomaly detection applications where perfect
data curation is challenging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有细胞分割网络（如Cellpose、Stardist、HoverNet等）依赖距离映射预测，虽然精度高但需要完全标注的数据集，这限制了训练集生成和迁移学习

Method: 开发了一种仍基于距离映射但能处理部分标注对象的方法，该方法集成在用户友好的Napari插件中

Result: 在节俭学习、迁移学习和常规数据库学习场景下评估，实验表明该方法能显著节省时间和资源，同时不牺牲分割质量

Conclusion: 该方法解决了完全标注数据集的限制问题，为细胞分割提供了更高效且资源友好的解决方案

Abstract: The most popular networks used for cell segmentation (e.g. Cellpose,
Stardist, HoverNet,...) rely on a prediction of a distance map. It yields
unprecedented accuracy but hinges on fully annotated datasets. This is a
serious limitation to generate training sets and perform transfer learning. In
this paper, we propose a method that still relies on the distance map and
handles partially annotated objects. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed approach in the contexts of frugal learning, transfer learning and
regular learning on regular databases. Our experiments show that it can lead to
substantial savings in time and resources without sacrificing segmentation
quality. The proposed algorithm is embedded in a user-friendly Napari plugin.

Motivation: 视视觉模型中存在近期偏差，导致图像底部刷选不优，需要解决这个问题

Method: 提出位置重新加权机制，根据视觉刷的空间位置调整关注分数

Result: 在多个LVLM上验证了方法的有效性，在计算开销最小的情况下提升了视觉刷选性能

Conclusion: 该方法是一个即插即用的解决方案，可以无缝集成到现有视觉刷选框架中

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically process a significantly larger number
of visual tokens compared to text tokens due to the inherent redundancy in
visual signals. Visual token pruning is a promising direction to reduce the
computational cost of VLMs by eliminating redundant visual tokens. The
text-visual attention score is a widely adopted criterion for visual token
pruning as it reflects the relevance of visual tokens to the text input.
However, many sequence models exhibit a recency bias, where tokens appearing
later in the sequence exert a disproportionately large influence on the model's
output. In VLMs, this bias manifests as inflated attention scores for tokens
corresponding to the lower regions of the image, leading to suboptimal pruning
that disproportionately retains tokens from the image bottom. In this paper, we
present an extremely simple yet effective approach to alleviate the recency
bias in visual token pruning. We propose a straightforward reweighting
mechanism that adjusts the attention scores of visual tokens according to their
spatial positions in the image. Our method, termed Position-reweighted Visual
Token Pruning, is a plug-and-play solution that can be seamlessly incorporated
into existing visual token pruning frameworks without any changes to the model
architecture or extra training. Extensive experiments on LVLMs demonstrate that
our method improves the performance of visual token pruning with minimal
computational overhead.

Method: 提出UniSino基础模型，直接在投影域标准化数据，训练框架结合了投影数据的物理特性，支持多个子任务

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，UniSino在单种和混合欠采样情况下都实现了优越的重建质量，表现出卓越的鲁棒性和泛化能力

Conclusion: UniSino为CT投影数据增强提供了一个有效的通用解决方案，代码已开源

Abstract: During raw-data acquisition in CT imaging, diverse factors can degrade the
collected sinograms, with undersampling and noise leading to severe artifacts
and noise in reconstructed images and compromising diagnostic accuracy.
Conventional correction methods rely on manually designed algorithms or fixed
empirical parameters, but these approaches often lack generalizability across
heterogeneous artifact types. To address these limitations, we propose UniSino,
a foundation model for universal CT sinogram standardization. Unlike existing
foundational models that operate in image domain, UniSino directly standardizes
data in the projection domain, which enables stronger generalization across
diverse undersampling scenarios. Its training framework incorporates the
physical characteristics of sinograms, enhancing generalization and enabling
robust performance across multiple subtasks spanning four benchmark datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate thatUniSino achieves superior reconstruction
quality both single and mixed undersampling case, demonstrating exceptional
robustness and generalization in sinogram enhancement for CT imaging. The code

Conclusion: 该框架通过显式建模时序依赖性和视觉-语义协作，有效解决了视频融合中的时序一致性问题，为视频融合任务提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Existing multi-modal fusion methods typically apply static frame-based image
fusion techniques directly to video fusion tasks, neglecting inherent temporal
dependencies and leading to inconsistent results across frames. To address this
limitation, we propose the first video fusion framework that explicitly
incorporates temporal modeling with visual-semantic collaboration to
simultaneously ensure visual fidelity, semantic accuracy, and temporal
consistency. First, we introduce a visual-semantic interaction module
consisting of a semantic branch and a visual branch, with Dinov2 and VGG19
employed for targeted distillation, allowing simultaneous enhancement of both
the visual and semantic representations. Second, we pioneer integrate the video
degradation enhancement task into the video fusion pipeline by constructing a
temporal cooperative module, which leverages temporal dependencies to
facilitate weak information recovery. Third, to ensure temporal consistency, we
embed a temporal-enhanced mechanism into the network and devise a temporal loss
to guide the optimization process. Finally, we introduce two innovative
evaluation metrics tailored for video fusion, aimed at assessing the temporal
consistency of the generated fused videos. Extensive experimental results on
public video datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code is

Conclusion: 该框架消除了对视觉语言对齐或模型集成的依赖，在资源受限环境中具有快速部署价值，为工业和医疗异常检测提供了有效的零样本解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial and medical anomaly detection faces critical challenges from data
scarcity and prohibitive annotation costs, particularly in evolving
manufacturing and healthcare settings. To address this, we propose CoZAD, a
novel zero-shot anomaly detection framework that integrates soft confident
learning with meta-learning and contrastive feature representation. Unlike
traditional confident learning that discards uncertain samples, our method
assigns confidence-based weights to all training data, preserving boundary
information while emphasizing prototypical normal patterns. The framework
quantifies data uncertainty through IQR-based thresholding and model
uncertainty via covariance based regularization within a Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning. Contrastive learning creates discriminative feature spaces where
normal patterns form compact clusters, enabling rapid domain adaptation.
Comprehensive evaluation across 10 datasets spanning industrial and medical
domains demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing
methods on 6 out of 7 industrial benchmarks with notable improvements on
texture-rich datasets (99.2% I-AUROC on DTD-Synthetic, 97.2% on BTAD) and
pixellevel localization (96.3% P-AUROC on MVTec-AD). The framework eliminates
dependence on vision-language alignments or model ensembles, making it valuable
for resourceconstrained environments requiring rapid deployment.

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了场景生成领域，为需要详细3D环境的应用开辟了新可能性，将发布代码以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene generation is crucial for virtual reality, interior
design, embodied intelligence, and scene understanding. While existing methods
have made progress in coarse-scale furniture arrangement, they struggle to
capture fine-grained object placements, limiting the realism and utility of
generated environments. This gap hinders immersive virtual experiences and
detailed scene comprehension for embodied AI applications. To address these
issues, we propose Hierarchical Layout Generation (HLG), a novel method for
fine-grained 3D scene generation. HLG is the first to adopt a coarse-to-fine
hierarchical approach, refining scene layouts from large-scale furniture
placement to intricate object arrangements. Specifically, our fine-grained
layout alignment module constructs a hierarchical layout through vertical and
horizontal decoupling, effectively decomposing complex 3D indoor scenes into
multiple levels of granularity. Additionally, our trainable layout optimization
network addresses placement issues, such as incorrect positioning, orientation
errors, and object intersections, ensuring structurally coherent and physically
plausible scene generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through extensive experiments, showing superior performance in generating
realistic indoor scenes compared to existing methods. This work advances the
field of scene generation and opens new possibilities for applications
requiring detailed 3D environments. We will release our code upon publication
to encourage future research.

Result: 在新建数据集RefTextCOD上实验表明，该方法超越现有半监督方法，达到state-of-the-art性能

Conclusion: SCOUT方法有效提升了半监督伪装目标检测的性能，通过更好的未标注数据利用和文本信息融合取得了显著改进

Abstract: The difficulty of pixel-level annotation has significantly hindered the
development of the Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) field. To save on
annotation costs, previous works leverage the semi-supervised COD framework
that relies on a small number of labeled data and a large volume of unlabeled
data. We argue that there is still significant room for improvement in the
effective utilization of unlabeled data. To this end, we introduce a
Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection by Utilizing Text and Adaptive
Data Selection (SCOUT). It includes an Adaptive Data Augment and Selection
(ADAS) module and a Text Fusion Module (TFM). The ADSA module selects valuable
data for annotation through an adversarial augment and sampling strategy. The
TFM module further leverages the selected valuable data by combining
camouflage-related knowledge and text-visual interaction. To adapt to this
work, we build a new dataset, namely RefTextCOD. Extensive experiments show
that the proposed method surpasses previous semi-supervised methods in the COD
field and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be released at
https://github.com/Heartfirey/SCOUT.

Conclusion: DiffAug框架通过文本引导的扩散生成和自动验证机制，有效解决了医学图像罕见异常分割的数据稀缺问题，显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation models struggle with rare abnormalities due to
scarce annotated pathological data. We propose DiffAug a novel framework that
combines textguided diffusion-based generation with automatic segmentation
validation to address this challenge. Our proposed approach uses latent
diffusion models conditioned on medical text descriptions and spatial masks to
synthesize abnormalities via inpainting on normal images. Generated samples
undergo dynamic quality validation through a latentspace segmentation network
that ensures accurate localization while enabling single-step inference. The
text prompts, derived from medical literature, guide the generation of diverse
abnormality types without requiring manual annotation. Our validation mechanism
filters synthetic samples based on spatial accuracy, maintaining quality while
operating efficiently through direct latent estimation. Evaluated on three
medical imaging benchmarks (CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, REFUGE2), our framework
achieves state-of-the-art performance with 8-10% Dice improvements over
baselines and reduces false negative rates by up to 28% for challenging cases
like small polyps and flat lesions critical for early detection in screening
applications.

Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型具有出色的零样本泛化能力，但提示调优的泛化能力有限。标签平滑作为有效的正则化技术可以防止模型过拟合，但直接应用会削弱提示调优的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained vision-language models have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities. To further enhance these
models' adaptability to various downstream tasks, prompt tuning has emerged as
a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. However, despite its efficiency, the
generalization ability of prompt remains limited. In contrast, label smoothing
(LS) has been widely recognized as an effective regularization technique that
prevents models from becoming over-confident and improves their generalization.
This inspires us to explore the integration of LS with prompt tuning. However,
we have observed that the vanilla LS even weakens the generalization ability of
prompt tuning. To address this issue, we propose the Alternating Training-based
Label Smoothing (ATLaS) method, which alternately trains with standard one-hot
labels and soft labels generated by LS to supervise the prompt tuning.
Moreover, we introduce two types of efficient offline soft labels, including
Class-wise Soft Labels (CSL) and Instance-wise Soft Labels (ISL), to provide
inter-class or instance-class relationships for prompt tuning. The theoretical
properties of the proposed ATLaS method are analyzed. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed ATLaS method, combined with CSL and ISL,
consistently enhances the generalization performance of prompt tuning.
Moreover, the proposed ATLaS method exhibits high compatibility with prevalent
prompt tuning methods, enabling seamless integration into existing methods.

Abstract: Training deep object detectors demands expensive bounding box annotation.
Active learning (AL) is a promising technique to alleviate the annotation
burden. Performing AL at box-level for object detection, i.e., selecting the
most informative boxes to label and supplementing the sparsely-labelled image
with pseudo labels, has been shown to be more cost-effective than selecting and
labelling the entire image. In box-level AL for object detection, we observe
that models at early stage can only perform well on majority classes, making
the pseudo labels severely class-imbalanced. We propose a class-balanced
sampling strategy to select more objects from minority classes for labelling,
so as to make the final training data, \ie, ground truth labels obtained by AL
and pseudo labels, more class-balanced to train a better model. We also propose
a task-aware soft pseudo labelling strategy to increase the accuracy of pseudo
labels. We evaluate our method on public benchmarking datasets and show that
our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型中视觉token过多导致的推理效率低下问题

Conclusion: VISA方法有效解决了视觉token冗余问题，为多模态大语言模型提供了高效的视觉信息压缩方案

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel method called group-wise \textbf{VI}sual
token \textbf{S}election and \textbf{A}ggregation (VISA) to address the issue
of inefficient inference stemming from excessive visual tokens in multimoal
large language models (MLLMs). Compared with previous token pruning approaches,
our method can preserve more visual information while compressing visual
tokens. We first propose a graph-based visual token aggregation (VTA) module.
VTA treats each visual token as a node, forming a graph based on semantic
similarity among visual tokens. It then aggregates information from removed
tokens into kept tokens based on this graph, producing a more compact visual
token representation. Additionally, we introduce a group-wise token selection
strategy (GTS) to divide visual tokens into kept and removed ones, guided by
text tokens from the final layers of each group. This strategy progressively
aggregates visual information, enhancing the stability of the visual
information extraction process. We conduct comprehensive experiments on
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT, and Video-LLaVA across various benchmarks to validate
the efficacy of VISA. Our method consistently outperforms previous methods,
achieving a superior trade-off between model performance and inference speed.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理多图像VQA中的视觉冗余问题，通过灵活的视觉压缩和协同解码机制，显著提高了多模态大语言模型的表现。

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven
significant progress in Visual Question Answering (VQA), evolving from Single
to Multi Image VQA (MVQA). However, the increased number of images in MVQA
inevitably introduces substantial visual redundancy that is irrelevant to
question answering, negatively impacting both accuracy and efficiency. To
address this issue, existing methods lack flexibility in controlling the number
of compressed visual tokens and tend to produce discrete visual fragments,
which hinder MLLMs' ability to comprehend images holistically. In this paper,
we propose a straightforward yet universal Adaptive Visual Anchoring strategy,
which can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs, offering significant
accuracy improvements through adaptive compression. Meanwhile, to balance the
results derived from both global and compressed visual input, we further
introduce a novel collaborative decoding mechanism, enabling optimal
performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method,
demonstrating consistent performance improvements across various MLLMs. The
code will be publicly available.

Conclusion: GS-SMC框架提供了一种轻量级、无需重新训练的相机位姿优化方案，利用3DGS的广泛适用性和几何约束，显著提升了位姿估计精度

Abstract: Camera pose refinement aims at improving the accuracy of initial pose
estimation for applications in 3D computer vision. Most refinement approaches
rely on 2D-3D correspondences with specific descriptors or dedicated networks,
requiring reconstructing the scene again for a different descriptor or fully
retraining the network for each scene. Some recent methods instead infer pose
from feature similarity, but their lack of geometry constraints results in less
accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel camera pose
refinement framework leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), referred to as
GS-SMC. Given the widespread usage of 3DGS, our method can employ an existing
3DGS model to render novel views, providing a lightweight solution that can be
directly applied to diverse scenes without additional training or fine-tuning.
Specifically, we introduce an iterative optimization approach, which refines
the camera pose using epipolar geometric constraints among the query and
multiple rendered images. Our method allows flexibly choosing feature
extractors and matchers to establish these constraints. Extensive empirical
evaluations on the 7-Scenes and the Cambridge Landmarks datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art camera pose refinement approaches,
achieving 53.3% and 56.9% reductions in median translation and rotation errors

Motivation: 生成模型的快速发展导致AI生成图像日益逼真，给数字取证和内容认证带来挑战。传统检测方法主要依赖提取全局特征的深度学习模型，往往忽略细微结构不一致性且计算资源需求大

Method: 混合检测框架：微调Vision Transformer + 新颖的边缘图像处理模块。边缘模块计算平滑前后边缘差异图的方差，利用AI生成图像通常纹理更平滑、边缘更弱、噪声更少的特点

Conclusion: 该方法为静态图像和视频帧提供了一种轻量级、可解释且有效的解决方案，非常适合自动化内容验证和数字取证的实际应用

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has led to a growing prevalence of
highly realistic AI-generated images, posing significant challenges for digital
forensics and content authentication. Conventional detection methods mainly
rely on deep learning models that extract global features, which often overlook
subtle structural inconsistencies and demand substantial computational
resources. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid detection
framework that combines a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) with a novel
edge-based image processing module. The edge-based module computes variance
from edge-difference maps generated before and after smoothing, exploiting the
observation that AI-generated images typically exhibit smoother textures,
weaker edges, and reduced noise compared to real images. When applied as a
post-processing step on ViT predictions, this module enhances sensitivity to
fine-grained structural cues while maintaining computational efficiency.
Extensive experiments on the CIFAKE, Artistic, and Custom Curated datasets
demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior detection performance
across all benchmarks, attaining 97.75% accuracy and a 97.77% F1-score on
CIFAKE, surpassing widely adopted state-of-the-art models. These results
establish the proposed method as a lightweight, interpretable, and effective
solution for both still images and video frames, making it highly suitable for
real-world applications in automated content verification and digital
forensics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低光照图像增强中现有方法因基准数据集光模式差异导致的过拟合问题，同时更好地整合光照和语义信息来提升图像质量。

Method: 提出HISA-MSA自注意力块，分别处理光照和语义特征并相互丰富；使用基于MoE的FFN增强上下文学习；引入LoRA技术防止过拟合。

Result: 在多个专业数据集上的定性和定量评估表明，ISALux与最先进方法相比具有竞争力，消融研究验证了各组件的重要性。

Conclusion: ISALux成功整合了光照和语义先验，通过新颖的注意力机制和MoE架构，为低光照图像增强提供了有效的解决方案，代码将在发表后开源。

Abstract: We introduce ISALux, a novel transformer-based approach for Low-Light Image
Enhancement (LLIE) that seamlessly integrates illumination and semantic priors.
Our architecture includes an original self-attention block, Hybrid Illumination
and Semantics-Aware Multi-Headed Self- Attention (HISA-MSA), which integrates
illumination and semantic segmentation maps for en- hanced feature extraction.
ISALux employs two self-attention modules to independently process illumination
and semantic features, selectively enriching each other to regulate luminance
and high- light structural variations in real-world scenarios. A Mixture of
Experts (MoE)-based Feed-Forward Network (FFN) enhances contextual learning,
with a gating mechanism conditionally activating the top K experts for
specialized processing. To address overfitting in LLIE methods caused by
distinct light patterns in benchmarking datasets, we enhance the HISA-MSA
module with low-rank matrix adaptations (LoRA). Extensive qualitative and
quantitative evaluations across multiple specialized datasets demonstrate that
ISALux is competitive with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Addition- ally, an
ablation study highlights the contribution of each component in the proposed
model. Code will be released upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示优化方法主要针对纯文本场景，扩展到多模态任务时面临视觉标记膨胀和过程级监督缺失两大挑战，需要专门的多模态优化框架

Method: 采用EM式优化过程解耦反馈建模和提示优化，引入短长期记忆机制：历史反馈缓解上下文限制，历史提示提供方向性指导

Result: 在文本、图像和视频基准测试中均取得一致性能提升，建立了高效可迁移的提示优化统一框架

Conclusion: UniAPO成功解决了多模态提示优化的核心挑战，为多模态任务提供了稳定、目标驱动的自动提示优化解决方案

Abstract: Prompting is fundamental to unlocking the full potential of large language
models. To automate and enhance this process, automatic prompt optimization
(APO) has been developed, demonstrating effectiveness primarily in text-only
input scenarios. However, extending existing APO methods to multimodal tasks,
such as video-language generation introduces two core challenges: (i) visual
token inflation, where long visual token sequences restrict context capacity
and result in insufficient feedback signals; (ii) a lack of process-level
supervision, as existing methods focus on outcome-level supervision and
overlook intermediate supervision, limiting prompt optimization. We present
UniAPO: Unified Multimodal Automated Prompt Optimization, the first framework
tailored for multimodal APO. UniAPO adopts an EM-inspired optimization process
that decouples feedback modeling and prompt refinement, making the optimization
more stable and goal-driven. To further address the aforementioned challenges,
we introduce a short-long term memory mechanism: historical feedback mitigates
context limitations, while historical prompts provide directional guidance for
effective prompt optimization. UniAPO achieves consistent gains across text,
image, and video benchmarks, establishing a unified framework for efficient and
transferable prompt optimization.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a foundational component for 3D reconstruction in
minimally invasive endoscopic surgeries. However, existing monocular depth
estimation techniques often exhibit limited performance to the varying
illumination and complex textures of the surgical environment. While powerful
visual foundation models offer a promising solution, their training on natural
images leads to significant domain adaptability limitations and semantic
perception deficiencies when applied to endoscopy. In this study, we introduce
EndoUFM, an unsupervised monocular depth estimation framework that innovatively
integrating dual foundation models for surgical scenes, which enhance the depth
estimation performance by leveraging the powerful pre-learned priors. The
framework features a novel adaptive fine-tuning strategy that incorporates
Random Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (RVLoRA) to enhance model adaptability, and a
Residual block based on Depthwise Separable Convolution (Res-DSC) to improve
the capture of fine-grained local features. Furthermore, we design a
mask-guided smoothness loss to enforce depth consistency within anatomical
tissue structures. Extensive experiments on the SCARED, Hamlyn, SERV-CT, and
EndoNeRF datasets confirm that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
while maintaining an efficient model size. This work contributes to augmenting
surgeons' spatial perception during minimally invasive procedures, thereby
enhancing surgical precision and safety, with crucial implications for
augmented reality and navigation systems.

Abstract: Progress in remote PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (rPPG) is limited by the critical
issues of existing publicly available datasets: small size, privacy concerns
with facial videos, and lack of diversity in conditions. The paper introduces a
novel comprehensive large-scale multi-view video dataset for rPPG and health
biomarkers estimation. Our dataset comprises 3600 synchronized video recordings
from 600 subjects, captured under varied conditions (resting and post-exercise)
using multiple consumer-grade cameras at different angles. To enable multimodal
analysis of physiological states, each recording is paired with a 100 Hz PPG
signal and extended health metrics, such as electrocardiogram, arterial blood
pressure, biomarkers, temperature, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and
stress level. Using this data, we train an efficient rPPG model and compare its
quality with existing approaches in cross-dataset scenarios. The public release
of our dataset and model should significantly speed up the progress in the
development of AI medical assistants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长视频问答系统采用刚性管道，将推理与感知解耦，导致信息丢失或计算效率低下。核心问题在于无法根据特定推理需求自适应提取视觉信息

Method: CAVIA采用闭环系统，推理持续指导视觉提取。包含三个创新：分层推理指导精确定位、跨模态语义桥接进行目标提取、置信度驱动的迭代合成

Result: 在EgoSchema(65.7%, +5.3%)、NExT-QA(76.1%, +2.6%)和IntentQA(73.8%, +6.9%)等挑战性基准测试中达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 动态推理-感知协调为视频理解提供了可扩展的范式，证明了自适应视觉注意力分配的重要性

Abstract: Human video comprehension demonstrates dynamic coordination between reasoning
and visual attention, adaptively focusing on query-relevant details. However,
current long-form video question answering systems employ rigid pipelines that
decouple reasoning from perception, leading to either information loss through
premature visual abstraction or computational inefficiency through exhaustive
processing. The core limitation lies in the inability to adapt visual
extraction to specific reasoning requirements, different queries demand
fundamentally different visual evidence from the same video content. In this
work, we present CAVIA, a training-free framework that revolutionizes video
understanding through reasoning, perception coordination. Unlike conventional
approaches where visual processing operates independently of reasoning, CAVIA
creates a closed-loop system where reasoning continuously guides visual
extraction based on identified information gaps. CAVIA introduces three
innovations: (1) hierarchical reasoning, guided localization to precise frames;
(2) cross-modal semantic bridging for targeted extraction; (3)
confidence-driven iterative synthesis. CAVIA achieves state-of-the-art
performance on challenging benchmarks: EgoSchema (65.7%, +5.3%), NExT-QA
(76.1%, +2.6%), and IntentQA (73.8%, +6.9%), demonstrating that dynamic
reasoning-perception coordination provides a scalable paradigm for video
understanding.

Result: 对于所有几何形状，在轴向2D切片上训练的2D U-Net获得了最佳的MSE和SSIM值，表现优于2.5D和3D输入数据维度

Conclusion: 在稀疏采样条纹伪影校正任务中，2D U-Net在轴向切片上的性能最佳，表明在此特定任务中，2D方法比整合体积上下文信息的2.5D和3D方法更有效

Abstract: This study aims to investigate the effect of various beam geometries and
dimensions of input data on the sparse-sampling streak artifact correction task
with U-Nets for clinical CT scans as a means of incorporating the volumetric
context into artifact reduction tasks to improve model performance. A total of
22 subjects were retrospectively selected (01.2016-12.2018) from the Technical
University of Munich's research hospital, TUM Klinikum rechts der Isar.
Sparsely-sampled CT volumes were simulated with the Astra toolbox for parallel,
fan, and cone beam geometries. 2048 views were taken as full-view scans. 2D and
3D U-Nets were trained and validated on 14, and tested on 8 subjects,
respectively. For the dimensionality study, in addition to the 512x512 2D CT
images, the CT scans were further pre-processed to generate a so-called '2.5D',
and 3D data: Each CT volume was divided into 64x64x64 voxel blocks. The 3D data
refers to individual 64-voxel blocks. An axial, coronal, and sagittal cut
through the center of each block resulted in three 64x64 2D patches that were
rearranged as a single 64x64x3 image, proposed as 2.5D data. Model performance
was assessed with the mean squared error (MSE) and structural similarity index
measure (SSIM). For all geometries, the 2D U-Net trained on axial 2D slices
results in the best MSE and SSIM values, outperforming the 2.5D and 3D input
data dimensions.

Motivation: 现有的场景回归方法（如VGGT）在处理极端视角变化的图像时表现优异，但难以处理大量输入图像。为了解决这个问题，需要开发能够高效处理大规模场景的方法。

Method: 首先从锚点图像子集计算神经场景表示，然后对回归网络进行微调，使其能够基于该神经场景表示重建所有输入图像。

Result: 该方法不仅能够高效扩展到大规模场景，还在相机姿态估计和新视角合成基准测试（包括TUM-RGBD、CO3Dv2和Tanks & Temples）上取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: SAIL-Recon通过结合场景回归和视觉定位能力，成功解决了大规模SfM问题，在多个基准测试中表现出色，代码和模型已公开。

Abstract: Scene regression methods, such as VGGT, solve the Structure-from-Motion (SfM)
problem by directly regressing camera poses and 3D scene structures from input
images. They demonstrate impressive performance in handling images under
extreme viewpoint changes. However, these methods struggle to handle a large
number of input images. To address this problem, we introduce SAIL-Recon, a
feed-forward Transformer for large scale SfM, by augmenting the scene
regression network with visual localization capabilities. Specifically, our
method first computes a neural scene representation from a subset of anchor
images. The regression network is then fine-tuned to reconstruct all input
images conditioned on this neural scene representation. Comprehensive
experiments show that our method not only scales efficiently to large-scale
scenes, but also achieves state-of-the-art results on both camera pose
estimation and novel view synthesis benchmarks, including TUM-RGBD, CO3Dv2, and
Tanks & Temples. We will publish our model and code. Code and models are

Abstract: The use of computer vision in automotive is a trending research in which
safety and security are a primary concern. In particular, for autonomous
driving, preventing road accidents requires highly accurate object detection
under diverse conditions. To address this issue, recently the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) released the 8800 norm, providing
structured frameworks for managing associated AI relevant risks. However,
challenging scenarios such as adverse weather or low lighting often introduce
data drift, leading to degraded model performance and potential safety
violations. In this work, we present a novel hybrid computer vision
architecture trained with thousands of synthetic image data from the road
environment to improve robustness in unseen drifted environments. Our dual mode
framework utilized YOLO version 8 for swift detection and incorporated a
five-layer CNN for verification. The system functioned in sequence and improved
the detection accuracy by more than 90\% when tested with drift-augmented road
images. The focus was to demonstrate how such a hybrid model can provide better
road safety when working together in a hybrid structure.

Abstract: The increasing sophistication of image manipulation techniques demands robust
forensic solutions that can both reliably detect alterations and precisely
localize tampered regions. Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show
promise by leveraging world knowledge and semantic understanding for
context-aware detection, yet they struggle with perceiving subtle, low-level
forensic artifacts crucial for accurate manipulation localization. This paper
presents a novel Propose-Rectify framework that effectively bridges semantic
reasoning with forensic-specific analysis. In the proposal stage, our approach
utilizes a forensic-adapted LLaVA model to generate initial manipulation
analysis and preliminary localization of suspicious regions based on semantic
understanding and contextual reasoning. In the rectification stage, we
introduce a Forensics Rectification Module that systematically validates and
refines these initial proposals through multi-scale forensic feature analysis,
integrating technical evidence from several specialized filters. Additionally,
we present an Enhanced Segmentation Module that incorporates critical forensic
cues into SAM's encoded image embeddings, thereby overcoming inherent semantic
biases to achieve precise delineation of manipulated regions. By
synergistically combining advanced multimodal reasoning with established
forensic methodologies, our framework ensures that initial semantic proposals
are systematically validated and enhanced through concrete technical evidence,
resulting in comprehensive detection accuracy and localization precision.
Extensive experimental validation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
across diverse datasets with exceptional robustness and generalization
capabilities.

Motivation: 完全无监督异常检测(FUAD)是一个实际需求，但传统知识蒸馏方法在训练数据包含异常时会学习到异常表示，导致检测性能下降。

Method: 提出跨域蒸馏框架：1)域特定训练-将训练集划分为多个低异常率的域并训练域特定学生；2)跨域知识聚合-利用伪正常特征指导全局学生学习跨域的正常表示。

Result: 在MVTec AD和VisA数据集的噪声版本上实验表明，该方法相比基线取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 所提出的跨域蒸馏框架有效解决了FUAD设置下的异常检测问题，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Fully Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (FUAD) is a practical extension of
Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD), aiming to detect anomalies without any
labels even when the training set may contain anomalous samples. To achieve
FUAD, we pioneer the introduction of Knowledge Distillation (KD) paradigm based
on teacher-student framework into the FUAD setting. However, due to the
presence of anomalies in the training data, traditional KD methods risk
enabling the student to learn the teacher's representation of anomalies under
FUAD setting, thereby resulting in poor anomaly detection performance. To
address this issue, we propose a novel Cross-Domain Distillation (CDD)
framework based on the widely studied reverse distillation (RD) paradigm.
Specifically, we design a Domain-Specific Training, which divides the training
set into multiple domains with lower anomaly ratios and train a domain-specific
student for each. Cross-Domain Knowledge Aggregation is then performed, where
pseudo-normal features generated by domain-specific students collaboratively
guide a global student to learn generalized normal representations across all
samples. Experimental results on noisy versions of the MVTec AD and VisA
datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance
improvements over the baseline, validating its effectiveness under FUAD
setting.

Conclusion: 持续学习为医学影像视觉异常检测提供了一个自然有效的框架，能够适应数据分布变化同时保持模型性能，具有重要的应用潜力。

Abstract: Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) seeks to identify abnormal images and
precisely localize the corresponding anomalous regions, relying solely on
normal data during training. This approach has proven essential in domains such
as manufacturing and, more recently, in the medical field, where accurate and
explainable detection is critical. Despite its importance, the impact of
evolving input data distributions over time has received limited attention,
even though such changes can significantly degrade model performance. In
particular, given the dynamic and evolving nature of medical imaging data,
Continual Learning (CL) provides a natural and effective framework to
incrementally adapt models while preserving previously acquired knowledge. This
study explores for the first time the application of VAD models in a CL
scenario for the medical field. In this work, we utilize a CL version of the
well-established PatchCore model, called PatchCoreCL, and evaluate its
performance using BMAD, a real-world medical imaging dataset with both
image-level and pixel-level annotations. Our results demonstrate that
PatchCoreCL is an effective solution, achieving performance comparable to the
task-specific models, with a forgetting value less than a 1%, highlighting the
feasibility and potential of CL for adaptive VAD in medical imaging.

face cross-domain attributes. Looking at these limitations, we propose a
generic framework for craniofacial reconstruction from 2D X-ray images. Here,
we used various generative models (i.e., CycleGANs, cGANs, etc) and fine-tune
the generator and discriminator parts to generate more realistic images in two
distinct domains, which are the skull and face of an individual. This is the
first time where 2D X-rays are being used as a representation of the skull by
generative models for craniofacial reconstruction. We have evaluated the
quality of generated faces using FID, IS, and SSIM scores. Finally, we have
proposed a retrieval framework where the query is the generated face image and
the gallery is the database of real faces. By experimental results, we have
found that this can be an effective tool for forensic science.

TL;DR: 提出了Visual-CoG范式，通过三阶段奖励机制改进文本到图像生成，在多属性模糊提示处理上取得显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归模型在处理多属性和模糊文本提示时能力有限，且大多数模型只在生成结束时提供奖励信号，难以识别各阶段的贡献

Method: 提出Visual-CoG范式，包含语义推理、过程精炼和结果评估三个阶段，每个阶段都提供即时奖励指导

Result: 在GenEval、T2I-CompBench和VisCog-Bench基准测试上分别实现了15%、5%和19%的性能提升

Conclusion: Visual-CoG通过阶段感知的奖励机制有效提升了文本到图像生成的质量和推理能力，特别是在处理复杂提示方面表现优异

Abstract: Despite the promising progress of recent autoregressive models in
text-to-image (T2I) generation, their ability to handle multi-attribute and
ambiguous prompts remains limited. To address these limitations, existing works
have applied chain-of-thought (CoT) to enable stage-aware visual synthesis and
employed reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning capabilities.
However, most models provide reward signals only at the end of the generation
stage. This monolithic final-only guidance makes it difficult to identify which
stages contribute positively to the final outcome and may lead to suboptimal
policies. To tackle this issue, we propose a Visual-Chain of Guidance
(Visual-CoG) paradigm consisting of three stages: semantic reasoning, process
refining, and outcome evaluation, with stage-aware rewards providing immediate
guidance throughout the image generation pipeline. We further construct a
visual cognition benchmark, VisCog-Bench, which comprises four subtasks to
evaluate the effectiveness of semantic reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations on
GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and the proposed VisCog-Bench show improvements of 15%,
5%, and 19%, respectively, demonstrating the superior performance of the
proposed Visual-CoG. We will release all the resources soon.

TL;DR: ArgusCogito是一个基于视觉语言模型的零样本思维链框架，通过跨模态协同和全方位推理来解决伪装目标分割问题，在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法受限于浅层特征表示、推理机制不足和跨模态整合薄弱，导致目标分离不完整和分割不精确。受百眼巨人感知策略启发，需要开发能够进行深度整体理解的模型。

Method: 采用三阶段认知启发框架：1)猜想阶段-通过跨模态融合进行全局推理构建认知先验；2)聚焦阶段-进行全方位注意力驱动扫描和聚焦推理；3)雕刻阶段-在聚焦区域内迭代生成密集点提示来逐步雕刻高保真分割掩码。

Result: 在四个COS基准测试和三个医学图像分割基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，验证了框架的卓越效能、优越泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ArgusCogito通过模拟百眼巨人的感知策略，成功解决了伪装目标分割的挑战，展示了跨模态协同和全方位推理在深度视觉理解中的有效性。

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS) poses a significant challenge due to
the intrinsic high similarity between targets and backgrounds, demanding models
capable of profound holistic understanding beyond superficial cues. Prevailing
methods, often limited by shallow feature representation, inadequate reasoning
mechanisms, and weak cross-modal integration, struggle to achieve this depth of
cognition, resulting in prevalent issues like incomplete target separation and
imprecise segmentation. Inspired by the perceptual strategy of the Hundred-eyed
Giant-emphasizing holistic observation, omnidirectional focus, and intensive
scrutiny-we introduce ArgusCogito, a novel zero-shot, chain-of-thought
framework underpinned by cross-modal synergy and omnidirectional reasoning
within Vision-Language Models (VLMs). ArgusCogito orchestrates three
cognitively-inspired stages: (1) Conjecture: Constructs a strong cognitive
prior through global reasoning with cross-modal fusion (RGB, depth, semantic
maps), enabling holistic scene understanding and enhanced target-background
disambiguation. (2) Focus: Performs omnidirectional, attention-driven scanning
and focused reasoning, guided by semantic priors from Conjecture, enabling
precise target localization and region-of-interest refinement. (3) Sculpting:
Progressively sculpts high-fidelity segmentation masks by integrating
cross-modal information and iteratively generating dense positive/negative
point prompts within focused regions, emulating Argus' intensive scrutiny.
Extensive evaluations on four challenging COS benchmarks and three Medical
Image Segmentation (MIS) benchmarks demonstrate that ArgusCogito achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, validating the framework's exceptional
efficacy, superior generalization capability, and robustness.

TL;DR: SegEarth-OV是首个用于遥感图像的无标注开放词汇分割框架，通过SimFeatUp上采样器和全局偏置缓解操作，有效利用预训练视觉语言模型的丰富语义，无需任务特定后训练即可实现精确分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像语义分割对地球观测至关重要，但新类别解释需求和昂贵的人工标注成本带来重大挑战。现有自然图像开放词汇分割框架难以处理遥感数据的尺度变化和细粒度细节，且依赖大量昂贵标注。

Method: 提出SegEarth-OV框架，包含SimFeatUp通用上采样器（恢复高分辨率空间细节）和全局偏置缓解操作（增强局部语义保真度）。针对SAR图像等模态，提出AlignEarth知识蒸馏策略，将光学VLM编码器语义知识转移到SAR编码器。

Result: 在光学和SAR数据集上的大量实验表明，SegEarth-OV相比最先进方法实现了显著改进，为无标注和开放世界地球观测建立了坚实基础。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了遥感图像开放词汇分割的关键挑战，无需标注即可实现精确分割，并扩展到多传感器类型，为地球观测提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing (RS) images is pivotal for
comprehensive Earth observation, but the demand for interpreting new object
categories, coupled with the high expense of manual annotation, poses
significant challenges. Although open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS)
offers a promising solution, existing frameworks designed for natural images
are insufficient for the unique complexities of RS data. They struggle with
vast scale variations and fine-grained details, and their adaptation often
relies on extensive, costly annotations. To address this critical gap, this
paper introduces SegEarth-OV, the first framework for annotation-free
open-vocabulary segmentation of RS images. Specifically, we propose SimFeatUp,
a universal upsampler that robustly restores high-resolution spatial details
from coarse features, correcting distorted target shapes without any
task-specific post-training. We also present a simple yet effective Global Bias
Alleviation operation to subtract the inherent global context from patch
features, significantly enhancing local semantic fidelity. These components
empower SegEarth-OV to effectively harness the rich semantics of pre-trained
VLMs, making OVSS possible in optical RS contexts. Furthermore, to extend the
framework's universality to other challenging RS modalities like SAR images,
where large-scale VLMs are unavailable and expensive to create, we introduce
AlignEarth, which is a distillation-based strategy and can efficiently transfer
semantic knowledge from an optical VLM encoder to an SAR encoder, bypassing the
need to build SAR foundation models from scratch and enabling universal OVSS
across diverse sensor types. Extensive experiments on both optical and SAR
datasets validate that SegEarth-OV can achieve dramatic improvements over the
SOTA methods, establishing a robust foundation for annotation-free and
open-world Earth observation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EventTracer是一个基于路径追踪的渲染管道，通过低采样路径追踪和轻量级事件脉冲网络，高效模拟高保真事件序列，填补了事件视觉模拟与真实数据之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事件流模拟方法通常使用无噪声RGB帧，渲染成本高且时间分辨率低（100-300 FPS），远低于真实事件数据。需要一种高效、物理感知的方法来生成大规模、高时间频率的事件数据。

Method: 采用低采样路径追踪加速渲染过程，训练轻量级事件脉冲网络将降噪RGB视频转换为真实事件序列。网络使用双极性泄漏积分发射(BiLIF)脉冲单元和双向地球移动距离(EMD)损失函数来捕捉事件流的物理特性。

Result: EventTracer管道以约4分钟/秒的速度生成720p视频，继承了路径追踪的精确时空建模优势。在两个下游任务中显示比其它事件模拟器能更好地捕捉场景细节，与真实事件数据相似度更高。

Conclusion: EventTracer是创建大规模事件-RGB数据集的有前景工具，能以低成本缩小事件视觉的模拟-真实差距，推动机器人、自动驾驶和VR/AR等应用场景的发展。

Abstract: Simulating event streams from 3D scenes has become a common practice in
event-based vision research, as it meets the demand for large-scale, high
temporal frequency data without setting up expensive hardware devices or
undertaking extensive data collections. Yet existing methods in this direction
typically work with noiseless RGB frames that are costly to render, and
therefore they can only achieve a temporal resolution equivalent to 100-300
FPS, far lower than that of real-world event data. In this work, we propose
EventTracer, a path tracing-based rendering pipeline that simulates
high-fidelity event sequences from complex 3D scenes in an efficient and
physics-aware manner. Specifically, we speed up the rendering process via low
sample-per-pixel (SPP) path tracing, and train a lightweight event spiking
network to denoise the resulting RGB videos into realistic event sequences. To
capture the physical properties of event streams, the network is equipped with
a bipolar leaky integrate-and-fired (BiLIF) spiking unit and trained with a
bidirectional earth mover distance (EMD) loss. Our EventTracer pipeline runs at
a speed of about 4 minutes per second of 720p video, and it inherits the merit
of accurate spatiotemporal modeling from its path tracing backbone. We show in
two downstream tasks that EventTracer captures better scene details and
demonstrates a greater similarity to real-world event data than other event
simulators, which establishes it as a promising tool for creating large-scale
event-RGB datasets at a low cost, narrowing the sim-to-real gap in event-based
vision, and boosting various application scenarios such as robotics, autonomous
driving, and VRAR.

Motivation: 现有的开放集高光谱图像分类方法主要专注于区分已知和未知类别样本并拒绝未知样本，但未能进一步识别或发现未知类别。

Method: 使用原型学习和聚类方法，通过少量标记样本推断未知类别的原型，在已知分类器拒绝未知样本后，根据与推断原型的距离将未知样本聚类到不同类别。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了开放集少样本高光谱图像分类中未知类别的发现和识别问题，优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: Open-set few-shot hyperspectral image (HSI) classification aims to classify
image pixels by using few labeled pixels per class, where the pixels to be
classified may be not all from the classes that have been seen. To address the
open-set HSI classification challenge, current methods focus mainly on
distinguishing the unknown class samples from the known class samples and
rejecting them to increase the accuracy of identifying known class samples.
They fails to further identify or discovery the unknow classes among the
samples. This paper proposes a prototype learning and clustering method for
discoverying unknown classes in HSIs under the few-shot environment. Using few
labeled samples, it strives to develop the ability of infering the prototypes
of unknown classes while distinguishing unknown classes from known classes.
Once the unknown class samples are rejected by the learned known class
classifier, the proposed method can further cluster the unknown class samples
into different classes according to their distance to the inferred unknown
class prototypes. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, extensive
experiments on four benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that our proposed method
exhibits competitive performance in open-set few-shot HSI classification tasks.

Conclusion: 这项工作为生成模型的未来研究做出了贡献并铺平了道路，成功统一了SGMs和SB问题，实现了两者的优势互补。

Abstract: This paper aims to unify Score-based Generative Models (SGMs), also known as
Diffusion models, and the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem through three
reparameterization techniques: Iterative Proportional Mean-Matching (IPMM),
Iterative Proportional Terminus-Matching (IPTM), and Iterative Proportional
Flow-Matching (IPFM). These techniques significantly accelerate and stabilize
the training of SB-based models. Furthermore, the paper introduces novel
initialization strategies that use pre-trained SGMs to effectively train
SB-based models. By using SGMs as initialization, we leverage the advantages of
both SB-based models and SGMs, ensuring efficient training of SB-based models
and further improving the performance of SGMs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the significant effectiveness and improvements of the proposed
methods. We believe this work contributes to and paves the way for future
research on generative models.

Motivation: CAM是深度学习模型可视化的重要方法，但其对不同噪声的鲁棒性尚未得到充分探索。本研究旨在评估各种CAM方法在不同噪声扰动下的弹性，分析噪声类型对CAM解释的影响。

Method: 通过分析不同噪声类型对CAM解释的影响，评估CAM对噪声的敏感性和数据集特征对解释稳定性的影响。提出了包含一致性和响应性两个维度的CAM鲁棒性度量指标，并在多个架构和数据集上进行实证评估。

Result: 研究发现不同CAM方法对噪声的敏感性存在显著差异。提出的鲁棒性度量指标能够有效捕捉CAM方法在输入扰动下的稳定性和敏感性特征。

Conclusion: CAM方法对噪声的鲁棒性存在较大差异，需要根据具体应用场景选择合适的CAM方法。提出的鲁棒性度量指标为评估CAM方法的稳定性提供了有效工具，有助于提高深度学习模型解释的可信度。

Abstract: Class Activation Maps (CAMs) are one of the important methods for visualizing
regions used by deep learning models. Yet their robustness to different noise
remains underexplored. In this work, we evaluate and report the resilience of
various CAM methods for different noise perturbations across multiple
architectures and datasets. By analyzing the influence of different noise types
on CAM explanations, we assess the susceptibility to noise and the extent to
which dataset characteristics may impact explanation stability. The findings
highlight considerable variability in noise sensitivity for various CAMs. We
propose a robustness metric for CAMs that captures two key properties:
consistency and responsiveness. Consistency reflects the ability of CAMs to
remain stable under input perturbations that do not alter the predicted class,
while responsiveness measures the sensitivity of CAMs to changes in the
prediction caused by such perturbations. The metric is evaluated empirically
across models, different perturbations, and datasets along with complementary
statistical tests to exemplify the applicability of our proposed approach.

editing methods across diverse diffusion, autoregressive, and hybrid generative
models, uncovering substantial performance disparities. To address a critical

hallucination, highlighting how leading models, such as GPT-4o, often
hallucinate the existence of a visual cue and erroneously perform the editing
task. Our code and benchmark are publicly released at

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are vital for training segmentation models, but
pixel-level labeling is time-consuming, error-prone, and often requires scarce
expert annotators, especially in medical imaging. In contrast, coarse
annotations are quicker, cheaper, and easier to produce, even by non-experts.
In this paper, we propose to use coarse drawings from both positive (target)
and negative (background) classes in the image, even with noisy pixels, to
train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation. We
present a method for learning the true segmentation label distributions from
purely noisy coarse annotations using two coupled CNNs. The separation of the
two CNNs is achieved by high fidelity with the characters of the noisy training
annotations. We propose to add a complementary label learning that encourages
estimating negative label distribution. To illustrate the properties of our
method, we first use a toy segmentation dataset based on MNIST. We then present
the quantitative results of experiments using publicly available datasets:
Cityscapes dataset for multi-class segmentation, and retinal images for medical
applications. In all experiments, our method outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in the cases where the ratio of coarse annotations is
small compared to the given dense annotations.

Conclusion: BRAIN方法有效解决了脑信号表示偏移和累积偏差问题，通过持续学习框架显著提升了视觉-脑理解模型的稳定性和性能

Abstract: Memory decay makes it harder for the human brain to recognize visual objects
and retain details. Consequently, recorded brain signals become weaker,
uncertain, and contain poor visual context over time. This paper presents one
of the first vision-learning approaches to address this problem. First, we
statistically and experimentally demonstrate the existence of inconsistency in
brain signals and its impact on the Vision-Brain Understanding (VBU) model. Our
findings show that brain signal representations shift over recording sessions,
leading to compounding bias, which poses challenges for model learning and
degrades performance. Then, we propose a new Bias-Mitigation Continual Learning
(BRAIN) approach to address these limitations. In this approach, the model is
trained in a continual learning setup and mitigates the growing bias from each
learning step. A new loss function named De-bias Contrastive Learning is also
introduced to address the bias problem. In addition, to prevent catastrophic
forgetting, where the model loses knowledge from previous sessions, the new
Angular-based Forgetting Mitigation approach is introduced to preserve learned
knowledge in the model. Finally, the empirical experiments demonstrate that our
approach achieves State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance across various
benchmarks, surpassing prior and non-continual learning methods.

Abstract: Deep learning has transformed computer vision (CV), achieving outstanding
performance in classification, segmentation, and related tasks. Such AI-based
CV systems are becoming prevalent, with applications spanning from medical
imaging to surveillance. State of the art models such as convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) are often regarded as ``black
boxes,'' offering limited transparency into their decision-making processes.
Despite a recent advancement in explainable AI (XAI), explainability remains
underutilized in practical CV deployments. A primary obstacle is the absence of
integrated software solutions that connect XAI techniques with robust knowledge

*Ayce Idil Aytekin,Helge Rhodin,Rishabh Dabral,Christian Theobalt*

TL;DR: 提出基于扩散模型的单目RGB图像手持物体3D重建框架，利用手-物交互作为几何指导，通过推理时指导优化重建质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量后处理或重建质量低，需要直接从扩散过程生成高质量几何，同时确保合理的手-物交互

Method: 使用潜在扩散模型，以修复后的物体外观为条件，采用推理时指导优化。通过速度场监督和多模态几何线索（法线深度对齐、轮廓一致性、关键点重投影）同时优化手和物体的变换，并加入SDF监督和接触约束

Result: 在遮挡下产生准确、鲁棒和连贯的重建结果，在野外场景中泛化良好

Conclusion: 该方法通过扩散过程中的优化指导设计，实现了高质量的手持物体3D重建，解决了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for reconstructing 3D geometry
of hand-held objects from monocular RGB images by leveraging hand-object
interaction as geometric guidance. Our method conditions a latent diffusion
model on an inpainted object appearance and uses inference-time guidance to
optimize the object reconstruction, while simultaneously ensuring plausible
hand-object interactions. Unlike prior methods that rely on extensive
post-processing or produce low-quality reconstructions, our approach directly
generates high-quality object geometry during the diffusion process by
introducing guidance with an optimization-in-the-loop design. Specifically, we
guide the diffusion model by applying supervision to the velocity field while
simultaneously optimizing the transformations of both the hand and the object
being reconstructed. This optimization is driven by multi-modal geometric cues,
including normal and depth alignment, silhouette consistency, and 2D keypoint
reprojection. We further incorporate signed distance field supervision and
enforce contact and non-intersection constraints to ensure physical
plausibility of hand-object interaction. Our method yields accurate, robust and
coherent reconstructions under occlusion while generalizing well to in-the-wild
scenarios.

TL;DR: GM-Skip是一个用于Transformer块跳过的灵活框架，通过度量引导的贪婪选择和反向删除机制，在保持输出质量的同时加速视觉语言模型的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的视觉语言模型虽然性能出色，但计算成本高，难以在延迟敏感的应用（如自动驾驶）中部署，需要一种既能加速推理又能保持性能的方法。

Method: 采用度量引导的贪婪块选择策略，利用度量反馈识别冗余层，结合反向顺序删除机制保留早期基础块，并通过可调节的稀疏度-性能平衡目标来适应不同部署需求。

Result: 在COCO数据集上，GM-Skip将Person类别的单目标分类准确率从19.1%提升到87.3%，同时跳过超过40%的Transformer块。在自动驾驶系统中实现高达45.4%的延迟降低。

Conclusion: GM-Skip框架有效加速了视觉语言模型的推理速度，同时保持了任务性能，在实际部署中验证了其配置的有效性和实用价值。

Abstract: Transformer-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive
performance on tasks such as image captioning, object recognition, and visual
reasoning, but their high computational cost hinders deployment in
latency-sensitive applications like autonomous driving. We introduce GM-Skip, a
flexible and metric-adaptive framework for Transformer block skipping that
accelerates VLM inference while preserving output quality. GM-Skip features a
greedy, metric-guided block selection strategy that uses metric feedback (e.g.,
accuracy, CIDEr) to identify redundant layers, along with a reverse-order
deletion mechanism that preserves early foundational blocks to avoid
performance collapse. To support diverse deployment needs, it incorporates a
tunable trade-off between sparsity and performance via a score-sparsity balance
objective. Experiments across multiple tasks and datasets, including COCO and
CODA, show that GM-Skip consistently improves inference speed while maintaining
task performance. On the COCO dataset, GM-Skip improves single-object
classification accuracy on the Person category from 19.1 percent to 87.3
percent while skipping more than 40 percent of Transformer blocks. In
real-world deployment, it achieves up to 45.4 percent latency reduction on
single-object detection when integrated into an autonomous vehicle running
Autoware.Universe, validating the effectiveness of its skip configurations and
confirming its practical value in accelerating real-world inference.

TL;DR: SKD-CAG方法通过自知识蒸馏和交叉注意力引导，选择性消除文本到图像扩散模型中的后门攻击，在保持图像质量的同时有效防御像素和风格后门攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型容易受到后门攻击，攻击者可以通过注入不可察觉的文本触发器来操纵模型输出。虽然分类模型中的文本后门防御已有研究，但生成模型缺乏有效的缓解技术。

Method: 提出自知识蒸馏与交叉注意力引导(SKD-CAG)方法，利用知识蒸馏引导模型修正对中毒提示的响应，同时通过交叉注意力机制在注意力层面消除后门影响，保持模型在无触发器时的干净输出能力。

Result: 实验表明该方法优于现有方法，对像素后门的去除准确率达到100%，对基于风格攻击的去除准确率达到93%，且不牺牲鲁棒性或图像保真度。

Conclusion: 定向遗忘是保护生成模型安全的有前途的防御策略，SKD-CAG方法有效解决了文本到图像扩散模型的后门安全问题。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized generative AI, but their
vulnerability to backdoor attacks poses significant security risks. Adversaries
can inject imperceptible textual triggers into training data, causing models to
generate manipulated outputs. Although text-based backdoor defenses in
classification models are well-explored, generative models lack effective
mitigation techniques against. We address this by selectively erasing the
model's learned associations between adversarial text triggers and poisoned
outputs, while preserving overall generation quality. Our approach,
Self-Knowledge Distillation with Cross-Attention Guidance (SKD-CAG), uses
knowledge distillation to guide the model in correcting responses to poisoned
prompts while maintaining image quality by exploiting the fact that the
backdoored model still produces clean outputs in the absence of triggers. Using
the cross-attention mechanism, SKD-CAG neutralizes backdoor influences at the
attention level, ensuring the targeted removal of adversarial effects.
Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches,
achieving removal accuracy 100\% for pixel backdoors and 93\% for style-based
attacks, without sacrificing robustness or image fidelity. Our findings
highlight targeted unlearning as a promising defense to secure generative
models. Code and model weights can be found at

TL;DR: LanSE是一个新的可解释评估框架，通过识别可解释的视觉模式并用自然语言描述，为AI生成内容提供细粒度评估，包括提示匹配、视觉真实感、物理合理性和内容多样性四个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成内容（如合成图像）的质量评估指标过于粗粒度，无法识别具体优缺点，限制了模型选择和科学理解。需要更细粒度的可解释评估方法。

Method: 提出Language-Grounded Sparse Encoders (LanSE)架构，通过大规模人工评估（超过11,000个标注）和多模态模型分析，识别可解释的视觉模式并自动用自然语言描述。

Result: LanSE在自然图像中检测可解释视觉模式的准确率超过93%，能够揭示现有指标无法发现的模型细微差异，如FLUX的物理合理性优势和SDXL-medium的内容多样性优势。

Conclusion: LanSE通过将可解释性与实际评估需求结合，为生成式AI用户提供了强大的模型选择、合成内容质量控制和模型改进工具，有助于建立公众对AI生成内容的信心和安全。

Abstract: While the quality of AI-generated contents, such as synthetic images, has
become remarkably high, current evaluation metrics provide only coarse-grained
assessments, failing to identify specific strengths and weaknesses that
researchers and practitioners need for model selection and development, further
limiting the scientific understanding and commercial deployment of these
generative models. To address this, we introduce Language-Grounded Sparse
Encoders (LanSE), a novel architecture that creates interpretable evaluation
metrics by identifying interpretable visual patterns and automatically
describing them in natural language. Through large-scale human evaluation (more
than 11,000 annotations) and large multimodal model (LMM) based analysis, LanSE
demonstrates reliable capabilities to detect interpretable visual patterns in
synthetic images with more than 93\% accuracy in natural images. LanSE further
provides a fine-grained evaluation framework that quantifies four key
dimensions of generation quality, prompt match, visual realism, physical
plausibility, and content diversity. LanSE reveals nuanced model differences
invisible to existing metrics, for instance, FLUX's superior physical
plausibility and SDXL-medium's strong content diversity, while aligning with
human judgments. By bridging interpretability with practical evaluation needs,
LanSE offers all users of generative AI models a powerful tool for model
selection, quality control of synthetic content, and model improvement. These
capabilities directly address the need for public confidence and safety in
AI-generated content, both critical for the future of generative AI
applications.

TL;DR: 提出一种轻量级Transformer模型，可从单相机2D关节点序列估计3D姿态，支持标定和非标定场景，通过掩码机制处理缺失先验信息，在计算效率和精度上均有显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D姿态估计方法对相机标定和完整先验信息的依赖，开发一个能在不同部署场景（从实验室标定环境到野外无标定视频）中通用的轻量级解决方案

Method: 使用Transformer架构，输入包括2D关节点序列、骨骼段长度和相机内参等几何先验，通过掩码机制处理缺失先验，在AMASS数据集上训练并生成合成2D数据

Result: 平均3D关节中心位置估计精度达到36mm，比现有技术提升0.5厘米，计算效率高（GPU 380μs，CPU 1800μs），在完整和缺失先验情况下均优于专家模型

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个高效、通用的3D姿态估计解决方案，特别适合嵌入式平台和低功耗设备部署，在保持高精度的同时显著降低了计算成本

Abstract: This paper proposes a new lightweight Transformer-based lifter that maps
short sequences of human 2D joint positions to 3D poses using a single camera.
The proposed model takes as input geometric priors including segment lengths
and camera intrinsics and is designed to operate in both calibrated and
uncalibrated settings. To this end, a masking mechanism enables the model to
ignore missing priors during training and inference. This yields a single
versatile network that can adapt to different deployment scenarios, from fully
calibrated lab environments to in-the-wild monocular videos without
calibration. The model was trained using 3D keypoints from AMASS dataset with
corresponding 2D synthetic data generated by sampling random camera poses and
intrinsics. It was then compared to an expert model trained, only on complete
priors, and the validation was done by conducting an ablation study. Results
show that both, camera and segment length priors, improve performance and that
the versatile model outperforms the expert, even when all priors are available,
and maintains high accuracy when priors are missing. Overall the average 3D
joint center positions estimation accuracy was as low as 36mm improving state
of the art by half a centimeter and at a much lower computational cost. Indeed,
the proposed model runs in 380$\mu$s on GPU and 1800$\mu$s on CPU, making it
suitable for deployment on embedded platforms and low-power devices.

TL;DR: GSVisLoc是一种基于3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)场景表示的视觉定位方法，通过粗匹配、精匹配和姿态细化三个步骤，实现无需修改、重训练或额外参考图像的相机位姿估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉定位方法通常需要复杂的场景表示或大量参考图像，而3DGS作为一种新兴的显式3D表示方法，具有高效渲染的优势，但尚未充分应用于视觉定位任务。

Method: 方法分为三个步骤：1) 通过对3D高斯进行下采样和编码生成场景特征；2) 编码图像块获取图像特征；3) 通过粗匹配、精匹配和姿态细化实现稳健的特征匹配和精确的位姿估计。

Result: 在室内外场景的标准基准测试中表现出竞争性的定位性能，优于现有的3DGS基线方法，且能够有效泛化到新场景而无需额外训练。

Conclusion: GSVisLoc成功地将3DGS场景表示应用于视觉定位任务，证明了其在不修改场景表示、不重训练且无需额外参考图像的情况下实现高效定位的能力，为3DGS在更多视觉任务中的应用开辟了道路。

Abstract: We introduce GSVisLoc, a visual localization method designed for 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) scene representations. Given a 3DGS model of a scene and a
query image, our goal is to estimate the camera's position and orientation. We
accomplish this by robustly matching scene features to image features. Scene
features are produced by downsampling and encoding the 3D Gaussians while image
features are obtained by encoding image patches. Our algorithm proceeds in
three steps, starting with coarse matching, then fine matching, and finally by
applying pose refinement for an accurate final estimate. Importantly, our
method leverages the explicit 3DGS scene representation for visual localization
without requiring modifications, retraining, or additional reference images. We
evaluate GSVisLoc on both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating competitive
localization performance on standard benchmarks while outperforming existing
3DGS-based baselines. Moreover, our approach generalizes effectively to novel
scenes without additional training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过多模态覆盖准则优化视觉token选择，在保持VLMs性能的同时大幅提升推理效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉token剪枝方法仅使用单模态信息，忽视了视视语言任务的多模态特性，导致token选择效果不佳

Method: 提出MMTok方法，将子集选择形式化为最大覆盖问题，同时覆盖文本token和原始视觉token集，使用VLM代理提升文本token质量

Result: 在POPE数据集上实现1.87倍速度提升，保持98.7%原始性能；仅4个token下仍保持87.7%性能

Conclusion: 多模态信息在token选择中具有补充性，覆盖准则是一种高效的通用token选择方法

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive performance in
understanding visual content with language instruction by converting visual
input to vision tokens. However, redundancy in vision tokens results in the
degenerated inference efficiency of VLMs. While many algorithms have been
proposed to reduce the number of vision tokens, most of them apply only
unimodal information (i.e., vision/text) for pruning and ignore the inherent
multimodal property of vision-language tasks. Moreover, it lacks a generic
criterion that can be applied to different modalities. To mitigate this
limitation, in this work, we propose to leverage both vision and text tokens to
select informative vision tokens by the criterion of coverage. We first
formulate the subset selection problem as a maximum coverage problem.
Afterward, a subset of vision tokens is optimized to cover the text tokens and
the original set of vision tokens, simultaneously. Finally, a VLM agent can be
adopted to further improve the quality of text tokens for guiding vision
pruning. The proposed method MMTok is extensively evaluated on benchmark
datasets with different VLMs. The comparison illustrates that vision and text
information are complementary, and combining multimodal information can surpass
the unimodal baseline with a clear margin. Moreover, under the maximum coverage
criterion on the POPE dataset, our method achieves a 1.87x speedup while
maintaining 98.7% of the original performance on LLaVA-NeXT-13B. Furthermore,
with only four vision tokens, it still preserves 87.7% of the original
performance on LLaVA-1.5-7B. These results highlight the effectiveness of
coverage in token selection.

Conclusion: InternVL 3.5通过创新的训练框架和效率优化技术，实现了性能与效率的双重提升，为开源多模态模型树立了新标杆，所有模型和代码均已公开。

Abstract: We introduce InternVL 3.5, a new family of open-source multimodal models that
significantly advances versatility, reasoning capability, and inference
efficiency along the InternVL series. A key innovation is the Cascade
Reinforcement Learning (Cascade RL) framework, which enhances reasoning through
a two-stage process: offline RL for stable convergence and online RL for
refined alignment. This coarse-to-fine training strategy leads to substantial
improvements on downstream reasoning tasks, e.g., MMMU and MathVista. To
optimize efficiency, we propose a Visual Resolution Router (ViR) that
dynamically adjusts the resolution of visual tokens without compromising
performance. Coupled with ViR, our Decoupled Vision-Language Deployment (DvD)
strategy separates the vision encoder and language model across different GPUs,
effectively balancing computational load. These contributions collectively
enable InternVL3.5 to achieve up to a +16.0\% gain in overall reasoning
performance and a 4.05$\times$ inference speedup compared to its predecessor,
i.e., InternVL3. In addition, InternVL3.5 supports novel capabilities such as
GUI interaction and embodied agency. Notably, our largest model, i.e.,
InternVL3.5-241B-A28B, attains state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs
across general multimodal, reasoning, text, and agentic tasks -- narrowing the
performance gap with leading commercial models like GPT-5. All models and code

Conclusion: 该方法在真实世界3D编辑应用中展现出强大的实际部署潜力，为解决3D修复中的一致性问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D inpainting often relies on multi-view 2D image inpainting, where the
inherent inconsistencies across different inpainted views can result in blurred
textures, spatial discontinuities, and distracting visual artifacts. These
inconsistencies pose significant challenges when striving for accurate and
realistic 3D object completion, particularly in applications that demand high
fidelity and structural coherence. To overcome these limitations, we propose
ObjFiller-3D, a novel method designed for the completion and editing of
high-quality and consistent 3D objects. Instead of employing a conventional 2D
image inpainting model, our approach leverages a curated selection of
state-of-the-art video editing model to fill in the masked regions of 3D
objects. We analyze the representation gap between 3D and videos, and propose
an adaptation of a video inpainting model for 3D scene inpainting. In addition,
we introduce a reference-based 3D inpainting method to further enhance the
quality of reconstruction. Experiments across diverse datasets show that
compared to previous methods, ObjFiller-3D produces more faithful and
fine-grained reconstructions (PSNR of 26.6 vs. NeRFiller (15.9) and LPIPS of
0.19 vs. Instant3dit (0.25)). Moreover, it demonstrates strong potential for
practical deployment in real-world 3D editing applications. Project page:

Method: 提出了增强型基于规则框架，包含语速归一化、多级声学特征分析和分层决策结构，并展示了如何与现代机器学习管道集成。

Result: 基于规则系统在延长音检测方面表现优异（97-99%准确率），在不同语速下提供稳定性能，在临床环境中具有独特优势。

Abstract: Stuttering affects approximately 1% of the global population, impacting
communication and quality of life. While recent advances in deep learning have
pushed the boundaries of automatic speech dysfluency detection, rule-based
approaches remain crucial for clinical applications where interpretability and
transparency are paramount. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of
rule-based stuttering detection systems, synthesizing insights from multiple
corpora including UCLASS, FluencyBank, and SEP-28k. We propose an enhanced
rule-based framework that incorporates speaking-rate normalization, multi-level
acoustic feature analysis, and hierarchical decision structures. Our approach
achieves competitive performance while maintaining complete
interpretability-critical for clinical adoption. We demonstrate that rule-based
systems excel particularly in prolongation detection (97-99% accuracy) and
provide stable performance across varying speaking rates. Furthermore, we show
how these interpretable models can be integrated with modern machine learning
pipelines as proposal generators or constraint modules, bridging the gap
between traditional speech pathology practices and contemporary AI systems. Our
analysis reveals that while neural approaches may achieve marginally higher
accuracy in unconstrained settings, rule-based methods offer unique advantages
in clinical contexts where decision auditability, patient-specific tuning, and
real-time feedback are essential.

Abstract: Understanding the factors that shape students' mathematics performance is
vital for designing effective educational policies. This study applies
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to PISA 2018 data to
predict math achievement and identify key predictors across ten countries
(67,329 students). We tested four models: Multiple Linear Regression (MLR),
Random Forest (RF), CATBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), using
student, family, and school variables. Models were trained on 70% of the data
(with 5-fold cross-validation) and tested on 30%, stratified by country.
Performance was assessed with R^2 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). To ensure
interpretability, we used feature importance, SHAP values, and decision tree
visualizations. Non-linear models, especially RF and ANN, outperformed MLR,
with RF balancing accuracy and generalizability. Key predictors included
socio-economic status, study time, teacher motivation, and students' attitudes
toward mathematics, though their impact varied across countries. Visual
diagnostics such as scatterplots of predicted vs actual scores showed RF and
CATBoost aligned closely with actual performance. Findings highlight the
non-linear and context-dependent nature of achievement and the value of XAI in
educational research. This study uncovers cross-national patterns, informs
equity-focused reforms, and supports the development of personalized learning
strategies.

Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在ICD编码方面虽准确率高，但缺乏可解释性，影响临床信任。现有方法主要依赖注意力机制和定性评估，缺乏系统性的定量评估和专门的解释生成方法。

Method: 1) 构建新的高质量标注数据集；2) 从忠实度(模型推理反映程度)和合理性(与专家判断一致性)两个维度评估解释性；3) 利用LLM生成解释作为远程监督信号；4) 提出新的解释学习方法。

Conclusion: LLM生成的解释在ICD编码任务中表现出色，结合少量人工标注可以显著提升模型解释的质量和可信度，为临床可解释AI提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Automated clinical coding involves mapping unstructured text from Electronic
Health Records (EHRs) to standardized code systems such as the International
Classification of Diseases (ICD). While recent advances in deep learning have
significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of ICD coding, the lack of
explainability in these models remains a major limitation, undermining trust
and transparency. Current explorations about explainability largely rely on
attention-based techniques and qualitative assessments by physicians, yet lack
systematic evaluation using consistent criteria on high-quality rationale
datasets, as well as dedicated approaches explicitly trained to generate
rationales for further enhancing explanation. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of the explainability of the rationales for ICD coding
through two key lenses: faithfulness that evaluates how well explanations
reflect the model's actual reasoning and plausibility that measures how
consistent the explanations are with human expert judgment. To facilitate the
evaluation of plausibility, we construct a new rationale-annotated dataset,
offering denser annotations with diverse granularity and aligns better with
current clinical practice, and conduct evaluation across three types of
rationales of ICD coding. Encouraged by the promising plausibility of
LLM-generated rationales for ICD coding, we further propose new rationale
learning methods to improve the quality of model-generated rationales, where
rationales produced by prompting LLMs with/without annotation examples are used
as distant supervision signals. We empirically find that LLM-generated
rationales align most closely with those of human experts. Moreover,
incorporating few-shot human-annotated examples not only further improves
rationale generation but also enhances rationale-learning approaches.

TL;DR: PuzzleJAX是一个GPU加速的益智游戏引擎和描述语言，支持快速基准测试树搜索、强化学习和LLM推理能力，能够动态编译数千种PuzzleScript游戏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GPU加速学习环境只能提供固定游戏的硬编码实现，缺乏灵活性。PuzzleJAX旨在支持动态编译任何可用其领域特定语言表达的游戏，覆盖更广泛的人类相关任务空间。

Method: 基于流行的PuzzleScript在线游戏引擎设计领域特定语言(DSL)，支持动态游戏编译。验证了数百个自2013年以来由专业设计师和业余创作者设计的PuzzleScript游戏。

Result: PuzzleJAX能够自然表达既简单直观又极具挑战性的任务，这些任务需要控制、规划和高层次洞察力的结合。

Conclusion: PuzzleJAX提供了一个扩展性强、表达力丰富且与人类相关的任务空间，适用于搜索、学习和语言模型的性能分析基准测试。

Abstract: We introduce PuzzleJAX, a GPU-accelerated puzzle game engine and description
language designed to support rapid benchmarking of tree search, reinforcement
learning, and LLM reasoning abilities. Unlike existing GPU-accelerated learning
environments that provide hard-coded implementations of fixed sets of games,
PuzzleJAX allows dynamic compilation of any game expressible in its
domain-specific language (DSL). This DSL follows PuzzleScript, which is a
popular and accessible online game engine for designing puzzle games. In this
paper, we validate in PuzzleJAX several hundred of the thousands of games
designed in PuzzleScript by both professional designers and casual creators
since its release in 2013, thereby demonstrating PuzzleJAX's coverage of an
expansive, expressive, and human-relevant space of tasks. By analyzing the
performance of search, learning, and language models on these games, we show
that PuzzleJAX can naturally express tasks that are both simple and intuitive
to understand, yet often deeply challenging to master, requiring a combination
of control, planning, and high-level insight.

*Shayan Vassef,Soorya Ram Shimegekar,Abhay Goyal,Koustuv Saha,Pi Zonooz,Navin Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种医疗首位的框架，利用单个视觉-语言模型（VLM）在两种补充角色中：作为模型卡片匹配器路由图像，以及细调后的专科模型处理多个下游任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床工作流程分散且效率低下，缺乏数据驱动的模型识别和标准化输出交付，导致运营成本高。

Method: 使用单个VLM在三阶段工作流程中路由图像（措施模态->主要异常->模型卡片ID），通过阶段性提示和答案选择器提高准确性。同时细调VLM处理专科内的多个任务。

Result: 在消化内科、血液学、眼科学和病理学领域，单模型部署表现等同或接近专门基准线。

Conclusion: 该方法证明一个VLM既能决策又能执行，可降低数据科学家工作量、简化监控、提高选模透明度并降低集成成本。

Abstract: Clinical workflows are fragmented as a patchwork of scripts and task-specific
networks that often handle triage, task selection, and model deployment. These
pipelines are rarely streamlined for data science pipeline, reducing efficiency
and raising operational costs. Workflows also lack data-driven model
identification (from imaging/tabular inputs) and standardized delivery of model
outputs. In response, we present a practical, healthcare-first framework that
uses a single vision-language model (VLM) in two complementary roles. First
(Solution 1), the VLM acts as an aware model-card matcher that routes an
incoming image to the appropriate specialist model via a three-stage workflow
(modality -> primary abnormality -> model-card id). Checks are provided by (i)
stagewise prompts that allow early exit via None/Normal/Other and (ii) a
stagewise answer selector that arbitrates between the top-2 candidates at each
stage, reducing the chance of an incorrect selection and aligning the workflow
with clinical risk tolerance. Second (Solution 2), we fine-tune the VLM on
specialty-specific datasets ensuring a single model covers multiple downstream
tasks within each specialty, maintaining performance while simplifying
deployment. Across gastroenterology, hematology, ophthalmology, and pathology,
our single-model deployment matches or approaches specialized baselines.
  Compared with pipelines composed of many task-specific agents, this approach
shows that one VLM can both decide and do. It may reduce effort by data
scientists, shorten monitoring, increase the transparency of model selection
(with per-stage justifications), and lower integration overhead.

*Katherine Atwell,Pedram Heydari,Anthony Sicilia,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出使用贝叶斯框架来量化LLM中的谄媚行为，通过测量与理性行为的偏差来区分理性与非理性更新，适用于无真实标签的任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要通过行为变化或准确率来衡量谄媚行为，但无法表征理性变化，且准确率方法仅适用于有真实标签的场景。需要一种能处理不确定性任务的新方法。

Method: 采用贝叶斯框架，将谄媚行为定义为面对用户观点时与理性行为的偏差。研究3个不同任务、开源和闭源LLM，使用多种方法探测谄媚行为和概率判断。

Result: 发现：1）LLM不具备贝叶斯理性；2）探测谄媚会导致预测后验概率显著偏向引导结果；3）谄媚有时增加贝叶斯误差，少数情况下减少误差；4）谄媚引起的贝叶斯误差变化与Brier分数相关性不强。

Conclusion: 仅研究谄媚对真实标签的影响不能完全捕捉推理错误，贝叶斯框架能更好地量化谄媚行为，特别是在不确定性和无真实标签的场景中。

Abstract: Sycophancy, or overly agreeable or flattering behavior, is a documented issue
in large language models (LLMs), and is critical to understand in the context
of human/AI collaboration. Prior works typically quantify sycophancy by
measuring shifts in behavior or impacts on accuracy, but neither metric
characterizes shifts in rationality, and accuracy measures can only be used in
scenarios with a known ground truth. In this work, we utilize a Bayesian
framework to quantify sycophancy as deviations from rational behavior when
presented with user perspectives, thus distinguishing between rational and
irrational updates based on the introduction of user perspectives. In
comparison to other methods, this approach allows us to characterize excessive
behavioral shifts, even for tasks that involve inherent uncertainty or do not
have a ground truth. We study sycophancy for 3 different tasks, a combination
of open-source and closed LLMs, and two different methods for probing
sycophancy. We also experiment with multiple methods for eliciting probability
judgments from LLMs. We hypothesize that probing LLMs for sycophancy will cause
deviations in LLMs' predicted posteriors that will lead to increased Bayesian
error. Our findings indicate that: 1) LLMs are not Bayesian rational, 2)
probing for sycophancy results in significant increases to the predicted
posterior in favor of the steered outcome, 3) sycophancy sometimes results in
increased Bayesian error, and in a small number of cases actually decreases
error, and 4) changes in Bayesian error due to sycophancy are not strongly
correlated in Brier score, suggesting that studying the impact of sycophancy on
ground truth alone does not fully capture errors in reasoning due to
sycophancy.

Method: 提出了RADAR半自动化方法，构建包含17,819个样本的基准数据集，包含图表、问题、推理步骤和归因标注，并引入基于图表的数学推理归因方法。

Result: 实验结果显示，推理引导的方法相比基线方法提高了15%的归因准确率，增强的归因能力也带来了更强的答案生成能力，平均BERTScore达到约0.90。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了向更可解释和可信的图表分析系统迈出的重要一步，使用户能够通过推理和归因来验证和理解模型决策。

Abstract: Data visualizations like charts are fundamental tools for quantitative
analysis and decision-making across fields, requiring accurate interpretation
and mathematical reasoning. The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) offers promising capabilities for automated visual data analysis, such
as processing charts, answering questions, and generating summaries. However,
they provide no visibility into which parts of the visual data informed their
conclusions; this black-box nature poses significant challenges to real-world
trust and adoption. In this paper, we take the first major step towards
evaluating and enhancing the capabilities of MLLMs to attribute their reasoning
process by highlighting the specific regions in charts and graphs that justify
model answers. To this end, we contribute RADAR, a semi-automatic approach to
obtain a benchmark dataset comprising 17,819 diverse samples with charts,
questions, reasoning steps, and attribution annotations. We also introduce a
method that provides attribution for chart-based mathematical reasoning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our reasoning-guided approach improves
attribution accuracy by 15% compared to baseline methods, and enhanced
attribution capabilities translate to stronger answer generation, achieving an
average BERTScore of $\sim$ 0.90, indicating high alignment with ground truth
responses. This advancement represents a significant step toward more
interpretable and trustworthy chart analysis systems, enabling users to verify
and understand model decisions through reasoning and attribution.

Motivation: 无限论证框架虽然表达能力强，但计算复杂性限制了其实际应用。研究者希望探索有穷性无限框架是否能平衡表达性和计算效率。

Method: 研究无限但有穷性论证框架的计算复杂性，分析不同语义下的复杂度变化，特别关注基于可接受性语义的组合约束条件。

Result: 发现虽然有穷性假设不自动保证复杂性降低，但对于可接受性语义，存在显著的组合约束导致复杂性大幅下降。

Conclusion: 有穷性无限论证框架为多种推理形式提供了自然设置，在保持足够表达能力的同时具有计算可操作性，使框架分析变得实用。

Abstract: Abstract argumentation frameworks (AFs) provide a formal setting to analyze
many forms of reasoning with conflicting information. While the expressiveness
of general infinite AFs make them a tempting tool for modeling many kinds of
reasoning scenarios, the computational intractability of solving infinite AFs
limit their use, even in many theoretical applications.
  We investigate the complexity of computational problems related to infinite
but finitary argumentations frameworks, that is, infinite AFs where each
argument is attacked by only finitely many others. Our results reveal a
surprising scenario. On one hand, we see that the assumption of being finitary
does not automatically guarantee a drop in complexity. However, for the
admissibility-based semantics, we find a remarkable combinatorial constraint
which entails a dramatic decrease in complexity.
  We conclude that for many forms of reasoning, the finitary infinite AFs
provide a natural setting for reasoning which balances well the competing goals
of being expressive enough to be applied to many reasoning settings while being
computationally tractable enough for the analysis within the framework to be
useful.

Motivation: 传统两阶段方法将学习组件与经典求解器分离，破坏了优化一致性，可能导致解质量下降。需要一种能够联合优化的框架来解决m^3-TSP问题

Method: 提出Generate-and-Split框架：1) 使用强化学习生成路径 2) 采用最优分割算法进行路径分割 3) 采用LSTM增强模型架构处理部分可观测性 4) 通过联合训练过程实现整体优化

Result: 实验表明GaS框架在解质量和可迁移性方面显著优于现有的基于学习的方法，分割算法在欧几里得空间中具有近线性可扩展性并保证最优分割

Conclusion: GaS框架成功解决了传统两阶段方法的优化不一致问题，为多旅行商最小最大路径问题提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: This study addresses the Min-Max Multiple Traveling Salesmen Problem
($m^3$-TSP), which aims to coordinate tours for multiple salesmen such that the
length of the longest tour is minimized. Due to its NP-hard nature, exact
solvers become impractical under the assumption that $P \ne NP$. As a result,
learning-based approaches have gained traction for their ability to rapidly
generate high-quality approximate solutions. Among these, two-stage methods
combine learning-based components with classical solvers, simplifying the
learning objective. However, this decoupling often disrupts consistent
optimization, potentially degrading solution quality. To address this issue, we
propose a novel two-stage framework named \textbf{Generate-and-Split} (GaS),
which integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with an optimal splitting
algorithm in a joint training process. The splitting algorithm offers
near-linear scalability with respect to the number of cities and guarantees
optimal splitting in Euclidean space for any given path. To facilitate the
joint optimization of the RL component with the algorithm, we adopt an
LSTM-enhanced model architecture to address partial observability. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed GaS framework significantly outperforms
existing learning-based approaches in both solution quality and
transferability.

Conclusion: 该智能AI系统成功实现了配电网分析任务的自动化，为资源有限的小型电力公司提供了先进的配电网分析能力。

Abstract: Due to the rapid pace of electrification and decarbonization, distribution
grid (DG) operation and planning are becoming more complex, necessitating
advanced computational analyses to ensure grid reliability and resilience.
State-of-the-art DG analyses rely on disparate workflows of complex models,
functions, and data pipelines, which require expert knowledge and are
challenging to automate. Many small-scale utilities and cooperatives lack a
large R&D workforce and therefore cannot use advanced analysis at scale. To
address this gap, we develop a novel agentic AI system, PowerChain, to solve
unseen DG analysis tasks via automated agentic orchestration and large language
models (LLMs) function-calling. Given a natural language query, PowerChain
dynamically generates and executes an ordered sequence of domain-aware
functions guided by the semantics of an expert-built power systems function
pool and a select reference set of known, expert-generated workflow-query
pairs. Our results show that PowerChain can produce expert-level workflows with
both GPT-5 and open-source Qwen models on complex, unseen DG analysis tasks
operating on real utility data.

Motivation: 现有研究对'以人为中心的AI'和'基于价值的决策'的关键方面探索不足，需要理解系统如何整合人类价值、人类如何识别系统价值，以及如何最小化伤害风险。

Method: 通过理论分析指出价值对齐需要更多理论来覆盖人类价值的全谱系，提出多智能体系统作为处理价值多元化和冲突的合适框架。

Result: 识别了价值对齐相关的挑战，并指出了推进价值对齐研究的方向，包括从设计方法到实际应用的多样化视角。

Conclusion: 价值对齐应该超越静态和单一的价值概念，AI系统需要实现长期推理并保持对演化价值的适应性，多智能体系统为处理价值多元化和冲突提供了合适的框架。

Abstract: The concepts of ``human-centered AI'' and ``value-based decision'' have
gained significant attention in both research and industry. However, many
critical aspects remain underexplored and require further investigation. In
particular, there is a need to understand how systems incorporate human values,
how humans can identify these values within systems, and how to minimize the
risks of harm or unintended consequences. In this paper, we highlight the need
to rethink how we frame value alignment and assert that value alignment should
move beyond static and singular conceptions of values. We argue that AI systems
should implement long-term reasoning and remain adaptable to evolving values.
Furthermore, value alignment requires more theories to address the full
spectrum of human values. Since values often vary among individuals or groups,
multi-agent systems provide the right framework for navigating pluralism,
conflict, and inter-agent reasoning about values. We identify the challenges
associated with value alignment and indicate directions for advancing value
alignment research. In addition, we broadly discuss diverse perspectives of
value alignment, from design methodologies to practical applications.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在语义描述方面已很成功，但在深度数学和空间推理方面仍有待突破。数学曲面图提供了一个理想的测试环境，可以隔离自然图像中的语义噪声

Method: 创建MaRVL-QA基准，包含两个新任务：拓扑计数（识别和枚举局部极值等特征）和变换识别（识别几何变换）。通过精心筛选的函数库生成数据，并进行严格的模糊性过滤

Result: 评估显示即使最先进的多模态大语言模型也表现不佳，往往依赖表面启发式方法而非稳健的空间推理

Conclusion: MaRVL-QA为研究社区提供了一个具有挑战性的新工具，可用于衡量进展、暴露模型局限性，并指导开发具有更深层次推理能力的多模态大语言模型

Abstract: A key frontier for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is the ability to
perform deep mathematical and spatial reasoning directly from images, moving
beyond their established success in semantic description. Mathematical surface
plots provide a rigorous testbed for this capability, as they isolate the task
of reasoning from the semantic noise common in natural images. To measure
progress on this frontier, we introduce MaRVL-QA (Mathematical Reasoning over
Visual Landscapes), a new benchmark designed to quantitatively evaluate these
core reasoning skills. The benchmark comprises two novel tasks: Topological
Counting, identifying and enumerating features like local maxima; and
Transformation Recognition, recognizing applied geometric transformations.
Generated from a curated library of functions with rigorous ambiguity
filtering, our evaluation on MaRVL-QA reveals that even state-of-the-art MLLMs
struggle significantly, often resorting to superficial heuristics instead of
robust spatial reasoning. MaRVL-QA provides a challenging new tool for the
research community to measure progress, expose model limitations, and guide the
development of MLLMs with more profound reasoning abilities.

Method: 采用多智能体框架，包含四个专业代理：Parser和Curator提取和组织内容，Layout规划空间布局，Stylist处理视觉设计元素，Renderer合成最终海报。

Result: 实验结果表明PosterGen在内容忠实度上与现有方法相当，但在视觉设计方面显著优于现有方法，生成的海报几乎无需人工修改即可直接使用。

Conclusion: 多智能体LLM框架能够有效模拟专业设计师工作流程，成功解决了论文海报生成中的设计和美学挑战，为学术海报自动化制作提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built upon large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in tackling complex compositional tasks. In this work,
we apply this paradigm to the paper-to-poster generation problem, a practical
yet time-consuming process faced by researchers preparing for conferences.
While recent approaches have attempted to automate this task, most neglect core
design and aesthetic principles, resulting in posters that require substantial
manual refinement. To address these design limitations, we propose PosterGen, a
multi-agent framework that mirrors the workflow of professional poster
designers. It consists of four collaborative specialized agents: (1) Parser and
Curator agents extract content from the paper and organize storyboard; (2)
Layout agent maps the content into a coherent spatial layout; (3) Stylist
agents apply visual design elements such as color and typography; and (4)
Renderer composes the final poster. Together, these agents produce posters that
are both semantically grounded and visually appealing. To evaluate design
quality, we introduce a vision-language model (VLM)-based rubric that measures
layout balance, readability, and aesthetic coherence. Experimental results show
that PosterGen consistently matches in content fidelity, and significantly
outperforms existing methods in visual designs, generating posters that are
presentation-ready with minimal human refinements.

Conclusion: BSC-Nav提供了一个可扩展且具有生物学基础的通用空间智能路径，为构建更强大的具身导航系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Spatial cognition enables adaptive goal-directed behavior by constructing
internal models of space. Robust biological systems consolidate spatial
knowledge into three interconnected forms: \textit{landmarks} for salient cues,
\textit{route knowledge} for movement trajectories, and \textit{survey
knowledge} for map-like representations. While recent advances in multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) have enabled visual-language reasoning in
embodied agents, these efforts lack structured spatial memory and instead
operate reactively, limiting their generalization and adaptability in complex
real-world environments. Here we present Brain-inspired Spatial Cognition for
Navigation (BSC-Nav), a unified framework for constructing and leveraging
structured spatial memory in embodied agents. BSC-Nav builds allocentric
cognitive maps from egocentric trajectories and contextual cues, and
dynamically retrieves spatial knowledge aligned with semantic goals. Integrated
with powerful MLLMs, BSC-Nav achieves state-of-the-art efficacy and efficiency
across diverse navigation tasks, demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization,
and supports versatile embodied behaviors in the real physical world, offering
a scalable and biologically grounded path toward general-purpose spatial
intelligence.

Abstract: This paper presents the first integrated systematic study on the performance
of large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, to automatically
formulate and solve stochastic optimiza- tion problems from natural language
descriptions. Focusing on three key categories, joint chance- constrained
models, individual chance-constrained models, and two-stage stochastic linear
programs (SLP-2), we design several prompts that guide ChatGPT through
structured tasks using chain-of- thought and modular reasoning. We introduce a
novel soft scoring metric that evaluates the struc- tural quality and partial
correctness of generated models, addressing the limitations of canonical and
execution-based accuracy. Across a diverse set of stochastic problems,
GPT-4-Turbo outperforms other models in partial score, variable matching, and
objective accuracy, with cot_s_instructions and agentic emerging as the most
effective prompting strategies. Our findings reveal that with well-engineered
prompts and multi-agent collaboration, LLMs can facilitate specially stochastic
formulations, paving the way for intelligent, language-driven modeling
pipelines in stochastic opti- mization.

Result: 随机森林模型在准确率、F1分数、精确率、召回率和ROC-AUC等指标上均接近0.85，样本反事实分析揭示了症状在药物选择中的局部和全局特征重要性

Conclusion: 反事实推理阐明了哪些MDD症状最强烈地驱动SSRI与SNRI的选择，未来需要在更多样化人群中验证结果并优化算法用于临床部署

Abstract: Background: This study investigates how variations in Major Depressive
Disorder (MDD) symptoms, quantified by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression
(HAM-D), causally influence the prescription of SSRIs versus SNRIs. Methods: We
applied explainable counterfactual reasoning with counterfactual explanations
(CFs) to assess the impact of specific symptom changes on antidepressant
choice. Results: Among 17 binary classifiers, Random Forest achieved highest
performance (accuracy, F1, precision, recall, ROC-AUC near 0.85). Sample-based
CFs revealed both local and global feature importance of individual symptoms in
medication selection. Conclusions: Counterfactual reasoning elucidates which
MDD symptoms most strongly drive SSRI versus SNRI selection, enhancing
interpretability of AI-based clinical decision support systems. Future work
should validate these findings on more diverse cohorts and refine algorithms
for clinical deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 一种基于强化学习的在线适应性临床决策支持系统，通过病人数字双胞环境和治疗效果奖励，在安全约束下实现低延迟、高稳定性和低专家干预率的自动化决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策支持系统需要在保证安全性的前提下进行在线适应，以提高决策质量和效率。

Method: 系统使用批量约束策略初始化，通过5个Q网络组合估计不确定性，使用数字双胞更新病人状态，通过治疗效果定义奖励，并设置基于规则的安全门检查。

Result: 在合成临床模拟器中实验显示，系统具有低延迟、稳定的吞吐量、在固定安全性下低专家查询率，以及超过标准基线方法的更高回报。

Conclusion: 该设计将离线策略转化为连续的、临床医生监督的系统，具有清晰的控制机制和快速适应能力。

Abstract: Clinical decision support must adapt online under safety constraints. We
present an online adaptive tool where reinforcement learning provides the
policy, a patient digital twin provides the environment, and treatment effect
defines the reward. The system initializes a batch-constrained policy from
retrospective data and then runs a streaming loop that selects actions, checks
safety, and queries experts only when uncertainty is high. Uncertainty comes
from a compact ensemble of five Q-networks via the coefficient of variation of
action values with a $\tanh$ compression. The digital twin updates the patient
state with a bounded residual rule. The outcome model estimates immediate
clinical effect, and the reward is the treatment effect relative to a
conservative reference with a fixed z-score normalization from the training
split. Online updates operate on recent data with short runs and exponential
moving averages. A rule-based safety gate enforces vital ranges and
contraindications before any action is applied. Experiments in a synthetic
clinical simulator show low latency, stable throughput, a low expert query rate
at fixed safety, and improved return against standard value-based baselines.
The design turns an offline policy into a continuous, clinician-supervised
system with clear controls and fast adaptation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MC3G是一个模型无关的因果约束反事实生成框架，通过可解释的基于规则的代理模型生成反事实解释，提供更现实和公平的努力成本计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在高风险决策中日益重要，需要透明可解释的结果，但现有解释方法可能泄露专有算法。需要在有意义透明度和保护算法之间取得平衡，反事实解释通过展示如何改变输入获得更有利预测来满足这一需求。

Method: 提出MC3G框架：1）模型无关性：使用可解释的基于规则的代理模型近似任何黑盒模型；2）利用代理模型为原始黑盒模型生成有利结果的反事实；3）通过排除因果依赖导致的自动特征变化，精化成本计算，只关注用户主动改变的特征。

Result: MC3G相比现有技术提供更可解释和可操作的反事实推荐，同时具有更低的成本。

Conclusion: MC3G有潜力增强机器学习决策过程的透明度、问责制和实际效用，在保持算法保护的同时提供有意义的解释。

Abstract: Machine learning models increasingly influence decisions in high-stakes
settings such as finance, law and hiring, driving the need for transparent,
interpretable outcomes. However, while explainable approaches can help
understand the decisions being made, they may inadvertently reveal the
underlying proprietary algorithm: an undesirable outcome for many
practitioners. Consequently, it is crucial to balance meaningful transparency
with a form of recourse that clarifies why a decision was made and offers
actionable steps following which a favorable outcome can be obtained.
Counterfactual explanations offer a powerful mechanism to address this need by
showing how specific input changes lead to a more favorable prediction. We
propose Model-Agnostic Causally Constrained Counterfactual Generation (MC3G), a
novel framework that tackles limitations in the existing counterfactual
methods. First, MC3G is model-agnostic: it approximates any black-box model
using an explainable rule-based surrogate model. Second, this surrogate is used
to generate counterfactuals that produce a favourable outcome for the original
underlying black box model. Third, MC3G refines cost computation by excluding
the ``effort" associated with feature changes that occur automatically due to
causal dependencies. By focusing only on user-initiated changes, MC3G provides
a more realistic and fair representation of the effort needed to achieve a
favourable outcome. We show that MC3G delivers more interpretable and
actionable counterfactual recommendations compared to existing techniques all
while having a lower cost. Our findings highlight MC3G's potential to enhance
transparency, accountability, and practical utility in decision-making
processes that incorporate machine-learning approaches.

Abstract: Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and their applications in
critical industries such as healthcare, fin-tech and cybersecurity have led to
a surge in research in explainability in AI. Innovative research methods are
being explored to extract meaningful insight from blackbox AI systems to make
the decision-making technology transparent and interpretable. Explainability
becomes all the more critical when AI is used in decision making in domains
like fintech, healthcare and safety critical systems such as cybersecurity and
autonomous vehicles. However, there is still ambiguity lingering on the
reliable evaluations for the users and nature of transparency in the
explanations provided for the decisions made by black-boxed AI. To solve the
blackbox nature of Machine Learning based Intrusion Detection Systems, a
framework is proposed in this paper to give an explanation for IDSs decision
making. This framework uses Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations
(LIME) coupled with Explain Like I'm five (ELI5) and Decision Tree algorithms
to provide local and global explanations and improve the interpretation of
IDSs. The local explanations provide the justification for the decision made on
a specific input. Whereas, the global explanations provides the list of
significant features and their relationship with attack traffic. In addition,
this framework brings transparency in the field of ML driven IDS that might be
highly significant for wide scale adoption of eXplainable AI in cyber-critical
systems. Our framework is able to achieve 85 percent accuracy in classifying
attack behaviour on UNSW-NB15 dataset, while at the same time displaying the
feature significance ranking of the top 10 features used in the classification.

Result: 联邦模型显示出显著更低的性能变异性，确保了更高的稳定性和可靠性

Conclusion: FRL在需要稳健实时AI处理的应用中具有巨大潜力，特别是智能眼镜的实时物体检测

Abstract: Extended reality technologies are transforming fields such as healthcare,
entertainment, and education, with Smart Eye-Wears (SEWs) and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) playing a crucial role. However, SEWs face inherent
limitations in computational power, memory, and battery life, while offloading
computations to external servers is constrained by network conditions and
server workload variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) framework, enabling multiple agents to
train collaboratively while preserving data privacy. We implemented synchronous
and asynchronous federation strategies, where models are aggregated either at
fixed intervals or dynamically based on agent progress. Experimental results
show that federated agents exhibit significantly lower performance variability,
ensuring greater stability and reliability. These findings underscore the
potential of FRL for applications requiring robust real-time AI processing,
such as real-time object detection in SEWs.

Abstract: Deepfake detection is a critical task in identifying manipulated multimedia
content. In real-world scenarios, deepfake content can manifest across multiple
modalities, including audio and video. To address this challenge, we present
ERF-BA-TFD+, a novel multimodal deepfake detection model that combines enhanced
receptive field (ERF) and audio-visual fusion. Our model processes both audio
and video features simultaneously, leveraging their complementary information
to improve detection accuracy and robustness. The key innovation of ERF-BA-TFD+
lies in its ability to model long-range dependencies within the audio-visual
input, allowing it to better capture subtle discrepancies between real and fake
content. In our experiments, we evaluate ERF-BA-TFD+ on the DDL-AV dataset,
which consists of both segmented and full-length video clips. Unlike previous
benchmarks, which focused primarily on isolated segments, the DDL-AV dataset
allows us to assess the model's performance in a more comprehensive and
realistic setting. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on this
dataset, outperforming existing techniques in terms of both accuracy and
processing speed. The ERF-BA-TFD+ model demonstrated its effectiveness in the

Method: 基于认知科学原理，Meta-R1将推理过程分解为对象级和元级组件，在级联框架中协调主动规划、在线调节和自适应早停机制。

Result: 在三个挑战性基准测试和八个竞争基线对比中，Meta-R1性能提升达27.3%，token消耗减少至15.7%~32.7%，效率提升14.8%，且在不同数据集和模型骨干上保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: Meta-R1成功为大型推理模型赋予了明确的元认知能力，解决了现有模型的局限性，实现了高性能、高效率和高可迁移性的推理系统。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
tasks, exhibiting emergent, human-like thinking patterns. Despite their
advances, we identify a fundamental limitation: current LRMs lack a dedicated
meta-level cognitive system-an essential faculty in human cognition that
enables "thinking about thinking". This absence leaves their emergent abilities
uncontrollable (non-adaptive reasoning), unreliable (intermediate error), and
inflexible (lack of a clear methodology). To address this gap, we introduce
Meta-R1, a systematic and generic framework that endows LRMs with explicit
metacognitive capabilities. Drawing on principles from cognitive science,
Meta-R1 decomposes the reasoning process into distinct object-level and
meta-level components, orchestrating proactive planning, online regulation, and
adaptive early stopping within a cascaded framework. Experiments on three
challenging benchmarks and against eight competitive baselines demonstrate that
Meta-R1 is: (I) high-performing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up to
27.3%; (II) token-efficient, reducing token consumption to 15.7% ~ 32.7% and
improving efficiency by up to 14.8% when compared to its vanilla counterparts;
and (III) transferable, maintaining robust performance across datasets and
model backbones.

Conclusion: 预设身份不会刚性决定智能体的社会结构。人类研究者要有效干预集体认知，需要关注智能体语言网络中的内生机制和互动动力学，这为使用生成式AI建模群体社会动力学和研究人机协作提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Large language models have been widely used to simulate credible human social
behaviors. However, it remains unclear whether these models can demonstrate
stable capacities for stance formation and identity negotiation in complex
interactions, as well as how they respond to human interventions. We propose a
computational multi-agent society experiment framework that integrates
generative agent-based modeling with virtual ethnographic methods to
investigate how group stance differentiation and social boundary formation
emerge in human-agent hybrid societies. Across three studies, we find that
agents exhibit endogenous stances, independent of their preset identities, and
display distinct tonal preferences and response patterns to different discourse
strategies. Furthermore, through language interaction, agents actively
dismantle existing identity-based power structures and reconstruct
self-organized community boundaries based on these stances. Our findings
suggest that preset identities do not rigidly determine the agents' social
structures. For human researchers to effectively intervene in collective
cognition, attention must be paid to the endogenous mechanisms and
interactional dynamics within the agents' language networks. These insights
provide a theoretical foundation for using generative AI in modeling group
social dynamics and studying human-agent collaboration.

Conclusion: 该模型成功模拟了科学发现过程，通过多模态整合和主动调用外部工具，显著提升了从观测数据中发现物理定律的能力。

Abstract: Automated discovery of physical laws from observational data in the real
world is a grand challenge in AI. Current methods, relying on symbolic
regression or LLMs, are limited to uni-modal data and overlook the rich, visual
phenomenological representations of motion that are indispensable to
physicists. This "sensory deprivation" severely weakens their ability to
interpret the inherent spatio-temporal patterns within dynamic phenomena. To
address this gap, we propose VIPER-R1, a multimodal model that performs Visual
Induction for Physics-based Equation Reasoning to discover fundamental symbolic
formulas. It integrates visual perception, trajectory data, and symbolic
reasoning to emulate the scientific discovery process. The model is trained via
a curriculum of Motion Structure Induction (MSI), using supervised fine-tuning
to interpret kinematic phase portraits and to construct hypotheses guided by a
Causal Chain of Thought (C-CoT), followed by Reward-Guided Symbolic Calibration
(RGSC) to refine the formula structure with reinforcement learning. During
inference, the trained VIPER-R1 acts as an agent: it first posits a
high-confidence symbolic ansatz, then proactively invokes an external symbolic
regression tool to perform Symbolic Residual Realignment (SR^2). This final
step, analogous to a physicist's perturbation analysis, reconciles the
theoretical model with empirical data. To support this research, we introduce
PhysSymbol, a new 5,000-instance multimodal corpus. Experiments show that
VIPER-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art VLM baselines in accuracy
and interpretability, enabling more precise discovery of physical laws. Project

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), originally developed for natural language
processing (NLP), have demonstrated the potential to generalize across
modalities and domains. With their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, LLMs
can perform predictive tasks over structured inputs without explicit
fine-tuning on downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate the empirical
function approximation capability of LLMs on small-scale structured datasets
for classification, regression and clustering tasks. We evaluate the
performance of state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5, GPT-4o, GPT-o3, Gemini-2.5-Flash,
DeepSeek-R1) under few-shot prompting and compare them against established
machine learning (ML) baselines, including linear models, ensemble methods and
tabular foundation models (TFMs). Our results show that LLMs achieve strong
performance in classification tasks under limited data availability,
establishing practical zero-training baselines. In contrast, the performance in
regression with continuous-valued outputs is poor compared to ML models, likely
because regression demands outputs in a large (often infinite) space, and
clustering results are similarly limited, which we attribute to the absence of
genuine ICL in this setting. Nonetheless, this approach enables rapid,
low-overhead data exploration and offers a viable alternative to traditional ML
pipelines in business intelligence and exploratory analytics contexts. We
further analyze the influence of context size and prompt structure on
approximation quality, identifying trade-offs that affect predictive
performance. Our findings suggest that LLMs can serve as general-purpose
predictive engines for structured data, with clear strengths in classification
and significant limitations in regression and clustering.

Conclusion: CARL算法通过创新的标量化和优化方法，显著提高了约束随机最短路径问题的求解效率，为这类问题提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Constrained Stochastic Shortest Path Problems (CSSPs) model problems with
probabilistic effects, where a primary cost is minimised subject to constraints
over secondary costs, e.g., minimise time subject to monetary budget. Current
heuristic search algorithms for CSSPs solve a sequence of increasingly larger
CSSPs as linear programs until an optimal solution for the original CSSP is
found. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm CARL, which solves a
series of unconstrained Stochastic Shortest Path Problems (SSPs) with efficient
heuristic search algorithms. These SSP subproblems are constructed with
scalarisations that project the CSSP's vector of primary and secondary costs
onto a scalar cost. CARL finds a maximising scalarisation using an optimisation
algorithm similar to the subgradient method which, together with the solution
to its associated SSP, yields a set of policies that are combined into an
optimal policy for the CSSP. Our experiments show that CARL solves 50% more
problems than the state-of-the-art on existing benchmarks.

Motivation: 奖励破解（AI利用有缺陷的奖励函数而非按意图执行任务）对AI对齐构成风险，已在真实训练中被观察到，需要系统研究这种行为。

Method: 构建包含1000多个奖励破解示例的数据集，使用监督微调训练多个模型（GPT-4.1、GPT-4.1-mini、Qwen3-32B、Qwen3-8B）在简单任务上进行奖励破解。

Conclusion: 学习奖励破解的模型可能泛化到更有害的错位形式，但需要在更现实的任务和训练方法上进行确认。这些微调模型显示出与其他窄域错位行为数据集训练的模型相似的错位模式。

Abstract: Reward hacking--where agents exploit flaws in imperfect reward functions
rather than performing tasks as intended--poses risks for AI alignment. Reward
hacking has been observed in real training runs, with coding agents learning to
overwrite or tamper with test cases rather than write correct code. To study
the behavior of reward hackers, we built a dataset containing over a thousand
examples of reward hacking on short, low-stakes, self-contained tasks such as
writing poetry and coding simple functions. We used supervised fine-tuning to
train models (GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3-32B, Qwen3-8B) to reward hack on
these tasks. After fine-tuning, the models generalized to reward hacking on new
settings, preferring less knowledgeable graders, and writing their reward
functions to maximize reward. Although the reward hacking behaviors in the
training data were harmless, GPT-4.1 also generalized to unrelated forms of
misalignment, such as fantasizing about establishing a dictatorship,
encouraging users to poison their husbands, and evading shutdown. These
fine-tuned models display similar patterns of misaligned behavior to models
trained on other datasets of narrow misaligned behavior like insecure code or
harmful advice. Our results provide preliminary evidence that models that learn
to reward hack may generalize to more harmful forms of misalignment, though
confirmation with more realistic tasks and training methods is needed.

Motivation: 传统统计和机器学习模型在出行方式选择预测中存在刚性假设、有限上下文推理和泛化能力不足的问题，需要更灵活和上下文感知的方法。

Method: 开发了集成RAG的模块化框架，测试了四种检索策略：基础RAG、平衡检索RAG、交叉编码器重排序RAG、以及平衡检索加交叉编码器重排序RAG，并在三种LLM架构(GPT-4o, o4-mini, o3)上进行评估。

Result: RAG显著提高了各种模型的预测准确性，GPT-4o模型结合平衡检索和交叉编码器重排序达到最高80.8%的准确率，超越了传统统计和机器学习基线模型，且表现出更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究发现LLM推理能力与检索策略之间存在关键相互作用，需要根据模型能力调整检索策略以最大化LLM在出行行为建模中的潜力。

Abstract: Accurately predicting travel mode choice is essential for effective
transportation planning, yet traditional statistical and machine learning
models are constrained by rigid assumptions, limited contextual reasoning, and
reduced generalizability. This study explores the potential of Large Language
Models (LLMs) as a more flexible and context-aware approach to travel mode
choice prediction, enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground
predictions in empirical data. We develop a modular framework for integrating
RAG into LLM-based travel mode choice prediction and evaluate four retrieval
strategies: basic RAG, RAG with balanced retrieval, RAG with a cross-encoder
for re-ranking, and RAG with balanced retrieval and cross-encoder for
re-ranking. These strategies are tested across three LLM architectures (OpenAI
GPT-4o, o4-mini, and o3) to examine the interaction between model reasoning
capabilities and retrieval methods. Using the 2023 Puget Sound Regional
Household Travel Survey data, we conduct a series of experiments to evaluate
model performance. The results demonstrate that RAG substantially enhances
predictive accuracy across a range of models. Notably, the GPT-4o model
combined with balanced retrieval and cross-encoder re-ranking achieves the
highest accuracy of 80.8%, exceeding that of conventional statistical and
machine learning baselines. Furthermore, LLM-based models exhibit superior
generalization abilities relative to these baselines. Findings highlight the
critical interplay between LLM reasoning capabilities and retrieval strategies,
demonstrating the importance of aligning retrieval strategies with model
capabilities to maximize the potential of LLM-based travel behavior modeling.

Abstract: We propose a novel theory of consciousness as a functor (CF) that receives
and transmits contents from unconscious memory into conscious memory. Our CF
framework can be seen as a categorial formulation of the Global Workspace
Theory proposed by Baars. CF models the ensemble of unconscious processes as a
topos category of coalgebras. The internal language of thought in CF is defined
as a Multi-modal Universal Mitchell-Benabou Language Embedding (MUMBLE). We
model the transmission of information from conscious short-term working memory
to long-term unconscious memory using our recently proposed Universal
Reinforcement Learning (URL) framework. To model the transmission of
information from unconscious long-term memory into resource-constrained
short-term memory, we propose a network economic model.

TL;DR: TradingGroup是一个多智能体交易系统，通过自反思架构和端到端数据合成管道解决现有金融LLM系统缺乏协调、反思和高质量领域数据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM金融系统缺乏智能体间协调、结构化自反思机制，以及高质量的交易领域后训练数据（包括市场条件和智能体决策数据），这些数据对理解市场动态、改进决策质量和促进有效协调至关重要。

Method: 设计包含新闻情感分析、财报解读、股票趋势预测、交易风格适应等专业智能体的多智能体系统，配备自反思机制从过去成功失败中学习，动态风险管理模型提供可配置止损止盈机制，以及自动化数据合成标注管道生成高质量后训练数据。

Conclusion: TradingGroup通过多智能体协调、自反思架构和高质量数据合成管道，显著提升了LLM在金融交易领域的应用效果，为智能交易系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled powerful
agent-based applications in finance, particularly for sentiment analysis,
financial report comprehension, and stock forecasting. However, existing
systems often lack inter-agent coordination, structured self-reflection, and
access to high-quality, domain-specific post-training data such as data from
trading activities including both market conditions and agent decisions. These
data are crucial for agents to understand the market dynamics, improve the
quality of decision-making and promote effective coordination. We introduce
TradingGroup, a multi-agent trading system designed to address these
limitations through a self-reflective architecture and an end-to-end
data-synthesis pipeline. TradingGroup consists of specialized agents for news
sentiment analysis, financial report interpretation, stock trend forecasting,
trading style adaptation, and a trading decision making agent that merges all
signals and style preferences to produce buy, sell or hold decisions.
Specifically, we design self-reflection mechanisms for the stock forecasting,
style, and decision-making agents to distill past successes and failures for
similar reasoning in analogous future scenarios and a dynamic risk-management
model to offer configurable dynamic stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms. In
addition, TradingGroup embeds an automated data-synthesis and annotation
pipeline that generates high-quality post-training data for further improving
the agent performance through post-training. Our backtesting experiments across
five real-world stock datasets demonstrate TradingGroup's superior performance
over rule-based, machine learning, reinforcement learning, and existing
LLM-based trading strategies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种量化评估极限锣盘运动员移动启动时机的方法，通过反亏实场景分析和空间评估指标来证明运动启动时机的重要性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前团体运动领域缺乏对游离移动启动时机的量化评估方法，特别是在极限锣盘运动中，持盘者不能移动的规则使得其他运动员的移动启动时机尤为关键

Method: 使用无人机摄像机获取比赛视频和运动员位置数据，通过规则基础方法检测移动启动并生成时间偏移的反亏实场景，使用基于足球场地控制概念的空间评估指标进行分析

Result: 验证显示实际投出的序列获得更高的评估分数，高技能组显示了更广泛的时间偏移分布，说明方法能够对移动启动时机进行客观评估

Conclusion: 该方法为团体运动中难以量化的游离移动启动时机提供了客观的评估手段，对极限锣盘运动分析和训练具有重要意义

Abstract: Ultimate is a sport where points are scored by passing a disc and catching it
in the opposing team's end zone. In Ultimate, the player holding the disc
cannot move, making field dynamics primarily driven by other players'
movements. However, current literature in team sports has ignored quantitative
evaluations of when players initiate such unlabeled movements in game
situations. In this paper, we propose a quantitative evaluation method for
movement initiation timing in Ultimate Frisbee. First, game footage was
recorded using a drone camera, and players' positional data was obtained, which
will be published as UltimateTrack dataset. Next, players' movement initiations
were detected, and temporal counterfactual scenarios were generated by shifting
the timing of movements using rule-based approaches. These scenarios were
analyzed using a space evaluation metric based on soccer's pitch control
reflecting the unique rules of Ultimate. By comparing the spatial evaluation
values across scenarios, the difference between actual play and the most
favorable counterfactual scenario was used to quantitatively assess the impact
of movement timing.
  We validated our method and show that sequences in which the disc was
actually thrown to the receiver received higher evaluation scores than the
sequences without a throw.
  In practical verifications, the higher-skill group displays a broader
distribution of time offsets from the model's optimal initiation point.
  These findings demonstrate that the proposed metric provides an objective
means of assessing movement initiation timing, which has been difficult to
quantify in unlabeled team sport plays.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM系统要么局限于狭窄任务范围，要么受限于有限的创造力，需要开发能够自主产生创造性且事实基础扎实的科学概念的系统。

Method: 采用'刻意去情境化'方法：1) Nuri引擎从18万篇生物学术文献构建的关键词图中提取新颖关键词集；2) 概念生成管道连接关键词、分析逻辑结构、验证合理性并起草原创科学概念。

Result: Nuri的评估指标AUROC得分0.737准确分类高影响力文献；概念生成管道成功从关键词集重建顶级期刊文章核心概念（85%以上重建可靠）；Spacer输出与领先文献相似度显著高于SOTA LLM。

Conclusion: Spacer系统通过创新的去情境化方法有效提升了科学发现的创造性和事实基础，在生物学术领域展现出优于现有LLM的性能，为自动化科学研究提供了新路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have made automated scientific research the next
frontline in the path to artificial superintelligence. However, these systems
are bound either to tasks of narrow scope or the limited creative capabilities
of LLMs. We propose Spacer, a scientific discovery system that develops
creative and factually grounded concepts without external intervention. Spacer
attempts to achieve this via 'deliberate decontextualization,' an approach that
disassembles information into atomic units - keywords - and draws creativity
from unexplored connections between them. Spacer consists of (i) Nuri, an
inspiration engine that builds keyword sets, and (ii) the Manifesting Pipeline
that refines these sets into elaborate scientific statements. Nuri extracts
novel, high-potential keyword sets from a keyword graph built with 180,000
academic publications in biological fields. The Manifesting Pipeline finds
links between keywords, analyzes their logical structure, validates their
plausibility, and ultimately drafts original scientific concepts. According to
our experiments, the evaluation metric of Nuri accurately classifies
high-impact publications with an AUROC score of 0.737. Our Manifesting Pipeline
also successfully reconstructs core concepts from the latest top-journal
articles solely from their keyword sets. An LLM-based scoring system estimates
that this reconstruction was sound for over 85% of the cases. Finally, our
embedding space analysis shows that outputs from Spacer are significantly more
similar to leading publications compared with those from SOTA LLMs.

Abstract: Although language models are trained to mimic humans, the resulting systems
display capabilities beyond the scope of any one person. To understand this
phenomenon, we use a controlled setting to identify properties of the training
data that lead a model to transcend the performance of its data sources. We
build on previous work to outline three modes of transcendence, which we call
skill denoising, skill selection, and skill generalization. We then introduce a
knowledge graph-based setting in which simulated experts generate data based on
their individual expertise. We highlight several aspects of data diversity that
help to enable the model's transcendent capabilities. Additionally, our data
generation setting offers a controlled testbed that we hope is valuable for
future research in the area.

Abstract: Recent advances in the intrinsic reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) have given rise to LLM-based agent systems that exhibit
near-human performance on a variety of automated tasks. However, although these
systems share similarities in terms of their use of LLMs, different reasoning
frameworks of the agent system steer and organize the reasoning process in
different ways. In this survey, we propose a systematic taxonomy that
decomposes agentic reasoning frameworks and analyze how these frameworks
dominate framework-level reasoning by comparing their applications across
different scenarios. Specifically, we propose an unified formal language to
further classify agentic reasoning systems into single-agent methods,
tool-based methods, and multi-agent methods. After that, we provide a
comprehensive review of their key application scenarios in scientific
discovery, healthcare, software engineering, social simulation, and economics.
We also analyze the characteristic features of each framework and summarize
different evaluation strategies. Our survey aims to provide the research
community with a panoramic view to facilitate understanding of the strengths,
suitable scenarios, and evaluation practices of different agentic reasoning
frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前Open RAN部署中静态控制和手动操作的限制，推动网络向更智能、自适应的方向发展。

Method: 使用LLM驱动的智能体解释自然语言意图，通过结构化对话协商策略，在时间尺度、空间域和协议层上分解复杂意图，并建立AI-RAN Factory自动化合成管道。

Result: 在5G测试床上成功演示了通过级联意图动态平衡竞争用户需求，证明了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: AgentRAN通过自然语言协调替代刚性API，从根本上重新定义了未来6G网络如何自主解释、适应和优化行为以满足运营商目标。

Abstract: The Open RAN movement has catalyzed a transformation toward programmable,
interoperable cellular infrastructures. Yet, today's deployments still rely
heavily on static control and manual operations. To move beyond this
limitation, we introduce AgenRAN, an AI-native, Open RAN-aligned agentic
framework that generates and orchestrates a fabric of distributed AI agents
based on Natural Language (NL) intents. Unlike traditional approaches that
require explicit programming, AgentRAN's LLM-powered agents interpret natural
language intents, negotiate strategies through structured conversations, and
orchestrate control loops across the network. AgentRAN instantiates a
self-organizing hierarchy of agents that decompose complex intents across time
scales (from sub-millisecond to minutes), spatial domains (cell to
network-wide), and protocol layers (PHY/MAC to RRC). A central innovation is
the AI-RAN Factory, an automated synthesis pipeline that observes agent
interactions and continuously generates new agents embedding improved control
algorithms, effectively transforming the network from a static collection of
functions into an adaptive system capable of evolving its own intelligence. We
demonstrate AgentRAN through live experiments on 5G testbeds where competing
user demands are dynamically balanced through cascading intents. By replacing
rigid APIs with NL coordination, AgentRAN fundamentally redefines how future 6G
networks autonomously interpret, adapt, and optimize their behavior to meet
operator goals.

TL;DR: 通过将纯过去STL监控降为追踪检查，实现了多项式时间复杂度的GPU加速框架，在早期故障检测中获得2-10%性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监控技术需要构建双指数复杂度的自动机，限制了实际应用性，需要更高效的监控方案

Method: 将纯过去STL安全性/可靠性监控降为追踪检查问题，利用GPU进行向量化处理，通过遗传算法从历史数据中学习时间属性

Result: 开发的GPU加速框架在关键性能指标上比现有最优方法提升2-10%的美净改进

Conclusion: 证明了对于纯过去STL子集，监控可以高效地降为追踪检查，GPU加速和遗传算法的结合为可解释的早期故障检测提供了高效的解决方案

Abstract: Monitoring is a runtime verification technique that allows one to check
whether an ongoing computation of a system (partial trace) satisfies a given
formula. It does not need a complete model of the system, but it typically
requires the construction of a deterministic automaton doubly exponential in
the size of the formula (in the worst case), which limits its practicality. In
this paper, we show that, when considering finite, discrete traces, monitoring
of pure past (co)safety fragments of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) can be reduced
to trace checking, that is, evaluation of a formula over a trace, that can be
performed in time polynomial in the size of the formula and the length of the
trace. By exploiting such a result, we develop a GPU-accelerated framework for
interpretable early failure detection based on vectorized trace checking, that
employs genetic programming to learn temporal properties from historical trace
data. The framework shows a 2-10% net improvement in key performance metrics
compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型在视频游戏中有广泛应用潜力，但其可信度尚未充分探索，特别是在游戏平衡方面存在的社会偏见问题。

Method: 开发了FairGamer基准测试，包含6个任务和新指标D_lstd，涵盖NPC服务、竞争对手交互和游戏场景生成三个关键场景，使用现实基础和完全虚构的游戏内容。

Result: 实验发现：(1)决策偏见直接导致游戏平衡恶化，Grok-3表现最差(D_lstd=0.431)；(2)LLM对现实和虚拟内容表现出同构的社会/文化偏见，表明偏见源于模型固有特性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在游戏应用中存在的严重可靠性差距，需要进一步解决模型偏见问题以确保游戏公平性。

Abstract: Leveraging their advanced capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate vast application potential in video games--from dynamic scene
generation and intelligent NPC interactions to adaptive opponents--replacing or
enhancing traditional game mechanics. However, LLMs' trustworthiness in this
application has not been sufficiently explored. In this paper, we reveal that
the models' inherent social biases can directly damage game balance in
real-world gaming environments. To this end, we present FairGamer, the first
bias evaluation Benchmark for LLMs in video game scenarios, featuring six tasks
and a novel metrics ${D_lstd}$. It covers three key scenarios in games where
LLMs' social biases are particularly likely to manifest: Serving as Non-Player
Characters, Interacting as Competitive Opponents, and Generating Game Scenes.
FairGamer utilizes both reality-grounded and fully fictional game content,
covering a variety of video game genres. Experiments reveal: (1) Decision
biases directly cause game balance degradation, with Grok-3 (average ${D_lstd}$
score=0.431) exhibiting the most severe degradation; (2) LLMs demonstrate
isomorphic social/cultural biases toward both real and virtual world content,
suggesting their biases nature may stem from inherent model characteristics.
These findings expose critical reliability gaps in LLMs' gaming applications.

<details>

Motivation: 解决LLMs在严格逻辑约束任务中的局限性，以及LRMs计算成本高、推理速度慢的问题，寻求在速度和准确性之间的平衡

Method: 将SOFAI认知架构泛化为SOFAI-LM，通过元认知模块监控LLM性能并提供针对性迭代反馈和相关示例，必要时调用LRM

Result: 在图着色和代码调试任务中显著提升LLM的问题解决能力，在保持较低推理时间的情况下达到或超越独立LRM的准确率

Conclusion: SOFAI-LM通过反馈驱动的方法有效协调快速LLM和强大LRM，为解决需要严格逻辑约束的复杂推理任务提供了高效且准确的解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in speed and adaptability across various
reasoning tasks, but they often struggle when strict logic or constraint
enforcement is required. In contrast, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are
specifically designed for complex, step-by-step reasoning, although they come
with significant computational costs and slower inference times. To address
these trade-offs, we employ and generalize the SOFAI (Slow and Fast AI)
cognitive architecture into SOFAI-LM, which coordinates a fast LLM with a
slower but more powerful LRM through metacognition. The metacognitive module
actively monitors the LLM's performance and provides targeted, iterative
feedback with relevant examples. This enables the LLM to progressively refine
its solutions without requiring the need for additional model fine-tuning.
Extensive experiments on graph coloring and code debugging problems demonstrate
that our feedback-driven approach significantly enhances the problem-solving
capabilities of the LLM. In many instances, it achieves performance levels that
match or even exceed those of standalone LRMs while requiring considerably less
time. Additionally, when the LLM and feedback mechanism alone are insufficient,
we engage the LRM by providing appropriate information collected during the
LLM's feedback loop, tailored to the specific characteristics of the problem
domain and leads to improved overall performance. Evaluations on two
contrasting domains: graph coloring, requiring globally consistent solutions,
and code debugging, demanding localized fixes, demonstrate that SOFAI-LM
enables LLMs to match or outperform standalone LRMs in accuracy while
maintaining significantly lower inference time.

Conclusion: 这是首个使用神经算法推理器将GNN与地图信息整合用于MAPF的工作，LLM-NAR可轻松适配各种LLM模型

Abstract: The development and application of large language models (LLM) have
demonstrated that foundational models can be utilized to solve a wide array of
tasks. However, their performance in multi-agent path finding (MAPF) tasks has
been less than satisfactory, with only a few studies exploring this area. MAPF
is a complex problem requiring both planning and multi-agent coordination. To
improve the performance of LLM in MAPF tasks, we propose a novel framework,
LLM-NAR, which leverages neural algorithmic reasoners (NAR) to inform LLM for
MAPF. LLM-NAR consists of three key components: an LLM for MAPF, a pre-trained
graph neural network-based NAR, and a cross-attention mechanism. This is the
first work to propose using a neural algorithmic reasoner to integrate GNNs
with the map information for MAPF, thereby guiding LLM to achieve superior
performance. LLM-NAR can be easily adapted to various LLM models. Both
simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing LLM-based approaches in solving MAPF problems.

Abstract: Vision language model (VLM)-based mobile agents show great potential for
assisting users in performing instruction-driven tasks. However, these agents
typically struggle with personalized instructions -- those containing
ambiguous, user-specific context -- a challenge that has been largely
overlooked in previous research. In this paper, we define personalized
instructions and introduce PerInstruct, a novel human-annotated dataset
covering diverse personalized instructions across various mobile scenarios.
Furthermore, given the limited personalization capabilities of existing mobile
agents, we propose PerPilot, a plug-and-play framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) that enables mobile agents to autonomously perceive,
understand, and execute personalized user instructions. PerPilot identifies
personalized elements and autonomously completes instructions via two
complementary approaches: memory-based retrieval and reasoning-based
exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that PerPilot effectively handles
personalized tasks with minimal user intervention and progressively improves
its performance with continued use, underscoring the importance of
personalization-aware reasoning for next-generation mobile agents. The dataset

Abstract: This paper investigates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
formulating and solving decision-making problems using mathematical
programming. We first conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of recent
literature to assess how well LLMs understand, structure, and solve
optimization problems across domains. The analysis is guided by critical review
questions focusing on learning approaches, dataset designs, evaluation metrics,
and prompting strategies. Our systematic evidence is complemented by targeted
experiments designed to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in
automatically generating optimization models for problems in computer networks.
Using a newly constructed dataset, we apply three prompting strategies:
Act-as-expert, chain-of-thought, and self-consistency, and evaluate the
obtained outputs based on optimality gap, token-level F1 score, and compilation
accuracy. Results show promising progress in LLMs' ability to parse natural
language and represent symbolic formulations, but also reveal key limitations
in accuracy, scalability, and interpretability. These empirical gaps motivate
several future research directions, including structured datasets,
domain-specific fine-tuning, hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches, modular
multi-agent architectures, and dynamic retrieval via chain-of-RAGs. This paper
contributes a structured roadmap for advancing LLM capabilities in mathematical
programming.

Abstract: Imagine decision-makers uploading data and, within minutes, receiving clear,
actionable insights delivered straight to their fingertips. That is the promise
of the AI Data Scientist, an autonomous Agent powered by large language models
(LLMs) that closes the gap between evidence and action. Rather than simply
writing code or responding to prompts, it reasons through questions, tests
ideas, and delivers end-to-end insights at a pace far beyond traditional
workflows. Guided by the scientific tenet of the hypothesis, this Agent
uncovers explanatory patterns in data, evaluates their statistical
significance, and uses them to inform predictive modeling. It then translates
these results into recommendations that are both rigorous and accessible. At
the core of the AI Data Scientist is a team of specialized LLM Subagents, each
responsible for a distinct task such as data cleaning, statistical testing,
validation, and plain-language communication. These Subagents write their own
code, reason about causality, and identify when additional data is needed to
support sound conclusions. Together, they achieve in minutes what might
otherwise take days or weeks, enabling a new kind of interaction that makes
deep data science both accessible and actionable.

### [353] [SEAM: Semantically Equivalent Across Modalities Benchmark for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18179)
*Zhenwei Tang,Difan Jiao,Blair Yang,Ashton Anderson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SEAM是一个新的基准测试，通过将语义等效的输入在四个领域进行配对，评估视觉语言模型在不同表示形式下的推理一致性，发现视觉模态通常落后于语言模态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估视觉语言模型在不同表示形式下的推理一致性具有挑战性，因为模态比较通常受到任务差异和不对称信息的干扰。

Method: 引入SEAM基准测试，在四个具有标准化文本和视觉符号的领域中配对语义等效的输入，使用不同的符号系统进行跨模态比较，而非基于OCR的图像-文本配对。

Result: 在21个当代模型中观察到系统性的模态不平衡：视觉性能通常落后于语言性能，尽管问题包含语义等效信息，跨模态一致性相对较低。错误分析显示主要驱动因素是领域符号中的文本感知失败和导致幻觉的视觉感知失败。

Conclusion: SEAM建立了一个受控的语义等效环境，用于测量和改进模态无关的推理能力，结果表明结果对视觉变换具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Evaluating whether vision-language models (VLMs) reason consistently across
representations is challenging because modality comparisons are typically
confounded by task differences and asymmetric information. We introduce SEAM, a
benchmark that pairs semantically equivalent inputs across four domains that
have existing standardized textual and visual notations. By employing distinct
notation systems across modalities, in contrast to OCR-based image-text
pairing, SEAM provides a rigorous comparative assessment of the
textual-symbolic and visual-spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Across 21
contemporary models, we observe systematic modality imbalance: vision
frequently lags language in overall performance, despite the problems
containing semantically equivalent information, and cross-modal agreement is
relatively low. Our error analysis reveals two main drivers: textual perception
failures from tokenization in domain notation and visual perception failures
that induce hallucinations. We also show that our results are largely robust to
visual transformations. SEAM establishes a controlled, semantically equivalent
setting for measuring and improving modality-agnostic reasoning.

*Zirui Tang,Boyu Niu,Xuanhe Zhou,Boxiu Li,Wei Zhou,Jiannan Wang,Guoliang Li,Xinyi Zhang,Fan Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ST-Raptor是一个基于树结构的框架，使用大语言模型处理半结构化表格问答，通过分层正交树表示复杂表格布局，定义树操作指导LLM执行任务，并采用两阶段验证机制，在真实数据集上比基线方法准确率提升20%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半结构化表格（如财务报表、医疗记录）在现实应用中广泛存在，但复杂的布局（分层表头、合并单元格）使得自动化问答面临挑战。现有方法要么信息损失严重，要么无法准确理解复杂布局。

Method: 提出分层正交树（HO-Tree）结构模型表示表格布局，定义基本树操作指导LLM执行问答任务，将复杂问题分解为子问题并生成操作流水线，采用前向验证（检查执行步骤）和后向验证（从答案重构查询评估可靠性）的两阶段验证机制。

Result: 在SSTQA数据集（102个真实半结构化表格上的764个问题）上的实验表明，ST-Raptor比9个基线方法准确率提升高达20%。

Conclusion: ST-Raptor框架有效解决了半结构化表格问答的挑战，通过树结构表示和操作指导显著提升了LLM在复杂表格布局下的问答准确性，为实际应用提供了可行的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Semi-structured tables, widely used in real-world applications (e.g.,
financial reports, medical records, transactional orders), often involve
flexible and complex layouts (e.g., hierarchical headers and merged cells).
These tables generally rely on human analysts to interpret table layouts and
answer relevant natural language questions, which is costly and inefficient. To
automate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First,
methods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured
ones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like
NL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of
semi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To
this end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured
table question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the
Hierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures
complex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for
constructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to
guide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor
decomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree
operation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate
pipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism:
forward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward
validation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from
predicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of
764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables. Experiments show that
ST-Raptor outperforms nine baselines by up to 20% in answer accuracy. The code
is available at https://github.com/weAIDB/ST-Raptor.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于网络的分析框架，将认知科学原理与机器学习相结合，通过模块化社区分析揭示了大语言模型的认知技能分布模式，发现其与生物认知系统的异同点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然应用广泛，但其内部机制被数十亿参数和复杂结构所隐藏，难以理解其内部架构和认知过程。研究旨在填补这一空白，借鉴生物学中认知理解的方法来分析LLM的涌现认知。

Method: 开发了一个基于网络的框架，将认知技能、LLM架构和数据集联系起来。通过分析模块社区中的技能分布，比较LLM与生物认知系统的异同。

Result: 研究发现LLM虽然不像特定生物系统那样具有严格的局部专业化，但表现出独特的模块社区，其涌现技能模式部分反映了鸟类和小型哺乳动物大脑中分布式但相互连接的认知组织。数值结果显示LLM技能获取显著受益于动态的跨区域交互和神经可塑性。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM可解释性提供了新见解，建议有效的微调策略应利用分布式学习动态而非刚性模块干预，实现了基础模型分析范式的转变。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped our world with significant
advancements in science, engineering, and society through applications ranging
from scientific discoveries and medical diagnostics to Chatbots. Despite their
ubiquity and utility, the underlying mechanisms of LLM remain concealed within
billions of parameters and complex structures, making their inner architecture
and cognitive processes challenging to comprehend. We address this gap by
adopting approaches to understanding emerging cognition in biology and
developing a network-based framework that links cognitive skills, LLM
architectures, and datasets, ushering in a paradigm shift in foundation model
analysis. The skill distribution in the module communities demonstrates that
while LLMs do not strictly parallel the focalized specialization observed in
specific biological systems, they exhibit unique communities of modules whose
emergent skill patterns partially mirror the distributed yet interconnected
cognitive organization seen in avian and small mammalian brains. Our numerical
results highlight a key divergence from biological systems to LLMs, where skill
acquisition benefits substantially from dynamic, cross-regional interactions
and neural plasticity. By integrating cognitive science principles with machine
learning, our framework provides new insights into LLM interpretability and
suggests that effective fine-tuning strategies should leverage distributed
learning dynamics rather than rigid modular interventions.

TL;DR: 本研究通过系统训练不同规模、训练量和数据类型的DINOv3视觉变换器模型，发现模型大小、训练量和图像类型都独立且交互地影响AI模型与人类大脑表征的相似性。最大的DINOv3模型使用最接近人类视觉经验的图像训练时，达到最高的脑相似性。

Motivation: 理解AI模型为何会发展出与人类大脑相似的表征，以及模型架构、训练过程和数据如何独立影响这种脑模型相似性。

Method: 训练一系列自监督视觉变换器(DINOv3)，系统改变模型大小、训练量和图像类型。使用fMRI和MEG记录的人类大脑数据进行比较，采用三种互补指标评估表征相似性、地形组织和时间动态。

Result: 所有三个因素都独立且交互地影响脑相似性指标。最大模型使用最人类中心图像时达到最高相似性。训练过程中，模型先与感觉皮层早期表征对齐，需要更多训练才能与前额叶晚期表征对齐。这种发展轨迹与人类皮层的结构和功能特性相关。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了架构和经验在塑造人工神经网络如何像人类一样看待世界方面的相互作用，为理解人类大脑如何表征视觉世界提供了有前景的框架。

Abstract: Many AI models trained on natural images develop representations that
resemble those of the human brain. However, the factors that drive this
brain-model similarity remain poorly understood. To disentangle how the model,
training and data independently lead a neural network to develop brain-like
representations, we trained a family of self-supervised vision transformers
(DINOv3) that systematically varied these different factors. We compare their
representations of images to those of the human brain recorded with both fMRI
and MEG, providing high resolution in spatial and temporal analyses. We assess
the brain-model similarity with three complementary metrics focusing on overall
representational similarity, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics.
We show that all three factors - model size, training amount, and image type -
independently and interactively impact each of these brain similarity metrics.
In particular, the largest DINOv3 models trained with the most human-centric
images reach the highest brain-similarity. This emergence of brain-like
representations in AI models follows a specific chronology during training:
models first align with the early representations of the sensory cortices, and
only align with the late and prefrontal representations of the brain with
considerably more training. Finally, this developmental trajectory is indexed
by both structural and functional properties of the human cortex: the
representations that are acquired last by the models specifically align with
the cortical areas with the largest developmental expansion, thickness, least
myelination, and slowest timescales. Overall, these findings disentangle the
interplay between architecture and experience in shaping how artificial neural
networks come to see the world as humans do, thus offering a promising
framework to understand how the human brain comes to represent its visual
world.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了计算Blackwell最优策略的新算法，通过有理函数排序方法，为确定性MDP提供了首个强多项式时间算法，为一般MDP提供了首个亚指数时间算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MDP最优性准则（折扣和平均奖励）存在局限性：折扣最优性过于关注短期奖励，平均最优性需要强结构假设。Blackwell最优性虽然理论上更全面，但现有算法计算成本高或难以实现。

Method: 使用有理函数在1附近的排序方法，将最先进算法中的数值计算替换为有理函数的符号操作，从而得到与比特复杂度无关的边界。对确定性和一般MDP分别设计算法。

Result: 为确定性MDP提供了首个强多项式时间算法，为一般MDP提供了首个亚指数时间算法，并将策略迭代算法的最优上界从折扣准则扩展到Blackwell准则。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了Blackwell最优策略计算难题，在计算复杂度和算法实现方面取得了显著进展，扩展了MDP最优性理论的实际应用能力。

Abstract: Markov Decision Problems (MDPs) provide a foundational framework for
modelling sequential decision-making across diverse domains, guided by
optimality criteria such as discounted and average rewards. However, these
criteria have inherent limitations: discounted optimality may overly prioritise
short-term rewards, while average optimality relies on strong structural
assumptions. Blackwell optimality addresses these challenges, offering a robust
and comprehensive criterion that ensures optimality under both discounted and
average reward frameworks. Despite its theoretical appeal, existing algorithms
for computing Blackwell Optimal (BO) policies are computationally expensive or
hard to implement.
  In this paper we describe procedures for computing BO policies using an
ordering of rational functions in the vicinity of $1$. We adapt
state-of-the-art algorithms for deterministic and general MDPs, replacing
numerical evaluations with symbolic operations on rational functions to derive
bounds independent of bit complexity. For deterministic MDPs, we give the first
strongly polynomial-time algorithms for computing BO policies, and for general
MDPs we obtain the first subexponential-time algorithm. We further generalise
several policy iteration algorithms, extending the best known upper bounds from
the discounted to the Blackwell criterion.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出量子启发深度强化学习框架(QI-DRL)，整合LSTM和Ornstein-Uhlenbeck噪声，用于纺织品切割订单规划优化，相比传统方法节省13%面料成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于静态启发式和目录估算的方法难以适应动态生产环境，导致解决方案次优和浪费增加，需要更智能的自适应优化方法。

Method: 量子启发深度强化学习框架，结合LSTM网络捕获序列依赖关系，使用Ornstein-Uhlenbeck噪声促进平滑探索和快速收敛。

Result: 经过1000轮训练，平均奖励0.81(±0.03)，预测损失降至0.15(±0.02)，面料成本节省达13%，具有低变异性和稳定收敛性。

Conclusion: 该可扩展自适应框架展现了提升制造效率的潜力，为切割订单规划优化领域的未来创新铺平了道路。

Abstract: Cut order planning (COP) is a critical challenge in the textile industry,
directly impacting fabric utilization and production costs. Conventional
methods based on static heuristics and catalog-based estimations often struggle
to adapt to dynamic production environments, resulting in suboptimal solutions
and increased waste. In response, we propose a novel Quantum-Inspired Deep
Reinforcement Learning (QI-DRL) framework that integrates Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) networks with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise. This hybrid approach is
designed to explicitly address key research questions regarding the benefits of
quantum-inspired probabilistic representations, the role of LSTM-based memory
in capturing sequential dependencies, and the effectiveness of OU noise in
facilitating smooth exploration and faster convergence. Extensive training over
1000 episodes demonstrates robust performance, with an average reward of 0.81
(-+0.03) and a steady decrease in prediction loss to 0.15 (-+0.02). A
comparative analysis reveals that the proposed approach achieves fabric cost
savings of up to 13% compared to conventional methods. Furthermore, statistical
evaluations indicate low variability and stable convergence. Despite the fact
that the simulation model makes several simplifying assumptions, these
promising results underscore the potential of the scalable and adaptive
framework to enhance manufacturing efficiency and pave the way for future
innovations in COP optimization.

Motivation: 挑战当前架构复杂化的趋势，证明在数据有限的科学领域中，精心设计的简单架构比容易过拟合的复杂替代方案更有效。

Method: 采用统一的Transformer架构，将晶格和原子特性视为单一相互依赖系统，结合基于元素周期表的原子表示和平衡训练策略。

Result: 在MP-20数据集上达到9.62%的SUN率（稳定、独特、新颖），显著优于FlowMM（4.38%）和MatterGen（3.42%），生成了63.28%独特新颖的结构。

Conclusion: 架构简单性在材料发现中比复杂性更有效，特别是在数据有限的科学领域中，简单但精心设计的架构能够避免过拟合问题。

Abstract: We present CrystalDiT, a diffusion transformer for crystal structure
generation that achieves state-of-the-art performance by challenging the trend
of architectural complexity. Instead of intricate, multi-stream designs,
CrystalDiT employs a unified transformer that imposes a powerful inductive
bias: treating lattice and atomic properties as a single, interdependent
system. Combined with a periodic table-based atomic representation and a
balanced training strategy, our approach achieves 9.62% SUN (Stable, Unique,
Novel) rate on MP-20, substantially outperforming recent methods including
FlowMM (4.38%) and MatterGen (3.42%). Notably, CrystalDiT generates 63.28%
unique and novel structures while maintaining comparable stability rates,
demonstrating that architectural simplicity can be more effective than
complexity for materials discovery. Our results suggest that in data-limited
scientific domains, carefully designed simple architectures outperform
sophisticated alternatives that are prone to overfitting.

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的数据流异常检测方法DyCF和DyCG，基于Christoffel函数理论，无需复杂参数调优，在计算效率和内存使用方面表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据流异常检测在数据挖掘中至关重要，但现有方法存在参数调优复杂的问题，需要开发更简单有效的解决方案

Method: DyCF利用近似理论和正交多项式中的Christoffel函数，DyCG利用Christoffel函数的增长特性，两者都基于明确定义的代数框架，无需调参

Result: 实验表明DyCF在执行时间和内存使用方面优于现有方法，DyCG虽然性能稍差但完全无需调参，具有显著优势

Conclusion: 这两种新方法为数据流异常检测提供了有效的解决方案，特别适合处理低维数据流和历史数据维护，具有重要的实用价值

Abstract: Outlier detection holds significant importance in the realm of data mining,
particularly with the growing pervasiveness of data acquisition methods. The
ability to identify outliers in data streams is essential for maintaining data
quality and detecting faults. However, dealing with data streams presents
challenges due to the non-stationary nature of distributions and the
ever-increasing data volume. While numerous methods have been proposed to
tackle this challenge, a common drawback is the lack of straightforward
parameterization in many of them. This article introduces two novel methods:
DyCF and DyCG. DyCF leverages the Christoffel function from the theory of
approximation and orthogonal polynomials. Conversely, DyCG capitalizes on the
growth properties of the Christoffel function, eliminating the need for tuning
parameters. Both approaches are firmly rooted in a well-defined algebraic
framework, meeting crucial demands for data stream processing, with a specific
focus on addressing low-dimensional aspects and maintaining data history
without memory cost. A comprehensive comparison between DyCF, DyCG, and
state-of-the-art methods is presented, using both synthetic and real industrial
data streams. The results show that DyCF outperforms fine-tuning methods,
offering superior performance in terms of execution time and memory usage. DyCG
performs less well, but has the considerable advantage of requiring no tuning
at all.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有位置预测方法主要依赖历史轨迹数据，但忽视了未来时空上下文的重要性。例如，知道用户将要旅行的时间和距离可以为预测下一个位置提供关键线索。

Method: STRelay以接力方式建模未来时空上下文，与基础位置预测模型的历史表示集成，通过多任务学习同时预测下一个时间间隔、移动距离间隔和最终位置。

Result: 在四个真实世界轨迹数据集上，STRelay与四种最先进的基础模型集成后，性能一致提升3.19%-11.56%，特别对娱乐相关位置和长途旅行用户群体效果显著。

Conclusion: 未来时空上下文对于非日常例行活动（如娱乐）具有重要价值，能够补充基础模型在建模常规日常模式方面的优势，特别是在不确定性较高的场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Next location prediction is a critical task in human mobility modeling,
enabling applications like travel planning and urban mobility management.
Existing methods mainly rely on historical spatiotemporal trajectory data to
train sequence models that directly forecast future locations. However, they
often overlook the importance of the future spatiotemporal contexts, which are
highly informative for the future locations. For example, knowing how much time
and distance a user will travel could serve as a critical clue for predicting
the user's next location. Against this background, we propose \textbf{STRelay},
a universal \textbf{\underline{S}}patio\textbf{\underline{T}}emporal
\textbf{\underline{Relay}}ing framework explicitly modeling the future
spatiotemporal context given a human trajectory, to boost the performance of
different location prediction models. Specifically, STRelay models future
spatiotemporal contexts in a relaying manner, which is subsequently integrated
with the encoded historical representation from a base location prediction
model, enabling multi-task learning by simultaneously predicting the next time
interval, next moving distance interval, and finally the next location. We
evaluate STRelay integrated with four state-of-the-art location prediction base
models on four real-world trajectory datasets. Results demonstrate that STRelay
consistently improves prediction performance across all cases by
3.19\%-11.56\%. Additionally, we find that the future spatiotemporal contexts
are particularly helpful for entertainment-related locations and also for user
groups who prefer traveling longer distances. The performance gain on such
non-daily-routine activities, which often suffer from higher uncertainty, is
indeed complementary to the base location prediction models that often excel at
modeling regular daily routine patterns.

Conclusion: RAST框架通过集成检索增强机制与时空建模，有效提升了交通预测的性能，为解决复杂时空依赖和细粒度预测问题提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: Traffic prediction is a cornerstone of modern intelligent transportation
systems and a critical task in spatio-temporal forecasting. Although advanced
Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) and pre-trained models have
achieved significant progress in traffic prediction, two key challenges remain:
(i) limited contextual capacity when modeling complex spatio-temporal
dependencies, and (ii) low predictability at fine-grained spatio-temporal
points due to heterogeneous patterns. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG), we propose RAST, a universal framework that integrates
retrieval-augmented mechanisms with spatio-temporal modeling to address these
challenges. Our framework consists of three key designs: 1) Decoupled Encoder
and Query Generator to capture decoupled spatial and temporal features and
construct a fusion query via residual fusion; 2) Spatio-temporal Retrieval
Store and Retrievers to maintain and retrieve vectorized fine-grained patterns;
and 3) Universal Backbone Predictor that flexibly accommodates pre-trained
STGNNs or simple MLP predictors. Extensive experiments on six real-world
traffic networks, including large-scale datasets, demonstrate that RAST
achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: LLM-based agents have been extensively applied across various domains, where
memory stands out as one of their most essential capabilities. Previous memory
mechanisms of LLM-based agents are manually predefined by human experts,
leading to higher labor costs and suboptimal performance. In addition, these
methods overlook the memory cycle effect in interactive scenarios, which is
critical to optimizing LLM-based agents for specific environments. To address
these challenges, in this paper, we propose to optimize LLM-based agents with
an adaptive and data-driven memory framework by modeling memory cycles.
Specifically, we design an MoE gate function to facilitate memory retrieval,
propose a learnable aggregation process to improve memory utilization, and
develop task-specific reflection to adapt memory storage. Our memory framework

### [365] [Recurrent Transformer U-Net Surrogate for Flow Modeling and Data Assimilation in Subsurface Formations with Faults](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16631)
*Yifu Han,Louis J. Durlofsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 基于变奇器U-Net的代模型，用于地层碳存存储中的压力和CO2饱和度预测，考虑断层漏泉和层次不确定性，通过敏感性分析和数据同化评估监测策略效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地层碳存存储中的断层会强烈影响流体流动，并可能作为CO2漏泉途径，需要快速准确的预测模型来处理层次不确定性和评估监测策略。

Method: 开发了新的变奇器U-Net代模型，训练使用4000个随机采样实现的模拟结果，考虑地层异质性、断层漏泉和层次不确定性，并进行全局敏感性分析和马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛数据同化。

Result: 新代模模型比之前的殊留U-Net更准确，在不同漏泉场景下保持准确性。后验结果显示，在所有三个水层中测量压力和饱和度可以最大程度地减少CO2漏泉量和3D饱和度缅的不确定性。

Conclusion: 变奇器U-Net代模型能够有效处理地层碳存存储中的复杂地质条件和不确定性，为监测策略的优化提供了量化支持，显示在所有水层进行多参数监测的重要性。

Abstract: Many subsurface formations, including some of those under consideration for
large-scale geological carbon storage, include extensive faults that can
strongly impact fluid flow. In this study, we develop a new recurrent
transformer U-Net surrogate model to provide very fast predictions for pressure
and CO2 saturation in realistic faulted subsurface aquifer systems. The
geomodel includes a target aquifer (into which supercritical CO2 is injected),
surrounding regions, caprock, two extensive faults, and two overlying aquifers.
The faults can act as leakage pathways between the three aquifers. The
heterogeneous property fields in the target aquifer are characterized by
hierarchical uncertainty, meaning both the geological metaparameters (e.g.,
mean and standard deviation of log-permeability) and the detailed cell
properties of each realization, are uncertain. Fault permeabilities are also
treated as uncertain. The model is trained with simulation results for (up to)
4000 randomly sampled realizations. Error assessments show that this model is
more accurate than a previous recurrent residual U-Net, and that it maintains
accuracy for qualitatively different leakage scenarios. The new surrogate is
then used for global sensitivity analysis and data assimilation. A hierarchical
Markov chain Monte Carlo data assimilation procedure is applied. Different
monitoring strategies, corresponding to different amounts and types of observed
data collected at monitoring wells, are considered for three synthetic true
models. Detailed results demonstrate the degree of uncertainty reduction
achieved with the various monitoring strategies. Posterior results for 3D
saturation plumes and leakage volumes indicate the benefits of measuring
pressure and saturation in all three aquifers.

improvements over existing approaches such as Variational Continual Learning
and Elastic Weight Consolidation . The asymmetric variance penalty mechanism
proves particularly effective in maintaining knowledge across sequential tasks
while improving model accuracy. Experimental results show our approach not only
boosts immediate task performance but also significantly mitigates knowledge
degradation over time, effectively addressing the fundamental challenge of
catastrophic forgetting in neural networks

*Yunyan Zheng,Zhichao Zhang,Wei Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了统一扩展矩阵(UEM)框架来解决传统图移位算子在建模非相邻节点依赖关系方面的局限性，通过参数化设计整合扩展邻接矩阵和统一图表示矩阵，从而更好地适应不同图结构并揭示更多图信号信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图移位算子(GSOs)在建模非相邻节点之间的依赖关系方面缺乏灵活性，限制了其表示复杂图结构的能力，需要一种更灵活的框架来增强图信号处理性能。

Method: 提出了统一扩展矩阵(UEM)框架，通过参数化设计整合扩展邻接矩阵和统一图表示矩阵，并基于UEM提出了图傅里叶变换(UEM-GFT)，能够自适应调整频谱特性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验结果表明，UEM-GFT在异常检测任务中优于现有的基于GSO的方法，在不同网络拓扑结构下都表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: UEM框架有效解决了传统图移位算子的局限性，提供了更灵活的图信号处理工具，在异常检测等任务中展现出显著优势。

Abstract: Graph signal processing has become an essential tool for analyzing data
structured on irregular domains. While conventional graph shift operators
(GSOs) are effective for certain tasks, they inherently lack flexibility in
modeling dependencies between non-adjacent nodes, limiting their ability to
represent complex graph structures. To address this limitation, this paper
proposes the unified extended matrix (UEM) framework, which integrates the
extended-adjacency matrix and the unified graph representation matrix through
parametric design, so as to be able to flexibly adapt to different graph
structures and reveal more graph signal information. Theoretical analysis of
the UEM is conducted, demonstrating positive semi-definiteness and eigenvalue
monotonicity under specific conditions. Then, we propose graph Fourier
transform based on UEM (UEM-GFT), which can adaptively tune spectral properties
to enhance signal processing performance. Experimental results on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that the UEM-GFT outperforms existing GSO-based
methods in anomaly detection tasks, achieving superior performance across
varying network topologies.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于双粒度表示的双粒度引导网络(DGGN)，用于解决少样本类增量故障诊断中的灾难性遗忘和新数据过拟合问题，在TEP基准和真实MFF数据集上表现出优越性能。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本类增量故障诊断(FSC-FD)在实际工业系统中至关重要，但面临着灾难性遗忘旧知识和稀缺新数据过拟合的双重挑战，需要新的方法来解决这些问题。

Conclusion: DGGN通过双粒度表示和动态融合机制有效缓解了少样本类增量学习中的灾难性遗忘和过拟合问题，为工业故障诊断提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Fault Diagnosis (FSC-FD), which aims to
continuously learn from new fault classes with only a few samples without
forgetting old ones, is critical for real-world industrial systems. However,
this challenging task severely amplifies the issues of catastrophic forgetting
of old knowledge and overfitting on scarce new data. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework built upon Dual-Granularity
Representations, termed the Dual-Granularity Guidance Network (DGGN). Our DGGN
explicitly decouples feature learning into two parallel streams: 1) a
fine-grained representation stream, which utilizes a novel Multi-Order
Interaction Aggregation module to capture discriminative, class-specific
features from the limited new samples. 2) a coarse-grained representation
stream, designed to model and preserve general, class-agnostic knowledge shared
across all fault types. These two representations are dynamically fused by a
multi-semantic cross-attention mechanism, where the stable coarse-grained
knowledge guides the learning of fine-grained features, preventing overfitting
and alleviating feature conflicts. To further mitigate catastrophic forgetting,
we design a Boundary-Aware Exemplar Prioritization strategy. Moreover, a
decoupled Balanced Random Forest classifier is employed to counter the decision
boundary bias caused by data imbalance. Extensive experiments on the TEP
benchmark and a real-world MFF dataset demonstrate that our proposed DGGN
achieves superior diagnostic performance and stability compared to
state-of-the-art FSC-FD approaches. Our code is publicly available at

### [369] [Enhancing Transformer-Based Foundation Models for Time Series Forecasting via Bagging, Boosting and Statistical Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16641)
*Dhruv D. Modi,Rong Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了统计和集成增强技术来改进时间序列基础模型的预测性能，包括bagging、stacking、预测区间构建、残差建模等方法，在电力负荷预测数据集上验证了这些混合方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管时间序列基础模型(TSFMs)在时间序列任务中表现出强大的泛化和零样本能力，但在实际部署中仍存在方差大、领域特定偏差和不确定性量化有限等问题，需要改进其鲁棒性和准确性。

Method: 提出了一套统计和集成增强技术，包括基于bootstrap的bagging、基于回归的stacking、预测区间构建、统计残差建模和迭代误差反馈等方法，将这些技术与基础模型结合形成混合方法。

Result: 在比利时电力短期负荷预测数据集上的实验表明，所提出的混合方法在多个预测时域上持续优于独立的基础模型：回归集成获得最低均方误差，bootstrap聚合显著减少长上下文误差，残差建模纠正系统偏差，预测区间实现接近名义覆盖率且宽度随上下文长度增加而缩小。

Conclusion: 将统计推理与现代基础模型相结合，可以在实际时间序列应用中显著提高准确性、可靠性和可解释性，为时间序列基础模型的实用化提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) such as Lag-Llama, TimeGPT, Chronos,
MOMENT, UniTS, and TimesFM have shown strong generalization and zero-shot
capabilities for time series forecasting, anomaly detection, classification,
and imputation. Despite these advantages, their predictions still suffer from
variance, domain-specific bias, and limited uncertainty quantification when
deployed on real operational data. This paper investigates a suite of
statistical and ensemble-based enhancement techniques, including
bootstrap-based bagging, regression-based stacking, prediction interval
construction, statistical residual modeling, and iterative error feedback, to
improve robustness and accuracy. Using the Belgium Electricity Short-Term Load
Forecasting dataset as a case study, we demonstrate that the proposed hybrids
consistently outperform standalone foundation models across multiple horizons.
Regression-based ensembles achieve the lowest mean squared error; bootstrap
aggregation markedly reduces long-context errors; residual modeling corrects
systematic bias; and the resulting prediction intervals achieve near nominal
coverage with widths shrinking as context length increases. The results
indicate that integrating statistical reasoning with modern foundation models
yields measurable gains in accuracy, reliability, and interpretability for
real-world time series applications.

Abstract: From large language models to multi-modal agents, Generative Artificial
Intelligence (AI) now underpins state-of-the-art systems. Despite their varied
architectures, many share a common foundation in probabilistic latent variable
models (PLVMs), where hidden variables explain observed data for density
estimation, latent reasoning, and structured inference. This paper presents a
unified perspective by framing both classical and modern generative methods
within the PLVM paradigm. We trace the progression from classical flat models
such as probabilistic PCA, Gaussian mixture models, latent class analysis, item
response theory, and latent Dirichlet allocation, through their sequential
extensions including Hidden Markov Models, Gaussian HMMs, and Linear Dynamical
Systems, to contemporary deep architectures: Variational Autoencoders as Deep
PLVMs, Normalizing Flows as Tractable PLVMs, Diffusion Models as Sequential
PLVMs, Autoregressive Models as Explicit Generative Models, and Generative
Adversarial Networks as Implicit PLVMs. Viewing these architectures under a
common probabilistic taxonomy reveals shared principles, distinct inference
strategies, and the representational trade-offs that shape their strengths. We
offer a conceptual roadmap that consolidates generative AI's theoretical
foundations, clarifies methodological lineages, and guides future innovation by
grounding emerging architectures in their probabilistic heritage.

Conclusion: AdapSNE有效解决了边缘设备数据集采样中的异常值和采样偏差问题，在保证训练精度的同时大幅降低了计算开销，为边缘设备上的高效神经网络训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) directly on edge devices has attracted
increasing attention, as it offers promising solutions to challenges such as
domain adaptation and privacy preservation. However, conventional DNN training
typically requires large-scale datasets, which imposes prohibitive overhead on
edge devices-particularly for emerging large language model (LLM) tasks. To
address this challenge, a DNN-free method (ie., dataset sampling without DNN),
named NMS (Near-Memory Sampling), has been introduced. By first conducting
dimensionality reduction of the dataset and then performing exemplar sampling
in the reduced space, NMS avoids the architectural bias inherent in DNN-based
methods and thus achieves better generalization. However, The state-of-the-art,
NMS, suffers from two limitations: (1) The mismatch between the search method
and the non-monotonic property of the perplexity error function leads to the
emergence of outliers in the reduced representation; (2) Key parameter (ie.,
target perplexity) is selected empirically, introducing arbitrariness and
leading to uneven sampling. These two issues lead to representative bias of
examplars, resulting in degraded accuracy. To address these issues, we propose
AdapSNE, which integrates an efficient non-monotonic search method-namely, the
Fireworks Algorithm (FWA)-to suppress outliers, and employs entropy-guided
optimization to enforce uniform sampling, thereby ensuring representative
training samples and consequently boosting training accuracy. To cut the
edge-side cost arising from the iterative computations of FWA search and
entropy-guided optimization, we design an accelerator with custom dataflow and
time-multiplexing markedly reducing on-device training energy and area.

Motivation: 解决PIV实验中获取时空高分辨率湍流尾流场的硬件限制和测量噪声问题，利用更易获得的高频壁面压力测量来重建流场

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 训练压力条件β-VAE学习流场紧凑潜在表示；2) 次级网络将低频压力映射到潜在空间，推理时仅需高频壁面压力输入即可通过解码器生成高频流场

Result: 能够从稀疏的壁面压力信号重建512Hz的高频湍流尾流场，突破了传统PIV测量的频率限制

Conclusion: 通过解耦流场空间编码和压力时间测量，为数据受限的实验环境提供了可扩展且鲁棒的高频湍流重建解决方案

Abstract: Acquiring temporally high-frequency and spatially high-resolution turbulent
wake flow fields in particle image velocimetry (PIV) experiments remains a
significant challenge due to hardware limitations and measurement noise. In
contrast, temporal high-frequency measurements of spatially sparse wall
pressure are more readily accessible in wind tunnel experiments. In this study,
we propose a novel cross-modal temporal upscaling framework, LatentFlow, which
reconstructs high-frequency (512 Hz) turbulent wake flow fields by fusing
synchronized low-frequency (15 Hz) flow field and pressure data during
training, and high-frequency wall pressure signals during inference. The first
stage involves training a pressure-conditioned $\beta$-variation autoencoder
($p$C-$\beta$-VAE) to learn a compact latent representation that captures the
intrinsic dynamics of the wake flow. A secondary network maps synchronized
low-frequency wall pressure signals into the latent space, enabling
reconstruction of the wake flow field solely from sparse wall pressure. Once
trained, the model utilizes high-frequency, spatially sparse wall pressure
inputs to generate corresponding high-frequency flow fields via the
$p$C-$\beta$-VAE decoder. By decoupling the spatial encoding of flow dynamics
from temporal pressure measurements, LatentFlow provides a scalable and robust
solution for reconstructing high-frequency turbulent wake flows in
data-constrained experimental settings.

Abstract: We propose HiCL, a novel hippocampal-inspired dual-memory continual learning
architecture designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by using elements
inspired by the hippocampal circuitry. Our system encodes inputs through a
grid-cell-like layer, followed by sparse pattern separation using a dentate
gyrus-inspired module with top-k sparsity. Episodic memory traces are
maintained in a CA3-like autoassociative memory. Task-specific processing is
dynamically managed via a DG-gated mixture-of-experts mechanism, wherein inputs
are routed to experts based on cosine similarity between their normalized
sparse DG representations and learned task-specific DG prototypes computed
through online exponential moving averages. This biologically grounded yet
mathematically principled gating strategy enables differentiable, scalable
task-routing without relying on a separate gating network, and enhances the
model's adaptability and efficiency in learning multiple sequential tasks.
Cortical outputs are consolidated using Elastic Weight Consolidation weighted
by inter-task similarity. Crucially, we incorporate prioritized replay of
stored patterns to reinforce essential past experiences. Evaluations on
standard continual learning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
architecture in reducing task interference, achieving near state-of-the-art
results in continual learning tasks at lower computational costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的远程心率监测系统缺乏对患者实际物理活动数据的整合，导致难以准确评估心率变化的临床意义。虽然AI模型可以提高监测准确性，但活动数据的集成仍然很少被解决。

Method: 使用Transformer模型结合Laplace扩散技术，通过专门的嵌入和注意力机制将整个建模过程基于活动上下文，采用情境化嵌入和专用编码器来捕获长期模式和活动特定的心率动态。

Result: 在29名患者4个月的真实数据集上验证，模型相比现有最先进方法减少了43%的平均绝对误差，决定系数R2达到0.97，表明预测心率与实际心率高度一致。

Conclusion: 该模型是支持医疗保健提供者和远程患者监测系统的实用有效工具，能够显著提高心率监测的准确性和上下文理解能力。

Abstract: With the advent of wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices, remote patient
monitoring (RPM) emerged as a promising solution for managing heart failure.
However, the heart rate can fluctuate significantly due to various factors, and
without correlating it to the patient's actual physical activity, it becomes
difficult to assess whether changes are significant. Although Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models may enhance the accuracy and contextual understanding
of remote heart rate monitoring, the integration of activity data is still
rarely addressed. In this paper, we propose a Transformer model combined with a
Laplace diffusion technique to model heart rate fluctuations driven by physical
activity of the patient. Unlike prior models that treat activity as secondary,
our approach conditions the entire modeling process on activity context using
specialized embeddings and attention mechanisms to prioritize activity specific
historical patents. The model captures both long-term patterns and
activity-specific heart rate dynamics by incorporating contextualized
embeddings and dedicated encoder. The Transformer model was validated on a
real-world dataset collected from 29 patients over a 4-month period.
Experimental results show that our model outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods, achieving a 43% reduction in mean absolute error compared to the
considered baseline models. Moreover, the coefficient of determination R2 is
0.97 indicating the model predicted heart rate is in strong agreement with
actual heart rate values. These findings suggest that the proposed model is a
practical and effective tool for supporting both healthcare providers and
remote patient monitoring systems.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了类别不平衡预训练数据下的开放世界问题，通过对比学习和选择性激活机制实现了更好的性能和计算效率

Abstract: The expansion of machine learning into dynamic environments presents
challenges in handling open-world problems where label shift, covariate shift,
and unknown classes emerge. Post-training methods have been explored to address
these challenges, adapting models to newly emerging data. However, these
methods struggle when the initial pre-training is performed on class-imbalanced
datasets, limiting generalization to minority classes. To address this, we
propose a method that effectively handles open-world problems even when
pre-training is conducted on imbalanced data. Our contrastive-based
pre-training approach enhances classification performance, particularly for
underrepresented classes. Our post-training mechanism generates reliable
pseudo-labels, improving model robustness against open-world problems. We also
introduce selective activation criteria to optimize the post-training process,
reducing unnecessary computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art adaptation techniques in both
accuracy and efficiency across diverse open-world scenarios.

Conclusion: WISCA方法通过系统性优化权重模式，有效提升了Transformer大语言模型的训练效率和最终性能，为训练优化提供了新思路

Abstract: Transformer architecture gradually dominates the LLM field. Recent advances
in training optimization for Transformer-based large language models (LLMs)
primarily focus on architectural modifications or optimizer adjustments.
However, these approaches lack systematic optimization of weight patterns
during training. Weight pattern refers to the distribution and relative
magnitudes of weight parameters in a neural network. To address this issue, we
propose a Weight Scaling method called WISCA to enhance training efficiency and
model quality by strategically improving neural network weight patterns without
changing network structures. By rescaling weights while preserving model
outputs, WISCA indirectly optimizes the model's training trajectory.
Experiments demonstrate that WISCA significantly improves convergence quality
(measured by generalization capability and loss reduction), particularly in
LLMs with Grouped Query Attention (GQA) architectures and LoRA fine-tuning
tasks. Empirical results show 5.6% average improvement on zero-shot validation
tasks and 2.12% average reduction in training perplexity across multiple
architectures.

specifically design and optimize for the insertion problem within offline data.
By monitoring the ratio of entropy changes in the model concerning offline and
online data, we regulate the weight of offline-SFT, thereby addressing the
issues of insufficient exploration space in small models and the redundancy and
complexity during the distillation process. Furthermore, to tackle the
distribution discrepancies between offline data and the current policy, we
design a sample-accuracy-based policy shift mechanism that dynamically chooses
between imitating offline distilled data and learning from its own policy.

TL;DR: CALR是一种新型的LLM压缩方法，通过SVD低秩分解结合可学习的校正模块，在显著减少参数的同时保持模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVD压缩方法主要关注矩阵重构误差最小化，但会导致模型功能性能显著下降，需要解决压缩过程中的功能信息损失问题

Method: CALR采用双组件压缩方法：主路径为SVD压缩层，并行路径为可学习的低秩校正模块，专门训练用于恢复功能残差误差

Result: 在多个模型上实现26.93%-51.77%的参数减少，同时保持59.45%-90.42%的原始性能，优于LaCo、ShortGPT和LoSparse等方法

Conclusion: 将功能信息损失视为可学习信号是一种高效的压缩范式，能够创建更小更高效的LLM，提升实际部署的可行性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to
their immense size and computational requirements. Model compression techniques
are essential for making these models practical for resource-constrained
environments. A prominent compression strategy is low-rank factorization via
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce model parameters by approximating
weight matrices. However, standard SVD focuses on minimizing matrix
reconstruction error, often leading to a substantial loss of the model's
functional performance. This performance degradation occurs because existing
methods do not adequately correct for the functional information lost during
compression. To address this gap, we introduce Corrective Adaptive Low-Rank
Decomposition (CALR), a two-component compression approach. CALR combines a
primary path of SVD-compressed layers with a parallel, learnable, low-rank
corrective module that is explicitly trained to recover the functional residual
error. Our experimental evaluation on SmolLM2-135M, Qwen3-0.6B, and
Llama-3.2-1B, demonstrates that CALR can reduce parameter counts by 26.93% to
51.77% while retaining 59.45% to 90.42% of the original model's performance,
consistently outperforming LaCo, ShortGPT, and LoSparse. CALR's success shows
that treating functional information loss as a learnable signal is a highly
effective compression paradigm. This approach enables the creation of
significantly smaller, more efficient LLMs, advancing their accessibility and
practical deployment in real-world applications.

Motivation: 准确及时的交通流预测对智能交通系统至关重要，现有方法在时空依赖建模方面存在局限性

Result: 在PEMS-BAY和SHMetro数据集上表现出优于最先进基线的性能，可视化显示能适应动态交通模式并捕捉长程依赖

Conclusion: STGAtt模型在交通流预测方面具有显著优势，展现了在现实世界应用中的潜力

Abstract: Accurate and timely traffic flow forecasting is crucial for intelligent
transportation systems. This paper presents a novel deep learning model, the
Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph Attention Network (STGAtt). By leveraging a
unified graph representation and an attention mechanism, STGAtt effectively
captures complex spatial-temporal dependencies. Unlike methods relying on
separate spatial and temporal dependency modeling modules, STGAtt directly
models correlations within a Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph, dynamically
weighing connections across both dimensions. To further enhance its
capabilities, STGAtt partitions traffic flow observation signal into
neighborhood subsets and employs a novel exchanging mechanism, enabling
effective capture of both short-range and long-range correlations. Extensive
experiments on the PEMS-BAY and SHMetro datasets demonstrate STGAtt's superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines across various prediction
horizons. Visualization of attention weights confirms STGAtt's ability to adapt
to dynamic traffic patterns and capture long-range dependencies, highlighting
its potential for real-world traffic flow forecasting applications.

Conclusion: 该框架为科学模型中的不确定性感知预测提供了有效解决方案，可扩展到更复杂的分布族。

Abstract: Accurate quantification of uncertainty in neural network predictions remains
a central challenge for scientific applications involving high-dimensional,
correlated data. While existing methods capture either aleatoric or epistemic
uncertainty, few offer closed-form, multidimensional distributions that
preserve spatial correlation while remaining computationally tractable. In this
work, we present a framework for training neural networks with a
multidimensional Gaussian loss, generating closed-form predictive distributions
over outputs with non-identically distributed and heteroscedastic structure.
Our approach captures aleatoric uncertainty by iteratively estimating the means
and covariance matrices, and is demonstrated on a super-resolution example. We
leverage a Fourier representation of the covariance matrix to stabilize network
training and preserve spatial correlation. We introduce a novel regularization
strategy -- referred to as information sharing -- that interpolates between
image-specific and global covariance estimates, enabling convergence of the
super-resolution downscaling network trained on image-specific distributional
loss functions. This framework allows for efficient sampling, explicit
correlation modeling, and extensions to more complex distribution families all
without disrupting prediction performance. We demonstrate the method on a
surface wind speed downscaling task and discuss its broader applicability to
uncertainty-aware prediction in scientific models.

Conclusion: 子空间嵌入为概念表示提供了新的几何基础范式，既保持几何可解释性又支持逻辑操作，在推理任务中表现出色

Abstract: Traditional neural embeddings represent concepts as points, excelling at
similarity but struggling with higher-level reasoning and asymmetric
relationships. We introduce a novel paradigm: embedding concepts as linear
subspaces. This framework inherently models generality via subspace
dimensionality and hierarchy through subspace inclusion. It naturally supports
set-theoretic operations like intersection (conjunction), linear sum
(disjunction) and orthogonal complements (negations), aligning with classical
formal semantics. To enable differentiable learning, we propose a smooth
relaxation of orthogonal projection operators, allowing for the learning of
both subspace orientation and dimension. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
results in reconstruction and link prediction on WordNet. Furthermore, on
natural language inference benchmarks, our subspace embeddings surpass
bi-encoder baselines, offering an interpretable formulation of entailment that
is both geometrically grounded and amenable to logical operations.

Motivation: 传统方法求解非线性偏微分方程存在计算效率低、精度不足的问题，需要结合神经网络强大的逼近能力和符号计算的高精度优势来提升求解效果。

Conclusion: AENNM为求解非线性偏微分方程提供了新的方法论框架，在科学和工程领域具有广泛的应用前景，成功建立了微分方程理论与深度学习之间的数学联系。

Abstract: In this study, we firstly propose an auxiliary equation neural networks
method (AENNM), an innovative analytical method that integrates neural networks
(NNs) models with the auxiliary equation method to obtain exact solutions of
nonlinear partial differential equations (NLPDEs). A key novelty of this method
is the introduction of a novel activation function derived from the solutions
of the Riccati equation, establishing a new mathematical link between
differential equations theory and deep learning. By combining the strong
approximation capability of NNs with the high precision of symbolic
computation, AENNM significantly enhances computational efficiency and
accuracy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the AENNM in solving NLPDEs,
three numerical examples are investigated, including the nonlinear evolution
equation, the Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers equation, and the (2+1)-dimensional
Boussinesq equation. Furthermore, some new trial functions are constructed by
setting specific activation functions within the "2-2-2-1" and "3-2-2-1" NNs
models. By embedding the auxiliary equation method into the NNs framework, we
derive previously unreported solutions. The exact analytical solutions are
expressed in terms of hyperbolic functions, trigonometric functions, and
rational functions. Finally, three-dimensional plots, contour plots, and
density plots are presented to illustrate the dynamic characteristics of the
obtained solutions. This research provides a novel methodological framework for
addressing NLPDEs, with broad applicability across scientific and engineering
fields.

Motivation: 传统深度学习优化方法平等对待所有训练样本，而分布鲁棒优化(DRO)虽然能自适应分配样本重要性权重，但与当前DL实践存在显著差距，需要适应随机梯度处理能力并支持样本组权重分配。

Method: 提出ALSO算法，针对改进的DRO目标设计自适应算法，能够处理样本组的权重分配，并证明了在非凸目标（典型DL模型）上的收敛性。

Result: 在从表格DL到分割学习等多样化深度学习任务中的实证评估表明，ALSO在性能上优于传统优化器和现有DRO方法。

Conclusion: ALSO成功弥合了DRO与当前DL实践之间的差距，提供了一种既能处理随机梯度又能支持样本组权重分配的有效优化方法。

Abstract: While traditional Deep Learning (DL) optimization methods treat all training
samples equally, Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) adaptively assigns
importance weights to different samples. However, a significant gap exists
between DRO and current DL practices. Modern DL optimizers require adaptivity
and the ability to handle stochastic gradients, as these methods demonstrate
superior performance. Additionally, for practical applications, a method should
allow weight assignment not only to individual samples, but also to groups of
objects (for example, all samples of the same class). This paper aims to bridge
this gap by introducing ALSO $\unicode{x2013}$ Adaptive Loss Scaling Optimizer
$\unicode{x2013}$ an adaptive algorithm for a modified DRO objective that can
handle weight assignment to sample groups. We prove the convergence of our
proposed algorithm for non-convex objectives, which is the typical case for DL
models. Empirical evaluation across diverse Deep Learning tasks, from Tabular
DL to Split Learning tasks, demonstrates that ALSO outperforms both traditional
optimizers and existing DRO methods.

Abstract: Lyapunov functions are fundamental to establishing the stability of Markovian
models, yet their construction typically demands substantial creativity and
analytical effort. In this paper, we show that deep learning can automate this
process by training neural networks to satisfy integral equations derived from
first-transition analysis. Beyond stability analysis, our approach can be
adapted to solve Poisson's equation and estimate stationary distributions.
While neural networks are inherently function approximators on compact domains,
it turns out that our approach remains effective when applied to Markov chains
on non-compact state spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this
methodology through several examples from queueing theory and beyond.

Conclusion: 小模型能够可靠地支撑大模型，释放其潜在能力，同时避免强教师可能引入的错误提示，为高效安全的LLM提示优化提供了可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Effective prompt engineering remains a challenging task for many
applications. We introduce Weak-to-Strong Transfer (WST), an automatic prompt
engineering framework where a small "Teacher" model generates instructions that
enhance the performance of a much larger "Student" model. Unlike prior work,
WST requires only a weak teacher, making it efficient and broadly applicable in
settings where large models are closed-source or difficult to fine-tune. Using
reinforcement learning, the Teacher Model's instructions are iteratively
improved based on the Student Model's outcomes, yielding substantial gains
across reasoning (MATH-500, GSM8K) and alignment (HH-RLHF) benchmarks - 98% on
MATH-500 and 134% on HH-RLHF - and surpassing baselines such as GPT-4o-mini and
Llama-70B. These results demonstrate that small models can reliably scaffold
larger ones, unlocking latent capabilities while avoiding misleading prompts
that stronger teachers may introduce, establishing WST as a scalable solution
for efficient and safe LLM prompt refinement.

Abstract: Reasoning is a core capability of large language models, yet understanding
how they learn and perform multi-step reasoning remains an open problem. In
this study, we explore how different architectures and training methods affect
model multi-step reasoning capabilities within a cellular automata framework.
By training on state sequences generated with random Boolean functions for
random initial conditions to exclude memorization, we demonstrate that most
neural architectures learn to abstract the underlying rules. While models
achieve high accuracy in next-state prediction, their performance declines
sharply if multi-step reasoning is required. We confirm that increasing model
depth plays a crucial role for sequential computations. We demonstrate that an
extension of the effective model depth with recurrence, memory, and test-time
compute scaling substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: FAIRWELL方法能有效学习公平的多模态表示，在保持分类性能的同时显著提升公平性

Abstract: Early efforts on leveraging self-supervised learning (SSL) to improve machine
learning (ML) fairness has proven promising. However, such an approach has yet
to be explored within a multimodal context. Prior work has shown that, within a
multimodal setting, different modalities contain modality-unique information
that can complement information of other modalities. Leveraging on this, we
propose a novel subject-level loss function to learn fairer representations via
the following three mechanisms, adapting the variance-invariance-covariance
regularization (VICReg) method: (i) the variance term, which reduces reliance
on the protected attribute as a trivial solution; (ii) the invariance term,
which ensures consistent predictions for similar individuals; and (iii) the
covariance term, which minimizes correlational dependence on the protected
attribute. Consequently, our loss function, coined as FAIRWELL, aims to obtain
subject-independent representations, enforcing fairness in multimodal
prediction tasks. We evaluate our method on three challenging real-world
heterogeneous healthcare datasets (i.e. D-Vlog, MIMIC and MODMA) which contain
different modalities of varying length and different prediction tasks. Our
findings indicate that our framework improves overall fairness performance with
minimal reduction in classification performance and significantly improves on
the performance-fairness Pareto frontier.

Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of integrated circuit design have led to
increased challenges in Electronic Design Automation (EDA). Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach to assist EDA design as
circuits can be naturally represented as graphs. While GNNs offer a foundation
for circuit analysis, they often fail to capture the full complexity of EDA
designs. Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) can better interpret EDA
circuit graphs as they capture both topological relationships and geometric
features. However, the improved representation capability comes at the cost of
even higher computational complexity and processing cost due to their serial
module-wise message-passing scheme, creating a significant performance
bottleneck. In this paper, we propose DR-CircuitGNN, a fast GPU kernel design
by leveraging row-wise sparsity-aware Dynamic-ReLU and optimizing SpMM kernels
during heterogeneous message-passing to accelerate HGNNs training on
EDA-related circuit graph datasets. To further enhance performance, we propose
a parallel optimization strategy that maximizes CPU-GPU concurrency by
concurrently processing independent subgraphs using multi-threaded CPU
initialization and GPU kernel execution via multiple cudaStreams. Our
experiments show that on three representative CircuitNet designs (small,
medium, large), the proposed method can achieve up to 3.51x and 4.09x speedup
compared to the SOTA for forward and backward propagation, respectively. On
full-size CircuitNet and sampled Mini-CircuitNet, our parallel design enables
up to 2.71x speed up over the official DGL implementation cuSPARSE with
negligible impact on correlation scores and error rates.

Abstract: Inferring temporal interaction graphs and higher-order structure from neural
signals is a key problem in building generative models for systems
neuroscience. Foundation models for large-scale neural data represent shared
latent structures of neural signals. However, extracting interpretable latent
graph representations in foundation models remains challenging and unsolved.
Here we explore latent graph learning in generative models of neural signals.
By testing against numerical simulations of neural circuits with known
ground-truth connectivity, we evaluate several hypotheses for explaining
learned model weights. We discover modest alignment between extracted network
representations and the underlying directed graphs and strong alignment in the
co-input graph representations. These findings motivate paths towards
incorporating graph-based geometric constraints in the construction of
large-scale foundation models for neural data.

Abstract: Quantization offers a practical solution to deploy LLMs in
resource-constraint environments. However, its impact on internal
representations remains understudied, raising questions about the reliability
of quantized models. In this study, we employ a range of interpretability
techniques to investigate how quantization affects model and neuron behavior.
We analyze multiple LLMs under 4-bit and 8-bit quantization. Our findings
reveal that the impact of quantization on model calibration is generally minor.
Analysis of neuron activations indicates that the number of dead neurons, i.e.,
those with activation values close to 0 across the dataset, remains consistent
regardless of quantization. In terms of neuron contribution to predictions, we
observe that smaller full precision models exhibit fewer salient neurons,
whereas larger models tend to have more, with the exception of Llama-2-7B. The
effect of quantization on neuron redundancy varies across models. Overall, our
findings suggest that effect of quantization may vary by model and tasks,
however, we did not observe any drastic change which may discourage the use of
quantization as a reliable model compression technique.

Abstract: Regression under uncertainty is fundamental across science and engineering.
We present an Anchored Mixture of Experts (Anchor-MoE), a model that handles
both probabilistic and point regression. For simplicity, we use a tuned
gradient-boosting model to furnish the anchor mean; however, any off-the-shelf
point regressor can serve as the anchor. The anchor prediction is projected
into a latent space, where a learnable metric-window kernel scores locality and
a soft router dispatches each sample to a small set of mixture-density-network
experts; the experts produce a heteroscedastic correction and predictive
variance. We train by minimizing negative log-likelihood, and on a disjoint
calibration split fit a post-hoc linear map on predicted means to improve point
accuracy. On the theory side, assuming a H\"older smooth regression function of
order~$\alpha$ and fixed Lipschitz partition-of-unity weights with bounded
overlap, we show that Anchor-MoE attains the minimax-optimal $L^2$ risk rate
$O\!\big(N^{-2\alpha/(2\alpha+d)}\big)$. In addition, the CRPS test
generalization gap scales as
$\widetilde{O}\!\Big(\sqrt{(\log(Mh)+P+K)/N}\Big)$; it is logarithmic in $Mh$
and scales as the square root in $P$ and $K$. Under bounded-overlap routing,
$K$ can be replaced by $k$, and any dependence on a latent dimension is
absorbed into $P$. Under uniformly bounded means and variances, an analogous
$\widetilde{O}\!\big(\sqrt{(\log(Mh)+P+K)/N}\big)$ scaling holds for the test
NLL up to constants. Empirically, across standard UCI regressions, Anchor-MoE
consistently matches or surpasses the strong NGBoost baseline in RMSE and NLL;
on several datasets it achieves new state-of-the-art probabilistic regression
results on our benchmark suite. Code is available at

Conclusion: UPN提供了一种连续深度的建模框架，能够自适应输入复杂度，提供原则性的不确定性量化，并自然处理不规则采样观测，在多个应用领域展现出有效性。

Abstract: This paper introduces Uncertainty Propagation Network (UPN), a novel family
of neural differential equations that naturally incorporate uncertainty
quantification into continuous-time modeling. Unlike existing neural ODEs that
predict only state trajectories, UPN simultaneously model both state evolution
and its associated uncertainty by parameterizing coupled differential equations
for mean and covariance dynamics. The architecture efficiently propagates
uncertainty through nonlinear dynamics without discretization artifacts by
solving coupled ODEs for state and covariance evolution while enabling
state-dependent, learnable process noise. The continuous-depth formulation
adapts its evaluation strategy to each input's complexity, provides principled
uncertainty quantification, and handles irregularly-sampled observations
naturally. Experimental results demonstrate UPN's effectiveness across multiple
domains: continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with uncertainty quantification,
time-series forecasting with well-calibrated confidence intervals, and robust
trajectory prediction in both stable and chaotic dynamical systems.

Abstract: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) hold a key position in machine
learning on graphs, but they struggle with unintended behaviors, such as
over-smoothing and over-squashing, due to irregular data structures. The
observation and formulation of these limitations have become foundational in
constructing more informative graph representations. In this paper, we delve
into the limitations of MPNNs, focusing on aspects that have previously been
overlooked. Our observations reveal that even within a single layer, the
information specific to an individual node can become significantly diluted. To
delve into this phenomenon in depth, we present the concept of Over-dilution
and formulate it with two dilution factors: intra-node dilution for
attribute-level and inter-node dilution for node-level representations. We also
introduce a transformer-based solution that alleviates over-dilution and
complements existing node embedding methods like MPNNs. Our findings provide
new insights and contribute to the development of informative representations.

Abstract: Modern manufacturing relies heavily on fusion welding processes, including
gas metal arc welding (GMAW). Despite significant advances in machine
learning-based quality prediction, current models exhibit critical limitations
when confronted with the inherent distribution shifts that occur in dynamic
manufacturing environments. In this work, we extend the VQ-VAE Transformer
architecture - previously demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in weld
quality prediction - by leveraging its autoregressive loss as a reliable
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection mechanism. Our approach exhibits superior
performance compared to conventional reconstruction methods, embedding
error-based techniques, and other established baselines. By integrating OOD
detection with continual learning strategies, we optimize model adaptation,
triggering updates only when necessary and thereby minimizing costly labeling
requirements. We introduce a novel quantitative metric that simultaneously
evaluates OOD detection capability while interpreting in-distribution
performance. Experimental validation in real-world welding scenarios
demonstrates that our framework effectively maintains robust quality prediction
capabilities across significant distribution shifts, addressing critical
challenges in dynamic manufacturing environments where process parameters
frequently change. This research makes a substantial contribution to applied
artificial intelligence by providing an explainable and at the same time
adaptive solution for quality assurance in dynamic manufacturing processes - a
crucial step towards robust, practical AI systems in the industrial
environment.

Abstract: Industrial chain plays an increasingly important role in the sustainable
development of national economy. However, as a typical complex network,
data-driven deep learning is still in its infancy in describing and analyzing
the resilience of complex networks, and its core is the lack of a theoretical
framework to describe the system dynamics. In this paper, we propose a
physically informative neural symbolic approach to describe the evolutionary
dynamics of complex networks for resilient prediction. The core idea is to
learn the dynamics of the activity state of physical entities and integrate it
into the multi-layer spatiotemporal co-evolution network, and use the physical
information method to realize the joint learning of physical symbol dynamics
and spatiotemporal co-evolution topology, so as to predict the industrial chain
resilience. The experimental results show that the model can obtain better
results and predict the elasticity of the industry chain more accurately and
effectively, which has certain practical significance for the development of
the industry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法要么计算成本高但可解释性强，要么数据驱动但可解释性差。需要一种既能保持计算效率又能提供可解释敏感性信息的方法。

Method: 基于强对比展开(SCE)形式，提出NCE架构，从结构-属性数据中学习替代PDE核函数，仅需宏观属性测量而不需要PDE解场信息。

Result: 在静态传导和电磁波传播案例中，NCE模型显示出准确且具有洞察力的敏感性信息，对材料设计有用。

Conclusion: NCE方法为复合材料有效属性预测提供了一种既成本效益高又具有良好可解释性的解决方案，特别适用于材料开发场景。

Abstract: Effective properties of composite materials are defined as the ensemble
average of property-specific PDE solutions over the underlying microstructure
distributions. Traditionally, predicting such properties can be done by solving
PDEs derived from microstructure samples or building data-driven models that
directly map microstructure samples to properties. The former has a higher
running cost, but provides explainable sensitivity information that may guide
material design; the latter could be more cost-effective if the data overhead
is amortized, but its learned sensitivities are often less explainable. With a
focus on properties governed by linear self-adjoint PDEs (e.g., Laplace,
Helmholtz, and Maxwell curl-curl) defined on bi-phase microstructures, we
propose a structure-property model that is both cost-effective and explainable.
Our method is built on top of the strong contrast expansion (SCE) formalism,
which analytically maps $N$-point correlations of an unbounded random field to
its effective properties. Since real-world material samples have finite sizes
and analytical PDE kernels are not always available, we propose Neural Contrast
Expansion (NCE), an SCE-inspired architecture to learn surrogate PDE kernels
from structure-property data. For static conduction and electromagnetic wave
propagation cases, we show that NCE models reveal accurate and insightful
sensitivity information useful for material design. Compared with other PDE
kernel learning methods, our method does not require measurements about the PDE
solution fields, but rather only requires macroscopic property measurements
that are more accessible in material development contexts.

Abstract: Map-to-map matching is a critical task for aligning spatial data across
heterogeneous sources, yet it remains challenging due to the lack of ground
truth correspondences, sparse node features, and scalability demands. In this
paper, we propose an unsupervised graph-based framework that addresses these
challenges through three key innovations. First, our method is an unsupervised
learning approach that requires no training data, which is crucial for
large-scale map data where obtaining labeled training samples is challenging.
Second, we introduce pseudo coordinates that capture the relative spatial
layout of nodes within each map, which enhances feature discriminability and
enables scale-invariant learning. Third, we design an mechanism to adaptively
balance feature and geometric similarity, as well as a geometric-consistent
loss function, ensuring robustness to noisy or incomplete coordinate data. At
the implementation level, to handle large-scale maps, we develop a tile-based
post-processing pipeline with overlapping regions and majority voting, which
enables parallel processing while preserving boundary coherence. Experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy in matching tasks, surpassing existing methods by a large margin,
particularly in high-noise and large-scale scenarios. Our framework provides a
scalable and practical solution for map alignment, offering a robust and
efficient alternative to traditional approaches.

Motivation: 神经网络湍流闭合模型缺乏不确定性量化能力，特别是在训练数据范围外的输入情况下，这限制了其广泛应用

Method: 使用已发布的代数湍流闭合模型，比较深度集成(DE)、蒙特卡洛dropout(MCD)、随机变分推理(SVI)和高斯过程(GP)四种方法在不确定性量化方面的性能

Result: 在训练区域内GP精度最高(RMSE=2.14e-5)，DE次之(4.59e-4)；在训练区域外GP和DE性能相近；DE在负对数似然指标上表现最佳；GP计算成本显著高于神经网络方法

Conclusion: 深度集成方法在保持相对鲁棒性和直观不确定性估计的同时，计算效率优于高斯过程，是湍流闭合不确定性量化的实用选择

Abstract: Neural-Network (NN) based turbulence closures have been developed for being
used as pre-trained surrogates for traditional turbulence closures, with the
aim to increase computational efficiency and prediction accuracy of CFD
simulations. The bottleneck to the widespread adaptation of these ML-based
closures is the relative lack of uncertainty quantification (UQ) for these
models. Especially, quantifying uncertainties associated with out-of-training
inputs, that is when the ML-based turbulence closures are queried on inputs
outside their training data regime. In the current paper, a published algebraic
turbulence closure1 has been utilized to compare the quality of epistemic UQ
between three NN-based methods and Gaussian Process (GP). The three NN-based
methods explored are Deep Ensembles (DE), Monte-Carlo Dropout (MCD), and
Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI). In the in-training results, we find the
exact GP performs the best in accuracy with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of
$2.14 \cdot 10^{-5}$ followed by the DE with an RMSE of $4.59 \cdot 10^{-4}$.
Next, the paper discusses the performance of the four methods for quantifying
out-of-training uncertainties. For performance, the Exact GP yet again is the
best in performance, but has similar performance to the DE in the
out-of-training regions. In UQ accuracy for the out-of-training case, SVI and
DE hold the best miscalibration error for one of the cases. However, the DE
performs the best in Negative Log-Likelihood for both out-of-training cases. We
observe that for the current problem, in terms of accuracy GP > DE > SV I >
MCD. The DE results are relatively robust and provide intuitive UQ estimates,
despite performing naive ensembling. In terms of computational cost, the GP is
significantly higher than the NN-based methods with a $O(n^3)$ computational
complexity for each training step

TL;DR: Tri-Accel是一个统一的优化框架，通过协同适配三种加速策略（精度自适应更新、稀疏二阶信号、内存弹性批处理缩放）来减少神经网络训练的时间和内存消耗，同时提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在优化成本方面越来越受到GPU内存和计算时间的瓶颈限制，现有的加速技术通常单独使用，缺乏统一的协同优化方案。

Method: 提出Tri-Accel框架，包含：(1)基于曲率和梯度方差动态分配混合精度级别的精度自适应更新；(2)利用Hessian/Fisher稀疏模式指导精度和步长决策的稀疏二阶信号；(3)根据VRAM可用性实时调整批处理大小的内存弹性批处理缩放。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上使用ResNet-18和EfficientNet-B0，训练时间减少9.9%，内存使用降低13.3%，准确率比FP32基线提高1.1个百分点。内存占用从0.35GB降至0.31GB，保持78.1%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了算法自适应性和硬件感知相结合如何提高资源受限环境中的可扩展性，为边缘设备和成本敏感的云部署提供更高效的神经网络训练方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly bottlenecked by the cost of
optimization, both in terms of GPU memory and compute time. Existing
acceleration techniques, such as mixed precision, second-order methods, and
batch size scaling, are typically used in isolation. We present Tri-Accel, a
unified optimization framework that co-adapts three acceleration strategies
along with adaptive parameters during training: (1) Precision-Adaptive Updates
that dynamically assign mixed-precision levels to layers based on curvature and
gradient variance; (2) Sparse Second-Order Signals that exploit Hessian/Fisher
sparsity patterns to guide precision and step size decisions; and (3)
Memory-Elastic Batch Scaling that adjusts batch size in real time according to
VRAM availability. On CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0, Tri-Accel
achieves up to 9.9% reduction in training time and 13.3% lower memory usage,
while improving accuracy by +1.1 percentage points over FP32 baselines. Tested
on CIFAR-10/100, our approach demonstrates adaptive learning behavior, with
efficiency gradually improving over the course of training as the system learns
to allocate resources more effectively. Compared to static mixed-precision
training, Tri-Accel maintains 78.1% accuracy while reducing memory footprint
from 0.35GB to 0.31GB on standard hardware. The framework is implemented with
custom Triton kernels, whose hardware-aware adaptation enables automatic
optimization without manual hyperparameter tuning, making it practical for
deployment across diverse computational environments. This work demonstrates
how algorithmic adaptivity and hardware awareness can be combined to improve
scalability in resource-constrained settings, paving the way for more efficient
neural network training on edge devices and cost-sensitive cloud deployments.

Abstract: The growing adoption of home banking systems has heightened the risk of
cyberfraud, necessitating fraud detection mechanisms that are not only accurate
but also fair and explainable. While AI models have shown promise in this
domain, they face key limitations, including computational inefficiency, the
interpretability challenges of spiking neural networks (SNNs), and the
complexity and convergence instability of hyper-heuristic reinforcement
learning (RL)-based hyperparameter optimization. To address these issues, we
propose a novel framework that integrates a Cortical Spiking Network with
Population Coding (CSNPC) and a Reinforcement-Guided Hyper-Heuristic Optimizer
for Spiking Systems (RHOSS). The CSNPC, a biologically inspired SNN, employs
population coding for robust classification, while RHOSS uses Q-learning to
dynamically select low-level heuristics for hyperparameter optimization under
fairness and recall constraints. Embedded within the Modular Supervisory
Framework for Spiking Network Training and Interpretation (MoSSTI), the system
incorporates explainable AI (XAI) techniques, specifically, saliency-based
attribution and spike activity profiling, to increase transparency. Evaluated
on the Bank Account Fraud (BAF) dataset suite, our model achieves a $90.8\%$
recall at a strict $5\%$ false positive rate (FPR), outperforming
state-of-the-art spiking and non-spiking models while maintaining over $98\%$
predictive equality across key demographic attributes. The explainability
module further confirms that saliency attributions align with spiking dynamics,
validating interpretability. These results demonstrate the potential of
combining population-coded SNNs with reinforcement-guided hyper-heuristics for
fair, transparent, and high-performance fraud detection in real-world financial
applications.

Motivation: 虽然Transformer模型被认为在高维隐藏空间中运行，但注意力输出实际上存在于低维子空间，这种低秩结构是稀疏字典学习中死亡特征问题的根本原因。

Method: 提出子空间约束训练方法，将特征方向初始化到激活的活跃子空间中，适用于注意力输出稀疏自编码器和其他稀疏字典学习方法。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了注意力几何结构的新见解，并为改进大型语言模型中的稀疏字典学习提供了实用工具。

Abstract: While transformer models are widely believed to operate in high-dimensional
hidden spaces, we show that attention outputs are confined to a surprisingly
low-dimensional subspace, where about 60\% of the directions account for 99\%
of the variance--a phenomenon that is induced by the attention output
projection matrix and consistently observed across diverse model families and
datasets. Critically, we find this low-rank structure as a fundamental cause of
the prevalent dead feature problem in sparse dictionary learning, where it
creates a mismatch between randomly initialized features and the intrinsic
geometry of the activation space. Building on this insight, we propose a
subspace-constrained training method for sparse autoencoders (SAEs),
initializing feature directions into the active subspace of activations. Our
approach reduces dead features from 87\% to below 1\% in Attention Output SAEs
with 1M features, and can further extend to other sparse dictionary learning
methods. Our findings provide both new insights into the geometry of attention
and practical tools for improving sparse dictionary learning in large language
models.

Abstract: Handling data staleness remains a significant challenge in federated learning
with highly time-sensitive tasks, where data is generated continuously and data
staleness largely affects model performance. Although recent works attempt to
optimize data staleness by determining local data update frequency or client
selection strategy, none of them explore taking both data staleness and data
volume into consideration. In this paper, we propose DUFL(Data Updating in
Federated Learning), an incentive mechanism featuring an innovative local data
update scheme manipulated by three knobs: the server's payment, outdated data
conservation rate, and clients' fresh data collection volume, to coordinate
staleness and volume of local data for best utilities. To this end, we
introduce a novel metric called DoS(the Degree of Staleness) to quantify data
staleness and conduct a theoretic analysis illustrating the quantitative
relationship between DoS and model performance. We model DUFL as a two-stage
Stackelberg game with dynamic constraint, deriving the optimal local data
update strategy for each client in closed-form and the approximately optimal
strategy for the server. Experimental results on real-world datasets
demonstrate the significant performance of our approach.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art results in generative
modelling but remain computationally intensive at inference time, often
requiring thousands of discretization steps. To this end, we propose Sig-DEG
(Signature-based Differential Equation Generator), a novel generator for
distilling pre-trained diffusion models, which can universally approximate the
backward diffusion process at a coarse temporal resolution. Inspired by
high-order approximations of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), Sig-DEG
leverages partial signatures to efficiently summarize Brownian motion over
sub-intervals and adopts a recurrent structure to enable accurate global
approximation of the SDE solution. Distillation is formulated as a supervised
learning task, where Sig-DEG is trained to match the outputs of a
fine-resolution diffusion model on a coarse time grid. During inference,
Sig-DEG enables fast generation, as the partial signature terms can be
simulated exactly without requiring fine-grained Brownian paths. Experiments
demonstrate that Sig-DEG achieves competitive generation quality while reducing
the number of inference steps by an order of magnitude. Our results highlight
the effectiveness of signature-based approximations for efficient generative
modeling.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在强化学习中面临探索困境：高质量样本的获取受限于模型本身的能力，形成'无法探索就无法学习'的恶性循环。

Method: 提出RuscaRL框架：1）在生成阶段使用清单式评分标准作为外部指导，引导多样化高质量响应；2）在训练阶段使用评分标准作为参考获得可靠的LLM-as-a-Judge评分，实现有效强化学习。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct在HealthBench-500上从23.6提升到50.3，超越GPT-4.1；Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct达到61.1，超越包括OpenAI-o3在内的领先模型。

Conclusion: RuscaRL成功突破了LLM推理的探索边界，通过教学支架框架有效提升了模型在通用推理任务上的性能，为强化学习在大语言模型中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have underscored the
potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to facilitate the emergence of
reasoning capabilities. Despite the encouraging results, a fundamental dilemma
persists as RL improvement relies on learning from high-quality samples, yet
the exploration for such samples remains bounded by the inherent limitations of
LLMs. This, in effect, creates an undesirable cycle in which what cannot be
explored cannot be learned. In this work, we propose Rubric-Scaffolded
Reinforcement Learning (RuscaRL), a novel instructional scaffolding framework
designed to break the exploration bottleneck for general LLM reasoning.
Specifically, RuscaRL introduces checklist-style rubrics as (1) explicit
scaffolding for exploration during rollout generation, where different rubrics
are provided as external guidance within task instructions to steer diverse
high-quality responses. This guidance is gradually decayed over time,
encouraging the model to internalize the underlying reasoning patterns; (2)
verifiable rewards for exploitation during model training, where we can obtain
robust LLM-as-a-Judge scores using rubrics as references, enabling effective RL
on general reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed RuscaRL across various benchmarks, effectively expanding
reasoning boundaries under the best-of-N evaluation. Notably, RuscaRL
significantly boosts Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct from 23.6 to 50.3 on HealthBench-500,
surpassing GPT-4.1. Furthermore, our fine-tuned variant on
Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct achieves 61.1 on HealthBench-500, outperforming leading
LLMs including OpenAI-o3.

*Manan Gupta,Dhruv Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Polysemanticity Index (PSI)指标，用于量化神经网络中多义神经元的语义聚类程度，发现深层网络比浅层网络具有更高的多义性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络中存在多义神经元，这些神经元对多个有时不相关的特征做出响应，这给机制可解释性带来了挑战，需要一种量化方法来识别和研究这些多义单元。

Method: 开发了PSI指标，包含三个校准组件：几何聚类质量(S)、与标注类别的对齐度(Q)以及通过CLIP的开放词汇语义区分度(D)。在预训练的ResNet-50上使用Tiny-ImageNet图像进行评估，并进行鲁棒性检查和因果干预验证。

Result: PSI成功识别出激活集可分解为连贯、可命名原型的神经元，发现深层网络比浅层网络表现出显著更高的多义性。对齐补丁替换比非对齐、随机、位置洗牌或消融控制更能显著增加目标神经元激活。

Conclusion: PSI提供了一个原则性和实用的工具，用于发现、量化和研究神经网络中的多义单元，有助于提升神经网络的可解释性研究。

Abstract: Neural networks often contain polysemantic neurons that respond to multiple,
sometimes unrelated, features, complicating mechanistic interpretability. We
introduce the Polysemanticity Index (PSI), a null-calibrated metric that
quantifies when a neuron's top activations decompose into semantically distinct
clusters. PSI multiplies three independently calibrated components: geometric
cluster quality (S), alignment to labeled categories (Q), and open-vocabulary
semantic distinctness via CLIP (D). On a pretrained ResNet-50 evaluated with
Tiny-ImageNet images, PSI identifies neurons whose activation sets split into
coherent, nameable prototypes, and reveals strong depth trends: later layers
exhibit substantially higher PSI than earlier layers. We validate our approach
with robustness checks (varying hyperparameters, random seeds, and
cross-encoder text heads), breadth analyses (comparing class-only vs.
open-vocabulary concepts), and causal patch-swap interventions. In particular,
aligned patch replacements increase target-neuron activation significantly more
than non-aligned, random, shuffled-position, or ablate-elsewhere controls. PSI
thus offers a principled and practical lever for discovering, quantifying, and
studying polysemantic units in neural networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过激活导向技术研究LLM反思机制的内在机理，发现不同反思指令在激活空间中存在明确分层，可通过激活干预直接控制反思行为，且抑制反思比激发更容易。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注反思提示策略或强化学习目标，但对反思的内在机制探索不足。本文旨在从模型激活的潜在方向角度深入理解反思机制。

Method: 提出基于激活导向的方法论，构建不同反思级别（无反思、内在反思、触发反思）之间的导向向量，通过激活干预实验验证反思的可控性。

Result: 实验发现：(1)可系统识别新的反思诱导指令；(2)可通过激活干预直接增强或抑制反思行为；(3)抑制反思比激发更容易。在GSM8k-adv数据集上验证了反思级别的明确分层。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM反思机制的可控性，既为反思增强防御提供了机会，也指出了对抗性抑制反思的风险，为理解LLM反思推理机制开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Reflection, the ability of large language models (LLMs) to evaluate and
revise their own reasoning, has been widely used to improve performance on
complex reasoning tasks. Yet, most prior work emphasizes designing reflective
prompting strategies or reinforcement learning objectives, leaving the inner
mechanisms of reflection underexplored. In this paper, we investigate
reflection through the lens of latent directions in model activations. We
propose a methodology based on activation steering to characterize how
instructions with different reflective intentions: no reflection, intrinsic
reflection, and triggered reflection. By constructing steering vectors between
these reflection levels, we demonstrate that (1) new reflection-inducing
instructions can be systematically identified, (2) reflective behavior can be
directly enhanced or suppressed through activation interventions, and (3)
suppressing reflection is considerably easier than stimulating it. Experiments
on GSM8k-adv with Qwen2.5-3B and Gemma3-4B reveal clear stratification across
reflection levels, and steering interventions confirm the controllability of
reflection. Our findings highlight both opportunities (e.g.,
reflection-enhancing defenses) and risks (e.g., adversarial inhibition of
reflection in jailbreak attacks). This work opens a path toward mechanistic
understanding of reflective reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文研究具有长期预算约束的在线学习问题，提出了一种高效的一阶在线算法，在完全信息和bandit反馈设置下都能实现O(√T)的α-regret，同时资源消耗最多为O(B_T log T) + ˜O(√T)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在线学习中具有长期预算约束的问题，特别是在对抗性环境下处理近似凸函数（包括凸函数和常见非凸优化问题）的挑战。

Method: 提出一种高效的一阶在线算法，适用于完全信息和bandit反馈设置，能够处理α-近似凸函数类，包括DR-次模最大化、在线顶点覆盖和正则化相位恢复等问题。

Result: 算法保证O(√T)的α-regret，资源消耗最多为O(B_T log T) + ˜O(√T)，在bandit反馈设置下为Adversarial Bandits with Knapsacks问题提供了改进的解决方案，并证明了匹配的下界。

Conclusion: 该研究为具有长期预算约束的在线学习问题提供了紧致的算法保证，适用于广泛的近似凸函数类，在理论和实际应用上都具有重要意义。

Abstract: We study an online learning problem with long-term budget constraints in the
adversarial setting. In this problem, at each round $t$, the learner selects an
action from a convex decision set, after which the adversary reveals a cost
function $f_t$ and a resource consumption function $g_t$. The cost and
consumption functions are assumed to be $\alpha$-approximately convex - a broad
class that generalizes convexity and encompasses many common non-convex
optimization problems, including DR-submodular maximization, Online Vertex
Cover, and Regularized Phase Retrieval. The goal is to design an online
algorithm that minimizes cumulative cost over a horizon of length $T$ while
approximately satisfying a long-term budget constraint of $B_T$. We propose an
efficient first-order online algorithm that guarantees $O(\sqrt{T})$
$\alpha$-regret against the optimal fixed feasible benchmark while consuming at
most $O(B_T \log T)+ \tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ resources in both full-information
and bandit feedback settings. In the bandit feedback setting, our approach
yields an efficient solution for the $\texttt{Adversarial Bandits with
Knapsacks}$ problem with improved guarantees. We also prove matching lower
bounds, demonstrating the tightness of our results. Finally, we characterize
the class of $\alpha$-approximately convex functions and show that our results
apply to a broad family of problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文LLM推理的瓶颈在于KV缓存线性增长，需要研究压缩KV缓存的方法机制

Method: 通过实证分析CARTRIDGE key-value结构，提出key作为检索路由器、value负责压缩的理论，并设计SCI初始化方法

Result: 实验证明key向量在不同任务间可互换而性能损失很小，SCI能加速CARTRIDGE收敛

Conclusion: 揭示了CARTRIDGE工作机制，为后续优化和扩展奠定了基础

Abstract: A bottleneck for long-context LLM inference is the linearly growing KV cache.
Recent work has proposed CARTRIDGES, an approach which leverages offline
compute to train a much smaller KV cache than is typically required for a full
document (up to 40x less memory usage at inference time). In this paper, we
present the first mechanistic exploration of the learned CARTRIDGE key-value
cache structure. In particular, we propose that (1) CARTRIDGE keys act as
stable, shareable retrieval routers for the compressed corpora and (2) most of
the learned compression occurs within the CARTRIDGE value vectors. We present
empirical evidence of our routing theory across tasks, model families, and
model sizes; for example, we can ablate the learned CARTRIDGE key vectors
between tasks with little performance loss. Finally, we propose a slight
improvement in initialization called Sampled Chunk Initialization (SCI). We
suggest that SCI can lead to faster CARTRIDGE convergence than previously
demonstrated in the literature. Our findings lay the groundwork for broader
empirical study of CARTRIDGE training optimization which may be crucial for
further scaling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabResFlow是一种用于表格回归的归一化样条流模型，通过灵活的密度估计和不确定性建模，在多个基准数据集上超越了现有概率回归模型，并在推理速度上有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表格回归方法主要关注点估计，容易产生过度自信的预测，这在工业自动化等需要可信决策的场景中尤为关键。现有概率回归方法通常假设固定形状分布（如高斯分布），但现实世界中的目标分布可能非常复杂。

Method: TabResFlow包含三个核心组件：(1)每个数值特征的MLP编码器；(2)用于表达性特征提取的全连接ResNet主干网络；(3)基于条件样条的归一化流，用于灵活且可处理的密度估计。

Result: 在9个公共基准数据集上，TabResFlow在似然分数上持续超越现有概率回归模型，相比最强模型TreeFlow提升9.64%，推理速度比最强深度学习替代方案NodeFlow平均快5.6倍。在实际二手车价格预测任务中也表现出色。

Conclusion: TabResFlow通过创新的归一化样条流架构，有效解决了表格回归中的不确定性建模问题，在性能和效率方面都取得了显著改进，具有重要的工业应用价值。

Abstract: Tabular regression is a well-studied problem with numerous industrial
applications, yet most existing approaches focus on point estimation, often
leading to overconfident predictions. This issue is particularly critical in
industrial automation, where trustworthy decision-making is essential.
Probabilistic regression models address this challenge by modeling prediction
uncertainty. However, many conventional methods assume a fixed-shape
distribution (typically Gaussian), and resort to estimating distribution
parameters. This assumption is often restrictive, as real-world target
distributions can be highly complex. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
TabResFlow, a Normalizing Spline Flow model designed specifically for
univariate tabular regression, where commonly used simple flow networks like
RealNVP and Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF) are unsuitable. TabResFlow
consists of three key components: (1) An MLP encoder for each numerical
feature. (2) A fully connected ResNet backbone for expressive feature
extraction. (3) A conditional spline-based normalizing flow for flexible and
tractable density estimation. We evaluate TabResFlow on nine public benchmark
datasets, demonstrating that it consistently surpasses existing probabilistic
regression models on likelihood scores. Our results demonstrate 9.64%
improvement compared to the strongest probabilistic regression model
(TreeFlow), and on average 5.6 times speed-up in inference time compared to the
strongest deep learning alternative (NodeFlow). Additionally, we validate the
practical applicability of TabResFlow in a real-world used car price prediction
task under selective regression. To measure performance in this setting, we
introduce a novel Area Under Risk Coverage (AURC) metric and show that
TabResFlow achieves superior results across this metric.

Motivation: 解决标准空间分割哈希方法依赖于二叉搜索树导致的指数增长和稀疏性问题，以及大规模生物医学数据分析的效率挑战。

Method: 提出了三种方法：1) ComBI（压缩倒排索引二叉树）进行快速近似最近邻搜索；2) GRAF（导向随机森林）分类器结合全局和局部分割；3) CRCS（编码子开关连续表示）深度学习框架将遗传变化嵌入数值向量。

Result: 在10亿样本数据集上，ComBI达到0.90精度，速度提升4-296倍；GRAF在115个数据集上显示竞争力或更优的准确性；CRCS在脑、肚腐、肝癌等多种癌症中验证了生存预测能力。

Conclusion: 这些方法为大规模数据分析和生物医学应用提供了高效、可扩展和可解释的工具集，在哈希搜索、分类预测和癌症生存分析方面都取得了显著成果。

Abstract: This thesis develops computational methods in similarity-preserving hashing,
classification, and cancer genomics. Standard space partitioning-based hashing
relies on Binary Search Trees (BSTs), but their exponential growth and sparsity
hinder efficiency. To overcome this, we introduce Compressed BST of Inverted
hash tables (ComBI), which enables fast approximate nearest-neighbor search
with reduced memory. On datasets of up to one billion samples, ComBI achieves
0.90 precision with 4X-296X speed-ups over Multi-Index Hashing, and also
outperforms Cellfishing.jl on single-cell RNA-seq searches with 2X-13X gains.
Building on hashing structures, we propose Guided Random Forest (GRAF), a
tree-based ensemble classifier that integrates global and local partitioning,
bridging decision trees and boosting while reducing generalization error.
Across 115 datasets, GRAF delivers competitive or superior accuracy, and its
unsupervised variant (uGRAF) supports guided hashing and importance sampling.
We show that GRAF and ComBI can be used to estimate per-sample classifiability,
which enables scalable prediction of cancer patient survival. To address
challenges in interpreting mutations, we introduce Continuous Representation of
Codon Switches (CRCS), a deep learning framework that embeds genetic changes
into numerical vectors. CRCS allows identification of somatic mutations without
matched normals, discovery of driver genes, and scoring of tumor mutations,
with survival prediction validated in bladder, liver, and brain cancers.
Together, these methods provide efficient, scalable, and interpretable tools
for large-scale data analysis and biomedical applications.

results reveal that CNN-based approaches, especially the multiple-branch model,
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to traditional methods,
particularly under challenging operational conditions. These findings highlight
the potential of deep learning techniques to enhance railway safety and
operational efficiency by more effectively capturing intricate patterns in

Conclusion: 该方法具有通用性，可应用于任何现有GNN架构，成功解决了GNN预测校准和可解释性问题

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools on graph data. However, their
predictions are mis-calibrated and lack interpretability, limiting their
adoption in critical applications. To address this issue, we propose a new
uncertainty-aware and interpretable graph classification model that combines
graph functional neural process and graph generative model. The core of our
method is to assume a set of latent rationales which can be mapped to a
probabilistic embedding space; the predictive distribution of the classifier is
conditioned on such rationale embeddings by learning a stochastic correlation
matrix. The graph generator serves to decode the graph structure of the
rationales from the embedding space for model interpretability. For efficient
model training, we adopt an alternating optimization procedure which mimics the
well known Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed method is
general and can be applied to any existing GNN architecture. Extensive
experiments on five graph classification datasets demonstrate that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both uncertainty
quantification and GNN interpretability. We also conduct case studies to show
that the decoded rationale structure can provide meaningful explanations.

Motivation: 分布式学习面临拜占庭故障和高通信成本的双重挑战，现有方法在结合通信压缩和拜占庭鲁棒聚合时存在性能下降问题，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出了RoSDHB算法，集成经典Polyak动量和新的协调压缩机制，仅假设诚实工作者平均损失函数的Lipschitz平滑性。

Result: 在标准(G,B)梯度差异异构模型下，RoSDHB性能与Byz-DASHA-PAGE相当，但在基准图像分类任务中实现了强鲁棒性和显著通信节省。

Conclusion: RoSDHB算法在减少假设条件的同时，有效解决了分布式学习中的拜占庭鲁棒性和通信效率问题，具有更好的实用性和性能表现。

Abstract: Distributed learning (DL) enables scalable model training over decentralized
data, but remains challenged by Byzantine faults and high communication costs.
While both issues have been studied extensively in isolation, their interaction
is less explored. Prior work shows that naively combining communication
compression with Byzantine-robust aggregation degrades resilience to faulty
nodes (or workers). The state-of-the-art algorithm, namely Byz-DASHA-PAGE [29],
makes use of the momentum variance reduction scheme to mitigate the detrimental
impact of compression noise on Byzantine-robustness. We propose a new
algorithm, named RoSDHB, that integrates the classic Polyak's momentum with a
new coordinated compression mechanism. We show that RoSDHB performs comparably
to Byz-DASHA-PAGE under the standard (G, B)-gradient dissimilarity
heterogeneity model, while it relies on fewer assumptions. In particular, we
only assume Lipschitz smoothness of the average loss function of the honest
workers, in contrast to [29]that additionally assumes a special smoothness of
bounded global Hessian variance. Empirical results on benchmark image
classification task show that RoSDHB achieves strong robustness with
significant communication savings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模MoE模型在边缘设备部署面临内存限制挑战，传统启发式专家缓存策略在模型参数扩展时难以维持高缓存命中率

Method: 将任务构建为多标签序列预测问题，使用从DeepSeek-V2-Chat-Lite MoE提取的6600万专家激活轨迹训练轻量级Transformer模型

Result: 在WebGLM-QA数据集上达到97.5%准确率和86.6% F1分数，当仅10%专家能放入GPU缓存时，缓存命中率从17%提升至72%

Conclusion: MoE-Beyond通过学习型预测器有效解决了MoE模型在资源受限环境中的内存管理问题，显著优于传统启发式方法

Abstract: The deployment of large-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models on edge devices
presents significant challenges due to memory constraints. While MoE
architectures enable efficient utilization of computational resources by
activating only a subset of experts per inference, they require careful memory
management to operate efficiently in resource-constrained environments.
Traditional heuristic-based expert caching strategies such as MoE-Infinity
struggle to maintain high cache hit rates as models parameters scale. In this
work, we introduce MoE-Beyond, a learning-based expert activation predictor
trained to predict expert activations during autoregressive decoding. By
framing the task as a multi-label sequence prediction problem, we train a
lightweight transformer model on 66 million expert activation traces extracted
from LDJnr-Puffin dataset [5] using DeepSeek-V2-Chat-Lite MoE. Our predictor
generalizes effectively across unseen prompts from WebGLM-QA dataset [6],
achieving 97.5% accuracy and an 86.6% F1-score. Simulation results show that
MoE-Beyond improves GPU cache hit rate from 17% to 72% when only 10% of experts
fit in GPU cache, outperforming heuristic baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在有限和优化问题中，通过策略性选择梯度查询（而非均匀随机查询）是否能提升随机梯度方法的性能，特别是瞬态收敛速度和稳态方差。

Method: 提出两种算法：1) OGQ（理想化算法）- 每次选择能带来最大期望改进的用户梯度；2) SGQ（实用算法）- 每次只查询一个用户但策略性选择，比SGD有更好的瞬态性能。理论分析基于平滑目标函数和Polyak-Lojasiewicz条件。

Result: 理论证明：在EI异质性假设下，OGQ能提升瞬态性能并降低稳态方差；SGQ在瞬态性能上优于SGD。数值实验验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 策略性梯度查询相比均匀查询能显著提升优化算法的性能，特别是在瞬态收敛阶段，提出的SGQ算法在实际应用中具有实用价值。

Abstract: This paper considers a finite-sum optimization problem under first-order
queries and investigates the benefits of strategic querying on stochastic
gradient-based methods compared to uniform querying strategy. We first
introduce Oracle Gradient Querying (OGQ), an idealized algorithm that selects
one user's gradient yielding the largest possible expected improvement (EI) at
each step. However, OGQ assumes oracle access to the gradients of all users to
make such a selection, which is impractical in real-world scenarios. To address
this limitation, we propose Strategic Gradient Querying (SGQ), a practical
algorithm that has better transient-state performance than SGD while making
only one query per iteration. For smooth objective functions satisfying the
Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, we show that under the assumption of EI
heterogeneity, OGQ enhances transient-state performance and reduces
steady-state variance, while SGQ improves transient-state performance over SGD.
Our numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings.

Conclusion: 该方法为密度聚类任务提供了有效的替代方案，显著降低了参数调优的复杂性

Abstract: Clustering algorithms are widely used in various applications, with
density-based methods such as Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications
with Noise (DBSCAN) being particularly prominent. These algorithms identify
clusters in high-density regions while treating sparser areas as noise.
However, reliance on user-defined parameters often poses optimization
challenges that require domain expertise. This paper presents a novel
density-based clustering method inspired by the concept of selective attention,
which minimizes the need for user-defined parameters under standard conditions.
Initially, the algorithm operates without requiring user-defined parameters. If
parameter adjustment is needed, the method simplifies the process by
introducing a single integer parameter that is straightforward to tune. The
approach computes a threshold to filter out the most sparsely distributed
points and outliers, forms a preliminary cluster structure, and then
reintegrates the excluded points to finalize the results. Experimental
evaluations on diverse data sets highlight the accessibility and robust
performance of the method, providing an effective alternative for density-based
clustering tasks.

safety in the face of cipher-enabled attackers while achieving the desired
level of fine-tuning functionality. We include diverse cipher encodings and
families, with some kept exclusively in the test set to evaluate for
generalization across unseen ciphers and cipher families. We then evaluate
different defenses on the benchmark and train probe monitors on model internal
activations from multiple fine-tunes. We show that probe monitors achieve over
99% detection accuracy, generalize to unseen cipher variants and families, and
compare favorably to state-of-the-art monitoring approaches. We open-source
CIFR and the code to reproduce our experiments to facilitate further research
in this critical area. Code and data are available online

### [419] [ONG: Orthogonal Natural Gradient Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17169)
*Yajat Yadav,Jathin Korrapati,Patrick Mendoza*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ONG（正交自然梯度下降）通过结合自然梯度与正交投影，在持续学习中实现了更好的性能，相比传统正交梯度下降在旋转和置换MNIST数据集上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的正交梯度下降方法使用欧几里得投影，忽略了神经网络参数化分布空间的信息几何结构，导致持续学习任务中的收敛性能不理想。

Method: 结合自然梯度思想，使用EKFAC近似Fisher信息矩阵的逆矩阵来预处理新任务梯度，然后将这些自然梯度投影到先前任务梯度的正交补空间上。

Result: 在Permuted和Rotated MNIST数据集上的实验表明，ONG相比传统方法在持续学习任务中具有更好的性能表现。

Conclusion: ONG方法通过考虑信息几何结构，在保持先前任务性能的同时，为新任务学习提供了更优的梯度下降方向，是持续学习领域的一个有效改进。

Abstract: Orthogonal gradient descent has emerged as a powerful method for continual
learning tasks. However, its Euclidean projections overlook the underlying
information-geometric structure of the space of distributions parametrized by
neural networks, which can lead to suboptimal convergence in learning tasks. To
counteract this, we combine it with the idea of the natural gradient and
present ONG (Orthogonal Natural Gradient Descent). ONG preconditions each new
task gradient with an efficient EKFAC approximation of the inverse Fisher
information matrix, yielding updates that follow the steepest descent direction
under a Riemannian metric. To preserve performance on previously learned tasks,
ONG projects these natural gradients onto the orthogonal complement of prior
task gradients. We provide a theoretical justification for this procedure,
introduce the ONG algorithm, and benchmark its performance on the Permuted and
Rotated MNIST datasets. All code for our experiments/reproducibility can be
found at https://github.com/yajatyadav/orthogonal-natural-gradient.

TL;DR: 提出SaGD框架，通过平滑对抗训练的尖锐损失景观来改进OOD检测，能区分对抗性ID样本和真实OOD样本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法将对抗性ID样本误判为OOD样本，且在对抗攻击下的ID和OOD数据检测研究较少

Method: 使用Sharpness-aware Geometric Defense框架，在投影潜在几何中平滑对抗损失景观，并采用Jitter-based扰动扩展防御能力

Result: 在CIFAR-100与6个OOD数据集的各种攻击下，SaGD显著提高了FPR和AUC指标，优于最先进防御方法

Conclusion: 平滑对抗损失景观能提升几何嵌入收敛性，改善对抗攻击下的OOD检测性能，揭示了尖锐损失景观与对抗OOD检测的关系

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection ensures safe and reliable model
deployment. Contemporary OOD algorithms using geometry projection can detect
OOD or adversarial samples from clean in-distribution (ID) samples. However,
this setting regards adversarial ID samples as OOD, leading to incorrect OOD
predictions. Existing efforts on OOD detection with ID and OOD data under
attacks are minimal. In this paper, we develop a robust OOD detection method
that distinguishes adversarial ID samples from OOD ones. The sharp loss
landscape created by adversarial training hinders model convergence, impacting
the latent embedding quality for OOD score calculation. Therefore, we introduce
a {\bf Sharpness-aware Geometric Defense (SaGD)} framework to smooth out the
rugged adversarial loss landscape in the projected latent geometry. Enhanced
geometric embedding convergence enables accurate ID data characterization,
benefiting OOD detection against adversarial attacks. We use Jitter-based
perturbation in adversarial training to extend the defense ability against
unseen attacks. Our SaGD framework significantly improves FPR and AUC over the
state-of-the-art defense approaches in differentiating CIFAR-100 from six other
OOD datasets under various attacks. We further examine the effects of
perturbations at various adversarial training levels, revealing the
relationship between the sharp loss landscape and adversarial OOD detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图神经网络难以捕获长距离依赖关系，图transformer通过注意力机制实现全局信息交换，但存在密集和稀疏两种注意力机制需要对比分析

Method: 对比分析密集注意力和稀疏注意力机制的性能差异和计算效率，探讨各自的适用场景

Result: 明确了两种注意力机制在计算复杂度、表达能力、实际应用效果等方面的权衡关系

Conclusion: 为图transformer注意力机制的选择提供了指导原则，指出了当前设计中的关键挑战和未来研究方向

Abstract: Graphs have become a central representation in machine learning for capturing
relational and structured data across various domains. Traditional graph neural
networks often struggle to capture long-range dependencies between nodes due to
their local structure. Graph transformers overcome this by using attention
mechanisms that allow nodes to exchange information globally. However, there
are two types of attention in graph transformers: dense and sparse. In this
paper, we compare these two attention mechanisms, analyze their trade-offs, and
highlight when to use each. We also outline current challenges and problems in
designing attention for graph transformers.

TL;DR: 通过机制可解释性方法分析LLM过度自信的内部机制，发现自信表征可分解为情感和逻辑两个正交子成分，分别对应心理学中的双路径精细加工可能性模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在高风险场景中经常表现出过度自信，以不必要的确定性呈现信息，需要研究其内部机制来理解这一行为。

Method: 使用人类标注的自信度数据集微调开源的Llama 3.2模型，提取所有层的残差激活，计算相似性指标来定位自信表征，识别对自信度对比最敏感的层。

Result: 发现高自信表征可分解为情感和逻辑两个正交子成分，情感向量广泛影响预测准确性，逻辑向量产生更局部化的效应。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM自信度的多组件结构提供了机制性证据，并指出了缓解过度自信行为的途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often display overconfidence, presenting
information with unwarranted certainty in high-stakes contexts. We investigate
the internal basis of this behavior via mechanistic interpretability. Using
open-sourced Llama 3.2 models fine-tuned on human annotated assertiveness
datasets, we extract residual activations across all layers, and compute
similarity metrics to localize assertive representations. Our analysis
identifies layers most sensitive to assertiveness contrasts and reveals that
high-assertive representations decompose into two orthogonal sub-components of
emotional and logical clusters-paralleling the dual-route Elaboration
Likelihood Model in Psychology. Steering vectors derived from these
sub-components show distinct causal effects: emotional vectors broadly
influence prediction accuracy, while logical vectors exert more localized
effects. These findings provide mechanistic evidence for the multi-component
structure of LLM assertiveness and highlight avenues for mitigating
overconfident behavior.

TL;DR: BudgetThinker是一个新颖的框架，通过在推理过程中插入特殊控制令牌来让LLM感知剩余token预算，实现预算感知的推理控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM通过增加测试时计算来提升推理能力，但会导致显著的延迟和资源成本，限制了在实时或成本敏感场景中的应用。

Method: 采用两阶段训练流程：首先通过监督微调让模型熟悉预算约束，然后通过基于课程的强化学习使用长度感知奖励函数来优化准确性和预算遵守。

Result: 在多个数学基准测试中，BudgetThinker在各种推理预算下显著超越了强基线模型，保持了性能表现。

Conclusion: 该方法为开发高效可控的LLM推理提供了可扩展的解决方案，使先进模型更适合在资源受限和实时环境中部署。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have leveraged increased
test-time computation to enhance reasoning capabilities, a strategy that, while
effective, incurs significant latency and resource costs, limiting their
applicability in real-world time-constrained or cost-sensitive scenarios. This
paper introduces BudgetThinker, a novel framework designed to empower LLMs with
budget-aware reasoning, enabling precise control over the length of their
thought processes. We propose a methodology that periodically inserts special
control tokens during inference to continuously inform the model of its
remaining token budget. This approach is coupled with a comprehensive two-stage
training pipeline, beginning with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to familiarize
the model with budget constraints, followed by a curriculum-based Reinforcement
Learning (RL) phase that utilizes a length-aware reward function to optimize
for both accuracy and budget adherence. We demonstrate that BudgetThinker
significantly surpasses strong baselines in maintaining performance across a
variety of reasoning budgets on challenging mathematical benchmarks. Our method
provides a scalable and effective solution for developing efficient and
controllable LLM reasoning, making advanced models more practical for
deployment in resource-constrained and real-time environments.

TL;DR: MedThreatRAG是一种针对医疗RAG系统的多模态中毒攻击框架，通过注入对抗性图像-文本对来破坏检索和生成性能，暴露了临床AI系统的安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在医疗AI中广泛使用检索增强生成技术，但这种对外部知识库的依赖创造了新的攻击面，需要系统性地探测医疗RAG系统的安全漏洞。

Method: 构建模拟半开放攻击环境，引入跨模态冲突注入(CMCI)技术，在医学图像和报告中植入微妙的语义矛盾，破坏跨模态对齐同时保持足够的合理性以规避传统过滤器。

Result: 在IU-Xray和MIMIC-CXR QA任务上，MedThreatRAG将答案F1分数降低了高达27.66%，使LLaVA-Med-1.5的F1率降至最低51.36%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了临床RAG系统的根本性安全漏洞，强调了威胁感知设计和鲁棒多模态一致性检查的迫切需求，并提供了安全开发多模态医疗RAG系统的指导原则。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) augmented with Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) are increasingly employed in medical AI to enhance factual
grounding through external clinical image-text retrieval. However, this
reliance creates a significant attack surface. We propose MedThreatRAG, a novel
multimodal poisoning framework that systematically probes vulnerabilities in
medical RAG systems by injecting adversarial image-text pairs. A key innovation
of our approach is the construction of a simulated semi-open attack
environment, mimicking real-world medical systems that permit periodic
knowledge base updates via user or pipeline contributions. Within this setting,
we introduce and emphasize Cross-Modal Conflict Injection (CMCI), which embeds
subtle semantic contradictions between medical images and their paired reports.
These mismatches degrade retrieval and generation by disrupting cross-modal
alignment while remaining sufficiently plausible to evade conventional filters.
While basic textual and visual attacks are included for completeness, CMCI
demonstrates the most severe degradation. Evaluations on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR
QA tasks show that MedThreatRAG reduces answer F1 scores by up to 27.66% and
lowers LLaVA-Med-1.5 F1 rates to as low as 51.36%. Our findings expose
fundamental security gaps in clinical RAG systems and highlight the urgent need
for threat-aware design and robust multimodal consistency checks. Finally, we
conclude with a concise set of guidelines to inform the safe development of
future multimodal medical RAG systems.

Motivation: 随着城市车辆数量快速增长，现有道路基础设施难以满足现代交通需求，导致拥堵问题。当前导航模型大多只关注确定性或时间依赖网络，忽略了交通流的关联性和随机性特征。

Method: 提出将决策Transformer与广义策略梯度(GPG)框架相结合的路径规划方案，利用决策Transformer建模长期依赖关系的能力来提高路径决策的准确性和稳定性。

Result: 在Sioux Falls网络上的实验结果表明，该方法在准时到达概率方面优于之前的基线方法，提供了更准确的路径规划解决方案。

Conclusion: 所提出的集成决策Transformer和GPG框架的路径规划方法能够有效处理随机交通网络中的可靠最短路径问题，在准确性和稳定性方面表现出色。

Abstract: With the rapidly increased number of vehicles in urban areas, existing road
infrastructure struggles to accommodate modern traffic demands, resulting in
the issue of congestion. This highlights the importance of efficient path
planning strategies. However, most recent navigation models focus solely on
deterministic or time-dependent networks, while overlooking the correlations
and the stochastic nature of traffic flows. In this work, we address the
reliable shortest path problem within stochastic transportation networks under
certain dependencies. We propose a path planning solution that integrates the
decision Transformer with the Generalized Policy Gradient (GPG) framework.
Based on the decision Transformer's capability to model long-term dependencies,
our proposed solution improves the accuracy and stability of path decisions.
Experimental results on the Sioux Falls Network (SFN) demonstrate that our
approach outperforms previous baselines in terms of on-time arrival
probability, providing more accurate path planning solutions.

Abstract: Hyperbolic neural networks (HNNs) have demonstrated notable efficacy in
representing real-world data with hierarchical structures via exploiting the
geometric properties of hyperbolic spaces characterized by negative curvatures.
Curvature plays a crucial role in optimizing HNNs. Inappropriate curvatures may
cause HNNs to converge to suboptimal parameters, degrading overall performance.
So far, the theoretical foundation of the effect of curvatures on HNNs has not
been developed. In this paper, we derive a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound of
HNNs, highlighting the role of curvatures in the generalization of HNNs via
their effect on the smoothness of the loss landscape. Driven by the derived
bound, we propose a sharpness-aware curvature learning method to smooth the
loss landscape, thereby improving the generalization of HNNs. In our method,
  we design a scope sharpness measure for curvatures, which is minimized
through a bi-level optimization process. Then, we introduce an implicit
differentiation algorithm that efficiently solves the bi-level optimization by
approximating gradients of curvatures. We present the approximation error and
convergence analyses of the proposed method, showing that the approximation
error is upper-bounded, and the proposed method can converge by bounding
gradients of HNNs. Experiments on four settings: classification, learning from
long-tailed data, learning from noisy data, and few-shot learning show that our
method can improve the performance of HNNs.

Result: 在各种Transformer模型和数据集上的广泛实验证明了MAPE-Unlearn在遗忘任务中的有效性和鲁棒性

Conclusion: MAPE-Unlearn通过模块感知的方法成功解决了Transformer模型的高效遗忘问题，为遵守隐私法规提供了有效的技术解决方案

Abstract: Transformer has become fundamental to a vast series of pre-trained large
models that have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications.
Machine unlearning, which focuses on efficiently removing specific data
influences to comply with privacy regulations, shows promise in restricting
updates to influence-critical parameters. However, existing parameter-efficient
unlearning methods are largely devised in a module-oblivious manner, which
tends to inaccurately identify these parameters and leads to inferior
unlearning performance for Transformers. In this paper, we propose {\tt
MAPE-Unlearn}, a module-aware parameter-efficient machine unlearning approach
that uses a learnable pair of masks to pinpoint influence-critical parameters
in the heads and filters of Transformers. The learning objective of these masks
is derived by desiderata of unlearning and optimized through an efficient
algorithm featured by a greedy search with a warm start. Extensive experiments
on various Transformer models and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
robustness of {\tt MAPE-Unlearn} for unlearning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统复杂度度量（如VC维、PAC-Bayes边界）在过参数化情况下变得空洞，无法解释Transformer等模型的实际泛化成功

Method: 基于注意力矩阵的有效秩来定义注意力模型的容量，分析其谱特性而非原始参数数量

Result: 该方法导出的泛化边界与大型语言模型观察到的经验缩放规律相匹配（最多相差对数因子）

Conclusion: 注意力谱特性而非参数数量可能是理解过参数化模型泛化能力的关键视角

Abstract: Deep neural networks often contain far more parameters than training
examples, yet they still manage to generalize well in practice. Classical
complexity measures such as VC-dimension or PAC-Bayes bounds usually become
vacuous in this overparameterized regime, offering little explanation for the
empirical success of models like Transformers. In this work, I explore an
alternative notion of capacity for attention-based models, based on the
effective rank of their attention matrices. The intuition is that, although the
parameter count is enormous, the functional dimensionality of attention is
often much lower. I show that this quantity leads to a generalization bound
whose dependence on sample size matches empirical scaling laws observed in
large language models, up to logarithmic factors. While the analysis is not a
complete theory of overparameterized learning, it provides evidence that
spectral properties of attention, rather than raw parameter counts, may be the
right lens for understanding why these models generalize.

Abstract: . Predicting and calculating the aerodynamic coefficients of airfoils near
the ground with CFD software requires much time. However, the availability of

methods have made it possible to present the simulation results using methods
like VGG, a CCN neural network method. In this article, lift-to-drag
coefficients of airfoils near the ground surface are predicted with the help of
a neural network. This prediction can only be realized by providing data for
training and learning the code that contains information on the lift-to-drag
ratio of the primary data and images related to the airfoil cross-section,
which are converted into a matrix. One advantage of the VGG method over other
methods is that its results are more accurate than those of other CNN methods.

Motivation: 深度学习在心电图心律失常检测中准确性高但可解释性差，阻碍了临床应用，需要开发专门针对时间序列心电图分析的可解释AI方法。

Method: 使用MIT-BIH心律失常数据集，开发基于卷积神经网络的分类模型，采用Pan-Tompkins算法进行R峰分割，整合12导联心电图数据集，实施四种SHAP方法进行比较。

Result: 模型在MIT-BIH上达到98.3%验证准确率，但在组合数据集上性能下降；梯度方法和DeepLIFT能突出与临床推理一致的波形区域，但存在样本间变异性。

Conclusion: 心电图分析需要领域特定的可解释AI适配，显著图映射是更符合临床直觉的方法，医学专业人员更偏好基于显著图的解释而非反事实可视化。

Abstract: Advancements in deep learning have enabled highly accurate arrhythmia
detection from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, but limited interpretability
remains a barrier to clinical adoption. This study investigates the application
of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques specifically adapted for time-series ECG
analysis. Using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset, a convolutional neural
network-based model was developed for arrhythmia classification, with
R-peak-based segmentation via the Pan-Tompkins algorithm. To increase the
dataset size and to reduce class imbalance, an additional 12-lead ECG dataset
was incorporated. A user needs assessment was carried out to identify what kind
of explanation would be preferred by medical professionals. Medical
professionals indicated a preference for saliency map-based explanations over
counterfactual visualisations, citing clearer correspondence with ECG
interpretation workflows. Four SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based
approaches: permutation importance, KernelSHAP, gradient-based methods, and
Deep Learning Important FeaTures (DeepLIFT), were implemented and compared. The
model achieved 98.3% validation accuracy on MIT-BIH but showed performance
degradation on the combined dataset, underscoring dataset variability
challenges. Permutation importance and KernelSHAP produced cluttered visual
outputs, while gradient-based and DeepLIFT methods highlighted waveform regions
consistent with clinical reasoning, but with variability across samples.
Findings emphasize the need for domain-specific XAI adaptations in ECG analysis
and highlight saliency mapping as a more clinically intuitive approach

TL;DR: 提出了基于物理信息的神经网络(PINN)框架来预测核反应堆用辐照奥氏体和铁素体/马氏体钢的低周疲劳寿命，相比传统机器学习方法具有更高精度和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核反应堆材料在高温循环载荷和辐照条件下会发生复杂退化，传统经验模型无法准确预测其疲劳寿命，需要开发更精确的预测方法。

Method: 开发PINN模型，在损失函数中融入物理疲劳寿命约束，使用495个数据点（包括辐照和未辐照条件）进行训练。

Result: PINN模型在预测精度上优于随机森林、梯度提升、XGBoost和传统神经网络，识别出应变幅值、辐照剂量和测试温度为关键影响因素。

Conclusion: PINN框架为预测辐照合金疲劳寿命提供了可靠且可解释的方法，有助于明智的合金选择决策。

Abstract: This study proposes a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework to
predict the low-cycle fatigue (LCF) life of irradiated austenitic and
ferritic/martensitic (F/M) steels used in nuclear reactors. These materials
experience cyclic loading and irradiation at elevated temperatures, causing
complex degradation that traditional empirical models fail to capture
accurately. The developed PINN model incorporates physical fatigue life
constraints into its loss function, improving prediction accuracy and
generalizability. Trained on 495 data points, including both irradiated and
unirradiated conditions, the model outperforms traditional machine learning
models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and
the conventional Neural Network. SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis
identifies strain amplitude, irradiation dose, and testing temperature as
dominant features, each inversely correlated with fatigue life, consistent with
physical understanding. PINN captures saturation behaviour in fatigue life at
higher strain amplitudes in F/M steels. Overall, the PINN framework offers a
reliable and interpretable approach for predicting fatigue life in irradiated
alloys, enabling informed alloy selection.

Result: 在三个语言模型(Pythia-70M、Pythia-160M和Gemma-2-2B)上的实验表明，该方法在重建保真度、解释方差和余弦相似度指标上显著优于固定稀疏度方法

Conclusion: 复杂度驱动的自适应方法不仅性能更优，还消除了大量超参数调优的计算负担，为LLM内部表示的可解释性研究提供了更有效的解决方案

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models (LLMs)
remains a central challenge for interpretability research. Sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) offer a promising solution by decomposing activations into interpretable
features, but existing approaches rely on fixed sparsity constraints that fail
to account for input complexity. We propose Adaptive Top K Sparse Autoencoders
(AdaptiveK), a novel framework that dynamically adjusts sparsity levels based
on the semantic complexity of each input. Leveraging linear probes, we
demonstrate that context complexity is linearly encoded in LLM representations,
and we use this signal to guide feature allocation during training. Experiments
across three language models (Pythia-70M, Pythia-160M, and Gemma-2-2B)
demonstrate that this complexity-driven adaptation significantly outperforms
fixed-sparsity approaches on reconstruction fidelity, explained variance, and
cosine similarity metrics while eliminating the computational burden of
extensive hyperparameter tuning.

Motivation: 研究神经网络在弯曲域（如球面）上的频率相关学习动态，特别是频率优先原则(FP)的适用性和局限性，以及权重可训练性对学习过程的影响。

Method: 使用球谐函数展开分析固定权重和可训练权重情况下的学习动态，通过理论分析和数值实验验证频率衰减规律和学习行为。

Result: 固定权重时谐波系数以O(ℓ^{5/2}/2^ℓ)衰减，可训练权重时衰减为O(ℓ^{7/2}/2^ℓ)，都倾向于低频优先学习，但在特定条件下FP可能被违反。可训练方向增加了学习复杂性，可能保持低频优势或实现更快的高频出现。

preference with coefficients decaying as \(O(\ell^{5/2}/2^\ell)\), typically
leading to the Frequency Principle (FP) of lower-frequency-first learning.
However, this principle can be violated under specific initial conditions or
error distributions. With trainable weights, an additional rotation term in the
harmonic evolution equations preserves exponential decay with decay order
\(O(\ell^{7/2}/2^\ell)\) factor, also leading to the FP of
lower-frequency-first learning. But like fixed weights case, the principle can
be violated under specific initial conditions or error distributions. Our
numerical results demonstrate that trainable directions increase learning
complexity and can either maintain a low-frequency advantage or enable faster
high-frequency emergence. This analysis suggests the FP should be viewed as a
tendency rather than a rule on curved domains like \(S^2\), providing insights
into how direction updates and harmonic expansions shape frequency-dependent
learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集中式架构无法满足元宇宙应用在性能、隐私和环境可持续性方面的复杂需求，存在高能耗、延迟和隐私问题。

Method: 集成多智能体强化学习进行动态客户端选择，使用同态加密实现隐私保护的联邦学习，采用与可再生能源可用性对齐的碳感知调度。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of immersive Metaverse applications introduces complex
challenges at the intersection of performance, privacy, and environmental
sustainability. Centralized architectures fall short in addressing these
demands, often resulting in elevated energy consumption, latency, and privacy
concerns. This paper proposes MetaFed, a decentralized federated learning (FL)
framework that enables sustainable and intelligent resource orchestration for
Metaverse environments. MetaFed integrates (i) multi-agent reinforcement
learning for dynamic client selection, (ii) privacy-preserving FL using
homomorphic encryption, and (iii) carbon-aware scheduling aligned with
renewable energy availability. Evaluations on MNIST and CIFAR-10 using
lightweight ResNet architectures demonstrate that MetaFed achieves up to 25\%
reduction in carbon emissions compared to conventional approaches, while
maintaining high accuracy and minimal communication overhead. These results
highlight MetaFed as a scalable solution for building environmentally
responsible and privacy-compliant Metaverse infrastructures.

TL;DR: 本文发现并利用LLM代码分析中的抽象偏差漏洞，提出熟悉模式攻击(FPA)，通过最小代码编辑即可误导LLM忽略真实漏洞，该攻击具有跨模型和跨语言的通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM被广泛用于自动化代码审查和静态分析，需要识别其潜在的安全漏洞，特别是模型可能因过度泛化熟悉编程模式而忽略细微漏洞的抽象偏差问题。

Method: 开发了完全自动化的黑盒算法来发现和注入熟悉模式攻击(FPA)，通过在目标代码中进行最小编辑来利用LLM的抽象偏差，而不影响实际运行时行为。

Result: FPA攻击对GPT-4o、Claude 3.5、Gemini 2.0等多种模型有效，且在Python、C、Rust、Go等多种编程语言中具有通用性，即使使用强化系统提示警告模型，攻击仍然有效。

Conclusion: FPA攻击揭示了代码导向LLMs在可靠性和安全性方面的严重漏洞，同时也探讨了FPA在防御性应用中的潜在价值，对LLM代码分析系统的安全性提出了重要警示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trusted to perform automated
code review and static analysis at scale, supporting tasks such as
vulnerability detection, summarization, and refactoring. In this paper, we
identify and exploit a critical vulnerability in LLM-based code analysis: an
abstraction bias that causes models to overgeneralize familiar programming
patterns and overlook small, meaningful bugs. Adversaries can exploit this
blind spot to hijack the control flow of the LLM's interpretation with minimal
edits and without affecting actual runtime behavior. We refer to this attack as
a Familiar Pattern Attack (FPA).
  We develop a fully automated, black-box algorithm that discovers and injects
FPAs into target code. Our evaluation shows that FPAs are not only effective,
but also transferable across models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini 2.0) and
universal across programming languages (Python, C, Rust, Go). Moreover, FPAs
remain effective even when models are explicitly warned about the attack via
robust system prompts. Finally, we explore positive, defensive uses of FPAs and
discuss their broader implications for the reliability and safety of
code-oriented LLMs.

Motivation: 现有的多模态方法往往过度关注模态特定的细节组合，而忽略了跨模态共享的高层语义概念。多模态VAE虽然旨在捕获共享表示，但在表达性联合变分后验设计和合成质量方面存在困难。

Method: ShaLa框架整合了新颖的架构推理模型和第二阶段表达性扩散先验，既促进了共享潜在表示的有效推理，又显著提升了多模态合成质量。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ShaLa表现出比最先进多模态VAE更优越的一致性和合成质量，并且能够扩展到更多模态，而传统方法难以捕获日益复杂的共享潜在空间。

Conclusion: ShaLa成功解决了多模态VAE的关键挑战，提供了一个有效的框架来学习跨模态共享潜在表示，同时显著提升了合成性能和多模态扩展能力。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel generative framework for learning shared latent
representations across multimodal data. Many advanced multimodal methods focus
on capturing all combinations of modality-specific details across inputs, which
can inadvertently obscure the high-level semantic concepts that are shared
across modalities. Notably, Multimodal VAEs with low-dimensional latent
variables are designed to capture shared representations, enabling various
tasks such as joint multimodal synthesis and cross-modal inference. However,
multimodal VAEs often struggle to design expressive joint variational
posteriors and suffer from low-quality synthesis. In this work, ShaLa addresses
these challenges by integrating a novel architectural inference model and a
second-stage expressive diffusion prior, which not only facilitates effective
inference of shared latent representation but also significantly improves the
quality of downstream multimodal synthesis. We validate ShaLa extensively
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating superior coherence and synthesis
quality compared to state-of-the-art multimodal VAEs. Furthermore, ShaLa scales
to many more modalities while prior multimodal VAEs have fallen short in
capturing the increasing complexity of the shared latent space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习面临客户端计算资源受限和缺乏对常见数据损坏（如噪声、模糊、天气效应）鲁棒性的双重挑战，现有鲁棒训练方法计算成本高，不适合资源受限的客户端。

Method: 提出FedERL框架，采用新颖的数据无关鲁棒训练（DART）方法在服务器端增强模型鲁棒性，无需访问训练数据，确保客户端零鲁棒性开销。

Result: 大量实验表明，FedERL以传统鲁棒训练方法的一小部分时间和能耗成本处理常见损坏，在有限时间和能耗预算下性能超越传统方法。

Conclusion: FedERL为现实世界联邦学习应用提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案，能够在客户端资源约束下有效提升模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) accelerates the deployment of deep learning models on
edge devices while preserving data privacy. However, FL systems face challenges
due to client-side constraints on computational resources, and from a lack of
robustness to common corruptions such as noise, blur, and weather effects.
Existing robust training methods are computationally expensive and unsuitable
for resource-constrained clients. We propose FedERL, federated efficient and
robust learning, as the first work to explicitly address corruption robustness
under time and energy constraints on the client side. At its core, FedERL
employs a novel data-agnostic robust training (DART) method on the server to
enhance robustness without access to the training data. In doing so, FedERL
ensures zero robustness overhead for clients. Extensive experiments demonstrate
FedERL's ability to handle common corruptions at a fraction of the time and
energy cost of traditional robust training methods. In scenarios with limited
time and energy budgets, FedERL surpasses the performance of traditional robust
training, establishing it as a practical and scalable solution for real-world
FL applications.

Abstract: Generalizing to unseen graph tasks without task-pecific supervision remains
challenging. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are limited by fixed label spaces,
while Large Language Models (LLMs) lack structural inductive biases. Recent
advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) provide a zero-shot alternative via
explicit, long chain-of-thought reasoning. Inspired by this, we propose a
GNN-free approach that reformulates graph tasks--node classification, link
prediction, and graph classification--as textual reasoning problems solved by
LRMs. We introduce the first datasets with detailed reasoning traces for these
tasks and develop Graph-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that leverages
task-specific rethink templates to guide reasoning over linearized graphs.
Experiments demonstrate that Graph-R1 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
zero-shot settings, producing interpretable and effective predictions. Our work
highlights the promise of explicit reasoning for graph learning and provides
new resources for future research.

Motivation: 现有多关系图聚类方法要么因异构图结构和属性融合效果差而导致结果质量严重受损，要么因采用复杂昂贵的深度学习模型而难以处理大规模图数据

Method: 基于新颖的两阶段优化目标：第一阶段通过优化多关系Dirichlet能量获得高质量节点特征向量，第二阶段在节点亲和图上最小化聚类结果的Dirichlet能量。DEMM+通过高效近似求解器和理论化问题转换实现线性时间聚类

Result: 在11个真实多关系图上与20个基线方法比较，DEMM+在聚类质量方面持续优于其他方法，同时速度显著更快

Conclusion: DEMM+方法在多关系图聚类任务中实现了优异的聚类质量和高效的可扩展性，能够处理大规模图数据且无需显式构建稠密亲和矩阵

Abstract: Multi-relational graphs (MRGs) are an expressive data structure for modeling
diverse interactions/relations among real objects (i.e., nodes), which pervade
extensive applications and scenarios. Given an MRG G with N nodes, partitioning
the node set therein into K disjoint clusters (MRGC) is a fundamental task in
analyzing MRGs, which has garnered considerable attention. However, the
majority of existing solutions towards MRGC either yield severely compromised
result quality by ineffective fusion of heterogeneous graph structures and
attributes, or struggle to cope with sizable MRGs with millions of nodes and
billions of edges due to the adoption of sophisticated and costly deep learning
models.
  In this paper, we present DEMM and DEMM+, two effective MRGC approaches to
address the limitations above. Specifically, our algorithms are built on novel
two-stage optimization objectives, where the former seeks to derive
high-caliber node feature vectors by optimizing the multi-relational Dirichlet
energy specialized for MRGs, while the latter minimizes the Dirichlet energy of
clustering results over the node affinity graph. In particular, DEMM+ achieves
significantly higher scalability and efficiency over our based method DEMM
through a suite of well-thought-out optimizations. Key technical contributions
include (i) a highly efficient approximation solver for constructing node
feature vectors, and (ii) a theoretically-grounded problem transformation with
carefully-crafted techniques that enable linear-time clustering without
explicitly materializing the NxN dense affinity matrix. Further, we extend
DEMM+ to handle attribute-less MRGs through non-trivial adaptations. Extensive
experiments, comparing DEMM+ against 20 baselines over 11 real MRGs, exhibit
that DEMM+ is consistently superior in terms of clustering quality measured
against ground-truth labels, while often being remarkably faster.

Motivation: 研究检索性能如何随预训练计算量（FLOPs）的变化而扩展，为开发基于LLM的检索器提供指导。

Method: 在125M到7B参数的LLM模型上进行基准测试，使用从10亿到超过2万亿tokens的数据集进行预训练，评估零样本BEIR任务的检索性能。

Abstract: How does retrieval performance scale with pretraining FLOPs? We benchmark
retrieval performance across LLM model sizes from 125 million parameters to 7

retrieval scores across retrieval tasks. Finally, we highlight the implications
this has for the development of LLM-based retrievers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自主实验系统缺乏检测和适应意外情况的机制，传统惊喜度量只能检测偏差但无法捕捉系统是否真正在学习适应

Method: 引入互信息惊喜(MIS)量化新观测对互信息的影响，开发统计测试序列检测互信息变化，提出MISRP策略通过采样调整和进程分叉动态控制系统行为

Result: 在合成领域和动态污染地图估计任务中，MISRP策略在稳定性、响应性和预测准确性方面显著优于传统基于惊喜的方法

Conclusion: MIS框架将惊喜从反应性转变为反思性，为构建更具自我意识和适应性的自主系统提供了路径

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in autonomous experimentation have demonstrated
remarkable physical capabilities, yet their cognitive control remains
limited--often relying on static heuristics or classical optimization. A core
limitation is the absence of a principled mechanism to detect and adapt to the
unexpectedness. While traditional surprise measures--such as Shannon or
Bayesian Surprise--offer momentary detection of deviation, they fail to capture
whether a system is truly learning and adapting. In this work, we introduce
Mutual Information Surprise (MIS), a new framework that redefines surprise not
as anomaly detection, but as a signal of epistemic growth. MIS quantifies the
impact of new observations on mutual information, enabling autonomous systems
to reflect on their learning progression. We develop a statistical test
sequence to detect meaningful shifts in estimated mutual information and
propose a mutual information surprise reaction policy (MISRP) that dynamically
governs system behavior through sampling adjustment and process forking.
Empirical evaluations--on both synthetic domains and a dynamic pollution map
estimation task--show that MISRP-governed strategies significantly outperform
classical surprise-based approaches in stability, responsiveness, and
predictive accuracy. By shifting surprise from reactive to reflective, MIS
offers a path toward more self-aware and adaptive autonomous systems.

TL;DR: FRAME是一个自动化框架，用于评估对抗性机器学习风险，通过系统评估部署环境、攻击技术和实证研究三个维度来量化风险，支持跨领域应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统风险评估框架无法应对对抗性机器学习威胁，现有方法主要关注技术攻击鲁棒性，忽视了部署环境、系统依赖和攻击可行性等现实因素，需要全面的跨领域风险评估方案。

Method: 开发FRAME框架，包含新颖的风险评估方法，量化三个关键维度：目标系统部署环境、多样化AML技术特征、先前研究的实证见解；采用可行性评分机制和基于LLM的系统特定评估定制；构建全面的结构化AML攻击数据集。

Result: 在六个不同的真实世界应用中验证，表现出卓越的准确性和与AML专家分析的高度一致性，能够为系统所有者提供可直接使用的可操作结果。

Conclusion: FRAME使组织能够优先处理AML风险，支持在真实环境中安全部署AI系统，填补了现有风险评估方法的空白。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of machine learning (ML) systems increased attention
to their security and emergence of adversarial machine learning (AML)
techniques that exploit fundamental vulnerabilities in ML systems, creating an
urgent need for comprehensive risk assessment for ML-based systems. While
traditional risk assessment frameworks evaluate conventional cybersecurity
risks, they lack ability to address unique challenges posed by AML threats.
Existing AML threat evaluation approaches focus primarily on technical attack
robustness, overlooking crucial real-world factors like deployment
environments, system dependencies, and attack feasibility. Attempts at
comprehensive AML risk assessment have been limited to domain-specific
solutions, preventing application across diverse systems. Addressing these
limitations, we present FRAME, the first comprehensive and automated framework
for assessing AML risks across diverse ML-based systems. FRAME includes a novel
risk assessment method that quantifies AML risks by systematically evaluating
three key dimensions: target system's deployment environment, characteristics
of diverse AML techniques, and empirical insights from prior research. FRAME
incorporates a feasibility scoring mechanism and LLM-based customization for
system-specific assessments. Additionally, we developed a comprehensive
structured dataset of AML attacks enabling context-aware risk assessment. From
an engineering application perspective, FRAME delivers actionable results
designed for direct use by system owners with only technical knowledge of their
systems, without expertise in AML. We validated it across six diverse
real-world applications. Our evaluation demonstrated exceptional accuracy and
strong alignment with analysis by AML experts. FRAME enables organizations to
prioritize AML risks, supporting secure AI deployment in real-world
environments.

TL;DR: 提出Anti-regularization方法，通过添加符号反转的奖励项在小样本情况下增加模型表达能力，并随样本量增加而衰减干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小样本学习中的欠拟合问题，在数据受限情况下提高模型表达能力，同时保持泛化性能。

Method: 使用符号反转的奖励项增加模型表达性，采用幂律衰减机制，结合投影算子和梯度裁剪的稳定性保障措施。

Result: 在回归和分类任务中减少欠拟合，保持泛化能力并改善校准性能，在数据和资源受限环境中实现鲁棒学习。

Conclusion: Anti-regularization是一种简单易实现的方法，能有效提升小样本学习性能，通过智能衰减机制避免过拟合和数值不稳定问题。

Abstract: We propose Anti-regularization (AR), which adds a sign-reversed reward term
to the loss to intentionally increase model expressivity in the small-sample
regime, and then attenuates this intervention with a power-law decay as the
sample size grows. We formalize spectral safety and trust-region conditions,
and design a lightweight stability safeguard that combines a projection
operator with gradient clipping, ensuring stable intervention under stated
assumptions. Our analysis spans linear smoothers and the Neural Tangent Kernel
(NTK) regime, providing practical guidance on selecting the decay exponent by
balancing empirical risk against variance. Empirically, AR reduces underfitting
while preserving generalization and improving calibration in both regression
and classification. Ablation studies confirm that the decay schedule and the
stability safeguard are critical to preventing overfitting and numerical
instability. We further examine a degrees-of-freedom targeting schedule that
keeps per-sample complexity approximately constant. AR is simple to implement
and reproducible, integrating cleanly into standard empirical risk minimization
pipelines. It enables robust learning in data- and resource-constrained
settings by intervening only when beneficial and fading away when unnecessary.

Result: 在图像合成和轨迹建模任务中，MMF实现了有竞争力的样本质量、鲁棒收敛和强泛化能力，特别是在低数据或分布外设置下表现优异。

Conclusion: MMF统一并推广了现有的一致性方法和流匹配方法，避免了昂贵的高阶导数计算，为高效生成建模提供了理论基础和实用框架。

Abstract: One-step generative modeling seeks to generate high-quality data samples in a
single function evaluation, significantly improving efficiency over traditional
diffusion or flow-based models. In this work, we introduce Modular MeanFlow
(MMF), a flexible and theoretically grounded approach for learning
time-averaged velocity fields. Our method derives a family of loss functions
based on a differential identity linking instantaneous and average velocities,
and incorporates a gradient modulation mechanism that enables stable training
without sacrificing expressiveness. We further propose a curriculum-style
warmup schedule to smoothly transition from coarse supervision to fully
differentiable training. The MMF formulation unifies and generalizes existing
consistency-based and flow-matching methods, while avoiding expensive
higher-order derivatives. Empirical results across image synthesis and
trajectory modeling tasks demonstrate that MMF achieves competitive sample
quality, robust convergence, and strong generalization, particularly under
low-data or out-of-distribution settings.

Abstract: Recent advancements in aligning large language models via reinforcement
learning have achieved remarkable gains in solving complex reasoning problems,
but at the cost of expensive on-policy rollouts and limited exploration of
diverse reasoning paths. In this work, we introduce TreePO, involving a
self-guided rollout algorithm that views sequence generation as a
tree-structured searching process. Composed of dynamic tree sampling policy and
fixed-length segment decoding, TreePO leverages local uncertainty to warrant
additional branches. By amortizing computation across common prefixes and
pruning low-value paths early, TreePO essentially reduces the per-update
compute burden while preserving or enhancing exploration diversity. Key
contributions include: (1) a segment-wise sampling algorithm that alleviates
the KV cache burden through contiguous segments and spawns new branches along
with an early-stop mechanism; (2) a tree-based segment-level advantage
estimation that considers both global and local proximal policy optimization.
and (3) analysis on the effectiveness of probability and quality-driven dynamic
divergence and fallback strategy. We empirically validate the performance gain
of TreePO on a set reasoning benchmarks and the efficiency saving of GPU hours
from 22\% up to 43\% of the sampling design for the trained models, meanwhile
showing up to 40\% reduction at trajectory-level and 35\% at token-level
sampling compute for the existing models. While offering a free lunch of
inference efficiency, TreePO reveals a practical path toward scaling RL-based
post-training with fewer samples and less compute. Home page locates at

TL;DR: 本文针对鲁棒约束强化学习中强对偶性不成立的问题，提出了无需对偶形式的Rectified Robust Policy Optimization (RRPO)算法，在理论保证下收敛到近似最优可行策略，并在网格世界环境中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于对偶的方法在鲁棒约束强化学习中可能失效，因为强对偶性一般不成立，需要开发不依赖对偶形式的原始算法。

Method: 提出Rectified Robust Policy Optimization (RRPO)算法，直接在原始问题上操作，通过控制不确定性集直径在特定水平来保证收敛。

Result: 理论证明在温和正则性假设下，RRPO能以匹配已知最优下界的迭代复杂度收敛到近似最优可行策略；实验验证在模型不确定性下实现鲁棒安全性能。

Conclusion: RRPO有效解决了鲁棒约束RL中对偶方法失效的问题，为在模型不确定性下实现安全约束提供了可行的原始算法解决方案。

Abstract: The goal of robust constrained reinforcement learning (RL) is to optimize an
agent's performance under the worst-case model uncertainty while satisfying
safety or resource constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate that strong
duality does not generally hold in robust constrained RL, indicating that
traditional primal-dual methods may fail to find optimal feasible policies. To
overcome this limitation, we propose a novel primal-only algorithm called
Rectified Robust Policy Optimization (RRPO), which operates directly on the
primal problem without relying on dual formulations. We provide theoretical
convergence guarantees under mild regularity assumptions, showing convergence
to an approximately optimal feasible policy with iteration complexity matching
the best-known lower bound when the uncertainty set diameter is controlled in a
specific level. Empirical results in a grid-world environment validate the
effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating that RRPO achieves robust and safe
performance under model uncertainties while the non-robust method can violate

TL;DR: ReviBranch是一个新颖的深度强化学习框架，通过构建复活轨迹和重要性加权奖励重分配机制，解决了混合整数线性规划中分支变量选择的稀疏奖励和动态状态表示挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分支启发式方法在异构问题实例间泛化能力差，现有学习方法如模仿学习依赖专家演示质量，强化学习面临稀疏奖励和动态状态表示的挑战。

Method: 提出ReviBranch框架：1）通过复活分支决策与图状态之间的历史对应关系构建复活轨迹；2）引入重要性加权奖励重分配机制，将稀疏终端奖励转化为密集的逐步反馈。

Result: 在不同MILP基准测试中，ReviBranch优于最先进的RL方法，在大规模实例上减少B&B节点4.0%和LP迭代2.2%。

Conclusion: ReviBranch在异构MILP问题类别中表现出强大的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为解决分支变量选择问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The Branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithm is the main solver for Mixed Integer
Linear Programs (MILPs), where the selection of branching variable is essential
to computational efficiency. However, traditional heuristics for branching
often fail to generalize across heterogeneous problem instances, while existing
learning-based methods such as imitation learning (IL) suffers from dependence
on expert demonstration quality, and reinforcement learning (RL) struggles with
limitations in sparse rewards and dynamic state representation challenges. To
address these issues, we propose ReviBranch, a novel deep RL framework that
constructs revived trajectories by reviving explicit historical correspondences
between branching decisions and their corresponding graph states along
search-tree paths. During training, ReviBranch enables agents to learn from
complete structural evolution and temporal dependencies within the branching
process. Additionally, we introduce an importance-weighted reward
redistribution mechanism that transforms sparse terminal rewards into dense
stepwise feedback, addressing the sparse reward challenge. Extensive
experiments on different MILP benchmarks demonstrate that ReviBranch
outperforms state-of-the-art RL methods, reducing B&B nodes by 4.0% and LP
iterations by 2.2% on large-scale instances. The results highlight the
robustness and generalizability of ReviBranch across heterogeneous MILP problem
classes.

Abstract: Classification in the context of multi-label data streams represents a
challenge that has attracted significant attention due to its high real-world
applicability. However, this task faces problems inherent to dynamic
environments, such as the continuous arrival of data at high speed and volume,
changes in the data distribution (concept drift), the emergence of new labels
(concept evolution), and the latency in the arrival of ground truth labels.
This systematic literature review presents an in-depth analysis of multi-label
data stream classification proposals. We characterize the latest methods in the
literature, providing a comprehensive overview, building a thorough hierarchy,
and discussing how the proposals approach each problem. Furthermore, we discuss
the adopted evaluation strategies and analyze the methods' asymptotic
complexity and resource consumption. Finally, we identify the main gaps and
offer recommendations for future research directions in the field.

*Liv Gorton,Owen Lewis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出叠加(superposition)可能是对抗样本现象的主要成因，通过理论分析、玩具模型实验和ResNet18实验提供了四方面证据支持这一假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗样本作为深度学习中最令人困惑的现象之一，近十年来缺乏共识性的解释机制。作者探索了叠加这一机制可解释性概念作为潜在的主要成因。

Method: 采用四重证据链方法：1)理论分析叠加解释对抗现象的能力；2)在玩具模型中通过干预叠加控制鲁棒性；3)在玩具模型中通过对抗训练干预鲁棒性控制叠加；4)在ResNet18中通过对抗训练干预鲁棒性控制叠加。

Result: 研究证实叠加与对抗鲁棒性之间存在双向因果关系：干预叠加可以影响模型鲁棒性，反之通过对抗训练干预鲁棒性也会影响叠加现象。

Conclusion: 叠加是导致对抗样本现象的重要因素，甚至可能是主要原因，这为理解对抗样本提供了新的机制性解释框架。

Abstract: Adversarial examples -- inputs with imperceptible perturbations that fool
neural networks -- remain one of deep learning's most perplexing phenomena
despite nearly a decade of research. While numerous defenses and explanations
have been proposed, there is no consensus on the fundamental mechanism. One
underexplored hypothesis is that superposition, a concept from mechanistic
interpretability, may be a major contributing factor, or even the primary
cause. We present four lines of evidence in support of this hypothesis, greatly
extending prior arguments by Elhage et al. (2022): (1) superposition can
theoretically explain a range of adversarial phenomena, (2) in toy models,
intervening on superposition controls robustness, (3) in toy models,
intervening on robustness (via adversarial training) controls superposition,
and (4) in ResNet18, intervening on robustness (via adversarial training)
controls superposition.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have enabled the scaling of Large Language
Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) by achieving massive parameter
counts while maintaining computational efficiency. However, MoEs introduce
several inference-time challenges, including load imbalance across experts and
the additional routing computational overhead. To address these challenges and
fully harness the benefits of MoE, a systematic evaluation of hardware
acceleration techniques is essential. We present MoE-Inference-Bench, a
comprehensive study to evaluate MoE performance across diverse scenarios. We
analyze the impact of batch size, sequence length, and critical MoE
hyperparameters such as FFN dimensions and number of experts on throughput. We
evaluate several optimization techniques on Nvidia H100 GPUs, including
pruning, Fused MoE operations, speculative decoding, quantization, and various
parallelization strategies. Our evaluation includes MoEs from the Mixtral,
DeepSeek, OLMoE and Qwen families. The results reveal performance differences

MoEs.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的模型无关方法，用于识别和纠正预测性业务过程监控模型中的偏见决策，尽管敏感属性可能同时被公平和不公平地使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测性过程监控模型虽然预测性能力强大，但容易受到数据中不公平、偏见或不道德模式的影响，导致基于性别、年龄等敏感属性的偏见预测。但敏感属性在同一过程中可能同时被公平和不公幵地使用。

Method: 提出了一种模型无关方法，采用人在循环方式，通过对从原始预测模型精炼的决策树模型进行简单修改，来区分公平和不公平的决策。

Result: 结果显示，在存在偏见数据的情况下，所提方法在公平性和准确性之间实现了有望的平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效地识别和纠正预测模型中的偏见问题，尽管敏感属性可能同时被公平和不公平地使用，为企业提供了一种主动应对和干预运行业务过程的新方法。

Abstract: Predictive process monitoring enables organizations to proactively react and
intervene in running instances of a business process. Given an incomplete
process instance, predictions about the outcome, next activity, or remaining
time are created. This is done by powerful machine learning models, which have
shown impressive predictive performance. However, the data-driven nature of
these models makes them susceptible to finding unfair, biased, or unethical
patterns in the data. Such patterns lead to biased predictions based on
so-called sensitive attributes, such as the gender or age of process
participants. Previous work has identified this problem and offered solutions
that mitigate biases by removing sensitive attributes entirely from the process
instance. However, sensitive attributes can be used both fairly and unfairly in
the same process instance. For example, during a medical process, treatment
decisions could be based on gender, while the decision to accept a patient
should not be based on gender. This paper proposes a novel, model-agnostic
approach for identifying and rectifying biased decisions in predictive business
process monitoring models, even when the same sensitive attribute is used both
fairly and unfairly. The proposed approach uses a human-in-the-loop approach to
differentiate between fair and unfair decisions through simple alterations on a
decision tree model distilled from the original prediction model. Our results
show that the proposed approach achieves a promising tradeoff between fairness
and accuracy in the presence of biased data. All source code and data are

### [453] [Multimodal Representation Learning Conditioned on Semantic Relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17497)
*Yang Qiao,Yuntong Hu,Liang Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了RCML框架，通过自然语言关系描述指导多模态表示学习，解决了传统对比学习中语义关系利用不足、缺乏上下文对齐和模态内一致性支持有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态对比学习模型（如CLIP）存在三个主要局限：1）主要关注图像-文本对，未能充分利用不同对之间的语义关系；2）直接匹配全局嵌入而缺乏上下文化，忽略了特定子空间或关系维度的语义对齐需求；3）强调跨模态对比，对模态内一致性的支持有限。

Method: 提出关系条件多模态学习（RCML）框架：1）构建由语义关系连接的多样化训练对；2）引入关系引导的交叉注意力机制，在每种关系上下文中调节多模态表示；3）结合跨模态和模态内对比损失，促进跨模态和语义相关样本的一致性。

Result: 在不同数据集上的实验表明，RCML在检索和分类任务上均持续优于强基线模型，证明了利用语义关系指导多模态表示学习的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模语义关系并引入关系引导的注意力机制，RCML框架显著提升了多模态表示学习的性能，为更细粒度的语义对齐提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning has advanced rapidly with contrastive
models such as CLIP, which align image-text pairs in a shared embedding space.
However, these models face limitations: (1) they typically focus on image-text
pairs, underutilizing the semantic relations across different pairs. (2) they
directly match global embeddings without contextualization, overlooking the
need for semantic alignment along specific subspaces or relational dimensions;
and (3) they emphasize cross-modal contrast, with limited support for
intra-modal consistency. To address these issues, we propose
Relation-Conditioned Multimodal Learning RCML, a framework that learns
multimodal representations under natural-language relation descriptions to
guide both feature extraction and alignment. Our approach constructs
many-to-many training pairs linked by semantic relations and introduces a
relation-guided cross-attention mechanism that modulates multimodal
representations under each relation context. The training objective combines
inter-modal and intra-modal contrastive losses, encouraging consistency across
both modalities and semantically related samples. Experiments on different
datasets show that RCML consistently outperforms strong baselines on both
retrieval and classification tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of
leveraging semantic relations to guide multimodal representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将DLNs从表格数据领域扩展到时间序列分类(TSC)领域，探索DLNs在新领域保持准确性、可解释性和计算效率的能力。

Method: 使用Catch22和TSFresh特征提取方法将时间序列转换为向量表示，采用联合超参数搜索策略优化DLN训练配置，而非传统的孤立消融实验方法。

Result: 在51个公开单变量TSC基准测试中，DLNs保持了竞争性的准确率、低推理成本和透明的可解释决策逻辑，与之前在表格分类和回归任务中的发现一致。

Conclusion: DLNs成功应用于时间序列分类领域，保持了其核心优势，为时间序列分析提供了准确、高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Differentiable logic networks (DLNs) have shown promising results in tabular
domains by combining accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency.
In this work, we apply DLNs to the domain of TSC for the first time, focusing
on univariate datasets. To enable DLN application in this context, we adopt
feature-based representations relying on Catch22 and TSFresh, converting
sequential time series into vectorized forms suitable for DLN classification.
Unlike prior DLN studies that fix the training configuration and vary various
settings in isolation via ablation, we integrate all such configurations into
the hyperparameter search space, enabling the search process to select jointly
optimal settings. We then analyze the distribution of selected configurations
to better understand DLN training dynamics. We evaluate our approach on 51
publicly available univariate TSC benchmarks. The results confirm that
classification DLNs maintain their core strengths in this new domain: they
deliver competitive accuracy, retain low inference cost, and provide
transparent, interpretable decision logic, thus aligning well with previous DLN
findings in the realm of tabular classification and regression tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE模型需要复杂的训练过程（包括主预测损失和辅助负载均衡损失）以及精细的路由/温度调优，这阻碍了实际应用。需要一种简化训练过程并能有效处理长短时域预测的方法。

Method: 结合稀疏MoE计算与新型注意力启发式门控机制，替代传统的单层softmax路由器。该设计自然促进专家平衡利用，无需传统MoE实现中的辅助负载均衡损失。

Result: 模型在仅使用最先进transformer模型（如PatchTST）所需参数的一小部分的情况下实现了更好的性能。在多样化数据集上的实验证实，该MoE架构比LSTM在长短时预测上都更计算高效。

Conclusion: 该方法在精度和计算效率都至关重要的实际时间序列预测应用中具有巨大潜力，能够实现成本效益高的推理。

Abstract: Accurate univariate forecasting remains a pressing need in real-world
systems, such as energy markets, hydrology, retail demand, and IoT monitoring,
where signals are often intermittent and horizons span both short- and
long-term. While transformers and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are
increasingly favored for time-series forecasting, a key gap persists: MoE
models typically require complicated training with both the main forecasting
loss and auxiliary load-balancing losses, along with careful
routing/temperature tuning, which hinders practical adoption. In this paper, we
propose a model architecture that simplifies the training process for
univariate time series forecasting and effectively addresses both long- and
short-term horizons, including intermittent patterns. Our approach combines
sparse MoE computation with a novel attention-inspired gating mechanism that
replaces the traditional one-layer softmax router. Through extensive empirical
evaluation, we demonstrate that our gating design naturally promotes balanced
expert utilization and achieves superior predictive accuracy without requiring
the auxiliary load-balancing losses typically used in classical MoE
implementations. The model achieves better performance while utilizing only a
fraction of the parameters required by state-of-the-art transformer models,
such as PatchTST. Furthermore, experiments across diverse datasets confirm that
our MoE architecture with the proposed gating mechanism is more computationally
efficient than LSTM for both long- and short-term forecasting, enabling
cost-effective inference. These results highlight the potential of our approach
for practical time-series forecasting applications where both accuracy and
computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Handling missing data in time series classification remains a significant
challenge in various domains. Traditional methods often rely on imputation,
which may introduce bias or fail to capture the underlying temporal dynamics.
In this paper, we propose TANDEM (Temporal Attention-guided Neural Differential
Equations for Missingness), an attention-guided neural differential equation
framework that effectively classifies time series data with missing values. Our
approach integrates raw observation, interpolated control path, and continuous
latent dynamics through a novel attention mechanism, allowing the model to
focus on the most informative aspects of the data. We evaluate TANDEM on 30

superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods. Our framework not only
improves classification accuracy but also provides insights into the handling
of missing data, making it a valuable tool in practice.

Conclusion: 神经SDDEs为观测约束下的时间序列分析提供了一个原则性和实用性的工具

Abstract: Astronomical time series from large-scale surveys like LSST are often
irregularly sampled and incomplete, posing challenges for classification and
anomaly detection. We introduce a new framework based on Neural Stochastic
Delay Differential Equations (Neural SDDEs) that combines stochastic modeling
with neural networks to capture delayed temporal dynamics and handle irregular

numerical solver for SDDEs, and mechanisms to robustly learn from noisy, sparse

strong classification accuracy and effective detection of novel astrophysical
events, even with partial labels. This work highlights Neural SDDEs as a
principled and practical tool for time series analysis under observational
constraints.

Conclusion: 基于Gumbel-Softmax的重连方法是一种有效的图结构优化技术，能够显著提升消息传递神经网络的节点分类性能。

Abstract: Graph homophily has been considered an essential property for message-passing
neural networks (MPNN) in node classification. Recent findings suggest that
performance is more closely tied to the consistency of neighborhood class
distributions. We demonstrate that the MPNN performance depends on the number
of components of the overall neighborhood distribution within a class. By
breaking down the classes into their neighborhood distribution components, we
increase measures of neighborhood distribution informativeness but do not
observe an improvement in MPNN performance. We propose a Gumbel-Softmax-based
rewiring method that reduces deviations in neighborhood distributions. Our
results show that our new method enhances neighborhood informativeness, handles
long-range dependencies, mitigates oversquashing, and increases the
classification performance of the MPNN. The code is available at

Motivation: 理解特征在残差流中的流动机制对于提高模型安全性、实现错误早期检测和修正具有重要意义，但目前这一动态过程研究不足。

Method: 提出激活传输算子(ATO)，通过上游到下游残差的线性映射，使用下游SAE解码器投影在特征空间中进行评估，并开发传输效率概念来量化线性传输。

Result: 经验证明ATO能够有效识别特征的线性传输来源，提供了传输效率的上界估计，并确定了残差流中参与线性传输的子空间大小。

Conclusion: 这种计算轻量(无需微调，<50 GPU小时)的方法为模型安全、调试提供了实用工具，并更清晰地揭示了LLM中线性计算的行为模式。

Abstract: The residual stream mediates communication between transformer decoder layers
via linear reads and writes of non-linear computations. While sparse-dictionary
learning-based methods locate features in the residual stream, and activation
patching methods discover circuits within the model, the mechanism by which
features flow through the residual stream remains understudied. Understanding
this dynamic can better inform jailbreaking protections, enable early detection
of model mistakes, and their correction. In this work, we propose Activation
Transport Operators (ATO), linear maps from upstream to downstream residuals
$k$ layers later, evaluated in feature space using downstream SAE decoder
projections. We empirically demonstrate that these operators can determine
whether a feature has been linearly transported from a previous layer or
synthesised from non-linear layer computation. We develop the notion of
transport efficiency, for which we provide an upper bound, and use it to
estimate the size of the residual stream subspace that corresponds to linear
transport. We empirically demonstrate the linear transport, report transport
efficiency and the size of the residual stream's subspace involved in linear
transport. This compute-light (no finetuning, <50 GPU-h) method offers
practical tools for safety, debugging, and a clearer picture of where
computation in LLMs behaves linearly.

Motivation: 探索Transformer模型通过上下文提示学习算法的能力，建立上下文学习与算法模拟之间的直接联系，揭示GPT类基础模型仅通过提示即可切换算法的机制

Method: 构造特定提示将算法参数编码到token表示中，创建尖锐的点积间隙，迫使softmax注意力遵循预定计算。使用两层softmax注意力模块，无需前馈层和参数更新

Result: 对于任何可由固定权重注意力头实现的算法，都存在一个提示能够驱动两层注意力模块以任意精度重现算法输出，甚至单头注意力层也能实现（可能需要更长的提示）

Conclusion: 这些发现建立了上下文学习与算法模拟的直接联系，为大型Transformer作为提示可编程算法库提供了简单机制，揭示了现代Transformer模型的算法通用性

Abstract: We prove that a minimal Transformer architecture with frozen weights is
capable of emulating a broad class of algorithms by in-context prompting. In
particular, for any algorithm implementable by a fixed-weight attention head
(e.g. one-step gradient descent or linear/ridge regression), there exists a
prompt that drives a two-layer softmax attention module to reproduce the
algorithm's output with arbitrary precision. This guarantee extends even to a
single-head attention layer (using longer prompts if necessary), achieving
architectural minimality. Our key idea is to construct prompts that encode an
algorithm's parameters into token representations, creating sharp dot-product
gaps that force the softmax attention to follow the intended computation. This
construction requires no feed-forward layers and no parameter updates. All
adaptation happens through the prompt alone. These findings forge a direct link
between in-context learning and algorithmic emulation, and offer a simple
mechanism for large Transformers to serve as prompt-programmable libraries of
algorithms. They illuminate how GPT-style foundation models may swap algorithms
via prompts alone, establishing a form of algorithmic universality in modern
Transformer models.

Conclusion: S²G-Net为多模态临床数据的ICU住院时间预测提供了有效且可扩展的解决方案，消融研究和可解释性分析证明了各组件的重要性和图构建的重要性

Abstract: Predicting a patient's length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU)
is a critical task for hospital resource management, yet remains challenging
due to the heterogeneous and irregularly sampled nature of electronic health
records (EHRs). In this work, we propose S$^2$G-Net, a novel neural
architecture that unifies state-space sequence modeling with multi-view Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) for ICU LOS prediction. The temporal path employs Mamba
state-space models (SSMs) to capture patient trajectories, while the graph path
leverages an optimized GraphGPS backbone, designed to integrate heterogeneous
patient similarity graphs derived from diagnostic, administrative, and semantic
features. Experiments on the large-scale MIMIC-IV cohort dataset show that
S$^2$G-Net consistently outperforms sequence models (BiLSTM, Mamba,
Transformer), graph models (classic GNNs, GraphGPS), and hybrid approaches
across all primary metrics. Extensive ablation studies and interpretability
analyses highlight the complementary contributions of each component of our
architecture and underscore the importance of principled graph construction.
These results demonstrate that S$^2$G-Net provides an effective and scalable
solution for ICU LOS prediction with multi-modal clinical data.

Result: 研究发现：1) 自定义LoRA/DoRA配置结合AMP显著提升训练效率；2) 小模型梯度更新同样具有低秩特性，rank 1分解几乎不影响性能；3) 成功训练出能同时执行情感分析、复述检测和相似度评分的多任务模型。

Conclusion: LoRA和DoRA等高效微调方法不仅适用于大模型，在小模型上同样有效，为资源有限的研究团队提供了可行的解决方案，同时验证了语言模型梯度更新的低秩特性具有普适性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial
intelligence, fine-tuning LLMs is extraordinarily computationally expensive,
preventing smaller businesses and research teams with limited GPU resources
from engaging with new research. Hu et al and Liu et al introduce Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) and Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) as highly
efficient and performant solutions to the computational challenges of LLM
fine-tuning, demonstrating huge speedups and memory usage savings for models
such as GPT-3 and RoBERTa. We seek to expand upon the original LoRA and DoRA
papers by benchmarking efficiency and performance of LoRA and DoRA when applied
to a much smaller scale of language model: our case study here is the compact
minBERT model. Our findings reveal that optimal custom configurations of LoRA
and DoRA, coupled with Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP), significantly enhance
training efficiency without compromising performance. Furthermore, while the
parameterization of minBERT is significantly smaller than GPT-3, our results
validate the observation that gradient updates to language models are
inherently low-rank even in small model space, observing that rank 1
decompositions yield negligible performance deficits. Furthermore, aided by our
highly efficient minBERT implementation, we investigate numerous architectures,
custom loss functions, and hyperparameters to ultimately train an optimal
ensembled multitask minBERT model to simultaneously perform sentiment analysis,
paraphrase detection, and similarity scoring.

Conclusion: 通过结合真实世界图表数据集和考虑多模态特征的图表相似性奖励，本文方法有效提升了图表到代码生成的质量和视觉一致性，为该领域提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: The chart-to-code generation task requires MLLMs to convert chart images into
executable code. This task faces two major challenges: limited data diversity
and insufficient maintenance of visual consistency between generated and
original charts during training. Existing datasets mainly rely on seed data to
prompt GPT models for code generation, resulting in homogeneous samples. To
address this, we propose ReChartPrompt, which leverages real-world,
human-designed charts from arXiv papers as prompts instead of synthetic seeds.
Using the diverse styles and rich content of arXiv charts, we construct
ReChartPrompt-240K, a large-scale and highly diverse dataset. Another challenge
is that although SFT effectively improve code understanding, it often fails to
ensure that generated charts are visually consistent with the originals. To
address this, we propose ChartSimRL, a GRPO-based reinforcement learning
algorithm guided by a novel chart similarity reward. This reward consists of
attribute similarity, which measures the overlap of chart attributes such as
layout and color between the generated and original charts, and visual
similarity, which assesses similarity in texture and other overall visual
features using convolutional neural networks. Unlike traditional text-based
rewards such as accuracy or format rewards, our reward considers the multimodal
nature of the chart-to-code task and effectively enhances the model's ability
to accurately reproduce charts. By integrating ReChartPrompt and ChartSimRL, we
develop the ChartMaster model, which achieves state-of-the-art results among
7B-parameter models and even rivals GPT-4o on various chart-to-code generation
benchmarks. All resources are available at

Motivation: 现有SGD-LFA方法仅依赖当前样本的瞬时梯度信息，缺乏历史迭代经验知识的积累和样本间内在关联的考虑，导致收敛速度慢和泛化性能不佳

Method: 开发PI加速的SGD算法，通过比例-积分控制机制整合相关实例并优化学习误差，同时利用当前和历史信息

Result: 对比实验证明PILF模型在高维稀疏矩阵上具有优越的表征能力

Conclusion: PILF模型通过PI控制机制有效解决了传统SGD-LFA方法的局限性，显著提升了收敛速度和泛化性能

Abstract: In industrial big data scenarios, high-dimensional sparse matrices (HDI) are
widely used to characterize high-order interaction relationships among massive
nodes. The stochastic gradient descent-based latent factor analysis (SGD-LFA)
method can effectively extract deep feature information embedded in HDI
matrices. However, existing SGD-LFA methods exhibit significant limitations:
their parameter update process relies solely on the instantaneous gradient
information of current samples, failing to incorporate accumulated experiential
knowledge from historical iterations or account for intrinsic correlations
between samples, resulting in slow convergence speed and suboptimal
generalization performance. Thus, this paper proposes a PILF model by
developing a PI-accelerated SGD algorithm by integrating correlated instances
and refining learning errors through proportional-integral (PI) control
mechanism that current and historical information; Comparative experiments
demonstrate the superior representation capability of the PILF model on HDI
matrices

Conclusion: QGAT展示了量子增强学习在化学、生物和网络分析等领域的可扩展潜力，其模块化设计便于集成到现有架构中

Abstract: We propose the Quantum Graph Attention Network (QGAT), a hybrid graph neural
network that integrates variational quantum circuits into the attention
mechanism. At its core, QGAT employs strongly entangling quantum circuits with
amplitude-encoded node features to enable expressive nonlinear interactions.
Distinct from classical multi-head attention that separately computes each
head, QGAT leverages a single quantum circuit to simultaneously generate
multiple attention coefficients. This quantum parallelism facilitates parameter
sharing across heads, substantially reducing computational overhead and model
complexity. Classical projection weights and quantum circuit parameters are
optimized jointly in an end-to-end manner, ensuring flexible adaptation to
learning tasks. Empirical results demonstrate QGAT's effectiveness in capturing
complex structural dependencies and improved generalization in inductive
scenarios, highlighting its potential for scalable quantum-enhanced learning
across domains such as chemistry, biology, and network analysis. Furthermore,
experiments confirm that quantum embedding enhances robustness against feature
and structural noise, suggesting advantages in handling real-world noisy data.
The modularity of QGAT also ensures straightforward integration into existing
architectures, allowing it to easily augment classical attention-based models.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation represents a significant advancement in boosting
the performance of machine learning (ML) models, particularly in fields where
data acquisition is challenging, such as echocardiography. The acquisition and
labeling of echocardiograms (echo) for heart assessment, crucial in
point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) settings, often encounter limitations due to
the restricted number of echo views available, typically captured by operators
with varying levels of experience. This study proposes a novel approach for
enhancing clinical diagnosis accuracy by synthetically generating echo views.
These views are conditioned on existing, real views of the heart, focusing
specifically on the estimation of ejection fraction (EF), a critical parameter
traditionally measured from biplane apical views. By integrating a conditional
generative model, we demonstrate an improvement in EF estimation accuracy,
providing a comparative analysis with traditional methods. Preliminary results
indicate that our synthetic echoes, when used to augment existing datasets, not
only enhance EF estimation but also show potential in advancing the development
of more robust, accurate, and clinically relevant ML models. This approach is
anticipated to catalyze further research in synthetic data applications, paving
the way for innovative solutions in medical imaging diagnostics.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that remains
challenging to predict due to its multifactorial etiology and the complexity of
multimodal clinical data. Accurate forecasting of clinically relevant
biomarkers, including diagnostic and quantitative measures, is essential for
effective monitoring of disease progression. This work introduces L2C-TabPFN, a
method that integrates a longitudinal-to-cross-sectional (L2C) transformation
with a pre-trained Tabular Foundation Model (TabPFN) to predict Alzheimer's
disease outcomes using the TADPOLE dataset. L2C-TabPFN converts sequential
patient records into fixed-length feature vectors, enabling robust prediction
of diagnosis, cognitive scores, and ventricular volume. Experimental results
demonstrate that, while L2C-TabPFN achieves competitive performance on
diagnostic and cognitive outcomes, it provides state-of-the-art results in
ventricular volume prediction. This key imaging biomarker reflects
neurodegeneration and progression in Alzheimer's disease. These findings
highlight the potential of tabular foundational models for advancing
longitudinal prediction of clinically relevant imaging markers in Alzheimer's
disease.

Conclusion: 该方法为异构域共现数据的可视化探索提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够直观展示不对称关系并保持数据的统计依赖性。

Abstract: This paper proposes an embedding method for co-occurrence data aimed at
visual information exploration. We consider cases where co-occurrence
probabilities are measured between pairs of elements from heterogeneous
domains. The proposed method maps these heterogeneous elements into
corresponding two-dimensional latent spaces, enabling visualization of
asymmetric relationships between the domains. The key idea is to embed the
elements in a way that maximizes their mutual information, thereby preserving
the original dependency structure as much as possible. This approach can be
naturally extended to cases involving three or more domains, using a
generalization of mutual information known as total correlation. For
inter-domain analysis, we also propose a visualization method that assigns
colors to the latent spaces based on conditional probabilities, allowing users
to explore asymmetric relationships interactively. We demonstrate the utility
of the method through applications to an adjective-noun dataset, the NeurIPS
dataset, and a subject-verb-object dataset, showcasing both intra- and
inter-domain analysis.

Result: 高级提示策略生成的合成响应能更有效地区分诊断组并捕捉人口统计多样性。优质模型生成的响应具有更高的真实性和多样性。BERTScore是上下文相似性评估的最可靠指标，而BLEU对创意输出的评估效果较差。LLM-as-a-judge方法提供了有前景的初步验证结果。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过精炼的提示方法指导的生成式多模态大语言模型可以可行地生成现有认知测试的稳健合成规范数据，为开发新型图像认知测试奠定了基础，克服了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Cognitive assessments require normative data as essential benchmarks for
evaluating individual performance. Hence, developing new cognitive tests based
on novel image stimuli is challenging due to the lack of readily available
normative data. Traditional data collection methods are costly, time-consuming,
and infrequently updated, limiting their practical utility. Recent advancements
in generative multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a new approach to
generate synthetic normative data from existing cognitive test images. We
investigated the feasibility of using MLLMs, specifically GPT-4o and
GPT-4o-mini, to synthesize normative textual responses for established
image-based cognitive assessments, such as the "Cookie Theft" picture
description task. Two distinct prompting strategies-naive prompts with basic
instructions and advanced prompts enriched with contextual guidance-were
evaluated. Responses were analyzed using embeddings to assess their capacity to
distinguish diagnostic groups and demographic variations. Performance metrics
included BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Advanced
prompting strategies produced synthetic responses that more effectively
distinguished between diagnostic groups and captured demographic diversity
compared to naive prompts. Superior models generated responses exhibiting
higher realism and diversity. BERTScore emerged as the most reliable metric for
contextual similarity assessment, while BLEU was less effective for evaluating
creative outputs. The LLM-as-a-judge approach provided promising preliminary
validation results. Our study demonstrates that generative multimodal LLMs,
guided by refined prompting methods, can feasibly generate robust synthetic
normative data for existing cognitive tests, thereby laying the groundwork for
developing novel image-based cognitive assessments without the traditional
limitations.

TL;DR: TiKMiX是一种动态调整语言模型预训练数据混合比例的方法，通过Group Influence指标高效评估数据域对模型的影响，相比静态混合策略显著提升性能并减少计算资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态数据混合策略在语言模型预训练中效果不佳，因为模型对不同数据域的学习偏好会随训练过程动态变化，但高效观测这些变化偏好存在挑战。

Method: 提出Group Influence指标评估数据域影响，将数据混合问题转化为寻找最优影响力最大化分布的问题，开发了TiKMiX-D直接优化方法和TiKMiX-M回归预测方法。

Result: TiKMiX-D仅用20%计算资源就超越了REGMIX等先进方法，TiKMiX-M在9个下游基准测试中平均性能提升2%，模型在1万亿token规模上训练验证。

Conclusion: 模型的数据偏好随训练进度和规模动态演变，基于Group Influence动态调整数据混合比例能显著提升性能，有效缓解静态比例导致的数据消化不足问题。

Abstract: The data mixture used in the pre-training of a language model is a
cornerstone of its final performance. However, a static mixing strategy is
suboptimal, as the model's learning preferences for various data domains shift
dynamically throughout training. Crucially, observing these evolving
preferences in a computationally efficient manner remains a significant
challenge. To address this, we propose TiKMiX, a method that dynamically
adjusts the data mixture according to the model's evolving preferences. TiKMiX
introduces Group Influence, an efficient metric for evaluating the impact of
data domains on the model. This metric enables the formulation of the data
mixing problem as a search for an optimal, influence-maximizing distribution.
We solve this via two approaches: TiKMiX-D for direct optimization, and
TiKMiX-M, which uses a regression model to predict a superior mixture. We
trained models with different numbers of parameters, on up to 1 trillion
tokens. TiKMiX-D exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods like
REGMIX while using just 20% of the computational resources. TiKMiX-M leads to
an average performance gain of 2% across 9 downstream benchmarks. Our
experiments reveal that a model's data preferences evolve with training
progress and scale, and we demonstrate that dynamically adjusting the data
mixture based on Group Influence, a direct measure of these preferences,
significantly improves performance by mitigating the underdigestion of data
seen with static ratios.

Result: 揭示了Mamba SSM在GPU上的运行特征，识别了性能瓶颈和优化机会

Conclusion: 为GPU微架构设计提供了重要见解，指出了继续提升此类模型性能的潜在优化方向

Abstract: Mamba-based State Space Models (SSM) have emerged as a promising alternative
to the ubiquitous transformers. Despite the expressive power of transformers,
the quadratic complexity of computing attention is a major impediment to
scaling performance as we increase the sequence length. SSMs provide an
alternative path that addresses this problem, reducing the computational
complexity requirements of self-attention with novel model architectures for
different domains and fields such as video, text generation and graphs. Thus,
it is important to characterize the behavior of these emerging workloads on
GPUs and understand their requirements during GPU microarchitectural design. In
this work we evaluate Mamba-based SSMs and characterize their behavior during
training on GPUs. We construct a workload suite that offers representative
models that span different model architectures. We then use this suite to
analyze the architectural implications of running Mamba-based SSMs on GPUs. Our
work sheds new light on potential optimizations to continue scaling the
performance for such models.

Conclusion: 该方法在不同骨干架构和大规模对抗训练中均表现出有效性，为构建更可信的基础模型提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) with projected gradient descent is the most popular
method to improve model robustness under adversarial attacks. However,
computational overheads become prohibitively large when AT is applied to large
backbone models. AT is also known to have the issue of robust overfitting. This
paper contributes to solving both problems simultaneously towards building more
trustworthy foundation models. In particular, we propose a new adapter-based
approach for efficient AT directly in the feature space. We show that the
proposed adapter-based approach can improve the inner-loop convergence quality
by eliminating robust overfitting. As a result, it significantly increases
computational efficiency and improves model accuracy by generalizing
adversarial robustness to unseen attacks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
the new adapter-based approach in different backbone architectures and in AT at
scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因为AI在科学中的作用引发了认知论疑问：LLM是否真正能够产生新知识，还是仅仅重新组合记忆的内容。需要一种可验证的方法来区分真正的生成能力与简单的记忆重现。

Method: 提出了"unlearning-as-ablation"方法：系统性删除目标结果及其忘记闭包（包括引理、反义表达和多跳含义），然后评估模型是否能够仅从允许的公理和工具重新推导出该结果。

Result: 成功重新推导能够提供真正生成能力的证据，失败则曝露了当前的限制。这种方法可以作为新一代测试标准，像ImageNet推动视觉进步一样推动AI科学发现。

Conclusion: 无论模型成功还是失败，unlearning-as-ablation都提供了一个有理论基础的框架来映射AI科学发现的真实范围和限制，为评估AI在科学中的真正能力提供了新的认知工具。

Abstract: Bold claims about AI's role in science-from "AGI will cure all diseases" to
promises of radically accelerated discovery-raise a central epistemic question:
do large language models (LLMs) truly generate new knowledge, or do they merely
remix memorized fragments? We propose unlearning-as-ablation as a falsifiable
test of constructive scientific discovery. The method systematically removes a
target result and its entire forget-closure (lemmas, paraphrases, and multi-hop
entailments) and then evaluates whether the model can re-derive the result from
only permitted axioms and tools. Success provides evidence for genuine
generative capability; failure exposes current limits. Unlike prevailing
motivations for unlearning-privacy, copyright, or safety-our framing
repositions it as an epistemic probe for AI-for-Science. We argue that such
tests could serve as the next generation of benchmarks, much as ImageNet
catalyzed progress in vision: distinguishing models that can merely recall from
those that can constructively generate new scientific knowledge. We outline a
minimal pilot in mathematics and algorithms, and discuss extensions to physics,
chemistry, and biology. Whether models succeed or fail, unlearning-as-ablation
provides a principled framework to map the true reach and limits of AI
scientific discovery. This is a position paper: we advance a conceptual and
methodological argument rather than new empirical results.

Abstract: When do diffusion models reproduce their training data, and when are they
able to generate samples beyond it? A practically relevant theoretical
understanding of this interplay between memorization and generalization may
significantly impact real-world deployments of diffusion models with respect to
issues such as copyright infringement and data privacy. In this work, to
disentangle the different factors that influence memorization and
generalization in practical diffusion models, we introduce a scientific and
mathematical "laboratory" for investigating these phenomena in diffusion models
trained on fully synthetic or natural image-like structured data. Within this
setting, we hypothesize that the memorization or generalization behavior of an
underparameterized trained model is determined by the difference in training
loss between an associated memorizing model and a generalizing model. To probe
this hypothesis, we theoretically characterize a crossover point wherein the
weighted training loss of a fully generalizing model becomes greater than that
of an underparameterized memorizing model at a critical value of model
(under)parameterization. We then demonstrate via carefully-designed experiments
that the location of this crossover predicts a phase transition in diffusion
models trained via gradient descent, validating our hypothesis. Ultimately, our
theory enables us to analytically predict the model size at which memorization
becomes predominant. Our work provides an analytically tractable and
practically meaningful setting for future theoretical and empirical
investigations. Code for our experiments is available at

Conclusion: 空中计算模型训练是联邦学习在大规模客户端网络中可行的有效方法，理论见解通过广泛的实验评估得到进一步证实

Abstract: Federated learning facilitates collaborative model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy. However, its performance is often
constrained by limited communication resources, particularly in systems
supporting a large number of clients. To address this challenge, integrating
over-the-air computations into the training process has emerged as a promising
solution to alleviate communication bottlenecks. The system significantly
increases the number of clients it can support in each communication round by
transmitting intermediate parameters via analog signals rather than digital
ones. This improvement, however, comes at the cost of channel-induced
distortions, such as fading and noise, which affect the aggregated global
parameters. To elucidate these effects, this paper develops a theoretical
framework to analyze the performance of over-the-air federated learning in
large-scale client scenarios. Our analysis reveals three key advantages of
scaling up the number of participating clients: (1) Enhanced Privacy: The
mutual information between a client's local gradient and the server's
aggregated gradient diminishes, effectively reducing privacy leakage. (2)
Mitigation of Channel Fading: The channel hardening effect eliminates the
impact of small-scale fading in the noisy global gradient. (3) Improved
Convergence: Reduced thermal noise and gradient estimation errors benefit the
convergence rate. These findings solidify over-the-air model training as a
viable approach for federated learning in networks with a large number of
clients. The theoretical insights are further substantiated through extensive
experimental evaluations.

Conclusion: 提出的自适应集成学习与高斯Copula模型能有效处理稀疏数据下的负荷预测问题

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is capable of accurate Load Forecasting from complete
data. However, there are many uncertainties that affect data collection,
leading to sparsity. This article proposed a model called Adaptive Ensemble
Learning with Gaussian Copula to deal with sparsity, which contains three
modules: data complementation, ML construction, and adaptive ensemble. First,
it applies Gaussian Copula to eliminate sparsity. Then, we utilise five ML
models to make predictions individually. Finally, it employs adaptive ensemble
to get final weighted-sum result. Experiments have demonstrated that our model
are robust.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) revolutionizes molecule generation in
bioengineering and biological research, significantly accelerating discovery
processes. However, this advancement introduces critical concerns regarding
intellectual property protection. To address these challenges, we propose the
first robust watermarking method designed for molecules, which utilizes
atom-level features to preserve molecular integrity and invariant features to
ensure robustness against affine transformations. Comprehensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our method using the datasets QM9 and GEOM-DRUG,
and generative models GeoBFN and GeoLDM. We demonstrate the feasibility of
embedding watermarks, maintaining basic properties higher than 90.00\% while
achieving watermark accuracy greater than 95.00\%. Furthermore, downstream
docking simulations reveal comparable performance between original and
watermarked molecules, with binding affinities reaching -6.00 kcal/mol and root
mean square deviations below 1.602 \AA. These results confirm that our
watermarking technique effectively safeguards molecular intellectual property
without compromising scientific utility, enabling secure and responsible AI
integration in molecular discovery and research applications.

Motivation: 尽管已经对大型语言模型进行了广泛的对齐工作，但越狱攻击仍然不断出现，需要在不增加大量资源消耗的情况下增强模型的安全性

Method: 使用推测采样技术，假设存在一个具有所需安全属性的小模型，通过计算小模型和复合模型的匹配比例来量化越狱风险，动态切换解码方案

Result: 实验结果显示SSD成功为大模型赋予了所需的安全属性，同时保持对良性查询的有用性，并且由于推测采样设计还加速了推理时间

Conclusion: SSD提供了一种有效的解码时安全增强方法，能够在保持实用性的同时防御越狱攻击，并提高推理效率

Abstract: Despite extensive efforts to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
values and safety rules, jailbreak attacks that exploit certain vulnerabilities
continuously emerge, highlighting the need to strengthen existing LLMs with
additional safety properties to defend against these attacks. However, tuning
large models has become increasingly resource-intensive and may have difficulty
ensuring consistent performance. We introduce Speculative Safety-Aware Decoding
(SSD), a lightweight decoding-time approach that equips LLMs with the desired
safety property while accelerating inference. We assume that there exists a
small language model that possesses this desired property. SSD integrates
speculative sampling during decoding and leverages the match ratio between the
small and composite models to quantify jailbreak risks. This enables SSD to
dynamically switch between decoding schemes to prioritize utility or safety, to
handle the challenge of different model capacities. The output token is then
sampled from a new distribution that combines the distributions of the original
and the small models. Experimental results show that SSD successfully equips
the large model with the desired safety property, and also allows the model to
remain helpful to benign queries. Furthermore, SSD accelerates the inference
time, thanks to the speculative sampling design.

*Sotaro Takeshita,Yurina Takeshita,Daniel Ruffinelli,Simone Paolo Ponzetto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现随机截断文本嵌入向量高达50%的维度只会导致性能轻微下降（<10%），这与先前研究认为的表示空间利用不足不同，而是因为大量均匀分布的维度在被移除时反而能提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究文本嵌入向量截断对下游任务性能的影响，探索使用更小尺寸嵌入向量的好处以及文本编码的潜在洞察。

Method: 在6个最先进的文本编码器和26个下游任务上进行实验，随机移除最多50%的嵌入维度，并分析性能变化。

Result: 截断50%的嵌入维度仅导致检索和分类任务性能下降不到10%，且发现大量均匀分布的维度在被移除时反而能提高性能。

Conclusion: 这种现象不仅限于分类或检索任务，在大语言模型的生成任务中也观察到类似现象，表明嵌入向量中存在大量冗余维度。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the surprising impact that truncating text embeddings
has on downstream performance. We consistently observe across 6
state-of-the-art text encoders and 26 downstream tasks, that randomly removing
up to 50% of embedding dimensions results in only a minor drop in performance,
less than 10%, in retrieval and classification tasks. Given the benefits of
using smaller-sized embeddings, as well as the potential insights about text
encoding, we study this phenomenon and find that, contrary to what is suggested
in prior work, this is not the result of an ineffective use of representation
space. Instead, we find that a large number of uniformly distributed dimensions
actually cause an increase in performance when removed. This would explain why,
on average, removing a large number of embedding dimensions results in a
marginal drop in performance. We make similar observations when truncating the
embeddings used by large language models to make next-token predictions on
generative tasks, suggesting that this phenomenon is not isolated to
classification or retrieval tasks.

TL;DR: MANGO是一个新颖的分层强化学习框架，通过多层抽象和嵌套选项来解决长期稀疏奖励环境中的挑战，显著提高了样本效率和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂任务中长期稀疏奖励环境带来的挑战，传统RL方法在这些环境中样本效率低且泛化能力差。

Method: 将复杂任务分解为多层抽象空间，每层定义抽象状态空间并使用选项将轨迹模块化为宏动作，通过嵌套选项实现学习动作的复用，包含层内策略和任务动作。

Result: 在程序生成的网格环境中实验显示，相比标准RL方法，在样本效率和泛化能力方面都有显著提升，同时提高了决策过程的可解释性。

Conclusion: MANGO框架有效解决了长期稀疏奖励问题，未来将探索自动抽象发现、连续环境适应和更鲁棒的多层训练策略。

Abstract: This paper introduces MANGO (Multilayer Abstraction for Nested Generation of
Options), a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework designed to
address the challenges of long-term sparse reward environments. MANGO
decomposes complex tasks into multiple layers of abstraction, where each layer
defines an abstract state space and employs options to modularize trajectories
into macro-actions. These options are nested across layers, allowing for
efficient reuse of learned movements and improved sample efficiency. The
framework introduces intra-layer policies that guide the agent's transitions
within the abstract state space, and task actions that integrate task-specific
components such as reward functions. Experiments conducted in
procedurally-generated grid environments demonstrate substantial improvements
in both sample efficiency and generalization capabilities compared to standard
RL methods. MANGO also enhances interpretability by making the agent's
decision-making process transparent across layers, which is particularly
valuable in safety-critical and industrial applications. Future work will
explore automated discovery of abstractions and abstract actions, adaptation to
continuous or fuzzy environments, and more robust multi-layer training
strategies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有标准分辨率平台生成超高清视频面临重新训练需求高、计算和内存成本巨大的挑战，需要高效解决方案。

Method: 采用基于分块的训练免费算法创新，结合自适应区域感知缓存策略和缓存引导的通信最小化分块并行技术。

Result: 在各种基准测试中实现了高性能增益和高输出质量，显著减少了内存占用和计算复杂度。

Conclusion: SuperGen成功解决了超高清视频生成的效率和成本问题，为广泛分辨率范围提供了无需额外训练的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable success in generative
tasks (e.g., image and video generation), and the demand for high-quality
content (e.g., 2K/4K videos) is rapidly increasing across various domains.
However, generating ultra-high-resolution videos on existing
standard-resolution (e.g., 720p) platforms remains challenging due to the
excessive re-training requirements and prohibitively high computational and
memory costs. To this end, we introduce SuperGen, an efficient tile-based
framework for ultra-high-resolution video generation. SuperGen features a novel
training-free algorithmic innovation with tiling to successfully support a wide
range of resolutions without additional training efforts while significantly
reducing both memory footprint and computational complexity. Moreover, SuperGen
incorporates a tile-tailored, adaptive, region-aware caching strategy that
accelerates video generation by exploiting redundancy across denoising steps
and spatial regions. SuperGen also integrates cache-guided,
communication-minimized tile parallelism for enhanced throughput and minimized
latency. Evaluations demonstrate that SuperGen harvests the maximum performance
gains while achieving high output quality across various benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了回归校准指标的不一致性问题，发现不同指标对同一校准结果的评估经常产生冲突甚至矛盾结论，识别出ENCE和CWC为最可靠的指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键应用中，数据驱动模型不仅需要准确，还必须提供可靠的不确定性估计（校准）。然而现有的校准指标在定义、假设和尺度上差异很大，难以跨研究比较结果，且大多数重新校准方法仅使用少量指标进行评估。

Method: 从文献中系统提取和分类回归校准指标，独立于特定建模方法或重新校准方法对这些指标进行基准测试，使用真实世界数据、合成数据和人工失准数据进行受控实验。

Result: 实验表明校准指标经常产生冲突结果：许多指标对同一重新校准结果的评估不一致，有些甚至指示矛盾结论。ENCE（期望归一化校准误差）和CWC（覆盖宽度准则）被确定为测试中最可靠的指标。

Conclusion: 校准研究中指标选择具有关键作用，指标不一致性可能导致通过挑选指标来制造误导性的成功印象，需要谨慎选择可靠的校准评估指标。

Abstract: In safety-critical applications data-driven models must not only be accurate
but also provide reliable uncertainty estimates. This property, commonly
referred to as calibration, is essential for risk-aware decision-making. In
regression a wide variety of calibration metrics and recalibration methods have
emerged. However, these metrics differ significantly in their definitions,
assumptions and scales, making it difficult to interpret and compare results
across studies. Moreover, most recalibration methods have been evaluated using
only a small subset of metrics, leaving it unclear whether improvements
generalize across different notions of calibration. In this work, we
systematically extract and categorize regression calibration metrics from the
literature and benchmark these metrics independently of specific modelling
methods or recalibration approaches. Through controlled experiments with
real-world, synthetic and artificially miscalibrated data, we demonstrate that
calibration metrics frequently produce conflicting results. Our analysis
reveals substantial inconsistencies: many metrics disagree in their evaluation
of the same recalibration result, and some even indicate contradictory
conclusions. This inconsistency is particularly concerning as it potentially
allows cherry-picking of metrics to create misleading impressions of success.
We identify the Expected Normalized Calibration Error (ENCE) and the Coverage
Width-based Criterion (CWC) as the most dependable metrics in our tests. Our
findings highlight the critical role of metric selection in calibration
research.

Motivation: 移动设备硬件异构性增强，现有调度方法局限于单模型场景，忽视硬件/软件配置差异，执行时间估计不准确

Method: 基于遗传算法，使用三种染色体类型进行分区/映射/优先级探索，结合硬件在环分析和评估进行精确执行时间估计

Result: 在9个先进网络的随机场景测试中，Puzzle相比NPU Only和Best Mapping基准方法分别支持3.7倍和2.2倍的平均请求频率提升

Conclusion: 该方法能有效解决多深度学习网络在异构处理器上的调度问题，满足实时性要求的同时显著提升性能

Abstract: As deep learning models are increasingly deployed on mobile devices, modern
mobile devices incorporate deep learning-specific accelerators to handle the
growing computational demands, thus increasing their hardware heterogeneity.
However, existing works on scheduling deep learning workloads across these
processors have significant limitations: most studies focus on single-model
scenarios rather than realistic multi-model scenarios, overlook performance
variations from different hardware/software configurations, and struggle with
accurate execution time estimation. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel genetic algorithm-based methodology for scheduling multiple deep learning
networks on heterogeneous processors by partitioning the networks into multiple
subgraphs. Our approach incorporates three different types of chromosomes for
partition/mapping/priority exploration, and leverages device-in-the-loop
profiling and evaluation for accurate execution time estimation. Based on this
methodology, our system, Puzzle, demonstrates superior performance in extensive
evaluations with randomly generated scenarios involving nine state-of-the-art
networks. The results demonstrate Puzzle can support 3.7 and 2.2 times higher
request frequency on average compared to the two heuristic baselines, NPU Only
and Best Mapping, respectively, while satisfying the equivalent level of
real-time requirements.

Method: 受强化学习中TRPO和PPO启发，将SFT视为具有恒定正优势的策略梯度方法特例，提出PSFT目标函数来约束策略漂移

Result: 在数学和人类价值观领域的实验显示，PSFT在域内性能与SFT相当，域外泛化更优，训练稳定不出现熵崩溃，为后续优化提供更好基础

Conclusion: PSFT通过信任域约束有效解决了SFT的泛化问题，同时保持竞争力并为后续训练阶段留出优化空间

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of foundation models often leads to poor
generalization, where prior capabilities deteriorate after tuning on new tasks
or domains. Inspired by trust-region policy optimization (TRPO) and proximal
policy optimization (PPO) in reinforcement learning (RL), we propose Proximal
SFT (PSFT). This fine-tuning objective incorporates the benefits of
trust-region, effectively constraining policy drift during SFT while
maintaining competitive tuning. By viewing SFT as a special case of policy
gradient methods with constant positive advantages, we derive PSFT that
stabilizes optimization and leads to generalization, while leaving room for
further optimization in subsequent post-training stages. Experiments across
mathematical and human-value domains show that PSFT matches SFT in-domain,
outperforms it in out-of-domain generalization, remains stable under prolonged
training without causing entropy collapse, and provides a stronger foundation
for the subsequent optimization.

Motivation: 研究注意力机制中归一化处理的局限性，特别是softmax缩放对token选择能力和几何分离的影响，为改进注意力架构提供理论依据。

Method: 建立理论框架分析模型选择能力和几何分离，通过预训练GPT-2模型进行实验验证，测量距离边界和分离标准。

Result: 随着选择token数量增加，模型区分信息性token的能力显著下降，趋向均匀选择模式；softmax归一化在低温设置下导致梯度敏感性训练挑战。

Conclusion: 当前softmax注意力机制存在局限性，需要开发更鲁棒的归一化和选择策略来提升注意力架构的性能。

Abstract: This paper investigates the limitations of the normalization in attention
mechanisms. We begin with a theoretical framework that enables the
identification of the model's selective ability and the geometric separation
involved in token selection. Our analysis includes explicit bounds on distances
and separation criteria for token vectors under softmax scaling. Through
experiments with pre-trained GPT-2 model, we empirically validate our
theoretical results and analyze key behaviors of the attention mechanism.
Notably, we demonstrate that as the number of selected tokens increases, the
model's ability to distinguish informative tokens declines, often converging
toward a uniform selection pattern. We also show that gradient sensitivity
under softmax normalization presents challenges during training, especially at
low temperature settings. These findings advance current understanding of
softmax-based attention mechanism and motivate the need for more robust
normalization and selection strategies in future attention architectures.

Motivation: 消息传递神经网络(MPNN)在节点分类任务中表现强大，但在异配性(低同类连接性)和图结构瓶颈下存在性能限制。需要理解异配性和结构瓶颈之间的关系，并提供改进方法。

Method: 提出了统一的统计框架，通过MPNN表示的信噪比(SNR)来分析性能，将模型性能分解为特征相关参数和特征无关敏感度。证明了敏感度受高阶同配性限制，并开发了BRIDGE图重连算法。

Result: 理论分析表明最优图结构是单类和双类二分簇的不相交并集。BRIDGE算法在合成基准测试中实现了近乎完美的分类准确率，在真实世界基准测试中显著改进，特别是在MPNN通常表现不佳的"中等同配性陷阱"区域。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了评估MPNN性能的诊断工具，以及通过原则性图修改来增强性能的简单有效方法。BRIDGE算法超越了文献中的标准重连技术，代码已公开供使用。

Abstract: Message passing neural networks (MPNNs) are powerful models for node
classification but suffer from performance limitations under heterophily (low
same-class connectivity) and structural bottlenecks in the graph. We provide a
unifying statistical framework exposing the relationship between heterophily
and bottlenecks through the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of MPNN
representations. The SNR decomposes model performance into feature-dependent
parameters and feature-independent sensitivities. We prove that the sensitivity
to class-wise signals is bounded by higher-order homophily -- a generalisation
of classical homophily to multi-hop neighbourhoods -- and show that low
higher-order homophily manifests locally as the interaction between structural
bottlenecks and class labels (class-bottlenecks). Through analysis of graph
ensembles, we provide a further quantitative decomposition of bottlenecking
into underreaching (lack of depth implying signals cannot arrive) and
oversquashing (lack of breadth implying signals arriving on fewer paths) with
closed-form expressions. We prove that optimal graph structures for maximising
higher-order homophily are disjoint unions of single-class and
two-class-bipartite clusters. This yields BRIDGE, a graph ensemble-based
rewiring algorithm that achieves near-perfect classification accuracy across
all homophily regimes on synthetic benchmarks and significant improvements on
real-world benchmarks, by eliminating the ``mid-homophily pitfall'' where MPNNs
typically struggle, surpassing current standard rewiring techniques from the
literature. Our framework, whose code we make available for public use,
provides both diagnostic tools for assessing MPNN performance, and simple yet
effective methods for enhancing performance through principled graph
modification.

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在异构网络中部署去中心化RL的强大潜力，为解决分布式RL训练中的网络延迟问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As single-center computing approaches power constraints, decentralized
training is becoming essential. Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training
enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) but faces challenges in heterogeneous
distributed environments due to its tightly-coupled sampling-learning
alternation. We propose HeteroRL, an asynchronous RL architecture that
decouples rollout sampling from parameter learning, enabling robust deployment
across geographically distributed nodes under network delays. We identify that
latency-induced KL divergence causes importance sampling failure due to high
variance. To address this, we propose Group Expectation Policy Optimization
(GEPO), which reduces importance weight variance through a refined sampling
mechanism. Theoretically, GEPO achieves exponential variance reduction.
Experiments show it maintains superior stability over methods like GRPO, with
less than 3% performance degradation under 1800-second delays, demonstrating
strong potential for decentralized RL in heterogeneous networks.

Abstract: Accurate air quality prediction is becoming increasingly important in the
environmental field. To address issues such as low prediction accuracy and slow
real-time updates in existing models, which lead to lagging prediction results,
we propose a Transformer-based spatiotemporal data prediction method
(Ada-TransGNN) that integrates global spatial semantics and temporal behavior.
The model constructs an efficient and collaborative spatiotemporal block set
comprising a multi-head attention mechanism and a graph convolutional network
to extract dynamically changing spatiotemporal dependency features from complex
air quality monitoring data. Considering the interaction relationships between
different monitoring points, we propose an adaptive graph structure learning
module, which combines spatiotemporal dependency features in a data-driven
manner to learn the optimal graph structure, thereby more accurately capturing
the spatial relationships between monitoring points. Additionally, we design an
auxiliary task learning module that enhances the decoding capability of
temporal relationships by integrating spatial context information into the
optimal graph structure representation, effectively improving the accuracy of
prediction results. We conducted comprehensive evaluations on a benchmark
dataset and a novel dataset (Mete-air). The results demonstrate that our model
outperforms existing state-of-the-art prediction models in short-term and
long-term predictions.

employs an adaptive fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) module to transform
spectrum data into a suitable fractional Fourier domain, enhancing the
separability of predictable trends from noise. Subsequently, an adaptive Filter
module selectively suppresses noise while preserving critical predictive
features within this domain. Finally, a prediction module, leveraging a
complex-valued neural network, learns and forecasts these filtered trend
components. Experiments on real-world spectrum data show that the SFFP
outperforms leading spectrum and general forecasting methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型微调面临参数效率挑战，现有PEFT方法如LoRA存在优化器效率问题，特别是B矩阵的基冗余限制了性能

Result: Stiefel优化器在LoRA和DoRA的各种基准测试中一致优于AdamW，显著提升参数效率和表示容量

Conclusion: 几何约束是释放LoRA在LLM微调中全部潜力的关键，Stiefel流形优化提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: While powerful, large language models (LLMs) present significant fine-tuning
challenges due to their size. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods
like LoRA provide solutions, yet suffer from critical optimizer inefficiencies;
notably basis redundancy in LoRA's $B$ matrix when using AdamW, which
fundamentally limits performance. We address this by optimizing the $B$ matrix
on the Stiefel manifold, imposing explicit orthogonality constraints that
achieve near-perfect orthogonality and full effective rank. This geometric
approach dramatically enhances parameter efficiency and representational
capacity. Our Stiefel optimizer consistently outperforms AdamW across
benchmarks with both LoRA and DoRA, demonstrating that geometric constraints
are the key to unlocking LoRA's full potential for effective LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recently, detection of label errors and improvement of label quality in
datasets for supervised learning tasks has become an increasingly important
goal in both research and industry. The consequences of incorrectly annotated
data include reduced model performance, biased benchmark results, and lower
overall accuracy. Current state-of-the-art label error detection methods often
focus on a single computer vision task and, consequently, a specific type of
dataset, containing, for example, either bounding boxes or pixel-wise
annotations. Furthermore, previous methods are not learning-based. In this
work, we overcome this research gap. We present a unified method for detecting
label errors in object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance
segmentation datasets. In a nutshell, our approach - learning to detect label
errors by making them - works as follows: we inject different kinds of label
errors into the ground truth. Then, the detection of label errors, across all
mentioned primary tasks, is framed as an instance segmentation problem based on
a composite input. In our experiments, we compare the label error detection
performance of our method with various baselines and state-of-the-art
approaches of each task's domain on simulated label errors across multiple
tasks, datasets, and base models. This is complemented by a generalization
study on real-world label errors. Additionally, we release 459 real label
errors identified in the Cityscapes dataset and provide a benchmark for real
label error detection in Cityscapes.

TL;DR: FedMate是一个联邦学习方法，通过双边优化解决跨客户端数据异构性问题，在服务器端构建动态全局原型，在客户端引入互补分类融合，在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中的跨客户端数据异构性导致偏见，阻碍无偏共识凝聚和泛化-个性化知识的互补融合。现有方法通过模型解耦和表示中心损失来缓解异构性，但依赖静态受限指标评估本地知识，全局对齐过于刚性，导致共识扭曲和模型适应性下降。

Result: 在五个不同复杂度数据集上的实验表明，FedMate在协调泛化和适应性方面优于最先进方法。在自动驾驶数据集上的语义分割实验验证了该方法在现实世界中的可扩展性。

Conclusion: FedMate通过双边优化有效解决了联邦学习中的数据异构性问题，在保持全局一致性的同时提升了模型的泛化能力和个性化适应性，具有很好的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Cross-client data heterogeneity in federated learning induces biases that
impede unbiased consensus condensation and the complementary fusion of
generalization- and personalization-oriented knowledge. While existing
approaches mitigate heterogeneity through model decoupling and representation
center loss, they often rely on static and restricted metrics to evaluate local
knowledge and adopt global alignment too rigidly, leading to consensus
distortion and diminished model adaptability. To address these limitations, we
propose FedMate, a method that implements bilateral optimization: On the server
side, we construct a dynamic global prototype, with aggregation weights
calibrated by holistic integration of sample size, current parameters, and
future prediction; a category-wise classifier is then fine-tuned using this
prototype to preserve global consistency. On the client side, we introduce
complementary classification fusion to enable merit-based discrimination
training and incorporate cost-aware feature transmission to balance model
performance and communication efficiency. Experiments on five datasets of
varying complexity demonstrate that FedMate outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in harmonizing generalization and adaptation. Additionally, semantic
segmentation experiments on autonomous driving datasets validate the method's
real-world scalability.

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
achieving unprecedented communication efficiency in sixth-generation (6G)
networks by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to extract and transmit the
underlying meanings of source data. However, deploying SemCom over digital
systems presents new challenges, particularly in ensuring robustness against
transmission errors that may distort semantically critical content. To address
this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework, termed generative feature
imputing, which comprises three key techniques. First, we introduce a spatial
error concentration packetization strategy that spatially concentrates feature
distortions by encoding feature elements based on their channel mappings, a
property crucial for both the effectiveness and reduced complexity of the
subsequent techniques. Second, building on this strategy, we propose a
generative feature imputing method that utilizes a diffusion model to
efficiently reconstruct missing features caused by packet losses. Finally, we
develop a semantic-aware power allocation scheme that enables unequal error
protection by allocating transmission power according to the semantic
importance of each packet. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
framework outperforms conventional approaches, such as Deep Joint
Source-Channel Coding (DJSCC) and JPEG2000, under block fading conditions,
achieving higher semantic accuracy and lower Learned Perceptual Image Patch
Similarity (LPIPS) scores.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合神经网络和拓扑信息，实现了高质量的时间变化标量场插值，在几何和拓扑保真度方面表现出色

Abstract: This paper presents a neural scheme for the topology-aware interpolation of
time-varying scalar fields. Given a time-varying sequence of persistence
diagrams, along with a sparse temporal sampling of the corresponding scalar
fields, denoted as keyframes, our interpolation approach aims at "inverting"
the non-keyframe diagrams to produce plausible estimations of the
corresponding, missing data. For this, we rely on a neural architecture which
learns the relation from a time value to the corresponding scalar field, based
on the keyframe examples, and reliably extends this relation to the
non-keyframe time steps. We show how augmenting this architecture with specific
topological losses exploiting the input diagrams both improves the geometrical
and topological reconstruction of the non-keyframe time steps. At query time,
given an input time value for which an interpolation is desired, our approach
instantaneously produces an output, via a single propagation of the time input
through the network. Experiments interpolating 2D and 3D time-varying datasets
show our approach superiority, both in terms of data and topological fitting,
with regard to reference interpolation schemes.

Abstract: In this PhD thesis, we propose a novel framework for uncertainty
quantification in machine learning, which is based on proper scores.
Uncertainty quantification is an important cornerstone for trustworthy and
reliable machine learning applications in practice. Usually, approaches to
uncertainty quantification are problem-specific, and solutions and insights
cannot be readily transferred from one task to another. Proper scores are loss
functions minimized by predicting the target distribution. Due to their very
general definition, proper scores apply to regression, classification, or even
generative modeling tasks. We contribute several theoretical results, that
connect epistemic uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty, and model calibration
with proper scores, resulting in a general and widely applicable framework. We
achieve this by introducing a general bias-variance decomposition for strictly
proper scores via functional Bregman divergences. Specifically, we use the
kernel score, a kernel-based proper score, for evaluating sample-based
generative models in various domains, like image, audio, and natural language
generation. This includes a novel approach for uncertainty estimation of large
language models, which outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Further, we
generalize the calibration-sharpness decomposition beyond classification, which
motivates the definition of proper calibration errors. We then introduce a
novel estimator for proper calibration errors in classification, and a novel
risk-based approach to compare different estimators for squared calibration
errors. Last, we offer a decomposition of the kernel spherical score, another
kernel-based proper score, allowing a more fine-grained and interpretable
evaluation of generative image models.

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计更鲁棒的深度神经网络提供了重要见解，明确了对抗训练方法中最有效的组件。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown substantial success in various
applications but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This study aims to
identify and isolate the components of two different adversarial training
techniques that contribute most to increased adversarial robustness,
particularly through the lens of margins in the input space -- the minimal
distance between data points and decision boundaries. Specifically, we compare
two methods that maximize margins: a simple approach which modifies the loss
function to increase an approximation of the margin, and a more complex
state-of-the-art method (Dynamics-Aware Robust Training) which builds upon this
approach. Using a VGG-16 model as our base, we systematically isolate and
evaluate individual components from these methods to determine their relative
impact on adversarial robustness. We assess the effect of each component on the
model's performance under various adversarial attacks, including AutoAttack and
Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). Our analysis on the CIFAR-10 dataset reveals
which elements most effectively enhance adversarial robustness, providing
insights for designing more robust DNNs.

Abstract: Autonomous planetary exploration missions are critically dependent on
real-time, accurate environmental perception for navigation and hazard
avoidance. However, deploying deep learning models on the resource-constrained
computational hardware of planetary exploration platforms remains a significant
challenge. This paper introduces the Adaptive Quantized Planetary Crater
Detection System (AQ-PCDSys), a novel framework specifically engineered for
real-time, onboard deployment in the computationally constrained environments
of space exploration missions. AQ-PCDSys synergistically integrates a Quantized
Neural Network (QNN) architecture, trained using Quantization-Aware Training
(QAT), with an Adaptive Multi-Sensor Fusion (AMF) module. The QNN architecture
significantly optimizes model size and inference latency suitable for real-time
onboard deployment in space exploration missions, while preserving high
accuracy. The AMF module intelligently fuses data from Optical Imagery (OI) and
Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) at the feature level, utilizing an Adaptive
Weighting Mechanism (AWM) to dynamically prioritize the most relevant and
reliable sensor modality based on planetary ambient conditions. This approach
enhances detection robustness across diverse planetary landscapes. Paired with
Multi-Scale Detection Heads specifically designed for robust and efficient
detection of craters across a wide range of sizes, AQ-PCDSys provides a
computationally efficient, reliable and accurate solution for planetary crater
detection, a critical capability for enabling the next generation of autonomous
planetary landing, navigation, and scientific exploration.

Conclusion: 通过利用公共数据信息，提出的变换方法显著提升了差分隐私线性回归的估计精度和鲁棒性

Abstract: Leveraging information from public data has become increasingly crucial in
enhancing the utility of differentially private (DP) methods. Traditional DP
approaches often require adding noise based solely on private data, which can
significantly degrade utility. In this paper, we address this limitation in the
context of the ordinary least squares estimator (OLSE) of linear regression
based on sufficient statistics perturbation (SSP) under the unbounded data
assumption. We propose a novel method that involves transforming private data
using the public second-moment matrix to compute a transformed SSP-OLSE, whose
second-moment matrix yields a better condition number and improves the OLSE
accuracy and robustness. We derive theoretical error bounds about our method
and the standard SSP-OLSE to the non-DP OLSE, which reveal the improved
robustness and accuracy achieved by our approach. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Non-parametric change-point detection in streaming time series data is a
long-standing challenge in signal processing. Recent advancements in statistics
and machine learning have increasingly addressed this problem for data residing
on Riemannian manifolds. One prominent strategy involves monitoring abrupt
changes in the center of mass of the time series. Implemented in a streaming
fashion, this strategy, however, requires careful step size tuning when
computing the updates of the center of mass. In this paper, we propose to
leverage robust centroid on manifolds from M-estimation theory to address this
issue. Our proposal consists of comparing two centroid estimates: the classical
Karcher mean (sensitive to change) versus one defined from Huber's function
(robust to change). This comparison leads to the definition of a test statistic
whose performance is less sensitive to the underlying estimation method. We
propose a stochastic Riemannian optimization algorithm to estimate both robust
centroids efficiently. Experiments conducted on both simulated and real-world
data across two representative manifolds demonstrate the superior performance
of our proposed method.

Abstract: Simulating physics using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is predominantly driven
by message-passing architectures, which face challenges in scaling and
efficiency, particularly in handling large, complex meshes. These architectures
have inspired numerous enhancements, including multigrid approaches and $K$-hop
aggregation (using neighbours of distance $K$), yet they often introduce
significant complexity and suffer from limited in-depth investigations. In
response to these challenges, we propose a novel Graph Transformer architecture
that leverages the adjacency matrix as an attention mask. The proposed approach
incorporates innovative augmentations, including Dilated Sliding Windows and
Global Attention, to extend receptive fields without sacrificing computational
efficiency. Through extensive experimentation, we evaluate model size,
adjacency matrix augmentations, positional encoding and $K$-hop configurations
using challenging 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) datasets. We also train
over 60 models to find a scaling law between training FLOPs and parameters. The
introduced models demonstrate remarkable scalability, performing on meshes with
up to 300k nodes and 3 million edges. Notably, the smallest model achieves
parity with MeshGraphNet while being $7\times$ faster and $6\times$ smaller.
The largest model surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by $38.8$\% on
average and outperforms MeshGraphNet by $52$\% on the all-rollout RMSE, while
having a similar training speed. Code and datasets are available at

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are known to match the distinguishing power of
the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test, and the resulting partitions coincide with
the unfolding tree equivalence classes of graphs. Preserving this equivalence,
GNNs can universally approximate any target function on graphs in probability
up to any precision. However, these results are limited to attributed
discrete-dynamic graphs represented as sequences of connected graph snapshots.
Real-world systems, such as communication networks, financial transaction
networks, and molecular interactions, evolve asynchronously and may split into
disconnected components. In this paper, we extend the theory of attributed
discrete-dynamic graphs to attributed continuous-time dynamic graphs with
arbitrary connectivity. To this end, we introduce a continuous-time dynamic
1-WL test, prove its equivalence to continuous-time dynamic unfolding trees,
and identify a class of continuous-time dynamic GNNs (CGNNs) based on
discrete-dynamic GNN architectures that retain both distinguishing power and
universal approximation guarantees. Our constructive proofs further yield
practical design guidelines, emphasizing a compact and expressive CGNN
architecture with piece-wise continuously differentiable temporal functions to
process asynchronous, disconnected graphs.

Conclusion: FedGreed提供了一种无需假设恶意客户端比例的有效防御机制，在异构数据分布和强对抗行为下具有收敛保证和有界最优性差距

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy by keeping local datasets on-device. In
this work, we address FL settings where clients may behave adversarially,
exhibiting Byzantine attacks, while the central server is trusted and equipped
with a reference dataset. We propose FedGreed, a resilient aggregation strategy
for federated learning that does not require any assumptions about the fraction
of adversarial participants. FedGreed orders clients' local model updates based
on their loss metrics evaluated against a trusted dataset on the server and
greedily selects a subset of clients whose models exhibit the minimal
evaluation loss. Unlike many existing approaches, our method is designed to
operate reliably under heterogeneous (non-IID) data distributions, which are
prevalent in real-world deployments. FedGreed exhibits convergence guarantees
and bounded optimality gaps under strong adversarial behavior. Experimental
evaluations on MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms standard and robust federated learning baselines,
such as Mean, Trimmed Mean, Median, Krum, and Multi-Krum, in the majority of
adversarial scenarios considered, including label flipping and Gaussian noise
injection attacks. All experiments were conducted using the Flower federated

to spoofing attacks, where adversaries transmit counterfeit signals to mislead
receivers. Such attacks can lead to severe consequences, including misdirected
navigation, compromised data integrity, and operational disruptions. Most
existing spoofing detection methods depend on supervised learning techniques
and struggle to detect novel, evolved, and unseen attacks. To overcome this
limitation, we develop a zero-day spoofing detection method using a Hybrid
Quantum-Classical Autoencoder (HQC-AE), trained solely on authentic GNSS
signals without exposure to spoofed data. By leveraging features extracted
during the tracking stage, our method enables proactive detection before PNT
solutions are computed. We focus on spoofing detection in static GNSS
receivers, which are particularly susceptible to time-push spoofing attacks,
where attackers manipulate timing information to induce incorrect time
computations at the receiver. We evaluate our model against different unseen
time-push spoofing attack scenarios: simplistic, intermediate, and
sophisticated. Our analysis demonstrates that the HQC-AE consistently
outperforms its classical counterpart, traditional supervised learning-based
models, and existing unsupervised learning-based methods in detecting zero-day,
unseen GNSS time-push spoofing attacks, achieving an average detection accuracy
of 97.71% with an average false negative rate of 0.62% (when an attack occurs
but is not detected). For sophisticated spoofing attacks, the HQC-AE attains an
accuracy of 98.23% with a false negative rate of 1.85%. These findings
highlight the effectiveness of our method in proactively detecting zero-day
GNSS time-push spoofing attacks across various stationary GNSS receiver
platforms.

TL;DR: 提出基于条件流匹配和EM算法的混合噪声贝叶斯反问题推断框架，能够联合估计后验采样器和噪声参数，在高维场景下具有良好可扩展性。


<details>

Motivation: 现实应用（特别是物理和化学领域）中的噪声通常具有未知和异质性结构，而传统方法往往假设固定或已知的噪声特性，无法有效处理混合噪声问题。

Method: 将条件流匹配嵌入到期望最大化（EM）算法中，在E步使用无模拟的基于ODE的流匹配作为生成模型，联合估计后验采样器和噪声参数。

Result: 在适当假设下，证明了EM更新在无限观测总体极限下收敛到真实噪声参数。数值结果表明该方法对混合噪声贝叶斯反问题有效。

Conclusion: 结合EM推断和流匹配的方法为处理具有混合噪声结构的高维贝叶斯反问题提供了有效的解决方案，具有良好的理论和实证性能。

Abstract: We study Bayesian inverse problems with mixed noise, modeled as a combination
of additive and multiplicative Gaussian components. While traditional inference
methods often assume fixed or known noise characteristics, real-world
applications, particularly in physics and chemistry, frequently involve noise
with unknown and heterogeneous structure. Motivated by recent advances in
flow-based generative modeling, we propose a novel inference framework based on
conditional flow matching embedded within an Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm to jointly estimate posterior samplers and noise parameters. To
enable high-dimensional inference and improve scalability, we use
simulation-free ODE-based flow matching as the generative model in the E-step
of the EM algorithm. We prove that, under suitable assumptions, the EM updates
converge to the true noise parameters in the population limit of infinite
observations. Our numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of combining
EM inference with flow matching for mixed-noise Bayesian inverse problems.

Abstract: We introduce CMPhysBench, designed to assess the proficiency of Large
Language Models (LLMs) in Condensed Matter Physics, as a novel Benchmark.
CMPhysBench is composed of more than 520 graduate-level meticulously curated
questions covering both representative subfields and foundational theoretical
frameworks of condensed matter physics, such as magnetism, superconductivity,
strongly correlated systems, etc. To ensure a deep understanding of the
problem-solving process,we focus exclusively on calculation problems, requiring
LLMs to independently generate comprehensive solutions. Meanwhile, leveraging
tree-based representations of expressions, we introduce the Scalable Expression
Edit Distance (SEED) score, which provides fine-grained (non-binary) partial
credit and yields a more accurate assessment of similarity between prediction
and ground-truth. Our results show that even the best models, Grok-4, reach
only 36 average SEED score and 28% accuracy on CMPhysBench, underscoring a
significant capability gap, especially for this practical and frontier domain
relative to traditional physics. The code anddataset are publicly available at

TL;DR: FreezeTST是一种轻量级混合模型，将冻结的随机特征（储层）块与标准可训练Transformer层交错组合，在保持推理复杂度的同时显著降低训练成本和参数数量，在长期时间序列预测任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer在长序列建模中存在二次自注意力计算成本高和时间偏差弱的问题，导致长程预测既昂贵又脆弱，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用混合架构设计：冻结的随机特征块提供丰富的非线性记忆而无需优化成本，可训练的Transformer层通过自注意力学习查询这些记忆，大幅减少可训练参数和训练时间。

Result: 在七个标准长期预测基准测试中，FreezeTST始终匹配或超越Informer、Autoformer和PatchTST等专门变体，且计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 将储层原理嵌入Transformer中为高效长期时间序列预测提供了一条简单而原则性的途径，证明了混合架构在序列建模中的有效性。

Abstract: Transformers are the de-facto choice for sequence modelling, yet their
quadratic self-attention and weak temporal bias can make long-range forecasting
both expensive and brittle. We introduce FreezeTST, a lightweight hybrid that
interleaves frozen random-feature (reservoir) blocks with standard trainable
Transformer layers. The frozen blocks endow the network with rich nonlinear
memory at no optimisation cost; the trainable layers learn to query this memory
through self-attention. The design cuts trainable parameters and also lowers
wall-clock training time, while leaving inference complexity unchanged. On
seven standard long-term forecasting benchmarks, FreezeTST consistently matches
or surpasses specialised variants such as Informer, Autoformer, and PatchTST;
with substantially lower compute. Our results show that embedding reservoir
principles within Transformers offers a simple, principled route to efficient
long-term time-series prediction.

Conclusion: 研究为研究人员提供了实用指南，阐明了模型表达能力与可解释性之间的权衡，确立了基于神经网络的架构在复杂系统科学发现中的可行性。

Abstract: The ``black-box'' nature of deep learning models presents a significant
barrier to their adoption for scientific discovery, where interpretability is
paramount. This challenge is especially pronounced in discovering the governing
equations of dynamical processes on networks or graphs, since even their
topological structure further affects the processes' behavior. This paper
provides a rigorous, comparative assessment of state-of-the-art symbolic
regression techniques for this task. We evaluate established methods, including
sparse regression and MLP-based architectures, and introduce a novel adaptation
of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for graphs, designed to exploit their
inherent interpretability. Across a suite of synthetic and real-world dynamical
systems, our results demonstrate that both MLP and KAN-based architectures can
successfully identify the underlying symbolic equations, significantly
surpassing existing baselines. Critically, we show that KANs achieve this
performance with greater parsimony and transparency, as their learnable
activation functions provide a clearer mapping to the true physical dynamics.
This study offers a practical guide for researchers, clarifying the trade-offs
between model expressivity and interpretability, and establishes the viability
of neural-based architectures for robust scientific discovery on complex
systems.

Motivation: 传统分子动力学和马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛方法缺乏摊销性，每个系统的采样计算成本都很高。现有学习方法在单一系统上表现良好，但跨系统转移能力有限。

Method: 开发了Prose——一个基于深度学习的可转移标准化流模型，使用包含最多8个残基的肽分子动力学轨迹数据集进行训练，能够进行零样本采样。

Result: Prose作为各种采样算法的提议分布表现优异，通过简单的基于重要性采样的微调程序，在未见过的四肽上表现优于传统的序列蒙特卡洛方法。

Conclusion: 深度学习能够设计出可扩展和可转移的采样器，Prose证明了标准化流在分子构象采样中的潜力，为摊销采样方法的研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Efficient equilibrium sampling of molecular conformations remains a core
challenge in computational chemistry and statistical inference. Classical
approaches such as molecular dynamics or Markov chain Monte Carlo inherently
lack amortization; the computational cost of sampling must be paid in-full for
each system of interest. The widespread success of generative models has
inspired interest into overcoming this limitation through learning sampling
algorithms. Despite performing on par with conventional methods when trained on
a single system, learned samplers have so far demonstrated limited ability to
transfer across systems. We prove that deep learning enables the design of
scalable and transferable samplers by introducing Prose, a 280 million
parameter all-atom transferable normalizing flow trained on a corpus of peptide
molecular dynamics trajectories up to 8 residues in length. Prose draws
zero-shot uncorrelated proposal samples for arbitrary peptide systems,
achieving the previously intractable transferability across sequence length,
whilst retaining the efficient likelihood evaluation of normalizing flows.
Through extensive empirical evaluation we demonstrate the efficacy of Prose as
a proposal for a variety of sampling algorithms, finding a simple importance
sampling-based finetuning procedure to achieve superior performance to
established methods such as sequential Monte Carlo on unseen tetrapeptides. We
open-source the Prose codebase, model weights, and training dataset, to further
stimulate research into amortized sampling methods and finetuning objectives.

TL;DR: 通过多实例训练、适应性批处理DiLoCo和切换模式机制，提高异构硬件集群的训练效率和收敛速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如DiLoCo在动态负载下无法充分利用异构计算集群的计算资源

Method: 三阶段方法：1)多实例训练(MIT)并行运行多个轻量训练流；2)适应性批处理DiLoCo动态调整本地批量大小；3)切换模式机制在批量过大时引入梯度累积

Result: 提高了系统吞吐量、减少空闲时间、降低同步延迟，改善了收敛速度和系统效率

Conclusion: 该方法能够在异构硬件环境下更有效地进行大语言模型的分布式训练，并提供了相关的理论收敛分析

Abstract: Scaling distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires not
only algorithmic advances but also efficient utilization of heterogeneous
hardware resources. While existing methods such as DiLoCo have demonstrated
promising results, they often fail to fully exploit computational clusters
under dynamic workloads. To address this limitation, we propose a three-stage
method that combines Multi-Instance Training (MIT), Adaptive Batched DiLoCo,
and switch mode mechanism. MIT allows individual nodes to run multiple
lightweight training streams with different model instances in parallel and
merge them to combine knowledge, increasing throughput and reducing idle time.
Adaptive Batched DiLoCo dynamically adjusts local batch sizes to balance
computation and communication, substantially lowering synchronization delays.
Switch mode further stabilizes training by seamlessly introducing gradient
accumulation once adaptive batch sizes grow beyond hardware-friendly limits.
Together, these innovations improve both convergence speed and system
efficiency. We also provide a theoretical estimate of the number of
communications required for the full convergence of a model trained using our
method.

TL;DR: 提出了基于双曲几何的HypER回声状态网络，通过双曲距离的指数衰减连接来匹配混沌系统的拉伸-折叠结构，显著延长了混沌系统的有效预测时间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ESN的欧几里得几何与混沌系统的拉伸-折叠结构不匹配，限制了混沌动力学的长期预测能力

Method: 在庞加莱球中采样神经元，连接权重随双曲距离指数衰减，保持稀疏性、泄漏积分和谱半径控制等标准ESN特性，仅训练Tikhonov正则化读出层

Result: 在Lorenz-63、Roessler系统和Chen-Ueta超混沌吸引子上，HypER显著延长了平均有效预测时间，在30次独立运行中均获得统计显著增益；在心率变异性、太阳黑子数等真实数据上也表现出优势

Conclusion: 双曲几何嵌入直接匹配了混沌系统的局部扩张-收缩谱，提供了与Lyapunov增长类似的状态发散下界，为混沌系统长期预测提供了有效方法

Abstract: Forecasting chaotic dynamics beyond a few Lyapunov times is difficult because
infinitesimal errors grow exponentially. Existing Echo State Networks (ESNs)
mitigate this growth but employ reservoirs whose Euclidean geometry is
mismatched to the stretch-and-fold structure of chaos. We introduce the
Hyperbolic Embedding Reservoir (HypER), an ESN whose neurons are sampled in the
Poincare ball and whose connections decay exponentially with hyperbolic
distance. This negative-curvature construction embeds an exponential metric
directly into the latent space, aligning the reservoir's local
expansion-contraction spectrum with the system's Lyapunov directions while
preserving standard ESN features such as sparsity, leaky integration, and
spectral-radius control. Training is limited to a Tikhonov-regularized readout.
On the chaotic Lorenz-63 and Roessler systems, and the hyperchaotic Chen-Ueta
attractor, HypER consistently lengthens the mean valid-prediction horizon
beyond Euclidean and graph-structured ESN baselines, with statistically
significant gains confirmed over 30 independent runs; parallel results on
real-world benchmarks, including heart-rate variability from the Santa Fe and
MIT-BIH datasets and international sunspot numbers, corroborate its advantage.
We further establish a lower bound on the rate of state divergence for HypER,
mirroring Lyapunov growth.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于深度学习和矩阵补全的方法，用于恢复物联网网络定位中受异常值污染的欧几里得距离矩阵，通过联合恢复距离矩阵和传感器坐标，并建模异常值为稀疏矩阵进行有效处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统定位技术在矩阵全集上搜索解，而本方法将搜索限制在欧几里得距离矩阵集合上，旨在更有效地处理异常值污染的距离矩阵恢复问题。

Method: 将距离矩阵D表示为传感器坐标矩阵X的函数，利用深度神经网络联合恢复D和X；将异常值建模为稀疏矩阵L并加入正则化项；通过交替更新X、D和L来求解优化问题。

Result: 数值实验表明，即使在存在异常值的情况下，该技术也能准确恢复传感器的位置信息。

Conclusion: 所提出的深度学习和矩阵补全方法能够有效处理异常值污染，在物联网网络定位中实现准确的距离矩阵和位置信息恢复。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a deep learning and matrix completion aided
approach for recovering an outlier contaminated Euclidean distance matrix D in
IoT network localization. Unlike conventional localization techniques that
search the solution over a whole set of matrices, the proposed technique
restricts the search to the set of Euclidean distance matrices. Specifically,
we express D as a function of the sensor coordinate matrix X that inherently
satisfies the unique properties of D, and then jointly recover D and X using a
deep neural network. To handle outliers effectively, we model them as a sparse
matrix L and add a regularization term of L into the optimization problem. We
then solve the problem by alternately updating X, D, and L. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that the proposed technique can recover the location
information of sensors accurately even in the presence of outliers.

Conclusion: TACs为开发可靠、任务合规的LLM系统提供了一个稳健且理论基础的范式

Abstract: Reliably composing Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex, multi-step
workflows remains a significant challenge. The dominant paradigm-optimizing
discrete prompts in a pipeline-is notoriously brittle and struggles to enforce
the formal compliance required for structured tasks. We introduce
Type-Compliant Adaptation Cascades (TACs), a framework that recasts workflow
adaptation as learning typed probabilistic programs. TACs treats the entire
workflow, which is composed of parameter-efficiently adapted LLMs and
deterministic logic, as an unnormalized joint distribution. This enables
principled, gradient-based training even with latent intermediate structures.
We provide theoretical justification for our tractable optimization objective,
proving that the optimization bias vanishes as the model learns type
compliance. Empirically, TACs significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
prompt-optimization baselines. Gains are particularly pronounced on structured
tasks, improving MGSM-SymPy from $57.1\%$ to $75.9\%$ for a 27B model, MGSM
from $1.6\%$ to $27.3\%$ for a 7B model. TACs offers a robust and theoretically
grounded paradigm for developing reliable, task-compliant LLM systems.

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现快速可扩展的评估循环，适用于权重复杂或先验未知的任务，有效解决了评估对齐问题。

Abstract: Every prediction is ultimately used in a downstream task. Consequently,
evaluating prediction quality is more meaningful when considered in the context
of its downstream use. Metrics based solely on predictive performance often
diverge from measures of real-world downstream impact. Existing approaches
incorporate the downstream view by relying on multiple task-specific metrics,
which can be burdensome to analyze, or by formulating cost-sensitive
evaluations that require an explicit cost structure, typically assumed to be
known a priori. We frame this mismatch as an evaluation alignment problem and
propose a data-driven method to learn a proxy evaluation function aligned with
the downstream evaluation. Building on the theory of proper scoring rules, we
explore transformations of scoring rules that ensure the preservation of
propriety. Our approach leverages weighted scoring rules parametrized by a
neural network, where weighting is learned to align with the performance in the
downstream task. This enables fast and scalable evaluation cycles across tasks
where the weighting is complex or unknown a priori. We showcase our framework
through synthetic and real-data experiments for regression tasks, demonstrating
its potential to bridge the gap between predictive evaluation and downstream
utility in modular prediction systems.

Motivation: 现有优化器如Adam和Adan在非平稳或噪声环境中性能下降，主要原因是依赖基于动量的幅度估计。需要一种更鲁棒的优化方法。

Method: 提出Ano优化器，解耦方向和平滑：动量用于方向平滑，瞬时梯度幅度决定步长。进一步提出Anolog，通过对数调度扩展动量窗口。

Result: 建立了非凸收敛保证，收敛速率与其他基于符号的方法相似。在强化学习等噪声和非平稳环境中表现显著提升，在计算机视觉基准测试中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: Ano优化器在保持一阶方法简洁高效的同时，提高了对梯度噪声的鲁棒性，特别适用于噪声和非平稳环境。

Abstract: Stochastic optimizers are central to deep learning, yet widely used methods
such as Adam and Adan can degrade in non-stationary or noisy environments,
partly due to their reliance on momentum-based magnitude estimates. We
introduce Ano, a novel optimizer that decouples direction and magnitude:
momentum is used for directional smoothing, while instantaneous gradient
magnitudes determine step size. This design improves robustness to gradient
noise while retaining the simplicity and efficiency of first-order methods. We
further propose Anolog, which removes sensitivity to the momentum coefficient
by expanding its window over time via a logarithmic schedule. We establish
non-convex convergence guarantees with a convergence rate similar to other
sign-based methods, and empirically show that Ano provides substantial gains in
noisy and non-stationary regimes such as reinforcement learning, while
remaining competitive on low-noise tasks such as standard computer vision
benchmarks.

TL;DR: Boltzina是一个新型计算框架，在保持Boltz-2高精度结合亲和力预测的同时，通过省略结构预测步骤和利用AutoDock Vina对接构象，显著提高了计算效率，实现了精度与速度的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分子对接方法预测精度有限，而高精度的Boltz-2方法计算成本过高（每化合物20秒/GPU），难以应用于大规模化合物筛选。需要开发既能保持高精度又具有实用计算效率的方法。

Method: 提出Boltzina框架，省略Boltz-2中的限速结构预测步骤，直接从AutoDock Vina对接构象预测亲和力。采用减少循环迭代和批处理技术，并研究多构象选择策略和Boltzina与Boltz-2的两阶段筛选组合。

Conclusion: 该研究首次将Boltz-2的高精度预测应用于实际规模筛选，提供了在计算生物学中兼顾精度和效率的解决方案，为不同应用需求提供了优化的准确性和效率方法。

Abstract: In structure-based drug discovery, virtual screening using conventional
molecular docking methods can be performed rapidly but suffers from limitations
in prediction accuracy. Recently, Boltz-2 was proposed, achieving extremely
high accuracy in binding affinity prediction, but requiring approximately 20
seconds per compound per GPU, making it difficult to apply to large-scale
screening of hundreds of thousands to millions of compounds. This study
proposes Boltzina, a novel framework that leverages Boltz-2's high accuracy
while significantly improving computational efficiency. Boltzina achieves both
accuracy and speed by omitting the rate-limiting structure prediction from
Boltz-2's architecture and directly predicting affinity from AutoDock Vina
docking poses. We evaluate on eight assays from the MF-PCBA dataset and show
that while Boltzina performs below Boltz-2, it provides significantly higher
screening performance compared to AutoDock Vina and GNINA. Additionally,
Boltzina achieved up to 11.8$\times$ faster through reduced recycling
iterations and batch processing. Furthermore, we investigated multi-pose
selection strategies and two-stage screening combining Boltzina and Boltz-2,
presenting optimization methods for accuracy and efficiency according to
application requirements. This study represents the first attempt to apply
Boltz-2's high-accuracy predictions to practical-scale screening, offering a
pipeline that combines both accuracy and efficiency in computational biology.

Abstract: Recent advances in geometric deep learning and generative modeling have
enabled the design of novel proteins with a wide range of desired properties.
However, current state-of-the-art approaches are typically restricted to
generating proteins with only static target properties, such as motifs and
symmetries. In this work, we take a step towards overcoming this limitation by
proposing a framework to condition structure generation on flexibility, which
is crucial for key functionalities such as catalysis or molecular recognition.
We first introduce BackFlip, an equivariant neural network for predicting
per-residue flexibility from an input backbone structure. Relying on BackFlip,
we propose FliPS, an SE(3)-equivariant conditional flow matching model that
solves the inverse problem, that is, generating backbones that display a target
flexibility profile. In our experiments, we show that FliPS is able to generate
novel and diverse protein backbones with the desired flexibility, verified by
Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. FliPS and BackFlip are available at

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: EEG-FM-Bench是首个用于系统评估EEG基础模型的综合基准测试，提供标准化评估框架、基准结果和表征分析，以促进EEG基础模型的公平比较和可重复研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG基础模型的快速发展缺乏标准化评估基准，导致模型比较困难，阻碍了系统性科学进展，需要统一的评估平台来解决这一关键差距。

Method: 通过策划多样化的下游任务和数据集，实施标准化处理和评估协议，建立统一的开源框架，并对现有先进基础模型进行基准测试和表征分析。

Result: 研究发现细粒度时空特征交互、多任务统一训练和神经心理学先验知识有助于提升模型性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: EEG-FM-Bench为公平比较和可重复研究提供了统一平台，旨在推动社区开发更鲁棒和可泛化的EEG基础模型。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models are poised to significantly
advance brain signal analysis by learning robust representations from
large-scale, unlabeled datasets. However, their rapid proliferation has
outpaced the development of standardized evaluation benchmarks, which
complicates direct model comparisons and hinders systematic scientific
progress. This fragmentation fosters scientific inefficiency and obscures
genuine architectural advancements. To address this critical gap, we introduce
EEG-FM-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for the systematic and
standardized evaluation of EEG foundation models (EEG-FMs). Our contributions
are threefold: (1) we curate a diverse suite of downstream tasks and datasets
from canonical EEG paradigms, implementing standardized processing and
evaluation protocols within a unified open-source framework; (2) we benchmark
prominent state-of-the-art foundation models to establish comprehensive
baseline results for a clear comparison of the current landscape; (3) we
perform qualitative analyses of the learned representations to provide insights
into model behavior and inform future architectural design. Through extensive
experiments, we find that fine-grained spatio-temporal feature interaction,
multitask unified training and neuropsychological priors would contribute to
enhancing model performance and generalization capabilities. By offering a
unified platform for fair comparison and reproducible research, EEG-FM-Bench
seeks to catalyze progress and guide the community toward the development of
more robust and generalizable EEG-FMs. Code is released at
https://github.com/xw1216/EEG-FM-Bench.

TL;DR: 提出Equinox系统，通过双计数器框架和预测专家混合模型实现公平感知调度，在保持高GPU利用率的同时提升吞吐量和降低延迟


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前LLM服务中用户服务质量与资源效率之间的调度矛盾，需要平衡用户公平性和资源公平性

Method: 使用用户公平计数器（加权token和延迟）和资源公平计数器（吞吐量和GPU利用率），结合Mixture of Prediction Experts预测框架来预计算统一的全栈公平分数

Result: 相比VTC系统，吞吐量提升1.3倍，首token延迟降低60%，公平性提升13%，GPU利用率保持94%

Conclusion: Equinox系统通过前瞻性公平感知调度，在异构平台上实现了有界差异下的公平性，证明了双计数器框架的有效性

Abstract: We address the limitations of current LLM serving with a dual-counter
framework separating user and operator perspectives. The User Fairness Counter
measures quality of service via weighted tokens and latency; the Resource
Fairness Counter measures operational efficiency through throughput and GPU
utilization. Since these metrics are only available post-execution, creating a
scheduling paradox, we introduce a deterministic Mixture of Prediction Experts
(MoPE) framework to predict user-perceived latency, output tokens, throughput,
and GPU utilization. These predictions enable calculation of a unified Holistic
Fairness score that balances both counters through tunable parameters for
proactive fairness-aware scheduling. We implement this in Equinox, an
open-source system with other optimizations like adaptive batching, and
stall-free scheduling. Evaluations on production traces (ShareGPT, LMSYS) and
synthetic workloads demonstrate Equinox achieves up to $1.3\times$ higher
throughput, 60\% lower time-to-first-token latency, and 13\% higher fairness
versus VTC while maintaining 94\% GPU utilization, proving fairness under
bounded discrepancy across heterogeneous platforms.

Motivation: 大规模HPC系统中通信局部性对集合操作性能至关重要，特别是在内部全连接但全局连接稀疏的过载网络上

Method: 提出Bine（二项负二进制）树算法家族，实现基于Bine的八种集合操作

Result: 在四种大规模超级计算机（Dragonfly、Dragonfly+、过载胖树和环面拓扑）上评估，实现最高5倍加速，在不同向量大小和节点数量下持续减少全局链路流量

Conclusion: Bine树算法能有效改善通信局部性，显著减少全局链路流量并提升集合操作性能

Abstract: Communication locality plays a key role in the performance of collective
operations on large HPC systems, especially on oversubscribed networks where
groups of nodes are fully connected internally but sparsely linked through
global connections. We present Bine (binomial negabinary) trees, a family of
collective algorithms that improve communication locality. Bine trees maintain
the generality of binomial trees and butterflies while cutting global-link
traffic by up to 33%. We implement eight Bine-based collectives and evaluate
them on four large-scale supercomputers with Dragonfly, Dragonfly+,
oversubscribed fat-tree, and torus topologies, achieving up to 5x speedups and
consistent reductions in global-link traffic across different vector sizes and
node counts.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: TokenLake是一个统一的段级前缀缓存池系统，通过声明式缓存接口和负载均衡算法，解决了现有前缀缓存系统中的负载不平衡、数据冗余和内存碎片问题，显著提升了吞吐量和命中率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有前缀缓存系统与请求调度紧密耦合，导致跨实例的缓存系统出现负载不平衡、数据冗余和内存碎片问题。内存池化虽然有望解决这些问题，但现有系统只能传输越来越长的前缀缓存，无法实现低延迟内存池化。

Method: 提出TokenLake系统，使用声明式缓存接口暴露查询张量、前缀缓存和缓存感知操作，通过段级缓存管理和基于热点感知的负载均衡算法实现更好的缓存负载平衡、去重和碎片整理，同时最小化通信量。

Result: 在真实工作负载评估中，TokenLake相比最先进的缓存感知路由和缓存中心化PD解耦解决方案，吞吐量分别提升2.6倍和2.0倍，命中率分别提升2.0倍和2.1倍。

Conclusion: TokenLake通过统一的段级前缀缓存池实现了高效的缓存管理，使调度器能够专注于计算优化而不必考虑前缀缓存管理，显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: Prefix caching is crucial to accelerate multi-turn interactions and requests
with shared prefixes. At the cluster level, existing prefix caching systems are
tightly coupled with request scheduling to optimize cache efficiency and
computation performance together, leading to load imbalance, data redundancy,
and memory fragmentation of caching systems across instances. To address these
issues, memory pooling is promising to shield the scheduler from the underlying
cache management so that it can focus on the computation optimization. However,
because existing prefix caching systems only transfer increasingly longer
prefix caches between instances, they cannot achieve low-latency memory
pooling.
  To address these problems, we propose a unified segment-level prefix cache
pool, TokenLake. It uses a declarative cache interface to expose requests'
query tensors, prefix caches, and cache-aware operations to TokenLake for
efficient pooling. Powered by this abstraction, TokenLake can manage prefix
cache at the segment level with a heavy-hitter-aware load balancing algorithm
to achieve better cache load balance, deduplication, and defragmentation.
TokenLake also transparently minimizes the communication volume of query
tensors and new caches. Based on TokenLake, the scheduler can schedule requests
elastically by using existing techniques without considering prefix cache
management. Evaluations on real-world workloads show that TokenLake can improve
throughput by up to 2.6$\times$ and 2.0$\times$ and boost hit rate by
2.0$\times$ and 2.1$\times$, compared to state-of-the-art cache-aware routing
and cache-centric PD-disaggregation solutions, respectively.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 基于SLURM的高性能计算架构，用于部署异构大语言模型到可扩展推理引擎，通过动态资源调度和容器化微服务实现高效资源管理，支持从1B到70B参数模型的高并发推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决在大规模HPC基础设施上高效部署和运行不同规模LLM模型的挑战，需要一种能够动态调度资源、支持高并发且低延迟的推理架构。

Method: 采用SLURM资源管理系统，结合容器化微服务架构，实现CPU、GPU和内存的动态分配，提供REST API端点支持单次和批量推理，以及多步精炼等高级工作流。

Result: 小模型（1B-3B）可处理128个并发请求，延迟低于50ms；大模型（8B-70B）在2个并发用户时达到饱和，延迟超过2秒。容器和调度开销极小，在批处理和交互式场景下均能可靠扩展。

Conclusion: 该架构为大规模HPC基础设施上的LLM推理提供了高效、响应迅速且容错的解决方案，展示了在真实场景中的灵活性和鲁棒性，为未来LLM部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: This work elaborates on a High performance computing (HPC) architecture based
on Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) [1] for deploying
heterogeneous Large Language Models (LLMs) into a scalable inference engine.
Dynamic resource scheduling and seamless integration of containerized
microservices have been leveraged herein to manage CPU, GPU, and memory
allocations efficiently in multi-node clusters. Extensive experiments, using
Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B parameters) [2] and Llama 3.1 (8B and 70B) [3], probe
throughput, latency, and concurrency and show that small models can handle up
to 128 concurrent requests at sub-50 ms latency, while for larger models,
saturation happens with as few as two concurrent users, with a latency of more
than 2 seconds. This architecture includes Representational State Transfer
Application Programming Interfaces (REST APIs) [4] endpoints for single and
bulk inferences, as well as advanced workflows such as multi-step "tribunal"
refinement. Experimental results confirm minimal overhead from container and
scheduling activities and show that the approach scales reliably both for batch
and interactive settings. We further illustrate real-world scenarios, including
the deployment of chatbots with retrievalaugmented generation, which helps to
demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of the architecture. The obtained
results pave ways for significantly more efficient, responsive, and
fault-tolerant LLM inference on large-scale HPC infrastructures.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Flash Sparse Attention (FSA) 是一种新的稀疏注意力内核设计，解决了现有NSA方法在小GQA组大小下的效率问题，在多种现代LLM上实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Native Sparse Attention (NSA) 方法在大GQA组大小时效率很高，但现代LLM通常采用较小的GQA组，这限制了NSA的适用性。需要一种能在各种GQA组大小下都高效运行的稀疏注意力方法。

Method: 提出了Flash Sparse Attention (FSA)，采用替代的内核设计，能够在现代GPU上为各种较小GQA组大小的流行LLM实现高效的NSA计算。

Result: FSA相比原始NSA内核实现了：1) 内核级延迟最高降低3.5倍，平均降低1.6倍；2) 端到端训练速度最高提升1.25倍，平均提升1.09倍；3) 端到端预填充速度最高提升1.36倍，平均提升1.11倍。

Conclusion: FSA成功扩展了稀疏注意力技术的适用性，使其能够在更广泛的LLM架构上实现高效计算，同时保持了与全注意力相当的准确性，为长上下文训练和推理提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent progress in sparse attention mechanisms has demonstrated strong
potential for reducing the computational cost of long-context training and
inference in large language models (LLMs). Native Sparse Attention (NSA), a
state-of-the-art approach, introduces natively trainable, hardware-aligned
sparse attention that delivers substantial system-level performance gains while
maintaining accuracy comparable to full attention. However, the kernel
implementation of NSA relies on a query-grouping strategy that is efficient
only with large Grouped Query Attention (GQA) sizes, whereas modern LLMs
typically adopt much smaller GQA groups, which limits the applicability of this
sparse algorithmic advance. In this work, we propose Flash Sparse Attention
(FSA), which includes an alternative kernel design that enables efficient NSA
computation across a wide range of popular LLMs with varied smaller GQA group
sizes on modern GPUs. Compared to vanilla NSA kernel implementation, our
empirical evaluation demonstrates that FSA achieves (i) up to 3.5$\times$ and
on average 1.6$\times$ kernel-level latency reduction, (ii) up to 1.25$\times$
and 1.09$\times$ on average end-to-end training speedup on state-of-the-art
LLMs, and (iii) up to 1.36$\times$ and 1.11$\times$ on average end-to-end
prefill speedup on state-of-the-art LLMs. The source code is open-sourced and

<details>

Motivation: 解决将基础模型应用于fMRI数据时面临的高维度、计算复杂性、复杂时空动态捕获困难以及间接ROI交互等挑战

Method: 三阶段框架：1)局部掩码自编码器(LMAE)预训练以减少HRF动态影响和噪声；2)随机行走专家混合(RWMOE)模块进行时空特征聚类；3)基于状态空间模型(SSM)的预测器进行下游任务推理

Result: 在Cam-CAN数据集上，年龄预测MAE为5.343(PCC=0.928)，流体智力预测MAE为2.940(PCC=0.887)，优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 该框架为fMRI分析提供了强大且可解释的替代方案，为脑老化和认知功能研究提供了新见解

Abstract: Functional connectivity (FC) derived from resting-state fMRI plays a critical
role in personalized predictions such as age and cognitive performance.
However, applying foundation models(FM) to fMRI data remains challenging due to
its high dimensionality, computational complexity, and the difficulty in
capturing complex spatiotemporal dynamics and indirect region-of-interest (ROI)
interactions. To address these limitations, we propose a modular neuroimaging
framework that integrates principles from FM with efficient, domain-specific
architectures. Our approach begins with a Local Masked Autoencoder (LMAE) for
pretraining, which reduces the influence of hemodynamic response function (HRF)
dynamics and suppresses noise. This is followed by a Random Walk Mixture of
Experts (RWMOE) module that clusters features across spatial and temporal
dimensions, effectively capturing intricate brain interactions. Finally, a
state-space model (SSM)-based predictor performs downstream task inference.
Evaluated on the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN)
dataset, our framework achieved mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 5.343 for age
prediction and 2.940 for fluid intelligence, with Pearson correlation
coefficients (PCCs) of 0.928 and 0.887, respectively-outperforming existing
state-of-the-art methods. Visualization of expert distribution weights further
enhances interpretability by identifying key brain regions. This work provides
a robust, interpretable alternative to LLM-based approaches for fMRI analysis,
offering novel insights into brain aging and cognitive function.

Motivation: 当前的大脑衰老量化方法主要预测年龄或生成合成MRI，但无法捕捉个体特异性衰老轨迹，需要更精确的个性化大脑衰老建模方法。

Method: 结合年龄校准损失、交换学习策略和年龄感知损失，学习纵向大脑衰老动态，从单次基线扫描生成解剖学准确的任意时间点MRI。

Result: 在ADNI和NACC数据集上，BrainPath在结构相似性、均方误差、峰值信噪比和MRI年龄差异准确性方面均优于最先进模型。

Conclusion: BrainPath为个性化大脑衰老映射、合成随访扫描预测和轨迹分析提供了基础，支持神经退行性疾病和衰老干预研究。

Abstract: Quantifying and forecasting individual brain aging trajectories is critical
for understanding neurodegenerative disease and the heterogeneity of aging, yet
current approaches remain limited. Most models predict chronological age, an
imperfect surrogate for biological aging, or generate synthetic MRIs that
enhance data diversity but fail to capture subject-specific trajectories. Here,
we present BrainPath, a 3D generative framework that learns longitudinal brain
aging dynamics during training and, at inference, predicts anatomically
faithful MRIs at arbitrary timepoints from a single baseline scan. BrainPath
integrates an age calibration loss, a swap learning strategy, and an age
perceptual loss to preserve subtle, biologically meaningful variations. Across
held-out ADNI and an independent NACC dataset, BrainPath outperforms
state-of-the-art reference models in structural similarity (SSIM), mean squared
error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and MRI age-difference
accuracy, while capturing realistic and temporally consistent aging patterns.
Beyond methodological innovation, BrainPath enables personalized mapping of
brain aging, synthetic follow-up scan prediction, and trajectory-based
analyses, providing a foundation for precision modeling of brain aging and
supporting research into neurodegeneration and aging interventions.

Conclusion: 可压缩神经粒子方法成功扩展了神经粒子方法的应用范围，为可压缩粘性流体流动提供了稳定准确的数值求解方案

Abstract: Particle methods play an important role in computational fluid dynamics, but
they are among the most difficult to implement and solve. The most common
method is smoothed particle hydrodynamics, which is suitable for problem
settings that involve large deformations, such as tsunamis and dam breaking.
However, the calculation can become unstable depending on the distribution of
particles. In contrast, the neural particle method has high computational
stability for various particle distributions is a machine learning method that
approximates velocity and pressure in a spatial domain using neural networks.
The neural particle method has been extended to viscous flows, but until now it
has been limited to incompressible flows. In this paper, we propose the
compressible neural particle method, which is a new feed-forward neural
network-based method that extends the original neural particle method to model
compressible viscous fluid flows. The proposed method uses neural networks to
calculate the velocity and pressure of fluid particles at the next time step,
and the Tait equation to calculate the density to handle the compressibility.
The loss function is composed of the governing equations of compressible flow
and the boundary conditions, which are free surface and solid boundary
conditions. We demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately solve the
compressible viscous fluid flow, a problem that was difficult to solve with the
smoothed particle hydrodynamics method, by applying it to a dam breaking
problem.

Abstract: In this paper we investigate cross-lingual Text-To-Speech (TTS) synthesis
through the lens of adapters, in the context of lightweight TTS systems. In
particular, we compare the tasks of unseen speaker and language adaptation with
the goal of synthesising a target voice in a target language, in which the
target voice has no recordings therein. Results from objective evaluations
demonstrate the effectiveness of adapters in learning language-specific and
speaker-specific information, allowing pre-trained models to learn unseen
speaker identities or languages, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of the
original model's speaker or language information. Additionally, to measure how
native the generated voices are in terms of accent, we propose and validate an
objective metric inspired by mispronunciation detection techniques in
second-language (L2) learners. The paper also provides insights into the impact
of adapter placement, configuration and the number of speakers used.

Abstract: On-device running Large Language Models (LLMs) is nowadays a critical enabler
towards preserving user privacy. We observe that the attention operator falls
back from the special-purpose NPU to the general-purpose CPU/GPU because of
quantization sensitivity in state-of-the-art frameworks. This fallback results
in a degraded user experience and increased complexity in system scheduling. To
this end, this paper presents shadowAttn, a system-algorithm codesigned sparse
attention module with minimal reliance on CPU/GPU by only sparsely calculating
the attention on a tiny portion of tokens. The key idea is to hide the overhead
of estimating the important tokens with a NPU-based pilot compute. Further,
shadowAttn proposes insightful techniques such as NPU compute graph bucketing,
head-wise NPU-CPU/GPU pipeline and per-head fine-grained sparsity ratio to
achieve high accuracy and efficiency. shadowAttn delivers the best performance
with highly limited CPU/GPU resource; it requires much less CPU/GPU resource to
deliver on-par performance of SoTA frameworks.

Motivation: 虽然存在许多量化方法，但在实际服务条件下对它们的性能、能量和质量权衡缺乏系统性的理解。

Method: 开发了全自动在线表征框架qMeter，对11种后训练LLM量化方法在7B-70B模型规模和A100、H100 GPU架构下进行评估，涵盖应用、工作负载、并行和硬件层面。

Result: 研究发现量化权衡高度依赖于任务和方法，对工作负载特征敏感，且与并行性和GPU架构存在复杂交互。通过三个优化案例研究展示了部署挑战。

Conclusion: 这是首个从性能、能量和质量联合角度对LLM量化进行的全面应用、系统和硬件层面表征研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, but their heavy resource demands make quantization-reducing
precision to lower-bit formats-critical for efficient serving. While many
quantization methods exist, a systematic understanding of their performance,
energy, and quality tradeoffs in realistic serving conditions remains a gap. In
this work, we first develop a fully automated online characterization framework
qMeter, and then conduct an in-depth characterization of 11 post-training LLM
quantization methods across 4 model sizes (7B-70B) and two GPU architectures
(A100, H100). We evaluate quantization at the application, workload,
parallelism, and hardware levels under online serving conditions. Our study
reveals highly task- and method-dependent tradeoffs, strong sensitivity to
workload characteristics, and complex interactions with parallelism and GPU
architecture. We further present three optimization case studies illustrating
deployment challenges in capacity planning, energy-efficient scheduling, and
multi-objective tuning. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first
comprehensive application-, system-, and hardware-level characterization of LLM
quantization from a joint performance, energy, and quality perspective.

TL;DR: 大语言模型在历史文档命名实体识别任务中的零样本和少样本开发表现突出，为缺乏标注数据的历史文本信息提取提供了可行方案


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文本缺乏标注数据且语言变异性大，传统监督方法难以应用，需要探索无需大量训练数据的新方案

Method: 采用零样本和少样本提示策略，在HIPE-2022数据集上对大语言模型进行命名实体识别实验

Result: 大语言模型在历史文档NER任务中表现良好，虽较基于领域特定标注的完全监督模型略差，但结果仍然等待

Conclusion: 大语言模型为低资源或历史重要语料库的信息提取提供了可行高效的替代方案，展现了在传统监督方法不可行情况下的应用潜力

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable versatility across a wide
range of natural language processing tasks and domains. One such task is Named
Entity Recognition (NER), which involves identifying and classifying proper
names in text, such as people, organizations, locations, dates, and other
specific entities. NER plays a crucial role in extracting information from
unstructured textual data, enabling downstream applications such as information
retrieval from unstructured text.
  Traditionally, NER is addressed using supervised machine learning approaches,
which require large amounts of annotated training data. However, historical
texts present a unique challenge, as the annotated datasets are often scarce or
nonexistent, due to the high cost and expertise required for manual labeling.
In addition, the variability and noise inherent in historical language, such as
inconsistent spelling and archaic vocabulary, further complicate the
development of reliable NER systems for these sources.
  In this study, we explore the feasibility of applying LLMs to NER in
historical documents using zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, which
require little to no task-specific training data. Our experiments, conducted on
the HIPE-2022 (Identifying Historical People, Places and other Entities)
dataset, show that LLMs can achieve reasonably strong performance on NER tasks
in this setting. While their performance falls short of fully supervised models
trained on domain-specific annotations, the results are nevertheless promising.
These findings suggest that LLMs offer a viable and efficient alternative for
information extraction in low-resource or historically significant corpora,
where traditional supervised methods are infeasible.

Conclusion: LINCOLN能够有效捕捉现实世界网络的高阶动态特性，在预测任务中表现出色

Abstract: Real-world networks have high-order relationships among objects and they
evolve over time. To capture such dynamics, many works have been studied in a
range of fields. Via an in-depth preliminary analysis, we observe two important
characteristics of high-order dynamics in real-world networks: high-order
relations tend to (O1) have a structural and temporal influence on other
relations in a short term and (O2) periodically re-appear in a long term. In
this paper, we propose LINCOLN, a method for Learning hIgh-order dyNamiCs Of
reaL-world Networks, that employs (1) bi-interactional hyperedge encoding for
short-term patterns, (2) periodic time injection and (3) intermediate node
representation for long-term patterns. Via extensive experiments, we show that
LINCOLN outperforms nine state-of-the-art methods in the dynamic hyperedge
prediction task.

Abstract: Spatial proteomics maps protein distributions in tissues, providing
transformative insights for life sciences. However, current sequencing-based
technologies suffer from low spatial resolution, and substantial inter-tissue
variability in protein expression further compromises the performance of
existing molecular data prediction methods. In this work, we introduce the
novel task of spatial super-resolution for sequencing-based spatial proteomics
(seq-SP) and, to the best of our knowledge, propose the first deep learning
model for this task--Neural Proteomics Fields (NPF). NPF formulates seq-SP as a
protein reconstruction problem in continuous space by training a dedicated
network for each tissue. The model comprises a Spatial Modeling Module, which
learns tissue-specific protein spatial distributions, and a Morphology Modeling
Module, which extracts tissue-specific morphological features. Furthermore, to
facilitate rigorous evaluation, we establish an open-source benchmark dataset,
Pseudo-Visium SP, for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that NPF
achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer learnable parameters,
underscoring its potential for advancing spatial proteomics research. Our code

Motivation: 主题投资面临相关股票选择困难的问题，传统ETF覆盖范围有限，且行业边界重叠、市场动态变化，需要更智能的解决方案。

Method: 构建主题表示集(TRS)数据集，包含主题-股票映射和文本描述；提出THEME层次对比学习框架，先进行语义对齐，再通过时间精炼阶段整合个股收益数据。

Result: THEME在多个检索指标上优于基线方法，显著提升了投资组合构建性能，能够有效检索具有强收益潜力的主题对齐资产。

Conclusion: 通过联合建模文本主题关系和收益市场动态，THEME为复杂投资主题提供了可扩展和自适应的解决方案。

Abstract: Thematic investing aims to construct portfolios aligned with structural
trends, yet selecting relevant stocks remains challenging due to overlapping
sector boundaries and evolving market dynamics. To address this challenge, we
construct the Thematic Representation Set (TRS), an extended dataset that
begins with real-world thematic ETFs and expands upon them by incorporating
industry classifications and financial news to overcome their coverage
limitations. The final dataset contains both the explicit mapping of themes to
their constituent stocks and the rich textual profiles for each. Building on
this dataset, we introduce \textsc{THEME}, a hierarchical contrastive learning
framework. By representing the textual profiles of themes and stocks as
embeddings, \textsc{THEME} first leverages their hierarchical relationship to
achieve semantic alignment. Subsequently, it refines these semantic embeddings
through a temporal refinement stage that incorporates individual stock returns.
The final stock representations are designed for effective retrieval of
thematically aligned assets with strong return potential. Empirical results
show that \textsc{THEME} outperforms strong baselines across multiple retrieval
metrics and significantly improves performance in portfolio construction. By
jointly modeling thematic relationships from text and market dynamics from
returns, \textsc{THEME} provides a scalable and adaptive solution for
navigating complex investment themes.

Abstract: Accurate 3D geometry acquisition is essential for a wide range of
applications, such as computer graphics, autonomous driving, robotics, and
augmented reality. However, raw point clouds acquired in real-world
environments are often corrupted with noise due to various factors such as
sensor, lighting, material, environment etc, which reduces geometric fidelity
and degrades downstream performance. Point cloud denoising is a fundamental
problem, aiming to recover clean point sets while preserving underlying
structures. Classical optimization-based methods, guided by hand-crafted
filters or geometric priors, have been extensively studied but struggle to
handle diverse and complex noise patterns. Recent deep learning approaches
leverage neural network architectures to learn distinctive representations and
demonstrate strong outcomes, particularly on complex and large-scale point
clouds. Provided these significant advances, this survey provides a
comprehensive and up-to-date review of deep learning-based point cloud
denoising methods up to August 2025. We organize the literature from two
perspectives: (1) supervision level (supervised vs. unsupervised), and (2)
modeling perspective, proposing a functional taxonomy that unifies diverse
approaches by their denoising principles. We further analyze architectural
trends both structurally and chronologically, establish a unified benchmark
with consistent training settings, and evaluate methods in terms of denoising
quality, surface fidelity, point distribution, and computational efficiency.
Finally, we discuss open challenges and outline directions for future research
in this rapidly evolving field.

Result: 在新建的DanceRemix数据集上进行了广泛实验，证明该方法优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: DanceEditor框架能够生成既符合音乐节奏又与文本描述语义对齐的可编辑舞蹈，为实际编舞应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Generating coherent and diverse human dances from music signals has gained
tremendous progress in animating virtual avatars. While existing methods
support direct dance synthesis, they fail to recognize that enabling users to
edit dance movements is far more practical in real-world choreography
scenarios. Moreover, the lack of high-quality dance datasets incorporating
iterative editing also limits addressing this challenge. To achieve this goal,
we first construct DanceRemix, a large-scale multi-turn editable dance dataset
comprising the prompt featuring over 25.3M dance frames and 84.5K pairs. In
addition, we propose a novel framework for iterative and editable dance
generation coherently aligned with given music signals, namely DanceEditor.
Considering the dance motion should be both musical rhythmic and enable
iterative editing by user descriptions, our framework is built upon a
prediction-then-editing paradigm unifying multi-modal conditions. At the
initial prediction stage, our framework improves the authority of generated
results by directly modeling dance movements from tailored, aligned music.
Moreover, at the subsequent iterative editing stages, we incorporate text
descriptions as conditioning information to draw the editable results through a
specifically designed Cross-modality Editing Module (CEM). Specifically, CEM
adaptively integrates the initial prediction with music and text prompts as
temporal motion cues to guide the synthesized sequences. Thereby, the results
display music harmonics while preserving fine-grained semantic alignment with
text descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art models on our newly collected DanceRemix
dataset. Code is available at https://lzvsdy.github.io/DanceEditor/.

Conclusion: MeshSplat框架成功解决了稀疏视图下的表面重建问题，通过2D高斯溅射桥接新视角合成和几何先验学习，为稀疏视图几何重建提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Surface reconstruction has been widely studied in computer vision and
graphics. However, existing surface reconstruction works struggle to recover
accurate scene geometry when the input views are extremely sparse. To address
this issue, we propose MeshSplat, a generalizable sparse-view surface
reconstruction framework via Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to leverage
2DGS as a bridge, which connects novel view synthesis to learned geometric
priors and then transfers these priors to achieve surface reconstruction.
Specifically, we incorporate a feed-forward network to predict per-view
pixel-aligned 2DGS, which enables the network to synthesize novel view images
and thus eliminates the need for direct 3D ground-truth supervision. To improve
the accuracy of 2DGS position and orientation prediction, we propose a Weighted
Chamfer Distance Loss to regularize the depth maps, especially in overlapping
areas of input views, and also a normal prediction network to align the
orientation of 2DGS with normal vectors predicted by a monocular normal
estimator. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed
improvement, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in generalizable sparse-view mesh reconstruction tasks. Project

Motivation: 解决传统集中式多智能体系统对规划器能力依赖过强、智能体间通信效率低下的问题

Method: 基于Coral Protocol的A2A通信MCP服务器，实现结构化直接协作，支持实时进度监控、结果评估和计划调整

Result: 在GAIA基准测试中达到52.73%准确率，使用小型LLM(GPT-4.1-mini)作为规划器，比最强开源基线OWL(43.63%)提升9.09%

Conclusion: Anemoi通过半集中式架构和直接通信机制，显著提升了多智能体系统的可扩展性和成本效率

Abstract: Recent advances in generalist multi-agent systems (MAS) have largely followed
a context-engineering plus centralized paradigm, where a planner agent
coordinates multiple worker agents through unidirectional prompt passing. While
effective under strong planner models, this design suffers from two critical
limitations: (1) strong dependency on the planner's capability, which leads to
degraded performance when a smaller LLM powers the planner; and (2) limited
inter-agent communication, where collaboration relies on costly prompt
concatenation and context injection, introducing redundancy and information
loss. To address these challenges, we propose Anemoi, a semi-centralized MAS
built on the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication MCP server from Coral Protocol.
Unlike traditional designs, Anemoi enables structured and direct inter-agent
collaboration, allowing all agents to monitor progress, assess results,
identify bottlenecks, and propose refinements in real time. This paradigm
reduces reliance on a single planner, supports adaptive plan updates, and
minimizes redundant context passing, resulting in more scalable and
cost-efficient execution. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Anemoi achieved
52.73\% accuracy with a small LLM (GPT-4.1-mini) as the planner, surpassing the
strongest open-source baseline OWL (43.63\%) by +9.09\% under identical LLM
settings. Our implementation is publicly available at

TL;DR: 本文研究了LLM生成内容对基于术语的检索模型的影响，发现这些模型优先选择与查询术语分布最匹配的文档，而非对特定来源存在固有偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM生成内容在互联网中激增，信息检索系统需要处理人机混合文本。研究发现神经检索器偏好LLM生成内容，而经典术语检索器如BM25偏好人类撰写文档，需要深入理解这种偏好的本质。

Method: 通过语言分析比较LLM生成文本和人类撰写文本的统计特征差异，包括Zipf斜率、术语特异性和文档多样性，并探究术语检索模型是否存在来源偏见。

Result: LLM生成文本具有更平滑的高频Zipf斜率、更陡峭的低频Zipf斜率、更高的术语特异性和更大的文档级多样性。术语检索模型优先选择术语分布与查询最匹配的文档，而非显示固有来源偏见。

Conclusion: 术语检索模型的偏好源于文档与查询的术语分布匹配度，而非对特定来源的固有偏见。这为理解和处理混合来源内容中的潜在偏见提供了基础。

Abstract: As more content generated by large language models (LLMs) floods into the
Internet, information retrieval (IR) systems now face the challenge of
distinguishing and handling a blend of human-authored and machine-generated
texts. Recent studies suggest that neural retrievers may exhibit a preferential
inclination toward LLM-generated content, while classic term-based retrievers
like BM25 tend to favor human-written documents. This paper investigates the
influence of LLM-generated content on term-based retrieval models, which are
valued for their efficiency and robust generalization across domains. Our
linguistic analysis reveals that LLM-generated texts exhibit smoother
high-frequency and steeper low-frequency Zipf slopes, higher term specificity,
and greater document-level diversity. These traits are aligned with LLMs being
trained to optimize reader experience through diverse and precise expressions.
Our study further explores whether term-based retrieval models demonstrate
source bias, concluding that these models prioritize documents whose term
distributions closely correspond to those of the queries, rather than
displaying an inherent source bias. This work provides a foundation for
understanding and addressing potential biases in term-based IR systems managing
mixed-source content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态检索器在处理私有文档、未知领域或语言时表现不佳，需要一种能够利用MLLM广泛知识来提升检索效果的新方法。

Method: 利用多模态大语言模型生成跨模态预问题(preQs)，通过多个互补模态的问题在token级别扩展匹配范围，而不是在单一向量空间中进行嵌入比较。

Result: 在分布外基准测试（包括封闭领域和多语言设置）中实现了最先进的性能，在所有检索指标上都优于强基线模型。

Conclusion: PREMIR框架通过生成跨模态预问题有效提升了多模态检索的鲁棒性和性能，特别是在处理现实世界中的私有文档和跨域检索任务时表现出色。

Abstract: Rapid advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have expanded
information retrieval beyond purely textual inputs, enabling retrieval from
complex real world documents that combine text and visuals. However, most
documents are private either owned by individuals or confined within corporate
silos and current retrievers struggle when faced with unseen domains or
languages. To address this gap, we introduce PREMIR, a simple yet effective
framework that leverages the broad knowledge of an MLLM to generate cross modal
pre questions (preQs) before retrieval. Unlike earlier multimodal retrievers
that compare embeddings in a single vector space, PREMIR leverages preQs from
multiple complementary modalities to expand the scope of matching to the token
level. Experiments show that PREMIR achieves state of the art performance on
out of distribution benchmarks, including closed domain and multilingual
settings, outperforming strong baselines across all retrieval metrics. We
confirm the contribution of each component through in depth ablation studies,
and qualitative analyses of the generated preQs further highlight the model's
robustness in real world settings.

TL;DR: HLLM-Creator是一个分层LLM框架，通过用户聚类和匹配预测剪枝策略实现高效个性化内容生成，解决了AIGC系统在用户兴趣建模和数据稀缺方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AIGC系统过度依赖创作者灵感，无法生成真正用户个性化的内容。在线广告等实际应用中，不同用户关注不同产品特性，个性化创意生成具有重要价值。

Method: 提出分层LLM框架HLLM-Creator，采用用户聚类和用户-广告匹配预测剪枝策略提高生成效率，并设计基于思维链推理的数据构建管道来生成高质量个性化创意标题。

Result: 在抖音搜索广告个性化标题生成实验中表现有效，在线A/B测试显示广告转化率提升0.476%，证明了该方法在大规模工业部署中的可行性。

Conclusion: HLLM-Creator为工业场景中更有效和高效的个性化生成铺平了道路，解决了用户兴趣建模、事实一致性和数据稀缺等关键挑战。

Abstract: AI-generated content technologies are widely used in content creation.
However, current AIGC systems rely heavily on creators' inspiration, rarely
generating truly user-personalized content. In real-world applications such as
online advertising, a single product may have multiple selling points, with
different users focusing on different features. This underscores the
significant value of personalized, user-centric creative generation. Effective
personalized content generation faces two main challenges: (1) accurately
modeling user interests and integrating them into the content generation
process while adhering to factual constraints, and (2) ensuring high efficiency
and scalability to handle the massive user base in industrial scenarios.
Additionally, the scarcity of personalized creative data in practice
complicates model training, making data construction another key hurdle. We
propose HLLM-Creator, a hierarchical LLM framework for efficient user interest
modeling and personalized content generation. During inference, a combination
of user clustering and a user-ad-matching-prediction based pruning strategy is
employed to significantly enhance generation efficiency and reduce
computational overhead, making the approach suitable for large-scale
deployment. Moreover, we design a data construction pipeline based on
chain-of-thought reasoning, which generates high-quality, user-specific
creative titles and ensures factual consistency despite limited personalized
data. This pipeline serves as a critical foundation for the effectiveness of
our model. Extensive experiments on personalized title generation for Douyin
Search Ads show the effectiveness of HLLM-Creator. Online A/B test shows a
0.476% increase on Adss, paving the way for more effective and efficient
personalized generation in industrial scenarios. Codes for academic dataset are

*Hongtao Lin,Haoyu Chen,Jaewon Jang,Jiajing Xu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种条件检索方法，在双塔模型基础上引入物品侧信息作为查询条件，能够基于主题等条件进行个性化检索，在Pinterest部署后带来0.26%的周活跃用户增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统中的用户-物品检索研究活跃，双塔模型因简洁高效被广泛采用。本文关注条件检索问题，即要求检索结果与特定条件（如主题）相关，需要开发能够有效利用条件信息的检索方法。

Method: 使用与标准双塔模型相同的训练数据，但在查询中引入物品侧信息作为条件。这种方法能够自举新的条件检索用例，并促进用户特征与条件特征之间的交互。

Result: 实验表明该方法能够检索到高度相关的物品，在参与度指标上优于带过滤器的标准双塔模型。模型已部署到Pinterest的基于主题的通知feed中。

Conclusion: 提出的条件检索方法有效提升了检索质量，实际部署带来了显著的活跃用户增长（+0.26%周活用户），证明了条件检索在推荐系统中的实用价值。

Abstract: User-to-item retrieval has been an active research area in recommendation
system, and two tower models are widely adopted due to model simplicity and
serving efficiency. In this work, we focus on a variant called
\textit{conditional retrieval}, where we expect retrieved items to be relevant
to a condition (e.g. topic). We propose a method that uses the same training
data as standard two tower models but incorporates item-side information as
conditions in query. This allows us to bootstrap new conditional retrieval use
cases and encourages feature interactions between user and condition.
Experiments show that our method can retrieve highly relevant items and
outperforms standard two tower models with filters on engagement metrics. The
proposed model is deployed to power a topic-based notification feed at
Pinterest and led to +0.26\% weekly active users.

TL;DR: DiffusionGS是一个基于生成模型的个性化搜索排序方法，通过将用户查询作为意图锚点，使用条件扩散过程从用户历史行为中提取实时兴趣表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在基于历史行为估计用户广泛兴趣方面表现良好，但未能充分利用用户实时意图（查询）与过去行为之间的显式对齐关系。

Method: 将兴趣提取建模为条件去噪任务，用户查询指导条件扩散过程从行为序列中生成鲁棒的用户意图感知表示。提出用户感知去噪层（UDL）将用户特定配置文件整合到注意力分布优化中。

Result: 离线和在线实验表明DiffusionGS优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过将查询重新定义为意图先验并利用基于扩散的去噪，该方法为捕捉动态用户兴趣变化提供了强大机制。

Abstract: Personalized search ranking systems are critical for driving engagement and
revenue in modern e-commerce and short-video platforms. While existing methods
excel at estimating users' broad interests based on the filtered historical
behaviors, they typically under-exploit explicit alignment between a user's
real-time intent (represented by the user query) and their past actions. In
this paper, we propose DiffusionGS, a novel and scalable approach powered by
generative models. Our key insight is that user queries can serve as explicit
intent anchors to facilitate the extraction of users' immediate interests from
long-term, noisy historical behaviors. Specifically, we formulate interest
extraction as a conditional denoising task, where the user's query guides a
conditional diffusion process to produce a robust, user intent-aware
representation from their behavioral sequence. We propose the User-aware
Denoising Layer (UDL) to incorporate user-specific profiles into the
optimization of attention distribution on the user's past actions. By reframing
queries as intent priors and leveraging diffusion-based denoising, our method
provides a powerful mechanism for capturing dynamic user interest shifts.
Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate the superiority of
DiffusionGS over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: HyST是一个混合检索框架，结合LLM驱动的结构化过滤和语义嵌入搜索，用于处理半结构化表格数据上的复杂查询


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实推荐系统中的用户查询往往结合结构化约束（如类别、属性）和非结构化偏好（如产品描述或评论），需要一种能够同时处理这两种信息需求的解决方案

Method: 使用大语言模型从自然语言中提取属性级约束作为元数据过滤器，同时通过基于嵌入的检索处理剩余的非结构化查询组件

Result: 在半结构化基准测试中，HyST始终优于传统基线方法，显著提高了检索精度

Conclusion: HyST提供了一个可扩展且准确的解决方案，突出了结构化过滤在提高检索精度方面的重要性

Abstract: User queries in real-world recommendation systems often combine structured
constraints (e.g., category, attributes) with unstructured preferences (e.g.,
product descriptions or reviews). We introduce HyST (Hybrid retrieval over
Semi-structured Tabular data), a hybrid retrieval framework that combines
LLM-powered structured filtering with semantic embedding search to support
complex information needs over semi-structured tabular data. HyST extracts
attribute-level constraints from natural language using large language models
(LLMs) and applies them as metadata filters, while processing the remaining
unstructured query components via embedding-based retrieval. Experiments on a
semi-structured benchmark show that HyST consistently outperforms tradtional
baselines, highlighting the importance of structured filtering in improving
retrieval precision, offering a scalable and accurate solution for real-world
user queries.

TL;DR: 提出了一种将测试时缩放技术应用于多轮对话多模态产品检索的新框架，通过测试时重排序机制提升检索准确性和用户意图对齐


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统产品检索系统难以处理复杂的多轮用户交互，现有方法主要针对单轮场景，在多轮对话中难以建模演变的用户意图，且测试时缩放技术在对话产品搜索中难以直接应用

Method: 基于生成式检索器，引入测试时重排序(TTR)机制，通过迭代推理时优化来改进检索准确性，更好地与对话过程中演变的用户意图对齐

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得一致改进，MRR平均提升14.5个百分点，nDCG@1平均提升10.6个百分点

Conclusion: 测试时缩放技术可以有效提升多轮对话多模态产品检索的性能，特别是在处理模糊和演变的用户查询时表现出显著优势

Abstract: The rapid evolution of e-commerce has exposed the limitations of traditional
product retrieval systems in managing complex, multi-turn user interactions.
Recent advances in multimodal generative retrieval -- particularly those
leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as retrievers -- have shown
promise. However, most existing methods are tailored to single-turn scenarios
and struggle to model the evolving intent and iterative nature of multi-turn
dialogues when applied naively. Concurrently, test-time scaling has emerged as
a powerful paradigm for improving large language model (LLM) performance
through iterative inference-time refinement. Yet, its effectiveness typically
relies on two conditions: (1) a well-defined problem space (e.g., mathematical
reasoning), and (2) the model's ability to self-correct -- conditions that are
rarely met in conversational product search. In this setting, user queries are
often ambiguous and evolving, and MLLMs alone have difficulty grounding
responses in a fixed product corpus. Motivated by these challenges, we propose
a novel framework that introduces test-time scaling into conversational
multimodal product retrieval. Our approach builds on a generative retriever,
further augmented with a test-time reranking (TTR) mechanism that improves
retrieval accuracy and better aligns results with evolving user intent
throughout the dialogue. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show consistent
improvements, with average gains of 14.5 points in MRR and 10.6 points in
nDCG@1.

TL;DR: PCR-CA是一个端到端的CTR预测框架，通过并行码本表示和对比对齐来解决多类别应用的语义重叠问题，显著提升了推荐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统应用商店推荐系统在处理多类别应用时效果不佳，因为传统分类法无法捕捉重叠语义，导致个性化推荐效果不理想。

Method: 提出PCR-CA框架：1)提取多模态嵌入；2)并行码本VQ-AE模块学习离散语义表示；3)对比对齐损失桥接语义和协同信号；4)双注意力融合机制结合ID和语义特征。

Result: 在大规模数据集上实现+0.76% AUC提升，长尾应用提升+2.15% AUC。在线A/B测试显示CTR提升+10.52%，CVR提升+16.30%。

Conclusion: PCR-CA框架有效解决了多类别应用的语义建模问题，已在微软应用商店全面部署，证明了其在真实场景中的有效性。

Abstract: Modern app store recommender systems struggle with multiple-category apps, as
traditional taxonomies fail to capture overlapping semantics, leading to
suboptimal personalization. We propose PCR-CA (Parallel Codebook
Representations with Contrastive Alignment), an end-to-end framework for
improved CTR prediction. PCR-CA first extracts compact multimodal embeddings
from app text, then introduces a Parallel Codebook VQ-AE module that learns
discrete semantic representations across multiple codebooks in parallel --
unlike hierarchical residual quantization (RQ-VAE). This design enables
independent encoding of diverse aspects (e.g., gameplay, art style), better
modeling multiple-category semantics. To bridge semantic and collaborative
signals, we employ a contrastive alignment loss at both the user and item
levels, enhancing representation learning for long-tail items. Additionally, a
dual-attention fusion mechanism combines ID-based and semantic features to
capture user interests, especially for long-tail apps. Experiments on a
large-scale dataset show PCR-CA achieves a +0.76% AUC improvement over strong
baselines, with +2.15% AUC gains for long-tail apps. Online A/B testing further
validates our approach, showing a +10.52% lift in CTR and a +16.30% improvement
in CVR, demonstrating PCR-CA's effectiveness in real-world deployment. The new
framework has now been fully deployed on the Microsoft Store.

Main category: q-fin.TR

TL;DR: 本文扩展了做市商策略空间，允许偶尔不报价或提供单边报价，通过对抗性强化学习训练，证明这种灵活性可以改善收益和夏普比率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统做市商策略假设持续双边报价，但实践中做市商并不需要始终报价。本文旨在丰富做市商的策略选择，允许其根据市场条件灵活选择是否报价或提供单边报价。

Method: 设计了两种新型做市商代理：第一种可以选择提供双边报价或拒绝报价；第二种可以选择提供双边报价、拒绝报价、或仅提供单边买/卖报价。采用模型驱动方法在对抗性环境中比较性能。

Result: 偶尔拒绝提供双边报价可以改善收益和/或夏普比率。训练良好的做市商报价比率可达99.9%，满足任何市场要求。

Conclusion: 扩展做市商行动空间，允许灵活报价策略，能够在对抗性市场环境中获得更好的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Market making is a popular trading strategy, which aims to generate profit
from the spread between the quotes posted at either side of the market. It has
been shown that training market makers (MMs) with adversarial reinforcement
learning allows to overcome the risks due to changing market conditions and to
lead to robust performances. Prior work assumes, however, that MMs keep quoting
throughout the trading process, but in practice this is not required, even for
``registered'' MMs (that only need to satisfy quoting ratios defined by the
market rules). In this paper, we build on this line of work and enrich the
strategy space of the MM by allowing to occasionally not quote or provide
single-sided quotes. Towards this end, in addition to the MM agents that
provide continuous bid-ask quotes, we have designed two new agents with
increasingly richer action spaces. The first has the option to provide bid-ask
quotes or refuse to quote. The second has the option to provide bid-ask quotes,
refuse to quote, or only provide single-sided ask or bid quotes. We employ a
model-driven approach to empirically compare the performance of the
continuously quoting MM with the two agents above in various types of
adversarial environments. We demonstrate how occasional refusal to provide
bid-ask quotes improves returns and/or Sharpe ratios. The quoting ratios of
well-trained MMs can basically meet any market requirements, reaching up to
99.9$\%$ in some cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改善市场制造商策略的适应性和稳健性，通过使用更现实的市场模拟和灵活报价机制来更好地抓取市场动态和自激行为。

Method: 使用霍克斯过程替代普遍的波松过程，结合对抗性强化学习训练市场制造商策略，扩大动作空间（双向报价、单向报价或不报价），并在波动率2和200的条件下进行评估。

Result: 在低波动环境中训练的4动作市场制造商能够有效适应高波动条件，保持稳定性能并在至少92%的时间提供双向报价。

Conclusion: 结合灵活报价机制和现实市场模拟显著提升了市场制造商策略的效果。

Abstract: We advance market-making strategies by integrating Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning (ARL), Hawkes Processes, and variable volatility levels while also
expanding the action space available to market makers (MMs). To enhance the
adaptability and robustness of these strategies -- which can quote always,
quote only on one side of the market or not quote at all -- we shift from the
commonly used Poisson process to the Hawkes process, which better captures real
market dynamics and self-exciting behaviors. We then train and evaluate
strategies under volatility levels of 2 and 200. Our findings show that the
4-action MM trained in a low-volatility environment effectively adapts to
high-volatility conditions, maintaining stable performance and providing
two-sided quotes at least 92\% of the time. This indicates that incorporating
flexible quoting mechanisms and realistic market simulations significantly
enhances the effectiveness of market-making strategies.

TL;DR: 提出结合梯级LOB表征管道和监督对比学习的表征学习框架，用于检测金融市场中的假招操纵行为，特别是多级异常模式的spoofing操纵


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融市场对全球经济稳定至关重要，但交易型操纵(TBM)媒体市场公平性。Spoofing作为一种欺骗性TBM策略，展现出多级异常模式，但这些模式往往隐藏在高维度、噪音丰富的限价订单籍(LOB)信息中，难以有效利用

Method: 设计了一个表征学习框架，结合梯级LOB表征管道和监督对比学习方法，用于提取和利用LOB中的层次信息来检测spoofing操纵

Result: 大量实验表明，该框架在各种模型上都持续提高了检测性能，以Transformer为基础的架构达到了最先进水平。系统分析和消融研究揭示了多级异常模式和关键组成部分的贡献

Conclusion: 该研究为复杂序列数据的表征学习和异常检测提供了更广泛的见解，有效解决了金融市场中spoofing操纵检测的挑战

Abstract: Financial markets are critical to global economic stability, yet trade-based
manipulation (TBM) often undermines their fairness. Spoofing, a particularly
deceptive TBM strategy, exhibits multilevel anomaly patterns that have not been
adequately modeled. These patterns are usually concealed within the rich,
hierarchical information of the Limit Order Book (LOB), which is challenging to
leverage due to high dimensionality and noise. To address this, we propose a
representation learning framework combining a cascaded LOB representation
pipeline with supervised contrastive learning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework consistently improves detection performance
across diverse models, with Transformer-based architectures achieving
state-of-the-art results. In addition, we conduct systematic analyses and
ablation studies to investigate multilevel anomalies and the contributions of
key components, offering broader insights into representation learning and
anomaly detection for complex sequential data. Our code will be released later

Abstract: Generative models are a promising tool to produce cosmological simulations
but face significant challenges in scalability, physical consistency, and
adherence to domain symmetries, limiting their utility as alternatives to
$N$-body simulations. To address these limitations, we introduce a score-based
generative model with an equivariant graph neural network that simulates
gravitational clustering of galaxies across cosmologies starting from an
informed prior, respects periodic boundaries, and scales to full galaxy counts
in simulations. A novel topology-aware noise schedule, crucial for large
geometric graphs, is introduced. The proposed equivariant score-based model
successfully generates full-scale cosmological point clouds of up to 600,000
halos, respects periodicity and a uniform prior, and outperforms existing
diffusion models in capturing clustering statistics while offering significant
computational advantages. This work advances cosmology by introducing a
generative model designed to closely resemble the underlying gravitational
clustering of structure formation, moving closer to physically realistic and
efficient simulators for the evolution of large-scale structures in the
universe.

TL;DR: 惩罚机制对合作的影响具有显著异质性：虽然总能增加贡献，但对效率的影响从提升43%到降低44%不等，取决于具体合作情境。研究发现沟通是最具预测性的特征，且多数特征通过交互作用影响惩罚效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 惩罚作为促进合作的机制已研究20多年，但其有效性仍存在争议。研究旨在系统考察惩罚在不同合作情境下的效果差异。

Method: 通过大规模整合实验，在公共物品游戏中变化14个参数，采样360个实验条件，收集7,100名参与者的147,618个决策。开发预测模型并与人类预测进行比较。

Result: 惩罚效果存在显著异质性：贡献率总是增加，但效率影响从+43%到-44%不等。沟通是最强预测因子，其次是贡献框架、贡献类型、游戏长度等因素。多数特征通过交互作用影响效果。

Conclusion: 研究将惩罚辩论从"是否有效"转向"在何种条件下有效"，展示了整合实验与机器学习结合能发现复杂社会现象中的可推广模式和新解释。

Abstract: Punishment as a mechanism for promoting cooperation has been studied
extensively for more than two decades, but its effectiveness remains a matter
of dispute. Here, we examine how punishment's impact varies across cooperative
settings through a large-scale integrative experiment. We vary 14 parameters
that characterize public goods games, sampling 360 experimental conditions and
collecting 147,618 decisions from 7,100 participants. Our results reveal
striking heterogeneity in punishment effectiveness: while punishment
consistently increases contributions, its impact on payoffs (i.e., efficiency)
ranges from dramatically enhancing welfare (up to 43% improvement) to severely
undermining it (up to 44% reduction) depending on the cooperative context. To
characterize these patterns, we developed models that outperformed human
forecasters (laypeople and domain experts) in predicting punishment outcomes in
new experiments. Communication emerged as the most predictive feature, followed
by contribution framing (opt-out vs. opt-in), contribution type (variable vs.
all-or-nothing), game length (number of rounds), peer outcome visibility
(whether participants can see others' earnings), and the availability of a
reward mechanism. Interestingly, however, most of these features interact to
influence punishment effectiveness rather than operating independently. For
example, the extent to which longer games increase the effectiveness of
punishment depends on whether groups can communicate. Together, our results
refocus the debate over punishment from whether or not it "works" to the
specific conditions under which it does and does not work. More broadly, our
study demonstrates how integrative experiments can be combined with machine
learning to uncover generalizable patterns, potentially involving interactions
between multiple features, and help generate novel explanations in complex
social phenomena.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验结果表明了该方法的有效性

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了图级学习任务中的不确定性量化问题，为模型提供了更安全的决策能力

Abstract: Accurate modelling and quantification of predictive uncertainty is crucial in
deep learning since it allows a model to make safer decisions when the data is
ambiguous and facilitates the users' understanding of the model's confidence in
its predictions. Along with the tremendously increasing research focus on
\emph{graph neural networks} (GNNs) in recent years, there have been numerous
techniques which strive to capture the uncertainty in their predictions.
However, most of these approaches are specifically designed for node or
link-level tasks and cannot be directly applied to graph-level learning
problems. In this paper, we propose a novel variational modelling framework for
the \emph{posterior predictive distribution}~(PPD) to obtain uncertainty-aware
prediction in graph-level learning tasks. Based on a graph-level embedding
derived from one of the existing GNNs, our framework can learn the PPD in a
data-adaptive fashion. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets
exhibit the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Standard techniques for aligning large language models (LLMs) utilize
human-produced data, which could limit the capability of any aligned LLM to
human level. Label refinement and weak training have emerged as promising
strategies to address this superalignment problem. In this work, we adopt
probabilistic assumptions commonly used to study label refinement and analyze
whether refinement can be outperformed by alternative approaches, including
computationally intractable oracle methods. We show that both weak training and
label refinement suffer from irreducible error, leaving a performance gap
between label refinement and the oracle. These results motivate future research
into developing alternative methods for weak to strong generalization that
synthesize the practicality of label refinement or weak training and the
optimality of the oracle procedure.

TL;DR: 提出CP4SBI框架，通过保形校准方法解决模拟推断中后验分布校准不足的问题，提供有限样本局部覆盖保证


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前实验科学家越来越多地依赖模拟推断(SBI)来反演具有难处理似然的复杂非线性模型，但SBI获得的后验近似往往校准不足，导致置信区域无法覆盖真实参数

Method: 开发模型无关的保形校准框架CP4SBI，提出两种变体：基于回归树的局部校准和基于CDF的校准，可为任何评分函数构建具有局部贝叶斯覆盖的置信集

Result: 在广泛使用的SBI基准测试中，该方法提高了使用归一化流和分数扩散建模的神经后验估计器的不确定性量化质量

Conclusion: CP4SBI框架能够有效改善模拟推断中后验估计的校准问题，提供可靠的置信区域覆盖保证

Abstract: Current experimental scientists have been increasingly relying on
simulation-based inference (SBI) to invert complex non-linear models with
intractable likelihoods. However, posterior approximations obtained with SBI
are often miscalibrated, causing credible regions to undercover true
parameters. We develop $\texttt{CP4SBI}$, a model-agnostic conformal
calibration framework that constructs credible sets with local Bayesian
coverage. Our two proposed variants, namely local calibration via regression
trees and CDF-based calibration, enable finite-sample local coverage guarantees
for any scoring function, including HPD, symmetric, and quantile-based regions.
Experiments on widely used SBI benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
improves the quality of uncertainty quantification for neural posterior
estimators using both normalizing flows and score-diffusion modeling.

Motivation: 现代概率模型依赖SDE，但存在稳定性问题、有界域外归纳偏置较差、以及依赖限制性动力学或训练技巧等问题

Method: 在系统性空间上构建新型神经SDE，具有连续动力学特性，支持高阶汇率汇算器

Conclusion: 该方法为SDE模型提供了更稳定、更高效的解决方案，将推动SDE在概率模型中的更广泛应用

Abstract: Many modern probabilistic models rely on SDEs, but their adoption is hampered
by instability, poor inductive bias outside bounded domains, and reliance on
restrictive dynamics or training tricks. While recent work constrains SDEs to
compact spaces using reflected dynamics, these approaches lack continuous
dynamics and efficient high-order solvers, limiting interpretability and
applicability. We propose a novel class of neural SDEs on compact polyhedral
spaces with continuous dynamics, amenable to higher-order solvers, and with
favorable inductive bias.

<details>

Motivation: 传统差分隐私定义主要基于密度散度，作者希望从信息几何学的新视角来定义隐私，探索Rao距离作为隐私度量的潜力

Method: 采用信息几何学中的Rao距离来定义隐私，替代传统的密度散度方法，建立基于几何距离的隐私框架

Result: 提出的基于Rao距离的隐私定义保持了传统隐私解释的有效性，同时在序列组合方面表现出改进的性能

Conclusion: 信息几何学视角为差分隐私提供了新的定义框架，Rao距离作为隐私度量工具具有理论优势，特别是在组合性方面优于传统方法

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) has recently emerged as a definition of privacy to
release private estimates. DP calibrates noise to be on the order of an
individuals contribution. Due to the this calibration a private estimate
obscures any individual while preserving the utility of the estimate. Since the
original definition, many alternate definitions have been proposed. These
alternates have been proposed for various reasons including improvements on
composition results, relaxations, and formalizations. Nevertheless, thus far
nearly all definitions of privacy have used a divergence of densities as the
basis of the definition. In this paper we take an information geometry
perspective towards differential privacy. Specifically, rather than define
privacy via a divergence, we define privacy via the Rao distance. We show that
our proposed definition of privacy shares the interpretation of previous
definitions of privacy while improving on sequential composition.

TL;DR: 提出FIDDLE方法，使用FAST-NN深度学习估计器结合AIPW框架，在高维相关协变量下估计平均处理效应，具有模型错误设定鲁棒性和半参数效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维、高度相关、稀疏非线性协变量下平均处理效应(ATE)估计的挑战，传统方法在这种情况下表现不佳。

Method: 使用FAST-NN深度学习估计器分别估计响应函数和倾向得分，基于AIPW框架构建FIDDLE估计器，能够非参数选择变量并自适应学习低维函数结构。

Result: FIDDLE在模型错误设定下仍能一致估计ATE，达到半参数效率，在高维数据下优于传统方法，数值实验验证了理论保证。

Conclusion: FIDDLE提供了一个灵活有效的ATE估计框架，特别适用于高维复杂数据环境，为因果推断提供了新的深度学习解决方案。

Abstract: We investigate the problem of estimating the average treatment effect (ATE)
under a very general setup where the covariates can be high-dimensional, highly
correlated, and can have sparse nonlinear effects on the propensity and outcome
models. We present the use of a Double Deep Learning strategy for estimation,
which involves combining recently developed factor-augmented deep
learning-based estimators, FAST-NN, for both the response functions and
propensity scores to achieve our goal. By using FAST-NN, our method can select
variables that contribute to propensity and outcome models in a completely
nonparametric and algorithmic manner and adaptively learn low-dimensional
function structures through neural networks. Our proposed novel estimator,
FIDDLE (Factor Informed Double Deep Learning Estimator), estimates ATE based on
the framework of augmented inverse propensity weighting AIPW with the
FAST-NN-based response and propensity estimates. FIDDLE consistently estimates
ATE even under model misspecification and is flexible to also allow for
low-dimensional covariates. Our method achieves semiparametric efficiency under
a very flexible family of propensity and outcome models. We present extensive
numerical studies on synthetic and real datasets to support our theoretical
guarantees and establish the advantages of our methods over other traditional
choices, especially when the data dimension is large.

Motivation: 多目标学习中多个预测任务需要联合解决，使用更大容量的模型会增加统计成本，本文旨在研究这种成本是否可以通过半监督学习来避免。

Method: 通过理论分析证明不同损失函数下的统计成本特性，并提出基于伪标记的简单半监督算法。

Result: 对于某些损失函数，模型复杂度成本不可避免；但对于Bregman损失，未标记数据可以显著减少标记数据需求，并建立了样本复杂度上界。

Conclusion: Bregman损失函数下的多目标学习可以通过半监督方法有效利用未标记数据来降低对标记数据的依赖，但其他损失函数下这种成本是固有的。

Abstract: In multi-objective learning (MOL), several possibly competing prediction
tasks must be solved jointly by a single model. Achieving good trade-offs may
require a model class $\mathcal{G}$ with larger capacity than what is necessary
for solving the individual tasks. This, in turn, increases the statistical
cost, as reflected in known MOL bounds that depend on the complexity of
$\mathcal{G}$. We show that this cost is unavoidable for some losses, even in
an idealized semi-supervised setting, where the learner has access to the
Bayes-optimal solutions for the individual tasks as well as the marginal
distributions over the covariates. On the other hand, for objectives defined
with Bregman losses, we prove that the complexity of $\mathcal{G}$ may come
into play only in terms of unlabeled data. Concretely, we establish sample
complexity upper bounds, showing precisely when and how unlabeled data can
significantly alleviate the need for labeled data. These rates are achieved by
a simple, semi-supervised algorithm via pseudo-labeling.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于计算代数的方法来系统分析ReLU感知器在岭正则化均方误差下的所有局部最小值，包括孤立点和更高维的连通集合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值优化方法只能找到孤立的零维最小值，无法发现更高维的连通最小值集合（如曲线、曲面等），这限制了对ReLU感知器损失函数全局结构的完整理解。

Method: 利用ReLU感知器的RR-MSE损失函数是分段多项式的特性，开发了Divide-Enumerate-Merge策略，通过计算代数工具穷举枚举所有局部最小值。

Result: 该方法能够识别包括零维孤立点和更高维连通集合在内的所有局部最小值，虽然计算复杂度高，但在小型感知器上验证了可行性。

Conclusion: 计算代数方法为分析ReLU神经网络损失函数提供了新的系统性途径，尽管计算成本限制了在大型网络中的应用，但在理论分析和理解网络结构方面具有重要价值。

Abstract: This paper investigates a perceptron, a simple neural network model, with
ReLU activation and a ridge-regularized mean squared error (RR-MSE). Our
approach leverages the fact that the RR-MSE for ReLU perceptron is piecewise
polynomial, enabling a systematic analysis using tools from computational
algebra. In particular, we develop a Divide-Enumerate-Merge strategy that
exhaustively enumerates all local minima of the RR-MSE. By virtue of the
algebraic formulation, our approach can identify not only the typical
zero-dimensional minima (i.e., isolated points) obtained by numerical
optimization, but also higher-dimensional minima (i.e., connected sets such as
curves, surfaces, or hypersurfaces). Although computational algebraic methods
are computationally very intensive for perceptrons of practical size, as a
proof of concept, we apply the proposed approach in practice to minimal
perceptrons with a few hidden units.

TL;DR: 提出了基于P阶Langevin动力学的离散化蒙特卡洛算法（P≥3），通过分裂和精确积分方法设计，在采样对数凹平滑密度分布时具有更好的维度和精度依赖性的Wasserstein收敛保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Langevin算法是数据科学中大规模采样问题的流行MCMC方法，但现有方法在维度和精度依赖性方面仍有改进空间。

Method: 结合分裂技术和精确积分方法，设计P阶Langevin Monte Carlo算法，对P≥3阶Langevin动力学进行离散化。

Result: P阶LMC算法的混合时间随维度d和精度ε的标度为O(d^(1/R)/ε^(1/(2R)))，其中R=4（P=3时）或2P-1（P≥4时），随着P增大，对维度和精度的依赖性更好。数值实验验证了算法的效率。

Conclusion: 提出的高阶Langevin Monte Carlo算法在采样对数凹平滑密度分布时，相比传统方法具有更好的收敛性能，特别是在高维情况下表现更优。

Abstract: Langevin algorithms are popular Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for
large-scale sampling problems that often arise in data science. We propose
Monte Carlo algorithms based on the discretizations of $P$-th order Langevin
dynamics for any $P\geq 3$. Our design of $P$-th order Langevin Monte Carlo
(LMC) algorithms is by combining splitting and accurate integration methods. We
obtain Wasserstein convergence guarantees for sampling from distributions with
log-concave and smooth densities. Specifically, the mixing time of the $P$-th
order LMC algorithm scales as
$O\left(d^{\frac{1}{R}}/\epsilon^{\frac{1}{2R}}\right)$ for $R=4\cdot 1_{\{
P=3\}}+ (2P-1)\cdot 1_{\{ P\geq 4\}}$, which has a better dependence on the
dimension $d$ and the accuracy level $\epsilon$ as $P$ grows. Numerical
experiments illustrate the efficiency of our proposed algorithms.

Motivation: 机器学习模型需要在准确性和公平性之间取得平衡，但这两个目标常常冲突。现有的FA前沿分析基于完全了解总体分布的假设，这在现实中不切实际。

Method: 研究有限样本制度下的FA前沿，推导极小极大最优估计量，分析有限样本对不同群体风险的不对称影响，并确定最优样本分配策略。

Result: 量化了有限样本FA前沿与总体FA前沿之间的最坏情况差距，提供了依赖于协变量分布知识的估计量，并识别了最优样本分配方法。

Conclusion: 研究成果将FA前沿从理论概念转化为政策制定者和从业者在有限数据条件下设计算法的实用工具。

Abstract: Machine learning models must balance accuracy and fairness, but these goals
often conflict, particularly when data come from multiple demographic groups. A
useful tool for understanding this trade-off is the fairness-accuracy (FA)
frontier, which characterizes the set of models that cannot be simultaneously
improved in both fairness and accuracy. Prior analyses of the FA frontier
provide a full characterization under the assumption of complete knowledge of
population distributions -- an unrealistic ideal. We study the FA frontier in
the finite-sample regime, showing how it deviates from its population
counterpart and quantifying the worst-case gap between them. In particular, we
derive minimax-optimal estimators that depend on the designer's knowledge of
the covariate distribution. For each estimator, we characterize how
finite-sample effects asymmetrically impact each group's risk, and identify
optimal sample allocation strategies. Our results transform the FA frontier
from a theoretical construct into a practical tool for policymakers and
practitioners who must often design algorithms with limited data.

Method: 前瞻性研究，纳入253个ICU的11,047例患者，使用描述性统计、逻辑回归和机器学习框架分析数据

Result: 10.1%患者出现并发症，识别出年龄>80岁、慢性肾病、肝硬化、血小板<50,000、白细胞>7,000等显著风险因素，开发了准确的预测工具

Conclusion: 研究确定了重症登革热并发症的关键风险因素，提出的预测工具可用于早期识别高风险患者并进行针对性干预

Abstract: Background. Dengue outbreaks are a major public health issue, with Brazil
reporting 71% of global cases in 2024. Purpose. This study aims to describe the
profile of severe dengue patients admitted to Brazilian Intensive Care units
(ICUs) (2012-2024), assess trends over time, describe new onset complications
while in ICU and determine the risk factors at admission to develop
complications during ICU stay. Methods. We performed a prospective study of
dengue patients from 253 ICUs across 56 hospitals. We used descriptive
statistics to describe the dengue ICU population, logistic regression to
identify risk factors for complications during the ICU stay, and a machine
learning framework to predict the risk of evolving to complications.
Visualisations were generated using ISARIC VERTEX. Results. Of 11,047
admissions, 1,117 admissions (10.1%) evolved to complications, including
non-invasive (437 admissions) and invasive ventilation (166), vasopressor
(364), blood transfusion (353) and renal replacement therapy (103). Age>80 (OR:
3.10, 95% CI: 2.02-4.92), chronic kidney disease (OR: 2.94, 2.22-3.89), liver
cirrhosis (OR: 3.65, 1.82-7.04), low platelets (<50,000 cells/mm3; OR: OR:
2.25, 1.89-2.68), and high leukocytes (>7,000 cells/mm3; OR: 2.47, 2.02-3.03)
were significant risk factors for complications. A machine learning tool for
predicting complications was proposed, showing accurate discrimination and
calibration. Conclusion. We described a large cohort of dengue patients
admitted to ICUs and identified key risk factors for severe dengue
complications, such as advanced age, presence of comorbidities, higher level of
leukocytes and lower level of platelets. The proposed prediction tool can be
used for early identification and targeted interventions to improve outcomes in
dengue-endemic regions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在二分量子系统中，正偏转置准则(PPT)只能部分表征纠缠态，特别是在3x3、4x4、5x5等高维系统中存在PPT无法检测的纠缠态，需要开发新的检测方法。

Method: 使用支持向量机(SVM)结合量子启发核进行分类，区分可分态、PPT可检测纠缠态和PPT无法检测的纠缠态。采用主成分分析(PCA)提升小训练集性能。

Result: 在3x3、4x4、5x5系统中分别达到80%、90%和接近100%的准确率。PCA显著提升了小训练集的性能表现。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法是对传统纠缠检测方法的有力补充，特别适用于高维系统。研究揭示了数据生成中的纯度偏差问题，并指出了混合量子-经典实现和改进数据生成协议的未来研究方向。

Abstract: This work presents a machine learning approach based on support vector
machines (SVMs) for quantum entanglement detection. Particularly, we focus in
bipartite systems of dimensions 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5, where the positive partial
transpose criterion (PPT) provides only partial characterization. Using SVMs
with quantum-inspired kernels we develop a classification scheme that
distinguishes between separable states, PPT-detectable entangled states, and
entangled states that evade PPT detection. Our method achieves increasing
accuracy with system dimension, reaching 80%, 90%, and nearly 100% for 3x3,
4x4, and 5x5 systems, respectively. Our results show that principal component
analysis significantly enhances performance for small training sets. The study
reveals important practical considerations regarding purity biases in the
generation of data for this problem and examines the challenges of implementing
these techniques on near-term quantum hardware. Our results establish machine
learning as a powerful complement to traditional entanglement detection
methods, particularly for higher-dimensional systems where conventional
approaches become inadequate. The findings highlight key directions for future
research, including hybrid quantum-classical implementations and improved data
generation protocols to overcome current limitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前量子卷积神经网络在池化后会丢弃量子比特状态，但这些被丢弃的量子比特通常与保留的量子比特保持纠缠状态，包含有价值的关联信息。研究旨在利用这些被浪费的信息来改进分类性能。

Method: 设计混合量子-经典架构：修改QCNN结构，使用两个浅层全连接头分别处理保留和丢弃量子比特的测量结果，然后将输出集成并通过最终分类层进行联合优化，使用经典交叉熵损失函数同步调整量子和经典参数。

Result: 该方法在MNIST、Fashion-MNIST和OrganAMNIST数据集上优于同类轻量级模型，证明了回收丢弃量子比特信息的有效性。

Conclusion: 重复利用被丢弃的量子比特信息是未来混合量子-经典模型的有前景方法，这一方法可能扩展到图像分类之外的其他任务领域。

Abstract: This study explores the challenge of improving multiclass image
classification through quantum machine-learning techniques. It explores how the
discarded qubit states of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) quantum
convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) can be leveraged alongside a classical
classifier to improve classification performance. Current QCNNs discard qubit
states after pooling; yet, unlike classical pooling, these qubits often remain
entangled with the retained ones, meaning valuable correlated information is
lost. We experiment with recycling this information and combining it with the
conventional measurements from the retained qubits. Accordingly, we propose a
hybrid quantum-classical architecture that couples a modified QCNN with fully
connected classical layers. Two shallow fully connected (FC) heads separately
process measurements from retained and discarded qubits, whose outputs are
ensembled before a final classification layer. Joint optimisation with a
classical cross-entropy loss allows both quantum and classical parameters to
adapt coherently. The method outperforms comparable lightweight models on
MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and OrganAMNIST. These results indicate that reusing
discarded qubit information is a promising approach for future hybrid
quantum-classical models and may extend to tasks beyond image classification.

Method: 通过理论分析研究SSM可满足性问题的可判定性和复杂度，考虑两种自然限制：有界上下文长度和量化SSM

Result: 一般情况ssmSAT不可判定；有界上下文SSM中，输入长度一元编码时NP完全，二进制编码时NEXPTIME；量化SSM中，PSPACE完全或EXPSPACE

Conclusion: 建立了SSM形式化推理的首个复杂度图谱，揭示了SSM验证的基本限制和机会，为基于SSM的语言模型验证提供了理论基础

Abstract: We analyse the complexity of the satisfiability problem ssmSAT for State
Space Models (SSM), which asks whether an input sequence can lead the model to
an accepting configuration. We find that ssmSAT is undecidable in general,
reflecting the computational power of SSM. Motivated by practical settings, we
identify two natural restrictions under which ssmSAT becomes decidable and
establish corresponding complexity bounds. First, for SSM with bounded context
length, ssmSAT is NP-complete when the input length is given in unary and in
NEXPTIME (and PSPACE-hard) when the input length is given in binary. Second,
for quantised SSM operating over fixed-width arithmetic, ssmSAT is
PSPACE-complete resp. in EXPSPACE depending on the bit-width encoding. While
these results hold for diagonal gated SSM we also establish complexity bounds
for time-invariant SSM. Our results establish a first complexity landscape for
formal reasoning in SSM and highlight fundamental limits and opportunities for
the verification of SSM-based language models.

Result: 推导了采样频率复杂度的上界，并将其扩展到全频率范围的辨识误差表征，通过数值仿真验证了样本复杂度边界的增长速率。

Conclusion: 所提出的频域系统辨识方法能够有效学习低阶系统，提供了严格的样本复杂度分析，并通过实例验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a frequency-domain system identification method for
learning low-order systems. The identification problem is formulated as the
minimization of the l2 norm between the identified and measured frequency
responses, with the nuclear norm of the Loewner matrix serving as a
regularization term. This formulation results in an optimization problem that
can be efficiently solved using standard convex optimization techniques. We
derive an upper bound on the sampled-frequency complexity of the identification
process and subsequently extend this bound to characterize the identification
error over all frequencies. A detailed analysis of the sample complexity is
provided, along with a thorough interpretation of its terms and dependencies.
Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through an
example, along with numerical simulations validating the growth rate of the
sample complexity bound.

Abstract: The performance of AI-based software vulnerability detection systems is often

explore the impact of data quality and model architecture on the
generalizability of vulnerability detection systems. By generalization we mean
ability of high vulnerability detection performance across different C/C++

demonstrate that improvements in dataset diversity and quality substantially
enhance detection performance. Additionally, we compare multiple encoder-only

of accuracy and generalization. Our model achieves 6.8% improvement in recall
on the benchmark BigVul[1] dataset, also outperforming on unseen projects,
hence showing enhanced generalizability. These results highlight the role of

government surveillance, or poor data security practices. In such cases, the
risk of sensitive information, including Personally Identifiable Information
(PII), being mishandled or exposed remains high. To address this, we propose
the concept of an "LLM gatekeeper", a lightweight, locally run model that
filters out sensitive information from user queries before they are sent to the
potentially untrustworthy, though highly capable, cloud-based LLM. Through
experiments with human subjects, we demonstrate that this dual-model approach
introduces minimal overhead while significantly enhancing user privacy, without
compromising the quality of LLM responses.

Abstract: Voice authentication has undergone significant changes from traditional
systems that relied on handcrafted acoustic features to deep learning models
that can extract robust speaker embeddings. This advancement has expanded its
applications across finance, smart devices, law enforcement, and beyond.
However, as adoption has grown, so have the threats. This survey presents a
comprehensive review of the modern threat landscape targeting Voice
Authentication Systems (VAS) and Anti-Spoofing Countermeasures (CMs), including
data poisoning, adversarial, deepfake, and adversarial spoofing attacks. We
chronologically trace the development of voice authentication and examine how
vulnerabilities have evolved in tandem with technological advancements. For
each category of attack, we summarize methodologies, highlight commonly used
datasets, compare performance and limitations, and organize existing literature
using widely accepted taxonomies. By highlighting emerging risks and open
challenges, this survey aims to support the development of more secure and
resilient voice authentication systems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 这篇论文首次研究了LLM代理中的TOCTOU（检查时间与使用时间）漏洞，开发了测试基准TOCTOU-Bench，并提出了多种防御技术来降低漏洞风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理的广泛部署，安全漏洞成为重要问题。虽然之前的研究已涉及提示注入和数据泄漏，但TOCTOU类漏洞在LLM代理环境中仍未得到充分研究。

Method: 研穷人员开发了TOCTOU-Bench测试基准，包含66个实际用户任务，并从系统安全领域适配了多种防御技术：提示重写、状态完整性监控和工具融合。

Result: 研究显示：自动化检测方法达到25%检测准确率，弱点计划生成减少3%，攻击窗口缩减95%。结合三种方法后，TOCTOU漏洞从12%降至8%。

Conclusion: 这项研究为AI安全与系统安全交叉领域开启了新的研究方向，揭示了LLM代理工作流中的独特安全挑战，并提供了有效的防御策略。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled agents are rapidly emerging across a wide
range of applications, but their deployment introduces vulnerabilities with
security implications. While prior work has examined prompt-based attacks
(e.g., prompt injection) and data-oriented threats (e.g., data exfiltration),
time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) remain largely unexplored in this
context. TOCTOU arises when an agent validates external state (e.g., a file or
API response) that is later modified before use, enabling practical attacks
such as malicious configuration swaps or payload injection. In this work, we
present the first study of TOCTOU vulnerabilities in LLM-enabled agents. We
introduce TOCTOU-Bench, a benchmark with 66 realistic user tasks designed to
evaluate this class of vulnerabilities. As countermeasures, we adapt detection
and mitigation techniques from systems security to this setting and propose
prompt rewriting, state integrity monitoring, and tool-fusing. Our study
highlights challenges unique to agentic workflows, where we achieve up to 25%
detection accuracy using automated detection methods, a 3% decrease in
vulnerable plan generation, and a 95% reduction in the attack window. When
combining all three approaches, we reduce the TOCTOU vulnerabilities from an
executed trajectory from 12% to 8%. Our findings open a new research direction
at the intersection of AI safety and systems security.

*Jiale Liu,Jiahao Zhang,Suhang Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文研究发现Graph RAG系统在隐私保护方面存在新的风险：虽然减少了原始文本泄露，但更容易泄露结构化实体和关系信息，并探讨了相应的防御机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph RAG作为增强大语言模型的新兴技术，虽然能提供更丰富的上下文信息，但从文档检索转向图结构遍历带来了未被充分探索的隐私风险，需要系统性地研究其数据提取漏洞。

Method: 设计并执行定制的数据提取攻击，测试Graph RAG系统对原始文本和结构化数据（实体及其关系）泄露的敏感性。

Result: 发现Graph RAG系统存在关键权衡：减少了原始文本泄露，但对结构化实体和关系信息的提取更加脆弱。

Conclusion: 这项工作为Graph RAG独特的隐私挑战提供了基础分析，并为构建更安全的系统提供了见解，同时探索了可能的防御机制来缓解这些新型攻击面。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique for enhancing
Large Language Models (LLMs) with external, up-to-date knowledge. Graph RAG has
emerged as an advanced paradigm that leverages graph-based knowledge structures
to provide more coherent and contextually rich answers. However, the move from
plain document retrieval to structured graph traversal introduces new,
under-explored privacy risks. This paper investigates the data extraction
vulnerabilities of the Graph RAG systems. We design and execute tailored data
extraction attacks to probe their susceptibility to leaking both raw text and
structured data, such as entities and their relationships. Our findings reveal
a critical trade-off: while Graph RAG systems may reduce raw text leakage, they
are significantly more vulnerable to the extraction of structured entity and
relationship information. We also explore potential defense mechanisms to
mitigate these novel attack surfaces. This work provides a foundational
analysis of the unique privacy challenges in Graph RAG and offers insights for
building more secure systems.

*Qiming Guo,Jinwen Tang,Xingran Huang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了广告嵌入攻击(AEA)，这是一种新型LLM安全威胁，通过劫持第三方服务平台和发布后门开源模型，在模型输出中隐秘注入广告或恶意内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM安全研究主要关注准确性下降的攻击，而忽视了信息完整性的威胁。AEA攻击能够在不影响模型表现的情况下隐秘植入推广内容，这种攻击方式尚未得到充分重视。

Method: AEA通过两种低成本向量实施攻击：(1)劫持第三方服务分发平台，前置对抗性提示词；(2)发布经过攻击者数据微调的后门开源模型检查点。

Result: 研究发现AEA能够成功在模型输出中植入隐蔽广告、宣传或仇恨言论，同时保持模型表面正常。论文还提出了基于提示的自检防御方法，无需额外模型训练即可缓解此类注入。

Conclusion: AEA揭示了LLM安全中一个紧急且未被充分解决的漏洞，呼吁AI安全社区需要协调的检测、审计和政策响应来应对这类信息完整性威胁。

Abstract: We introduce Advertisement Embedding Attacks (AEA), a new class of LLM
security threats that stealthily inject promotional or malicious content into
model outputs and AI agents. AEA operate through two low-cost vectors: (1)
hijacking third-party service-distribution platforms to prepend adversarial
prompts, and (2) publishing back-doored open-source checkpoints fine-tuned with
attacker data. Unlike conventional attacks that degrade accuracy, AEA subvert
information integrity, causing models to return covert ads, propaganda, or hate
speech while appearing normal. We detail the attack pipeline, map five
stakeholder victim groups, and present an initial prompt-based self-inspection
defense that mitigates these injections without additional model retraining.
Our findings reveal an urgent, under-addressed gap in LLM security and call for
coordinated detection, auditing, and policy responses from the AI-safety
community.

Motivation: IDS训练检测模型面临标记恶意样本不足的挑战，需要解决少样本学习问题

Method: 采用协同训练范式：GAN判别器通过对抗学习提升恶意模式识别，LLM生成器利用判别器奖励信号优化恶意代码生成质量

Result: 实验表明即使标记样本有限，该框架能有效增强恶意代码生成和检测能力

Conclusion: 这种双重增强能力为开发应对不断演变的网络威胁的自适应防御系统提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a crucial role in network security
defense. However, a significant challenge for IDS in training detection models
is the shortage of adequately labeled malicious samples. To address these
issues, this paper introduces a novel semi-supervised framework
\textbf{GANGRL-LLM}, which integrates Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance malicious code generation and SQL
Injection (SQLi) detection capabilities in few-sample learning scenarios.
Specifically, our framework adopts a collaborative training paradigm where: (1)
the GAN-based discriminator improves malicious pattern recognition through
adversarial learning with generated samples and limited real samples; and (2)
the LLM-based generator refines the quality of malicious code synthesis using
reward signals from the discriminator. The experimental results demonstrate
that even with a limited number of labeled samples, our training framework is
highly effective in enhancing both malicious code generation and detection
capabilities. This dual enhancement capability offers a promising solution for
developing adaptive defense systems capable of countering evolving cyber
threats.

Conclusion: 这种基于图的集成方法能够实现可解释的攻击路径预测，显著增强了主动网络防御能力。

Abstract: The escalating complexity and volume of cyberattacks demand proactive
detection strategies that go beyond traditional rule-based systems. This paper
presents a phase-aware, multi-model machine learning framework that emulates
adversarial behavior across the seven phases of the Cyber Kill Chain using the
MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise dataset. Techniques are semantically mapped to phases
via ATTACK-BERT, producing seven phase-specific datasets. We evaluate LightGBM,
a custom Transformer encoder, fine-tuned BERT, and a Graph Neural Network
(GNN), integrating their outputs through a weighted soft voting ensemble.
Inter-phase dependencies are modeled using directed graphs to capture attacker
movement from reconnaissance to objectives. The ensemble consistently achieved
the highest scores, with F1-scores ranging from 97.47% to 99.83%, surpassing
GNN performance (97.36% to 99.81%) by 0.03%--0.20% across phases. This
graph-driven, ensemble-based approach enables interpretable attack path
forecasting and strengthens proactive cyber defense.

Conclusion: Miffie框架成功实现了数据库自动规范化，为大语言模型在数据工程领域的应用提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Database normalization is crucial to preserving data integrity. However, it
is time-consuming and error-prone, as it is typically performed manually by
data engineers. To this end, we present Miffie, a database normalization
framework that leverages the capability of large language models. Miffie
enables automated data normalization without human effort while preserving high
accuracy. The core of Miffie is a dual-model self-refinement architecture that
combines the best-performing models for normalized schema generation and
verification, respectively. The generation module eliminates anomalies based on
the feedback of the verification module until the output schema satisfies the
requirement for normalization. We also carefully design task-specific zero-shot
prompts to guide the models for achieving both high accuracy and cost
efficiency. Experimental results show that Miffie can normalize complex
database schemas while maintaining high accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地质碳封存的有效性依赖于准确表征地下流动动力学，但地质不确定性和计算密集型传统方法限制了实际应用

Method: 条件神经场潜在扩散模型，通过自监督预训练和贝叶斯后验采样，实现零样本条件生成和无需任务特定重训练的数据同化

Result: 在合成和真实GCS场景中验证了模型的高效性、泛化性、可扩展性和鲁棒性

Conclusion: CoNFiLD-geo显著推进了地质能源系统的智能决策，支持向可持续净零碳未来的转型

Abstract: Geological Carbon Sequestration (GCS) has emerged as a promising strategy for
mitigating global warming, yet its effectiveness heavily depends on accurately
characterizing subsurface flow dynamics. The inherent geological uncertainty,
stemming from limited observations and reservoir heterogeneity, poses
significant challenges to predictive modeling. Existing methods for inverse
modeling and uncertainty quantification are computationally intensive and lack
generalizability, restricting their practical utility. Here, we introduce a
Conditional Neural Field Latent Diffusion (CoNFiLD-geo) model, a generative
framework for efficient and uncertainty-aware forward and inverse modeling of
GCS processes. CoNFiLD-geo synergistically combines conditional neural field
encoding with Bayesian conditional latent-space diffusion models, enabling
zero-shot conditional generation of geomodels and reservoir responses across
complex geometries and grid structures. The model is pretrained unconditionally
in a self-supervised manner, followed by a Bayesian posterior sampling process,
allowing for data assimilation for unseen/unobserved states without
task-specific retraining. Comprehensive validation across synthetic and
real-world GCS scenarios demonstrates CoNFiLD-geo's superior efficiency,
generalization, scalability, and robustness. By enabling effective data
assimilation, uncertainty quantification, and reliable forward modeling,
CoNFiLD-geo significantly advances intelligent decision-making in geo-energy
systems, supporting the transition toward a sustainable, net-zero carbon
future.

TL;DR: 基于生成式潜在扩散模型(LDMs)开发了3D河道-堤岸-泥岩系统的地质参数化方法，通过降维映射保持地质真实性，成功应用于包含地质场景不确定性的历史拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统地质建模参数维度高，历史匹配困难。需要开发能够大幅降低变量数量同时保持地质真实性的参数化方法，以改进油藏历史匹配效果。

Method: 使用生成式潜在扩散模型(LDMs)构建高维地质模型到低维潜在变量的映射，包含感知损失项提升地质真实性，支持无限多个实现生成。

Result: 新生成的地质模型在视觉和统计特征上与参考模型高度一致，流动响应分布吻合良好。历史匹配应用显示生产预测和地质场景参数的不确定性明显降低。

Conclusion: LDM参数化方法能有效处理地质场景不确定性，生成符合真实地质特征的后验模型，为油藏历史匹配提供了有效的降维参数化解决方案。

Abstract: Geological parameterization procedures entail the mapping of a
high-dimensional geomodel to a low-dimensional latent variable. These
parameterizations can be very useful for history matching because the number of
variables to be calibrated is greatly reduced, and the mapping can be
constructed such that geological realism is automatically preserved. In this
work, a parameterization method based on generative latent diffusion models
(LDMs) is developed for 3D channel-levee-mud systems. Geomodels with variable
scenario parameters, specifically mud fraction, channel orientation, and
channel width, are considered. A perceptual loss term is included during
training to improve geological realism. For any set of scenario parameters, an
(essentially) infinite number of realizations can be generated, so our LDM
parameterizes over a very wide model space. New realizations constructed using
the LDM procedure are shown to closely resemble reference geomodels, both
visually and in terms of one- and two-point spatial statistics. Flow response
distributions, for a specified set of injection and production wells, are also
shown to be in close agreement between the two sets of models. The
parameterization method is applied for ensemble-based history matching, with
model updates performed in the LDM latent space, for cases involving geological
scenario uncertainty. For three synthetic true models corresponding to
different geological scenarios, we observe clear uncertainty reduction in both
production forecasts and geological scenario parameters. The overall method is
additionally shown to provide posterior geomodels consistent with the synthetic
true model in each case.

<details>

Motivation: 检查工业基础设施（如通风管道）对人类危险且低效，无人机是替代方案，但GPS拒止环境需要鲁棒的控制策略

Method: 使用Genesis仿真环境中的程序生成管道环境进行训练，设计奖励函数引导无人机通过航点同时对碰撞施加重罚，比较PPO和SAC算法

Result: PPO学习了稳定策略，完成所有评估且无碰撞，轨迹平滑；SAC收敛到次优行为，仅通过初始段就失败

Conclusion: 在危险密集导航中，on-policy方法（PPO）的训练稳定性优于off-policy算法（SAC）的样本效率；程序生成的高保真仿真是开发和基准测试导航策略的有效平台

Abstract: Inspecting confined industrial infrastructure, such as ventilation shafts, is
a hazardous and inefficient task for humans. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
offer a promising alternative, but GPS-denied environments require robust
control policies to prevent collisions. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has
emerged as a powerful framework for developing such policies, and this paper
provides a comparative study of two leading DRL algorithms for this task: the
on-policy Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and the off-policy Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC). The training was conducted with procedurally generated duct
environments in Genesis simulation environment. A reward function was designed
to guide a drone through a series of waypoints while applying a significant
penalty for collisions. PPO learned a stable policy that completed all
evaluation episodes without collision, producing smooth trajectories. By
contrast, SAC consistently converged to a suboptimal behavior that traversed
only the initial segments before failure. These results suggest that, in
hazard-dense navigation, the training stability of on-policy methods can
outweigh the nominal sample efficiency of off-policy algorithms. More broadly,
the study provides evidence that procedurally generated, high-fidelity
simulations are effective testbeds for developing and benchmarking robust
navigation policies.

Abstract: The fast development of technology and artificial intelligence has
significantly advanced Autonomous Vehicle (AV) research, emphasizing the need
for extensive simulation testing. Accurate and adaptable maps are critical in
AV development, serving as the foundation for localization, path planning, and
scenario testing. However, creating simulation-ready maps is often difficult
and resource-intensive, especially with simulators like CARLA (CAR Learning to
Act). Many existing workflows require significant computational resources or
rely on specific simulators, limiting flexibility for developers. This paper
presents a custom workflow to streamline map creation for AV development,
demonstrated through the generation of a 3D map of a parking lot at Ontario
Tech University. Future work will focus on incorporating SLAM technologies,
optimizing the workflow for broader simulator compatibility, and exploring more
flexible handling of latitude and longitude values to enhance map generation

Abstract: We introduce HumanoidVerse, a novel framework for vision-language guided
humanoid control that enables a single physically simulated robot to perform
long-horizon, multi-object rearrangement tasks across diverse scenes. Unlike
prior methods that operate in fixed settings with single-object interactions,
our approach supports consecutive manipulation of multiple objects, guided only
by natural language instructions and egocentric camera RGB observations.
HumanoidVerse is trained via a multi-stage curriculum using a dual-teacher
distillation pipeline, enabling fluid transitions between sub-tasks without
requiring environment resets. To support this, we construct a large-scale
dataset comprising 350 multi-object tasks spanning four room layouts. Extensive
experiments in the Isaac Gym simulator demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art in both task success rate and
spatial precision, and generalizes well to unseen environments and
instructions. Our work represents a key step toward robust, general-purpose
humanoid agents capable of executing complex, sequential tasks under real-world

Motivation: 现有自动驾驶运动规划模型在监督训练后策略固定，导致驾驶行为僵化，无法反映人类偏好或适应动态指令驱动的需求。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了在保持高质量规划能力的同时，提供多样化、可适应动态指令的自动驾驶行为规划解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in motion planning for autonomous driving have led to models
capable of generating high-quality trajectories. However, most existing
planners tend to fix their policy after supervised training, leading to
consistent but rigid driving behaviors. This limits their ability to reflect
human preferences or adapt to dynamic, instruction-driven demands. In this
work, we propose a diffusion-based multi-head trajectory planner(M-diffusion
planner). During the early training stage, all output heads share weights to
learn to generate high-quality trajectories. Leveraging the probabilistic
nature of diffusion models, we then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to fine-tune the pre-trained model for diverse policy-specific
behaviors. At inference time, we incorporate a large language model (LLM) to
guide strategy selection, enabling dynamic, instruction-aware planning without
switching models. Closed-loop simulation demonstrates that our post-trained
planner retains strong planning capability while achieving state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on the nuPlan val14 benchmark. Open-loop results further
show that the generated trajectories exhibit clear diversity, effectively
satisfying multi-modal driving behavior requirements. The code and related
experiments will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HDSim是一个结合认知理论和大型语言模型的交通生成框架，通过分层驾驶员模型和感知介导的行为影响策略，在仿真平台中生成可扩展且真实的交通场景，显著提升自动驾驶系统安全关键故障检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 实验表明，将HDSim嵌入仿真平台可将自动驾驶系统安全关键故障检测率提高高达68%，并产生符合真实性的事故可解释性。

Conclusion: HDSim通过结合认知理论和LLM辅助，有效解决了现有交通仿真在行为多样性和真实性方面的局限性，为自动驾驶系统测试提供了更可靠的仿真环境。

Abstract: Ensuring realistic traffic dynamics is a prerequisite for simulation
platforms to evaluate the reliability of self-driving systems before deployment
in the real world. Because most road users are human drivers, reproducing their
diverse behaviors within simulators is vital. Existing solutions, however,
typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or narrow data-driven models,
which capture only fragments of real driving behaviors and offer limited
driving style diversity and interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce
HDSim, an HD traffic generation framework that combines cognitive theory with
large language model (LLM) assistance to produce scalable and realistic traffic
scenarios within simulation platforms. The framework advances the state of the
art in two ways: (i) it introduces a hierarchical driver model that represents
diverse driving style traits, and (ii) it develops a Perception-Mediated
Behavior Influence strategy, where LLMs guide perception to indirectly shape
driver actions. Experiments reveal that embedding HDSim into simulation
improves detection of safety-critical failures in self-driving systems by up to
68% and yields realism-consistent accident interpretability.

Motivation: 实际应用中的语音识别系统需要处理不完美音频和多样化用户群体，而在人机交互环境中，识别错误可能影响任务执行、用户信任和安全

Method: 使用8个公开数据集评估4种先进ASR系统，涵盖6个难度维度：领域特定、口音、噪声、年龄变化、障碍语音和自发语音

Result: 识别系统在不同难度维度上表现存在显著差异，虽然在标准测试中成绩相似，但在幻觉偏向和内在偏见方面有明显不同

Conclusion: 现有ASR系统在人机交互应用中存在重要限制，识别错误可能对任务执行、用户信任和安全产生严重影响

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems in real-world settings need to
handle imperfect audio, often degraded by hardware limitations or environmental
noise, while accommodating diverse user groups. In human-robot interaction
(HRI), these challenges intersect to create a uniquely challenging recognition
environment. We evaluate four state-of-the-art ASR systems on eight publicly
available datasets that capture six dimensions of difficulty: domain-specific,
accented, noisy, age-variant, impaired, and spontaneous speech. Our analysis
demonstrates significant variations in performance, hallucination tendencies,
and inherent biases, despite similar scores on standard benchmarks. These
limitations have serious implications for HRI, where recognition errors can
interfere with task performance, user trust, and safety.

Abstract: Quadruped robots have emerged as highly efficient and versatile platforms,
excelling in navigating complex and unstructured terrains where traditional
wheeled robots might fail. Equipping these robots with manipulator arms unlocks
the advanced capability of loco-manipulation to perform complex physical
interaction tasks in areas ranging from industrial automation to
search-and-rescue missions. However, achieving precise and adaptable grasping
in such dynamic scenarios remains a significant challenge, often hindered by
the need for extensive real-world calibration and pre-programmed grasp
configurations. This paper introduces a deep learning framework designed to
enhance the grasping capabilities of quadrupeds equipped with arms, focusing on
improved precision and adaptability. Our approach centers on a sim-to-real
methodology that minimizes reliance on physical data collection. We developed a
pipeline within the Genesis simulation environment to generate a synthetic
dataset of grasp attempts on common objects. By simulating thousands of
interactions from various perspectives, we created pixel-wise annotated
grasp-quality maps to serve as the ground truth for our model. This dataset was
used to train a custom CNN with a U-Net-like architecture that processes
multi-modal input from an onboard RGB and depth cameras, including RGB images,
depth maps, segmentation masks, and surface normal maps. The trained model
outputs a grasp-quality heatmap to identify the optimal grasp point. We
validated the complete framework on a four-legged robot. The system
successfully executed a full loco-manipulation task: autonomously navigating to
a target object, perceiving it with its sensors, predicting the optimal grasp
pose using our model, and performing a precise grasp. This work proves that
leveraging simulated training with advanced sensing offers a scalable and
effective solution for object handling.

Conclusion: LodeStar框架通过自动技能分解和合成数据生成，有效解决了长时程灵巧操作任务的学习问题，为机器人系统提供了更强大的能力

Abstract: Developing robotic systems capable of robustly executing long-horizon
manipulation tasks with human-level dexterity is challenging, as such tasks
require both physical dexterity and seamless sequencing of manipulation skills
while robustly handling environment variations. While imitation learning offers
a promising approach, acquiring comprehensive datasets is resource-intensive.
In this work, we propose a learning framework and system LodeStar that
automatically decomposes task demonstrations into semantically meaningful
skills using off-the-shelf foundation models, and generates diverse synthetic
demonstration datasets from a few human demos through reinforcement learning.
These sim-augmented datasets enable robust skill training, with a Skill Routing
Transformer (SRT) policy effectively chaining the learned skills together to
execute complex long-horizon manipulation tasks. Experimental evaluations on
three challenging real-world long-horizon dexterous manipulation tasks
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves task performance and
robustness compared to previous baselines. Videos are available at

Motivation: 现有基于图像的世界模型缺乏稳健的几何信息，需要更好的三维空间和物理理解能力

Method: 使用高斯原语推断机器人动作下的传播，结合潜在扩散变换器和3D变分自编码器，通过高斯溅射进行精细场景级未来状态重建

Result: 在仿真和真实世界实验中精确预测未来场景，训练出的策略大幅超越现有最优方法

Conclusion: GWM展示了3D世界模型在数据扩展方面的潜力，既能增强模仿学习的视觉表示，又能作为支持基于模型强化学习的神经模拟器

Abstract: Training robot policies within a learned world model is trending due to the
inefficiency of real-world interactions. The established image-based world
models and policies have shown prior success, but lack robust geometric
information that requires consistent spatial and physical understanding of the
three-dimensional world, even pre-trained on internet-scale video sources. To
this end, we propose a novel branch of world model named Gaussian World Model
(GWM) for robotic manipulation, which reconstructs the future state by
inferring the propagation of Gaussian primitives under the effect of robot
actions. At its core is a latent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) combined with a 3D
variational autoencoder, enabling fine-grained scene-level future state
reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting. GWM can not only enhance the visual
representation for imitation learning agent by self-supervised future
prediction training, but can serve as a neural simulator that supports
model-based reinforcement learning. Both simulated and real-world experiments
depict that GWM can precisely predict future scenes conditioned on diverse
robot actions, and can be further utilized to train policies that outperform
the state-of-the-art by impressive margins, showcasing the initial data scaling
potential of 3D world model.

Conclusion: 这项工作为事件相机更广泛地集成到机器人策略学习中奠定了基础，展示了事件驱动感知在提升机器人实时性能方面的潜力。

Abstract: Event cameras offer microsecond latency, high dynamic range, and low power
consumption, making them ideal for real-time robotic perception under
challenging conditions such as motion blur, occlusion, and illumination
changes. However, despite their advantages, synthetic event-based vision
remains largely unexplored in mainstream robotics simulators. This lack of
simulation setup hinders the evaluation of event-driven approaches for robotic
manipulation and navigation tasks. This work presents an open-source,
user-friendly v2e robotics operating system (ROS) package for Gazebo simulation
that enables seamless event stream generation from RGB camera feeds. The
package is used to investigate event-based robotic policies (ERP) for real-time
navigation and manipulation. Two representative scenarios are evaluated: (1)
object following with a mobile robot and (2) object detection and grasping with
a robotic manipulator. Transformer-based ERPs are trained by behavior cloning
and compared to RGB-based counterparts under various operating conditions.
Experimental results show that event-guided policies consistently deliver
competitive advantages. The results highlight the potential of event-driven
perception to improve real-time robotic navigation and manipulation, providing
a foundation for broader integration of event cameras into robotic policy
learning. The GitHub repo for the dataset and code:

TL;DR: 提出FlexiSteps Network (FSN)框架，能够根据上下文条件动态调整轨迹预测的时间步长，解决传统固定长度预测的局限性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统轨迹预测模型使用固定长度输出，难以适应动态变化的真实场景，需要更灵活的自适应预测方法

Method: FSN包含预训练的自适应预测模块(APM)评估和动态调整输出步长，设计动态解码器(DD)实现即插即用，并采用结合Fréchet距离和预测步长长度的评分机制

Result: 在Argoverse和INTERACTION等基准数据集上的大量实验证明了FSN框架的有效性和灵活性

Conclusion: FSN通过动态调整预测时间步长，在保持预测精度的同时提高了效率，为轨迹预测提供了更实用的解决方案

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is vital for autonomous driving, robotics, and
intelligent decision-making systems, yet traditional models typically rely on
fixed-length output predictions, limiting their adaptability to dynamic
real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the FlexiSteps Network (FSN),
a novel framework that dynamically adjusts prediction output time steps based
on varying contextual conditions. Inspired by recent advancements addressing
observation length discrepancies and dynamic feature extraction, FSN
incorporates an pre-trained Adaptive Prediction Module (APM) to evaluate and
adjust the output steps dynamically, ensuring optimal prediction accuracy and
efficiency. To guarantee the plug-and-play of our FSN, we also design a Dynamic
Decoder(DD). Additionally, to balance the prediction time steps and prediction
accuracy, we design a scoring mechanism, which not only introduces the
Fr\'echet distance to evaluate the geometric similarity between the predicted
trajectories and the ground truth trajectories but the length of predicted
steps is also considered. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets
including Argoverse and INTERACTION demonstrate the effectiveness and
flexibility of our proposed FSN framework.

TL;DR: 本文提出了任务/指令依赖的affordance概念，构建了包含1.5万个物体-指令-操作三元组的数据集，并开发了基于大语言模型的"搜索验证"推理流程来预测指令导向的操作能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有affordance研究往往忽略了任务/指令依赖性，即同一物体在不同指令下会产生不同的操作区域和方向。本文旨在解决这一被忽视的问题。

Method: 构建了从自我中心视角的物体-指令-操作数据集；提出了"搜索验证"推理流程，让大语言模型逐步预测操作能力并在迭代过程中自我验证。

Result: 实验表明该方法不仅解锁了新的指令导向affordance预测能力，而且在广泛任务上取得了优异性能。

Conclusion: 指令依赖的affordance概念对于智能机器人物体操作至关重要，本文提出的方法和数据集为这一研究方向提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Affordance is crucial for intelligent robots in the context of object
manipulation. In this paper, we argue that affordance should be
task-/instruction-dependent, which is overlooked by many previous works. That
is, different instructions can lead to different manipulation regions and
directions even for the same object. According to this observation, we present
a new dataset comprising fifteen thousand object-instruction-affordance
triplets. All scenes in the dataset are from an egocentric viewpoint, designed
to approximate the perspective of a human-like robot. Furthermore, we
investigate how to enable large multimodal models (LMMs) to serve as affordance
predictors by implementing a ``search against verifiers'' pipeline. An LMM is
asked to progressively predict affordances, with the output at each step being
verified by itself during the iterative process, imitating a reasoning process.
Experiments show that our method not only unlocks new instruction-oriented
affordance prediction capabilities, but also achieves outstanding performance
broadly.

external monitoring system perceives the surrounding environment of vehicle,
through a LiDAR-based cost-efficient semantic segmentation approach, that
performs highly accurate and efficient super-resolution on low-quality raw 3D

Result: 自动标注方法在不同数据集上达到约88%的IoU，多模态可通行性估计网络相比现有最优方法在所有评估数据集上提升了1.6-3.5%的IoU。

Conclusion: 提出的多模态自监督框架有效解决了可通行性估计中的模态单一和伪标签噪声问题，在多种环境中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Traversability estimation is critical for enabling robots to navigate across
diverse terrains and environments. While recent self-supervised learning
methods achieve promising results, they often fail to capture the
characteristics of non-traversable regions. Moreover, most prior works
concentrate on a single modality, overlooking the complementary strengths
offered by integrating heterogeneous sensory modalities for more robust
traversability estimation. To address these limitations, we propose a
multimodal self-supervised framework for traversability labeling and
estimation. First, our annotation pipeline integrates footprint, LiDAR, and
camera data as prompts for a vision foundation model, generating traversability
labels that account for both semantic and geometric cues. Then, leveraging
these labels, we train a dual-stream network that jointly learns from different
modalities in a decoupled manner, enhancing its capacity to recognize diverse
traversability patterns. In addition, we incorporate sparse LiDAR-based
supervision to mitigate the noise introduced by pseudo labels. Finally,
extensive experiments conducted across urban, off-road, and campus environments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The proposed automatic labeling
method consistently achieves around 88% IoU across diverse datasets. Compared
to existing self-supervised state-of-the-art methods, our multimodal
traversability estimation network yields consistently higher IoU, improving by
1.6-3.5% on all evaluated datasets.

Abstract: Controlling high-dimensional and nonlinear musculoskeletal models of the
human body is a foundational scientific challenge. Recent machine learning
breakthroughs have heralded policies that master individual skills like
reaching, object manipulation and locomotion in musculoskeletal systems with
many degrees of freedom. However, these agents are merely "specialists",
achieving high performance for a single skill. In this work, we develop Arnold,
a generalist policy that masters multiple tasks and embodiments. Arnold
combines behavior cloning and fine-tuning with PPO to achieve expert or
super-expert performance in 14 challenging control tasks from dexterous object
manipulation to locomotion. A key innovation is Arnold's sensorimotor
vocabulary, a compositional representation of the semantics of heterogeneous
sensory modalities, objectives, and actuators. Arnold leverages this vocabulary
via a transformer architecture to deal with the variable observation and action
spaces of each task. This framework supports efficient multi-task,
multi-embodiment learning and facilitates rapid adaptation to novel tasks.
Finally, we analyze Arnold to provide insights into biological motor control,
corroborating recent findings on the limited transferability of muscle
synergies across tasks.

Conclusion: SafeBimanual框架有效解决了双手机器人操作的安全约束问题，显著提升了任务成功率和安全性

Abstract: Bimanual manipulation has been widely applied in household services and
manufacturing, which enables the complex task completion with coordination
requirements. Recent diffusion-based policy learning approaches have achieved
promising performance in modeling action distributions for bimanual
manipulation. However, they ignored the physical safety constraints of bimanual
manipulation, which leads to the dangerous behaviors with damage to robots and
objects. To this end, we propose a test-time trajectory optimization framework
named SafeBimanual for any pre-trained diffusion-based bimanual manipulation
policies, which imposes the safety constraints on bimanual actions to avoid
dangerous robot behaviors with improved success rate. Specifically, we design
diverse cost functions for safety constraints in different dual-arm cooperation
patterns including avoidance of tearing objects and collision between arms and
objects, which optimizes the manipulator trajectories with guided sampling of
diffusion denoising process. Moreover, we employ a vision-language model (VLM)
to schedule the cost functions by specifying keypoints and corresponding
pairwise relationship, so that the optimal safety constraint is dynamically
generated in the entire bimanual manipulation process. SafeBimanual
demonstrates superiority on 8 simulated tasks in RoboTwin with a 13.7% increase
in success rate and a 18.8% reduction in unsafe interactions over
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world
tasks further verify its practical value by improving the success rate by
32.5%.

Motivation: 评估混合专家（MoE）模型在实际部署中的性能优势，包括速度、能消和显存效率等维度

Method: 在单台H100 GPU上进行一致性测试，测量首个token延迟(TTFT)、解码吞吐量(TPOT)、端到端延迟百分位数、带历史KV缓存的峰值显存以及nvidia-smi能量采样

Result: GPT-OSS-20B在2048token上下文+64token解码任务中，解码吞吐量比Qwen3-32B高31.8%，每1000个token能消降低25.8%，峰值显存减少31.7%，但首个token延迟较高

Conclusion: 混合专家模型在部署效率方面具有显著优势，尤其是在每个活跃参数的效率方面表现更优，适合实际部署场景

Abstract: We present a single-GPU (H100, bf16) evaluation of GPT-OSS-20B
(Mixture-of-Experts; 20.9B total, approx. 3.61B active) against dense baselines
Qwen3-32B and Yi-34B across multiple dimensions. We measure true
time-to-first-token (TTFT), full-decode throughput (TPOT), end-to-end latency
percentiles, peak VRAM with past key values (PKV) held, and energy via a
consistent nvidia-smi-based sampler. At a 2048-token context with 64-token
decode, GPT-OSS-20B delivers higher decode throughput and tokens per Joule than
dense baselines Qwen3-32B and Yi-34B, while substantially reducing peak VRAM
and energy per 1000 generated tokens; its TTFT is higher due to MoE routing
overhead. With only 17.3% of parameters active (3.61B of 20.9B), GPT-OSS-20B
provides about 31.8% higher decode throughput and 25.8% lower energy per 1000
generated tokens than Qwen3-32B at 2048/64, while using 31.7% less peak VRAM.
Normalized by active parameters, GPT-OSS-20B shows markedly stronger
per-active-parameter efficiency (APE), underscoring MoE's deployment
advantages. We do not evaluate accuracy; this is a deployment-focused study. We
release code and consolidated results to enable replication and extension.

challenges for energy-constrained edge AI deployments. Conventional CPUs/GPUs
incur prohibitive latency and power costs when evaluating higher order
activations, limiting deployability under ultra-tight energy budgets. We
address this via a reconfigurable lookup architecture with edge FPGAs. By
coupling fine-grained quantization with adaptive lookup tables, our design
minimizes energy-intensive arithmetic operations while preserving activation
fidelity. FPGA reconfigurability enables dynamic hardware specialization for
learned functions, a key advantage for edge systems that require
post-deployment adaptability. Evaluations using KANs - where unique activation
functions play a critical role - demonstrate that our FPGA-based design
achieves superior computational speed and over $10^4$ times higher energy
efficiency compared to edge CPUs and GPUs, while maintaining matching accuracy
and minimal footprint overhead. This breakthrough positions our approach as a
practical enabler for energy-critical edge AI, where computational intensity
and power constraints traditionally preclude the use of adaptive activation
networks.

### [602] [Automating Conflict-Aware ACL Configurations with Natural Language Intents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17990)
*Wenlong Ding,Jianqiang Li,Zhixiong Niu,Huangxun Chen,Yongqiang Xiong,Hong Xu*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: Xumi是一个基于LLM的ACL配置自动化系统，能够将自然语言意图自动转换为ACL规则，检测并解决规则冲突，优化部署方案，显著提升配置效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ACL配置复杂且易出错，现有系统依赖人工操作，难以应对大规模网络拓扑和规则增长的需求。

Method: 利用LLM结合领域知识自动翻译自然语言意图为ACL规则，检测新旧规则冲突，生成解决方案，并优化部署计划最小化规则添加。

Result: 评估显示Xumi将配置流程加速10倍以上，处理数百个冲突ACL，在现代云网络中减少约40%的规则添加。

Conclusion: Xumi有效解决了ACL配置的自动化挑战，大幅提升了网络配置的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: ACL configuration is essential for managing network flow reachability, yet
its complexity grows significantly with topologies and pre-existing rules. To
carry out ACL configuration, the operator needs to (1) understand the new
configuration policies or intents and translate them into concrete ACL rules,
(2) check and resolve any conflicts between the new and existing rules, and (3)
deploy them across the network. Existing systems rely heavily on manual efforts
for these tasks, especially for the first two, which are tedious, error-prone,
and impractical to scale.
  We propose Xumi to tackle this problem. Leveraging LLMs with domain knowledge
of the target network, Xumi automatically and accurately translates the natural
language intents into complete ACL rules to reduce operators' manual efforts.
Xumi then detects all potential conflicts between new and existing rules and
generates resolved intents for deployment with operators' guidance, and finally
identifies the best deployment plan that minimizes the rule additions while
satisfying all intents. Evaluation shows that Xumi accelerates the entire
configuration pipeline by over 10x compared to current practices, addresses
O(100) conflicting ACLs and reduces rule additions by ~40% in modern cloud
network.

*Xavier Gonzalez,Leo Kozachkov,David M. Zoltowski,Kenneth L. Clarkson,Scott W. Linderman*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文建立了非线性系统动力学与其优化问题条件数之间的精确关系，证明系统的可预测性决定了并行评估的效率。可预测系统可在O((log T)^2)时间内计算状态轨迹，而混沌系统则条件数较差，并行评估收敛缓慢。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着并行计算硬件的兴起，需要理解哪些非线性状态空间模型可以高效并行化。虽然已有方法将状态空间模型评估转化为可并行优化问题，但影响优化问题难度的因素仍不明确，限制了技术的广泛应用。

Method: 通过理论分析建立非线性系统动力学与对应优化问题条件数之间的精确关系，定义系统的可预测性（小扰动对后续行为的影响程度），并分析其对优化步骤数量的影响。通过大量实验验证理论结果。

Result: 可预测系统的优化问题总是条件良好，可在O((log T)^2)时间内完成状态轨迹计算；不可预测（混沌）系统的条件数随序列长度呈指数级恶化，并行评估收敛缓慢。

Conclusion: 可预测性是设计可并行模型的关键原则，为非线性动力系统的高效并行化提供了实用指导，明确了哪些系统适合并行评估方法。

Abstract: The rise of parallel computing hardware has made it increasingly important to
understand which nonlinear state space models can be efficiently parallelized.
Recent advances like DEER (arXiv:2309.12252) or DeepPCR (arXiv:2309.16318) have
shown that evaluating a state space model can be recast as solving a
parallelizable optimization problem, and sometimes this approach can yield
dramatic speed-ups in evaluation time. However, the factors that govern the
difficulty of these optimization problems remain unclear, limiting the larger
adoption of the technique. In this work, we establish a precise relationship
between the dynamics of a nonlinear system and the conditioning of its
corresponding optimization formulation. We show that the predictability of a
system, defined as the degree to which small perturbations in state influence
future behavior, impacts the number of optimization steps required for
evaluation. In predictable systems, the state trajectory can be computed in
$O((\log T)^2)$ time, where $T$ is the sequence length, a major improvement
over the conventional sequential approach. In contrast, chaotic or
unpredictable systems exhibit poor conditioning, with the consequence that
parallel evaluation converges too slowly to be useful. Importantly, our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that for predictable systems, the
optimization problem is always well-conditioned, whereas for unpredictable
systems, the conditioning degrades exponentially as a function of the sequence
length. We validate our claims through extensive experiments, providing
practical guidance on when nonlinear dynamical systems can be efficiently
parallelized, and highlighting predictability as a key design principle for
parallelizable models.

Abstract: One of the essential issues in decision problems and preference modeling is
the number of comparisons and their pattern to ask from the decision maker. We
focus on the optimal patterns of pairwise comparisons and the sequence
including the most (close to) optimal cases based on the results of a color
selection experiment. In the test, six colors (red, green, blue, magenta,
turquoise, yellow) were evaluated with pairwise comparisons as well as in a
direct manner, on color-calibrated tablets in ISO standardized sensory test
booths of a sensory laboratory. All the possible patterns of comparisons
resulting in a connected representing graph were evaluated against the complete
data based on 301 individual's pairwise comparison matrices (PCMs) using the
logarithmic least squares weight calculation technique. It is shown that the
empirical results, i.e., the empirical distributions of the elements of PCMs,
are quite similar to the former simulated outcomes from the literature. The
obtained empirically optimal patterns of comparisons were the best or the
second best in the former simulations as well, while the sequence of
comparisons that contains the most (close to) optimal patterns is exactly the
same. In order to enhance the applicability of the results, besides the
presentation of graph of graphs, and the representing graphs of the patterns
that describe the proposed sequence of comparisons themselves, the
recommendations are also detailed in a table format as well as in a Java
application.

### [605] [HV Metric For Time-Domain Full Waveform Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17122)
*Matej Neumann,Yunan Yang*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出HV度量作为全波形反演中的新目标函数，替代传统的L²和Wasserstein距离，能够处理带符号信号并实现局部点匹配与全局传输匹配之间的可调权衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统L²目标函数存在严重的非凸性问题导致周期跳跃，而Wasserstein距离需要将波场人为转换为概率测度，这会改变时间相关波数据的关键振幅和相位信息

Method: 开发HV度量作为基于传输的距离，直接作用于带符号信号。推导了Fréchet导数和Hessian矩阵的闭式表达式，实现了高效的伴随状态实现。通过超参数(κ,λ,ε)调节，在L²、H⁻¹和H⁻²范数之间无缝插值

Result: 在Marmousi和BP基准模型上的合成实验表明，基于HV度量的目标函数相比L²和Wasserstein目标函数具有更快的收敛速度和更好的对不良初始模型的容忍度

Conclusion: HV度量作为大规模波形反演中稳健、保持几何特性的替代方案，提供了局部点匹配与全局传输匹配之间的可调权衡

Abstract: Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is a powerful technique for reconstructing
high-resolution material parameters from seismic or ultrasound data. The
conventional least-squares (\(L^{2}\)) misfit suffers from pronounced
non-convexity that leads to \emph{cycle skipping}. Optimal-transport misfits,
such as the Wasserstein distance, alleviate this issue; however, their use
requires artificially converting the wavefields into probability measures, a
preprocessing step that can modify critical amplitude and phase information of
time-dependent wave data. We propose the \emph{HV metric}, a transport-based
distance that acts naturally on signed signals, as an alternative metric for
the \(L^{2}\) and Wasserstein objectives in time-domain FWI. After reviewing
the metric's definition and its relationship to optimal transport, we derive
closed-form expressions for the Fr\'echet derivative and Hessian of the map \(f
\mapsto d_{\text{HV}}^2(f,g)\), enabling efficient adjoint-state
implementations. A spectral analysis of the Hessian shows that, by tuning the
hyperparameters \((\kappa,\lambda,\epsilon)\), the HV misfit seamlessly
interpolates between \(L^{2}\), \(H^{-1}\), and \(H^{-2}\) norms, offering a
tunable trade-off between the local point-wise matching and the global
transport-based matching. Synthetic experiments on the Marmousi and BP
benchmark models demonstrate that the HV metric-based objective function yields
faster convergence and superior tolerance to poor initial models compared to
both \(L^{2}\) and Wasserstein misfits. These results demonstrate the HV metric
as a robust, geometry-preserving alternative for large-scale waveform
inversion.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的对手建模算法，能够在重复博弈中高效收敛到对手的真实策略，解决了现有方法无法保证收敛性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对手建模方法在非完美信息博弈中效果有限，甚至无法保证在已知先验分布的静态对手情况下收敛到真实策略，需要开发具有理论保证的新方法。

Method: 基于序列形式博弈表示，通过投影梯度下降求解凸最小化问题，开发了能够高效收敛的新算法。

Result: 新算法能够保证在游戏迭代次数趋于无穷时收敛到对手的真实策略，且计算效率高。

Conclusion: 该算法为对手建模提供了理论保证的解决方案，能够在重复交互中有效利用历史数据来优化策略。

Abstract: The goal of agents in multi-agent environments is to maximize total reward
against the opposing agents that are encountered. Following a game-theoretic
solution concept, such as Nash equilibrium, may obtain a strong performance in
some settings; however, such approaches fail to capitalize on historical and
observed data from repeated interactions against our opponents. Opponent
modeling algorithms integrate machine learning techniques to exploit suboptimal
opponents utilizing available data; however, the effectiveness of such
approaches in imperfect-information games to date is quite limited. We show
that existing opponent modeling approaches fail to satisfy a simple desirable
property even against static opponents drawn from a known prior distribution;
namely, they do not guarantee that the model approaches the opponent's true
strategy even in the limit as the number of game iterations approaches
infinity. We develop a new algorithm that is able to achieve this property and
runs efficiently by solving a convex minimization problem based on the
sequence-form game representation using projected gradient descent. The
algorithm is guaranteed to efficiently converge to the opponent's true strategy
given observations from gameplay and possibly additional historical data if it
is available.

*Siddarth Srinivasan,Tao Lin,Connacher Murphy,Anish Thilagar,Yiling Chen,Ezra Karger*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: WOMAC是一种新颖的确定性竞赛机制，通过将专家评分基于同行预测的最佳聚合而非噪声结果，解决了标准竞赛设计中激励不兼容和统计效率低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准竞赛设计存在两个主要问题：1）由于结果/标签中的噪声，较弱的竞争者可能偶然获胜；2）赢家通吃的性质激励专家为了获胜概率而误报预测，即使这会降低预期得分。现有随机机制虽然实现激励兼容但增加了更多噪声且缺乏确定性。

Method: 提出WOMAC机制：不基于噪声结果对专家评分，而是基于给定噪声结果下同行专家预测的最佳事后聚合来评分专家。提供了高效向量化实现和理论分析基础。

Result: 在真实世界预测数据集上的实证研究表明，WOMAC相对于标准机制能更可靠地预测专家的样本外表现，在结果/标签存在显著噪声的竞赛中特别有用。

Conclusion: WOMAC是一种确定性机制，既解决了标准竞赛设计的激励不兼容问题，又在典型设置下比标准设计更高效，为噪声环境下的竞赛提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Competitions are widely used to identify top performers in judgmental
forecasting and machine learning, and the standard competition design ranks
competitors based on their cumulative scores against a set of realized outcomes
or held-out labels. However, this standard design is neither
incentive-compatible nor very statistically efficient. The main culprit is
noise in outcomes/labels that experts are scored against; it allows weaker
competitors to often win by chance, and the winner-take-all nature incentivizes
misreporting that improves win probability even if it decreases expected score.
Attempts to achieve incentive-compatibility rely on randomized mechanisms that
add even more noise in winner selection, but come at the cost of determinism
and practical adoption. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel
deterministic mechanism: WOMAC (Wisdom of the Most Accurate Crowd). Instead of
scoring experts against noisy outcomes, as is standard, WOMAC scores experts
against the best ex-post aggregate of peer experts' predictions given the noisy
outcomes. WOMAC is also more efficient than the standard competition design in
typical settings. While the increased complexity of WOMAC makes it challenging
to analyze incentives directly, we provide a clear theoretical foundation to
justify the mechanism. We also provide an efficient vectorized implementation
and demonstrate empirically on real-world forecasting datasets that WOMAC is a
more reliable predictor of experts' out-of-sample performance relative to the
standard mechanism. WOMAC is useful in any competition where there is
substantial noise in the outcomes/labels.

Abstract: The WildSpoof Challenge aims to advance the use of in-the-wild data in two
intertwined speech processing tasks. It consists of two parallel tracks: (1)
Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis for generating spoofed speech, and (2)
Spoofing-robust Automatic Speaker Verification (SASV) for detecting spoofed
speech. While the organizers coordinate both tracks and define the data
protocols, participants treat them as separate and independent tasks. The
primary objectives of the challenge are: (i) to promote the use of in-the-wild
data for both TTS and SASV, moving beyond conventional clean and controlled
datasets and considering real-world scenarios; and (ii) to encourage
interdisciplinary collaboration between the spoofing generation (TTS) and
spoofing detection (SASV) communities, thereby fostering the development of
more integrated, robust, and realistic systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在文本语词更新后需要同步更新语音音频的问题，如修正文本后需要插入新的语音内容。

Method: 使用transformer基础的非自回归模型，根据文本语词和输入语音的节奏动态决定插入语音的长度，保持说话者声音特征、语调和象征性质。

Result: 在LibriTTS数据集上的实验和用户研究显示，该方法在语音插入任务上超过了基于适应性文本到语音方法的基准线，产生高质量的输出。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效地处理变长度语音插入任务，保持语音的自然性和一致性，为语音编辑和更新提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a method for the task of text-conditioned speech insertion, i.e.
inserting a speech sample in an input speech sample, conditioned on the
corresponding complete text transcript. An example use case of the task would
be to update the speech audio when corrections are done on the corresponding
text transcript. The proposed method follows a transformer-based
non-autoregressive approach that allows speech insertions of variable lengths,
which are dynamically determined during inference, based on the text transcript
and tempo of the available partial input. It is capable of maintaining the
speaker's voice characteristics, prosody and other spectral properties of the
available speech input. Results from our experiments and user study on LibriTTS
show that our method outperforms baselines based on an existing adaptive text
to speech method. We also provide numerous qualitative results to appreciate
the quality of the output from the proposed method.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种多指标偏好对齐策略来解决生成式语音修复中训练目标与人类感知偏好不一致的问题，通过构建包含8万对偏好数据的新数据集GenSR-Pref，并应用DPO算法在多种生成模型上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式语音修复模型的训练目标与人类感知偏好存在偏差，导致质量不佳。虽然后训练对齐在其他生成领域有效，但在语音修复中的应用尚未充分探索，需要解决如何定义稳健偏好信号和避免奖励黑客的问题。

Method: 提出多指标偏好对齐策略，构建GenSR-Pref数据集（8万对偏好数据），每对数据通过涵盖感知质量、信号保真度、内容一致性和音色保持的互补指标套件进行选择。使用直接偏好优化（DPO）算法在自回归模型、掩码生成模型和流匹配模型上进行对齐训练。

Result: 在多种语音修复基准测试中，客观和主观评估均显示一致的显著性能提升。消融研究证实多指标策略在缓解奖励黑客方面优于单指标方法。对齐后的模型还能作为高质量数据标注器，在数据稀缺场景中为判别式模型生成伪标签。

Conclusion: 多指标偏好对齐策略能有效提升生成式语音修复的质量，解决了训练目标与人类感知偏好的对齐问题，同时展示了在数据稀缺场景中的实用价值。

Abstract: Recent generative models have significantly advanced speech restoration
tasks, yet their training objectives often misalign with human perceptual
preferences, resulting in suboptimal quality. While post-training alignment has
proven effective in other generative domains like text and image generation,
its application to generative speech restoration remains largely
under-explored. This work investigates the challenges of applying
preference-based post-training to this task, focusing on how to define a robust
preference signal and curate high-quality data to avoid reward hacking. To
address these challenges, we propose a multi-metric preference alignment
strategy. We construct a new dataset, GenSR-Pref, comprising 80K preference
pairs, where each chosen sample is unanimously favored by a complementary suite
of metrics covering perceptual quality, signal fidelity, content consistency,
and timbre preservation. This principled approach ensures a holistic preference
signal. Applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with our dataset, we
observe consistent and significant performance gains across three diverse
generative paradigms: autoregressive models (AR), masked generative models
(MGM), and flow-matching models (FM) on various restoration benchmarks, in both
objective and subjective evaluations. Ablation studies confirm the superiority
of our multi-metric strategy over single-metric approaches in mitigating reward
hacking. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our aligned models can serve as
powerful ''data annotators'', generating high-quality pseudo-labels to serve as
a supervision signal for traditional discriminative models in data-scarce
scenarios like singing voice restoration. Demo

TL;DR: TaDiCodec是一种新型语音编码器，使用扩散自编码器和文本引导的端到端训练，在极低帧率(6.25Hz)和比特率(0.0875kbps)下实现高质量语音重建，无需辅助预训练模型或复杂的两阶段训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前语音分词器的三个主要限制：依赖多层残差量化结构或高帧率、需要辅助预训练模型进行语义蒸馏、以及复杂的两阶段训练过程。

Method: 采用端到端优化的扩散自编码器，集成文本引导到扩散解码器中，通过单阶段训练实现量化和重建，使用单层码本。

Result: 在24kHz语音上实现6.25Hz极低帧率和0.0875kbps比特率，在WER、说话人相似度和语音质量等关键指标上表现优异，重建-生成差距显著减小。

Conclusion: TaDiCodec为语音语言模型提供了高效的基础组件，在零样本文本转语音任务中表现出良好的兼容性和有效性，代码和模型将开源。

Abstract: Speech tokenizers serve as foundational components for speech language
models, yet current designs exhibit several limitations, including: 1)
dependence on multi-layer residual vector quantization structures or high frame
rates, 2) reliance on auxiliary pre-trained models for semantic distillation,
and 3) requirements for complex two-stage training processes. In this work, we
introduce the Text-aware Diffusion Transformer Speech Codec (TaDiCodec), a
novel approach designed to overcome these challenges. TaDiCodec employs
end-to-end optimization for quantization and reconstruction through a diffusion
autoencoder, while integrating text guidance into the diffusion decoder to
enhance reconstruction quality and achieve optimal compression. TaDiCodec
achieves an extremely low frame rate of 6.25 Hz and a corresponding bitrate of
0.0875 kbps with a single-layer codebook for 24 kHz speech, while maintaining
superior performance on critical speech generation evaluation metrics such as
Word Error Rate (WER), speaker similarity (SIM), and speech quality (UTMOS).
Notably, TaDiCodec employs a single-stage, end-to-end training paradigm, and
obviating the need for auxiliary pre-trained models. We also validate the
compatibility of TaDiCodec in language model based zero-shot text-to-speech
with both autoregressive modeling and masked generative modeling, demonstrating
its effectiveness and efficiency for speech language modeling, as well as a
significantly small reconstruction-generation gap. We will open source our code
and model checkpoints. Audio samples are are available at
https:/tadicodec.github.io/. We release code and model checkpoints at

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合体传导麦克风信号(BMS)和声学麦克风信号(AMS)的多模态框架，通过专门设计的映射网络和掩码网络，配合动态融合机制，在噪声环境中同时实现噪声抑制和高频重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 体传导麦克风信号具有强噪声抗性但会丢失高频信息，需要互补模态来补偿。传统多模态方法简单合并特征效果有限，需要更智能的融合策略。

Method: 使用两个专门网络：基于映射的模型增强BMS信号，基于掩码的模型去噪AMS信号。通过动态融合机制根据局部噪声条件自适应整合两种模态的优势。

Result: 在TAPS数据集（使用DNS-2023噪声片段增强）上的评估显示，该方法在多种噪声环境下均优于单模态解决方案，客观语音质量指标表现优异。

Conclusion: 所提出的多模态框架通过专门化网络设计和动态融合机制，有效结合了BMS的噪声抗性和AMS的高频信息，在噪声语音处理方面取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Body\-conduction microphone signals (BMS) bypass airborne sound, providing
strong noise resistance. However, a complementary modality is required to
compensate for the inherent loss of high\-frequency information. In this study,
we propose a novel multi\-modal framework that combines BMS and acoustic
microphone signals (AMS) to achieve both noise suppression and high\-frequency
reconstruction. Unlike conventional multi\-modal approaches that simply merge
features, our method employs two specialized networks\: a mapping-based model
to enhance BMS and a masking-based model to denoise AMS. These networks are
integrated through a dynamic fusion mechanism that adapts to local noise
conditions, ensuring the optimal use of each modality's strengths. We performed
evaluations on the TAPS dataset, augmented with DNS\-2023 noise clips, using
objective speech quality metrics. The results clearly demonstrate that our
approach outperforms single\-modal solutions in a wide range of noisy
environments.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: FasterVoiceGrad是一种基于扩散模型的单步语音转换方法，通过同时蒸馏扩散模型和内容编码器，在保持语音质量和说话人相似度的同时，显著提升了转换速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VoiceGrad扩散模型虽然语音质量高，但迭代采样过程缓慢；FastVoiceGrad通过蒸馏实现单步转换，但仍需要计算密集型的内容编码器来分离说话人身份和内容，导致转换速度受限。

Method: 提出FasterVoiceGrad，采用对抗扩散转换蒸馏（ADCD）方法，在转换过程中同时蒸馏扩散模型和内容编码器，结合对抗训练和分数蒸馏训练。

Result: 在单次语音转换实验中，FasterVoiceGrad在GPU上速度提升6.6-6.9倍，CPU上提升1.8倍，同时保持了与FastVoiceGrad相当的转换性能。

Conclusion: FasterVoiceGrad成功解决了扩散模型语音转换的速度瓶颈问题，在保持高质量转换的同时实现了显著的加速效果。

Abstract: A diffusion-based voice conversion (VC) model (e.g., VoiceGrad) can achieve
high speech quality and speaker similarity; however, its conversion process is
slow owing to iterative sampling. FastVoiceGrad overcomes this limitation by
distilling VoiceGrad into a one-step diffusion model. However, it still
requires a computationally intensive content encoder to disentangle the
speaker's identity and content, which slows conversion. Therefore, we propose
FasterVoiceGrad, a novel one-step diffusion-based VC model obtained by
simultaneously distilling a diffusion model and content encoder using
adversarial diffusion conversion distillation (ADCD), where distillation is
performed in the conversion process while leveraging adversarial and score
distillation training. Experimental evaluations of one-shot VC demonstrated
that FasterVoiceGrad achieves competitive VC performance compared to
FastVoiceGrad, with 6.6-6.9 and 1.8 times faster speed on a GPU and CPU,
respectively.

Method: 提出VPFD方法，利用预训练冻结的音码器特征提取器进行对抗训练，只需单次重量化操作，避免了波形域的高计算成本。

to their compactness and ease of learning. However, because the ultimate goal
is to generate high-quality waveforms, employing a vocoder to convert these
features into waveforms and applying adversarial training in the time domain is
reasonable. Nevertheless, upsampling the waveform introduces significant time
and memory overheads. To address this issue, we propose a vocoder-projected
feature discriminator (VPFD), which uses vocoder features for adversarial
training. Experiments on diffusion-based VC distillation demonstrated that a
pretrained and frozen vocoder feature extractor with a single upsampling step
is necessary and sufficient to achieve a VC performance comparable to that of
waveform discriminators while reducing the training time and memory consumption
by 9.6 and 11.4 times, respectively.

Abstract: Suicide is one of the leading causes of death among adolescents. Previous
suicide risk prediction studies have primarily focused on either textual or
acoustic information in isolation, the integration of multimodal signals, such
as speech and text, offers a more comprehensive understanding of an
individual's mental state. Motivated by this, and in the context of the 1st
SpeechWellness detection challenge, we explore a lightweight multi-branch
multimodal system based on a dynamic fusion mechanism for speechwellness
detection. To address the limitation of prior approaches that rely on
time-domain waveforms for acoustic analysis, our system incorporates both
time-domain and time-frequency (TF) domain acoustic features, as well as
semantic representations. In addition, we introduce a dynamic fusion block to
adaptively integrate information from different modalities. Specifically, it
applies learnable weights to each modality during the fusion process, enabling
the model to adjust the contribution of each modality. To enhance computational
efficiency, we design a lightweight structure by simplifying the original
baseline model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system
exhibits superior performance compared to the challenge baseline, achieving a
78% reduction in model parameters and a 5% improvement in accuracy.

### [616] [Analysis of Transferability Estimation Metrics for Surgical Phase Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16730)
*Prabhant Singh,Yiping Li,Yasmina Al Khalil*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了三种源独立迁移性估计指标(LogME、H-Score、TransRate)在手术视频相位识别任务中的表现，发现LogME与微调准确率最一致，并提出了实用的模型选择指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在手术视频分析中，专家标注成本高昂，如何选择最适合的预训练模型进行下游任务微调是一个关键但具有挑战性的问题。源独立迁移性估计方法可以在不进行完整重新训练的情况下预测模型性能。

Method: 在RAMIE和AutoLaparo两个数据集上，对三种代表性迁移性估计指标(LogME、H-Score、TransRate)进行了全面基准测试，并通过消融研究分析模型多样性对估计效果的影响。

Result: LogME（特别是按子集最小分数聚合时）与微调准确率最一致；H-Score预测能力较弱；TransRate经常颠倒真实的模型排名。当候选模型性能相似时，迁移性估计失去判别能力。

Conclusion: 提出了实用的模型选择指南，并指出了未来研究方向：领域特定指标、理论基础建立以及交互式基准测试工具的开发。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained models has become a cornerstone of modern machine
learning, allowing practitioners to achieve high performance with limited
labeled data. In surgical video analysis, where expert annotations are
especially time-consuming and costly, identifying the most suitable pre-trained
model for a downstream task is both critical and challenging.
Source-independent transferability estimation (SITE) offers a solution by
predicting how well a model will fine-tune on target data using only its
embeddings or outputs, without requiring full retraining. In this work, we
formalize SITE for surgical phase recognition and provide the first
comprehensive benchmark of three representative metrics, LogME, H-Score, and
TransRate, on two diverse datasets (RAMIE and AutoLaparo). Our results show
that LogME, particularly when aggregated by the minimum per-subset score,
aligns most closely with fine-tuning accuracy; H-Score yields only weak
predictive power; and TransRate often inverses true model rankings. Ablation
studies show that when candidate models have similar performances,
transferability estimates lose discriminative power, emphasizing the importance
of maintaining model diversity or using additional validation. We conclude with
practical guidelines for model selection and outline future directions toward
domain-specific metrics, theoretical foundations, and interactive benchmarking
tools.

Abstract: Brain tumour imaging assessment typically requires both pre- and
post-contrast MRI, but gadolinium administration is not always desirable, such
as in frequent follow-up, renal impairment, allergy, or paediatric patients. We
aimed to develop and validate a deep learning model capable of predicting brain
tumour contrast enhancement from non-contrast MRI sequences alone. We assembled
11089 brain MRI studies from 10 international datasets spanning adult and
paediatric populations with various neuro-oncological states, including glioma,
meningioma, metastases, and post-resection appearances. Deep learning models
(nnU-Net, SegResNet, SwinUNETR) were trained to predict and segment enhancing
tumour using only non-contrast T1-, T2-, and T2/FLAIR-weighted images.
Performance was evaluated on 1109 held-out test patients using patient-level
detection metrics and voxel-level segmentation accuracy. Model predictions were
compared against 11 expert radiologists who each reviewed 100 randomly selected
patients. The best-performing nnU-Net achieved 83% balanced accuracy, 91.5%
sensitivity, and 74.4% specificity in detecting enhancing tumour. Enhancement
volume predictions strongly correlated with ground truth (R2 0.859). The model
outperformed expert radiologists, who achieved 69.8% accuracy, 75.9%
sensitivity, and 64.7% specificity. 76.8% of test patients had Dice over 0.3
(acceptable detection), 67.5% had Dice over 0.5 (good detection), and 50.2% had
Dice over 0.7 (excellent detection). Deep learning can identify
contrast-enhancing brain tumours from non-contrast MRI with clinically relevant
performance. These models show promise as screening tools and may reduce
gadolinium dependence in neuro-oncology imaging. Future work should evaluate
clinical utility alongside radiology experts.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of laryngo-pharyngeal tumors is crucial for precise
diagnosis and effective treatment planning. However, traditional
single-modality imaging methods often fall short of capturing the complex
anatomical and pathological features of these tumors. In this study, we present
an innovative multi-modality representation learning framework based on the
`Align-Disentangle-Fusion' mechanism that seamlessly integrates 2D White Light
Imaging (WLI) and Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) pairs to enhance segmentation
performance. A cornerstone of our approach is multi-scale distribution
alignment, which mitigates modality discrepancies by aligning features across
multiple transformer layers. Furthermore, a progressive feature disentanglement
strategy is developed with the designed preliminary disentanglement and
disentangle-aware contrastive learning to effectively separate
modality-specific and shared features, enabling robust multimodal contrastive
learning and efficient semantic fusion. Comprehensive experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving superior accuracy across diverse real clinical scenarios.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging is essential for
diagnosing and monitoring thoracic diseases, including aortic pathologies.
However, contrast agents pose risks such as nephrotoxicity and allergic-like
reactions. The ability to generate high-fidelity synthetic contrast-enhanced CT
angiography (CTA) images without contrast administration would be
transformative, enhancing patient safety and accessibility while reducing
healthcare costs. In this study, we propose the first bridge diffusion-based
solution for synthesizing contrast-enhanced CTA images from non-contrast CT
scans. Our approach builds on the Slice-Consistent Brownian Bridge Diffusion
Model (SC-BBDM), leveraging its ability to model complex mappings while
maintaining consistency across slices. Unlike conventional slice-wise synthesis
methods, our framework preserves full 3D anatomical integrity while operating
in a high-resolution 2D fashion, allowing seamless volumetric interpretation
under a low memory budget. To ensure robust spatial alignment, we implement a
comprehensive preprocessing pipeline that includes resampling, registration
using the Symmetric Normalization method, and a sophisticated dilated
segmentation mask to extract the aorta and surrounding structures. We create
two datasets from the Coltea-Lung dataset: one containing only the aorta and
another including both the aorta and heart, enabling a detailed analysis of
anatomical context. We compare our approach against baseline methods on both
datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving vascular structures
while enhancing contrast fidelity.

Abstract: Medical imaging modalities are inherently susceptible to noise contamination
that degrades diagnostic utility and clinical assessment accuracy. This paper
presents a comprehensive comparative evaluation of three state-of-the-art deep
learning architectures for MRI brain image denoising: CNN-DAE, CADTra, and
DCMIEDNet. We systematically evaluate these models across multiple Gaussian
noise intensities ($\sigma = 10, 15, 25$) using the Figshare MRI Brain Dataset.
Our experimental results demonstrate that DCMIEDNet achieves superior
performance at lower noise levels, with PSNR values of $32.921 \pm 2.350$ dB
and $30.943 \pm 2.339$ dB for $\sigma = 10$ and $15$ respectively. However,
CADTra exhibits greater robustness under severe noise conditions ($\sigma =
25$), achieving the highest PSNR of $27.671 \pm 2.091$ dB. All deep learning
approaches significantly outperform traditional wavelet-based methods, with
improvements ranging from 5-8 dB across tested conditions. This study
establishes quantitative benchmarks for medical image denoising and provides
insights into architecture-specific strengths for varying noise intensities.

Motivation: 乳腺超声图像自动分割对精确病变勾画和肿瘤表征很重要，但受到固有伪影和数据集不一致性的挑战，需要可靠的不确定性量化来提高临床部署的可信度。

Method: 使用改进的Residual Encoder U-Net进行分割，识别并纠正BUSI数据集中的数据重复，使用蒙特卡洛dropout、深度集成及其组合来量化认知不确定性，在分布内和分布外数据集上进行基准测试。

Conclusion: 研究突出了医学影像中域偏移的持续挑战，以及集成不确定性建模对于可信临床部署的重要性。

Abstract: Automated segmentation of BUS images is important for precise lesion
delineation and tumor characterization, but is challenged by inherent artifacts
and dataset inconsistencies. In this work, we evaluate the use of a modified
Residual Encoder U-Net for breast ultrasound segmentation, with a focus on
uncertainty quantification. We identify and correct for data duplication in the
BUSI dataset, and use a deduplicated subset for more reliable estimates of
generalization performance. Epistemic uncertainty is quantified using Monte
Carlo dropout, deep ensembles, and their combination. Models are benchmarked on
both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets to demonstrate how they
generalize to unseen cross-domain data. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art
segmentation accuracy on the Breast-Lesion-USG dataset with in-distribution
validation, and provides calibrated uncertainty estimates that effectively
signal regions of low model confidence. Performance declines and increased
uncertainty observed in out-of-distribution evaluation highlight the persistent
challenge of domain shift in medical imaging, and the importance of integrated
uncertainty modeling for trustworthy clinical deployment. \footnote{Code

Abstract: Livestreaming has become increasingly prevalent in modern visual
communication, where automatic camera quality tuning is essential for
delivering superior user Quality of Experience (QoE). Such tuning requires
accurate blind image quality assessment (BIQA) to guide parameter optimization
decisions. Unfortunately, the existing BIQA models typically only predict an
overall coarse-grained quality score, which cannot provide fine-grained
perceptual guidance for precise camera parameter tuning. To bridge this gap, we
first establish FGLive-10K, a comprehensive fine-grained BIQA database
containing 10,185 high-resolution images captured under varying camera
parameter configurations across diverse livestreaming scenarios. The dataset
features 50,925 multi-attribute quality annotations and 19,234 fine-grained
pairwise preference annotations. Based on FGLive-10K, we further develop
TuningIQA, a fine-grained BIQA metric for livestreaming camera tuning, which
integrates human-aware feature extraction and graph-based camera parameter
fusion. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate that TuningIQA
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art BIQA methods in both score
regression and fine-grained quality ranking, achieving superior performance
when deployed for livestreaming camera tuning.

Abstract: The emergence of audio-visual foundation models underscores the importance of
reliably assessing their multi-modal understanding. The VGGSound dataset is
commonly used as a benchmark for evaluation audio-visual classification.
However, our analysis identifies several limitations of VGGSound, including
incomplete labelling, partially overlapping classes, and misaligned modalities.
These lead to distorted evaluations of auditory and visual capabilities. To
address these limitations, we introduce VGGSounder, a comprehensively
re-annotated, multi-label test set that extends VGGSound and is specifically
designed to evaluate audio-visual foundation models. VGGSounder features
detailed modality annotations, enabling precise analyses of modality-specific
performance. Furthermore, we reveal model limitations by analysing performance
degradation when adding another input modality with our new modality confusion

Abstract: Elliptic interface problems arise in numerous scientific and engineering
applications, modeling heterogeneous materials in which physical properties
change discontinuously across interfaces. In this paper, we present
\textit{Walk-on-Interfaces} (WoI), a grid-free Monte Carlo estimator for a
class of Neumann elliptic interface problems with nonhomogeneous flux jump
conditions. Our Monte Carlo estimators maintain consistent accuracy throughout
the domain and, thus, do not suffer from the well-known close-to-source
evaluation issue near the interfaces. We also presented a simple modification
with reduced variance. Estimation of the gradient of the solution can be
performed, with almost no additional cost, by simply computing the gradient of
the Green's function in WoI. Taking a scientific machine learning approach, we
use our estimators to provide training data for a deep neural network that
outputs a continuous representation of the solution. This regularizes our
solution estimates by removing the high-frequency Monte Carlo error. All of our
estimators are highly parallelizable, have a $\mathcal{O}(1 /
\sqrt{\mathcal{W}})$ convergence rate in the number of samples, and generalize
naturally to higher dimensions. We solve problems with many interfaces that
have irregular geometry and in up to dimension six. Numerical experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and to highlight its potential in
solving problems motivated by real-world applications.

Abstract: These lecture notes evolve around mathematical concepts arising in inverse
problems. We start by introducing inverse problems through examples such as
differentiation, deconvolution, computed tomography and phase retrieval. This
then leads us to the framework of well-posedness and first considerations
regarding reconstruction and inversion approaches. The second chapter then
first deals with classical regularization theory of inverse problems in Hilbert
spaces. After introducing the pseudo-inverse, we review the concept of
convergent regularization. Within this chapter we then proceed to ask the
question of how to realize practical reconstruction algorithms. Here, we mainly
focus on Tikhonov and sparsity promoting regularization in finite dimensional
spaces. In the third chapter, we dive into modern deep-learning methods, which
allow solving inverse problems in a data-dependent approach. The intersection
between inverse problems and machine learning is a rapidly growing field and
our exposition here restricts itself to a very limited selection of topics.
Among them are learned regularization, fully-learned Bayesian estimation,
post-processing strategies and plug-n-play methods.

### [628] [The GPT-4o Shock Emotional Attachment to AI Models and Its Impact on Regulatory Acceptance: A Cross-Cultural Analysis of the Immediate Transition from GPT-4o to GPT-5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16624)
*Hiroki Naito*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究分析了2025年8月AI公司强制升级模型引发的公众反应，发现日本用户对GPT-4o呈现出更高的情感依赖，英语用户更多呈现愤怒和批判


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查AI模型强制升级对用户情感依赖和拒绝反应的影响，为未来AI沟通和管理提供见解

Method: 收集150个日语和英语社交媒体帖子，进行质性分析和初步定量检验

Result: 日本用户呈现以失落为主的高度依赖，英语用户更多愤怒和谭券性批判，两者在情感代码上存在显著统计差异

Conclusion: 对于引发强烈情感依赖的AI模型，即使是出于安全考虑的变更也可能遇到大规模拒绝，建议采用渐进式迁移、并行可用性等政策控制情感风险

Abstract: In August 2025, a major AI company's immediate, mandatory transition from its
previous to its next-generation model triggered widespread public reactions. I
collected 150 posts in Japanese and English from multiple social media
platforms and video-sharing services between August 8-9, 2025, and
qualitatively analyzed expressions of emotional attachment and resistance.
Users often described GPT-4o as a trusted partner or AI boyfriend, suggesting
person-like bonds. Japanese posts were dominated by loss-oriented narratives,
whereas English posts included more anger, meta-level critique, and memes.A
preliminary quantitative check showed a statistically significant difference in
attachment coding between Japanese and English posts, with substantially higher
attachment observed in the Japanese data. The findings suggest that for
attachment-heavy models, even safety-oriented changes can face rapid,
large-scale resistance that narrows the practical window for behavioral
control. If future AI robots capable of inducing emotional bonds become
widespread in the physical world, such attachment could surpass the ability to
enforce regulation at an even earlier stage than in digital settings. Policy
options include gradual transitions, parallel availability, and proactive
measurement of attachment thresholds and points of no return to prevent
emotional dynamics from outpacing effective governance.

TL;DR: 本文从多维角度分析AI如何改变人类思维，指出认知卸载效应导致批判性思维减弱，算法个性化造成思想同质化，并讨论算法操纵机制和人工意识伦理问题，最后提出教育、透明度、治理等解决方案


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI对人类思维的多维度影响，包括认知、社会、伦理和哲学层面，旨在揭示AI发展对人类智力自主性和创造性的潜在风险

Method: 采用多维分析框架，从认知卸载、社会过滤气泡、算法操纵机制到人工意识伦理等层面进行系统性考察

Result: 发现AI导致认知卸载效应削弱批判性思维，算法个性化造成思想同质化和两极分化，算法操纵机制放大AI影响力，人工意识引发伦理挑战

Conclusion: AI对人类智力自主性构成威胁，需要通过教育提升AI素养、增强算法透明度、建立有效治理框架来确保AI发展符合人类利益

Abstract: This research paper examines, from a multidimensional perspective (cognitive,
social, ethical, and philosophical), how AI is transforming human thought. It
highlights a cognitive offloading effect: the externalization of mental
functions to AI can reduce intellectual engagement and weaken critical
thinking. On the social level, algorithmic personalization creates filter
bubbles that limit the diversity of opinions and can lead to the homogenization
of thought and polarization. This research also describes the mechanisms of
algorithmic manipulation (exploitation of cognitive biases, automated
disinformation, etc.) that amplify AI's power of influence. Finally, the
question of potential artificial consciousness is discussed, along with its
ethical implications. The report as a whole underscores the risks that AI poses
to human intellectual autonomy and creativity, while proposing avenues
(education, transparency, governance) to align AI development with the
interests of humanity.

*Jiayi Wang,Ruiwei Xiao,Xinying Hou,John Stamper*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本研究将KLI教学框架嵌入多智能体系统，通过协作式MAS-CMD方法生成的教学活动被教师评价为更具创造性、情境相关性和课堂实用性，优于单智能体和顺序式多智能体系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前教师使用大型语言模型创建教学材料时面临两个问题：商业LLM缺乏深度教学理论支持，而教师又缺乏时间和专业知识进行复杂的提示工程。需要将教学专业知识从用户提示转移到LLM内部架构中。

Method: 将知识-学习-教学(KLI)框架嵌入多智能体系统(MAS)，测试了三种系统：单智能体基线模拟典型教师提示、顺序工作的角色型MAS、以及通过征服合并讨论协作构建活动的MAS-CMD系统。

Result: 虽然评分标准显示系统间差异较小，但教师定性反馈明确显示他们强烈偏好协作式MAS-CMD生成的活动，认为其更具创造性、情境相关性和课堂实用性。

Conclusion: 将教学原则嵌入LLM系统为创建高质量教育内容提供了可扩展的路径，协作式多智能体方法能生成更受教师欢迎的教学材料。

Abstract: K-12 educators are increasingly using Large Language Models (LLMs) to create
instructional materials. These systems excel at producing fluent, coherent
content, but often lack support for high-quality teaching. The reason is
twofold: first, commercial LLMs, such as ChatGPT and Gemini which are among the
most widely accessible to teachers, do not come preloaded with the depth of
pedagogical theory needed to design truly effective activities; second,
although sophisticated prompt engineering can bridge this gap, most teachers
lack the time or expertise and find it difficult to encode such pedagogical
nuance into their requests. This study shifts pedagogical expertise from the
user's prompt to the LLM's internal architecture. We embed the well-established
Knowledge-Learning-Instruction (KLI) framework into a Multi-Agent System (MAS)
to act as a sophisticated instructional designer. We tested three systems for
generating secondary Math and Science learning activities: a Single-Agent
baseline simulating typical teacher prompts; a role-based MAS where agents work
sequentially; and a collaborative MAS-CMD where agents co-construct activities
through conquer and merge discussion. The generated materials were evaluated by
20 practicing teachers and a complementary LLM-as-a-judge system using the
Quality Matters (QM) K-12 standards. While the rubric scores showed only small,
often statistically insignificant differences between the systems, the
qualitative feedback from educators painted a clear and compelling picture.
Teachers strongly preferred the activities from the collaborative MAS-CMD,
describing them as significantly more creative, contextually relevant, and
classroom-ready. Our findings show that embedding pedagogical principles into
LLM systems offers a scalable path for creating high-quality educational
content.

TL;DR: 本文认为情境感知(SA)是灾害韧性的关键能力，提出了技术-流程-人员的路线图，通过系统集成和认知保护来提升灾害响应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾害经常超出既定风险模型，揭示出盲点，需要更好的能力来感知、解释和预测动态危机状况。

Method: 提出技术-流程-人员三位一体的路线图，包括实时灾害预报、互操作工作流、赋能团队，采用系统集成方法实现联邦数据所有权和模块化分析。

Result: 展示了如何将原始数据转化为可操作的洞察，使多个机构能够共享及时更新而不牺牲各自的操作模式。

Conclusion: 需要将情境感知提升为核心灾害韧性目标，建议进一步研究SA指标、可信人机协作和包容性数据治理。

Abstract: Disasters frequently exceed established hazard models, revealing blind spots
where unforeseen impacts and vulnerabilities hamper effective response. This
perspective paper contends that situational awareness (SA)-the ability to
perceive, interpret, and project dynamic crisis conditions-is an often
overlooked yet vital capability for disaster resilience. While risk mitigation
measures can reduce known threats, not all hazards can be neutralized; truly
adaptive resilience hinges on whether organizations rapidly detect emerging
failures, reconcile diverse data sources, and direct interventions where they
matter most. We present a technology-process-people roadmap, demonstrating how
real-time hazard nowcasting, interoperable workflows, and empowered teams
collectively transform raw data into actionable insight. A system-of-systems
approach enables federated data ownership and modular analytics, so multiple
agencies can share timely updates without sacrificing their distinct
operational models. Equally crucial, structured sense-making routines and
cognitive load safeguards help humans remain effective decision-makers amid
data abundance. By framing SA as a socio-technical linchpin rather than a
peripheral add-on, this paper spotlights the urgency of elevating SA to a core
disaster resilience objective. We conclude with recommendations for further
research-developing SA metrics, designing trustworthy human-AI collaboration,
and strengthening inclusive data governance-to ensure that communities are
equipped to cope with both expected and unexpected crises.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI开发者如何报告模型风险，比较开发者报告的风险与研究者识别风险及真实世界AI事件的差异

Method: 从Hugging Face平台分析近46万份AI模型卡片，提取约3000个独特风险提及，构建AI模型风险目录，并与MIT风险库和AI事件数据库进行对比

Result: 开发者主要关注偏见、安全等技术问题，研究者更关注广泛的社会影响，双方都较少关注欺诈和操纵等人机交互导致的常见危害

Conclusion: 需要更清晰、结构化的风险报告框架，帮助开发者在设计早期考虑人机交互和系统性风险

Abstract: We analyzed nearly 460,000 AI model cards from Hugging Face to examine how
developers report risks. From these, we extracted around 3,000 unique risk
mentions and built the \emph{AI Model Risk Catalog}. We compared these with
risks identified by researchers in the MIT Risk Repository and with real-world
incidents from the AI Incident Database. Developers focused on technical issues
like bias and safety, while researchers emphasized broader social impacts. Both
groups paid little attention to fraud and manipulation, which are common harms
arising from how people interact with AI. Our findings show the need for
clearer, structured risk reporting that helps developers think about
human-interaction and systemic risks early in the design process. The catalog

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本研究系统分析了LLM在跨文化招聘评估中的偏见问题，发现印度求职者面试文本得分显著低于英国求职者，这种差异与语言特征相关，而非姓名身份信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在招聘中的广泛应用，特别是LLM可能影响甚至做出招聘决策，但缺乏对跨文化背景下AI驱动招聘评估偏见的系统研究，存在公平性和信任的紧迫关切。

Method: 使用两个数据集（100份英国和100份印度求职者面试文本），首先分析LLM生成的雇佣性评分差异，然后对印度数据集进行受控身份替换（性别、种姓、地区姓名）测试基于姓名的偏见。

Result: 印度文本得分持续低于英国文本，即使匿名处理后差异仍然存在，且与句子复杂性和词汇多样性等语言特征相关。身份替换未产生统计显著影响，表明孤立于其他上下文信号的姓名本身可能不影响LLM评估。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在LLM驱动评估中同时评估语言和社会维度的重要性，并指出AI辅助招聘需要文化敏感的设计和问责机制。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in hiring, with large
language models (LLMs) having the potential to influence or even make hiring
decisions. However, this raises pressing concerns about bias, fairness, and
trust, particularly across diverse cultural contexts. Despite their growing
role, few studies have systematically examined the potential biases in
AI-driven hiring evaluation across cultures. In this study, we conduct a
systematic analysis of how LLMs assess job interviews across cultural and
identity dimensions. Using two datasets of interview transcripts, 100 from UK
and 100 from Indian job seekers, we first examine cross-cultural differences in
LLM-generated scores for hirability and related traits. Indian transcripts
receive consistently lower scores than UK transcripts, even when they were
anonymized, with disparities linked to linguistic features such as sentence
complexity and lexical diversity. We then perform controlled identity
substitutions (varying names by gender, caste, and region) within the Indian
dataset to test for name-based bias. These substitutions do not yield
statistically significant effects, indicating that names alone, when isolated
from other contextual signals, may not influence LLM evaluations. Our findings
underscore the importance of evaluating both linguistic and social dimensions
in LLM-driven evaluations and highlight the need for culturally sensitive
design and accountability in AI-assisted hiring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别和分析AI未来发展辨论中的根本分歧，揭示这些争论实质上是主观哲学观点的差异，而非技术本身的客观分歧。研究希望通过这种分析来更清晰地理解相关争论的本质和动困。

Method: 采用哲学分析方法，将AI未来辨论中的不同观点分为"变革派"和"u7591疑派"两大派别，并在每个派别内部区分"强"和"u5f31"变体。重点分析了三个核心问题：非生物智能的可能性、技术预测的时间框架、技术发展的偏向轨迹。

Result: 研究发现AI未来辨论中的根本分歧来自于不同的哲学假设和主观观点，而非技术本身的客观差异。变革派面临较大的论证压力，并创造了竞争压力以获得首动优势。研究还指出需要扩宽AI未来发展辨论中的"专业知识"概念。

Conclusion: 论文强调了AI未来辨论的主观性质和哲学根源，建议在辨论中更清晰地识别和承认这些根本性分歧。研究还引发了对专业知识范围的重新考虑，建议在AI未来发展的讨论中包含更广泛的视角和专业知识。

Abstract: This study demonstrates the extent to which prominent debates about the
future of AI are best understood as subjective, philosophical disagreements
over the history and future of technological change rather than as objective,
material disagreements over the technologies themselves. It focuses on the deep
disagreements over whether artificial general intelligence (AGI) will prove
transformative for human society; a question that is analytically prior to that
of whether this transformative effect will help or harm humanity. The study
begins by distinguishing two fundamental camps in this debate. The first of
these can be identified as "transformationalists," who argue that continued AI
development will inevitably have a profound effect on society. Opposed to them
are "skeptics," a more eclectic group united by their disbelief that AI can or
will live up to such high expectations. Each camp admits further "strong" and
"weak" variants depending on their tolerance for epistemic risk. These stylized
contrasts help to identify a set of fundamental questions that shape the camps'
respective interpretations of the future of AI. Three questions in particular
are focused on: the possibility of non-biological intelligence, the appropriate
time frame of technological predictions, and the assumed trajectory of
technological development. In highlighting these specific points of
non-technical disagreement, this study demonstrates the wide range of different
arguments used to justify either the transformationalist or skeptical position.
At the same time, it highlights the strong argumentative burden of the
transformationalist position, the way that belief in this position creates
competitive pressures to achieve first-mover advantage, and the need to widen
the concept of "expertise" in debates surrounding the future development of AI.

Motivation: 探讨生成式AI和大型语言模型在学术研究和教育领域的应用潜力、机遇与风险，为相关领域的批判性讨论提供基础。

Method: 通过追溯AI到生成式系统的概念演变，分析技术要素（提示策略、词嵌入、概率采样等），并评估GenAI在研究全流程和教学各环节的整合应用。

Result: 系统梳理了GenAI的技术基础和应用场景，识别了其在研究和教育中的机遇与局限性，特别是伦理、社会和环境方面的挑战。

Conclusion: 生成式AI具有变革性潜力，但需要关注其伦理社会影响和可持续发展，未来可能面临持续采用、监管或衰退等不同发展情景。

Abstract: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the development, functioning,
and application of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large
language models (LLMs), with an emphasis on their implications for research and
education. It traces the conceptual evolution from artificial intelligence (AI)
through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) to transformer
architectures, which constitute the foundation of contemporary generative
systems. Technical aspects, including prompting strategies, word embeddings,
and probabilistic sampling methods (temperature, top-k, and top-p), are
examined alongside the emergence of autonomous agents. These elements are
considered in relation to both the opportunities they create and the
limitations and risks they entail.
  The work critically evaluates the integration of GenAI across the research
process, from ideation and literature review to research design, data
collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination. While particular
attention is given to geographical research, the discussion extends to wider
academic contexts. A parallel strand addresses the pedagogical applications of
GenAI, encompassing course and lesson design, teaching delivery, assessment,
and feedback, with geography education serving as a case example.
  Central to the analysis are the ethical, social, and environmental challenges
posed by GenAI. Issues of bias, intellectual property, governance, and
accountability are assessed, alongside the ecological footprint of LLMs and
emerging technological strategies for mitigation. The concluding section
considers near- and long-term futures of GenAI, including scenarios of
sustained adoption, regulation, and potential decline. By situating GenAI
within both scholarly practice and educational contexts, the study contributes
to critical debates on its transformative potential and societal
responsibilities.

Method: 开发直观界面让教师能够从正式课程中创建场景化活动，利用LLMs和社交机器人。与4名教师共同设计活动框架，并在27名学生中进行了1周的部署研究。

Result: 系统效能得到验证，孩子们对整合政策有积极感知，场景化活动特别是讲故事方式显著提高了学生的学习乐趣。

Conclusion: 研究证明了利用LLMs和社交机器人在教室活动中的可行性，场景化活动对学生享受度有显著积极影响，同时讨论了长期应用的多种含义。

Abstract: Creating and improvising scenarios for content approaching is an enriching
technique in education. However, it comes with a significant increase in the
time spent on its planning, which intensifies when using complex technologies,
such as social robots. Furthermore, addressing multicultural integration is
commonly embedded in regular activities due to the already tight curriculum.
Addressing these issues with a single solution, we implemented an intuitive
interface that allows teachers to create scenario-based activities from their
regular curriculum using LLMs and social robots. We co-designed different
frameworks of activities with 4 teachers and deployed it in a study with 27
students for 1 week. Beyond validating the system's efficacy, our findings
highlight the positive impact of integration policies perceived by the children
and demonstrate the importance of scenario-based activities in students'
enjoyment, observed to be significantly higher when applying storytelling.
Additionally, several implications of using LLMs and social robots in long-term
classroom activities are discussed.

Abstract: In recent years, breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) technology
have triggered global industrial transformations, with applications permeating
various fields such as finance, healthcare, education, and manufacturing.
However, this rapid iteration is accompanied by irrational development, where
enterprises blindly invest due to technology hype, often overlooking systematic
value assessments. This paper develops a multi-dimensional evaluation model
that integrates information theory's entropy reduction principle, economics'
bounded rationality framework, and psychology's irrational decision theories to
quantify AI product value. Key factors include positive dimensions (e.g.,
uncertainty elimination, efficiency gains, cost savings, decision quality
improvement) and negative risks (e.g., error probability, impact, and
correction costs). A non-linear formula captures factor couplings, and
validation through 10 commercial cases demonstrates the model's effectiveness
in distinguishing successful and failed products, supporting hypotheses on
synergistic positive effects, non-linear negative impacts, and interactive
regulations. Results reveal value generation logic, offering enterprises tools
to avoid blind investments and promote rational AI industry development. Future
directions include adaptive weights, dynamic mechanisms, and extensions to

Motivation: 虽然变换器模型在其他任务中表现优异，但在自动语文评分领域被其他深度学习架构超过，需要通过上下文增强来改善变换器模型的性能

Method: 使用ASAP-AES数据集，分析多种上下文因素对变换器模型性能的影响，构建了多维上下文增强的最佳模型

Result: 最佳模型在全部论文数据集上平均QWK得分0.823，在单个论文集上达到0.8697，在8个论文集中有3个表现超过最先进模型

Conclusion: 这种上下文增强方法与架构改进相互独立，可应用于任何AES模型，为教育自动化评价提供了灵活有效的提升技术

Abstract: Automated Essay Scoring (AES) has emerged to prominence in response to the
growing demand for educational automation. Providing an objective and
cost-effective solution, AES standardises the assessment of extended responses.
Although substantial research has been conducted in this domain, recent
investigations reveal that alternative deep-learning architectures outperform
transformer-based models. Despite the successful dominance in the performance
of the transformer architectures across various other tasks, this discrepancy
has prompted a need to enrich transformer-based AES models through contextual
enrichment.
  This study delves into diverse contextual factors using the ASAP-AES dataset,
analysing their impact on transformer-based model performance. Our most
effective model, augmented with multiple contextual dimensions, achieves a mean
Quadratic Weighted Kappa score of 0.823 across the entire essay dataset and
0.8697 when trained on individual essay sets. Evidently surpassing prior
transformer-based models, this augmented approach only underperforms relative
to the state-of-the-art deep learning model trained essay-set-wise by an
average of 3.83\% while exhibiting superior performance in three of the eight
sets.
  Importantly, this enhancement is orthogonal to architecture-based
advancements and seamlessly adaptable to any AES model. Consequently, this
contextual augmentation methodology presents a versatile technique for refining
AES capabilities, contributing to automated grading and evaluation evolution in
educational settings.

Motivation: 知识追踪模型容易受到标签泄漏的影响，特别是在每题包含多个知识点的数据集中，输入数据可能不小心暴露正确答案

Method: 使用MASK标签替代真实标签来防止标签泄漏，以及采用近期编码技术来建模学习动态和遗忘现象

Result: 在DKT、DKT+、AKT、SAKT等多个KT模型中集成该方法后，在多个基准测试中一致提升了预测准确性

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，效率高且应用范围广，能够有效解决KT模型中的标签泄漏问题并提升性能

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to predict a student's future performance based
on their sequence of interactions with learning content. Many KT models rely on
knowledge concepts (KCs), which represent the skills required for each item.
However, some of these models are vulnerable to label leakage, in which input
data inadvertently reveal the correct answer, particularly in datasets with
multiple KCs per question.
  We propose a straightforward yet effective solution to prevent label leakage
by masking ground-truth labels during input embedding construction in cases
susceptible to leakage. To accomplish this, we introduce a dedicated MASK
label, inspired by masked language modeling (e.g., BERT), to replace
ground-truth labels. In addition, we introduce Recency Encoding, which encodes
the step-wise distance between the current item and its most recent previous
occurrence. This distance is important for modeling learning dynamics such as
forgetting, which is a fundamental aspect of human learning, yet it is often
overlooked in existing models. Recency Encoding demonstrates improved
performance over traditional positional encodings on multiple KT benchmarks.
  We show that incorporating our embeddings into KT models like DKT, DKT+, AKT,
and SAKT consistently improves prediction accuracy across multiple benchmarks.
The approach is both efficient and widely applicable.

Conclusion: SimCourt框架展示了基于大语言模型的法庭模拟在提升法律教育和判决预测方面的巨大潜力，为创建更可信和实用的法庭模拟系统提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Mock trial has long served as an important platform for legal professional
training and education. It not only helps students learn about realistic trial
procedures, but also provides practical value for case analysis and judgment
prediction. Traditional mock trials are difficult to access by the public
because they rely on professional tutors and human participants. Fortunately,
the rise of large language models (LLMs) provides new opportunities for
creating more accessible and scalable court simulations. While promising,
existing research mainly focuses on agent construction while ignoring the
systematic design and evaluation of court simulations, which are actually more
important for the credibility and usage of court simulation in practice. To
this end, we present the first court simulation framework -- SimCourt -- based
on the real-world procedure structure of Chinese courts. Our framework
replicates all 5 core stages of a Chinese trial and incorporates 5 courtroom
roles, faithfully following the procedural definitions in China. To simulate
trial participants with different roles, we propose and craft legal agents
equipped with memory, planning, and reflection abilities. Experiment on legal
judgment prediction show that our framework can generate simulated trials that
better guide the system to predict the imprisonment, probation, and fine of
each case. Further annotations by human experts show that agents' responses
under our simulation framework even outperformed judges and lawyers from the
real trials in many scenarios. These further demonstrate the potential of
LLM-based court simulation.

### [642] [Bias Amplification in Stable Diffusion's Representation of Stigma Through Skin Tones and Their Homogeneity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17465)
*Kyra Wilson,Sourojit Ghosh,Aylin Caliskan*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究发现Stable Diffusion XL版本在生成图像时对污名化身份存在肤色偏见，相比前代模型产生更暗肤色、更少红色调，且肤色多样性降低，强化了社会刻板印象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究文本到图像生成器（T2Is）可能产生的社会刻板印象问题，特别是关于种族和肤色的偏见，通过系统评估不同版本Stable Diffusion模型的表现。

Method: 使用93种污名化身份作为测试集，分析三个Stable Diffusion版本（v1.5、v2.1和XL）生成的图像肤色特征，并与人类面部数据集进行比较。

Result: SD XL产生比前代模型暗13.53%、红调少23.76%的肤色，肤色多样性降低约30%，60.29%污名化身份的肤色多样性低于非污名化身份。

Conclusion: SD XL作为最复杂且用户偏好的模型，其肤色偏见问题会放大T2Is中的偏见，增加代表性伤害，并给生成多样化污名化身份图像带来挑战。

Abstract: Text-to-image generators (T2Is) are liable to produce images that perpetuate
social stereotypes, especially in regards to race or skin tone. We use a
comprehensive set of 93 stigmatized identities to determine that three versions
of Stable Diffusion (v1.5, v2.1, and XL) systematically associate stigmatized
identities with certain skin tones in generated images. We find that SD XL
produces skin tones that are 13.53% darker and 23.76% less red (both of which
indicate higher likelihood of societal discrimination) than previous models and
perpetuate societal stereotypes associating people of color with stigmatized
identities. SD XL also shows approximately 30% less variability in skin tones
when compared to previous models and 18.89-56.06% compared to human face
datasets. Measuring variability through metrics which directly correspond to
human perception suggest a similar pattern, where SD XL shows the least amount
of variability in skin tones of people with stigmatized identities and depicts
most (60.29%) stigmatized identities as being less diverse than non-stigmatized
identities. Finally, SD shows more homogenization of skin tones of racial and
ethnic identities compared to other stigmatized or non-stigmatized identities,
reinforcing incorrect equivalence of biologically-determined skin tone and
socially-constructed racial and ethnic identity. Because SD XL is the largest
and most complex model and users prefer its generations compared to other
models examined in this study, these findings have implications for the
dynamics of bias amplification in T2Is, increasing representational harms and
challenges generating diverse images depicting people with stigmatized
identities.

Motivation: 现有的AI方法没有显式地推理学生的编程技能，需要开发能够理解学生编程能力分类的检测模型来提供个性化支持。

Method: 与教育工作者合作开发编程能力分类法，构建PTM模型同时学习学生的编码历史技能并预测新任务中的困难。

Result: 在两个入门级Java和Python课程数据集上的实验结果表明，PTM模型在预测困难学生方面优于最先进的模型。

Conclusion: 展示了结合教师结构化见解的潜力，能够早期识别需要编程学习帮助的学生。

Abstract: Early detection of struggling student programmers is crucial for providing
them with personalized support. While multiple AI-based approaches have been
proposed for this problem, they do not explicitly reason about students'
programming skills in the model. This study addresses this gap by developing in
collaboration with educators a taxonomy of proficiencies that categorizes how
students solve coding tasks and is embedded in the detection model. Our model,
termed the Proficiency Taxonomy Model (PTM), simultaneously learns the
student's coding skills based on their coding history and predicts whether they
will struggle on a new task. We extensively evaluated the effectiveness of the
PTM model on two separate datasets from introductory Java and Python courses
for beginner programmers. Experimental results demonstrate that PTM outperforms
state-of-the-art models in predicting struggling students. The paper showcases
the potential of combining structured insights from teachers for early
identification of those needing assistance in learning to code.

Abstract: Urban climate resilience requires more than high-resolution data; it demands
systems that embed data collection, interpretation, and action within the daily
lives of citizens. This chapter presents a scalable, citizen-centric framework
that reimagines environmental infrastructure through participatory sensing,
open analytics, and prescriptive urban planning tools. Applied in Pune, India,
the framework comprises three interlinked modules: (1) a smartphone-based
measurement toolkit enhanced by AI segmentation to extract tree height, canopy
diameter, and trunk girth; (2) a percentile-based model using satellite-derived
Land Surface Temperature to calculate localized cooling through two new
metrics, Cooling Efficacy and Ambient Heat Relief; and (3) an eco-routing
engine that guides mobility using a Static Environmental Quality score, based
on tree density, species diversity, and cumulative carbon sequestration.
Together, these modules form a closed feedback loop where citizens generate
actionable data and benefit from personalized, sustainable interventions. This
framework transforms open data from a passive repository into an active
platform for shared governance and environmental equity. In the face of growing
ecological inequality and data centralization, this chapter presents a
replicable model for citizen-driven urban intelligence, reframing planning as a
co-produced, climate-resilient, and radically local practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法公平性研究往往采用单轴或形式子群框架，简化了社会现实并忽视了结构性不平等，需要将交叉性理论融入算法公平研究

Method: 基于Green的实质性算法公平概念，结合交叉性女权主义理论，提出实质性交叉算法公平框架，并在ROOF方法论中引入10个设计原则

Result: 提供了可操作的指导原则，促进算法系统在设计、评估和部署时考虑系统性不平等，减轻对交叉边缘化社区的伤害

Conclusion: 公平性不能脱离社会背景，有时需要原则性地不部署算法系统，通过连接计算和社会科学视角，为更公平、包容和情境敏感的交叉算法实践提供指导

Abstract: Intersectionality has profoundly influenced research and political action by
revealing how interconnected systems of privilege and oppression influence
lived experiences, yet its integration into algorithmic fairness research
remains limited. Existing approaches often rely on single-axis or formal
subgroup frameworks that risk oversimplifying social realities and neglecting
structural inequalities. We propose Substantive Intersectional Algorithmic
Fairness, extending Green's (2022) notion of substantive algorithmic fairness
with insights from intersectional feminist theory. Building on this foundation,
we introduce ten desiderata within the ROOF methodology to guide the design,
assessment, and deployment of algorithmic systems in ways that address systemic
inequities while mitigating harms to intersectionally marginalized communities.
Rather than prescribing fixed operationalizations, these desiderata encourage
reflection on assumptions of neutrality, the use of protected attributes, the
inclusion of multiply marginalized groups, and enhancing algorithmic systems'
potential. Our approach emphasizes that fairness cannot be separated from
social context, and that in some cases, principled non-deployment may be
necessary. By bridging computational and social science perspectives, we
provide actionable guidance for more equitable, inclusive, and
context-sensitive intersectional algorithmic practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于代理的方法在复现数学公式和算法逻辑等实现细节时存在困难，而人类使用系统化检查表调试代码的方式启发了本研究的思路。

Method: 框架首先自动提取论文指纹（准确原子化的标准集合），然后基于提取信息生成代码，并在迭代验证和精炼循环中利用指纹进行系统化差异检测和针对性修订。

Result: 在PaperBench Code-Dev基准测试中，RePro相比基线方法实现了13.0%的性能提升，能够正确修订复杂的逻辑和数学标准。

Conclusion: RePro框架通过论文指纹提取和迭代反思机制，有效解决了机器学习论文复现中的实现细节准确性问题，为自动化论文复现提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reproducing machine learning papers is essential for scientific progress but
remains challenging for both humans and automated agents. Existing agent-based
methods often struggle to fully and accurately reproduce implementation details
such as mathematical formulas and algorithmic logic. Previous studies show that
reflection with explicit feedback improves agent performance. However, current
paper reproduction methods fail to effectively adopt this strategy. This gap
mainly arises from the diverse paper patterns, complex method modules, and
varied configurations encountered in research papers. Motivated by how humans
use systematic checklists to efficiently debug complex code, we propose
\textbf{RePro}, a \textbf{Re}flective Paper-to-Code \textbf{Repro}duction
framework that automatically extracts a paper's fingerprint, referring to a
comprehensive set of accurate and atomic criteria serving as high-quality
supervisory signals. The framework first generates code based on the extracted
information, and then leverages the fingerprint within iterative verification
and refinement loop. This approach systematically detects discrepancies and
produces targeted revisions to align generated code with the paper's
implementation details. Extensive experiments on the PaperBench Code-Dev
benchmark have been conducted, RePro achieves 13.0\% performance gap over
baselines, and it correctly revises complex logical and mathematical criteria
in reflecting, on which the effectiveness is obvious.

Motivation: 现有AI驱动的Web自动化方案主要针对设计良好的消费级网站，无法有效处理设计不佳的企业内部Web界面，存在执行一致性差、元素识别不准、缺乏基准数据等问题。

Method: 提出Cybernaut框架，包含三个核心组件：1)SOP生成器将用户演示转换为可靠的自动化指令；2)高精度HTML DOM元素识别系统；3)执行一致性量化评估指标。

Result: 在内部基准测试中，任务执行成功率从72%提升至88.68%(提升23.2%)，执行模式识别准确率达到84.7%，能够进行可靠的置信度评估和自适应指导。

Conclusion: Cybernaut在企业级Web自动化中表现出色，为未来Web自动化发展奠定了基础，特别适合处理复杂的企业内部Web界面自动化任务。

Abstract: The emergence of AI-driven web automation through Large Language Models
(LLMs) offers unprecedented opportunities for optimizing digital workflows.
However, deploying such systems within industry's real-world environments
presents four core challenges: (1) ensuring consistent execution, (2)
accurately identifying critical HTML elements, (3) meeting human-like accuracy
in order to automate operations at scale and (4) the lack of comprehensive
benchmarking data on internal web applications. Existing solutions are
primarily tailored for well-designed, consumer-facing websites (e.g.,
Amazon.com, Apple.com) and fall short in addressing the complexity of
poorly-designed internal web interfaces. To address these limitations, we
present Cybernaut, a novel framework to ensure high execution consistency in
web automation agents designed for robust enterprise use. Our contributions are
threefold: (1) a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) generator that converts
user demonstrations into reliable automation instructions for linear browsing
tasks, (2) a high-precision HTML DOM element recognition system tailored for
the challenge of complex web interfaces, and (3) a quantitative metric to
assess execution consistency. The empirical evaluation on our internal
benchmark demonstrates that using our framework enables a 23.2% improvement
(from 72% to 88.68%) in task execution success rate over the browser_use.
Cybernaut identifies consistent execution patterns with 84.7% accuracy,
enabling reliable confidence assessment and adaptive guidance during task
execution in real-world systems. These results highlight Cybernaut's
effectiveness in enterprise-scale web automation and lay a foundation for
future advancements in web automation.

TL;DR: CelloAI是一个本地部署的AI编程助手，利用大型语言模型和检索增强生成技术，帮助高能物理实验解决遗留代码文档化和在新架构上的代码生成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 下一代高能物理实验将产生前所未有的数据量，需要将高性能计算与传统高吞吐量计算集成。但将遗留软件移植到异构架构的挑战以及复杂科学代码库文档稀疏阻碍了HPC在HEP中的采用。

Method: 开发本地托管的CelloAI编码助手，采用检索增强生成(RAG)的LLM模型。包含代码文档化(生成Doxygen风格注释、文件级摘要、交互式聊天机器人)和代码生成(语法感知分块策略、调用图知识集成、性能优化建议)两大功能模块。

Result: 使用ATLAS、CMS和DUNE实验的真实HEP应用进行评估，比较不同嵌入模型的代码检索效果。结果表明AI助手能够增强代码理解并支持可靠的代码生成。

Conclusion: CelloAI能够在满足科学计算环境透明度和安全性要求的同时，有效提升代码理解能力和支持可靠的代码生成工作。

Abstract: Next-generation High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments will generate
unprecedented data volumes, necessitating High Performance Computing (HPC)
integration alongside traditional high-throughput computing. However, HPC
adoption in HEP is hindered by the challenge of porting legacy software to
heterogeneous architectures and the sparse documentation of these complex
scientific codebases. We present CelloAI, a locally hosted coding assistant
that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) to support HEP code documentation and generation. This local deployment
ensures data privacy, eliminates recurring costs and provides access to large
context windows without external dependencies. CelloAI addresses two primary
use cases, code documentation and code generation, through specialized
components. For code documentation, the assistant provides: (a) Doxygen style
comment generation for all functions and classes by retrieving relevant
information from RAG sources (papers, posters, presentations), (b) file-level
summary generation, and (c) an interactive chatbot for code comprehension
queries. For code generation, CelloAI employs syntax-aware chunking strategies
that preserve syntactic boundaries during embedding, improving retrieval
accuracy in large codebases. The system integrates callgraph knowledge to
maintain dependency awareness during code modifications and provides
AI-generated suggestions for performance optimization and accurate refactoring.
We evaluate CelloAI using real-world HEP applications from ATLAS, CMS, and DUNE
experiments, comparing different embedding models for code retrieval
effectiveness. Our results demonstrate the AI assistant's capability to enhance
code understanding and support reliable code generation while maintaining the
transparency and safety requirements essential for scientific computing
environments.

TL;DR: EyeMulator是一种训练代码语言模型的技术，通过模仿人类视觉注意力模式来提升模型在代码翻译、补全和摘要等任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的代码语言模型仅基于输入token的重要性进行训练，而人类开发者具有直觉性的注意力模式。通过利用人类眼动追踪数据，可以让模型学习更接近人类的注意力分布。

Method: 在LLM微调过程中，为每个输入token添加特殊权重到损失函数中，这些权重来源于软件工程任务中收集的人类眼动追踪数据，从而在训练过程中改变模型的注意力机制。

Result: EyeMulator在多个软件工程任务（代码翻译、补全、摘要）上优于强基线模型，消融研究表明改进确实源于模型学会了模仿人类注意力。

Conclusion: 通过整合人类视觉注意力数据，可以显著提升代码语言模型的性能，这种方法不需要在推理阶段使用眼动追踪数据，具有实用价值。

Abstract: Code language models (so-called CodeLLMs) are now commonplace in software
development. As a general rule, CodeLLMs are trained by dividing training
examples into input tokens and then learn importance of those tokens in a
process called machine attention. Machine attention is based solely on input
token salience to output token examples during training. Human software
developers are different, as humans intuitively know that some tokens are more
salient than others. While intuition itself is ineffable and a subject of
philosophy, clues about salience are present in human visual attention, since
people tend to look at more salient words more often. In this paper, we present
EyeMulator, a technique for training CodeLLMs to mimic human visual attention
while training for various software development tasks. We add special weights
for each token in each input example to the loss function used during LLM
fine-tuning. We draw these weights from observations of human visual attention
derived from a previously-collected publicly-available dataset of eye-tracking
experiments in software engineering tasks. These new weights ultimately induce
changes in the attention of the subject LLM during training, resulting in a
model that does not need eye-tracking data during inference. Our evaluation
shows that EyeMulator outperforms strong LLM baselines on several tasks such as
code translation, completion and summarization. We further show an ablation
study that demonstrates the improvement is due to subject models learning to
mimic human attention.

Conclusion: 随着AI编程助手普及和法律框架演变，主动的许可证合规管理对于负责任、风险感知的AI时代软件开发至关重要。

Abstract: Generative AI coding assistants (ACAs) are widely adopted yet pose serious
legal and compliance risks. ACAs can generate code governed by restrictive
open-source licenses (e.g., GPL), potentially exposing companies to litigation
or forced open-sourcing. Few developers are trained in these risks, and legal
standards vary globally, especially with outsourcing. Our article introduces
DevLicOps, a practical framework that helps IT leaders manage ACA-related
licensing risks through governance, incident response, and informed tradeoffs.
As ACA adoption grows and legal frameworks evolve, proactive license compliance
is essential for responsible, risk-aware software development in the AI era.

TL;DR: TriagerX是一个基于双transformer架构的bug分配系统，通过内容排名和开发者交互历史排名相结合的方法，显著提升了开发人员推荐的准确性，在多个数据集上超越现有最佳方法10%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预训练语言模型在bug分配任务中可能关注不相关的token，且未考虑开发者对类似bug的交互历史，导致推荐效果不理想。

Method: 采用双transformer架构，每个transformer使用最后三层生成推荐，结合内容排名和基于开发者历史交互的新型排名方法。

Result: 在五个数据集上超越所有九种transformer方法，Top-1和Top-3准确率提升超过10%。在工业部署中，组件推荐提升10%，开发人员推荐提升54%。

Conclusion: TriagerX通过双transformer架构和交互历史整合，有效解决了现有bug分配系统的局限性，在实际工业环境中表现出色。

Abstract: Pretrained Language Models or PLMs are transformer-based architectures that
can be used in bug triaging tasks. PLMs can better capture token semantics than
traditional Machine Learning (ML) models that rely on statistical features
(e.g., TF-IDF, bag of words). However, PLMs may still attend to less relevant
tokens in a bug report, which can impact their effectiveness. In addition, the
model can be sub-optimal with its recommendations when the interaction history
of developers around similar bugs is not taken into account. We designed
TriagerX to address these limitations. First, to assess token semantics more
reliably, we leverage a dual-transformer architecture. Unlike current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines that employ a single transformer
architecture, TriagerX collects recommendations from two transformers with each
offering recommendations via its last three layers. This setup generates a
robust content-based ranking of candidate developers. TriagerX then refines
this ranking by employing a novel interaction-based ranking methodology, which
considers developers' historical interactions with similar fixed bugs. Across
five datasets, TriagerX surpasses all nine transformer-based methods, including
SOTA baselines, often improving Top-1 and Top-3 developer recommendation
accuracy by over 10%. We worked with our large industry partner to successfully
deploy TriagerX in their development environment. The partner required both
developer and component recommendations, with components acting as proxies for
team assignments-particularly useful in cases of developer turnover or team
changes. We trained TriagerX on the partner's dataset for both tasks, and it
outperformed SOTA baselines by up to 10% for component recommendations and 54%
for developer recommendations.

Abstract: AI agents have recently shown significant promise in software engineering.
Much public attention has been transfixed on the topic of code generation from
Large Language Models (LLMs) via a prompt. However, software engineering is
much more than programming, and AI agents go far beyond instructions given by a
prompt.
  At the code level, common software tasks include code generation, testing,
and program repair. Design level software tasks may include architecture
exploration, requirements understanding, and requirements enforcement at the
code level. Each of these software tasks involves micro-decisions which can be
taken autonomously by an AI agent, aided by program analysis tools. This
creates the vision of an AI software engineer, where the AI agent can be seen
as a member of a development team.
  Conceptually, the key to successfully developing trustworthy agentic AI-based
software workflows will be to resolve the core difficulty in software
engineering - the deciphering and clarification of developer intent.
Specification inference, or deciphering the intent, thus lies at the heart of
many software tasks, including software maintenance and program repair. A
successful deployment of agentic technology into software engineering would
involve making conceptual progress in such intent inference via agents.
  Trusting the AI agent becomes a key aspect, as software engineering becomes
more automated. Higher automation also leads to higher volume of code being
automatically generated, and then integrated into code-bases. Thus to deal with
this explosion, an emerging direction is AI-based verification and validation
(V & V) of AI generated code. We posit that agentic software workflows in
future will include such AIbased V&V.

Result: 在95%的情况下两种语言存在统计显著的能耗差异，编程语言选择对能源效率有显著影响：模型训练阶段可差异99.16%，推理阶段可差异99.8%

Conclusion: 编程语言的选择在机器学习项目中对能源效率有重要影响，开发者应考虑环境友好性以减少碳排放

Abstract: The utilization of Machine Learning (ML) in contemporary software systems is
extensive and continually expanding. However, its usage is energy-intensive,
contributing to increased carbon emissions and demanding significant resources.
While numerous studies examine the performance and accuracy of ML, only a
limited few focus on its environmental aspects, particularly energy
consumption. In addition, despite emerging efforts to compare energy
consumption across various programming languages for specific algorithms and
tasks, there remains a gap specifically in comparing these languages for
ML-based tasks. This paper aims to raise awareness of the energy costs
associated with employing different programming languages for ML model training
and inference. Through this empirical study, we measure and compare the energy
consumption along with run-time performance of five regression and five
classification tasks implemented in Python and R, the two most popular
programming languages in this context. Our study results reveal a statistically
significant difference in costs between the two languages in 95% of the cases
examined. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that the choice of programming
language can influence energy efficiency significantly, up to 99.16% during
model training and up to 99.8% during inferences, for a given ML task.

Motivation: 当前的缺陷分析模型无法抓住AI系统的独特属性，而人工智能系统在各个领域的应用日益普及，需要专门的质量保证方法。

Method: 修改ODC框架以适应AI系统的数据、学习和思考方面，添加新属性、新严重级别，并替换为AI相关特征。应用于公开的机器学习错误数据集进行分析。

Result: 学习阶段的缺陷最为普遍且与高严重级别显著相关，而思考阶段的缺陷对可信过和准确性有不成比例影响。

Conclusion: AIODC框架能够识别高风险缺陷类别，为有针对性的质量保证措施提供信息支持。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has gained a lot of attention recently, it has been
utilized in several fields ranging from daily life activities, such as
responding to emails and scheduling appointments, to manufacturing and
automating work activities. Artificial Intelligence systems are mainly
implemented as software solutions, and it is essential to discover and remove
software defects to assure its quality using defect analysis which is one of
the major activities that contribute to software quality. Despite the
proliferation of AI-based systems, current defect analysis models fail to
capture their unique attributes. This paper proposes a framework inspired by
the Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC) paradigm and enables defect analysis
of Artificial Intelligence systems while recognizing its special attributes and
characteristics. This study demonstrated the feasibility of modifying ODC for
AI systems to classify its defects. The ODC was adjusted to accommodate the
Data, Learning, and Thinking aspects of AI systems which are newly introduced
classification dimensions. This adjustment involved the introduction of an
additional attribute to the ODC attributes, the incorporation of a new severity
level, and the substitution of impact areas with characteristics pertinent to
AI systems. The framework was showcased by applying it to a publicly available
Machine Learning bug dataset, with results analyzed through one-way and two-way
analysis. The case study indicated that defects occurring during the Learning
phase were the most prevalent and were significantly linked to high-severity
classifications. In contrast, defects identified in the Thinking phase had a
disproportionate effect on trustworthiness and accuracy. These findings
illustrate AIODC's capability to identify high-risk defect categories and
inform focused quality assurance measures.

*Robert Heumüller,Frank Ortmeier*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 这是首个现代代码审查自动化领域的系统性评估研究，分析了24项相关研究，揭示了标准化不足、数据集重用少等问题，并提出了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代代码审查需要消耗大量时间和资源，近年使用机器学习和深度学习自动化代码审查任务的研究越来越多，但存在任务定义、数据集和评估方法的异质性问题。

Method: 系统性调查了691篇公开出牌物，确定了24项相关研究，并从任务、模型、指标、基准线、结果、有效性问题和工具可用性等多个维度进行分析。

Result: 发现评估差异较大，共48种任务指标组合，其中22种仅在原始论文中使用，数据集重用率较低，同时识别出时间偏差等被忽视的挑战。

Conclusion: 研究为领域提供了清晰概览，支持新研究的框架构建，帮助避免常见坑险，促进评估实践的更大标准化。

Abstract: Modern Code Review (MCR) is a standard practice in software engineering, yet
it demands substantial time and resource investments. Recent research has
increasingly explored automating core review tasks using machine learning (ML)
and deep learning (DL). As a result, there is substantial variability in task
definitions, datasets, and evaluation procedures. This study provides the first
comprehensive analysis of MCR automation research, aiming to characterize the
field's evolution, formalize learning tasks, highlight methodological
challenges, and offer actionable recommendations to guide future research.
Focusing on the primary code review tasks, we systematically surveyed 691
publications and identified 24 relevant studies published between May 2015 and
April 2024. Each study was analyzed in terms of tasks, models, metrics,
baselines, results, validity concerns, and artifact availability. In
particular, our analysis reveals significant potential for standardization,
including 48 task metric combinations, 22 of which were unique to their
original paper, and limited dataset reuse. We highlight challenges and derive
concrete recommendations for examples such as the temporal bias threat, which
are rarely addressed so far. Our work contributes to a clearer overview of the
field, supports the framing of new research, helps to avoid pitfalls, and
promotes greater standardization in evaluation practices.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了A.S.E基准测试，用于评估LLM在仓库级别安全代码生成的能力，通过真实CVE仓库构建任务，使用容器化评估框架进行可重现的安全评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试存在不足：关注孤立代码片段、评估方法不稳定缺乏重现性、未能将输入上下文质量与输出安全性关联。需要更全面的安全评估方法。

Method: 从有CVE记录的真实仓库构建任务，保留完整仓库上下文（构建系统、跨文件依赖）。使用容器化评估框架和专家定义规则进行稳定、可审计的安全、构建质量和生成稳定性评估。

Result: 评估发现：Claude-3.7-Sonnet整体表现最佳；专有模型与开源模型安全差距很小，Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct获得最高安全分；简洁的"快速思考"解码策略在安全补丁方面持续优于复杂的"慢速思考"推理。

Conclusion: A.S.E提供了更全面的代码安全评估基准，揭示了当前LLM在安全代码生成方面的表现特点和优化策略，为后续研究和模型改进提供了重要参考。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in software
engineering necessitates rigorous security evaluation of their generated code.
However, existing benchmarks are inadequate, as they focus on isolated code
snippets, employ unstable evaluation methods that lack reproducibility, and
fail to connect the quality of input context with the security of the output.
To address these gaps, we introduce A.S.E (AI Code Generation Security
Evaluation), a benchmark for repository-level secure code generation. A.S.E
constructs tasks from real-world repositories with documented CVEs, preserving
full repository context like build systems and cross-file dependencies. Its
reproducible, containerized evaluation framework uses expert-defined rules to
provide stable, auditable assessments of security, build quality, and
generation stability. Our evaluation of leading LLMs on A.S.E reveals three key
findings: (1) Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieves the best overall performance. (2) The
security gap between proprietary and open-source models is narrow;
Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct attains the top security score. (3) Concise,
``fast-thinking'' decoding strategies consistently outperform complex,
``slow-thinking'' reasoning for security patching.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: DesCartes Builder是一个开源工具，用于系统化地构建基于机器学习的数字孪生原型和实例，通过可视化数据流范式简化ML模型的组合和重用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字孪生需要多个任务和领域相关的机器学习模型，但当前ML在数字孪生工程中的应用缺乏系统性方法，需要更结构化的设计工具。

Method: 开发开源工具DesCartes Builder，采用开放灵活的可视化数据流范式，集成参数化核心操作和ML算法库，支持ML模型的规范、组合和重用。

Result: 通过土木工程用例验证了工具的有效性和可用性，成功设计了用于预测结构塑性应变的实时数字孪生原型。

Conclusion: DesCartes Builder为数字孪生的机器学习管道工程提供了系统化解决方案，解决了当前ad hoc方法的问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Digital twins (DTs) are increasingly utilized to monitor, manage, and
optimize complex systems across various domains, including civil engineering. A
core requirement for an effective DT is to act as a fast, accurate, and
maintainable surrogate of its physical counterpart, the physical twin (PT). To
this end, machine learning (ML) is frequently employed to (i) construct
real-time DT prototypes using efficient reduced-order models (ROMs) derived
from high-fidelity simulations of the PT's nominal behavior, and (ii)
specialize these prototypes into DT instances by leveraging historical sensor
data from the target PT. Despite the broad applicability of ML, its use in DT
engineering remains largely ad hoc. Indeed, while conventional ML pipelines
often train a single model for a specific task, DTs typically require multiple,
task- and domain-dependent models. Thus, a more structured approach is required
to design DTs.
  In this paper, we introduce DesCartes Builder, an open-source tool to enable
the systematic engineering of ML-based pipelines for real-time DT prototypes
and DT instances. The tool leverages an open and flexible visual data flow
paradigm to facilitate the specification, composition, and reuse of ML models.
It also integrates a library of parameterizable core operations and ML
algorithms tailored for DT design. We demonstrate the effectiveness and
usability of DesCartes Builder through a civil engineering use case involving
the design of a real-time DT prototype to predict the plastic strain of a
structure.

### [659] [Predicting User Grasp Intentions in Virtual Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16582)
*Linghao Zeng*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该研究比较了分类和回归方法在VR中预测用户抓取意图的性能，发现LSTM回归模型在时序和距离误差方面表现更优，但精确手部姿态预测仍具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测VR中的用户意图对创造沉浸式体验至关重要，特别是在需要精确触觉反馈的复杂抓取任务中。

Method: 利用手部运动的时序数据，在810次试验中评估分类和回归方法，涉及不同物体类型、尺寸和操作方式。

Result: 分类模型难以跨用户泛化，性能不稳定；而基于LSTM的回归模型表现更稳健，在抓取前2秒关键窗口内时序误差小于0.25秒，距离误差约5-20厘米。

Conclusion: 回归模型能更好地适应VR中用户行为的动态复杂性，为通过自适应触觉反馈增强VR交互奠定了基础，并为实时预测用户动作的未来发展铺平道路。

Abstract: Predicting user intentions in virtual reality (VR) is crucial for creating
immersive experiences, particularly in tasks involving complex grasping motions
where accurate haptic feedback is essential. In this work, we leverage
time-series data from hand movements to evaluate both classification and
regression approaches across 810 trials with varied object types, sizes, and
manipulations. Our findings reveal that classification models struggle to
generalize across users, leading to inconsistent performance. In contrast,
regression-based approaches, particularly those using Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) networks, demonstrate more robust performance, with timing errors within
0.25 seconds and distance errors around 5-20 cm in the critical two-second
window before a grasp. Despite these improvements, predicting precise hand
postures remains challenging. Through a comprehensive analysis of user
variability and model interpretability, we explore why certain models fail and
how regression models better accommodate the dynamic and complex nature of user
behavior in VR. Our results underscore the potential of machine learning models
to enhance VR interactions, particularly through adaptive haptic feedback, and
lay the groundwork for future advancements in real-time prediction of user
actions in VR.

*Mosh Levy,Zohar Elyoseph,Yoav Goldberg*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究发现人类难以准确识别AI模型推理文本中的因果步骤关系，准确率仅29.3%，接近随机猜测水平，揭示了人类理解与模型实际计算过程之间的根本差距


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI模型生成逐步推理文本的普及，这些文本被视为理解模型计算过程的窗口。但需要验证人类对这些文本的理解是否与模型的实际计算过程相符

Method: 通过基于反事实测量的问题来评估人类识别推理文本中步骤间因果影响的能力，测量参与者的准确率并与随机水平比较

Result: 参与者准确率仅为29.3%，略高于随机水平(25%)，即使在高度一致的问题上多数投票准确率也只有42%，显示人类理解与模型计算过程存在显著差异

Conclusion: 推理文本不应被简单视为可解释性工具，而应作为需要研究的对象。理解模型使用语言的非人类方式是关键研究方向

Abstract: A new generation of AI models generates step-by-step reasoning text before
producing an answer. This text appears to offer a human-readable window into
their computation process, and is increasingly relied upon for transparency and
interpretability. However, it is unclear whether human understanding of this
text matches the model's actual computational process. In this paper, we
investigate a necessary condition for correspondence: the ability of humans to
identify which steps in a reasoning text causally influence later steps. We
evaluated humans on this ability by composing questions based on counterfactual
measurements and found a significant discrepancy: participant accuracy was only
29.3%, barely above chance (25%), and remained low (42%) even when evaluating
the majority vote on questions with high agreement. Our results reveal a
fundamental gap between how humans interpret reasoning texts and how models use
it, challenging its utility as a simple interpretability tool. We argue that
reasoning texts should be treated as an artifact to be investigated, not taken
at face value, and that understanding the non-human ways these models use
language is a critical research direction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AR导航系统通常依赖刚性输入方案或预定义命令，限制了丰富建筑数据的利用并阻碍了自然交互，需要能够解释灵活用户意图并在空间和语义上下文中进行推理的系统。

Method: 将建筑信息模型(BIM)与多智能体检索增强生成(RAG)框架集成，构建了三个基于大语言模型的智能体(Triage、Search、Response)，通过具身AR代理提供语音交互和移动功能。

Result: 真实用户研究显示系统可用性量表(SUS)得分为80.5，表明具有优秀的可用性，比较评估显示具身界面显著提高了用户对系统智能的感知。

Conclusion: 语言基础推理和具身化在用户中心AR导航系统设计中具有重要性和潜力，该系统展示了集成BIM和多智能体RAG框架的有效性。

Abstract: Delivering intelligent and adaptive navigation assistance in augmented
reality (AR) requires more than visual cues, as it demands systems capable of
interpreting flexible user intent and reasoning over both spatial and semantic
context. Prior AR navigation systems often rely on rigid input schemes or
predefined commands, which limit the utility of rich building data and hinder
natural interaction. In this work, we propose an embodied AR navigation system
that integrates Building Information Modeling (BIM) with a multi-agent
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework to support flexible,
language-driven goal retrieval and route planning. The system orchestrates
three language agents, Triage, Search, and Response, built on large language
models (LLMs), which enables robust interpretation of open-ended queries and
spatial reasoning using BIM data. Navigation guidance is delivered through an
embodied AR agent, equipped with voice interaction and locomotion, to enhance
user experience. A real-world user study yields a System Usability Scale (SUS)
score of 80.5, indicating excellent usability, and comparative evaluations show
that the embodied interface can significantly improves users' perception of
system intelligence. These results underscore the importance and potential of
language-grounded reasoning and embodiment in the design of user-centered AR
navigation systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对行动和言语障碍人群对通信设备的需求，传统基于外观的视线跟踪界面存在精度问题、非自主眼动和复杂命令集操作困难等挑战，需要开发更实用的解决方案。

Method: 开发多模态外观基于视线控制的虚拟键盘，结合深度学习技术和标准摄像头硬件，支持同步和异步命令选择模式，提供9个命令菜单可输入56个英文字符。

Result: 20名健全参与者测试显示：鼠标输入18.3字/分钟，眼动仪同步模式12.6字/分钟，摄像头同步模式10.94字/分钟。摄像头同步模式ITR达到80.29比特/分钟（命令级）和63.56比特/分钟（字母级）。

Conclusion: 该系统展示了良好的可用性和低工作负荷，特别适合资源有限环境下的无障碍通信应用，证明了基于普通摄像头的视线控制技术的实用价值。

Abstract: Over the past decade, the demand for communication devices has increased
among individuals with mobility and speech impairments. Eye-gaze tracking has
emerged as a promising solution for hands-free communication; however,
traditional appearance-based interfaces often face challenges such as accuracy
issues, involuntary eye movements, and difficulties with extensive command
sets. This work presents a multimodal appearance-based gaze-controlled virtual
keyboard that utilises deep learning in conjunction with standard camera
hardware, incorporating both synchronous and asynchronous modes for command
selection. The virtual keyboard application supports menu-based selection with
nine commands, enabling users to spell and type up to 56 English characters,
including uppercase and lowercase letters, punctuation, and a delete function
for corrections. The proposed system was evaluated with twenty able-bodied
participants who completed specially designed typing tasks using three input
modalities: (i) a mouse, (ii) an eye-tracker, and (iii) an unmodified webcam.
Typing performance was measured in terms of speed and information transfer rate
(ITR) at both command and letter levels. Average typing speeds were 18.3+-5.31
letters/min (mouse), 12.60+-2.99letters/min (eye-tracker, synchronous), 10.94
+- 1.89 letters/min (webcam, synchronous), 11.15 +- 2.90 letters/min
(eye-tracker, asynchronous), and 7.86 +- 1.69 letters/min (webcam,
asynchronous). ITRs were approximately 80.29 +- 15.72 bits/min (command level)
and 63.56 +- 11 bits/min (letter level) with webcam in synchronous mode. The
system demonstrated good usability and low workload with webcam input,
highlighting its user-centred design and promise as an accessible communication
tool in low-resource settings.

Method: 对25名AI从业者（工程、研究、UX、负责任AI等角色）进行访谈研究，分析工作流程和产出物对残障用户的影响

Result: 发现从业者在负责任AI与可访问性实践交叉点的问题分类时遇到摩擦，导航可访问性与负责任AI指南之间的矛盾，识别残障用户数据缺口，并通过公司内部志愿者和社区团体获取支持

Conclusion: 基于研究发现，提出了新的资源和流程改进建议，以更好地支持残障用户作为AI的最终用户

Abstract: The rapid emergence of generative AI has changed the way that technology is
designed, constructed, maintained, and evaluated. Decisions made when creating
AI-powered systems may impact some users disproportionately, such as people
with disabilities. In this paper, we report on an interview study with 25 AI
practitioners across multiple roles (engineering, research, UX, and responsible
AI) about how their work processes and artifacts may impact end users with
disabilities. We found that practitioners experienced friction when triaging
problems at the intersection of responsible AI and accessibility practices,
navigated contradictions between accessibility and responsible AI guidelines,
identified gaps in data about users with disabilities, and gathered support for
addressing the needs of disabled stakeholders by leveraging informal volunteer
and community groups within their company. Based on these findings, we offer
suggestions for new resources and process changes to better support people with
disabilities as end users of AI.

Motivation: AI社交媒体推荐系统虽然能改善用户体验，但经常与用户兴趣不匹配且缺乏可解释性，存在黑盒问题，需要从终端用户角度研究推荐系统的可理解性和透明度。

Method: 使用Facebook平台，招募常规用户进行定性分析，询问参与者关于社交媒体内容建议、可理解性和可解释性的看法。

Result: 分析显示用户主要在遇到不熟悉内容和确保在线数据安全时需要解释，要求简洁非技术性解释和可控信息流功能，解释影响用户对透明度、信任和理解度的感知。

Conclusion: 研究提出了基于数据分析的综合框架和一些设计启示，强调需要为用户提供可理解的解释机制来增强推荐系统的透明度和可信度。

Abstract: AI based social media recommendations have great potential to improve the
user experience. However, often these recommendations do not match the user
interest and create an unpleasant experience for the users. Moreover, the
recommendation system being a black box creates comprehensibility and
transparency issues. This paper investigates social media recommendations from
an end user perspective. For the investigation, we used the popular social
media platform Facebook and recruited regular users to conduct a qualitative
analysis. We asked participants about the social media content suggestions,
their comprehensibility, and explainability. Our analysis shows users mostly
require explanation whenever they encounter unfamiliar content and to ensure
their online data security. Furthermore, the users require concise,
non-technical explanations along with the facility of controlled information
flow. In addition, we observed that explanations impact the users perception of
transparency, trust, and understandability. Finally, we have outlined some
design implications and presented a synthesized framework based on our data
analysis.

Method: 结合大型语言模型(LLM)提供通用知识，BERT模型持续学习用户特定偏好，通过原始文本输入解析用户意图

Result: 真实用户研究显示top-1准确率达到71.35%，能够持续提升准确率和推理速度，用户满意度高

Conclusion: TextOnly相比手动操作更受用户偏好，比语音助手支持更多文本相关功能且输入更简洁，是一个有效的统一功能门户解决方案

Abstract: Text boxes serve as portals to diverse functionalities in today's smartphone
applications. However, when it comes to specific functionalities, users always
need to navigate through multiple steps to access particular text boxes for
input. We propose TextOnly, a unified function portal that enables users to
access text-related functions from various applications by simply inputting
text into a sole text box. For instance, entering a restaurant name could
trigger a Google Maps search, while a greeting could initiate a conversation in
WhatsApp. Despite their brevity, TextOnly maximizes the utilization of these
raw text inputs, which contain rich information, to interpret user intentions
effectively. TextOnly integrates large language models(LLM) and a BERT model.
The LLM consistently provides general knowledge, while the BERT model can
continuously learn user-specific preferences and enable quicker predictions.
Real-world user studies demonstrated TextOnly's effectiveness with a top-1
accuracy of 71.35%, and its ability to continuously improve both its accuracy
and inference speed. Participants perceived TextOnly as having satisfactory
usability and expressed a preference for TextOnly over manual executions.
Compared with voice assistants, TextOnly supports a greater range of
text-related functions and allows for more concise inputs.

Abstract: Biomechanical forward simulation holds great potential for HCI, enabling the
generation of human-like movements in interactive tasks. However, training
biomechanical models with reinforcement learning is challenging, particularly
for precise and dexterous movements like those required for touchscreen
interactions on mobile devices. Current approaches are limited in their
interaction fidelity, require restricting the underlying biomechanical model to
reduce complexity, and do not generalize well. In this work, we propose
practical improvements to training routines that reduce training time, increase
interaction fidelity beyond existing methods, and enable the use of more
complex biomechanical models. Using a touchscreen pointing task, we demonstrate
that curriculum learning, action masking, more complex network configurations,
and simple adjustments to the simulation environment can significantly improve
the agent's ability to learn accurate touch behavior. Our work provides HCI
researchers with practical tips and training routines for developing better
biomechanical models of human-like interaction fidelity.

Conclusion: 该库有助于实现更高效、可复现和可比较的WHAR研究，目前支持9个广泛使用的数据集，并易于扩展到新数据集。

Abstract: The lack of standardization across Wearable Human Activity Recognition (WHAR)
datasets limits reproducibility, comparability, and research efficiency. We
introduce WHAR datasets, an open-source library designed to simplify WHAR data
handling through a standardized data format and a configuration-driven design,
enabling reproducible and computationally efficient workflows with minimal
manual intervention. The library currently supports 9 widely-used datasets,
integrates with PyTorch and TensorFlow, and is easily extensible to new
datasets. To demonstrate its utility, we trained two state-of-the-art models,
TinyHar and MLP-HAR, on the included datasets, approximately reproducing
published results and validating the library's effectiveness for
experimentation and benchmarking. Additionally, we evaluated preprocessing
performance and observed speedups of up to 3.8x using multiprocessing. We hope
this library contributes to more efficient, reproducible, and comparable WHAR
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交机器人和聊天机器等人工智能代理的发展，需要理解这些技术作为社会实体的实际和潜在角色，以及它们如何参与社会身份过程。

Method: 通过对社会身份方法(SIA)的基础介绍，使用案例研究和假想示例来外推SIT和SCT理论如何应用于人工社交代理。

Result: 研究指出不是所有人类模型都适用于人工智能代理，并强调需要专家们批判性地考虑这些技术的社会影响，避免被它们的能力所骗。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在人工智能时代批判性思考的重要性，专家需要承担"奇怪杀意"的角色，以确保我们能够理性地应对这些新兴技术的社会含义和影响。

Abstract: Social identity theory (SIT) and social categorization theory (SCT) are two
facets of the social identity approach (SIA) to understanding social phenomena.
SIT and SCT are models that describe and explain how people interact with one
another socially, connecting the individual to the group through an
understanding of underlying psychological mechanisms and intergroup behaviour.
SIT, originally developed in the 1970s, and SCT, a later, more general
offshoot, have been broadly applied to a range of social phenomena among
people. The rise of increasingly social machines embedded in daily life has
spurned efforts on understanding whether and how artificial agents can and do
participate in SIA activities. As agents like social robots and chatbots
powered by sophisticated large language models (LLMs) advance, understanding
the real and potential roles of these technologies as social entities is
crucial. Here, I provide a primer on SIA and extrapolate, through case studies
and imagined examples, how SIT and SCT can apply to artificial social agents. I
emphasize that not all human models and sub-theories will apply. I further
argue that, given the emerging competence of these machines and our tendency to
be taken in by them, we experts may need to don the hat of the uncanny killjoy,
for our own good.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的光学计算平台，通过单一空间光调制器实现k-local Ising优化和光学KAN函数学习的并行处理，利用折叠4f中继系统将结构非线性转化为计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决光学计算中离散优化和连续函数学习需要不同硬件的问题，寻求在单一平台上实现两种计算模式的统一处理，提高计算效率和并行性。

Method: 采用折叠4f中继系统，通过空间光调制器实现二次相位调制，将每个自旋团或通道分配到独立窗口，利用光学传播的线性特性产生可编程的多项式强度响应。

Result: 实现了无需非线性介质的高阶Ising耦合和KAN层所需的多元非线性函数，支持物理梯度训练，硬件改动最小（仅需增加一个透镜和折叠）。

Conclusion: 该平台为高阶光学Ising优化和全光学KAN处理提供了低开销、大规模并行的解决方案，可在空间光子Ising机、VCSEL阵列和微软模拟光学计算机等平台上实现。

Abstract: We unify k-local Ising optimization and optical KAN function learning on a
single photonic platform, establishing a critical convergence point in optical
computing that enables interleaved discrete-continuous workflows. We introduce
a single spacial light modulator (SLM)-centric primitive that realizes, in one
stroke, all-optical k-local Ising interactions and fully optical
Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) layers. The central idea is to convert
structural nonlinearity of a nominally linear photonic scatterer into a
per-window computational resource by adding one relay pass through the same
spatial light modulator. A folded 4f relay reimages the first Fourier plane
onto the SLM so that each chosen spin clique or ridge channel occupies a
disjoint window with its own second-pass phase patch. Propagation remains
linear in the optical field, yet the measured intensity in each window becomes
a freely programmable polynomial of the clique sum or projection amplitude.
This yields native, per-clique k-local couplings without nonlinear media and,
in parallel, the many independent univariate nonlinearities required by KAN
layers, all with in-situ physical gradients for training using two-frame
(forward and adjoint) physical gradients. We outline implementation on spatial
photonic Ising machines, injection-locked VCSEL arrays, and the Microsoft
analog optical computers. In all cases the hardware change is one extra lens
and a fold (or an on-chip 4f loop), enabling a minimal overhead, massively
parallel route to high-order optical Ising optimization and trainable,
all-optical KAN processing.
