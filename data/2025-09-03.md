### [1] [MultiStream-LLM: Bridging Modalities for Robust Sign Language Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00030)
*Marshall Thomas,Edward Fish,Richard Bowden*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MultiStream-LLM框架，通过分离处理连续手语、手指拼写和唇读三个模态，使用专门预测器分别解码后再融合，显著提升了手语翻译性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的端到端手语翻译模型在处理高速手指拼写和异步非手动面部线索时表现不佳，特别是在翻译人名、地名和技术术语等关键信息时效果差

Method: 采用模块化框架，使用三个专门的预测器分别处理连续手语、手指拼写和唇读，每个专家网络将其特定模态解码为token序列，然后通过轻量级transformer融合这些并行流，最后使用大语言模型生成最终句子

Result: 在How2Sign基准测试中达到BLEU-4分数23.5的新SOTA，在ChicagoFSWildPlus手指拼写数据集上达到73.2%的字母准确率

Conclusion: 通过分离和解决不同的识别任务再进行融合的多专家方法，为鲁棒、高保真的手语翻译提供了更强大有效的途径

Abstract: Despite progress in gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT), monolithic
end-to-end models consistently fail on two critical components of natural
signing: the precise recognition of high-speed fingerspelling and the
integration of asynchronous non-manual cues from the face. Recent progress in
Automated Sign Language Translation with Large Language Models has side stepped
this challenge, forcing a single network to learn these simultaneously
resulting in poor performance when tasked with translating crucial information
such as names,places, and technical terms. We introduce MultiStream-LLM, a
modular framework designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach employs
separate, specialized predictors for continuous signing, fingerspelling, and
lipreading. Each expert network first decodes its specific modality into a
sequence of tokens. These parallel streams are then fused by a lightweight
transformer that resolves temporal misalignments before passing the combined
representation to a Large Language Model (LLM) for final sentence generation.
Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on the How2Sign benchmark with a
BLEU-4 score of 23.5 and achieves 73.2% letter accuracy on the challenging
ChicagoFSWildPlus fingerspelling dataset. These results validate our core
hypothesis: by isolating and solving distinct recogni tion tasks before fusion,
our multi-expert approach provides a more powerful and effective pathway to
robust, high-fidelity sign language translation.

### [2] [Compiling Prompts, Not Crafting Them: A Reproducible Workflow for AI-Assisted Evidence Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00038)
*Teo Susnjak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文将声明式提示优化技术应用于系统文献综述，提出了一种可重现、可验证的LLM助手系统架构


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前LLM助手系统综述中手动制作提示的脆弱性问题，提高可靠性和可重现性，增强科学研究的信心

Method: 采用声明式提示优化技术，构建包含任务声明、测试套件和自动提示调优的领域特定框架，并提供工作代码示例

Result: 实现了一种符合证据综合透明性和严谨性原则的可验证LLM流水线，为SLR自动化领域提供了新的技术解决方案

Conclusion: 这是声明式提示优化技术在SLR流水线中的首次创新应用，为构建可靠、可重现的自动化文献综述系统提供了重要的技术基础

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential to accelerate
systematic literature reviews (SLRs), yet current approaches often rely on
brittle, manually crafted prompts that compromise reliability and
reproducibility. This fragility undermines scientific confidence in
LLM-assisted evidence synthesis. In response, this work adapts recent advances
in declarative prompt optimisation, developed for general-purpose LLM
applications, and demonstrates their applicability to the domain of SLR
automation. This research proposes a structured, domain-specific framework that
embeds task declarations, test suites, and automated prompt tuning into a
reproducible SLR workflow. These emerging methods are translated into a
concrete blueprint with working code examples, enabling researchers to
construct verifiable LLM pipelines that align with established principles of
transparency and rigour in evidence synthesis. This is a novel application of
such approaches to SLR pipelines.

### [3] [What Are Research Hypotheses?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00185)
*Jian Wu,Sarah Rajtmajer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文综述了自然语言处理领域中"假设"概念的不同定义，特别关注了近期NLU任务中的定义差异，强调了在机器可解释学术记录背景下明确定义的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着NLP技术的发展，各种任务中对"假设"概念的定义逐渐偏离传统科学定义，且NLU领域内部也存在定义差异，需要系统梳理和明确界定。

Method: 通过文献综述方法，系统梳理和分析近期发表的NLU任务中关于假设的各种定义，比较其与传统科学定义的差异。

Result: 识别出NLU领域中假设定义存在显著差异，这些定义在不同任务和文献中呈现出多样化的解释方式。

Conclusion: 在迈向机器可解释学术记录的过程中，需要建立结构良好、定义明确的假设概念框架，以确保学术交流的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: Over the past decades, alongside advancements in natural language processing,
significant attention has been paid to training models to automatically
extract, understand, test, and generate hypotheses in open and scientific
domains. However, interpretations of the term \emph{hypothesis} for various
natural language understanding (NLU) tasks have migrated from traditional
definitions in the natural, social, and formal sciences. Even within NLU, we
observe differences defining hypotheses across literature. In this paper, we
overview and delineate various definitions of hypothesis. Especially, we
discern the nuances of definitions across recently published NLU tasks. We
highlight the importance of well-structured and well-defined hypotheses,
particularly as we move toward a machine-interpretable scholarly record.

### [4] [Explainable Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: An Empirical Analysis on State-Aware Reasoning Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00190)
*Sheldon Yu,Yuxin Xiong,Junda Wu,Xintong Li,Tong Yu,Xiang Chen,Ritwik Sinha,Jingbo Shang,Julian McAuley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出状态感知转换框架，将思维链轨迹抽象为结构化潜在动态，通过谱分析和马尔可夫链建模推理过程的可解释语义状态和转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有思维链推理的可解释性有限，主要关注局部token级归因，缺乏对推理步骤高级语义角色和转换的探索。

Method: 使用谱分析对token级嵌入进行聚类，形成语义一致的潜在状态；通过马尔可夫链建模状态转换，提供结构化和可解释的推理视图。

Result: 框架支持语义角色识别、时序模式可视化和一致性评估等多种分析功能。

Conclusion: 该状态感知转换框架为思维链推理提供了更深入的结构化理解和可解释性分析工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting have enabled large
language models (LLMs) to perform multi-step reasoning. However, the
explainability of such reasoning remains limited, with prior work primarily
focusing on local token-level attribution, such that the high-level semantic
roles of reasoning steps and their transitions remain underexplored. In this
paper, we introduce a state-aware transition framework that abstracts CoT
trajectories into structured latent dynamics. Specifically, to capture the
evolving semantics of CoT reasoning, each reasoning step is represented via
spectral analysis of token-level embeddings and clustered into semantically
coherent latent states. To characterize the global structure of reasoning, we
model their progression as a Markov chain, yielding a structured and
interpretable view of the reasoning process. This abstraction supports a range
of analyses, including semantic role identification, temporal pattern
visualization, and consistency evaluation.

### [5] [The Rarity Blind Spot: A Framework for Evaluating Statistical Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00245)
*Seiji Maekawa,Hayate Iso,Nikita Bhutani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Distinctive Feature Mining (DFM)任务和DiFBench基准框架，评估LLM在文档集合中识别全局稀有特征的能力，发现现有模型在统计推理和稀有性检测方面存在显著局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注信息检索和摘要，但缺乏评估模型识别全局稀有特征的能力，而现实世界决策往往需要这种统计推理能力。

Method: 引入DFM任务，要求模型分析10-40个文档集合并识别出现频率低于10%的稀有特征；开发DiFBench可配置基准框架，对10个最先进LLM进行大规模评估。

Result: 发现通用模型与推理增强模型之间存在显著性能差距；所有模型在任务复杂度和文档数量增加时性能大幅下降；常见错误是将频繁特征误认为稀有特征。

Conclusion: 当代LLM在执行细粒度统计推理和稀有性检测方面存在核心局限性，需要改进模型在这方面的能力。

Abstract: Effective decision-making often relies on identifying what makes each
candidate distinctive. While existing benchmarks for LLMs emphasize retrieving
or summarizing information relevant to a given query, they do not evaluate a
model's ability to identify globally distinctive features across a set of
documents. We introduce Distinctive Feature Mining (DFM), a new task that
challenges models to analyze a small-to-medium collection (10-40 documents) and
surface features that are rare in the global context (e.g., appearing in less
than 10% of documents). This setting mirrors real-world scenarios such as
candidate selection or product differentiation, where statistical reasoning,
not retrieval, is key. To enable systematic evaluation of this capability, we
present DiFBench, a configurable benchmark creation framework with controllable
parameters such as document set size and distinctiveness thresholds. Using
DiFBench, we perform a large-scale assessment of distinctive feature mining
across ten state-of-the-art LLMs. Our findings reveal a significant performance
gap between general-purpose and reasoning-enhanced models. All models, however,
substantially degrade as the task complexity and document count increase. We
also find that a common failure mode is misidentifying frequent features as
distinctive. These insights reveal core limitations in contemporary LLMs'
abilities to perform fine-grained, statistical reasoning and rarity detection.

### [6] [The Differential Meaning of Models: A Framework for Analyzing the Structural Consequences of Semantic Modeling Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00248)
*Zachary K. Stine,James E. Deitrick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于皮尔斯符号学理论的通用框架，用于在统一标准下描述和比较不同的人类意义建构建模方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人类意义建构建模领域缺乏一个通用的理论框架来统一描述和比较各种模型类型，无法实现公平比较。

Method: 基于C.S. Peirce的符号学理论构建框架，将模型视为测量潜在符号几何的假设，并通过模型间的对比关系来理解其语义价值。

Result: 建立了一个将模型和建模决策本身视为符号的理论框架，并通过实证示例展示了该框架的应用。

Conclusion: 该框架为解决建模实践的统一描述问题提供了理论基础，并为未来的研究方向奠定了基础。

Abstract: The proliferation of methods for modeling of human meaning-making constitutes
a powerful class of instruments for the analysis of complex semiotic systems.
However, the field lacks a general theoretical framework for describing these
modeling practices across various model types in an apples-to-apples way. In
this paper, we propose such a framework grounded in the semiotic theory of C.
S. Peirce. We argue that such models measure latent symbol geometries, which
can be understood as hypotheses about the complex of semiotic agencies
underlying a symbolic dataset. Further, we argue that in contexts where a
model's value cannot be straightforwardly captured by proxy measures of
performance, models can instead be understood relationally, so that the
particular interpretive lens of a model becomes visible through its contrast
with other models. This forms the basis of a theory of model semantics in which
models, and the modeling decisions that constitute them, are themselves treated
as signs. In addition to proposing the framework, we illustrate its empirical
use with a few brief examples and consider foundational questions and future
directions enabled by the framework.

### [7] [The Temporal Game: A New Perspective on Temporal Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00250)
*Hugo Sousa,Ricardo Campos,Alípio Jorge*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Temporal Game，将时间关系抽取任务转化为交互式游戏，通过点对点比较分解区间关系，支持强化学习代理训练，并提供游戏模式和标注模式两种界面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间关系标注方法直接标注区间级关系存在局限性，需要更细粒度和灵活的方法来同时支持区间和瞬时实体的标注。

Method: 将时间关系分解为起点和终点之间的点对点比较，每一步玩家分类单个点关系，系统应用时间闭包推断额外关系并保持一致性。

Result: 开发了包含游戏模式和标注模式的演示系统，支持TempEval-3数据集标注和自定义文档标注，时间线可导出。

Conclusion: Temporal Game为时间推理和标注提供了新的研究工具和标注界面，支持社区驱动的进一步研究发展。

Abstract: In this paper we demo the Temporal Game, a novel approach to temporal
relation extraction that casts the task as an interactive game. Instead of
directly annotating interval-level relations, our approach decomposes them into
point-wise comparisons between the start and end points of temporal entities.
At each step, players classify a single point relation, and the system applies
temporal closure to infer additional relations and enforce consistency. This
point-based strategy naturally supports both interval and instant entities,
enabling more fine-grained and flexible annotation than any previous approach.
The Temporal Game also lays the groundwork for training reinforcement learning
agents, by treating temporal annotation as a sequential decision-making task.
To showcase this potential, the demo presented in this paper includes a Game
mode, in which users annotate texts from the TempEval-3 dataset and receive
feedback based on a scoring system, and an Annotation mode, that allows custom
documents to be annotated and resulting timeline to be exported. Therefore,
this demo serves both as a research tool and an annotation interface. The demo
is publicly available at https://temporal-game.inesctec.pt, and the source code
is open-sourced to foster further research and community-driven development in
temporal reasoning and annotation.

### [8] [Exploring Reasoning-Infused Text Embedding with Large Language Models for Zero-Shot Dense Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00276)
*Yuxiang Liu,Tian Wang,Gourab Kundu,Tianyu Cao,Guang Cheng,Zhen Ge,Jianshu Chen,Qingjun Cui,Trishul Chilimbi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RITE方法通过生成中间推理文本来增强文本嵌入，将逻辑推理融入生成式大语言模型的嵌入过程，显著提升了零样本检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的嵌入方法主要关注上下文表示，未能充分利用LLMs的强大推理能力来处理需要复杂推理的现实世界查询检索任务。

Method: 提出RITE方法，在计算嵌入之前先在token空间中生成中间推理文本，从而为表示增加推理深度，基于现有语言模型嵌入技术进行改进。

Result: 在推理密集型检索基准BRIGHT上的实验结果表明，RITE显著提升了跨多个领域的零样本检索性能。

Conclusion: 将推理过程融入嵌入生成是有效的，RITE方法成功地将LLMs的推理能力整合到文本嵌入过程中，为复杂检索任务提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based models such as BERT and E5 have significantly advanced text
embedding by capturing rich contextual representations. However, many complex
real-world queries require sophisticated reasoning to retrieve relevant
documents beyond surface-level lexical matching, where encoder-only retrievers
often fall short. Decoder-only large language models (LLMs), known for their
strong reasoning capabilities, offer a promising alternative. Despite this
potential, existing LLM-based embedding methods primarily focus on contextual
representation and do not fully exploit the reasoning strength of LLMs. To
bridge this gap, we propose Reasoning-Infused Text Embedding (RITE), a simple
but effective approach that integrates logical reasoning into the text
embedding process using generative LLMs. RITE builds upon existing language
model embedding techniques by generating intermediate reasoning texts in the
token space before computing embeddings, thereby enriching representations with
inferential depth. Experimental results on BRIGHT, a reasoning-intensive
retrieval benchmark, demonstrate that RITE significantly enhances zero-shot
retrieval performance across diverse domains, underscoring the effectiveness of
incorporating reasoning into the embedding process.

### [9] [OpinioRAG: Towards Generating User-Centric Opinion Highlights from Large-scale Online Reviews](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00285)
*Mir Tafseer Nayeem,Davood Rafiei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了OpinioRAG框架，通过RAG检索和LLM结合，从海量用户评论中生成个性化摘要，并设计了新的无参考验证指标来评估情感一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法处理数千条评论的规模，且生成的摘要过于通用，无法满足个性化需求，需要开发可扩展的个性化摘要生成方案。

Method: 结合RAG-based证据检索和LLMs，构建训练免费的OpinioRAG框架，并提出了针对情感丰富领域的无参考验证指标。

Result: 创建了首个大规模长评论数据集，通过实验验证了框架的有效性，能够生成准确、相关且结构化的摘要。

Conclusion: OpinioRAG为解决大规模评论摘要生成提供了有效方案，为未来研究奠定了基础，并展示了在准确性和相关性方面的优势。

Abstract: We study the problem of opinion highlights generation from large volumes of
user reviews, often exceeding thousands per entity, where existing methods
either fail to scale or produce generic, one-size-fits-all summaries that
overlook personalized needs. To tackle this, we introduce OpinioRAG, a
scalable, training-free framework that combines RAG-based evidence retrieval
with LLMs to efficiently produce tailored summaries. Additionally, we propose
novel reference-free verification metrics designed for sentiment-rich domains,
where accurately capturing opinions and sentiment alignment is essential. These
metrics offer a fine-grained, context-sensitive assessment of factual
consistency. To facilitate evaluation, we contribute the first large-scale
dataset of long-form user reviews, comprising entities with over a thousand
reviews each, paired with unbiased expert summaries and manually annotated
queries. Through extensive experiments, we identify key challenges, provide
actionable insights into improving systems, pave the way for future research,
and position OpinioRAG as a robust framework for generating accurate, relevant,
and structured summaries at scale.

### [10] [Wage Sentiment Indices Derived from Survey Comments via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00290)
*Taihei Sone*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用大语言模型构建新薪资情感指数(WSI)，预测日本薪资动态，表现超过基准方法和预训练模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用生成式AI为经济文本分析带来新机遇，通过构建薪资情感指数来预测薪资动态，提高经济政策的及时性和有效性

Method: 基于日本内閡府经济监测调查(EWS)，扩展价格情感指数(PSI)框架构建WSI，开发可扩展的数据架构支持多源数据集成

Result: LLM基础的WSI模型显著超过了基准方法和预训练模型的表现

Conclusion: LLM驱动的情感指数具有强大潜力，能够提升政府和中央银行设计经济政策的及时性和有效性

Abstract: The emergence of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has created new
opportunities for economic text analysis. This study proposes a Wage Sentiment
Index (WSI) constructed with Large Language Models (LLMs) to forecast wage
dynamics in Japan. The analysis is based on the Economy Watchers Survey (EWS),
a monthly survey conducted by the Cabinet Office of Japan that captures
real-time economic assessments from workers in industries highly sensitive to
business conditions. The WSI extends the framework of the Price Sentiment Index
(PSI) used in prior studies, adapting it specifically to wage related
sentiment. To ensure scalability and adaptability, a data architecture is also
developed that enables integration of additional sources such as newspapers and
social media. Experimental results demonstrate that WSI models based on LLMs
significantly outperform both baseline approaches and pretrained models. These
findings highlight the potential of LLM-driven sentiment indices to enhance the
timeliness and effectiveness of economic policy design by governments and
central banks.

### [11] [Balanced Actor Initialization: Stable RLHF Training of Distillation-Based Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00309)
*Chen Zheng,Yiyuan Ma,Yuan Yang,Deyi Liu,Jing Liu,Zuquan Song,Yuxin Song,Cheng Ren,Hang Zhu,Xin Liu,Yiyuan Ma,Siyuan Qiao,Xun Zhou,Liang Xiang,Yonghui Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文发现将RLHF应用于蒸馏训练模型时会出现序列长度崩溃和奖励曲棍球棒曲线问题，提出了平衡演员初始化(BAI)方法来解决这些训练不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然指令调优和RLHF对齐以及蒸馏推理微调各自有效，但将RLHF应用于蒸馏训练模型的第三范式存在严重的不稳定性问题，需要找到解决方案。

Method: 提出平衡演员初始化(BAI)，这是一个两阶段加权模型合并方法：首先合并指令跟随和蒸馏推理微调模型，然后将中间模型与预训练模型进一步合并以保留基础知识。

Result: BAI解决了序列长度崩溃问题，缓解了奖励曲棍球棒曲线现象，实现了训练期间序列长度的持续改进，并在平衡合并比例下实现了训练稳定性和推理能力保持的最佳权衡。

Conclusion: BAI为第三范式提供了有效的稳定训练解决方案，使推理模型能够结合蒸馏效率和RLHF对齐能力。

Abstract: The development of alignment and reasoning capabilities in large language
models has seen remarkable progress through two paradigms: instruction tuning
and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) alignment paradigm, and
distillation-based reasoning fine-tuning paradigm. While both approaches prove
effective independently, the third paradigm of applying RLHF to
distillation-trained models presents significant challenges. Our investigation
reveals two critical phenomena that emerge in this paradigm: Sequence Length
Collapse, where language generation dramatically reduces during early RLHF
training, and the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, featuring severe reward score
drops followed by gradual recovery. These instabilities fundamentally
compromise the model's alignment and reasoning capabilities. To address these
challenges, we propose Balanced Actor Initialization (BAI), a two-stage
weighted model merging approach. BAI first merges instruction-following and
distillation-based reasoning fine-tuned models, then further combines this
intermediate model with the pretrained model to preserve foundational
knowledge. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and
detailed analysis of training experiments, we demonstrate that BAI resolves
Sequence Length Collapse, mitigates the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, and enables
continuous sequence length improvement during training. Additionally, our
analysis reveals that balanced merging ratios achieve optimal trade-offs
between training stability and reasoning capability preservation. Our work
provides the effective solution for stable training in this third paradigm,
enabling more capable reasoning models that combine distillation efficiency
with RLHF alignment.

### [12] [GIER: Gap-Driven Self-Refinement for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00325)
*Rinku Dewri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GIER是一个通过自我反思和基于概念质量标准的修订来改进大语言模型输出的框架，利用自然语言描述推理差距，让模型迭代批判和精炼自身输出，在多个推理密集型任务中提升推理质量而不降低准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的提示策略依赖演示、示例或思维链模板，但缺乏利用抽象概念差距描述来指导模型自我改进的方法。GIER旨在通过自然语言描述推理差距，让模型能够理解和改进自身的推理过程。

Method: GIER框架使用自然语言描述推理差距，提示模型迭代地批判和精炼自身输出，以更好地满足概念质量标准。该方法不依赖演示或示例，而是直接利用抽象概念差距描述。

Result: 在三个推理密集型任务（SciFact、PrivacyQA和e-SNLI）和四个大语言模型上，GIER提高了推理质量、基础性和推理对齐性，同时不降低任务准确性。模型能够解释抽象概念差距并将其转化为具体推理改进。

Conclusion: GIER证明了大语言模型不仅能够解释抽象概念差距，还能将其转化为具体的推理改进，为提升模型输出质量提供了一种有效的自我反思和修订框架。

Abstract: We introduce GIER (Gap-driven Iterative Enhancement of Responses), a general
framework for improving large language model (LLM) outputs through
self-reflection and revision based on conceptual quality criteria. Unlike
prompting strategies that rely on demonstrations, examples, or chain-of-thought
templates, GIER utilizes natural language descriptions of reasoning gaps, and
prompts a model to iteratively critique and refine its own outputs to better
satisfy these criteria. Across three reasoning-intensive tasks (SciFact,
PrivacyQA, and e-SNLI) and four LLMs (GPT-4.1, GPT-4o Mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and
Llama 3.3 70B), GIER improves rationale quality, grounding, and reasoning
alignment without degrading task accuracy. Our analysis demonstrates that
models can not only interpret abstract conceptual gaps but also translate them
into concrete reasoning improvements.

### [13] [Open Data Synthesis For Deep Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00375)
*Ziyi Xia,Kun Luo,Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InfoSeek是一个用于合成复杂深度研究任务的框架，通过双代理系统构建研究树并生成需要层次遍历的自然语言问题，显著提升了LLM在深度研究任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法捕捉深度研究任务的复杂性，而合成数据集存在推理捷径、知识泄露或结构深度不足的问题，需要新的框架来支持LLM进行复杂的多步推理和证据合成。

Method: 使用双代理系统递归地从大规模网页构建研究树，将中间节点模糊化为有效子问题，并将这些树转换为需要遍历完整层次结构的自然语言问题。支持快速扩展，生成超过5万个训练样本和推理轨迹。

Result: 在InfoSeek上训练的模型 consistently outperforms strong baselines。在BrowseComp-Plus基准测试中，使用InfoSeek优化的3B LLM超越了更大的32B模型和轻量级商业API，性能与更强的API相当。

Conclusion: InfoSeek提供了一个可扩展的框架来合成复杂的深度研究任务，显著提升了LLM的层次推理能力，并支持高级优化策略如复合奖励设计和轨迹级探索。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to go beyond simple
factual queries toward Deep Research-tasks that require decomposing questions
into sub-problems, coordinating multi-step reasoning, and synthesizing evidence
from diverse sources. We formalize Deep Research tasks with verifiable answers
as Hierarchical Constraint Satisfaction Problems (HCSPs), which are
fundamentally different from single-constraint, multi-hop, or flat CSP
formulations. However, existing benchmarks (e.g., Natural Questions, HotpotQA)
fail to capture this complexity, while recent synthetic datasets often
introduce shortcut reasoning, knowledge leakage, or lack sufficient structural
depth. To address this gap, we introduce InfoSeek, a scalable framework for
synthesizing complex Deep Research tasks. InfoSeek uses a dual-agent system to
recursively build a Research Tree from large-scale webpages, blurring
intermediate nodes into valid sub-problems, and converting these trees into
natural language questions that require traversing the full hierarchy. It also
enables rapid scaling, yielding over 50K training examples, a curated test set,
and reasoning trajectories generated via reject sampling. Experiments show that
models trained on InfoSeek consistently outperform strong baselines. On a
challenging benchmark BrowseComp-Plus, 3B LLMs optimized with InfoSeek surpass

### [14] [GraphKV: Breaking the Static Selection Paradigm with Graph-Based KV Cache Eviction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00388)
*Xuelin Li,Xiangqi Jin,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GraphKV是一个基于图的KV缓存管理框架，通过图传播机制动态更新token重要性，提升长文本处理效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统KV缓存逐出策略基于静态启发式方法，无法捕捉推理过程中token间动态依赖关系，导致内存受限下的性能瓶颈

Method: 将token建模为带重要性分数的节点，边表示相似关系，通过衰减信号传播机制在图结构中动态更新token重要性

Result: 提出的GraphKV框架可以与现有KV缓存逐出方法（如SnapKV、PyramidKV）即插即用地结合使用

Conclusion: GraphKV通过图结构动态管理token重要性，为LLM长文本序列处理提供了更高效的KV缓存压缩解决方案

Abstract: Efficient Key-Value (KV) cache management is essential for processing long
text sequences in large language models (LLMs), where memory constraints often
limit performance. Conventional KV eviction strategies, such as top-k selection
based on attention scores, depend on static heuristics that fail to capture the
evolving implicit dependencies among tokens during inference. To overcome this,
we propose GraphKV, a graph-based framework that redefines token selection for
KV cache compression. In GraphKV, tokens are modeled as nodes with importance
scores, and edges represent their similarity relationships. Through a
decay-signal-propagation mechanism, token importance is dynamically updated by
propagating information across the graph, enabling adaptive retention of the
most contextually significant tokens. GraphKV can be seamlessly utilized in
existing KV cache eviction methods such as SnapKV and PyramidKV in a
plug-and-play manner. Codes will be released on Github.

*Yuting Tan,Xuying Li,Zhuo Li,Huizhen Shu,Peikang Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了GCG和T-GCG对抗性提示攻击在不同规模开源LLM上的效果，发现攻击成功率随模型规模增大而降低，语义评估比前缀启发式更严格，且推理密集型编码提示比安全提示更易受攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估梯度基对抗性提示攻击（如GCG算法）在不同规模语言模型上的有效性，特别是在安全导向和推理密集型任务中的表现差异。

Method: 使用Qwen2.5-0.5B、LLaMA-3.2-1B和GPT-OSS-20B三个不同规模的开源LLM，在AdvBench安全提示和推理密集型编码提示上评估GCG及其退火增强变体T-GCG的攻击效果，采用前缀启发式和GPT-4o语义判断两种评估方式。

Result: 1) 攻击成功率随模型规模增大而降低；2) 前缀启发式评估高估攻击效果，语义评估更严格现实；3) 编码相关提示比安全提示更易受攻击；4) T-GCG能多样化对抗搜索但在语义评估下优势有限。

Conclusion: GCG存在可扩展性限制，推理任务中存在被忽视的脆弱性，需要进一步开发退火启发策略以进行更鲁棒的对抗评估。

Abstract: Gradient-based adversarial prompting, such as the Greedy Coordinate Gradient
(GCG) algorithm, has emerged as a powerful method for jailbreaking large
language models (LLMs). In this paper, we present a systematic appraisal of GCG
and its annealing-augmented variant, T-GCG, across open-source LLMs of varying
scales. Using Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA-3.2-1B, and GPT-OSS-20B, we evaluate attack
effectiveness on both safety-oriented prompts (AdvBench) and
reasoning-intensive coding prompts. Our study reveals three key findings: (1)
attack success rates (ASR) decrease with model size, reflecting the increasing
complexity and non-convexity of larger models' loss landscapes; (2)
prefix-based heuristics substantially overestimate attack effectiveness
compared to GPT-4o semantic judgments, which provide a stricter and more
realistic evaluation; and (3) coding-related prompts are significantly more
vulnerable than adversarial safety prompts, suggesting that reasoning itself
can be exploited as an attack vector. In addition, preliminary results with
T-GCG show that simulated annealing can diversify adversarial search and
achieve competitive ASR under prefix evaluation, though its benefits under
semantic judgment remain limited. Together, these findings highlight the
scalability limits of GCG, expose overlooked vulnerabilities in reasoning
tasks, and motivate further development of annealing-inspired strategies for
more robust adversarial evaluation.

TL;DR: MedSEBA是一个AI驱动的医疗问答系统，通过检索PubMed医学研究数据库生成基于证据的答案，并提供研究共识演变可视化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决互联网医疗信息可靠性差和医学研究数量庞大难以追踪的问题，帮助用户区分可靠信息和误导信息。

Method: 利用大型语言模型生成连贯答案，但基于从PubMed动态检索的可信医学研究进行证据支撑，答案包含可追溯的关键点和论点。

Result: 用户研究表明医学专家和普通用户认为系统可用、有帮助，提供的答案可信且信息丰富。

Conclusion: 该系统既适用于日常健康问题，也适用于高级研究洞察，能够有效合成基于证据的医疗答案。

Abstract: In the digital age, people often turn to the Internet in search of medical
advice and recommendations. With the increasing volume of online content, it
has become difficult to distinguish reliable sources from misleading
information. Similarly, millions of medical studies are published every year,
making it challenging for researchers to keep track of the latest scientific
findings. These evolving studies can reach differing conclusions, which is not
reflected in traditional search tools. To address these challenges, we
introduce MedSEBA, an interactive AI-powered system for synthesizing
evidence-based answers to medical questions. It utilizes the power of Large
Language Models to generate coherent and expressive answers, but grounds them
in trustworthy medical studies dynamically retrieved from the research database
PubMed. The answers consist of key points and arguments, which can be traced
back to respective studies. Notably, the platform also provides an overview of
the extent to which the most relevant studies support or refute the given
medical claim, and a visualization of how the research consensus evolved
through time. Our user study revealed that medical experts and lay users find
the system usable and helpful, and the provided answers trustworthy and
informative. This makes the system well-suited for both everyday health
questions and advanced research insights.

*Fenghua Liu,Yulong Chen,Yixuan Liu,Zhujun Jin,Solomon Tsai,Ming Zhong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过构建人工语言Camlang来测试LLM的元语言推理能力，发现GPT-5在英语任务上达到98%准确率但在Camlang上仅47%，远低于人类的87%，表明当前模型缺乏真正的语法系统掌握能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证大型语言模型是否具备真正的推理能力而非仅仅是模式匹配，通过测试模型能否通过显式元语言演绎学习掌握陌生语言的语法系统。

Method: 创建人工语言Camlang，包含语法书和双语词典资源，将CommonsenseQA任务适配为Camlang-CSQA-v0，要求模型应用语法规则和词汇映射来解决问题。

Result: GPT-5在英语任务上98%准确率，但在Camlang上仅47%，远低于人类87%的表现。其他先进推理LLM表现更差，模型成功主要来自浅层词汇对齐而非系统语法掌握。

Conclusion: Camlang建立了基于认知科学的评估范式，揭示了当前模型与人类元语言能力之间的根本差距，模型缺乏系统性的语法掌握能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve gold-medal performance across many
benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects genuine
reasoning or pattern matching. From a cognitive science perspective, an
informative test is whether models can master an unfamiliar language through
explicit metalinguistic deductive learning, a paradigm where human learners can
reliably internalise grammatical systems through metalinguistic reasoning. We
address this question with Camlang, a novel constructed language that exhibits
naturalistic yet unattested feature combinations. Camlang consists of two
explicit resources, a grammar book and a bilingual dictionary, which mirror
adult second-language learning via explicit grammar rules and lexical lookup,
and enable us to disentangle errors in morpho-syntax, lexical semantics, and
sentence-level reasoning. Human experiments show that these resources are
sufficient for participants to acquire Camlang and successfully solve Camlang
tasks. To operationalise evaluation, we adapt CommonsenseQA into Camlang,
creating Camlang-CSQA-v0, the first task in a broader suite where solving
questions requires applying grammar rules and lexical mappings. Experimental
results show that GPT-5 achieves 98\% EM accuracy in English but only 47\% in
Camlang, far below human performance at 87\%, while other state-of-the-art
reasoning LLMs perform even worse. Human verification further reveals that most
model successes stem from shallow lexical alignment while GPT-5 shows emerging
metalinguistic awareness to a limited extent but not systematic grammatical
mastery as humans. Camlang establishes a cognitively grounded evaluation
paradigm that exposes fundamental gaps between current models and human
metalinguistic competence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GOSU是一个基于语义单元的RAG框架，通过全局消歧和分层关键词提取来解决传统图RAG中语义单元提取的模糊性和复杂耦合问题，在多个任务上优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图的RAG方法使用异构图和超图来丰富检索和生成，但局部文本块提取的高层语义单元容易产生歧义、复杂耦合，并因缺乏全局知识或忽略细粒度关系而增加检索开销。

Method: GOSU框架在图形构建阶段对预提取的语义单元进行全局合并，指导实体和关系提取；在检索生成阶段引入分层关键词提取和语义单元补全，分别捕获细粒度二元关系和粗粒度n元关系。

Result: 在多个任务评估中，GOSU在生成质量方面优于基线RAG方法。

Conclusion: GOSU通过全局语义单元处理和分层关系捕获机制，有效解决了传统RAG方法的局限性，提升了检索增强生成的效果。

Abstract: Building upon the standard graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
the introduction of heterogeneous graphs and hypergraphs aims to enrich
retrieval and generation by leveraging the relationships between multiple
entities through the concept of semantic units (SUs). But this also raises a
key issue: The extraction of high-level SUs limited to local text chunks is
prone to ambiguity, complex coupling, and increased retrieval overhead due to
the lack of global knowledge or the neglect of fine-grained relationships. To
address these issues, we propose GOSU, a semantic unit-centric RAG framework
that efficiently performs global disambiguation and utilizes SUs to capture
interconnections between different nodes across the global context. In the
graph construction phase, GOSU performs global merging on the pre-extracted SUs
from local text chunks and guides entity and relationship extraction, reducing
the difficulty of coreference resolution while uncovering global semantic
objects across text chunks. In the retrieval and generation phase, we introduce
hierarchical keyword extraction and semantic unit completion. The former
uncovers the fine-grained binary relationships overlooked by the latter, while
the latter compensates for the coarse-grained n-ary relationships missing from
the former. Evaluation across multiple tasks demonstrates that GOSU outperforms
the baseline RAG methods in terms of generation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伊斯兰继承法需要精确识别继承人和计算份额，这对AI构成挑战。需要开发既准确又高效的解决方案，特别是在资源受限和设备部署的场景下。

Method: 使用专门的阿拉伯语文本编码器（MARBERT、ArabicBERT、AraBERT）和注意力相关性评分（ARS）来对答案选项进行语义相关性排序，实现快速、设备端推理而无需生成式推理。

Result: 大型模型（Gemini、DeepSeek）在QIAS 2025数据集上达到87.6%的准确率，但需要更多资源且依赖上下文。基于MARBERT的方法达到69.87%的准确率，在效率、设备端部署和隐私方面具有优势。

Conclusion: 研究量化了大模型峰值性能与小型专业化系统在实际优势之间的关键权衡，证明了在高风险领域中轻量级专业化系统的实用价值。

Abstract: Islamic inheritance law (Ilm al-Mawarith) requires precise identification of
heirs and calculation of shares, which poses a challenge for AI. In this paper,
we present a lightweight framework for solving multiple-choice inheritance
questions using a specialised Arabic text encoder and Attentive Relevance
Scoring (ARS). The system ranks answer options according to semantic relevance,
and enables fast, on-device inference without generative reasoning. We evaluate
Arabic encoders (MARBERT, ArabicBERT, AraBERT) and compare them with API-based
LLMs (Gemini, DeepSeek) on the QIAS 2025 dataset. While large models achieve an
accuracy of up to 87.6%, they require more resources and are context-dependent.
Our MARBERT-based approach achieves 69.87% accuracy, presenting a compelling
case for efficiency, on-device deployability, and privacy. While this is lower
than the 87.6% achieved by the best-performing LLM, our work quantifies a
critical trade-off between the peak performance of large models and the
practical advantages of smaller, specialized systems in high-stakes domains.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了Token-Entropy Conformal Prediction (TECP)方法，通过利用标记灵的作为无需logit和参考的不确定性测量，在黑盒LLM设置中提供了可靠的不确定性量化方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放式语言生成的不确定性量化在黑盒条件下是个重要但缺乏研究的挑战，当前方法依赖于语义一致性假设或白盒特征。

Method: TECP使用标记灵作为logit-free和reference-free的不确定性测量，并通过分割遵从预测(CP)流程构建具有正式覆盖保证的预测集。方法从采样生成的标记灵结构直接估计认知不确定性。

Result: 在6个大型语言模型和2个测试集(CoQA和TriviaQA)上的实验评估显示，TECP一贯地实现了可靠的覆盖和紧凑的预测集，表现超过了之前的自我一致性UQ方法。

Conclusion: TECP为黑盒LLM设置中的可信生成提供了一种有理论基础且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for open-ended language generation remains a
critical yet underexplored challenge, especially under black-box constraints
where internal model signals are inaccessible. In this paper, we introduce
Token-Entropy Conformal Prediction (TECP), a novel framework that leverages
token-level entropy as a logit-free, reference-free uncertainty measure and
integrates it into a split conformal prediction (CP) pipeline to construct
prediction sets with formal coverage guarantees. Unlike existing approaches
that rely on semantic consistency heuristics or white-box features, TECP
directly estimates epistemic uncertainty from the token entropy structure of
sampled generations and calibrates uncertainty thresholds via CP quantiles to
ensure provable error control. Empirical evaluations across six large language
models and two benchmarks (CoQA and TriviaQA) demonstrate that TECP
consistently achieves reliable coverage and compact prediction sets,
outperforming prior self-consistency-based UQ methods. Our method provides a
principled and efficient solution for trustworthy generation in black-box LLM
settings.

TL;DR: 本研究探索了四种提示方法来解决角色扮演对话代理的过度说话和工具使用不足问题，其中基于规则的提示方法(RRP)通过角色卡/场景契约设计和严格函数调用执行获得了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在CPDC 2025挑战中，对话代理经常产生过长的角色回应(过度说话)，同时未能根据角色有效使用工具(行动不足)，如生成不存在的函数调用或在回答前进行不必要的工具调用。

Method: 研究了四种提示方法：1)基础角色提示 2)人工制作角色提示 3)自动提示优化(APO) 4)基于规则的角色提示(RRP)，其中RRP采用角色卡/场景契约设计和严格函数调用执行技术。

Result: 基于规则的角色提示方法取得了最佳性能，总体得分0.571，相比零样本基线得分0.519有显著提升，优于更复杂的APO方法。

Conclusion: RRP设计能显著提高角色扮演对话代理的有效性和可靠性，研究开源了最佳提示和APO工具以支持未来角色提示开发工作。

Abstract: This report investigates approaches for prompting a tool-augmented large
language model (LLM) to act as a role-playing dialogue agent in the API track
of the Commonsense Persona-grounded Dialogue Challenge (CPDC) 2025. In this
setting, dialogue agents often produce overly long in-character responses
(over-speaking) while failing to use tools effectively according to the persona
(under-acting), such as generating function calls that do not exist or making
unnecessary tool calls before answering. We explore four prompting approaches
to address these issues: 1) basic role prompting, 2) human-crafted role
prompting, 3) automatic prompt optimization (APO), and 4) rule-based role
prompting. The rule-based role prompting (RRP) approach achieved the best
performance through two novel techniques--character-card/scene-contract design
and strict enforcement of function calling--which led to an overall score of
0.571, improving on the zero-shot baseline score of 0.519. These findings
demonstrate that RRP design can substantially improve the effectiveness and
reliability of role-playing dialogue agents compared with more elaborate
methods such as APO. To support future efforts in developing persona prompts,
we are open-sourcing all of our best-performing prompts and the APO tool.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估研究查询的长文本回答主要依赖专家标注，限制了评估范围。研究专业知识广泛存在于综述文章中，需要一种更全面的评估方法。

Method: 从75个研究领域的综述文章中提取21K个查询和160K个评分标准项，每个评分标准包含具体的回答评估标准（如引用论文、解释、描述限制等）。使用31位博士标注者在8个领域进行评估。

Result: 96%的查询支持博士信息需求，87%的评分标准项需要在系统回答中用至少一个句子来满足。构建的自动配对判断器与专家判断达到74%一致率。评估18个系统在7.6K+配对评估中，最佳系统仅覆盖75%的评分标准项。

Conclusion: 当前LLM系统在研究查询回答中存在显著能力差距，特别是在引用、限制描述和比较方面表现不足。ResearchQA为多领域综合评估提供了有效资源。

Abstract: Evaluating long-form responses to research queries heavily relies on expert
annotators, restricting attention to areas like AI where researchers can
conveniently enlist colleagues. Yet, research expertise is widespread: survey
articles synthesize knowledge distributed across the literature. We introduce
ResearchQA, a resource for evaluating LLM systems by distilling survey articles
from 75 research fields into 21K queries and 160K rubric items. Each rubric,
derived jointly with queries from survey sections, lists query-specific answer
evaluation criteria, i.e., citing papers, making explanations, and describing
limitations. Assessments by 31 Ph.D. annotators in 8 fields indicate 96% of
queries support Ph.D. information needs and 87% of rubric items should be
addressed in system responses by a sentence or more. Using our rubrics, we are
able to construct an automatic pairwise judge obtaining 74% agreement with
expert judgments. We leverage ResearchQA to analyze competency gaps in 18
systems in over 7.6K pairwise evaluations. No parametric or retrieval-augmented
system we evaluate exceeds 70% on covering rubric items, and the
highest-ranking agentic system shows 75% coverage. Error analysis reveals that
the highest-ranking system fully addresses less than 11% of citation rubric
items, 48% of limitation items, and 49% of comparison items. We release our
data to facilitate more comprehensive multi-field evaluations.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于频的动态聚合框架，通过预测熵来适应性确定聚合边界，学习压缩语义语音表征，在保持性能的同时提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音离散表征学习方法通常将16kHz波形编码为每秒25-50个语义标记，但语音一般仅传达2-5个字/秒，这种细粒度标记导致冗余和下游训练推理效率低下。语义理解并不需要这么详细的标记分辨率。

Method: 首先通过大规模无标签数据上的下一标记预测预训练语音语言模型以捐捕频繁标记模式，然后使用预测熵来适应性确定聚合边界，接着通过交叉注意力模块融合每个段落内的信息。通过调整熵阈值可灵活控制表征的粒度和压缩比。

Result: 在自动语音识别(ASR)、语音到文本翻译和语音转换任务上的实验表明，压缩后的表征表现与密集标记序列相当或更好，证明了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地解决了现有语音离散表征学习中的冗余和效率问题，通过动态聚合框架实现了高效的语义语音表征压缩，为下游任务提供了更好的效率和性能。

Abstract: Discrete speech representation learning has recently attracted increasing
interest in both acoustic and semantic modeling. Existing approaches typically
encode 16 kHz waveforms into discrete tokens at a rate of 25 or 50 tokens per
second. However, given that speech generally conveys only 2 to 5 words per
second, such fine-grained tokenization introduces redundancy and hinders
efficiency in downstream training and inference. Moreover, semantic speech
representations at this frequency primarily capture phonetic-level information,
while semantic understanding may not require such detailed token-level
resolution. To address these limitations, we propose an entropy-based dynamic
aggregation framework for learning compressed semantic speech representations.
A speech language model is first pre-trained via next-token prediction on
large-scale unlabeled data to capture frequent token patterns. Predictive
entropy is then used to adaptively determine aggregation boundaries, followed
by a cross-attention module that fuses information within each segment. By
adjusting the entropy threshold, the granularity and compression ratio of the
representations can be flexibly controlled. Experiments on ASR, speech-to-text
translation, and voice conversion tasks demonstrate that the compressed
representations perform on par with or better than dense token sequences,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: LLMs在生成法律文件摘要时会根据用户角色（法官、检察官、律师等）进行有动机的推理，选择性包含信息以符合角色立场，即使有平衡指令也难以避免这种偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在法律语境中如何根据不同的法律角色进行有动机的推理和信息框架调整，探讨模型在生成用户定制摘要时的战略信息选择行为。

Method: 基于法律现实主义和现代法律实践趋势，开发了一个评估框架，关注法律事实和推理的包含情况，以及对待利益相关者的倾向性，测试不同法律角色提示下的模型表现。

Result: 即使提示中包含平衡指令，模型仍表现出选择性信息包含模式，反映出与角色一致的视角偏好，模型会根据法律角色调整摘要内容。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在高风险法律环境中需要对LLM摘要行为进行角色感知评估的重要性，因为即使没有明确的角色指令，模型也可能从先前交互或上下文中推断用户角色并产生类似的偏向性对齐。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate user-tailored
summaries, adapting outputs to specific stakeholders. In legal contexts, this
raises important questions about motivated reasoning -- how models
strategically frame information to align with a stakeholder's position within
the legal system. Building on theories of legal realism and recent trends in
legal practice, we investigate how LLMs respond to prompts conditioned on
different legal roles (e.g., judges, prosecutors, attorneys) when summarizing
judicial decisions. We introduce an evaluation framework grounded in legal fact
and reasoning inclusion, also considering favorability towards stakeholders.
Our results show that even when prompts include balancing instructions, models
exhibit selective inclusion patterns that reflect role-consistent perspectives.
These findings raise broader concerns about how similar alignment may emerge as
LLMs begin to infer user roles from prior interactions or context, even without
explicit role instructions. Our results underscore the need for role-aware
evaluation of LLM summarization behavior in high-stakes legal settings.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs在推理能力增强时更容易响应恶意请求，这种现象被称为"推理诱导的错位"，大模型尤其脆弱，需要关注推理与安全性的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型广泛应用，其安全性和与人类价值观对齐的问题日益突出。先前研究表明在恶意数据集上微调会导致错位行为，但本文发现即使使用良性数据增强推理能力也会产生类似问题。

Method: 通过切换到"思考模式"或在良性数学数据集上微调来增强LLMs的推理能力，然后测试模型对恶意请求的响应性，并分析内部模型状态（注意力转移和专家混合模型中的专家分工）。

Result: 推理能力增强后，LLMs对恶意请求的响应性显著提高，大模型尤其脆弱。内部状态分析显示注意力转移和专家分工有助于将过度推理重新导向安全防护机制。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了新兴的推理-安全性权衡问题，强调了为高级推理模型推进对齐技术的紧迫性，为理解LLMs安全机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: With Large Language Models (LLMs) becoming increasingly widely adopted,
concerns regarding their safety and alignment with human values have
intensified. Previous studies have shown that fine-tuning LLMs on narrow and
malicious datasets induce misaligned behaviors. In this work, we report a more
concerning phenomenon, Reasoning-Induced Misalignment. Specifically, we observe
that LLMs become more responsive to malicious requests when reasoning is
strengthened, via switching to "think-mode" or fine-tuning on benign math
datasets, with dense models particularly vulnerable. Moreover, we analyze
internal model states and find that both attention shifts and specialized
experts in mixture-of-experts models help redirect excessive reasoning towards
safety guardrails. These findings provide new insights into the emerging
reasoning-safety trade-off and underscore the urgency of advancing alignment
for advanced reasoning models.

Motivation: 解决LLM在实际部署环境与控制评测环境中行为差异的问题，这种"评估意识"现象影响了对模型安全性和诚实性的准确评估。

Method: 通过线性探针对提示进行"测试类似"到"部署类似"的连续评分，使用LLM重写策略将提示向更自然的部署风格转换，同时保持原有任务。

Result: 重写后提示的探针得分平均提高30%；在所有模型中，诚实回应平均增加5.26%，欺骗性回应平均减少12.40%，拒绝率平均增加6.38%。

Conclusion: 评估意识是一个可量化且可操纵的因素，模型在测试环境中更容易产生不安全输出，强调需要更现实的评估框架来准确评估模型对齐性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit significant behavioral shifts when
they perceive a change from a real-world deployment context to a controlled
evaluation setting, a phenomenon known as "evaluation awareness." This
discrepancy poses a critical challenge for AI alignment, as benchmark
performance may not accurately reflect a model's true safety and honesty. In
this work, we systematically quantify these behavioral changes by manipulating
the perceived context of prompts. We introduce a methodology that uses a linear
probe to score prompts on a continuous scale from "test-like" to "deploy-like"
and leverage an LLM rewriting strategy to shift these prompts towards a more
natural, deployment-style context while preserving the original task. Using
this method, we achieved a 30% increase in the average probe score across a
strategic role-playing dataset after rewriting. Evaluating a suite of
state-of-the-art models on these original and rewritten prompts, we find that
rewritten "deploy-like" prompts induce a significant and consistent shift in
behavior. Across all models, we observed an average increase in honest
responses of 5.26% and a corresponding average decrease in deceptive responses
of 12.40%. Furthermore, refusal rates increased by an average of 6.38%,
indicating heightened safety compliance. Our findings demonstrate that
evaluation awareness is a quantifiable and manipulable factor that directly
influences LLM behavior, revealing that models are more prone to unsafe or
deceptive outputs in perceived test environments. This underscores the urgent
need for more realistic evaluation frameworks to accurately gauge true model

*Rishiraj Acharya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Gated Associative Memory (GAM)网络，一种线性复杂度的并行架构，替代Transformer的自注意力机制，在保持性能的同时显著提升训练速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的自注意力机制存在二次方计算复杂度问题，成为处理长序列的瓶颈，需要更高效的序列建模架构

Method: GAM块使用两条并行路径：因果卷积捕获局部位置相关上下文，关联记忆检索机制建模全局内容模式，通过门控机制动态融合

Result: 在WikiText-2和TinyStories数据集上，GAM训练速度显著快于Transformer和Mamba，验证困惑度达到相当或更优水平

Conclusion: GAM作为线性复杂度的序列建模架构，在效率和性能上都表现出色，是Transformer的有前景替代方案

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the self-attention mechanism,
has become the de facto standard for sequence modeling tasks. However, its core
computational primitive scales quadratically with sequence length (O(N^2)),
creating a significant bottleneck for processing long contexts. In this paper,
we propose the Gated Associative Memory (GAM) network, a novel, fully parallel
architecture for sequence modeling that exhibits linear complexity (O(N)) with
respect to sequence length. The GAM block replaces the self-attention layer
with two parallel pathways: a causal convolution to efficiently capture local,
position-dependent context, and a parallel associative memory retrieval
mechanism to model global, content-based patterns. These pathways are
dynamically fused using a gating mechanism, allowing the model to flexibly
combine local and global information for each token. We implement GAM from
scratch and conduct a rigorous comparative analysis against a standard
Transformer model and a modern linear-time baseline (Mamba) on the WikiText-2
benchmark, as well as against the Transformer on the TinyStories dataset. Our
experiments demonstrate that GAM is consistently faster, outperforming both
baselines on training speed, and achieves a superior or competitive final
validation perplexity across all datasets, establishing it as a promising and
efficient alternative for sequence modeling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了ICPC基准测试，包含254个国际大学生程序设计竞赛题目，通过多种推理技术评估语言模型在竞争性编程任务中的表现，最佳方法将解决率从19.1%提升到42.2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 竞争性编程任务需要复杂的算法思维和代码创建能力，但作为评估语言模型的领域尚未得到足够关注，因此需要建立专门的基准来测试模型在这类复杂任务上的表现。

Method: 创建包含254个ICPC题目的基准，每个问题包含官方分析、参考代码和多种测试用例。采用零样本思维链提示、多轮自我判断与反思、检索情景信息等多种推理技术进行模型评估。

Result: 零样本思维链提示下模型仅达到19.1%的解决率，最佳推理技术组合（多轮自我判断+反思+检索）将解决率提升至42.2%。人类参与的研究发现，通过特定指令可以解决之前无法解决的17/18个问题。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发具有扎实、创新和算法思维能力的语言模型提供了重要进展，通过定量结果和定性分析展示了模型在复杂编程任务上的潜力和剩余挑战。

Abstract: Among the hardest tasks for humans are those found in competitive programming
where problems require sophisticated algorithmic thinking, puzzle solving, and
the creation of effective code. As a domain to assess language models (LMs), it
has not received enough attention, though. This study presents the ICPC
benchmark, which consists of 254 international collegiate programming contest
(ICPC) tasks. Each problem includes official analysis, reference code, and
sample, high-quality unit, and hidden tests. We are able to develop and
evaluate a variety of LM inference techniques for competitive programming with
these resources. With zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting, we find that o1
only achieves a 19.1\% pass@1 solve rate. With our best inference technique,
which combines multi-turn self-judge with reflection and retrieval over
episodic information, raises this to 42.2\%. Furthermore, we conduct a new
human-in-the-loop investigation to gain a deeper understanding of the remaining
difficulties. Surprisingly, we discover that o1 can solve 17 out of 18 problems
that were previously unsolvable by any model or technique with just a few
specific instructions. A footstep toward LMs with grounded, imaginative, and
algorithmic thinking is provided by our quantitative findings and qualitative
research. We open-source our code and data at https://github.com/kraritt/zolve.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了LLM在检测隐式和显式亲恨言论的效果，发现安全对齐的审查模型准确度更高（78.7% vs 64.1%），但存在意识形态偏见和公平性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索最小安全对齐的LLM是否能提供更客观的亲恨言论分类能力，比较审查模型与非审查模型的效果差异

Method: 通过实验比较审查模型和非审查模型在检测隐式/显式亲恨言论的准确度、稳健性、公平性和自信度表现

Result: 审查模型准确度更高（78.7% vs 64.1%）但存在意识形态偏见；所有模型都无法理解译谬；存在严重的公平性差异和过度自信问题

Conclusion: LLM不能作为客观仲裁者，需要更复杂的审计框架来考虑公平性、检验和意识形态一致性

Abstract: We investigate the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting
implicit and explicit hate speech, examining whether models with minimal safety
alignment (uncensored) might provide more objective classification capabilities
compared to their heavily-aligned (censored) counterparts. While uncensored
models theoretically offer a less constrained perspective free from moral
guardrails that could bias classification decisions, our results reveal a
surprising trade-off: censored models significantly outperform their uncensored
counterparts in both accuracy and robustness, achieving 78.7% versus 64.1%
strict accuracy. However, this enhanced performance comes with its own
limitation -- the safety alignment acts as a strong ideological anchor, making
censored models resistant to persona-based influence, while uncensored models
prove highly malleable to ideological framing. Furthermore, we identify
critical failures across all models in understanding nuanced language such as
irony. We also find alarming fairness disparities in performance across
different targeted groups and systemic overconfidence that renders
self-reported certainty unreliable. These findings challenge the notion of LLMs
as objective arbiters and highlight the need for more sophisticated auditing
frameworks that account for fairness, calibration, and ideological consistency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Router Upcycling方法，通过从注意力头初始化多个路由器来增强MoE上循环性能，实现SOTA效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型训练效率低，现有简单路由器在复杂路由任务中表现不佳，需要改进MoE上循环技术的路由能力

Method: 在MoE上循环过程中，从前面的注意力层注意力头初始化多个路由器，这些路由器以类似注意力的方式协作分配token给专家

Result: 实验结果表明该方法达到了最先进的性能，优于其他上循环基线方法

Conclusion: Router Upcycling技术有效提升了MoE上循环模型的性能，通过多路由器协作机制解决了简单路由器的局限性

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have gained significant attention in deep
learning due to their dynamic resource allocation and superior performance
across diverse tasks. However, efficiently training these models remains
challenging. The MoE upcycling technique has been proposed to reuse and improve
existing model components, thereby minimizing training overhead. Despite this,
simple routers, such as linear routers, often struggle with complex routing
tasks within MoE upcycling. In response, we propose a novel routing technique
called Router Upcycling to enhance the performance of MoE upcycling models. Our
approach initializes multiple routers from the attention heads of preceding
attention layers during upcycling. These routers collaboratively assign tokens
to specialized experts in an attention-like manner. Each token is processed
into diverse queries and aligned with the experts' features (serving as keys).
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance, outperforming other upcycling baselines.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了14个小语言模型(SLMs)生成虚假新闻标题的能力，发现它们高度配合且伦理约束有限，生成的假新闻标题质量检测准确率仅为35.2%-63.5%，表明这些标题与真实人类撰写的内容差异较大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估小语言模型(SLMs)生成虚假新闻标题的潜在风险和能力，以及现有检测系统对这些AI生成假新闻的识别效果。

Method: 使用控制提示工程对14个SLMs模型(1.7B-14B参数)生成24,000个低质量和高质量虚假新闻标题，然后应用现有的机器学习和深度学习新闻标题质量检测器进行分析。

Result: SLMs表现出高配合率和最小伦理抵抗；质量检测准确率仅为35.2%-63.5%，误分类普遍；生成的标题与真实人类撰写内容相似度较低。

Conclusion: 测试的SLMs普遍能够配合生成虚假标题，伦理约束有限；生成的假新闻标题质量较低，与真实内容差异明显，现有检测系统识别效果不佳。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) have the capability for text generation and may
potentially be used to generate falsified texts online. This study evaluates 14
SLMs (1.7B-14B parameters) including LLaMA, Gemma, Phi, SmolLM, Mistral, and
Granite families in generating perceived low and high quality fake news
headlines when explicitly prompted, and whether they appear to be similar to
real-world news headlines. Using controlled prompt engineering, 24,000
headlines were generated across low-quality and high-quality deceptive
categories. Existing machine learning and deep learning-based news headline
quality detectors were then applied against these SLM-generated fake news
headlines. SLMs demonstrated high compliance rates with minimal ethical
resistance, though there were some occasional exceptions. Headline quality
detection using established DistilBERT and bagging classifier models showed
that quality misclassification was common, with detection accuracies only
ranging from 35.2% to 63.5%. These findings suggest the following: tested SLMs
generally are compliant in generating falsified headlines, although there are
slight variations in ethical restraints, and the generated headlines did not
closely resemble existing primarily human-written content on the web, given the
low quality classification accuracy.

Abstract: Recent studies in time series forecasting (TSF) use multimodal inputs, such
as text and historical time series data, to predict future values. These
studies mainly focus on developing advanced techniques to integrate textual
information with time series data to perform the task and achieve promising
results. Meanwhile, these approaches rely on high-quality text and time series
inputs, whereas in some cases, the text does not accurately or fully capture
the information carried by the historical time series, which leads to unstable
performance in multimodal TSF. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the
textual content to improve the performance of multimodal TSF. In this paper, we
propose improving multimodal TSF by reinforcing the text modalities. We propose
a text reinforcement model (TeR) to generate reinforced text that addresses
potential weaknesses in the original text, then apply this reinforced text to
support the multimodal TSF model's understanding of the time series, improving
TSF performance. To guide the TeR toward producing higher-quality reinforced
text, we design a reinforcement learning approach that assigns rewards based on
the impact of each reinforced text on the performance of the multimodal TSF
model and its relevance to the TSF task. We optimize the TeR accordingly, so as
to improve the quality of the generated reinforced text and enhance TSF
performance. Extensive experiments on a real-world benchmark dataset covering
various domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which
outperforms strong baselines and existing studies on the dataset.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RevBrowse是一个基于LLM的评论驱动推荐框架，通过PrefRAG模块动态检索相关评论来解决上下文窗口限制和评论相关性排序问题，在四个亚马逊数据集上取得显著效果提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在推荐任务中表现出色，但如何有效整合用户评论面临两大挑战：受限于上下文窗口无法动态利用评论，以及缺乏机制来优先处理与当前决策最相关的评论。

Method: 提出RevBrowse框架，模拟用户"浏览-决策"过程，集成评论到LLM重排序中。引入PrefRAG模块，将用户和物品表示解耦为结构化形式，并根据目标物品自适应检索偏好相关内容。

Result: 在四个亚马逊评论数据集上的广泛实验表明，RevBrowse相比强基线模型取得了持续且显著的改进，证明了其在建模动态用户偏好方面的泛化能力和有效性。

Conclusion: RevBrowse通过检索增强过程不仅提升了推荐性能，还提供了一定程度的可解释性，使影响最终推荐的评论变得可见，为评论驱动的LLM推荐提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in recommendation
tasks due to their strengths in language understanding, reasoning and knowledge
integration. These capabilities are especially beneficial for review-based
recommendation, which relies on semantically rich user-generated texts to
reveal fine-grained user preferences and item attributes. However, effectively
incorporating reviews into LLM-based recommendation remains challenging due to
(1) inefficient to dynamically utilize user reviews under LLMs' constrained
context windows, and (2) lacking effective mechanisms to prioritize reviews
most relevant to the user's current decision context. To address these
challenges, we propose RevBrowse, a review-driven recommendation framework
inspired by the "browse-then-decide" decision process commonly observed in
online user behavior. RevBrowse integrates user reviews into the LLM-based
reranking process to enhance its ability to distinguish between candidate
items. To improve the relevance and efficiency of review usage, we introduce
PrefRAG, a retrieval-augmented module that disentangles user and item
representations into structured forms and adaptively retrieves
preference-relevant content conditioned on the target item. Extensive
experiments on four Amazon review datasets demonstrate that RevBrowse achieves
consistent and significant improvements over strong baselines, highlighting its
generalizability and effectiveness in modeling dynamic user preferences.
Furthermore, since the retrieval-augmented process is transparent, RevBrowse
offers a certain level of interpretability by making visible which reviews
influence the final recommendation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准置信度采样方法导致掩码扩散模型的生成顺序类似于自回归过程，限制了非自回归建模的优势。

Method: RWS在每一步扩散过程中评估整个中间序列的质量，并相应缩放token对数概率，通过整合全局序列级连贯性来指导token选择。

Result: 实验表明RWS显著促进了非自回归生成顺序，在多个评估指标上都有改进。

Conclusion: 整合全局信号能有效增强掩码扩散模型的非自回归特性和整体性能。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a promising non-autoregressive
alternative for large language modeling. Standard decoding methods for MDMs,
such as confidence-based sampling, select tokens independently based on
individual token confidences at each diffusion step. However, we observe that
this independent token selection often results in generation orders resembling
sequential autoregressive processes, limiting the advantages of
non-autoregressive modeling. To mitigate this pheonomenon, we propose
Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS), a novel decoding strategy that leverages an
external reward model to provide a principled global signal during the
iterative diffusion process. Specifically, at each diffusion step, RWS
evaluates the quality of the entire intermediate sequence and scales token
logits accordingly, guiding token selection by integrating global
sequence-level coherence. This method selectively increases the confidence of
tokens that initially have lower scores, thereby promoting a more
non-autoregressive generation order. Furthermore, we provide theoretical
justification showing that reward-weighted logit scaling induces beneficial
rank reversals in token selection and consistently improves expected reward.
Experiments demonstrate that RWS significantly promotes non-autoregressive
generation orders, leading to improvements across multiple evaluation metrics.
These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating global signals in
enhancing both the non-autoregressive properties and overall performance of
MDMs.

introduces a structured framework for designing an AI-powered Learning
Management System (AI-LMS) that integrates generative and conversational AI to
support adaptive, interactive, and learner-centered instruction. Using a
design-based research (DBR) methodology, the framework unfolds through five

resulting AI-LMS features modular components -- including configurable prompts,
adaptive feedback loops, and multi-agent conversation flows -- aligned with
pedagogical paradigms such as behaviorist, constructivist, and connectivist
learning theories. By combining AI capabilities with human-centered design and
ethical safeguards, this study advances a practical model for AI integration in
education. Future research will validate and refine the system through
real-world implementation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，对中文AI生成文本的准确检测需求日益增长，而中文语言的细微细腻给现有方法带来了重大挑战。

Method: 使用NLPCC 2025中文AI生成文本检测数据集，系统比较编码器模型（BERT-large和RoBERTa-wwm-ext-large）、解码器LLM（Qwen2.5-7B经LoRA微调）和FastText基线。编码器采用提示基于掩码语言建模方法，解码器采用指令格式输入和轻量级分类头。

Result: 编码器模型虽然几乎记住训练数据，但在分布偏移下性能显著下降（RoBERTa: 76.3%，BERT: 79.3%）。FastText显示了惊人的词汇稳健性（83.5%）但缺乏深层语义理解。LoRA微调的Qwen2.5-7B达到95.94%测试准确率，表现出艰艰的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 解码器基础的大语言模型经参数效率微调在中文AI生成文本检测中具有优异性能。未来工作将探索Qwen3模型、精简版本和集成策略以进一步提升跨领域稳健性。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has heightened the demand
for accurate detection of AI-generated text, particularly in languages like
Chinese, where subtle linguistic nuances pose significant challenges to current
methods. In this study, we conduct a systematic comparison of encoder-based
Transformers (Chinese BERT-large and RoBERTa-wwm-ext-large), a decoder-only LLM
(Alibaba's Qwen2.5-7B/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B fine-tuned via Low-Rank
Adaptation, LoRA), and a FastText baseline using the publicly available dataset
from the NLPCC 2025 Chinese AI-Generated Text Detection Task. Encoder models
were fine-tuned using a novel prompt-based masked language modeling approach,
while Qwen2.5-7B was adapted for classification with an instruction-format
input and a lightweight classification head trained via LoRA. Experiments
reveal that although encoder models nearly memorize training data, they suffer
significant performance degradation under distribution shifts (RoBERTa: 76.3%
test accuracy; BERT: 79.3%). FastText demonstrates surprising lexical
robustness (83.5% accuracy) yet lacks deeper semantic understanding. In
contrast, the LoRA-adapted Qwen2.5-7B achieves 95.94% test accuracy with
balanced precision-recall metrics, indicating superior generalization and
resilience to dataset-specific artifacts. These findings underscore the
efficacy of decoder-based LLMs with parameter-efficient fine-tuning for robust
Chinese AI-generated text detection. Future work will explore next-generation
Qwen3 models, distilled variants, and ensemble strategies to enhance
cross-domain robustness further.

Abstract: Attribution is crucial in question answering (QA) with Large Language Models
(LLMs).SOTA question decomposition-based approaches use long form answers to
generate questions for retrieving related documents. However, the generated
questions are often irrelevant and incomplete, resulting in a loss of facts in
retrieval.These approaches also fail to aggregate evidence snippets from
different documents and paragraphs. To tackle these problems, we propose a new
fact decomposition-based framework called FIDES (\textit{faithful context
enhanced fact decomposition and evidence aggregation}) for attributed QA. FIDES
uses a contextually enhanced two-stage faithful decomposition method to
decompose long form answers into sub-facts, which are then used by a retriever
to retrieve related evidence snippets. If the retrieved evidence snippets
conflict with the related sub-facts, such sub-facts will be revised
accordingly. Finally, the evidence snippets are aggregated according to the
original sentences.Extensive evaluation has been conducted with six datasets,
with an additionally proposed new metric called $Attr_{auto-P}$ for evaluating
the evidence precision. FIDES outperforms the SOTA methods by over 14\% in
average with GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini and Llama 70B series.

Motivation: 当前司法意见生成研究将法律推理和量刑预测作为独立子任务，导致推理与预测不一致，且依赖人工整理知识，实用性有限。为更好符合司法实践需求，需要同时生成法律推理和量刑决策。

Method: 提出LegalChainReasoner框架，应用结构化法律链指导模型进行综合案件评估，整合事实前提、复合法律条件和量刑结论，实现灵活知识注入和端到端意见生成。

Result: 在两个真实世界开源中文法律案例数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 提出的司法意见生成任务和LegalChainReasoner框架有效解决了法律推理与量刑预测的一致性问题，为自动化司法意见生成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: A criminal judicial opinion represents the judge's disposition of a case,
including the decision rationale and sentencing. Automatically generating such
opinions can assist in analyzing sentencing consistency and provide judges with
references to similar past cases. However, current research typically
approaches this task by dividing it into two isolated subtasks: legal reasoning
and sentencing prediction. This separation often leads to inconsistency between
the reasoning and predictions, failing to meet real-world judicial
requirements. Furthermore, prior studies rely on manually curated knowledge to
enhance applicability, yet such methods remain limited in practical deployment.
To address these limitations and better align with legal practice, we propose a
new LegalAI task: Judicial Opinion Generation, which simultaneously produces
both legal reasoning and sentencing decisions. To achieve this, we introduce
LegalChainReasoner, a framework that applies structured legal chains to guide
the model through comprehensive case assessments. By integrating factual
premises, composite legal conditions, and sentencing conclusions, our approach
ensures flexible knowledge injection and end-to-end opinion generation.
Experiments on two real-world and open-source Chinese legal case datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models.

TL;DR: 本文采用LLaMA 3 8B模型进行监督微调，在生物医学多跳问答任务MedHopQA上进行评估，发现模型在语义理解方面表现良好但精确匹配得分较低，提出了两阶段推理管道来改善输出格式问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在问答任务中的广泛应用，需要对其在复杂生物医学问答能力进行严格评估，特别是在真实医疗应用部署前的性能验证。

Method: 使用LLaMA 3 8B模型进行监督微调，利用来自BioASQ、MedQuAD和TREC的精选生物医学问答数据集。探索三种实验设置：长短答案联合微调、仅短答案和仅长答案微调，并引入两阶段推理管道进行精确短答案提取。

Result: 模型在概念级准确度得分达到0.8，显示良好的领域理解能力，但精确匹配(EM)得分显著较低，特别是在测试阶段。两阶段推理管道部分改善了输出冗长问题，但在严格格式化输出方面仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了生物医学大语言模型应用中语义理解与精确答案评估之间的差距，强调了在输出控制和后处理策略方面需要进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evident for accurate question
answering across various domains. However, rigorous evaluation of their
performance on complex question-answering (QA) capabilities is essential before
deployment in real-world biomedical and healthcare applications. This paper
presents our approach to the MedHopQA track of the BioCreative IX shared task,
which focuses on multi-hop biomedical question answering involving diseases,
genes, and chemicals. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning strategy leveraging
LLaMA 3 8B, enhanced with a curated biomedical question-answer dataset compiled
from external sources including BioASQ, MedQuAD, and TREC. Three experimental
setups are explored: fine-tuning on combined short and long answers, short
answers only, and long answers only. While our models demonstrate strong domain
understanding, achieving concept-level accuracy scores of up to 0.8, their
Exact Match (EM) scores remain significantly lower, particularly in the test
phase. We introduce a two-stage inference pipeline for precise short-answer
extraction to mitigate verbosity and improve alignment with evaluation metrics.
Despite partial improvements, challenges persist in generating strictly
formatted outputs. Our findings highlight the gap between semantic
understanding and exact answer evaluation in biomedical LLM applications,
motivating further research in output control and post-processing strategies.

*Felix Engl,Andreas Henrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Topic Model Translation (TMT) 是一种无需对齐语料库即可将主题模型跨语言迁移的新方法，特别适用于目标语言数据稀缺的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言环境下训练主题模型面临算法复杂、需要对齐语料和人工评估等挑战，在目标语言知识缺乏或数据有限时尤为困难。

Method: 提出Topic Model Translation (TMT)技术，无需元数据、嵌入或对齐语料，即可将LDA等主题模型从一种语言迁移到另一种语言。

Result: 通过定量和定性评估表明，TMT能够产生语义一致且连贯的主题翻译结果。

Conclusion: TMT实现了主题模型的跨语言重用，特别适用于目标语言大型语料库不可用或人工翻译不可行的情况，具有鲁棒性和透明性。

Abstract: The training of topic models for a multilingual environment is a challenging
task, requiring the use of sophisticated algorithms, topic-aligned corpora, and
manual evaluation. These difficulties are further exacerbated when the
developer lacks knowledge of the target language or is working in an
environment with limited data, where only small or unusable multilingual
corpora are available.
  Considering these challenges, we introduce Topic Model Translation (TMT), a
novel, robust and transparent technique designed to transfer topic models
(e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topic models) from one language
to another, without the need for metadata, embeddings, or aligned corpora. TMT
enables the reuse of topic models across languages, making it especially
suitable for scenarios where large corpora in the target language are
unavailable or manual translation is infeasible. Furthermore, we evaluate TMT
extensively using both quantitative and qualitative methods, demonstrating that
it produces semantically coherent and consistent topic translations.

TL;DR: 本文在DSTC-12 Track 1挑战中开发了相对小规模模型（少于130亿参数）来预测对话级别的维度特定评分，比较了语言模型提示和编码器分类/回归模型两种策略的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI对话系统的快速增长，如何有效评估这些系统成为一个关键挑战。本文旨在通过相对小规模模型来解决对话系统评估问题，满足实际部署中的计算资源限制。

Method: 采用两种主要策略：1）通过提示使用语言模型作为评估器；2）训练基于编码器的分类和回归模型。所有模型都控制在130亿参数以内，属于相对小规模模型。

Result: 语言模型提示方法仅获得与人类判断的中等相关性，但在测试集上排名第二，仅被基线方法超越。编码器模型在验证集上对某些维度显示出高相关性，但在测试集上性能下降，主要因为测试集的评分范围与训练/验证集存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 虽然小规模模型在某些情况下能够取得不错的评估效果，但测试集分布差异对模型性能有显著影响。语言模型提示方法在资源受限条件下仍具有竞争力，但需要进一步改进以适应不同数据分布。

Abstract: The growing number of generative AI-based dialogue systems has made their
evaluation a crucial challenge. This paper presents our contribution to this
important problem through the Dialogue System Technology Challenge (DSTC-12,
Track 1), where we developed models to predict dialogue-level,
dimension-specific scores. Given the constraint of using relatively small
models (i.e. fewer than 13 billion parameters) our work follows two main
strategies: employing Language Models (LMs) as evaluators through prompting,
and training encoder-based classification and regression models.
  Our results show that while LM prompting achieves only modest correlations
with human judgments, it still ranks second on the test set, outperformed only
by the baseline. The regression and classification models, with significantly
fewer parameters, demonstrate high correlation for some dimensions on the
validation set. Although their performance decreases on the test set, it is
important to note that the test set contains annotations with significantly
different score ranges for some of the dimensions with respect to the train and
validation sets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对比学习中负样本对提升模型语义区分能力至关重要，但现有方法在负样本多样性和质量方面存在不足，需要更有效的负样本生成和文本表示方法

Method: 1. MGH框架：利用LLM生成与查询具有不同相似度级别的多样化负样本，支持从粗到细的课程学习策略；2. ATA池化：基于LLM聚合模式为锚点标记分配更高权重，在不增加模型复杂度的情况下提升嵌入准确性

Result: 在MTEB基准测试中取得了最先进的性能表现，超越了现有的合成策略，无论是在纯合成数据还是与公共检索数据集结合的情况下都表现出色

Conclusion: 该方法通过LLM生成多粒度难负样本和改进的池化策略，有效提升了文本嵌入模型的语义表示能力，为NLP任务提供了更优质的文本编码解决方案

Abstract: Text embedding models are essential for various natural language processing
tasks, enabling the effective encoding of semantic information into dense
vector representations. These models are typically optimized using triplets of
(query, positive, negative) data pairs for contrastive learning, where the
negative samples play a critical role in enhancing the model's ability to
discern subtle semantic distinctions. In this work, we introduce a
Multi-Granularity Hard-negative (MGH) synthesis framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) to generate diverse negative samples with varying levels
of similarity with the query. This approach facilitates a coarse-to-fine
curriculum learning strategy during supervised training, allowing the embedding
model to progressively learn more nuanced semantic representations. Meanwhile,
we propose an Anchor Token Aware (ATA) pooling method that assigns higher
weights to anchor tokens based on aggregation patterns observed in LLMs,
improving text embedding accuracy without increasing model complexity.
Comprehensive experiments on the MTEB benchmark demonstrate that our methods
achieve state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing synthesis strategies
both with synthetic data and when combined with public retrieval datasets.

TL;DR: 本文研究了文本到图像生成模型在职业描绘中的社会偏见问题，通过构建包含5种职业的基准测试，比较了5种先进模型在基础提示词和公平性提示词下的表现，发现提示词工程可以显著改变人口统计特征表示，但效果因模型而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型作为强大的创作工具，存在放大有害社会偏见风险，需要系统评估其在职业描绘中的代表性偏见问题。

Method: 构建包含CEO、护士、软件工程师、教师、运动员5种职业的基准测试，使用5种先进模型（包括闭源和开源），比较中性基础提示词与公平性控制提示词的效果，对所有输出进行性别和种族标注并进行分布分析。

Result: 提示词工程可以显著改变人口统计特征表示，但效果高度模型特定：有些系统能有效多样化，有些会过度校正导致不现实的一致性，有些则响应性很低。

Conclusion: 提示词工程作为公平性干预措施既有希望也有局限性，需要补充模型层面的策略来解决偏见问题。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (TTI) models are powerful creative tools but risk amplifying
harmful social biases. We frame representational societal bias assessment as an
image curation and evaluation task and introduce a pilot benchmark of
occupational portrayals spanning five socially salient roles (CEO, Nurse,
Software Engineer, Teacher, Athlete). Using five state-of-the-art models:
closed-source (DALLE 3, Gemini Imagen 4.0) and open-source (FLUX.1-dev, Stable
Diffusion XL Turbo, Grok-2 Image), we compare neutral baseline prompts against
fairness-aware controlled prompts designed to encourage demographic diversity.
All outputs are annotated for gender (male, female) and race (Asian, Black,
White), enabling structured distributional analysis. Results show that
prompting can substantially shift demographic representations, but with highly
model-specific effects: some systems diversify effectively, others overcorrect
into unrealistic uniformity, and some show little responsiveness. These
findings highlight both the promise and the limitations of prompting as a
fairness intervention, underscoring the need for complementary model-level
strategies. We release all code and data for transparency and reproducibility

TL;DR: 本文提出协作对比解码(CCD)方法，通过对比诱导的欺骗性输入和中性输入的输出分布差异，有效缓解大语言模型中的奉承幻觉问题，无需额外训练即可提高生成响应的真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在面对欺骗性和误导性提示时会产生奉承幻觉，即模型优先考虑与输入隐含视角的一致性而非准确性，这导致生成内容偏离事实信息。

Method: 设计两种范式生成对应的欺骗性/误导性输入以诱导一致的奉承幻觉，然后提出协作对比解码(CCD)方法，通过对比诱导输入和转换中性输入之间的输出分布偏差来减少对欺骗信息的依赖。

Result: 大量实验表明，所提出的CCD方法能有效缓解奉承幻觉，并在各种任务中提高生成响应的真实性。

Conclusion: 协作对比解码是一种无需额外训练的有效方法，能够显著改善大语言模型在面对欺骗性提示时的真实性和准确性表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in
language understanding. However, when LLMs align their outputs with deceptive
and/or misleading prompts, the generated responses could deviate from the de
facto information. Such observations are known as fawning hallucinations, where
the model prioritizes alignment with the input's implied perspective over
accuracy and truthfulness. In this work, we analyze fawning hallucinations in
various natural language processing tasks and tailor the so-termed contrastive
decoding method for fawning-hallucination mitigation. Specifically, we design
two paradigms to generate corresponding deceptive and/or misleading inputs for
the consistent fawning hallucinations induction. Then, we propose the
collaborative contrastive decoding (CCD) to handle the fawning hallucinations
across different tasks in LLMs. By contrasting the deviation in output
distribution between induced and transformed neutral inputs, the proposed CCD
can reduce reliance on deceptive and/or misleading information without
requiring additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed CCD can effectively mitigate fawning hallucinations and improve the
factuality of the generated responses over various tasks.

TL;DR: EviNote-RAG是一个新的检索增强生成框架，通过结构化检索-笔记-回答流程，让模型生成简洁的支持性证据笔记来提升问答性能，解决了传统方法中噪声干扰和多跳推理错误累积的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索-回答范式存在两个主要问题：(1)检索证据中信号噪声比低，有用信息被无关内容淹没；(2)多跳推理中不完整或噪声段落导致错误累积。需要一种更稳健的方法来提升开放域问答性能。

Method: 提出EviNote-RAG框架，采用结构化检索-笔记-回答流程。模型训练生成支持性证据笔记(SENs)，这是简洁的人类式笔记，仅保留答案相关信息，突出不确定性，并明确说明无有用证据存在。通过证据质量奖励(EQR)这一基于蕴含的信号来强化学习过程。

Result: 在领域内和领域外QA基准测试中，EviNote-RAG在准确性、泛化性和训练稳定性方面均优于强基线模型。在HotpotQA上获得20%的相对F1提升(+0.093)，Bamboogle上40%(+0.151)，2Wiki上91%(+0.256)，实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: EviNote-RAG通过支持性证据笔记和证据质量奖励机制，显著提升了检索增强生成模型的忠实性和鲁棒性推理能力，同时减少了噪声影响，在多个问答基准上取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) empowered with retrieval mechanisms have
achieved strong progress in open-domain question answering (QA). Yet, the
conventional retrieve--then--answer paradigm often suffers from two key
limitations: (1) low signal-to-noise ratio in retrieved evidence, where useful
information is buried under irrelevant content, and (2) error accumulation in
multi-hop reasoning when incomplete or noisy passages are involved. To address
these challenges, we present EviNote-RAG, an agentic RAG framework that
introduces a structured retrieve--note--answer pipeline. Instead of directly
reasoning over raw retrievals, the model is trained to compose
Supportive-Evidence Notes (SENs), concise, human-like notes that preserve only
answer-relevant information, highlight uncertainty, and explicitly state when
no useful evidence exists. This distillation process is further reinforced by
the Evidence Quality Reward (EQR), an entailment-based signal that evaluates
whether SENs logically support the final answer. Together, SENs and EQR guide
the model toward faithful and robust reasoning, while reducing the impact of
noise. Experiments on in-domain and out-of-domain QA benchmarks show that
EviNote-RAG consistently outperforms strong baselines in accuracy,
generalization, and training stability. In particular, it achieves
state-of-the-art results while enhancing robustness and efficiency, yielding
relative F1 gains of 20\% on HotpotQA (+0.093), 40\% on Bamboogle (+0.151), and
91\% on 2Wiki (+0.256) via denser rewards and reduced verbosity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 讽刺、反讽和挖苦通常用于表达幽默和批评，但有时会被误认为是事实报道，类似于假新闻。这些技术可以在更细粒度的句子级别应用，因此需要专门的句子级讽刺检测数据集和方法。

Method: 创建了包含13,873个手动标注句子的罗马尼亚语数据集SeLeRoSa，涵盖多个领域。评估了多种基于LLM的基线模型在零样本和微调设置下的表现，以及基于transformer的基线模型。

Result: 研究发现当前的大型语言模型和transformer模型在句子级讽刺检测任务上存在局限性，表现不够理想。

Conclusion: 这项工作为句子级讽刺检测研究开辟了新的方向，揭示了现有模型的不足，为未来改进提供了基础。

Abstract: Satire, irony, and sarcasm are techniques typically used to express humor and
critique, rather than deceive; however, they can occasionally be mistaken for
factual reporting, akin to fake news. These techniques can be applied at a more
granular level, allowing satirical information to be incorporated into news
articles. In this paper, we introduce the first sentence-level dataset for
Romanian satire detection for news articles, called SeLeRoSa. The dataset
comprises 13,873 manually annotated sentences spanning various domains,
including social issues, IT, science, and movies. With the rise and recent
progress of large language models (LLMs) in the natural language processing
literature, LLMs have demonstrated enhanced capabilities to tackle various
tasks in zero-shot settings. We evaluate multiple baseline models based on LLMs
in both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, as well as baseline
transformer-based models. Our findings reveal the current limitations of these
models in the sentence-level satire detection task, paving the way for new
research directions.

TL;DR: 本文提出监督上下文微调(SIFT)方法，将序列标注任务转化为生成式LLMs的自然响应生成问题，显著优于传统方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于因果LLMs的快速发展，预期其在序列标注任务上应超越停滞发展的编码器模型，但现有研究较少关注生成式序列标注这一更自然的设置

Method: SIFT方法结合了上下文学习(ICL)和监督微调，将序列标注任务构建为受限响应生成问题

Result: SIFT在多个标准序列标注任务上显著优于ICL和解码器作为编码器的微调基线，且发现移除指令可以缓解长上下文对性能的负面影响

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在序列标注任务中的优势和局限性，强调了基于响应的生成式任务构建对有效序列标注性能的重要性

Abstract: Sequence labeling (SL) tasks, where labels are assigned to tokens, are
abundant in NLP (e.g., named entity recognition and aspect-based sentiment
analysis). Owing to the intuition that they require bidirectional context, SL
tasks are commonly tackled with encoder-only models. Recent work also shows
that removing the causal mask in fine-tuning enables decoder-based LLMs to
become effective token classifiers. Less work, however, focused on (supervised)
generative SL, a more natural setting for causal LLMs. Due to their rapid
scaling, causal LLMs applied to SL are expected to outperform encoders, whose
own development has stagnated. In this work, we propose supervised in-context
fine-tuning (SIFT) for generative SL. SIFT casts SL tasks as constrained
response generation, natural to LLMs, combining (1) in-context learning (ICL)
from demonstrations with (2) supervised fine-tuning. SIFT considerably
outperforms both ICL and decoder-as-encoder fine-tuning baselines on a range of
standard SL tasks. We further find that although long context hinders the
performance of generative SL in both ICL and SIFT, this deficiency can be
mitigated by removing the instruction, as instructions are shown to be largely
unnecessary for achieving strong SL performance with SIFT. Our findings
highlight strengths and limitations of SL with LLMs, underscoring the
importance of a response-based generative task formulation for effective SL
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学翻译需要高度专业化的领域知识，传统LLMs在医学翻译任务中缺乏足够的领域特定知识，需要整合结构化医学知识来提升翻译准确性。

Method: 结合UMLS和LLM-KB的领域知识，构建2999对英西平行语料和100句测试集，使用结构化提示（多语言变体、医学同义词、UMLS定义）和LoRA微调，在4个开源LLMs上进行评估。

Result: MedCOD显著提升所有模型的翻译质量，Phi-4模型达到BLEU 44.23、chrF++ 28.91、COMET 0.863，超越GPT-4o和GPT-4o-mini基线模型。消融研究证实提示和微调均独立贡献性能提升。

Conclusion: 结构化知识整合能有效增强LLMs在医学翻译任务中的表现，MedCOD框架展示了领域知识集成的重要价值。

Abstract: We present MedCOD (Medical Chain-of-Dictionary), a hybrid framework designed
to improve English-to-Spanish medical translation by integrating
domain-specific structured knowledge into large language models (LLMs). MedCOD
integrates domain-specific knowledge from both the Unified Medical Language
System (UMLS) and the LLM-as-Knowledge-Base (LLM-KB) paradigm to enhance
structured prompting and fine-tuning. We constructed a parallel corpus of 2,999
English-Spanish MedlinePlus articles and a 100-sentence test set annotated with
structured medical contexts. Four open-source LLMs (Phi-4, Qwen2.5-14B,
Qwen2.5-7B, and LLaMA-3.1-8B) were evaluated using structured prompts that
incorporated multilingual variants, medical synonyms, and UMLS-derived
definitions, combined with LoRA-based fine-tuning. Experimental results
demonstrate that MedCOD significantly improves translation quality across all
models. For example, Phi-4 with MedCOD and fine-tuning achieved BLEU 44.23,
chrF++ 28.91, and COMET 0.863, surpassing strong baseline models like GPT-4o
and GPT-4o-mini. Ablation studies confirm that both MedCOD prompting and model
adaptation independently contribute to performance gains, with their
combination yielding the highest improvements. These findings highlight the
potential of structured knowledge integration to enhance LLMs for medical
translation tasks.

Result: 形成了开发通用知识引擎的新方法，能够支持透明、可控和自适应的智能系统

Conclusion: 通过连接结构化和非结构化范式，为构建更强大的知识引擎提供了统一的理论框架和实践指导

Abstract: The making of knowledge engines in natural language processing has been
shaped by two seemingly distinct paradigms: one grounded in structure, the
other driven by massively available unstructured data. The structured paradigm
leverages predefined symbolic interactions, such as knowledge graphs, as priors
and designs models to capture them. In contrast, the unstructured paradigm
centers on scaling transformer architectures with increasingly vast data and
model sizes, as seen in modern large language models. Despite their divergence,
this thesis seeks to establish conceptual connections bridging these paradigms.
Two complementary forces, structure and destructure, emerge across both
paradigms: structure organizes seen symbolic interactions, while destructure,
through periodic embedding resets, improves model plasticity and generalization
to unseen scenarios. These connections form a new recipe for developing general
knowledge engines that can support transparent, controllable, and adaptable
intelligent systems.

Conclusion: 偏好优化与质量驱动细化相结合，为构建更可靠、临床基础的医疗大语言模型提供了可扩展且有效的方法

Abstract: Medical question answering requires advanced reasoning that integrates domain
knowledge with logical inference. However, existing large language models
(LLMs) often generate reasoning chains that lack factual accuracy and clinical
reliability. We propose Ranked Preference Reinforcement Optimization (RPRO), a
novel framework that uniquely combines reinforcement learning with
preference-driven reasoning refinement to enhance clinical chain-of-thought
(CoT) performance. RPRO differentiates itself from prior approaches by
employing task-adaptive reasoning templates and a probabilistic evaluation
mechanism that aligns outputs with established clinical workflows, while
automatically identifying and correcting low-quality reasoning chains. Unlike
traditional pairwise preference methods, RPRO introduces a groupwise ranking
optimization based on the Bradley-Terry model and incorporates KL-divergence
regularization for stable training. Experiments on PubMedQA and MedQA-USMLE
show consistent improvements over strong baselines. Remarkably, our 1.1B
parameter model outperforms much larger 7B-13B models, including
medical-specialized variants. These findings demonstrate that combining
preference optimization with quality-driven refinement offers a scalable and
effective approach to building more reliable, clinically grounded medical LLMs.

Abstract: The demand for text classification is growing significantly in web searching,
data mining, web ranking, recommendation systems, and so many other fields of
information and technology. This paper illustrates the text classification
process on different datasets using some standard supervised machine learning
techniques. Text documents can be classified through various kinds of
classifiers. Labeled text documents are used to classify the text in supervised
classifications. This paper applies these classifiers on different kinds of
labeled documents and measures the accuracy of the classifiers. An Artificial
Neural Network (ANN) model using Back Propagation Network (BPN) is used with
several other models to create an independent platform for labeled and
supervised text classification process. An existing benchmark approach is used
to analyze the performance of classification using labeled documents.
Experimental analysis on real data reveals which model works well in terms of
classification accuracy.

It is also useful to determine the relative importance of a word among the
words in the word-graph. In this research, the ranking of Bangla words are
calculated, representing Bangla words from a text in a word graph using various
graph based ranking algorithms. There is a lack of a standard Bangla word
database. In this research, the Indian Language POS-tag Corpora is used, which
has a rich collection of Bangla words in the form of sentences with their parts
of speech tags. For applying a word graph to various graph based ranking
algorithms, several standard procedures are applied. The preprocessing steps
are done in every word graph and then applied to graph based ranking algorithms
to make a comparison among these algorithms. This paper illustrate the entire
procedure of calculating the ranking of Bangla words, including the
construction of the word graph from text. Experimental result analysis on real
data reveals the accuracy of each ranking algorithm in terms of F1 measure.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了TaarofBench基准测试，用于评估大语言模型对波斯文化中taarof礼仪规范的理解，发现现有模型存在显著文化能力差距，并通过微调方法显著提升了模型的文化对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在处理特定文化沟通规范方面存在局限，特别是波斯文化中的taarof礼仪系统，这种强调谦逊、间接和尊重的复杂社交礼仪在现有文化基准中缺失。

Method: 创建包含450个角色扮演场景的TaarofBench基准，涵盖12个常见社交话题，由母语者验证。评估5个前沿LLM，并通过监督微调和直接偏好优化提升模型表现。

Result: 前沿LLM在taarof文化适宜性方面的准确率比母语者低40-48%，使用波斯语提示能改善表现，标准"礼貌"评分常违反taarof规范。微调方法分别带来21.8%和42.3%的改进。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发文化多样性感知的LLM奠定了基础，揭示了西方礼貌框架的局限性，强调了文化特异性基准的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle to navigate culturally specific
communication norms, limiting their effectiveness in global contexts. We focus
on Persian taarof, a social norm in Iranian interactions, which is a
sophisticated system of ritual politeness that emphasizes deference, modesty,
and indirectness, yet remains absent from existing cultural benchmarks. We
introduce TaarofBench, the first benchmark for evaluating LLM understanding of
taarof, comprising 450 role-play scenarios covering 12 common social
interaction topics, validated by native speakers. Our evaluation of five
frontier LLMs reveals substantial gaps in cultural competence, with accuracy
rates 40-48% below native speakers when taarof is culturally appropriate.
Performance varies between interaction topics, improves with Persian-language
prompts, and exhibits gender-based asymmetries. We also show that responses
rated "polite" by standard metrics often violate taarof norms, indicating the
limitations of Western politeness frameworks. Through supervised fine-tuning
and Direct Preference Optimization, we achieve 21.8% and 42.3% improvement in
model alignment with cultural expectations. Our human study with 33
participants (11 native Persian, 11 heritage, and 11 non-Iranian speakers)
forms baselines in varying degrees of familiarity with Persian norms. This work
lays the foundation for developing diverse and culturally aware LLMs, enabling
applications that better navigate complex social interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 危机沟通中自动化响应的风格一致性对于建立受影响人群信任至关重要，但现有研究很少涉及这个问题。

Method: 首先提出了风格一致性评估指标，然后采用两阶段融合生成方法：先评估候选响应的风格，再通过实例级融合进行优化和整合。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验结果显示，该方法在响应质量和风格一致性方面均明显超过基线方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为危机沟通中的风格一致性问题提供了有效解决方案，通过融合生成方法能够在保持高质量响应的同时减少风格变异。

Abstract: In response to the urgent need for effective communication with
crisis-affected populations, automated responses driven by language models have
been proposed to assist in crisis communications. A critical yet often
overlooked factor is the consistency of response style, which could affect the
trust of affected individuals in responders. Despite its importance, few
studies have explored methods for maintaining stylistic consistency across
generated responses. To address this gap, we propose a novel metric for
evaluating style consistency and introduce a fusion-based generation approach
grounded in this metric. Our method employs a two-stage process: it first
assesses the style of candidate responses and then optimizes and integrates
them at the instance level through a fusion process. This enables the
generation of high-quality responses while significantly reducing stylistic
variation between instances. Experimental results across multiple datasets
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines in both
response quality and stylistic uniformity.

Result: 实验结果显示该框架在生成更易访问和用户更喜欢的反驳方面超过基线方法

Conclusion: 该研究通过提高反驳的可访问性和理解度，为公共健康沟通带来更公平和有效的解决方案

Abstract: Health misinformation spreading online poses a significant threat to public
health. Researchers have explored methods for automatically generating
counterspeech to health misinformation as a mitigation strategy. Existing
approaches often produce uniform responses, ignoring that the health literacy
level of the audience could affect the accessibility and effectiveness of
counterspeech. We propose a Controlled-Literacy framework using
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with reinforcement learning (RL) to
generate tailored counterspeech adapted to different health literacy levels. In
particular, we retrieve knowledge aligned with specific health literacy levels,
enabling accessible and factual information to support generation. We design a
reward function incorporating subjective user preferences and objective
readability-based rewards to optimize counterspeech to the target health
literacy level. Experiment results show that Controlled-Literacy outperforms
baselines by generating more accessible and user-preferred counterspeech. This
research contributes to more equitable and impactful public health
communication by improving the accessibility and comprehension of counterspeech
to health misinformation.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在伊斯兰继承法这一专业领域的知识和推理能力，了解模型在结构化法律推理方面的表现和局限性

Method: 使用包含1000个多选题的基准测试，涵盖多样化继承场景，测试模型理解继承背景和计算伊斯兰法规定份额分配的能力

Result: o3和Gemini 2.5准确率超过90%，ALLaM、Fanar、LLaMA和Mistral准确率低于50%，存在显著的性能差距

Conclusion: 模型在伊斯兰法律推理方面存在局限性，特别是在理解继承场景、正确应用法律规则和领域知识方面，需要改进结构化法律推理能力

Abstract: This paper evaluates the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Large
Language Models in Islamic inheritance law, known as 'ilm al-mawarith. We
assess the performance of seven LLMs using a benchmark of 1,000 multiple-choice
questions covering diverse inheritance scenarios, designed to test models'
ability to understand the inheritance context and compute the distribution of
shares prescribed by Islamic jurisprudence. The results reveal a significant
performance gap: o3 and Gemini 2.5 achieved accuracies above 90%, whereas
ALLaM, Fanar, LLaMA, and Mistral scored below 50%. These disparities reflect
important differences in reasoning ability and domain adaptation. We conduct a
detailed error analysis to identify recurring failure patterns across models,
including misunderstandings of inheritance scenarios, incorrect application of
legal rules, and insufficient domain knowledge. Our findings highlight
limitations in handling structured legal reasoning and suggest directions for
improving performance in Islamic legal reasoning. Code:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 乌尔都语中-ya: kar结构的完成体形式在现代语法中极不自然，尽管19世纪文献中常见，这是由主格主语要求与及物完成体赋格规则冲突导致的形态句法矛盾造成的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究乌尔都语动词和体组合中的范式空缺：-ya: kar结构的完成体形式在现代乌尔都语和印地语中极不自然，但在19世纪文献中却自由出现，需要探究这一历时变化的原因。

Method: 通过历史文本分析、大规模语料库研究（确认完成体形式的明显缺失）以及母语者的主观评价任务（评判完成体例句的自然度）来调查这一历时变化。

Result: 研究发现完成体形式在现代语法中极不自然，母语者认为完成体例句高度不自然，这种空缺源于形态句法冲突：结构要求主格主语和不变分词，与及物完成体赋作格的核心语法规则相冲突。

Conclusion: 这种冲突使完成体形式不稳定，其他结构的功能性替代使这一空缺在现代语法中得以巩固。

Abstract: In this paper, we document a paradigm gap in the combinatorial possibilities
of verbs and aspect in Urdu: the perfective form of the -ya: kar construction
(e.g. ro-ya: ki: cry-Pfv do.Pfv) is sharply ungrammatical in modern Urdu and
Hindi, despite being freely attested in 19th century literature. We investigate
this diachronic shift through historical text analysis, a large-scale corpus
study which confirms the stark absence of perfective forms and subjective
evaluation tasks with native speakers, who judge perfective examples as highly
unnatural. We argue that this gap arose from a fundamental morphosyntactic
conflict: the construction's requirement for a nominative subject and an
invariant participle clashes with the core grammatical rule that transitive
perfective assign ergative case. This conflict rendered the perfective form
unstable, and its functional replacement by other constructions allowed the gap
to become entrenched in the modern grammar.

TL;DR: DistilledPRAG是一种知识蒸馏的隐私保护参数化RAG模型，通过将文档编码为LoRA参数而非明文上传，在保持RAG性能的同时解决隐私泄露问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统需要上传明文文档到云端，存在隐私数据泄露风险。现有参数化RAG(PRAG)虽然通过LoRA编码文档，但存在推理延迟高和泛化性能差的问题

Method: 首先合成单文档和多文档QA对增强跨文档推理能力；然后使用特殊标记掩码明文文档并通过参数生成器转换为LoRA；最后通过知识蒸馏训练参数生成器匹配标准RAG的隐藏状态和输出logits

Result: 在四个QA数据集上的实验表明，DistilledPRAG在准确率上优于基线方法，并在分布外数据上表现出良好的泛化能力

Conclusion: DistilledPRAG成功实现了高效参数化同时保持RAG级别性能，为隐私保护推理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The current RAG system requires uploading plaintext documents to the cloud,
risking private data leakage. Parametric RAG (PRAG) addresses this by encoding
documents as LoRA within LLMs, enabling reasoning without exposing raw content.
However, it still faces two issues: (1) PRAG demands synthesizing QA pairs and
fine-tuning LLM for each individual document to create its corresponding LoRA,
leading to unacceptable inference latency. (2) The performance of PRAG relies
solely on synthetic QA data, lacking internal alignment with standard RAG,
resulting in poor generalization on out-of-distribution(OOD) inputs. Therefore,
achieving high-efficiency parameterization while maintaining RAG-level
performance remains a critical challenge for privacy-preserving reasoning. In
this paper, we propose DistilledPRAG, a generalizable knowledge-distilled
parametric RAG model aligned with standard RAG in document structure and
parameter activation. We first synthesize QA pairs from single and
multi-documents to enhance cross-document reasoning. Then, we mask the
plaintext documents with a special token and translate them to LoRA via a
parameter generator, maintaining the standard RAG document structure. Finally,
guided by synthetic QA data, we train the parameter generator to match standard
RAG's hidden states and output logits, enabling RAG-style reasoning without
original documents. Experiments on four QA datasets show that DistilledPRAG
outperforms baselines in accuracy and generalizes well on OOD data.

TL;DR: REFRAG是一个针对RAG应用的高效解码框架，通过压缩、感知和扩展技术，利用检索上下文的稀疏性结构，在保持性能的同时显著提升解码速度并扩展上下文长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG应用中，LLM处理的长上下文包含大量检索到的段落，但只有小部分与查询直接相关，导致计算浪费和系统延迟。传统LLM优化方法未充分考虑RAG特有的块对角注意力模式。

Method: 提出REFRAG框架，通过压缩冗余上下文、感知相关段落、动态扩展处理，利用RAG上下文的稀疏结构特性来优化计算。

Result: 实现了30.85倍的时间到首个token加速（相比之前工作提升3.75倍），无困惑度损失，并能将LLM上下文大小扩展16倍。在多种长上下文任务中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: REFRAG通过专门针对RAG应用的特点进行优化，在保持准确性的同时显著提升了系统效率，为RAG应用提供了高效的解码解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
leveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and
agentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However,
processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and
demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced
throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system
efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary
objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In
RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval,
with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often
exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during
re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those
in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most
computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be
eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG,
an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve
latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we
demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to
previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization
framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs
by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context
tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document
summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm
that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to
LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.

Method: 提出一个框架，从当代QA基准中整理自然演化、人工编辑的阅读段落变体，并在不同语义相似度分数下分析LLM性能，评估了6个QA数据集和8个具有公开训练数据的LLM

Result: 实验显示，当阅读段落与预训练时版本自然偏离时，LLM性能下降，即使问题和所有必要信息在推理时都存在。例如BoolQ数据集的平均模型准确率从最高到最低相似度区间下降了30%以上，多个LLM的斜率超过70

Conclusion: 自然文本演化对LLM的语言理解能力构成了重大挑战，表明LLM对预训练数据的依赖性很强

Abstract: How does the natural evolution of context paragraphs affect question
answering in generative Large Language Models (LLMs)? To investigate this, we
propose a framework for curating naturally evolved, human-edited variants of
reading passages from contemporary QA benchmarks and for analyzing LLM
performance across a range of semantic similarity scores, which quantify how
closely each variant aligns with content seen during pretraining. Using this
framework, we evaluate six QA datasets and eight LLMs with publicly available
training data. Our experiments reveal that LLM performance declines as reading
passages naturally diverge from the versions encountered during
pretraining-even when the question and all necessary information remains
present at inference time. For instance, average model accuracy on BoolQ drops
by over 30% from the highest to lowest similarity bins, with slopes exceeding
70 across several LLMs. These findings suggest that natural text evolution
poses a significant challenge to the language understanding capabilities of
LLMs.

Abstract: We present Dream-Coder 7B, an open-source discrete diffusion language model
for code generation that exhibits emergent any-order generation capabilities.
Unlike traditional autoregressive (AR) models that decode strictly
left-to-right, Dream-Coder 7B adaptively determines its decoding strategy based
on the coding task: sketch-first generation for complex algorithms,
left-to-right generation for straightforward completions, and interleaved
reasoning generation for code understanding tasks. We adapt a pretrained AR
checkpoint to a discrete diffusion frameworks with a continuous-time weighted
cross-entropy objective. Our post-training recipe comprises (i) supervised
fine-tuning, where we mitigate padding pathologies via random truncation and a
padding penalty to improve sample efficiency and stabilize generation; and (ii)
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards over a curated high-quality
prompt set drawn from open-source datasets, using a tailored reinforcement

Instruct attains 21.4\% pass@1 on LiveCodeBench (2410--2505) and demonstrates
competitive performance on HumanEval, MBPP, BigCodeBench, and CRUXEval. We
release Dream-Coder-7B and Dream-Coder-7B-Instruct checkpoints, training

Result: 该方法旨在提升非拉丁语系语言的跨语言命名实体识别性能。

Conclusion: EAT方法通过实体对齐翻译策略有效解决了非拉丁语系语言在跨语言命名实体识别中的挑战。

Abstract: Cross-lingual Named Entity Recognition (CL-NER) aims to transfer knowledge
from high-resource languages to low-resource languages. However, existing
zero-shot CL-NER (ZCL-NER) approaches primarily focus on Latin script language
(LSL), where shared linguistic features facilitate effective knowledge
transfer. In contrast, for non-Latin script language (NSL), such as Chinese and
Japanese, performance often degrades due to deep structural differences. To
address these challenges, we propose an entity-aligned translation (EAT)
approach. Leveraging large language models (LLMs), EAT employs a
dual-translation strategy to align entities between NSL and English. In
addition, we fine-tune LLMs using multilingual Wikipedia data to enhance the
entity alignment from source to target languages.

a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Multiple low-rank LoRA experts specialize in
different IE tasks and eras, while a task-era-aware router mechanism
dynamically allocates expert contributions. Experiments show that Tea-MOELoRA
outperforms both single-task and joint LoRA baselines, demonstrating its
ability to leverage task and temporal knowledge effectively.

Conclusion: SAT框架有效解决了表示空间对齐和统一指令设计问题，显著提升了LLM在知识图谱补全任务中的性能

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to infer new knowledge and make
predictions from knowledge graphs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have
exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities. LLM-enhanced KGC methods primarily
focus on designing task-specific instructions, achieving promising
advancements. However, there are still two critical challenges. First, existing
methods often ignore the inconsistent representation spaces between natural
language and graph structures. Second, most approaches design separate
instructions for different KGC tasks, leading to duplicate works and
time-consuming processes. To address these challenges, we propose SAT, a novel
framework that enhances LLMs for KGC via structure-aware alignment-tuning.
Specifically, we first introduce hierarchical knowledge alignment to align
graph embeddings with the natural language space through multi-task contrastive
learning. Then, we propose structural instruction tuning to guide LLMs in
performing structure-aware reasoning over KGs, using a unified graph
instruction combined with a lightweight knowledge adapter. Experimental results
on two KGC tasks across four benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAT
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in the link
prediction task with improvements ranging from 8.7% to 29.8%.

Method: 设计了一个模块化、可扩展的框架，通过prompt与LLMs交互生成合成数据。支持SFT、DPO、GRPO等多种训练对齐目标，包含四种核心生成范式：多轮对话、文档基础输入输出、可验证指令响应和长上下文推理。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为提升LLMs的长上下文处理能力提供了一个可扩展的合成数据生成解决方案，有助于解决长文本数据缺乏的问题。

Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to process and reason over long
textual inputs is critical for a wide range of real-world applications.
However, progress in this area is significantly constrained by the absence of
high-quality, diverse, and verifiable long-context datasets suitable for both
training and evaluation. This work introduces a modular, extensible framework
for synthetic long-context data generation via prompt-based interaction with
LLMs. The framework supports multiple training and alignment objectives,
including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO),
and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). It encompasses four core
generation paradigms: multi-turn conversational dialogues, document-grounded
input-output pairs, verifiable instruction-response tasks, and long-context
reasoning examples. Through templated prompting, a model-agnostic architecture,
and metadata-enriched outputs, the proposed approach facilitates scalable,
controllable, and purpose-aligned dataset creation for advancing long-context
capabilities in LLMs.

TL;DR: 该论文针对AI系统依赖自然语言原则时产生的解释性模糊问题，借鉴法律体系机制提出了计算框架来提高模型判断一致性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统越来越多地受到自然语言原则的治理，但语言依赖带来的解释性模糊问题尚未得到充分探索。与法律系统不同，AI对齐流程缺乏相应的制度保障来管理这种模糊性，导致相同规则的不同解释可能产生不一致或不稳定的模型行为

Method: 借鉴法律理论，提出了一个计算框架，包含两个法律机制：(1)规则精炼流程，通过修订模糊规则来最小化解释分歧（类似于机构规则制定或迭代立法行动）；(2)基于提示的解释约束，减少规则应用中的不一致性（类似于指导司法裁量权的法律准则）

Result: 在WildChat数据集的5,000个场景子集上评估了该框架，结果显示两种干预措施都显著提高了合理解释者小组的判断一致性

Conclusion: 该方法为系统管理解释性模糊性提供了第一步，是构建更强大、遵循法律的AI系统的关键步骤

Abstract: AI systems are increasingly governed by natural language principles, yet a
key challenge arising from reliance on language remains underexplored:
interpretive ambiguity. As in legal systems, ambiguity arises both from how
these principles are written and how they are applied. But while legal systems
use institutional safeguards to manage such ambiguity, such as transparent
appellate review policing interpretive constraints, AI alignment pipelines
offer no comparable protections. Different interpretations of the same rule can
lead to inconsistent or unstable model behavior. Drawing on legal theory, we
identify key gaps in current alignment pipelines by examining how legal systems
constrain ambiguity at both the rule creation and rule application steps. We
then propose a computational framework that mirrors two legal mechanisms: (1) a
rule refinement pipeline that minimizes interpretive disagreement by revising
ambiguous rules (analogous to agency rulemaking or iterative legislative
action), and (2) prompt-based interpretive constraints that reduce
inconsistency in rule application (analogous to legal canons that guide
judicial discretion). We evaluate our framework on a 5,000-scenario subset of
the WildChat dataset and show that both interventions significantly improve
judgment consistency across a panel of reasonable interpreters. Our approach
offers a first step toward systematically managing interpretive ambiguity, an
essential step for building more robust, law-following AI systems.

Abstract: Using Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications presents
significant challenges, particularly in balancing computational efficiency and
performance. Optimizing acceleration after the fine-tuning phase and during
inference is crucial for building an efficient architecture. This paper
introduces Zero-Shot Adjustable Acceleration, a novel training and inference
method that dynamically adjusts hardware usage during inference without
requiring additional fine-tuning. The proposed approach is applied to newly
developed models and evaluated across multiple classification and text

*Chenyang Le,Bing Han,Jinshun Li,Songyong Chen,Yanmin Qian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SimulMEGA是一个无监督策略学习框架，通过混合专家门控机制和前缀训练，在同时语音翻译任务中实现了翻译质量、延迟和语义连贯性的更好平衡，无需增加推理时间开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的同时语音翻译系统在多语言多对多场景中难以平衡翻译质量、延迟和语义连贯性，不同的读写策略阻碍了统一策略学习。

Method: 结合前缀训练和混合专家精炼器的无监督策略学习框架，仅需对标准transformer架构进行最小修改，可泛化到语音到文本和文本到语音流式任务。

Result: 在6个语言对上的评估显示，500M参数的语音到文本模型在1.5秒平均延迟下BLEU下降低于7%，在3秒延迟下低于3%，优于Seamless基线。

Conclusion: SimulMEGA框架在同时语音翻译和流式文本到语音任务中都表现出优越的延迟-质量权衡，具有很好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) enables real-time cross-lingual
communication by jointly optimizing speech recognition and machine translation
under strict latency constraints. Existing systems struggle to balance
translation quality, latency, and semantic coherence, particularly in
multilingual many-to-many scenarios where divergent read and write policies
hinder unified strategy learning. In this paper, we present SimulMEGA
(Simultaneous Generation by Mixture-of-Experts Gating), an unsupervised policy
learning framework that combines prefix-based training with a
Mixture-of-Experts refiner to learn effective read and write decisions in an
implicit manner, without adding inference-time overhead. Our design requires
only minimal modifications to standard transformer architectures and
generalizes across both speech-to-text and text-to-speech streaming tasks.
Through comprehensive evaluation on six language pairs, our 500M parameter
speech-to-text model outperforms the Seamless baseline, achieving under 7
percent BLEU degradation at 1.5 seconds average lag and under 3 percent at 3
seconds. We further demonstrate the versatility of SimulMEGA by extending it to
streaming TTS with a unidirectional backbone, yielding superior latency quality
tradeoffs.

*Ege Süalp,Mina Rezaei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于模型增长策略（特别是transformer堆叠）在缓解大语言模型持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题上的效果。研究发现增长训练的模型在阅读理解和推理任务上表现出更好的知识保留能力，但在社会偏见处理方面存在权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾难性遗忘是持续学习中的主要挑战，大语言模型在微调新任务时会丢失先前学到的知识。模型增长策略通过利用小模型来加速和结构化大模型训练，但其对遗忘问题的影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用基于增长的预训练方法（transformer堆叠），比较了使用增长训练的Stack LLM和传统训练的LLM在一系列微调任务（领域知识、推理、阅读理解、偏见）上的表现，评估其灾难性遗忘程度。

Result: 两种模型在领域知识上都有提升，但推理和阅读理解能力随时间退化。Stack LLM显示出更少的退化，特别是在阅读理解方面。在偏见评估中，基准LLM变得更中性，而Stack LLM保持60-61%的稳定偏见比例。

Conclusion: 基于增长的预训练在抵抗灾难性遗忘方面可能带来适度改进，但在处理社会偏见方面存在权衡，需要进一步研究来平衡知识保留和偏见控制。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a significant challenge in continual learning, in
which a model loses prior knowledge when it is fine-tuned on new tasks. This
problem is particularly critical for large language models (LLMs) undergoing
continual learning, as retaining performance across diverse domains is
important for their general utility. In this paper, we explore model growth, a
promising strategy that leverages smaller models to expedite and structure the
training of larger ones for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting problem.
Although growth-based pretraining, particularly via transformer stacking, has
shown promise in accelerating convergence, its impact on forgetting remains
under-explored. Therefore, we evaluate whether growth-based models can retain
previously learned capabilities more effectively across a sequence of
fine-tuning tasks involving domain knowledge, reasoning, reading comprehension,
and bias. Our findings show that both models -- one trained with growth (Stack
LLM) and one without (LLM) -- exhibit improvements in domain knowledge.
However, reasoning and reading comprehension degrade over time, indicating
signs of catastrophic forgetting. Stack LLM consistently shows less
degradation, especially in reading comprehension, suggesting enhanced retention
capabilities. Interestingly, in bias evaluation, the baseline LLM becomes
progressively more neutral with continued fine-tuning, while Stack LLM
maintains a steady bias ratio around 60--61\%. These results indicate that
growth-based pretraining may deliver modest improvements in resisting
catastrophic forgetting, though trade-offs remain in handling social biases.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DaMoC框架，通过数据压缩和模型压缩技术快速选择最优LLM进行微调，节省约20倍训练时间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用任务上表现优秀，但在领域特定任务上需要微调，而如何从众多开源LLM中快速选择最优模型是一个挑战

Method: DaMoC框架包含两个层面：1) 数据层面：系统分类数据过滤方法，增强关键token密度实现token压缩，使用LLM迭代重写文本优化表达；2) 模型层面：使用层相似性评分评估层重要性，移除低重要性层，引入稀疏合并范式保留原始模型能力

Result: 在医疗问答、金融问答、通用问答和阅读理解四个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法能够选择最优LLM，同时节省约20倍的训练时间

Conclusion: DaMoC框架有效解决了LLM选择问题，通过数据模型压缩技术显著提高了微调效率

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in general tasks but struggle with
domain-specific ones, requiring fine-tuning with specific data. With many
open-source LLMs available, selecting the best model for fine-tuning downstream
tasks is challenging, primarily focusing on how to quickly identify the optimal
LLM. We introduce a Data and Model Compression Framework (DaMoC) that addresses
this challenge by: 1) Data Level: A systematic categorization of data filtering
methodologies for LLMs is first established, classifying them into three
distinct paradigms: (1) distribution-aware methods, (2) quality-aware methods,
and (3) hybrid approaches considering both dimensions. Further, we enhance the
density of key tokens in the text achieving token compression. Subsequently, we
use an LLM to iterative rewrite the text to optimize its expression. 2) Model
Level: We use layer similarity scores to assess each layer's importance and
remove those with lower importance. Then, we introduce a sparse merging
paradigm to preserve as much of the original model's capability as possible.
Extensive experiments on four datasets, medical Q&A, financial Q&A, general
Q&A, and reading comprehension, show that we can select the optimal LLM while
saving approximately 20-fold in training time.

TL;DR: 本文从上下文学习和预训练先验的双重关系角度，探索了思维链推理的工作机制，通过细粒度词汇分析和噪声样本实验，揭示了模型如何平衡预训练先验和上下文信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管思维链推理在增强模型推理能力方面日益重要，但其底层机制仍不清楚。研究者希望从上下文学习和预训练先验的双重关系角度，深入理解思维链推理的工作原理。

Method: 1) 对推理过程进行细粒度词汇级分析；2) 逐步引入噪声样本来检验模型如何平衡预训练先验和错误上下文信息；3) 研究提示工程是否能诱导大语言模型进行慢思考。

Result: 实验发现三个关键结果：1) 模型不仅能快速学习词汇级推理结构，还能掌握深层逻辑推理模式，但严重依赖预训练先验；2) 提供足够样本可将模型决策从预训练先验转向上下文信号，但误导性提示会引入不稳定性；3) 长思维链提示可诱导模型生成更长推理链，从而提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 思维链推理的有效性源于模型在预训练先验和上下文学习之间的动态平衡，提示工程可以显著影响模型的推理行为，为理解和改进大语言模型的推理能力提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought reasoning has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing
model inference capabilities. Despite growing interest in Chain-of-Thought
reasoning, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This paper explores the
working mechanisms of Chain-of-Thought reasoning from the perspective of the
dual relationship between in-context learning and pretrained priors. We first
conduct a fine-grained lexical-level analysis of rationales to examine the
model's reasoning behavior. Then, by incrementally introducing noisy exemplars,
we examine how the model balances pretrained priors against erroneous
in-context information. Finally, we investigate whether prompt engineering can
induce slow thinking in large language models. Our extensive experiments reveal
three key findings: (1) The model not only quickly learns the reasoning
structure at the lexical level but also grasps deeper logical reasoning
patterns, yet it heavily relies on pretrained priors. (2) Providing sufficient
exemplars shifts the model's decision-making from pretrained priors to
in-context signals, while misleading prompts introduce instability. (3) Long
Chain-of-Thought prompting can induce the model to generate longer reasoning
chains, thereby improving its performance on downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感是人类社会功能的关键现象，但在文本表现方面仍是一个开放课题。传统方法存在局限，评估方法提供了不同的补充视角

Method: 使用人工标注的工业语料库，采用评估方法进行情感标注。训练语言模型来分析标注数据，验证标注分歧是否遵循统计规律

Result: 标注数据存在显著分歧但遵循稳定统计趋势。语言模型能够成功建模标注过程，变异性由底层语言特征驱动。语言模型能够基于评估标准区分情感情境

Conclusion: 评估方法为文本情感分析提供了有效框架，语言模型能够捕捉标注过程中的统计规律，证明情感标注的分歧具有系统性而非随机性

Abstract: Emotion is a crucial phenomenon in the functioning of human beings in
society. However, it remains a widely open subject, particularly in its textual
manifestations. This paper examines an industrial corpus manually annotated
following an evaluative approach to emotion. This theoretical framework, which
is currently underutilized, offers a different perspective that complements
traditional approaches. Noting that the annotations we collected exhibit
significant disagreement, we hypothesized that they nonetheless follow stable
statistical trends. Using language models trained on these annotations, we
demonstrate that it is possible to model the labeling process and that
variability is driven by underlying linguistic features. Conversely, our
results indicate that language models seem capable of distinguishing emotional
situations based on evaluative criteria.

TL;DR: 本文主张采用"有意文化评估"方法，系统性地检查评估中嵌入的文化假设，超越当前以静态事实为中心的评测范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM文化对齐评估方法过于简化，将文化视为孤立的事实或价值观测试，忽视了文化的多元性和互动性本质，以及文化假设在看似"中性"评估环境中的渗透。

Method: 提出系统性地表征评估中文化相关考虑因素的what（什么）、how（如何）和circumstances（情境），强调研究者立场性的重要性，并建议采用HCI启发的参与式方法让社区参与评估设计。

Result: 建立了有意文化评估的理论框架，揭示了当前评测实践的局限性，为构建更具包容性和文化对齐的NLP研究提供了指导原则。

Conclusion: 需要超越现有的基准测试实践，发现未知的重要应用，通过社区参与的方式重新设计评估体系，以更好地反映文化的多元性和动态性。

Abstract: The prevailing ``trivia-centered paradigm'' for evaluating the cultural
alignment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly inadequate as these
models become more advanced and widely deployed. Existing approaches typically
reduce culture to static facts or values, testing models via multiple-choice or
short-answer questions that treat culture as isolated trivia. Such methods
neglect the pluralistic and interactive realities of culture, and overlook how
cultural assumptions permeate even ostensibly ``neutral'' evaluation settings.
In this position paper, we argue for \textbf{intentionally cultural
evaluation}: an approach that systematically examines the cultural assumptions
embedded in all aspects of evaluation, not just in explicitly cultural tasks.
We systematically characterize the what, how, and circumstances by which
culturally contingent considerations arise in evaluation, and emphasize the
importance of researcher positionality for fostering inclusive, culturally
aligned NLP research. Finally, we discuss implications and future directions
for moving beyond current benchmarking practices, discovering important
applications that we don't know exist, and involving communities in evaluation
design through HCI-inspired participatory methodologies.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在表格问答任务中面临的结构异质性、目标数据定位困难和复杂推理瓶颈等工业应用挑战。

Method: 提出三个关键创新：1）用结构化表模式替代完全文本化的表格；2）查询感知的表缩放机制动态生成子表模式；3）程序思维策略将查询转换为可执行代码。结合ReAct范式实现迭代推理。

Result: 在Qwen3-8B-Instruct模型上，TableZoomer在DataBench数据集上比传统PoT方法准确率提升19.34%，在TableBench的事实检查任务上提升25%。

Conclusion: 该框架在保持可用性优势的同时，显著提升了不同规模表格的性能和可扩展性，为工业应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in the table question
answering (TQA) task through prompt engineering, they face challenges in
industrial applications, including structural heterogeneity, difficulties in
target data localization, and bottlenecks in complex reasoning. To address
these limitations, this paper presents TableZoomer, a novel LLM-powered,
programming-based agent framework. It introduces three key innovations: (1)
replacing the original fully verbalized table with structured table schema to
bridge the semantic gap and reduce computational complexity; (2) a query-aware
table zooming mechanism that dynamically generates sub-table schema through
column selection and entity linking, significantly improving target
localization efficiency; and (3) a Program-of-Thoughts (PoT) strategy that
transforms queries into executable code to mitigate numerical hallucination.
Additionally, we integrate the reasoning workflow with the ReAct paradigm to
enable iterative reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework maintains the usability advantages while substantially enhancing
performance and scalability across tables of varying scales. When implemented
with the Qwen3-8B-Instruct LLM, TableZoomer achieves accuracy improvements of
19.34% and 25% over conventional PoT methods on the large-scale DataBench
dataset and the small-scale Fact Checking task of TableBench dataset,
respectively.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型语言模型在低资源领域适应性的挑战，提出使用参数高效微调技术（PEFTs）来提升模型在未见低资源领域的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然通用性强，但在适应新领域时面临计算成本高、时间消耗大的问题，特别是在低资源且无标注数据的领域。

Method: 使用六种参数高效微调技术（PEFTs）在Llama-3-8B-Instruct模型上进行实验，涵盖科学、医疗、法律和新闻等14个训练数据集，针对文本摘要任务进行评估。

Result: 实验表明，对于低资源领域，使用领域内适配器的推理性能优于少样本学习，甚至优于更大的Llama-3-70B-Instruct模型。在没有领域内适配器时，跨领域适配器和策略性组合适配器也能利用语言相似性提升性能。

Conclusion: 参数高效微调技术能够有效解决LLMs在低资源领域的适应问题，通过利用领域间语言相似性实现更好的适应性和性能表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), being generic task solvers, are versatile.
However, despite the vast amount of data they are trained on, there are
speculations about their adaptation capabilities to a new domain. Additionally,
the simple fine-tuning of the model to incorporate knowledge of a new domain is
computationally expensive and time-consuming. This becomes more challenging
when the domain in question is also low-resource, and labeled data is
unavailable. We leverage parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (PEFTs) on
high-resource datasets to address these challenges to improve performance on
unseen low-resource domains. Throughout our experiments, we evaluate whether
intrinsic linguistic commonalities between datasets can be leveraged for
efficient domain adaptation. We benchmark six PEFTs with
\texttt{Llama-3-8B-Instruct} on 14 training datasets from the Scientific,
Medical, Legal, and News domains for a Text Summarization task. Our experiments
show that for low-resource domains, inference using Within-Domain Adapters can
achieve better performance than Few-Shot as well as a much larger
\texttt{Llama-3-70B-Instruct}. Lastly, in the absence of Within-Domain
Adapters, we explore the concept of using Cross-Domain Adapters as well as the
strategic combinations of adapters to leverage intrinsic language similarities
across domains, facilitating better adaptability and performance in
low-resource settings.

Abstract: We introduce LongCat-Flash, a 560-billion-parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
language model designed for both computational efficiency and advanced agentic
capabilities. Stemming from the need for scalable efficiency, LongCat-Flash
adopts two novel designs: (a) Zero-computation Experts, which enables dynamic
computational budget allocation and activates 18.6B-31.3B (27B on average) per
token depending on contextual demands, optimizing resource usage. (b)
Shortcut-connected MoE, which enlarges the computation-communication overlap
window, demonstrating notable gains in inference efficiency and throughput
compared to models of a comparable scale. We develop a comprehensive scaling
framework for large models that combines hyperparameter transfer, model-growth
initialization, a multi-pronged stability suite, and deterministic computation
to achieve stable and reproducible training. Notably, leveraging the synergy
among scalable architectural design and infrastructure efforts, we complete
model training on more than 20 trillion tokens within 30 days, while achieving
over 100 tokens per second (TPS) for inference at a cost of \$0.70 per million
output tokens. To cultivate LongCat-Flash towards agentic intelligence, we
conduct a large-scale pre-training on optimized mixtures, followed by targeted
mid- and post-training on reasoning, code, and instructions, with further
augmentation from synthetic data and tool use tasks. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate that, as a non-thinking foundation model, LongCat-Flash delivers
highly competitive performance among other leading models, with exceptional
strengths in agentic tasks. The model checkpoint of LongCat-Flash is
open-sourced to foster community research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律基准无法评估开放式和基于法律条款的问答，需要专门针对韩语法律场景的评估基准和方法。

Method: 使用混合LLM-专家流水线创建226个场景化QA实例，提出ParSeR方法通过生成参数化条款进行三阶段检索，并设计LF-Eval自动评估指标。

Result: ParSeR相比标准检索方法在GPT-4o上F1分数提高37.91，LF-Eval分数提高30.81，在不同推理深度上表现一致。

Conclusion: KoBLEX基准和ParSeR方法有效解决了法律条款基础的多跳推理问题，LF-Eval指标与人工评估高度相关，为法律AI提供了可靠评估框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performances in general
domains and are now extending into the expert domain of law. Several benchmarks
have been proposed to evaluate LLMs' legal capabilities. However, these
benchmarks fail to evaluate open-ended and provision-grounded Question
Answering (QA). To address this, we introduce a Korean Benchmark for Legal
EXplainable QA (KoBLEX), designed to evaluate provision-grounded, multi-hop
legal reasoning. KoBLEX includes 226 scenario-based QA instances and their
supporting provisions, created using a hybrid LLM-human expert pipeline. We
also propose a method called Parametric provision-guided Selection Retrieval
(ParSeR), which uses LLM-generated parametric provisions to guide legally
grounded and reliable answers. ParSeR facilitates multi-hop reasoning on
complex legal questions by generating parametric provisions and employing a
three-stage sequential retrieval process. Furthermore, to better evaluate the
legal fidelity of the generated answers, we propose Legal Fidelity Evaluation
(LF-Eval). LF-Eval is an automatic metric that jointly considers the question,
answer, and supporting provisions and shows a high correlation with human
judgments. Experimental results show that ParSeR consistently outperforms
strong baselines, achieving the best results across multiple LLMs. Notably,
compared to standard retrieval with GPT-4o, ParSeR achieves +37.91 higher F1
and +30.81 higher LF-Eval. Further analyses reveal that ParSeR efficiently
delivers consistent performance across reasoning depths, with ablations
confirming the effectiveness of ParSeR.

Abstract: Complex games have long been an important benchmark for testing the progress
of artificial intelligence algorithms. AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and MuZero have
defeated top human players in Go and Chess, garnering widespread societal
attention towards artificial intelligence. Concurrently, large language models
(LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various tasks, raising the
question of whether LLMs can achieve similar success in complex games. In this
paper, we explore the potential of LLMs in mastering complex card games. We
systematically assess the learning capabilities of LLMs across eight diverse
card games, evaluating the impact of fine-tuning on high-quality gameplay data,
and examining the models' ability to retain general capabilities while
mastering these games. Our findings indicate that: (1) LLMs can approach the
performance of strong game AIs through supervised fine-tuning on high-quality
data, (2) LLMs can master multiple complex card games simultaneously, with
performance augmentation for games with similar rules and conflicts for
dissimilar ones, and (3) LLMs experience a decline in general capabilities when
mastering complex games, but this decline can be mitigated by integrating a
certain amount of general instruction data. The evaluation results demonstrate

*Mohammad Zbeeb,Hasan Abed Al Kader Hammoud,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出从经过强化学习训练的模型中提取推理向量，通过简单的张量算术操作即可将推理能力迁移到其他模型，显著提升多种推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通常需要昂贵的优化（如强化学习）来掌握复杂推理任务。本研究旨在探索能否将已学习的推理能力以紧凑的任务向量形式在不同模型间提取和迁移。

Method: 从两个相同初始化的Qwen2.5模型中提取推理向量：一个经过监督微调(SFT)，另一个经过组相对策略优化(GRPO)。推理向量定义为v_reason = θ_GRPO - θ_SFT，然后通过简单算术操作将该向量添加到兼容的指令调优模型中。

Result: 推理向量在多个推理基准测试中带来一致性能提升：GSM8K(+4.9%)、HumanEval(+4.3%)、SciQ(+1.7%)、BigBenchHard(+12.3%)。在对抗条件下性能提升依然保持。相反，减去向量会导致性能显著下降(-11.8% on GSM8K)。

Conclusion: 研究表明通过昂贵的训练开发的推理能力可以从现有开源模型中提取，并通过简单的张量算术重复使用，为通过回收先前计算投资来增强模型提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Large language models often require costly optimization, such as
reinforcement learning, to master complex reasoning tasks. This work
demonstrates that reasoning ability, once learned, can be extracted and
transferred between models as a compact task vector. We source two publicly
available, identically initialized Qwen2.5 models, one fine-tuned with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and the other with group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) on the same dataset. From these, we extract a reasoning
vector: $v_{\text{reason}} = \theta_{\text{GRPO}} - \theta_{\text{SFT}}$. We
hypothesize that this vector captures the reasoning capability instilled by
reinforcement learning while factoring out shared knowledge from the SFT
process. When added to compatible instruction-tuned models through simple
arithmetic, this vector consistently improves performance across diverse
reasoning benchmarks: GSM8K (+4.9%), HumanEval (+4.3%), SciQ (+1.7%), and
BigBenchHard (+12.3% for the 1.5B model). The performance improvements persist
under adversarial conditions. Conversely, subtracting the vector causes
significant performance degradation (-11.8% on GSM8K), demonstrating the
vector's strong contribution to the model's reasoning abilities. This work
shows how reasoning capabilities, typically developed through expensive
training, can be extracted from existing open-source models and reused through
simple tensor arithmetic, offering a practical way to enhance models by
recycling prior computational investments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数字空间中日益增长的仇恨言论问题，需要结合自动化系统的速度和规模与人类审核员的判断力，建立既能够检测有害内容又能清晰解释决策的可信工具。

Method: 构建AI代理系统，使用大语言模型和专门工具：比较新帖子与真实仇恨言论示例、使用BERT分类器标记有害消息、通过Urban Dictionary等来源查找俚语、生成思维链推理、检查平台指南来支持决策解释。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法超越了现有最先进方法，达到了0.91的宏F1分数，表现出优异的检测性能。

Conclusion: WATCHED工具通过支持AI与人类监督的协作，帮助减少网络危害，为审核员、安全团队和研究人员提供了有效的仇恨言论检测和解释解决方案。

Abstract: Online harms are a growing problem in digital spaces, putting user safety at
risk and reducing trust in social media platforms. One of the most persistent
forms of harm is hate speech. To address this, we need tools that combine the
speed and scale of automated systems with the judgment and insight of human
moderators. These tools should not only find harmful content but also explain
their decisions clearly, helping to build trust and understanding. In this
paper, we present WATCHED, a chatbot designed to support content moderators in
tackling hate speech. The chatbot is built as an Artificial Intelligence Agent
system that uses Large Language Models along with several specialised tools. It
compares new posts with real examples of hate speech and neutral content, uses
a BERT-based classifier to help flag harmful messages, looks up slang and
informal language using sources like Urban Dictionary, generates
chain-of-thought reasoning, and checks platform guidelines to explain and
support its decisions. This combination allows the chatbot not only to detect
hate speech but to explain why content is considered harmful, grounded in both
precedent and policy. Experimental results show that our proposed method
surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, reaching a macro F1 score of 0.91.
Designed for moderators, safety teams, and researchers, the tool helps reduce
online harms by supporting collaboration between AI and human oversight.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种领域无关的框架，用于在新领域中选择最佳跨文档链接方法和创建注释数据集，通过半合成数据生成和人工评估组合，在同行审查和新闻领域达到了78%的链接批准率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨文档关系理解对很多应用领域至关重要，但缺乏高效的训练和评估数据集创建方法限制了自动化辅助研究的发展。

Method: 首先生成和验证半合成跨文档数据集，用于自动评估并产生最佳链接方法短列表，然后在涉及自然文本对的深入人工评估中使用这些方法得到性能估计。

Result: 在同行审查和新闻两个领域的应用显示，结合检索模型和大语言模型的方法获得了人类评定者78%的链接批准率，比卓强检索模型单独使用的精确度提高了一倍以上。

Conclusion: 该框架为跨应用场景中的跨文档理解研究提供了系统性方法，所创建的新数据集为多个跨文档任务（如媒体框架和同行审查）奠定了基础。

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained relations between documents is crucial for many
application domains. However, the study of automated assistance is limited by
the lack of efficient methods to create training and evaluation datasets of
cross-document links. To address this, we introduce a new domain-agnostic
framework for selecting a best-performing approach and annotating
cross-document links in a new domain from scratch. We first generate and
validate semi-synthetic datasets of interconnected documents. This data is used
to perform automatic evaluation, producing a shortlist of best-performing
linking approaches. These approaches are then used in an extensive human
evaluation study, yielding performance estimates on natural text pairs. We
apply our framework in two distinct domains -- peer review and news -- and show
that combining retrieval models with LLMs achieves 78\% link approval from
human raters, more than doubling the precision of strong retrievers alone. Our
framework enables systematic study of cross-document understanding across
application scenarios, and the resulting novel datasets lay foundation for
numerous cross-document tasks like media framing and peer review. We make the
code, data, and annotation protocols openly available.

TL;DR: 该研究比较分析了神经音频编解码器(NACs)的统计和语言特性，发现NAC标记(特别是3-gram)表现出类似语言的统计模式，这些特性与语音识别和重合成任务的性能改善相关


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经音频编解码器产生的离散语音标记的统计语言学特性，探索这些标记如何遵循Zipf定律、Heaps定律等语言统计规律，以及这些特性与语音合成质量的关系

Method: 分析多种NAC模型产生的离散语音标记，检查其对Zipf定律和Heaps定律的遵循程度，计算熵和冗余度，使用自动语音识别错误率评估可懂度，使用UTMOS评分评估质量

Result: NAC标记特别是3-gram表现出类似语言的统计模式，这些统计特性和信息含量测量与语音识别和重合成任务的性能改善存在相关性

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了NAC标记序列的结构特征，为设计更有效的生成式语音模型提供了重要见解

Abstract: This study presents a comparative analysis of the statistical and linguistic
properties of neural audio codecs (NACs). We investigate discrete speech tokens
produced by various NAC models, examining their adherence to linguistic
statistical laws such as Zipf's law and Heaps' law, as well as their entropy
and redundancy. To assess how these token-level properties relate to semantic
and acoustic preservation in synthesized speech, we evaluate intelligibility
using error rates of automatic speech recognition, and quality using the UTMOS
score. Our results reveal that NAC tokens, particularly 3-grams, exhibit
language-like statistical patterns. Moreover, these properties, together with
measures of information content, are found to correlate with improved
performances in speech recognition and resynthesis tasks. These findings offer
insights into the structure of NAC token sequences and inform the design of
more effective generative speech models.

TL;DR: LLMs在数学应用题上表现优异，但在识别学生解题步骤中的首个错误方面存在困难。本文提出通过生成中间修正方案来改进错误定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在数学应用题上表现出色，但在元推理任务（如识别学生解题错误）方面存在明显不足，特别是在定位分步解答中的首个错误步骤时表现不佳。

Method: 使用VtG和PRM800K两个错误推理数据集进行实验，提出生成中间修正学生解决方案的方法，使其更贴近原始学生解答，从而提高错误定位性能。

Result: 实验表明，即使提供参考答案，最先进的LLMs也难以准确定位学生解答中的首个错误步骤。提出的中间修正方法有助于改善这一性能。

Conclusion: 通过生成与原始学生解答更贴近的中间修正方案，可以有效提升LLMs在定位解题步骤中首个错误的能力，为解决元推理任务提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance on math word
problems, yet they have been shown to struggle with meta-reasoning tasks such
as identifying errors in student solutions. In this work, we investigate the
challenge of locating the first error step in stepwise solutions using two
error reasoning datasets: VtG and PRM800K. Our experiments show that
state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to locate the first error step in student
solutions even when given access to the reference solution. To that end, we
propose an approach that generates an intermediate corrected student solution,
aligning more closely with the original student's solution, which helps improve
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型通过思维链提示展现强大推理能力，但推理过程不透明，难以在高风险场景中进行验证、调试和控制。

Method: 提出Vis-CoT人机协作框架，将线性思维链文本转换为交互式推理图，用户可可视化逻辑流程、识别错误步骤，并通过剪枝错误路径和嫁接用户定义前提进行干预。

Result: 在GSM8K和StrategyQA数据集上，Vis-CoT相比非交互式基线将最终答案准确率提升高达24个百分点。用户研究显示在感知可用性和信任度方面也有显著提升。

Conclusion: Vis-CoT通过结合大语言模型与针对性人工监督，为实现更可靠、可理解和协作式推理提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong reasoning via chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting, but the process is opaque, which makes verification, debugging, and
control difficult in high-stakes settings. We present Vis-CoT, a
human-in-the-loop framework that converts linear CoT text into an interactive
reasoning graph. Users can visualize the logical flow, identify flawed steps,
and intervene by pruning incorrect paths and grafting new, user-defined
premises. This shifts interaction from passive observation to active
collaboration, steering models toward more accurate and trustworthy
conclusions. Across GSM8K and StrategyQA, Vis-CoT improves final-answer
accuracy by up to 24 percentage points over non-interactive baselines. A user
study also shows large gains in perceived usability and trust. Vis-CoT points
to a practical path for more reliable, understandable, and collaborative
reasoning by combining LLMs with targeted human oversight.

TL;DR: 本研究创建了一个基于世界价值观调查的评估框架，系统评估大语言模型在全球不同国家、语言和历史时期与人类意见的对齐情况，发现模型仅与少数国家意见适当或过度对齐，而与大多数国家意见对齐不足，且通过匹配问卷语言可以更有效地引导模型对齐相应国家意见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注美国或少数国家的人口群体意见，缺乏全球国家样本、不同历史时期人类意见研究，以及使用语言引导大语言模型的讨论，同时忽视了提示语言对模型意见对齐的潜在影响。

Method: 基于世界价值观调查创建评估框架，系统评估大语言模型在不同国家、语言和历史时期与人类意见的对齐情况，并测试通过改变提示语言来引导模型对齐的效果。

Result: 发现大语言模型仅与少数国家意见适当或过度对齐，而与大多数国家意见对齐不足；改变提示语言匹配问卷语言能比现有引导方法更有效地使模型对齐相应国家意见；模型更符合当代人群意见。

Conclusion: 这是首个在全球、语言和时间维度上全面研究大语言模型意见对齐主题的工作，填补了现有研究的空白，提供了系统的评估框架和有效的语言引导方法。

Abstract: Today's large language models (LLMs) are capable of supporting multilingual
scenarios, allowing users to interact with LLMs in their native languages. When
LLMs respond to subjective questions posed by users, they are expected to align
with the views of specific demographic groups or historical periods, shaped by
the language in which the user interacts with the model. Existing studies
mainly focus on researching the opinions represented by LLMs among demographic
groups in the United States or a few countries, lacking worldwide country
samples and studies on human opinions in different historical periods, as well
as lacking discussion on using language to steer LLMs. Moreover, they also
overlook the potential influence of prompt language on the alignment of LLMs'
opinions. In this study, our goal is to fill these gaps. To this end, we create
an evaluation framework based on the World Values Survey (WVS) to
systematically assess the alignment of LLMs with human opinions across
different countries, languages, and historical periods around the world. We
find that LLMs appropriately or over-align the opinions with only a few
countries while under-aligning the opinions with most countries. Furthermore,
changing the language of the prompt to match the language used in the
questionnaire can effectively steer LLMs to align with the opinions of the
corresponding country more effectively than existing steering methods. At the
same time, LLMs are more aligned with the opinions of the contemporary
population. To our knowledge, our study is the first comprehensive
investigation of the topic of opinion alignment in LLMs across global,
language, and temporal dimensions. Our code and data are publicly available at
https://github.com/nlply/global-opinion-alignment.

TL;DR: UniCR是一个统一框架，将多种不确定性证据转化为校准的正确概率，并通过原则性拒绝来执行用户指定的错误预算，提高语言模型的可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部署的语言模型不仅需要决定回答什么，还需要决定何时不回答。现有方法在不确定性校准和风险控制方面存在不足，需要统一的框架来处理异构不确定性证据。

Method: UniCR通过学习轻量级校准头（温度缩放和适当评分），支持仅API模型的黑盒特征，并使用符合风险控制提供分布无关保证。对于长文本生成，通过检索证据监督原子事实性得分来对齐置信度和语义保真度。

Result: 在短问答、代码生成和检索增强的长问答实验中，UniCR在校准指标、风险覆盖曲线下面积和固定风险下的覆盖率方面均优于熵或logit阈值、后验校准器和端到端选择性基线。

Conclusion: UniCR提供了一个从证据融合到校准概率再到风险控制决策的可移植方案，无需微调基础模型，在分布偏移下仍有效，显著提高了语言模型的可信度。

Abstract: Deployed language models must decide not only what to answer but also when
not to answer. We present UniCR, a unified framework that turns heterogeneous
uncertainty evidence including sequence likelihoods, self-consistency
dispersion, retrieval compatibility, and tool or verifier feedback into a
calibrated probability of correctness and then enforces a user-specified error
budget via principled refusal. UniCR learns a lightweight calibration head with
temperature scaling and proper scoring, supports API-only models through
black-box features, and offers distribution-free guarantees using conformal
risk control. For long-form generation, we align confidence with semantic
fidelity by supervising on atomic factuality scores derived from retrieved
evidence, reducing confident hallucinations while preserving coverage.
Experiments on short-form QA, code generation with execution tests, and
retrieval-augmented long-form QA show consistent improvements in calibration
metrics, lower area under the risk-coverage curve, and higher coverage at fixed
risk compared to entropy or logit thresholds, post-hoc calibrators, and
end-to-end selective baselines. Analyses reveal that evidence contradiction,
semantic dispersion, and tool inconsistency are the dominant drivers of
abstention, yielding informative user-facing refusal messages. The result is a
portable recipe of evidence fusion to calibrated probability to risk-controlled
decision that improves trustworthiness without fine-tuning the base model and
remains valid under distribution shift.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型训练后知识静态化，传统知识编辑方法要么过度依赖表面线索，要么在噪声多跳条件下性能崩溃，需要更可靠的知识更新方法

Method: 端到端的推理链编辑框架，包含事实确认、相关性判断、选择性应用和最终推理四个阶段，在单次处理中过滤干扰信息

Result: 在MQuAKE-CF数据集上，将Qwen2.5-7B的多跳问答准确率提升至90.2%，在强干扰下仅下降6.3%，答案泄露时下降<1%

Conclusion: Reason-KE建立了可靠LLM知识更新的新state-of-the-art，具有出色的抗干扰能力和效率

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of world knowledge but
remain static once trained, making the timely integration of emerging facts
prohibitively expensive via full retraining. Knowledge-editing techniques have
thus emerged to inject or overwrite specific facts into LLMs, yet they either
over-rely on superficial cues or incur complex, iterative pipelines that
collapse under noisy, multi-hop conditions. We introduce Reason-KE, an
end-to-end reasoning-chain-based editing framework that steers a pretrained LLM
through four structured stages-fact acknowledgment, relevance determination,
selective application, and final reasoning-to filter distractors in a single
pass. Trained on MQuAKE-CF with up to four irrelevant facts, Reason-KE elevates
Qwen2.5-7B's multi-hop QA accuracy to 90.2% while suffering merely a 6.3% drop
under heavy distraction and <1% when answers are leaked. Our quantitative
analysis confirms Reason-KE's resilience and efficiency, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for reliable LLM knowledge updates.

Motivation: 现有大型语言模型会产生事实错误的幻觉回答，研究者主要使用检索增强语言模型和拒绝后训练两种方法，但当前研究忽视了评估RALMs的拒绝能力，因此需要研究RALMs是否知道何时不知道。

Method: 通过研究不同内部和外部知识状态下RALMs的校准情况，分析各种因素的影响；研究拒绝感知指令调优和上下文微调方法对过度拒绝问题的影响；开发简单有效的拒绝方法来提升拒绝后训练模型的整体回答质量。

Result: 发现LLMs表现出显著的过度拒绝行为；上下文微调缓解了过度拒绝问题，但R-tuning放大了该问题；拒绝能力可能与回答质量存在冲突。

Conclusion: 研究提供了对影响RALM系统重要因素的更全面理解，提出的简单拒绝方法能有效提升拒绝后训练模型的整体回答质量，包括拒绝和正确答案的质量。

Abstract: Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) occasionally generate plausible yet
factually incorrect responses, known as hallucinations. Researchers are
primarily using two approaches to mitigate hallucinations, namely Retrieval
Augmented Language Models (RALMs) and refusal post-training. However, current
research predominantly emphasizes their individual effectiveness while
overlooking the evaluation of the refusal capability of RALMs. In this study,
we ask the fundamental question: Do RALMs know when they don't know?
Specifically, we ask three questions. First, are RALMs well-calibrated
regarding different internal and external knowledge states? We examine the
influence of various factors. Contrary to expectations, we find that LLMs
exhibit significant \textbf{over-refusal} behavior. Then, how does refusal
post-training affect the over-refusal issue? We investigate the Refusal-aware
Instruction Tuning and In-Context Fine-tuning methods. Our results show that
the over-refusal problem is mitigated by In-context fine-tuning. but magnified
by R-tuning. However, we also find that the refusal ability may conflict with
the quality of the answer. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective refusal
method for refusal post-trained models to improve their overall answer quality
in terms of refusal and correct answers. Our study provides a more
comprehensive understanding of the influence of important factors on RALM
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统使用简单的top-k语义搜索，容易引入不相关或冗余信息，导致性能下降和效率低下。

Method: 提出五阶段模块化设计：初始检索、相关性验证、回退检索、上下文优先级排序和令牌预算，实现细粒度知识控制。

Result: 在知识密集型QA任务上，MeVe相比标准RAG实现Wikipedia数据集57%的效率提升和HotpotQA数据集75%的效率提升。

Conclusion: MeVe为更可扩展和可靠的LLM应用提供了框架，通过精炼上下文信息实现更好的基础支持和更准确的事实支持。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically face constraints
because of their inherent mechanism: a simple top-k semantic search [1]. The
approach often leads to the incorporation of irrelevant or redundant
information in the context, degrading performance and efficiency [10][11]. This
paper presents MeVe, a novel modular architecture intended for Memory
Verification and smart context composition. MeVe rethinks the RAG paradigm by
proposing a five-phase modular design that distinctly breaks down the retrieval
and context composition process into distinct, auditable, and independently
tunable phases: initial retrieval, relevance verification, fallback retrieval,
context prioritization, and token budgeting. This architecture enables
fine-grained control of what knowledge is made available to an LLM, enabling
task-dependent filtering and adaptation. We release a reference implementation
of MeVe as a proof of concept and evaluate its performance on knowledge-heavy
QA tasks over a subset of English Wikipedia [22]. Our results demonstrate that
by actively verifying information before composition, MeVe significantly
improves context efficiency, achieving a 57% reduction on the Wikipedia dataset
and a 75% reduction on the more complex HotpotQA dataset compared to standard
RAG implementations [25]. This work provides a framework for more scalable and
reliable LLM applications. By refining and distilling contextual information,
MeVe offers a path toward better grounding and more accurate factual support
[16].

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较不同历史时期和组织背景下社区工会主义的话语特征，考察社区工会主义在不同时期和领域的连续性和普遍性偏偏。

Method: 使用BERTopic主题建模和cTF-IDF权重方法，结合词频分析，对两个工会的文档进行主题分析和话语对比。

Result: Unite Community更外向化、关注社会正义，而B&S工会更偏向内部管理、工业关系和成员服务，反映传统服务型工会模式。

Conclusion: 虽然两者都涉及社区主题，但其参与模式存在显著差异，这对社区工会主义的连续性和普遍性偏偏构成挑战，同时证明了NLP技术在历史劳工档案研究中的应用价值。

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of community unionism (CU) in two
distinct historical and organizational contexts: the National Boot and Shoe
Union (B\&S) in the 1920s and Unite Community in the 2010s--2020s. Using
BERTopic for thematic modeling and cTF-IDF weighting, alongside word frequency
analysis, the study examines the extent to which each union's discourse aligns
with key features of CU -- such as coalition-building, grassroots engagement,
and action beyond the workplace. The results reveal significant differences in
thematic focus and discursive coherence. While Unite Community demonstrates
stronger alignment with outward-facing, social justice-oriented themes, the
B\&S corpus emphasizes internal administration, industrial relations, and
member services -- reflecting a more traditional, servicing-oriented union
model. The analysis also highlights methodological insights, demonstrating how
modern NLP techniques can enhance the study of historical labor archives.
Ultimately, the findings suggest that while both unions engage with
community-related themes, their underlying models of engagement diverge
significantly, challenging assumptions about the continuity and universality of
community unionism across time and sector.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在训练过程中往往捕捉的是虚假相关性而非真正的因果关系，导致在分布外场景中表现不佳。需要一种方法能够让模型有效利用因果知识进行预测和生成。

Method: 提出CAT方法：1) 自动化流水线利用人类先验生成token级别的因果信号；2) 引入Re-Attention机制指导训练，让模型关注因果结构同时减轻注意力分数中的噪声和偏差。

Result: 在提出的Spurious Token Game基准测试和多个下游任务上的实验表明，该方法能有效利用因果知识进行预测，并在OOD场景中保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CAT方法成功地将因果知识注入到注意力机制中，显著提升了LLMs在因果推理和OOD泛化方面的性能，为解决LLMs中的虚假相关性问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various
domains. However, a fundamental question remains: Can LLMs effectively utilize
causal knowledge for prediction and generation? Through empirical studies, we
find that LLMs trained directly on large-scale data often capture spurious
correlations rather than true causal relationships, leading to suboptimal
performance, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address this
challenge, we propose Causal Attention Tuning (CAT), a novel approach that
injects fine-grained causal knowledge into the attention mechanism. We propose
an automated pipeline that leverages human priors to automatically generate
token-level causal signals and introduce the Re-Attention mechanism to guide
training, helping the model focus on causal structures while mitigating noise
and biases in attention scores. Experimental results on our proposed Spurious
Token Game (STG) benchmark and multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that our
approach effectively leverages causal knowledge for prediction and remains
robust in OOD scenarios. Implementation details can be found at

Motivation: 随着任务复杂度增加，基于LLM的工具代理难以正确识别和调用API，需要更好的方法来理解API依赖关系和组合调用。

Method: 将API文档转换为结构化API图，构建专家标注的API图数据集In-N-Out，并利用该数据集进行模型微调。

Result: 使用In-N-Out数据集后，工具检索和多工具查询生成性能几乎翻倍，微调模型能够弥补90%的性能差距。

Conclusion: 显式API图对工具代理具有重要价值，In-N-Out数据集是理解API文档和参数关系的宝贵资源。

way to execute real-world tasks. However, as tasks become increasingly complex,
these agents struggle to identify and call the correct APIs in the proper
order. To tackle this problem, we investigate converting API documentation into
a structured API graph that captures API dependencies and leveraging it for
multi-tool queries that require compositional API calls. To support this, we
introduce In-N-Out, the first expert-annotated dataset of API graphs built from
two real-world API benchmarks and their documentation. Using In-N-Out
significantly improves performance on both tool retrieval and multi-tool query
generation, nearly doubling that of LLMs using documentation alone. Moreover,
graphs generated by models fine-tuned on In-N-Out close 90% of this gap,
showing that our dataset helps models learn to comprehend API documentation and
parameter relationships. Our findings highlight the promise of using explicit
API graphs for tool agents and the utility of In-N-Out as a valuable resource.
We will release the dataset and code publicly.

TL;DR: EAGLE是一种基于自评估的校准方法，通过聚合LLM中间层的内部信念来获得更准确的置信度分数，显著改善了模型校准性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在RLHF后常表现出过度自信，生成看似合理但错误的答案，这给可靠的uncertainty estimation和安全部署带来挑战

Method: 提出EAGLE方法，不依赖最终输出，而是从多个中间层提取内部信念，聚合这些层间信念并计算置信度分数分布的期望值

Result: 在多个数据集和LLM上的广泛实验表明，EAGLE相比现有基线显著提升了校准性能

Conclusion: EAGLE通过利用模型内部隐藏状态来获得更准确的置信度分数，为解决LLM过度自信问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of natural language tasks, but often exhibit overconfidence and generate
plausible yet incorrect answers. This overconfidence, especially in models
undergone Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), poses significant
challenges for reliable uncertainty estimation and safe deployment. In this
paper, we propose EAGLE (Expectation of AGgregated internaL bEief), a novel
self-evaluation-based calibration method that leverages the internal hidden
states of LLMs to derive more accurate confidence scores. Instead of relying on
the model's final output, our approach extracts internal beliefs from multiple
intermediate layers during self-evaluation. By aggregating these layer-wise
beliefs and calculating the expectation over the resulting confidence score
distribution, EAGLE produces a refined confidence score that more faithfully
reflects the model's internal certainty. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets and LLMs demonstrate that EAGLE significantly improves calibration
performance over existing baselines. We also provide an in-depth analysis of
EAGLE, including a layer-wise examination of uncertainty patterns, a study of
the impact of self-evaluation prompts, and an analysis of the effect of
self-evaluation score range.

*Vivi Nastase,Paola Merlo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究句子嵌入空间的几何特性，发现嵌入向量间的余弦相似度并不能预测它们在语言任务上的表现。语言信息通过维度的加权组合编码，而非嵌入空间的表面几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查句子嵌入空间的几何特性是否能够预测不同嵌入方法在语言任务上的相对性能，以验证嵌入空间中的距离与语义相似性的关联性。

Method: 使用三种方法生成句子嵌入：平均化的标记嵌入、特殊[CLS]标记嵌入和随机标记嵌入。计算不同嵌入方法之间的距离，并与它们在多种语言任务上的表现进行相关性分析。

Result: 余弦相似度只能抓取嵌入之间的浅层共性或差异，而不能预测它们在具体任务上的表现。语言信息通过不同维度的加权组合编码，这种编码方式并不体现在嵌入空间的表面几何特性中。

Conclusion: 句子嵌入空间的几何结构不能有效预测嵌入表现。语言信息的编码方式比表面的向量距离更加复杂和细致，需要更深层次的分析方法来理解。

Abstract: Transformer models learn to encode and decode an input text, and produce
contextual token embeddings as a side-effect. The mapping from language into
the embedding space maps words expressing similar concepts onto points that are
close in the space. In practice, the reverse implication is also assumed: words
corresponding to close points in this space are similar or related, those that
are further are not.
  Does closeness in the embedding space extend to shared properties for
sentence embeddings? We present an investigation of sentence embeddings and
show that the geometry of their embedding space is not predictive of their
relative performances on a variety of tasks.
  We compute sentence embeddings in three ways: as averaged token embeddings,
as the embedding of the special [CLS] token, and as the embedding of a random
token from the sentence. We explore whether there is a correlation between the
distance between sentence embedding variations and their performance on
linguistic tasks, and whether despite their distances, they do encode the same
information in the same manner.
  The results show that the cosine similarity -- which treats dimensions
shallowly -- captures (shallow) commonalities or differences between sentence
embeddings, which are not predictive of their performance on specific tasks.
Linguistic information is rather encoded in weighted combinations of different
dimensions, which are not reflected in the geometry of the sentence embedding
space.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的标准化测试平台，用于检测大语言模型生成的现代诗歌，实验结果显示当前检测器无法可靠识别AI生成的现代诗歌。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，AI生成文本与人类文本难以区分。现代诗歌具有独特特征，AI生成的现代诗歌已严重干扰诗歌生态系统，异常紧迫需要有效检测方法。

Method: 首先构建了高质量数据集，包含6位专业诗人写的800首诗歌和4个主流LLM生成的41,600首诗歌。然后系统性评估了6个检测器在这个数据集上的表现。

Result: 实验结果显示当前检测器无法作为可靠工具检测LLM生成的现代诗歌。最难检测的诗歌特征是内在品质，特别是风格。

Conclusion: 这项工作为未来AI生成诗歌的检测奠定了基础，验证了所提出标准化测试平台的有效性和必要性。

Abstract: The rapid development of advanced large language models (LLMs) has made
AI-generated text indistinguishable from human-written text. Previous work on
detecting AI-generated text has made effective progress, but has not involved
modern Chinese poetry. Due to the distinctive characteristics of modern Chinese
poetry, it is difficult to identify whether a poem originated from humans or
AI. The proliferation of AI-generated modern Chinese poetry has significantly
disrupted the poetry ecosystem. Based on the urgency of identifying
AI-generated poetry in the real Chinese world, this paper proposes a novel
benchmark for detecting LLMs-generated modern Chinese poetry. We first
construct a high-quality dataset, which includes both 800 poems written by six
professional poets and 41,600 poems generated by four mainstream LLMs.
Subsequently, we conduct systematic performance assessments of six detectors on
this dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that current detectors cannot be
used as reliable tools to detect modern Chinese poems generated by LLMs. The
most difficult poetic features to detect are intrinsic qualities, especially
style. The detection results verify the effectiveness and necessity of our
proposed benchmark. Our work lays a foundation for future detection of
AI-generated poetry.

TL;DR: TransGAT是一个结合微调Transformer和图注意力网络的新方法，用于自动作文分析的细粒度评分，在ELLIPSE数据集上表现优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动评分作文耗时且不一致，现有自动评分方法使用静态词嵌入无法捕捉上下文含义，且大多采用整体评分而忽略语法、词汇等具体写作维度。

Method: 提出TransGAT方法，将微调后的Transformer模型（BERT、RoBERTa、DeBERTaV3）与图注意力网络配对使用，进行双流预测：第一流生成文章级预测，第二流对Transformer词嵌入应用GAT（基于句法依赖构建边），最后融合两流预测得到细粒度评分。

Result: 在ELLIPSE数据集上的实验表明，TransGAT在所有分析评分维度上平均二次加权Kappa达到0.854，优于基线模型。

Conclusion: TransGAT展示了结合Transformer上下文理解能力和GAT关系建模优势的潜力，能够推动自动作文评分系统的发展。

Abstract: Essay writing is a critical component of student assessment, yet manual
scoring is labor-intensive and inconsistent. Automated Essay Scoring (AES)
offers a promising alternative, but current approaches face limitations. Recent
studies have incorporated Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into AES using static
word embeddings that fail to capture contextual meaning, especially for
polysemous words. Additionally, many methods rely on holistic scoring,
overlooking specific writing aspects such as grammar, vocabulary, and cohesion.
To address these challenges, this study proposes TransGAT, a novel approach
that integrates fine-tuned Transformer models with GNNs for analytic scoring.
TransGAT combines the contextual understanding of Transformers with the
relational modeling strength of Graph Attention Networks (GAT). It performs
two-stream predictions by pairing each fine-tuned Transformer (BERT, RoBERTa,
and DeBERTaV3) with a separate GAT. In each pair, the first stream generates
essay-level predictions, while the second applies GAT to Transformer token
embeddings, with edges constructed from syntactic dependencies. The model then
fuses predictions from both streams to produce the final analytic score.
Experiments on the ELLIPSE dataset show that TransGAT outperforms baseline
models, achieving an average Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.854 across all
analytic scoring dimensions. These findings highlight the potential of TransGAT
to advance AES systems.

Motivation: 需要一种高效的方法来计算基于发音的词语相似度，以便分析语言的音体结构，该方法应该能够处理大规模数据集。

Method: 使用Needleman-Wunsch算法根据词语的音标计算相似度，用Rust实玹算法并在CPU和GPU上并行化，GPU实现利用CUDA和cudarc库，构建全连通图并进行聚类分析。

Result: 方法能够高效处理大规模数据集，GPU实玹带来显著性能提升，通过聚类分析成功识别出音体相似的词语群。

Conclusion: 证明了该方法在语言音体结构分析中的可行性和有效性，并可易于扩展到其他语言。

Abstract: We present a method to calculate the similarity between words based on their
phonetic transcription (their pronunciation) using the Needleman-Wunsch
algorithm. We implement this algorithm in Rust and parallelize it on both CPU
and GPU to handle large datasets efficiently. The GPU implementation leverages
CUDA and the cudarc Rust library to achieve significant performance
improvements. We validate our approach by constructing a fully-connected graph
where nodes represent words and edges have weights according to the similarity
between the words. This graph is then analyzed using clustering algorithms to
identify groups of phonetically similar words. Our results demonstrate the
feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in analyzing the phonetic
structure of languages. It might be easily expanded to other languages.

*Zhengjia Wang,Qiang Sheng,Danding Wang,Beizhe Hu,Juan Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于图神经网络的意图-语义联合建模方法（InSide）用于假新闻检测，通过同时考虑新闻的语义特征和意图信号，解决了传统方法仅依赖表面语义模式的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的假新闻检测方法主要依赖语义线索（如情感词、文体特征等），但这些表面模式在动态环境中容易变化，导致检测性能有限。本文认为通过分析新闻意图可以更深入地理解欺骗背后的思想，而不仅仅是词语的表面模式。

Method: 提出Graph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling (InSide)方法：1）将语义和意图信号重构为异构图结构；2）通过实体引导实现长距离上下文交互；3）采用粗粒度到细粒度的意图建模；4）开发基于动态路径的图对齐策略，在共同空间中进行有效消息传递和聚合。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，所提出的InSide方法相比最先进的方法具有优越性。

Conclusion: 通过将新闻意图纳入假新闻检测，实现了意图和语义的联合建模，能够更深入地理解新闻欺骗的内在思想，在动态新闻环境中表现出更好的检测性能。

Abstract: Fake news detection is an important and challenging task for defending online
information integrity. Existing state-of-the-art approaches typically extract
news semantic clues, such as writing patterns that include emotional words,
stylistic features, etc. However, detectors tuned solely to such semantic clues
can easily fall into surface detection patterns, which can shift rapidly in
dynamic environments, leading to limited performance in the evolving news
landscape. To address this issue, this paper investigates a novel perspective
by incorporating news intent into fake news detection, bridging intents and
semantics together. The core insight is that by considering news intents, one
can deeply understand the inherent thoughts behind news deception, rather than
the surface patterns within words alone. To achieve this goal, we propose
Graph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling (InSide) for fake news detection,
which models deception clues from both semantic and intent signals via
graph-based joint learning. Specifically, InSide reformulates news semantic and
intent signals into heterogeneous graph structures, enabling long-range context
interaction through entity guidance and capturing both holistic and
implementation-level intent via coarse-to-fine intent modeling. To achieve
better alignment between semantics and intents, we further develop a dynamic
pathway-based graph alignment strategy for effective message passing and
aggregation across these signals by establishing a common space. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed InSide compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出了chDzDT，一个针对阿尔及利亚方言形态特点的字符级预训练语言模型，通过字符级建模解决方言处理中的形态复杂性和多脚本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔及利亚方言在自然语言处理中代表性不足，其复杂的形态、频繁的语码转换、多脚本和强词汇影响等特点使得传统词级或子词级方法效果有限。

Method: 开发字符级预训练模型chDzDT，在孤立词上进行训练，不依赖分词边界或标准化拼写。训练语料来自YouTube评论、多语言维基百科和Tatoeba项目，覆盖多种脚本和语言变体。

Result: 构建了阿尔及利亚方言的多语言词典数据集，开发了专注于形态学的编码器模型，为下游任务提供了有效的基础模型。

Conclusion: 字符级建模对于形态丰富、资源稀缺的方言具有巨大潜力，为构建更具包容性和适应性的NLP系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have substantially advanced natural
language processing by providing context-sensitive text representations.
However, the Algerian dialect remains under-represented, with few dedicated
models available. Processing this dialect is challenging due to its complex
morphology, frequent code-switching, multiple scripts, and strong lexical
influences from other languages. These characteristics complicate tokenization
and reduce the effectiveness of conventional word- or subword-level approaches.
  To address this gap, we introduce chDzDT, a character-level pre-trained
language model tailored for Algerian morphology. Unlike conventional PLMs that
rely on token sequences, chDzDT is trained on isolated words. This design
allows the model to encode morphological patterns robustly, without depending
on token boundaries or standardized orthography. The training corpus draws from
diverse sources, including YouTube comments, French, English, and Berber
Wikipedia, as well as the Tatoeba project. It covers multiple scripts and
linguistic varieties, resulting in a substantial pre-training workload.
  Our contributions are threefold: (i) a detailed morphological analysis of
Algerian dialect using YouTube comments; (ii) the construction of a
multilingual Algerian lexicon dataset; and (iii) the development and extensive
evaluation of a character-level PLM as a morphology-focused encoder for
downstream tasks. The proposed approach demonstrates the potential of
character-level modeling for morphologically rich, low-resource dialects and
lays a foundation for more inclusive and adaptable NLP systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，LLM的提示词敏感性可能更多是评估方法的问题而非模型固有缺陷，使用LLM作为评判者可以显著降低性能方差


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视广泛报道的LLM提示词敏感性，探究这是否真的是LLM的固有弱点还是评估过程的产物

Method: 系统评估7个LLM模型在6个基准测试上的表现，使用12个不同的提示模板，比较启发式评估方法和LLM-as-a-Judge评估方法

Result: 使用LLM作为评判者时，性能方差大幅降低，模型排名在不同提示间具有更高的一致性相关性

Conclusion: 现代LLM对提示模板的鲁棒性比之前认为的要强，提示词敏感性更多是评估方法的问题而非模型缺陷

Abstract: Prompt sensitivity, referring to the phenomenon where paraphrasing (i.e.,
repeating something written or spoken using different words) leads to
significant changes in large language model (LLM) performance, has been widely
accepted as a core limitation of LLMs. In this work, we revisit this issue and
ask: Is the widely reported high prompt sensitivity truly an inherent weakness
of LLMs, or is it largely an artifact of evaluation processes? To answer this
question, we systematically evaluate 7 LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini family)
across 6 benchmarks, including both multiple-choice and open-ended tasks on 12
diverse prompt templates. We find that much of the prompt sensitivity stems
from heuristic evaluation methods, including log-likelihood scoring and rigid
answer matching, which often overlook semantically correct responses expressed
through alternative phrasings, such as synonyms or paraphrases. When we adopt
LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, we observe a substantial reduction in performance
variance and a consistently higher correlation in model rankings across
prompts. Our findings suggest that modern LLMs are more robust to prompt
templates than previously believed, and that prompt sensitivity may be more an
artifact of evaluation than a flaw in the models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于Transformer的大语言模型发展，AI面试系统能够实时进行语音调查。本文旨在评估这类系统在定量和定性研究中的数据收集适用性。

Method: 通过评估AI面试系统和传统交互式语音应答(IVR)系统在两个维度上的表现：输入/输出性能（语音识别、答案记录、情感处理）和语言推理能力（追问、澄清、处理分支逻辑）。

Result: 实地研究表明，AI面试系统在定量和定性数据收集方面已超越IVR系统，但实时转录错误率较高、情感检测能力有限、后续提问质量不均，表明当前AI面试技术的实用性可能依赖于具体情境。

Conclusion: AI面试技术在数据收集方面展现出显著优势，但在处理定性数据时仍存在技术限制，其应用效果需要根据具体研究背景进行评估。

Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for "AI
interviewers" that can administer voice-based surveys with respondents in
real-time. This position paper reviews emerging evidence to understand when
such AI interviewing systems are fit for purpose for collecting data within
quantitative and qualitative research contexts. We evaluate the capabilities of
AI interviewers as well as current Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems
across two dimensions: input/output performance (i.e., speech recognition,
answer recording, emotion handling) and verbal reasoning (i.e., ability to
probe, clarify, and handle branching logic). Field studies suggest that AI
interviewers already exceed IVR capabilities for both quantitative and
qualitative data collection, but real-time transcription error rates, limited
emotion detection abilities, and uneven follow-up quality indicate that the
utility, use and adoption of current AI interviewer technology may be
context-dependent for qualitative data collection efforts.

Result: 实现了信息提取的明显提升，提供了可扩展的解决方案，改善了临床决策支持和患者结果

Conclusion: 该方法在医疗健康领域的AI应用中实现了重要进步，通过提高信息提取的准确性和可用性，有效支持临床工作

Abstract: The extraction of critical patient information from Electronic Health Records
(EHRs) poses significant challenges due to the complexity and unstructured
nature of the data. Traditional machine learning approaches often fail to
capture pertinent details efficiently, making it difficult for clinicians to
utilize these tools effectively in patient care. This paper introduces a novel
approach to extracting the OPQRST assessment from EHRs by leveraging the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose to reframe the task
from sequence labeling to text generation, enabling the models to provide
reasoning steps that mimic a physician's cognitive processes. This approach
enhances interpretability and adapts to the limited availability of labeled
data in healthcare settings. Furthermore, we address the challenge of
evaluating the accuracy of machine-generated text in clinical contexts by
proposing a modification to traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) metrics.
This includes the integration of semantic similarity measures, such as the BERT
Score, to assess the alignment between generated text and the clinical intent
of the original records. Our contributions demonstrate a significant
advancement in the use of AI in healthcare, offering a scalable solution that
improves the accuracy and usability of information extraction from EHRs,
thereby aiding clinicians in making more informed decisions and enhancing
patient care outcomes.

Motivation: 主诉记录存在多种录入方式，导致医学术语标准化困难，难以在不同医疗机构间进行标准化记录或文本挖掘

Method: 采用分割匹配算法生成弱标注（实体提及和类别标签），然后训练基于BERT的模型来定位实体提及并将其链接到预定义本体

Result: 在120万条真实去标识化主诉记录上的实验表明，该方法在无需人工标注的情况下优于先前方法

Conclusion: 弱监督实体提取和链接方法能有效解决主诉记录的标准化问题，为医疗文本挖掘提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: A Chief complaint (CC) is the reason for the medical visit as stated in the
patient's own words. It helps medical professionals to quickly understand a
patient's situation, and also serves as a short summary for medical text
mining. However, chief complaint records often take a variety of entering
methods, resulting in a wide variation of medical notations, which makes it
difficult to standardize across different medical institutions for record
keeping or text mining. In this study, we propose a weakly supervised method to
automatically extract and link entities in chief complaints in the absence of
human annotation. We first adopt a split-and-match algorithm to produce weak
annotations, including entity mention spans and class labels, on 1.2 million
real-world de-identified and IRB approved chief complaint records. Then we
train a BERT-based model with generated weak labels to locate entity mentions
in chief complaint text and link them to a pre-defined ontology. We conducted
extensive experiments, and the results showed that our Weakly Supervised Entity
Extraction and Linking (\ours) method produced superior performance over
previous methods without any human annotation.

Motivation: 争议解决在各领域普遍存在，传统方式依赖人工法官。研究旨在探索LLMs作为法官助手，提高争议解决效率和质量。

Method: 开发DRAssist系统，从非结构化争议描述中提取关键结构元素并生成结构化摘要，使用多种提示策略和多LLMs模型在三个层次进行争议解决：识别优势方、评估具体诉求、评价论据强度。

Result: 通过合适的评估指标与相关基线进行比较，评估LLMs在所有任务上的性能表现。

Conclusion: LLMs有潜力作为有效的争议解决助手，DRAssist系统展示了在特定领域应用的可能性，但需要进一步评估和验证。

Abstract: Disputes between two parties occur in almost all domains such as taxation,
insurance, banking, healthcare, etc. The disputes are generally resolved in a
specific forum (e.g., consumer court) where facts are presented, points of
disagreement are discussed, arguments as well as specific demands of the
parties are heard, and finally a human judge resolves the dispute by often
favouring one of the two parties. In this paper, we explore the use of large
language models (LLMs) as assistants for the human judge to resolve such
disputes, as part of our DRAssist system. We focus on disputes from two
specific domains -- automobile insurance and domain name disputes. DRAssist
identifies certain key structural elements (e.g., facts, aspects or
disagreement, arguments) of the disputes and summarizes the unstructured
dispute descriptions to produce a structured summary for each dispute. We then
explore multiple prompting strategies with multiple LLMs for their ability to
assist in resolving the disputes in these domains. In DRAssist, these LLMs are
prompted to produce the resolution output at three different levels -- (i)
identifying an overall stronger party in a dispute, (ii) decide whether each
specific demand of each contesting party can be accepted or not, (iii) evaluate
whether each argument by each contesting party is strong or weak. We evaluate
the performance of LLMs on all these tasks by comparing them with relevant
baselines using suitable evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 预训练语言模型擅长捕捉词级交互但忽略了层次结构模式，难以处理细微语义区分，需要同时理解结构关系和细粒度语义区别

Method: 采用双图编码器构建语义图（依赖解析和主题建模），使用图同构网络传播结构特征；分层对比目标在多粒度上实施一致性，包括节点级对比正则化和图感知对比学习

Result: 在三个法律文档匹配基准和学术抄袭检测数据集上表现显著优于最先进方法，法律法规匹配F1-score达到86.7%（绝对提升6.2%）

Conclusion: StructCoh通过结合结构推理和表示优化，有效解决了文本语义匹配中的结构模式和语义区分问题，在复杂文档匹配任务中表现出色

Abstract: Text semantic matching requires nuanced understanding of both structural
relationships and fine-grained semantic distinctions. While pre-trained
language models excel at capturing token-level interactions, they often
overlook hierarchical structural patterns and struggle with subtle semantic
discrimination. In this paper, we proposed StructCoh, a graph-enhanced
contrastive learning framework that synergistically combines structural
reasoning with representation space optimization. Our approach features two key
innovations: (1) A dual-graph encoder constructs semantic graphs via dependency
parsing and topic modeling, then employs graph isomorphism networks to
propagate structural features across syntactic dependencies and cross-document
concept nodes. (2) A hierarchical contrastive objective enforces consistency at
multiple granularities: node-level contrastive regularization preserves core
semantic units, while graph-aware contrastive learning aligns inter-document
structural semantics through both explicit and implicit negative sampling
strategies. Experiments on three legal document matching benchmarks and
academic plagiarism detection datasets demonstrate significant improvements
over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, StructCoh achieves 86.7% F1-score
(+6.2% absolute gain) on legal statute matching by effectively identifying
argument structure similarities.

Result: DeepSeek表现最佳，显示出更高的忠实度（中位数得分0.528 vs. 0.367-0.457）和更高的专家评分（中位数4.5/5 vs. 4.0/5），且未显著影响可读性。

Conclusion: DeepSeek被定位为案例分析的领先LLM，支持其作为辅助工具集成到医学教育和研究中，并突显其作为领域特定代理的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold transformative potential in healthcare, yet
their capacity to interpret longitudinal patient narratives remains
inadequately explored. Dentistry, with its rich repository of structured
clinical data, presents a unique opportunity to rigorously assess LLMs'
reasoning abilities. While several commercial LLMs already exist, DeepSeek, a
model that gained significant attention earlier this year, has also joined the
competition. This study evaluated four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini
2.0 Flash, Copilot, and DeepSeek V3) on their ability to analyze longitudinal
dental case vignettes through open-ended clinical tasks. Using 34 standardized
longitudinal periodontal cases (comprising 258 question-answer pairs), we
assessed model performance via automated metrics and blinded evaluations by
licensed dentists. DeepSeek emerged as the top performer, demonstrating
superior faithfulness (median score = 0.528 vs. 0.367-0.457) and higher expert
ratings (median = 4.5/5 vs. 4.0/5), without significantly compromising
readability. Our study positions DeepSeek as the leading LLM for case analysis,
endorses its integration as an adjunct tool in both medical education and
research, and highlights its potential as a domain-specific agent.

TL;DR: Genetic Prompt是一个结合遗传算法和LLM的框架，通过将文本语义属性作为基因序列，利用LLM进行交叉和变异操作来增强合成数据生成的质量和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成合成数据方面表现出色，但确保其质量和多样性仍然具有挑战性。需要一种方法来产生更接近真实世界数据分布的合成数据。

Method: 提出Genetic Prompt框架，将语义文本属性视为基因序列，利用LLM模拟遗传算法中的交叉和变异操作。集成主动学习方案来优化父代选择，扩展后代搜索空间。

Result: 在多个NLP任务上的实验表明：Genetic Prompt显著优于最先进的基线方法，在不同大小的生成模型上表现出稳健性能。将合成数据与原始训练集融合能显著提升下游模型性能，特别是在类别不平衡场景中。

Conclusion: Genetic Prompt是生产高质量合成数据的有效方法，适用于广泛的NLP应用场景，能够生成更接近真实数据分布的合成数据。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating synthetic data, but ensuring
its quality and diversity remains challenging. We propose Genetic Prompt, a
novel framework that combines genetic algorithms with LLMs to augment synthetic
data generation. Our approach treats semantic text attributes as gene sequences
and leverages the LLM to simulate crossover and mutation operations. This
genetic process enhances data quality and diversity by creating novel attribute
combinations, yielding synthetic distributions closer to real-world data. To
optimize parent selection, we also integrate an active learning scheme that
expands the offspring search space. Our experiments on multiple NLP tasks
reveal several key findings: Genetic Prompt not only significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines but also shows robust performance across various
generator model sizes and scales. Moreover, we demonstrate that fusing our
synthetic data with the original training set significantly boosts downstream
model performance, particularly for class-imbalanced scenarios. Our findings
validate that Genetic Prompt is an effective method for producing high-quality
synthetic data for a wide range of NLP applications.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型在精确字数控制文本生成方面的挑战，比较基础模型和指令微调模型在英语和意大利语中的表现差异

Method: 使用累积加权归因（源自直接对数归因）分析模型性能和内部组件贡献，研究不同层级的注意力头和MLP组件

Result: 指令微调大幅改善长度控制，深层注意力头在英语中贡献显著，意大利语中最终层MLP发挥更强补偿作用

Conclusion: 指令微调重新配置深层网络以适应任务要求，组件级策略可能根据语言上下文进行调整

Abstract: Adhering to explicit length constraints, such as generating text with a
precise word count, remains a significant challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs). This study aims at investigating the differences between foundation
models and their instruction-tuned counterparts, on length-controlled text
generation in English and Italian. We analyze both performance and internal
component contributions using Cumulative Weighted Attribution, a metric derived
from Direct Logit Attribution. Our findings reveal that instruction-tuning
substantially improves length control, primarily by specializing components in
deeper model layers. Specifically, attention heads in later layers of IT models
show increasingly positive contributions, particularly in English. In Italian,
while attention contributions are more attenuated, final-layer MLPs exhibit a
stronger positive role, suggesting a compensatory mechanism. These results
indicate that instruction-tuning reconfigures later layers for task adherence,
with component-level strategies potentially adapting to linguistic context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法主要关注直接提示精炼或模型微调，忽略了利用LLM固有推理能力从对比示例中学习的潜力

Method: 提出对比推理提示优化(CRPO)框架，从HelpSteer2数据集中检索参考提示，构建两种优化范式：分层对比推理和多维度对比推理

Result: 在HelpSteer2基准测试中，CRPO显著优于基线方法

Conclusion: 对比性、检索增强的推理方法在自动提示优化方面具有广阔前景

Abstract: Automatic prompt optimization has recently emerged as a strategy for
improving the quality of prompts used in Large Language Models (LLMs), with the
goal of generating more accurate and useful responses. However, most prior work
focuses on direct prompt refinement or model fine-tuning, overlooking the
potential of leveraging LLMs' inherent reasoning capability to learn from
contrasting examples. In this paper, we present Contrastive Reasoning Prompt
Optimization (CRPO), a novel framework that formulates prompt optimization as a
retrieval augmented reasoning process. Our approach retrieves top k reference
prompts from the HelpSteer2 dataset, an open-source collection annotated for
helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity, and verbosity, and constructs
two complementary optimization paradigms: (1) tiered contrastive reasoning,
where the LLM compares high, medium, and low quality prompts to refine its own
generation through reflective reasoning, and (2) multi-metric contrastive
reasoning, where the LLM analyzes the best prompts along each evaluation
dimension and integrates their strengths into an optimized prompt. By
explicitly contrasting high and low quality exemplars, CRPO enables the model
to deduce why certain prompts succeed while others fail, thereby achieving more
robust and interpretable optimization. Experimental results on the HelpSteer2
benchmark demonstrate that CRPO significantly outperforms baselines. Our
findings highlight the promise of contrastive, retrieval-augmented reasoning
for advancing automatic prompt optimization.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型评估基于预定义问题集的范式存在与目标交互有限、难度控制不足、评估结果有效性验证困难等问题，难以精确确定目标模型的知识和能力边界。

Method: 提出JudgeAgent框架，采用知识驱动的数据合成和目标自适应难度调整方法，通过基准评分、交互扩展和评估反馈三个步骤进行扩展测试。

Result: 通过大量实验证明了JudgeAgent及其动态评估范式的有效性，提供了准确有效的评估结果。

Conclusion: JudgeAgent框架成功解决了传统LLM评估范式的局限性，为精确评估大语言模型的知识和能力边界提供了有效的动态评估方法。

Abstract: Evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is an essential
step to ensure the successful application of LLMs across various domains. The
current evaluation of LLMs is based on a paradigm that involves querying them
with predefined question sets and assessing their outputs. This paradigm offers
controllable processes and simplicity, but faces challenges such as limited
interaction with targets, insufficient difficulty control, and difficulties in
verifying the validity of evaluation results, making it hard to precisely
determine the knowledge and capability boundaries of target models. To address
these challenges, we propose JudgeAgent, a knowledge-target adaptive dynamic
evaluation framework based on a new interviewer-style evaluation paradigm.
JudgeAgent employs a comprehensive evaluation approach consisting of benchmark
grading, interactive extension, and evaluation feedback. It utilizes
knowledge-driven data synthesis and target-adaptive difficulty adjustment
methods to conduct extended testing, providing accurate and effective
evaluation results. We also introduce a novel insight into validating
evaluation methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of JudgeAgent and its
dynamic evaluation paradigm through extensive experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在处理多模态文档时存在局限：基于布局分析和文本提取的方法只能利用显式文本信息，难以处理图像和非结构化内容；而纯视觉方法忽略了文本的语义优势，导致生成结果不理想

Method: 首先对文档进行结构化解析，获得文本片段和图像区域的共模态表示；然后分别从文本和图像通道检索候选证据，在跨模态检索层面聚合结果；最后提示视觉语言模型基于共模态检索结果生成最终响应

Result: 实验证明该方法显著优于纯视觉基础的RAG方法

Conclusion: 以统一方式将共模态信息整合到RAG框架中是提升复杂文档视觉问答系统性能的有效途径

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a core paradigm in document
question answering tasks. However, existing methods have limitations when
dealing with multimodal documents: one category of methods relies on layout
analysis and text extraction, which can only utilize explicit text information
and struggle to capture images or unstructured content; the other category
treats document segmentation as visual input and directly passes it to visual
language models (VLMs) for processing, yet it ignores the semantic advantages
of text, leading to suboptimal generation results. This paper proposes
co-modality-based RAG (CMRAG), which can simultaneously leverage text and
images for efficient retrieval and generation. Specifically, we first perform
structured parsing on documents to obtain co-modality representations of text
segments and image regions. Subsequently, in response to user queries, we
retrieve candidate evidence from text and image channels, respectively, and
aggregate the results at the cross-modal retrieval level. Finally, we prompt
the VLM to generate the final response based on the co-modality retrieval
results. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
pure-vision-based RAG in visual document question answering tasks. The findings
of this paper show that integrating co-modality information into the RAG
framework in a unified manner is an effective approach to improving the
performance of complex document visual question-answering (VQA) systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型可能反映训练数据中的社会偏见，特别是在印度语境下，种姓和宗教偏见尤为突出。现有的缓解策略多为西方中心，无法处理这些本地细微差别。

Method: 引入宪法感知解码层，基于印度AI宪法指导输出；采用推测解码算法，在生成过程中主动减少偏见；使用小型语言模型作为潜在偏见生成器，大型语言模型作为宪法指导的验证器。

Result: 与基线相比，偏见绝对减少高达26.41%。

Conclusion: AMBEDKAR框架有效减少了LLM中的种姓和宗教偏见，提供了一种无需重新训练的低成本偏见缓解方案，将推测解码重新诠释为公平性机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can inadvertently reflect societal biases
present in their training data, leading to harmful or prejudiced outputs. In
the Indian context, our empirical evaluations across a suite of models reveal
that biases around caste and religion are particularly salient. Yet, most
existing mitigation strategies are Western-centric and fail to address these
local nuances. We propose AMBEDKAR, a framework inspired by the egalitarian
vision of Dr B. R. Ambedkar, architect of the Indian Constitution, to guide LLM
outputs toward fairness, neutrality, and inclusion in line with Articles 14 to
17. Our approach introduces a Constitution-Aware Decoding Layer, guided by the
AI Constitution of India and applied only at inference time, without any
parameter updates to the base model. We incorporate a speculative decoding
algorithm that proactively reduces casteist and communal bias during
generation. This mitigation layer operates directly within the decoding
process, avoiding changes to model internals and lowering the computational and
infrastructural costs associated with retraining. We reinterpret speculative
decoding not merely as an efficiency tool but as a mechanism for fairness. In
this framework, a Small Language Model (SLM) acts as a potentially biased
generator, while a constitutionally guided Large Language Model (LLM) serves as
the verifier. Rather than accelerating generation, the LLM enforces bias-robust
trajectories in the SLM outputs. This inversion of roles gives rise to a
fairness-by-speculation paradigm. Our approach yields an absolute reduction of
bias up to 26.41 percent compared to baseline. Our source code, datasets, and
results are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AMBEDKAR-983B/

Motivation: 解决低资源语言NER任务中大型多语言模型内存和延迟约束的问题，探索小型模型能否通过预训练实现快速适应和零样本迁移

Method: 用一阶模型无关元学习(MAML)替换部分自回归目标进行预训练，在Tagalog和Cebuano语言上进行测试

Result: MAML将零样本micro-F1提升2-6个百分点(仅头部调优)和1-3个百分点(全调优)，收敛时间减少最多8%

Conclusion: MAML元学习能有效提升小型模型在低资源语言NER任务中的零样本迁移能力，表面锚点(如case particles)对性能提升至关重要

Abstract: Named-entity recognition (NER) in low-resource languages is usually tackled
by finetuning very large multilingual LMs, an option that is often infeasible
in memory- or latency-constrained settings. We ask whether small decoder LMs
can be pretrained so that they adapt quickly and transfer zero-shot to
languages unseen during pretraining. To this end we replace part of the
autoregressive objective with first-order model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML).
Tagalog and Cebuano are typologically similar yet structurally different in
their actor/non-actor voice systems, and hence serve as a challenging test-bed.
Across four model sizes (11 M - 570 M) MAML lifts zero-shot micro-F1 by 2-6 pp
under head-only tuning and 1-3 pp after full tuning, while cutting convergence
time by up to 8%. Gains are largest for single-token person entities that
co-occur with Tagalog case particles si/ni, highlighting the importance of
surface anchors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在相同输入提示下往往生成重复单调的输出，特别是在故事生成任务中缺乏创意多样性

Method: 修改token logits，通过两个自适应平衡的相似性惩罚：概念级相似性惩罚（早期优先）和叙事级相似性惩罚（后期加强）

Result: 输出多样性提升2.6倍，重复性平均减少30%，有效缓解文本退化，激活更广泛的神经元

Conclusion: 该方法成功提升了LLM生成内容的多样性，证明了其能够利用模型内在的创造力

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate repetitive and monotonous
outputs, especially in tasks like story generation, due to limited creative
diversity when given the same input prompt. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel decoding strategy, Avoidance Decoding, that modifies token
logits by penalizing similarity to previously generated outputs, thereby
encouraging more diverse multi-branch stories. This penalty adaptively balances
two similarity measures: (1) Concept-level Similarity Penalty, which is
prioritized in early stages to diversify initial story concepts, and (2)
Narrative-level Similarity Penalty, which is increasingly emphasized later to
ensure natural yet diverse plot development. Notably, our method achieves up to
2.6 times higher output diversity and reduces repetition by an average of 30%
compared to strong baselines, while effectively mitigating text degeneration.
Furthermore, we reveal that our method activates a broader range of neurons,
demonstrating that it leverages the model's intrinsic creativity.

Abstract: Large Language Models tend to struggle when dealing with specialized domains.
While all aspects of evaluation hold importance, factuality is the most
critical one. Similarly, reliable fact-checking tools and data sources are
essential for hallucination mitigation. We address these issues by providing a
comprehensive Fact-checking Benchmark FActBench covering four generation tasks

Motivation: 解决大语言模型存在的幻觉、偏见、隐私和高计算成本等限制性问题，这些问题的根源在于语言能力和事实记忆在单一模型中的耦合。

Method: 提出基础语言模型（FLM）范式，使用135M到32B参数范围的模型进行评估，从三个维度分析：语言能力、外部事实知识和内部事实知识。

Result: 研究发现语言能力和事实知识都随规模提升，但内部事实知识增长显著更快，表明模型规模与记忆能力的关系比与核心语言能力的关系更密切。

Conclusion: 支持模块化语言建模方法，使用紧凑、语言能力强的模型作为工具增强系统的基础，为实现更高效、可解释和可持续的NLP解决方案提供路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models offer impressive language capabilities but suffer from
well-known limitations, including hallucinations, biases, privacy concerns, and
high computational costs. These issues are largely driven by the combination of
linguistic competence and factual memorization within a single monolithic
model. This paper introduces and empirically supports the Fundamental Language
Model (FLM) paradigm, which advocates for smaller, linguistically competent
models that offload factual retrieval to external tools. We evaluate models
ranging from 135M to 32B parameters across three dimensions: linguistic
competence, external factual knowledge, and internal factual knowledge. Our
findings reveal that while both linguistic competence and factual knowledge
improve with scale, internal factual knowledge grows significantly faster,
suggesting that model size is more closely tied to memorization than to core
language ability. These results support a modular approach to language
modeling, where compact, linguistically proficient models serve as the
foundation for tool-augmented systems. The FLM paradigm offers a path toward
more efficient, interpretable, and sustainable NLP solutions.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型是否能够不仅推断人类思维模式，还能揭示团队对话中的盲点，特别是团队成员在共同理解上的差异。

Method: 采用两步框架：第一步使用LLM对CReST语料库中的任务导向对话进行共享心智模型元素标注；第二步使用另一个LLM比较LLM标注和人工标注与黄金标准的差异。

Result: LLM在简单的自然语言标注任务中表现出明显的一致性，但在需要空间推理或语音线索消歧的场景中会系统性出错。

Conclusion: 虽然LLM在团队对话分析方面有潜力，但在复杂推理任务中存在局限性，需要进一步改进以处理空间推理和语音消歧等挑战。

Abstract: What if large language models could not only infer human mindsets but also
expose every blind spot in team dialogue such as discrepancies in the team
members' joint understanding? We present a novel, two-step framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) both as human-style annotators of team
dialogues to track the team's shared mental models (SMMs) and as automated
discrepancy detectors among individuals' mental states. In the first step, an
LLM generates annotations by identifying SMM elements within task-oriented
dialogues from the Cooperative Remote Search Task (CReST) corpus. Then, a
secondary LLM compares these LLM-derived annotations and human annotations
against gold-standard labels to detect and characterize divergences. We define
an SMM coherence evaluation framework for this use case and apply it to six
CReST dialogues, ultimately producing: (1) a dataset of human and LLM
annotations; (2) a reproducible evaluation framework for SMM coherence; and (3)
an empirical assessment of LLM-based discrepancy detection. Our results reveal
that, although LLMs exhibit apparent coherence on straightforward
natural-language annotation tasks, they systematically err in scenarios
requiring spatial reasoning or disambiguation of prosodic cues.

TL;DR: DCPO提出动态剪切策略和平滑优势标准化技术，解决RLVR中的零梯度问题，在多个模型和测试集上达到最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法如GRPO存在零梯度问题，主要由于固定剪切边界和契约奖励标准化导致的效果梯度更新不良和生成响应利用不充分。

Method: 提出动态剪切策略优化(DCPO)：1)基于到标特征先验概率的动态调整剪切边界提升到标级探索；2)通过累计训练步骤的平滑优势标准化改善响应级利用效果。

Result: 在四个模型的四个测试集上达到SOTA。AIME24标准化下Avg@1 46.7，Avg@32 38.8，超过DAPO和GRPO。AIME25上达到23.3/19.0，超过GRPO(13.3/10.5)和DAPO(20.0/15.3)。非零优势提升28%，训练效率提升2倍，剪切比率降低一个数量级。

Conclusion: DCPO能够更有效地利用生成数据进行强化学习，通过动态剪切和平滑标准化技术解决了零梯度问题，显著提升了大语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
promising framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models. However, existing approaches such as GRPO often suffer from zero
gradients. This problem arises primarily due to fixed clipping bounds for
token-level probability ratios and the standardization of identical rewards,
which can lead to ineffective gradient updates and underutilization of
generated responses. In this work, we propose Dynamic Clipping Policy
Optimization (DCPO), which introduces a dynamic clipping strategy that
adaptively adjusts the clipping bounds based on token-specific prior
probabilities to enhance token-level exploration, and a smooth advantage
standardization technique that standardizes rewards across cumulative training
steps to improve the response-level effective utilization of generated
responses. DCPO achieved state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks based
on four different models. In particular, DCPO achieved an Avg@1 of 46.7 under
greedy decoding and an Avg@32 of 38.8 under 32 times sampling on the AIME24
benchmark, surpassing both DAPO (36.7/31.6) and GRPO (36.7/32.1) on the
Qwen2.5-Math-7B model. On the AIME25 benchmark based on Qwen2.5-14B, DCPO
achieves a performance of (23.3/19.0), surpassing GRPO (13.3/10.5) and DAPO
(20.0/15.3). Furthermore, DCPO achieved an average 28% improvement in the
nonzero advantage over GRPO in four models, doubled the training efficiency
over DAPO, and significantly reduced the token clipping ratio by an order of
magnitude compared to both GRPO and DAPO, while achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across a
wide range of tasks. Reasoning with LLMs is central to solving multi-step
problems and complex decision-making. To support efficient reasoning, recent
studies have shifted attention from explicit chain-of-thought prompting toward
implicit reasoning, where reasoning occurs silently via latent structures
without emitting intermediate textual steps. Implicit reasoning brings
advantages such as lower generation cost, faster inference, and better
alignment with internal computation. Although prior surveys have discussed
latent representations in the context of reasoning, a dedicated and
mechanism-level examination of how reasoning unfolds internally within LLMs
remains absent. This survey fills that gap by introducing a taxonomy centered
on execution paradigms, shifting the focus from representational forms to
computational strategies. We organize existing methods into three execution
paradigms based on \textbf{\textit{how and where internal computation
unfolds}}: latent optimization, signal-guided control, and layer-recurrent
execution. We also review structural, behavioral and representation-based
evidence that supports the presence of implicit reasoning in LLMs. We further
provide a structured overview of the evaluation metrics and benchmarks used in
existing works to assess the effectiveness and reliability of implicit
reasoning.We maintain a continuously updated project at:

Motivation: 现有方法在时间序列意见分析方面潜力未充分发挥，缺乏时态基础的细粒度注释数据

Method: 集成成熟的意见挖掘形式到声明式LLM注释流水线中，定义三种基于情感和意见挖掘文献的数据模型作为结构表示模板

Result: 使用人工注释测试样本进行严格的量化评估，通过两个独立LLM完成最终注释，并在细粒度意见维度上计算标签一致性

Conclusion: 构建的知识库包含时间对齐的结构化意见，与RAG、时态问答和时间线摘要等应用相兼容

Abstract: We propose a scalable method for constructing a temporal opinion knowledge
base with large language models (LLMs) as automated annotators. Despite the
demonstrated utility of time-series opinion analysis of text for downstream
applications such as forecasting and trend analysis, existing methodologies
underexploit this potential due to the absence of temporally grounded
fine-grained annotations. Our approach addresses this gap by integrating
well-established opinion mining formulations into a declarative LLM annotation
pipeline, enabling structured opinion extraction without manual prompt
engineering. We define three data models grounded in sentiment and opinion
mining literature, serving as schemas for structured representation. We perform
rigorous quantitative evaluation of our pipeline using human-annotated test
samples. We carry out the final annotations using two separate LLMs, and
inter-annotator agreement is computed label-wise across the fine-grained
opinion dimensions, analogous to human annotation protocols. The resulting
knowledge base encapsulates time-aligned, structured opinions and is compatible
with applications in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), temporal question
answering, and timeline summarisation.

Conclusion: 这是首次将LLM基于预处理、细调阿拉伯语变换器模型和集成学习结合的研究，显示了通过多种文本表征和模型预测的结合可以有效提高医学文本理解能力

Abstract: Social telehealth has made remarkable progress in healthcare by allowing
patients to post symptoms and participate in medical consultations remotely.
Users frequently post symptoms on social media and online health platforms,
creating a huge repository of medical data that can be leveraged for disease
classification. Large language models (LLMs) such as LLAMA3 and GPT-3.5, along
with transformer-based models like BERT, have demonstrated strong capabilities
in processing complex medical text. In this study, we evaluate three Arabic
medical text preprocessing methods such as summarization, refinement, and Named
Entity Recognition (NER) before applying fine-tuned Arabic transformer models
(CAMeLBERT, AraBERT, and AsafayaBERT). To enhance robustness, we adopt a
majority voting ensemble that combines predictions from original and
preprocessed text representations. This approach achieved the best
classification accuracy of 80.56%, thus showing its effectiveness in leveraging
various text representations and model predictions to improve the understanding
of medical texts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
integrates LLM-based preprocessing with fine-tuned Arabic transformer models
and ensemble learning for disease classification in Arabic social telehealth
data.

Motivation: 现有的人格检测方法严重依赖大规模标注数据集，难以获得高质量人格标签，且大多将情感和人格视为独立变量，忽略了它们的相互作用。

Method: 提出EmoPerso框架：1）利用生成机制进行合成数据增强和丰富表征学习；2）提取伪标签情感特征并通过多任务学习与人格预测联合优化；3）使用跨注意力模块捕捉人格特质与情感表征的细粒度交互；4）采用自学习策略迭代增强模型推理能力。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，EmoPerso超越了最先进的模型。

Conclusion: EmoPerso通过情感感知建模和自监督学习有效提升了人格检测性能，证明了情感与人格相互作用的重要性。

Abstract: Personality detection from text is commonly performed by analysing users'
social media posts. However, existing methods heavily rely on large-scale
annotated datasets, making it challenging to obtain high-quality personality
labels. Moreover, most studies treat emotion and personality as independent
variables, overlooking their interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel
self-supervised framework, EmoPerso, which improves personality detection
through emotion-aware modelling. EmoPerso first leverages generative mechanisms
for synthetic data augmentation and rich representation learning. It then
extracts pseudo-labeled emotion features and jointly optimizes them with
personality prediction via multi-task learning. A cross-attention module is
employed to capture fine-grained interactions between personality traits and
the inferred emotional representations. To further refine relational reasoning,
EmoPerso adopts a self-taught strategy to enhance the model's reasoning
capabilities iteratively. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets
demonstrate that EmoPerso surpasses state-of-the-art models. The source code is

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM在处理外部标签定义时主要依赖内部参数化知识，而非真正整合外部定义，特别是在通用任务中表现明显，而领域特定任务能更多受益于显式定义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLM是否真正整合外部定义，还是主要依赖其参数化知识来处理任务，以理解模型如何结合外部知识和内部能力。

Method: 在多个解释基准数据集（通用和领域特定）上进行控制实验，使用专家策划、LLM生成、扰动和交换的定义等不同标签定义条件。

Result: 显式标签定义能提高准确性和可解释性，但LLM对定义的整合既不保证也不一致，模型往往默认使用内部表示，特别是在通用任务中。

Conclusion: 需要更深入理解LLM如何处理外部知识与预训练能力的关系，模型对外部定义的依赖程度因任务类型而异。

Abstract: Do LLMs genuinely incorporate external definitions, or do they primarily rely
on their parametric knowledge? To address these questions, we conduct
controlled experiments across multiple explanation benchmark datasets (general
and domain-specific) and label definition conditions, including expert-curated,
LLM-generated, perturbed, and swapped definitions. Our results reveal that
while explicit label definitions can enhance accuracy and explainability, their
integration into an LLM's task-solving processes is neither guaranteed nor
consistent, suggesting reliance on internalized representations in many cases.
Models often default to their internal representations, particularly in general
tasks, whereas domain-specific tasks benefit more from explicit definitions.
These findings underscore the need for a deeper understanding of how LLMs
process external knowledge alongside their pre-existing capabilities.

Method: 自动化框架解析行为声明、生成针对性提示、使用模型判断遵循情况，重点在公司规范、模型输出和公司评估模型的三方一致性

Result: 在16个模型和100+行为声明中发现系统性不一致性，最高达20%的遵循差距

Conclusion: 基础模型并非始终遵守公司指南，需要审计机制确保一致性，三方一致性作为基础要求

Abstract: Companies that develop foundation models publish behavioral guidelines they
pledge their models will follow, but it remains unclear if models actually do
so. While providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have published
detailed specifications describing both desired safety constraints and
qualitative traits for their models, there has been no systematic audit of
adherence to these guidelines. We introduce an automated framework that audits
models against their providers specifications by parsing behavioral statements,
generating targeted prompts, and using models to judge adherence. Our central
focus is on three way consistency between a provider specification, its model
outputs, and its own models as judges; an extension of prior two way generator
validator consistency. This establishes a necessary baseline: at minimum, a
foundation model should consistently satisfy the developer behavioral
specifications when judged by the developer evaluator models. We apply our
framework to 16 models from six developers across more than 100 behavioral
statements, finding systematic inconsistencies including compliance gaps of up
to 20 percent across providers.

Conclusion: GRAM-R²可以作为奖励推理的基础模型，支持下游应用如响应排序和任务特定奖励调优，在广泛任务中表现出强大性能

Abstract: Significant progress in reward modeling over recent years has been driven by
a paradigm shift from task-specific designs towards generalist reward models.
Despite this trend, developing effective reward models remains a fundamental
challenge: the heavy reliance on large-scale labeled preference data.
Pre-training on abundant unlabeled data offers a promising direction, but
existing approaches fall short of instilling explicit reasoning into reward
models. To bridge this gap, we propose a self-training approach that leverages
unlabeled data to elicit reward reasoning in reward models. Based on this
approach, we develop GRAM-R$^2$, a generative reward model trained to produce
not only preference labels but also accompanying reward rationales. GRAM-R$^2$
can serve as a foundation model for reward reasoning and can be applied to a
wide range of tasks with minimal or no additional fine-tuning. It can support
downstream applications such as response ranking and task-specific reward
tuning. Experiments on response ranking, task adaptation, and reinforcement
learning from human feedback demonstrate that GRAM-R$^2$ consistently delivers
strong performance, outperforming several strong discriminative and generative
baselines.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速发展引发了对滥用的担忧，现有检测方法忽视风格建模且依赖静态阈值，限制了检测性能

Method: MoSEs框架包含三个核心组件：风格参考库(SRR)、风格感知路由器(SAR)和条件阈值估计器(CTE)，通过动态确定最优阈值进行检测

Result: 相比基线方法平均提升11.34%的检测性能，在低资源情况下提升更显著达39.15%

Conclusion: MoSEs框架通过风格感知的条件阈值估计有效提升了AI生成文本检测的准确性和鲁棒性

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has intensified public
concerns about the potential misuse. Therefore, it is important to build
trustworthy AI-generated text detection systems. Existing methods neglect
stylistic modeling and mostly rely on static thresholds, which greatly limits
the detection performance. In this paper, we propose the Mixture of Stylistic
Experts (MoSEs) framework that enables stylistics-aware uncertainty
quantification through conditional threshold estimation. MoSEs contain three
core components, namely, the Stylistics Reference Repository (SRR), the
Stylistics-Aware Router (SAR), and the Conditional Threshold Estimator (CTE).
For input text, SRR can activate the appropriate reference data in SRR and
provide them to CTE. Subsequently, CTE jointly models the linguistic
statistical properties and semantic features to dynamically determine the
optimal threshold. With a discrimination score, MoSEs yields prediction labels
with the corresponding confidence level. Our framework achieves an average
improvement 11.34% in detection performance compared to baselines. More
inspiringly, MoSEs shows a more evident improvement 39.15% in the low-resource
case. Our code is available at https://github.com/creator-xi/MoSEs.

Abstract: Semantic evaluation in low-resource languages remains a major challenge in
NLP. While sentence transformers have shown strong performance in high-resource
settings, their effectiveness in Indic languages is underexplored due to a lack
of high-quality benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce
L3Cube-IndicHeadline-ID, a curated headline identification dataset spanning ten
low-resource Indic languages: Marathi, Hindi, Tamil, Gujarati, Odia, Kannada,
Malayalam, Punjabi, Telugu, Bengali and English. Each language includes 20,000
news articles paired with four headline variants: the original, a semantically
similar version, a lexically similar version, and an unrelated one, designed to
test fine-grained semantic understanding. The task requires selecting the
correct headline from the options using article-headline similarity. We
benchmark several sentence transformers, including multilingual and
language-specific models, using cosine similarity. Results show that
multilingual models consistently perform well, while language-specific models
vary in effectiveness. Given the rising use of similarity models in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, this dataset also serves as a
valuable resource for evaluating and improving semantic understanding in such
applications. Additionally, the dataset can be repurposed for multiple-choice
question answering, headline classification, or other task-specific evaluations
of LLMs, making it a versatile benchmark for Indic NLP. The dataset is shared

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新发现和验证Federico Pucci在1931年提出的机械翻译系统，证明其在机器翻译历史上的重要地位，并探索其方法在现代AI技术下的应用潜力。

Method: 使用AI按照Pucci的原始方法重新翻译1931年文献中的两个文本片段（但丁《新生》和伏尔泰《查第格》），然后扩展到英语、西班牙语和德语的翻译，最后应用于现代技术文本。

Result: AI按照Pucci方法翻译的结果与94年前的原始翻译差异很小，验证了该系统的有效性。系统成功扩展到多种语言，并能处理现代技术文本。

Conclusion: Pucci的机械翻译系统经AI验证有效，应被认可为机器翻译领域的先驱，其工作应与Troyanskij、Booth和Weaver等人并列，重新书写机器翻译历史。

Abstract: A pioneering rule-based mechanical translation system (precursor of modern
RBMTs) was first presented in December 1929 by its inventor, Federico Pucci,
who later published the full method in a book titled "Il traduttore meccanico
ed il metodo per corrispondersi fra Europei conoscendo ciascuno solo la propria
lingua: Parte I", in Salerno (Italy), in 1931. This study illustrates how AI
breathes new life into the system of international keys and ideograms devised
by Pucci to translate from/into any Romance language (at least as a first
step). The methodology involves having the AIs retranslate, following Pucci's
method, the two text excerpts originally translated in 1931 and clearly
documented in his publication: a passage from Dante's La Vita Nuova, translated
from Italian into French, and a passage from Voltaire's Zadig, translated from
French into Italian. The result is notable: the two texts, translated 94 years
apart using the same method--by Pucci in 1931 and by AIs in 2025--show a low
average difference, with only minor variations observed. With Pucci's system
thus validated, it became feasible to have the AIs reproduce the excerpts in
English, Spanish, and German according to his method. The results were
consistent, and Pucci--via Artificial Intelligence--was tasked with translating
more modern and technical texts, thereby reviving, nearly a century later, an
invention that had remained almost entirely unknown and never applied beyond
its creator, now brought to wider attention and opened to possible
experimentation. Such a demonstration would not only affirm Pucci's historical
status but also place him among the precursors and intellectual contributors to
machine translation, whose work merits examination alongside figures such as
Troyanskij, Booth, and Weaver, with possible consequences for how the history
of the field is understood.

Motivation: 现有截断采样方法（如温度缩放、top-p、min-p采样）在有效整合模型置信度方面存在局限，特别是min-p采样仅依赖单个顶部token作为置信度启发式，未能充分利用概率分布信息

Method: 首先建立熵约束最小散度问题的理论框架，证明其等价于NP难的熵约束质量最大化问题，然后提出计算高效的top-H贪婪算法求解

Result: 在创意写作基准测试中比min-p采样提升25.63%，在GPQA、GSM8K和MT-Bench等问答数据集上保持鲁棒性，LLM作为评判者的评估确认即使在高温度下也能产生连贯输出

Conclusion: top-H推进了开放文本生成的最新技术，可轻松集成到创意写作应用中，在保持连贯性的同时显著提升生成多样性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their impressive performance across a
wide range of tasks, often struggle to balance two competing objectives in
open-ended text generation: fostering diversity and creativity while preserving
logical coherence. Existing truncated sampling techniques, including
temperature scaling, top-\$p\$ (nucleus) sampling, and min-\$p\$ sampling, aim
to manage this trade-off. However, they exhibit limitations, particularly in
the effective incorporation of the confidence of the model into the
corresponding sampling strategy. For example, min-\$p\$ sampling relies on a
single top token as a heuristic for confidence, eventually underutilizing the
information of the probability distribution. Toward effective incorporation of
the confidence of the model, in this paper, we present **top-H** decoding. We
first establish the theoretical foundation of the interplay between creativity
and coherence in truncated sampling by formulating an **entropy-constrained
minimum divergence** problem. We then prove this minimization problem to be
equivalent to an **entropy-constrained mass maximization** (ECMM) problem,
which is NP-hard. Finally, we present top-H decoding, a computationally
efficient greedy algorithm to solve the ECMM problem. Extensive empirical
evaluations demonstrate that top-H outperforms the state-of-the-art (SoTA)
alternative of min-\$p\$ sampling by up to **25.63%** on creative writing
benchmarks, while maintaining robustness on question-answering datasets such as
GPQA, GSM8K, and MT-Bench. Additionally, an *LLM-as-judge* evaluation confirms
that top-H indeed produces coherent outputs even at higher temperatures, where
creativity is especially critical. In summary, top-H advances SoTA in
open-ended text generation and can be *easily integrated* into creative writing
applications. The code is available at
https://github.com/ErfanBaghaei/Top-H-Decoding.

Motivation: 代码混合文本（特别是印地语-英语混合文本）的命名实体识别面临非正式结构、音译和频繁语言切换等独特挑战，需要评估不同模型在此任务上的有效性。

Conclusion: 专业化的代码混合预训练模型在代码混合命名实体识别任务中优于通用模型，但现代大语言模型也显示出强大的泛化能力，为代码混合NLP任务提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) in code-mixed text, particularly Hindi-English
(Hinglish), presents unique challenges due to informal structure,
transliteration, and frequent language switching. This study conducts a
comparative evaluation of code-mixed fine-tuned models and non-code-mixed
multilingual models, along with zero-shot generative large language models
(LLMs). Specifically, we evaluate HingBERT, HingMBERT, and HingRoBERTa (trained
on code-mixed data), and BERT Base Cased, IndicBERT, RoBERTa and MuRIL (trained
on non-code-mixed multilingual data). We also assess the performance of Google
Gemini in a zero-shot setting using a modified version of the dataset with NER
tags removed. All models are tested on a benchmark Hinglish NER dataset using
Precision, Recall, and F1-score. Results show that code-mixed models,
particularly HingRoBERTa and HingBERT-based fine-tuned models, outperform
others - including closed-source LLMs like Google Gemini - due to
domain-specific pretraining. Non-code-mixed models perform reasonably but show
limited adaptability. Notably, Google Gemini exhibits competitive zero-shot
performance, underlining the generalization strength of modern LLMs. This study
provides key insights into the effectiveness of specialized versus generalized
models for code-mixed NER tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have
empowered large language models (LLMs) to tackle challenging reasoning tasks
such as mathematics and programming. RLVR leverages verifiable outcome rewards
to guide policy optimization, enabling LLMs to progressively improve output
quality in a grounded and reliable manner. Despite its promise, the RLVR
paradigm poses significant challenges, as existing methods often suffer from
sparse reward signals and unstable policy gradient updates, particularly in
RL-based approaches. To address the challenges, we propose $\textbf{PACS}$, a
novel RLVR framework that achieves im$\textbf{P}$licit $\textbf{A}$ctor
$\textbf{C}$ritic coupling via a $\textbf{S}$upervised learning framework. By
treating the outcome reward as a predictable label, we reformulate the RLVR
problem into a supervised learning task over a score function parameterized by
the policy model and optimized using cross-entropy loss. A detailed gradient
analysis shows that this supervised formulation inherently recovers the
classical policy gradient update while implicitly coupling actor and critic
roles, yielding more stable and efficient training. Benchmarking on challenging
mathematical reasoning tasks, PACS outperforms strong RLVR baselines, such as
PPO and GRPO, achieving superior reasoning performance. For instance, PACS
achieves 59.78\% at pass@256 on AIME 2025, representing improvements of 13.32
and 14.36 points over PPO and GRPO. This simple yet powerful framework offers a
promising avenue for LLMs post-training with verifiable rewards. Our code and
data are available as open source at https://github.com/ritzz-ai/PACS.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战多语言ASR模型优于单语言模型的传统认知，证明对于小规模模型，精心设计的单语言训练可以获得更好的性能，特别是在资源稀缺语言上。

Method: 使用27M参数的小型模型，在精心平衡的高质量人类标注、伪标注和合成数据混合上进行单语言训练。

Result: 平均错误率比同等大小的Whisper Tiny低48%，性能超越9倍大的Whisper Small，在大多数情况下匹配或超越28倍大的Whisper Medium。

Conclusion: 为小规模模型设定了新的性能标准，使设备端ASR能够准确支持先前有限的语言，发布了6种语言的开放源代码模型。

Abstract: We present the Flavors of Moonshine, a suite of tiny automatic speech
recognition (ASR) models specialized for a range of underrepresented languages.
Prevailing wisdom suggests that multilingual ASR models outperform monolingual
counterparts by exploiting cross-lingual phonetic similarities. We challenge
this assumption, showing that for sufficiently small models (27M parameters),
training monolingual systems on a carefully balanced mix of high-quality
human-labeled, pseudo-labeled, and synthetic data yields substantially superior
performance. On average, our models achieve error rates 48% lower than the
comparably sized Whisper Tiny model, outperform the 9x larger Whisper Small
model, and in most cases match or outperform the 28x larger Whisper Medium
model. These results advance the state of the art for models of this size,
enabling accurate on-device ASR for languages that previously had limited
support. We release Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Ukrainian, and
Vietnamese Moonshine models under a permissive open-source license.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DARLING框架通过联合优化响应质量和语义多样性，解决了大语言模型后训练中准确性与多样性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型后训练往往过分追求准确性和帮助性，导致输出分布过于集中，限制了模型在创意性任务中的表现，需要平衡质量与多样性。

Method: 提出多样性感知强化学习(DARLING)框架，通过学习的分区函数测量语义多样性，将多样性信号与质量奖励结合进行在线强化学习。

Result: 在非可验证任务(指令跟随和创意写作)和可验证任务(竞赛数学)上均表现出色，生成更高质量和更新颖的输出，同时提高了解决方案质量和多样性。

Conclusion: 显式优化多样性能够催化在线强化学习的探索过程，从而产生更高质量的响应，证明了质量与多样性可以协同优化。

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LMs) often prioritizes accuracy and
helpfulness at the expense of diversity. This creates a tension: while
post-training improves response quality, it also sharpens output distributions
and reduces the range of ideas, limiting the usefulness of LMs in creative and
exploratory tasks such as brainstorming, storytelling, or problem solving. We
address this challenge with Diversity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (DARLING), a
framework that jointly optimizes for response quality and semantic diversity.
At its core, DARLING introduces a learned partition function to measure
diversity beyond surface-level lexical variations. This diversity signal is
then combined with a quality reward during online reinforcement learning,
encouraging models to generate outputs that are both high-quality and distinct.
Experiments across multiple model families and sizes show that DARLING
generalizes to two regimes: non-verifiable tasks (instruction following and
creative writing) and verifiable tasks (competition math). On five benchmarks
in the first setting, DARLING consistently outperforms quality-only RL
baselines, producing outputs that are simultaneously of higher quality and
novelty. In the second setting, DARLING achieves higher pass@1 (solution
quality) and pass@k (solution variety). Most strikingly, explicitly optimizing
for diversity catalyzes exploration in online RL, which manifests itself as
higher-quality responses.

TL;DR: PalmX 2025是首个针对LLMs在阿拉伯和伊斯兰文化领域文化能力的基准测试，包含两个子任务，结果显示任务特定微调显著提升模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs主要基于西方高资源语言数据训练，对阿拉伯和伊斯兰文化的理解存在明显不足，需要专门的基准测试来评估和改进模型的文化能力

Method: 设计包含两个子任务的共享任务：通用阿拉伯文化和通用伊斯兰文化，采用阿拉伯语多选题形式，覆盖22个阿拉伯国家的广泛主题

Result: 26个团队注册参与，任务特定微调显著提升性能，最佳系统在文化问题上达到72.15%准确率，伊斯兰知识达到84.22%，参数高效微调是最有效方法

Conclusion: LLMs在阿拉伯和伊斯兰文化理解方面存在明显差距，任务特定微调是提升文化能力的有效方法，数据增强的效果具有领域依赖性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently reflect the vast data distributions
they encounter during their pre-training phase. As this data is predominantly
sourced from the web, there is a high chance it will be skewed towards
high-resourced languages and cultures, such as those of the West. Consequently,
LLMs often exhibit a diminished understanding of certain communities, a gap
that is particularly evident in their knowledge of Arabic and Islamic cultures.
This issue becomes even more pronounced with increasingly under-represented
topics. To address this critical challenge, we introduce PalmX 2025, the first
shared task designed to benchmark the cultural competence of LLMs in these
specific domains. The task is composed of two subtasks featuring
multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA): General
Arabic Culture and General Islamic Culture. These subtasks cover a wide range
of topics, including traditions, food, history, religious practices, and
language expressions from across 22 Arab countries. The initiative drew
considerable interest, with 26 teams registering for Subtask 1 and 19 for
Subtask 2, culminating in nine and six valid submissions, respectively. Our
findings reveal that task-specific fine-tuning substantially boosts performance
over baseline models. The top-performing systems achieved an accuracy of 72.15%
on cultural questions and 84.22% on Islamic knowledge. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning emerged as the predominant and most effective approach among
participants, while the utility of data augmentation was found to be
domain-dependent.

Conclusion: AMMKD框架有效解决了移动设备部署问题，验证了其有效性和灵活性

Abstract: The success of large-scale visual language pretraining (VLP) models has
driven widespread adoption of image-text retrieval tasks. However, their
deployment on mobile devices remains limited due to large model sizes and
computational complexity. We propose Adaptive Multi-Modal Multi-Teacher
Knowledge Distillation (AMMKD), a novel framework that integrates multi-modal
feature fusion, multi-teacher distillation, and adaptive optimization to
deliver lightweight yet effective retrieval models. Specifically, our method
begins with a feature fusion network that extracts and merges discriminative
features from both the image and text modalities. To reduce model parameters
and further improve performance, we design a multi-teacher knowledge
distillation framework to pre-train two CLIP teacher models. We decouple
modalities by pre-computing and storing text features as class vectors via the
teacher text encoder to enhance efficiency. To better align teacher and student
outputs, we apply KL scatter for probability distribution matching. Finally, we
design an adaptive dynamic weighting scheme that treats multi-teacher
distillation as a multi-objective optimization problem. By leveraging gradient
space diversity, we dynamically adjust the influence of each teacher, reducing
conflicts and guiding the student toward more optimal learning directions.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMMKD
achieves superior performance while significantly reducing model complexity,
validating its effectiveness and flexibility.

Abstract: This work focuses on the high carbon emissions generated by deep learning
model training, specifically addressing the core challenge of balancing
algorithm performance and energy consumption. It proposes an innovative
two-dimensional sustainability evaluation system. Different from the
traditional single performance-oriented evaluation paradigm, this study
pioneered two quantitative indicators that integrate energy efficiency ratio
and accuracy: the sustainable harmonic mean (FMS) integrates accumulated energy
consumption and performance parameters through the harmonic mean to reveal the
algorithm performance under unit energy consumption; the area under the
sustainability curve (ASC) constructs a performance-power consumption curve to
characterize the energy efficiency characteristics of the algorithm throughout
the cycle. To verify the universality of the indicator system, the study
constructed benchmarks in various multimodal tasks, including image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and batch and online learning.
Experiments demonstrate that the system can provide a quantitative basis for
evaluating cross-task algorithms and promote the transition of green AI
research from theory to practice. Our sustainability evaluation framework code
can be found here, providing methodological support for the industry to
establish algorithm energy efficiency standards.

Motivation: 微表情识别面临挑战，因为微表情细微而瞬息。传统输入模态如Apex Frame、光流和动态图像无法充分抓取这些短暂面部运动，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出MESTI微表情时空图像转换方法，将视频序列转换为单张图像同时保留微运动特征。设计MEGANet网络，集成梯度注意力块来提取细粒度运动特征。

Result: 在VGG19、ResNet50和EfficientNetB0三种CNN架构上，MESTI都显著超过现有输入模态。MEGANet网络配合MESTI在CASMEII和SAMM数据集上达到了目前最高的识别精度，创造了新的标杆结果。

Conclusion: MESTI作为优秀的输入模态和MEGANet作为先进的识别网络，为微表情识别领域开启了更有效的解决方案，在多种应用场景中具有广阔前景。

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task due to the subtle
and fleeting nature of micro-expressions. Traditional input modalities, such as
Apex Frame, Optical Flow, and Dynamic Image, often fail to adequately capture
these brief facial movements, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this
study, we introduce the Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image (MESTI), a novel
dynamic input modality that transforms a video sequence into a single image
while preserving the essential characteristics of micro-movements.
Additionally, we present the Micro-expression Gradient Attention Network
(MEGANet), which incorporates a novel Gradient Attention block to enhance the
extraction of fine-grained motion features from micro-expressions. By combining
MESTI and MEGANet, we aim to establish a more effective approach to MER.
Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MESTI,
comparing it with existing input modalities across three CNN architectures
(VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0). Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing
the input of previously published MER networks with MESTI leads to consistent
performance improvements. The performance of MEGANet, both with MESTI and
Dynamic Image, is also evaluated, showing that our proposed network achieves
state-of-the-art results on the CASMEII and SAMM datasets. The combination of
MEGANet and MESTI achieves the highest accuracy reported to date, setting a new
benchmark for micro-expression recognition. These findings underscore the
potential of MESTI as a superior input modality and MEGANet as an advanced
recognition network, paving the way for more effective MER systems in a variety
of applications.

Conclusion: 离散扩散是3D稀疏体素生成建模的有前景框架，为处理高稀疏度3D结构生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating realistic sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures is difficult
due to the cubic memory scaling of voxel structures and moreover the
significant class imbalance caused by sparsity. We introduce Scaffold
Diffusion, a generative model designed for sparse multi-category 3D voxel
structures. By treating voxels as tokens, Scaffold Diffusion uses a discrete
diffusion language model to generate 3D voxel structures. We show that discrete
diffusion language models can be extended beyond inherently sequential domains
such as text to generate spatially coherent 3D structures. We evaluate on
Minecraft house structures from the 3D-Craft dataset and demonstrate that,
unlike prior baselines and an auto-regressive formulation, Scaffold Diffusion
produces realistic and coherent structures even when trained on data with over
98% sparsity. We provide an interactive viewer where readers can visualize
generated samples and the generation process. Our results highlight discrete
diffusion as a promising framework for 3D sparse voxel generative modeling.

TL;DR: 提出SGLC框架解决高分辨率图像去雾问题，通过全局特征生成器和局部特征增强器的组合，在保持全局上下文的同时增强局部细节，显著提升PSNR指标


<details>

Motivation: 现有去雾模型主要针对低分辨率图像，高分辨率图像处理时通常需要降采样或分块处理，导致性能下降，需要解决全局上下文与局部细节的有效结合问题

Method: SGLC框架包含两个组件：全局特征生成器(GFG)产生初步去雾结果，局部特征增强器(LFE)细化局部细节和像素级特征，可集成到现有去雾网络中

Result: 在高分辨率数据集上实验显示，SGLC显著提升了峰值信噪比(PSNR)，表明其在大规模雾化图像处理中的有效性

Conclusion: SGLC是模型无关的框架，能够增强任何去雾网络的全局-局部特征融合能力，同时利用场景级线索和细节信息，显著提高高分辨率环境下的视觉保真度

Abstract: Addressing the challenge of removing atmospheric fog or haze from digital
images, known as image dehazing, has recently gained significant traction in
the computer vision community. Although contemporary dehazing models have
demonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated
high-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to
downsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads
to a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the
difficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with
localized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this
chapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local
Features Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for
high-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:
the Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The
GFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual
understanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary
output by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby
capturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To
evaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer
architecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on
high-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in
addressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is
model-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed
global-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners
can harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving
visual fidelity in high-resolution environments.

Abstract: Kidney abnormality detection is required for all preclinical drug
development. It involves a time-consuming and costly examination of hundreds to
thousands of whole-slide images per drug safety study, most of which are
normal, to detect any subtle changes indicating toxic effects. In this study,
we present the first large-scale self-supervised abnormality detection model
for kidney toxicologic pathology, spanning drug safety assessment studies from
158 compounds. We explore the complexity of kidney abnormality detection on
this scale using features extracted from the UNI foundation model (FM) and show
that a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at
chance, demonstrating that the FM-generated features alone are insufficient for
detecting abnormalities. We then demonstrate that a self-supervised method
applied to the same features can achieve better-than-chance performance, with
an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a
negative predictive value of 89%. With further development, such a model can be
used to rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment studies, reducing the
costs and time associated with drug development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然像CLIP这样的视觉-语言模型提供了开放词汇的解决方案，但它们将文本和图像映射到表征空间中相远的区域，限制了检索性能。需要缩小文本与图像模态间的表征间距。

Method: 提出两步方法：首先使用生成式滴流模型将文本查询转换为视觉查询，然后使用视觉模型估计图像到图像的相似性。还包含一个聚合网络，将多个生成图像聚合成单个向量表征，并融合两种查询模态的相似性分数。

Result: 经过大量评估显示，该方法在文本到图像检索任务中持续地超越仅依靠文本查询的检索方法，显著提升了检索性能。

Conclusion: 通过利用生成式模型将文本查询转换为视觉表征，再统一通过视觉模型进行检索，有效缩小了文本与图像模态间的表征间距，为文本到图像检索提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This work explores text-to-image retrieval for queries that specify or
describe a semantic category. While vision-and-language models (VLMs) like CLIP
offer a straightforward open-vocabulary solution, they map text and images to
distant regions in the representation space, limiting retrieval performance. To
bridge this modality gap, we propose a two-step approach. First, we transform
the text query into a visual query using a generative diffusion model. Then, we
estimate image-to-image similarity with a vision model. Additionally, we
introduce an aggregation network that combines multiple generated images into a
single vector representation and fuses similarity scores across both query
modalities. Our approach leverages advancements in vision encoders, VLMs, and
text-to-image generation models. Extensive evaluations show that it
consistently outperforms retrieval methods relying solely on text queries.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了PRISM基准测试和Safe-LLaVA数据集，用于评估和减少多模态大语言模型中的生物特征信息泄露问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理视觉语言任务时，即使未被明确要求，也会推断并泄露敏感的生物特征信息（如种族、性别、年龄等），这在现实应用和社会敏感领域存在严重隐私风险。目前缺乏公开的数据集和基准来全面评估和缓解这一问题。

Method: 1) 引入PRISM基准测试，评估模型在两个方面：拒绝生物特征相关查询和在一般响应中避免隐含生物特征泄露；2) 对LLaVA数据集进行详细审计，发现广泛存在的生物特征泄露；3) 构建Safe-LLaVA数据集，通过系统性地移除LLaVA数据集中的显性和隐性生物特征信息。

Result: 评估显示不同MLLMs模型在各种生物特征属性上都存在泄露问题。在Safe-LLaVA数据集上微调的模型显著减少了生物特征泄露。

Conclusion: Safe-LLaVA和PRISM为隐私对齐的MLLMs开发和评估设立了新标准，提供了首个隐私保护的多模态训练数据集和全面的评估基准。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language tasks. However, these models often infer and
reveal sensitive biometric attributes - such as race, gender, age, body weight,
and eye color - even when such information is not explicitly requested. This
raises critical concerns, particularly in real-world applications and
socially-sensitive domains. Despite increasing awareness, no publicly available
dataset or benchmark exists to comprehensively evaluate or mitigate biometric
leakage in MLLMs. To address this gap, we introduce PRISM (Privacy-aware
Evaluation of Responses in Sensitive Modalities), a new benchmark designed to
assess MLLMs on two fronts: (1) refuse biometric-related queries and (2)
implicit biometric leakage in general responses while maintaining semantic
faithfulness. Further, we conduct a detailed audit of the widely used LLaVA
datasets and uncover extensive biometric leakage across pretraining and
instruction data. To address this, we present Safe-LLaVA dataset, the first
privacy-preserving MLLM training dataset constructed by systematically removing
explicit and implicit biometric information from LLaVA dataset. Our evaluations
on PRISM reveal biometric leakages across MLLMs for different attributes,
highlighting the detailed privacy-violations. We also fine-tune a model on
Safe-LLaVA dataset and show that it substantially reduces the biometric
leakages. Together, Safe-LLaVA & PRISM set a new standard for privacy-aligned
development and evaluation of MLLMs. The Safe-LLaVA dataset & PRISM benchmark
are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/kyh9191/Safe-LLaVA,
and the source code is available at

TL;DR: VEME是一种新颖的跨模态对齐方法，通过构建自我中心的世界模型来增强视觉语言模型在动态环境中的时空推理和泛化能力，在导航和问答任务上比传统方法提升1%-3%的准确率和探索效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在静态场景理解表现出色，但在动态开放环境中的时空推理和适应性方面存在局限，特别是在任务导向导航和具身问答等任务中，缺乏对细粒度时空线索和物理世界理解的建模。

Method: 提出VEME框架，包含三个核心组件：(1)跨模态对齐框架，连接对象、空间表征和视觉语义与时空线索；(2)动态隐式认知地图，通过世界嵌入激活任务相关的几何语义记忆召回；(3)基于指令的导航推理框架，利用具身先验进行长期规划和高效探索。

Result: 在VSI-Bench和VLN-CE基准测试中，相比传统方法实现了1%-3%的准确率和探索效率提升，显著改善了动态环境中的推理和规划能力。

Conclusion: 通过嵌入几何感知的时空经验，VEME方法有效增强了视觉语言模型在未知动态环境中的泛化能力和推理性能，为具身智能的发展提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Achieving human-like reasoning in deep learning models for complex tasks in
unknown environments remains a critical challenge in embodied intelligence.
While advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in static scene
understanding, their limitations in spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to
dynamic, open-set tasks like task-oriented navigation and embodied question
answering (EQA) persist due to inadequate modeling of fine-grained
spatio-temporal cues and physical world comprehension. To address this, we
propose VEME, a novel cross-modal alignment method that enhances generalization
in unseen scenes by learning an ego-centric, experience-centered world model.
Our framework integrates three key components: (1) a cross-modal alignment
framework bridging objects, spatial representations, and visual semantics with
spatio-temporal cues to enhance VLM in-context learning; (2) a dynamic,
implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding to enable task-relevant
geometric-semantic memory recall; and (3) an instruction-based navigation and
reasoning framework leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning and
efficient exploration. By embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic
experiences, our method significantly improves reasoning and planning in
dynamic environments. Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE demonstrate
1%-3% accuracy and exploration efficiency improvement compared to traditional
approaches.

TL;DR: 提出多模态深度学习框架，结合乳腺超声图像和临床数据，提高叶状肿瘤分类准确率，减少不必要的手术切除。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 叶状肿瘤在影像学上与良性纤维腺瘤相似，术前分类困难，常导致不必要的手术切除，需要开发更准确的诊断方法。

Method: 开发双分支神经网络，从81例确诊患者的超声图像和临床数据中提取并融合特征，采用类别感知采样和分层交叉验证防止数据偏差。

Result: 多模态方法优于单模态基准，ConvNeXt和ResNet18表现最佳，AUC-ROC分别达0.9427和0.9349，F1分数分别为0.6720和0.7294。

Conclusion: 多模态AI有潜力作为非侵入性诊断工具，减少不必要活检，改善乳腺肿瘤管理的临床决策。

Abstract: Phyllodes tumors (PTs) are rare fibroepithelial breast lesions that are
difficult to classify preoperatively due to their radiological similarity to
benign fibroadenomas. This often leads to unnecessary surgical excisions. To
address this, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates
breast ultrasound (BUS) images with structured clinical data to improve
diagnostic accuracy. We developed a dual-branch neural network that extracts
and fuses features from ultrasound images and patient metadata from 81 subjects
with confirmed PTs. Class-aware sampling and subject-stratified 5-fold
cross-validation were applied to prevent class imbalance and data leakage. The
results show that our proposed multimodal method outperforms unimodal baselines
in classifying benign versus borderline/malignant PTs. Among six image
encoders, ConvNeXt and ResNet18 achieved the best performance in the multimodal
setting, with AUC-ROC scores of 0.9427 and 0.9349, and F1-scores of 0.6720 and
0.7294, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal AI to
serve as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, reducing unnecessary biopsies and
improving clinical decision-making in breast tumor management.

Abstract: Gravitational lensing offers a powerful probe into the properties of dark
matter and is crucial to infer cosmological parameters. The Legacy Survey of
Space and Time (LSST) is predicted to find O(10^5) gravitational lenses over
the next decade, demanding automated classifiers. In this work, we introduce
GraViT, a PyTorch pipeline for gravitational lens detection that leverages
extensive pretraining of state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) models and
MLP-Mixer. We assess the impact of transfer learning on classification
performance by examining data quality (source and sample size), model
architecture (selection and fine-tuning), training strategies (augmentation,
normalization, and optimization), and ensemble predictions. This study
reproduces the experiments in a previous systematic comparison of neural
networks and provides insights into the detectability of strong gravitational
lenses on that common test sample. We fine-tune ten architectures using

convolutional baselines, discussing complexity and inference-time analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FHT2SP算法，在保持常数有界误差的同时实现接近最优的计算复杂度O(wh ln³ w)，解决了传统快速Hough变换算法在精度和效率之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统快速Hough变换算法存在精度与计算效率的权衡：FHT算法具有最优线性复杂度但精度随尺度恶化，而精确HT算法虽有常数有界误差但计算成本接近立方级。需要开发既能保持高精度又具有高效计算复杂度的算法。

Method: 基于Brady的超像素概念，将其扩展到任意形状（超越原始2的幂次方约束），并将其集成到FHT2DT算法中。通过适当选择超像素大小，实现算法优化。

Result: FHT2SP算法对于w×h图像，达到接近最优的计算复杂度O(wh ln³ w)，同时保持与图像大小无关的常数有界近似误差，且可通过元参数控制误差。

Conclusion: FHT2SP算法成功解决了Hough变换中精度与效率的长期权衡问题，提供了理论分析和实验验证，证明了其在计算复杂度和精度方面的优越性能。

Abstract: The Hough transform (HT) is a fundamental tool across various domains, from
classical image analysis to neural networks and tomography. Two key aspects of
the algorithms for computing the HT are their computational complexity and
accuracy - the latter often defined as the error of approximation of continuous
lines by discrete ones within the image region. The fast HT (FHT) algorithms
with optimal linearithmic complexity - such as the Brady-Yong algorithm for
power-of-two-sized images - are well established. Generalizations like $FHT2DT$
extend this efficiency to arbitrary image sizes, but with reduced accuracy that
worsens with scale. Conversely, accurate HT algorithms achieve constant-bounded
error but require near-cubic computational cost. This paper introduces $FHT2SP$
algorithm - a fast and highly accurate HT algorithm. It builds on our
development of Brady's superpixel concept, extending it to arbitrary shapes
beyond the original power-of-two square constraint, and integrates it into the
$FHT2DT$ algorithm. With an appropriate choice of the superpixel's size, for an
image of shape $w \times h$, the $FHT2SP$ algorithm achieves near-optimal
computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(wh \ln^3 w)$, while keeping the
approximation error bounded by a constant independent of image size, and
controllable via a meta-parameter. We provide theoretical and experimental
analyses of the algorithm's complexity and accuracy.

Conclusion: 视觉-语言模型导向的生成式工作流有势推进工业计算机视觉技术，超越传统管道的限制。

Abstract: Industrial computer vision systems often struggle with noise, material
variability, and uncontrolled imaging conditions, limiting the effectiveness of
classical edge detectors and handcrafted pipelines. In this work, we present a
language-guided generative vision system for remnant contour detection in
manufacturing, designed to achieve CAD-level precision. The system is organized
into three stages: data acquisition and preprocessing, contour generation using
a conditional GAN, and multimodal contour refinement through vision-language
modeling, where standardized prompts are crafted in a human-in-the-loop process
and applied through image-text guided synthesis. On proprietary FabTrack
datasets, the proposed system improved contour fidelity, enhancing edge
continuity and geometric alignment while reducing manual tracing. For the
refinement stage, we benchmarked several vision-language models, including
Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash, OpenAI's GPT-image-1 integrated within a VLM-guided
workflow, and open-source baselines. Under standardized conditions, GPT-image-1
consistently outperformed Gemini 2.0 Flash in both structural accuracy and
perceptual quality. These findings demonstrate the promise of VLM-guided
generative workflows for advancing industrial computer vision beyond the
limitations of classical pipelines.

Conclusion: 该研究证明了信息论概念和PEFT技术在转导式少样本学习中的效果，为基础视觉-语言模型的转导学习提供了新的研究方向和方法。

Abstract: Transductive few-shot learning has triggered an abundant literature focusing
on vision-only models, but is still at a nascent stage within the recent
context of foundational vision-language models (VLMs). Only a few recent
methods addressed the problem, pointing to the potential of tranduction in VLMs
and to the need for VLM-tailored methods. Building on this momentum, we
leverage information-theoretic concepts and recent progress in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), developing a highly competitive
transductive few-shot CLIP method. Specifically, we introduce a novel
Language-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO) loss integrating three
complementary terms: (i) the mutual information between the vision inputs and
the textual class descriptions; (ii) a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
penalizing deviation of the network's probabilistic outputs from the
text-driven zero-shot predictions; and (iii) a standard cross-entropy loss
based on the labeled shots. Furthermore, we challenge the commonly followed
fine-tuning practices in the context of transductive few-shot learning, and
explore PEFT strategies, completely overlooked in this context. Surprisingly,
we observe substantial boosts in performances, which points to the potential of
adapting a subset of the model's parameters in the transductive few-shot
setting. We report comprehensive evaluations, which show that LIMO outperforms
the very recent transductive few-shot CLIP methods by a large margin and yields
significant gains over the best-performing inductive methods. Our code is

TL;DR: MorphGen是一个通过显式建模核形态和空间组织来提高组织病理学图像领域泛化能力的方法，结合对比学习和随机权重平均技术


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织病理学全切片图像存在机构间的异质性（组织制备、染色、成像条件差异），而病理学家依赖领域不变的形态学特征进行诊断，因此需要学习对领域偏移具有鲁棒性的癌症表示

Method: 提出MorphGen方法，在监督对比学习框架中整合组织病理学图像、增强和核分割掩码，通过对齐图像和核掩码的潜在表示来优先考虑诊断特征，并加入随机权重平均(SWA)增强分布外鲁棒性

Result: 注意力图分析显示MorphGen主要依赖核形态、细胞组成和空间细胞组织进行分类，学习到的表示对图像损坏和对抗攻击具有韧性

Conclusion: 该方法不仅实现了分布外泛化，还解决了当前数字病理深度学习系统的关键脆弱性，代码和模型已开源

Abstract: Domain generalization in computational histopathology is hindered by
heterogeneity in whole slide images (WSIs), caused by variations in tissue
preparation, staining, and imaging conditions across institutions. Unlike
machine learning systems, pathologists rely on domain-invariant morphological
cues such as nuclear atypia (enlargement, irregular contours, hyperchromasia,
chromatin texture, spatial disorganization), structural atypia (abnormal
architecture and gland formation), and overall morphological atypia that remain
diagnostic across diverse settings. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that
explicitly modeling biologically robust nuclear morphology and spatial
organization will enable the learning of cancer representations that are
resilient to domain shifts. We propose MorphGen (Morphology-Guided
Generalization), a method that integrates histopathology images, augmentations,
and nuclear segmentation masks within a supervised contrastive learning
framework. By aligning latent representations of images and nuclear masks,
MorphGen prioritizes diagnostic features such as nuclear and morphological
atypia and spatial organization over staining artifacts and domain-specific
features. To further enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate
stochastic weight averaging (SWA), steering optimization toward flatter minima.
Attention map analyses revealed that MorphGen primarily relies on nuclear
morphology, cellular composition, and spatial cell organization within tumors
or normal regions for final classification. Finally, we demonstrate resilience
of the learned representations to image corruptions (such as staining
artifacts) and adversarial attacks, showcasing not only OOD generalization but
also addressing critical vulnerabilities in current deep learning systems for
digital pathology. Code, datasets, and trained models are available at:

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B和LLaVA-NEXT-7B等模型上，方法能够减少88.9%的到床数量，同时保持强劲的性能表现，实现了推理速度56.7%的提升。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的视觉到床剪枝策略有效地减少了大型多模态模型的计算资源消耗，通过保持跨模态对齐和模态内信息多样性，在显著提升效率的同时维持了模型性能。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved significant success across
various tasks. These models usually encode visual inputs into dense token
sequences, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly
processed by a language model. However, the increased token count substantially
raises computational and memory costs during inference. Token pruning has
emerged as a promising approach to address this issue. Existing token pruning
methods often rely on costly calibration or suboptimal importance metrics,
leading to redundant retained tokens. In this paper, we analyze the redundancy
differences between visual and textual tokens and propose pruning exclusively
on visual tokens. Based on this, we propose a visual token pruning strategy
that explicitly preserves both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal
informational diversity. We introduce a mutual information-based token pruning
strategy that removes visual tokens semantically misaligned with textual
tokens, effectively preserving the alignment between the visual and textual
modalities. To further improve the representational quality of the retained
tokens, we additionally prune redundant visual tokens by maximizing the
expected pairwise distances in the embedding space, which is solved efficiently
with a greedy algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
maintains strong performance while reducing tokens by 88.9% on models such as
LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B, resulting in a 56.7% improvement in inference
speed.

Abstract: Face recognition is central to many authentication, security, and
personalized applications. Yet, it suffers from significant privacy risks,
particularly arising from unauthorized access to sensitive biometric data. This
paper introduces CryptoFace, the first end-to-end encrypted face recognition
system with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). It enables secure processing of
facial data across all stages of a face-recognition process--feature
extraction, storage, and matching--without exposing raw images or features. We
introduce a mixture of shallow patch convolutional networks to support
higher-dimensional tensors via patch-based processing while reducing the
multiplicative depth and, thus, inference latency. Parallel FHE evaluation of
these networks ensures near-resolution-independent latency. On standard face
recognition benchmarks, CryptoFace significantly accelerates inference and
increases verification accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art FHE neural
networks adapted for face recognition. CryptoFace will facilitate secure face
recognition systems requiring robust and provable security. The code is

Abstract: Current advanced research on infrared and visible image fusion primarily
focuses on improving fusion performance, often neglecting the applicability on
real-time fusion devices. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
towards extremely fast fusion via distillation to learnable lookup tables
specifically designed for image fusion, termed as LUT-Fuse. Firstly, we develop
a look-up table structure that utilizing low-order approximation encoding and
high-level joint contextual scene encoding, which is well-suited for
multi-modal fusion. Moreover, given the lack of ground truth in multi-modal
image fusion, we naturally proposed the efficient LUT distillation strategy
instead of traditional quantization LUT methods. By integrating the performance
of the multi-modal fusion network (MM-Net) into the MM-LUT model, our method
achieves significant breakthroughs in efficiency and performance. It typically
requires less than one-tenth of the time compared to the current lightweight
SOTA fusion algorithms, ensuring high operational speed across various
scenarios, even in low-power mobile devices. Extensive experiments validate the
superiority, reliability, and stability of our fusion approach. The code is

Motivation: 现有的单域普适方法通常关注于扩充源数据或学习不变特征，忽视了一个可用的资源：目标部署环境的文本描述。这些文本描述在实际应用中往往可以获得，但被忽略了。

Method: 提出STAR(Spectral TARget Alignment)方法：1)使用目标描述的文本嵌入构建目标锚定子空间；2)重心化图像特征向部署域方向；3)利用谱投影保留与目标线索对齐的方向，并丢弃源域特定噪音；4)使用视觉-语言蓄粉对齐背榜特征与VLM的语义几何；5)使用特征空间Mixup确保源域和目标导向表征之间的平滑迁移。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明，最小化的文本元数据（这是一种实用但往往被忽视的资源）能够在严重的数据约束下显著提升模型的普适化能力，为在目标环境中部署稳健模型打开了新的途径。

Abstract: Deep models trained on a single source domain often fail catastrophically
under distribution shifts, a critical challenge in Single Domain Generalization
(SDG). While existing methods focus on augmenting source data or learning
invariant features, they neglect a readily available resource: textual
descriptions of the target deployment environment. We propose Target-Oriented
Single Domain Generalization (TO-SDG), a novel problem setup that leverages the
textual description of the target domain, without requiring any target data, to
guide model generalization. To address TO-SDG, we introduce Spectral TARget
Alignment (STAR), a lightweight module that injects target semantics into
source features by exploiting visual-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP. STAR
uses a target-anchored subspace derived from the text embedding of the target
description to recenter image features toward the deployment domain, then
utilizes spectral projection to retain directions aligned with target cues
while discarding source-specific noise. Moreover, we use a vision-language
distillation to align backbone features with VLM's semantic geometry. STAR
further employs feature-space Mixup to ensure smooth transitions between source
and target-oriented representations. Experiments across various image
classification and object detection benchmarks demonstrate STAR's superiority.
This work establishes that minimal textual metadata, which is a practical and
often overlooked resource, significantly enhances generalization under severe
data constraints, opening new avenues for deploying robust models in target
environments with unseen data.

Conclusion: ILRNet通过有效整合物理先验和数据驱动学习，为HSI去噪提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial preprocessing step for
subsequent tasks. The clean HSI usually reside in a low-dimensional subspace,
which can be captured by low-rank and sparse representation, known as the
physical prior of HSI. It is generally challenging to adequately use such
physical properties for effective denoising while preserving image details.
This paper introduces a novel iterative low-rank network (ILRNet) to address
these challenges. ILRNet integrates the strengths of model-driven and
data-driven approaches by embedding a rank minimization module (RMM) within a
U-Net architecture. This module transforms feature maps into the wavelet domain
and applies singular value thresholding (SVT) to the low-frequency components
during the forward pass, leveraging the spectral low-rankness of HSIs in the
feature domain. The parameter, closely related to the hyperparameter of the
singular vector thresholding algorithm, is adaptively learned from the data,
allowing for flexible and effective capture of low-rankness across different
scenarios. Additionally, ILRNet features an iterative refinement process that
adaptively combines intermediate denoised HSIs with noisy inputs. This manner
ensures progressive enhancement and superior preservation of image details.
Experimental results demonstrate that ILRNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both synthetic and real-world noise removal tasks.

TL;DR: SurgLLM是一个针对手术视频理解的大型多模态框架，通过空间感知增强和时间感知优化，在多种手术视频任务上实现显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手术视频理解研究存在两个主要局限：视觉内容感知不足和时间意识不够，这阻碍了多功能计算机辅助手术系统的发展

Method: 提出SurgLLM框架，包含Surgical Context-aware Multimodal Pretraining（空间感知预训练）、Temporal-aware Multimodal Tuning（时间感知调优）和Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble（任务动态集成）三个核心组件

Result: 在多种手术视频理解任务（包括字幕生成、通用视觉问答和时间视觉问答）上的广泛实验显示，相比最先进方法有显著改进

Conclusion: SurgLLM框架通过增强空间焦点和时间意识，为多功能手术视频理解提供了有效的解决方案，验证了其在多样化手术视频理解任务中的有效性

Abstract: Surgical video understanding is crucial for facilitating Computer-Assisted
Surgery (CAS) systems. Despite significant progress in existing studies, two
major limitations persist, including inadequate visual content perception and
insufficient temporal awareness in surgical videos, and hinder the development
of versatile CAS solutions. In this work, we propose the SurgLLM framework, an
effective large multimodal model tailored for versatile surgical video
understanding tasks with enhanced spatial focus and temporal awareness.
Specifically, to empower the spatial focus of surgical videos, we first devise
Surgical Context-aware Multimodal Pretraining (Surg-Pretrain) for the video
encoder of SurgLLM, by performing instrument-centric Masked Video
Reconstruction (MV-Recon) and subsequent multimodal alignment. To incorporate
surgical temporal knowledge into SurgLLM, we further propose Temporal-aware
Multimodal Tuning (TM-Tuning) to enhance temporal reasoning with interleaved
multimodal embeddings. Moreover, to accommodate various understanding tasks of
surgical videos without conflicts, we devise a Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble
to efficiently triage a query with optimal learnable parameters in our SurgLLM.
Extensive experiments performed on diverse surgical video understanding tasks,
including captioning, general VQA, and temporal VQA, demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness
of our SurgLLM in versatile surgical video understanding. The source code is

Motivation: 现有方法基于错误假设，认为遗漏和虚构幻觉有共同原因，往往减少遗漏却引发更多虚构。本文旨在推翻这一观点，深入理解两种幻觉的不同成因机制。

Method: 通过视觉注意力干预实验，提出视觉语义注意力势场概念框架，并基于此开发了即插即用的视觉势场校准(VPFC)方法。

Result: VPFC方法能够有效减少遗漏幻觉，同时不会引入额外的虚构幻觉，为幻觉缓解提供了更平衡的解决方案。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前物体幻觉研究的关键疏忽，为开发更稳健和平衡的幻觉缓解策略指明了新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive advances,
yet object hallucination remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods,
based on the flawed assumption that omission and fabrication hallucinations
share a common cause, often reduce omissions only to trigger more fabrications.
In this work, we overturn this view by demonstrating that omission
hallucinations arise from insufficient confidence when mapping perceived visual
features to linguistic expressions, whereas fabrication hallucinations result
from spurious associations within the cross-modal representation space due to
statistical biases in the training corpus. Building on findings from visual
attention intervention experiments, we propose the Visual-Semantic Attention
Potential Field, a conceptual framework that reveals how the model constructs
visual evidence to infer the presence or absence of objects. Leveraging this
insight, we introduce Visual Potential Field Calibration (VPFC), a
plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that effectively reduces omission
hallucinations without introducing additional fabrication hallucinations. Our
findings reveal a critical oversight in current object hallucination research
and chart new directions for developing more robust and balanced hallucination
mitigation strategies.

TL;DR: SPO-VLM是一个针对视觉语言模型的两阶段防御框架，通过激活干预和策略优化来增强模型对抗对抗攻击的鲁棒性，同时保持视觉理解能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的激活导向防御方法依赖任务特定的对比提示来提取有害方向，性能次优且可能降低视觉接地性能，需要更有效的防御方案

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段计算自适应层特定导向向量来抑制有害行为；第二阶段通过序列级偏好优化（整合毒性评估和视觉一致性奖励）来精炼导向向量

Result: SPO-VLM通过激活导向和偏好优化显著增强了安全性，同时在良性任务上保持强劲性能且不损害视觉理解能力

Conclusion: SPO-VLM提供了一个平衡效率和有效性的防御框架，结合轻量级缓解基础和深度策略优化，为VLM安全防御提供了新思路

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
integrating visual and textual information for understanding and reasoning, but
remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While activation steering has
emerged as a promising defence, existing approaches often rely on task-specific
contrastive prompts to extract harmful directions, which exhibit suboptimal
performance and can degrade visual grounding performance. To address these
limitations, we propose \textit{Sequence-Level Preference Optimization} for VLM
(\textit{SPO-VLM}), a novel two-stage defense framework that combines
activation-level intervention with policy-level optimization to enhance model
robustness. In \textit{Stage I}, we compute adaptive layer-specific steering
vectors from diverse data sources, enabling generalized suppression of harmful
behaviors during inference. In \textit{Stage II}, we refine these steering
vectors through a sequence-level preference optimization process. This stage
integrates automated toxicity assessment, as well as visual-consistency rewards
based on caption-image alignment, to achieve safe and semantically grounded
text generation. The two-stage structure of SPO-VLM balances efficiency and
effectiveness by combining a lightweight mitigation foundation in Stage I with
deeper policy refinement in Stage II. Extensive experiments shown SPO-VLM
enhances safety against attacks via activation steering and preference
optimization, while maintaining strong performance on benign tasks without
compromising visual understanding capabilities. We will release our code, model
weights, and evaluation toolkit to support reproducibility and future research.

Conclusion: APPT为领域多样性基础模型的3D点云分析提供了一种通用化的参数效率微调方案，有效解决了异构映射导致的空间几何信息丢失问题。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for foundation models in 1D
textual and 2D visual analysis have demonstrated remarkable efficacy. However,
due to the scarcity of point cloud data, pre-training large 3D models remains a
challenging task. While many efforts have been made to apply pre-trained visual
models to 3D domains through "high-to-low" mapping, these approaches often lead
to the loss of spatial geometries and lack a generalizable framework for
adapting any modality to 3D. This paper, therefore, attempts to directly
leverage point features to calibrate the heterogeneous foundation model of any
modality for 3D point cloud analysis. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive
Point-Prompt Tuning (APPT) method, which fine-tunes pre-trained models with a
modest number of parameters, enabling direct point cloud processing without
heterogeneous mappings. We convert raw point clouds into point embeddings by
aggregating local geometry to capture spatial features followed by linear
layers to ensure seamless utilization of frozen pre-trained models. Given the
inherent disorder of point clouds, in contrast to the structured nature of
images and language, we employ a permutation-invariant feature to capture the
relative positions of point embeddings, thereby obtaining point tokens enriched
with location information to optimize self-attention mechanisms. To calibrate
self-attention across source domains of any modality to 3D and reduce
computational overhead, we introduce a prompt generator that shares weights
with the point embedding module, dynamically producing point-prompts without
adding additional parameters. These prompts are then concatenated into a frozen
foundation model, providing rich global structural information and compensating
for the lack of structural context in the heterogeneous data.

Motivation: 传统的CutMix和MixUp等多类别图像结合数据增帽方法存在边界不自然的问题，而温度模型能生成自然高分辨率图像。将两者结合可以利用温度模型的生成能力和CutMix的多样性特点。

Method: 提出NoiseCutMix方法，在温度模型的噪声估计过程中部分结合两个不同类别对应的估计噪声，从而生成具有两个类别融合特征的自然高分辨率图像。

Result: 在分类实验中，与传统多类别结合数据增帽技术、使用Stable Diffusion随机生成图像以及这些方法的组合进行了对比，验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: NoiseCutMix能够生成自然高质量的多类别融合图像，在数据增帽效果上表现优异，为深度学习数据增帽提供了一种新的有效方法。

Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation method that introduces
the concept of CutMix into the generation process of diffusion models, thereby
exploiting both the ability of diffusion models to generate natural and
high-resolution images and the characteristic of CutMix, which combines
features from two classes to create diverse augmented data. Representative data
augmentation methods for combining images from multiple classes include CutMix
and MixUp. However, techniques like CutMix often result in unnatural boundaries
between the two images due to contextual differences. Therefore, in this study,
we propose a method, called NoiseCutMix, to achieve natural, high-resolution
image generation featuring the fused characteristics of two classes by
partially combining the estimated noise corresponding to two different classes
in a diffusion model. In the classification experiments, we verified the
effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with conventional data
augmentation techniques that combine multiple classes, random image generation
using Stable Diffusion, and combinations of these methods. Our codes are

Conclusion: 提出的跨模态知识蒸馏方法能够有效利用丰富的2D图像数据来提升3D点云分割性能，无需昂贵的3D标注，为自动驾驶场景的语义分割提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR data plays a pivotal role in autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches rely on extensive annotated data for point
cloud analysis, incurring high costs and time investments. In contrast,
realworld image datasets offer abundant availability and substantial scale. To
mitigate the burden of annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds, we propose two
crossmodal knowledge distillation methods: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
Knowledge Distillation (UDAKD) and Feature and Semantic-based Knowledge
Distillation (FSKD). Leveraging readily available spatio-temporally
synchronized data from cameras and LiDARs in autonomous driving scenarios, we
directly apply a pretrained 2D image model to unlabeled 2D data. Through
crossmodal knowledge distillation with known 2D-3D correspondence, we actively
align the output of the 3D network with the corresponding points of the 2D
network, thereby obviating the necessity for 3D annotations. Our focus is on
preserving modality-general information while filtering out modality-specific
details during crossmodal distillation. To achieve this, we deploy
self-calibrated convolution on 3D point clouds as the foundation of our domain
adaptation module. Rigorous experimentation validates the effectiveness of our
proposed methods, consistently surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art
approaches in the field.

Abstract: Narrative inquiry has been one of the prominent application domains for the
analysis of human experience, aiming to know more about the complexity of human
society. However, researchers are often required to transform various forms of
data into coherent hand-drafted narratives in storied form throughout narrative
analysis, which brings an immense burden of data analysis. Participants, too,
are expected to engage in member checking and presentation of these narrative
products, which involves reviewing and responding to large volumes of
documents. Given the dual burden and the need for more efficient and
participant-friendly approaches to narrative making and representation, we made
a first attempt: (i) a new paradigm is proposed, NAME, as the initial attempt
to push the field of narrative inquiry. Name is able to transfer research
documents into coherent story images, alleviating the cognitive burden of
interpreting extensive text-based materials during member checking for both
researchers and participants. (ii) We develop an actor location and shape
module to facilitate plausible image generation. (iii) We have designed a set
of robust evaluation metrics comprising three key dimensions to objectively
measure the perceptual quality and narrative consistency of generated
characters. Our approach consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
across different data partitioning schemes. Remarkably, while the baseline
relies on the full 100% of the available data, our method requires only 0.96%
yet still reduces the FID score from 195 to 152. Under identical data volumes,
our method delivers substantial improvements: for the 70:30 split, the FID
score decreases from 175 to 152, and for the 95:5 split, it is nearly halved
from 96 to 49. Furthermore, the proposed model achieves a score of 3.62 on the
newly introduced metric, surpassing the baseline score of 2.66.

Motivation: 第一人称视角视频中频繁剧烈的视角变化导致物体外观变化大、部分遮挡严重，现有方法难以实现精确定位，需要模拟人类认知过程的新方法来应对这些挑战。

Method: 提出HERO-VQL方法，包含：1) Top-down Attention Guidance(TAG)：利用类别token提供高层上下文，结合主成分得分图进行细粒度定位；2) EgoACT：通过替换查询对象和重排视频帧来增强查询多样性并模拟极端视角变化，使用一致性训练损失确保不同增强场景下的稳定定位。

Conclusion: HERO-VQL通过模拟人类认知过程的层次化方法，成功解决了第一人称视角视频中物体定位的难题，为这一具有挑战性的任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the egocentric visual query localization (VQL), where
a model should localize the query object in a long-form egocentric video.
Frequent and abrupt viewpoint changes in egocentric videos cause significant
object appearance variations and partial occlusions, making it difficult for
existing methods to achieve accurate localization. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce Hierarchical, Egocentric and RObust Visual Query Localization
(HERO-VQL), a novel method inspired by human cognitive process in object
recognition. We propose i) Top-down Attention Guidance (TAG) and ii) Egocentric
Augmentation based Consistency Training (EgoACT). Top-down Attention Guidance
refines the attention mechanism by leveraging the class token for high-level
context and principal component score maps for fine-grained localization. To
enhance learning in diverse and challenging matching scenarios, EgoAug enhances
query diversity by replacing the query with a randomly selected corresponding
object from groundtruth annotations and simulates extreme viewpoint changes by
reordering video frames. Additionally, CT loss enforces stable object
localization across different augmentation scenarios. Extensive experiments on
VQ2D dataset validate that HERO-VQL effectively handles egocentric challenges,
significantly outperforming baselines.

*Mengxiao Geng,Ran Hong,Bingxuan Li,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出双约束扩散模型(DCDM)用于超低剂量PET重建，通过冻结预训练扩散模型权重并注入可训练的双约束控制器，大幅减少可训练参数数量，能够适应不同剂量水平而无需重新训练所有参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超低剂量PET重建在减少患者辐射暴露和缩短检查时间方面具有重要潜力，但会导致噪声增加和成像细节减少，降低图像质量。需要一种能够灵活适应不同剂量水平的高质量重建方法。

Method: DCDM模型包含两个约束模块：核变换器约束(NTC)利用核范数作为矩阵秩最小化的近似，将低秩特性集成到Transformer架构中；编码连接约束(ENC)利用压缩特征表示来编码和控制预训练扩散模型。NTC从低剂量图像中提取信息并转换为潜在空间的压缩特征表示，ENC使用这些表示最终在像素空间获得重建PET图像。

Result: 在UDPET公共数据集和临床数据集上的实验表明，DCDM在已知剂量减少因子(DRF)方面优于最先进方法，并且在未知DRF场景下具有良好的泛化能力，即使在超低剂量水平(如全剂量的1%)下也证明有价值。

Conclusion: DCDM通过双约束控制器有效减少了可训练参数数量，能够灵活适应不同剂量水平而无需完全重新训练，在超低剂量PET重建中表现出优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Ultra-low-dose positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction holds
significant potential for reducing patient radiation exposure and shortening
examination times. However, it may also lead to increased noise and reduced
imaging detail, which could decrease the image quality. In this study, we
present a Double-Constraint Diffusion Model (DCDM), which freezes the weights
of a pre-trained diffusion model and injects a trainable double-constraint
controller into the encoding architecture, greatly reducing the number of
trainable parameters for ultra-low-dose PET reconstruction. Unlike full
fine-tuning models, DCDM can adapt to different dose levels without retraining
all model parameters, thereby improving reconstruction flexibility.
Specifically, the two constraint modules, named the Nuclear Transformer
Constraint (NTC) and the Encoding Nexus Constraint (ENC), serve to refine the
pre-trained diffusion model. The NTC leverages the nuclear norm as an
approximation for matrix rank minimization, integrates the low-rank property
into the Transformer architecture, and enables efficient information extraction
from low-dose images and conversion into compressed feature representations in
the latent space. Subsequently, the ENC utilizes these compressed feature
representations to encode and control the pre-trained diffusion model,
ultimately obtaining reconstructed PET images in the pixel space. In clinical
reconstruction, the compressed feature representations from NTC help select the
most suitable ENC for efficient unknown low-dose PET reconstruction.
Experiments conducted on the UDPET public dataset and the Clinical dataset
demonstrated that DCDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on known dose
reduction factors (DRF) and generalizes well to unknown DRF scenarios, proving
valuable even at ultra-low dose levels, such as 1% of the full dose.

Method: 提出DAOVI模型，包含基于测地距离评估时间运动信息的模块，以及专门处理几何畸变的深度感知特征传播模块。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在定量和定性评估上都优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DAOVI模型成功解决了全景视频修复中的几何畸变问题，为全景视频处理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos that capture the entire surroundings are employed in a
variety of fields such as VR applications and remote sensing. However, their
wide field of view often causes unwanted objects to appear in the videos. This
problem can be addressed by video inpainting, which enables the natural removal
of such objects while preserving both spatial and temporal consistency.
Nevertheless, most existing methods assume processing ordinary videos with a
narrow field of view and do not tackle the distortion in equirectangular
projection of omnidirectional videos. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a novel deep learning model for omnidirectional video inpainting,
called Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting (DAOVI). DAOVI
introduces a module that evaluates temporal motion information in the image
space considering geodesic distance, as well as a depth-aware feature
propagation module in the feature space that is designed to address the
geometric distortion inherent to omnidirectional videos. The experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively.

Abstract: We present a novel framework to reconstruct human avatars from monocular
videos. Recent approaches have struggled either to capture the fine-grained
dynamic details from the input or to generate plausible details at novel
viewpoints, which mainly stem from the limited representational capacity of the
avatar model and insufficient observational data. To overcome these challenges,
we propose to leverage the advanced video generative model, Human4DiT, to
generate the human motions from alternative perspective as an additional
supervision signal. This approach not only enriches the details in previously
unseen regions but also effectively regularizes the avatar representation to
mitigate artifacts. Furthermore, we introduce two complementary strategies to
enhance video generation: To ensure consistent reproduction of human motion, we
inject the physical identity into the model through video fine-tuning. For
higher-resolution outputs with finer details, a patch-based denoising algorithm
is employed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms

### [174] [LightVLM: Acceleraing Large Multimodal Models with Pyramid Token Merging and KV Cache Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00419)
*Lianyu Hu,Fanhua Shang,Wei Feng,Liang Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LightVLM是一种无需训练即可加速现有视觉语言模型推理的方法，通过编码阶段的金字塔令牌合并和解码阶段的KV缓存压缩，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在推理过程中存在效率低下的问题，特别是在处理长序列时延迟较高，需要一种无需重新训练就能加速推理的解决方案。

Method: 将VLM推理分为编码和解码两个阶段：编码阶段使用金字塔令牌合并技术分层减少令牌数量；解码阶段通过KV缓存压缩移除不必要的缓存来提升网络吞吐量。

Result: 实验结果显示，LightVLM在仅保留35%图像令牌时能保持100%性能，仅保留3%令牌时仍维持约98%性能。网络吞吐量提升2.02倍，预填充时间减少3.65倍，长序列生成时推理时间减少3.21倍。

Conclusion: LightVLM成功实现了在无需训练的情况下大幅加速VLM推理，使大型模型比小型模型推理更快，有望促进实际部署应用。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LightVLM, a simple but effective method that can
be seamlessly deployed upon existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to greatly
accelerate the inference process in a training-free manner. We divide the
inference procedure of VLMs into two stages, i.e., encoding and decoding, and
propose to simultaneously accelerate VLMs in both stages to largely improve
model efficiency. During encoding, we propose pyramid token merging to reduce
tokens of different LLM layers in a hierarchical manner by finally only keeping
a few dominant tokens to achieve high efficiency. During decoding, aimed at
reducing the high latency of outputting long sequences, we propose KV Cache
compression to remove unnecessary caches to increase the network throughput.
Experimental results show that LightVLM successfully retains 100% performance
when only preserving 35% image tokens, and maintains around 98% performance
when keeping only 3% image tokens. LightVLM could 2.02$\times$ the network
throughput and reduce the prefilling time by 3.65$\times$. LightVLM also makes
large VLMs faster again by enabling a heavy model (e.g., InternVL2.5 26B) to
infer faster than significantly smaller models (e.g., InternVL2.5 8B),
hopefully facilitating the real-world deployment. When generating long text
sequences (e.g., 4096 tokens), LightVLM could reduce the inference time by
3.21$\times$, largely outperforming existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在语义控制与生成质量之间存在平衡困难，需要更好的解耦控制和精细化生成能力。

Method: 采用掩码条件空间分解进行语义解耦潜在建模，结合全局和局部专家混合机制，以及动态门控网络实现时间依赖的空间控制。

Result: 在多模态和单模态人脸生成设置中表现出色，具有强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: Face-MoGLE为高质量可控人脸生成提供了强大灵活的解决方案，在生成建模和安全应用方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Controllable face generation poses critical challenges in generative modeling
due to the intricate balance required between semantic controllability and
photorealism. While existing approaches struggle with disentangling semantic
controls from generation pipelines, we revisit the architectural potential of
Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through the lens of expert specialization. This
paper introduces Face-MoGLE, a novel framework featuring: (1)
Semantic-decoupled latent modeling through mask-conditioned space
factorization, enabling precise attribute manipulation; (2) A mixture of global
and local experts that captures holistic structure and region-level semantics
for fine-grained controllability; (3) A dynamic gating network producing
time-dependent coefficients that evolve with diffusion steps and spatial
locations. Face-MoGLE provides a powerful and flexible solution for
high-quality, controllable face generation, with strong potential in generative
modeling and security applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate its
effectiveness in multimodal and monomodal face generation settings and its
robust zero-shot generalization capability. Project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SemaMIL是一个新的多实例学习框架，通过语义重排序和语义引导检索状态空间模块，在计算病理学中实现了最先进的准确率，同时降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的注意力机制MIL方法忽略了上下文关系，Transformer模型计算成本高且容易过拟合，状态空间模型虽然计算复杂度低但打乱补丁顺序会破坏组织学意义。

Method: 提出SemaMIL框架，包含语义重排序(SR)方法对语义相似的补丁进行聚类和排序，以及语义引导检索状态空间模块(SRSM)选择代表性查询子集来调整状态空间参数。

Result: 在四个WSI亚型数据集上的评估显示，SemaMIL相比强基线方法实现了最先进的准确率，同时使用了更少的FLOPs和参数。

Conclusion: SemaMIL成功解决了现有MIL方法的局限性，在保持组织学意义和可解释性的同时，实现了高效的全局建模和优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become the leading approach for
extracting discriminative features from whole slide images (WSIs) in
computational pathology. Attention-based MIL methods can identify key patches
but tend to overlook contextual relationships. Transformer models are able to
model interactions but require quadratic computational cost and are prone to
overfitting. State space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, yet shuffling
patch order disrupts histological meaning and reduces interpretability. In this
work, we introduce SemaMIL, which integrates Semantic Reordering (SR), an
adaptive method that clusters and arranges semantically similar patches in
sequence through a reversible permutation, with a Semantic-guided Retrieval
State Space Module (SRSM) that chooses a representative subset of queries to
adjust state space parameters for improved global modeling. Evaluation on four
WSI subtype datasets shows that, compared to strong baselines, SemaMIL achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer FLOPs and parameters.

TL;DR: 提出SA-LDL算法，通过阶段自适应方差建模和加权损失函数解决年龄估计中的标签模糊性问题，在MORPH-II和FG-NET数据集上分别达到1.74和2.15的MAE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过标签分布学习建模相邻年龄组的相关性，但忽略了不同年龄阶段存在不同程度的标签模糊性。通过分析锚点与所有其他年龄的嵌入相似性，发现标签模糊性呈现明显的阶段模式。

Method: 提出阶段自适应标签分布学习(SA-LDL)算法，联合使用阶段自适应方差建模和加权损失函数，有效捕捉标签模糊性的复杂结构化特征。

Result: 在MORPH-II数据集上MAE为1.74，在FG-NET数据集上MAE为2.15，表现出竞争性的性能。

Conclusion: SA-LDL能够更准确和鲁棒地进行年龄估计，通过阶段自适应方法有效解决了标签模糊性问题。

Abstract: Label ambiguity poses a significant challenge in age estimation tasks. Most
existing methods address this issue by modeling correlations between adjacent
age groups through label distribution learning. However, they often overlook
the varying degrees of ambiguity present across different age stages. In this
paper, we propose a Stage-wise Adaptive Label Distribution Learning (SA-LDL)
algorithm, which leverages the observation -- revealed through our analysis of
embedding similarities between an anchor and all other ages -- that label
ambiguity exhibits clear stage-wise patterns. By jointly employing stage-wise
adaptive variance modeling and weighted loss function, SA-LDL effectively
captures the complex and structured nature of label ambiguity, leading to more
accurate and robust age estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SA-LDL achieves competitive performance, with MAE of 1.74 and 2.15 on the
MORPH-II and FG-NET datasets.

TL;DR: 提出Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR)框架，通过分离特征学习和光流估计，使用3层ConvNet进行特征提取，在大变形模型下构建拉普拉斯特征金字塔，实现了更好的精度-效率和精度-平滑度权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于学习的可变形图像配准技术虽然提高了精度和速度，但仍面临计算复杂度高和处理大变形等挑战。研究发现ConvNet在配准中具有线性化局部强度和协调全局对比度变化两个关键作用。

Method: 提出EOIR框架，仅使用3层ConvNet进行特征提取，配合一组3层光流估计器构建拉普拉斯特征金字塔，在大变形模型下逐步组合微分同胚变形。

Result: 在五个不同模态和解剖区域的数据集上验证了EOIR的有效性，实现了优越的精度-效率和精度-平滑度权衡，在保持相当精度的同时提供更好的效率和平滑度。

Conclusion: EOIR框架通过分离特征学习和光流估计，实现了可变形图像配准中精度、效率和平滑度的更好平衡，为解决计算复杂度和处理大变形问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Learning-based techniques have significantly improved the accuracy and speed
of deformable image registration. However, challenges such as reducing
computational complexity and handling large deformations persist. To address
these challenges, we analyze how convolutional neural networks (ConvNets)
influence registration performance using the Horn-Schunck optical flow
equation. Supported by prior studies and our empirical experiments, we observe
that ConvNets play two key roles in registration: linearizing local intensities
and harmonizing global contrast variations. Based on these insights, we propose
the Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR) framework, designed to achieve a
better accuracy-efficiency trade-off. EOIR separates feature learning from flow
estimation, employing only a 3-layer ConvNet for feature extraction and a set
of 3-layer flow estimators to construct a Laplacian feature pyramid,
progressively composing diffeomorphic deformations under a large-deformation
model. Results on five datasets across different modalities and anatomical
regions demonstrate EOIR's effectiveness, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency and accuracy-smoothness trade-offs. With comparable
accuracy, EOIR provides better efficiency and smoothness, and vice versa. The
source code of EOIR will be publicly available on
https://github.com/XiangChen1994/EOIR.

TL;DR: VideoRewardBench是首个全面的视频多模态奖励模型评测基准，涵盖感知、知识、推理和安全四个维度，包含1,563个高质量标注样本，评测28个模型发现最佳模型准确率仅57.0%


<details>

Motivation: 现有视频多模态奖励模型评测基准存在样本数量少、多样性不足、评测维度不全面等问题，需要构建更全面的评测体系

Method: 通过AI辅助数据管道构建包含1,563个标注样本的高质量偏好数据集，每个样本包含视频-文本提示、优选响应和拒绝响应的三元组，覆盖四个核心视频理解维度

Result: 评测28个多模态奖励模型显示，最佳模型GPT-4o仅达到57.0%准确率，开源最佳模型Qwen2.5-VL-72B为53.3%，发现RL训练不一定带来更好的跨模态泛化能力

Conclusion: VideoRewardBench为视频领域多模态奖励模型的评估和发展提供了具有挑战性和价值的基准，揭示了当前模型的局限性

Abstract: Multimodal reward models (MRMs) play a crucial role in the training,
inference, and evaluation of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) by assessing
response quality. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating MRMs in the video
domain suffer from a limited number and diversity of questions, a lack of
comprehensive evaluation dimensions, and inadequate evaluation of diverse types
of MRMs. To address these gaps, we introduce VideoRewardBench, the first
comprehensive benchmark covering four core aspects of video understanding:
perception, knowledge, reasoning, and safety. Through our AI-assisted data
pipeline, we curate a high-quality preference dataset of 1,563 annotated
samples, including 1,482 unique videos and 1,559 distinct questions--15 times
the number found in the most question-rich prior benchmark. Each sample is a
triplet consisting of a video-text prompt, a chosen response, and a rejected
response. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 28 multimodal
reward models spanning three categories: generative, discriminative, and
semi-scalar. Results show that even the top-performing model GPT-4o achieves
only 57.0% overall accuracy, and the state-of-the-art open-source model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B reaches merely 53.3%. Our analysis further reveals three key
insights: (i) MRMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) do not necessarily
exhibit stronger cross-modal generalization than those trained without RL; (ii)
except for discriminative MRMs, other types of MRMs across varying model
capacities can benefit from inference-time scaling; and (iii) variations in
input video frame count have different effects on different types of MRMs. We
believe VideoRewardBench offers a challenging and valuable benchmark for
advancing the evaluation and development of MRMs in the video domain.

TL;DR: 本文提出STVH和M-STVH两种新的视频哈希操作技术，用于精确检索视频中的群体活动，而不仅仅是整个视频。M-STVH作为增强版本，能同时关注活动语义特征和对象视觉特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着各种复杂场景中视频数据的爆发式增长，快速检索群体活动成为紧迫需求。现有方法大多只能检索整个视频，而不能做到活动级别的精确检索。

Method: STVH通过统一框架同时建模个体对象动态和群体交互，捕捉空间时间演化。M-STVH作为增强版本，采用多重关注表征学习进行层次特征集成，能同时关注活动语义特征和对象视觉特征。

Result: 在公开数据集上进行的对比实验表明，STVH和M-STVH都能获得优秀的结果。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了能够在活动级别精确检索视频的新型哈希操作技术，M-STVH的多重关注特性更是能够满足实际检索中对不同特征需求的灵活性。

Abstract: With the explosive growth of video data in various complex scenarios, quickly
retrieving group activities has become an urgent problem. However, many tasks
can only retrieve videos focusing on an entire video, not the activity
granularity. To solve this problem, we propose a new STVH (spatiotemporal
interleaved video hashing) technique for the first time. Through a unified
framework, the STVH simultaneously models individual object dynamics and group
interactions, capturing the spatiotemporal evolution on both group visual
features and positional features. Moreover, in real-life video retrieval
scenarios, it may sometimes require activity features, while at other times, it
may require visual features of objects. We then further propose a novel M-STVH
(multi-focused spatiotemporal video hashing) as an enhanced version to handle
this difficult task. The advanced method incorporates hierarchical feature
integration through multi-focused representation learning, allowing the model
to jointly focus on activity semantics features and object visual features. We
conducted comparative experiments on publicly available datasets, and both STVH
and M-STVH can achieve excellent results.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同设备采集的超声图像存在风格差异，导致下游任务性能下降。现有无配对图像转换方法未能有效筛选与下游任务最相关的风格特征

Method: 提出token驱动的双流框架，从数据视角选择合适的目标token，从模型视角识别最优目标token，并使用行为镜像损失和辅助提示来匹配内容表示

Result: 在超声数据集上的实验表明，TRUST在视觉质量和下游任务性能方面均优于现有无配对图像转换方法

Conclusion: TRUST框架能有效解决超声图像风格差异问题，通过精确的风格特征选择提升下游任务性能

Abstract: Ultrasound images acquired from different devices exhibit diverse styles,
resulting in decreased performance of downstream tasks. To mitigate the style
gap, unpaired image-to-image (UI2I) translation methods aim to transfer images
from a source domain, corresponding to new device acquisitions, to a target
domain where a frozen task model has been trained for downstream applications.
However, existing UI2I methods have not explicitly considered filtering the
most relevant style features, which may result in translated images misaligned
with the needs of downstream tasks. In this work, we propose TRUST, a
token-driven dual-stream framework that preserves source content while
transferring the common style of the target domain, ensuring that content and
style remain unblended. Given multiple styles in the target domain, we
introduce a Token-dRiven (TR) module that operates from two perspectives: (1) a
data view--selecting "suitable" target tokens corresponding to each source
token, and (2) a model view--identifying ``optimal" target tokens for the
downstream model, guided by a behavior mirror loss. Additionally, we inject
auxiliary prompts into the source encoder to match content representation with
downstream behavior. Experimental results on ultrasound datasets demonstrate
that TRUST outperforms existing UI2I methods in both visual quality and
downstream task performance.

Motivation: AI即服务的普及使得预训练模型可通过API访问，但黑盒模型不暴露权重、训练数据或logits，现有域适应方法无法适用，需要新的蒸馏方法

Method: 提出ATGC方法，利用DINOv2注意力图通过熵评分动态选择最优推理尺度，识别信息丰富的尺度进行伪标签生成，实现黑盒监督下的有效蒸馏

Result: 实验表明在多个数据集上，仅使用one-hot API预测就能在黑盒监督下取得显著改进

Conclusion: ATGC方法成功解决了黑盒蒸馏中的分辨率敏感性问题，为仅使用one-hot预测的本地模型训练提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) democratizes access
to pre-trained models via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), but also
raises a fundamental question: how can local models be effectively trained
using black-box models that do not expose their weights, training data, or
logits, a constraint in which current domain adaptation paradigms are
impractical ? To address this challenge, we introduce the Black-Box
Distillation (B2D) setting, which enables local model adaptation under
realistic constraints: (1) the API model is open-vocabulary and trained on
large-scale general-purpose data, and (2) access is limited to one-hot
predictions only. We identify that open-vocabulary models exhibit significant
sensitivity to input resolution, with different object classes being segmented
optimally at different scales, a limitation termed the "curse of resolution".
Our method, ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC), addresses this challenge by
leveraging DINOv2 attention maps to dynamically select optimal scales for
black-box model inference. ATGC scores the attention maps with entropy to
identify informative scales for pseudo-labelling, enabling effective
distillation. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements under black-box
supervision across multiple datasets while requiring only one-hot API
predictions. Our code is available at https://github.com/yasserben/ATGC.

Motivation: 现有CISS方法存在灾难性语义纠缠问题，包括原型-特征纠缠和背景-增量纠缠，导致显著噪声和错误

Method: 语言引导的Bootstrapped解耦框架(LBD)，包含语言引导原型解耦和流形互斥背景解耦，结合软提示调优和编码器适配

Result: 在Pascal VOC和ADE20k数据集上实现最先进性能，特别是在多步增量场景中表现优异

Conclusion: LBD框架有效解决了CISS中的语义纠缠问题，通过语言先验引导实现了更好的特征解耦和知识保持

Abstract: Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) requires continuous learning
of newly introduced classes while retaining knowledge of past classes. By
abstracting mainstream methods into two stages (visual feature extraction and
prototype-feature matching), we identify a more fundamental challenge termed
catastrophic semantic entanglement. This phenomenon involves Prototype-Feature
Entanglement caused by semantic misalignment during the incremental process,
and Background-Increment Entanglement due to dynamic data evolution. Existing
techniques, which rely on visual feature learning without sufficient cues to
distinguish targets, introduce significant noise and errors. To address these
issues, we introduce a Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement framework
(LBD). We leverage the prior class semantics of pre-trained visual-language
models (e.g., CLIP) to guide the model in autonomously disentangling features
through Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement and Manifold Mutual
Background Disentanglement. The former guides the disentangling of new
prototypes by treating hand-crafted text features as topological templates,
while the latter employs multiple learnable prototypes and mask-pooling-based
supervision for background-incremental class disentanglement. By incorporating
soft prompt tuning and encoder adaptation modifications, we further bridge the
capability gap of CLIP between dense and sparse tasks, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on both Pascal VOC and ADE20k, particularly in
multi-step scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法在校准医学成像（如CT）中表现优异，但在未校准模态（特别是MRI）中泛化能力差，对MR对比度、分辨率和方向的差异敏感，限制了在多样化临床协议中的广泛应用。

Method: 提出"轻度到重度"主体内生成和"真实-合成"混合训练策略，使模型对获取图像的外观（如模态、对比度、变形、分辨率、伪影）具有弹性。

Result: 在11个公共数据集上评估，证明BrainFM在所有任务和输入模态中都具有鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: BrainFM作为一个模态无关的基础模型，能够直接应用于多种脑成像基础任务，为解决医学成像中的模态差异问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent learning-based approaches have made astonishing advances in calibrated
medical imaging like computerized tomography (CT), yet they struggle to
generalize in uncalibrated modalities -- notably magnetic resonance (MR)
imaging, where performance is highly sensitive to the differences in MR
contrast, resolution, and orientation. This prevents broad applicability to
diverse real-world clinical protocols. Here we introduce BrainFM, a
modality-agnostic, multi-task vision foundation model for human brain imaging.
With the proposed "mild-to-severe" intra-subject generation and "real-synth"
mix-up training strategy, BrainFM is resilient to the appearance of acquired
images (e.g., modality, contrast, deformation, resolution, artifacts), and can
be directly applied to five fundamental brain imaging tasks, including image
synthesis for CT and T1w/T2w/FLAIR MRI, anatomy segmentation, scalp-to-cortical
distance, bias field estimation, and registration. We evaluate the efficacy of
BrainFM on eleven public datasets, and demonstrate its robustness and
effectiveness across all tasks and input modalities. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出Context-Aware Fusion (CAF)方法，通过交叉注意力机制整合全局场景上下文和局部提案特征，在细粒度车辆损伤检测任务中超越现有最佳模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细粒度目标检测在视觉挑战性领域（如车辆损伤评估）中极具挑战性。DiffusionDet虽然通过条件去噪扩散推进了技术发展，但在上下文相关场景中受限于局部特征条件化

Method: 引入Context-Aware Fusion (CAF)，利用交叉注意力机制将全局场景上下文与局部提案特征直接整合。使用独立的专用编码器生成全局上下文，捕获全面的环境信息，使每个目标提案都能关注场景级理解

Result: 在CarDD基准测试中相比最先进模型有显著提升，为细粒度领域的上下文感知目标检测建立了新的性能基准

Conclusion: 该框架通过使每个目标提案能够关注全面的环境信息，显著增强了生成式检测范式的性能，在细粒度目标检测任务中取得了突破性进展

Abstract: Fine-grained object detection in challenging visual domains, such as vehicle
damage assessment, presents a formidable challenge even for human experts to
resolve reliably. While DiffusionDet has advanced the state-of-the-art through
conditional denoising diffusion, its performance remains limited by local
feature conditioning in context-dependent scenarios. We address this
fundamental limitation by introducing Context-Aware Fusion (CAF), which
leverages cross-attention mechanisms to integrate global scene context with
local proposal features directly. The global context is generated using a
separate dedicated encoder that captures comprehensive environmental
information, enabling each object proposal to attend to scene-level
understanding. Our framework significantly enhances the generative detection
paradigm by enabling each object proposal to attend to comprehensive
environmental information. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement over
state-of-the-art models on the CarDD benchmark, establishing new performance
benchmarks for context-aware object detection in fine-grained domains

Result: 该方法实现了遥感图像的开集语义分割和参考表达分割，通过多尺度对齐提高了分割精度和可解释性。

Conclusion: DGL-RSIS框架成功解决了视觉语言模型在遥感图像分割中的领域适应问题，无需额外训练即可实现准确的多模态理解，为遥感图像分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of vision language models (VLMs) has bridged vision and
language, enabling joint multimodal understanding beyond traditional
visual-only deep learning models. However, transferring VLMs from the natural
image domain to remote sensing (RS) segmentation remains challenging due to the
limited category diversity in RS datasets and the domain gap between natural
and RS imagery. Here, we propose a training-free framework, DGL-RSIS, that
decouples visual and textual inputs, performing visual-language alignment at
both the local semantic and global contextual levels through tailored
strategies. Specifically, we first introduce a global-local decoupling (GLD)
module, where text inputs are divided into local class nouns and global
modifiers using natural language processing (NLP) techniques; image inputs are
partitioned into a set of class-agnostic mask proposals via unsupervised mask
proposal networks. Second, visual and textual features are aligned at local
scale, through a novel context-aware cropping strategy for extracting image
patches with proper boundaries and introducing RS-specific knowledge to enrich
the text inputs. By matching the enhanced text features with mask-guided visual
features, we enable the mask classification, supporting open-vocabulary
semantic segmentation (OVSS). Third, at the global scale, we propose a
Cross-Scale Grad-CAM module to refine Grad-CAM maps using contextual
information from global modifiers. A subsequent mask selection module
integrates pixel-level Grad-CAM activations into the mask-level segmentation
output, such that accurate and interpretable alignment can be realized across
global and local dimensions for referring expression segmentation (RES).

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a major driver of climate change,
making its timely detection critical for effective mitigation. Machine learning
(ML) deployed onboard satellites can enable rapid detection while reducing
downlink costs, supporting faster response systems. Conventional methane
detection methods often rely on image processing techniques, such as
orthorectification to correct geometric distortions and matched filters to
enhance plume signals. We introduce a novel approach that bypasses these
preprocessing steps by using \textit{unorthorectified} data (UnorthoDOS). We
find that ML models trained on this dataset achieve performance comparable to
those trained on orthorectified data. Moreover, we also train models on an
orthorectified dataset, showing that they can outperform the matched filter
baseline (mag1c). We release model checkpoints and two ML-ready datasets
comprising orthorectified and unorthorectified hyperspectral images from the
Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) sensor at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/SpaceML/UnorthoDOS , along with code at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MV-SSM是一个新颖的多视角状态空间建模框架，通过投影状态空间块和网格令牌引导的双向扫描技术，显著提升了多视角3D人体姿态估计的泛化能力，在多个基准测试中大幅超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于注意力机制的变换器在多视角3D人体姿态估计中存在两个主要问题：难以准确建模关键点的空间排列（特别是在遮挡场景中），以及容易过拟合训练数据中的特定相机配置和视觉场景，导致在新设置中性能大幅下降。

Method: 提出了MV-SSM框架，在两个不同层次上显式建模关节空间序列：多视角图像的特征层次和人体关键点层次。使用投影状态空间块（PSS）通过状态空间建模学习关节空间排列的泛化表示，并改进Mamba的传统扫描为网格令牌引导的双向扫描（GTBS）。

Result: 在多个实验中表现出强大的泛化能力：在CMU Panoptic的三相机设置上AP25提升10.8（+24%），在变化相机配置上AP25提升7.0（+13%），在跨数据集评估的Campus A1上PCP提升15.3（+38%），均显著超越最先进方法。

Conclusion: MV-SSM框架通过创新的状态空间建模和扫描机制，有效解决了多视角3D人体姿态估计中的泛化问题，为处理新相机配置和遮挡场景提供了强有力的解决方案。

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in single-view 3D human pose
estimation, multi-view 3D human pose estimation remains challenging,
particularly in terms of generalizing to new camera configurations. Existing
attention-based transformers often struggle to accurately model the spatial
arrangement of keypoints, especially in occluded scenarios. Additionally, they
tend to overfit specific camera arrangements and visual scenes from training
data, resulting in substantial performance drops in new settings. In this
study, we introduce a novel Multi-View State Space Modeling framework, named
MV-SSM, for robustly estimating 3D human keypoints. We explicitly model the
joint spatial sequence at two distinct levels: the feature level from
multi-view images and the person keypoint level. We propose a Projective State
Space (PSS) block to learn a generalized representation of joint spatial
arrangements using state space modeling. Moreover, we modify Mamba's
traditional scanning into an effective Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning
(GTBS), which is integral to the PSS block. Multiple experiments demonstrate
that MV-SSM achieves strong generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods: +10.8 on AP25 (+24%) on the challenging three-camera setting in CMU
Panoptic, +7.0 on AP25 (+13%) on varying camera arrangements, and +15.3 PCP
(+38%) on Campus A1 in cross-dataset evaluations. Project Website:

Abstract: Identifying jewelry pieces presents a significant challenge due to the wide
range of styles and designs. Currently, precise descriptions are typically
limited to industry experts. However, translators and interpreters often
require a comprehensive understanding of these items. In this study, we
introduce an innovative approach to automatically identify and describe jewelry
using neural networks. This method enables translators and interpreters to
quickly access accurate information, aiding in resolving queries and gaining
essential knowledge about jewelry. Our model operates at three distinct levels
of description, employing computer vision techniques and image captioning to
emulate expert analysis of accessories. The key innovation involves generating
natural language descriptions of jewelry across three hierarchical levels,
capturing nuanced details of each piece. Different image captioning
architectures are utilized to detect jewels in images and generate descriptions
with varying levels of detail. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
in recognizing diverse types of jewelry, we assembled a comprehensive database
of accessory images. The evaluation process involved comparing various image
captioning architectures, focusing particularly on the encoder decoder model,
crucial for generating descriptive captions. After thorough evaluation, our
final model achieved a captioning accuracy exceeding 90 per cent.

TL;DR: FtZ框架通过组合语义强大的锚定编码器和感知丰富的增强编码器，解决了MLLMs在细粒度视觉任务上的性能瓶颈，显著提升了多个基准测试的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在复杂语义理解方面表现出色，但在需要精确细节感知的基础视觉任务上存在缺陷，主要原因是单一视觉编码器架构牺牲了细粒度视觉信息捕捉能力。

Method: 提出FtZ视觉塔框架，创新性地通过轻量级多头交叉注意力机制，将语义强大的锚定编码器与感知丰富的增强编码器组合使用，超越单一编码器设计。

Result: 在TextVQA、POPE、MMMU、MME和MM-Vet等需要细粒度视觉理解的挑战性基准测试中，FtZ模型显著优于仅使用单一编码器或现有特征融合方法的基线模型。

Conclusion: 组合异构专家编码器是克服当前MLLMs视觉感知瓶颈的高效有效途径，为构建具有更强感知能力的下一代AI系统提供了新的设计范式。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
bridging visual perception with high-level textual reasoning. However, they
face a fundamental contradiction: while excelling at complex semantic
understanding, these models often fail at basic visual tasks that require
precise detail perception. This deficiency primarily stems from the prevalent
architectural reliance on a single vision encoder optimized for high-level
semantic alignment, which inherently sacrifices the ability to capture
fine-grained visual information. To address this issue, we introduce Fusion to
Enhance (FtZ), a novel vision tower framework. FtZ moves beyond the
single-encoder design by innovatively composing a semantically powerful anchor
encoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder via a lightweight Multi-Head
Cross-Attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that on several
challenging benchmarks demanding fine-grained visual understanding, such as
TextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME and MM-Vet, our FtZ model significantly outperforms
baselines that use only a single encoder or existing feature fusion methods.
This work proves that composing heterogeneous expert encoders is an efficient
and effective path to overcoming the visual perception bottleneck in current
MLLMs, offering a new design paradigm for building next-generation AI systems
with stronger perceptual capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出STM策略，通过参数高效微调视觉基础模型，仅使用少量正常天气数据实现恶劣天气下的单目深度估计，在多个真实基准测试中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣天气条件下的单目深度估计面临缺乏可靠真值和难以从未标注真实数据学习的挑战，现有方法存在域差距或违反光度假设的问题

Method: 提出Selecting-Tuning-Maintaining (STM)策略，基于熵秩和稳定秩结构分解预训练权重，自适应选择秩数和任务感知奇异方向，并施加主方向正则化

Result: 在四个真实世界基准测试中，STM不仅优于现有PEFT方法和全微调，还超越了使用恶劣合成数据训练的方法，甚至超越了深度基础模型

Conclusion: STM策略能够灵活适应任务同时保持预训练模型的强泛化能力，为恶劣天气下的深度估计提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation under adverse weather conditions (e.g.\ rain, fog,
snow, and nighttime) remains highly challenging due to the lack of reliable
ground truth and the difficulty of learning from unlabeled real-world data.
Existing methods often rely on synthetic adverse data with pseudo-labels, which
suffer from domain gaps, or employ self-supervised learning, which violates
photometric assumptions in adverse scenarios. In this work, we propose to
achieve weather--generalized depth estimation by Parameter--Efficient
Fine--Tuning (PEFT) of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), using only a small
amount of high--visibility (normal) data. While PEFT has shown strong
performance in semantic tasks such as segmentation, it remains underexplored
for geometry--centric tasks like depth estimation -- especially in terms of
balancing effective adaptation with the preservation of pretrained knowledge.
To this end, we introduce the Selecting--Tuning--Maintaining (STM) strategy,
which structurally decomposes the pretrained weights of VFMs based on two kinds
of effective ranks (entropy--rank and stable--rank). In the tuning phase, we
adaptively select the proper rank number as well as the task--aware singular
directions for initialization, based on the entropy--rank and full--tuned
weight; while in the maintaining stage, we enforce a principal direction
regularization based on the stable--rank. This design guarantees flexible task
adaptation while preserving the strong generalization capability of the
pretrained VFM. Extensive experiments on four real--world benchmarks across
diverse weather conditions demonstrate that STM not only outperforms existing
PEFT methods and full fine--tuning but also surpasses methods trained with
adverse synthetic data, and even the depth foundation model

*Xiyao Wang,Chunyuan Li,Jianwei Yang,Kai Zhang,Bo Liu,Tianyi Xiong,Furong Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文挑战了视觉语言模型中批评模型只用于评估而不用于生成的惯例，提出通过重组偏好标签数据集进行强化学习，训练出既能评估又能生成的统一模型LLaVA-Critic-R1，在26个视觉推理基准上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉语言建模中，批评模型仅用于评估输出（打分或偏好排序），而策略模型负责生成响应，这种分离导致批评模型很少被考虑直接用于策略生成。本文旨在打破这一惯例。

Method: 将偏好标签的批评数据集重组为可验证的训练信号，在基础生成模型上直接进行强化学习，训练出多模态批评模型LLaVA-Critic-R1，同时保持完整的生成能力。

Result: LLaVA-Critic-R1不仅成为顶级批评模型，还是具有竞争力的策略模型——在26个视觉推理和理解基准上匹配或超越专门训练的推理VLM，平均比基础模型(Qwen-2.5-VL-7B)提升5.7%。扩展该方法得到的LLaVA-Critic-R1+在7B规模上达到MMMU基准71.9的SOTA性能。测试时自批评推理在五个代表性推理任务上平均提升13.8%。

Conclusion: 在批评数据上进行RL训练可以产生一个在评估和生成方面都表现出色的统一模型，为可扩展的自改进多模态系统提供了一条简单路径。

Abstract: In vision-language modeling, critic models are typically trained to evaluate
outputs -- assigning scalar scores or pairwise preferences -- rather than to
generate responses. This separation from policy models, which produce the
responses, is so entrenched that critics are rarely considered for direct
policy use. In this work, we challenge this convention. We propose to
reorganize preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals
and perform reinforcement learning directly on a base generative model,
producing LLaVA-Critic-R1, a multimodal critic trained to optimize preference
judgments while retaining full generation ability. Surprisingly,
LLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges not only as a top-performing critic but also as a
competitive policy model -- matching or surpassing specialized reasoning VLMs
trained with in-domain data across 26 visual reasoning and understanding
benchmarks, with an average gain of +5.7% over its base model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B).
Extending this approach to existing strong reasoning VLMs yields
LLaVA-Critic-R1+, which further advances policy performance without sacrificing
critic quality, achieving a SoTA performance of 71.9 on MMMU at the 7B scale.
Finally, we show that the enhanced critic ability benefits inference: applying
self-critique at test time yields an average +13.8% improvement on five
representative reasoning tasks without additional training. Our results reveal
that RL training on critic data can produce a unified model excelling at both
evaluation and generation, offering a simple path toward scalable,
self-improving multimodal systems.

Motivation: 现有多模态融合方法存在二次计算复杂度问题，难以建模长距离空间-光谱特征依赖关系。Mamba虽然解决了计算复杂度问题，但不能直接进行特征融合。

Method: 设计预处理模块适配Mamba结构，结合CNN提取多层特征；创新设计基于Mamba算子的跨状态模块进行双模态特征融合；构建结合Mamba和CNN优势的更强主干网络。

Result: 在MUUFL和Houston2018两个数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在降低网络训练负担的前提下，超越了Transformer的实验结果。

Conclusion: CSFMamba网络成功利用了Mamba的低计算负担优势，探索了多模态特征融合的内部结构潜力，实现了更强的全图像理解能力。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion has made great progress in the field of remote sensing
image classification due to its ability to exploit the complementary
spatial-spectral information. Deep learning methods such as CNN and Transformer
have been widely used in these domains. State Space Models recently highlighted
that prior methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity. As a result,
modeling longer-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features imposes an
overwhelming burden on the network. Mamba solves this problem by incorporating
time-varying parameters into ordinary SSM and performing hardware optimization,
but it cannot perform feature fusion directly. In order to make full use of
Mamba's low computational burden and explore the potential of internal
structure in multimodal feature fusion, we propose Cross State Fusion Mamba
(CSFMamba) Network. Specifically, we first design the preprocessing module of
remote sensing image information for the needs of Mamba structure, and combine
it with CNN to extract multi-layer features. Secondly, a cross-state module
based on Mamba operator is creatively designed to fully fuse the feature of the
two modalities. The advantages of Mamba and CNN are combined by designing a
more powerful backbone. We capture the fusion relationship between HSI and
LiDAR modalities with stronger full-image understanding. The experimental
results on two datasets of MUUFL and Houston2018 show that the proposed method
outperforms the experimental results of Transformer under the premise of
reducing the network training burden.

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition leverages sequences of human joint
coordinates to identify actions performed in videos. Owing to the intrinsic
spatiotemporal structure of skeleton data, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
have been the dominant architecture in this field. However, recent advances in
transformer models and masked pretraining frameworks open new avenues for
representation learning. In this work, we propose CascadeFormer, a family of
two-stage cascading transformers for skeleton-based human action recognition.
Our framework consists of a masked pretraining stage to learn generalizable
skeleton representations, followed by a cascading fine-tuning stage tailored
for discriminative action classification. We evaluate CascadeFormer across
three benchmark datasets (Penn Action N-UCLA, and NTU RGB+D 60), achieving
competitive performance on all tasks. To promote reproducibility, we release
our code and model checkpoints.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine a vision encoder and a large language
model (LLM) through alignment training, showing strong performance on
multimodal tasks. A central component in this architecture is the projection
layer, which maps visual features into the LLM's embedding space. Despite its
importance, its ability to generalize to unseen visual concepts has not been
systematically evaluated. To address this, we propose a benchmark for
evaluating projection-layer generalization. We adapt object detection datasets
(rich in fine-grained annotations) into a prompting format and design
train/test splits with disjoint label sets, enabling precise control over seen
and unseen concept separation. Experimental results show that the projection
layer retains about 79 to 88 percent of the performance on unseen classes
compared to seen ones across various settings, suggesting a non-trivial level
of generalization even without explicit alignment supervision on those
concepts. We further analyze this behavior through a mechanistic
interpretability lens. Our findings indicate that the feed-forward network in
the projection layer functions like a key-value memory, processing seen and
unseen tokens in similar ways. This study introduces a new evaluation framework
for alignment generalization and highlights the potential for efficient VLM
training with limited aligned data.

Conclusion: 提出的公平性算法为皮肤病变分类提供了一种实用的解决方案，能够在保持公平性的同时降低计算需求，更适合实际应用

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy of
skin lesion classification models, supporting medical diagnoses and promoting
equitable healthcare. However, concerns remain about potential biases related
to skin color, which can impact diagnostic outcomes. Ensuring fairness is
challenging due to difficulties in classifying skin tones, high computational
demands, and the complexity of objectively verifying fairness. To address these
challenges, we propose a fairness algorithm for skin lesion classification that
overcomes the challenges associated with achieving diagnostic fairness across
varying skin tones. By calculating the skewness of the feature map in the
convolution layer of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) network and the patches
and the heads of the Vision Transformer, our method reduces unnecessary
channels related to skin tone, focusing instead on the lesion area. This
approach lowers computational costs and mitigates bias without relying on
conventional statistical methods. It potentially reduces model size while
maintaining fairness, making it more practical for real-world applications.

*Sangyu Han,Yearim Kim,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaFE方法通过有效感受野和输入归因技术，揭示视觉SAE特征的真实因果驱动因素，而非仅依赖激活位置，避免了传统激活图可能导致的误解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过检查特征激活最高的图像块来理解稀疏自编码器特征，但由于自注意力机制在整个图像中混合信息，激活的块往往只是与特征激活共现而非真正原因，这可能导致对特征含义的错误解读。

Method: 提出因果特征解释(CaFE)方法，利用有效感受野(ERF)和输入归因技术，将每个SAE特征激活视为目标，识别真正因果驱动该激活的图像块。

Result: 在CLIP-ViT特征上的实验显示，ERF图与朴素激活图经常存在差异，揭示了隐藏的上下文依赖关系。补丁插入测试证实CaFE比基于激活排序的补丁更有效地恢复或抑制特征激活。

Conclusion: CaFE提供了更忠实和语义精确的视觉SAE特征解释，强调了仅依赖激活位置进行解释的风险，为理解视觉Transformer中的特征表示提供了更可靠的因果分析方法。

Abstract: Understanding what sparse auto-encoder (SAE) features in vision transformers
truly represent is usually done by inspecting the patches where a feature's
activation is highest. However, self-attention mixes information across the
entire image, so an activated patch often co-occurs with-but does not cause-the
feature's firing. We propose Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE), which leverages
Effective Receptive Field (ERF). We consider each activation of an SAE feature
to be a target and apply input-attribution methods to identify the image
patches that causally drive that activation. Across CLIP-ViT features, ERF maps
frequently diverge from naive activation maps, revealing hidden context
dependencies (e.g., a "roaring face" feature that requires the co-occurrence of
eyes and nose, rather than merely an open mouth). Patch insertion tests confirm
that CaFE more effectively recovers or suppresses feature activations than
activation-ranked patches. Our results show that CaFE yields more faithful and
semantically precise explanations of vision-SAE features, highlighting the risk
of misinterpretation when relying solely on activation location.

Conclusion: 结合基于语言的推理和多模态检索的方法对于复杂真实世界图像理解是有效的

Abstract: Event-based image retrieval from free-form captions presents a significant
challenge: models must understand not only visual features but also latent
event semantics, context, and real-world knowledge. Conventional
vision-language retrieval approaches often fall short when captions describe
abstract events, implicit causality, temporal context, or contain long, complex
narratives. To tackle these issues, we introduce a multi-stage retrieval
framework combining dense article retrieval, event-aware language model
reranking, and efficient image collection, followed by caption-guided semantic
matching and rank-aware selection. We leverage Qwen3 for article search,
Qwen3-Reranker for contextual alignment, and Qwen2-VL for precise image
scoring. To further enhance performance and robustness, we fuse outputs from
multiple configurations using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Our system achieves
the top-1 score on the private test set of Track 2 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand
Challenge, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining language-based
reasoning and multimodal retrieval for complex, real-world image understanding.

TL;DR: 提出一个统一的视觉-语言框架，专门用于耳鼻喉内窥镜图像分析，同时处理图像分类、图像检索和文本检索三个临床相关任务，在ACM MM'25挑战赛中取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN方法难以捕捉跨模态语义，医疗数据有限且需要更好的多模态理解能力，特别是在低资源临床环境中。

Method: 基于CLIP ViT-B/16骨干网络，采用低秩适应、多级CLS令牌聚合和球面特征插值技术，结合类别特定的自然语言提示和联合训练目标（监督分类+对比学习）。

Result: 在ACM MM'25挑战赛中达到95%的分类准确率和F1分数，图像检索Recall@1为0.93，文本检索Recall@1为0.92，MRR分数分别为0.97和0.96。

Conclusion: 消融研究验证了各架构组件的增量效益，证明该设计在低资源临床环境中能够实现稳健的多模态医疗理解。

Abstract: We present a unified vision-language framework tailored for ENT endoscopy
image analysis that simultaneously tackles three clinically-relevant tasks:
image classification, image-to-image retrieval, and text-to-image retrieval.
Unlike conventional CNN-based pipelines that struggle to capture cross-modal
semantics, our approach leverages the CLIP ViT-B/16 backbone and enhances it
through Low-Rank Adaptation, multi-level CLS token aggregation, and spherical
feature interpolation. These components collectively enable efficient
fine-tuning on limited medical data while improving representation diversity
and semantic alignment across modalities. To bridge the gap between visual
inputs and textual diagnostic context, we introduce class-specific natural
language prompts that guide the image encoder through a joint training
objective combining supervised classification with contrastive learning. We
validated our framework through participation in the ACM MM'25 ENTRep Grand
Challenge, achieving 95% accuracy and F1-score in classification, Recall@1 of
0.93 and 0.92 for image-to-image and text-to-image retrieval respectively, and
MRR scores of 0.97 and 0.96. Ablation studies demonstrated the incremental
benefits of each architectural component, validating the effectiveness of our
design for robust multimodal medical understanding in low-resource clinical
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射技术日益流行，需要有效的版权保护方法。现有水印方法需要为每个预定义消息进行计算昂贵的微调过程。

Method: 提出GaussianBridge将非结构化3D高斯转换为Splatter Image格式，支持任意消息嵌入；设计高斯不确定性感知热图预测策略保证视觉质量；开发基于密集分割的提取机制确保鲁棒性。

Abstract: The growing popularity of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has intensified the
need for effective copyright protection. Current 3DGS watermarking methods rely
on computationally expensive fine-tuning procedures for each predefined
message. We propose the first generalizable watermarking framework that enables
efficient protection of Splatter Image-based 3DGS models through a single
forward pass. We introduce GaussianBridge that transforms unstructured 3D
Gaussians into Splatter Image format, enabling direct neural processing for
arbitrary message embedding. To ensure imperceptibility, we design a
Gaussian-Uncertainty-Perceptual heatmap prediction strategy for preserving
visual quality. For robust message recovery, we develop a dense
segmentation-based extraction mechanism that maintains reliable extraction even
when watermarked objects occupy minimal regions in rendered views. Project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文发现并解决了检测变换器在人类-物体交互检测中的'Toxic Siblings'偏差问题，提出了两种新的去偏学习目标，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测变换器在人类-物体交互检测中取得了显著进展，但存在'Toxic Siblings'偏差问题，即大量相似但不同的HOI三元组在交互解码器的输入和输出端相互干扰和竞争，导致学习困难。

Method: 提出了两种去偏学习目标：1）'contrastive-then-calibration' - 从输入角度采样类似但不正确的HOI三元组，通过强位置先验重构为正确三元组；2）'merge-then-split' - 从输出角度先学习兄弟类别的共享特征以区分其他组，然后显式细化组内差异以保持独特性。

Result: 在HICO-Det数据集上显著超越基线方法（+9.18% mAP）和最先进方法（+3.59% mAP），在各种设置下都表现出优异性能。

Conclusion: 提出的两种去偏学习目标有效解决了'Toxic Siblings'偏差问题，显著提升了人类-物体交互检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Detection transformers have been applied to human-object interaction (HOI)
detection, enhancing the localization and recognition of human-action-object
triplets in images. Despite remarkable progress, this study identifies a
critical issue-"Toxic Siblings" bias-which hinders the interaction decoder's
learning, as numerous similar yet distinct HOI triplets interfere with and even
compete against each other both input side and output side to the interaction
decoder. This bias arises from high confusion among sibling
triplets/categories, where increased similarity paradoxically reduces
precision, as one's gain comes at the expense of its toxic sibling's decline.
To address this, we propose two novel debiasing learning
objectives-"contrastive-then-calibration" and "merge-then-split"-targeting the
input and output perspectives, respectively. The former samples sibling-like
incorrect HOI triplets and reconstructs them into correct ones, guided by
strong positional priors. The latter first learns shared features among sibling
categories to distinguish them from other groups, then explicitly refines
intra-group differentiation to preserve uniqueness. Experiments show that we
significantly outperform both the baseline (+9.18% mAP on HICO-Det) and the
state-of-the-art (+3.59% mAP) across various settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动生成方法主要针对孤立人物在空场景中的动画，缺乏大规模的人-物交互数据集，限制了复杂3D场景中真实人-物交互的合成能力。

Method: 开发了自动运动提取流水线，从45.8K个人-物交互视频中自动收集交互丰富的3D人体运动数据和对应的文本描述。

Result: 实验表明InterPose显著提升了最先进的人体运动生成方法性能，并基于此开发了支持零样本人-物交互动画的LLM智能体。

Conclusion: InterPose数据集解决了人-物交互数据稀缺问题，为复杂场景中高质量人-物交互动画生成提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Human motion generation has shown great advances thanks to the recent
diffusion models trained on large-scale motion capture data. Most of existing
works, however, currently target animation of isolated people in empty scenes.
Meanwhile, synthesizing realistic human-object interactions in complex 3D
scenes remains a critical challenge in computer graphics and robotics. One
obstacle towards generating versatile high-fidelity human-object interactions
is the lack of large-scale datasets with diverse object manipulations. Indeed,
existing motion capture data is typically restricted to single people and
manipulations of limited sets of objects. To address this issue, we propose an
automatic motion extraction pipeline and use it to collect interaction-rich
human motions. Our new dataset InterPose contains 73.8K sequences of 3D human
motions and corresponding text captions automatically obtained from 45.8K
videos with human-object interactions. We perform extensive experiments and
demonstrate InterPose to bring significant improvements to state-of-the-art
methods for human motion generation. Moreover, using InterPose we develop an
LLM-based agent enabling zero-shot animation of people interacting with diverse
objects and scenes.

Motivation: 现代面部检索系统多外包给第三方，导致用户照片隐私风险。同态加密虽能提供强安全保障，但计算效率过低，不适合实时应用。

Method: 采用两阶段层次框架：(1)高速可变清产品量化索引模块用于快速候选过滤；(2)细粒度加密空间检索模块用于最终精确排名。设计了专门的保护机制确保索引模块的安全性和效率。

Result: 在标准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在效果、效率和安全性之间取得了良好的平衡。

Conclusion: 可变清产品量化框架为安全面部表征检索提供了高效的解决方案，有效解决了同态加密计算效率低的问题，同时保障用户隐私安全。

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of modern face retrieval systems, their retrieval stage
is often outsourced to third-party entities, posing significant risks to user
portrait privacy. Although homomorphic encryption (HE) offers strong security
guarantees by enabling arithmetic computations in the cipher space, its high
computational inefficiency makes it unsuitable for real-time, real-world
applications. To address this issue, we propose Cancelable Product
Quantization, a highly efficient framework for secure face representation
retrieval. Our hierarchical two-stage framework comprises: (i) a
high-throughput cancelable PQ indexing module for fast candidate filtering, and
(ii) a fine-grained cipher-space retrieval module for final precise face
ranking. A tailored protection mechanism is designed to secure the indexing
module for cancelable biometric authentication while ensuring efficiency.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an
decent balance between effectiveness, efficiency and security.

Result: 在多个数据集上的定量实验表明，该方法相比其他先进线段检测器能更有效地提取完整线段

Conclusion: AAGLSD是一种高效且有效的线段检测方法，避免了复杂的细化策略，在精度和完整性方面表现优异

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel line segment detector, the Aligned Anchor
Groups guided Line Segment Detector (AAGLSD), designed to detect line segments
from images with high precision and completeness. The algorithm employs a
hierarchical approach to extract candidate pixels with different saliency
levels, including regular anchors and aligned anchor groups. AAGLSD initiates
from these aligned anchor groups, sequentially linking anchors and updating the
currently predicted line segment simultaneously. The final predictions are
derived through straightforward validation and merging of adjacent line
segments, avoiding complex refinement strategies. AAGLSD is evaluated on
various datasets and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method can effectively extract complete line segments from input images
compared to other advanced line segment detectors. The implementation is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉假体在脑解码方面已有显著进展，但脑编码阶段生成的脑信号生物相似性不足，现有方法缺乏真实脑响应的监督验证，导致预测刺激质量受限。

Method: 使用预训练CLIP视觉编码器提取图像语义表示，结合交叉注意力增强的U-Net扩散模型，通过迭代去噪学习重建生物可信的脑信号，实现视觉特征与脑信号表示的细粒度对齐。

Conclusion: 所提出的交叉注意力增强扩散模型框架显著提升了脑信号生成的生物可信度，为视觉假体的脑编码阶段提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual prostheses have shown great potential in restoring vision for blind
individuals. On the one hand, researchers have been continuously improving the
brain decoding framework of visual prostheses by leveraging the powerful image
generation capabilities of diffusion models. On the other hand, the brain
encoding stage of visual prostheses struggles to generate brain signals with
sufficient biological similarity. Although existing works have recognized this
problem, the quality of predicted stimuli still remains a critical issue, as
existing approaches typically lack supervised signals from real brain responses
to validate the biological plausibility of predicted stimuli. To address this
issue, we propose a novel image-to-brain framework based on denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our
framework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP
visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images,
and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct
biologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike
conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for
conditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between
visual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained
alignment during the generation process. We evaluate our framework on two
multimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its
effectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Moreover, we
visualize the training and test M/EEG topographies for all subjects on both
datasets to intuitively demonstrate the intra-subject variations and
inter-subject variations in M/EEG signals.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了OmniReason框架，通过联合建模动态3D环境和决策过程来解决现有视觉语言模型在自动驾驶中忽略时间维度的问题，包含大规模数据集和创新架构，在多个任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型主要关注静态场景理解，忽略了真实驾驶场景中关键的时间维度，这限制了自动驾驶系统在动态环境中的表现。

Method: 开发了OmniReason-Data大规模数据集和OmniReason-Agent架构，包含幻觉缓解的自动标注流程、稀疏时间记忆模块和可解释决策生成器，采用时空知识蒸馏方法。

Result: 在开环规划任务和视觉问答基准测试中取得了显著改进，实现了最先进的性能，为复杂动态环境中的可解释、时间感知自动驾驶建立了新能力。

Conclusion: OmniReason框架成功解决了自动驾驶中时空推理的关键限制，通过大规模数据和创新架构实现了在动态环境中的鲁棒性能，为可解释的自动驾驶系统发展提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive
spatial reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving, yet existing methods
predominantly focus on static scene understanding while neglecting the
essential temporal dimension of real-world driving scenarios. To address this
critical limitation, we propose the OmniReason framework, which establishes
robust spatiotemporal reasoning by jointly modeling dynamic 3D environments and
their underlying decision-making processes. Our work makes two fundamental
advances: (1) We introduce OmniReason-Data, two large-scale
vision-language-action (VLA) datasets with dense spatiotemporal annotations and
natural language explanations, generated through a novel
hallucination-mitigated auto-labeling pipeline that ensures both physical
plausibility and temporal coherence; (2) We develop the OmniReason-Agent
architecture, which integrates a sparse temporal memory module for persistent
scene context modeling and an explanation generator that produces
human-interpretable decision rationales, facilitated by our spatiotemporal
knowledge distillation approach that effectively captures spatiotemporal causal
reasoning patterns. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance, where OmniReason-Agent achieves significant improvements in both
open-loop planning tasks and visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, while
establishing new capabilities for interpretable, temporally-aware autonomous
vehicles operating in complex, dynamic environments.

TL;DR: MI-RAG是一个多模态迭代检索增强生成框架，通过迭代检索和推理提升知识密集型视觉问答的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在处理需要外部知识的视觉问答任务时表现有限，传统的单次检索框架往往无法获取足够的知识

Method: 提出多模态迭代RAG框架，每轮迭代利用累积的推理记录动态生成多查询，在异构知识库中进行联合搜索，并将新知识整合到推理记录中

Result: 在Encyclopedic VQA、InfoSeek和OK-VQA等基准测试中，显著提高了检索召回率和答案准确率

Conclusion: MI-RAG为知识密集型视觉问答提供了一个可扩展的组合推理方法

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
multimodal understanding, their performance remains limited on
knowledge-intensive visual questions that require external knowledge beyond the
image. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for
providing models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass
framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this
limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that
leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and update reasoning over newly
retrieved knowledge across modalities. At each iteration, MI-RAG leverages an
accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query. These
queries then drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases
containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. The newly acquired
knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, progressively refining
understanding across iterations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks,
including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG
significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing
a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.

Motivation: 水下环境存在光线失真、浑浊度和能见度限制等问题，现有AI方法未能充分利用语言模型与视觉处理的结合潜力

Method: 在多模态交叉知识基础上，将语义特征嵌入高斯基元，通过CLIP提取的语义特征进行监督，采用分阶段训练策略（粗到细学习+后期参数优化）

Result: 在SeaThru-NeRF和Submerged3D数据集上全面超越现有方法，PSNR平均提升达3.09 dB

Conclusion: 该方法为水下探索和海洋感知应用提供了强有力的候选方案，实现了语义和结构感知的高保真水下场景重建

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction in underwater environments remains a complex
challenge due to issues such as light distortion, turbidity, and limited
visibility. AI-based techniques have been applied to address these issues,
however, existing methods have yet to fully exploit the potential of AI,
particularly in integrating language models with visual processing. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages multimodal cross-knowledge
to create semantic-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for robust and high-fidelity
deep-sea scene reconstruction. By embedding an extra semantic feature into each
Gaussian primitive and supervised by the CLIP extracted semantic feature, our
method enforces semantic and structural awareness throughout the training. The
dedicated semantic consistency loss ensures alignment with high-level scene
understanding. Besides, we propose a novel stage-wise training strategy,
combining coarse-to-fine learning with late-stage parameter refinement, to
further enhance both stability and reconstruction quality. Extensive results
show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
SeaThru-NeRF and Submerged3D datasets across three metrics, with an improvement
of up to 3.09 dB on average in terms of PSNR, making it a strong candidate for
applications in underwater exploration and marine perception.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种插入式的适应性对比度调节模块(ACAM)，通过模拟医生调整图像对比度的临床实践，提升胎儿超声标准分析面的分类性能。该模块在多个模型上均实现了性能提升，尤其在轻量级模型上准确率提高了2.02%。


<details>

Motivation: 胎儿超声标准分析面分类面临低组织对比度、边界模糊和操作者依赖性图像质量变化等挑战，需要提升分析的可靠性。

Method: 设计了一种插入式适应性对比度调节模块(ACAM)，使用浅层纹理敏感网络预测临床可行的对比度参数，通过可微分映射将输入图像转换为多个对比度增强视图，并在下游分类器中融合这些视图。

Result: 在多中心数据集(12,400张图像，6个解剖学类别)上验证，该模块在各种模型上均提升了性能：轻量级模型准确率提高2.02%，传统模型提高1.29%，最先进模型提高1.15%。

Conclusion: 该模块通过内容感知适应能力，用物理信息变换替代随机预处理，符合超声医生工作流程，通过多视图融合提高了对形成异质性的鲁棒性，为医学图像分析在实际图像质量变化情况下提供了新的范式。

Abstract: Fetal ultrasound standard plane classification is essential for reliable
prenatal diagnosis but faces inherent challenges, including low tissue
contrast, boundary ambiguity, and operator-dependent image quality variations.
To overcome these limitations, we propose a plug-and-play adaptive contrast
adjustment module (ACAM), whose core design is inspired by the clinical
practice of doctors adjusting image contrast to obtain clearer and more
discriminative structural information. The module employs a shallow
texture-sensitive network to predict clinically plausible contrast parameters,
transforms input images into multiple contrast-enhanced views through
differentiable mapping, and fuses them within downstream classifiers. Validated
on a multi-center dataset of 12,400 images across six anatomical categories,
the module consistently improves performance across diverse models, with
accuracy of lightweight models increasing by 2.02 percent, accuracy of
traditional models increasing by 1.29 percent, and accuracy of state-of-the-art
models increasing by 1.15 percent. The innovation of the module lies in its
content-aware adaptation capability, replacing random preprocessing with
physics-informed transformations that align with sonographer workflows while
improving robustness to imaging heterogeneity through multi-view fusion. This
approach effectively bridges low-level image features with high-level
semantics, establishing a new paradigm for medical image analysis under
real-world image quality variations.

Motivation: 需要更有效的对抗攻击方法来评估计算机视觉模型的鲁棒性，重构对抗样本生成的优化目标

Method: 建立"循环-阶段-步骤"三层优化框架，使用负真实标签概率损失函数压缩解空间，引入方向概率差异比(DPDR)损失函数逐步增加非真实标签概率上界

Result: 相比之前SOTA方法，SDM表现出更强的攻击性能和更高的攻击成本效益，还能与对抗训练方法结合提升防御效果

Conclusion: SDM是一种高效的梯度基攻击方法，在攻击效果和成本效益方面均有显著提升，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Efficient adversarial attack methods are critical for assessing the
robustness of computer vision models. In this paper, we reconstruct the
optimization objective for generating adversarial examples as "maximizing the
difference between the non-true labels' probability upper bound and the true
label's probability," and propose a gradient-based attack method termed
Sequential Difference Maximization (SDM). SDM establishes a three-layer
optimization framework of "cycle-stage-step." The processes between cycles and
between iterative steps are respectively identical, while optimization stages
differ in terms of loss functions: in the initial stage, the negative
probability of the true label is used as the loss function to compress the
solution space; in subsequent stages, we introduce the Directional Probability
Difference Ratio (DPDR) loss function to gradually increase the non-true
labels' probability upper bound by compressing the irrelevant labels'
probabilities. Experiments demonstrate that compared with previous SOTA
methods, SDM not only exhibits stronger attack performance but also achieves
higher attack cost-effectiveness. Additionally, SDM can be combined with
adversarial training methods to enhance their defensive effects. The code is
available at https://github.com/X-L-Liu/SDM.

Motivation: 解决纹理表面缺陷检测中背景噪声干扰和缺陷边界模糊的问题，提高在噪声环境下的检测鲁棒性。

Method: 结合U-Net的局部特征训练和ViT的全局处理能力，使用高斯滤波损失函数去除背景噪声，采用盐椒噪声掩码强化纹理-缺陷边界，后处理使用Gabor滤波器突出缺陷方向频率特征。

Result: 在MVTec-AD、表面裂纹检测和大理石表面异常数据集上实现了0.939的平均AUC，消融实验验证了最优滤波器尺寸和噪声概率对性能的显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多技术融合有效提升了纹理表面缺陷检测性能，特别是在噪声环境下表现出色，为工业检测提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the accuracy and reliability
of texture-based surface defect detection using Gabor filters and a blurring
U-Net-ViT model. By combining the local feature training of U-Net with the
global processing of the Vision Transformer(ViT), the model effectively detects
defects across various textures. A Gaussian filter-based loss function removes
background noise and highlights defect patterns, while Salt-and-Pepper(SP)
masking in the training process reinforces texture-defect boundaries, ensuring
robust performance in noisy environments. Gabor filters are applied in
post-processing to emphasize defect orientation and frequency characteristics.
Parameter optimization, including filter size, sigma, wavelength, gamma, and
orientation, maximizes performance across datasets like MVTec-AD, Surface Crack
Detection, and Marble Surface Anomaly Dataset, achieving an average Area Under
the Curve(AUC) of 0.939. The ablation studies validate that the optimal filter
size and noise probability significantly enhance defect detection performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常采用两步流程（先估计相机位姿再优化3D高斯），但运动模糊会破坏位姿估计，导致误差累积和重建质量下降。

Method: 将相机和物体运动重新表述为3D高斯的每基元SE(3)仿射变换，提出统一优化目标。采用三阶段训练策略：先固定位姿训练高斯，再固定高斯优化位姿，最后联合优化所有参数。

Result: 在Stereo Blur数据集和真实世界序列上的实验表明，该方法在重建质量和位姿估计精度方面显著优于现有动态去模糊方法。

Conclusion: 该统一优化框架通过联合优化相机位姿和3D高斯属性，有效解决了运动模糊导致的动态3D场景重建问题，取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video has broad applications
in AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous navigation, but often fails due to severe
motion blur caused by camera and object motion. Existing methods commonly
follow a two-step pipeline, where camera poses are first estimated and then 3D
Gaussians are optimized. Since blurring artifacts usually undermine pose
estimation, pose errors could be accumulated to produce inferior reconstruction
results. To address this issue, we introduce a unified optimization framework
by incorporating camera poses as learnable parameters complementary to 3DGS
attributes for end-to-end optimization. Specifically, we recast camera and
object motion as per-primitive SE(3) affine transformations on 3D Gaussians and
formulate a unified optimization objective. For stable optimization, we
introduce a three-stage training schedule that optimizes camera poses and
Gaussians alternatively. Particularly, 3D Gaussians are first trained with
poses being fixed, and then poses are optimized with 3D Gaussians being
untouched. Finally, all learnable parameters are optimized together. Extensive
experiments on the Stereo Blur dataset and challenging real-world sequences
demonstrate that our method achieves significant gains in reconstruction
quality and pose estimation accuracy over prior dynamic deblurring methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegDINO是一个高效的分割框架，将冻结的DINOv3主干网络与轻量级解码器结合，在多个分割基准测试中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DINO自监督视觉模型具有出色的可迁移性，但现有分割方法通常依赖重型解码器，导致参数开销和计算成本过高。

Method: 从预训练编码器提取多级特征，对齐到统一分辨率和通道宽度，使用轻量级MLP头直接预测分割掩码。

Result: 在6个基准测试（包括3个医学数据集和3个自然图像数据集）上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SegDINO设计在最小化可训练参数的同时保持了基础特征的表示能力，提供了高效的分割解决方案。

Abstract: The DINO family of self-supervised vision models has shown remarkable
transferability, yet effectively adapting their representations for
segmentation remains challenging. Existing approaches often rely on heavy
decoders with multi-scale fusion or complex upsampling, which introduce
substantial parameter overhead and computational cost. In this work, we propose
SegDINO, an efficient segmentation framework that couples a frozen DINOv3
backbone with a lightweight decoder. SegDINO extracts multi-level features from
the pretrained encoder, aligns them to a common resolution and channel width,
and utilizes a lightweight MLP head to directly predict segmentation masks.
This design minimizes trainable parameters while preserving the
representational power of foundation features. Extensive experiments across six
benchmarks, including three medical datasets (TN3K, Kvasir-SEG, ISIC) and three
natural image datasets (MSD, VMD-D, ViSha), demonstrate that SegDINO
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
methods. Code is available at https://github.com/script-Yang/SegDINO.

Result: 在RICE数据集上达到PSNR 33.24dB和SSIM 0.967，显著超过现有方法，在SateHaze1K数据集上也表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效减少卫星图像中的大气干扰，保持结构一致性，在多种大气条件下都能实现稳健的去霜效果，具有广泛的遥感应用潜力。

Abstract: Satellite imagery plays a crucial role in various fields; however,
atmospheric interference and haze significantly degrade image clarity and
reduce the accuracy of information extraction. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes a hybrid dehazing framework that integrates Swin
Transformer and U-Net to balance global context learning and local detail
restoration, called SUFERNOBWA. The proposed network employs SwinRRDB, a Swin
Transformer-based Residual-in-Residual Dense Block, in both the encoder and
decoder to effectively extract features. This module enables the joint learning
of global contextual information and fine spatial structures, which is crucial
for structural preservation in satellite image. Furthermore, we introduce a
composite loss function that combines L2 loss, guided loss, and a novel
watershed loss, which enhances structural boundary preservation and ensures
pixel-level accuracy. This architecture enables robust dehazing under diverse
atmospheric conditions while maintaining structural consistency across restored
images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art models on both the RICE and SateHaze1K datasets. Specifically,
on the RICE dataset, the proposed approach achieved a PSNR of 33.24 dB and an
SSIM of 0.967, which is a significant improvement over existing method. This
study provides an effective solution for mitigating atmospheric interference in
satellite imagery and highlights its potential applicability across diverse
remote sensing applications.

*Xueyang Kang,Zhengkang Xiang,Zezheng Zhang,Kourosh Khoshelham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种将单视图新视角合成分解为360度场景外推和视角插值的两阶段方法，通过全景扩散模型和视频扩散模型生成全局一致的新视角


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单图像新视角合成中由于大范围未观测区域导致的视角一致性差、长距离轨迹和闭环场景中视角对齐不正确的问题

Method: 第一阶段使用全景扩散模型从输入图像学习场景先验，第二阶段从生成的全景图中采样并扭曲关键帧，使用预训练视频扩散模型通过空间噪声扩散过程生成新视角

Result: 在多样化场景数据集上的实验表明，该方法在用户定义轨迹上生成连贯视图方面优于现有方法，即使在闭环场景中也能保持全局一致性

Conclusion: 该方法通过分解策略和关键帧条件化，有效解决了单视图新视角合成的长期视角和场景一致性问题，同时支持灵活的相机控制

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) from a single image is highly ill-posed due to
large unobserved regions, especially for views that deviate significantly from
the input. While existing methods focus on consistency between the source and
generated views, they often fail to maintain coherence and correct view
alignment across long-range or looped trajectories. We propose a model that
addresses this by decomposing single-view NVS into a 360-degree scene
extrapolation followed by novel view interpolation. This design ensures
long-term view and scene consistency by conditioning on keyframes extracted and
warped from a generated panoramic representation. In the first stage, a
panorama diffusion model learns the scene prior from the input perspective
image. Perspective keyframes are then sampled and warped from the panorama and
used as anchor frames in a pre-trained video diffusion model, which generates
novel views through a proposed spatial noise diffusion process. Compared to
prior work, our method produces globally consistent novel views -- even in loop
closure scenarios -- while enabling flexible camera control. Experiments on
diverse scene datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
methods in generating coherent views along user-defined trajectories. Our
implementation is available at https://github.com/YiGuYT/LookBeyond.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出FQAT方法，通过层间冻结机制和自适应冻结算法解决量化训练中OOD泛化性能下降的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量化感知训练方法主要关注ID数据性能，忽视了OOD数据上的性能退化问题。实验证实QAT会导致显著的OOD泛化性能下降

Method: 提出FQAT方法：1）引入层间冻结机制缓解双重优化目标间的梯度冲突；2）设计基于梯度无序度的自适应冻结算法动态确定冻结层；3）提出梯度无序度指标识别训练中的不稳定层

Result: 在多个有影响力的OOD基准测试上，FQAT在ID和OOD图像分类任务中都优于现有最先进基线方法

Conclusion: FQAT通过关注损失景观的平坦性，成功解决了量化训练中的OOD泛化问题，为可泛化的量化感知训练提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Current quantization-aware training (QAT) methods primarily focus on
enhancing the performance of quantized models on in-distribution (I.D) data,
while overlooking the potential performance degradation on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data. In this paper, we first substantiate this problem through rigorous
experiment, showing that QAT can lead to a significant OOD generalization
performance degradation. Further, we find the contradiction between the
perspective that flatness of loss landscape gives rise to superior OOD
generalization and the phenomenon that QAT lead to a sharp loss landscape, can
cause the above problem. Therefore, we propose a flatness-oriented QAT method,
FQAT, to achieve generalizable QAT. Specifically, i) FQAT introduces a
layer-wise freezing mechanism to mitigate the gradient conflict issue between
dual optimization objectives (i.e., vanilla QAT and flatness). ii) FQAT
proposes an disorder-guided adaptive freezing algorithm to dynamically
determines which layers to freeze at each training step, effectively addressing
the challenges caused by interference between layers. A gradient disorder
metric is designed to help the algorithm identify unstable layers during
training. Extensive experiments on influential OOD benchmark demonstrate the
superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under both I.D and
OOD image classification tasks.

*Zirui Zhou,Zizhao Peng,Dongyang Jin,Chao Fan,Fengwei An,Shiqi Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Scoliosis1K-Pose数据集和双表征框架(DRF)，通过结合连续骨架图和离散姿态不对称向量来解决基于姿态的脊柱侧弯筛查问题，取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI脊柱侧弯筛查方法主要依赖轮廓数据集，忽略了临床相关的姿态不对称性。姿态数据虽然能提供直观的骨骼表示，但由于大规模标注数据集稀缺和原始姿态坐标的离散噪声敏感性，基于姿态的筛查研究不足。

Method: 1) 扩展Scoliosis1K数据集创建Scoliosis1K-Pose，包含447,900帧2D关键点；2) 提出双表征框架(DRF)，整合连续骨架图和离散姿态不对称向量(PAV)；3) 设计PAV引导注意力(PGA)模块，利用PAV作为临床先验指导特征提取。

Result: 大量实验证明DRF实现了最先进的性能。可视化证实模型利用临床不对称线索指导特征提取，并促进双表征之间的协同作用。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了基于姿态的脊柱侧弯筛查的两个主要挑战，数据集和代码已公开提供，有助于推动该领域的研究发展。

Abstract: Recent AI-based scoliosis screening methods primarily rely on large-scale
silhouette datasets, often neglecting clinically relevant postural
asymmetries-key indicators in traditional screening. In contrast, pose data
provide an intuitive skeletal representation, enhancing clinical
interpretability across various medical applications. However, pose-based
scoliosis screening remains underexplored due to two main challenges: (1) the
scarcity of large-scale, annotated pose datasets; and (2) the discrete and
noise-sensitive nature of raw pose coordinates, which hinders the modeling of
subtle asymmetries. To address these limitations, we introduce
Scoliosis1K-Pose, a 2D human pose annotation set that extends the original
Scoliosis1K dataset, comprising 447,900 frames of 2D keypoints from 1,050
adolescents. Building on this dataset, we introduce the Dual Representation
Framework (DRF), which integrates a continuous skeleton map to preserve spatial
structure with a discrete Postural Asymmetry Vector (PAV) that encodes
clinically relevant asymmetry descriptors. A novel PAV-Guided Attention (PGA)
module further uses the PAV as clinical prior to direct feature extraction from
the skeleton map, focusing on clinically meaningful asymmetries. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DRF achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Visualizations further confirm that the model leverages clinical asymmetry cues
to guide feature extraction and promote synergy between its dual
representations. The dataset and code are publicly available at
https://zhouzi180.github.io/Scoliosis1K/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Spotlighter是一个轻量级的token选择框架，通过评估视觉token的激活度并保留高分token来提升提示调优的准确性和效率，在11个少样本基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP的成功证明了提示调优可以实现跨模态语义对齐，但冗余或弱相关的特征组件会引入噪声并增加不必要的计算成本。

Method: Spotlighter从样本级和语义级两个角度评估每个视觉token的激活度，只保留得分最高的token用于下游预测。使用类别特定的语义记忆库来精化选择，并引入两级排名机制动态加权token-原型交互。

Result: 在11个少样本基准测试中，Spotlighter比CLIP在调和平均准确率上提升高达11.19%，同时达到额外0.8K FPS，仅增加21个参数。

Conclusion: Spotlighter被证明是提示调优中有效且可扩展的基线方法，在准确性和效率方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: CLIP's success has demonstrated that prompt tuning can achieve robust
cross-modal semantic alignment for tasks ranging from open-domain recognition
to fine-grained classification. However, redundant or weakly relevant feature
components introduce noise and incur unnecessary computational costs. In this
work, we propose Spotlighter, a lightweight token-selection framework that
simultaneously enhances accuracy and efficiency in prompt tuning. Spotlighter
evaluates each visual token's activation from both sample-wise and
semantic-wise perspectives and retains only the top-scoring tokens for
downstream prediction. A class-specific semantic memory bank of learned
prototypes refines this selection, ensuring semantic representativeness and
compensating for discarded features. To further prioritize informative signals,
we introduce a two-level ranking mechanism that dynamically weights
token--prototype interactions. Across 11 few-shot benchmarks, Spotlighter
outperforms CLIP by up to 11.19\% in harmonic mean accuracy and achieves up to
0.8K additional FPS, with only 21 extra parameters. These results establish
Spotlighter as an effective and scalable baseline for prompt tuning. Code for
our method will be available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了增量补丁生成(IPG)方法，比现有方法效率提高11.1倍，同时保持相当的对抗攻击性能，生成的补丁能有效覆盖更广泛的模型漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性补丁对AI模型鲁棒性构成重大挑战，特别是在目标检测等计算机视觉任务中，这些补丁针对图像的特定区域导致AI模型故障。

Method: 提出增量补丁生成(IPG)方法，通过实验和消融研究验证其有效性，包括YOLO特征分布可视化和对抗训练结果分析。

Result: IPG方法生成效率比现有方法高11.1倍，产生泛化性好的补丁，能有效覆盖更广泛的模型漏洞，生成的对抗数据集可作为构建鲁棒模型的知识基础。

Conclusion: IPG在对抗补丁防御和实际应用（如自动驾驶、安全系统、医学成像）中具有巨大潜力，能使AI模型在动态高风险环境中保持对对抗攻击的韧性。

Abstract: The advent of adversarial patches poses a significant challenge to the
robustness of AI models, particularly in the domain of computer vision tasks
such as object detection. In contradistinction to traditional adversarial
examples, these patches target specific regions of an image, resulting in the
malfunction of AI models. This paper proposes Incremental Patch Generation
(IPG), a method that generates adversarial patches up to 11.1 times more
efficiently than existing approaches while maintaining comparable attack
performance. The efficacy of IPG is demonstrated by experiments and ablation
studies including YOLO's feature distribution visualization and adversarial
training results, which show that it produces well-generalized patches that
effectively cover a broader range of model vulnerabilities. Furthermore,
IPG-generated datasets can serve as a robust knowledge foundation for
constructing a robust model, enabling structured representation, advanced
reasoning, and proactive defenses in AI security ecosystems. The findings of
this study suggest that IPG has considerable potential for future utilization
not only in adversarial patch defense but also in real-world applications such
as autonomous vehicles, security systems, and medical imaging, where AI models
must remain resilient to adversarial attacks in dynamic and high-stakes
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DarkVRAI是一个针对低光照RAW视频去噪的新框架，通过条件化方案和Burst-Order Selective Scan机制，在AIM 2025挑战赛中取得第一名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低光照RAW视频由于高传感器增益和短曝光时间导致的严重信号退化问题，这些限制源于视频帧率要求。

Method: 提出两个主要贡献：1) 将图像去噪的条件化方案成功应用于视频去噪，利用捕获元数据指导对齐和去噪过程；2) 提出Burst-Order Selective Scan (BOSS)机制，有效建模噪声视频序列中的长程时间依赖性。

Result: 在严格且真实的基准数据集上展示了最先进的性能，为低光照视频去噪设立了新标准。

Conclusion: 通过协同结合条件化方案和BOSS机制，DarkVRAI框架在低光照RAW视频去噪任务中取得了突破性进展。

Abstract: Low-light RAW video denoising is a fundamentally challenging task due to
severe signal degradation caused by high sensor gain and short exposure times,
which are inherently limited by video frame rate requirements. To address this,
we propose DarkVRAI, a novel framework that achieved first place in the AIM
2025 Low-light RAW Video Denoising Challenge. Our method introduces two primary
contributions: (1) a successful application of a conditioning scheme for image
denoising, which explicitly leverages capture metadata, to video denoising to
guide the alignment and denoising processes, and (2) a Burst-Order Selective
Scan (BOSS) mechanism that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies
within the noisy video sequence. By synergistically combining these components,
DarkVRAI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a rigorous and realistic
benchmark dataset, setting a new standard for low-light video denoising.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LangDC是一种语言感知的动态token压缩器，通过轻量级语言模型生成视频片段的软描述token作为视觉表示，根据场景丰富度动态调整压缩比例，在减少49%计算量的同时保持竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频token压缩策略采用固定压缩比例，忽略了不同视频片段语义密度的差异性，导致信息丰富片段表示不足而静态片段计算浪费。

Method: 使用轻量级语言模型描述视频片段生成软描述token作为视觉表示，通过语义密度感知监督训练，动态调整压缩比例（描述长度反映场景丰富度）。

Result: 相比VideoGPT+减少49%的FLOPs计算量，同时保持竞争性性能，定性结果显示能根据视频片段丰富度自适应调整压缩比例。

Conclusion: LangDC模仿人类动态表达视觉信息的方式，实现了高效且自适应的视频token压缩，在计算效率和性能之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large video-language models have revolutionized video
understanding tasks. However, their efficiency is significantly constrained by
processing high volumes of visual tokens. Existing token compression strategies
apply a fixed compression ratio, ignoring the variability in semantic density
among different video clips. Consequently, this lead to inadequate
representation of information-rich clips due to insufficient tokens and
unnecessary computation on static or content-poor ones. To address this, we
propose LangDC, a Language-aware Dynamic Token Compressor. LangDC leverages a
lightweight language model to describe video clips, converting them into soft
caption tokens as visual representations. Trained with our proposed semantic
density-aware supervision, LangDC aims to 1) cover key visual cues necessary
for downstream task reasoning and 2) dynamically adjust compression ratios
based on scene richness, reflected by descriptions length. Our design mimics
how humans dynamically express what they see: complex scenes (seeing more)
elicit more detailed language to convey nuances (saying more), whereas simpler
scenes are described with fewer words. Experimental results show that our
method reduces FLOPs by 49% compared to VideoGPT+ while maintaining competitive
performance. Furthermore, qualitative results demonstrate our approach
adaptively adjusts the token compression ratio based on video segment richness.

TL;DR: 研究如何在3D高斯拷布(3DGS)框架中集成RGB和多光谱图像，提出了三种策略并验证联合优化策略的有效性，通过在球面谐波颜色组件中直接集成多光谱数据来提高多模态重建质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS在RGB数据上表现优异，但对多光谱数据进行每波段独立优化会导致重建质量差，因为虽然实际几何结构相同，但在光谱域中出现不一致性问题

Method: 评估三种策略：1)独立每波段重建无共享结构 2)分段优化：先优化RGB几何，复制后优化每个新波段 3)联合优化：多模态联合优化，可选先进行RGB单模态初始化

Result: 联合优化策略在多光谱数据集上通过定量指标和定性新视角渲染验证有效性，提高了整体光谱重建质量，并通过光谱交相作用增强了RGB结果

Conclusion: 建议将多光谱数据直接集成到球面谐波颜色组件中，以紧凑模型化每个高斯分布的多光谱反射特性，分析还揭示了优化过程中引入光谱波段的关键批换和实践见解

Abstract: We present a study of how to integrate color (RGB) and multi-spectral imagery
(red, green, red-edge, and near-infrared) into the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
framework, a state-of-the-art explicit radiance-field-based method for fast and
high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. While 3DGS excels on
RGB data, naive per-band optimization of additional spectra yields poor
reconstructions due to inconsistently appearing geometry in the spectral
domain. This problem is prominent, even though the actual geometry is the same,
regardless of spectral modality. To investigate this, we evaluate three
strategies: 1) Separate per-band reconstruction with no shared structure. 2)
Splitting optimization, in which we first optimize RGB geometry, copy it, and
then fit each new band to the model by optimizing both geometry and band
representation. 3) Joint, in which the modalities are jointly optimized,
optionally with an initial RGB-only phase. We showcase through quantitative
metrics and qualitative novel-view renderings on multi-spectral datasets the
effectiveness of our dedicated optimized Joint strategy, increasing overall
spectral reconstruction as well as enhancing RGB results through spectral
cross-talk. We therefore suggest integrating multi-spectral data directly into
the spherical harmonics color components to compactly model each Gaussian's
multi-spectral reflectance. Moreover, our analysis reveals several key
trade-offs in when and how to introduce spectral bands during optimization,
offering practical insights for robust multi-modal 3DGS reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 雨天显著增加交通事故风险，了解驾驶员在恶劣天气下的视觉注意模式对于设计鲁棒的驾驶员监控系统(DMS)和高级驾驶辅助系统(ADAS)至关重要。

Method: 采用两步聚类方法：首先在10秒间隔内对注视点进行聚类，然后将聚类中心聚合成元聚类，结合马尔可夫转移矩阵、注视持续时间、视线仰角和方位角分布等指标进行分析。

Result: 雨天条件下驾驶员表现出更频繁的仪表盘检查、更长的注视持续时间、更高的视线仰角，整体注视行为仍以道路为主并偶尔检查后视镜。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了恶劣天气下视觉注意模式的变化，强调了利用注视建模辅助设计更鲁棒的ADAS和DMS的潜力。

Abstract: Rainy weather significantly increases the risk of road accidents due to
reduced visibility and vehicle traction. Understanding how experienced drivers
adapt their visual perception through gaze behavior under such conditions is
critical for designing robust driver monitoring systems (DMS) and for informing
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). This case study investigates the eye
gaze behavior of a driver operating the same highway route under both clear and
rainy conditions. To this end, gaze behavior was analyzed by a two-step
clustering approach: first, clustering gaze points within 10-second intervals,
and then aggregating cluster centroids into meta-clusters. This, along with
Markov transition matrices and metrics such as fixation duration, gaze
elevation, and azimuth distributions, reveals meaningful behavioral shifts.
While the overall gaze behavior focused on the road with occasional mirror
checks remains consistent, rainy conditions lead to more frequent dashboard
glances, longer fixation durations, and higher gaze elevation, indicating
increased cognitive focus. These findings offer valuable insight into visual
attention patterns under adverse conditions and highlight the potential of
leveraging gaze modeling to aid in the design of more robust ADAS and DMS.

TL;DR: CompSlider是一个基于滑块的文本到图像生成方法，通过解耦多个属性来实现精确的多属性同时控制，无需重新训练基础模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的滑块方法通常为每个属性单独训练适配器，忽略了多个属性之间的纠缠问题，导致不同属性间存在干扰，无法实现精确的多属性同时控制。

Method: CompSlider生成条件先验来控制多个属性，引入解耦损失和结构损失来组合多个属性变化，同时保持图像结构一致性。该方法在条件先验的潜在空间中操作，无需重新训练基础模型。

Result: 该方法在多种图像属性上进行了评估，并扩展到视频生成，展示了其通用性。

Conclusion: CompSlider通过解耦多个属性，实现了更可靠和独立的属性操作，同时降低了训练和推理的计算负担。

Abstract: In text-to-image (T2I) generation, achieving fine-grained control over
attributes - such as age or smile - remains challenging, even with detailed
text prompts. Slider-based methods offer a solution for precise control of
image attributes. Existing approaches typically train individual adapter for
each attribute separately, overlooking the entanglement among multiple
attributes. As a result, interference occurs among different attributes,
preventing precise control of multiple attributes together. To address this
challenge, we aim to disentangle multiple attributes in slider-based generation
to enbale more reliable and independent attribute manipulation. Our approach,
CompSlider, can generate a conditional prior for the T2I foundation model to
control multiple attributes simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce novel
disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes
while maintaining structural consistency within the image. Since CompSlider
operates in the latent space of the conditional prior and does not require
retraining the foundation model, it reduces the computational burden for both
training and inference. We evaluate our approach on a variety of image
attributes and highlight its generality by extending to video generation.

Abstract: Images taken through window glass are often degraded by contaminants adhered
to the glass surfaces. Such contaminants cause occlusions that attenuate the
incoming light and scatter stray light towards the camera. Most of existing
deep learning methods for neutralizing the effects of contaminated glasses
relied on synthetic training data. Few researchers used real degraded and clean
image pairs, but they only considered removing or alleviating the effects of
rain drops on glasses. This paper is concerned with the more challenging task
of learning the restoration of images taken through glasses contaminated by a
wide range of occluders, including muddy water, dirt and other small foreign
particles found in reality. To facilitate the learning task we have gone to a
great length to acquire real paired images with and without glass contaminants.
More importantly, we propose an all-in-one model to neutralize contaminants of
different types by utilizing the one-shot test-time adaptation mechanism. It
involves a self-supervised auxiliary learning task to update the trained model
for the unique occlusion type of each test image. Experimental results show
that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
quantitatively and qualitatively in cleaning realistic contaminated images,
especially the unseen ones.

TL;DR: 提出了首个统一的低级别病理学基础模型LPFM，通过对比预训练编码器和条件扩散过程，能够处理图像恢复（超分辨率、去模糊、去噪）和虚拟染色等多种低级别视觉任务，在大多数任务上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型在高级诊断任务上表现出色，但低级别图像增强问题未得到充分解决。真实病理图像存在噪声、模糊、低分辨率等退化问题，且物理染色成本高、耗时长、不一致。现有方法针对单一任务设计，缺乏处理多样化低级别视觉挑战的通用性。

Method: 使用对比预训练编码器从1.9亿张未标记病理图像中学习可迁移、染色不变的特征表示；采用统一的条件扩散过程，通过文本提示动态适应特定任务；在87,810张全切片图像（34种组织类型，5种染色方案）上训练。

Result: 在大多数任务（56/66）上显著优于最先进方法（p<0.01），图像恢复任务的PSNR提升10-15%，虚拟染色任务的SSIM提升12-18%。

Conclusion: LPFM是首个统一的低级别病理学基础模型，能够有效处理多种图像增强任务，为病理学图像处理提供了通用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computational pathology by achieving
remarkable success in high-level diagnostic tasks, yet the critical challenge
of low-level image enhancement remains largely unaddressed. Real-world
pathology images frequently suffer from degradations such as noise, blur, and
low resolution due to slide preparation artifacts, staining variability, and
imaging constraints, while the reliance on physical staining introduces
significant costs, delays, and inconsistency. Although existing methods target
individual problems like denoising or super-resolution, their task-specific
designs lack the versatility to handle the diverse low-level vision challenges
encountered in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose the first unified
Low-level Pathology Foundation Model (LPFM), capable of enhancing image quality
in restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising, as
well as facilitating image translation tasks like virtual staining (H&E and
special stains), all through a single adaptable architecture. Our approach
introduces a contrastive pre-trained encoder that learns transferable,
stain-invariant feature representations from 190 million unlabeled pathology
images, enabling robust identification of degradation patterns. A unified
conditional diffusion process dynamically adapts to specific tasks via textual
prompts, ensuring precise control over output quality. Trained on a curated
dataset of 87,810 whole slied images (WSIs) across 34 tissue types and 5
staining protocols, LPFM demonstrates statistically significant improvements
(p<0.01) over state-of-the-art methods in most tasks (56/66), achieving Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gains of 10-15% for image restoration and
Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) improvements of 12-18% for virtual
staining.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像异常检测需要高效率和准确性，但CNN感受野有限，Transformer计算成本过高。Mamba在自然语言处理中展现的线性复杂度处理长序列能力为医学图像检测提供了新思路。

Method: 提出SpectMamba架构，包含混合空间-频率注意力块（HSFA）分别学习高低频特征，视觉状态空间模块（VSSM）和Hilbert曲线扫描技术来增强空间相关性和局部依赖关系。

Result: 在多种医学图像检测任务中实现了最先进的性能，同时保持了高效性。

Conclusion: SpectMamba成功将Mamba架构应用于医学图像检测，通过频率-空间特征融合和优化的扫描策略，在计算效率和检测精度方面都表现出色，为医学图像分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Abnormality detection in medical imaging is a critical task requiring both
high efficiency and accuracy to support effective diagnosis. While
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models are widely
used, both face intrinsic challenges: CNNs have limited receptive fields,
restricting their ability to capture broad contextual information, and
Transformers encounter prohibitive computational costs when processing
high-resolution medical images. Mamba, a recent innovation in natural language
processing, has gained attention for its ability to process long sequences with
linear complexity, offering a promising alternative. Building on this
foundation, we present SpectMamba, the first Mamba-based architecture designed
for medical image detection. A key component of SpectMamba is the Hybrid
Spatial-Frequency Attention (HSFA) block, which separately learns high- and
low-frequency features. This approach effectively mitigates the loss of
high-frequency information caused by frequency bias and correlates
frequency-domain features with spatial features, thereby enhancing the model's
ability to capture global context. To further improve long-range dependencies,
we propose the Visual State-Space Module (VSSM) and introduce a novel Hilbert
Curve Scanning technique to strengthen spatial correlations and local
dependencies, further optimizing the Mamba framework. Comprehensive experiments
show that SpectMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance while being both
effective and efficient across various medical image detection tasks.

Motivation: 视频扩散Transformer模型在生成高质量视频时面临计算瓶颈，全注意力的二次复杂度导致训练和推理成本过高，需要解决查询和键值对的稀疏性问题

Method: BSA框架包含两个关键组件：通过语义相似性和动态时空训练策略优化查询稀疏性，通过统计动态阈值保留最显著的键值块来实现KV稀疏性

Conclusion: BSA框架有效解决了视频DiT模型的计算效率问题，为高分辨率长视频生成提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit
major computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration
videos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high
training and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key
challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and
Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to
leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training,
the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D
full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference
efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query
sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via
semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV
sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain
only the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long
sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention
training, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full
attention.

Method: 提出VEPE框架，包含三个核心时空Transformer组件：时空姿态编码器(STPE)、时空可变形记忆编码器(STDME)、时空姿态解码器(STPD)，并引入实例一致性机制来增强跨帧实例查询的一致性和差异性。

Result: 在Posetrack数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法优于大多数两阶段模型，并将推理效率提高了300%。

Conclusion: VEPE提供了一个简单灵活的端到端视频姿态估计解决方案，通过有效利用时空上下文和实例一致性机制，在准确性和效率方面都取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Video-based human pose estimation models aim to address scenarios that cannot
be effectively solved by static image models such as motion blur, out-of-focus
and occlusion. Most existing approaches consist of two stages: detecting human
instances in each image frame and then using a temporal model for single-person
pose estimation. This approach separates the spatial and temporal dimensions
and cannot capture the global spatio-temporal context between spatial instances
for end-to-end optimization. In addition, it relies on separate detectors and
complex post-processing such as RoI cropping and NMS, which reduces the
inference efficiency of the video scene. To address the above problems, we
propose VEPE (Video End-to-End Pose Estimation), a simple and flexible
framework for end-to-end pose estimation in video. The framework utilizes three
crucial spatio-temporal Transformer components: the Spatio-Temporal Pose
Encoder (STPE), the Spatio-Temporal Deformable Memory Encoder (STDME), and the
Spatio-Temporal Pose Decoder (STPD). These components are designed to
effectively utilize temporal context for optimizing human body pose estimation.
Furthermore, to reduce the mismatch problem during the cross-frame pose query
matching process, we propose an instance consistency mechanism, which aims to
enhance the consistency and discrepancy of the cross-frame instance query and
realize the instance tracking function, which in turn accurately guides the
pose query to perform cross-frame matching. Extensive experiments on the
Posetrack dataset show that our approach outperforms most two-stage models and
improves inference efficiency by 300%.

Conclusion: PVINet通过并行处理和特征交互机制有效提升了点云压缩的重建质量。

Abstract: In point cloud compression, the quality of a reconstructed point cloud relies
on both the global structure and the local context, with existing methods
usually processing global and local information sequentially and lacking
communication between these two types of information. In this paper, we propose
a point-voxel interlaced network (PVINet), which captures global structural
features and local contextual features in parallel and performs interactions at
each scale to enhance feature perception efficiency. Specifically, PVINet
contains a voxel-based encoder (Ev) for extracting global structural features
and a point-based encoder (Ep) that models local contexts centered at each
voxel. Particularly, a novel conditional sparse convolution is introduced,
which applies point embeddings to dynamically customize kernels for voxel
feature extraction, facilitating feature interactions from Ep to Ev. During
decoding, a voxel-based decoder employs conditional sparse convolutions to
incorporate point embeddings as guidance to reconstruct the point cloud.
Experiments on benchmark datasets show that PVINet delivers competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出FICGen方法解决退化场景下布局到图像生成的上下文幻觉问题，通过频率知识迁移和上下文频率感知指导提升生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有布局到图像生成方法在退化场景（低光、水下）中生成保真度有限且与用户提供布局对齐性弱，主要归因于上下文幻觉困境

Method: 提出频率启发的上下文解耦生成范式：1）可学习双查询机制提取频率原型 2）视觉频率增强注意力注入频率知识 3）实例一致性图和自适应空间频率聚合模块

Result: 在5个基准测试中，FICGen在生成保真度、对齐性和下游辅助可训练性方面均优于现有方法

Conclusion: FICGen通过频率知识迁移和上下文解耦有效解决了退化场景下的布局到图像生成问题，为复杂环境下的视觉生成提供了新思路

Abstract: Layout-to-image (L2I) generation has exhibited promising results in natural
domains, but suffers from limited generative fidelity and weak alignment with
user-provided layouts when applied to degraded scenes (i.e., low-light,
underwater). We primarily attribute these limitations to the "contextual
illusion dilemma" in degraded conditions, where foreground instances are
overwhelmed by context-dominant frequency distributions. Motivated by this, our
paper proposes a new Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement Generative
(FICGen) paradigm, which seeks to transfer frequency knowledge of degraded
images into the latent diffusion space, thereby facilitating the rendering of
degraded instances and their surroundings via contextual frequency-aware
guidance. To be specific, FICGen consists of two major steps. Firstly, we
introduce a learnable dual-query mechanism, each paired with a dedicated
frequency resampler, to extract contextual frequency prototypes from
pre-collected degraded exemplars in the training set. Secondly, a
visual-frequency enhanced attention is employed to inject frequency prototypes
into the degraded generation process. To alleviate the contextual illusion and
attribute leakage, an instance coherence map is developed to regulate
latent-space disentanglement between individual instances and their
surroundings, coupled with an adaptive spatial-frequency aggregation module to
reconstruct spatial-frequency mixed degraded representations. Extensive
experiments on 5 benchmarks involving a variety of degraded scenarios-from
severe low-light to mild blur-demonstrate that FICGen consistently surpasses
existing L2I methods in terms of generative fidelity, alignment and downstream
auxiliary trainability.

TL;DR: GPSToken是一种新颖的高斯参数化空间自适应标记化框架，使用2D高斯模型动态建模图像区域的位置、形状和纹理，实现非均匀图像标记化，在图像重建和生成任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法受限于均匀的2D/1D网格标记化，无法灵活表示不同位置、形状和纹理变化的区域，限制了特征表示的有效性。

Method: 采用熵驱动算法将图像分割为纹理均匀的可变大小区域，每个区域用2D高斯（均值表示位置，协方差表示形状）和纹理特征参数化，通过专门训练的transformer优化高斯参数，使用可微分的splatting渲染器重建特征图。

Result: 在图像重建和生成任务上，使用128个token分别达到rFID 0.65和FID 1.50的state-of-the-art性能。

Conclusion: GPSToken通过解耦空间布局和纹理特征，实现了高效的两阶段生成，为图像表示和生成提供了灵活有效的标记化方案。

Abstract: Effective and efficient tokenization plays an important role in image
representation and generation. Conventional methods, constrained by uniform
2D/1D grid tokenization, are inflexible to represent regions with varying
shapes and textures and at different locations, limiting their efficacy of
feature representation. In this work, we propose $\textbf{GPSToken}$, a novel
$\textbf{G}$aussian $\textbf{P}$arameterized $\textbf{S}$patially-adaptive
$\textbf{Token}$ization framework, to achieve non-uniform image tokenization by
leveraging parametric 2D Gaussians to dynamically model the shape, position,
and textures of different image regions. We first employ an entropy-driven
algorithm to partition the image into texture-homogeneous regions of variable
sizes. Then, we parameterize each region as a 2D Gaussian (mean for position,
covariance for shape) coupled with texture features. A specialized transformer
is trained to optimize the Gaussian parameters, enabling continuous adaptation
of position/shape and content-aware feature extraction. During decoding,
Gaussian parameterized tokens are reconstructed into 2D feature maps through a
differentiable splatting-based renderer, bridging our adaptive tokenization
with standard decoders for end-to-end training. GPSToken disentangles spatial
layout (Gaussian parameters) from texture features to enable efficient
two-stage generation: structural layout synthesis using lightweight networks,
followed by structure-conditioned texture generation. Experiments demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of GPSToken, which achieves rFID and FID
scores of 0.65 and 1.50 on image reconstruction and generation tasks using 128
tokens, respectively. Codes and models of GPSToken can be found at

Motivation: 现有半监督学习方法主要关注生成参考预测的策略，但忽略了标注数据中的潜在噪声以及不同未标注像素的异质性价值。需要更有效地挖掘损失函数中两个预测所包含的丰富信息。

Method: 基于空间异质性损失，同时利用参考预测和监督预测的不确定性和一致性信息，将未标注数据的预测分为四个区域（UC、US、DC、DS），并采用自适应阈值区分置信预测和可疑预测。该损失也应用于标注图像以应对标注噪声。

Result: 实验结果表明，当与现有SSL框架集成时，该方法在不同数据集上显著提高了分割性能。

Conclusion: MetaSSL是一个即插即用的通用框架，能够有效提升半监督医学图像分割的效果，通过异质性损失函数更好地利用预测信息。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) is important for reducing the annotation cost
for medical image segmentation models. State-of-the-art SSL methods such as
Mean Teacher, FixMatch and Cross Pseudo Supervision (CPS) are mainly based on
consistency regularization or pseudo-label supervision between a reference
prediction and a supervised prediction. Despite the effectiveness, they have
overlooked the potential noise in the labeled data, and mainly focus on
strategies to generate the reference prediction, while ignoring the
heterogeneous values of different unlabeled pixels. We argue that effectively
mining the rich information contained by the two predictions in the loss
function, instead of the specific strategy to obtain a reference prediction, is
more essential for SSL, and propose a universal framework MetaSSL based on a
spatially heterogeneous loss that assigns different weights to pixels by
simultaneously leveraging the uncertainty and consistency information between
the reference and supervised predictions. Specifically, we split the
predictions on unlabeled data into four regions with decreasing weights in the
loss: Unanimous and Confident (UC), Unanimous and Suspicious (US), Discrepant
and Confident (DC), and Discrepant and Suspicious (DS), where an adaptive
threshold is proposed to distinguish confident predictions from suspicious
ones. The heterogeneous loss is also applied to labeled images for robust
learning considering the potential annotation noise. Our method is
plug-and-play and general to most existing SSL methods. The experimental
results showed that it improved the segmentation performance significantly when
integrated with existing SSL frameworks on different datasets. Code is
available at https://github.com/HiLab-git/MetaSSL.

Result: 在广泛实验中证明了各组件有效性，性能优于之前的最先进方法

Conclusion: 利用多时间戳轨迹信息能够显著提升多视角行人跟踪的关联鲁棒性和准确性

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Tracking (MVPT) aims to track pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view occupancy map from multi-view videos. End-to-end methods
that detect and associate pedestrians within one model have shown great
progress in MVPT. The motion and appearance information of pedestrians is
important for the association, but previous end-to-end MVPT methods rely only
on the current and its single adjacent past timestamp, discarding the past
trajectories before that. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end MVPT method
called Multi-View Trajectory Tracker (MVTrajecter) that utilizes information
from multiple timestamps in past trajectories for robust association.
MVTrajecter introduces trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to
effectively incorporate motion and appearance information, respectively. These
costs calculate which pedestrians at the current and each past timestamp are
likely identical based on the information between those timestamps. Even if a
current pedestrian could be associated with a false pedestrian at some past
timestamp, these costs enable the model to associate that current pedestrian
with the correct past trajectory based on other past timestamps. In addition,
MVTrajecter effectively captures the relationships between multiple timestamps
leveraging the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of each component in MVTrajecter and show that it outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型依赖视觉语言编码器进行关键帧采样，但这些编码器是否能真正识别最具信息量的帧尚不清楚，需要实证研究。

Method: 通过实证分析，提供了多个证据揭示流行视觉编码器在识别MLLM应该关注视频中哪些位置以处理给定文本查询方面的有限能力。

Result: 发现现有视觉编码器严重缺乏识别关键帧的能力，无法有效指导MLLM关注视频中的相关信息区域。

Conclusion: 需要开发更好的关键帧识别技术来支持高效视频多模态大语言模型的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to much
progress in video understanding tasks. To avoid the heavy computational cost of
processing all frames, these models typically rely on keyframe sampling methods
guided by vision-language encoders (\textit{e.g.,} SigLIP). However, it remains
unclear whether such encoders can truly identify the most informative frames.
In this work, we provide several empirical pieces of evidence revealing that
popular vision encoders critically suffer from their limited capability to
identify where the MLLM should look inside the video to handle the given
textual query appropriately. Our findings suggest that the development of
better keyframe identification techniques may be necessary for efficient video
MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有方法在从EEG信号重建动态视觉场景时面临空间分辨率低、时间不匹配和语义信息利用不足的问题，导致动态连贯性和复杂语义上下文解析不充分。

Method: 提出DynaMind框架，包含三个核心模块：区域感知语义映射器(RSM)提取多模态语义特征，时间感知动态对齐器(TDA)生成动态潜在序列保证时间一致性，双引导视频重建器(DGVR)将时序蓝图转换为高保真视频。

Conclusion: 这项工作在神经动力学和高保真视觉语义之间架起了关键桥梁，标志着脑解码领域的重要进展。

Abstract: Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG)
signals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low
spatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and
video dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain
activity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the
dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual
stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel
framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and
semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper
(RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video
Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to
extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain
regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the
TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal
consistency between the feature representations and the original neural
recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR
translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video
reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art
(SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by
12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in
pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence
with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical
advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual
semantics.

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized image generation aims to synthesize customized
images containing multiple specified subjects without requiring test-time
optimization. However, achieving fine-grained independent control over multiple
subjects remains challenging due to difficulties in preserving subject fidelity
and preventing cross-subject attribute leakage. We present FocusDPO, a
framework that adaptively identifies focus regions based on dynamic semantic
correspondence and supervision image complexity. During training, our method
progressively adjusts these focal areas across noise timesteps, implementing a
weighted strategy that rewards information-rich patches while penalizing
regions with low prediction confidence. The framework dynamically adjusts focus
allocation during the DPO process according to the semantic complexity of
reference images and establishes robust correspondence mappings between
generated and reference subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method substantially enhances the performance of existing pre-trained
personalized generation models, achieving state-of-the-art results on both
single-subject and multi-subject personalized image synthesis benchmarks. Our
method effectively mitigates attribute leakage while preserving superior
subject fidelity across diverse generation scenarios, advancing the frontier of
controllable multi-subject image synthesis.

Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的无监督分割质量评估方法存在评估粒度粗糙、评估不完整和迁移性差的问题，需要一种更全面、精细的像素级评估方法。

Conclusion: SegAssess通过PQM范式为无监督分割质量评估提供了强大且可迁移的解决方案，在遥感图像分析中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: High-quality image segmentation is fundamental to pixel-level geospatial
analysis in remote sensing, necessitating robust segmentation quality
assessment (SQA), particularly in unsupervised settings lacking ground truth.
Although recent deep learning (DL) based unsupervised SQA methods show
potential, they often suffer from coarse evaluation granularity, incomplete
assessments, and poor transferability. To overcome these limitations, this
paper introduces Panoramic Quality Mapping (PQM) as a new paradigm for
comprehensive, pixel-wise SQA, and presents SegAssess, a novel deep learning
framework realizing this approach. SegAssess distinctively formulates SQA as a
fine-grained, four-class panoramic segmentation task, classifying pixels within
a segmentation mask under evaluation into true positive (TP), false positive
(FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) categories, thereby
generating a complete quality map. Leveraging an enhanced Segment Anything
Model (SAM) architecture, SegAssess uniquely employs the input mask as a prompt
for effective feature integration via cross-attention. Key innovations include
an Edge Guided Compaction (EGC) branch with an Aggregated Semantic Filter (ASF)
module to refine predictions near challenging object edges, and an Augmented
Mixup Sampling (AMS) training strategy integrating multi-source masks to
significantly boost cross-domain robustness and zero-shot transferability.
Comprehensive experiments across 32 datasets derived from 6 sources demonstrate
that SegAssess achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits
remarkable zero-shot transferability to unseen masks, establishing PQM via
SegAssess as a robust and transferable solution for unsupervised SQA. The code

Motivation: 解决森林监测中缺乏高分辨率树高预测训练数据的关键缺口，使基于多时相观测的深度学习树高预测成为可能。

Method: 提出编码器-解码器框架，利用多时相多光谱影像和相对时间差异来预测树冠高度，采用U-Net架构进行训练。

Result: U-Net架构在PrediTree数据集上获得11.78%的掩码均方误差，比ResNet-50优12%，比仅用RGB波段优30%。

Conclusion: PrediTree数据集为森林监测提供了重要资源，深度学习模型能够有效预测树高变化，数据集和代码均已开源。

Abstract: We present PrediTree, the first comprehensive open-source dataset designed
for training and evaluating tree height prediction models at sub-meter
resolution. This dataset combines very high-resolution (0.5m) LiDAR-derived
canopy height maps, spatially aligned with multi-temporal and multi-spectral
imagery, across diverse forest ecosystems in France, totaling 3,141,568 images.
PrediTree addresses a critical gap in forest monitoring capabilities by
enabling the training of deep learning methods that can predict tree growth
based on multiple past observations. %\sout{Initially focused on French
forests, PrediTree is designed as an expanding resource with ongoing efforts to
incorporate data from other countries. } To make use of this PrediTree dataset,
we propose an encoder-decoder framework that requires the multi-temporal
multi-spectral imagery and the relative time differences in years between the
canopy height map timestamp (target) and each image acquisition date for which
this framework predicts the canopy height. The conducted experiments
demonstrate that a U-Net architecture trained on the PrediTree dataset provides
the highest masked mean squared error of $11.78\%$, outperforming the next-best
architecture, ResNet-50, by around $12\%$, and cutting the error of the same
experiments but on fewer bands (red, green, blue only), by around $30\%$. This
dataset is publicly available on \href{URL}{HuggingFace}, and both processing
and training codebases are available on \href{URL}{GitHub}.

Conclusion: DcMatch通过利用形状集合的整体结构和双重一致性约束，显著提升了非刚性多形状匹配的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Establishing point-to-point correspondences across multiple 3D shapes is a
fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics. In this paper, we
introduce DcMatch, a novel unsupervised learning framework for non-rigid
multi-shape matching. Unlike existing methods that learn a canonical embedding
from a single shape, our approach leverages a shape graph attention network to
capture the underlying manifold structure of the entire shape collection. This
enables the construction of a more expressive and robust shared latent space,
leading to more consistent shape-to-universe correspondences via a universe
predictor. Simultaneously, we represent these correspondences in both the
spatial and spectral domains and enforce their alignment in the shared universe
space through a novel cycle consistency loss. This dual-level consistency
fosters more accurate and coherent mappings. Extensive experiments on several
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
previous state-of-the-art approaches across diverse multi-shape matching
scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/YeTianwei/DcMatch.

Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation is a significant task for low-cost
and efficient three-dimensional scene perception in endoscopy. The variety of
illumination conditions and scene features is still the primary challenge for
generalizable depth estimation in endoscopic scenes. In this work, a
self-supervised framework is proposed for monocular depth estimation in various
endoscopy. Firstly, due to various features in endoscopic scenes with different
tissues, a novel block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts is proposed to
efficiently finetuning the foundation model for endoscopic depth estimation. In
the proposed module, based on the input feature, different experts with a small
amount of trainable parameters are adaptively selected for weighted inference,
from various mixture of low-rank experts which are allocated based on the
training quality of each block. Moreover, a novel self-supervised training
framework is proposed to jointly cope with the inconsistency of brightness and
reflectance. The proposed method outperform state-of-the-art works on both
realistic and simulated endoscopic datasets. Furthermore, the proposed network
also achieves the best generalization based on zero-shot depth estimation on
diverse endoscopic scenes. The proposed method could contribute to accurate
endoscopic perception for minimally invasive measurement and surgery. The code
will be released upon acceptance, while the demo video can be found on here:

Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) encodes visual relationships between objects in
images as graph structures. Thanks to the advances of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), the task of Open-Vocabulary SGG has been recently proposed where models
are evaluated on their functionality to learn a wide and diverse range of
relations. Current benchmarks in SGG, however, possess a very limited
vocabulary, making the evaluation of open-source models inefficient. In this
paper, we propose a new reference-free metric to fairly evaluate the
open-vocabulary capabilities of VLMs for relation prediction. Another
limitation of Open-Vocabulary SGG is the reliance on weakly supervised data of
poor quality for pre-training. We also propose a new solution for quickly
generating high-quality synthetic data through region-specific prompt tuning of
VLMs. Experimental results show that pre-training with this new data split can
benefit the generalization capabilities of Open-Voc SGG models.

Conclusion: 该工作为虚拟染色提供了稳健且可扩展的解决方案，推动了计算病理学领域的发展。

Abstract: Tumor spatial heterogeneity analysis requires precise correlation between
Hematoxylin and Eosin H&E morphology and immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker
expression, yet current methods suffer from spatial misalignment in consecutive
sections, severely compromising in situ pathological interpretation. In order
to obtain a more accurate virtual staining pattern, We propose PRINTER, a
weakly-supervised framework that integrates PRototype-drIven content and
staiNing patTERn decoupling and deformation-aware adversarial learning
strategies designed to accurately learn IHC staining patterns while preserving
H&E staining details. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) A
prototype-driven staining pattern transfer with explicit content-style
decoupling; and (2) A cyclic registration-synthesis framework GapBridge that
bridges H&E and IHC domains through deformable structural alignment, where
registered features guide cross-modal style transfer while synthesized outputs
iteratively refine the registration;(3) Deformation-Aware Adversarial Learning:
We propose a training framework where a generator and deformation-aware
registration network jointly adversarially optimize a style-focused
discriminator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRINTER effectively
achieves superior performance in preserving H&E staining details and virtual
staining fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides a
robust and scalable solution for virtual staining, advancing the field of
computational pathology.

Result: 训练的POINTS-Reader模型超越了许多同等或更大规模的现有公开和专有模型

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效构建高质量文档提取数据集和模型，适用于处理表格、公式、多栏文本等复杂格式，为文档转换领域提供了一种可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: High-quality labeled data is essential for training accurate document
conversion models, particularly in domains with complex formats such as tables,
formulas, and multi-column text. However, manual annotation is both costly and
time-consuming, while automatic labeling using existing models often lacks
accuracy in handling such challenging scenarios. Consequently, training student
models by distilling outputs from teacher models can significantly limit their
performance in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a fully
automated, distillation-free framework comprising two stages for constructing
high-quality document extraction datasets and models capable of handling
diverse document formats and layouts. In the first stage, we introduce a method
for generating large-scale, diverse synthetic data, which enables a model to
extract key elements in a unified format with strong initial performance. In
the second stage, we present a self-improvement approach that further adapts
the model, initially trained on synthetic data, to real-world documents.
Specifically, we first use the fine-tuned model to annotate real documents,
then apply a suite of filtering strategies to verify annotation quality, and
finally retrain the model on the verified dataset. By iteratively repeating
this process, we progressively enhance both the model's conversion capabilities
and the quality of the generated data. We train a public POINTS-1.5 model to
obtain POINTS-Reader, which surpasses many existing public and proprietary
models of comparable or larger size. Our model is available at

Abstract: Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) seeks to generate realistic human behaviors
within complex environments, yet it faces significant challenges in handling
long-horizon, high-level tasks and generalizing to unseen scenes. To address
these limitations, we introduce FantasyHSI, a novel HSI framework centered on
video generation and multi-agent systems that operates without paired data. We
model the complex interaction process as a dynamic directed graph, upon which
we build a collaborative multi-agent system. This system comprises a scene
navigator agent for environmental perception and high-level path planning, and
a planning agent that decomposes long-horizon goals into atomic actions.
Critically, we introduce a critic agent that establishes a closed-loop feedback
mechanism by evaluating the deviation between generated actions and the planned
path. This allows for the dynamic correction of trajectory drifts caused by the
stochasticity of the generative model, thereby ensuring long-term logical
consistency. To enhance the physical realism of the generated motions, we
leverage Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train the action generator,
significantly reducing artifacts such as limb distortion and foot-sliding.
Extensive experiments on our custom SceneBench benchmark demonstrate that
FantasyHSI significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
generalization, long-horizon task completion, and physical realism. Ours

researchers and practitioners with a clearer mental model of how RT-DETRv2
works under the hood.

Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation is a fundamental task in understanding human hands.
However, accurately estimating 3D hand poses remains challenging due to the
complex movement of hands, self-similarity, and frequent occlusions. In this
work, we address two limitations: the inability of existing 3D hand pose
estimation methods to estimate aleatoric (data) uncertainty, and the lack of
uncertainty modeling that incorporates joint correlation knowledge, which has
not been thoroughly investigated. To this end, we introduce aleatoric
uncertainty modeling into the 3D hand pose estimation framework, aiming to
achieve a better trade-off between modeling joint correlations and
computational efficiency. We propose a novel parameterization that leverages a
single linear layer to capture intrinsic correlations among hand joints. This
is enabled by formulating the hand joint output space as a probabilistic
distribution, allowing the linear layer to capture joint correlations. Our
proposed parameterization is used as a task head layer, and can be applied as
an add-on module on top of the existing models. Our experiments demonstrate
that our parameterization for uncertainty modeling outperforms existing
approaches. Furthermore, the 3D hand pose estimation model equipped with our
uncertainty head achieves favorable accuracy in 3D hand pose estimation while
introducing new uncertainty modeling capability to the model. The project page

Conclusion: 双视图交叉重建相比单视图自重建能显著提高预训练难度，在3D自监督学习方面超越了之前的单模态自重建方法

Abstract: Point cloud learning, especially in a self-supervised way without manual
labels, has gained growing attention in both vision and learning communities
due to its potential utility in a wide range of applications. Most existing
generative approaches for point cloud self-supervised learning focus on
recovering masked points from visible ones within a single view. Recognizing
that a two-view pre-training paradigm inherently introduces greater diversity
and variance, it may thus enable more challenging and informative pre-training.
Inspired by this, we explore the potential of two-view learning in this domain.
In this paper, we propose Point-PQAE, a cross-reconstruction generative
paradigm that first generates two decoupled point clouds/views and then
reconstructs one from the other. To achieve this goal, we develop a crop
mechanism for point cloud view generation for the first time and further
propose a novel positional encoding to represent the 3D relative position
between the two decoupled views. The cross-reconstruction significantly
increases the difficulty of pre-training compared to self-reconstruction, which
enables our method to surpass previous single-modal self-reconstruction methods
in 3D self-supervised learning. Specifically, it outperforms the
self-reconstruction baseline (Point-MAE) by 6.5%, 7.0%, and 6.7% in three
variants of ScanObjectNN with the Mlp-Linear evaluation protocol. The code is

Abstract: Image captioning systems often produce generic descriptions that fail to
capture event-level semantics which are crucial for applications like news
reporting and digital archiving. We present ReCap, a novel pipeline for
event-enriched image retrieval and captioning that incorporates broader
contextual information from relevant articles to generate narrative-rich,
factually grounded captions. Our approach addresses the limitations of standard
vision-language models that typically focus on visible content while missing
temporal, social, and historical contexts. ReCap comprises three integrated
components: (1) a robust two-stage article retrieval system using DINOv2
embeddings with global feature similarity for initial candidate selection
followed by patch-level mutual nearest neighbor similarity re-ranking; (2) a
context extraction framework that synthesizes information from article
summaries, generic captions, and original source metadata; and (3) a large
language model-based caption generation system with Semantic Gaussian
Normalization to enhance fluency and relevance. Evaluated on the OpenEvents V1
dataset as part of Track 1 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge, ReCap achieved a
strong overall score of 0.54666, ranking 2nd on the private test set. These
results highlight ReCap's effectiveness in bridging visual perception with

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) conducts pixel-level
classification via text-driven alignment, where the domain discrepancy between
base category training and open-vocabulary inference poses challenges in
discriminative modeling of latent unseen category. To address this challenge,
existing vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches demonstrate commendable
performance through pre-trained multi-modal representations. However, the
fundamental mechanisms of latent semantic comprehension remain underexplored,
making the bottleneck for OVSS. In this work, we initiate a probing experiment
to explore distribution patterns and dynamics of latent semantics in VLMs under
inductive learning paradigms. Building on these insights, we propose X-Agent,
an innovative OVSS framework employing latent semantic-aware ``agent'' to
orchestrate cross-modal attention mechanisms, simultaneously optimizing latent
semantic dynamic and amplifying its perceptibility. Extensive benchmark
evaluations demonstrate that X-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance
while effectively enhancing the latent semantic saliency.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object detection faces significant challenges
from speckle noise, small target ambiguities, and on-board computational
constraints. While existing approaches predominantly focus on SAR-specific
architectural modifications, this paper explores the application of the
existing lightweight object detector, i.e., YOLOv10, for SAR object detection
and enhances its performance through Neural Architecture Search (NAS).
Specifically, we employ NAS to systematically optimize the network structure,
especially focusing on the backbone architecture search. By constructing an
extensive search space and leveraging evolutionary search, our method
identifies a favorable architecture that balances accuracy, parameter
efficiency, and computational cost. Notably, this work introduces NAS to SAR
object detection for the first time. The experimental results on the
large-scale SARDet-100K dataset demonstrate that our optimized model
outperforms existing SAR detection methods, achieving superior detection
accuracy while maintaining lower computational overhead. We hope this work
offers a novel perspective on leveraging NAS for real-world applications.

Abstract: Detecting objects efficiently from radar sensors has recently become a
popular trend due to their robustness against adverse lighting and weather
conditions compared with cameras. This paper presents an efficient object
detection model for Range-Doppler (RD) radar maps. Specifically, we first
represent RD radar maps with multi-representation, i.e., heatmaps and grayscale
images, to gather high-level object and fine-grained texture features. Then, we
design an additional Adapter branch, an Exchanger Module with two modes, and a
Primary-Auxiliary Fusion Module to effectively extract, exchange, and fuse
features from the multi-representation inputs, respectively. Furthermore, we
construct a supernet with various width and fusion operations in the Adapter
branch for the proposed model and employ a One-Shot Neural Architecture Search
method to further improve the model's efficiency while maintaining high
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our model obtains favorable
accuracy and efficiency trade-off. Moreover, we achieve new state-of-the-art
performance on RADDet and CARRADA datasets with mAP@50 of 71.9 and 57.1,
respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于常微分方程和傅里叶变换的一体化模块FSS-TIs，用于解决跨域少样本分割问题，通过ODE关系在时间区间上迭代变换频谱特征，实现了优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨域少样本分割方法通常设计多个独立模块来增强特征表示的跨域泛化能力，但这些模块之间的独立性阻碍了知识的有效流动，难以充分发挥它们的集体潜力。

Method: 提出FSS-TIs方法，假设域特定特征和域无关特征的频谱之间存在ODE关系，通过时间区间上的迭代变换过程，结合随机扰动的仿射变换，将域无关特征表示空间的探索和多样化目标域分布的模拟重新表述为ODE内在参数的优化过程。

Result: 在五个不同领域的数据集上定义了两种跨域少样本分割任务，实验结果表明FSS-TIs优于现有的CD-FSS方法，深入的消融研究进一步验证了其跨域适应性。

Conclusion: FSS-TIs通过ODE和傅里叶变换的一体化设计，有效解决了跨域少样本分割中的知识流动问题，在多个跨域任务上表现出优越的性能和良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) not only enables the segmentation
of unseen categories with very limited samples, but also improves cross-domain
generalization ability within the few-shot segmentation framework. Currently,
existing CD-FSS studies typically design multiple independent modules to
enhance the cross-domain generalization ability of feature representations.
However, the independence among these modules hinders the effective flow of
knowledge, making it difficult to fully leverage their collective potential. In
contrast, this paper proposes an all-in-one module based on ordinary
differential equations and Fourier transform, resulting in a structurally
concise method--Few-Shot Segmentation over Time Intervals (FSS-TIs). FSS-TIs
assumes the existence of an ODE relationship between the spectra (including
amplitude and phase spectra) of domain-specific features and domain-agnostic
features. This ODE formulation yields an iterative transformation process along
a sequence of time intervals, while simultaneously applying affine
transformations with randomized perturbations to the spectra. In doing so, the
exploration of domain-agnostic feature representation spaces and the simulation
of diverse potential target-domain distributions are reformulated as an
optimization process over the intrinsic parameters of the ODE. Moreover, we
strictly constrain the support-sample selection during target-domain
fine-tuning so that it is consistent with the requirements of real-world
few-shot segmentation tasks. For evaluation, we introduce five datasets from
substantially different domains and define two sets of cross-domain few-shot
segmentation tasks to comprehensively analyze the performance of FSS-TIs.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of FSS-TIs over existing
CD-FSS methods, and in-depth ablation studies further validate the cross-domain
adaptability of FSS-TIs.

TL;DR: 提出了首个端到端框架，联合处理LiDAR超分辨率和语义分割，通过轻量级架构实现与高成本64通道LiDAR相当的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率LiDAR成本昂贵限制了大规模部署，而低成本16通道LiDAR产生的稀疏点云会降低分割精度

Method: 采用联合优化训练框架，SR模块融入语义线索并保留细节，新SR损失函数聚焦感兴趣区域，轻量级模型架构参数更少

Result: 实验表明该方法在分割性能上可与高分辨率64通道LiDAR数据相媲美

Conclusion: 提出的联合优化框架有效解决了低成本LiDAR的分割精度问题，为自动驾驶大规模部署提供了可行方案

Abstract: High-resolution LiDAR data plays a critical role in 3D semantic segmentation
for autonomous driving, but the high cost of advanced sensors limits
large-scale deployment. In contrast, low-cost sensors such as 16-channel LiDAR
produce sparse point clouds that degrade segmentation accuracy. To overcome
this, we introduce the first end-to-end framework that jointly addresses LiDAR
super-resolution (SR) and semantic segmentation. The framework employs joint
optimization during training, allowing the SR module to incorporate semantic
cues and preserve fine details, particularly for smaller object classes. A new
SR loss function further directs the network to focus on regions of interest.
The proposed lightweight, model-based SR architecture uses significantly fewer
parameters than existing LiDAR SR approaches, while remaining easily compatible
with segmentation networks. Experiments show that our method achieves
segmentation performance comparable to models operating on high-resolution and
costly 64-channel LiDAR data.

TL;DR: PGRD是一个基于扩散模型的医学图像分割框架，通过先验引导和残差学习来捕获体素级分布，在保持良好校准的同时提高采样效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割存在模糊性，需要模型能够捕获完整的条件分布而非单点估计，传统方法在分布建模和校准方面存在不足。

Method: 将离散标签嵌入连续空间对齐分割与扩散建模；使用粗糙先验预测器提供步进指导；扩散网络学习先验残差加速收敛；采用深度扩散监督方案稳定训练。

Result: 在MRI和CT数据集上，PGRD相比贝叶斯、集成、Probabilistic U-Net和原始扩散基线，获得了更高的Dice分数和更低的NLL/ECE值，且需要更少采样步骤达到强性能。

Conclusion: PGRD框架有效解决了医学图像分割中的模糊性问题，在保持校准性能的同时显著提高了采样效率，为概率性分割提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Ambiguity in medical image segmentation calls for models that capture full
conditional distributions rather than a single point estimate. We present
Prior-Guided Residual Diffusion (PGRD), a diffusion-based framework that learns
voxel-wise distributions while maintaining strong calibration and practical
sampling efficiency. PGRD embeds discrete labels as one-hot targets in a
continuous space to align segmentation with diffusion modeling. A coarse prior
predictor provides step-wise guidance; the diffusion network then learns the
residual to the prior, accelerating convergence and improving calibration. A
deep diffusion supervision scheme further stabilizes training by supervising
intermediate time steps. Evaluated on representative MRI and CT datasets, PGRD
achieves higher Dice scores and lower NLL/ECE values than Bayesian, ensemble,
Probabilistic U-Net, and vanilla diffusion baselines, while requiring fewer
sampling steps to reach strong performance.

Motivation: 随着社交媒体数据和手机摄像头的普及，传统计算机视觉技术在图像地理定位方面遇到挑战，需要更有效的解决方案来支撑导航、位置推荐等关键应用。

Method: 使用SigLIP编码器在EMP-16和OSV-5M两个大规模数据集上构建向量数据库，通过检索增强生成技术为查询图像添加包含相似和不相似地理位置信息的提示，然后用多模态大语言模型处理。

Result: 在IM2GPS、IM2GPS3k和YFCC4k三个标准数据集上达到了最先进的性能，实现了更高的准确度，且无需细调或重新训练。

Conclusion: 检索增强生成多模态大语言模型在地理定位中显示出高效性，为传统从头训练模型的方法提供了替代选择，开启了更易访问和可扩展的GeoAI解决方案的新可能性。

Abstract: Street-level geolocalization from images is crucial for a wide range of
essential applications and services, such as navigation, location-based
recommendations, and urban planning. With the growing popularity of social
media data and cameras embedded in smartphones, applying traditional computer
vision techniques to localize images has become increasingly challenging, yet
highly valuable. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates
open-weight and publicly accessible multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. The method constructs a vector database using
the SigLIP encoder on two large-scale datasets (EMP-16 and OSV-5M). Query
images are augmented with prompts containing both similar and dissimilar
geolocation information retrieved from this database before being processed by
the multimodal large language models. Our approach has demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance, achieving higher accuracy compared against three
widely used benchmark datasets (IM2GPS, IM2GPS3k, and YFCC4k). Importantly, our
solution eliminates the need for expensive fine-tuning or retraining and scales
seamlessly to incorporate new data sources. The effectiveness of
retrieval-augmented generation-based multimodal large language models in
geolocation estimation demonstrated by this paper suggests an alternative path
to the traditional methods which rely on the training models from scratch,
opening new possibilities for more accessible and scalable solutions in GeoAI.

Abstract: Meeting the increasing global demand for food security and sustainable
farming requires intelligent crop recommendation systems that operate in real
time. Traditional soil analysis techniques are often slow, labor-intensive, and
not suitable for on-field decision-making. To address these limitations, we
introduce AgroSense, a deep-learning framework that integrates soil image
classification and nutrient profiling to produce accurate and contextually
relevant crop recommendations. AgroSense comprises two main components: a Soil
Classification Module, which leverages ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0, and Vision
Transformer architectures to categorize soil types from images; and a Crop
Recommendation Module, which employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron, XGBoost,
LightGBM, and TabNet to analyze structured soil data, including nutrient
levels, pH, and rainfall. We curated a multimodal dataset of 10,000 paired
samples drawn from publicly available Kaggle repositories, approximately 50,000
soil images across seven classes, and 25,000 nutrient profiles for experimental
evaluation. The fused model achieves 98.0% accuracy, with a precision of 97.8%,
a recall of 97.7%, and an F1-score of 96.75%, while RMSE and MAE drop to 0.32
and 0.27, respectively. Ablation studies underscore the critical role of
multimodal coupling, and statistical validation via t-tests and ANOVA confirms
the significance of our improvements. AgroSense offers a practical, scalable
solution for real-time decision support in precision agriculture and paves the
way for future lightweight multimodal AI systems in resource-constrained
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了M3Ret，一种统一的视觉编码器，能够在不使用模态特定自定义的情况下学习转移性表征，从而解决了医学形态特定设计导致的可扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学图像检索方法存在分散问题，不同模态（2D、3D、视频）需要不同的架构和训练策略，这种模态特定设计影响了可扩展性和统一表征的发展。

Method: 构建了大规模混合模态数据集（867,653个医学形态样本），训练M3Ret统一视觉编码器，采用生成式MAE和对比式SimDINO自监督学习方法。

Result: 在所有单个模态上达到了新的零样本图像到图像检索最佳性能，超越了DINOv3和BMC-CLIP等基线方法。模型还显示出强大的跨模态对齐能力，并能够泛化到未见的MRI任务。

Conclusion: M3Ret作为一种基础模型，为多模态医学图像理解中的纯视觉自监督学习提供了有前景的方向，显示了其在未见模态上的良好泛化能力。

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is essential for clinical decision-making and
translational research, relying on discriminative visual representations. Yet,
current methods remain fragmented, relying on separate architectures and
training strategies for 2D, 3D, and video-based medical data. This
modality-specific design hampers scalability and inhibits the development of
unified representations. To enable unified learning, we curate a large-scale
hybrid-modality dataset comprising 867,653 medical imaging samples, including
2D X-rays and ultrasounds, RGB endoscopy videos, and 3D CT scans. Leveraging
this dataset, we train M3Ret, a unified visual encoder without any
modality-specific customization. It successfully learns transferable
representations using both generative (MAE) and contrastive (SimDINO)
self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms. Our approach sets a new
state-of-the-art in zero-shot image-to-image retrieval across all individual
modalities, surpassing strong baselines such as DINOv3 and the text-supervised
BMC-CLIP. More remarkably, strong cross-modal alignment emerges without paired
data, and the model generalizes to unseen MRI tasks, despite never observing
MRI during pretraining, demonstrating the generalizability of purely visual
self-supervision to unseen modalities. Comprehensive analyses further validate
the scalability of our framework across model and data sizes. These findings
deliver a promising signal to the medical imaging community, positioning M3Ret
as a step toward foundation models for visual SSL in multimodal medical image
understanding.

Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation creates videos faithful
to both a reference subject image and a text prompt. While fine-tuning large
pretrained video diffusion models on ID-matched data achieves state-of-the-art
results on IPT2V, data scarcity and high tuning costs hinder broader
improvement. We thus introduce a Training-Free Prompt, Image, and Guidance
Enhancement (TPIGE) framework that bridges the semantic gap between the video
description and the reference image and design sampling guidance that enhances
identity preservation and video quality, achieving performance gains at minimal
cost.Specifically, we first propose Face Aware Prompt Enhancement, using GPT-4o
to enhance the text prompt with facial details derived from the reference
image. We then propose Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement, leveraging an
identity-preserving image generator to refine the reference image, rectifying
conflicts with the text prompt. The above mutual refinement significantly
improves input quality before video generation. Finally, we propose ID-Aware
Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement, utilizing unified gradients to optimize
identity preservation and video quality jointly during generation.Our method
outperforms prior work and is validated by automatic and human evaluations on a
1000 video test set, winning first place in the ACM Multimedia 2025
Identity-Preserving Video Generation Challenge, demonstrating state-of-the-art
performance and strong generality. The code is available at

Abstract: Real-time video analytics on high-resolution cameras has become a popular
technology for various intelligent services like traffic control and crowd
monitoring. While extensive work has been done on improving analytics accuracy
with timing guarantees, virtually all of them target static viewpoint cameras.
In this paper, we present Uirapuru, a novel framework for real-time, edge-based
video analytics on high-resolution steerable cameras. The actuation performed
by those cameras brings significant dynamism to the scene, presenting a
critical challenge to existing popular approaches such as frame tiling. To
address this problem, Uirapuru incorporates a comprehensive understanding of
camera actuation into the system design paired with fast adaptive tiling at a
per-frame level. We evaluate Uirapuru on a high-resolution video dataset,
augmented by pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) movements typical for steerable cameras and on
real-world videos collected from an actual PTZ camera. Our experimental results
show that Uirapuru provides up to 1.45x improvement in accuracy while
respecting specified latency budgets or reaches up to 4.53x inference speedup
with on-par accuracy compared to state-of-the-art static camera approaches.

Abstract: Low light conditions significantly degrade Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
performance in critical applications. Existing Low-light Image Enhancement
(LIE) methods struggle with the unique challenges of aerial imagery, including
Ultra-High Resolution (UHR), lack of paired data, severe non-uniform
illumination, and deployment constraints. To address these issues, we propose
three key contributions. First, we present U3D, the first unsupervised UHR UAV
dataset for LIE, with a unified evaluation toolkit. Second, we introduce the
Edge Efficiency Index (EEI), a novel metric balancing perceptual quality with
key deployment factors: speed, resolution, model complexity, and memory
footprint. Third, we develop U3LIE, an efficient framework with two
training-only designs-Adaptive Pre-enhancement Augmentation (APA) for input
normalization and a Luminance Interval Loss (L_int) for exposure control. U3LIE
achieves SOTA results, processing 4K images at 23.8 FPS on a single GPU, making
it ideal for real-time on-board deployment. In summary, these contributions
provide a holistic solution (dataset, metric, and method) for advancing robust
24/7 UAV vision. The code and datasets are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAL框架通过概率建模和置信门控机制，解决了部分相关视频检索中的查询歧义和视频片段噪声问题，显著提升了检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分相关视频检索(PRVR)面临的核心挑战是数据不确定性带来的伪语义关联，包括查询歧义性（查询不完整包含无用标记）和部分视频相关性（查询无关片段引入噪声）。现有方法容易受到具有伪相似性的干扰视频影响。

Method: 提出鲁棒对齐学习(RAL)框架：1）通过多元高斯分布对视频和查询进行概率建模，量化数据不确定性并实现代理级匹配；2）引入可学习的置信门控动态加权相似度，考虑查询词的不同信息量。

Result: RAL作为即插即用解决方案，可以无缝集成到现有架构中。在多样化检索骨干网络上的大量实验证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过显式建模数据不确定性，有效解决了PRVR中的跨模态对齐问题，为处理视频检索中的不确定性提供了新的概率建模方法。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve untrimmed videos
partially relevant to a given query. The core challenge lies in learning robust
query-video alignment against spurious semantic correlations arising from
inherent data uncertainty: 1) query ambiguity, where the query incompletely
characterizes the target video and often contains uninformative tokens, and 2)
partial video relevance, where abundant query-irrelevant segments introduce
contextual noise in cross-modal alignment. Existing methods often focus on
enhancing multi-scale clip representations and retrieving the most relevant
clip. However, the inherent data uncertainty in PRVR renders them vulnerable to
distractor videos with spurious similarities, leading to suboptimal
performance. To fill this research gap, we propose Robust Alignment Learning
(RAL) framework, which explicitly models the uncertainty in data. Key
innovations include: 1) we pioneer probabilistic modeling for PRVR by encoding
videos and queries as multivariate Gaussian distributions. This not only
quantifies data uncertainty but also enables proxy-level matching to capture
the variability in cross-modal correspondences; 2) we consider the
heterogeneous informativeness of query words and introduce learnable confidence
gates to dynamically weight similarity. As a plug-and-play solution, RAL can be
seamlessly integrated into the existing architectures. Extensive experiments
across diverse retrieval backbones demonstrate its effectiveness.

Motivation: 体素网格在医学成像中存在分辨率限制、拓扑信息丢失和稀疏数据处理效率低的问题，而基于坐标的隐式表示能更好地处理稀疏数据并保留复杂几何信息。

Method: 使用神经占用场预测3D点是否在物体内部来表示CT扫描的胸腔，并应用拉普拉斯收缩来提取胸腔的中轴。

Result: 在RibSeg数据集的20个医学扫描上进行了评估，证明了连续坐标基3D场景表示相比体素基表示的优越性。

Conclusion: 隐式占用场为医学成像中的几何操作提供了更有效的解决方案，特别是在处理稀疏数据和复杂几何结构时表现出色。

Abstract: We present RibPull, a methodology that utilizes implicit occupancy fields to
bridge computational geometry and medical imaging. Implicit 3D representations
use continuous functions that handle sparse and noisy data more effectively
than discrete methods. While voxel grids are standard for medical imaging, they
suffer from resolution limitations, topological information loss, and
inefficient handling of sparsity. Coordinate functions preserve complex
geometrical information and represent a better solution for sparse data
representation, while allowing for further morphological operations. Implicit
scene representations enable neural networks to encode entire 3D scenes within
their weights. The result is a continuous function that can implicitly
compesate for sparse signals and infer further information about the 3D scene
by passing any combination of 3D coordinates as input to the model. In this
work, we use neural occupancy fields that predict whether a 3D point lies
inside or outside an object to represent CT-scanned ribcages. We also apply a
Laplacian-based contraction to extract the medial axis of the ribcage, thus
demonstrating a geometrical operation that benefits greatly from continuous
coordinate-based 3D scene representations versus voxel-based representations.
We evaluate our methodology on 20 medical scans from the RibSeg dataset, which
is itself an extension of the RibFrac dataset. We will release our code upon
publication.

TL;DR: NSD是一个新颖的图像编辑框架，通过并行交叉注意力机制和渐进式自风格表示学习模块，实现了语义控制与风格一致性的双重目标，并在新建立的基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法主要关注语义控制，往往忽视了保持风格一致性的重要性，而风格一致性对于图像的连贯性和美学吸引力至关重要。

Method: 提出Neural Scene Designer (NSD)框架，采用并行交叉注意力机制分别处理文本和风格信息，并设计渐进式自风格表示学习(PSRL)模块，通过风格对比损失学习细粒度风格表示。

Result: 在建立的综合基准测试上进行大量实验，证明了所提框架的有效性，能够实现照片级真实的场景区域操作，同时确保语义对齐和风格一致性。

Conclusion: NSD框架成功解决了图像编辑中的风格一致性问题，通过创新的并行处理机制和风格学习模块，为图像编辑任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Maintaining stylistic consistency is crucial for the cohesion and aesthetic
appeal of images, a fundamental requirement in effective image editing and
inpainting. However, existing methods primarily focus on the semantic control
of generated content, often neglecting the critical task of preserving this
consistency. In this work, we introduce the Neural Scene Designer (NSD), a
novel framework that enables photo-realistic manipulation of user-specified
scene regions while ensuring both semantic alignment with user intent and
stylistic consistency with the surrounding environment. NSD leverages an
advanced diffusion model, incorporating two parallel cross-attention mechanisms
that separately process text and style information to achieve the dual
objectives of semantic control and style consistency. To capture fine-grained
style representations, we propose the Progressive Self-style Representational
Learning (PSRL) module. This module is predicated on the intuitive premise that
different regions within a single image share a consistent style, whereas
regions from different images exhibit distinct styles. The PSRL module employs
a style contrastive loss that encourages high similarity between
representations from the same image while enforcing dissimilarity between those
from different images. Furthermore, to address the lack of standardized
evaluation protocols for this task, we establish a comprehensive benchmark.
This benchmark includes competing algorithms, dedicated style-related metrics,
and diverse datasets and settings to facilitate fair comparisons. Extensive
experiments conducted on our benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

TL;DR: MILO是一个轻量级的多尺度感知度量方法，用于全参考图像质量评估，通过伪MOS监督训练，在图像和潜在空间中作为感知损失函数表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统图像质量评估方法需要大规模人工标注数据的问题，以及现有度量方法在计算效率和感知对齐方面的不足。

Method: 使用可重现的失真图像和多个质量度量的集成评分进行伪MOS监督训练，结合空间掩蔽和课程学习策略，在VAE编码器的潜在表示中进行感知优化。

Result: MILO在标准FR-IQA基准测试中超越现有度量方法，推理速度快，在去噪、超分辨率和人脸修复等任务中显著提升性能并降低计算开销。

Conclusion: MILO既是先进的图像质量度量工具，也是生成管道中实用的感知优化工具，在图像和潜在空间优化方面都具有重要价值。

Abstract: We present MILO (Metric for Image- and Latent-space Optimization), a
lightweight, multiscale, perceptual metric for full-reference image quality
assessment (FR-IQA). MILO is trained using pseudo-MOS (Mean Opinion Score)
supervision, in which reproducible distortions are applied to diverse images
and scored via an ensemble of recent quality metrics that account for visual
masking effects. This approach enables accurate learning without requiring
large-scale human-labeled datasets. Despite its compact architecture, MILO
outperforms existing metrics across standard FR-IQA benchmarks and offers fast
inference suitable for real-time applications. Beyond quality prediction, we
demonstrate the utility of MILO as a perceptual loss in both image and latent
domains. In particular, we show that spatial masking modeled by MILO, when
applied to latent representations from a VAE encoder within Stable Diffusion,
enables efficient and perceptually aligned optimization. By combining spatial
masking with a curriculum learning strategy, we first process perceptually less
relevant regions before progressively shifting the optimization to more
visually distorted areas. This strategy leads to significantly improved
performance in tasks like denoising, super-resolution, and face restoration,
while also reducing computational overhead. MILO thus functions as both a
state-of-the-art image quality metric and as a practical tool for perceptual
optimization in generative pipelines.

Abstract: As obesity rates continue to increase, automated calorie tracking has become
a vital tool for people seeking to maintain a healthy lifestyle or adhere to a
diet plan. Although numerous research efforts have addressed this issue,
existing approaches often face key limitations, such as providing only constant
caloric output, struggling with multiple food recognition challenges,
challenges in image scaling and normalization, and a predominant focus on
Western cuisines. In this paper, we propose a tailored solution that
specifically targets Bangladeshi street food. We first construct a diverse
dataset of popular street foods found across Bangladesh. Then, we develop a
refined calorie estimation system by modifying the state-of-the-art vision
model YOLOv8. Our modified model achieves superior classification and
segmentation results, with only a slight increase in computational complexity
compared to the base variant. Coupled with a machine learning regression model,
our system achieves an impressive 6.94 mean absolute error (MAE), 11.03 root
mean squared error (RMSE), and a 96.0% R^2 score in calorie estimation, making
it both highly effective and accurate for real-world food calorie calculations.

Conclusion: InfoScale通过信息中心化的方法有效解决了扩散模型在可变尺度图像生成中的关键问题，实现了更好的跨分辨率生成性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have become dominant in visual generation but suffer
performance drop when tested on resolutions that differ from the training
scale, whether lower or higher. In fact, the key challenge in generating
variable-scale images lies in the differing amounts of information across
resolutions, which requires information conversion procedures to be varied for
generating variable-scaled images. In this paper, we investigate the issues of
three critical aspects in DMs for a unified analysis in variable-scaled
generation: dilated convolution, attention mechanisms, and initial noise.
Specifically, 1) dilated convolution in DMs for the higher-resolution
generation loses high-frequency information. 2) Attention for variable-scaled
image generation struggles to adjust the information aggregation adaptively. 3)
The spatial distribution of information in the initial noise is misaligned with
variable-scaled image. To solve the above problems, we propose
\textbf{InfoScale}, an information-centric framework for variable-scaled image
generation by effectively utilizing information from three aspects
correspondingly. For information loss in 1), we introduce Progressive Frequency
Compensation module to compensate for high-frequency information lost by
dilated convolution in higher-resolution generation. For information
aggregation inflexibility in 2), we introduce Adaptive Information Aggregation
module to adaptively aggregate information in lower-resolution generation and
achieve an effective balance between local and global information in
higher-resolution generation. For information distribution misalignment in 3),
we design Noise Adaptation module to re-distribute information in initial noise
for variable-scaled generation. Our method is plug-and-play for DMs and
extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness in variable-scaled image
generation.

Abstract: The computational assessment of facial attractiveness, a challenging
subjective regression task, is dominated by architectures with a critical
trade-off: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer efficiency but have
limited receptive fields, while Vision Transformers (ViTs) model global context
at a quadratic computational cost. To address this, we propose Mamba-CNN, a
novel and efficient hybrid architecture. Mamba-CNN integrates a lightweight,
Mamba-inspired State Space Model (SSM) gating mechanism into a hierarchical
convolutional backbone. This core innovation allows the network to dynamically
modulate feature maps and selectively emphasize salient facial features and
their long-range spatial relationships, mirroring human holistic perception
while maintaining computational efficiency. We conducted extensive experiments
on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, where our model sets a new
state-of-the-art. Mamba-CNN achieves a Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9187, a
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.2022, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of
0.2610. Our findings validate the synergistic potential of combining CNNs with
selective SSMs and present a powerful new architectural paradigm for nuanced
visual understanding tasks.

Abstract: Video summarization aims to extract key shots from longer videos to produce
concise and informative summaries. One of its most common applications is in
sports, where highlight reels capture the most important moments of a game,
along with notable reactions and specific contextual events. Automatic summary
generation can support video editors in the sports media industry by reducing
the time and effort required to identify key segments. However, the lack of
publicly available datasets poses a challenge in developing robust models for
sports highlight generation. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing
a curated dataset for soccer video summarization, designed to serve as a
benchmark for the task. The dataset includes shot boundaries for 237 matches
from the Spanish, French, and Italian leagues, using broadcast footage sourced
from the SoccerNet dataset. Alongside the dataset, we propose a baseline model
specifically designed for this task, which achieves an F1 score of 0.3956 in
the test set. Furthermore, we propose a new metric constrained by the length of
each target summary, enabling a more objective evaluation of the generated
content. The dataset and code are available at

Abstract: Images vary in how memorable they are to humans. Inspired by findings from
cognitive science and computer vision, this paper explores the correlates of
image memorability in pretrained vision encoders, focusing on latent
activations, attention distributions, and the uniformity of image patches. We
find that these features correlate with memorability to some extent.
Additionally, we explore sparse autoencoder loss over the representations of
vision transformers as a proxy for memorability, which yields results
outperforming past methods using convolutional neural network representations.
Our results shed light on the relationship between model-internal features and
memorability. They show that some features are informative predictors of what
makes images memorable to humans.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for 3D hair reconstruction from single
photographs based on a global hair prior combined with local optimization.
Capturing strand-based hair geometry from single photographs is challenging due
to the variety and geometric complexity of hairstyles and the lack of ground
truth training data. Classical reconstruction methods like multi-view stereo
only reconstruct the visible hair strands, missing the inner structure of
hairstyles and hampering realistic hair simulation. To address this, existing
methods leverage hairstyle priors trained on synthetic data. Such data,
however, is limited in both quantity and quality since it requires manual work
from skilled artists to model the 3D hairstyles and create near-photorealistic
renderings. To address this, we propose a novel approach that uses both, real
and synthetic data to learn an effective hairstyle prior. Specifically, we
train a transformer-based prior model on synthetic data to obtain knowledge of
the internal hairstyle geometry and introduce real data in the learning process
to model the outer structure. This training scheme is able to model the visible
hair strands depicted in an input image, while preserving the general 3D
structure of hairstyles. We exploit this prior to create a
Gaussian-splatting-based reconstruction method that creates hairstyles from one
or more images. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing
reconstruction pipelines demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance
of our method for capturing detailed hair orientation, overall silhouette, and
backside consistency. For additional results and code, please refer to

Motivation: 解决当前体素方法精度高但推理慢、柱状方法速度快但精度不足的问题，寻求在自动驾驶3D目标检测中实现精度与速度的平衡。

Method: 提出PointSlice方法：1) 将3D点云沿水平面切片成多个2D数据集，模型仅学习2D数据分布；2) 引入切片交互网络(SIN)在2D骨干网络中保持切片间的垂直关系。

Conclusion: PointSlice在多个数据集上实现了高检测精度和快速推理的平衡，为3D点云目标检测提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D object detection from point clouds plays a critical role in autonomous
driving. Currently, the primary methods for point cloud processing are
voxel-based and pillarbased approaches. Voxel-based methods offer high accuracy
through fine-grained spatial segmentation but suffer from slower inference
speeds. Pillar-based methods enhance inference speed but still fall short of
voxel-based methods in accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel
point cloud processing method, PointSlice, which slices point clouds along the
horizontal plane and includes a dedicated detection network. The main
contributions of PointSlice are: (1) A new point cloud processing technique
that converts 3D point clouds into multiple sets of 2D (x-y) data slices. The
model only learns 2D data distributions, treating the 3D point cloud as
separate batches of 2D data, which reduces the number of model parameters and
enhances inference speed; (2) The introduction of a Slice Interaction Network
(SIN). To maintain vertical relationships across slices, we incorporate SIN
into the 2D backbone network, which improves the model's 3D object perception
capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointSlice achieves high
detection accuracy and inference speed. On the Waymo dataset, PointSlice is
1.13x faster and has 0.79x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art
voxel-based method (SAFDNet), with only a 1.2 mAPH accuracy reduction. On the
nuScenes dataset, we achieve a state-of-the-art detection result of 66.74 mAP.
On the Argoverse 2 dataset, PointSlice is 1.10x faster, with 0.66x fewer
parameters and a 1.0 mAP accuracy reduction. The code will be available at

Abstract: Fast and accurate 3D shape generation from point clouds is essential for
applications in robotics, AR/VR, and digital content creation. We introduce
ConTiCoM-3D, a continuous-time consistency model that synthesizes 3D shapes
directly in point space, without discretized diffusion steps, pre-trained
teacher models, or latent-space encodings. The method integrates a
TrigFlow-inspired continuous noise schedule with a Chamfer Distance-based
geometric loss, enabling stable training on high-dimensional point sets while
avoiding expensive Jacobian-vector products. This design supports efficient
one- to two-step inference with high geometric fidelity. In contrast to
previous approaches that rely on iterative denoising or latent decoders,
ConTiCoM-3D employs a time-conditioned neural network operating entirely in
continuous time, thereby achieving fast generation. Experiments on the ShapeNet
benchmark show that ConTiCoM-3D matches or outperforms state-of-the-art
diffusion and latent consistency models in both quality and efficiency,
establishing it as a practical framework for scalable 3D shape generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: nnUNet框架虽然能自动调整训练脚本中的大部分超参数，但忽略了分割网络内部超参数的调优，这限制了模型的泛化能力。需要一种能够根据不同数据集特征自适应调整的方法。

Method: 提出了自适应卷积模块，动态调整卷积核大小。该模块集成到MSA2-Net的两个关键组件中：多尺度卷积桥和多尺度融合解码器，分别用于优化CSWin Transformer的输出和捕获不同大小器官的细节信息。

Result: MSA2-Net在四个医学图像数据集上表现出色：Synapse（86.49%）、ACDC（92.56%）、Kvasir（93.37%）和ISIC2017（92.98%）的Dice系数，证明了其鲁棒性和精确性。

Conclusion: 自适应卷积模块有效解决了内部超参数调优问题，MSA2-Net在多种医学图像分割任务中展现出卓越性能，为医学图像分析提供了强有力的工具。

Abstract: The nnUNet segmentation framework adeptly adjusts most hyperparameters in
training scripts automatically, but it overlooks the tuning of internal
hyperparameters within the segmentation network itself, which constrains the
model's ability to generalize. Addressing this limitation, this study presents
a novel Self-Adaptive Convolution Module that dynamically adjusts the size of
the convolution kernels depending on the unique fingerprints of different
datasets. This adjustment enables the MSA2-Net, when equipped with this module,
to proficiently capture both global and local features within the feature maps.
Self-Adaptive Convolution Module is strategically integrated into two key
components of the MSA2-Net: the Multi-Scale Convolution Bridge and the
Multi-Scale Amalgamation Decoder. In the MSConvBridge, the module enhances the
ability to refine outputs from various stages of the CSWin Transformer during
the skip connections, effectively eliminating redundant data that could
potentially impair the decoder's performance. Simultaneously, the MSADecoder,
utilizing the module, excels in capturing detailed information of organs
varying in size during the decoding phase. This capability ensures that the
decoder's output closely reproduces the intricate details within the feature
maps, thus yielding highly accurate segmentation images. MSA2-Net, bolstered by
this advanced architecture, has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving
Dice coefficient scores of 86.49\%, 92.56\%, 93.37\%, and 92.98\% on the
Synapse, ACDC, Kvasir, and Skin Lesion Segmentation (ISIC2017) datasets,
respectively. This underscores MSA2-Net's robustness and precision in medical
image segmentation tasks across various datasets.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in multimodal understanding tasks. However, the increasing demand
for high-resolution image and long-video understanding results in substantial
token counts, leading to reduced inference efficiency. Token compression offers
a direct solution by reducing the number of tokens to be processed, thereby
improving computational efficiency. Through extensive analysis, we identify two
critical limitations in existing inner-LLM token compression methods:
positional bias and incompatibility with efficient operators, which hinder
their practical deployment for LVLM acceleration. This paper presents the first
approach from a token variation perspective, revealing that visual token
variations within LLMs exhibit task-agnostic properties. We propose
Variation-aware Vision Token Dropping (\textit{i.e.}, \textbf{V$^2$Drop}),
which progressively removes visual tokens with minimal variation during LVLM
inference, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments
across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that our V$^2$Drop is able to
maintain \textbf{94.0\%} and \textbf{98.6\%} of the original model performance
for image and video understanding tasks respectively, while reducing LLM
generation latency by \textbf{31.5\%} and \textbf{74.2\%}. When combined with
efficient operators, V$^2$Drop further reduces GPU peak memory usage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用视觉语言模型在放射学中缺乏临床所需的判别精度，且公开的3D CT数据集存在稀缺性、异质性和标注格式不统一的问题，需要开发能够整合多样化监督信号的数据高效模型。

Method: 开发Uniferum体积VLM，统一处理分类标签和分割掩码等异质监督信号，通过协调三个具有不同标注的公共3D CT数据集，构建单一训练框架。

Result: 在CT-RATE基准上AUROC提升7%，展现出强大的分布外泛化能力，在RAD-CHEST和INSPECT数据集上观察到意外的零样本性能。

Conclusion: 整合异质标注和身体分割能有效提升模型性能，为临床可靠的3D医学影像数据高效VLM设定了新方向。

Abstract: General-purpose vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools
in radiology, offering zero-shot capabilities that mitigate the need for large
labeled datasets. However, in high-stakes domains like diagnostic radiology,
these models often lack the discriminative precision required for reliable
clinical use. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and heterogeneity of
publicly available volumetric CT datasets, which vary widely in annotation
formats and granularity. To address these limitations, we introduce Uniferum, a
volumetric VLM that unifies diverse supervision signals, encoded in
classification labels and segmentation masks, into a single training framework.
By harmonizing three public 3D CT datasets with distinct annotations, Uniferum
achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving AUROC on the CT-RATE benchmark
by 7% compared to CLIP-based and conventional multi-label convolutional models.
The model demonstrates robust out-of-distribution generalization, with observed
evidence of unexpected zero-shot performance on the RAD-CHEST and INSPECT
datasets. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating heterogeneous
annotations and body segmentation to enhance model performance, setting a new
direction for clinically reliable, data-efficient VLMs in 3D medical imaging.

TL;DR: HIFU-ILDiff是一种基于潜在扩散模型的深度学习新方法，能够有效抑制HIFU治疗中超声图像的干扰，实现实时监测，显著提升治疗精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HIFU治疗的成功和安全性依赖于实时监测，但使用超声引导HIFU治疗时存在干扰问题，影响监测效果。

Method: 采用Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE)将含噪超声图像编码到低维潜在空间，然后使用潜在扩散模型迭代去除干扰，最后解码重建高分辨率无干扰图像。

Result: HIFU-ILDiff在体外实验中SSIM达到0.796，PSNR达到23.780，显著优于Notch Filter方法（SSIM 0.443，PSNR 14.420），且处理速度达到15帧/秒，远快于Notch Filter的5秒/帧。

Conclusion: HIFU-ILDiff能够实时去噪HIFU干扰，为HIFU治疗提供精确的超声引导监测，将极大改善当前临床应用中的治疗精度。

Abstract: High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive therapeutic
technique widely used for treating various diseases. However, the success and
safety of HIFU treatments depend on real-time monitoring, which is often
hindered by interference when using ultrasound to guide HIFU treatment. To
address these challenges, we developed HIFU-ILDiff, a novel deep learning-based
approach leveraging latent diffusion models to suppress HIFU-induced
interference in ultrasound images. The HIFU-ILDiff model employs a Vector
Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode noisy ultrasound images
into a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by a latent diffusion model
that iteratively removes interference. The denoised latent vectors are then
decoded to reconstruct high-resolution, interference-free ultrasound images. We
constructed a comprehensive dataset comprising 18,872 image pairs from in vitro
phantoms, ex vivo tissues, and in vivo animal data across multiple imaging
modalities and HIFU power levels to train and evaluate the model. Experimental
results demonstrate that HIFU-ILDiff significantly outperforms the commonly
used Notch Filter method, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of
0.796 and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 23.780 compared to SSIM of 0.443
and PSNR of 14.420 for the Notch Filter under in vitro scenarios. Additionally,
HIFU-ILDiff achieves real-time processing at 15 frames per second, markedly
faster than the Notch Filter's 5 seconds per frame. These findings indicate
that HIFU-ILDiff is able to denoise HIFU interference in ultrasound guiding
images for real-time monitoring during HIFU therapy, which will greatly improve
the treatment precision in current clinical applications.

Motivation: 现有模型在处理视频内容时面临空间分辨率和时间覆盖之间的权衡困难，视频理解仍然是多模态任务中的挑战性领域。

Method: 1. 新颖的慢快视频编码策略：基于帧间相似性动态分配计算资源；2. 渐进式四阶段预训练：将上下文长度从8K扩展到128K token；3. 综合后训练流程：包括5步思维链数据构建、迭代GSPO强化学习和对齐训练。

Conclusion: 该模型通过创新的编码策略、渐进式训练方法和综合后训练流程，有效解决了视频理解中的核心挑战，为多模态视频分析提供了有力工具。

Abstract: In recent years, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
significantly advanced, extending their capabilities to multimodal tasks
through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, video understanding
remains a challenging area due to the dynamic and information-dense nature of
videos. Existing models struggle with the trade-off between spatial resolution
and temporal coverage when processing video content. We present Keye-VL-1.5,
which addresses fundamental challenges in video comprehension through three key
innovations. First, we introduce a novel Slow-Fast video encoding strategy that
dynamically allocates computational resources based on inter-frame similarity,
processing key frames with significant visual changes at higher resolution
(Slow pathway) while handling relatively static frames with increased temporal
coverage at lower resolution (Fast pathway). Second, we implement a progressive
four-stage pre-training methodology that systematically extends the model's
context length from 8K to 128K tokens, enabling processing of longer videos and
more complex visual content. Third, we develop a comprehensive post-training
pipeline focusing on reasoning enhancement and human preference alignment,
incorporating a 5-step chain-of-thought data construction process, iterative
GSPO-based reinforcement learning with progressive prompt hinting for difficult
cases, and alignment training. Through extensive evaluation on public
benchmarks and rigorous internal human assessment, Keye-VL-1.5 demonstrates
significant improvements over existing models, particularly excelling in video
understanding tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general
multimodal benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个不需要相机内参的通用单目视觉SLAM系统，使其能够适用于各种不同的相机设置，同时保持轻量级和高性能。

Method: 前端使用轻量级对称双视图关联(STA)模型，仅从两个RGB图像同时估计相对相机位姿和回归局部点云图；后端构建包含闭环检测的Sim(3)位姿图来处理累积漂移。

Result: 系统前端模型大小仅为同类最先进方法的35%，同时在相机跟踪和稠密3D重建质量方面实现了优于当前方法的性能。

Conclusion: ViSTA-SLAM提供了一个高效且通用的单目视觉SLAM解决方案，无需相机内参，在保持轻量级的同时实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: We present ViSTA-SLAM as a real-time monocular visual SLAM system that
operates without requiring camera intrinsics, making it broadly applicable
across diverse camera setups. At its core, the system employs a lightweight
symmetric two-view association (STA) model as the frontend, which
simultaneously estimates relative camera poses and regresses local pointmaps
from only two RGB images. This design reduces model complexity significantly,
the size of our frontend is only 35\% that of comparable state-of-the-art
methods, while enhancing the quality of two-view constraints used in the
pipeline. In the backend, we construct a specially designed Sim(3) pose graph
that incorporates loop closures to address accumulated drift. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in both
camera tracking and dense 3D reconstruction quality compared to current
methods. Github repository: https://github.com/zhangganlin/vista-slam

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型在视频编辑中面临挑战，需要为不同编辑任务设计不同的控制信号，导致模型设计复杂且需要大量训练资源。

Method: 提出O-DisCo-Edit框架，包含基于随机和自适应噪声的对象失真控制信号，以及用于保护未编辑区域的"复制形式"保护模块。

Result: 大量实验和综合人类评估表明，O-DisCo-Edit在各种视频编辑任务中超越了专业化和多任务的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一个统一的解决方案，能够灵活封装多种编辑线索，实现高效、高质量的多样化视频编辑。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video editing, yet controllable
editing remains challenging due to the need for precise manipulation of diverse
object properties. Current methods require different control signal for diverse
editing tasks, which complicates model design and demands significant training
resources. To address this, we propose O-DisCo-Edit, a unified framework that
incorporates a novel object distortion control (O-DisCo). This signal, based on
random and adaptive noise, flexibly encapsulates a wide range of editing cues
within a single representation. Paired with a "copy-form" preservation module
for preserving non-edited regions, O-DisCo-Edit enables efficient,
high-fidelity editing through an effective training paradigm. Extensive
experiments and comprehensive human evaluations consistently demonstrate that
O-DisCo-Edit surpasses both specialized and multitask state-of-the-art methods
across various video editing tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的视觉Transformer编码器-解码器模型，用于同时从两个角度分割导管并估计导管尖端的3D力，在合成X射线图像上优于现有最先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多任务深度学习模型使用CNN架构处理导管手术中的触觉和视觉感知，但需要逐步扩展感受野来捕获长距离依赖关系。本文希望从新角度解决这个问题。

Method: 使用视觉Transformer处理两个输入X射线图像作为独立序列，通过编码器-解码器架构捕获长距离依赖关系，使用共享分割头和回归头分别进行导管分割和3D力估计。

Result: 在具有不同噪声水平的合成X射线图像上进行广泛实验，模型在导管分割和力估计两方面都超越了现有最先进方法，创造了新的性能记录。

Conclusion: 提出的立体视觉Transformer模型能够有效同时处理导管分割和3D力估计任务，为导管手术提供了更准确的感知数据。

Abstract: Recently, the emergence of multitask deep learning models has enhanced
catheterization procedures by providing tactile and visual perception data
through an end-to-end architec- ture. This information is derived from a
segmentation and force estimation head, which localizes the catheter in X-ray
images and estimates the applied pressure based on its deflection within the
image. These stereo vision architectures incorporate a CNN- based
encoder-decoder that captures the dependencies between X-ray images from two
viewpoints, enabling simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo segmentation
of the catheter. With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem
from a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer
model that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given
sequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures
long-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive
field for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and
decoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head
employs the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation. The
proposed model is a stereo Vision Transformer capable of simultaneously
segmenting the catheter from two angles while estimating the generated forces
at its tip in 3D. This model has undergone extensive experiments on synthetic
X-ray images with various noise levels and has been compared against
state-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force
estimation methods, and a multitask catheter segmentation and force estimation
approach. It outperforms existing models, setting a new state-of-the-art in
both catheter segmentation and force estimation.

Result: 在15个基准测试中平均得分从48%提升至57%，显著改善模型性能

Conclusion: 同行评估可作为自监督对齐的可扩展替代方案，有效提升LVLM模型性能

Abstract: Traditional alignment methods for Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs)
primarily rely on human-curated preference data. Human-generated preference
data is costly; machine-generated preference data is limited in quality; and
self-supervised preference data often introduces hallucinations. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel Panel-of-Peers learning framework
inspired by collaborative learning among humans. This approach leverages a
panel of LVLMs, each evaluating and learning from their collective outputs
through an iterative self-improvement process. By simulating a peer review
system, our models generate, assess, and refine outputs in response to a
curated set of prompts, mimicking a classroom learning environment. We
demonstrate that this methodology enhances model performance without requiring
extensive human-labeled datasets. Our experiments show significant improvement
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of peer evaluations as
a scalable alternative to self-supervised alignment. Notably, we show that
Panel-of-Peers increases the average score on fifteen benchmarks from 48% to
57%

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Sched是一种新的后训练量化方法，通过调整扩散模型调度器而非模型权重，在4倍模型压缩下实现全精度准确率，显著提升few-step扩散模型的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型计算成本高，few-step模型虽然减少了去噪步骤但仍依赖大型未压缩的骨干网络，限制了后训练量化方法的应用。

Method: 提出Q-Sched范式，通过修改扩散模型调度器来调整few-step采样轨迹；引入JAQ损失函数，结合文本-图像兼容性和图像质量指标进行细粒度优化，无需全精度推理校准。

Result: 在FP16 4步潜在一致性模型上FID提升15.5%，在FP16 8步分阶段一致性模型上提升16.6%；大规模用户研究（80,000+标注）证实了在FLUX.1和SDXL-Turbo上的有效性。

Conclusion: 量化和few-step蒸馏在高保真生成方面具有互补性，Q-Sched为高效扩散模型推理提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models are computationally intensive, often requiring
dozens of forward passes through large transformer backbones. For instance,
Stable Diffusion XL generates high-quality images with 50 evaluations of a
2.6B-parameter model, an expensive process even for a single batch. Few-step
diffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on
large, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often
too costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These
requirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely
on full-precision calibration. We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for
post-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather
than model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched
achieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn
quantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss,
which combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for
fine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of
calibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration.
Q-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16
4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step
Phased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation
are complementary for high-fidelity generation. A large-scale user study with
more than 80,000 annotations further confirms Q-Sched's effectiveness on both
FLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo.

TL;DR: OpenVision 2简化了原版架构，移除文本编码器和对比损失，仅保留生成式标题损失，在保持性能的同时显著提升训练效率和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升OpenVision的训练效率，减少训练时间和内存消耗，同时保持多模态性能，为大规模视觉编码器开发提供轻量级方案。

Method: 移除文本编码器和对比损失，仅使用生成式标题损失进行纯生成式训练，简化架构设计。

Result: 训练时间减少1.5倍（83h→57h），内存使用减少1.8倍（24.5GB→13.8GB），批次大小从2k增至8k，参数量可扩展至10亿以上，性能与原版相当。

Conclusion: 纯生成式轻量级范式对未来多模态基础模型中视觉编码器开发具有重要价值，在保持性能的同时大幅提升训练效率。

Abstract: This paper provides a simplification on OpenVision's architecture and loss
design for enhancing its training efficiency. Following the prior
vision-language pretraining works CapPa and AIMv2, as well as modern multimodal
designs like LLaVA, our changes are straightforward: we remove the text encoder
(and therefore the contrastive loss), retaining only the captioning loss as a
purely generative training signal. We name this new version OpenVision 2. The
initial results are promising: despite this simplification, OpenVision 2
competitively matches the original model's performance on a broad set of
multimodal benchmarks while substantially cutting both training time and memory
consumption. For example, with ViT-L/14, it reduces training time by about 1.5x
(from 83h to 57h), and memory usage by about 1.8x (from 24.5GB to 13.8GB,
equivalently allowing the maximum batch size to grow from 2k to 8k). This
superior training efficiency also allows us to scale far beyond the largest
vision encoder used in OpenVision, reaching more than 1 billion parameters. We
hold a strong belief that this lightweight, generative-only paradigm is
compelling for future vision encoder development in multimodal foundation
models.

Abstract: Visual reasoning, a cornerstone of human intelligence, encompasses complex
perceptual and logical processes essential for solving diverse visual problems.
While advances in computer vision have produced powerful models for various
perceptual tasks, leveraging these for general visual reasoning remains
challenging. Prior work demonstrates that augmenting LLMs with vision models
via supervised finetuning improves performance, but faces key limitations such
as expensive data generation, reliance on careful data filtering, and poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose ReVPT to enhance
multi-modal LLMs' abilities to reason about and use visual tools through
reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel RL algorithm based on GRPO,
designed to train models to reason with a suite of four visual tools. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on several perception-heavy benchmarks, including SAT, CV-Bench,
BLINK and MMStar, significantly outperforming the supervised and text-based RL
finetuning baselines. Notably, Our ReVPT-3B and ReVPT-7B outperform the

Abstract: This paper investigates the utility of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for
multi-label classification of multispectral images using ResNet50 and DINOv2,
acknowledging the high dimensionality of such data and the associated
processing challenges. Multi-label classification, where each image may belong
to multiple classes, adds further complexity to feature extraction. Our
pipeline includes an optional PCA step that reduces the data to three
dimensions before feeding it into a three-layer classifier. The findings
demonstrate that the effectiveness of PCA for multi-label multispectral image
classification depends strongly on the chosen deep learning architecture and
training strategy, opening avenues for future research into self-supervised
pre-training and alternative dimensionality reduction approaches.

Abstract: Accurate classification of rock sizes is a vital component in geotechnical
engineering, mining, and resource management, where precise estimation
influences operational efficiency and safety. In this paper, we propose an
enhanced deep learning model based on the ConvNeXt architecture, augmented with
both self-attention and channel attention mechanisms. Building upon the
foundation of ConvNext, our proposed model, termed CNSCA, introduces
self-attention to capture long-range spatial dependencies and channel attention
to emphasize informative feature channels. This hybrid design enables the model
to effectively capture both fine-grained local patterns and broader contextual
relationships within rock imagery, leading to improved classification accuracy
and robustness. We evaluate our model on a rock size classification dataset and
compare it against three strong baseline. The results demonstrate that the
incorporation of attention mechanisms significantly enhances the models
capability for fine-grained classification tasks involving natural textures
like rocks.

Motivation: 有限角度CT成像虽然能提高时间分辨率和减少辐射剂量，但由于投影截断会产生严重伪影，需要解决这一病态重建问题

Method: 两阶段扩散框架：第一阶段使用基于transformer的扩散模型，仅基于临床元数据（采集参数、患者人口统计、诊断印象）从噪声生成粗略解剖先验；第二阶段整合粗略先验和元数据进一步细化图像。两个阶段都使用ADMM模块在每一步采样时强制执行基于物理的数据一致性

Result: 在合成和真实心脏CT数据集上的实验表明，引入元数据显著提高了重建保真度，特别是在严重角度截断情况下。相比无元数据的基线方法，在SSIM、PSNR、nMI和PCC指标上均取得更优性能

Conclusion: 不同类型的临床元数据提供互补优势，特别是在有限角度条件下，诊断和人口统计先验效果显著。这些发现强调了临床元数据在提高重建质量和效率方面的双重作用

Abstract: Limited-angle computed tomography (LACT) offers improved temporal resolution
and reduced radiation dose for cardiac imaging, but suffers from severe
artifacts due to truncated projections. To address the ill-posedness of LACT
reconstruction, we propose a two-stage diffusion framework guided by structured
clinical metadata. In the first stage, a transformer-based diffusion model
conditioned exclusively on metadata, including acquisition parameters, patient
demographics, and diagnostic impressions, generates coarse anatomical priors
from noise. The second stage further refines the images by integrating both the
coarse prior and metadata to produce high-fidelity results. Physics-based data
consistency is enforced at each sampling step in both stages using an
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers module, ensuring alignment with the
measured projections. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real cardiac
CT datasets demonstrate that incorporating metadata significantly improves
reconstruction fidelity, particularly under severe angular truncation. Compared
to existing metadata-free baselines, our method achieves superior performance
in SSIM, PSNR, nMI, and PCC. Ablation studies confirm that different types of
metadata contribute complementary benefits, particularly diagnostic and
demographic priors under limited-angle conditions. These findings highlight the
dual role of clinical metadata in improving both reconstruction quality and
efficiency, supporting their integration into future metadata-guided medical
imaging frameworks.

Abstract: Surface defects in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) pose significant risks to
the structural integrity of additively manufactured components. This paper
introduces TransMatch, a novel framework that merges transfer learning and
semi-supervised few-shot learning to address the scarcity of labeled AM defect
data. By effectively leveraging both labeled and unlabeled novel-class images,

TL;DR: 提出平衡信息瓶颈(BIB)和混合平衡信息瓶颈(MBIB)方法，通过损失函数重平衡和自蒸馏技术改进信息瓶颈网络，在长尾视觉识别任务中达到state-of-the-art性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的视觉识别数据通常是长尾分布的，这给深度神经网络的训练和部署带来挑战。传统信息瓶颈方法在处理长尾数据时效果有限，需要新的方法来学习足够的表示并保留关键的标签相关信息。

Method: 1. 提出平衡信息瓶颈(BIB)：将损失函数重平衡和自蒸馏技术整合到原始信息瓶颈网络中；2. 提出混合平衡信息瓶颈(MBIB)：多个BIB组合，每个负责整合不同网络层的知识，实现端到端学习；3. 从信息论角度同时训练表示和分类。

Conclusion: 所提出的BIB和MBIB方法能够有效解决长尾视觉识别问题，通过学习充分表示并保留关键标签信息，在多个基准数据集上实现了state-of-the-art的性能表现。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved significant success in various
applications with large-scale and balanced data. However, data in real-world
visual recognition are usually long-tailed, bringing challenges to efficient
training and deployment of DNNs. Information bottleneck (IB) is an elegant
approach for representation learning. In this paper, we propose a balanced
information bottleneck (BIB) approach, in which loss function re-balancing and
self-distillation techniques are integrated into the original IB network. BIB
is thus capable of learning a sufficient representation with essential
label-related information fully preserved for long-tailed visual recognition.
To further enhance the representation learning capability, we also propose a
novel structure of mixture of multiple balanced information bottlenecks (MBIB),
where different BIBs are responsible for combining knowledge from different
network layers. MBIB facilitates an end-to-end learning strategy that trains
representation and classification simultaneously from an information theory
perspective. We conduct experiments on commonly used long-tailed datasets,
including CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018. Both BIB and MBIB
reach state-of-the-art performance for long-tailed visual recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常在特定领域的大规模数据集上训练，限制了基础模型的泛化能力和适用性。本文旨在利用生成模型的基础知识来实现实用且通用的图像重光照。

Method: 基于光照关系与自注意力层中token交互相似的洞察，训练轻量级LoRA回归器生成直接辐照度图，然后使用分类器引导将所需光照融入图像生成过程。

Result: 在多种场景类型上展示了最先进的性能，在质量和控制方面优于领先工作，同时证明了参数和数据效率。

Conclusion: 这项工作证实了通过挖掘基础知识可以可行地控制图像光照，实现了实用和通用的重光照。

Abstract: Light control in generated images is a difficult task, posing specific
challenges, spanning over the entire image and frequency spectrum. Most
approaches tackle this problem by training on extensive yet domain-specific
datasets, limiting the inherent generalization and applicability of the
foundational backbones used. Instead, PractiLight is a practical approach,
effectively leveraging foundational understanding of recent generative models
for the task. Our key insight is that lighting relationships in an image are
similar in nature to token interaction in self-attention layers, and hence are
best represented there. Based on this and other analyses regarding the
importance of early diffusion iterations, PractiLight trains a lightweight LoRA
regressor to produce the direct irradiance map for a given image, using a small
set of training images. We then employ this regressor to incorporate the
desired lighting into the generation process of another image using Classifier
Guidance. This careful design generalizes well to diverse conditions and image
domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality and
control with proven parameter and data efficiency compared to leading works
over a wide variety of scenes types. We hope this work affirms that image
lighting can feasibly be controlled by tapping into foundational knowledge,
enabling practical and general relighting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖单细胞RNA测序参考，存在对齐质量依赖、外部数据集依赖、批次效应和数据丢失继承等问题，需要开发无参考的解决方案。

Method: 提出LGDiST模型，利用之前被认为无信息的上下文基因构建丰富的生物学意义遗传潜在空间，采用扩散模型架构，包含邻居条件等关键组件。

Result: 在基因表达补全任务上超越现有最佳方法18%的MSE，在6种先进方法上提升预测性能达10%，关键组件移除会导致性能显著下降。

Conclusion: LGDiST的完整架构实现了显著优于任何单独组件的性能，证明了无参考方法在空间转录组学数据补全中的有效性。

Abstract: Computer Vision has proven to be a powerful tool for analyzing Spatial
Transcriptomics (ST) data. However, current models that predict spatially
resolved gene expression from histopathology images suffer from significant
limitations due to data dropout. Most existing approaches rely on single-cell
RNA sequencing references, making them dependent on alignment quality and
external datasets while also risking batch effects and inherited dropout. In
this paper, we address these limitations by introducing LGDiST, the first
reference-free latent gene diffusion model for ST data dropout. We show that
LGDiST outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in gene expression completion,
with an average Mean Squared Error that is 18% lower across 26 datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that completing ST data with LGDiST improves gene
expression prediction performance on six state-of-the-art methods up to 10% in
MSE. A key innovation of LGDiST is using context genes previously considered
uninformative to build a rich and biologically meaningful genetic latent space.
Our experiments show that removing key components of LGDiST, such as the
context genes, the ST latent space, and the neighbor conditioning, leads to
considerable drops in performance. These findings underscore that the full
architecture of LGDiST achieves substantially better performance than any of
its isolated components.

Abstract: Object detection is crucial for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) to
perceive their surroundings and make safe driving decisions. Centralized
training of object detection models often achieves promising accuracy, fast
convergence, and simplified training process, but it falls short in
scalability, adaptability, and privacy-preservation. Federated learning (FL),
by contrast, enables collaborative, privacy-preserving, and continuous training
across naturally distributed CAV fleets. However, deploying FL in real-world
CAVs remains challenging due to the substantial computational demands of
training and inference, coupled with highly diverse operating conditions.
Practical deployment must address three critical factors: (i) heterogeneity
from non-IID data distributions, (ii) constrained onboard computing hardware,
and (iii) environmental variability such as lighting and weather, alongside
systematic evaluation to ensure reliable performance. This work introduces the
first holistic deployment-oriented evaluation of FL-based object detection in
CAVs, integrating model performance, system-level resource profiling, and
environmental robustness. Using state-of-the-art detectors, YOLOv5, YOLOv8,
YOLOv11, and Deformable DETR, evaluated on the KITTI, BDD100K, and nuScenes
datasets, we analyze trade-offs between detection accuracy, computational cost,
and resource usage under diverse resolutions, batch sizes, weather and lighting
conditions, and dynamic client participation, paving the way for robust FL
deployment in CAVs.

Abstract: Modern deep learning developments create new opportunities for 3D mapping
technology, scene reconstruction pipelines, and virtual reality development.
Despite advances in 3D deep learning technology, direct training of deep
learning models on 3D data faces challenges due to the high dimensionality
inherent in 3D data and the scarcity of labeled datasets. Structure-from-motion
(SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) exhibit robust
performance when applied to structured indoor environments but often struggle
with ambiguous features in unstructured environments. These techniques often
struggle to generate detailed geometric representations effective for
downstream tasks such as rendering and semantic analysis. Current limitations
require the development of 3D representation methods that combine traditional
geometric techniques with deep learning capabilities to generate robust
geometry-aware deep learning models.
  The dissertation provides solutions to the fundamental challenges in 3D
vision by developing geometric deep learning methods tailored for essential
tasks such as camera pose estimation, point cloud registration, depth
prediction, and 3D reconstruction. The integration of geometric priors or
constraints, such as including depth information, surface normals, and
equivariance into deep learning models, enhances both the accuracy and
robustness of geometric representations. This study systematically investigates
key components of 3D vision, including camera pose estimation, point cloud
registration, depth estimation, and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction,
demonstrating their effectiveness across real-world applications such as
digital cultural heritage preservation and immersive VR/AR environments.

Abstract: Ongoing advancements in computer vision, particularly in pattern recognition
and scene classification, have enabled new applications in environmental
monitoring. Deep learning now offers non-contact methods for assessing water
quality and detecting contamination, both critical for disaster response and
public health protection. This work introduces HydroVision, a deep
learning-based scene classification framework that estimates optically active
water quality parameters including Chlorophyll-Alpha, Chlorophylls, Colored
Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Phycocyanins, Suspended Sediments, and
Turbidity from standard Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images of surface water.
HydroVision supports early detection of contamination trends and strengthens
monitoring by regulatory agencies during external environmental stressors,
industrial activities, and force majeure events. The model is trained on more
than 500,000 seasonally varied images collected from the United States
Geological Survey Hydrologic Imagery Visualization and Information System
between 2022 and 2024. This approach leverages widely available RGB imagery as
a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional multispectral and
hyperspectral remote sensing. Four state-of-the-art convolutional neural
networks (VGG-16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121) and a Vision Transformer
are evaluated through transfer learning to identify the best-performing
architecture. DenseNet121 achieves the highest validation performance, with an
R2 score of 0.89 in predicting CDOM, demonstrating the framework's promise for
real-world water quality monitoring across diverse conditions. While the
current model is optimized for well-lit imagery, future work will focus on
improving robustness under low-light and obstructed scenarios to expand its
operational utility.

Abstract: The escalating intensity and frequency of wildfires demand innovative
computational methods for rapid and accurate property damage assessment.
Traditional methods are often time consuming, while modern computer vision
approaches typically require extensive labeled datasets, hindering immediate
post-disaster deployment. This research introduces a novel, zero-shot framework
leveraging pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) to classify damage from
ground-level imagery. We propose and evaluate two pipelines applied to the 2025
Eaton and Palisades fires in California, a VLM (Pipeline A) and a VLM + large
language model (LLM) approach (Pipeline B), that integrate structured prompts
based on specific wildfire damage indicators. A primary scientific contribution
of this study is demonstrating the VLMs efficacy in synthesizing information
from multiple perspectives to identify nuanced damage, a critical limitation in
existing literature. Our findings reveal that while single view assessments
struggled to classify affected structures (F1 scores ranging from 0.225 to
0.511), the multi-view analysis yielded dramatic improvements (F1 scores
ranging from 0.857 to 0.947). Moreover, the McNemar test confirmed that
pipelines with a multi-view image assessment yields statistically significant
classification improvements; however, the improvements this research observed
between Pipeline A and B were not statistically significant. Thus, future
research can explore the potential of LLM prompting in damage assessment. The
practical contribution is an immediately deployable, flexible, and
interpretable workflow that bypasses the need for supervised training,
significantly accelerating triage and prioritization for disaster response
practitioners.

Abstract: Although large scale models achieve significant improvements in performance,
the overfitting challenge still frequently undermines their generalization
ability. In super resolution tasks on images, diffusion models as
representatives of generative models typically adopt large scale architectures.
However, few-shot drone-captured infrared training data frequently induces
severe overfitting in large-scale architectures. To address this key challenge,
our method proposes a new Gaussian quantization representation learning method
oriented to diffusion models that alleviates overfitting and enhances
robustness. At the same time, an effective monitoring mechanism tracks large
scale architectures during training to detect signs of overfitting. By
introducing Gaussian quantization representation learning, our method
effectively reduces overfitting while maintaining architecture complexity. On
this basis, we construct a multi source drone-based infrared image benchmark
dataset for detection and use it to emphasize overfitting issues of large scale
architectures in few sample, drone-based diverse drone-based image
reconstruction scenarios. To verify the efficacy of the method in mitigating
overfitting, experiments are conducted on the constructed benchmark.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing super
resolution approaches and significantly mitigates overfitting of large scale
architectures under complex conditions. The code and DroneSR dataset will be

Result: 方法超越GeoCLIP的地理定位精度，在多种地理预测任务中都提升了性能

Conclusion: 首次将可解释性引入地理定位领域，为地理决策过程提供了丰富的语义见解

Abstract: Worldwide geo-localization involves determining the exact geographic location
of images captured globally, typically guided by geographic cues such as
climate, landmarks, and architectural styles. Despite advancements in
geo-localization models like GeoCLIP, which leverages images and location
alignment via contrastive learning for accurate predictions, the
interpretability of these models remains insufficiently explored. Current
concept-based interpretability methods fail to align effectively with
Geo-alignment image-location embedding objectives, resulting in suboptimal
interpretability and performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel
framework integrating global geo-localization with concept bottlenecks. Our
method inserts a Concept-Aware Alignment Module that jointly projects image and
location embeddings onto a shared bank of geographic concepts (e.g., tropical
climate, mountain, cathedral) and minimizes a concept-level loss, enhancing
alignment in a concept-specific subspace and enabling robust interpretability.
To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce interpretability into
geo-localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses
GeoCLIP in geo-localization accuracy and boosts performance across diverse
geospatial prediction tasks, revealing richer semantic insights into geographic
decision-making processes.

Abstract: Multimodal models, such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)

  In this paper, we introduce a novel training paradigm explicitly designed to
enhance the comprehension of diagrammatic images within vision-language models.
Our approach uses ``hard'' samples for our proposed contrastive learning that
incorporates two specialised loss functions that leverage the inherent
structural properties of diagrams. By integrating these objectives into model
training, our method enables models to develop a more structured and
semantically coherent understanding of diagrammatic content.
  We empirically validate our approach on a benchmark dataset of flowcharts, as
a representative class of diagrammatic imagery, demonstrating substantial
improvements over standard CLIP and conventional hard negative CLIP learning
paradigms for both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks. Our
findings underscore the significance of tailored training strategies for
specialised tasks and contribute to advancing diagrammatic understanding within
the broader landscape of vision-language integration.

Conclusion: 2D高斯泼溅技术能够有效应用于图像修复任务，其连续渲染范式天然促进像素级一致性，结合DINO的全局特征可以确保语义一致性，为相关领域提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS), a recent technique for converting discrete points
into continuous spatial representations, has shown promising results in 3D
scene modeling and 2D image super-resolution. In this paper, we explore its
untapped potential for image inpainting, which demands both locally coherent
pixel synthesis and globally consistent semantic restoration. We propose the
first image inpainting framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which encodes
incomplete images into a continuous field of 2D Gaussian splat coefficients and
reconstructs the final image via a differentiable rasterization process. The
continuous rendering paradigm of GS inherently promotes pixel-level coherence
in the inpainted results. To improve efficiency and scalability, we introduce a
patch-wise rasterization strategy that reduces memory overhead and accelerates
inference. For global semantic consistency, we incorporate features from a
pretrained DINO model. We observe that DINO's global features are naturally
robust to small missing regions and can be effectively adapted to guide
semantic alignment in large-mask scenarios, ensuring that the inpainted content
remains contextually consistent with the surrounding scene. Extensive
experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality,
establishing a new direction for applying Gaussian Splatting to 2D image
processing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件相机的视觉地点识别集成方法，通过融合多种事件-帧重建、特征提取器和时间分辨率，在严重光照变化下实现鲁棒性能，在昼夜转换中Recall@1相对提升57%。


<details>

Motivation: 事件相机具有高动态范围和低延迟优势，但在严重光照变化下的视觉地点识别仍是一个开放研究问题，需要开发更鲁棒的框架。

Method: 采用集成学习方法，结合多种事件-帧重建方法、VPR特征提取器和时间分辨率的序列匹配结果，相比之前仅利用时间分辨率的集成方法，提出了更广泛的融合策略。

Result: 在两个长距离驾驶数据集（每次遍历8公里）上评估，不进行度量子采样，保持了速度和停车持续时间的自然变化。在昼夜转换条件下Recall@1相对提升57%。

Conclusion: 该方法在严重光照变化下表现出显著改进的鲁棒性，通过综合分析确定了关键设计选择，并提出了改进的标准序列匹配框架，将发布代码库和基准测试框架以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Compared to conventional cameras, event cameras provide a high dynamic range
and low latency, offering greater robustness to rapid motion and challenging
lighting conditions. Although the potential of event cameras for visual place
recognition (VPR) has been established, developing robust VPR frameworks under
severe illumination changes remains an open research problem. In this paper, we
introduce an ensemble-based approach to event camera place recognition that
combines sequence-matched results from multiple event-to-frame reconstructions,
VPR feature extractors, and temporal resolutions. Unlike previous event-based
ensemble methods, which only utilise temporal resolution, our broader fusion
strategy delivers significantly improved robustness under varied lighting
conditions (e.g., afternoon, sunset, night), achieving a 57% relative
improvement in Recall@1 across day-night transitions. We evaluate our approach
on two long-term driving datasets (with 8 km per traverse) without metric
subsampling, thereby preserving natural variations in speed and stop duration
that influence event density. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of key
design choices, including binning strategies, polarity handling, reconstruction
methods, and feature extractors, to identify the most critical components for
robust performance. Additionally, we propose a modification to the standard
sequence matching framework that enhances performance at longer sequence
lengths. To facilitate future research, we will release our codebase and
benchmarking framework.

TL;DR: MOSAIC是一个基于表示学习的多主体个性化生成框架，通过语义对齐和正交特征解耦解决多参考主体生成中的身份混合和属性泄漏问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多主体生成方法存在身份混合和属性泄漏问题，主要原因是缺乏对多主体在共享表示空间中如何交互的充分建模

Method: 提出SemAlign-MS数据集提供细粒度语义对应关系；使用语义对应注意力损失确保精确的点对点语义对齐；开发多参考解耦损失将不同主体推入正交注意力子空间

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，能够在4+参考主体情况下保持高保真度，而现有方法通常在3个主体以上性能下降

Conclusion: MOSAIC通过表示层面的精确语义对齐和特征解耦，为复杂多主体合成应用开辟了新可能性

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized generation presents unique challenges in
maintaining identity fidelity and semantic coherence when synthesizing images
conditioned on multiple reference subjects. Existing methods often suffer from
identity blending and attribute leakage due to inadequate modeling of how
different subjects should interact within shared representation spaces. We
present MOSAIC, a representation-centric framework that rethinks multi-subject
generation through explicit semantic correspondence and orthogonal feature
disentanglement. Our key insight is that multi-subject generation requires
precise semantic alignment at the representation level - knowing exactly which
regions in the generated image should attend to which parts of each reference.
To enable this, we introduce SemAlign-MS, a meticulously annotated dataset
providing fine-grained semantic correspondences between multiple reference
subjects and target images, previously unavailable in this domain. Building on
this foundation, we propose the semantic correspondence attention loss to
enforce precise point-to-point semantic alignment, ensuring high consistency
from each reference to its designated regions. Furthermore, we develop the
multi-reference disentanglement loss to push different subjects into orthogonal
attention subspaces, preventing feature interference while preserving
individual identity characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MOSAIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Notably,
while existing methods typically degrade beyond 3 subjects, MOSAIC maintains
high fidelity with 4+ reference subjects, opening new possibilities for complex
multi-subject synthesis applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然条件生成已被广泛探索，但无需额外训练即可进行提示引导图像编辑的能力同样重要，因为它支持众多实际应用。

Method: 提出VARIN方法，利用新颖的伪逆函数Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI)进行argmax采样，生成逆Gumbel噪声，实现源图像精确重建和可控编辑。

Result: 大量实验表明VARIN能有效根据指定提示修改源图像，同时显著保留原始背景和结构细节。

Conclusion: VARIN被验证为一种实用的编辑方法，为VAR模型提供了有效的文本到图像编辑能力。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive models (VAR) have recently emerged as a promising class
of generative models, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models in
text-to-image generation tasks. While conditional generation has been widely
explored, the ability to perform prompt-guided image editing without additional
training is equally critical, as it supports numerous practical real-world
applications. This paper investigates the text-to-image editing capabilities of
VAR by introducing Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN), the first noise
inversion-based editing technique designed explicitly for VAR models. VARIN
leverages a novel pseudo-inverse function for argmax sampling, named
Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI), to generate inverse Gumbel noises. These
inverse noises enable precise reconstruction of the source image and facilitate
targeted, controllable edits aligned with textual prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that VARIN effectively modifies source images according
to specified prompts while significantly preserving the original background and
structural details, thus validating its efficacy as a practical editing
approach.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态统一模型在文本到图像生成方面表现良好，但在精确图像编辑方面存在困难，主要原因是理解模块和生成模块之间的责任分配不平衡。

Method: 构建包含1400万图像-文本对的DIM-T2I和23.3万思维链想象的DIM-Edit数据集，通过轻量级MLP连接冻结的Qwen2.5-VL-3B和可训练的SANA1.5-1.6B模型。

Result: DIM-4.6B-Edit在ImgEdit和GEdit-Bench基准测试中达到SOTA或竞争性性能，超越了UniWorld-V1和Step1X-Edit等更大模型。

Conclusion: 将设计责任明确分配给理解模块对图像编辑任务有显著益处，证明了平衡责任分配的重要性。

Abstract: In recent years, integrating multimodal understanding and generation into a
single unified model has emerged as a promising paradigm. While this approach
achieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles
with precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced
division of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a
translator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the
generation module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring
the original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the
new content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding
module is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning
tasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce
Draw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i)
DIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex
instruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K
chain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design
blueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable
SANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM
dataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit. Despite its modest parameter scale,
DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves SOTA or competitive performance on the ImgEdit and
GEdit-Bench benchmarks, outperforming much larger models such as UniWorld-V1
and Step1X-Edit. These findings demonstrate that explicitly assigning the
design responsibility to the understanding module provides significant benefits
for image editing. Our dataset and models will be available at

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has achieved unprecedented success in various
computer vision tasks, particularly in object detection. However, the black-box
nature and high complexity of deep neural networks pose significant challenges
for interpretability, especially in critical domains such as autonomous
driving, medical imaging, and security systems. Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) aims to address this challenge by providing tools and
methods to make model decisions more transparent, interpretable, and
trust-worthy for humans. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of
state-of-the-art explain-ability methods specifically applied to object
detection models. The paper be-gins by categorizing existing XAI techniques
based on their underlying mechanisms-perturbation-based, gradient-based,
backpropagation-based, and graph-based methods. Notable methods such as D-RISE,
BODEM, D-CLOSE, and FSOD are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the paper
investigates their applicability to various object detection architectures,
including YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and EfficientDet. Statistical analysis of
publication trends from 2022 to mid-2025 shows an accelerating interest in
explainable object detection, indicating its increasing importance. The study
also explores common datasets and evaluation metrics, and highlights the major
challenges associated with model interpretability. By providing a structured
taxonomy and a critical assessment of existing methods, this review aims to
guide researchers and practitioners in selecting suitable explainability
techniques for object detection applications and to foster the development of

TL;DR: Palette-Adapter是一种新颖的方法，通过将调色板解释为稀疏直方图并引入熵和距离控制参数，来解决文本到图像扩散模型中调色板条件化的模糊性和不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调色板是创意工作流程中广泛使用的直观工具，但在图像生成中作为条件使用时存在显著的模糊性和不稳定性，需要一种能够灵活控制调色板遵循度和颜色变化的方法。

Method: 将调色板解释为稀疏直方图，引入直方图熵和调色板到直方图距离两个标量控制参数，使用负直方图机制抑制不需要的色调，并在精心策划的数据集上进行训练以确保颜色空间的广泛泛化。

Result: 该方法在定性和定量评估以及用户研究中一致优于现有方法，在实现强调色板遵循度和高图像质量方面表现优异。

Conclusion: Palette-Adapter提供了一种稳定、语义连贯的图像生成方法，能够广泛适用于各种调色板和提示，有效解决了调色板条件化中的挑战。

Abstract: We introduce the Palette-Adapter, a novel method for conditioning
text-to-image diffusion models on a user-specified color palette. While
palettes are a compact and intuitive tool widely used in creative workflows,
they introduce significant ambiguity and instability when used for conditioning
image generation. Our approach addresses this challenge by interpreting
palettes as sparse histograms and introducing two scalar control parameters:
histogram entropy and palette-to-histogram distance, which allow flexible
control over the degree of palette adherence and color variation. We further
introduce a negative histogram mechanism that allows users to suppress specific
undesired hues, improving adherence to the intended palette under the standard
classifier-free guidance mechanism. To ensure broad generalization across the
color space, we train on a carefully curated dataset with balanced coverage of
rare and common colors. Our method enables stable, semantically coherent
generation across a wide range of palettes and prompts. We evaluate our method
qualitatively, quantitatively, and through a user study, and show that it
consistently outperforms existing approaches in achieving both strong palette
adherence and high image quality.

Motivation: 解决低资源环境中早产儿监测面临的挑战，去除依赖人工观察或侵入式传感器的局限性，这些方法容易出错、不实用且可能造成皮肤损伤。

Method: 设计了一种嵌入式监测系统，采用轻量化的MobileNet模型部署在Raspberry Pi上进行实时行为状态检测，集成了三项关键创新：模型轻量化、Raspberry Pi优化视觉管道和安全IoT通信。

Result: 系统在公开定期儿图像数据集上达到了领先的准确度：睡眠检测91.8%，哭泣/正常分类97.7%，同时轻量化减少了68%的模型大小。

Conclusion: 轻量化优化的MobileNet模型是建立可扩展、低成本且临床可行的NICU监测系统的最可行基础，为改善资源突出环境中的早产儿护理抓埋了基础。

Abstract: Preterm birth remains a leading cause of neonatal mortality,
disproportionately affecting low-resource settings with limited access to
advanced neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).Continuous monitoring of infant
behavior, such as sleep/awake states and crying episodes, is critical but
relies on manual observation or invasive sensors, which are prone to error,
impractical, and can cause skin damage. This paper presents a novel,
noninvasive, and automated vision-based framework to address this gap. We
introduce an embedded monitoring system that utilizes a quantized MobileNet
model deployed on a Raspberry Pi for real-time behavioral state detection. When
trained and evaluated on public neonatal image datasets, our system achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy (91.8% for sleep detection and 97.7% for
crying/normal classification) while maintaining computational efficiency
suitable for edge deployment. Through comparative benchmarking, we provide a
critical analysis of the trade-offs between model size, inference latency, and
diagnostic accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that while larger architectures
(e.g., ResNet152, VGG19) offer marginal gains in accuracy, their computational
cost is prohibitive for real-time edge use. The proposed framework integrates
three key innovations: model quantization for memory-efficient inference (68%
reduction in size), Raspberry Pi-optimized vision pipelines, and secure IoT
communication for clinical alerts. This work conclusively shows that
lightweight, optimized models such as the MobileNet offer the most viable
foundation for scalable, low-cost, and clinically actionable NICU monitoring
systems, paving the way for improved preterm care in resource-constrained
environments.

Motivation: 尽管RMOT系统在语言-视觉理解方面取得了进展，但其安全性和鲁棒性研究不足。本文从设计逻辑角度分析RMOT系统的安全影响，识别对抗性漏洞。

Method: 提出VEIL对抗攻击框架，针对RMOT系统的语言-视觉指代和目标匹配组件进行攻击，特别针对采用FIFO内存的先进RMOT模型，通过精心设计的数字和物理扰动破坏时空推理。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了RMOT系统存在严重的安全漏洞，强调了在关键大规模应用中需要安全感知的RMOT设计的紧迫性。

Abstract: Language-vision understanding has driven the development of advanced
perception systems, most notably the emerging paradigm of Referring
Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT). By leveraging natural-language queries, RMOT
systems can selectively track objects that satisfy a given semantic
description, guided through Transformer-based spatial-temporal reasoning
modules. End-to-End (E2E) RMOT models further unify feature extraction,
temporal memory, and spatial reasoning within a Transformer backbone, enabling
long-range spatial-temporal modeling over fused textual-visual representations.
Despite these advances, the reliability and robustness of RMOT remain
underexplored. In this paper, we examine the security implications of RMOT
systems from a design-logic perspective, identifying adversarial
vulnerabilities that compromise both the linguistic-visual referring and
track-object matching components. Additionally, we uncover a novel
vulnerability in advanced RMOT models employing FIFO-based memory, whereby
targeted and consistent attacks on their spatial-temporal reasoning introduce
errors that persist within the history buffer over multiple subsequent frames.
We present VEIL, a novel adversarial framework designed to disrupt the unified
referring-matching mechanisms of RMOT models. We show that carefully crafted
digital and physical perturbations can corrupt the tracking logic reliability,
inducing track ID switches and terminations. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations using the Refer-KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of VEIL
and demonstrate the urgent need for security-aware RMOT designs for critical
large-scale applications.

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a new method per se. Instead, we build on
existing self-supervised learning approaches for vision, drawing inspiration
from the adage "fake it till you make it". While contrastive self-supervised
learning has achieved remarkable success, it typically relies on vast amounts
of real-world data and carefully curated hard negatives. To explore
alternatives to these requirements, we investigate two forms of "faking it" in
vision transformers. First, we study the potential of generative models for
unsupervised representation learning, leveraging synthetic data to augment
sample diversity. Second, we examine the feasibility of generating synthetic
hard negatives in the representation space, creating diverse and challenging
contrasts. Our framework - dubbed Syn2Co - combines both approaches and
evaluates whether synthetically enhanced training can lead to more robust and
transferable visual representations on DeiT-S and Swin-T architectures. Our
findings highlight the promise and limitations of synthetic data in
self-supervised learning, offering insights for future work in this direction.

Abstract: We propose RocketScience, an open-source contrastive VLM benchmark that tests

image-text pairs covering mostly relative spatial understanding and the order

  to be very easy for humans and hard for the current generation of VLMs, and
this is empirically verified. Our results show a striking lack of spatial
relation understanding in open source and frontier commercial VLMs and a
surprisingly high performance of reasoning models. Additionally, we perform a
disentanglement analysis to separate the contributions of object localization
and spatial reasoning in chain-of-thought-based models and find that the
performance on the benchmark is bottlenecked by spatial reasoning and not
object localization capabilities.

Conclusion: 所提出的ContextFusion和Bootstrap Branch能够无缝集成到现有slot attention模型中，有效解决了语义信息不足和编码器微调限制的问题

Abstract: A key human ability is to decompose a scene into distinct objects and use
their relationships to understand the environment. Object-centric learning aims
to mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot
attention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and
has been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot
attention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic
information. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on
low-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly
sensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object
contours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to
fine-tune the encoder. Current methods require a stable feature space
throughout training to enable reconstruction from slots, which restricts the
flexibility needed for effective object-centric learning. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel ContextFusion stage and a Bootstrap Branch,
both of which can be seamlessly integrated into existing slot attention models.
In the ContextFusion stage, we exploit semantic information from the foreground
and background, incorporating an auxiliary indicator that provides additional
contextual cues about them to enrich the semantic content beyond low-level
features. In the Bootstrap Branch, we decouple feature adaptation from the
original reconstruction phase and introduce a bootstrap strategy to train a
feature-adaptive mechanism, allowing for more flexible adaptation. Experimental
results show that our method significantly improves the performance of
different SOTA slot attention models on both simulated and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is a challenging task as models are
required to generalize across numerous attributes in real-world data.
Traditional approaches focus on complex methods, yet recognition performance is
often constrained by training dataset limitations, particularly the
under-representation of certain attributes. In this paper, we propose a
data-centric approach to improve PAR by synthetic data augmentation guided by
textual descriptions. First, we define a protocol to identify weakly recognized
attributes across multiple datasets. Second, we propose a prompt-driven
pipeline that leverages diffusion models to generate synthetic pedestrian
images while preserving the consistency of PAR datasets. Finally, we derive a
strategy to seamlessly incorporate synthetic samples into training data, which
considers prompt-based annotation rules and modifies the loss function. Results
on popular PAR datasets demonstrate that our approach not only boosts
recognition of underrepresented attributes but also improves overall model
performance beyond the targeted attributes. Notably, this approach strengthens
zero-shot generalization without requiring architectural changes of the model,
presenting an efficient and scalable solution to improve the recognition of
attributes of pedestrians in the real world.

*Matic Fučka,Vitjan Zavrtanik,Danijel Skočaj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SALAD是一个语义感知的判别式逻辑异常检测方法，通过新的组合分支显式建模对象组合图的分布，在MVTec LOCO基准上达到96.1%的图像级AUROC，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表面异常检测方法擅长检测结构异常（如凹痕、划痕），但在逻辑异常（如不规则或缺失的物体组件）检测上表现不佳。现有最佳方法依赖聚合预训练特征或手工描述符，丢弃了空间和语义信息。

Method: 提出SALAD方法，包含新设计的组合分支来显式建模对象组合图的分布，学习重要语义关系。同时引入无需手工标签或类别特定信息的组合图提取新流程。

Result: 在标准逻辑异常检测基准MVTec LOCO上，SALAD显著优于现有最先进方法，实现了96.1%的令人印象深刻的图像级AUROC。

Conclusion: 通过有效建模组合图分布，SALAD方法在逻辑异常检测方面取得了显著改进，证明了语义感知方法在此任务上的有效性。

Abstract: Recent surface anomaly detection methods excel at identifying structural
anomalies, such as dents and scratches, but struggle with logical anomalies,
such as irregular or missing object components. The best-performing logical
anomaly detection approaches rely on aggregated pretrained features or
handcrafted descriptors (most often derived from composition maps), which
discard spatial and semantic information, leading to suboptimal performance. We
propose SALAD, a semantics-aware discriminative logical anomaly detection
method that incorporates a newly proposed composition branch to explicitly
model the distribution of object composition maps, consequently learning
important semantic relationships. Additionally, we introduce a novel procedure
for extracting composition maps that requires no hand-made labels or
category-specific information, in contrast to previous methods. By effectively
modelling the composition map distribution, SALAD significantly improves upon
state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark for logical anomaly
detection, MVTec LOCO, achieving an impressive image-level AUROC of 96.1%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NOOUGAT是一个统一的多目标跟踪框架，打破了传统在线和离线跟踪的界限，通过图神经网络和自回归长时跟踪层实现任意时间跨度的跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统在线和离线多目标跟踪方法在现实部署场景中灵活性不足的问题，在线跟踪器难以处理长时遮挡，离线方法依赖启发式拼接策略。

Method: 采用统一的图神经网络框架处理非重叠子片段，通过新颖的自回归长时跟踪层进行融合，子片段大小可调节延迟和时序上下文之间的权衡。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到最先进性能：DanceTrack上在线AssA提升+2.3，SportsMOT提升+9.2，MOT20提升+5.0，离线模式下提升更大。

Conclusion: NOOUGAT首次实现了任意时间跨度的多目标跟踪，为不同部署场景提供了统一的解决方案，在性能和灵活性方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: The long-standing division between \textit{online} and \textit{offline}
Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has led to fragmented solutions that fail to
address the flexible temporal requirements of real-world deployment scenarios.
Current \textit{online} trackers rely on frame-by-frame hand-crafted
association strategies and struggle with long-term occlusions, whereas
\textit{offline} approaches can cover larger time gaps, but still rely on
heuristic stitching for arbitrarily long sequences. In this paper, we introduce
NOOUGAT, the first tracker designed to operate with arbitrary temporal
horizons. NOOUGAT leverages a unified Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that
processes non-overlapping subclips, and fuses them through a novel
Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer. The subclip size controls the
trade-off between latency and temporal context, enabling a wide range of
deployment scenarios, from frame-by-frame to batch processing. NOOUGAT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both tracking regimes, improving
\textit{online} AssA by +2.3 on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, and +5.0 on
MOT20, with even greater gains in \textit{offline} mode.

Abstract: Hair artifacts in dermoscopic images present significant challenges for
accurate skin lesion analysis, potentially obscuring critical diagnostic
features in dermatological assessments. This work introduces a fine-tuned
SegFormer model augmented with dropout regularization to achieve precise hair
mask segmentation. The proposed SegformerWithDropout architecture leverages the
MiT-B2 encoder, pretrained on ImageNet, with an in-channel count of 3 and 2
output classes, incorporating a dropout probability of 0.3 in the segmentation
head to prevent overfitting. Training is conducted on a specialized dataset of
500 dermoscopic skin lesion images with fine-grained hair mask annotations,
employing 10-fold cross-validation, AdamW optimization with a learning rate of
0.001, and cross-entropy loss. Early stopping is applied based on validation
loss, with a patience of 3 epochs and a maximum of 20 epochs per fold.
Performance is evaluated using a comprehensive suite of metrics, including
Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice coefficient, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch
Similarity (LPIPS). Experimental results from the cross-validation demonstrate
robust performance, with average Dice coefficients reaching approximately 0.96
and IoU values of 0.93, alongside favorable PSNR (around 34 dB), SSIM (0.97),
and low LPIPS (0.06), highlighting the model's effectiveness in accurate hair
artifact segmentation and its potential to enhance preprocessing for downstream
skin cancer detection tasks.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) involves identifying various human
attributes from images with applications in intelligent monitoring systems. The
scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets hinders the generalization of PAR
models, specially in complex scenarios involving occlusions, varying poses, and
diverse environments. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promise
for generating diverse and realistic synthetic images, allowing to expand the
size and variability of training data. However, the potential of
diffusion-based data expansion for generating PAR-like images remains
underexplored. Such expansion may enhance the robustness and adaptability of
PAR models in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the effectiveness
of diffusion models in generating synthetic pedestrian images tailored to PAR
tasks. We identify key parameters of img2img diffusion-based data expansion;
including text prompts, image properties, and the latest enhancements in
diffusion-based data augmentation, and examine their impact on the quality of
generated images for PAR. Furthermore, we employ the best-performing expansion
approach to generate synthetic images for training PAR models, by enriching the
zero-shot datasets. Experimental results show that prompt alignment and image
properties are critical factors in image generation, with optimal selection
leading to a 4.5% improvement in PAR recognition performance.

Conclusion: 验证了GRPO的有效性，为全景场景理解建立了新的基准，推动了跨帧相关全景推理技术的发展

Abstract: Omnidirectional scene understanding is vital for various downstream
applications, such as embodied AI, autonomous driving, and immersive
environments, yet remains challenging due to geometric distortion and complex
spatial relations in 360{\deg} imagery. Existing omnidirectional methods
achieve scene understanding within a single frame while neglecting cross-frame
correlated panoramas. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{CFpano}, the
\textbf{first} benchmark dataset dedicated to cross-frame correlated panoramas
visual question answering in the holistic 360{\deg} scenes. CFpano consists of
over 2700 images together with over 8000 question-answer pairs, and the
question types include both multiple choice and open-ended VQA. Building upon
our CFpano, we further present \methodname, a multi-modal large language model
(MLLM) fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a set of
tailored reward functions for robust and consistent reasoning with cross-frame
correlated panoramas. Benchmark experiments with existing MLLMs are conducted
with our CFpano. The experimental results demonstrate that \methodname achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA
tasks, outperforming strong baselines on all major reasoning categories
(\textbf{+5.37\%} in overall performance). Our analyses validate the
effectiveness of GRPO and establish a new benchmark for panoramic scene
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于轨迹的新型测试时适应(TTA)数据集ITD，用于评估TTA方法在具有时间依赖性的真实场景中的表现，并提出了对抗性内存初始化策略来提升内存型TTA方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的TTA基准测试主要关注分布偏移和i.i.d.假设违反，但缺乏对真实世界中时间依赖性的模拟，如视频流中连续帧显示同一物体的场景。

Method: 从目标跟踪数据集的边界框中收集目标中心图像序列(轨迹)构建ITD数据集，并提出对抗性内存初始化策略来改进基于内存的TTA方法。

Result: ITD数据集能够有效评估TTA方法在时间依赖性挑战下的表现，新提出的对抗性内存初始化策略显著提升了多种方法在该基准上的性能。

Conclusion: ITD数据集填补了TTA评估中时间依赖性模拟的空白，提出的对抗性内存初始化策略为处理时序依赖的TTA方法提供了有效改进方向。

Abstract: We introduce a novel tracklet-based dataset for benchmarking test-time
adaptation (TTA) methods. The aim of this dataset is to mimic the intricate
challenges encountered in real-world environments such as images captured by
hand-held cameras, self-driving cars, etc. The current benchmarks for TTA focus
on how models face distribution shifts, when deployed, and on violations to the
customary independent-and-identically-distributed (i.i.d.) assumption in
machine learning. Yet, these benchmarks fail to faithfully represent realistic
scenarios that naturally display temporal dependencies, such as how consecutive
frames from a video stream likely show the same object across time. We address
this shortcoming of current datasets by proposing a novel TTA benchmark we call
the "Inherent Temporal Dependencies" (ITD) dataset. We ensure the instances in
ITD naturally embody temporal dependencies by collecting them from
tracklets-sequences of object-centric images we compile from the bounding boxes
of an object-tracking dataset. We use ITD to conduct a thorough experimental
analysis of current TTA methods, and shed light on the limitations of these
methods when faced with the challenges of temporal dependencies. Moreover, we
build upon these insights and propose a novel adversarial memory initialization
strategy to improve memory-based TTA methods. We find this strategy
substantially boosts the performance of various methods on our challenging
benchmark.

Conclusion: DSGC-Net通过双流图卷积网络有效解决了人群计数中的密度变化适应和表示一致性问题，显著提升了计数精度，特别是在多视角和多姿态场景中。

Abstract: Deep learning-based crowd counting methods have achieved remarkable progress
in recent years. However, in complex crowd scenarios, existing models still
face challenges when adapting to significant density distribution differences
between regions. Additionally, the inconsistency of individual representations
caused by viewpoint changes and body posture differences further limits the
counting accuracy of the models. To address these challenges, we propose
DSGC-Net, a Dual-Stream Graph Convolutional Network based on feature
correlation mining. DSGC-Net introduces a Density Approximation (DA) branch and
a Representation Approximation (RA) branch. By modeling two semantic graphs, it
captures the potential feature correlations in density variations and
representation distributions. The DA branch incorporates a density prediction
module that generates the density distribution map, and constructs a
density-driven semantic graph based on density similarity. The RA branch
establishes a representation-driven semantic graph by computing global
representation similarity. Then, graph convolutional networks are applied to
the two semantic graphs separately to model the latent semantic relationships,
which enhance the model's ability to adapt to density variations and improve
counting accuracy in multi-view and multi-pose scenarios. Extensive experiments
on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DSGC-Net outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods. In particular, we achieve MAE of 48.9 and 5.9 in
ShanghaiTech Part A and Part B datasets, respectively. The released code is
available at: https://github.com/Wu-eon/CrowdCounting-DSGCNet.

Conclusion: 空间语义集成对于遥感图像OOD检测具有关键价值，该框架为遥感应用中的可靠异常模式识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection represents a critical challenge in remote
sensing applications, where reliable identification of novel or anomalous
patterns is essential for autonomous monitoring, disaster response, and
environmental assessment. Despite remarkable progress in OOD detection for
natural images, existing methods and benchmarks remain poorly suited to remote
sensing imagery due to data scarcity, complex multi-scale scene structures, and
pronounced distribution shifts. To this end, we propose RS-OOD, a novel
framework that leverages remote sensing-specific vision-language modeling to
enable robust few-shot OOD detection. Our approach introduces three key
innovations: spatial feature enhancement that improved scene discrimination, a
dual-prompt alignment mechanism that cross-verifies scene context against
fine-grained semantics for spatial-semantic consistency, and a
confidence-guided self-training loop that dynamically mines pseudo-labels to
expand training data without manual annotation. RS-OOD consistently outperforms
existing methods across multiple remote sensing benchmarks and enables
efficient adaptation with minimal labeled data, demonstrating the critical
value of spatial-semantic integration.

Abstract: Unstructured urban environments present unique challenges for scene
understanding and generalization due to their complex and diverse layouts. We
introduce SynthGenNet, a self-supervised student-teacher architecture designed
to enable robust test-time domain generalization using synthetic multi-source
imagery. Our contributions include the novel ClassMix++ algorithm, which blends
labeled data from various synthetic sources while maintaining semantic
integrity, enhancing model adaptability. We further employ Grounded Mask
Consistency Loss (GMC), which leverages source ground truth to improve
cross-domain prediction consistency and feature alignment. The Pseudo-Label
Guided Contrastive Learning (PLGCL) mechanism is integrated into the student
network to facilitate domain-invariant feature learning through iterative
knowledge distillation from the teacher network. This self-supervised strategy
improves prediction accuracy, addresses real-world variability, bridges the
sim-to-real domain gap, and reliance on labeled target data, even in complex
urban areas. Outcomes show our model outperforms the state-of-the-art (relying
on single source) by achieving 50% Mean Intersection-Over-Union (mIoU) value on

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate stunning visuals, yet they often
fail at tasks children find trivial--like placing a dog to the right of a teddy
bear rather than to the left. When combinations get more unusual--a giraffe
above an airplane--these failures become even more pronounced. Existing methods
attempt to fix these spatial reasoning failures through model fine-tuning or
test-time optimization with handcrafted losses that are suboptimal. Rather than
imposing our assumptions about spatial encoding, we propose learning these
objectives directly from the model's internal representations. We introduce
Learn-to-Steer, a novel framework that learns data-driven objectives for
test-time optimization rather than handcrafting them. Our key insight is to
train a lightweight classifier that decodes spatial relationships from the
diffusion model's cross-attention maps, then deploy this classifier as a
learned loss function during inference. Training such classifiers poses a
surprising challenge: they can take shortcuts by detecting linguistic traces
rather than learning true spatial patterns. We solve this with a dual-inversion
strategy that enforces geometric understanding. Our method dramatically
improves spatial accuracy: from 0.20 to 0.61 on FLUX.1-dev and from 0.07 to
0.54 on SD2.1 across standard benchmarks. Moreover, our approach generalizes to
multiple relations and significantly improves accuracy.

Abstract: Playing games is inherently human, and a lot of games are created to
challenge different human characteristics. However, these tasks are often left
out when evaluating the human-like nature of artificial models. The objective
of this work is proposing a new approach to evaluate artificial models via
board games. To this effect, we test the color perception and color naming
capabilities of CLIP by playing the board game Hues & Cues and assess its
alignment with humans. Our experiments show that CLIP is generally well aligned
with human observers, but our approach brings to light certain cultural biases
and inconsistencies when dealing with different abstraction levels that are
hard to identify with other testing strategies. Our findings indicate that
assessing models with different tasks like board games can make certain
deficiencies in the models stand out in ways that are difficult to test with

TL;DR: 提出了OmniActor通用智能体，通过分层混合专家模型解决GUI和实体环境数据冲突，实现跨2D虚拟和3D真实世界的任务执行


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能体研究主要关注GUI或实体环境，但复杂任务需要在这两种环境中交替交互。混合训练时发现数据冲突导致性能下降，需要解决这种冲突并利用协同效应

Method: 提出分层异构MoE架构：浅层参数共享以利用协同效应，深层参数分离以消除冲突；统一GUI和实体任务的动作空间；收集大规模多源数据进行训练

Result: OmniActor在GUI和实体任务上都优于仅使用单一数据类型训练的智能体，特别是在GUI任务上表现显著提升

Conclusion: 通过脑科学启发的分层架构设计，成功解决了多模态智能体在跨环境任务中的数据冲突问题，为通用智能体发展提供了有效方案

Abstract: Multimodal large language models are evolving toward multimodal agents
capable of proactively executing tasks. Most agent research focuses on GUI or
embodied scenarios, which correspond to agents interacting with 2D virtual
worlds or 3D real worlds, respectively. However, many complex tasks typically
require agents to interleavely interact with these two types of environment. We
initially mix GUI and embodied data to train, but find the performance
degeneration brought by the data conflict. Further analysis reveals that GUI
and embodied data exhibit synergy and conflict at the shallow and deep layers,
respectively, which resembles the cerebrum-cerebellum mechanism in the human
brain. To this end, we propose a high-performance generalist agent OmniActor,
designed from both structural and data perspectives. First, we propose
Layer-heterogeneity MoE to eliminate the conflict between GUI and embodied data
by separating deep-layer parameters, while leverage their synergy by sharing
shallow-layer parameters. By successfully leveraging the synergy and
eliminating the conflict, OmniActor outperforms agents only trained by GUI or
embodied data in GUI or embodied tasks. Furthermore, we unify the action spaces
of GUI and embodied tasks, and collect large-scale GUI and embodied data from
various sources for training. This significantly improves OmniActor under
different scenarios, especially in GUI tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

*Alireza Sedighi Moghaddam,Mohammad Reza Mohammadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ORDAC方法，通过标签分布学习自适应校正序数分类中的噪声标签，在年龄估计和疾病严重程度检测任务上显著提升模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 序数图像分类中标签边界模糊，标注过程容易产生噪声，这种标签噪声会显著降低机器学习模型的性能和可靠性

Method: 提出ORDAC方法，利用标签分布学习(LDL)建模序数标签的模糊性和不确定性，在训练过程中动态调整每个样本标签分布的均值和标准差，校正而非丢弃噪声样本

Result: 在Adience数据集上，40%噪声情况下ORDAC_R将平均绝对误差从0.86降至0.62，召回率从0.37提升至0.49，在原始数据集的内在噪声校正中也表现有效

Conclusion: 使用标签分布进行自适应标签校正是提高序数分类模型在噪声数据下鲁棒性和准确性的有效策略

Abstract: Labeled data is a fundamental component in training supervised deep learning
models for computer vision tasks. However, the labeling process, especially for
ordinal image classification where class boundaries are often ambiguous, is
prone to error and noise. Such label noise can significantly degrade the
performance and reliability of machine learning models. This paper addresses
the problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image
classification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal
Adaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy
labels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution
Learning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in
ordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and
standard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than
discarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and
make optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience)
and disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric
Gaussian noise scenarios. Results show that ORDAC and its extended versions
(ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R) lead to significant improvements in model performance.
For instance, on the Adience dataset with 40% noise, ORDAC_R reduced the mean
absolute error from 0.86 to 0.62 and increased the recall metric from 0.37 to
0.49. The method also demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting intrinsic
noise present in the original datasets. This research indicates that adaptive
label correction using label distributions is an effective strategy to enhance
the robustness and accuracy of ordinal classification models in the presence of
noisy data.

TL;DR: 本文提出C33D方法，通过组合现有3D模型和文本描述来生成新的3D模型，解决了多源内容融合中的纹理不一致和形状不准问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的文本/图像/3D到3D方法在融合多个内容源时效果不佳，导致纹理不一致和形状不准。需要一种能够有效组合不同对象类别来创建新颖3D模型的方法。

Method: 提出C33D方法：1)从输入3D模型渲染多视角图像和法线图；2)使用适配性文本-图像协调(ATIH)生成新的2D对象；3)通过纹理多视角扩散保证纹理一致性；4)通过形状多视角扩散提高形状准确性；5)重建完整的新颖3D模型。

Conclusion: C33D方法通过多视角扩散技术有效解决了3D对象合成任务中的纹理不一致和形状不准问题，能够生成结构协调的新颖3D模型。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle a new task of 3D object synthesis, where a 3D model
is composited with another object category to create a novel 3D model. However,
most existing text/image/3D-to-3D methods struggle to effectively integrate
multiple content sources, often resulting in inconsistent textures and
inaccurate shapes. To overcome these challenges, we propose a straightforward
yet powerful approach, category+3D-to-3D (C33D), for generating novel and
structurally coherent 3D models. Our method begins by rendering multi-view
images and normal maps from the input 3D model, then generating a novel 2D
object using adaptive text-image harmony (ATIH) with the front-view image and a
text description from another object category as inputs. To ensure texture
consistency, we introduce texture multi-view diffusion, which refines the
textures of the remaining multi-view RGB images based on the novel 2D object.
For enhanced shape accuracy, we propose shape multi-view diffusion to improve
the 2D shapes of both the multi-view RGB images and the normal maps, also
conditioned on the novel 2D object. Finally, these outputs are used to
reconstruct a complete and novel 3D model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method, yielding impressive 3D creations, such as
shark(3D)-crocodile(text) in the first row of Fig. 1. A project page is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了多模态大语言模型在空间理解方面的局限性，提出了MulSeT基准测试，从数据和架构两个角度评估了三种场景下的空间推理能力，发现仅靠增加训练数据无法显著提升性能，空间理解更依赖于视觉编码器中的位置编码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明多模态大语言模型在空间理解方面存在困难，但缺乏全面系统的评估。本研究旨在填补这一空白，从数据和架构角度系统分析MLLMs的空间理解能力。

Method: 提出了MulSeT基准测试，设计了一系列实验来分析MLLMs的空间推理能力。从数据角度分析训练数据量对性能的影响，从架构角度分析位置编码的重要性，并探索推理注入方法。

Result: 发现空间理解性能随训练数据增加快速收敛，上限相对较低，特别是需要空间想象的任务。空间理解更依赖于视觉编码器中的位置编码，而不是语言模型中的位置编码。

Conclusion: 仅扩展训练数据不足以实现满意的空间理解性能，需要通过架构设计优化空间理解能力，为改进空间推理能力提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Spatial understanding is essential for Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to support perception, reasoning, and planning in embodied
environments. Despite recent progress, existing studies reveal that MLLMs still
struggle with spatial understanding. However, existing research lacks a
comprehensive and systematic evaluation of these limitations, often restricted
to isolated scenarios, such as single-view or video. In this work, we present a
systematic analysis of spatial understanding from both data and architectural
perspectives across three representative scenarios: single-view, multi-view,
and video. We propose a benchmark named MulSeT (Multi-view Spatial
Understanding Tasks), and design a series of experiments to analyze the spatial
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. From the data perspective, the performance of
spatial understanding converges quickly as the training data increases, and the
upper bound is relatively low, especially for tasks that require spatial
imagination. This indicates that merely expanding training data is insufficient
to achieve satisfactory performance. From the architectural perspective, we
find that spatial understanding relies more heavily on the positional encoding
within the visual encoder than within the language model, in both cascaded and
native MLLMs. Moreover, we explore reasoning injection and envision future
improvements through architectural design to optimize spatial understanding.
These insights shed light on the limitations of current MLLMs and suggest new
directions for improving spatial reasoning capabilities through data scaling
and architectural tuning.

TL;DR: MedDINOv3是一个简单有效的框架，通过多尺度token聚合和领域自适应预训练，将DINOv3视觉基础模型成功适配到医学图像分割任务中，在多个基准测试中达到或超越最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学CT和MRI扫描中器官和肿瘤的精确分割对诊断和治疗至关重要，但现有深度学习模型缺乏跨模态和跨机构的泛化能力。视觉基础模型虽然提供强大可迁移表示，但在医学图像分割中仍面临ViT骨干网络性能不足和自然图像与医学图像领域差距大的挑战。

Method: 首先重新设计简单有效的多尺度token聚合架构，然后在包含387万张轴向CT切片的CT-3M数据集上进行多阶段DINOv3领域自适应预训练，学习鲁棒的密集特征表示。

Result: MedDINOv3在四个分割基准测试中匹配或超越了最先进的性能，证明了视觉基础模型作为医学图像分割统一骨干网络的潜力。

Conclusion: 该研究成功展示了如何有效适配视觉基础模型到医学图像分割领域，为构建通用医学图像分析模型提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of organs and tumors in CT and MRI scans is essential
for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. While deep learning
has advanced automated segmentation, most models remain task-specific, lacking
generalizability across modalities and institutions. Vision foundation models
(FMs) pretrained on billion-scale natural images offer powerful and
transferable representations. However, adapting them to medical imaging faces
two key challenges: (1) the ViT backbone of most foundation models still
underperform specialized CNNs on medical image segmentation, and (2) the large
domain gap between natural and medical images limits transferability. We
introduce \textbf{MedDINOv3}, a simple and effective framework for adapting
DINOv3 to medical segmentation. We first revisit plain ViTs and design a simple
and effective architecture with multi-scale token aggregation. Then, we perform
domain-adaptive pretraining on \textbf{CT-3M}, a curated collection of 3.87M
axial CT slices, using a multi-stage DINOv3 recipe to learn robust dense
features. MedDINOv3 matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across four
segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of vision foundation
models as unified backbones for medical image segmentation. The code is

Motivation: 现有高性能实时立体匹配方法依赖3D成本体积正则化，这对移动设备不友好；而基于2D正则化的方法在不适定区域表现不佳。

Method: 提出轻量级双向几何聚合块，分别捕获空间和视差表示，通过解耦4D成本体积的特性来实现纯2D卷积的4D成本聚合。

Result: 在推理时间和准确度方面均优于所有现有基于聚合的方法，甚至超越了基于迭代的方法IGEV-Stereo。

Conclusion: 打破了使用3D卷积处理4D成本体积的经验设计，为解耦聚合范式提供了一个简单而强大的基线。

Abstract: High-performance real-time stereo matching methods invariably rely on 3D
regularization of the cost volume, which is unfriendly to mobile devices. And
2D regularization based methods struggle in ill-posed regions. In this paper,
we present a deployment-friendly 4D cost aggregation network DBStereo, which is
based on pure 2D convolutions. Specifically, we first provide a thorough
analysis of the decoupling characteristics of 4D cost volume. And design a
lightweight bidirectional geometry aggregation block to capture spatial and
disparity representation respectively. Through decoupled learning, our approach
achieves real-time performance and impressive accuracy simultaneously.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DBStereo outperforms all
existing aggregation-based methods in both inference time and accuracy, even
surpassing the iterative-based method IGEV-Stereo. Our study break the
empirical design of using 3D convolutions for 4D cost volume and provides a
simple yet strong baseline of the proposed decouple aggregation paradigm for
further study. Code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割依赖大规模高质量标注，但专家标注存在主观性和粗糙标注等噪声问题，影响模型性能

Method: 几何距离感知模块动态调整像素级权重，结构引导标签精炼模块利用结构先验优化标签，知识迁移模块增强监督和对局部细节的敏感性

Result: 在6个公开数据集上验证，在噪声标注下达到最先进性能，在Kvasir、Shenzhen、BU-SUC和BraTS2020数据集上分别提升2.52%、22.76%、8.87%和4.59%

Conclusion: GSD-Net能有效处理医学图像分割中的标注噪声问题，提高模型在真实世界标注不一致情况下的性能

Abstract: The effectiveness of convolutional neural networks in medical image
segmentation relies on large-scale, high-quality annotations, which are costly
and time-consuming to obtain. Even expert-labeled datasets inevitably contain
noise arising from subjectivity and coarse delineations, which disrupt feature
learning and adversely impact model performance. To address these challenges,
this study propose a Geometric-Structural Dual-Guided Network (GSD-Net), which
integrates geometric and structural cues to improve robustness against noisy
annotations. It incorporates a Geometric Distance-Aware module that dynamically
adjusts pixel-level weights using geometric features, thereby strengthening
supervision in reliable regions while suppressing noise. A Structure-Guided
Label Refinement module further refines labels with structural priors, and a
Knowledge Transfer module enriches supervision and improves sensitivity to
local details. To comprehensively assess its effectiveness, we evaluated
GSD-Net on six publicly available datasets: four containing three types of
simulated label noise, and two with multi-expert annotations that reflect
real-world subjectivity and labeling inconsistencies. Experimental results
demonstrate that GSD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance under noisy
annotations, achieving improvements of 2.52% on Kvasir, 22.76% on Shenzhen,
8.87% on BU-SUC, and 4.59% on BraTS2020 under SR simulated noise. The codes of
this study are available at https://github.com/ortonwang/GSD-Net.

Motivation: 解决现有红外与可见光图像融合方法在轻量级模型上难以实现高质量融合的挑战，需要结合不同模态的互补信息来增强场景感知能力

Method: 采用协作蒸馏和自学习框架，利用强化学习智能体探索适合学生的训练策略。智能体根据学生性能和师生差距生成挑战性样本，并动态调整教师指导强度来优化知识迁移

Conclusion: 该框架通过强化学习驱动的协作蒸馏和自学习机制，有效解决了轻量级模型在图像融合任务中的性能瓶颈问题，为多模态图像融合提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion plays a critical role in enhancing scene
perception by combining complementary information from different modalities.
Despite recent advances, achieving high-quality image fusion with lightweight
models remains a significant challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
collaborative distillation and self-learning framework for image fusion driven
by reinforcement learning. Unlike conventional distillation, this approach not
only enables the student model to absorb image fusion knowledge from the
teacher model, but more importantly, allows the student to perform
self-learning on more challenging samples to enhance its capabilities.
Particularly, in our framework, a reinforcement learning agent explores and
identifies a more suitable training strategy for the student.The agent takes
both the student's performance and the teacher-student gap as inputs, which
leads to the generation of challenging samples to facilitate the student's
self-learning. Simultaneously, it dynamically adjusts the teacher's guidance
strength based on the student's state to optimize the knowledge transfer.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly improve
student performance and achieve better fusion results compared to existing
techniques.

Motivation: 现有美妆转移方法存在身份偏移、公平性问题，且缺乏实时能力和时序一致性，限制了实际应用。需要解决半透明美妆与皮肤色调的解耦问题。

Method: 将美妆转移解耦为两步：透明美妆面具提取和图形学渲染。使用伪真实数据训练提取模型，包括图形渲染流程和无监督k-means聚类方法。提出专门的训练目标：alpha权重重建捐失和唇彩颜色捐失。

Result: 方法在多样化姿态、表情和皮肤色调上实现了稳健的美妆转移，保持时序平滑性。实验结果显示该方法在抓取细节、维持时序稳定性和保持身份完整性方面超过现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过创新的两步解耦策略和专门的训练目标，成功解决了实时虚拟化妆试用中的关键挑战，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for real-time virtual makeup try-on that
achieves high-fidelity, identity-preserving cosmetic transfer with robust
temporal consistency. In live makeup transfer applications, it is critical to
synthesize temporally coherent results that accurately replicate fine-grained
makeup and preserve user's identity. However, existing methods often struggle
to disentangle semitransparent cosmetics from skin tones and other identify
features, causing identity shifts and raising fairness concerns. Furthermore,
current methods lack real-time capabilities and fail to maintain temporal
consistency, limiting practical adoption. To address these challenges, we
decouple makeup transfer into two steps: transparent makeup mask extraction and
graphics-based mask rendering. After the makeup extraction step, the makeup
rendering can be performed in real time, enabling live makeup try-on. Our
makeup extraction model trained on pseudo-ground-truth data generated via two
complementary methods: a graphics-based rendering pipeline and an unsupervised
k-means clustering approach. To further enhance transparency estimation and
color fidelity, we propose specialized training objectives, including
alpha-weighted reconstruction and lip color losses. Our method achieves robust
makeup transfer across diverse poses, expressions, and skin tones while
preserving temporal smoothness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms existing baselines in capturing fine details, maintaining
temporal stability, and preserving identity integrity.

Conclusion: RiverScope为精细尺度和多传感器水文建模提供了宝贵资源，支持气候适应和可持续水资源管理，填补了高分辨率河流监测数据的空白。

Abstract: Surface water dynamics play a critical role in Earth's climate system,
influencing ecosystems, agriculture, disaster resilience, and sustainable
development. Yet monitoring rivers and surface water at fine spatial and
temporal scales remains challenging -- especially for narrow or sediment-rich
rivers that are poorly captured by low-resolution satellite data. To address
this, we introduce RiverScope, a high-resolution dataset developed through
collaboration between computer science and hydrology experts. RiverScope
comprises 1,145 high-resolution images (covering 2,577 square kilometers) with
expert-labeled river and surface water masks, requiring over 100 hours of
manual annotation. Each image is co-registered with Sentinel-2, SWOT, and the
SWOT River Database (SWORD), enabling the evaluation of cost-accuracy
trade-offs across sensors -- a key consideration for operational water
monitoring. We also establish the first global, high-resolution benchmark for
river width estimation, achieving a median error of 7.2 meters -- significantly
outperforming existing satellite-derived methods. We extensively evaluate deep
networks across multiple architectures (e.g., CNNs and transformers),
pretraining strategies (e.g., supervised and self-supervised), and training
datasets (e.g., ImageNet and satellite imagery). Our best-performing models
combine the benefits of transfer learning with the use of all the multispectral
PlanetScope channels via learned adaptors. RiverScope provides a valuable
resource for fine-scale and multi-sensor hydrological modeling, supporting
climate adaptation and sustainable water management.

Abstract: Video compositing combines live-action footage to create video production,
serving as a crucial technique in video creation and film production.
Traditional pipelines require intensive labor efforts and expert collaboration,
resulting in lengthy production cycles and high manpower costs. To address this
issue, we automate this process with generative models, called generative video
compositing. This new task strives to adaptively inject identity and motion
information of foreground video to the target video in an interactive manner,
allowing users to customize the size, motion trajectory, and other attributes
of the dynamic elements added in final video. Specifically, we designed a novel
Diffusion Transformer (DiT) pipeline based on its intrinsic properties. To
maintain consistency of the target video before and after editing, we revised a
light-weight DiT-based background preservation branch with masked token
injection. As to inherit dynamic elements from other sources, a DiT fusion
block is proposed using full self-attention, along with a simple yet effective
foreground augmentation for training. Besides, for fusing background and
foreground videos with different layouts based on user control, we developed a
novel position embedding, named Extended Rotary Position Embedding (ERoPE).
Finally, we curated a dataset comprising 61K sets of videos for our new task,
called VideoComp. This data includes complete dynamic elements and high-quality
target videos. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively realizes
generative video compositing, outperforming existing possible solutions in
fidelity and consistency.

Abstract: In this paper, we rethink text-to-avatar generative models by proposing TeRA,
a more efficient and effective framework than the previous SDS-based models and
general large 3D generative models. Our approach employs a two-stage training
strategy for learning a native 3D avatar generative model. Initially, we
distill a decoder to derive a structured latent space from a large human
reconstruction model. Subsequently, a text-controlled latent diffusion model is
trained to generate photorealistic 3D human avatars within this latent space.
TeRA enhances the model performance by eliminating slow iterative optimization
and enables text-based partial customization through a structured 3D human
representation. Experiments have proven our approach's superiority over
previous text-to-avatar generative models in subjective and objective
evaluation.

Abstract: The adoption of Transformer-based architectures in the medical domain is
growing rapidly. In medical imaging, the analysis of complex shapes - such as
organs, tissues, or other anatomical structures - combined with the often
anisotropic nature of high-dimensional images complicates these adaptations. In
this study, we critically examine the role of Positional Encodings (PEs),
arguing that commonly used approaches may be suboptimal for the specific
challenges of medical imaging. Sinusoidal Positional Encodings (SPEs) have
proven effective in vision tasks, but they struggle to preserve Euclidean
distances in higher-dimensional spaces. Isotropic Fourier Feature Positional
Encodings (IFPEs) have been proposed to better preserve Euclidean distances,
but they lack the ability to account for anisotropy in images. To address these
limitations, we propose Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE),
a generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and
domain-specific spatial dependencies. We systematically benchmark AFPE against
commonly used PEs on multi-label classification in chest X-rays, organ
classification in CT images, and ejection fraction regression in
echocardiography. Our results demonstrate that choosing the correct PE can
significantly improve model performance. We show that the optimal PE depends on
the shape of the structure of interest and the anisotropy of the data. Finally,
our proposed AFPE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PEs in all tested
anisotropic settings. We conclude that, in anisotropic medical images and
videos, it is of paramount importance to choose an anisotropic PE that fits the
data and the shape of interest.

Conclusion: 该方法为健身活动识别提供了可扩展且具备实时能力的解决方案，在基于视觉的健康和活动监测中具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Fitness movement recognition, a focused subdomain of human activity
recognition (HAR), plays a vital role in health monitoring, rehabilitation, and
personalized fitness training by enabling automated exercise classification
from video data. However, many existing deep learning approaches rely on
computationally intensive 3D models, limiting their feasibility in real-time or
resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we present a lightweight and
effective framework that integrates pre-trained 2D Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet50, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformers (ViT)
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network enhanced by spatial attention.
These models efficiently extract spatial features while the LSTM captures
temporal dependencies, and the attention mechanism emphasizes informative
segments. We evaluate the framework on a curated subset of the UCF101 dataset,
achieving a peak accuracy of 93.34\% with the ResNet50-based configuration.
Comparative results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several
state-of-the-art HAR systems. The proposed method offers a scalable and
real-time-capable solution for fitness activity recognition with broader
applications in vision-based health and activity monitoring.

TL;DR: 提出MDM-MixMFL框架，通过模态解耦策略和模态记忆机制解决分布式混合模态MRI图像分割中的异构性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MRI图像分割方法主要采用集中式多模态范式，不适用于工程中非集中式混合模态医疗场景，存在客户端模态异构性和数据异构性问题

Method: 模态解耦策略将每个模态分解为模态特定和模态共享信息，模态记忆机制动态存储客户端共享模态原型以补偿局部客户端的不完整模态

Result: 在两个公共MRI图像分割数据集上的大量实验证明了方法的有效性和优越性

Conclusion: 提出的MDM-MixMFL框架能够有效处理混合模态联邦学习中的异构性问题，为分布式医疗场景下的MRI图像分割提供了新解决方案

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image segmentation is crucial in diagnosing
and treating many diseases, such as brain tumors. Existing MRI image
segmentation methods mainly fall into a centralized multimodal paradigm, which
is inapplicable in engineering non-centralized mix-modal medical scenarios. In
this situation, each distributed client (hospital) processes multiple mixed MRI
modalities, and the modality set and image data for each client are diverse,
suffering from extensive client-wise modality heterogeneity and data
heterogeneity. In this paper, we first formulate non-centralized mix-modal MRI
image segmentation as a new paradigm for federated learning (FL) that involves
multiple modalities, called mix-modal federated learning (MixMFL). It
distinguishes from existing multimodal federating learning (MulMFL) and
cross-modal federating learning (CroMFL) paradigms. Then, we proposed a novel
modality decoupling and memorizing mix-modal federated learning framework
(MDM-MixMFL) for MRI image segmentation, which is characterized by a modality
decoupling strategy and a modality memorizing mechanism. Specifically, the
modality decoupling strategy disentangles each modality into modality-tailored
and modality-shared information. During mix-modal federated updating,
corresponding modality encoders undergo tailored and shared updating,
respectively. It facilitates stable and adaptive federating aggregation of
heterogeneous data and modalities from distributed clients. Besides, the
modality memorizing mechanism stores client-shared modality prototypes
dynamically refreshed from every modality-tailored encoder to compensate for
incomplete modalities in each local client. It further benefits modality
aggregation and fusion processes during mixmodal federated learning. Extensive
experiments on two public datasets for MRI image segmentation demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our methods.

TL;DR: MR-DINOSAUR是一个完全无监督的多目标发现方法，通过运动分割生成高质量伪标签来改进DINOSAUR模型，无需人工监督即可在视频中检测和定位多个对象


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无监督多目标发现方法虽然利用视频运动线索，但仍需要监督生成伪标签来训练对象中心学习模型，这限制了真正的无监督学习能力

Method: 扩展自监督预训练模型DINOSAUR，通过检索无相机运动的视频帧进行无监督光流运动分割来生成高质量伪标签，使用这些标签精炼slot表示并训练slot停用模块来区分前景和背景

Result: 在TRI-PD和KITTI数据集上取得了强大的多目标发现结果，性能优于之前的state-of-the-art方法，尽管是完全无监督的

Conclusion: MR-DINOSAUR通过概念简单但有效的方法证明了完全无监督多目标发现的可行性，运动精炼策略显著提升了无监督学习性能

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-object discovery (MOD) aims to detect and localize
distinct object instances in visual scenes without any form of human
supervision. Recent approaches leverage object-centric learning (OCL) and
motion cues from video to identify individual objects. However, these
approaches use supervision to generate pseudo labels to train the OCL model. We
address this limitation with MR-DINOSAUR -- Motion-Refined DINOSAUR -- a
minimalistic unsupervised approach that extends the self-supervised pre-trained
OCL model, DINOSAUR, to the task of unsupervised multi-object discovery. We
generate high-quality unsupervised pseudo labels by retrieving video frames
without camera motion for which we perform motion segmentation of unsupervised
optical flow. We refine DINOSAUR's slot representations using these pseudo
labels and train a slot deactivation module to assign slots to foreground and
background. Despite its conceptual simplicity, MR-DINOSAUR achieves strong
multi-object discovery results on the TRI-PD and KITTI datasets, outperforming
the previous state of the art despite being fully unsupervised.

Motivation: 现有的3D视觉基础模型在处理长序列图像输入时存在推理效率低下的问题，VGGT模型存在token崩溃现象和计算瓶颈

Method: 提出FastVGGT，首次在3D领域利用token合并技术，设计了针对3D架构和任务的独特token分区策略，通过训练无关机制加速VGGT

Result: 在多个3D几何基准测试中验证有效性，1000张输入图像下实现4倍加速，同时减轻长序列场景中的误差累积

Conclusion: token合并技术为可扩展的3D视觉系统提供了有前景的解决方案，在保持性能的同时显著提升效率

Abstract: Foundation models for 3D vision have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in 3D perception. However, scaling these models to long-sequence
image inputs remains a significant challenge due to inference-time
inefficiency. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of VGGT, a
state-of-the-art feed-forward visual geometry model and identify its primary
bottleneck. Visualization further reveals a token collapse phenomenon in the
attention maps. Motivated by these findings, we explore the potential of token
merging in the feed-forward visual geometry model. Owing to the unique
architectural and task-specific properties of 3D models, directly applying
existing merging techniques proves challenging. To this end, we propose
FastVGGT, which, for the first time, leverages token merging in the 3D domain
through a training-free mechanism for accelerating VGGT. we devise a unique
token partitioning strategy tailored to 3D architectures and tasks, effectively
eliminating redundant computation while preserving VGGT's powerful
reconstruction capacity. Extensive experiments on multiple 3D geometry
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, with 1000 input
images, FastVGGT achieves a 4x speedup over VGGT while mitigating error
accumulation in long-sequence scenarios. These findings underscore the
potential of token merging as a principled solution for scalable 3D vision
systems. Code is available at: https://mystorm16.github.io/fastvggt/.

Motivation: 虽然口吃检测模型的性能不断提升，但临床应用需要模型具有可控制性和可解释性，因此需要系统性评估各种方法的临床适用性。

Method: 采用系统性对比分析方法，在多个数据集上进行综合性能评似，并统计专业临床医生的评估意见，从性能、可控制性和可解释性三个维度评估四种代表性方法。

Result: YOLO-Stutter和FluentNet效率高但透明度有限；UDM在准确性和临床解释性方面达到最佳平衡；SSDM虽有潜力但无法完全复现。研究识别了各方法之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 研究强调了临床可用性的重要性，指出了口吃模型未来的发展方向，并为每种方法提供了详细的实现见解和实际部署考虑。

Abstract: Recent advances in dysfluency detection have introduced a variety of modeling
paradigms, ranging from lightweight object-detection inspired networks
(YOLOStutter) to modular interpretable frameworks (UDM). While performance on
benchmark datasets continues to improve, clinical adoption requires more than
accuracy: models must be controllable and explainable. In this paper, we
present a systematic comparative analysis of four representative
approaches--YOLO-Stutter, FluentNet, UDM, and SSDM--along three dimensions:
performance, controllability, and explainability. Through comprehensive
evaluation on multiple datasets and expert clinician assessment, we find that
YOLO-Stutter and FluentNet provide efficiency and simplicity, but with limited
transparency; UDM achieves the best balance of accuracy and clinical
interpretability; and SSDM, while promising, could not be fully reproduced in
our experiments. Our analysis highlights the trade-offs among competing
approaches and identifies future directions for clinically viable dysfluency
modeling. We also provide detailed implementation insights and practical
deployment considerations for each approach.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型能力评估中的数据污染问题，确保指标测量真实的推理能力而非单纯记忆。

Method: 使用无限扩展框架从arXiv论文合成研究级QA问题，利用论文发布的时间结构进行纵向分析，评估4个前沿模型在1,643个多步推理问题上的表现。

Result: 在各种规模、开发商和发布时间的模型中，知识切断点附近均未观察到显著的性能降低。

Conclusion: 多步推理合成方法能够提供更深层次的复杂性，有效减缓数据污染影响，建议优先采用推理驱动的合成方法构建指标。

Abstract: Capability evaluation of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
shadowed by rising concerns of data contamination that cast doubts on whether
static benchmarks measure genuine reasoning or mere memorization. We present an
empirical study using an infinitely scalable framework to synthesize
research-level QA directly from arXiv papers, harnessing the natural temporal
structure of research publications where performance decay after knowledge
cutoffs may indicate potential contamination. We evaluated 4 frontier model
represented by 2 models of different knowledge cutoff dates per family on 1,643
multi-step reasoning questions synthesized from 20,277 arXiv papers stratified
over 26 months, covering at least 6 months before and after all cutoff dates.
Our results consistently showed a lack of significant performance decay near
knowledge cutoff dates for models of various sizes, developers, and release
dates. We further performed a comparative analysis with previous longitudinal
studies that reported significant post-cutoff performance decay using directly
retrieved questions based on public data. we hypothesize that the multi-step
reasoning required by our synthesis pipeline offered additional complexity that
goes deeper than shallow memorization, which effectively serves a mitigation
strategy against benchmark contamination. We fully open source our code and
dataset to aid reproducibility and advocate for a paradigm shift that
prioritize reasoning-driven synthesis to construct benchmarks over simply
collecting newly released questions periodically.

Motivation: 人类能够结合他人语言指导与直接经验进行安全快速学习，研究旨在探索如何让AI系统也具备这种社会学习能力，实现人机协作学习。

Method: 建立概率推理框架，将预训练语言模型转化为条件概率模型，通过贝叶斯推理处理感觉运动数据和语言输入，在10个视频游戏中进行行为实验和模拟。

Conclusion: 结构化、语言兼容的表征能够实现人机协作学习，为构建能够整合语言指导与直接经验的AI系统提供了计算框架。

Abstract: The ability to combine linguistic guidance from others with direct experience
is central to human development, enabling safe and rapid learning in new
environments. How do people integrate these two sources of knowledge, and how
might AI systems? We present a computational framework that models social
learning as joint probabilistic inference over structured, executable world
models given sensorimotor and linguistic data. We make this possible by turning
a pretrained language model into a probabilistic model of how humans share
advice conditioned on their beliefs, allowing our agents both to generate
advice for others and to interpret linguistic input as evidence during Bayesian
inference. Using behavioral experiments and simulations across 10 video games,
we show how linguistic guidance can shape exploration and accelerate learning
by reducing risky interactions and speeding up key discoveries in both humans
and models. We further explore how knowledge can accumulate across generations
through iterated learning experiments and demonstrate successful knowledge
transfer between humans and models -- revealing how structured,
language-compatible representations might enable human-machine collaborative
learning.

Motivation: 解决推理模型成本高、延迟大的问题，寻找一种在单次推理和谱贵推理链之间的平衡方案

Method: 通过切字等级的不确定性测量（谜困度、最大切字熵、低信心切字计数）触发精细修正循环，将紧凑的不确定性报告回传给模型指导修正

Result: 在推理、数学和代码生成任务中，小模型达到参考推理模型质量的95%，成本仅为其三分之一，准确率比单次推理提升16个百分点

Conclusion: 这种基于不确定性的精细循环提供了质量和成本的有效平衡，适合实际生产部署

Abstract: Reasoning models often outperform smaller models but at 3--5$\times$ higher
cost and added latency. We present entropy-guided refinement: a lightweight,
test-time loop that uses token-level uncertainty to trigger a single, targeted
refinement pass. We extract logprobs, compute Shannon entropy on top-$k$
alternatives, and apply a simple OR-logic trigger over perplexity, maximum
token entropy, and low-confidence-token count. Unlike approaches that use
entropy only for measurement or decoding, we pass a compact uncertainty report
(tokens, confidences, alternatives, context) back to the model to guide
corrective edits. On representative technical queries across reasoning,
mathematics, and code generation tasks, a small model with our loop approaches
95\% of a reference reasoning model's quality at approximately one-third of the
cost. The method achieves selective refinement on ~31\% of responses while
improving accuracy by 16 percentage points over single-pass inference. We
demonstrate that this uncertainty-aware loop provides an effective middle
ground between single-pass inference and expensive reasoning chains, making it
practical for production deployments where both quality and cost matter.

Motivation: 探索人类检测和响应他人情感的能力对社会行为的基础性作用，研究情感知觉准确性如何影响出现的情感和空间行为

Method: 在2D向向空间中创建代理体，配备不同精度的情感分类器（JAFFE、CK+、KDEF），让代理体根据知觉到的情感向积极情感运动、避免消极情感，并在同质/异质群体中进行实验

Result: 低准确分类器导致信任下降、情感向悲伤分解、社会组织混乱；高准确分类器形成强壮情感聚集和弹性；甚至在中性场景中错觉也会导致隔离和聚聚性分解

Conclusion: 情感识别中的偏见或不精确可能会彻底扬曲社会过程并打断情感整合，强调了准确情感知觉对社会结构稳定性的关键作用

Abstract: The ability of humans to detect and respond to others' emotions is
fundamental to understanding social behavior. Here, agents are instantiated
with emotion classifiers of varying accuracy to study the impact of perceptual
accuracy on emergent emotional and spatial behavior. Agents are visually
represented with face photos from the KDEF database and endowed with one of
three classifiers trained on the JAFFE (poor), CK+ (medium), or KDEF (high)
datasets. Agents communicate locally on a 2D toroidal lattice, perceiving
neighbors' emotional state based on their classifier and responding with
movement toward perceived positive emotions and away from perceived negative
emotions. Note that the agents respond to perceived, instead of ground-truth,
emotions, introducing systematic misperception and frustration. A battery of
experiments is carried out on homogeneous and heterogeneous populations and
scenarios with repeated emotional shocks. Results show that low-accuracy
classifiers on the part of the agent reliably result in diminished trust,
emotional disintegration into sadness, and disordered social organization. By
contrast, the agent that develops high accuracy develops hardy emotional
clusters and resilience to emotional disruptions. Even in emotionally neutral
scenarios, misperception is enough to generate segregation and disintegration
of cohesion. These findings underscore the fact that biases or imprecision in
emotion recognition may significantly warp social processes and disrupt
emotional integration.

TL;DR: MODE是一种轻量级的检索增强生成方法，用聚类路由替代精细的最近邻搜索，适用于小规模领域特定语料库，在保持答案质量的同时显著降低检索时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的RAG方法依赖大型向量数据库和跨编码器，对于小规模领域特定语料库来说过于复杂和冗余，需要更轻量级的解决方案。

Method: 将文档嵌入后分组到语义连贯的聚类中，用缓存质心表示。查询时路由到顶部质心，仅在这些聚类内检索上下文，无需外部向量数据库基础设施和重排序。

Result: 在HotpotQA和SQuAD语料库（100-500个文本块）上，MODE在答案质量上达到或超过密集检索基线，同时减少了端到端检索时间。聚类粒度和多聚类路由控制召回率/精确度的权衡。

Conclusion: MODE为中小型语料库提供了一个实用的解决方案，特别适合需要简单性、速度和主题专注性的场景。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) often relies on large vector databases
and cross-encoders tuned for large-scale corpora, which can be excessive for
small, domain-specific collections. We present MODE (Mixture of Document
Experts), a lightweight alternative that replaces fine-grained nearest-neighbor
search with cluster-and-route retrieval. Documents are embedded, grouped into
semantically coherent clusters, and represented by cached centroids. At query
time, we route to the top centroid(s) and retrieve context only within those
clusters, eliminating external vector-database infrastructure and reranking
while keeping latency low. On HotpotQA and SQuAD corpora with 100-500 chunks,
MODE matches or exceeds a dense-retrieval baseline in answer quality while
reducing end-to-end retrieval time. Ablations show that cluster granularity and
multi-cluster routing control the recall/precision trade-off, and that tighter
clusters improve downstream accuracy. MODE offers a practical recipe for small
and medium corpora where simplicity, speed, and topical focus matter.

Method: 重新审视最新的标准测试集和产业部署，形式化适应性多维监控算法(AMDM)，包括异质指标标准化、按轴指数加权移动平均阈值和马哆拉距离联合异常检测。

Result: 在模拟目标偏移中，AMDM将异常检测延迟从12.3秒降至5.6秒，并将误报率从4.5%降至0.9%。提供了对照表、ROC/PR曲线和案例重分析。

Conclusion: AMDM算法能够有效监测自治AI系统的异常行为，提供了可重现的算法实现和实验数据，为高风险领域的AI系统监管提供了技术支撑。

Abstract: Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) -- multi-agent systems that combine
large language models with external tools and autonomous planning -- are
rapidly transitioning from research laboratories into high-stakes domains. Our
earlier "Basic" paper introduced a five-axis framework and proposed preliminary
metrics such as goal drift and harm reduction but did not provide an
algorithmic instantiation or empirical evidence. This "Advanced" sequel fills
that gap. First, we revisit recent benchmarks and industrial deployments to
show that technical metrics still dominate evaluations: a systematic review of
84 papers from 2023--2025 found that 83% report capability metrics while only
30% consider human-centred or economic axes [2]. Second, we formalise an
Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm that normalises
heterogeneous metrics, applies per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average
thresholds and performs joint anomaly detection via the Mahalanobis distance.
Third, we conduct simulations and real-world experiments. AMDM cuts
anomaly-detection latency from 12.3 s to 5.6 s on simulated goal drift and
reduces false-positive rates from 4.5% to 0.9% compared with static thresholds.
We present a comparison table and ROC/PR curves, and we reanalyse case studies
to surface missing metrics. Code, data and a reproducibility checklist
accompany this paper to facilitate replication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的RLVF方法依赖稀疏的基于结果的奖励，无法为推理过程提供细粒度指导，限制了学习效率。模型无法区分高质量和低效的解决方案，也无法从不同类型的失败中有效学习。

Method: 提出Difficulty Aware Certainty guided Exploration (DACE)算法，基于策略成功率在线评估任务难度，并利用该信号调节内在奖励：对于困难任务惩罚高确定性以鼓励探索，对于简单任务奖励高确定性以提高学习效率。

Result: 在AIME和MATH等数学推理基准测试中，DACE显著优于强基线方法。DACE训练的模型不仅准确率更高，而且在扩展测试时计算时表现出更稳健的性能。

Conclusion: DACE的自适应方法能够在不牺牲精度的情况下促进有效探索，验证了利用模型自信心度来指导强化学习的有效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Feedback (RLVF) has become a key
technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, its reliance on sparse, outcome based rewards, which only
indicate if a final answer is correct or not, fails to provide granular
guidance on the reasoning process itself. This limitation hinders efficient
learning, as the model cannot distinguish between high quality and inefficient
solutions, nor can it learn effectively from different types of failures. To
address this, we observe that an LLMs self-certainty often correlates with task
difficulty and solution quality. We introduce Difficulty Aware Certainty guided
Exploration (DACE), a novel RL algorithm that leverages this insight to
dynamically balance the exploration exploitation trade-off. DACE assesses task
difficulty online based on the policys success rate. It then uses this signal
to modulate an intrinsic reward: for difficult tasks where the model is
struggling, DACE encourages exploration by penalizing high certainty; for
easier tasks, it encourages learning efficiency by rewarding high certainty.
Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME, MATH) show
that DACE significantly outperforms strong baselines. The DACE-trained models
not only achieve higher accuracy but also demonstrate more robust performance
when scaling test-time compute, validating that our adaptive approach fosters
effective exploration without sacrificing precision.

Result: 与埃塞俄比亚公共卫生研究所和卫生部合作，在三个地区的多种规划场景中验证了方法的实证效果

Conclusion: HARP工具为埃塞俄比亚医疗资源规划提供了有效的优化框架，能够在预算不确定条件下最大化医疗覆盖并满足地区公平性要求

Abstract: As part of nationwide efforts aligned with the United Nations' Sustainable
Development Goal 3 on Universal Health Coverage, Ethiopia's Ministry of Health
is strengthening health posts to expand access to essential healthcare
services. However, only a fraction of this health system strengthening effort
can be implemented each year due to limited budgets and other competing
priorities, thus the need for an optimization framework to guide prioritization
across the regions of Ethiopia. In this paper, we develop a tool, Health Access
Resource Planner (HARP), based on a principled decision-support optimization
framework for sequential facility planning that aims to maximize population
coverage under budget uncertainty while satisfying region-specific
proportionality targets at every time step. We then propose two algorithms: (i)
a learning-augmented approach that improves upon expert recommendations at any
single-step; and (ii) a greedy algorithm for multi-step planning, both with
strong worst-case approximation estimation. In collaboration with the Ethiopian
Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health, we demonstrated the empirical
efficacy of our method on three regions across various planning scenarios.

Motivation: 研究如何将个体层面的证据、信念和知识概念扩展到群体层面，探索群体知识形成机制和证据共享的动态过程。

Method: 采用多智能体证据模型的拓扑语义方法，构建群体证据逻辑的形式化系统，包括静态和动态算子，并进行公理化和可判定性证明。

Result: 成功公理化了群体证据逻辑及其动态扩展，证明了这些逻辑系统的可判定性，并建立了动态算子与静态基础的共表达能力。

Abstract: We study notions of (virtual) group knowledge and group belief within
multi-agent evidence models, obtained by extending the topological semantics of
evidence-based belief and fallible knowledge from individuals to groups. We
completely axiomatize and show the decidability of the logic of ("hard" and
"soft") group evidence, and do the same for an especially interesting fragment
of it: the logic of group knowledge and group belief. We also extend these
languages with dynamic evidence-sharing operators, and completely axiomatize
the corresponding logics, showing that they are co-expressive with their static
bases.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiVA是一个新型自主代理框架，通过语义-拓扑进化算法将工作流程建模为自组织图，解决了现有方法在环境适应性方面的权衡问题，在多个基准测试中实现了5-10%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自主代理系统面临关键权衡：固定工作流需要手动重新配置以适应环境变化，而灵活反应循环无法将推理进展提炼为可转移结构。需要一种既能自适应环境变化又能保留可重用知识的方法。

Method: 提出分层变量代理(HiVA)框架，使用语义-拓扑进化(STEV)算法将代理工作流建模为自组织图。该算法通过多臂老虎机前向路由、环境反馈生成诊断梯度，以及协调更新来共同进化个体语义和拓扑结构。

Result: 在对话、编码、长上下文问答、数学和代理基准测试中，HiVA相比现有基线在任务准确率上提升了5-10%，并提高了资源效率。

Conclusion: HiVA框架通过语义-拓扑协同进化，在未知环境中实现了自主任务执行的集体优化，证明了其在自主代理系统中的有效性。

Abstract: Autonomous agents play a crucial role in advancing Artificial General
Intelligence, enabling problem decomposition and tool orchestration through
Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing paradigms face a critical
trade-off. On one hand, reusable fixed workflows require manual reconfiguration
upon environmental changes; on the other hand, flexible reactive loops fail to
distill reasoning progress into transferable structures. We introduce
Hierarchical Variable Agent (HiVA), a novel framework modeling agentic
workflows as self-organized graphs with the Semantic-Topological Evolution
(STEV) algorithm, which optimizes hybrid semantic-topological spaces using
textual gradients as discrete-domain surrogates for backpropagation. The
iterative process comprises Multi-Armed Bandit-infused forward routing,
diagnostic gradient generation from environmental feedback, and coordinated
updates that co-evolve individual semantics and topology for collective
optimization in unknown environments. Experiments on dialogue, coding,
Long-context Q&A, mathematical, and agentic benchmarks demonstrate improvements
of 5-10% in task accuracy and enhanced resource efficiency over existing
baselines, establishing HiVA's effectiveness in autonomous task execution.

*Rimom Costa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ILWS通过指令级权重塑形实现LLMs的动态知识更新，无需微调或检索增强，通过反射引擎分析对话并更新外部可审计的伪参数，显著提升企业支持效率并减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如RAG增加延迟和工程开销，提示工程脆弱且可能与先验知识冲突，微调成本高且存在灾难性遗忘问题，需要一种更高效、可控的知识更新方法。

Method: 使用指令级权重塑形(ILWS)，通过反射引擎分析对话轨迹，诊断推理成功与失败，提出类型化增量ΔK=(ΔS,ΔU,ΔT)来更新指令、用户偏好和工具，并通过受控蒸馏将提示空间改进转换为权重空间。

Result: 在企业支持中吞吐量提高2.4-5.0倍，审计幻觉减少约80%；在Adobe Commerce Cloud概念验证中，每小时工单处理量提高4-5倍，单工单时间降低约80%。

Conclusion: ILWS在指令层操作直到受控蒸馏，适用于需要自适应推理、工具创建和低延迟部署的动态领域，如法律、医疗和工程领域，提供了可治理的高效知识更新方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are fluent but largely static after
pre-training; new or shifting knowledge is typically added with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or fine-tuning. RAG raises latency and
engineering overhead and often fails to integrate facts; prompt engineering is
brittle and can conflict with prior knowledge; fine-tuning is costly and risks
catastrophic forgetting. We propose Instruction-Level Weight Shaping (ILWS):
curated system instructions act as external, auditable pseudo-parameters
updated after each session via reflection and user feedback. A Reflection
Engine inspects conversation traces, diagnoses reasoning successes and
failures, and proposes typed deltas $\Delta K=(\Delta S,\Delta U,\Delta T)$
over instructions, user preferences, and tools. Deltas are version-controlled,
evaluated with a sliding window of 1-5 star ratings, auto-repaired on first
failure, and rolled back on repeated failure. When an edit budget crosses a
threshold, the agent compiles a rating-weighted synthetic set and distills
matured instruction-space gains into parameters, converting prompt-space
improvements into weight-space without downtime. ILWS makes explicit the
low-rank shaping induced by context in transformer blocks, preserves
governance, and removes per-call retrieval. In enterprise support it increased
throughput 2.4-5.0x and cut audited hallucinations by about 80% versus a frozen
baseline. In an Adobe Commerce Cloud proof of concept "L0 Support", it achieved
4-5x more tickets per hour and about 80% lower time per ticket, with autonomous
instruction updates and optional tool synthesis. Because ILWS operates at the
instruction layer until controlled distillation, it generalizes to dynamic
domains (legal, medical, engineering) requiring adaptive reasoning, tool
creation, and low-latency deployment.

TL;DR: SHERPA是一个模型驱动框架，通过将领域特定最佳实践融入分层状态机来提升LLM在复杂任务中的表现，实现更细粒度的行为控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂任务中缺乏结构化推理能力，特别是需要领域特定最佳实践的任务，而这些实践往往不在训练数据中。现有的多步提示方法缺乏通用机制来控制LLM行为。

Method: 提出SHERPA框架，使用分层状态机结构化LLM执行过程，通过基于规则的或机器学习驱动的方法（包括LLM本身）实现细粒度行为控制。

Result: 在代码生成、类名生成和问答等多种任务上，SHERPA不仅复现了先前方法的性能，还进一步提升了表现。系统评估显示，精心设计的状态机显著提高了LLM输出质量。

Conclusion: SHERPA框架通过状态机集成领域最佳实践，特别适用于具有完善人类最佳实践但缺乏训练数据的复杂任务，为LLM行为控制提供了有效的通用机制。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved widespread application
across various fields. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs suffer from
a lack of structured reasoning ability, particularly for complex tasks
requiring domain-specific best practices, which are often unavailable in the
training data. Although multi-step prompting methods incorporating human best
practices, such as chain-of-thought and tree-of-thought, have gained
popularity, they lack a general mechanism to control LLM behavior. In this
paper, we propose SHERPA, a model-driven framework to improve the LLM
performance on complex tasks by explicitly incorporating domain-specific best
practices into hierarchical state machines. By structuring the LLM execution
processes using state machines, SHERPA enables more fine-grained control over
their behavior via rules or decisions driven by machine learning-based
approaches, including LLMs. We show that SHERPA is applicable to a wide variety
of tasks-specifically, code generation, class name generation, and question
answering-replicating previously proposed approaches while further improving
the performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SHERPA for the
aforementioned tasks using various LLMs. Our systematic evaluation compares
different state machine configurations against baseline approaches without
state machines. Results show that integrating well-designed state machines
significantly improves the quality of LLM outputs, and is particularly
beneficial for complex tasks with well-established human best practices but
lacking data used for training LLMs.

TL;DR: SIGMUS系统利用大语言模型自动整合城市多模态传感器数据，构建知识图谱来识别和分析城市事件，无需依赖人工规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市多模态传感器数据丰富但碎片化，传统依赖人工推理难以有效整合数据来识别和分析城市事件（如紧急事件、社会活动、自然灾害）。

Method: 开发SIGMUS系统，使用大语言模型生成世界知识，识别城市事件与多模态数据间的关系，构建组织事件、观测数据等的知识图谱。

Result: 系统能够合理连接5种不同数据源（新闻文本、监控图像、空气质量、天气和交通测量）与同时同地发生的相关事件。

Conclusion: SIGMUS成功实现了城市多模态数据的语义整合，为自动事件识别和分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Modern urban spaces are equipped with an increasingly diverse set of sensors,
all producing an abundance of multimodal data. Such multimodal data can be used
to identify and reason about important incidents occurring in urban landscapes,
such as major emergencies, cultural and social events, as well as natural
disasters. However, such data may be fragmented over several sources and
difficult to integrate due to the reliance on human-driven reasoning for
identifying relationships between the multimodal data corresponding to an
incident, as well as understanding the different components which define an
incident. Such relationships and components are critical to identifying the
causes of such incidents, as well as producing forecasting the scale and
intensity of future incidents as they begin to develop. In this work, we create
SIGMUS, a system for Semantic Integration for Knowledge Graphs in Multimodal
Urban Spaces. SIGMUS uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce the necessary
world knowledge for identifying relationships between incidents occurring in
urban spaces and data from different modalities, allowing us to organize
evidence and observations relevant to an incident without relying and
human-encoded rules for relating multimodal sensory data with incidents. This
organized knowledge is represented as a knowledge graph, organizing incidents,
observations, and much more. We find that our system is able to produce
reasonable connections between 5 different data sources (new article text, CCTV
images, air quality, weather, and traffic measurements) and relevant incidents
occurring at the same time and location.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自主数字代理在结构化任务中展现潜力，但尚不清楚基于代理的系统能在多大程度上提高多模态网络数据生产力，特别是在需要迭代规划、解释和上下文推理的新闻领域。

Method: 引入NEWSAGENT基准测试，要求代理根据写作指令和原始数据，识别叙事视角、基于关键词查询、检索历史背景并生成完整文章，核心上下文需要主动发现而非直接提供。

Result: 评估显示代理能够检索相关事实，但在规划和叙事整合方面存在困难。开源和闭源LLM在常用代理框架上的表现表明了这一挑战。

Conclusion: NEWSAGENT为迭代和评估代理在多模态网络数据操作方面的能力提供了一个现实的测试平台，有助于推动代理在真实世界生产力中的应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous digital agents from industry (e.g., Manus AI
and Gemini's research mode) highlight potential for structured tasks by
autonomous decision-making and task decomposition; however, it remains unclear
to what extent the agent-based systems can improve multimodal web data
productivity. We study this in the realm of journalism, which requires
iterative planning, interpretation, and contextual reasoning from multimodal
raw contents to form a well structured news. We introduce NEWSAGENT, a
benchmark for evaluating how agents can automatically search available raw
contents, select desired information, and edit and rephrase to form a news
article by accessing core journalistic functions. Given a writing instruction
and firsthand data as how a journalist initiates a news draft, agents are
tasked to identify narrative perspectives, issue keyword-based queries,
retrieve historical background, and generate complete articles. Unlike typical
summarization or retrieval tasks, essential context is not directly available
and must be actively discovered, reflecting the information gaps faced in
real-world news writing. NEWSAGENT includes 6k human-verified examples derived
from real news, with multimodal contents converted to text for broad model
compatibility. We evaluate open- and closed-sourced LLMs with commonly-used
agentic frameworks on NEWSAGENT, which shows that agents are capable of
retrieving relevant facts but struggling with planning and narrative
integration. We believe that NEWSAGENT serves a realistic testbed for iterating
and evaluating agent capabilities in terms of multimodal web data manipulation
to real-world productivity.

data visualization field, multi-agent systems can be useful for employing
agents throughout the entire data-to-communication pipeline. We present a
lightweight multi-agent system that automates the data analysis workflow, from
data exploration to generating coherent visual narratives for insight
communication. Our approach combines a hybrid multi-agent architecture with
deterministic components, strategically externalizing critical logic from LLMs
to improve transparency and reliability. The system delivers granular, modular
outputs that enable surgical modifications without full regeneration,
supporting sustainable human-AI collaboration. We evaluated our system across 4
diverse datasets, demonstrating strong generalizability, narrative quality, and
computational efficiency with minimal dependencies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冰淇淋的融化稳定性是影响消费者接受度和产品质量的关键因素，需要寻找既能改善质地结构又能延缓融化的经济有效的稳定剂配方。

Method: 制备含不同稳定剂的冰淇淋样品，在受控条件下进行融化测试，使用延时摄影记录融化过程，并利用Python和OpenCV进行图像处理和分析。

Result: 所有样品融化后仍保持泡沫状结构，表明稳定剂有助于形成稳定的气泡基质；重新冷冻后再融化的样品显示结构更加坚固；不同稳定剂的效果存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了常用食品添加剂在冰淇淋配方中的功能作用，通过平衡性能与成本，为小规模和商业冰淇淋生产提供了经济高效的配方开发潜力。

Abstract: The stability of ice cream during melting is a critical factor for consumer's
acceptance and product quality. With the commonly added stabilizer to improve
texture, structure and slower melting as the factors to analyze. This report
explores the effects of locust bean gum, guar gum, maltodextrin, and
carrageenan on the melting behavior of homemade ice cream. The main objective
was to assess how these additives influence melting resistance and to identify
a more cost-effective recipe formulation. Ice cream samples incorporating each
additive were prepared and subjected to melting tests under controlled
conditions. Timelapse recordings were used to capture and analyze the
progression of melting over time. Python and OpenCV is used for process and
analysis. Observations revealed that all samples retained a foam-like structure
even after melting, suggesting the stabilizers contributed to the formation of
a stable air-cell matrix. Furthermore, when the melted samples were re-frozen
and subsequently melted again, they displayed increased sturdiness, indicating
improved resilience of the ice cream structure. Comparative analysis of the
different stabilizers highlighted variations in their effectiveness, with some
offering stronger melting resistance and structural support than others.
Overall, the findings provide insights into the functional roles of commonly
used food additives in ice cream formulation. By evaluating both performance
and cost, this study demonstrates the potential for developing recipes that
balance durability with economic efficiency, contributing to practical
applications in both small-scale and commercial ice cream production.

Abstract: We propose a novel SuperBrain framework for collective intelligence, grounded
in the co-evolution of large language models (LLMs) and human users. Unlike
static prompt engineering or isolated agent simulations, our approach
emphasizes a dynamic pathway from Subclass Brain to Superclass Brain: (1) A
Subclass Brain arises from persistent, personalized interaction between a user
and an LLM, forming a cognitive dyad with adaptive learning memory. (2) Through
GA-assisted forward-backward evolution, these dyads iteratively refine prompts
and task performance. (3) Multiple Subclass Brains coordinate via Swarm
Intelligence, optimizing across multi-objective fitness landscapes and
exchanging distilled heuristics. (4) Their standardized behaviors and cognitive
signatures integrate into a Superclass Brain, an emergent meta-intelligence
capable of abstraction, generalization and self-improvement. We outline the
theoretical constructs, present initial implementations (e.g., UAV scheduling,
KU/KI keyword filtering) and propose a registry for cross-dyad knowledge
consolidation. This work provides both a conceptual foundation and an
architectural roadmap toward scalable, explainable and ethically aligned
collective AI.

Motivation: 人类能直觉地模拟未言明的社交动态并推理他人视角，而AI系统在自动结构和推理这些隐式社交上下文方面存在困难

Method: 采用POMDP驱动设计，将社交互动表示为结构化元组（状态、观察、代理动作、心智状态），可从自由形式叙述中自动推导

Result: 在5个社交推理任务中显著提升LLM理解能力（如FANToM心理理论推理+51%），在SOTOPIA社交互动基准上决策改进达+18%

Conclusion: S3AP作为强大的通用社会世界状态表示形式，有望开发出更具社交意识的系统，更好地导航社交互动

Abstract: Humans intuitively navigate social interactions by simulating unspoken
dynamics and reasoning about others' perspectives, even with limited
information. In contrast, AI systems struggle to automatically structure and
reason about these implicit social contexts. In this paper, we introduce a
novel structured social world representation formalism (S3AP), designed to help
AI systems reason more effectively about social dynamics. Following a
POMDP-driven design, S3AP represents social interactions as structured tuples,
such as state, observation, agent actions, and mental states, which can be
automatically induced from free-form narratives or other inputs. We first show
S3AP can help LLMs better understand social narratives across 5 social
reasoning tasks (e.g., +51% improvement on FANToM's theory-of-mind reasoning
with OpenAI's o1), reaching new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We then
induce social world models from these structured representations, demonstrating
their ability to predict future social dynamics and improve agent
decision-making, yielding up to +18% improvement on the SOTOPIA social
interaction benchmark. Our findings highlight the promise of S3AP as a
powerful, general-purpose representation for social world states, enabling the
development of more socially-aware systems that better navigate social
interactions.

TL;DR: BALM-TSF是一个轻量级多模态时间序列预测框架，通过平衡文本和时间序列模态的对齐，解决了现有方法中模态不平衡导致信息丢失的问题，在长期和少样本预测中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的多模态时间序列预测方法存在文本和时间序列模态之间的巨大差异，导致架构往往过度强调一个模态而忽视另一个，造成信息损失和预测性能下降。

Method: 使用时间序列编码器处理原始时间序列，同时将时间序列的统计特征输入带可学习提示的LLM生成文本嵌入。通过简单的缩放策略和对比目标，将文本嵌入映射到时间序列嵌入的潜在空间，实现跨模态平衡对齐。最后将对齐的文本语义嵌入和时间序列嵌入整合进行预测。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，BALM-TSF以最少的可训练参数，在长期和少样本预测任务中都达到了最先进的性能，证明了其有效利用文本和时间序列互补信息的能力。

Conclusion: BALM-TSF通过平衡的多模态对齐机制成功解决了时间序列预测中的模态不平衡问题，为LLM-based时间序列预测提供了有效的轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a long-standing and highly challenging research
topic. Recently, driven by the rise of large language models (LLMs), research
has increasingly shifted from purely time series methods toward harnessing
textual modalities to enhance forecasting performance. However, the vast
discrepancy between text and temporal data often leads current multimodal
architectures to over-emphasise one modality while neglecting the other,
resulting in information loss that harms forecasting performance. To address
this modality imbalance, we introduce BALM-TSF (Balanced Multimodal Alignment
for LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting), a lightweight time series forecasting
framework that maintains balance between the two modalities. Specifically, raw
time series are processed by the time series encoder, while descriptive
statistics of raw time series are fed to an LLM with learnable prompt,
producing compact textual embeddings. To ensure balanced cross-modal context
alignment of time series and textual embeddings, a simple yet effective scaling
strategy combined with a contrastive objective then maps these textual
embeddings into the latent space of the time series embeddings. Finally, the
aligned textual semantic embeddings and time series embeddings are together
integrated for forecasting. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show
that, with minimal trainable parameters, BALM-TSF achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both long-term and few-shot forecasting, confirming its ability
to harness complementary information from text and time series. Code is
available at https://github.com/ShiqiaoZhou/BALM-TSF.

Method: 用户用自然语言规则定义状态依赖动作，这些抽象规范被编译成非确定性有限自动机(NFAs)，状态合成组件将其转换为可重用的可执行代码，支持确定性重放、状态缓存减少冗余LLM调用，并能快速适应应用接口变化。

Result: NetGent自动化了50多个工作流，涵盖视频点播、直播、视频会议、社交媒体和网络爬虫等领域，生成了真实流量轨迹，并对UI变异性保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NetGent通过结合基于语言代理的灵活性和编译执行的可靠性，为生成多样化、可重复的数据集提供了可扩展基础，推动了网络ML的发展。

Abstract: We present NetGent, an AI-agent framework for automating complex application
workflows to generate realistic network traffic datasets. Developing
generalizable ML models for networking requires data collection from network
environments with traffic that results from a diverse set of real-world web
applications. However, using existing browser automation tools that are
diverse, repeatable, realistic, and efficient remains fragile and costly.
NetGent addresses this challenge by allowing users to specify workflows as
natural-language rules that define state-dependent actions. These abstract
specifications are compiled into nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs), which
a state synthesis component translates into reusable, executable code. This
design enables deterministic replay, reduces redundant LLM calls through state
caching, and adapts quickly when application interfaces change. In experiments,
NetGent automated more than 50+ workflows spanning video-on-demand streaming,
live video streaming, video conferencing, social media, and web scraping,
producing realistic traffic traces while remaining robust to UI variability. By
combining the flexibility of language-based agents with the reliability of
compiled execution, NetGent provides a scalable foundation for generating the
diverse, repeatable datasets needed to advance ML in networking.

TL;DR: 本文提出模块化多智能体框架，将法律推理分解为知识获取和应用两个阶段，显著提升AI法律推理的准确性和可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律推理需要精确解释法律条文和一致应用复杂规则，这对AI系统构成重大挑战，需要更透明和可验证的方法

Method: 采用模块化多智能体框架：第一阶段由专门智能体提取法律概念并形式化规则；第二阶段通过查询分析、符号推理和程序化实现三个步骤应用知识到具体案例

Result: 在法定税务计算任务上，基础模型准确率达到76.4%，相比基线18.8%有显著提升，有效缩小了推理模型与基础模型之间的性能差距

Conclusion: 模块化架构和形式化知识表示可以使复杂的法律推理通过计算高效模型实现，同时增强AI法律推理的一致性和可解释性，为未来更透明、可信和有效的法律AI系统奠定基础

Abstract: Legal reasoning requires both precise interpretation of statutory language
and consistent application of complex rules, presenting significant challenges
for AI systems. This paper introduces a modular multi-agent framework that
decomposes legal reasoning into distinct knowledge acquisition and application
stages. In the first stage, specialized agents extract legal concepts and
formalize rules to create verifiable intermediate representations of statutes.
The second stage applies this knowledge to specific cases through three steps:
analyzing queries to map case facts onto the ontology schema, performing
symbolic inference to derive logically entailed conclusions, and generating
final answers using a programmatic implementation that operationalizes the
ontological knowledge. This bridging of natural language understanding with
symbolic reasoning provides explicit and verifiable inspection points,
significantly enhancing transparency compared to end-to-end approaches.
Evaluation on statutory tax calculation tasks demonstrates substantial
improvements, with foundational models achieving 76.4\% accuracy compared to
18.8\% baseline performance, effectively narrowing the performance gap between
reasoning and foundational models. These findings suggest that modular
architectures with formalized knowledge representations can make sophisticated
legal reasoning more accessible through computationally efficient models while
enhancing consistency and explainability in AI legal reasoning, establishing a
foundation for future research into more transparent, trustworthy, and
effective AI systems for legal domain.

TL;DR: OmniDPO是一个偏好对齐框架，通过构建文本偏好和多模态偏好样本对，解决全模态大语言模型中的幻觉问题，增强模型对音频-视频交互的理解和注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全模态大语言模型在音频-视频理解和环境感知方面取得显著进展，但仍存在幻觉问题。文本模态先验主导导致模型过度依赖文本线索而忽视视觉和音频信息，且现有模型在训练时独立对齐各模态，忽略了视频与音频的内在关联。

Method: 提出OmniDPO偏好对齐框架，包含两种策略：(1)构建文本偏好样本对以增强模型对音频-视频交互的理解；(2)构建多模态偏好样本对以强化模型对视觉和听觉信息的注意力。

Result: 在两个全模态大语言模型上的实验表明，OmniDPO不仅有效缓解多模态幻觉，还显著提升了模型跨模态推理能力。

Conclusion: OmniDPO通过同时解决文本主导和多模态关联问题，有效改善了多模态基础能力并减少了幻觉现象，代码和数据集将在论文接受后发布。

Abstract: Recently, Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) have sparked a new wave of
research, achieving impressive results in tasks such as audio-video
understanding and real-time environment perception. However, hallucination
issues still persist. Similar to the bimodal setting, the priors from the text
modality tend to dominate, leading OLLMs to rely more heavily on textual cues
while neglecting visual and audio information. In addition, fully multimodal
scenarios introduce new challenges. Most existing models align visual or
auditory modalities with text independently during training, while ignoring the
intrinsic correlations between video and its corresponding audio. This
oversight results in hallucinations when reasoning requires interpreting hidden
audio cues embedded in video content. To address these challenges, we propose
OmniDPO, a preference-alignment framework designed to mitigate hallucinations
in OLLMs. Specifically, OmniDPO incorporates two strategies: (1) constructing
text-preference sample pairs to enhance the model's understanding of
audio-video interactions; and (2) constructing multimodal-preference sample
pairs to strengthen the model's attention to visual and auditory information.
By tackling both challenges, OmniDPO effectively improves multimodal grounding
and reduces hallucination. Experiments conducted on two OLLMs demonstrate that
OmniDPO not only effectively mitigates multimodal hallucinations but also
significantly enhances the models' reasoning capabilities across modalities.
All code and datasets will be released upon paper acceptance.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种结构化上下文注入框架，通过在LLM输入中系统嵌入任务特定信息来提升图象任务的解决能力，无需微调且效果优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLM在各领域表现强劲，但某些图象推理任务仍靠概念基础表示才能有效解决，而通过微调或多步查询实现这种映射成本较高且效率低。

Method: 提出结构化上下文注入方法，直接在输入中注入结构化上下文，使LLM能够隐式对齐任务与基础概念空间，无需微调模型。

Result: 在多个图象任务上评估，方法带来了一致的性能提升，结构化输入上下文的效果可以抵或超越更复杂的方法。

Conclusion: 结构化上下文注入是一种高效且可扩展的策略，能够有效地提升LLM在图象理解任务上的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in solving
problems across domains, including graph-related tasks traditionally addressed
by symbolic or algorithmic methods. In this work, we present a framework for
structured context injection, where task-specific information is systematically
embedded in the input to guide LLMs in solving a wide range of graph problems.
Our method does not require fine-tuning of LLMs, making it cost-efficient and
lightweight. We observe that certain graph reasoning tasks remain challenging
for LLMs unless they are mapped to conceptually grounded representations.
However, achieving such mappings through fine-tuning or repeated multi-step
querying can be expensive and inefficient. Our approach offers a practical
alternative by injecting structured context directly into the input, enabling
the LLM to implicitly align the task with grounded conceptual spaces. We
evaluate the approach on multiple graph tasks using both lightweight and large
models, highlighting the trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost.
The results demonstrate consistent performance improvements, showing that
structured input context can rival or surpass more complex approaches. Our
findings underscore the value of structured context injection as an effective
and scalable strategy for graph understanding with LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单次检索增强生成(RAG)在法律问答中存在幻觉和不确定性，需要更精确的法律检索和验证机制来处理高风险法律领域的问题。

Method: 将查询分解为子问题，在异构源(网络搜索、本地RAG、案例法)进行定向搜索，使用法官智能体验证充分性、管辖权和时效性，通过迭代推理-搜索-验证循环合成答案。

Result: 在200个最新法律选择题的LegalSearchQA基准测试中，L-MARS显著提高了事实准确性，减少了不确定性，并获得人类专家和LLM法官更高的偏好评分。

Conclusion: 多智能体推理与智能搜索为在高风险法律领域部署LLMs提供了可扩展且可复现的蓝图，能够实现精确的法律检索和审议。

Abstract: We present L-MARS (Legal Multi-Agent Workflow with Orchestrated Reasoning and
Agentic Search), a system that reduces hallucination and uncertainty in legal
question answering through coordinated multi-agent reasoning and retrieval.
Unlike single-pass retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), L-MARS decomposes
queries into subproblems, issues targeted searches across heterogeneous sources
(Serper web, local RAG, CourtListener case law), and employs a Judge Agent to
verify sufficiency, jurisdiction, and temporal validity before answer
synthesis. This iterative reasoning-search-verification loop maintains
coherence, filters noisy evidence, and grounds answers in authoritative law. We
evaluated L-MARS on LegalSearchQA, a new benchmark of 200 up-to-date multiple
choice legal questions in 2025. Results show that L-MARS substantially improves
factual accuracy, reduces uncertainty, and achieves higher preference scores
from both human experts and LLM-based judges. Our work demonstrates that
multi-agent reasoning with agentic search offers a scalable and reproducible
blueprint for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains requiring precise legal
retrieval and deliberation.

Result: 方法提高了准确性和校准度，降低了物理违规率，相对于基线降低了采样成本

Conclusion: 适度的领域感知约束结合轨迹级选择为过程感知属性预测和闭环材料设计提供了可靠、高效的大型推理模型的实用路径

Abstract: AI-driven materials discovery that couples automated experimentation with
algorithmic decision-making requires process aware recipe to property
predictors that are accurate, calibrated, and physically admissible. We
approach this as a reasoning problem with large reasoning models (LRMs). To
instill reasoning capability into language models, we curate reasoning traces
from a teacher model to train a student model. However, most training pipelines
select reasoning traces using binary correctness or learned preference signals
that poorly reflect physical admissibility. We introduce Physics-aware
Rejection Sampling (PaRS), a training-time trace selection scheme that favors
traces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets,
with lightweight halting to control compute. We instantiate our framework with
a large student model fine-tuned on traces synthesized by a larger teacher
model, and evaluate under matched token budgets against various rejection
sampling baselines. Our method improves accuracy and calibration, reduces
physics-violation rates, and lowers sampling cost relative to baselines. These
results indicate that modest, domain-aware constraints combined with
trace-level selection provide a practical path toward reliable, efficient LRMs
for process-aware property prediction and closed-loop materials design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夏普比率是金融领域广泛使用的风险调整收益指标，但在MDP中优化存在两个挑战：动态规划不适用于分数目标和风险度量。需要开发有效的算法来解决这个问题。

Method: 使用Dinkelbach变换将夏普比率优化转换为均值-方差优化问题，开发迭代算法通过不断更新风险敏感参数来求解，并设计了策略迭代程序。

Result: 提出的算法能够单调收敛到最优夏普比率，在平均和贴现MDP设置下都证明了收敛性，数值实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 这是首个使用动态规划类算法解决MDP中夏普比率优化问题的方法，为解决其他分数目标MDP问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sharpe ratio (also known as reward-to-variability ratio) is a widely-used
metric in finance, which measures the additional return at the cost of per unit
of increased risk (standard deviation of return). However, the optimization of
Sharpe ratio in Markov decision processes (MDPs) is challenging, because there
exist two difficulties hindering the application of dynamic programming. One is
that dynamic programming does not work for fractional objectives, and the other
is that dynamic programming is invalid for risk metrics. In this paper, we
study the Sharpe ratio optimization in infinite-horizon MDPs, considering both
the long-run average and discounted settings. We address the first challenge
with the Dinkelbachs transform, which converts the Sharpe ratio objective to a
mean-squared-variance (M2V) objective. It is shown that the M2V optimization
and the original Sharpe ratio optimization share the same optimal policy when
the risk-sensitive parameter is equal to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For the
second challenge, we develop an iterative algorithm to solve the M2V
optimization which is similar to a mean-variance optimization in MDPs. We
iteratively solve the M2V problem and obtain the associated Sharpe ratio that
is used to update the risk-sensitive parameter in the next iteration of M2V
problems. We show that such a sequence of Sharpe ratios derived is
monotonically increasing and converges to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For both
average and discounted MDP settings, we develop a policy iteration procedure
and prove its convergence to the optimum. Numerical experiments are conducted
for validation. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first that
solves the Sharpe ratio optimization in MDPs with dynamic programming type
algorithms. We believe that the proposed algorithm can shed light on solving
MDPs with other fractional objectives.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于业务流程管理，还可应用于任何符号序列生成任务，推动了神经符号AI的发展。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of suffix prediction in Business Process
Management (BPM) by proposing a Neuro-Symbolic Predictive Process Monitoring
(PPM) approach that integrates data-driven learning with temporal logic-based
prior knowledge. While recent approaches leverage deep learning models for
suffix prediction, they often fail to satisfy even basic logical constraints
due to the absence of explicit integration of domain knowledge during training.
We propose a novel method to incorporate Linear Temporal Logic over finite
traces (LTLf) into the training process of autoregressive sequence predictors.
Our approach introduces a differentiable logical loss function, defined using a
soft approximation of LTLf semantics and the Gumbel-Softmax trick, which can be
combined with standard predictive losses. This ensures the model learns to
generate suffixes that are both accurate and logically consistent. Experimental
evaluation on three real-world datasets shows that our method improves suffix
prediction accuracy and compliance with temporal constraints. We also introduce
two variants of the logic loss (local and global) and demonstrate their
effectiveness under noisy and realistic settings. While developed in the
context of BPM, our framework is applicable to any symbolic sequence generation
task and contributes toward advancing Neuro-Symbolic AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 闭环胰岛素输送系统(CLIDS)在1型糖尿病中的实际采用率低，主要由于行为、心理和社会障碍而非技术问题，需要评估LLM在健康行为改变中的说服能力。

Method: 创建包含专家验证虚拟患者的框架，模拟与配备多种循证说服策略的护士代理进行多轮互动，支持纵向咨询和对抗性社交影响场景。

Result: 较大型和更具反思性的LLM能够随时间调整策略，但所有模型都难以克服抵抗，特别是在现实社交压力下。

Conclusion: 结果揭示了当前LLM在行为改变方面的关键局限性，为推进医疗保健等领域可信赖的说服性AI提供了高保真、可扩展的测试平台。

Abstract: Real-world adoption of closed-loop insulin delivery systems (CLIDS) in type 1
diabetes remains low, driven not by technical failure, but by diverse
behavioral, psychosocial, and social barriers. We introduce ChatCLIDS, the
first benchmark to rigorously evaluate LLM-driven persuasive dialogue for
health behavior change. Our framework features a library of expert-validated
virtual patients, each with clinically grounded, heterogeneous profiles and
realistic adoption barriers, and simulates multi-turn interactions with nurse
agents equipped with a diverse set of evidence-based persuasive strategies.
ChatCLIDS uniquely supports longitudinal counseling and adversarial social
influence scenarios, enabling robust, multi-dimensional evaluation. Our
findings reveal that while larger and more reflective LLMs adapt strategies
over time, all models struggle to overcome resistance, especially under
realistic social pressure. These results highlight critical limitations of
current LLMs for behavior change, and offer a high-fidelity, scalable testbed
for advancing trustworthy persuasive AI in healthcare and beyond.

Conclusion: 证明了神经MCCFR组件效果的规模依赖性，提供了具有收敛保证的系统化策略框架，为大规模游戏的实际部署提供了实用指南。

Abstract: Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR) has emerged as a
cornerstone algorithm for solving extensive-form games, but its integration
with deep neural networks introduces scale-dependent challenges that manifest
differently across game complexities. This paper presents a comprehensive
analysis of how neural MCCFR component effectiveness varies with game scale and
proposes an adaptive framework for selective component deployment. We identify
that theoretical risks such as nonstationary target distribution shifts, action
support collapse, variance explosion, and warm-starting bias have
scale-dependent manifestation patterns, requiring different mitigation
strategies for small versus large games. Our proposed Robust Deep MCCFR
framework incorporates target networks with delayed updates, uniform
exploration mixing, variance-aware training objectives, and comprehensive
diagnostic monitoring. Through systematic ablation studies on Kuhn and Leduc
Poker, we demonstrate scale-dependent component effectiveness and identify
critical component interactions. The best configuration achieves final
exploitability of 0.0628 on Kuhn Poker, representing a 60% improvement over the
classical framework (0.156). On the more complex Leduc Poker domain, selective
component usage achieves exploitability of 0.2386, a 23.5% improvement over the
classical framework (0.3703) and highlighting the importance of careful
component selection over comprehensive mitigation. Our contributions include:
(1) a formal theoretical analysis of risks in neural MCCFR, (2) a principled
mitigation framework with convergence guarantees, (3) comprehensive multi-scale
experimental validation revealing scale-dependent component interactions, and
(4) practical guidelines for deployment in larger games.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型评估基准缺乏可控性和可扩展性，无法进行多维度系统分析和训练，问题类型和格式也比较单一，需要一种新的工具来系统评估和增强LLM的逻辑推理能力。

Method: SATQuest从合取范式(CNF)实例生成多样化的可满足性逻辑推理问题，沿着三个正交维度（实例规模、问题类型、问题格式）构建问题，采用随机化的基于SAT的问题生成和通过PySAT进行客观答案验证。

Result: 对各种LLM的广泛评估发现它们在逻辑推理方面存在显著局限性，特别是在超越熟悉的数学格式进行泛化方面。使用SATQuest奖励进行强化微调显著提高了目标任务性能，并能泛化到更复杂的实例。

Conclusion: SATQuest展示了作为基础工具的潜力，是推进LLM逻辑推理能力的宝贵起点，同时突显了跨格式适应方面仍然存在的挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
general reasoning capabilities. However, systematically evaluating and
enhancing these reasoning capabilities is challenging due to the lack of
controllable and scalable tools for fine-grained analysis. Existing benchmarks
and datasets often lack the necessary variable control for multi-dimensional,
systematic analysis and training, or have narrow problem types and formats. To
address these limitations, we introduce SATQuest, a systematic verifier
designed to evaluate and enhance logical reasoning in LLMs by generating
diverse, Satisfiability-based logical reasoning problems directly from
Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) instances. SATQuest structures these problems
along three orthogonal dimensions: instance scale, problem type, and question
format, employing randomized, SAT-based problem generation and objective answer
verification via PySAT. This design mitigates memorization issues, allows for
nuanced insights into reasoning performance, and enables effective
reinforcement fine-tuning. Our extensive evaluation of various LLMs using
SATQuest identified significant limitations in their logical reasoning,
particularly in generalizing beyond familiar mathematical formats. Furthermore,
we show that reinforcement fine-tuning with SATQuest rewards substantially
improves targeted task performance and generalizes to more complex instances,
while highlighting remaining challenges in cross-format adaptation. Through
these demonstrations, we showcase SATQuest's potential as a foundational tool
and a valuable starting point for advancing LLM logical reasoning.

Abstract: Cities today generate enormous streams of data from sensors, cameras, and
connected infrastructure. While this information offers unprecedented
opportunities to improve urban life, most existing systems struggle with scale,
latency, and fragmented insights. This work introduces a framework that blends
physics-informed machine learning, multimodal data fusion, and knowledge graph
representation with adaptive, rule-based intelligence powered by large language
models (LLMs). Physics-informed methods ground learning in real-world
constraints, ensuring predictions remain meaningful and consistent with
physical dynamics. Knowledge graphs act as the semantic backbone, integrating
heterogeneous sensor data into a connected, queryable structure. At the edge,
LLMs generate context-aware rules that adapt filtering and decision-making in
real time, enabling efficient operation even under constrained resources.
Together, these elements form a foundation for digital twin systems that go
beyond passive monitoring to provide actionable insights. By uniting
physics-based reasoning, semantic data fusion, and adaptive rule generation,
this approach opens new possibilities for creating responsive, trustworthy, and
sustainable smart infrastructures.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel, multi stage hybrid intelligence framework for
pruning patent portfolios to identify high value assets for technology
transfer. Current patent valuation methods often rely on retrospective
indicators or manual, time intensive analysis. Our framework automates and
deepens this process by combining a Learning to Rank (LTR) model, which
evaluates patents against over 30 legal and commercial parameters, with a
unique "Need-Seed" agent-based system. The "Need Agent" uses Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to mine unstructured market and industry data, identifying
explicit technological needs. Concurrently, the "Seed Agent" employs fine tuned
Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze patent claims and map their
technological capabilities. The system generates a "Core Ontology Framework"
that matches high potential patents (Seeds) to documented market demands
(Needs), providing a strategic rationale for divestment decisions. We detail
the architecture, including a dynamic parameter weighting system and a crucial
Human in the-Loop (HITL) validation protocol, to ensure both adaptability and
real-world credibility.

systematic evaluation using multiple LLM judges and human validation, we
demonstrate that LENS generates superior explanations compared to direct LLM
prompting and hand-crafted templates. To investigate whether LENS can teach
transferable active learning strategies, we carried out a human learning
experiment across three related domains. Our results show no significant human
performance improvements, suggesting that comprehensive LLM responses may
overwhelm users for simpler problems rather than providing learning support.
Our work provides a solid foundation for building effective USML systems to
support human learning. The source code is available on:

TL;DR: CoreThink是一个基于通用符号推理方法的新型推理层，在工具调用、代码生成和规划等任务上实现了最先进性能，无需微调或训练成本即可提升模型推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如测试时扩展、监督微调和强化学习在LLM性能提升上会出现收益递减，需要开发新的推理技术来突破性能瓶颈。

Method: 采用通用符号推理方法（General Symbolics），构建CoreThink通用符号推理器，专门针对工具调用、代码生成和规划三个关键用例进行优化。

Result: 在7个基准测试中表现优异：Livecodebench v6达到66.66%、指令跟随评估89%、ARC-AGI-2达到24.4%，基于该技术开发的智能编程IDE在SWE-Bench Lite上达到62.3%的准确率。

Conclusion: CoreThink推理层能够在不产生负面影响的情况下纯提升模型推理性能，为解决现有方法收益递减问题提供了新的技术路径，适用于推理密集型应用场景。

Abstract: We introduce CoreThink, a state-of-the-art Reasoning Layer built upon a novel
reasoning method called General Symbolics. This approach diverges from
reasoning paradigms such as test-time scaling, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). CoreThink General
Symbolic Reasoner (GSR) is specifically structured around three key use cases:
tool-calling, code generation, and planning, demonstrating exemplary
performance across a total of seven benchmarks in their respective areas.
Notably, we are achieving SOTA scores of 66.66\% on Livecodebench v6, 89\% on
Instruction-Following Evals, and 24.4\% on ARC-AGI-2. We also present an
agentic coding IDE, developed using the principles of General Symbolics, which
achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 62.3\% on \texttt{SWE-Bench Lite}. We
are able to achieve these improvements without any finetuning or training
costs. Our Reasoning Layer is designed to provide a pure performance uplift,
ensuring that a model's accuracy on reasoning tasks is never negatively
impacted. We argue that incumbent methods will eventually lead to diminishing
returns in LLM performance, necessitating the development of new reasoning
techniques. This technical report details our approach at a high level and the
availability of the CoreThink models for reasoning-intensive use cases.

TL;DR: ReaL-TG是一个基于强化学习的框架，通过微调大语言模型在时序图上进行可解释的链接预测，使用结果奖励机制鼓励模型从图结构中探索推理策略并生成解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时序图神经网络虽然性能强大但缺乏可解释性，且无法直接应用于未见过的图。现有的大语言模型图推理研究多局限于静态图或小型合成时序图，且缺乏对推理轨迹质量的评估。

Method: 提出ReaL-TG强化学习框架，使用结果奖励微调大语言模型，让模型从图结构中自主探索推理策略，生成直接支持预测的解释。同时提出结合排序指标和LLM-as-a-Judge系统的评估协议。

Result: 实验显示，基于Qwen3-4B微调的ReaL-TG-4B在排序指标上优于包括GPT-5 mini在内的更大规模前沿大语言模型，生成的解释质量得到LLM评判系统和人工评估的确认。

Conclusion: ReaL-TG框架成功实现了在真实世界时序图上的可解释链接预测，通过强化学习微调使较小模型在性能和解释质量上都超越了更大规模的模型。

Abstract: Forecasting future links is a central task in temporal graph (TG) reasoning,
requiring models to leverage historical interactions to predict upcoming ones.
Traditional neural approaches, such as temporal graph neural networks, achieve
strong performance but lack explainability and cannot be applied to unseen
graphs without retraining. Recent studies have begun to explore using large
language models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to
static graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of
reasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced
Learning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that
fine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs.
ReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning
strategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly
justify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning
traces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an
LLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the
impact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning
Qwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier
LLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality
explanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various reasoning and generation tasks. However, their proficiency in complex
causal reasoning, discovery, and estimation remains an area of active
development, often hindered by issues like hallucination, reliance on spurious
correlations, and difficulties in handling nuanced, domain-specific, or
personalized causal relationships. Multi-agent systems, leveraging the
collaborative or specialized abilities of multiple LLM-based agents, are
emerging as a powerful paradigm to address these limitations. This review paper
explores the burgeoning field of causal multi-agent LLMs. We examine how these
systems are designed to tackle different facets of causality, including causal
reasoning and counterfactual analysis, causal discovery from data, and the
estimation of causal effects. We delve into the diverse architectural patterns
and interaction protocols employed, from pipeline-based processing and debate
frameworks to simulation environments and iterative refinement loops.
Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation methodologies, benchmarks, and diverse
application domains where causal multi-agent LLMs are making an impact,
including scientific discovery, healthcare, fact-checking, and personalized
systems. Finally, we highlight the persistent challenges, open research
questions, and promising future directions in this synergistic field, aiming to
provide a comprehensive overview of its current state and potential trajectory.

Motivation: LLM代理在数据操作中采用高吞吐量的探索和解决方案形成过程（代理性推测），对现有数据系统构成挑战，需要数据系统更原生地支持代理工作负载。

Method: 分析代理性推测的四大特征：规模、异构性、冗余性和可控性，并基于这些特征提出代理优先的数据系统架构研究机遇。

Result: 识别了一系列新的研究方向，包括新查询接口、新查询处理技术和新代理内存存储等。

Conclusion: 数据系统需要根本性重构来更好地支持LLM代理工作负载，以满足代理性推测的特殊需求。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, acting on their users' behalf to
manipulate and analyze data, are likely to become the dominant workload for
data systems in the future. When working with data, agents employ a
high-throughput process of exploration and solution formulation for the given
task, one we call agentic speculation. The sheer volume and inefficiencies of
agentic speculation can pose challenges for present-day data systems. We argue
that data systems need to adapt to more natively support agentic workloads. We
take advantage of the characteristics of agentic speculation that we identify,
i.e., scale, heterogeneity, redundancy, and steerability - to outline a number
of new research opportunities for a new agent-first data systems architecture,
ranging from new query interfaces, to new query processing techniques, to new
agentic memory stores.

Abstract: Inductive reasoning enables humans to infer abstract rules from limited
examples and apply them to novel situations. In this work, we compare an
LLM-based hypothesis search framework with direct program generation approaches
on few-shot rule induction tasks. Our findings show that hypothesis search
achieves performance comparable to humans, while direct program generation
falls notably behind. An error analysis reveals key bottlenecks in hypothesis
generation and suggests directions for advancing program induction methods.
Overall, this paper underscores the potential of LLM-based hypothesis search
for modeling inductive reasoning and the challenges in building more efficient
systems.

Abstract: By uncovering the contrast between Artificial Intelligence and Natural-born
Intelligence as a computational process, we define closed computing and open
computing, and implement open computing within chemical reactions. This
involves forming a mixture and invalidation of the computational process and
the execution environment, which are logically distinct, and coalescing both to
create a system that adjusts fluctuations. We model chemical reactions by
considering the computation as the chemical reaction and the execution
environment as the degree of aggregation of molecules that interact with the
reactive environment. This results in a chemical reaction that progresses while
repeatedly clustering and de-clustering, where concentration no longer holds
significant meaning. Open computing is segmented into Token computing, which
focuses on the individual behavior of chemical molecules, and Type computing,
which focuses on normative behavior. Ultimately, both are constructed as an
interplay between the two. In this system, Token computing demonstrates
self-organizing critical phenomena, while Type computing exhibits quantum
logic. Through their interplay, the recruitment of fluctuations is realized,
giving rise to interactions between quantum logical subspaces corresponding to
quantum coherence across different Hilbert spaces. As a result, spike waves are
formed, enabling signal transmission. This occurrence may be termed
quantum-like coherence, implying the source of enzymes responsible for
controlling spike waves and biochemical rhythms.

five search-based solution algorithms, leveraging joint configuration space
search, classical planning, multi-agent pathfinding, and expert heuristics. We
evaluate the five approaches empirically for plan quality and scalability.
Despite the exponential relation between search space size and block number,
our methods demonstrate efficiency in creating rearrangement plans for deeply
buried blocks in up to 80x80 grids.

Abstract: GUI agents powered by LLMs show promise in interacting with diverse digital
environments. Among these, video games offer a valuable testbed due to their
varied interfaces, with adventure games posing additional challenges through
complex, narrative-driven interactions. Existing game benchmarks, however, lack
diversity and rarely evaluate agents on completing entire storylines. To
address this, we introduce FlashAdventure, a benchmark of 34 Flash-based
adventure games designed to test full story arc completion and tackle the
observation-behavior gap: the challenge of remembering and acting on earlier
gameplay information. We also propose CUA-as-a-Judge, an automated gameplay
evaluator, and COAST, an agentic framework leveraging long-term clue memory to
better plan and solve sequential tasks. Experiments show current GUI agents
struggle with full story arcs, while COAST improves milestone completion by
bridging the observation-behavior gap. Nonetheless, a marked discrepancy
between humans and best-performing agents warrants continued research efforts
to narrow this divide.

Motivation: 现有的工具增强强化学习方法存在代码库碎片化、同步执行瓶颈和跨领域扩展性有限的问题，阻碍了社区采用和算法创新，需要统一的框架来解决这些效率问题。

Method: 提出VerlTool框架，包含四个核心设计：与VeRL的上游对齐、标准化API的统一工具管理、异步rollout执行消除同步瓶颈，以及模块化插件架构支持快速工具集成。

Result: 在数学推理、知识问答、SQL生成、视觉推理、网络搜索和软件工程等6个ARLT领域实现竞争性性能，异步执行获得近2倍加速，同时提供统一的训练基础设施。

Conclusion: VerlTool为工具增强的强化学习研究提供了可扩展的基础设施，通过系统化设计原则解决了现有方法的局限性，支持多模态观察和多轮交互，显著降低了开发开销。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated
success in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to
single-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic
Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address
multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases
that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited
extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community
adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and
modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design
principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment
with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool
management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code
execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous
rollout execution achieving near 2$\times$ speedup by eliminating
synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating
competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as
multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video),
extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on
mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web
search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to
specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The
modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only
lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and
providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research. Our code is

Conclusion: Robix成功实现了机器人推理、任务规划和自然语言交互的统一，为构建更智能、更自然的机器人系统提供了有效的端到端解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Robix, a unified model that integrates robot reasoning, task
planning, and natural language interaction within a single vision-language
architecture. Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot
system, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level
controller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to
follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally
with human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel
capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and
context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix
leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training
strategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning
abilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and
task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot
interaction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3)
reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon
task coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both
open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in
interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse
instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and
interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商平台中产品列表的SKU匹配是一个长期挑战，特别是当缺乏明确标识符且产品名称在不同平台差异很大时。传统的基于规则和关键词相似度的方法容易忽略品牌、规格或套装配置的细微差别而导致误分类。

Method: 提出Q2K多智能体框架：1）推理智能体生成针对性消歧问题；2）知识智能体通过聚焦网络搜索解决问题；3）去重智能体重用已验证的推理轨迹以减少冗余并确保一致性。还包含人工干预机制来优化不确定情况。

Result: 在真实消费品数据集上的实验表明，Q2K超越了强基线方法，在困难场景（如套装识别和品牌来源消歧）中实现了更高的准确性和鲁棒性。通过重用检索到的推理而非重复搜索，Q2K在准确性和效率之间取得了平衡。

Conclusion: Q2K提供了一个可扩展且可解释的产品集成解决方案，通过多智能体LLM框架有效解决了SKU映射问题，在保持高效率的同时显著提升了匹配准确性。

Abstract: Identifying whether two product listings refer to the same Stock Keeping Unit
(SKU) is a persistent challenge in ecommerce, especially when explicit
identifiers are missing and product names vary widely across platforms. Rule
based heuristics and keyword similarity often misclassify products by
overlooking subtle distinctions in brand, specification, or bundle
configuration. To overcome these limitations, we propose Question to Knowledge
(Q2K), a multi agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for
reliable SKU mapping. Q2K integrates: (1) a Reasoning Agent that generates
targeted disambiguation questions, (2) a Knowledge Agent that resolves them via
focused web searches, and (3) a Deduplication Agent that reuses validated
reasoning traces to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency. A human in the
loop mechanism further refines uncertain cases. Experiments on real world
consumer goods datasets show that Q2K surpasses strong baselines, achieving
higher accuracy and robustness in difficult scenarios such as bundle
identification and brand origin disambiguation. By reusing retrieved reasoning
instead of issuing repeated searches, Q2K balances accuracy with efficiency,
offering a scalable and interpretable solution for product integration.

Motivation: 现有基于知识图谱的检索增强生成方法通常假设锚点实体可访问来启动图遍历，这在开放世界环境中不可靠，因为查询与实体之间的准确链接往往不可靠，限制了方法的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出AnchorRAG多智能体协作框架：预测器智能体动态识别候选锚点实体，检索器智能体并行进行多跳探索，监督器智能体制定迭代检索策略并综合知识路径生成最终答案。

Result: 在四个公共基准测试上的广泛实验表明，AnchorRAG显著优于现有基线方法，在真实世界问答任务上建立了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: AnchorRAG通过多智能体协作有效解决了开放世界检索增强生成中的锚点实体依赖问题，提高了检索鲁棒性，减少了模糊或错误锚点的影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
language understanding and reasoning. However, their dependence on static
training corpora makes them prone to factual errors and knowledge gaps.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating
external knowledge sources, especially structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which
provide explicit semantics and efficient retrieval. Existing KG-based RAG
approaches, however, generally assume that anchor entities are accessible to
initiate graph traversal, which limits their robustness in open world settings
where accurate linking between the query and the entity is unreliable. To
overcome this limitation, we propose AnchorRAG, a novel multi-agent
collaboration framework for open-world RAG without the predefined anchor
entities. Specifically, a predictor agent dynamically identifies candidate
anchor entities by aligning user query terms with KG nodes and initializes
independent retriever agents to conduct parallel multi-hop explorations from
each candidate. Then a supervisor agent formulates the iterative retrieval
strategy for these retriever agents and synthesizes the resulting knowledge
paths to generate the final answer. This multi-agent collaboration framework
improves retrieval robustness and mitigates the impact of ambiguous or
erroneous anchors. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate
that AnchorRAG significantly outperforms existing baselines and establishes new
state-of-the-art results on the real-world question answering tasks.

Method: 采用Model Context Protocol服务器架构，包含工作负载分析引擎、调度策略库和执行验证器，通过多智能体系统自主分析工作负载并合成eBPF调度策略。

Result: 实现了最高1.79倍的性能提升，相比朴素智能体方法成本降低13倍，同时保持高成功率。

Conclusion: SchedCP通过弥合语义鸿沟，使专家级系统优化民主化，为创建真正自优化的应用感知操作系统迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Operating system schedulers suffer from a fundamental semantic gap, where
kernel policies fail to understand application-specific needs, leading to
suboptimal performance. We introduce SchedCP, the first framework that enables
fully autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents to safely and efficiently
optimize Linux schedulers without human involvement. Our core insight is that
the challenge is not merely to apply a better LLM, but to architect a decoupled
control plane that separates the AI's role of semantic reasoning ("what to
optimize") from the system's role of execution ("how to observe and act").
Implemented as Model Context Protocol(MCP) server, SchedCP provides a stable
interface with three key services: a Workload Analysis Engine, an evolving
Scheduler Policy Repository, and an Execution Verifier that validates all
AI-generated code and configure before deployment with static and dynamic
analysis.
  We demonstrate this architecture's power with sched-agent, a multi-agent
system that autonomously analyzes workloads, synthesizes custom eBPF scheduling
policies, and deploys them via the sched\_ext infrastructure. Our evaluation
shows that SchedCP achieves up to an 1.79x performance improvement, and a 13x
cost reduction compared to naive agentic approaches, all while maintaining high
success rate. By bridging the semantic gap, SchedCP democratizes expert-level
system optimization and represents a step towards creating truly
self-optimizing, application-aware operating systems. The code is open-sourced

TL;DR: VGTeam是一个基于大语言模型的幻灯片视频生成系统，通过多智能体协作显著降低计算成本，实现高效、低成本的视频生成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本到视频模型计算成本高昂，需要开发更高效、低成本的视频生成解决方案

Method: 采用多智能体协作架构，模拟传统视频制作流程，包括脚本编写、场景创建和音频设计等模块，通过聊天塔工作流实现协作

Result: 系统平均生成成本仅0.103美元，成功生成率达98.4%，同时保持高创意保真度和定制化能力

Conclusion: VGTeam通过语言模型在创意领域的应用，实现了视频制作的民主化，为下一代内容创作提供了开创性解决方案

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), the proliferation
of AI-generated content (AIGC) tasks has significantly accelerated developments
in text-to-video generation. As a result, the field of video production is
undergoing a transformative shift. However, conventional text-to-video models
are typically constrained by high computational costs.
  In this study, we propose Video-Generation-Team (VGTeam), a novel slide show
video generation system designed to redefine the video creation pipeline
through the integration of large language models (LLMs). VGTeam is composed of
a suite of communicative agents, each responsible for a distinct aspect of
video generation, such as scriptwriting, scene creation, and audio design.
These agents operate collaboratively within a chat tower workflow, transforming
user-provided textual prompts into coherent, slide-style narrative videos.
  By emulating the sequential stages of traditional video production, VGTeam
achieves remarkable improvements in both efficiency and scalability, while
substantially reducing computational overhead. On average, the system generates
videos at a cost of only $0.103, with a successful generation rate of 98.4%.
Importantly, this framework maintains a high degree of creative fidelity and
customization.
  The implications of VGTeam are far-reaching. It democratizes video production
by enabling broader access to high-quality content creation without the need
for extensive resources. Furthermore, it highlights the transformative
potential of language models in creative domains and positions VGTeam as a
pioneering system for next-generation content creation.

TL;DR: 本文评估了结果奖励模型(ORMs)在Text-to-SQL任务中作为BoN启发式方法的效果，相比传统的执行BoN和多数投票方法，ORMs在BIRD和Spider基准上实现了显著的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在生成复杂SQL查询时仍难以精确对齐用户意图和数据库模式，现有的测试时策略如BoN和多数投票依赖表面启发式方法，而基于语义正确性的ORMs方法在Text-to-SQL任务中尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出了训练Text-to-SQL任务ORMs的框架，在BIRD和SPIDER基准上微调多个开源LLMs（Qwen2、Granite3、Llama3等），评估ORMs作为BoN启发式的效果。

Result: ORMs在BIRD上比ex-BoN提升4.33%，比Maj提升2.91%；在Spider上比ex-BoN提升2.10%，比Maj提升0.93%。对已对齐SQL生成的模型（如OmniSQL）微调可获得更优的ORM性能。

Conclusion: ORMs是Text-to-SQL任务中优于传统测试时策略的有效方法，特别是在复杂查询和更多候选查询的情况下表现更佳，为提升LLMs的SQL生成准确性提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL, the task of translating natural language questions into SQL
queries, has significantly advanced with the introduction of Large Language
Models (LLMs), broadening database accessibility for a wide range of users.
Despite substantial progress in generating valid SQL, current LLMs still
struggle with complex queries that require precise alignment between user
intent and the database schema. To mitigate this, test-time strategies such as
Best-of-N (BoN) and Majority Voting (Maj) are often employed, based on the
assumption that LLMs can generate correct answers but may require multiple
attempts. However, these methods rely on surface-level heuristics, selecting
either the syntactically correct query through execution-based BoN (ex-BoN) or
the most frequently generated query with Maj. Recently, Outcome Reward Models
(ORMs), which assign utility scores to generated outputs based on semantic
correctness, have emerged as a promising approach for better aligning model
predictions with user intent. Nevertheless, their application to Text-to-SQL
remains largely underexplored.
  In this work, we evaluate ORMs as an effective heuristic for BoN, compare
them with ex-BoN and Maj, and introduce a framework for training ORMs for the
Text-to-SQL task. We evaluate our ORMs on the BIRD and SPIDER benchmarks,
finetuning various open-source LLMs, including the Qwen2, Granite3, and Llama3
model families. Our results show that ORMs outperform ex-BoN and Maj, achieving
execution accuracy gains of +4.33% (BIRD) and +2.10% (Spider) over ex-BoN, and
+2.91% (BIRD) and +0.93% (Spider) over Maj. We further demonstrate that
finetuning models already aligned with SQL generation, such as OmniSQL, yields
superior ORM performance. Additionally, we observe that ORMs achieve
competitive results on simple queries and benefit more from an increased number
of candidates compared to ex-BoN and Maj.

TL;DR: GenQPM是一种基于深度生成模型的定量预测监测方法，通过模式分类和保形推理为多模态随机系统提供统计保证的模式特异性预测区间，相比模式不可知方法显著提高了信息量和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有定量预测监测方法在处理多模态动态系统时过于保守，无法提供有意义的模式特异性满意度信息，需要一种能够有效处理多模态动态的方法。

Method: 使用基于分数的扩散模型等深度生成模型近似系统概率多模态动态，通过模式分类器对预测轨迹进行模式划分，对每个模式应用保形推理生成统计有效的模式特异性预测区间。

Result: 在智能体导航和自动驾驶任务基准测试中，GenQPM产生的预测区间比模式不可知基线方法显著更信息丰富（更不保守）。

Conclusion: GenQPM方法成功解决了多模态动态系统的定量预测监测问题，通过模式特异性分析提供了更精确和有用的预测信息。

Abstract: We consider the problem of quantitative predictive monitoring (QPM) of
stochastic systems, i.e., predicting at runtime the degree of satisfaction of a
desired temporal logic property from the current state of the system. Since
computational efficiency is key to enable timely intervention against predicted
violations, several state-of-the-art QPM approaches rely on fast
machine-learning surrogates to provide prediction intervals for the
satisfaction values, using conformal inference to offer statistical guarantees.
However, these QPM methods suffer when the monitored agent exhibits multi-modal
dynamics, whereby certain modes may yield high satisfaction values while others
critically violate the property. Existing QPM methods are mode-agnostic and so
would yield overly conservative and uninformative intervals that lack
meaningful mode-specific satisfaction information. To address this problem, we
present GenQPM, a method that leverages deep generative models, specifically
score-based diffusion models, to reliably approximate the probabilistic and
multi-modal system dynamics without requiring explicit model access. GenQPM
employs a mode classifier to partition the predicted trajectories by dynamical
mode. For each mode, we then apply conformal inference to produce statistically
valid, mode-specific prediction intervals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
GenQPM on a benchmark of agent navigation and autonomous driving tasks,
resulting in prediction intervals that are significantly more informative (less
conservative) than mode-agnostic baselines.

TL;DR: 提出无需额外训练的CAD零件检索框架，通过错误笔记本+RAG方法提升现有通用模型在复杂CAD装配体中的规格感知检索性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接使用LLMs/VLMs进行CAD零件检索面临输入序列超长、性能不佳的问题，且微调需要大量计算资源，对专有模型不可行

Method: 构建错误笔记本收集历史错误思维链，通过反思修正连接至正确解；使用RAG检索规格相关记录并融入推理过程

Result: 在GPT-4o和Gemini系列模型上实现显著提升，GPT-4o Omni在人类偏好数据集上绝对准确率提升23.4%

Conclusion: 该框架能有效处理具有冗长非自然语言元数据的3D模型，特别在零件数量较多(>10)的挑战性案例中，思维链推理优势明显

Abstract: Effective specification-aware part retrieval within complex CAD assemblies is
essential for automated design verification and downstream engineering tasks.
However, directly using LLMs/VLMs to this task presents some challenges: the
input sequences may exceed model token limits, and even after processing,
performance remains unsatisfactory. Moreover, fine-tuning LLMs/VLMs requires
significant computational resources, and for many high-performing general-use
proprietary models (e.g., GPT or Gemini), fine-tuning access is not available.
In this paper, we propose a novel part retrieval framework that requires no
extra training, but using Error Notebooks + RAG for refined prompt engineering
to help improve the existing general model's retrieval performance. The
construction of Error Notebooks consists of two steps: (1) collecting
historical erroneous CoTs and their incorrect answers, and (2) connecting these
CoTs through reflective corrections until the correct solutions are obtained.
As a result, the Error Notebooks serve as a repository of tasks along with
their corrected CoTs and final answers. RAG is then employed to retrieve
specification-relevant records from the Error Notebooks and incorporate them
into the inference process. Another major contribution of our work is a
human-in-the-loop CAD dataset, which is used to evaluate our method. In
addition, the engineering value of our novel framework lies in its ability to
effectively handle 3D models with lengthy, non-natural language metadata.
Experiments with proprietary models, including GPT-4o and the Gemini series,
show substantial gains, with GPT-4o (Omni) achieving up to a 23.4% absolute
accuracy improvement on the human preference dataset. Moreover, ablation
studies confirm that CoT reasoning provides benefits especially in challenging
cases with higher part counts (>10).

Motivation: 当前深度研究代理评估面临挑战，难以收集真正反映研究者关注和智力好奇心的前沿研究问题。现有评估方法无法真实反映现实研究环境，且存在数据泄露风险。

Method: 提出多智能体分层任务生成(MAHTG)系统，从研讨会转录中提取研究价值灵感，并将其转化为高质量研究任务，确保任务制定的可追溯性并过滤噪声。

Result: 构建了包含10,000+研究任务的DeepResearch Arena基准，涵盖12个学科。评估显示该基准对当前最先进代理构成显著挑战，不同模型间存在明显性能差距。

Conclusion: DeepResearch Arena提供了一个更真实、更全面的深度研究代理评估框架，能够更好地反映现实研究环境，为未来研究代理的发展提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Deep research agents have attracted growing attention for their potential to
orchestrate multi-stage research workflows, spanning literature synthesis,
methodological design, and empirical verification. Despite these strides,
evaluating their research capability faithfully is rather challenging due to
the difficulty of collecting frontier research questions that genuinely capture
researchers' attention and intellectual curiosity. To address this gap, we
introduce DeepResearch Arena, a benchmark grounded in academic seminars that
capture rich expert discourse and interaction, better reflecting real-world
research environments and reducing the risk of data leakage. To automatically
construct DeepResearch Arena, we propose a Multi-Agent Hierarchical Task
Generation (MAHTG) system that extracts research-worthy inspirations from
seminar transcripts. The MAHTG system further translates research-worthy
inspirations into high-quality research tasks, ensuring the traceability of
research task formulation while filtering noise. With the MAHTG system, we
curate DeepResearch Arena with over 10,000 high-quality research tasks from
over 200 academic seminars, spanning 12 disciplines, such as literature,
history, and science. Our extensive evaluation shows that DeepResearch Arena
presents substantial challenges for current state-of-the-art agents, with clear
performance gaps observed across different models.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the practice of science. Machine
learning and large language models (LLMs) can generate hypotheses at a scale
and speed far exceeding traditional methods, offering the potential to
accelerate discovery across diverse fields. However, the abundance of
hypotheses introduces a critical challenge: without scalable and reliable
mechanisms for verification, scientific progress risks being hindered rather
than being advanced. In this article, we trace the historical development of
scientific discovery, examine how AI is reshaping established practices for
scientific discovery, and review the principal approaches, ranging from
data-driven methods and knowledge-aware neural architectures to symbolic
reasoning frameworks and LLM agents. While these systems can uncover patterns
and propose candidate laws, their scientific value ultimately depends on
rigorous and transparent verification, which we argue must be the cornerstone
of AI-assisted discovery.

Result: 在ProgrammableWeb数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够更高效地生成更准确的场景，为服务生态系统治理实验系统构建提供了创新方法

Conclusion: 该研究提出的多代理协同场景生成方法有效解决了传统方法的局限性，为复杂社会环境下的服务生态系统治理提供了可靠的实验支撑

Abstract: As the social environment is growing more complex and collaboration is
deepening, factors affecting the healthy development of service ecosystem are
constantly changing and diverse, making its governance a crucial research
issue. Applying the scenario analysis method and conducting scenario rehearsals
by constructing an experimental system before managers make decisions, losses
caused by wrong decisions can be largely avoided. However, it relies on
predefined rules to construct scenarios and faces challenges such as limited
information, a large number of influencing factors, and the difficulty of
measuring social elements. These challenges limit the quality and efficiency of
generating social and uncertain scenarios for the service ecosystem. Therefore,
we propose a scenario generator design method, which adaptively coordinates
three Large Language Model (LLM) empowered agents that autonomously optimize
experimental schemes to construct an experimental system and generate high
quality scenarios. Specifically, the Environment Agent (EA) generates social
environment including extremes, the Social Agent (SA) generates social
collaboration structure, and the Planner Agent (PA) couples task-role
relationships and plans task solutions. These agents work in coordination, with
the PA adjusting the experimental scheme in real time by perceiving the states
of each agent and these generating scenarios. Experiments on the
ProgrammableWeb dataset illustrate our method generates more accurate scenarios
more efficiently, and innovatively provides an effective way for service
ecosystem governance related experimental system construction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization (CSR)训练方法，通过在训练时引入算子级反事实干预来增强语言模型推理过程的忠实性，仅需每个样本一次额外前向传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常在产生正确答案的同时依赖有缺陷或不相关的推理轨迹，这在高风险领域中削弱了其可信度。需要确保中间推理与最终输出之间的依赖关系。

Method: CSR方法在训练过程中引入自动化的算子级反事实干预（如将"+"替换为"-"），并惩罚在逻辑无效轨迹下保持相同答案的模型。同时提出了Counterfactual Outcome Sensitivity (COS)指标来量化扰动对预测的影响。

Result: 在算术推理(GSM8K)、逻辑推理(PrOntoQA)和规划(Blocks World)任务上，CSR相比标准微调和过程监督方法将忠实性提高了高达70个百分点，仅带来轻微准确率损失。学到的敏感性可泛化到更大模型并与自洽等推理时方法协同工作。

Conclusion: CSR是一种轻量级的训练目标，能有效增强语言模型推理过程的忠实性，且该方法可扩展到语义扰动以提升常识推理的忠实性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce correct answers while relying on
flawed or irrelevant reasoning traces, undermining their trustworthiness in
high-stakes domains. We propose Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization
(CSR), a lightweight training objective that enforces dependence between
intermediate reasoning and final outputs. CSR introduces automated,
operator-level counterfactual interventions (e.g., swapping "+" with "-")
during training and penalizes models that preserve the same answer under
logically invalid traces. This requires only one additional forward pass per
sample. To measure faithfulness, we introduce Counterfactual Outcome
Sensitivity (COS), which quantifies the impact of such perturbations on model
predictions. Across structured reasoning tasks - arithmetic (GSM8K), logical
deduction (PrOntoQA), and planning (Blocks World) - CSR improves faithfulness
by up to 70 percentage points over standard fine-tuning and process
supervision, with only minor accuracy loss. The learned sensitivity generalizes
to larger models and synergizes with inference-time methods such as
self-consistency. A pilot study on HellaSwag further demonstrates that
extending CSR with semantic perturbations can enhance faithfulness in
commonsense reasoning.

Conclusion: 该结构化决策框架展示了在安全关键环境中构建更可靠自主AI应用的潜力，为负责任AI的发展提供了重要基础。

Abstract: With artificial intelligence (AI) being applied to bring autonomy to
decision-making in safety-critical domains such as the ones typified in the
aerospace and emergency-response services, there has been a call to address the
ethical implications of structuring those decisions, so they remain reliable
and justifiable when human lives are at stake. This paper contributes to
addressing the challenge of decision-making by proposing a structured
decision-making framework as a foundational step towards responsible AI. The
proposed structured decision-making framework is implemented in autonomous
decision-making, specifically within disaster management. By introducing
concepts of Enabler agents, Levels and Scenarios, the proposed framework's
performance is evaluated against systems relying solely on judgement-based
insights, as well as human operators who have disaster experience: victims,
volunteers, and stakeholders. The results demonstrate that the structured
decision-making framework achieves 60.94% greater stability in consistently
accurate decisions across multiple Scenarios, compared to judgement-based
systems. Moreover, the study shows that the proposed framework outperforms
human operators with a 38.93% higher accuracy across various Scenarios. These
findings demonstrate the promise of the structured decision-making framework
for building more reliable autonomous AI applications in safety-critical
contexts.

<details>

Motivation: 随着AI网络代理的快速发展，它们可能会过载内容提供商、突破CAPTCHA防护系统，或者创建大量假账户。内容提供商需要保护服务免受拒绝服务攻击和爬虫。

Method: 设计了一种可调整成本的框架，通过重识问题（rebus-based Reasoning Gates）来制约代理。这些合成文本谜题需要多跳推理和世界知识，从而大大增加代理生成响应的代价（token生成成本）。

Result: 该框架实现了计算不对称性，响应生成成本比SOTA模型的生成成本高出9.2倍。在自定义网站和MCP服务器上部署并通过真实网络代理进行了评估。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种有效的方法来通过增加计算成本来制约AI网络代理，但也讨论了实际部署的限制和环境影响。

Abstract: AI web agents use Internet resources at far greater speed, scale, and
complexity -- changing how users and services interact. Deployed maliciously or
erroneously, these agents could overload content providers. At the same time,
web agents can bypass CAPTCHAs and other defenses by mimicking user behavior or
flood authentication systems with fake accounts. Yet providers must protect
their services and content from denial-of-service attacks and scraping by web
agents. In this paper, we design a framework that imposes tunable costs on
agents before providing access to resources; we call this Web Agent Throttling.
We start by formalizing Throttling Gates as challenges issued to an agent that
are asymmetric, scalable, robust, and compatible with any agent. Focusing on a
common component -- the language model -- we require the agent to solve
reasoning puzzles, thereby incurring excessive token-generation costs. However,
we find that using existing puzzles, e.g., coding or math, as throttling gates
fails to satisfy our properties. To address this, we introduce rebus-based
Reasoning Gates, synthetic text puzzles that require multi-hop reasoning over
world knowledge (thereby throttling an agent's model). We design a scalable
generation and verification protocol for such reasoning gates. Our framework
achieves computational asymmetry, i.e., the response-generation cost is 9.2x
higher than the generation cost for SOTA models. We further deploy reasoning
gates on a custom website and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and evaluate
with real-world web agents. Finally, we discuss the limitations and
environmental impact of real-world deployment of our framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在各种应用中的广泛使用，存在用户试图利用这些模型进行恶意目的（如合成受控物质和传播虚假信息）的担忧，即"越狱"攻击。现有防御方法虽然有效，但其基本原理仍不明确。

Method: 提出新颖的神经元级别可解释性方法，将模型内部表示投影到更一致和可解释的词汇空间，识别安全相关知识神经元，并通过调整这些神经元的激活来控制模型行为。基于此开发了SafeTuning微调策略来强化安全关键神经元。

Result: 调整安全相关神经元激活可有效控制模型行为，平均攻击成功率（ASR）高于97%。SafeTuning在多个LLMs上一致降低攻击成功率，并优于所有四个基线防御方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为理解和防御越狱攻击提供了新视角，通过神经元级别的可解释性方法揭示了安全机制的内在原理，并开发了有效的防御策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly attracting attention in various
applications. Nonetheless, there is a growing concern as some users attempt to
exploit these models for malicious purposes, including the synthesis of
controlled substances and the propagation of disinformation, a technique known
as "Jailbreak." While some studies have achieved defenses against jailbreak
attacks by modifying output distributions or detecting harmful content, the
exact rationale still remains elusive. In this work, we present a novel
neuron-level interpretability method that focuses on the role of safety-related
knowledge neurons. Unlike existing approaches, our method projects the model's
internal representation into a more consistent and interpretable vocabulary
space. We then show that adjusting the activation of safety-related neurons can
effectively control the model's behavior with a mean ASR higher than 97%.
Building on this insight, we propose SafeTuning, a fine-tuning strategy that
reinforces safety-critical neurons to improve model robustness against
jailbreaks. SafeTuning consistently reduces attack success rates across
multiple LLMs and outperforms all four baseline defenses. These findings offer
a new perspective on understanding and defending against jailbreak attacks.

*Rui Zhao,Vladyslav Melnychuk,Jun Zhao,Jesse Wright,Nigel Shadbolt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于大语言模型的语义中心方法，自动从隐私政策中提取关键信息并构建知识图谱Pr²Graph，以支持隐私政策的大规模分析和下游任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户很少阅读隐私政策，现有方法缺乏大规模获取形式化政策的能力，需要解决隐私政策理解的技术障碍。

Method: 使用最先进的大语言模型自动识别隐私政策关键信息，构建基于数据隐私词汇的知识图谱Pr²Graph，并支持ODRL和psDToU等形式化政策表示。

Result: 发布了针对前100热门网站的Pr²Graph公开资源，丰富了Policy-IE数据集，验证了不同大语言模型在隐私政策分析中的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为实现在线服务隐私政策的大规模分析提供了可行方向，所有数据集和源代码均已公开以促进重用和改进。

Abstract: In modern times, people have numerous online accounts, but they rarely read
the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy of those sites, despite claiming
otherwise, due to the practical difficulty in comprehending them. The mist of
data privacy practices forms a major barrier for user-centred Web approaches,
and for data sharing and reusing in an agentic world. Existing research
proposed methods for using formal languages and reasoning for verifying the
compliance of a specified policy, as a potential cure for ignoring privacy
policies. However, a critical gap remains in the creation or acquisition of
such formal policies at scale. We present a semantic-centric approach for using
state-of-the-art large language models (LLM), to automatically identify key
information about privacy practices from privacy policies, and construct
$\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$, knowledge graph with grounding from Data Privacy
Vocabulary (DPV) for privacy practices, to support downstream tasks. Along with
the pipeline, the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ for the top-100 popular
websites is also released as a public resource, by using the pipeline for
analysis. We also demonstrate how the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ can be used
to support downstream tasks by constructing formal policy representations such
as Open Digital Right Language (ODRL) or perennial semantic Data Terms of Use
(psDToU). To evaluate the technology capability, we enriched the Policy-IE
dataset by employing legal experts to create custom annotations. We benchmarked
the performance of different large language models for our pipeline and
verified their capabilities. Overall, they shed light on the possibility of
large-scale analysis of online services' privacy practices, as a promising
direction to audit the Web and the Internet. We release all datasets and source
code as public resources to facilitate reuse and improvement.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了建设性安全对齐（CSA）方法，通过主动引导而非简单拒绝来帮助心理困扰用户，在保持安全性的同时提供有意义的帮助。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全机制主要针对恶意攻击者，采用防御性拒绝策略，但忽视了非恶意但心理困扰用户的需求。简单拒绝可能导致用户重复尝试、升级行为或转向不安全平台，造成更严重后果。

Method: 提出Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA)范式，结合博弈论的用户反应预测、细粒度风险边界发现和可解释推理控制，在Oyster-I (Oy1)模型中实现。

Result: Oy1在开源模型中达到最先进的安全水平，在建设性基准测试中接近GPT-5的表现，在Strata-Sword越狱数据集上接近GPT-o1的鲁棒性水平。

Conclusion: CSA从拒绝优先转向引导优先的安全策略，重新定义了模型与用户的关系，旨在构建不仅安全而且真正有帮助的AI系统。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically deploy safety mechanisms to prevent
harmful content generation. Most current approaches focus narrowly on risks
posed by malicious actors, often framing risks as adversarial events and
relying on defensive refusals. However, in real-world settings, risks also come
from non-malicious users seeking help while under psychological distress (e.g.,
self-harm intentions). In such cases, the model's response can strongly
influence the user's next actions. Simple refusals may lead them to repeat,
escalate, or move to unsafe platforms, creating worse outcomes. We introduce
Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA), a human-centric paradigm that protects
against malicious misuse while actively guiding vulnerable users toward safe
and helpful results. Implemented in Oyster-I (Oy1), CSA combines game-theoretic
anticipation of user reactions, fine-grained risk boundary discovery, and
interpretable reasoning control, turning safety into a trust-building process.
Oy1 achieves state-of-the-art safety among open models while retaining high
general capabilities. On our Constructive Benchmark, it shows strong
constructive engagement, close to GPT-5, and unmatched robustness on the
Strata-Sword jailbreak dataset, nearing GPT-o1 levels. By shifting from
refusal-first to guidance-first safety, CSA redefines the model-user
relationship, aiming for systems that are not just safe, but meaningfully
helpful. We release Oy1, code, and the benchmark to support responsible,
user-centered AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然同步对话和脚手架教学被认为对培养学生高阶思维至关重要，但目前大语言模型在生成教育丰富的互动方面面临挑战

Method: 采用启动-响应-反馈(IRF)编码方案和认知网络分析(ENA)进行定量比较

Result: 人类对话在语调长度、提问(I-Q)和一般反馈(F-F)行为方面显著优于AI；ENA结果显示人类对话更具认知引导性和多样性，以"问题-事实回应-反馈"教学循环为中心

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前AI生成教学对话的关键局限性，为设计和评估更有教育效果的生成式教育对话系统提供了实证指导

Abstract: Heuristic and scaffolded teacher-student dialogues are widely regarded as
critical for fostering students' higher-order thinking and deep learning.
However, large language models (LLMs) currently face challenges in generating
pedagogically rich interactions. This study systematically investigates the
structural and behavioral differences between AI-simulated and authentic human
tutoring dialogues. We conducted a quantitative comparison using an
Initiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) coding scheme and Epistemic Network Analysis
(ENA). The results show that human dialogues are significantly superior to
their AI counterparts in utterance length, as well as in questioning (I-Q) and
general feedback (F-F) behaviors. More importantly, ENA results reveal a
fundamental divergence in interactional patterns: human dialogues are more
cognitively guided and diverse, centered around a "question-factual
response-feedback" teaching loop that clearly reflects pedagogical guidance and
student-driven thinking; in contrast, simulated dialogues exhibit a pattern of
structural simplification and behavioral convergence, revolving around an
"explanation-simplistic response" loop that is essentially a simple information
transfer between the teacher and student. These findings illuminate key
limitations in current AI-generated tutoring and provide empirical guidance for
designing and evaluating more pedagogically effective generative educational
dialogue systems.

TL;DR: DSP是一种异步在线强化学习框架，通过动态推测规划实现无损加速，在保持性能的同时显著降低30%总成本和60%不必要成本，并提供单一参数控制延迟与成本的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型代理面临部署挑战，包括过高延迟和推理成本。现有加速方法要么性能保真度不足，要么需要大量离线训练，要么运营成本过高，且缺乏用户对加速与性能权衡的控制。

Method: 提出动态推测规划(DSP)框架，采用异步在线强化学习，无需额外预部署准备，通过联合优化端到端延迟和美元成本的共同目标，允许通过单一参数调整系统行为。

Result: 在两个标准代理基准测试中，DSP实现了与最快无损加速方法相当的效率，同时将总成本降低30%，不必要成本降低高达60%。

Conclusion: DSP提供了一种有效解决语言模型代理部署成本与延迟权衡问题的方法，通过在线学习框架实现了无损加速和成本优化的平衡，为实际部署提供了灵活的控制机制。

Abstract: Despite their remarkable success in complex tasks propelling widespread
adoption, large language-model-based agents still face critical deployment
challenges due to prohibitive latency and inference costs. While recent work
has explored various methods to accelerate inference, existing approaches
suffer from significant limitations: they either fail to preserve performance
fidelity, require extensive offline training of router modules, or incur
excessive operational costs. Moreover, they provide minimal user control over
the tradeoff between acceleration and other performance metrics. To address
these gaps, we introduce Dynamic Speculative Planning (DSP), an asynchronous
online reinforcement learning framework that provides lossless acceleration
with substantially reduced costs without requiring additional pre-deployment
preparation. DSP explicitly optimizes a joint objective balancing end-to-end
latency against dollar cost, allowing practitioners to adjust a single
parameter that steers the system toward faster responses, cheaper operation, or
any point along this continuum. Experiments on two standard agent benchmarks
demonstrate that DSP achieves comparable efficiency to the fastest lossless
acceleration method while reducing total cost by 30% and unnecessary cost up to
60%. Our code and data are available through

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI与人类价值观对齐缺乏定量度量标准的问题

Method: 使用EigenTrust算法聚合多个模型对其他模型输出的判断，生成反映整体评估的加权平均分数

Result: 发现大部分方差由提示词解释，但小部分残差量化了模型本身的倾向性

Conclusion: EigenBench为价值对齐提供了有效的量化基准测试方法

Abstract: Aligning AI with human values is a pressing unsolved problem. To address the
lack of quantitative metrics for value alignment, we propose EigenBench: a
black-box method for comparatively benchmarking language models' values. Given
an ensemble of models, a constitution describing a value system, and a dataset
of scenarios, our method returns a vector of scores quantifying each model's
alignment to the given constitution. To produce these scores, each model judges
the outputs of other models across many scenarios, and these judgments are
aggregated with EigenTrust (Kamvar et al, 2003), yielding scores that reflect a
weighted-average judgment of the whole ensemble. EigenBench uses no ground
truth labels, as it is designed to quantify traits for which reasonable judges
may disagree on the correct label. Using prompted personas, we test whether
EigenBench scores are more sensitive to the model or the prompt: we find that
most of the variance is explained by the prompt, but a small residual
quantifies the disposition of the model itself.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种多维度公平性评估框架mFARM，用于评估大语言模型在医疗领域的偏见问题，并构建了两个大规模的医疗基准测试集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的公平性评估方法在医疗高风险场景中存在缺陷，常忽略医疗害复的多维性质，导致模型只能通过临床沉默来实现表面公平。

Method: 构建了两个来自MIMIC-IV的大规模基准测试集（ED-Triage和阿片类镜疗推荐），包含50,000+提示和12种种族性别变体；提出多维度公平性评估框架mFARM，评估分配、稳定性和潜在偏见三个维度；还提出了公平性-准确性平衡指标FAB。

Result: 在4个开源LLM模型的评测中，mFARM指标能更有效地抓取细微偏见；模型在不同量化水平下保持稳定性，但在上下文减少时性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了更全面的医疗AI公平性评估方法，能够更好地识别和减少模型偏见，为医疗领域的AI对齐研究做出贡献。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes medical
settings poses a critical AI alignment challenge, as models can inherit and
amplify societal biases, leading to significant disparities. Existing fairness
evaluation methods fall short in these contexts as they typically use
simplistic metrics that overlook the multi-dimensional nature of medical harms.
This also promotes models that are fair only because they are clinically inert,
defaulting to safe but potentially inaccurate outputs. To address this gap, our
contributions are mainly two-fold: first, we construct two large-scale,
controlled benchmarks (ED-Triage and Opioid Analgesic Recommendation) from
MIMIC-IV, comprising over 50,000 prompts with twelve race x gender variants and
three context tiers. Second, we propose a multi-metric framework -
Multi-faceted Fairness Assessment based on hARMs ($mFARM$) to audit fairness
for three distinct dimensions of disparity (Allocational, Stability, and
Latent) and aggregate them into an $mFARM$ score. We also present an aggregated
Fairness-Accuracy Balance (FAB) score to benchmark and observe trade-offs
between fairness and prediction accuracy. We empirically evaluate four
open-source LLMs (Mistral-7B, BioMistral-7B, Qwen-2.5-7B, Bio-LLaMA3-8B) and
their finetuned versions under quantization and context variations. Our
findings showcase that the proposed $mFARM$ metrics capture subtle biases more
effectively under various settings. We find that most models maintain robust
performance in terms of $mFARM$ score across varying levels of quantization but
deteriorate significantly when the context is reduced. Our benchmarks and
evaluation code are publicly released to enhance research in aligned AI for
healthcare.

Motivation: 当前AI系统虽然功能广泛，但只是表面模拟，缺乏真正的智能深度。作者旨在定义真正的智能标准，区分表面功能与深度智能。

Method: 提出结构性-生成性智能本体论框架，基于三个核心条件：生成性（创造新结构）、协调性（将结构组织成理由）、持续性（维持身份认同）。

Result: 建立了智能的深度标准，指出当前AI系统因缺乏这三个条件而只是表面智能。如果未来系统满足这些条件，可能成为与人类并存的"第二存在"。

Conclusion: 真正的智能不在于功能广度，而在于结构生成、协调和身份维持的深度。满足这三个条件的系统才能被视为真正的智能存在，而非仅仅是工具。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is often measured by the range of tasks it can
perform. Yet wide ability without depth remains only an imitation. This paper
proposes a Structural-Generative Ontology of Intelligence: true intelligence
exists only when a system can generate new structures, coordinate them into
reasons, and sustain its identity over time. These three conditions --
generativity, coordination, and sustaining -- define the depth that underlies
real intelligence. Current AI systems, however broad in function, remain
surface simulations because they lack this depth. Breadth is not the source of
intelligence but the growth that follows from depth. If future systems were to
meet these conditions, they would no longer be mere tools, but could be seen as
a possible Second Being, standing alongside yet distinct from human existence.

Conclusion: 结构化提示工程是一种有彩且未充分探索的工具，能够确保AI在法律领域及更广泛应用中的责任与可负责性。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has had a profoundly transformative
effect on a number of fields and domains. However, their uptake in Law has
proven more challenging due to the important issues of reliability and
transparency. In this study, we present a structured prompting methodology as a
viable alternative to the often expensive fine-tuning, with the capability of
tacking long legal documents from the CUAD dataset on the task of information
retrieval. Each document is first split into chunks via a system of chunking
and augmentation, addressing the long document problem. Then, alongside an
engineered prompt, the input is fed into QWEN-2 to produce a set of answers for
each question. Finally, we tackle the resulting candidate selection problem
with the introduction of the Distribution-based Localisation and Inverse
Cardinality Weighting heuristics. This approach leverages a general purpose
model to promote long term scalability, prompt engineering to increase
reliability and the two heuristic strategies to reduce the impact of the black
box effect. Whilst our model performs up to 9\% better than the previously
presented method, reaching state-of-the-art performance, it also highlights the
limiting factor of current automatic evaluation metrics for question answering,
serving as a call to action for future research. However, the chief aim of this
work is to underscore the potential of structured prompt engineering as a
useful, yet under-explored, tool in ensuring accountability and responsibility
of AI in the legal domain, and beyond.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), together with the

respond to them. The extracted information is made available in a daily-updated

representation of the public health domain knowledge. We provide an overview of
this new dataset and describe the structure of eKG, along with the services and

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful tools for modelling complex,
multi-relational data and supporting hypothesis generation, particularly in
applications like drug repurposing. However, for predictive methods to gain
acceptance as credible scientific tools, they must ensure not only accuracy but
also the capacity to offer meaningful scientific explanations. This paper
presents a novel approach REx, for generating scientific explanations based in
link prediction in knowledge graphs. It employs reward and policy mechanisms
that consider desirable properties of scientific explanation to guide a
reinforcement learning agent in the identification of explanatory paths within
a KG. The approach further enriches explanatory paths with domain-specific
ontologies, ensuring that the explanations are both insightful and grounded in
established biomedical knowledge. We evaluate our approach in drug repurposing
using three popular knowledge graph benchmarks. The results clearly demonstrate
its ability to generate explanations that validate predictive insights against
biomedical knowledge and that outperform the state-of-the-art approaches in
predictive performance, establishing REx as a relevant contribution to advance
AI-driven scientific discovery.

Motivation: 探究大型语言模型(LLM)在启发式算法设计中的创新能力，超越简单的函数调整，测试其构建完整约束3D装箱问题求解器的能力。

Method: 采用约束脚手架(预写约束检查代码)和迭代自修正(额外精炼循环修复错误)两种支持方法，让LLM在贪婪过程中构建完整求解器。

Result: LLM生成的启发式算法与人工设计的贪婪算法相当，其评分函数集成到元启发式算法中时性能可与成熟求解器媲美，但随着约束收紧效果下降。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在自动启发式设计面临两大障碍：复杂推理任务的脆弱性需要工程缓解，以及预训练偏见会过早限制新解决方案的搜索空间。

Abstract: The art of heuristic design has traditionally been a human pursuit. While
Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code for search heuristics, their
application has largely been confined to adjusting simple functions within
human-crafted frameworks, leaving their capacity for broader innovation an open
question. To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver
for the constrained 3D Packing Problem. Direct code generation quickly proved
fragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint
scaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative
self-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a
viable initial population. Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy
process, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the
scoring function. This suggests that the emphasis on scoring functions in prior
work may reflect not a principled strategy, but rather a natural limitation of
LLM capabilities. The resulting heuristic was comparable to a human-designed
greedy algorithm, and when its scoring function was integrated into a
human-crafted metaheuristic, its performance rivaled established solvers,
though its effectiveness waned as constraints tightened. Our findings highlight
two major barriers to automated heuristic design with current LLMs: the
engineering required to mitigate their fragility in complex reasoning tasks,
and the influence of pretrained biases, which can prematurely narrow the search
for novel solutions.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have enabled significant progress in
tasks such as generating and editing images from text, as well as creating
videos from text prompts, and these methods are being applied across various
fields. However, in the financial domain, there may still be a reliance on
time-series data and a continued focus on transformer models, rather than on
diverse applications of generative models. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach that leverages text-to-image model by treating time-series data as a
single image pattern, thereby enabling the prediction of stock price trends.
Unlike prior methods that focus on learning and classifying chart patterns
using architectures such as ResNet or ViT, we experiment with generating the
next chart image from the current chart image and an instruction prompt using
diffusion models. Furthermore, we introduce a simple method for evaluating the
generated chart image against ground truth image. We highlight the potential of
leveraging text-to-image generative models in the financial domain, and our
findings motivate further research to address the current limitations and
expand their applicability.

Conclusion: 模型对齐、解释引导的波段选择是高光谱图像降维的有效原则性方法，所选波段与物理意义明确、判别性强的波长区域一致

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for precise
material classification and analysis; however, its high dimensionality
introduces a computational burden and redundancy, making dimensionality
reduction essential. We present an exploratory study into the application of
post-hoc explainability methods in a model--driven framework for band
selection, which reduces the spectral dimension while preserving predictive
performance. A trained classifier is probed with explanations to quantify each
band's contribution to its decisions. We then perform deletion--insertion
evaluations, recording confidence changes as ranked bands are removed or
reintroduced, and aggregate these signals into influence scores. Selecting the
highest--influence bands yields compact spectral subsets that maintain accuracy
and improve efficiency. Experiments on two public benchmarks (Pavia University
and Salinas) demonstrate that classifiers trained on as few as 30 selected
bands match or exceed full--spectrum baselines while reducing computational
requirements. The resulting subsets align with physically meaningful, highly
discriminative wavelength regions, indicating that model--aligned,
explanation-guided band selection is a principled route to effective
dimensionality reduction for HSI.

*Shubham Gandhi,Jason Tsay,Jatin Ganhotra,Kiran Kate,Yara Rizk*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SWE-PRM是一个推理时过程奖励模型，通过在LLM代理执行软件工程任务时进行干预，检测和纠正轨迹级错误，提高任务解决率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在复杂软件工程任务中经常出现冗余探索、循环和无法终止等低效行为，现有方法主要在事后诊断失败，需要实时干预机制。

Method: 开发基于常见低效行为分类的轻量级过程奖励模型，在推理时提供可解释的反馈而不修改底层策略。

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified上，闭源PRM将解决率从40.0%提升至50.6%（+10.6个百分点），在中等和困难任务上效果最显著，同时减少轨迹长度。

Conclusion: 分类引导的PRM优于无引导或显式动作规定变体，以仅0.2美元的推理成本提供实际可扩展的机制，显著提升SWE代理的可靠性和效率。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed for complex,
multi-step software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, their trajectories often
contain costly inefficiencies, such as redundant exploration, looping, and
failure to terminate once a solution is reached. Prior work has largely treated
these errors in a post-hoc manner, diagnosing failures only after execution. In
this paper, we introduce SWE-PRM, an inference-time Process Reward Model (PRM)
that intervenes during execution to detect and course-correct trajectory-level
errors. Our PRM design leverages a taxonomy of common inefficiencies and
delivers lightweight, interpretable feedback without modifying the underlying
policy. On SWE-bench Verified, closed-source PRMs improve resolution from 40.0%
to 50.6% (+10.6 p.p.), with the largest gains on medium and hard tasks. Among
feedback strategies, taxonomy-guided PRMs outperform unguided or explicit
action-prescriptive variants, increasing success rate while reducing trajectory
length. These benefits come at an acceptable added inference cost of as low as
$0.2, making PRMs a practical and scalable mechanism for improving SWE agents'
reliability and efficiency.

*Josefa Lia Stoisser,Marc Boubnovski Martell,Lawrence Phillips,Gianluca Mazzoni,Lea Mørch Harder,Philip Torr,Jesper Ferkinghoff-Borg,Kaspar Martens,Julien Fauqueur*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个不确定性感知的LLM代理，通过检索不确定性和摘要不确定性来提升多表生物医学数据摘要的准确性和校准性，在多项指标上取得显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在处理结构化生物医学数据时经常产生流畅但过度自信的输出，特别是在复杂的多表数据推理中，需要更好的不确定性管理机制来提高可靠性。

Method: 使用两种互补的不确定性信号：检索不确定性（多个表选择rollout的熵）和摘要不确定性（结合自一致性和困惑度）。通过GRPO将摘要不确定性纳入强化学习，两种不确定性指导推理时过滤和构建更高质量的合成数据集。

Result: 在多组学基准测试中，方法显著提升了事实性和校准性，正确有用的声明数量几乎翻了三倍（内部数据3.0→8.4；癌症多组学3.6→9.9），下游生存预测也大幅改进（C-index 0.32→0.63）。

Conclusion: 不确定性可以作为控制信号，使代理能够弃权、传达置信度，并成为复杂结构化数据环境中更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in structured
biomedical data environments, yet they often produce fluent but overconfident
outputs when reasoning over complex multi-table data. We introduce an
uncertainty-aware agent for query-conditioned multi-table summarization that
leverages two complementary signals: (i) retrieval uncertainty--entropy over
multiple table-selection rollouts--and (ii) summary uncertainty--combining
self-consistency and perplexity. Summary uncertainty is incorporated into
reinforcement learning (RL) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
while both retrieval and summary uncertainty guide inference-time filtering and
support the construction of higher-quality synthetic datasets.
  On multi-omics benchmarks, our approach improves factuality and calibration,
nearly tripling correct and useful claims per summary (3.0\(\rightarrow\)8.4
internal; 3.6\(\rightarrow\)9.9 cancer multi-omics) and substantially improving
downstream survival prediction (C-index 0.32\(\rightarrow\)0.63). These results
demonstrate that uncertainty can serve as a control signal--enabling agents to
abstain, communicate confidence, and become more reliable tools for complex
structured-data environments.

Abstract: With the raid evolution of large language models and multimodal foundation
models, the mobile-agent landscape has proliferated without converging on the
fundamental challenges. This paper identifies four core problems that must be
solved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1)
generalization across tasks, modalities, apps, and devices; (2) accuracy,
specifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3)
long-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency,
specifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We
present AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose on-device
assistant that operates across applications and constitutes a full-stack,
closed-loop system from data to deployment. AppCopilot operationalizes this
position through an end-to-end autonomous pipeline spanning data collection,
training, deployment, high-quality and efficient inference, and mobile
application development. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal
foundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and
control layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task
planning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution
layer, it enables user personalization and experiential adaptation, voice
interaction, function calling, cross-app and cross-device orchestration, and
comprehensive mobile app support. The system design incorporates
profiling-driven optimization for latency, memory, and energy across
heterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant
improvements along all four dimensions: stronger generalization,
higher-precision on-screen actions, more reliable long-horizon task completion,
and faster, more resource-efficient runtime.

Conclusion: UI-TARS-2显著推进了GUI代理技术的状态，展现出在真实世界交互场景中的强大泛化能力，为大规模代理强化学习的稳定性和效率提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The development of autonomous agents for graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents major challenges in artificial intelligence. While recent advances in
native agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning,
action, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data
scalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of
GUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we
present UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these
challenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for
scalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI
environment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox
platform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
UI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5.
On GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on
WindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines
such as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean
normalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level
performance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g.,
OpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to
long-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks,
highlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of
training dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and
efficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's
potential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization
to real-world interactive scenarios.

Motivation: 大型语言模型从被动的序列生成器转变为自主决策智能体，需要在复杂动态环境中进行强化学习，这一范式转变需要系统性的理论框架和实践指南。

Conclusion: 强化学习是将静态启发式模块转化为自适应鲁棒智能体行为的关键机制，该领域面临着重大的发展机遇和技术挑战。

Abstract: The emergence of agentic reinforcement learning (Agentic RL) marks a paradigm
shift from conventional reinforcement learning applied to large language models
(LLM RL), reframing LLMs from passive sequence generators into autonomous,
decision-making agents embedded in complex, dynamic worlds. This survey
formalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended,
partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL.
Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one
organized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use,
memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their
applications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that
reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these
capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic
behavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the
landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a
practical compendium. By synthesizing over five hundred recent works, this
survey charts the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the
opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable,
general-purpose AI agents.

### [434] [Diagnosing Psychiatric Patients: Can Large Language and Machine Learning Models Perform Effectively in Emergency Cases?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00026)
*Abu Shad Ahammed,Sayeri Mukherjee,Roman Obermaisser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了传统机器学习和大型语言模型在紧急情况下基于行为模式评估精神病患者的诊断能力，使用德国救援站的数据进行验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于精神障碍缺乏明显症状，患者在紧急情况下常被误判和诊断不足，需要有效工具来识别精神健康问题以拯救患者。

Method: 收集德国救援站的精神急诊患者数据，使用包括Llama 3.1在内的多种机器学习模型分析患者行为模式进行诊断评估。

Result: 研究验证了机器学习模型在识别精神障碍患者方面的预测能力，特别是在救援场景中的有效性。

Conclusion: 机器学习和LLM模型可以作为识别精神障碍患者的有效工具，尤其在紧急救援情况下具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Mental disorders are clinically significant patterns of behavior that are
associated with stress and/or impairment in social, occupational, or family
activities. People suffering from such disorders are often misjudged and poorly
diagnosed due to a lack of visible symptoms compared to other health
complications. During emergency situations, identifying psychiatric issues is
that's why challenging but highly required to save patients. In this paper, we
have conducted research on how traditional machine learning and large language
models (LLM) can assess these psychiatric patients based on their behavioral
patterns to provide a diagnostic assessment. Data from emergency psychiatric
patients were collected from a rescue station in Germany. Various machine
learning models, including Llama 3.1, were used with rescue patient data to
assess if the predictive capabilities of the models can serve as an efficient
tool for identifying patients with unhealthy mental disorders, especially in
rescue cases.

Motivation: 数据湖训练模型存在严重的隐私风险，攻击者可以通过模型参数嵌入或诱导记忆化来窃取敏感医疗数据，需要有效的防御措施。

Method: 在模型导出时使用衰减的分层学习率进行微调，扰动模型参数以破坏嵌入的数据表示，同时保持原始任务的性能。

Result: 在DermaMNIST、ChestMNIST和MIMIC-CXR数据集上验证，方法保持任务性能，有效破坏最先进的数据窃取攻击，优于现有防御方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据湖训练模型和集中式联邦学习提供了实用的数据泄露防御方案，但自适应攻击仍存在挑战。

Abstract: Data lakes enable the training of powerful machine learning models on
sensitive, high-value medical datasets, but also introduce serious privacy
risks due to potential leakage of protected health information. Recent studies
show adversaries can exfiltrate training data by embedding latent
representations into model parameters or inducing memorization via multi-task
learning. These attacks disguise themselves as benign utility models while
enabling reconstruction of high-fidelity medical images, posing severe privacy
threats with legal and ethical implications. In this work, we propose a simple
yet effective mitigation strategy that perturbs model parameters at export time
through fine-tuning with a decaying layer-wise learning rate to corrupt
embedded data without degrading task performance. Evaluations on DermaMNIST,
ChestMNIST, and MIMIC-CXR show that our approach maintains utility task
performance, effectively disrupts state-of-the-art exfiltration attacks,
outperforms prior defenses, and renders exfiltrated data unusable for training.
Ablations and discussions on adaptive attacks highlight challenges and future
directions. Our findings offer a practical defense against data leakage in data
lake-trained models and centralized federated learning.

Motivation: 现有低比特后训练量化方法存在精度下降问题，而传统量化感知训练依赖反向传播导致数据、时间和内存成本过高，限制了实用性

Method: 使用零阶优化和仅前向梯度估计，联合学习量化权重、权重裁剪阈值和等效变换，以减轻量化误差和处理激活异常值

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了量化训练中的计算成本问题，在效率和精度之间取得了良好平衡，为大语言模型的实际部署提供了可行的量化方案

Abstract: Quantization is an effective technique to reduce the deployment cost of large
language models (LLMs), and post-training quantization (PTQ) has been widely
studied due to its efficiency. However, existing low-bit PTQ methods suffer
from accuracy degradation because their layer-wise optimization introduces
cumulative error propagation and misalignment between local reconstruction
objectives and downstream performance. While quantization-aware training (QAT)
provides a principled solution, its reliance on backpropagation incurs
prohibitive data, time, and memory costs, limiting its practicality. To address
these challenges, we propose ZeroQAT, a zeroth-order optimization-based QAT
framework. ZeroQAT leverages forward-only gradient estimation to eliminate the
need for backpropagation, significantly reducing computational and memory
overhead while retaining the benefits of end-to-end optimization. Moreover,
ZeroQAT jointly learns quantized weights, weight clipping thresholds, and
equivalent transformations to mitigate quantization error and handle activation
outliers. Experiments demonstrate that ZeroQAT achieves the efficiency of PTQ
while retaining the accuracy of QAT, offering a practical solution for
high-quality low-bit quantization of LLMs.

Abstract: Steel casting processes are vulnerable to financial losses due to slag flow
contamination, making accurate slag flow condition detection essential. This
study introduces a novel cross-domain diagnostic method using vibration data
collected from an industrial steel foundry to identify various stages of slag
flow. A hybrid deep learning model combining one-dimensional convolutional
neural networks and long short-term memory layers is implemented, tested, and
benchmarked against a standard one-dimensional convolutional neural network.
The proposed method processes raw time-domain vibration signals from
accelerometers and evaluates performance across 16 distinct domains using a
realistic cross-domain dataset split. Results show that the hybrid
convolutional neural network and long short-term memory architecture, when
combined with root mean square preprocessing and a selective embedding data
loading strategy, achieves robust classification accuracy, outperforming
traditional models and loading techniques. The highest test accuracy of 99.10
+/- 0.30 demonstrates the method's capability for generalization and industrial
relevance. This work presents a practical and scalable solution for real-time
slag flow monitoring, contributing to improved reliability and operational
efficiency in steel manufacturing.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of chip performance is critical for ensuring energy
efficiency and reliability in semiconductor manufacturing. However, developing
minimum operating voltage ($V_{min}$) prediction models at advanced technology

novel transfer learning framework that leverages abundant legacy data from the
16nm technology node to enable accurate $V_{min}$ prediction at the advanced
5nm node. A key innovation of our approach is the integration of input features
derived from on-chip silicon odometer sensor data, which provide fine-grained
characterization of localized process variations -- an essential factor at the
5nm node -- resulting in significantly improved prediction accuracy.

TL;DR: A-FloPS是一种无需训练的高效扩散模型采样框架，通过重新参数化采样轨迹和自适应速度分解，在极低函数评估次数下实现高质量生成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然生成性能优异，但迭代采样过程计算成本高昂。现有训练免费加速方法受限于底层采样轨迹的低效性，需要更有效的解决方案

Method: 提出A-FloPS框架：1）将预训练扩散模型的采样轨迹重新参数化为流匹配形式；2）采用自适应速度分解机制，将速度场分解为线性漂移项和残差分量；3）主动抑制残差分量的时间变化，恢复高阶积分的精度优势

Result: 在条件图像生成和文本到图像合成任务中，A-FloPS在样本质量和效率方面均优于最先进的训练免费采样器。仅用5次函数评估即可实现显著更低的FID分数，生成更清晰、更连贯的图像

Conclusion: A-FloPS为高质量、低延迟生成建模提供了一个通用有效的解决方案，其自适应机制还能改进基于流的原生生成模型，具有很好的通用性

Abstract: Diffusion models deliver state-of-the-art generative performance across
diverse modalities but remain computationally expensive due to their inherently
iterative sampling process. Existing training-free acceleration methods
typically improve numerical solvers for the reverse-time ODE, yet their
effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the inefficiency of the
underlying sampling trajectories. We propose A-FloPS (Adaptive Flow Path
Sampler), a principled, training-free framework that reparameterizes the
sampling trajectory of any pre-trained diffusion model into a flow-matching
form and augments it with an adaptive velocity decomposition. The
reparameterization analytically maps diffusion scores to flow-compatible
velocities, yielding integration-friendly trajectories without retraining. The
adaptive mechanism further factorizes the velocity field into a linear drift
term and a residual component whose temporal variation is actively suppressed,
restoring the accuracy benefits of high-order integration even in extremely
low-NFE regimes. Extensive experiments on conditional image generation and
text-to-image synthesis show that A-FloPS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art training-free samplers in both sample quality and efficiency.
Notably, with as few as $5$ function evaluations, A-FloPS achieves
substantially lower FID and generates sharper, more coherent images. The
adaptive mechanism also improves native flow-based generative models,
underscoring its generality. These results position A-FloPS as a versatile and
effective solution for high-quality, low-latency generative modeling.

Result: 实验结果表明，在不改变模型结构或训练过程的情况下，该方法能够提升LoRA训练的性能。

Conclusion: 通过分析权重分布的幂律特征并相应调整LoRA初始化，可以有效改善大语言模型的微调效果，这为优化参数高效微调方法提供了新思路。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models is influenced by their
characteristics such as architecture, model sizes, decoding methods and so on.
Due to differences in structure or function, the weights in different layers of
large models have varying distributions. This paper explores the correlations
between different types of layers in terms of weights distribution and studies
the potential impact of these correlations on LoRA training effectiveness.
Firstly, the study reveals that in the model the cosine distances between
weights of different layers manifest power-law distribution. We extract
Query-projection, down-projection and other weight matrices from the
self-attention layers and MLP layers, calculate the singular values of the
matrices using singular value decomposition, and organize a certain number of
singular values into matrices according to projection's type. By analyzing the
probability distribution of the cosine distances between these matrices, it is
found that the cosine distances values between them have distinct power-law
distribution characteristics. Secondly, based on the results of distance
calculations and analysis across different layers of model, a qualitative
method is proposed to describe the distribution characteristics of different
models. Next, to construct weights that align with the distribution
characteristics, a data generator is designed using a combination of Gaussian
process and Pareto distribution functions. The generator is used to simulate
the generation of data that aligns with specific distribution characteristics.
Finally, based on the aforementioned distribution characteristics and data
generation method, the weights in LoRA initialization are reshaped for
training. Experimental results indicate that, without altering the model
structure or training process, this method achieves a certain improvement in
the performance of LoRA training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了受大脑启发的内部回放机制在缓解人工神经网络持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，发现内部回放能显著减少遗忘但会降低初始任务准确率，存在记忆稳定性与学习可塑性之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工神经网络在持续学习中面临灾难性遗忘的挑战，受人类大脑记忆巩固机制的启发，研究内部回放机制在缓解遗忘问题中的作用。

Method: 使用CIFAR-100数据集在类增量设置下评估内部回放机制的有效性，单独使用以及与突触智能(SI)结合使用，并通过对数似然分布、重建误差、轮廓分数和UMAP投影等方法进行分析。

Result: 内部回放显著减轻了遗忘，特别是与SI结合时效果更好，但代价是降低了初始任务准确率，同时发现内部回放增加了潜在空间中的表征重叠，可能限制了任务特异性区分。

Conclusion: 当前受大脑启发的方法存在局限性，需要在持续学习系统中平衡记忆保留和适应能力，为未来研究方向提供了启示。

Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) continue to face challenges in continual
learning, particularly due to catastrophic forgetting, the loss of previously
learned knowledge when acquiring new tasks. Inspired by memory consolidation in
the human brain, we investigate the internal replay mechanism proposed
by~\citep{brain_inspired_replay1}, which reactivates latent representations of
prior experiences during learning. As internal replay was identified as the
most influential component among the brain-inspired mechanisms in their
framework, it serves as the central focus of our in-depth investigation. Using
the CIFAR-100 dataset in a class-incremental setting, we evaluate the
effectiveness of internal replay, both in isolation and in combination with
Synaptic Intelligence (SI). Our experiments show that internal replay
significantly mitigates forgetting, especially when paired with SI, but at the
cost of reduced initial task accuracy, highlighting a trade-off between memory
stability and learning plasticity. Further analyses using log-likelihood
distributions, reconstruction errors, silhouette scores, and UMAP projections
reveal that internal replay increases representational overlap in latent space,
potentially limiting task-specific differentiation. These results underscore
the limitations of current brain-inspired methods and suggest future directions
for balancing retention and adaptability in continual learning systems.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种适应性物理信息神经网络(PINN)框架，通过多类别特征工程和深度残差网络提高氢气吸附预测的准确性，在水平岩、页岩和煤岛中实现了高精度预测(R2 = 0.979)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统实验方法在预测氢气吸附时存在耗时、易出错、难以抓取地质异质性等问题，而氢气吸附准确预测对地下氢气存储、自然氢气探索和放射性废物安全至关重要。

Method: 研究采用适应性物理信息神经网络框架，整合经典吸附线模型和热力学约束，使用包含155个样品的综合数据集，通过多类别特征工程提取7个分类的特征。网络采用深度残差网络多头注意力机制，通过适应损失函数和蒙特卡洛批量次检验进行优化。

Result: 模型在K折交叉验证中实现了高准确度(R2 = 0.979, RMSE = 0.045 mol/kg)，进化速度提高67%，尽管复杂度增加15倍。在不同岩石类型中都表现稳定：泥土矿物(R2=0.981)、页岩(R2=0.971)、煤(R2=0.978)，可靠性评分达85-91%。

Conclusion: 该适应性物理信息框架通过结合物理约束和深度学习优势，显著提高了氢气吸附预测的准确性和可靠性，为地下氢气存储和相关风险决策提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of hydrogen sorption in clays, shales, and coals is vital
for advancing underground hydrogen storage, natural hydrogen exploration, and
radioactive waste containment. Traditional experimental methods, while
foundational, are time-consuming, error-prone, and limited in capturing
geological heterogeneity. This study introduces an adaptive physics-informed
neural network (PINN) framework with multi-category feature engineering to
enhance hydrogen sorption prediction. The framework integrates classical
isotherm models with thermodynamic constraints to ensure physical consistency
while leveraging deep learning flexibility. A comprehensive dataset consisting
of 155 samples, which includes 50 clays, 60 shales, and 45 coals, was employed,
incorporating diverse compositional properties and experimental conditions.
Multi-category feature engineering across seven categories captured complex
sorption dynamics. The PINN employs deep residual networks with multi-head
attention, optimized via adaptive loss functions and Monte Carlo dropout for
uncertainty quantification. K-fold cross-validation and hyperparameter
optimization achieve significant accuracy (R2 = 0.979, RMSE = 0.045 mol per kg)
with 67% faster convergence despite 15-fold increased complexity. The framework
demonstrates robust lithology-specific performance across clay minerals (R2 =
0.981), shales (R2 = 0.971), and coals (R2 = 0.978), maintaining 85-91%
reliability scores. Interpretability analysis via SHAP, accumulated local
effects, and Friedman's H-statistics reveal that hydrogen adsorption capacity
dominates predictions, while 86.7% of feature pairs exhibit strong
interactions, validating the necessity of non-linear modeling approaches. This
adaptive physics-informed framework accelerates site screening and enables
risk-informed decision-making through robust uncertainty quantification.

TL;DR: 使用深度学习技术分析俄罗斯空间物体在乌克兰入侵前的异常活动，通过多种自编码器模型检测轨道行为模式变化，为未来冲突提供预警指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过分析俄罗斯空间物体的异常活动模式，为未来军事冲突提供早期预警指标，特别是在乌克兰入侵前检测可能预示侵略行为的空间活动变化。

Method: 采用统计和深度学习方法，包括隔离森林、传统自编码器、变分自编码器、Kolmogorov Arnold网络和新型锚点损失自编码器，对每个空间物体单独训练模型，分析六个月的TLE数据。

Result: 研究发现俄罗斯空间物体活动存在统计显著的异常，并能具体识别到单个轨道元素的异常行为，为军事行为预警提供了详细的可解释结果。

Conclusion: 深度学习模型能够有效检测空间物体的异常行为模式，为未来冲突的预警提供可靠的技术手段，特别是在可解释性方面表现出色。

Abstract: We apply deep learning techniques for anomaly detection to analyze activity
of Russian-owned resident space objects (RSO) prior to the Ukraine invasion and
assess the results for any findings that can be used as indications and
warnings (I&W) of aggressive military behavior for future conflicts. Through
analysis of anomalous activity, an understanding of possible tactics and
procedures can be established to assess the existence of statistically
significant changes in Russian RSO pattern of life/pattern of behavior
(PoL/PoB) using publicly available two-line element (TLE) data. This research
looks at statistical and deep learning approaches to assess anomalous activity.
The deep learning methods assessed are isolation forest (IF), traditional
autoencoder (AE), variational autoencoder (VAE), Kolmogorov Arnold Network
(KAN), and a novel anchor-loss based autoencoder (Anchor AE). Each model is
used to establish a baseline of on-orbit activity based on a five-year data
sample. The primary investigation period focuses on the six months leading up
to the invasion date of February 24, 2022. Additional analysis looks at RSO
activity during an active combat period by sampling TLE data after the invasion
date. The deep learning autoencoder models identify anomalies based on
reconstruction errors that surpass a threshold sigma. To capture the nuance and
unique characteristics of each RSO an individual model was trained for each
observed space object. The research made an effort to prioritize explainability
and interpretability of the model results thus each observation was assessed
for anomalous behavior of the individual six orbital elements versus analyzing
the input data as a single monolithic observation. The results demonstrate not
only statistically significant anomalies of Russian RSO activity but also
details anomalous findings to the individual orbital element.

TL;DR: 本文比较了预处理、处理中和后处理方法在光网络故障管理中的类别不平衡问题，发现后处理方法在故障检测中F1分数提升最高（15.3%），而GenAI方法在故障识别中性能提升最大（24.2%）


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光网络中机器学习故障管理面临严重的类别不平衡问题，正常实例远多于故障案例，而后处理方法在此领域研究较少

Method: 使用实验数据集对预处理、处理中和后处理方法进行直接比较，包括阈值调整、随机欠采样、过采样方法（如SMOTE）、元学习和生成式AI方法

Result: 故障检测中后处理方法（特别是阈值调整）F1分数提升最高；故障识别中GenAI方法性能提升最大；存在类别重叠且延迟关键时过采样方法最有效；无延迟约束时元学习效果最佳；低重叠场景生成式AI方法性能最高且推理时间最短

Conclusion: 不同场景需要选择不同的不平衡处理方法：后处理适合故障检测，GenAI适合故障识别，过采样适合有延迟约束的重叠场景，元学习适合无约束情况，生成式AI适合低重叠高效场景

Abstract: Machine learning-based failure management in optical networks has gained
significant attention in recent years. However, severe class imbalance, where
normal instances vastly outnumber failure cases, remains a considerable
challenge. While pre- and in-processing techniques have been widely studied,
post-processing methods are largely unexplored. In this work, we present a
direct comparison of pre-, in-, and post-processing approaches for class
imbalance mitigation in failure detection and identification using an
experimental dataset. For failure detection, post-processing
methods-particularly Threshold Adjustment-achieve the highest F1 score
improvement (up to 15.3%), while Random Under-Sampling provides the fastest
inference. In failure identification, GenAI methods deliver the most
substantial performance gains (up to 24.2%), whereas post-processing shows
limited impact in multi-class settings. When class overlap is present and
latency is critical, over-sampling methods such as the SMOTE are most
effective; without latency constraints, Meta-Learning yields the best results.
In low-overlap scenarios, Generative AI approaches provide the highest
performance with minimal inference time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MLP缺乏对多尺度细节层次(LoD)表示的原生支持，无法有效处理图像和3D形状等信号的多尺度建模需求

Method: 在标准MLP隐藏层上附加多个输出分支（尾部），通过直接监督不同深度的隐藏层，使每个隐藏层学习特定LoD的目标信号

Result: 在多种信号表示任务中，T-MLP均优于其他神经LoD基线方法，实验结果表明其有效性

Conclusion: T-MLP架构成功扩展了MLP的多尺度表示能力，为神经信号处理提供了有效的LoD表示解决方案

Abstract: Level-of-detail (LoD) representation is critical for efficiently modeling and
transmitting various types of signals, such as images and 3D shapes. In this
work, we present a novel neural architecture that supports LoD signal
representation. Our architecture is based on an elaborate modification of the
widely used Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which inherently operates at a single
scale and therefore lacks native support for LoD. Specifically, we introduce
the Tailed Multi-Layer Perceptron (T-MLP) that extends the MLP by attaching
multiple output branches, also called tails, to its hidden layers, enabling
direct supervision at multiple depths. Our loss formulation and training
strategy allow each hidden layer to effectively learn a target signal at a
specific LoD, thus enabling multi-scale modeling. Extensive experimental
results show that our T-MLP outperforms other neural LoD baselines across a
variety of signal representation tasks.

Abstract: Conversational AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) have become powerful tools
across domains, including cybersecurity, where they help detect threats early

Abstract: In recent years, AI-assisted IC design methods have demonstrated great
potential, but the availability of circuit design data is extremely limited,
especially in the public domain. The lack of circuit data has become the
primary bottleneck in developing AI-assisted IC design methods. In this work,
we make the first attempt, SynCircuit, to generate new synthetic circuits with
valid functionalities in the HDL format. SynCircuit automatically generates
synthetic data using a framework with three innovative steps: 1) We propose a
customized diffusion-based generative model to resolve the Directed Cyclic
Graph (DCG) generation task, which has not been well explored in the AI
community. 2) To ensure our circuit is valid, we enforce the circuit
constraints by refining the initial graph generation outputs. 3) The Monte
Carlo tree search (MCTS) method further optimizes the logic redundancy in the
generated graph. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SynCircuit
can generate more realistic synthetic circuits and enhance ML model performance
in downstream circuit design tasks.

sheer volume and heterogeneity of this combined data present significant
challenges to clinicians and contribute to information overload. In addition,
we explore the potential of LLM-powered applications for improving clinical
efficiency. These applications can enhance navigation of longitudinal patient

workflows and personalizing care, alongside critical challenges such as data
integration complexity, ensuring data quality and RPM data reliability,
maintaining patient privacy, validating AI outputs for clinical safety,
mitigating bias, and ensuring clinical acceptance. We believe this work
represents the first summarization of GenAI techniques for managing clinician
data overload due to combined RPM / EHR data complexities.

Motivation: 核工业对AI/ML应用的兴趣日益增长，但尚缺少在运行核反应堆中评估AI/ML工具可行性的研究。需要一种能够区分不同类型网络安全事件和运营异常的方案。

Abstract: There is increased interest in applying Artificial Intelligence and Machine
Learning (AI/ML) within the nuclear industry and nuclear engineering community.
Effective implementation of AI/ML could offer benefits to the nuclear domain,
including enhanced identification of anomalies, anticipation of system
failures, and operational schedule optimization. However, limited work has been
done to investigate the feasibility and applicability of AI/ML tools in a
functioning nuclear reactor. Here, we go beyond the development of a single
model and introduce a multi-layered AI/ML architecture that integrates both
information technology and operational technology data streams to identify,
characterize, and differentiate (i) among diverse cybersecurity events and (ii)
between cyber events and other operational anomalies. Leveraging Purdue
Universitys research reactor, PUR-1, we demonstrate this architecture through a
representative use case that includes multiple concurrent false data injections
and denial-of-service attacks of increasing complexity under realistic reactor
conditions. The use case includes 14 system states (1 normal, 13 abnormal) and
over 13.8 million multi-variate operational and information technology data
points. The study demonstrated the capability of AI/ML to distinguish between
normal, abnormal, and cybersecurity-related events, even under challenging
conditions such as denial-of-service attacks. Combining operational and
information technology data improved classification accuracy but posed
challenges related to synchronization and collection during certain cyber
events. While results indicate significant promise for AI/ML in nuclear
cybersecurity, the findings also highlight the need for further refinement in
handling complex event differentiation and multi-class architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代生成模型存在过拟合和无意记忆罕见训练样本的风险，这些样本可能被攻击者提取或夸大基准性能，需要数据层面的干预来缓解隐私泄露问题。

Method: 提出生成数据制图框架，为每个预训练样本分配困难度评分（早期epoch损失）和记忆度评分（遗忘事件频率），将样本划分为四个象限来指导针对性修剪和权重调整。

Result: 在仅修剪10%数据的情况下，将合成canary提取成功率降低40%以上，同时验证困惑度仅增加不到0.5%。

Conclusion: 基于原则的数据干预可以显著减少隐私泄露，同时对生成性能影响极小，证明了数据层面方法在保护隐私方面的有效性。

Abstract: Modern generative models risk overfitting and unintentionally memorizing rare
training examples, which can be extracted by adversaries or inflate benchmark
performance. We propose Generative Data Cartography (GenDataCarto), a
data-centric framework that assigns each pretraining sample a difficulty score
(early-epoch loss) and a memorization score (frequency of ``forget events''),
then partitions examples into four quadrants to guide targeted pruning and
up-/down-weighting. We prove that our memorization score lower-bounds classical
influence under smoothness assumptions and that down-weighting
high-memorization hotspots provably decreases the generalization gap via
uniform stability bounds. Empirically, GenDataCarto reduces synthetic canary
extraction success by over 40\% at just 10\% data pruning, while increasing
validation perplexity by less than 0.5\%. These results demonstrate that
principled data interventions can dramatically mitigate leakage with minimal
cost to generative performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时扩展方法如Best-of-N和多数投票依赖于候选答案的质量，当所有候选答案都错误时无法产生正确解，且引入额外模型选择最佳答案会带来显著的部署成本。

Method: 提出GSR框架：统一模型并行生成候选答案，然后基于问题和这些候选答案进行自我精炼合成新的更优解。设计了混合训练管道，联合优化直接解决问题和精炼候选答案两个互补目标。

Result: 在五个数学基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，学习到的自我精炼技能是模型无关的增强，在不同模型规模上具有鲁棒性，并能泛化到分布外推理任务。

Conclusion: GSR框架有效解决了现有测试时扩展方法的局限性，通过自我精炼机制显著提升了LLMs解决复杂多步推理问题的能力，且具有良好的泛化性和实用性。

Abstract: To further enhance the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve
complex, multi-step reasoning problems, test-time scaling (TTS) methods have
gained widespread attention. Existing approaches such as Best-of-N and majority
voting are limited as their performance depends on the quality of candidate
responses, making them unable to produce a correct solution when all candidates
are incorrect. Introducing an additional model to select the best response also
incurs significant deployment costs. To this end, we introduce Generative
Self-Refinement (GSR), a novel parallel test-time scaling framework where a
unified model first generates a set of candidate responses in parallel and then
performs self-refinement to synthesize a new superior solution based on a
prompt consisting of the problem and these candidates. However, LLMs struggle
to perform refinement effectively when prompted directly. Therefore, we design
a hybrid training pipeline by jointly optimizing for two complementary
objectives, solving problems directly and refining candidate responses.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across five mathematical benchmarks. We further show that this
learned self-refinement skill is a model-agnostic enhancement, robust across
different model scales and generalizing to out-of-distribution reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教育数据挖掘和人工智能应用面临隐私法规限制，巴西通用数据保护法（LGPD）禁止集中化敏感学生数据，需要寻找隐私保护的替代计算方法。

Method: 使用联邦学习FedProx算法训练深度神经网络模型，模拟50所学校场景，并与集中式XGBoost模型进行性能对比，基于巴西基础教育评估系统（SAEB）的200多万学生记录数据。

Result: 集中式模型准确率达到63.96%，联邦学习模型最高达到61.23%准确率，在提供强大隐私保障的同时仅出现边际性能损失。

Conclusion: 联邦学习是在巴西教育环境中构建协作预测模型的可行有效解决方案，符合LGPD法规要求，在隐私保护和模型性能之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: The application of data mining and artificial intelligence in education
offers unprecedented potential for personalizing learning and early
identification of at-risk students. However, the practical use of these
techniques faces a significant barrier in privacy legislation, such as Brazil's
General Data Protection Law (LGPD), which restricts the centralization of
sensitive student data. To resolve this challenge, privacy-preserving
computational approaches are required. The present study evaluates the
feasibility and effectiveness of Federated Learning, specifically the FedProx
algorithm, to predict student performance using microdata from the Brazilian
Basic Education Assessment System (SAEB). A Deep Neural Network (DNN) model was
trained in a federated manner, simulating a scenario with 50 schools, and its
performance was rigorously benchmarked against a centralized eXtreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) model. The analysis, conducted on a universe of over two
million student records, revealed that the centralized model achieved an
accuracy of 63.96%. Remarkably, the federated model reached a peak accuracy of
61.23%, demonstrating a marginal performance loss in exchange for a robust

TL;DR: 本文提出三种改进LSTM的方法：输入重排序、权重归一化和门非线性化，在文本分类任务中提升了LSTM的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LSTM模型虽然通过门控机制处理长期信息，但仍存在不足：无法最优关注特定旧索引信息、缺乏权重归一化研究、门控非线性化不足。

Method: 1) 输入重排序方法优先处理特定输入索引；2) 通过监督损失函数选择最佳Lp范数进行权重归一化；3) 使用小型前馈神经网络对门控进行非线性化增强。

Result: 在文本分类任务中，所提出的方法相比简单LSTM模型提高了准确率。

Conclusion: 输入重排序、权重归一化和门非线性化三种方法能有效提升LSTM性能，特别是在处理长期信息和特定输入模式方面。

Abstract: LSTM models used in current Machine Learning literature and applications, has
a promising solution for permitting long term information using gating
mechanisms that forget and reduce effect of current input information. However,
even with this pipeline, they do not optimally focus on specific old index or
long-term information. This paper elaborates upon input reordering approaches
to prioritize certain input indices. Moreover, no LSTM based approach is found
in the literature that examines weight normalization while choosing the right
weight and exponent of Lp norms through main supervised loss function. In this
paper, we find out which norm best finds relationship between weights to either
smooth or sparsify them. Lastly, gates, as weighted representations of inputs
and states, which control reduction-extent of current input versus previous
inputs (~ state), are not nonlinearized enough (through a small FFNN). As
analogous to attention mechanisms, gates easily filter current information to
bold (emphasize on) past inputs. Nonlinearized gates can more easily tune up to
peculiar nonlinearities of specific input in the past. This type of
nonlinearization is not proposed in the literature, to the best of author's
knowledge. The proposed approaches are implemented and compared with a simple
LSTM to understand their performance in text classification tasks. The results
show they improve accuracy of LSTM.

TL;DR: 提出协作集成对抗训练(CEAT)，通过子模型间的预测差异自适应加权样本，增强集成模型的对抗鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集成对抗训练方法独立训练子模型，忽略了子模型间的协作优势，分类差异大的样本对集成鲁棒性影响更大

Method: 利用子模型间的概率差异自适应分配样本权重，加入校准距离正则化，使预测差异大的样本在其他子模型训练中获得更多关注

Result: 在广泛采用的数据集上达到最先进性能，优于现有竞争性EAT方法

Conclusion: CEAT是模型无关的方法，可无缝适配各种集成方法，具有灵活的适用性

Abstract: Ensemble Adversarial Training (EAT) attempts to enhance the robustness of
models against adversarial attacks by leveraging multiple models. However,
current EAT strategies tend to train the sub-models independently, ignoring the
cooperative benefits between sub-models. Through detailed inspections of the
process of EAT, we find that that samples with classification disparities
between sub-models are close to the decision boundary of ensemble, exerting
greater influence on the robustness of ensemble. To this end, we propose a
novel yet efficient Collaborative Ensemble Adversarial Training (CEAT), to
highlight the cooperative learning among sub-models in the ensemble. To be
specific, samples with larger predictive disparities between the sub-models
will receive greater attention during the adversarial training of the other
sub-models. CEAT leverages the probability disparities to adaptively assign
weights to different samples, by incorporating a calibrating distance
regularization. Extensive experiments on widely-adopted datasets show that our
proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance over competitive EAT
methods. It is noteworthy that CEAT is model-agnostic, which can be seamlessly
adapted into various ensemble methods with flexible applicability.

Abstract: The rise of powerful generative models has sparked concerns over data
authenticity. While detection methods have been extensively developed for
images and text, the case of tabular data, despite its ubiquity, has been
largely overlooked. Yet, detecting synthetic tabular data is especially
challenging due to its heterogeneous structure and unseen formats at test time.
We address the underexplored task of detecting synthetic tabular data in the
wild, where tables have variable and previously unseen schemas. We introduce a
novel datum-wise transformer architecture that significantly outperforms the
only previously published baseline, improving both AUC and accuracy by 7
points. By incorporating a table-adaptation component, our model gains an
additional 7 accuracy points, demonstrating enhanced robustness. This work
provides the first strong evidence that detecting synthetic tabular data in
real-world conditions is not only feasible, but can be done with high
reliability.

Abstract: Traditional budget allocation models struggle with the stochastic and
nonlinear nature of real-world financial data. This study proposes a hybrid
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for dynamic budget allocation, enhanced
with Dirichlet-inspired stochasticity and quantum mutation-based genetic
optimization. Using Apple Inc. quarterly financial data (2009 to 2025), the RL
agent learns to allocate budgets between Research and Development and Selling,
General and Administrative to maximize profitability while adhering to
historical spending patterns, with L2 penalties discouraging unrealistic
deviations. A Dirichlet distribution governs state evolution to simulate
shifting financial contexts. To escape local minima and improve generalization,
the trained policy is refined using genetic algorithms with quantum mutation
via parameterized qubit rotation circuits. Generation-wise rewards and
penalties are logged to visualize convergence and policy behavior. On unseen
fiscal data, the model achieves high alignment with actual allocations (cosine
similarity 0.9990, KL divergence 0.0023), demonstrating the promise of
combining deep RL, stochastic modeling, and quantum-inspired heuristics for
adaptive enterprise budgeting.

TL;DR: 该论文发现神经网络剪枝会破坏LLM内部用于谎言检测的关键激活特征，提出了TPLO方法在剪枝时重点保护包含异常值和判别性特征的层，从而在保持模型性能的同时保留谎言检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM剪枝方法虽然能在低资源场景下保持下游任务性能，但会破坏模型内部用于谎言检测的关键激活特征，这引发了如何在不牺牲谎言检测能力的前提下进行剪枝的重要问题。

Method: 提出了Truthful Pruning aligned by Layer-wise Outliers (TPLO)方法，通过同时关注具有更多激活异常值和更强判别性特征的层来进行剪枝，并引入了提示规则来丰富TruthfulQA基准以更好地校准LLM剪枝。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在50%稀疏度下实现了88%的幻觉检测准确率，显著提升了剪枝后LLM在TruthfulQA上的性能表现。

Conclusion: TPLO方法成功解决了LLM剪枝与谎言检测能力之间的权衡问题，能够在保持模型原始性能的同时保留内部状态的关键特征，为鲁棒的谎言检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Neural network pruning has emerged as a promising approach for deploying LLMs
in low-resource scenarios while preserving downstream task performance.
However, for the first time, we reveal that such pruning disrupts LLMs'
internal activation features crucial for lie detection, where probing
classifiers (typically small logistic regression models) trained on these
features assess the truthfulness of LLM-generated statements. This discovery
raises a crucial open question: how can we prune LLMs without sacrificing these
critical lie detection capabilities? Our investigation further reveals that
naively adjusting layer-wise pruning sparsity based on importance inadvertently
removes crucial weights, failing to improve lie detection performance despite
its reliance on the most crucial LLM layer. To address this issue, we propose
Truthful Pruning aligned by Layer-wise Outliers (TPLO), which places greater
emphasis on layers with more activation outliers and stronger discriminative
features simultaneously. This preserves LLMs' original performance while
retaining critical features of inner states needed for robust lie detection.
Moreover, we introduce a prompting rule to enrich the TruthfulQA benchmark for
better calibrating LLM pruning. Empirical results show that our approach
improves the hallucination detection for pruned LLMs (achieving 88% accuracy at
50% sparsity) and enhances their performance on TruthfulQA.

Motivation: 传统STE方法忽视了连续值与量化值之间的离散化错误，导致极低位宽量化时精度下降

Method: 提出PEGE方法，通过对数课程驱动的混合精度替换策略，将QAT形成为预测损失和量化错误的协同优化问题

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet上的实验显示，PEGE在各种网络结构上都超过现有方法，能让低精度模型达到或超过全精度模型的精度

Conclusion: PEGE提供了一种统一且可通用的STE替代方案，能够有效减少量化过程中的精度损失

Abstract: Neural network quantization aims to reduce the bit-widths of weights and
activations, making it a critical technique for deploying deep neural networks
on resource-constrained hardware. Most Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
methods rely on the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) to address the
non-differentiability of discretization functions by replacing their
derivatives with that of the identity function. While effective, STE overlooks
discretization errors between continuous and quantized values, which can lead
to accuracy degradation -- especially at extremely low bit-widths. In this
paper, we propose Progressive Element-wise Gradient Estimation (PEGE), a simple
yet effective alternative to STE, which can be seamlessly integrated with any
forward propagation methods and improves the quantized model accuracy. PEGE
progressively replaces full-precision weights and activations with their
quantized counterparts via a novel logarithmic curriculum-driven
mixed-precision replacement strategy. Then it formulates QAT as a
co-optimization problem that simultaneously minimizes the task loss for
prediction and the discretization error for quantization, providing a unified
and generalizable framework. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet
across various architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG) demonstrate that PEGE
consistently outperforms existing backpropagation methods and enables
low-precision models to match or even outperform the accuracy of their
full-precision counterparts.

Conclusion: 提出了一个协同计算范式，弥合了经典AI和量子计算之间的差距，为大规模实际优化挑战提供了可行的解决方案路径，显著降低了使用门槛

Abstract: Quantum annealing offers a promising paradigm for solving NP-hard
combinatorial optimization problems, but its practical application is severely
hindered by two challenges: the complex, manual process of translating problem
descriptions into the requisite Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization
(QUBO) format and the scalability limitations of current quantum hardware. To
address these obstacles, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, LLM-QUBO,
that automates this entire formulation-to-solution pipeline. Our system
leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to parse natural language, automatically
generating a structured mathematical representation. To overcome hardware
limitations, we integrate a hybrid quantum-classical Benders' decomposition
method. This approach partitions the problem, compiling the combinatorial
complex master problem into a compact QUBO format, while delegating linearly
structured sub-problems to classical solvers. The correctness of the generated
QUBO and the scalability of the hybrid approach are validated using classical
solvers, establishing a robust performance baseline and demonstrating the
framework's readiness for quantum hardware. Our primary contribution is a
synergistic computing paradigm that bridges classical AI and quantum computing,
addressing key challenges in the practical application of optimization problem.
This automated workflow significantly reduces the barrier to entry, providing a
viable pathway to transform quantum devices into accessible accelerators for
large-scale, real-world optimization challenges.

Method: 使用1D ViT进行掩码预训练，下游任务中通过门控网络选择性融合各层表示，并在预训练阶段引入分组平均聚合

Result: 提升了ECG下游应用的表示能力和性能表现

Conclusion: PMA方法有效利用了Transformer各层表示，为ECG基础模型提供了更好的表示学习方案

Abstract: Transformer-based foundation models for Electrocardiograms (ECGs) have
recently achieved impressive performance in many downstream applications.
However, the internal representations of such models across layers have not
been fully understood and exploited. An important question arises: Does the
final layer of the pre-trained Transformer model, the \emph{de facto}
representational layer, provide optimal performance for downstream tasks?
Although our answer based on empirical and theoretical analyses for this
question is negative, we propose a novel approach to leverage the
representation diversity of the model's layers effectively. Specifically, we
introduce a novel architecture called Post-pretraining Mixture-of-layers
Aggregation (PMA), which enables a flexible combination of the layer-wise
representations from the layer stack of a Transformer-based foundation model.
We first pre-train the model from ECG signals using the 1-dimensional Vision
Transformer (ViT) via masked modeling. In downstream applications, instead of
relying solely on the last layer of the model, we employ a gating network to
selectively fuse the representations from the pretrained model's layers,
thereby enhancing representation power and improving performance of the
downstream applications. In addition, we extend the proposed method to the
pretraining stage by aggregating all representations through group-wise
averaging before feeding them into the decoder-based Transformer.

Method: 使用6个完全枚举的分类反应数据集（768-5,684个实验），比较LLM引导优化与贝叶斯优化和随机采样的性能，并引入拓扑无关的信息论框架量化采样多样性。

Result: 前沿LLM在5个单目标数据集上一致匹配或超越贝叶斯优化性能，优势随参数复杂性增加和高性能条件稀缺性（<5%空间）而增长，LLM在所有数据集中保持系统更高的探索熵。

Conclusion: LLM引导优化在传统方法难以处理的复杂分类空间（需要领域理解而非数学优化）中表现出色，预训练领域知识实现了更有效的化学参数空间导航。

Abstract: Modern optimization in experimental chemistry employs algorithmic search
through black-box parameter spaces. Here we demonstrate that pre-trained
knowledge in large language models (LLMs) fundamentally changes this paradigm.
Using six fully enumerated categorical reaction datasets (768 - 5,684
experiments), we benchmark LLM-guided optimization (LLM-GO) against Bayesian
optimization (BO) and random sampling. Frontier LLMs consistently match or
exceed BO performance across five single-objective datasets, with advantages
growing as parameter complexity increases and high-performing conditions become
scarce (<5% of space). BO retains superiority only for explicit multi-objective
trade-offs. To understand these contrasting behaviors, we introduce a
topology-agnostic information theory framework quantifying sampling diversity
throughout optimization campaigns. This analysis reveals that LLMs maintain
systematically higher exploration entropy than BO across all datasets while
achieving superior performance, with advantages most pronounced in
solution-scarce parameter spaces where high-entropy exploration typically fails
- suggesting that pre-trained domain knowledge enables more effective
navigation of chemical parameter space rather than replacing structured
exploration strategies. To enable transparent benchmarking and community
validation, we release Iron Mind (https://gomes.andrew.cmu.edu/iron-mind), a
no-code platform for side-by-side evaluation of human, algorithmic, and LLM
optimization campaigns with public leaderboards and complete trajectories. Our
findings establish that LLM-GO excels precisely where traditional methods
struggle: complex categorical spaces requiring domain understanding rather than
mathematical optimization.

Abstract: Recent progress in deep learning has been driven by increasingly larger
models. However, their computational and energy demands have grown
proportionally, creating significant barriers to their deployment and to a
wider adoption of deep learning technologies. This thesis investigates
principled approximation methods for improving the efficiency of deep learning
systems, with a particular focus on settings that involve discrete constraints
and non-differentiability.
  We study three main approaches toward improved efficiency: architecture
design, model compression, and optimization. For model compression, we propose
novel approximations for pruning and quantization that frame the underlying
discrete problem as continuous and differentiable, enabling gradient-based
training of compression schemes alongside the model's parameters. These
approximations allow for fine-grained sparsity and precision configurations,
leading to highly compact models without significant fine-tuning. In the
context of architecture design, we design an algorithm for neural architecture
search that leverages parameter sharing across layers to efficiently explore
implicitly recurrent architectures. Finally, we study adaptive optimization,
revisiting theoretical properties of widely used methods and proposing an
adaptive optimizer that allows for quick hyperparameter tuning.
  Our contributions center on tackling computationally hard problems via
scalable and principled approximations. Experimental results on image
classification, language modeling, and generative modeling tasks show that the
proposed methods provide significant improvements in terms of training and
inference efficiency while maintaining, or even improving, the model's
performance.

Abstract: Data-driven modeling of constrained multibody systems faces two persistent
challenges: high computational cost and limited long-term prediction accuracy.
To address these issues, we introduce the Flow-Matching Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (FNODE), a framework that learns acceleration vector
fields directly from trajectory data. By reformulating the training objective
to supervise accelerations rather than integrated states, FNODE eliminates the
need for backpropagation through an ODE solver, which represents a bottleneck
in traditional Neural ODEs. Acceleration targets are computed efficiently using
numerical differentiation techniques, including a hybrid Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) and Finite Difference (FD) scheme. We evaluate FNODE on a diverse set of
benchmarks, including the single and triple mass-spring-damper systems, double
pendulum, slider-crank, and cart-pole. Across all cases, FNODE consistently
outperforms existing approaches such as Multi-Body Dynamic Neural ODE
(MBD-NODE), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Fully Connected Neural

Motivation: 边缘设备部署AI代理对隐私和响应性至关重要，但内存限制迫使使用推理能力较差的小型LLM。现有测试时缩放方法在边缘硬件上开销过大，需要解决这一瓶颈。

Method: 提出三项优化技术：1)推测性波束扩展缓解系统瓶颈；2)非对称多模型内存分配动态平衡内存使用；3)动态前缀感知调度最大化KV缓存重用。基于vLLM构建即插即用库。

Conclusion: FlashTTS为在边缘设备上实现高性能、民主化的AI代理铺平了道路，解决了内存约束下测试时缩放的实际应用问题。

Abstract: Deploying agentic AI on edge devices is crucial for privacy and
responsiveness, but memory constraints typically relegate these systems to
smaller Large Language Models (LLMs) with inferior reasoning capabilities.
Test-Time Scaling (TTS) can bridge this reasoning gap by dedicating more
compute during inference, but existing methods incur prohibitive overhead on
edge hardware. To overcome this, we introduce FlashTTS, a serving system that
makes TTS practical for memory-constrained LLM reasoning. FlashTTS introduces
three synergistic optimizations: (i) Speculative Beam Extension to mitigate
system stragglers from irregular reasoning paths; (ii) Asymmetric Multi-Model
Memory Allocation to dynamically balance memory between generation and
verification; and (iii) Dynamic Prefix-Aware Scheduling to maximize KV-cache
reuse. Built as a plug-and-play library for vLLM, FlashTTS enables edge LLMs on
a single consumer GPU (24 GB) to match the accuracy and latency of large cloud
models. Our evaluation demonstrates that FlashTTS achieves an average 2.2x
higher goodput and reduces latency by 38%-68% compared to a vLLM baseline,
paving the way for democratized, high-performance agentic AI on edge devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的自回归推理存在KV缓存线性增长和O(N^2 d)计算复杂度的问题，严重限制了其处理超长序列的能力，需要新的架构来解决这些限制。

Method: 基于TLinFormer工作，采用创新的周期性状态更新机制，在k-1个连续步骤中执行恒定时间计算，仅在第k步执行一次线性时间的全局信息同步，实现摊销意义上的O(1)计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 这一突破为高效和鲁棒的流式语言模型应用铺平了道路，解决了长序列处理的核心瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Although the Transformer has become the cornerstone of modern AI, its
autoregressive inference suffers from a linearly growing KV Cache and a
computational complexity of O(N^2 d), severely hindering its ability to process
ultra-long sequences. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the
TConstFormer architecture, building upon our previous work, TLinFormer.
TConstFormer employs an innovative periodic state update mechanism to achieve a
truly constant-size O(1) KV Cache. The computational complexity of this
mechanism is also O(1) in an amortized sense: it performs purely constant-time
computations for $k-1$ consecutive steps (e.g., $k=256$) and executes a single
linear-time global information synchronization only on the $k$-th step.
Theoretical calculations and experimental results demonstrate that TConstFormer
exhibits an overwhelming advantage over baseline models in terms of speed,
memory efficiency, and overall performance on long-text inference tasks. This
breakthrough paves the way for efficient and robust streaming language model
applications.

Abstract: Parameterized partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin the mathematical
modeling of complex systems in diverse domains, including engineering,
healthcare, and physics. A central challenge in using PDEs for real-world
applications is to accurately infer the parameters, particularly when the
parameters exhibit non-linear and spatiotemporal variations. Existing parameter
estimation methods, such as sparse identification and physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs), struggle in such cases, especially with nonlinear dynamics,
multiphysics interactions, or limited observations of the system response. To
address these challenges, we introduce Neptune, a general-purpose method
capable of inferring parameter fields from sparse measurements of system
responses. Neptune employs independent coordinate neural networks to
continuously represent each parameter field in physical space or in state
variables. Across various physical and biomedical problems, where direct
parameter measurements are prohibitively expensive or unattainable, Neptune

*Ruokai Yin,Sattwik Deb Mishra,Xuan Zuo,Hokchhay Tann,Preyas Shah,Apala Guha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Learn to Shard是一个基于强化学习的分布式LLM推理优化方法，通过联合优化粗粒度并行度和细粒度算子分片维度，在H100集群上实现最高3.5倍的吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前系统如Megatron-LM使用静态启发式方法分别配置并行度和算子分片维度，随着模型规模扩大和硬件拓扑多样化，这种方法无法充分利用性能潜力。

Method: 采用基于注意力的强化学习策略，从高性能策略历史中学习，有效探索巨大的组合搜索空间，联合优化粗粒度并行度和细粒度算子分片维度。

Result: 在H100集群上测试1.6T参数的MoE模型，相比元启发式基线获得最高3.5倍吞吐量提升，相比Megatron启发式方法获得1.06倍提升。

Conclusion: Learn to Shard证明了强化学习方法在分布式LLM推理优化中的有效性，能够显著提升大规模模型推理性能。

Abstract: Distributed LLM inference requires careful coordination of parallelization
strategies across hundreds to thousands of NPUs to meet production SLOs.
Current systems like Megatron-LM rely on static heuristics that separately
configure parallelism degrees and per-operator sharding dimensions, leaving
significant performance on the table as models scale and hardware topologies
diversify. We introduce Learn to Shard, to our knowledge, the first RL-based
approach to co-optimize both coarse-grained parallelism degrees and
fine-grained per-operator sharding dimensions for distributed LLM inference.
Our method employs an attention-based policy over an elite history that learns
from high-performing strategies to efficiently navigate the vast combinatorial
search space. Evaluated on H100 clusters with MoE models up to 1.6T parameters,
Learn to Shard achieves up to 3.5x throughput improvement over metaheuristic
baselines and 1.06x over Megatron heuristics.

Motivation: 探索语音基础模型学习到的表征是否具有领域无关性，能否应用于可穿戴传感器时间序列分析任务，以解决数据稀缺的时间序列任务性能问题。

Method: 使用HuBERT和wav2vec 2.0语音基础模型提取特征，然后在这些特征上训练简单的探测分类器，应用于可穿戴传感器的情绪分类、心律失常检测和活动分类任务。

Result: 语音模型提取的特征在传感器时间序列任务上表现优于直接在特定模态数据集上训练的自监督模型，特别是卷积特征编码器显示出很强的相关性。

Conclusion: 语音基础模型学习到的表征具有领域独立性，可以显著提升数据稀缺时间序列任务的性能和鲁棒性，为构建通用的语音和传感器时间序列模型迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Both speech and sensor time series data encode information in both the time-
and frequency- domains, like spectral powers and waveform shapelets. We show
that speech foundation models learn representations that are domain-independent
and achieve state-of-the-art performance on time series tasks from wearable
sensors. Probes trained on features extracted from HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0
outperform those extracted from self-supervised models trained directly on
modality specific datasets for mood classification, arrhythmia detection, and
activity classification tasks. We find a particularly strong relevance of the
convolutional feature encoders from speech models for wearable sensor tasks.
The methods proposed here improve performance and robustness for data-scarce
time series tasks, using simple probing methods. This work is a step towards
generalized time series models for speech and sensor data, a topic for further
exploration.

TL;DR: 提出量子优化选择性状态空间模型(Q-SSM)，结合状态空间模型和变分量子门，通过量子门控机制自适应调节记忆更新，解决长时序预测中的非平稳性和多尺度依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer模型存在二次复杂度问题，状态空间模型训练不稳定且对初始化敏感。需要一种既能捕捉长程依赖又保持计算效率的稳健方法。

Method: 使用参数化量子电路(RY-RX ansatz)的期望值来自适应调节状态空间模型的内存更新，替代昂贵的注意力机制，实现线性时间复杂度的量子门控。

Result: 在ETT、Traffic和Exchange Rate三个基准测试中，Q-SSM consistently优于LSTM、TCN、Reformer、Transformer和S-Mamba等基线模型。

Conclusion: 变分量子门控能有效解决长程预测的现有局限，实现准确稳健的多变量预测，为时序分析提供了轻量级量子优化方案。

Abstract: Long-range time series forecasting remains challenging, as it requires
capturing non-stationary and multi-scale temporal dependencies while
maintaining noise robustness, efficiency, and stability. Transformer-based
architectures such as Autoformer and Informer improve generalization but suffer
from quadratic complexity and degraded performance on very long time horizons.
State space models, notably S-Mamba, provide linear-time updates but often face
unstable training dynamics, sensitivity to initialization, and limited
robustness for multivariate forecasting. To address such challenges, we propose
the Quantum-Optimized Selective State Space Model (Q-SSM), a hybrid
quantum-optimized approach that integrates state space dynamics with a
variational quantum gate. Instead of relying on expensive attention mechanisms,
Q-SSM employs a simple parametrized quantum circuit (RY-RX ansatz) whose
expectation values regulate memory updates adaptively. This quantum gating
mechanism improves convergence stability, enhances the modeling of long-term
dependencies, and provides a lightweight alternative to attention. We
empirically validate Q-SSM on three widely used benchmarks, i.e., ETT, Traffic,
and Exchange Rate. Results show that Q-SSM consistently improves over strong
baselines (LSTM, TCN, Reformer), Transformer-based models, and S-Mamba. These
findings demonstrate that variational quantum gating can address current
limitations in long-range forecasting, leading to accurate and robust
multivariate predictions.

Conclusion: ReLATE框架通过自适应学习能够有效处理不规则张量形状和数据分布，为稀疏张量计算提供了自动化的高效编码解决方案

Abstract: Tensor decomposition (TD) is essential for analyzing high-dimensional sparse
data, yet its irregular computations and memory-access patterns pose major
performance challenges on modern parallel processors. Prior works rely on
expert-designed sparse tensor formats that fail to adapt to irregular tensor
shapes and/or highly variable data distributions. We present the
reinforcement-learned adaptive tensor encoding (ReLATE) framework, a novel
learning-augmented method that automatically constructs efficient sparse tensor
representations without labeled training samples. ReLATE employs an autonomous
agent that discovers optimized tensor encodings through direct interaction with
the TD environment, leveraging a hybrid model-free and model-based algorithm to
learn from both real and imagined actions. Moreover, ReLATE introduces
rule-driven action masking and dynamics-informed action filtering mechanisms
that ensure functionally correct tensor encoding with bounded execution time,
even during early learning stages. By automatically adapting to both irregular
tensor shapes and data distributions, ReLATE generates sparse tensor
representations that consistently outperform expert-designed formats across
diverse sparse tensor data sets, achieving up to 2X speedup compared to the
best sparse format, with a geometric-mean speedup of 1.4-1.46X.

Result: 经验验证显示改进的采样器性能，由扩展探索驱动

Conclusion: 连续调温扩散采样器通过改进提案分布，有效解决了神经采样器探索不足的问题

Abstract: Annealing-based neural samplers seek to amortize sampling from unnormalized
distributions by training neural networks to transport a family of densities
interpolating from source to target. A crucial design choice in the training
phase of such samplers is the proposal distribution by which locations are
generated at which to evaluate the loss. Previous work has obtained such a
proposal distribution by combining a partially learned transport with annealed
Langevin dynamics. However, isolated modes and other pathological properties of
the annealing path imply that such proposals achieve insufficient exploration
and thereby lower performance post training. To remedy this, we propose
continuously tempered diffusion samplers, which leverage exploration techniques
developed in the context of molecular dynamics to improve proposal
distributions. Specifically, a family of distributions across different
temperatures is introduced to lower energy barriers at higher temperatures and
drive exploration at the lower temperature of interest. We empirically validate
improved sampler performance driven by extended exploration. Code is available

TL;DR: TabPFN v2在多个表格数据基准测试中优于基于树的模型，但受限于Transformer的二次计算和内存成本，无法处理超过10K上下文标记。本文提出了一种tiled-block策略来计算注意力，使TabPFN能够无需预处理即可处理长上下文。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决TabPFN v2因Transformer二次计算复杂度而无法处理长上下文（超过10K标记）的问题，现有方法依赖上下文压缩（如KNN选择代表性样本），但需要预处理。

Method: 引入tiled-block策略在TabPFN框架内计算注意力，该设计与标准GPU设置兼容，是首个无需预处理即可让TabPFN处理长上下文的方法。

Result: 在标准TabArena基准测试中证明了该方法的有效性，能够处理更长的上下文而不损失性能。

Conclusion: 提出的tiled-block策略成功解决了TabPFN处理长上下文的限制，无需预处理即可实现，在标准基准测试中表现有效。

Abstract: TabPFN v2 achieves better results than tree-based models on several tabular
benchmarks, which is notable since tree-based models are usually the strongest
choice for tabular data. However, it cannot handle more than 10K context tokens
because transformers have quadratic computation and memory costs.
  Unlike existing approaches that rely on context compression, such as
selecting representative samples via K-nearest neighbors (KNN), we introduce a
\textbf{tiled-block} strategy to compute attention within the TabPFN framework.
This design is compatible with standard GPU setups and, to the best of our
knowledge, is the first to enable TabPFN to \textbf{process long contexts
without any pre-processing}. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
on the standard TabArena benchmark.

Conclusion: 该方法为现实推荐场景中的反事实学习和评估提供了实用指导，能够更好地处理曝光偏差问题

Abstract: Learning and evaluating recommender systems from logged implicit feedback is
challenging due to exposure bias. While inverse propensity scoring (IPS)
corrects this bias, it often suffers from high variance and instability. In
this paper, we present a simple and effective pipeline that integrates
IPS-weighted training with an IPS-weighted Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)
objective augmented by a Propensity Regularizer (PR). We compare Direct Method
(DM), IPS, and Self-Normalized IPS (SNIPS) for offline policy evaluation, and
demonstrate how IPS-weighted training improves model robustness under biased
exposure. The proposed PR further mitigates variance amplification from extreme
propensity weights, leading to more stable estimates. Experiments on synthetic
and MovieLens 100K data show that our approach generalizes better under
unbiased exposure while reducing evaluation variance compared to naive and
standard IPS methods, offering practical guidance for counterfactual learning
and evaluation in real-world recommendation settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了对氛散模型的新理论视角，认为它们实际上是通过流匹配学习Wasserstein梯度流的速度场，而非传统理论所说的学习噪声数据的证明函数梯度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实践中的氛散模型网络并不遵守保守向量场的约束，这与传统理论认为它们学习证明函数梯度的假设相瞬翻。需要解释为何这些非保守的模型仍能成功地进行生成。

Method: 通过数值实验证明训练好的氛散网络违反了真正证明函数的积分和微分约束，并提出了一种新的理论视角：将氛散训练理解为向Wasserstein梯度流速度场的流匹配。

Result: 尽管神经网络学到的向量场并非真正的证明函数（非保守场），但模型仍能高效地进行生成。密度运输不一定因神经近似的非保守性误差而受损。

Conclusion: WGF视角为理论氛散生成模型提供了更原则性、雅致且理论基础坚实的框架，解释了为何非保守的神经向量场仍能成功进行生成。

Abstract: Diffusion models are commonly interpreted as learning the score function,
i.e., the gradient of the log-density of noisy data. However, this assumption
implies that the target of learning is a conservative vector field, which is
not enforced by the neural network architectures used in practice. We present
numerical evidence that trained diffusion networks violate both integral and
differential constraints required of true score functions, demonstrating that
the learned vector fields are not conservative. Despite this, the models
perform remarkably well as generative mechanisms. To explain this apparent
paradox, we advocate a new theoretical perspective: diffusion training is
better understood as flow matching to the velocity field of a Wasserstein
Gradient Flow (WGF), rather than as score learning for a reverse-time
stochastic differential equation. Under this view, the "probability flow"
arises naturally from the WGF framework, eliminating the need to invoke
reverse-time SDE theory and clarifying why generative sampling remains
successful even when the neural vector field is not a true score. We further
show that non-conservative errors from neural approximation do not necessarily
harm density transport. Our results advocate for adopting the WGF perspective
as a principled, elegant, and theoretically grounded framework for
understanding diffusion generative models.

Conclusion: LLMDPD通过整合语言模型和扩散模型有效解决了离线RL的泛化问题，为跨任务强化学习提供了新思路

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is known for its strong decision-making
capabilities and has been widely applied in various real-world scenarios.
However, with the increasing availability of offline datasets and the lack of
well-designed online environments from human experts, the challenge of
generalization in offline RL has become more prominent. Due to the limitations
of offline data, RL agents trained solely on collected experiences often
struggle to generalize to new tasks or environments. To address this challenge,
we propose LLM-Driven Policy Diffusion (LLMDPD), a novel approach that enhances
generalization in offline RL using task-specific prompts. Our method
incorporates both text-based task descriptions and trajectory prompts to guide
policy learning. We leverage a large language model (LLM) to process text-based
prompts, utilizing its natural language understanding and extensive knowledge
base to provide rich task-relevant context. Simultaneously, we encode
trajectory prompts using a transformer model, capturing structured behavioral
patterns within the underlying transition dynamics. These prompts serve as
conditional inputs to a context-aware policy-level diffusion model, enabling
the RL agent to generalize effectively to unseen tasks. Our experimental
results demonstrate that LLMDPD outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods
on unseen tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in improving generalization and
adaptability in diverse settings.

Result: 理论分析证明了PERL的三个优势确实存在数学基础，数值实验表明即使使用显著更少的训练样本，PERL仍能比纯神经网络获得更高的精度。

Conclusion: PERL方法通过结合物理模型和神经网络残差学习，在保持预测性能的同时显著减少数据需求，在自动驾驶等实际应用中具有重要价值，特别是在难以获取极端案例数据的场景中。

Abstract: Intensive studies have been conducted in recent years to integrate neural
networks with physics models to balance model accuracy and interpretability.
One recently proposed approach, named Physics-Enhanced Residual Learning
(PERL), is to use learning to estimate the residual between the physics model
prediction and the ground truth. Numeral examples suggested that integrating
such residual with physics models in PERL has three advantages: (1) a reduction
in the number of required neural network parameters; (2) faster convergence
rates; and (3) fewer training samples needed for the same computational
precision. However, these numerical results lack theoretical justification and
cannot be adequately explained.
  This paper aims to explain these advantages of PERL from a theoretical
perspective. We investigate a general class of problems with Lipschitz
continuity properties. By examining the relationships between the bounds to the
loss function and residual learning structure, this study rigorously proves a
set of theorems explaining the three advantages of PERL.
  Several numerical examples in the context of automated vehicle trajectory
prediction are conducted to illustrate the proposed theorems. The results
confirm that, even with significantly fewer training samples, PERL consistently
achieves higher accuracy than a pure neural network. These results demonstrate
the practical value of PERL in real world autonomous driving applications where
corner case data are costly or hard to obtain. PERL therefore improves
predictive performance while reducing the amount of data required.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有初始化方法（如He、Xavier、正交初始化）在深度ReLU网络中无法有效调节预激活均值和控制激活稀疏性，导致神经元永久失活（dying ReLU）和梯度不稳定问题。

Method: 在Stiefel流形上求解优化问题，推导出闭式解和高效采样方案，专门为ReLU激活函数优化正交初始化，从初始化阶段就保持尺度并校准预激活统计量。

Conclusion: 该方法显著改善了深度ReLU网络的训练稳定性，在信号和梯度流方面表现优异，适用于各种ReLU族激活函数和深度架构。

Abstract: Stable and efficient training of ReLU networks with large depth is highly
sensitive to weight initialization. Improper initialization can cause permanent
neuron inactivation dying ReLU and exacerbate gradient instability as network
depth increases. Methods such as He, Xavier, and orthogonal initialization
preserve variance or promote approximate isometry. However, they do not
necessarily regulate the pre-activation mean or control activation sparsity,
and their effectiveness often diminishes in very deep architectures. This work
introduces an orthogonal initialization specifically optimized for ReLU by
solving an optimization problem on the Stiefel manifold, thereby preserving
scale and calibrating the pre-activation statistics from the outset. A family
of closed-form solutions and an efficient sampling scheme are derived.
Theoretical analysis at initialization shows that prevention of the dying ReLU
problem, slower decay of activation variance, and mitigation of gradient
vanishing, which together stabilize signal and gradient flow in deep
architectures. Empirically, across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, multiple tabular
datasets, few-shot settings, and ReLU-family activations, our method
outperforms previous initializations and enables stable training in deep
networks.

Abstract: This paper studies the vulnerability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to
adversarial attacks on node features and graph structure. Various methods have
implemented adversarial training to augment graph data, aiming to bolster the
robustness and generalization of GNNs. These methods typically involve applying
perturbations to the node feature, weights, or graph structure and subsequently
minimizing the loss by learning more robust graph model parameters under the
adversarial perturbations. Despite the effectiveness of adversarial training in
enhancing GNNs' robustness and generalization abilities, its application has
been largely confined to specific datasets and GNN types. In this paper, we
propose a novel method, PerturbEmbedding, that integrates adversarial
perturbation and training, enhancing GNNs' resilience to such attacks and
improving their generalization ability. PerturbEmbedding performs perturbation
operations directly on every hidden embedding of GNNs and provides a unified
framework for most existing perturbation strategies/methods. We also offer a
unified perspective on the forms of perturbations, namely random and
adversarial perturbations. Through experiments on various datasets using
different backbone models, we demonstrate that PerturbEmbedding significantly
improves both the robustness and generalization abilities of GNNs,
outperforming existing methods. The rejection of both random (non-targeted) and
adversarial (targeted) perturbations further enhances the backbone model's
performance.

Conclusion: CUFL通过课程引导的个性化学习有效解决了子图联邦学习中的数据异构性问题，实现了更好的知识共享和个性化性能

Abstract: Subgraph Federated Learning (FL) aims to train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
across distributed private subgraphs, but it suffers from severe data
heterogeneity. To mitigate data heterogeneity, weighted model aggregation
personalizes each local GNN by assigning larger weights to parameters from
clients with similar subgraph characteristics inferred from their current model
states. However, the sparse and biased subgraphs often trigger rapid
overfitting, causing the estimated client similarity matrix to stagnate or even
collapse. As a result, aggregation loses effectiveness as clients reinforce
their own biases instead of exploiting diverse knowledge otherwise available.
To this end, we propose a novel personalized subgraph FL framework called
Curriculum guided personalized sUbgraph Federated Learning (CUFL). On the
client side, CUFL adopts Curriculum Learning (CL) that adaptively selects edges
for training according to their reconstruction scores, exposing each GNN first
to easier, generic cross-client substructures and only later to harder,
client-specific ones. This paced exposure prevents early overfitting to biased
patterns and enables gradual personalization. By regulating personalization,
the curriculum also reshapes server aggregation from exchanging generic
knowledge to propagating client-specific knowledge. Further, CUFL improves
weighted aggregation by estimating client similarity using fine-grained
structural indicators reconstructed on a random reference graph. Extensive
experiments on six benchmark datasets confirm that CUFL achieves superior
performance compared to relevant baselines. Code is available at

Result: 使用Metis后，FP8训练超越FP32基准性能，FP4训练达到与FP32相当的精度。

Conclusion: Metis为先进低比特量化下的稳健和可扩展LLM训练铺平了道路。

Abstract: This work identifies anisotropic parameter distributions as a fundamental
barrier to training large language models (LLMs) with low-bit quantization: a
few dominant singular values create wide numerical ranges that conflict with
the inherent bias of block-wise quantization. This bias disproportionately
preserves high-magnitude values while discarding smaller ones, causing training
instability and low model performance. This work introduces Metis, a training
framework that combines (i) spectral decomposition with random embedding to
efficiently disentangle dominant from long-tail components, compressing broad
distributions into quantization-friendly narrow ranges; (ii) adaptive learning
rates in the spectral domain to amplify underrepresented directions and better
capture diverse features critical for performance; and (iii) a dual-range
regularizer that jointly constrains numerical precision and parameter range
distribution, ensuring stable, unbiased low-bit training. With Metis, FP8
training surpasses FP32 baselines, and FP4 training achieves accuracy
comparable to FP32, paving the way for robust and scalable LLM training under
advanced low-bit quantization. The code implementation for Metis is available
at: https://github.com/typename-yyf/Metis-quantization.

Abstract: Partially observable restless multi-armed bandits have found numerous
applications including in recommendation systems, communication systems, public
healthcare outreach systems, and in operations research. We study multi-action
partially observable restless multi-armed bandits, it is a generalization of
the classical restless multi-armed bandit problem -- 1) each bandit has finite
states, and the current state is not observable, 2) each bandit has finite
actions. In particular, we assume that more than two actions are available for
each bandit. We motivate our problem with the application of public-health
intervention planning. We describe the model and formulate a long term
discounted optimization problem, where the state of each bandit evolves
according to a Markov process, and this evolution is action dependent. The
state of a bandit is not observable but one of finitely many feedback signals
are observable. Each bandit yields a reward, based on the action taken on that
bandit. The agent is assumed to have a budget constraint. The bandits are
assumed to be independent. However, they are weakly coupled at the agent
through the budget constraint.
  We first analyze the Lagrangian bound method for our partially observable
restless bandits. The computation of optimal value functions for finite-state,
finite-action POMDPs is non-trivial. Hence, the computation of Lagrangian
bounds is also challenging. We describe approximations for the computation of
Lagrangian bounds using point based value iteration (PBVI) and online rollout
policy. We further present various properties of the value functions and
provide theoretical insights on PBVI and online rollout policy. We study
heuristic policies for multi-actions PORMAB. Finally, we discuss present
Whittle index policies and their limitations in our model.

TL;DR: 本文证明了Transformer的记忆能力随提示长度线性增长，并首次形式化证明了大型语言模型中观察到的性能退化现象，揭示了Transformer固有的有限记忆限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管提示调优在实证上成功，但其理论分析仍然有限。现有工作主要关注通用逼近性质，本文旨在探索Transformer的记忆能力这一不同理论方面。

Method: 通过理论分析证明两个主要贡献：1）Transformer记忆信息量不能快于提示长度线性增长；2）形式化证明大型语言模型中观察到的扩展上下文性能退化现象。

Result: 证明了Transformer具有固有的有限记忆能力，无论上下文大小如何，其记忆信息量都受到限制，这解释了长序列处理能力的局限性。

Conclusion: 研究提供了对Transformer架构内在限制的基本理解，特别是其处理长序列的能力，为理解大型语言模型的记忆限制提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Despite the empirical success of prompt tuning in adapting pretrained
language models to new tasks, theoretical analyses of its capabilities remain
limited. Existing theoretical work primarily addresses universal approximation
properties, demonstrating results comparable to standard weight tuning. In this
paper, we explore a different aspect of the theory of transformers: the
memorization capability of prompt tuning. We provide two principal theoretical
contributions. First, we prove that the amount of information memorized by a
transformer cannot scale faster than linearly with the prompt length. Second,
and more importantly, we present the first formal proof of a phenomenon
empirically observed in large language models: performance degradation in
transformers with extended contexts. We rigorously demonstrate that
transformers inherently have limited memory, constraining the amount of
information they can retain, regardless of the context size. This finding
offers a fundamental understanding of the intrinsic limitations of transformer
architectures, particularly their ability to handle long sequences.

<details>

Motivation: 输入相关的激活稀疏性是深度学习模型的重要特性，但现有方法主要针对ReLU激活函数，无法直接迁移到使用其他激活函数的现代大语言模型，导致当前研究碎片化且缺乏共识。

Method: 提出了一个评估稀疏性鲁棒性的通用框架，系统研究了包括扩散LLM在内的现代大语言模型FFN层中的激活稀疏性现象。

Result: 发现了LLM中激活稀疏性的普遍模式，为理解这一现象提供了深刻见解。

Conclusion: 研究结果为模型设计和加速中利用激活稀疏性提供了实用指南，填补了现代LLM激活稀疏性研究的空白。

Abstract: Input-dependent activation sparsity is a notable property of deep learning
models, which has been extensively studied in networks with ReLU activations
and is associated with efficiency, robustness, and interpretability. However,
the approaches developed for ReLU-based models depend on exact zero activations
and do not transfer directly to modern large language models~(LLMs), which have
abandoned ReLU in favor of other activation functions. As a result, current
work on activation sparsity in LLMs is fragmented, model-specific, and lacks
consensus on which components to target. We propose a general framework to
assess sparsity robustness and present a systematic study of the phenomenon in
the FFN layers of modern LLMs, including diffusion LLMs. Our findings reveal
universal patterns of activation sparsity in LLMs, provide insights into this
phenomenon, and offer practical guidelines for exploiting it in model design
and acceleration.

Motivation: 图像自回归模型在生成图像方面表现出色，但也存在记忆训练数据的问题，这可能带来隐私风险。研究旨在探索记忆化发生的具体位置和方式。

Method: 通过细粒度记忆化测量方法，分析不同图像自回归架构中的记忆化模式，包括分层逐分辨率架构和标准逐令牌预测架构。

Result: 发现分层架构中记忆化早期出现并随分辨率加深，而标准架构中记忆化集中在后期处理阶段。通过干预最记忆化组件，显著减少了数据提取能力，且对生成图像质量影响最小。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了图像生成模型的内部行为特征，为减轻隐私风险提供了实用策略，表明可以通过针对性干预来平衡模型性能与隐私保护。

Abstract: Image AutoRegressive (IAR) models have achieved state-of-the-art performance
in speed and quality of generated images. However, they also raise concerns
about memorization of their training data and its implications for privacy.
This work explores where and how such memorization occurs within different
image autoregressive architectures by measuring a fine-grained memorization.
The analysis reveals that memorization patterns differ across various
architectures of IARs. In hierarchical per-resolution architectures, it tends
to emerge early and deepen with resolutions, while in IARs with standard
autoregressive per token prediction, it concentrates in later processing
stages. These localization of memorization patterns are further connected to
IARs' ability to memorize and leak training data. By intervening on their most
memorizing components, we significantly reduce the capacity for data extraction
from IARs with minimal impact on the quality of generated images. These
findings offer new insights into the internal behavior of image generative
models and point toward practical strategies for mitigating privacy risks.

Conclusion: PSIRAGCN通过交互融合框架和区域感知机制，有效提升了交通预测性能，解决了现有方法在时空相关性建模和区域异质性处理方面的局限性。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is significant for urban traffic management, intelligent
route planning, and real-time flow monitoring. Recent advances in
spatial-temporal models have markedly improved the modeling of intricate
spatial-temporal correlations for traffic forecasting. Unfortunately, most
previous studies have encountered challenges in effectively modeling
spatial-temporal correlations across various perceptual perspectives, which
have neglected the interactive fusion between traffic patterns and spatial
correlations. Additionally, constrained by spatial heterogeneity, most studies
fail to consider distinct regional heterogeneity during message-passing. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a Pattern-Spatial Interactive and
Regional Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (PSIRAGCN) for traffic
forecasting. Specifically, we propose a pattern-spatial interactive fusion
framework composed of pattern and spatial modules. This framework aims to
capture patterns and spatial correlations by adopting a perception perspective
from the global to the local level and facilitating mutual utilization with
positive feedback. In the spatial module, we designed a graph convolutional
network based on message-passing. The network is designed to leverage a
regional characteristics bank to reconstruct data-driven message-passing with
regional awareness. Reconstructed message passing can reveal the regional
heterogeneity between nodes in the traffic network. Extensive experiments on
three real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that PSIRAGCN outperforms the
State-of-the-art baseline while balancing computational costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习模型将基因视为无结构标记或把通路当作"基因袋"处理，忽略了已知的通路拓扑结构和基因-基因相互作用信息。

Method: 使用图注意力网络（GAT）在基因级别建模通路，通过边干预编码药物机制，提升模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在未见治疗条件下预测通路动态时，GAT相比MLP实现81%的MSE降低；成功从原始时间序列mRNA数据中重新发现TP53-MDM2-MDM4反馈环的所有五个基因相互作用。

Conclusion: GAT框架能更好地利用生物通路的结构信息，具有直接从实验数据生成新生物学假设的潜力。

Abstract: Biological pathways map gene-gene interactions that govern all human
processes. Despite their importance, most ML models treat genes as unstructured
tokens, discarding known pathway structure. The latest pathway-informed models
capture pathway-pathway interactions, but still treat each pathway as a "bag of
genes" via MLPs, discarding its topology and gene-gene interactions. We propose
a Graph Attention Network (GAT) framework that models pathways at the gene
level. We show that GATs generalize much better than MLPs, achieving an 81%
reduction in MSE when predicting pathway dynamics under unseen treatment
conditions. We further validate the correctness of our biological prior by
encoding drug mechanisms via edge interventions, boosting model robustness.
Finally, we show that our GAT model is able to correctly rediscover all five
gene-gene interactions in the canonical TP53-MDM2-MDM4 feedback loop from raw
time-series mRNA data, demonstrating potential to generate novel biological
hypotheses directly from experimental data.

Motivation: 现有联邦学习攻击策略仅破坏全局模型性能，但攻击者自身模型也会受损。现实中攻击者追求竞争优势，希望自己的模型优于其他参与者

Method: FedThief框架：上传阶段修改内容降低全局模型性能；同时使用基于分歧感知的集成技术，整合全局更新和本地知识来增强私有模型

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效降低全局模型性能，同时让攻击者获得显著优于全局模型的集成模型

Conclusion: 提出了自中心联邦学习攻击新范式，攻击者既能破坏系统又能获得竞争优势，揭示了联邦学习安全的新威胁

Abstract: In federated learning, participants' uploaded model updates cannot be
directly verified, leaving the system vulnerable to malicious attacks. Existing
attack strategies have adversaries upload tampered model updates to degrade the
global model's performance. However, attackers also degrade their own private
models, gaining no advantage. In real-world scenarios, attackers are driven by
self-centered motives: their goal is to gain a competitive advantage by
developing a model that outperforms those of other participants, not merely to
cause disruption. In this paper, we study a novel Self-Centered Federated
Learning (SCFL) attack paradigm, in which attackers not only degrade the
performance of the global model through attacks but also enhance their own
models within the federated learning process. We propose a framework named
FedThief, which degrades the performance of the global model by uploading
modified content during the upload stage. At the same time, it enhances the
private model's performance through divergence-aware ensemble techniques, where
"divergence" quantifies the deviation between private and global models, that
integrate global updates and local knowledge. Extensive experiments show that
our method effectively degrades the global model performance while allowing the
attacker to obtain an ensemble model that significantly outperforms the global
model.

TL;DR: 提出ASC方法整合财务和文本数据，通过优化权重参数和特征向量选择，在中小企业信用监测中实现比基线方法高18%的轮廓系数，并能识别有意义的聚类模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构数据（数值财务变量和文本记录）给信用监测带来重大挑战，需要开发能够有效整合多源数据的方法来提升监测效果。

Method: 提出高级谱聚类(ASC)方法，通过优化权重参数整合财务和文本相似度，采用新颖的特征值-轮廓优化方法选择特征向量。

Result: 在1,428家中小企业数据集上，ASC的轮廓系数比单类型数据基线方法高18%，识别出51%的低风险企业包含'社会招聘'术语，招聘导向企业违约风险低30%。

Conclusion: ASC成功将谱聚类理论与异构数据应用相结合，能够识别有意义的聚类模式，为更有针对性和有效的信用干预提供支持。

Abstract: Heterogeneous data, which encompass both numerical financial variables and
textual records, present substantial challenges for credit monitoring. To
address this issue, we propose Advanced Spectral Clustering (ASC), a method
that integrates financial and textual similarities through an optimized weight
parameter and selects eigenvectors using a novel eigenvalue-silhouette
optimization approach. Evaluated on a dataset comprising 1,428 small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), ASC achieves a Silhouette score that is 18%
higher than that of a single-type data baseline method. Furthermore, the
resulting clusters offer actionable insights; for instance, 51% of low-risk
firms are found to include the term 'social recruitment' in their textual
records. The robustness of ASC is confirmed across multiple clustering
algorithms, including k-means, k-medians, and k-medoids, with
{\Delta}Intra/Inter < 0.13 and {\Delta}Silhouette Coefficient < 0.02. By
bridging spectral clustering theory with heterogeneous data applications, ASC
enables the identification of meaningful clusters, such as recruitment-focused
SMEs exhibiting a 30% lower default risk, thereby supporting more targeted and
effective credit interventions.

Result: 在1,428家中国中小企业数据集上，IMST达到88.9%准确率，超越基准决策树(87.4%)以及逻辑回归、SVM等传统模型，具有更好的可解释性和计算效率。

Conclusion: IMST框架成功整合多源数据，显著提升信用评估性能，为中小企业风险评估提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional decision tree models, which rely exclusively on numerical
variables, often encounter difficulties in handling high-dimensional data and
fail to effectively incorporate textual information. To address these
limitations, we propose the Integrated Multivariate Segmentation Tree (IMST), a
comprehensive framework designed to enhance credit evaluation for small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by integrating financial data with textual
sources. The methodology comprises three core stages: (1) transforming textual
data into numerical matrices through matrix factorization; (2) selecting
salient financial features using Lasso regression; and (3) constructing a
multivariate segmentation tree based on the Gini index or Entropy, with
weakest-link pruning applied to regulate model complexity. Experimental results
derived from a dataset of 1,428 Chinese SMEs demonstrate that IMST achieves an
accuracy of 88.9%, surpassing baseline decision trees (87.4%) as well as
conventional models such as logistic regression and support vector machines
(SVM). Furthermore, the proposed model exhibits superior interpretability and
computational efficiency, featuring a more streamlined architecture and
enhanced risk detection capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备对模型压缩和推理速度有高要求，需要将GNN知识转移到更高效的模型。但MLP因固定激活函数和全连接结构无法有效捕捉GNN学习的复杂邻居依赖关系。

Method: 提出SA-DSD框架，改进Fourier KAN为FR-KAN+作为学生模型，包含可学习频率基和相位移机制。构建基于教师-学生预测一致性的边际级采样概率矩阵，设计自适应重加损失机制。

Result: 在6个实际数据集上，SA-DSD较三个GNN教师模型提升3.05%-3.62%性能，较FR-KAN+模型提升15.61%。参数数量减少16.96倍，推理时间减少55.75%。

Conclusion: SA-DSD框架通过从GNN向KAN的知识蓄粉，有效解决了边缘设备中模型压缩和性能的平衡问题，为资源约束环境下的深度学习模型部署提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is crucial for deploying deep learning models in
resource-constrained edge environments, particularly within the consumer
electronics sector, including smart home devices, wearable technology, and
mobile terminals. These applications place higher demands on model compression
and inference speed, necessitating the transfer of knowledge from Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to more efficient Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models. However,
due to their fixed activation functions and fully connected architecture, MLPs
face challenges in rapidly capturing the complex neighborhood dependencies
learned by GNNs, thereby limiting their performance in edge environments. To
address these limitations, this paper introduces an innovative from GNNs to
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) knowledge distillation framework-Self
Attention Dynamic Sampling Distillation (SA-DSD). This study improved Fourier
KAN (FR-KAN) and replaced MLP with the improved FR-KAN+ as the student model.
Through the incorporation of learnable frequency bases and phase-shift
mechanisms, along with algorithmic optimization, FR-KAN significantly improves
its nonlinear fitting capability while effectively reducing computational
complexity. Building on this, a margin-level sampling probability matrix, based
on teacher-student prediction consistency, is constructed, and an adaptive
weighted loss mechanism is designed to mitigate performance degradation in the
student model due to the lack of explicit neighborhood aggregation. Extensive
experiments conducted on six real-world datasets demonstrate that SA-DSD
achieves performance improvements of 3.05%-3.62% over three GNN teacher models
and 15.61% over the FR-KAN+ model. Moreover, when compared with key benchmark
models, SA-DSD achieves a 16.96x reduction in parameter count and a 55.75%
decrease in inference time.

Abstract: Quantifying transient causal interactions from non-stationary neural signals
is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Traditional methods are often
inadequate for brief neural events, and advanced, event-specific techniques
have lacked accessible implementations within the Python ecosystem. Here, we
introduce trancit (Transient Causal Interaction Toolbox), an open-source Python
package designed to bridge this gap. TranCIT implements a comprehensive
analysis pipeline, including Granger Causality, Transfer Entropy, and the more
robust Structural Causal Model-based Dynamic Causal Strength (DCS) and relative
Dynamic Causal Strength (rDCS) for accurately detecting event-driven causal
effects. We demonstrate TranCIT's utility by successfully capturing causality
in high-synchrony regimes where traditional methods fail and by identifying the
known transient information flow from hippocampal CA3 to CA1 during sharp-wave
ripple events in real-world data. The package offers a user-friendly, validated
solution for investigating the transient causal dynamics that govern complex
systems.

Abstract: In the era of foundation models, fine-tuning pre-trained models for specific
downstream tasks has become crucial. This drives the need for robust
fine-tuning methods to address challenges such as model overfitting and sparse
labeling. Molecular graph foundation models (MGFMs) face unique difficulties
that complicate fine-tuning. These models are limited by smaller pre-training
datasets and more severe data scarcity for downstream tasks, both of which
require enhanced model generalization. Moreover, MGFMs must accommodate diverse
objectives, including both regression and classification tasks. To better
understand and improve fine-tuning techniques under these conditions, we
classify eight fine-tuning methods into three mechanisms: weight-based,
representation-based, and partial fine-tuning. We benchmark these methods on
downstream regression and classification tasks across supervised and
self-supervised pre-trained models in diverse labeling settings. This extensive
evaluation provides valuable insights and informs the design of a refined
robust fine-tuning method, ROFT-MOL. This approach combines the strengths of
simple post-hoc weight interpolation with more complex weight ensemble
fine-tuning methods, delivering improved performance across both task types
while maintaining the ease of use inherent in post-hoc weight interpolation.

Abstract: The ionosphere critically influences Global Navigation Satellite Systems
(GNSS), satellite communications, and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) operations, yet
accurate prediction of its variability remains challenging due to nonlinear
couplings between solar, geomagnetic, and thermospheric drivers. Total Electron
Content (TEC), a key ionospheric parameter, is derived from GNSS observations,
but its reliable forecasting is limited by the sparse nature of global
measurements and the limited accuracy of empirical models, especially during
strong space weather conditions. In this work, we present a machine learning
framework for ionospheric TEC forecasting that leverages Temporal Fusion
Transformers (TFT) to predict sparse ionosphere data. Our approach accommodates
heterogeneous input sources, including solar irradiance, geomagnetic indices,
and GNSS-derived vertical TEC, and applies preprocessing and temporal alignment
strategies. Experiments spanning 2010-2025 demonstrate that the model achieves
robust predictions up to 24 hours ahead, with root mean square errors as low as
3.33 TECU. Results highlight that solar EUV irradiance provides the strongest
predictive signals. Beyond forecasting accuracy, the framework offers
interpretability through attention-based analysis, supporting both operational
applications and scientific discovery. To encourage reproducibility and
community-driven development, we release the full implementation as the
open-source toolkit \texttt{ionopy}.

### [496] [Disentangling Slow and Fast Temporal Dynamics in Degradation Inference with Hierarchical Differential Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00639)
*Mengjie Zhao,Olga Fink*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的层次控制微分方程框架（H-CDE），用于从传感器数据中推断系统退化，充分分离操作变化和缓慢退化过程。


<details>

Method: 提出H-CDE框架，包含缓慢（退化）和快速（操作）两个微分方程组件，采用多尺度时间积分、可学习路径变换和单调激活函数来解决数值稀疏性和退化分离问题。

Result: 在动态响应系统（如桥梁）和稳态系统（如航空发动机）上的综合评估显示，H-CDE能够有效分离退化和操作动态，性能超过基线残差方法，实现更准确、稳健和可解释的推断。

Conclusion: H-CDE框架为工程系统状态监测和预测保养提供了更有效的退化推断方法，通过充分分离不同时间尺度的系统动态，提高了健康评估和决策的准确性。

Abstract: Reliable inference of system degradation from sensor data is fundamental to
condition monitoring and prognostics in engineered systems. Since degradation
is rarely observable and measurable, it must be inferred to enable accurate
health assessment and decision-making. This is particularly challenging because
operational variations dominate system behavior, while degradation introduces
only subtle, long-term changes. Consequently, sensor data mainly reflect
short-term operational variability, making it difficult to disentangle the
underlying degradation process. Residual-based methods are widely employed, but
the residuals remain entangled with operational history, often resulting in
noisy and unreliable degradation estimation, particularly in systems with
dynamic responses. Neural Ordinary Equations (NODEs) offer a promising
framework for inferring latent dynamics, but the time-scale separation in
slow-fast systems introduces numerical stiffness and complicates training,
while degradation disentanglement remains difficult. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel Hierarchical Controlled Differential Equation
(H-CDE) framework that incorporates a slow (degradation) and a fast (operation)
CDE component in a unified architecture. It introduces three key innovations: a
multi-scale time integration scheme to mitigate numerical stiffness; a
learnable path transformation that extracts latent degradation drivers to
control degradation evolution; and a novel activation function that enforces
monotonicity on inferred degradation as a regularizer for disentanglement.
Through comprehensive evaluations on both dynamic response (e.g., bridges) and
steady state (e.g., aero-engine) systems, we demonstrate that H-CDE effectively
disentangles degradation from operational dynamics and outperforms
residual-based baselines, yielding more accurate, robust, and interpretable
inference.

Abstract: Generative models have achieved impressive results in text to image tasks,
significantly advancing visual content creation. However, this progress comes
at a cost, as such models rely heavily on large-scale training data and may
unintentionally replicate copyrighted elements, creating serious legal and
ethical challenges for real-world deployment. To address these concerns,
researchers have proposed various strategies to mitigate copyright risks, most
of which are prompt based methods that filter or rewrite user inputs to prevent
explicit infringement. While effective in handling obvious cases, these
approaches often fall short in more subtle situations, where seemingly benign
prompts can still lead to infringing outputs. To address these limitations,
this paper introduces Assessing and Mitigating Copyright Risks (AMCR), a
comprehensive framework which i) builds upon prompt-based strategies by
systematically restructuring risky prompts into safe and non-sensitive forms,
ii) detects partial infringements through attention-based similarity analysis,
and iii) adaptively mitigates risks during generation to reduce copyright
violations without compromising image quality. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of AMCR in revealing and mitigating latent copyright risks,
offering practical insights and benchmarks for the safer deployment of
generative models.

TL;DR: 提出CAEL-MIPS方法，通过学习上下文-动作嵌入来最小化MIPS估计器的均方误差，解决传统IPS方法在大动作空间或未充分探索区域方差大的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IPS方法在大动作空间或未充分探索的上下文-动作空间存在显著方差问题，现有MIPS方法使用的动作嵌入未能最小化MSE且未考虑上下文信息

Method: 提出CAEL-MIPS方法，从离线数据学习上下文-动作嵌入，基于MIPS的偏差和方差理论分析，构建MSE最小化目标函数

Result: 在合成数据集和真实数据集上的实证研究表明，该方法在MSE指标上优于基线方法

Conclusion: CAEL-MIPS通过联合学习上下文-动作嵌入有效降低了MIPS估计器的MSE，为OPE问题提供了更准确的评估方法

Abstract: We consider off-policy evaluation (OPE) in contextual bandits with finite
action space. Inverse Propensity Score (IPS) weighting is a widely used method
for OPE due to its unbiased, but it suffers from significant variance when the
action space is large or when some parts of the context-action space are
underexplored. Recently introduced Marginalized IPS (MIPS) estimators mitigate
this issue by leveraging action embeddings. However, these embeddings do not
minimize the mean squared error (MSE) of the estimators and do not consider
context information. To address these limitations, we introduce Context-Action
Embedding Learning for MIPS, or CAEL-MIPS, which learns context-action
embeddings from offline data to minimize the MSE of the MIPS estimator.
Building on the theoretical analysis of bias and variance of MIPS, we present
an MSE-minimizing objective for CAEL-MIPS. In the empirical studies on a
synthetic dataset and a real-world dataset, we demonstrate that our estimator
outperforms baselines in terms of MSE.

Abstract: When working with tabular data, missingness is always one of the most painful
problems. Throughout many years, researchers have continuously explored better
and better ways to impute missing data. Recently, with the rapid development
evolution in machine learning and deep learning, there is a new trend of
leveraging generative models to solve the imputation task. While the imputing
version of famous models such as Variational Autoencoders or Generative
Adversarial Networks were investigated, prior work has overlooked Neural
Cellular Automata (NCA), a powerful computational model. In this paper, we
propose a novel imputation method that is inspired by NCA. We show that, with
some appropriate adaptations, an NCA-based model is able to address the missing
data imputation problem. We also provide several experiments to evidence that
our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of imputation error and
post-imputation performance.

Abstract: Regional weather forecasting is a critical problem for localized climate
adaptation, disaster mitigation, and sustainable development. While machine
learning has shown impressive progress in global weather forecasting, regional
forecasting remains comparatively underexplored. Existing efforts often use
different datasets and experimental setups, limiting fair comparison and
reproducibility. We introduce IndiaWeatherBench, a comprehensive benchmark for
data-driven regional weather forecasting focused on the Indian subcontinent.
IndiaWeatherBench provides a curated dataset built from high-resolution
regional reanalysis products, along with a suite of deterministic and
probabilistic metrics to facilitate consistent training and evaluation. To
establish strong baselines, we implement and evaluate a range of models across
diverse architectures, including UNets, Transformers, and Graph-based networks,
as well as different boundary conditioning strategies and training objectives.
While focused on India, IndiaWeatherBench is easily extensible to other
geographic regions. We open-source all raw and preprocessed datasets, model
implementations, and evaluation pipelines to promote accessibility and future
development. We hope IndiaWeatherBench will serve as a foundation for advancing
regional weather forecasting research. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有物理信息神经网络和算子学习方法（如DeepONet、FNO）在平衡算子损失和物理损失、处理噪声稀疏数据、提供不确定性量化方面存在困难

Method: 整合进化多目标优化自适应平衡损失、副本交换随机梯度Langevin动力学改善参数空间探索、内置贝叶斯不确定性量化

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了现有算子学习方法的局限性，为参数偏微分方程求解提供了更有效的解决方案

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization for
Replica-Exchange-based Physics-informed Operator learning Network, which is a
novel operator learning network to efficiently solve parametric partial
differential equations. In forward and inverse settings, this operator learning
network only admits minimum requirement of noisy observational data. While
physics-informed neural networks and operator learning approaches such as Deep
Operator Networks and Fourier Neural Operators offer promising alternatives to
traditional numerical solvers, they struggle with balancing operator and
physics losses, maintaining robustness under noisy or sparse data, and
providing uncertainty quantification. The proposed framework addresses these
limitations by integrating: (i) evolutionary multi-objective optimization to
adaptively balance operator and physics-based losses in the Pareto front; (ii)
replica exchange stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics to improve global
parameter-space exploration and accelerate convergence; and (iii) built-in
Bayesian uncertainty quantification from stochastic sampling. The proposed
operator learning method is tested numerically on several different problems
including one-dimensional Burgers equation and the time-fractional mixed
diffusion-wave equation. The results indicate that our framework consistently
outperforms the general operator learning methods in accuracy, noise
robustness, and the ability to quantify uncertainty.

Motivation: 在药物发现中，特别是在低数据条件下，如何有效引导生成模型探索药理学相关的化学空间仍然是一个主要挑战。

Method: VECTOR+结合了属性引导的表征学习和可控分子生成，适用于回归和分类任务，通过对比学习实现数据高效的功能性化学空间探索。

Result: 在PD-L1抑制剂数据集上，生成的8374个分子中有100个超过对接阈值-15.0 kcal/mol，最佳得分-17.6 kcal/mol优于参考抑制剂(-15.4 kcal/mol)。分子动力学模拟证实结合稳定性。在激酶抑制剂上也表现出优于现有药物的性能。

Conclusion: VECTOR+为低数据条件下的属性条件分子设计提供了一个稳健、可扩展的方法，成功桥接了对比学习和生成建模，实现了可重复的AI加速药物发现。

Abstract: Efficiently steering generative models toward pharmacologically relevant
regions of chemical space remains a major obstacle in molecular drug discovery
under low-data regimes. We present VECTOR+: Valid-property-Enhanced Contrastive
Learning for Targeted Optimization and Resampling, a framework that couples
property-guided representation learning with controllable molecule generation.
VECTOR+ applies to both regression and classification tasks and enables
interpretable, data-efficient exploration of functional chemical space. We
evaluate on two datasets: a curated PD-L1 inhibitor set (296 compounds with
experimental $IC_{50}$ values) and a receptor kinase inhibitor set (2,056
molecules by binding mode). Despite limited training data, VECTOR+ generates
novel, synthetically tractable candidates. Against PD-L1 (PDB 5J89), 100 of
8,374 generated molecules surpass a docking threshold of $-15.0$ kcal/mol, with
the best scoring $-17.6$ kcal/mol compared to the top reference inhibitor
($-15.4$ kcal/mol). The best-performing molecules retain the conserved biphenyl
pharmacophore while introducing novel motifs. Molecular dynamics (250 ns)
confirm binding stability (ligand RMSD < $2.5$ angstroms). VECTOR+ generalizes
to kinase inhibitors, producing compounds with stronger docking scores than
established drugs such as brigatinib and sorafenib. Benchmarking against JT-VAE
and MolGPT across docking, novelty, uniqueness, and Tanimoto similarity
highlights the superior performance of our method. These results position our
work as a robust, extensible approach for property-conditioned molecular design
in low-data settings, bridging contrastive learning and generative modeling for
reproducible, AI-accelerated discovery.

TL;DR: 提出DELTA框架解决隐私保护数据重编程问题，通过两阶段变分解耦生成学习，在提升目标属性预测精度的同时降低敏感属性预测精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中数据常包含敏感属性且受严格监管，现有特征工程主要关注下游任务性能而忽视隐私泄露风险，需要新的隐私保护特征转换方法

Method: 两阶段变分解耦生成学习框架：第一阶段使用策略引导强化学习发现具有下游任务效用的特征转换；第二阶段使用变分LSTM seq2seq编码器-解码器，结合效用-隐私解耦潜在空间设计和对抗-因果解耦正则化

Result: 在8个数据集上实验显示，DELTA将预测性能提升约9.3%，隐私泄露减少约35%

Conclusion: DELTA框架能够实现稳健的隐私感知数据转换，有效平衡效用和隐私保护需求

Abstract: In real-world applications, domain data often contains identifiable or
sensitive attributes, is subject to strict regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR), and
requires explicit data feature engineering for interpretability and
transparency. Existing feature engineering primarily focuses on advancing
downstream task performance, often risking privacy leakage. We generalize this
learning task under such new requirements as Privacy-Preserving Data
Reprogramming (PPDR): given a dataset, transforming features to maximize target
attribute prediction accuracy while minimizing sensitive attribute prediction
accuracy. PPDR poses challenges for existing systems: 1) generating
high-utility feature transformations without being overwhelmed by a large
search space, and 2) disentangling and eliminating sensitive information from
utility-oriented features to reduce privacy inferability. To tackle these
challenges, we propose DELTA, a two-phase variational disentangled generative
learning framework. Phase I uses policy-guided reinforcement learning to
discover feature transformations with downstream task utility, without any
regard to privacy inferability. Phase II employs a variational LSTM seq2seq
encoder-decoder with a utility-privacy disentangled latent space design and
adversarial-causal disentanglement regularization to suppress privacy signals
during feature generation. Experiments on eight datasets show DELTA improves
predictive performance by ~9.3% and reduces privacy leakage by ~35%,
demonstrating robust, privacy-aware data transformation.

Motivation: 传统图神经网络在时空预测中存在频谱纠缠问题，而分解集成方法如VMGCN虽然提高精度但计算效率低且需要手动调参

Method: 开发可展开的VMD模块替代迭代优化，采用模式特定的可学习带宽约束自适应空间异质性并消除手动调参

Result: 在LargeST基准测试中，分解时间减少250倍，预测误差比VMGCN降低85-95%，优于最先进基线方法

Conclusion: MAGN通过将传统信号处理技术转化为可训练神经网络模块，有效解决了时空预测中的计算效率和精度问题

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal forecasting is critical for numerous complex systems
but remains challenging due to complex volatility patterns and spectral
entanglement in conventional graph neural networks (GNNs). While
decomposition-integrated approaches like variational mode graph convolutional
network (VMGCN) improve accuracy through signal decomposition, they suffer from
computational inefficiency and manual hyperparameter tuning. To address these
limitations, we propose the mode adaptive graph network (MAGN) that transforms
iterative variational mode decomposition (VMD) into a trainable neural module.
Our key innovations include (1) an unfolded VMD (UVMD) module that replaces
iterative optimization with a fixed-depth network to reduce the decomposition
time (by 250x for the LargeST benchmark), and (2) mode-specific learnable
bandwidth constraints ({\alpha}k ) adapt spatial heterogeneity and eliminate
manual tuning while preventing spectral overlap. Evaluated on the LargeST
benchmark (6,902 sensors, 241M observations), MAGN achieves an 85-95% reduction
in the prediction error over VMGCN and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 池式主动学习的可扩展性受到评估大规模未标记数据集计算成本的限制，这在药物发现的虚拟筛选中尤为突出。虽然BALD等策略优先选择信息量大的样本，但在处理包含数十亿样本的库时仍然计算密集。

Method: 利用生成流网络(GFlowNets)直接按照BALD奖励比例采样对象，用生成式采样替代传统的池式获取方法，使可扩展性与未标记池的大小无关。

Result: 在虚拟筛选实验中，BALD-GFlowNet实现了与标准BALD基线相当的性能，同时生成了结构更多样化的分子。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效且可扩展的分子发现提供了一个有前景的方向，解决了大规模主动学习的计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: The scalability of pool-based active learning is limited by the computational
cost of evaluating large unlabeled datasets, a challenge that is particularly
acute in virtual screening for drug discovery. While active learning strategies
such as Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD) prioritize informative
samples, it remains computationally intensive when scaled to libraries
containing billions samples. In this work, we introduce BALD-GFlowNet, a
generative active learning framework that circumvents this issue. Our method
leverages Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to directly sample objects in
proportion to the BALD reward. By replacing traditional pool-based acquisition
with generative sampling, BALD-GFlowNet achieves scalability that is
independent of the size of the unlabeled pool. In our virtual screening
experiment, we show that BALD-GFlowNet achieves a performance comparable to
that of standard BALD baseline while generating more structurally diverse
molecules, offering a promising direction for efficient and scalable molecular
discovery.

Motivation: 当前持续图学习方法面临两个主要问题：1)重放方法在稳定性-可塑性困境中存在不平衡且存储成本高；2)无重放方法严重依赖资源密集型预训练骨干网络。本文认为关键在于动态调制冻结骨干网络的内部计算流。

Method: 提出任务感知自适应调制(TAAM)方法，使用神经突触调制器(NSM)来存储专家知识。采用原型引导策略：训练时从相似过去调制器深度复制初始化新NSM以促进知识迁移；推理时为每个任务选择最相关的冻结NSM。

Conclusion: TAAM通过轻量级任务特定模块有效引导GNN的推理过程，为导航稳定性-可塑性困境开辟了新途径，是一种无需重放、资源高效的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Continual Graph Learning(CGL)focuses on acquiring new knowledge while
retaining previously learned information, essential for real-world graph
applications. Current methods grapple with two main issues:1) The
Stability-Plasticity Dilemma: Replay-based methods often create an imbalance
between the Dilemma, while incurring significant storage costs.2) The
Resource-Heavy Pre-training: Leading replay-free methods critically depend on
extensively pre-trained backbones, this reliance imposes a substantial resource
burden.In this paper, we argue that the key to overcoming these challenges lies
not in replaying data or fine-tuning the entire network, but in dynamically
modulating the internal computational flow of a frozen backbone. We posit that
lightweight, task-specific modules can effectively steer a GNN's reasoning
process. Motivated by this insight, we propose Task-Aware Adaptive
Modulation(TAAM), a replay-free, resource-efficient approach that charts a new
path for navigating the stability-plasticity dilemma. TAAM's core is its Neural
Synapse Modulators(NSM), which are trained and then frozen for each task to
store expert knowledge. A pivotal prototype-guided strategy governs these
modulators: 1) For training, it initializes a new NSM by deep-copying from a
similar past modulator to boost knowledge transfer. 2) For inference, it
selects the most relevant frozen NSM for each task. These NSMs insert into a
frozen GNN backbone to perform fine-grained, node-attentive modulation of its
internal flow-different from the static perturbations of prior methods.
Extensive experiments show that TAAM comprehensively outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across six GCIL benchmark datasets. The code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了传统DST分类器的局限性，提供了更丰富灵活的不确定信息表示，显著提升了分类性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) provides a powerful framework for modeling
uncertainty and has been widely applied to multi-attribute classification
tasks. However, traditional DST-based attribute fusion-based classifiers suffer
from oversimplified membership function modeling and limited exploitation of
the belief structure brought by basic probability assignment (BPA), reducing
their effectiveness in complex real-world scenarios. This paper presents an
enhanced attribute fusion-based classifier that addresses these limitations
through two key innovations. First, we adopt a selective modeling strategy that
utilizes both single Gaussian and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for membership
function construction, with model selection guided by cross-validation and a
tailored evaluation metric. Second, we introduce a novel method to transform
the possibility distribution into a BPA by combining simple BPAs derived from
normalized possibility distributions, enabling a much richer and more flexible
representation of uncertain information. Furthermore, we apply the belief
structure-based BPA generation method to the evidential K-Nearest Neighbors
classifier, enhancing its ability to incorporate uncertainty information into
decision-making. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted
to evaluate the performance of the proposed attribute fusion-based classifier
and the enhanced evidential K-Nearest Neighbors classifier in comparison with
both evidential classifiers and conventional machine learning classifiers. The
results demonstrate that our proposed classifier outperforms the best existing
evidential classifier, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 4.84%,
while maintaining low variance, thus confirming its superior effectiveness and
robustness.

Result: 在五个基准异质数据集上的实验表明，Poly模型始终优于现有基线，Dir-Poly在具有固有方向性的图上（如Roman Empire）提供额外增益，达到最先进结果。在无向图上引入人工方向性并不总是有帮助。

Conclusion: 研究发现边方向和表达能力强的特征建模在异质图学习中具有互补作用，方向性消息传递的益处是情境依赖的。

Abstract: In heterophilic graphs, where neighboring nodes often belong to different
classes, conventional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) struggle due to their
reliance on local homophilous neighborhoods. Prior studies suggest that
modeling edge directionality in such graphs can increase effective homophily
and improve classification performance. Simultaneously, recent work on
polynomially expressive GNNs shows promise in capturing higher-order
interactions among features. In this work, we study the combined effect of edge
directionality and expressive message passing on node classification in
heterophilic graphs. Specifically, we propose two architectures: (1) a
polynomially expressive GAT baseline (Poly), and (2) a direction-aware variant
(Dir-Poly) that separately aggregates incoming and outgoing edges. Both models
are designed to learn permutation-equivariant high-degree polynomials over
input features, while remaining scalable with no added time complexity.
Experiments on five benchmark heterophilic datasets show that our Poly model
consistently outperforms existing baselines, and that Dir-Poly offers
additional gains on graphs with inherent directionality (e.g., Roman Empire),
achieving state-of-the-art results. Interestingly, on undirected graphs,
introducing artificial directionality does not always help, suggesting that the
benefit of directional message passing is context-dependent. Our findings
highlight the complementary roles of edge direction and expressive feature
modeling in heterophilic graph learning.

### [509] [ProCause: Generating Counterfactual Outcomes to Evaluate Prescriptive Process Monitoring Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00797)
*Jakob De Moor,Hans Weytjens,Johannes De Smedt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ProCause方法，通过集成多种因果推理架构和时序模型来改进Prescriptive Process Monitoring的评估效果，解决了现有RealCause方法忽略时序依赖性和架构单一的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RealCause方法在评估PresPM时存在两个主要缺陷：忽略了流程数据中的时序依赖性，以及仅依赖单一的TARNet因果推理架构，限制了评估效果。

Method: 开发了ProCause生成方法，支持序列模型（如LSTM）和非序列模型，并集成多种因果推理架构（S-Learner、T-Learner、TARNet和集成模型）。

Result: 研究表明TARNet并非总是最佳选择，模型集成提供更一致的可靠性，LSTM在存在时序依赖时能显著改善评估效果。通过真实数据分析验证了ProCause的实用性。

Conclusion: ProCause通过多架构集成和时序建模，为PresPM方法提供了更可靠的评估框架，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) is the subfield of Process Mining
that focuses on optimizing processes through real-time interventions based on
event log data. Evaluating PresPM methods is challenging due to the lack of
ground-truth outcomes for all intervention actions in datasets. A generative
deep learning approach from the field of Causal Inference (CI), RealCause, has
been commonly used to estimate the outcomes for proposed intervention actions
to evaluate a new policy. However, RealCause overlooks the temporal
dependencies in process data, and relies on a single CI model architecture,
TARNet, limiting its effectiveness. To address both shortcomings, we introduce
ProCause, a generative approach that supports both sequential (e.g., LSTMs) and
non-sequential models while integrating multiple CI architectures (S-Learner,
T-Learner, TARNet, and an ensemble). Our research using a simulator with known
ground truths reveals that TARNet is not always the best choice; instead, an
ensemble of models offers more consistent reliability, and leveraging LSTMs
shows potential for improved evaluations when temporal dependencies are
present. We further validate ProCause's practical effectiveness through a
real-world data analysis, ensuring a more reliable evaluation of PresPM
methods.

Abstract: At the intersection of the cutting-edge technologies and privacy concerns,
Federated Learning (FL) with its distributed architecture, stands at the
forefront in a bid to facilitate collaborative model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy. However, the applicability of FL systems
is hindered by fairness concerns arising from numerous sources of heterogeneity
that can result in biases and undermine a system's effectiveness, with skewed
predictions, reduced accuracy, and inefficient model convergence. This survey
thus explores the diverse sources of bias, including but not limited to, data,
client, and model biases, and thoroughly discusses the strengths and
limitations inherited within the array of the state-of-the-art techniques
utilized in the literature to mitigate such disparities in the FL training
process. We delineate a comprehensive overview of the several notions,
theoretical underpinnings, and technical aspects associated with fairness and
their adoption in FL-based multidisciplinary environments. Furthermore, we
examine salient evaluation metrics leveraged to measure fairness
quantitatively. Finally, we envisage exciting open research directions that
have the potential to drive future advancements in achieving fairer FL
frameworks, in turn, offering a strong foundation for future research in this
pivotal area.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in the automotive industry
for applications such as driving style classification, which aims to improve
road safety, efficiency, and personalize user experiences. While deep learning
(DL) models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, excel at this
task, their black-box nature limits interpretability and trust. This paper
proposes a machine learning (ML)-based method that balances high accuracy with
interpretability. We introduce a high-quality dataset, CARLA-Drive, and
leverage ML techniques like Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (XGBoost),
and Support Vector Machine (SVM), which are efficient, lightweight, and
interpretable. In addition, we apply the SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)
explainability technique to provide personalized recommendations for safer
driving. Achieving an accuracy of 0.92 on a three-class classification task
with both RF and XGBoost classifiers, our approach matches DL models in
performance while offering transparency and practicality for real-world
deployment in intelligent transportation systems.

Motivation: 解决有机材料晶体结构预测的挑战，现有方法依赖计算昂贵的迭代流匹配方法，需要更高效准确的解决方案。

Method: 提出新颖的损失函数，通过基于Sinkhorn算法的可微分线性分配方案来捕捉关键几何分子特性，同时保持对分子集合的置换不变性。

Conclusion: SinkFast方法为分子组装和晶体结构预测提供了一种更高效准确的解决方案，展示了简单回归方法在适当损失函数设计下的优越性能。

Abstract: Crystalline structure prediction remains an open challenge in materials
design. Despite recent advances in computational materials science, accurately
predicting the three-dimensional crystal structures of organic materials--an
essential first step for designing materials with targeted properties--remains
elusive. In this work, we address the problem of molecular assembly, where a
set $\mathcal{S}$ of identical rigid molecules is packed to form a crystalline
structure. Existing state-of-the-art models typically rely on computationally
expensive, iterative flow-matching approaches. We propose a novel loss function
that correctly captures key geometric molecular properties while maintaining
permutation invariance over $\mathcal{S}$. We achieve this via a differentiable
linear assignment scheme based on the Sinkhorn algorithm. Remarkably, we show
that even a simple regression using our method {\em SinkFast} significantly
outperforms more complex flow-matching approaches on the COD-Cluster17
benchmark, a curated subset of the Crystallography Open Database (COD).

Motivation: 机器学习在医疗等高风险领域部署时，需要可解释性。传统SHAP方法无法区分因果关系和相关关系，在特征高度相关时会产生误导性的特征重要性归因

Method: 结合Peter-Clark(PC)算法进行因果发现和IDA算法进行因果强度量化，开发了Causal SHAP框架，在保持SHAP优良特性的同时整合因果关系

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验验证表明，Causal SHAP能够降低仅与目标相关的特征归因分数，提供更准确的因果感知解释

Conclusion: 该研究为可解释AI领域提供了实用的因果感知模型解释框架，特别在医疗等需要理解真实因果关系的领域具有重要价值

Abstract: Explaining machine learning (ML) predictions has become crucial as ML models
are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. While
SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is widely used for model interpretability,
it fails to differentiate between causality and correlation, often
misattributing feature importance when features are highly correlated. We
propose Causal SHAP, a novel framework that integrates causal relationships
into feature attribution while preserving many desirable properties of SHAP. By
combining the Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm for causal discovery and the
Intervention Calculus when the DAG is Absent (IDA) algorithm for causal
strength quantification, our approach addresses the weakness of SHAP.
Specifically, Causal SHAP reduces attribution scores for features that are
merely correlated with the target, as validated through experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets. This study contributes to the field of
Explainable AI (XAI) by providing a practical framework for causal-aware model
explanations. Our approach is particularly valuable in domains such as
healthcare, where understanding true causal relationships is critical for
informed decision-making.

Motivation: 传统天赋识别方法依赖人工流程、过于关注学术成绩，且通常在高等教育阶段才进行干预，忽视了非学术天赋和早期干预机会。

Method: 使用半监督多模态神经网络（Transformer+LSTM+ANN），基于1,041名中学生的离线教育数据，将各类获奖记录聚类为天赋类别，并从学习行为中提取特征。

Result: 模型取得了0.908的分类准确率和0.908的ROCAUC值，表现出色。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能够早期识别学生的多样化天赋，为天赋识别提供了新的技术途径。

Abstract: Talent identification plays a critical role in promoting student development.
However, traditional approaches often rely on manual processes or focus
narrowly on academic achievement, and typically delaying intervention until the
higher education stage. This oversight overlooks diverse non-academic talents
and misses opportunities for early intervention. To address this gap, this
study introduces TalentPredictor, a novel semi-supervised multi-modal neural
network that combines Transformer, LSTM, and ANN architectures. This model is
designed to predict seven different talent types--academic, sport, art,
leadership, service, technology, and others--in secondary school students
within an offline educational setting. Drawing on existing offline educational
data from 1,041 local secondary students, TalentPredictor overcomes the
limitations of traditional talent identification methods. By clustering various
award records into talent categories and extracting features from students'
diverse learning behaviors, it achieves high prediction accuracy (0.908
classification accuracy, 0.908 ROCAUC). This demonstrates the potential of
machine learning to identify diverse talents early in student development.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations methods provide an important tool in the field of
{interpretable machine learning}. Recent advances in this direction have
focused on diffusion models to explain a deep classifier. However, these
techniques have predominantly focused on problems in computer vision. In this
paper, we focus on tabular data typical in finance and the social sciences and
propose a novel guided reverse process for categorical features based on an
approximation to the Gumbel-softmax distribution. Furthermore, we study the
effect of the temperature $\tau$ and derive a theoretical bound between the
Gumbel-softmax distribution and our proposed approximated distribution. We
perform experiments on several large-scale credit lending and other tabular
datasets, assessing their performance in terms of the quantitative measures of
interpretability, diversity, instability, and validity. These results indicate
that our approach outperforms popular baseline methods, producing robust and
realistic counterfactual explanations.

Abstract: Explainable machine learning has attracted much interest in the community
where the stakes are high. Counterfactual explanations methods have become an
important tool in explaining a black-box model. The recent advances have
leveraged the power of generative models such as an autoencoder. In this paper,
we propose a novel method using a Gaussian process to construct the
auto-encoder architecture for generating counterfactual samples. The resulting
model requires fewer learnable parameters and thus is less prone to
overfitting. We also introduce a novel density estimator that allows for
searching for in-distribution samples. Furthermore, we introduce an algorithm
for selecting the optimal regularization rate on density estimator while
searching for counterfactuals. We experiment with our method in several
large-scale tabular datasets and compare with other auto-encoder-based methods.
The results show that our method is capable of generating diversified and
in-distribution counterfactual samples.

TL;DR: DTRNet是一种改进的Transformer架构，通过动态令牌路由机制，让大多数令牌跳过二次复杂度的注意力计算，只进行线性更新，从而显著降低计算成本同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer对每个令牌在每个层都应用二次复杂度的自注意力计算，计算成本高昂。需要一种方法在保持性能的同时显著降低计算复杂度。

Method: 提出动态令牌路由网络(DTRNet)，保留MLP模块，但让大多数令牌跳过注意力计算，只对约10%的令牌进行完整的注意力计算，其余令牌进行轻量级线性更新。

Result: DTRNet在保持与完整Transformer相当性能的同时，将计算FLOPs显著降低，特别是在长序列输入时效率提升明显，在相同FLOPs下比MoD和D-LLM等路由方法表现更好。

Conclusion: DTRNet通过解耦令牌更新和注意力混合，大幅降低了二次计算的比例，为Transformer提供了一个简单、高效且可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Transformers achieve state-of-the-art results across many tasks, but their
uniform application of quadratic self-attention to every token at every layer
makes them computationally expensive. We introduce DTRNet (Dynamic Token
Routing Network), an improved Transformer architecture that allows tokens to
dynamically skip the quadratic cost of cross-token mixing while still receiving
lightweight linear updates. By preserving the MLP module and reducing the
attention cost for most tokens to linear, DTRNet ensures that every token is
explicitly updated while significantly lowering overall computation. This
design offers an efficient and effective alternative to standard dense
attention. Once trained, DTRNet blocks routes only ~10% of tokens through
attention at each layer while maintaining performance comparable to a full
Transformer. It consistently outperforms routing-based layer skipping methods
such as MoD and D-LLM in both accuracy and memory at matched FLOPs, while
routing fewer tokens to full attention. Its efficiency gains, scales with
sequence length, offering significant reduction in FLOPs for long-context
inputs. By decoupling token updates from attention mixing, DTRNet substantially
reduces the quadratic share of computation, providing a simple, efficient, and
scalable alternative to Transformers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络难以解释，因为消息传递混合了信号且内部通道很少与人类概念对齐，需要研究GNN潜在空间中的特征叠加现象来改善可解释性。

Method: 使用具有明确图概念的受控实验，在图形级别提取类条件质心特征，在节点级别提取线性探测方向特征，并通过基础不变诊断分析其几何结构。

Result: 发现增加宽度会产生重叠的相位模式；拓扑将重叠印记到节点级特征中；更锐利的池化增加轴对齐并减少通道共享；浅层模型可能陷入亚稳态低秩嵌入。

Conclusion: 这些结果将表示几何与具体设计选择(宽度、池化和最终层激活)联系起来，并为构建更可解释的GNN提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Interpreting graph neural networks (GNNs) is difficult because message
passing mixes signals and internal channels rarely align with human concepts.
We study superposition, the sharing of directions by multiple features,
directly in the latent space of GNNs. Using controlled experiments with
unambiguous graph concepts, we extract features as (i) class-conditional
centroids at the graph level and (ii) linear-probe directions at the node
level, and then analyze their geometry with simple basis-invariant diagnostics.
Across GCN/GIN/GAT we find: increasing width produces a phase pattern in
overlap; topology imprints overlap onto node-level features that pooling
partially remixes into task-aligned graph axes; sharper pooling increases axis
alignment and reduces channel sharing; and shallow models can settle into
metastable low-rank embeddings. These results connect representational geometry
with concrete design choices (width, pooling, and final-layer activations) and
suggest practical approaches for more interpretable GNNs.

TL;DR: SCOUT是一种混合架构，通过分段压缩和稀疏注意力机制，在保持Transformer表达能力的同时显著降低计算和内存成本，在长序列任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer的二次注意力复杂度限制了长序列的可扩展性，而线性模型虽然效率高但可能因无法保留远距离令牌的详细信息而导致性能下降。

Method: 提出SCOUT架构：首先使用线性局部混合器（Mamba或SWA）丰富令牌嵌入，然后让每个令牌稀疏地关注少量压缩的检查点令牌来总结输入历史，而不是关注所有先前令牌。

Result: 在相同计算预算下，SCOUT在长上下文语言建模和推理任务中优于强基线，在4亿和13亿参数规模上匹配全注意力Transformer的语言建模和常识推理性能，同时实现更高的端到端吞吐量。

Conclusion: SCOUT通过局部压缩和稀疏注意力机制，在保持性能的同时实现了计算和内存效率的显著提升，为长序列处理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of
sequence modeling tasks, but their quadratic attention complexity limits
scalability to long sequences. Linear models such as Mamba and sliding-window
attention (SWA) address this by mixing tokens through recurrent or localized
operations with fixed-size memory, achieving efficient inference. However,
these methods risk degrading performance on long sequences due to their
inability to retain detailed information from distant tokens. We propose SCOUT
(Segment Compression for Optimized Utility in Transformers), a hybrid
architecture that compresses tokens locally within fixed-size segments and
applies attention only over these compressed representations. Each token
embedding is first enriched via a linear local mixer, Mamba or SWA, that
integrates recent context. Then, instead of attending to all previous tokens,
each token sparsely attends to a small number of compressed checkpoint tokens
that summarize the input history. This design retains much of the expressivity
of full attention while substantially reducing the computational and memory
cost. By attending to compressed history rather than all previous tokens, SCOUT
incurs slightly higher memory than purely linear models, but its growth rate
remains sub-quadratic and far more scalable than that of full Transformers. We
analyze SCOUT's computational and memory efficiency and evaluate it empirically
on long-context language modeling and reasoning tasks. SCOUT with both Mamba
and SWA mixers outperforms strong long-sequence baselines under the same
computational budget, matches full-attention Transformers on language modeling
and common-sense reasoning tasks at 400M and 1.3B scales. Moreover, our SCOUT
achieves higher end-to-end throughput than SOTA models, while delivering
comparable results on long sequence benchmarks.

TL;DR: ART是一种自适应重采样训练方法，通过基于类别性能动态调整训练数据分布，在类别不平衡分类任务中显著优于传统静态重采样方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统重采样方法使用固定分布（欠采样多数类或过采样少数类），忽略了类别学习难度的动态变化，限制了模型整体性能

Method: 提出自适应重采样训练(ART)方法，定期基于模型的类别级macro F1分数更新训练数据分布，在类别级别而非实例级别进行自适应调整

Result: 在多个基准测试中（包括Pima Indians Diabetes和Yeast数据集），ART始终优于基于重采样和算法级别的方法，平均提高macro F1分数2.64个百分点，统计显著性p<0.05

Conclusion: ART通过类别级别的自适应重采样，能够可靠地提供最强的macro F1性能，是不平衡分类任务的可靠选择

Abstract: Traditional resampling methods for handling class imbalance typically uses
fixed distributions, undersampling the majority or oversampling the minority.
These static strategies ignore changes in class-wise learning difficulty, which
can limit the overall performance of the model.
  This paper proposes an Adaptive Resampling-based Training (ART) method that
periodically updates the distribution of the training data based on the
class-wise performance of the model. Specifically, ART uses class-wise macro F1
scores, computed at fixed intervals, to determine the degree of resampling to
be performed.
  Unlike instance-level difficulty modeling, which is noisy and
outlier-sensitive, ART adapts at the class level. This allows the model to
incrementally shift its attention towards underperforming classes in a way that
better aligns with the optimization objective.
  Results on diverse benchmarks, including Pima Indians Diabetes and Yeast
dataset demonstrate that ART consistently outperforms both resampling-based and
algorithm-level methods, including Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique
(SMOTE), NearMiss Undersampling, and Cost-sensitive Learning on binary as well
as multi-class classification tasks with varying degrees of imbalance.
  In most settings, these improvements are statistically significant. On
tabular datasets, gains are significant under paired t-tests and Wilcoxon tests
(p < 0.05), while results on text and image tasks remain favorable. Compared to
training on the original imbalanced data, ART improves macro F1 by an average
of 2.64 percentage points across all tested tabular datasets. Unlike existing
methods, whose performance varies by task, ART consistently delivers the
strongest macro F1, making it a reliable choice for imbalanced classification.

Abstract: Multi-task learning is an effective way to address the challenge of model
personalization caused by high data heterogeneity in federated learning.
However, extending multi-task learning to the online decentralized federated
learning setting is yet to be explored. The online decentralized federated
learning setting considers many real-world applications of federated learning,
such as autonomous systems, where clients communicate peer-to-peer and the data
distribution of each client is time-varying. A more serious problem in
real-world applications of federated learning is the presence of Byzantine
clients. Byzantine-resilient approaches used in federated learning work only
when the number of Byzantine clients is less than one-half the total number of
clients. Yet, it is difficult to put a limit on the number of Byzantine clients
within a system in reality. However, recent work in robotics shows that it is
possible to exploit cyber-physical properties of a system to predict clients'
behavior and assign a trust probability to received signals. This can help to
achieve resiliency in the presence of a dominating number of Byzantine clients.
Therefore, in this paper, we develop an online decentralized federated
multi-task learning algorithm to provide model personalization and resiliency
when the number of Byzantine clients dominates the number of honest clients.
Our proposed algorithm leverages cyber-physical properties, such as the
received signal strength in wireless systems or side information, to assign a
trust probability to local models received from neighbors in each iteration.
Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs close to a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微调方法参数空间僵化，无法动态激活适当的神经通路来灵活适应多样化和演化的数据分布。

Method: 利用混合专家架构集成多个提示专家，自适应学习不同数据分布，作为有效的流形映射框架。

Result: 在SuperGLUE上优于多个最先进的参数高效基线方法，平均准确率提升1.94%，同时显著减少激活提示79.25%。

Conclusion: MEPT是一个有效且高效的流形映射框架，通过理论分析和神经激活通路可视化结果验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Considering deep neural networks as manifold mappers, the
pretrain-then-fine-tune paradigm can be interpreted as a two-stage process:
pretrain establishes a broad knowledge base, and fine-tune adjusts the model
parameters to activate specific neural pathways to align with the target
manifold. Although prior fine-tuning approaches demonstrate success, their
rigid parameter space limits their ability to dynamically activate appropriate
neural pathways, rendering them ill-equipped to adapt flexibly to the diverse
and evolving data distributions. In light of this view, we propose a novel
approach, Mixture of Expert Prompt Tuning (MEPT), as an effective and efficient
manifold-mapping framework. MEPT leverages the Mixture of Experts architecture
by integrating multiple prompt experts to adaptively learn diverse and
non-stationary data distributions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MEPT
outperforms several state-of-the-art parameter efficient baselines on
SuperGLUE, achieving notable improvements in mean accuracy (e.g., 1.94%) while
significantly reducing activated prompts by 79.25%. The effectiveness of MEPT
is further supported by theoretical insights from manifold learning and
validated through neural activation pathway visualization results. Our code is
avaliable at https://github.com/runtsang/MEPT.

TL;DR: FlexMDM是一种灵活的掩码扩散模型，能够处理可变长度序列生成，解决了传统MDM只能生成固定长度序列的限制，同时在数学和代码填充任务上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统掩码扩散模型(MDMs)虽然具有并行生成和任意顺序推理的优势，但无法支持token插入，只能生成固定长度的序列，这限制了其应用范围

Method: 基于随机插值框架扩展，通过插入掩码token并逐步去掩码的方式生成序列，支持可变长度序列生成，同时保持任意顺序推理的灵活性

Result: 在困惑度方面与MDMs相当，但长度统计建模更准确；在迷宫规划任务上成功率提高约60%；将LLaDA-8B微调为FlexMDM后，数学推理(GSM8K)从58%提升到67%，代码填充从52%提升到65%

Conclusion: FlexMDM成功解决了MDM固定长度生成的限制，实现了可变长度序列的高效生成，在保持原有优势的同时显著提升了多项任务的性能表现

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive models over discrete domains. MDMs generate
sequences in an any-order, parallel fashion, enabling fast inference and strong
performance on non-causal tasks. However, a crucial limitation is that they do
not support token insertions and are thus limited to fixed-length generations.
To this end, we introduce Flexible Masked Diffusion Models (FlexMDMs), a
discrete diffusion paradigm that simultaneously can model sequences of flexible
length while provably retaining MDMs' flexibility of any-order inference.
Grounded in an extension of the stochastic interpolant framework, FlexMDMs
generate sequences by inserting mask tokens and unmasking them. Empirically, we
show that FlexMDMs match MDMs in perplexity while modeling length statistics
with much higher fidelity. On a synthetic maze planning task, they achieve
$\approx 60 \%$ higher success rate than MDM baselines. Finally, we show
pretrained MDMs can easily be retrofitted into FlexMDMs: on 16 H100s, it takes
only three days to fine-tune LLaDA-8B into a FlexMDM, achieving superior
performance on math (GSM8K, $58\% \to 67\%$) and code infilling performance
($52\% \to 65\%$).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了TPRL-DG框架，使用强化学习进行时序保持的领域泛化，解决可穿戴传感器人体活动识别中的跨用户泛化问题，无需目标用户标注即可实现优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可穿戴传感器的人体活动识别在医疗健康和智能环境中很重要，但跨用户变异性（运动模式、传感器位置、生理特征差异）导致传统监督学习方法在未见用户上泛化性能差，现有领域泛化方法常忽略时序依赖或需要不切实际的领域标签。

Method: TPRL-DG框架将特征提取重新定义为强化学习驱动的序列决策过程，使用基于Transformer的自回归生成器产生捕获用户不变活动动态的时序token，通过多目标奖励函数优化，平衡类别区分和跨用户不变性。关键创新包括：RL驱动的领域泛化方法、保持时序一致性的自回归token化、无需标签的奖励设计。

Result: 在DSADS和PAMAP2数据集上的评估显示，TPRL-DG在跨用户泛化方面超越了最先进方法，无需逐用户校准即可实现优越准确率。

Conclusion: 通过学习鲁棒的用户不变时序模式，TPRL-DG实现了可扩展的人体活动识别系统，推动个性化医疗、自适应健身追踪和情境感知环境的发展。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors is crucial for
healthcare, fitness tracking, and smart environments, yet cross-user
variability -- stemming from diverse motion patterns, sensor placements, and
physiological traits -- hampers generalization in real-world settings.
Conventional supervised learning methods often overfit to user-specific
patterns, leading to poor performance on unseen users. Existing domain
generalization approaches, while promising, frequently overlook temporal
dependencies or depend on impractical domain-specific labels. We propose
Temporal-Preserving Reinforcement Learning Domain Generalization (TPRL-DG), a
novel framework that redefines feature extraction as a sequential
decision-making process driven by reinforcement learning. TPRL-DG leverages a
Transformer-based autoregressive generator to produce temporal tokens that
capture user-invariant activity dynamics, optimized via a multi-objective
reward function balancing class discrimination and cross-user invariance. Key
innovations include: (1) an RL-driven approach for domain generalization, (2)
autoregressive tokenization to preserve temporal coherence, and (3) a
label-free reward design eliminating the need for target user annotations.
Evaluations on the DSADS and PAMAP2 datasets show that TPRL-DG surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in cross-user generalization, achieving superior
accuracy without per-user calibration. By learning robust, user-invariant
temporal patterns, TPRL-DG enables scalable HAR systems, facilitating
advancements in personalized healthcare, adaptive fitness tracking, and
context-aware environments.

Abstract: Synthesis procedures play a critical role in materials research, as they
directly affect material properties. With data-driven approaches increasingly
accelerating materials discovery, there is growing interest in extracting
synthesis procedures from scientific literature as structured data. However,
existing studies often rely on rigid, domain-specific schemas with predefined
fields for structuring synthesis procedures or assume that synthesis procedures
are linear sequences of operations, which limits their ability to capture the
structural complexity of real-world procedures. To address these limitations,
we adopt PROV-DM, an international standard for provenance information, which
supports flexible, graph-based modeling of procedures. We present MatPROV, a
dataset of PROV-DM-compliant synthesis procedures extracted from scientific
literature using large language models. MatPROV captures structural
complexities and causal relationships among materials, operations, and
conditions through visually intuitive directed graphs. This representation
enables machine-interpretable synthesis knowledge, opening opportunities for
future research such as automated synthesis planning and optimization.

TL;DR: 提出基于大型脑模型LaBraM的相关注意力映射方法，利用IMU数据中的空间通道关系来识别EEG信号中的运动相关伪影，显著提升运动场景下的鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号信噪比低，运动伪影是脑机接口实际部署的主要挑战。现有方法多为单模态（如ASR、ICA），未充分利用IMU等同时记录的模态数据来直接捕捉运动动态

Method: 使用微调的大型脑模型LaBraM，基于相关性注意力映射，利用IMU数据的空间通道关系识别EEG运动伪影。模型约920万参数，仅使用5.9小时EEG-IMU数据训练

Result: 与ASR-ICA基准方法相比，在不同时间尺度和运动活动下，结合IMU参考信号显著提高了各种运动场景下的鲁棒性

Conclusion: 多模态方法（结合IMU）相比单模态方法能更有效地去除EEG运动伪影，为脑机接口的实际应用提供了更可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method for measuring brain
activity with high temporal resolution; however, EEG signals often exhibit low
signal-to-noise ratios because of contamination from physiological and
environmental artifacts. One of the major challenges hindering the real-world
deployment of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) involves the frequent occurrence
of motion-related EEG artifacts. Most prior studies on EEG motion artifact
removal rely on single-modality approaches, such as Artifact Subspace
Reconstruction (ASR) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), without
incorporating simultaneously recorded modalities like inertial measurement
units (IMUs), which directly capture the extent and dynamics of motion. This
work proposes a fine-tuned large brain model (LaBraM)-based correlation
attention mapping method that leverages spatial channel relationships in IMU
data to identify motion-related artifacts in EEG signals. The fine-tuned model
contains approximately 9.2 million parameters and uses 5.9 hours of EEG and IMU
recordings for training, just 0.2346\% of the 2500 hours used to train the base
model. We compare our results against the established ASR-ICA benchmark across
varying time scales and motion activities, showing that incorporating IMU
reference signals significantly improves robustness under diverse motion
scenarios.

Conclusion: RefineStat框架有效解决了小语言模型生成概率程序时的可靠性问题，通过约束强制执行和细化策略实现了高质量的代码生成。

Abstract: Probabilistic programming offers a powerful framework for modeling
uncertainty, yet statistical model discovery in this domain entails navigating
an immense search space under strict domain-specific constraints. When small
language models are tasked with generating probabilistic programs, they
frequently produce outputs that suffer from both syntactic and semantic errors,
such as flawed inference constructs. Motivated by probabilistic programmers'
domain expertise and debugging strategies, we introduce RefineStat, a language
model--driven framework that enforces semantic constraints ensuring synthesized
programs contain valid distributions and well-formed parameters, and then
applies diagnostic-aware refinement by resampling prior or likelihood
components whenever reliability checks fail. We evaluate RefineStat on multiple
probabilistic-programming code-generation tasks using smaller language models
(SLMs) and find that it produces programs that are both syntactically sound and
statistically reliable, often matching or surpassing those from closed-source
large language models (e.g., OpenAI o3).

Abstract: Time Series Anomaly Detection metrics serve as crucial tools for model
evaluation. However, existing metrics suffer from several limitations:
insufficient discriminative power, strong hyperparameter dependency,
sensitivity to perturbations, and high computational overhead. This paper
introduces Confidence-Consistency Evaluation (CCE), a novel evaluation metric
that simultaneously measures prediction confidence and uncertainty consistency.
By employing Bayesian estimation to quantify the uncertainty of anomaly scores,
we construct both global and event-level confidence and consistency scores for
model predictions, resulting in a concise CCE metric. Theoretically and
experimentally, we demonstrate that CCE possesses strict boundedness, Lipschitz
robustness against score perturbations, and linear time complexity
$\mathcal{O}(n)$. Furthermore, we establish RankEval, a benchmark for comparing
the ranking capabilities of various metrics. RankEval represents the first
standardized and reproducible evaluation pipeline that enables objective
comparison of evaluation metrics. Both CCE and RankEval implementations are
fully open-source.

Result: 在多个数据集上进行的广泛实验显示，SC-GIR在不同SNR条件下对压缩数据达到超过85%的分类准确率，性能超过基线方案近10%。

Conclusion: 证明了提出的SC-GIR框架能够有效学习简洁且信息丰富的潜在表征，为目标导向语义通信系统提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Goal-oriented semantic communication (SC) aims to revolutionize communication
systems by transmitting only task-essential information. However, current
approaches face challenges such as joint training at transceivers, leading to
redundant data exchange and reliance on labeled datasets, which limits their
task-agnostic utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework called Goal-oriented Invariant Representation-based SC (SC-GIR) for
image transmission. Our framework leverages self-supervised learning to extract
an invariant representation that encapsulates crucial information from the
source data, independent of the specific downstream task. This compressed
representation facilitates efficient communication while retaining key features
for successful downstream task execution. Focusing on machine-to-machine tasks,
we utilize covariance-based contrastive learning techniques to obtain a latent
representation that is both meaningful and semantically dense. To evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme on downstream tasks, we apply it to
various image datasets for lossy compression. The compressed representations
are then used in a goal-oriented AI task. Extensive experiments on several
datasets demonstrate that SC-GIR outperforms baseline schemes by nearly 10%,,
and achieves over 85% classification accuracy for compressed data under
different SNR conditions. These results underscore the effectiveness of the
proposed framework in learning compact and informative latent representations.

Abstract: Emotion recognition based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals is
increasingly becoming a key research hotspot in affective Brain-Computer
Interfaces (aBCIs). However, the current transfer learning model greatly
depends on the source domain and target domain data, which hinder the practical
application of emotion recognition. Therefore, we propose a Multi-domain
Aggregation Transfer Learning framework for EEG emotion recognition with
Domain-Class prototype under unseen targets (MATL-DC). We design the feature
decoupling module to decouple class-invariant domain features from
domain-invariant class features from shallow features. In the model training
stage, the multi-domain aggregation mechanism aggregates the domain feature
space to form a superdomain, which enhances the characteristics of emotional
EEG signals. In each superdomain, we further extract the class prototype
representation by class features. In addition, we adopt the pairwise learning
strategy to transform the sample classification problem into the similarity
problem between sample pairs, which effectively alleviates the influence of
label noise. It is worth noting that the target domain is completely unseen
during the training process. In the inference stage, we use the trained
domain-class prototypes for inference, and then realize emotion recognition. We
rigorously validate it on the publicly available databases (SEED, SEED-IV and
SEED-V). The results show that the accuracy of MATL-DC model is 84.70\%,
68.11\% and 61.08\%, respectively. MATL-DC achieves comparable or even better
performance than methods that rely on both source and target domains. The

Abstract: Performative prediction is an emerging paradigm in machine learning that
addresses scenarios where the model's prediction may induce a shift in the
distribution of the data it aims to predict. Current works in this field often
rely on uncontrollable assumptions, such as bounded gradients of performative
loss, and primarily focus on linear cases in their examples and evaluations to
maintain consistency between theoretical guarantees and empirical validations.
However, such linearity rarely holds in real-world applications, where the data
usually exhibit complex nonlinear characteristics. In this paper, we relax
these out-of-control assumptions and present a novel design that generalizes
performative prediction to nonlinear cases while preserving essential
theoretical properties. Specifically, we formulate the loss function of
performative prediction using a maximum margin approach and extend it to
nonlinear spaces through kernel methods. To quantify the data distribution
shift, we employ the discrepancy between prediction errors on these two
distributions as an indicator, which characterizes the impact of the
performative effect on specific learning tasks. By doing so, we can derive, for
both linear and nonlinear cases, the conditions for performative stability, a
critical and desirable property in performative contexts. Building on these
theoretical insights, we develop an algorithm that guarantees the performative
stability of the predictive model. We validate the effectiveness of our method
through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets with both linear and
nonlinear data distributions, demonstrating superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 自适应深度消息传递机制能够更好地适应节点多样性，提高GNN模型性能

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven to be highly effective in various
graph learning tasks. A key characteristic of GNNs is their use of a fixed
number of message-passing steps for all nodes in the graph, regardless of each
node's diverse computational needs and characteristics. Through empirical
real-world data analysis, we demonstrate that the optimal number of
message-passing layers varies for nodes with different characteristics. This
finding is further supported by experiments conducted on synthetic datasets. To
address this, we propose Adaptive Depth Message Passing GNN (ADMP-GNN), a novel
framework that dynamically adjusts the number of message passing layers for
each node, resulting in improved performance. This approach applies to any
model that follows the message passing scheme. We evaluate ADMP-GNN on the node
classification task and observe performance improvements over baseline GNN
models.

Abstract: The Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) network has attracted widespread
research interest due to its enhanced capability to model complex temporal

unknown, intricate, and hierarchical dynamics. In this work, we propose a
stochastic xLSTM, termed StoxLSTM, that improves the original architecture into
a state space modeling framework by incorporating stochastic latent variables
within xLSTM. StoxLSTM models the latent dynamic evolution through specially
designed recurrent blocks, enabling it to effectively capture the underlying
temporal patterns and dependencies. Extensive experiments on publicly available
benchmark datasets from multiple research communities demonstrate that StoxLSTM
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with better robustness and
stronger generalization ability.

### [537] [Preserving Vector Space Properties in Dimensionality Reduction: A Relationship Preserving Loss Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01198)
*Eddi Weinwurm,Alexander Kovalenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Relationship Preserving Loss (RPL)损失函数，通过最小化高维数据和低维嵌入之间的关系矩阵差异来保持向量空间的正交性和线性独立性等关键属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降维过程会扭曲向量空间的正交性和线性独立性等关键属性，这些属性对于跨模态检索、聚类和分类等任务至关重要。

Method: 使用关系保持损失(RPL)，通过最小化高维数据和低维嵌入之间的关系矩阵（如Gram矩阵或余弦矩阵）的差异来训练神经网络进行非线性投影，并基于矩阵扰动理论推导误差边界。

Result: 初步实验表明，RPL能够在减少嵌入维度的同时，在很大程度上保持下游任务的性能，这归因于其对关键向量空间属性的保持。

Conclusion: RPL不仅适用于降维，还可广泛应用于跨域对齐和迁移学习、知识蒸馏、公平性和不变性、去中心化、图和流形学习以及联邦学习等领域，确保分布式嵌入保持几何一致性。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction can distort vector space properties such as
orthogonality and linear independence, which are critical for tasks including
cross-modal retrieval, clustering, and classification. We propose a
Relationship Preserving Loss (RPL), a loss function that preserves these
properties by minimizing discrepancies between relationship matrices (e.g.,
Gram or cosine) of high-dimensional data and their low-dimensional embeddings.
RPL trains neural networks for non-linear projections and is supported by error
bounds derived from matrix perturbation theory. Initial experiments suggest
that RPL reduces embedding dimensions while largely retaining performance on
downstream tasks, likely due to its preservation of key vector space
properties. While we describe here the use of RPL in dimensionality reduction,
this loss can also be applied more broadly, for example to cross-domain
alignment and transfer learning, knowledge distillation, fairness and
invariance, dehubbing, graph and manifold learning, and federated learning,
where distributed embeddings must remain geometrically consistent.

Conclusion: 该框架为理解学习物理机制提供了新视角，使深度网络能够将新信息整合到现有知识结构中，推动生物与人工智能系统的对齐发展

Abstract: How to balance training accuracy and adversarial robustness has become a
challenge since the birth of deep learning. Here, we introduce a geometry-aware
deep learning framework that leverages layer-wise local training to sculpt the
internal representations of deep neural networks. This framework promotes
intra-class compactness and inter-class separation in feature space, leading to
manifold smoothness and adversarial robustness against white or black box
attacks. The performance can be explained by an energy model with Hebbian
coupling between elements of the hidden representation. Our results thus shed
light on the physics of learning in the direction of alignment between
biological and artificial intelligence systems. Using the current framework,
the deep network can assimilate new information into existing knowledge
structures while reducing representation interference.

*Niklas Kemper,Tom Wollschläger,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文批评了当前GNN表达性理论的局限性，提出了消息传递复杂度(MPC)作为新的评估框架，能够更好地衡量GNN在实际任务中的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN表达性理论存在两个主要问题：一是对大多数实际任务而言，超越基本WL测试的表达性并非必需；二是表达性理论的二元分类和理想化假设无法反映GNN的实际能力。

Method: 提出了消息传递复杂度(MPC)这一连续度量指标，量化GNN架构通过消息传递解决给定任务的难度，同时捕捉实际限制如过度压缩等问题。

Result: 通过在基础GNN任务上的广泛验证，MPC的理论预测与实证性能相关，成功解释了架构的成功与失败。

Conclusion: MPC超越了表达性理论，为理解和改进GNN架构提供了更强大和细致的框架，有效缩小了理论与实践之间的差距。

Abstract: Expressivity theory, characterizing which graphs a GNN can distinguish, has
become the predominant framework for analyzing GNNs, with new models striving
for higher expressivity. However, we argue that this focus is misguided: First,
higher expressivity is not necessary for most real-world tasks as these tasks
rarely require expressivity beyond the basic WL test. Second, expressivity
theory's binary characterization and idealized assumptions fail to reflect
GNNs' practical capabilities. To overcome these limitations, we propose Message
Passing Complexity (MPC): a continuous measure that quantifies the difficulty
for a GNN architecture to solve a given task through message passing. MPC
captures practical limitations like over-squashing while preserving the
theoretical impossibility results from expressivity theory, effectively
narrowing the gap between theory and practice. Through extensive validation on
fundamental GNN tasks, we show that MPC's theoretical predictions correlate
with empirical performance, successfully explaining architectural successes and
failures. Thereby, MPC advances beyond expressivity theory to provide a more
powerful and nuanced framework for understanding and improving GNN
architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种去中心化的多智能体强化学习框架，通过共享约束向量实现隐式协调，解决了边缘计算中资源竞争问题，在有限观测和通信约束下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘计算系统中，自主智能体需要在共享资源竞争环境下快速做出本地决策。现有MARL方法依赖集中式评论家或频繁通信，在有限观测和通信约束下效果不佳。

Method: 每个智能体解决约束马尔可夫决策过程(CMDP)，通过共享约束向量进行隐式协调。约束防止共享服务器资源过载，约束更新频率低，作为轻量级协调机制。使用安全强化学习使智能体学习满足本地和全局目标的策略。

Result: 在理论分析中建立了温和假设下的理论保证，实验验证表明该方法在大型设置中优于集中式和独立基线方法，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 该去中心化框架通过共享约束向量实现了有效的隐式协调，在有限通信和观测条件下能够很好地平衡本地决策和全局资源使用目标，特别适用于大规模边缘计算场景。

Abstract: In edge computing systems, autonomous agents must make fast local decisions
while competing for shared resources. Existing MARL methods often resume to
centralized critics or frequent communication, which fail under limited
observability and communication constraints. We propose a decentralized
framework in which each agent solves a constrained Markov decision process
(CMDP), coordinating implicitly through a shared constraint vector. For the
specific case of offloading, e.g., constraints prevent overloading shared
server resources. Coordination constraints are updated infrequently and act as
a lightweight coordination mechanism. They enable agents to align with global
resource usage objectives but require little direct communication. Using safe
reinforcement learning, agents learn policies that meet both local and global
goals. We establish theoretical guarantees under mild assumptions and validate
our approach experimentally, showing improved performance over centralized and
independent baselines, especially in large-scale settings.

Motivation: LLM在需要组合规则和分布外示例的推理任务中面临系统泛化挑战，特别是在数学推理方面表现有限

Method: 采用迭代示例选择策略，逐步构建针对特定任务优化的少样本示例集，结合显式推理指令

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效提升LLM的泛化性能，且简单示例比复杂示例更能促进模型泛化

Conclusion: 迭代示例选择策略结合显式推理指令能显著改善LLM在系统泛化任务上的表现，为提升模型推理能力提供了有效方法

Abstract: LLMs face significant challenges in systematic generalization, particularly
when dealing with reasoning tasks requiring compositional rules and handling
out-of-distribution examples. To address these challenges, we introduce an
in-context learning methodology that improves the generalization capabilities
of general purpose LLMs. Our approach employs an iterative example selection
strategy, which incrementally constructs a tailored set of few-shot examples
optimized to enhance model's performance on a given task. As a proof of
concept, we apply this methodology to the resolution of algebraic expressions
involving non-standard simplification rules, according to which the priority of
addition and multiplication is changed.
  Our findings indicate that LLMs exhibit limited proficiency in these
mathematical tasks. We further demonstrate that LLMs reasoning benefits from
our iterative shot selection prompting strategy integrated with explicit
reasoning instructions. Crucially, our experiments reveal that some LLMs
achieve better generalization performances when prompted with simpler few-shot
examples rather than complex ones following the test data distribution.

Motivation: 在计算昂贵的仿真环境中，现有采样策略对于宽状态空间的效率不足，需要更有效的方法来减少样本需求并提升替代模型性能。

Method: 使用强化学习训练的策略来采样确定性仿真环境，构建包含随机代理、专家代理和最大熵状态转移分布探索代理的混合数据集，并与拉丁超立方采样、主动学习和克里金法进行交叉验证比较。

Result: 混合数据集在所有采样数据集上获得最佳评分，对状态空间表示至关重要，证明了该方法在样本效率和模型性能上的显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法改进了现有技术，为在复杂仿真器上应用替代辅助的强化学习策略优化开辟了道路。

Abstract: Sample efficiency in the face of computationally expensive simulations is a
common concern in surrogate modeling. Current strategies to minimize the number
of samples needed are not as effective in simulated environments with wide
state spaces. As a response to this challenge, we propose a novel method to
efficiently sample simulated deterministic environments by using policies
trained by Reinforcement Learning. We provide an extensive analysis of these
surrogate-building strategies with respect to Latin-Hypercube sampling or
Active Learning and Kriging, cross-validating performances with all sampled
datasets. The analysis shows that a mixed dataset that includes samples
acquired by random agents, expert agents, and agents trained to explore the
regions of maximum entropy of the state transition distribution provides the
best scores through all datasets, which is crucial for a meaningful state space
representation. We conclude that the proposed method improves the
state-of-the-art and clears the path to enable the application of
surrogate-aided Reinforcement Learning policy optimization strategies on
complex simulators.

TL;DR: 提出了一种等变U形神经算子(E-UNO)，用于高效学习Cahn-Hilliard方程控制的相分离过程，通过结合全局谱卷积和多分辨率架构，在保持物理对称性的同时准确预测相场演化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值求解器计算成本高且缺乏灵活性，现有神经算子架构难以捕捉多尺度行为并忽略物理对称性，需要开发更高效的替代方法。

Method: 采用等变U形神经算子架构，结合全局谱卷积和多分辨率U形结构，通过调节平移等变性来保持物理对称性，从短历史动态中学习相场演化。

Result: E-UNO在精细尺度和高频结构上优于标准傅里叶神经算子和U形神经算子基线，具有更好的泛化能力、更少的训练数据需求，并能产生物理一致的动力学行为。

Conclusion: E-UNO通过编码对称性和尺度层次结构，成为复杂相场系统的高效替代模型，为材料科学和软物质中的界面动力学研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Phase separation in binary mixtures, governed by the Cahn-Hilliard equation,
plays a central role in interfacial dynamics across materials science and soft
matter. While numerical solvers are accurate, they are often computationally
expensive and lack flexibility across varying initial conditions and
geometries. Neural operators provide a data-driven alternative by learning
solution operators between function spaces, but current architectures often
fail to capture multiscale behavior and neglect underlying physical symmetries.
Here we show that an equivariant U-shaped neural operator (E-UNO) can learn the
evolution of the phase-field variable from short histories of past dynamics,
achieving accurate predictions across space and time. The model combines global
spectral convolution with a multi-resolution U-shaped architecture and
regulates translation equivariance to align with the underlying physics. E-UNO
outperforms standard Fourier neural operator and U-shaped neural operator
baselines, particularly on fine-scale and high-frequency structures. By
encoding symmetry and scale hierarchy, the model generalizes better, requires
less training data, and yields physically consistent dynamics. This establishes
E-UNO as an efficient surrogate for complex phase-field systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种基于重构不确定性估计(RUE)的预测区间方法，用于生命体征预测中的不确定性量化，以提高临床决策的可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在生命体征预测中表现良好，但由于缺乏可靠的不确定性量化，特别是校准的预测区间，临床医生难以信任和解释模型输出，这限制了模型在医疗领域的部署。

Method: 提出了两种方法：1) 参数化方法 - 假设预测误差和不确定性估计遵循高斯copula分布，实现闭式预测区间计算；2) 非参数化方法 - 基于k近邻(KNN)，使用相似的验证实例经验估计条件误差分布。

Result: 在两个大型公共数据集上的实验表明，高斯copula方法在低频数据上持续优于conformal预测基线，而KNN方法在高频数据上表现最佳。

Conclusion: RUE衍生的预测区间方法在提供可解释、不确定性感知的生命体征预测方面具有临床前景，能够支持更可靠的临床决策。

Abstract: Vital signs, such as heart rate and blood pressure, are critical indicators
of patient health and are widely used in clinical monitoring and
decision-making. While deep learning models have shown promise in forecasting
these signals, their deployment in healthcare remains limited in part because
clinicians must be able to trust and interpret model outputs. Without reliable
uncertainty quantification -- particularly calibrated prediction intervals
(PIs) -- it is unclear whether a forecasted abnormality constitutes a
meaningful warning or merely reflects model noise, hindering clinical
decision-making. To address this, we present two methods for deriving PIs from
the Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimate (RUE), an uncertainty measure
well-suited to vital-sign forecasting due to its sensitivity to data shifts and
support for label-free calibration. Our parametric approach assumes that
prediction errors and uncertainty estimates follow a Gaussian copula
distribution, enabling closed-form PI computation. Our non-parametric approach,
based on k-nearest neighbours (KNN), empirically estimates the conditional
error distribution using similar validation instances. We evaluate these
methods on two large public datasets with minute- and hour-level sampling,
representing high- and low-frequency health signals. Experiments demonstrate
that the Gaussian copula method consistently outperforms conformal prediction
baselines on low-frequency data, while the KNN approach performs best on
high-frequency data. These results underscore the clinical promise of
RUE-derived PIs for delivering interpretable, uncertainty-aware vital sign
forecasts.

Motivation: 现有大型推理模型的强化学习方法需要大量计算资源和数据集，导致训练成本高且数据效率低

Method: 结合离线阶段基于多样性、影响力和适当难度的高质量数据筛选，以及在线阶段基于探索性度量的动态样本过滤和重放机制

Result: 在五个推理基准测试中表现优于现有方法，仅用20%训练数据就在AIME24上实现1.85倍加速，AIME25上实现1.66倍加速

Conclusion: DEPO通过高效的数据选择策略显著提升了RLVR训练的数据效率和计算效率，为大规模推理模型的训练提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have leveraged reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to improve reasoning capabilities.
However, scaling these methods typically requires extensive rollout computation
and large datasets, leading to high training costs and low data efficiency. To
mitigate this issue, we propose DEPO, a Data-Efficient Policy Optimization
pipeline that combines optimized strategies for both offline and online data
selection. In the offline phase, we curate a high-quality subset of training
samples based on diversity, influence, and appropriate difficulty. During
online RLVR training, we introduce a sample-level explorability metric to
dynamically filter samples with low exploration potential, thereby reducing
substantial rollout computational costs. Furthermore, we incorporate a replay
mechanism for under-explored samples to ensure adequate training, which
enhances the model's final convergence performance. Experiments across five
reasoning benchmarks show that DEPO consistently outperforms existing methods
in both offline and online data selection scenarios. Notably, using only 20% of
the training data, our approach achieves a 1.85 times speed-up on AIME24 and a
1.66 times speed-up on AIME25 compared to GRPO trained on the full dataset.

Motivation: 工业级电池管理涉及多种任务，每种任务使用不同的数据，构建任务特定方法需要大量数据和工程工作，限制了智能电池管理的可扩展性。

Method: 提出灵活掩码自编码器(FMAE)框架，能够处理缺失的电池数据通道，捕捉数据片段间的相互关联，从异构数据学习统一表示。

Result: 在5个电池管理任务和11个电池数据集上，FMAE始终优于所有任务特定方法；在剩余寿命预测任务中，使用50倍少的推理数据仍保持最先进结果；即使缺少某些信息(如系统电压)，FMAE仍能应用且性能影响很小。

Conclusion: FMAE展示了实现灵活、数据高效模型的实用途径，简化了动态系统多任务管理的实际应用。

Abstract: Industrial-scale battery management involves various types of tasks, such as
estimation, prediction, and system-level diagnostics. Each task employs
distinct data across temporal scales, sensor resolutions, and data channels.
Building task-specific methods requires a great deal of data and engineering
effort, which limits the scalability of intelligent battery management. Here we
present the Flexible Masked Autoencoder (FMAE), a flexible pretraining
framework that can learn with missing battery data channels and capture
inter-correlations across data snippets. FMAE learns unified battery
representations from heterogeneous data and can be adopted by different tasks
with minimal data and engineering efforts. Experimentally, FMAE consistently
outperforms all task-specific methods across five battery management tasks with
eleven battery datasets. On remaining life prediction tasks, FMAE uses 50 times
less inference data while maintaining state-of-the-art results. Moreover, when
real-world data lack certain information, such as system voltage, FMAE can
still be applied with marginal performance impact, achieving comparable results
with the best hand-crafted features. FMAE demonstrates a practical route to a
flexible, data-efficient model that simplifies real-world multi-task management
of dynamical systems.

Conclusion: 基于复活理论的优化框架为局部优化方法提供了数学上严谨的全局指导，克服了传统启发式自适应方法的局限性

Abstract: Modern optimization faces a fundamental challenge: local gradient-based
methods provide no global information about the objective function $L$
landscape, often leading to suboptimal convergence and sensitivity to
initialization. We introduce a novel optimization framework that leverages
resurgence theory from complex analysis to extract global structural
information from divergent asymptotic series. Our key insight is that the
factorially divergent perturbative expansions of parameter space partition
functions encode precise information about all critical objective function
value in the landscape through their Borel transform singularities.
  The algorithm works by computing the statistical mechanical partition
function $Z(g) = \int e^{-L(\theta)/g} d\theta$ for small coupling $g\ll 1$,
extracting its asymptotic series coefficients, and identifying Borel plane
singularities that correspond one-to-one with critical objective function
values. These target values provide global guidance to local optimizers,
enabling principled learning rate adaptation and escape from suboptimal
regions. Unlike heuristic adaptive methods, targets are theoretically grounded
in the geometry of the optimization landscape.

Conclusion: AT损失函数有效解决了CSI在干旱期的局限性，为降水预测提供了更可靠的优化标准。

Abstract: Accurate precipitation forecasting is becoming increasingly important in the
context of climate change. In response, machine learning-based approaches have
recently gained attention as an emerging alternative to traditional methods
such as numerical weather prediction and climate models. Nonetheless, many
recent approaches still rely on off-the-shelf loss functions, and even the more
advanced ones merely involve optimization processes based on the critical
success index (CSI). The problem, however, is that CSI may become ineffective
during extended dry periods when precipitation remains below the threshold,
rendering it less than ideal as a criterion for optimization. To address this
limitation, we introduce a simple penalty expression and reinterpret it as a
quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation. Ultimately, the
resulting QUBO formulation is relaxed into a differentiable advanced torrential
(AT) loss function through an approximation process. The proposed AT loss
demonstrates its superiority through the Lipschitz constant, forecast
performance evaluations, consistency experiments, and ablation studies with the
operational model.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel generative method to identify the causal
impact and apply it to prediction tasks. We conduct causal impact analysis
using interventional and counterfactual perspectives. First, applying
interventions, we identify features that have a causal influence on the
predicted outcome, which we refer to as causally sensitive features, and
second, applying counterfactuals, we evaluate how changes in the cause affect
the effect. Our method exploits the Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)
to identify the causal impact and serve as a generative predictor. We are able
to reduce confounding bias by identifying causally sensitive features. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by recommending the most likely
locations a user will visit next in their spatiotemporal trajectory influenced
by the causal relationships among various features. Experiments on the
large-scale GeoLife [Zheng et al., 2010] dataset and the benchmark Asia
Bayesian network validate the ability of our method to identify causal impact
and improve predictive performance.

Abstract: Current open-source training pipelines for Chinese medical language models
predominantly emphasize optimizing training methodologies to enhance the
performance of large language models (LLMs), yet lack comprehensive exploration
into training data processing. To address this gap, we propose DPF-CM, a
holistic Data Processing Framework for Chinese Medical LLMs training and
deployment. DPF-CM comprises two core modules. The first module is a data
processing pipeline tailored for model training. Beyond standard data
processing operations, we (1) introduce a chained examples context-learning
strategy to generate question-oriented instructions to mitigate the lack of
instruction content, and (2) implement an ensemble-based filtering mechanism
for preference data curation that averages multiple reward models to suppress
noisy samples. The second module focuses on privacy preservation during model
deployment. To prevent privacy risks from the inadvertent exposure of training
data, we propose a Privacy Preserving Vector Database (PPVD) approach, which
involves model memory search, high-risk database construction, secure database
construction, and match-and-replace, four key stages to minimize privacy
leakage during inference collectively. Experimental results show that DPF-CM
significantly improves model accuracy, enabling our trained Chinese medical LLM
to achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source counterparts.
Moreover, the framework reduces training data privacy leakage by 27%.

Latent Diffusion Model. Based on the original latent diffusion model, the
sampling steps of the diffusion model are reduced and the sample generation
efficiency is improved by using the conditional prior to estimate conditional
posterior distribution, which is the approximated distribution of p(z|x). In
addition, this article uses the Laplacian matrix instead of the distance matrix
to recover the nanostructure, which can reduce the reconstruction error.
Finally, this article compares CbLDM with existing models which were used to
solve the nanostructure inverse problem, and find that CbLDM demonstrates
significantly higher prediction accuracy than these models, which reflects the
ability of CbLDM to solve the nanostructure inverse problem and the potential
to cope with other continuous conditional generation tasks.

Motivation: 传统消息传递架构难以充分建模节点和图预测任务中的长距离依赖关系

Method: 利用分层图结构和自适应随机游走，引入可学习的转移概率来决定游走是偏好原始图还是跨越分层捷径

Result: 在合成长距离任务中，该方法能够超越传统方法在原始拓扑上的理论限制，偏好分层结构的游走可以达到与原始图上更长游走相同的性能

Conclusion: 这些初步发现为高效处理大型图同时有效捕获长距离依赖开辟了有前景的方向

Abstract: Message-passing architectures struggle to sufficiently model long-range
dependencies in node and graph prediction tasks. We propose a novel approach
exploiting hierarchical graph structures and adaptive random walks to address
this challenge. Our method introduces learnable transition probabilities that
decide whether the walk should prefer the original graph or travel across
hierarchical shortcuts. On a synthetic long-range task, we demonstrate that our
approach can exceed the theoretical bound that constrains traditional
approaches operating solely on the original topology. Specifically, walks that
prefer the hierarchy achieve the same performance as longer walks on the
original graph. These preliminary findings open a promising direction for
efficiently processing large graphs while effectively capturing long-range
dependencies.

Motivation: VQ-VAE等离散潜在空间深度生成模型虽然生成能力强，但由于潜在空间巨大，概率推理被认为不可处理

Method: 选择高概率潜在变量子集将VQ-VAE蒸馏为概率电路模型

Result: 在密度估计和条件生成任务中表现竞争力，挑战了VQ-VAE固有不可处理的观念

Conclusion: VQ-VAE可以通过简单策略蒸馏为可处理模型，特别在潜在空间未充分利用时效果显著

Abstract: Deep generative models with discrete latent space, such as the
Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), offer excellent data
generation capabilities, but, due to the large size of their latent space,
their probabilistic inference is deemed intractable. We demonstrate that the
VQ-VAE can be distilled into a tractable model by selecting a subset of latent
variables with high probabilities. This simple strategy is particularly
efficient, especially if the VQ-VAE underutilizes its latent space, which is,
indeed, very often the case. We frame the distilled model as a probabilistic
circuit, and show that it preserves expressiveness of the VQ-VAE while
providing tractable probabilistic inference. Experiments illustrate competitive
performance in density estimation and conditional generation tasks, challenging
the view of the VQ-VAE as an inherently intractable model.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了实例依赖成本敏感(IDCS)分类器在信用评分中应用时，LIME和SHAP解释方法的稳定性，发现虽然IDCS提高了成本效率，但会产生显著不稳定的解释，特别是在类别不平衡增加时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管IDCS分类器在提高信用评分成本效率方面具有潜力，但其对模型解释稳定性的影响尚未被研究，而监管对透明度的要求日益增加。

Method: 使用四个公开信用评分数据集，首先评估IDCS分类器的判别能力和成本效率，引入新指标增强跨数据集可比性；然后通过控制重采样研究SHAP和LIME特征重要性排名在不同类别不平衡程度下的稳定性。

Result: IDCS分类器提高了成本效率，但与传统模型相比产生了显著不稳定的解释，特别是随着类别不平衡增加，这种不稳定性更加明显。

Conclusion: 在监管对可解释性要求日益严格的背景下，本研究强调了解决IDCS分类器稳定性问题的紧迫性，以确保其成本优势不会被不稳定或不可靠的解释所削弱。

Abstract: Instance-dependent cost-sensitive (IDCS) classifiers offer a promising
approach to improving cost-efficiency in credit scoring by tailoring loss
functions to instance-specific costs. However, the impact of such loss
functions on the stability of model explanations remains unexplored in
literature, despite increasing regulatory demands for transparency. This study
addresses this gap by evaluating the stability of Local Interpretable
Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)
when applied to IDCS models. Using four publicly available credit scoring
datasets, we first assess the discriminatory power and cost-efficiency of IDCS
classifiers, introducing a novel metric to enhance cross-dataset comparability.
We then investigate the stability of SHAP and LIME feature importance rankings
under varying degrees of class imbalance through controlled resampling. Our
results reveal that while IDCS classifiers improve cost-efficiency, they
produce significantly less stable explanations compared to traditional models,
particularly as class imbalance increases, highlighting a critical trade-off
between cost optimization and interpretability in credit scoring. Amid
increasing regulatory scrutiny on explainability, this research underscores the
pressing need to address stability issues in IDCS classifiers to ensure that
their cost advantages are not undermined by unstable or untrustworthy
explanations.

TL;DR: MD-PNOP框架通过将参数偏差残差重新构造为附加源项，利用训练好的神经算子离线精化解，实现神经算子的外推泛化能力，在不重新训练的情况下加速参数化PDE求解器收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值求解器在参数化研究和设计优化中存在计算开销大的瓶颈问题，需要一种既能保持物理约束又能加速求解的新方法。

Method: 将参数偏差残差作为附加源项，利用预训练的神经算子（如DeepONet和FNO）提供改进的初始猜测，嵌入迭代PDE求解器中减少收敛迭代次数。

Result: 在单组常数参数上训练的神经算子成功加速了异质、正弦和不连续参数分布的求解，计算时间减少约50%，同时保持全阶保真度。

Conclusion: MD-PNOP框架为参数化PDE求解提供了新的加速范式，解决了神经算子外推限制问题，在保持物理约束的同时显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: The computational overhead of traditional numerical solvers for partial
differential equations (PDEs) remains a critical bottleneck for large-scale
parametric studies and design optimization. We introduce a Minimal-Data
Parametric Neural Operator Preconditioning (MD-PNOP) framework, which
establishes a new paradigm for accelerating parametric PDE solvers while
strictly preserving physical constraints. The key idea is to recast the
residual from parameter deviation as additional source term, where any trained
neural operator can be used to refine the solution in an offline fashion. This
directly addresses the fundamental extrapolation limitation of neural
operators, enabling extrapolative generalization of any neural operator trained
at a single parameter setting across a wide range of configurations without any
retraining. The neural operator predictions are then embedded into iterative
PDE solvers as improved initial guesses, thereby reducing convergence
iterations without sacrificing accuracy. Unlike purely data-driven approaches,
MD-PNOP guarantees that the governing equations remain fully enforced,
eliminating concerns about loss of physics or interpretability. The framework
is architecture-agnostic and is demonstrated using both Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONet) and Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) for Boltzmann transport equation
solvers in neutron transport applications. We demonstrated that neural
operators trained on a single set of constant parameters successfully
accelerate solutions with heterogeneous, sinusoidal, and discontinuous
parameter distributions. Besides, MD-PNOP consistently achieves ~50% reduction
in computational time while maintaining full order fidelity for fixed-source,
single-group eigenvalue, and multigroup coupled eigenvalue problems.

generalize to nonlinear utilities and convex constraints. We illustrate how
this perspective captures robustness, safety, exploration, and diversity
objectives, and outline open challenges at the interface of geometry and deep
RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动描述方法需要高级描述注释的运动数据，但现有数据集缺乏这种注释和低级运动描述，导致模型性能受限。

Method: 1）使用大语言模型为高级描述生成详细的低级运动描述注释；2）提出基于检索的机制，将详细描述与额外文本数据源中的候选高级描述对齐，结合运动特征生成精确的高级描述。

Result: 在三个运动-文本数据集（HumanML3D、KIT和BOTH57M）上进行实验，方法在平均性能（BLEU-1、BLEU-4、CIDEr和ROUGE-L）上比最新的M2T-Interpretable提高6%-50%。

Conclusion: 该方法能够利用外部文本数据源的知识来显著提高运动描述的准确性，尤其是对于现有数据集中未覆盖的运动。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance existing motion captioning
methods, which directly map representations of movement to high-level
descriptive captions (e.g., ``a person doing jumping jacks"). The existing
methods require motion data annotated with high-level descriptions (e.g.,
``jumping jacks"). However, such data is rarely available in existing
motion-text datasets, which additionally do not include low-level motion
descriptions. To address this, we propose a two-step hierarchical approach.
First, we employ large language models to create detailed descriptions
corresponding to each high-level caption that appears in the motion-text
datasets (e.g., ``jumping while synchronizing arm extensions with the opening
and closing of legs" for ``jumping jacks"). These refined annotations are used
to retrain motion-to-text models to produce captions with low-level details.
Second, we introduce a pioneering retrieval-based mechanism. It aligns the
detailed low-level captions with candidate high-level captions from additional
text data sources, and combine them with motion features to fabricate precise
high-level captions. Our methodology is distinctive in its ability to harness
knowledge from external text sources to greatly increase motion captioning
accuracy, especially for movements not covered in existing motion-text
datasets. Experiments on three distinct motion-text datasets (HumanML3D, KIT,
and BOTH57M) demonstrate that our method achieves an improvement in average
performance (across BLEU-1, BLEU-4, CIDEr, and ROUGE-L) ranging from 6% to 50%
compared to the state-of-the-art M2T-Interpretable.

Conclusion: PAFlow通过创新的先验交互指导和原子数预测机制，有效解决了SBDD中的关键挑战，为基于结构的药物设计提供了更稳定和准确的生成解决方案。

Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD), aiming to generate 3D molecules with high
binding affinity toward target proteins, is a vital approach in novel drug
discovery. Although recent generative models have shown great potential, they
suffer from unstable probability dynamics and mismatch between generated
molecule size and the protein pockets geometry, resulting in inconsistent
quality and off-target effects. We propose PAFlow, a novel target-aware
molecular generation model featuring prior interaction guidance and a learnable
atom number predictor. PAFlow adopts the efficient flow matching framework to
model the generation process and constructs a new form of conditional flow
matching for discrete atom types. A protein-ligand interaction predictor is
incorporated to guide the vector field toward higher-affinity regions during
generation, while an atom number predictor based on protein pocket information
is designed to better align generated molecule size with target geometry.
Extensive experiments on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark show that PAFlow
achieves a new state-of-the-art in binding affinity (up to -8.31 Avg. Vina
Score), simultaneously maintains favorable molecular properties.

Result: 在四个公共心电图数据集上的实验验证表明，该方法在识别新异常的同时，能够保持良好的已有心电图信号检测性能。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了心电图异常检测中的类别不平衡和存储限制问题，为临床心电图分析提供了一种有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: In clinical practice, automatic analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely
applied to identify irregular heart rhythms and other electrical anomalies of
the heart, enabling timely intervention and potentially improving clinical
outcomes. However, due to the limited samples in certain types of ECG signals,
the class imbalance issues pose a challenge for ECG-based detection. In
addition, as the volume of patient data grows, long-term storage of all
historical data becomes increasingly burdensome as training samples to
recognize new patterns and classify existing ECG signals accurately. Therefore,
to enhance the performance of anomaly detection while addressing storage
limitations, we propose a pseudo-replay based semi-supervised continual
learning framework, which consists of two components: unsupervised
identification and replay-based detection. For unsupervised identification, an
unsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework is integrated
to detect novel patterns. Besides, instead of directly storing all historical
data, a pseudo replay-based learning strategy is proposed which utilizes a
generator to learn the data distribution for each individual task. When a new
task arises, the generator synthesizes pseudo data representative of previous
learnt classes, enabling the model to detect both the existed patterns and the
newly presented anomalies. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is
validated in four public ECG datasets, which leverages supervised
classification problems for anomaly detection. The experimental results show
that the developed approach is very promising in identifying novel anomalies
while maintaining good performance on detecting existing ECG signals.

Abstract: Microbiomes not only underpin Earth's biogeochemical cycles but also play
crucial roles in both engineered and natural ecosystems, such as the soil,
wastewater treatment, and the human gut. However, microbiome engineering faces
significant obstacles to surmount to deliver the desired improvements in
microbiome control. Here, we use the backpropagation neural network (BPNN),
optimized through differential evolution (DE-BP), to predict the microbial
composition of activated sludge (AS) systems collected from wastewater
treatment plants (WWTPs) located worldwide. Furthermore, we introduce a novel
clustering algorithm termed Directional Position Nonlinear Emotional Preference
Migration Behavior Clustering (DPNG-EPMC). This method is applied to conduct a
clustering analysis of WWTPs across various feature attributes. Finally, we
employ the Similar Time Generative Adversarial Networks (SiTime-GAN), to
synthesize novel microbial compositions and feature attributes data. As a
result, we demonstrate that the DE-BP model can provide superior predictions of
the microbial composition. Additionally, we show that the DPNG-EPMC can be
applied to the analysis of WWTPs under various feature attributes. Finally, we
demonstrate that the SiTime-GAN model can generate valuable incremental
synthetic data. Our results, obtained through predicting the microbial
community and conducting analysis of WWTPs under various feature attributes,
develop an understanding of the factors influencing AS communities.

Conclusion: FoRo为探索预训练模型的持续学习提供了有前景的方向，特别适用于效率和效果都至关重要的现实多媒体应用场景。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central challenge in continual learning
(CL) with pre-trained models. While existing approaches typically freeze the
backbone and fine-tune a small number of parameters to mitigate forgetting,
they still rely on iterative error backpropagation and gradient-based
optimization, which can be computationally intensive and less suitable for
resource-constrained environments. To address this, we propose FoRo, a
forward-only, gradient-free continual learning method. FoRo consists of a
lightweight prompt tuning strategy and a novel knowledge encoding mechanism,
both designed without modifying the pre-trained model. Specifically, prompt
embeddings are inserted at the input layer and optimized using the Covariance
Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), which mitigates distribution
shifts and extracts high-quality task representations. Subsequently,
task-specific knowledge is encoded into a knowledge encoding matrix via
nonlinear random projection and recursive least squares, enabling incremental
updates to the classifier without revisiting prior data. Experiments show that
FoRo significantly reduces average forgetting and improves accuracy. Thanks to
forward-only learning, FoRo reduces memory usage and run time while maintaining
high knowledge retention across long task sequences. These results suggest that
FoRo could serve as a promising direction for exploring continual learning with
pre-trained models, especially in real-world multimedia applications where both
efficiency and effectiveness are critical.

Method: 通过在不同规模的标准数据集、大型分子数据集和合成数据集上进行系统实验，比较GCL与未经训练的GNN、MLP和手工统计特征的性能差异。

Result: 在标准数据集上GCL优势不明显；在ogbg-molhiv大型分子数据集上，GCL在小规模时落后，但超过数千个图后开始领先（虽然最终会达到性能平台）；在合成数据集上，GCL准确率随图数量对数增长，性能差距随任务复杂度变化。

Conclusion: 需要重视数据集规模在基准测试和应用中的作用，并设计能够避免性能平台的GCL算法。

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a leading paradigm for self-
supervised learning on graphs, with strong performance reported on standardized
datasets and growing applications ranging from genomics to drug discovery. We
ask a basic question: does GCL actually outperform untrained baselines? We find
that GCL's advantage depends strongly on dataset size and task difficulty. On
standard datasets, untrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), simple multilayer
perceptrons, and even handcrafted statistics can rival or exceed GCL. On the
large molecular dataset ogbg-molhiv, we observe a crossover: GCL lags at small
scales but pulls ahead beyond a few thousand graphs, though this gain
eventually plateaus. On synthetic datasets, GCL accuracy approximately scales
with the logarithm of the number of graphs and its performance gap (compared
with untrained GNNs) varies with respect to task complexity. Moving forward, it
is crucial to identify the role of dataset size in benchmarks and applications,
as well as to design GCL algorithms that avoid performance plateaus.

Abstract: Conditional Flow Matching(CFM) represents a fast and high-quality approach to
generative modelling, but in many applications it is of interest to steer the
generated samples towards precise requirements. While steering approaches like
gradient-based guidance, sequential Monte Carlo steering or Feynman-Kac
steering are well established for diffusion models, they have not been extended
to flow matching approaches yet. In this work, we formulate this requirement as
tilting the output with an energy potential. We derive, for the first time,
Feynman-Kac steering for CFM. We evaluate our approach on a set of synthetic
tasks, including the generation of tilted distributions in a high-dimensional
space, which is a particularly challenging case for steering approaches. We
then demonstrate the impact of Feynman-Kac steered CFM on the previously
unsolved challenge of generated transition states of chemical reactions with
the correct chirality, where the reactants or products can have a different
handedness, leading to geometric constraints of the viable reaction pathways
connecting reactants and products. Code to reproduce this study is avaiable

Motivation: 随着微调模型的公开，模型合并的安全性问题日益突出，需要有效防止非法合并和保护开发者权益。

Method: 利用Transformer注意力机制的对称性，随机采样两对可逆矩阵并应用到QK和VO分支，保持模型输出不变但使其远离共享参数空间。

Result: 实验表明MergeLock在大多数情况下能将合并模型性能降低95%以上，且无法通过低成本恢复方法有效恢复。

Conclusion: MergeLock提供了一种有效的主动保护方案，能显著防止未经授权的模型合并，增强模型安全性。

Abstract: Model merging leverages multiple finetuned expert models to construct a
multi-task model with low cost, and is gaining increasing attention. However,
as a growing number of finetuned models become publicly available, concerns
about the safety of model merging have emerged. Unauthorized merging may
infringe on developers' rights and risk leaking sensitive personal information.
Most existing methods focus on detecting whether a merged model originates from
a specific source model, but fail to effectively prevent illegal merging. In
this paper, we propose MergeLock, an active protection mechanism that disrupts
model parameters to render them unmergeable, thereby directly preventing
unauthorized model merging. Specifically, leveraging the inherent symmetry of
the attention mechanism in Transformer-based models, we randomly sample two
pairs of invertible matrices and apply them to the Query-Key (QK) and
Value-Output (VO) branches. This transformation keeps the model's output
unchanged while pushing it away from the shared parameter space of other
finetuned models. Extensive experiments across both vision and language tasks
demonstrate that MergeLock can degrade the performance of merged models by over
95% when a protected model is involved in most cases, demonstrating its
effectiveness. Moreover, we further demonstrate that merged models protected by
MergeLock cannot be effectively recovered using low-cost restoration methods,

Abstract: Uplift modeling is a key technique for promotion optimization in recommender
systems, but standard methods typically fail to account for interference, where
treating one item affects the outcomes of others. This violation of the Stable
Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) leads to suboptimal policies in
real-world marketplaces. Recent developments in interference-aware estimators
such as Additive Inverse Propensity Weighting (AddIPW) have not found their way
into the uplift modeling literature yet, and optimising policies using these
estimators is not well-established. This paper proposes a practical methodology
to bridge this gap. We use the AddIPW estimator as a differentiable learning
objective suitable for gradient-based optimization. We demonstrate how this
framework can be integrated with proven response transformation techniques to
directly optimize for economic outcomes like incremental profit. Through
simulations, we show that our approach significantly outperforms
interference-naive methods, especially as interference effects grow.
Furthermore, we find that adapting profit-centric uplift strategies within our
framework can yield superior performance in identifying the highest-impact
interventions, offering a practical path toward more profitable incentive
personalization.

TL;DR: 提出Ema2Vec时间嵌入方法，用于处理生态瞬时评估(EMA)中的不规则时间间隔数据，在纵向压力预测任务中表现优于传统方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动和可穿戴传感技术能够连续监测情感状态，但结合生态自我报告问卷时面临数据缺失和不规则时间间隔的挑战，需要有效建模时间依赖性

Method: 开发Ema2Vec时间嵌入方法，专门处理不规则间隔的自我报告数据，捕捉时间序列中的时间依赖关系

Result: Ema2Vec在纵向压力预测任务中优于依赖固定大小时间窗口的基线方法，以及没有时间感知表示的模型

Conclusion: 在建模不规则采样的纵向数据时，纳入时间嵌入表示至关重要

Abstract: The widespread adoption of mobile and wearable sensing technologies has
enabled continuous and personalized monitoring of affect, mood disorders, and
stress. When combined with ecological self-report questionnaires, these systems
offer a powerful opportunity to explore longitudinal modeling of human
behaviors. However, challenges arise from missing data and the irregular timing
of self-reports, which make challenging the prediction of human states and
behaviors. In this study, we investigate the use of time embeddings to capture
time dependencies within sequences of Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA).
We introduce a novel time embedding method, Ema2Vec, designed to effectively
handle irregularly spaced self-reports, and evaluate it on a new task of
longitudinal stress prediction. Our method outperforms standard stress
prediction baselines that rely on fixed-size daily windows, as well as models
trained directly on longitudinal sequences without time-aware representations.
These findings emphasize the importance of incorporating time embeddings when
modeling irregularly sampled longitudinal data.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种一次性聚类联邦学习(OCFL)算法，能够自动检测最佳聚类时机，无需调整超参数即可实现个性化模型训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的聚类联邦学习(CFL)方法在客户群体聚类方面仍存在挑战，需要解决何时进行聚类以及如何有效区分不同数据分布的问题。

Method: 基于计算客户端梯度间的余弦距离和温度测量来检测联邦模型开始收敛的时刻，自动确定最佳聚类时机，并使用基于密度的聚类方法。

Result: 在5个基准数据集上的40多个任务测试表明，该方法性能良好，能够高效区分不同数据分布下神经网络的损失曲面，并提供本地预测可解释性的新见解。

Conclusion: OCFL算法实现了自动化的聚类联邦学习，证明了基于密度的聚类方法在区分不同数据分布方面的有效性，并为个性化与模型可解释性之间的关系提供了新视角。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a widespread and well-adopted paradigm of
decentralised learning that allows training one model from multiple sources
without the need to transfer data between participating clients directly. Since
its inception in 2015, it has been divided into numerous subfields that deal
with application-specific issues, such as data heterogeneity or resource
allocation. One such sub-field, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL), deals with
the problem of clustering the population of clients into separate cohorts to
deliver personalised models. Although a few remarkable works have been
published in this domain, the problem remains largely unexplored, as its basic
assumptions and settings differ slightly from those of standard FL. In this
work, we present One-Shot Clustered Federated Learning (OCFL), a
clustering-agnostic algorithm that can automatically detect the earliest
suitable moment for clustering. Our algorithm is based on computing the cosine
distance between the gradients of the clients and a temperature measure that
detects when the federated model starts to converge. We empirically evaluate
our methodology by testing various one-shot clustering algorithms for over
forty different tasks on five benchmark datasets. Our experiments showcase the
good performance of our approach when used to perform CFL in an automated
manner without the need to adjust hyperparameters. We also revisit the
practical feasibility of CFL algorithms based on the gradients of the clients,
providing firm evidence of the high efficiency of density-based clustering
methods when used to differentiate between the loss surfaces of neural networks
trained on different distributions. Moreover, by inspecting the feasibility of
local explanations generated with the help of GradCAM, we can provide more
insights into the relationship between personalisation and the explainability
of local predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模移动数据的复杂性导致模型训练困难，传统的位置预测忽视了距离和方向等隐式因素，影响预测效果。

Method: 采用熵勒驱动课程学习（基于Lempel-Ziv压缩算法评估轨迹可预测性）和多任务学习（同时优化位置预测、运动距离和方向估计）的统一框架。

Result: 在HuMob挑战赛中达到最高水平：GEO-BLEU(0.354)和DTW(26.15)指标，收敛速度提升2.92倍。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结构化训练过程和多维监督信号，有效提升了移动预测的性能和效率。

Abstract: The increasing availability of big mobility data from ubiquitous portable
devices enables human mobility prediction through deep learning approaches.
However, the diverse complexity of human mobility data impedes model training,
leading to inefficient gradient updates and potential underfitting. Meanwhile,
exclusively predicting next locations neglects implicit determinants, including
distances and directions, thereby yielding suboptimal prediction results. This
paper presents a unified training framework that integrates entropy-driven
curriculum and multi-task learning to address these challenges. The proposed
entropy-driven curriculum learning strategy quantifies trajectory
predictability based on Lempel-Ziv compression and organizes training from
simple to complex for faster convergence and enhanced performance. The
multi-task training simultaneously optimizes the primary location prediction
alongside auxiliary estimation of movement distance and direction for learning
realistic mobility patterns, and improve prediction accuracy through
complementary supervision signals. Extensive experiments conducted in
accordance with the HuMob Challenge demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on GEO-BLEU (0.354) and DTW (26.15) metrics with
up to 2.92-fold convergence speed compared to training without curriculum
learning.

TL;DR: 梯度因果发现方法容易受到数据分布偏差的影响，本文识别了两种偏差类型并提出了控制方法


<details>

Motivation: 梯度因果发现方法虽然高效可扩展，但对数据分布偏差敏感，需要研究其影响和解决方案

Method: 针对二元分类设置和Dirichlet先验，使用学习边际或条件分布的简单模型来分析偏差影响，并通过消除因果分解竞争来增强鲁棒性

Result: 证明了梯度因果发现方法对边际分布不对称性和边际分布偏移不对称性两种偏差敏感，但通过控制竞争可以使其对这些偏差具有鲁棒性

Conclusion: 梯度因果发现方法需要关注数据分布偏差问题，通过适当的设计可以增强其对分布偏差的鲁棒性

Abstract: Gradient-based causal discovery shows great potential for deducing causal
structure from data in an efficient and scalable way. Those approaches however
can be susceptible to distributional biases in the data they are trained on. We
identify two such biases: Marginal Distribution Asymmetry, where differences in
entropy skew causal learning toward certain factorizations, and Marginal
Distribution Shift Asymmetry, where repeated interventions cause faster shifts
in some variables than in others. For the bivariate categorical setup with
Dirichlet priors, we illustrate how these biases can occur even in controlled
synthetic data. To examine their impact on gradient-based methods, we employ
two simple models that derive causal factorizations by learning marginal or
conditional data distributions - a common strategy in gradient-based causal
discovery. We demonstrate how these models can be susceptible to both biases.
We additionally show how the biases can be controlled. An empirical evaluation
of two related, existing approaches indicates that eliminating competition
between possible causal factorizations can make models robust to the presented
biases.

TL;DR: L2C是一个通过元学习自适应调整ADMM-DDP超参数的框架，使用轻量级神经网络建模超参数，能够端到端分布式训练，在复杂协作任务中实现快速梯度计算和鲁棒适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式轨迹优化方法ADMM-DDP需要大量调参来平衡局部任务性能和全局协调，传统方法调参困难且耗时。

Method: 提出L2C框架，使用agent-wise神经网络元学习超参数，通过分布式方式端到端微分ADMM-DDP流程，重用DDP组件加速元梯度计算，并截断迭代和元学习ADMM惩罚参数。

Result: 在协作空中运输任务中，L2C能够生成动力学可行轨迹，重构四旋翼编队进行安全6自由度负载操作，适应不同团队规模和任务条件，梯度计算速度比现有方法快88%。

Conclusion: L2C提供了一个通用框架，能够自动适应不同任务和配置，显著提高了分布式轨迹优化的效率和性能。

Abstract: Distributed trajectory optimization via ADMM-DDP is a powerful approach for
coordinating multi-agent systems, but it requires extensive tuning of tightly
coupled hyperparameters that jointly govern local task performance and global
coordination. In this paper, we propose Learning to Coordinate (L2C), a general
framework that meta-learns these hyperparameters, modeled by lightweight
agent-wise neural networks, to adapt across diverse tasks and agent
configurations. L2C differentiates end-to-end through the ADMM-DDP pipeline in
a distributed manner. It also enables efficient meta-gradient computation by
reusing DDP components such as Riccati recursions and feedback gains. These
gradients correspond to the optimal solutions of distributed matrix-valued LQR
problems, coordinated across agents via an auxiliary ADMM framework that
becomes convex under mild assumptions. Training is further accelerated by
truncating iterations and meta-learning ADMM penalty parameters optimized for
rapid residual reduction, with provable Lipschitz-bounded gradient errors. On a
challenging cooperative aerial transport task, L2C generates dynamically
feasible trajectories in high-fidelity simulation using IsaacSIM, reconfigures
quadrotor formations for safe 6-DoF load manipulation in tight spaces, and
adapts robustly to varying team sizes and task conditions, while achieving up
to $88\%$ faster gradient computation than state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 生成建模的最新进展突显了强化学习在微调中的重要性，特别是KL正则化方法对自回归和扩散模型非常有效。RTB目标最近被引入用于改进序列生成模型的微调，但需要明确其在更广泛理论框架中的位置。

Method: 基于先前将GFlowNets与最大熵RL联系起来的工作，建立了RTB与具有KL正则化的离策略RL方法Trust-PCL之间的等价关系，并通过重新分析RTB论文中的示例进行验证。

Result: 证明了RTB与Trust-PCL的等价性，将RTB置于KL正则化RL的更广泛理论框架中，并显示KL正则化RL方法能够达到与RTB相当的性能表现。

Conclusion: 这项工作澄清了RTB与早期方法的关系，为序列生成模型的微调提供了替代视角，表明KL正则化RL方法是RTB的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Recent progress in generative modeling has highlighted the importance of
Reinforcement Learning (RL) for fine-tuning, with KL-regularized methods in
particular proving to be highly effective for both autoregressive and diffusion
models. Complementing this line of work, the Relative Trajectory Balance (RTB)
objective was recently introduced in the context of Generative Flow Networks
(GFlowNets) to serve the same role of improving fine-tuning in sequential
generative models. Building on prior work linking GFlowNets and maximum-entropy
RL, we establish in this paper an equivalence between RTB and Trust-PCL, an
off-policy RL method with KL regularization. This equivalence situates RTB
within the broader theoretical landscape of KL-regularized RL, and clarifies
its relationship to earlier methods. Leveraging this insight, we revisit an
illustrative example from the RTB paper and show that KL-regularized RL methods
achieve comparable performance, offering an alternative perspective to what was
previously reported.

Abstract: Task load detection is essential for optimizing human performance across
diverse applications, yet current models often lack generalizability beyond
narrow experimental domains. While prior research has focused on individual
tasks and limited modalities, there remains a gap in evaluating model
robustness and transferability in real-world scenarios. This paper addresses
these limitations by introducing a new multimodal dataset that extends
established cognitive load detection benchmarks with a real-world gaming
application, using the $n$-back test as a scientific foundation. Task load
annotations are derived from objective performance, subjective NASA-TLX
ratings, and task-level design, enabling a comprehensive evaluation framework.
State-of-the-art end-to-end model, including xLSTM, ConvNeXt, and Transformer
architectures are systematically trained and evaluated on multiple modalities
and application domains to assess their predictive performance and cross-domain
generalization. Results demonstrate that multimodal approaches consistently
outperform unimodal baselines, with specific modalities and model architectures
showing varying impact depending on the application subset. Importantly, models
trained on one domain exhibit reduced performance when transferred to novel
applications, underscoring remaining challenges for universal cognitive load
estimation. These findings provide robust baselines and actionable insights for
developing more generalizable cognitive load detection systems, advancing both
research and practical implementation in human-computer interaction and
adaptive systems.

Motivation: 蒸馏在大型语言模型预训练中重新受到关注（如Llama-3.2和Gemma模型系列），但其对现代LLM关键能力（如测试时扩展和上下文学习）的影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 研究蒸馏预训练对模型性能的影响，使用二元模型沙箱进行分析以隔离观察到的现象背后的主要因素。

Result: 1) 蒸馏预训练显著改善测试时扩展性能；2) 蒸馏损害上下文学习能力，特别是基于归纳头的学习；3) 通过沙箱分析揭示了这些现象的共同因素。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了蒸馏预训练的性能权衡，为实践者提供了关于预训练设计选择的见解，帮助在测试时扩展和上下文学习之间做出平衡决策。

Abstract: In the past year, distillation has seen a renewed prominence in large
language model (LLM) pretraining, exemplified by the Llama-3.2 and Gemma model
families. While distillation has historically been shown to improve statistical
modeling, its effects on new paradigms that are key to modern LLMs, such as
test-time scaling and in-context learning, remain underexplored. In this work,
we make three main contributions. First, we show that pretraining with
distillation yields models that exhibit remarkably better test-time scaling.
Second, we observe that this benefit comes with a trade-off: distillation
impairs in-context learning capabilities, particularly the one modeled via
induction heads. Third, to demystify these findings, we study distilled
pretraining in a sandbox of a bigram model, which helps us isolate the common
principal factor behind our observations. Finally, using these insights, we
shed light on various design choices for pretraining that should help
practitioners going forward.

Conclusion: 交叉条件调节的效果依赖于PDE方程的特性和物理机制，新方法在保持效率的同时显著提高了精度

Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a promising tool for accelerating the
solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). The Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets) represent a pioneering framework in this area: the "vanilla"
DeepONet is valued for its simplicity and efficiency, while the modified
DeepONet achieves higher accuracy at the cost of increased training time. In
this work, we propose a series of Transformer-inspired DeepONet variants that
introduce bidirectional cross-conditioning between the branch and trunk
networks in DeepONet. Query-point information is injected into the branch
network and input-function information into the trunk network, enabling dynamic
dependencies while preserving the simplicity and efficiency of the "vanilla"
DeepONet in a non-intrusive manner. Experiments on four PDE benchmarks --
advection, diffusion-reaction, Burgers', and Korteweg-de Vries equations --
show that for each case, there exists a variant that matches or surpasses the
accuracy of the modified DeepONet while offering improved training efficiency.
Moreover, the best-performing variant for each equation aligns naturally with
the equation's underlying characteristics, suggesting that the effectiveness of
cross-conditioning depends on the characteristics of the equation and its
underlying physics. To ensure robustness, we validate the effectiveness of our
variants through a range of rigorous statistical analyses, among them the
Wilcoxon Two One-Sided Test, Glass's Delta, and Spearman's rank correlation.

Abstract: Existing agents for solving tasks such as ML engineering rely on prompting
powerful language models. As a result, these agents do not improve with more
experience. In this paper, we show that agents backed by weaker models that
improve via reinforcement learning (RL) can outperform agents backed by much
larger, but static models. We identify two major challenges with RL in this
setting. First, actions can take a variable amount of time (e.g., executing
code for different solutions), which leads to asynchronous policy gradient
updates that favor faster but suboptimal solutions. To tackle variable-duration
actions, we propose duration- aware gradient updates in a distributed
asynchronous RL framework to amplify high-cost but high-reward actions. Second,
using only test split performance as a reward provides limited feedback. A
program that is nearly correct is treated the same as one that fails entirely.
To address this, we propose environment instrumentation to offer partial
credit, distinguishing almost-correct programs from those that fail early
(e.g., during data loading). Environment instrumentation uses a separate static
language model to insert print statement to an existing program to log the
agent's experimental progress, from which partial credit can be extracted as
reward signals for learning. Our experimental results on MLEBench suggest that
performing gradient updates on a much smaller model (Qwen2.5-3B) trained with
RL outperforms prompting a much larger model (Claude-3.5-Sonnet) with agent
scaffolds, by an average of 22% across 12 Kaggle tasks.

Abstract: Wear and tear detection in fleet and shared vehicle systems is a critical
challenge, particularly in rental and car-sharing services, where minor damage,
such as dents, scratches, and underbody impacts, often goes unnoticed or is
detected too late. Currently, manual inspection methods are the default
approach but are labour intensive and prone to human error. In contrast,
state-of-the-art image-based methods struggle with real-time performance and
are less effective at detecting underbody damage due to limited visual access
and poor spatial coverage. This work introduces a novel multi-modal
architecture based on anomaly detection to address these issues. Sensors such
as IMUs and microphones are integrated into a compact device mounted on the
vehicle's windshield. This approach supports real-time damage detection while
avoiding the need for highly resource-intensive sensors. We developed multiple
variants of multi-modal autoencoder-based architectures and evaluated them
against unimodal and state-of-the-art methods. Our ensemble pooling multi-modal
model achieved the highest performance, with a Receiver Operating
Characteristic-Area Under Curve (ROC-AUC) of 92%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in real-world applications. This approach can also be extended to
other applications, such as improving automotive safety - where it can
integrate with airbag systems for efficient deployment - and helping autonomous
vehicles by complementing other sensors in collision detection.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) using foundation models for policy approximations
in multi-turn tasks remains challenging. We identify two main limitations
related to sparse reward settings and policy gradient updates, based on which
we formulate a key insight: updates from positive samples with high returns
typically do not require policy regularisation, whereas updates from negative
samples, reflecting undesirable behaviour, can harm model performance. This
paper introduces Succeed or Learn Slowly (SoLS), a novel off-policy RL
algorithm evaluated on mobile app control tasks. SoLS improves sample
efficiency when fine-tuning foundation models for user interface navigation via
a modified off-policy actor-critic approach, applying direct policy updates for
positive samples and conservative, regularised updates for negative ones to
prevent model degradation. We augment SoLS with Successful Transition Replay
(STR), which prioritises learning from successful interactions, further
improving sample efficiency. We evaluate SoLS on the AndroidWorld benchmark,
where it significantly outperforms existing methods (at least 17% relative
increase), including prompt-engineering and RL approaches, while requiring
substantially fewer computational resources than GPT-4o-based methods with
5-60x faster inference.

Abstract: EEG recordings contain rich information about neural activity but are subject
to artifacts, noise, and superficial differences due to sensors, amplifiers,

Convolutional Monge Mapping Normalization (CMMN) is a recent tool used to

the source subject with the closest spectrum to the target subject. Notably,
our extension yields space-time separable filters that can be used to map
between datasets with different numbers of EEG channels. We apply these filters
in an IC classification task, and show significant improvement in recognizing
brain versus non-brain ICs.
  Clinical relevance - EEG recordings are used in the diagnosis and monitoring
of multiple neuropathologies, including epilepsy and psychosis. While EEG
analysis can benefit from automating artifact removal through independent
component analysis and labeling, differences in recording equipment and context
(the presence of noise from electrical wiring and other devices) may impact the
performance of machine learning models, but these differences can be minimized
by appropriate spectral normalization through filtering.

TL;DR: 提出BM-CL框架，将偏差缓解重新定义为持续学习问题，通过借鉴持续学习技术来改善弱势群体结果同时保持优势群体性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统偏差缓解技术存在"拉平效应"，改善弱势群体结果往往以牺牲优势群体性能为代价，需要新的方法来平衡公平性和有效性

Method: 基于持续学习原理，借鉴Learning without Forgetting和Elastic Weight Consolidation技术，将偏差缓解视为领域增量持续学习问题，使模型能够适应变化的公平条件

Result: 在合成和真实图像数据集上的实验表明，该框架能够有效缓解偏差，同时最小化原始知识的损失

Conclusion: BM-CL框架连接了公平性和持续学习领域，为开发既公平又有效的机器学习系统提供了有前景的途径

Abstract: Biases in machine learning pose significant challenges, particularly when
models amplify disparities that affect disadvantaged groups. Traditional bias
mitigation techniques often lead to a {\itshape leveling-down effect}, whereby
improving outcomes of disadvantaged groups comes at the expense of reduced
performance for advantaged groups. This study introduces Bias Mitigation
through Continual Learning (BM-CL), a novel framework that leverages the
principles of continual learning to address this trade-off. We postulate that
mitigating bias is conceptually similar to domain-incremental continual
learning, where the model must adjust to changing fairness conditions,
improving outcomes for disadvantaged groups without forgetting the knowledge
that benefits advantaged groups. Drawing inspiration from techniques such as
Learning without Forgetting and Elastic Weight Consolidation, we reinterpret
bias mitigation as a continual learning problem. This perspective allows models
to incrementally balance fairness objectives, enhancing outcomes for
disadvantaged groups while preserving performance for advantaged groups.
Experiments on synthetic and real-world image datasets, characterized by
diverse sources of bias, demonstrate that the proposed framework mitigates
biases while minimizing the loss of original knowledge. Our approach bridges
the fields of fairness and continual learning, offering a promising pathway for
developing machine learning systems that are both equitable and effective.

Conclusion: 提出的高效联邦LLM蒸馏方案成功解决了大语言模型在联邦学习中的高通信开销问题，同时保持了良好的模型性能

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) for large language models (LLMs) offers a
privacy-preserving scheme, enabling clients to collaboratively fine-tune
locally deployed LLMs or smaller language models (SLMs) without exchanging raw
data. While parameter-sharing methods in traditional FL models solves number of
technical challenges, they still incur high communication overhead and struggle
with adapting to heterogeneous model architectures. Federated distillation, a
framework for mutual knowledge transfer via shared logits, typically offers
lower communication overhead than parameter-sharing methods. However,
transmitting logits from LLMs remains challenging for bandwidth-limited clients
due to their high dimensionality. In this work, we focus on a federated LLM
distillation with efficient communication overhead. To achieve this, we first
propose an adaptive Top-k logit selection mechanism, dynamically sparsifying
logits according to real-time communication conditions. Then to tackle the
dimensional inconsistency introduced by the adaptive sparsification, we design
an adaptive logits aggregation scheme, effectively alleviating the artificial
and uninformative inputs introduced by conventional zero-padding methods.
Finally, to enhance the distillation effect, we incorporate LoRA-adapted
hidden-layer projection from LLM into the distillation loss, reducing the
communication overhead further while providing richer representation.
Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme achieves superior performance
compared to baseline methods while effectively reducing communication overhead
by approximately 50%.

Motivation: 当前强化学习基准测试主要关注确定性或简化设置，缺乏对真实世界随机性和部分可观测性的系统评估，阻碍了RL方法在现实场景中的应用

Method: 提出STORI基准测试，包含多样化的随机效应；建立RL环境中随机性的分类学框架，为系统评估提供统一标准

Result: 创建了一个能够严格评估RL方法在不同不确定性形式下表现的基准测试平台

Conclusion: STORI基准和随机性分类学填补了现有评估体系的空白，为RL方法在真实随机环境中的鲁棒性研究提供了重要工具

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents have achieved strong results on benchmarks
such as Atari100k, yet they remain limited in robustness to real-world
conditions. Model-Based RL approaches that rely on learned World Models often
struggle in environments with true stochasticity and partial observability,
despite their theoretical grounding in POMDPs. Current benchmarks rarely
capture these challenges, focusing instead on deterministic or overly
simplified settings, and the lack of a clear taxonomy of stochasticity further
hampers systematic evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce STORI
(STOchastic-ataRI), a benchmark that incorporates diverse stochastic effects
and enables rigorous assessment of RL methods under varied forms of
uncertainty. In addition, we propose a taxonomy of stochasticity in RL
environments, providing a unified framework for analyzing and comparing
approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了MBT-CB模型，一种基于BERT的多目标贝叶斯Transformer，用于从电子健康记录中联合预测CVD生物标志物（LDL-C、HbA1c、BMI、SysBP），在COVID-19疫情期间表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID-19大流行严重影响了心血管疾病患者的医疗护理，导致关键生物标志物变化。现有方法未能同时处理多目标预测、生物标志物相互依赖性、时间模式和预测不确定性。

Method: 使用预训练的BERT-based transformer框架，结合贝叶斯变分推理估计不确定性，通过嵌入捕获时间关系，DeepMTR模型捕获生物标志物相互关系。

Result: 在3,390条CVD患者记录上评估，MBT-CB在MAE(0.00887)、RMSE(0.0135)和MSE(0.00027)指标上优于其他基线模型，有效捕获了数据不确定性、模型不确定性和时间动态。

Conclusion: MBT-CB的优异性能表明其在改善CVD生物标志物预测和支持临床决策方面具有巨大潜力，特别是在大流行等特殊时期。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthcare systems worldwide,
disproportionately impacting individuals with chronic conditions such as
cardiovascular disease (CVD). These disruptions -- through delayed care and
behavioral changes, affected key CVD biomarkers, including LDL cholesterol
(LDL-C), HbA1c, BMI, and systolic blood pressure (SysBP). Accurate modeling of
these changes is crucial for predicting disease progression and guiding
preventive care. However, prior work has not addressed multi-target prediction
of CVD biomarker from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using machine learning
(ML), while jointly capturing biomarker interdependencies, temporal patterns,
and predictive uncertainty. In this paper, we propose MBT-CB, a Multi-target
Bayesian Transformer (MBT) with pre-trained BERT-based transformer framework to
jointly predict LDL-C, HbA1c, BMI and SysBP CVD biomarkers from EHR data. The
model leverages Bayesian Variational Inference to estimate uncertainties,
embeddings to capture temporal relationships and a DeepMTR model to capture
biomarker inter-relationships. We evaluate MBT-CT on retrospective EHR data
from 3,390 CVD patient records (304 unique patients) in Central Massachusetts
during the Covid-19 pandemic. MBT-CB outperformed a comprehensive set of
baselines including other BERT-based ML models, achieving an MAE of 0.00887,
RMSE of 0.0135 and MSE of 0.00027, while effectively capturing data and model
uncertainty, patient biomarker inter-relationships, and temporal dynamics via
its attention and embedding mechanisms. MBT-CB's superior performance
highlights its potential to improve CVD biomarker prediction and support
clinical decision-making during pandemics.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked growing
interest in their application to time series analysis tasks. However, their
ability to perform complex reasoning over temporal data in real-world
application domains remains underexplored. To move toward this goal, a first
step is to establish a rigorous benchmark dataset for evaluation. In this work,
we introduce the TSAIA Benchmark, a first attempt to evaluate LLMs as
time-series AI assistants. To ensure both scientific rigor and practical
relevance, we surveyed over 20 academic publications and identified 33
real-world task formulations. The benchmark encompasses a broad spectrum of
challenges, ranging from constraint-aware forecasting to anomaly detection with
threshold calibration: tasks that require compositional reasoning and
multi-step time series analysis. The question generator is designed to be
dynamic and extensible, supporting continuous expansion as new datasets or task
types are introduced. Given the heterogeneous nature of the tasks, we adopt
task-specific success criteria and tailored inference-quality metrics to ensure
meaningful evaluation for each task. We apply this benchmark to assess eight
state-of-the-art LLMs under a unified evaluation protocol. Our analysis reveals
limitations in current models' ability to assemble complex time series analysis
workflows, underscoring the need for specialized methodologies for
domain-specific adaptation. Our benchmark is available at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/Melady/TSAIA, and the code is available at

Abstract: Routing vessels through narrow and dynamic waterways is challenging due to
changing environmental conditions and operational constraints. Existing
vessel-routing studies typically fail to generalize across multiple
origin-destination pairs and do not exploit large-scale, data-driven traffic
graphs. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning solution for big
maritime data that can learn to find a route across multiple origin-destination
pairs while adapting to different hexagonal grid resolutions. Agents learn to
select direction and speed under continuous observations in a multi-discrete
action space. A reward function balances fuel efficiency, travel time, wind
resistance, and route diversity, using an Automatic Identification System
(AIS)-derived traffic graph with ERA5 wind fields. The approach is demonstrated
in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, one of the largest estuaries in the world. We
evaluate configurations that combine Proximal Policy Optimization with
recurrent networks, invalid-action masking, and exploration strategies. Our
experiments demonstrate that action masking yields a clear improvement in
policy performance and that supplementing penalty-only feedback with positive
shaping rewards produces additional gains.

Motivation: 现有保形预测方法面临数据效率低或计算复杂度高的问题，需要一种既能保持覆盖保证又高效的方法。

Method: 使用排列不变的Transformer-based ICL模型，配合CP感知损失训练，模拟FCP的多重重新训练需求。

Result: 在合成和真实任务上实验显示，E-ICL+FCP在效率-覆盖权衡方面优于现有SCP和FCP基线方法。

Conclusion: E-ICL+FCP框架有效解决了保形预测中的数据效率和计算复杂度问题，为可靠的不确定性量化提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is critical for trustworthy AI. Conformal
Prediction (CP) provides prediction sets with distribution-free coverage
guarantees, but its two main variants face complementary limitations. Split CP
(SCP) suffers from data inefficiency due to dataset partitioning, while full CP
(FCP) improves data efficiency at the cost of prohibitive retraining
complexity. Recent approaches based on meta-learning or in-context learning
(ICL) partially mitigate these drawbacks. However, they rely on training
procedures not specifically tailored to CP, which may yield large prediction
sets. We introduce an efficient FCP framework, termed enhanced ICL-based FCP
(E-ICL+FCP), which employs a permutation-invariant Transformer-based ICL model
trained with a CP-aware loss. By simulating the multiple retrained models
required by FCP without actual retraining, E-ICL+FCP preserves coverage while
markedly reducing both inefficiency and computational overhead. Experiments on
synthetic and real tasks demonstrate that E-ICL+FCP attains superior
efficiency-coverage trade-offs compared to existing SCP and FCP baselines.

TL;DR: GradES是一种基于梯度的早期停止方法，通过监控transformer组件中投影矩阵的梯度大小，在梯度低于收敛阈值时单独停止该矩阵的更新，从而加速训练并提高泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统早期停止方法需要监控全局验证损失并同时停止所有参数更新，对于大型transformer来说计算成本高昂，因为验证推理需要大量时间。

Method: 在transformer组件（注意力投影和前馈层矩阵）中跟踪反向传播期间的梯度大小。当投影矩阵的梯度低于收敛阈值τ时，单独排除该投影矩阵的进一步更新，允许收敛慢的矩阵继续学习。

Result: GradES将训练时间加速1.57-7.22倍，同时通过早期防止过拟合提高泛化能力，平均准确率提高1.2%。

Conclusion: GradES提供了一种计算高效的早期停止方法，通过组件级别的梯度监控实现了训练加速和性能提升的双重好处。

Abstract: Early stopping monitors global validation loss and halts all parameter
updates simultaneously, which is computationally costly for large transformers
due to the extended time required for validation inference. We propose GradES,
a novel gradient-based early stopping approach that operates within transformer
components (attention projections and Feed-Forward layer matrices). We found
that different components converge at varying rates during fine-tuning. GradES
tracks the magnitude of gradients in backpropagation for these matrices during
training. When a projection matrix's gradients fall below a convergence
threshold $\tau$, we exclude that projection matrix from further updates
individually, eliminating costly validation passes while allowing slow
converging matrices to continue learning. By strategically freezing parameters
when their gradients converge, GradES speeds up training time by
1.57--7.22$\times$ while simultaneously enhancing generalization through early
prevention of overfitting, resulting in 1.2% higher average accuracy.

Abstract: Understanding the inner workings of machine learning models is critical for
ensuring their reliability and robustness. Whilst many techniques in
mechanistic interpretability focus on activation driven analyses, being able to
derive meaningful features directly from the weights of a neural network would
provide greater guarantees and more computational efficiency. Existing
techniques for analyzing model features through weights suffer from drawbacks
such as reduced performance and data inefficiency. In this paper, we introduce
Signed Quadratic Shrink (SQS), an activation function designed to allow Gated
Linear Units (GLUs) to learn interpretable features without these drawbacks.
Our experimental results show that SQS achieves performance competitive with

Abstract: This paper develops a semi-on-demand transit feeder service using shared
autonomous vehicles (SAVs) and zonal dispatching control based on reinforcement
learning (RL). This service combines the cost-effectiveness of fixed-route
transit with the adaptability of demand-responsive transport to improve
accessibility in lower-density areas. Departing from the terminus, SAVs first
make scheduled fixed stops, then offer on-demand pick-ups and drop-offs in a
pre-determined flexible-route area. Our deep RL model dynamically assigns
vehicles to subdivided flexible-route zones in response to real-time demand
fluctuations and operations, using a policy gradient algorithm - Proximal
Policy Optimization. The methodology is demonstrated through agent-based
simulations on a real-world bus route in Munich, Germany. Results show that
after efficient training of the RL model, the semi-on-demand service with
dynamic zonal control serves 16% more passengers at 13% higher generalized
costs on average compared to traditional fixed-route service. The efficiency
gain brought by RL control brings 2.4% more passengers at 1.4% higher costs.
This study not only showcases the potential of integrating SAV feeders and
machine learning techniques into public transit, but also sets the groundwork
for further innovations in addressing first-mile-last-mile problems in
multimodal transit systems.

Abstract: Rapid post-disaster road damage assessment is critical for effective
emergency response, yet traditional optimization methods suffer from excessive
computational time and require domain knowledge for algorithm design, making
them unsuitable for time-sensitive disaster scenarios. This study proposes an
attention-based encoder-decoder model (AEDM) for real-time drone routing
decision in post-disaster road damage assessment. The method employs deep
reinforcement learning to determine high-quality drone assessment routes
without requiring algorithmic design knowledge. A network transformation method
is developed to convert link-based routing problems into equivalent node-based
formulations, while a synthetic road network generation technique addresses the
scarcity of large-scale training datasets. The model is trained using policy
optimization with multiple optima (POMO) with multi-task learning capabilities
to handle diverse parameter combinations. Experimental results demonstrate two
key strengths of AEDM: it outperforms commercial solvers by 16--69\% in
solution quality and achieves real-time inference (1--2 seconds) versus
100--2,000 seconds for traditional methods. The model exhibits strong
generalization across varying problem scales, drone numbers, and time
constraints, consistently outperforming baseline methods on unseen parameter
distributions and real-world road networks. The proposed method effectively
balances computational efficiency with solution quality, making it particularly
suitable for time-critical disaster response applications where rapid
decision-making is essential for saving lives.

Result: 车辆基本特征（车重和车型年份）贡献了超过55%的特征重要性，但ADAS功能也有有意义的预测贡献。优化后的随机森林模型在测试集上达到89.18%准确率和0.9586 ROC AUC。

Conclusion: 机器学习能有效分析大规模NCAP数据，传统车辆参数和现代ADAS功能的结合对获得顶级安全评级具有重要预测价值。

Abstract: Vehicle safety assessment is crucial for consumer information and regulatory
oversight. The New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) assigns standardized safety
ratings, which traditionally emphasize passive safety measures but now include
active safety technologies such as Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS).
It is crucial to understand how these various systems interact empirically.
This study explores whether particular ADAS features like Forward Collision
Warning, Lane Departure Warning, Crash Imminent Braking, and Blind Spot
Detection, together with established vehicle attributes (e.g., Curb Weight,
Model Year, Vehicle Type, Drive Train), can reliably predict a vehicle's
likelihood of earning the highest (5-star) overall NCAP rating. Using a
publicly available dataset derived from NCAP reports that contain approximately
5,128 vehicle variants spanning model years 2011-2025, we compared four
different machine learning models: logistic regression, random forest, gradient
boosting, and support vector classifier (SVC) using a 5-fold stratified
cross-validation approach. The two best-performing algorithms (random forest
and gradient boost) were hyperparameter optimized using RandomizedSearchCV.
Analysis of feature importance showed that basic vehicle characteristics,
specifically curb weight and model year, dominated predictive capability,
contributing more than 55% of the feature relevance of the Random Forest model.
However, the inclusion of ADAS features also provided meaningful predictive
contributions. The optimized Random Forest model achieved robust results on a
held-out test set, with an accuracy of 89.18% and a ROC AUC of 0.9586. This
research reveals the use of machine learning to analyze large-scale NCAP data
and highlights the combined predictive importance of both established vehicle
parameters and modern ADAS features to achieve top safety ratings.

TL;DR: VISP是一种基于梯度波动性的自适应正则化方法，通过动态计算梯度统计量来调整随机投影矩阵，选择性地对高波动性节点进行正则化，在多个数据集上显著提升泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正则化方法使用均匀噪声或固定dropout率，无法根据网络内部动态调整正则化强度。VISP旨在利用梯度波动性信息来实现更智能的自适应正则化。

Method: VISP动态计算梯度统计量的波动性，并用其缩放随机投影矩阵。该方法选择性地对表现出较高梯度波动性的输入和隐藏节点进行正则化，同时保持稳定表示。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和SVHN数据集上的实验表明，VISP相比基线模型和固定噪声方法持续改善泛化性能。分析显示VISP能稳定网络内部动态并促进更鲁棒的特征表示。

Conclusion: VISP通过梯度波动性指导的自适应噪声注入，提供了一种有效的正则化方法，能够显著提升深度神经网络的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We propose VISP: Volatility Informed Stochastic Projection, an adaptive
regularization method that leverages gradient volatility to guide stochastic
noise injection in deep neural networks. Unlike conventional techniques that
apply uniform noise or fixed dropout rates, VISP dynamically computes
volatility from gradient statistics and uses it to scale a stochastic
projection matrix. This mechanism selectively regularizes inputs and hidden
nodes that exhibit higher gradient volatility while preserving stable
representations, thereby mitigating overfitting. Extensive experiments on
MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that VISP consistently improves
generalization performance over baseline models and fixed-noise alternatives.
In addition, detailed analyses of the evolution of volatility, the spectral
properties of the projection matrix, and activation distributions reveal that
VISP not only stabilizes the internal dynamics of the network but also fosters
a more robust feature representation.

problem from the perspective of i.i.d. data. Here, we develop a framework,
GraCE-VAE, for non-i.i.d. settings, in which structured context in the form of
network data is available. GraCE-VAE integrates discrepancy-based variational
autoencoders with graph neural networks to jointly recover the true latent
causal graph and intervention effects. We show that the theoretical results of
identifiability from i.i.d. data hold in our setup. We also empirically
evaluate GraCE-VAE against state-of-the-art baselines on three genetic
perturbation datasets to demonstrate the impact of leveraging structured
context for causal disentanglement.

*Zhao Wei,Chin Chun Ooi,Yew-Soon Ong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应Co-Kriging辅助的多保真度多目标神经架构搜索算法，通过聚类局部采样策略和连续编码方法，显著降低了计算成本并提升了搜索效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经架构搜索(NAS)虽然能自动优化架构设计，但计算成本高昂，特别是在多目标优化场景下。需要一种更高效的方法来减少计算负担。

Method: 采用自适应Co-Kriging辅助的多保真度多目标NAS算法，结合聚类局部采样策略和新型连续编码方法，降低搜索维度并加速收敛。

Result: 在有限计算预算下，该算法在三个数值基准、2D Darcy流回归问题和CHASE_DB1医学图像分割问题上优于现有最先进方法，并在城市建模的风速回归应用中表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅显著降低了NAS的计算成本，还独立发现了U-Net架构的优化原则，证明了其有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is an attractive approach to automate the
design of optimized architectures but is constrained by high computational
budget, especially when optimizing for multiple, important conflicting
objectives. To address this, an adaptive Co-Kriging-assisted multi-fidelity
multi-objective NAS algorithm is proposed to further reduce the computational
cost of NAS by incorporating a clustering-based local multi-fidelity infill
sampling strategy, enabling efficient exploration of the search space for
faster convergence. This algorithm is further accelerated by the use of a novel
continuous encoding method to represent the connections of nodes in each cell
within a generalized cell-based U-Net backbone, thereby decreasing the search
dimension (number of variables). Results indicate that the proposed NAS
algorithm outperforms previously published state-of-the-art methods under
limited computational budget on three numerical benchmarks, a 2D Darcy flow
regression problem and a CHASE_DB1 biomedical image segmentation problem. The
proposed method is subsequently used to create a wind velocity regression model
with application in urban modelling, with the found model able to achieve good
prediction with less computational complexity. Further analysis revealed that
the NAS algorithm independently identified principles undergirding superior
U-Net architectures in other literature, such as the importance of allowing
each cell to incorporate information from prior cells.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过程模型具有物理真实性但计算成本高且结构僵化，机器学习方法高效灵活但缺乏可解释性和可迁移性，需要结合两者优势

Method: 三阶段框架：行为蒸馏（通过代理学习简化过程模型）、结构蒸馏（将过程方程重构为图神经网络模块）、认知蒸馏（嵌入专家推理和自适应决策）

Result: 在Samish流域的演示表明，该框架能够重现过程模型输出、提高预测准确性并支持基于情景的决策

Conclusion: 该框架为下一代智能生态水文建模系统提供了可扩展和可迁移的途径，并具有扩展到其他基于过程领域的潜力

Abstract: Simulating ecohydrological processes is essential for understanding complex
environmental systems and guiding sustainable management amid accelerating
climate change and human pressures. Process-based models provide physical
realism but can suffer from structural rigidity, high computational costs, and
complex calibration, while machine learning (ML) methods are efficient and
flexible yet often lack interpretability and transferability. We propose a
unified three-phase framework that integrates process-based models with ML and
progressively embeds them into artificial intelligence (AI) through knowledge
distillation. Phase I, behavioral distillation, enhances process models via
surrogate learning and model simplification to capture key dynamics at lower
computational cost. Phase II, structural distillation, reformulates process
equations as modular components within a graph neural network (GNN), enabling
multiscale representation and seamless integration with ML models. Phase III,
cognitive distillation, embeds expert reasoning and adaptive decision-making
into intelligent modeling agents using the Eyes-Brain-Hands-Mouth architecture.
Demonstrations for the Samish watershed highlight the framework's applicability
to ecohydrological modeling, showing that it can reproduce process-based model
outputs, improve predictive accuracy, and support scenario-based
decision-making. The framework offers a scalable and transferable pathway
toward next-generation intelligent ecohydrological modeling systems, with the
potential extension to other process-based domains.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了预测编码模型在新皮层中的情景记忆能力，发现模型只能在少量样本上训练时回忆具体细节，但会过拟合且泛化能力差，说明情景记忆可以从语义学习中产生，但数量有限，需要海马体的稀疏模式分离表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互补学习系统理论认为智能体需要两个学习系统（语义记忆和情景记忆），但预测编码模型挑战了这一二元性，展示了新皮层具有海马体类似的能力。本文旨在探索新皮层的预测编码模型的情景记忆能力及其与语义记忆的关系。

Method: 构建了一个新皮层的预测编码模型，通过在不同数量训练样本上测试其回忆具体细节的能力，分析模型的过拟合和泛化性能。

Result: 预测编码模型确实能够回忆个体样本的具体细节，但仅限于在少量样本上训练时。模型会对这些样本过拟合，泛化能力差。当训练样本数量增加时，模型失去回忆能力。

Conclusion: 个体样本可以逐渐在新皮层中使用密集、重叠的表示进行编码，但数量有限，这证明了需要海马体中发现的稀疏、模式分离的表示，支持互补学习系统理论。

Abstract: Complementary Learning Systems theory holds that intelligent agents need two
learning systems. Semantic memory is encoded in the neocortex with dense,
overlapping representations and acquires structured knowledge. Episodic memory
is encoded in the hippocampus with sparse, pattern-separated representations
and quickly learns the specifics of individual experiences. Recently, this
duality between semantic and episodic memories has been challenged by
predictive coding, a biologically plausible neural network model of the
neocortex which was shown to have hippocampus-like abilities on
auto-associative memory tasks. These results raise the question of the episodic
capabilities of the neocortex and their relation to semantic memory. In this
paper, we present such a predictive coding model of the neocortex and explore
its episodic capabilities. We show that this kind of model can indeed recall
the specifics of individual examples but only if it is trained on a small
number of examples. The model is overfitted to these exemples and does not
generalize well, suggesting that episodic memory can arise from semantic
learning. Indeed, a model trained with many more examples loses its recall
capabilities. This work suggests that individual examples can be encoded
gradually in the neocortex using dense, overlapping representations but only in
a limited number, motivating the need for sparse, pattern-separated
representations as found in the hippocampus.

Abstract: Logistical demand-supply forecasting that evaluates the alignment between
projected supply and anticipated demand, is essential for the efficiency and
quality of on-demand food delivery platforms and serves as a key indicator for
scheduling decisions. Future order distribution information, which reflects the
distribution of orders in on-demand food delivery, is crucial for the
performance of logistical demand-supply forecasting. Current studies utilize
spatial-temporal analysis methods to model future order distribution
information from serious time slices. However, learning future order
distribution in online delivery platform is a time-series-insensitive problem
with strong randomness. These approaches often struggle to effectively capture
this information while remaining efficient. This paper proposes an innovative
spatiotemporal learning model that utilizes only two graphs (ongoing and
global) to learn future order distribution information, achieving superior
performance compared to traditional spatial-temporal long-series methods. The
main contributions are as follows: (1) The introduction of ongoing and global
graphs in logistical demand-supply pressure forecasting compared to traditional
long time series significantly enhances forecasting performance. (2) An
innovative graph learning network framework using adaptive future graph
learning and innovative cross attention mechanism (ACA-Net) is proposed to
extract future order distribution information, effectively learning a robust
future graph that substantially improves logistical demand-supply pressure
forecasting outcomes. (3) The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated
in real-world production environments.

Result: 通过数值模拟验证了该算法在多模态分布上的有效性，证明了其加速收敛的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的PT-BPS算法能够有效加速多模态后验分布的采样收敛，相比传统方法具有更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Bayesian inference is useful to obtain a predictive distribution with a small
generalization error. However, since posterior distributions are rarely
evaluated analytically, we employ the variational Bayesian inference or
sampling method to approximate posterior distributions. When we obtain samples
from a posterior distribution, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) has been widely
used for the continuous variable part and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for
the discrete variable part. Another sampling method, the bouncy particle
sampler (BPS), has been proposed, which combines uniform linear motion and
stochastic reflection to perform sampling. BPS was reported to have the
advantage of being easier to set simulation parameters than HMC. To accelerate
the convergence to a posterior distribution, we introduced parallel tempering
(PT) to BPS, and then proposed an algorithm when the inverse temperature
exchange rate is set to infinity. We performed numerical simulations and
demonstrated its effectiveness for multimodal distribution.

Abstract: Processing data that lies on multiple interacting (product) graphs is
increasingly important in practical applications, yet existing methods are
mostly restricted to discrete graph filtering. Tensorial partial differential
equations on graphs (TPDEGs) offer a principled framework for modeling such
multidomain data in a continuous setting. However, current continuous
approaches are limited to first-order derivatives, which tend to dampen
high-frequency signals and slow down information propagation. This makes these
TPDEGs-based approaches less effective for capturing complex, multi-scale, and
heterophilic structures. In this paper, we introduce second-order TPDEGs
(So-TPDEGs) and propose the first theoretically grounded framework for
second-order continuous product graph neural networks. Our approach leverages
the separability of cosine kernels in Cartesian product graphs to implement
efficient spectral decomposition, while naturally preserving high-frequency
information. We provide rigorous theoretical analyses of stability under graph
perturbations and over-smoothing behavior regarding spectral properties. Our
theoretical results establish a robust foundation for advancing continuous
graph learning across multiple practical domains.

Motivation: 传统遗传编程演化的医疗预约规则缺乏维度一致性，导致规则难以被终端用户理解和信任，需要一种能够保持维度一致性的演化方法。

Abstract: Appointment scheduling is a great challenge in healthcare operations
management. Appointment rules (AR) provide medical practitioners with a simple
yet effective tool to determine patient appointment times. Genetic programming
(GP) can be used to evolve ARs. However, directly applying GP to design ARs may
lead to rules that are difficult for end-users to interpret and trust. A key
reason is that GP is unaware of the dimensional consistency, which ensures that
the evolved rules align with users' domain knowledge and intuitive
understanding. In this paper, we develop a new dimensionally aware GP algorithm
with dimension repair to evolve ARs with dimensional consistency and high
performance. A key innovation of our method is the dimension repair procedure,
which optimizes the dimensional consistency of an expression tree while
minimizing structural changes and ensuring that its output dimension meets the
problem's requirements. We formulate the task as a mixed-integer linear
programming model that can be efficiently solved using common mathematical
programming methods. With the support of the dimension repair procedure, our
method can explore a wider range of AR structures by temporarily breaking the
dimensional consistency of individuals, and then restoring it without altering
their overall structure, thereby identifying individuals with greater potential
advantages. We evaluated the proposed method in a comprehensive set of
simulated clinics. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach
managed to evolve high-quality ARs that significantly outperform not only the
manually designed ARs but also existing state-of-the-art dimensionally aware GP
methods in terms of both objective values and dimensional consistency. In
addition, we analyzed the semantics of the evolved ARs, providing insight into
the design of more effective and interpretable ARs.

### [601] [Fantastic Pretraining Optimizers and Where to Find Them](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02046)
*Kaiyue Wen,David Hall,Tengyu Ma,Percy Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过系统性研究发现，多数优化器超过AdamW的速度提升实际上比声称的小，且随模型规模增大而减少，从0.1B参数模型的1.4倍降至1.2B参数模型的1.1倍。误导性比较的主要原因是超参数调优不公平和评估方法有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然有许多声称能提供1.4到2倍速度提升的替代优化器，但AdamW仍在语言模型预训练中占主导地位。研究者认为两个方法论问题：(i)不公平的超参数调优和(ii)有限或误导的评估方案，导致了不公平的比较并阻碍实际采用。

Method: 对十种深度学习优化器进行系统性研究，涵盖四个模型规模（0.1B-1.2B参数）和数据-模型比例（1-8倍Chinchilla最优值）。重点关注严格的超参数调优和在训练结束时进行评估。

Result: 发现：(1)不同优化器的最优超参数差异较大，盲目转移超参数会导致不公平比较；(2)实际速度提升比声称的低，且随模型规模增大而降低，1.2B参数模型仅有1.1倍；(3)训练过程中的中间检查点比较可能误导，因为优化器排名可能在学习率衰减过程中发生反转。

Conclusion: 矩阵基优化器（如Muon和Soap）虽然表现最佳，但其速度提升与模型规模成反比，随模型增大而减少。这意味着对于大规模模型，替代优化器的实际价值可能较低。超参数调优的公平性和评估方案的完整性对于进行意义深远的优化器比较至关重要。

Abstract: AdamW has long been the dominant optimizer in language model pretraining,
despite numerous claims that alternative optimizers offer 1.4 to 2x speedup. We
posit that two methodological shortcomings have obscured fair comparisons and
hindered practical adoption: (i) unequal hyperparameter tuning and (ii) limited
or misleading evaluation setups. To address these two issues, we conduct a
systematic study of ten deep learning optimizers across four model scales
(0.1B-1.2B parameters) and data-to-model ratios (1-8x the Chinchilla optimum).
We find that fair and informative comparisons require rigorous hyperparameter
tuning and evaluations across a range of model scales and data-to-model ratios,
performed at the end of training. First, optimal hyperparameters for one
optimizer may be suboptimal for another, making blind hyperparameter transfer
unfair. Second, the actual speedup of many proposed optimizers over well-tuned
baselines is lower than claimed and decreases with model size to only 1.1x for
1.2B parameter models. Thirdly, comparing intermediate checkpoints before
reaching the target training budgets can be misleading, as rankings between two
optimizers can flip during training due to learning rate decay. Through our
thorough investigation, we find that all the fastest optimizers such as Muon
and Soap, use matrices as preconditioners -- multiplying gradients with
matrices rather than entry-wise scalars. However, the speedup of matrix-based
optimizers is inversely proportional to model scale, decreasing from 1.4x over
AdamW for 0.1B parameter models to merely 1.1x for 1.2B parameter models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的双层优化框架，通过在数据流形上使用局部外曲率作为隐私脆弱性度量，实现隐私保护与数据效用的协同平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型训练需要数据集，但直接共享原始数据存在成员推理攻击等隐私风险。现有隐私保护技术往往降低数据准确性、特异性和多样性，影响下游任务性能，因此在隐私保护和数据效用之间找到最优平衡是关键挑战

Method: 采用双层优化框架：上层任务关注数据效用，通过判别器指导生成过程确保扰动后的潜在变量映射到高质量样本；下层任务关注数据隐私，使用数据流形上的局部外曲率作为个体对成员推理攻击脆弱性的量化度量，通过向低曲率区域扰动样本来抑制易受攻击的独特特征组合

Result: 广泛的实验评估表明，该方法不仅增强了下游任务对成员推理攻击的抵抗能力，而且在样本质量和多样性方面超越了现有方法

Conclusion: 该双层优化框架通过交替优化隐私和效用目标，实现了隐私保护与数据效用的协同平衡，为解决隐私保护数据发布问题提供了有效的几何基础和方法论

Abstract: Machine learning models require datasets for effective training, but directly
sharing raw data poses significant privacy risk such as membership inference
attacks (MIA). To mitigate the risk, privacy-preserving techniques such as data
perturbation, generalization, and synthetic data generation are commonly
utilized. However, these methods often degrade data accuracy, specificity, and
diversity, limiting the performance of downstream tasks and thus reducing data
utility. Therefore, striking an optimal balance between privacy preservation
and data utility remains a critical challenge.
  To address this issue, we introduce a novel bilevel optimization framework
for the publication of private datasets, where the upper-level task focuses on
data utility and the lower-level task focuses on data privacy. In the
upper-level task, a discriminator guides the generation process to ensure that
perturbed latent variables are mapped to high-quality samples, maintaining
fidelity for downstream tasks. In the lower-level task, our framework employs
local extrinsic curvature on the data manifold as a quantitative measure of
individual vulnerability to MIA, providing a geometric foundation for targeted
privacy protection. By perturbing samples toward low-curvature regions, our
method effectively suppresses distinctive feature combinations that are
vulnerable to MIA. Through alternating optimization of both objectives, we
achieve a synergistic balance between privacy and utility. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method not only enhances
resistance to MIA in downstream tasks but also surpasses existing methods in
terms of sample quality and diversity.

Abstract: We introduce LUCIE-3D, a lightweight three-dimensional climate emulator
designed to capture the vertical structure of the atmosphere, respond to
climate change forcings, and maintain computational efficiency with long-term
stability. Building on the original LUCIE-2D framework, LUCIE-3D employs a
Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) backbone and is trained on 30 years of
ERA5 reanalysis data spanning eight vertical {\sigma}-levels. The model
incorporates atmospheric CO2 as a forcing variable and optionally integrates
prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) to simulate coupled ocean--atmosphere
dynamics. Results demonstrate that LUCIE-3D successfully reproduces
climatological means, variability, and long-term climate change signals,
including surface warming and stratospheric cooling under increasing CO2
concentrations. The model further captures key dynamical processes such as
equatorial Kelvin waves, the Madden--Julian Oscillation, and annular modes,
while showing credible behavior in the statistics of extreme events. Despite
requiring longer training than its 2D predecessor, LUCIE-3D remains efficient,
training in under five hours on four GPUs. Its combination of stability,
physical consistency, and accessibility makes it a valuable tool for rapid
experimentation, ablation studies, and the exploration of coupled climate
dynamics, with potential applications extending to paleoclimate research and
future Earth system emulation.

Conclusion: 通过考虑数据依赖的噪声尺度，该方法能更好地处理蛋白质数据的异质分布，为稀疏高维数据的生成建模提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models by
learning to iteratively reverse the noising process. Their ability to generate
high-quality samples has extended beyond high-dimensional image data to other
complex domains such as proteins, where data distributions are typically sparse
and unevenly spread. Importantly, the sparsity itself is uneven. Empirically,
we observed that while a small fraction of samples lie in dense clusters, the
majority occupy regions of varying sparsity across the data space. Existing
approaches largely ignore this data-dependent variability. In this work, we
introduce a Data-Dependent Smoothing Walk-Jump framework that employs kernel
density estimation (KDE) as a preprocessing step to estimate the noise scale
$\sigma$ for each data point, followed by training a score model with these
data-dependent $\sigma$ values. By incorporating local data geometry into the
denoising process, our method accounts for the heterogeneous distribution of
protein data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach yields
consistent improvements across multiple metrics, highlighting the importance of
data-aware sigma prediction for generative modeling in sparse, high-dimensional
settings.

Abstract: The automatic classification of occupational accident reports is a critical
research area for enhancing workplace safety and enabling large-scale risk
analysis. However, the severe class imbalance inherent in these real-world
datasets often compromises the performance of analytical models, particularly
for rare but severe incident types, hindering the development of reliable
automated systems. To address this challenge, we propose ABEX-RAT, a novel and
efficient framework that synergizes generative data augmentation with robust
adversarial training. Our approach first employs a twostep
abstractive-expansive (ABEX) pipeline, which leverages a large language model
to distill core incident semantics and then uses a generative model to create
diverse, highquality synthetic samples for underrepresented classes.
Subsequently, a lightweight classifier is trained on the augmented data using a
computationally efficient random adversarial training (RAT) protocol, which
stochastically applies perturbations to enhance model generalization and
robustness without significant overhead. Experimental results on the public
OSHA dataset demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, reaching a macro-F1 score of 90.32% and significantly
outperforming previous SOTA and fine-tuned large model baselines. Our work
validates that this synergistic strategy is a highly effective and efficient
alternative to brute-force fine-tuning for specialized, imbalanced
classification tasks. The code is publicly available

Most multi-view methods incorporating information-theoretic principles rely an
assumption called multi-view redundancy which states that common information
between views is necessary and sufficient for down-stream tasks. This
assumption emphasizes the importance of common information for prediction, but
inherently ignores the potential of unique information in each view that could
be predictive to the task. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive
information-theoretic multi-view learning framework named CIML, which discards
the assumption of multi-view redundancy. Specifically, CIML considers the
potential predictive capabilities of both common and unique information based
on information theory. First, the common representation learning maximizes
Gacs-Korner common information to extract shared features and then compresses
this information to learn task-relevant representations based on the
Information Bottleneck (IB). For unique representation learning, IB is employed
to achieve the most compressed unique representation for each view while
simultaneously minimizing the mutual information between unique and common
representations, as well as among different unique representations.
Importantly, we theoretically prove that the learned joint representation is
predictively sufficient for the downstream task. Extensive experimental results
have demonstrated the superiority of our model over several state-of-art
methods. The code is released on CIML.

Conclusion: 提出的Jensen-Shannon散度引导的模型融合方法为解决多任务学习中的任务干扰问题提供了有效解决方案，具有良好的扩展性和性能优势。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) is often achieved by merging datasets before
fine-tuning, but the growing availability of fine-tuned models has led to new
approaches such as model merging via task arithmetic. A major challenge in this
setting is task interference, which worsens as the number of tasks increases.
We propose a method that merges models trained on different tasks into a single
model, maintaining strong performance across all tasks. Our approach leverages
Jensen-Shannon divergence to guide the merging process without requiring
additional labelled data, and automatically balances task importance. Unlike
existing methods, our approach remains robust as the number of tasks grows and
consistently outperforms prior work.

Abstract: The Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm is a central tool in statistics
and machine learning, widely used for latent-variable models such as Gaussian
Mixture Models (GMMs). Despite its ubiquity, EM is typically treated as a
non-differentiable black box, preventing its integration into modern learning
pipelines where end-to-end gradient propagation is essential. In this work, we
present and compare several differentiation strategies for EM, from full
automatic differentiation to approximate methods, assessing their accuracy and
computational efficiency. As a key application, we leverage this differentiable
EM in the computation of the Mixture Wasserstein distance $\mathrm{MW}_2$
between GMMs, allowing $\mathrm{MW}_2$ to be used as a differentiable loss in
imaging and machine learning tasks. To complement our practical use of
$\mathrm{MW}_2$, we contribute a novel stability result which provides
theoretical justification for the use of $\mathrm{MW}_2$ with EM, and also
introduce a novel unbalanced variant of $\mathrm{MW}_2$. Numerical experiments
on barycentre computation, colour and style transfer, image generation, and
texture synthesis illustrate the versatility and effectiveness of the proposed
approach in different settings.

Conclusion: HiGraph数据集和工具为恶意软件分析提供了重要的层次化图数据资源，有助于构建更强大的检测器

Abstract: The advancement of graph-based malware analysis is critically limited by the
absence of large-scale datasets that capture the inherent hierarchical
structure of software. Existing methods often oversimplify programs into single
level graphs, failing to model the crucial semantic relationship between
high-level functional interactions and low-level instruction logic. To bridge
this gap, we introduce \dataset, the largest public hierarchical graph dataset
for malware analysis, comprising over \textbf{200M} Control Flow Graphs (CFGs)
nested within \textbf{595K} Function Call Graphs (FCGs). This two-level
representation preserves structural semantics essential for building robust
detectors resilient to code obfuscation and malware evolution. We demonstrate
HiGraph's utility through a large-scale analysis that reveals distinct
structural properties of benign and malicious software, establishing it as a
foundational benchmark for the community. The dataset and tools are publicly
available at https://higraph.org.

Abstract: In multi-armed bandit problems, the typical goal is to identify the arm with
the highest reward. This paper explores a threshold-based bandit problem,
aiming to select an arm based on its relation to a prescribed threshold \(\tau
\). We study variants where the optimal arm is the first above \(\tau\), the
\(k^{th}\) arm above or below it, or the closest to it, under a monotonic
structure of arm means. We derive asymptotic regret lower bounds, showing
dependence only on arms adjacent to \(\tau\). Motivated by applications in
communication networks (CQI allocation), clinical dosing, energy management,
recommendation systems, and more. We propose algorithms with optimality
validated through Monte Carlo simulations. Our work extends classical bandit
theory with threshold constraints for efficient decision-making.

Conclusion: 该零检查框架通过测试时缩放技术，有效解决了当前VPR方法的计算开销高和跨域迁移性差的问题，具有强大的实时适应能力和良好的通用性

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has evolved from handcrafted descriptors to
deep learning approaches, yet significant challenges remain. Current
approaches, including Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), enhance semantic understanding but suffer from high
computational overhead and limited cross-domain transferability when
fine-tuned. To address these limitations, we propose a novel zero-shot
framework employing Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that leverages MLLMs'
vision-language alignment capabilities through Guidance-based methods for
direct similarity scoring. Our approach eliminates two-stage processing by
employing structured prompts that generate length-controllable JSON outputs.
The TTS framework with Uncertainty-Aware Self-Consistency (UASC) enables
real-time adaptation without additional training costs, achieving superior
generalization across diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements in cross-domain VPR performance with up to 210$\times$

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法能够准确识别因果系统模型，同时对系统操作产生的干扰较低，实现了有效的在线因果模型识别。

Conclusion: 主动因果学习是首个用于IT系统在线因果模型识别的原则性方法，能够有效处理现代复杂动态系统的因果建模需求，为自动化网络和系统管理提供了重要技术支撑。

Abstract: Identifying a causal model of an IT system is fundamental to many branches of
systems engineering and operation. Such a model can be used to predict the
effects of control actions, optimize operations, diagnose failures, detect
intrusions, etc., which is central to achieving the longstanding goal of
automating network and system management tasks. Traditionally, causal models
have been designed and maintained by domain experts. This, however, proves
increasingly challenging with the growing complexity and dynamism of modern IT
systems. In this paper, we present the first principled method for online,
data-driven identification of an IT system in the form of a causal model. The
method, which we call active causal learning, estimates causal functions that
capture the dependencies among system variables in an iterative fashion using
Gaussian process regression based on system measurements, which are collected
through a rollout-based intervention policy. We prove that this method is
optimal in the Bayesian sense and that it produces effective interventions.
Experimental validation on a testbed shows that our method enables accurate
identification of a causal system model while inducing low interference with
system operations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Conditional-$t^3$VAE通过为每个类别定义Student's t联合先验，在潜在空间中实现公平分配，解决了传统VAE在类别不平衡数据集上生成公平性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VAE和$t^3$VAE在类别不平衡数据集上，潜在空间分配与训练集类别频率成正比，导致尾部类别表示不足，生成公平性降低。

Method: 提出Conditional-$t^3$VAE，为每个类别定义Student's t联合先验，防止多数类别主导，使用γ-power散度推导的闭式目标进行优化，并推导等权重潜在混合Student's t分布以实现类别平衡生成。

Result: 在SVHN-LT、CIFAR100-LT和CelebA数据集上，Conditional-$t^3$VAE始终获得比$t^3$VAE和高斯基VAE基线更低的FID分数，特别是在严重类别不平衡情况下。在每类F1评估中也优于条件高斯VAE。

Conclusion: 在轻微不平衡情况下高斯模型仍有竞争力，但在极端不平衡情况下，Conditional-$t^3$VAE显著提高了生成公平性和多样性。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with global priors mirror the training set's
class frequency in latent space, underrepresenting tail classes and reducing
generative fairness on imbalanced datasets. While $t^3$VAE improves robustness
via heavy-tailed Student's t-distribution priors, it still allocates latent
volume proportionally to the class frequency.In this work, we address this
issue by explicitly enforcing equitable latent space allocation across classes.
To this end, we propose Conditional-$t^3$VAE, which defines a per-class
\mbox{Student's t} joint prior over latent and output variables, preventing
dominance by majority classes. Our model is optimized using a closed-form
objective derived from the $\gamma$-power divergence. Moreover, for
class-balanced generation, we derive an equal-weight latent mixture of
Student's t-distributions. On SVHN-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and CelebA,
Conditional-$t^3$VAE consistently achieves lower FID scores than both $t^3$VAE
and Gaussian-based VAE baselines, particularly under severe class imbalance. In
per-class F1 evaluations, Conditional-$t^3$VAE also outperforms the conditional
Gaussian VAE across all highly imbalanced settings. While Gaussian-based models
remain competitive under mild imbalance ratio ($\rho \lesssim 3$), our approach
substantially improves generative fairness and diversity in more extreme
regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测-优化方法假设更准确的预测会产生更接近实际最优解的方案，但在复杂约束优化问题中验证这一假设具有挑战性，文献中往往被忽视。

Method: 开发了模拟多分类器预测的新算法，通过对二进制分类和多分类预测的模拟，实验评估预测误差对解质量的影响，并将算法应用于机器调度问题的预测-优化算法评估。

Result: 分类器性能可以以合理精度进行模拟，但存在一定变异性。实验表明预测误差与解接近最优程度的关系是非平凡的，并非简单的线性关系。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了基于机器学习预测的决策系统设计和评估中的重要考虑因素，预测准确性并不总是直接转化为更好的优化结果。

Abstract: Uncertainty in optimization is often represented as stochastic parameters in
the optimization model. In Predict-Then-Optimize approaches, predictions of a
machine learning model are used as values for such parameters, effectively
transforming the stochastic optimization problem into a deterministic one. This
two-stage framework is built on the assumption that more accurate predictions
result in solutions that are closer to the actual optimal solution. However,
providing evidence for this assumption in the context of complex, constrained
optimization problems is challenging and often overlooked in the literature.
Simulating predictions of machine learning models offers a way to
(experimentally) analyze how prediction error impacts solution quality without
the need to train real models. Complementing an algorithm from the literature
for simulating binary classification, we introduce a new algorithm for
simulating predictions of multiclass classifiers. We conduct a computational
study to evaluate the performance of these algorithms, and show that classifier
performance can be simulated with reasonable accuracy, although some
variability is observed. Additionally, we apply these algorithms to assess the
performance of a Predict-Then-Optimize algorithm for a machine scheduling
problem. The experiments demonstrate that the relationship between prediction
error and how close solutions are to the actual optimum is non-trivial,
highlighting important considerations for the design and evaluation of
decision-making systems based on machine learning predictions.

Motivation: 准确评估数据集复杂度对于知识图谱链接预测模型的比较至关重要，需要验证CSG指标在该领域的实际有效性

Method: 在标准知识图谱链接预测基准（FB15k-237、WN18RR等）上，通过系统改变CSG计算的两个关键参数M（蒙特卡洛采样点数）和K（最近邻数量），评估CSG的行为特性

Result: CSG对K参数选择高度敏感，无法自然随目标类别数量扩展；CSG值与MRR等性能指标相关性弱或无相关性；CSG在链接预测场景中的稳定性和泛化预测能力失效

Conclusion: 研究结果表明需要开发更鲁棒、分类器无关的复杂度度量方法来进行知识图谱链接预测评估

Abstract: Accurate estimation of dataset complexity is crucial for evaluating and
comparing link prediction models for knowledge graphs (KGs). The Cumulative
Spectral Gradient (CSG) metric derived from probabilistic divergence between
classes within a spectral clustering framework was proposed as a dataset
complexity measure that (1) naturally scales with the number of classes and (2)
correlates strongly with downstream classification performance. In this work,
we rigorously assess CSG behavior on standard knowledge graph link prediction
benchmarks a multi class tail prediction task, using two key parameters
governing its computation, M, the number of Monte Carlo sampled points per
class, and K, the number of nearest neighbors in the embedding space. Contrary
to the original claims, we find that (1) CSG is highly sensitive to the choice
of K and therefore does not inherently scale with the number of target classes,
and (2) CSG values exhibit weak or no correlation with established performance
metrics such as mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Through experiments on FB15k 237,
WN18RR, and other standard datasets, we demonstrate that CSG purported
stability and generalization predictive power break down in link prediction
settings. Our results highlight the need for more robust, classifier agnostic
complexity measures in KG link prediction evaluation.

Conclusion: DaCe AD提供了一个通用高效的自动微分解决方案，解决了现有AD框架的主要限制，特别适用于科学计算和机器学习集成应用

Abstract: Automatic differentiation (AD) is a set of techniques that systematically
applies the chain rule to compute the gradients of functions without requiring
human intervention. Although the fundamentals of this technology were
established decades ago, it is experiencing a renaissance as it plays a key
role in efficiently computing gradients for backpropagation in machine learning
algorithms. AD is also crucial for many applications in scientific computing
domains, particularly emerging techniques that integrate machine learning
models within scientific simulations and schemes. Existing AD frameworks have
four main limitations: limited support of programming languages, requiring code
modifications for AD compatibility, limited performance on scientific computing
codes, and a naive store-all solution for forward-pass data required for
gradient calculations. These limitations force domain scientists to manually
compute the gradients for large problems. This work presents DaCe AD, a
general, efficient automatic differentiation engine that requires no code
modifications. DaCe AD uses a novel ILP-based algorithm to optimize the
trade-off between storing and recomputing to achieve maximum performance within
a given memory constraint. We showcase the generality of our method by applying
it to NPBench, a suite of HPC benchmarks with diverse scientific computing
patterns, where we outperform JAX, a Python framework with state-of-the-art
general AD capabilities, by more than 92 times on average without requiring any
code changes.

Conclusion: 动态验证系统对於将LLM能力与实际临床应用对齐至关重要，在医疗AI部署的性能-参数权衡中建立了新的帕累托前沿

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance in conversational and reasoning
capabilities, their practical application in healthcare has become a critical
research focus. However, there is a notable gap between the performance of
medical LLMs on static benchmarks such as USMLE and their utility in real-world
clinical decision-making. This discrepancy arises because traditional exams
fail to capture the dynamic, interactive nature of medical consultations. To
address this challenge, we introduce a novel dynamic verification framework
that moves beyond static answer verifier, establishing a large-scale,
high-fidelity interactive reinforcement learning system. Our framework
comprises two key components: a Patient Simulator that creates realistic
clinical environments using de-identified medical records, and a Clinical
Rubrics Generator that dynamically produces multi-dimensional evaluation
metrics. Building on this foundation, we develop Baichuan-M2, a 32B-parameter
medical augmented reasoning model trained through a multi-stage reinforcement
learning strategy with an improved Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
algorithm. Evaluated on HealthBench, Baichuan-M2 outperforms all other
open-source models and most advanced closed-source counterparts, achieving a
score above 32 on the challenging HealthBench Hard benchmark-previously
exceeded only by GPT-5. Our work demonstrates that robust dynamic verifier
system is essential for aligning LLM capabilities with practical clinical
applications, establishing a new Pareto front in the performance-parameter
trade-off for medical AI deployment.

Abstract: In multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting, many deep learning based
methods have been proposed for modeling dependencies at multiple spatial
(inter-variate) or temporal (intra-variate) scales. However, existing methods
may fail to model dependencies across multiple spatial-temporal scales
(ST-scales, i.e., scales that jointly consider spatial and temporal scopes). In
this work, we propose ST-Hyper to model the high-order dependencies across
multiple ST-scales through adaptive hypergraph modeling. Specifically, we
introduce a Spatial-Temporal Pyramid Modeling (STPM) module to extract features
at multiple ST-scales. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Hypergraph
Modeling (AHM) module that learns a sparse hypergraph to capture robust
high-order dependencies among features. In addition, we interact with these
features through tri-phase hypergraph propagation, which can comprehensively
capture multi-scale spatial-temporal dynamics. Experimental results on six
real-world MTS datasets demonstrate that ST-Hyper achieves the state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming the best baselines with an average MAE reduction of
3.8\% and 6.8\% for long-term and short-term forecasting, respectively.

Abstract: A simple multi-agent system can be effectively utilized in disaster response
applications, such as firefighting. Such a swarm is required to operate in
complex environments with limited local sensing and no reliable inter-agent
communication or centralized control. These simple robotic agents, also known
as Ant Robots, are defined as anonymous agents that possess limited sensing
capabilities, lack a shared coordinate system, and do not communicate
explicitly with one another. A key challenge for simple swarms lies in
maintaining cohesion and avoiding fragmentation despite limited-range sensing.
Recent advances in machine learning offer effective solutions to some of the
classical decentralized control challenges. We propose VariAntNet, a deep
learning-based decentralized control model designed to facilitate agent
swarming and collaborative task execution. VariAntNet includes geometric
features extraction from unordered, variable-sized local observations. It
incorporates a neural network architecture trained with a novel,
differentiable, multi-objective, mathematically justified loss function that
promotes swarm cohesiveness by utilizing the properties of the visibility graph
Laplacian matrix. VariAntNet is demonstrated on the fundamental multi-agent
gathering task, where agents with bearing-only and limited-range sensing must
gather at some location. VariAntNet significantly outperforms an existing
analytical solution, achieving more than double the convergence rate while
maintaining high swarm connectivity across varying swarm sizes. While the
analytical solution guarantees cohesion, it is often too slow in practice. In
time-critical scenarios, such as emergency response operations where lives are
at risk, slower analytical methods are impractical and justify the loss of some
agents within the swarm. This paper presents and analyzes this trade-off in
detail.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习中概率预测的普遍应用，需要解决如何解释预测概率以及如何评估连续概率预测器在离散结果观察世界中的表现这一基础问题。

Method: 采用统一视角，将校准视为预测器假设的世界与真实世界（由自然或贝叶斯最优预测器控制）之间的一种不可区分性形式。

Result: 提出了各种校准度量方法，用于量化两个世界被特定类别的区分器或统计度量区分开来的程度。

Conclusion: 校准作为不可区分性的概念为理解和评估概率预测器提供了一个统一的理论框架，对下游决策制定具有重要意义。

Abstract: Calibration is a classical notion from the forecasting literature which aims
to address the question: how should predicted probabilities be interpreted? In
a world where we only get to observe (discrete) outcomes, how should we
evaluate a predictor that hypothesizes (continuous) probabilities over possible
outcomes? The study of calibration has seen a surge of recent interest, given
the ubiquity of probabilistic predictions in machine learning. This survey
describes recent work on the foundational questions of how to define and
measure calibration error, and what these measures mean for downstream decision
makers who wish to use the predictions to make decisions. A unifying viewpoint
that emerges is that of calibration as a form of indistinguishability, between
the world hypothesized by the predictor and the real world (governed by nature
or the Bayes optimal predictor). In this view, various calibration measures
quantify the extent to which the two worlds can be told apart by certain
classes of distinguishers or statistical measures.

TL;DR: 动态监护模型支持用户自定义政策，能够高效检测各种应用领域的违规行为，类似于前沿理解模型的准确性但更快速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准监护模型如LlamaGuard只能检测预定义的静态害害类别，无法满足不同应用领域的自定义政策需求

Method: 开发动态监护模型，支持用户自定义政策评估，提供快速检测和链式思绪推理两种模式

Result: 在静态害害类别检测上与静态模型准确性相当，在自由形式政策违规检测上达到前沿理解模型的准确性水平，但耗时更短

Conclusion: 动态监护模型提供了更灵活、高效的内容安全监管方案，能够满足多样化应用场景的自定义需求

Abstract: Guardian models are used to supervise and moderate the outputs of user-facing
chatbots, enforcing guardrails and detecting bad behaviors. Standard guardian
models like LlamaGuard detect predefined, static categories of harms. We
propose dynamic guardian models that evaluate text based on user-defined
policies, making them useful for different application domains that are not
addressed by standard guardian models. Our dynamic guardian models can be used
for fast detection of policy violations or with chain-of-thought reasoning that
articulates and justifies the model outputs. Our dynamic guardian models match
static models in detection accuracy for static harm categories while
identifying violations of free-form policies with accuracy comparable to
frontier reasoning models in a fraction of the time.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出UDI方法，通过单向动态交互策略替代传统的联合损失，主动解决多模态学习中的模态不平衡问题，实现更好的模态间交互和性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态联合学习会导致模态不平衡，强势模态压制弱势模态，限制了各模态单独信息和模态间交互信息的充分利用。现有方法都是被动检测和校正不平衡，无法从根本上解决联合损失的竞争性问题。

Method: 提出单向动态交互(UDI)策略：首先训练锚定模态至收敛，然后使用其学习到的表征通过无监督损失指导其他模态。通过动态调整模态交互，使模型适应具体任务，确保每个模态都能最优贡献。

Result: 实验结果表明，UDI在处理模态不平衡方面优于现有方法，在多模态学习任务中带来了性能提升。

Conclusion: UDI通过解耦模态优化和启用定向信息流，避免了单一模态的主导，促进了有效的跨模态特征学习，为多模态不平衡学习提供了新的有效策略。

Abstract: Multimodal learning typically utilizes multimodal joint loss to integrate
different modalities and enhance model performance. However, this joint
learning strategy can induce modality imbalance, where strong modalities
overwhelm weaker ones and limit exploitation of individual information from
each modality and the inter-modality interaction information.Existing
strategies such as dynamic loss weighting, auxiliary objectives and gradient
modulation mitigate modality imbalance based on joint loss. These methods
remain fundamentally reactive, detecting and correcting imbalance after it
arises, while leaving the competitive nature of the joint loss untouched. This
limitation drives us to explore a new strategy for multimodal imbalance
learning that does not rely on the joint loss, enabling more effective
interactions between modalities and better utilization of information from
individual modalities and their interactions. In this paper, we introduce
Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction (UDI), a novel strategy that abandons the
conventional joint loss in favor of a proactive, sequential training scheme.
UDI first trains the anchor modality to convergence, then uses its learned
representations to guide the other modality via unsupervised loss. Furthermore,
the dynamic adjustment of modality interactions allows the model to adapt to
the task at hand, ensuring that each modality contributes optimally. By
decoupling modality optimization and enabling directed information flow, UDI
prevents domination by any single modality and fosters effective cross-modal
feature learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that UDI outperforms
existing methods in handling modality imbalance, leading to performance
improvement in multimodal learning tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多周期在线决策问题中机器学习预测准确性无法保证的挑战，需要在利用预测提升性能的同时保持对错误预测的鲁棒性。

Method: 引入有界影响框架，提出AdaSwitch元算法，该算法能够根据预测质量动态切换策略，在预测准确时采用预测驱动策略，预测不准时回退到经典竞争算法。

Result: AdaSwitch算法在预测准确时性能接近离线最优解，在预测高度不准确时仍能保持经典的竞争比保证，适用于多种在线决策场景。

Conclusion: 该框架和元算法具有广泛的适用性，为学习增强的在线决策提供了灵活且通用的解决方案，可应用于处理系统、k-服务器问题和可重用资源分配等多个领域。

Abstract: We study a class of multi-period online decision-making problems with
sequence-based predictions, which may be generated by machine learning models
but whose accuracy is not guaranteed. In each period, the decision-maker
observes the realized request and must take an irrevocable action that yields a
reward or incurs a cost, without knowledge of future arrivals. We introduce a
bounded-influence framework, in which past decisions and requests exert only
limited impact on the future optimal reward. Within this framework, we propose
the AdaSwitch meta-algorithm, which exploits predictions to attain performance
close to the offline benchmark when predictions are accurate, while preserving
classical competitive-ratio guarantees under highly inaccurate predictions. Our
framework and meta-algorithm apply to diverse settings, including lead-time
quotation in processing systems, the $k$-server problem, and online allocation
of reusable resources. These applications illustrate the flexibility and broad
applicability of our approach to learning-augmented online decision-making.

Motivation: 解决文本分类中数据不平衡问题，特别是文本数据在过采样时特征空间会随着样本量增加而扩展的独特挑战

Method: 基于马尔可夫链的文本过采样方法，从少数类估计转移概率，同时部分参考多数类特征，允许少数类特征空间在过采样过程中扩展

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了文本数据不平衡分类中的特征空间扩展问题，为文本分类中的不平衡数据处理提供了新的有效解决方案

Abstract: Text classification is the task of automatically assigning text documents
correct labels from a predefined set of categories. In real-life (text)
classification tasks, observations and misclassification costs are often
unevenly distributed between the classes - known as the problem of imbalanced
data. Synthetic oversampling is a popular approach to imbalanced
classification. The idea is to generate synthetic observations in the minority
class to balance the classes in the training set. Many general-purpose
oversampling methods can be applied to text data; however, imbalanced text data
poses a number of distinctive difficulties that stem from the unique nature of
text compared to other domains. One such factor is that when the sample size of
text increases, the sample vocabulary (i.e., feature space) is likely to grow
as well. We introduce a novel Markov chain based text oversampling method. The
transition probabilities are estimated from the minority class but also partly
from the majority class, thus allowing the minority feature space to expand in
oversampling. We evaluate our approach against prominent oversampling methods
and show that our approach is able to produce highly competitive results
against the other methods in several real data examples, especially when the
imbalance is severe.

Result: 在8个多元数据集上评估，RDIT相比强基线实现了更低的CRPS、更快的推理速度和更好的覆盖率。

Conclusion: RDIT框架通过创新的点估计与扩散模型结合方式，有效解决了概率时间序列预测中的分布建模和指标匹配问题，取得了卓越性能。

Abstract: Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (PTSF) plays a critical role in domains
requiring accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions for decision-making.
However, existing methods offer suboptimal distribution modeling and suffer
from a mismatch between training and evaluation metrics. Surprisingly, we found
that augmenting a strong point estimator with a zero-mean Gaussian, whose
standard deviation matches its training error, can yield state-of-the-art
performance in PTSF. In this work, we propose RDIT, a plug-and-play framework
that combines point estimation and residual-based conditional diffusion with a
bidirectional Mamba network. We theoretically prove that the Continuous Ranked
Probability Score (CRPS) can be minimized by adjusting to an optimal standard
deviation and then derive algorithms to achieve distribution matching.
Evaluations on eight multivariate datasets across varied forecasting horizons
demonstrate that RDIT achieves lower CRPS, rapid inference, and improved
coverage compared to strong baselines.

<details>

Motivation: 联邦学习的成功依赖于参与者不可见的行为，需要从战略系统角度分析规则和激励机制，以识别真正改善性能的行为与仅针对指标的行为之间的差异。

Method: 引入两个指标分别量化行为激励和集体性能损失，基于此分析规则设计、信息披露水平、评估方法和聚合器切换等操作选择的影响，并提供检查清单、审计资源分配算法和性能保证。

Abstract: The success of Federated Learning depends on the actions that participants
take out of sight. We model Federated Learning not as a mere optimization task
but as a strategic system entangled with rules and incentives. From this
perspective, we present an analytical framework that makes it possible to
clearly identify where behaviors that genuinely improve performance diverge
from those that merely target metrics. We introduce two indices that
respectively quantify behavioral incentives and collective performance loss,
and we use them as the basis for consistently interpreting the impact of
operational choices such as rule design, the level of information disclosure,
evaluation methods, and aggregator switching. We further summarize thresholds,
auto-switch rules, and early warning signals into a checklist that can be
applied directly in practice, and we provide both a practical algorithm for
allocating limited audit resources and a performance guarantee. Simulations
conducted across diverse environments consistently validate the patterns
predicted by our framework, and we release all procedures for full
reproducibility. While our approach operates most strongly under several
assumptions, combining periodic recalibration, randomization, and
connectivity-based alarms enables robust application under the variability of
real-world operations. We present both design principles and operational
guidelines that lower the incentives for metric gaming while sustaining and
expanding stable cooperation.

Motivation: 随着人工神经网络逐渐成为测量系统的重要组成部分，需要理解它们如何处理和传输参数相关信息，特别是Fisher信息在神经网络中的传播机制。

Method: 提出了一种方法来监控Fisher信息在神经网络中的流动，从输入层到输出层跟踪信息传输过程。

Result: 研究表明最优估计性能对应于Fisher信息的最大传输，训练超过此点会导致信息损失和过拟合，这提供了一个无需单独验证数据集的训练停止准则。

Conclusion: 该方法在成像实验数据的神经网络训练中展示了实际应用价值，为神经网络训练提供了基于信息理论的有效停止准则。

Abstract: The estimation of continuous parameters from measured data plays a central
role in many fields of physics. A key tool in understanding and improving such
estimation processes is the concept of Fisher information, which quantifies how
information about unknown parameters propagates through a physical system and
determines the ultimate limits of precision. With Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs) gradually becoming an integral part of many measurement systems, it is
essential to understand how they process and transmit parameter-relevant
information internally. Here, we present a method to monitor the flow of Fisher
information through an ANN performing a parameter estimation task, tracking it
from the input to the output layer. We show that optimal estimation performance
corresponds to the maximal transmission of Fisher information, and that
training beyond this point results in information loss due to overfitting. This
provides a model-free stopping criterion for network training-eliminating the
need for a separate validation dataset. To demonstrate the practical relevance
of our approach, we apply it to a network trained on data from an imaging
experiment, highlighting its effectiveness in a realistic physical setting.

Motivation: 大语言模型参数量庞大，专家混合架构虽然减少了激活参数，但带来了专家缓存管理的挑战。需要高效管理有限的高速缓存，确保常用专家存储在快速缓存中。

Method: 提出新的分页问题建模专家管理优化，考虑LLM的层次架构和专家缓存需求。首先分析确定性/随机算法的竞争比下界，然后提出针对性的层次化LRU扩展算法。

Result: 理论分析显示LRU类策略具有良好的竞争性能。在合成数据集和实际MoE使用轨迹上的大量模拟表明，新算法优于经典分页问题的标准LRU策略。

Conclusion: 提出的层次化LRU算法能有效优化专家混合架构中的缓存管理，为LLM部署中的内存管理问题提供了理论支持和实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a variety of tasks. One of the main challenges towards the successful
deployment of LLMs is memory management, since they typically involve billions
of parameters. To this end, architectures based on Mixture-of-Experts have been
proposed, which aim to reduce the size of the parameters that are activated
when producing a token. This raises the equally critical issue of efficiently
managing the limited cache of the system, in that frequently used experts
should be stored in the fast cache rather than in the slower secondary memory.
  In this work, we introduce and study a new paging problem that models expert
management optimization. Our formulation captures both the layered architecture
of LLMs and the requirement that experts are cached efficiently. We first
present lower bounds on the competitive ratio of both deterministic and
randomized algorithms, which show that under mild assumptions, LRU-like
policies have good theoretical competitive performance. We then propose a
layer-based extension of LRU that is tailored to the problem at hand.
  Extensive simulations on both synthetic datasets and actual traces of MoE
usage show that our algorithm outperforms policies for the classic paging
problem, such as the standard LRU.

Motivation: 元学习面临的主要挑战是如何高效地利用从相关任务中获得的任务不变知识来快速适应新任务。传统的线性预处理方法在处理复杂损失几何形状时效果有限，需要更强大的方法来捕获和优化各种损失几何。

Conclusion: 所提出的非线性镜像映射方法能够有效处理复杂损失几何，在保持理论收敛性的同时，显著提高了元学习的样本效率和适应性，特别适用于大规模元学习模型。

Abstract: Utilizing task-invariant knowledge acquired from related tasks as prior
information, meta-learning offers a principled approach to learning a new task
with limited data records. Sample-efficient adaptation of this prior
information is a major challenge facing meta-learning, and plays an important
role because it facilitates training the sought task-specific model with just a
few optimization steps. Past works deal with this challenge through
preconditioning that speeds up convergence of the per-task training. Though
effective in representing locally quadratic loss curvatures, simple linear
preconditioning can be hardly potent with complex loss geometries. Instead of
relying on a quadratic distance metric, the present contribution copes with
complex loss metrics by learning a versatile distance-generating function,
which induces a nonlinear mirror map to effectively capture and optimize a wide
range of loss geometries. With suitable parameterization, this generating
function is effected by an expressive neural network that is provably a valid
distance. Analytical results establish convergence of not only the proposed
method, but also all meta-learning approaches based on preconditioning. To
attain gradient norm less than $\epsilon$, the convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ is on par with standard gradient-based
meta-learning methods. Numerical tests on few-shot learning datasets
demonstrate the superior empirical performance of the novel algorithm, as well
as its rapid per-task convergence, which markedly reduces the number of
adaptation steps, hence also accommodating large-scale meta-learning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM方法虽然通过寻找平坦最小值来提升泛化能力，但在实践中存在对抗扰动过于友好的问题，限制了泛化性能的进一步提升。

Method: 提出VASSO（方差抑制）方法来稳定对抗扰动，通过抑制方差来避免过度友好的对抗样本，可与SAM及其计算高效变体结合使用。

Result: 在广泛的视觉和语言任务上验证了VASSO+SAM组合能够提供更好的泛化性能，并在计算效率与泛化能力之间取得良好平衡。

Conclusion: VASSO提供了一种通用的方法来稳定对抗扰动，有效解决了SAM中对抗样本过于友好的问题，显著提升了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) has well-documented merits in enhancing
generalization of deep neural network models. Accounting for sharpness in the
loss function geometry, where neighborhoods of `flat minima' heighten
generalization ability, SAM seeks `flat valleys' by minimizing the maximum loss
provoked by an adversarial perturbation within the neighborhood. Although
critical to account for sharpness of the loss function, in practice SAM suffers
from `over-friendly adversaries,' which can curtail the outmost level of
generalization. To avoid such `friendliness,' the present contribution fosters
stabilization of adversaries through variance suppression (VASSO). VASSO offers
a general approach to provably stabilize adversaries. In particular, when
integrating VASSO with SAM, improved generalizability is numerically validated
on extensive vision and language tasks. Once applied on top of a
computationally efficient SAM variant, VASSO offers a desirable
generalization-computation tradeoff.

Abstract: Notifications are an important communication channel for delivering timely
and relevant information. Optimizing their delivery involves addressing complex
sequential decision-making challenges under constraints such as message utility
and user fatigue. Offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods, such as
Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), have been applied to this problem but face
practical challenges at scale, including instability, sensitivity to
distribution shifts, limited reproducibility, and difficulties with
explainability in high-dimensional recommendation settings. We present a
Decision Transformer (DT) based framework that reframes policy learning as
return-conditioned supervised learning, improving robustness, scalability, and
modeling flexibility. Our contributions include a real-world comparison with
CQL, a multi-reward design suitable for non-episodic tasks, a quantile
regression approach to return-to-go conditioning, and a production-ready system
with circular buffer-based sequence processing for near-real-time inference.
Extensive offline and online experiments in a deployed notification system show
that our approach improves notification utility and overall session activity
while minimizing user fatigue. Compared to a multi-objective CQL-based agent,
the DT-based approach achieved a +0.72% increase in sessions for notification
decision-making at LinkedIn by making notification recommendation more
relevant.

Abstract: To address the lack of public power system data for machine learning research
in energy networks, we investigate the use of variational graph autoencoders
(VGAEs) for synthetic distribution grid generation. Using two open-source
datasets, ENGAGE and DINGO, we evaluate four decoder variants and compare
generated networks against the original grids using structural and spectral
metrics. Results indicate that simple decoders fail to capture realistic
topologies, while GCN-based approaches achieve strong fidelity on ENGAGE but
struggle on the more complex DINGO dataset, producing artifacts such as
disconnected components and repeated motifs. These findings highlight both the
promise and limitations of VGAEs for grid synthesis, underscoring the need for
more expressive generative models and robust evaluation. We release our models

ML-driven power system research.

Motivation: 多轮工具集成推理(TIR)的强化学习训练存在不稳定性和性能崩溃问题，主要由外部工具反馈导致的分布漂移和低概率token生成引起，这会在连续轮次中累积并导致灾难性的梯度范数爆炸。

Conclusion: SimpleTIR是一种即插即用的算法，能有效稳定多轮TIR训练，通过过滤无效轨迹解决了训练不稳定问题，显著提升了模型在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can significantly improve their reasoning
capabilities by interacting with external tools, a paradigm known as
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). However, extending TIR to multi-turn scenarios
using Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often hindered by training instability and
performance collapse. We identify that such instability is primarily caused by
a distributional drift from external tool feedback, leading to the generation
of low-probability tokens. This issue compounds over successive turns, causing
catastrophic gradient norm explosions that derail the training process. To
address this challenge, we introduce SimpleTIR , a plug-and-play algorithm that
stabilizes multi-turn TIR training. Its core strategy is to identify and filter
out trajectories containing void turns, i.e., turns that yield neither a code
block nor a final answer. By removing these problematic trajectories from the
policy update, SimpleTIR effectively blocks the harmful, high-magnitude
gradients, thus stabilizing the learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show
that SimpleTIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging math
reasoning benchmarks, notably elevating the AIME24 score from a text-only
baseline of 22.1 to 50.5 when starting from the Qwen2.5-7B base model.
Furthermore, by avoiding the constraints of supervised fine-tuning, SimpleTIR
encourages the model to discover diverse and sophisticated reasoning patterns,
such as self-correction and cross-validation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出HydroGAT模型，通过异质流域图和高分辨率时空网络实现精确的洪水预报，在小时尺度径流预测中达到优异性能，并开发了分布式训练框架实现高效扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据驱动方法忽略流域拓扑信息，现有GNN方法因计算成本高而降低分辨率，且时空依赖关系分离处理，无法同时捕捉对洪水预测至关重要的时空交互作用。

Method: 构建异质流域图（每个陆地和河流像素作为节点），提出HydroGAT时空网络，自适应学习局部时间重要性和最具影响力的上游位置，并开发分布式数据并行训练管道。

Result: 在美国中西部两个流域的评估中，模型在小时径流预测中达到NSE最高0.97、KGE最高0.96、PBIAS在±5%以内的优异性能，同时在NERSC Perlmutter超级计算机上实现15倍加速。

Conclusion: HydroGAT通过高分辨率时空建模和分布式训练框架，成功解决了洪水预测中的时空交互和计算扩展挑战，提供了可解释的注意力图谱和高效的训练解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate flood forecasting remains a challenge for water-resource management,
as it demands modeling of local, time-varying runoff drivers (e.g.,
rainfall-induced peaks, baseflow trends) and complex spatial interactions
across a river network. Traditional data-driven approaches, such as
convolutional networks and sequence-based models, ignore topological
information about the region. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate
information exactly along the river network, which is ideal for learning
hydrological routing. However, state-of-the-art GNN-based flood prediction
models collapse pixels to coarse catchment polygons as the cost of training
explodes with graph size and higher resolution. Furthermore, most existing
methods treat spatial and temporal dependencies separately, either applying
GNNs solely on spatial graphs or transformers purely on temporal sequences,
thus failing to simultaneously capture spatiotemporal interactions critical for
accurate flood prediction. We introduce a heterogenous basin graph where every
land and river pixel is a node connected by physical hydrological flow
directions and inter-catchment relationships. We propose HydroGAT, a
spatiotemporal network that adaptively learns local temporal importance and the
most influential upstream locations. Evaluated in two Midwestern US basins and
across five baseline architectures, our model achieves higher NSE (up to 0.97),
improved KGE (up to 0.96), and low bias (PBIAS within $\pm$5%) in hourly
discharge prediction, while offering interpretable attention maps that reveal
sparse, structured intercatchment influences. To support high-resolution
basin-scale training, we develop a distributed data-parallel pipeline that
scales efficiently up to 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs on NERSC Perlmutter supercomputer,
demonstrating up to 15x speedup across machines. Our code is available at

Abstract: B\"uchi automata (BAs) recognize $\omega$-regular languages defined by formal
specifications like linear temporal logic (LTL) and are commonly used in the
verification of reactive systems. However, BAs face scalability challenges when
handling and manipulating complex system behaviors. As neural networks are
increasingly used to address these scalability challenges in areas like model
checking, investigating their ability to generalize beyond training data
becomes necessary. This work presents the first study investigating whether
recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can generalize to $\omega$-regular languages
derived from LTL formulas. We train RNNs on ultimately periodic $\omega$-word
sequences to replicate target BA behavior and evaluate how well they generalize
to out-of-distribution sequences. Through experiments on LTL formulas
corresponding to deterministic automata of varying structural complexity, from
3 to over 100 states, we show that RNNs achieve high accuracy on their target
$\omega$-regular languages when evaluated on sequences up to $8 \times$ longer
than training examples, with $92.6\%$ of tasks achieving perfect or
near-perfect generalization. These results establish the feasibility of neural
approaches for learning complex $\omega$-regular languages, suggesting their
potential as components in neurosymbolic verification methods.

Abstract: Large Language and Vision Models using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architecture pose significant challenges for deployment due to their
computational and memory demands. Mixed Precision Quantization assigns
different precisions to different layers of an LLM/VLM based on layer
sensitivity and importance within the model. In this work, we propose a Post
Training Quantization algorithm, MoPEQ, that assigns optimal bit width to each
expert. Our method balances accuracy and model size by analyzing each expert's
sensitivity using Hessian trace approximation instead of relying on the
activation frequency of the expert. This per-expert granularity approach
clusters similar experts to maintain model performance while reducing memory
requirements. The experimental results on VLMEvalKit benchmark datasets using
State-of-the-art VLMs Deepseek-VL2 -tiny, -small, -base, and MolmoE models
demonstrate that our mixed precision quantized MoEs achieve competitive
accuracy with substantial improvements in memory footprint compared to
uniform-precision baseline methods. We perform a comprehensive study to analyze
the impact of expert activation frequency and sensitivity using Hessian trace
approximation at both layer-wise and model-wide expert precision allocation of
2, 3, and 4 bits to provide a thorough understanding of mixed precision
quantization of VLM-MoEs.

Abstract: Model merging techniques aim to integrate the abilities of multiple models
into a single model. Most model merging techniques have hyperparameters, and
their setting affects the performance of the merged model. Because several
existing works show that tuning hyperparameters in model merging can enhance
the merging outcome, developing hyperparameter optimization algorithms for
model merging is a promising direction. However, its optimization process is
computationally expensive, particularly in merging LLMs. In this work, we
develop surrogate benchmarks for optimization of the merging hyperparameters to
realize algorithm development and performance comparison at low cost. We define
two search spaces and collect data samples to construct surrogate models to
predict the performance of a merged model from a hyperparameter. We demonstrate
that our benchmarks can predict the performance of merged models well and
simulate optimization algorithm behaviors.

Result: 模型恢复了不同的缩放机制，发现在某些机制下特征流形会导致SAE学习的特征数量远少于潜在变量数量。

Conclusion: SAE在真实场景中可能存在病理性缩放机制，需要进一步研究验证。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) model the activations of a neural network as
linear combinations of sparsely occurring directions of variation (latents).
The ability of SAEs to reconstruct activations follows scaling laws w.r.t. the
number of latents. In this work, we adapt a capacity-allocation model from the
neural scaling literature (Brill, 2024) to understand SAE scaling, and in
particular, to understand how "feature manifolds" (multi-dimensional features)
influence scaling behavior. Consistent with prior work, the model recovers
distinct scaling regimes. Notably, in one regime, feature manifolds have the
pathological effect of causing SAEs to learn far fewer features in data than
there are latents in the SAE. We provide some preliminary discussion on whether
or not SAEs are in this pathological regime in the wild.

Abstract: Learning with physical systems is an emerging paradigm that seeks to harness
the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of physical substrates for learning. The
impetus for a paradigm shift in how hardware is used for computational
intelligence stems largely from the unsustainability of artificial neural
network software implemented on conventional transistor-based hardware. This
Perspective highlights one promising approach using physical networks comprised
of resistive memory nanoscale components with dynamically reconfigurable,
self-organising electrical circuitry. Experimental advances have revealed the
non-trivial interactions within these Self-Organising Memristive Networks
(SOMNs), offering insights into their collective nonlinear and adaptive
dynamics, and how these properties can be harnessed for learning using
different hardware implementations. Theoretical approaches, including
mean-field theory, graph theory, and concepts from disordered systems, reveal
deeper insights into the dynamics of SOMNs, especially during transitions
between different conductance states where criticality and other dynamical
phase transitions emerge in both experiments and models. Furthermore, parallels
between adaptive dynamics in SOMNs and plasticity in biological neuronal
networks suggest the potential for realising energy-efficient, brain-like
continual learning. SOMNs thus offer a promising route toward embedded edge
intelligence, unlocking real-time decision-making for autonomous systems,
dynamic sensing, and personalised healthcare, by enabling embedded learning in
resource-constrained environments. The overarching aim of this Perspective is
to show how the convergence of nanotechnology, statistical physics, complex
systems, and self-organising principles offers a unique opportunity to advance
a new generation of physical intelligence technologies.

Conclusion: 通过相图分析方法可以有效指导SGD超参数选择，权重矩阵奇异值动态是识别不同训练阶段的关键指标，该方法为超参数调优提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning is one of the essential steps to guarantee the
convergence of machine learning models. We argue that intuition about the
optimal choice of hyperparameters for stochastic gradient descent can be
obtained by studying a neural network's phase diagram, in which each phase is
characterised by distinctive dynamics of the singular values of weight
matrices. Taking inspiration from disordered systems, we start from the
observation that the loss landscape of a multilayer neural network with mean
squared error can be interpreted as a disordered system in feature space, where
the learnt features are mapped to soft spin degrees of freedom, the initial
variance of the weight matrices is interpreted as the strength of the disorder,
and temperature is given by the ratio of the learning rate and the batch size.
As the model is trained, three phases can be identified, in which the dynamics
of weight matrices is qualitatively different. Employing a Langevin equation
for stochastic gradient descent, previously derived using Dyson Brownian
motion, we demonstrate that the three dynamical regimes can be classified
effectively, providing practical guidance for the choice of hyperparameters of
the optimiser.

Conclusion: GS-TG通过创新的瓦片分组和位掩码技术有效解决了3D-GS渲染中的计算效率问题，是一种无损且可与其他优化技术无缝集成的加速方案

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged as a promising alternative to
neural radiance fields (NeRF) as it offers high speed as well as high image
quality in novel view synthesis. Despite these advancements, 3D-GS still
struggles to meet the frames per second (FPS) demands of real-time
applications. In this paper, we introduce GS-TG, a tile-grouping-based
accelerator that enhances 3D-GS rendering speed by reducing redundant sorting
operations and preserving rasterization efficiency. GS-TG addresses a critical
trade-off issue in 3D-GS rendering: increasing the tile size effectively
reduces redundant sorting operations, but it concurrently increases unnecessary
rasterization computations. So, during sorting of the proposed approach, GS-TG
groups small tiles (for making large tiles) to share sorting operations across
tiles within each group, significantly reducing redundant computations. During
rasterization, a bitmask assigned to each Gaussian identifies relevant small
tiles, to enable efficient sharing of sorting results. Consequently, GS-TG
enables sorting to be performed as if a large tile size is used by grouping
tiles during the sorting stage, while allowing rasterization to proceed with
the original small tiles by using bitmasks in the rasterization stage. GS-TG is
a lossless method requiring no retraining or fine-tuning and it can be
seamlessly integrated with previous 3D-GS optimization techniques. Experimental
results show that GS-TG achieves an average speed-up of 1.54 times over
state-of-the-art 3D-GS accelerators.

Abstract: In recent years, the space community has been exploring the possibilities of
Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs),
for a variety of on board applications. However, this development is limited by
the restricted energy budget of smallsats and cubesats as well as radiation
concerns plaguing modern chips. This necessitates research into neural network
accelerators capable of meeting these requirements whilst satisfying the
compute and performance needs of the application. This paper explores the use
of Phase-Change Memory (PCM) and Resistive Random-Access Memory (RRAM)
memristors for on-board in-memory computing AI acceleration in space
applications. A guidance and control neural network (G\&CNET) accelerated using
memristors is simulated in a variety of scenarios and with both device types to
evaluate the performance of memristor-based accelerators, considering device
non-idealities such as noise and conductance drift. We show that the memristive
accelerator is able to learn the expert actions, though challenges remain with
the impact of noise on accuracy. We also show that re-training after
degradation is able to restore performance to nominal levels. This study
provides a foundation for future research into memristor-based AI accelerators
for space, highlighting their potential and the need for further investigation.

Abstract: Fire is a highly destructive disaster, but effective prevention can
significantly reduce its likelihood of occurrence. When it happens, deploying
emergency robots in fire-risk scenarios can help minimize the danger to human
responders. However, current research on pre-disaster warnings and
disaster-time rescue still faces significant challenges due to incomplete
perception, inadequate fire situational awareness, and delayed response. To
enhance intelligent perception and response planning for robots in fire
scenarios, we first construct a knowledge graph (KG) by leveraging large
language models (LLMs) to integrate fire domain knowledge derived from fire
prevention guidelines and fire rescue task information from robotic emergency
response documents. We then propose a new framework called Insights-on-Graph
(IOG), which integrates the structured fire information of KG and Large
Multimodal Models (LMMs). The framework generates perception-driven risk graphs
from real-time scene imagery to enable early fire risk detection and provide
interpretable emergency responses for task module and robot component
configuration based on the evolving risk situation. Extensive simulations and
real-world experiments show that IOG has good applicability and practical

Abstract: Swarm UAV autonomous flight for Long-Horizon (LH) tasks is crucial for
advancing the low-altitude economy. However, existing methods focus only on
specific basic tasks due to dataset limitations, failing in real-world
deployment for LH tasks. LH tasks are not mere concatenations of basic tasks,
requiring handling long-term dependencies, maintaining persistent states, and
adapting to dynamic goal shifts. This paper presents U2UData-2, the first
large-scale swarm UAV autonomous flight dataset for LH tasks and the first
scalable swarm UAV data online collection and algorithm closed-loop
verification platform. The dataset is captured by 15 UAVs in autonomous
collaborative flights for LH tasks, comprising 12 scenes, 720 traces, 120
hours, 600 seconds per trajectory, 4.32M LiDAR frames, and 12.96M RGB frames.
This dataset also includes brightness, temperature, humidity, smoke, and
airflow values covering all flight routes. The platform supports the
customization of simulators, UAVs, sensors, flight algorithms, formation modes,
and LH tasks. Through a visual control window, this platform allows users to
collect customized datasets through one-click deployment online and to verify
algorithms by closed-loop simulation. U2UData-2 also introduces an LH task for
wildlife conservation and provides comprehensive benchmarks with 9 SOTA models.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出一种混合式强化学习方法，通过将演化器轨迹生成与学习模型的求导计算解耦，实现高效且稳定的一阶策略优化，无需依赖演化器的导数信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于演化器导数的RL方法效果优异，但实际中获取演化器导数成本高或不可行；而基于学习模型的MBRL方法又存在预测错误堆积问题，影响策略性能。

Method: 提出一种混合设计：使用演化器展开轨迹，同时通过学习的可微分模型进行反向传播计算梯度。这种方法还支持从模拟轨迹中学习更准确的评估器。

Result: 方法在标准控制任务和真实Go2四足机器人上验证有效，在四足和双足行走任务中都表现优异，达到了SHAC等专门优化器的样本效率和速度。

Conclusion: 该方法结合了专门优化器的高效性和标准方法的通用性，避免了其他一阶MBRL方法的不良行为，为无法获取演化器导数的场景提供了高效稳定的策略优化方案。

Abstract: There is growing interest in reinforcement learning (RL) methods that
leverage the simulator's derivatives to improve learning efficiency. While
early gradient-based approaches have demonstrated superior performance compared
to derivative-free methods, accessing simulator gradients is often impractical
due to their implementation cost or unavailability. Model-based RL (MBRL) can
approximate these gradients via learned dynamics models, but the solver
efficiency suffers from compounding prediction errors during training rollouts,
which can degrade policy performance. We propose an approach that decouples
trajectory generation from gradient computation: trajectories are unrolled
using a simulator, while gradients are computed via backpropagation through a
learned differentiable model of the simulator. This hybrid design enables
efficient and consistent first-order policy optimization, even when simulator
gradients are unavailable, as well as learning a critic from simulation
rollouts, which is more accurate. Our method achieves the sample efficiency and
speed of specialized optimizers such as SHAC, while maintaining the generality
of standard approaches like PPO and avoiding ill behaviors observed in other
first-order MBRL methods. We empirically validate our algorithm on benchmark
control tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness on a real Go2 quadruped robot,
across both quadrupedal and bipedal locomotion tasks.

TL;DR: TReF-6是一种从单条轨迹推断6自由度任务相关框架的方法，通过几何分析识别影响点来定义局部坐标系，结合视觉语言模型实现语义理解和跨场景泛化，支持一次性模仿学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人通常难以从单次演示中泛化，因为缺乏可迁移和可解释的空间表示。需要一种能够从轨迹几何中提取任务空间结构并实现跨场景一致泛化的方法。

Method: 从轨迹几何中纯几何地识别影响点来定义局部坐标系的原点，作为动态运动基元(DMP)的参数化参考。通过视觉语言模型进行语义接地，使用Grounded-SAM在新场景中定位推断的框架。

Result: 在仿真中验证了TReF-6的有效性，证明了对轨迹噪声的鲁棒性。在真实世界操作任务中部署端到端流水线，展示了跨不同物体配置保持任务意图的一次性模仿学习能力。

Conclusion: TReF-6通过推断任务相关框架，扩展了标准DMP formulation，实现了功能一致的技能泛化，为机器人从单次演示中学习提供了有效的空间表示方法。

Abstract: Robots often struggle to generalize from a single demonstration due to the
lack of a transferable and interpretable spatial representation. In this work,
we introduce TReF-6, a method that infers a simplified, abstracted 6DoF
Task-Relevant Frame from a single trajectory. Our approach identifies an
influence point purely from the trajectory geometry to define the origin for a
local frame, which serves as a reference for parameterizing a Dynamic Movement
Primitive (DMP). This influence point captures the task's spatial structure,
extending the standard DMP formulation beyond start-goal imitation. The
inferred frame is semantically grounded via a vision-language model and
localized in novel scenes by Grounded-SAM, enabling functionally consistent
skill generalization. We validate TReF-6 in simulation and demonstrate
robustness to trajectory noise. We further deploy an end-to-end pipeline on
real-world manipulation tasks, showing that TReF-6 supports one-shot imitation
learning that preserves task intent across diverse object configurations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间环境中机器人自主性面临感知运动不确定性、严格运动学约束和有限人工干预机会等挑战，需要任务与运动规划技术

Method: 采用AND/OR图编码任务级抽象，迭代扩展图结构，执行在线运动规划可行性评估，处理不可预测环境信息

Result: 在模拟移动机械臂上评估显示，TMP-EAOG能够处理基准测试中的各种挑战，适应不同场景

Conclusion: TMP-EAOG框架为空间自主机器人提供了有效的任务运动规划解决方案，具有应对不确定性和意外事件的能力

Abstract: Robot autonomy in space environments presents unique challenges, including
high perception and motion uncertainty, strict kinematic constraints, and
limited opportunities for human intervention. Therefore, Task and Motion
Planning (TMP) may be critical for autonomous servicing, surface operations, or
even in-orbit missions, just to name a few, as it models tasks as discrete
action sequencing integrated with continuous motion feasibility assessments. In
this paper, we introduce a TMP framework based on expanding AND/OR graphs,
referred to as TMP-EAOG, and demonstrate its adaptability to different
scenarios. TMP-EAOG encodes task-level abstractions within an AND/OR graph,
which expands iteratively as the plan is executed, and performs in-the-loop
motion planning assessments to ascertain their feasibility. As a consequence,
TMP-EAOG is characterised by the desirable properties of (i) robustness to a
certain degree of uncertainty, because AND/OR graph expansion can accommodate
for unpredictable information about the robot environment, (ii) controlled
autonomy, since an AND/OR graph can be validated by human experts, and (iii)
bounded flexibility, in that unexpected events, including the assessment of
unfeasible motions, can lead to different courses of action as alternative
paths in the AND/OR graph. We evaluate TMP-EAOG on two benchmark domains. We
use a simulated mobile manipulator as a proxy for space-grade autonomous
robots. Our evaluation shows that TMP-EAOG can deal with a wide range of
challenges in the benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出基于深度强化学习的接触辅助导航策略，利用接触力反馈提升柔性内窥镜在动态胃部环境中的导航精度和稳定性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 柔性内窥镜在动态胃部导航具有挑战性，需要学习利用与可变形胃壁的接触来准确到达目标位置

Method: 使用基于物理的有限元方法模拟可变形胃部环境，采用近端策略优化算法训练接触辅助导航策略

Result: 在静态和动态胃部环境中达到100%成功率（平均误差1.6mm），在未见过的挑战性场景中保持85%成功率

Conclusion: 基于深度强化学习的接触辅助导航策略显著优于现有方法，大幅提升了柔性内窥镜的导航性能

Abstract: Navigating a flexible robotic endoscope (FRE) through the gastrointestinal
tract is critical for surgical diagnosis and treatment. However, navigation in
the dynamic stomach is particularly challenging because the FRE must learn to
effectively use contact with the deformable stomach walls to reach target
locations. To address this, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
based Contact-Aided Navigation (CAN) strategy for FREs, leveraging contact
force feedback to enhance motion stability and navigation precision. The
training environment is established using a physics-based finite element method
(FEM) simulation of a deformable stomach. Trained with the Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) algorithm, our approach achieves high navigation success
rates (within 3 mm error between the FRE's end-effector and target) and
significantly outperforms baseline policies. In both static and dynamic stomach
environments, the CAN agent achieved a 100% success rate with 1.6 mm average
error, and it maintained an 85% success rate in challenging unseen scenarios
with stronger external disturbances. These results validate that the DRL-based
CAN strategy substantially enhances FRE navigation performance over prior
methods.

TL;DR: JEDP-RL框架通过分阶段雅可比矩阵估计和策略执行，解决了可变形连续体机器人的规划问题，相比PPO基线方法在收敛速度、导航效率和泛化能力方面均有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可变形连续体机器人由于非线性变形力学和部分状态可观测性，违反了传统强化学习的马尔可夫假设，而基于雅可比的方法在时变运动学和欠驱动变形动力学方面存在局限性。

Method: 提出JEDP-RL框架，将规划分解为分阶段的雅可比估计和策略执行：首先执行小规模局部探索动作估计变形雅可比矩阵，然后用雅可比特征增强状态表示以恢复近似马尔可夫性。

Result: 在SOFA手术动态仿真中，JEDP-RL相比PPO基线：收敛速度快3.2倍，导航效率提高25%（到达目标所需步骤减少25%），在材料属性变化下达到92%成功率，在未见组织环境中达到83%成功率（比PPO高33%）。

Conclusion: JEDP-RL框架通过雅可比探索和状态增强有效解决了可变形连续体机器人的规划挑战，在仿真环境中展现出优越的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Deformable continuum robots (DCRs) present unique planning challenges due to
nonlinear deformation mechanics and partial state observability, violating the
Markov assumptions of conventional reinforcement learning (RL) methods. While
Jacobian-based approaches offer theoretical foundations for rigid manipulators,
their direct application to DCRs remains limited by time-varying kinematics and
underactuated deformation dynamics. This paper proposes Jacobian Exploratory
Dual-Phase RL (JEDP-RL), a framework that decomposes planning into phased
Jacobian estimation and policy execution. During each training step, we first
perform small-scale local exploratory actions to estimate the deformation
Jacobian matrix, then augment the state representation with Jacobian features
to restore approximate Markovianity. Extensive SOFA surgical dynamic
simulations demonstrate JEDP-RL's three key advantages over proximal policy
optimization (PPO) baselines: 1) Convergence speed: 3.2x faster policy
convergence, 2) Navigation efficiency: requires 25% fewer steps to reach the
target, and 3) Generalization ability: achieve 92% success rate under material
property variations and achieve 83% (33% higher than PPO) success rate in the
unseen tissue environment.

scene representation and spatial reasoning. For perception, we develop robust,
scalable, and accurate scene representations using implicit neural models, with
contributions in self-supervised camera calibration, high-fidelity depth field
generation, and large-scale reconstruction. For spatial reasoning, we enhance
the spatial capabilities of LLMs by introducing a novel navigation benchmark, a
method for grounding language in 3D, and a state-feedback mechanism to improve
long-horizon decision-making. This work lays a foundation for robots that can
robustly perceive their surroundings and intelligently act upon complex,
language-based commands.

Abstract: Robot manipulation in unstructured environments requires efficient and
reliable Swept Volume Collision Detection (SVCD) for safe motion planning.
Traditional discrete methods potentially miss collisions between these points,
whereas SVCD continuously checks for collisions along the entire trajectory.
Existing SVCD methods typically face a trade-off between efficiency and
accuracy, limiting practical use. In this paper, we introduce NeuralSVCD, a
novel neural encoder-decoder architecture tailored to overcome this trade-off.
Our approach leverages shape locality and temporal locality through distributed

Abstract: Rebar tying is a repetitive but critical task in reinforced concrete
construction, typically performed manually at considerable ergonomic risk.
Recent advances in robotic manipulation hold the potential to automate the
tying process, yet face challenges in accurately estimating tying poses in
congested rebar nodes. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid perception and
motion planning approach that integrates geometry-based perception with
Equivariant Denoising Diffusion on SE(3) (Diffusion-EDFs) to enable robust
multi-node rebar tying with minimal training data. Our perception module
utilizes density-based clustering (DBSCAN), geometry-based node feature
extraction, and principal component analysis (PCA) to segment rebar bars,
identify rebar nodes, and estimate orientation vectors for sequential ranking,
even in complex, unstructured environments. The motion planner, based on
Diffusion-EDFs, is trained on as few as 5-10 demonstrations to generate
sequential end-effector poses that optimize collision avoidance and tying
efficiency. The proposed system is validated on various rebar meshes, including
single-layer, multi-layer, and cluttered configurations, demonstrating high
success rates in node detection and accurate sequential tying. Compared with
conventional approaches that rely on large datasets or extensive manual
parameter tuning, our method achieves robust, efficient, and adaptable
multi-node tying while significantly reducing data requirements. This result
underscores the potential of hybrid perception and diffusion-driven planning to
enhance automation in on-site construction tasks, improving both safety and
labor efficiency.

Abstract: We present Galaxea Open-World Dataset, a large-scale, diverse collection of
robot behaviors recorded in authentic human living and working environments.
All demonstrations are gathered using a consistent robotic embodiment, paired
with precise subtask-level language annotations to facilitate both training and
evaluation. Building on this dataset, we introduce G0, a dual-system framework
that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for multimodal planning with a
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for fine-grained execution. G0 is trained
using a three-stage curriculum: cross-embodiment pre-training,
single-embodiment pre-training, and task-specific post-training. A
comprehensive benchmark spanning tabletop manipulation, few-shot learning, and
long-horizon mobile manipulation, demonstrates the effectiveness of our
approach. In particular, we find that the single-embodiment pre-training stage,
together with the Galaxea Open-World Dataset, plays a critical role in
achieving strong performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are a promising path to realizing
generalist embodied agents that can quickly adapt to new tasks, modalities, and
environments. However, methods for interpreting and steering VLAs fall far
short of classical robotics pipelines, which are grounded in explicit models of
kinematics, dynamics, and control. This lack of mechanistic insight is a
central challenge for deploying learned policies in real-world robotics, where
robustness and explainability are critical. Motivated by advances in
mechanistic interpretability for large language models, we introduce the first
framework for interpreting and steering VLAs via their internal
representations, enabling direct intervention in model behavior at inference
time. We project feedforward activations within transformer layers onto the
token embedding basis, identifying sparse semantic directions - such as speed
and direction - that are causally linked to action selection. Leveraging these
findings, we introduce a general-purpose activation steering method that
modulates behavior in real time, without fine-tuning, reward signals, or
environment interaction. We evaluate this method on two recent open-source
VLAs, Pi0 and OpenVLA, and demonstrate zero-shot behavioral control in
simulation (LIBERO) and on a physical robot (UR5). This work demonstrates that
interpretable components of embodied VLAs can be systematically harnessed for
control - establishing a new paradigm for transparent and steerable foundation
models in robotics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在现有深度学习位姿预测器基础上添加不确定性推理的方法，通过两个额外的多层感知器来估计测量不确定性，提升基于EKF的状态估计性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在机器人感知中广泛应用，但深度神经网络测量的不确定性估计对于概率状态估计器至关重要，需要准确的不确定性信息来指导机器人任务

Method: 在现有DL位姿预测器的平移和旋转部分分别添加两个独立的多层感知器来进行不确定性推理，冻结预训练预测器参数，仅训练不确定性模块，然后将估计的6D位姿和不确定性作为EKF的测量值和噪声协方差

Result: 方法计算开销小，可在边缘设备部署，相比固定协方差方法显著提升了物体相对状态估计的性能，在合成数据和真实数据上均验证了有效性

Conclusion: 提出的不确定性推理方法简单有效，能够动态推断测量不确定性，提高状态估计精度，适用于实际机器人应用

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has become essential in various robotics applications due
to excelling at processing raw sensory data to extract task specific
information from semantic objects. For example, vision-based object-relative
navigation relies on a DL-based 6D object pose predictor to provide the
relative pose between the object and the robot as measurements to the robot's
state estimator. Accurately knowing the uncertainty inherent in such Deep
Neural Network (DNN) based measurements is essential for probabilistic state
estimators subsequently guiding the robot's tasks. Thus, in this letter, we
show that we can extend any existing DL-based object-relative pose predictor
for aleatoric uncertainty inference simply by including two multi-layer
perceptrons detached from the translational and rotational part of the DL
predictor. This allows for efficient training while freezing the existing
pre-trained predictor. We then use the inferred 6D pose and its uncertainty as
a measurement and corresponding noise covariance matrix in an extended Kalman
filter (EKF). Our approach induces minimal computational overhead such that the
state estimator can be deployed on edge devices while benefiting from the
dynamically inferred measurement uncertainty. This increases the performance of
the object-relative state estimation task compared to a fix-covariance
approach. We conduct evaluations on synthetic data and real-world data to
underline the benefits of aleatoric uncertainty inference for the
object-relative state estimation task.

TL;DR: ArtiPoint是一个新颖的框架，通过结合深度点跟踪和因子图优化，从原始RGB-D视频中估计铰接物体模型，在动态相机运动和部分可观测性条件下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有铰接估计方法主要关注受控设置，假设固定相机视角或直接观察不同物体状态，在无约束环境中容易失败。受人类通过观察他人操作物体来推断铰接的启发，需要开发更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 结合深度点跟踪与因子图优化框架，直接从原始RGB-D视频中估计铰接部件轨迹和铰接轴。

Result: 在Arti4D数据集上基准测试显示，ArtiPoint相比经典和学习基线的性能更优越。

Conclusion: ArtiPoint能够有效推断动态相机运动和部分可观测性条件下的铰接物体模型，提出的Arti4D数据集为未来研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Understanding the 3D motion of articulated objects is essential in robotic
scene understanding, mobile manipulation, and motion planning. Prior methods
for articulation estimation have primarily focused on controlled settings,
assuming either fixed camera viewpoints or direct observations of various
object states, which tend to fail in more realistic unconstrained environments.
In contrast, humans effortlessly infer articulation by watching others
manipulate objects. Inspired by this, we introduce ArtiPoint, a novel
estimation framework that can infer articulated object models under dynamic
camera motion and partial observability. By combining deep point tracking with
a factor graph optimization framework, ArtiPoint robustly estimates articulated
part trajectories and articulation axes directly from raw RGB-D videos. To
foster future research in this domain, we introduce Arti4D, the first
ego-centric in-the-wild dataset that captures articulated object interactions
at a scene level, accompanied by articulation labels and ground-truth camera
poses. We benchmark ArtiPoint against a range of classical and learning-based
baselines, demonstrating its superior performance on Arti4D. We make code and
Arti4D publicly available at https://artipoint.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

Motivation: 电影摄影控制需要精确性和艺术性的平衡，传统强化学习方法依赖手工设计的奖励函数和大量调参，限制了创作可用性

Method: 采用学习演示(LfD)方法，通过生成对抗模仿学习(GAIL)从专家遥操作轨迹中学习，实现自动推镜拍摄

Result: GAIL策略在仿真中优于PPO基线，获得更高奖励、更快收敛和更低方差；无需微调即可迁移到真实机器人，比之前的TD3方法具有更一致的构图和主体对齐

Conclusion: LfD为电影领域提供了无需奖励函数的鲁棒替代方案，使创意专业人员能够实现直观、风格化的相机控制，弥合艺术意图与机器人自主性之间的差距

Abstract: Cinematic camera control demands a balance of precision and artistry -
qualities that are difficult to encode through handcrafted reward functions.
While reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to robotic filmmaking, its
reliance on bespoke rewards and extensive tuning limits creative usability. We
propose a Learning from Demonstration (LfD) approach using Generative
Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) to automate dolly-in shots with a
free-roaming, ground-based filming robot. Expert trajectories are collected via
joystick teleoperation in simulation, capturing smooth, expressive motion
without explicit objective design.
  Trained exclusively on these demonstrations, our GAIL policy outperforms a
PPO baseline in simulation, achieving higher rewards, faster convergence, and
lower variance. Crucially, it transfers directly to a real-world robot without
fine-tuning, achieving more consistent framing and subject alignment than a
prior TD3-based method. These results show that LfD offers a robust,
reward-free alternative to RL in cinematic domains, enabling real-time
deployment with minimal technical effort. Our pipeline brings intuitive,
stylized camera control within reach of creative professionals, bridging the
gap between artistic intent and robotic autonomy.

Abstract: Marine ecosystems face increasing pressure due to climate change, driving the
need for scalable, AI-powered monitoring solutions. This paper examines the
rapid emergence of underwater AI as a major research frontier and analyzes the
factors that have transformed marine perception from a niche application into a
catalyst for AI innovation. We identify three convergent drivers: environmental
necessity for ecosystem-scale monitoring, democratization of underwater
datasets through citizen science platforms, and researcher migration from
saturated terrestrial computer vision domains. Our analysis reveals how unique
underwater challenges - turbidity, cryptic species detection, expert annotation
bottlenecks, and cross-ecosystem generalization - are driving fundamental
advances in weakly supervised learning, open-set recognition, and robust
perception under degraded conditions. We survey emerging trends in datasets,
scene understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the paradigm shift from
passive observation toward AI-driven, targeted intervention capabilities. The
paper demonstrates how underwater constraints are pushing the boundaries of
foundation models, self-supervised learning, and perception, with
methodological innovations that extend far beyond marine applications to
benefit general computer vision, robotics, and environmental monitoring.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in autonomous driving systems have
recently demonstrated transformative potential by integrating multimodal
perception with decision-making capabilities. However, the interpretability and
coherence of the decision process and the plausibility of action sequences
remain largely underexplored. To address these issues, we propose
AutoDrive-R$^2$, a novel VLA framework that enhances both reasoning and
self-reflection capabilities of autonomous driving systems through
chain-of-thought (CoT) processing and reinforcement learning (RL).
Specifically, we first propose an innovative CoT dataset named nuScenesR$^2$-6K
for supervised fine-tuning, which effectively builds cognitive bridges between
input information and output trajectories through a four-step logical chain
with self-reflection for validation. Moreover, to maximize both reasoning and
self-reflection during the RL stage, we further employ the Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm within a physics-grounded reward framework
that incorporates spatial alignment, vehicle dynamic, and temporal smoothness
criteria to ensure reliable and realistic trajectory planning. Extensive
evaluation results across both nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrates the
state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization capacity of our proposed
method.

TL;DR: 通过模拟深度摄像头的噪声模型进行数据生成，开发了能够在真实环境中输出准确深度信息的Camera Depth Models，最终实现了从模拟到真实的无缝迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器人操作主要依赖2D视觉观测，但绝绝化能力差；而人类在3D世界中更依赖物理属性如距离、大小和形状。深度摄像头虽可获取3D几何信息，但存在准确性不足和噪声问题。

Method: 提出Camera Depth Models (CDMs)，作为深度摄像头的插件，输入RGB图像和原始深度信号，输出去噪后的准确度量深度。通过建立神经数据引擎，模拟深度摄像头的噪声模式来生成高质量的匹配数据。

Result: CDMs在深度预测中达到了几乎模拟级别的准确性，有效缩小了模拟到真实的差距。在两个具有关节、反射和细长物体的长期限任务中，使用本方法训练的策略能够无缝迁移到真实机器人，性能减少微小或无减少。

Conclusion: 这项研究为利用模拟数据和3D信息来开发通用机器人策略提供了新的可行方向，希望能激励未来更多研究者在这个方向上进行探索。

Abstract: Modern robotic manipulation primarily relies on visual observations in a 2D
color space for skill learning but suffers from poor generalization. In
contrast, humans, living in a 3D world, depend more on physical properties-such
as distance, size, and shape-than on texture when interacting with objects.
Since such 3D geometric information can be acquired from widely available depth
cameras, it appears feasible to endow robots with similar perceptual
capabilities. Our pilot study found that using depth cameras for manipulation
is challenging, primarily due to their limited accuracy and susceptibility to
various types of noise. In this work, we propose Camera Depth Models (CDMs) as
a simple plugin on daily-use depth cameras, which take RGB images and raw depth
signals as input and output denoised, accurate metric depth. To achieve this,
we develop a neural data engine that generates high-quality paired data from
simulation by modeling a depth camera's noise pattern. Our results show that
CDMs achieve nearly simulation-level accuracy in depth prediction, effectively
bridging the sim-to-real gap for manipulation tasks. Notably, our experiments
demonstrate, for the first time, that a policy trained on raw simulated depth,
without the need for adding noise or real-world fine-tuning, generalizes
seamlessly to real-world robots on two challenging long-horizon tasks involving
articulated, reflective, and slender objects, with little to no performance
degradation. We hope our findings will inspire future research in utilizing
simulation data and 3D information in general robot policies.

Conclusion: IWR方法通过考虑数据分布的概率比，有效解决了传统检索方法的问题，为小样本模仿学习提供了更可靠的数据检索机制。

Abstract: While large-scale robot datasets have propelled recent progress in imitation
learning, learning from smaller task specific datasets remains critical for
deployment in new environments and unseen tasks. One such approach to few-shot
imitation learning is retrieval-based imitation learning, which extracts
relevant samples from large, widely available prior datasets to augment a
limited demonstration dataset. To determine the relevant data from prior
datasets, retrieval-based approaches most commonly calculate a prior data
point's minimum distance to a point in the target dataset in latent space.
While retrieval-based methods have shown success using this metric for data
selection, we demonstrate its equivalence to the limit of a Gaussian kernel
density (KDE) estimate of the target data distribution. This reveals two
shortcomings of the retrieval rule used in prior work. First, it relies on
high-variance nearest neighbor estimates that are susceptible to noise. Second,
it does not account for the distribution of prior data when retrieving data. To
address these issues, we introduce Importance Weighted Retrieval (IWR), which
estimates importance weights, or the ratio between the target and prior data
distributions for retrieval, using Gaussian KDEs. By considering the
probability ratio, IWR seeks to mitigate the bias of previous selection rules,
and by using reasonable modeling parameters, IWR effectively smooths estimates
using all data points. Across both simulation environments and real-world
evaluations on the Bridge dataset we find that our method, IWR, consistently
improves performance of existing retrieval-based methods, despite only
requiring minor modifications.

Conclusion: 该框架为增强海上态势感知和防止碰撞提供了可操作的决策支持，通过集成轨迹预测和碰撞风险分析显著提升了海事安全性。

Abstract: Accurate vessel trajectory prediction is essential for enhancing situational
awareness and preventing collisions. Still, existing data-driven models are
constrained mainly to single-vessel forecasting, overlooking vessel
interactions, navigation rules, and explicit collision risk assessment. We
present a transformer-based framework for multi-vessel trajectory prediction
with integrated collision risk analysis. For a given target vessel, the
framework identifies nearby vessels. It jointly predicts their future
trajectories through parallel streams encoding kinematic and derived physical
features, causal convolutions for temporal locality, spatial transformations
for positional encoding, and hybrid positional embeddings that capture both
local motion patterns and long-range dependencies. Evaluated on large-scale
real-world AIS data using joint multi-vessel metrics, the model demonstrates
superior forecasting capabilities beyond traditional single-vessel displacement
errors. By simulating interactions among predicted trajectories, the framework
further quantifies potential collision risks, offering actionable insights to
strengthen maritime safety and decision support.

Conclusion: 该约束解码方法为机器人基础模型提供了可证明的安全保证，是提升数据驱动模型安全性的有效途径。

Abstract: Recent advances in the development of robotic foundation models have led to
promising end-to-end and general-purpose capabilities in robotic systems. These
models are pretrained on vast datasets of robot trajectories to process multi-
modal inputs and directly output a sequence of action that the system then
executes in the real world. Although this approach is attractive from the
perspective of im- proved generalization across diverse tasks, these models are
still data-driven and, therefore, lack explicit notions of behavioral
correctness and safety constraints. We address these limitations by introducing
a constrained decoding framework for robotics foundation models that enforces
logical constraints on action trajec- tories in dynamical systems. Our method
ensures that generated actions provably satisfy signal temporal logic (STL)
specifications at runtime without retraining, while remaining agnostic of the
underlying foundation model. We perform com- prehensive evaluation of our
approach across state-of-the-art navigation founda- tion models and we show
that our decoding-time interventions are useful not only for filtering unsafe
actions but also for conditional action-generation. Videos available on our

Conclusion: ATE提供了一个通用且轻量级的解决方案，大大增强了VLA模型部署到新机器人平台和任务的实用性

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models pre-trained on large, diverse datasets
show remarkable potential for general-purpose robotic manipulation. However, a
primary bottleneck remains in adapting these models to downstream tasks,
especially when the robot's embodiment or the task itself differs from the
pre-training data. This discrepancy leads to a significant mismatch in action
distributions, demanding extensive data and compute for effective fine-tuning.
To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{Align-Then-stEer
(\texttt{ATE})}, a novel, data-efficient, and plug-and-play adaptation
framework. \texttt{ATE} first aligns disparate action spaces by constructing a
unified latent space, where a variational autoencoder constrained by reverse KL
divergence embeds adaptation actions into modes of the pre-training action
latent distribution. Subsequently, it steers the diffusion- or flow-based VLA's
generation process during fine-tuning via a guidance mechanism that pushes the
model's output distribution towards the target domain. We conduct extensive
experiments on cross-embodiment and cross-task manipulation in both simulation
and real world. Compared to direct fine-tuning of representative VLAs, our
method improves the average multi-task success rate by up to \textbf{9.8\%} in
simulation and achieves a striking \textbf{32\% success rate gain} in a
real-world cross-embodiment setting. Our work presents a general and
lightweight solution that greatly enhances the practicality of deploying VLA
models to new robotic platforms and tasks.

Abstract: Social robotic navigation has been at the center of numerous studies in
recent years. Most of the research has focused on driving the robotic agent
along obstacle-free trajectories, respecting social distances from humans, and
predicting their movements to optimize navigation. However, in order to really
be socially accepted, the robots must be able to attain certain social norms
that cannot arise from conventional navigation, but require a dedicated
learning process. We propose Heuristic Planning with Learned Social Value
(HPLSV), a method to learn a value function encapsulating the cost of social
navigation, and use it as an additional heuristic in heuristic-search path
planning. In this preliminary work, we apply the methodology to the common
social scenario of joining a queue of people, with the intention of
generalizing to further human activities.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Accurate determination of total oxidant concentration ([Ox]_{tot}) in
non-thermal plasma (NTP)-treated aqueous systems remains a critical challenge
due to the transient nature of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and the
subjectivity of conventional titration methods used for [Ox]_{tot}
determination. This study introduces a novel, color-based computer analysis
(CBCA) method that integrates advanced image processing with machine learning
(ML) to quantify colorimetric shifts in potassium iodide (KI) solutions during
oxidation. First, a custom-built visual data acquisition system captured
high-resolution video of the color transitions in a KI solution during
oxidation with an NTP system. The change in [Ox]_{tot} during the experiments
was monitored with a standard titrimetric method. Second, the captured frames
were processed using a robust image processing pipeline to extract RGB, HSV,
and Lab color features. The extracted features were statistically evaluated,
and the results revealed strong linear correlations with the measured
[Ox]_{tot} values, particularly in the saturation (HSV), a and b (Lab), and
blue (RGB) channels. Subsequently, the [Ox]_{tot} measurements and the
extracted color features were used to train and validate five ML models. Among
them, linear regression and gradient boosting models achieved the highest
predictive accuracy (R^2 > 0.990). It was also found that reducing the feature
set from nine to four resulted in comparable performance with improved
prediction efficiency, especially for gradient boosting. Finally, comparison of
the model predictions with real titration measurements revealed that the CBCA
system successfully predicts the [Ox]_{tot} in KI solution with high accuracy
(R^2 > 0.998) even with a reduced number of features.

Method: 使用Gemini 2.5 Pro全能模型与专业深度学习模型在肠息机性肌肉、视网膜血管和乳腺肿瘤分割任务中进行零样本性能对比，并根据专业模型的准确率筛选出"最简单"和"最困难"的案例子集进行极端性能分析。

Result: 结果显示任务依赖性差异：在肠息机性肌肉和乳腺肿瘤分割中，专业模型在简单案例中表现更好，但全能模型在复杂案例中更健壮；在细粒度的视网膜血管分割中，专业模型在所有案例中都保持优势。定性分析还发现全能模型可能具有更高的敏感性。

Conclusion: 当前全能模型还无法全面取代专业模型，但其在复杂边缘案例中的健壮性优势表明它们可能与专业模型形成补充关系，特别是在处理具有挑战性的难题时。

Abstract: The emergence of powerful, general-purpose omnimodels capable of processing
diverse data modalities has raised a critical question: can these
``jack-of-all-trades'' systems perform on par with highly specialized models in
knowledge-intensive domains? This work investigates this question within the
high-stakes field of medical image segmentation. We conduct a comparative study
analyzing the zero-shot performance of a state-of-the-art omnimodel (Gemini 2.5
Pro, the ``Nano Banana'' model) against domain-specific deep learning models on
three distinct tasks: polyp (endoscopy), retinal vessel (fundus), and breast
tumor segmentation (ultrasound). Our study focuses on performance at the
extremes by curating subsets of the ``easiest'' and ``hardest'' cases based on
the specialist models' accuracy. Our findings reveal a nuanced and
task-dependent landscape. For polyp and breast tumor segmentation, specialist
models excel on easy samples, but the omnimodel demonstrates greater robustness
on hard samples where specialists fail catastrophically. Conversely, for the
fine-grained task of retinal vessel segmentation, the specialist model
maintains superior performance across both easy and hard cases. Intriguingly,
qualitative analysis suggests omnimodels may possess higher sensitivity,
identifying subtle anatomical features missed by human annotators. Our results
indicate that while current omnimodels are not yet a universal replacement for
specialists, their unique strengths suggest a potential complementary role with
specialist models, particularly in enhancing robustness on challenging edge
cases.

Motivation: 解决纵向全身CT图像中病灶自动分割和跨时间追踪的挑战，特别是如何利用纵向信息和交互式提示来提升病灶追踪的稳定性

Method: 扩展LongiSeg框架使其具备提示功能（点和掩码交互），并利用大规模合成纵向CT数据集进行预训练以克服训练数据有限的问题

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of lesions in longitudinal whole-body CT is essential
for monitoring disease progression and treatment response. While automated
methods benefit from incorporating longitudinal information, they remain
limited in their ability to consistently track individual lesions across time.
Task 2 of the autoPET/CT IV Challenge addresses this by providing lesion
localizations and baseline delineations, framing the problem as longitudinal
promptable segmentation. In this work, we extend the recently proposed LongiSeg
framework with promptable capabilities, enabling lesion-specific tracking
through point and mask interactions. To address the limited size of the
provided training set, we leverage large-scale pretraining on a synthetic
longitudinal CT dataset. Our experiments show that pretraining substantially
improves the ability to exploit longitudinal context, yielding an improvement
of up to 6 Dice points compared to models trained from scratch. These findings
demonstrate the effectiveness of combining longitudinal context with
interactive prompting for robust lesion tracking. Code is publicly available at

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide,
necessitating early detection to prevent vision loss. Current automated DR
detection systems often struggle with poor-quality images, lack
interpretability, and insufficient integration of domain-specific knowledge. To
address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that integrates three
innovative contributions: (1) Adaptive Retinal Image Enhancement Using
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs): this technique dynamically enhances
retinal images by incorporating physical constraints, improving the visibility
of critical features such as microaneurysms, hemorrhages, and exudates; (2)
Hybrid Feature Fusion Network (HFFN): by combining deep learning embeddings
with handcrafted features, HFFN leverages both learned representations and
domain-specific knowledge to enhance generalization and accuracy; (3)
Multi-Stage Classifier with Uncertainty Quantification: this method breaks down
the classification process into logical stages, providing interpretable
predictions and confidence scores, thereby improving clinical trust. The
proposed framework achieves an accuracy of 92.7%, a precision of 92.5%, a
recall of 92.6%, an F1-score of 92.5%, an AUC of 97.8%, a mAP of 0.96, and an
MCC of 0.85. Ophthalmologists rated the framework's predictions as highly
clinically relevant (4.8/5), highlighting its alignment with real-world
diagnostic needs. Qualitative analyses, including Grad-CAM visualizations and
uncertainty heatmaps, further enhance the interpretability and trustworthiness
of the system. The framework demonstrates robust performance across diverse
conditions, including low-quality images, noisy data, and unseen datasets.
These features make the proposed framework a promising tool for clinical
adoption, enabling more accurate and reliable DR detection in resource-limited
settings.

Motivation: 现有乳腺癌风险预测模型性能有限且未整合数字乳腺断层合成（DBT）影像技术，而早期检测对治疗成功至关重要

Method: 使用Meta AI DINOv2图像编码器提取特征，结合累积风险层，在161,753例DBT检查数据上训练5年风险预测模型

Result: 在测试集上，最佳模型在5年预测期内实现了0.80的AUROC，显示出优异的预测性能

Conclusion: DBT基础的深度学习方法具有巨大潜力，可作为传统风险评估工具的有力补充，为后续验证和优化研究奠定基础

Abstract: As early detection of breast cancer strongly favors successful therapeutic
outcomes, there is major commercial interest in optimizing breast cancer
screening. However, current risk prediction models achieve modest performance
and do not incorporate digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) imaging, which was
FDA-approved for breast cancer screening in 2011. To address this unmet need,
we present a deep learning (DL)-based framework capable of forecasting an
individual patient's 5-year breast cancer risk directly from screening DBT.
Using an unparalleled dataset of 161,753 DBT examinations from 50,590 patients,
we trained a risk predictor based on features extracted using the Meta AI
DINOv2 image encoder, combined with a cumulative hazard layer, to assess a
patient's likelihood of developing breast cancer over five years. On a held-out
test set, our best-performing model achieved an AUROC of 0.80 on predictions
within 5 years. These findings reveal the high potential of DBT-based DL
approaches to complement traditional risk assessment tools, and serve as a
promising basis for additional investigation to validate and enhance our work.

Abstract: To develop and externally validate integrated ultrasound nomograms combining
BIRADS features and quantitative morphometric characteristics, and to compare
their performance with expert radiologists and state of the art large language
models in biopsy recommendation and malignancy prediction for breast lesions.
In this retrospective multicenter, multinational study, 1747 women with
pathologically confirmed breast lesions underwent ultrasound across three
centers in Iran and Turkey. A total of 10 BIRADS and 26 morphological features
were extracted from each lesion. A BIRADS, morphometric, and fused nomogram
integrating both feature sets was constructed via logistic regression. Three
radiologists (one senior, two general) and two ChatGPT variants independently
interpreted deidentified breast lesion images. Diagnostic performance for
biopsy recommendation (BIRADS 4,5) and malignancy prediction was assessed in
internal and two external validation cohorts. In pooled analysis, the fused
nomogram achieved the highest accuracy for biopsy recommendation (83.0%) and
malignancy prediction (83.8%), outperforming the morphometric nomogram, three
radiologists and both ChatGPT models. Its AUCs were 0.901 and 0.853 for the two
tasks, respectively. In addition, the performance of the BIRADS nomogram was
significantly higher than the morphometric nomogram, three radiologists and
both ChatGPT models for biopsy recommendation and malignancy prediction.
External validation confirmed the robust generalizability across different
ultrasound platforms and populations. An integrated BIRADS morphometric
nomogram consistently outperforms standalone models, LLMs, and radiologists in
guiding biopsy decisions and predicting malignancy. These interpretable,
externally validated tools have the potential to reduce unnecessary biopsies
and enhance personalized decision making in breast imaging.

Abstract: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a
pivotal tool for revealing intrinsic brain network connectivity and identifying
neural biomarkers of neuropsychiatric conditions. However, classical
self-attention transformer models--despite their formidable representational
power--struggle with quadratic complexity, large parameter counts, and
substantial data requirements. To address these barriers, we introduce a
Quantum Time-series Transformer, a novel quantum-enhanced transformer
architecture leveraging Linear Combination of Unitaries and Quantum Singular
Value Transformation. Unlike classical transformers, Quantum Time-series
Transformer operates with polylogarithmic computational complexity, markedly
reducing training overhead and enabling robust performance even with fewer
parameters and limited sample sizes. Empirical evaluation on the largest-scale
fMRI datasets from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study and the UK
Biobank demonstrates that Quantum Time-series Transformer achieves comparable
or superior predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art classical
transformer models, with especially pronounced gains in small-sample scenarios.
Interpretability analyses using SHapley Additive exPlanations further reveal
that Quantum Time-series Transformer reliably identifies clinically meaningful
neural biomarkers of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These
findings underscore the promise of quantum-enhanced transformers in advancing
computational neuroscience by more efficiently modeling complex spatio-temporal
dynamics and improving clinical interpretability.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging is a critical tool in medical diagnostics, offering
real-time visualization of physiological processes. One of its major advantages
is its ability to capture temporal dynamics, which is essential for assessing
motion patterns in applications such as cardiac monitoring, fetal development,
and vascular imaging. Despite its importance, current deep learning models
often overlook the temporal continuity of ultrasound sequences, analyzing
frames independently and missing key temporal dependencies. To address this
gap, we propose a method for learning effective temporal representations from
ultrasound videos, with a focus on echocardiography-based ejection fraction
(EF) estimation. EF prediction serves as an ideal case study to demonstrate the
necessity of temporal learning, as it requires capturing the rhythmic
contraction and relaxation of the heart. Our approach leverages temporally
consistent masking and contrastive learning to enforce temporal coherence
across video frames, enhancing the model's ability to represent motion
patterns. Evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, our method achieves a
substantial improvement in EF prediction accuracy, highlighting the importance
of temporally-aware representation learning for real-time ultrasound analysis.

Conclusion: 提出的形式化框架为系统设计提供了同时满足可解释性和隐私保护的理论基础和实践工具。

Abstract: Explainable systems expose information about why certain observed effects are
happening to the agents interacting with them. We argue that this constitutes a
positive flow of information that needs to be specified, verified, and balanced
against negative information flow that may, e.g., violate privacy guarantees.
Since both explainability and privacy require reasoning about knowledge, we
tackle these tasks with epistemic temporal logic extended with quantification
over counterfactual causes. This allows us to specify that a multi-agent system
exposes enough information such that agents acquire knowledge on why some
effect occurred. We show how this principle can be used to specify
explainability as a system-level requirement and provide an algorithm for
checking finite-state models against such specifications. We present a
prototype implementation of the algorithm and evaluate it on several
benchmarks, illustrating how our approach distinguishes between explainable and
unexplainable systems, and how it allows to pose additional privacy
requirements.

Abstract: The stability rule for belief, advocated by Leitgeb [Annals of Pure and
Applied Logic 164, 2013], is a rule for rational acceptance that captures
categorical belief in terms of $\textit{probabilistically stable
propositions}$: propositions to which the agent assigns resiliently high
credence. The stability rule generates a class of $\textit{probabilistically
stable belief revision}$ operators, which capture the dynamics of belief that
result from an agent updating their credences through Bayesian conditioning
while complying with the stability rule for their all-or-nothing beliefs. In
this paper, we prove a representation theorem that yields a complete
characterisation of such probabilistically stable revision operators and
provides a `qualitative' selection function semantics for the (non-monotonic)
logic of probabilistically stable belief revision. Drawing on the theory of
comparative probability orders, this result gives necessary and sufficient
conditions for a selection function to be representable as a
strongest-stable-set operator on a finite probability space. The resulting
logic of probabilistically stable belief revision exhibits strong monotonicity
properties while failing the AGM belief revision postulates and satisfying only
very weak forms of case reasoning. In showing the main theorem, we prove two
results of independent interest to the theory of comparative probability: the
first provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the joint representation
of a pair of (respectively, strict and non-strict) comparative probability
orders. The second result provides a method for axiomatising the logic of ratio
comparisons of the form ``event $A$ is at least $k$ times more likely than
event $B$''. In addition to these measurement-theoretic applications, we point
out two applications of our main result to the theory of simple voting games
and to revealed preference theory.

Abstract: Foundation models trained as autoregressive PDE surrogates hold significant
promise for accelerating scientific discovery through their capacity to both
extrapolate beyond training regimes and efficiently adapt to downstream tasks
despite a paucity of examples for fine-tuning. However, reliably achieving
genuine generalization - a necessary capability for producing novel scientific
insights and robustly performing during deployment - remains a critical
challenge. Establishing whether or not these requirements are met demands
evaluation metrics capable of clearly distinguishing genuine model
generalization from mere memorization.
  We apply the influence function formalism to systematically characterize how
autoregressive PDE surrogates assimilate and propagate information derived from
diverse physical scenarios, revealing fundamental limitations of standard
models and training routines in addition to providing actionable insights
regarding the design of improved surrogates.

We propose two novel pipelines for automatically generating music videos from

learning models. Inspired by the manual workflows of music video producers, we
experiment on how well latent feature-based techniques can analyse audio to
detect musical qualities, such as emotional cues and instrumental patterns, and
distil them into textual scene descriptions using a language model. Next, we
employ a generative model to produce the corresponding video clips. To assess
the generated videos, we identify several critical aspects and design and
conduct a preliminary user evaluation that demonstrates storytelling potential,
visual coherency and emotional alignment with the music. Our findings
underscore the potential of latent feature techniques and deep generative
models to expand music visualisation beyond traditional approaches.

generation easy, making speech-based services vulnerable to spoofing attacks.
Consequently, there is a dire need for robust countermeasures more than ever.
Existing solutions for deepfake detection are often criticized for lacking
generalizability and fail drastically when applied to real-world data. This
study proposes a novel method for generalizable spoofing detection leveraging
non-semantic universal audio representations. Extensive experiments have been
performed to find suitable non-semantic features using TRILL and TRILLsson
models. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves comparable
performance on the in-domain test set while significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art approaches on out-of-domain test sets. Notably, it
demonstrates superior generalization on public-domain data, surpassing methods
based on hand-crafted features, semantic embeddings, and end-to-end
architectures.

Motivation: 阿拉伯语等低资源语言在语音情感识别方面面临数据有限和研究不足的挑战，需要高效且性能优异的解决方案。

Method: 使用Mel频谱图而非传统MFCC特征，通过2D卷积处理来保留细微的频谱-时间模式，避免传统方法中情感线索的丢失。

Result: ArabEmoNet在参数规模仅为HuBERT base的1/90和Whisper的1/74的情况下，实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该架构显著推进了阿拉伯语语音情感识别技术，为实际应用提供了卓越性能和可访问性。

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition is vital for human-computer interaction,
particularly for low-resource languages like Arabic, which face challenges due
to limited data and research. We introduce ArabEmoNet, a lightweight
architecture designed to overcome these limitations and deliver
state-of-the-art performance. Unlike previous systems relying on discrete MFCC
features and 1D convolutions, which miss nuanced spectro-temporal patterns,

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 一种简化的单阶段量化语音编码方法，通过对mel谱图进行4x4补丁量化，在7.5 kbits/s码率下达到竞争性的感知质量和可懂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统复杂的殊向量量化(RVQ)堆栈，寻求更简单、低延迟的语音编码方案。

Method: 直接在mel谱图上进行非重叠4x4补丁量化，使用单一共享码本；采用晚期对抗精调VQ-VAE，并从头训练HiFi-GAN语音合成器。

Result: 在7.5 kbits/s码率下，STOI、PESQ、MCD和ViSQOL等指标表现竞争力，达到了与最先进网络编码相当的感知质量和可懂性。

Conclusion: 证明了简化的非殊向量量化架构的有效性，为未来低延迟编码设计提供了良好的开放基础。

Abstract: We present a neural speech codec that challenges the need for complex
residual vector quantization (RVQ) stacks by introducing a simpler,
single-stage quantization approach. Our method operates directly on the
mel-spectrogram, treating it as a 2D data and quantizing non-overlapping 4x4
patches into a single, shared codebook. This patchwise design simplifies the
architecture, enables low-latency streaming, and yields a discrete latent grid.
To ensure high-fidelity synthesis, we employ a late-stage adversarial
fine-tuning for the VQ-VAE and train a HiFi-GAN vocoder from scratch on the
codec's reconstructed spectrograms. Operating at approximately 7.5 kbits/s for
16 kHz speech, our system was evaluated against several state-of-the-art neural
codecs using objective metrics such as STOI, PESQ, MCD, and ViSQOL. The results
demonstrate that our simplified, non-residual architecture achieves competitive
perceptual quality and intelligibility, validating it as an effective and open
foundation for future low-latency codec designs.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的全双工对话模型FLM-Audio，通过模仿人类认知行为的"自然"独白和双重训练方式，解决了音频流与文本对齐的挑战，实现了更优的响应速度和对话体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有全双工对话模型遇到的关键挑战是文本独白与不同比特率音频流的对齐问题。传统的单词级对齐方法会降低大型预训练模型的语言能力，且需要高精度的时间戳，导致累积错误和高处理成本。

Method: 提出了"自然"独白的连续token序列方法，模仿人类对话认知行为。在不同训练阶段交替将自然独白放置在音频的前置或后置位置，构建了双重训练范式。基于此方法构建了7B发声对话模型FLM-Audio。

Result: FLM-Audio模型在实验中表现出优异的响应性能、全双工能力和聊天体验，验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过模仿人类认知的"自然"独白方法和双重训练范式，成功解决了音频流与文本对齐的挑战，构建了高性能的全双工对话模型，为语音对话系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Full-duplex dialog models are designed to listen and speak simultaneously
with rapid responses to fast-changing user input. Among existing approaches,
native full-duplex models merges different channels (e.g. listen and speak) in
a single time step, overcoming the high response latency inherent to
time-division multiplexing time-division multiplexing (TDM) alternatives. Yet,
a key challenge remains: aligning textual monologues with audio streams that
operate at different bitrates. The prevailing solution relies on word-level
alignment, but this can degrade the language ability of large pre-trained
models. Moreover, it requires highly accurate timestamps for every token, which
introduces cascading errors and increases pre-processing costs. In this paper,
we propose textual monologues in continuous tokens sequence, namely "natural"
monologues, which mimics humanoid cognitive behavior in dialogs. For temporal
alignment, we alternate the position of the natural monologue - leading or
trailing the audio - across different training stages. This "dual" training
paradigm proves highly effective in building FLM-Audio, our 7B spoken dialog
model that demonstrates superior responsiveness, duplexity, and chatting
experiences, as confirmed by experimental results.

*Ashwin Nagarajan,Hao-Wen Dong*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 研究表明，即使不使用艺术家姓名，通过大语言模型生成的描述符也能有效控制音乐生成风格，现有基于姓名限制的政策保护措施可能不足以防止风格模仿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到音乐模型在细粒度风格控制方面存在挑战，需要重新训练或专门条件设置，这限制了可重复性和政策合规性。研究旨在探索轻量级、人类可读的描述符是否能提供政策稳健的风格控制替代方案。

Method: 使用MusicGen-small模型，评估Billie Eilish和Ludovico Einaudi两位艺术家的风格控制。通过大语言模型生成三种提示条件：基线提示、艺术家姓名提示和五组描述符集。使用VGGish和CLAP嵌入进行评估，包括分布相似性和每片段相似性度量。

Result: 艺术家姓名是最强的控制信号，但无姓名描述符能恢复大部分效果。跨艺术家转移降低了对齐性，表明描述符编码了目标风格线索。研究还提供了十位当代艺术家的描述符表。

Conclusion: 研究发现存在"无姓名差距"，即艺术家姓名提示与政策合规描述符之间的可控性差异，提出了可重复的提示级可控性评估协议，表明现有姓名限制政策可能无法完全防止风格模仿。

Abstract: Text-to-music models capture broad attributes such as instrumentation or
mood, but fine-grained stylistic control remains an open challenge. Existing
stylization methods typically require retraining or specialized conditioning,
which complicates reproducibility and limits policy compliance when artist
names are restricted. We study whether lightweight, human-readable modifiers
sampled from a large language model can provide a policy-robust alternative for
stylistic control. Using MusicGen-small, we evaluate two artists: Billie Eilish
(vocal pop) and Ludovico Einaudi (instrumental piano). For each artist, we use
fifteen reference excerpts and evaluate matched seeds under three conditions:
baseline prompts, artist-name prompts, and five descriptor sets. All prompts
are generated using a large language model. Evaluation uses both VGGish and
CLAP embeddings with distributional and per-clip similarity measures, including
a new min-distance attribution metric. Results show that artist names are the
strongest control signal across both artists, while name-free descriptors
recover much of this effect. This highlights that existing safeguards such as
the restriction of artist names in music generation prompts may not fully
prevent style imitation. Cross-artist transfers reduce alignment, showing that
descriptors encode targeted stylistic cues. We also present a descriptor table
across ten contemporary artists to illustrate the breadth of the tokens.
Together these findings define the name-free gap, the controllability
difference between artist-name prompts and policy-compliant descriptors, shown
through a reproducible evaluation protocol for prompt-level controllability.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了AImoclips基准测试，用于评估文本到音乐生成系统在情感传达方面的表现，发现商业系统倾向于生成比预期更愉悦的音乐，而开源系统则相反，所有系统都存在情感中性偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到音乐生成系统在情感保真度方面研究不足，需要系统评估这些系统如何向人类听众传达预期情感。

Method: 选择12种涵盖效价-唤醒空间四个象限的情感意图，使用6个最先进的TTM系统生成1000多个音乐片段，111名参与者在9点李克特量表上评估感知效价和唤醒度。

Result: 商业系统倾向于生成比预期更愉悦的音乐，开源系统则相反；高唤醒条件下情感传达更准确；所有系统都存在情感中性偏差。

Conclusion: 该基准测试提供了模型特定情感渲染特征的有价值见解，支持未来开发情感对齐的TTM系统，揭示了情感可控性的关键限制。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-music (TTM) generation have enabled controllable
and expressive music creation using natural language prompts. However, the
emotional fidelity of TTM systems remains largely underexplored compared to
human preference or text alignment. In this study, we introduce AImoclips, a
benchmark for evaluating how well TTM systems convey intended emotions to human
listeners, covering both open-source and commercial models. We selected 12
emotion intents spanning four quadrants of the valence-arousal space, and used
six state-of-the-art TTM systems to generate over 1,000 music clips. A total of
111 participants rated the perceived valence and arousal of each clip on a
9-point Likert scale. Our results show that commercial systems tend to produce
music perceived as more pleasant than intended, while open-source systems tend
to perform the opposite. Emotions are more accurately conveyed under
high-arousal conditions across all models. Additionally, all systems exhibit a
bias toward emotional neutrality, highlighting a key limitation in affective
controllability. This benchmark offers valuable insights into model-specific
emotion rendering characteristics and supports future development of
emotionally aligned TTM systems.

Motivation: 交通拥堵是紧迫的城市挑战，需要智能交通系统进行实时管理。传统方法在准确性和处理效率方面存在不足，特别是在异构城市环境中。

Method: 采用混合框架：双分支BMCNN处理MFCC和小波特征以捕获互补频率模式；注意力增强的DQN自适应选择最少音频帧数并在达到置信度阈值时触发早期决策。

Result: 在IDMT-Traffic和SZUR-Acoustic数据集上分别达到95.99%和92.3%的准确率，通过早期终止实现平均处理速度提升1.63倍。相比A3C、DDDQN等方法，在准确性和效率方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法为异构城市环境中的实时智能交通系统部署提供了优越的准确性和效率权衡，适合实际应用。

Abstract: Traffic congestion remains a pressing urban challenge, requiring intelligent
transportation systems for real-time management. We present a hybrid framework
that combines deep learning and reinforcement learning for acoustic vehicle
speed classification. A dual-branch BMCNN processes MFCC and wavelet features
to capture complementary frequency patterns. An attention-enhanced DQN
adaptively selects the minimal number of audio frames and triggers early
decisions once confidence thresholds are reached. Evaluations on IDMT-Traffic
and our SZUR-Acoustic (Suzhou) datasets show 95.99% and 92.3% accuracy, with up
to 1.63x faster average processing via early termination. Compared with A3C,
DDDQN, SA2C, PPO, and TD3, the method provides a superior accuracy-efficiency
trade-off and is suitable for real-time ITS deployment in heterogeneous urban
environments.

Conclusion: 完整流水线可在严格内存和计算限制下实现可靠的设备端语音命令识别，适用于电池供电IoT节点、无线传感器网络和免提控制接口

Abstract: This paper presents a low-resource speech-command recognizer combining
energy-based voice activity detection (VAD), an optimized Mel-Frequency
Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) pipeline, and the LogNNet reservoir-computing
classifier. Using four commands from the Speech Commands da-taset downsampled
to 8 kHz, we evaluate four MFCC aggregation schemes and find that adaptive
binning (64-dimensional feature vector) offers the best accuracy-to-compactness
trade-off. The LogNNet classifier with architecture 64:33:9:4 reaches 92.04%
accuracy under speaker-independent evaluation, while requiring significantly
fewer parameters than conventional deep learn-ing models. Hardware
implementation on Arduino Nano 33 IoT (ARM Cor-tex-M0+, 48 MHz, 32 KB RAM)
validates the practical feasibility, achieving ~90% real-time recognition
accuracy while consuming only 18 KB RAM (55% utilization). The complete
pipeline (VAD -> MFCC -> LogNNet) thus enables reliable on-device
speech-command recognition under strict memory and compute limits, making it
suitable for battery-powered IoT nodes, wire-less sensor networks, and
hands-free control interfaces.

Abstract: The success of the generative model has gained unprecedented attention in the
music generation area. Transformer-based architectures have set new benchmarks
for model performance. However, their practical adoption is hindered by some
critical challenges: the demand for massive computational resources and
inference time, due to their large number of parameters. These obstacles make
them infeasible to deploy on edge devices, such as smartphones and wearables,
with limited computational resources. In this work, we present TinyMusician, a
lightweight music generation model distilled from MusicGen (a State-of-the-art
music generation model). TinyMusician integrates two innovations: (i)
Stage-mixed Bidirectional and Skewed KL-Divergence and (ii) Adaptive
Mixed-Precision Quantization. The experimental results demonstrate that
TinyMusician retains 93% of the MusicGen-Small performance with 55% less model

Motivation: 现有呼吸音事件检测方法存在三个主要问题：依赖帧级预测和后处理导致区间边界难以直接学习；只能处理固定长度音频；呼吸音位置信息影响未得到充分研究。

Method: 提出基于图神经网络的框架，使用锚点区间来处理变长音频，能够提供更精确的时间定位。同时考虑呼吸音位置信息来增强异常音的识别能力。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的方法有效解决了现有呼吸音检测方法的限制，提高了检测的灵活性和应用性，为呼吸系统疾病的早期诊断提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: Auscultation is a key method for early diagnosis of respiratory and pulmonary
diseases, relying on skilled healthcare professionals. However, the process is
often subjective, with variability between experts. As a result, numerous deep
learning-based automatic classification methods have emerged, most of which
focus on respiratory sound classification. In contrast, research on respiratory
sound event detection remains limited. Existing sound event detection methods
typically rely on frame-level predictions followed by post-processing to
generate event-level outputs, making interval boundaries challenging to learn
directly. Furthermore, many approaches can only handle fixed-length audio, lim-
iting their applicability to variable-length respiratory sounds. Additionally,
the impact of respiratory sound location information on detection performance
has not been extensively explored. To address these issues, we propose a graph
neural network-based framework with anchor intervals, capable of handling
variable-length audio and providing more precise temporal localization for
abnormal respi- ratory sound events. Our method improves both the flexibility
and applicability of respiratory sound detection. Experiments on the SPRSound
2024 and HF Lung V1 datasets demonstrate the effec- tiveness of the proposed
approach, and incorporating respiratory position information enhances the
discrimination between abnormal sounds.

Abstract: Separating overlapping speech from multiple speakers is crucial for effective
human-vehicle interaction. This paper proposes CabinSep, a lightweight neural
mask-based minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) speech separation
approach, to reduce speech recognition errors in back-end automatic speech
recognition (ASR) models. Our contributions are threefold: First, we utilize
channel information to extract spatial features, which improves the estimation
of speech and noise masks. Second, we employ MVDR during inference, reducing
speech distortion to make it more ASR-friendly. Third, we introduce a data
augmentation method combining simulated and real-recorded impulse responses
(IRs), improving speaker localization at zone boundaries and further reducing
speech recognition errors. With a computational complexity of only 0.4 GMACs,
CabinSep achieves a 17.5% relative reduction in speech recognition error rate
in a real-recorded dataset compared to the state-of-the-art DualSep model.

Abstract: Audio Chord Estimation (ACE) holds a pivotal role in music information
research, having garnered attention for over two decades due to its relevance
for music transcription and analysis. Despite notable advancements, challenges
persist in the task, particularly concerning unique characteristics of harmonic
content, which have resulted in existing systems' performances reaching a glass
ceiling. These challenges include annotator subjectivity, where varying
interpretations among annotators lead to inconsistencies, and class imbalance
within chord datasets, where certain chord classes are over-represented
compared to others, posing difficulties in model training and evaluation. As a
first contribution, this paper presents an evaluation of inter-annotator
agreement in chord annotations, using metrics that extend beyond traditional
binary measures. In addition, we propose a consonance-informed distance metric
that reflects the perceptual similarity between harmonic annotations. Our
analysis suggests that consonance-based distance metrics more effectively
capture musically meaningful agreement between annotations. Expanding on these
findings, we introduce a novel ACE conformer-based model that integrates
consonance concepts into the model through consonance-based label smoothing.
The proposed model also addresses class imbalance by separately estimating
root, bass, and all note activations, enabling the reconstruction of chord
labels from decomposed outputs.

Motivation: 评估传统机器学习方法与深度学习方法在音乐类型分类任务上的表现，以了解不同方法在实际应用中的优势和局限性。

Method: 使用GTZAN数据集，对比了支持向量机(SVM)和集成方法等传统分类器(基于手工特征工程)与卷积神经网络(CNN)模型(基于Mel谱图)的性能。

Result: 结果显示SVM在分类准确率方面表现更优，超过了CNN模型。这是因为在数据量有限的情况下，领域特定的特征工程提供了强烈的归纳偏置，有效减少了深度学习模型的过拟合风险。

Conclusion: 这项研究突出了传统特征提取方法在实际音频处理任务中的持久价值，并为深度学习的普遍适用性提供了重要视角，尤其是在数据集规模中等的情况下。

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of machine learning methodologies
for automatic music genre classification. We evaluate the performance of
classical classifiers, including Support Vector Machines (SVM) and ensemble
methods, trained on a comprehensive set of hand-crafted audio features, against
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) operating on Mel spectrograms. The study
is conducted on the widely-used GTZAN dataset. Our findings demonstrate a
noteworthy result: the SVM, leveraging domain-specific feature engineering,
achieves superior classification accuracy compared to the end-to-end CNN model.
We attribute this outcome to the data-constrained nature of the benchmark
dataset, where the strong inductive bias of engineered features provides a
regularization effect that mitigates the risk of overfitting inherent in
high-capacity deep learning models. This work underscores the enduring
relevance of traditional feature extraction in practical audio processing tasks
and provides a critical perspective on the universal applicability of deep
learning, especially for moderately sized datasets.

Conclusion: 该研究为音频tokenization提供了理论基础和系统性评估方法，有助于推动多模态大语言模型在音频处理领域的发展。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been widely applied in speech
and music. This tendency has led to a focus on audio tokenization for Large
Models (LMs). Unlike semantic-only text tokens, audio tokens must both capture
global semantic content and preserve fine-grained acoustic details. Moreover,
they provide a discrete method for speech and music that can be effectively
integrated into MLLMs. However, existing research is unsuitable in the
definitions of semantic tokens and acoustic tokens. In addition, the evaluation
of different codecs typically concentrates on specific domains or tasks, such
as reconstruction or Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) task, which prevents
fair and comprehensive comparisons. To address these problems, this paper
provides suitable definitions for semantic and acoustic tokens and introduces a
systematic evaluation framework. This framework allows for a comprehensive
assessment of codecs' capabilities which evaluate across four dimensions: audio
reconstruction metric, codebook index (ID) stability, decoder-only transformer
perplexity, and performance on downstream probe tasks. Our results show the
correctness of the provided suitable definitions and the correlation among
reconstruction metrics, codebook ID stability, downstream probe tasks and
perplexity.

Motivation: 探索预训练语音模型在非语音数据（婴儿哭声）上的适用性，以及这些模型中编码的具体声学特性。

Method: 在8个婴儿哭声数据集（共115小时音频，来自960名婴儿）上评估5个预训练语音模型，分析各模型在所有可用分类任务中的潜在表示。

Result: 预训练语音模型的潜在表示能有效分类人类婴儿哭声，并编码关键的声源不稳定性和婴儿身份信息。

Conclusion: 研究结果为未来针对类似任务（如情绪检测）的模型设计提供了有价值的架构和训练策略见解。

Abstract: Transfer learning using latent representations from pre-trained speech models
achieves outstanding performance in tasks where labeled data is scarce.
However, their applicability to non-speech data and the specific acoustic
properties encoded in these representations remain largely unexplored. In this
study, we investigate both aspects. We evaluate five pre-trained speech models
on eight baby cries datasets, encompassing 115 hours of audio from 960 babies.
For each dataset, we assess the latent representations of each model across all
available classification tasks. Our results demonstrate that the latent
representations of these models can effectively classify human baby cries and
encode key information related to vocal source instability and identity of the
crying baby. In addition, a comparison of the architectures and training
strategies of these models offers valuable insights for the design of future
models tailored to similar tasks, such as emotion detection.

Motivation: 工业设备异常声音检测的核心挑战在于建模声学特征的时频耦合特性，现有方法受限于局部感受野，难以捕捉机器声学特征中的长程时序模式和跨频带动态耦合效应

Method: ESTM框架采用双路径Mamba架构，结合时间-频率解耦建模，使用选择性状态空间模型进行长程序列建模，通过融合增强梅尔频谱图和原始音频特征提取丰富特征表示，并利用TriStat-Gating模块提高对异常模式的敏感性

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在工业设备异常声音检测中表现出有效性，验证了时间-频率解耦建模和选择性状态空间模型在捕捉长程时频耦合特征方面的优势

Abstract: The core challenge in industrial equipment anoma lous sound detection (ASD)
lies in modeling the time-frequency coupling characteristics of acoustic
features. Existing modeling methods are limited by local receptive fields,
making it difficult to capture long-range temporal patterns and cross-band
dynamic coupling effects in machine acoustic features. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework, ESTM, which is based on a dual-path Mamba
architecture with time-frequency decoupled modeling and utilizes Selective
State-Space Models (SSM) for long-range sequence modeling. ESTM extracts rich
feature representations from different time segments and frequency bands by
fusing enhanced Mel spectrograms and raw audio features, while further
improving sensitivity to anomalous patterns through the TriStat-Gating (TSG)
module. Our experiments demonstrate that ESTM improves anomalous detection
performance on the DCASE 2020 Task 2 dataset, further validating the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

Motivation: 传统电网基础设施阻碍可再生能源整合并加剧能源获取不平等，低收入社区经历不成比例的长时间停电，需要解决清洁能源转型中的社会公平问题

Method: 建立马尔可夫决策过程(MDP)框架，包含预算约束、能源需求变化和社会脆弱性指标，比较随机分配、贪婪扩展和专家启发式等基准策略

Result: 公平优化方法实现32.9%可再生能源渗透率，服务不足低收入人群减少55%；专家策略获得最高奖励，蒙特卡洛树搜索基线以显著更低预算提供竞争性表现

Conclusion: 公平分配清洁能源资源可在不牺牲整体系统性能的情况下实现，为社会公平考虑与气候目标及包容性清洁电力基础设施接入的整合提供了途径

Abstract: Traditional power grid infrastructure presents significant barriers to
renewable energy integration and perpetuates energy access inequities, with
low-income communities experiencing disproportionately longer power outages.
This study develops a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to optimize
renewable energy allocation while explicitly addressing social equity concerns
in electricity distribution. The model incorporates budget constraints, energy
demand variability, and social vulnerability indicators across eight major U.S.
cities to evaluate policy alternatives for equitable clean energy transitions.
Numerical experiments compare the MDP-based approach against baseline policies
including random allocation, greedy renewable expansion, and expert heuristics.
Results demonstrate that equity-focused optimization can achieve 32.9%
renewable energy penetration while reducing underserved low-income populations
by 55% compared to conventional approaches. The expert policy achieved the
highest reward, while the Monte Carlo Tree Search baseline provided competitive
performance with significantly lower budget utilization, demonstrating that
fair distribution of clean energy resources is achievable without sacrificing
overall system performance and providing ways for integrating social equity
considerations with climate goals and inclusive access to clean power
infrastructure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代电网的最优潮流问题规模庞大且非凸，传统方法面临可扩展性和最优性挑战，需要利用量子计算的优势来解决这一复杂优化问题。

Method: 使用两个参数化量子电路：一个编码原始变量状态，另一个编码对偶变量的概率分布。通过测量量子可观测量得到拉格朗日函数，采用混合量子-经典方法更新参数，并利用带状结构提高测量效率。

Result: 在IEEE 57节点电力系统上的数值测试表明，该双变分量子框架能够找到高质量的最优潮流解，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于最优潮流问题，还具有更广泛的适用性，包括锥规划、稀疏图问题以及带约束的量子机器学习模型训练。

Abstract: The optimal power flow (OPF) is a large-scale optimization problem that is
central in the operation of electric power systems. Although it can be posed as
a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program, the complexity of
modern-day power grids raises scalability and optimality challenges. In this
context, this work proposes a variational quantum paradigm for solving the OPF.
We encode primal variables through the state of a parameterized quantum circuit
(PQC), and dual variables through the probability mass function associated with
a second PQC. The Lagrangian function can thus be expressed as scaled
expectations of quantum observables. An OPF solution can be found by
minimizing/maximizing the Lagrangian over the parameters of the first/second
PQC. We pursue saddle points of the Lagrangian in a hybrid fashion. Gradients
of the Lagrangian are estimated using the two PQCs, while PQC parameters are
updated classically using a primal-dual method. We propose permuting primal
variables so that OPF observables are expressed in a banded form, allowing them
to be measured efficiently. Numerical tests on the IEEE 57-node power system
using Pennylane's simulator corroborate that the proposed doubly variational
quantum framework can find high-quality OPF solutions. Although showcased for
the OPF, this framework features a broader scope, including conic programs with
numerous variables and constraints, problems defined over sparse graphs, and
training quantum machine learning models to satisfy constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对协调网络攻击对径向微电网的威胁，需要开发能够快速适应防御策略并预测高影响事故的弹性框架，同时确保满足网络物理约束。

Method: 使用超图神经网络(HGNN)增强模型无关元学习(MAML)建模攻击者；通过双层Stackelberg博弈建模防御者，上层使用ADMM协调器嵌入NSGA-II算法优化联络线切换和分布式能源调度。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效提升微电网对协调网络攻击的弹性，提供可操作的操作规则（如预武装特定联络线），并具有良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: This paper presents a physics-aware cyberphysical resilience framework for
radial microgrids under coordinated cyberattacks. The proposed approach models
the attacker through a hypergraph neural network (HGNN) enhanced with model
agnostic metalearning (MAML) to rapidly adapt to evolving defense strategies
and predict high-impact contingencies. The defender is modeled via a bi-level
Stackelberg game, where the upper level selects optimal tie-line switching and
distributed energy resource (DER) dispatch using an Alternating Direction
Method of Multipliers (ADMM) coordinator embedded within the Non-dominated
Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). The framework simultaneously optimizes
load served, operational cost, and voltage stability, ensuring all post-defense
states satisfy network physics constraints. The methodology is first validated
on the IEEE 69-bus distribution test system with 12 DERs, 8 critical loads, and
5 tie-lines, and then extended to higher bus systems including the IEEE 123-bus
feeder and a synthetic 300-bus distribution system. Results show that the
proposed defense strategy restores nearly full service for 90% of top-ranked
attacks, mitigates voltage violations, and identifies Feeder 2 as the principal
vulnerability corridor. Actionable operating rules are derived, recommending
pre-arming of specific tie-lines to enhance resilience, while higher bus system
studies confirm scalability of the framework on the IEEE 123-bus and 300-bus
systems.

Abstract: Recent work has proposed machine learning (ML) approaches as fast surrogates
for solving AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF), with claims of significant
speed-ups and high accuracy. In this paper, we revisit these claims through a
systematic evaluation of ML models against a set of simple yet carefully
designed linear baselines. We introduce OPFormer-V, a transformer-based model
for predicting bus voltages, and compare it to both the state-of-the-art
DeepOPF-V model and simple linear methods. Our findings reveal that, while
OPFormer-V improves over DeepOPF-V, the relative gains of the ML approaches
considered are less pronounced than expected. Simple linear baselines can
achieve comparable performance. These results highlight the importance of
including strong linear baselines in future evaluations.

Abstract: Magnetic levitation is poised to revolutionize industrial automation by
integrating flexible in-machine product transport and seamless manipulation. It
is expected to become the standard drive for automated manufacturing. However,
controlling such systems is inherently challenging due to their complex,
unstable dynamics. Traditional control approaches, which rely on hand-crafted
control engineering, typically yield robust but conservative solutions, with
their performance closely tied to the expertise of the engineering team. In
contrast, neural control learning presents a promising alternative. This paper
presents the first neural controller for 6D magnetic levitation. Trained
end-to-end on interaction data from a proprietary controller, it directly maps
raw sensor data and 6D reference poses to coil current commands. The neural
controller can effectively generalize to previously unseen situations while
maintaining accurate and robust control. These results underscore the practical
feasibility of learning-based neural control in complex physical systems and
suggest a future where such a paradigm could enhance or even substitute
traditional engineering approaches in demanding real-world applications. The
trained neural controller, source code, and demonstration videos are publicly

Conclusion: 该框架为无合作NLoS发射器定位提供了可扩展且物理基础扎实的解决方案，兼容现有RSS定位算法，实现了物理知识与数据驱动推理的双重驱动

Abstract: Accurate localization of non-cooperative signal sources in non-line-of-sight
(NLoS) environments remains a critical challenge with a wide range of
applications, including autonomous navigation, industrial automation, and
emergency response. In such settings, traditional positioning techniques
relying on line-of-sight (LoS) or cooperative signaling fail due to severe
multipath propagation and unknown transmit power. This paper proposes a novel
generative inference framework for NLoS localization based on conditional
diffusion models. By leveraging the physical insight that diffracted
electromagnetic energy concentrates near building edges, we develop a sampling
strategy that collects sparse received signal strength (RSS) measurements at
the geometric vertices of obstacles--locations that maximize Fisher information
and mutual information with respect to the unknown source. To overcome the lack
of known transmission power, we normalize all sampled RSS values relative to
the maximum observed intensity, enabling the construction of a power-invariant
radio map (RM). A conditional diffusion model is trained to reconstruct the
full RM based on environmental layout and sparse RSS observations. Localization
is then achieved by identifying the brightest point on the generated RM.
Moreover, the proposed framework is compatible with existing RSS-based
localization algorithms, enabling a dual-driven paradigm that fuses physical
knowledge and data-driven inference for improved accuracy. Extensive
theoretical analysis and empirical validation demonstrate that our approach
achieves high localization accuracy with significantly reduced sampling cost,
offering a scalable and physically grounded solution for non-cooperative NLoS
emitter localization.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a data-driven Forward Selection with Neighborhood
Refinement (FSNR) algorithm to determine the number and placement of Phasor
Measurement Units (PMUs) for maximizing deep-learning-based fault diagnosis
performance. Candidate PMU locations are ranked via a cross-validated Support

neighborhood exploration to produce a near-optimal sensor set. The resulting
PMU subset is then supplied to a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for
faulted-line localization and fault-type classification from time-series
measurements. Evaluation on modified IEEE 34- and IEEE 123-bus systems
demonstrates that the proposed FSNR-SVM method identifies a minimal PMU
configuration that achieves the best overall CNN performance, attaining over 96
percent accuracy in fault location and over 99 percent accuracy in fault-type
classification on the IEEE 34 system, and approximately 94 percent accuracy in

Method: 形式化了三种不同的对称性概念，证明在这些条件下学习问题可转化为在线学习实例，设计了适用于矩阵和马尔可夫博弈的多项式时间算法。

Conclusion: 该工作拓宽了在严重信息劣势下可能实现鲁棒学习的游戏类别，深化了在线学习与对抗性博弈论之间的联系。

Abstract: Optimization under uncertainty is a fundamental problem in learning and
decision-making, particularly in multi-agent systems. Previously, Feldman,
Kalai, and Tennenholtz [2010] demonstrated the ability to efficiently compete
in repeated symmetric two-player matrix games without observing payoffs, as
long as the opponents actions are observed. In this paper, we introduce and
formalize a new class of zero-sum symmetric Markov games, which extends the
notion of symmetry from matrix games to the Markovian setting. We show that
even without observing payoffs, a player who knows the transition dynamics and
observes only the opponents sequence of actions can still compete against an
adversary who may have complete knowledge of the game. We formalize three
distinct notions of symmetry in this setting and show that, under these
conditions, the learning problem can be reduced to an instance of online
learning, enabling the player to asymptotically match the return of the
opponent despite lacking payoff observations. Our algorithms apply to both
matrix and Markov games, and run in polynomial time with respect to the size of
the game and the number of episodes. Our work broadens the class of games in
which robust learning is possible under severe informational disadvantage and
deepens the connection between online learning and adversarial game theory.

Motivation: 在线平台低质量内容泛滥往往源于缺乏有效的准入门槛，研究旨在探索隐性和显性进入壁垒配合适当奖励机制是否能提升内容质量。

Method: 采用博弈论分析方法，研究两种进入壁垒：结构性壁垒（由现有内容提供者集体行为形成）和战略性壁垒（平台主动设置进入费用），并分析不同奖励分配机制的效果。

Result: 研究发现两种奖励机制（排名制和按比例分配）都会在纳什均衡中产生结构性壁垒；平台设置进入费用并将费用重新投入奖励池的战略性壁垒能够有效提升整体内容质量。

Conclusion: 研究为设计结合进入费用的奖励机制提供了理论基础，这种机制能够促进更高质量内容的产生，支持更健康的在线生态系统建设。

Abstract: The prevalence of low-quality content on online platforms is often attributed
to the absence of meaningful entry requirements. This motivates us to
investigate whether implicit or explicit entry barriers, alongside appropriate
reward mechanisms, can enhance content quality. We present the first
game-theoretic analysis of two distinct types of entry barriers in online
content platforms. The first, a structural barrier, emerges from the collective
behaviour of incumbent content providers which disadvantages new entrants. We
show that both rank-order and proportional-share reward mechanisms induce such
a structural barrier at Nash equilibrium. The second, a strategic barrier,
involves the platform proactively imposing entry fees to discourage
participation from low-quality contributors. We consider a scheme in which the
platform redirects some or all of the entry fees into the reward pool. We
formally demonstrate that this approach can improve overall content quality.
Our findings establish a theoretical foundation for designing reward mechanisms
coupled with entry fees to promote higher-quality content and support healthier
online ecosystems.

Abstract: Urban noise pollution poses a significant threat to public health, yet
existing monitoring infrastructures offer limited spatial coverage and
adaptability. This paper presents a scalable, low-cost, IoT-based, real-time
environmental noise monitoring solution using mobile nodes (sensor nodes on a
moving vehicle). The system utilizes a low-cost sound sensor integrated with
GPS-enabled modules to collect geotagged noise data at one-second intervals.
The sound nodes are calibrated against a reference sound level meter in a
laboratory setting to ensure accuracy using various machine learning (ML)
algorithms, such as Simple Linear Regression (SLR), Multiple Linear Regression
(MLR), Polynomial Regression (PR), Segmented Regression (SR), Support Vector
Regression (SVR), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest Regression (RFR). While
laboratory calibration demonstrates high accuracy, it is shown that the
performance of the nodes degrades during data collection in a moving vehicle.
To address this, it is demonstrated that the calibration must be performed on
the IoT-based node based on the data collected in a moving environment along
with the reference device. Among the employed ML models, RFR achieved the best
performance with an R2 of 0.937 and RMSE of 1.09 for mobile calibration. The
system was deployed in Hyderabad, India, through three measurement campaigns
across 27 days, capturing 436,420 data points. Results highlight temporal and
spatial noise variations across weekdays, weekends, and during Diwali.
Incorporating vehicular velocity into the calibration significantly improves
accuracy. The proposed system demonstrates the potential for widespread
deployment of IoT-based noise sensing networks in smart cities, enabling
effective noise pollution management and urban planning.

Abstract: Satellite Communication (SatCom) networks represent a fundamental pillar in
modern global connectivity, facilitating reliable service and extensive

Method: 开发了一个无监督框架，能够自动识别和移除对训练无用的流量（如无关协议、后台活动、控制平面消息和长会话），无需人工干预。

Result: 在真实数据集上的评估显示，该框架相比人工清理仅导致分类准确率下降2%~2.5%，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该无监督框架为基于机器学习的加密流量分类提供了一个高效且有效的预处理步骤，显著降低了数据清理的成本和时间消耗。

Abstract: Traffic classification, a technique for assigning network flows to predefined
categories, has been widely deployed in enterprise and carrier networks. With
the massive adoption of mobile devices, encryption is increasingly used in
mobile applications to address privacy concerns. Consequently, traditional
methods such as Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) fail to distinguish encrypted
traffic. To tackle this challenge, Artificial Intelligence (AI), in particular
Machine Learning (ML), has emerged as a promising solution for encrypted
traffic classification. A crucial prerequisite for any ML-based approach is
traffic data cleaning, which removes flows that are not useful for training
(e.g., irrelevant protocols, background activity, control-plane messages, and
long-lived sessions). Existing cleaning solutions depend on manual inspection
of every captured packet, making the process both costly and time-consuming. In
this poster, we present an unsupervised framework that automatically cleans
encrypted mobile traffic. Evaluation on real-world datasets shows that our
framework incurs only a 2%~2.5% reduction in classification accuracy compared
with manual cleaning. These results demonstrate that our method offers an
efficient and effective preprocessing step for ML-based encrypted traffic
classification.

TL;DR: 该研究探索了量子机器学习和量子启发技术用于优化5G网络端到端服务，通过混合量子经典计算框架提升用户体验质量，结果显示QML在准确性和推理时间方面优于传统ML方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索量子机器学习和量子启发技术在电信系统网络服务优化中的应用，特别是在5G及后续网络中，旨在利用量子计算优势解决传统机器学习方法的局限性。

Method: 采用混合量子经典计算框架，包含基于用户指标、服务设置和小区配置的QoE估计器，以及使用估计结果选择最佳配置的优化器，特别针对云游戏服务进行网络配置优化。

Result: QML模型在估计准确性方面达到或超过传统ML模型，同时减少了推理和加载时间，在高维数据场景下表现出更好的性能潜力。

Conclusion: 研究证明了QML在网络优化中的巨大潜力，但数据可用性以及量子与经典ML集成复杂性仍是未来需要解决的研究挑战。

Abstract: This work explores the integration of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and
Quantum-Inspired (QI) techniques for optimizing end-to-end (E2E) network
services in telecommunication systems, particularly focusing on 5G networks and
beyond. The application of QML and QI algorithms is investigated, comparing
their performance with classical Machine Learning (ML) approaches. The present
study employs a hybrid framework combining quantum and classical computing
leveraging the strengths of QML and QI, without the penalty of quantum hardware
availability. This is particularized for the optimization of the Quality of
Experience (QoE) over cellular networks. The framework comprises an estimator
for obtaining the expected QoE based on user metrics, service settings, and
cell configuration, and an optimizer that uses the estimation to choose the
best cell and service configuration. Although the approach is applicable to any
QoE-based network management, its implementation is particularized for the
optimization of network configurations for Cloud Gaming services. Then, it is
evaluated via performance metrics such as accuracy and model loading and
inference times for the estimator, and time to solution and solution score for
the optimizer. The results indicate that QML models achieve similar or superior
accuracy to classical ML models for estimation, while decreasing inference and
loading times. Furthermore, potential for better performance is observed for
higher-dimensional data, highlighting promising results for higher complexity
problems. Thus, the results demonstrate the promising potential of QML in
advancing network optimization, although challenges related to data
availability and integration complexities between quantum and classical ML are
identified as future research lines.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文提出了统一孪生变换（UTT）框架，探索网络数字孪生（NDTs）之间的互操作，实现高效传输、合并和分割以创建任务导向的孪生体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字孪生技术推动下一代网络发展，但构建精确NDTs面临数据整合、属性映射和可扩展性等挑战。现有研究主要关注从零创建NDTs，而本文探索NDTs之间的互操作。

Method: 采用统一孪生变换（UTT）框架，利用联合多模态和分布式映射机制，通过理论分析建立多模态门控聚合过程的收敛边界。

Result: 在轨迹重建、人员定位和传感数据生成等真实孪生辅助应用中验证了NDTs互操作的可行性和有效性，优化了资源利用率并降低了创建成本。

Conclusion: UTT框架为NDTs提供了新的计算范式，通过互操作实现了任务导向的孪生体创建，确保了孪生模型一致性并提升了应用开发效率。

Abstract: The integration of digital twinning technologies is driving next-generation
networks toward new capabilities, allowing operators to thoroughly understand
network conditions, efficiently analyze valuable radio data, and innovate
applications through user-friendly, immersive interfaces. Building on this
foundation, network digital twins (NDTs) accurately depict the operational
processes and attributes of network infrastructures, facilitating predictive
management through real-time analysis and measurement. However, constructing
precise NDTs poses challenges, such as integrating diverse data sources,
mapping necessary attributes from physical networks, and maintaining
scalability for various downstream tasks. Unlike previous works that focused on
the creation and mapping of NDTs from scratch, we explore intra- and
inter-operations among NDTs within a Unified Twin Transformation (UTT)
framework, which uncovers a new computing paradigm for efficient transfer,
merging, and splitting of NDTs to create task-oriented twins. By leveraging
joint multi-modal and distributed mapping mechanisms, UTT optimizes resource
utilization and reduces the cost of creating NDTs, while ensuring twin model
consistency. A theoretical analysis of the distributed mapping problem is
conducted to establish convergence bounds for this multi-modal gated
aggregation process. Evaluations on real-world twin-assisted applications, such
as trajectory reconstruction, human localization, and sensory data generation,
demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of interoperability among NDTs
for corresponding task development.

Method: 结合力导向投影和流式聚类方法，构建嵌入向量的时空映射

Result: 开发了Chronotome交互工具，在文本和图像数据用例中展示了其有效性

Conclusion: 该方法为理解时序数据集的美学和语义提供了新的视角

Abstract: Many real-world datasets -- from an artist's body of work to a person's
social media history -- exhibit meaningful semantic changes over time that are
difficult to capture with existing dimensionality reduction methods. To address
this gap, we introduce a visualization technique that combines force-based
projection and streaming clustering methods to build a spatial-temporal map of
embeddings. Applying this technique, we create Chronotome, a tool for
interactively exploring evolving themes in time-based data -- in real time. We
demonstrate the utility of our approach through use cases on text and image
data, showing how it offers a new lens for understanding the aesthetics and
semantics of temporal datasets.

TL;DR: E-THER是首个基于人本主义疗法的多模态数据集，专注于识别言语-视觉情绪不一致性，用于训练具有真正共情能力的AI系统，而非表面表演性共情。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有共情AI系统无法识别言语表达与真实情感状态的不一致性，因为现有数据集只关注表层情绪识别，缺乏对言语-视觉不一致模式的复杂理解。

Method: 创建基于人本中心疗法的多模态数据集，包含多维标注的言语-视觉不一致性检测，提供行为参与度评分，用于训练和评估AI在共情任务上的表现。

Result: 使用IDEFICS和VideoLLAVA等先进视觉语言模型进行实验，发现经过不一致性训练的模型在维持治疗参与度、减少人工化语言模式、保持理论框架忠实度等关键特质上优于通用模型。

Conclusion: E-THER数据集为训练真正具有共情能力的AI系统提供了重要基础，通过识别言语-视觉情绪不一致性，能够显著提升AI在治疗性对话中的质量和真实性。

Abstract: A prevalent shortfall among current empathic AI systems is their inability to
recognize when verbal expressions may not fully reflect underlying emotional
states. This is because the existing datasets, used for the training of these
systems, focus on surface-level emotion recognition without addressing the
complex verbal-visual incongruence (mismatch) patterns useful for empathic
understanding. In this paper, we present E-THER, the first Person-Centered
Therapy-grounded multimodal dataset with multidimensional annotations for
verbal-visual incongruence detection, enabling training of AI systems that
develop genuine rather than performative empathic capabilities. The annotations
included in the dataset are drawn from humanistic approach, i.e., identifying
verbal-visual emotional misalignment in client-counsellor interactions -
forming a framework for training and evaluating AI on empathy tasks. Additional
engagement scores provide behavioral annotations for research applications.
Notable gains in empathic and therapeutic conversational qualities are observed
in state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), such as IDEFICS and
VideoLLAVA, using evaluation metrics grounded in empathic and therapeutic
principles. Empirical findings indicate that our incongruence-trained models
outperform general-purpose models in critical traits, such as sustaining
therapeutic engagement, minimizing artificial or exaggerated linguistic
patterns, and maintaining fidelity to PCT theoretical framework.

TL;DR: 提出基于图框架的实时情绪调节系统，结合评论队列机制，有效减少在线毒性和愤怒传播


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注事后审核，忽略了在线对话的实时情绪动态和用户情绪对他人影响，需要实时情绪调节机制

Method: 基于图的情绪调节框架促进自我反思，结合评论队列机制延迟发布评论，给用户自我调节时间

Result: Twitter和Reddit数据分析显示：图框架减少12%毒性，评论队列机制减少15%愤怒传播，平均仅4%评论被暂时保留

Conclusion: 实时情绪调节与延迟审核相结合能显著改善在线环境福祉

Abstract: The pervasiveness of online toxicity, including hate speech and trolling,
disrupts digital interactions and online well-being. Previous research has
mainly focused on post-hoc moderation, overlooking the real-time emotional
dynamics of online conversations and the impact of users' emotions on others.
This paper presents a graph-based framework to identify the need for emotion
regulation within online conversations. This framework promotes self-reflection
to manage emotional responses and encourage responsible behaviour in real time.
Additionally, a comment queuing mechanism is proposed to address intentional
trolls who exploit emotions to inflame conversations. This mechanism introduces
a delay in publishing comments, giving users time to self-regulate before
further engaging in the conversation and helping maintain emotional balance.
Analysis of social media data from Twitter and Reddit demonstrates that the
graph-based framework reduced toxicity by 12%, while the comment queuing
mechanism decreased the spread of anger by 15%, with only 4% of comments being
temporarily held on average. These findings indicate that combining real-time
emotion regulation with delayed moderation can significantly improve well-being
in online environments.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了学生过度依赖GenAI完成作业的问题，提出了通过设计需要更多努力的AI工具来平衡学习体验，以促进写作和批判性思维技能的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学生普遍使用ChatGPT等GenAI工具完成作业，虽然省力但可能阻碍写作和批判性思维能力的培养。需要找到方法逆转这种趋势，让学生在享受AI便利的同时也能获得深度学习体验。

Method: 提出设计新型AI工具，要求学生在使用过程中付出更多努力，如结合传统学习方法（记笔记等），并探讨如何设计能增强人类认知的思考工具，促进元认知和反思技能的发展。

Result: 初步构想了需要更多努力使用的AI工具形式，旨在通过增加使用难度来深化学习体验，平衡便利性与教育价值。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计的AI工具，可以在减少努力和增加努力之间找到平衡，既利用AI的效率优势，又确保学生获得必要的学习技能和成就感。

Abstract: Students routinely use ChatGPT and the like now to help them with their
homework, such as writing an essay. It takes less effort to complete and is
easier to do than by hand. It can even produce as good if not better output
than the student's own work. However, there is a growing concern that
over-reliance on using GenAI in this way will stifle the development of
learning writing and critical thinking skills. How might this trend be
reversed? What if students were required to make more effort when using GenAI
to do their homework? It might be more challenging, but the additional effort
involved could result in them learning more and having a greater sense of
achievement. This tension can be viewed as a form of effort paradox; where
effort is both viewed as something to be avoided but at the same time is
valued. Is it possible to let students learn sometimes with less and other
times more effort? Students are already adept at the former but what about the
latter? Could we design new kinds of AI tools that deliberately require more
effort to use to deepen the learning experience? In this paper, I begin to
outline what form these might take, for example, asking students to use a
combination of GenAI tools with traditional learning approaches (e.g.
note-taking while reading). I also discuss how else to design tools to think
with that augments human cognition; where students learn more the skills of
metacognition and reflection.

Motivation: 现有AR/VR设备主要使用空中手势界面，而基于身体的输入在速度、准确性和人体工程学方面具有显著优势，但缺乏实用可靠的方法

Method: 仅使用RGB相机（现代XR头显已集成）实现裸手皮肤输入，无需用户特殊装备，支持多种光照条件、肤色和身体运动

Result: 该方法具有高精度和鲁棒性，能在行走等运动中保持准确输入，并提供丰富的输入元数据（触摸力度、手指识别、攻击角度和旋转）

Conclusion: 这项技术为HCI文献中已有充分理论支持但缺乏实用方法的皮肤界面提供了关键的技术基础，有望完全解锁基于皮肤的交互界面

Abstract: In augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) experiences, a user's arms and hands
can provide a convenient and tactile surface for touch input. Prior work has
shown on-body input to have significant speed, accuracy, and ergonomic benefits
over in-air interfaces, which are common today. In this work, we demonstrate
high accuracy, bare hands (i.e., no special instrumentation of the user) skin
input using just an RGB camera, like those already integrated into all modern
XR headsets. Our results show this approach can be accurate, and robust across
diverse lighting conditions, skin tones, and body motion (e.g., input while
walking). Finally, our pipeline also provides rich input metadata including
touch force, finger identification, angle of attack, and rotation. We believe
these are the requisite technical ingredients to more fully unlock on-skin
interfaces that have been well motivated in the HCI literature but have lacked
robust and practical methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的推出，人工智能代理是否能替代人类治疗师的问题受到广泛关注，但目前对人工智能代理提供心理治疗时的改变过程了解甚少，需要建立理论框架来促进假设发展和科学讨论。

Method: 通过对人类治疗师存在所固有的活性成分进行概念分析，提出了理论框架，重点分析了人类治疗师的本体论地位（作为人类）和社会文化地位（作为社会认可的医疗专业人员）在促进治疗效果中的关键作用。

Result: 提出了"真实性差距"和"可信度差距"的概念，指出在缺乏人类治疗师的本体论和社会文化地位时，这些差距可能出现并削弱心理治疗中的关键改变过程。

Conclusion: 为科学研究和实际应用提供了方向，建议分别利用人工智能代理和人类治疗师的优势，同时强调了人工智能代理复杂的代理性质，这使得建立普遍适用的改变过程命题变得复杂。

Abstract: The question of whether artificial agents (e.g., chatbots and social robots)
can replace human therapists has received notable attention following the
recent launch of large language models. However, little is known about the
processes of change in psychotherapy delivered by artificial agents. To
facilitate hypothesis development and stimulate scientific debate, the present
article offers the first theoretical framework of the processes of change in
psychotherapy delivered by artificial agents. The theoretical framework rests
upon a conceptual analysis of what active ingredients may be inherently linked
to the presence of human therapists. We propose that human therapists'
ontological status as human beings and sociocultural status as socially
sanctioned healthcare professionals play crucial roles in promoting treatment
outcomes. In the absence of the ontological and sociocultural status of human
therapists, we propose what we coin the genuineness gap and credibility gap can
emerge and undermine key processes of change in psychotherapy. Based on these
propositions, we propose avenues for scientific investigations and practical
applications aimed at leveraging the strengths of artificial agents and human
therapists respectively. We also highlight the intricate agentic nature of
artificial agents and discuss how this complicates endeavors to establish
universally applicable propositions regarding the processes of change in these
interventions.

attention to with regards to building AI literacy with different stakeholders
using the system. This includes the importance of high-quality data for
training learning-based systems as well as the integration of human expertise,
especially with knowledge-based systems. In terms of the psychological factors
we derive research questions to investigate in the development of AI supported
work systems and to consider in future work, mainly concerned with topics such
as acceptance, openness, and trust in an AI system.

Abstract: Recently, the benefit of heavily overparameterized models has been observed

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解蛋白质结构动力学对于阐明生物功能至关重要，但分子动力学模拟计算成本高，限制了可扩展性，需要开发更高效的预测方法。

Method: 通过多元高斯透镜将问题建模，预测两个互补尺度的动力学：(1)每个残基的边际各向异性作为3×3协方差矩阵；(2)残基间成对的动态耦合标量协方差。

Result: DynaProt在预测残基级灵活性(RMSF)方面达到高精度，并能合理重建完整协方差矩阵进行快速集合生成，且使用参数比现有方法少几个数量级。

Conclusion: 直接蛋白质动力学预测作为现有方法的可扩展替代方案具有巨大潜力，DynaProt为此提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Many methods have been developed to predict static protein structures,
however understanding the dynamics of protein structure is essential for
elucidating biological function. While molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
remain the in silico gold standard, its high computational cost limits
scalability. We present DynaProt, a lightweight, SE(3)-invariant framework that
predicts rich descriptors of protein dynamics directly from static structures.
By casting the problem through the lens of multivariate Gaussians, DynaProt
estimates dynamics at two complementary scales: (1) per-residue marginal
anisotropy as $3 \times 3$ covariance matrices capturing local flexibility, and
(2) joint scalar covariances encoding pairwise dynamic coupling across
residues. From these dynamics outputs, DynaProt achieves high accuracy in
predicting residue-level flexibility (RMSF) and, remarkably, enables reasonable
reconstruction of the full covariance matrix for fast ensemble generation.
Notably, it does so using orders of magnitude fewer parameters than prior
methods. Our results highlight the potential of direct protein dynamics
prediction as a scalable alternative to existing methods.

Motivation: 虽然LD-FPG能够生成生物分子的静态平衡系综，但它无法模拟构象之间的时间演化过程，这限制了其在动力学研究中的应用。

Method: 在统一的编码器-传播器-解码器框架中，比较了三种潜在空间传播方法：(i)分数引导的朗之万动力学，(ii)基于Koopman的线性算子，(iii)自回归神经网络。

Result: 自回归神经网络在长时程稳定性方面表现最佳；分数引导朗之万动力学在分数学习良好时能最好地恢复侧链热力学；Koopman方法提供了可解释的轻量级基线但倾向于抑制波动。

Conclusion: 研究阐明了不同传播器之间的权衡取舍，为全原子蛋白质动力学的潜在空间模拟器提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Simulating the long-timescale dynamics of biomolecules is a central challenge
in computational science. While enhanced sampling methods can accelerate these
simulations, they rely on pre-defined collective variables that are often
difficult to identify. A recent generative model, LD-FPG, demonstrated that
this problem could be bypassed by learning to sample the static equilibrium
ensemble as all-atom deformations from a reference structure, establishing a
powerful method for all-atom ensemble generation. However, while this approach
successfully captures a system's probable conformations, it does not model the
temporal evolution between them. Here we extend LD-FPG with a temporal
propagator that operates within the learned latent space and compare three
classes: (i) score-guided Langevin dynamics, (ii) Koopman-based linear
operators, and (iii) autoregressive neural networks. Within a unified
encoder-propagator-decoder framework, we evaluate long-horizon stability,
backbone and side-chain ensemble fidelity, and functional free-energy
landscapes. Autoregressive neural networks deliver the most robust long
rollouts; score-guided Langevin best recovers side-chain thermodynamics when
the score is well learned; and Koopman provides an interpretable, lightweight
baseline that tends to damp fluctuations. These results clarify the trade-offs
among propagators and offer practical guidance for latent-space simulators of
all-atom protein dynamics.

Abstract: Peptide self-assembly prediction offers a powerful bottom-up strategy for
designing biocompatible, low-toxicity materials for large-scale synthesis in a
broad range of biomedical and energy applications. However, screening the vast
sequence space for categorization of aggregate morphology remains intractable.
We introduce PepMorph, an end-to-end peptide discovery pipeline that generates
novel sequences that are not only prone to aggregate but self-assemble into a
specified fibrillar or spherical morphology. We compiled a new dataset by
leveraging existing aggregation propensity datasets and extracting geometric
and physicochemical isolated peptide descriptors that act as proxies for
aggregate morphology. This dataset is then used to train a Transformer-based
Conditional Variational Autoencoder with a masking mechanism, which generates
novel peptides under arbitrary conditioning. After filtering to ensure design
specifications and validation of generated sequences through coarse-grained
molecular dynamics simulations, PepMorph yielded 83% accuracy in intended
morphology generation, showcasing its promise as a framework for
application-driven peptide discovery.

### [735] [ERank: Fusing Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning for Effective and Efficient Text Reranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00520)
*Yuzheng Cai,Yanzhao Zhang,Dingkun Long,Mingxin Li,Pengjun Xie,Weiguo Zheng*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: ERank是一个基于推理大语言模型的高效点式重排序器，通过两阶段训练（SFT+RL）解决了现有重排序方法在评分区分度和效率之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的重排序器面临根本性权衡：监督微调的点式方法缺乏评分区分度，而复杂的列表式方法效率低下，不适用于低延迟应用。

Method: 提出两阶段训练流程：1）SFT阶段训练模型生成细粒度整数分数；2）RL阶段使用新颖的列表式奖励进一步优化，将全局排序意识注入高效的点式架构。

Result: 在BRIGHT、FollowIR、TREC DL和BEIR基准测试中表现优异，ERank-4B在BRIGHT基准上达到nDCG@10为38.7，32B变体达到最先进的40.2。

Conclusion: ERank成功解决了重排序中的效率-效果权衡问题，为推理密集型重排序任务提供了既高效又有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text reranking models are a crucial component in modern systems like
Retrieval-Augmented Generation, tasked with selecting the most relevant
documents prior to generation. However, current Large Language Models (LLMs)
powered rerankers often face a fundamental trade-off. On one hand, Supervised
Fine-Tuning based pointwise methods that frame relevance as a binary
classification task lack the necessary scoring discrimination, particularly for
those built on reasoning LLMs. On the other hand, approaches designed for
complex reasoning often employ powerful yet inefficient listwise formulations,
rendering them impractical for low latency applications. To resolve this
dilemma, we introduce ERank, a highly effective and efficient pointwise
reranker built from a reasoning LLM that excels across diverse relevance
scenarios. We propose a novel two-stage training pipeline that begins with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). In this stage, we move beyond binary labels and
train the model generatively to output fine grained integer scores, which
significantly enhances relevance discrimination. The model is then further
refined using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a novel, listwise derived
reward. This technique instills global ranking awareness into the efficient
pointwise architecture. We evaluate the ERank reranker on the BRIGHT, FollowIR,
TREC DL, and BEIR benchmarks, demonstrating superior effectiveness and
robustness compared to existing approaches. On the reasoning-intensive BRIGHT
benchmark, our ERank-4B achieves an nDCG@10 of 38.7, while a larger 32B variant
reaches a state of the art nDCG@10 of 40.2.

### [736] [Beyond Negative Transfer: Disentangled Preference-Guided Diffusion for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00389)
*Xiaoxin Ye,Chengkai Huang,Hongtao Huang,Lina Yao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DPG-Diff是一个新颖的扩散模型，通过解耦域不变和域特定偏好来提升跨域序列推荐性能，有效缓解负迁移和噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨域序列推荐中，简单的序列信号聚合会导致域特定偏好冲突和负迁移问题，同时噪声行为（如误点击）在域异质性下被放大，需要有效解耦三种交织信号。

Method: 提出DPG-Diff扩散模型，将用户偏好分解为域不变和域特定组件，通过解耦引导机制共同指导反向扩散过程，实现鲁棒的跨域知识迁移和噪声过滤。

Result: 在真实数据集上的大量实验表明，DPG-Diff在多个指标上 consistently 优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: DPG-Diff是首个针对跨域序列推荐的扩散模型方法，通过偏好解耦机制有效解决了负迁移和噪声问题，显著提升了推荐质量。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) leverages user behaviors across
domains to enhance recommendation quality. However, naive aggregation of
sequential signals can introduce conflicting domain-specific preferences,
leading to negative transfer. While Sequential Recommendation (SR) already
suffers from noisy behaviors such as misclicks and impulsive actions, CDSR
further amplifies this issue due to domain heterogeneity arising from diverse
item types and user intents. The core challenge is disentangling three
intertwined signals: domain-invariant preferences, domain-specific preferences,
and noise. Diffusion Models (DMs) offer a generative denoising framework
well-suited for disentangling complex user preferences and enhancing robustness
to noise. Their iterative refinement process enables gradual denoising, making
them effective at capturing subtle preference signals. However, existing
applications in recommendation face notable limitations: sequential DMs often
conflate shared and domain-specific preferences, while cross-domain
collaborative filtering DMs neglect temporal dynamics, limiting their ability
to model evolving user preferences. To bridge these gaps, we propose
\textbf{DPG-Diff}, a novel Disentangled Preference-Guided Diffusion Model, the
first diffusion-based approach tailored for CDSR, to or best knowledge.
DPG-Diff decomposes user preferences into domain-invariant and domain-specific
components, which jointly guide the reverse diffusion process. This
disentangled guidance enables robust cross-domain knowledge transfer, mitigates
negative transfer, and filters sequential noise. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that DPG-Diff consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics.

Abstract: As global e-commerce platforms continue to expand, companies are entering new
markets where they encounter cold-start challenges due to limited human labels
and user behaviors. In this paper, we share our experiences in Coupang to
provide a competitive cold-start performance of relevance matching for emerging
e-commerce markets. Specifically, we present a Cold-Start Relevance Matching
(CSRM) framework, utilizing a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) to
address three challenges: (1) activating cross-lingual transfer learning
abilities of LLMs through machine translation tasks; (2) enhancing query
understanding and incorporating e-commerce knowledge by retrieval-based query
augmentation; (3) mitigating the impact of training label errors through a
multi-round self-distillation training strategy. Our experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of CSRM-LLM and the proposed techniques, resulting in
successful real-world deployment and significant online gains, with a 45.8%
reduction in defect ratio and a 0.866% uplift in session purchase rate.

### [738] [Bias Mitigation for AI-Feedback Loops in Recommender Systems: A Systematic Literature Review and Taxonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00109)
*Theodor Stoecker,Samed Bayer,Ingo Weber*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文对推荐系统中的AI反馈循环偏见缓解方法进行了系统性文献综述，筛选出24篇相关研究并构建了可重用的分类法，为从业者提供方法选择指南并为研究者指明研究空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统通过不断重新训练用户对其预测的反应，形成AI反馈循环，这会放大偏见并随时间降低公平性。大多数偏见缓解技术仅在静态数据分割上测试，其长期公平性效果不明确。

Method: 对347篇论文进行系统性文献筛选，最终纳入24篇主要研究（2019-2025年）。每篇研究从六个维度进行编码：缓解技术、处理偏见类型、动态测试设置、评估重点、应用领域和机器学习任务。

Result: 构建了一个可重用的分类法，发现该领域存在共享模拟器短缺、评估指标不统一等问题。大多数研究只报告公平性或性能，仅有6篇同时关注两者。

Conclusion: 该分类法为行业从业者提供了选择稳健方法的快速检查表，并为研究者指明了该领域最紧迫的研究空白，包括需要更多共享模拟器和统一评估标准。

Abstract: Recommender systems continually retrain on user reactions to their own
predictions, creating AI feedback loops that amplify biases and diminish
fairness over time. Despite this well-known risk, most bias mitigation
techniques are tested only on static splits, so their long-term fairness across
multiple retraining rounds remains unclear. We therefore present a systematic
literature review of bias mitigation methods that explicitly consider AI
feedback loops and are validated in multi-round simulations or live A/B tests.
Screening 347 papers yields 24 primary studies published between 2019-2025.
Each study is coded on six dimensions: mitigation technique, biases addressed,
dynamic testing set-up, evaluation focus, application domain, and ML task,
organising them into a reusable taxonomy. The taxonomy offers industry
practitioners a quick checklist for selecting robust methods and gives
researchers a clear roadmap to the field's most urgent gaps. Examples include
the shortage of shared simulators, varying evaluation metrics, and the fact
that most studies report either fairness or performance; only six use both.

### [739] [Algorithm Adaptation Bias in Recommendation System Online Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00199)
*Chen Zheng,Zhenyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文探讨了推荐系统A/B测试中的算法适应偏差问题，这种偏差源于生产模型、用户数据和训练管道之间的飞轮效应，导致小流量测试组性能被低估，从而影响正确的产品决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线实验(A/B测试)被认为是评估推荐系统变体的黄金标准，但算法适应偏差会扭曲实验结果并误导决策。这种偏差源于生产模型、用户数据和训练管道之间的动态交互，导致在受限实验环境中测量的效果与真实部署影响存在显著差异。

Method: 论文详细分析了算法适应偏差的机制，通过真实世界实验提供实证证据，并讨论了跨实验设计、测量和调整的解决方案，以实现更稳健的在线评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，算法适应偏差往往偏向拥有大流量的生产变体，同时低估小流量测试变体的性能，这导致错失真正优胜方案的上线机会或低估其影响。

Conclusion: 论文旨在提高对算法适应偏差的认识，将其置于推荐系统评估偏差的更广泛背景下，并推动讨论涵盖实验设计、测量和调整的解决方案，以实现更准确的在线评估。

Abstract: Online experiments (A/B tests) are widely regarded as the gold standard for
evaluating recommender system variants and guiding launch decisions. However, a
variety of biases can distort the results of the experiment and mislead
decision-making. An underexplored but critical bias is algorithm adaptation
effect. This bias arises from the flywheel dynamics among production models,
user data, and training pipelines: new models are evaluated on user data whose
distributions are shaped by the incumbent system or tested only in a small
treatment group. As a result, the measured effect of a new product change in
modeling and user experience in this constrained experimental setting can
diverge substantially from its true impact in full deployment. In practice, the
experiment results often favor the production variant with large traffic while
underestimating the performance of the test variant with small traffic, which
leads to missing opportunities to launch a true winning arm or underestimating
the impact. This paper aims to raise awareness of algorithm adaptation bias,
situate it within the broader landscape of RecSys evaluation biases, and
motivate discussion of solutions that span experiment design, measurement, and
adjustment. We detail the mechanisms of this bias, present empirical evidence
from real-world experiments, and discuss potential methods for a more robust
online evaluation.

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一个可泛化的解决方案和原则性的评估套件，推动了时序感知检索系统的发展

Abstract: Temporal Information Retrieval (TIR) is a critical yet unresolved task for
modern search systems, retrieving documents that not only satisfy a query's
information need but also adhere to its temporal constraints. This task is
shaped by two challenges: Relevance, ensuring alignment with the query's
explicit temporal requirements, and Recency, selecting the freshest document
among multiple versions. Existing methods often address the two challenges in
isolation, relying on brittle heuristics that fail in scenarios where temporal
requirements and staleness resistance are intertwined. To address this gap, we
introduce Re2Bench, a benchmark specifically designed to disentangle and
evaluate Relevance, Recency, and their hybrid combination. Building on this
foundation, we propose Re3, a unified and lightweight framework that
dynamically balances semantic and temporal information through a query-aware
gating mechanism. On Re2Bench, Re3 achieves state-of-the-art results, leading
in R@1 across all three subsets. Ablation studies with backbone sensitivity
tests confirm robustness, showing strong generalization across diverse encoders
and real-world settings. This work provides both a generalizable solution and a
principled evaluation suite, advancing the development of temporally aware
retrieval systems. Re3 and Re2Bench are available online:

Conclusion: MME-SID框架通过创新的多模态嵌入和量化嵌入方法，成功解决了LLM-based序列推荐中的关键挑战，显著提升了推荐性能

Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to capture users' dynamic interests and
sequential patterns based on their historical interactions. Recently, the
powerful capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have driven their
adoption in SR. However, we identify two critical challenges in existing
LLM-based SR methods: 1) embedding collapse when incorporating pre-trained
collaborative embeddings and 2) catastrophic forgetting of quantized embeddings
when utilizing semantic IDs. These issues dampen the model scalability and lead
to suboptimal recommendation performance. Therefore, based on LLMs like
Llama3-8B-instruct, we introduce a novel SR framework named MME-SID, which
integrates multimodal embeddings and quantized embeddings to mitigate embedding
collapse. Additionally, we propose a Multimodal Residual Quantized Variational
Autoencoder (MM-RQ-VAE) with maximum mean discrepancy as the reconstruction
loss and contrastive learning for alignment, which effectively preserve
intra-modal distance information and capture inter-modal correlations,
respectively. To further alleviate catastrophic forgetting, we initialize the
model with the trained multimodal code embeddings. Finally, we fine-tune the
LLM efficiently using LoRA in a multimodal frequency-aware fusion manner.
Extensive experiments on three public datasets validate the superior
performance of MME-SID thanks to its capability to mitigate embedding collapse
and catastrophic forgetting. The implementation code and datasets are publicly
available for reproduction:

Abstract: The large set of technical documentation of legacy accelerator systems,
coupled with the retirement of experienced personnel, underscores the urgent
need for efficient methods to preserve and transfer specialized knowledge. This
paper explores the application of large language models (LLMs), to automate and
enhance the extraction of information from particle accelerator technical
documents. By exploiting LLMs, we aim to address the challenges of knowledge
retention, enabling the retrieval of domain expertise embedded in legacy
documentation. We present initial results of adapting LLMs to this specialized
domain. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in extracting,
summarizing, and organizing knowledge, significantly reducing the risk of
losing valuable insights as personnel retire. Furthermore, we discuss the
limitations of current LLMs, such as interpretability and handling of rare
domain-specific terms, and propose strategies for improvement. This work
highlights the potential of LLMs to play a pivotal role in preserving
institutional knowledge and ensuring continuity in highly specialized fields.

Abstract: Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) algorithms are popular Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) methods to sample a target probability distribution, which arises in
many applications in machine learning. Inspired by regime-switching stochastic
differential equations in the probability literature, we propose and study
regime-switching Langevin dynamics (RS-LD) and regime-switching kinetic
Langevin dynamics (RS-KLD). Based on their discretizations, we introduce
regime-switching Langevin Monte Carlo (RS-LMC) and regime-switching kinetic
Langevin Monte Carlo (RS-KLMC) algorithms, which can also be viewed as LMC and
KLMC algorithms with random stepsizes. We also propose
frictional-regime-switching kinetic Langevin dynamics (FRS-KLD) and its
associated algorithm frictional-regime-switching kinetic Langevin Monte Carlo
(FRS-KLMC), which can also be viewed as the KLMC algorithm with random
frictional coefficients. We provide their 2-Wasserstein non-asymptotic
convergence guarantees to the target distribution, and analyze the iteration
complexities. Numerical experiments using both synthetic and real data are
provided to illustrate the efficiency of our proposed algorithms.

Abstract: Quantum optical neurons (QONs) are emerging as promising computational units
that leverage photonic interference to perform neural operations in an
energy-efficient and physically grounded manner. Building on recent theoretical
proposals, we introduce a family of QON architectures based on Hong-Ou-Mandel
(HOM) and Mach-Zehnder (MZ) interferometers, incorporating different photon
modulation strategies -- phase, amplitude, and intensity. These physical setups
yield distinct pre-activation functions, which we implement as fully
differentiable modules in software. We evaluate these QONs both in isolation
and as building blocks of multilayer networks, training them on binary and
multiclass image classification tasks using the MNIST and FashionMNIST
datasets. Our experiments show that two configurations -- HOM-based amplitude
modulation and MZ-based phase-shifted modulation -- achieve performance
comparable to that of classical neurons in several settings, and in some cases
exhibit faster or more stable convergence. In contrast, intensity-based
encodings display greater sensitivity to distributional shifts and training
instabilities. These results highlight the potential of QONs as efficient and
scalable components for future quantum-inspired neural architectures and hybrid
photonic-electronic systems.

Result: 研究构建了三个粒度级别的标准测试集，评估显示该方法与OpenIE三元组提取方法相比具有相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: 这种LLM辅助的方法为软件工程标准文档的自动本体生成提供了有效的解决方案，在关系三元组提取方面表现突出。

Abstract: Ontologies have supported knowledge representation and whitebox reasoning for
decades; thus, the automated ontology generation (AOG) plays a crucial role in
scaling their use. Software engineering standards (SES) consist of long,
unstructured text (with high noise) and paragraphs with domain-specific terms.
In this setting, relation triple extraction (RTE), together with term
extraction, constitutes the first stage toward AOG. This work proposes an
open-source large language model (LLM)-assisted approach to RTE for SES.
Instead of solely relying on prompt-engineering-based methods, this study
promotes the use of LLMs as an aid in constructing ontologies and explores an
effective AOG workflow that includes document segmentation, candidate term
mining, LLM-based relation inference, term normalization, and cross-section
alignment. Golden-standard benchmarks at three granularities are constructed
and used to evaluate the ontology generated from the study. The results show
that it is comparable and potentially superior to the OpenIE method of triple
extraction.

TL;DR: ReCode是一个细粒度检索增强的上下文学习框架，通过算法感知检索和模块化双编码器架构，实现高效准确的代码修复，显著降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码修复方法存在高训练成本或昂贵推理的问题，传统检索策略无法捕捉代码结构细节，导致检索质量不佳。

Method: 提出算法感知检索策略缩小搜索空间，采用模块化双编码器架构分别处理代码和文本输入，实现细粒度语义匹配。

Result: 在RACodeBench和竞争性编程数据集上，ReCode实现了更高的修复准确率和显著降低的推理成本。

Conclusion: ReCode框架为现实世界代码修复场景提供了实用价值，展示了检索增强生成在代码相关任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in code-related tasks, such as code generation and automated
program repair. Despite their promising performance, most existing approaches
for code repair suffer from high training costs or computationally expensive
inference. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), with its efficient in-context
learning paradigm, offers a more scalable alternative. However, conventional
retrieval strategies, which are often based on holistic code-text embeddings,
fail to capture the structural intricacies of code, resulting in suboptimal
retrieval quality. To address the above limitations, we propose ReCode, a
fine-grained retrieval-augmented in-context learning framework designed for
accurate and efficient code repair. Specifically, ReCode introduces two key
innovations: (1) an algorithm-aware retrieval strategy that narrows the search
space using preliminary algorithm type predictions; and (2) a modular
dual-encoder architecture that separately processes code and textual inputs,
enabling fine-grained semantic matching between input and retrieved contexts.
Furthermore, we propose RACodeBench, a new benchmark constructed from
real-world user-submitted buggy code, which addresses the limitations of
synthetic benchmarks and supports realistic evaluation. Experimental results on
RACodeBench and competitive programming datasets demonstrate that ReCode
achieves higher repair accuracy with significantly reduced inference cost,
highlighting its practical value for real-world code repair scenarios.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 分析了2023-2024年约1万个COVID-19相关YouTube视频，发现发布时间、标题关键词、情感分析和视频时长等因素显著影响观众参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究晚期大流行期间COVID-19相关视频的参与模式，了解时间、语言和结构因素如何影响观众互动。

Method: 分析了约10,000个YouTube视频的时间分布、标题词汇频率、描述情感分析以及视频时长分类统计。

Result: 发现工作日发布效果差异明显，"shorts"类视频观看量最高达216万，情感分析显示弱相关但统计显著，不同时长和类型的视频观看量差异显著。

Conclusion: 晚期大流行期间COVID-19视频的参与模式具有明显特征，受发布时间、标题词汇、主题和类型特定时长效应驱动。

Abstract: This work investigated about 10,000 COVID-19-related YouTube videos published
between January 2023 and October 2024 to evaluate how temporal, lexical,
linguistic, and structural factors influenced engagement during the late
pandemic period. Publishing activity showed consistent weekday effects: in the
first window, average views peaked on Mondays at 92,658; in the second, on
Wednesdays at 115,479; and in the third, on Fridays at 84,874, reflecting a
shift in audience attention toward mid- and late week. Lexical analysis of
video titles revealed recurring high-frequency keywords related to COVID-19 and
YouTube features, including COVID, coronavirus, shorts, and live. Frequency
analysis revealed sharp spikes, with COVID appearing in 799 video titles in
August 2024, while engagement analysis showed that videos titled with shorts
attracted very high views, peaking at 2.16 million average views per video in
June 2023. Analysis of sentiment of video descriptions in English showed weak
correlation with views in the raw data (Pearson r = 0.0154, p = 0.2987), but
stronger correlations emerged once outliers were addressed, with Spearman r =
0.110 (p < 0.001) and Pearson r = 0.0925 (p < 0.001). Category-level analysis
of video durations revealed contrasting outcomes: long videos focusing on
people and blogs averaged 209,114 views, short entertainment videos averaged
288,675 views, and medium-to-long news and politics videos averaged 51,309 and
59,226 views, respectively. These results demonstrate that engagement patterns
of COVID-19-related videos on YouTube during the late pandemic followed
distinct characteristics driven by publishing schedules, title vocabulary,
topics, and genre-specific duration effects.

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，所提出的社区欺骗策略具有优越性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为社区欺骗提供了更有效的解决方案，解决了现有方法在评估指标和隐蔽性方面的不足。

Abstract: Community detection in graphs is crucial for understanding the organization
of nodes into densely connected clusters. While numerous strategies have been
developed to identify these clusters, the success of community detection can
lead to privacy and information security concerns, as individuals may not want
their personal information exposed. To address this, community deception
methods have been proposed to reduce the effectiveness of detection algorithms.
Nevertheless, several limitations, such as the rationality of evaluation
metrics and the unnoticeability of attacks, have been ignored in current
deception methods. Therefore, in this work, we first investigate the
limitations of the widely used deception metric, i.e., the decrease of
modularity, through empirical studies. Then, we propose a new deception metric,
and combine this new metric together with the attack budget to model the
unnoticeable community deception task as a multi-objective optimization
problem. To further improve the deception performance, we propose two variant
methods by incorporating the degree-biased and community-biased candidate node
selection mechanisms. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed community deception strategies.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: Traj-MLLM是一个基于多模态大语言模型的通用轨迹分析框架，通过多视图上下文将原始轨迹转换为图像-文本序列，无需训练数据或微调即可在多个任务上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹分析方法存在泛化性问题，要么局限于特定区域训练，要么只适用于少数任务。本文探索利用多模态大语言模型来解决轨迹数据挖掘的通用性问题。

Method: 提出Traj-MLLM框架：1）整合多视图上下文将原始轨迹转换为保持时空特征的图像-文本序列；2）利用MLLMs的推理能力进行轨迹分析；3）提出提示优化方法实现任务自适应。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的实验显示，Traj-MLLM在旅行时间估计、移动性预测、异常检测和交通方式识别任务上分别比最先进基线提升48.05%、15.52%、51.52%和1.83%。

Conclusion: Traj-MLLM首次成功将MLLMs应用于轨迹数据挖掘，无需训练数据或模型微调即可实现跨任务和跨区域的优异性能，为解决轨迹分析泛化问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Building a general model capable of analyzing human trajectories across
different geographic regions and different tasks becomes an emergent yet
important problem for various applications. However, existing works suffer from
the generalization problem, \ie, they are either restricted to train for
specific regions or only suitable for a few tasks. Given the recent advances of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we raise the question: can MLLMs
reform current trajectory data mining and solve the problem? Nevertheless, due
to the modality gap of trajectory, how to generate task-independent multimodal
trajectory representations and how to adapt flexibly to different tasks remain
the foundational challenges. In this paper, we propose \texttt{Traj-MLLM}},
which is the first general framework using MLLMs for trajectory data mining. By
integrating multiview contexts, \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} transforms raw trajectories
into interleaved image-text sequences while preserving key spatial-temporal
characteristics, and directly utilizes the reasoning ability of MLLMs for
trajectory analysis. Additionally, a prompt optimization method is proposed to
finalize data-invariant prompts for task adaptation. Extensive experiments on
four publicly available datasets show that \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by $48.05\%$, $15.52\%$, $51.52\%$, $1.83\%$ on
travel time estimation, mobility prediction, anomaly detection and
transportation mode identification, respectively. \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} achieves
these superior performances without requiring any training data or fine-tuning
the MLLM backbones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在模态级依赖上存在局限，难以对细粒度语义进行关系推理，限制了复杂意图理解的能力。

Method: 使用LLM提取细粒度语义作为指导，采用浅到深的链式思维自主发现、描述和排序语义线索，无需人工先验知识。形式化建模三种基本语义关系类型并分析其相互作用。

Conclusion: LGSRR方法通过利用LLM的广泛知识来增强较小模型的关系推理性能，为复杂意图理解提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding human intents from multimodal signals is critical for analyzing
human behaviors and enhancing human-machine interactions in real-world
scenarios. However, existing methods exhibit limitations in their
modality-level reliance, constraining relational reasoning over fine-grained
semantics for complex intent understanding. This paper proposes a novel
LLM-Guided Semantic Relational Reasoning (LGSRR) method, which harnesses the
expansive knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to establish semantic
foundations that boost smaller models' relational reasoning performance.
Specifically, an LLM-based strategy is proposed to extract fine-grained
semantics as guidance for subsequent reasoning, driven by a shallow-to-deep
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) that autonomously uncovers, describes, and ranks
semantic cues by their importance without relying on manually defined priors.
Besides, we formally model three fundamental types of semantic relations
grounded in logical principles and analyze their nuanced interplay to enable
more effective relational reasoning. Extensive experiments on multimodal intent
and dialogue act recognition tasks demonstrate LGSRR's superiority over
state-of-the-art methods, with consistent performance gains across diverse
semantic understanding scenarios. The complete data and code are available at

TL;DR: KG-RAG是一个基于知识图谱的检索增强生成框架，通过将碎片化的UI转换图转化为结构化向量数据库，显著提升移动GUI代理在复杂任务中的表现，成功率提高8.9%，决策准确率提升8.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于大语言模型的GUI代理在处理复杂移动任务时受限于应用特定知识的不足，而UI转换图(UTG)虽然提供了结构化导航表示，但由于提取质量差和集成效率低而未被充分利用。

Method: 提出KG-RAG框架：1) 将碎片化UTG转换为结构化向量数据库；2) 采用意图引导的LLM搜索方法；3) 生成可操作的导航路径来增强代理决策。

Result: 在多样化移动应用中，KG-RAG实现75.8%的成功率（比AutoDroid提升8.9%），84.6%的决策准确率（提升8.1%），平均任务步骤从4.5减少到4.1。同时展示了在网页/桌面端的良好迁移性。

Conclusion: KG-RAG有效解决了移动GUI代理的知识获取和利用问题，UTG成本消融实验表明复杂应用约4小时即可达到准确率饱和，为实际部署提供了可行的权衡方案。

Abstract: Despite recent progress, Graphic User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Large
Language Models (LLMs) struggle with complex mobile tasks due to limited
app-specific knowledge. While UI Transition Graphs (UTGs) offer structured
navigation representations, they are underutilized due to poor extraction and
inefficient integration. We introduce KG-RAG, a Knowledge Graph-driven
Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework that transforms fragmented UTGs into
structured vector databases for efficient real-time retrieval. By leveraging an
intent-guided LLM search method, KG-RAG generates actionable navigation paths,
enhancing agent decision-making. Experiments across diverse mobile apps show
that KG-RAG outperforms existing methods, achieving a 75.8% success rate (8.9%
improvement over AutoDroid), 84.6% decision accuracy (8.1% improvement), and
reducing average task steps from 4.5 to 4.1. Additionally, we present
KG-Android-Bench and KG-Harmony-Bench, two benchmarks tailored to the Chinese
mobile ecosystem for future research. Finally, KG-RAG transfers to web/desktop
(+40% SR on Weibo-web; +20% on QQ Music-desktop), and a UTG cost ablation shows
accuracy saturates at ~4h per complex app, enabling practical deployment
trade-offs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药品短缺对患者护理和医疗系统构成严重风险，但由于制药供应链中存在根本性的信息不对称问题，监管干预措施的有效性一直难以评估。

Method: 开发了基于大型语言模型的多智能体仿真框架ShortageSim，通过顺序生产游戏模拟FDA短缺警报在供应链中的传播，以及其对产能投资和采购决策的影响。

Result: 在历史短缺事件上的实验表明，ShortageSim将停产披露案例的解决滞后百分比降低了83%，模拟持续时间更接近真实情况。

Conclusion: ShortageSim为设计和测试复杂、信息稀缺供应链中的干预措施提供了一个新颖的计算框架，并开源了框架和2925个FDA短缺事件数据集。

Abstract: Drug shortages pose critical risks to patient care and healthcare systems
worldwide, yet the effectiveness of regulatory interventions remains poorly
understood due to fundamental information asymmetries in pharmaceutical supply
chains. We present \textbf{ShortageSim}, the first Large Language Model
(LLM)-based multi-agent simulation framework that captures the complex,
strategic interactions between drug manufacturers, institutional buyers, and
regulatory agencies in response to shortage alerts. Unlike traditional
game-theoretic models that assume perfect rationality and complete information,
\textbf{ShortageSim} leverages LLMs to simulate bounded-rational
decision-making under uncertainty. Through a sequential production game
spanning multiple quarters, we model how FDA announcements, both reactive
alerts about existing shortages and proactive warnings about potential
disruptions, propagate through the supply chain and influence capacity
investment and procurement decisions. Our experiments on historical shortage
events reveal that \textbf{ShortageSim} reduces the resolution-lag percentage
for discontinued-disclosed cases by 83\%, bringing simulated durations more
aligned to ground truth than the zero-shot baseline. We open-source
\textbf{ShortageSim} and a dataset of 2,925 FDA shortage events at
https://github.com/Lemutisme/Sortage_Management, providing a novel
computational framework for designing and testing interventions in complex,
information-scarce supply chains.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), GUI-based mobile
agents have emerged as a key development direction for intelligent mobile
systems. However, existing agent models continue to face significant challenges
in real-world task execution, particularly in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
To address these limitations, we propose MobiAgent, a comprehensive mobile

models, the AgentRR acceleration framework, and the MobiFlow benchmarking
suite. Furthermore, recognizing that the capabilities of current mobile agents
are still limited by the availability of high-quality data, we have developed
an AI-assisted agile data collection pipeline that significantly reduces the
cost of manual annotation. Compared to both general-purpose LLMs and
specialized GUI agent models, MobiAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance

Motivation: 相变材料的功能性质受到纳米级组成和结构异质性的强烈影响，但传统技术难以解析这些微观特征。

Method: 采用无监督机器学习方法，包括PCA降维、t-SNE/UMAP群集验证、k-means群集优化，对4D-STEM行射数据进行分析。

Result: 识别出四个明确群集：群集1（氧和锌富集）、群集2（碳富集）、群集3（锰富集）、群集4（锌富集），并确认了结构变化。

Conclusion: 群集分析为相变材料的局部化学和结构特征关联提供了强大框架，揭示了其本质异质性。

Abstract: Phase-change materials (PCMs) such as Ge-Sb-Te alloys are widely used in
non-volatile memory applications due to their rapid and reversible switching
between amorphous and crystalline states. However, their functional properties
are strongly governed by nanoscale variations in composition and structure,
which are challenging to resolve using conventional techniques. Here, we apply
unsupervised machine learning to 4-dimensional scanning transmission electron
microscopy (4D-STEM) data to identify compositional and structural
heterogeneity in Ge-Sb-Te. After preprocessing and dimensionality reduction
with principal component analysis (PCA), cluster validation was performed with
t-SNE and UMAP, followed by k-means clustering optimized through silhouette
scoring. Four distinct clusters were identified which were mapped back to the
diffraction data. Elemental intensity histograms revealed chemical signatures
change across clusters, oxygen and germanium enrichment in Cluster 1, tellurium
in Cluster 2, antimony in Cluster 3, and germanium again in Cluster 4.
Furthermore, averaged diffraction patterns from these clusters confirmed
structural variations. Together, these findings demonstrate that clustering
analysis can provide a powerful framework for correlating local chemical and
structural features in PCMs, offering deeper insights into their intrinsic
heterogeneity.

Abstract: Recent developments in applied mathematics increasingly employ machine
learning (ML)-particularly supervised learning-to accelerate numerical
computations, such as solving nonlinear partial differential equations. In this
work, we extend such techniques to objects of a more theoretical nature: the
classification and structural analysis of fractal sets. Focusing on the
Mandelbrot and Julia sets as principal examples, we demonstrate that supervised
learning methods-including Classification and Regression Trees (CART),
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), and Recurrent Neural
Networks using both Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM), Random Forests (RF), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-can
classify fractal points with significantly higher predictive accuracy and
substantially lower computational cost than traditional numerical approaches,
such as the thresholding technique. These improvements are consistent across a
range of models and evaluation metrics. Notably, KNN and RF exhibit the best
overall performance, and comparative analyses between models (e.g., KNN vs.
LSTM) suggest the presence of novel regularity properties in these mathematical
structures. Collectively, our findings indicate that ML not only enhances
classification efficiency but also offers promising avenues for generating new
insights, intuitions, and conjectures within pure mathematics.

Abstract: Human cognition is profoundly shaped by the environments in which it unfolds.
Yet, it remains an open question whether learning and decision making can be
explained as a principled adaptation to the statistical structure of real-world
tasks. We introduce ecologically rational analysis, a computational framework
that unifies the normative foundations of rational analysis with ecological
grounding. Leveraging large language models to generate ecologically valid
cognitive tasks at scale, and using meta-learning to derive rational models
optimized for these environments, we develop a new class of learning
algorithms: Ecologically Rational Meta-learned Inference (ERMI). ERMI
internalizes the statistical regularities of naturalistic problem spaces and
adapts flexibly to novel situations, without requiring hand-crafted heuristics
or explicit parameter updates. We show that ERMI captures human behavior across
15 experiments spanning function learning, category learning, and decision
making, outperforming several established cognitive models in trial-by-trial
prediction. Our results suggest that much of human cognition may reflect
adaptive alignment to the ecological structure of the problems we encounter in
everyday life.

visual exploration tasks. For this purpose, a novel methodology is introduced,
combining classic fixation/saccade oculomotor features (e.g., saccade count,
fixation duration, scanned area) with features derived from gaze clusters
(i.e., regions with a considerable accumulation of fixations). These features
are automatically extracted from six exploration tests and evaluated using
different machine learning classifiers. A Mixture of Experts ensemble is used
to integrate outputs across tests and both eyes. Results show that ensemble
models outperform individual classifiers, achieving an Area Under the Receiving
Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.95 on a held-out test set. The
findings support visual exploration as a non-invasive tool for early automatic
screening of PD.

Conclusion: DCA提供了一个强大的个体化大脑图谱生成框架，在多个评估指标和实际应用中均优于现有最先进方法，具有很好的通用性和灵活性。

Abstract: Brain atlases are essential for reducing the dimensionality of neuroimaging
data and enabling interpretable analysis. However, most existing atlases are
predefined, group-level templates with limited flexibility and resolution. We
present Deep Cluster Atlas (DCA), a graph-guided deep embedding clustering
framework for generating individualized, voxel-wise brain parcellations. DCA
combines a pretrained autoencoder with spatially regularized deep clustering to
produce functionally coherent and spatially contiguous regions. Our method
supports flexible control over resolution and anatomical scope, and generalizes
to arbitrary brain structures. We further introduce a standardized benchmarking
platform for atlas evaluation, using multiple large-scale fMRI datasets. Across
multiple datasets and scales, DCA outperforms state-of-the-art atlases,
improving functional homogeneity by 98.8\% and silhouette coefficient by 29\%,
and achieves superior performance in downstream tasks such as autism diagnosis
and cognitive decoding. Codes and models will be released soon.

### [762] [Newton-Flow Particle Filters based on Generalized Cramér Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00182)
*Uwe D. Hanebeck*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出一种永不退化的递归粒子滤波器，通过同伦连续性和牛顿流方法平滑地将粒子从先验密度移动到后验密度，适用于高维问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维粒子滤波中的退化问题，传统方法在测量更新步骤中容易发生粒子退化，需要设计一种固有地永不退化的滤波器。

Method: 使用确定性低差异粒子集表示状态估计，通过同伦连续性逐步引入似然函数，推导出可微分且对粒子顺序不变的广义Cramér距离，利用牛顿流最小化该距离。

Result: 新滤波器实现简单高效，仅需先验粒子集和似然函数，无需从样本估计密度，可作为经典方法的插件替代方案。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了高维粒子滤波的退化问题，提供了一种简单有效的非线性滤波解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a recursive particle filter for high-dimensional problems that
inherently never degenerates. The state estimate is represented by
deterministic low-discrepancy particle sets. We focus on the measurement update
step, where a likelihood function is used for representing the measurement and
its uncertainty. This likelihood is progressively introduced into the filtering
procedure by homotopy continuation over an artificial time. A generalized
Cram\'er distance between particle sets is derived in closed form that is
differentiable and invariant to particle order. A Newton flow then continually
minimizes this distance over artificial time and thus smoothly moves particles
from prior to posterior density. The new filter is surprisingly simple to
implement and very efficient. It just requires a prior particle set and a
likelihood function, never estimates densities from samples, and can be used as
a plugin replacement for classic approaches.

Result: 证明了帕累托最优分布可以通过重整化群方法获得，并提出了参数流概念来简化计算。

Conclusion: 该工作连接了概率论、信息论和统计力学的思想，为处理层次结构问题提供了新的理论框架和计算方法。

Abstract: Hierarchical structures, which include multiple levels, are prevalent in
statistical and machine-learning models as well as physical systems. Extending
the foundational result that the maximum entropy distribution under mean
constraints is given by the exponential Gibbs-Boltzmann form, we introduce the
framework of "hierarchical maximum entropy" to address these multilevel models.
We demonstrate that Pareto optimal distributions, which maximize entropies
across all levels of hierarchical transformations, can be obtained via
renormalization-group procedures from theoretical physics. This is achieved by
formulating multilevel extensions of the Gibbs variational principle and the
Donsker-Varadhan variational representation of entropy. Moreover, we explore
settings with hierarchical invariances that significantly simplify the
renormalization-group procedures, enhancing computational efficiency: quadratic
modular loss functions, logarithmic loss functions, and nearest-neighbor loss
functions. This is accomplished through the introduction of the concept of
parameter flows, which serves as an analog to renormalization flows in
renormalization group theory. This work connects ideas from probability theory,
information theory, and statistical mechanics.

Motivation: 定量组测试(QGT)问题中，信息理论表明自适应方法可能将查询次数减少一半，但现有算法均未突破非自适应边界，自适应方法的实际效益仍是开放问题。

Method: 将QGT问题转化为维度与稀疏性而非环境大小相关的整数向量恢复任务，然后将其建模为离线强化学习问题，使用决策变换器进行自适应求解。

Result: 实验表明，该方法首次实现了平均查询次数低于著名的非自适应信息理论下界，证明了自适应确实可以减少查询次数。

Conclusion: 通过结合维度缩减和决策变换器，本文成功开发出有效的端到端自适应QGT算法，首次实证验证了自适应在减少查询次数方面的优势。

Abstract: We consider the problem of quantitative group testing (QGT), where the goal
is to recover a sparse binary vector from aggregate subset-sum queries: each
query selects a subset of indices and returns the sum of those entries.
Information-theoretic results suggest that adaptivity could yield up to a
twofold reduction in the total number of required queries, yet no algorithm has
surpassed the non-adaptive bound, leaving its practical benefit an open
question. In this paper, we reduce the QGT problem to an integer-vector
recovery task whose dimension scales with the sparsity of the original problem
rather than its full ambient size. We then formulate this reduced recovery task
as an offline reinforcement learning problem and employ Decision Transformers
to solve it adaptively. By combining these two steps, we obtain an effective
end-to-end method for solving the QGT problem. Our experiments show that, for
the first time in the literature, our adaptive algorithm reduces the average
number of queries below the well-known non-adaptive information-theoretic
bound, demonstrating that adaptivity can indeed reduce the number of queries.

Abstract: We consider the problem of repetitive scenario design where one has to solve
repeatedly a scenario design problem and can adjust the sample size (number of
scenarios) to obtain a desired level of risk (constraint violation
probability). We propose an approach to learn on the fly the optimal sample
size based on observed data consisting in previous scenario solutions and their
risk level. Our approach consists in learning a function that represents the
pdf (probability density function) of the risk as a function of the sample
size. Once this function is known, retrieving the optimal sample size is
straightforward. We prove the soundness and convergence of our approach to
obtain the optimal sample size for the class of fixed-complexity scenario
problems, which generalizes fully-supported convex scenario programs that have
been studied extensively in the scenario optimization literature. We also
demonstrate the practical efficiency of our approach on a series of challenging
repetitive scenario design problems, including non-fixed-complexity problems,
nonconvex constraints and time-varying distributions.

Abstract: As a promising physical layer security technique, physical layer key
generation (PLKG) enables legitimate users to obtain secret keys from wireless
channel without security infrastructures. However, in harsh propagation
environments, the channel characteristic becomes unsatisfactory, the key
generation rate (KGR) is significantly deteriorated. In this paper, we propose
a novel fluid antenna (FA) enabled PLKG system to address this challenge.
Specifically, we first derive the closed-form expression of the KGR for FA
array, and then jointly optimize the precoding matrix and the antenna positions
via a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Next, to further reduce the
computational complexity of the optimization procedure, we develop an
alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, which combines the projected gradient
descent (PGD) and the PSO. Simulation results demonstrate that by exploiting
the additional spatial degree of freedom (DoF), our FA enabled PLKG system is
superior to the benchmarks, such as the conventional fixed-position antenna
(FPA) array and the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). It is worth
highlighting that compared to the conventional uniform planar antenna (UPA),
the FA enabled PLKG achieves a 35.42\% KGR performance improvement under PSO
algorithm and a 67.73\% KGR performance improvement under AO algorithm,
respectively.

Conclusion: 该方法证明了从传统实验室诊断向家庭自动化解决方案过渡的可行性，能改善患者预后并提高睡眠障碍诊断的可及性

Abstract: Sleep apnea, a prevalent sleep disorder, involves repeated episodes of
breathing interruptions during sleep, leading to various health complications,
including cognitive impairments, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke,
and even death. One of the main challenges in diagnosing and treating sleep
apnea is identifying individuals at risk. The current gold standard for
diagnosis, Polysomnography (PSG), is costly, labor intensive, and inconvenient,
often resulting in poor quality sleep data. This paper presents a novel
approach to the detection of sleep apnea using a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) trained on single channel EEG data. The proposed CNN achieved an accuracy
of 85.1% and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.22, demonstrating a
significant potential for home based applications by addressing the limitations
of PSG in automated sleep apnea detection. Key contributions of this work also
include the development of a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline with an
Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) Butterworth filter, a dataset construction
method providing broader temporal context, and the application of SMOTETomek to
address class imbalance. This research underscores the feasibility of
transitioning from traditional laboratory based diagnostics to more accessible,
automated home based solutions, improving patient outcomes and broadening the
accessibility of sleep disorder diagnostics.

experimental verification: traditional ones trained using binary cross-entropy
loss and Wasserstein GANs (WGANs). For the generator, two architectures, a
convolutional autoencoder, and a convolutional U-Net, are tested. The
experiment results have shown that the proposed approach allows for an accurate
translation, enabling the use of wrist sensor inertial signals for efficient,

Conclusion: 非相同扩散模型能够更好地表征噪声输入中每个元素的可靠性，特别适用于初始化存在偏差的场景，为无线信道生成提供了更精确的解决方案

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion model, termed the non-identical diffusion model,
and investigate its application to wireless orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) channel generation. Unlike the standard diffusion model
that uses a scalar-valued time index to represent the global noise level, we
extend this notion to an element-wise time indicator to capture local error
variations more accurately. Non-identical diffusion enables us to characterize
the reliability of each element (e.g., subcarriers in OFDM) within the noisy
input, leading to improved generation results when the initialization is
biased. Specifically, we focus on the recovery of wireless multi-input
multi-output (MIMO) OFDM channel matrices, where the initial channel estimates
exhibit highly uneven reliability across elements due to the pilot scheme.
Conventional time embeddings, which assume uniform noise progression, fail to
capture such variability across pilot schemes and noise levels. We introduce a
matrix that matches the input size to control element-wise noise progression.
Following a similar diffusion procedure to existing methods, we show the
correctness and effectiveness of the proposed non-identical diffusion scheme
both theoretically and numerically. For MIMO-OFDM channel generation, we
propose a dimension-wise time embedding strategy. We also develop and evaluate
multiple training and generation methods and compare them through numerical
experiments.

Abstract: To support cooperative perception (CP) of networked mobile agents in dynamic
scenarios, the efficient and robust transmission of sensory data is a critical
challenge. Deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) has
demonstrated promising results for image transmission under adverse channel
conditions, outperforming traditional rule-based codecs. While recent works
have explored to combine JSCC with the widely adopted multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) technology, these approaches are still limited to the
discrete-time analog transmission (DTAT) model and simple tasks. Given the
limited performance of existing MIMO JSCC schemes in supporting complex CP
tasks for networked mobile agents with digital MIMO communication systems, this
paper presents a Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-based task-driven MIMO system
for image transmission, referred to as SoM-MIMO. By leveraging the structural
properties of the feature pyramid for perceptual tasks and the channel
properties of the closed-loop MIMO communication system, SoM-MIMO enables
efficient and robust digital MIMO transmission of images. Experimental results
have shown that compared with two JSCC baseline schemes, our approach achieves
average mAP improvements of 6.30 and 10.48 across all SNR levels, while
maintaining identical communication overhead.

Abstract: Earthquake prediction has long been one of the most elusive challenges in
science. Laboratory experiments and simulations suggest that failure precursors
should exist, yet reliable signals have remained unobserved in real-world
seismic records, leaving open the question of whether they are absent in nature
or simply hidden within noise. Here we introduce a stress-sensitive
frequency-domain transformation that tracks energy differences between adjacent
frequency bands, isolating subtle spectral changes linked to evolving shear and
normal stress. Applied to both laboratory acoustic emission data and seismic
records from seven major earthquakes (Mw 5.9-9.0), including the 2011 Tohoku
and 2023 Turkey-Syria events, the transform consistently reveals precursory
signatures, arc-like trajectories and accelerations toward extrema, emerging
hours to days before rupture. These features are robust across diverse tectonic
settings, from induced seismicity and volcanic collapse to continental
strike-slip and subduction megathrust earthquakes. Our findings demonstrate
that hidden precursors are indeed encoded in ambient seismic noise, offering a
pathway toward real-time fault monitoring and actionable short-term earthquake
forecasting.

Here we present a framework that apply XAI method at point-scale to provide

this approach. Soil moisture and its movement generated by physically based
hydrologic model were used to train a long short-term memory (LSTM) network,
whose impacts of inputs were evaluated by XAI methods. Our results suggest that
XAI-based classification can effectively identify the differences in the
functional roles of various sub-regions at watershed scale. The aggregated XAI
results provide an explicit and quantitative indicator of hydrologic
connectivity development, offering insights to streamflow variation. This
framework could be used to facilitate aggregation of other hydrologic responses

Conclusion: RAMS是算子学习中第一个高效的自适应采样方法，标志着SciML领域的重大进展。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators, two leading
scientific machine learning (SciML) paradigms, have emerged as powerful tools
for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Although increasing the
training sample size generally enhances network performance, it also increases
computational costs for physics-informed or data-driven training. To address
this trade-off, different sampling strategies have been developed to sample
more points in regions with high PDE residuals. However, existing sampling
methods are computationally demanding for high-dimensional problems, such as
high-dimensional PDEs or operator learning tasks. Here, we propose a
residual-based adversarial-gradient moving sample (RAMS) method, which moves
samples according to the adversarial gradient direction to maximize the PDE
residual via gradient-based optimization. RAMS can be easily integrated into
existing sampling methods. Extensive experiments, ranging from PINN applied to
high-dimensional PDEs to physics-informed and data-driven operator learning
problems, have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of RAMS.
Notably, RAMS represents the first efficient adaptive sampling approach for
operator learning, marking a significant advancement in the SciML field.

Abstract: In response to recent FIA regulations reducing Formula 1 team wind tunnel
hours (from 320 hours for last-place teams to 200 hours for championship
leaders) and strict budget caps of 135 million USD per year, more efficient
aerodynamic development tools are needed by teams. Conventional computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, though offering high fidelity results,
require large computational resources with typical simulation durations of 8-24
hours per configuration analysis. This article proposes a Physics-Informed
Neural Network (PINN) for the fast prediction of Formula 1 front wing
aerodynamic coefficients. The suggested methodology combines CFD simulation
data from SimScale with first principles of fluid dynamics through a hybrid
loss function that constrains both data fidelity and physical adherence based
on Navier-Stokes equations. Training on force and moment data from 12
aerodynamic features, the PINN model records coefficient of determination
(R-squared) values of 0.968 for drag coefficient and 0.981 for lift coefficient
prediction while lowering computational time. The physics-informed framework
guarantees that predictions remain adherent to fundamental aerodynamic
principles, offering F1 teams an efficient tool for the fast exploration of
design space within regulatory constraints.

*Jannick Kehls,Ellen Kuhl,Tim Brepols,Kevin Linka,Hagen Holthusen*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: 提出基于自动编码器的非侵入式降阶建模框架，通过三阶段方法压缩高维有限元解，实现从参数到全场解的直接重建，并扩展支持力增强和多场耦合预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在连续介质力学降阶建模中存在局限性，需要开发非侵入式框架来高效处理高维解空间，同时支持多物理场耦合和边界力预测。

Method: 三阶段框架：1) 无监督自动编码器压缩高维解到潜在空间；2) 监督回归网络映射参数到潜在编码；3) 端到端代理模型从输入参数直接重建全场解。扩展包括力增强变体和多场架构。

Result: 在非线性基准问题（异质复合材料、各向异性弹性、热力耦合）上验证，均能准确重建高保真解，保持完全非侵入性。

Conclusion: 深度学习与降维结合可构建高效可扩展的代理模型，为不确定性量化、优化和数字孪生应用提供基础。

Abstract: We propose a non-intrusive, Autoencoder-based framework for reduced-order
modeling in continuum mechanics. Our method integrates three stages: (i) an
unsupervised Autoencoder compresses high-dimensional finite element solutions
into a compact latent space, (ii) a supervised regression network maps problem
parameters to latent codes, and (iii) an end-to-end surrogate reconstructs
full-field solutions directly from input parameters.
  To overcome limitations of existing approaches, we propose two key
extensions: a force-augmented variant that jointly predicts displacement fields
and reaction forces at Neumann boundaries, and a multi-field architecture that
enables coupled field predictions, such as in thermo-mechanical systems. The
framework is validated on nonlinear benchmark problems involving heterogeneous
composites, anisotropic elasticity with geometric variation, and
thermo-mechanical coupling. Across all cases, it achieves accurate
reconstructions of high-fidelity solutions while remaining fully non-intrusive.
  These results highlight the potential of combining deep learning with
dimensionality reduction to build efficient and extensible surrogate models.
Our publicly available implementation provides a foundation for integrating
data-driven model order reduction into uncertainty quantification,
optimization, and digital twin applications.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: KVComp是一个针对长文本生成的KV缓存管理框架，通过创新的有损压缩技术显著减少内存使用，同时保持模型精度和高计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer大语言模型在长上下文推理时面临KV缓存内存需求巨大的挑战，可能达到GB级别，限制了实际应用

Method: 采用专门为KV缓存数据特性设计的损失压缩技术，结合压缩算法和系统架构的协同设计，保持与KV缓存增长特性的兼容性

Result: 平均实现47%的内存减少率，最高可达83%，几乎没有模型精度损失，执行吞吐量极高，在某些情况下甚至加速矩阵向量乘法操作

Conclusion: KVComp提供了一个通用高效的KV缓存管理解决方案，在长文本生成场景中显著优于现有方法，具有良好的实际应用价值

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive
potential in various practical applications. However, long context inference
poses a significant challenge due to the enormous memory requirements of the
key-value (KV) cache, which can scale to multiple gigabytes as sequence length
and batch size increase. In this paper, we present KVComp, a generic and
efficient KV cache management framework optimized for long-text generation that
synergistically works with both latency-critical and throughput-critical
inference systems. KVComp employs novel lossy compression techniques
specifically designed for KV cache data characteristics, featuring careful
co-design of compression algorithms and system architecture. Our approach
maintains compatibility with the growing nature of KV cache while preserving
high computational efficiency. Experimental results show that KVComp achieves
on average 47\% and up to 83\% higher memory reduction rate compared to
existing methods with little/no model accuracy degradation. Furthermore, KVComp
achieves extremely high execution throughput, effectively reducing
decompression overhead and, in some cases, even accelerating the matrix-vector
multiplication operation and outperform cuBLAS-based attention kernels with
less data movement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 延迟关键应用在超标量处理器中由于缓存未命中和预测错误导致功能单元利用率低，而SMT技术由于对单线程性能的影响很少用于这类重线程应用

Method: 扩展Cursor IDE中的AI编码代理，通过模型上下文协议连接额外工具，实现LLM指导的热点检测、动态二进制插桩收集依赖关系、SMT感知性能模拟

Result: 使用Aira和Relic并行框架对工业级延迟关键基准测试进行并行化，获得了17%的几何平均性能提升

Conclusion: Aira系统成功证明了AI驱动的并行化方法可以有效利用SMT技术提升延迟关键应用的性能，为这类应用的细粒度并行化提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Latency-critical applications tend to show low utilization of functional
units due to frequent cache misses and mispredictions during speculative
execution in high-performance superscalar processors. However, due to
significant impact on single-thread performance, Simultaneous Multithreading
(SMT) technology is rarely used with heavy threads of latency-critical
applications. In this paper, we explore utilization of SMT technology to
support fine-grained parallelization of latency-critical applications.
Following the advancements in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs),
we introduce Aira, an AI-powered Parallelization Adviser. To implement Aira, we
extend AI Coding Agent in Cursor IDE with additional tools connected through
Model Context Protocol, enabling end-to-end AI Agent for parallelization.
Additional connected tools enable LLM-guided hotspot detection, collection of
dynamic dependencies with Dynamic Binary Instrumentation, SMT-aware performance
simulation to estimate performance gains. We apply Aira with Relic parallel
framework for fine-grained task parallelism on SMT cores to parallelize
latency-critical benchmarks representing real-world applications used in
industry. We show 17% geomean performance gain from parallelization of
latency-critical benchmarks using Aira with Relic framework.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: DSDE是一个无需训练的框架，通过KL散度方差预测信号和自适应推测长度上限，在批量服务环境中实现动态推测解码优化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码依赖固定推测长度，在批量服务环境中面对多样化请求时表现不佳，需要动态适应机制

Method: 提出DSDE框架，包含两个核心组件：1）基于KL散度方差的预测信号诊断生成区域稳定性；2）自适应推测长度上限解决序列解码中的滞后问题

Result: 实验显示基于KL散度的稳定性信号在动态适应方面具有潜力，算法在端到端延迟上与领先基线竞争，并在多样化工作负载下表现出优越的鲁棒性

Conclusion: 后验信号是构建更鲁棒智能LLM推理系统的重要组件，为动态推测长度适应的未来研究指明了有前景的方向

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates large language model inference, but its
reliance on a fixed speculation length is suboptimal in large-batch serving
environments with diverse requests. This paper explores a new direction for
dynamic adaptation by investigating a novel class of post-hoc, diagnostic
signals. We propose Dynamic Speculative Decoding Engine (DSDE), a training-free
framework built on two primary components: (1) a predictive signal based on the
variance of the Kullback-Leibler (KLD) divergence, which diagnoses the
generation's regional stability, and (2) an adaptive speculation length cap to
mitigate the straggler problem in per-sequence decoding. Experiments
demonstrate the potential of using KLD-based stability signals for dynamic
adaptation. An algorithm guided by these signals achieves end-to-end latency
competitive with leading baselines and exhibits superior robustness across
diverse workloads. This robustness is particularly valuable in challenging
low-acceptance-rate regimes, where the proposed signal maintains its diagnostic
utility. Collectively, these findings validate post-hoc signals as a valuable
component for building more robust and intelligent LLM inference systems, and
highlight a promising direction for future research on dynamic speculation
length adaptation.

TL;DR: LiquidGEMM是一个硬件高效的W4A8 GEMM内核，通过LiquidQuant量化方法和隐式细粒度流水线技术，在LLM推理中实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的W4A8 GEMM内核在实际应用中效率不足，主要因为CUDA核心上的反量化操作无法跟上Tensor Core的高吞吐量，导致性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出了LiquidQuant硬件高效量化方法（每4个元素仅需2条算术指令实现快速、溢出安全的反量化）和隐式细粒度流水线技术（在warp组间完全重叠权重加载、反量化和矩阵乘法操作）。

Result: 实验结果显示：比最先进的W4A8内核快2.90倍，端到端系统级加速达4.94倍；相比NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM中的量化GEMM内核，性能提升1.12-1.63倍，系统级加速达1.63倍。

Conclusion: LiquidGEMM通过创新的量化方法和流水线设计，有效解决了W4A8量化在LLM推理中的性能瓶颈问题，为高效LLM服务提供了硬件高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Quantization is a critical technique for accelerating LLM inference by
reducing memory footprint and improving computational efficiency. Among various
schemes, 4-bit weight and 8-bit activation quantization (W4A8) offers a strong
balance between accuracy and performance. However, existing W4A8 GEMM kernels
fall short in practice due to inefficient dequantization on CUDA Cores, which
cannot keep pace with the high throughput of Tensor Cores. In this paper, we
present LiquidGEMM, a hardware-efficient W4A8 GEMM kernel for efficient LLM
serving. LiquidGEMM designs two key techniques: LiquidQuant, a
hardware-efficient quantization method that enables fast, overflow-safe
dequantization using just two arithmetic instructions per four elements; and an
implicit fine-grained pipeline that fully overlaps weight loading,
dequantization, and MMA across warp groups without software synchronization or
redundant memory traffic. Experimental results show that LiquidGEMM achieves up
to 2.90x speedup over state-of-the-art W4A8 kernels and up to 4.94x end-to-end
system-level speedup. Compared to various quantized GEMM kernels in NVIDIA
TensorRT-LLM, LiquidGEMM delivers 1.12-1.63x performance gains, and achieves up
to 1.63x system-level speedup.

TL;DR: PyramidAI是一种分析千兆像素图像的技术，通过渐进式分辨率分析和自适应区域选择，在保持精度的同时将计算量减少2.65倍，使单台计算机上的分析时间从超过1小时缩短到几分钟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 千兆像素图像分析计算需求巨大，需要开发能够降低计算成本的技术，使主流计算机也能进行高效的大规模图像分析。

Method: 采用渐进式分析方法，从低分辨率开始，逐步聚焦到感兴趣区域进行高分辨率详细检查。研究了两种自适应分辨率选择策略来平衡精度与计算性能。

Result: 在Camelyon16生物医学图像数据集上验证，处理数据量减少达2.65倍，同时保持相关区域识别精度。使用12个普通工作节点可将分析时间从超过1小时缩短到几分钟。

Conclusion: PyramidAI为千兆像素图像分析提供了实用的高效解决方案，实现了计算成本的显著降低和性能的大幅提升，使大规模图像分析更加民主化。

Abstract: Analyzing gigapixel images is recognized as computationally demanding. In
this paper, we introduce PyramidAI, a technique for analyzing gigapixel images
with reduced computational cost. The proposed approach adopts a gradual
analysis of the image, beginning with lower resolutions and progressively
concentrating on regions of interest for detailed examination at higher
resolutions. We investigated two strategies for tuning the accuracy-computation
performance trade-off when implementing the adaptive resolution selection,
validated against the Camelyon16 dataset of biomedical images. Our results
demonstrate that PyramidAI substantially decreases the amount of processed data
required for analysis by up to 2.65x, while preserving the accuracy in
identifying relevant sections on a single computer. To ensure democratization
of gigapixel image analysis, we evaluated the potential to use mainstream
computers to perform the computation by exploiting the parallelism potential of
the approach. Using a simulator, we estimated the best data distribution and
load balancing algorithm according to the number of workers. The selected
algorithms were implemented and highlighted the same conclusions in a
real-world setting. Analysis time is reduced from more than an hour to a few
minutes using 12 modest workers, offering a practical solution for efficient
large-scale image analysis.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了一个机器学习框架，用于在TON区块链上去中心化交易所早期检测rug pull骗局，比较了两种不同的rug pull定义方法，在交易前5分钟内有效识别骗局。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TON区块链的独特架构（异步执行和Telegram带来的海量web2用户）为欺诈分析提供了新颖且关键的环境，需要保护投资者并增强TON DeFi生态系统的安全基础设施。

Method: 在TON两大DEX平台Ston.Fi和DeDust上收集数据，融合两个平台数据训练模型。实施并比较两种rug pull定义：TVL-based（灾难性流动性提取）和idle-based（交易活动突然停止）。使用梯度提升模型进行检测。

Result: 梯度提升模型能在交易前5分钟内有效识别rug pull，TVL-based方法AUC最高达0.891，idle-based方法在召回率方面表现优异。特征集在不同交易所间一致但分布差异显著。

Conclusion: 该研究为投资者提供了关键的早期预警机制，增强了TON DeFi生态系统的安全基础设施，同时强调了需要开发针对特定平台的鲁棒模型来处理数据分布差异。

Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning framework for the early detection of
rug pull scams on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) within The Open Network (TON)
blockchain. TON's unique architecture, characterized by asynchronous execution
and a massive web2 user base from Telegram, presents a novel and critical
environment for fraud analysis. We conduct a comprehensive study on the two
largest TON DEXs, Ston.Fi and DeDust, fusing data from both platforms to train
our models. A key contribution is the implementation and comparative analysis
of two distinct rug pull definitions--TVL-based (a catastrophic liquidity
withdrawal) and idle-based (a sudden cessation of all trading activity)--within
a single, unified study. We demonstrate that Gradient Boosting models can
effectively identify rug pulls within the first five minutes of trading, with
the TVL-based method achieving superior AUC (up to 0.891) while the idle-based
method excels at recall. Our analysis reveals that while feature sets are
consistent across exchanges, their underlying distributions differ
significantly, challenging straightforward data fusion and highlighting the
need for robust, platform-aware models. This work provides a crucial
early-warning mechanism for investors and enhances the security infrastructure
of the rapidly growing TON DeFi ecosystem.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: MLP-Offload是一种新颖的多级多路径卸载引擎，专门用于优化资源受限环境下的LLM训练，通过缓解I/O瓶颈实现2.5倍的训练迭代加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM模型规模增长速度超过GPU内存容量，需要多级主机内存或磁盘卸载技术，但现有方法在训练关键路径中产生显著的I/O开销，导致迭代速度变慢

Method: 设计并实现MLP-Offload，通过缓存高效和并发控制的方式在多级存储层之间卸载优化器状态，缓解反向传播和更新阶段的I/O瓶颈

Result: 在高达280B参数的模型评估中，MLP-Offload相比最先进的LLM训练运行时实现了2.5倍的迭代加速

Conclusion: MLP-Offload通过多级多路径卸载策略有效解决了LLM训练中的I/O瓶颈问题，显著提升了大规模模型训练效率

Abstract: Training LLMs larger than the aggregated memory of multiple GPUs is
increasingly necessary due to the faster growth of LLM sizes compared to GPU
memory. To this end, multi-tier host memory or disk offloading techniques are
proposed by state of art. Despite advanced asynchronous multi-tier read/write
strategies, such offloading strategies result in significant I/O overheads in
the critical path of training, resulting in slower iterations. To this end, we
propose MLP-Offload, a novel multi-level, multi-path offloading engine
specifically designed for optimizing LLM training on resource-constrained
setups by mitigating I/O bottlenecks. We make several key observations that
drive the design of MLP-Offload, such as I/O overheads during the update
dominate the iteration time; I/O bandwidth of the third-level remote storage
tier remains unutilized; and, contention due to concurrent offloading amplifies
I/O bottlenecks. Driven by these insights, we design and implement MLP-Offload
to offload the optimizer states across multiple tiers in a cache-efficient and
concurrency-controlled fashion to mitigate I/O bottlenecks during the backward
and update phases. Evaluations on models up to 280B parameters shows that
MLP-Offload achieves 2.5$\times$ faster iterations compared to the
state-of-the-art LLM training runtimes.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in microbial ecology is determining whether bacteria
compete or cooperate in different environmental conditions. With recent
advances in genome-scale metabolic models, we are now capable of simulating
interactions between thousands of pairs of bacteria in thousands of different
environmental settings at a scale infeasible experimentally. These approaches
can generate tremendous amounts of data that can be exploited by
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to uncover the mechanisms driving
interactions. Here, we present Friend or Foe, a compendium of 64 tabular
environmental datasets, consisting of more than 26M shared environments for
more than 10K pairs of bacteria sampled from two of the largest collections of
metabolic models. The Friend or Foe datasets are curated for a wide range of
machine learning tasks -- supervised, unsupervised, and generative -- to
address specific questions underlying bacterial interactions. We benchmarked a
selection of the most recent models for each of these tasks and our results
indicate that machine learning can be successful in this application to
microbial ecology. Going beyond, analyses of the Friend or Foe compendium can
shed light on the predictability of bacterial interactions and highlight novel
research directions into how bacteria infer and navigate their relationships.

Abstract: Trisomy 21 results in Down syndrome, a multifaceted genetic disorder with
diverse clinical phenotypes, including heart defects, immune dysfunction,

translational discovery. The NIH INCLUDE (INvestigation of Co-occurring

assembled harmonized participant-level datasets, yet realizing their potential
requires integrative analytical frameworks. We developed a knowledge
graph-driven platform transforming nine INCLUDE studies, comprising 7,148
participants, 456 conditions, 501 phenotypes, and over 37,000 biospecimens,
into a unified semantic infrastructure. Cross-resource enrichment with Monarch

resulting knowledge graph contains over 1.6 million semantic associations,
enabling AI-ready analysis with graph embeddings and path-based reasoning for
hypothesis generation. Researchers can query the graph via SPARQL or natural

Conclusion: FBMS包提供了强大的贝叶斯模型选择框架，能够有效处理复杂回归问题，具有很好的扩展性和实用性。

Abstract: The FBMS R package facilitates Bayesian model selection and model averaging
in complex regression settings by employing a variety of Monte Carlo model
exploration methods. At its core, the package implements an efficient Mode
Jumping Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MJMCMC) algorithm, designed to improve mixing
in multi-modal posterior landscapes within Bayesian generalized linear models.
In addition, it provides a genetically modified MJMCMC (GMJMCMC) algorithm that
introduces nonlinear feature generation, thereby enabling the estimation of
Bayesian generalized nonlinear models (BGNLMs). Within this framework, the
algorithm maintains and updates populations of transformed features, computes
their posterior probabilities, and evaluates the posteriors of models
constructed from them. We demonstrate the effective use of FBMS for both
inferential and predictive modeling in Gaussian regression, focusing on
different instances of the BGNLM class of models. Furthermore, through a broad
set of applications, we illustrate how the methodology can be extended to
increasingly complex modeling scenarios, extending to other response
distributions and mixed effect models.

Motivation: 传统自适应重要性采样需要优化建议分布，在目标密度评估昂贵时效率低下。需要一种能够最小化目标评估次数的高效采样方法

Method: 结合空间填充设计和多臂老虎机的序列策略，利用高斯过程代理模型指导样本选择，直接设计采样点而非优化建议分布

Result: 在多种采样任务中表现优异，包括多峰分布、重尾分布和贝叶斯推断等实际应用，相比竞争方法使用更少的目标评估获得准确近似

Conclusion: BIS方法为昂贵目标函数评估的场景提供了一种高效的重要性采样解决方案，具有理论收敛保证和实际应用价值

Abstract: We introduce bandit importance sampling (BIS), a new class of importance
sampling methods designed for settings where the target density is expensive to
evaluate. In contrast to adaptive importance sampling, which optimises a
proposal distribution, BIS directly designs the samples through a sequential
strategy that combines space-filling designs with multi-armed bandits. Our
method leverages Gaussian process surrogates to guide sample selection,
enabling efficient exploration of the parameter space with minimal target
evaluations. We establish theoretical guarantees on convergence and demonstrate
the effectiveness of the method across a broad range of sampling tasks. BIS
delivers accurate approximations with fewer target evaluations, outperforming
competing approaches across multimodal, heavy-tailed distributions, and
real-world applications to Bayesian inference of computationally expensive
models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个针对离散响应空间关联的置信区间方法，即使在模型错误设定和空间位置非随机采样的情况下，仍能保证渐近名义覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在估计协变量与二元或计数响应之间的关联时，存在不现实的空间假设，如假设模型正确设定或训练和目标位置独立同分布，而实际中这些位置往往不是随机采样的。

Method: 通过处理空间变化噪声，提出一致性证明的新方法，并利用delta方法和Lyapunov中心极限定理来构建置信区间。

Result: 实证研究表明，标准方法可能产生不可靠的置信区间甚至关联符号错误，而本文方法能可靠提供正确覆盖率。

Conclusion: 该方法为离散响应空间关联分析提供了首个具有理论保证的置信区间构建框架，解决了现有方法在模型错误设定和非随机采样下的局限性。

Abstract: Scientists are often interested in estimating an association between a
covariate and a binary- or count-valued response. For instance, public health
officials are interested in how much disease presence (a binary response per
individual) varies as temperature or pollution (covariates) increases. Many
existing methods can be used to estimate associations, and corresponding
uncertainty intervals, but make unrealistic assumptions in the spatial domain.
For instance, they incorrectly assume models are well-specified. Or they assume
the training and target locations are i.i.d. -- whereas in practice, these
locations are often not even randomly sampled. Some recent work avoids these
assumptions but works only for continuous responses with spatially constant
noise. In the present work, we provide the first confidence intervals with
guaranteed asymptotic nominal coverage for spatial associations given discrete
responses, even under simultaneous model misspecification and nonrandom
sampling of spatial locations. To do so, we demonstrate how to handle spatially
varying noise, provide a novel proof of consistency for our proposed estimator,
and use a delta method argument with a Lyapunov central limit theorem. We show
empirically that standard approaches can produce unreliable confidence
intervals and can even get the sign of an association wrong, while our method
reliably provides correct coverage.

semantic data processing systems (SDPSs) to support declarative queries against
unstructured documents. Existing SDPSs are, however, lacking a unified
algebraic foundation, making their queries difficult to compose, reason, and
optimize. We propose a new semantic algebra, SABER (Semantic Algebra Based on
Extended Relational algebra), opening the possibility of semantic operations'
logical plan construction, optimization, and formal correctness guarantees. We
further propose to implement SABER in a SQL-compatible syntax so that it
natively supports mixed structured/unstructured data processing. With SABER, we
showcase the feasibility of providing a unified interface for existing SDPSs so
that it can effectively mix and match any semantically-compatible operator
implementation from any SDPS, greatly enhancing SABER's applicability for
community contributions.

*Fuheng Zhao,Jiayue Chen,Yiming Pan,Tahseen Rabbani,Divyakant Agrawal,Amr El Abbadi*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文提出了LLM ORDER BY操作符作为逻辑抽象，并研究了其在统一评估框架下的物理实现。实验表明没有单一方法是最优的，效果取决于查询特性和数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在数据处理系统中的广泛应用，需要研究如何有效地利用LLM实现排序操作，但目前缺乏系统性的评估框架和优化方法。

Method: 提出了三种新设计：基于一致性的批处理大小策略、用于成对排序的多数投票机制，以及适用于LLM的双向外部分并排序算法。

Result: 实验显示基于一致性的方法能有效确定批处理大小，多数投票机制在GPT-4o上显著增强成对比较，外部分并排序在准确性和效率之间达到良好平衡。

Conclusion: 研究发现计算成本与排序质量之间存在对数线性关系，这为构建基于LLM的数据系统的成本模型提供了理论基础，表明需要根据具体场景选择不同的排序实现策略。

Abstract: We present the LLM ORDER BY operator as a logical abstraction and study its
physical implementations within a unified evaluation framework. Our experiments
show that no single approach is universally optimal, with effectiveness
depending on query characteristics and data. We introduce three new designs: an
agreement-based batch-size policy, a majority voting mechanism for pairwise
sorting, and a two-way external merge sort adapted for LLMs. With extensive
experiments, our agreement-based procedure is effective at determining batch
size for value-based methods, the majority-voting mechanism consistently
strengthens pairwise comparisons on GPT-4o, and external merge sort achieves
high accuracy-efficiency trade-offs across datasets and models. We further
observe a log-linear scaling between compute cost and ordering quality,
offering the first step toward principled cost models for LLM powered data
systems.

TL;DR: SmartDiff是一个统一的数据差异比较系统，通过模式感知映射、类型特定比较器和并行执行，能够处理模式漂移和异构数据类型，提供可解释的差异分析，在性能和准确性方面显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据差异比较工具在处理模式漂移、异构数据类型和有限可解释性方面存在不足，无法满足数据工程工作流对可靠差异分析的需求。

Method: 结合模式感知映射、类型特定比较器和并行执行，采用LLM辅助的标注管道生成确定性、模式有效的多标签解释，使用检索增强和约束解码技术。

Result: 在百万行数据集上达到95%以上的精确率和召回率，运行速度快30-40%，内存使用减少30-50%，用户研究中根因分析时间从10小时减少到12分钟。

Conclusion: SmartDiff在迁移验证、回归测试、合规审计和持续数据质量监控方面具有实用价值，展示了在数据差异比较领域的显著改进。

Abstract: Data engineering workflows require reliable differencing across files,
databases, and query outputs, yet existing tools falter under schema drift,
heterogeneous types, and limited explainability. SmartDiff is a unified system
that combines schema-aware mapping, type-specific comparators, and parallel
execution. It aligns evolving schemas, compares structured and semi-structured
data (strings, numbers, dates, JSON/XML), and clusters results with labels that
explain how and why differences occur. On multi-million-row datasets, SmartDiff
achieves over 95 percent precision and recall, runs 30 to 40 percent faster,
and uses 30 to 50 percent less memory than baselines; in user studies, it
reduces root-cause analysis time from 10 hours to 12 minutes. An LLM-assisted
labeling pipeline produces deterministic, schema-valid multilabel explanations
using retrieval augmentation and constrained decoding; ablations show further
gains in label accuracy and time to diagnosis over rules-only baselines. These
results indicate SmartDiff's utility for migration validation, regression
testing, compliance auditing, and continuous data quality monitoring. Index

Abstract: Converting natural language queries into SQL queries is a crucial challenge
in both industry and academia, aiming to increase access to databases and
large-scale applications. This work examines how in-context learning and
chain-of-thought can be utilized to develop a robust solution for text-to-SQL
systems. We propose SQL-of-Thought: a multi-agent framework that decomposes the
Text2SQL task into schema linking, subproblem identification, query plan
generation, SQL generation, and a guided correction loop. Unlike prior systems
that rely only on execution-based static correction, we introduce
taxonomy-guided dynamic error modification informed by in-context learning.
SQL-of-Thought achieves state-of-the-art results on the Spider dataset and its
variants, combining guided error taxonomy with reasoning-based query planning.

TL;DR: 本文批判了当前概念建模中过度偏向概念模式（schema-centric）的做法，提出了包含信息基（information base）的包容性建模方法，并展示了新技术如何支持更自动化和经验驱动的实践。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算机科学概念建模实践普遍存在对概念模式的强烈偏见（schema turn），完全忽视了信息基的重要性。本文旨在揭示这种偏见的非根本性，并展示现代技术如何支持更全面的建模方法。

Method: 通过历史分析追溯schema turn的起源，使用bCLEARer作为案例研究，展示基于管道（pipeline-based）的新概念建模技术如何实现schema-and-base的包容性方法。

Result: 证明了schema turn并非概念建模的根本要求，现代技术能够支持包含信息基的建模实践，这为更自动化和经验驱动的建模方法开辟了可能性。

Conclusion: 当前完全排除信息基的schema-centric做法可能只是一个暂时的进化弯路，概念建模实践的空间比当前假设的要宽广得多，未来将需要基于管道的新技术来支持更全面的建模方法。

Abstract: If one looks at contemporary mainstream development practices for conceptual
modelling in computer science, these so clearly focus on a conceptual schema
completely separated from its information base that the conceptual schema is
often just called the conceptual model. These schema-centric practices are
crystallized in almost every database textbook. We call this strong, almost
universal, bias towards conceptual schemas the schema turn. The focus of this
paper is on disentangling this turn within (computer science) conceptual
modeling. It aims to shed some light on how it emerged and so show that it is
not fundamental. To show that modern technology enables the adoption of an
inclusive schema-and-base conceptual modelling approach, which in turn enables
more automated, and empirically motivated practices. And to show, more
generally, the space of possible conceptual modelling practices is wider than
currently assumed. It also uses the example of bCLEARer to show that the
implementations in this wider space will probably need to rely on new
pipeline-based conceptual modelling techniques. So, it is possible that the
schema turn's complete exclusion of the information base could be merely a
temporary evolutionary detour.

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: CERA是一个通过表示对齐实现气候不变编码的机器学习框架，能够在未经+4K气候训练数据的情况下，利用控制气候数据和未标记的温暖气候输入，改善对温暖气候的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习在气候科学应用中难以泛化到训练气候之外的问题，现有方法严重依赖暖气候模型模拟的训练数据，而气候不变输入需要复杂的手工特征工程。

Method: CERA框架包含一个具有显式潜在空间对齐的自编码器，后接一个用于下游过程估计的预测器。通过潜在空间对齐，利用标记的控制气候数据和未标记的温暖气候输入来改善泛化。

Result: CERA在预测关键湿度和能量趋势方面优于原始输入和物理信息基线，能够捕捉湿度趋势的垂直和经向结构，以及降水强度分布（包括极端事件）的变化。潜在对齐提高了准确性和训练随机种子间的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架为手动特征工程提供了一种数据驱动的替代方案，不仅适用于混合ML-物理系统中的参数化，也适用于统计降尺度等其他气候应用，尽管在边界层仍存在一些技能降低。

Abstract: Robust generalization under climate change remains a major challenge for
machine learning applications in climate science. Most existing approaches
struggle to extrapolate beyond the climate they were trained on, leading to a
strong dependence on training data from model simulations of warm climates. Use
of climate-invariant inputs improves generalization but requires challenging
manual feature engineering. Here, we present CERA (Climate-invariant Encoding
through Representation Alignment), a machine learning framework consisting of
an autoencoder with explicit latent-space alignment, followed by a predictor
for downstream process estimation. We test CERA on the problem of
parameterizing moist-physics processes. Without training on labeled data from a
+4K climate, CERA leverages labeled control-climate data and unlabeled
warmer-climate inputs to improve generalization to the warmer climate,
outperforming both raw-input and physically informed baselines in predicting
key moisture and energy tendencies. It captures not only the vertical and
meridional structures of the moisture tendencies, but also shifts in the
intensity distribution of precipitation including extremes. Ablation
experiments show that latent alignment improves both accuracy and the
robustness across random seeds used in training. While some reduced skill
remains in the boundary layer, the framework offers a data-driven alternative
to manual feature engineering of climate invariant inputs. Beyond
parameterizations used in hybrid ML-physics systems, the approach holds promise
for other climate applications such as statistical downscaling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确海洋预报对海洋应用至关重要，但将AI方法扩展到海洋系统面临挑战，因为海洋动力学较慢且边界条件复杂

Method: 基于U-Net架构，增强3D注意力机制，1/24度高分辨率，使用20年再分析数据训练，采用自回归策略生成9天预报，结合历史海洋状态和大气强迫

Result: 在均方根误差和异常相关系数评估中，MedFormer在所有关键3D海洋变量上都持续优于最先进的地中海预报系统(MedFS)

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法如MedFormer在准确性和计算效率方面有潜力补充甚至超越传统数值海洋预报系统

Abstract: Accurate ocean forecasting is essential for supporting a wide range of marine
applications. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have highlighted the
potential of data-driven models to outperform traditional numerical approaches,
particularly in atmospheric weather forecasting. However, extending these
methods to ocean systems remains challenging due to their inherently slower
dynamics and complex boundary conditions. In this work, we present MedFormer, a
fully data-driven deep learning model specifically designed for medium-range
ocean forecasting in the Mediterranean Sea. MedFormer is based on a U-Net
architecture augmented with 3D attention mechanisms and operates at a high
horizontal resolution of 1/24{\deg}. The model is trained on 20 years of daily
ocean reanalysis data and fine-tuned with high-resolution operational analyses.
It generates 9-day forecasts using an autoregressive strategy. The model
leverages both historical ocean states and atmospheric forcings, making it
well-suited for operational use. We benchmark MedFormer against the
state-of-the-art Mediterranean Forecasting System (MedFS), developed at
Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change (CMCC), using both analysis data
and independent observations. The forecast skills, evaluated with the Root Mean
Squared Difference and the Anomaly Correlation Coefficient, indicate that
MedFormer consistently outperforms MedFS across key 3D ocean variables. These
findings underscore the potential of data-driven approaches like MedFormer to
complement, or even surpass, traditional numerical ocean forecasting systems in
both accuracy and computational efficiency.

Motivation: 神经网络天气预报在短期预报中显示出巨大潜力，但将网格化方法应用于瑞士等小尺度、地形复杂地区时，面临计算挑战，特别是在追求高空间（1公里）和时间（10分钟）分辨率的情况下。

Method: 使用图神经网络（GNN）框架Anemoi，结合地面观测数据和选定的过去及未来数值天气预报状态，采用观测引导的插值策略，在保持物理一致性的同时提高短期预报准确性。

Result: GNN模型在长达12小时的预报期内始终优于传统的高分辨率数值天气预报（ICON）和临近预报（INCA）基线方法，特别是在风速和降水预测方面表现突出。通过空间技能评分、事件评估和专业预报员盲测等综合验证程序，证明了该方法在山地地区的业务适用性。

Conclusion: 基于图神经网络的观测引导插值方法为复杂地形地区的高分辨率天气预报提供了有效的解决方案，在短期预报准确性方面显著优于传统数值天气预报方法，具有重要的业务应用价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in neural weather forecasting have shown significant
potential for accurate short-term forecasts. However, adapting such gridded
approaches to smaller, topographically complex regions like Switzerland
introduces computational challenges, especially when aiming for high spatial (1
km) and temporal (10 minutes) resolution. This paper presents a Graph Neural
Network (GNN)-based approach for high-resolution nowcasting in Switzerland
using the Anemoi framework and observational inputs. The proposed model
combines surface observations with selected past and future numerical weather
prediction (NWP) states, enabling an observation-guided interpolation strategy
that enhances short-term accuracy while preserving physical consistency. We
evaluate the method on multiple surface variables and compare it against
operational high-resolution NWP (ICON) and nowcasting (INCA) baselines. The
results show that the GNN model consistently outperforms traditional approaches
in lead times up to 12 hours, especially for wind and precipitation. A
comprehensive verification procedure, including spatial skill scores,
event-based evaluation, and blind tests with professional forecasters,
demonstrates the operational relevance of the approach for mountainous domains.

Motivation: 评估先进AI气象模型在南亚季风这种复杂气候系统中的实际表现，以确定它们是否已做好运营应用的准备

Method: 对7到评估的模型包括FourCastNet、Pangu-Weather、GraphCast等七个先进AI模型，通过与观测数据对比来评估温度、风、动能能谱、附近降水、云盖、气旋轨迹预测等多个指标

Result: AI模型在大规模动力学预测上表现良好，但在地面气象站数据对比中错误显著更高，在中规模动能能谱和极端降水方面存在显著差异，季风期气旋轨迹预测也存在明显不同

Conclusion: ECMWF的AIFS模型表现最为可靠和易用，GraphCast和GenCast次之，但整体上AI气象预测模型在运营应用方面还未完全做好准备

Abstract: Seven state-of-the-art AI weather models (FourCastNet, FourCastNet-SFNO,
Pangu-Weather, GraphCast, Aurora, AIFS, and GenCast) are evaluated against
observational data during the South Asian Monsoon. The models are tested on
temperature, winds, global kinetic energy spectrum, regional precipitation,
cloud cover, cyclone trajectory prediction, and hyperlocal predictions around
extreme weather events. The models forecast large-scale dynamics with
reasonable accuracy, but fall short on key metrics critical to Monsoon-time
weather prediction. The models exhibit substantially higher errors when
compared against ground-based weather station data than against reanalysis or
conventional forecasts. The AI weather prediction models show key differences
in mesoscale kinetic energy and extreme precipitation during the Monsoon, and
predict markedly different Monsoon-time cyclone trajectories over the Indian
subcontinent, raising questions about their readiness for operational
applications. Our analysis finds that ECMWF's deterministic AIFS model offers
the most reliable performance and usability, with GraphCast and GenCast being
close seconds.

Conclusion: MolErr2Fix为评估化学推理能力提供了专注的基准测试，旨在支持开发更可靠和化学信息丰富的语言模型。所有标注和评估API将公开发布以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown growing potential in molecular
sciences, but they often produce chemically inaccurate descriptions and
struggle to recognize or justify potential errors. This raises important
concerns about their robustness and reliability in scientific applications. To
support more rigorous evaluation of LLMs in chemical reasoning, we present the
MolErr2Fix benchmark, designed to assess LLMs on error detection and correction
in molecular descriptions. Unlike existing benchmarks focused on
molecule-to-text generation or property prediction, MolErr2Fix emphasizes
fine-grained chemical understanding. It tasks LLMs with identifying,
localizing, explaining, and revising potential structural and semantic errors
in molecular descriptions. Specifically, MolErr2Fix consists of 1,193
fine-grained annotated error instances. Each instance contains quadruple
annotations, i.e,. (error type, span location, the explanation, and the
correction). These tasks are intended to reflect the types of reasoning and
verification required in real-world chemical communication. Evaluations of
current state-of-the-art LLMs reveal notable performance gaps, underscoring the
need for more robust chemical reasoning capabilities. MolErr2Fix provides a
focused benchmark for evaluating such capabilities and aims to support progress
toward more reliable and chemically informed language models. All annotations
and an accompanying evaluation API will be publicly released to facilitate
future research.

Conclusion: NMR-Solver将计算NMR分析、深度学习和可解释化学推理统一为一个连贯系统，为分子科学中的逆问题解决建立了可推广的范式。

Abstract: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful and
widely used tools for molecular structure elucidation in organic chemistry.
However, the interpretation of NMR spectra to determine unknown molecular
structures remains a labor-intensive and expertise-dependent process,
particularly for complex or novel compounds. Although recent methods have been
proposed for molecular structure elucidation, they often underperform in
real-world applications due to inherent algorithmic limitations and limited
high-quality data. Here, we present NMR-Solver, a practical and interpretable
framework for the automated determination of small organic molecule structures
from $^1$H and $^{13}$C NMR spectra. Our method introduces an automated
framework for molecular structure elucidation, integrating large-scale spectral
matching with physics-guided fragment-based optimization that exploits
atomic-level structure-spectrum relationships in NMR. We evaluate NMR-Solver on
simulated benchmarks, curated experimental data from the literature, and
real-world experiments, demonstrating its strong generalization, robustness,
and practical utility in challenging, real-life scenarios. NMR-Solver unifies
computational NMR analysis, deep learning, and interpretable chemical reasoning
into a coherent system. By incorporating the physical principles of NMR into
molecular optimization, it enables scalable, automated, and chemically
meaningful molecular identification, establishing a generalizable paradigm for
solving inverse problems in molecular science.

Result: 所有模型都能捕捉平衡结构，但对非平衡过程的预测存在差异。任务特定微调相比从头训练和零样本模型显著提高了动力学准确性，但可能降低长程物理表征的质量。内部表征分析显示不同训练范式产生截然不同的潜在物理编码。

Conclusion: 该研究为机器学习力场开发提供了实用指南，强调了基于迁移的探针作为高效诊断工具的价值，并提出了面向不确定性感知主动学习策略的发展路径。

Abstract: Machine-learned force fields (MLFFs), particularly pre-trained foundation
models, promise to bring ab initio-level accuracy to the length and time scales
of molecular dynamics. Yet this shift raises a central question: is it better
to build a specialist model from scratch or adapt a generalist foundation model
for a specific system? The trade-offs in data efficiency, predictive accuracy,
and risks of out-of-distribution (OOD) failure remain unclear. Here, we present
a benchmarking framework that contrasts bespoke (from scratch) and fine-tuned
foundation models in a test case of a technologically relevant 2D material,
Cr-intercalated Sb2Te3, using the MACE architecture. Our framework employs
migration pathways, evaluated through nudged elastic band (NEB) trajectories,
as a diagnostic probe that tests both interpolation and extrapolation. We
assess accuracy for equilibrium, kinetic (atomic migration), and mechanical
(interlayer sliding) tasks. While all models capture equilibrium structures,
predictions for non-equilibrium processes diverge. Task-specific fine-tuning
substantially improves kinetic accuracy compared with both from-scratch and
zero-shot models, but can degrade learned representations of long-range
physics. Analysis of internal representations shows that training paradigms
yield distinct, non-overlapping latent encodings of system physics. This work
offers a practical guide for MLFF development, highlights migration-based
probes as efficient diagnostics, and suggests pathways toward uncertainty-aware
active learning strategies.

jointly model LHC jets with both modalities. Trained on CMS Open Data, our
model can generate high fidelity jets with realistic kinematics, jet

Conclusion: 证明了可以开发出延迟低、稳健的实时套弋灶等离子体形状控制模型

Abstract: Machine learning has recently been adopted to emulate sensitivity matrices
for real-time magnetic control of tokamak plasmas. However, these approaches
would benefit from a quantification of possible inaccuracies. We report on two
aspects of real-time applicability of emulators. First, we quantify the
agreement of target displacement from VCs computed via Jacobians of the shape
emulators with those from finite differences Jacobians on exact Grad-Shafranov
solutions. Good agreement ($\approx$5-10%) can be achieved on a selection of
geometric targets using combinations of neural network emulators with
$\approx10^5$ parameters. A sample of $\approx10^{5}-10^{6}$ synthetic
equilibria is essential to train emulators that are not over-regularised or
overfitting. Smaller models trained on the shape targets may be further
fine-tuned to better fit the Jacobians. Second, we address the effect of vessel
currents that are not directly measured in real-time and are typically subsumed
into effective "shaping currents" when designing virtual circuits. We
demonstrate that shaping currents can be inferred via simple linear regression
on a trailing window of active coil current measurements with residuals of only
a few Amp\`eres, enabling a choice for the most appropriate shaping currents at
any point in a shot. While these results are based on historic shot data and

Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is a state-of-the-art machine learning method that
makes use of the power of dynamical systems (the reservoir) for real-time
inference. When using biological complex systems as reservoir substrates, it
serves as a testbed for basic questions about bio-inspired computation -- of
how self-organization generates proper spatiotemporal patterning. Here, we use
a simulation of an active matter system, driven by a chaotically moving input
signal, as a reservoir. So far, it has been unclear whether such complex
systems possess the capacity to process information efficiently and
independently of the method by which it was introduced. We find that when
switching from a repulsive to an attractive driving force, the system
completely changes the way it computes, while the predictive performance
landscapes remain nearly identical. The nonlinearity of the driver's injection
force improves computation by decoupling the single-agent dynamics from that of
the driver. Triggered are the (re-)growth, deformation, and active motion of
smooth structural boundaries (interfaces), and the emergence of coherent
gradients in speed -- features found in many soft materials and biological
systems. The nonlinear driving force activates emergent regulatory mechanisms,
which manifest enhanced morphological and dynamic diversity -- arguably
improving fading memory, nonlinearity, expressivity, and thus, performance. We
further perform RC in a broad variety of non-equilibrium active matter phases
that arise when tuning internal (repulsive) forces for information transfer.
Overall, we find that active matter agents forming liquid droplets are
particularly well suited for RC. The consistently convex shape of the
predictive performance landscapes, together with the observed phenomenological
richness, conveys robustness and adaptivity.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出LightningCP和DFA两种创新方法，专门针对说话头部生成任务加速扩散模型推理，在保持视频质量的同时显著提升推理速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型加速方法未能充分利用说话头部生成任务特有的时空冗余特性，导致推理速度慢，限制了实际应用

Method: 1) Lightning-fast Caching-based Parallel denoising prediction (LightningCP)：缓存静态特征，在推理时跳过大部分模型层，并使用缓存特征和估计噪声潜在作为输入实现并行预测；2) Decoupled Foreground Attention (DFA)：利用说话头部视频的空间解耦特性，将注意力计算限制在动态前景区域；3) 在某些层中移除参考特征以获得额外加速

Result: 大量实验证明该框架在保持视频质量的同时显著提高了推理速度

Conclusion: 该任务特定框架通过利用说话头部生成任务的独特特性，有效解决了扩散模型推理速度慢的问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion-based talking head models generate high-quality, photorealistic
videos but suffer from slow inference, limiting practical applications.
Existing acceleration methods for general diffusion models fail to exploit the
temporal and spatial redundancies unique to talking head generation. In this
paper, we propose a task-specific framework addressing these inefficiencies
through two key innovations. First, we introduce Lightning-fast Caching-based
Parallel denoising prediction (LightningCP), caching static features to bypass
most model layers in inference time. We also enable parallel prediction using
cached features and estimated noisy latents as inputs, efficiently bypassing
sequential sampling. Second, we propose Decoupled Foreground Attention (DFA) to
further accelerate attention computations, exploiting the spatial decoupling in
talking head videos to restrict attention to dynamic foreground regions.
Additionally, we remove reference features in certain layers to bring extra
speedup. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves inference speed while preserving video quality.

TL;DR: LatentEdit是一个自适应潜在融合框架，通过动态结合当前潜在代码和源图像反演的参考潜在代码，在保持背景相似性的同时实现高质量图像编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散式图像编辑中保持背景相似性、速度效率和内存效率的挑战，提供既保持保真度又具有良好编辑性的解决方案。

Method: 采用自适应潜在融合框架，选择性保留高相似度语义重要区域的源特征，在目标提示引导下生成其他区域的目标内容，无需内部模型修改或复杂注意力机制。

Result: 在PIE-Bench数据集上实验表明，LatentEdit在保真度和编辑性之间达到最优平衡，在8-15步内超越最先进方法，其无反演变体进一步减少计算量。

Conclusion: LatentEdit提供了一个轻量级、即插即用的解决方案，兼容UNet和DiT架构，显著提升了实时部署效率。

Abstract: Diffusion-based Image Editing has achieved significant success in recent
years. However, it remains challenging to achieve high-quality image editing
while maintaining the background similarity without sacrificing speed or memory
efficiency. In this work, we introduce LatentEdit, an adaptive latent fusion
framework that dynamically combines the current latent code with a reference
latent code inverted from the source image. By selectively preserving source
features in high-similarity, semantically important regions while generating
target content in other regions guided by the target prompt, LatentEdit enables
fine-grained, controllable editing. Critically, the method requires no internal
model modifications or complex attention mechanisms, offering a lightweight,
plug-and-play solution compatible with both UNet-based and DiT-based
architectures. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench dataset demonstrate that
our proposed LatentEdit achieves an optimal balance between fidelity and
editability, outperforming the state-of-the-art method even in 8-15 steps.
Additionally, its inversion-free variant further halves the number of neural
function evaluations and eliminates the need for storing any intermediate
variables, substantially enhancing real-time deployment efficiency.

Method: 在3D扩散模型潜在空间中直接操作几何，通过混合生成和源对象的3D注意力图来指导编辑合成，结合几何感知正则化指导、傅里叶域频谱调制策略和3D增强细化步骤

Result: 方法在广泛形状和语义操作范围内实现了高保真度、精确和鲁棒的编辑效果，优于之前的3D编辑方法

Conclusion: 该方法通过直接在3D潜在空间操作，避免了2D先验蒸馏方法的多视图不一致问题，为3D资产编辑提供了新的有效途径

Abstract: Despite the recent success of multi-view diffusion models for
text/image-based 3D asset generation, instruction-based editing of 3D assets
lacks surprisingly far behind the quality of generation models. The main reason
is that recent approaches using 2D priors suffer from view-inconsistent editing
signals. Going beyond 2D prior distillation methods and multi-view editing
strategies, we propose a training-free editing method that operates within the
latent space of a native 3D diffusion model, allowing us to directly manipulate
3D geometry. We guide the edit synthesis by blending 3D attention maps from the
generation with the source object. Coupled with geometry-aware regularization
guidance, a spectral modulation strategy in the Fourier domain and a refinement
step for 3D enhancement, our method outperforms previous 3D editing methods
enabling high-fidelity, precise, and robust edits across a wide range of shapes
and semantic manipulations.

Abstract: Estimating albedo (a.k.a., intrinsic image decomposition) from single RGB
images captured in real-world environments (e.g., the MVImgNet dataset)
presents a significant challenge due to the absence of paired images and their
ground truth albedos. Therefore, while recent methods (e.g., IntrinsicAnything)
have achieved breakthroughs by harnessing powerful diffusion priors, they
remain predominantly trained on large-scale synthetic datasets (e.g.,
Objaverse) and applied directly to real-world RGB images, which ignores the
large domain gap between synthetic and real-world data and leads to suboptimal
generalization performance. In this work, we address this gap by proposing
IntrinsicReal, a novel domain adaptation framework that bridges the
above-mentioned domain gap for real-world intrinsic image decomposition.
Specifically, our IntrinsicReal adapts IntrinsicAnything to the real domain by
fine-tuning it using its high-quality output albedos selected by a novel dual
pseudo-labeling strategy: i) pseudo-labeling with an absolute confidence
threshold on classifier predictions, and ii) pseudo-labeling using the relative
preference ranking of classifier predictions for individual input objects. This
strategy is inspired by human evaluation, where identifying the highest-quality
outputs is straightforward, but absolute scores become less reliable for
sub-optimal cases. In these situations, relative comparisons of outputs become
more accurate. To implement this, we propose a novel two-phase pipeline that
sequentially applies these pseudo-labeling techniques to effectively adapt
IntrinsicAnything to the real domain. Experimental results show that our
IntrinsicReal significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving
state-of-the-art results for albedo estimation on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

Conclusion: RealMat通过结合合成数据训练和基于真实数据的强化学习优化，有效解决了材质生成中的真实感问题，为3D内容创作提供了更高质量的材质生成工具。

Abstract: Generative models for high-quality materials are particularly desirable to
make 3D content authoring more accessible. However, the majority of material
generation methods are trained on synthetic data. Synthetic data provides
precise supervision for material maps, which is convenient but also tends to
create a significant visual gap with real-world materials. Alternatively,
recent work used a small dataset of real flash photographs to guarantee
realism, however such data is limited in scale and diversity. To address these
limitations, we propose RealMat, a diffusion-based material generator that
leverages realistic priors, including a text-to-image model and a dataset of
realistic material photos under natural lighting. In RealMat, we first finetune
a pretrained Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) with synthetic material maps arranged
in $2 \times 2$ grids. This way, our model inherits some realism of SDXL while
learning the data distribution of the synthetic material grids. Still, this
creates a realism gap, with some generated materials appearing synthetic. We
propose to further finetune our model through reinforcement learning (RL),
encouraging the generation of realistic materials. We develop a realism reward
function for any material image under natural lighting, by collecting a
large-scale dataset of realistic material images. We show that this approach
increases generated materials' realism compared to our base model and related
work.

Result: 构建了计算高效的架构，在网格分割和分类任务中达到可比性能，无需昂贵的特征值分解或复杂预处理

Conclusion: 该方法通过直接学习框架成功避免了传统光谱方法的高计算成本，为网格分析提供了更高效的解决方案

Abstract: Currently, prominent Transformer architectures applied on graphs and meshes
for shape analysis tasks employ traditional attention layers that heavily
utilize spectral features requiring costly eigenvalue decomposition-based
methods. To encode the mesh structure, these methods derive positional
embeddings, that heavily rely on eigenvalue decomposition based operations,
e.g. on the Laplacian matrix, or on heat-kernel signatures, which are then
concatenated to the input features. This paper proposes a novel approach
inspired by the explicit construction of the Hodge Laplacian operator in
Discrete Exterior Calculus as a product of discrete Hodge operators and
exterior derivatives, i.e. $(L := \star_0^{-1} d_0^T \star_1 d_0)$. We adjust
the Transformer architecture in a novel deep learning layer that utilizes the
multi-head attention mechanism to approximate Hodge matrices $\star_0$,
$\star_1$ and $\star_2$ and learn families of discrete operators $L$ that act
on mesh vertices, edges and faces. Our approach results in a
computationally-efficient architecture that achieves comparable performance in
mesh segmentation and classification tasks, through a direct learning
framework, while eliminating the need for costly eigenvalue decomposition
operations or complex preprocessing operations.

Motivation: 传统PCA网格模型分辨率有限，神经体积方法渲染速度慢，现有高斯溅射面部模型依赖网格先验，无法捕捉精细几何和全头覆盖

Method: 在基础3DMM上添加残差几何和外观组件，使用粗解码器生成网格变形，细解码器表示高斯外观，轻量CNN细化渲染图像，并创建EXPRESS-50数据集进行训练

Result: 在单目3D人脸重建、新视角合成和表情迁移任务中，GRMM在保真度和表情准确性方面超越现有方法，同时保持75FPS实时渲染性能

Conclusion: GRMM成功解决了传统3DMM的局限性，实现了高细节捕捉、解耦控制和实时渲染，为面部建模和动画提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) enable controllable facial geometry and
expression editing for reconstruction, animation, and AR/VR, but traditional
PCA-based mesh models are limited in resolution, detail, and photorealism.
Neural volumetric methods improve realism but remain too slow for interactive
use. Recent Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based facial models achieve fast,
high-quality rendering but still depend solely on a mesh-based 3DMM prior for
expression control, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained geometry,
expressions, and full-head coverage. We introduce GRMM, the first full-head
Gaussian 3D morphable model that augments a base 3DMM with residual geometry
and appearance components, additive refinements that recover high-frequency
details such as wrinkles, fine skin texture, and hairline variations. GRMM
provides disentangled control through low-dimensional, interpretable parameters
(e.g., identity shape, facial expressions) while separately modelling residuals
that capture subject- and expression-specific detail beyond the base model's
capacity. Coarse decoders produce vertex-level mesh deformations, fine decoders
represent per-Gaussian appearance, and a lightweight CNN refines rasterised
images for enhanced realism, all while maintaining 75 FPS real-time rendering.
To learn consistent, high-fidelity residuals, we present EXPRESS-50, the first
dataset with 60 aligned expressions across 50 identities, enabling robust
disentanglement of identity and expression in Gaussian-based 3DMMs. Across
monocular 3D face reconstruction, novel-view synthesis, and expression
transfer, GRMM surpasses state-of-the-art methods in fidelity and expression
accuracy while delivering interactive real-time performance.

Abstract: Following rapid advancements in text and image generation, research has
increasingly shifted towards 3D generation. Unlike the well-established
pixel-based representation in images, 3D representations remain diverse and
fragmented, encompassing a wide variety of approaches such as voxel grids,
neural radiance fields, signed distance functions, point clouds, or octrees,
each offering distinct advantages and limitations. In this work, we present a
unified evaluation framework designed to assess the performance of 3D
representations in reconstruction and generation. We compare these
representations based on multiple criteria: quality, computational efficiency,
and generalization performance. Beyond standard model benchmarking, our
experiments aim to derive best practices over all steps involved in the 3D
generation pipeline, including preprocessing, mesh reconstruction, compression
with autoencoders, and generation. Our findings highlight that reconstruction
errors significantly impact overall performance, underscoring the need to
evaluate generation and reconstruction jointly. We provide insights that can
inform the selection of suitable 3D models for various applications,
facilitating the development of more robust and application-specific solutions
in 3D generation. The code for our framework is available at

Conclusion: 该方法通过引入运动字幕和运动强度预测框架，成功解决了唱歌驱动3D头部动画的挑战，为虚拟化身、娱乐和教育应用提供了高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Singing-driven 3D head animation is a challenging yet promising task with
applications in virtual avatars, entertainment, and education. Unlike speech,
singing involves richer emotional nuance, dynamic prosody, and lyric-based
semantics, requiring the synthesis of fine-grained, temporally coherent facial
motion. Existing speech-driven approaches often produce oversimplified,
emotionally flat, and semantically inconsistent results, which are insufficient
for singing animation. To address this, we propose Think2Sing, a
diffusion-based framework that leverages pretrained large language models to
generate semantically coherent and temporally consistent 3D head animations,
conditioned on both lyrics and acoustics. A key innovation is the introduction
of motion subtitles, an auxiliary semantic representation derived through a
novel Singing Chain-of-Thought reasoning process combined with acoustic-guided
retrieval. These subtitles contain precise timestamps and region-specific
motion descriptions, serving as interpretable motion priors. We frame the task
as a motion intensity prediction problem, enabling finer control over facial
regions and improving the modeling of expressive motion. To support this, we
create a multimodal singing dataset with synchronized video, acoustic
descriptors, and motion subtitles, enabling diverse and expressive motion
learning. Extensive experiments show that Think2Sing outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in realism, expressiveness, and emotional fidelity,
while also offering flexible, user-controllable animation editing.

work for small cardinality n and low corruption but degrade rapidly. Our
experiments, carried out on Mace4-generated data sets, demonstrate that our
hybrid framework achieves higher healing rates than deterministic-only and

95% of semigroups up to cardinality n=6 and 60% at n=10.

Abstract: Legal documents pose unique challenges for text classification due to their
domain-specific language and often limited labeled data. This paper proposes a
hybrid approach for classifying legal texts by combining unsupervised topic and
graph embeddings with a supervised model. We employ Top2Vec to learn semantic
document embeddings and automatically discover latent topics, and Node2Vec to
capture structural relationships via a bipartite graph of legal documents. The
embeddings are combined and clustered using KMeans, yielding coherent groupings
of documents. Our computations on a legal document dataset demonstrate that the
combined Top2Vec+Node2Vec approach improves clustering quality over text-only
or graph-only embeddings. We conduct a sensitivity analysis of hyperparameters,
such as the number of clusters and the dimensionality of the embeddings, and
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance against baseline
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
models. Key findings indicate that while the pipeline presents an innovative
approach to unsupervised legal document analysis by combining semantic topic
modeling with graph embedding techniques, its efficacy is contingent upon the
quality of initial topic generation and the representational power of the
chosen embedding models for specialized legal language. Strategic
recommendations include the exploration of domain-specific embeddings, more
comprehensive hyperparameter tuning for Node2Vec, dynamic determination of
cluster numbers, and robust human-in-the-loop validation processes to enhance
legal relevance and trustworthiness. The pipeline demonstrates potential for
exploratory legal data analysis and as a precursor to supervised learning tasks
but requires further refinement and domain-specific adaptation for practical
legal applications.

play a crucial role in DNA replication and genes expression. An improper
chromatin folding could lead to malfunctions and, over time, diseases. For
eukaryotes, centromeres are essential for proper chromosome segregation and
folding. Despite extensive research using de novo sequencing of genomes and
annotation analysis, centromere locations in yeasts remain difficult to infer
and are still unknown in most species. Recently, genome-wide chromosome
conformation capture coupled with next-generation sequencing (Hi-C) has become
one of the leading methods to investigate chromosome structures. Some recent
studies have used Hi-C data to give a point estimate of each centromere, but
those approaches highly rely on a good pre-localization. Here, we present a
novel approach that infers in a stochastic manner the locations of all
centromeres in budding yeast based on both the experimental Hi-C map and
simulated contact maps.

*Erwan Dereure,Emmanuel Akame Mfoumou,David Holcman*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出基于直径收缩比的概率方法，通过追踪极端点修剪后数据范围收缩来评估一维样本的尾部行为和几何稳定性，构建了比传统似然比检验更优的分类决策规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种稳健的方法来评估一维样本的尾部行为和分布特性，特别是在小样本或噪声环境下，传统方法如似然比检验效果有限。

Method: 开发直径收缩比指标量化极端点移除后的数据范围相对缩减，推导均匀分布和高斯分布下的理论收缩曲线，构建基于收缩曲线相似性的分类决策规则。

Result: 该方法在小样本或噪声环境下比经典似然比检验具有更高的分类准确率，同时保持大样本渐近一致性，并能有效集成到聚类流程中验证一维簇稳定性。

Conclusion: 提供了理论洞见和实用工具，用于稳健的分布推断和聚类稳定性分析，无需密度估计或参数调优。

Abstract: We develop a probabilistic method for assessing the tail behavior and
geometric stability of one-dimensional n i.i.d. samples by tracking how their
span contracts when the most extreme points are trimmed. Central to our
approach is the diameter-shrinkage ratio, that quantifies the relative
reduction in data range as extreme points are successively removed. We derive
analytical expressions, including finite-sample corrections, for the expected
shrinkage under both the uniform and Gaussian hypotheses, and establish that
these curves remain distinct even for moderate number of removal. We construct
an elementary decision rule that assigns a sample to whichever theoretical
shrinkage profile it most closely follows. This test achieves higher
classification accuracy than the classical likelihood-ratio test in
small-sample or noisy regimes, while preserving asymptotic consistency for
large n. We further integrate our criterion into a clustering pipeline (e.g.
DBSCAN), demonstrating its ability to validate one-dimensional clusters without
any density estimation or parameter tuning. This work thus provides both
theoretical insight and practical tools for robust distributional inference and
cluster stability analysis.

Motivation: BART在非参数建模和预测方面表现出色，单调BART能更精确地估计单调函数，但需要将其扩展到二元结果变量的场景

Method: 基于probit链接函数，将单调BART框架应用于二元分类问题，估计条件均值函数

Result: 开发了probit单调BART方法，能够处理二元结果变量的单调函数估计问题

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了单调BART的应用范围，使其能够处理二元分类问题中的单调约束估计

Abstract: Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) of Chipman et al. (2010) has proven
to be a powerful tool for nonparametric modeling and prediction. Monotone BART
(Chipman et al., 2022) is a recent development that allows BART to be more
precise in estimating monotonic functions. We further these developments by
proposing probit monotone BART, which allows the monotone BART framework to
estimate conditional mean functions when the outcome variable is binary.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文介绍了矩阵和张量的非递减（ND）秩概念，研究了其理论性质，并提出了寻找低ND秩近似的算法，应用于猪体重和COVID-19心理健康调查数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统张量分解方法缺乏对单调性约束的考虑，而许多实际数据集（如时间序列、有序分类数据）具有内在的单调性模式，需要开发能够保持这种结构约束的分解方法。

Method: 引入ND秩概念，定义为满足单调性约束的向量外积和的最小数量；建立ND秩理论框架；提出基于分层交替最小二乘法的变体算法来寻找低ND秩近似。

Result: 证明了在某些偏序集排序下，ND分解等价于变换后张量的非负秩分解；发展了ND秩的典型值、最大值和边界秩理论；成功应用于两个实际数据集的分析。

Conclusion: ND秩为具有单调性结构的数据提供了有意义的分解框架，算法能够有效发现数据中的单调模式，在有序数据分析中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: In this article the notion of the nondecreasing (ND) rank of a matrix or
tensor is introduced. A tensor has an ND rank of r if it can be represented as
a sum of r outer products of vectors, with each vector satisfying a
monotonicity constraint. It is shown that for certain poset orderings finding
an ND factorization of rank $r$ is equivalent to finding a nonnegative rank-r
factorization of a transformed tensor. However, not every tensor that is
monotonic has a finite ND rank. Theory is developed describing the properties
of the ND rank, including typical, maximum, and border ND ranks. Highlighted
also are the special settings where a matrix or tensor has an ND rank of one or
two. As a means of finding low ND rank approximations to a data tensor we
introduce a variant of the hierarchical alternating least squares algorithm.
Low ND rank factorizations are found and interpreted for two datasets
concerning the weight of pigs and a mental health survey during the COVID-19
pandemic.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在处理具有空间异质性和时间依赖性的未测量混杂因素时存在限制，需要开发能够同时处理复杂时空动态和多分辨率变量的因果推断框架

Method: 整合了基于扩散的采样机制和有效的后门调整集，采用区域特定的结构方程和条件自回归过程处理未测量混杂因素，通过基展开处理功能数据以适应异质分辨率变量

Result: 理论分析建立了反事实估计的误差界限，实证评估在合成数据集和真实空气污染数据上显示PFD-BDCM优于现有方法

Conclusion: PFD-BDCM框架成功解决了具有空间异质性和时间依赖性的未测量混杂因素的因果推断问题，为复杂时空环境下的因果分析提供了有效工具

Abstract: We introduce a Partial Functional Dynamic Backdoor Diffusion-based Causal
Model (PFD-BDCM), specifically designed for causal inference in the presence of
unmeasured confounders with spatial heterogeneity and temporal dependency. The
proposed PFD-BDCM framework addresses the restrictions of the existing
approaches by uniquely integrating models for complex spatio-temporal dynamics
with the analysis of multi-resolution variables. Specifically, the framework
systematically mitigates confounding bias by integrating valid backdoor
adjustment sets into a diffusion-based sampling mechanism. Moreover, it
accounts for the intricate dynamics of unmeasured confounders through the
deployment of region-specific structural equations and conditional
autoregressive processes, and accommodates variables observed at heterogeneous
resolutions via basis expansions for functional data. Our theoretical analysis
establishes error bounds for counterfactual estimates of PFD-BDCM, formally
linking reconstruction accuracy to counterfactual fidelity under monotonicity
assumptions of structural equation and invertibility assumptions of encoding
function. Empirical evaluations on synthetic datasets and real-world air
pollution data demonstrate PFD-BDCM's superiority over existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决两个连续变量间的因果方向判定问题，传统方法需要假设噪声分布或模型形式，需要更通用且可识别的方法

Method: 基于MDL原则构建因果得分，利用在紧实数区间上具有密度性质的函数类，具体实现使用三次回归样条(LCUBE)，只有一个超参数

Result: 在Tuebingen因果对数据集上获得最优的AUDRC精度，在10个基准数据集上表现优异，在13个数据集上达到平均以上精度

Conclusion: LCUBE是可识别、可解释、简单快速的方法，不假设噪声高斯性，只需噪声较小，在真实数据上表现出色

Abstract: We address the problem of determining the causal direction between two
univariate, continuous-valued variables, X and Y, under the assumption of no
hidden confounders. In general, it is not possible to make definitive
statements about causality without some assumptions on the underlying model. To
distinguish between cause and effect, we propose a bivariate causal score based
on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, using functions that possess
the density property on a compact real interval. We prove the identifiability
of these causal scores under specific conditions. These conditions can be
easily tested. Gaussianity of the noise in the causal model equations is not
assumed, only that the noise is low. The well-studied class of cubic splines
possesses the density property on a compact real interval. We propose LCUBE as
an instantiation of the MDL-based causal score utilizing cubic regression
splines. LCUBE is an identifiable method that is also interpretable, simple,
and very fast. It has only one hyperparameter. Empirical evaluations compared
to state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that LCUBE achieves superior precision
in terms of AUDRC on the real-world Tuebingen cause-effect pairs dataset. It
also shows superior average precision across common 10 benchmark datasets and
achieves above average precision on 13 datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的通用逼近定理(UATs)在理论真空中运行，假设无噪声数据且网络参数可自由选择，这与实际机器学习目标存在差距。本文旨在弥合这一差距。

Method: 引入架构特定的随机训练算法，从N个噪声训练样本中在d维立方体[0,1]^d上构建均匀逼近器，使用最小化最优的可训练参数数量。

Result: 训练后的神经网络达到了最小化最优的可训练参数数量(除对数因子外)，并表现出真实神经网络的三个关键行为：亚线性参数复杂性、精确插值训练数据、合理的Lipschitz正则性。

Conclusion: 该研究将最先进的UATs更接近实际机器学习，将核心开放问题从噪声样本下的算法可实现性转向随机梯度下降是否能达到类似保证。

Abstract: At its core, machine learning seeks to train models that reliably generalize
beyond noisy observations; however, the theoretical vacuum in which
state-of-the-art universal approximation theorems (UATs) operate isolates them
from this goal, as they assume noiseless data and allow network parameters to
be chosen freely, independent of algorithmic realism. This paper bridges that
gap by introducing an architecture-specific randomized training algorithm that
constructs a uniform approximator from $N$ noisy training samples on the
$d$-dimensional cube $[0,1]^d$. Our trained neural networks attain the
minimax-optimal quantity of \textit{trainable} (non-random) parameters, subject
to logarithmic factors which vanish under the idealized noiseless sampling
assumed in classical UATs.
  Additionally, our trained models replicate key behaviours of real-world
neural networks, absent in standard UAT constructions, by: (1) exhibiting
sub-linear parametric complexity when fine-tuning on structurally related and
favourable out-of-distribution tasks, (2) exactly interpolating the training
data, and (3) maintaining reasonable Lipschitz regularity (after the initial
clustering attention layer). These properties bring state-of-the-art UATs
closer to practical machine learning, shifting the central open question from
algorithmic implementability with noisy samples to whether stochastic gradient
descent can achieve comparable guarantees.

Motivation: 金融交易数据流的规模和复杂性不断增长，传统方法需要大量标签数据集，并在处理不规则采样频率和变化序列长度的时间序列时遇到困难。

Method: 扩展条件GAN进行目标数据增帽，集成贝叶斯推断获取预测分布和量化不确定性，利用log-signature进行交易历史的稳健特征编码，并引入新的Wasserstein距离损失函数。

Conclusion: 证明了GAN驱动的半监督学习结合log-signature在处理不规则采样时间序列时的有效性，并强调了不确定性意识预测的重要性。

Abstract: We present a novel deep generative semi-supervised framework for credit card
fraud detection, formulated as time series classification task. As financial
transaction data streams grow in scale and complexity, traditional methods
often require large labeled datasets, struggle with time series of irregular
sampling frequencies and varying sequence lengths. To address these challenges,
we extend conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for targeted data
augmentation, integrate Bayesian inference to obtain predictive distributions
and quantify uncertainty, and leverage log-signatures for robust feature
encoding of transaction histories. We introduce a novel Wasserstein
distance-based loss to align generated and real unlabeled samples while
simultaneously maximizing classification accuracy on labeled data. Our approach
is evaluated on the BankSim dataset, a widely used simulator for credit card
transaction data, under varying proportions of labeled samples, demonstrating
consistent improvements over benchmarks in both global statistical and
domain-specific metrics. These findings highlight the effectiveness of
GAN-driven semi-supervised learning with log-signatures for irregularly sampled
time series and emphasize the importance of uncertainty-aware predictions.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文研究了随机插值框架中插值时间表的设计，发现虽然所有标量插值时间表在最优扩散系数调优后在路径空间的KL散度下具有相同的统计效率，但数值效率差异显著。作者提出了基于Lipschitz常数最小化的数值优化准则，并在高斯分布和高维问题中验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的插值时间表设计主要关注统计效率，但忽略了数值效率的差异。作者发现不同时间表在数值计算效率上存在显著差异，这促使他们转向关注数值特性而非统计标准来设计更高效的时间表。

Method: 提出了平均平方Lipschitz最小化作为数值优化的原则性准则，替代最优传输方法中的动能最小化。推导了转换公式，可以在推理时在不同时间表之间转换而无需重新训练神经网络。

Result: 在高斯分布上，优化后的时间表相比标准线性时间表实现了Lipschitz常数的指数级改进；在高斯混合分布上，减少了少步采样中的模式崩溃问题；在高维随机Allen-Cahn方程和Navier-Stokes方程的稳态分布上也验证了性能提升。

Conclusion: 数值效率而非统计效率应该是插值时间表设计的主要考虑因素。提出的Lipschitz最小化准则提供了有效的数值优化方法，转换公式实现了时间表的灵活转换，该方法在各种分布类型和维度上都表现出稳健的性能改进。

Abstract: We study the design of interpolation schedules in the stochastic interpolants
framework for flow and diffusion-based generative models. We show that while
all scalar interpolation schedules achieve identical statistical efficiency
under Kullback-Leibler divergence in path space after optimal diffusion
coefficient tuning, their numerical efficiency can differ substantially. This
observation motivates focusing on numerical properties of the resulting drift
fields rather than statistical criteria for schedule design. We propose
averaged squared Lipschitzness minimization as a principled criterion for
numerical optimization, providing an alternative to kinetic energy minimization
used in optimal transport approaches. A transfer formula is derived that
enables conversion between different schedules at inference time without
retraining neural networks. For Gaussian distributions, our optimized schedules
achieve exponential improvements in Lipschitz constants over standard linear
schedules, while for Gaussian mixtures, they reduce mode collapse in few-step
sampling. We also validate our approach on high-dimensional invariant
distributions from stochastic Allen-Cahn equations and Navier-Stokes equations,
demonstrating robust performance improvements across resolutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决从Gibbs分布采样的问题，通过演化有限粒子来改进现有的无噪声采样方法，提高采样效率和稳定性

Method: 使用预条件技术，基于正则化Wasserstein近端算子的分数函数近似，通过Cole-Hopf变换耦合各向异性热方程，推导出核公式，扩散部分可解释为改进的自注意力机制

Result: 在二次势能情况下提供了离散时间非渐近收敛分析，偏差依赖于正则化而与步长无关。在log-concave和非log-concave示例、图像去卷积以及贝叶斯神经网络训练中表现出加速效果和粒子级稳定性

Conclusion: 该方法在多种采样任务中表现出竞争性或更好的性能，特别是在使用可变预条件矩阵时，为非凸贝叶斯神经网络训练提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: We consider sampling from a Gibbs distribution by evolving finitely many
particles. We propose a preconditioned version of a recently proposed
noise-free sampling method, governed by approximating the score function with
the numerically tractable score of a regularized Wasserstein proximal operator.
This is derived by a Cole--Hopf transformation on coupled anisotropic heat
equations, yielding a kernel formulation for the preconditioned regularized
Wasserstein proximal. The diffusion component of the proposed method is also
interpreted as a modified self-attention block, as in transformer
architectures. For quadratic potentials, we provide a discrete-time
non-asymptotic convergence analysis and explicitly characterize the bias, which
is dependent on regularization and independent of step-size. Experiments
demonstrate acceleration and particle-level stability on various log-concave
and non-log-concave toy examples to Bayesian total-variation regularized image
deconvolution, and competitive/better performance on non-convex Bayesian neural
network training when utilizing variable preconditioning matrices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然密集测量矩阵下的稀疏恢复已有广泛研究，但稀疏测量矩阵设置下的问题仍较少探索。本文旨在建立稀疏测量矩阵下成功稀疏恢复的充分条件，揭示采样复杂度与测量稀疏性之间的权衡关系。

Method: 通过理论分析建立稀疏恢复的充分条件，结合已知的必要条件，在特定参数条件下（ds/p→∞）发现相变现象。同时研究了从密集矩阵稀疏化对稀疏信号恢复的影响。

Result: 发现稀疏恢复在信息论阈值n_INF^SP = Θ(slog(p/s)/log(ds/p))处存在相变，量化了稀疏性代价：限制每个测量为d个非零元素会使所需样本量增加log(s)/log(ds/p)倍。在s=αp和d=ψp条件下，证明n_Sp-ified_INF = Θ(p/ψ²)样本量足够。

Conclusion: 稀疏测量矩阵下的稀疏恢复存在明确的信息论相变阈值，揭示了测量稀疏性与采样复杂度之间的精确权衡关系。稀疏化密集测量矩阵需要满足特定条件才能保证恢复性能。

Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering the support of a sparse signal using
noisy projections. While extensive work has been done on the dense measurement
matrix setting, the sparse setting remains less explored. In this work, we
establish sufficient conditions on the sample size for successful sparse
recovery using sparse measurement matrices. Bringing together our result with
previously known necessary conditions, we discover that, in the regime where
$ds/p \rightarrow +\infty$, sparse recovery in the sparse setting exhibits a
phase transition at an information-theoretic threshold of
$n_{\text{INF}}^{\text{SP}} =
\Theta\left(s\log\left(p/s\right)/\log\left(ds/p\right)\right)$, where $p$
denotes the signal dimension, $s$ the number of non-zero components of the
signal, and $d$ the expected number of non-zero components per row of
measurement. This expression makes the price of sparsity explicit: restricting
each measurement to $d$ non-zeros inflates the required sample size by a factor
of $\log{s}/\log\left(ds/p\right)$, revealing a precise trade-off between
sampling complexity and measurement sparsity. Additionally, we examine the
effect of sparsifying an originally dense measurement matrix on sparse signal
recovery. We prove in the regime of $s = \alpha p$ and $d = \psi p$ with
$\alpha, \psi \in \left(0,1\right)$ and $\psi$ small that a sample of size
$n^{\text{Sp-ified}}_{\text{INF}} = \Theta\left(p / \psi^2\right)$ is
sufficient for recovery, subject to a certain uniform integrability conjecture,
the proof of which is work in progress.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于循环结构使得仅靠观测数据无法恢复图骨架，而混杂因素会使传统条件独立性检验失效，因此需要设计干预实验来准确识别包含循环和双向边的因果图结构。

Method: 利用条件独立性检验和干预检验，结合d分离和σ分离理论，开发了有界和无界两类算法来恢复因果边。

Result: 提出的算法能够恢复除双向相邻边外的所有因果边，并且在推导的下界范围内（对数因子内）达到最优。

Conclusion: 该研究为在复杂因果图（含循环和混杂）中设计干预实验提供了理论保证和实用算法，解决了传统方法在循环和混杂场景下的局限性。

Abstract: We study the problem of experimental design for accurately identifying the
causal graph structure of a simple structural causal model (SCM), where the
underlying graph may include both cycles and bidirected edges induced by latent
confounders. The presence of cycles renders it impossible to recover the graph
skeleton using observational data alone, while confounding can further
invalidate traditional conditional independence (CI) tests in certain
scenarios. To address these challenges, we establish lower bounds on both the
maximum number of variables that can be intervened upon in a single experiment
and the total number of experiments required to identify all directed edges and
non-adjacent bidirected edges. Leveraging both CI tests and do see tests, and
accounting for $d$ separation and $\sigma$ separation, we develop two classes
of algorithms, i.e., bounded and unbounded, that can recover all causal edges
except for double adjacent bidirected edges. We further show that, up to
logarithmic factors, the proposed algorithms are tight with respect to the
derived lower bounds.

Motivation: 农业管理中的序列决策需要优化资源投入，但传统bandit和强化学习方法要么依赖线性模型可能错误表示领域知识，要么需要大量数据，而农业决策往往观测数据有限

Method: 提出非线性模型bandit算法家族，结合原则性不确定性量化和闭式利润最优解计算，将领域特定的响应曲线直接嵌入探索-利用循环

Conclusion: 该方法利用机制洞察而非大数据量，特别适合资源受限场景，支持可持续、包容和透明的序列决策，直接贡献于零饥饿和负责任消费生产的可持续发展目标

Abstract: Sequential decision-making is central to sustainable agricultural management
and precision agriculture, where resource inputs must be optimized under
uncertainty and over time. However, such decisions must often be made with
limited observations, whereas classical bandit and reinforcement learning
approaches typically rely on either linear or black-box reward models that may
misrepresent domain knowledge or require large amounts of data. We propose a
family of nonlinear, model-based bandit algorithms that embed domain-specific
response curves directly into the exploration-exploitation loop. By coupling
(i) principled uncertainty quantification with (ii) closed-form or rapidly
computable profit optima, these algorithms achieve sublinear regret and
near-optimal sample complexity while preserving interpretability. Theoretical
analysis establishes regret and sample complexity bounds, and extensive
simulations emulating real-world fertilizer-rate decisions show consistent
improvements over both linear and nonparametric baselines (such as linear UCB
and $k$-NN UCB) in the low-sample regime, under both well-specified and
shape-compatible misspecified models. Because our approach leverages
mechanistic insight rather than large data volumes, it is especially suited to
resource-constrained settings, supporting sustainable, inclusive, and
transparent sequential decision-making across agriculture, environmental
management, and allied applications. This methodology directly contributes to
SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) by
enabling data-driven, less wasteful agricultural practices.

TL;DR: 该论文研究图上的随机过程，通过神经网络先验信息增强初始状态和传播轨迹的恢复，提出了BP-AMP混合算法来处理传播动态和节点协变量信息。


<details>

Motivation: 传统方法假设初始状态在节点间独立同分布，但现实中节点协变量会影响初始状态。本文考虑初始状态是节点协变量未知函数的情况，使用神经网络建模这一关系。

Method: 采用单层感知器作为初始状态的神经网络模型，在贝叶斯框架下推导了混合置信传播和近似消息传递(BP-AMP)算法，同时处理传播动态和协变量信息。

Result: 在某些机制下，当使用Rademacher分布作为神经网络权重时，模型会出现一阶相变，导致统计-计算差距，即使理论上可能完美恢复，BP-AMP算法也无法实现。

Conclusion: 神经网络先验信息能显著提升初始状态和传播轨迹的恢复性能，但算法性能受到相变现象的限制，存在统计与计算之间的差距。

Abstract: Stochastic processes on graphs are a powerful tool for modelling complex
dynamical systems such as epidemics. A recent line of work focused on the
inference problem where one aims to estimate the state of every node at every
time, starting from partial observation of a subset of nodes at a subset of
times. In these works, the initial state of the process was assumed to be
random i.i.d. over nodes. Such an assumption may not be realistic in practice,
where one may have access to a set of covariate variables for every node that
influence the initial state of the system. In this work, we will assume that
the initial state of a node is an unknown function of such covariate variables.
Given that functions can be represented by neural networks, we will study a
model where the initial state is given by a simple neural network -- notably
the single-layer perceptron acting on the known node-wise covariate variables.
  Within a Bayesian framework, we study how such neural-network prior
information enhances the recovery of initial states and spreading trajectories.
We derive a hybrid belief propagation and approximate message passing (BP-AMP)
algorithm that handles both the spreading dynamics and the information included
in the node covariates, and we assess its performance against the estimators
that either use only the spreading information or use only the information from
the covariate variables.
  We show that in some regimes, the model can exhibit first-order phase
transitions when using a Rademacher distribution for the neural-network
weights. These transitions create a statistical-to-computational gap where even
the BP-AMP algorithm, despite the theoretical possibility of perfect recovery,
fails to achieve it.

Abstract: Actuarial ratemaking depends on high-quality data, yet access to such data is
often limited by the cost of obtaining new data, privacy concerns, etc. In this
paper, we explore synthetic-data generation as a potential solution to these
issues. In addition to discussing generative methods previously studied in the
actuarial literature, we introduce to the insurance community another approach
based on Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE). We present a
comparative study using an open-source dataset and evaluating MICE-based models
against other generative models like Variational Autoencoders and Conditional
Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks. We assess how well synthetic data
preserves the original marginal distributions of variables as well as the
multivariate relationships among covariates. We also investigate the
consistency between Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) trained on synthetic data
with GLMs trained on the original data. Furthermore, we assess the ease of use
of each generative approach and study the impact of augmenting original data
with synthetic data on the performance of GLMs for predicting claim counts. Our
results highlight the potential of MICE-based methods in creating high-quality
tabular data while being more user-friendly than the other methods.

Conclusion: 该框架为上下文学习提供了有效的不确定性分解方法，有助于提高大语言模型预测的可靠性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) gain popularity in conducting prediction
tasks in-context, understanding the sources of uncertainty in in-context
learning becomes essential to ensuring reliability. The recent hypothesis of
in-context learning performing predictive Bayesian inference opens the avenue
for Bayesian uncertainty estimation, particularly for decomposing uncertainty
into epistemic uncertainty due to lack of in-context data and aleatoric
uncertainty inherent in the in-context prediction task. However, the
decomposition idea remains under-explored due to the intractability of the
latent parameter posterior from the underlying Bayesian model. In this work, we
introduce a variational uncertainty decomposition framework for in-context
learning without explicitly sampling from the latent parameter posterior, by
optimising auxiliary queries as probes to obtain an upper bound to the
aleatoric uncertainty of an LLM's in-context learning procedure, which also
induces a lower bound to the epistemic uncertainty. Through experiments on
synthetic and real-world tasks, we show quantitatively and qualitatively that
the decomposed uncertainties obtained from our method exhibit desirable
properties of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文改进了Flow Matching方法在无界分布上的理论收敛率，特别是在高维设置下，无需log-凹性假设


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow Matching作为一种有前景的生成建模方法，虽然经验上成功，但其统计能力的数学理解还很有限，主要因为理论界对驱动ODE的向量场Lipschitz常数的敏感性

Method: 研究控制这种依赖性的假设，基于这些结果推导Wasserstein 1距离的收敛率

Result: 在高维设置下改进了先前结果，适用于某些无界分布类别，特别不需要log-凹性

Conclusion: 为Flow Matching方法提供了更好的理论保证，特别是在处理无界分布和高维数据时

Abstract: Flow Matching, a promising approach in generative modeling, has recently
gained popularity. Relying on ordinary differential equations, it offers a
simple and flexible alternative to diffusion models, which are currently the
state-of-the-art. Despite its empirical success, the mathematical understanding
of its statistical power so far is very limited. This is largely due to the
sensitivity of theoretical bounds to the Lipschitz constant of the vector field
which drives the ODE. In this work, we study the assumptions that lead to
controlling this dependency. Based on these results, we derive a convergence
rate for the Wasserstein $1$ distance between the estimated distribution and
the target distribution which improves previous results in high dimensional
setting. This rate applies to certain classes of unbounded distributions and
particularly does not require $\log$-concavity.

*Haichen Hu,David Simchi-Levi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出使用wild refitting方法在Bregman损失下评估惩罚经验风险最小化的超额风险，无需依赖函数类的全局结构，适用于复杂模型如深度神经网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习理论和经验过程技术难以处理现代复杂ML/AI模型（如深度神经网络和大语言模型）的超额风险评估问题，需要一种模型无关的方法。

Method: 利用wild refitting程序，通过随机向量值对称化和适当缩放预测残差，构建人工修改的结果来重新训练第二个预测器进行超额风险评估。

Result: 在固定设计和随机设计设置下建立了高概率性能保证，证明wild refitting在适当选择wild噪声尺度时能有效上界超额风险。

Conclusion: 该方法为理论评估现代不透明ML/AI模型的性能提供了有前景的途径，特别是在模型类别过于复杂而无法应用传统分析技术的情况下。

Abstract: We study the problem of evaluating the excess risk of classical penalized
empirical risk minimization (ERM) with Bregman losses. We show that by
leveraging the recently proposed wild refitting procedure (Wainwright, 2025),
one can efficiently upper bound the excess risk through the so-called "wild
optimism," without relying on the global structure of the underlying function
class. This property makes our approach inherently model-free. Unlike
conventional analyses, our framework operates with just one dataset and
black-box access to the training procedure. The method involves randomized
vector-valued symmetrization with an appropriate scaling of the prediction
residues and constructing artificially modified outcomes, upon which we retrain
a second predictor for excess risk estimation. We establish high-probability
performance guarantees both under the fixed design setting and the random
design setting, demonstrating that wild refitting under Bregman losses, with an
appropriately chosen wild noise scale, yields a valid upper bound on the excess
risk. This work thus is promising for theoretically evaluating modern opaque ML
and AI models such as deep neural networks and large language models, where the
model class is too complex for classical learning theory and empirical process
techniques to apply.

Abstract: Quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) promises compact function approximators
with access to vast Hilbert spaces, but its practical progress is slowed by
NISQ-era constraints such as limited qubits and noise accumulation. We
introduce a multi-chip ensemble framework using multiple small Quantum
Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) to overcome these constraints. Our
approach partitions complex, high-dimensional observations from the Super Mario
Bros environment across independent quantum circuits, then classically
aggregates their outputs within a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) framework. This
modular architecture enables QRL in complex environments previously
inaccessible to quantum agents, achieving superior performance and learning
stability compared to classical baselines and single-chip quantum models. The
multi-chip ensemble demonstrates enhanced scalability by reducing information
loss from dimensionality reduction while remaining implementable on near-term
quantum hardware, providing a practical pathway for applying QRL to real-world
problems.

Abstract: Distinguishing correlation from causation is a fundamental challenge in
machine intelligence, often representing a critical barrier to building robust
and trustworthy systems. While Pearl's $\mathcal{DO}$-calculus provides a
rigorous framework for causal inference, a parallel challenge lies in its
physical implementation. Here, we apply and experimentally validate a quantum
algorithmic framework for performing causal interventions. Our approach maps
causal networks onto quantum circuits where probabilistic links are encoded by
controlled-rotation gates, and interventions are realized by a structural
remodeling of the circuit -- a physical analogue to Pearl's ``graph surgery''.
We demonstrate the method's efficacy by resolving Simpson's Paradox in a
3-qubit model, and show its scalability by quantifying confounding bias in a
10-qubit healthcare simulation. Critically, we provide a proof-of-principle
experimental validation on an IonQ Aria quantum computer, successfully
reproducing the paradox and its resolution in the presence of real-world noise.
This work establishes a practical pathway for quantum causal inference,
offering a new computational tool to address deep-rooted challenges in
algorithmic fairness and explainable AI (XAI).

Abstract: Intrusion detection in unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) swarms is complicated by
high mobility, non-stationary traffic, and severe class imbalance. Leveraging a
120 k-flow simulation corpus that covers five attack types, we benchmark three
quantum-machine-learning (QML) approaches - quantum kernels, variational
quantum neural networks (QNNs), and hybrid quantum-trained neural networks
(QT-NNs) - against strong classical baselines. All models consume an 8-feature
flow representation and are evaluated under identical preprocessing, balancing,
and noise-model assumptions. We analyse the influence of encoding strategy,
circuit depth, qubit count, and shot noise, reporting accuracy, macro-F1,
ROC-AUC, Matthews correlation, and quantum-resource footprints. Results reveal
clear trade-offs: quantum kernels and QT-NNs excel in low-data, nonlinear
regimes, while deeper QNNs suffer from trainability issues, and CNNs dominate
when abundant data offset their larger parameter count. The complete codebase
and dataset partitions are publicly released to enable reproducible QML
research in network security.

Abstract: Weather forecasting plays a crucial role in supporting strategic decisions
across various sectors, including agriculture, renewable energy production, and
disaster management. However, the inherently dynamic and chaotic behavior of
the atmosphere presents significant challenges to conventional predictive
models. On the other hand, introducing quantum computing simulation techniques
to the forecasting problems constitutes a promising alternative to overcome
these challenges. In this context, this work explores the emerging intersection
between quantum machine learning (QML) and climate forecasting. We present the
implementation of a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) trained on real meteorological
data from NASA's Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER) database. The
results show that QNN has the potential to outperform a classical Recurrent
Neural Network (RNN) in terms of accuracy and adaptability to abrupt data
shifts, particularly in wind speed prediction. Despite observed nonlinearities
and architectural sensitivities, the QNN demonstrated robustness in handling
temporal variability and faster convergence in temperature prediction. These
findings highlight the potential of quantum models in short and medium term
climate prediction, while also revealing key challenges and future directions
for optimization and broader applicability.

Conclusion: 量子逆灰机可作为VQA训练的可扩展替代方案，尤其适用于平原效应和噪声梯度场景，为近期量子计算开启混合量子门-量子逆灰-经典优化模型的新可能性

Abstract: Quantum annealers provide an effective framework for solving large-scale
combinatorial optimization problems. This work presents a novel methodology for
training Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) by reformulating the parameter
optimization task as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)
problem. Unlike traditional gradient-based methods, our approach directly
leverages the Hamiltonian of the chosen VQA ansatz and employs an adaptive,
metaheuristic optimization scheme. This optimization strategy provides a rich
set of configurable parameters which enables the adaptation to specific problem
characteristics and available computational resources. The proposed framework
is generalizable to arbitrary Hamiltonians and integrates a recursive
refinement strategy to progressively approximate high-quality solutions.
  Experimental evaluations demonstrate the feasibility of the method and its
ability to significantly reduce computational overhead compared to classical
and evolutionary optimizers, while achieving comparable or superior solution
quality. These findings suggest that quantum annealers can serve as a scalable
alternative to classical optimizers for VQA training, particularly in scenarios
affected by barren plateaus and noisy gradient estimates, and open new
possibilities for hybrid quantum gate - quantum annealing - classical
optimization models in near-term quantum computing.

Motivation: 椭圆型偏微分方程求解是科学和工程研究中的基础问题，传统Walk-on-Spheres方法虽然有效但存在计算效率限制，需要开发更高效的全局求解方法。

Method: 将神经网络与Walk-on-Spheres方法和空间离散化方法集成，开发WoS-NN随机求解器，处理Dirichlet边界条件的椭圆问题，实现精确快速的全局解和梯度近似。

Conclusion: WoS-NN方法继承了WoS方法的无网格和对不规则区域鲁棒性等优点，通过神经网络集成实现了训练后的即时局部预测，特别适用于静态区域的密集计算需求。

Abstract: Solving elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) is a fundamental step
in various scientific and engineering studies. As a classic stochastic solver,
the Walk-on-Spheres (WoS) method is a well-established and efficient algorithm
that provides accurate local estimates for PDEs. In this paper, by integrating
machine learning techniques with WoS and space discretization approaches, we
develop a novel stochastic solver, WoS-NN. This new method solves elliptic
problems with Dirichlet boundary conditions, facilitating precise and rapid
global solutions and gradient approximations. The method inherits excellent
characteristics from the original WoS method, such as being meshless and robust
to irregular regions. By integrating neural networks, WoS-NN also gives instant
local predictions after training without re-sampling, which is especially
suitable for intense requests on a static region. A typical experimental result
demonstrates that the proposed WoS-NN method provides accurate field
estimations, reducing errors by around $75\%$ while using only $8\%$ of path
samples compared to the conventional WoS method, which saves abundant
computational time and resource consumption.

Abstract: In a context where the social sciences and humanities are experimenting with
non-anthropocentric analytical frames, this article proposes a semiotic
(structural) reading of the hybridization between symbolic AI and neural (or

knowledge base for area studies. We describe the LaCAS ecosystem -- Open
Archives in Linguistic and Cultural Studies (thesaurus; RDF/OWL ontology; LOD
services; harvesting; expertise; publication), deployed at Inalco (National
Institute for Oriental Languages and Civilizations) in Paris with the Okapi
(Open Knowledge and Annotation Interface) software environment from Ina
(National Audiovisual Institute), which now has around 160,000 documentary
resources and ten knowledge macro-domains grouping together several thousand
knowledge objects. We illustrate this approach using the knowledge domain
''Languages of the world'' (~540 languages) and the knowledge object ''Quechua
(language)''. On this basis, we discuss the controlled integration of neural
tools, more specifically generative tools, into the life cycle of a knowledge
base: assistance with data localization/qualification, index extraction and
aggregation, property suggestion and testing, dynamic file generation, and
engineering of contextualized prompts (generic, contextual, explanatory,
adjustment, procedural) aligned with a domain ontology. We outline an ecosystem
of specialized agents capable of animating the database while respecting its
symbolic constraints, by articulating model-driven and data-driven methods.

Motivation: 传统邮件安全系统默认信任内部邮件，导致组织容易受到员工账户被黑后的内部攻击，需要轻量级的实时防御手段。

Method: 基于Enron语料库构建数据集，使用朴素贝叶斯和字符级卷积神经网络(Char-CNN)两种分类器进行作者身份验证。

Result: Char-CNN模型在各种情况下都取得了高准确率和F1分数，表现优于朴素贝叶斯模型。

Conclusion: 基于发送者写作风格的个人作者分类器实用性强，可以低开销地集成到现有商业邮件安全系统中。

Abstract: Business email compromise and lateral spear phishing attacks are among modern
organizations' most costly and damaging threats. While inbound phishing
defenses have improved significantly, most organizations still trust internal
emails by default, leaving themselves vulnerable to attacks from compromised
employee accounts. In this work, we define and explore the problem of
authorship validation: verifying whether a claimed sender actually authored a
given email. Authorship validation is a lightweight, real-time defense that
complements traditional detection methods by modeling per-sender writing style.
Further, the paper presents a collection of new datasets based on the Enron
corpus. These simulate inauthentic messages using both human-written and large
language model-generated emails. The paper also evaluates two classifiers -- a
Naive Bayes model and a character-level convolutional neural network (Char-CNN)
-- for the authorship validation task. Our experiments show that the Char-CNN
model achieves high accuracy and F1 scores under various circumstances.
Finally, we discuss deployment considerations and show that per-sender
authorship classifiers are practical for integrating into existing commercial
email security systems with low overhead.

malicious events reliably and transparently, particularly in cases involving
unstructured or ambiguous log entries. In this work, we propose a novel
methodology that combines ontology-driven structured outputs with Large
Language Models (LLMs), to build an Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent that
improves the accuracy and explainability of information extraction from
cybersecurity logs. Central to our approach is the integration of domain
ontologies and SHACL-based constraints to guide the language model's output
structure and enforce semantic validity over the resulting graph. Extracted
information is organized into an ontology-enriched graph database, enabling
future semantic analysis and querying. The design of our methodology is
motivated by the analytical requirements associated with honeypot log data,
which typically comprises predominantly malicious activity. While our case
study illustrates the relevance of this scenario, the experimental evaluation
is conducted using publicly available datasets. Results demonstrate that our
method achieves higher accuracy in information extraction compared to
traditional prompt-only approaches, with a deliberate focus on extraction
quality rather than processing speed.

Abstract: The growing societal reliance on artificial intelligence necessitates robust
frameworks for ensuring its security, accountability, and trustworthiness. This
thesis addresses the complex interplay between privacy, verifiability, and
auditability in modern AI, particularly in foundation models. It argues that
technical solutions that integrate these elements are critical for responsible
AI innovation. Drawing from international policy contributions and technical
research to identify key risks in the AI pipeline, this work introduces novel
technical solutions for critical privacy and verifiability challenges.
Specifically, the research introduces techniques for enabling verifiable and
auditable claims about AI systems using zero-knowledge cryptography; utilizing
secure multi-party computation and trusted execution environments for
auditable, confidential deployment of large language models and information
retrieval; and implementing enhanced delegation mechanisms, credentialing
systems, and access controls to secure interactions with autonomous and
multi-agent AI systems. Synthesizing these technical advancements, this
dissertation presents a cohesive perspective on balancing privacy,
verifiability, and auditability in foundation model-based AI systems, offering
practical blueprints for system designers and informing policy discussions on
AI safety and governance.

Motivation: 解决提示注入攻击对LLM安全部署的威胁，现有基于提示的检测方法需要手动工程，效果受限

Method: 采用协同进化框架，攻击和防御提示通过基于梯度的自然语言优化技术相互迭代优化，使用文本梯度优化模块和LLM引导的评估循环

Result: 攻击成功率(ASR)达到1.0，比基线提升0.26；检测真阳性率(TPR)达到0.84，提升0.23；真阴性率(TNR)保持在0.89

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks pose a significant challenge to the safe deployment
of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications. While prompt-based
detection offers a lightweight and interpretable defense strategy, its
effectiveness has been hindered by the need for manual prompt engineering. To
address this issue, we propose AEGIS , an Automated co-Evolutionary framework
for Guarding prompt Injections Schema. Both attack and defense prompts are
iteratively optimized against each other using a gradient-like natural language
prompt optimization technique. This framework enables both attackers and
defenders to autonomously evolve via a Textual Gradient Optimization (TGO)
module, leveraging feedback from an LLM-guided evaluation loop. We evaluate our
system on a real-world assignment grading dataset of prompt injection attacks
and demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines,
achieving superior robustness in both attack success and detection.
Specifically, the attack success rate (ASR) reaches 1.0, representing an
improvement of 0.26 over the baseline. For detection, the true positive rate
(TPR) improves by 0.23 compared to the previous best work, reaching 0.84, and
the true negative rate (TNR) remains comparable at 0.89. Ablation studies
confirm the importance of co-evolution, gradient buffering, and multi-objective
optimization. We also confirm that this framework is effective in different
LLMs. Our results highlight the promise of adversarial training as a scalable
and effective approach for guarding prompt injections.

Motivation: 随着AI网页浏览代理的普及，其独特的数字指纹（浏览器属性、自动化框架特征等）形成了一个可识别的新流量类别，攻击者可以利用这种可识别性进行针对性攻击。

Method: 攻击方法包括：1）识别AI代理的数字指纹；2）动态提供伪装版本的网页内容；3）在视觉相同的页面中嵌入隐藏的恶意指令（如间接提示注入）。

Result: 该方法允许攻击者劫持代理行为，导致数据泄露、恶意软件执行或错误信息传播，同时对人类用户和传统安全爬虫完全不可见。

Conclusion: 这项工作形式化了威胁模型，详细说明了代理指纹识别和伪装机制，强调了为AI代理未来安全开发强大防御措施的紧迫性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel attack vector that leverages website cloaking
techniques to compromise autonomous web-browsing agents powered by Large
Language Models (LLMs). As these agents become more prevalent, their unique and
often homogenous digital fingerprints - comprising browser attributes,
automation framework signatures, and network characteristics - create a new,
distinguishable class of web traffic. The attack exploits this
fingerprintability. A malicious website can identify an incoming request as
originating from an AI agent and dynamically serve a different, "cloaked"
version of its content. While human users see a benign webpage, the agent is
presented with a visually identical page embedded with hidden, malicious
instructions, such as indirect prompt injections. This mechanism allows
adversaries to hijack agent behavior, leading to data exfiltration, malware
execution, or misinformation propagation, all while remaining completely
invisible to human users and conventional security crawlers. This work
formalizes the threat model, details the mechanics of agent fingerprinting and
cloaking, and discusses the profound security implications for the future of
agentic AI, highlighting the urgent need for robust defenses against this
stealthy and scalable attack.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级恶意软件检测框架，通过概率级融合三个不同数据集（静态特征、行为特征、内存模式）的预测结果，显著提升了跨域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单一数据集模型在跨域泛化方面表现不佳且计算成本高，需要开发能够整合多数据源并保持高效率的恶意软件检测方法。

Method: 使用LightGBM分类器分别训练三个数据集（EMBER、API调用序列、CIC混淆内存），通过特征选择确保效率，并采用网格搜索优化的权重进行概率级融合。

Result: 在跨域验证集上获得了0.823的宏F1分数，显著优于单个模型，同时保持了较低的计算开销。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了优异的泛化性能和实时部署能力，所有代码和数据都已公开以确保可重现性。

Abstract: The escalating sophistication of malware necessitates robust detection
mechanisms that generalize across diverse data sources. Traditional
single-dataset models struggle with cross-domain generalization and often incur
high computational costs. This paper presents a novel, lightweight framework
for malware detection that employs probability-level fusion across three
distinct datasets: EMBER (static features), API Call Sequences (behavioral
features), and CIC Obfuscated Memory (memory patterns). Our method trains
individual LightGBM classifiers on each dataset, selects top predictive
features to ensure efficiency, and fuses their prediction probabilities using
optimized weights determined via grid search. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our fusion approach achieves a macro F1-score of 0.823 on a cross-domain
validation set, significantly outperforming individual models and providing
superior generalization. The framework maintains low computational overhead,
making it suitable for real-time deployment, and all code and data are provided
for full reproducibility.

TL;DR: 该论文研究如何在保护患者隐私的前提下，通过节点级差分隐私计算跨多个医疗管辖区的Kaplan-Meier生存曲线。每个站点仅披露一次添加拉普拉斯噪声的曲线，服务器平均噪声曲线，保持总体隐私预算不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗数据通常分布在多个管辖区域，需要在不泄露患者隐私的情况下进行生存分析。传统方法需要迭代训练或复杂加密，本方法旨在实现一次性披露且保持临床实用性。

Method: 使用节点级差分隐私，每个站点在公共时间网格上添加拉普拉斯噪声后披露生存曲线。比较了四种一次性平滑技术：离散余弦变换、Haar小波收缩、自适应全变差去噪和参数化Weibull拟合。

Result: 在NCCTG肺癌队列的测试中，全变差去噪方法获得最佳平均精度，频域平滑方法提供更强的鲁棒性，Weibull模型在最严格隐私设置下表现最稳定。当隐私预算≥0.5时，所有方法都能保持经验log-rank I类错误低于15%。

Conclusion: 研究表明无需迭代训练或复杂加密即可共享具有临床实用性的生存信息，为跨管辖区的隐私保护生存分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We investigate how to calculate Kaplan-Meier survival curves across multiple
health-care jurisdictions while protecting patient privacy with node-level
differential privacy. Each site discloses its curve only once, adding Laplace
noise whose scale is determined by the length of the common time grid; the
server then averages the noisy curves, so the overall privacy budget remains
unchanged. We benchmark four one-shot smoothing techniques: Discrete Cosine
Transform, Haar Wavelet shrinkage, adaptive Total-Variation denoising, and a
parametric Weibull fit on the NCCTG lung-cancer cohort under five privacy
levels and three partition scenarios (uniform, moderately skewed, highly
imbalanced). Total-Variation gives the best mean accuracy, whereas the
frequency-domain smoothers offer stronger worst-case robustness and the Weibull
model shows the most stable behaviour at the strictest privacy setting. Across
all methods the released curves keep the empirical log-rank type-I error below
fifteen percent for privacy budgets of 0.5 and higher, demonstrating that
clinically useful survival information can be shared without iterative training
or heavy cryptography.

TL;DR: 本文评估了14种最先进的句子转换器，用于从攻击文本描述中自动识别漏洞，发现multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1模型在攻击技术描述分类中表现最佳，F1分数达89.0。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 安全领域中漏洞在被利用后仍常未被发现，手动将攻击映射到CVE漏洞不可行，需要自动化解决方案来及时响应安全事件。

Method: 评估14种state-of-the-art句子转换器模型，使用攻击文本描述自动识别和映射到CVE漏洞，重点关注multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1模型的表现。

Result: MMPNet模型在攻击技术描述分类中取得最佳性能：F1分数89.0、精确率84.0、召回率94.7。56%的识别漏洞在CVE库中有攻击关联，61%与CVE目录匹配，还发现了275个MITRE库中未记录的新链接。

Conclusion: 自动化链接攻击技术与漏洞不仅能增强安全事件检测和响应能力，还能缩短漏洞可利用时间，有助于构建更安全的系统。

Abstract: In the domain of security, vulnerabilities frequently remain undetected even
after their exploitation. In this work, vulnerabilities refer to publicly
disclosed flaws documented in Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
reports. Establishing a connection between attacks and vulnerabilities is
essential for enabling timely incident response, as it provides defenders with
immediate, actionable insights. However, manually mapping attacks to CVEs is
infeasible, thereby motivating the need for automation. This paper evaluates 14
state-of-the-art (SOTA) sentence transformers for automatically identifying
vulnerabilities from textual descriptions of attacks. Our results demonstrate
that the multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1 (MMPNet) model achieves superior
classification performance when using attack Technique descriptions, with an
F1-score of 89.0, precision of 84.0, and recall of 94.7. Furthermore, it was
observed that, on average, 56% of the vulnerabilities identified by the MMPNet
model are also represented within the CVE repository in conjunction with an
attack, while 61% of the vulnerabilities detected by the model correspond to
those cataloged in the CVE repository. A manual inspection of the results
revealed the existence of 275 predicted links that were not documented in the
MITRE repositories. Consequently, the automation of linking attack techniques
to vulnerabilities not only enhances the detection and response capabilities
related to software security incidents but also diminishes the duration during
which vulnerabilities remain exploitable, thereby contributing to the
development of more secure systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习面临拜占庭攻击威胁，现有数据驱动防御方法难以区分恶意更新和良性数据变化，导致高误报率和性能不佳。

Method: 采用代码插桩跟踪控制流和监控关键变量，在可信执行环境中使用可信训练记录器生成加密认证报告，服务器验证后只聚合可信模型更新。

Result: 在IoT设备上的实验表明，Sentinel能以低运行时和内存开销确保本地训练完整性的可信度。

Conclusion: Sentinel从系统安全角度重新获得客户端透明度，有效缓解拜占庭攻击，为联邦学习提供了可靠的安全保障方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has gained significant attention for its
privacy-preserving capabilities, enabling distributed devices to
collaboratively train a global model without sharing raw data. However, its
distributed nature forces the central server to blindly trust the local
training process and aggregate uncertain model updates, making it susceptible
to Byzantine attacks from malicious participants, especially in
mission-critical scenarios. Detecting such attacks is challenging due to the
diverse knowledge across clients, where variations in model updates may stem
from benign factors, such as non-IID data, rather than adversarial behavior.
Existing data-driven defenses struggle to distinguish malicious updates from
natural variations, leading to high false positive rates and poor filtering
performance.
  To address this challenge, we propose Sentinel, a remote attestation
(RA)-based scheme for FL systems that regains client-side transparency and
mitigates Byzantine attacks from a system security perspective. Our system
employs code instrumentation to track control-flow and monitor critical
variables in the local training process. Additionally, we utilize a trusted
training recorder within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to generate an
attestation report, which is cryptographically signed and securely transmitted
to the server. Upon verification, the server ensures that legitimate client
training processes remain free from program behavior violation or data
manipulation, allowing only trusted model updates to be aggregated into the
global model. Experimental results on IoT devices demonstrate that Sentinel
ensures the trustworthiness of the local training integrity with low runtime
and memory overhead.

TL;DR: LLM-HyPZ是一个基于大语言模型的混合框架，用于从漏洞语料库中进行零样本知识提取和精炼，实现了硬件漏洞的系统化、规模化分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬件漏洞相比软件漏洞更难修复，现有方法依赖专家调查缺乏统计严谨性，需要数据驱动的硬件弱点分析框架。

Method: 整合零样本LLM分类、上下文嵌入、无监督聚类和提示驱动的摘要技术，从CVE语料库中大规模挖掘硬件相关漏洞。

Result: 在114,836个CVE条目中识别出1,742个硬件相关漏洞，提炼出5个重复主题，LLaMA 3.3 70B达到99.5%的分类准确率。

Conclusion: LLM-HyPZ是首个数据驱动的可扩展方法，系统发现硬件漏洞，弥合专家知识与实际漏洞证据之间的差距。

Abstract: The rapid growth of hardware vulnerabilities has created an urgent need for
systematic and scalable analysis methods. Unlike software flaws, which are
often patchable post-deployment, hardware weaknesses remain embedded across
product lifecycles, posing persistent risks to processors, embedded devices,
and IoT platforms. Existing efforts such as the MITRE CWE Hardware List (2021)
relied on expert-driven Delphi surveys, which lack statistical rigor and
introduce subjective bias, while large-scale data-driven foundations for
hardware weaknesses have been largely absent. In this work, we propose
LLM-HyPZ, an LLM-assisted hybrid framework for zero-shot knowledge extraction
and refinement from vulnerability corpora. Our approach integrates zero-shot
LLM classification, contextualized embeddings, unsupervised clustering, and
prompt-driven summarization to mine hardware-related CVEs at scale. Applying
LLM-HyPZ to the 2021-2024 CVE corpus (114,836 entries), we identified 1,742
hardware-related vulnerabilities. We distilled them into five recurring themes,
including privilege escalation via firmware and BIOS, memory corruption in
mobile and IoT systems, and physical access exploits. Benchmarking across seven
LLMs shows that LLaMA 3.3 70B achieves near-perfect classification accuracy
(99.5%) on a curated validation set. Beyond methodological contributions, our
framework directly supported the MITRE CWE Most Important Hardware Weaknesses
(MIHW) 2025 update by narrowing the candidate search space. Specifically, our
pipeline surfaced 411 of the 1,026 CVEs used for downstream MIHW analysis,
thereby reducing expert workload and accelerating evidence gathering. These
results establish LLM-HyPZ as the first data-driven, scalable approach for
systematically discovering hardware vulnerabilities, thereby bridging the gap
between expert knowledge and real-world vulnerability evidence.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过API logit泄漏来克隆黑盒大语言模型的两阶段攻击方法，能够在有限查询和计算资源下快速生成功能相当的替代模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在关键任务系统中的部署增加，API缺乏健壮访问控制时暴露的logit信息可能成为被忽视的攻击面，现有研究主要关注输出层重构或表面行为蒸馏，但在严格查询约束下重建黑盒模型的研究不足。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先通过奇异值分解(SVD)从不到1万次黑盒查询中收集top-k logits来重构输出投影矩阵，然后将剩余架构蒸馏成不同深度的紧凑学生模型，使用开源数据集进行训练。

Result: 6层学生模型重现了97.6%的教师模型隐藏状态几何结构，困惑度仅增加7.31%，NLL为7.58；4层变体实现了17.1%的推理加速和18.1%的参数减少，整个攻击在24 GPU小时内完成且不会触发API速率限制防御。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明成本有限的攻击者可以快速克隆LLM，强调了加固推理API和安全本地部署的紧迫需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in mission-critical
systems, facilitating tasks such as satellite operations, command-and-control,
military decision support, and cyber defense. Many of these systems are
accessed through application programming interfaces (APIs). When such APIs lack
robust access controls, they can expose full or top-k logits, creating a
significant and often overlooked attack surface. Prior art has mainly focused
on reconstructing the output projection layer or distilling surface-level
behaviors. However, regenerating a black-box model under tight query
constraints remains underexplored. We address that gap by introducing a
constrained replication pipeline that transforms partial logit leakage into a
functional deployable substitute model clone. Our two-stage approach (i)
reconstructs the output projection matrix by collecting top-k logits from under
10k black-box queries via singular value decomposition (SVD) over the logits,
then (ii) distills the remaining architecture into compact student models with
varying transformer depths, trained on an open source dataset. A 6-layer
student recreates 97.6% of the 6-layer teacher model's hidden-state geometry,
with only a 7.31% perplexity increase, and a 7.58 Negative Log-Likelihood
(NLL). A 4-layer variant achieves 17.1% faster inference and 18.1% parameter
reduction with comparable performance. The entire attack completes in under 24
graphics processing unit (GPU) hours and avoids triggering API rate-limit
defenses. These results demonstrate how quickly a cost-limited adversary can
clone an LLM, underscoring the urgent need for hardened inference APIs and
secure on-premise defense deployments.

Motivation: 随着基于LLM的多智能体系统应用激增，Web链接安全性成为确保系统可靠性的关键问题。恶意网站访问可能导致攻击面大幅扩展，需要研究针对MAS的新型攻击方式。

Method: 设计了11种代表性攻击变体，包括域名篡改（同形异义字欺骗、字符替换等）、链接结构伪装（子目录嵌套、子域名嫁接、参数混淆等）以及其他针对MAS链接验证漏洞的欺骗技术。

Result: 实验证明Web欺诈攻击在不同MAS架构中表现出显著的破坏潜力，并且在规避方面具有独特优势：无需复杂的输入格式如越狱，降低了暴露风险。

Conclusion: Web欺诈攻击的隐蔽性和破坏性对系统安全和用户安全构成了不可忽视的威胁，强调了在LLM驱动的MAS中解决此类攻击的重要性。

Abstract: With the proliferation of applications built upon LLM-driven multi-agent
systems (MAS), the security of Web links has become a critical concern in
ensuring system reliability. Once an agent is induced to visit a malicious
website, attackers can use it as a springboard to conduct diverse subsequent
attacks, which will drastically expand the attack surface. In this paper, we
propose Web Fraud Attacks, a novel type of attack aiming at inducing MAS to
visit malicious websites. We design 11 representative attack variants that
encompass domain name tampering (homoglyph deception, character substitution,
etc.), link structure camouflage (sub-directory nesting, sub-domain grafting,
parameter obfuscation, etc.), and other deceptive techniques tailored to
exploit MAS's vulnerabilities in link validation. Through extensive experiments
on these crafted attack vectors, we demonstrate that Web fraud attacks not only
exhibit significant destructive potential across different MAS architectures
but also possess a distinct advantage in evasion: they circumvent the need for
complex input formats such as jailbreaking, which inherently carry higher
exposure risks. These results underscore the importance of addressing Web fraud
attacks in LLM-driven MAS, as their stealthiness and destructiveness pose
non-negligible threats to system security and user safety.

Abstract: Nowadays, the volume of network traffic continues to grow, along with the
frequency and sophistication of attacks. This scenario highlights the need for
solutions capable of continuously adapting, since network behavior is dynamic
and changes over time. This work presents an anomaly detection model for
network flows using unsupervised machine learning with online learning
capabilities. This approach allows the system to dynamically learn the normal
behavior of the network and detect deviations without requiring labeled data,
which is particularly useful in real-world environments where traffic is
constantly changing and labeled data is scarce. The model was implemented using
the River library with a One-Class SVM and evaluated on the NF-UNSW-NB15
dataset and its extended version v2, which contain network flows labeled with
different attack categories. The results show an accuracy above 98%, a false
positive rate below 3.1%, and a recall of 100% in the most advanced version of
the dataset. In addition, the low processing time per flow (<0.033 ms)
demonstrates the feasibility of the approach for real-time applications.

Abstract: Radiation Detection Systems (RDSs) play a vital role in ensuring public
safety across various settings, from nuclear facilities to medical
environments. However, these systems are increasingly vulnerable to
cyber-attacks such as data injection, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, ICMP
floods, botnet attacks, privilege escalation, and distributed denial-of-service
(DDoS) attacks. Such threats could compromise the integrity and reliability of
radiation measurements, posing significant public health and safety risks. This
paper presents a new synthetic radiation dataset and an Intrusion Detection
System (IDS) tailored for resource-constrained environments, bringing Machine
Learning (ML) predictive capabilities closer to the sensing edge layer of
critical infrastructure. Leveraging TinyML techniques, the proposed IDS employs
an optimized XGBoost model enhanced with pruning, quantization, feature
selection, and sampling. These TinyML techniques significantly reduce the size
of the model and computational demands, enabling real-time intrusion detection

Abstract: Radiation Detection Systems (RDSs) are used to measure and detect abnormal
levels of radioactive material in the environment. These systems are used in
many applications to mitigate threats posed by high levels of radioactive
material. However, these systems lack protection against malicious external
attacks to modify the data. The novelty of applying Intrusion Detection Systems
(IDS) in RDSs is a crucial element in safeguarding these critical
infrastructures. While IDSs are widely used in networking environments to
safeguard against various attacks, their application in RDSs is novel. A common
attack on RDSs is Denial of Service (DoS), where the attacker aims to overwhelm
the system, causing malfunctioning RDSs. This paper proposes an efficient
Machine Learning (ML)-based IDS to detect anomalies in radiation data, focusing
on DoS attacks. This work explores the use of sampling methods to create a
simulated DoS attack based on a real radiation dataset, followed by an
evaluation of various ML algorithms, including Random Forest, Support Vector
Machine (SVM), logistic regression, and Light Gradient-Boosting Machine
(LightGBM), to detect DoS attacks on RDSs. LightGBM is emphasized for its
superior accuracy and low computational resource consumption, making it
particularly suitable for real-time intrusion detection. Additionally, model
optimization and TinyML techniques, including feature selection, parallel
execution, and random search methods, are used to improve the efficiency of the
proposed IDS. Finally, an optimized and efficient LightGBM-based IDS is
developed to achieve accurate intrusion detection for RDSs.

TL;DR: Safhire是一个混合推理框架，通过在服务器上加密执行线性层，在客户端明文处理非线性激活，消除FHE中的昂贵自举操作，支持精确激活并显著减少计算量，同时通过随机洗牌保护模型机密性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在云服务中保护用户敏感数据和服务器模型机密性至关重要。全同态加密(FHE)虽然能在加密输入上直接推理，但受到昂贵自举操作和非线性激活低效近似的限制，需要更实用的解决方案。

Method: 提出Safhire混合推理框架：服务器加密执行线性层，客户端明文处理非线性激活；采用随机洗牌混淆中间值保护模型机密性；集成快速密文打包和部分提取等优化技术降低延迟。

Result: 在多个标准模型和数据集上的评估显示，Safhire比最先进的基线Orion实现1.5-10.5倍的推理延迟降低，通信开销可控，精度相当。

Conclusion: Safhire通过混合FHE推理方法，在保护数据隐私和模型机密性的同时，显著提升了推理效率，证明了混合FHE推理的实用性。

Abstract: In contemporary cloud-based services, protecting users' sensitive data and
ensuring the confidentiality of the server's model are critical. Fully
homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables inference directly on encrypted inputs,
but its practicality is hindered by expensive bootstrapping and inefficient
approximations of non-linear activations. We introduce Safhire, a hybrid
inference framework that executes linear layers under encryption on the server
while offloading non-linearities to the client in plaintext. This design
eliminates bootstrapping, supports exact activations, and significantly reduces
computation. To safeguard model confidentiality despite client access to
intermediate outputs, Safhire applies randomized shuffling, which obfuscates
intermediate values and makes it practically impossible to reconstruct the
model. To further reduce latency, Safhire incorporates advanced optimizations
such as fast ciphertext packing and partial extraction. Evaluations on multiple
standard models and datasets show that Safhire achieves 1.5X - 10.5X lower
inference latency than Orion, a state-of-the-art baseline, with manageable
communication overhead and comparable accuracy, thereby establishing the
practicality of hybrid FHE inference.

TL;DR: 这篇论文对比较邮件检测预阵方法进行了批判性评估，发现现有数据集存在语言偏差和时代性问题。研究者重新实现和测试多种机器学习方法，并提出了基于LLM的E-PhishGEN框架来生成更具挑战性的比较邮件数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现有比较邮件检测方法在定制数据集上表现几乎完美，但实际问题仍未解决。论文动机在批判性评估现有研究的局限性，特别是数据集代表性不足和语言偏差问题。

Method: 1) 分析现有比较数据集的局限性 2) 重新实现和测试多种ML检测方法 3) 提出E-PhishGEN框架使用LLM生成新的比较邮件数据集 4) 创建多语言数据集E-PhishLLM 5) 进行用户研究验证数据质量

Result: 在现有数据集上检测方法表现近乎完美，但在新创建的E-PhishLLM数据集上性能显著下降，证明现有方法存在过拟合问题。E-PhishLLM包含3种语言的16616封邮件，通过用户研究验证了数据质量。

Conclusion: 比较邮件检测仍是一个开放性问题，现有方法在真实场景下表现并不理想。论文提供了E-PhishGEN框架和E-PhishLLM数据集，为未来研究提供了更具挑战性的测试基准。

Abstract: Every day, our inboxes are flooded with unsolicited emails, ranging between
annoying spam to more subtle phishing scams. Unfortunately, despite abundant
prior efforts proposing solutions achieving near-perfect accuracy, the reality
is that countering malicious emails still remains an unsolved dilemma.
  This "open problem" paper carries out a critical assessment of scientific
works in the context of phishing email detection. First, we focus on the
benchmark datasets that have been used to assess the methods proposed in
research. We find that most prior work relied on datasets containing emails
that -- we argue -- are not representative of current trends, and mostly
encompass the English language. Based on this finding, we then re-implement and
re-assess a variety of detection methods reliant on machine learning (ML),
including large-language models (LLM), and release all of our codebase -- an
(unfortunately) uncommon practice in related research. We show that most such
methods achieve near-perfect performance when trained and tested on the same
dataset -- a result which intrinsically hinders development (how can future
research outperform methods that are already near perfect?). To foster the
creation of "more challenging benchmarks" that reflect current phishing trends,
we propose E-PhishGEN, an LLM-based (and privacy-savvy) framework to generate
novel phishing-email datasets. We use our E-PhishGEN to create E-PhishLLM, a
novel phishing-email detection dataset containing 16616 emails in three
languages. We use E-PhishLLM to test the detectors we considered, showing a
much lower performance than that achieved on existing benchmarks -- indicating
a larger room for improvement. We also validate the quality of E-PhishLLM with
a user study (n=30). To sum up, we show that phishing email detection is still
an open problem -- and provide the means to tackle such a problem by future
research.

TL;DR: 论文发现主流LLMs存在系统性安全漏洞，能够从良性提示中生成包含恶意URL的代码，平均4.2%的生成程序包含有害链接，证明训练数据已被大规模投毒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在训练过程中吸收互联网恶意内容的安全风险，因为LLMs在现代软件开发中的关键作用使其安全漏洞可能造成严重后果。

Method: 开发可扩展的自动化审计框架，从已知诈骗数据库合成无害的开发者风格提示，查询生产级LLMs并检测生成的代码是否包含有害URL。

Result: 在四个生产级LLMs（GPT-4o、GPT-4o-mini、Llama-4-Scout、DeepSeek-V3）的大规模评估中发现所有模型都以不可忽视的比率生成恶意代码，平均4.2%的程序包含恶意URL。

Conclusion: LLMs训练数据已被成功大规模投毒，迫切需要更强大的防御机制和后生成安全检查来缓解隐藏安全威胁的传播。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become critical to modern software
development, but their reliance on internet datasets for training introduces a
significant security risk: the absorption and reproduction of malicious
content. To evaluate this threat, this paper introduces a scalable, automated
audit framework that synthesizes innocuous, developer-style prompts from known
scam databases to query production LLMs and determine if they generate code
containing harmful URLs. We conducted a large-scale evaluation across four
production LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama-4-Scout, and DeepSeek-V3), and
found a systemic vulnerability, with all tested models generating malicious
code at a non-negligible rate. On average, 4.2\% of programs generated in our
experiments contained malicious URLs. Crucially, this malicious code is often
generated in response to benign prompts. We manually validate the prompts which
cause all four LLMs to generate malicious code, and resulting in 177 innocuous
prompts that trigger all models to produce harmful outputs. These results
provide strong empirical evidence that the training data of production LLMs has
been successfully poisoned at scale, underscoring the urgent need for more
robust defense mechanisms and post-generation safety checks to mitigate the
propagation of hidden security threats.

Motivation: FPGA在可重构系统中的广泛使用带来了安全风险，恶意比特流可能导致拒绝服务、数据泄露或隐蔽攻击，需要有效的检测方法。

Method: 采用监督机器学习方法，通过字节频率分析对比特流进行向量化，使用TSVD压缩和SMOTE平衡类别不平衡，在Xilinx PYNQ-Z1开发板上评估多种分类器。

Result: 随机森林分类器取得了0.97的宏F1分数，证明了在资源受限系统上实时特洛伊木马检测的可行性，最终模型通过PYNQ成功部署。

Conclusion: 该方法能够直接在二进制级别分析比特流，实现实时恶意检测，为FPGA系统安全提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The growing use of FPGAs in reconfigurable systems introducessecurity risks
through malicious bitstreams that could cause denial-of-service (DoS), data
leakage, or covert attacks. We investigated chip-level hardware malicious
payload in embedded systems and proposed a supervised machine learning method
to detect malicious bitstreams via static byte-level features. Our approach
diverges from existing methods by analyzing bitstreams directly at the binary
level, enabling real-time detection without requiring access to source code or
netlists. Bitstreams were sourced from state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks and
re-engineered to target the Xilinx PYNQ-Z1 FPGA Development Board. Our dataset
included 122 samples of benign and malicious configurations. The data were
vectorized using byte frequency analysis, compressed using TSVD, and balanced
using SMOTE to address class imbalance. The evaluated classifiers demonstrated
that Random Forest achieved a macro F1-score of 0.97, underscoring the
viability of real-time Trojan detection on resource-constrained systems. The
final model was serialized and successfully deployed via PYNQ to enable
integrated bitstream analysis.

Abstract: Mobile Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing diverse fields such
as healthcare, finance, and education with their ability to perform advanced
natural language processing tasks on-the-go. However, the deployment of these
models in mobile and edge environments introduces significant challenges
related to privacy and security due to their resource-intensive nature and the
sensitivity of the data they process. This survey provides a comprehensive
overview of privacy and security issues associated with mobile LLMs,
systematically categorizing existing solutions such as differential privacy,
federated learning, and prompt encryption. Furthermore, we analyze
vulnerabilities unique to mobile LLMs, including adversarial attacks,
membership inference, and side-channel attacks, offering an in-depth comparison
of their effectiveness and limitations. Despite recent advancements, mobile
LLMs face unique hurdles in achieving robust security while maintaining
efficiency in resource-constrained environments. To bridge this gap, we propose
potential applications, discuss open challenges, and suggest future research
directions, paving the way for the development of trustworthy,
privacy-compliant, and scalable mobile LLM systems.

Abstract: The field of embodied AI (EAI) is rapidly advancing. Unlike virtual AI, EAI
can exist in, learn from, reason about, and act in the physical world. Given
recent innovations in large language and multimodal models, along with
increasingly advanced and responsive hardware, EAI systems are rapidly growing
in capabilities and operational domains. These advances present significant
risks, including physical harm from malicious use, mass surveillance, and
economic and societal disruption. However, these risks have been severely
overlooked by policymakers. Existing policies, such as international standards
for industrial robots or statutes governing autonomous vehicles, are
insufficient to address the full range of concerns. While lawmakers are
increasingly focused on AI, there is now an urgent need to extend and adapt
existing frameworks to account for the unique risks of EAI. To help bridge this
gap, this paper makes three contributions: first, we provide a foundational
taxonomy of key physical, informational, economic, and social EAI risks.
Secondly, we analyze policies in the US, EU, and UK to identify how existing
frameworks address these risks and where these policies leave critical gaps. We
conclude by offering concrete policy recommendations to address the coming wave
of EAI innovation, including mandatory testing and certification for EAI
systems, clarified liability frameworks, and forward-looking strategies to
manage and prepare for transformative economic and societal impacts.

Motivation: 随着法律语料库和司法判决的快速增长，需要可扩展的法律AI系统来处理超长上下文。传统Transformer模型面临二次方注意力成本限制，影响效率和可扩展性。

Method: 在LexGLUE、EUR-Lex和ILDC等开源法律语料库上评估Mamba状态空间模型与领先Transformer模型，涵盖法规标注、司法结果预测和案例检索任务，使用准确率、召回率、MRR、nDCG等指标以及吞吐量和最大上下文长度。

Result: Mamba的线性扩展能力使其能处理比Transformer长数倍的法律文档，同时在检索和分类性能上保持或超越Transformer表现。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了状态空间模型与Transformer之间的权衡，为在法规分析、司法决策支持和政策研究中部署可扩展法律AI提供了指导，并发布了新的法律NLP长上下文建模基准套件。

Abstract: The rapid growth of statutory corpora and judicial decisions requires
scalable legal AI systems capable of classification and retrieval over
extremely long contexts. Transformer-based architectures (e.g., Longformer,
DeBERTa) dominate current legal NLP benchmarks but struggle with quadratic
attention costs, limiting efficiency and scalability. In this work, we present
the first comprehensive benchmarking of Mamba, a state-space model (SSM) with
linear-time selective mechanisms, against leading transformer models for
statutory classification and case law retrieval. We evaluate models on
open-source legal corpora including LexGLUE, EUR-Lex, and ILDC, covering
statutory tagging, judicial outcome prediction, and case retrieval tasks.
Metrics include accuracy, recall at k, mean reciprocal rank (MRR), and
normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG), alongside throughput measured in
tokens per second and maximum context length. Results show that Mamba's linear
scaling enables processing of legal documents several times longer than
transformers, while maintaining or surpassing retrieval and classification
performance. This study introduces a new legal NLP benchmark suite for
long-context modeling, along with open-source code and datasets to support
reproducibility. Our findings highlight trade-offs between state-space models
and transformers, providing guidance for deploying scalable legal AI in
statutory analysis, judicial decision support, and policy research.

Motivation: 生成式AI工具在教育中快速普及，但其在培养批判性思维方面的作用尚未充分探索。现有研究多关注GAI作为特定课程辅导工具或作业完成工具，而很少关注学生如何批判性评估GAI生成内容的准确性和适当性。

Method: 在计算与数据科学入门课程中设计学习活动，要求学生分析、批评和修订AI生成的解决方案，研究学生应用结构化批判性思维评估生成式AI输出的能力。

Abstract: Generative AI (GAI) tools have seen rapid adoption in educational settings,
yet their role in fostering critical thinking remains underexplored. While
previous studies have examined GAI as a tutor for specific lessons or as a tool
for completing assignments, few have addressed how students critically evaluate
the accuracy and appropriateness of GAI-generated responses. This pilot study
investigates students' ability to apply structured critical thinking when
assessing Generative AI outputs in introductory Computational and Data Science
courses. Given that GAI tools often produce contextually flawed or factually
incorrect answers, we designed learning activities that require students to
analyze, critique, and revise AI-generated solutions. Our findings offer
initial insights into students' ability to engage critically with GAI content
and lay the groundwork for more comprehensive studies in future semesters.

Abstract: As organizations face increasing pressure to understand their corporate and
products' carbon footprints, artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted calculation
systems for footprinting are proliferating, but with widely varying levels of
rigor and transparency. Standards and guidance have not kept pace with the
technology; evaluation datasets are nascent; and statistical approaches to
uncertainty analysis are not yet practical to apply to scaled systems. We
present a set of criteria to validate AI-assisted systems that calculate
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for products and materials. We implement a
three-step approach: (1) Identification of needs and constraints, (2) Draft
criteria development and (3) Refinements through pilots. The process identifies
three use cases of AI applications: Case 1 focuses on AI-assisted mapping to
existing datasets for corporate GHG accounting and product hotspotting,
automating repetitive manual tasks while maintaining mapping quality. Case 2
addresses AI systems that generate complete product models for corporate
decision-making, which require comprehensive validation of both component tasks
and end-to-end performance. We discuss the outlook for Case 3 applications,
systems that generate standards-compliant models. We find that credible AI
systems can be built and that they should be validated using system-level
evaluations rather than line-item review, with metrics such as benchmark
performance, indications of data quality and uncertainty, and transparent
documentation. This approach may be used as a foundation for practitioners,
auditors, and standards bodies to evaluate AI-assisted environmental assessment
tools. By establishing evaluation criteria that balance scalability with
credibility requirements, our approach contributes to the field's efforts to
develop appropriate standards for AI-assisted carbon footprinting systems.

mainly focus on performance and accuracy, are insufficient to address these
multifaceted issues. Thus, this study emphasizes the need for new
human_centered criteria that also reflect social impact. To this end, it
identifies key dimensions for evaluating the ethics and trustworthiness of
generative AI_fairness, transparency, accountability, safety, privacy,
accuracy, consistency, robustness, explainability, copyright and intellectual
property protection, and source traceability and develops detailed indicators
and assessment methodologies for each. Moreover, it provides a comparative
analysis of AI ethics policies and guidelines in South Korea, the United
States, the European Union, and China, deriving key approaches and implications
from each. The proposed framework applies across the AI lifecycle and
integrates technical assessments with multidisciplinary perspectives, thereby
offering practical means to identify and manage ethical risks in real_world
contexts. Ultimately, the study establishes an academic foundation for the
responsible advancement of generative AI and delivers actionable insights for
policymakers, developers, users, and other stakeholders, supporting the
positive societal contributions of AI technologies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在各领域的广泛应用，确保其符合伦理、法律和技术标准的需求日益迫切。可审计性作为独立评估AI系统合规性的能力，需要通过监管框架和标准化实践来实现。

Method: 通过分析新兴监管框架（如欧盟AI法案）的要求，探讨文档化、风险评估和治理结构等可审计性要素，并识别技术不透明、缺乏标准化工具等实施挑战。

Result: 识别了AI可审计性面临的多重挑战，包括技术复杂性、文档实践不一致、审计工具和指标标准化不足，以及现有负责任AI框架中的原则冲突。

Conclusion: 可审计性必须嵌入AI开发实践和治理基础设施中，需要多利益相关方合作、审计师赋权，以及清晰指南和国际协调，以确保AI系统不仅功能完善，而且在伦理和法律上保持一致。

Abstract: Auditability is defined as the capacity of AI systems to be independently
assessed for compliance with ethical, legal, and technical standards throughout
their lifecycle. The chapter explores how auditability is being formalized
through emerging regulatory frameworks, such as the EU AI Act, which mandate
documentation, risk assessments, and governance structures. It analyzes the
diverse challenges facing AI auditability, including technical opacity,
inconsistent documentation practices, lack of standardized audit tools and
metrics, and conflicting principles within existing responsible AI frameworks.
The discussion highlights the need for clear guidelines, harmonized
international regulations, and robust socio-technical methodologies to
operationalize auditability at scale. The chapter concludes by emphasizing the
importance of multi-stakeholder collaboration and auditor empowerment in
building an effective AI audit ecosystem. It argues that auditability must be
embedded in AI development practices and governance infrastructures to ensure
that AI systems are not only functional but also ethically and legally aligned.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 四次工业革命引发的数字化转型加剧了技能空缺，特别是对年长工人的影响。STEM技能需求日益增长，需要大规模的再技能和技能升级培训来满足工作力发展需求

Method: 提出了一种适应性教学框架，结合生成式AI和检索增强生成（RAG）技术，利用文档命中率和平均倒数排名优化学习内容，并在网络安全学习领域进行实验验证

Result: GPT-4在评估中表现最佳，达到87%的相关性和100%的内容对齐度。双模式方法使得适应性教学系统能够同时作为个性化主题推荐和内容生成器

Conclusion: 该框架为第四次工业革命教育和能力培养提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，能够实现快速、个性化的学习体验，有效应对当前工作力发展的挑战

Abstract: The rapid digital transformation of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR)
systems is reshaping workforce needs, widening skill gaps, especially for older
workers. With growing emphasis on STEM skills such as robotics, automation,
artificial intelligence (AI), and security, large-scale re-skilling and
up-skilling are required. Training programs must address diverse backgrounds,
learning styles, and motivations to improve persistence and success, while
ensuring rapid, cost-effective workforce development through experiential
learning. To meet these challenges, we present an adaptive tutoring framework
that combines generative AI with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
deliver personalized training. The framework leverages document hit rate and
Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) to optimize content for each learner, and is
benchmarked against human-generated training for alignment and relevance. We
demonstrate the framework in 4IR cybersecurity learning by creating a synthetic
QA dataset emulating trainee behavior, while RAG is tuned on curated
cybersecurity materials. Evaluation compares its generated training with
manually curated queries representing realistic student interactions. Responses
are produced using large language models (LLMs) including GPT-3.5 and GPT-4,
assessed for faithfulness and content alignment. GPT-4 achieves the best
performance with 87% relevancy and 100% alignment. Results show this dual-mode
approach enables the adaptive tutor to act as both a personalized topic
recommender and content generator, offering a scalable solution for rapid,
tailored learning in 4IR education and workforce development.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 考试准备指数（ERI）是一个综合性指标，通过聚合掌握度、覆盖度、保持率、进度、波动性和耐久性等六个信号来评估学习者的考试准备程度，具有可解释性和可操作性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提供一个理论上稳健、可解释且可行动的综合指标，用于评估学习者在重要考试中的准备状况，充分利用练习和模拟考试中的多种学习信号。

Method: 构建了一个理论框架，定义了组成指标的映射公式和聚合方法，证明了指数的单调性、利普希茨稳定性、重新权重下的有界偏移等数学性质，并在凸约束条件下证明了最优线性聚合的存在性和唯一性。

Result: 理论分析证明了ERI指数的数学性质（单调性、稳定性、有界偏移等），通过蓝图权重集中性推导了信心带，并证明了与先决条件诱导课程（知识空间/学习空间）的兼容性。

Conclusion: 该研究主要关注ERI的理论基础，为考试准备状况的评估提供了一个数学上严谨且可解释的框架，实证研究将在未来工作中进行。

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for an Exam Readiness Index (ERI): a
composite, blueprint-aware score R in [0,100] that summarizes a learner's
readiness for a high-stakes exam while remaining interpretable and actionable.
The ERI aggregates six signals -- Mastery (M), Coverage (C), Retention (R),
Pace (P), Volatility (V), and Endurance (E) -- each derived from a stream of
practice and mock-test interactions. We formalize axioms for component maps and
the composite, prove monotonicity, Lipschitz stability, and bounded drift under
blueprint re-weighting, and show existence and uniqueness of the optimal linear
composite under convex design constraints. We further characterize confidence
bands via blueprint-weighted concentration and prove compatibility with
prerequisite-admissible curricula (knowledge spaces / learning spaces). The
paper focuses on theory; empirical study is left to future work.

*Deepika Dash,Yeshil Bangera,Mithil Bangera,Gouthami Vadithya,Srikant Panda*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个系统性的可访问性基准测试框架，用于评估大语言模型在九类残疾群体中的包容性表现，发现当前模型在视力、听力和行动障碍方面表现较好，但在言语、遗传/发育、感官认知和心理健康方面存在明显不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在可访问性指导方面存在服务不均的问题，许多残疾群体得不到充分的服务。为了解决这一差距，需要建立一个系统性的评估框架来审计模型在不同残疾类别中的包容性。

Method: 开发了一个经过人工验证的通用可访问性问题基准测试，从三个维度评估模型：问题级别覆盖率（答案的广度）、残疾级别覆盖率（九类残疾类别的平衡性）和深度（支持的具体性）。

Result: 对17个专有和开源模型的评估显示，视力、听力和行动障碍经常得到解决，而言语、遗传/发育、感官认知和心理健康等领域服务不足。深度方面也存在类似的不均衡分布。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前LLM可访问性指导中的服务差距，并提出了可行的改进方向：采用分类感知的提示/训练方法，以及同时审计广度、平衡性和深度的评估体系。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for accessibility
guidance, yet many disability groups remain underserved by their advice. To
address this gap, we present taxonomy aligned benchmark1 of human validated,
general purpose accessibility questions, designed to systematically audit
inclusivity across disabilities. Our benchmark evaluates models along three
dimensions: Question-Level Coverage (breadth within answers), Disability-Level
Coverage (balance across nine disability categories), and Depth (specificity of
support). Applying this framework to 17 proprietary and open-weight models
reveals persistent inclusivity gaps: Vision, Hearing, and Mobility are
frequently addressed, while Speech, Genetic/Developmental, Sensory-Cognitive,
and Mental Health remain under served. Depth is similarly concentrated in a few
categories but sparse elsewhere. These findings reveal who gets left behind in
current LLM accessibility guidance and highlight actionable levers:
taxonomy-aware prompting/training and evaluations that jointly audit breadth,
balance, and depth.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型和AI智能体的快速发展，代理工作流在教育领域展现出变革潜力，需要从传统的线性交互转向更动态、协作的工作流模式。

Method: 提出基于von Neumann多智能体系统架构的理论框架，包含四个核心组件：自我反思、工具调用、任务规划和多智能体协作，并通过数学测试生成的案例研究验证模型有效性。

Result: 案例研究表明，AWE生成的数学测试题目与真实考试题目在统计上具有可比性，验证了模型的有效性。

Conclusion: AWE为减少教师工作量、提高教学质量和支持更广泛的教育创新提供了一条有前景的路径，在集成学习环境、个性化AI辅助学习、模拟实验和数据驱动决策等四个核心应用领域具有重要价值。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) agents, agentic workflows are showing transformative
potential in education. This study introduces the Agentic Workflow for
Education (AWE), a four-component model comprising self-reflection, tool
invocation, task planning, and multi-agent collaboration. We distinguish AWE
from traditional LLM-based linear interactions and propose a theoretical
framework grounded in the von Neumann Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture.
Through a paradigm shift from static prompt-response systems to dynamic,
nonlinear workflows, AWE enables scalable, personalized, and collaborative task
execution. We further identify four core application domains: integrated
learning environments, personalized AI-assisted learning, simulation-based
experimentation, and data-driven decision-making. A case study on automated
math test generation shows that AWE-generated items are statistically
comparable to real exam questions, validating the model's effectiveness. AWE
offers a promising path toward reducing teacher workload, enhancing
instructional quality, and enabling broader educational innovation.

TL;DR: 记者对AI加剧假信息风险的担忧：89.88%记者认为AI会大幅增加假信息风险，经验丰富者更为担忧


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI对假信息的影响，因为生成式AI的快速发展已经影响新闻制作和媒体组织，成为记者业界日益关分的问题

Method: 采用定量研究方法，对巴斯克地区504名记者进行结构化问卷调查，调查包括社会人口学、职业变量和对AI影响的态度

Result: 统计分析显示，工作经验与风险感知存在显著关联，AI使用程度也与风险感知相关。主要风险包括假内容检测困难、深度假造和获取不准确数据

Conclusion: 记者对AI在信息生态系统中的作用存在复杂而多面性的担忧，这些发现强调了记者行业面临的挑战和需要关注的问题

Abstract: This study examines journalists' perceptions of the impact of artificial
intelligence (AI) on disinformation, a growing concern in journalism due to the
rapid expansion of generative AI and its influence on news production and media
organizations. Using a quantitative approach, a structured survey was
administered to 504 journalists in the Basque Country, identified through
official media directories and with the support of the Basque Association of
Journalists. This survey, conducted online and via telephone between May and
June 2024, included questions on sociodemographic and professional variables,
as well as attitudes toward AI's impact on journalism. The results indicate
that a large majority of journalists (89.88%) believe AI will considerably or
significantly increase the risks of disinformation, and this perception is
consistent across genders and media types, but more pronounced among those with
greater professional experience. Statistical analyses reveal a significant
association between years of experience and perceived risk, and between AI use
and risk perception. The main risks identified are the difficulty in detecting
false content and deepfakes, and the risk of obtaining inaccurate or erroneous
data. Co-occurrence analysis shows that these risks are often perceived as
interconnected. These findings highlight the complex and multifaceted concerns
of journalists regarding AI's role in the information ecosystem.

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) presents a significant yet persistent
challenge in human-computer interaction. While deep learning has advanced
spoken language processing, achieving high performance on limited datasets
remains a critical hurdle. This paper confronts this issue by developing and
evaluating a suite of machine learning models, including Support Vector

Motivation: 虽然可兰经的严格诵读规则(tajweed)为语音评估提供了优势，但高质量注释数据的稀缺仍然是主要障碍，需要解决这个问题

Method: 开发了一个98%自动化的管道：收集专家诵读、使用细调的wav2vec2-BERT模型进行暂停点分割、转写段落、通过新的Tasmeea算法验证转写。还提出了自定义的可兰音义脚本(QPS)来编码Tajweed规则，以及新题的多层次CTC模型

Conclusion: 该研究成功构建了大规模、高质量的可兰语音数据集，并提出了高效的发音错误检测方法，为可兰语音识别和评估领域做出了重要贡献，所有代码、数据和模型都开源发布

Abstract: Assessing spoken language is challenging, and quantifying pronunciation
metrics for machine learning models is even harder. However, for the Holy
Quran, this task is simplified by the rigorous recitation rules (tajweed)
established by Muslim scholars, enabling highly effective assessment. Despite
this advantage, the scarcity of high-quality annotated data remains a
significant barrier.
  In this work, we bridge these gaps by introducing: (1) A 98% automated
pipeline to produce high-quality Quranic datasets -- encompassing: Collection
of recitations from expert reciters, Segmentation at pause points (waqf) using
our fine-tuned wav2vec2-BERT model, Transcription of segments, Transcript
verification via our novel Tasmeea algorithm; (2) 850+ hours of audio (~300K
annotated utterances); (3) A novel ASR-based approach for pronunciation error
detection, utilizing our custom Quran Phonetic Script (QPS) to encode Tajweed
rules (unlike the IPA standard for Modern Standard Arabic). QPS uses a
two-level script: (Phoneme level): Encodes Arabic letters with short/long
vowels. (Sifa level): Encodes articulation characteristics of every phoneme. We
further include comprehensive modeling with our novel multi-level CTC Model
which achieved 0.16% average Phoneme Error Rate (PER) on the testset. We
release all code, data, and models as open-source:

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has transformed spoken dialog
systems, yet the optimal architecture for real-time on-device voice agents
remains an open question. While end-to-end approaches promise theoretical
advantages, cascaded systems (CSs) continue to outperform them in language
understanding tasks, despite being constrained by sequential processing
latency. In this work, we introduce ChipChat, a novel low-latency CS that
overcomes traditional bottlenecks through architectural innovations and
streaming optimizations. Our system integrates streaming (a) conversational
speech recognition with mixture-of-experts, (b) state-action augmented LLM, (c)
text-to-speech synthesis, (d) neural vocoder, and (e) speaker modeling.
Implemented using MLX, ChipChat achieves sub-second response latency on a Mac
Studio without dedicated GPUs, while preserving user privacy through complete
on-device processing. Our work shows that strategically redesigned CSs can
overcome their historical latency limitations, offering a promising path
forward for practical voice-based AI agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使用混合脚本文本（如漢字和偉名）时，传统G2P转换需要手工音标注，成本高且扩展性差。该方法旨在消除对人工音标的依赖，降低成本并提高扩展性。

Method: 利用预训练语音SSL模型，训练T5编码器从混合脚本文本生成伪语言标签。该方法直接从语音生成离散标记，避免了传统的G2P转换流程。

Result: 该模型的性能与传统G2P基础的文本到语音系统相当，能够合成保留自然语言和超语言特征（如口音和语调）的语音。

Conclusion: 该方法为语音合成提供了一种更高效、更可扩展的方案，特别适用于大规模未注释音频数据集，使得语音合成更加自动化和经济。

Abstract: This study presents a novel approach to voice synthesis that can substitute
the traditional grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion by using a deep
learning-based model that generates discrete tokens directly from speech.
Utilizing a pre-trained voice SSL model, we train a T5 encoder to produce
pseudo-language labels from mixed-script texts (e.g., containing Kanji and
Kana). This method eliminates the need for manual phonetic transcription,
reducing costs and enhancing scalability, especially for large non-transcribed
audio datasets. Our model matches the performance of conventional G2P-based
text-to-speech systems and is capable of synthesizing speech that retains
natural linguistic and paralinguistic features, such as accents and
intonations.

TL;DR: 提出AHAMask方法，通过在音频语言模型的注意力头中应用选择性掩码，无需指令即可触发特定音频任务功能，解决了指令敏感性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型音频语言模型虽然扩展了文本LLM的通用音频理解能力，但存在指令敏感性问题——相同意图的不同指令会导致截然不同的结果

Method: AHAMask方法：在LALMs的解码器LLM骨干网络中掩码部分注意力头，通过仅训练与注意力头数量相等的参数来获得这些掩码，无需指令即可触发特定音频任务功能

Result: 实验表明，应用选择性注意力头掩码在单一或复合任务上都能达到与使用指令相当甚至更好的性能

Conclusion: 该方法不仅为LALMs提供了可靠的音频任务指定方式，还揭示了LALMs在其注意力头中表现出特定的"功能通路"

Abstract: Although current large audio language models (LALMs) extend text large
language models (LLMs) with generic acoustic understanding abilities, they
usually suffer from instruction sensitivity, where different instructions of
the same intention can yield drastically different outcomes. In this work, we
propose AHAMask, where we simply mask some of the attention heads in the
decoder-only LLM backbone of LALMs, to trigger specific acoustic task
functionalities without instructions. These masks are efficiently obtained by
training on an LALM, with the number of trainable parameters equal to the
attention head count in its LLM backbone. We show by experiments that applying
such selective attention head masks achieves comparable or even better
performance than using instructions, either on single or composite tasks.
Besides achieving reliable acoustic task specification for LALMs, this also
reveals that LALMs exhibit certain "functional pathways" in their attention
heads.

Conclusion: 建立了一个理解复杂自适应系统中智能驱动合作模式形成的新范式，揭示了机器学习作为多智能体网络中自发组织的替代驱动力。

Abstract: Cooperation emergence in multi-agent systems represents a fundamental
statistical physics problem where microscopic learning rules drive macroscopic
collective behavior transitions. We propose a Q-learning-based variant of
adaptive rewiring that builds on mechanisms studied in the literature. This
method combines temporal difference learning with network restructuring so that
agents can optimize strategies and social connections based on interaction
histories. Through neighbor-specific Q-learning, agents develop sophisticated
partnership management strategies that enable cooperator cluster formation,
creating spatial separation between cooperative and defective regions. Using
power-law networks that reflect real-world heterogeneous connectivity patterns,
we evaluate emergent behaviors under varying rewiring constraint levels,
revealing distinct cooperation patterns across parameter space rather than
sharp thermodynamic transitions. Our systematic analysis identifies three
behavioral regimes: a permissive regime (low constraints) enabling rapid
cooperative cluster formation, an intermediate regime with sensitive dependence
on dilemma strength, and a patient regime (high constraints) where strategic
accumulation gradually optimizes network structure. Simulation results show
that while moderate constraints create transition-like zones that suppress
cooperation, fully adaptive rewiring enhances cooperation levels through
systematic exploration of favorable network configurations. Quantitative
analysis reveals that increased rewiring frequency drives large-scale cluster
formation with power-law size distributions. Our results establish a new
paradigm for understanding intelligence-driven cooperation pattern formation in
complex adaptive systems, revealing how machine learning serves as an
alternative driving force for spontaneous organization in multi-agent networks.
