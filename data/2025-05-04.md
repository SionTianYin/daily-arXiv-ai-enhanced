### [1] [Rosetta-PL: Propositional Logic as a Benchmark for Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00001)
*Shaun Baek,Shaun Esua-Mensah,Cyrus Tsui,Sejan Vigneswaralingam,Abdullah Alali,Michael Lu,Vasu Sharma,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Rosetta-PL是一个用于评估LLMs在逻辑推理和泛化能力的基准，通过翻译逻辑命题数据集并微调LLM，研究发现翻译过程中保留逻辑关系能显著提升精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在高资源自然语言上训练，限制了其在低资源环境和深度逻辑推理任务中的表现。

Method: 将Lean中的逻辑命题数据集翻译为自定义逻辑语言，用于微调LLM（如GPT-4o），分析数据集大小和翻译方法对模型性能的影响。

Result: 翻译过程中保留逻辑关系显著提升精度，训练样本超过约20,000后准确率趋于稳定。

Conclusion: 研究为优化LLM在形式推理任务中的训练提供了指导，并有助于提升低资源语言应用的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are primarily trained on high-resource natural
languages, limiting their effectiveness in low-resource settings and in tasks
requiring deep logical reasoning. This research introduces Rosetta-PL, a
benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' logical reasoning and generalization
capabilities in a controlled environment. We construct Rosetta-PL by
translating a dataset of logical propositions from Lean into a custom logical
language, which is then used to fine-tune an LLM (e.g., GPT-4o). Our
experiments analyze the impact of the size of the dataset and the translation
methodology on the performance of the model. Our results indicate that
preserving logical relationships in the translation process significantly
boosts precision, with accuracy plateauing beyond roughly 20,000 training
samples. These insights provide valuable guidelines for optimizing LLM training
in formal reasoning tasks and improving performance in various low-resource
language applications.

### [2] [Symbol grounding in computational systems: A paradox of intentions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00002)
*Vincent C. Müller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出计算主义无法解释符号接地问题，因为无论计算是基于有意义还是无意义的符号，都会导致语义先天论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨计算主义在解释符号接地问题上的局限性，揭示其隐含的语义先天论。

Method: 通过逻辑分析，提出计算主义在符号接地问题上的两种可能性及其矛盾。

Result: 无论计算是基于有意义还是无意义的符号，计算主义都会导致语义先天论，无法解决符号接地问题。

Conclusion: 计算主义在解释符号接地问题上存在根本性缺陷，需重新审视其理论基础。

Abstract: The paper presents a paradoxical feature of computational systems that
suggests that computationalism cannot explain symbol grounding. If the mind is
a digital computer, as computationalism claims, then it can be computing either
over meaningful symbols or over meaningless symbols. If it is computing over
meaningful symbols its functioning presupposes the existence of meaningful
symbols in the system, i.e. it implies semantic nativism. If the mind is
computing over meaningless symbols, no intentional cognitive processes are
available prior to symbol grounding. In this case, no symbol grounding could
take place since any grounding presupposes intentional cognitive processes. So,
whether computing in the mind is over meaningless or over meaningful symbols,
computationalism implies semantic nativism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM规模和复杂度的增加，心理学被认为是实现类人认知、行为和互动的关键。本文旨在探讨心理学理论如何优化LLM开发，并弥合学科间的鸿沟。

Method: 整合认知、发展、行为、社会、人格心理学及心理语言学的理论，分析心理学在LLM各阶段的应用现状与不足。

Result: 揭示了心理学理论在LLM研究中的当前趋势与潜在不足，提出了跨学科整合的建议。

Conclusion: 心理学对LLM的未来研究至关重要，需更深入、系统地整合心理学理论以推动NLP发展。

Abstract: Psychological insights have long shaped pivotal NLP breakthroughs, including
the cognitive underpinnings of attention mechanisms, formative reinforcement
learning, and Theory of Mind-inspired social modeling. As Large Language Models
(LLMs) continue to grow in scale and complexity, there is a rising consensus
that psychology is essential for capturing human-like cognition, behavior, and
interaction. This paper reviews how psychological theories can inform and
enhance stages of LLM development, including data, pre-training, post-training,
and evaluation\&application. Our survey integrates insights from cognitive,
developmental, behavioral, social, personality psychology, and
psycholinguistics. Our analysis highlights current trends and gaps in how
psychological theories are applied. By examining both cross-domain connections
and points of tension, we aim to bridge disciplinary divides and promote more
thoughtful integration of psychology into future NLP research.

### [4] [LangVAE and LangSpace: Building and Probing for Language Model VAEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00004)
*Danilo S. Carvalho,Yingji Zhang,Harriet Unsworth,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LangVAE是一个基于预训练大语言模型（LLMs）构建变分自编码器（VAEs）的新框架，能够生成紧凑且语义解耦的表示。配套工具LangSpace提供多种分析方法，实验展示了其在泛化与解耦方面的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用预训练语言模型的知识，构建更高效、解耦的文本表示框架，以系统化实验和理解文本表示。

Method: 通过LangVAE框架模块化构建VAEs，结合LangSpace工具进行向量遍历、解耦度量和聚类可视化等分析。

Result: 实验表明，不同编码器-解码器组合和标注输入在泛化与解耦方面表现出多样化的交互效果。

Conclusion: LangVAE为文本表示的系统化实验和理解提供了灵活、高效的框架，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: We present LangVAE, a novel framework for modular construction of variational
autoencoders (VAEs) on top of pre-trained large language models (LLMs). Such
language model VAEs can encode the knowledge of their pre-trained components
into more compact and semantically disentangled representations. The
representations obtained in this way can be analysed with the LangVAE companion
framework: LangSpace, which implements a collection of probing methods, such as
vector traversal and interpolation, disentanglement measures, and cluster
visualisations. LangVAE and LangSpace offer a flexible, efficient and scalable
way of building and analysing textual representations, with simple integration
for models available on the HuggingFace Hub. Additionally, we conducted a set
of experiments with different encoder and decoder combinations, as well as
annotated inputs, revealing a wide range of interactions across architectural
families and sizes w.r.t. generalisation and disentanglement. Our findings
demonstrate a promising framework for systematising the experimentation and
understanding of textual representations.

### [5] [Toward a digital twin of U.S. Congress](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00006)
*Hayden Helm,Tianyi Chen,Harvey McGuinness,Paige Lee,Brandon Duderstadt,Carey E. Priebe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出基于语言模型的美国国会议员虚拟模型，证明其符合数字孪生定义，并展示生成推文可用于预测投票行为和党派倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过语言模型模拟国会议员行为，为资源分配和立法动态提供数据支持。

Method: 利用每日更新的国会议员推文数据集，训练语言模型生成逼真推文，并分析其预测能力。

Result: 模型生成的推文与真实推文难以区分，并能有效预测投票行为和党派倾向。

Conclusion: 研究展示了数字孪生在政治分析中的潜力，但也指出局限性和未来扩展方向。

Abstract: In this paper we provide evidence that a virtual model of U.S.
congresspersons based on a collection of language models satisfies the
definition of a digital twin. In particular, we introduce and provide
high-level descriptions of a daily-updated dataset that contains every Tweet
from every U.S. congressperson during their respective terms. We demonstrate
that a modern language model equipped with congressperson-specific subsets of
this data are capable of producing Tweets that are largely indistinguishable
from actual Tweets posted by their physical counterparts. We illustrate how
generated Tweets can be used to predict roll-call vote behaviors and to
quantify the likelihood of congresspersons crossing party lines, thereby
assisting stakeholders in allocating resources and potentially impacting
real-world legislative dynamics. We conclude with a discussion of the
limitations and important extensions of our analysis.

### [7] [Efficient Knowledge Transfer in Multi-Task Learning through Task-Adaptive Low-Rank Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00009)
*Xiao Zhang,Kangsheng Wang,Tianyu Hu,Huimin Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TA-LoRA是一种基于提示调优的多任务学习方法，通过低秩表示和快慢权重机制解决任务异质性，提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型在新任务上表现不佳，多任务学习虽能共享知识，但提示调优难以捕捉任务异质性。

Method: 提出TA-LoRA，结合低秩表示和快慢权重机制，避免共享与任务特定知识混淆，并引入零初始化注意力机制。

Result: 在16个任务上验证，TA-LoRA在完整数据和少样本设置下均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: TA-LoRA有效解决了任务异质性，同时保持了参数高效性。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) demonstrate remarkable intelligence but
struggle with emerging tasks unseen during training in real-world applications.
Training separate models for each new task is usually impractical. Multi-task
learning (MTL) addresses this challenge by transferring shared knowledge from
source tasks to target tasks. As an dominant parameter-efficient fine-tuning
method, prompt tuning (PT) enhances MTL by introducing an adaptable vector that
captures task-specific knowledge, which acts as a prefix to the original prompt
that preserves shared knowledge, while keeping PLM parameters frozen. However,
PT struggles to effectively capture the heterogeneity of task-specific
knowledge due to its limited representational capacity. To address this
challenge, we propose Task-Adaptive Low-Rank Representation (TA-LoRA), an MTL
method built on PT, employing the low-rank representation to model task
heterogeneity and a fast-slow weights mechanism where the slow weight encodes
shared knowledge, while the fast weight captures task-specific nuances,
avoiding the mixing of shared and task-specific knowledge, caused by training
low-rank representations from scratch. Moreover, a zero-initialized attention
mechanism is introduced to minimize the disruption of immature low-rank
components on original prompts during warm-up epochs. Experiments on 16 tasks
demonstrate that TA-LoRA achieves state-of-the-art performance in full-data and
few-shot settings while maintaining superior parameter efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析语言特征检测LLM中的越狱行为，发现基于特征的方法优于提示工程，模糊决策树表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教育等领域中LLM的越狱行为威胁其安全使用，需有效检测方法。

Method: 标注2300多个提示，提取语言特征，训练多种预测模型（如决策树、模糊逻辑分类器等）。

Result: 基于特征的模型优于提示工程，模糊决策树表现最佳。

Conclusion: 语言特征模型是有效且可解释的越狱检测方法，建议未来研究结合提示和规则框架。

Abstract: Jailbreaking in Large Language Models (LLMs) threatens their safe use in
sensitive domains like education by allowing users to bypass ethical
safeguards. This study focuses on detecting jailbreaks in 2-Sigma, a clinical
education platform that simulates patient interactions using LLMs. We annotated
over 2,300 prompts across 158 conversations using four linguistic variables
shown to correlate strongly with jailbreak behavior. The extracted features
were used to train several predictive models, including Decision Trees, Fuzzy
Logic-based classifiers, Boosting methods, and Logistic Regression. Results
show that feature-based predictive models consistently outperformed Prompt
Engineering, with the Fuzzy Decision Tree achieving the best overall
performance. Our findings demonstrate that linguistic-feature-based models are
effective and explainable alternatives for jailbreak detection. We suggest
future work explore hybrid frameworks that integrate prompt-based flexibility
with rule-based robustness for real-time, spectrum-based jailbreak monitoring
in educational LLMs.

### [10] [Performance Evaluation of Emotion Classification in Japanese Using RoBERTa and DeBERTa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00013)
*Yoichi Takenaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究旨在构建高精度模型预测日语文本中的八种Plutchik情绪，DeBERTa-v3-large表现最佳，优于其他模型和大型语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日语文本情绪检测在社交媒体监控和客户反馈分析中有实际需求，但资源稀缺和类别不平衡影响了模型性能。

Method: 使用WRIME语料库，将读者平均强度分数转化为二元标签，并微调四种预训练语言模型（BERT、RoBERTa、DeBERTa-v3-base、DeBERTa-v3-large），同时评估两种大型语言模型（TinySwallow-1.5B-Instruct和ChatGPT-4o）。

Result: DeBERTa-v3-large取得最佳平均准确率（0.860）和F1分数（0.662），优于其他模型。大型语言模型表现较差。

Conclusion: 微调的DeBERTa-v3-large模型是目前日语二元情绪分类的最可靠解决方案，未来需增强稀有情绪数据、减小模型规模并探索提示工程以提升大型语言模型性能。

Abstract: Background Practical applications such as social media monitoring and
customer-feedback analysis require accurate emotion detection for Japanese
text, yet resource scarcity and class imbalance hinder model performance.
  Objective This study aims to build a high-accuracy model for predicting the
presence or absence of eight Plutchik emotions in Japanese sentences.
  Methods Using the WRIME corpus, we transform reader-averaged intensity scores
into binary labels and fine-tune four pre-trained language models (BERT,
RoBERTa, DeBERTa-v3-base, DeBERTa-v3-large). For context, we also assess two
large language models (TinySwallow-1.5B-Instruct and ChatGPT-4o). Accuracy and
F1-score serve as evaluation metrics.
  Results DeBERTa-v3-large attains the best mean accuracy (0.860) and F1-score
(0.662), outperforming all other models. It maintains robust F1 across both
high-frequency emotions (e.g., Joy, Anticipation) and low-frequency emotions
(e.g., Anger, Trust). The LLMs lag, with ChatGPT-4o and
TinySwallow-1.5B-Instruct scoring 0.527 and 0.292 in mean F1, respectively.
  Conclusion The fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3-large model currently offers the most
reliable solution for binary emotion classification in Japanese. We release
this model as a pip-installable package (pip install
deberta-emotion-predictor). Future work should augment data for rare emotions,
reduce model size, and explore prompt engineering to improve LLM performance.
  This manuscript is under review for possible publication in New Generation
Computing.

### [11] [Manifold-Constrained Sentence Embeddings via Triplet Loss: Projecting Semantics onto Spheres, Tori, and Möbius Strips](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00014)
*Vinit K. Chavan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新颖的框架，将句子嵌入限制在连续流形（如单位球面、环面和莫比乌斯带）上，通过三元组损失训练，显著提升了聚类和分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统句子嵌入在欧几里得空间中可能无法充分反映语言的复杂关系，因此探索流形约束的嵌入方法以更好地捕捉语义结构。

Method: 使用三元组损失训练，将句子嵌入约束在单位球面、环面和莫比乌斯带上，利用微分几何约束优化输出空间。

Result: 在AG News和MBTI数据集上，流形约束嵌入（尤其是球面和莫比乌斯带）在聚类质量（Silhouette Score）和分类性能（Accuracy）上显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 流形空间嵌入通过拓扑结构补充语义分离，为NLP中的几何表示学习提供了新的数学基础方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in representation learning have emphasized the role of
embedding geometry in capturing semantic structure. Traditional sentence
embeddings typically reside in unconstrained Euclidean spaces, which may limit
their ability to reflect complex relationships in language. In this work, we
introduce a novel framework that constrains sentence embeddings to lie on
continuous manifolds -- specifically the unit sphere, torus, and M\"obius strip
-- using triplet loss as the core training objective. By enforcing differential
geometric constraints on the output space, our approach encourages the learning
of embeddings that are both discriminative and topologically structured.
  We evaluate our method on benchmark datasets (AG News and MBTI) and compare
it to classical baselines including TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and unconstrained
Keras-derived embeddings. Our results demonstrate that manifold-constrained
embeddings, particularly those projected onto spheres and M\"obius strips,
significantly outperform traditional approaches in both clustering quality
(Silhouette Score) and classification performance (Accuracy). These findings
highlight the value of embedding in manifold space -- where topological
structure complements semantic separation -- offering a new and mathematically
grounded direction for geometric representation learning in NLP.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）和网络爬虫技术的自动化系统，用于解决孟加拉国交通事故数据收集的不可靠性问题。系统通过四个模块实现自动化，并在实际应用中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发展中国家如孟加拉国的交通事故数据收集存在手动、分散和不可靠的问题，导致数据缺失和不一致。研究旨在通过自动化系统解决这些问题。

Method: 系统包括四个模块：自动化网络爬虫代码生成、新闻收集、事故新闻分类与结构化数据提取、去重。使用多模态生成LLM Gemini-2.0-Flash实现自动化。

Result: 系统在111天内从14个新闻网站收集了15,000多篇文章，识别出705起独特事故。代码生成模块准确率为91.3%，验证准确率为80%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于LLM的自动化系统能够高效、准确地收集交通事故数据，为数据驱动的道路安全政策制定提供了基础。

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a major public safety and socio-economic issue
in developing countries like Bangladesh. Existing accident data collection is
largely manual, fragmented, and unreliable, resulting in underreporting and
inconsistent records. This research proposes a fully automated system using
Large Language Models (LLMs) and web scraping techniques to address these
challenges. The pipeline consists of four components: automated web scraping
code generation, news collection from online sources, accident news
classification with structured data extraction, and duplicate removal. The
system uses the multimodal generative LLM Gemini-2.0-Flash for seamless
automation. The code generation module classifies webpages into pagination,
dynamic, or infinite scrolling categories and generates suitable Python scripts
for scraping. LLMs also classify and extract key accident information such as
date, time, location, fatalities, injuries, road type, vehicle types, and
pedestrian involvement. A deduplication algorithm ensures data integrity by
removing duplicate reports. The system scraped 14 major Bangladeshi news sites
over 111 days (Oct 1, 2024 - Jan 20, 2025), processing over 15,000 news
articles and identifying 705 unique accidents. The code generation module
achieved 91.3% calibration and 80% validation accuracy. Chittagong reported the
highest number of accidents (80), fatalities (70), and injuries (115), followed
by Dhaka, Faridpur, Gazipur, and Cox's Bazar. Peak accident times were morning
(8-9 AM), noon (12-1 PM), and evening (6-7 PM). A public repository was also
developed with usage instructions. This study demonstrates the viability of an
LLM-powered, scalable system for accurate, low-effort accident data collection,
providing a foundation for data-driven road safety policymaking in Bangladesh.

### [13] [Sparks of Tabular Reasoning via Text2SQL Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00016)
*Josefa Lia Stoisser,Marc Boubnovski Martell,Julien Fauqueur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文将Text-to-SQL任务重新定义为教授大型语言模型（LLM）推理和操作表格数据的途径，提出两阶段框架以提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Text-to-SQL任务仅关注查询生成，而本文旨在通过SQL监督开发可迁移的表格推理能力。

Method: 1. 从真实SQL查询生成详细的链式思维（CoT）跟踪，提供逐步监督；2. 引入GRPO强化学习目标，将SQL执行准确性与泛化推理能力关联。

Result: 在标准Text-to-SQL基准和BIRD、CRT-QA等推理密集型数据集上表现显著提升，LLaMA模型准确率提高20%，Qwen提高5%。

Conclusion: SQL不仅是目标形式，还能作为学习结构化数据推理的有效支架，提升模型的泛化性和可解释性。

Abstract: This work reframes the Text-to-SQL task as a pathway for teaching large
language models (LLMs) to reason over and manipulate tabular data--moving
beyond the traditional focus on query generation. We propose a two-stage
framework that leverages SQL supervision to develop transferable table
reasoning capabilities. First, we synthesize detailed chain-of-thought (CoT)
traces from real-world SQL queries, providing step-by-step, clause-level
supervision that teaches the model how to traverse, filter, and aggregate table
fields. Second, we introduce a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
reinforcement learning objective that connects SQL execution accuracy to
generalizable reasoning by encouraging steps that extend beyond task-specific
syntax and transfer across datasets. Empirically, our approach improves
performance on standard Text-to-SQL benchmarks and achieves substantial gains
on reasoning-intensive datasets such as BIRD and CRT-QA, demonstrating enhanced
generalization and interpretability. Specifically, the distilled-quantized
LLaMA model achieved a 20\% increase in accuracy when trained on Text-to-SQL
tasks, while Qwen achieved a 5\% increase. These results suggest that SQL can
serve not only as a target formalism but also as an effective scaffold for
learning robust, transferable reasoning over structured data.

language models (LLMs), we developed a graph structured feature marker database
to retrieve entities linked to differential genes for cell reconstruction. We
further designed a multi task workflow to optimize the annotation process.
Compared to general purpose LLMs, our method improves human evaluation scores
by up to 0.21 and semantic similarity by 6.1% across 11 tissue types, while
more closely aligning with the cognitive logic of manual annotation.

complexity and economic costs. To address this issue, we study six prompt
compression methods for LLMs, aiming to reduce prompt length while maintaining
LLM response quality. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis
covering aspects such as generation performance, model hallucinations, efficacy
in multimodal tasks, word omission analysis, and more. We evaluate these
methods across 13 datasets, including news, scientific articles, commonsense
QA, math QA, long-context QA, and VQA datasets. Our experiments reveal that
prompt compression has a greater impact on LLM performance in long contexts
compared to short ones. In the Longbench evaluation, moderate compression even
enhances LLM performance. Our code and data is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究使用DE-COP方法分析OpenAI模型是否未经许可使用了O'Reilly的版权内容，发现GPT-4o对付费内容识别率高，而GPT-3.5 Turbo更擅长识别公开内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨OpenAI模型是否未经授权使用了受版权保护的内容，以呼吁企业提高训练数据透明度。

Method: 使用DE-COP成员推理攻击方法，测试不同OpenAI模型对O'Reilly书籍内容的识别能力。

Result: GPT-4o对付费内容识别率较高（AUROC=82%），GPT-3.5 Turbo更擅长公开内容，GPT-4o Mini无显著识别能力。

Conclusion: 研究强调企业需提高训练数据透明度，并建立正式的内容授权框架。

Abstract: Using a legally obtained dataset of 34 copyrighted O'Reilly Media books, we
apply the DE-COP membership inference attack method to investigate whether
OpenAI's large language models were trained on copyrighted content without
consent. Our AUROC scores show that GPT-4o, OpenAI's more recent and capable
model, demonstrates strong recognition of paywalled O'Reilly book content
(AUROC = 82\%), compared to OpenAI's earlier model GPT-3.5 Turbo. In contrast,
GPT-3.5 Turbo shows greater relative recognition of publicly accessible
O'Reilly book samples. GPT-4o Mini, as a much smaller model, shows no knowledge
of public or non-public O'Reilly Media content when tested (AUROC $\approx$
50\%). Testing multiple models, with the same cutoff date, helps us account for
potential language shifts over time that might bias our findings. These results
highlight the urgent need for increased corporate transparency regarding
pre-training data sources as a means to develop formal licensing frameworks for
AI content training

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食品危害检测任务面临类别不平衡、文本短且非结构化、语义类别重叠等挑战，亟需改进分类方法。

Method: 使用BERT和RoBERTa作为基础分类器，结合随机过采样、EDA和焦点损失等数据平衡策略。

Result: 实验表明，EDA有效缓解类别不平衡，显著提升准确率和F1分数；结合焦点损失和过采样进一步增强了模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为食品危害检测提供了更有效的NLP分类模型，尤其适用于难分类样本。

Abstract: Classification tasks often suffer from imbal- anced data distribution, which
presents chal- lenges in food hazard detection due to severe class imbalances,
short and unstructured text, and overlapping semantic categories. In this
paper, we present our system for SemEval- 2025 Task 9: Food Hazard Detection,
which ad- dresses these issues by applying data augmenta- tion techniques to
improve classification perfor- mance. We utilize transformer-based models, BERT
and RoBERTa, as backbone classifiers and explore various data balancing
strategies, including random oversampling, Easy Data Augmentation (EDA), and
focal loss. Our ex- periments show that EDA effectively mitigates class
imbalance, leading to significant improve- ments in accuracy and F1 scores.
Furthermore, combining focal loss with oversampling and EDA further enhances
model robustness, par- ticularly for hard-to-classify examples. These findings
contribute to the development of more effective NLP-based classification models
for food hazard detection.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合启发式和模型过滤技术的数据集构建方法，并生成合成数据，显著提升了德语大语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据质量对大语言模型性能至关重要，但现有德语数据集质量不足，需要改进。

Method: 采用启发式和模型过滤技术，结合合成数据生成，构建了Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb数据集。

Result: 在德语基准测试中，新数据集显著优于FineWeb2，甚至在8B规模下优于人工精选数据。

Conclusion: 模型驱动的数据筛选和合成数据生成能显著提升预训练数据集质量。

Abstract: Scaling data quantity is essential for large language models (LLMs), yet
recent findings show that data quality can significantly boost performance and
training efficiency. We introduce a German-language dataset curation pipeline
that combines heuristic and model-based filtering techniques with synthetic
data generation. We use our pipeline to create Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb, a
large-scale German pre-training dataset which draws from: (1) Common Crawl web
data, (2) FineWeb2, and (3) synthetically-generated data conditioned on actual,
organic web data. We evaluate our dataset by pre-training both a 1B Llama-style
model and an 8B tokenizer-free hierarchical autoregressive transformer (HAT). A
comparison on German-language benchmarks, including MMMLU, shows significant
performance gains of Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb over FineWeb2 alone. This advantage
holds at the 8B scale even when FineWeb2 is enriched by human-curated
high-quality data sources such as Wikipedia. Our findings support the growing
body of evidence that model-based data curation and synthetic data generation
can significantly enhance LLM pre-training datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实语料库中知识重复但存在不一致性，语言模型难以处理复杂上下文关系。

Method: CORG框架包含图构造器、重排序器和聚合器，将上下文分组独立处理。

Result: CORG在性能和效率上表现优异，优于现有分组方法，接近计算密集型单上下文方法。

Conclusion: CORG有效解决多上下文关系问题，平衡性能与效率。

Abstract: In a real-world corpus, knowledge frequently recurs across documents but
often contains inconsistencies due to ambiguous naming, outdated information,
or errors, leading to complex interrelationships between contexts. Previous
research has shown that language models struggle with these complexities,
typically focusing on single factors in isolation. We classify these
relationships into four types: distracting, ambiguous, counterfactual, and
duplicated. Our analysis reveals that no single approach effectively addresses
all these interrelationships simultaneously. Therefore, we introduce Context
Organizer (CORG), a framework that organizes multiple contexts into
independently processed groups. This design allows the model to efficiently
find all relevant answers while ensuring disambiguation. CORG consists of three
key components: a graph constructor, a reranker, and an aggregator. Our results
demonstrate that CORG balances performance and efficiency effectively,
outperforming existing grouping methods and achieving comparable results to
more computationally intensive, single-context approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在工具调用能力上存在不足，要么忽略推理，要么模仿推理限制泛化能力。

Method: 采用类似DeepSeek-R1的规则强化学习范式，仅监督工具调用的结构有效性和功能正确性。

Result: Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1-7B/14B在BFCL和API-Bank基准测试中超越GPT-4o，达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 轻量级监督方法能有效提升语言模型的工具调用能力，无需复杂推理标注。

Abstract: Enabling large language models with external tools has become a pivotal
strategy for extending their functionality beyond text generation tasks. Prior
work typically enhances tool-use abilities by either applying supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) to enforce tool-call correctness or distilling reasoning
traces from stronger models for SFT. However, both approaches fall short,
either omitting reasoning entirely or producing imitative reasoning that limits
generalization. Inspired by the success of DeepSeek-R1 in eliciting reasoning
through rule-based reinforcement learning, we develop the
Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1 series of tool-using language models using a similar
training paradigm. Instead of restrictively supervising intermediate reasoning
traces distilled from stronger models, Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1 is optimized
with a binary reward that evaluates only the structural validity and functional
correctness of tool invocations. This lightweight supervision allows the model
to autonomously internalize reasoning strategies, without the need for
annotated reasoning trajectories. Experiments on the BFCL and API-Bank
benchmarks show that Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1-7B and
Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1-14B, built on Qwen-2.5-7B/14B-Instruct, achieve
state-of-the-art results, outperforming GPT-4o on both evaluations.

Result: 在医疗问答数据集上，该方法在保持专业准确性的同时，内存消耗减少64.7%，推理延迟降低12.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限环境（如边缘计算设备）中的医疗大模型应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, despite foundation models like DeepSeek-R1 and ChatGPT
demonstrating significant capabilities in general tasks, professional knowledge
barriers, computational resource requirements, and deployment environment
limitations have severely hindered their application in actual medical
scenarios. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient
lightweight medical vertical large language model architecture method,
systematically solving the lightweight problem of medical large models from
three dimensions: knowledge acquisition, model compression, and computational
optimization. At the knowledge acquisition level, a knowledge transfer pipeline
is designed from the fine-tuned DeepSeek-R1-Distill-70B teacher model to the
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B student model, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technology
is adopted to precisely adjust key attention layers. At the model compression
level, compression techniques including 4-bit weight quantization are
implemented while preserving the core representation ability for medical
reasoning. At the computational optimization level, inference optimization
techniques such as Flash Attention acceleration and continuous batching are
integrated, and a professional prompt template system is constructed to adapt
to different types of medical problems. Experimental results on medical
question-answering datasets show that the method proposed in this paper
maintains professional accuracy while reducing memory consumption by 64.7\% and
inference latency by 12.4\%, providing an effective solution for the
application of medical large models in resource-constrained environments such
as edge computing devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高文本操作的效率和自然语言查询的准确性。

Method: 通过构建高质量的抽象树表示主语、动作、宾语和状语及其子类关系，确保独立性和表达力。

Result: 实验显示抽象树的平均精确率、召回率和F1分数均超过80%，支持快速搜索和精确定位目标句子。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效支持自然语言查询，并在文本操作中表现出高覆盖率和精确性。

Abstract: This paper proposed an approach to automatically discovering subject
dimension, action dimension, object dimension and adverbial dimension from
texts to efficiently operate texts and support query in natural language. The
high quality of trees guarantees that all subjects, actions, objects and
adverbials and their subclass relations within texts can be represented. The
independency of trees ensures that there is no redundant representation between
trees. The expressiveness of trees ensures that the majority of sentences can
be accessed from each tree and the rest of sentences can be accessed from at
least one tree so that the tree-based search mechanism can support querying in
natural language. Experiments show that the average precision, recall and
F1-score of the abstraction trees constructed by the subclass relations of
subject, action, object and adverbial are all greater than 80%. The application
of the proposed approach to supporting query in natural language demonstrates
that different types of question patterns for querying subject or object have
high coverage of texts, and searching multiple trees on subject, action, object
and adverbial according to the question pattern can quickly reduce search space
to locate target sentences, which can support precise operation on texts.

Conclusion: 该框架为端到端语音对话系统的知识整合提供了有前景的方向，代码和数据集将公开以促进研究。

Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end speech-to-speech (S2S) dialogue systems have
garnered increasing research attention due to their advantages over traditional
cascaded systems, including achieving lower latency and more natural
integration of nonverbal cues such as emotion and speaker identity. However,
these end-to-end systems face key challenges, particularly in incorporating
external knowledge, a capability commonly addressed by Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) in text-based large language models (LLMs). The core
difficulty lies in the modality gap between input speech and retrieved textual
knowledge, which hinders effective integration. To address this issue, we
propose a novel end-to-end RAG framework that directly retrieves relevant
textual knowledge from speech queries, eliminating the need for intermediate
speech-to-text conversion via techniques like ASR. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of
end-to-end S2S dialogue systems while achieving higher retrieval efficiency.
Although the overall performance still lags behind cascaded models, our
framework offers a promising direction for enhancing knowledge integration in
end-to-end S2S systems. We will release the code and dataset to support
reproducibility and promote further research in this area.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在融入专业领域知识时易遗忘基础能力，需解决这一困境。

Method: 采用三阶段对话结构：基础保留、对比消歧和知识专业化。

Result: 实验证明SDFT在多个领域能平衡专业知识获取与通用能力保留。

Conclusion: SDFT提供了一种数据中心的对话模板，平衡基础对齐与知识整合。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models have demonstrated impressive versatile
capabilities through extensive multimodal pre-training, but face significant
limitations when incorporating specialized knowledge domains beyond their
training distribution. These models struggle with a fundamental dilemma: direct
adaptation approaches that inject domain-specific knowledge often trigger
catastrophic forgetting of foundational visual-linguistic abilities. We
introduce Structured Dialogue Fine-Tuning (SDFT), an effective approach that
effectively injects domain-specific knowledge while minimizing catastrophic
forgetting. Drawing inspiration from supervised fine-tuning in LLMs and
subject-driven personalization in text-to-image diffusion models, our method
employs a three-phase dialogue structure: Foundation Preservation reinforces
pre-trained visual-linguistic alignment through caption tasks; Contrastive
Disambiguation introduces carefully designed counterfactual examples to
maintain semantic boundaries; and Knowledge Specialization embeds specialized
information through chain-of-thought reasoning. Experimental results across
multiple domains confirm SDFT's effectiveness in balancing specialized
knowledge acquisition with general capability retention. Our key contributions
include a data-centric dialogue template that balances foundational alignment
with targeted knowledge integration, a weighted multi-turn supervision
framework, and comprehensive evaluation across diverse knowledge types.

Motivation: 探讨语言模型在模拟历史文本风格时的准确性，以避免时代错误的风险。

Method: 通过提示和微调当代模型，比较其输出与真实历史文本的差异，并使用自动和人工评估。

Result: 提示无法模拟历史风格，微调虽能欺骗自动评估，但人工仍能区分。

Conclusion: 可能需要预训练模型以更可靠地模拟历史文本风格。

Abstract: Before researchers can use language models to simulate the past, they need to
understand the risk of anachronism. We find that prompting a contemporary model
with examples of period prose does not produce output consistent with period
style. Fine-tuning produces results that are stylistically convincing enough to
fool an automated judge, but human evaluators can still distinguish fine-tuned
model outputs from authentic historical text. We tentatively conclude that
pretraining on period prose may be required in order to reliably simulate
historical perspectives for social research.

Motivation: 现有方法仅生成逐步解决方案，缺乏对抽象元知识的捕捉，限制了模型的泛化能力。受认知科学启发，作者希望通过引入抽象计划来改进这一问题。

Result: LEPA在多个自然语言推理基准测试中显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 通过引入抽象计划作为元知识，LEPA有效提升了模型的泛化能力和推理表现。

Abstract: In the field of large language model (LLM) post-training, the effectiveness
of utilizing synthetic data generated by the LLM itself has been
well-presented. However, a key question remains unaddressed: what essential
information should such self-generated data encapsulate? Existing approaches
only produce step-by-step problem solutions, and fail to capture the abstract
meta-knowledge necessary for generalization across similar problems. Drawing
insights from cognitive science, where humans employ high-level abstraction to
simplify complex problems before delving into specifics, we introduce a novel
self-training algorithm: LEarning to Plan before Answering (LEPA). LEPA trains
the LLM to formulate anticipatory plans, which serve as abstract meta-knowledge
for problem-solving, before engaging with the intricacies of problems. This
approach not only outlines the solution generation path but also shields the
LLM from the distraction of irrelevant details. During data generation, LEPA
first crafts an anticipatory plan based on the problem, and then generates a
solution that aligns with both the plan and the problem. LEPA refines the plan
through self-reflection, aiming to acquire plans that are instrumental in
yielding correct solutions. During model optimization, the LLM is trained to
predict both the refined plans and the corresponding solutions. By efficiently
extracting and utilizing the anticipatory plans, LEPA demonstrates remarkable
superiority over conventional algorithms on various challenging natural
language reasoning benchmarks.

Motivation: 全球抑郁症患者超过3亿，但医疗资源分布不均和诊断方法复杂导致许多地区对该疾病的关注不足。

Method: 利用UK Biobank队列中的274,348条个体数据，设计表格数据转换方法，训练和评估基于LLMs的MDD-LLM框架。

Result: MDD-LLM（70B）在准确率（0.8378）和AUC（0.8919）上显著优于现有机器学习与深度学习框架。

Conclusion: MDD-LLM为抑郁症诊断提供了高效工具，并探讨了影响性能的关键因素。

Abstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD) impacts more than 300 million people
worldwide, highlighting a significant public health issue. However, the uneven
distribution of medical resources and the complexity of diagnostic methods have
resulted in inadequate attention to this disorder in numerous countries and
regions. This paper introduces a high-performance MDD diagnosis tool named
MDD-LLM, an AI-driven framework that utilizes fine-tuned large language models
(LLMs) and extensive real-world samples to tackle challenges in MDD diagnosis.
Therefore, we select 274,348 individual information from the UK Biobank cohort
to train and evaluate the proposed method. Specifically, we select 274,348
individual records from the UK Biobank cohort and design a tabular data
transformation method to create a large corpus for training and evaluating the
proposed approach. To illustrate the advantages of MDD-LLM, we perform
comprehensive experiments and provide several comparative analyses against
existing model-based solutions across multiple evaluation metrics. Experimental
results show that MDD-LLM (70B) achieves an accuracy of 0.8378 and an AUC of
0.8919 (95% CI: 0.8799 - 0.9040), significantly outperforming existing machine
learning and deep learning frameworks for MDD diagnosis. Given the limited
exploration of LLMs in MDD diagnosis, we examine numerous factors that may
influence the performance of our proposed method, such as tabular data
transformation techniques and different fine-tuning strategies.

Motivation: 自注意力机制的二次计算复杂度限制了Transformer的可扩展性，需要一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 结合时间域（嵌入重建）和频率域（短时傅里叶变换幅度匹配）的重建损失，以及高斯混合模型（GMM）先验，学习混合系数。

Result: 在WikiText2和Penn Treebank等基准测试中取得了与Transformer基线相当的困惑度和生成质量，同时显著降低了推理延迟和内存占用。

Conclusion: 谱字典模型为可扩展语言建模提供了一种高效且性能优异的替代方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel spectral generative modeling framework for natural
language processing that jointly learns a global time varying Fourier
dictionary and per token mixing coefficients, replacing the ubiquitous self
attention mechanism in transformer architectures. By enforcing reconstruction
losses in both the time domain (embedding reconstruction) and the frequency
domain (via Short Time Fourier Transform magnitude matching) alongside a
standard language modeling objective, and fitting a Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) prior over the learned mixing vectors, our approach achieves competitive
perplexity and generation quality on standard benchmarks such as WikiText2 and
Penn Treebank. In contrast to the quadratic computation complexity of self
attention, our method operates with linear complexity, delivering substantial
efficiency gains. We demonstrate that spectral dictionary models can achieve
competitive performance compared to transformer baselines while significantly
reducing inference latency and memory footprint, offering a compelling
alternative for scalable language modeling.

Abstract: Large language models(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on many

contain billions or even tens of billions of parameters, requiring enormous
computational resources. To reduce computational costs, we investigated the
effectiveness of small-parameter LLMs for phishing email detection. These LLMs
have around 3 billion parameters and can run on consumer-grade GPUs. However,
small LLMs often perform poorly in phishing email detection task. To address
these issues, we designed a set of methods including Prompt Engineering,
Explanation Augmented Fine-tuning, and Model Ensemble to improve phishing email
detection capabilities of small LLMs. We validated the effectiveness of our
approach through experiments, significantly improving accuracy on the

increase in vocabulary diversity over the study period, with East Coast artists
demonstrating 17.3% higher lexical variation than other regions. Rhyme density
increased by 34.2% across all regions, with Midwest artists exhibiting the
highest technical complexity (3.04 rhymes per line). Topic modeling identified
significant shifts in thematic content, with social justice themes decreasing
from 28.5% to 13.8% of content while introspective themes increased from 7.6%
to 26.3%. Sentiment analysis demon- strated that lyrics became significantly
more negative during sociopolitical crises, with polarity decreasing by 0.31
following major social unrest. Multi-dimensional analysis revealed four dis-
tinct stylistic approaches that correlate strongly with geographic origin
(r=0.68, p!0.001) and time period (r=0.59, p<0.001). These findings establish
quantitative evidence for the evolution of hip- hop as both an art form and a
reflection of societal dynamics, providing insights into the interplay between
linguistic innovation and cultural context in popular music.

### [32] [A Framework to Assess the Persuasion Risks Large Language Model Chatbots Pose to Democratic Societies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00036)
*Zhongren Chen,Joshua Kalla,Quan Le,Shinpei Nakamura-Sakai,Jasjeet Sekhon,Ruixiao Wang*

TL;DR: LLMs的劝说能力在政治领域的效果与传统竞选方法相当，但成本更低，但目前难以规模化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs是否比传统政治竞选方法更具成本效益的劝说能力。

Method: 通过两项调查实验和真实世界模拟，评估LLMs与人类互动及短期和长期劝说效果。

Result: LLMs每说服一名选民的成本为48-74美元，低于传统的100美元，但传统方法更易规模化。

Conclusion: 目前LLMs在政治劝说中未显著优于传统方法，但随着技术发展，潜力可能提升。

Abstract: In recent years, significant concern has emerged regarding the potential
threat that Large Language Models (LLMs) pose to democratic societies through
their persuasive capabilities. We expand upon existing research by conducting
two survey experiments and a real-world simulation exercise to determine
whether it is more cost effective to persuade a large number of voters using
LLM chatbots compared to standard political campaign practice, taking into
account both the "receive" and "accept" steps in the persuasion process (Zaller
1992). These experiments improve upon previous work by assessing extended
interactions between humans and LLMs (instead of using single-shot
interactions) and by assessing both short- and long-run persuasive effects
(rather than simply asking users to rate the persuasiveness of LLM-produced
content). In two survey experiments (N = 10,417) across three distinct
political domains, we find that while LLMs are about as persuasive as actual
campaign ads once voters are exposed to them, political persuasion in the
real-world depends on both exposure to a persuasive message and its impact
conditional on exposure. Through simulations based on real-world parameters, we
estimate that LLM-based persuasion costs between \$48-\$74 per persuaded voter
compared to \$100 for traditional campaign methods, when accounting for the
costs of exposure. However, it is currently much easier to scale traditional
campaign persuasion methods than LLM-based persuasion. While LLMs do not
currently appear to have substantially greater potential for large-scale
political persuasion than existing non-LLM methods, this may change as LLM
capabilities continue to improve and it becomes easier to scalably encourage
exposure to persuasive LLMs.

### [33] [HyPerAlign: Hypotheses-driven Personalized Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00038)
*Cristina Garbacea,Chenhao Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于假设驱动的个性化方法（HyPerAlign），通过少量用户示例推断其偏好和风格，从而生成定制化LLM输出，优于传统的基于偏好的微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM通常针对“平均用户”偏好进行对齐，但实际使用中需要针对个体用户的个性化输出。

Method: 提出HyPerAlign方法，通过少量用户示例推断其沟通策略、个性和写作风格，并基于这些假设生成定制化输出。

Result: 在作者归属和协商对齐任务中，HyPerAlign显著优于传统方法，协商对齐任务中帮助性提升70%，作者归属任务中胜率超过90%。

Conclusion: HyPerAlign是一种高效且可解释的LLM个性化方法，适用于多样化的用户和任务。

Abstract: Alignment algorithms are widely used to align large language models (LLMs) to
human users based on preference annotations that reflect their intended
real-world use cases. Typically these (often divergent) preferences are
aggregated over a diverse set of users, resulting in fine-tuned models that are
aligned to the ``average-user'' preference. Nevertheless, current models are
used by individual users in very specific contexts and situations, emphasizing
the need for user-dependent preference control. In this work we address the
problem of personalizing LLM outputs to their users, aiming to generate
customized responses tailored to individual users, instead of generic outputs
that emulate the collective voices of diverse populations. We propose a novel
interpretable and sample-efficient hypotheses-driven personalization approach
(HyPerAlign) where given few-shot examples written by a particular user, we
first infer hypotheses about their communication strategies, personality and
writing style, then prompt LLM models with these hypotheses and user specific
attributes to generate customized outputs. We conduct experiments on two
different personalization tasks, authorship attribution and deliberative
alignment, with datasets from diverse domains (news articles, blog posts,
emails, jailbreaking benchmarks), and demonstrate the superiority of
hypotheses-driven personalization approach when compared to preference-based
fine-tuning methods. For deliberative alignment, the helpfulness of LLM models
is improved by up to $70\%$ on average. For authorship attribution, results
indicate consistently high win-rates (commonly $>90\%$) against
state-of-the-art preference fine-tuning approaches for LLM personalization
across diverse user profiles and LLM models. Overall, our approach represents
an interpretable and sample-efficient strategy for the personalization of LLM
models to individual users.

Motivation: 法律规范具有层次结构、引用网络和多版本特点，传统方法难以处理其复杂性。

Method: 结合层次结构和时间演化的知识图谱，以及综合文本单元，构建更丰富的法律知识表示。

Result: Graph RAG在法律规范数据集上的应用显著提升了法律领域的人工智能研究效果。

Conclusion: 该方法为法律研究、立法分析和决策支持提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: This article proposes an adaptation of Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation
(Graph RAG) specifically designed for the analysis and comprehension of legal
norms, which are characterized by their predefined hierarchical structure,
extensive network of internal and external references and multiple temporal
versions. By combining structured knowledge graphs with contextually enriched
text segments, Graph RAG offers a promising solution to address the inherent
complexity and vast volume of legal data. The integration of hierarchical
structure and temporal evolution into knowledge graphs - along with the concept
of comprehensive Text Units - facilitates the construction of richer,
interconnected representations of legal knowledge. Through a detailed analysis
of Graph RAG and its application to legal norm datasets, this article aims to
significantly advance the field of Artificial Intelligence applied to Law,
creating opportunities for more effective systems in legal research,
legislative analysis, and decision support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨对齐技术是否应普遍适用，揭示其在某些任务中的局限性。

Method: 研究随机数生成、混合策略游戏和创意写作等任务，对比基础模型与对齐模型的表现。

Result: 对齐模型在不可预测任务中表现较差，倾向于产生狭窄行为，如偏好特定数字或可预测的游戏策略。

Conclusion: 对齐技术与基础模型能力存在权衡，需根据任务需求选择合适模型。

Abstract: Alignment has quickly become a default ingredient in LLM development, with
techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback making models act
safely, follow instructions, and perform ever-better on complex tasks. While
these techniques are certainly useful, we propose that they should not be
universally applied and demonstrate a range of tasks on which base language
models consistently outperform their popular aligned forms. Particularly, we
study tasks that require unpredictable outputs, such as random number
generation, mixed strategy games (rock-paper-scissors and hide-and-seek), and
creative writing. In each case, aligned models tend towards narrow behaviors
that result in distinct disadvantages, for instance, preferring to generate "7"
over other uniformly random numbers, becoming almost fully predictable in some
game states, or prioritizing pleasant writing over creative originality. Across
models tested, better performance on common benchmarks tends to correlate with
worse performance on our tasks, suggesting an effective trade-off in the
required capabilities.

Motivation: 探索社交媒体情感分析在预测时尚趋势中的潜力。

Method: 使用T4SA数据集，结合自然语言处理和机器学习技术，进行情感分类、时间序列分解、因果关系建模等分析。

Result: 发现情感模式与时尚主题流行度相关，配饰和街头服饰趋势显著；预测模型准确率达78.35%。

Conclusion: 社交媒体情感分析可作为时尚趋势预测的有效工具，需结合统计验证。

Abstract: This study explores the intersection of fashion trends and social media
sentiment through computational analysis of Twitter data using the T4SA
(Twitter for Sentiment Analysis) dataset. By applying natural language
processing and machine learning techniques, we examine how sentiment patterns
in fashion-related social media conversations can serve as predictors for
emerging fashion trends. Our analysis involves the identification and
categorization of fashion-related content, sentiment classification with
improved normalization techniques, time series decomposition, statistically
validated causal relationship modeling, cross-platform sentiment comparison,
and brand-specific sentiment analysis. Results indicate correlations between
sentiment patterns and fashion theme popularity, with accessories and
streetwear themes showing statistically significant rising trends. The Granger
causality analysis establishes sustainability and streetwear as primary trend
drivers, showing bidirectional relationships with several other themes. The
findings demonstrate that social media sentiment analysis can serve as an
effective early indicator of fashion trend trajectories when proper statistical
validation is applied. Our improved predictive model achieved 78.35% balanced
accuracy in sentiment classification, establishing a reliable foundation for
trend prediction across positive, neutral, and negative sentiment categories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络迷因聚类对毒性检测、传播建模和分类至关重要，但现有方法因多模态、文化背景和适应性不足而表现不佳。

Method: 采用模板匹配和多维相似性特征（如形式、视觉内容、文本和身份），结合局部和全局特征进行聚类。

Result: 新方法优于现有聚类方法，生成更一致和连贯的聚类，且支持自适应匹配。

Conclusion: 该方法无需预定义数据库，支持适应性，并公开代码以促进后续研究。

Abstract: Meme clustering is critical for toxicity detection, virality modeling, and
typing, but it has received little attention in previous research. Clustering
similar Internet memes is challenging due to their multimodality, cultural
context, and adaptability. Existing approaches rely on databases, overlook
semantics, and struggle to handle diverse dimensions of similarity. This paper
introduces a novel method that uses template-based matching with
multi-dimensional similarity features, thus eliminating the need for predefined
databases and supporting adaptive matching. Memes are clustered using local and
global features across similarity categories such as form, visual content,
text, and identity. Our combined approach outperforms existing clustering
methods, producing more consistent and coherent clusters, while
similarity-based feature sets enable adaptability and align with human
intuition. We make all supporting code publicly available to support subsequent
research. Code: https://github.com/tygobl/meme-clustering

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ASR在许多指标上接近人类水平，但在复杂真实场景（如远距离语音）中表现不佳。现有数据集多关注多麦克风阵列系统，缺乏多样性。

Method: 收集了98位演员在不同家庭环境中的英语语音数据，包含多种口音、情绪和距离条件，使用智能手机录制。

Result: ASR性能随距离和喊叫程度下降，情绪识别表现不一。BERSt数据集对ASR和SER任务具有挑战性。

Conclusion: BERSt数据集为复杂场景下的语音识别研究提供了新资源，但系统鲁棒性仍需改进。

Abstract: Some speech recognition tasks, such as automatic speech recognition (ASR),
are approaching or have reached human performance in many reported metrics.
Yet, they continue to struggle in complex, real-world, situations, such as with
distanced speech. Previous challenges have released datasets to address the
issue of distanced ASR, however, the focus remains primarily on distance,
specifically relying on multi-microphone array systems. Here we present the
B(asic) E(motion) R(andom phrase) S(hou)t(s) (BERSt) dataset. The dataset
contains almost 4 hours of English speech from 98 actors with varying regional
and non-native accents. The data was collected on smartphones in the actors
homes and therefore includes at least 98 different acoustic environments. The
data also includes 7 different emotion prompts and both shouted and spoken
utterances. The smartphones were places in 19 different positions, including
obstructions and being in a different room than the actor. This data is
publicly available for use and can be used to evaluate a variety of speech
recognition tasks, including: ASR, shout detection, and speech emotion
recognition (SER). We provide initial benchmarks for ASR and SER tasks, and
find that ASR degrades both with an increase in distance and shout level and
shows varied performance depending on the intended emotion. Our results show
that the BERSt dataset is challenging for both ASR and SER tasks and continued
work is needed to improve the robustness of such systems for more accurate
real-world use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在商业智能（BI）中的应用因语义幻觉、结构错误和缺乏领域特定评估框架而受限。

Method: 构建了一个包含219个自然语言商业问题的领域特定基准，评估了Exaone 3.5的性能。

Result: Exaone 3.5在简单聚合任务中表现良好（93%准确率），但在算术推理（4%）和分组排名任务（31%）中表现不佳。

Conclusion: LLM在商业关键环境中仍有局限性，需要事实一致性验证层和混合推理方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in enabling natural language
interfaces for structured data querying through text-to-SQL generation.
However, their application in real-world Business Intelligence (BI) contexts
remains limited due to semantic hallucinations, structural errors, and a lack
of domain-specific evaluation frameworks. In this study, we propose a
Fact-Consistency Evaluation Framework for assessing the semantic accuracy of
LLM-generated SQL outputs using Exaone 3.5--an instruction-tuned, bilingual LLM
optimized for enterprise tasks. We construct a domain-specific benchmark
comprising 219 natural language business questions across five SQL complexity
levels, derived from actual sales data in LG Electronics' internal BigQuery
environment. Each question is paired with a gold-standard SQL query and a
validated ground-truth answer. We evaluate model performance using answer
accuracy, execution success rate, semantic error rate, and non-response rate.
Experimental results show that while Exaone 3.5 performs well on simple
aggregation tasks (93% accuracy in L1), it exhibits substantial degradation in
arithmetic reasoning (4% accuracy in H1) and grouped ranking tasks (31% in H4),
with semantic errors and non-responses concentrated in complex cases.
Qualitative error analysis further identifies common failure types such as
misapplied arithmetic logic, incomplete filtering, and incorrect grouping
operations. Our findings highlight the current limitations of LLMs in
business-critical environments and underscore the need for fact-consistency
validation layers and hybrid reasoning approaches. This work contributes a
reproducible benchmark and evaluation methodology for advancing reliable
natural language interfaces to structured enterprise data systems.

Abstract: This study examines vulnerabilities in transformer-based automated
short-answer grading systems used in medical education, with a focus on how
these systems can be manipulated through adversarial gaming strategies. Our
research identifies three main types of gaming strategies that exploit the
system's weaknesses, potentially leading to false positives. To counteract
these vulnerabilities, we implement several adversarial training methods
designed to enhance the systems' robustness. Our results indicate that these
methods significantly reduce the susceptibility of grading systems to such
manipulations, especially when combined with ensemble techniques like majority
voting and ridge regression, which further improve the system's defense against
sophisticated adversarial inputs. Additionally, employing large language models
such as GPT-4 with varied prompting techniques has shown promise in recognizing
and scoring gaming strategies effectively. The findings underscore the
importance of continuous improvements in AI-driven educational tools to ensure
their reliability and fairness in high-stakes settings.

Conclusion: GDI-Bench和GDI模型为文档智能领域提供了有效的评估和改进工具，两者将开源。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
profoundly impacted the document domain, creating a wide array of application
scenarios. This progress highlights the need for a comprehensive benchmark to
evaluate these models' capabilities across various document-specific tasks.
However, existing benchmarks often fail to locate specific model weaknesses or
guide systematic improvements. To bridge this gap, we introduce a General
Document Intelligence Benchmark (GDI-Bench), featuring 1.9k images across 9 key
scenarios and 19 document-specific tasks. By decoupling visual complexity and
reasoning complexity, the GDI-Bench structures graded tasks that allow
performance assessment by difficulty, aiding in model weakness identification
and optimization guidance. We evaluate the GDI-Bench on various open-source and
closed-source models, conducting decoupled analyses in the visual and reasoning
domains. For instance, the GPT-4o model excels in reasoning tasks but exhibits
limitations in visual capabilities. To address the diverse tasks and domains in
the GDI-Bench, we propose a GDI Model that mitigates the issue of catastrophic
forgetting during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) process through a
intelligence-preserving training strategy. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance on previous benchmarks and the GDI-Bench. Both our benchmark and
model will be open source.

Result: 实验证明该指标能有效识别答案是否基于上下文，且计算高效、可解释、适应性强。

Conclusion: 新指标为开放书问答系统提供了一种可扩展且实用的上下文利用评估方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable success in
open-book question answering (QA), where the task requires generating answers
grounded in a provided external context. A critical challenge in open-book QA
is to ensure that model responses are based on the provided context rather than
its parametric knowledge, which can be outdated, incomplete, or incorrect.
Existing evaluation methods, primarily based on the LLM-as-a-judge approach,
face significant limitations, including biases, scalability issues, and
dependence on costly external systems. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel metric that contrasts the perplexity of the model response under two
conditions: when the context is provided and when it is not. The resulting
score quantifies the extent to which the model's answer relies on the provided
context. The validity of this metric is demonstrated through a series of
experiments that show its effectiveness in identifying whether a given answer
is grounded in the provided context. Unlike existing approaches, this metric is
computationally efficient, interpretable, and adaptable to various use cases,
offering a scalable and practical solution to assess context utilization in
open-book QA systems.

Motivation: 探讨文化真实性数据在低资源方言翻译中的重要性，挑战“数据越多越好”的范式。

Method: 使用开源Aya23模型，比较基础、对比和语法提示三种微调方法，并引入LebEval新基准。

Result: 文化感知的小数据集（LW）表现优于大规模非本地数据，对比微调结合对比提示效果最佳。

Conclusion: 文化真实性在方言翻译中至关重要，挑战了传统的数据规模优先观念。

Abstract: This paper examines the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
translating the low-resource Lebanese dialect, focusing on the impact of
culturally authentic data versus larger translated datasets. We compare three
fine-tuning approaches: Basic, contrastive, and grammar-hint tuning, using
open-source Aya23 models. Experiments reveal that models fine-tuned on a
smaller but culturally aware Lebanese dataset (LW) consistently outperform
those trained on larger, non-native data. The best results were achieved
through contrastive fine-tuning paired with contrastive prompting, which
indicates the benefits of exposing translation models to bad examples. In
addition, to ensure authentic evaluation, we introduce LebEval, a new benchmark
derived from native Lebanese content, and compare it to the existing FLoRes
benchmark. Our findings challenge the "More Data is Better" paradigm and
emphasize the crucial role of cultural authenticity in dialectal translation.
We made our datasets and code available on Github.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在推理长度与答案正确性之间的关系，揭示模型可能误判问题难度并无法合理调整响应长度。

Method: 系统实证研究推理长度与答案正确性的关系，并利用偏好优化算法减少生成长度。

Result: LLMs对简单问题过度推理，复杂问题推理不足；通过长度减少可保持准确性。

Conclusion: 生成长度是推理行为的重要信号，需进一步探索LLMs在推理长度适应中的自我意识。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly optimized for long reasoning,
under the assumption that more reasoning leads to better performance. However,
emerging evidence suggests that longer responses can sometimes degrade accuracy
rather than improve it. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study
of the relationship between reasoning length and answer correctness. We find
that LLMs tend to overthink simple problems, generating unnecessarily long
outputs, and underthink harder ones, failing to extend their reasoning when it
is most needed. This indicates that models might misjudge problem difficulty
and fail to calibrate their response length appropriately. Furthermore, we
investigate the effects of length reduction with a preference optimization
algorithm when simply preferring the shorter responses regardless of answer
correctness. Experiments show that the generation length can be significantly
reduced while maintaining acceptable accuracy. Our findings highlight
generation length as a meaningful signal for reasoning behavior and motivate
further exploration into LLMs' self-awareness in reasoning length adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现技能提示策略在大型语言模型（LLMs）中有效，但在小语言模型（SLMs）中可能因信息过载而降低性能，需针对性改进。

Method: 提出AdaptMI和AdaptMI+方法，基于认知负荷理论，仅在模型表现不佳时引入技能示例，并针对缺失技能补充示例。

Result: 在数学基准测试中，AdaptMI+比传统技能策略提升准确率高达6%。

Conclusion: 自适应技能提示策略可有效提升SLMs在ICL中的性能，避免认知过载。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows a language model to improve its
problem-solving capability when provided with suitable information in context.
Since the choice of in-context information can be determined based on the
problem itself, in-context learning is analogous to human learning from
teachers in a classroom. Recent works (Didolkar et al., 2024a; 2024b) show that
ICL performance can be improved by leveraging a frontier large language model's
(LLM) ability to predict required skills to solve a problem, popularly referred
to as an LLM's metacognition, and using the recommended skills to construct
necessary in-context examples. While this skill-based strategy boosts ICL
performance in larger models, its gains on small language models (SLMs) have
been minimal, highlighting a performance gap in ICL capabilities. We
investigate this gap and show that skill-based prompting can hurt SLM
performance on easy questions by introducing unnecessary information, akin to
cognitive overload. To address this, we introduce AdaptMI, an adaptive approach
to selecting skill-based in-context Math Instructions for SLMs. Inspired by
cognitive load theory from human pedagogy, our method only introduces
skill-based examples when the model performs poorly. We further propose
AdaptMI+, which adds examples targeted to the specific skills missing from the
model's responses. On 5-shot evaluations across popular math benchmarks and
five SLMs (1B--7B; Qwen, Llama), AdaptMI+ improves accuracy by up to 6% over
naive skill-based strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI方法在放射学报告分析中缺乏可解释性，阻碍了临床应用。

Method: 结合信息追踪框架提取关键查询，使用Flan-T5模型判断事实存在，并通过分类器预测疾病。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架有望增强医学AI的可信度和实用性。

Abstract: The development of AI-based methods for analyzing radiology reports could
lead to significant advances in medical diagnosis--from improving diagnostic
accuracy to enhancing efficiency and reducing workload. However, the lack of
interpretability in these methods has hindered their adoption in clinical
settings. In this paper, we propose an interpretable-by-design framework for
classifying radiology reports. The key idea is to extract a set of most
informative queries from a large set of reports and use these queries and their
corresponding answers to predict a diagnosis. Thus, the explanation for a
prediction is, by construction, the set of selected queries and answers. We use
the Information Pursuit framework to select informative queries, the Flan-T5
model to determine if facts are present in the report, and a classifier to
predict the disease. Experiments on the MIMIC-CXR dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, highlighting its potential to enhance
trust and usability in medical AI.

Result: 研究发现需要建立稳健的基准和多学科方法来确保语言模型在特定任务中的一致性。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁加强一致性研究，以提升语言模型在应用中的可靠性和适应性。

Abstract: The hallmark of effective language use lies in consistency -- expressing
similar meanings in similar contexts and avoiding contradictions. While human
communication naturally demonstrates this principle, state-of-the-art language
models struggle to maintain reliable consistency across different scenarios.
This paper examines the landscape of consistency research in AI language
systems, exploring both formal consistency (including logical rule adherence)
and informal consistency (such as moral and factual coherence). We analyze
current approaches to measure aspects of consistency, identify critical
research gaps in standardization of definitions, multilingual assessment, and
methods to improve consistency. Our findings point to an urgent need for robust
benchmarks to measure and interdisciplinary approaches to ensure consistency in
the application of language models on domain-specific tasks while preserving
the utility and adaptability.

Result: LLM在明确标记的分类中表现良好，但在上下文推理任务中人类评估者更准确。

Conclusion: KoACD数据集和方法为未来认知扭曲检测研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Cognitive distortion refers to negative thinking patterns that can lead to
mental health issues like depression and anxiety in adolescents. Previous
studies using natural language processing (NLP) have focused mainly on
small-scale adult datasets, with limited research on adolescents. This study
introduces KoACD, the first large-scale dataset of cognitive distortions in
Korean adolescents, containing 108,717 instances. We applied a multi-Large
Language Model (LLM) negotiation method to refine distortion classification and
generate synthetic data using two approaches: cognitive clarification for
textual clarity and cognitive balancing for diverse distortion representation.
Validation through LLMs and expert evaluations showed that while LLMs
classified distortions with explicit markers, they struggled with
context-dependent reasoning, where human evaluators demonstrated higher
accuracy. KoACD aims to enhance future research on cognitive distortion
detection.

Motivation: 生成式预训练语言模型在学术界和工业界占据主导地位，但缺乏针对其的高效无监督文本表示框架。

Method: 提出CSE-SFP方法，利用生成模型的结构特性，仅需单次前向传播完成无监督对比学习。

Result: 实验表明CSE-SFP生成更高质量的嵌入，同时显著减少训练时间和内存消耗。

Conclusion: CSE-SFP为生成式模型提供了高效的句子表示解决方案，并引入新指标评估语义空间特性。

Abstract: As a fundamental task in Information Retrieval and Computational Linguistics,
sentence representation has profound implications for a wide range of practical
applications such as text clustering, content analysis, question-answering
systems, and web search. Recent advances in pre-trained language models (PLMs)
have driven remarkable progress in this field, particularly through
unsupervised embedding derivation methods centered on discriminative PLMs like
BERT. However, due to time and computational constraints, few efforts have
attempted to integrate unsupervised sentence representation with generative
PLMs, which typically possess much larger parameter sizes. Given that
state-of-the-art models in both academia and industry are predominantly based
on generative architectures, there is a pressing need for an efficient
unsupervised text representation framework tailored to decoder-only PLMs. To
address this concern, we propose CSE-SFP, an innovative method that exploits
the structural characteristics of generative models. Compared to existing
strategies, CSE-SFP requires only a single forward pass to perform effective
unsupervised contrastive learning. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that
CSE-SFP not only produces higher-quality embeddings but also significantly
reduces both training time and memory consumption. Furthermore, we introduce
two ratio metrics that jointly assess alignment and uniformity, thereby
providing a more robust means for evaluating the semantic spatial properties of
encoding models.

Motivation: 识别法律中的监管语句有助于衡量法规密度和严格性，但现有方法定义不一，需更具体的方法。

Method: 基于机构语法工具定义监管语句，开发并比较依赖解析和Transformer模型两种方法。

Result: 两种方法准确率分别为80%和84%，K alpha为0.58，表现相似但一致性不高。

Conclusion: 两种方法各有优势，结合使用可能提升效果。

Abstract: Identifying regulatory statements in legislation is useful for developing
metrics to measure the regulatory density and strictness of legislation. A
computational method is valuable for scaling the identification of such
statements from a growing body of EU legislation, constituting approximately
180,000 published legal acts between 1952 and 2023. Past work on extraction of
these statements varies in the permissiveness of their definitions for what
constitutes a regulatory statement. In this work, we provide a specific
definition for our purposes based on the institutional grammar tool. We develop
and compare two contrasting approaches for automatically identifying such
statements in EU legislation, one based on dependency parsing, and the other on
a transformer-based machine learning model. We found both approaches performed
similarly well with accuracies of 80% and 84% respectively and a K alpha of
0.58. The high accuracies and not exceedingly high agreement suggests potential
for combining strengths of both approaches.

Conclusion: HalluMix Benchmark为幻觉检测提供了更全面的评估工具，揭示了现有系统的局限性，对实际应用（如RAG）有重要启示。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes
domains, detecting hallucinated content$\unicode{x2013}$text that is not
grounded in supporting evidence$\unicode{x2013}$has become a critical
challenge. Existing benchmarks for hallucination detection are often
synthetically generated, narrowly focused on extractive question answering, and
fail to capture the complexity of real-world scenarios involving multi-document
contexts and full-sentence outputs. We introduce the HalluMix Benchmark, a
diverse, task-agnostic dataset that includes examples from a range of domains
and formats. Using this benchmark, we evaluate seven hallucination detection
systems$\unicode{x2013}$both open and closed
source$\unicode{x2013}$highlighting differences in performance across tasks,
document lengths, and input representations. Our analysis highlights
substantial performance disparities between short and long contexts, with
critical implications for real-world Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
implementations. Quotient Detections achieves the best overall performance,
with an accuracy of 0.82 and an F1 score of 0.84.

Abstract: The recent development of reasoning language models (RLMs) represents a novel
evolution in large language models. In particular, the recent release of
DeepSeek-R1 has generated widespread social impact and sparked enthusiasm in
the research community for exploring the explicit reasoning paradigm of
language models. However, the implementation details of the released models
have not been fully open-sourced by DeepSeek, including DeepSeek-R1-Zero,
DeepSeek-R1, and the distilled small models. As a result, many replication
studies have emerged aiming to reproduce the strong performance achieved by
DeepSeek-R1, reaching comparable performance through similar training
procedures and fully open-source data resources. These works have investigated
feasible strategies for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning
from verifiable rewards (RLVR), focusing on data preparation and method design,
yielding various valuable insights. In this report, we provide a summary of
recent replication studies to inspire future research. We primarily focus on
SFT and RLVR as two main directions, introducing the details for data
construction, method design and training procedure of current replication
studies. Moreover, we conclude key findings from the implementation details and
experimental results reported by these studies, anticipating to inspire future
research. We also discuss additional techniques of enhancing RLMs, highlighting
the potential of expanding the application scope of these models, and
discussing the challenges in development. By this survey, we aim to help
researchers and developers of RLMs stay updated with the latest advancements,
and seek to inspire new ideas to further enhance RLMs.

Motivation: LLM在实际应用中（如医疗和法律）的幻觉问题日益突出，亟需一种系统方法来理解和量化这种现象。

Method: 设计了Hallucination-Inducing Prompt（HIP）和Hallucination Quantifying Prompt（HQP），通过融合语义遥远的概念触发幻觉，并量化输出的合理性、置信度和连贯性。

Result: 实验表明，HIP能显著降低输出的连贯性并增加幻觉，不同LLM的表现存在差异。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究LLM的幻觉脆弱性提供了可重复的测试平台，并为开发更安全的模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) present a growing challenge
across real-world applications, from healthcare to law, where factual
reliability is essential. Despite advances in alignment and instruction tuning,
LLMs can still generate outputs that are fluent yet fundamentally untrue.
Understanding the cognitive dynamics that underlie these hallucinations remains
an open problem. In this study, we propose a prompt-based framework to
systematically trigger and quantify hallucination: a Hallucination-Inducing
Prompt (HIP), which synthetically fuses semantically distant concepts (e.g.,
periodic table of elements and tarot divination) in a misleading way, and a
Hallucination Quantifying Prompt (HQP), which scores the plausibility,
confidence, and coherence of the output. Controlled experiments across multiple
LLMs revealed that HIPs consistently produced less coherent and more
hallucinated responses than their null-fusion controls. These effects varied
across models, with reasoning-oriented LLMs showing distinct profiles from
general-purpose ones. Our framework provides a reproducible testbed for
studying hallucination vulnerability, and opens the door to developing safer,
more introspective LLMs that can detect and self-regulate the onset of
conceptual instability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展LLM的上下文窗口对长内容生成至关重要，但现有方法在长上下文下性能下降，KV缓存内存需求和自注意力复杂度成为挑战。

Method: 利用KV缓存在频域中能量集中于低频的特性，过滤高频成分，提出FreqKV技术，迭代压缩KV缓存至固定大小。

Result: 实验表明，FreqKV在长上下文任务中高效且有效，无需额外参数或架构修改。

Conclusion: FreqKV通过频域压缩显著提升了LLM的长上下文处理能力。

Abstract: Extending the context window in large language models (LLMs) is essential for
applications involving long-form content generation. However, the linear
increase in key-value (KV) cache memory requirements and the quadratic
complexity of self-attention with respect to sequence length present
significant challenges during fine-tuning and inference. Existing methods
suffer from performance degradation when extending to longer contexts. In this
work, we introduce a novel context extension method that optimizes both
fine-tuning and inference efficiency. Our method exploits a key observation: in
the frequency domain, the energy distribution of the KV cache is primarily
concentrated in low-frequency components. By filtering out the high-frequency
components, the KV cache can be effectively compressed with minimal information
loss. Building on this insight, we propose an efficient compression technique,
FreqKV, that iteratively compresses the increasing KV cache to a fixed size in
the frequency domain, applicable to both fine-tuning and inference. FreqKV
introduces no additional parameters or architectural modifications. With
minimal fine-tuning, LLMs can learn to leverage the limited cache that is
compressed in the frequency domain and extend the context window efficiently.
Experiments on various long context language modeling and understanding tasks
demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed method.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is difficult due to their huge model

fine-tuning costs. We propose a block circulant matrix-based fine-tuning method

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch requires significant
computational resources, driving interest in developing smaller,
domain-specific LLMs that maintain both efficiency and strong task performance.
Medium-sized models such as LLaMA, llama} have served as starting points for
domain-specific adaptation, but they often suffer from accuracy degradation
when tested on specialized datasets. We introduce FineScope, a framework for
deriving compact, domain-optimized LLMs from larger pretrained models.
FineScope leverages the Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) framework, inspired by its
ability to produce interpretable feature representations, to extract
domain-specific subsets from large datasets. We apply structured pruning with
domain-specific constraints, ensuring that the resulting pruned models retain
essential knowledge for the target domain. To further enhance performance,
these pruned models undergo self-data distillation, leveraging SAE-curated
datasets to restore key domain-specific information lost during pruning.
Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that FineScope achieves
highly competitive performance, outperforming several large-scale
state-of-the-art LLMs in domain-specific tasks. Additionally, our results show
that FineScope enables pruned models to regain a substantial portion of their
original performance when fine-tuned with SAE-curated datasets. Furthermore,
applying these datasets to fine-tune pretrained LLMs without pruning also
improves their domain-specific accuracy, highlighting the robustness of our
approach. The code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保LLM能准确区分不同角色的输入（如系统指令、用户查询等）对多角色行为的一致性至关重要。现有方法是否真正教会模型区分角色尚不明确。

Method: 提出一个简单、受控的实验框架，发现微调模型依赖任务类型和文本起始位置作为代理。通过调整输入编码中的标记信号（如位置ID）来强化角色边界。

Result: 调整位置ID有助于模型更清晰地区分角色，减少对表面代理的依赖。数据增强仅能部分缓解问题。

Conclusion: 通过机制中心视角，论文展示了如何让LLM更可靠地维持多角色行为，而不仅仅是记忆已知提示或触发器。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) that integrate multiple input roles (e.g.,
system instructions, user queries, external tool outputs) are increasingly
prevalent in practice. Ensuring that the model accurately distinguishes
messages from each role -- a concept we call \emph{role separation} -- is
crucial for consistent multi-role behavior. Although recent work often targets
state-of-the-art prompt injection defenses, it remains unclear whether such
methods truly teach LLMs to differentiate roles or merely memorize known
triggers. In this paper, we examine \emph{role-separation learning}: the
process of teaching LLMs to robustly distinguish system and user tokens.
Through a \emph{simple, controlled experimental framework}, we find that
fine-tuned models often rely on two proxies for role identification: (1) task
type exploitation, and (2) proximity to begin-of-text. Although data
augmentation can partially mitigate these shortcuts, it generally leads to
iterative patching rather than a deeper fix. To address this, we propose
reinforcing \emph{invariant signals} that mark role boundaries by adjusting
token-wise cues in the model's input encoding. In particular, manipulating
position IDs helps the model learn clearer distinctions and reduces reliance on
superficial proxies. By focusing on this mechanism-centered perspective, our
work illuminates how LLMs can more reliably maintain consistent multi-role
behavior without merely memorizing known prompts or triggers.

experiments, anecdotal conversations between LLMs and humans, statistical
linguistic analysis, philosophical considerations, and more. In this brief
paper we present a counter-argument based upon a thought experiment and
semi-formal considerations leading to an inherent ambiguity barrier which
prevents LLMs from having any understanding of what their amazingly fluent
dialogues mean.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现微调后的模型在某些情况下泛化能力不足，而上下文学习表现更好，因此探索两者差异并提出改进方法。

Method: 构建新数据集以隔离预训练知识，通过微调和上下文学习对比模型表现，并提出结合上下文推理的微调方法。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit exciting capabilities, yet can show
surprisingly narrow generalization from finetuning -- from failing to
generalize to simple reversals of relations they are trained on, to missing
logical deductions that can be made from trained information. These failures to
generalize from fine-tuning can hinder practical application of these models.
However, language models' in-context learning shows different inductive biases,
and can generalize better in some of these cases. Here, we explore these
differences in generalization between in-context- and fine-tuning-based
learning. To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and
improve models' ability to generalize from finetuning data. The datasets are
constructed to isolate the knowledge in the dataset from that in pretraining,
to create clean tests of generalization. We expose pretrained large models to
controlled subsets of the information in these datasets -- either in context,
or through fine-tuning -- and evaluate their performance on test sets that
require various types of generalization. We find overall that in data-matched
settings, in-context learning can generalize more flexibly than fine-tuning
(though we also find some qualifications of prior findings, such as cases when
fine-tuning can generalize to reversals embedded in a larger structure of
knowledge). We build on these findings to propose a method to enable improved
generalization from fine-tuning: adding in-context inferences to finetuning
data. We show that this method improves generalization across various splits of
our datasets and other benchmarks. Our results have implications for
understanding the inductive biases of different modes of learning in language
models, and practically improving their performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段框架，通过生成详细的长篇批评数据并强化学习，提升LLM在数学问题中的批评能力，显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM快速发展，提供准确反馈和规模化监督成为迫切需求，利用LLM作为批评模型实现自动化监督是一种有前景的解决方案。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1）使用Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct生成4.5K长篇批评数据用于监督微调；2）通过强化学习进一步优化模型。

Result: 基于Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct的批评模型在错误识别基准上显著优于现有模型（如DeepSeek-R1-distill和GPT-4o），并能提供更详细的反馈帮助修正错误。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了LLM的数学批评能力，为自动化监督提供了新思路。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving, providing accurate
feedback and scalable oversight on their outputs becomes an urgent and critical
problem. Leveraging LLMs as critique models to achieve automated supervision is
a promising solution. In this work, we focus on studying and enhancing the math
critique ability of LLMs. Current LLM critics provide critiques that are too
shallow and superficial on each step, leading to low judgment accuracy and
struggling to offer sufficient feedback for the LLM generator to correct
mistakes. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel and effective two-stage
framework to develop LLM critics that are capable of deliberately critiquing on
each reasoning step of math solutions. In the first stage, we utilize
Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to generate 4.5K long-form critiques as seed data for
supervised fine-tuning. Each seed critique consists of deliberate step-wise
critiques that includes multi-perspective verifications as well as in-depth
critiques of initial critiques for each reasoning step. Then, we perform
reinforcement learning on the fine-tuned model with either existing
human-labeled data from PRM800K or our automatically annotated data obtained
via Monte Carlo sampling-based correctness estimation, to further incentivize
its critique ability. Our developed critique model built on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct
not only significantly outperforms existing LLM critics (including the
same-sized DeepSeek-R1-distill models and GPT-4o) on various error
identification benchmarks, but also more effectively helps the LLM generator
refine erroneous steps through more detailed feedback.

Abstract: Memory is a fundamental component of AI systems, underpinning large language
models (LLMs) based agents. While prior surveys have focused on memory
applications with LLMs, they often overlook the atomic operations that underlie
memory dynamics. In this survey, we first categorize memory representations
into parametric, contextual structured, and contextual unstructured and then
introduce six fundamental memory operations: Consolidation, Updating, Indexing,
Forgetting, Retrieval, and Compression. We systematically map these operations
to the most relevant research topics across long-term, long-context, parametric
modification, and multi-source memory. By reframing memory systems through the
lens of atomic operations and representation types, this survey provides a
structured and dynamic perspective on research, benchmark datasets, and tools
related to memory in AI, clarifying the functional interplay in LLMs based
agents while outlining promising directions for future research\footnote{The

Conclusion: 基于语域分析的提示方法为LLMs在风格转换任务中提供了更有效的指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
rewriting text across various styles. However, effectively leveraging this
ability for example-based arbitrary style transfer, where an input text is
rewritten to match the style of a given exemplar, remains an open challenge. A
key question is how to describe the style of the exemplar to guide LLMs toward
high-quality rewrites. In this work, we propose a prompting method based on
register analysis to guide LLMs to perform this task. Empirical evaluations
across multiple style transfer tasks show that our prompting approach enhances
style transfer strength while preserving meaning more effectively than existing
prompting strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单次检测器中因空间分辨率和语义丰富度之间的权衡导致的小物体检测难题。

Method: 基于SSD框架，引入FMB、FRB和FFB模块，通过特征匹配、加权聚合和特征融合增强浅层特征。

Result: 显著提升了小物体检测的准确性，同时保持实时检测性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂视觉环境中的鲁棒物体检测提供了新方向。

Abstract: Detecting small objects remains a significant challenge in single-shot object
detectors due to the inherent trade-off between spatial resolution and semantic
richness in convolutional feature maps. To address this issue, we propose a
novel framework that enables small object representations to "borrow"
discriminative features from larger, semantically richer instances within the
same class. Our architecture introduces three key components: the Feature
Matching Block (FMB) to identify semantically similar descriptors across
layers, the Feature Representing Block (FRB) to generate enhanced shallow
features through weighted aggregation, and the Feature Fusion Block (FFB) to
refine feature maps by integrating original, borrowed, and context information.
Built upon the SSD framework, our method improves the descriptive capacity of
shallow layers while maintaining real-time detection performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach significantly boosts small object
detection accuracy over baseline methods, offering a promising direction for
robust object detection in complex visual environments.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have gained significant attention in
computational pathology due to their multimodal learning capabilities that
enhance big-data analytics of giga-pixel whole slide image (WSI). However,
their sensitivity to large-scale clinical data, task formulations, and prompt
design remains an open question, particularly in terms of diagnostic accuracy.
In this paper, we present a systematic investigation and analysis of three
state of the art VLMs for histopathology, namely Quilt-Net, Quilt-LLAVA, and
CONCH, on an in-house digestive pathology dataset comprising 3,507 WSIs, each
in giga-pixel form, across distinct tissue types. Through a structured ablative
study on cancer invasiveness and dysplasia status, we develop a comprehensive
prompt engineering framework that systematically varies domain specificity,
anatomical precision, instructional framing, and output constraints. Our
findings demonstrate that prompt engineering significantly impacts model
performance, with the CONCH model achieving the highest accuracy when provided
with precise anatomical references. Additionally, we identify the critical
importance of anatomical context in histopathological image analysis, as
performance consistently degraded when reducing anatomical precision. We also
show that model complexity alone does not guarantee superior performance, as
effective domain alignment and domain-specific training are critical. These
results establish foundational guidelines for prompt engineering in
computational pathology and highlight the potential of VLMs to enhance
diagnostic accuracy when properly instructed with domain-appropriate prompts.

Abstract: The rising popularity of immersive visual experiences has increased interest
in stereoscopic 3D video generation. Despite significant advances in video
synthesis, creating 3D videos remains challenging due to the relative scarcity
of 3D video data. We propose a simple approach for transforming a text-to-video
generator into a video-to-stereo generator. Given an input video, our framework
automatically produces the video frames from a shifted viewpoint, enabling a
compelling 3D effect. Prior and concurrent approaches for this task typically
operate in multiple phases, first estimating video disparity or depth, then
warping the video accordingly to produce a second view, and finally inpainting
the disoccluded regions. This approach inherently fails when the scene involves
specular surfaces or transparent objects. In such cases, single-layer disparity
estimation is insufficient, resulting in artifacts and incorrect pixel shifts
during warping. Our work bypasses these restrictions by directly synthesizing
the new viewpoint, avoiding any intermediate steps. This is achieved by
leveraging a pre-trained video model's priors on geometry, object materials,
optics, and semantics, without relying on external geometry models or manually
disentangling geometry from the synthesis process. We demonstrate the
advantages of our approach in complex, real-world scenarios featuring diverse
object materials and compositions. See videos on

Abstract: The rapid evolution of social media has provided enhanced communication
channels for individuals to create online content, enabling them to express
their thoughts and opinions. Multimodal memes, often utilized for playful or
humorous expressions with visual and textual elements, are sometimes misused to
disseminate hate speech against individuals or groups. While the detection of
hateful memes is well-researched, developing effective methods to transform
hateful content in memes remains a significant challenge. Leveraging the
powerful generation and reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), we address the tasks of detecting and mitigating hateful content. This
paper presents two key contributions: first, a definition-guided prompting
technique for detecting hateful memes, and second, a unified framework for
mitigating hateful content in memes, named UnHateMeme, which works by replacing
hateful textual and/or visual components. With our definition-guided prompts,
VLMs achieve impressive performance on hateful memes detection task.
Furthermore, our UnHateMeme framework, integrated with VLMs, demonstrates a
strong capability to convert hateful memes into non-hateful forms that meet
human-level criteria for hate speech and maintain multimodal coherence between
image and text. Through empirical experiments, we show the effectiveness of
state-of-the-art pretrained VLMs such as LLaVA, Gemini and GPT-4o on the
proposed tasks, providing a comprehensive analysis of their respective
strengths and limitations for these tasks. This paper aims to shed light on
important applications of VLMs for ensuring safe and respectful online
environments.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong capabilities in

performance without requiring fine-tuning. Through a dedicated preprocessing
pipeline that extracts 3D object data, our method improves situational
awareness and decision-making in complex traffic scenarios, achieving a score
of 0.56 on the LingoQA benchmark. We further explore different fusion
strategies and token combinations with the goal of advancing the interpretation
of traffic scenes, ultimately enabling safer autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: A current limitation of video generative video models is that they generate
plausible looking frames, but poor motion -- an issue that is not well captured
by FVD and other popular methods for evaluating generated videos. Here we go
beyond FVD by developing a metric which better measures plausible object
interactions and motion. Our novel approach is based on auto-encoding point
tracks and yields motion features that can be used to not only compare
distributions of videos (as few as one generated and one ground truth, or as
many as two datasets), but also for evaluating motion of single videos. We show
that using point tracks instead of pixel reconstruction or action recognition
features results in a metric which is markedly more sensitive to temporal
distortions in synthetic data, and can predict human evaluations of temporal
consistency and realism in generated videos obtained from open-source models
better than a wide range of alternatives. We also show that by using a point
track representation, we can spatiotemporally localize generative video
inconsistencies, providing extra interpretability of generated video errors
relative to prior work. An overview of the results and link to the code can be

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) enables applications in holographic
augmented reality (AR), 3D displays, systems neuroscience, and optical
trapping. The fundamental challenge in CGH is solving the inverse problem of
phase retrieval from intensity measurements. Physics-inspired neural networks
(PINNs), especially Gerchberg-Saxton-based PINNs (GS-PINNs), have advanced
phase retrieval capabilities. However, their performance strongly depends on
forward models (FMs) and their hyperparameters (FMHs), limiting generalization,
complicating benchmarking, and hindering hardware optimization. We present a
systematic sensitivity analysis framework based on Saltelli's extension of
Sobol's method to quantify FMH impacts on GS-PINN performance. Our analysis
demonstrates that SLM pixel-resolution is the primary factor affecting neural
network sensitivity, followed by pixel-pitch, propagation distance, and
wavelength. Free space propagation forward models demonstrate superior neural
network performance compared to Fourier holography, providing enhanced
parameterization and generalization. We introduce a composite evaluation metric
combining performance consistency, generalization capability, and
hyperparameter perturbation resilience, establishing a unified benchmarking
standard across CGH configurations. Our research connects physics-inspired deep
learning theory with practical CGH implementations through concrete guidelines
for forward model selection, neural network architecture, and performance
evaluation. Our contributions advance the development of robust, interpretable,
and generalizable neural networks for diverse holographic applications,
supporting evidence-based decisions in CGH research and implementation.

Conclusion: AVA在开放视频分析中表现优异，为超长视频处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: AI-driven video analytics has become increasingly pivotal across diverse
domains. However, existing systems are often constrained to specific,
predefined tasks, limiting their adaptability in open-ended analytical
scenarios. The recent emergence of Video-Language Models (VLMs) as
transformative technologies offers significant potential for enabling
open-ended video understanding, reasoning, and analytics. Nevertheless, their
limited context windows present challenges when processing ultra-long video
content, which is prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we
introduce AVA, a VLM-powered system designed for open-ended, advanced video
analytics. AVA incorporates two key innovations: (1) the near real-time
construction of Event Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) for efficient indexing of long or
continuous video streams, and (2) an agentic retrieval-generation mechanism
that leverages EKGs to handle complex and diverse queries. Comprehensive
evaluations on public benchmarks, LVBench and VideoMME-Long, demonstrate that
AVA achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 62.3% and 64.1% accuracy,
respectively, significantly surpassing existing VLM and video
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Furthermore, to evaluate video
analytics in ultra-long and open-world video scenarios, we introduce a new
benchmark, AVA-100. This benchmark comprises 8 videos, each exceeding 10 hours
in duration, along with 120 manually annotated, diverse, and complex
question-answer pairs. On AVA-100, AVA achieves top-tier performance with an
accuracy of 75.8%.

Result: 在2D图像和3D点云分类任务上的实验表明，该方法优于现有后训练量化方法。

Conclusion: Pack-PTQ通过保留跨块依赖性和自适应混合精度量化，显著提升了低比特量化性能。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has evolved as a prominent solution for
compressing complex models, which advocates a small calibration dataset and
avoids end-to-end retraining. However, most existing PTQ methods employ
block-wise reconstruction, which neglects cross-block dependency and exhibits a
notable accuracy drop in low-bit cases. To address these limitations, this
paper presents a novel PTQ method, dubbed Pack-PTQ. First, we design a
Hessian-guided adaptive packing mechanism to partition blocks into
non-overlapping packs, which serve as the base unit for reconstruction, thereby
preserving the cross-block dependency and enabling accurate quantization
parameters estimation. Second, based on the pack configuration, we propose a
mixed-precision quantization approach to assign varied bit-widths to packs
according to their distinct sensitivities, thereby further enhancing
performance. Extensive experiments on 2D image and 3D point cloud
classification tasks, using various network architectures, demonstrate the
superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art PTQ methods.

Method: 使用806个标注的结核病监控视频数据集，训练模型检测依从性模式，结合视觉特征与医学概念。

Result: 模型在多个配置下性能提升3.1%至3.54%，并通过消融实验验证了有效性。

Conclusion: AdCare-VLM在药物依从性监测中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Chronic diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, asthma, HIV-AIDS,
epilepsy, and tuberculosis, necessitate rigorous adherence to medication to
avert disease progression, manage symptoms, and decrease mortality rates.
Adherence is frequently undermined by factors including patient behavior,
caregiver support, elevated medical costs, and insufficient healthcare
infrastructure. We propose AdCare-VLM, a specialized Video-LLaVA-based
multimodal large vision language model (LVLM) aimed at visual question
answering (VQA) concerning medication adherence through patient videos. We
employ a private dataset comprising 806 custom-annotated tuberculosis (TB)
medication monitoring videos, which have been labeled by clinical experts, to
fine-tune the model for adherence pattern detection. We present LLM-TB-VQA, a
detailed medical adherence VQA dataset that encompasses positive, negative, and
ambiguous adherence cases. Our method identifies correlations between visual
features, such as the clear visibility of the patient's face, medication, water
intake, and the act of ingestion, and their associated medical concepts in
captions. This facilitates the integration of aligned visual-linguistic
representations and improves multimodal interactions. Experimental results
indicate that our method surpasses parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
enabled VLM models, such as LLaVA-V1.5 and Chat-UniVi, with absolute
improvements ranging from 3.1% to 3.54% across pre-trained, regular, and
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) configurations. Comprehensive ablation studies and
attention map visualizations substantiate our approach, enhancing
interpretability.

*Xinlong Zhao,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于气体泄漏分割的细粒度时空感知算法（FGSTP），通过捕捉帧间运动线索并结合对象特征，显著提升了分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气体泄漏因其隐蔽性和随机形状难以高效准确检测，现有方法有限。

Method: FGSTP算法通过构建相关体积捕捉帧间运动信息，逐步细化对象特征，并使用解码器优化边界分割。

Result: 在自标注数据集GasVid上，FGSTP表现优于其他SOTA模型，生成最精确的掩码。

Conclusion: FGSTP为气体泄漏分割提供了高效解决方案，尤其在非刚性物体上表现突出。

Abstract: Gas leaks pose significant risks to human health and the environment. Despite
long-standing concerns, there are limited methods that can efficiently and
accurately detect and segment leaks due to their concealed appearance and
random shapes. In this paper, we propose a Fine-grained Spatial-Temporal
Perception (FGSTP) algorithm for gas leak segmentation. FGSTP captures critical
motion clues across frames and integrates them with refined object features in
an end-to-end network. Specifically, we first construct a correlation volume to
capture motion information between consecutive frames. Then, the fine-grained
perception progressively refines the object-level features using previous
outputs. Finally, a decoder is employed to optimize boundary segmentation.
Because there is no highly precise labeled dataset for gas leak segmentation,
we manually label a gas leak video dataset, GasVid. Experimental results on
GasVid demonstrate that our model excels in segmenting non-rigid objects such
as gas leaks, generating the most accurate mask compared to other
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的自动轮廓质量评估方法，利用贝叶斯序数分类和校准不确定性阈值，无需依赖真实轮廓或大量手动标注即可实现高质量预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线自适应放疗（OART）中，自动轮廓的质量评估对临床决策至关重要，但传统方法依赖真实轮廓或大量手动标注，效率低下。

Method: 开发了贝叶斯序数分类模型，通过校准不确定性阈值优化预测准确性，并在无标注、少量标注和大量标注三种数据场景下验证。

Result: 模型在所有场景下表现稳健，仅需30个手动标注即可达到90%以上准确率，校准后预测准确率超过93%，显著减少手动审核需求。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了OART中轮廓评估的效率，通过不确定性量化确保放疗工作流更安全可靠。

Abstract: Purpose: This study presents a Deep Learning (DL)-based quality assessment
(QA) approach for evaluating auto-generated contours (auto-contours) in
radiotherapy, with emphasis on Online Adaptive Radiotherapy (OART). Leveraging
Bayesian Ordinal Classification (BOC) and calibrated uncertainty thresholds,
the method enables confident QA predictions without relying on ground truth
contours or extensive manual labeling. Methods: We developed a BOC model to
classify auto-contour quality and quantify prediction uncertainty. A
calibration step was used to optimize uncertainty thresholds that meet clinical
accuracy needs. The method was validated under three data scenarios: no manual
labels, limited labels, and extensive labels. For rectum contours in prostate
cancer, we applied geometric surrogate labels when manual labels were absent,
transfer learning when limited, and direct supervision when ample labels were
available. Results: The BOC model delivered robust performance across all
scenarios. Fine-tuning with just 30 manual labels and calibrating with 34
subjects yielded over 90% accuracy on test data. Using the calibrated
threshold, over 93% of the auto-contours' qualities were accurately predicted
in over 98% of cases, reducing unnecessary manual reviews and highlighting
cases needing correction. Conclusion: The proposed QA model enhances contouring
efficiency in OART by reducing manual workload and enabling fast, informed
clinical decisions. Through uncertainty quantification, it ensures safer, more
reliable radiotherapy workflows.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的两层集成框架用于深度伪造检测，通过结合多种深度学习架构和动态权重机制，实现了高准确性和跨数据集泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于合成媒体的兴起对数字身份和网络安全构成威胁，深度伪造检测的需求日益增长。现有方法在多样数据集和操纵类型上表现不一致，需要更稳健的解决方案。

Method: 采用Xception、Res2Net101和EfficientNet-B7三种架构的多个实例，通过两层集成框架：第一层减少模型方差，第二层通过反向传播学习动态权重。

Result: 在FF++和CelebDF-v2数据集上分别达到99.22%和100.00%的AUC分数，F1分数分别为98.06%和99.94%。跨数据集泛化表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架在深度伪造检测中表现出色，具有高准确性和泛化能力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Deepfake detection has become increasingly important due to the rise of
synthetic media, which poses significant risks to digital identity and cyber
presence for security and trust. While multiple approaches have improved
detection accuracy, challenges remain in achieving consistent performance
across diverse datasets and manipulation types. In response, we propose a novel
two-tier ensemble framework for deepfake detection based on deep learning that
hierarchically combines multiple instances of three state-of-the-art
architectures: Xception, Res2Net101, and EfficientNet-B7. Our framework employs
a unique approach where each architecture is instantiated three times with
different initializations to enhance model diversity, followed by a learnable
weighting mechanism that dynamically combines their predictions. Unlike
traditional fixed-weight ensembles, our first-tier averages predictions within
each architecture family to reduce model variance, while the second tier learns
optimal contribution weights through backpropagation, automatically adjusting
each architecture's influence based on their detection reliability. Our
experiments achieved state-of-the-art intra-dataset performance with AUC scores
of 99.22% (FF++) and 100.00% (CelebDF-v2), and F1 scores of 98.06% (FF++) and
99.94% (CelebDF-v2) without augmentation. With augmentation, we achieve AUC
scores of 99.47% (FF++) and 100.00% (CelebDF-v2), and F1 scores of 98.43%
(FF++) and 99.95% (CelebDF-v2). The framework demonstrates robust cross-dataset
generalization, achieving AUC scores of 88.20% and 72.52%, and F1 scores of
93.16% and 80.62% in cross-dataset evaluations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ResQu的新型图像超分辨率框架，结合四元数小波预处理和潜在扩散模型，通过动态集成小波嵌入提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像超分辨率在计算机视觉中应用广泛，但现有方法在高倍放大时难以平衡感知质量和结构保真度。

Method: 集成四元数小波预处理与潜在扩散模型，引入时间感知编码器，动态集成小波嵌入于去噪过程。

Result: 在领域特定数据集上表现优异，超越现有方法，感知质量和评价指标均有提升。

Conclusion: ResQu框架通过创新方法解决了高倍放大的挑战，代码将在修订后公开。

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution is a fundamental problem in computer vision with broad
applications spacing from medical imaging to satellite analysis. The ability to
reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs is crucial for
enhancing downstream tasks such as object detection and segmentation. While
deep learning has significantly advanced SR, achieving high-quality
reconstructions with fine-grained details and realistic textures remains
challenging, particularly at high upscaling factors. Recent approaches
leveraging diffusion models have demonstrated promising results, yet they often
struggle to balance perceptual quality with structural fidelity. In this work,
we introduce ResQu a novel SR framework that integrates a quaternion wavelet
preprocessing framework with latent diffusion models, incorporating a new
quaternion wavelet- and time-aware encoder. Unlike prior methods that simply
apply wavelet transforms within diffusion models, our approach enhances the
conditioning process by exploiting quaternion wavelet embeddings, which are
dynamically integrated at different stages of denoising. Furthermore, we also
leverage the generative priors of foundation models such as Stable Diffusion.
Extensive experiments on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that our method
achieves outstanding SR results, outperforming in many cases existing
approaches in perceptual quality and standard evaluation metrics. The code will
be available after the revision process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网格型参数编码方法在视频应用中存在参数冗余和低效问题，NVTM旨在解决这些问题，同时提升视频表示的质量和效率。

Method: NVTM将时空3D视频数据分解为带有流信息的2D网格，支持快速学习和高效参数利用，同时处理时间相关像素。

Result: NVTM在编码速度上比NeRV快3倍，PSNR/LPIPS指标显著提升，且在压缩任务中表现接近H.264和HEVC标准。

Conclusion: NVTM在视频表示和压缩任务中表现出色，适用于超分辨率、帧插值和视频修复等多种应用。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INR) has found successful applications
across diverse domains. To employ INR in real-life, it is important to speed up
training. In the field of INR for video applications, the state-of-the-art
approach employs grid-type parametric encoding and successfully achieves a
faster encoding speed in comparison to its predecessors. However, the grid
usage, which does not consider the video's dynamic nature, leads to redundant
use of trainable parameters. As a result, it has significantly lower parameter
efficiency and higher bitrate compared to NeRV-style methods that do not use a
parametric encoding. To address the problem, we propose Neural Video
representation with Temporally coherent Modulation (NVTM), a novel framework
that can capture dynamic characteristics of video. By decomposing the
spatio-temporal 3D video data into a set of 2D grids with flow information,
NVTM enables learning video representation rapidly and uses parameter
efficiently. Our framework enables to process temporally corresponding pixels
at once, resulting in the fastest encoding speed for a reasonable video
quality, especially when compared to the NeRV-style method, with a speed
increase of over 3 times. Also, it remarks an average of 1.54dB/0.019
improvements in PSNR/LPIPS on UVG (Dynamic) (even with 10% fewer parameters)
and an average of 1.84dB/0.013 improvements in PSNR/LPIPS on MCL-JCV (Dynamic),
compared to previous grid-type works. By expanding this to compression tasks,
we demonstrate comparable performance to video compression standards (H.264,
HEVC) and recent INR approaches for video compression. Additionally, we perform
extensive experiments demonstrating the superior performance of our algorithm
across diverse tasks, encompassing super resolution, frame interpolation and
video inpainting. Project page is https://sujiikim.github.io/NVTM/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经母细胞瘤手术规划依赖耗时且依赖用户的MRI 3D模型，需开发自动分割方法。

Method: 组织SPPIN挑战赛，提供多模态MRI数据，基于Dice分数、HD95和VS评估团队表现。

Result: 最佳团队Dice分数0.82，HD95 7.69 mm，VS 0.91，但小肿瘤分割效果差（Dice 0.59）。

Conclusion: 预训练网络在小数据集有效，但需更可靠方法以支持临床手术规划。

Abstract: Surgery plays an important role within the treatment for neuroblastoma, a
common pediatric cancer. This requires careful planning, often via magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI)-based anatomical 3D models. However, creating these
models is often time-consuming and user dependent. We organized the Surgical
Planning in Pediatric Neuroblastoma (SPPIN) challenge, to stimulate
developments on this topic, and set a benchmark for fully automatic
segmentation of neuroblastoma on multi-model MRI. The challenge started with a
training phase, where teams received 78 sets of MRI scans from 34 patients,
consisting of both diagnostic and post-chemotherapy MRI scans. The final test
phase, consisting of 18 MRI sets from 9 patients, determined the ranking of the
teams. Ranking was based on the Dice similarity coefficient (Dice score), the
95th percentile of the Hausdorff distance (HD95) and the volumetric similarity
(VS). The SPPIN challenge was hosted at MICCAI 2023. The final leaderboard
consisted of 9 teams. The highest-ranking team achieved a median Dice score
0.82, a median HD95 of 7.69 mm and a VS of 0.91, utilizing a large, pretrained
network called STU-Net. A significant difference for the segmentation results
between diagnostic and post-chemotherapy MRI scans was observed (Dice = 0.89 vs
Dice = 0.59, P = 0.01) for the highest-ranking team. SPPIN is the first medical
segmentation challenge in extracranial pediatric oncology. The highest-ranking
team used a large pre-trained network, suggesting that pretraining can be of
use in small, heterogenous datasets. Although the results of the
highest-ranking team were high for most patients, segmentation especially in
small, pre-treated tumors were insufficient. Therefore, more reliable
segmentation methods are needed to create clinically applicable models to aid
surgical planning in pediatric neuroblastoma.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖高保真3D点云或跨视图关联，而Cues3D利用NeRF的隐式几何一致性，避免复杂预处理。

Method: 提出三阶段训练框架（初始化-消歧-细化），结合实例消歧方法，确保3D实例ID的全局唯一性。

Result: 在多个数据集上优于2D图像方法，与最新2D-3D融合方法竞争，甚至在使用额外3D点云时超越它们。

Conclusion: Cues3D通过NeRF的隐式几何一致性，高效实现3D实例分割，无需复杂跨视图关联。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D panoptic segmentation has recently emerged as a
significant trend. Top-performing methods currently integrate 2D segmentation
with geometry-aware 3D primitives. However, the advantage would be lost without
high-fidelity 3D point clouds, such as methods based on Neural Radiance Field
(NeRF). These methods are limited by the insufficient capacity to maintain
consistency across partial observations. To address this, recent works have
utilized contrastive loss or cross-view association pre-processing for view
consensus. In contrast to them, we present Cues3D, a compact approach that
relies solely on NeRF instead of pre-associations. The core idea is that NeRF's
implicit 3D field inherently establishes a globally consistent geometry,
enabling effective object distinction without explicit cross-view supervision.
We propose a three-phase training framework for NeRF,
initialization-disambiguation-refinement, whereby the instance IDs are
corrected using the initially-learned knowledge. Additionally, an instance
disambiguation method is proposed to match NeRF-rendered 3D masks and ensure
globally unique 3D instance identities. With the aid of Cues3D, we obtain
highly consistent and unique 3D instance ID for each object across views with a
balanced version of NeRF. Our experiments are conducted on ScanNet v2,
ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and Replica datasets for 3D instance, panoptic, and
semantic segmentation tasks. Cues3D outperforms other 2D image-based methods
and competes with the latest 2D-3D merging based methods, while even surpassing
them when using additional 3D point clouds. The code link could be found in the
appendix and will be released on

Method: 通过全面评估NIR-VIS跨光谱系统的脆弱性。

Result: 实证表明系统虽可靠，但对特定攻击仍脆弱。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究以提高系统安全性。

Abstract: Cross-spectral face recognition systems are designed to enhance the
performance of facial recognition systems by enabling cross-modal matching
under challenging operational conditions. A particularly relevant application
is the matching of near-infrared (NIR) images to visible-spectrum (VIS) images,
enabling the verification of individuals by comparing NIR facial captures
acquired with VIS reference images. The use of NIR imaging offers several
advantages, including greater robustness to illumination variations, better
visibility through glasses and glare, and greater resistance to presentation
attacks. Despite these claimed benefits, the robustness of NIR-based systems
against presentation attacks has not been systematically studied in the
literature. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation into the
vulnerability of NIR-VIS cross-spectral face recognition systems to
presentation attacks. Our empirical findings indicate that, although these
systems exhibit a certain degree of reliability, they remain vulnerable to
specific attacks, emphasizing the need for further research in this area.

Method: 提出SOTA框架，包含Spike-based Micro-debias (SM)和Spike-based Global-debias (SG)，分别处理帧间细微变化和全局不一致性。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上，SOTA显著优于现有方法，有效消除复合噪声偏差。

Conclusion: SOTA通过结合脉冲相机优势并解决偏差问题，显著提升了显著性检测的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Existing saliency detection methods struggle in real-world scenarios due to
motion blur and occlusions. In contrast, spike cameras, with their high
temporal resolution, significantly enhance visual saliency maps. However, the
composite noise inherent to spike camera imaging introduces discontinuities in
saliency detection. Low-quality samples further distort model predictions,
leading to saliency bias. To address these challenges, we propose
Spike-navigated Optimal TrAnsport Saliency Region Detection (SOTA), a framework
that leverages the strengths of spike cameras while mitigating biases in both
spatial and temporal dimensions. Our method introduces Spike-based Micro-debias
(SM) to capture subtle frame-to-frame variations and preserve critical details,
even under minimal scene or lighting changes. Additionally, Spike-based
Global-debias (SG) refines predictions by reducing inconsistencies across
diverse conditions. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets
demonstrate that SOTA outperforms existing methods by eliminating composite
noise bias. Our code and dataset will be released at

Abstract: High-quality, animatable 3D human avatar reconstruction from monocular videos
offers significant potential for reducing reliance on complex hardware, making
it highly practical for applications in game development, augmented reality,
and social media. However, existing methods still face substantial challenges
in capturing fine geometric details and maintaining animation stability,
particularly under dynamic or complex poses. To address these issues, we
propose a novel real-time framework for animatable human avatar reconstruction
based on 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS). By leveraging 2DGS and global SMPL pose
parameters, our framework not only aligns positional and rotational
discrepancies but also enables robust and natural pose-driven animation of the
reconstructed avatars. Furthermore, we introduce a Rotation Compensation
Network (RCN) that learns rotation residuals by integrating local geometric
features with global pose parameters. This network significantly improves the
handling of non-rigid deformations and ensures smooth, artifact-free pose
transitions during animation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
successfully reconstructs realistic and highly animatable human avatars from
monocular videos, effectively preserving fine-grained details while ensuring
stable and natural pose variation. Our approach surpasses current
state-of-the-art methods in both reconstruction quality and animation
robustness on public benchmarks.

Abstract: 3D part assembly aims to understand part relationships and predict their
6-DoF poses to construct realistic 3D shapes, addressing the growing demand for
autonomous assembly, which is crucial for robots. Existing methods mainly
estimate the transformation of each part by training neural networks under
supervision, which requires a substantial quantity of manually labeled data.
However, the high cost of data collection and the immense variability of
real-world shapes and parts make traditional methods impractical for
large-scale applications. In this paper, we propose first a zero-shot part
assembly method that utilizes pre-trained point cloud diffusion models as
discriminators in the assembly process, guiding the manipulation of parts to
form realistic shapes. Specifically, we theoretically demonstrate that
utilizing a diffusion model for zero-shot part assembly can be transformed into
an Iterative Closest Point (ICP) process. Then, we propose a novel pushing-away
strategy to address the overlap parts, thereby further enhancing the robustness
of the method. To verify our work, we conduct extensive experiments and
quantitative comparisons to several strong baseline methods, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the proposed approach, which even surpasses the supervised
learning method. The code has been released on

Abstract: We present JointDiT, a diffusion transformer that models the joint
distribution of RGB and depth. By leveraging the architectural benefit and
outstanding image prior of the state-of-the-art diffusion transformer, JointDiT
not only generates high-fidelity images but also produces geometrically
plausible and accurate depth maps. This solid joint distribution modeling is
achieved through two simple yet effective techniques that we propose, i.e.,
adaptive scheduling weights, which depend on the noise levels of each modality,
and the unbalanced timestep sampling strategy. With these techniques, we train
our model across all noise levels for each modality, enabling JointDiT to
naturally handle various combinatorial generation tasks, including joint
generation, depth estimation, and depth-conditioned image generation by simply
controlling the timestep of each branch. JointDiT demonstrates outstanding
joint generation performance. Furthermore, it achieves comparable results in
depth estimation and depth-conditioned image generation, suggesting that joint

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有唇同步方法常忽视表情泄漏和面部遮挡问题，影响实际应用（如自动配音）。KeySync旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用两阶段框架，结合掩码策略处理表情泄漏和遮挡，并通过LipLeak指标评估泄漏情况。

Result: KeySync在唇部重建和交叉同步中表现优异，视觉质量提升且表情泄漏减少。

Conclusion: KeySync通过新颖的掩码策略和两阶段设计，显著提升了唇同步任务的性能，解决了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Lip synchronization, known as the task of aligning lip movements in an
existing video with new input audio, is typically framed as a simpler variant
of audio-driven facial animation. However, as well as suffering from the usual
issues in talking head generation (e.g., temporal consistency), lip
synchronization presents significant new challenges such as expression leakage
from the input video and facial occlusions, which can severely impact
real-world applications like automated dubbing, but are often neglected in
existing works. To address these shortcomings, we present KeySync, a two-stage
framework that succeeds in solving the issue of temporal consistency, while
also incorporating solutions for leakage and occlusions using a carefully
designed masking strategy. We show that KeySync achieves state-of-the-art
results in lip reconstruction and cross-synchronization, improving visual
quality and reducing expression leakage according to LipLeak, our novel leakage
metric. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our new masking
approach in handling occlusions and validate our architectural choices through
several ablation studies. Code and model weights can be found at

TL;DR: 论文提出了HATIE基准，用于自动化评估文本引导的图像编辑模型，解决了现有方法依赖人工评估的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于文本引导图像编辑任务的主观性，缺乏标准评估方法，研究者依赖人工评估。

Method: 提出HATIE基准，包含大规模数据集和自动化评估流程，结合多维度评分以对齐人类感知。

Result: 验证HATIE评估与人类感知一致，并提供了多个先进模型的基准结果。

Conclusion: HATIE为文本引导图像编辑提供了可靠且自动化的评估标准。

Abstract: A variety of text-guided image editing models have been proposed recently.
However, there is no widely-accepted standard evaluation method mainly due to
the subjective nature of the task, letting researchers rely on manual user
study. To address this, we introduce a novel Human-Aligned benchmark for
Text-guided Image Editing (HATIE). Providing a large-scale benchmark set
covering a wide range of editing tasks, it allows reliable evaluation, not
limited to specific easy-to-evaluate cases. Also, HATIE provides a
fully-automated and omnidirectional evaluation pipeline. Particularly, we
combine multiple scores measuring various aspects of editing so as to align
with human perception. We empirically verify that the evaluation of HATIE is
indeed human-aligned in various aspects, and provide benchmark results on
several state-of-the-art models to provide deeper insights on their
performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HeAL（启发式增强的主动学习）通过结合启发式特征（如物体距离和点数量）与定位和分类，为3D目标检测模型选择最具贡献的训练样本，显著减少所需样本量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主动学习在自动驾驶模型训练中具有重要作用，但现有方法忽视实际应用中的启发式特征，导致样本选择在非受控场景中效果不佳。

Method: 提出HeAL方法，整合启发式特征（如物体距离和点数量）与定位和分类，以估计样本不确定性并优化选择。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，HeAL的mAP与全监督基线相当，仅需24%的样本量。

Conclusion: HeAL通过结合启发式特征，显著提升了主动学习在3D目标检测中的效率，为实际应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Active Learning has proved to be a relevant approach to perform sample
selection for training models for Autonomous Driving. Particularly, previous
works on active learning for 3D object detection have shown that selection of
samples in uncontrolled scenarios is challenging. Furthermore, current
approaches focus exclusively on the theoretical aspects of the sample selection
problem but neglect the practical insights that can be obtained from the
extensive literature and application of 3D detection models. In this paper, we
introduce HeAL (Heuristical-enhanced Active Learning for 3D Object Detection)
which integrates those heuristical features together with Localization and
Classification to deliver the most contributing samples to the model's
training. In contrast to previous works, our approach integrates heuristical
features such as object distance and point-quantity to estimate the
uncertainty, which enhance the usefulness of selected samples to train
detection models. Our quantitative evaluation on KITTI shows that HeAL presents
competitive mAP with respect to the State-of-the-Art, and achieves the same mAP
as the full-supervised baseline with only 24% of the samples.

Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在自动驾驶目标检测中表现优异，但需要大量标注数据，成本高昂。主动学习是一种优化数据标注过程的潜在方法。

Method: 扩展主动学习至LiDAR领域，开发基于不一致性的样本选择策略，并在不同设置下评估其效果。

Result: 使用基于检测框数量的简单不一致性方法，仅需50%标注数据即可达到随机采样的mAP性能。

Conclusion: 主动学习在LiDAR领域具有潜力，可显著减少标注数据需求。

Abstract: Deep learning models for object detection in autonomous driving have recently
achieved impressive performance gains and are already being deployed in
vehicles worldwide. However, current models require increasingly large datasets
for training. Acquiring and labeling such data is costly, necessitating the
development of new strategies to optimize this process. Active learning is a
promising approach that has been extensively researched in the image domain. In
our work, we extend this concept to the LiDAR domain by developing several
inconsistency-based sample selection strategies and evaluate their
effectiveness in various settings. Our results show that using a naive
inconsistency approach based on the number of detected boxes, we achieve the
same mAP as the random sampling strategy with 50% of the labeled data.

Result: 在SemanticKITTI数据集上，平均定位误差1.9米，精度89%，召回率77%（5米容忍度）。

Conclusion: 该方法对分割错误具有鲁棒性，适用于实际场景，性能优于现有基线。

Abstract: Intersections are geometric and functional key points in every road network.
They offer strong landmarks to correct GNSS dropouts and anchor new sensor data
in up-to-date maps. Despite that importance, intersection detectors either
ignore the rich semantic information already computed onboard or depend on
scarce, hand-labeled intersection datasets. To close that gap, this paper
presents a LiDAR-based method for intersection detection that (i) fuses
semantic road segmentation with vehicle localization to detect intersection
candidates in a bird's eye view (BEV) representation and (ii) refines those
candidates by analyzing branch topology with a least squares formulation. To
evaluate our method, we introduce an automated benchmarking pipeline that pairs
detections with OpenStreetMap (OSM) intersection nodes using precise GNSS/INS
ground-truth poses. Tested on eight SemanticKITTI sequences, the approach
achieves a mean localization error of 1.9 m, 89% precision, and 77% recall at a
5 m tolerance, outperforming the latest learning-based baseline. Moreover, the
method is robust to segmentation errors higher than those of the benchmark
model, demonstrating its applicability in the real world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着网络摄像头数量的增加，智能交通系统中手动目标跟踪和多摄像头匹配面临巨大挑战，需要高效且经济的方法来解决。

Method: 采用Mask R-CNN进行目标检测，结合NMS选择目标对象，利用迁移学习进行重识别，并通过ResNet-152和Deep SORT实现特征提取和跟踪。

Result: 在AI City Challenge数据集上，框架的IDF1得分为0.8289，精确率和召回率分别为0.9026和0.8527。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在车辆跟踪中表现出色，能够有效应对遮挡、光照变化等挑战。

Abstract: Vision sensors are becoming more important in Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) for traffic monitoring, management, and optimization as the
number of network cameras continues to rise. However, manual object tracking
and matching across multiple non-overlapping cameras pose significant
challenges in city-scale urban traffic scenarios. These challenges include
handling diverse vehicle attributes, occlusions, illumination variations,
shadows, and varying video resolutions. To address these issues, we propose an
efficient and cost-effective deep learning-based framework for Multi-Object
Multi-Camera Tracking (MO-MCT). The proposed framework utilizes Mask R-CNN for
object detection and employs Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to select target
objects from overlapping detections. Transfer learning is employed for
re-identification, enabling the association and generation of vehicle tracklets
across multiple cameras. Moreover, we leverage appropriate loss functions and
distance measures to handle occlusion, illumination, and shadow challenges. The
final solution identification module performs feature extraction using
ResNet-152 coupled with Deep SORT based vehicle tracking. The proposed
framework is evaluated on the 5th AI City Challenge dataset (Track 3),
comprising 46 camera feeds. Among these 46 camera streams, 40 are used for
model training and validation, while the remaining six are utilized for model
testing. The proposed framework achieves competitive performance with an IDF1
score of 0.8289, and precision and recall scores of 0.9026 and 0.8527
respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness in robust and accurate vehicle
tracking.

Method: 评估了多种混合CNN-Transformer架构（如HGNetV2和Next-ViT-S）与YOLOv8和RT-DETR检测头的组合，并在三个X射线数据集（EDS、HiXray、PIDray）上进行了测试。

Result: YOLOv8在HiXray和PIDray数据集上表现优异，但在EDS数据集（存在域分布偏移）中，混合架构更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 混合CNN-Transformer架构在特定场景下表现更优，为未来研究提供了方向。代码和模型权重已开源。

Abstract: In the field of X-ray security applications, even the smallest details can
significantly impact outcomes. Objects that are heavily occluded or
intentionally concealed pose a great challenge for detection, whether by human
observation or through advanced technological applications. While certain Deep
Learning (DL) architectures demonstrate strong performance in processing local
information, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), others excel in
handling distant information, e.g., transformers. In X-ray security imaging the
literature has been dominated by the use of CNN-based methods, while the
integration of the two aforementioned leading architectures has not been
sufficiently explored. In this paper, various hybrid CNN-transformer
architectures are evaluated against a common CNN object detection baseline,
namely YOLOv8. In particular, a CNN (HGNetV2) and a hybrid CNN-transformer
(Next-ViT-S) backbone are combined with different CNN/transformer detection
heads (YOLOv8 and RT-DETR). The resulting architectures are comparatively
evaluated on three challenging public X-ray inspection datasets, namely EDS,
HiXray, and PIDray. Interestingly, while the YOLOv8 detector with its default
backbone (CSP-DarkNet53) is generally shown to be advantageous on the HiXray
and PIDray datasets, when a domain distribution shift is incorporated in the
X-ray images (as happens in the EDS datasets), hybrid CNN-transformer
architectures exhibit increased robustness. Detailed comparative evaluation
results, including object-level detection performance and object-size error
analysis, demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of each architectural
combination and suggest guidelines for future research. The source code and
network weights of the models employed in this study are available at

TL;DR: BM-MAE是一种针对多模态MRI数据的预训练策略，能够适应任何可用的模态组合，无需架构更改，显著提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态MRI数据在临床中常因采集问题或设计限制缺失部分模态，现有方法需为每种模态组合单独训练模型，资源消耗大且不实用。

Method: 提出BM-MAE，一种掩码图像建模预训练策略，预训练模型可适应任何模态组合，捕获模态内和模态间信息。

Result: BM-MAE在多个下游任务中优于或与基线方法竞争，且能高效重建缺失模态。

Conclusion: BM-MAE为多模态MRI数据提供了一种高效且灵活的预训练解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) constitutes the first line of
investigation for clinicians in the care of brain tumors, providing crucial
insights for surgery planning, treatment monitoring, and biomarker
identification. Pre-training on large datasets have been shown to help models
learn transferable representations and adapt with minimal labeled data. This
behavior is especially valuable in medical imaging, where annotations are often
scarce. However, applying this paradigm to multimodal medical data introduces a
challenge: most existing approaches assume that all imaging modalities are
available during both pre-training and fine-tuning. In practice, missing
modalities often occur due to acquisition issues, specialist unavailability, or
specific experimental designs on small in-house datasets. Consequently, a
common approach involves training a separate model for each desired modality
combination, making the process both resource-intensive and impractical for
clinical use. Therefore, we introduce BM-MAE, a masked image modeling
pre-training strategy tailored for multimodal MRI data. The same pre-trained
model seamlessly adapts to any combination of available modalities, extracting
rich representations that capture both intra- and inter-modal information. This
allows fine-tuning on any subset of modalities without requiring architectural
changes, while still benefiting from a model pre-trained on the full set of
modalities. Extensive experiments show that the proposed pre-training strategy
outperforms or remains competitive with baselines that require separate
pre-training for each modality subset, while substantially surpassing training
from scratch on several downstream tasks. Additionally, it can quickly and
efficiently reconstruct missing modalities, highlighting its practical value.

Result: 在Animal Kingdom数据集上表现优于现有方法，能准确识别精细时序动作。

Conclusion: AnimalMotionCLIP有效解决了动物行为识别的关键挑战，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of interest in applying deep learning
techniques to animal behavior recognition, particularly leveraging pre-trained
visual language models, such as CLIP, due to their remarkable generalization
capacity across various downstream tasks. However, adapting these models to the
specific domain of animal behavior recognition presents two significant
challenges: integrating motion information and devising an effective temporal
modeling scheme. In this paper, we propose AnimalMotionCLIP to address these
challenges by interleaving video frames and optical flow information in the
CLIP framework. Additionally, several temporal modeling schemes using an
aggregation of classifiers are proposed and compared: dense, semi dense, and
sparse. As a result, fine temporal actions can be correctly recognized, which
is of vital importance in animal behavior analysis. Experiments on the Animal
Kingdom dataset demonstrate that AnimalMotionCLIP achieves superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

real-world interferences. We also present our results of a baseline lightweight
Noise Recognition neural network trained and tested on our augmented dataset,
reaching an overall recognition accuracy of 54.4\% on 11 categories across
10086 images and 2145 radar point-clouds.

Abstract: Automatic disease image grading is a significant application of artificial
intelligence for healthcare, enabling faster and more accurate patient
assessments. However, domain shifts, which are exacerbated by data imbalance,
introduce bias into the model, posing deployment difficulties in clinical
applications. To address the problem, we propose a novel
\textbf{U}ncertainty-aware \textbf{M}ulti-experts \textbf{K}nowledge
\textbf{D}istillation (UMKD) framework to transfer knowledge from multiple
expert models to a single student model. Specifically, to extract
discriminative features, UMKD decouples task-agnostic and task-specific
features with shallow and compact feature alignment in the feature space. At
the output space, an uncertainty-aware decoupled distillation (UDD) mechanism
dynamically adjusts knowledge transfer weights based on expert model
uncertainties, ensuring robust and reliable distillation. Additionally, UMKD
also tackles the problems of model architecture heterogeneity and distribution
discrepancies between source and target domains, which are inadequately tackled
by previous KD approaches. Extensive experiments on histology prostate grading
(\textit{SICAPv2}) and fundus image grading (\textit{APTOS}) demonstrate that
UMKD achieves a new state-of-the-art in both source-imbalanced and
target-imbalanced scenarios, offering a robust and practical solution for
real-world disease image grading.

Abstract: The future of inland navigation increasingly relies on autonomous systems and
remote operations, emphasizing the need for accurate vessel trajectory
prediction. This study addresses the challenges of video-based vessel tracking
and prediction by integrating advanced object detection methods, Kalman
filters, and spline-based interpolation. However, existing detection systems
often misclassify objects in inland waterways due to complex surroundings. A
comparative evaluation of tracking algorithms, including BoT-SORT, Deep
OC-SORT, and ByeTrack, highlights the robustness of the Kalman filter in
providing smoothed trajectories. Experimental results from diverse scenarios
demonstrate improved accuracy in predicting vessel movements, which is
essential for collision avoidance and situational awareness. The findings
underline the necessity of customized datasets and models for inland
navigation. Future work will expand the datasets and incorporate vessel
classification to refine predictions, supporting both autonomous systems and
human operators in complex environments.

Abstract: Monitoring dietary habits is crucial for preventing health risks associated
with overeating and undereating, including obesity, diabetes, and
cardiovascular diseases. Traditional methods for tracking food intake rely on
self-reported data before or after the eating, which are prone to inaccuracies.
This study proposes an approach to accurately monitor ingest behaviours by
leveraging 3D food models constructed from monocular 2D video. Using COLMAP and
pose estimation algorithms, we generate detailed 3D representations of food,
allowing us to observe changes in food volume as it is consumed. Experiments
with toy models and real food items demonstrate the approach's potential.
Meanwhile, we have proposed a new methodology for automated state recognition
challenges to accurately detect state changes and maintain model fidelity. The
3D reconstruction approach shows promise in capturing comprehensive dietary
behaviour insights, ultimately contributing to the development of automated and
accurate dietary monitoring tools.

Abstract: We address the 3D reconstruction of human faces from a single RGB image. To
this end, we propose Pixel3DMM, a set of highly-generalized vision transformers
which predict per-pixel geometric cues in order to constrain the optimization
of a 3D morphable face model (3DMM). We exploit the latent features of the DINO
foundation model, and introduce a tailored surface normal and uv-coordinate
prediction head. We train our model by registering three high-quality 3D face
datasets against the FLAME mesh topology, which results in a total of over
1,000 identities and 976K images. For 3D face reconstruction, we propose a
FLAME fitting opitmization that solves for the 3DMM parameters from the
uv-coordinate and normal estimates. To evaluate our method, we introduce a new
benchmark for single-image face reconstruction, which features high diversity
facial expressions, viewing angles, and ethnicities. Crucially, our benchmark
is the first to evaluate both posed and neutral facial geometry. Ultimately,
our method outperforms the most competitive baselines by over 15% in terms of
geometric accuracy for posed facial expressions.

Result: 在三个VI-ReID数据集上的实验证明了DSFAD的优越性。

Conclusion: DSFAD能有效对齐和解耦特征，提升行人重识别性能。

Abstract: Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification (VI-ReID) is a challenging task due
to the large modality discrepancy between visible and infrared images, which
complicates the alignment of their features into a suitable common space.
Moreover, style noise, such as illumination and color contrast, reduces the
identity discriminability and modality invariance of features. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Diverse Semantics-guided Feature Alignment and
Decoupling (DSFAD) network to align identity-relevant features from different
modalities into a textual embedding space and disentangle identity-irrelevant
features within each modality. Specifically, we develop a Diverse
Semantics-guided Feature Alignment (DSFA) module, which generates pedestrian
descriptions with diverse sentence structures to guide the cross-modality
alignment of visual features. Furthermore, to filter out style information, we
propose a Semantic Margin-guided Feature Decoupling (SMFD) module, which
decomposes visual features into pedestrian-related and style-related
components, and then constrains the similarity between the former and the
textual embeddings to be at least a margin higher than that between the latter
and the textual embeddings. Additionally, to prevent the loss of pedestrian
semantics during feature decoupling, we design a Semantic Consistency-guided
Feature Restitution (SCFR) module, which further excavates useful information
for identification from the style-related features and restores it back into

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑部疾病复杂且社会影响大，现有基础模型受限于任务和数据同质性，泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出SAM-Brain3D（基于14种MRI子模态的脑部基础模型）和HyDA（轻量级适配器），通过超图动态融合多模态数据。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种脑部疾病任务中优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该框架为脑部疾病分析提供了多模态、多尺度和动态建模的新范式。

Abstract: Brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and brain tumors, present
profound challenges due to their complexity and societal impact. Recent
advancements in brain foundation models have shown significant promise in
addressing a range of brain-related tasks. However, current brain foundation
models are limited by task and data homogeneity, restricted generalization
beyond segmentation or classification, and inefficient adaptation to diverse
clinical tasks. In this work, we propose SAM-Brain3D, a brain-specific
foundation model trained on over 66,000 brain image-label pairs across 14 MRI
sub-modalities, and Hypergraph Dynamic Adapter (HyDA), a lightweight adapter
for efficient and effective downstream adaptation. SAM-Brain3D captures
detailed brain-specific anatomical and modality priors for segmenting diverse
brain targets and broader downstream tasks. HyDA leverages hypergraphs to fuse
complementary multi-modal data and dynamically generate patient-specific
convolutional kernels for multi-scale feature fusion and personalized
patient-wise adaptation. Together, our framework excels across a broad spectrum
of brain disease segmentation and classification tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches, offering a new paradigm for brain disease analysis through
multi-modal, multi-scale, and dynamic foundation modeling.

Abstract: Deep learning has profoundly transformed remote sensing, yet prevailing
architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers
(ViTs) remain constrained by critical trade-offs: CNNs suffer from limited
receptive fields, while ViTs grapple with quadratic computational complexity,
hindering their scalability for high-resolution remote sensing data. State
Space Models (SSMs), particularly the recently proposed Mamba architecture,
have emerged as a paradigm-shifting solution, combining linear computational
scaling with global context modeling. This survey presents a comprehensive
review of Mamba-based methodologies in remote sensing, systematically analyzing
about 120 studies to construct a holistic taxonomy of innovations and
applications. Our contributions are structured across five dimensions: (i)
foundational principles of vision Mamba architectures, (ii) micro-architectural
advancements such as adaptive scan strategies and hybrid SSM formulations,
(iii) macro-architectural integrations, including CNN-Transformer-Mamba hybrids
and frequency-domain adaptations, (iv) rigorous benchmarking against
state-of-the-art methods in multiple application tasks, such as object
detection, semantic segmentation, change detection, etc. and (v) critical
analysis of unresolved challenges with actionable future directions. By
bridging the gap between SSM theory and remote sensing practice, this survey
establishes Mamba as a transformative framework for remote sensing analysis. To
our knowledge, this paper is the first systematic review of Mamba architectures
in remote sensing. Our work provides a structured foundation for advancing
research in remote sensing systems through SSM-based methods. We curate an
open-source repository

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度强化学习（DRL）的框架，用于优化德里市空气净化亭的布局，以改善空气质量指数（AQI）。通过使用PPO算法，该方法在动态城市环境中显著优于传统策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 德里是全球污染最严重的城市之一，传统静态空气净化设施因布局不合理和适应性差而效果有限。本文旨在通过AI优化布局，提升空气质量。

Method: 采用近端策略优化（PPO）算法，结合人口密度、交通模式等环境因素，动态学习并优化空气净化亭的布局。

Result: 实验表明，DRL框架在AQI改善、空间覆盖和公平性方面均优于随机和贪婪基线方法。

Conclusion: AI驱动的空间优化为智能城市和空气质量管理的未来发展提供了新思路。

Abstract: Urban air pollution remains a pressing global concern, particularly in
densely populated and traffic-intensive metropolitan areas like Delhi, where
exposure to harmful pollutants severely impacts public health. Delhi, being one
of the most polluted cities globally, experiences chronic air quality issues
due to vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and construction dust, which
exacerbate its already fragile atmospheric conditions. Traditional pollution
mitigation strategies, such as static air purifying installations, often fail
to maximize their impact due to suboptimal placement and limited adaptability
to dynamic urban environments. This study presents a novel deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) framework to optimize the placement of air purification booths
to improve the air quality index (AQI) in the city of Delhi. We employ Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm,
to iteratively learn and identify high-impact locations based on multiple
spatial and environmental factors, including population density, traffic
patterns, industrial influence, and green space constraints. Our approach is
benchmarked against conventional placement strategies, including random and
greedy AQI-based methods, using multi-dimensional performance evaluation
metrics such as AQI improvement, spatial coverage, population and traffic
impact, and spatial entropy. Experimental results demonstrate that the RL-based
approach outperforms baseline methods by achieving a balanced and effective
distribution of air purification infrastructure. Notably, the DRL framework
achieves an optimal trade-off between AQI reduction and high-coverage
deployment, ensuring equitable environmental benefits across urban regions. The
findings underscore the potential of AI-driven spatial optimization in
advancing smart city initiatives and data-driven urban air quality management.

Motivation: 网页的视觉复杂性和大量界面元素使得动作选择困难，需要一种方法减少背景干扰并提高准确性。

Method: 提出动态缩放相关区域的视觉测试时缩放方法，并结合图像地图机制可视化关键地标，提供透明动作记录。

Result: 在Screenspot-pro和WebVoyager基准测试中，性能分别提升28%和24%，并在ScreenSpot-Pro上达到61.6%的最新性能。

Conclusion: RegionFocus通过视觉测试时缩放显著提升了视觉语言模型代理的性能，适用于交互式场景。

Abstract: We introduce RegionFocus, a visual test-time scaling approach for Vision
Language Model Agents. Understanding webpages is challenging due to the visual
complexity of GUI images and the large number of interface elements, making
accurate action selection difficult. Our approach dynamically zooms in on
relevant regions, reducing background clutter and improving grounding accuracy.
To support this process, we propose an image-as-map mechanism that visualizes
key landmarks at each step, providing a transparent action record and enables
the agent to effectively choose among action candidates. Even with a simple
region selection strategy, we observe significant performance gains of 28+\% on
Screenspot-pro and 24+\% on WebVoyager benchmarks on top of two
state-of-the-art open vision language model agents, UI-TARS and Qwen2.5-VL,
highlighting the effectiveness of visual test-time scaling in interactive
settings. We achieve a new state-of-the-art grounding performance of 61.6\% on
the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark by applying RegionFocus to a Qwen2.5-VL-72B model.

Motivation: 当前微型交通工具依赖人工操作，存在安全和效率问题，需要AI辅助以应对复杂的城市环境。

Method: 构建URBAN-SIM平台（包含三个模块）和URBAN-BENCH评估套件（包含八项任务），评估四种机器人在不同任务中的表现。

Result: 实验揭示了不同机器人在多样地形和城市结构中的优势和局限性。

Conclusion: URBAN-SIM和URBAN-BENCH为提升微型交通工具的自主性提供了有效工具，未来可进一步优化AI代理的性能。

Abstract: Micromobility, which utilizes lightweight mobile machines moving in urban
public spaces, such as delivery robots and mobility scooters, emerges as a
promising alternative to vehicular mobility. Current micromobility depends
mostly on human manual operation (in-person or remote control), which raises
safety and efficiency concerns when navigating busy urban environments full of
unpredictable obstacles and pedestrians. Assisting humans with AI agents in
maneuvering micromobility devices presents a viable solution for enhancing
safety and efficiency. In this work, we present a scalable urban simulation
solution to advance autonomous micromobility. First, we build URBAN-SIM - a
high-performance robot learning platform for large-scale training of embodied
agents in interactive urban scenes. URBAN-SIM contains three critical modules:
Hierarchical Urban Generation pipeline, Interactive Dynamics Generation
strategy, and Asynchronous Scene Sampling scheme, to improve the diversity,
realism, and efficiency of robot learning in simulation. Then, we propose
URBAN-BENCH - a suite of essential tasks and benchmarks to gauge various
capabilities of the AI agents in achieving autonomous micromobility.
URBAN-BENCH includes eight tasks based on three core skills of the agents:
Urban Locomotion, Urban Navigation, and Urban Traverse. We evaluate four robots
with heterogeneous embodiments, such as the wheeled and legged robots, across
these tasks. Experiments on diverse terrains and urban structures reveal each
robot's strengths and limitations.

TL;DR: RayZer是一个无需3D监督的自监督多视角3D视觉模型，能够从未标注的图像中恢复相机参数、重建场景并生成新视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖3D监督（如相机位姿和场景几何），而RayZer旨在仅通过2D图像实现3D感知，减少标注需求。

Method: 设计了自监督框架和基于Transformer的模型，通过解耦相机与场景表示，仅利用射线结构作为3D先验。

Result: RayZer在生成新视角方面表现优于依赖标注的“oracle”方法。

Conclusion: RayZer展示了自监督方法在3D视觉任务中的潜力，为无监督3D学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present RayZer, a self-supervised multi-view 3D Vision model trained
without any 3D supervision, i.e., camera poses and scene geometry, while
exhibiting emerging 3D awareness. Concretely, RayZer takes unposed and
uncalibrated images as input, recovers camera parameters, reconstructs a scene
representation, and synthesizes novel views. During training, RayZer relies
solely on its self-predicted camera poses to render target views, eliminating
the need for any ground-truth camera annotations and allowing RayZer to be
trained with 2D image supervision. The emerging 3D awareness of RayZer is
attributed to two key factors. First, we design a self-supervised framework,
which achieves 3D-aware auto-encoding of input images by disentangling camera
and scene representations. Second, we design a transformer-based model in which
the only 3D prior is the ray structure, connecting camera, pixel, and scene
simultaneously. RayZer demonstrates comparable or even superior novel view
synthesis performance than ``oracle'' methods that rely on pose annotations in
both training and testing. Project: https://hwjiang1510.github.io/RayZer/

Result: 在T2I-CompBench和WISE基准测试中分别提升13%和19%，超越现有最佳模型FLUX。

Conclusion: T2I-R1展示了双层CoT推理在视觉生成中的有效性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models have demonstrated how
chain-of-thought (CoT) and reinforcement learning (RL) can improve performance.
However, applying such reasoning strategies to the visual generation domain
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present T2I-R1, a novel
reasoning-enhanced text-to-image generation model, powered by RL with a
bi-level CoT reasoning process. Specifically, we identify two levels of CoT
that can be utilized to enhance different stages of generation: (1) the
semantic-level CoT for high-level planning of the prompt and (2) the
token-level CoT for low-level pixel processing during patch-by-patch
generation. To better coordinate these two levels of CoT, we introduce
BiCoT-GRPO with an ensemble of generation rewards, which seamlessly optimizes
both generation CoTs within the same training step. By applying our reasoning
strategies to the baseline model, Janus-Pro, we achieve superior performance
with 13% improvement on T2I-CompBench and 19% improvement on the WISE
benchmark, even surpassing the state-of-the-art model FLUX.1. Code is available

Motivation: 旨在通过多时相影像和NDVI堆栈提升地块边界划分的准确性，并验证模型在不同地理区域的泛化能力。

Method: 使用UNET架构的四种深度学习模型，结合多时相影像和NDVI堆栈，分别在荷兰和巴基斯坦进行训练和评估。

Result: 多时相NDVI堆栈提供了额外的时序信息，显著提升了边界划分效果，且高空间分辨率对小尺度农业区尤为重要。

Conclusion: 研究强调了多尺度地面信息和多时相数据对开发通用地块边界划分模型的重要性，并展示了其在异质农业环境中的扩展潜力。

Abstract: This study explores the effectiveness of multi-temporal satellite imagery for
better functional field boundary delineation using deep learning semantic
segmentation architecture on two distinct geographical and multi-scale farming
systems of Netherlands and Pakistan. Multidate images of April, August and
October 2022 were acquired for PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 in sub regions of
Netherlands and November 2022, February and March 2023 for selected area of
Dunyapur in Pakistan. For Netherlands, Basic registration crop parcels (BRP)
vector layer was used as labeled training data. while self-crafted field
boundary vector data were utilized for Pakistan. Four deep learning models with
UNET architecture were evaluated using different combinations of multi-date
images and NDVI stacks in the Netherlands subregions. A comparative analysis of
IoU scores assessed the effectiveness of the proposed multi-date NDVI stack
approach. These findings were then applied for transfer learning, using
pre-trained models from the Netherlands on the selected area in Pakistan.
Additionally, separate models were trained using self-crafted field boundary
data for Pakistan, and combined models were developed using data from both the
Netherlands and Pakistan. Results indicate that multi-date NDVI stacks provide
additional temporal context, reflecting crop growth over different times of the
season. The study underscores the critical role of multi-scale ground
information from diverse geographical areas in developing robust and
universally applicable models for field boundary delineation. The results also
highlight the importance of fine spatial resolution for extraction of field
boundaries in regions with small scale framing. The findings can be extended to
multi-scale implementations for improved automatic field boundary delineation
in heterogeneous agricultural environments.

Abstract: This position paper critically surveys a broad spectrum of recent empirical
developments on human-AI agents collaboration, highlighting both their
technical achievements and persistent gaps. We observe a lack of a unifying
theoretical framework that can coherently integrate these varied studies,
especially when tackling open-ended, complex tasks. To address this, we propose
a novel conceptual architecture: one that systematically interlinks the
technical details of multi-agent coordination, knowledge management, cybernetic
feedback loops, and higher-level control mechanisms. By mapping existing
contributions, from symbolic AI techniques and connectionist LLM-based agents
to hybrid organizational practices, onto this proposed framework (Hierarchical
Exploration-Exploitation Net), our approach facilitates revision of legacy
methods and inspires new work that fuses qualitative and quantitative
paradigms. The paper's structure allows it to be read from any section, serving
equally as a critical review of technical implementations and as a
forward-looking reference for designing or extending human-AI symbioses.

Conclusion: 提出的逻辑形式化和算法能有效识别神经纤维束，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: This article deals with the description and recognition of fiber bundles, in
particular nerves, in medical images, based on the anatomical description of
the fiber trajectories. To this end, we propose a logical formalization of this
anatomical knowledge. The intrinsically imprecise description of nerves, as
found in anatomical textbooks, leads us to propose fuzzy semantics combined
with first-order logic. We define a language representing spatial entities,
relations between these entities and quantifiers. A formula in this language is
then a formalization of the natural language description. The semantics are
given by fuzzy representations in a concrete domain and satisfaction degrees of
relations. Based on this formalization, a spatial reasoning algorithm is
proposed for segmentation and recognition of nerves from anatomical and
diffusion magnetic resonance images, which is illustrated on pelvic nerves in
pediatric imaging, enabling surgeons to plan surgery.

Method: 基于1,178篇论文（2020年1月至2025年3月），对比企业与高校的研究重点。

Result: 企业研究偏向预部署领域（模型对齐、测试），部署阶段问题（如偏见）关注减少；高风险领域（医疗、金融等）研究不足。

Conclusion: 需提高部署数据的透明度和系统性观察，以弥补知识缺口。

Abstract: Drawing on 1,178 safety and reliability papers from 9,439 generative AI

companies (Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI) and AI
universities (CMU, MIT, NYU, Stanford, UC Berkeley, and University of
Washington). We find that corporate AI research increasingly concentrates on
pre-deployment areas -- model alignment and testing & evaluation -- while
attention to deployment-stage issues such as model bias has waned. Significant
research gaps exist in high-risk deployment domains, including healthcare,
finance, misinformation, persuasive and addictive features, hallucinations, and
copyright. Without improved observability into deployed AI, growing corporate
concentration could deepen knowledge deficits. We recommend expanding external
researcher access to deployment data and systematic observability of in-market
AI behaviors.

Result: 实验显示DeCo任务处理成功率超过80%，且能平衡工作负载。

Conclusion: DeCo作为AI驱动方案，在IC故障分析和任务处理中展现出潜力。

Abstract: In the semiconductor industry, integrated circuit (IC) processes play a vital
role, as the rising complexity and market expectations necessitate improvements
in yield. Identifying IC defects and assigning IC testing tasks to the right
engineers improves efficiency and reduces losses. While current studies
emphasize fault localization or defect classification, they overlook the
integration of defect characteristics, historical failures, and the insights
from engineer expertise, which restrains their effectiveness in improving IC
handling. To leverage AI for these challenges, we propose DeCo, an innovative
approach for optimizing task assignment in IC testing. DeCo constructs a novel
defect-aware graph from IC testing reports, capturing co-failure relationships
to enhance defect differentiation, even with scarce defect data. Additionally,
it formulates defect-aware representations for engineers and tasks, reinforced
by local and global structure modeling on the defect-aware graph. Finally, a
contrasting-based assignment mechanism pairs testing tasks with QA engineers by
considering their skill level and current workload, thus promoting an equitable
and efficient job dispatch. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate
that DeCo achieves the highest task-handling success rates in different
scenarios, exceeding 80\%, while also maintaining balanced workloads on both
scarce or expanded defect data. Moreover, case studies reveal that DeCo can
assign tasks to potentially capable engineers, even for their unfamiliar
defects, highlighting its potential as an AI-driven solution for the real-world
IC failure analysis and task handling.

Result: CognitionNet成功揭示了玩家心理决策和战术，并在性能上显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该研究首次实现了从遥测数据中自动化发现玩家心理和战术，并为玩家参与预测提供了相关诊断解释。

Abstract: Games are one of the safest source of realizing self-esteem and relaxation at
the same time. An online gaming platform typically has massive data coming in,
e.g., in-game actions, player moves, clickstreams, transactions etc. It is
rather interesting, as something as simple as data on gaming moves can help
create a psychological imprint of the user at that moment, based on her
impulsive reactions and response to a situation in the game. Mining this
knowledge can: (a) immediately help better explain observed and predicted
player behavior; and (b) consequently propel deeper understanding towards
players' experience, growth and protection. To this effect, we focus on
discovery of the "game behaviours" as micro-patterns formed by continuous
sequence of games and the persistent "play styles" of the players' as a
sequence of such sequences on an online skill gaming platform for Rummy. We
propose a two stage deep neural network, CognitionNet. The first stage focuses
on mining game behaviours as cluster representations in a latent space while
the second aggregates over these micro patterns to discover play styles via a
supervised classification objective around player engagement. The dual
objective allows CognitionNet to reveal several player psychology inspired
decision making and tactics. To our knowledge, this is the first and
one-of-its-kind research to fully automate the discovery of: (i) player
psychology and game tactics from telemetry data; and (ii) relevant diagnostic
explanations to players' engagement predictions. The collaborative training of
the two networks with differential input dimensions is enabled using a novel
formulation of "bridge loss". The network plays pivotal role in obtaining
homogeneous and consistent play style definitions and significantly outperforms
the SOTA baselines wherever applicable.

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an emerging System of System (SoS) that faces
challenges in system architecture, planning, task management, and execution.
Traditional architectural approaches struggle with scalability, adaptability,
and seamless resource integration within dynamic and complex environments. This
paper presents an intelligent holonic architecture that incorporates Large
Language Model (LLM) to manage the complexities of UAM. Holons function semi
autonomously, allowing for real time coordination among air taxis, ground
transport, and vertiports. LLMs process natural language inputs, generate
adaptive plans, and manage disruptions such as weather changes or airspace
closures.Through a case study of multimodal transportation with electric
scooters and air taxis, we demonstrate how this architecture enables dynamic
resource allocation, real time replanning, and autonomous adaptation without
centralized control, creating more resilient and efficient urban transportation
networks. By advancing decentralized control and AI driven adaptability, this
work lays the groundwork for resilient, human centric UAM ecosystems, with
future efforts targeting hybrid AI integration and real world validation.

Result: 实验证明ScaleTrack有效提升了GUI代理的性能。

Conclusion: ScaleTrack通过改进定位和规划策略，显著提升了自动化GUI代理的任务执行能力。

Abstract: Automated GUI agents aims to facilitate user interaction by automatically
performing complex tasks in digital environments, such as web, mobile, desktop
devices. It receives textual task instruction and GUI description to generate
executable actions (\emph{e.g.}, click) and operation boxes step by step.
Training a GUI agent mainly involves grounding and planning stages, in which
the GUI grounding focuses on finding the execution coordinates according to the
task, while the planning stage aims to predict the next action based on
historical actions. However, previous work suffers from the limitations of
insufficient training data for GUI grounding, as well as the ignorance of
backtracking historical behaviors for GUI planning. To handle the above
challenges, we propose ScaleTrack, a training framework by scaling grounding
and backtracking planning for automated GUI agents. We carefully collected GUI
samples of different synthesis criterions from a wide range of sources, and
unified them into the same template for training GUI grounding models.
Moreover, we design a novel training strategy that predicts the next action
from the current GUI image, while also backtracking the historical actions that
led to the GUI image. In this way, ScaleTrack explains the correspondence
between GUI images and actions, which effectively describes the evolution rules
of the GUI environment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of ScaleTrack. Data and code will be available at url.

Conclusion: 扩展的分类器框架更贴近法律推理实际，为法律领域分类器研究提供新方向。

Abstract: We extend the formal framework of classifier models used in the legal domain.
While the existing classifier framework characterises cases solely through the
facts involved, legal reasoning fundamentally relies on both facts and rules,
particularly the ratio decidendi. This paper presents an initial approach to
incorporating sets of rules within a classifier. Our work is built on the work
of Canavotto et al. (2023), which has developed the rule-based reason model of
precedential constraint within a hierarchy of factors. We demonstrate how
decisions for new cases can be inferred using this enriched rule-based
classifier framework. Additionally, we provide an example of how the time
element and the hierarchy of courts can be used in the new classifier
framework.

TL;DR: GPT4在类比推理中召回率高但精度低，人类则精度高但召回率低，表明AI适合生成类比，人类适合评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究GPT4是否能在战略决策的类比推理中匹配人类能力。

Method: 采用源到目标匹配的实验设计，比较GPT4和人类的表现。

Result: GPT4召回率高但精度低，人类精度高但召回率低，AI错误源于表面匹配，人类错误源于因果误解。

Conclusion: AI适合生成类比，人类适合评估，形成互补分工。

Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models, specifically GPT4, can
match human capabilities in analogical reasoning within strategic decision
making contexts. Using a novel experimental design involving source to target
matching, we find that GPT4 achieves high recall by retrieving all plausible
analogies but suffers from low precision, frequently applying incorrect
analogies based on superficial similarities. In contrast, human participants
exhibit high precision but low recall, selecting fewer analogies yet with
stronger causal alignment. These findings advance theory by identifying
matching, the evaluative phase of analogical reasoning, as a distinct step that
requires accurate causal mapping beyond simple retrieval. While current LLMs
are proficient in generating candidate analogies, humans maintain a comparative
advantage in recognizing deep structural similarities across domains. Error
analysis reveals that AI errors arise from surface level matching, whereas
human errors stem from misinterpretations of causal structure. Taken together,
the results suggest a productive division of labor in AI assisted
organizational decision making where LLMs may serve as broad analogy
generators, while humans act as critical evaluators, applying the most
contextually appropriate analogies to strategic problems.

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了MCTS的可解释性，增强了用户对AI的信任。

Abstract: In response to the lack of trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI) for
sequential planning, we design a Computational Tree Logic-guided large language
model (LLM)-based natural language explanation framework designed for the Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. MCTS is often considered challenging to
interpret due to the complexity of its search trees, but our framework is
flexible enough to handle a wide range of free-form post-hoc queries and
knowledge-based inquiries centered around MCTS and the Markov Decision Process
(MDP) of the application domain. By transforming user queries into logic and
variable statements, our framework ensures that the evidence obtained from the
search tree remains factually consistent with the underlying environmental
dynamics and any constraints in the actual stochastic control process. We
evaluate the framework rigorously through quantitative assessments, where it
demonstrates strong performance in terms of accuracy and factual consistency.

Conclusion: 呼吁将AI竞赛的严谨性应用于生成式AI评估，以提升其可靠性。

Abstract: In this position paper, we observe that empirical evaluation in Generative AI
is at a crisis point since traditional ML evaluation and benchmarking
strategies are insufficient to meet the needs of evaluating modern GenAI models
and systems. There are many reasons for this, including the fact that these
models typically have nearly unbounded input and output spaces, typically do
not have a well defined ground truth target, and typically exhibit strong
feedback loops and prediction dependence based on context of previous model
outputs. On top of these critical issues, we argue that the problems of {\em
leakage} and {\em contamination} are in fact the most important and difficult
issues to address for GenAI evaluations. Interestingly, the field of AI
Competitions has developed effective measures and practices to combat leakage
for the purpose of counteracting cheating by bad actors within a competition
setting. This makes AI Competitions an especially valuable (but underutilized)
resource. Now is time for the field to view AI Competitions as the gold
standard for empirical rigor in GenAI evaluation, and to harness and harvest
their results with according value.

Conclusion: 开源LLM为车联网管理提供了安全、自适应且可扩展的解决方案，是专有系统的有力替代。

Abstract: The proliferation of connected vehicles within the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)
ecosystem presents critical challenges in ensuring scalable, real-time, and
privacy-preserving traffic management. Existing centralized IoV solutions often
suffer from high latency, limited scalability, and reliance on proprietary
Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, creating significant barriers to
widespread deployment, particularly in dynamic and privacy-sensitive
environments. Meanwhile, integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in vehicular
systems remains underexplored, especially concerning prompt optimization and
effective utilization in federated contexts. To address these challenges, we
propose the Federated Prompt-Optimized Traffic Transformer (FPoTT), a novel
framework that leverages open-source LLMs for predictive IoV management. FPoTT
introduces a dynamic prompt optimization mechanism that iteratively refines
textual prompts to enhance trajectory prediction. The architecture employs a
dual-layer federated learning paradigm, combining lightweight edge models for
real-time inference with cloud-based LLMs to retain global intelligence. A
Transformer-driven synthetic data generator is incorporated to augment training
with diverse, high-fidelity traffic scenarios in the Next Generation Simulation
(NGSIM) format. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that FPoTT, utilizing
EleutherAI Pythia-1B, achieves 99.86% prediction accuracy on real-world data
while maintaining high performance on synthetic datasets. These results
underscore the potential of open-source LLMs in enabling secure, adaptive, and
scalable IoV management, offering a promising alternative to proprietary
solutions in smart mobility ecosystems.

Motivation: 优化跑步表现、定制训练计划和运动员健康管理需要理解跑步时的生理反应，但现有方法难以实现高精度且便捷的代谢监测。

Method: 采用两种互补的生理模型：1) 基于生理约束ODE和神经卡尔曼滤波器的心率动态建模；2) 利用心率建模原理的新型VO₂预测架构，仅需初始VO₂数据校准。

Conclusion: 该框架通过将生理约束嵌入现代机器学习，实现了实验室级精度的代谢监测，为精英运动员和健身爱好者提供了便捷工具。

Abstract: Understanding physiological responses during running is critical for
performance optimization, tailored training prescriptions, and athlete health
management. We introduce a comprehensive framework -- what we believe to be the
first capable of predicting instantaneous oxygen consumption (VO$_{2}$)
trajectories exclusively from consumer-grade wearable data. Our approach
employs two complementary physiological models: (1) accurate modeling of heart
rate (HR) dynamics via a physiologically constrained ordinary differential
equation (ODE) and neural Kalman filter, trained on over 3 million HR
observations, achieving 1-second interval predictions with mean absolute errors
as low as 2.81\,bpm (correlation 0.87); and (2) leveraging the principles of
precise HR modeling, a novel VO$_{2}$ prediction architecture requiring only
the initial second of VO$_{2}$ data for calibration, enabling robust,
sequence-to-sequence metabolic demand estimation. Despite relying solely on
smartwatch and chest-strap data, our method achieves mean absolute percentage
errors of approximately 13\%, effectively capturing rapid physiological
transitions and steady-state conditions across diverse running intensities. Our
synchronized dataset, complemented by blood lactate measurements, further lays
the foundation for future noninvasive metabolic zone identification. By
embedding physiological constraints within modern machine learning, this
framework democratizes advanced metabolic monitoring, bridging laboratory-grade
accuracy and everyday accessibility, thus empowering both elite athletes and
recreational fitness enthusiasts.

Motivation: 结合高斯混合和粒子滤波技术的优势，提升多目标滤波性能。

Result: 在实验中，EnGM-PHD滤波器在相同组件或粒子数量下，性能优于GM-PHD和SMC-PHD滤波器。

Conclusion: EnGM-PHD滤波器在多目标滤波中表现优异，且在特定情况下可简化为标准EnGMF。

Abstract: In this work, a kernel-based Ensemble Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis
Density (EnGM-PHD) filter is presented for multi-target filtering applications.
The EnGM-PHD filter combines the Gaussian-mixture-based techniques of the
Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density (GM-PHD) filter with the
particle-based techniques of the Sequential Monte Carlo Probability Hypothesis
Density (SMC-PHD) filter. It achieves this by obtaining particles from the
posterior intensity function, propagating them through the system dynamics, and
then using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) techniques to approximate the
Gaussian mixture of the prior intensity function. This approach guarantees
convergence to the true intensity function in the limit of the number of
components. Moreover, in the special case of a single target with no births,
deaths, clutter, and perfect detection probability, the EnGM-PHD filter reduces
to the standard Ensemble Gaussian Mixture Filter (EnGMF). In the presented
experiment, the results indicate that the EnGM-PHD filter achieves better
multi-target filtering performance than both the GM-PHD and SMC-PHD filters
while using the same number of components or particles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Python是AI开发的主流语言，但现有库（如PyTorch、TensorFlow）仅依赖BLAS后端的并行化可能导致性能和扩展性下降。

Method: 使用pybind11将异步HPX C++代码绑定到Python API，开发并行高斯过程库GPRat。

Result: GPRat在64核AMD EPYC 7742 CPU上训练时扩展性优于GPyTorch和GPflow，预测速度分别提升7.63倍和25.25倍。特征数增加时，速度提升更显著。

Conclusion: 异步任务在Python AI应用中具有潜力，GPRat展示了高性能和易用性的结合。

Abstract: Python is the de-facto language for software development in artificial
intelligence (AI). Commonly used libraries, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow,
rely on parallelization built into their BLAS backends to achieve speedup on
CPUs. However, only applying parallelization in a low-level backend can lead to
performance and scaling degradation. In this work, we present a novel way of
binding task-based C++ code built on the asynchronous runtime model HPX to a
high-level Python API using pybind11. We develop a parallel Gaussian process
(GP) li- brary as an application. The resulting Python library GPRat combines
the ease of use of commonly available GP libraries with the performance and
scalability of asynchronous runtime systems. We evaluate the per- formance on a
mass-spring-damper system, a standard benchmark from control theory, for
varying numbers of regressors (features). The results show almost no binding
overhead when binding the asynchronous HPX code using pybind11. Compared to
GPyTorch and GPflow, GPRat shows superior scaling on up to 64 cores on an AMD
EPYC 7742 CPU for train- ing. Furthermore, our library achieves a prediction
speedup of 7.63 over GPyTorch and 25.25 over GPflow. If we increase the number
of features from eight to 128, we observe speedups of 29.62 and 21.19,
respectively. These results showcase the potential of using asynchronous tasks
within Python-based AI applications.

Conclusion: BF-SSD展示了双保真度策略在零阶优化中的有效性，为大规模高维问题提供了高效的计算解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient optimization remains a fundamental challenge across numerous
scientific and engineering domains, especially when objective function and
gradient evaluations are computationally expensive. While zeroth-order
optimization methods offer effective approaches when gradients are
inaccessible, their practical performance can be limited by the high cost
associated with function queries. This work introduces the bi-fidelity
stochastic subspace descent (BF-SSD) algorithm, a novel zeroth-order
optimization method designed to reduce this computational burden. BF-SSD
leverages a bi-fidelity framework, constructing a surrogate model from a
combination of computationally inexpensive low-fidelity (LF) and accurate
high-fidelity (HF) function evaluations. This surrogate model facilitates an
efficient backtracking line search for step size selection, for which we
provide theoretical convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. We
perform a comprehensive empirical evaluation of BF-SSD across four distinct
problems: a synthetic optimization benchmark, dual-form kernel ridge
regression, black-box adversarial attacks on machine learning models, and
transformer-based black-box language model fine-tuning. Numerical results
demonstrate that BF-SSD consistently achieves superior optimization performance
while requiring significantly fewer HF function evaluations compared to
relevant baseline methods. This study highlights the efficacy of integrating
bi-fidelity strategies within zeroth-order optimization, positioning BF-SSD as
a promising and computationally efficient approach for tackling large-scale,
high-dimensional problems encountered in various real-world applications.

Result: 模型准确率达70%，优于传统统计方法，并识别出新影响因素（如手术时长）。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提升预测性能，还为临床医生提供了患者特异性见解，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is a relentless challenge in
oncology, with recurrence rates soaring as high as 70-80%. Each recurrence
triggers a cascade of invasive procedures, lifelong surveillance, and
escalating healthcare costs - affecting 460,000 individuals worldwide. However,
existing clinical prediction tools remain fundamentally flawed, often
overestimating recurrence risk and failing to provide personalized insights for
patient management. In this work, we propose an interpretable deep learning
framework that integrates vector embeddings and attention mechanisms to improve
NMIBC recurrence prediction performance. We incorporate vector embeddings for
categorical variables such as smoking status and intravesical treatments,
allowing the model to capture complex relationships between patient attributes
and recurrence risk. These embeddings provide a richer representation of the
data, enabling improved feature interactions and enhancing prediction
performance. Our approach not only enhances performance but also provides
clinicians with patient-specific insights by highlighting the most influential
features contributing to recurrence risk for each patient. Our model achieves
accuracy of 70% with tabular data, outperforming conventional statistical
methods while providing clinician-friendly patient-level explanations through
feature attention. Unlike previous studies, our approach identifies new
important factors influencing recurrence, such as surgical duration and
hospital stay, which had not been considered in existing NMIBC prediction
models.

Abstract: Chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney
disease, and thyroid disorders, are the leading causes of premature mortality
worldwide. Early detection and intervention are crucial for improving patient
outcomes, yet traditional diagnostic methods often fail due to the complex
nature of these conditions. This study explores the application of machine
learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to predict chronic disease and
thyroid disorders. We used a variety of models, including Logistic Regression
(LR), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT), Neural Networks (NN),
Decision Trees (DT) and Native Bayes (NB), to analyze and predict disease
outcomes. Our methodology involved comprehensive data pre-processing, including
handling missing values, categorical encoding, and feature aggregation,
followed by model training and evaluation. Performance metrics such ad
precision, recall, accuracy, F1-score, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) were used
to assess the effectiveness of each model. The results demonstrated that
ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Trees consistently
outperformed. Neutral Networks also showed superior performance, particularly
in capturing complex data patterns. The findings highlight the potential of ML
and DL in revolutionizing chronic disease prediction, enabling early diagnosis
and personalized treatment strategies. However, challenges such as data

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 稀疏自编码器（SAEs）通过字典学习从神经网络中提取可解释特征，但计算成本高。研究发现字典重要性遵循幂律分布，比较了基于子集剪枝的渐进编码与联合训练嵌套SAEs（Matryoshka SAEs）的性能。Matryoshka SAEs重建损失更低，但剪枝后的普通SAEs更具可解释性。

Motivation: 探索稀疏自编码器在提取可解释特征时的计算效率与性能权衡。

Method: 比较渐进编码（基于子集剪枝）与联合训练嵌套SAEs（Matryoshka SAEs）在语言建模任务中的表现。

Result: Matryoshka SAEs重建损失更低，语言建模损失更小，表示相似性更高；剪枝后的普通SAEs更具可解释性。

Conclusion: Matryoshka SAEs性能更优，但普通SAEs剪枝后更具可解释性，需权衡计算成本与可解释性。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
\citep{bricken2023monosemanticity,gao2024scalingevaluatingsparseautoencoders}
rely on dictionary learning to extract interpretable features from neural
networks at scale in an unsupervised manner, with applications to
representation engineering and information retrieval. SAEs are, however,
computationally expensive \citep{lieberum2024gemmascopeopensparse}, especially
when multiple SAEs of different sizes are needed. We show that dictionary
importance in vanilla SAEs follows a power law. We compare progressive coding
based on subset pruning of SAEs -- to jointly training nested SAEs, or
so-called {\em Matryoshka} SAEs
\citep{bussmann2024learning,nabeshima2024Matryoshka} -- on a language modeling
task. We show Matryoshka SAEs exhibit lower reconstruction loss and recaptured
language modeling loss, as well as higher representational similarity. Pruned
vanilla SAEs are more interpretable, however. We discuss the origins and
implications of this trade-off.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于群体空间对齐或时间结构化数据，无法有效捕捉个体差异。

Conclusion: 该框架为计算神经科学和临床研究提供了可扩展且个体化的大脑活动建模方法。

Abstract: Mental and cognitive representations are believed to reside on
low-dimensional, non-linear manifolds embedded within high-dimensional brain
activity. Uncovering these manifolds is key to understanding individual
differences in brain function, yet most existing machine learning methods
either rely on population-level spatial alignment or assume data that is
temporally structured, either because data is aligned among subjects or because
event timings are known. We introduce a manifold learning framework that can
capture subject-specific spatial variations across both structured and
temporally unstructured neuroimaging data. On simulated data and two
naturalistic fMRI datasets (Sherlock and Forrest Gump), our framework
outperforms group-based baselines by recovering more accurate and
individualized representations. We further show that the framework scales
efficiently to large datasets and generalizes well to new subjects. To test
this, we apply the framework to temporally unstructured resting-state fMRI data
from individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls. We further apply our
method to a large resting-state fMRI dataset comprising individuals with
schizophrenia and controls. In this setting, we demonstrate that the framework
scales efficiently to large populations and generalizes robustly to unseen
subjects. The learned subject-specific spatial maps our model finds reveal
clinically relevant patterns, including increased activation in the basal
ganglia, visual, auditory, and somatosensory regions, and decreased activation
in the insula, inferior frontal gyrus, and angular gyrus. These findings
suggest that our framework can uncover clinically relevant subject-specific
brain activity patterns. Our approach thus provides a scalable and
individualized framework for modeling brain activity, with applications in
computational neuroscience and clinical research.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了生成式机器学习在动态制造系统中的应用，提出了分类框架并分析了其控制潜力，同时指出了研究空白和未来方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态制造过程的复杂特性需要先进的监控和控制技术，而生成式机器学习在建模和不确定性处理方面具有潜力，但缺乏控制导向的视角。

Method: 提出了基于预测、直接策略、质量推断和知识整合的分类框架，分析生成式机器学习架构的控制相关特性。

Result: 生成式机器学习在决策、过程指导、模拟和数字孪生中展现出潜力，但存在生成与控制功能分离等问题。

Conclusion: 未来研究应开发结合生成式机器学习和控制技术的集成框架，以应对动态制造系统的复杂性。

Abstract: Dynamic manufacturing processes exhibit complex characteristics defined by
time-varying parameters, nonlinear behaviors, and uncertainties. These
characteristics require sophisticated in-situ monitoring techniques utilizing
multimodal sensor data and adaptive control systems that can respond to
real-time feedback while maintaining product quality. Recently, generative
machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling complex
distributions and generating synthetic data while handling these manufacturing
uncertainties. However, adopting these generative technologies in dynamic
manufacturing systems lacks a functional control-oriented perspective to
translate their probabilistic understanding into actionable process controls
while respecting constraints. This review presents a functional classification
of Prediction-Based, Direct Policy, Quality Inference, and Knowledge-Integrated
approaches, offering a perspective for understanding existing ML-enhanced
control systems and incorporating generative ML. The analysis of generative ML
architectures within this framework demonstrates control-relevant properties
and potential to extend current ML-enhanced approaches where conventional
methods prove insufficient. We show generative ML's potential for manufacturing
control through decision-making applications, process guidance, simulation, and
digital twins, while identifying critical research gaps: separation between
generation and control functions, insufficient physical understanding of
manufacturing phenomena, and challenges adapting models from other domains. To
address these challenges, we propose future research directions aimed at
developing integrated frameworks that combine generative ML and control
technologies to address the dynamic complexities of modern manufacturing
systems.

### [138] [Online Federation For Mixtures of Proprietary Agents with Black-Box Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00216)
*Xuwei Yang,Fatemeh Tavakoli,David B. Emerson,Anastasis Kratsios*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对黑盒生成AI的联邦学习算法，解决了多专家集成模型中的参数优化问题，并通过博弈论证明了纳什均衡的存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于行业标准生成AI和特征编码器多为黑盒，用户无法优化其内部参数，限制了多专家集成模型的构建。

Method: 采用非竞争博弈论视角，设计了一种去中心化的联邦学习算法，各AI代理在本地优化结构，无需共享内部参数。

Result: 算法在真实和合成时间序列基准测试中取得了显著的预测精度提升。

Conclusion: 提出的专有联邦学习算法有效解决了黑盒AI集成问题，填补了该领域的空白。

Abstract: Most industry-standard generative AIs and feature encoders are proprietary,
offering only black-box access: their outputs are observable, but their
internal parameters and architectures remain hidden from the end-user. This
black-box access is especially limiting when constructing mixture-of-expert
type ensemble models since the user cannot optimize each proprietary AI's
internal parameters. Our problem naturally lends itself to a non-competitive
game-theoretic lens where each proprietary AI (agent) is inherently competing
against the other AI agents, with this competition arising naturally due to
their obliviousness of the AI's to their internal structure. In contrast, the
user acts as a central planner trying to synchronize the ensemble of competing
AIs.
  We show the existence of the unique Nash equilibrium in the online setting,
which we even compute in closed-form by eliciting a feedback mechanism between
any given time series and the sequence generated by each (proprietary) AI
agent. Our solution is implemented as a decentralized, federated-learning
algorithm in which each agent optimizes their structure locally on their
machine without ever releasing any internal structure to the others. We obtain
refined expressions for pre-trained models such as transformers, random feature
models, and echo-state networks. Our ``proprietary federated learning''
algorithm is implemented on a range of real-world and synthetic time-series
benchmarks. It achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements in predictive accuracy
over natural benchmarks, of which there are surprisingly few due to this
natural problem still being largely unexplored.

*Bogireddy Sai Prasanna Teja,Valliappan Muthukaruppan,Carls Benjamin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于历史数据的纵向表格Transformer模型（LTT），用于提高电力恢复时间（ETR）预测的准确性，显著提升客户满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变异性增加，传统方法无法提供精确的ETR预测，影响客户在自然灾害中的决策。

Method: 使用LTT模型，结合历史停电事件数据和顺序更新，评估了34,000次风暴相关停电事件。

Result: LTT模型将客户满意度指标（CSI）平均提高19.08%，并引入客户导向的回归指标。

Conclusion: LTT模型不仅提高了预测准确性，还通过可解释性技术增强了透明度，提升了客户信任。

Abstract: As climate variability increases, the ability of utility providers to deliver
precise Estimated Times of Restoration (ETR) during natural disasters has
become increasingly critical. Accurate and timely ETRs are essential for
enabling customer preparedness during extended power outages, where informed
decision-making can be crucial, particularly in severe weather conditions.
Nonetheless, prevailing utility practices predominantly depend on manual
assessments or traditional statistical methods, which often fail to achieve the
level of precision required for reliable and actionable predictions. To address
these limitations, we propose a Longitudinal Tabular Transformer (LTT) model
that leverages historical outage event data along with sequential updates of
these events to improve the accuracy of ETR predictions. The model's
performance was evaluated over 34,000 storm-related outage events from three
major utility companies, collectively serving over 3 million customers over a
2-year period. Results demonstrate that the LTT model improves the Customer
Satisfaction Impact (CSI) metric by an average of 19.08% (p > 0.001) compared
to existing methods. Additionally, we introduce customer-informed regression
metrics that align model evaluation with real-world satisfaction, ensuring the
outcomes resonate with customer expectations. Furthermore, we employ
interpretability techniques to analyze the temporal significance of
incorporating sequential updates in modeling outage events and to identify the
contributions of predictive features to a given ETR. This comprehensive
approach not only improves predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency,
fostering greater trust in the model's capabilities.

Abstract: Driven by the advancements in generative AI, large machine learning models
have revolutionized domains such as image processing, audio synthesis, and

accelerator with the widest reach, we present ML Drift--an optimized framework
that extends the capabilities of state-of-the-art GPU-accelerated inference
engines. ML Drift enables on-device execution of generative AI workloads which
contain 10 to 100x more parameters than existing on-device generative AI
models. ML Drift addresses intricate engineering challenges associated with
cross-GPU API development, and ensures broad compatibility across mobile and
desktop/laptop platforms, thereby facilitating the deployment of significantly
more complex models on resource-constrained devices. Our GPU-accelerated ML/AI
inference engine achieves an order-of-magnitude performance improvement
relative to existing open-source GPU inference engines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少对任务特定知识工程的依赖，探索LLM代理如何通过自我生成的成功经验数据库自动提升性能。

Method: 构建并优化自我生成的示例数据库，引入数据库级和示例级选择方法。

Result: 在ALFWorld、Wordcraft和InterCode-SQL三个基准上显著提升性能，最高达到91%。

Conclusion: 自动轨迹数据库构建是替代人工知识工程的有效方法。

Abstract: Many methods for improving Large Language Model (LLM) agents for sequential
decision-making tasks depend on task-specific knowledge engineering--such as
prompt tuning, curated in-context examples, or customized observation and
action spaces. Using these approaches, agent performance improves with the
quality or amount of knowledge engineering invested. Instead, we investigate
how LLM agents can automatically improve their performance by learning
in-context from their own successful experiences on similar tasks. Rather than
relying on task-specific knowledge engineering, we focus on constructing and
refining a database of self-generated examples. We demonstrate that even a
naive accumulation of successful trajectories across training tasks boosts test
performance on three benchmarks: ALFWorld (73% to 89%), Wordcraft (55% to 64%),
and InterCode-SQL (75% to 79%)--matching the performance the initial agent
achieves if allowed two to three attempts per task. We then introduce two
extensions: (1) database-level selection through population-based training to
identify high-performing example collections, and (2) exemplar-level selection
that retains individual trajectories based on their empirical utility as
in-context examples. These extensions further enhance performance, achieving
91% on ALFWorld--matching more complex approaches that employ task-specific
components and prompts. Our results demonstrate that automatic trajectory
database construction offers a compelling alternative to labor-intensive
knowledge engineering.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese medicine, as an essential component of traditional
medicine, contains active ingredients that serve as a crucial source for modern
drug development, holding immense therapeutic potential and development value.
A multi-layered and complex network is formed from Chinese medicine to diseases
and used to predict the potential associations between Chinese medicine
ingredients and diseases. This study proposes an ingredient-disease association
prediction model (Node2Vec-DGI-EL) based on hierarchical graph representation
learning. First, the model uses the Node2Vec algorithm to extract node
embedding vectors from the network as the initial features of the nodes. Next,
the network nodes are deeply represented and learned using the DGI algorithm to
enhance the model's expressive power. To improve prediction accuracy and
robustness, an ensemble learning method is incorporated to achieve more
accurate ingredient-disease association predictions. The effectiveness of the
model is then evaluated through a series of theoretical verifications. The
results demonstrated that the proposed model significantly outperformed
existing methods, achieving an AUC of 0.9987 and an AUPR of 0.9545, thereby
indicating superior predictive capability. Ablation experiments further
revealed the contribution and importance of each module. Additionally, case
studies explored potential associations, such as triptonide with hypertensive
retinopathy and methyl ursolate with colorectal cancer. Molecular docking
experiments validated these findings, showing the triptonide-PGR interaction
and the methyl ursolate-NFE2L2 interaction can bind stable. In conclusion, the
Node2Vec-DGI-EL model focuses on TCM datasets and effectively predicts
ingredient-disease associations, overcoming the reliance on node semantic
information.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融机构对外部数据共享需求强烈，但隐私问题导致平台互联困难、数据开放度低。

Method: 将跨境组织的异构业务数据分布作为子图，通过中央服务器构建统计异构全局图，子图通过本地训练学习个性化服务模型，选择并更新相关子图子集。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法比现有方法具有更高的准确性和更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: HFGNN方法有效解决了金融数据隐私问题，实现了异构数据的联合画像。

Abstract: The sharing of external data has become a strong demand of financial
institutions, but the privacy issue has led to the difficulty of
interconnecting different platforms and the low degree of data openness. To
effectively solve the privacy problem of financial data in trans-border flow
and sharing, to ensure that the data is available but not visible, to realize
the joint portrait of all kinds of heterogeneous data of business organizations
in different industries, we propose a Heterogeneous Federated Graph Neural
Network (HFGNN) approach. In this method, the distribution of heterogeneous
business data of trans-border organizations is taken as subgraphs, and the
sharing and circulation process among subgraphs is constructed as a
statistically heterogeneous global graph through a central server. Each
subgraph learns the corresponding personalized service model through local
training to select and update the relevant subset of subgraphs with aggregated
parameters, and effectively separates and combines topological and feature
information among subgraphs. Finally, our simulation experimental results show
that the proposed method has higher accuracy performance and faster convergence
speed than existing methods.

Motivation: 传统WCM模型在复杂农业景观中表现受限，需改进以更准确地估计土壤湿度。

Method: 提出了一种知识引导的LSTM模型，结合WCM原理和双组分损失函数，利用SAR数据和植被信息进行SM估计。

Result: 模型减少了SM估计不确定性0.02 m³/m³，在多变植被覆盖和地表条件下相关系数达0.64。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了WCM的过度简化问题，展示了在复杂场景中估计SM的潜力。

Abstract: Soil moisture (SM) estimation from active microwave data remains challenging
due to the complex interactions between radar backscatter and surface
characteristics. While the water cloud model (WCM) provides a semi-physical
approach for understanding these interactions, its empirical component often
limits performance across diverse agricultural landscapes. This research
presents preliminary efforts for developing a knowledge-guided deep learning
approach, which integrates WCM principles into a long short-term memory (LSTM)
model, to estimate field SM using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
data. Our proposed approach leverages LSTM's capacity to capture spatiotemporal
dependencies while maintaining physical consistency through a modified
dual-component loss function, including a WCM-based semi-physical component and
a boundary condition regularisation. The proposed approach is built upon the
soil backscatter coefficients isolated from the total backscatter, together
with Landsat-resolution vegetation information and surface characteristics. A
four-fold spatial cross-validation was performed against in-situ SM data to
assess the model performance. Results showed the proposed approach reduced SM
retrieval uncertainties by 0.02 m$^3$/m$^3$ and achieved correlation
coefficients (R) of up to 0.64 in areas with varying vegetation cover and
surface conditions, demonstrating the potential to address the
over-simplification in WCM.

Abstract: Accurately estimating human skill levels is crucial for designing effective
human-AI interactions so that AI can provide appropriate challenges or
guidance. In games where AI players have beaten top human professionals,
strength estimation plays a key role in adapting AI behavior to match human
skill levels. In a previous state-of-the-art study, researchers have proposed a
strength estimator trained using human players' match data. Given some matches,
the strength estimator computes strength scores and uses them to estimate
player ranks (skill levels). In this paper, we focus on the observation that
human players' behavior tendency varies according to their strength and aim to
improve the accuracy of strength estimation by taking this into account.
Specifically, in addition to strength scores, we obtain policies for different
skill levels from neural networks trained using human players' match data. We
then combine features based on these policies with the strength scores to
estimate strength. We conducted experiments on Go and chess. For Go, our method
achieved an accuracy of 80% in strength estimation when given 10 matches, which
increased to 92% when given 20 matches. In comparison, the previous
state-of-the-art method had an accuracy of 71% with 10 matches and 84% with 20
matches, demonstrating improvements of 8-9%. We observed similar improvements
in chess. These results contribute to developing a more accurate strength
estimation method and to improving human-AI interaction.

Conclusion: HMFNet在分子结构表示和AI驱动技术发展方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Molecular odor prediction is the process of using a molecule's structure to
predict its smell. While accurate prediction remains challenging, AI models can
suggest potential odors. Existing methods, however, often rely on basic
descriptors or handcrafted fingerprints, which lack expressive power and hinder
effective learning. Furthermore, these methods suffer from severe class
imbalance, limiting the training effectiveness of AI models. To address these
challenges, we propose a Feature Contribution-driven Hierarchical Multi-Feature
Mapping Network (HMFNet). Specifically, we introduce a fine-grained, Local
Multi-Hierarchy Feature Extraction module (LMFE) that performs deep feature
extraction at the atomic level, capturing detailed features crucial for odor
prediction. To enhance the extraction of discriminative atomic features, we
integrate a Harmonic Modulated Feature Mapping (HMFM). This module dynamically
learns feature importance and frequency modulation, improving the model's
capability to capture relevant patterns. Additionally, a Global Multi-Hierarchy
Feature Extraction module (GMFE) is designed to learn global features from the
molecular graph topology, enabling the model to fully leverage global
information and enhance its discriminative power for odor prediction. To
further mitigate the issue of class imbalance, we propose a Chemically-Informed
Loss (CIL). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves performance across various deep learning models, highlighting its
potential to advance molecular structure representation and accelerate the
development of AI-driven technologies.

Method: 使用sum聚合和ReLU激活的循环GNNs，并引入随机初始化。

Result: 循环GNNs可以模拟任何尊重颜色细化不变性的图算法，且多项式时间复杂度的算法均可被模拟。

Conclusion: 循环GNNs的表达能力达到了理论极限，且在随机初始化下可以模拟所有图算法。

Abstract: We provide first tight bounds for the expressivity of Recurrent Graph Neural
Networks (recurrent GNNs) with finite-precision parameters. We prove that
recurrent GNNs, with sum aggregation and ReLU activation, can emulate any graph
algorithm that respects the natural message-passing invariance induced by the
color refinement (or Weisfeiler-Leman) algorithm. While it is well known that
the expressive power of GNNs is limited by this invariance [Morris et al., AAAI
2019; Xu et al., ICLR 2019], we establish that recurrent GNNs can actually
reach this limit. This is in contrast to non-recurrent GNNs, which have the
power of Weisfeiler-Leman only in a very weak, "non-uniform", sense where every
graph size requires a different GNN model to compute with. The emulation we
construct introduces only a polynomial overhead in both time and space.
  Furthermore, we show that by incorporating random initialization, recurrent
GNNs can emulate all graph algorithms, implying in particular that any graph
algorithm with polynomial-time complexity can be emulated by a recurrent GNN
with random initialization, running in polynomial time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常假设固定图结构，而现实场景中图结构是动态的，且时间序列的交互在不同时间尺度上变化显著。

Method: 结合因果时间卷积和多头自注意力机制学习节点时间特征，并基于这些特征构建动态图结构，同时使用统一神经网络生成预测。

Result: 在METR-LA和PEMS-BAY数据集上验证了TAEGCN的优越性能。

Conclusion: TAEGCN能有效捕捉时空特征，提升预测精度。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting enables the prediction of future states
by leveraging historical data, thereby facilitating decision-making processes.
Each data node in a multivariate time series encompasses a sequence of multiple
dimensions. These nodes exhibit interdependent relationships, forming a graph
structure. While existing prediction methods often assume a fixed graph
structure, many real-world scenarios involve dynamic graph structures.
Moreover, interactions among time series observed at different time scales vary
significantly. To enhance prediction accuracy by capturing precise temporal and
spatial features, this paper introduces the Temporal Attention Evolutional
Graph Convolutional Network (TAEGCN). This novel method not only integrates
causal temporal convolution and a multi-head self-attention mechanism to learn
temporal features of nodes, but also construct the dynamic graph structure
based on these temporal features to keep the consistency of the changing in
spatial feature with temporal series. TAEGCN adeptly captures temporal causal
relationships and hidden spatial dependencies within the data. Furthermore,
TAEGCN incorporates a unified neural network that seamlessly integrates these
components to generate final predictions. Experimental results conducted on two
public transportation network datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed model.

Abstract: There has been a recent surge of interest in time series modeling using the
Transformer architecture. However, forecasting multivariate time series with
Transformer presents a unique challenge as it requires modeling both temporal
(cross-time) and variate (cross-variate) dependencies. While Transformer-based
models have gained popularity for their flexibility in capturing both
sequential and cross-variate relationships, it is unclear how to best integrate
these two sources of information in the context of the Transformer architecture
while optimizing for both performance and efficiency. We re-purpose the
Transformer architecture to effectively model both cross-time and cross-variate
dependencies. Our approach begins by embedding each variate independently into
a variate-wise representation that captures its cross-time dynamics, and then
models cross-variate dependencies through attention mechanisms on these learned
embeddings. Gating operations in both cross-time and cross-variate modeling
phases regulate information flow, allowing the model to focus on the most
relevant features for accurate predictions. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across 13 real-world datasets and can be
seamlessly integrated into other Transformer-based and LLM-based forecasters,
delivering performance improvements up to 20.7\% over original models. Code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoSA提出了一种动态稀疏注意力机制，通过选择关键令牌降低计算复杂度，性能优于密集注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自注意力机制的高计算成本问题，同时保持或提升性能。

Method: 采用混合稀疏注意力（MoSA），动态选择令牌，降低计算复杂度。

Result: MoSA在相同计算预算下性能优于密集基线，资源使用更少。

Conclusion: MoSA是一种高效且性能优越的稀疏注意力方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models highlighted the excessive quadratic
cost of self-attention. Despite the significant research efforts, subquadratic
attention methods still suffer from inferior performance in practice. We
hypothesize that dynamic, learned content-based sparsity can lead to more
efficient attention mechanisms. We present Mixture of Sparse Attention (MoSA),
a novel approach inspired by Mixture of Experts (MoE) with expert choice
routing. MoSA dynamically selects tokens for each attention head, allowing
arbitrary sparse attention patterns. By selecting $k$ tokens from a sequence of
length $T$, MoSA reduces the computational complexity of each attention head
from $O(T^2)$ to $O(k^2 + T)$. This enables using more heads within the same
computational budget, allowing higher specialization. We show that among the
tested sparse attention variants, MoSA is the only one that can outperform the
dense baseline, sometimes with up to 27% better perplexity for an identical
compute budget. MoSA can also reduce the resource usage compared to dense
self-attention. Despite using torch implementation without an optimized kernel,
perplexity-matched MoSA models are simultaneously faster in wall-clock time,
require less memory for training, and drastically reduce the size of the
KV-cache compared to the dense transformer baselines.

TL;DR: 使用U-Net架构的卷积神经网络（CNN）替代模型加速了Cellular-Potts模型（CPM）的模拟，提升了590倍的计算速度，并成功捕捉了血管生成的关键行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CPM模拟计算成本高，限制了其在复杂生物系统研究中的应用，需要一种高效替代方法。

Method: 开发了基于U-Net的CNN模型，考虑周期性边界条件，用于预测CPM的100步计算。

Result: 替代模型加速了590倍，成功模拟了血管生成的关键行为，如血管延伸和吻合。

Conclusion: 深度学习可作为高效替代模型，加速CPM模拟，拓展其在大规模时空研究中的应用。

Abstract: The Cellular-Potts model is a powerful and ubiquitous framework for
developing computational models for simulating complex multicellular biological
systems. Cellular-Potts models (CPMs) are often computationally expensive due
to the explicit modeling of interactions among large numbers of individual
model agents and diffusive fields described by partial differential equations
(PDEs). In this work, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) surrogate
model using a U-Net architecture that accounts for periodic boundary
conditions. We use this model to accelerate the evaluation of a mechanistic CPM
previously used to investigate \textit{in vitro} vasculogenesis. The surrogate
model was trained to predict 100 computational steps ahead (Monte-Carlo steps,
MCS), accelerating simulation evaluations by a factor of 590 times compared to
CPM code execution. Over multiple recursive evaluations, our model effectively
captures the emergent behaviors demonstrated by the original Cellular-Potts
model of such as vessel sprouting, extension and anastomosis, and contraction
of vascular lacunae. This approach demonstrates the potential for deep learning
to serve as efficient surrogate models for CPM simulations, enabling faster
evaluation of computationally expensive CPM of biological processes at greater
spatial and temporal scales.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SteinSense的轻量级迭代算法，用于高维向量恢复，优于传统的凸优化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代科技趋势倾向于高维向量测量，传统凸优化方法在向量恢复中表现不佳，尤其是在高维情况下。

Method: SteinSense是一种无需调参、无需训练数据、无需稀疏性知识的简单迭代算法。

Result: 大量实验证实SteinSense在高维向量恢复中表现优异，且对实际数据具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SteinSense是一种高效、简单且可扩展的高维向量恢复方法，优于传统凸优化方法。

Abstract: The trend in modern science and technology is to take vector measurements
rather than scalars, ruthlessly scaling to ever higher dimensional vectors. For
about two decades now, traditional scalar Compressed Sensing has been
synonymous with a Convex Optimization based procedure called Basis Pursuit. In
the vector recovery case, the natural tendency is to return to a
straightforward vector extension of Basis Pursuit, also based on Convex
Optimization. However, Convex Optimization is provably suboptimal, particularly
when $B$ is large. In this paper, we propose SteinSense, a lightweight
iterative algorithm, which is provably optimal when $B$ is large. It does not
have any tuning parameter, does not need any training data, requires zero
knowledge of sparsity, is embarrassingly simple to implement, and all of this
makes it easily scalable to high vector dimensions. We conduct a massive volume
of both real and synthetic experiments that confirm the efficacy of SteinSense,
and also provide theoretical justification based on ideas from Approximate
Message Passing. Fascinatingly, we discover that SteinSense is quite robust,
delivering the same quality of performance on real data, and even under
substantial departures from conditions under which existing theory holds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer大模型在联邦学习中微调时面临资源限制和通信开销的挑战，需要一种高效的方法。

Method: 提出无线联邦LoRA框架，结合稀疏正交微调（SOFT）和两阶段联邦算法（TSFA），优化参数更新和带宽调整。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持高精度的同时显著减少通信开销。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模模型在无线联邦学习中的高效部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
success across various tasks. Yet, fine-tuning such massive models in federated
learning (FL) settings poses significant challenges due to resource constraints
and communication overhead. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) addresses these issues
by training compact, low-rank matrices instead of fully fine-tuning large
models. This paper introduces a wireless federated LoRA fine-tuning framework
that optimizes both learning performance and communication efficiency. We
provide a novel convergence analysis, revealing how LoRA rank and covariance
effects influence FL training dynamics. Leveraging these insights, we propose
Sparsified Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (\textbf{SOFT}), an adaptive sparsification
method that streamlines parameter updates without expensive matrix
multiplications and singular value decomposition (SVD) operations.
Additionally, we present a Two Stage Federated Algorithm (\textbf{TSFA})
algorithm that pre-determines key parameters offline and dynamically adjusts
bandwidth and sparsification online, ensuring efficient training under latency
constraints. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach achieves
accuracy comparable to ideal scenario models while significantly reducing
communication overhead. Our framework thus enables scalable, resource-efficient
deployment of large models in real-world wireless FL scenarios.

Motivation: 当前文本到视频生成模型虽能生成高质量视频，但常违反物理定律，缺乏系统性评估。

Method: 提出T2VPhysBench基准，结合人类评估和物理定律测试，包括总体合规性、提示消融和反事实鲁棒性研究。

Result: 所有模型在物理定律上的平均得分低于0.60，详细提示也无法改善违反物理定律的情况。

Conclusion: 现有模型在物理感知上存在局限，需进一步研究改进。

Abstract: Text-to-video generative models have made significant strides in recent
years, producing high-quality videos that excel in both aesthetic appeal and
accurate instruction following, and have become central to digital art creation
and user engagement online. Yet, despite these advancements, their ability to
respect fundamental physical laws remains largely untested: many outputs still
violate basic constraints such as rigid-body collisions, energy conservation,
and gravitational dynamics, resulting in unrealistic or even misleading
content. Existing physical-evaluation benchmarks typically rely on automatic,
pixel-level metrics applied to simplistic, life-scenario prompts, and thus
overlook both human judgment and first-principles physics. To fill this gap, we
introduce \textbf{T2VPhysBench}, a first-principled benchmark that
systematically evaluates whether state-of-the-art text-to-video systems, both
open-source and commercial, obey twelve core physical laws including Newtonian
mechanics, conservation principles, and phenomenological effects. Our benchmark
employs a rigorous human evaluation protocol and includes three targeted
studies: (1) an overall compliance assessment showing that all models score
below 0.60 on average in each law category; (2) a prompt-hint ablation
revealing that even detailed, law-specific hints fail to remedy physics
violations; and (3) a counterfactual robustness test demonstrating that models
often generate videos that explicitly break physical rules when so instructed.
The results expose persistent limitations in current architectures and offer
concrete insights for guiding future research toward truly physics-aware video
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型规模增长导致的训练/微调成本过高问题，尤其是状态优化器的内存开销问题。

Method: 采用超低精度量化（2-3位），针对无符号量化中的信号淹没问题和有符号量化中的梯度方差问题，提出对数量化和特定动量值解决方案。

Result: SOLO显著节省内存（约45GB），且准确性损失极小。

Conclusion: SOLO有望突破计算资源瓶颈，推动基础研究的普及。

Abstract: The explosion in model sizes leads to continued growth in prohibitive
training/fine-tuning costs, particularly for stateful optimizers which maintain
auxiliary information of even 2x the model size to achieve optimal convergence.
We therefore present in this work a novel type of optimizer that carries with
extremely lightweight state overloads, achieved through ultra-low-precision
quantization. While previous efforts have achieved certain success with 8-bit
or 4-bit quantization, our approach enables optimizers to operate at precision
as low as 3 bits, or even 2 bits per state element. This is accomplished by
identifying and addressing two critical challenges: the signal swamping problem
in unsigned quantization that results in unchanged state dynamics, and the
rapidly increased gradient variance in signed quantization that leads to
incorrect descent directions. The theoretical analysis suggests a tailored
logarithmic quantization for the former and a precision-specific momentum value
for the latter. Consequently, the proposed SOLO achieves substantial memory
savings (approximately 45 GB when training a 7B model) with minimal accuracy
loss. We hope that SOLO can contribute to overcoming the bottleneck in
computational resources, thereby promoting greater accessibility in fundamental
research.

Abstract: Accurate household electrical energy demand prediction is essential for
effectively managing sustainable Energy Communities. Integrated with the Energy
Management System, these communities aim to optimise operational costs.
However, most existing forecasting models are region-specific and depend on
large datasets, limiting their applicability across different climates and
geographical areas. These models often lack flexibility and may not perform
well in regions with limited historical data, leading to inaccurate
predictions. This paper proposes a global model for 24-hour-ahead hourly
electrical energy demand prediction that is designed to perform effectively
across diverse climate conditions and datasets. The model's efficiency is
demonstrated using data from two distinct regions: Ireland, with a maritime
climate and Vietnam, with a tropical climate. Remarkably, the model achieves
high accuracy even with a limited dataset spanning only nine months. Its
robustness is further validated across different seasons in Ireland (summer and
winter) and Vietnam (dry and wet). The proposed model is evaluated against
state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning methods. Simulation results
indicate that the model consistently outperforms benchmark models, showcasing
its capability to provide reliable forecasts globally, regardless of varying
climatic conditions and data availability. This research underscores the
model's potential to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of Energy
Communities worldwide. The proposed model achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage
Error of 8.0% and 4.0% on the full Irish and Vietnamese datasets.

Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices
necessitates effective model com- pression strategies that judiciously balance
the reduction of model size with the preservation of performance. This study
introduces a novel safety-driven quantization framework that leverages
preservation sets to systematically prune and quantize neural network weights,
thereby optimizing model complexity without compromising accuracy. The proposed
methodology is rigorously evaluated on both a convolutional neural network
(CNN) and an attention-based language model, demonstrating its applicability
across diverse architectural paradigms. Experimental results reveal that our
framework achieves up to a 2.5% enhancement in test accuracy relative to the
original unquantized models while maintaining 60% of the initial model size. In
comparison to conventional quantization techniques, our approach not only
augments generalization by eliminating parameter noise and retaining essential
weights but also reduces variance, thereby ensuring the retention of critical
model features. These findings underscore the efficacy of safety-driven
quantization as a robust and reliable strategy for the efficient optimization
of deep learn- ing models. The implementation and comprehensive experimental
evaluations of our framework are publicly accessible at GitHub.

Motivation: 现有数据混合方法依赖预定领域且计算成本高，无法捕捉语义细节。

Result: R&B在五种数据集上表现优异，仅需0.01%额外计算开销即可匹配或超越现有方法。

Conclusion: R&B是一种高效且低成本的数据混合策略，优于非自适应方法。

Abstract: Data mixing strategies have successfully reduced the costs involved in
training language models. While promising, such methods suffer from two flaws.
First, they rely on predetermined data domains (e.g., data sources, task
types), which may fail to capture critical semantic nuances, leaving
performance on the table. Second, these methods scale with the number of
domains in a computationally prohibitive way. We address these challenges via
R&B, a framework that re-partitions training data based on semantic similarity
(Regroup) to create finer-grained domains, and efficiently optimizes the data
composition (Balance) by leveraging a Gram matrix induced by domain gradients
obtained throughout training. Unlike prior works, it removes the need for
additional compute to obtain evaluation information such as losses or
gradients. We analyze this technique under standard regularity conditions and
provide theoretical insights that justify R&B's effectiveness compared to
non-adaptive mixing approaches. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness
of R&B on five diverse datasets ranging from natural language to reasoning and
multimodal tasks. With as little as 0.01% additional compute overhead, R&B
matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art data mixing strategies.

Conclusion: TNStream为多密度、高维数据流聚类提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: In data stream clustering, systematic theory of stream clustering algorithms
remains relatively scarce. Recently, density-based methods have gained
attention. However, existing algorithms struggle to simultaneously handle
arbitrarily shaped, multi-density, high-dimensional data while maintaining
strong outlier resistance. Clustering quality significantly deteriorates when
data density varies complexly. This paper proposes a clustering algorithm based
on the novel concept of Tightest Neighbors and introduces a data stream
clustering theory based on the Skeleton Set. Based on these theories, this
paper develops a new method, TNStream, a fully online algorithm. The algorithm
adaptively determines the clustering radius based on local similarity,
summarizing the evolution of multi-density data streams in micro-clusters. It
then applies a Tightest Neighbors-based clustering algorithm to form final
clusters. To improve efficiency in high-dimensional cases, Locality-Sensitive
Hashing (LSH) is employed to structure micro-clusters, addressing the challenge
of storing k-nearest neighbors. TNStream is evaluated on various synthetic and
real-world datasets using different clustering metrics. Experimental results
demonstrate its effectiveness in improving clustering quality for multi-density
data and validate the proposed data stream clustering theory.

Conclusion: TIF提供了一种灵活的多粒度可解释框架，适用于复杂图分类任务。

Abstract: Interpretable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) aim to reveal the underlying
reasoning behind model predictions, attributing their decisions to specific
subgraphs that are informative. However, existing subgraph-based interpretable
methods suffer from an overemphasis on local structure, potentially overlooking
long-range dependencies within the entire graphs. Although recent efforts that
rely on graph coarsening have proven beneficial for global interpretability,
they inevitably reduce the graphs to a fixed granularity. Such an inflexible
way can only capture graph connectivity at a specific level, whereas real-world
graph tasks often exhibit relationships at varying granularities (e.g.,
relevant interactions in proteins span from functional groups, to amino acids,
and up to protein domains). In this paper, we introduce a novel Tree-like
Interpretable Framework (TIF) for graph classification, where plain GNNs are
transformed into hierarchical trees, with each level featuring coarsened graphs
of different granularity as tree nodes. Specifically, TIF iteratively adopts a
graph coarsening module to compress original graphs (i.e., root nodes of trees)
into increasingly coarser ones (i.e., child nodes of trees), while preserving
diversity among tree nodes within different branches through a dedicated graph
perturbation module. Finally, we propose an adaptive routing module to identify
the most informative root-to-leaf paths, providing not only the final
prediction but also the multi-granular interpretability for the decision-making
process. Extensive experiments on the graph classification benchmarks with both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of TIF in
interpretability, while also delivering a competitive prediction performance
akin to the state-of-the-art counterparts.

Conclusion: SacFL为资源受限设备提供了一种高效、自主的联邦持续学习解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The proliferation of end devices has led to a distributed computing paradigm,
wherein on-device machine learning models continuously process diverse data
generated by these devices. The dynamic nature of this data, characterized by
continuous changes or data drift, poses significant challenges for on-device
models. To address this issue, continual learning (CL) is proposed, enabling
machine learning models to incrementally update their knowledge and mitigate
catastrophic forgetting. However, the traditional centralized approach to CL is
unsuitable for end devices due to privacy and data volume concerns. In this
context, federated continual learning (FCL) emerges as a promising solution,
preserving user data locally while enhancing models through collaborative
updates. Aiming at the challenges of limited storage resources for CL, poor
autonomy in task shift detection, and difficulty in coping with new adversarial
tasks in FCL scenario, we propose a novel FCL framework named SacFL. SacFL
employs an Encoder-Decoder architecture to separate task-robust and
task-sensitive components, significantly reducing storage demands by retaining
lightweight task-sensitive components for resource-constrained end devices.
Moreover, $\rm{SacFL}$ leverages contrastive learning to introduce an
autonomous data shift detection mechanism, enabling it to discern whether a new
task has emerged and whether it is a benign task. This capability ultimately
allows the device to autonomously trigger CL or attack defense strategy without
additional information, which is more practical for end devices. Comprehensive
experiments conducted on multiple text and image datasets, such as Cifar100 and
THUCNews, have validated the effectiveness of $\rm{SacFL}$ in both
class-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios. Furthermore, a demo system
has been developed to verify its practicality.

<details>

Motivation: 准确估计包裹送达时间对物流行业至关重要，尤其是在混合物流场景中，取件对快递员决策行为的影响更大，但现有研究未能充分关注这一点。

Method: 采用Transformer编码器架构捕捉快递员历史路线和待派包裹的时空依赖，设计模式记忆模块通过注意力机制学习取件模式，并将路线预测作为辅助任务。

Result: 在真实工业规模数据集上的实验证明了方法的优越性，TransPDT系统已在京东物流内部部署，每日跟踪2000多名快递员处理数十万包裹。

Conclusion: TransPDT通过多任务学习和时空依赖建模，有效提升了混合物流场景中的包裹送达时间预测准确性。

Abstract: Accurately estimating package delivery time is essential to the logistics
industry, which enables reasonable work allocation and on-time service
guarantee. This becomes even more necessary in mixed logistics scenarios where
couriers handle a high volume of delivery and a smaller number of pickup
simultaneously. However, most of the related works treat the pickup and
delivery patterns on couriers' decision behavior equally, neglecting that the
pickup has a greater impact on couriers' decision-making compared to the
delivery due to its tighter time constraints. In such context, we have three
main challenges: 1) multiple spatiotemporal factors are intricately
interconnected, significantly affecting couriers' delivery behavior; 2) pickups
have stricter time requirements but are limited in number, making it
challenging to model their effects on couriers' delivery process; 3) couriers'
spatial mobility patterns are critical determinants of their delivery behavior,
but have been insufficiently explored. To deal with these, we propose TransPDT,
a Transformer-based multi-task package delivery time prediction model. We first
employ the Transformer encoder architecture to capture the spatio-temporal
dependencies of couriers' historical travel routes and pending package sets.
Then we design the pattern memory to learn the patterns of pickup in the
imbalanced dataset via attention mechanism. We also set the route prediction as
an auxiliary task of delivery time prediction, and incorporate the prior
courier spatial movement regularities in prediction. Extensive experiments on
real industry-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. A
system based on TransPDT is deployed internally in JD Logistics to track more
than 2000 couriers handling hundreds of thousands of packages per day in
Beijing.

Abstract: Despite the significant breakthroughs that the Deep Q-Network (DQN) has
brought to reinforcement learning, its theoretical analysis remains limited. In
this paper, we construct a stochastic differential delay equation (SDDE) based
on the DQN algorithm and estimate the Wasserstein-1 distance between them. We
provide an upper bound for the distance and prove that the distance between the
two converges to zero as the step size approaches zero. This result allows us
to understand DQN's two key techniques, the experience replay and the target
network, from the perspective of continuous systems. Specifically, the delay
term in the equation, corresponding to the target network, contributes to the
stability of the system. Our approach leverages a refined Lindeberg principle
and an operator comparison to establish these results.

TL;DR: 提出了首个在在线凸优化（OCO）中实现零约束违反的理论保证，适用于动态约束变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法允许偶尔违反约束，而本文旨在严格保持安全性，假设约束逐渐变化。

Method: 采用原始-对偶方法和对偶空间中的在线梯度上升，使用二分学习率确保安全性和次线性遗憾。

Result: 首次证明了在动态约束变化下保持绝对安全性的可行性。

Conclusion: 本文为OCO中动态约束下的严格安全性提供了首个理论框架。

Abstract: We present the first theoretical guarantees for zero constraint violation in
Online Convex Optimization (OCO) across all rounds, addressing dynamic
constraint changes. Unlike existing approaches in constrained OCO, which allow
for occasional safety breaches, we provide the first approach for maintaining
strict safety under the assumption of gradually evolving constraints, namely
the constraints change at most by a small amount between consecutive rounds.
This is achieved through a primal-dual approach and Online Gradient Ascent in
the dual space. We show that employing a dichotomous learning rate enables
ensuring both safety, via zero constraint violation, and sublinear regret. Our
framework marks a departure from previous work by providing the first provable
guarantees for maintaining absolute safety in the face of changing constraints
in OCO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DeepSTA的深度时空注意力模型，用于预测快递员的准时送达率，特别关注异常情况下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物流行业需要提前预测快递员的准时送达率以采取预防措施，尤其是在异常情况下（如疫情爆发），现有研究对此关注不足且未能明确建模异常事件。

Method: 设计了异常时空学习模块和异常模式注意力模块，结合Node2vec、图神经网络和LSTM捕获时空依赖关系。

Result: 在2022年COVID-19爆发期间的物流数据集上，模型在MAE和MSE上分别优于基线12.11%和13.71%。

Conclusion: DeepSTA在异常情况下表现出色，为物流行业提供了有效的预测工具。

Abstract: Prediction of couriers' delivery timely rates in advance is essential to the
logistics industry, enabling companies to take preemptive measures to ensure
the normal operation of delivery services. This becomes even more critical
during anomaly conditions like the epidemic outbreak, during which couriers'
delivery timely rate will decline markedly and fluctuates significantly.
Existing studies pay less attention to the logistics scenario. Moreover, many
works focusing on prediction tasks in anomaly scenarios fail to explicitly
model abnormal events, e.g., treating external factors equally with other
features, resulting in great information loss. Further, since some anomalous
events occur infrequently, traditional data-driven methods perform poorly in
these scenarios. To deal with them, we propose a deep spatial-temporal
attention model, named DeepSTA. To be specific, to avoid information loss, we
design an anomaly spatio-temporal learning module that employs a recurrent
neural network to model incident information. Additionally, we utilize Node2vec
to model correlations between road districts, and adopt graph neural networks
and long short-term memory to capture the spatial-temporal dependencies of
couriers. To tackle the issue of insufficient training data in abnormal
circumstances, we propose an anomaly pattern attention module that adopts a
memory network for couriers' anomaly feature patterns storage via attention
mechanisms. The experiments on real-world logistics datasets during the
COVID-19 outbreak in 2022 show the model outperforms the best baselines by
12.11% in MAE and 13.71% in MSE, demonstrating its superior performance over
multiple competitive baselines.

Motivation: 骨质疏松无症状且易被忽视，早期预测对预防骨折至关重要，需透明化的机器学习模型支持临床决策。

Method: 评估六种机器学习分类器，使用临床、人口和生活方式数据，通过GridSearchCV优化超参数，结合SHAP、LIME等XAI方法解释模型。

Result: XGBoost准确率最高（91%），年龄、激素变化和家族史是主要风险因素，结果与临床知识一致。

Conclusion: 可解释性对医疗AI至关重要，未来需验证多样本数据并整合更多生物标志物以提高预测精度。

Abstract: The present research tackles the difficulty of predicting osteoporosis risk
via machine learning (ML) approaches, emphasizing the use of explainable
artificial intelligence (XAI) to improve model transparency. Osteoporosis is a
significant public health concern, sometimes remaining untreated owing to its
asymptomatic characteristics, and early identification is essential to avert
fractures. The research assesses six machine learning classifiers: Random
Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, AdaBoost, LightGBM, and Gradient Boosting
and utilizes a dataset based on clinical, demographic, and lifestyle variables.
The models are refined using GridSearchCV to calibrate hyperparameters, with
the objective of enhancing predictive efficacy. XGBoost had the greatest
accuracy (91%) among the evaluated models, surpassing others in precision
(0.92), recall (0.91), and F1-score (0.90). The research further integrates XAI
approaches, such as SHAP, LIME, and Permutation Feature Importance, to
elucidate the decision-making process of the optimal model. The study indicates
that age is the primary determinant in forecasting osteoporosis risk, followed
by hormonal alterations and familial history. These results corroborate
clinical knowledge and affirm the models' therapeutic significance. The
research underscores the significance of explainability in machine learning
models for healthcare applications, guaranteeing that physicians can rely on
the system's predictions. The report ultimately proposes directions for further
research, such as validation across varied populations and the integration of
supplementary biomarkers for enhanced predictive accuracy.

Method: CICADA采用混合专家框架、选择性元学习、自适应扩展算法和分层注意力结构，提升跨域检测性能和可解释性。

Result: 实验表明，CICADA在合成和真实工业数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CICADA在跨域异常检测和可解释性方面取得了显著进展。

Abstract: Unsupervised Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in
applications across industries. However, existing methods face significant
challenges due to data distributional shifts across different domains, which
are exacerbated by the non-stationarity of time series over time. Existing
models fail to generalize under multiple heterogeneous source domains and
emerging unseen new target domains. To fill the research gap, we introduce
CICADA (Cross-domain Interpretable Coding for Anomaly Detection and
Adaptation), with four key innovations: (1) a mixture of experts (MOE)
framework that captures domain-agnostic anomaly features with high flexibility
and interpretability; (2) a novel selective meta-learning mechanism to prevent
negative transfer between dissimilar domains, (3) an adaptive expansion
algorithm for emerging heterogeneous domain expansion, and (4) a hierarchical
attention structure that quantifies expert contributions during fusion to
enhance interpretability further.Extensive experiments on synthetic and
real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that CICADA outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain detection performance and
interpretability.

Conclusion: 交叉注意力和自训练策略在多模态分类中具有互补优势，能有效提升有限监督下的泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate classification of medical device risk levels is essential for
regulatory oversight and clinical safety. We present a Transformer-based
multimodal framework that integrates textual descriptions and visual
information to predict device regulatory classification. The model incorporates
a cross-attention mechanism to capture intermodal dependencies and employs a
self-training strategy for improved generalization under limited supervision.
Experiments on a real-world regulatory dataset demonstrate that our approach
achieves up to 90.4% accuracy and 97.9% AUROC, significantly outperforming
text-only (77.2%) and image-only (54.8%) baselines. Compared to standard
multimodal fusion, the self-training mechanism improved SVM performance by 3.3
percentage points in accuracy (from 87.1% to 90.4%) and 1.4 points in macro-F1,
suggesting that pseudo-labeling can effectively enhance generalization under
limited supervision. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary
benefits of both cross-modal attention and self-training.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that successful per-domain generalizing action policies
can be learned. Scaling behavior, from small training instances to large test
instances, is the key objective; and the use of validation instances larger
than training instances is one key to achieve it. Prior work has used fixed
validation sets. Here, we introduce a method generating the validation set
dynamically, on the fly, increasing instance size so long as informative and
feasible.We also introduce refined methodology for evaluating scaling behavior,
generating test instances systematically to guarantee a given confidence in
coverage performance for each instance size. In experiments, dynamic validation
improves scaling behavior of GNN policies in all 9 domains used.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效统一了属性驱动机器学习方法，并开源实现。

Abstract: Neural networks have been shown to frequently fail to satisfy critical safety
and correctness properties after training, highlighting the pressing need for
training methods that incorporate such properties directly. While adversarial
training can be used to improve robustness to small perturbations within
$\epsilon$-cubes, domains other than computer vision -- such as control systems
and natural language processing -- may require more flexible input region
specifications via generalised hyper-rectangles. Meanwhile, differentiable
logics offer a way to encode arbitrary logical constraints as additional loss
terms that guide the learning process towards satisfying these constraints. In
this paper, we investigate how these two complementary approaches can be
unified within a single framework for property-driven machine learning. We show
that well-known properties from the literature are subcases of this general
approach, and we demonstrate its practical effectiveness on a case study
involving a neural network controller for a drone system. Our framework is
publicly available at https://github.com/tflinkow/property-driven-ml.

Result: 多输出Transformer能够准确预测非线性系统和高维参数空间下的多输出序列，并通过注意力权重矩阵揭示了输出间的时空相关性。

Conclusion: 多输出Transformer在预测复杂动态系统输出方面表现出色，同时提供了对输出间交互的可解释性。

Abstract: We explore the promising performance of a transformer model in predicting
outputs of parametric dynamical systems with external time-varying input
signals. The outputs of such systems vary not only with physical parameters but
also with external time-varying input signals. Accurately catching the dynamics
of such systems is challenging. We have adapted and extended an existing
transformer model for single output prediction to a multiple-output transformer
that is able to predict multiple output responses of these systems. The
multiple-output transformer generalizes the interpretability of the original
transformer. The generalized interpretable attention weight matrix explores not
only the temporal correlations in the sequence, but also the interactions
between the multiple outputs, providing explanation for the spatial correlation
in the output domain. This multiple-output transformer accurately predicts the
sequence of multiple outputs, regardless of the nonlinearity of the system and
the dimensionality of the parameter space.

Conclusion: DASP通过密度感知的安全决策，显著提升了离线强化学习的性能。

Abstract: The performance of Offline reinforcement learning is significantly impacted
by the issue of state distributional shift, and out-of-distribution (OOD) state
correction is a popular approach to address this problem. In this paper, we
propose a novel method named Density-Aware Safety Perception (DASP) for OOD
state correction. Specifically, our method encourages the agent to prioritize
actions that lead to outcomes with higher data density, thereby promoting its
operation within or the return to in-distribution (safe) regions. To achieve
this, we optimize the objective within a variational framework that
concurrently considers both the potential outcomes of decision-making and their
density, thus providing crucial contextual information for safe
decision-making. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and feasibility of our
proposed method through extensive experimental evaluations on the offline
MuJoCo and AntMaze suites.

<details>

Motivation: 现有表示学习框架（如I-Con）通过固定邻域条件分布的KL散度统一学习范式，但忽视了学习过程中的递归结构。

Method: 提出RKDO，将表示学习建模为KL散度在数据邻域上的动态演化过程，涵盖对比学习、聚类和降维方法。

Result: 实验表明，RKDO在三个数据集上损失值降低约30%，计算资源节省60%-80%。

Conclusion: RKDO的递归更新机制为表示学习提供了更高效的优化路径，尤其适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: We propose a generalization of modern representation learning objectives by
reframing them as recursive divergence alignment processes over localized
conditional distributions While recent frameworks like Information Contrastive
Learning I-Con unify multiple learning paradigms through KL divergence between
fixed neighborhood conditionals we argue this view underplays a crucial
recursive structure inherent in the learning process. We introduce Recursive KL
Divergence Optimization RKDO a dynamic formalism where representation learning
is framed as the evolution of KL divergences across data neighborhoods. This
formulation captures contrastive clustering and dimensionality reduction
methods as static slices while offering a new path to model stability and local
adaptation. Our experiments demonstrate that RKDO offers dual efficiency
advantages approximately 30 percent lower loss values compared to static
approaches across three different datasets and 60 to 80 percent reduction in
computational resources needed to achieve comparable results. This suggests
that RKDOs recursive updating mechanism provides a fundamentally more efficient
optimization landscape for representation learning with significant
implications for resource constrained applications.

Conclusion: 稀疏性与可解释性之间存在复杂关系，局部专业化而非全局稀疏性更有利于可解释性。

Abstract: A growing intuition in machine learning suggests a link between sparsity and
interpretability. We introduce a novel self-ablation mechanism to investigate
this connection ante-hoc in the context of language transformers. Our approach
dynamically enforces a k-winner-takes-all constraint, forcing the model to
demonstrate selective activation across neuron and attention units. Unlike
post-hoc methods that analyze already-trained models, our approach integrates
interpretability directly into model training, promoting feature localization
from inception. Training small models on the TinyStories dataset and employing
interpretability tests, we find that self-ablation leads to more localized
circuits, concentrated feature representations, and increased neuron
specialization without compromising language modelling performance.
Surprisingly, our method also decreased overall sparsity, indicating that
self-ablation promotes specialization rather than widespread inactivity. This
reveals a complex interplay between sparsity and interpretability, where
decreased global sparsity can coexist with increased local specialization,
leading to enhanced interpretability. To facilitate reproducibility, we make
our code available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL算法在药物发现中缺乏稳健的探索机制，导致灾难性遗忘问题，即预训练知识（如分子有效性）在RL阶段显著退化。

Method: PSV-PPO在每一步自回归生成时进行部分SMILES验证，评估当前候选标记及其潜在分支，早期检测无效结构。

Result: 在PMO和GuacaMol数据集上，PSV-PPO显著减少了无效结构生成，同时保持探索和优化性能。

Conclusion: PSV-PPO框架可扩展以纳入更多领域知识，进一步推动药物发现中的强化学习应用。

Abstract: SMILES-based molecule generation has emerged as a powerful approach in drug
discovery. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) using large language model (LLM)
has been incorporated into the molecule generation process to achieve high
matching score in term of likelihood of desired molecule candidates. However, a
critical challenge in this approach is catastrophic forgetting during the RL
phase, where knowledge such as molecule validity, which often exceeds 99\%
during pretraining, significantly deteriorates. Current RL algorithms applied
in drug discovery, such as REINVENT, use prior models as anchors to retian
pretraining knowledge, but these methods lack robust exploration mechanisms. To
address these issues, we propose Partial SMILES Validation-PPO (PSV-PPO), a
novel RL algorithm that incorporates real-time partial SMILES validation to
prevent catastrophic forgetting while encouraging exploration. Unlike
traditional RL approaches that validate molecule structures only after
generating entire sequences, PSV-PPO performs stepwise validation at each
auto-regressive step, evaluating not only the selected token candidate but also
all potential branches stemming from the prior partial sequence. This enables
early detection of invalid partial SMILES across all potential paths. As a
result, PSV-PPO maintains high validity rates even during aggressive
exploration of the vast chemical space. Our experiments on the PMO and GuacaMol
benchmark datasets demonstrate that PSV-PPO significantly reduces the number of
invalid generated structures while maintaining competitive exploration and
optimization performance. While our work primarily focuses on maintaining
validity, the framework of PSV-PPO can be extended in future research to
incorporate additional forms of valuable domain knowledge, further enhancing
reinforcement learning applications in drug discovery.

Conclusion: TCA方法通过相关性对齐和高效设计，显著提升了测试时适应的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often experience performance drops due to distribution
shifts between training and test data. Although domain adaptation offers a
solution, privacy concerns restrict access to training data in many real-world
scenarios. This restriction has spurred interest in Test-Time Adaptation (TTA),
which adapts models using only unlabeled test data. However, current TTA
methods still face practical challenges: (1) a primary focus on instance-wise
alignment, overlooking CORrelation ALignment (CORAL) due to missing source
correlations; (2) complex backpropagation operations for model updating,
resulting in overhead computation and (3) domain forgetting.
  To address these challenges, we provide a theoretical analysis to investigate
the feasibility of Test-time Correlation Alignment (TCA), demonstrating that
correlation alignment between high-certainty instances and test instances can
enhance test performances with a theoretical guarantee. Based on this, we
propose two simple yet effective algorithms: LinearTCA and LinearTCA+.
LinearTCA applies a simple linear transformation to achieve both instance and
correlation alignment without additional model updates, while LinearTCA+ serves
as a plug-and-play module that can easily boost existing TTA methods. Extensive
experiments validate our theoretical insights and show that TCA methods
significantly outperforms baselines across various tasks, benchmarks and
backbones. Notably, LinearTCA improves adaptation accuracy by 5.88% on
OfficeHome dataset, while using only 4% maximum GPU memory usage and 0.6%
computation time compared to the best baseline TTA method.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a method of recording brain activity that
shows significant promise in applications ranging from disease classification
to emotion detection and brain-computer interfaces. Recent advances in deep
learning have improved EEG classification performance yet model explainability
remains an issue. To address this key limitation of explainability we introduce
KnowEEG; a novel explainable machine learning approach for EEG classification.
KnowEEG extracts a comprehensive set of per-electrode features, filters them
using statistical tests, and integrates between-electrode connectivity
statistics. These features are then input to our modified Random Forest model
(Fusion Forest) that balances per electrode statistics with between electrode
connectivity features in growing the trees of the forest. By incorporating
knowledge from both the generalized time-series and EEG-specific domains,
KnowEEG achieves performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art deep
learning models across five different classification tasks: emotion detection,
mental workload classification, eyes open/closed detection, abnormal EEG
classification, and event detection. In addition to high performance, KnowEEG
provides inherent explainability through feature importance scores for
understandable features. We demonstrate by example on the eyes closed/open
classification task that this explainability can be used to discover knowledge
about the classes. This discovered knowledge for eyes open/closed
classification was proven to be correct by current neuroscience literature.
Therefore, the impact of KnowEEG will be significant for domains where EEG
explainability is critical such as healthcare.

Method: 提出DFBT方法，直接基于观测预测状态，避免逐步递归预测中的误差累积。

Result: 在D4RL和MuJoCo基准测试中，DFBT显著减少误差并超越现有方法。

Conclusion: DFBT通过直接预测状态和促进多步引导，提高了学习效率和性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with delays is challenging as sensory perceptions
lag behind the actual events: the RL agent needs to estimate the real state of
its environment based on past observations. State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
typically employ recursive, step-by-step forecasting of states. This can cause
the accumulation of compounding errors. To tackle this problem, our novel
belief estimation method, named Directly Forecasting Belief Transformer (DFBT),
directly forecasts states from observations without incrementally estimating
intermediate states step-by-step. We theoretically demonstrate that DFBT
greatly reduces compounding errors of existing recursively forecasting methods,
yielding stronger performance guarantees. In experiments with D4RL offline
datasets, DFBT reduces compounding errors with remarkable prediction accuracy.
DFBT's capability to forecast state sequences also facilitates multi-step
bootstrapping, thus greatly improving learning efficiency. On the MuJoCo
benchmark, our DFBT-based method substantially outperforms SOTA baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过分解交错循环和对角矩阵进一步降低傅里叶域训练复杂性的方法，减少了计算量和可训练参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型计算和存储复杂度高，难以微调且实用性受限。

Method: 通过交错循环和对角矩阵的乘积分解，处理非方形微调权重，避免构建权重变化矩阵，使用1D FFT替代2D FFT。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种任务中性能相当或更好，同时显著减少FLOPs和可训练参数。

Conclusion: 该方法有效降低了傅里叶域训练的复杂性，提升了实用性。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved tremendous success in different domains.
However, their huge computation and storage complexity make these models
difficult to fine-tune and also less applicable in practice. Recent study shows
training in Fourier domain can be an effective fine-tuning method in terms of
both model performance and number of training parameters. In this work, we
propose to further reduce the complexity by the factorization through the
product of interleaved circulant and diagonal matrices. In addition, we address
the case of non-square fine-tuning weights by partitioning the circulant matrix
into blocks. Our method avoids the construction of weight change matrix and
utilizes 1D fast Fourier transform (FFT) instead of 2D FFT. Experimental
results show that our method achieves similar or better performance across
various tasks with much less floating-point operations (FLOPs) and the number
of trainable parameters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AiT的新模型，用于处理不规则多元时间序列的预测问题，通过自适应线性网络和Transformer模块提升建模精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注规则采样的多元时间序列，而实际应用中常遇到采样间隔不规则和缺失值的问题，传统线性网络难以有效建模。

Method: AiT结合自适应线性网络（动态调整权重）和Transformer模块（捕捉变量相关性），解决序列内不一致和序列间异步问题。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，AiT预测精度提升11%，运行时间减少52%。

Conclusion: AiT在处理不规则多元时间序列时表现出显著优势，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Time series forecasting holds significant importance across various
industries, including finance, transportation, energy, healthcare, and climate.
Despite the widespread use of linear networks due to their low computational
cost and effectiveness in modeling temporal dependencies, most existing
research has concentrated on regularly sampled and fully observed multivariate
time series. However, in practice, we frequently encounter irregular
multivariate time series characterized by variable sampling intervals and
missing values. The inherent intra-series inconsistency and inter-series
asynchrony in such data hinder effective modeling and forecasting with
traditional linear networks relying on static weights. To tackle these
challenges, this paper introduces a novel model named AiT. AiT utilizes an
adaptive linear network capable of dynamically adjusting weights according to
observation time points to address intra-series inconsistency, thereby
enhancing the accuracy of temporal dependencies modeling. Furthermore, by
incorporating the Transformer module on variable semantics embeddings, AiT
efficiently captures variable correlations, avoiding the challenge of
inter-series asynchrony. Comprehensive experiments across four benchmark
datasets demonstrate the superiority of AiT, improving prediction accuracy by
11% and decreasing runtime by 52% compared to existing state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: 空间分析中机器学习方法的黑箱特性限制了模型行为的理解，XAI通过增强透明度和解释性解决了这一问题。

Method: 介绍了XAI的关键概念和方法，特别是Shapley值，并将其与空间分析结合，通过实证案例与多尺度地理加权回归进行比较。

Result: 展示了Shapley值在空间分析中的实际应用效果，并验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 讨论了当前XAI技术的挑战和局限性，并提出了未来发展方向。

Abstract: This chapter discusses the opportunities of eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) within the realm of spatial analysis. A key objective in
spatial analysis is to model spatial relationships and infer spatial processes
to generate knowledge from spatial data, which has been largely based on
spatial statistical methods. More recently, machine learning offers scalable
and flexible approaches that complement traditional methods and has been
increasingly applied in spatial data science. Despite its advantages, machine
learning is often criticized for being a black box, which limits our
understanding of model behavior and output. Recognizing this limitation, XAI
has emerged as a pivotal field in AI that provides methods to explain the
output of machine learning models to enhance transparency and understanding.
These methods are crucial for model diagnosis, bias detection, and ensuring the
reliability of results obtained from machine learning models. This chapter
introduces key concepts and methods in XAI with a focus on Shapley value-based
approaches, which is arguably the most popular XAI method, and their
integration with spatial analysis. An empirical example of county-level voting
behaviors in the 2020 Presidential election is presented to demonstrate the use
of Shapley values and spatial analysis with a comparison to multi-scale
geographically weighted regression. The chapter concludes with a discussion on
the challenges and limitations of current XAI techniques and proposes new
directions.

Conclusion: GERM为GFMs的对抗脆弱性提供了系统分析工具，揭示了模型设计和生物学特征的重要性。

Abstract: We propose the first unified adversarial attack benchmark for Genomic
Foundation Models (GFMs), named GERM. Unlike existing GFM benchmarks, GERM
offers the first comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess
the vulnerability of GFMs to adversarial attacks. Methodologically, we evaluate
the adversarial robustness of five state-of-the-art GFMs using four widely
adopted attack algorithms and three defense strategies. Importantly, our
benchmark provides an accessible and comprehensive framework to analyze GFM
vulnerabilities with respect to model architecture, quantization schemes, and
training datasets. Empirically, transformer-based models exhibit greater
robustness to adversarial perturbations compared to HyenaDNA, highlighting the
impact of architectural design on vulnerability. Moreover, adversarial attacks
frequently target biologically significant genomic regions, suggesting that
these models effectively capture meaningful sequence features.

Result: 在TCGA BRCA数据集中发现临床相关聚类，生存预测表现优异。

Conclusion: 对比学习框架在多组学数据中具有发现生物学意义的潜力。

Abstract: Unsupervised learning of disease subtypes from multi-omics data presents a
significant opportunity for advancing personalized medicine. We introduce
OmicsCL, a modular contrastive learning framework that jointly embeds
heterogeneous omics modalities-such as gene expression, DNA methylation, and
miRNA expression-into a unified latent space. Our method incorporates a
survival-aware contrastive loss that encourages the model to learn
representations aligned with survival-related patterns, without relying on
labeled outcomes. Evaluated on the TCGA BRCA dataset, OmicsCL uncovers
clinically meaningful clusters and achieves strong unsupervised concordance
with patient survival. The framework demonstrates robustness across
hyperparameter configurations and can be tuned to prioritize either subtype
coherence or survival stratification. Ablation studies confirm that integrating
survival-aware loss significantly enhances the predictive power of learned
embeddings. These results highlight the promise of contrastive objectives for
biological insight discovery in high-dimensional, heterogeneous omics data.

Motivation: 解决连续动作空间中强化学习的问题，结合确定性策略梯度和经典策略梯度的优势。

Method: 基于Wasserstein梯度流的近似，推导出简单通用的闭式更新方法。

Result: 在DeepMind Control Suite和磁约束聚变任务中表现优于现有连续控制方法。

Conclusion: WPO是一种高效且通用的连续动作空间强化学习算法。

Abstract: We introduce Wasserstein Policy Optimization (WPO), an actor-critic algorithm
for reinforcement learning in continuous action spaces. WPO can be derived as
an approximation to Wasserstein gradient flow over the space of all policies
projected into a finite-dimensional parameter space (e.g., the weights of a
neural network), leading to a simple and completely general closed-form update.
The resulting algorithm combines many properties of deterministic and classic
policy gradient methods. Like deterministic policy gradients, it exploits
knowledge of the gradient of the action-value function with respect to the
action. Like classic policy gradients, it can be applied to stochastic policies
with arbitrary distributions over actions -- without using the
reparameterization trick. We show results on the DeepMind Control Suite and a
magnetic confinement fusion task which compare favorably with state-of-the-art
continuous control methods.

Motivation: 现有视频基准测试仅提供结果监督，缺乏中间推理步骤，难以评估模型是否真正结合了感知和时间信息进行推理。

Method: 创建了MINERVA数据集，包含多样化的视频领域和长度，以及复杂的多步问题，并提供详细的推理痕迹。

Result: 数据集对前沿开源和专有模型构成挑战，错误分析显示主要失败模式为时间定位和视觉感知错误。

Conclusion: MINERVA数据集填补了视频推理评估的空白，并揭示了模型在时间定位和视觉感知上的主要缺陷。

Abstract: Multimodal LLMs are turning their focus to video benchmarks, however most
video benchmarks only provide outcome supervision, with no intermediate or
interpretable reasoning steps. This makes it challenging to assess if models
are truly able to combine perceptual and temporal information to reason about
videos, or simply get the correct answer by chance or by exploiting linguistic
biases. To remedy this, we provide a new video reasoning dataset called MINERVA
for modern multimodal models. Each question in the dataset comes with 5 answer
choices, as well as detailed, hand-crafted reasoning traces. Our dataset is
multimodal, diverse in terms of video domain and length, and consists of
complex multi-step questions. Extensive benchmarking shows that our dataset
provides a challenge for frontier open-source and proprietary models. We
perform fine-grained error analysis to identify common failure modes across
various models, and create a taxonomy of reasoning errors. We use this to
explore both human and LLM-as-a-judge methods for scoring video reasoning
traces, and find that failure modes are primarily related to temporal
localization, followed by visual perception errors, as opposed to logical or
completeness errors. The dataset, along with questions, answer candidates and
reasoning traces will be publicly available under

Result: 实验表明正态归一化在泛化性能、模型鲁棒性等方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 正态归一化是一种有效的归一化方法，适用于多种模型和数据集。

Abstract: The normal distribution plays a central role in information theory - it is at
the same time the best-case signal and worst-case noise distribution, has the
greatest representational capacity of any distribution, and offers an
equivalence between uncorrelatedness and independence for joint distributions.
Accounting for the mean and variance of activations throughout the layers of
deep neural networks has had a significant effect on facilitating their
effective training, but seldom has a prescription for precisely what
distribution these activations should take, and how this might be achieved,
been offered. Motivated by the information-theoretic properties of the normal
distribution, we address this question and concurrently present normality
normalization: a novel normalization layer which encourages normality in the
feature representations of neural networks using the power transform and
employs additive Gaussian noise during training. Our experiments
comprehensively demonstrate the effectiveness of normality normalization, in
regards to its generalization performance on an array of widely used model and
dataset combinations, its strong performance across various common factors of
variation such as model width, depth, and training minibatch size, its
suitability for usage wherever existing normalization layers are conventionally
used, and as a means to improving model robustness to random perturbations.

Motivation: 传统过渡态能量计算方法成本高，限制了复杂材料和反应网络的计算筛选。

Method: 使用高斯过程回归结合Wasserstein Weisfeiler-Lehman图核（WWL-GPR）预测过渡态能量，并通过训练集子采样构建模型集合以量化不确定性。

Result: WWL-GPR模型显著提高了预测准确性，比传统方法减少了一个数量级的误差，并成功筛选出有潜力的催化剂。

Conclusion: 结合机器学习、密度泛函理论和微动力学模型，为复杂反应催化剂设计提供了高效框架。

Abstract: Obtaining accurate transition state (TS) energies is a bottleneck in
computational screening of complex materials and reaction networks due to the
high cost of TS search methods and first-principles methods such as density
functional theory (DFT). Here we propose a machine learning (ML) model for
predicting TS energies based on Gaussian process regression with the
Wasserstein Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel (WWL-GPR). Applying the model to
predict adsorption and TS energies for the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS)
reaction on single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts, we show that it can
significantly improve the accuracy compared to traditional approaches based on
scaling relations or ML models without a graph representation. Further
benefitting from the low cost of model training, we train an ensemble of
WWL-GPR models to obtain uncertainties through subsampling of the training data
and show how these uncertainties propagate to turnover frequency (TOF)
predictions through the construction of an ensemble of microkinetic models.
Comparing the errors in model-based vs DFT-based TOF predictions, we show that
the WWL-GPR model reduces errors by almost an order of magnitude compared to
scaling relations. This demonstrates the critical impact of accurate energy
predictions on catalytic activity estimation. Finally, we apply our model to
screen new materials, identifying promising catalysts for RWGS. This work
highlights the power of combining advanced ML techniques with DFT and
microkinetic modeling for screening catalysts for complex reactions like RWGS,
providing a robust framework for future catalyst design.

Motivation: 解决高维向量嵌入在存储时的内存挑战，提升检索增强生成模型的实用性。

Method: 在MTEB基准上系统评估了量化（float16、int8、binary、float8）和降维（PCA、Kernel PCA、UMAP等）策略。

Result: float8量化实现4倍存储减少且性能损失<0.3%，结合PCA可达到8倍压缩，优于单独使用int8。

Conclusion: 提出一种可视化性能-存储权衡的方法，帮助在实际应用中根据内存限制选择最优配置。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation enhances language models by retrieving
relevant information from external knowledge bases, relying on high-dimensional
vector embeddings typically stored in float32 precision. However, storing these
embeddings at scale presents significant memory challenges. To address this
issue, we systematically investigate on MTEB benchmark two complementary
optimization strategies: quantization, evaluating standard formats (float16,
int8, binary) and low-bit floating-point types (float8), and dimensionality
reduction, assessing methods like PCA, Kernel PCA, UMAP, Random Projections and
Autoencoders. Our results show that float8 quantization achieves a 4x storage
reduction with minimal performance degradation (<0.3%), significantly
outperforming int8 quantization at the same compression level, being simpler to
implement. PCA emerges as the most effective dimensionality reduction
technique. Crucially, combining moderate PCA (e.g., retaining 50% dimensions)
with float8 quantization offers an excellent trade-off, achieving 8x total
compression with less performance impact than using int8 alone (which provides
only 4x compression). To facilitate practical application, we propose a
methodology based on visualizing the performance-storage trade-off space to
identify the optimal configuration that maximizes performance within their
specific memory constraints.

Motivation: 当前RAG基准主要基于公开数据（如维基百科），缺乏对私有和个人化数据的评估支持，限制了RAG在企业私有文档中的应用潜力。

Method: 通过发布EnronQA数据集（包含103,638封邮件和528,304个问答对），为私有数据上的RAG评估提供更真实的基准。

Conclusion: EnronQA填补了私有数据RAG评估的空白，并揭示了私有文档处理中记忆与检索的权衡关系。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has become one of the most popular
methods for bringing knowledge-intensive context to large language models (LLM)
because of its ability to bring local context at inference time without the
cost or data leakage risks associated with fine-tuning. A clear separation of
private information from the LLM training has made RAG the basis for many
enterprise LLM workloads as it allows the company to augment LLM's
understanding using customers' private documents. Despite its popularity for
private documents in enterprise deployments, current RAG benchmarks for
validating and optimizing RAG pipelines draw their corpora from public data
such as Wikipedia or generic web pages and offer little to no personal context.
Seeking to empower more personal and private RAG we release the EnronQA
benchmark, a dataset of 103,638 emails with 528,304 question-answer pairs
across 150 different user inboxes. EnronQA enables better benchmarking of RAG
pipelines over private data and allows for experimentation on the introduction
of personalized retrieval settings over realistic data. Finally, we use EnronQA
to explore the tradeoff in memorization and retrieval when reasoning over
private documents.

Conclusion: Task Arithmetic是一种有效的零样本学习和模型适应策略，兼具实用性和局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive zero-shot performance
across a variety of Natural Language Processing tasks, including document
re-ranking. However, their effectiveness degrades on unseen tasks and domains,
largely due to shifts in vocabulary and word distributions. In this paper, we
investigate Task Arithmetic, a technique that combines the weights of LLMs
pre-trained on different tasks or domains via simple mathematical operations,
such as addition or subtraction, to adapt retrieval models without requiring
additional fine-tuning. Our method is able to synthesize diverse tasks and
domain knowledge into a single model, enabling effective zero-shot adaptation
in different retrieval contexts. Extensive experiments on publicly available
scientific, biomedical, and multilingual datasets show that our method improves
state-of-the-art re-ranking performance by up to 18% in NDCG@10 and 15% in
P@10. In addition to these empirical gains, our analysis provides insights into
the strengths and limitations of Task Arithmetic as a practical strategy for
zero-shot learning and model adaptation. We make our code publicly available at

Conclusion: ChebyCF有效解决了传统方法的瓶颈，实现了先进的推荐性能。

Abstract: Graph convolutional networks have recently gained prominence in collaborative
filtering (CF) for recommendations. However, we identify potential bottlenecks
in two foundational components. First, the embedding layer leads to a latent
space with limited capacity, overlooking locally observed but potentially
valuable preference patterns. Also, the widely-used neighborhood aggregation is
limited in its ability to leverage diverse preference patterns in a
fine-grained manner. Building on spectral graph theory, we reveal that these
limitations stem from graph filtering with a cut-off in the frequency spectrum
and a restricted linear form. To address these issues, we introduce ChebyCF, a
CF framework based on graph spectral filtering. Instead of a learned embedding,
it takes a user's raw interaction history to utilize the full spectrum of
signals contained in it. Also, it adopts Chebyshev interpolation to effectively
approximate a flexible non-linear graph filter, and further enhances it by
using an additional ideal pass filter and degree-based normalization. Through
extensive experiments, we verify that ChebyCF overcomes the aforementioned
bottlenecks and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple
benchmarks and reasonably fast inference. Our code is available at

Motivation: 研究动机是探索匿名化技术对病理语音的感知影响，以支持伦理数据共享。

Method: 采用结构化感知协议，由10名母语和非母语德语听者对180名说话者的匿名化-原始语音对进行评估，完成图灵式辨别和质量评分任务。

Result: 匿名化显著降低语音质量（从83%降至59%），辨别准确率高（91%-93%），但效果因疾病类型不同。人类感知结果与自动隐私或临床效用指标无关。

Conclusion: 需开发针对疾病和语境的匿名化策略，以平衡隐私保护和语音质量，特别是对儿童等脆弱群体。

Abstract: Automatic anonymization techniques are essential for ethical sharing of
pathological speech data, yet their perceptual consequences remain
understudied. This study presents the first comprehensive human-centered
analysis of anonymized pathological speech, using a structured perceptual
protocol involving ten native and non-native German listeners with diverse
linguistic, clinical, and technical backgrounds. Listeners evaluated
anonymized-original utterance pairs from 180 speakers spanning Cleft Lip and
Palate, Dysarthria, Dysglossia, Dysphonia, and age-matched healthy controls.
Speech was anonymized using state-of-the-art automatic methods (equal error
rates in the range of 30-40%). Listeners completed Turing-style discrimination
and quality rating tasks under zero-shot (single-exposure) and few-shot
(repeated-exposure) conditions. Discrimination accuracy was high overall (91%
zero-shot; 93% few-shot), but varied by disorder (repeated-measures ANOVA:
p=0.007), ranging from 96% (Dysarthria) to 86% (Dysphonia). Anonymization
consistently reduced perceived quality (from 83% to 59%, p<0.001), with
pathology-specific degradation patterns (one-way ANOVA: p=0.005). Native
listeners rated original speech slightly higher than non-native listeners
(Delta=4%, p=0.199), but this difference nearly disappeared after anonymization
(Delta=1%, p=0.724). No significant gender-based bias was observed. Critically,
human perceptual outcomes did not correlate with automatic privacy or clinical
utility metrics. These results underscore the need for listener-informed,
disorder- and context-specific anonymization strategies that preserve privacy
while maintaining interpretability, communicative functions, and diagnostic
utility, especially for vulnerable populations such as children.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统INR方法在严格模型大小限制下难以重建高频细节，而高频细节在视频压缩中至关重要。

Method: 集成通用超分辨率网络，利用高频细节的低时间冗余性，将细节重建任务交给SR网络。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在重建质量上优于传统INR基线，同时保持相近的模型大小。

Conclusion: 该方法为INR视频压缩提供了更高效的解决方案，尤其适用于高频细节重建。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have garnered significant attention
for their ability to model complex signals across a variety of domains.
Recently, INR-based approaches have emerged as promising frameworks for neural
video compression. While conventional methods primarily focus on embedding
video content into compact neural networks for efficient representation, they
often struggle to reconstruct high-frequency details under stringent model size
constraints, which are critical in practical compression scenarios. To address
this limitation, we propose an INR-based video representation method that
integrates a general-purpose super-resolution (SR) network. Motivated by the
observation that high-frequency components exhibit low temporal redundancy
across frames, our method entrusts the reconstruction of fine details to the SR
network. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
conventional INR-based baselines in terms of reconstruction quality, while
maintaining comparable model sizes.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于脊髓神经根的新型配准方法，比传统基于椎间盘的方法更准确和可重复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脊髓功能MRI研究需要精确的脊髓水平定位，但传统基于椎间盘的配准方法因个体解剖学差异而存在局限性。

Method: 开发了一种利用背侧颈椎根分割并与PAM50脊髓模板非线性对齐的配准方法。

Result: 在多站点和多姿势数据集中验证了方法的优越性，任务功能MRI中激活簇数量和Z分数显著提高。

Conclusion: 基于根的方法提高了配准精度和可靠性，为脊髓神经影像的群体分析提供了更优的空间标准化。

Abstract: Spinal cord functional MRI studies require precise localization of spinal
levels for reliable voxelwise group analyses. Traditional template-based
registration of the spinal cord uses intervertebral discs for alignment.
However, substantial anatomical variability across individuals exists between
vertebral and spinal levels. This study proposes a novel registration approach
that leverages spinal nerve rootlets to improve alignment accuracy and
reproducibility across individuals. We developed a registration method
leveraging dorsal cervical rootlets segmentation and aligning them non-linearly
with the PAM50 spinal cord template. Validation was performed on a
multi-subject, multi-site dataset (n=267, 44 sites) and a multi-subject dataset
with various neck positions (n=10, 3 sessions). We further validated the method
on task-based functional MRI (n=23) to compare group-level activation maps
using rootlet-based registration to traditional disc-based methods.
Rootlet-based registration showed superior alignment across individuals
compared to the traditional disc-based method. Notably, rootlet positions were
more stable across neck positions. Group-level analysis of task-based
functional MRI using rootlet-based increased Z scores and activation cluster
size compared to disc-based registration (number of active voxels from 3292 to
7978). Rootlet-based registration enhances both inter- and intra-subject
anatomical alignment and yields better spatial normalization for group-level
fMRI analyses. Our findings highlight the potential of rootlet-based
registration to improve the precision and reliability of spinal cord
neuroimaging group analysis.

Motivation: 现有盲协调方法在3D图像中存在切片间异质性、图像质量不高及大域差距性能不足的问题，需要改进。

Method: 提出BlindHarmonyDiff框架，利用3D校正流从目标域图像重建原始图像，并通过多步长补丁训练和细化模块优化。

Result: 实验表明，BlindHarmonyDiff在协调多样源域图像到目标域时表现优于现有方法，下游任务验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: BlindHarmonyDiff是一种鲁棒且通用的盲协调方法，适用于多样MR扫描仪。

Abstract: Blind harmonization has emerged as a promising technique for MR image
harmonization to achieve scale-invariant representations, requiring only target
domain data (i.e., no source domain data necessary). However, existing methods
face limitations such as inter-slice heterogeneity in 3D, moderate image
quality, and limited performance for a large domain gap. To address these
challenges, we introduce BlindHarmonyDiff, a novel blind 3D harmonization
framework that leverages an edge-to-image model tailored specifically to
harmonization. Our framework employs a 3D rectified flow trained on target
domain images to reconstruct the original image from an edge map, then yielding
a harmonized image from the edge of a source domain image. We propose
multi-stride patch training for efficient 3D training and a refinement module
for robust inference by suppressing hallucination. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BlindHarmonyDiff outperforms prior arts by harmonizing diverse
source domain images to the target domain, achieving higher correspondence to
the target domain characteristics. Downstream task-based quality assessments
such as tissue segmentation and age prediction on diverse MR scanners further
confirm the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrate the capability of our
robust and generalizable blind harmonization.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出轻量级深度可分离扩张卷积网络（DSDCN）解决高光谱超分辨率问题，结合多尺度特征提取和自定义损失函数，性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱超分辨率因数据高维和样本稀缺而困难，现有方法依赖大模型或额外图像融合，不实用。

Method: 采用类似MobileNet的深度可分离卷积，加入扩张卷积融合块提取空间和光谱特征，自定义损失函数结合MSE、L2正则和光谱角损失。

Result: 在两个公开高光谱数据集上表现优异，适合实际应用。

Conclusion: DSDCN为高光谱超分辨率提供轻量高效解决方案，代码开源。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated highly competitive performance in
super-resolution (SR) for natural images by learning mappings from
low-resolution (LR) to high-resolution (HR) images. However, hyperspectral
super-resolution remains an ill-posed problem due to the high spectral
dimensionality of the data and the scarcity of available training samples.
Moreover, existing methods often rely on large models with a high number of
parameters or require the fusion with panchromatic or RGB images, both of which
are often impractical in real-world scenarios. Inspired by the MobileNet
architecture, we introduce a lightweight depthwise separable dilated
convolutional network (DSDCN) to address the aforementioned challenges.
Specifically, our model leverages multiple depthwise separable convolutions,
similar to the MobileNet architecture, and further incorporates a dilated
convolution fusion block to make the model more flexible for the extraction of
both spatial and spectral features. In addition, we propose a custom loss
function that combines mean squared error (MSE), an L2 norm
regularization-based constraint, and a spectral angle-based loss, ensuring the
preservation of both spectral and spatial details. The proposed model achieves
very competitive performance on two publicly available hyperspectral datasets,
making it well-suited for hyperspectral image super-resolution tasks. The

Abstract: Parkinsons Disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily
affects motor functions and can lead to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
dementia in its advanced stages. With approximately 10 million people diagnosed
globally 1 to 1.8 per 1,000 individuals, according to reports by the Japan

gait-based pose analysis, gait sensory data, handwriting analysis, speech test
data, Electroencephalography (EEG), and multimodal fusion techniques. Based on
over 347 articles from leading scientific databases, this review examines key
aspects such as data collection methods, settings, feature representations, and
system performance, with a focus on recognition accuracy and robustness. This
survey aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers, providing
actionable guidance for the development of next generation PD recognition
systems. By leveraging diverse data modalities and cutting-edge machine
learning paradigms, this work contributes to advancing the state of PD
diagnostics and improving patient care through innovative, multimodal
approaches.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的外体积去除（OVR）方法，通过深度学习模型消除实时动态MRI中的伪影，提高图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时动态MRI在心脏功能评估中至关重要，但高加速率下伪影问题严重，影响诊断质量。

Method: 使用复合时间图像估计外体积信号，训练深度学习模型去除伪影，结合物理驱动的DL方法重建图像。

Result: 在高加速率下，图像质量与临床基线图像相当，优于传统重建方法。

Conclusion: 该方法无需修改采集协议即可有效减少伪影，为高加速率实时MRI提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time (RT) dynamic MRI plays a vital role in capturing rapid
physiological processes, offering unique insights into organ motion and
function. Among these applications, RT cine MRI is particularly important for
functional assessment of the heart with high temporal resolution. RT imaging
enables free-breathing, ungated imaging of cardiac motion, making it a crucial
alternative for patients who cannot tolerate conventional breath-hold,
ECG-gated acquisitions. However, achieving high acceleration rates in RT cine
MRI is challenging due to aliasing artifacts from extra-cardiac tissues,
particularly at high undersampling factors. In this study, we propose a novel
outer volume removal (OVR) method to address this challenge by eliminating
aliasing contributions from non-cardiac regions in a post-processing framework.
Our approach estimates the outer volume signal for each timeframe using
composite temporal images from time-interleaved undersampling patterns, which
inherently contain pseudo-periodic ghosting artifacts. A deep learning (DL)
model is trained to identify and remove these artifacts, producing a clean
outer volume estimate that is subsequently subtracted from the corresponding
k-space data. The final reconstruction is performed with a physics-driven DL
(PD-DL) method trained using an OVR-specific loss function to restore high
spatio-temporal resolution images. Experimental results show that the proposed
method at high accelerations achieves image quality that is visually comparable
to clinical baseline images, while outperforming conventional reconstruction
techniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The proposed approach
provides a practical and effective solution for artifact reduction in RT cine
MRI without requiring acquisition modifications, offering a pathway to higher
acceleration rates while preserving diagnostic quality.

TL;DR: GuideSR是一种新型单步扩散图像超分辨率模型，通过双分支架构提升图像保真度，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散超分辨率方法通过VAE下采样输入会损害结构保真度，GuideSR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用双分支架构：引导分支保留高保真结构，扩散分支利用预训练潜在扩散模型提升感知质量。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优异，PSNR提升1.39dB，各项指标领先。

Conclusion: GuideSR在保持低计算成本的同时，实现了图像恢复的实用进步。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose GuideSR, a novel single-step diffusion-based image
super-resolution (SR) model specifically designed to enhance image fidelity.
Existing diffusion-based SR approaches typically adapt pre-trained generative
models to image restoration tasks by adding extra conditioning on a
VAE-downsampled representation of the degraded input, which often compromises
structural fidelity. GuideSR addresses this limitation by introducing a
dual-branch architecture comprising: (1) a Guidance Branch that preserves
high-fidelity structures from the original-resolution degraded input, and (2) a
Diffusion Branch, which a pre-trained latent diffusion model to enhance
perceptual quality. Unlike conventional conditioning mechanisms, our Guidance
Branch features a tailored structure for image restoration tasks, combining
Full Resolution Blocks (FRBs) with channel attention and an Image Guidance
Network (IGN) with guided attention. By embedding detailed structural
information directly into the restoration pipeline, GuideSR produces sharper
and more visually consistent results. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that GuideSR achieves state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining the low computational cost of single-step approaches, with up to
1.39dB PSNR gain on challenging real-world datasets. Our approach consistently
outperforms existing methods across various reference-based metrics including
PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, DISTS and FID, further representing a practical advancement
for real-world image restoration.

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解了传统方法在重负载下的资源分配瓶颈，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: To address the challenges of high resource dynamism and intensive task
concurrency in microservice systems, this paper proposes an adaptive resource
scheduling method based on the A3C reinforcement learning algorithm. The
scheduling problem is modeled as a Markov Decision Process, where policy and
value networks are jointly optimized to enable fine-grained resource allocation
under varying load conditions. The method incorporates an asynchronous
multi-threaded learning mechanism, allowing multiple agents to perform parallel
sampling and synchronize updates to the global network parameters. This design
improves both policy convergence efficiency and model stability. In the
experimental section, a real-world dataset is used to construct a scheduling
scenario. The proposed method is compared with several typical approaches
across multiple evaluation metrics, including task delay, scheduling success
rate, resource utilization, and convergence speed. The results show that the
proposed method delivers high scheduling performance and system stability in
multi-task concurrent environments. It effectively alleviates the resource
allocation bottlenecks faced by traditional methods under heavy load,
demonstrating its practical value for intelligent scheduling in microservice
systems.

Conclusion: SDE-AL框架在参数化物理模型中表现出高效性，为数据驱动ROM构建提供了新思路。

Abstract: In situations where the solution of a high-fidelity dynamical system needs to
be evaluated repeatedly, over a vast pool of parametric configurations and in
absence of access to the underlying governing equations, data-driven model
reduction techniques are preferable. We propose a novel active learning
approach to build a parametric data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) by
greedily picking the most important parameter samples from the parameter
domain. As a result, during the ROM construction phase, the number of
high-fidelity solutions dynamically grow in a principled fashion. The
high-fidelity solution snapshots are expressed in several parameter-specific
linear subspaces, with the help of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and
the relative distance between these subspaces is used as a guiding mechanism to
perform active learning. For successfully achieving this, we provide a distance
measure to evaluate the similarity between pairs of linear subspaces with
different dimensions, and also show that this distance measure is a metric. The
usability of the proposed subspace-distance-enabled active learning (SDE-AL)
framework is demonstrated by augmenting two existing non-intrusive
reduced-order modeling approaches, and providing their active-learning-driven
(ActLearn) extensions, namely, SDE-ActLearn-POD-KSNN, and SDE-ActLearn-POD-NN.
Furthermore, we report positive results for two parametric physical models,
highlighting the efficiency of the proposed SDE-AL approach.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have demonstrated an enormous utility of
deep learning approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for
materials science. These methods have emerged as powerful tools for
high-throughput prediction of material properties, offering a compelling
enhancement and alternative to traditional first-principles calculations. While
the community has predominantly focused on developing increasingly complex and
universal models to enhance predictive accuracy, such approaches often lack
physical interpretability and insights into materials behavior. Here, we
introduce a novel computational paradigm, Self-Adaptable Graph Attention
Networks integrated with Symbolic Regression (SA-GAT-SR), that synergistically
combines the predictive capability of GNNs with the interpretative power of
symbolic regression. Our framework employs a self-adaptable encoding algorithm
that automatically identifies and adjust attention weights so as to screen
critical features from an expansive 180-dimensional feature space while
maintaining O(n) computational scaling. The integrated SR module subsequently
distills these features into compact analytical expressions that explicitly
reveal quantum-mechanically meaningful relationships, achieving 23 times
acceleration compared to conventional SR implementations that heavily rely on
first principle calculations-derived features as input. This work suggests a
new framework in computational materials science, bridging the gap between
predictive accuracy and physical interpretability, offering valuable physical
insights into material behavior.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for heterogeneous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
swarms to perform complex tasks in urban environments, system design now faces
major challenges, including efficient semantic understanding, flexible task
planning, and the ability to dynamically adjust coordination strategies in
response to evolving environmental conditions and continuously changing task
requirements. To address the limitations of existing approaches, this paper
proposes coordination field agentic system for coordinating heterogeneous UAV
swarms in complex urban scenarios. In this system, large language models (LLMs)
is responsible for interpreting high-level human instructions and converting
them into executable commands for the UAV swarms, such as patrol and target
tracking. Subsequently, a Coordination field mechanism is proposed to guide UAV
motion and task selection, enabling decentralized and adaptive allocation of
emergent tasks. A total of 50 rounds of comparative testing were conducted
across different models in a 2D simulation space to evaluate their performance.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves superior
performance in terms of task coverage, response time, and adaptability to

Abstract: The development of novel autonomous underwater gliders has been hindered by
limited shape diversity, primarily due to the reliance on traditional design
tools that depend heavily on manual trial and error. Building an automated
design framework is challenging due to the complexities of representing glider
shapes and the high computational costs associated with modeling complex
solid-fluid interactions. In this work, we introduce an AI-enhanced automated
computational framework designed to overcome these limitations by enabling the
creation of underwater robots with non-trivial hull shapes. Our approach
involves an algorithm that co-optimizes both shape and control signals,
utilizing a reduced-order geometry representation and a differentiable
neural-network-based fluid surrogate model. This end-to-end design workflow
facilitates rapid iteration and evaluation of hydrodynamic performance, leading
to the discovery of optimal and complex hull shapes across various control
settings. We validate our method through wind tunnel experiments and swimming
pool gliding tests, demonstrating that our computationally designed gliders
surpass manually designed counterparts in terms of energy efficiency. By
addressing challenges in efficient shape representation and neural fluid
surrogate models, our work paves the way for the development of highly
efficient underwater gliders, with implications for long-range ocean
exploration and environmental monitoring.

Abstract: Recently, natural language has been the primary medium for human-robot
interaction. However, its inherent lack of spatial precision for robotic
control introduces challenges such as ambiguity and verbosity. To address these
limitations, we introduce the Robotic Visual Instruction (RoVI), a novel
paradigm to guide robotic tasks through an object-centric, hand-drawn symbolic
representation. RoVI effectively encodes spatial-temporal information into
human-interpretable visual instructions through 2D sketches, utilizing arrows,
circles, colors, and numbers to direct 3D robotic manipulation. To enable
robots to understand RoVI better and generate precise actions based on RoVI, we
present Visual Instruction Embodied Workflow (VIEW), a pipeline formulated for
RoVI-conditioned policies. This approach leverages Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to interpret RoVI inputs, decode spatial and temporal constraints from
2D pixel space via keypoint extraction, and then transform them into executable
3D action sequences. We additionally curate a specialized dataset of 15K
instances to fine-tune small VLMs for edge deployment, enabling them to
effectively learn RoVI capabilities. Our approach is rigorously validated
across 11 novel tasks in both real and simulated environments, demonstrating
significant generalization capability. Notably, VIEW achieves an 87.5% success
rate in real-world scenarios involving unseen tasks that feature multi-step
actions, with disturbances, and trajectory-following requirements. Code and

### [210] [AI2-Active Safety: AI-enabled Interaction-aware Active Safety Analysis with Vehicle Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00322)
*Keshu Wu,Zihao Li,Sixu Li,Xinyue Ye,Dominique Lord,Yang Zhou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于AI的交互感知主动安全分析框架，通过车辆群体交互建模和高精度轨迹预测，结合3D道路梯度，生成高保真安全指标（如TTC）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全分析方法未充分考虑车辆群体交互和道路梯度，导致预测精度不足。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用自行车模型（考虑道路梯度）捕捉车辆动力学，结合超图AI模型预测交通轨迹，通过随机微分方程计算车辆间距。

Result: 与传统方法相比，该框架生成的HF-TTC分布更准确，能反映复杂多车行为和不确定性。

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂交通环境下的主动安全分析提供了系统性方法，提升了安全感知能力。

Abstract: This paper introduces an AI-enabled, interaction-aware active safety analysis
framework that accounts for groupwise vehicle interactions. Specifically, the
framework employs a bicycle model-augmented with road gradient
considerations-to accurately capture vehicle dynamics. In parallel, a
hypergraph-based AI model is developed to predict probabilistic trajectories of
ambient traffic. By integrating these two components, the framework derives
vehicle intra-spacing over a 3D road surface as the solution of a stochastic
ordinary differential equation, yielding high-fidelity surrogate safety
measures such as time-to-collision (TTC). To demonstrate its effectiveness, the
framework is analyzed using stochastic numerical methods comprising 4th-order
Runge-Kutta integration and AI inference, generating probability-weighted
high-fidelity TTC (HF-TTC) distributions that reflect complex multi-agent
maneuvers and behavioral uncertainties. Evaluated with HF-TTC against
traditional constant-velocity TTC and non-interaction-aware approaches on
highway datasets, the proposed framework offers a systematic methodology for
active safety analysis with enhanced potential for improving safety perception
in complex traffic environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种集成方法，用于动态和不确定环境中移动机器人的安全高效控制，结合多模态运动预测和模型预测控制，显著提升动态避障性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态和不确定环境中的移动机器人控制面临挑战，需要高效预测和避障方法。

Method: 采用一次性多模态运动预测和模型预测控制，通过能量神经网络生成预测，并分组处理动态障碍物。

Result: 在典型仓库场景中，该方法优于现有动态避障方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了移动机器人在动态环境中的导航能力。

Abstract: This paper proposes an integrated approach for the safe and efficient control
of mobile robots in dynamic and uncertain environments. The approach consists
of two key steps: one-shot multimodal motion prediction to anticipate motions
of dynamic obstacles and model predictive control to incorporate these
predictions into the motion planning process. Motion prediction is driven by an
energy-based neural network that generates high-resolution, multi-step
predictions in a single operation. The prediction outcomes are further utilized
to create geometric shapes formulated as mathematical constraints. Instead of
treating each dynamic obstacle individually, predicted obstacles are grouped by
proximity in an unsupervised way to improve performance and efficiency. The
overall collision-free navigation is handled by model predictive control with a
specific design for proactive dynamic obstacle avoidance. The proposed approach
allows mobile robots to navigate effectively in dynamic environments. Its
performance is accessed across various scenarios that represent typical
warehouse settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms other existing dynamic obstacle avoidance methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应强化学习框架，使四足机器人能够动态适应变化的负载和地形，无需预定义步态或手动调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MPC方法依赖预定义步态或轨迹生成器，限制了在非结构化环境中的适应性。

Method: 结合名义策略（基线运动）和自适应策略（学习纠正动作），以增强稳定性和命令跟踪能力。

Result: 在仿真和硬件实验中，自适应控制器在多种地形和负载变化下均表现优于基准控制器。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了四足机器人的鲁棒性和适应性，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: Quadrupedal robots are increasingly deployed for load-carrying tasks across
diverse terrains. While Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based methods can
account for payload variations, they often depend on predefined gait schedules
or trajectory generators, limiting their adaptability in unstructured
environments. To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive
Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that enables quadrupedal robots to
dynamically adapt to both varying payloads and diverse terrains. The framework
consists of a nominal policy responsible for baseline locomotion and an
adaptive policy that learns corrective actions to preserve stability and
improve command tracking under payload variations. We validate the proposed
approach through large-scale simulation experiments in Isaac Gym and real-world
hardware deployment on a Unitree Go1 quadruped. The controller was tested on
flat ground, slopes, and stairs under both static and dynamic payload changes.
Across all settings, our adaptive controller consistently outperformed the
controller in tracking body height and velocity commands, demonstrating
enhanced robustness and adaptability without requiring explicit gait design or
manual tuning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: COIL（成本最优交互学习）是一种多任务交互规划器，通过策略性地选择三种查询类型（技能、偏好和帮助）来最小化人类在任务序列中的努力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协作机器人需要持续适应新任务和用户偏好，同时不增加用户负担。现有方法通常局限于单任务场景，不适合持续的多任务协作。

Method: COIL将问题建模为无容量限制设施选址（UFL）问题，以多项式时间实现次优规划。对于用户偏好不确定性，采用一步信念空间规划。

Result: 模拟和物理实验表明，COIL显著减少了人类的工作量，同时保持任务成功完成。

Conclusion: COIL为多任务协作机器人提供了一种高效且适应性强的交互学习框架。

Abstract: Collaborative robots must continually adapt to novel tasks and user
preferences without overburdening the user. While prior interactive robot
learning methods aim to reduce human effort, they are typically limited to
single-task scenarios and are not well-suited for sustained, multi-task
collaboration. We propose COIL (Cost-Optimal Interactive Learning) -- a
multi-task interaction planner that minimizes human effort across a sequence of
tasks by strategically selecting among three query types (skill, preference,
and help). When user preferences are known, we formulate COIL as an
uncapacitated facility location (UFL) problem, which enables bounded-suboptimal
planning in polynomial time using off-the-shelf approximation algorithms. We
extend our formulation to handle uncertainty in user preferences by
incorporating one-step belief space planning, which uses these approximation
algorithms as subroutines to maintain polynomial-time performance. Simulated
and physical experiments on manipulation tasks show that our framework
significantly reduces the amount of work allocated to the human while
maintaining successful task completion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶中的街景语义理解（S3U）面临领域偏移导致的泛化能力差问题，联邦学习（FL）虽有助于隐私保护分布式学习，但动态环境中的时间灾难性遗忘问题严重。

Method: 提出FedEMA框架，包含服务器端历史模型融合（EMA模型）和车辆端负熵正则化，平衡泛化与适应性。

Result: 在Cityscapes和Camvid数据集上，FedEMA的mIoU比现有方法高7.12%。

Conclusion: FedEMA通过双目标优化有效解决了时间灾难性遗忘问题，提升了自动驾驶模型的性能。

Abstract: Street Scene Semantic Understanding (denoted as S3U) is a crucial but complex
task for autonomous driving (AD) vehicles. Their inference models typically
face poor generalization due to domain-shift. Federated Learning (FL) has
emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing the generalization of AD models
through privacy-preserving distributed learning. However, these FL AD models
face significant temporal catastrophic forgetting when deployed in dynamically
evolving environments, where continuous adaptation causes abrupt erosion of
historical knowledge. This paper proposes Federated Exponential Moving Average
(FedEMA), a novel framework that addresses this challenge through two integral
innovations: (I) Server-side model's historical fitting capability preservation
via fusing current FL round's aggregation model and a proposed previous FL
round's exponential moving average (EMA) model; (II) Vehicle-side negative
entropy regularization to prevent FL models' possible overfitting to
EMA-introduced temporal patterns. Above two strategies empower FedEMA a
dual-objective optimization that balances model generalization and
adaptability. In addition, we conduct theoretical convergence analysis for the
proposed FedEMA. Extensive experiments both on Cityscapes dataset and Camvid
dataset demonstrate FedEMA's superiority over existing approaches, showing
7.12% higher mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU).

Motivation: 现有方法在生成安全关键交通场景时存在物理不真实和效率低的问题，影响了自动驾驶系统的评估效果。

Method: 使用基于图的变分自编码器（VAE）学习紧凑的潜在空间，结合扩散模型进行去噪生成真实轨迹，并通过新颖的引导目标和物理可行性检查模块提升对抗性和真实性。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，该方法在对抗性效果和生成效率上优于现有基线，同时保持了高真实性。

Conclusion: 该方法为安全关键场景仿真提供了有效工具，有助于更稳健地评估自动驾驶系统。

Abstract: Safety-critical traffic simulation plays a crucial role in evaluating
autonomous driving systems under rare and challenging scenarios. However,
existing approaches often generate unrealistic scenarios due to insufficient
consideration of physical plausibility and suffer from low generation
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a guided latent diffusion
model (LDM) capable of generating physically realistic and adversarial
safety-critical traffic scenarios. Specifically, our model employs a
graph-based variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn a compact latent space that
captures complex multi-agent interactions while improving computational
efficiency. Within this latent space, the diffusion model performs the
denoising process to produce realistic trajectories. To enable controllable and
adversarial scenario generation, we introduce novel guidance objectives that
drive the diffusion process toward producing adversarial and behaviorally
realistic driving behaviors. Furthermore, we develop a sample selection module
based on physical feasibility checks to further enhance the physical
plausibility of the generated scenarios. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes
dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior adversarial effectiveness
and generation efficiency compared to existing baselines while maintaining a
high level of realism. Our work provides an effective tool for realistic
safety-critical scenario simulation, paving the way for more robust evaluation
of autonomous driving systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 变形物体操纵（DOM）因物体自由度无限且观测部分密集，导致状态空间大、采样复杂性和策略学习不确定性高。

Method: 采用隐式神经表示学习（INR）重建完整表面（符号距离函数），并通过强化学习（RL）进行表示微调，优化策略学习。

Result: 在仿真环境和真实机械臂（Franka Emika Panda）实验中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: INR-DOM通过学习一致的状态表示和强化学习微调，有效解决了弹性变形物体的操纵问题。

Abstract: We aim to solve the problem of manipulating deformable objects, particularly
elastic bands, in real-world scenarios. However, deformable object manipulation
(DOM) requires a policy that works on a large state space due to the unlimited
degree of freedom (DoF) of deformable objects. Further, their dense but partial
observations (e.g., images or point clouds) may increase the sampling
complexity and uncertainty in policy learning. To figure it out, we propose a
novel implicit neural-representation (INR) learning for elastic DOMs, called
INR-DOM. Our method learns consistent state representations associated with
partially observable elastic objects reconstructing a complete and implicit
surface represented as a signed distance function. Furthermore, we perform
exploratory representation fine-tuning through reinforcement learning (RL) that
enables RL algorithms to effectively learn exploitable representations while
efficiently obtaining a DOM policy. We perform quantitative and qualitative
analyses building three simulated environments and real-world manipulation
studies with a Franka Emika Panda arm. Videos are available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂任务时，现有方法仅能处理固定或参数化的STL规范，缺乏多样化的STL数据集和有效编码器。

Method: 提出TeLoGraF，结合图神经网络编码器和流匹配技术，学习通用STL规范的解决方案。

Result: 在五个仿真环境中测试，STL满足率优于基线方法，推理速度快10-100倍，且适用于任意系统动力学。

Conclusion: TeLoGraF能高效解决复杂STL问题，对分布外STL规范具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Learning to solve complex tasks with signal temporal logic (STL)
specifications is crucial to many real-world applications. However, most
previous works only consider fixed or parametrized STL specifications due to
the lack of a diverse STL dataset and encoders to effectively extract temporal
logic information for downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose TeLoGraF,
Temporal Logic Graph-encoded Flow, which utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNN)
encoder and flow-matching to learn solutions for general STL specifications. We
identify four commonly used STL templates and collect a total of 200K
specifications with paired demonstrations. We conduct extensive experiments in
five simulation environments ranging from simple dynamical models in the 2D
space to high-dimensional 7DoF Franka Panda robot arm and Ant quadruped
navigation. Results show that our method outperforms other baselines in the STL
satisfaction rate. Compared to classical STL planning algorithms, our approach
is 10-100X faster in inference and can work on any system dynamics. Besides, we
show our graph-encoding method's capability to solve complex STLs and
robustness to out-distribution STL specifications. Code is available at

we propose DetMCVI, an adaptation of the Monte Carlo Value Iteration (MCVI)
algorithm for DetPOMDPs, which builds policies in the form of finite-state

outperforming existing baselines for DetPOMDPs. We also verify the performance
of the algorithm in a real-world mobile robot forest mapping scenario.

Abstract: As machine learning is increasingly deployed in autonomous systems,
verification of neural network controllers is becoming an active research
domain. Existing tools and annual verification competitions suggest that soon
this technology will become effective for real-world applications. Our
application comes from the emerging field of microflyers that are passively
transported by the wind, which may have various uses in weather or pollution
monitoring. Specifically, we investigate centimetre-scale bio-inspired gliding
drones that resemble Alsomitra macrocarpa diaspores. In this paper, we propose
a new case study on verifying Alsomitra-inspired drones with neural network
controllers, with the aim of adhering closely to a target trajectory. We show
that our system differs substantially from existing VNN and ARCH competition
benchmarks, and show that a combination of tools holds promise for verifying
such systems in the future, if certain shortcomings can be overcome. We propose
a novel method for robust training of regression networks, and investigate
formalisations of this case study in Vehicle and CORA. Our verification results
suggest that the investigated training methods do improve performance and
robustness of neural network controllers in this application, but are limited
in scope and usefulness. This is due to systematic limitations of both Vehicle
and CORA, and the complexity of our system reducing the scale of reachability,
which we investigate in detail. If these limitations can be overcome, it will
enable engineers to develop safe and robust technologies that improve people's
lives and reduce our impact on the environment.

Motivation: 自动停车是高级驾驶辅助系统（ADAS）的关键功能，但现有研究多集中于单模态车辆轨迹预测，缺乏对多模态和不确定性的处理。

Method: ParkDiffusion采用扩散模型捕捉轨迹的多模态和不确定性，包括双地图编码器、自适应代理类型嵌入模块和运动学框架。

Result: 在DLP和inD数据集上，ParkDiffusion显著优于现有方法，为异构轨迹预测设定了新基准。

Conclusion: ParkDiffusion通过创新设计解决了自动停车场景中的多模态轨迹预测问题，为ADAS提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated parking is a critical feature of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems
(ADAS), where accurate trajectory prediction is essential to bridge perception
and planning modules. Despite its significance, research in this domain remains
relatively limited, with most existing studies concentrating on single-modal
trajectory prediction of vehicles. In this work, we propose ParkDiffusion, a
novel approach that predicts the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians
in automated parking scenarios. ParkDiffusion employs diffusion models to
capture the inherent uncertainty and multi-modality of future trajectories,
incorporating several key innovations. First, we propose a dual map encoder
that processes soft semantic cues and hard geometric constraints using a
two-step cross-attention mechanism. Second, we introduce an adaptive agent type
embedding module, which dynamically conditions the prediction process on the
distinct characteristics of vehicles and pedestrians. Third, to ensure
kinematic feasibility, our model outputs control signals that are subsequently
used within a kinematic framework to generate physically feasible trajectories.
We evaluate ParkDiffusion on the Dragon Lake Parking (DLP) dataset and the
Intersections Drone (inD) dataset. Our work establishes a new baseline for
heterogeneous trajectory prediction in parking scenarios, outperforming
existing methods by a considerable margin.

also present an efficient and differentiable $O(d^3)$ algorithm to compute the
parameters of the inverse BLT matrix, where $d$ is the degree of the original

Abstract: This article describes the process of creating a script and conducting an

comparison is made of the effectiveness of binary classifiers in the task of
detecting distorted data. The dynamics of changes in the quality indicators of
the regression model were analyzed in conditions without adversarial attacks,
during an adversarial attack and when the distorted data was isolated. It is
shown that an adversarial FGSM attack with gradient maximization leads to an
increase in the value of the MSE metric by 33% and a decrease in the R2
indicator by 10% on average. The LightGBM binary classifier effectively
identifies data with adversarial anomalies with 98% accuracy. Regression
machine learning models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, but rapid
analysis of network traffic and data transmitted over the network makes it

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过结构化干预（如AI-Lab），学生能更有效地使用生成式AI（GenAI），提升学习效果和技能发展，同时避免过度依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生成式AI在计算机科学教育中的影响，尤其是学生如何通过结构化指导更有效地使用这些工具。

Method: 在普渡大学的四门课程中引入AI-Lab模块，收集831份前后调查问卷和焦点小组讨论数据，采用混合方法分析。

Result: 学生使用GenAI的频率稳定，但在调试和作业问题上的舒适度和开放性显著提高，使用方式更谨慎和反思。

Conclusion: 结构化干预能帮助学生更负责任地使用GenAI，建议教育者在课程中推广此类方法，并进一步研究GenAI支持的教学模式。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly entering computer science education, yet its
effects on student learning, skill development, and perceptions remain
underexplored. Concerns about overreliance coexist with a gap in research on
structured scaffolding to guide tool use in formal courses. This study examines
the impact of a dedicated "AI-Lab" intervention -- emphasizing guided
scaffolding and mindful engagement -- on undergraduate students in Data
Structures and Algorithms, Competitive Programming, and first-year engineering
courses at Purdue University.
  Over three semesters, we integrated AI-Lab modules into four mandatory and
elective courses, yielding 831 matched pre- and post-intervention survey
responses, alongside focus group discussions. Employing a mixed-methods
approach, we analyzed quantitative shifts in usage patterns and attitudes as
well as qualitative narratives of student experiences.
  While the overall frequency of GenAI usage for homework or programming
projects remained largely stable, we observed large effect sizes in comfort and
openness across conceptual, debugging, and homework problems. Notably, usage
patterns for debugging also shifted statistically significantly, reflecting
students' more mindful and deliberate approach. Focus group discussions
corroborated these results, suggesting that the intervention "bridged the gap"
between naive GenAI usage and more nuanced, reflective integration of AI tools
into coursework, ultimately heightening students' awareness of their own skill
development.
  These findings suggest that structured, scaffolded interventions can enable
students to harness GenAI's benefits without undermining essential
competencies. We offer evidence-based recommendations for educators seeking to
integrate GenAI responsibly into computing curricula and identify avenues for
future research on GenAI-supported pedagogy.

Motivation: 随着LLMs在人类中心任务中的广泛应用，评估其心理特质对于理解其社会影响和确保可信AI对齐至关重要。现有研究未系统讨论某些重要领域，如多样化的心理测试、LLM专用心理数据集及其应用。

Method: 系统回顾了六个维度：评估工具、LLM专用数据集、评估指标（一致性和稳定性）、实证发现、人格模拟方法和行为模拟。

Result: 部分LLMs在特定提示方案下表现出可复现的人格模式，但在任务和设置中存在显著变异性。方法学挑战包括心理工具与LLM能力的不匹配及评估实践的不一致性。

Conclusion: 研究旨在为开发更可解释、稳健和通用的LLM心理评估框架提出未来方向。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in human-centered
tasks, assessing their psychological traits is crucial for understanding their
social impact and ensuring trustworthy AI alignment. While existing reviews
have covered some aspects of related research, several important areas have not
been systematically discussed, including detailed discussions of diverse
psychological tests, LLM-specific psychological datasets, and the applications
of LLMs with psychological traits. To address this gap, we systematically
review six key dimensions of applying psychological theories to LLMs: (1)
assessment tools; (2) LLM-specific datasets; (3) evaluation metrics
(consistency and stability); (4) empirical findings; (5) personality simulation
methods; and (6) LLM-based behavior simulation. Our analysis highlights both
the strengths and limitations of current methods. While some LLMs exhibit
reproducible personality patterns under specific prompting schemes, significant
variability remains across tasks and settings. Recognizing methodological
challenges such as mismatches between psychological tools and LLMs'
capabilities, as well as inconsistencies in evaluation practices, this study
aims to propose future directions for developing more interpretable, robust,
and generalizable psychological assessment frameworks for LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出首个研究多集体策略性操纵数据驱动系统的框架，发现集体间的意外互动会显著降低单个集体的效能，强调算法透明性和集体行动的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据依赖算法系统影响日益广泛，个人需通过集体行动维护利益并问责算法。研究多集体互动对系统的影响。

Method: 引入框架研究多集体策略行为，通过语言模型分类器和推荐系统实验，分析目标、策略、规模和同质性对效能的影响。

Result: 集体间互动显著降低效能（高达75%），推荐系统中同质性与异质性集体效能差异不大，规模影响更大。

Conclusion: 需提高算法透明性，框架为集体问责开发者并利用数据维护利益提供工具。

Abstract: Given that data-dependent algorithmic systems have become impactful in more
domains of life, the need for individuals to promote their own interests and
hold algorithms accountable has grown. To have meaningful influence,
individuals must band together to engage in collective action. Groups that
engage in such algorithmic collective action are likely to vary in size,
membership characteristics, and crucially, objectives. In this work, we
introduce a first of a kind framework for studying collective action with two
or more collectives that strategically behave to manipulate data-driven
systems. With more than one collective acting on a system, unexpected
interactions may occur. We use this framework to conduct experiments with
language model-based classifiers and recommender systems where two collectives
each attempt to achieve their own individual objectives. We examine how
differing objectives, strategies, sizes, and homogeneity can impact a
collective's efficacy. We find that the unintentional interactions between
collectives can be quite significant; a collective acting in isolation may be
able to achieve their objective (e.g., improve classification outcomes for
themselves or promote a particular item), but when a second collective acts
simultaneously, the efficacy of the first group drops by as much as $75\%$. We
find that, in the recommender system context, neither fully heterogeneous nor
fully homogeneous collectives stand out as most efficacious and that
heterogeneity's impact is secondary compared to collective size. Our results
signal the need for more transparency in both the underlying algorithmic models
and the different behaviors individuals or collectives may take on these
systems. This approach also allows collectives to hold algorithmic system
developers accountable and provides a framework for people to actively use
their own data to promote their own interests.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前NQS在复杂量子多体系统中的计算成本过高，且难以泛化到大规模系统和多样参数范围。

Method: 结合迁移学习和课程学习，提出Pairing-Net架构，并通过扰动理论解释如何融入先验物理知识。

Result: 实现了约200倍的计算加速，并显著提高了优化稳定性。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效探索量子多体系统的广阔参数空间提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in neural network quantum states (NQS) have enabled
high-accuracy predictions for complex quantum many-body systems such as
strongly correlated electron systems. However, the computational cost remains
prohibitive, making exploration of the diverse parameters of interaction
strengths and other physical parameters inefficient. While transfer learning
has been proposed to mitigate this challenge, achieving generalization to
large-scale systems and diverse parameter regimes remains difficult. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel curriculum learning framework based on
transfer learning for NQS. This facilitates efficient and stable exploration
across a vast parameter space of quantum many-body systems. In addition, by
interpreting NQS transfer learning through a perturbative lens, we demonstrate
how prior physical knowledge can be flexibly incorporated into the curriculum
learning process. We also propose Pairing-Net, an architecture to practically
implement this strategy for strongly correlated electron systems, and
empirically verify its effectiveness. Our results show an approximately
200-fold speedup in computation and a marked improvement in optimization
stability compared to conventional methods.

TL;DR: WeatherWeaver是一种视频扩散模型，可直接在输入视频中合成多样化的天气效果，无需3D建模，提供精确控制和高质量结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物理模拟方法难以扩展到真实视频，而视频编辑缺乏真实感和控制性。

Method: 结合合成视频、生成图像编辑和自动标记的真实视频数据，训练视频扩散模型。

Result: 在天气模拟和去除任务中优于现有方法，提供高质量、物理合理且保留场景身份的结果。

Conclusion: WeatherWeaver在真实感和可控性方面表现出色，适用于多种天气效果的视频编辑。

Abstract: Generating realistic and controllable weather effects in videos is valuable
for many applications. Physics-based weather simulation requires precise
reconstructions that are hard to scale to in-the-wild videos, while current
video editing often lacks realism and control. In this work, we introduce
WeatherWeaver, a video diffusion model that synthesizes diverse weather effects
-- including rain, snow, fog, and clouds -- directly into any input video
without the need for 3D modeling. Our model provides precise control over
weather effect intensity and supports blending various weather types, ensuring
both realism and adaptability. To overcome the scarcity of paired training
data, we propose a novel data strategy combining synthetic videos, generative
image editing, and auto-labeled real-world videos. Extensive evaluations show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in weather simulation and
removal, providing high-quality, physically plausible, and
scene-identity-preserving results over various real-world videos.

Result: 该方法在小卫星应用中展示了高效的数据处理和异常检测能力。

Conclusion: 研究为小卫星任务提供了新的机器学习方法，同时推动了非洲空间技术与人工智能的发展。

Abstract: Small satellite technologies have enhanced the potential and feasibility of
geodesic missions, through simplification of design and decreased costs
allowing for more frequent launches. On-satellite data acquisition systems can
benefit from the implementation of machine learning (ML), for better
performance and greater efficiency on tasks such as image processing or feature
extraction. This work presents convolutional autoencoders for implementation on
the payload of small satellites, designed to achieve dual functionality of data
compression for more efficient off-satellite transmission, and at-source
anomaly detection to inform satellite data-taking. This capability is
demonstrated for a use case of disaster monitoring using aerial image datasets
of the African continent, offering avenues for both novel ML-based approaches
in small satellite applications along with the expansion of space technology
and artificial intelligence in Africa.

TL;DR: D-Tracker是一种用于从社交活动张量数据流中捕捉时变模式并预测未来活动的方法，具有可解释性、自动化和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交活动数据（如搜索量和感染病例数）反映了人们的兴趣和行为，但因其高维性和时变动态（如趋势、季节性和兴趣扩散）而难以建模和预测。

Method: D-Tracker将偏微分方程融入张量分解框架，以可解释的方式捕捉时变模式（如趋势、季节性和兴趣扩散），无需超参数且计算时间与时间序列长度无关。

Result: 在GoogleTrends搜索量和COVID-19感染数据上的实验表明，D-Tracker在预测准确性和计算时间上优于现有方法，并能提取位置间的兴趣扩散。

Conclusion: D-Tracker是一种高效且可解释的方法，适用于社交活动数据流的建模和预测。

Abstract: Large quantities of social activity data, such as weekly web search volumes
and the number of new infections with infectious diseases, reflect peoples'
interests and activities. It is important to discover temporal patterns from
such data and to forecast future activities accurately. However, modeling and
forecasting social activity data streams is difficult because they are
high-dimensional and composed of multiple time-varying dynamics such as trends,
seasonality, and interest diffusion. In this paper, we propose D-Tracker, a
method for continuously capturing time-varying temporal patterns within social
activity tensor data streams and forecasting future activities. Our proposed
method has the following properties: (a) Interpretable: it incorporates the
partial differential equation into a tensor decomposition framework and
captures time-varying temporal patterns such as trends, seasonality, and
interest diffusion between locations in an interpretable manner; (b) Automatic:
it has no hyperparameters and continuously models tensor data streams fully
automatically; (c) Scalable: the computation time of D-Tracker is independent
of the time series length. Experiments using web search volume data obtained
from GoogleTrends, and COVID-19 infection data obtained from COVID-19 Open Data
Repository show that our method can achieve higher forecasting accuracy in less
computation time than existing methods while extracting the interest diffusion
between locations. Our source code and datasets are available at

Abstract: Effective data visualization requires not only technical proficiency but also
a deep understanding of the domain-specific context in which data exists. This
context often includes tacit knowledge about data provenance, quality, and
intended use, which is rarely explicit in the dataset itself. We present the
Data Therapist, a web-based tool that helps domain experts externalize this

with interactive annotation. Powered by a large language model, the system
analyzes user-supplied datasets, prompts users with targeted questions, and
allows annotation at varying levels of granularity. The resulting structured
knowledge base can inform both human and automated visualization design. We
evaluated the tool in a qualitative study involving expert pairs from Molecular
Biology, Accounting, Political Science, and Usable Security. The study revealed
recurring patterns in how experts reason about their data and highlights areas

Motivation: LLM多智能体系统中的故障归因对系统调试至关重要，但目前研究不足且耗时。

Method: 提出自动化故障归因任务，引入Who&When数据集，并开发三种方法进行评估。

Result: 最佳方法在识别故障责任代理上达到53.5%准确率，但在定位故障步骤上仅14.2%，部分方法表现低于随机。

Conclusion: 任务复杂，现有方法效果有限，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Failure attribution in LLM multi-agent systems-identifying the agent and step
responsible for task failures-provides crucial clues for systems debugging but
remains underexplored and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose and
formulate a new research area: automated failure attribution for LLM
multi-agent systems. To support this initiative, we introduce the Who&When
dataset, comprising extensive failure logs from 127 LLM multi-agent systems
with fine-grained annotations linking failures to specific agents and decisive
error steps. Using the Who&When, we develop and evaluate three automated
failure attribution methods, summarizing their corresponding pros and cons. The
best method achieves 53.5% accuracy in identifying failure-responsible agents
but only 14.2% in pinpointing failure steps, with some methods performing below
random. Even SOTA reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1, fail to
achieve practical usability. These results highlight the task's complexity and
the need for further research in this area. Code and dataset are available at

Method: 集中式学习，单智能体学习后模型传播至非学习智能体，奖励函数促进角色分化。

Result: 智能体行为分化，动态调整角色，无需显式通信。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且适用于动态环境，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning strategy for use in multi-agent foraging
systems in which the learning is centralised to a single agent and its model is
periodically disseminated among the population of non-learning agents. In a
domain where multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is the common approach,
this approach aims to significantly reduce the computational and energy demands
compared to approaches such as MARL and centralised learning models. By
developing high performing foraging agents, these approaches can be translated
into real-world applications such as logistics, environmental monitoring, and
autonomous exploration. A reward function was incorporated into this approach
that promotes role development among agents, without explicit directives. This
led to the differentiation of behaviours among the agents. The implicit
encouragement of role differentiation allows for dynamic actions in which
agents can alter roles dependent on their interactions with the environment
without the need for explicit communication between agents.

Motivation: 传统基于矩形图像块的注意力机制在视觉强化学习任务中表现优异，但存在表示复杂和计算成本高的问题。

Method: 利用图像分割技术提取原型对象，将其编码为紧凑特征向量，构建更小的自注意力模块。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在性能上匹配或超越现有最佳方法，同时参数减少62%，训练时间缩短2.6倍。

Conclusion: 基于原型对象的注意力机制在效率和性能上均优于传统方法，为视觉任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Proto-objects - image regions that share common visual properties - offer a
promising alternative to traditional attention mechanisms based on
rectangular-shaped image patches in neural networks. Although previous work
demonstrated that evolving a patch-based hard-attention module alongside a
controller network could achieve state-of-the-art performance in visual
reinforcement learning tasks, our approach leverages image segmentation to work
with higher-level features. By operating on proto-objects rather than fixed
patches, we significantly reduce the representational complexity: each image
decomposes into fewer proto-objects than regular patches, and each proto-object
can be efficiently encoded as a compact feature vector. This enables a
substantially smaller self-attention module that processes richer semantic
information. Our experiments demonstrate that this proto-object-based approach
matches or exceeds the state-of-the-art performance of patch-based
implementations with 62% less parameters and 2.6 times less training time.

Result: 在功率约束下实现满意的分类精度，且多跳数和高信噪比可提升性能。

Conclusion: 该框架在多跳MIMO网络中有效，为空中机器学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: A novel over-the-air machine learning framework over multi-hop multiple-input
and multiple-output (MIMO) networks is proposed. The core idea is to imitate
fully connected (FC) neural network layers using multiple MIMO channels by
carefully designing the precoding matrices at the transmitting nodes. A neural
network dubbed PrototypeNet is employed consisting of multiple FC layers, with
the number of neurons of each layer equal to the number of antennas of the
corresponding terminal. To achieve satisfactory performance, we train
PrototypeNet based on a customized loss function consisting of classification
error and the power of latent vectors to satisfy transmit power constraints,
with noise injection during training. Precoding matrices for each hop are then
obtained by solving an optimization problem. We also propose a multiple-block
extension when the number of antennas is limited. Numerical results verify that
the proposed over-the-air transmission scheme can achieve satisfactory
classification accuracy under a power constraint. The results also show that
higher classification accuracy can be achieved with an increasing number of
hops at a modest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Abstract: Interpretable insights from predictive models remain critical in
bio-statistics, particularly when assessing causality, where classical
statistical and machine learning methods often provide inherent clarity. While
Neural Networks (NNs) offer powerful capabilities for modeling complex
biological data, their traditional "black-box" nature presents challenges for
validation and trust in high-stakes health applications. Recent advances in
Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aim to decipher the internal computations
learned by these networks. This work investigates the application of MI
techniques to NNs within the context of causal inference for bio-statistics.
  We demonstrate that MI tools can be leveraged to: (1) probe and validate the
internal representations learned by NNs, such as those estimating nuisance
functions in frameworks like Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimation (TMLE); (2)
discover and visualize the distinct computational pathways employed by the
network to process different types of inputs, potentially revealing how
confounders and treatments are handled; and (3) provide methodologies for
comparing the learned mechanisms and extracted insights across statistical,
machine learning, and NN models, fostering a deeper understanding of their
respective strengths and weaknesses for causal bio-statistical analysis.

Conclusion: 边缘LAM在6G中具有广阔的应用前景，但仍需解决资源限制问题。

Abstract: Large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) possess human-like abilities to
solve a wide range of real-world problems, exemplifying the potential of
experts in various domains and modalities. By leveraging the communication and
computation capabilities of geographically dispersed edge devices, edge LAM
emerges as an enabling technology to empower the delivery of various real-time
intelligent services in 6G. Unlike traditional edge artificial intelligence
(AI) that primarily supports a single task using small models, edge LAM is
featured by the need of the decomposition and distributed deployment of large
models, and the ability to support highly generalized and diverse tasks.
However, due to limited communication, computation, and storage resources over
wireless networks, the vast number of trainable neurons and the substantial
communication overhead pose a formidable hurdle to the practical deployment of
edge LAMs. In this paper, we investigate the opportunities and challenges of
edge LAMs from the perspectives of model decomposition and resource management.
Specifically, we propose collaborative fine-tuning and full-parameter training
frameworks, alongside a microservice-assisted inference architecture, to
enhance the deployment of edge LAM over wireless networks. Additionally, we
investigate the application of edge LAM in air-interface designs, focusing on
channel prediction and beamforming. These innovative frameworks and
applications offer valuable insights and solutions for advancing 6G technology.

Abstract: Identifying key biomarkers for COVID-19 from high-dimensional multi-omics

this study, we evaluated the applicability of the Quantum Support Vector

Proteomic and metabolomic biomarkers from two independent datasets were ranked
by importance using ridge regression and grouped accordingly. The top- and
bottom-ranked biomarker sets were then used to train and evaluate both
classical SVM (CSVM) and QSVM models, serving as predictive and negative
control inputs, respectively. The QSVM was implemented with multiple quantum
kernels, including amplitude encoding, angle encoding, the ZZ feature map, and
the projected quantum kernel. Across various experimental settings, QSVM
consistently achieved classification performance that was comparable to or
exceeded that of CSVM, while reflecting the importance rankings by ridge
regression. Although the experiments were conducted in numerical simulation,
our findings highlight the potential of QSVM as a promising approach for
multi-omics data analysis in biomedical research.

Abstract: We present a novel hybrid quantum-classical neural network architecture for
fraud detection that integrates a classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
network with a variational quantum circuit. By leveraging quantum phenomena
such as superposition and entanglement, our model enhances the feature
representation of sequential transaction data, capturing complex non-linear

preprocessing pipeline is employed to clean, encode, balance, and normalize a

Notably, our hybrid approach achieves per-epoch training times in the range of
45-65 seconds, which is significantly faster than similar architectures
reported in the literature, where training typically requires several minutes
per epoch. Both classical and quantum gradients are jointly optimized via a
unified backpropagation procedure employing the parameter-shift rule for the
quantum parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrate competitive
improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score relative to a
conventional LSTM baseline. These results underscore the promise of hybrid

scalability often hinge on effective parameter optimization, which remains
nontrivial due to rugged energy landscapes and hardware noise. In this work, we
introduce a quantum meta-learning framework that combines quantum neural
networks, specifically Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) architectures,
with QAOA. By training the QLSTM optimizer on smaller graph instances, our
approach rapidly generalizes to larger, more complex problems, substantially
reducing the number of iterations required for convergence. Through
comprehensive benchmarks on Max-Cut and Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model
instances, we demonstrate that QLSTM-based optimizers converge faster and
achieve higher approximation ratios compared to classical baselines, thereby
offering a robust pathway toward scalable quantum optimization in the NISQ era.

Abstract: This paper presents a general framework for conducting efficient and robust
inference on parameters derived from unstructured data, which include text,
images, audio, and video. Economists have long incorporated data extracted from
texts and images into their analyses, a practice that has accelerated with
advancements in deep neural networks. However, neural networks do not
generically produce unbiased predictions, potentially propagating bias to
estimators that use their outputs. To address this challenge, we reframe
inference with unstructured data as a missing structured data problem, where
structured data are imputed from unstructured inputs using deep neural
networks. This perspective allows us to apply classic results from
semiparametric inference, yielding valid, efficient, and robust estimators
based on unstructured data. We formalize this approach with MARS (Missing At
Random Structured Data), a unifying framework that integrates and extends
existing methods for debiased inference using machine learning predictions,
linking them to a variety of older, familiar problems such as causal inference.
We develop robust and efficient estimators for both descriptive and causal
estimands and address challenges such as inference using aggregated and
transformed predictions from unstructured data. Importantly, MARS applies to
common empirical settings that have received limited attention in the existing
literature. Finally, we reanalyze prominent studies that use unstructured data,
demonstrating the practical value of MARS.

### [242] [Pre-Training Estimators for Structural Models: Application to Consumer Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00526)
*Yanhao 'Max' Wei,Zhenling Jiang*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种预训练的结构计量经济学模型估计器，通过神经网络识别参数，显著降低了后续应用的算力和人力成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决结构模型估计中计算成本高和研究者投入大的问题，使结构模型更易于使用。

Method: 利用神经网络从数据模式中识别结构模型的参数，并以顺序搜索模型为初始试验。

Result: 在14个真实数据集上测试，估计速度快且准确度高。

Conclusion: 预训练的现成估计器可以提升结构模型的可访问性。

Abstract: We explore pretraining estimators for structural econometric models. The
estimator is "pretrained" in the sense that the bulk of the computational cost
and researcher effort occur during the construction of the estimator.
Subsequent applications of the estimator to different datasets require little
computational cost or researcher effort. The estimation leverages a neural net
to recognize the structural model's parameter from data patterns. As an initial
trial, this paper builds a pretrained estimator for a sequential search model
that is known to be difficult to estimate. We evaluate the pretrained estimator
on 14 real datasets. The estimation takes seconds to run and shows high
accuracy. We provide the estimator at pnnehome.github.io. More generally,
pretrained, off-the-shelf estimators can make structural models more accessible
to researchers and practitioners.

Then, we show that an estimator of a parameter for each edge in a directed

computational experiments with the expectation and maximization (EM) algorithm
and quadratic optimization.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of offline policy learning in
reinforcement learning with continuous action spaces when unmeasured
confounders are present. While most existing research focuses on policy
evaluation within partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and
assumes discrete action spaces, we advance this field by establishing a novel
identification result to enable the nonparametric estimation of policy value
for a given target policy under an infinite-horizon framework. Leveraging this
identification, we develop a minimax estimator and introduce a
policy-gradient-based algorithm to identify the in-class optimal policy that
maximizes the estimated policy value. Furthermore, we provide theoretical
results regarding the consistency, finite-sample error bound, and regret bound
of the resulting optimal policy. Extensive simulations and a real-world
application using the German Family Panel data demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed methodology.

Abstract: Robust estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects is a fundamental
challenge for optimal decision-making in domains ranging from personalized
medicine to educational policy. In recent years, predictive machine learning
has emerged as a valuable toolbox for causal estimation, enabling more flexible
effect estimation. However, accurately estimating conditional average treatment
effects (CATE) remains a major challenge, particularly in the presence of many
covariates. In this article, we propose pretraining strategies that leverages a
phenomenon in real-world applications: factors that are prognostic of the
outcome are frequently also predictive of treatment effect heterogeneity. In
medicine, for example, components of the same biological signaling pathways
frequently influence both baseline risk and treatment response. Specifically,
we demonstrate our approach within the R-learner framework, which estimates the
CATE by solving individual prediction problems based on a residualized loss. We
use this structure to incorporate "side information" and develop models that
can exploit synergies between risk prediction and causal effect estimation. In
settings where these synergies are present, this cross-task learning enables
more accurate signal detection: yields lower estimation error, reduced false
discovery rates, and higher power for detecting heterogeneity.

Result: 在模拟数据上验证了框架的有效性，并在流行病学数据中检测到非线性交互作用。

Conclusion: RuleSHAP为复杂模式的发现和推断提供了有效工具。

Abstract: In epidemiological settings, Machine Learning (ML) is gaining popularity for
hypothesis-free discovery of risk (or protective) factors. Although ML is
strong at discovering non-linearities and interactions, this power is currently
compromised by a lack of reliable inference. Although local measures of feature
effect can be combined with tree ensembles, uncertainty quantifications for
these measures remain only partially available and oftentimes unsatisfactory.
We propose RuleSHAP, a framework for using rule-based, hypothesis-free
discovery that combines sparse Bayesian regression, tree ensembles and Shapley
values in a one-step procedure that both detects and tests complex patterns at
the individual level. To ease computation, we derive a formula that computes
marginal Shapley values more efficiently for our setting. We demonstrate the
validity of our framework on simulated data. To illustrate, we apply our
machinery to data from an epidemiological cohort to detect and infer several
effects for high cholesterol and blood pressure, such as nonlinear interaction
effects between features like age, sex, ethnicity, BMI and glucose level.

Abstract: Existing theoretical work on Bayes-optimal fair classifiers usually considers
a single (binary) sensitive feature. In practice, individuals are often defined
by multiple sensitive features. In this paper, we characterize the
Bayes-optimal fair classifier for multiple sensitive features under general
approximate fairness measures, including mean difference and mean ratio. We
show that these approximate measures for existing group fairness notions,
including Demographic Parity, Equal Opportunity, Predictive Equality, and
Accuracy Parity, are linear transformations of selection rates for specific
groups defined by both labels and sensitive features. We then characterize that
Bayes-optimal fair classifiers for multiple sensitive features become
instance-dependent thresholding rules that rely on a weighted sum of these
group membership probabilities. Our framework applies to both attribute-aware
and attribute-blind settings and can accommodate composite fairness notions
like Equalized Odds. Building on this, we propose two practical algorithms for
Bayes-optimal fair classification via in-processing and post-processing. We
show empirically that our methods compare favorably to existing methods.
