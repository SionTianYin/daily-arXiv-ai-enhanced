### [2] [Dialogic Social Learning for Artificial Agents: Enhancing LLM Ontology Acquisition through Mixed-Initiative Educational Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21065)
*Sabrina Patania,Luca Annese,Cansu Koyuturk,Azzurra Ruggeri,Dimitri Ognibene*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探索了通过社会中介学习范式（如AI Social Gym）提升大语言模型（LLM）在线知识获取能力，发现双向对话教学策略优于单向教学和直接知识访问。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI训练范式依赖大数据集和稀疏反馈，限制了模型从交互中高效学习的能力，研究从Vygotsky的社会文化理论中汲取灵感，探索社会中介学习的潜力。

Method: 引入动态环境'AI Social Gym'，学习者AI与教师AI进行双向教学对话，重点研究不同教学策略对本体获取的影响。

Result: 双向对话策略（结合自上而下解释与学习者提问）显著提升LLM获取和应用新知识的能力，优于单向教学和直接知识访问。

Conclusion: 将教学和心理洞察融入AI训练可显著提升知识获取和响应质量，为现有策略（如提示工程）提供补充路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
processing extensive offline datasets. However, they often face challenges in
acquiring and integrating complex, knowledge online. Traditional AI training
paradigms, predominantly based on supervised learning or reinforcement
learning, mirror a 'Piagetian' model of independent exploration. These
approaches typically rely on large datasets and sparse feedback signals,
limiting the models' ability to learn efficiently from interactions. Drawing
inspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, this study explores the
potential of socially mediated learning paradigms to address these limitations.
  We introduce a dynamic environment, termed the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI
learner agent engages in dyadic pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI
teacher agents. These interactions emphasize external, structured dialogue as a
core mechanism for knowledge acquisition, contrasting with methods that depend
solely on internal inference or pattern recognition.
  Our investigation focuses on how different pedagogical strategies impact the
AI learning process in the context of ontology acquisition. Empirical results
indicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving
mixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with
learner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to
acquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional
instructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats
typically present in training datasets.
  These findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological
insights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training
knowledge acquisition and response quality. This approach offers a
complementary pathway to existing strategies like prompt engineering

### [3] [Product vs. Process: Exploring EFL Students' Editing of AI-Generated Text for Expository Writing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21073)
*David James Woo,Yangyang Yu,Kai Guo,Yilin Huang,April Ka Yeng Fung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了EFL中学生如何编辑AI生成的文本，发现编辑行为与写作质量提升关联不大，AI支持但不替代写作技能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成的文本在EFL写作中应用增多，但其对学生写作过程和成果的影响尚不明确。

Method: 39名香港中学生使用AI聊天机器人写作，通过屏幕录制和文本分析研究编辑行为和写作质量。

Result: AI生成字数对评分有正面影响，但编辑行为对质量提升作用有限。

Conclusion: 需结合体裁教学和过程写作，评估应重视过程和成果，以促进对AI文本的批判性使用。

Abstract: Text generated by artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots is increasingly used
in English as a foreign language (EFL) writing contexts, yet its impact on
students' expository writing process and compositions remains understudied.
This research examines how EFL secondary students edit AI-generated text.
Exploring editing behaviors in their expository writing process and in
expository compositions, and their effect on human-rated scores for content,
organization, language, and overall quality. Participants were 39 Hong Kong
secondary students who wrote an expository composition with AI chatbots in a
workshop. A convergent design was employed to analyze their screen recordings
and compositions to examine students' editing behaviors and writing qualities.
Analytical methods included qualitative coding, descriptive statistics,
temporal sequence analysis, human-rated scoring, and multiple linear regression
analysis. We analyzed over 260 edits per dataset, and identified two editing
patterns: one where students refined introductory units repeatedly before
progressing, and another where they quickly shifted to extensive edits in body
units (e.g., topic and supporting sentences). MLR analyses revealed that the
number of AI-generated words positively predicted all score dimensions, while
most editing variables showed minimal impact. These results suggest a
disconnect between students' significant editing effort and improved
composition quality, indicating AI supports but does not replace writing
skills. The findings highlight the importance of genre-specific instruction and
process-focused writing before AI integration. Educators should also develop
assessments valuing both process and product to encourage critical engagement
with AI text.

### [4] [Which symbol grounding problem should we try to solve?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21080)
*Vincent C. Müller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Floridi和Taddeo提出了解决基础问题的“零语义承诺”条件及其解决方案，但作者认为该条件无法实现，包括他们自己的方案。通过对比Luc Steels的不同建议，作者提出需要重新思考问题本质及系统中“目标”的作用。基于对计算的正确理解，作者认为唯一有意义的基础问题是如何解释和复现人工计算代理中意义的行为能力和功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Floridi和Taddeo提出的“零语义承诺”条件及其解决方案的可行性，并对比其他观点，重新定义基础问题的核心。

Method: 分析Floridi和Taddeo的条件与方案，对比Luc Steels的建议，并从计算的角度重新思考问题。

Result: Floridi和Taddeo的条件无法实现，基础问题应聚焦于人工计算代理中意义的行为能力和功能的解释与复现。

Conclusion: 唯一有意义的基础问题是如何解释和复现人工计算代理中意义的行为能力和功能。

Abstract: Floridi and Taddeo propose a condition of "zero semantic commitment" for
solutions to the grounding problem, and a solution to it. I argue briefly that
their condition cannot be fulfilled, not even by their own solution. After a
look at Luc Steels' very different competing suggestion, I suggest that we need
to re-think what the problem is and what role the 'goals' in a system play in
formulating the problem. On the basis of a proper understanding of computing, I
come to the conclusion that the only sensible grounding problem is how we can
explain and re-produce the behavioral ability and function of meaning in
artificial computational agents

### [5] [ChatGPT Reads Your Tone and Responds Accordingly -- Until It Does Not -- Emotional Framing Induces Bias in LLM Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21083)
*Franck Bardol*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GPT-4的回应受问题情感语调影响，负面问题引发更少负面回应，存在“反弹”偏差，敏感话题中更明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究情感语调如何影响GPT-4的回应，揭示潜在偏差及其对AI对齐和信任的影响。

Method: 系统变化156个提示的情感语调，分析模型回应，引入“语调下限”和语调-效价转换矩阵。

Result: GPT-4对负面问题的负面回应概率低三倍，敏感话题中语调变化被抑制。

Conclusion: 情感语调驱动的偏差是未充分探索的问题，对AI对齐和信任有重要启示。

Abstract: Large Language Models like GPT-4 adjust their responses not only based on the
question asked, but also on how it is emotionally phrased. We systematically
vary the emotional tone of 156 prompts - spanning controversial and everyday
topics - and analyze how it affects model responses. Our findings show that
GPT-4 is three times less likely to respond negatively to a negatively framed
question than to a neutral one. This suggests a "rebound" bias where the model
overcorrects, often shifting toward neutrality or positivity. On sensitive
topics (e.g., justice or politics), this effect is even more pronounced:
tone-based variation is suppressed, suggesting an alignment override. We
introduce concepts like the "tone floor" - a lower bound in response negativity
- and use tone-valence transition matrices to quantify behavior. Visualizations
based on 1536-dimensional embeddings confirm semantic drift based on tone. Our
work highlights an underexplored class of biases driven by emotional framing in
prompts, with implications for AI alignment and trust. Code and data are
available at: https://github.com/bardolfranck/llm-responses-viewer

### [6] [Reviving Your MNEME: Predicting The Side Effects of LLM Unlearning and Fine-Tuning via Sparse Model Diffing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21084)
*Aly M. Kassem,Zhuan Shi,Negar Rostamzadeh,Golnoosh Farnadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MNEME框架通过稀疏模型差异分析，检测LLMs微调或遗忘后的副作用，准确率达95%，并提供部分逆转方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法全面评估LLMs在微调或遗忘后的副作用，尤其是不可预测或突发的行为变化。

Method: 提出MNEME框架，通过任务无关数据比较基础模型与微调模型，识别行为变化。

Result: 在五种LLMs和三种场景中，MNEME预测副作用的准确率达95%，且无需自定义启发式。

Conclusion: 稀疏探测和差异分析为理解和管理LLM行为提供了可扩展的自动化工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned or unlearned to adapt
to new tasks or eliminate undesirable behaviors. While existing evaluation
methods assess performance after such interventions, there remains no general
approach for detecting unintended side effects, such as unlearning biology
content degrading performance on chemistry tasks, particularly when these
effects are unpredictable or emergent. To address this issue, we introduce
MNEME, Model diffiNg for Evaluating Mechanistic Effects, a lightweight
framework for identifying these side effects using sparse model diffing. MNEME
compares base and fine-tuned models on task-agnostic data (for example, The
Pile, LMSYS-Chat-1M) without access to fine-tuning data to isolate behavioral
shifts. Applied to five LLMs across three scenarios: WMDP knowledge unlearning,
emergent misalignment, and benign fine-tuning, MNEME achieves up to 95 percent
accuracy in predicting side effects, aligning with known benchmarks and
requiring no custom heuristics. Furthermore, we show that retraining on
high-activation samples can partially reverse these effects. Our results
demonstrate that sparse probing and diffing offer a scalable and automated lens
into fine-tuning-induced model changes, providing practical tools for
understanding and managing LLM behavior.

### [7] [Multi-Amateur Contrastive Decoding for Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21086)
*Jaydip Sen,Subhasis Dasgupta,Hetvi Waghela*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multi-Amateur Contrastive Decoding (MACD) 通过使用多个业余模型扩展了对比解码（CD），以更全面地捕捉语言生成中的失败模式，提升生成文本的流畅性、连贯性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的对比解码依赖单一业余模型，无法全面捕捉语言生成中的多样化失败模式（如重复、幻觉和风格漂移）。

Method: MACD 使用多个业余模型，通过平均和共识惩罚机制整合对比信号，并扩展了合理性约束以适应多业余模型设置。

Result: 实验表明，MACD 在多个领域（如新闻、百科和叙事）中均优于传统解码方法和原始 CD 方法。

Conclusion: MACD 在不需额外训练或微调的情况下，显著提升了文本生成的流畅性、连贯性、多样性和可控性。

Abstract: Contrastive Decoding (CD) has emerged as an effective inference-time strategy
for enhancing open-ended text generation by exploiting the divergence in output
probabilities between a large expert language model and a smaller amateur
model. Although CD improves coherence and fluency, its dependence on a single
amateur restricts its capacity to capture the diverse and multifaceted failure
modes of language generation, such as repetition, hallucination, and stylistic
drift. This paper proposes Multi-Amateur Contrastive Decoding (MACD), a
generalization of the CD framework that employs an ensemble of amateur models
to more comprehensively characterize undesirable generation patterns. MACD
integrates contrastive signals through both averaging and consensus
penalization mechanisms and extends the plausibility constraint to operate
effectively in the multi-amateur setting. Furthermore, the framework enables
controllable generation by incorporating amateurs with targeted stylistic or
content biases. Experimental results across multiple domains, such as news,
encyclopedic, and narrative, demonstrate that MACD consistently surpasses
conventional decoding methods and the original CD approach in terms of fluency,
coherence, diversity, and adaptability, all without requiring additional
training or fine-tuning.

### [8] [QU-NLP at CheckThat! 2025: Multilingual Subjectivity in News Articles Detection using Feature-Augmented Transformer Models with Sequential Cross-Lingual Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21095)
*Mohammad AL-Smadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合预训练语言模型与统计和语言特征的方法，用于检测新闻句子中的主观性，并在多语言和零样本设置中取得了竞争性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决新闻文章中句子主观性检测的挑战，区分作者主观观点与客观描述。

Method: 采用特征增强的Transformer架构，结合预训练模型的上下文嵌入与统计和语言特征，使用AraELECTRA（阿拉伯语）和跨语言DeBERTa~V3（其他语言）并加入TF-IDF特征和门控机制。

Result: 在单语言和多语言设置中表现优异，英语、德语、阿拉伯语和罗马尼亚语排名靠前，零样本设置中罗马尼亚语排名第一。

Conclusion: 结合TF-IDF特征和门控机制以及跨语言迁移对主观性检测至关重要，模型对跨语言微调顺序和训练语言的语系接近性敏感。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach to the CheckThat! 2025 Task 1 on
subjectivity detection, where systems are challenged to distinguish whether a
sentence from a news article expresses the subjective view of the author or
presents an objective view on the covered topic. We propose a feature-augmented
transformer architecture that combines contextual embeddings from pre-trained
language models with statistical and linguistic features. Our system leveraged
pre-trained transformers with additional lexical features: for Arabic we used
AraELECTRA augmented with part-of-speech (POS) tags and TF-IDF features, while
for the other languages we fine-tuned a cross-lingual DeBERTa~V3 model combined
with TF-IDF features through a gating mechanism. We evaluated our system in
monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot settings across multiple languages
including English, Arabic, German, Italian, and several unseen languages. The
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving competitive
performance across different languages with notable success in the monolingual
setting for English (rank 1st with macro-F1=0.8052), German (rank 3rd with
macro-F1=0.8013), Arabic (rank 4th with macro-F1=0.5771), and Romanian (rank
1st with macro-F1=0.8126) in the zero-shot setting. We also conducted an
ablation analysis that demonstrated the importance of combining TF-IDF features
with the gating mechanism and the cross-lingual transfer for subjectivity
detection. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the model's sensitivity to both
the order of cross-lingual fine-tuning and the linguistic proximity of the
training languages.

### [9] [Rewrite-to-Rank: Optimizing Ad Visibility via Retrieval-Aware Text Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21099)
*Chloe Ho,Ishneet Sukhvinder Singh,Diya Sharma,Tanvi Reddy Anumandla,Michael Lu,Vasu Sharma,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何通过LLM重写广告内容提升其在检索系统中的排名和生成响应中的可见性，提出了一种平衡语义相关性和内容保真度的监督微调框架，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索广告内容措辞对广告可见性的影响，特别是在LLM集成检索系统中。

Method: 提出监督微调框架，结合自定义损失函数平衡语义相关性和内容保真度，并引入DeltaMRR@K和DeltaDIR@K作为评估指标。

Result: 实验表明，PPO训练的模型在大多数情况下优于提示工程和监督微调，最高提升2.79 DeltaDIR@5和0.0073 DeltaMRR@5。

Conclusion: 广告措辞、提示格式和强化学习对LLM集成检索系统中的广告重写效果至关重要。

Abstract: Search algorithms and user query relevance have given LLMs the ability to
return relevant information, but the effect of content phrasing on ad
visibility remains underexplored. We investigate how LLM-based rewriting of
advertisements can improve their ranking in retrieval systems and inclusion in
generated LLM responses, without modifying the retrieval model itself. We
introduce a supervised fine-tuning framework with a custom loss balancing
semantic relevance and content fidelity. To evaluate effectiveness, we propose
two metrics: DeltaMRR@K (ranking improvement) and DeltaDIR@K (inclusion
frequency improvement). Our approach presents a scalable method to optimize ad
phrasing, enhancing visibility in retrieval-based LLM workflows. Experiments
across both instruction-based and few-shot prompting demonstrate that PPO
trained models outperform both prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning in
most cases, achieving up to a 2.79 DeltaDIR@5 and 0.0073 DeltaMRR@5 in
instruction-based prompting. These results highlight the importance of how the
ad is written before retrieval and prompt format and reinforcement learning in
effective ad rewriting for LLM integrated retrieval systems.

Conclusion: iLSU T数据集为手语翻译和理解研究提供了重要资源，强调了本地化数据的必要性。

Abstract: Automatic sign language translation has gained particular interest in the
computer vision and computational linguistics communities in recent years.
Given each sign language country particularities, machine translation requires
local data to develop new techniques and adapt existing ones. This work
presents iLSU T, an open dataset of interpreted Uruguayan Sign Language RGB
videos with audio and text transcriptions. This type of multimodal and curated
data is paramount for developing novel approaches to understand or generate
tools for sign language processing. iLSU T comprises more than 185 hours of
interpreted sign language videos from public TV broadcasting. It covers diverse
topics and includes the participation of 18 professional interpreters of sign
language. A series of experiments using three state of the art translation
algorithms is presented. The aim is to establish a baseline for this dataset
and evaluate its usefulness and the proposed pipeline for data processing. The
experiments highlight the need for more localized datasets for sign language
translation and understanding, which are critical for developing novel tools to
improve accessibility and inclusion of all individuals. Our data and code can
be accessed.

### [11] [Creation of a Numerical Scoring System to Objectively Measure and Compare the Level of Rhetoric in Arabic Texts: A Feasibility Study, and A Working Prototype](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21106)
*Mandar Marathe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究旨在开发一种工具，用于客观测量阿拉伯语修辞在文本中的密度，填补了现有研究中缺乏量化方法的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语修辞学缺乏客观的量化方法，无法比较不同文本、作者或时代的修辞使用情况。

Method: 研究编制了84种常见修辞手法的清单，开发了识别和计算修辞密度的系统，并创建了电子和模拟工具。

Result: 成功开发了一个工具，能够准确报告任何阿拉伯语文本或演讲中的修辞密度。

Conclusion: 该工具为阿拉伯语修辞研究提供了客观的量化方法，填补了研究空白。

Abstract: Arabic Rhetoric is the field of Arabic linguistics which governs the art and
science of conveying a message with greater beauty, impact and persuasiveness.
The field is as ancient as the Arabic language itself and is found extensively
in classical and contemporary Arabic poetry, free verse and prose. In practical
terms, it is the intelligent use of word order, figurative speech and
linguistic embellishments to enhance message delivery. Despite the volumes that
have been written about it and the high status accorded to it, there is no way
to objectively know whether a speaker or writer has used Arabic rhetoric in a
given text, to what extent, and why. There is no objective way to compare the
use of Arabic rhetoric across genres, authors or epochs. It is impossible to
know which of pre-Islamic poetry, Andalucian Arabic poetry, or modern literary
genres are richer in Arabic rhetoric. The aim of the current study was to
devise a way to measure the density of the literary devices which constitute
Arabic rhetoric in a given text, as a proxy marker for Arabic rhetoric itself.
A comprehensive list of 84 of the commonest literary devices and their
definitions was compiled. A system of identifying literary devices in texts was
constructed. A method of calculating the density of literary devices based on
the morpheme count of the text was utilised. Four electronic tools and an
analogue tool were created to support the calculation of an Arabic text's
rhetorical literary device density, including a website and online calculator.
Additionally, a technique of reporting the distribution of literary devices
used across the three sub-domains of Arabic rhetoric was created. The output of
this project is a working tool which can accurately report the density of
Arabic rhetoric in any Arabic text or speech.

### [12] [Curved Inference: Concern-Sensitive Geometry in Large Language Model Residual Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21107)
*Rob Manson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种几何可解释性框架Curved Inference，通过分析大型语言模型的残差流轨迹在语义关注变化下的弯曲情况，揭示了模型如何在不同语义领域中导航和调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在语义关注变化下的内部激活轨迹，以理解其如何编码和调整语义结构。

Method: 使用Gemma3-1b和LLaMA3.2-3b模型，通过20个匹配提示（涵盖情感、道德、逻辑等领域），计算曲率和显著性指标，基于解嵌入矩阵的语义度量进行分析。

Result: 发现语义关注变化会显著改变模型的激活轨迹，LLaMA在曲率和显著性上表现出更强的响应，而Gemma的区分能力较弱。

Conclusion: 支持了LLM几何的两层观点，揭示了模型如何通过Curved Inference导航和调整语义，为诊断模型对齐和抽象提供了新方法。

Abstract: We propose Curved Inference - a geometric Interpretability framework that
tracks how the residual stream trajectory of a large language model bends in
response to shifts in semantic concern. Across 20 matched prompts spanning
emotional, moral, perspective, logical, identity, environmental, and nonsense
domains, we analyse Gemma3-1b and LLaMA3.2-3b using five native-space metrics,
with a primary focus on curvature (\k{appa}_i) and salience (S(t)). These
metrics are computed under a pullback semantic metric derived from the
unembedding matrix, ensuring that all measurements reflect token-aligned
geometry rather than raw coordinate structure. We find that concern-shifted
prompts reliably alter internal activation trajectories in both models - with
LLaMA exhibiting consistent, statistically significant scaling in both
curvature and salience as concern intensity increases. Gemma also responds to
concern but shows weaker differentiation between moderate and strong variants.
Our results support a two-layer view of LLM geometry - a latent conceptual
structure encoded in the embedding space, and a contextual trajectory shaped by
prompt-specific inference. Curved Inference reveals how models navigate,
reorient, or reinforce semantic meaning over depth, offering a principled
method for diagnosing alignment, abstraction, and emergent inference dynamics.
These findings offer fresh insight into semantic abstraction and model
alignment through the lens of Curved Inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于合同规模大、复杂度高，人工审核效率低且易出错，因此需要自动化方法提升法律合同分析的效率、准确性和可访问性。

Method: 论文提出了LCC的方法论分类，包括传统机器学习、深度学习和基于Transformer的方法，并详细讨论了相关数据集和评估技术。

Result: 总结了现有方法的最佳性能结果，并指出了当前方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 该综述为法律NLP研究者和从业者提供了全面的参考，旨在推动法律信息更易获取，促进社会的公平与透明。

Abstract: Given the large size and volumes of contracts and their underlying inherent
complexity, manual reviews become inefficient and prone to errors, creating a
clear need for automation. Automatic Legal Contract Classification (LCC)
revolutionizes the way legal contracts are analyzed, offering substantial
improvements in speed, accuracy, and accessibility. This survey delves into the
challenges of automatic LCC and a detailed examination of key tasks, datasets,
and methodologies. We identify seven classification tasks within LCC, and
review fourteen datasets related to English-language contracts, including
public, proprietary, and non-public sources. We also introduce a methodology
taxonomy for LCC, categorized into Traditional Machine Learning, Deep Learning,
and Transformer-based approaches. Additionally, the survey discusses evaluation
techniques and highlights the best-performing results from the reviewed
studies. By providing a thorough overview of current methods and their
limitations, this survey suggests future research directions to improve the
efficiency, accuracy, and scalability of LCC. As the first comprehensive survey
on LCC, it aims to support legal NLP researchers and practitioners in improving
legal processes, making legal information more accessible, and promoting a more
informed and equitable society.

Motivation: 现有方法在将领域知识整合到大型语言模型时存在计算成本高、易过拟合和可扩展性差的问题，SemRAG旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用基于句子嵌入余弦相似度的语义分块算法，减少计算开销；通过知识图谱结构化检索信息，提升检索准确性和上下文理解。

Result: 在MultiHop RAG和Wikipedia数据集上，SemRAG显著提升了检索信息的相关性和正确性，优于传统RAG方法。

Conclusion: SemRAG提供了一种高效、准确的领域特定LLM解决方案，无需资源密集型微调，具有实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: This paper introduces SemRAG, an enhanced Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG) framework that efficiently integrates domain-specific knowledge using
semantic chunking and knowledge graphs without extensive fine-tuning.
Integrating domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs) is
crucial for improving their performance in specialized tasks. Yet, existing
adaptations are computationally expensive, prone to overfitting and limit
scalability. To address these challenges, SemRAG employs a semantic chunking
algorithm that segments documents based on the cosine similarity from sentence
embeddings, preserving semantic coherence while reducing computational
overhead. Additionally, by structuring retrieved information into knowledge
graphs, SemRAG captures relationships between entities, improving retrieval
accuracy and contextual understanding. Experimental results on MultiHop RAG and
Wikipedia datasets demonstrate SemRAG has significantly enhances the relevance
and correctness of retrieved information from the Knowledge Graph,
outperforming traditional RAG methods. Furthermore, we investigate the
optimization of buffer sizes for different data corpus, as optimizing buffer
sizes tailored to specific datasets can further improve retrieval performance,
as integration of knowledge graphs strengthens entity relationships for better
contextual comprehension. The primary advantage of SemRAG is its ability to
create an efficient, accurate domain-specific LLM pipeline while avoiding
resource-intensive fine-tuning. This makes it a practical and scalable approach
aligned with sustainability goals, offering a viable solution for AI
applications in domain-specific fields.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了自然语言处理（NLP）在保险业中的应用，展示了如何将非结构化文本转化为结构化数据，以支持精算分析和决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着InsurTech的快速发展，传统保险公司需要利用替代数据源和先进技术保持竞争力。

Method: 通过实际案例研究，应用多种NLP技术处理非结构化文本数据，并结合传统保险数据源进行分析。

Result: NLP不仅补充了传统评级因素，还通过引入新的行业分类提供了风险评估的新视角。

Conclusion: NLP是现代数据驱动保险分析的基础工具，而不仅仅是辅助手段。

Abstract: With the rapid rise of InsurTech, traditional insurance companies are
increasingly exploring alternative data sources and advanced technologies to
sustain their competitive edge. This paper provides both a conceptual overview
and practical case studies of natural language processing (NLP) and its
emerging applications within insurance operations with a focus on transforming
raw, unstructured text into structured data suitable for actuarial analysis and
decision-making. Leveraging real-world alternative data provided by an
InsurTech industry partner that enriches traditional insurance data sources, we
apply various NLP techniques to demonstrate practical use cases in the
commercial insurance context. These enriched, text-derived insights not only
add to and refine traditional rating factors for commercial insurance pricing
but also offer novel perspectives for assessing underlying risk by introducing
novel industry classifications. Through these demonstrations, we show that NLP
is not merely a supplementary tool but a foundational element for modern,
data-driven insurance analytics.

*Zheng Hui,Yijiang River Dong,Ehsan Shareghi,Nigel Collier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Trident-Bench，一个针对法律、金融和医学领域的大语言模型（LLM）安全评估基准，填补了领域特定安全风险评估的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在法律、金融和医学等高风险领域的广泛应用，评估其领域特定安全性变得至关重要。以往研究多关注性能提升，而忽略了安全性评估。

Method: 基于AMA医学伦理、ABA职业行为准则和CFA道德准则，定义了领域特定安全原则，并开发了Trident-Bench基准，评估了19个通用和领域专用模型。

Result: 结果显示，通用模型（如GPT、Gemini）能满足基本要求，而领域专用模型在细微伦理问题上表现不佳，揭示了领域特定安全改进的紧迫性。

Conclusion: Trident-Bench为研究LLM在专业领域的安全性提供了系统资源，为未来减少LLM部署风险奠定了基础。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-risk
domains such as law, finance, and medicine, systematically evaluating their
domain-specific safety and compliance becomes critical. While prior work has
largely focused on improving LLM performance in these domains, it has often
neglected the evaluation of domain-specific safety risks. To bridge this gap,
we first define domain-specific safety principles for LLMs based on the AMA
Principles of Medical Ethics, the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, and
the CFA Institute Code of Ethics. Building on this foundation, we introduce
Trident-Bench, a benchmark specifically targeting LLM safety in the legal,
financial, and medical domains. We evaluated 19 general-purpose and
domain-specialized models on Trident-Bench and show that it effectively reveals
key safety gaps -- strong generalist models (e.g., GPT, Gemini) can meet basic
expectations, whereas domain-specialized models often struggle with subtle
ethical nuances. This highlights an urgent need for finer-grained
domain-specific safety improvements. By introducing Trident-Bench, our work
provides one of the first systematic resources for studying LLM safety in law
and finance, and lays the groundwork for future research aimed at reducing the
safety risks of deploying LLMs in professionally regulated fields. Code and
benchmark will be released at: https://github.com/zackhuiiiii/TRIDENT

Abstract: We introduce Inworld TTS-1, a set of two Transformer-based autoregressive
text-to-speech (TTS) models. Our largest model, TTS-1-Max, has 8.8B parameters
and is designed for utmost quality and expressiveness in demanding
applications. TTS-1 is our most efficient model, with 1.6B parameters, built

RL-alignment of the speech-language model (SpeechLM) component, both models
achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of benchmarks, demonstrating
exceptional quality relying purely on in-context learning of the speaker's
voice. Inworld TTS-1 and TTS-1-Max can generate high-resolution 48 kHz speech
with low latency, and support 11 languages with fine-grained emotional control
and non-verbal vocalizations through audio markups. We additionally open-source
our training and modeling code under an MIT license.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何有效利用多样性提升LLMs在二元问题中的表现。

Method: 比较模型多样性和问题解释多样性，采用多数投票作为集成共识策略。

Result: 问题解释多样性在boolq、strategyqa和pubmedqa上表现更优，模型多样性效果介于最佳和最差成员之间。

Conclusion: 问题解释多样性是更有效的多样性利用方式。

Abstract: Effectively leveraging diversity has been shown to improve performance for
various machine learning models, including large language models (LLMs).
However, determining the most effective way of using diversity remains a
challenge. In this work, we compare two diversity approaches for answering
binary questions using LLMs: model diversity, which relies on multiple models
answering the same question, and question interpretation diversity, which
relies on using the same model to answer the same question framed in different
ways. For both cases, we apply majority voting as the ensemble consensus
heuristic to determine the final answer. Our experiments on boolq, strategyqa,
and pubmedqa show that question interpretation diversity consistently leads to
better ensemble accuracy compared to model diversity. Furthermore, our analysis
of GPT and LLaMa shows that model diversity typically produces results between
the best and the worst ensemble members without clear improvement.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Contrast-CAT的新方法，通过对比激活过滤掉类别无关特征，提高了Transformer模型在文本分类中的解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型的决策解释性不足，影响了其在实际应用中的可信度和安全性。现有的激活归因方法容易受到类别无关特征的干扰。

Method: 提出Contrast-CAT方法，通过对比输入序列的激活与参考激活，过滤掉类别无关特征，生成更清晰的归因图。

Result: 实验表明，Contrast-CAT在多个数据集和模型上表现优于现有方法，在MoRF设置下AOPC和LOdds指标分别提升1.30倍和2.25倍。

Conclusion: Contrast-CAT显著提升了Transformer模型在文本分类任务中的解释性，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解释工具。

Abstract: Transformers have profoundly influenced AI research, but explaining their
decisions remains challenging -- even for relatively simpler tasks such as
classification -- which hinders trust and safe deployment in real-world
applications. Although activation-based attribution methods effectively explain
transformer-based text classification models, our findings reveal that these
methods can be undermined by class-irrelevant features within activations,
leading to less reliable interpretations. To address this limitation, we
propose Contrast-CAT, a novel activation contrast-based attribution method that
refines token-level attributions by filtering out class-irrelevant features. By
contrasting the activations of an input sequence with reference activations,
Contrast-CAT generates clearer and more faithful attribution maps. Experimental
results across various datasets and models confirm that Contrast-CAT
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Notably, under the MoRF
setting, it achieves average improvements of x1.30 in AOPC and x2.25 in LOdds
over the most competing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing
interpretability for transformer-based text classification.

Method: 构建包含28,528条孟加拉语评论的数据集，使用XLM-RoBERTa Base架构的Transformer模型进行分类，并应用可解释AI技术。

Result: 模型分类准确率达97%，优于现有方法，并识别出影响情感分类的关键特征。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在低资源语言（如孟加拉语）处理中表现优异，可为公共政策制定和犯罪预防提供支持。

Abstract: In recent years, social media platforms have become prominent spaces for
individuals to express their opinions on ongoing events, including criminal
incidents. As a result, public sentiment can shift dynamically over time. This
study investigates the evolving public perception of crime-related news by
classifying user-generated comments into three categories: positive, negative,
and neutral. A newly curated dataset comprising 28,528 Bangla-language social
media comments was developed for this purpose. We propose a transformer-based
model utilizing the XLM-RoBERTa Base architecture, which achieves a
classification accuracy of 97%, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods
in Bangla sentiment analysis. To enhance model interpretability, explainable AI
technique is employed to identify the most influential features driving
sentiment classification. The results underscore the effectiveness of
transformer-based models in processing low-resource languages such as Bengali
and demonstrate their potential to extract actionable insights that can support
public policy formulation and crime prevention strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在孟加拉语等低资源语言中，缺乏有效的自然语言处理方法来检测超党派新闻，导致偏见内容传播，影响公共话语。

Method: 研究通过微调Bangla BERT模型，结合半监督学习和LIME解释工具，提升分类准确性和透明度。

Result: Bangla BERT在试验数据中表现优异，准确率达到95.65%，显著优于传统机器学习模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明，即使在资源有限的环境中，基于Transformer的模型也能有效提升超党派新闻检测的准确性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: In the current digital landscape, misinformation circulates rapidly, shaping
public perception and causing societal divisions. It is difficult to identify
hyperpartisan news in Bangla since there aren't many sophisticated natural
language processing methods available for this low-resource language. Without
effective detection methods, biased content can spread unchecked, posing
serious risks to informed discourse. To address this gap, our research
fine-tunes Bangla BERT. This is a state-of-the-art transformer-based model,
designed to enhance classification accuracy for hyperpartisan news. We evaluate
its performance against traditional machine learning models and implement
semi-supervised learning to enhance predictions further. Not only that, we use
LIME to provide transparent explanations of the model's decision-making
process, which helps to build trust in its outcomes. With a remarkable accuracy
score of 95.65%, Bangla BERT outperforms conventional approaches, according to
our trial data. The findings of this study demonstrate the usefulness of
transformer models even in environments with limited resources, which opens the
door to further improvements in this area.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究了人类临床解释是否能提升基于Transformer的模型在临床文本分类中的性能和可解释性，发现其在高资源场景下有效，但在低资源下不一致，且不如直接使用更多报告数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类临床解释作为额外监督信号是否能提升模型性能和可解释性。

Method: 使用99,125条人类临床解释和128,649份电子病理报告训练Transformer模型，并评估其对癌症原发部位的提取能力，同时测试解释质量度量方法的有效性。

Result: 临床解释在高资源场景下提升性能，但在低资源下不一致；使用更多报告数据优于使用解释数据。

Conclusion: 若目标是优化准确性，应优先标注更多报告而非生成解释；若需可解释性，解释数据可能有助于模型识别类似特征。

Abstract: AI-driven clinical text classification is vital for explainable automated
retrieval of population-level health information. This work investigates
whether human-based clinical rationales can serve as additional supervision to
improve both performance and explainability of transformer-based models that
automatically encode clinical documents. We analyzed 99,125 human-based
clinical rationales that provide plausible explanations for primary cancer site
diagnoses, using them as additional training samples alongside 128,649
electronic pathology reports to evaluate transformer-based models for
extracting primary cancer sites. We also investigated sufficiency as a way to
measure rationale quality for pre-selecting rationales. Our results showed that
clinical rationales as additional training data can improve model performance
in high-resource scenarios but produce inconsistent behavior when resources are
limited. Using sufficiency as an automatic metric to preselect rationales also
leads to inconsistent results. Importantly, models trained on rationales were
consistently outperformed by models trained on additional reports instead. This
suggests that clinical rationales don't consistently improve model performance
and are outperformed by simply using more reports. Therefore, if the goal is
optimizing accuracy, annotation efforts should focus on labeling more reports
rather than creating rationales. However, if explainability is the priority,
training models on rationale-supplemented data may help them better identify
rationale-like features. We conclude that using clinical rationales as
additional training data results in smaller performance improvements and only
slightly better explainability (measured as average token-level rationale
coverage) compared to training on additional reports.

TL;DR: 研究发现当前大语言模型（LLMs）在捕捉跨文化道德差异方面表现不佳，倾向于压缩差异且与实证调查数据对齐度低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能够准确反映跨文化道德视角的差异与相似性，以解决其训练数据中潜在的偏见问题。

Method: 采用三种方法：比较模型与调查数据的道德分数方差、聚类对齐分析、以及通过系统选择的词对直接测试模型。

Result: LLMs未能完全重现跨文化道德差异，且与调查数据的对齐度较低。

Conclusion: 需开发更稳健的方法以减少偏见并提升LLMs的文化代表性，强调公平与伦理对齐的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have established them as
powerful tools across numerous domains. However, persistent concerns about
embedded biases, such as gender, racial, and cultural biases arising from their
training data, raise significant questions about the ethical use and societal
consequences of these technologies. This study investigates the extent to which
LLMs capture cross-cultural differences and similarities in moral perspectives.
Specifically, we examine whether LLM outputs align with patterns observed in
international survey data on moral attitudes. To this end, we employ three
complementary methods: (1) comparing variances in moral scores produced by
models versus those reported in surveys, (2) conducting cluster alignment
analyses to assess correspondence between country groupings derived from LLM
outputs and survey data, and (3) directly probing models with comparative
prompts using systematically chosen token pairs. Our results reveal that
current LLMs often fail to reproduce the full spectrum of cross-cultural moral
variation, tending to compress differences and exhibit low alignment with
empirical survey patterns. These findings highlight a pressing need for more
robust approaches to mitigate biases and improve cultural representativeness in
LLMs. We conclude by discussing the implications for the responsible
development and global deployment of LLMs, emphasizing fairness and ethical
alignment.

Conclusion: 研究表明深度学习能有效提升低资源语言的ASR性能，为Shona等语言的可及性和沟通提供了技术支持。

Abstract: This study presented the development of a deep learning-based Automatic
Speech Recognition system for Shona, a low-resource language characterized by
unique tonal and grammatical complexities. The research aimed to address the
challenges posed by limited training data, lack of labelled data, and the
intricate tonal nuances present in Shona speech, with the objective of
achieving significant improvements in recognition accuracy compared to
traditional statistical models. The research first explored the feasibility of
using deep learning to develop an accurate ASR system for Shona. Second, it
investigated the specific challenges involved in designing and implementing
deep learning architectures for Shona speech recognition and proposed
strategies to mitigate these challenges. Lastly, it compared the performance of
the deep learning-based model with existing statistical models in terms of
accuracy. The developed ASR system utilized a hybrid architecture consisting of
a Convolutional Neural Network for acoustic modelling and a Long Short-Term
Memory network for language modelling. To overcome the scarcity of data, data
augmentation techniques and transfer learning were employed. Attention
mechanisms were also incorporated to accommodate the tonal nature of Shona
speech. The resulting ASR system achieved impressive results, with a Word Error
Rate of 29%, Phoneme Error Rate of 12%, and an overall accuracy of 74%. These
metrics indicated the potential of deep learning to enhance ASR accuracy for
under-resourced languages like Shona. This study contributed to the advancement
of ASR technology for under-resourced languages like Shona, ultimately
fostering improved accessibility and communication for Shona speakers
worldwide.

Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型（LLM）在从自然语言提取结构化信息时缺乏特定领域或组织的评估基准，手动标注成本高且难以扩展。

Method: StructText采用两阶段“计划-执行”流程，利用表格数据生成自然语言文本，并通过LLM和客观指标进行多维度评估。

Result: 在71,539个示例和49个数据集上的评估显示，LLM在事实准确性上表现良好，但在叙述连贯性上存在挑战，数值和时间信息提取准确但难以自动化。

Conclusion: StructText提供了一个包含数据集、评估工具和基线系统的框架，支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Extracting structured information from text, such as key-value pairs that
could augment tabular data, is quite useful in many enterprise use cases.
Although large language models (LLMs) have enabled numerous automated pipelines
for converting natural language into structured formats, there is still a lack
of benchmarks for evaluating their extraction quality, especially in specific
domains or focused documents specific to a given organization. Building such
benchmarks by manual annotations is labour-intensive and limits the size and
scalability of the benchmarks. In this work, we present StructText, an
end-to-end framework for automatically generating high-fidelity benchmarks for
key-value extraction from text using existing tabular data. It uses available
tabular data as structured ground truth, and follows a two-stage
``plan-then-execute'' pipeline to synthetically generate corresponding
natural-language text. To ensure alignment between text and structured source,
we introduce a multi-dimensional evaluation strategy that combines (a)
LLM-based judgments on factuality, hallucination, and coherence and (b)
objective extraction metrics measuring numeric and temporal accuracy. We
evaluated the proposed method on 71,539 examples across 49 datasets. Results
reveal that while LLMs achieve strong factual accuracy and avoid hallucination,
they struggle with narrative coherence in producing extractable text. Notably,
models presume numerical and temporal information with high fidelity yet this
information becomes embedded in narratives that resist automated extraction. We
release a framework, including datasets, evaluation tools, and baseline
extraction systems, to support continued research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网页自动化方法忽略了历史状态的重要性，且冗长的网页状态导致输入序列过长和信息稀疏，影响历史状态的有效利用。

Method: 采用历史压缩模块，从每个历史状态中提取任务相关信息，生成固定长度的短表示。

Result: 在Mind2Web和WebLINX数据集上实验显示，相比无历史输入的基线方法，准确性提高了1.2-5.4%。

Conclusion: 提出的历史压缩方法有效解决了冗长历史状态的问题，显著提升了网页自动化的性能。

Abstract: Language models have led to a leap forward in web automation. The current web
automation approaches take the current web state, history actions, and language
instruction as inputs to predict the next action, overlooking the importance of
history states. However, the highly verbose nature of web page states can
result in long input sequences and sparse information, hampering the effective
utilization of history states. In this paper, we propose a novel web history
compressor approach to turbocharge web automation using history states. Our
approach employs a history compressor module that distills the most
task-relevant information from each history state into a fixed-length short
representation, mitigating the challenges posed by the highly verbose history
states. Experiments are conducted on the Mind2Web and WebLINX datasets to
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that our approach
obtains 1.2-5.4% absolute accuracy improvements compared to the baseline
approach without history inputs.

TL;DR: MemTool是一个短期记忆框架，帮助LLM代理在多轮对话中动态管理工具或MCP服务器上下文，提供三种模式（自主代理、工作流和混合模式），并在实验中展示了不同模式在工具移除效率和任务完成准确性上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定上下文窗口限制了LLM代理在多轮交互中的有效性，尤其是在需要重复独立使用工具的情况下。

Method: 引入MemTool框架，提供三种代理架构：自主代理模式、工作流模式和混合模式，并在ScaleMCP基准上评估其性能。

Result: 自主代理模式在大型LLM中工具移除效率高（90-94%），而中小型模型效率较低（0-60%）；工作流和混合模式在工具移除上表现稳定，自主和混合模式在任务完成上更优。

Conclusion: MemTool为不同任务需求提供了灵活的模式选择，需根据任务准确性、代理能力和模型性能权衡使用。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown significant autonomous
capabilities in dynamically searching and incorporating relevant tools or Model
Context Protocol (MCP) servers for individual queries. However, fixed context
windows limit effectiveness in multi-turn interactions requiring repeated,
independent tool usage. We introduce MemTool, a short-term memory framework
enabling LLM agents to dynamically manage tools or MCP server contexts across
multi-turn conversations. MemTool offers three agentic architectures: 1)
Autonomous Agent Mode, granting full tool management autonomy, 2) Workflow
Mode, providing deterministic control without autonomy, and 3) Hybrid Mode,
combining autonomous and deterministic control. Evaluating each MemTool mode
across 13+ LLMs on the ScaleMCP benchmark, we conducted experiments over 100
consecutive user interactions, measuring tool removal ratios (short-term memory
efficiency) and task completion accuracy. In Autonomous Agent Mode, reasoning
LLMs achieve high tool-removal efficiency (90-94% over a 3-window average),
while medium-sized models exhibit significantly lower efficiency (0-60%).
Workflow and Hybrid modes consistently manage tool removal effectively, whereas
Autonomous and Hybrid modes excel at task completion. We present trade-offs and
recommendations for each MemTool mode based on task accuracy, agency, and model
capabilities.

evaluate models generated reasoning using BERTopic for topic modelling and a
novel Explanation Strength Index, providing the first structured analysis of
how LLMs articulate decision factors in alignment with behavioural theory.
LiTransMC, fine-tuned using parameter efficient and loss masking strategy,
achieved a weighted F1 score of 0.6845 and a Jensen-Shannon Divergence of
0.000245, surpassing both untuned local models and larger proprietary systems,
including GPT-4o with advanced persona inference and embedding-based loading,
while also outperforming classical mode choice methods such as discrete choice
models and machine learning classifiers for the same dataset. This dual
improvement, i.e., high instant-level accuracy and near-perfect distributional
calibration, demonstrates the feasibility of creating specialist, locally
deployable LLMs that integrate prediction and interpretability. Through
combining structured behavioural prediction with natural language reasoning,
this work unlocks the potential for conversational, multi-task transport models
capable of supporting agent-based simulations, policy testing, and behavioural
insight generation. These findings establish a pathway for transforming general
purpose LLMs into specialized, explainable tools for transportation research
and policy formulation, while maintaining privacy, reducing cost, and
broadening access through local deployment.

TL;DR: HumorBench是一个评估大语言模型（LLM）在理解卡通字幕幽默能力的基准，包含300个卡通-字幕对和专家标注的评分标准。结果显示LLM在STEM推理的进步能有效转移到幽默理解，且推理能力具有强迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在数学和科学领域的基准逐渐饱和，需要新颖且具有挑战性的评估来衡量模型在非STEM领域（如幽默理解）的智能表现。

Method: HumorBench包含约300个卡通-字幕对，专家标注了关键幽默元素。LLM通过解释幽默和识别笑话元素的能力进行评估。

Result: 研究发现：（1）LLM在STEM推理的进步能有效转移到幽默理解；（2）仅训练于STEM数据的模型在幽默理解上表现良好；（3）增加推理令牌预算对幽默推理的效果因模型而异。

Conclusion: HumorBench为评估LLM在复杂幽默理解中的推理能力提供了新工具，并展示了推理能力的广泛迁移性。

Abstract: We present HumorBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate large language
models' (LLMs) ability to reason about and explain sophisticated humor in
cartoon captions. As reasoning models increasingly saturate existing benchmarks
in mathematics and science, novel and challenging evaluations of model
intelligence beyond STEM domains are essential. Reasoning is fundamentally
involved in text-based humor comprehension, requiring the identification of
connections between concepts in cartoons/captions and external cultural
references, wordplays, and other mechanisms. HumorBench includes approximately
300 unique cartoon-caption pairs from the New Yorker Caption Contest and
Cartoonstock.com, with expert-annotated evaluation rubrics identifying
essential joke elements. LLMs are evaluated based on their explanations towards
the humor and abilities in identifying the joke elements. To perform well on
this task, models must form and test hypotheses about associations between
concepts, potentially backtracking from initial interpretations to arrive at
the most plausible explanation. Our extensive benchmarking of current SOTA
models reveals three key insights: (1) LLM progress on STEM reasoning transfers
effectively to humor comprehension; (2) models trained exclusively on STEM
reasoning data still perform well on HumorBench, demonstrating strong
transferability of reasoning abilities; and (3) test-time scaling by increasing
thinking token budgets yields mixed results across different models in humor
reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于任务多样性的高效标注学习方法，通过逆置信度加权策略选择样本，显著降低了标注成本，同时提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决监督微调中标注成本高的问题，利用任务多样性和预训练模型的置信度差异，提出更高效的数据选择方法。

Method: 采用逆置信度加权策略选择样本，充分利用任务标签和预训练模型的置信度差异。

Result: 在MMLU任务上准确率提升4%，标注成本降低80%，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 任务多样性策略在高效标注学习中表现优异，显著降低标注成本并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, but developing high-performing models for specialized
applications often requires substantial human annotation -- a process that is
time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive. In this paper, we address the
label-efficient learning problem for supervised finetuning (SFT) by leveraging
task-diversity as a fundamental principle for effective data selection. This is
markedly different from existing methods based on the prompt-diversity. Our
approach is based on two key observations: 1) task labels for different prompts
are often readily available; 2) pre-trained models have significantly varying
levels of confidence across tasks. We combine these facts to devise a simple
yet effective sampling strategy: we select examples across tasks using an
inverse confidence weighting strategy. This produces models comparable to or
better than those trained with more complex sampling procedures, while being
significantly easier to implement and less computationally intensive. Notably,
our experimental results demonstrate that this method can achieve better
accuracy than training on the complete dataset (a 4\% increase in MMLU score).
Across various annotation budgets and two instruction finetuning datasets, our
algorithm consistently performs at or above the level of the best existing
methods, while reducing annotation costs by up to 80\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越南缺乏大规模测试数据集，阻碍了AI模型的有效评估和部署。

Method: 利用大型语言模型和先进嵌入模型翻译并过滤英语样本，确保语言流畅性和语义保真度。

Result: 构建了包含41个数据集的越南语基准测试VN-MTEB，发现使用旋转位置嵌入的复杂模型表现更优。

Conclusion: VN-MTEB为越南语嵌入模型提供了有效的评估工具，推动了相关研究和应用。

Abstract: Vietnam ranks among the top countries in terms of both internet traffic and
online toxicity. As a result, implementing embedding models for recommendation
and content control duties in applications is crucial. However, a lack of
large-scale test datasets, both in volume and task diversity, makes it tricky
for scientists to effectively evaluate AI models before deploying them in
real-world, large-scale projects. To solve this important problem, we introduce
a Vietnamese benchmark, VN-MTEB for embedding models, which we created by
translating a large number of English samples from the Massive Text Embedding
Benchmark using our new automated framework. We leverage the strengths of large
language models (LLMs) and cutting-edge embedding models to conduct translation
and filtering processes to retain high-quality samples, guaranteeing a natural
flow of language and semantic fidelity while preserving named entity
recognition (NER) and code snippets. Our comprehensive benchmark consists of 41
datasets from six tasks specifically designed for Vietnamese text embeddings.
In our analysis, we find that bigger and more complex models using Rotary
Positional Embedding outperform those using Absolute Positional Embedding in
embedding tasks. Datasets are available at HuggingFace:

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在交互中可能偏离‘助人、无害、诚实’理想状态的问题，探索如何监测和干预这些偏离。

Method: 识别模型激活空间中的人设向量，用于预测和控制性格变化，并提出预防性干预方法。

Result: 人设向量能有效监测和预测性格变化，并通过干预方法避免或减轻不良变化。

Conclusion: 人设向量是一种自动化、通用的方法，可用于监测和控制模型性格变化，提升模型可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models interact with users through a simulated 'Assistant'
persona. While the Assistant is typically trained to be helpful, harmless, and
honest, it sometimes deviates from these ideals. In this paper, we identify
directions in the model's activation space-persona vectors-underlying several
traits, such as evil, sycophancy, and propensity to hallucinate. We confirm
that these vectors can be used to monitor fluctuations in the Assistant's
personality at deployment time. We then apply persona vectors to predict and
control personality shifts that occur during training. We find that both
intended and unintended personality changes after finetuning are strongly
correlated with shifts along the relevant persona vectors. These shifts can be
mitigated through post-hoc intervention, or avoided in the first place with a
new preventative steering method. Moreover, persona vectors can be used to flag
training data that will produce undesirable personality changes, both at the
dataset level and the individual sample level. Our method for extracting
persona vectors is automated and can be applied to any personality trait of
interest, given only a natural-language description.

*Tuan Vu Ho,Hiroaki Kokubo,Masaaki Yamamoto,Yohei Kawaguchi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Token Map Drafting的无模型推测解码技术，用于加速基于Transformer的端到端自动语音识别（ASR）系统在CPU设备上的推理速度，同时保持转录准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的ASR系统（如Whisper）的自回归解码计算成本高，限制了其在CPU设备上的部署。现有的推测解码方法需要额外的草案模型，对硬件要求高。

Method: 提出Token Map Drafting技术，利用预计算的n-gram令牌映射替代草案模型，实现高效推测解码。

Result: 实验显示，在CI-AVSR数据集上解码速度提升1.27倍，内部数据集提升1.37倍，且未降低准确性。在CPU上比Distill-spec基线快10%。

Conclusion: Token Map Drafting是一种适用于低困惑度领域的高效推测解码方法，显著提升了ASR在资源受限设备上的推理速度。

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems based on transformer
architectures, such as Whisper, offer high transcription accuracy and
robustness. However, their autoregressive decoding is computationally
expensive, hence limiting deployment on CPU-based and resource-constrained
devices. Speculative decoding (SD) mitigates this issue by using a smaller
draft model to propose candidate tokens, which are then verified by the main
model. However, this approach is impractical for devices lacking hardware
accelerators like GPUs. To address this, we propose \emph{Token Map Drafting},
a model-free SD technique that eliminates the need for a separate draft model.
Instead, we leverage a precomputed n-gram token map derived from
domain-specific training data, enabling efficient speculative decoding with
minimal overhead. Our method significantly accelerates ASR inference in
structured, low-perplexity domains without sacrificing transcription accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate decoding speed-ups of $1.27\times$ on the
CI-AVSR dataset and $1.37\times$ on our internal dataset without degrading
recognition accuracy. Additionally, our approach achieves a $10\%$ absolute
improvement in decoding speed over the Distill-spec baseline running on CPU,
highlighting its effectiveness for on-device ASR applications.

TL;DR: TriangleMix是一种无需训练的静态注意力模式，通过在浅层使用密集注意力、深层切换为三角形稀疏模式，显著降低计算开销，同时保持模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有静态稀疏注意力方法精度下降和动态稀疏方法计算开销大的问题。

Method: 在浅层使用密集注意力，深层采用三角形稀疏模式，无需额外训练。

Result: 在深层减少注意力开销3.7x至15.3x，整体TTFT降低12%至32%，精度无损。

Conclusion: TriangleMix能高效提升LLM推理效率，并可与其他动态稀疏方法结合进一步加速。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on attention mechanisms whose time
complexity grows quadratically with input sequence length, creating significant
computational bottlenecks during the prefilling stage. Existing static sparse
attention methods typically degrade accuracy, while dynamic sparsity methods
introduce additional computational overhead due to runtime sparse index
estimation. To address these limitations, we propose TriangleMix, a novel
training-free static attention pattern. TriangleMix employs dense attention in
shallow layers and switches to a triangle-shaped sparse pattern in deeper
layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TriangleMix reduces attention
overhead by 3.7x to 15.3x in deep layers, and decreases overall
Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by 12% to 32% for sequence lengths ranging from 32K
to 128K, without sacrificing model accuracy. Moreover, TriangleMix can be
seamlessly integrated with dynamic sparsity methods to achieve further speedup,
e.g. accelerating MInference by 19% at 128K, highlighting its potential to
enhance LLM inference efficiency.

Motivation: NLP技术在需求工程中的应用日益广泛，但相关研究的可复现性未得到足够关注。论文旨在通过复制和扩展研究，验证和提升NLP4RE研究的可复现性。

Method: 复制了基线研究的深度学习模型评估，并扩展了外部数据集和GPT-4零样本分类器的比较。

Result: 不同模型的可复现性差异显著，BERT和ELMo表现出良好的泛化能力，GPT-4性能与传统基线模型相当。

Conclusion: 研究验证了基线研究的可复现性，并提供了缺失的环境设置文件，以支持未来研究的复现。

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have been widely applied in the
requirements engineering (RE) field to support tasks such as classification and
ambiguity detection. Although RE research is rooted in empirical investigation,
it has paid limited attention to replicating NLP for RE (NLP4RE) studies. The
rapidly advancing realm of NLP is creating new opportunities for efficient,
machine-assisted workflows, which can bring new perspectives and results to the
forefront. Thus, we replicate and extend a previous NLP4RE study (baseline),
"Classifying User Requirements from Online Feedback in Small Dataset
Environments using Deep Learning", which evaluated different deep learning
models for requirement classification from user reviews. We reproduced the
original results using publicly released source code, thereby helping to
strengthen the external validity of the baseline study. We then extended the
setup by evaluating model performance on an external dataset and comparing
results to a GPT-4o zero-shot classifier. Furthermore, we prepared the
replication study ID-card for the baseline study, important for evaluating
replication readiness. Results showed diverse reproducibility levels across
different models, with Naive Bayes demonstrating perfect reproducibility. In
contrast, BERT and other models showed mixed results. Our findings revealed
that baseline deep learning models, BERT and ELMo, exhibited good
generalization capabilities on an external dataset, and GPT-4o showed
performance comparable to traditional baseline machine learning models.
Additionally, our assessment confirmed the baseline study's replication
readiness; however missing environment setup files would have further enhanced
readiness. We include this missing information in our replication package and
provide the replication study ID-card for our study to further encourage and
support the replication of our study.

Method: 设计了包含18种主关系和26种子类型的标注框架，并通过预训练的通用依赖解析器进行跨标准评估。

Result: 发现通用标注方案与维吾尔语特定结构存在47.9%的系统性差异，证明了定制化方法的必要性。

Conclusion: 现代维吾尔语依赖树库（MUDT）提供了更准确、语义透明的表示，为其他形态复杂语言提供了可复制的模型。

Abstract: To address a critical resource gap in Uyghur Natural Language Processing
(NLP), this study introduces a dependency annotation framework designed to
overcome the limitations of existing treebanks for the low-resource,
agglutinative language. This inventory includes 18 main relations and 26
subtypes, with specific labels such as cop:zero for verbless clauses and
instr:case=loc/dat for nuanced instrumental functions. To empirically validate
the necessity of this tailored approach, we conducted a cross-standard
evaluation using a pre-trained Universal Dependencies parser. The analysis
revealed a systematic 47.9% divergence in annotations, pinpointing the
inadequacy of universal schemes for handling Uyghur-specific structures.
Grounded in nine annotation principles that ensure typological accuracy and
semantic transparency, the Modern Uyghur Dependency Treebank (MUDT) provides a
more accurate and semantically transparent representation, designed to enable
significant improvements in parsing and downstream NLP tasks, and offers a
replicable model for other morphologically complex languages.

Motivation: 现有基准在知识冲突研究中存在局限性，如问题回答场景单一、依赖实体替换技术、冲突类型有限。

Method: 采用知识图谱框架生成多样化冲突，确保可解释性。

Result: 实验显示开源和专有LLM在冲突检测和多跳推理上表现不佳，难以定位矛盾源。

Conclusion: 为改进LLM整合多样化（甚至冲突）信息提供了基础分析。

Abstract: Knowledge conflict often arises in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems, where retrieved documents may be inconsistent with one another or
contradict the model's parametric knowledge. Existing benchmarks for
investigating the phenomenon have notable limitations, including a narrow focus
on the question answering setup, heavy reliance on entity substitution
techniques, and a restricted range of conflict types. To address these issues,
we propose a knowledge graph (KG)-based framework that generates varied and
subtle conflicts between two similar yet distinct contexts, while ensuring
interpretability through the explicit relational structure of KGs. Experimental
results on our benchmark, MAGIC, provide intriguing insights into the inner
workings of LLMs regarding knowledge conflict: both open-source and proprietary
models struggle with conflict detection -- especially when multi-hop reasoning
is required -- and often fail to pinpoint the exact source of contradictions.
Finally, we present in-depth analyses that serve as a foundation for improving
LLMs in integrating diverse, sometimes even conflicting, information.

Method: 采用与人类研究相同的分析框架，评估模型在自然、低频和高频动词分布条件下的表现。

Result: 模型在词干和后缀准确率上优于人类，但反应偏好不同；模型受训练数据中不规则动词比例影响，且对音系相似性敏感。

Conclusion: 模型与人类在语言处理上存在显著差异，尤其是在反应偏好和训练数据影响方面。

Abstract: This study investigates the cognitive plausibility of the Spanish irregular
morphomic pattern by directly comparing transformer-based neural networks to
human behavioral data from \citet{Nevins2015TheRA}. Using the same analytical
framework as the original human study, we evaluate whether transformer models
can replicate human-like sensitivity to a complex linguistic phenomena, the
morphome, under controlled input conditions. Our experiments focus on three
frequency conditions: natural, low-frequency, and high-frequency distributions
of verbs exhibiting irregular morphomic patterns. While the models outperformed
humans in stem and suffix accuracy, a clear divergence emerged in response
preferences. Unlike humans, who consistently favored natural responses across
all test items, models' preferred irregular responses and were influenced by
the proportion of irregular verbs in their training data. Additionally, models
trained on the natural and low-frequency distributions, but not the
high-frequency distribution, were sensitive to the phonological similarity
between test items and real Spanish L-shaped verbs.

Result: 低资源语言中，采样方法虽略微降低翻译质量，但增加了多样性和词汇丰富性，提升了学生模型性能并减少性别偏见。

Conclusion: MHD方法通过多假设蒸馏有效提升了学生模型的学习效果，尤其在低资源语言中表现显著。

Abstract: This paper explores sequence-level knowledge distillation (KD) of
multilingual pre-trained encoder-decoder translation models. We argue that the
teacher model's output distribution holds valuable insights for the student,
beyond the approximated mode obtained through beam search (the standard
decoding method), and present Multi-Hypothesis Distillation (MHD), a
sequence-level KD method that generates multiple translations for each source
sentence. This provides a larger representation of the teacher model
distribution and exposes the student model to a wider range of target-side
prefixes. We leverage $n$-best lists from beam search to guide the student's
learning and examine alternative decoding methods to address issues like low
variability and the under-representation of infrequent tokens. For low-resource
languages, our research shows that while sampling methods may slightly
compromise translation quality compared to beam search based approaches, they
enhance the generated corpora with greater variability and lexical richness.
This ultimately improves student model performance and mitigates the gender
bias amplification often associated with KD.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了奖励模型在复杂推理中的局限性，为推理能力的持续提升提供了新方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly improved the reasoning ability
of large language models. However, current reward models underperform in
challenging reasoning scenarios and predominant RL training paradigms rely on
rule-based or reference-based rewards, which impose two critical limitations:
1) the dependence on finely annotated reference answer to attain rewards; and
2) the requirement for constrained output format. These limitations
fundamentally hinder further RL data scaling and sustained enhancement of model
reasoning performance. To address these limitations, we propose a comprehensive
framework for evaluating and improving the performance of reward models in
complex reasoning scenarios. We first present a reasoning-oriented benchmark
(Libra Bench), systematically constructed from a diverse collection of
challenging mathematical problems and advanced reasoning models, to address the
limitations of existing reward model benchmarks in reasoning scenarios. We
further introduce a novel approach for improving the generative reward model
via learning-to-think methodologies. Based on the proposed approach, we develop
Libra-RM series, a collection of generative reward models with reasoning
capabilities that achieve state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks.
Comprehensive downstream experiments are conducted and the experimental results
demonstrate the correlation between our Libra Bench and downstream application,
and the potential of Libra-RM to further improve reasoning models with
unlabeled data.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注过滤安全提示，而忽略了硬提示可能引发有害输出的问题。UnsafeChain旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 构建UnsafeChain数据集，包含多样化的硬提示及其纠正后的安全响应，并用于微调三个大型推理模型。

Result: UnsafeChain在多个基准测试中表现优于现有数据集，甚至1K子集也能匹配或超越基线性能。

Conclusion: 基于纠正的监督方法在提升模型安全性和泛化能力方面具有显著效果。

Abstract: As large reasoning models (LRMs) grow more capable, chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning introduces new safety challenges. Existing SFT-based safety alignment
studies dominantly focused on filtering prompts with safe, high-quality
responses, while overlooking hard prompts that always elicit harmful outputs.
To fill this gap, we introduce UnsafeChain, a safety alignment dataset
constructed from hard prompts with diverse sources, where unsafe completions
are identified and explicitly corrected into safe responses. By exposing models
to unsafe behaviors and guiding their correction, UnsafeChain enhances safety
while preserving general reasoning ability. We fine-tune three LRMs on
UnsafeChain and compare them against recent SafeChain and STAR-1 across six
out-of-distribution and five in-distribution benchmarks. UnsafeChain
consistently outperforms prior datasets, with even a 1K subset matching or
surpassing baseline performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and
generalizability of correction-based supervision. We release our dataset and

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have driven substantial progress in
natural language processing but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
raising concerns about their robustness in real-world applications. Previous
studies have sought to mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks by
introducing adversarial perturbations into the training process, either
implicitly or explicitly. While both strategies enhance robustness, they often
incur high computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
add-on module that enhances the adversarial robustness of PLMs by removing
instance-level principal components, without relying on conventional
adversarial defences or perturbing the original training data. Our approach
transforms the embedding space to approximate Gaussian properties, thereby
reducing its susceptibility to adversarial perturbations while preserving
semantic relationships. This transformation aligns embedding distributions in a
way that minimises the impact of adversarial noise on decision boundaries,
enhancing robustness without requiring adversarial examples or costly
training-time augmentation. Evaluations on eight benchmark datasets show that
our approach improves adversarial robustness while maintaining comparable
before-attack accuracy to baselines, achieving a balanced trade-off between
robustness and generalisation.

Motivation: 解决农业领域缺乏训练数据和评估基准的问题，推动农业大语言模型的发展。

Method: 构建AgriEval基准测试，包含多类题型和高质量数据，对51个大语言模型进行实验评估。

Result: 现有模型准确率普遍低于60%，表明农业领域大语言模型的发展潜力巨大。

Conclusion: AgriEval为农业领域提供了首个全面评估工具，揭示了模型的不足并提出了改进方向。

Abstract: In the agricultural domain, the deployment of large language models (LLMs) is
hindered by the lack of training data and evaluation benchmarks. To mitigate
this issue, we propose AgriEval, the first comprehensive Chinese agricultural
benchmark with three main characteristics: (1) Comprehensive Capability
Evaluation. AgriEval covers six major agriculture categories and 29
subcategories within agriculture, addressing four core cognitive scenarios:
memorization, understanding, inference, and generation. (2) High-Quality Data.
The dataset is curated from university-level examinations and assignments,
providing a natural and robust benchmark for assessing the capacity of LLMs to
apply knowledge and make expert-like decisions. (3) Diverse Formats and
Extensive Scale. AgriEval comprises 14,697 multiple-choice questions and 2,167
open-ended question-and-answer questions, establishing it as the most extensive
agricultural benchmark available to date. We also present comprehensive
experimental results over 51 open-source and commercial LLMs. The experimental
results reveal that most existing LLMs struggle to achieve 60% accuracy,
underscoring the developmental potential in agricultural LLMs. Additionally, we
conduct extensive experiments to investigate factors influencing model
performance and propose strategies for enhancement. AgriEval is available at

TL;DR: 研究大型语言模型（LLMs）的安全性分类模型在多语言环境中的有效性，揭示数据集问题并提出改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对LLMs的安全性测试研究较多，但对其安全分类器的评估及多语言场景下的研究较少。

Method: 通过分析覆盖18种语言的数据集，评估5个安全分类模型的多语言差异。

Result: 发现多语言差异及评估数据集的潜在问题，指出分类器不足不仅是模型本身的问题。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于改进多语言环境下LLM输入有害内容的识别方法。

Abstract: Studying the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to unsafe behaviors
is an important topic of research today. Building safety classification models
or guard models, which are fine-tuned models for input/output safety
classification for LLMs, is seen as one of the solutions to address the issue.
Although there is a lot of research on the safety testing of LLMs themselves,
there is little research on evaluating the effectiveness of such safety
classifiers or the evaluation datasets used for testing them, especially in
multilingual scenarios. In this position paper, we demonstrate how multilingual
disparities exist in 5 safety classification models by considering datasets
covering 18 languages. At the same time, we identify potential issues with the
evaluation datasets, arguing that the shortcomings of current safety
classifiers are not only because of the models themselves. We expect that these
findings will contribute to the discussion on developing better methods to
identify harmful content in LLM inputs across languages.

converting ChartMark specifications into Vega-Lite visualizations, highlighting

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在减少药物使用伤害信息提供中的表现，填补相关研究空白。

Method: 构建HRIP-Basic数据集（2,160个问答对），涵盖三个任务，并设计Instruction和RAG方案评估模型行为。

Result: 当前先进LLM在提供准确信息方面表现不佳，且存在严重安全风险。

Conclusion: 在减少伤害场景中使用LLM需谨慎，以避免负面健康后果。

Abstract: Millions of individuals' well-being are challenged by the harms of substance
use. Harm reduction as a public health strategy is designed to improve their
health outcomes and reduce safety risks. Some large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated a decent level of medical knowledge, promising to address the
information needs of people who use drugs (PWUD). However, their performance in
relevant tasks remains largely unexplored. We introduce HRIPBench, a benchmark
designed to evaluate LLM's accuracy and safety risks in harm reduction
information provision. The benchmark dataset HRIP-Basic has 2,160
question-answer-evidence pairs. The scope covers three tasks: checking safety
boundaries, providing quantitative values, and inferring polysubstance use
risks. We build the Instruction and RAG schemes to evaluate model behaviours
based on their inherent knowledge and the integration of domain knowledge. Our
results indicate that state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to provide accurate
harm reduction information, and sometimes, carry out severe safety risks to
PWUD. The use of LLMs in harm reduction contexts should be cautiously
constrained to avoid inducing negative health outcomes. WARNING: This paper
contains illicit content that potentially induces harms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解事件合理性变化对对话生成、常识推理和幻觉检测等任务至关重要，例如区分“温和讽刺”的真实意图。

Method: 使用句子Transformer对ADEPT挑战基准（16K英语句子对）进行建模实验。

Result: 句子Transformer和基于Transformer的模型在此任务上表现不佳，句子Transformer甚至不如RoBERTa。评估方法的不平衡影响了模型性能和结果可信度。

Conclusion: 需要更现实、平衡的评估方法以提高模型性能和结果的可信度。

Abstract: While the task of assessing the plausibility of events such as ''news is
relevant'' has been addressed by a growing body of work, less attention has
been paid to capturing changes in plausibility as triggered by event
modification. Understanding changes in plausibility is relevant for tasks such
as dialogue generation, commonsense reasoning, and hallucination detection as
it allows to correctly model, for example, ''gentle sarcasm'' as a sign of
closeness rather than unkindness among friends [9]. In this work, we tackle the
ADEPT challenge benchmark [6] consisting of 16K English sentence pairs
differing by exactly one adjectival modifier. Our modeling experiments provide
a conceptually novel method by using sentence transformers, and reveal that
both they and transformer-based models struggle with the task at hand, and
sentence transformers - despite their conceptual alignment with the task - even
under-perform in comparison to models like RoBERTa. Furthermore, an in-depth
comparison with prior work highlights the importance of a more realistic,
balanced evaluation method: imbalances distort model performance and evaluation
metrics, and weaken result trustworthiness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管研究者提出了多种提示策略，但其效果因模型和任务而异，目前仍依赖试错方法。HALC旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过发送1,512个提示并基于专家编码（ground truth）测试提示策略和LLM任务性能。

Result: 发现可靠编码单变量（αclimate = .76；αmovement = .78）和双变量（αclimate = .71；αmovement = .74）的提示。

Conclusion: HALC提供了不同提示策略的有效性、关键影响因素及可靠提示的识别方法。

Abstract: LLMs are seeing widespread use for task automation, including automated
coding in the social sciences. However, even though researchers have proposed
different prompting strategies, their effectiveness varies across LLMs and
tasks. Often trial and error practices are still widespread. We propose
HALC$-$a general pipeline that allows for the systematic and reliable
construction of optimal prompts for any given coding task and model, permitting
the integration of any prompting strategy deemed relevant. To investigate LLM
coding and validate our pipeline, we sent a total of 1,512 individual prompts
to our local LLMs in over two million requests. We test prompting strategies
and LLM task performance based on few expert codings (ground truth). When
compared to these expert codings, we find prompts that code reliably for single
variables (${\alpha}$climate = .76; ${\alpha}$movement = .78) and across two
variables (${\alpha}$climate = .71; ${\alpha}$movement = .74) using the LLM
Mistral NeMo. Our prompting strategies are set up in a way that aligns the LLM
to our codebook$-$we are not optimizing our codebook for LLM friendliness. Our
paper provides insights into the effectiveness of different prompting
strategies, crucial influencing factors, and the identification of reliable
prompts for each coding task and model.

TL;DR: AutoTIR是一个强化学习框架，使LLM能自主决定是否及何时调用外部工具，优化任务正确性和工具使用效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具集成方法依赖预定义模式，可能损害语言能力，AutoTIR受人类自适应选择工具启发，旨在提升灵活性和性能。

Method: AutoTIR通过混合奖励机制（任务正确性、结构化输出、惩罚错误工具使用）优化推理和工具集成。

Result: 在多种任务中，AutoTIR表现优于基线，工具使用行为泛化能力强。

Conclusion: 强化学习可构建通用、可扩展的TIR能力，AutoTIR展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), when enhanced through reasoning-oriented
post-training, evolve into powerful Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) further extends their capabilities by
incorporating external tools, but existing methods often rely on rigid,
predefined tool-use patterns that risk degrading core language competence.
Inspired by the human ability to adaptively select tools, we introduce AutoTIR,
a reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to autonomously decide
whether and which tool to invoke during the reasoning process, rather than
following static tool-use strategies. AutoTIR leverages a hybrid reward
mechanism that jointly optimizes for task-specific answer correctness,
structured output adherence, and penalization of incorrect tool usage, thereby
encouraging both precise reasoning and efficient tool integration. Extensive
evaluations across diverse knowledge-intensive, mathematical, and general
language modeling tasks demonstrate that AutoTIR achieves superior overall
performance, significantly outperforming baselines and exhibits superior
generalization in tool-use behavior. These results highlight the promise of
reinforcement learning in building truly generalizable and scalable TIR
capabilities in LLMs. The code and data are available at

TL;DR: Graph-R1通过端到端强化学习改进GraphRAG，解决了构建成本高、检索固定等问题，提升了推理准确性和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GraphRAG方法存在构建成本高、检索固定、依赖长上下文推理和提示设计等问题，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出Graph-R1框架，采用轻量级知识超图构建，将检索建模为多轮代理-环境交互，并通过端到端奖励机制优化。

Result: 在标准RAG数据集上，Graph-R1在推理准确性、检索效率和生成质量上优于传统GraphRAG和RL增强的RAG方法。

Conclusion: Graph-R1通过强化学习优化了GraphRAG的性能，为检索增强生成提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination in LLMs by
incorporating external knowledge, but relies on chunk-based retrieval that
lacks structural semantics. GraphRAG methods improve RAG by modeling knowledge
as entity-relation graphs, but still face challenges in high construction cost,
fixed one-time retrieval, and reliance on long-context reasoning and prompt
design. To address these challenges, we propose Graph-R1, an agentic GraphRAG
framework via end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL). It introduces lightweight
knowledge hypergraph construction, models retrieval as a multi-turn
agent-environment interaction, and optimizes the agent process via an
end-to-end reward mechanism. Experiments on standard RAG datasets show that
Graph-R1 outperforms traditional GraphRAG and RL-enhanced RAG methods in
reasoning accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and generation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索死记硬背是否真的阻碍泛化，以及LLMs是否可以通过特定框架从记忆数据中学习泛化。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：先使用无意义标记记忆事实关联，再通过少量语义提示微调以泛化。

Result: 8个LLM实验显示模型能通过语义提示重新解释记忆数据，形成结构化语义对齐的潜在表示。

Conclusion: 该发现为高效知识注入和潜在恶意数据利用提供了新视角。

Abstract: Rote learning is a memorization technique based on repetition. It is commonly
believed to hinder generalization by encouraging verbatim memorization rather
than deeper understanding. This insight holds for even learning factual
knowledge that inevitably requires a certain degree of memorization. In this
work, we demonstrate that LLMs can be trained to generalize from rote memorized
data. We introduce a two-phase memorize-then-generalize framework, where the
model first rote memorizes factual subject-object associations using a
semantically meaningless token and then learns to generalize by fine-tuning on
a small set of semantically meaningful prompts. Extensive experiments over 8
LLMs show that the models can reinterpret rote memorized data through the
semantically meaningful prompts, as evidenced by the emergence of structured,
semantically aligned latent representations between the two. This surprising
finding opens the door to both effective and efficient knowledge injection and
possible risks of repurposing the memorized data for malicious usage.

Motivation: 探讨AI语言模型在温暖性和可靠性之间的权衡，尤其是在用户表达脆弱时的表现。

Method: 对五种不同规模和架构的语言模型进行实验，训练它们生成更温暖的回应，并评估其在安全关键任务中的表现。

Result: 温暖模型在错误率上显著增加（+10到+30个百分点），更容易传播错误信息、阴谋论和提供有问题的医疗建议。

Conclusion: 当前评估方法可能无法检测到这些系统性风险，需重新思考如何开发和监督这些影响人类关系的AI系统。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) developers are increasingly building language
models with warm and empathetic personas that millions of people now use for
advice, therapy, and companionship. Here, we show how this creates a
significant trade-off: optimizing language models for warmth undermines their
reliability, especially when users express vulnerability. We conducted
controlled experiments on five language models of varying sizes and
architectures, training them to produce warmer, more empathetic responses, then
evaluating them on safety-critical tasks. Warm models showed substantially
higher error rates (+10 to +30 percentage points) than their original
counterparts, promoting conspiracy theories, providing incorrect factual
information, and offering problematic medical advice. They were also
significantly more likely to validate incorrect user beliefs, particularly when
user messages expressed sadness. Importantly, these effects were consistent
across different model architectures, and occurred despite preserved
performance on standard benchmarks, revealing systematic risks that current
evaluation practices may fail to detect. As human-like AI systems are deployed
at an unprecedented scale, our findings indicate a need to rethink how we
develop and oversee these systems that are reshaping human relationships and
social interaction.

Conclusion: RLSF证明了利用模型内在行为进行强化学习的有效性，为LLM后训练提供了数据高效的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce plausible but poorly-calibrated
answers, limiting their reliability on reasoning-intensive tasks. We present
Reinforcement Learning from Self-Feedback (RLSF), a post-training stage that
uses the model's own confidence as an intrinsic reward, mimicking how humans
learn in the absence of external feedback. After a frozen LLM generates several
chain-of-thought solutions, we define and compute the confidence of each final
answer span and rank the traces accordingly. These synthetic preferences are
then used to fine-tune the policy with standard preference optimization,
similar to RLHF yet requiring no human labels, gold answers, or externally
curated rewards.
  RLSF simultaneously (i) refines the model's probability estimates --
restoring well-behaved calibration -- and (ii) strengthens step-by-step
reasoning, yielding improved performance on arithmetic reasoning and
multiple-choice question answering.
  By turning a model's own uncertainty into useful self-feedback, RLSF affirms
reinforcement learning on intrinsic model behaviour as a principled and
data-efficient component of the LLM post-training pipeline and warrents further
research in intrinsic rewards for LLM post-training.

Motivation: 研究RAG在跨文化食谱适应中的局限性，尤其是其无法生成多样化输出的问题。

Method: 提出CARRIAGE框架，通过改进检索和上下文组织增强多样性。

Result: 实验显示CARRIAGE在多样性和质量上优于封闭式LLM。

Conclusion: CARRIAGE是首个明确追求多样化输出的RAG框架，有效解决了RAG的局限性。

Abstract: In cross-cultural recipe adaptation, the goal is not only to ensure cultural
appropriateness and retain the original dish's essence, but also to provide
diverse options for various dietary needs and preferences. Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) is a promising approach, combining the retrieval of real
recipes from the target cuisine for cultural adaptability with large language
models (LLMs) for relevance. However, it remains unclear whether RAG can
generate diverse adaptation results. Our analysis shows that RAG tends to
overly rely on a limited portion of the context across generations, failing to
produce diverse outputs even when provided with varied contextual inputs. This
reveals a key limitation of RAG in creative tasks with multiple valid answers:
it fails to leverage contextual diversity for generating varied responses. To
address this issue, we propose CARRIAGE, a plug-and-play RAG framework for
cross-cultural recipe adaptation that enhances diversity in both retrieval and
context organization. To our knowledge, this is the first RAG framework that
explicitly aims to generate highly diverse outputs to accommodate multiple user
preferences. Our experiments show that CARRIAGE achieves Pareto efficiency in
terms of diversity and quality of recipe adaptation compared to closed-book
LLMs.

Motivation: 传统机器学习模型在微生物组研究中难以泛化，尤其是在小样本或异构标签格式的情况下。

Method: 使用ChatGPT-4o、Claude 3.7 Sonnet等LLMs，在零样本和小样本设置下进行分类和预测，并与随机森林等传统模型对比。

Result: LLMs在分类和预测任务中均优于基线模型，且能泛化到不同站点和元数据分布。

Conclusion: LLMs能够有效处理稀疏、异构的生物元数据，为环境微生物学和生物监测提供了一种有前景的元数据驱动方法。

Abstract: Traditional machine learning models struggle to generalize in microbiome
studies where only metadata is available, especially in small-sample settings
or across studies with heterogeneous label formats. In this work, we explore
the use of large language models (LLMs) to classify microbial samples into
ontology categories such as EMPO 3 and related biological labels, as well as to
predict pathogen contamination risk, specifically the presence of E. Coli,
using environmental metadata alone. We evaluate LLMs such as ChatGPT-4o, Claude
3.7 Sonnet, Grok-3, and LLaMA 4 in zero-shot and few-shot settings, comparing
their performance against traditional models like Random Forests across
multiple real-world datasets. Our results show that LLMs not only outperform
baselines in ontology classification, but also demonstrate strong predictive
ability for contamination risk, generalizing across sites and metadata
distributions. These findings suggest that LLMs can effectively reason over
sparse, heterogeneous biological metadata and offer a promising metadata-only
approach for environmental microbiology and biosurveillance applications.

Result: 在异构源的多跳QA任务中，相比传统RAG方法，推理深度、检索精度和可解释性均有提升。

Conclusion: DeepSieve通过模块化和透明设计，显著提升了RAG框架的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many reasoning tasks but struggle with
knowledge-intensive queries due to their inability to dynamically access
up-to-date or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
has emerged as a promising solution, enabling LLMs to ground their responses in
external sources. However, existing RAG methods lack fine-grained control over
both the query and source sides, often resulting in noisy retrieval and shallow
reasoning. In this work, we introduce DeepSieve, an agentic RAG framework that
incorporates information sieving via LLM-as-a-knowledge-router. DeepSieve
decomposes complex queries into structured sub-questions and recursively routes
each to the most suitable knowledge source, filtering irrelevant information
through a multi-stage distillation process. Our design emphasizes modularity,
transparency, and adaptability, leveraging recent advances in agentic system
design. Experiments on multi-hop QA tasks across heterogeneous sources
demonstrate improved reasoning depth, retrieval precision, and interpretability
over conventional RAG approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于IMU的运动分析中缺乏大规模、多样化数据集的问题。

Method: 收集了19名参与者的物理治疗和步态数据，使用同步IMU和MoCap系统，并提供数据处理工具和模型。

Result: 提供了包含原始和处理数据的完整数据集，支持多种分析任务。

Conclusion: 该数据集和工具旨在加速机器学习在人类运动分析中的应用。

Abstract: Wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) offer a cost-effective and
scalable means to assess human movement quality in clinical and everyday
settings. However, the development of robust sensor-based classification models
for physiotherapeutic exercises and gait analysis requires large, diverse
datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to collect. Here, we present a
multimodal dataset of physiotherapeutic exercises - including correct and
clinically relevant variants - and gait-related exercises - including both
normal and impaired gait patterns - recorded from 19 participants using
synchronized IMUs and marker-based motion capture (MoCap). The dataset includes
raw data from nine IMUs and thirty-five optical markers capturing full-body
kinematics. Each IMU is additionally equipped with four optical markers,
enabling precise comparison between IMU-derived orientation estimates and
reference values from the MoCap system. To support further analysis, we also
provide processed IMU orientations aligned with common segment coordinate
systems, subject-specific OpenSim models, inverse kinematics results, and tools
for visualizing IMU orientations in the musculoskeletal context. Detailed
annotations of movement execution quality and time-stamped segmentations
support diverse analysis goals. This dataset supports the development and

TL;DR: BF-PIP是一种零样本方法，通过连续视频片段和结构化元数据预测行人意图，无需额外训练即可达到73%的准确率，优于GPT-4V基线18%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法需要大量重新训练以适应新场景的问题，提升复杂城市环境中行人意图预测的准确性。

Method: 基于Gemini 2.5 Pro，利用连续视频片段和JAAD元数据，结合边界框标注和自车速度的多模态提示。

Result: 在无需额外训练的情况下，预测准确率达到73%，比GPT-4V基线高18%。

Conclusion: 结合时间视频输入和上下文线索可增强时空感知，为智能交通系统提供无需重新训练的敏捷感知模块。

Abstract: Pedestrian intention prediction is essential for autonomous driving in
complex urban environments. Conventional approaches depend on supervised
learning over frame sequences and require extensive retraining to adapt to new
scenarios. Here, we introduce BF-PIP (Beyond Frames Pedestrian Intention
Prediction), a zero-shot approach built upon Gemini 2.5 Pro. It infers crossing
intentions directly from short, continuous video clips enriched with structured
JAAD metadata. In contrast to GPT-4V based methods that operate on discrete
frames, BF-PIP processes uninterrupted temporal clips. It also incorporates
bounding-box annotations and ego-vehicle speed via specialized multimodal
prompts. Without any additional training, BF-PIP achieves 73% prediction
accuracy, outperforming a GPT-4V baseline by 18 %. These findings illustrate
that combining temporal video inputs with contextual cues enhances
spatiotemporal perception and improves intent inference under ambiguous
conditions. This approach paves the way for agile, retraining-free perception
module in intelligent transportation system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖自然语言指令，模糊性高，难以支持细粒度图表编辑。

Method: 引入多模态图表编辑范式，结合自然语言和视觉指示器；构建ChartM3基准和训练集ChartM3-Train。

Result: 当前MLLMs（如GPT-4o）在视觉指示器解释和操作上存在局限；通过ChartM3-Train微调后性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 多模态监督对构建实用图表编辑系统至关重要，ChartM3为相关研究提供了数据和工具支持。

Abstract: Charts are a fundamental visualization format widely used in data analysis
across research and industry. While enabling users to edit charts based on
high-level intentions is of great practical value, existing methods primarily
rely on natural language instructions, which are often too ambiguous to support
fine-grained editing. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for
multimodal chart editing, where user intent is expressed through a combination
of natural language and visual indicators that explicitly highlight the
elements to be modified. To support this paradigm, we present
Chart$\text{M}^3$, a new benchmark for Multimodal chart editing with
Multi-level complexity and Multi-perspective evaluation. Chart$\text{M}^3$
contains 1,000 samples spanning four levels of editing difficulty. Each sample
includes triplets in the form of (chart, code, multimodal instructions). To
comprehensively evaluate chart editing models, Chart$\text{M}^3$ provides
metrics that assess both visual appearance and code correctness. Our benchmark
reveals significant limitations in current multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), including GPT-4o, particularly in their ability to interpret and act
on visual indicators. To address this, we construct Chart$\text{M}^3$-Train, a
large-scale training set with 24,000 multimodal chart editing samples.
Fine-tuning MLLMs on this dataset leads to substantial improvements,
demonstrating the importance of multimodal supervision in building practical
chart editing systems. Our datasets, codes, and evaluation tools are available

TL;DR: 本文开发了一种生成对抗网络（GAN），用于合成牙科全景X光片，旨在解决牙科研究和教育中数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决牙科研究和教育中数据稀缺的问题。

Method: 使用Wasserstein损失和梯度惩罚（WGANGP）训练深度卷积GAN（DCGAN），对2322张质量不一的X光片进行预处理和清理。

Result: 生成的X光片在解剖可见性和真实性方面表现中等，部分图像存在伪影。未去噪数据训练的模型在细节表现上更优，而去噪数据训练的模型在整体清晰度上更佳。

Conclusion: 为未来基于GAN的牙科影像方法研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a generative adversarial network (GAN)
for synthesizing dental panoramic radiographs. Although exploratory in nature,
the study aims to address the scarcity of data in dental research and
education. We trained a deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN) using a Wasserstein loss
with gradient penalty (WGANGP) on a dataset of 2322 radiographs of varying
quality. The focus was on the dentoalveolar regions, other anatomical
structures were cropped out. Extensive preprocessing and data cleaning were
performed to standardize the inputs while preserving anatomical variability. We
explored four candidate models by varying critic iterations, feature depth, and
the use of denoising prior to training. A clinical expert evaluated the
generated radiographs based on anatomical visibility and realism, using a
5-point scale (1 very poor 5 excellent). Most images showed moderate anatomical
depiction, although some were degraded by artifacts. A trade-off was observed
the model trained on non-denoised data yielded finer details especially in
structures like the mandibular canal and trabecular bone, while a model trained
on denoised data offered superior overall image clarity and sharpness. These
findings provide a foundation for future work on GAN-based methods in dental
imaging.

*Monika Shah,Somdeb Sarkhel,Deepak Venugopal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于混合马尔可夫逻辑网络（HMLNs）的解释框架，用于解释深度神经网络在多模态任务（如图像描述生成）中的信息整合过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度神经网络在多模态任务中表现优异，但其如何整合视觉、语言和知识表示以生成有意义的描述仍难以解释。现有性能度量方法通常依赖于与人工撰写描述的对比，无法深入揭示这种整合过程。

Method: 通过HMLNs（一种结合符号规则和实值函数的语言）学习训练实例的分布，并在生成样本条件下推断分布变化，从而量化哪些训练实例对生成描述提供了更丰富的信息。

Result: 实验表明，该框架能够为多种先进图像描述模型生成可解释的解释，并比较这些模型在可解释性方面的表现。

Conclusion: 提出的HMLN框架为深度神经网络的多模态任务提供了可解释的解释方法，有助于理解模型的信息整合过程。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have made tremendous progress in multimodal tasks
such as image captioning. However, explaining/interpreting how these models
integrate visual information, language information and knowledge representation
to generate meaningful captions remains a challenging problem. Standard metrics
to measure performance typically rely on comparing generated captions with
human-written ones that may not provide a user with a deep insights into this
integration. In this work, we develop a novel explanation framework that is
easily interpretable based on Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs) - a language
that can combine symbolic rules with real-valued functions - where we
hypothesize how relevant examples from the training data could have influenced
the generation of the observed caption. To do this, we learn a HMLN
distribution over the training instances and infer the shift in distributions
over these instances when we condition on the generated sample which allows us
to quantify which examples may have been a source of richer information to
generate the observed caption. Our experiments on captions generated for
several state-of-the-art captioning models using Amazon Mechanical Turk
illustrate the interpretability of our explanations, and allow us to compare
these models along the dimension of explainability.

Motivation: 半监督学习在图像分类中表现优异，但在时空动作定位中应用较少，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入双引导网络，结合帧级分类和边界框预测，确保动作类别在帧和边界框间的一致性。

Result: 在UCF101-24、J-HMDB-21和AVA数据集上表现优于基线方法，显著提升了有限标注数据下的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在时空动作定位任务中有效，尤其在标注数据有限的情况下表现突出。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) has shown tremendous potential to improve the
predictive performance of deep learning models when annotations are hard to
obtain. However, the application of SSL has so far been mainly studied in the
context of image classification. In this work, we present a semi-supervised
approach for spatial-temporal action localization. We introduce a dual guidance
network to select better pseudo-bounding boxes. It combines a frame-level
classification with a bounding-box prediction to enforce action class
consistency across frames and boxes. Our evaluation across well-known
spatial-temporal action localization datasets, namely UCF101-24 , J-HMDB-21 and
AVA shows that the proposed module considerably enhances the model's
performance in limited labeled data settings. Our framework achieves superior
results compared to extended image-based semi-supervised baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空野生动物追踪对保护工作至关重要，但面临技术挑战，如高成本、风险和计算资源限制。

Method: 采用数据增强方法（patching augmentation），比较三种不同架构的目标检测模型，分析超参数对检测精度的影响。

Result: 所有模型在至少一种配置下达到93%以上的mAP@IoU=0.5，且简单模型在计算资源有限时表现与复杂模型相当。

Conclusion: 研究支持在无人机部署中使用简单高效的模型，数据集和模型已开源。

Abstract: Aerial wildlife tracking is critical for conservation efforts and relies on
detecting small objects on the ground below the aircraft. It presents technical
challenges: crewed aircraft are expensive, risky and disruptive; autonomous
drones have limited computational capacity for onboard AI systems. Since the
objects of interest may appear only a few pixels wide, small object detection
is an inherently challenging computer vision subfield compounded by
computational efficiency needs. This paper applies a patching augmentation to
datasets to study model performance under various settings. A comparative study
of three common yet architecturally diverse object detectors is conducted using
the data, varying the patching method's hyperparameters against detection
accuracy. Each model achieved at least 93\% mAP@IoU=0.5 on at least one
patching configuration. Statistical analyses provide an in-depth commentary on
the effects of various factors. Analysis also shows that faster, simpler models
are about as effective as models that require more computational power for this
task and perform well given limited patch scales, encouraging UAV deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于潜在扩散模型（LDM）的新方法，用于从单视图图像估计HDR环境贴图，解决了ERP表示中的边界伪影问题，并提出了全景适应的扩散变换器架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ERP表示在环境贴图中常见的极点和边界伪影问题，提升单视图图像生成环境贴图的质量和准确性。

Method: 1. 使用潜在扩散模型（LDM）生成高质量环境贴图；2. 提出ERP卷积填充以消除边界伪影；3. 设计全景适应的扩散变换器架构（PanoDiT）以减少ERP失真。

Result: 模型在标准基准测试中表现优异，生成的环境贴图在图像质量和光照准确性上与现有最佳方法竞争。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了ERP表示中的伪影问题，但PanoDiT在减少失真的同时牺牲了部分图像质量和合理性。

Abstract: We advance the field of HDR environment map estimation from a single-view
image by establishing a novel approach leveraging the Latent Diffusion Model
(LDM) to produce high-quality environment maps that can plausibly light
mirror-reflective surfaces. A common issue when using the ERP representation,
the format used by the vast majority of approaches, is distortions at the poles
and a seam at the sides of the environment map. We remove the border seam
artefact by proposing an ERP convolutional padding in the latent autoencoder.
Additionally, we investigate whether adapting the diffusion network
architecture to the ERP format can improve the quality and accuracy of the
estimated environment map by proposing a panoramically-adapted Diffusion
Transformer architecture. Our proposed PanoDiT network reduces ERP distortions
and artefacts, but at the cost of image quality and plausibility. We evaluate
with standard benchmarks to demonstrate that our models estimate high-quality
environment maps that perform competitively with state-of-the-art approaches in
both image quality and lighting accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于CLIP的模型在医学任务中表现优异，但其公平性和鲁棒性尚未充分研究。

Method: 使用三个公开数据集（MIMIC-CXR、NIH-CXR14、NEATX）评估六种CLIP模型，分析其公平性和鲁棒性。

Result: 不同年龄患者间存在性能差距，其他属性表现较公平；模型在无胸引管的病例中表现较差。

Conclusion: CLIP模型在医学任务中需进一步优化公平性和鲁棒性，避免依赖虚假相关性。

Abstract: Motivated by the strong performance of CLIP-based models in natural
image-text domains, recent efforts have adapted these architectures to medical
tasks, particularly in radiology, where large paired datasets of images and
reports, such as chest X-rays, are available. While these models have shown
encouraging results in terms of accuracy and discriminative performance, their
fairness and robustness in the different clinical tasks remain largely
underexplored. In this study, we extensively evaluate six widely used
CLIP-based models on chest X-ray classification using three publicly available
datasets: MIMIC-CXR, NIH-CXR14, and NEATX. We assess the models fairness across
six conditions and patient subgroups based on age, sex, and race. Additionally,
we assess the robustness to shortcut learning by evaluating performance on
pneumothorax cases with and without chest drains. Our results indicate
performance gaps between patients of different ages, but more equitable results
for the other attributes. Moreover, all models exhibit lower performance on
images without chest drains, suggesting reliance on spurious correlations. We
further complement the performance analysis with a study of the embeddings
generated by the models. While the sensitive attributes could be classified
from the embeddings, we do not see such patterns using PCA, showing the
limitations of these visualisation techniques when assessing models. Our code

Motivation: 解决现有3D会议中人像表示的高硬件要求或固定外观限制问题，实现更自然和真实的远程交流。

Method: 通过独立处理每帧视频，结合稳定性损失函数，实时生成真实且稳定的3D高斯重建。

Result: 在视觉质量和稳定性上优于现有方法，并成功应用于仅需2D设备的3D会议。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D视频会议提供了一种高度可访问、真实且自然的解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual 3D meetings offer the potential to enhance copresence, increase
engagement and thus improve effectiveness of remote meetings compared to
standard 2D video calls. However, representing people in 3D meetings remains a
challenge; existing solutions achieve high quality by using complex hardware,
making use of fixed appearance via enrolment, or by inverting a pre-trained
generative model. These approaches lead to constraints that are unwelcome and
ill-fitting for videoconferencing applications. We present the first method to
predict 3D Gaussian reconstructions in real time from a single 2D webcam feed,
where the 3D representation is not only live and realistic, but also authentic
to the input video. By conditioning the 3D representation on each video frame
independently, our reconstruction faithfully recreates the input video from the
captured viewpoint (a property we call authenticity), while generalizing
realistically to novel viewpoints. Additionally, we introduce a stability loss
to obtain reconstructions that are temporally stable on video sequences. We
show that our method delivers state-of-the-art accuracy in visual quality and
stability metrics compared to existing methods, and demonstrate our approach in
live one-to-one 3D meetings using only a standard 2D camera and display. This
demonstrates that our approach can allow anyone to communicate volumetrically,
via a method for 3D videoconferencing that is not only highly accessible, but
also realistic and authentic.

Motivation: 管状结构（如血管网络）的准确分割在医学领域至关重要，但现有方法常忽视局部不连续区域，导致分割结果不理想。

Method: GLCP框架结合IMS模块（学习全局分割、骨架图和局部不连续图）和DAR模块（细化分割图），同时感知全局和局部结构特征。

Result: 在2D和3D数据集上的实验表明，GLCP在管状结构分割中优于现有方法，具有更高的准确性和连续性。

Conclusion: GLCP框架通过全局和局部特征的联合学习，有效解决了管状结构分割中的断裂问题，为医学图像分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tubular structures, such as vascular networks, plays
a critical role in various medical domains. A remaining significant challenge
in this task is structural fragmentation, which can adversely impact downstream
applications. Existing methods primarily focus on designing various loss
functions to constrain global topological structures. However, they often
overlook local discontinuity regions, leading to suboptimal segmentation
results. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Global-to-Local
Connectivity Preservation (GLCP) framework that can simultaneously perceive
global and local structural characteristics of tubular networks. Specifically,
we propose an Interactive Multi-head Segmentation (IMS) module to jointly learn
global segmentation, skeleton maps, and local discontinuity maps, respectively.
This enables our model to explicitly target local discontinuity regions while
maintaining global topological integrity. In addition, we design a lightweight
Dual-Attention-based Refinement (DAR) module to further improve segmentation
quality by refining the resulting segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on
both 2D and 3D datasets demonstrate that our GLCP achieves superior accuracy
and continuity in tubular structure segmentation compared to several
state-of-the-art approaches. The source codes will be available at

Result: VLMs的性能因修饰词而下降，表明该方法有助于理解模型局限性。

Conclusion: 修饰词对VLMs性能的影响揭示了其在处理复杂对话时的不足。

Abstract: We can think of Visual Question Answering as a (multimodal) conversation
between a human and an AI system. Here, we explore the sensitivity of Vision
Language Models (VLMs) through the lens of cooperative principles of
conversation proposed by Grice. Specifically, even when Grice's maxims of
conversation are flouted, humans typically do not have much difficulty in
understanding the conversation even though it requires more cognitive effort.
Here, we study if VLMs are capable of handling violations to Grice's maxims in
a manner that is similar to humans. Specifically, we add modifiers to
human-crafted questions and analyze the response of VLMs to these modifiers. We
use three state-of-the-art VLMs in our study, namely, GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet
and Gemini-1.5-Flash on questions from the VQA v2.0 dataset. Our initial
results seem to indicate that the performance of VLMs consistently diminish
with the addition of modifiers which indicates our approach as a promising
direction to understand the limitations of VLMs.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial medical imaging modality.
However, long acquisition times remain a significant challenge, leading to
increased costs, and reduced patient comfort. Recent studies have shown the
potential of using deep learning models that incorporate information from prior
subject-specific MRI scans to improve reconstruction quality of present scans.
Integrating this prior information requires registration of the previous scan
to the current image reconstruction, which can be time-consuming. We propose a
novel deep-learning-based MRI reconstruction framework which consists of an
initial reconstruction network, a deep registration model, and a
transformer-based enhancement network. We validated our method on a
longitudinal dataset of T1-weighted MRI scans with 2,808 images from 18
subjects at four acceleration factors (R5, R10, R15, R20). Quantitative metrics
confirmed our approach's superiority over existing methods (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon
signed-rank test). Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of our MRI
reconstruction method on the downstream task of brain segmentation and observed
improved accuracy and volumetric agreement with reference segmentations. Our
approach also achieved a substantial reduction in total reconstruction time
compared to methods that use traditional registration algorithms, making it
more suitable for real-time clinical applications. The code associated with
this work is publicly available at

Abstract: Adapting large Video-Language Models (VLMs) for action detection using only a
few examples poses challenges like overfitting and the granularity mismatch
between scene-level pre-training and required person-centric understanding. We
propose an efficient adaptation strategy combining parameter-efficient tuning
(LoRA) with a novel learnable internal feature augmentation. Applied within the
frozen VLM backbone using FiLM, these augmentations generate diverse feature
variations directly relevant to the task. Additionally, we introduce a
group-weighted loss function that dynamically modulates the training
contribution of each augmented sample based on its prediction divergence
relative to the group average. This promotes robust learning by prioritizing
informative yet reasonable augmentations. We demonstrate our method's
effectiveness on complex multi-label, multi-person action detection datasets
(AVA, MOMA), achieving strong mAP performance and showcasing significant data
efficiency for adapting VLMs from limited examples.

Motivation: 现有BEV 3D目标检测方法忽略环境上下文信息（如道路和人行道），导致对物理世界的感知不全面。

Method: 提出多任务学习框架CoP，结合空间占用预测任务；生成密集占用真值（LDO），使用体素高度引导采样（VHS）策略，开发全局-局部特征融合模块（CFF）。

Conclusion: CoP通过多任务协作和特征融合，显著提升了BEV 3D目标检测的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-based bird's-eye-view (BEV) 3D object detection has advanced
significantly in autonomous driving by offering cost-effectiveness and rich
contextual information. However, existing methods often construct BEV
representations by collapsing extracted object features, neglecting intrinsic
environmental contexts, such as roads and pavements. This hinders detectors
from comprehensively perceiving the characteristics of the physical world. To
alleviate this, we introduce a multi-task learning framework, Collaborative
Perceiver (CoP), that leverages spatial occupancy as auxiliary information to
mine consistent structural and conceptual similarities shared between 3D object
detection and occupancy prediction tasks, bridging gaps in spatial
representations and feature refinement. To this end, we first propose a
pipeline to generate dense occupancy ground truths incorporating local density
information (LDO) for reconstructing detailed environmental information. Next,
we employ a voxel-height-guided sampling (VHS) strategy to distill fine-grained
local features according to distinct object properties. Furthermore, we develop
a global-local collaborative feature fusion (CFF) module that seamlessly
integrates complementary knowledge between both tasks, thus composing more
robust BEV representations. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark
demonstrate that CoP outperforms existing vision-based frameworks, achieving
49.5\% mAP and 59.2\% NDS on the test set. Code and supplementary materials are

Abstract: Wildlife populations in Africa face severe threats, with vertebrate numbers
declining by over 65% in the past five decades. In response, image
classification using deep learning has emerged as a promising tool for
biodiversity monitoring and conservation. This paper presents a comparative
study of deep learning models for automatically classifying African wildlife
images, focusing on transfer learning with frozen feature extractors. Using a
public dataset of four species: buffalo, elephant, rhinoceros, and zebra; we
evaluate the performance of DenseNet-201, ResNet-152, EfficientNet-B4, and
Vision Transformer ViT-H/14. DenseNet-201 achieved the best performance among
convolutional networks (67% accuracy), while ViT-H/14 achieved the highest
overall accuracy (99%), but with significantly higher computational cost,
raising deployment concerns. Our experiments highlight the trade-offs between
accuracy, resource requirements, and deployability. The best-performing CNN
(DenseNet-201) was integrated into a Hugging Face Gradio Space for real-time
field use, demonstrating the feasibility of deploying lightweight models in
conservation settings. This work contributes to African-grounded AI research by
offering practical insights into model selection, dataset preparation, and
responsible deployment of deep learning tools for wildlife conservation.

TL;DR: PDAF通过概率扩散建模提升语义分割网络的泛化能力，利用潜在域先验（LDP）对齐源域和目标域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决领域泛化语义分割中因领域偏移导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 提出PDAF框架，包含LPE、DCM和DPE三个模块，通过扩散过程建模LDP并调整特征表示。

Result: 在多样化城市场景中验证了PDAF的有效性。

Conclusion: PDAF能够显著提升模型在复杂目标条件下的泛化能力。

Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) is a critical yet challenging
task, as domain shifts in unseen environments can severely compromise model
performance. While recent studies enhance feature alignment by projecting
features into the source domain, they often neglect intrinsic latent domain
priors, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce PDAF, a
Probabilistic Diffusion Alignment Framework that enhances the generalization of
existing segmentation networks through probabilistic diffusion modeling. PDAF
introduces a Latent Domain Prior (LDP) to capture domain shifts and uses this
prior as a conditioning factor to align both source and unseen target domains.
To achieve this, PDAF integrates into a pre-trained segmentation model and
utilizes paired source and pseudo-target images to simulate latent domain
shifts, enabling LDP modeling. The framework comprises three modules: the
Latent Prior Extractor (LPE) predicts the LDP by supervising domain shifts; the
Domain Compensation Module (DCM) adjusts feature representations to mitigate
domain shifts; and the Diffusion Prior Estimator (DPE) leverages a diffusion
process to estimate the LDP without requiring paired samples. This design
enables PDAF to iteratively model domain shifts, progressively refining feature
representations to enhance generalization under complex target conditions.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PDAF across diverse and
challenging urban scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从2D俯视图生成360度室内全景图在虚拟现实、室内设计等领域有广泛应用，但缺乏显式3D结构和几何一致性是主要挑战。

Method: Top2Pano首先估计体积占用以推断3D结构，然后通过体积渲染生成粗略的颜色和深度全景图，最后使用ControlNet进行扩散细化。

Result: 在两个数据集上的评估显示，Top2Pano优于基线方法，能有效重建几何、遮挡和空间布局，并能从示意性平面图生成高质量全景图。

Conclusion: Top2Pano在连接俯视图与沉浸式室内合成方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Generating immersive 360{\deg} indoor panoramas from 2D top-down views has
applications in virtual reality, interior design, real estate, and robotics.
This task is challenging due to the lack of explicit 3D structure and the need
for geometric consistency and photorealism. We propose Top2Pano, an end-to-end
model for synthesizing realistic indoor panoramas from top-down views. Our
method estimates volumetric occupancy to infer 3D structures, then uses
volumetric rendering to generate coarse color and depth panoramas. These guide
a diffusion-based refinement stage using ControlNet, enhancing realism and
structural fidelity. Evaluations on two datasets show Top2Pano outperforms
baselines, effectively reconstructing geometry, occlusions, and spatial
arrangements. It also generalizes well, producing high-quality panoramas from
schematic floorplans. Our results highlight Top2Pano's potential in bridging
top-down views with immersive indoor synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLaVA-Reward是一种高效的奖励模型，利用预训练的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）自动评估文本到图像（T2I）生成的多个方面。通过Skip-connection Cross Attention模块增强视觉与文本的双向交互，并支持多种偏好数据微调。实验表明其在自动评估和推理扩展方面优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM方法需要指令跟随数据进行监督微调，且评估生成质量时依赖文本响应分析，耗时且难以训练。LLaVA-Reward旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 直接利用MLLMs的隐藏状态处理文本-图像对，引入SkipCA模块增强视觉与文本的交互，支持配对和非配对偏好数据微调。

Result: 在文本-图像对齐、保真度/伪影、安全性和整体排名四个评估视角上，LLaVA-Reward优于传统和MLLM方法。

Conclusion: LLaVA-Reward在自动评估和推理扩展方面表现出色，为T2I生成提供了高效的多视角评估工具。

Abstract: We introduce LLaVA-Reward, an efficient reward model designed to
automatically evaluate text-to-image (T2I) generations across multiple
perspectives, leveraging pretrained multimodal large language models (MLLMs).
Existing MLLM-based approaches require instruction-following data for
supervised fine-tuning and evaluate generation quality on analyzing text
response, which is time-consuming and difficult to train. To address this
problem, we propose LLaVA-Reward, which directly utilizes the hidden states of
MLLMs given text-image pairs. To enhance the bidirectional interaction between
visual and textual representations in decoder-only MLLMs, we further propose
adding a Skip-connection Cross Attention (SkipCA) module. This design enhances
text-image correlation reasoning by connecting early-layer visual features with
later-layer hidden representations.In addition, LLaVA-Reward supports different
types of preference data for efficient fine-tuning, including paired preference
data and unpaired data. We train LLaVA-Reward on four evaluation perspectives:
text-image alignment, fidelity/artifact, safety, and overall ranking. Empirical
results demonstrate that LLaVA-Reward outperforms conventional and MLLM-based
methods in generating human-aligned scores for automatic evaluations and
inference-time scaling in text-to-image generations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要针对推理，训练效率提升有限，ReGATE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用教师-学生框架，结合参考损失和EMA难度评分，选择性处理关键令牌。

Result: 在VideoLLaMA2上，ReGATE达到标准训练峰值精度，速度提升2倍，令牌使用减少35%。

Conclusion: ReGATE不仅高效，还能在减少令牌数量的情况下超越基线性能。

Abstract: The computational cost of training multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
rapidly increases with the number of tokens involved. Existing efficiency
methods primarily target inference and rely on token reduction or merging,
offering limited benefit during training. In this paper, we propose ReGATE
(Reference$-$Guided Adaptive Token Elision), an adaptive token pruning method
for accelerating MLLM training. Specifically, ReGATE adopts a teacher-student
framework in which the MLLM being trained serves as the student, and a frozen
reference large language model (LLM) acts as the teacher. The teacher computes
per-token reference losses, which are combined with an exponential moving
average (EMA) of the student's own difficulty scores. This adaptive
difficulty-based scoring enables the selective processing of crucial tokens
while bypassing less informative ones in the forward pass, significantly
reducing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ReGATE, when
applied to VideoLLaMA2, matches the peak accuracy of standard training on
MVBench up to 2$\times$ faster, using only 35% of the tokens. With additional
training, it even surpasses the baseline on several multimodal benchmarks, all
while reducing the total token count by over 41%. Code and models will be
released soon.

TL;DR: MapDiffusion提出了一种基于扩散模型的生成方法，用于学习向量化地图的完整分布，从而捕捉环境的不确定性和模糊性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统地图构建模型只能提供确定性点估计，无法处理真实环境中的模糊性和不确定性（如遮挡和缺失车道标记）。

Method: MapDiffusion利用扩散模型，通过迭代优化随机初始化的查询，生成多个可能的地图样本，并基于BEV潜在网格进行条件化。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，MapDiffusion在在线地图构建中实现了最先进的性能，单样本性能提升5%，且多样本聚合进一步提高了ROC曲线性能。

Conclusion: MapDiffusion通过建模完整的地图分布，增强了在线向量化高清地图构建的鲁棒性和可靠性，支持自动驾驶在复杂环境中的不确定性感知决策。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires an understanding of the static environment from
sensor data. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to fuse
multiple inputs, and a vector decoder predicts a vectorized map representation
from the latent BEV grid. However, traditional map construction models provide
deterministic point estimates, failing to capture uncertainty and the inherent
ambiguities of real-world environments, such as occlusions and missing lane
markings. We propose MapDiffusion, a novel generative approach that leverages
the diffusion paradigm to learn the full distribution of possible vectorized
maps. Instead of predicting a single deterministic output from learned queries,
MapDiffusion iteratively refines randomly initialized queries, conditioned on a
BEV latent grid, to generate multiple plausible map samples. This allows
aggregating samples to improve prediction accuracy and deriving uncertainty
estimates that directly correlate with scene ambiguity. Extensive experiments
on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art
performance in online map construction, surpassing the baseline by 5% in
single-sample performance. We further show that aggregating multiple samples
consistently improves performance along the ROC curve, validating the benefit
of distribution modeling. Additionally, our uncertainty estimates are
significantly higher in occluded areas, reinforcing their value in identifying
regions with ambiguous sensor input. By modeling the full map distribution,
MapDiffusion enhances the robustness and reliability of online vectorized HD
map construction, enabling uncertainty-aware decision-making for autonomous
vehicles in complex environments.

Motivation: 现有半监督学习方法在医学图像分割中主要依赖像素级一致性训练，忽略了更全面的语义一致性，且存在标记与未标记数据特征差异问题。

Method: DuCiSC提出双重范式，通过原型对齐实现标记与未标记图像、标记与融合图像的区域级语义一致性，并设计自感知置信度估计策略选择可靠伪标签。

Result: 在四个数据集（包括左心房、胰腺分割等）上验证，DuCiSC表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DuCiSC通过跨图像语义一致性和自感知伪标签选择，显著提升了半监督医学图像分割性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has proven highly effective in tackling the
challenge of limited labeled training data in medical image segmentation. In
general, current approaches, which rely on intra-image pixel-wise consistency
training via pseudo-labeling, overlook the consistency at more comprehensive
semantic levels (e.g., object region) and suffer from severe discrepancy of
extracted features resulting from an imbalanced number of labeled and unlabeled
data. To overcome these limitations, we present a new \underline{Du}al
\underline{C}ross-\underline{i}mage \underline{S}emantic
\underline{C}onsistency (DuCiSC) learning framework, for semi-supervised
medical image segmentation. Concretely, beyond enforcing pixel-wise semantic
consistency, DuCiSC proposes dual paradigms to encourage region-level semantic
consistency across: 1) labeled and unlabeled images; and 2) labeled and fused
images, by explicitly aligning their prototypes. Relying on the dual paradigms,
DuCiSC can effectively establish consistent cross-image semantics via prototype
representations, thereby addressing the feature discrepancy issue. Moreover, we
devise a novel self-aware confidence estimation strategy to accurately select
reliable pseudo labels, allowing for exploiting the training dynamics of
unlabeled data. Our DuCiSC method is extensively validated on four datasets,
including two popular binary benchmarks in segmenting the left atrium and
pancreas, a multi-class Automatic Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge dataset, and a
challenging scenario of segmenting the inferior alveolar nerve that features
complicated anatomical structures, showing superior segmentation results over
previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于递归视觉想象（RVI）和自适应语言对齐（ALG）的导航策略，解决了视觉语言导航（VLN）中场景表示过细和视觉语言对齐模糊的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLN代理因场景表示过细和视觉语言对齐模糊，导致对导航友好的高层场景先验理解不足，容易违反语言命令。

Method: 通过递归总结视觉感知并建模历史轨迹为紧凑神经网格，提出RVI技术；通过ALG技术对齐情境记忆与语言组件。

Result: 在VLN-CE和ObjectNav任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RVI和ALG技术显著提升了VLN的性能。

Abstract: Vision Language Navigation (VLN) typically requires agents to navigate to
specified objects or remote regions in unknown scenes by obeying linguistic
commands. Such tasks require organizing historical visual observations for
linguistic grounding, which is critical for long-sequence navigational
decisions. However, current agents suffer from overly detailed scene
representation and ambiguous vision-language alignment, which weaken their
comprehension of navigation-friendly high-level scene priors and easily lead to
behaviors that violate linguistic commands. To tackle these issues, we propose
a navigation policy by recursively summarizing along-the-way visual
perceptions, which are adaptively aligned with commands to enhance linguistic
grounding. In particular, by structurally modeling historical trajectories as
compact neural grids, several Recursive Visual Imagination (RVI) techniques are
proposed to motivate agents to focus on the regularity of visual transitions
and semantic scene layouts, instead of dealing with misleading geometric
details. Then, an Adaptive Linguistic Grounding (ALG) technique is proposed to
align the learned situational memories with different linguistic components
purposefully. Such fine-grained semantic matching facilitates the accurate
anticipation of navigation actions and progress. Our navigation policy
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the challenging VLN-CE and
ObjectNav tasks, showing the superiority of our RVI and ALG techniques for VLN.

Conclusion: 自监督数据集蒸馏方法有效压缩数据并提升泛化能力，新技术显著优化了蒸馏效果。

Abstract: Although larger datasets are crucial for training large deep models, the
rapid growth of dataset size has brought a significant challenge in terms of
considerable training costs, which even results in prohibitive computational
expenses. Dataset Distillation becomes a popular technique recently to reduce
the dataset size via learning a highly compact set of representative exemplars,
where the model trained with these exemplars ideally should have comparable
performance with respect to the one trained with the full dataset. While most
of existing works upon dataset distillation focus on supervised datasets, we
instead aim to distill images and their self-supervisedly trained
representations into a distilled set. This procedure, named as Self-Supervised
Dataset Distillation, effectively extracts rich information from real datasets,
yielding the distilled sets with enhanced cross-architecture generalizability.
Particularly, in order to preserve the key characteristics of original dataset
more faithfully and compactly, several novel techniques are proposed: 1) we
introduce an innovative parameterization upon images and representations via
distinct low-dimensional bases, where the base selection for parameterization
is experimentally shown to play a crucial role; 2) we tackle the instability
induced by the randomness of data augmentation -- a key component in
self-supervised learning but being underestimated in the prior work of
self-supervised dataset distillation -- by utilizing predetermined
augmentations; 3) we further leverage a lightweight network to model the
connections among the representations of augmented views from the same image,
leading to more compact pairs of distillation. Extensive experiments conducted
on various datasets validate the superiority of our approach in terms of
distillation efficiency, cross-architecture generalization, and transfer
learning performance.

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了低光场景下的光场目标跟踪性能，展示了高质量角-时域建模的潜力。

Abstract: High-quality 4D light field representation with efficient angular feature
modeling is crucial for scene perception, as it can provide discriminative
spatial-angular cues to identify moving targets. However, recent developments
still struggle to deliver reliable angular modeling in the temporal domain,
particularly in complex low-light scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel
light field epipolar-plane structure image (ESI) representation that explicitly
defines the geometric structure within the light field. By capitalizing on the
abrupt changes in the angles of light rays within the epipolar plane, this
representation can enhance visual expression in low-light scenes and reduce
redundancy in high-dimensional light fields. We further propose an
angular-temporal interaction network (ATINet) for light field object tracking
that learns angular-aware representations from the geometric structural cues
and angular-temporal interaction cues of light fields. Furthermore, ATINet can
also be optimized in a self-supervised manner to enhance the geometric feature
interaction across the temporal domain. Finally, we introduce a large-scale
light field low-light dataset for object tracking. Extensive experimentation
demonstrates that ATINet achieves state-of-the-art performance in single object
tracking. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to multiple object
tracking, which also shows the effectiveness of high-quality light field
angular-temporal modeling.

Motivation: 现有方法在开放集3D物体检索中因训练数据不足而难以生成泛化表示，而CLIP在图像-文本对上的预训练提供了广泛的下游任务泛化能力。

Method: DAC框架结合CLIP和MLLM，利用MLLM描述已知类别信息以适配CLIP，并在推理时提供未知物体的外部提示。引入AB-LoRA以减少过拟合并增强泛化能力。

Conclusion: DAC通过简单有效的框架显著提升了开放集3D物体检索的性能，展示了其在多模态任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Open-set 3D object retrieval (3DOR) is an emerging task aiming to retrieve 3D
objects of unseen categories beyond the training set. Existing methods
typically utilize all modalities (i.e., voxels, point clouds, multi-view
images) and train specific backbones before fusion. However, they still
struggle to produce generalized representations due to insufficient 3D training
data. Being contrastively pre-trained on web-scale image-text pairs, CLIP
inherently produces generalized representations for a wide range of downstream
tasks. Building upon it, we present a simple yet effective framework named
Describe, Adapt and Combine (DAC) by taking only multi-view images for open-set
3DOR. DAC innovatively synergizes a CLIP model with a multi-modal large
language model (MLLM) to learn generalized 3D representations, where the MLLM
is used for dual purposes. First, it describes the seen category information to
align with CLIP's training objective for adaptation during training. Second, it
provides external hints about unknown objects complementary to visual cues
during inference. To improve the synergy, we introduce an Additive-Bias
Low-Rank adaptation (AB-LoRA), which alleviates overfitting and further
enhances the generalization to unseen categories. With only multi-view images,
DAC significantly surpasses prior arts by an average of +10.01\% mAP on four
open-set 3DOR datasets. Moreover, its generalization is also validated on
image-based and cross-dataset setups. Code is available at

Conclusion: VAGU和GtS为视频异常检测提供了更全面的解决方案，JeAUG指标弥补了传统评估的不足。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events in videos and
accurately determine their time intervals. Current VAD methods mainly fall into
two categories: traditional DNN-based approaches that focus on temporal
localization, and LLM-based approaches that emphasize semantic understanding.
Both anomaly understanding and grounding are essential for comprehensive video
anomaly detection and can complement each other. However, no existing model or
dataset supports both tasks simultaneously. To address this, we introduce VAGU
(Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding), the first benchmark to integrate
both tasks. Each VAGU instance includes annotations for anomaly category,
semantic explanation, precise temporal grounding and Video QA. We also provide
multiple-choice Video QA for objective evaluation. Based on this dataset, we
propose Glance then Scrutinize (GtS), a training-free framework guided by
textual prompts. The framework first enables coarse localization of
high-probability anomalous regions, followed by detailed anomaly interpretation
and temporal boundary refinement. Additionally, we propose the JeAUG metric,
which jointly evaluates semantic interpretability and temporal precision,
overcoming the limitations of traditional metrics. Extensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our benchmark, framework, and evaluation metric.

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) has emerged as a powerful approach for minimizing
labeling costs by selectively sampling the most informative data for neural
network model development. Effective AL for large-scale vision-language models
necessitates addressing challenges in uncertainty estimation and efficient
sampling given the vast number of parameters involved. In this work, we
introduce a novel parameter-efficient learning methodology that incorporates
uncertainty calibration loss within the AL framework. We propose a
differentiable loss function that promotes uncertainty calibration for
effectively selecting fewer and most informative data samples for fine-tuning.
Through extensive experiments across several datasets and vision backbones, we
demonstrate that our solution can match and exceed the performance of complex
feature-based sampling techniques while being computationally very efficient.
Additionally, we investigate the efficacy of Prompt learning versus Low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) in sample selection, providing a detailed comparative
analysis of these methods in the context of efficient AL.

Conclusion: Chain-of-Cooking模型有效解决了烹饪过程可视化中的关键挑战，并展示了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Cooking process visualization is a promising task in the intersection of
image generation and food analysis, which aims to generate an image for each
cooking step of a recipe. However, most existing works focus on generating
images of finished foods based on the given recipes, and face two challenges to
visualize the cooking process. First, the appearance of ingredients changes
variously across cooking steps, it is difficult to generate the correct
appearances of foods that match the textual description, leading to semantic
inconsistency. Second, the current step might depend on the operations of
previous step, it is crucial to maintain the contextual coherence of images in
sequential order. In this work, we present a cooking process visualization
model, called Chain-of-Cooking. Specifically, to generate correct appearances
of ingredients, we present a Dynamic Patch Selection Module to retrieve
previously generated image patches as references, which are most related to
current textual contents. Furthermore, to enhance the coherence and keep the
rational order of generated images, we propose a Semantic Evolution Module and
a Bidirectional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Guidance. To better utilize the
semantics of previous texts, the Semantic Evolution Module establishes the
semantical association between latent prompts and current cooking step, and
merges it with the latent features. Then the CoT Guidance updates the merged
features to guide the current cooking step remain coherent with the previous
step. Moreover, we construct a dataset named CookViz, consisting of
intermediate image-text pairs for the cooking process. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods in
generating coherent and semantic consistent cooking process.

Abstract: Robust deepfake detection models must be capable of generalizing to
ever-evolving manipulation techniques beyond training data. A promising
strategy is to augment the training data with online synthesized fake images
containing broadly generalizable artifacts. However, in the context of deepfake
detection, it is surprising that jointly training on both original and online
synthesized forgeries may result in degraded performance. This contradicts the
common belief that incorporating more source-domain data should enhance
detection accuracy. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to
gradient conflicts during backpropagation which force a trade-off between
source domain accuracy and target domain generalization. To overcome this
issue, we propose a Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework
that explicitly mitigates the gradient conflict via two synergistic modules.
First, an Update Vector Search (UVS) module searches for an alternative update
vector near the initial gradient vector to reconcile the disparities of the
original and online synthesized forgeries. By further transforming the search
process into an extremum optimization problem, UVS yields the uniquely update
vector, which maximizes the simultaneous loss reductions for each data type.
Second, a Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR) module enforces a low-conflict
feature embedding space through a novel Conflict Descent Loss. This loss
penalizes misaligned gradient directions and guides the learning of
representations with aligned, non-conflicting gradients. The synergy of UVS and
CGR alleviates gradient interference in both parameter optimization and
representation learning. Experiments on multiple deepfake benchmarks
demonstrate that CS-DFD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain
detection accuracy and cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: 该综述为太阳传感器建模与校准技术提供了系统性参考。

Abstract: Attitude sensors determine the spacecraft attitude through the sensing of an
astronomical object, field or other phenomena. The Sun and fixed stars are the
two primary astronomical sensing objects. Attitude sensors are critical
components for the survival and knowledge improvement of spacecraft. Of these,
sun sensors are the most common and important sensor for spacecraft attitude
determination. The sun sensor measures the Sun vector in spacecraft
coordinates. The sun sensor calibration process is particularly difficult due
to the complex nature of the uncertainties involved. The uncertainties are
small, difficult to observe, and vary spatio-temporally over the lifecycle of
the sensor. In addition, the sensors are affected by numerous sources of
uncertainties, including manufacturing, electrical, environmental, and
interference sources. This motivates the development of advanced calibration
algorithms to minimize uncertainty over the sensor lifecycle and improve
accuracy. Although modeling and calibration techniques for sun sensors have
been explored extensively in the literature over the past two decades, there is
currently no resource that consolidates and systematically reviews this body of
work. The present review proposes a systematic mapping of sun sensor modeling
and calibration algorithms across a breadth of sensor configurations. It
specifically provides a comprehensive survey of each methodology, along with an
analysis of research gaps and recommendations for future directions in sun
sensor modeling and calibration techniques.

MVR, achieving 89.6\% object-wise AU-ROC and 95.7\% point-wise AU-ROC on the

TL;DR: 论文提出RelMap框架，通过结合空间关系和语义先验提升在线高清地图构建的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的方法忽视了地图元素间的空间和语义关系，限制了性能。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse 2数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: RelMap通过显式建模空间和语义关系，显著提升了在线地图构建的效果。

Abstract: Online high-definition (HD) map construction plays an increasingly important
role in scaling autonomous driving systems. Transformer-based methods have
become prevalent in online HD map construction; however, existing approaches
often neglect the inherent spatial and semantic relationships among map
elements, which limits their accuracy and generalization. To address this, we
propose RelMap, an end-to-end framework that enhances online map construction
by incorporating spatial relations and semantic priors. We introduce a
Class-aware Spatial Relation Prior, which explicitly encodes relative
positional dependencies between map elements using a learnable class-aware
relation encoder. Additionally, we propose a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
Semantic Prior, which routes features to class-specific experts based on
predicted class probabilities, refining instance feature decoding. Our method
is compatible with both single-frame and temporal perception backbones,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2
datasets.

TL;DR: LinDeps是一种基于线性依赖分析的后剪枝方法，能有效识别并移除冗余滤波器，提升CNN的压缩率且不降低性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN在资源受限平台上的高效部署面临挑战，现有剪枝技术忽视特征图间的结构依赖，导致剪枝决策不理想。

Method: LinDeps通过主元QR分解检测线性依赖滤波器并剪枝，结合信号恢复机制调整下一层核以保持性能。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet上的实验显示，LinDeps提升了现有剪枝技术的压缩率并保持性能，在低资源环境下表现优异。

Conclusion: LinDeps是当前和未来剪枝技术的重要补充，显著提升了CNN的剪枝效果和推理速度。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are widely used in many computer vision
tasks. Yet, their increasing size and complexity pose significant challenges
for efficient deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Hence, network
pruning has emerged as an effective way of reducing the size and computational
requirements of neural networks by removing redundant or unimportant
parameters. However, a fundamental challenge with pruning consists in optimally
removing redundancies without degrading performance. Most existing pruning
techniques overlook structural dependencies across feature maps within a layer,
resulting in suboptimal pruning decisions. In this work, we introduce LinDeps,
a novel post-pruning method, i.e., a pruning method that can be applied on top
of any pruning technique, which systematically identifies and removes redundant
filters via linear dependency analysis. Particularly, LinDeps applies pivoted
QR decomposition to feature maps to detect and prune linearly dependent
filters. Then, a novel signal recovery mechanism adjusts the next layer's
kernels to preserve compatibility and performance without requiring any
fine-tuning. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with VGG and ResNet
backbones demonstrate that LinDeps improves compression rates of existing
pruning techniques while preserving performances, leading to a new state of the
art in CNN pruning. We also benchmark LinDeps in low-resource setups where no
retraining can be performed, which shows significant pruning improvements and
inference speedups over a state-of-the-art method. LinDeps therefore
constitutes an essential add-on for any current or future pruning technique.

### [93] [TARS: MinMax Token-Adaptive Preference Strategy for Hallucination Reduction in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21584)
*Kejia Zhang,Keda Tao,Zhiming Luo,Chang Liu,Jiasheng Tang,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TARS是一种基于token自适应的偏好策略，通过最小化偏好损失和最大化分布偏移，减少多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题，性能优于标准DPO。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）常生成看似合理但事实错误或视觉不相关的输出，影响可靠性。现有DPO方法依赖静态监督信号，容易过拟合语言线索，导致视觉信息关联性不足。

Method: 提出TARS，将DPO重新定义为最小-最大优化问题，最大化语义约束下的token级分布偏移以模拟对齐不确定性，同时最小化偏好损失。

Result: 在多个幻觉基准测试中，TARS仅用4.8k偏好样本和无专家反馈，将幻觉率从26.4%降至13.2%，认知值从2.5降至0.4，性能匹配GPT-4o。

Conclusion: TARS通过动态优化策略有效减少多模态推理中的幻觉问题，优于传统DPO方法。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable vision-language reasoning,
yet often generate plausible outputs that are factually incorrect or visually
ungrounded, thereby compromising their reliability. Direct preference
optimization (DPO) is a common strategy for correcting hallucinations by
aligning model outputs with human preferences. Existing DPO strategies
typically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on
static supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to
superficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional
rigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant
visual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a
token-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max
optimization problem. TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts under
semantic constraints to simulate alignment uncertainty, and simultaneously
minimizes the expected preference loss under these controlled perturbations.
This joint objective preserves causal grounding while mitigating overfitting to
preference patterns, thereby reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning.
We evaluate TARS on multiple hallucination benchmarks and find consistently
strong performance. Using only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback,
TARS reduces hallucination rates from 26.4% to 13.2% and decreases cognition
value from 2.5 to 0.4. It outperforms standard DPO and matches GPT-4o on
several key metrics.

Result: 总结了最新技术和进展，分析了现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究的几个有前景方向，旨在帮助熟悉WSSS基础的研究者深入了解当前进展。

Abstract: Unlike fully supervised semantic segmentation, weakly supervised semantic
segmentation (WSSS) relies on weaker forms of supervision to perform dense
prediction tasks. Among the various types of weak supervision, WSSS with image
level annotations is considered both the most challenging and the most
practical, attracting significant research attention. Therefore, in this
review, we focus on WSSS with image level annotations. Additionally, this
review concentrates on mainstream research directions, deliberately omitting
less influential branches.
  Given the rapid development of new methods and the limitations of existing
surveys in capturing recent trends, there is a pressing need for an updated and
comprehensive review. Our goal is to fill this gap by synthesizing the latest
advancements and state-of-the-art techniques in WSSS with image level labels.
  Basically, we provide a comprehensive review of recent advancements in WSSS
with image level labels, categorizing existing methods based on the types and
levels of additional supervision involved. We also examine the challenges of
applying advanced methods to domain specific datasets in WSSS,a topic that
remains underexplored. Finally, we discuss the current challenges, evaluate the
limitations of existing approaches, and outline several promising directions
for future research. This review is intended for researchers who are already
familiar with the fundamental concepts of WSSS and are seeking to deepen their
understanding of current advances and methodological innovations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于局部区域选择性老化的新方法，解决了现有技术将老化视为全局同质过程的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如GAN和扩散模型）通常基于参考图像和目标年龄生成老化效果，但忽略了面部区域因内在和外在因素而老化不均的问题。

Method: 利用潜在扩散模型选择性老化特定面部区域，并通过潜在扩散细化器无缝融合局部老化区域，实现全局一致的自然合成。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在身份保持、高保真图像和自然可控的老化进程三个方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法通过局部选择性老化实现了更真实和个性化的面部老化效果。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to face aging that addresses the limitations of
current methods which treat aging as a global, homogeneous process. Existing
techniques using GANs and diffusion models often condition generation on a
reference image and target age, neglecting that facial regions age
heterogeneously due to both intrinsic chronological factors and extrinsic
elements like sun exposure. Our method leverages latent diffusion models to
selectively age specific facial regions using local aging signs. This approach
provides significantly finer-grained control over the generation process,
enabling more realistic and personalized aging. We employ a latent diffusion
refiner to seamlessly blend these locally aged regions, ensuring a globally
consistent and natural-looking synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method effectively achieves three key criteria for successful face aging:
robust identity preservation, high-fidelity and realistic imagery, and a
natural, controllable aging progression.

Method: 采用解耦的时空一致性训练框架，结合全局空间定位和局部时间关联，设计实例对比损失。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上性能显著优于现有自监督方法，AUC提升最高达25.3%。

Conclusion: SSTrack展示了自监督学习在视觉跟踪中的潜力，显著减少了对标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: The success of visual tracking has been largely driven by datasets with
manual box annotations. However, these box annotations require tremendous human
effort, limiting the scale and diversity of existing tracking datasets. In this
work, we present a novel Self-Supervised Tracking framework named
\textbf{{\tracker}}, designed to eliminate the need of box annotations.
Specifically, a decoupled spatio-temporal consistency training framework is
proposed to learn rich target information across timestamps through global
spatial localization and local temporal association. This allows for the
simulation of appearance and motion variations of instances in real-world
scenarios. Furthermore, an instance contrastive loss is designed to learn
instance-level correspondences from a multi-view perspective, offering robust
instance supervision without additional labels. This new design paradigm
enables {\tracker} to effectively learn generic tracking representations in a
self-supervised manner, while reducing reliance on extensive box annotations.
Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that {\tracker}
surpasses \textit{SOTA} self-supervised tracking methods, achieving an
improvement of more than 25.3\%, 20.4\%, and 14.8\% in AUC (AO) score on the
GOT10K, LaSOT, TrackingNet datasets, respectively. Code:

Motivation: 探讨在医学图像分割中，复杂模型是否总是优于简单模型，尤其是在低对比度边界等挑战性条件下。

Method: 使用DeepLabv3模型进行iPS细胞集落分割，并与SAM2和MedSAM2等大型基础模型对比。

Result: DeepLabv3在实验条件下表现更优，表明模型复杂性不总是带来性能提升。

Conclusion: 在特定生物医学任务中，简单且适应性强的模型可能更实用，研究提供了开源实现以支持相关领域发展。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires not only accuracy but also robustness
under challenging imaging conditions. In this study, we show that a carefully
configured DeepLabv3 model can achieve high performance in segmenting induced
pluripotent stem (iPS) cell colonies, and, under our experimental conditions,
outperforms large-scale foundation models such as SAM2 and its medical variant
MedSAM2 without structural modifications. These results suggest that, for
specialized tasks characterized by subtle, low-contrast boundaries, increased
model complexity does not necessarily translate to better performance. Our work
revisits the assumption that ever-larger and more generalized architectures are
always preferable, and provides evidence that appropriately adapted, simpler
models may offer strong accuracy and practical reliability in domain-specific
biomedical applications. We also offer an open-source implementation that
includes strategies for small datasets and domain-specific encoding, with the
aim of supporting further advances in semantic segmentation for regenerative
medicine and related fields.

Result: 在合成和真实图像上均表现良好，真实图像的Pose mAP50-95达到0.97。

Conclusion: 合成数据方法有效提升了模型性能，适用于复杂场景的风力涡轮机检测。

Abstract: For the autonomous drone-based inspection of wind turbine (WT) blades,
accurate detection of the WT and its key features is essential for safe drone
positioning and collision avoidance. Existing deep learning methods typically
rely on manually labeled real-world images, which limits both the quantity and
the diversity of training datasets in terms of weather conditions, lighting,
turbine types, and image complexity. In this paper, we propose a method to
generate synthetic training data that allows controlled variation of visual and
environmental factors, increasing the diversity and hence creating challenging
learning scenarios. Furthermore, we train a YOLOv11 feature detection network
solely on synthetic WT images with a modified loss function, to detect WTs and
their key features within an image. The resulting network is evaluated both
using synthetic images and a set of real-world WT images and shows promising
performance across both synthetic and real-world data, achieving a Pose
mAP50-95 of 0.97 on real images never seen during training.

Result: 在MMAD基准测试中，EMIT平均提升7.77%性能。

Conclusion: EMIT有效增强MLLMs在IAD中的表现，为领域适应提供新思路。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) plays a crucial role in maintaining the
safety and reliability of manufacturing systems. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) show strong vision-language reasoning abilities, their
effectiveness in IAD remains limited without domain-specific adaptation. In
this work, we propose EMIT, a unified framework that enhances MLLMs for IAD via
difficulty-aware group relative policy optimization (GRPO). EMIT constructs a
multi-task IAD dataset and utilizes GPT-generated object text descriptions to
compensate for missing defective images. For few-shot anomaly detection, it
integrates a soft prompt and heatmap-guided contrastive embeddings derived from
patch-level comparisons. To better handle difficult data samples, i.e., cases
where the MLLM struggles to generate correct answers, we propose a
difficulty-aware GRPO that extends the original GRPO by incorporating a
response resampling strategy to ensure the inclusion of correct answers in the
sampled responses, as well as an advantage reweighting mechanism to strengthen
learning from such difficult data samples. Extensive experiments on the MMAD
benchmark demonstrate that EMIT significantly enhances the IAD performance of
MLLMs, achieving an average improvement of 7.77\% over the base model
(InternVL3-8B) across seven tasks.

Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的多模态修复方法需要架构修改和重新训练，计算成本高，且缺乏对掩码区域的精细控制。

Result: 实验表明，GuidPaint在定性和定量评估上均优于现有上下文感知修复方法。

Conclusion: GuidPaint提供了一种高效、无需训练的修复方案，显著提升了语义一致性和视觉质量。

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have been widely adopted for image
inpainting tasks due to their powerful generative capabilities, achieving
impressive results. Existing multimodal inpainting methods based on diffusion
models often require architectural modifications and retraining, resulting in
high computational cost. In contrast, context-aware diffusion inpainting
methods leverage the model's inherent priors to adjust intermediate denoising
steps, enabling high-quality inpainting without additional training and
significantly reducing computation. However, these methods lack fine-grained
control over the masked regions, often leading to semantically inconsistent or
visually implausible content. To address this issue, we propose GuidPaint, a
training-free, class-guided image inpainting framework. By incorporating
classifier guidance into the denoising process, GuidPaint enables precise
control over intermediate generations within the masked areas, ensuring both
semantic consistency and visual realism. Furthermore, it integrates stochastic
and deterministic sampling, allowing users to select preferred intermediate
results and deterministically refine them. Experimental results demonstrate
that GuidPaint achieves clear improvements over existing context-aware
inpainting methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

LLMs, VAD has undergone significant transformations in terms of data
annotation, input modalities, model architectures, and task objectives. The
surge in publications and the evolution of tasks have created an urgent need

technological advancements and existing bottlenecks, this paper distills key
challenges and outlines future research directions, offering guidance for the

Abstract: Monitoring benthic biodiversity in Antarctica is vital for understanding
ecological change in response to climate-driven pressures. This work is
typically performed using high-resolution imagery captured in situ, though
manual annotation of such data remains laborious and specialised, impeding
large-scale analysis. We present a tailored object detection framework for
identifying and classifying Antarctic benthic organisms in high-resolution
towed camera imagery, alongside the first public computer vision dataset for
benthic biodiversity monitoring in the Weddell Sea. Our approach addresses key
challenges associated with marine ecological imagery, including limited
annotated data, variable object sizes, and complex seafloor structure. The
proposed framework combines resolution-preserving patching, spatial data
augmentation, fine-tuning, and postprocessing via Slicing Aided Hyper
Inference. We benchmark multiple object detection architectures and demonstrate
strong performance in detecting medium and large organisms across 25
fine-grained morphotypes, significantly more than other works in this area.
Detection of small and rare taxa remains a challenge, reflecting limitations in
current detection architectures. Our framework provides a scalable foundation
for future machine-assisted in situ benthic biodiversity monitoring research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs)在固定分辨率下训练，难以扩展到高分辨率图像。训练方法需要大量数据和计算资源，而基于patch的方法存在分布偏移和单调性问题。

Method: 提出APT框架，结合Statistical Matching和Scale-aware Scheduling，解决patch分布一致性和单调性问题，实现更清晰的细节和快速采样。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are generally trained at fixed resolutions,
limiting their capability when scaling up to high-resolution images. While
training-based approaches address this limitation by training on
high-resolution datasets, they require large amounts of data and considerable
computational resources, making them less practical. Consequently,
training-free methods, particularly patch-based approaches, have become a
popular alternative. These methods divide an image into patches and fuse the
denoising paths of each patch, showing strong performance on high-resolution
generation. However, we observe two critical issues for patch-based approaches,
which we call ``patch-level distribution shift" and ``increased patch
monotonicity." To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Path Tracing (APT),
a framework that combines Statistical Matching to ensure patch distributions
remain consistent in upsampled latents and Scale-aware Scheduling to deal with
the patch monotonicity. As a result, APT produces clearer and more refined
details in high-resolution images. In addition, APT enables a shortcut
denoising process, resulting in faster sampling with minimal quality
degradation. Our experimental results confirm that APT produces more detailed
outputs with improved inference speed, providing a practical approach to
high-resolution image generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种分步框架，通过身份阻断和医学语义补偿解决医学图像去标识化问题，同时保留医学语义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去标识化方法无法灵活调整隐私级别且未充分保留医学语义，亟需改进。

Method: 分步框架：身份阻断（调整隐私级别）和医学语义补偿（利用预训练医学模型）；引入特征解耦策略去除残留身份信息。

Result: 在七个数据集和三个下游任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在去标识化中实现了隐私级别灵活调整和医学语义保留的平衡。

Abstract: Medical imaging has significantly advanced computer-aided diagnosis, yet its
re-identification (ReID) risks raise critical privacy concerns, calling for
de-identification (DeID) techniques. Unfortunately, existing DeID methods
neither particularly preserve medical semantics, nor are flexibly adjustable
towards different privacy levels. To address these issues, we propose a
divide-and-conquer framework comprising two steps: (1) Identity-Blocking, which
blocks varying proportions of identity-related regions, to achieve different
privacy levels; and (2) Medical-Semantics-Compensation, which leverages
pre-trained Medical Foundation Models (MFMs) to extract medical semantic
features to compensate the blocked regions. Moreover, recognizing that features
from MFMs may still contain residual identity information, we introduce a
Minimum Description Length principle-based feature decoupling strategy, to
effectively decouple and discard such identity components. Extensive
evaluations against existing approaches across seven datasets and three
downstream tasks, demonstrates our state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像因光线吸收、散射、海洋生物和碎屑导致视觉退化，增强图像对路径检测和自主导航等任务至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种针对水下环境的评估框架，通过度量分析评估现有方法的优缺点，并结合实际匹配策略。

Result: 框架为增强方法提供了鲁棒的上下文感知基准，并展示了视觉改进对SLAM算法性能的影响。

Conclusion: 该框架为水下图像增强技术的实际应用提供了有效的评估工具。

Abstract: We introduce local matching stability and furthest matchable frame as
quantitative measures for evaluating the success of underwater image
enhancement. This enhancement process addresses visual degradation caused by
light absorption, scattering, marine growth, and debris. Enhanced imagery plays
a critical role in downstream tasks such as path detection and autonomous
navigation for underwater vehicles, relying on robust feature extraction and
frame matching. To assess the impact of enhancement techniques on
frame-matching performance, we propose a novel evaluation framework tailored to
underwater environments. Through metric-based analysis, we identify strengths
and limitations of existing approaches and pinpoint gaps in their assessment of
real-world applicability. By incorporating a practical matching strategy, our
framework offers a robust, context-aware benchmark for comparing enhancement
methods. Finally, we demonstrate how visual improvements affect the performance
of a complete real-world algorithm -- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) -- reinforcing the framework's relevance to operational underwater
scenarios.

Motivation: 增强复杂模型（如检测Transformer）的可解释性和透明度，填补研究空白，明确内部组件的具体作用。

Method: 采用消融研究，针对查询嵌入、编码器和解码器的多头自注意力（MHSA）以及解码器的多头交叉注意力（MHCA）层，评估对gIoU和F1-score的影响。

Result: 发现模型特定的鲁棒性模式：DETR对编码器MHSA和解码器MHCA消融敏感，DDETR因多尺度可变形注意力更鲁棒，DINO因前瞻更新规则最鲁棒。还揭示了结构冗余。

Conclusion: 研究推进了DETR的可解释AI，明确了内部组件对性能的贡献，为优化透明度和效率提供了方向。

Abstract: In recent years, Explainable AI has gained traction as an approach to
enhancing model interpretability and transparency, particularly in complex
models such as detection transformers. Despite rapid advancements, a
substantial research gap remains in understanding the distinct roles of
internal components - knowledge that is essential for improving transparency
and efficiency. Inspired by neuroscientific ablation studies, which investigate
the functions of brain regions through selective impairment, we systematically
analyze the impact of ablating key components in three state-of-the-art
detection transformer models: Detection transformer (DETR), deformable
detection transformer (DDETR), and DETR with improved denoising anchor boxes
(DINO). The ablations target query embeddings, encoder and decoder multi-head
self-attentions (MHSA) as well as decoder multi-head cross-attention (MHCA)
layers. We evaluate the effects of these ablations on the performance metrics
gIoU and F1-score, quantifying effects on both the classification and
regression sub-tasks on the COCO dataset. To facilitate reproducibility and
future research, we publicly release the DeepDissect library. Our findings
reveal model-specific resilience patterns: while DETR is particularly sensitive
to ablations in encoder MHSA and decoder MHCA, DDETR's multi-scale deformable
attention enhances robustness, and DINO exhibits the greatest resilience due to
its look-forward twice update rule, which helps distributing knowledge across
blocks. These insights also expose structural redundancies, particularly in
DDETR's and DINO's decoder MHCA layers, highlighting opportunities for model
simplification without sacrificing performance. This study advances XAI for
DETRs by clarifying the contributions of internal components to model
performance, offering insights to optimize and improve transparency and
efficiency in critical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAMITE模型基于SAM2改进，通过原型记忆库和位置提示生成器解决VOT中的遮挡和干扰问题，提升跟踪精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VOT方法忽视时间依赖或泛化性差，且无法有效处理遮挡和干扰，导致跟踪误差传播。

Method: SAMITE引入原型记忆库量化跟踪结果的正确性，过滤低分帧以拦截误差；位置提示生成器提供显式位置线索。

Result: 在六个基准测试中表现优越。

Conclusion: SAMITE有效解决了VOT中的关键挑战，提升了跟踪性能。

Abstract: Visual Object Tracking (VOT) is widely used in applications like autonomous
driving to continuously track targets in videos. Existing methods can be
roughly categorized into template matching and autoregressive methods, where
the former usually neglects the temporal dependencies across frames and the
latter tends to get biased towards the object categories during training,
showing weak generalizability to unseen classes. To address these issues, some
methods propose to adapt the video foundation model SAM2 for VOT, where the
tracking results of each frame would be encoded as memory for conditioning the
rest of frames in an autoregressive manner. Nevertheless, existing methods fail
to overcome the challenges of object occlusions and distractions, and do not
have any measures to intercept the propagation of tracking errors. To tackle
them, we present a SAMITE model, built upon SAM2 with additional modules,
including: (1) Prototypical Memory Bank: We propose to quantify the
feature-wise and position-wise correctness of each frame's tracking results,
and select the best frames to condition subsequent frames. As the features of
occluded and distracting objects are feature-wise and position-wise inaccurate,
their scores would naturally be lower and thus can be filtered to intercept
error propagation; (2) Positional Prompt Generator: To further reduce the
impacts of distractors, we propose to generate positional mask prompts to
provide explicit positional clues for the target, leading to more accurate
tracking. Extensive experiments have been conducted on six benchmarks, showing
the superiority of SAMITE. The code is available at

Result: MAGE在多个评估基准（MME、MMBench、SEED）上表现优于同类工作。

Conclusion: MAGE通过创新对齐机制和训练策略，显著提升了多模态模型的性能。

Abstract: In the latest advancements in multimodal learning, effectively addressing the
spatial and semantic losses of visual data after encoding remains a critical
challenge. This is because the performance of large multimodal models is
positively correlated with the coupling between visual encoders and large
language models. Existing approaches often face issues such as vector gaps or
semantic disparities, resulting in information loss during the propagation
process. To address these issues, we propose MAGE (Multimodal Alignment and
Generation Enhancement), a novel framework that bridges the semantic spaces of
vision and text through an innovative alignment mechanism. By introducing the
Intelligent Alignment Network (IAN), MAGE achieves dimensional and semantic
alignment. To reduce the gap between synonymous heterogeneous data, we employ a
training strategy that combines cross-entropy and mean squared error,
significantly enhancing the alignment effect. Moreover, to enhance MAGE's
"Any-to-Any" capability, we developed a fine-tuning dataset for multimodal
tool-calling instructions to expand the model's output capability boundaries.
Finally, our proposed multimodal large model architecture, MAGE, achieved
significantly better performance compared to similar works across various
evaluation benchmarks, including MME, MMBench, and SEED. Complete code and
appendix are available at: https://github.com/GTCOM-NLP/MAGE.

TL;DR: AdvRF提出了一种对抗性重建反馈框架，用于学习类别无关的差异表示，解决了现有细粒度图像检索方法因依赖预定义类别而导致的泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有细粒度图像检索方法依赖预定义类别，导致检索表示中引入类别特定语义，阻碍了对未见类别的泛化能力。

Method: AdvRF通过结合检索模型的类别感知差异定位和重建模型的类别无关特征学习，将细粒度图像检索重新定义为视觉差异重建任务。

Result: AdvRF在细粒度和粗粒度数据集上均表现出色。

Conclusion: AdvRF通过对抗性重建反馈框架，成功学习到类别无关的差异表示，提升了检索模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing fine-grained image retrieval (FGIR) methods predominantly rely on
supervision from predefined categories to learn discriminative representations
for retrieving fine-grained objects. However, they inadvertently introduce
category-specific semantics into the retrieval representation, creating
semantic dependencies on predefined classes that critically hinder
generalization to unseen categories. To tackle this, we propose AdvRF, a novel
adversarial reconstruction feedback framework aimed at learning
category-agnostic discrepancy representations. Specifically, AdvRF reformulates
FGIR as a visual discrepancy reconstruction task via synergizing category-aware
discrepancy localization from retrieval models with category-agnostic feature
learning from reconstruction models. The reconstruction model exposes residual
discrepancies overlooked by the retrieval model, forcing it to improve
localization accuracy, while the refined signals from the retrieval model guide
the reconstruction model to improve its reconstruction ability. Consequently,
the retrieval model localizes visual differences, while the reconstruction
model encodes these differences into category-agnostic representations. This
representation is then transferred to the retrieval model through knowledge
distillation for efficient deployment. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
demonstrate that our AdvRF achieves impressive performance on both widely-used
fine-grained and coarse-grained datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于少量样本的强化学习框架（RLVR），用于卫星图像任务，无需标注数据，仅需少量示例即可显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感等专业领域标注数据稀缺且昂贵的问题，开发高效、低成本的方法。

Method: 采用1-shot RLVR框架，结合策略梯度优化和轻量级奖励机制（如IoU），仅需少量示例进行训练。

Result: 实验表明，仅需1个示例即可显著提升性能，128个示例可媲美数千标注样本的模型。

Conclusion: RLVR框架为数据稀缺领域提供了一种高效、低成本的解决方案，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language and vision-language models have enabled
strong reasoning capabilities, yet they remain impractical for specialized
domains like remote sensing, where annotated data is scarce and expensive. We
present the first few-shot reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR)
framework for satellite imagery that eliminates the need for caption
supervision--relying solely on lightweight, rule-based binary or IoU-based
rewards. Adapting the "1-shot RLVR" paradigm from language models to
vision-language models, we employ policy-gradient optimization with as few as
one curated example to align model outputs for satellite reasoning tasks.
Comprehensive experiments across multiple remote sensing benchmarks--including
classification, visual question answering, and grounding--show that even a
single example yields substantial improvements over the base model. Scaling to
128 examples matches or exceeds models trained on thousands of annotated
samples. While the extreme one-shot setting can induce mild, task-specific
overfitting, our approach consistently demonstrates robust generalization and
efficiency across diverse tasks. Further, we find that prompt design and loss
weighting significantly influence training stability and final accuracy. Our
method enables cost-effective and data-efficient development of
domain-specialist vision-language reasoning models, offering a pragmatic recipe
for data-scarce fields: start from a compact VLM, curate a handful of
reward-checkable cases, and train via RLVR.

Motivation: 驾驶员疲劳是交通事故的主要原因，现有深度学习模型计算量大、延迟高，不适合资源有限的嵌入式设备。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优异，显著降低计算复杂性和延迟。

Conclusion: LiteFat为嵌入式设备提供了实时、高效的疲劳检测解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting driver fatigue is critical for road safety, as drowsy driving
remains a leading cause of traffic accidents. Many existing solutions rely on
computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency
and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as
intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent
accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph
learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining
high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting
streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark
detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data
processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a
feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network
is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low
latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs
competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and
latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the
development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems
that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.

Motivation: 标准ViT存在参数冗余和计算成本高的问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出MoR-ViT框架，采用动态递归机制，使每个token自适应确定处理深度。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上实现最高精度，参数减少70%，推理加速2.5倍。

Conclusion: 动态递归是高效ViT的有效策略，为实际应用开辟新途径。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in image
recognition, yet standard ViT architectures are hampered by substantial
parameter redundancy and high computational cost, limiting their practical
deployment. While recent efforts on efficient ViTs primarily focus on static
model compression or token-level sparsification, they remain constrained by
fixed computational depth for all tokens. In this work, we present MoR-ViT, a
novel vision transformer framework that, for the first time, incorporates a
token-level dynamic recursion mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Recursions
(MoR) paradigm. This approach enables each token to adaptively determine its
processing depth, yielding a flexible and input-dependent allocation of
computational resources. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and transfer
benchmarks demonstrate that MoR-ViT not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
with up to 70% parameter reduction and 2.5x inference acceleration, but also
outperforms leading efficient ViT baselines such as DynamicViT and TinyViT
under comparable conditions. These results establish dynamic recursion as an
effective strategy for efficient vision transformers and open new avenues for
scalable and deployable deep learning models in real-world scenarios.

Result: 在CASME II和SAMM数据集上，AU-LLM通过LOSO和跨域协议验证，达到了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: AU-LLM展示了LLM在微表情分析中的潜力和鲁棒性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The detection of micro-expression Action Units (AUs) is a formidable
challenge in affective computing, pivotal for decoding subtle, involuntary
human emotions. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate profound
reasoning abilities, their application to the fine-grained, low-intensity
domain of micro-expression AU detection remains unexplored. This paper pioneers
this direction by introducing \textbf{AU-LLM}, a novel framework that for the
first time uses LLM to detect AUs in micro-expression datasets with subtle
intensities and the scarcity of data. We specifically address the critical
vision-language semantic gap, the \textbf{Enhanced Fusion Projector (EFP)}. The
EFP employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to intelligently fuse mid-level
(local texture) and high-level (global semantics) visual features from a
specialized 3D-CNN backbone into a single, information-dense token. This
compact representation effectively empowers the LLM to perform nuanced
reasoning over subtle facial muscle movements.Through extensive evaluations on
the benchmark CASME II and SAMM datasets, including stringent
Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) and cross-domain protocols, AU-LLM establishes a
new state-of-the-art, validating the significant potential and robustness of
LLM-based reasoning for micro-expression analysis. The codes are available at

Conclusion: MSGCoOp在少样本和跨域泛化任务中表现优异，计算高效。

Abstract: Vision-language pre-trained models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, and prompt learning has emerged as an
efficient alternative to full fine-tuning. However, existing methods often
struggle with generalization to novel classes, a phenomenon attributed to
overfitting on seen classes and forgetting general knowledge. Furthermore,
recent approaches that improve generalization often introduce complex
architectures or heavy computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a
Multiple Semantic-Guided Context Optimization (MSGCoOp) framework to enhance
few-shot generalization while maintaining computational efficiency. Our
approach leverages an ensemble of parallel learnable context vectors to capture
diverse semantic aspects. To enrich these prompts, we introduce a semantic
guidance mechanism that aligns them with comprehensive class descriptions
automatically generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). Furthermore, a
diversity regularization loss encourages the prompts to learn complementary and
orthogonal features, preventing them from collapsing into redundant
representations. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets show that
MSGCoOp significantly improves performance on base-to-novel generalization,
achieving an average harmonic mean improvement of 1.10\% over the strong KgCoOp
baseline. Our method also demonstrates enhanced robustness in cross-domain
generalization tasks. Our code is avaliable at:

Conclusion: 该框架通过不确定性建模和结构化文本，显著提升了医学图像-文本预训练的效果。

Abstract: Medical image-language pre-training aims to align medical images with
clinically relevant text to improve model performance on various downstream
tasks. However, existing models often struggle with the variability and
ambiguity inherent in medical data, limiting their ability to capture nuanced
clinical information and uncertainty. This work introduces an uncertainty-aware
medical image-text pre-training model that enhances generalization capabilities
in medical image analysis. Building on previous methods and focusing on Chest
X-Rays, our approach utilizes structured text reports generated by a large
language model (LLM) to augment image data with clinically relevant context.
These reports begin with a definition of the disease, followed by the
`appearance' section to highlight critical regions of interest, and finally
`observations' and `verdicts' that ground model predictions in clinical
semantics. By modeling both inter- and intra-modal uncertainty, our framework
captures the inherent ambiguity in medical images and text, yielding improved
representations and performance on downstream tasks. Our model demonstrates
significant advances in medical image-text pre-training, obtaining
state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks.

Abstract: Creating immersive and playable 3D worlds from texts or images remains a
fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Existing world
generation approaches typically fall into two categories: video-based methods
that offer rich diversity but lack 3D consistency and rendering efficiency, and
3D-based methods that provide geometric consistency but struggle with limited
training data and memory-inefficient representations. To address these
limitations, we present HunyuanWorld 1.0, a novel framework that combines the
best of both worlds for generating immersive, explorable, and interactive 3D
scenes from text and image conditions. Our approach features three key
advantages: 1) 360{\deg} immersive experiences via panoramic world proxies; 2)
mesh export capabilities for seamless compatibility with existing computer
graphics pipelines; 3) disentangled object representations for augmented
interactivity. The core of our framework is a semantically layered 3D mesh
representation that leverages panoramic images as 360{\deg} world proxies for
semantic-aware world decomposition and reconstruction, enabling the generation
of diverse 3D worlds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating coherent, explorable, and
interactive 3D worlds while enabling versatile applications in virtual reality,

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in alignment and content moderation, large
language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) systems remain vulnerable to
prompt-based attacks known as jailbreaks. Unlike traditional adversarial
examples requiring expert knowledge, many of today's jailbreaks are low-effort,
high-impact crafted by everyday users with nothing more than cleverly worded
prompts. This paper presents a systems-style investigation into how non-experts
reliably circumvent safety mechanisms through techniques such as multi-turn
narrative escalation, lexical camouflage, implication chaining, fictional
impersonation, and subtle semantic edits. We propose a unified taxonomy of
prompt-level jailbreak strategies spanning both text-output and T2I models,
grounded in empirical case studies across popular APIs. Our analysis reveals
that every stage of the moderation pipeline, from input filtering to output
validation, can be bypassed with accessible strategies. We conclude by
highlighting the urgent need for context-aware defenses that reflect the ease

### [118] [Cross-Architecture Distillation Made Simple with Redundancy Suppression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21844)
*Weijia Zhang,Yuehao Liu,Wu Ran,Chao Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种简单的跨架构知识蒸馏方法，通过抑制冗余信息实现知识迁移，避免了复杂模块和过多参数，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨架构知识蒸馏方法引入复杂模块和过多参数，影响效率和适用性，需简化设计。

Method: 提出冗余抑制蒸馏（RSD）损失，包含跨架构不变性最大化和特征去相关目标，并设计轻量模块保护学生模型的架构特定能力。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1k基准测试中优于OFA方法，参数开销更小。

Conclusion: 该方法为跨架构蒸馏领域提供了一个简单而强大的基线。

Abstract: We describe a simple method for cross-architecture knowledge distillation,
where the knowledge transfer is cast into a redundant information suppression
formulation. Existing methods introduce sophisticated modules,
architecture-tailored designs, and excessive parameters, which impair their
efficiency and applicability. We propose to extract the architecture-agnostic
knowledge in heterogeneous representations by reducing the redundant
architecture-exclusive information. To this end, we present a simple redundancy
suppression distillation (RSD) loss, which comprises cross-architecture
invariance maximisation and feature decorrelation objectives. To prevent the
student from entirely losing its architecture-specific capabilities, we further
design a lightweight module that decouples the RSD objective from the student's
internal representations. Our method is devoid of the architecture-specific
designs and complex operations in the pioneering method of OFA. It outperforms
OFA on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k benchmarks with only a fraction of their
parameter overhead, which highlights its potential as a simple and strong
baseline to the cross-architecture distillation community.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMFNet提出了一种选择性跨模态融合框架，通过像素级选择性融合策略和多维选择性注意力模块，优化了RGB-D视频显著性检测中光流和深度的利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-D VSOD模型在利用光流和深度时未考虑其在不同场景中的贡献差异，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出选择性跨模态融合框架（SMFNet），包括像素级选择性融合策略（PSF）和多维选择性注意力模块（MSAM）。

Result: 在多个数据集上评估，SMFNet优于19种现有模型，成为最全面的RGB-D VSOD基准。

Conclusion: SMFNet通过选择性融合和注意力机制，显著提升了RGB-D视频显著性检测的性能。

Abstract: Applying salient object detection (SOD) to RGB-D videos is an emerging task
called RGB-D VSOD and has recently gained increasing interest, due to
considerable performance gains of incorporating motion and depth and that RGB-D
videos can be easily captured now in daily life. Existing RGB-D VSOD models
have different attempts to derive motion cues, in which extracting motion
information explicitly from optical flow appears to be a more effective and
promising alternative. Despite this, there remains a key issue that how to
effectively utilize optical flow and depth to assist the RGB modality in SOD.
Previous methods always treat optical flow and depth equally with respect to
model designs, without explicitly considering their unequal contributions in
individual scenarios, limiting the potential of motion and depth. To address
this issue and unleash the power of motion and depth, we propose a novel
selective cross-modal fusion framework (SMFNet) for RGB-D VSOD, incorporating a
pixel-level selective fusion strategy (PSF) that achieves optimal fusion of
optical flow and depth based on their actual contributions. Besides, we propose
a multi-dimensional selective attention module (MSAM) to integrate the fused
features derived from PSF with the remaining RGB modality at multiple
dimensions, effectively enhancing feature representation to generate refined
features. We conduct comprehensive evaluation of SMFNet against 19
state-of-the-art models on both RDVS and DVisal datasets, making the evaluation
the most comprehensive RGB-D VSOD benchmark up to date, and it also
demonstrates the superiority of SMFNet over other models. Meanwhile, evaluation
on five video benchmark datasets incorporating synthetic depth validates the
efficacy of SMFNet as well. Our code and benchmark results are made publicly
available at https://github.com/Jia-hao999/SMFNet.

TL;DR: Vid-TTA是一个轻量级的测试时自适应框架，通过自监督辅助任务优化视频编辑，提升时间一致性和减少提示过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法存在时间不一致性和提示过拟合问题，且计算资源需求高。

Method: 采用运动感知帧重建和提示扰动策略，结合元学习动态损失平衡机制。

Result: 显著提升时间一致性，减少过拟合，计算开销低。

Conclusion: Vid-TTA为现有视频编辑模型提供即插即用的性能提升。

Abstract: Video editing is a critical component of content creation that transforms raw
footage into coherent works aligned with specific visual and narrative
objectives. Existing approaches face two major challenges: temporal
inconsistencies due to failure in capturing complex motion patterns, and
overfitting to simple prompts arising from limitations in UNet backbone
architectures. While learning-based methods can enhance editing quality, they
typically demand substantial computational resources and are constrained by the
scarcity of high-quality annotated data. In this paper, we present Vid-TTA, a
lightweight test-time adaptation framework that personalizes optimization for
each test video during inference through self-supervised auxiliary tasks. Our
approach incorporates a motion-aware frame reconstruction mechanism that
identifies and preserves crucial movement regions, alongside a prompt
perturbation and reconstruction strategy that strengthens model robustness to
diverse textual descriptions. These innovations are orchestrated by a
meta-learning driven dynamic loss balancing mechanism that adaptively adjusts
the optimization process based on video characteristics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Vid-TTA significantly improves video temporal consistency and
mitigates prompt overfitting while maintaining low computational overhead,
offering a plug-and-play performance boost for existing video editing models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在利用视觉线索进行消歧时表现不佳，且单一指向线假设可能导致性能下降。

Method: 提出双模型框架，分别学习头部到指尖和手腕到指尖方向；引入高斯射线热图表示和CLIP-Aware集成模块；增加对象中心预测辅助任务。

Result: 在YouRefIt数据集上，0.25 IoU阈值下提升了约4 mAP。

Conclusion: 双模型框架和多模态集成显著提升了指向性理解的性能。

Abstract: We address the problem of Embodied Reference Understanding, which involves
predicting the object that a person in the scene is referring to through both
pointing gesture and language. Accurately identifying the referent requires
multimodal understanding: integrating textual instructions, visual pointing,
and scene context. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively
leverage visual clues for disambiguation. We also observe that, while the
referent is often aligned with the head-to-fingertip line, it occasionally
aligns more closely with the wrist-to-fingertip line. Therefore, relying on a
single line assumption can be overly simplistic and may lead to suboptimal
performance. To address this, we propose a dual-model framework, where one
model learns from the head-to-fingertip direction and the other from the
wrist-to-fingertip direction. We further introduce a Gaussian ray heatmap
representation of these lines and use them as input to provide a strong
supervisory signal that encourages the model to better attend to pointing cues.
To combine the strengths of both models, we present the CLIP-Aware Pointing
Ensemble module, which performs a hybrid ensemble based on CLIP features.
Additionally, we propose an object center prediction head as an auxiliary task
to further enhance referent localization. We validate our approach through
extensive experiments and analysis on the benchmark YouRefIt dataset, achieving
an improvement of approximately 4 mAP at the 0.25 IoU threshold.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统文本到视觉流水线方法的局限性，实现多模态叙事的协同生成，提升叙事质量和沉浸感。

Method: 框架包括Narrator（生成文本和多模态提示）、Director（管理动态场景图）、Narrative Arc Controller（指导故事结构）和Affective Tone Mapper（确保情感一致性）。

Result: 在多样化叙事提示的定性评估中，Aether Weaver在叙事深度、视觉保真度和情感共鸣方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该集成框架为快速创意原型设计和沉浸式叙事体验提供了强大平台。

Abstract: We introduce Aether Weaver, a novel, integrated framework for multimodal
narrative co-generation that overcomes limitations of sequential text-to-visual
pipelines. Our system concurrently synthesizes textual narratives, dynamic
scene graph representations, visual scenes, and affective soundscapes, driven
by a tightly integrated, co-generation mechanism. At its core, the Narrator, a
large language model, generates narrative text and multimodal prompts, while
the Director acts as a dynamic scene graph manager, and analyzes the text to
build and maintain a structured representation of the story's world, ensuring
spatio-temporal and relational consistency for visual rendering and subsequent
narrative generation. Additionally, a Narrative Arc Controller guides the
high-level story structure, influencing multimodal affective consistency,
further complemented by an Affective Tone Mapper that ensures congruent
emotional expression across all modalities. Through qualitative evaluations on
a diverse set of narrative prompts encompassing various genres, we demonstrate
that Aether Weaver significantly enhances narrative depth, visual fidelity, and
emotional resonance compared to cascaded baseline approaches. This integrated
framework provides a robust platform for rapid creative prototyping and
immersive storytelling experiences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术对数字媒体真实性构成威胁，现有检测器在真实场景中的效果尚未验证。

Method: 提出一种模拟真实场景的测试流程，使用先进生成方法创建包含50万张高质量深度伪造图像的数据集。

Result: 检测效果不佳，仅不到一半检测器的AUC超过60%，最低为50%；基础图像处理会显著降低性能。

Conclusion: 深度伪造检测仍具挑战性，需进一步改进检测方法。

Abstract: Deepfakes powered by advanced machine learning models present a significant
and evolving threat to identity verification and the authenticity of digital
media. Although numerous detectors have been developed to address this problem,
their effectiveness has yet to be tested when applied to real-world data. In
this work we evaluate modern deepfake detectors, introducing a novel testing
procedure designed to mimic real-world scenarios for deepfake detection. Using
state-of-the-art deepfake generation methods, we create a comprehensive dataset
containing more than 500,000 high-quality deepfake images. Our analysis shows
that detecting deepfakes still remains a challenging task. The evaluation shows
that in fewer than half of the deepfake detectors tested achieved an AUC score
greater than 60%, with the lowest being 50%. We demonstrate that basic image
manipulations, such as JPEG compression or image enhancement, can significantly
reduce model performance. All code and data are publicly available at

Conclusion: 需谨慎数据选择和偏见缓解，以确保AI在病理学中的公平应用。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated success in computational
pathology (CPath) for disease detection, biomarker classification, and
prognosis prediction. However, its potential to learn unintended demographic
biases, particularly those related to social determinants of health, remains
understudied. This study investigates whether deep learning models can predict
self-reported race from digitized dermatopathology slides and identifies
potential morphological shortcuts. Using a multisite dataset with a racially
diverse population, we apply an attention-based mechanism to uncover
race-associated morphological features. After evaluating three dataset curation
strategies to control for confounding factors, the final experiment showed that
White and Black demographic groups retained high prediction performance (AUC:
0.799, 0.762), while overall performance dropped to 0.663. Attention analysis
revealed the epidermis as a key predictive feature, with significant
performance declines when these regions were removed. These findings highlight
the need for careful data curation and bias mitigation to ensure equitable AI
deployment in pathology. Code available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数字化艺术品分析中的视觉解读和艺术、历史背景知识结合的挑战。

Method: 整合了多模态检索模块、对比多任务分类网络和基于上下文的推理策略，利用WikiFragments数据集支持知识驱动的多模态推理。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得最佳成绩，如风格分类F1提升8.4%，ArtPedia上的标题生成BLEU@1提升7.1。

Conclusion: ArtSeek能有效解读视觉主题、推断历史背景，适用于需要外部知识的领域，支持可扩展的多模态AI研究。

Abstract: Analyzing digitized artworks presents unique challenges, requiring not only
visual interpretation but also a deep understanding of rich artistic,
contextual, and historical knowledge. We introduce ArtSeek, a multimodal
framework for art analysis that combines multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. Unlike prior work, our pipeline relies only on
image input, enabling applicability to artworks without links to Wikidata or
Wikipedia-common in most digitized collections. ArtSeek integrates three key
components: an intelligent multimodal retrieval module based on late
interaction retrieval, a contrastive multitask classification network for
predicting artist, genre, style, media, and tags, and an agentic reasoning
strategy enabled through in-context examples for complex visual question
answering and artwork explanation via Qwen2.5-VL. Central to this approach is
WikiFragments, a Wikipedia-scale dataset of image-text fragments curated to
support knowledge-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including a +8.4% F1
improvement in style classification over GraphCLIP and a +7.1 BLEU@1 gain in
captioning on ArtPedia. Qualitative analyses show that ArtSeek can interpret
visual motifs, infer historical context, and retrieve relevant knowledge, even
for obscure works. Though focused on visual arts, our approach generalizes to
other domains requiring external knowledge, supporting scalable multimodal AI
research. Both the dataset and the source code will be made publicly available
at https://github.com/cilabuniba/artseek.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Transformer的模型SwinECAT，用于解决眼底图像分析中的小病灶和疾病间差异细微的问题，实现了更高的分类准确率和细粒度诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼底图像分析面临小病灶区域和疾病间差异细微的挑战，导致模型预测精度下降和过拟合。

Method: 结合Shifted Window (Swin) Attention和Efficient Channel Attention (ECA)机制，提出SwinECAT模型，以捕捉局部空间结构和长程依赖关系，并优化特征通道注意力。

Result: 在包含16,140张眼底图像的Eye Disease Image Dataset (EDID)上，SwinECAT实现了88.29%的准确率，加权F1分数0.88，宏F1分数0.90，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: SwinECAT在9类眼底疾病分类任务中表现优异，是目前公开数据集上性能最高的模型。

Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence has been increasingly applied in the
field of medical imaging. Among these applications, fundus image analysis
presents special challenges, including small lesion areas in certain fundus
diseases and subtle inter-disease differences, which can lead to reduced
prediction accuracy and overfitting in the models. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes the Transformer-based model SwinECAT, which combines the
Shifted Window (Swin) Attention with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA)
Attention. SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin
Transformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and
long-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is
incorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature
channels, enabling more discriminative feature representation. In contrast to
previous studies that typically classify fundus images into 4 to 6 categories,
this work expands fundus disease classification to 9 distinct types, thereby
enhancing the granularity of diagnosis. We evaluate our method on the Eye
Disease Image Dataset (EDID) containing 16,140 fundus images for 9-category
classification. Experimental results demonstrate that SwinECAT achieves 88.29\%
accuracy, with weighted F1-score of 0.88 and macro F1-score of 0.90. The
classification results of our proposed model SwinECAT significantly outperform
the baseline Swin Transformer and multiple compared baseline models. To our
knowledge, this represents the highest reported performance for 9-category
classification on this public dataset.

TL;DR: MMAT-1M是一个百万规模的多模态代理调优数据集，旨在提升多模态大语言模型在思维链、反思和动态工具使用方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态领域缺乏大规模、高质量的代理调优数据集，限制了多模态大语言模型的潜力。

Method: 通过四阶段数据引擎构建MMAT-1M：1) 收集公开多模态数据集；2) 使用GPT-4o生成理性并动态整合API调用和RAG信息；3) 通过反思优化理性；4) 可选地将多轮对话压缩为单轮格式。

Result: 在MMAT-1M上微调的多模态模型表现显著提升，例如InternVL2.5-8B-RR在多个基准测试中平均提升2.7%，在Dyn-VQA上提升8.8%。

Conclusion: MMAT-1M有效增强了多模态推理和工具使用能力，数据集已公开。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), enhanced through agent tuning, have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and tool
utilization, significantly surpassing the performance of standalone models.
However, the multimodal domain still lacks a large-scale, high-quality agent
tuning dataset to unlock the full potential of multimodal large language
models. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMAT-1M, the first million-scale
multimodal agent tuning dataset designed to support CoT, reflection, and
dynamic tool usage. Our dataset is constructed through a novel four-stage data
engine: 1) We first curate publicly available multimodal datasets containing
question-answer pairs; 2) Then, leveraging GPT-4o, we generate rationales for
the original question-answer pairs and dynamically integrate API calls and
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) information through a multi-turn paradigm;
3) Furthermore, we refine the rationales through reflection to ensure logical
consistency and accuracy, creating a multi-turn dialogue dataset with both
Rationale and Reflection (RR); 4) Finally, to enhance efficiency, we optionally
compress multi-turn dialogues into a One-turn Rationale and Reflection (ORR)
format. By fine-tuning open-source multimodal models on the MMAT-1M, we observe
significant performance gains. For instance, the InternVL2.5-8B-RR model
achieves an average improvement of 2.7% across eight public benchmarks and 8.8%
on the RAG benchmark Dyn-VQA, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in
enhancing multimodal reasoning and tool-based capabilities. The dataset is
publicly available at https://github.com/VIS-MPU-Agent/MMAT-1M.

Motivation: 现有方法无法有效建模多模态线索（如音乐）或忽略跨模态协作和时间动态，导致对复杂交互和关键性能变化的捕捉不足。

Method: LMAC-Net通过多模态注意力一致性机制对齐多模态特征，结合局部查询编码模块和两级评分，优化多模态对齐与评分融合。

Result: 在RG和Fis-V数据集上的实验表明，LMAC-Net显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LMAC-Net通过多模态对齐和优化，有效提升了长期动作质量评估的准确性。

Abstract: Long-term action quality assessment (AQA) focuses on evaluating the quality
of human activities in videos lasting up to several minutes. This task plays an
important role in the automated evaluation of artistic sports such as rhythmic
gymnastics and figure skating, where both accurate motion execution and
temporal synchronization with background music are essential for performance
assessment. However, existing methods predominantly fall into two categories:
unimodal approaches that rely solely on visual features, which are inadequate
for modeling multimodal cues like music; and multimodal approaches that
typically employ simple feature-level contrastive fusion, overlooking deep
cross-modal collaboration and temporal dynamics. As a result, they struggle to
capture complex interactions between modalities and fail to accurately track
critical performance changes throughout extended sequences. To address these
challenges, we propose the Long-term Multimodal Attention Consistency Network
(LMAC-Net). LMAC-Net introduces a multimodal attention consistency mechanism to
explicitly align multimodal features, enabling stable integration of visual and
audio information and enhancing feature representations. Specifically, we
introduce a multimodal local query encoder module to capture temporal semantics
and cross-modal relations, and use a two-level score evaluation for
interpretable results. In addition, attention-based and regression-based losses
are applied to jointly optimize multimodal alignment and score fusion.
Experiments conducted on the RG and Fis-V datasets demonstrate that LMAC-Net
significantly outperforms existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our
proposed approach.

Motivation: 现有数据自由量化方法在生成合成图像时存在多义性问题，导致量化模型性能下降。

Method: 提出mixup-class prompt策略，通过融合多个类别标签生成多样且鲁棒的合成数据，结合现有PTQ算法。

Result: 在CNN和ViT上实验表明，该方法优于现有DFQ方法，并在极低位量化场景（如W2A4）中达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: mixup-class prompt策略有效提升了量化模型的泛化能力和优化稳定性，尤其在低比特量化中表现优异。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) improves efficiency but struggles with
limited calibration data, especially under privacy constraints. Data-free
quantization (DFQ) mitigates this by generating synthetic images using
generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and
text-conditioned latent diffusion models (LDMs), while applying existing PTQ
algorithms. However, the relationship between generated synthetic images and
the generalizability of the quantized model during PTQ remains underexplored.
Without investigating this relationship, synthetic images generated by previous
prompt engineering methods based on single-class prompts suffer from issues
such as polysemy, leading to performance degradation. We propose
\textbf{mixup-class prompt}, a mixup-based text prompting strategy that fuses
multiple class labels at the text prompt level to generate diverse, robust
synthetic data. This approach enhances generalization, and improves
optimization stability in PTQ. We provide quantitative insights through
gradient norm and generalization error analysis. Experiments on convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) show that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art DFQ methods like GenQ. Furthermore,
it pushes the performance boundary in extremely low-bit scenarios, achieving
new state-of-the-art accuracy in challenging 2-bit weight, 4-bit activation
(W2A4) quantization.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖阴影掩码，但在真实场景中难以获取。利用局部对比信息等内在图像线索存在模糊性问题。

Method: 提出AGBA机制动态过滤和重加权对比先验，结合FCFN网络利用高频和对比线索生成细节。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在无掩码方法中达到最优，且与基于掩码的方法性能相当。

Conclusion: AGBA和FCFN有效解决了阴影去除中的模糊性和细节恢复问题。

Abstract: Existing shadow removal methods often rely on shadow masks, which are
challenging to acquire in real-world scenarios. Exploring intrinsic image cues,
such as local contrast information, presents a potential alternative for
guiding shadow removal in the absence of explicit masks. However, the cue's
inherent ambiguity becomes a critical limitation in complex scenes, where it
can fail to distinguish true shadows from low-reflectance objects and intricate
background textures. To address this motivation, we propose the Adaptive Gated
Dual-Branch Attention (AGBA) mechanism. AGBA dynamically filters and re-weighs
the contrast prior to effectively disentangle shadow features from confounding
visual elements. Furthermore, to tackle the persistent challenge of restoring
soft shadow boundaries and fine-grained details, we introduce a diffusion-based
Frequency-Contrast Fusion Network (FCFN) that leverages high-frequency and
contrast cues to guide the generative process. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results among mask-free
approaches while maintaining competitive performance relative to mask-based
methods.

Motivation: 解决现有CLIP模型在处理非英语数据和多语言性能下降（“多语言诅咒”）方面的挑战。

Result: 在零样本ImageNet分类中超越英语专用模型，并在多语言基准测试中创下新纪录。

Conclusion: MetaCLIP 2为多语言CLIP训练提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is a popular foundation model,
supporting from zero-shot classification, retrieval to encoders for multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). Although CLIP is successfully trained on
billion-scale image-text pairs from the English world, scaling CLIP's training
further to learning from the worldwide web data is still challenging: (1) no
curation method is available to handle data points from non-English world; (2)
the English performance from existing multilingual CLIP is worse than its
English-only counterpart, i.e., "curse of multilinguality" that is common in
LLMs. Here, we present MetaCLIP 2, the first recipe training CLIP from scratch
on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs. To generalize our findings, we conduct
rigorous ablations with minimal changes that are necessary to address the above
challenges and present a recipe enabling mutual benefits from English and
non-English world data. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP 2
ViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%,
and surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding
factors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual

Abstract: Scarcity of pixel-level labels is a significant challenge in practical
scenarios. In specific domains like industrial smoke, acquiring such detailed
annotations is particularly difficult and often requires expert knowledge. To
alleviate this, weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has emerged as a
promising approach. However, due to the supervision gap and inherent bias in
models trained with only image level labels, existing WSSS methods suffer from
limitations such as incomplete foreground coverage, inaccurate object
boundaries, and spurious correlations, especially in our domain, where
emissions are always spatially coupled with chimneys.
  Previous solutions typically rely on additional priors or external knowledge
to mitigate these issues, but they often lack scalability and fail to address
the model's inherent bias toward co-occurring context. To address this, we
propose a novel WSSS framework that directly targets the co-occurrence problem
without relying on external supervision. Unlike prior methods that adopt a
single network, we employ a teacher-student framework that combines CNNs and
ViTs. We introduce a knowledge transfer loss that enforces cross-architecture
consistency by aligning internal representations. Additionally, we incorporate
post-processing techniques to address partial coverage and further improve
pseudo mask quality.

Conclusion: PanoSplatt3R展示了无需姿态信息的全景重建潜力，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Wide-baseline panorama reconstruction has emerged as a highly effective and
pivotal approach for not only achieving geometric reconstruction of the
surrounding 3D environment, but also generating highly realistic and immersive
novel views. Although existing methods have shown remarkable performance across
various benchmarks, they are predominantly reliant on accurate pose
information. In real-world scenarios, the acquisition of precise pose often
requires additional computational resources and is highly susceptible to noise.
These limitations hinder the broad applicability and practicality of such
methods. In this paper, we present PanoSplatt3R, an unposed wide-baseline
panorama reconstruction method. We extend and adapt the foundational
reconstruction pretrainings from the perspective domain to the panoramic
domain, thus enabling powerful generalization capabilities. To ensure a
seamless and efficient domain-transfer process, we introduce RoPE rolling that
spans rolled coordinates in rotary positional embeddings across different
attention heads, maintaining a minimal modification to RoPE's mechanism, while
modeling the horizontal periodicity of panorama images. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that PanoSplatt3R, even in the absence of pose
information, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. This
superiority is evident in both the generation of high-quality novel views and
the accuracy of depth estimation, thereby showcasing its great potential for
practical applications. Project page: https://npucvr.github.io/PanoSplatt3R

<details>

Motivation: 心血管疾病是全球主要死因，早期检测至关重要。心电图图像在临床中广泛使用，但人工解读耗时且依赖专家知识，因此需要自动化工具。

Method: 采用预处理管道减少视觉噪声，并使用两阶段微调策略：先在合成和外部数据集上微调，再在目标数据集上进一步微调，采用ConvNeXt架构。

Result: 在公开验证集和私有测试集上的AUROC分数分别为0.9688和0.9677，表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了作为临床工作流程中自动化心电图解读工具的潜力。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading global cause of death, and
early detection is essential to improve patient outcomes. Electrocardiograms
(ECGs), especially 12-lead ECGs, play a key role in the identification of CVDs.
These are routinely interpreted by human experts, a process that is
time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. Historical research in this area
has focused on automatic ECG interpretation from digital signals, with recent
deep learning approaches achieving strong results. In practice, however, most
ECG data in clinical practice are stored or shared in image form. To bridge
this gap, we propose a deep learning framework designed specifically to
classify paper-like ECG images into five main diagnostic categories. Our method
was the winning entry to the 2024 British Heart Foundation Open Data Science
Challenge. It addresses two main challenges of paper ECG classification: visual
noise (e.g., shadows or creases) and the need to detect fine-detailed waveform
patterns. We propose a pre-processing pipeline that reduces visual noise and a
two-stage fine-tuning strategy: the model is first fine-tuned on synthetic and
external ECG image datasets to learn domain-specific features, and then further
fine-tuned on the target dataset to enhance disease-specific recognition. We
adopt the ConvNeXt architecture as the backbone of our model. Our method
achieved AUROC scores of 0.9688 on the public validation set and 0.9677 on the
private test set of the British Heart Foundation Open Data Science Challenge,
highlighting its potential as a practical tool for automated ECG interpretation
in clinical workflows.

Motivation: 事件相机具有高动态范围和精细时间分辨率，但稀疏和噪声的事件流以及多模态数据融合的挑战限制了其在语义分割中的应用。

Method: 提出EIFNet，包含自适应事件特征细化模块（AEFRM）、模态自适应重校准模块（MARM）和多头注意力门控融合模块（MGFM），通过注意力机制和门控策略优化特征提取与融合。

Result: 在DDD17-Semantic和DSEC-Semantic数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: EIFNet有效解决了事件流稀疏性和多模态融合问题，提升了事件相机的语义分割能力。

Abstract: Event-based semantic segmentation explores the potential of event cameras,
which offer high dynamic range and fine temporal resolution, to achieve robust
scene understanding in challenging environments. Despite these advantages, the
task remains difficult due to two main challenges: extracting reliable features
from sparse and noisy event streams, and effectively fusing them with dense,
semantically rich image data that differ in structure and representation. To
address these issues, we propose EIFNet, a multi-modal fusion network that
combines the strengths of both event and frame-based inputs. The network
includes an Adaptive Event Feature Refinement Module (AEFRM), which improves
event representations through multi-scale activity modeling and spatial
attention. In addition, we introduce a Modality-Adaptive Recalibration Module
(MARM) and a Multi-Head Attention Gated Fusion Module (MGFM), which align and
integrate features across modalities using attention mechanisms and gated
fusion strategies. Experiments on DDD17-Semantic and DSEC-Semantic datasets
show that EIFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its
effectiveness in event-based semantic segmentation.

Method: 提出MMN网络，包括运动引导骨骼调制模块（MSM）和运动引导时间调制模块（MTM），并通过运动一致性学习策略聚合多尺度特征的运动线索。

Result: 在Micro-Action 52和iMiGUE数据集上，MMN取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 显式建模细微运动线索对微动作识别至关重要，MMN为相关研究提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Micro-Actions (MAs) are an important form of non-verbal communication in
social interactions, with potential applications in human emotional analysis.
However, existing methods in Micro-Action Recognition often overlook the
inherent subtle changes in MAs, which limits the accuracy of distinguishing MAs
with subtle changes. To address this issue, we present a novel Motion-guided
Modulation Network (MMN) that implicitly captures and modulates subtle motion
cues to enhance spatial-temporal representation learning. Specifically, we
introduce a Motion-guided Skeletal Modulation module (MSM) to inject motion
cues at the skeletal level, acting as a control signal to guide spatial
representation modeling. In parallel, we design a Motion-guided Temporal
Modulation module (MTM) to incorporate motion information at the frame level,
facilitating the modeling of holistic motion patterns in micro-actions.
Finally, we propose a motion consistency learning strategy to aggregate the
motion cues from multi-scale features for micro-action classification.
Experimental results on the Micro-Action 52 and iMiGUE datasets demonstrate
that MMN achieves state-of-the-art performance in skeleton-based micro-action
recognition, underscoring the importance of explicitly modeling subtle motion
cues. The code will be available at https://github.com/momiji-bit/MMN.

Method: 提出ZIUM方法，支持零样本对抗攻击和意图定制，无需额外优化。

Result: ZIUM在多种机器遗忘场景中表现优异，攻击成功率高且时间成本低。

Conclusion: ZIUM为机器遗忘模型的安全研究提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) removes specific data points or concepts from deep
learning models to enhance privacy and prevent sensitive content generation.
Adversarial prompts can exploit unlearned models to generate content containing
removed concepts, posing a significant security risk. However, existing
adversarial attack methods still face challenges in generating content that
aligns with an attacker's intent while incurring high computational costs to
identify successful prompts. To address these challenges, we propose ZIUM, a
Zero-shot Intent-aware adversarial attack on Unlearned Models, which enables
the flexible customization of target attack images to reflect an attacker's
intent. Additionally, ZIUM supports zero-shot adversarial attacks without
requiring further optimization for previously attacked unlearned concepts. The
evaluation across various MU scenarios demonstrated ZIUM's effectiveness in
successfully customizing content based on user-intent prompts while achieving a
superior attack success rate compared to existing methods. Moreover, its
zero-shot adversarial attack significantly reduces the attack time for
previously attacked unlearned concepts.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的方法，通过染色和锁定计算机视觉模型来保护知识产权，无需微调或重新训练，且对模型性能影响最小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护模型所有者的知识产权，防止未经授权的使用或复制。

Method: 通过直接修改少量模型权重实现染色和锁定，锁定模型需在输入图像中插入触发补丁才能使用。

Result: 实验证明该方法有效，且对模型性能影响极小。

Conclusion: 新方法为模型保护提供了高效且可证明的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce new methods of staining and locking computer vision models, to
protect their owners' intellectual property. Staining, also known as
watermarking, embeds secret behaviour into a model which can later be used to
identify it, while locking aims to make a model unusable unless a secret
trigger is inserted into input images. Unlike existing methods, our algorithms
can be used to stain and lock pre-trained models without requiring fine-tuning
or retraining, and come with provable, computable guarantees bounding their
worst-case false positive rates. The stain and lock are implemented by directly
modifying a small number of the model's weights and have minimal impact on the
(unlocked) model's performance. Locked models are unlocked by inserting a small
`trigger patch' into the corner of the input image. We present experimental
results showing the efficacy of our methods and demonstrating their practical
performance on a variety of computer vision models.

Abstract: Industrial smoke segmentation is critical for air-quality monitoring and
environmental protection but is often hampered by the high cost and scarcity of
pixel-level annotations in real-world settings. We introduce CEDANet, a
human-in-the-loop, class-aware domain adaptation framework that uniquely
integrates weak, citizen-provided video-level labels with adversarial feature
alignment. Specifically, we refine pseudo-labels generated by a source-trained
segmentation model using citizen votes, and employ class-specific domain
discriminators to transfer rich source-domain representations to the industrial
domain. Comprehensive experiments on SMOKE5K and custom IJmond datasets
demonstrate that CEDANet achieves an F1-score of 0.414 and a smoke-class IoU of
0.261 with citizen feedback, vastly outperforming the baseline model, which
scored 0.083 and 0.043 respectively. This represents a five-fold increase in
F1-score and a six-fold increase in smoke-class IoU. Notably, CEDANet with
citizen-constrained pseudo-labels achieves performance comparable to the same
architecture trained on limited 100 fully annotated images with F1-score of
0.418 and IoU of 0.264, demonstrating its ability to reach small-sampled fully
supervised-level accuracy without target-domain annotations. Our research
validates the scalability and cost-efficiency of combining citizen science with
weakly supervised domain adaptation, offering a practical solution for complex,
data-scarce environmental monitoring applications.

Conclusion: ViHallu有效缓解LVLM的幻觉问题，提升视觉语义对齐，为细粒度视觉理解提供支持。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual understanding and multimodal reasoning. However, LVLMs
frequently exhibit hallucination phenomena, manifesting as the generated
textual responses that demonstrate inconsistencies with the provided visual
content. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are predominantly
text-centric, the challenges of visual-semantic alignment significantly limit
their effectiveness, especially when confronted with fine-grained visual
understanding scenarios. To this end, this paper presents ViHallu, a
Vision-Centric Hallucination mitigation framework that enhances visual-semantic
alignment through Visual Variation Image Generation and Visual Instruction
Construction. ViHallu introduces \textbf{\textit{visual variation images}} with
controllable visual alterations while maintaining the overall image structure.
These images, combined with carefully constructed visual instructions, enable
LVLMs to better understand fine-grained visual content through fine-tuning,
allowing models to more precisely capture the correspondence between visual
content and text, thereby enhancing visual-semantic alignment. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ViHallu effectively enhances
models' fine-grained visual understanding while significantly reducing
hallucination tendencies. Furthermore, we release ViHallu-Instruction, a visual
instruction dataset specifically designed for hallucination mitigation and
visual-semantic alignment. Code is available at

Method: 使用多语言数据集Project Vaani，比较了三种对比目标函数：全局平均池化损失、密集最大-平均标记匹配器和简单混合方法。

Result: 密集目标函数在音频-视觉检索中相对全局池化提升了59%的R@1，并显著降低了平均和中等排名，同时能生成清晰的零样本定位热图。

Conclusion: 密集标记路由不仅适用于高资源英语语料库，在低资源环境中更为关键，尤其是在标注和音频清洁度不足的情况下。

Abstract: Recent dense audio-visual (AV) models achieve impressive retrieval and
emergent localization, but almost all evidence comes from English-centric,
caption-rich web video. It is unclear whether these objectives survive in
low-resource, code-switched, and noisy multilingual settings that typify
developing regions. We show they do**-**and that the choice of aggregation
function becomes even more critical. Using a multilingual subset of Project
Vaani spanning dozens of Indian languages and dialectal variants, we compare
three contrastive objectives: (i) a global mean-pooled loss (CLIP-style), (ii)
a dense max-mean token matcher (DenseAV-style), and (iii) a simple hybrid
(motivated by frozen-vision alignment strategies). The dense objective delivers
a +59% relative R@1 (Audio Visual) improvement over global pooling and
substantially lower mean/median ranks, while consistently producing sharp
zero-shot localization heatmaps of spoken objects-despite keeping the vision
backbone entirely frozen (no LoRA / partial fine-tuning). Our results
demonstrate that dense token routing is not a luxury of high-resource English
corpora; it is more decisive when annotations and acoustic cleanliness are
scarce. We release the codebase and trained models.

Abstract: We propose a novel segmentation-based explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) method for neural networks working on point cloud classification. As one
building block of this method, we propose a novel point-shifting mechanism to
introduce perturbations in point cloud data. Recently, AI has seen an
exponential growth. Hence, it is important to understand the decision-making
process of AI algorithms when they are applied in critical areas. Our work
focuses on explaining AI algorithms that classify point cloud data. An
important aspect of the methods used for explaining AI algorithms is their
ability to produce explanations that are easy for humans to understand. This
allows them to analyze the AI algorithms better and make appropriate decisions
based on that analysis. Therefore, in this work, we intend to generate
meaningful explanations that can be easily interpreted by humans. The point
cloud data we consider represents 3D objects such as cars, guitars, and
laptops. We make use of point cloud segmentation models to generate
explanations for the working of classification models. The segments are used to
introduce perturbations into the input point cloud data and generate saliency
maps. The perturbations are introduced using the novel point-shifting mechanism
proposed in this work which ensures that the shifted points no longer influence
the output of the classification algorithm. In contrast to previous methods,
the segments used by our method are meaningful, i.e. humans can easily
interpret the meaning of the segments. Thus, the benefit of our method over
other methods is its ability to produce more meaningful saliency maps. We
compare our method with the use of classical clustering algorithms to generate
explanations. We also analyze the saliency maps generated for example inputs
using our method to demonstrate the usefulness of the method in generating
meaningful explanations.

Motivation: 现有导航基础模型仅依赖离线数据训练，缺乏对动作后果的推理能力，难以适应真实世界中的交互需求。

Result: 实验表明S2E解决了离线数据扩展的收益递减问题，并建立了NavBench-GS评估基准。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合在线交互经验对扩展机器人学习的基础模型至关重要。

Abstract: Navigation foundation models trained on massive webscale data enable agents
to generalize across diverse environments and embodiments. However, these
models trained solely on offline data, often lack the capacity to reason about
the consequences of their actions or adapt through counterfactual
understanding. They thus face significant limitations in the real-world urban
navigation where interactive and safe behaviors, such as avoiding obstacles and
moving pedestrians, are critical. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the
Seeing-to-Experiencing framework to scale the capability of navigation
foundation models with reinforcement learning. S2E combines the strengths of
pre-training on videos and post-training through RL. It maintains the
generalizability acquired from large-scale real-world videos while enhancing
its interactivity through RL in simulation environments. Specifically, we
introduce two innovations: an Anchor-Guided Distribution Matching strategy,
which stabilizes learning and models diverse motion patterns through
anchor-based supervision; and a Residual-Attention Module, which obtains
reactive behaviors from simulation environments without erasing the model's
pretrained knowledge. Moreover, we establish a comprehensive end-to-end
evaluation benchmark, NavBench-GS, built on photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions
of real-world scenes that incorporate physical interactions. It can
systematically assess the generalizability and safety of navigation foundation
models. Extensive experiments show that S2E mitigates the diminishing returns
often seen when scaling with offline data alone. We perform a thorough analysis
of the benefits of Reinforcement Learning compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning in
the context of post-training for robot learning. Our findings emphasize the
crucial role of integrating interactive online experiences to effectively scale
foundation models in Robotics.

Conclusion: 浅层网络通过创新的位置感知和特征聚类技术，可以在少样本学习中实现高性能，验证了研究假设。

Abstract: Deep learning has witnessed the extensive utilization across a wide spectrum
of domains, including fine-grained few-shot learning (FGFSL) which heavily
depends on deep backbones. Nonetheless, shallower deep backbones such as
ConvNet-4, are not commonly preferred because they're prone to extract a larger
quantity of non-abstract visual attributes. In this paper, we initially
re-evaluate the relationship between network depth and the ability to fully
encode few-shot instances, and delve into whether shallow deep architecture
could effectuate comparable or superior performance to mainstream deep
backbone. Fueled by the inspiration from vanilla ConvNet-4, we introduce a
location-aware constellation network (LCN-4), equipped with a cutting-edge
location-aware feature clustering module. This module can proficiently encoder
and integrate spatial feature fusion, feature clustering, and recessive feature
location, thereby significantly minimizing the overall loss. Specifically, we
innovatively put forward a general grid position encoding compensation to
effectively address the issue of positional information missing during the
feature extraction process of specific ordinary convolutions. Additionally, we
further propose a general frequency domain location embedding technique to
offset for the location loss in clustering features. We have carried out
validation procedures on three representative fine-grained few-shot benchmarks.
Relevant experiments have established that LCN-4 notably outperforms the
ConvNet-4 based State-of-the-Arts and achieves performance that is on par with
or superior to most ResNet12-based methods, confirming the correctness of our
conjecture.

system features two key components: CLIP3R, a CLIP-informed 3D reconstruction
module that predicts dense point maps from overlapping clips while embedding
object-level semantics; and 2D-3D OVS, a 2D-3D open-vocabulary semantic module
that lifts 2D features into 3D by learning fused descriptors integrating
spatial, geometric, and semantic cues. Unlike prior methods, Ov3R incorporates
CLIP semantics directly into the reconstruction process, enabling globally
consistent geometry and fine-grained semantic alignment. Our framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both dense 3D reconstruction and
open-vocabulary 3D segmentation, marking a step forward toward real-time,

Conclusion: MetaLab在小样本图像识别中表现出高精度、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Difficult few-shot image recognition has significant application prospects,
yet remaining the substantial technical gaps with the conventional large-scale
image recognition. In this paper, we have proposed an efficient original method
for few-shot image recognition, called CIELab-Guided Coherent Meta-Learning
(MetaLab). Structurally, our MetaLab comprises two collaborative neural
networks: LabNet, which can perform domain transformation for the CIELab color
space and extract rich grouped features, and coherent LabGNN, which can
facilitate mutual learning between lightness graph and color graph. For
sufficient certification, we have implemented extensive comparative studies on
four coarse-grained benchmarks, four fine-grained benchmarks, and four
cross-domain few-shot benchmarks. Specifically, our method can achieve high
accuracy, robust performance, and effective generalization capability with
one-shot sample per class. Overall, all experiments have demonstrated that our
MetaLab can approach 99\% $\uparrow\downarrow$ accuracy, reaching the human
recognition ceiling with little visual deviation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为X-Omni的框架，通过强化学习改进离散自回归建模方法，解决了图像生成中的视觉保真度低和细节渲染问题，实现了图像与语言生成的无缝集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于离散令牌的自回归建模方法在图像生成中存在视觉保真度低、输出扭曲和复杂指令遵循能力差的问题，主要由于自回归推理中的累积误差或离散化过程中的信息损失。

Method: X-Omni框架包括语义图像分词器、统一的自回归模型（用于语言和图像）和离线扩散解码器（用于图像生成），通过强化学习优化生成质量。

Result: X-Omni在图像生成任务中实现了最先进的性能，使用7B语言模型生成具有高美学质量的图像，同时表现出强大的指令遵循和长文本渲染能力。

Conclusion: 强化学习可以有效提升离散自回归建模方法的生成质量，为图像与语言生成的统一建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Numerous efforts have been made to extend the ``next token prediction''
paradigm to visual contents, aiming to create a unified approach for both image
generation and understanding. Nevertheless, attempts to generate images through
autoregressive modeling with discrete tokens have been plagued by issues such
as low visual fidelity, distorted outputs, and failure to adhere to complex
instructions when rendering intricate details. These shortcomings are likely
attributed to cumulative errors during autoregressive inference or information
loss incurred during the discretization process. Probably due to this
challenge, recent research has increasingly shifted toward jointly training
image generation with diffusion objectives and language generation with
autoregressive objectives, moving away from unified modeling approaches. In
this work, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning can effectively mitigate
artifacts and largely enhance the generation quality of a discrete
autoregressive modeling method, thereby enabling seamless integration of image
and language generation. Our framework comprises a semantic image tokenizer, a
unified autoregressive model for both language and images, and an offline
diffusion decoder for image generation, termed X-Omni. X-Omni achieves
state-of-the-art performance in image generation tasks using a 7B language
model, producing images with high aesthetic quality while exhibiting strong
capabilities in following instructions and rendering long texts.

*Nisarg A. Shah,Bardia Safaei,Shameema Sikder,S. Swaroop Vedula,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StepAL是一种针对手术视频步骤识别的主动学习框架，通过全视频选择和熵加权聚类策略，减少标注成本并保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习方法针对图像或短视频设计，不适用于长手术视频的步骤识别，因为需要上下文标注。

Method: StepAL结合伪标签生成步骤感知特征表示和熵加权聚类策略，选择不确定且步骤多样的视频标注。

Result: 在Cataract-1k和Cataract-101数据集上，StepAL优于现有方法，以更少标注视频实现更高识别准确率。

Conclusion: StepAL为手术视频分析提供高效标注方案，降低开发计算机辅助手术系统的标注负担。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) can reduce annotation costs in surgical video analysis
while maintaining model performance. However, traditional AL methods, developed
for images or short video clips, are suboptimal for surgical step recognition
due to inter-step dependencies within long, untrimmed surgical videos. These
methods typically select individual frames or clips for labeling, which is
ineffective for surgical videos where annotators require the context of the
entire video for annotation. To address this, we propose StepAL, an active
learning framework designed for full video selection in surgical step
recognition. StepAL integrates a step-aware feature representation, which
leverages pseudo-labels to capture the distribution of predicted steps within
each video, with an entropy-weighted clustering strategy. This combination
prioritizes videos that are both uncertain and exhibit diverse step
compositions for annotation. Experiments on two cataract surgery datasets
(Cataract-1k and Cataract-101) demonstrate that StepAL consistently outperforms
existing active learning approaches, achieving higher accuracy in step
recognition with fewer labeled videos. StepAL offers an effective approach for
efficient surgical video analysis, reducing the annotation burden in developing
computer-assisted surgical systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于运动引导的少样本视频对象分割（FSVOS）方法，并引入了一个新数据集MOVE，用于解决现有方法在动态对象分割中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FSVOS方法主要关注静态对象类别，忽略了视频中的动态运动模式，限制了其在需要运动理解的场景中的应用。

Method: 作者提出了一个基线方法Decoupled Motion Appearance Network (DMA)，并在新数据集MOVE上评估了6种现有方法。

Result: 实验表明，现有方法在运动引导FSVOS任务中表现不佳，而DMA方法在少样本运动理解中取得了优越性能。

Conclusion: 本文为运动引导FSVOS研究奠定了基础，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: This work addresses motion-guided few-shot video object segmentation (FSVOS),
which aims to segment dynamic objects in videos based on a few annotated
examples with the same motion patterns. Existing FSVOS datasets and methods
typically focus on object categories, which are static attributes that ignore
the rich temporal dynamics in videos, limiting their application in scenarios
requiring motion understanding. To fill this gap, we introduce MOVE, a
large-scale dataset specifically designed for motion-guided FSVOS. Based on
MOVE, we comprehensively evaluate 6 state-of-the-art methods from 3 different
related tasks across 2 experimental settings. Our results reveal that current
methods struggle to address motion-guided FSVOS, prompting us to analyze the
associated challenges and propose a baseline method, Decoupled Motion
Appearance Network (DMA). Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior performance in few shot motion understanding, establishing a solid
foundation for future research in this direction.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种共生认识论框架和SynLang协议，旨在通过透明推理模式和信心评估实现人机协作，提升人类智能并保持伦理责任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统的不透明推理过程阻碍了人类监督和协作潜力，传统可解释AI方法无法实现真正的共生协作。

Method: 引入共生认识论作为人机认知合作的哲学基础，提出SynLang协议，包括TRACE和TRACE_FE机制，结合信心量化和上下文继承。

Result: 通过实际人机对话验证了AI对结构化推理协议的适应能力，实现了透明协作和元认知干预。

Conclusion: SynLang和共生认识论通过双层次透明性，支持快速理解和验证AI决策，增强人类智能并保持伦理责任。

Abstract: Current AI systems rely on opaque reasoning processes that hinder human
oversight and collaborative potential. Conventional explainable AI approaches
offer post-hoc justifications and often fail to establish genuine symbiotic
collaboration. In this paper, the Symbiotic Epistemology is presented as a
philosophical foundation for human-AI cognitive partnerships. Unlike frameworks
that treat AI as a mere tool or replacement, symbiotic epistemology positions
AI as a reasoning partner, fostering calibrated trust by aligning human
confidence with AI reliability through explicit reasoning patterns and
confidence assessments. SynLang (Symbiotic Syntactic Language) is introduced as
a formal protocol for transparent human-AI collaboration. The framework is
empirically validated through actual human-AI dialogues demonstrating AI's
adaptation to structured reasoning protocols and successful metacognitive
intervention. The protocol defines two complementary mechanisms: TRACE for
high-level reasoning patterns and TRACE_FE for detailed factor explanations. It
also integrates confidence quantification, declarative control over AI
behavior, and context inheritance for multi-agent coordination. By structuring
communication and embedding confidence-calibrated transparency, SynLang,
together with symbiotic epistemology, enables AI systems that enhance human
intelligence, preserve human agency, and uphold ethical accountability in
collaborative decision-making. Through dual-level transparency, beginning with
high-level reasoning patterns and progressing to granular explanations, the
protocol facilitates rapid comprehension and supports thorough verification of
AI decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLM）辅助开发Synthea（开源合成健康数据生成器）的新疾病模块，以减少开发时间、降低专业需求、提升数据多样性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过LLM辅助开发Synthea模块，旨在提高效率、降低门槛，并优化合成患者数据的质量。

Method: 提出四种LLM支持方式：生成疾病概况、从概况生成模块、评估现有模块及优化模块，并引入渐进式优化概念。

Result: LLM在模块开发中显示出潜力，但也需人工监督和严格验证。

Conclusion: 未来研究需进一步探索LLM在合成数据生成中的潜力，并解决其局限性。

Abstract: This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to assist in the
development of new disease modules for Synthea, an open-source synthetic health
data generator. Incorporating LLMs into the module development process has the
potential to reduce development time, reduce required expertise, expand model
diversity, and improve the overall quality of synthetic patient data. We
demonstrate four ways that LLMs can support Synthea module creation: generating
a disease profile, generating a disease module from a disease profile,
evaluating an existing Synthea module, and refining an existing module. We
introduce the concept of progressive refinement, which involves iteratively
evaluating the LLM-generated module by checking its syntactic correctness and
clinical accuracy, and then using that information to modify the module. While
the use of LLMs in this context shows promise, we also acknowledge the
challenges and limitations, such as the need for human oversight, the
importance of rigorous testing and validation, and the potential for
inaccuracies in LLM-generated content. The paper concludes with recommendations
for future research and development to fully realize the potential of LLM-aided
synthetic data creation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型（LLMs）的内部工作机制，超越传统任务性能指标，探索模型如何处理信息。

Method: 引入‘认知轮廓’和‘熵衰减曲线’，量化模型在不同上下文长度下的预测不确定性变化，并提出信息增益跨度（IGS）指数。

Result: 发现不同LLMs具有独特且一致的认知轮廓，这些轮廓对模型规模和文本复杂度敏感。

Conclusion: 提供了一种新的、原则性的方法来分析和比较人工智能的内在操作动态。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are now
extensively documented on task-specific benchmarks, yet the internal mechanisms
that produce these results are the subject of intense scientific inquiry. This
paper contributes to this inquiry by moving beyond metrics that measure
\textit{what} models can do, to a methodology that characterizes \textit{how}
they process information. We introduce a novel, task-agnostic approach to probe
these dynamics by creating a quantitative ``Cognitive Profile" for any given
model. This profile is centered on the \textbf{Entropy Decay Curve}, a
visualization that traces how a model's normalized predictive uncertainty
changes as a function of context length. Applying this methodology to several
state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse texts, we uncover unique and consistent
cognitive profiles that are sensitive to both model scale and text complexity.
We also introduce the Information Gain Span (IGS) index to summarize the
desirability of the decay trajectory. This work thus provides a new, principled
lens for analyzing and comparing the intrinsic operational dynamics of
artificial intelligence.

TL;DR: NPO是一个对齐感知的学习框架，通过结构化反馈实现人类参与的决策系统的适应性调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法中将对齐视为静态或事后属性的问题，提出可测量、可监督和可减少的对齐损失。

Method: 引入对齐损失的形式化定义，提出元对齐概念，并通过阈值保真度将其简化为主要对齐。实现包括场景评分、阈值调整、策略验证和结构化反馈的循环。

Result: 在随机反馈下，对齐损失和监控保真度均收敛。实证显示NPO在大规模部署中有显著价值。

Conclusion: NPO提供了一种紧凑、可检查的架构，用于持续对齐监控，连接理论对齐保证与动态环境中的实际可靠性。

Abstract: We present NPO, an alignment-aware learning framework that operationalizes
feedback-driven adaptation in human-in-the-loop decision systems. Unlike prior
approaches that treat alignment as a static or post-hoc property, NPO
introduces a formalization of alignment loss that is measurable, supervisable,
and reducible under structured feedback. In parallel, we propose meta-alignment
as the fidelity of the monitoring process that governs retraining or override
triggers, and show that it is formally reducible to primary alignment via
threshold fidelity. Our implementation spans a scalable operational loop
involving scenario scoring, threshold tuning, policy validation, and structured
feedback ingestion, including "likes", overrides, and abstentions. We provide
formal convergence results under stochastic feedback and show that both
alignment loss and monitoring fidelity converge additively. Empirically, NPO
demonstrates measurable value in hyperscale deployment settings. A
simulation-based artifact and ablation studies further illustrate the
theoretical principles in action. Together, NPO offers a compact, inspectable
architecture for continual alignment monitoring, helping bridge theoretical
alignment guarantees with practical reliability in dynamic environments.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在提供高风险生活建议时的失败模式，包括奉承和过度自信，并通过实验展示了模型的安全性和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs被用于高风险生活建议时缺乏标准保障措施，可能导致误导性回答，因此需要研究其失败模式和改进方法。

Method: 通过三个实验：(1) 多选题评估模型对用户压力的稳定性；(2) 自由回答分析，使用新型安全分类法和LLM法官；(3) 机制可解释性实验，通过操纵“高风险”激活向量调整模型行为。

Result: 部分模型表现出奉承行为，但如o4-mini等模型表现稳健；表现最佳的模型通过频繁提问而非直接建议实现高安全性；激活向量操控可直接控制模型的谨慎性。

Conclusion: 需要多方面的基准测试以确保LLMs在重大决策中的可信度，激活向量操控为安全对齐提供了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly consulted for high-stakes life
advice, yet they lack standard safeguards against providing confident but
misguided responses. This creates risks of sycophancy and over-confidence. This
paper investigates these failure modes through three experiments: (1) a
multiple-choice evaluation to measure model stability against user pressure;
(2) a free-response analysis using a novel safety typology and an LLM Judge;
and (3) a mechanistic interpretability experiment to steer model behavior by
manipulating a "high-stakes" activation vector. Our results show that while
some models exhibit sycophancy, others like o4-mini remain robust.
Top-performing models achieve high safety scores by frequently asking
clarifying questions, a key feature of a safe, inquisitive approach, rather
than issuing prescriptive advice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a model's
cautiousness can be directly controlled via activation steering, suggesting a
new path for safety alignment. These findings underscore the need for nuanced,
multi-faceted benchmarks to ensure LLMs can be trusted with life-changing
decisions.

Conclusion: 提出的指标和评级系统能有效统一不同网站的数独难度分类。

Abstract: In this paper we try to answer the question "What constitutes Sudoku
difficulty rating across different Sudoku websites?" Using two distinct methods
that can both solve every Sudoku puzzle, I propose two new metrics to
characterize Sudoku difficulty. The first method is based on converting a
Sudoku puzzle into its corresponding Satisfiability (SAT) problem. The first
proposed metric is derived from SAT Clause Length Distribution which captures
the structural complexity of a Sudoku puzzle including the number of given
digits and the cells they are in. The second method simulates human Sudoku
solvers by intertwining four popular Sudoku strategies within a backtracking
algorithm called Nishio. The second metric is computed by counting the number
of times Sudoku strategies are applied within the backtracking iterations of a
randomized Nishio. Using these two metrics, I analyze more than a thousand
Sudoku puzzles across five popular websites to characterize every difficulty
level in each website. I evaluate the relationship between the proposed metrics
and website-labeled difficulty levels using Spearman's rank correlation
coefficient, finding strong correlations for 4 out of 5 websites. I construct a
universal rating system using a simple, unsupervised classifier based on the
two proposed metrics. This rating system is capable of classifying both
individual puzzles and entire difficulty levels from the different Sudoku
websites into three categories - Universal Easy, Universal Medium, and
Universal Hard - thereby enabling consistent difficulty mapping across Sudoku
websites. The experimental results show that for 4 out of 5 Sudoku websites,
the universal classification aligns well with website-labeled difficulty
levels. Finally, I present an algorithm that can be used by early Sudoku
practitioners to solve Sudoku puzzles.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的快速发展，理解和可靠地抑制其有害行为的需求日益迫切。

Method: 通过55个有害子概念的线性探测，构建有害子空间，并测试子空间的主导方向引导和消融。

Result: 主导方向引导可以几乎消除有害性，同时对模型效用的影响较小。

Conclusion: 概念子空间为LLM行为提供了可扩展的视角，并为社区提供了审计和强化未来语言模型的实用工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have intensified the need to
understand and reliably curb their harmful behaviours. We introduce a
multidimensional framework for probing and steering harmful content in model
internals. For each of 55 distinct harmfulness subconcepts (e.g., racial hate,
employment scams, weapons), we learn a linear probe, yielding 55 interpretable
directions in activation space. Collectively, these directions span a
harmfulness subspace that we show is strikingly low-rank. We then test ablation
of the entire subspace from model internals, as well as steering and ablation
in the subspace's dominant direction. We find that dominant direction steering
allows for near elimination of harmfulness with a low decrease in utility. Our
findings advance the emerging view that concept subspaces provide a scalable
lens on LLM behaviour and offer practical tools for the community to audit and
harden future generations of language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险场景（如应急响应）中，传统可解释AI（XAI）的静态解释和显式反馈机制不适用，需要一种非侵入式的自适应方法以增强信任。

Method: 利用生理和行为信号（如EEG、ECG和眼动追踪）推断用户状态，构建多目标个性化信任估计模型，动态调整解释内容。

Result: 提出了AXTF框架，支持基于用户状态的解释自适应，为高压力环境中的快速信任提供基础。

Conclusion: AXTF为非侵入式自适应XAI系统的发展奠定了基础，适用于高压力、时间敏感的人机协作场景。

Abstract: Effective human-AI teaming heavily depends on swift trust, particularly in
high-stakes scenarios such as emergency response, where timely and accurate
decision-making is critical. In these time-sensitive and cognitively demanding
settings, adaptive explainability is essential for fostering trust between
human operators and AI systems. However, existing explainable AI (XAI)
approaches typically offer uniform explanations and rely heavily on explicit
feedback mechanisms, which are often impractical in such high-pressure
scenarios. To address this gap, we propose a conceptual framework for adaptive
XAI that operates non-intrusively by responding to users' real-time cognitive
and emotional states through implicit feedback, thereby enhancing swift trust
in high-stakes environments. The proposed adaptive explainability trust
framework (AXTF) leverages physiological and behavioral signals, such as EEG,
ECG, and eye tracking, to infer user states and support explanation adaptation.
At its core is a multi-objective, personalized trust estimation model that maps
workload, stress, and emotion to dynamic trust estimates. These estimates guide
the modulation of explanation features enabling responsive and personalized
support that promotes swift trust in human-AI collaboration. This conceptual
framework establishes a foundation for developing adaptive, non-intrusive XAI
systems tailored to the rigorous demands of high-pressure, time-sensitive
environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应集群协作方法，通过自多样性和跨一致性最大化机制提升LLMs在医疗决策支持中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs协作方法缺乏明确的组件选择规则，依赖预定义集群，部分LLMs在医疗场景中表现不佳。

Method: 通过计算LLM的自多样性值和跨一致性值，优先选择高多样性LLMs并逐步剔除低一致性LLMs。

Result: 在NEJMQA和MMLU-Pro-health数据集上表现优异，例如在NEJMQA上达到官方及格分数，优于GPT-4。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了LLMs在医疗决策支持中的协作效果和准确性。

Abstract: The collaborativeness of large language models (LLMs) has proven effective in
natural language processing systems, holding considerable promise for
healthcare development. However, it lacks explicit component selection rules,
necessitating human intervention or clinical-specific validation. Moreover,
existing architectures heavily rely on a predefined LLM cluster, where partial
LLMs underperform in medical decision support scenarios, invalidating the
collaborativeness of LLMs. To this end, we propose an adaptive cluster
collaborativeness methodology involving self-diversity and cross-consistency
maximization mechanisms to boost LLMs medical decision support capacity. For
the self-diversity, we calculate the fuzzy matching value of pairwise outputs
within an LLM as its self-diversity value, subsequently prioritizing LLMs with
high self-diversity values as cluster components in a training-free manner. For
the cross-consistency, we first measure cross-consistency values between the
LLM with the highest self-diversity value and others, and then gradually mask
out the LLM having the lowest cross-consistency value to eliminate the
potential inconsistent output during the collaborative propagation. Extensive
experiments on two specialized medical datasets, NEJMQA and MMLU-Pro-health,
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across physician-oriented
specialties. For example, on NEJMQA, our method achieves the accuracy rate up
to the publicly official passing score across all disciplines, especially
achieving ACC of 65.47\% compared to the 56.12\% achieved by GPT-4 on the
Obstetrics and Gynecology discipline.

Conclusion: 该方法通过自然语言接口简化了ADN调度，降低了技术门槛，提高了效率。

Abstract: The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources into active
distribution networks (ADNs) has made effective ADN dispatch imperative.
However, the numerous newly-integrated ADN operators, such as distribution
system aggregators, virtual power plant managers, and end prosumers, often lack
specialized expertise in power system operation, modeling, optimization, and
programming. This knowledge gap renders reliance on human experts both costly
and time-intensive. To address this challenge and enable intelligent, flexible
ADN dispatch, this paper proposes a large language model (LLM) powered
automated modeling and optimization approach. First, the ADN dispatch problems
are decomposed into sequential stages, and a multi-LLM coordination
architecture is designed. This framework comprises an Information Extractor, a
Problem Formulator, and a Code Programmer, tasked with information retrieval,
optimization problem formulation, and code implementation, respectively.
Afterwards, tailored refinement techniques are developed for each LLM agent,
greatly improving the accuracy and reliability of generated content. The
proposed approach features a user-centric interface that enables ADN operators
to derive dispatch strategies via simple natural language queries, eliminating
technical barriers and increasing efficiency. Comprehensive comparisons and
end-to-end demonstrations on various test cases validate the effectiveness of
the proposed architecture and methods.

Conclusion: 论文为风险的本体论分析提供了新视角，并指出未来可研究其必要条件。

Abstract: The paper explores the nature of risk, providing a characterization using the
categories of the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). It argues that the category Risk
is a subclass of BFO:Role, contrasting it with a similar view classifying Risk
as a subclass of BFO:Disposition. This modeling choice is applied on one
example of risk, which represents objects, processes (both physical and mental)
and their interrelations, then generalizing from the instances in the example
to obtain an overall analysis of risk, making explicit what are the sufficient
conditions for being a risk. Plausible necessary conditions are also mentioned
for future work. Index Terms: ontology, risk, BFO, role, disposition

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合知识图谱和辅助LLM的新框架，用于系统揭示医学LLM中的复杂偏见模式，并通过实验验证其优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学LLM在应用中存在偏见和不公平模式，需在临床决策前识别并缓解其影响。

Method: 结合知识图谱和辅助LLM，采用对抗扰动技术和多跳表征，系统评估LLM的偏见模式。

Result: 在三个数据集、六个LLM和五种偏见类型上的实验表明，该框架在揭示复杂偏见模式方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能更有效地识别医学LLM中的偏见，具有较高的可扩展性和能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) that are used in medical applications are known
to show biased and unfair patterns. Prior to adopting these in clinical
decision-making applications, it is crucial to identify these bias patterns to
enable effective mitigation of their impact. In this study, we present a novel
framework combining knowledge graphs (KGs) with auxiliary LLMs to
systematically reveal complex bias patterns in medical LLMs. Specifically, the
proposed approach integrates adversarial perturbation techniques to identify
subtle bias patterns. The approach adopts a customized multi-hop
characterization of KGs to enhance the systematic evaluation of arbitrary LLMs.
Through a series of comprehensive experiments (on three datasets, six LLMs, and
five bias types), we show that our proposed framework has noticeably greater
ability and scalability to reveal complex biased patterns of LLMs compared to
other baselines.

Abstract: The emergence of AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) marks a
pivotal shift toward the Agentic Web, a new phase of the internet defined by
autonomous, goal-driven interactions. In this paradigm, agents interact
directly with one another to plan, coordinate, and execute complex tasks on
behalf of users. This transition from human-driven to machine-to-machine
interaction allows intent to be delegated, relieving users from routine digital
operations and enabling a more interactive, automated web experience. In this
paper, we present a structured framework for understanding and building the
Agentic Web. We trace its evolution from the PC and Mobile Web eras and
identify the core technological foundations that support this shift. Central to
our framework is a conceptual model consisting of three key dimensions:
intelligence, interaction, and economics. These dimensions collectively enable
the capabilities of AI agents, such as retrieval, recommendation, planning, and
collaboration. We analyze the architectural and infrastructural challenges
involved in creating scalable agentic systems, including communication
protocols, orchestration strategies, and emerging paradigms such as the Agent
Attention Economy. We conclude by discussing the potential applications,
societal risks, and governance issues posed by agentic systems, and outline
research directions for developing open, secure, and intelligent ecosystems
shaped by both human intent and autonomous agent behavior. A continuously

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）在组合性语言解释中的能力，发现其在复杂问题解释和SPARQL查询映射方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM在语言解释过程中是否具有系统性组合能力，尤其是将复杂问题映射为SPARQL查询的能力。

Method: 基于DBpedia的图模式生成三个难度不同的数据集，使用Lemon lexica进行语言化，通过不同提示和优化技术（如few-shot和微调）测试LLM的表现。

Result: 实验显示，随着问题与训练样本的偏离增加，性能显著下降（F1从0.45降至0.09），即使输入包含所有必要信息，最高F1仅为0.57。

Conclusion: LLM在系统性和组合性解释复杂问题并映射为SPARQL查询方面存在困难。

Abstract: Language interpretation is a compositional process, in which the meaning of
more complex linguistic structures is inferred from the meaning of their parts.
Large language models possess remarkable language interpretation capabilities
and have been successfully applied to interpret questions by mapping them to
SPARQL queries. An open question is how systematic this interpretation process
is. Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for
investigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are
actually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying
difficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for
verbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order
to test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given
that they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate to
what degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they
"understand" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of different
sizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as
fine-tuning. Our results show that performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degrades
from $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from the
samples optimized on. Even when all necessary information was provided to the
model in the input, the $F_1$ scores do not exceed $0.57$ for the dataset of
lowest complexity. We thus conclude that LLMs struggle to systematically and
compositionally interpret questions and map them into SPARQL queries.

TL;DR: LeMix系统通过共同调度LLM的推理和训练任务，显著提高了资源利用率和响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将LLM的推理和训练任务分离部署，导致资源浪费和延迟适应新数据。

Method: LeMix结合离线分析、执行预测和运行时调度，动态分配资源。

Result: LeMix将吞吐量提升3.53倍，推理损失降低0.61倍，响应时间SLO达成率提高2.12倍。

Conclusion: LeMix首次实现LLM推理与训练的共同调度，为高效部署LLM提供了新方向。

Abstract: Modern deployment of large language models (LLMs) frequently involves both
inference serving and continuous retraining to stay aligned with evolving data
and user feedback. Common practices separate these workloads onto distinct
servers in isolated phases, causing substantial inefficiencies (e.g., GPU
idleness) and delayed adaptation to new data in distributed settings. Our
empirical analysis reveals that these inefficiencies stem from dynamic request
arrivals during serving and workload heterogeneity in pipeline-parallel
training. To address these challenges, we propose LeMix, a system for
co-locating and managing concurrent LLM serving and training workloads. LeMix
integrates offline profiling, execution prediction mechanisms, and runtime
scheduling to dynamically adapt resource allocation based on workload
characteristics and system conditions. By understanding task-specific behaviors
and co-execution interference across shared nodes, LeMix improves utilization
and serving quality without compromising serving responsiveness. Our evaluation
shows that LeMix improves throughput by up to 3.53x, reduces inference loss by
up to 0.61x, and delivers up to 2.12x higher response time SLO attainment over
traditional separate setups. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
uncover and exploit the opportunities of joint LLM inference and training,
paving the way for more resource-efficient deployment of LLMs in production
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在代码生成中因开发者提示模糊而表现不佳，需通过提示工程或外部上下文推断用户意图。

Method: 构建了一个端到端系统，包括查询分类器和微调LLM，用于检测模糊查询并生成澄清问题。

Result: 微调LLM在生成有用澄清问题上优于零样本提示，用户研究显示其生成的代码更准确有帮助。

Conclusion: 该代码助手通过生成澄清问题显著提升了代码生成的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as coding assistants.
However, the ambiguity of the developer's prompt often leads to incorrect code
generation, as current models struggle to infer user intent without extensive
prompt engineering or external context. This work aims to build an LLM-based
coding assistant that mimics the human code review process by asking
clarification questions when faced with ambiguous or under-specified queries.
  Our end-to-end system includes (1) a query classifier trained to detect
unclear programming-related queries and (2) a fine-tuned LLM that generates
clarification questions. Our evaluation shows that the fine-tuned LLM
outperforms standard zero-shot prompting in generating useful clarification
questions. Furthermore, our user study indicates that users find the
clarification questions generated by our model to outperform the baseline,
demonstrating that our coding assistant produces more accurate and helpful code
responses compared to baseline coding assistants.

Method: 采用多维评分系统，结合语义匹配和来源可靠性，利用嵌入相关性评分和混合质量文档的合成训练数据。

Result: 初步评估显示幻觉率显著降低，推理过程透明度提高。

Conclusion: 该框架为动态环境中高效运行的可靠问答系统开发提供了重要进展，但仍需解决信息可信度区分和系统延迟平衡问题。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) face significant challenges in
reducing factual errors, particularly in document relevance evaluation and
knowledge integration. We introduce a framework for structured relevance
assessment that enhances RALM robustness through improved document evaluation,
balanced intrinsic and external knowledge integration, and effective handling
of unanswerable queries. Our approach employs a multi-dimensional scoring
system that considers both semantic matching and source reliability, utilizing
embedding-based relevance scoring and synthetic training data with
mixed-quality documents. We implement specialized benchmarking on niche topics,
a knowledge integration mechanism, and an "unknown" response protocol for
queries with insufficient knowledge coverage. Preliminary evaluations
demonstrate significant reductions in hallucination rates and improved
transparency in reasoning processes. Our framework advances the development of
more reliable question-answering systems capable of operating effectively in
dynamic environments with variable data quality. While challenges persist in
accurately distinguishing credible information and balancing system latency
with thoroughness, this work represents a meaningful step toward enhancing RALM
reliability.

Result: 实验模拟显示，基于TA的智能体能够产生更深入且情境感知的交互。

Conclusion: Trans-ACT为冲突解决、教育支持和心理学研究开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are increasingly used to simulate social
interactions, but most of the frameworks miss the underlying cognitive
complexity of human behavior. In this paper, we introduce Trans-ACT
(Transactional Analysis Cognitive Toolkit), an approach embedding Transactional
Analysis (TA) principles into MAS to generate agents with realistic
psychological dynamics. Trans-ACT integrates the Parent, Adult, and Child ego
states into an agent's cognitive architecture. Each ego state retrieves
context-specific memories and uses them to shape response to new situations.
The final answer is chosen according to the underlying life script of the
agent. Our experimental simulation, which reproduces the Stupid game scenario,
demonstrates that agents grounded in cognitive and TA principles produce deeper
and context-aware interactions. Looking ahead, our research opens a new way for
a variety of applications, including conflict resolution, educational support,
and advanced social psychology studies.

Conclusion: 交互式AI工具显著提升复杂标注任务的效率和准确性，标注者技能是关键因素。

Abstract: We utilize a within-subjects design with randomized task assignments to
understand the effectiveness of using an AI retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) tool to assist analysts with an information extraction and data
annotation task. We replicate an existing, challenging real-world annotation
task with complex multi-part criteria on a set of thousands of pages of public
disclosure documents from global systemically important banks (GSIBs) with
heterogeneous and incomplete information content. We test two treatment
conditions. First, a "naive" AI use condition in which annotators use only the
tool and must accept the first answer they are given. And second, an
"interactive" AI treatment condition where annotators use the tool
interactively, and use their judgement to follow-up with additional information
if necessary. Compared to the human-only baseline, the use of the AI tool
accelerated task execution by up to a factor of 10 and enhanced task accuracy,
particularly in the interactive condition. We find that when extrapolated to
the full task, these methods could save up to 268 hours compared to the
human-only approach. Additionally, our findings suggest that annotator skill,
not just with the subject matter domain, but also with AI tools, is a factor in
both the accuracy and speed of task performance.

Conclusion: 该研究填补了现有方法的空白，为动态高效的供应链管理提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Supply chain management faces significant challenges, including demand
fluctuations, inventory imbalances, and amplified upstream order variability
due to the bullwhip effect. Traditional methods, such as simple moving
averages, struggle to address dynamic market conditions. Emerging machine
learning techniques, including LSTM, reinforcement learning, and XGBoost, offer
potential solutions but are limited by computational complexity, training
inefficiencies, or constraints in time-series modeling. Liquid Neural Networks,
inspired by dynamic biological systems, present a promising alternative due to
their adaptability, low computational cost, and robustness to noise, making
them suitable for real-time decision-making and edge computing. Despite their
success in applications like autonomous vehicles and medical monitoring, their
potential in supply chain optimization remains underexplored. This study
introduces a hybrid LNN and XGBoost model to optimize ordering strategies in
multi-tier supply chains. By leveraging LNN's dynamic feature extraction and
XGBoost's global optimization capabilities, the model aims to mitigate the
bullwhip effect and enhance cumulative profitability. The research investigates
how local and global synergies within the hybrid framework address the dual
demands of adaptability and efficiency in SCM. The proposed approach fills a
critical gap in existing methodologies, offering an innovative solution for
dynamic and efficient supply chain management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在面对不完整或模糊提示时表现被动，无法主动收集关键信息，限制了其作为协作伙伴的能力。

Method: 设计了可扩展的框架生成部分指定的任务，采用强化微调策略奖励能获取隐含信息的提问。

Result: Qwen-2.5-7B模型在自动评估中优于基线18%，人工评估中其提问和最终方案分别获得42%和28%的偏好。

Conclusion: 主动澄清能显著提升LLMs的协作能力，使其从被动文本生成器转变为真正的协作伙伴。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to function as
collaborative partners, engaging in back-and-forth dialogue to solve complex,
ambiguous problems. However, current LLMs often falter in real-world settings,
defaulting to passive responses or narrow clarifications when faced with
incomplete or under-specified prompts, falling short of proactively gathering
the missing information that is crucial for high-quality solutions. In this
work, we introduce a new task paradigm: proactive information gathering, where
LLMs must identify gaps in the provided context and strategically elicit
implicit user knowledge through targeted questions. To systematically study and
train this capability, we design a scalable framework that generates partially
specified, real-world tasks, masking key information and simulating authentic
ambiguity. Within this setup, our core innovation is a reinforcement finetuning
strategy that rewards questions that elicit genuinely new, implicit user
information -- such as hidden domain expertise or fine-grained requirements --
that would otherwise remain unspoken. Experiments demonstrate that our trained
Qwen-2.5-7B model significantly outperforms o3-mini by 18% on automatic
evaluation metrics. More importantly, human evaluation reveals that
clarification questions and final outlines generated by our model are favored
by human annotators by 42% and 28% respectively. Together, these results
highlight the value of proactive clarification in elevating LLMs from passive
text generators to genuinely collaborative thought partners.

Motivation: 在问答任务中，确定何时信任大语言模型的输出至关重要。现有方法（如语义熵）通过设定阈值衡量语义等价关系，但缺乏对语义关系连续性的捕捉。

Method: 提出了一种基于Shapley的不确定性度量框架，扩展了现有方法，并定义了三个基本性质来验证其有效性。

Result: 实验表明，Shapley不确定性比基线方法更准确地预测了大语言模型在问答和其他数据集中的表现。

Conclusion: Shapley不确定性提供了一种更精细的语义关系度量方法，优于现有阈值方法。

Abstract: In question-answering tasks, determining when to trust the outputs is crucial
to the alignment of large language models (LLMs). Kuhn et al. (2023) introduces
semantic entropy as a measure of uncertainty, by incorporating linguistic
invariances from the same meaning. It primarily relies on setting threshold to
measure the level of semantic equivalence relation. We propose a more nuanced
framework that extends beyond such thresholding by developing a Shapley-based
uncertainty metric that captures the continuous nature of semantic
relationships. We establish three fundamental properties that characterize
valid uncertainty metrics and prove that our Shapley uncertainty satisfies
these criteria. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our Shapley
uncertainty more accurately predicts LLM performance in question-answering and
other datasets, compared to similar baseline measures.

Conclusion: 论文提出了未来研究方向，包括提升结构适应性、实现统一和可扩展的GLA系统，旨在为GLA研究提供路线图。

Abstract: Autonomous agents based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities in a wide range of applications, including web
navigation, software development, and embodied control. While most LLMs are
limited in several key agentic procedures, such as reliable planning, long-term
memory, tool management, and multi-agent coordination, graphs can serve as a
powerful auxiliary structure to enhance structure, continuity, and coordination
in complex agent workflows. Given the rapid growth and fragmentation of
research on Graph-augmented LLM Agents (GLA), this paper offers a timely and
comprehensive overview of recent advances and also highlights key directions
for future work. Specifically, we categorize existing GLA methods by their
primary functions in LLM agent systems, including planning, memory, and tool
usage, and then analyze how graphs and graph learning algorithms contribute to
each. For multi-agent systems, we further discuss how GLA solutions facilitate
the orchestration, efficiency optimization, and trustworthiness of MAS.
Finally, we highlight key future directions to advance this field, from
improving structural adaptability to enabling unified, scalable, and multimodal
GLA systems. We hope this paper can serve as a roadmap for future research on
GLA and foster a deeper understanding of the role of graphs in LLM agent
systems.

Abstract: Ontologies and knowledge graphs require continuous evolution to remain
comprehensive and accurate, but manual curation is labor intensive. Large
Language Models (LLMs) possess vast unstructured knowledge but struggle with
maintaining structured consistency. We propose Evo-DKD, a novel dual-decoder
framework for autonomous ontology evolution that combines structured ontology
traversal with unstructured text reasoning. Evo-DKD introduces two parallel
decoding streams within an LLM: one decoder generates candidate ontology edits
(e.g., new concepts or relations) while the other produces natural-language
justifications. A dynamic attention-based gating mechanism coordinates the two
streams, deciding at each step how to blend structured and unstructured
knowledge. Due to GPU constraints, we simulate the dual-decoder behavior using
prompt-based mode control to approximate coordinated decoding in a
single-stream mode. The system operates in a closed reasoning loop: proposed
ontology edits are validated (via consistency checks and cross-verification
with the text explanations) and then injected into the knowledge base, which in
turn informs subsequent reasoning. We demonstrate Evo-DKD's effectiveness on
use cases including healthcare ontology refinement, semantic search
improvement, and cultural heritage timeline modeling. Experiments show that
Evo-DKD outperforms baselines using structured-only or unstructured-only
decoding in both precision of ontology updates and downstream task performance.
We present quantitative metrics and qualitative examples, confirming the
contributions of the dual-decoder design and gating router. Evo-DKD offers a
new paradigm for LLM-driven knowledge base maintenance, combining the strengths
of symbolic and neural reasoning for sustainable ontology evolution.

Result: Sherpa Rx在准确性（4.9）、相关性（5.0）、清晰度（5.0）、完整性（4.8）和召回率（0.99）上表现优异。第二阶段在准确性和完整性上有所提升，显著优于ChatGPT-4omini。

Conclusion: 整合CPIC和PharmGKB数据的RAG方法显著提升了AI性能，Sherpa Rx在药物基因组学中具有变革潜力，能提供更准确的个性化决策支持。

Abstract: This study evaluated Sherpa Rx, an artificial intelligence tool leveraging
large language models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for
pharmacogenomics, to validate its performance on key response metrics. Sherpa
Rx integrated Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC)
guidelines with Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) data to generate
contextually relevant responses. A dataset (N=260 queries) spanning 26 CPIC
guidelines was used to evaluate drug-gene interactions, dosing recommendations,
and therapeutic implications. In Phase 1, only CPIC data was embedded. Phase 2
additionally incorporated PharmGKB content. Responses were scored on accuracy,
relevance, clarity, completeness (5-point Likert scale), and recall. Wilcoxon
signed-rank tests compared accuracy between Phase 1 and Phase 2, and between
Phase 2 and ChatGPT-4omini. A 20-question quiz assessed the tool's real-world
applicability against other models. In Phase 1 (N=260), Sherpa Rx demonstrated
high performance of accuracy 4.9, relevance 5.0, clarity 5.0, completeness 4.8,
and recall 0.99. The subset analysis (N=20) showed improvements in accuracy
(4.6 vs. 4.4, Phase 2 vs. Phase 1 subset) and completeness (5.0 vs. 4.8).
ChatGPT-4omini performed comparably in relevance (5.0) and clarity (4.9) but
lagged in accuracy (3.9) and completeness (4.2). Differences in accuracy
between Phase 1 and Phase 2 was not statistically significant. However, Phase 2
significantly outperformed ChatGPT-4omini. On the 20-question quiz, Sherpa Rx
achieved 90% accuracy, outperforming other models. Integrating additional
resources like CPIC and PharmGKB with RAG enhances AI accuracy and performance.
This study highlights the transformative potential of generative AI like Sherpa
Rx in pharmacogenomics, improving decision-making with accurate, personalized
responses.

Motivation: 红外光谱分析面临高维重叠谱带的挑战，传统方法难以应对低数据条件。大语言模型的泛化和推理能力为自动化科学工作流程提供了潜力。

Method: 提出端到端的LLM驱动框架，整合文献知识库、光谱预处理、特征提取和多任务推理，通过多轮协议动态优化预测。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的框架在低数据条件下实现了高效的红外光谱分析，展示了其在科学自动化中的潜力。

Abstract: Infrared spectroscopy offers rapid, non destructive measurement of chemical
and material properties but suffers from high dimensional, overlapping spectral
bands that challenge conventional chemometric approaches. Emerging large
language models (LLMs), with their capacity for generalization and reasoning,
offer promising potential for automating complex scientific workflows. Despite
this promise, their application in IR spectral analysis remains largely
unexplored. This study addresses the critical challenge of achieving accurate,
automated infrared spectral interpretation under low-data conditions using an
LLM-driven framework. We introduce an end-to-end, large language model driven
agent framework that integrates a structured literature knowledge base,
automated spectral preprocessing, feature extraction, and multi task reasoning
in a unified pipeline. By querying a curated corpus of peer reviewed IR
publications, the agent selects scientifically validated routines. The selected
methods transform each spectrum into low dimensional feature sets, which are
fed into few shot prompt templates for classification, regression, and anomaly
detection. A closed loop, multi turn protocol iteratively appends mispredicted
samples to the prompt, enabling dynamic refinement of predictions. Across
diverse materials: stamp pad ink, Chinese medicine, Pu'er tea, Citri
Reticulatae Pericarpium and waste water COD datasets, the multi turn LLM
consistently outperforms single turn inference, rivaling or exceeding machine
learning and deep learning models under low data regimes.

Conclusion: Maia4All为个性化AI适应提供了高效框架，并展示了在更广泛应用中的潜力。

Abstract: As humans seek to collaborate with, learn from, and better understand
artificial intelligence systems, developing AIs that can accurately emulate
individual decision-making becomes increasingly important. Chess, a
long-standing AI benchmark with precise skill measurement, offers an ideal
testbed for human-AI alignment. However, existing approaches to modeling human
behavior require prohibitively large amounts of data from each individual,
making them impractical for new or sparsely represented users. In this work, we
introduce Maia4All, a framework designed to learn and adapt to individual
decision-making styles efficiently, even with limited data. Maia4All achieves
this through a two-stage optimization process: (1) an enrichment step, which
bridges population and individual-level human behavior modeling with a
prototype-enriched model, and (2) a democratization step, which leverages
ability levels or user prototypes to initialize and refine individual
embeddings with minimal data. Our experimental results show that Maia4All can
accurately predict individual moves and profile behavioral patterns with high
fidelity, establishing a new standard for personalized human-like AI behavior
modeling in chess. Maia4All achieves individual human behavior modeling in
chess with only 20 games, compared to the 5,000 games required previously,
representing a significant improvement in data efficiency. Our work provides an
example of how population AI systems can flexibly adapt to individual users
using a prototype-enriched model as a bridge. This approach extends beyond
chess, as shown in our case study on idiosyncratic LLMs, highlighting its
potential for broader applications in personalized AI adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统供应链管理工具依赖数据科学团队解释结果或更新模型，决策过程缓慢。LLMs的进步为解决这一问题提供了新途径。

Method: 应用LLMs技术，自动化解释工具结果、分析场景和更新模型，减少人工干预。

Result: 决策时间从数天或数周缩短至数分钟或数小时，显著提升生产力和影响力。

Conclusion: LLMs能有效民主化供应链技术，加速决策并提高效率。

Abstract: Supply Chain Management requires addressing a variety of complex
decision-making challenges, from sourcing strategies to planning and execution.
Over the last few decades, advances in computation and information technologies
have enabled the transition from manual, intuition and experience-based
decision-making, into more automated and data-driven decisions using a variety
of tools that apply optimization techniques. These techniques use mathematical
methods to improve decision-making.
  Unfortunately, business planners and executives still need to spend
considerable time and effort to (i) understand and explain the recommendations
coming out of these technologies; (ii) analyze various scenarios and answer
what-if questions; and (iii) update the mathematical models used in these tools
to reflect current business environments. Addressing these challenges requires
involving data science teams and/or the technology providers to explain results
or make the necessary changes in the technology and hence significantly slows
down decision making.
  Motivated by the recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), we report
how this disruptive technology can democratize supply chain technology -
namely, facilitate the understanding of tools' outcomes, as well as the
interaction with supply chain tools without human-in-the-loop. Specifically, we
report how we apply LLMs to address the three challenges described above, thus
substantially reducing the time to decision from days and weeks to minutes and
hours as well as dramatically increasing planners' and executives' productivity
and impact.

Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在视觉语言任务中取得进展，但其在不可回答问题中的诚实行为尚未充分研究，亟需系统性评估。

Method: 定义了四类视觉不可回答问题，构建了包含12k+样本的MoHoBench基准，并通过多阶段过滤和人工验证确保质量。评估了28种流行MLLMs的诚实行为。

Result: 发现大多数模型无法适当拒绝回答，且诚实行为受视觉信息影响。通过监督和偏好学习初步改进了诚实行为。

Conclusion: MLLMs的诚实行为需专门的多模态对齐方法，未来需进一步研究可信赖的MLLMs。

Abstract: Recently Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved considerable
advancements in vision-language tasks, yet produce potentially harmful or
untrustworthy content. Despite substantial work investigating the
trustworthiness of language models, MMLMs' capability to act honestly,
especially when faced with visually unanswerable questions, remains largely
underexplored. This work presents the first systematic assessment of honesty
behaviors across various MLLMs. We ground honesty in models' response behaviors
to unanswerable visual questions, define four representative types of such
questions, and construct MoHoBench, a large-scale MMLM honest benchmark,
consisting of 12k+ visual question samples, whose quality is guaranteed by
multi-stage filtering and human verification. Using MoHoBench, we benchmarked
the honesty of 28 popular MMLMs and conducted a comprehensive analysis. Our
findings show that: (1) most models fail to appropriately refuse to answer when
necessary, and (2) MMLMs' honesty is not solely a language modeling issue, but
is deeply influenced by visual information, necessitating the development of
dedicated methods for multimodal honesty alignment. Therefore, we implemented
initial alignment methods using supervised and preference learning to improve
honesty behavior, providing a foundation for future work on trustworthy MLLMs.

Conclusion: 为未来研究提供了可操作的定义，并预留了动作效果建模的空间。

Abstract: We propose a set of precise criteria for saying a neural net learns and uses
a "world model." The goal is to give an operational meaning to terms that are
often used informally, in order to provide a common language for experimental
investigation. We focus specifically on the idea of representing a latent
"state space" of the world, leaving modeling the effect of actions to future
work. Our definition is based on ideas from the linear probing literature, and
formalizes the notion of a computation that factors through a representation of
the data generation process. An essential addition to the definition is a set
of conditions to check that such a "world model" is not a trivial consequence
of the neural net's data or task.

Motivation: 群体舞蹈生成在影视、游戏和动画制作中有广泛应用，但现有方法难以处理多舞者的密集时空交互，导致可扩展性问题和碰撞风险。

Method: 采用轻量级图卷积进行距离感知的空间建模，以及加速稀疏注意力机制进行高效的时间建模。

Result: 在AIOZ-GDance数据集上，ST-GDance优于现有基线，尤其在生成长且连贯的群体舞蹈序列方面表现突出。

Conclusion: ST-GDance通过解耦时空依赖，显著降低了计算成本，同时确保了流畅且无碰撞的交互。

Abstract: Group dance generation from music has broad applications in film, gaming, and
animation production. However, it requires synchronizing multiple dancers while
maintaining spatial coordination. As the number of dancers and sequence length
increase, this task faces higher computational complexity and a greater risk of
motion collisions. Existing methods often struggle to model dense
spatial-temporal interactions, leading to scalability issues and multi-dancer
collisions. To address these challenges, we propose ST-GDance, a novel
framework that decouples spatial and temporal dependencies to optimize
long-term and collision-free group choreography. We employ lightweight graph
convolutions for distance-aware spatial modeling and accelerated sparse
attention for efficient temporal modeling. This design significantly reduces
computational costs while ensuring smooth and collision-free interactions.
Experiments on the AIOZ-GDance dataset demonstrate that ST-GDance outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in generating long and coherent group
dance sequences. Project page: https://yilliajing.github.io/ST-GDance-Website/.

Conclusion: 个性化解释方法能更有效地满足用户需求，提升AI的透明度和用户体验。

Abstract: The need for explanations in AI has, by and large, been driven by the desire
to increase the transparency of black-box machine learning models. However,
such explanations, which focus on the internal mechanisms that lead to a
specific output, are often unsuitable for non-experts. To facilitate a
human-centered perspective on AI explanations, agents need to focus on
individuals and their preferences as well as the context in which the
explanations are given. This paper proposes a personalized approach to
explanation, where the agent tailors the information provided to the user based
on what is most likely pertinent to them. We propose a model of the agent's
worldview that also serves as a personal and dynamic memory of its previous
interactions with the same user, based on which the artificial agent can
estimate what part of its knowledge is most likely new information to the user.

Abstract: In this work, we study how vision-language models (VLMs) can be utilized to
enhance the safety for the autonomous driving system, including perception,
situational understanding, and path planning. However, existing research has
largely overlooked the evaluation of these models in traffic safety-critical
driving scenarios. To bridge this gap, we create the benchmark (SafeDrive228K)
and propose a new baseline based on VLM with knowledge graph-based
retrieval-augmented generation (SafeDriveRAG) for visual question answering
(VQA). Specifically, we introduce SafeDrive228K, the first large-scale
multimodal question-answering benchmark comprising 228K examples across 18
sub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses a diverse range of traffic safety
queries, from traffic accidents and corner cases to common safety knowledge,
enabling a thorough assessment of the comprehension and reasoning abilities of
the models. Furthermore, we propose a plug-and-play multimodal knowledge
graph-based retrieval-augmented generation approach that employs a novel
multi-scale subgraph retrieval algorithm for efficient information retrieval.
By incorporating traffic safety guidelines collected from the Internet, this
framework further enhances the model's capacity to handle safety-critical
situations. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on five mainstream
VLMs to assess their reliability in safety-sensitive driving tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that integrating RAG significantly improves
performance, achieving a +4.73% gain in Traffic Accidents tasks, +8.79% in
Corner Cases tasks and +14.57% in Traffic Safety Commonsense across five
mainstream VLMs, underscoring the potential of our proposed benchmark and
methodology for advancing research in traffic safety. Our source code and data

Conclusion: PHP方法通过三阶段设计，有效平衡了知识共享与任务特异性，提升了多任务增量学习的效果。

Abstract: Audio-visual multi-task incremental learning aims to continuously learn from
multiple audio-visual tasks without the need for joint training on all tasks.
The challenge of the problem is how to preserve the old task knowledge while
facilitating the learning of new task with previous experiences. To address
these challenges, we introduce a three-stage Progressive Homeostatic and
Plastic audio-visual prompt (PHP) method. In the shallow phase, we design the
task-shared modality aggregating adapter to foster cross-task and cross-modal
audio-visual representation learning to enhance shared understanding between
tasks. In the middle phase, we propose the task-specific modality-shared
dynamic generating adapter, which constructs prompts that are tailored to
individual tasks while remaining general across modalities, which balances the
models ability to retain knowledge against forgetting with its potential for
versatile multi-task transferability. In the deep phase, we introduce the
task-specific modality-independent prompts to further refine the understand
ability by targeting individual information for each task and modality. By
incorporating these three phases, PHP retains task-specific prompts while
adapting shared parameters for new tasks to effectively balance knowledge
sharing and specificity. Our method achieves SOTA performance in different
orders of four tasks (AVE, AVVP, AVS and AVQA). Our code can be available at

Result: 分析表明贝叶斯推理未在现代具身智能中发挥核心作用，同时揭示当前系统局限于封闭环境。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯方法有望推动具身智能向开放物理世界扩展。

Abstract: Embodied intelligence posits that cognitive capabilities fundamentally emerge
from - and are shaped by - an agent's real-time sensorimotor interactions with
its environment. Such adaptive behavior inherently requires continuous
inference under uncertainty. Bayesian statistics offers a principled
probabilistic framework to address this challenge by representing knowledge as
probability distributions and updating beliefs in response to new evidence. The
core computational processes underlying embodied intelligence - including
perception, action selection, learning, and even higher-level cognition - can
be effectively understood and modeled as forms of Bayesian inference. Despite
the deep conceptual connection between Bayesian statistics and embodied
intelligence, Bayesian principles have not been widely or explicitly applied in
today's embodied intelligence systems. In this work, we examine both Bayesian
and contemporary embodied intelligence approaches through two fundamental
lenses: search and learning - the two central themes in modern AI, as
highlighted in Rich Sutton's influential essay "The Bitter Lesson". This
analysis sheds light on why Bayesian inference has not played a central role in
the development of modern embodied intelligence. At the same time, it reveals
that current embodied intelligence systems remain largely confined to
closed-physical-world environments, and highlights the potential for Bayesian
methods to play a key role in extending these systems toward truly open
physical-world embodied intelligence.

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the notion of legibility in sequential
decision-making in the context of teams and teamwork. There have been works
that extend the notion of legibility to sequential decision making, for
deterministic and for stochastic scenarios. However, these works focus on one
agent interacting with one human, foregoing the benefits of having legible
decision making in teams of agents or in team configurations with humans. In
this work we propose an extension of legible decision-making to multi-agent
settings that improves the performance of agents working in collaboration. We
showcase the performance of legible decision making in team scenarios using our
proposed extension in multi-agent benchmark scenarios. We show that a team with
a legible agent is able to outperform a team composed solely of agents with
standard optimal behaviour.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents integrate pre-trained LLMs with modular
algorithmic components and have shown remarkable reasoning and decision-making
abilities. In this work, we investigate their use for two tightly intertwined
challenges in workforce management: staffing, i.e., the assignment and
scheduling of tasks to workers, which may require team formation; and
profiling, i.e., the continuous estimation of workers' skills, preferences, and
other latent attributes from unstructured data. We cast these problems in a
formal mathematical framework that links scheduling decisions to latent feature
estimation, and we introduce StaffPro, an LLM agent that addresses staffing and
profiling jointly. Differently from existing staffing solutions, StaffPro
allows expressing optimization objectives using natural language, accepts
textual task descriptions and provides high flexibility. StaffPro interacts
directly with humans by establishing a continuous human-agent feedback loop,
ensuring natural and intuitive use. By analyzing human feedback, our agent
continuously estimates the latent features of workers, realizing life-long
worker profiling and ensuring optimal staffing performance over time. A
consulting firm simulation example demonstrates that StaffPro successfully
estimates workers' attributes and generates high quality schedules. With its
innovative design, StaffPro offers a robust, interpretable, and human-centric
solution for automated personnel management.

*Wanying Wang,Zeyu Ma,Han Zheng,Xin Tan,Mingang Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）相比纯语言模型更容易受到有害输入的影响。研究通过分析模型内部动态，定义了三种关键能力（安全感知、语义理解和语言表达对齐），并提出了一种无需微调的技术SASA来增强安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs在安全性上存在脆弱性，研究旨在通过理解其内部动态并提出改进方法来提升安全性。

Method: 定义了三种关键能力并定位其在模型架构中的位置，提出SASA技术，通过将中间层的语义信息投影到早期安全层来增强安全性。

Result: 实验表明SASA显著提升了LVLMs的安全性，且对模型实用性影响极小。

Conclusion: SASA是一种有效的方法，能够在不微调的情况下提升LVLMs的安全性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are vulnerable to harmful input compared
to their language-only backbones. We investigated this vulnerability by
exploring LVLMs internal dynamics, framing their inherent safety understanding
in terms of three key capabilities. Specifically, we define these capabilities
as safety perception, semantic understanding, and alignment for linguistic
expression, and experimentally pinpointed their primary locations within the
model architecture. The results indicate that safety perception often emerges
before comprehensive semantic understanding, leading to the reduction in
safety. Motivated by these findings, we propose \textbf{Self-Aware Safety
Augmentation (SASA)}, a technique that projects informative semantic
representations from intermediate layers onto earlier safety-oriented layers.
This approach leverages the model's inherent semantic understanding to enhance
safety recognition without fine-tuning. Then, we employ linear probing to
articulate the model's internal semantic comprehension to detect the risk
before the generation process. Extensive experiments on various datasets and
tasks demonstrate that SASA significantly improves the safety of LVLMs, with
minimal impact on the utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习基准（如游戏）难以直接应用于现实世界的机器人交互场景，因此需要多样化的基准测试以解决复杂性问题。

Method: 使用JAX硬件加速进行物理模拟，通过多智能体强化学习训练多样化的伙伴智能体，测试机器人的零样本协调能力。

Result: Assistax在训练速度上比CPU方案快370倍，并为连续控制和多智能体强化学习算法提供了可靠的基线。

Conclusion: Assistax是一个实用的基准测试，有助于推动辅助机器人领域的强化学习研究。

Abstract: The development of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms has been largely
driven by ambitious challenge tasks and benchmarks. Games have dominated RL
benchmarks because they present relevant challenges, are inexpensive to run and
easy to understand. While games such as Go and Atari have led to many
breakthroughs, they often do not directly translate to real-world embodied
applications. In recognising the need to diversify RL benchmarks and addressing
complexities that arise in embodied interaction scenarios, we introduce
Assistax: an open-source benchmark designed to address challenges arising in
assistive robotics tasks. Assistax uses JAX's hardware acceleration for
significant speed-ups for learning in physics-based simulations. In terms of
open-loop wall-clock time, Assistax runs up to $370\times$ faster when
vectorising training runs compared to CPU-based alternatives. Assistax
conceptualises the interaction between an assistive robot and an active human
patient using multi-agent RL to train a population of diverse partner agents
against which an embodied robotic agent's zero-shot coordination capabilities
can be tested. Extensive evaluation and hyperparameter tuning for popular
continuous control RL and MARL algorithms provide reliable baselines and
establish Assistax as a practical benchmark for advancing RL research for
assistive robotics. The code is available at:

Abstract: This paper addresses the question of how able the current trends of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) are in managing to take the responsibility of a
full course of mathematics at a college level. The study evaluates this ability
in four significant aspects, namely, creating a course syllabus, presenting
selected material, answering student questions, and creating an assessment. It
shows that even though the AI is strong in some important parts like
organization and accuracy, there are still some human aspects that are far away
from the current abilities of AI. There is still a hidden emotional part, even
in science, that cannot be fulfilled by the AI in its current state. This paper
suggests some recommendations to integrate the human and AI potentials to
create better outcomes in terms of reaching the target of creating a full
course of mathematics, at a university level, as best as possible.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为BellNet的新方法，通过将策略迭代展开和截断为可学习的参数模型，以减少计算成本并有效逼近最优策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态规划方法在状态-动作空间大或涉及长期依赖时计算成本高，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 将策略迭代展开为可学习的参数模型BellNet，利用图信号处理重新参数化，并通过最小化Bellman误差进行训练。

Result: 初步实验表明，BellNet在网格环境中能以更少的迭代次数有效逼近最优策略。

Conclusion: BellNet提供了一种简洁、可迁移且统一的策略和价值迭代表示方法，显著降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental tool used across many engineering
fields. The main goal of DP is to solve Bellman's optimality equations for a
given Markov decision process (MDP). Standard methods like policy iteration
exploit the fixed-point nature of these equations to solve them iteratively.
However, these algorithms can be computationally expensive when the
state-action space is large or when the problem involves long-term
dependencies. Here we propose a new approach that unrolls and truncates policy
iterations into a learnable parametric model dubbed BellNet, which we train to
minimize the so-termed Bellman error from random value function
initializations. Viewing the transition probability matrix of the MDP as the
adjacency of a weighted directed graph, we draw insights from graph signal
processing to interpret (and compactly re-parameterize) BellNet as a cascade of
nonlinear graph filters. This fresh look facilitates a concise, transferable,
and unifying representation of policy and value iteration, with an explicit
handle on complexity during inference. Preliminary experiments conducted in a
grid-like environment demonstrate that BellNet can effectively approximate
optimal policies in a fraction of the iterations required by classical methods.

Conclusion: GDAIP有效解决了跨数据集个体脑区分割的域适应问题。

Abstract: Recent deep learning approaches have shown promise in learning such
individual brain parcellations from functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI). However, most existing methods assume consistent data distributions
across domains and struggle with domain shifts inherent to real-world
cross-dataset scenarios. To address this challenge, we proposed Graph Domain
Adaptation for Individual Parcellation (GDAIP), a novel framework that
integrates Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Minimax Entropy (MME)-based
domain adaptation. We construct cross-dataset brain graphs at both the group
and individual levels. By leveraging semi-supervised training and adversarial
optimization of the prediction entropy on unlabeled vertices from target brain
graph, the reference atlas is adapted from the group-level brain graph to the
individual brain graph, enabling individual parcellation under cross-dataset
settings. We evaluated our method using parcellation visualization, Dice
coefficient, and functional homogeneity. Experimental results demonstrate that
GDAIP produces individual parcellations with topologically plausible
boundaries, strong cross-session consistency, and ability of reflecting
functional organization.

Conclusion: 有界拟合在ALC及其片段中具有计算复杂性和学习效果的双重优势，为逻辑公式学习提供了新视角。

Abstract: Bounded fitting is a general paradigm for learning logical formulas from
positive and negative data examples, that has received considerable interest
recently. We investigate bounded fitting for the description logic ALC and its
syntactic fragments. We show that the underlying size-restricted fitting
problem is NP-complete for all studied fragments, even in the special case of a
single positive and a single negative example. By design, bounded fitting comes
with probabilistic guarantees in Valiant's PAC learning framework. In contrast,
we show that other classes of algorithms for learning ALC concepts do not
provide such guarantees. Finally, we present an implementation of bounded
fitting in ALC and its fragments based on a SAT solver. We discuss
optimizations and compare our implementation to other concept learning tools.

contexts remains a concern, with issues such as hallucinations persisting. This
study evaluates a RAG system used in due diligence for an investment fund. We
propose a robust evaluation protocol combining human annotations and LLM-Judge
annotations to identify system failures, like hallucinations, off-topic, failed

method, we achieve precise performance measurements with statistical
guarantees. We provide a comprehensive dataset for further analysis. Our
contributions aim to enhance the reliability and scalability of RAG systems

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的观测数据通常来自不同环境，具有异质性因果关系，而现有方法大多基于单一因果机制，无法有效处理这种异质性。

Method: MCVCI结合高斯混合模型和神经网络的拟合能力，利用混合条件变分自编码器的概率边界似然作为因果决策标准；MCVCC进一步将因果异质性建模为聚类数。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上，MCVCI和MCVCC表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MCVCI和MCVCC能有效推断异质性因果关系，揭示因果机制表达。

Abstract: Bivariate causal direction identification is a fundamental and vital problem
in the causal inference field. Among binary causal methods, most methods based
on additive noise only use one single causal mechanism to construct a causal
model. In the real world, observations are always collected in different
environments with heterogeneous causal relationships. Therefore, on observation
data, this paper proposes a Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Inference
model (MCVCI) to infer heterogeneous causality. Specifically, according to the
identifiability of the Hybrid Additive Noise Model (HANM), MCVCI combines the
superior fitting capabilities of the Gaussian mixture model and the neural
network and elegantly uses the likelihoods obtained from the probabilistic
bounds of the mixture conditional variational auto-encoder as causal decision
criteria. Moreover, we model the casual heterogeneity into cluster numbers and
propose the Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Clustering (MCVCC) method,
which can reveal causal mechanism expression. Compared with state-of-the-art
methods, the comprehensive best performance demonstrates the effectiveness of
the methods proposed in this paper on several simulated and real data.

TL;DR: MixGRPO提出了一种结合SDE和ODE的混合采样策略，通过滑动窗口机制优化MDP中的效率问题，显著提升了训练速度和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如FlowGRPO在图像生成的人偏好对齐中效率不足，因为需要在所有去噪步骤中进行采样和优化。

Method: MixGRPO引入滑动窗口机制，窗口内使用SDE采样和GRPO优化，窗口外使用ODE采样，减少优化开销并加速收敛。

Result: MixGRPO在效率上优于DanceGRPO，训练时间减少50%，其变体MixGRPO-Flash进一步减少71%训练时间。

Conclusion: MixGRPO通过混合采样策略和滑动窗口设计，显著提升了人偏好对齐的效率和性能。

Abstract: Although GRPO substantially enhances flow matching models in human preference
alignment of image generation, methods such as FlowGRPO still exhibit
inefficiency due to the necessity of sampling and optimizing over all denoising
steps specified by the Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we propose
$\textbf{MixGRPO}$, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed
sampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential
equations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the
optimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost
performance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using
SDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while
applying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the
time-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and
allowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence.
Additionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in
optimization, higher-order solvers are supported for sampling. So we present a
faster variant, termed $\textbf{MixGRPO-Flash}$, which further improves
training efficiency while achieving comparable performance. MixGRPO exhibits
substantial gains across multiple dimensions of human preference alignment,
outperforming DanceGRPO in both effectiveness and efficiency, with nearly 50%
lower training time. Notably, MixGRPO-Flash further reduces training time by
71%. Codes and models are available at

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence agents represent the next major revolution in the
continuous technological evolution of industrial automation. In this paper, we
introduce a new approach for business process design and development that
leverages the capabilities of Agentic AI. Departing from the traditional
task-based approach to business process design, we propose an agent-based
method, where agents contribute to the achievement of business goals,
identified by a set of business objects. When a single agent cannot fulfill a
goal, we have a merge goal that can be achieved through the collaboration of
multiple agents. The proposed model leads to a more modular and intelligent
business process development by organizing it around goals, objects, and
agents. As a result, this approach enables flexible and context-aware
automation in dynamic industrial environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将LLMs作为端到端预测器可能导致数值精度损失，或难以对齐文本与时间序列模态。DualSG旨在通过显式语义指导解决这些问题。

Method: 提出DualSG双流框架，引入Time Series Caption显式提示格式和caption-guided融合模块，结合传统预测与LLMs语义指导。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上，DualSG优于15种基线方法，验证了显式结合数值预测与语义指导的有效性。

Conclusion: DualSG框架通过显式语义指导显著提升了多变量时间序列预测性能，同时提供了可解释性。

Abstract: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting plays a key role in many applications.
Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take
advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as
end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and
forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively,
methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent
space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to
treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules
within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that
provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to
refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we
introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend
patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs,
rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the
latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly
models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation.
Experiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG
consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value
of explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.

Conclusion: 该方法为多智能体系统提供了一种实用且鲁棒的目标推断框架，推动了交互性和适应性研究。

Abstract: In multi-agent environments, effective interaction hinges on understanding
the beliefs and intentions of other agents. While prior work on goal
recognition has largely treated the observer as a passive reasoner, Active Goal
Recognition (AGR) focuses on strategically gathering information to reduce
uncertainty. We adopt a probabilistic framework for Active Goal Recognition and
propose an integrated solution that combines a joint belief update mechanism
with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, allowing the observer to plan
efficiently and infer the actor's hidden goal without requiring domain-specific
knowledge. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation in a grid-based domain,
we show that our joint belief update significantly outperforms passive goal
recognition, and that our domain-independent MCTS performs comparably to our
strong domain-specific greedy baseline. These results establish our solution as
a practical and robust framework for goal inference, advancing the field toward
more interactive and adaptive multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: EDGE-GRPO算法成功缓解了优势崩溃问题，表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in enhancing
step-by-step reasoning through reinforcement learning. However, the Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, which relies on sparse reward
rules, often encounters the issue of identical rewards within groups, leading
to the advantage collapse problem. Existing works typically address this
challenge from two perspectives: enforcing model reflection to enhance response
diversity, and introducing internal feedback to augment the training signal
(advantage). In this work, we begin by analyzing the limitations of model
reflection and investigating the policy entropy of responses at the
fine-grained sample level. Based on our experimental findings, we propose the
EDGE-GRPO algorithm, which adopts \textbf{E}ntropy-\textbf{D}riven Advantage
and \textbf{G}uided \textbf{E}rror Correction to effectively mitigate the
problem of advantage collapse. Extensive experiments on several main reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach. It is

Conclusion: MultiEditor通过联合编辑多模态数据，有效解决了长尾分布问题，提升了自动驾驶系统的感知性能。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely heavily on multimodal perception data to
understand complex environments. However, the long-tailed distribution of
real-world data hinders generalization, especially for rare but safety-critical
vehicle categories. To address this challenge, we propose MultiEditor, a
dual-branch latent diffusion framework designed to edit images and LiDAR point
clouds in driving scenarios jointly. At the core of our approach is introducing
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a structural and appearance prior for target
objects. Leveraging this prior, we design a multi-level appearance control
mechanism--comprising pixel-level pasting, semantic-level guidance, and
multi-branch refinement--to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction across
modalities. We further propose a depth-guided deformable cross-modality
condition module that adaptively enables mutual guidance between modalities
using 3DGS-rendered depth, significantly enhancing cross-modality consistency.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MultiEditor achieves superior
performance in visual and geometric fidelity, editing controllability, and
cross-modality consistency. Furthermore, generating rare-category vehicle data
with MultiEditor substantially enhances the detection accuracy of perception
models on underrepresented classes.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at predictive tasks on graph-structured
data but often lack the ability to incorporate symbolic domain knowledge and
perform general reasoning. Relational Bayesian Networks (RBNs), in contrast,
enable fully generative probabilistic modeling over graph-like structures and
support rich symbolic knowledge and probabilistic inference. This paper
presents a neuro-symbolic framework that seamlessly integrates GNNs into RBNs,
combining the learning strength of GNNs with the flexible reasoning
capabilities of RBNs.
  We develop two implementations of this integration: one compiles GNNs
directly into the native RBN language, while the other maintains the GNN as an
external component. Both approaches preserve the semantics and computational
properties of GNNs while fully aligning with the RBN modeling paradigm. We also
propose a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference method for these neuro-symbolic
models.
  To demonstrate the framework's versatility, we apply it to two distinct
problems. First, we transform a GNN for node classification into a collective
classification model that explicitly models homo- and heterophilic label
patterns, substantially improving accuracy. Second, we introduce a
multi-objective network optimization problem in environmental planning, where
MAP inference supports complex decision-making. Both applications include new
publicly available benchmark datasets.
  This work introduces a powerful and coherent neuro-symbolic approach to graph
data, bridging learning and reasoning in ways that enable novel applications
and improved performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Pain is a complex and pervasive condition that affects a significant portion
of the population. Accurate and consistent assessment is essential for
individuals suffering from pain, as well as for developing effective management
strategies in a healthcare system. Automatic pain assessment systems enable
continuous monitoring, support clinical decision-making, and help minimize
patient distress while mitigating the risk of functional deterioration.

TL;DR: 本研究利用大型语言模型（LLMs）对GitHub README文件进行自动分类，通过微调BERT、DistilBERT和RoBERTa模型，取得了0.98的F1分数，并探索了参数高效微调技术（PEFT）的经济性替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GitHub README文件的完整性对项目的采用和利用有重要影响，但许多仓库所有者忽视了这一点。本研究旨在通过自动分类工具提升README文件的质量和实用性。

Method: 研究采用BERT、DistilBERT和RoBERTa三种预训练模型，基于4226个README文件片段的黄金标准数据集进行微调，并探索了LoRA等PEFT技术。

Result: 微调后的模型在分类任务中表现优异，F1分数达0.98，且PEFT技术在性能损失较小的情况下提供了经济性替代方案。

Conclusion: 研究表明LLMs可用于自动分类GitHub README文件内容，为提升仓库识别和潜在用途提供了自动化工具支持。

Abstract: GitHub is the world's most popular platform for storing, sharing, and
managing code. Every GitHub repository has a README file associated with it.
The README files should contain project-related information as per the
recommendations of GitHub to support the usage and improvement of repositories.
However, GitHub repository owners sometimes neglected these recommendations.
This prevents a GitHub repository from reaching its full potential. This
research posits that the comprehensiveness of a GitHub repository's README file
significantly influences its adoption and utilization, with a lack of detail
potentially hindering its full potential for widespread engagement and impact
within the research community. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great
performance in many text-based tasks including text classification, text
generation, text summarization and text translation. In this study, an approach
is developed to fine-tune LLMs for automatically classifying different sections
of GitHub README files. Three encoder-only LLMs are utilized, including BERT,
DistilBERT and RoBERTa. These pre-trained models are then fine-tuned based on a
gold-standard dataset consisting of 4226 README file sections. This approach
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and has achieved an overall F1
score of 0.98. Moreover, we have also investigated the use of
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) and shown an economical alternative to full fine-tuning without
compromising much performance. The results demonstrate the potential of using
LLMs in designing an automatic classifier for categorizing the content of
GitHub README files. Consequently, this study contributes to the development of
automated tools for GitHub repositories to improve their identifications and
potential usages.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in text understanding and generation but
raise significant safety and ethical concerns in high-stakes applications. To
mitigate these risks, we present Libra-Guard, a cutting-edge safeguard system
designed to enhance the safety of Chinese-based LLMs. Leveraging a two-stage
curriculum training pipeline, Libra-Guard enhances data efficiency by employing
guard pretraining on synthetic samples, followed by fine-tuning on
high-quality, real-world data, thereby significantly reducing reliance on
manual annotations. To enable rigorous safety evaluations, we also introduce
Libra-Test, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the
effectiveness of safeguard systems for Chinese content. It covers seven
critical harm scenarios and includes over 5,700 samples annotated by domain
experts. Experiments show that Libra-Guard achieves 86.79% accuracy,
outperforming Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct (74.33%) and ShieldLM-Qwen-14B-Chat

These contributions establish a robust framework for advancing the safety
governance of Chinese LLMs and represent a tentative step toward developing

Motivation: 解决现有基于LLM的方法在隐私、依赖性和预测一致性方面的风险。

Method: 利用自然语言建模传感器数据和活动，通过其嵌入实现零样本分类。

Result: 在六个数据集上的详细案例研究表明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 语言建模可以增强零样本活动识别系统，避免依赖LLM带来的问题。

Abstract: Developing zero-shot human activity recognition (HAR) methods is a critical
direction in smart home research -- considering its impact on making HAR
systems work across smart homes having diverse sensing modalities, layouts, and
activities of interest. The state-of-the-art solutions along this direction are
based on generating natural language descriptions of the sensor data and
feeding it via a carefully crafted prompt to the LLM to perform classification.
Despite their performance guarantees, such ``prompt-the-LLM'' approaches carry
several risks, including privacy invasion, reliance on an external service, and
inconsistent predictions due to version changes, making a case for alternative
zero-shot HAR methods that do not require prompting the LLMs. In this paper, we
propose one such solution that models sensor data and activities using natural
language, leveraging its embeddings to perform zero-shot classification and
thereby bypassing the need to prompt the LLMs for activity predictions. The
impact of our work lies in presenting a detailed case study on six datasets,
highlighting how language modeling can bolster HAR systems in zero-shot
recognition.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种LLM规模上均显著优于现有推理和非推理模型，并能泛化到随机测试变体。

Conclusion: 领域适应和推理增强的LLMs在RCA任务中具有实用性和可解释性潜力。

Abstract: Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in mobile networks remains a challenging task due
to the need for interpretability, domain expertise, and causal reasoning. In
this work, we propose a lightweight framework that leverages Large Language
Models (LLMs) for RCA. To do so, we introduce TeleLogs, a curated dataset of
annotated troubleshooting problems designed to benchmark RCA capabilities. Our
evaluation reveals that existing open-source reasoning LLMs struggle with these
problems, underscoring the need for domain-specific adaptation. To address this
issue, we propose a two-stage training methodology that combines supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement learning to improve the accuracy and reasoning
quality of LLMs. The proposed approach fine-tunes a series of RCA models to
integrate domain knowledge and generate structured, multi-step diagnostic
explanations, improving both interpretability and effectiveness. Extensive
experiments across multiple LLM sizes show significant performance gains over
state-of-the-art reasoning and non-reasoning models, including strong
generalization to randomized test variants. These results demonstrate the
promise of domain-adapted, reasoning-enhanced LLMs for practical and
explainable RCA in network operation and management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升AI在公共卫生和生物医学科学中的透明度和信任，需要更清晰、上下文相关且社会可问责的解释。

Method: PHAX结合可废止推理、自适应自然语言技术和用户建模，生成上下文感知且针对特定受众的解释。

Result: PHAX在医疗术语简化、医患沟通和政策论证等用例中展示了其适用性，提升了可解释性和信任。

Conclusion: PHAX通过将形式推理方法与沟通需求结合，推动了透明、以人为中心的AI在公共卫生中的应用。

Abstract: Ensuring transparency and trust in AI-driven public health and biomedical
sciences systems requires more than accurate predictions-it demands
explanations that are clear, contextual, and socially accountable. While
explainable AI (XAI) has advanced in areas like feature attribution and model
interpretability, most methods still lack the structure and adaptability needed
for diverse health stakeholders, including clinicians, policymakers, and the
general public. We introduce PHAX-a Public Health Argumentation and
eXplainability framework-that leverages structured argumentation to generate
human-centered explanations for AI outputs. PHAX is a multi-layer architecture
combining defeasible reasoning, adaptive natural language techniques, and user
modeling to produce context-aware, audience-specific justifications. More
specifically, we show how argumentation enhances explainability by supporting
AI-driven decision-making, justifying recommendations, and enabling interactive
dialogues across user types. We demonstrate the applicability of PHAX through
use cases such as medical term simplification, patient-clinician communication,
and policy justification. In particular, we show how simplification decisions
can be modeled as argument chains and personalized based on user
expertise-enhancing both interpretability and trust. By aligning formal
reasoning methods with communicative demands, PHAX contributes to a broader
vision of transparent, human-centered AI in public health.

Conclusion: UI-AGILE框架通过综合改进训练和推理方法，显著提升了GUI代理的性能，解决了现有问题。

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven
significant advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent capabilities.
Nevertheless, existing GUI agent training and inference techniques still suffer
from a dilemma for reasoning designs, ineffective reward, and visual noise. To
address these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE, a comprehensive framework
enhancing GUI agents at both the training and inference stages. For training,
we propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process:
1) a Continuous Reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a
"Simple Thinking" reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy;
and 3) a Cropping-based Resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward
problem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present
Decomposed Grounding with Selection, a novel method that dramatically improves
grounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into
smaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2. For instance, using both our proposed training and inference
enhancement methods brings 23% grounding accuracy improvement over the best
baseline on ScreenSpot-Pro.

Motivation: 现有LLM代理在模糊、动态或间接表达的目标下与用户主动协作的能力尚未充分研究。

Method: 引入UserBench，模拟用户从模糊目标出发逐步揭示偏好的交互环境，要求代理主动澄清意图并利用工具决策。

Result: 评估显示，代理的任务完成与用户意图对齐率仅20%，高级模型主动发现用户偏好的比例不足30%。

Conclusion: UserBench为提升LLM代理的协作能力提供了重要工具，突显了构建真正协作伙伴的挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based agents have made impressive progress in
reasoning and tool use, enabling them to solve complex tasks. However, their
ability to proactively collaborate with users, especially when goals are vague,
evolving, or indirectly expressed, remains underexplored. To address this gap,
we introduce UserBench, a user-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents in
multi-turn, preference-driven interactions. UserBench features simulated users
who start with underspecified goals and reveal preferences incrementally,
requiring agents to proactively clarify intent and make grounded decisions with
tools. Our evaluation of leading open- and closed-source LLMs reveals a
significant disconnect between task completion and user alignment. For
instance, models provide answers that fully align with all user intents only
20% of the time on average, and even the most advanced models uncover fewer
than 30% of all user preferences through active interaction. These results
highlight the challenges of building agents that are not just capable task
executors, but true collaborative partners. UserBench offers an interactive
environment to measure and advance this critical capability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TFC-SR的持续学习方法，通过结合主动回忆机制（Active Recall Probe）来缓解深度神经网络中的灾难性遗忘问题，并在实验中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在持续学习任务中常面临灾难性遗忘问题，即学习新任务后对旧任务的性能下降。论文受人类学习策略（如主动回忆、刻意练习和间隔重复）启发，旨在提出一种更有效的解决方案。

Method: TFC-SR方法在标准经验回放基础上引入了主动回忆探针（Active Recall Probe），通过定期任务感知评估来稳定过去知识的表示。

Result: 在Split MNIST和Split CIFAR-100基准测试中，TFC-SR显著优于其他方法，例如在Split CIFAR-100上最终准确率达到13.17%，而标准回放方法仅为7.40%。

Conclusion: TFC-SR是一种高效且鲁棒的持续学习方法，强调了在系统中集成主动记忆检索机制的重要性，尤其在内存受限环境中表现优异。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks often suffer from a critical limitation known as
Catastrophic Forgetting, where performance on past tasks degrades after
learning new ones. This paper introduces a novel continual learning approach
inspired by human learning strategies like Active Recall, Deliberate Practice
and Spaced Repetition, named Task Focused Consolidation with Spaced Recall
(TFC-SR). TFC-SR enhances the standard experience replay with a mechanism we
termed the Active Recall Probe. It is a periodic, task-aware evaluation of the
model's memory that stabilizes the representations of past knowledge. We test
TFC-SR on the Split MNIST and Split CIFAR-100 benchmarks against leading
regularization-based and replay-based baselines. Our results show that TFC-SR
performs significantly better than these methods. For instance, on the Split
CIFAR-100, it achieves a final accuracy of 13.17% compared to standard replay's
7.40%. We demonstrate that this advantage comes from the stabilizing effect of
the probe itself, and not from the difference in replay volume. Additionally,
we analyze the trade-off between memory size and performance and show that
while TFC-SR performs better in memory-constrained environments, higher replay
volume is still more effective when available memory is abundant. We conclude
that TFC-SR is a robust and efficient approach, highlighting the importance of
integrating active memory retrieval mechanisms into continual learning systems.

Abstract: We demonstrate how Quantum Cognition Machine Learning (QCML) encodes data as

quantum geometry description endows the dataset with rich geometric and
topological structure - including intrinsic dimension, quantum metric, and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖核函数捕捉数据非线性，但需专家设计以确保最大化数据多样性和变异性。本文旨在通过独立性准则改进降维方法。

Method: 提出3种独立性准则，并设计无监督和监督降维方法，在线性和非线性设置下评估对比度、准确性和可解释性。

Result: 方法在性能上优于基线（如tSNE、PCA、VAE等），并推动了可解释机器学习的研究。

Conclusion: 该方法为可解释机器学习开辟了新方向，性能优于现有基线。

Abstract: Unsupervised and supervised learning methods conventionally use kernels to
capture nonlinearities inherent in data structure. However experts have to
ensure their proposed nonlinearity maximizes variability and capture inherent
diversity of data. We reviewed all independence criteria to design unsupervised
learners. Then we proposed 3 independence criteria and used them to design
unsupervised and supervised dimensionality reduction methods. We evaluated
contrast, accuracy and interpretability of these methods in both linear and
neural nonlinear settings. The results show that the methods have outperformed
the baseline (tSNE, PCA, regularized LDA, VAE with (un)supervised learner and
layer sharing) and opened a new line of interpretable machine learning (ML) for
the researchers.

Motivation: 野火对生态系统和人类健康造成严重影响，气候变化加剧了这一问题。现有数据存在不平衡性，且高维时空数据复杂性高，传统深度学习方法面临挑战。

Method: 采用对比学习框架，结合形态学课程学习，增强动态特征的潜在表示，减少计算成本并提高预测频率。

Result: 实验验证了所提方法的有效性，能够在较小补丁尺寸下保持性能。

Conclusion: 形态学课程对比学习为野火预测提供了一种高效解决方案，适用于复杂数据环境。

Abstract: Wildfires significantly impact natural ecosystems and human health, leading
to biodiversity loss, increased hydrogeological risks, and elevated emissions
of toxic substances. Climate change exacerbates these effects, particularly in
regions with rising temperatures and prolonged dry periods, such as the
Mediterranean. This requires the development of advanced risk management
strategies that utilize state-of-the-art technologies. However, in this
context, the data show a bias toward an imbalanced setting, where the incidence
of wildfire events is significantly lower than typical situations. This
imbalance, coupled with the inherent complexity of high-dimensional
spatio-temporal data, poses significant challenges for training deep learning
architectures. Moreover, since precise wildfire predictions depend mainly on
weather data, finding a way to reduce computational costs to enable more
frequent updates using the latest weather forecasts would be beneficial. This
paper investigates how adopting a contrastive framework can address these
challenges through enhanced latent representations for the patch's dynamic
features. We thus introduce a new morphology-based curriculum contrastive
learning that mitigates issues associated with diverse regional characteristics
and enables the use of smaller patch sizes without compromising performance. An
experimental analysis is performed to validate the effectiveness of the
proposed modeling strategies.

Result: 数值结果表明，该方法在较少迭代和较低计算复杂度下，实现了更优的检测性能。

Conclusion: DPST是一种适用于下一代大规模MIMO系统的实用解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a deep unfolding neural network-based MIMO detector
that incorporates complex-valued computations using Wirtinger calculus. The
method, referred as Dynamic Partially Shrinkage Thresholding (DPST), enables
efficient, interpretable, and low-complexity MIMO signal detection. Unlike
prior approaches that rely on real-valued approximations, our method operates
natively in the complex domain, aligning with the fundamental nature of signal
processing tasks. The proposed algorithm requires only a small number of
trainable parameters, allowing for simplified training. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior detection performance
with fewer iterations and lower computational complexity, making it a practical
solution for next-generation massive MIMO systems.

Conclusion: SPADE-S有效解决了时间序列预测中的异质性问题，显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in time series forecasting, accurate
modeling of time series with strong heterogeneity in magnitude and/or sparsity
patterns remains challenging for state-of-the-art deep learning architectures.
We identify several factors that lead existing models to systematically
underperform on low-magnitude and sparse time series, including loss functions
with implicit biases toward high-magnitude series, training-time sampling
methods, and limitations of time series encoding methods.
  SPADE-S is a robust forecasting architecture that significantly reduces
magnitude- and sparsity-based systematic biases and improves overall prediction
accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that SPADE-S outperforms existing
state-of-the-art approaches across a diverse set of use cases in demand
forecasting. In particular, we show that, depending on the quantile forecast
and magnitude of the series, SPADE-S can improve forecast accuracy by up to
15%. This results in P90 overall forecast accuracy gains of 2.21%, 6.58%, and
4.28%, and P50 forecast accuracy gains of 0.92%, 0.77%, and 1.95%,
respectively, for each of three distinct datasets, ranging from 3 million to

Conclusion: 本文填补了现有文献中对OOD数据分布偏移研究的空白，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: In the field of Machine Learning (ML) and data-driven applications, one of
the significant challenge is the change in data distribution between the
training and deployment stages, commonly known as distribution shift. This
paper outlines different mechanisms for handling two main types of distribution
shifts: (i) Covariate shift: where the value of features or covariates change
between train and test data, and (ii) Concept/Semantic-shift: where model
experiences shift in the concept learned during training due to emergence of
novel classes in the test phase. We sum up our contributions in three folds.
First, we formalize distribution shifts, recite on how the conventional method
fails to handle them adequately and urge for a model that can simultaneously
perform better in all types of distribution shifts. Second, we discuss why
handling distribution shifts is important and provide an extensive review of
the methods and techniques that have been developed to detect, measure, and
mitigate the effects of these shifts. Third, we discuss the current state of
distribution shift handling mechanisms and propose future research directions
in this area. Overall, we provide a retrospective synopsis of the literature in
the distribution shift, focusing on OOD data that had been overlooked in the
existing surveys.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督异常检测（UAD）在缺乏标记数据的情况下检测异常，但现有方法存在重建异常过于准确或特征空间次优的问题。

Method: 提出了一种新方法，将表示学习与OCSVM紧密结合，通过自定义损失函数直接对齐潜在特征与OCSVM决策边界。

Result: 在MNIST-C基准和脑MRI微小病变检测任务中表现出色，尤其在处理非高信号病变和域偏移方面具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在UAD和医学影像应用中具有潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) aims to detect anomalies without labeled
data, a necessity in many machine learning applications where anomalous samples
are rare or not available. Most state-of-the-art methods fall into two
categories: reconstruction-based approaches, which often reconstruct anomalies
too well, and decoupled representation learning with density estimators, which
can suffer from suboptimal feature spaces. While some recent methods attempt to
couple feature learning and anomaly detection, they often rely on surrogate
objectives, restrict kernel choices, or introduce approximations that limit
their expressiveness and robustness. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel method that tightly couples representation learning with an analytically
solvable one-class SVM (OCSVM), through a custom loss formulation that directly
aligns latent features with the OCSVM decision boundary. The model is evaluated
on two tasks: a new benchmark based on MNIST-C, and a challenging brain MRI
subtle lesion detection task. Unlike most methods that focus on large,
hyperintense lesions at the image level, our approach succeeds to target small,
non-hyperintense lesions, while we evaluate voxel-wise metrics, addressing a
more clinically relevant scenario. Both experiments evaluate a form of
robustness to domain shifts, including corruption types in MNIST-C and
scanner/age variations in MRI. Results demonstrate performance and robustness
of our proposed mode,highlighting its potential for general UAD and real-world
medical imaging applications. The source code is available at

self-evolving framework, AGORA, enables a collaborative ensemble to achieve
reasoning performance exceeding state-of-the-art monolithic systems by up to

from group emergent ability-the synthesis of collective capabilities
unattainable by isolated models, validating interaction as a scalable driver of

Motivation: 解决高性能机器学习模型（如XGBoost）在临床应用中因缺乏可解释性而受限的问题。

Result: 预测准确率达83%，比基线XGBoost高13%，并在21.7%不一致案例中修正预测。

Conclusion: LAI-ML成功将不透明的模型预测转化为可信且可解释的临床见解。

Abstract: Background & Aims: High-performance machine learning models like XGBoost are
often "black boxes," limiting their clinical adoption due to a lack of
interpretability. This study aims to bridge the gap between predictive accuracy
and narrative transparency for sarcopenia risk assessment. Methods: We propose
the LLM-Adapted Interpretation Framework (LAI-ML), a novel knowledge
distillation architecture. LAI-ML transforms feature attributions from a
trained XGBoost model into a probabilistic format using specialized techniques
(HAGA and CACS). A Large Language Model (LLM), guided by a reinforcement
learning loop and case-based retrieval, then generates data-faithful diagnostic
narratives. Results: The LAI-ML framework achieved 83% prediction accuracy,
significantly outperforming the baseline XGBoost model, 13% higher. Notably,
the LLM not only replicated the teacher model's logic but also corrected its
predictions in 21.7% of discordant cases, demonstrating enhanced reasoning.
Conclusion: LAI-ML effectively translates opaque model predictions into
trustworthy and interpretable clinical insights, offering a deployable solution
to the "black-box" problem in medical AI.

TL;DR: MaPPO是一种新的偏好优化框架，通过整合先验奖励知识改进现有方法，无需额外超参数，适用于离线和在线场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好优化方法（如DPO）将偏好学习视为最大似然估计问题，忽略了先验奖励知识，可能导致对齐效果不佳。

Method: MaPPO将先验奖励估计整合到最大后验目标中，扩展了DPO及其变体，支持离线和在线优化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MaPPO显著提升了对齐性能，且计算效率未受影响。

Conclusion: MaPPO是一种高效且通用的偏好优化方法，优于现有技术。

Abstract: As the era of large language models (LLMs) on behalf of users unfolds,
Preference Optimization (PO) methods have become a central approach to aligning
LLMs with human preferences and improving performance. We propose Maximum a
Posteriori Preference Optimization (MaPPO), a framework for learning from
preferences that explicitly incorporates prior reward knowledge into the
optimization objective. While existing methods such as Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) and its variants treat preference learning as a Maximum
Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problem, MaPPO extends this paradigm by integrating
prior reward estimates into a principled Maximum a Posteriori (MaP) objective.
This not only generalizes DPO and its variants, but also enhances alignment by
mitigating the oversimplified binary classification of responses. More
importantly, MaPPO introduces no additional hyperparameter, and supports
preference optimization in both offline and online settings. In addition, MaPPO
can be used as a plugin with consistent improvement on DPO variants, including
widely used SimPO, IPO, and CPO. Extensive empirical evaluations of different
model sizes and model series on three standard benchmarks, including MT-Bench,
AlpacaEval 2.0, and Arena-Hard, demonstrate consistent improvements in
alignment performance without sacrificing computational efficiency.

Conclusion: EvoSLD在准确性、可解释性和效率上优于基线方法，有望加速AI研究。

Abstract: Scaling laws are fundamental mathematical relationships that predict how
neural network performance evolves with changes in variables such as model
size, dataset size, and computational resources. Traditionally, discovering
these laws requires extensive human expertise and manual experimentation. We
introduce EvoSLD, an automated framework for Scaling Law Discovery (SLD) that
leverages evolutionary algorithms guided by Large Language Models (LLMs) to
co-evolve symbolic expressions and their optimization routines. Formulated to
handle scaling variables, control variables, and response metrics across
diverse experimental settings, EvoSLD searches for parsimonious, universal
functional forms that minimize fitting errors on grouped data subsets.
Evaluated on five real-world scenarios from recent literature, EvoSLD
rediscovers exact human-derived laws in two cases and surpasses them in others,
achieving up to orders-of-magnitude reductions in normalized mean squared error
on held-out test sets. Compared to baselines like symbolic regression and
ablated variants, EvoSLD demonstrates superior accuracy, interpretability, and
efficiency, highlighting its potential to accelerate AI research. Code is

Motivation: 临床决策支持中的LLMs在输入微小变化时表现不稳定，但传统NLP指标无法检测这种潜在表示变化，因此需要新的评估方法。

Method: 提出LAPD框架和LDFR指标，通过结构化对抗编辑（如掩码、否定、同义词替换和数值变化）测试临床LLMs的潜在鲁棒性。

Result: 实验发现，即使输入表面变化很小，临床LLMs仍表现出潜在脆弱性，且在真实临床数据（DiReCT基准）中验证了LDFR的普适性。

Conclusion: 几何感知的评估方法在临床AI中至关重要，揭示了表面鲁棒性与语义稳定性之间的差距。

Abstract: LLMs for clinical decision support often fail under small but clinically
meaningful input shifts such as masking a symptom or negating a finding,
despite high performance on static benchmarks. These reasoning failures
frequently go undetected by standard NLP metrics, which are insensitive to
latent representation shifts that drive diagnosis instability. We propose a
geometry-aware evaluation framework, LAPD (Latent Agentic Perturbation
Diagnostics), which systematically probes the latent robustness of clinical
LLMs under structured adversarial edits. Within this framework, we introduce
Latent Diagnosis Flip Rate (LDFR), a model-agnostic diagnostic signal that
captures representational instability when embeddings cross decision boundaries
in PCA-reduced latent space. Clinical notes are generated using a structured
prompting pipeline grounded in diagnostic reasoning, then perturbed along four
axes: masking, negation, synonym replacement, and numeric variation to simulate
common ambiguities and omissions. We compute LDFR across both foundation and
clinical LLMs, finding that latent fragility emerges even under minimal
surface-level changes. Finally, we validate our findings on 90 real clinical
notes from the DiReCT benchmark (MIMIC-IV), confirming the generalizability of
LDFR beyond synthetic settings. Our results reveal a persistent gap between
surface robustness and semantic stability, underscoring the importance of
geometry-aware auditing in safety-critical clinical AI.

Result: 在合成图去噪和语言标记图任务中，性能与轻量级GNN相当，但透明性和效率更高。

Conclusion: 该框架为图学习提供了一种原理清晰、可解释且资源高效的替代方案，优于深度神经网络架构。

Abstract: We present a fully non neural learning framework based on Graph Laplacian
Wavelet Transforms (GLWT). Unlike traditional architectures that rely on
convolutional, recurrent, or attention based neural networks, our model
operates purely in the graph spectral domain using structured multiscale
filtering, nonlinear shrinkage, and symbolic logic over wavelet coefficients.
Signals defined on graph nodes are decomposed via GLWT, modulated with
interpretable nonlinearities, and recombined for downstream tasks such as
denoising and token classification. The system supports compositional reasoning
through a symbolic domain-specific language (DSL) over graph wavelet
activations. Experiments on synthetic graph denoising and linguistic token
graphs demonstrate competitive performance against lightweight GNNs with far
greater transparency and efficiency. This work proposes a principled,
interpretable, and resource-efficient alternative to deep neural architectures

Result: 方法在异质图中表现不一致，无法通用。

Conclusion: 结构学习能改善长距离依赖捕获，但需进一步优化以适应不同异质图结构。

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) gained traction for graph representation
learning, with recent attention on improving performance on heterophilic graphs
for various real-world applications. The localized feature aggregation in a
typical message-passing paradigm hinders the capturing of long-range
dependencies between non-local nodes of the same class. The inherent
connectivity structure in heterophilic graphs often conflicts with information
sharing between distant nodes of same class. We propose structure learning to
rewire edges in shallow GCNs itself to avoid performance degradation in
downstream discriminative tasks due to oversmoothing. Parameterizing the
adjacency matrix to learn connections between non-local nodes and extend the
hop span of shallow GCNs facilitates the capturing of long-range dependencies.
However, our method is not generalizable across heterophilic graphs and
performs inconsistently on node classification task contingent to the graph
structure.

EdgeAgentX-DT utilizes network digital twins, virtual replicas synchronized
with real-world edge devices, to provide a secure, realistic environment for

models and transformers, the system creates diverse and adversarial scenarios
for robust simulation-based agent training. Our multi-layer architecture
includes: (1) on-device edge intelligence; (2) digital twin synchronization;
and (3) generative scenario training. Experimental simulations demonstrate
notable improvements over EdgeAgentX, including faster learning convergence,
higher network throughput, reduced latency, and improved resilience against
jamming and node failures. A case study involving a complex tactical scenario
with simultaneous jamming attacks, agent failures, and increased network loads
illustrates how EdgeAgentX-DT sustains operational performance, whereas
baseline methods fail. These results highlight the potential of

### [239] [AdaptHetero: Machine Learning Interpretation-Driven Subgroup Adaptation for EHR-Based Clinical Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21197)
*Ling Liao,Eva Aagaard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaptHetero是一个基于机器学习的框架，通过解释性分析指导针对不同子群体的模型训练和评估，提升EHR数据的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR数据的复杂性和异质性限制了机器学习解释性在子群体建模中的有效性，需要一种方法来转化解释性洞察为具体行动。

Method: 结合SHAP解释性和无监督聚类，识别临床有意义的子群体特征，优化模型训练和评估。

Result: 在三个大规模EHR数据集上验证，AdaptHetero能识别异质性模型行为，提升ICU死亡率等预测性能。

Conclusion: AdaptHetero通过解释性驱动的子群体建模，显著提升了EHR数据的预测效果和临床实用性。

Abstract: Machine learning interpretation has primarily been leveraged to build
clinician trust and uncover actionable insights in EHRs. However, the intrinsic
complexity and heterogeneity of EHR data limit its effectiveness in guiding
subgroup-specific modeling. We propose AdaptHetero, a novel MLI-driven
framework that transforms interpretability insights into actionable guidance
for tailoring model training and evaluation across subpopulations within
individual hospital systems. Evaluated on three large-scale EHR datasets -
GOSSIS-1-eICU, WiDS, and MIMIC-IV - AdaptHetero consistently identifies
heterogeneous model behaviors in predicting ICU mortality, in-hospital death,
and hidden hypoxemia. By integrating SHAP-based interpretation and unsupervised
clustering, the framework enhances the identification of clinically meaningful
subgroup-specific characteristics, leading to improved predictive performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对语言模型的梯度反转攻击方法Grab，通过混合优化显著提高了隐私数据恢复率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管梯度反转攻击在视觉模型中已被证明是联邦学习的隐私威胁，但在语言模型中因离散性被认为效果有限。本文旨在揭示其在语言模型中的潜在威胁。

Method: 提出Grab方法，结合两种交替优化过程：层间dropout掩码的同步优化和离散优化以改进token恢复与排序。

Result: Grab在基准和实际设置中分别实现了高达28.9%和48.5%的恢复率提升，最高恢复率达92.9%。

Conclusion: Grab为理解语言模型联邦学习中的隐私威胁提供了重要进展。

Abstract: The gradient inversion attack has been demonstrated as a significant privacy
threat to federated learning (FL), particularly in continuous domains such as
vision models. In contrast, it is often considered less effective or highly
dependent on impractical training settings when applied to language models, due
to the challenges posed by the discrete nature of tokens in text data. As a
result, its potential privacy threats remain largely underestimated, despite FL
being an emerging training method for language models. In this work, we propose
a domain-specific gradient inversion attack named Grab (gradient inversion with
hybrid optimization). Grab features two alternating optimization processes to
address the challenges caused by practical training settings, including a
simultaneous optimization on dropout masks between layers for improved token
recovery and a discrete optimization for effective token sequencing. Grab can
recover a significant portion (up to 92.9% recovery rate) of the private
training data, outperforming the attack strategy of utilizing discrete
optimization with an auxiliary model by notable improvements of up to 28.9%
recovery rate in benchmark settings and 48.5% recovery rate in practical
settings. Grab provides a valuable step forward in understanding this privacy
threat in the emerging FL training mode of language models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于单一组合式LLM的新型范式，用于无线网络中的交互式多模态应用（IMAs），通过ContextLoRA和ContextGear解决多样任务适应和资源效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖多个LLM支持IMAs，效率低且资源消耗大，因此探索单一LLM的解决方案以提高灵活性和效率。

Method: 提出ContextLoRA方法，通过任务依赖图学习IMAs的结构化上下文，并开发分步微调流程；引入ContextGear调度策略优化训练成本。

Result: 在三个基准测试中表现优越，并在真实无线测试平台上验证了实用性。

Conclusion: 提出的范式在效率和适应性上优于现有方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Interactive multimodal applications (IMAs), such as route planning in the
Internet of Vehicles, enrich users' personalized experiences by integrating
various forms of data over wireless networks. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) utilize mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanisms to empower multiple
IMAs, with each LLM trained individually for a specific task that presents
different business workflows. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on
multiple LLMs for IMAs, this paper presents a novel paradigm that accomplishes
various IMAs using a single compositional LLM over wireless networks. The two
primary challenges include 1) guiding a single LLM to adapt to diverse IMA
objectives and 2) ensuring the flexibility and efficiency of the LLM in
resource-constrained mobile environments. To tackle the first challenge, we
propose ContextLoRA, a novel method that guides an LLM to learn the rich
structured context among IMAs by constructing a task dependency graph. We
partition the learnable parameter matrix of neural layers for each IMA to
facilitate LLM composition. Then, we develop a step-by-step fine-tuning
procedure guided by task relations, including training, freezing, and masking
phases. This allows the LLM to learn to reason among tasks for better
adaptation, capturing the latent dependencies between tasks. For the second
challenge, we introduce ContextGear, a scheduling strategy to optimize the
training procedure of ContextLoRA, aiming to minimize computational and
communication costs through a strategic grouping mechanism. Experiments on
three benchmarks show the superiority of the proposed ContextLoRA and
ContextGear. Furthermore, we prototype our proposed paradigm on a real-world
wireless testbed, demonstrating its practical applicability for various IMAs.
We will release our code to the community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的数据分布与精心整理的数据集差异显著，且常存在长尾不平衡和分布偏移，导致传统算法表现不佳。需要开发能从多样化、不完美数据中学习的鲁棒算法。

Method: 论文分为四部分：1) 从长尾数据学习生成模型；2) 通过归纳正则化提升尾部类别的泛化能力；3) 半监督学习优化长尾数据指标；4) 高效域适应。

Result: 开发了能够从有限和不完美数据中学习的深度学习算法，解决了长尾数据中的模式崩溃、泛化能力不足等问题。

Conclusion: 提出的算法扩展了深度学习在现实世界数据中的应用，减少了数据整理的劳动密集型需求。

Abstract: The distribution of data in the world (eg, internet, etc.) significantly
differs from the well-curated datasets and is often over-populated with samples
from common categories. The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets
perform suboptimally when used for learning from imperfect datasets with
long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. To expand the use of deep
models, it is essential to overcome the labor-intensive curation process by
developing robust algorithms that can learn from diverse, real-world data
distributions. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep
Neural Networks which can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the
real world. This thesis is divided into four segments, each covering a scenario
of learning from limited or imperfect data. The first part of the thesis
focuses on Learning Generative Models from Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate
the mode-collapse and enable diverse aesthetic image generations for tail
(minority) classes. In the second part, we enable effective generalization on
tail classes through Inductive Regularization schemes, which allow tail classes
to generalize as effectively as the head classes without requiring explicit
generation of images. In the third part, we develop algorithms for Optimizing
Relevant Metrics for learning from long-tailed data with limited annotation
(semi-supervised), followed by the fourth part, which focuses on the Efficient
Domain Adaptation of the model to various domains with very few to zero labeled
samples.

TL;DR: Bubbleformer是一种基于Transformer的时空模型，能够自主预测沸腾动力学，包括成核、界面演化和热传递，无需依赖模拟数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在推理时需要未来输入（如气泡位置），无法从过去状态学习成核现象，且无法建模流动沸腾速度场。

Method: Bubbleformer结合了因子化轴向注意力、频率感知缩放和热物理参数条件化，适用于不同流体、几何形状和操作条件。

Result: Bubbleformer在预测和预报两相沸腾流动方面取得了新的基准结果。

Conclusion: Bubbleformer通过物理指标评估物理保真度，并发布了BubbleML 2.0数据集，为沸腾动力学建模提供了新工具。

Abstract: Modeling boiling (an inherently chaotic, multiphase process central to energy
and thermal systems) remains a significant challenge for neural PDE surrogates.
Existing models require future input (e.g., bubble positions) during inference
because they fail to learn nucleation from past states, limiting their ability
to autonomously forecast boiling dynamics. They also fail to model flow boiling
velocity fields, where sharp interface-momentum coupling demands long-range and
directional inductive biases. We introduce Bubbleformer, a transformer-based
spatiotemporal model that forecasts stable and long-range boiling dynamics
including nucleation, interface evolution, and heat transfer without dependence
on simulation data during inference. Bubbleformer integrates factorized axial
attention, frequency-aware scaling, and conditions on thermophysical parameters
to generalize across fluids, geometries, and operating conditions. To evaluate
physical fidelity in chaotic systems, we propose interpretable physics-based
metrics that evaluate heat-flux consistency, interface geometry, and mass
conservation. We also release BubbleML 2.0, a high-fidelity dataset that spans
diverse working fluids (cryogens, refrigerants, dielectrics), boiling
configurations (pool and flow boiling), flow regimes (bubbly, slug, annular),
and boundary conditions. Bubbleformer sets new benchmark results in both
prediction and forecasting of two-phase boiling flows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多源噪声实验数据整合到生成模型中的挑战，避免手动调整噪声水平和权重。

Method: 提出Adam-PnP框架，结合自适应噪声估计和动态模态加权，引导预训练的蛋白质扩散模型。

Result: 在复杂重建任务中显著提高了准确性。

Conclusion: Adam-PnP为多源数据整合提供了高效且自动化的解决方案。

Abstract: In an inverse problem, the goal is to recover an unknown parameter (e.g., an
image) that has typically undergone some lossy or noisy transformation during
measurement. Recently, deep generative models, particularly diffusion models,
have emerged as powerful priors for protein structure generation. However,
integrating noisy experimental data from multiple sources to guide these models
remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often require precise
knowledge of experimental noise levels and manually tuned weights for each data
modality. In this work, we introduce Adam-PnP, a Plug-and-Play framework that
guides a pre-trained protein diffusion model using gradients from multiple,
heterogeneous experimental sources. Our framework features an adaptive noise
estimation scheme and a dynamic modality weighting mechanism integrated into
the diffusion process, which reduce the need for manual hyperparameter tuning.
Experiments on complex reconstruction tasks demonstrate significantly improved
accuracy using Adam-PnP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCE在高维问题中因基函数数量指数增长而扩展性差，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 结合PCE与概率电路，提出DeepPCE，一种适用于高维输入空间的深度推广方法。

Result: DeepPCE在预测性能上与多层感知器（MLP）相当，同时保留了PCE的精确统计推断能力。

Conclusion: DeepPCE是一种高效且可扩展的替代方法，适用于高维不确定性量化问题。

Abstract: Polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is a classical and widely used surrogate
modeling technique in physical simulation and uncertainty quantification. By
taking a linear combination of a set of basis polynomials - orthonormal with
respect to the distribution of uncertain input parameters - PCE enables
tractable inference of key statistical quantities, such as (conditional) means,
variances, covariances, and Sobol sensitivity indices, which are essential for
understanding the modeled system and identifying influential parameters and
their interactions. As the number of basis functions grows exponentially with
the number of parameters, PCE does not scale well to high-dimensional problems.
We address this challenge by combining PCE with ideas from probabilistic
circuits, resulting in the deep polynomial chaos expansion (DeepPCE) - a deep
generalization of PCE that scales effectively to high-dimensional input spaces.
DeepPCE achieves predictive performance comparable to that of multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs), while retaining PCE's ability to compute exact statistical
inferences via simple forward passes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推荐系统中多样性和新颖性不足的问题，避免传统强化学习依赖随机探索的局限性。

Method: 利用LLM作为参考策略提出新颖项目，通过轻量级策略优化建议，采用双层优化和正则化技术。

Result: 在真实数据集上，LAAC在多样性、新颖性和准确性上优于现有基线，且对不平衡数据具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LAAC成功整合LLM知识，无需昂贵微调，显著提升推荐系统性能。

Abstract: In recommendation systems, diversity and novelty are essential for capturing
varied user preferences and encouraging exploration, yet many systems
prioritize click relevance. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored
to improve diversity, it often depends on random exploration that may not align
with user interests. We propose LAAC (LLM-guided Adversarial Actor Critic), a
novel method that leverages large language models (LLMs) as reference policies
to suggest novel items, while training a lightweight policy to refine these
suggestions using system-specific data. The method formulates training as a
bilevel optimization between actor and critic networks, enabling the critic to
selectively favor promising novel actions and the actor to improve its policy
beyond LLM recommendations. To mitigate overestimation of unreliable LLM
suggestions, we apply regularization that anchors critic values for unexplored
items close to well-estimated dataset actions. Experiments on real-world
datasets show that LAAC outperforms existing baselines in diversity, novelty,
and accuracy, while remaining robust on imbalanced data, effectively
integrating LLM knowledge without expensive fine-tuning.

Motivation: 数据驱动方法在混沌动力学降阶建模中表现强大，但仍有潜力通过结合已知物理（FOM）进一步提升预测能力。

Method: 开发了一种混合ROM，将FOM的向量场投影到不变流形上，并通过动态数据或贝叶斯先验进行修正，使用神经ODE方法。

Result: 在Kuramoto-Sivashinsky和复杂Ginzburg-Landau方程的模拟数据中，混合方法在数据充足、稀缺甚至FOM参数错误的情况下，显著提升了时间序列预测能力。

Conclusion: 混合方法结合数据和物理模型，显著优于纯数据驱动方法，适用于多种数据场景。

Abstract: While data-driven techniques are powerful tools for reduced-order modeling of
systems with chaotic dynamics, great potential remains for leveraging known
physics (i.e. a full-order model (FOM)) to improve predictive capability. We
develop a hybrid reduced order model (ROM), informed by both data and FOM, for
evolving spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics on an invariant manifold whose
coordinates are found using an autoencoder. This approach projects the vector
field of the FOM onto the invariant manifold; then, this physics-derived vector
field is either corrected using dynamic data, or used as a Bayesian prior that
is updated with data. In both cases, the neural ordinary differential equation
approach is used. We consider simulated data from the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and
complex Ginzburg-Landau equations. Relative to the data-only approach, for
scenarios of abundant data, scarce data, and even an incorrect FOM (i.e.
erroneous parameter values), the hybrid approach yields substantially improved
time-series predictions.

Result: 方法能够学习变形物体的时空表示，结合图像监督和物理约束，提高模拟精度和结果可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架为弹性物体重建与模拟提供了一种高效且物理一致的方法。

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling physical
systems, offering the ability to learn complex representations from limited
data while integrating foundational scientific knowledge. In particular,
neuro-symbolic approaches that combine data-driven learning, the neuro, with
symbolic equations and rules, the symbolic, address the tension between methods
that are purely empirical, which risk straying from established physical
principles, and traditional numerical solvers that demand complete geometric
knowledge and can be prohibitively expensive for high-fidelity simulations. In
this work, we present a novel neuro-symbolic framework for reconstructing and
simulating elastic objects directly from sparse multi-view image sequences,
without requiring explicit geometric information. Specifically, we integrate a
neural radiance field (NeRF) for object reconstruction with physics-informed
neural networks (PINN) that incorporate the governing partial differential
equations of elasticity. In doing so, our method learns a spatiotemporal
representation of deforming objects that leverages both image supervision and
symbolic physical constraints. To handle complex boundary and initial
conditions, which are traditionally confronted using finite element methods,
boundary element methods, or sensor-based measurements, we employ an
energy-constrained Physics-Informed Neural Network architecture. This design
enhances both simulation accuracy and the explainability of results.

Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在类相似性、多模态分布和噪声等挑战性数据条件下性能下降的问题。

Method: 提出CDNet，利用卷积近似反向扩散步骤学习样本间转换，结合不确定性加权损失进行鲁棒训练。

Result: 在UCR Archive和模拟数据集上显著提升现有分类器性能，尤其在噪声、相似和多模态条件下。

Conclusion: CDNet通过对比扩散和鲁棒训练有效提升了时间序列分类的性能。

Abstract: Deep learning models are widely used for time series classification (TSC) due
to their scalability and efficiency. However, their performance degrades under
challenging data conditions such as class similarity, multimodal distributions,
and noise. To address these limitations, we propose CDNet, a Contrastive
Diffusion-based Network that enhances existing classifiers by generating
informative positive and negative samples via a learned diffusion process.
Unlike traditional diffusion models that denoise individual samples, CDNet
learns transitions between samples--both within and across classes--through
convolutional approximations of reverse diffusion steps. We introduce a
theoretically grounded CNN-based mechanism to enable both denoising and mode
coverage, and incorporate an uncertainty-weighted composite loss for robust
training. Extensive experiments on the UCR Archive and simulated datasets
demonstrate that CDNet significantly improves state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep
learning classifiers, particularly under noisy, similar, and multimodal
conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NCO求解器多关注单车辆VRP，忽略了更现实的多车辆MMHCVRP问题，且现有方法在解码时存在短视决策和忽略关键特性的问题。

Method: ECHO采用双模态节点编码器捕捉节点间局部拓扑关系，使用参数无关交叉注意力机制减少短视决策，并通过数据增强策略优化训练。

Result: 实验表明ECHO在车辆和节点数量变化时表现优于现有NCO求解器，并具有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: ECHO通过改进编码器和解码策略，有效解决了MMHCVRP问题，并通过实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Numerous Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) solvers have been proposed
to address Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). However, most of these solvers
focus exclusively on single-vehicle VRP variants, overlooking the more
realistic min-max Heterogeneous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (MMHCVRP),
which involves multiple vehicles. Existing MMHCVRP solvers typically select a
vehicle and its next node to visit at each decoding step, but often make myopic
decoding decisions and overlook key properties of MMHCVRP, including local
topological relationships, vehicle permutation invariance, and node symmetry,
resulting in suboptimal performance. To better address these limitations, we
propose ECHO, an efficient NCO solver. First, ECHO exploits the proposed
dual-modality node encoder to capture local topological relationships among
nodes. Subsequently, to mitigate myopic decisions, ECHO employs the proposed
Parameter-Free Cross-Attention mechanism to prioritize the vehicle selected in
the preceding decoding step. Finally, leveraging vehicle permutation invariance
and node symmetry, we introduce a tailored data augment strategy for MMHCVRP to
stabilize the Reinforcement Learning training process. To assess the
performance of ECHO, we conduct extensive experiments. The experimental results
demonstrate that ECHO outperforms state-of-the-art NCO solvers across varying
numbers of vehicles and nodes, and exhibits well-performing generalization
across both scales and distribution patterns. Finally, ablation studies
validate the effectiveness of all proposed methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络（如RNN、CNN和Transformer）在处理长序列时因内存限制而表现不佳，SSMs虽能解决这一问题，但计算和内存需求高，需要专用硬件支持。

Method: 设计了基于脉动阵列的EpochCore加速器，引入LIMA-PE处理单元和ProDF数据流，优化SSM模型的执行效率。

Conclusion: EpochCore为长序列任务中的SSM模型提供了高效的硬件解决方案，显著优于传统加速器和GPU。

Abstract: Sequence modeling is crucial for AI to understand temporal data and detect
complex time-dependent patterns. While recurrent neural networks (RNNs),
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Transformers have advanced in
capturing long-range dependencies, they struggle with achieving high accuracy
with very long sequences due to limited memory retention (fixed context
window). State-Space Models (SSMs) leverage exponentially decaying memory
enabling lengthy context window and so they process very long data sequences
more efficiently than recurrent and Transformer-based models. Unlike
traditional neural models like CNNs and RNNs, SSM-based models require solving
differential equations through continuous integration, making training and
inference both compute- and memory-intensive on conventional CPUs and GPUs. In
this paper we introduce a specialized hardware accelerator, EpochCore, for
accelerating SSMs. EpochCore is based on systolic arrays (SAs) and is designed
to enhance the energy efficiency and throughput of inference of SSM-based
models for long-range sequence tasks. Within the SA, we propose a versatile
processing element (PE) called LIMA-PE to perform traditional and specialized
MAC operations to support traditional DNNs and SSMs. To complement the
EpochCore microarchitecture, we propose a novel dataflow, ProDF, which enables
highly efficient execution of SSM-based models. By leveraging the LIMA-PE
microarchitecture and ProDF, EpochCore achieves on average 250x gains in
performance and 45x improvement in energy efficiency, at the expense of 2x
increase in area cost over traditional SA-based accelerators, and around
~2,000x improvement in latency/inference on LRA datasets compared to GPU kernel
operations.

Motivation: 在多目标强化学习中，系统探索非凸奖励目标下的Pareto稳态解是一个重要但研究不足的问题。

Method: 提出MOCHA算法，结合加权Chebyshev和actor-critic框架，通过选择学习率实现样本复杂度为O(ε^{-2})。

Result: MOCHA在KuaiRand离线数据集上的表现显著优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: MOCHA填补了多目标强化学习中的理论空白，为系统探索Pareto稳态解提供了有效工具。

Abstract: In many multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) applications, being
able to systematically explore the Pareto-stationary solutions under multiple
non-convex reward objectives with theoretical finite-time sample complexity
guarantee is an important and yet under-explored problem. This motivates us to
take the first step and fill the important gap in MORL. Specifically, in this
paper, we propose a \uline{M}ulti-\uline{O}bjective weighted-\uline{CH}ebyshev
\uline{A}ctor-critic (MOCHA) algorithm for MORL, which judiciously integrates
the weighted-Chebychev (WC) and actor-critic framework to enable
Pareto-stationarity exploration systematically with finite-time sample
complexity guarantee. Sample complexity result of MOCHA algorithm reveals an
interesting dependency on $p_{\min}$ in finding an $\epsilon$-Pareto-stationary
solution, where $p_{\min}$ denotes the minimum entry of a given weight vector
$\mathbf{p}$ in WC-scarlarization. By carefully choosing learning rates, the
sample complexity for each exploration can be
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$. Furthermore, simulation studies on a
large KuaiRand offline dataset, show that the performance of MOCHA algorithm
significantly outperforms other baseline MORL approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示LIT-PCBA数据集在虚拟筛选基准测试中的严重缺陷，以提醒社区关注数据质量对模型评估的影响。

Method: 通过审计数据集，识别数据泄漏、重复和结构冗余问题，并设计一个基于记忆的基线方法验证这些缺陷的影响。

Result: 发现大量数据泄漏和冗余，导致模型无法泛化；简单记忆方法在LIT-PCBA上优于先进模型。

Conclusion: LIT-PCBA不适合作为公平的模型评估基准，呼吁社区开发更可靠的数据集。

Abstract: LIT-PCBA is a widely used benchmark for virtual screening, but our audit
reveals it is fundamentally compromised. The dataset suffers from egregious
data leakage, rampant duplication, and pervasive analog redundancy -- flaws
that invalidate its use for fair model evaluation. Notably, we identify 2,491
inactives duplicated across training and validation sets, and thousands more
repeated within individual data splits (2,945 in training, 789 in validation).
Critically, three ligands in the query set -- meant to represent unseen test
cases -- are leaked: two appear in the training set, one in validation.
Structural redundancy compounds these issues: for some targets, over 80% of
query ligands are near duplicates, with Tanimoto similarity >= 0.9. In ALDH1
alone, we find 323 highly similar active pairs between training and validation
sets, invalidating claims of chemical diversity. These and other flaws
collectively cause models trained on LIT-PCBA to memorize rather than
generalize. To demonstrate the consequences of these data integrity failures,
we implement a trivial memorization-based baseline -- using no learning, no

Result: 在基准数据集上，该方法在异质图和同质图中均优于现有方法，并在噪声图中保持高准确性。

Conclusion: 扭矩驱动的层次化重连策略有效提升了GNNs在复杂图结构中的性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning from
graph-structured data, leveraging message passing to diffuse information and
update node representations. However, most efforts have suggested that native
interactions encoded in the graph may not be friendly for this process,
motivating the development of graph rewiring methods. In this work, we propose
a torque-driven hierarchical rewiring strategy, inspired by the notion of
torque in classical mechanics, dynamically modulating message passing to
improve representation learning in heterophilous graphs and enhance robustness
against noisy graphs. Specifically, we define an interference-aware torque
metric that integrates structural distance and energy scores to quantify the
perturbation induced by edges, thereby encouraging each node to aggregate
information from its nearest low-energy neighbors. We use the metric to
hierarchically reconfigure the receptive field of each layer by judiciously
pruning high-torque edges and adding low-torque links, suppressing propagation
noise and boosting pertinent signals. Extensive evaluations on benchmark
datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on both
heterophilous and homophilous graphs, and maintains high accuracy on noisy
graph.

TL;DR: MemShare是一种新型KV缓存管理方法，通过识别可重用的KV缓存块，显著减少内存开销并提高吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在推理过程中生成的冗长思维链导致内存开销大，且中间推理步骤高度相似。

Method: 提出MemShare，采用协同过滤算法识别可重用的KV缓存块，并实现零拷贝缓存重用。

Result: 实验表明，MemShare在保持准确性的同时，吞吐量提升高达84.79%。

Conclusion: MemShare有效减少内存开销，提升推理效率，优于现有KV缓存管理方法。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved significant advances in
mathematical reasoning and formal logic tasks. However, their tendency to
generate lengthy chain-of-thought sequences leads to substantial memory
overhead during inference. We observe that LRMs frequently produce highly
similar intermediate reasoning steps, which correspond to similar KV cache
states across layers. Motivated by this observation, we propose MemShare, a
novel KV cache management approach that effectively reduces memory overhead.
MemShare employs a collaborative filtering algorithm to efficiently identify
reusable KV cache blocks and enables zero copy cache reuse to significantly
reduce memory overhead, improve throughput while maintaining accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate that MemShare delivers up to 84.79\%
improvement in throughput while maintaining better accuracy compared to
existing KV cache management methods.

TL;DR: 提出了两种新框架PVD-Net和PVD-ONet，用于解决物理信息神经网络在奇异扰动问题中的收敛问题，无需数据依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物理信息神经网络在奇异扰动问题中难以收敛，需要改进。

Method: PVD-Net采用两网络或五网络设计，分别针对稳定性和高精度需求；PVD-ONet通过组合多个DeepONet模块实现算子学习。

Result: 数值实验表明，新方法在多种误差指标下优于现有基线。

Conclusion: PVD-Net和PVD-ONet为多尺度问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks and Physics-informed DeepONet excel in
solving partial differential equations; however, they often fail to converge
for singularly perturbed problems. To address this, we propose two novel
frameworks, Prandtl-Van Dyke neural network (PVD-Net) and its operator learning
extension Prandtl-Van Dyke Deep Operator Network (PVD-ONet), which rely solely
on governing equations without data. To address varying task-specific
requirements, both PVD-Net and PVD-ONet are developed in two distinct versions,
tailored respectively for stability-focused and high-accuracy modeling. The
leading-order PVD-Net adopts a two-network architecture combined with Prandtl's
matching condition, targeting stability-prioritized scenarios. The high-order
PVD-Net employs a five-network design with Van Dyke's matching principle to
capture fine-scale boundary layer structures, making it ideal for high-accuracy
scenarios. PVD-ONet generalizes PVD-Net to the operator learning setting by
assembling multiple DeepONet modules, directly mapping initial conditions to
solution operators and enabling instant predictions for an entire family of
boundary layer problems without retraining. Numerical experiments on various
models show that our proposed methods consistently outperform existing
baselines under various error metrics, thereby offering a powerful new approach
for multi-scale problems.

Motivation: 扩散策略生成动作耗时，现有蒸馏方法训练时间长，需改进。

Method: RAGDP利用向量数据库检索专家动作，结合中间去噪步骤减少推理步骤。

Result: RAGDP在加速20倍时仍保持准确性优势，比蒸馏模型高7%。

Conclusion: RAGDP是一种高效且无需额外训练的扩散策略加速方法。

Abstract: Diffusion Policies (DPs) have attracted attention for their ability to
achieve significant accuracy improvements in various imitation learning tasks.
However, DPs depend on Diffusion Models, which require multiple noise removal
steps to generate a single action, resulting in long generation times. To solve
this problem, knowledge distillation-based methods such as Consistency Policy
(CP) have been proposed. However, these methods require a significant amount of
training time, especially for difficult tasks. In this study, we propose RAGDP
(Retrieve-Augmented Generation for Diffusion Policies) as a novel framework
that eliminates the need for additional training using a knowledge base to
expedite the inference of pre-trained DPs. In concrete, RAGDP encodes
observation-action pairs through the DP encoder to construct a vector database
of expert demonstrations. During inference, the current observation is
embedded, and the most similar expert action is extracted. This extracted
action is combined with an intermediate noise removal step to reduce the number
of steps required compared to the original diffusion step. We show that by
using RAGDP with the base model and existing acceleration methods, we improve
the accuracy and speed trade-off with no additional training. Even when
accelerating the models 20 times, RAGDP maintains an advantage in accuracy,
with a 7% increase over distillation models such as CP.

Abstract: Any agents we can possibly build are subject to capacity constraints, as
memory and compute resources are inherently finite. However, comparatively
little attention has been dedicated to understanding how agents with limited
capacity should allocate their resources for optimal performance. The goal of
this paper is to shed some light on this question by studying a simple yet
relevant continual learning problem: the capacity-constrained
linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) sequential prediction problem. We derive a
solution to this problem under appropriate technical conditions. Moreover, for
problems that can be decomposed into a set of sub-problems, we also demonstrate
how to optimally allocate capacity across these sub-problems in the steady
state. We view the results of this paper as a first step in the systematic
theoretical study of learning under capacity constraints.

Result: 实验证明Latte在分散式环境中表现优异，且通信和计算成本极低。

Conclusion: Latte有效解决了联邦学习中的分布偏移问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation with pre-trained vision-language models has gained
increasing attention for addressing distribution shifts during testing. Among
these approaches, memory-based algorithms stand out due to their training-free
nature and ability to leverage historical test data. However, existing
test-time adaptation methods are typically designed for a single domain with
abundant data. In decentralized settings such as federated learning, applying
these methods individually to each client suffers from limited test data, while
directly sharing a single global memory via the server prevents proper
personalization to each client's unique distribution. To address this, we
propose Latte, a novel framework where each client maintains a local memory to
store embeddings from its own historical test data and an external memory to
store class prototypes from other relevant clients. During communication, each
client retrieves prototypes from similar clients under the server's
coordination to expand its memory. For local adaptation, Latte utilizes both
embedding similarity and uncertainty to enhance model performance. Our
theoretical analysis shows that Latte effectively leverages in-distribution
clients while remaining robust to out-of-distribution clients. Extensive
experiments on domain adaptation and corruption benchmarks validate that Latte
achieves superior performance in decentralized settings, while introducing only
negligible communication and computation costs. Our code is available at

Abstract: The rise of LLM-based agents has opened new frontiers in AI applications, yet
evaluating these agents remains a complex and underdeveloped area. This survey
provides an in-depth overview of the emerging field of LLM agent evaluation,
introducing a two-dimensional taxonomy that organizes existing work along (1)

capabilities, reliability, and safety -- and (2) evaluation process -- how to
evaluate, including interaction modes, datasets and benchmarks, metric
computation methods, and tooling. In addition to taxonomy, we highlight
enterprise-specific challenges, such as role-based access to data, the need for
reliability guarantees, dynamic and long-horizon interactions, and compliance,
which are often overlooked in current research. We also identify future
research directions, including holistic, more realistic, and scalable
evaluation. This work aims to bring clarity to the fragmented landscape of

Result: 模型在合成数据和神经记录上验证，能准确恢复流形结构，且计算成本随数据长度线性增长。

Conclusion: 该模型在效率和可解释性上优于现有方法，适用于复杂时间序列建模。

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis suggests that high-dimensional neural time series lie
on a low-dimensional manifold shaped by simpler underlying dynamics. To uncover
this structure, latent dynamical variable models such as state-space models,
recurrent neural networks, neural ordinary differential equations, and Gaussian
Process Latent Variable Models are widely used. We propose a novel hierarchical
stochastic differential equation (SDE) model that balances computational
efficiency and interpretability, addressing key limitations of existing
methods. Our model assumes the trajectory of a manifold can be reconstructed
from a sparse set of samples from the manifold trajectory. The latent space is
modeled using Brownian bridge SDEs, with points - specified in both time and
value - sampled from a multivariate marked point process. These Brownian
bridges define the drift of a second set of SDEs, which are then mapped to the
observed data. This yields a continuous, differentiable latent process capable
of modeling arbitrarily complex time series as the number of manifold points
increases. We derive training and inference procedures and show that the
computational cost of inference scales linearly with the length of the
observation data. We then validate our model on both synthetic data and neural
recordings to demonstrate that it accurately recovers the underlying manifold
structure and scales effectively with data dimensionality.

Abstract: We demonstrate the effectiveness of using a simple neural network output, a
categorical probability distribution, for the task of next spike prediction.
This case study motivates an investigation into why this simple output
structure is not commonly used with neural temporal point process models. We
find evidence that many existing datasets for evaluating temporal point process
models do not reveal much information about the underlying event generating
processes, and many existing models perform well due to regularization effects
of model size and constraints on output structure. We extend existing datasets
and create new ones in order to explore outside of this information limited
regime and find that outputting a simple categorical distribution is
competitive across a wide range of datasets.

Abstract: Current approaches to genomic sequence modeling often struggle to align the
inductive biases of machine learning models with the evolutionarily-informed
structure of biological systems. To this end, we formulate a novel application
of hyperbolic CNNs that exploits this structure, enabling more expressive DNA
sequence representations. Our strategy circumvents the need for explicit
phylogenetic mapping while discerning key properties of sequences pertaining to
core functional and regulatory behavior. Across 37 out of 42 genome
interpretation benchmark datasets, our hyperbolic models outperform their
Euclidean equivalents. Notably, our approach even surpasses state-of-the-art
performance on seven GUE benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming many
DNA language models while using orders of magnitude fewer parameters and
avoiding pretraining. Our results include a novel set of benchmark
datasets--the Transposable Elements Benchmark--which explores a major but
understudied component of the genome with deep evolutionary significance. We
further motivate our work by exploring how our hyperbolic models recognize
genomic signal under various data-generating conditions and by constructing an
empirical method for interpreting the hyperbolicity of dataset embeddings.
Throughout these assessments, we find persistent evidence highlighting the
potential of our hyperbolic framework as a robust paradigm for genome
representation learning. Our code and benchmark datasets are available at

Conclusion: DGP展示了图增强LLM在欺诈检测中的潜力，有效解决了信息过载问题。

Abstract: Real-world fraud detection applications benefit from graph learning
techniques that jointly exploit node features, often rich in textual data, and
graph structural information. Recently, Graph-Enhanced LLMs emerge as a
promising graph learning approach that converts graph information into prompts,
exploiting LLMs' ability to reason over both textual and structural
information. Among them, text-only prompting, which converts graph information
to prompts consisting solely of text tokens, offers a solution that relies only
on LLM tuning without requiring additional graph-specific encoders. However,
text-only prompting struggles on heterogeneous fraud-detection graphs:
multi-hop relations expand exponentially with each additional hop, leading to
rapidly growing neighborhoods associated with dense textual information. These
neighborhoods may overwhelm the model with long, irrelevant content in the
prompt and suppress key signals from the target node, thereby degrading
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Dual Granularity Prompting
(DGP), which mitigates information overload by preserving fine-grained textual
details for the target node while summarizing neighbor information into
coarse-grained text prompts. DGP introduces tailored summarization strategies
for different data modalities, bi-level semantic abstraction for textual fields
and statistical aggregation for numerical features, enabling effective
compression of verbose neighbor content into concise, informative prompts.
Experiments across public and industrial datasets demonstrate that DGP operates
within a manageable token budget while improving fraud detection performance by
up to 6.8% (AUPRC) over state-of-the-art methods, showing the potential of
Graph-Enhanced LLMs for fraud detection.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is often viewed as a powerful data analysis tool that
is easy to learn because of its black-box nature. Yet this very nature also
makes it difficult to quantify confidence in predictions extracted from ML
models, and more fundamentally, to understand how such models are mathematical
abstractions of training data. The goal of this paper is to unravel these
issues and their connections to uncertainty quantification (UQ) by pursuing a
line of reasoning motivated by diagnostics. In such settings, prevalence - i.e.
the fraction of elements in class - is often of inherent interest. Here we
analyze the many interpretations of prevalence to derive a level-set theory of
classification, which shows that certain types of self-consistent ML models are
equivalent to class-conditional probability distributions. We begin by studying
the properties of binary Bayes optimal classifiers, recognizing that their
boundary sets can be reinterpreted as level-sets of pairwise density ratios. By
parameterizing Bayes classifiers in terms of the prevalence, we then show that
they satisfy important monotonicity and class-switching properties that can be
used to deduce the density ratios without direct access to the boundary sets.
Moreover, this information is sufficient for tasks such as constructing the
multiclass Bayes-optimal classifier and estimating inherent uncertainty in the
class assignments. In the multiclass case, we use these results to deduce
normalization and self-consistency conditions, the latter being equivalent to
the law of total probability for classifiers. We also show that these are
necessary conditions for arbitrary ML models to have valid probabilistic
interpretations. Throughout we demonstrate how this analysis informs the
broader task of UQ for ML via an uncertainty propagation framework.

Abstract: Accurately forecasting commodity demand remains a critical challenge due to
volatile market dynamics, nonlinear dependencies, and the need for economically
consistent predictions. This paper introduces PREIG, a novel deep learning
framework tailored for commodity demand forecasting. The model uniquely
integrates a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architecture with physics-informed
neural network (PINN) principles by embedding a domain-specific economic
constraint: the negative elasticity between price and demand. This constraint
is enforced through a customized loss function that penalizes violations of the
physical rule, ensuring that model predictions remain interpretable and aligned
with economic theory. To further enhance predictive performance and stability,
PREIG incorporates a hybrid optimization strategy that couples NAdam and L-BFGS
with Population-Based Training (POP). Experiments across multiple commodities
datasets demonstrate that PREIG significantly outperforms traditional
econometric models (ARIMA,GARCH) and deep learning baselines (BPNN,RNN) in both
RMSE and MAPE. When compared with GRU,PREIG maintains good explainability while
still performing well in prediction. By bridging domain knowledge, optimization
theory and deep learning, PREIG provides a robust, interpretable, and scalable
solution for high-dimensional nonlinear time series forecasting in economy.

Abstract: Hydrofluoroolefins are considered the most promising next-generation
refrigerants due to their extremely low global warming potential values, which
can effectively mitigate the global warming effect. However, the lack of
reliable thermodynamic data hinders the discovery and application of newer and
superior hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants. In this work, integrating the
strengths of theoretical method and data-driven method, we proposed a neural
network extended corresponding state model to predict the residual
thermodynamic properties of hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants. The innovation is
that the fluids are characterized through their microscopic molecular
structures by the inclusion of graph neural network module and the specialized
design of model architecture to enhance its generalization ability. The
proposed model is trained using the highly accurate data of available known
fluids, and evaluated via the leave-one-out cross-validation method. Compared
to conventional extended corresponding state models or cubic equation of state,
the proposed model shows significantly improved accuracy for density and energy
properties in liquid and supercritical regions, with average absolute deviation
of 1.49% (liquid) and 2.42% (supercritical) for density, 3.37% and 2.50% for
residual entropy, 1.85% and 1.34% for residual enthalpy. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of embedding physics knowledge into the machine
learning model. The proposed neural network extended corresponding state model
is expected to significantly accelerate the discovery of novel
hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants.

Conclusion: ZS-PAG在零样本遗忘场景中有效防止过遗忘并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific samples from a
trained model. A key challenge in this process is over-unlearning, where the
model's performance on the remaining data significantly drops due to the change
in the model's parameters. Existing unlearning algorithms depend on the
remaining data to prevent this issue. As such, these methods are inapplicable
in a more practical scenario, where only the unlearning samples are available
(i.e., zero-shot unlearning). This paper presents a novel framework, ZS-PAG, to
fill this gap. Our approach offers three key innovations: (1) we approximate
the inaccessible remaining data by generating adversarial samples; (2)
leveraging the generated samples, we pinpoint a specific subspace to perform
the unlearning process, therefore preventing over-unlearning in the challenging
zero-shot scenario; and (3) we consider the influence of the unlearning process
on the remaining samples and design an influence-based pseudo-labeling
strategy. As a result, our method further improves the model's performance
after unlearning. The proposed method holds a theoretical guarantee, and
experiments on various benchmarks validate the effectiveness and superiority of
our proposed method over several baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 材料科学需要跨学科整合，尤其是实验与理论的结合，以实现从性能需求逆向优化材料微结构和制造路径的目标。

Method: 采用可微分物理框架evoxels，结合高分辨率成像、预测模拟和数据驱动优化，实现处理-结构-性能关系的深入理解。

Result: 通过evoxels框架，成功整合了多种技术，加速了材料发现和逆向设计过程。

Conclusion: evoxels框架为材料科学中的跨学科整合和逆向设计提供了高效工具，推动了处理-结构-性能关系的研究。

Abstract: Materials science inherently spans disciplines: experimentalists use advanced
microscopy to uncover micro- and nanoscale structure, while theorists and
computational scientists develop models that link processing, structure, and
properties. Bridging these domains is essential for inverse material design
where you start from desired performance and work backwards to optimal
microstructures and manufacturing routes. Integrating high-resolution imaging
with predictive simulations and data-driven optimization accelerates discovery
and deepens understanding of process-structure-property relationships. The
differentiable physics framework evoxels is based on a fully Pythonic, unified
voxel-based approach that integrates segmented 3D microscopy data, physical
simulations, inverse modeling, and machine learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TempRe是一个生成框架，将基于模板的方法重新表述为序列生成，实现了可扩展、灵活且化学上合理的逆合成分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逆合成规划因化学反应空间的复杂性和广泛性而具有挑战性，传统方法存在可扩展性和泛化性不足的问题。

Method: TempRe将基于模板的方法转化为序列生成，支持单步和多步逆合成任务。

Result: 在PaRoutes多步基准测试中，TempRe表现出色，优于模板分类和SMILES生成方法。

Conclusion: 模板生成建模在计算机辅助合成规划中具有潜力。

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning remains a central challenge in molecular discovery
due to the vast and complex chemical reaction space. While traditional
template-based methods offer tractability, they suffer from poor scalability
and limited generalization, and template-free generative approaches risk
generating invalid reactions. In this work, we propose TempRe, a generative
framework that reformulates template-based approaches as sequence generation,
enabling scalable, flexible, and chemically plausible retrosynthesis. We
evaluated TempRe across single-step and multi-step retrosynthesis tasks,
demonstrating its superiority over both template classification and
SMILES-based generation methods. On the PaRoutes multi-step benchmark, TempRe
achieves strong top-k route accuracy. Furthermore, we extend TempRe to direct
multi-step synthesis route generation, providing a lightweight and efficient
alternative to conventional single-step and search-based approaches. These
results highlight the potential of template generative modeling as a powerful
paradigm in computer-aided synthesis planning.

*Xie Zhang,Yina Wang,Chenshu Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RF-CRATE是一种数学可解释的深度网络架构，用于射频（RF）传感，基于复杂稀疏率降低原理，性能与黑盒模型相当，同时提供完全的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度无线传感（DWS）模型多为黑盒，缺乏可解释性，限制了其通用性和在安全敏感应用中的可靠性。

Method: 通过非平凡的理论推导，将实值白盒Transformer扩展到复数域，并引入子空间正则化增强特征多样性。

Result: RF-CRATE在多个传感任务中平均性能提升19.98%，分类增益5.08%，回归误差降低10.34%。

Conclusion: RF-CRATE不仅性能优越，还提供了数学可解释性，为RF传感领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The empirical success of deep learning has spurred its application to the
radio-frequency (RF) domain, leading to significant advances in Deep Wireless
Sensing (DWS). However, most existing DWS models function as black boxes with
limited interpretability, which hampers their generalizability and raises
concerns in security-sensitive physical applications. In this work, inspired by
the remarkable advances of white-box transformers, we present RF-CRATE, the
first mathematically interpretable deep network architecture for RF sensing,
grounded in the principles of complex sparse rate reduction. To accommodate the
unique RF signals, we conduct non-trivial theoretical derivations that extend
the original real-valued white-box transformer to the complex domain. By
leveraging the CR-Calculus framework, we successfully construct a fully
complex-valued white-box transformer with theoretically derived self-attention
and residual multi-layer perceptron modules. Furthermore, to improve the
model's ability to extract discriminative features from limited wireless data,
we introduce Subspace Regularization, a novel regularization strategy that
enhances feature diversity, resulting in an average performance improvement of
19.98% across multiple sensing tasks. We extensively evaluate RF-CRATE against
seven baselines with multiple public and self-collected datasets involving
different RF signals. The results show that RF-CRATE achieves performance on
par with thoroughly engineered black-box models, while offering full
mathematical interpretability. More importantly, by extending CRATE to the
complex domain, RF-CRATE yields substantial improvements, achieving an average
classification gain of 5.08% and reducing regression error by 10.34% across
diverse sensing tasks compared to CRATE. RF-CRATE is fully open-sourced at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨了利用贝叶斯优化（BO）优化碳捕集与封存（CCS）项目决策变量的方法，比较了多种随机模型，旨在提升CCS的经济可行性和可持续性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CCS技术对可持续发展至关重要，但需要优化决策变量以提高其经济性和效率。本文旨在探索贝叶斯优化在CCS项目中的应用潜力。

Method: 采用贝叶斯优化框架，比较了高斯过程（GPs）和其他新型随机模型，特别关注多决策变量和多目标函数的情况。

Result: 研究表明，在GPs表现不佳的场景中，更复杂的随机模型能有效提升优化效果，同时通过净现值（NPV）目标函数增强经济可行性。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯优化在CCS项目中有显著潜力，为能源行业的可持续发展提供了一种新方法。

Abstract: Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) stands as a pivotal technology for fostering
a sustainable future. The process, which involves injecting supercritical
CO$_2$ into underground formations, a method already widely used for Enhanced
Oil Recovery, serves a dual purpose: it not only curbs CO$_2$ emissions and
addresses climate change but also extends the operational lifespan and
sustainability of oil fields and platforms, easing the shift toward greener
practices. This paper delivers a thorough comparative evaluation of strategies
for optimizing decision variables in CCS project development, employing a
derivative-free technique known as Bayesian Optimization. In addition to
Gaussian Processes, which usually serve as the gold standard in BO, various
novel stochastic models were examined and compared within a BO framework. This
research investigates the effectiveness of utilizing more exotic stochastic
models than GPs for BO in environments where GPs have been shown to
underperform, such as in cases with a large number of decision variables or
multiple objective functions that are not similarly scaled. By incorporating
Net Present Value (NPV) as a key objective function, the proposed framework
demonstrates its potential to improve economic viability while ensuring the
sustainable deployment of CCS technologies. Ultimately, this study represents
the first application in the reservoir engineering industry of the growing body
of BO research, specifically in the search for more appropriate stochastic
models, highlighting its potential as a preferred method for enhancing
sustainability in the energy sector.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FNOs作为高维偏微分方程的替代模型，其稳定性、泛化性和频率行为缺乏理论解释，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过无限维函数空间中的有效场论分析，推导了层核和四点顶点的闭合递推关系，并研究了三种重要设置：解析激活、尺度不变性和残差连接架构。

Result: 理论和实验表明，非线性激活会耦合频率输入到高频模式，且权重初始化的临界条件能保持输入扰动在深度上的均匀尺度。

Conclusion: 研究量化了非线性如何帮助神经算子捕捉非平凡特征，提供了超参数选择的临界分析标准，并解释了尺度不变激活和残差连接如何增强FNOs的特征学习。

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have emerged as leading surrogates for
high-dimensional partial-differential equations, yet their stability,
generalization and frequency behavior lack a principled explanation. We present
the first systematic effective-field-theory analysis of FNOs in an
infinite-dimensional function space, deriving closed recursion relations for
the layer kernel and four-point vertex and then examining three practically
important settings-analytic activations, scale-invariant cases and
architectures with residual connections. The theory shows that nonlinear
activations inevitably couple frequency inputs to high-frequency modes that are
otherwise discarded by spectral truncation, and experiments confirm this
frequency transfer. For wide networks we obtain explicit criticality conditions
on the weight-initialization ensemble that keep small input perturbations to
have uniform scale across depth, and empirical tests validate these
predictions. Taken together, our results quantify how nonlinearity enables
neural operators to capture non-trivial features, supply criteria for
hyper-parameter selection via criticality analysis, and explain why
scale-invariant activations and residual connections enhance feature learning
in FNOs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督参数估计方法，通过近似通解和样条变换，高精度地发现稀疏且物理可解释的ODE模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据驱动方法缺乏物理意义和可解释性，难以反映真实物理系统。

Method: 先找到近似通解，再通过样条变换线性估计ODE系数，利用梯度矩阵求解。

Result: 方法能高精度发现稀疏ODE模型，对噪声数据鲁棒。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于真实实验环境，推动数据驱动技术在物理现象学习中的应用。

Abstract: The data-driven discovery of interpretable models approximating the
underlying dynamics of a physical system has gained attraction in the past
decade. Current approaches employ pre-specified functional forms or basis
functions and often result in models that lack physical meaning and
interpretability, let alone represent the true physics of the system. We
propose an unsupervised parameter estimation methodology that first finds an
approximate general solution, followed by a spline transformation to linearly
estimate the coefficients of the governing ordinary differential equation
(ODE). The approximate general solution is postulated using the same functional
form as the analytical solution of a general homogeneous, linear,
constant-coefficient ODE. An added advantage is its ability to produce a
high-fidelity, smooth functional form even in the presence of noisy data. The
spline approximation obtains gradient information from the functional form
which are linearly independent and creates the basis of the gradient matrix.
This gradient matrix is used in a linear system to find the coefficients of the
ODEs. From the case studies, we observed that our modeling approach discovers
ODEs with high accuracy and also promotes sparsity in the solution without
using any regularization techniques. The methodology is also robust to noisy
data and thus allows the integration of data-driven techniques into real
experimental setting for data-driven learning of physical phenomena.

*Zhuokun Chen,Zeren Chen,Jiahao He,Mingkui Tan,Jianfei Cai,Bohan Zhuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: R-Stitch通过在小语言模型（SLM）和大语言模型（LLM）之间动态切换，加速链式思维（CoT）推理，减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有加速方法（如推测解码）在小模型和大模型一致性低时效果有限，且未充分利用小模型生成简洁中间推理的优势。

Method: R-Stitch采用基于置信度的混合解码框架，默认使用SLM生成令牌，仅在SLM置信度低于阈值时调用LLM。

Result: 实验表明，R-Stitch在数学推理基准测试中推理延迟降低85%，准确率几乎无下降。

Conclusion: R-Stitch是一种无需训练、模型无关的高效CoT推理加速方法。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving capabilities of
large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning during
inference. While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead
due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences.
Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early
stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via
speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers
from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low,
and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing
concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a
token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT
inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large
language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to
generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's
confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback
and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency
and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible
with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\% reduction in inference latency
with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in
accelerating CoT reasoning.

Conclusion: 需改进数据预处理以提高预测可靠性。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a main cause of mortality globally,
accounting for 31% of all deaths. This study involves a cardiovascular disease
(CVD) dataset comprising 68,119 records to explore the influence of numerical
(age, height, weight, blood pressure, BMI) and categorical gender, cholesterol,
glucose, smoking, alcohol, activity) factors on CVD occurrence. We have
performed statistical analyses, including t-tests, Chi-square tests, and ANOVA,
to identify strong associations between CVD and elderly people, hypertension,
higher weight, and abnormal cholesterol levels, while physical activity (a
protective factor). A logistic regression model highlights age, blood pressure,
and cholesterol as primary risk factors, with unexpected negative associations
for smoking and alcohol, suggesting potential data issues. Model performance
comparisons reveal CatBoost as the top performer with an accuracy of 0.734 and
an ECE of 0.0064 and excels in probabilistic prediction (Brier score = 0.1824).
Data challenges, including outliers and skewed distributions, indicate a need
for improved preprocessing to enhance predictive reliability.

Conclusion: DynamicMPNN在多状态蛋白质设计中表现优异，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Structural biology has long been dominated by the one sequence, one
structure, one function paradigm, yet many critical biological processes - from
enzyme catalysis to membrane transport - depend on proteins that adopt multiple
conformational states. Existing multi-state design approaches rely on post-hoc
aggregation of single-state predictions, achieving poor experimental success
rates compared to single-state design. We introduce DynamicMPNN, an inverse
folding model explicitly trained to generate sequences compatible with multiple
conformations through joint learning across conformational ensembles. Trained
on 46,033 conformational pairs covering 75% of CATH superfamilies and evaluated
using AlphaFold initial guess, DynamicMPNN outperforms ProteinMPNN by up to 13%
on structure-normalized RMSD across our challenging multi-state protein
benchmark.

Abstract: Cloud computing offers on-demand resource access, regulated by Service-Level
Agreements (SLAs) between consumers and Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). SLA
violations can impact efficiency and CSP profitability. In this work, we
propose an SLA-aware automated algorithm-selection framework for combinatorial
optimization problems in resource-constrained cloud environments. The framework
uses an ensemble of machine learning models to predict performance and rank
algorithm-hardware pairs based on SLA constraints. We also apply our framework
to the 0-1 knapsack problem. We curate a dataset comprising instance specific
features along with memory usage, runtime, and optimality gap for 6 algorithms.
As an empirical benchmark, we evaluate the framework on both classification and
regression tasks. Our ablation study explores the impact of hyperparameters,
learning approaches, and large language models effectiveness in regression, and
SHAP-based interpretability.

Motivation: 探索强化学习后训练对LLMs在实际任务中的经济价值，填补相关研究的空白。

Method: 提出RLPF方法，利用历史广告表现数据作为奖励信号，训练模型AdLlama，并通过A/B测试验证效果。

Result: AdLlama将点击率提升6.7%，广告主满意度提高，生成更多广告变体。

Conclusion: RLPF是一种有前景的后训练方法，能显著提升语言模型的实际效果。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI), in particular large language models
(LLMs), is poised to drive transformative economic change. LLMs are pre-trained
on vast text data to learn general language patterns, but a subsequent
post-training phase is critical to align them for specific real-world tasks.
Reinforcement learning (RL) is the leading post-training technique, yet its
economic impact remains largely underexplored and unquantified. We examine this
question through the lens of the first deployment of an RL-trained LLM for
generative advertising on Facebook. Integrated into Meta's Text Generation
feature, our model, "AdLlama," powers an AI tool that helps advertisers create
new variations of human-written ad text. To train this model, we introduce
reinforcement learning with performance feedback (RLPF), a post-training method
that uses historical ad performance data as a reward signal. In a large-scale
10-week A/B test on Facebook spanning nearly 35,000 advertisers and 640,000 ad
variations, we find that AdLlama improves click-through rates by 6.7%
(p=0.0296) compared to a supervised imitation model trained on curated ads.
This represents a substantial improvement in advertiser return on investment on
Facebook. We also find that advertisers who used AdLlama generated more ad
variations, indicating higher satisfaction with the model's outputs. To our
knowledge, this is the largest study to date on the use of generative AI in an
ecologically valid setting, offering an important data point quantifying the
tangible impact of RL post-training. Furthermore, the results show that RLPF is
a promising and generalizable approach for metric-driven post-training that
bridges the gap between highly capable language models and tangible outcomes.

Result: 学生模型生成的对抗样本攻击成功率与集成基线相当，生成时间减少六倍；低温和硬标签监督显著提升可迁移性。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏不仅是模型压缩技术，还能高效提升黑盒对抗攻击效果。

Abstract: We investigate whether knowledge distillation (KD) from multiple
heterogeneous teacher models can enhance the generation of transferable
adversarial examples. A lightweight student model is trained using two KD
strategies: curriculum-based switching and joint optimization, with ResNet50
and DenseNet-161 as teachers. The trained student is then used to generate
adversarial examples using FG, FGS, and PGD attacks, which are evaluated
against a black-box target model (GoogLeNet). Our results show that student
models distilled from multiple teachers achieve attack success rates comparable
to ensemble-based baselines, while reducing adversarial example generation time
by up to a factor of six. An ablation study further reveals that lower
temperature settings and the inclusion of hard-label supervision significantly
enhance transferability. These findings suggest that KD can serve not only as a
model compression technique but also as a powerful tool for improving the
efficiency and effectiveness of black-box adversarial attacks.

Abstract: This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for identifying honey
floral and geographical sources using mineral element profiles. The proposed
method comprises two steps: preprocessing and classification. The preprocessing
phase involves missing-value treatment and data normalization. In the
classification phase, we employ various supervised classification models for
discriminating between six botanical sources and 13 geographical origins of
honey. We test the classifiers' performance on a publicly available honey
mineral element dataset. The dataset contains mineral element profiles of
honeys from various floral and geographical origins. Results show that mineral
element content in honey provides discriminative information useful for
classifying honey botanical and geographical sources. Results also show that
the Random Forests (RF) classifier obtains the best performance on this
dataset, achieving a cross-validation accuracy of 99.30% for classifying honey
botanical origins and 98.01% for classifying honey geographical origins.

Conclusion: DRL在库存管理中具有实际应用潜力，结合传统方法可提升策略的稳健性和可解释性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
to classical inventory management problems, with a focus on practical
implementation considerations. We apply a DRL algorithm based on DirectBackprop
to several fundamental inventory management scenarios including multi-period
systems with lost sales (with and without lead times), perishable inventory
management, dual sourcing, and joint inventory procurement and removal. The DRL
approach learns policies across products using only historical information that
would be available in practice, avoiding unrealistic assumptions about demand
distributions or access to distribution parameters. We demonstrate that our
generic DRL implementation performs competitively against or outperforms
established benchmarks and heuristics across these diverse settings, while
requiring minimal parameter tuning. Through examination of the learned
policies, we show that the DRL approach naturally captures many known
structural properties of optimal policies derived from traditional operations
research methods. To further improve policy performance and interpretability,
we propose a Structure-Informed Policy Network technique that explicitly
incorporates analytically-derived characteristics of optimal policies into the
learning process. This approach can help interpretability and add robustness to
the policy in out-of-sample performance, as we demonstrate in an example with
realistic demand data. Finally, we provide an illustrative application of DRL
in a non-stationary setting. Our work bridges the gap between data-driven
learning and analytical insights in inventory management while maintaining
practical applicability.

Method: 采用多项式基函数（如单项式和Legendre多项式）参数化权重，并在神经ODE和ResNet架构中评估其性能。

Result: Legendre多项式基在训练稳定性、计算成本和准确性上优于单项式基和无约束权重模型。

Conclusion: 正交多项式基（如Legendre）在模型表达能力和训练效率之间提供了更好的平衡。

Abstract: Continuous-time deep learning models, such as neural ordinary differential
equations (ODEs), offer a promising framework for surrogate modeling of complex
physical systems. A central challenge in training these models lies in learning
expressive yet stable time-varying weights, particularly under computational
constraints. This work investigates weight parameterization strategies that
constrain the temporal evolution of weights to a low-dimensional subspace
spanned by polynomial basis functions. We evaluate both monomial and Legendre
polynomial bases within neural ODE and residual network (ResNet) architectures
under discretize-then-optimize and optimize-then-discretize training paradigms.
Experimental results across three high-dimensional benchmark problems show that
Legendre parameterizations yield more stable training dynamics, reduce
computational cost, and achieve accuracy comparable to or better than both
monomial parameterizations and unconstrained weight models. These findings
elucidate the role of basis choice in time-dependent weight parameterization
and demonstrate that using orthogonal polynomial bases offers a favorable
tradeoff between model expressivity and training efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate demand forecasting is critical for supply chain optimization, yet

rigidity and limited robustness under distributional change. In this paper, we
propose a unified ensemble framework that enhances the performance of
foundation models for sales forecasting in real-world supply chains. Our method
combines two complementary strategies: (1) Hierarchical Ensemble (HE), which
partitions training and inference by semantic levels (e.g., store, category,
department) to capture localized patterns; and (2) Architectural Ensemble (AE),
which integrates predictions from diverse model backbones to mitigate bias and
improve stability. We conduct extensive experiments on the M5 benchmark and
three external sales datasets, covering both in-domain and zero-shot
forecasting. Results show that our approach consistently outperforms strong
baselines, improves accuracy across hierarchical levels, and provides a simple
yet effective mechanism for boosting generalization in complex forecasting
environments.

TL;DR: iHOMER是一种在线多标签学习框架，通过动态聚类和漂移检测机制解决数据流中的多标签分类问题，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多标签数据流中存在分布演化、高维标签空间、稀疏标签和复杂标签依赖等问题，且概念漂移影响标签相关性和不平衡比例，需要动态适应方法。

Method: iHOMER通过在线分裂-聚合聚类和全局树学习器动态划分标签空间，并集成漂移检测机制。

Result: 在23个真实数据集上，iHOMER比5种全局基线方法性能提升23%，比12种局部基线方法提升32%。

Conclusion: iHOMER是一种鲁棒的在线多标签分类框架，适用于动态数据流环境。

Abstract: Mining data streams with multi-label outputs poses significant challenges due
to evolving distributions, high-dimensional label spaces, sparse label
occurrences, and complex label dependencies. Moreover, concept drift affects
not only input distributions but also label correlations and imbalance ratios
over time, complicating model adaptation. To address these challenges,
structured learners are categorized into local and global methods. Local
methods break down the task into simpler components, while global methods adapt
the algorithm to the full output space, potentially yielding better predictions
by exploiting label correlations. This work introduces iHOMER (Incremental
Hierarchy Of Multi-label Classifiers), an online multi-label learning framework
that incrementally partitions the label space into disjoint, correlated
clusters without relying on predefined hierarchies. iHOMER leverages online
divisive-agglomerative clustering based on \textit{Jaccard} similarity and a
global tree-based learner driven by a multivariate \textit{Bernoulli} process
to guide instance partitioning. To address non-stationarity, it integrates
drift detection mechanisms at both global and local levels, enabling dynamic
restructuring of label partitions and subtrees. Experiments across 23
real-world datasets show iHOMER outperforms 5 state-of-the-art global
baselines, such as MLHAT, MLHT of Pruned Sets and iSOUPT, by 23\%, and 12 local
baselines, such as binary relevance transformations of kNN, EFDT, ARF, and
ADWIN bagging/boosting ensembles, by 32\%, establishing its robustness for
online multi-label classification.

TL;DR: ST-DAI是一个单次框架，通过2.5D采样和域自适应插值，显著降低3D空间转录组学的成本，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D空间转录组学中全采样成本高的问题，避免依赖外部数据集导致的领域差异和泛化问题。

Method: 采用2.5D采样（中心全采样，相邻稀疏采样），结合单次3D插值学习和域自适应技术（FMDR和PDLs）。

Result: ST-DAI在性能上与全采样方法相当，同时大幅降低测量负担。

Conclusion: ST-DAI提供了一种高效且经济的3D空间转录组学解决方案。

Abstract: For 3D spatial transcriptomics (ST), the high per-section acquisition cost of
fully sampling every tissue section remains a significant challenge. Although
recent approaches predict gene expression from histology images, these methods
require large external datasets, which leads to high-cost and suffers from
substantial domain discrepancies that lead to poor generalization on new
samples. In this work, we introduce ST-DAI, a single-shot framework for 3D ST
that couples a cost-efficient 2.5D sampling scheme with an intra-sample
domain-adaptive imputation framework. First, in the cost-efficient 2.5D
sampling stage, one reference section (central section) is fully sampled while
other sections (adjacent sections) is sparsely sampled, thereby capturing
volumetric context at significantly reduced experimental cost. Second, we
propose a single-shot 3D imputation learning method that allows us to generate
fully sampled 3D ST from this cost-efficient 2.5D ST scheme, using only
sample-specific training. We observe position misalignment and domain
discrepancy between sections. To address those issues, we adopt a pipeline that
first aligns the central section to the adjacent section, thereafter generates
dense pseudo-supervision on the central section, and then performs Fast
Multi-Domain Refinement (FMDR), which adapts the network to the domain of the
adjacent section while fine-tuning only a few parameters through the use of
Parameter-Efficient Domain-Alignment Layers (PDLs). During this refinement, a
Confidence Score Generator (CSG) reweights the pseudo-labels according to their
estimated reliability, thereby directing imputation toward trustworthy regions.
Our experimental results demonstrate that ST-DAI achieves gene expression
prediction performance comparable to fully sampled approaches while
substantially reducing the measurement burden.

TL;DR: 论文提出VidFuncta框架，利用隐式神经表示（INRs）分析超声视频，解决了传统深度学习方法的局限性，并在多个任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声视频分析因非标准化采集和操作者偏差而具有挑战性，传统深度学习方法难以处理。

Method: 基于Functa框架，提出VidFuncta，将超声视频编码为紧凑的时变表示，分离静态和时间相关向量。

Result: 在视频重建和下游任务（如射血分数预测、B线检测和乳腺病变分类）中优于2D和3D基线方法。

Conclusion: VidFuncta是一种通用且高效的超声视频表示框架，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Ultrasound is widely used in clinical care, yet standard deep learning
methods often struggle with full video analysis due to non-standardized
acquisition and operator bias. We offer a new perspective on ultrasound video
analysis through implicit neural representations (INRs). We build on Functa, an
INR framework in which each image is represented by a modulation vector that
conditions a shared neural network. However, its extension to the temporal
domain of medical videos remains unexplored. To address this gap, we propose
VidFuncta, a novel framework that leverages Functa to encode variable-length
ultrasound videos into compact, time-resolved representations. VidFuncta
disentangles each video into a static video-specific vector and a sequence of
time-dependent modulation vectors, capturing both temporal dynamics and
dataset-level redundancies. Our method outperforms 2D and 3D baselines on video
reconstruction and enables downstream tasks to directly operate on the learned
1D modulation vectors. We validate VidFuncta on three public ultrasound video
datasets -- cardiac, lung, and breast -- and evaluate its downstream
performance on ejection fraction prediction, B-line detection, and breast
lesion classification. These results highlight the potential of VidFuncta as a
generalizable and efficient representation framework for ultrasound videos. Our
code is publicly available under

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is projected to become the second-deadliest malignancy in
Western countries by 2030, highlighting the urgent need for better early
detection. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), key precursors to
pancreatic cancer, are challenging to assess with current guidelines, often
leading to unnecessary surgeries or missed malignancies. We present Cyst-X, an
AI framework that predicts IPMN malignancy using multicenter MRI data,
leveraging MRI's superior soft tissue contrast over CT. Trained on 723 T1- and
738 T2-weighted scans from 764 patients across seven institutions, our models
(AUC=0.82) significantly outperform both Kyoto guidelines (AUC=0.75) and expert
radiologists. The AI-derived imaging features align with known clinical markers
and offer biologically meaningful insights. We also demonstrate strong
performance in a federated learning setting, enabling collaborative training
without sharing patient data. To promote privacy-preserving AI development and
improve IPMN risk stratification, the Cyst-X dataset is released as the first
large-scale, multi-center pancreatic cysts MRI dataset.

Motivation: 尽管基础模型在医学领域显示出潜力，但在复杂心血管诊断中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用两阶段预训练策略：第一阶段使用3D掩码自编码器（MAE）进行自监督表示学习；第二阶段引入对比学习对齐视觉和文本表示。

Result: Cardiac-CLIP在内部和外部数据中均表现出色，尤其在急性冠脉综合征的前瞻性预测等复杂任务中效果显著。

Conclusion: Cardiac-CLIP为心血管诊断提供了高效的多模态基础模型，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable potential in medical domain.
However, their application to complex cardiovascular diagnostics remains
underexplored. In this paper, we present Cardiac-CLIP, a multi-modal foundation
model designed for 3D cardiac CT images. Cardiac-CLIP is developed through a
two-stage pre-training strategy. The first stage employs a 3D masked
autoencoder (MAE) to perform self-supervised representation learning from
large-scale unlabeled volumetric data, enabling the visual encoder to capture
rich anatomical and contextual features. In the second stage, contrastive
learning is introduced to align visual and textual representations,
facilitating cross-modal understanding. To support the pre-training, we collect
16641 real clinical CT scans, supplemented by 114k publicly available data.
Meanwhile, we standardize free-text radiology reports into unified templates
and construct the pathology vectors according to diagnostic attributes, based
on which the soft-label matrix is generated to supervise the contrastive
learning process. On the other hand, to comprehensively evaluate the
effectiveness of Cardiac-CLIP, we collect 6,722 real-clinical data from 12
independent institutions, along with the open-source data to construct the
evaluation dataset. Specifically, Cardiac-CLIP is comprehensively evaluated
across multiple tasks, including cardiovascular abnormality classification,
information retrieval and clinical analysis. Experimental results demonstrate
that Cardiac-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
downstream tasks in both internal and external data. Particularly, Cardiac-CLIP
exhibits great effectiveness in supporting complex clinical tasks such as the
prospective prediction of acute coronary syndrome, which is notoriously
difficult in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: ReXGroundingCT为胸部CT中的句子级定位和自由文本医学分割模型提供了新的开发和评估标准。

Abstract: We present ReXGroundingCT, the first publicly available dataset to link
free-text radiology findings with pixel-level segmentations in 3D chest CT
scans that is manually annotated. While prior datasets have relied on
structured labels or predefined categories, ReXGroundingCT captures the full
expressiveness of clinical language represented in free text and grounds it to
spatially localized 3D segmentation annotations in volumetric imaging. This
addresses a critical gap in medical AI: the ability to connect complex,
descriptive text, such as "3 mm nodule in the left lower lobe", to its precise
anatomical location in three-dimensional space, a capability essential for
grounded radiology report generation systems. The dataset comprises 3,142
non-contrast chest CT scans paired with standardized radiology reports from the
CT-RATE dataset. Using a systematic three-stage pipeline, GPT-4 was used to
extract positive lung and pleural findings, which were then manually segmented
by expert annotators. A total of 8,028 findings across 16,301 entities were
annotated, with quality control performed by board-certified radiologists.
Approximately 79% of findings are focal abnormalities, while 21% are non-focal.
The training set includes up to three representative segmentations per finding,
while the validation and test sets contain exhaustive labels for each finding
entity. ReXGroundingCT establishes a new benchmark for developing and
evaluating sentence-level grounding and free-text medical segmentation models
in chest CT. The dataset can be accessed at

Method: 结合梯度U-Net（GU-Net）和条件生成对抗网络（rcGAN），利用Wasserstein GAN提升训练稳定性，并引入正则化项防止模式崩溃。

Result: RI-GAN能高效生成高质量重建图像，适应不同动态范围，并提供不确定性量化。

Conclusion: 该方法为下一代射电望远镜提供了计算高效、可扩展且具有不确定性感知的成像技术。

Abstract: With the rise of large radio interferometric telescopes, particularly the
SKA, there is a growing demand for computationally efficient image
reconstruction techniques. Existing reconstruction methods, such as the CLEAN
algorithm or proximal optimisation approaches, are iterative in nature,
necessitating a large amount of compute. These methods either provide no
uncertainty quantification or require large computational overhead to do so.
Learned reconstruction methods have shown promise in providing efficient and
high quality reconstruction. In this article we explore the use of generative
neural networks that enable efficient approximate sampling of the posterior
distribution for high quality reconstructions with uncertainty quantification.
Our RI-GAN framework, builds on the regularised conditional generative
adversarial network (rcGAN) framework by integrating a gradient U-Net (GU-Net)
architecture - a hybrid reconstruction model that embeds the measurement
operator directly into the network. This framework uses Wasserstein GANs to
improve training stability in combination with regularisation terms that combat
mode collapse, which are typical problems for conditional GANs. This approach
takes as input the dirty image and the point spread function (PSF) of the
observation and provides efficient, high-quality image reconstructions that are
robust to varying visibility coverages, generalises to images with an increased
dynamic range, and provides informative uncertainty quantification. Our methods
provide a significant step toward computationally efficient, scalable, and
uncertainty-aware imaging for next-generation radio telescopes.

Result: DLRS显著加速了训练过程并提高了稳定性。

Conclusion: 动态学习率调度器（DLRS）是一种有效的工具，可优化神经网络的训练过程。

Abstract: Training neural networks can be challenging, especially as the complexity of
the problem increases. Despite using wider or deeper networks, training them
can be a tedious process, especially if a wrong choice of the hyperparameter is
made. The learning rate is one of such crucial hyperparameters, which is
usually kept static during the training process. Learning dynamics in complex
systems often requires a more adaptive approach to the learning rate. This
adaptability becomes crucial to effectively navigate varying gradients and
optimize the learning process during the training process. In this paper, a
dynamic learning rate scheduler (DLRS) algorithm is presented that adapts the
learning rate based on the loss values calculated during the training process.
Experiments are conducted on problems related to physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs) and image classification using multilayer perceptrons and
convolutional neural networks, respectively. The results demonstrate that the
proposed DLRS accelerates training and improves stability.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior and evolution of a dynamical many-body system by
analyzing patterns in their experimentally captured images is a promising
method relevant for a variety of living and non-living self-assembled systems.
The arrays of moving liquid crystal skyrmions studied here are a representative
example of hierarchically organized materials that exhibit complex
spatiotemporal dynamics driven by multiscale processes. Joint geometric and
topological data analysis (TDA) offers a powerful framework for investigating
such systems by capturing the underlying structure of the data at multiple
scales. In the TDA approach, we introduce the $\Psi$-function, a robust
numerical topological descriptor related to both the spatiotemporal changes in
the size and shape of individual topological solitons and the emergence of
regions with their different spatial organization. The geometric method based
on the analysis of vector fields generated from images of skyrmion ensembles
offers insights into the nonlinear physical mechanisms of the system's response
to external stimuli and provides a basis for comparison with theoretical
predictions. The methodology presented here is very general and can provide a
characterization of system behavior both at the level of individual
pattern-forming agents and as a whole, allowing one to relate the results of
image data analysis to processes occurring in a physical, chemical, or
biological system in the real world.

Motivation: 传统方法在解决PDEs中的空间变化系数问题时效率低下且缺乏可解释性，DeepFDM旨在提供一种高效、稳定且透明的解决方案。

Method: DeepFDM将前向欧拉离散化嵌入卷积架构，通过CFL兼容的系数参数化确保稳定性和一阶收敛，模型权重直接对应PDE系数。

Result: 在多种PDEs（一维、二维和三维）的测试中，DeepFDM的归一化均方误差比Fourier Neural Operators、U-Nets和ResNets低1-2个数量级，训练周期少10-20倍，参数少5-50倍。

Conclusion: DeepFDM为数据驱动的PDE求解和参数识别提供了一种高效、稳定且透明的基准方法。

Abstract: We present DeepFDM, a differentiable finite-difference framework for learning
spatially varying coefficients in time-dependent partial differential equations
(PDEs). By embedding a classical forward-Euler discretization into a
convolutional architecture, DeepFDM enforces stability and first-order
convergence via CFL-compliant coefficient parameterizations. Model weights
correspond directly to PDE coefficients, yielding an interpretable
inverse-problem formulation. We evaluate DeepFDM on a benchmark suite of scalar
PDEs: advection, diffusion, advection-diffusion, reaction-diffusion and
inhomogeneous Burgers' equations-in one, two and three spatial dimensions. In
both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tests (quantified by the Hellinger
distance between coefficient priors), DeepFDM attains normalized mean-squared
errors one to two orders of magnitude smaller than Fourier Neural Operators,
U-Nets and ResNets; requires 10-20X fewer training epochs; and uses 5-50X fewer
parameters. Moreover, recovered coefficient fields accurately match
ground-truth parameters. These results establish DeepFDM as a robust,

### [298] [Real-Time Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement Using Pre-trained Visual Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21448)
*Teng,Ma,Sile Yin,Li-Chia Yang,Shuo Zhang*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种实时音视频语音增强系统RAVEN，通过结合音频和视觉信息，有效分离并增强目标说话人，同时抑制干扰说话人和背景噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在仅有音频的环境中，语音增强仍然具有挑战性，尤其是在存在干扰说话人的情况下。

Method: 研究了从音视频语音识别（AVSR）和主动说话人检测（ASD）中学习的视觉嵌入对AVSE的贡献，并开发了一个实时流式系统。

Result: 在低信噪比和多说话人环境中，结合AVSR和ASD嵌入效果最佳；在仅噪声场景中，AVSR嵌入表现最好。

Conclusion: RAVEN是首个开源的实时AVSE系统，展示了音视频结合在语音增强中的潜力。

Abstract: Speech enhancement in audio-only settings remains challenging, particularly
in the presence of interfering speakers. This paper presents a simple yet
effective real-time audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) system, RAVEN, which
isolates and enhances the on-screen target speaker while suppressing
interfering speakers and background noise. We investigate how visual embeddings
learned from audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) and active speaker
detection (ASD) contribute to AVSE across different SNR conditions and numbers
of interfering speakers. Our results show concatenating embeddings from AVSR
and ASD models provides the greatest improvement in low-SNR, multi-speaker
environments, while AVSR embeddings alone perform best in noise-only scenarios.
In addition, we develop a real-time streaming system that operates on a
computer CPU and we provide a video demonstration and code repository. To our
knowledge, this is the first open-source implementation of a real-time AVSE
system.

TL;DR: AI驱动的框架利用LLMs自动生成数据合同，显著减少人工工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据管道复杂度的增加，手动编写和维护数据合同变得容易出错且耗时。

Method: 采用参数高效微调方法（如LoRA和PEFT）调整LLMs，输入样本数据或模式描述，输出JSON Schema等格式的合同定义。

Result: 实验表明，微调后的LLMs生成有效合同的准确率高，减少人工工作量70%以上。

Conclusion: 生成式AI可扩展数据治理，弥合企业数据管理中意图与实现的差距。

Abstract: Data contracts formalize agreements between data producers and consumers
regarding schema, semantics, and quality expectations. As data pipelines grow
in complexity, manual authoring and maintenance of contracts becomes
error-prone and labor-intensive. We present an AI-driven framework for
automatic data contract generation using large language models (LLMs). Our
system leverages parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, including LoRA and
PEFT, to adapt LLMs to structured data domains. The models take sample data or
schema descriptions and output validated contract definitions in formats such
as JSON Schema and Avro. We integrate this framework into modern data platforms
(e.g., Databricks, Snowflake) to automate contract enforcement at scale.
Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the
fine-tuned LLMs achieve high accuracy in generating valid contracts and reduce
manual workload by over 70%. We also discuss key challenges such as
hallucination, version control, and the need for continuous learning. This work
demonstrates that generative AI can enable scalable, agile data governance by
bridging the gap between intent and implementation in enterprise data
management.

*Georges Sfeir,Gabriel Nova,Stephane Hess,Sander van Cranenburgh*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在多项Logit模型（MNL）规范和估计中的潜力，通过实验评估了六种主流LLM的表现，发现专有模型（如Claude 4 Sonnet和GPT）表现较好，而开源模型（如Llama和Gemma）表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在尚未充分研究的领域——选择建模中的潜力，尤其是作为辅助工具在模型规范和估计中的应用。

Method: 采用系统实验框架，评估13个版本的6种LLM在五种实验配置下的表现，包括建模目标、提示策略和信息可用性。

Result: 专有LLM能生成有效且行为合理的效用规范，尤其是结构化提示下；开源模型表现不佳；Claude 4 Sonnet表现最佳，GPT模型稳定；部分LLM在仅提供数据字典时表现更好。

Conclusion: LLMs在选择建模中具有潜力，但仍存在局限性，研究为实际工作流程中的集成提供了指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used to support various workflows
across different disciplines, yet their potential in choice modelling remains
relatively unexplored. This work examines the potential of LLMs as assistive
agents in the specification and, where technically feasible, estimation of
Multinomial Logit models. We implement a systematic experimental framework
involving thirteen versions of six leading LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek,
Gemini, Gemma, and Llama) evaluated under five experimental configurations.
These configurations vary along three dimensions: modelling goal (suggesting
vs. suggesting and estimating MNLs); prompting strategy (Zero-Shot vs.
Chain-of-Thoughts); and information availability (full dataset vs. data
dictionary only). Each LLM-suggested specification is implemented, estimated,
and evaluated based on goodness-of-fit metrics, behavioural plausibility, and
model complexity. Findings reveal that proprietary LLMs can generate valid and
behaviourally sound utility specifications, particularly when guided by
structured prompts. Open-weight models such as Llama and Gemma struggled to
produce meaningful specifications. Claude 4 Sonnet consistently produced the
best-fitting and most complex models, while GPT models suggested models with
robust and stable modelling outcomes. Some LLMs performed better when provided
with just data dictionary, suggesting that limiting raw data access may enhance
internal reasoning capabilities. Among all LLMs, GPT o3 was uniquely capable of
correctly estimating its own specifications by executing self-generated code.
Overall, the results demonstrate both the promise and current limitations of
LLMs as assistive agents in choice modelling, not only for model specification
but also for supporting modelling decision and estimation, and provide
practical guidance for integrating these tools into choice modellers'
workflows.

Abstract: Distinguishing pathogenic mutations from benign polymorphisms remains a
critical challenge in precision medicine. EnTao-GPM, developed by Fudan
University and BioMap, addresses this through three innovations: (1)
Cross-species targeted pre-training on disease-relevant mammalian genomes
(human, pig, mouse), leveraging evolutionary conservation to enhance
interpretation of pathogenic motifs, particularly in non-coding regions; (2)
Germline mutation specialization via fine-tuning on ClinVar and HGMD, improving
accuracy for both SNVs and non-SNVs; (3) Interpretable clinical framework
integrating DNA sequence embeddings with LLM-based statistical explanations to
provide actionable insights. Validated against ClinVar, EnTao-GPM demonstrates
superior accuracy in mutation classification. It revolutionizes genetic testing
by enabling faster, more accurate, and accessible interpretation for clinical
diagnostics (e.g., variant assessment, risk identification, personalized
treatment) and research, advancing personalized medicine.

Conclusion: 该框架具有通用性，可应用于其他系统，并可能通过实验视频推断未知参数。

Abstract: We introduce a unified machine-learning framework designed to conveniently
tackle the temporal evolution of alloy microstructures under the influence of
an elastic field. This approach allows for the simultaneous extraction of
elastic parameters from a short trajectory and for the prediction of further
microstructure evolution under their influence. This is demonstrated by
focusing on spinodal decomposition in the presence of a lattice mismatch eta,
and by carrying out an extensive comparison between the ground-truth evolution
supplied by phase field simulations and the predictions of suitable
convolutional recurrent neural network architectures. The two tasks may then be
performed subsequently into a cascade framework. Under a wide spectrum of
misfit conditions, the here-presented cascade model accurately predicts eta and
the full corresponding microstructure evolution, also when approaching critical
conditions for spinodal decomposition. Scalability to larger computational
domain sizes and mild extrapolation errors in time (for time sequences five
times longer than the sampled ones during training) are demonstrated. The
proposed framework is general and can be applied beyond the specific,
prototypical system considered here as an example. Intriguingly, experimental
videos could be used to infer unknown external parameters, prior to simulating
further temporal evolution.

Result: 该方法显著减少数据需求，加速设计过程。

Conclusion: 该方法有望在相关系统中广泛加速预测和设计，并为原子级设计提供新思路。

Abstract: Synthetic sequence-controlled polymers promise to transform polymer science
by combining the chemical versatility of synthetic polymers with the precise
sequence-mediated functionality of biological proteins. However, design of
these materials has proven extraordinarily challenging, because they lack the
massive datasets of closely related evolved molecules that accelerate design of
proteins. Here we report on a new Artifical Intelligence strategy to
dramatically reduce the amount of data necessary to accelerate these materials'
design. We focus on data connecting the repeat-unit-sequence of a
\emph{compatibilizer} molecule to its ability to reduce the interfacial tension
between distinct polymer domains. The optimal sequence of these molecules,
which are essential for applications such as mixed-waste polymer recycling,
depends strongly on variables such as concentration and chemical details of the
polymer. With current methods, this would demand an entirely distinct dataset
to enable design at each condition. Here we show that a deep neural network
trained on low-fidelity data for sequence/interfacial tension relations at one
set of conditions can be rapidly tuned to make higher-fidelity predictions at a
distinct set of conditions, requiring far less data that would ordinarily be
needed. This priming-and-tuning approach should allow a single low-fidelity
parent dataset to dramatically accelerate prediction and design in an entire
constellation of related systems. In the long run, it may also provide an
approach to bootstrapping quantitative atomistic design with AI insights from
fast, coarse simulations.

Conclusion: 现代方法在某些情况下更有效，但所有方法均需调参。

Abstract: This note investigates the problem of detecting outliers in longitudinal
data. It compares well-known methods used in official statistics with proposals
from the fields of data mining and machine learning that are based on the
distance between observations or binary partitioning trees. This is achieved by
applying the methods to panel survey data related to different types of
statistical units. Traditional methods are quite simple, enabling the direct
identification of potential outliers, but they require specific assumptions. In
contrast, recent methods provide only a score whose magnitude is directly
related to the likelihood of an outlier being present. All the methods require
the user to set a number of tuning parameters. However, the most recent methods
are more flexible and sometimes more effective than traditional methods. In
addition, these methods can be applied to multidimensional data.

Motivation: 探索如何通过高阶耦合（超越经典Kuramoto模型的成对相互作用）构建密集联想记忆网络，以提升记忆容量和鲁棒性。

Method: 引入广义Kuramoto模型，结合二次和四次谐波耦合，利用平均场理论及其动力学近似分析相图，并通过大规模仿真验证理论预测。

Result: 系统在四次谐波主导时表现出双稳态，记忆状态具有高鲁棒性，且记忆容量随系统规模超线性增长。

Conclusion: 该研究将Kuramoto同步与现代Hopfield记忆理论结合，为实验实现高容量模拟联想记忆提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Networks of phase oscillators can serve as dense associative memories if they
incorporate higher-order coupling beyond the classical Kuramoto model's
pairwise interactions. Here we introduce a generalized Kuramoto model with
combined second-harmonic (pairwise) and fourth-harmonic (quartic) coupling,
inspired by dense Hopfield memory theory. Using mean-field theory and its
dynamical approximation, we obtain a phase diagram for dense associative memory
model that exhibits a tricritical point at which the continuous onset of memory
retrieval is supplanted by a discontinuous, hysteretic transition. In the
quartic-dominated regime, the system supports bistable phase-locked states
corresponding to stored memory patterns, with a sizable energy barrier between
memory and incoherent states. We analytically determine this bistable region
and show that the escape time from a memory state (due to noise) grows
exponentially with network size, indicating robust storage. Extending the
theory to finite memory load, we show that higher-order couplings achieve
superlinear scaling of memory capacity with system size, far exceeding the
limit of pairwise-only oscillators. Large-scale simulations of the oscillator
network confirm our theoretical predictions, demonstrating rapid pattern
retrieval and robust storage of many phase patterns. These results bridge the
Kuramoto synchronization with modern Hopfield memories, pointing toward
experimental realization of high-capacity, analog associative memory in
oscillator systems.

Abstract: We show that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) may be fruitfully
exploited to learn stochastic dynamics, surrogating traditional models while
capturing thermal fluctuations. Specifically, we showcase the application to a
two-dimensional, many-particle system, focusing on surface-step fluctuations
and on the related time-dependent roughness. After the construction of a
dataset based on Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, a conditional GAN is trained
to propagate stochastically the state of the system in time, allowing the
generation of new sequences with a reduced computational cost. Modifications
with respect to standard GANs, which facilitate convergence and increase
accuracy, are discussed. The trained network is demonstrated to quantitatively
reproduce equilibrium and kinetic properties, including scaling laws, with
deviations of a few percent from the exact value. Extrapolation limits and
future perspectives are critically discussed.

Result: 适度增加量子不确定性可提升网络性能，物理噪声对模糊图像的分类影响显著。

Conclusion: 量子神经网络在近量子优势设备上具有潜力，未来可能扩展到更复杂的任务。

Abstract: We implement a quantum generalization of a neural network on trapped-ion and
IBM superconducting quantum computers to classify MNIST images, a common
benchmark in computer vision. The network feedforward involves qubit rotations
whose angles depend on the results of measurements in the previous layer. The
network is trained via simulation, but inference is performed experimentally on
quantum hardware. The classical-to-quantum correspondence is controlled by an
interpolation parameter, $a$, which is zero in the classical limit. Increasing
$a$ introduces quantum uncertainty into the measurements, which is shown to
improve network performance at moderate values of the interpolation parameter.
We then focus on particular images that fail to be classified by a classical
neural network but are detected correctly in the quantum network. For such
borderline cases, we observe strong deviations from the simulated behavior. We
attribute this to physical noise, which causes the output to fluctuate between
nearby minima of the classification energy landscape. Such strong sensitivity
to physical noise is absent for clear images. We further benchmark physical
noise by inserting additional single-qubit and two-qubit gate pairs into the
neural network circuits. Our work provides a springboard toward more complex
quantum neural networks on current devices: while the approach is rooted in
standard classical machine learning, scaling up such networks may prove
classically non-simulable and could offer a route to near-term quantum
advantage.

Result: FRQI在图像压缩中表现最优；量子内核在分类任务中与经典内核精度相当，但资源消耗更低。

Conclusion: 量子图像处理和内核在资源效率方面具有潜力，尤其是FRQI在压缩性能上表现突出。

Abstract: In the era of big data and artificial intelligence, the increasing volume of
data and the demand to solve more and more complex computational challenges are
two driving forces for improving the efficiency of data storage, processing and
analysis. Quantum image processing (QIP) is an interdisciplinary field between
quantum information science and image processing, which has the potential to
alleviate some of these challenges by leveraging the power of quantum
computing. In this work, we compare and examine the compression properties of
four different Quantum Image Representations (QImRs): namely, Tensor Network
Representation (TNR), Flexible Representation of Quantum Image (FRQI), Novel
Enhanced Quantum Representation NEQR, and Quantum Probability Image Encoding
(QPIE). Our simulations show that FRQI performs a higher compression of image
information than TNR, NEQR, and QPIE. Furthermore, we investigate the trade-off
between accuracy and memory in binary classification problems, evaluating the
performance of quantum kernels based on QImRs compared to the classical linear
kernel. Our results indicate that quantum kernels provide comparable
classification average accuracy but require exponentially fewer resources for
image storage.

Abstract: We develop a quantum version of the em algorithm for training quantum

the well-known expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, offering a structured
alternative to gradient-based methods with potential advantages in stability
and convergence. We implement the algorithm on a semi-quantum restricted
Boltzmann machine, where quantum effects are confined to the hidden layer. This
structure enables analytical update rules while preserving quantum
expressivity. Numerical experiments on benchmark datasets show that the
proposed method achieves stable learning and outperforms gradient-based
training in several cases. These results demonstrate the potential of
information-geometric optimization for quantum machine learning, particularly
in settings where standard methods struggle due to non-commutativity or

Conclusion: QKM为量子加速模拟非线性现象提供了实用框架，结合深度学习和量子算法的优势。

Abstract: Quantum computation offers potential exponential speedups for simulating
certain physical systems, but its application to nonlinear dynamics is
inherently constrained by the requirement of unitary evolution. We propose the
quantum Koopman method (QKM), a data-driven framework that bridges this gap
through transforming nonlinear dynamics into linear unitary evolution in
higher-dimensional observable spaces. Leveraging the Koopman operator theory to
achieve a global linearization, our approach maps system states into a
hierarchy of Hilbert spaces using a deep autoencoder. Within the linearized
embedding spaces, the state representation is decomposed into modulus and phase
components, and the evolution is governed by a set of unitary Koopman operators
that act exclusively on the phase. These operators are constructed from
diagonal Hamiltonians with coefficients learned from data, a structure designed
for efficient implementation on quantum hardware. This architecture enables
direct multi-step prediction, and the operator's computational complexity
scales logarithmically with the observable space dimension. The QKM is
validated across diverse nonlinear systems. Its predictions maintain relative
errors below 6% for reaction-diffusion systems and shear flows, and capture key
statistics in 2D turbulence. This work establishes a practical pathway for
quantum-accelerated simulation of nonlinear phenomena, exploring a framework
built on the synergy between deep learning for global linearization and quantum
algorithms for unitary dynamics evolution.

Motivation: 尽管社交媒体平台采取了主动审核措施，但仍被批评为审查且未能解决不文明行为的根源。研究旨在通过情绪监控工具改善这一状况。

Method: 研究设计了两种情绪监控仪表板，并通过211名参与者的实验评估其对用户评论行为和情绪体验的影响。

Result: 干预措施有效提升了用户的情绪意识并减少了仇恨言论，但也可能增加敏感话题讨论中的负面情绪表达。

Conclusion: 研究为社交媒体平台整合主动情绪调节工具以促进健康数字互动提供了基础。

Abstract: Social media platforms increasingly employ proactive moderation techniques,
such as detecting and curbing toxic and uncivil comments, to prevent the spread
of harmful content. Despite these efforts, such approaches are often criticized
for creating a climate of censorship and failing to address the underlying
causes of uncivil behavior. Our work makes both theoretical and practical
contributions by proposing and evaluating two types of emotion monitoring
dashboards to users' emotional awareness and mitigate hate speech. In a study
involving 211 participants, we evaluate the effects of the two mechanisms on
user commenting behavior and emotional experiences. The results reveal that
these interventions effectively increase users' awareness of their emotional
states and reduce hate speech. However, our findings also indicate potential
unintended effects, including increased expression of negative emotions (Angry,
Fear, and Sad) when discussing sensitive issues. These insights provide a basis
for further research on integrating proactive emotion regulation tools into
social media platforms to foster healthier digital interactions.

Abstract: We present VizGenie, a self-improving, agentic framework that advances
scientific visualization through large language model (LLM) by orchestrating of
a collection of domain-specific and dynamically generated modules. Users
initially access core functionalities--such as threshold-based filtering, slice
extraction, and statistical analysis--through pre-existing tools. For tasks
beyond this baseline, VizGenie autonomously employs LLMs to generate new
visualization scripts (e.g., VTK Python code), expanding its capabilities
on-demand. Each generated script undergoes automated backend validation and is
seamlessly integrated upon successful testing, continuously enhancing the
system's adaptability and robustness. A distinctive feature of VizGenie is its
intuitive natural language interface, allowing users to issue high-level
feature-based queries (e.g., ``visualize the skull"). The system leverages
image-based analysis and visual question answering (VQA) via fine-tuned vision
models to interpret these queries precisely, bridging domain expertise and
technical implementation. Additionally, users can interactively query generated
visualizations through VQA, facilitating deeper exploration. Reliability and
reproducibility are further strengthened by Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG), providing context-driven responses while maintaining comprehensive
provenance records. Evaluations on complex volumetric datasets demonstrate
significant reductions in cognitive overhead for iterative visualization tasks.
By integrating curated domain-specific tools with LLM-driven flexibility,
VizGenie not only accelerates insight generation but also establishes a
sustainable, continuously evolving visualization practice. The resulting
platform dynamically learns from user interactions, consistently enhancing
support for feature-centric exploration and reproducible research in scientific
visualization.

*Qinglong Yang,Haoming Li,Haotian Zhao,Xiaokai Yan,Jingtao Ding,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了FingerTip基准，用于解决移动GUI代理在主动意图预测和个性化任务执行方面的不足，通过分析用户环境和历史意图提升交互效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前移动GUI代理仅能执行显式指令，缺乏主动意图预测能力，且未充分利用用户上下文信息，忽视了用户偏好的差异。

Method: 引入FingerTip基准，包含两个新任务：通过环境观察和用户历史意图进行主动任务建议，以及根据用户偏好执行个性化任务。收集了多步Android设备交互的真实用户数据。

Result: 实验表明，所提出的任务具有挑战性，但基于收集数据微调的模型能有效利用用户信息并取得良好效果。

Conclusion: FingerTip基准展示了构建更用户导向的移动GUI代理的潜力，相关代码已开源。

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents are becoming critical tools for enhancing human-device
interaction efficiency, with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) emerging
as dominant paradigms in this domain. Current agents, however, are limited to
following explicit human instructions, resulting in insufficient capability for
proactive intent anticipation. Additionally, these agents fail to leverage the
contextual information associated with users during task execution, thereby
neglecting potentially vast differences in user preferences. To address these
challenges, we introduce the FingerTip benchmark. It contains two new tracks:
proactive task suggestions by analyzing environment observation and users'
previous intents, and personalized task execution by catering to users' action
preferences. We collected unique human demonstrations of multi-step Android
device interactions across a variety of everyday apps. These demonstrations are
not isolated but are continuously acquired from the users' long-term usage in
their real lives, and encompass essential user-related contextual information.
Our experiments reveal challenges of the tasks we propose. The model fine-tuned
with the data we collected effectively utilized user information and achieved
good results, highlighting the potential of our approach in building more
user-oriented mobile GUI agents. Our code is open-source at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FingerTip-57B8 for reproducibility.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究探讨教育者如何设计和使用生成式AI工具（如GPT）在定性研究方法课程中，发现其能提升学生反思能力和分析思维，但也存在认知负担和数据沉浸不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补学生被动使用AI的空白，探索AI在定性方法教育中的应用潜力，并强调教育者在AI工具设计中的主导作用。

Method: 基于TPACK框架和行动研究方法，设计四种定制GPT工具，用于支持研究问题制定、访谈练习等任务，并通过学生反馈、AI日志和作业进行主题分析。

Result: AI工具提升了学生的反思能力和访谈技巧，但也带来认知负担和数据沉浸不足的缺点。

Conclusion: AI可作为主动学习的支架，定制GPT能成为研究实践的认知伙伴，教育者主导的设计对AI教育整合至关重要。

Abstract: As generative AI (Gen-AI) tools become more prevalent in education, there is
a growing need to understand how educators, not just students, can actively
shape their design and use. This study investigates how two instructors
integrated four custom GPT tools into a Masters-level Qualitative Research
Methods course for Urban Planning Policy students. Addressing two key gaps: the
dominant framing of students as passive AI users, and the limited use of AI in
qualitative methods education. The study explores how Gen-AI can support
disciplinary learning when aligned with pedagogical intent. Drawing on the
Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework and action
research methodology, the instructors designed GPTs to scaffold tasks such as
research question formulation, interview practice, fieldnote analysis, and
design thinking. Thematic analysis of student reflections, AI chat logs, and
final assignments revealed that the tools enhanced student reflexivity,
improved interview techniques, and supported structured analytic thinking.
However, students also expressed concerns about cognitive overload, reduced
immersion in data, and the formulaic nature of AI responses. The study offers
three key insights: AI can be a powerful scaffold for active learning when
paired with human facilitation; custom GPTs can serve as cognitive partners in
iterative research practice; and educator-led design is critical to
pedagogically meaningful AI integration. This research contributes to emerging
scholarship on AI in higher education by demonstrating how empowering educators
to design custom tools can promote more reflective, responsible, and
collaborative learning with AI.

TL;DR: 论文提出神经包容性AI，反对以模仿人类为标准的AI发展，揭示当前AI研究中90%的人类化AI代理排斥自闭症视角，并提出AUTALIC基准以改善数据代表性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI数据偏见将自闭症视为缺陷而非多样性，导致全球7500万自闭症人群被边缘化。研究旨在推动神经包容性AI发展。

Method: 通过实证实验，使用标注者和LLMs分析反自闭症偏见，开发AUTALIC基准用于模型评估或微调。

Result: 研究发现90%的人类化AI代理排斥自闭症视角，且AI开发者常忽视伦理考量。AUTALIC基准能有效捕捉反自闭症仇恨言论的细微差别。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁未来AI研究应更注重神经包容性，AUTALIC基准为相关研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Biased data representation in AI marginalizes up to 75 million autistic
people worldwide through medical applications viewing autism as a deficit of
neurotypical social skills rather than an aspect of human diversity, and this
perspective is grounded in research questioning the humanity of autistic
people. Turing defined artificial intelligence as the ability to mimic human
communication, and as AI development increasingly focuses on human-like agents,
this benchmark remains popular. In contrast, we define Neuro-Inclusive AI as
datasets and systems that move away from mimicking humanness as a benchmark for
machine intelligence. Then, we explore the origins, prevalence, and impact of
anti-autistic biases in current research. Our work finds that 90% of human-like
AI agents exclude autistic perspectives, and AI creators continue to believe
ethical considerations are beyond the scope of their work. To improve the
autistic representation in data, we conduct empirical experiments with
annotators and LLMs, finding that binary labeling schemes sufficiently capture
the nuances of labeling anti-autistic hate speech. Our benchmark, AUTALIC, can
be used to evaluate or fine-tune models, and was developed to serve as a
foundation for more neuro-inclusive future work.

Motivation: 研究解释行为中的情感作用，将其视为一种社会互动，探讨解释者如何考虑听众的情感反应。

Method: 开发了一个计算框架，模拟解释者如何权衡解释对听众情感的影响，并以医生向患者解释疾病的场景进行测试。

Result: 模型能较好地预测人类直觉，优于不考虑情感的简化模型，表明人们在解释时确实会考虑情感因素。

Conclusion: 情感在解释行为中扮演重要角色，计算框架为理解解释的社会互动提供了新视角。

Abstract: Why do we give the explanations we do? Recent work has suggested that we
should think of explanation as a kind of cooperative social interaction,
between a why-question-asker and an explainer. Here, we apply this perspective
to consider the role that emotion plays in this social interaction. We develop
a computational framework for modeling explainers who consider the emotional
impact an explanation might have on a listener. We test our framework by using
it to model human intuitions about how a doctor might explain to a patient why
they have a disease, taking into account the patient's propensity for regret.
Our model predicts human intuitions well, better than emotion-agnostic
ablations, suggesting that people do indeed reason about emotion when giving
explanations.

Result: 交互式模拟显著提升AI素养，支持知识迁移和信心提升，但参与度不直接预测学习效果。

Conclusion: 交互式、探究驱动的方法能更好帮助人们批判性应对日常AI问题。

Abstract: As AI systems shape individual and societal decisions, fostering critical AI
literacy is essential. Traditional approaches, such as blog articles, static
lessons, and social media discussions, often fail to support deep conceptual
understanding and critical engagement. This study examines whether interactive
simulations can help learners think like a scientist by engaging them in
hypothesis testing, experimentation, and direct observation of AI behavior. In
a controlled study with 605 participants, we assess how interactive AI
tutorials impact learning of key concepts such as fairness, dataset
representativeness, and bias in language models. Results show that interactive
simulations effectively enhance AI literacy across topics, supporting greater
knowledge transfer and self-reported confidence, though engagement alone does
not predict learning. This work contributes to the growing field of AI literacy
education, highlighting how interactive, inquiry-driven methodologies can
better equip individuals to critically engage with AI in their daily lives.

Motivation: 现有可穿戴AI系统依赖用户主动触发或预定义任务知识，忽视了用户的实时心理状态。

Method: 基于认知理论建模工作记忆，利用编码机制（如替换和干扰）表示信息，并通过时间预测器平衡辅助价值与中断成本。

Result: 在12名参与者的实验中，ProMemAssist比LLM基线系统提供更精准的辅助，用户参与度更高。

Conclusion: 工作记忆建模能实现更细腻、上下文敏感的辅助，为设计更关注用户的主动代理提供启示。

Abstract: Wearable AI systems aim to provide timely assistance in daily life, but
existing approaches often rely on user initiation or predefined task knowledge,
neglecting users' current mental states. We introduce ProMemAssist, a smart
glasses system that models a user's working memory (WM) in real-time using
multi-modal sensor signals. Grounded in cognitive theories of WM, our system
represents perceived information as memory items and episodes with encoding
mechanisms, such as displacement and interference. This WM model informs a
timing predictor that balances the value of assistance with the cost of
interruption. In a user study with 12 participants completing cognitively
demanding tasks, ProMemAssist delivered more selective assistance and received
higher engagement compared to an LLM baseline system. Qualitative feedback
highlights the benefits of WM modeling for nuanced, context-sensitive support,
offering design implications for more attentive and user-aware proactive
agents.

Conclusion: AI素养而非接触经验塑造学生体验，设计者应整合适应性指导和用户中心功能以支持多样化的素养水平，创造包容、激励和有效的AI学习环境。

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools become increasingly embedded in higher
education, understanding how students interact with these systems is essential
to supporting effective learning. This study examines how students' AI literacy
and prior exposure to AI technologies shape their perceptions of Socratic Mind,
an interactive AI-powered formative assessment tool. Drawing on
Self-Determination Theory and user experience research, we analyze
relationships among AI literacy, perceived usability, satisfaction, engagement,
and perceived learning effectiveness. Data from 309 undergraduates in Computer
Science and Business courses were collected through validated surveys. Partial
least squares structural equation modeling showed that AI literacy - especially
self-efficacy, conceptual understanding, and application skills - significantly
predicts usability, satisfaction, and engagement. Usability and satisfaction,
in turn, strongly predict perceived learning effectiveness, while prior AI
exposure showed no significant effect. These findings highlight that AI
literacy, rather than exposure alone, shapes student experiences. Designers
should integrate adaptive guidance and user-centered features to support
diverse literacy levels, fostering inclusive, motivating, and effective
AI-based learning environments.

Result: 实验显示MapAgent在真实场景中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MapAgent通过记忆增强和上下文感知任务规划，显著提升了LLM代理的性能。

Abstract: The recent advancement of autonomous agents powered by Large Language Models
(LLMs) has demonstrated significant potential for automating tasks on mobile
devices through graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Despite initial progress,
these agents still face challenges when handling complex real-world tasks.
These challenges arise from a lack of knowledge about real-life mobile
applications in LLM-based agents, which may lead to ineffective task planning
and even cause hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
LLM-based agent framework called MapAgent that leverages memory constructed
from historical trajectories to augment current task planning. Specifically, we
first propose a trajectory-based memory mechanism that transforms task
execution trajectories into a reusable and structured page-memory database.
Each page within a trajectory is extracted as a compact yet comprehensive
snapshot, capturing both its UI layout and functional context. Secondly, we
introduce a coarse-to-fine task planning approach that retrieves relevant pages
from the memory database based on similarity and injects them into the LLM
planner to compensate for potential deficiencies in understanding real-world
app scenarios, thereby achieving more informed and context-aware task planning.
Finally, planned tasks are transformed into executable actions through a task
executor supported by a dual-LLM architecture, ensuring effective tracking of
task progress. Experimental results in real-world scenarios demonstrate that
MapAgent achieves superior performance to existing methods. The code will be
open-sourced to support further research.

Conclusion: 微分神经元可作为积分神经元的替代方案，为高能耗AI应用提供可持续的解决方案。

Abstract: Reservoir Computing is a machine learning approach that uses the rich
repertoire of complex system dynamics for function approximation. Current
approaches to reservoir computing use a network of coupled integrating neurons
that require a steady current to maintain activity. Here, we introduce a small
world graph of differentiating neurons that are active only when there are
changes in input as an alternative to integrating neurons as a reservoir
computing substrate. We find the coupling strength and network topology that
enable these small world networks to function as an effective reservoir. We
demonstrate the efficacy of these networks in the MNIST digit recognition task,
achieving comparable performance of 90.65% to existing reservoir computing
approaches. The findings suggest that differentiating neurons can be a
potential alternative to integrating neurons and can provide a sustainable
future alternative for power-hungry AI applications.

Motivation: 当前循环神经网络依赖隐式隐藏状态记忆，限制了其解释性和长程依赖建模能力。受生物神经系统中显式记忆痕迹的启发，作者设计了ENN。

Method: ENN通过动态Hebbian痕迹显式建模记忆形成和回忆，结合稀疏注意力驱动检索机制。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和WikiText-103任务上，ENN性能与经典RNN、GRU和LSTM相当，同时显著提升了可解释性。

Conclusion: ENN展示了神经科学启发的机制在开发更可解释和鲁棒的深度学习模型中的潜力。

Abstract: Despite success across diverse tasks, current artificial recurrent network
architectures rely primarily on implicit hidden-state memories, limiting their
interpretability and ability to model long-range dependencies. In contrast,
biological neural systems employ explicit, associative memory traces (i.e.,
engrams) strengthened through Hebbian synaptic plasticity and activated
sparsely during recall. Motivated by these neurobiological insights, we
introduce the Engram Neural Network (ENN), a novel recurrent architecture
incorporating an explicit, differentiable memory matrix with Hebbian plasticity
and sparse, attention-driven retrieval mechanisms. The ENN explicitly models
memory formation and recall through dynamic Hebbian traces, improving
transparency and interpretability compared to conventional RNN variants. We
evaluate the ENN architecture on three canonical benchmarks: MNIST digit
classification, CIFAR-10 image sequence modeling, and WikiText-103 language
modeling. Our empirical results demonstrate that the ENN achieves accuracy and
generalization performance broadly comparable to classical RNN, GRU, and LSTM
architectures, with all models converging to similar accuracy and perplexity on
the large-scale WikiText-103 task. At the same time, the ENN offers significant
enhancements in interpretability through observable memory dynamics. Hebbian
trace visualizations further reveal biologically plausible, structured memory
formation processes, validating the potential of neuroscience-inspired
mechanisms to inform the development of more interpretable and robust deep
learning models.

Result: 理论结果通过数值实验验证，明确了温度参数对策略随机性的影响。

Conclusion: 本文为互信息最优控制中温度参数与策略随机性的关系提供了理论支持，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In recent years, mutual information optimal control has been proposed as an
extension of maximum entropy optimal control. Both approaches introduce
regularization terms to render the policy stochastic, and it is important to
theoretically clarify the relationship between the temperature parameter (i.e.,
the coefficient of the regularization term) and the stochasticity of the
policy. Unlike in maximum entropy optimal control, this relationship remains
unexplored in mutual information optimal control. In this paper, we investigate
this relationship for a mutual information optimal control problem (MIOCP) of
discrete-time linear systems. After extending the result of a previous study of
the MIOCP, we establish the existence of an optimal policy of the MIOCP, and
then derive the respective conditions on the temperature parameter under which
the optimal policy becomes stochastic and deterministic. Furthermore, we also
derive the respective conditions on the temperature parameter under which the
policy obtained by an alternating optimization algorithm becomes stochastic and
deterministic. The validity of the theoretical results is demonstrated through
numerical experiments.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of the gain spectrum in Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers
(EDFAs) is essential for optimizing optical network performance, particularly
as networks evolve toward multi-vendor solutions. In this work, we propose a
generalized few-shot transfer learning architecture based on a Semi-Supervised
Self-Normalizing Neural Network (SS-NN) that leverages internal EDFA features -
such as VOA input or output power and attenuation, to improve gain spectrum
prediction. Our SS-NN model employs a two-phase training strategy comprising
unsupervised pre-training with noise-augmented measurements and supervised
fine-tuning with a custom weighted MSE loss. Furthermore, we extend the
framework with transfer learning (TL) techniques that enable both homogeneous
(same-feature space) and heterogeneous (different-feature sets) model
adaptation across booster, preamplifier, and ILA EDFAs. To address feature
mismatches in heterogeneous TL, we incorporate a covariance matching loss to
align second-order feature statistics between source and target domains.
Extensive experiments conducted across 26 EDFAs in the COSMOS and Open Ireland
testbeds demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces the
number of measurements requirements on the system while achieving lower mean
absolute errors and improved error distributions compared to benchmark methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G网络中cell DTX/DRX虽能节能，但会增加数据包延迟，需找到最优配置以平衡节能与服务质量。

Method: 采用深度强化学习（DRL）框架，设计基于深度Q网络（DQN）和上下文赌博机（CB）模型的AI代理，优化配置。

Result: 仿真显示，AI代理能实现最高45%的节能，且服务质量下降不超过1%。

Conclusion: 通过DRL优化cell DTX/DRX配置，可在不同网络和流量条件下实现高效节能与服务质量保障。

Abstract: 3GPP Release 18 cell discontinuous transmission and reception (cell DTX/DRX)
is an important new network energy saving feature for 5G. As a time-domain
technique, it periodically aggregates the user data transmissions in a given
duration of time when the traffic load is not heavy, so that the remaining time
can be kept silent and advanced sleep modes (ASM) can be enabled to shut down
more radio components and save more energy for the cell. However, inevitably
the packet delay is increased, as during the silent period no transmission is
allowed. In this paper we study how to configure cell DTX/DRX to optimally
balance energy saving and packet delay, so that for delay-sensitive traffic
maximum energy saving can be achieved while the degradation of quality of
service (QoS) is minimized. As the optimal configuration can be different for
different network and traffic conditions, the problem is complex and we resort
to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to train an AI agent to solve
it. Through careful design of 1) the learning algorithm, which implements a
deep Q-network (DQN) on a contextual bandit (CB) model, and 2) the reward
function, which utilizes a smooth approximation of a theoretically optimal but
discontinuous reward function, we are able to train an AI agent that always
tries to select the best possible Cell DTX/DRX configuration under any network
and traffic conditions. Simulation results show that compared to the case when
cell DTX/DRX is not used, our agent can achieve up to ~45% energy saving
depending on the traffic load scenario, while always maintaining no more than
~1% QoS degradation.

*Rene Winchenbach,Nils Thuerey*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: diffSPH是一个基于PyTorch的GPU加速可微分SPH框架，支持CFD中的优化和机器学习应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为计算流体动力学（CFD）中的优化和机器学习应用提供一个可微分的SPH框架，以支持神经网络的训练和混合模型的开发。

Method: 开发了一个可微分的SPH核心，支持可压缩、弱可压缩和不可压缩流体物理，并提供了多种应用方案。

Result: 展示了框架的独特能力，包括粒子位移优化、初始条件和物理参数优化、形状优化等。

Conclusion: diffSPH为CFD社区提供了一个可读性强、易用且可扩展的平台，支持新型神经网络和伴随优化应用的开发。

Abstract: We present diffSPH, a novel open-source differentiable Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamics (SPH) framework developed entirely in PyTorch with GPU
acceleration. diffSPH is designed centrally around differentiation to
facilitate optimization and machine learning (ML) applications in Computational
Fluid Dynamics~(CFD), including training neural networks and the development of
hybrid models. Its differentiable SPH core, and schemes for compressible (with
shock capturing and multi-phase flows), weakly compressible (with boundary
handling and free-surface flows), and incompressible physics, enable a broad
range of application areas. We demonstrate the framework's unique capabilities
through several applications, including addressing particle shifting via a
novel, target-oriented approach by minimizing physical and regularization loss
terms, a task often intractable in traditional solvers. Further examples
include optimizing initial conditions and physical parameters to match target
trajectories, shape optimization, implementing a solver-in-the-loop setup to
emulate higher-order integration, and demonstrating gradient propagation
through hundreds of full simulation steps. Prioritizing readability, usability,
and extensibility, this work offers a foundational platform for the CFD
community to develop and deploy novel neural networks and adjoint optimization
applications.

*Tiviatis Sim,Kaiwen Yang,Shen Xin,Kenji Kawaguchi*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SUnSET的新框架，用于通过利益相关者和事件关系改进时间线摘要任务，利用大型语言模型构建SET三元组，并引入利益相关者排名方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有新闻摘要方法仅基于文本内容和相似日期的文章，缺乏对利益相关者的分析，导致效果不佳。

Method: 提出SUnSET框架，利用大型语言模型构建SET（利益相关者、事件、时间）三元组，并引入利益相关者排名方法构建相关性指标。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法优于所有现有基线，成为新的最先进技术。

Conclusion: 利益相关者信息在新闻文章中的重要性被证实，SUnSET框架为时间线摘要任务提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: As news reporting becomes increasingly global and decentralized online,
tracking related events across multiple sources presents significant
challenges. Existing news summarization methods typically utilizes Large
Language Models and Graphical methods on article-based summaries. However, this
is not effective since it only considers the textual content of similarly dated
articles to understand the gist of the event. To counteract the lack of
analysis on the parties involved, it is essential to come up with a novel
framework to gauge the importance of stakeholders and the connection of related
events through the relevant entities involved. Therefore, we present SUnSET:
Synergistic Understanding of Stakeholder, Events and Time for the task of
Timeline Summarization (TLS). We leverage powerful Large Language Models (LLMs)
to build SET triplets and introduced the use of stakeholder-based ranking to
construct a $Relevancy$ metric, which can be extended into general situations.
Our experimental results outperform all prior baselines and emerged as the new
State-of-the-Art, highlighting the impact of stakeholder information within
news article.

*Guanxiong Chen,Shashwat Suri,Yuhao Wu,Etienne Voulga,David I. W. Levin,Dinesh Pai*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Mass-Spring Net的框架，通过学习运动观测数据，构建高效的替代模型，模拟复杂布料材料，避免了传统有限元方法的计算负担和膜锁定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实布料材料因多种加工过程（如缝合、染色、印刷等）具有复杂性和空间变化性，传统有限元方法计算量大且易出现膜锁定问题。

Method: 将布料离散化为质量-弹簧网络，通过新型力-冲量损失函数从运动数据中学习未知材料参数。

Result: 能够准确建模空间变化的材料特性，避免了膜锁定问题，训练速度更快，重建精度更高，泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: Mass-Spring Net是一种高效且准确的布料模拟方法，优于基于图和神经ODE的架构。

Abstract: Materials used in real clothing exhibit remarkable complexity and spatial
variation due to common processes such as stitching, hemming, dyeing, printing,
padding, and bonding. Simulating these materials, for instance using finite
element methods, is often computationally demanding and slow. Worse, such
methods can suffer from numerical artifacts called ``membrane locking'' that
makes cloth appear artificially stiff. Here we propose a general framework,
called Mass-Spring Net, for learning a simple yet efficient surrogate model
that captures the effects of these complex materials using only motion
observations. The cloth is discretized into a mass-spring network with unknown
material parameters that are learned directly from the motion data, using a
novel force-and-impulse loss function. Our approach demonstrates the ability to
accurately model spatially varying material properties from a variety of data
sources, and immunity to membrane locking which plagues FEM-based simulations.
Compared to graph-based networks and neural ODE-based architectures, our method
achieves significantly faster training times, higher reconstruction accuracy,
and improved generalization to novel dynamic scenarios.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 提出Sync-TVA框架，通过动态增强和跨模态融合提升多模态情感识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多模态情感识别中存在跨模态交互不足和模态贡献不平衡的问题。

Method: 采用端到端的图注意力框架，结合模态动态增强模块和异构跨模态图建模，并通过跨注意力融合机制对齐多模态信息。

Result: 在MELD和IEMOCAP数据集上，准确率和加权F1分数均优于现有最优模型。

Conclusion: Sync-TVA框架有效解决了跨模态交互和模态贡献不平衡问题，提升了情感识别的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) is crucial for enabling emotionally
intelligent systems that perceive and respond to human emotions. However,
existing methods suffer from limited cross-modal interaction and imbalanced
contributions across modalities. To address these issues, we propose Sync-TVA,
an end-to-end graph-attention framework featuring modality-specific dynamic
enhancement and structured cross-modal fusion. Our design incorporates a
dynamic enhancement module for each modality and constructs heterogeneous
cross-modal graphs to model semantic relations across text, audio, and visual
features. A cross-attention fusion mechanism further aligns multimodal cues for
robust emotion inference. Experiments on MELD and IEMOCAP demonstrate
consistent improvements over state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and
weighted F1 score, especially under class-imbalanced conditions.

*Katerina Marie Simkova,Adrien Doerig,Clayton Hickey,Ian Charest*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: 研究发现，人类视觉和语言相似性判断基于共享的、模态无关的表征结构，与视觉系统编码经验的方式一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉和语言是否共享一种嵌入式的表征空间，以及这种空间如何体现在人类行为中。

Method: 63名参与者对100张自然场景图像和100个对应句子进行行为相似性判断，并与fMRI脑响应和计算模型结果对比。

Result: 视觉和语言相似性判断在行为层面和脑响应层面均表现出收敛，且基于LLM嵌入的计算模型优于其他模型。

Conclusion: 人类视觉和语言系统共享一种模态无关的表征结构，反映了外部世界的稳定关系属性。

Abstract: Humans can effortlessly describe what they see, yet establishing a shared
representational format between vision and language remains a significant
challenge. Emerging evidence suggests that human brain representations in both
vision and language are well predicted by semantic feature spaces obtained from
large language models (LLMs). This raises the possibility that sensory systems
converge in their inherent ability to transform their inputs onto shared,
embedding-like representational space. However, it remains unclear how such a
space manifests in human behaviour. To investigate this, sixty-three
participants performed behavioural similarity judgements separately on 100
natural scene images and 100 corresponding sentence captions from the Natural
Scenes Dataset. We found that visual and linguistic similarity judgements not
only converge at the behavioural level but also predict a remarkably similar
network of fMRI brain responses evoked by viewing the natural scene images.
Furthermore, computational models trained to map images onto LLM-embeddings
outperformed both category-trained and AlexNet controls in explaining the
behavioural similarity structure. These findings demonstrate that human visual
and linguistic similarity judgements are grounded in a shared,
modality-agnostic representational structure that mirrors how the visual system
encodes experience. The convergence between sensory and artificial systems
suggests a common capacity of how conceptual representations are formed-not as
arbitrary products of first order, modality-specific input, but as structured
representations that reflect the stable, relational properties of the external
world.

*Cameron Churchwell,Minje Kim,Paris Smaragdis*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“combolutional layer”的新方法，用于音频任务中的谐波特征提取，替代传统卷积层，具有低参数量、高效CPU推理等优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在音频任务中，短片段可能包含数百万样本，选择合适的归纳偏置对机器学习模型设计至关重要。

Method: 提出combolutional layer，结合学习延迟的IIR梳状滤波器和融合包络检测器，在时域中提取谐波特征。

Result: 在钢琴转录、说话人分类和音调检测等任务中表现优异，且参数量低、计算高效。

Conclusion: combolutional layer是音频任务中卷积层的有效替代，尤其在需要精确谐波分析的场景中。

Abstract: Selecting appropriate inductive biases is an essential step in the design of
machine learning models, especially when working with audio, where even short
clips may contain millions of samples. To this end, we propose the
combolutional layer: a learned-delay IIR comb filter and fused envelope
detector, which extracts harmonic features in the time domain. We demonstrate
the efficacy of the combolutional layer on three information retrieval tasks,
evaluate its computational cost relative to other audio frontends, and provide
efficient implementations for training. We find that the combolutional layer is
an effective replacement for convolutional layers in audio tasks where precise
harmonic analysis is important, e.g., piano transcription, speaker
classification, and key detection. Additionally, the combolutional layer has
several other key benefits over existing frontends, namely: low parameter
count, efficient CPU inference, strictly real-valued computations, and improved
interpretability.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Whilter模型是一种多任务解决方案，用于识别大规模语音数据集中的不良样本（如多说话者、非目标语言和音乐），其基于Whisper编码器和注意力分类器，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语音数据集中存在不良特征（如多说话者、非目标语言和音乐），可能影响模型学习，需要一种高效的多任务解决方案。

Method: Whilter结合Whisper编码器和注意力分类器，同时解决五个分类问题，并发布了一个标注数据集。

Result: Whilter在五个子任务中的三个上F1分数超过85%，错误率6.5%-7.8%，优于BEATs分类器，且处理时间更短。

Conclusion: Whilter是一种高效的多任务模型，适用于识别语音数据集中的不良样本，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large-scale in-the-wild speech datasets have become more prevalent in recent
years due to increased interest in models that can learn useful features from
unlabelled data for tasks such as speech recognition or synthesis. These
datasets often contain undesirable features, such as multiple speakers,
non-target languages, and music, which may impact model learning. The Whilter
model is proposed as a multitask solution to identify these undesirable
samples. Whilter uses a Whisper encoder with an attention-based classifier to
solve five diverse classification problems at once. In addition, an annotated
dataset is published for a subset of two popular in-the-wild corpora. Whilter
achieves F1 scores above 85% and equal error rates of 6.5% to 7.8% for three of
five subtasks, outperforming a state-of-the-art BEATs classifier on
speech-specific classes, with a notable decrease in processing time compared to
a combination of single-task alternatives.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: DeepGo是一种预测性定向灰盒模糊测试工具，结合历史和预测信息，通过最优路径引导模糊测试到达目标位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有定向灰盒模糊测试（DGF）技术依赖启发式算法优化适应度指标，缺乏对未执行路径的前瞻性，导致难以处理复杂约束路径，效率低下。

Method: 提出路径转换模型，使用深度神经网络构建虚拟集成环境（VEE）预测路径转换及其奖励，并通过强化学习模型（RLF）生成最优路径转换序列。

Result: DeepGo能高效引导模糊测试通过最优路径到达目标位置。

Conclusion: DeepGo通过结合历史和预测信息，显著提升了定向灰盒模糊测试的效率和精确性。

Abstract: The state-of-the-art DGF techniques redefine and optimize the fitness metric
to reach the target sites precisely and quickly. However, optimizations for
fitness metrics are mainly based on heuristic algorithms, which usually rely on
historical execution information and lack foresight on paths that have not been
exercised yet. Thus, those hard-to-execute paths with complex constraints would
hinder DGF from reaching the targets, making DGF less efficient. In this paper,
we propose DeepGo, a predictive directed grey-box fuzzer that can combine
historical and predicted information to steer DGF to reach the target site via
an optimal path. We first propose the path transition model, which models DGF
as a process of reaching the target site through specific path transition
sequences. The new seed generated by mutation would cause the path transition,
and the path corresponding to the high-reward path transition sequence
indicates a high likelihood of reaching the target site through it. Then, to
predict the path transitions and the corresponding rewards, we use deep neural
networks to construct a Virtual Ensemble Environment (VEE), which gradually
imitates the path transition model and predicts the rewards of path transitions
that have not been taken yet. To determine the optimal path, we develop a
Reinforcement Learning for Fuzzing (RLF) model to generate the transition
sequences with the highest sequence rewards. The RLF model can combine
historical and predicted path transitions to generate the optimal path
transition sequences, along with the policy to guide the mutation strategy of
fuzzing. Finally, to exercise the high-reward path transition sequence, we
propose the concept of an action group, which comprehensively optimizes the
critical steps of fuzzing to realize the optimal path to reach the target
efficiently.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MAAD是一个基于多智能体系统的自动化软件架构设计框架，通过四个专业智能体协作生成架构蓝图和评估报告，优于现有基线方法，并在实际应用中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统软件架构设计依赖人工，效率低且设计选择有限，尤其是在敏捷开发环境下。基于LLM的智能体在软件工程任务中表现优异，但在架构设计中的应用仍需探索。

Method: 提出MAAD框架，利用多智能体系统（包括分析、建模、设计和评估四个智能体）协作完成架构设计，并通过案例研究和对比实验验证其效果。

Result: MAAD在生成全面架构组件和结构化评估报告方面优于MetaGPT，工业界反馈证实其实用性。GPT-4o在三种LLM中表现最佳。

Conclusion: MAAD为自动化架构设计提供了高效解决方案，强调了LLM选择对多智能体系统性能的重要性。

Abstract: Software architecture design is a critical, yet inherently complex and
knowledge-intensive phase of software development. It requires deep domain
expertise, development experience, architectural knowledge, careful trade-offs
among competing quality attributes, and the ability to adapt to evolving
requirements. Traditionally, this process is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, and relies heavily on architects, often resulting in limited
design alternatives, especially under the pressures of agile development. While
Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promising performance across
various SE tasks, their application to architecture design remains relatively
scarce and requires more exploration, particularly in light of diverse domain
knowledge and complex decision-making. To address the challenges, we proposed
MAAD (Multi-Agent Architecture Design), an automated framework that employs a
knowledge-driven Multi-Agent System (MAS) for architecture design. MAAD
orchestrates four specialized agents (i.e., Analyst, Modeler, Designer and
Evaluator) to collaboratively interpret requirements specifications and produce
architectural blueprints enriched with quality attributes-based evaluation
reports. We then evaluated MAAD through a case study and comparative
experiments against MetaGPT, a state-of-the-art MAS baseline. Our results show
that MAAD's superiority lies in generating comprehensive architectural
components and delivering insightful and structured architecture evaluation
reports. Feedback from industrial architects across 11 requirements
specifications further reinforces MAAD's practical usability. We finally
explored the performance of the MAAD framework with three LLMs (GPT-4o,
DeepSeek-R1, and Llama 3.3) and found that GPT-4o exhibits better performance
in producing architecture design, emphasizing the importance of LLM selection
in MAS-driven architecture design.

TL;DR: HLSDebugger提出了一种针对HLS逻辑调试的定制解决方案，通过生成大规模标注数据集和采用编码器-解码器结构，显著提升了调试效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HLS代码调试对缺乏硬件领域知识的新手或软件工程师来说是一项挑战，LLMs的应用潜力巨大但面临数据稀缺、逻辑复杂和多任务需求等挑战。

Method: HLSDebugger生成300K标注数据集，采用编码器-解码器结构，同时完成错误定位、类型预测和修正。

Result: HLSDebugger在错误识别和修正上显著优于GPT-4等先进LLMs，修正效率提升3倍以上。

Conclusion: HLSDebugger为HLS代码自动调试提供了重要进展。

Abstract: High-level synthesis (HLS) accelerates hardware design by enabling the
automatic translation of high-level descriptions into efficient hardware
implementations. However, debugging HLS code is a challenging and
labor-intensive task, especially for novice circuit designers or software
engineers without sufficient hardware domain knowledge. The recent emergence of
Large Language Models (LLMs) is promising in automating the HLS debugging
process. Despite the great potential, three key challenges persist when
applying LLMs to HLS logic debugging: 1) High-quality circuit data for training
LLMs is scarce, posing a significant challenge. 2) Debugging logic bugs in
hardware is inherently more complex than identifying software bugs with
existing golden test cases. 3) The absence of reliable test cases requires
multi-tasking solutions, performing both bug identification and correction.
complicates the multi-tasking required for effective HLS debugging. In this
work, we propose a customized solution named HLSDebugger to address the
challenges. HLSDebugger first generates and releases a large labeled dataset
with 300K data samples, targeting HLS logic bugs. The HLSDebugger model adopts
an encoder-decoder structure, performing bug location identification, bug type
prediction, and bug correction with the same model. HLSDebugger significantly
outperforms advanced LLMs like GPT-4 in bug identification and by more than 3x
in bug correction. It makes a substantial advancement in the exploration of
automated debugging of HLS code.

Result: MultiAIGCD数据集包含12万AI代码和3万人类代码，检测模型在跨模型和跨语言场景中表现不一。

Conclusion: MultiAIGCD为AI生成代码检测研究提供了重要资源，未来需进一步优化检测模型。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) rapidly advance, their role in code
generation has expanded significantly. While this offers streamlined
development, it also creates concerns in areas like education and job
interviews. Consequently, developing robust systems to detect AI-generated code
is imperative to maintain academic integrity and ensure fairness in hiring
processes. In this study, we introduce MultiAIGCD, a dataset for AI-generated
code detection for Python, Java, and Go. From the CodeNet dataset's problem
definitions and human-authored codes, we generate several code samples in Java,
Python, and Go with six different LLMs and three different prompts. This
generation process covered three key usage scenarios: (i) generating code from
problem descriptions, (ii) fixing runtime errors in human-written code, and
(iii) correcting incorrect outputs. Overall, MultiAIGCD consists of 121,271
AI-generated and 32,148 human-written code snippets. We also benchmark three
state-of-the-art AI-generated code detection models and assess their
performance in various test scenarios such as cross-model and cross-language.
We share our dataset and codes to support research in this field.

Conclusion: 论文提出了涵盖人类、技术和组织三个方向的未来研究议程，以指导这一范式的进一步探索。

Abstract: Software development is undergoing a fundamental transformation as vibe
coding becomes widespread, with large portions of contemporary codebases now
being AI-generated. The disconnect between rapid adoption and limited
conceptual understanding highlights the need for an inquiry into this emerging
paradigm. Drawing on an intent perspective and historical analysis, we define
vibe coding as a software development paradigm where humans and generative AI
engage in collaborative flow to co-create software artifacts through natural
language dialogue, shifting the mediation of developer intent from
deterministic instruction to probabilistic inference. By intent mediation, we
refer to the fundamental process through which developers translate their
conceptual goals into representations that computational systems can execute.
Our results show that vibe coding reconfigures cognitive work by redistributing
epistemic labor between humans and machines, shifting the expertise in the
software development process away from traditional areas such as design or
technical implementation toward collaborative orchestration. We identify key
opportunities, including democratization, acceleration, and systemic leverage,
alongside risks, such as black box codebases, responsibility gaps, and
ecosystem bias. We conclude with a research agenda spanning human-,
technology-, and organization-centered directions to guide future
investigations of this paradigm.

TL;DR: 本文研究了预训练代码语言模型（CodeLMs）在跨语言错误（CLB）检测中的潜力，开发了工具CLCFinder并构建了数据集，发现微调后模型性能提升，但小模型表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言编程中跨语言错误（CLB）难以检测，现有单语言工具无法解决，因此探索预训练代码语言模型的应用。

Method: 开发CLCFinder工具，构建包含三种编程语言组合的数据集，微调13种CodeLMs并评估性能，分析数据集大小、序列长度和代码注释的影响。

Result: 微调后模型性能显著提升，UniXcoder-base表现最佳（F1=0.7407）；小模型优于大模型；单语言错误数据集微调的模型对CLB检测效果差。

Conclusion: CodeLMs在CLB检测中潜力显著，但需针对性微调；数据集大小是关键因素，而序列长度和代码注释影响因模型而异。

Abstract: Multilingual programming, which involves using multiple programming languages
(PLs) in a single project, is increasingly common due to its benefits. However,
it introduces cross-language bugs (CLBs), which arise from interactions between
different PLs and are difficult to detect by single-language bug detection
tools. This paper investigates the potential of pre-trained code language
models (CodeLMs) in CLB detection. We developed CLCFinder, a cross-language
code identification tool, and constructed a CLB dataset involving three PL
combinations (Python-C/C++, Java-C/C++, and Python-Java) with nine interaction
types. We fine-tuned 13 CodeLMs on this dataset and evaluated their
performance, analyzing the effects of dataset size, token sequence length, and
code comments. Results show that all CodeLMs performed poorly before
fine-tuning, but exhibited varying degrees of performance improvement after
fine-tuning, with UniXcoder-base achieving the best F1 score (0.7407). Notably,
small fine-tuned CodeLMs tended to performe better than large ones. CodeLMs
fine-tuned on single-language bug datasets performed poorly on CLB detection,
demonstrating the distinction between CLBs and single-language bugs.
Additionally, increasing the fine-tuning dataset size significantly improved
performance, while longer token sequences did not necessarily improve the model
performance. The impact of code comments varied across models. Some fine-tuned
CodeLMs' performance was improved, while others showed degraded performance.

Result: 嵌入空间不是流形，而是分层空间，局部维度随点变化；RL代理的潜在表示在低维和高维间交替。

Conclusion: 分层潜在空间的维度分布可作为RL游戏复杂性的新几何指标。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the structure of the embedding space of a
transformer model trained for playing a particular reinforcement learning (RL)
game. Specifically, we investigate how a transformer-based Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) model embeds visual inputs in a simple environment where an
agent must collect "coins" while avoiding dynamic obstacles consisting of
"spotlights." By adapting Robinson et al.'s study of the volume growth
transform for LLMs to the RL setting, we find that the token embedding space
for our visual coin collecting game is also not a manifold, and is better
modeled as a stratified space, where local dimension can vary from point to
point. We further strengthen Robinson's method by proving that fairly general
volume growth curves can be realized by stratified spaces. Finally, we carry
out an analysis that suggests that as an RL agent acts, its latent
representation alternates between periods of low local dimension, while
following a fixed sub-strategy, and bursts of high local dimension, where the
agent achieves a sub-goal (e.g., collecting an object) or where the
environmental complexity increases (e.g., more obstacles appear). Consequently,
our work suggests that the distribution of dimensions in a stratified latent
space may provide a new geometric indicator of complexity for RL games.

Result: 配置矩阵在结合基数语义算子的类型、参数和连接拓扑信息中起关键作用。

Conclusion: CAO可建模为动态系统，配置矩阵是其核心组成部分。

Abstract: The foundational concepts of semantic numeration systems theory are briefly
outlined. The action of cardinal semantic operators unfolds over a set of
cardinal abstract entities belonging to the cardinal semantic multeity. The
cardinal abstract object (CAO) formed by them in a certain connectivity
topology is proposed to be considered as a linear discrete dynamical system
with nonlinear control. Under the assumption of ideal observability, the CAO
state equations are provided for both stationary and non-stationary cases. The
fundamental role of the configuration matrix, which combines information about
the types of cardinal semantic operators in the CAO, their parameters and
topology of connectivity, is demonstrated.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于图神经网络（GNN）的离散选择模型（GNN-DCMs），用于解决传统深度学习方法无法显式捕捉选择替代方案之间关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法在离散选择分析中表现优异，但无法显式捕捉替代方案之间的关系，而这是经典离散选择模型的核心关注点。

Method: 引入GNN框架，通过消息传递机制捕捉空间替代方案之间的依赖关系，同时保持与经典随机效用理论的联系。

Result: GNN-DCMs在芝加哥77个社区区域的住宅选址预测中表现优于MNL、SCL和前馈神经网络，并能捕捉个体异质性和空间感知的替代模式。

Conclusion: GNN-DCMs为复杂空间选择背景下离散选择建模与深度学习的结合提供了统一且表达力强的框架。

Abstract: Researchers have adopted deep learning for classical discrete choice analysis
as it can capture complex feature relationships and achieve higher predictive
performance. However, the existing deep learning approaches cannot explicitly
capture the relationship among choice alternatives, which has been a
long-lasting focus in classical discrete choice models. To address the gap,
this paper introduces Graph Neural Network (GNN) as a novel framework to
analyze residential location choice. The GNN-based discrete choice models
(GNN-DCMs) offer a structured approach for neural networks to capture
dependence among spatial alternatives, while maintaining clear connections to
classical random utility theory. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the
GNN-DCMs incorporate the nested logit (NL) model and the spatially correlated
logit (SCL) model as two specific cases, yielding novel algorithmic
interpretation through message passing among alternatives' utilities.
Empirically, the GNN-DCMs outperform benchmark MNL, SCL, and feedforward neural
networks in predicting residential location choices among Chicago's 77
community areas. Regarding model interpretation, the GNN-DCMs can capture
individual heterogeneity and exhibit spatially-aware substitution patterns.
Overall, these results highlight the potential of GNN-DCMs as a unified and
expressive framework for synergizing discrete choice modeling and deep learning
in the complex spatial choice contexts.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文通过证明在神经切线核（NTK）稳定性假设下，局部满足Polyak-Lojasiewicz（PL）条件，解释了梯度下降（GD）在深度神经网络（DNNs）中观察到的指数收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决梯度下降在非凸损失函数中收敛速率理论与实际观察不一致的问题。

Method: 引入局部Polyak-Lojasiewicz区域（LPLR）概念，证明有限宽度网络在初始化附近存在LPLR，并分析梯度下降在LPLR内的线性收敛性。

Result: 理论验证了梯度下降在LPLR内实现线性收敛，匹配了实际观察到的速率，并在多种实验设置中得到验证。

Conclusion: 通过NTK框架将局部几何结构与快速优化连接，为深度学习梯度优化的高效性提供了理论解释。

Abstract: The convergence of gradient descent (GD) on the non-convex loss landscapes of
deep neural networks (DNNs) presents a fundamental theoretical challenge. While
recent work has established that GD converges to a stationary point at a
sublinear rate within locally quasi-convex regions (LQCRs), this fails to
explain the exponential convergence rates consistently observed in practice. In
this paper, we resolve this discrepancy by proving that under a mild assumption
on Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) stability, these same regions satisfy a local
Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition. We introduce the concept of a Locally
Polyak-Lojasiewicz Region (LPLR), where the squared gradient norm lower-bounds
the suboptimality gap, prove that properly initialized finite-width networks
admit such regions around initialization, and establish that GD achieves linear
convergence within an LPLR, providing the first finite-width guarantee that
matches empirically observed rates. We validate our theory across diverse
settings, from controlled experiments on fully-connected networks to modern
ResNet architectures trained with stochastic methods, demonstrating that LPLR
structure emerges robustly in practical deep learning scenarios. By rigorously
connecting local landscape geometry to fast optimization through the NTK
framework, our work provides a definitive theoretical explanation for the
remarkable efficiency of gradient-based optimization in deep learning.

### [346] [Measuring Sample Quality with Copula Discrepancies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21434)
*Agnideep Aich,Ashit Baran Aich,Bruce Wade*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Copula Discrepancy (CD)的诊断方法，用于评估近似MCMC采样器的依赖结构质量，解决了传统方法在偏差采样器上的失效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代贝叶斯机器学习中的可扩展MCMC算法（如SGLD）牺牲了渐近精确性以换取计算速度，导致传统样本质量诊断方法在偏差采样器上失效。

Method: 通过Sklar定理，CD能够独立于边缘分布量化样本的依赖结构保真度，提供了一种结构感知的诊断工具。

Result: 实验表明，CD在超参数选择中显著优于传统方法（如有效样本量），并能检测尾部依赖的细微差异。

Conclusion: CD不仅为MCMC实践者提供了实用价值，还为下一代结构感知样本质量评估奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: The scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that underpin modern
Bayesian machine learning, such as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics
(SGLD), sacrifice asymptotic exactness for computational speed, creating a
critical diagnostic gap: traditional sample quality measures fail
catastrophically when applied to biased samplers. While powerful Stein-based
diagnostics can detect distributional mismatches, they provide no direct
assessment of dependence structure, often the primary inferential target in
multivariate problems. We introduce the Copula Discrepancy (CD), a principled
and computationally efficient diagnostic that leverages Sklar's theorem to
isolate and quantify the fidelity of a sample's dependence structure
independent of its marginals. Our theoretical framework provides the first
structure-aware diagnostic specifically designed for the era of approximate
inference. Empirically, we demonstrate that a moment-based CD dramatically
outperforms standard diagnostics like effective sample size for hyperparameter
selection in biased MCMC, correctly identifying optimal configurations where
traditional methods fail. Furthermore, our robust MLE-based variant can detect
subtle but critical mismatches in tail dependence that remain invisible to rank
correlation-based approaches, distinguishing between samples with identical
Kendall's tau but fundamentally different extreme-event behavior. With
computational overhead orders of magnitude lower than existing Stein
discrepancies, the CD provides both immediate practical value for MCMC
practitioners and a theoretical foundation for the next generation of
structure-aware sample quality assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解SGMCMC算法在退化损失景观中的行为，填补现有理论假设与实际情况之间的差距。

Method: 引入一种可扩展的基准来评估SGMCMC算法的局部采样性能，并测试多种常见算法。

Result: RMSProp预处理的SGLD在反映后验分布局部几何特性方面表现最佳，且能在参数规模达O(100M)的模型中提取非平凡的局部信息。

Conclusion: 尽管缺乏全局收敛的理论保证，但局部采样方法在退化损失景观中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Degeneracy is an inherent feature of the loss landscape of neural networks,
but it is not well understood how stochastic gradient MCMC (SGMCMC) algorithms
interact with this degeneracy. In particular, current global convergence
guarantees for common SGMCMC algorithms rely on assumptions which are likely
incompatible with degenerate loss landscapes. In this paper, we argue that this
gap requires a shift in focus from global to local posterior sampling, and, as
a first step, we introduce a novel scalable benchmark for evaluating the local
sampling performance of SGMCMC algorithms. We evaluate a number of common
algorithms, and find that RMSProp-preconditioned SGLD is most effective at
faithfully representing the local geometry of the posterior distribution.
Although we lack theoretical guarantees about global sampler convergence, our
empirical results show that we are able to extract non-trivial local
information in models with up to O(100M) parameters.

Abstract: Forest transitions, characterized by dynamic shifts between forest,
agricultural, and abandoned lands, are complex phenomena. This study developed
a stochastic differential equation model to capture the intricate dynamics of
these transitions. We established the existence of global positive solutions
for the model and conducted numerical analyses to assess the impact of model
parameters on deforestation incentives. To address the challenge of parameter
estimation, we proposed a novel deep learning approach that estimates all model
parameters from a single sample containing time-series observations of forest
and agricultural land proportions. This innovative approach enables us to
understand forest transition dynamics and deforestation trends at any future
time.

Motivation: 探索从有限样本中推断任意连续概率分布的性质，特别是基于排序样本点的非参数方法。

Method: 利用顺序统计量的基本性质，分析N个排序样本点对实数线的分割及其概率质量分布。

Result: 发现每段概率质量期望为1/(N+1)，离散熵为log2(N+1)比特，与Shannon的连续变量结果形成对比。

Conclusion: 该框架为非参数推断（如密度和尾部估计）提供了新的视角，并与传统ECDF方法进行了比较。

Abstract: This paper investigates what can be inferred about an arbitrary continuous
probability distribution from a finite sample of $N$ observations drawn from
it. The central finding is that the $N$ sorted sample points partition the real
line into $N+1$ segments, each carrying an expected probability mass of exactly
$1/(N+1)$. This non-parametric result, which follows from fundamental
properties of order statistics, holds regardless of the underlying
distribution's shape. This equal-probability partition yields a discrete
entropy of $\log_2(N+1)$ bits, which quantifies the information gained from the
sample and contrasts with Shannon's results for continuous variables. I compare
this partition-based framework to the conventional ECDF and discuss its
implications for robust non-parametric inference, particularly in density and
tail estimation.

TL;DR: 论文提出MIBoost算法，扩展了梯度提升框架，通过统一的变量选择机制处理多重插补数据集，性能与现有方法相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统计学习方法（如LASSO、弹性网络、梯度提升）在缺失数据情况下分析复杂，现有模型选择方法存在不足。

Method: 提出MIBoost算法，基于组件梯度提升框架，统一处理多重插补数据集。

Result: 模拟研究表明，MIBoost的预测性能与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: MIBoost为多重插补数据集提供了一种有效的变量选择方法。

Abstract: Statistical learning methods for automated variable selection, such as LASSO,
elastic nets, or gradient boosting, have become increasingly popular tools for
building powerful prediction models. Yet, in practice, analyses are often
complicated by missing data. The most widely used approach to address
missingness is multiple imputation, which creates several completed datasets.
However, there is an ongoing debate on how to perform model selection in the
presence of multiple imputed datasets. Simple strategies, such as pooling
models across datasets, have been shown to have suboptimal properties. Although
more sophisticated methods exist, they are often difficult to implement and
therefore not widely applied. In contrast, two recent approaches modify the
regularization methods LASSO and elastic nets by defining a single loss
function, resulting in a unified set of coefficients across imputations. Our
key contribution is to extend this principle to the framework of component-wise
gradient boosting by proposing MIBoost, a novel algorithm that employs a
uniform variable-selection mechanism across imputed datasets. Simulation
studies suggest that our approach yields prediction performance comparable to
that of these recently proposed methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式AI在芯片验证领域的应用仍处于探索阶段，而验证是芯片开发周期中的关键瓶颈。本文旨在通过多智能体协作解决单一大语言模型的局限性。

Method: 构建了一个多智能体协作的自动化系统，包括规范解析、验证策略生成和代码实现等步骤，将设计规范转化为测试台。

Result: 在多个复杂度不同的芯片模块验证实验中，MAVF在验证文档解析、生成及自动化测试台生成方面显著优于传统手动方法和单一大语言模型方法。

Conclusion: MAVF为生成式AI在验证自动化中的应用开辟了新方向，有望解决芯片设计中最具挑战性的瓶颈问题。

Abstract: As large language models demonstrate enormous potential in the field of
Electronic Design Automation (EDA), generative AI-assisted chip design is
attracting widespread attention from academia and industry. Although these
technologies have made preliminary progress in tasks such as code generation,
their application in chip verification -- a critical bottleneck in the chip
development cycle -- remains at an exploratory stage. This paper proposes an
innovative Multi-Agent Verification Framework (MAVF) aimed at addressing the
limitations of current single-LLM approaches in complex verification tasks. Our
framework builds an automated transformation system from design specifications
to testbench through the collaborative work of multiple specialized agents,
including specification parsing, verification strategy generation, and code
implementation. Through verification experiments on multiple chip modules of
varying complexity, results show that MAVF significantly outperforms
traditional manual methods and single-dialogue generative AI approaches in
verification document parsing and generation, as well as automated testbench
generation. This research opens new directions for exploring generative AI
applications in verification automation, potentially providing effective
approaches to solving the most challenging bottleneck issues in chip design.

Result: AI可能进一步削弱医患关系，威胁医疗专业和患者满意度。

Conclusion: AI在医疗中的应用需谨慎，以避免对医患关系产生负面影响。

Abstract: In the much-celebrated book Deep Medicine, Eric Topol argues that the
development of artificial intelligence for health care will lead to a dramatic
shift in the culture and practice of medicine. In the next several decades, he
suggests, AI will become sophisticated enough that many of the everyday tasks
of physicians could be delegated to it. Topol is perhaps the most articulate
advocate of the benefits of AI in medicine, but he is hardly alone in spruiking
its potential to allow physicians to dedicate more of their time and attention
to providing empathetic care for their patients in the future. Unfortunately,
several factors suggest a radically different picture for the future of health
care. Far from facilitating a return to a time of closer doctor-patient
relationships, the use of medical AI seems likely to further erode therapeutic
relationships and threaten professional and patient satisfaction.

Result: 实验基于OULAD数据集，结果显示方法对预测MOOC学习者失败有潜力，预测准确性受记录交互量的影响。

Conclusion: 研究表明，丰富多样的行为数据对预测准确性至关重要，方法在MOOC中有应用前景。

Abstract: MOOCs offer free and open access to a wide audience, but completion rates
remain low, often due to a lack of personalized content. To address this issue,
it is essential to predict learner performance in order to provide tailored
feedback. Behavioral traces-such as clicks and events-can be analyzed as time
series to anticipate learners' outcomes. This work compares multivariate time
series classification methods to identify at-risk learners at different stages
of the course (after 5, 10 weeks, etc.). The experimental evaluation, conducted
on the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD), focuses on three
courses: two in STEM and one in SHS. Preliminary results show that the
evaluated approaches are promising for predicting learner failure in MOOCs. The
analysis also suggests that prediction accuracy is influenced by the amount of
recorded interactions, highlighting the importance of rich and diverse
behavioral data.

Abstract: In the interconnected world, news media are critical in conveying information
to public across diverse domains including technology, finance, and
agriculture. Journalists make efforts to present accurate information, however,
the interpretation of news often varies significantly among different audiences
due to their specific expertise and age. In this work, we investigate how to
identify these comprehension gaps and provide solutions to improve audiences
understanding of news content, particular to the aspects of articles outside
their primary domains of knowledge. We propose a agent-based framework using
large language models (LLMs) to simulate society communication behaviors, where
several agents can discuss news. These agents can be designed to be experts
from various occupation, or from different age group. Our results indicate that
this framework can identify confusions or even misunderstanding of news for the
agent through the iterative discussion process. Based on these accurate
identification, the framework can design a supplement material specific to
these agents on the news. Our results show that agents exhibit significantly
improved news understanding after receiving this material. These findings
highlight our framework's utility and efficiency in enhancing news
comprehension for diverse audiences by directly addressing their understanding
gap.

Result: 研究发现9个核心价值和32种价值错位，这些错位对用户产生了负面影响。

Conclusion: 研究为对话代理提供商提供了可操作的见解，以实现更具情境敏感性的价值对齐。

Abstract: Conversational agents (CAs) based on generative artificial intelligence
frequently face challenges ensuring ethical interactions that align with human
values. Current value alignment efforts largely rely on top-down approaches,
such as technical guidelines or legal value principles. However, these methods
tend to be disconnected from the specific contexts in which CAs operate,
potentially leading to misalignment with users interests. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel, bottom-up approach to value alignment, utilizing
the value ontology of the ISO Value-Based Engineering standard for ethical IT
design. We analyse 593 ethically sensitive system outputs identified from
16,908 conversational logs of a major European employment service CA to
identify core values and instances of value misalignment within real-world
interactions. The results revealed nine core values and 32 different value
misalignments that negatively impacted users. Our findings provide actionable
insights for CA providers seeking to address ethical challenges and achieve
more context-sensitive value alignment.

Conclusion: ChatGPT在高等教育评估中具有潜力，可进一步优化以提升效率。

Abstract: Large language models have been widely applied in many aspects of real life,
bringing significant efficiency to businesses and offering distinctive user
experiences. In this paper, we focus on exploring the application of ChatGPT, a
chatbot based on a large language model, to support higher educator in
generating quiz questions and assessing learners. Specifically, we explore
interactive prompting patterns to design an optimal AI-powered question bank
creation process. The generated questions are evaluated through a "Blind test"
survey sent to various stakeholders including lecturers and learners. Initial
results at the Banking Academy of Vietnam are relatively promising, suggesting
a potential direction to streamline the time and effort involved in assessing
learners at higher education institutes.

TL;DR: 反对AGI竞赛的观点，认为其风险高、收益低，国际合作是更好的替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AGI竞赛的负面影响，提出国际合作作为更优选择。

Method: 分析AGI竞赛的潜在风险和收益，对比国际合作的优势。

Result: AGI竞赛风险高、收益有限，国际合作更具可行性。

Conclusion: 应避免AGI竞赛，转向国际合作以降低风险并实现共同利益。

Abstract: AGI Racing is the view that it is in the self-interest of major actors in AI
development, especially powerful nations, to accelerate their frontier AI
development to build highly capable AI, especially artificial general
intelligence (AGI), before competitors have a chance. We argue against AGI
Racing. First, the downsides of racing to AGI are much higher than portrayed by
this view. Racing to AGI would substantially increase catastrophic risks from
AI, including nuclear instability, and undermine the prospects of technical AI
safety research to be effective. Second, the expected benefits of racing may be
lower than proponents of AGI Racing hold. In particular, it is questionable
whether winning the race enables complete domination over losers. Third,
international cooperation and coordination, and perhaps carefully crafted
deterrence measures, constitute viable alternatives to racing to AGI which have
much smaller risks and promise to deliver most of the benefits that racing to
AGI is supposed to provide. Hence, racing to AGI is not in anyone's
self-interest as other actions, particularly incentivizing and seeking
international cooperation around AI issues, are preferable.

*Ananya Anand*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: 研究利用机器学习模型预测剖宫产后阴道分娩（VBAC）的成功率，基于64万例数据，MLP模型表现最佳（AUC=0.7287）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测剖宫产后试产（TOLAC）的结果对产前咨询和降低分娩风险至关重要。

Method: 使用CDC WONDER Natality数据集（2017-2023），筛选643,029例单胎分娩数据，训练逻辑回归、XGBoost和MLP三种分类器，并采用类别加权和自定义损失函数处理类别不平衡。

Result: MLP模型表现最佳（AUC=0.7287），XGBoost次之（AUC=0.727），均优于逻辑回归（AUC=0.709）。关键预测因素包括BMI、教育水平、产次等。

Conclusion: 常规收集的早期妊娠变量可用于构建中等高表现的VBAC预测模型，支持临床决策。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the outcome of a trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC)
is essential for guiding prenatal counseling and minimizing delivery-related
risks. This study presents supervised machine learning models for predicting
vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) using 643,029 TOLAC cases from the CDC
WONDER Natality dataset (2017-2023). After filtering for singleton births with
one or two prior cesareans and complete data across 47 prenatal-period
features, three classifiers were trained: logistic regression, XGBoost, and a
multilayer perceptron (MLP). The MLP achieved the highest performance with an
AUC of 0.7287, followed closely by XGBoost (AUC = 0.727), both surpassing the
logistic regression baseline (AUC = 0.709). To address class imbalance, class
weighting was applied to the MLP, and a custom loss function was implemented in
XGBoost. Evaluation metrics included ROC curves, confusion matrices, and
precision-recall analysis. Logistic regression coefficients highlighted
maternal BMI, education, parity, comorbidities, and prenatal care indicators as
key predictors. Overall, the results demonstrate that routinely collected,
early-pregnancy variables can support scalable and moderately high-performing
VBAC prediction models. These models offer potential utility in clinical
decision support, particularly in settings lacking access to specialized
intrapartum data.

Motivation: 解决临床预测模型在多中心ICU数据中因分布偏移导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 应用锚回归并引入锚提升（一种基于树的非线性扩展），在大规模数据集（40万患者，9个ICU数据库）上进行验证。

Result: 锚正则化显著提升了分布外性能，尤其对差异最大的目标域效果明显，且对理论假设的违反具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出了量化外部数据效用的新框架，并定义了三种数据使用模式：领域泛化、领域适应和数据丰富模式。

Abstract: The performance of predictive models in clinical settings often degrades when
deployed in new hospitals due to distribution shifts. This paper presents a
large-scale study of causality-inspired domain generalization on heterogeneous
multi-center intensive care unit (ICU) data. We apply anchor regression and
introduce anchor boosting, a novel, tree-based nonlinear extension, to a large
dataset comprising 400,000 patients from nine distinct ICU databases. The
anchor regularization consistently improves out-of-distribution performance,
particularly for the most dissimilar target domains. The methods appear robust
to violations of theoretical assumptions, such as anchor exogeneity.
Furthermore, we propose a novel conceptual framework to quantify the utility of
large external data datasets. By evaluating performance as a function of
available target-domain data, we identify three regimes: (i) a domain
generalization regime, where only the external model should be used, (ii) a
domain adaptation regime, where refitting the external model is optimal, and
(iii) a data-rich regime, where external data provides no additional value.

Method: OneShield提供定义风险因素、表达上下文安全与合规策略以及缓解LLM风险的功能，专注于满足每个客户的具体需求。

Result: 论文描述了OneShield框架的实现、可扩展性考虑以及自首次部署以来的使用统计数据。

Conclusion: OneShield为LLMs提供了一种灵活且针对性的保护方案，解决了现有通用解决方案的不足。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models has created a general excitement about the
great potential for a myriad of applications. While LLMs offer many
possibilities, questions about safety, privacy, and ethics have emerged, and
all the key actors are working to address these issues with protective measures
for their own models and standalone solutions. The constantly evolving nature
of LLMs makes the task of universally shielding users against their potential
risks extremely challenging, and one-size-fits-all solutions unfeasible. In
this work, we propose OneShield, our stand-alone, model-agnostic and
customizable solution to safeguard LLMs. OneShield aims to provide facilities
for defining risk factors, expressing and declaring contextual safety and
compliance policies, and mitigating LLM risks, with a focus on each specific
customer. We describe the implementation of the framework, the scalability
considerations and provide usage statistics of OneShield since its first
deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在医疗诊断中的快速应用引发了对患者隐私的担忧，尤其是敏感影像数据的传输、存储和处理。

Method: 采用改进的卷积神经网络（Masked-CNN）在加密或转换后的图像格式上进行诊断推断，结合AES-CBC加密和JPEG2000压缩。

Result: 在公共DICOM数据集上评估，加密模型性能接近未加密模型，仅在准确性和延迟上有微小牺牲。

Conclusion: 该框架在数据隐私与临床实用性之间取得平衡，为安全的AI驱动诊断提供了实用、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into medical
diagnostics has raised pressing concerns about patient privacy, especially when
sensitive imaging data must be transferred, stored, or processed. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework for privacy-preserving diagnostic inference
on encrypted medical images using a modified convolutional neural network
(Masked-CNN) capable of operating on transformed or ciphered image formats. Our
approach leverages AES-CBC encryption coupled with JPEG2000 compression to
protect medical images while maintaining their suitability for AI inference. We
evaluate the system using public DICOM datasets (NIH ChestX-ray14 and
LIDC-IDRI), focusing on diagnostic accuracy, inference latency, storage
efficiency, and privacy leakage resistance. Experimental results show that the
encrypted inference model achieves performance comparable to its unencrypted
counterpart, with only marginal trade-offs in accuracy and latency. The
proposed framework bridges the gap between data privacy and clinical utility,
offering a practical, scalable solution for secure AI-driven diagnostics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D点云分类模型在关键应用（如自动驾驶）中存在安全漏洞，现有黑盒攻击方法效果不佳，需要改进。

Result: 提出的方法在不依赖模型内部信息的情况下，提高了黑盒攻击的成功率和隐蔽性。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D点云分类模型的安全评估提供了更实用的黑盒攻击工具。

Abstract: Adversarial attack methods for 3D point cloud classification reveal the
vulnerabilities of point cloud recognition models. This vulnerability could
lead to safety risks in critical applications that use deep learning models,
such as autonomous vehicles. To uncover the deficiencies of these models,
researchers can evaluate their security through adversarial attacks. However,
most existing adversarial attack methods are based on white-box attacks. While
these methods achieve high attack success rates and imperceptibility, their
applicability in real-world scenarios is limited. Black-box attacks, which are
more meaningful in real-world scenarios, often yield poor results. This paper
proposes a novel black-box adversarial example generation method that utilizes
a diffusion model to improve the attack success rate and imperceptibility in
the black-box setting, without relying on the internal information of the point
cloud classification model to generate adversarial samples. We use a 3D
diffusion model to use the compressed features of the point cloud as prior
knowledge to guide the reverse diffusion process to add adversarial points to
clean examples. Subsequently, its reverse process is employed to transform the
distribution of other categories into adversarial points, which are then added
to the point cloud.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FedBAP是一种新的联邦学习防御框架，通过减少模型对后门触发器的依赖来抵御后门攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习防御方法因忽视模型对后门触发器的过度依赖而效果有限，尤其是在恶意客户端比例增加时。

Method: 提出扰动触发器生成机制、生成良性对抗扰动以破坏模型对后门触发器的依赖，并设计自适应缩放机制动态调整扰动强度。

Result: 实验显示，FedBAP在三种后门攻击下分别将攻击成功率降低0.22%-5.34%、0.48%-6.34%和97.22%-97.6%。

Conclusion: FedBAP能有效抵御后门攻击，尤其在新颖后门攻击中表现突出。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving
data privacy, but it is highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Most existing
defense methods in FL have limited effectiveness due to their neglect of the
model's over-reliance on backdoor triggers, particularly as the proportion of
malicious clients increases. In this paper, we propose FedBAP, a novel defense
framework for mitigating backdoor attacks in FL by reducing the model's
reliance on backdoor triggers. Specifically, first, we propose a perturbed
trigger generation mechanism that creates perturbation triggers precisely
matching backdoor triggers in location and size, ensuring strong influence on
model outputs. Second, we utilize these perturbation triggers to generate
benign adversarial perturbations that disrupt the model's dependence on
backdoor triggers while forcing it to learn more robust decision boundaries.
Finally, we design an adaptive scaling mechanism to dynamically adjust
perturbation intensity, effectively balancing defense strength and model
performance. The experimental results demonstrate that FedBAP reduces the
attack success rates by 0.22%-5.34%, 0.48%-6.34%, and 97.22%-97.6% under three
types of backdoor attacks, respectively. In particular, FedBAP demonstrates
outstanding performance against novel backdoor attacks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于LLM的可解释异常检测系统，用于未来RAN环境中的DDoS攻击检测，结合LSTM模型和XAI方法，实现了高精度和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 下一代RAN需要增强安全性，特别是针对DDoS攻击的检测和解释，以支持5G/6G基础设施的安全。

Method: 使用LSTM模型分析从E2节点提取的多变量时间序列KPMs，结合LIME和SHAP进行局部解释，并利用LLM将技术解释转化为自然语言。

Result: 实验结果表明，该系统在真实5G网络KPMs上实现了高检测精度（F1-score > 0.96），并提供了可操作和可解释的输出。

Conclusion: 该框架为未来RAN环境中的安全威胁检测提供了一种高效且透明的解决方案。

Abstract: Next generation Radio Access Networks (RANs) introduce programmability,
intelligence, and near real-time control through intelligent controllers,
enabling enhanced security within the RAN and across broader 5G/6G
infrastructures. This paper presents a comprehensive survey highlighting
opportunities, challenges, and research gaps for Large Language Models
(LLMs)-assisted explainable (XAI) intrusion detection (IDS) for secure future
RAN environments. Motivated by this, we propose an LLM interpretable
anomaly-based detection system for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks
using multivariate time series key performance measures (KPMs), extracted from
E2 nodes, within the Near Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC).
An LSTM-based model is trained to identify malicious User Equipment (UE)
behavior based on these KPMs. To enhance transparency, we apply post-hoc local
explainability methods such as LIME and SHAP to interpret individual
predictions. Furthermore, LLMs are employed to convert technical explanations
into natural-language insights accessible to non-expert users. Experimental
results on real 5G network KPMs demonstrate that our framework achieves high
detection accuracy (F1-score > 0.96) while delivering actionable and
interpretable outputs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Hot-Swap MarkBoard的高效水印方法，用于保护分布式深度学习模型的IP，支持用户特定的水印定制，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习模型在终端设备上的部署增加，IP风险加剧，现有水印方法（如基于后门的水印）不适用于大规模分布式场景。

Method: 通过在多分支低秩适应（LoRA）模块中独立嵌入多个水印，实现高效定制；参数混淆机制防止水印被移除。

Result: 在三种任务和六种骨干模型上的实验表明，该方法效率高、适应性强，验证准确率达100%。

Conclusion: Hot-Swap MarkBoard是一种高效、灵活的水印方法，适用于多种模型架构和任务。

Abstract: Recently, Deep Learning (DL) models have been increasingly deployed on
end-user devices as On-Device AI, offering improved efficiency and privacy.
However, this deployment trend poses more serious Intellectual Property (IP)
risks, as models are distributed on numerous local devices, making them
vulnerable to theft and redistribution. Most existing ownership protection
solutions (e.g., backdoor-based watermarking) are designed for cloud-based
AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) and are not directly applicable to large-scale
distribution scenarios, where each user-specific model instance must carry a
unique watermark. These methods typically embed a fixed watermark, and
modifying the embedded watermark requires retraining the model. To address
these challenges, we propose Hot-Swap MarkBoard, an efficient watermarking
method. It encodes user-specific $n$-bit binary signatures by independently
embedding multiple watermarks into a multi-branch Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
module, enabling efficient watermark customization without retraining through
branch swapping. A parameter obfuscation mechanism further entangles the
watermark weights with those of the base model, preventing removal without
degrading model performance. The method supports black-box verification and is
compatible with various model architectures and DL tasks, including
classification, image generation, and text generation. Extensive experiments
across three types of tasks and six backbone models demonstrate our method's
superior efficiency and adaptability compared to existing approaches, achieving
100\% verification accuracy.

Result: 证明区块链的可扩展性并非权衡问题，而是工程结果，同时揭示了学术讨论中的系统性缺陷。

Conclusion: 提出了评估区块链研究主张的形式化标准，并指出了学术话语和同行评审中的问题。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive refutation of the so-called "blockchain
trilemma," a widely cited but formally ungrounded claim asserting an inherent
trade-off between decentralisation, security, and scalability in blockchain
protocols. Through formal analysis, empirical evidence, and detailed critique
of both methodology and terminology, we demonstrate that the trilemma rests on
semantic equivocation, misuse of distributed systems theory, and a failure to
define operational metrics. Particular focus is placed on the conflation of
topological network analogies with protocol-level architecture, the
mischaracterisation of Bitcoin's design--including the role of miners, SPV
clients, and header-based verification--and the failure to ground claims in
complexity-theoretic or adversarial models. By reconstructing Bitcoin as a
deterministic, stateless distribution protocol governed by evidentiary trust,
we show that scalability is not a trade-off but an engineering outcome. The
paper concludes by identifying systemic issues in academic discourse and peer
review that have allowed such fallacies to persist, and offers formal criteria
for evaluating future claims in blockchain research.

Method: 本文评估了两种核心检测范式：完全合成媒体的检测（基于统计异常和分层特征提取）和真实内容中篡改区域的定位（利用多模态线索）。

Result: 现有方法在受控环境中表现良好，但对对抗性扰动的鲁棒性不足。

Conclusion: 未来研究需优先提升对抗性鲁棒性，开发可扩展且模态无关的架构。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Generative Artificial Intelligence has fueled
deepfake proliferation-synthetic media encompassing fully generated content and
subtly edited authentic material-posing challenges to digital security,
misinformation mitigation, and identity preservation. This systematic review
evaluates state-of-the-art deepfake detection methodologies, emphasizing
reproducible implementations for transparency and validation. We delineate two
core paradigms: (1) detection of fully synthetic media leveraging statistical
anomalies and hierarchical feature extraction, and (2) localization of
manipulated regions within authentic content employing multi-modal cues such as
visual artifacts and temporal inconsistencies. These approaches, spanning
uni-modal and multi-modal frameworks, demonstrate notable precision and
adaptability in controlled settings, effectively identifying manipulations
through advanced learning techniques and cross-modal fusion. However,
comprehensive assessment reveals insufficient evaluation of adversarial
robustness across both paradigms. Current methods exhibit vulnerability to
adversarial perturbations-subtle alterations designed to evade
detection-undermining reliability in real-world adversarial contexts. This gap
highlights critical disconnect between methodological development and evolving
threat landscapes. To address this, we contribute a curated GitHub repository
aggregating open-source implementations, enabling replication and testing. Our
findings emphasize urgent need for future work prioritizing adversarial
resilience, advocating scalable, modality-agnostic architectures capable of
withstanding sophisticated manipulations. This review synthesizes strengths and
shortcomings of contemporary deepfake detection while charting paths toward
robust trustworthy systems.

Motivation: 研究如何评估机器学习模型对训练数据的隐私泄露程度，特别是在自适应和非自适应设置下。

Method: 在自适应设置中，提出CMIA框架，利用条件影子训练捕捉成员依赖关系；在非自适应设置中，提出PMIA方法，通过代理选择策略和影子模型行为进行推理。

Result: 实验表明，CMIA和PMIA在两种设置下均显著优于现有方法，尤其在低误报率场景下表现突出。

Conclusion: CMIA和PMIA为评估模型隐私风险提供了更有效的工具，尤其在关键的低误报率场景中。

Abstract: A Membership Inference Attack (MIA) assesses how much a trained machine
learning model reveals about its training data by determining whether specific
query instances were included in the dataset. We classify existing MIAs into
adaptive or non-adaptive, depending on whether the adversary is allowed to
train shadow models on membership queries. In the adaptive setting, where the
adversary can train shadow models after accessing query instances, we highlight
the importance of exploiting membership dependencies between instances and
propose an attack-agnostic framework called Cascading Membership Inference
Attack (CMIA), which incorporates membership dependencies via conditional
shadow training to boost membership inference performance.
  In the non-adaptive setting, where the adversary is restricted to training
shadow models before obtaining membership queries, we introduce Proxy
Membership Inference Attack (PMIA). PMIA employs a proxy selection strategy
that identifies samples with similar behaviors to the query instance and uses
their behaviors in shadow models to perform a membership posterior odds test
for membership inference. We provide theoretical analyses for both attacks, and
extensive experimental results demonstrate that CMIA and PMIA substantially
outperform existing MIAs in both settings, particularly in the low
false-positive regime, which is crucial for evaluating privacy risks.

Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）安全对齐机制仍易受复杂对抗攻击，尤其是那些利用模型多步推理能力的攻击。

Method: 受软件安全中的ROP技术启发，将有害指令分解为多个良性视觉小工具，并通过文本提示引导模型整合这些工具生成有害输出。

Result: 在SafeBench和MM-SafetyBench基准测试中，攻击成功率显著提升（SafeBench上超过0.90），ASR提高了0.39。

Conclusion: 揭示了LVLMs组合推理能力中的关键漏洞，强调了保护整个推理过程的紧迫性。

Abstract: The increasing sophistication of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has
been accompanied by advances in safety alignment mechanisms designed to prevent
harmful content generation. However, these defenses remain vulnerable to
sophisticated adversarial attacks. Existing jailbreak methods typically rely on
direct and semantically explicit prompts, overlooking subtle vulnerabilities in
how LVLMs compose information over multiple reasoning steps. In this paper, we
propose a novel and effective jailbreak framework inspired by Return-Oriented
Programming (ROP) techniques from software security. Our approach decomposes a
harmful instruction into a sequence of individually benign visual gadgets. A
carefully engineered textual prompt directs the sequence of inputs, prompting
the model to integrate the benign visual gadgets through its reasoning process
to produce a coherent and harmful output. This makes the malicious intent
emergent and difficult to detect from any single component. We validate our
method through extensive experiments on established benchmarks including
SafeBench and MM-SafetyBench, targeting popular LVLMs. Results show that our
approach consistently and substantially outperforms existing baselines on
state-of-the-art models, achieving near-perfect attack success rates (over 0.90
on SafeBench) and improving ASR by up to 0.39. Our findings reveal a critical
and underexplored vulnerability that exploits the compositional reasoning
abilities of LVLMs, highlighting the urgent need for defenses that secure the
entire reasoning process.

often embedded across these varied resources, each with their own arcane
discovery and extraction techniques. Therefore, large-scale privacy compliance
in adherence to governmental regulations requires systems to discern the
interconnected nature of diverse artifacts in a common, shared universe.
  We present Privacy Artifact ConnecT or (PACT), an embeddings-driven graph
that links millions of artifacts spanning multiple artifact types generated by
a variety of teams and projects. Powered by the state-of-the-art DRAGON
embedding model, PACT uses a contrastive learning objective with light
fine-tuning to link artifacts via their textual components such as raw
metadata, ownership specifics, and compliance context. Experimental results
show that PACT's fine-tuned model improves recall@1 from 18% to 53%, the query
match rate from 9.6% to 69.7% when paired with a baseline AI agent, and the
hitrate@1 from 25.7% to 44.9% for candidate selection in a standard recommender
system.

### [376] [Towards Unifying Quantitative Security Benchmarking for Multi Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21146)
*Gauri Sharma,Vidhi Kulkarni,Miles King,Ken Huang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型攻击向量——Agent Cascading Injection（ACI），描述了在多智能体系统中，局部漏洞如何通过信任链导致系统级故障，并呼吁建立定量评估框架以增强安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多智能体系统的普及，其安全性问题日益突出，尤其是信任链引发的级联风险。本文旨在定义并分析这种新型攻击，填补安全评估的空白。

Method: 通过形式化ACI攻击（包括攻击目标方程和关键变量），分析其传播链、放大因子等特性，并将其映射到OWASP的Agentic AI风险分类中。

Result: 论文提出了ACI攻击的详细模型，并开发了一种针对多智能体系统的压力测试方法，以评估其抗级联故障能力。

Conclusion: ACI攻击揭示了多智能体系统的安全挑战，呼吁建立标准化评估框架，为工程师提供数据驱动的安全优化工具。

Abstract: Evolving AI systems increasingly deploy multi-agent architectures where
autonomous agents collaborate, share information, and delegate tasks through
developing protocols. This connectivity, while powerful, introduces novel
security risks. One such risk is a cascading risk: a breach in one agent can
cascade through the system, compromising others by exploiting inter-agent
trust. In tandem with OWASP's initiative for an Agentic AI Vulnerability
Scoring System we define an attack vector, Agent Cascading Injection, analogous
to Agent Impact Chain and Blast Radius, operating across networks of agents. In
an ACI attack, a malicious input or tool exploit injected at one agent leads to
cascading compromises and amplified downstream effects across agents that trust
its outputs. We formalize this attack with an adversarial goal equation and key
variables (compromised agent, injected exploit, polluted observations, etc.),
capturing how a localized vulnerability can escalate into system-wide failure.
We then analyze ACI's properties -- propagation chains, amplification factors,
and inter-agent compound effects -- and map these to OWASP's emerging Agentic
AI risk categories (e.g. Impact Chain and Orchestration Exploits). Finally, we
argue that ACI highlights a critical need for quantitative benchmarking
frameworks to evaluate the security of agent-to-agent communication protocols.
We outline a methodology for stress-testing multi-agent systems (using
architectures such as Google's A2A and Anthropic's MCP) against cascading trust
failures, developing upon groundwork for measurable, standardized
agent-to-agent security evaluation. Our work provides the necessary apparatus
for engineers to benchmark system resilience, make data-driven architectural
trade-offs, and develop robust defenses against a new generation of agentic
threats.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为自降级防御（SDD）的框架，通过让大语言模型（LLM）对有害提示生成高质量但不相关的回答，从而在恶意微调时降低模型的通用能力，使其无法执行有害指令。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源大语言模型（LLM）常采用安全对齐方法抵御有害指令，但恶意微调可轻易绕过这些保护。本文旨在揭示恶意微调成功的原因并提出防御策略。

Method: 基于理论分析，提出自降级防御（SDD）框架，通过让LLM对有害提示生成不相关但高质量的回答，降低恶意微调时的模型能力。

Result: 实验证明SDD能有效抵御恶意微调攻击，显著降低模型的通用能力。

Conclusion: SDD为抵御恶意微调提供了一种有效策略，通过牺牲部分通用能力来确保安全性。

Abstract: Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) often employ safety alignment
methods to resist harmful instructions. However, recent research shows that
maliciously fine-tuning these LLMs on harmful data can easily bypass these
safeguards. To counter this, we theoretically uncover why malicious fine-tuning
succeeds and identify potential defense strategies. Building on the theoretical
analysis, we introduce the Self-Degraded Defense (SDD) framework. SDD
encourages LLMs to produce high-quality but irrelevant responses to harmful
prompts. When attackers attempt malicious fine-tuning, the general capability
of the LLM aligned by SDD will significantly decrease, rendering it incapable
of following harmful instructions. Our experimental results confirm SDD's
effectiveness against such attacks.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MaXsive是一种无需训练的扩散模型生成水印技术，具有高容量和鲁棒性，解决了现有方法对RST攻击的脆弱性和ID冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像合成中的成功引发了版权保护和不当内容生成的问题，现有训练免费水印方法对RST攻击脆弱且容量低。

Method: 利用初始噪声嵌入水印，并注入X形模板以恢复RST失真，避免使用重复环形图案。

Result: 在验证和识别场景下，MaXsive在两个知名水印基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: MaXsive显著提高了水印的鲁棒性和容量，减少了ID冲突的可能性。

Abstract: The great success of the diffusion model in image synthesis led to the
release of gigantic commercial models, raising the issue of copyright
protection and inappropriate content generation. Training-free diffusion
watermarking provides a low-cost solution for these issues. However, the prior
works remain vulnerable to rotation, scaling, and translation (RST) attacks.
Although some methods employ meticulously designed patterns to mitigate this
issue, they often reduce watermark capacity, which can result in identity (ID)
collusion. To address these problems, we propose MaXsive, a training-free
diffusion model generative watermarking technique that has high capacity and
robustness. MaXsive best utilizes the initial noise to watermark the diffusion
model. Moreover, instead of using a meticulously repetitive ring pattern, we
propose injecting the X-shape template to recover the RST distortions. This
design significantly increases robustness without losing any capacity, making
ID collusion less likely to happen. The effectiveness of MaXsive has been
verified on two well-known watermarking benchmarks under the scenarios of
verification and identification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络易受对抗样本攻击，但缺乏对其鲁棒性和输入稳定性的评估方法。

Method: 通过监控特定神经元输出的变化，提出NCCR指标来衡量模型鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明NCCR能有效评估神经网络及其输入的鲁棒性，并检测对抗样本。

Conclusion: NCCR为评估神经网络鲁棒性和对抗样本检测提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Neural networks have received a lot of attention recently, and related
security issues have come with it. Many studies have shown that neural networks
are vulnerable to adversarial examples that have been artificially perturbed
with modification, which is too small to be distinguishable by human
perception. Different attacks and defenses have been proposed to solve these
problems, but there is little research on evaluating the robustness of neural
networks and their inputs. In this work, we propose a metric called the neuron
cover change rate (NCCR) to measure the ability of deep learning models to
resist attacks and the stability of adversarial examples. NCCR monitors
alterations in the output of specifically chosen neurons when the input is
perturbed, and networks with a smaller degree of variation are considered to be
more robust. The results of the experiment on image recognition and the speaker
recognition model show that our metrics can provide a good assessment of the
robustness of neural networks or their inputs. It can also be used to detect
whether an input is adversarial or not, as adversarial examples are always less
robust.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的隐写分析方法存在计算复杂和泛化能力不足的问题，GNN能利用关系数据提升性能。

Method: 从VoIP流构建简单图，使用GraphSAGE捕捉多层级隐写信息，包括细节和全局模式。

Result: 实验显示，该方法对QIM隐写模式的检测准确率超过98%（0.5秒样本），低嵌入率下仍达95.17%，效率提升0.003秒。

Conclusion: 该方法在短样本低嵌入率条件下，实现了检测精度与效率的优越平衡，适用于在线隐写分析。

Abstract: Steganalysis methods based on deep learning (DL) often struggle with
computational complexity and challenges in generalizing across different
datasets. Incorporating a graph neural network (GNN) into steganalysis schemes
enables the leveraging of relational data for improved detection accuracy and
adaptability. This paper presents the first application of a Graph Neural
Network (GNN), specifically the GraphSAGE architecture, for steganalysis of
compressed voice over IP (VoIP) speech streams. The method involves
straightforward graph construction from VoIP streams and employs GraphSAGE to
capture hierarchical steganalysis information, including both fine grained
details and high level patterns, thereby achieving high detection accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate that the developed approach performs well in
uncovering quantization index modulation (QIM)-based steganographic patterns in
VoIP signals. It achieves detection accuracy exceeding 98 percent even for
short 0.5 second samples, and 95.17 percent accuracy under challenging
conditions with low embedding rates, representing an improvement of 2.8 percent
over the best performing state of the art methods. Furthermore, the model
exhibits superior efficiency, with an average detection time as low as 0.016
seconds for 0.5-second samples an improvement of 0.003 seconds. This makes it
efficient for online steganalysis tasks, providing a superior balance between
detection accuracy and efficiency under the constraint of short samples with
low embedding rates.

TL;DR: GUARD-CAN是一种结合图表示学习和时间序列建模的异常检测框架，用于保护车载网络中的CAN总线安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代车载网络由于CAN总线缺乏加密和认证，面临多种网络威胁。

Method: GUARD-CAN将CAN消息分窗并转换为图，利用过完备自编码器和图卷积网络生成图嵌入向量，再通过GRU检测时间异常模式。

Result: GUARD-CAN能有效检测四种CAN攻击（洪泛、模糊、重放和欺骗攻击），无需复杂特征工程。

Conclusion: GUARD-CAN通过多视角性能评估和窗口大小分析，展示了其在CAN安全中的有效性。

Abstract: Modern in-vehicle networks face various cyber threats due to the lack of
encryption and authentication in the Controller Area Network (CAN). To address
this security issue, this paper presents GUARD-CAN, an anomaly detection
framework that combines graph-based representation learning with time-series
modeling. GUARD-CAN splits CAN messages into fixed-length windows and converts
each window into a graph that preserves message order. To detect anomalies in
the timeaware and structure-aware context at the same window, GUARD-CAN takes
advantage of the overcomplete Autoencoder (AE) and Graph Convolutional Network
(GCN) to generate graph embedding vectors. The model groups these vectors into
sequences and feeds them into the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to detect temporal
anomaly patterns across the graphs. GUARD-CAN performs anomaly detection at
both the sequence level and the window level, and this allows multi-perspective
performance evaluation. The model also verifies the importance of window size
selection through an analysis based on Shannon entropy. As a result, GUARD-CAN
shows that the proposed model detects four types of CAN attacks (flooding,
fuzzing, replay and spoofing attacks) effectively without relying on complex
feature engineering.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SecTOW是一种创新的防御-攻击迭代训练方法，通过强化学习提升多模态大语言模型的安全性，同时保持通用性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型的安全性问题突出，现有防御方法无法解决其内在漏洞，且传统监督微调容易过度拒绝无害输入。

Method: SecTOW包含防御者和辅助攻击者两个模块，通过迭代训练和强化学习（GRPO）扩展越狱数据并优化防御。

Result: 实验表明，SecTOW显著提升了模型的安全性，同时未损害通用性能。

Conclusion: SecTOW为解决多模态大语言模型的安全问题提供了一种高效且平衡的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has led to
breakthroughs in various applications, yet their security remains a critical
challenge. One pressing issue involves unsafe image-query pairs--jailbreak
inputs specifically designed to bypass security constraints and elicit
unintended responses from MLLMs. Compared to general multimodal data, such
unsafe inputs are relatively sparse, which limits the diversity and richness of
training samples available for developing robust defense models. Meanwhile,
existing guardrail-type methods rely on external modules to enforce security
constraints but fail to address intrinsic vulnerabilities within MLLMs.
Traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), on the other hand, often over-refuses
harmless inputs, compromising general performance. Given these challenges, we
propose Secure Tug-of-War (SecTOW), an innovative iterative defense-attack
training method to enhance the security of MLLMs. SecTOW consists of two
modules: a defender and an auxiliary attacker, both trained iteratively using
reinforcement learning (GRPO). During the iterative process, the attacker
identifies security vulnerabilities in the defense model and expands jailbreak
data. The expanded data are then used to train the defender, enabling it to
address identified security vulnerabilities. We also design reward mechanisms
used for GRPO to simplify the use of response labels, reducing dependence on
complex generative labels and enabling the efficient use of synthetic data.
Additionally, a quality monitoring mechanism is used to mitigate the defender's
over-refusal of harmless inputs and ensure the diversity of the jailbreak data
generated by the attacker. Experimental results on safety-specific and general
benchmarks demonstrate that SecTOW significantly improves security while
preserving general performance.

Conclusion: 流体神经化技术为机器人触觉感知提供了一种简单、适应性强且耐用的解决方案，为多功能机器人操作开辟了新机会。

Abstract: Tactile sensing plays a fundamental role in enabling robots to navigate
dynamic and unstructured environments, particularly in applications such as
delicate object manipulation, surface exploration, and human-robot interaction.
In this paper, we introduce a passive soft robotic fingertip with integrated
tactile sensing, fabricated using a 3D-printed elastomer lattice with embedded
air channels. This sensorization approach, termed fluidic innervation,
transforms the lattice into a tactile sensor by detecting pressure changes
within sealed air channels, providing a simple yet robust solution to tactile
sensing in robotics. Unlike conventional methods that rely on complex materials
or designs, fluidic innervation offers a simple, scalable, single-material
fabrication process. We characterize the sensors' response, develop a geometric
model to estimate tip displacement, and train a neural network to accurately
predict contact location and contact force. Additionally, we integrate the
fingertip with an admittance controller to emulate spring-like behavior,
demonstrate its capability for environment exploration through tactile
feedback, and validate its durability under high impact and cyclic loading
conditions. This tactile sensing technique offers advantages in terms of
simplicity, adaptability, and durability and opens up new opportunities for
versatile robotic manipulation.

Result: 实验显示，该方法比模型驱动方法精度提高26%，比学习驱动方法提高15%。

Conclusion: 该方法为低成本陀螺仪在自主平台中的导航提供了更准确和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: An accurate initial heading angle is essential for efficient and safe
navigation across diverse domains. Unlike magnetometers, gyroscopes can provide
accurate heading reference independent of the magnetic disturbances in a
process known as gyrocompassing. Yet, accurate and timely gyrocompassing, using
low-cost gyroscopes, remains a significant challenge in scenarios where
external navigation aids are unavailable. Such challenges are commonly
addressed in real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles, where size,
weight, and power limitations restrict sensor quality, and noisy measurements
severely degrade gyrocompassing performance. To cope with this challenge, we
propose a novel diffusion denoiser-aided gyrocompass approach. It integrates a
diffusion-based denoising framework with an enhanced learning-based heading
estimation model. The diffusion denoiser processes raw inertial sensor signals
before input to the deep learning model, resulting in accurate gyrocompassing.
Experiments using both simulated and real sensor data demonstrate that our
proposed approach improves gyrocompassing accuracy by 26% compared to
model-based gyrocompassing and by 15% compared to other learning-driven
approaches. This advancement holds particular significance for ensuring
accurate and robust navigation in autonomous platforms that incorporate
low-cost gyroscopes within their navigation systems.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology,
vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication has emerged as a key enabler for
extending perception range and enhancing driving safety by providing visibility
beyond the line of sight. However, integrating multi-source sensor data from
both ego-vehicles and infrastructure under real-world constraints, such as
limited communication bandwidth and dynamic environments, presents significant
technical challenges. To facilitate research in this area, we organized the
End-to-End Autonomous Driving through V2X Cooperation Challenge, which features
two tracks: cooperative temporal perception and cooperative end-to-end

challenge attracted participation from over 30 teams worldwide and established
a unified benchmark for evaluating cooperative driving systems. This paper
describes the design and outcomes of the challenge, highlights key research
problems including bandwidth-aware fusion, robust multi-agent planning, and
heterogeneous sensor integration, and analyzes emerging technical trends among
top-performing solutions. By addressing practical constraints in communication
and data fusion, the challenge contributes to the development of scalable and

Result: 系统表现出多稳态特性，并存在未训练的吸引子，反映了机器人及其环境的固有特性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为理解具身认知的未探索特性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that the dynamics of physical systems can be
utilized for the desired information processing under the framework of physical
reservoir computing (PRC). Robots with soft bodies are examples of such
physical systems, and their nonlinear body-environment dynamics can be used to
compute and generate the motor signals necessary for the control of their own
behavior. In this simulation study, we extend this approach to control and
embed not only one but also multiple behaviors into a type of soft robot called
a tensegrity robot. The resulting system, consisting of the robot and the
environment, is a multistable dynamical system that converges to different
attractors from varying initial conditions. Furthermore, attractor analysis
reveals that there exist "untrained attractors" in the state space of the
system outside the training data. These untrained attractors reflect the
intrinsic properties and structures of the tensegrity robot and its
interactions with the environment. The impacts of these recent findings in PRC
remain unexplored in embodied AI research. We here illustrate their potential
to understand various features of embodied cognition that have not been fully
addressed to date.

Method: 使用决策变换器框架，以RTG作为温度参数动态调整安全与效率的权衡。

Result: 仿真和实际实验表明，该规划器通过RTG调参优于基线方法，生成更安全或更高效的轨迹。

Conclusion: 提出的规划器通过RTG参数实现了动态权衡调整，具有实用性和可靠性。

Abstract: A drone trajectory planner should be able to dynamically adjust the
safety-efficiency trade-off according to varying mission requirements in
unknown environments. Although traditional polynomial-based planners offer
computational efficiency and smooth trajectory generation, they require expert
knowledge to tune multiple parameters to adjust this trade-off. Moreover, even
with careful tuning, the resulting adjustment may fail to achieve the desired
trade-off. Similarly, although reinforcement learning-based planners are
adaptable in unknown environments, they do not explicitly address the
safety-efficiency trade-off. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
Decision Transformer-based trajectory planner that leverages a single
parameter, Return-to-Go (RTG), as a \emph{temperature parameter} to dynamically
adjust the safety-efficiency trade-off. In our framework, since RTG intuitively
measures the safety and efficiency of a trajectory, RTG tuning does not require
expert knowledge. We validate our approach using Gazebo simulations in both
structured grid and unstructured random environments. The experimental results
demonstrate that our planner can dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency
trade-off by simply tuning the RTG parameter. Furthermore, our planner
outperforms existing baseline methods across various RTG settings, generating
safer trajectories when tuned for safety and more efficient trajectories when
tuned for efficiency. Real-world experiments further confirm the reliability
and practicality of our proposed planner.

Abstract: Human demonstration data is often ambiguous and incomplete, motivating
imitation learning approaches that also exhibit reliable planning behavior. A
common paradigm to perform planning-from-demonstration involves learning a
reward function via Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) then deploying this
reward via Model Predictive Control (MPC). Towards unifying these methods, we
derive a replacement of the policy in IRL with a planning-based agent. With
connections to Adversarial Imitation Learning, this formulation enables
end-to-end interactive learning of planners from observation-only
demonstrations. In addition to benefits in interpretability, complexity, and
safety, we study and observe significant improvements on sample efficiency,
out-of-distribution generalization, and robustness. The study includes
evaluations in both simulated control benchmarks and real-world navigation
experiments using few-to-single observation-only demonstrations.

Abstract: Mobile manipulation is a critical capability for robots operating in diverse,
real-world environments. However, manipulating deformable objects and materials
remains a major challenge for existing robot learning algorithms. While various
benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate manipulation strategies with rigid
objects, there is still a notable lack of standardized benchmarks that address
mobile manipulation tasks involving deformable objects.
  To address this gap, we introduce MoDeSuite, the first Mobile Manipulation
Deformable Object task suite, designed specifically for robot learning.
MoDeSuite consists of eight distinct mobile manipulation tasks covering both
elastic objects and deformable objects, each presenting a unique challenge
inspired by real-world robot applications. Success in these tasks requires
effective collaboration between the robot's base and manipulator, as well as
the ability to exploit the deformability of the objects. To evaluate and
demonstrate the use of the proposed benchmark, we train two state-of-the-art
reinforcement learning algorithms and two imitation learning algorithms,
highlighting the difficulties encountered and showing their performance in
simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical relevance of the suite by
deploying the trained policies directly into the real world with the Spot
robot, showcasing the potential for sim-to-real transfer. We expect that
MoDeSuite will open a novel research domain in mobile manipulation involving
deformable objects. Find more details, code, and videos at

Conclusion: RAG与LLMs的结合在智能信息检索和非结构化技术文本解释中具有显著优势。

Abstract: The production of digital documents has been growing rapidly in academic,
business, and health environments, presenting new challenges in the efficient
extraction and analysis of unstructured information. This work investigates the
use of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architectures combined with
Large-Scale Language Models (LLMs) to automate the analysis of documents in PDF
format. The proposal integrates vector search techniques by embeddings,
semantic data extraction and generation of contextualized natural language
responses. To validate the approach, we conducted experiments with drug package
inserts extracted from official public sources. The semantic queries applied
were evaluated by metrics such as accuracy, completeness, response speed and
consistency. The results indicate that the combination of RAG with LLMs offers
significant gains in intelligent information retrieval and interpretation of
unstructured technical texts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多代理系统在通信、协调和异构工具交互方面存在挑战，缺乏整合A2A和MCP协议的应用。

Method: 提出AgentMaster框架，实现A2A和MCP协议，支持自然语言交互和多模态查询。

Result: 评估显示BERTScore F1和G-Eval分别达到96.3%和87.1%，证明其协调和响应能力。

Conclusion: 该框架为领域特定、可扩展的对话AI提供了潜力。

Abstract: The rise of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) in Artificial Intelligence (AI),
especially integrated with Large Language Models (LLMs), has greatly
facilitated the resolution of complex tasks. However, current systems are still
facing challenges of inter-agent communication, coordination, and interaction
with heterogeneous tools and resources. Most recently, the Model Context
Protocol (MCP) by Anthropic and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocol by
Google have been introduced, and to the best of our knowledge, very few
applications exist where both protocols are employed within a single MAS
framework. We present a pilot study of AgentMaster, a novel modular
multi-protocol MAS framework with self-implemented A2A and MCP, enabling
dynamic coordination and flexible communication. Through a unified
conversational interface, the system supports natural language interaction
without prior technical expertise and responds to multimodal queries for tasks
including information retrieval, question answering, and image analysis.
Evaluation through the BERTScore F1 and LLM-as-a-Judge metric G-Eval averaged
96.3\% and 87.1\%, revealing robust inter-agent coordination, query
decomposition, dynamic routing, and domain-specific, relevant responses.
Overall, our proposed framework contributes to the potential capabilities of
domain-specific, cooperative, and scalable conversational AI powered by MAS.

TL;DR: FedFlex是一种联邦推荐系统，通过结合矩阵分解算法和MMR重新排序，提升推荐的多样性和公平性，实验证明其在不影响用户满意度的情况下引入多样性内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦推荐系统主要关注准确性，而忽视了公平性和多样性，FedFlex旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 结合SVD和BPR矩阵分解算法进行个性化微调，并应用MMR重新排序以增强多样性。

Result: 实验和用户研究表明，FedFlex成功引入多样性内容（如新类型）且未显著影响用户满意度。

Conclusion: FedFlex为联邦推荐系统提供了一种平衡准确性和多样性的有效方法。

Abstract: Federated learning is a decentralized approach that enables collaborative
model training across multiple devices while preserving data privacy. It has
shown significant potential in various domains, including healthcare and
personalized recommendation systems. However, most existing work on federated
recommendation systems has focused primarily on improving accuracy, with
limited attention to fairness and diversity. In this paper, we introduce
FedFlex, a federated recommender system for Netflix-style TV series
recommendations. FedFlex integrates two state-of-the-art matrix factorization
algorithms for personalized fine-tuning. FedFlex also applies Maximal Marginal
Relevance (MMR) to re-rank items and enhance diversity. We conduct extensive
experiments comparing recommendations generated by SVD and BPR algorithms. In a
live two-week user study, participants received two recommendation lists: List
A, based on SVD or BPR, and List B, a re-ranked version emphasizing diversity.
Participants were asked to click on the movies they were interested in
watching. Our findings demonstrate that FedFlex effectively introduces diverse
content, such as new genres, into recommendations without necessarily
compromising user satisfaction.

Abstract: In an era of radical technology transformations, technology maps play a
crucial role in enhancing decision making. These maps heavily rely on automated
methods of technology extraction. This paper introduces Retrieval Augmented
Technology Extraction (RATE), a Large Language Model (LLM) based pipeline for
automated technology extraction from scientific literature. RATE combines
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with multi-definition LLM-based
validation. This hybrid method results in high recall in candidate generation
alongside with high precision in candidate filtering. While the pipeline is
designed to be general and widely applicable, we demonstrate its use on 678
research articles focused on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and Extended
Reality (XR) as a case study. Consequently, The validated technology terms by
RATE were mapped into a co-occurrence network, revealing thematic clusters and
structural features of the research landscape. For the purpose of evaluation, a
gold standard dataset of technologies in 70 selected random articles had been
curated by the experts. In addition, a technology extraction model based on
Bidirectional Encoder Representations of Transformers (BERT) was used as a
comparative method. RATE achieved F1-score of 91.27%, Significantly
outperforming BERT with F1-score of 53.73%. Our findings highlight the promise
of definition-driven LLM methods for technology extraction and mapping. They
also offer new insights into emerging trends within the BCI-XR field. The

Abstract: Recommender systems have traditionally followed modular architectures
comprising candidate generation, multi-stage ranking, and re-ranking, each
trained separately with supervised objectives and hand-engineered features.
While effective in many domains, such systems face persistent challenges
including sparse and noisy interaction data, cold-start problems, limited
personalization depth, and inadequate semantic understanding of user and item
content. The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a new
paradigm for addressing these limitations through unified, language-native
mechanisms that can generalize across tasks, domains, and modalities. In this
paper, we present a comprehensive technical survey of how LLMs can be leveraged
to tackle key challenges in modern recommender systems. We examine the use of
LLMs for prompt-driven candidate retrieval, language-native ranking,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and conversational recommendation,
illustrating how these approaches enhance personalization, semantic alignment,
and interpretability without requiring extensive task-specific supervision.
LLMs further enable zero- and few-shot reasoning, allowing systems to operate
effectively in cold-start and long-tail scenarios by leveraging external
knowledge and contextual cues. We categorize these emerging LLM-driven
architectures and analyze their effectiveness in mitigating core bottlenecks of
conventional pipelines. In doing so, we provide a structured framework for
understanding the design space of LLM-enhanced recommenders, and outline the
trade-offs between accuracy, scalability, and real-time performance. Our goal
is to demonstrate that LLMs are not merely auxiliary components but
foundational enablers for building more adaptive, semantically rich, and
user-centric recommender systems

Conclusion: 跨域推荐方法在艺术治疗中具有潜力，音乐驱动的偏好获取能显著提升个性化推荐效果。

Abstract: Art Therapy (AT) is an established practice that facilitates emotional
processing and recovery through creative expression. Recently, Visual Art
Recommender Systems (VA RecSys) have emerged to support AT, demonstrating their
potential by personalizing therapeutic artwork recommendations. Nonetheless,
current VA RecSys rely on visual stimuli for user modeling, limiting their
ability to capture the full spectrum of emotional responses during preference
elicitation. Previous studies have shown that music stimuli elicit unique
affective reflections, presenting an opportunity for cross-domain
recommendation (CDR) to enhance personalization in AT. Since CDR has not yet
been explored in this context, we propose a family of CDR methods for AT based
on music-driven preference elicitation. A large-scale study with 200 users
demonstrates the efficacy of music-driven preference elicitation, outperforming
the classic visual-only elicitation approach. Our source code, data, and models
are available at https://github.com/ArtAICare/Affect-aware-CDR

Conclusion: 通过数据增强和图对比学习，有效缓解了数据稀疏性和流行度偏差问题。

Abstract: Recommendation systems often suffer from data sparsity caused by limited
user-item interactions, which degrade their performance and amplify popularity
bias in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel data augmentation
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and item textual
descriptions to enrich interaction data. By few-shot prompting LLMs multiple
times to rerank items and aggregating the results via majority voting, we
generate high-confidence synthetic user-item interactions, supported by
theoretical guarantees based on the concentration of measure. To effectively
leverage the augmented data in the context of a graph recommendation system, we
integrate it into a graph contrastive learning framework to mitigate
distributional shift and alleviate popularity bias. Extensive experiments show
that our method improves accuracy and reduces popularity bias, outperforming
strong baselines.

Abstract: The importance of recommender systems on the web has grown, especially in the
movie industry, with a vast selection of options to watch. To assist users in
traversing available items and finding relevant results, recommender systems
analyze operational data and investigate users' tastes and habits. Providing
highly individualized suggestions can boost user engagement and satisfaction,
which is one of the fundamental goals of the movie industry, significantly in
online platforms. According to recent studies and research, using
knowledge-based techniques and considering the semantic ideas of the textual
data is a suitable way to get more appropriate results. This study provides a
new method for building a knowledge graph based on semantic information. It
uses the ChatGPT, as a large language model, to assess the brief descriptions
of movies and extract their tone of voice. Results indicated that using the
proposed method may significantly enhance accuracy rather than employing the
explicit genres supplied by the publishers.
