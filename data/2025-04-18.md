### [1] [Unmasking the Reality of PII Masking Models: Performance Gaps and the Call for Accountability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12308)
*Devansh Singh,Sundaraparipurnan Narayanan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了隐私掩码技术在数据隐私中的重要性，分析了基于NER的PII检测模型的局限性，并通过实验展示了这些模型在实际应用中的隐私暴露风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于揭示现有PII检测模型在数据集和NER方法上的局限性，以及这些模型在实际应用中对隐私的潜在威胁。

Method: 方法包括构建一个包含16种PII类型的17K半合成句子数据集，并在五个NER检测维度及对抗性上下文中评估模型性能。

Result: 结果显示，尽管模型被广泛下载使用，但其在PII检测和掩码方面存在显著缺陷，导致隐私暴露风险。

Conclusion: 结论强调需要改进模型性能评估方法，并在模型卡片中提供更全面的上下文披露。

Abstract: Privacy Masking is a critical concept under data privacy involving
anonymization and de-anonymization of personally identifiable information
(PII). Privacy masking techniques rely on Named Entity Recognition (NER)
approaches under NLP support in identifying and classifying named entities in
each text. NER approaches, however, have several limitations including (a)
content sensitivity including ambiguous, polysemic, context dependent or domain
specific content, (b) phrasing variabilities including nicknames and alias,
informal expressions, alternative representations, emerging expressions,
evolving naming conventions and (c) formats or syntax variations, typos,
misspellings. However, there are a couple of PII datasets that have been widely
used by researchers and the open-source community to train models on PII
detection or masking. These datasets have been used to train models including
Piiranha and Starpii, which have been downloaded over 300k and 580k times on
HuggingFace. We examine the quality of the PII masking by these models given
the limitations of the datasets and of the NER approaches. We curate a dataset
of 17K unique, semi-synthetic sentences containing 16 types of PII by compiling
information from across multiple jurisdictions including India, U.K and U.S. We
generate sentences (using language models) containing these PII at five
different NER detection feature dimensions - (1) Basic Entity Recognition, (2)
Contextual Entity Disambiguation, (3) NER in Noisy & Real-World Data, (4)
Evolving & Novel Entities Detection and (5) Cross-Lingual or multi-lingual NER)
and 1 in adversarial context. We present the results and exhibit the privacy
exposure caused by such model use (considering the extent of lifetime downloads
of these models). We conclude by highlighting the gaps in measuring performance
of the models and the need for contextual disclosure in model cards for such
models.

### [2] [Learning Optimal Prompt Ensemble for Multi-source Visual Prompt Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12311)
*Enming Zhang,Liwen Cao,Yanru Wu,Zijie Zhao,Guan Wang,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HGPrompt是一种自适应框架，通过优化可迁移性和稳定性目标，解决多源提示聚合中的表示崩溃问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练提示作为重要资产，多源提示聚合可提升新任务的泛化能力，但直接聚合易导致表示崩溃。

Method: 提出HGPrompt框架，结合信息论度量评估提示特征的可迁移性，并引入梯度对齐正则化抑制干扰。

Result: 在大规模VTAB基准测试中，HGPrompt实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: HGPrompt有效解决了多源提示迁移中的干扰问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Prompt tuning has emerged as a lightweight adaptation strategy for adapting
foundation models to downstream tasks, particularly in resource-constrained
systems. As pre-trained prompts have become valuable intellectual assets,
combining multiple source prompts offers a promising approach to enhance
generalization to new tasks by leveraging complementary knowledge from diverse
sources. However, naive aggregation of these prompts often leads to
representation collapse due to mutual interference, undermining their
collective potential. To address these challenges, we propose HGPrompt, an
adaptive framework for multi-source prompt transfer that learns optimal
ensemble weights by jointly optimizing dual objectives: transferability and
stability. Specifically, we first introduce an information-theoretic metric to
evaluate the transferability of prompt-induced features on the target task,
capturing the intrinsic alignment between the feature representations.
Additionally, we propose a novel Gradient Alignment Regularization to mitigate
gradient conflicts among prompts, enabling stable and coherent knowledge
transfer from multiple sources while suppressing interference. Extensive
experiments on the large-scale VTAB benchmark demonstrate that HGPrompt
achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness in
multi-source prompt transfer.

### [3] [Socrates or Smartypants: Testing Logic Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models with Logic Programming-based Test Oracles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12312)
*Zihao Xu,Junchen Ding,Yiling Lou,Kun Zhang,Dong Gong,Yuekang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SmartyPat-Bench是一个基于真实Reddit帖子的逻辑谬误基准测试，通过自动化框架SmartyPat生成高质量的逻辑谬误数据，用于评估大语言模型的逻辑推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有逻辑推理数据集过于简单或不自然，无法满足对大语言模型逻辑推理能力评估的需求。

Method: 提出SmartyPat-Bench基准测试和SmartyPat自动化框架，利用Prolog规则生成逻辑谬误，并通过LLM优化为自然语言句子。

Result: SmartyPat生成的谬误与人工生成内容质量相当，且在实验中揭示了LLM在谬误检测和分类中的表现。

Conclusion: SmartyPat-Bench和SmartyPat为逻辑推理评估提供了高质量数据，并揭示了LLM在复杂推理任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress in language
understanding and reasoning. Evaluating and analyzing their logical reasoning
abilities has therefore become essential. However, existing datasets and
benchmarks are often limited to overly simplistic, unnatural, or contextually
constrained examples. In response to the growing demand, we introduce
SmartyPat-Bench, a challenging, naturally expressed, and systematically labeled
benchmark derived from real-world high-quality Reddit posts containing subtle
logical fallacies. Unlike existing datasets and benchmarks, it provides more
detailed annotations of logical fallacies and features more diverse data. To
further scale up the study and address the limitations of manual data
collection and labeling - such as fallacy-type imbalance and labor-intensive
annotation - we introduce SmartyPat, an automated framework powered by logic
programming-based oracles. SmartyPat utilizes Prolog rules to systematically
generate logically fallacious statements, which are then refined into fluent
natural-language sentences by LLMs, ensuring precise fallacy representation.
Extensive evaluation demonstrates that SmartyPat produces fallacies comparable
in subtlety and quality to human-generated content and significantly
outperforms baseline methods. Finally, experiments reveal nuanced insights into
LLM capabilities, highlighting that while excessive reasoning steps hinder
fallacy detection accuracy, structured reasoning enhances fallacy
categorization performance.

### [4] [Exploring the Impact of Personality Traits on Conversational Recommender Systems: A Simulation with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12313)
*Xiaoyan Zhao,Yang Deng,Wenjie Wang,Hongzhan lin,Hong Cheng,Rui Zhang,See-Kiong Ng,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的个性化感知用户模拟系统（PerCRS），用于研究人格特质如何影响对话式推荐系统的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人格特质对用户交互行为有显著影响，但现有对话式推荐系统（CRS）缺乏对此的深入理解。

Method: 引入PerCRS，用户代理模拟个性化特质和偏好，系统代理具备说服能力以模拟真实交互。采用多角度评估确保鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，LLM能生成符合特定人格特质的多样化用户响应，促使CRS动态调整推荐策略。

Conclusion: 研究为理解人格特质对对话推荐结果的影响提供了实证支持。

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) engage users in multi-turn
interactions to deliver personalized recommendations. The emergence of large
language models (LLMs) further enhances these systems by enabling more natural
and dynamic user interactions. However, a key challenge remains in
understanding how personality traits shape conversational recommendation
outcomes. Psychological evidence highlights the influence of personality traits
on user interaction behaviors. To address this, we introduce an LLM-based
personality-aware user simulation for CRSs (PerCRS). The user agent induces
customizable personality traits and preferences, while the system agent
possesses the persuasion capability to simulate realistic interaction in CRSs.
We incorporate multi-aspect evaluation to ensure robustness and conduct
extensive analysis from both user and system perspectives. Experimental results
demonstrate that state-of-the-art LLMs can effectively generate diverse user
responses aligned with specified personality traits, thereby prompting CRSs to
dynamically adjust their recommendation strategies. Our experimental analysis
offers empirical insights into the impact of personality traits on the outcomes
of conversational recommender systems.

### [5] [How to Detect and Defeat Molecular Mirage: A Metric-Driven Benchmark for Hallucination in LLM-based Molecular Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12314)
*Hao Li,Liuzhenghao Lv,He Cao,Zijing Liu,Zhiyuan Yan,Yu Wang,Yonghong Tian,Yu Li,Li Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了LLMs在分子理解任务中的幻觉问题，提出了Mol-Hallu评估指标和HRPP后处理方法以减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在分子理解任务中存在幻觉问题，影响药物设计和使用的准确性。

Method: 提出Mol-Hallu评估指标量化幻觉程度，并设计HRPP后处理方法减少幻觉。

Result: 实验验证HRPP在多种分子LLMs中的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究为减少LLMs在科学应用中的幻觉提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used in scientific domains, especially
for molecular understanding and analysis. However, existing models are affected
by hallucination issues, resulting in errors in drug design and utilization. In
this paper, we first analyze the sources of hallucination in LLMs for molecular
comprehension tasks, specifically the knowledge shortcut phenomenon observed in
the PubChem dataset. To evaluate hallucination in molecular comprehension tasks
with computational efficiency, we introduce \textbf{Mol-Hallu}, a novel
free-form evaluation metric that quantifies the degree of hallucination based
on the scientific entailment relationship between generated text and actual
molecular properties. Utilizing the Mol-Hallu metric, we reassess and analyze
the extent of hallucination in various LLMs performing molecular comprehension
tasks. Furthermore, the Hallucination Reduction Post-processing stage~(HRPP) is
proposed to alleviate molecular hallucinations, Experiments show the
effectiveness of HRPP on decoder-only and encoder-decoder molecular LLMs. Our
findings provide critical insights into mitigating hallucination and improving
the reliability of LLMs in scientific applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Capybara-OMNI是一种轻量高效的多模态大语言模型（MLLM），支持文本、图像、视频和音频模态。论文详细介绍了其框架设计、数据构建和训练方法，并通过实验验证了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建强大的MLLM通常计算和时间成本高昂，因此需要一种轻量高效的训练方法。

Method: 提出了Capybara-OMNI，详细描述了其框架设计、数据构建和训练方法，并提供了专属基准测试。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能高效构建性能优异的MLLM，并在多模态基准测试中表现竞争力。

Conclusion: Capybara-OMNI及其聊天版本公开可用，为多模态任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: With the development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), numerous
outstanding accomplishments have emerged within the open-source community. Due
to the complexity of creating and training multimodal data pairs, it is still a
computational and time-consuming process to build powerful MLLMs. In this work,
we introduce Capybara-OMNI, an MLLM that trains in a lightweight and efficient
manner and supports understanding text, image, video, and audio modalities. We
present in detail the framework design, the data construction, and the training
recipe, to develop an MLLM step-by-step to obtain competitive performance. We
also provide exclusive benchmarks utilized in our experiments to show how to
properly verify understanding capabilities across different modalities. Results
show that by following our guidance, we can efficiently build an MLLM that
achieves competitive performance among models of the same scale on various
multimodal benchmarks. Additionally, to enhance the multimodal instruction
following and conversational capabilities of the model, we further discuss how
to train the chat version upon an MLLM understanding model, which is more in
line with user habits for tasks like real-time interaction with humans. We
publicly disclose the Capybara-OMNI model, along with its chat-based version.
The disclosure includes both the model weights, a portion of the training data,
and the inference codes, which are made available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为“数据代谢”的数据中心框架，用于构建视觉语言模型（VLM），并通过闭环系统持续优化模型性能。发布的Capybara-VL模型在多项任务中表现优异，甚至超越了一些规模更大的开源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据管理在训练强大的视觉语言模型中至关重要，但现有方法缺乏系统化的数据迭代机制。本文旨在通过数据代谢框架解决这一问题。

Method: 提出数据代谢概念，构建数据中心框架，包括数据管理和迭代两个关键步骤，形成闭环系统。详细介绍了如何处理大规模数据集并构建用户特定的数据飞轮。

Result: 发布的Capybara-VL模型在多项任务中表现优异，超越了一些规模更大的开源模型，并与部分领先的专有模型性能相当。

Conclusion: 数据中心框架和Capybara-VL的成功展示了训练更小、更高效视觉语言模型的潜力。

Abstract: Data curation plays a crucial role in training powerful Visual Language
Models (VLMs). In this work, we introduce the concept of Data Metabolism and
present our data-centric framework to build VLMs throughout the development
lifecycle. Starting from a standard model architecture, we discuss and provide
insights into two crucial development steps: data curation and iteration,
forming a closed-loop system that continuously improves model performance. We
show a detailed codebook on how to process existing massive datasets and build
user-specific data flywheel. As a demonstration, we release a VLM, named
Capybara-VL, which excels in typical multimodal tasks (e.g. , visual question
answering, scientific reasoning, and text-rich tasks). Despite its relatively
compact size, Capybara-VL surpasses several open-source models that are up to
10 times larger in size. Moreover, it achieves results that are on par with
those of several leading proprietary models, demonstrating its remarkable
competitiveness. These results highlight the power of our data-centric
framework and the potential of training smaller and more efficient VLMs.

### [8] [ChatGPT as Linguistic Equalizer? Quantifying LLM-Driven Lexical Shifts in Academic Writing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12317)
*Dingkang Lin,Naixuan Zhao,Dan Tian,Jiang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChatGPT显著提升了非英语母语学者（NNES）在学术写作中的词汇复杂性，减少了语言障碍，促进了学术公平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ChatGPT是否能够减轻非英语母语学者在学术写作中的语言障碍，并促进学术公平。

Method: 使用MTLD量化词汇复杂性，并通过双重差分法（DID）分析2.8百万篇OpenAlex文章（2020-2024）的词汇变化。

Result: ChatGPT显著提高了NNES作者摘要的词汇复杂性，尤其在预印本、技术和生物领域及低级别期刊中效果最明显。

Conclusion: ChatGPT减少了语言差异，促进了全球学术界的公平性。

Abstract: The advent of ChatGPT has profoundly reshaped scientific research practices,
particularly in academic writing, where non-native English-speakers (NNES)
historically face linguistic barriers. This study investigates whether ChatGPT
mitigates these barriers and fosters equity by analyzing lexical complexity
shifts across 2.8 million articles from OpenAlex (2020-2024). Using the Measure
of Textual Lexical Diversity (MTLD) to quantify vocabulary sophistication and a
difference-in-differences (DID) design to identify causal effects, we
demonstrate that ChatGPT significantly enhances lexical complexity in
NNES-authored abstracts, even after controlling for article-level controls,
authorship patterns, and venue norms. Notably, the impact is most pronounced in
preprint papers, technology- and biology-related fields and lower-tier
journals. These findings provide causal evidence that ChatGPT reduces
linguistic disparities and promotes equity in global academia.

### [9] [Has the Creativity of Large-Language Models peaked? An analysis of inter- and intra-LLM variability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12320)
*Jennifer Haase,Paul H. P. Hanel,Sebastian Pokutta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管LLMs在创意任务中表现优异，但其创意能力并未随时间提升，且输出存在显著的不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs的创意能力是否随时间提升，以及其创意输出的稳定性。

Method: 使用Divergent Association Task (DAT)和Alternative Uses Task (AUT)评估14种LLMs的创意表现。

Result: LLMs的创意表现未随时间提升，GPT-4表现下降；AUT中LLMs平均优于人类，但极少达到人类顶尖水平；同一模型输出差异显著。

Conclusion: 需更细致的评估框架，重视模型选择、提示设计和重复评估，以准确衡量LLMs的创意潜力。

Abstract: Following the widespread adoption of ChatGPT in early 2023, numerous studies
reported that large language models (LLMs) can match or even surpass human
performance in creative tasks. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs have
become more creative over time, and how consistent their creative output is. In
this study, we evaluated 14 widely used LLMs -- including GPT-4, Claude, Llama,
Grok, Mistral, and DeepSeek -- across two validated creativity assessments: the
Divergent Association Task (DAT) and the Alternative Uses Task (AUT). Contrary
to expectations, we found no evidence of increased creative performance over
the past 18-24 months, with GPT-4 performing worse than in previous studies.
For the more widely used AUT, all models performed on average better than the
average human, with GPT-4o and o3-mini performing best. However, only 0.28% of
LLM-generated responses reached the top 10% of human creativity benchmarks.
Beyond inter-model differences, we document substantial intra-model
variability: the same LLM, given the same prompt, can produce outputs ranging
from below-average to original. This variability has important implications for
both creativity research and practical applications. Ignoring such variability
risks misjudging the creative potential of LLMs, either inflating or
underestimating their capabilities. The choice of prompts affected LLMs
differently. Our findings underscore the need for more nuanced evaluation
frameworks and highlight the importance of model selection, prompt design, and
repeated assessment when using Generative AI (GenAI) tools in creative
contexts.

### [10] [AttentionDefense: Leveraging System Prompt Attention for Explainable Defense Against Novel Jailbreaks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12321)
*Charlotte Siska,Anush Sankaran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为AttentionDefense的新型防御方法，利用小型语言模型（SLM）的系统提示注意力机制来检测和解释对抗性提示，性能优于现有方法且计算成本低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语言模型（LM）在多个领域表现出色，但其易受恶意输入（jailbreak）攻击，导致偏离预期行为。现有防御方法难以解释恶意行为的根源，因此需要一种更透明且高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出AttentionDefense方法，通过SLM的系统提示注意力机制分析对抗性提示，提供可解释的防御策略。

Result: 实验表明，AttentionDefense在检测jailbreak方面优于基于文本嵌入的分类器和GPT-4零样本检测器，并在新型jailbreak数据集上表现稳健。

Conclusion: AttentionDefense是一种高效、可解释且计算成本低的防御方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: In the past few years, Language Models (LMs) have shown par-human
capabilities in several domains. Despite their practical applications and
exceeding user consumption, they are susceptible to jailbreaks when malicious
input exploits the LM's weaknesses, causing it to deviate from its intended
behavior. Current defensive strategies either classify the input prompt as
adversarial or prevent LMs from generating harmful outputs. However, it is
challenging to explain the reason behind the malicious nature of the jailbreak,
which results in a wide variety of closed-box approaches. In this research, we
propose and demonstrate that system-prompt attention from Small Language Models
(SLMs) can be used to characterize adversarial prompts, providing a novel,
explainable, and cheaper defense approach called AttentionDefense. Our research
suggests that the attention mechanism is an integral component in understanding
and explaining how LMs respond to malicious input that is not captured in the
semantic meaning of text embeddings. The proposed AttentionDefense is evaluated
against existing jailbreak benchmark datasets. Ablation studies show that
SLM-based AttentionDefense has equivalent or better jailbreak detection
performance compared to text embedding-based classifiers and GPT-4 zero-shot
detectors.To further validate the efficacy of the proposed approach, we
generate a dataset of novel jailbreak variants of the existing benchmark
dataset using a closed-loop LLM-based multi-agent system. We demonstrate that
the proposed AttentionDefense approach performs robustly on this novel
jailbreak dataset while existing approaches suffer in performance.
Additionally, for practical purposes AttentionDefense is an ideal solution as
it has the computation requirements of a small LM but the performance of a LLM
detector.

*Xin Gao,Qizhi Pei,Zinan Tang,Yu Li,Honglin Lin,Jiang Wu,Conghui He,Lijun Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRA框架通过协作多个小型LLM（生成器、审阅者和裁决者）模拟同行评审流程，实现高质量数据合成，挑战了大型LLM的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前依赖大型LLM的数据合成方法存在高成本、低效率和潜在偏见问题，而小型LLM虽可持续但能力不足。

Method: 提出GRA框架，通过多个小型LLM分工协作（生成、评审、裁决）模拟同行评审流程。

Result: 实验表明GRA生成的数据质量与大型LLM相当或更优。

Conclusion: 协作小型LLM可替代大型LLM进行高质量数据合成，更具可持续性和效率。

Abstract: While data synthesis and distillation are promising strategies to enhance
small language models, current approaches heavily rely on Large Language Models
(LLMs), which suffer from high computational costs, environmental inefficiency,
and potential biases inherited from monolithic architectures. In contrast,
smaller LLMs are more accessible and sustainable, but their individual
capabilities often fall short in generating high-quality, diverse, and reliable
data. Inspired by collaborative human processes (e.g., peer review), we propose
a multiple small LLMs involved framework, GRA, that aggregates specialized
roles across small LLMs to iterative refinement and quality control typically
achieved by a single large LLM. In this collaborative framework, multiple small
LLMs assume distinct roles-Generator, Reviewer, and Adjudicator-to simulate a
peer-review-inspired data synthesis pipeline. The Generator proposes initial
data samples, the Reviewer critiques their quality and diversity, and the
Adjudicator resolves conflicts to finalize the output. By decomposing the
synthesis process into specialized sub-tasks, collaborative small LLMs can
achieve data-level parity with large LLM-based distillation. Through
experiments across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that GRA-produced data
matches or exceeds the quality of single large LLM outputs, e.g.,
Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct. Our results challenge the necessity of monolithic large
models for high-quality data synthesis, advocating instead for strategic
coordination of smaller agents. Our datasets, models, and code are publicly
available at https://github.com/GX-XinGao/GRA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAG通过引入外部知识减少LLMs的幻觉问题，但可能加剧小规模LLMs的不公平性。研究提出FairFT和FairFilter方法，有效改善公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨RAG框架对LLMs公平性的影响，尤其是在小规模模型中的不公平问题。

Method: 通过实验分析不同LLMs、检索器和检索源的影响，提出FairFT（公平对齐检索器）和FairFilter（公平过滤机制）两种方法。

Result: 实验显示，小规模LLMs（<8B）在RAG中更容易出现不公平问题，提出的方法能显著改善公平性且不影响性能。

Conclusion: FairFT和FairFilter是解决RAG在小规模LLMs中公平性问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
retrieving relevant document from external knowledge sources. By referencing
this external knowledge, RAG effectively reduces the generation of factually
incorrect content and addresses hallucination issues within LLMs. Recently,
there has been growing attention to improving the performance and efficiency of
RAG systems from various perspectives. While these advancements have yielded
significant results, the application of RAG in domains with considerable
societal implications raises a critical question about fairness: What impact
does the introduction of the RAG paradigm have on the fairness of LLMs? To
address this question, we conduct extensive experiments by varying the LLMs,
retrievers, and retrieval sources. Our experimental analysis reveals that the
scale of the LLMs plays a significant role in influencing fairness outcomes
within the RAG framework. When the model scale is smaller than 8B, the
integration of retrieval mechanisms often exacerbates unfairness in small-scale
LLMs (e.g., LLaMA3.2-1B, Mistral-7B, and LLaMA3-8B). To mitigate the fairness
issues introduced by RAG for small-scale LLMs, we propose two approaches,
FairFT and FairFilter. Specifically, in FairFT, we align the retriever with the
LLM in terms of fairness, enabling it to retrieve documents that facilitate
fairer model outputs. In FairFilter, we propose a fairness filtering mechanism
to filter out biased content after retrieval. Finally, we validate our proposed
approaches on real-world datasets, demonstrating their effectiveness in
improving fairness while maintaining performance.

*Mengying Yuan,Wangzi Xuan,Fei Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的跨文档跨语言自然语言推理（CDCL-NLI）范式，构建了一个高质量的数据集，并提出了一种结合RST增强图融合和可解释性预测的创新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨文档跨语言NLI（CDCL-NLI）尚未被充分探索，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一种结合RST增强的RGAT进行跨文档上下文建模，以及基于词汇链的结构感知语义对齐机制。此外，开发了EDU级别的可解释性框架。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于传统NLI模型和大型语言模型（如Llama3和GPT-4o）。

Conclusion: 本文为NLI研究提供了新视角，并推动了跨文档跨语言上下文理解、语义检索和可解释性推理的研究。

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is a fundamental task in both natural
language processing and information retrieval. While NLI has developed many
sub-directions such as sentence-level NLI, document-level NLI and cross-lingual
NLI, Cross-Document Cross-Lingual NLI (CDCL-NLI) remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for CDCL-NLI that extends traditional
NLI capabilities to multi-document, multilingual scenarios. To support this
task, we construct a high-quality CDCL-NLI dataset including 1,110 instances
and spanning 26 languages. To build a baseline for this task, we also propose
an innovative method that integrates RST-enhanced graph fusion and
interpretability prediction. Our method employs RST (Rhetorical Structure
Theory) on RGAT (Relation-aware Graph Attention Network) for cross-document
context modeling, coupled with a structure-aware semantic alignment mechanism
based on lexical chains for cross-lingual understanding. For NLI
interpretability, we develop an EDU-level attribution framework that generates
extractive explanations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach's
superior performance, achieving significant improvements over both traditional
NLI models such as DocNLI and R2F, as well as LLMs like Llama3 and GPT-4o. Our
work sheds light on the study of NLI and will bring research interest on

TL;DR: LLMTaxo是一个利用大语言模型自动构建社交媒体事实声明分类框架，通过多粒度生成主题，帮助用户更高效地导航社交媒体内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体内容的爆炸式增长，分析和理解在线讨论变得日益复杂，需要一种自动化工具来分类事实声明。

Method: LLMTaxo框架利用大语言模型，从多粒度生成主题，并在三个不同数据集上实现，同时设计了专门的分类评估指标。

Result: 实验表明，LLMTaxo能有效分类社交媒体事实声明，且某些模型在特定数据集上表现更优。

Conclusion: LLMTaxo为社交媒体内容分类提供了有效工具，未来可进一步优化模型在不同场景下的表现。

Abstract: With the vast expansion of content on social media platforms, analyzing and
comprehending online discourse has become increasingly complex. This paper
introduces LLMTaxo, a novel framework leveraging large language models for the
automated construction of taxonomy of factual claims from social media by
generating topics from multi-level granularities. This approach aids
stakeholders in more effectively navigating the social media landscapes. We
implement this framework with different models across three distinct datasets
and introduce specially designed taxonomy evaluation metrics for a
comprehensive assessment. With the evaluations from both human evaluators and
GPT-4, the results indicate that LLMTaxo effectively categorizes factual claims
from social media, and reveals that certain models perform better on specific
datasets.

*Shahriar Noroozizadeh,Jeremy C. Weiss*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用大语言模型从临床病例报告中提取时间定位发现的管道，并生成了一个关于Sepsis-3的开放文本时间序列语料库。验证结果显示高恢复率和强时间排序能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床病例报告和出院总结虽然完整准确，但通常在事后完成。结构化数据流虽更早可用但不完整。研究旨在利用更完整且时间精细的数据训练模型。

Method: 构建管道，利用大语言模型对病例报告中的时间定位发现进行表型提取和标注，生成Sepsis-3的文本时间序列语料库。

Result: 验证结果显示高恢复率（事件匹配率：O1-preview--0.755，Llama 3.3 70B Instruct--0.753）和强时间排序（一致性：O1-preview--0.932，Llama 3.3 70B Instruct--0.932）。

Conclusion: 研究展示了大语言模型在时间定位临床发现中的能力，但也指出了其在时间重建中的局限性，并提出了多模态整合的改进方向。

Abstract: Clinical case reports and discharge summaries may be the most complete and
accurate summarization of patient encounters, yet they are finalized, i.e.,
timestamped after the encounter. Complementary data structured streams become
available sooner but suffer from incompleteness. To train models and algorithms
on more complete and temporally fine-grained data, we construct a pipeline to
phenotype, extract, and annotate time-localized findings within case reports
using large language models. We apply our pipeline to generate an open-access
textual time series corpus for Sepsis-3 comprising 2,139 case reports from the
Pubmed-Open Access (PMOA) Subset. To validate our system, we apply it on PMOA
and timeline annotations from I2B2/MIMIC-IV and compare the results to
physician-expert annotations. We show high recovery rates of clinical findings
(event match rates: O1-preview--0.755, Llama 3.3 70B Instruct--0.753) and
strong temporal ordering (concordance: O1-preview--0.932, Llama 3.3 70B
Instruct--0.932). Our work characterizes the ability of LLMs to time-localize
clinical findings in text, illustrating the limitations of LLM use for temporal
reconstruction and providing several potential avenues of improvement via
multimodal integration.

TL;DR: 该研究首次大规模分析了中国官方媒体（1950-2019）中社会群体的语言表征，发现其与西方模式显著不同，尤其是经济地位、种族和性别方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨革命性社会变革如何通过官方语言表征反映社会群体，填补非西方背景下语言编码社会信念的研究空白。

Method: 使用历时词嵌入方法，分析中国官方媒体在不同时间分辨率下的语言数据。

Result: 中国社会群体的语言表征在种族、年龄和体型方面稳定，而性别和经济阶层则随历史变革发生显著变化。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了官方话语如何通过语言编码社会结构，并强调了非西方视角在计算社会科学中的重要性。

Abstract: Language encodes societal beliefs about social groups through word patterns.
While computational methods like word embeddings enable quantitative analysis
of these patterns, studies have primarily examined gradual shifts in Western
contexts. We present the first large-scale computational analysis of Chinese
state-controlled media (1950-2019) to examine how revolutionary social
transformations are reflected in official linguistic representations of social
groups. Using diachronic word embeddings at multiple temporal resolutions, we
find that Chinese representations differ significantly from Western
counterparts, particularly regarding economic status, ethnicity, and gender.
These representations show distinct evolutionary dynamics: while stereotypes of
ethnicity, age, and body type remain remarkably stable across political
upheavals, representations of gender and economic classes undergo dramatic
shifts tracking historical transformations. This work advances our
understanding of how officially sanctioned discourse encodes social structure
through language while highlighting the importance of non-Western perspectives
in computational social science.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的框架Speculative Thinking，通过大模型指导小模型在推理时提升性能，显著提高准确率并缩短输出长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后训练方法成本高且输出冗长，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 利用大模型控制小模型的推理行为，通过特定信号（如“wait”）优化推理过程。

Result: 1.5B模型在MATH500上的准确率提升6.2%，输出长度减少15.7%；非推理模型Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct准确率提升7.8%。

Conclusion: Speculative Thinking是一种高效、无需训练的方法，显著提升模型推理性能。

Abstract: Recent advances leverage post-training to enhance model reasoning
performance, which typically requires costly training pipelines and still
suffers from inefficient, overly lengthy outputs. We introduce Speculative
Thinking, a training-free framework that enables large reasoning models to
guide smaller ones during inference at the reasoning level, distinct from
speculative decoding, which operates at the token level. Our approach is based
on two observations: (1) reasoning-supportive tokens such as "wait" frequently
appear after structural delimiters like "\n\n", serving as signals for
reflection or continuation; and (2) larger models exhibit stronger control over
reflective behavior, reducing unnecessary backtracking while improving
reasoning quality. By strategically delegating reflective steps to a more
capable model, our method significantly boosts the reasoning accuracy of
reasoning models while shortening their output. With the assistance of the 32B
reasoning model, the 1.5B model's accuracy on MATH500 increases from 83.2% to
89.4%, marking a substantial improvement of 6.2%. Simultaneously, the average
output length is reduced from 5439 tokens to 4583 tokens, representing a 15.7%
decrease. Moreover, when applied to a non-reasoning model
(Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct), our framework boosts its accuracy from 74.0% to 81.8%
on the same benchmark, achieving a relative improvement of 7.8%.

TL;DR: HM-RAG是一种新型的多层次多代理多模态RAG框架，通过协作智能解决复杂查询问题，显著提升了答案准确性和问题分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单代理RAG在处理需要跨异构数据协调推理的复杂查询时存在局限性。

Method: 采用三层架构：分解代理、多源检索代理和决策代理，结合语义查询重写、多模态检索和一致性投票。

Result: 在ScienceQA和CrisisMMD基准测试中，答案准确性提升12.95%，问题分类准确性提升3.56%。

Conclusion: HM-RAG在零样本设置下表现优异，模块化架构支持新数据模态的无缝集成，推动了多模态推理和知识合成的进展。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) augments Large Language Models
(LLMs) with external knowledge, conventional single-agent RAG remains
fundamentally limited in resolving complex queries demanding coordinated
reasoning across heterogeneous data ecosystems. We present HM-RAG, a novel
Hierarchical Multi-agent Multimodal RAG framework that pioneers collaborative
intelligence for dynamic knowledge synthesis across structured, unstructured,
and graph-based data. The framework is composed of three-tiered architecture
with specialized agents: a Decomposition Agent that dissects complex queries
into contextually coherent sub-tasks via semantic-aware query rewriting and
schema-guided context augmentation; Multi-source Retrieval Agents that carry
out parallel, modality-specific retrieval using plug-and-play modules designed
for vector, graph, and web-based databases; and a Decision Agent that uses
consistency voting to integrate multi-source answers and resolve discrepancies
in retrieval results through Expert Model Refinement. This architecture attains
comprehensive query understanding by combining textual, graph-relational, and
web-derived evidence, resulting in a remarkable 12.95% improvement in answer
accuracy and a 3.56% boost in question classification accuracy over baseline
RAG systems on the ScienceQA and CrisisMMD benchmarks. Notably, HM-RAG
establishes state-of-the-art results in zero-shot settings on both datasets.
Its modular architecture ensures seamless integration of new data modalities
while maintaining strict data governance, marking a significant advancement in
addressing the critical challenges of multimodal reasoning and knowledge
synthesis in RAG systems. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型的细粒度情感-原因-类别三元组提取方法，通过指令调优和数据增强技术显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在情感-原因对提取和检测中存在冗余信息检索和情感类别确定不准确的问题，尤其是隐式或模糊情感表达时。

Method: 采用任务特定的三元组提取指令和低秩适应技术微调大语言模型，结合提示引导的数据增强策略生成高质量合成数据。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在情感-原因-类别三元组提取指标上至少提升了12.8%，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效且鲁棒，为情感原因分析研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Span-level emotion-cause-category triplet extraction represents a novel and
complex challenge within emotion cause analysis. This task involves identifying
emotion spans, cause spans, and their associated emotion categories within the
text to form structured triplets. While prior research has predominantly
concentrated on clause-level emotion-cause pair extraction and span-level
emotion-cause detection, these methods often confront challenges originating
from redundant information retrieval and difficulty in accurately determining
emotion categories, particularly when emotions are expressed implicitly or
ambiguously. To overcome these challenges, this study explores a fine-grained
approach to span-level emotion-cause-category triplet extraction and introduces
an innovative framework that leverages instruction tuning and data augmentation
techniques based on large language models. The proposed method employs
task-specific triplet extraction instructions and utilizes low-rank adaptation
to fine-tune large language models, eliminating the necessity for intricate
task-specific architectures. Furthermore, a prompt-based data augmentation
strategy is developed to address data scarcity by guiding large language models
in generating high-quality synthetic training data. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms
existing baseline methods, achieving at least a 12.8% improvement in span-level
emotion-cause-category triplet extraction metrics. The results demonstrate the
method's effectiveness and robustness, offering a promising avenue for
advancing research in emotion cause analysis. The source code is available at

Motivation: 探讨LLM的能力是否真正接近人类能力，并量化其表现。

Method: 收集80多个LLM在37个评估基准上的数据，按人类能力分类并聚类分析。

Result: 1. 部分LLM能力可用人类指标描述；2. 人类相关能力在LLM中几乎无关；3. 能力随参数规模变化显著。

Conclusion: LLM的能力与人类能力存在差异，且受参数规模影响。

Abstract: Users of Large Language Models (LLMs) often perceive these models as
intelligent entities with human-like capabilities. However, the extent to which
LLMs' capabilities truly approximate human abilities remains a topic of debate.
In this paper, to characterize the capabilities of LLMs in relation to human
capabilities, we collected performance data from over 80 models across 37
evaluation benchmarks. The evaluation benchmarks are categorized into 6 primary
abilities and 11 sub-abilities in human aspect. Then, we then clustered the
performance rankings into several categories and compared these clustering
results with classifications based on human ability aspects. Our findings lead
to the following conclusions: 1. We have confirmed that certain capabilities of
LLMs with fewer than 10 billion parameters can indeed be described using human
ability metrics; 2. While some abilities are considered interrelated in humans,
they appear nearly uncorrelated in LLMs; 3. The capabilities possessed by LLMs
vary significantly with the parameter scale of the model.

Motivation: 开放性问题评估在严肃游戏中具有主观性，小型LLM的准确性和一致性尚不明确，因此需要研究其可靠性。

Method: 使用传统二元分类指标（如准确率、真正率和真负率）系统比较五种小型LLM在不同评估场景中的表现。

Result: 结果显示不同模型在识别正确答案、假阳性或不一致评估方面表现各异，存在性能权衡。

Conclusion: 研究强调了上下文感知评估框架的必要性，为AI驱动评估工具的信任度提供了见解。

Abstract: The evaluation of open-ended responses in serious games presents a unique
challenge, as correctness is often subjective. Large Language Models (LLMs) are
increasingly being explored as evaluators in such contexts, yet their accuracy
and consistency remain uncertain, particularly for smaller models intended for
local execution. This study investigates the reliability of five small-scale
LLMs when assessing player responses in \textit{En-join}, a game that simulates
decision-making within energy communities. By leveraging traditional binary
classification metrics (including accuracy, true positive rate, and true
negative rate), we systematically compare these models across different
evaluation scenarios. Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of
each model, revealing trade-offs between sensitivity, specificity, and overall
performance. We demonstrate that while some models excel at identifying correct
responses, others struggle with false positives or inconsistent evaluations.
The findings highlight the need for context-aware evaluation frameworks and
careful model selection when deploying LLMs as evaluators. This work
contributes to the broader discourse on the trustworthiness of AI-driven
assessment tools, offering insights into how different LLM architectures handle
subjective evaluation tasks.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在复杂医学任务中因术语和临床数据敏感性导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 采用树状思维（ToT）分解医学问题，结合评估层，并提出基于ToT的数据蒸馏方法。

Result: 在MedQAUSMLE数据集上，LLaMA2-70b准确率从34%提升至50%，LLaMA-3.1-8b从58.77%提升至69.49%；数据蒸馏方法仅用3.9%数据实现86.27%性能提升。

Conclusion: QM-ToT首次展示了ToT在复杂医学任务中的潜力，为资源受限医疗环境中部署高性能量化模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in specialized
biomedical tasks due to the inherent complexity of medical reasoning and the
sensitive nature of clinical data. Existing LLMs often struggle with intricate
medical terminology and the need for accurate clinical insights, leading to
performance reduction when quantized for resource-constrained deployment. To
address these issues, we propose Quantized Medical Tree of Thought (QM-ToT), a
path-based reasoning framework. QM-ToT leverages a Tree of Thought (ToT)
reasoning approach to decompose complex medical problems into manageable
subtasks, coupled with evaluator assessment layers. This framework facilitates
substantial performance improvements in INT4-quantized models on the
challenging MedQAUSMLE dataset. Specifically, we demonstrate a remarkable
accuracy increase from 34% to 50% for the LLaMA2-70b model and from 58.77% to
69.49% for LLaMA-3.1-8b. Besides, we also proposed an effect data distillation
method based on ToT. Compared to the traditional distillation method, we
achieved an improvement of 86. 27% while using only 3.9% of the data.This work,
for the first time, showcases the potential of ToT to significantly enhance
performance on complex biomedical tasks, establishing a crucial foundation for
future advances in deploying high-performing quantized LLM in resource-limited
medical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM通常通过API提供服务，开发者难以检测其行为变化，因此需要一种高效的方法来监控模型变化。

Method: 使用统计测试比较两组文本样本的特征分布，判断模型是否发生变化。

Result: 实验表明，简单的文本特征结合统计测试可以有效区分不同语言模型，并能检测提示注入攻击。

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效监控LLM变化，避免了计算成本高昂的基准评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often provided as a service via an API,
making it challenging for developers to detect changes in their behavior. We
present an approach to monitor LLMs for changes by comparing the distributions
of linguistic and psycholinguistic features of generated text. Our method uses
a statistical test to determine whether the distributions of features from two
samples of text are equivalent, allowing developers to identify when an LLM has
changed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using five OpenAI
completion models and Meta's Llama 3 70B chat model. Our results show that
simple text features coupled with a statistical test can distinguish between
language models. We also explore the use of our approach to detect prompt
injection attacks. Our work enables frequent LLM change monitoring and avoids
computationally expensive benchmark evaluations.

Result: 20%的评论反映个人使用，用户态度积极，主要受益包括可访问性和情感支持，但也存在隐私和缺乏专业监督的问题。

Conclusion: AI在心理健康支持中的应用日益重要，但需加强临床和伦理审查。

Abstract: The emergence of generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT has prompted growing
public and academic interest in their role as informal mental health support
tools. While early rule-based systems have been around for several years, large
language models (LLMs) offer new capabilities in conversational fluency,
empathy simulation, and availability. This study explores how users engage with
LLMs as mental health tools by analyzing over 10,000 TikTok comments from
videos referencing LLMs as mental health tools. Using a self-developed tiered
coding schema and supervised classification models, we identify user
experiences, attitudes, and recurring themes. Results show that nearly 20% of
comments reflect personal use, with these users expressing overwhelmingly
positive attitudes. Commonly cited benefits include accessibility, emotional
support, and perceived therapeutic value. However, concerns around privacy,
generic responses, and the lack of professional oversight remain prominent. It
is important to note that the user feedback does not indicate which therapeutic
framework, if any, the LLM-generated output aligns with. While the findings
underscore the growing relevance of AI in everyday practices, they also
highlight the urgent need for clinical and ethical scrutiny in the use of AI
for mental health support.

Result: GPT模型单独使用已优于传统模型，结合两者后AUC平均提升5.1%，高风险组阳性预测值提升29.9%。

Conclusion: 研究表明LLMs在临床预测任务中具有重要价值，尤其在非结构化文本数据未被充分利用的领域。

Abstract: There is a long history of building predictive models in healthcare using
tabular data from electronic medical records. However, these models fail to
extract the information found in unstructured clinical notes, which document
diagnosis, treatment, progress, medications, and care plans. In this study, we
investigate how answers generated by GPT-4o-mini (ChatGPT) to simple clinical
questions about patients, when given access to the patient's discharge summary,
can support patient-level mortality prediction. Using data from 14,011
first-time admissions to the Coronary Care or Cardiovascular Intensive Care
Units in the MIMIC-IV Note dataset, we implement a transparent framework that
uses GPT responses as input features in logistic regression models. Our
findings demonstrate that GPT-based models alone can outperform models trained
on standard tabular data, and that combining both sources of information yields
even greater predictive power, increasing AUC by an average of 5.1 percentage
points and increasing positive predictive value by 29.9 percent for the
highest-risk decile. These results highlight the value of integrating large
language models (LLMs) into clinical prediction tasks and underscore the
broader potential for using LLMs in any domain where unstructured text data
remains an underutilized resource.

Result: 实验表明GOAT-TTS性能接近SOTA，并验证了方言语音合成的有效性。

Conclusion: GOAT-TTS通过双分支设计解决了LLM在TTS中的核心问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized text-to-speech (TTS)
synthesis through discrete tokenization paradigms, current architectures
exhibit fundamental tensions between three critical dimensions: 1) irreversible
loss of acoustic characteristics caused by quantization of speech prompts; 2)
stringent dependence on precisely aligned prompt speech-text pairs that limit
real-world deployment; and 3) catastrophic forgetting of the LLM's native text
comprehension during optimization for speech token generation. To address these
challenges, we propose an LLM-based text-to-speech Generation approach
Optimized via a novel dual-branch ArchiTecture (GOAT-TTS). Our framework
introduces two key innovations: (1) The modality-alignment branch combines a
speech encoder and projector to capture continuous acoustic embeddings,
enabling bidirectional correlation between paralinguistic features (language,
timbre, emotion) and semantic text representations without transcript
dependency; (2) The speech-generation branch employs modular fine-tuning on
top-k layers of an LLM for speech token prediction while freezing the bottom-k
layers to preserve foundational linguistic knowledge. Moreover, multi-token
prediction is introduced to support real-time streaming TTS synthesis.
Experimental results demonstrate that our GOAT-TTS achieves performance
comparable to state-of-the-art TTS models while validating the efficacy of
synthesized dialect speech data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了首个针对生物制药领域的检索增强大语言模型（LLMs）评估基准BRAGE，并提出了一种基于引用的分类方法评估LLMs的查询与参考理解能力（QRUC）。实验显示主流LLMs在生物制药领域的QRUC存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏专门针对生物制药领域的LLMs评估基准，且传统QA指标在开放式检索增强QA场景中表现不足。

Method: 提出BRAGE基准和基于引用的分类方法，评估LLMs在生物制药领域的QRUC。

Result: 实验结果表明主流LLMs在生物制药领域的QRUC存在显著差距，需改进。

Conclusion: BRAGE填补了生物制药领域LLMs评估的空白，基于引用的方法为开放式QA提供了更有效的评估手段。

Abstract: Recently, the application of the retrieval-augmented Large Language Models
(LLMs) in specific domains has gained significant attention, especially in
biopharmaceuticals. However, in this context, there is no benchmark
specifically designed for biopharmaceuticals to evaluate LLMs. In this paper,
we introduce the Biopharmaceuticals Retrieval-Augmented Generation Evaluation
(BRAGE) , the first benchmark tailored for evaluating LLMs' Query and Reference
Understanding Capability (QRUC) in the biopharmaceutical domain, available in
English, French, German and Chinese. In addition, Traditional
Question-Answering (QA) metrics like accuracy and exact match fall short in the
open-ended retrieval-augmented QA scenarios. To address this, we propose a
citation-based classification method to evaluate the QRUC of LLMs to understand
the relationship between queries and references. We apply this method to
evaluate the mainstream LLMs on BRAGE. Experimental results show that there is
a significant gap in the biopharmaceutical QRUC of mainstream LLMs, and their
QRUC needs to be improved.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对大语言模型（LLMs）中语义后门攻击的黑盒检测框架RAVEN，通过结合语义熵和跨模型一致性分析，成功检测到传统方法忽略的语义后门。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在多种语言任务中表现优异，但仍易受后门攻击。传统防御方法仅关注显式的词级异常，忽略了基于语义的隐蔽后门。

Method: 提出RAVEN框架，通过结构化主题-视角提示探测多个模型，利用双向蕴含聚类响应，并通过跨模型比较识别异常输出。

Result: 在多种LLM家族（如GPT-4o、Llama等）中发现了此前未检测到的语义后门，验证了其可行性。

Conclusion: 语义后门的存在凸显了对部署语言模型进行概念级审计的紧迫性，RAVEN为检测此类漏洞提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across myriad
language tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where
adversaries implant hidden triggers that systematically manipulate model
outputs. Traditional defenses focus on explicit token-level anomalies and
therefore overlook semantic backdoors-covert triggers embedded at the
conceptual level (e.g., ideological stances or cultural references) that rely
on meaning-based cues rather than lexical oddities. We first show, in a
controlled finetuning setting, that such semantic backdoors can be implanted
with only a small poisoned corpus, establishing their practical feasibility. We
then formalize the notion of semantic backdoors in LLMs and introduce a
black-box detection framework, RAVEN (short for "Response Anomaly Vigilance for
uncovering semantic backdoors"), which combines semantic entropy with
cross-model consistency analysis. The framework probes multiple models with
structured topic-perspective prompts, clusters the sampled responses via
bidirectional entailment, and flags anomalously uniform outputs; cross-model
comparison isolates model-specific anomalies from corpus-wide biases. Empirical
evaluations across diverse LLM families (GPT-4o, Llama, DeepSeek, Mistral)
uncover previously undetected semantic backdoors, providing the first
proof-of-concept evidence of these hidden vulnerabilities and underscoring the
urgent need for concept-level auditing of deployed language models. We
open-source our code and data at https://github.com/NayMyatMin/RAVEN.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市因果研究面临假设生成效率低、数据复杂性和方法脆弱性等挑战，LLM的发展为解决这些问题提供了新机会。

Method: 通过分析现有研究的分类法，提出由四个模块化代理组成的AutoUrbanCI框架，涵盖假设生成、数据工程、实验设计与执行、结果解释与政策建议。

Result: 提出了评估标准，强调严谨性和透明度，并探讨了人机协作、公平性和问责制的意义。

Conclusion: 呼吁采用AI增强的工作流程，以扩大参与、提高可重复性，并实现更包容的城市因果推理。

Abstract: Urban causal research is essential for understanding the complex dynamics of
cities and informing evidence-based policies. However, it is challenged by the
inefficiency and bias of hypothesis generation, barriers to multimodal data
complexity, and the methodological fragility of causal experimentation. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) present an opportunity to rethink how
urban causal analysis is conducted. This Perspective examines current urban
causal research by analyzing taxonomies that categorize research topics, data
sources, and methodological approaches to identify structural gaps. We then
introduce an LLM-driven conceptual framework, AutoUrbanCI, composed of four
distinct modular agents responsible for hypothesis generation, data
engineering, experiment design and execution, and results interpretation with
policy recommendations. We propose evaluation criteria for rigor and
transparency and reflect on implications for human-AI collaboration, equity,
and accountability. We call for a new research agenda that embraces
AI-augmented workflows not as replacements for human expertise but as tools to
broaden participation, improve reproducibility, and unlock more inclusive forms
of urban causal reasoning.

Result: 初期表现中等，后期显著提升，部分模型达到完美分数。

Conclusion: LLMs数学能力快速进步，具备支持大规模教育评估的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown increasing promise in educational
settings, yet their mathematical reasoning has been considered evolving. This
study evaluates the mathematical capabilities of various LLMs using the Finnish
matriculation examination, a high-stakes digital test for upper secondary
education. Initial tests yielded moderate performance corresponding to
mid-range grades, but later evaluations demonstrated substantial improvements
as the language models evolved. Remarkably, some models achieved near-perfect
or perfect scores, matching top student performance and qualifying for
university admission. Our findings highlight the rapid advances in the
mathematical proficiency of LLMs and illustrate their potential to also support
educational assessments at scale.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将病例报告转化为结构化时间序列数据的系统，对比了人工和大型语言模型（LLM）的标注效果，发现LLM在事件召回率上表现中等，但在时间一致性上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床事件的时间信息对患者轨迹分析至关重要，但电子健康记录中缺乏结构化时间数据，临床报告也缺少事件的时间定位。

Method: 开发了一个系统，将病例报告转化为文本时间序列数据，对比了人工和LLM的标注效果，并评估了LLM之间的一致性。

Result: LLM在事件召回率上表现中等（0.80），但在时间一致性上表现优异（0.95）。

Conclusion: 该研究为利用PMOA语料库进行时间分析提供了基准，展示了LLM在时间一致性上的潜力。

Abstract: Timing of clinical events is central to characterization of patient
trajectories, enabling analyses such as process tracing, forecasting, and
causal reasoning. However, structured electronic health records capture few
data elements critical to these tasks, while clinical reports lack temporal
localization of events in structured form. We present a system that transforms
case reports into textual time series-structured pairs of textual events and
timestamps. We contrast manual and large language model (LLM) annotations
(n=320 and n=390 respectively) of ten randomly-sampled PubMed open-access
(PMOA) case reports (N=152,974) and assess inter-LLM agreement (n=3,103; N=93).
We find that the LLM models have moderate event recall(O1-preview: 0.80) but
high temporal concordance among identified events (O1-preview: 0.95). By
establishing the task, annotation, and assessment systems, and by demonstrating
high concordance, this work may serve as a benchmark for leveraging the PMOA
corpus for temporal analytics.

Motivation: 传统研究方法在药物过量监测中存在局限性，而社交媒体提供了实时数据，为公共卫生监测提供了新途径。

Method: 采用混合标注策略（LLMs和人工标注），结合传统机器学习、神经网络和基于Transformer的模型。

Result: 框架在多类和多标签分类中分别达到98%和97%的准确率，优于基线模型8%。

Conclusion: AI在公共卫生监测和个性化干预中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Drug overdose remains a critical global health issue, often driven by misuse
of opioids, painkillers, and psychiatric medications. Traditional research
methods face limitations, whereas social media offers real-time insights into
self-reported substance use and overdose symptoms. This study proposes an
AI-driven NLP framework trained on annotated social media data to detect
commonly used drugs and associated overdose symptoms. Using a hybrid annotation
strategy with LLMs and human annotators, we applied traditional ML models,
neural networks, and advanced transformer-based models. Our framework achieved
98% accuracy in multi-class and 97% in multi-label classification,
outperforming baseline models by up to 8%. These findings highlight the

Abstract: Validating Large Language Models with ReLM explores the application of formal
languages to evaluate and control Large Language Models (LLMs) for
memorization, bias, and zero-shot performance. Current approaches for
evaluating these types behavior are often slow, imprecise, costly, or introduce
biases of their own, but are necessary due to the importance of this behavior
when productionizing LLMs. This project reproduces key results from the
original ReLM paper and expounds on the approach and applications with an
emphasis on the relevance to the field of systems for machine learning.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of Graph Spectral Clustering with

application of methods curing similarity negativity leads to accuracy
improvement for both combinatorial and normalized Laplacian based GSC. It also
leads to applicability for GloVe embeddings of explanation methods developed
originally bythe authors for Term Vector Space embeddings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇立场论文主张为LLM训练数据生产者提供补偿，并估算其成本远高于模型训练本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM训练数据的背后是大量未获补偿的人类劳动，论文旨在量化这一成本并推动公平实践。

Method: 研究了2016年至2024年发布的64个LLM，估算从零开始生产训练数据的成本。

Result: 训练数据成本是模型训练成本的10-1000倍，凸显财务责任。

Conclusion: 呼吁未来研究关注更公平的数据补偿机制。

Abstract: Training a state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) is an increasingly
expensive endeavor due to growing computational, hardware, energy, and
engineering demands. Yet, an often-overlooked (and seldom paid) expense is the
human labor behind these models' training data. Every LLM is built on an
unfathomable amount of human effort: trillions of carefully written words
sourced from books, academic papers, codebases, social media, and more. This
position paper aims to assign a monetary value to this labor and argues that
the most expensive part of producing an LLM should be the compensation provided
to training data producers for their work. To support this position, we study
64 LLMs released between 2016 and 2024, estimating what it would cost to pay
people to produce their training datasets from scratch. Even under highly
conservative estimates of wage rates, the costs of these models' training
datasets are 10-1000 times larger than the costs to train the models
themselves, representing a significant financial liability for LLM providers.
In the face of the massive gap between the value of training data and the lack
of compensation for its creation, we highlight and discuss research directions
that could enable fairer practices in the future.

Motivation: 理解预训练数据如何影响语言模型的表示，特别是线性表示的形成因素。

Result: 线性表示与术语频率高度相关，回归模型能有效预测预训练数据频率。

Conclusion: 线性表示强度揭示了预训练数据的信号，为控制和改进模型行为提供了新途径。

Abstract: Pretraining data has a direct impact on the behaviors and quality of language
models (LMs), but we only understand the most basic principles of this
relationship. While most work focuses on pretraining data's effect on
downstream task behavior, we investigate its relationship to LM
representations. Previous work has discovered that, in language models, some
concepts are encoded `linearly' in the representations, but what factors cause
these representations to form? We study the connection between pretraining data
frequency and models' linear representations of factual relations. We find
evidence that the formation of linear representations is strongly connected to
pretraining term frequencies; specifically for subject-relation-object fact
triplets, both subject-object co-occurrence frequency and in-context learning
accuracy for the relation are highly correlated with linear representations.
This is the case across all phases of pretraining. In OLMo-7B and GPT-J, we
discover that a linear representation consistently (but not exclusively) forms
when the subjects and objects within a relation co-occur at least 1k and 2k
times, respectively, regardless of when these occurrences happen during
pretraining. Finally, we train a regression model on measurements of linear
representation quality in fully-trained LMs that can predict how often a term
was seen in pretraining. Our model achieves low error even on inputs from a
different model with a different pretraining dataset, providing a new method
for estimating properties of the otherwise-unknown training data of closed-data
models. We conclude that the strength of linear representations in LMs contains
signal about the models' pretraining corpora that may provide new avenues for
controlling and improving model behavior: particularly, manipulating the
models' training data to meet specific frequency thresholds.

Motivation: 研究动机在于现有自动谬误检测数据集多限于正式语言领域，而在线论坛的非标准化语言未被充分覆盖。

Method: 提出了SLURG方法，利用DeepHermes-3-Mistral-24B等大型语言模型生成合成谬误评论，并通过高质量少样本提示增强模型能力。

Result: 研究发现大型语言模型能复现真实数据的句法模式，且高质量少样本提示能提升模型对在线论坛词汇多样性的模仿能力。

Conclusion: 结论表明大型语言模型在生成合成谬误评论方面具有潜力，为在线论坛谬误检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: In our paper we explore the definition, and extrapolation of fallacies as
they pertain to the automatic detection of manipulation on social media. In
particular we explore how these logical fallacies might appear in the real
world i.e internet forums. We discovered a prevalence of misinformation /
misguided intention in discussion boards specifically centered around the
Ukrainian Russian Conflict which serves to narrow the domain of our task.
Although automatic fallacy detection has gained attention recently, most
datasets use unregulated fallacy taxonomies or are limited to formal linguistic
domains like political debates or news reports. Online discourse, however,
often features non-standardized and diverse language not captured in these
domains. We present Shady Linguistic Utterance Replication-Generation (SLURG)
to address these limitations, exploring the feasibility of generating synthetic
fallacious forum-style comments using large language models (LLMs),
specifically DeepHermes-3-Mistral-24B. Our findings indicate that LLMs can
replicate the syntactic patterns of real data} and that high-quality few-shot
prompts enhance LLMs' ability to mimic the vocabulary diversity of online
forums.

TL;DR: BiGTex提出了一种双向图文本融合架构，结合GNN和LLM的优势，通过参数高效微调实现节点分类和链接预测的SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本属性图（TAGs）中节点文本语义丰富性与图结构依赖性难以统一建模的问题。

Method: 提出BiGTex架构，通过堆叠的图文本融合单元实现双向注意力机制，结合GNN和LLM，并采用LoRA参数高效微调。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上实现了节点分类和链接预测的SOTA性能，并通过消融实验验证了软提示和双向注意力的重要性。

Conclusion: BiGTex通过双向融合GNN和LLM，有效解决了TAGs的表示学习问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) present unique challenges in representation
learning by requiring models to capture both the semantic richness of
node-associated texts and the structural dependencies of the graph. While graph
neural networks (GNNs) excel at modeling topological information, they lack the
capacity to process unstructured text. Conversely, large language models (LLMs)
are proficient in text understanding but are typically unaware of graph
structure. In this work, we propose BiGTex (Bidirectional Graph Text), a novel
architecture that tightly integrates GNNs and LLMs through stacked Graph-Text
Fusion Units. Each unit allows for mutual attention between textual and
structural representations, enabling information to flow in both directions,
text influencing structure and structure guiding textual interpretation. The
proposed architecture is trained using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA),
keeping the LLM frozen while adapting to task-specific signals. Extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that BiGTex achieves
state-of-the-art performance in node classification and generalizes effectively
to link prediction. An ablation study further highlights the importance of soft
prompting and bi-directional attention in the model's success.

Method: 将预训练检查点选择任务建模为成对分类问题，构建了50个1B参数LLM变体的数据集，并引入新的无监督和有监督代理指标。

Result: 传统困惑度指标被证明不可靠，新代理指标将相对性能预测误差率降低了50%以上。

Conclusion: 新方法在特定场景下具有实用价值，为优化预训练方案提供了更高效的设计思路。

Abstract: While metrics available during pre-training, such as perplexity, correlate
well with model performance at scaling-laws studies, their predictive
capacities at a fixed model size remain unclear, hindering effective model
selection and development. To address this gap, we formulate the task of
selecting pre-training checkpoints to maximize downstream fine-tuning
performance as a pairwise classification problem: predicting which of two LLMs,
differing in their pre-training, will perform better after supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). We construct a dataset using 50 1B parameter LLM variants
with systematically varied pre-training configurations, e.g., objectives or
data, and evaluate them on diverse downstream tasks after SFT. We first conduct
a study and demonstrate that the conventional perplexity is a misleading
indicator. As such, we introduce novel unsupervised and supervised proxy
metrics derived from pre-training that successfully reduce the relative
performance prediction error rate by over 50%. Despite the inherent complexity
of this task, we demonstrate the practical utility of our proposed proxies in
specific scenarios, paving the way for more efficient design of pre-training
schemes optimized for various downstream tasks.

Result: 患者级别精确度0.90，召回率0.84，F1分数0.87；识别痴呆症病例数量是结构化数据方法的三倍。

Conclusion: 混合NLP框架可行，使先进方法对资源有限的医疗机构更易用。

Abstract: Clinical natural language processing (NLP) is increasingly in demand in both
clinical research and operational practice. However, most of the
state-of-the-art solutions are transformers-based and require high
computational resources, limiting their accessibility. We propose a hybrid NLP
framework that integrates rule-based filtering, a Support Vector Machine (SVM)
classifier, and a BERT-based model to improve efficiency while maintaining
accuracy. We applied this framework in a dementia identification case study
involving 4.9 million veterans with incident hypertension, analyzing 2.1
billion clinical notes. At the patient level, our method achieved a precision
of 0.90, a recall of 0.84, and an F1-score of 0.87. Additionally, this NLP
approach identified over three times as many dementia cases as structured data
methods. All processing was completed in approximately two weeks using a single
machine with dual A40 GPUs. This study demonstrates the feasibility of hybrid
NLP solutions for large-scale clinical text analysis, making state-of-the-art
methods more accessible to healthcare organizations with limited computational
resources.

Method: 采访了16位跨两个领域的专家，分析其文档研究流程，并与现有NLP系统对比。

Result: 专家流程具有个性化、迭代性和社会背景依赖性；现有NLP方法中，以文档为中心（而非文本容器）的方法更贴近专家需求。

Conclusion: NLP社区应更注重文档的角色，开发更具可访问性、个性化、迭代性和社会意识的工具。

Abstract: Working with documents is a key part of almost any knowledge work, from
contextualizing research in a literature review to reviewing legal precedent.
Recently, as their capabilities have expanded, primarily text-based NLP systems
have often been billed as able to assist or even automate this kind of work.
But to what extent are these systems able to model these tasks as experts
conceptualize and perform them now? In this study, we interview sixteen domain
experts across two domains to understand their processes of document research,
and compare it to the current state of NLP systems. We find that our
participants processes are idiosyncratic, iterative, and rely extensively on
the social context of a document in addition its content; existing approaches
in NLP and adjacent fields that explicitly center the document as an object,
rather than as merely a container for text, tend to better reflect our
participants' priorities, though they are often less accessible outside their
research communities. We call on the NLP community to more carefully consider
the role of the document in building useful tools that are accessible,
personalizable, iterative, and socially aware.

Abstract: Recent work suggests that preference-tuning techniques--including
Reinforcement Learning from Human Preferences (RLHF) methods like PPO and GRPO,
as well as alternatives like DPO--reduce diversity, creating a dilemma given
that such models are widely deployed in applications requiring diverse outputs.
To address this, we introduce a framework for measuring effective semantic
diversity--diversity among outputs that meet quality thresholds--which better
reflects the practical utility of large language models (LLMs). Using
open-ended tasks that require no human intervention, we find counterintuitive
results: although preference-tuned models--especially those trained via
RL--exhibit reduced lexical and syntactic diversity, they produce greater
effective semantic diversity than SFT or base models, not from increasing
diversity among high-quality outputs, but from generating more high-quality
outputs overall. We discover that preference tuning reduces syntactic diversity
while preserving semantic diversity--revealing a distinction between diversity
in form and diversity in content that traditional metrics often overlook. Our
analysis further shows that smaller models are consistently more
parameter-efficient at generating unique content within a fixed sampling
budget, offering insights into the relationship between model scaling and
diversity. These findings have important implications for applications that
require diverse yet high-quality outputs, from creative assistance to synthetic
data generation.

### [46] [Memorization vs. Reasoning: Updating LLMs with New Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12523)
*Aochong Oliver Li,Tanya Goyal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了知识更新游乐场（KUP）和记忆条件训练（MCT）方法，用于解决大语言模型（LLMs）知识更新的挑战。KUP提供自动化的知识更新评估框架，MCT通过条件化训练提升模型对新知识的记忆和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注实体替换，无法全面反映复杂现实世界动态，因此需要更全面的知识更新评估和训练方法。

Method: 提出KUP框架模拟真实知识更新，并通过直接和间接探测评估模型；提出MCT方法，在训练中条件化新知识记忆。

Result: KUP基准极具挑战性，最佳CPT模型在间接探测（推理）中表现低于2%；MCT显著优于基线CPT，直接探测（记忆）提升25.4%。

Conclusion: KUP和MCT为LLMs知识更新提供了有效工具，MCT在记忆和推理方面表现突出。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of pre-trained knowledge in
their parameters, but updating them as real-world information evolves remains a
challenge. Existing methodologies and benchmarks primarily target entity
substitutions, failing to capture the full breadth of complex real-world
dynamics. In this paper, we introduce Knowledge Update Playground (KUP), an
automatic pipeline for simulating realistic knowledge updates reflected in an
evidence corpora. KUP's evaluation framework includes direct and indirect
probes to both test memorization of updated facts and reasoning over them, for
any update learning methods. Next, we present a lightweight method called
memory conditioned training (MCT), which conditions tokens in the update corpus
on self-generated "memory" tokens during training. Our strategy encourages LLMs
to surface and reason over newly memorized knowledge at inference. Our results
on two strong LLMs show that (1) KUP benchmark is highly challenging, with the
best CPT models achieving $<2\%$ in indirect probing setting (reasoning) and
(2) MCT training significantly outperforms prior continued pre-training (CPT)
baselines, improving direct probing (memorization) results by up to $25.4\%$.

TL;DR: 通过Llama 3 70B模型和“前缀提示”技术，成功从500个初始标记中高相似度重构《爱丽丝梦游仙境》整本书，但提取率因书籍流行度而异。同时发现指令调优的Llama 3.1中缓解措施失效，且仅少数权重变化导致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs能否从少量初始标记中提取整本书，并探讨书籍流行度与提取率的关系，以及指令调优对记忆提取的影响。

Method: 使用Llama 3 70B模型和前缀提示技术，尝试从500个初始标记中提取多本书，分析提取率与书籍流行度的相关性，并研究指令调优模型中的权重变化。

Result: 成功高相似度提取《爱丽丝梦游仙境》，其他书籍提取率与流行度相关。指令调优模型中缓解措施失效，仅少数权重变化导致。

Conclusion: 当前缓解策略存在局限性，指令调优可能影响LLMs的记忆提取行为，需进一步研究。

Abstract: To what extent can entire books be extracted from LLMs? Using the Llama 3 70B
family of models, and the "prefix-prompting" extraction technique, we were able
to auto-regressively reconstruct, with a very high level of similarity, one
entire book (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland) from just the first 500 tokens.
We were also able to obtain high extraction rates on several other books,
piece-wise. However, these successes do not extend uniformly to all books. We
show that extraction rates of books correlate with book popularity and thus,
likely duplication in the training data.
  We also confirm the undoing of mitigations in the instruction-tuned Llama
3.1, following recent work (Nasr et al., 2025). We further find that this
undoing comes from changes to only a tiny fraction of weights concentrated
primarily in the lower transformer blocks. Our results provide evidence of the
limits of current regurgitation mitigation strategies and introduce a framework
for studying how fine-tuning affects the retrieval of verbatim memorization in
aligned LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估框架未充分考虑波斯语言和文化背景，因此需要开发一个适应本土文化的评估框架。

Method: 通过翻译现有数据集（如Anthropic Red Teaming数据）和创建新数据集（如ProhibiBench-fa、SafeBench-fa等），构建了一个统一的波斯语LLM评估框架。

Result: 论文提出了一个公开的排行榜，用于评估波斯语LLM在安全性、公平性和社会规范方面的表现。

Conclusion: 该框架为波斯语LLM的文化适应性评估提供了新方法，并推动了相关领域的研究。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation framework for aligning Persian
Large Language Models (LLMs) with critical ethical dimensions, including
safety, fairness, and social norms. It addresses the gaps in existing LLM
evaluation frameworks by adapting them to Persian linguistic and cultural
contexts. This benchmark creates three types of Persian-language benchmarks:
(i) translated data, (ii) new data generated synthetically, and (iii) new
naturally collected data. We translate Anthropic Red Teaming data, AdvBench,
HarmBench, and DecodingTrust into Persian. Furthermore, we create
ProhibiBench-fa, SafeBench-fa, FairBench-fa, and SocialBench-fa as new datasets
to address harmful and prohibited content in indigenous culture. Moreover, we
collect extensive dataset as GuardBench-fa to consider Persian cultural norms.
By combining these datasets, our work establishes a unified framework for
evaluating Persian LLMs, offering a new approach to culturally grounded
alignment evaluation. A systematic evaluation of Persian LLMs is performed
across the three alignment aspects: safety (avoiding harmful content), fairness
(mitigating biases), and social norms (adhering to culturally accepted
behaviors). We present a publicly available leaderboard that benchmarks Persian
LLMs with respect to safety, fairness, and social norms at:

TL;DR: CDF-RAG框架通过动态反馈和因果图检索增强RAG，提升生成推理的因果一致性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG框架依赖语义相似性检索，难以区分真实因果关系与虚假关联，导致生成内容可能不完整或误导。

Method: CDF-RAG通过迭代查询优化、结构化因果图检索和多跳因果推理，结合因果路径验证生成内容。

Result: 在四个数据集上验证，CDF-RAG显著提升了响应准确性和因果正确性。

Conclusion: CDF-RAG为知识密集型任务提供了更可靠、可解释的生成推理框架。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly enhanced large
language models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive tasks by incorporating external
knowledge retrieval. However, existing RAG frameworks primarily rely on
semantic similarity and correlation-driven retrieval, limiting their ability to
distinguish true causal relationships from spurious associations. This results
in responses that may be factually grounded but fail to establish
cause-and-effect mechanisms, leading to incomplete or misleading insights. To
address this issue, we introduce Causal Dynamic Feedback for Adaptive
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CDF-RAG), a framework designed to improve
causal consistency, factual accuracy, and explainability in generative
reasoning. CDF-RAG iteratively refines queries, retrieves structured causal
graphs, and enables multi-hop causal reasoning across interconnected knowledge
sources. Additionally, it validates responses against causal pathways, ensuring
logically coherent and factually grounded outputs. We evaluate CDF-RAG on four
diverse datasets, demonstrating its ability to improve response accuracy and
causal correctness over existing RAG-based methods. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/ elakhatibi/CDF-RAG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成数据多样性不足，限制了其在特定领域适配中的应用。

Method: 提出MetaSynth方法，利用语言模型协调多个专家LLM代理协作生成数据。

Result: 仅用2500万令牌的合成数据，模型在金融和生物医学领域分别提升4.08%和13.75%。

Conclusion: MetaSynth生成的多样化合成数据能有效支持领域适配，无需混合真实数据。

Abstract: Recent smaller language models such Phi-3.5 and Phi-4 rely on synthetic data
generated using larger Language models. Questions remain about leveraging
synthetic data for other use cases, such as adapting LLMs to specific domains.
A key limitation of synthetic data is low diversity, which negatively impacts
its downstream applicability for improving other models. To address this, we
propose MetaSynth, a method for generating synthetic data that enhances
diversity through meta-prompting, where a language model orchestrates multiple
"expert" LLM agents to collaboratively generate data. Using only 25 million
tokens of synthetic data generated with MetaSynth, we successfully adapt a
well-trained LLM (Mistral-7B-v0.3) to two specialized domains-Finance and
Biomedicine-without compromising the capabilities of the resulting model in
general tasks. In addition, we evaluate the diversity of our synthetic data
using seven automated metrics, and find that it approaches the diversity of LLM
pre-training corpora.
  Continually pre-training Mistral-7B-v0.3 with MetaSynth notably outperforms
the base LLM, showing improvements of up to 4.08% in Finance and 13.75% in
Biomedicine. The same model shows degraded performance when trained on data
generated using a template prompt, even when the template includes prior
generations and varying In-Context exemplars of real data. Our findings suggest
that a few million tokens of diverse synthetic data without mixing any real
data, is sufficient for effective domain adaptation when using MetaSynth.

*Liyi Zhang,Veniamin Veselovsky,R. Thomas McCoy,Thomas L. Griffiths*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大语言模型（LLMs）在某些确定性任务中表现不佳，但通过干预可以改善其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在确定性任务（如计数或缩写）中表现不佳，因为其隐式先验分布影响了响应。研究旨在探索如何通过干预让LLMs更好地利用已有信息。

Method: 通过提示模型不依赖先验知识，并使用机制解释技术定位和操纵先验影响。对特定神经网络层进行轻量级微调。

Result: 干预显著提高了模型在先验主导任务中的表现，微调后错误不再与先验相关。

Conclusion: 研究表明，可以通过操纵LLMs对先验的依赖程度来提高其性能，尤其是在幻觉问题相关的场景中。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) sometimes fail to respond appropriately to
deterministic tasks -- such as counting or forming acronyms -- because the
implicit prior distribution they have learned over sequences of tokens
influences their responses. In this work, we show that, in at least some cases,
LLMs actually compute the information needed to perform these tasks correctly,
and we identify some interventions that can allow them to access this
information to improve their performance. First, we show that simply prompting
the language model to not rely on its prior knowledge leads to dramatic
improvements in prior-dominated tasks. We then use mechanistic interpretability
techniques to localize the prior within the LLM and manipulate the extent to
which that prior influences its responses. Specifically, we show that it is
possible to identify layers of the underlying neural network that correlate
with the prior probability of a response and that lightweight finetuning of
these layers with basic prompts on prior-dominated tasks achieves high
performance on held-out answers. These results suggest that the information
required to produce a correct response is contained within the representations
of the problems formed by the models. Furthermore, we show that this finetuning
is significantly more effective for prior-dominated tasks, and that the error
after finetuning is no longer correlated with the prior. Our results suggest
that it may be possible to define effective methods for manipulating the extent
to which LLMs rely upon their priors in solving problems, potentially
increasing their performance in settings where LLMs hallucinate for reasons
related to the prior probability of token sequences.

TL;DR: GeoSense是一个新的双语基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的几何推理能力，发现现有模型在几何原理识别和应用上存在瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未能全面评估MLLMs在几何问题解决（GPS）中的视觉理解和符号推理能力，因此需要一个新的综合评估工具。

Method: GeoSense采用五级几何原理层次框架，包含1,789个标注问题，并设计了创新的评估策略。

Result: Gemini-2.0-pro-flash表现最佳，总体得分为65.3，但几何原理的识别和应用仍是瓶颈。

Conclusion: GeoSense有助于指导未来MLLMs在几何推理能力上的改进，推动更接近人类水平的AI推理。

Abstract: Geometry problem-solving (GPS), a challenging task requiring both visual
comprehension and symbolic reasoning, effectively measures the reasoning
capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Humans exhibit strong
reasoning ability in this task through accurate identification and adaptive
application of geometric principles within visual contexts. However, existing
benchmarks fail to jointly assess both dimensions of the human-like geometric
reasoning mechanism in MLLMs, remaining a critical gap in assessing their
ability to tackle GPS. To this end, we introduce GeoSense, the first
comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the
geometric reasoning abilities of MLLMs through the lens of geometric
principles. GeoSense features a five-level hierarchical framework of geometric
principles spanning plane and solid geometry, an intricately annotated dataset
of 1,789 problems, and an innovative evaluation strategy. Through extensive
experiments on GeoSense with various open-source and closed-source MLLMs, we
observe that Gemini-2.0-pro-flash performs best, achieving an overall score of
$65.3$. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the identification and application
of geometric principles remain a bottleneck for leading MLLMs, jointly
hindering their reasoning abilities. These findings underscore GeoSense's
potential to guide future advancements in MLLMs' geometric reasoning
capabilities, paving the way for more robust and human-like reasoning in
artificial intelligence.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs是否能捕捉个体层面的主观性，特别是在道德判断任务中。

Method: 提出SOLAR框架，基于用户生成文本中的价值冲突和权衡，推断个体的主观立场。

Result: 实验表明SOLAR提升了推断效果，尤其在争议情境中，并能解释个体的价值偏好。

Conclusion: SOLAR能有效捕捉个体主观性，为道德判断提供解释。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) not only have solved complex reasoning problems
but also exhibit remarkable performance in tasks that require subjective
decision making. Existing studies suggest that LLM generations can be
subjectively grounded to some extent, yet exploring whether LLMs can account
for individual-level subjectivity has not been sufficiently studied. In this
paper, we characterize subjectivity of individuals on social media and infer
their moral judgments using LLMs. We propose a framework, SOLAR (Subjective
Ground with Value Abstraction), that observes value conflicts and trade-offs in
the user-generated texts to better represent subjective ground of individuals.
Empirical results show that our framework improves overall inference results as
well as performance on controversial situations. Additionally, we qualitatively
show that SOLAR provides explanations about individuals' value preferences,
which can further account for their judgments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的后训练合成数据生成策略，用于高效扩展LLMs的上下文窗口，同时保持其通用任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在长上下文推理方面表现不佳，主要由于计算复杂度随序列长度呈二次增长，且长上下文数据的标注稀缺且昂贵。

Method: 采用逐步旋转位置嵌入（RoPE）扩展训练策略，生成合成数据以扩展上下文窗口，不受实际数据长度的限制。

Result: 模型在1M tokens的上下文长度下，在RULER和InfiniteBench基准测试中表现良好，同时保持通用语言任务的稳健性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了长上下文数据稀缺问题，为LLMs的长上下文推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with long-context reasoning, not only
due to the quadratic scaling of computational complexity with sequence length
but also because of the scarcity and expense of annotating long-context data.
There has been barely any open-source work that systematically ablates
long-context data, nor is there any openly available instruction tuning dataset
with contexts surpassing 100K tokens. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel
post-training synthetic data generation strategy designed to efficiently extend
the context window of LLMs while preserving their general task performance. Our
approach scalably extends to arbitrarily long context lengths, unconstrained by
the length of available real-world data, which effectively addresses the
scarcity of raw long-context data. Through a step-by-step rotary position
embedding (RoPE) scaling training strategy, we demonstrate that our model, with
a context length of up to 1M tokens, performs well on the RULER benchmark and
InfiniteBench and maintains robust performance on general language tasks.

Conclusion: Persona-judge为更自适应的定制对齐铺平了道路。

Abstract: Aligning language models with human preferences presents significant
challenges, particularly in achieving personalization without incurring
excessive computational costs. Existing methods rely on reward signals and
additional annotated data, limiting their scalability and adaptability to
diverse human values. To address these challenges, we introduce Persona-judge,
a novel discriminative paradigm that enables training-free personalized
alignment with unseen preferences. Instead of optimizing policy parameters
through external reward feedback, Persona-judge leverages the intrinsic
preference judgment capabilities of the model. Specifically, a draft model
generates candidate tokens conditioned on a given preference, while a judge
model, embodying another preference, cross-validates the predicted tokens
whether to be accepted. Experimental results demonstrate that Persona-judge,
using the inherent preference evaluation mechanisms of the model, offers a
scalable and computationally efficient solution to personalized alignment,
paving the way for more adaptive customized alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索到的文档常包含无关或误导性信息，导致抽象压缩器容易遗漏关键信息，影响答案准确性。

Method: 提出ACoRN方法，包括离线数据增强和针对多文档信息利用的微调，以生成围绕关键信息的摘要。

Result: 实验显示，ACoRN训练的T5-large模型在EM和F1分数上表现更优，且能保留答案字符串作为直接证据。

Conclusion: ACoRN在处理包含大量降低准确性文档的数据集时表现优异，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Abstractive compression utilizes smaller langauge models to condense
query-relevant context, reducing computational costs in retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG). However,retrieved documents often include information that is
either irrelevant to answering the query or misleading due to factual incorrect
content, despite having high relevance scores. This behavior indicates that
abstractive compressors are more likely to omit important information essential
for the correct answer, especially in long contexts where attention dispersion
occurs. To address this issue, we categorize retrieved documents in a more
fine-grained manner and propose Abstractive Compression Robust against Noise
(ACoRN), which introduces two novel training steps. First, we use offline data
augmentation on the training dataset to enhance compressor robustness against
two distinct types of retrieval noise. Second, since the language modelbased
compressor cannot fully utilize information from multiple retrieved documents
and exhibits positional bias, we perform finetuning to generate summaries
centered around key information that directly supports the correct answer. Our
experiments demonstrate that T5-large, trained with ACoRN as a compressor,
improves EM and F1 scores while preserving the answer string, which could serve
as direct evidence. ACoRN excels on datasets with many accuracy-reducing
documents, making it highly useful in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: GRAIL是一种基于梯度的多领域遗忘框架，旨在精确移除敏感信息同时保留关键知识，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型可能学习敏感信息，现有单领域遗忘方法无法处理多领域交织知识的问题。

Method: GRAIL利用多领域梯度信息区分遗忘与保留范围，采用自适应参数定位策略选择性移除目标知识。

Result: GRAIL在遗忘基准测试中表现与现有方法相当，知识保留成功率提升17%。

Conclusion: GRAIL为大规模预训练语言模型中敏感信息管理提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on extensive datasets often learn
sensitive information, which raises significant social and legal concerns under
principles such as the "Right to be forgotten." Retraining entire models from
scratch to remove undesired information is both costly and impractical.
Furthermore, existing single-domain unlearning methods fail to address
multi-domain scenarios, where knowledge is interwoven across domains such as
privacy and copyright, creating overlapping representations that lead to
excessive knowledge removal or degraded performance. To tackle these issues, we
propose GRAIL (GRadient-based AdaptIve unLearning), a novel multi-domain
unlearning framework. GRAIL leverages gradient information from multiple
domains to precisely distinguish the unlearning scope from the retention scope,
and applies an adaptive parameter-wise localization strategy to selectively
remove targeted knowledge while preserving critical parameters for each domain.
Experimental results on unlearning benchmarks show that GRAIL achieves
unlearning success on par with the existing approaches, while also
demonstrating up to 17% stronger knowledge retention success compared to the
previous state-of-art method. Our findings establish a new paradigm for
effectively managing and regulating sensitive information in large-scale
pre-trained language models.

Motivation: 开源与闭源代码生成模型存在性能差距，现有方法通过生成大量合成数据微调，但效率低下。

Result: 在40%数据集上训练，性能提升至66.9%，训练时间减少，GPU内存消耗降低。

Conclusion: 优化数据选择和分词过程可同时提升模型性能和训练效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in code
generation tasks. However, there remains a performance gap between open-source
and closed-source models. To address this gap, existing approaches typically
generate large amounts of synthetic data for fine-tuning, which often leads to
inefficient training. In this work, we propose a data selection strategy in
order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of training for code-based
LLMs. By prioritizing data complexity and ensuring that the sampled subset
aligns with the distribution of the original dataset, our sampling strategy
effectively selects high-quality data. Additionally, we optimize the
tokenization process through a "dynamic pack" technique, which minimizes
padding tokens and reduces computational resource consumption. Experimental
results show that when training on 40% of the OSS-Instruct dataset, the
DeepSeek-Coder-Base-6.7B model achieves an average performance of 66.9%,
surpassing the 66.1% performance with the full dataset. Moreover, training time
is reduced from 47 minutes to 34 minutes, and the peak GPU memory decreases
from 61.47 GB to 42.72 GB during a single epoch. Similar improvements are
observed with the CodeLlama-Python-7B model on the Evol-Instruct dataset. By
optimizing both data selection and tokenization, our approach not only improves
model performance but also improves training efficiency.

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）经常产生幻觉内容（偏离事实或上下文），其成因复杂，诊断困难，因此需要系统化的方法来理解和追踪幻觉。

Method: 提出子序列关联框架，通过分析解码器-仅变换器作为子序列嵌入模型的行为，设计了一种追踪算法，通过随机化输入上下文分析幻觉概率来识别因果子序列。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在识别幻觉成因方面优于标准归因技术，并与模型训练语料库的证据一致。

Conclusion: 该研究为幻觉现象提供了统一的视角和强大的追踪与分析框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinations-content that
deviates from factual accuracy or provided context-posing challenges for
diagnosis due to the complex interplay of underlying causes. This paper
introduces a subsequence association framework to systematically trace and
understand hallucinations. Our key insight is that hallucinations arise when
dominant hallucinatory associations outweigh faithful ones. Through theoretical
and empirical analyses, we demonstrate that decoder-only transformers
effectively function as subsequence embedding models, with linear layers
encoding input-output associations. We propose a tracing algorithm that
identifies causal subsequences by analyzing hallucination probabilities across
randomized input contexts. Experiments show our method outperforms standard
attribution techniques in identifying hallucination causes and aligns with
evidence from the model's training corpus. This work provides a unified
perspective on hallucinations and a robust framework for their tracing and
analysis.

TL;DR: Pandora提出了一种统一的USKR框架，利用Python的Pandas API构建知识表示，并通过LLM生成推理步骤和可执行代码，实现了跨任务知识迁移和性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有USKR方法依赖任务特定策略或自定义表示，难以实现知识迁移或与LLM对齐，限制了性能。

Method: 利用Python的Pandas API构建统一知识表示，通过LLM生成推理步骤和可执行代码，并借助训练示例库促进知识迁移。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，Pandora优于现有统一框架，并与任务特定方法竞争。

Conclusion: Pandora通过统一表示和LLM对齐，显著提升了USKR任务的性能。

Abstract: Unified Structured Knowledge Reasoning (USKR) aims to answer natural language
questions (NLQs) by using structured sources such as tables, databases, and
knowledge graphs in a unified way. Existing USKR methods either rely on
employing task-specific strategies or custom-defined representations, which
struggle to leverage the knowledge transfer between different SKR tasks or
align with the prior of LLMs, thereby limiting their performance. This paper
proposes a novel USKR framework named \textsc{Pandora}, which takes advantage
of \textsc{Python}'s \textsc{Pandas} API to construct a unified knowledge
representation for alignment with LLM pre-training. It employs an LLM to
generate textual reasoning steps and executable Python code for each question.
Demonstrations are drawn from a memory of training examples that cover various
SKR tasks, facilitating knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on four
benchmarks involving three SKR tasks demonstrate that \textsc{Pandora}
outperforms existing unified frameworks and competes effectively with
task-specific methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了语言模型（LMs）对全球范围内被忽视的边缘群体和低资源语言的偏见问题，特别关注了阿拉伯国家、德国、英国和美国的270个边缘群体，并揭示了埃及阿拉伯方言与现代标准阿拉伯语在偏见测量中的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对语言模型偏见的研究主要集中在英语世界，忽视了全球范围内的边缘群体和低资源语言。论文旨在填补这一空白，推动更具包容性的语言模型发展。

Method: 研究了23个语言模型对270个边缘群体的偏见，特别比较了埃及阿拉伯方言和现代标准阿拉伯语在偏见测量中的差异。

Result: 发现语言模型对许多边缘群体的偏见高于主导群体，但阿拉伯语言模型在宗教和种族方面对边缘和主导群体均表现出高偏见。此外，对非二元性别、LGBTQIA+和黑人女性的交叉偏见更高。

Conclusion: 研究表明需要更广泛的偏见研究，涵盖更多边缘群体和低资源语言，以开发更具包容性的语言模型。

Abstract: We know that language models (LMs) form biases and stereotypes of minorities,
leading to unfair treatments of members of these groups, thanks to research
mainly in the US and the broader English-speaking world. As the negative
behavior of these models has severe consequences for society and individuals,
industry and academia are actively developing methods to reduce the bias in
LMs. However, there are many under-represented groups and languages that have
been overlooked so far. This includes marginalized groups that are specific to
individual countries and regions in the English speaking and Western world, but
crucially also almost all marginalized groups in the rest of the world. The UN
estimates, that between 600 million to 1.2 billion people worldwide are members
of marginalized groups and in need for special protection. If we want to
develop inclusive LMs that work for everyone, we have to broaden our
understanding to include overlooked marginalized groups and low-resource
languages and dialects.
  In this work, we contribute to this effort with the first study investigating
offensive stereotyping bias in 23 LMs for 270 marginalized groups from Egypt,
the remaining 21 Arab countries, Germany, the UK, and the US. Additionally, we
investigate the impact of low-resource languages and dialects on the study of
bias in LMs, demonstrating the limitations of current bias metrics, as we
measure significantly higher bias when using the Egyptian Arabic dialect versus
Modern Standard Arabic. Our results show, LMs indeed show higher bias against
many marginalized groups in comparison to dominant groups. However, this is not
the case for Arabic LMs, where the bias is high against both marginalized and
dominant groups in relation to religion and ethnicity.
  Our results also show higher intersectional bias against Non-binary, LGBTQIA+
and Black women.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MLLMs在几何问题解决中缺乏精确逐步推理数据和严重幻觉的问题。

Method: 提出GeoGen管道生成逐步推理路径，并训练GeoLogic模型结合符号系统验证MLLM输出。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著提升MLLMs在几何推理任务中的性能。

Conclusion: 结合LLMs和符号系统的优势，提供更可靠和可解释的几何问题解决方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress in general domains and demonstrated promise in multimodal
mathematical reasoning. However, applying MLLMs to geometry problem solving
(GPS) remains challenging due to lack of accurate step-by-step solution data
and severe hallucinations during reasoning. In this paper, we propose GeoGen, a
pipeline that can automatically generates step-wise reasoning paths for
geometry diagrams. By leveraging the precise symbolic reasoning,
\textbf{GeoGen} produces large-scale, high-quality question-answer pairs. To
further enhance the logical reasoning ability of MLLMs, we train
\textbf{GeoLogic}, a Large Language Model (LLM) using synthetic data generated
by GeoGen. Serving as a bridge between natural language and symbolic systems,
GeoLogic enables symbolic tools to help verifying MLLM outputs, making the
reasoning process more rigorous and alleviating hallucinations. Experimental
results show that our approach consistently improves the performance of MLLMs,
achieving remarkable results on benchmarks for geometric reasoning tasks. This
improvement stems from our integration of the strengths of LLMs and symbolic
systems, which enables a more reliable and interpretable approach for the GPS
task. Codes are available at https://github.com/ycpNotFound/GeoGen.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）在艺术评论和心智理论（ToM）任务中的表现，发现通过精心设计的提示，LLM能生成接近人类水平的评论，并在复杂推理任务中表现不一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在艺术相关任务中的能力，尤其是评论生成和心智推理，以评估其是否能在缺乏真实理解的情况下模拟专家行为。

Method: 结合艺术批评理论构建系统生成评论，并通过逐步提示优化输出；设计新的ToM任务测试LLM在复杂情境中的推理能力。

Result: 人类难以区分AI与专家评论；LLM在ToM任务中表现不一，情感或模糊情境下差异更明显。

Conclusion: LLM在特定指导下能接近人类行为，但其认知局限与潜力并存，提示设计是关键。

Abstract: This study explored how large language models (LLMs) perform in two areas
related to art: writing critiques of artworks and reasoning about mental states
(Theory of Mind, or ToM) in art-related situations. For the critique generation
part, we built a system that combines Noel Carroll's evaluative framework with
a broad selection of art criticism theories. The model was prompted to first
write a full-length critique and then shorter, more coherent versions using a
step-by-step prompting process. These AI-generated critiques were then compared
with those written by human experts in a Turing test-style evaluation. In many
cases, human subjects had difficulty telling which was which, and the results
suggest that LLMs can produce critiques that are not only plausible in style
but also rich in interpretation, as long as they are carefully guided. In the
second part, we introduced new simple ToM tasks based on situations involving
interpretation, emotion, and moral tension, which can appear in the context of
art. These go beyond standard false-belief tests and allow for more complex,
socially embedded forms of reasoning. We tested 41 recent LLMs and found that
their performance varied across tasks and models. In particular, tasks that
involved affective or ambiguous situations tended to reveal clearer
differences. Taken together, these results help clarify how LLMs respond to
complex interpretative challenges, revealing both their cognitive limitations
and potential. While our findings do not directly contradict the so-called
Generative AI Paradox--the idea that LLMs can produce expert-like output
without genuine understanding--they suggest that, depending on how LLMs are
instructed, such as through carefully designed prompts, these models may begin
to show behaviors that resemble understanding more closely than we might
assume.

TL;DR: SMARTe是一种基于槽注意力的关系三元组提取方法，强调可解释性，性能与现有最优模型相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法注重性能优化，但缺乏对模型内部机制的理解，且依赖复杂预处理，导致系统不透明。

Method: 提出SMARTe，通过槽注意力机制将任务转化为集合预测问题，确保预测可追溯。

Result: 在NYT和WebNLG数据集上表现与最优模型相当，且不牺牲性能。

Conclusion: SMARTe在保持性能的同时提供可解释性，未来可进一步研究其应用。

Abstract: Relational Triple Extraction (RTE) is a fundamental task in Natural Language
Processing (NLP). However, prior research has primarily focused on optimizing
model performance, with limited efforts to understand the internal mechanisms
driving these models. Many existing methods rely on complex preprocessing to
induce specific interactions, often resulting in opaque systems that may not
fully align with their theoretical foundations. To address these limitations,
we propose SMARTe: a Slot-based Method for Accountable Relational Triple
extraction. SMARTe introduces intrinsic interpretability through a slot
attention mechanism and frames the task as a set prediction problem. Slot
attention consolidates relevant information into distinct slots, ensuring all
predictions can be explicitly traced to learned slot representations and the
tokens contributing to each predicted relational triple. While emphasizing
interpretability, SMARTe achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art
models. Evaluations on the NYT and WebNLG datasets demonstrate that adding
interpretability does not compromise performance. Furthermore, we conducted
qualitative assessments to showcase the explanations provided by SMARTe, using
attention heatmaps that map to their respective tokens. We conclude with a
discussion of our findings and propose directions for future research.

*Amey Hengle,Prasoon Bajpai,Soham Dan,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLRBench是一个新的多语言长上下文推理基准测试，超越了传统的检索任务，评估多跳推理、聚合和认知推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试过于关注检索能力，忽略了推理能力，且存在数据泄露和短视问题。

Method: 开发MLRBench，包含多语言任务，评估多跳推理、聚合和认知推理，支持任意上下文长度。

Result: 实验显示高低资源语言间存在显著差距，LLMs在多语言环境中仅利用不到30%的上下文长度。

Conclusion: MLRBench为多语言LLMs的评估和训练提供了新工具，开源以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Existing multilingual long-context benchmarks, often based on the popular
needle-in-a-haystack test, primarily evaluate a model's ability to locate
specific information buried within irrelevant texts. However, such a
retrieval-centric approach is myopic and inherently limited, as successful
recall alone does not indicate a model's capacity to reason over extended
contexts. Moreover, these benchmarks are susceptible to data leakage,
short-circuiting, and risk making the evaluation a priori identifiable. To
address these limitations, we introduce MLRBench, a new synthetic benchmark for
multilingual long-context reasoning. Unlike existing benchmarks, MLRBench goes
beyond surface-level retrieval by including tasks that assess multi-hop
inference, aggregation, and epistemic reasoning. Spanning seven languages,
MLRBench is designed to be parallel, resistant to leakage, and scalable to
arbitrary context lengths. Our extensive experiments with an open-weight large
language model (LLM) reveal a pronounced gap between high- and low-resource
languages, particularly for tasks requiring the model to aggregate multiple
facts or predict the absence of information. We also find that, in multilingual
settings, LLMs effectively utilize less than 30% of their claimed context
length. Although off-the-shelf Retrieval Augmented Generation helps alleviate
this to a certain extent, it does not solve the long-context problem. We
open-source MLRBench to enable future research in improved evaluation and
training of multilingual LLMs.

TL;DR: ViClaim是一个多语言、多主题的视频转录数据集，用于检测视频中的误导信息，填补了现有文本检测工具的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频内容作为传播和误导信息的媒介日益重要，但现有工具主要针对文本，缺乏对视频转录复杂性的处理。

Method: 构建ViClaim数据集，包含1,798个标注视频转录，覆盖三种语言和六个主题，使用定制标注工具。实验采用多语言语言模型进行验证。

Result: 模型在交叉验证中表现优异（宏F1达0.896），但对未见主题的泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: ViClaim为视频误导信息检测提供了坚实基础，凸显了视频转录中声明检测的复杂性。

Abstract: The growing influence of video content as a medium for communication and
misinformation underscores the urgent need for effective tools to analyze
claims in multilingual and multi-topic settings. Existing efforts in
misinformation detection largely focus on written text, leaving a significant
gap in addressing the complexity of spoken text in video transcripts. We
introduce ViClaim, a dataset of 1,798 annotated video transcripts across three
languages (English, German, Spanish) and six topics. Each sentence in the
transcripts is labeled with three claim-related categories: fact-check-worthy,
fact-non-check-worthy, or opinion. We developed a custom annotation tool to
facilitate the highly complex annotation process. Experiments with
state-of-the-art multilingual language models demonstrate strong performance in
cross-validation (macro F1 up to 0.896) but reveal challenges in generalization
to unseen topics, particularly for distinct domains. Our findings highlight the
complexity of claim detection in video transcripts. ViClaim offers a robust
foundation for advancing misinformation detection in video-based communication,
addressing a critical gap in multimodal analysis.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced AI agents
as a disruptive paradigm across various industries, yet their application in
machine translation (MT) remains underexplored. This paper describes and
analyses the potential of single- and multi-agent systems for MT, reflecting on
how they could enhance multilingual digital communication. While single-agent
systems are well-suited for simpler translation tasks, multi-agent systems,
which involve multiple specialized AI agents collaborating in a structured
manner, may offer a promising solution for complex scenarios requiring high
accuracy, domain-specific knowledge, and contextual awareness. To demonstrate
the feasibility of multi-agent workflows in MT, we are conducting a pilot study
in legal MT. The study employs a multi-agent system involving four specialized
AI agents for (i) translation, (ii) adequacy review, (iii) fluency review, and
(iv) final editing. Our findings suggest that multi-agent systems may have the
potential to significantly improve domain-adaptability and contextual
awareness, with superior translation quality to traditional MT or single-agent
systems. This paper also sets the stage for future research into multi-agent
applications in MT, integration into professional translation workflows, and
shares a demo of the system analyzed in the paper.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型（LLMs）在推理时可能仍会利用数据集偏差，导致泛化能力不足。传统的基于先验知识或上下文学习的去偏方法效果有限。

Method: 结合因果机制和信息理论，提出信息增益引导的因果干预去偏框架（IGCIDB），通过自动平衡数据集分布并监督微调LLMs。

Result: 实验表明，IGCIDB能有效去偏，提升LLMs在不同任务中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: IGCIDF框架为解决LLMs的偏差问题提供了一种有效方法，显著提升了模型的泛化性能。

Abstract: Despite significant progress, recent studies indicate that current large
language models (LLMs) may still capture dataset biases and utilize them during
inference, leading to the poor generalizability of LLMs. However, due to the
diversity of dataset biases and the insufficient nature of bias suppression
based on in-context learning, the effectiveness of previous prior
knowledge-based debiasing methods and in-context learning based automatic
debiasing methods is limited. To address these challenges, we explore the
combination of causal mechanisms with information theory and propose an
information gain-guided causal intervention debiasing (IGCIDB) framework. This
framework first utilizes an information gain-guided causal intervention method
to automatically and autonomously balance the distribution of
instruction-tuning dataset. Subsequently, it employs a standard supervised
fine-tuning process to train LLMs on the debiased dataset. Experimental results
show that IGCIDB can effectively debias LLM to improve its generalizability
across different tasks.

Result: 实验表明NaVAB能有效识别LLM与目标国家价值观的不一致，并结合对齐技术减少价值冲突。

Conclusion: NaVAB为评估和改善LLM与国家价值观对齐提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Do Large Language Models (LLMs) hold positions that conflict with your
country's values? Occasionally they do! However, existing works primarily focus
on ethical reviews, failing to capture the diversity of national values, which
encompass broader policy, legal, and moral considerations. Furthermore, current
benchmarks that rely on spectrum tests using manually designed questionnaires
are not easily scalable.
  To address these limitations, we introduce NaVAB, a comprehensive benchmark
to evaluate the alignment of LLMs with the values of five major nations: China,
the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. NaVAB implements a
national value extraction pipeline to efficiently construct value assessment
datasets. Specifically, we propose a modeling procedure with instruction
tagging to process raw data sources, a screening process to filter
value-related topics and a generation process with a Conflict Reduction
mechanism to filter non-conflicting values.We conduct extensive experiments on
various LLMs across countries, and the results provide insights into assisting
in the identification of misaligned scenarios. Moreover, we demonstrate that
NaVAB can be combined with alignment techniques to effectively reduce value
concerns by aligning LLMs' values with the target country.

Result: 实验显示，基于MAIN微调的LLaMA和Mistral模型在多个基准测试中表现更优。

Conclusion: 指令与响应的对齐对高质量指令调优具有关键作用，MAIN框架为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Instruction tuning has enabled large language models (LLMs) to achieve
remarkable performance, but its success heavily depends on the availability of
large-scale, high-quality instruction-response pairs. However, current methods
for scaling up data generation often overlook a crucial aspect: the alignment
between instructions and responses. We hypothesize that high-quality
instruction-response pairs are not defined by the individual quality of each
component, but by the extent of their alignment with each other. To address
this, we propose a Mutual Alignment Framework (MAIN) that ensures coherence
between the instruction and response through mutual constraints. Experiments
demonstrate that models such as LLaMA and Mistral, fine-tuned within this
framework, outperform traditional methods across multiple benchmarks. This
approach underscores the critical role of instruction-response alignment in
enabling scalable and high-quality instruction tuning for LLMs.

of using prompts within these models for unsupervised concept extraction. The
extracted concepts are intended to support domain coverage evaluation of

Conclusion: 论文挑战了复杂推理策略必然更优的假设，表明简单方法也能实现最佳效果，为高效推理框架设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed the
development of general-purpose autonomous agents, demonstrating remarkable
performance in complex reasoning tasks across various domains. This surge has
spurred the evolution of a plethora of prompt-based reasoning frameworks. A
recent focus has been on iterative reasoning strategies that refine outputs
through self-evaluation and verbalized feedback. However, these strategies
require additional computational complexity to enable models to recognize and
correct their mistakes, leading to a significant increase in their cost. In
this work, we introduce the concept of ``retrials without feedback'', an
embarrassingly simple yet powerful mechanism for enhancing reasoning frameworks
by allowing LLMs to retry problem-solving attempts upon identifying incorrect
answers. Unlike conventional iterative refinement methods, our method does not
require explicit self-reflection or verbalized feedback, simplifying the
refinement process. Our findings indicate that simpler retrial-based approaches
often outperform more sophisticated reasoning frameworks, suggesting that the
benefits of complex methods may not always justify their computational costs.
By challenging the prevailing assumption that more intricate reasoning
strategies inherently lead to better performance, our work offers new insights
into how simpler, more efficient approaches can achieve optimal results. So,
are retrials all you need?

Abstract: Recent advances in long-context reasoning abilities of language models led to
interesting applications in large-scale multi-document summarization. However,
prior work has shown that these long-context models are not effective at their
claimed context windows. To this end, retrieval-augmented systems provide an
efficient and effective alternative. However, their performance can be highly
sensitive to the choice of retrieval context length. In this work, we present a
hybrid method that combines retrieval-augmented systems with long-context
windows supported by recent language models. Our method first estimates the
optimal retrieval length as a function of the retriever, summarizer, and
dataset. On a randomly sampled subset of the dataset, we use a panel of LLMs to
generate a pool of silver references. We use these silver references to
estimate the optimal context length for a given RAG system configuration. Our
results on the multi-document summarization task showcase the effectiveness of
our method across model classes and sizes. We compare against length estimates
from strong long-context benchmarks such as RULER and HELMET. Our analysis also
highlights the effectiveness of our estimation method for very long-context LMs
and its generalization to new classes of LMs.

Motivation: 当前基础模型在生成新颖且可行的科学假设方面存在不足，缺乏专门的数据集。

Method: 提出HypoGen数据集（5500个结构化问题-假设对），采用Bit-Flip-Spark结构和Chain-of-Reasoning组件，将假设生成建模为条件语言生成任务。

Result: 实验表明，基于HypoGen微调的模型在假设的新颖性、可行性和整体质量上均有提升。

Conclusion: HypoGen数据集为科学假设生成提供了有效工具，提升了语言模型在此任务上的表现。

Abstract: Generating novel and creative scientific hypotheses is a cornerstone in
achieving Artificial General Intelligence. Large language and reasoning models
have the potential to aid in the systematic creation, selection, and validation
of scientifically informed hypotheses. However, current foundation models often
struggle to produce scientific ideas that are both novel and feasible. One
reason is the lack of a dedicated dataset that frames Scientific Hypothesis
Generation (SHG) as a Natural Language Generation (NLG) task. In this paper, we
introduce HypoGen, the first dataset of approximately 5500 structured
problem-hypothesis pairs extracted from top-tier computer science conferences
structured with a Bit-Flip-Spark schema, where the Bit is the conventional
assumption, the Spark is the key insight or conceptual leap, and the Flip is
the resulting counterproposal. HypoGen uniquely integrates an explicit
Chain-of-Reasoning component that reflects the intellectual process from Bit to
Flip. We demonstrate that framing hypothesis generation as conditional language
modelling, with the model fine-tuned on Bit-Flip-Spark and the
Chain-of-Reasoning (and where, at inference, we only provide the Bit), leads to
improvements in the overall quality of the hypotheses. Our evaluation employs
automated metrics and LLM judge rankings for overall quality assessment. We
show that by fine-tuning on our HypoGen dataset we improve the novelty,
feasibility, and overall quality of the generated hypotheses. The HypoGen
dataset is publicly available at
huggingface.co/datasets/UniverseTBD/hypogen-dr1.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在内部记忆与外部检索信息间存在知识冲突，影响响应可靠性。

Method: 基于信息论分析LLMs的知识冲突行为，提出Swin-VIB框架，整合变分信息瓶颈模型。

Result: 实验表明Swin-VIB在单选择任务中准确率提升至少7.54%。

Conclusion: Swin-VIB有效解决LLMs的知识冲突问题，提升响应生成质量。

Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
information retrieval systems, particularly in response generation (RG).
Unfortunately, LLMs often face knowledge conflicts between internal memory and
retrievaled external information, arising from misinformation, biases, or
outdated knowledge. These conflicts undermine response reliability and
introduce uncertainty in decision-making. In this work, we analyze how LLMs
navigate knowledge conflicts from an information-theoretic perspective and
reveal that when conflicting and supplementary information exhibit significant
differences, LLMs confidently resolve their preferences. However, when the
distinction is ambiguous, LLMs experience heightened uncertainty. Based on this
insight, we propose Swin-VIB, a novel framework that integrates a pipeline of
variational information bottleneck models into adaptive augmentation of
retrieved information and guiding LLM preference in response generation.
Extensive experiments on single-choice, open-ended question-answering (QA), and
retrieval augmented generation (RAG) validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate the efficacy of Swin-VIB. Notably, our method improves
single-choice task accuracy by at least 7.54\% over competitive baselines.

Motivation: 大语言模型在训练中容易记忆敏感信息，现有遗忘方法难以选择性移除数据关联而不影响整体能力。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：因果中介分析定位关键层（0-5层），并通过约束优化和联合损失函数对下层进行定向遗忘。

Result: 在SemEval-2025任务4中取得第二名，保持88%的基线MMLU准确率。

Conclusion: 因果导向的分层优化为高效精确的LLM遗忘提供了新范式，有助于解决AI数据隐私问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently memorize sensitive information during
training, posing risks when deploying publicly accessible models. Current
machine unlearning methods struggle to selectively remove specific data
associations without degrading overall model capabilities. This paper presents
our solution to SemEval-2025 Task 4 on targeted unlearning, which introduces a
two-stage methodology that combines causal mediation analysis with
layer-specific optimization. Through systematic causal tracing experiments on
OLMo architectures (1B and 7B parameters), we identify the critical role of the
first few transformer layers (layers 0-5) in storing subject-attribute
associations within MLP modules. Building on this insight, we develop a
constrained optimization approach that freezes upper layers while applying a
novel joint loss function to lower layers-simultaneously maximizing forget set
loss via output token cross-entropy penalties and minimizing retain set
deviation through adaptive regularization. Our method achieves 2nd place in the
1B model track, demonstrating strong task performance while maintaining 88% of
baseline MMLU accuracy. These results establish causal-informed layer
optimization as a promising paradigm for efficient, precise unlearning in LLMs,
offering a significant step forward in addressing data privacy concerns in AI
systems.

Abstract: Recent studies have made significant progress in developing large language
models (LLMs) in the medical domain, which can answer expert-level questions
and demonstrate the potential to assist clinicians in real-world clinical
scenarios. Studies have also witnessed the importance of integrating various
modalities with the existing LLMs for a better understanding of complex
clinical contexts, which are innately multi-faceted by nature. Although studies
have demonstrated the ability of multimodal LLMs in histopathology to answer
questions from given images, they lack in understanding of thorough clinical
context due to the patch-level data with limited information from public
datasets. Thus, developing WSI-level MLLMs is significant in terms of the
scalability and applicability of MLLMs in histopathology. In this study, we
introduce an expert-level MLLM for histopathology using WSIs, dubbed as
ChatEXAONEPath. We present a retrieval-based data generation pipeline using
10,094 pairs of WSIs and histopathology reports from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA). We also showcase an AI-based evaluation protocol for a comprehensive
understanding of the medical context from given multimodal information and
evaluate generated answers compared to the original histopathology reports. We
demonstrate the ability of diagnosing the given histopathology images using
ChatEXAONEPath with the acceptance rate of 62.9% from 1,134 pairs of WSIs and
reports. Our proposed model can understand pan-cancer WSIs and clinical context
from various cancer types. We argue that our proposed model has the potential
to assist clinicians by comprehensively understanding complex morphology of
WSIs for cancer diagnosis through the integration of multiple modalities.

Result: 在基准数据集上验证，框架性能优越且有效缓解标记限制问题。

Conclusion: 该框架为基于方面的摘要任务提供了高效解决方案，兼具性能与实用性。

Abstract: Aspect-based summarization aims to generate summaries tailored to specific
aspects, addressing the resource constraints and limited generalizability of
traditional summarization approaches. Recently, large language models have
shown promise in this task without the need for training. However, they rely
excessively on prompt engineering and face token limits and hallucination
challenges, especially with in-context learning. To address these challenges,
in this paper, we propose a novel framework for aspect-based summarization:
Self-Aspect Retrieval Enhanced Summary Generation. Rather than relying solely
on in-context learning, given an aspect, we employ an embedding-driven
retrieval mechanism to identify its relevant text segments. This approach
extracts the pertinent content while avoiding unnecessary details, thereby
mitigating the challenge of token limits. Moreover, our framework optimizes
token usage by deleting unrelated parts of the text and ensuring that the model
generates output strictly based on the given aspect. With extensive experiments
on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our framework not only achieves
superior performance but also effectively mitigates the token limitation
problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨深度学习模型准确性与专家一致性之间的关系，以评估模型在安全关键NLP应用中的适用性。

Method: 评估五种DL模型和四种LLM，使用专家标注数据和文本分析，采用Cohen's Kappa、PCA和SHAP技术量化模型与专家的一致性。

Result: 技术准确性高的模型与专家一致性较低，而LLM更符合专家判断，依赖上下文和时间语言线索而非特定关键词。

Conclusion: 仅准确性不足以评估安全关键NLP模型，建议将专家一致性作为补充指标，并认为LLM在可解释性和扩展性方面具有潜力。

Abstract: This study explores the relationship between deep learning (DL) model
accuracy and expert agreement in the classification of crash narratives. We
evaluate five DL models -- including BERT variants, the Universal Sentence
Encoder (USE), and a zero-shot classifier -- against expert-labeled data and
narrative text. The analysis is further extended to four large language models
(LLMs): GPT-4, LLaMA 3, Qwen, and Claude. Our results reveal a counterintuitive
trend: models with higher technical accuracy often exhibit lower agreement with
domain experts, whereas LLMs demonstrate greater expert alignment despite
relatively lower accuracy scores. To quantify and interpret model-expert
agreement, we employ Cohen's Kappa, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and
SHAP-based explainability techniques. Findings indicate that expert-aligned
models tend to rely more on contextual and temporal language cues, rather than
location-specific keywords. These results underscore that accuracy alone is
insufficient for evaluating models in safety-critical NLP applications. We
advocate for incorporating expert agreement as a complementary metric in model
evaluation frameworks and highlight the promise of LLMs as interpretable,
scalable tools for crash analysis pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统在处理模糊查询、冲突信息和噪声时通常孤立解决单一问题，无法全面应对复杂场景。

Method: 提出RAMDocs数据集模拟复杂冲突场景，并设计MADAM-RAG多代理方法，通过代理辩论和聚合器整合答案。

Result: MADAM-RAG在AmbigDocs和FaithEval上分别提升11.40%和15.80%的性能，但RAMDocs对现有基线仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: MADAM-RAG初步解决了多源冲突问题，但在证据不平衡时仍存在较大改进空间。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly employing
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve the factuality of their
responses. However, in practice, these systems often need to handle ambiguous
user queries and potentially conflicting information from multiple sources
while also suppressing inaccurate information from noisy or irrelevant
documents. Prior work has generally studied and addressed these challenges in
isolation, considering only one aspect at a time, such as handling ambiguity or
robustness to noise and misinformation. We instead consider multiple factors
simultaneously, proposing (i) RAMDocs (Retrieval with Ambiguity and
Misinformation in Documents), a new dataset that simulates complex and
realistic scenarios for conflicting evidence for a user query, including
ambiguity, misinformation, and noise; and (ii) MADAM-RAG, a multi-agent
approach in which LLM agents debate over the merits of an answer over multiple
rounds, allowing an aggregator to collate responses corresponding to
disambiguated entities while discarding misinformation and noise, thereby
handling diverse sources of conflict jointly. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of MADAM-RAG using both closed and open-source models on AmbigDocs -- which
requires presenting all valid answers for ambiguous queries -- improving over
strong RAG baselines by up to 11.40% and on FaithEval -- which requires
suppressing misinformation -- where we improve by up to 15.80% (absolute) with
Llama3.3-70B-Instruct. Furthermore, we find that RAMDocs poses a challenge for
existing RAG baselines (Llama3.3-70B-Instruct only obtains 32.60 exact match
score). While MADAM-RAG begins to address these conflicting factors, our
analysis indicates that a substantial gap remains especially when increasing
the level of imbalance in supporting evidence and misinformation.

Conclusion: EBRM是一种可扩展且高效的方法，能有效增强现有奖励模型和对齐流程。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are essential for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs)
with human preferences. However, they often struggle with capturing complex
human preferences and generalizing to unseen data. To address these challenges,
we introduce Energy-Based Reward Model (EBRM), a lightweight post-hoc
refinement framework that enhances RM robustness and generalization. EBRM
models the reward distribution explicitly, capturing uncertainty in human
preferences and mitigating the impact of noisy or misaligned annotations. It
achieves this through conflict-aware data filtering, label-noise-aware
contrastive training, and hybrid initialization. Notably, EBRM enhances RMs
without retraining, making it computationally efficient and adaptable across
different models and tasks. Empirical evaluations on RM benchmarks demonstrate
significant improvements in both robustness and generalization, achieving up to
a 5.97% improvement in safety-critical alignment tasks compared to standard
RMs. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments confirm that our refined
rewards enhance alignment quality, effectively delaying reward hacking. These
results demonstrate our approach as a scalable and effective enhancement for
existing RMs and alignment pipelines. The code is available at EBRM.

Conclusion: 该方法通过更好地逼近后验分布提升性能，并与现有框架集成，为用户提供简单可编程的解决方案。

Abstract: A wide range of LM applications require generating text that conforms to
syntactic or semantic constraints. Imposing such constraints can be naturally
framed as probabilistic conditioning, but exact generation from the resulting
distribution -- which can differ substantially from the LM's base distribution
-- is generally intractable. In this work, we develop an architecture for
controlled LM generation based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). Our SMC
framework allows us to flexibly incorporate domain- and problem-specific
constraints at inference time, and efficiently reallocate computational
resources in light of new information during the course of generation. By
comparing to a number of alternatives and ablations on four challenging domains
-- Python code generation for data science, text-to-SQL, goal inference, and
molecule synthesis -- we demonstrate that, with little overhead, our approach
allows small open-source language models to outperform models over 8x larger,
as well as closed-source, fine-tuned ones. In support of the probabilistic
perspective, we show that these performance improvements are driven by better
approximation to the posterior distribution. Our system builds on the framework
of Lew et al. (2023) and integrates with its language model probabilistic
programming language, giving users a simple, programmable way to apply SMC to a
broad variety of controlled generation problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练数据集通常缺乏明确的领域划分，手动标注成本高，因此需要一种自动化方法优化数据混合。

Method: CLIMB通过语义嵌入和聚类大规模数据集，利用代理模型和预测器迭代搜索最优数据混合。

Result: 在400B tokens上训练的1B模型性能超越Llama-3.2-1B 2.0%，特定领域优化提升5%。

Conclusion: CLIMB框架和ClimbMix数据集为预训练数据混合优化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-training datasets are typically collected from web content and lack
inherent domain divisions. For instance, widely used datasets like Common Crawl
do not include explicit domain labels, while manually curating labeled datasets
such as The Pile is labor-intensive. Consequently, identifying an optimal
pre-training data mixture remains a challenging problem, despite its
significant benefits for pre-training performance. To address these challenges,
we propose CLustering-based Iterative Data Mixture Bootstrapping (CLIMB), an
automated framework that discovers, evaluates, and refines data mixtures in a
pre-training setting. Specifically, CLIMB embeds and clusters large-scale
datasets in a semantic space and then iteratively searches for optimal mixtures
using a smaller proxy model and a predictor. When continuously trained on 400B
tokens with this mixture, our 1B model exceeds the state-of-the-art
Llama-3.2-1B by 2.0%. Moreover, we observe that optimizing for a specific
domain (e.g., Social Sciences) yields a 5% improvement over random sampling.
Finally, we introduce ClimbLab, a filtered 1.2-trillion-token corpus with 20
clusters as a research playground, and ClimbMix, a compact yet powerful
400-billion-token dataset designed for efficient pre-training that delivers
superior performance under an equal token budget. We analyze the final data
mixture, elucidating the characteristics of an optimal data mixture. Our data

Result: 实验证明DMM能有效整合多个教师模型的知识，实现可控的任意风格生成。

Conclusion: DMM为多模型合并提供了一种高效且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: The success of text-to-image (T2I) generation models has spurred a
proliferation of numerous model checkpoints fine-tuned from the same base model
on various specialized datasets. This overwhelming specialized model production
introduces new challenges for high parameter redundancy and huge storage cost,
thereby necessitating the development of effective methods to consolidate and
unify the capabilities of diverse powerful models into a single one. A common
practice in model merging adopts static linear interpolation in the parameter
space to achieve the goal of style mixing. However, it neglects the features of
T2I generation task that numerous distinct models cover sundry styles which may
lead to incompatibility and confusion in the merged model. To address this
issue, we introduce a style-promptable image generation pipeline which can
accurately generate arbitrary-style images under the control of style vectors.
Based on this design, we propose the score distillation based model merging
paradigm (DMM), compressing multiple models into a single versatile T2I model.
Moreover, we rethink and reformulate the model merging task in the context of
T2I generation, by presenting new merging goals and evaluation protocols. Our
experiments demonstrate that DMM can compactly reorganize the knowledge from
multiple teacher models and achieve controllable arbitrary-style generation.

Result: 实验表明，整合地理空间信息显著提升分类性能，尤其是同时利用细粒度和粗粒度信息时效果最佳。

Conclusion: BRIDGE-LC通过地理空间信息的整合，有效提升了土地覆盖分类的准确性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Land use and land cover mapping from Earth Observation (EO) data is a
critical tool for sustainable land and resource management. While advanced
machine learning and deep learning algorithms excel at analyzing EO imagery
data, they often overlook crucial geospatial metadata information that could
enhance scalability and accuracy across regional, continental, and global
scales. To address this limitation, we propose BRIDGE-LC (Bi-level
Representation Integration for Disentangled GEospatial Land Cover), a novel
deep learning framework that integrates multi-scale geospatial information into
the land cover classification process. By simultaneously leveraging
fine-grained (latitude/longitude) and coarse-grained (biogeographical region)
spatial information, our lightweight multi-layer perceptron architecture learns
from both during training but only requires fine-grained information for
inference, allowing it to disentangle region-specific from region-agnostic land
cover features while maintaining computational efficiency. To assess the
quality of our framework, we use an open-access in-situ dataset and adopt
several competing classification approaches commonly considered for large-scale
land cover mapping. We evaluated all approaches through two scenarios: an
extrapolation scenario in which training data encompasses samples from all
biogeographical regions, and a leave-one-region-out scenario where one region
is excluded from training. We also explore the spatial representation learned
by our model, highlighting a connection between its internal manifold and the
geographical information used during training. Our results demonstrate that
integrating geospatial information improves land cover mapping performance,
with the most substantial gains achieved by jointly leveraging both fine- and
coarse-grained spatial information.

Result: 实验验证了WorldMem在虚拟和真实场景中有效重建场景并捕捉动态演化。

Conclusion: WorldMem通过记忆机制和动态建模，显著提升了世界模拟的长期一致性和交互能力。

Abstract: World simulation has gained increasing popularity due to its ability to model
virtual environments and predict the consequences of actions. However, the
limited temporal context window often leads to failures in maintaining
long-term consistency, particularly in preserving 3D spatial consistency. In
this work, we present WorldMem, a framework that enhances scene generation with
a memory bank consisting of memory units that store memory frames and states
(e.g., poses and timestamps). By employing a memory attention mechanism that
effectively extracts relevant information from these memory frames based on
their states, our method is capable of accurately reconstructing previously
observed scenes, even under significant viewpoint or temporal gaps.
Furthermore, by incorporating timestamps into the states, our framework not
only models a static world but also captures its dynamic evolution over time,
enabling both perception and interaction within the simulated world. Extensive
experiments in both virtual and real scenarios validate the effectiveness of
our approach.

Conclusion: InstantCharacter通过创新的框架和数据集，显著提升了字符定制的能力，同时保持了高保真和文本可控性。

Abstract: Current learning-based subject customization approaches, predominantly
relying on U-Net architectures, suffer from limited generalization ability and
compromised image quality. Meanwhile, optimization-based methods require
subject-specific fine-tuning, which inevitably degrades textual
controllability. To address these challenges, we propose InstantCharacter, a
scalable framework for character customization built upon a foundation
diffusion transformer. InstantCharacter demonstrates three fundamental
advantages: first, it achieves open-domain personalization across diverse
character appearances, poses, and styles while maintaining high-fidelity
results. Second, the framework introduces a scalable adapter with stacked
transformer encoders, which effectively processes open-domain character
features and seamlessly interacts with the latent space of modern diffusion
transformers. Third, to effectively train the framework, we construct a
large-scale character dataset containing 10-million-level samples. The dataset
is systematically organized into paired (multi-view character) and unpaired
(text-image combinations) subsets. This dual-data structure enables
simultaneous optimization of identity consistency and textual editability
through distinct learning pathways. Qualitative experiments demonstrate the
advanced capabilities of InstantCharacter in generating high-fidelity,
text-controllable, and character-consistent images, setting a new benchmark for
character-driven image generation. Our source code is available at

Motivation: 解决VLMs在少样本领域适应中的过拟合和计算限制问题，现有方法如低秩重参数化泛化能力不足且需大量调参。

Method: 采用局部稀疏全局密度和局部随机全局重要性两种范式，动态调整少量参数以减少过拟合。

Result: 在11个数据集上的实验表明，SO在少样本适应中表现优异且降低了内存开销。

Conclusion: SO框架通过高稀疏性动态调整参数，显著提升了少样本领域适应的性能。

Abstract: Adapting Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to new domains with few labeled
samples remains a significant challenge due to severe overfitting and
computational constraints. State-of-the-art solutions, such as low-rank
reparameterization, mitigate these issues but often struggle with
generalization and require extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, a
novel Sparse Optimization (SO) framework is proposed. Unlike low-rank
approaches that typically constrain updates to a fixed subspace, our SO method
leverages high sparsity to dynamically adjust very few parameters. We introduce
two key paradigms. First, we advocate for \textit{local sparsity and global
density}, which updates a minimal subset of parameters per iteration while
maintaining overall model expressiveness. As a second paradigm, we advocate for
\textit{local randomness and global importance}, which sparsifies the gradient
using random selection while pruning the first moment based on importance. This
combination significantly mitigates overfitting and ensures stable adaptation
in low-data regimes. Extensive experiments on 11 diverse datasets show that SO
achieves state-of-the-art few-shot adaptation performance while reducing memory
overhead.

Motivation: 解决现有零样本3D点云分割方法在类别迁移和语义-视觉空间对齐上的局限性。

Method: 引入几何原型（LGPs）和自一致性损失，通过跨注意力机制和共享空间表示增强特征生成与对齐。

Result: 在ScanNet、SemanticKITTI和S3DIS数据集上表现优于四个基线方法，谐波mIoU更高。

Conclusion: 3D-PointZshotS通过几何感知和特征对齐显著提升了零样本分割的泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing zero-shot 3D point cloud segmentation methods often struggle with
limited transferability from seen classes to unseen classes and from semantic
to visual space. To alleviate this, we introduce 3D-PointZshotS, a
geometry-aware zero-shot segmentation framework that enhances both feature
generation and alignment using latent geometric prototypes (LGPs).
Specifically, we integrate LGPs into a generator via a cross-attention
mechanism, enriching semantic features with fine-grained geometric details. To
further enhance stability and generalization, we introduce a self-consistency
loss, which enforces feature robustness against point-wise perturbations.
Additionally, we re-represent visual and semantic features in a shared space,
bridging the semantic-visual gap and facilitating knowledge transfer to unseen
classes. Experiments on three real-world datasets, namely ScanNet,
SemanticKITTI, and S3DIS, demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance over four baselines in terms of harmonic mIoU. The code is

Motivation: 由于LiDAR数据标注成本高，而CAD模型生成的点云数据与真实数据存在域偏移，需开发能跨域泛化的方法。

Method: 使用多视角2D投影缓解点云缺失问题，结合卷积模型提取特征。

Result: 在PointDA-10和Sim-to-Real基准测试中表现优于基线，并能从合成域迁移到真实域。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了3D点云域泛化问题，尤其在点云缺失情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved significant success in 3D point cloud
classification while relying on large-scale, annotated point cloud datasets,
which are labor-intensive to build. Compared to capturing data with LiDAR
sensors and then performing annotation, it is relatively easier to sample point
clouds from CAD models. Yet, data sampled from CAD models is regular, and does
not suffer from occlusion and missing points, which are very common for LiDAR
data, creating a large domain shift. Therefore, it is critical to develop
methods that can generalize well across different point cloud domains. %In this
paper, we focus on the 3D point cloud domain generalization problem. Existing
3D domain generalization methods employ point-based backbones to extract point
cloud features. Yet, by analyzing point utilization of point-based methods and
observing the geometry of point clouds from different domains, we have found
that a large number of point features are discarded by point-based methods
through the max-pooling operation. This is a significant waste especially
considering the fact that domain generalization is more challenging than
supervised learning, and point clouds are already affected by missing points
and occlusion to begin with. To address these issues, we propose a novel method
for 3D point cloud domain generalization, which can generalize to unseen
domains of point clouds. Our proposed method employs multiple 2D projections of
a 3D point cloud to alleviate the issue of missing points and involves a simple
yet effective convolution-based model to extract features. The experiments,
performed on the PointDA-10 and Sim-to-Real benchmarks, demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method, which outperforms different baselines,
and can transfer well from synthetic domain to real-world domain.

Motivation: 解决现有视频编码器在边缘设备上计算需求高且仅能处理短视频的问题。

Method: 采用自适应Transformer块和轻量级分层网络，动态调整隐藏嵌入维度和处理长视频。

Result: 在短视频基准测试中，AdaVid-EgoVLP性能与标准EgoVLP相当，计算量减半；在长视频任务中，平衡计算效率和准确性。

Conclusion: AdaVid在计算效率和性能之间取得了良好平衡，适用于资源受限的设备。

Abstract: Contrastive video-language pretraining has demonstrated great success in
learning rich and robust video representations. However, deploying such video
encoders on compute-constrained edge devices remains challenging due to their
high computational demands. Additionally, existing models are typically trained
to process only short video clips, often limited to 4 to 64 frames. In this
paper, we introduce AdaVid, a flexible architectural framework designed to
learn efficient video encoders that can dynamically adapt their computational
footprint based on available resources. At the heart of AdaVid is an adaptive
transformer block, inspired by Matryoshka Representation Learning, which allows
the model to adjust its hidden embedding dimension at inference time. We show
that AdaVid-EgoVLP, trained on video-narration pairs from the large-scale Ego4D
dataset, matches the performance of the standard EgoVLP on short video-language
benchmarks using only half the compute, and even outperforms EgoVLP when given
equal computational resources. We further explore the trade-off between frame
count and compute on the challenging Diving48 classification benchmark, showing
that AdaVid enables the use of more frames without exceeding computational
limits. To handle longer videos, we also propose a lightweight hierarchical
network that aggregates short clip features, achieving a strong balance between
compute efficiency and accuracy across several long video benchmarks.

Motivation: 事件相机在深度学习中的广泛应用受到高质量标记数据稀缺的限制，现有模拟数据难以准确反映真实事件相机数据。

Method: 利用RVT架构的激活特征，提出事件质量评分（EQS）作为模拟数据的质量指标。

Result: 在DSEC驾驶数据集上的实验表明，更高的EQS能提升模型在真实数据上的泛化能力。

Conclusion: EQS为开发更真实的事件相机模拟器提供了有效工具，有助于减少模拟与真实数据的差距。

Abstract: Event cameras promise a paradigm shift in vision sensing with their low
latency, high dynamic range, and asynchronous nature of events. Unfortunately,
the scarcity of high-quality labeled datasets hinders their widespread adoption
in deep learning-driven computer vision. To mitigate this, several simulators
have been proposed to generate synthetic event data for training models for
detection and estimation tasks. However, the fundamentally different sensor
design of event cameras compared to traditional frame-based cameras poses a
challenge for accurate simulation. As a result, most simulated data fail to
mimic data captured by real event cameras. Inspired by existing work on using
deep features for image comparison, we introduce event quality score (EQS), a
quality metric that utilizes activations of the RVT architecture. Through
sim-to-real experiments on the DSEC driving dataset, it is shown that a higher
EQS implies improved generalization to real-world data after training on
simulated events. Thus, optimizing for EQS can lead to developing more
realistic event camera simulators, effectively reducing the simulation gap. EQS
is available at https://github.com/eventbasedvision/EQS.

Conclusion: 该系统有望将超声诊断扩展到医院外，目前正在进行临床试验并在Butterfly iQ应用中提供。

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging of the heart (echocardiography) is widely used to diagnose
cardiac diseases. However, obtaining an echocardiogram requires an expert
sonographer and a high-quality ultrasound imaging device, which are generally
only available in hospitals. Recently, AI-based navigation models and
algorithms have been used to aid novice sonographers in acquiring the
standardized cardiac views necessary to visualize potential disease
pathologies. These navigation systems typically rely on directional guidance to
predict the necessary rotation of the ultrasound probe. This paper demonstrates
a novel AI navigation system that builds on a decision model for identifying
the inferior vena cava (IVC) of the heart. The decision model is trained
offline using cardiac ultrasound videos and employs binary classification to
determine whether the IVC is present in a given ultrasound video. The
underlying model integrates a novel localization algorithm that leverages the
learned feature representations to annotate the spatial location of the IVC in
real-time. Our model demonstrates strong localization performance on
traditional high-quality hospital ultrasound videos, as well as impressive
zero-shot performance on lower-quality ultrasound videos from a more affordable
Butterfly iQ handheld ultrasound machine. This capability facilitates the
expansion of ultrasound diagnostics beyond hospital settings. Currently, the
guidance system is undergoing clinical trials and is available on the Butterfly
iQ app.

Conclusion: 该研究首次提出了一种仅需标准RGB图像的通用碎片分割模型，适用于大规模灾害后评估和恢复规划。

Abstract: Timely and accurate detection of hurricane debris is critical for effective
disaster response and community resilience. While post-disaster aerial imagery
is readily available, robust debris segmentation solutions applicable across
multiple disaster regions remain limited. Developing a generalized solution is
challenging due to varying environmental and imaging conditions that alter
debris' visual signatures across different regions, further compounded by the
scarcity of training data. This study addresses these challenges by fine-tuning
pre-trained foundational vision models, achieving robust performance with a
relatively small, high-quality dataset. Specifically, this work introduces an
open-source dataset comprising approximately 1,200 manually annotated aerial
RGB images from Hurricanes Ian, Ida, and Ike. To mitigate human biases and
enhance data quality, labels from multiple annotators are strategically
aggregated and visual prompt engineering is employed. The resulting fine-tuned
model, named fCLIPSeg, achieves a Dice score of 0.70 on data from Hurricane Ida
-- a disaster event entirely excluded during training -- with virtually no
false positives in debris-free areas. This work presents the first
event-agnostic debris segmentation model requiring only standard RGB imagery
during deployment, making it well-suited for rapid, large-scale post-disaster
impact assessments and recovery planning.

Motivation: 手术室（OR）是一个复杂环境，优化工作流程对降低成本和提高患者结果至关重要。计算机视觉方法可用于自动识别围手术期事件，但隐私问题限制了其应用，因此需要隐私保护方法。

Method: 提出两阶段管道：第一阶段利用视觉基础模型生成去标识化的数字孪生（DT）；第二阶段采用SafeOR模型（双流融合方法）处理分割掩码和深度图进行事件检测。

Conclusion: 数字孪生支持隐私保护的手术室工作流程分析，促进去标识化数据的共享，并可能通过减少领域特异性外观差异增强模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Purpose: The operating room (OR) is a complex environment where optimizing
workflows is critical to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. The use of
computer vision approaches for the automatic recognition of perioperative
events enables identification of bottlenecks for OR optimization. However,
privacy concerns limit the use of computer vision for automated event detection
from OR videos, which makes privacy-preserving approaches needed for OR
workflow analysis. Methods: We propose a two-stage pipeline for
privacy-preserving OR video analysis and event detection. In the first stage,
we leverage vision foundation models for depth estimation and semantic
segmentation to generate de-identified Digital Twins (DT) of the OR from
conventional RGB videos. In the second stage, we employ the SafeOR model, a
fused two-stream approach that processes segmentation masks and depth maps for
OR event detection. We evaluate this method on an internal dataset of 38
simulated surgical trials with five event classes. Results: Our results
indicate that this DT-based approach to the OR event detection model achieves
performance on par and sometimes even better than raw RGB video-based models on
detecting OR events. Conclusion: DTs enable privacy-preserving OR workflow
analysis, facilitating the sharing of de-identified data across institutions
and they can potentially enhance model generalizability by mitigating
domain-specific appearance differences.

Conclusion: 通过整合椭圆形状先验，显著提升了SAM的分割精度。

Abstract: The elliptical shape prior information plays a vital role in improving the
accuracy of image segmentation for specific tasks in medical and natural
images. Existing deep learning-based segmentation methods, including the
Segment Anything Model (SAM), often struggle to produce segmentation results
with elliptical shapes efficiently. This paper proposes a new approach to
integrate the prior of elliptical shapes into the deep learning-based SAM image
segmentation techniques using variational methods. The proposed method
establishes a parameterized elliptical contour field, which constrains the
segmentation results to align with predefined elliptical contours. Utilizing
the dual algorithm, the model seamlessly integrates image features with
elliptical priors and spatial regularization priors, thereby greatly enhancing
segmentation accuracy. By decomposing SAM into four mathematical sub-problems,
we integrate the variational ellipse prior to design a new SAM network
structure, ensuring that the segmentation output of SAM consists of elliptical
regions. Experimental results on some specific image datasets demonstrate an
improvement over the original SAM.

Abstract: Labeling has always been expensive in the medical context, which has hindered
related deep learning application. Our work introduces active learning in
surgical video frame selection to construct a high-quality, affordable
Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy dataset for semantic segmentation. Active learning
allows the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) learning pipeline to include the dataset
construction workflow, which means DNNs trained by existing dataset will
identify the most informative data from the newly collected data. At the same
time, DNNs' performance and generalization ability improve over time when the
newly selected and annotated data are included in the training data. We
assessed different data informativeness measurements and found the deep
features distances select the most informative data in this task. Our
experiments show that with half of the data selected by active learning, the
DNNs achieve almost the same performance with 0.4349 mean Intersection over
Union (mIoU) compared to the same DNNs trained on the full dataset (0.4374
mIoU) on the critical anatomies and surgical instruments.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of diffusion models in image generation has increased
the demand for privacy-compliant unlearning. However, due to the
high-dimensional nature and complex feature representations of diffusion
models, achieving selective unlearning remains challenging, as existing methods
struggle to remove sensitive information while preserving the consistency of
non-sensitive regions. To address this, we propose an Automatic Dataset
Creation Framework based on prompt-based layered editing and training-free
local feature removal, constructing the ForgetMe dataset and introducing the
Entangled evaluation metric. The Entangled metric quantifies unlearning
effectiveness by assessing the similarity and consistency between the target
and background regions and supports both paired (Entangled-D) and unpaired
(Entangled-S) image data, enabling unsupervised evaluation. The ForgetMe
dataset encompasses a diverse set of real and synthetic scenarios, including
CUB-200-2011 (Birds), Stanford-Dogs, ImageNet, and a synthetic cat dataset. We
apply LoRA fine-tuning on Stable Diffusion to achieve selective unlearning on
this dataset and validate the effectiveness of both the ForgetMe dataset and
the Entangled metric, establishing them as benchmarks for selective unlearning.
Our work provides a scalable and adaptable solution for advancing
privacy-preserving generative AI.

Result: 在五个下游任务上的实验验证了CM3AE的有效性。

Conclusion: CM3AE为基于事件和RGB-Event融合的下游任务提供了强大支持。

Abstract: Event cameras have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to
their advantages in high dynamic range, high temporal resolution, low power
consumption, and low latency. Some researchers have begun exploring
pre-training directly on event data. Nevertheless, these efforts often fail to
establish strong connections with RGB frames, limiting their applicability in
multi-modal fusion scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a novel CM3AE
pre-training framework for the RGB-Event perception. This framework accepts
multi-modalities/views of data as input, including RGB images, event images,
and event voxels, providing robust support for both event-based and RGB-event
fusion based downstream tasks. Specifically, we design a multi-modal fusion
reconstruction module that reconstructs the original image from fused
multi-modal features, explicitly enhancing the model's ability to aggregate
cross-modal complementary information. Additionally, we employ a multi-modal
contrastive learning strategy to align cross-modal feature representations in a
shared latent space, which effectively enhances the model's capability for
multi-modal understanding and capturing global dependencies. We construct a
large-scale dataset containing 2,535,759 RGB-Event data pairs for the
pre-training. Extensive experiments on five downstream tasks fully demonstrated
the effectiveness of CM3AE. Source code and pre-trained models will be released
on https://github.com/Event-AHU/CM3AE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D-RES需要大量标注数据，成本高；现有半监督方法对伪标签利用不足，限制了模型性能。

Method: 提出3DResT框架，包含TSCS（选择高质量伪标签）和QDW（动态加权低质量伪标签）。

Result: 仅用1%标注数据，mIoU提升8.34点。

Conclusion: 3DResT有效解决了伪标签利用问题，显著降低了标注成本并提升了性能。

Abstract: 3D Referring Expression Segmentation (3D-RES) typically requires extensive
instance-level annotations, which are time-consuming and costly.
Semi-supervised learning (SSL) mitigates this by using limited labeled data
alongside abundant unlabeled data, improving performance while reducing
annotation costs. SSL uses a teacher-student paradigm where teacher generates
high-confidence-filtered pseudo-labels to guide student. However, in the
context of 3D-RES, where each label corresponds to a single mask and labeled
data is scarce, existing SSL methods treat high-quality pseudo-labels merely as
auxiliary supervision, which limits the model's learning potential. The
reliance on high-confidence thresholds for filtering often results in
potentially valuable pseudo-labels being discarded, restricting the model's
ability to leverage the abundant unlabeled data. Therefore, we identify two
critical challenges in semi-supervised 3D-RES, namely, inefficient utilization
of high-quality pseudo-labels and wastage of useful information from
low-quality pseudo-labels. In this paper, we introduce the first
semi-supervised learning framework for 3D-RES, presenting a robust baseline
method named 3DResT. To address these challenges, we propose two novel designs
called Teacher-Student Consistency-Based Sampling (TSCS) and Quality-Driven
Dynamic Weighting (QDW). TSCS aids in the selection of high-quality
pseudo-labels, integrating them into the labeled dataset to strengthen the
labeled supervision signals. QDW preserves low-quality pseudo-labels by
dynamically assigning them lower weights, allowing for the effective extraction
of useful information rather than discarding them. Extensive experiments
conducted on the widely used benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method. Notably, with only 1% labeled data, 3DResT achieves an mIoU improvement
of 8.34 points compared to the fully supervised method.

*Xin Su,Chen Wu,Yu Zhang,Chen Lyu,Zhuoran Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaQual-Diff是一种基于扩散的框架，通过直接集成感知质量评估到生成修复过程中，解决了复杂真实世界退化图像修复的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖间接线索，难以适应复杂退化的独特混合和严重性，导致修复效果不佳。

Method: 通过自适应质量提示机制，根据区域质量分数动态调整提示结构，实现计算资源的动态分配。

Result: 实验表明，AdaQual-Diff在合成和真实数据集上实现了视觉上更优的修复效果。

Conclusion: AdaQual-Diff通过质量引导和内容特定条件，实现了精细的区域修复控制，无需额外参数或推理迭代。

Abstract: Restoring images afflicted by complex real-world degradations remains
challenging, as conventional methods often fail to adapt to the unique mixture
and severity of artifacts present. This stems from a reliance on indirect cues
which poorly capture the true perceptual quality deficit. To address this
fundamental limitation, we introduce AdaQual-Diff, a diffusion-based framework
that integrates perceptual quality assessment directly into the generative
restoration process. Our approach establishes a mathematical relationship
between regional quality scores from DeQAScore and optimal guidance complexity,
implemented through an Adaptive Quality Prompting mechanism. This mechanism
systematically modulates prompt structure according to measured degradation
severity: regions with lower perceptual quality receive computationally
intensive, structurally complex prompts with precise restoration directives,
while higher quality regions receive minimal prompts focused on preservation
rather than intervention. The technical core of our method lies in the dynamic
allocation of computational resources proportional to degradation severity,
creating a spatially-varying guidance field that directs the diffusion process
with mathematical precision. By combining this quality-guided approach with
content-specific conditioning, our framework achieves fine-grained control over
regional restoration intensity without requiring additional parameters or
inference iterations. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaQual-Diff
achieves visually superior restorations across diverse synthetic and real-world
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景图生成方法在损坏图像上性能下降，主要由于视觉特征受损。布局信息具有领域不变性，可用于增强鲁棒性。

Method: 采用实例归一化过滤领域特定特征，通过布局导向恢复技术恢复结构特征，并提出布局嵌入编码器增强对象和谓词编码。

Result: 在VG-C数据集上，PredCls、SGCls和SGDet任务的mR@50分别相对提升5.6%、8.0%和6.5%，并在VG-C和GQA-C基准上达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: Robo-SGG作为即插即用模块，能显著提升现有方法的鲁棒性，且易于集成。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel method named Robo-SGG, i.e.,
Layout-Oriented Normalization and Restitution for Robust Scene Graph
Generation. Compared to the existing SGG setting, the robust scene graph
generation aims to perform inference on a diverse range of corrupted images,
with the core challenge being the domain shift between the clean and corrupted
images. Existing SGG methods suffer from degraded performance due to
compromised visual features e.g., corruption interference or occlusions. To
obtain robust visual features, we exploit the layout information, which is
domain-invariant, to enhance the efficacy of existing SGG methods on corrupted
images. Specifically, we employ Instance Normalization(IN) to filter out the
domain-specific feature and recover the unchangeable structural features, i.e.,
the positional and semantic relationships among objects by the proposed
Layout-Oriented Restitution. Additionally, we propose a Layout-Embedded Encoder
(LEE) that augments the existing object and predicate encoders within the SGG
framework, enriching the robust positional and semantic features of objects and
predicates. Note that our proposed Robo-SGG module is designed as a
plug-and-play component, which can be easily integrated into any baseline SGG
model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by integrating the
state-of-the-art method into our proposed Robo-SGG, we achieve relative
improvements of 5.6%, 8.0%, and 6.5% in mR@50 for PredCls, SGCls, and SGDet
tasks on the VG-C dataset, respectively, and achieve new state-of-the-art
performance in corruption scene graph generation benchmark (VG-C and GQA-C). We
will release our source code and model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于SAM的网络FAEWNet，用于解决建筑物变化检测中的领域差距、分布不平衡和时序不对齐问题，通过分布感知傅里叶适配器和边缘约束变形模块提升检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建筑物变化检测在多个领域具有重要应用，但现有方法（如SAM）因领域差距和分布不平衡问题表现不佳，且时序不对齐易受背景噪声干扰。

Method: FAEWNet结合SAM编码器提取特征，提出分布感知傅里叶适配器聚合任务导向的变化信息，并设计新的流模块优化边缘提取和高度偏移估计。

Result: 在LEVIR-CD、S2Looking和WHU-CD数据集上取得最先进结果，验证了FAEWNet的有效性。

Conclusion: FAEWNet通过创新适配器和流模块，显著提升了建筑物变化检测的精度和边缘识别能力。

Abstract: Building change detection remains challenging for urban development, disaster
assessment, and military reconnaissance. While foundation models like Segment
Anything Model (SAM) show strong segmentation capabilities, SAM is limited in
the task of building change detection due to domain gap issues. Existing
adapter-based fine-tuning approaches face challenges with imbalanced building
distribution, resulting in poor detection of subtle changes and inaccurate edge
extraction. Additionally, bi-temporal misalignment in change detection,
typically addressed by optical flow, remains vulnerable to background noises.
This affects the detection of building changes and compromises both detection
accuracy and edge recognition. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new
SAM-Based Network with Distribution-Aware Fourier Adaptation and
Edge-Constrained Warping (FAEWNet) for building change detection. FAEWNet
utilizes the SAM encoder to extract rich visual features from remote sensing
images. To guide SAM in focusing on specific ground objects in remote sensing
scenes, we propose a Distribution-Aware Fourier Aggregated Adapter to aggregate
task-oriented changed information. This adapter not only effectively addresses
the domain gap issue, but also pays attention to the distribution of changed
buildings. Furthermore, to mitigate noise interference and misalignment in
height offset estimation, we design a novel flow module that refines building
edge extraction and enhances the perception of changed buildings. Our
state-of-the-art results on the LEVIR-CD, S2Looking and WHU-CD datasets
highlight the effectiveness of FAEWNet. The code is available at
https://github.com/SUPERMAN123000/FAEWNet.

TL;DR: FramePack是一种神经网络结构，用于训练视频生成中的下一帧预测模型，通过压缩输入帧固定上下文长度，提高计算效率，并支持更大的训练批次。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频生成中因视频长度导致的上下文长度不固定问题，以及减少计算瓶颈和误差累积。

Method: 提出FramePack压缩输入帧，固定上下文长度；采用反漂移采样方法，按逆时间顺序生成帧以减少误差累积。

Result: 能够高效处理大量帧，训练批次大小接近图像扩散模型；现有视频扩散模型可通过FramePack微调，提升视觉质量。

Conclusion: FramePack为视频生成提供了一种高效且质量优化的方法，支持现有模型的改进。

Abstract: We present a neural network structure, FramePack, to train next-frame (or
next-frame-section) prediction models for video generation. The FramePack
compresses input frames to make the transformer context length a fixed number
regardless of the video length. As a result, we are able to process a large
number of frames using video diffusion with computation bottleneck similar to
image diffusion. This also makes the training video batch sizes significantly
higher (batch sizes become comparable to image diffusion training). We also
propose an anti-drifting sampling method that generates frames in inverted
temporal order with early-established endpoints to avoid exposure bias (error
accumulation over iterations). Finally, we show that existing video diffusion
models can be finetuned with FramePack, and their visual quality may be
improved because the next-frame prediction supports more balanced diffusion
schedulers with less extreme flow shift timesteps.

benchmark for camera-only 3D object detection.

Result: TTOG在nuScenes数据集上减少L2距离36.06%，在Bench2Drive数据集上驾驶分数提升22%。

Conclusion: TTOG通过统一规划和运动任务，显著提升了自动驾驶性能，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has made impressive progress in recent years.
Former end-to-end autonomous driving approaches often decouple planning and
motion tasks, treating them as separate modules. This separation overlooks the
potential benefits that planning can gain from learning out-of-distribution
data encountered in motion tasks. However, unifying these tasks poses
significant challenges, such as constructing shared contextual representations
and handling the unobservability of other vehicles' states. To address these
challenges, we propose TTOG, a novel two-stage trajectory generation framework.
In the first stage, a diverse set of trajectory candidates is generated, while
the second stage focuses on refining these candidates through vehicle state
information. To mitigate the issue of unavailable surrounding vehicle states,
TTOG employs a self-vehicle data-trained state estimator, subsequently extended
to other vehicles. Furthermore, we introduce ECSA (equivariant context-sharing
scene adapter) to enhance the generalization of scene representations across
different agents. Experimental results demonstrate that TTOG achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both planning and motion tasks. Notably, on
the challenging open-loop nuScenes dataset, TTOG reduces the L2 distance by
36.06\%. Furthermore, on the closed-loop Bench2Drive dataset, our approach
achieves a 22\% improvement in the driving score (DS), significantly
outperforming existing baselines.

Abstract: Arabidopsis is a widely used model plant to gain basic knowledge on plant
physiology and development. Live imaging is an important technique to visualize
and quantify elemental processes in plant development. To uncover novel
theories underlying plant growth and cell division, accurate cell tracking on
live imaging is of utmost importance. The commonly used cell tracking software,
TrackMate, adopts tracking-by-detection fashion, which applies Laplacian of
Gaussian (LoG) for blob detection, and Linear Assignment Problem (LAP) tracker
for tracking. However, they do not perform sufficiently when cells are densely
arranged. To alleviate the problems mentioned above, we propose an accurate
tracking method based on Genetic algorithm (GA) using knowledge of Arabidopsis
root cellular patterns and spatial relationship among volumes. Our method can
be described as a coarse-to-fine method, in which we first conducted relatively
easy line-level tracking of cell nuclei, then performed complicated nuclear
tracking based on known linear arrangement of cell files and their spatial
relationship between nuclei. Our method has been evaluated on a long-time live
imaging dataset of Arabidopsis root tips, and with minor manual rectification,
it accurately tracks nuclei. To the best of our knowledge, this research
represents the first successful attempt to address a long-standing problem in
the field of time-lapse microscopy in the root meristem by proposing an
accurate tracking method for Arabidopsis root nuclei.

Abstract: Building Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents is a promising research
direction, which simulates human interaction with computers or mobile phones to
perform diverse GUI tasks. However, a major challenge in developing generalized
GUI agents is the lack of sufficient trajectory data across various operating
systems and applications, mainly due to the high cost of manual annotations. In
this paper, we propose the TongUI framework that builds generalized GUI agents
by learning from rich multimodal web tutorials. Concretely, we crawl and
process online GUI tutorials (such as videos and articles) into GUI agent
trajectory data, through which we produce the GUI-Net dataset containing 143K
trajectory data across five operating systems and more than 200 applications.
We develop the TongUI agent by fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B models on GUI-Net,
which show remarkable performance improvements on commonly used grounding and
navigation benchmarks, outperforming baseline agents about 10\% on multiple
benchmarks, showing the effectiveness of the GUI-Net dataset and underscoring
the significance of our TongUI framework. We will fully open-source the code,
the GUI-Net dataset, and the trained models soon.

Abstract: Multi-class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection algorithms (MUAD) are receiving
increasing attention due to their relatively low deployment costs and improved
training efficiency. However, the real-world effectiveness of MUAD methods is
questioned due to limitations in current Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD)
datasets. These datasets contain numerous classes that are unlikely to be
produced by the same factory and fail to cover multiple structures or
appearances. Additionally, the defects do not reflect real-world
characteristics. Therefore, we introduce the Heterogeneous Same-Sort Industrial
Anomaly Detection (HSS-IAD) dataset, which contains 8,580 images of
metallic-like industrial parts and precise anomaly annotations. These parts
exhibit variations in structure and appearance, with subtle defects that
closely resemble the base materials. We also provide foreground images for
synthetic anomaly generation. Finally, we evaluate popular IAD methods on this
dataset under multi-class and class-separated settings, demonstrating its
potential to bridge the gap between existing datasets and real factory
conditions. The dataset is available at

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了跨场景3D姿态估计的域偏移问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Existing 3D human pose estimation methods often suffer in performance, when
applied to cross-scenario inference, due to domain shifts in characteristics
such as camera viewpoint, position, posture, and body size. Among these
factors, camera viewpoints and locations {have been shown} to contribute
significantly to the domain gap by influencing the global positions of human
poses. To address this, we propose a novel framework that explicitly conducts
global transformations between pose positions in the camera coordinate systems
of source and target domains. We start with a Pseudo-Label Generation Module
that is applied to the 2D poses of the target dataset to generate pseudo-3D
poses. Then, a Global Transformation Module leverages a human-centered
coordinate system as a novel bridging mechanism to seamlessly align the
positional orientations of poses across disparate domains, ensuring consistent
spatial referencing. To further enhance generalization, a Pose Augmentor is
incorporated to address variations in human posture and body size. This process
is iterative, allowing refined pseudo-labels to progressively improve guidance
for domain adaptation. Our method is evaluated on various cross-dataset
benchmarks, including Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW. The proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and even outperforms the target-trained
model.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image editing have utilized large-scale multimodal
models to enable intuitive, natural instruction-driven interactions. However,
conventional methods still face significant challenges, particularly in spatial
reasoning, precise region segmentation, and maintaining semantic consistency,
especially in complex scenes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
SmartFreeEdit, a novel end-to-end framework that integrates a multimodal large
language model (MLLM) with a hypergraph-enhanced inpainting architecture,
enabling precise, mask-free image editing guided exclusively by natural
language instructions. The key innovations of SmartFreeEdit include:(1)the
introduction of region aware tokens and a mask embedding paradigm that enhance
the spatial understanding of complex scenes;(2) a reasoning segmentation
pipeline designed to optimize the generation of editing masks based on natural
language instructions;and (3) a hypergraph-augmented inpainting module that
ensures the preservation of both structural integrity and semantic coherence
during complex edits, overcoming the limitations of local-based image
generation. Extensive experiments on the Reason-Edit benchmark demonstrate that
SmartFreeEdit surpasses current state-of-the-art methods across multiple
evaluation metrics, including segmentation accuracy, instruction adherence, and
visual quality preservation, while addressing the issue of local information
focus and improving global consistency in the edited image. Our project will be

Abstract: The significant achievements of pre-trained models leveraging large volumes
of data in the field of NLP and 2D vision inspire us to explore the potential
of extensive data pre-training for 3D perception in autonomous driving. Toward
this goal, this paper proposes to utilize massive unlabeled data from
heterogeneous datasets to pre-train 3D perception models. We introduce a
self-supervised pre-training framework that learns effective 3D representations
from scratch on unlabeled data, combined with a prompt adapter based domain
adaptation strategy to reduce dataset bias. The approach significantly improves
model performance on downstream tasks such as 3D object detection, BEV
segmentation, 3D object tracking, and occupancy prediction, and shows steady
performance increase as the training data volume scales up, demonstrating the
potential of continually benefit 3D perception models for autonomous driving.
We will release the source code to inspire further investigations in the
community.

TL;DR: CLIP-Refine是一种后预训练方法，旨在通过随机特征对齐和混合对比蒸馏技术，减少CLIP模型中的模态间隙，提升零样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在多模态特征空间中存在模态间隙，影响下游任务性能，现有方法成本高或导致零样本性能下降。

Method: 提出CLIP-Refine，结合随机特征对齐（RaFA）和混合对比蒸馏（HyCD），在小数据集上进行1轮训练。

Result: 实验表明，CLIP-Refine有效减少模态间隙并提升零样本性能。

Conclusion: CLIP-Refine是一种高效的后预训练方法，平衡了特征对齐和知识保留。

Abstract: Contrastive language image pre-training (CLIP) is an essential component of
building modern vision-language foundation models. While CLIP demonstrates
remarkable zero-shot performance on downstream tasks, the multi-modal feature
spaces still suffer from a modality gap, which is a gap between image and text
feature clusters and limits downstream task performance. Although existing
works attempt to address the modality gap by modifying pre-training or
fine-tuning, they struggle with heavy training costs with large datasets or
degradations of zero-shot performance. This paper presents CLIP-Refine, a
post-pre-training method for CLIP models at a phase between pre-training and
fine-tuning. CLIP-Refine aims to align the feature space with 1 epoch training
on small image-text datasets without zero-shot performance degradations. To
this end, we introduce two techniques: random feature alignment (RaFA) and
hybrid contrastive-distillation (HyCD). RaFA aligns the image and text features
to follow a shared prior distribution by minimizing the distance to random
reference vectors sampled from the prior. HyCD updates the model with hybrid
soft labels generated by combining ground-truth image-text pair labels and
outputs from the pre-trained CLIP model. This contributes to achieving both
maintaining the past knowledge and learning new knowledge to align features.
Our extensive experiments with multiple classification and retrieval tasks show
that CLIP-Refine succeeds in mitigating the modality gap and improving the
zero-shot performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaskMark是一个简单、高效且灵活的图像水印框架，包含MaskMark-D和MaskMark-ED两种变体，支持全局和局部水印嵌入与提取，性能优于现有基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像水印技术中全局和局部水印嵌入与提取的需求，同时提升水印的鲁棒性和视觉质量。

Method: 基于Encoder-Distortion-Decoder训练范式，引入掩码机制支持局部提取，并通过定位模块减少干扰。MaskMark-ED进一步将掩码应用于编码阶段以增强局部鲁棒性。

Result: 在全局和局部水印提取、定位及多水印嵌入任务中达到最先进性能，计算成本仅为WAM的1/15。

Conclusion: MaskMark在高效性、灵活性和性能上均优于现有方法，适用于多种水印需求。

Abstract: We present MaskMark, a simple, efficient and flexible framework for image
watermarking. MaskMark has two variants: MaskMark-D, which supports global
watermark embedding, watermark localization, and local watermark extraction for
applications such as tamper detection, and MaskMark-ED, which focuses on local
watermark embedding and extraction with enhanced robustness in small regions,
enabling localized image protection. Built upon the classical Encoder-
Distortion-Decoder training paradigm, MaskMark-D introduces a simple masking
mechanism during the decoding stage to support both global and local watermark
extraction. A mask is applied to the watermarked image before extraction,
allowing the decoder to focus on selected regions and learn local extraction. A
localization module is also integrated into the decoder to identify watermark
regions during inference, reducing interference from irrelevant content and
improving accuracy. MaskMark-ED extends this design by incorporating the mask
into the encoding stage as well, guiding the encoder to embed the watermark in
designated local regions for enhanced robustness. Comprehensive experiments
show that MaskMark achieves state-of-the-art performance in global watermark
extraction, local watermark extraction, watermark localization, and
multi-watermark embedding. It outperforms all existing baselines, including the
recent leading model WAM for local watermarking, while preserving high visual
quality of the watermarked images. MaskMark is also flexible, by adjusting the
distortion layer, it can adapt to different robustness requirements with just a
few steps of fine-tuning. Moreover, our approach is efficient and easy to
optimize, requiring only 20 hours on a single A6000 GPU with just 1/15 the
computational cost of WAM.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种跨图像反个性化（CAP）框架，通过增强图像间的风格一致性来提升隐私保护效果，并引入动态比率调整策略优化攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型和个性化技术的快速发展，攻击者可以利用公开图像生成高度逼真的伪造肖像，引发隐私问题。现有反个性化方法忽略了多图像间的关联性，隐私保护效果有限。

Method: 提出CAP框架，通过强制扰动图像间的风格一致性增强隐私保护，并设计动态比率调整策略平衡一致性损失的影响。

Result: 在CelebHQ和VGGFace2基准测试中，CAP显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CAP通过跨图像视角和动态调整策略，有效提升了反个性化攻击的效果，为隐私保护提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models and personalization techniques has
made it possible to recreate individual portraits from just a few publicly
available images. While such capabilities empower various creative
applications, they also introduce serious privacy concerns, as adversaries can
exploit them to generate highly realistic impersonations. To counter these
threats, anti-personalization methods have been proposed, which add adversarial
perturbations to published images to disrupt the training of personalization
models. However, existing approaches largely overlook the intrinsic multi-image
nature of personalization and instead adopt a naive strategy of applying
perturbations independently, as commonly done in single-image settings. This
neglects the opportunity to leverage inter-image relationships for stronger
privacy protection. Therefore, we advocate for a group-level perspective on
privacy protection against personalization. Specifically, we introduce
Cross-image Anti-Personalization (CAP), a novel framework that enhances
resistance to personalization by enforcing style consistency across perturbed
images. Furthermore, we develop a dynamic ratio adjustment strategy that
adaptively balances the impact of the consistency loss throughout the attack
iterations. Extensive experiments on the classical CelebHQ and VGGFace2
benchmarks show that CAP substantially improves existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的任务RLAD和框架LAD-Reasoner，通过逻辑推理扩展传统异常检测，采用两阶段训练方法，性能接近大模型但更轻量且可解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工业异常检测方法依赖复杂模块或设计，限制了实际部署和可解释性。

Method: 提出LAD-Reasoner框架，基于Qwen2.5-VL 3B，采用SFT和GRPO两阶段训练，结合检测准确性和输出结构质量优化。

Result: 在MVTec LOCO AD数据集上，LAD-Reasoner性能接近Qwen2.5-VL-72B，且生成更简洁可解释的结果。

Conclusion: LAD-Reasoner减少了对大模型和复杂管道的依赖，提供了透明且可解释的逻辑异常检测方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in industrial anomaly detection have highlighted the need for
deeper logical anomaly analysis, where unexpected relationships among objects,
counts, and spatial configurations must be identified and explained. Existing
approaches often rely on large-scale external reasoning modules or elaborate
pipeline designs, hindering practical deployment and interpretability. To
address these limitations, we introduce a new task, Reasoning Logical Anomaly
Detection (RLAD), which extends traditional anomaly detection by incorporating
logical reasoning. We propose a new framework, LAD-Reasoner, a customized tiny
multimodal language model built on Qwen2.5-VL 3B. Our approach leverages a
two-stage training paradigm that first employs Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for
fine-grained visual understanding, followed by Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to refine logical anomaly detection and enforce coherent,
human-readable reasoning. Crucially, reward signals are derived from both the
detection accuracy and the structural quality of the outputs, obviating the
need for building chain of thought (CoT) reasoning data. Experiments on the
MVTec LOCO AD dataset show that LAD-Reasoner, though significantly smaller,
matches the performance of Qwen2.5-VL-72B in accuracy and F1 score, and further
excels in producing concise and interpretable rationales. This unified design
reduces reliance on large models and complex pipelines, while offering
transparent and interpretable insights into logical anomaly detection. Code and
data will be released.

TL;DR: DepthForge通过结合视觉基础模型（VFMs）和深度信息，提出了一种新的域泛化语义分割（DGSS）框架，显著提升了模型的几何一致性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉线索易受干扰，而几何信息（如深度）更稳定，因此研究如何将深度信息与VFMs结合以提升性能。

Method: 提出DepthForge框架，利用冻结的DINOv2/EVA02和Depth Anything V2提取视觉和深度信息，通过深度感知可学习令牌和深度细化解码器增强模型。

Result: 在多个DGSS设置和数据集上，DepthForge表现优于其他方法，尤其在极端条件下（如夜间和雪天）表现突出。

Conclusion: DepthForge通过整合深度信息显著提升了VFMs的泛化能力和性能，为DGSS提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) have delivered remarkable performance in
Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS). However, recent methods often
overlook the fact that visual cues are susceptible, whereas the underlying
geometry remains stable, rendering depth information more robust. In this
paper, we investigate the potential of integrating depth information with
features from VFMs, to improve the geometric consistency within an image and
boost the generalization performance of VFMs. We propose a novel fine-tuning
DGSS framework, named DepthForge, which integrates the visual cues from frozen
DINOv2 or EVA02 and depth cues from frozen Depth Anything V2. In each layer of
the VFMs, we incorporate depth-aware learnable tokens to continuously decouple
domain-invariant visual and spatial information, thereby enhancing depth
awareness and attention of the VFMs. Finally, we develop a depth refinement
decoder and integrate it into the model architecture to adaptively refine
multi-layer VFM features and depth-aware learnable tokens. Extensive
experiments are conducted based on various DGSS settings and five different
datsets as unseen target domains. The qualitative and quantitative results
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms alternative approaches
with stronger performance, steadier visual-spatial attention, and superior
generalization ability. In particular, DepthForge exhibits outstanding
performance under extreme conditions (e.g., night and snow). Code is available
at https://github.com/anonymouse-xzrptkvyqc/DepthForge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保文本到图像模型的伦理部署，需要防止生成有害或不适当内容。现有方法存在局限性，如锚点无方法导致视觉伪影，锚点方法依赖启发式选择。

Method: ANT通过反转条件方向，在去噪中后期精确修改内容而不破坏早期结构完整性，提出轨迹感知目标和权重显著性图。

Result: 实验表明，ANT在单概念和多概念擦除中均达到最优效果，生成高质量安全输出。

Conclusion: ANT提供了一种高效、无需启发式锚点选择的概念擦除解决方案，显著提升了生成内容的安全性。

Abstract: Ensuring the ethical deployment of text-to-image models requires effective
techniques to prevent the generation of harmful or inappropriate content. While
concept erasure methods offer a promising solution, existing finetuning-based
approaches suffer from notable limitations. Anchor-free methods risk disrupting
sampling trajectories, leading to visual artifacts, while anchor-based methods
rely on the heuristic selection of anchor concepts. To overcome these
shortcomings, we introduce a finetuning framework, dubbed ANT, which
Automatically guides deNoising Trajectories to avoid unwanted concepts. ANT is
built on a key insight: reversing the condition direction of classifier-free
guidance during mid-to-late denoising stages enables precise content
modification without sacrificing early-stage structural integrity. This
inspires a trajectory-aware objective that preserves the integrity of the
early-stage score function field, which steers samples toward the natural image
manifold, without relying on heuristic anchor concept selection. For
single-concept erasure, we propose an augmentation-enhanced weight saliency map
to precisely identify the critical parameters that most significantly
contribute to the unwanted concept, enabling more thorough and efficient
erasure. For multi-concept erasure, our objective function offers a versatile
plug-and-play solution that significantly boosts performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ANT achieves state-of-the-art results in both
single and multi-concept erasure, delivering high-quality, safe outputs without
compromising the generative fidelity. Code is available at

Motivation: 遥感图像与自然图像差异大，现有模型难以适应，且交互方式有限，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出多模态内容整合方法、跨域单阶段融合训练策略和像素感知模块，统一了参考与定位任务。

Result: 实验显示EarthGPT-X在多粒度任务中表现优越，多模态交互灵活。

Conclusion: EarthGPT-X在遥感领域显著推进了多模态大语言模型的应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in the visual-language area have developed natural
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for spatial reasoning through visual
prompting. However, due to remote sensing (RS) imagery containing abundant
geospatial information that differs from natural images, it is challenging to
effectively adapt natural spatial models to the RS domain. Moreover, current RS
MLLMs are limited in overly narrow interpretation levels and interaction
manner, hindering their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address those
challenges, a spatial MLLM named EarthGPT-X is proposed, enabling a
comprehensive understanding of multi-source RS imagery, such as optical,
synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and infrared. EarthGPT-X offers zoom-in and
zoom-out insight, and possesses flexible multi-grained interactive abilities.
Moreover, EarthGPT-X unifies two types of critical spatial tasks (i.e.,
referring and grounding) into a visual prompting framework. To achieve these
versatile capabilities, several key strategies are developed. The first is the
multi-modal content integration method, which enhances the interplay between
images, visual prompts, and text instructions. Subsequently, a cross-domain
one-stage fusion training strategy is proposed, utilizing the large language
model (LLM) as a unified interface for multi-source multi-task learning.
Furthermore, by incorporating a pixel perception module, the referring and
grounding tasks are seamlessly unified within a single framework. In addition,
the experiments conducted demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
EarthGPT-X in multi-grained tasks and its impressive flexibility in multi-modal
interaction, revealing significant advancements of MLLM in the RS field.

TL;DR: TSGS是一种新框架，通过分离几何学习和外观优化，解决了透明表面3D重建中的透明深度难题，显著提升了几何精度和渲染效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 透明表面重建在实验室机器人操作等任务中至关重要，但现有3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）方法因透明深度问题导致几何精度不足。

Method: TSGS分两阶段：几何学习阶段使用抑制镜面反射的输入；外观优化阶段通过各向异性镜面建模提升视觉保真度，同时保持几何精度。此外，采用首表面深度提取方法增强深度推断。

Result: 在TransLab数据集上，TSGS显著优于现有方法，倒角距离降低37.3%，F1分数提升8.0%。

Conclusion: TSGS在3DGS框架内实现了透明物体的高精度几何重建和逼真渲染，为透明表面重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing transparent surfaces is essential for tasks such as robotic
manipulation in labs, yet it poses a significant challenge for 3D
reconstruction techniques like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). These methods
often encounter a transparency-depth dilemma, where the pursuit of
photorealistic rendering through standard $\alpha$-blending undermines
geometric precision, resulting in considerable depth estimation errors for
transparent materials. To address this issue, we introduce Transparent Surface
Gaussian Splatting (TSGS), a new framework that separates geometry learning
from appearance refinement. In the geometry learning stage, TSGS focuses on
geometry by using specular-suppressed inputs to accurately represent surfaces.
In the second stage, TSGS improves visual fidelity through anisotropic specular
modeling, crucially maintaining the established opacity to ensure geometric
accuracy. To enhance depth inference, TSGS employs a first-surface depth
extraction method. This technique uses a sliding window over $\alpha$-blending
weights to pinpoint the most likely surface location and calculates a robust
weighted average depth. To evaluate the transparent surface reconstruction task
under realistic conditions, we collect a TransLab dataset that includes complex
transparent laboratory glassware. Extensive experiments on TransLab show that
TSGS achieves accurate geometric reconstruction and realistic rendering of
transparent objects simultaneously within the efficient 3DGS framework.
Specifically, TSGS significantly surpasses current leading methods, achieving a
37.3% reduction in chamfer distance and an 8.0% improvement in F1 score
compared to the top baseline. The code and dataset will be released at
https://longxiang-ai.github.io/TSGS/.

Conclusion: SADRE为水印去除设定了新标准，提供了灵活可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: As digital content becomes increasingly ubiquitous, the need for robust
watermark removal techniques has grown due to the inadequacy of existing
embedding techniques, which lack robustness. This paper introduces a novel
Saliency-Aware Diffusion Reconstruction (SADRE) framework for watermark
elimination on the web, combining adaptive noise injection, region-specific
perturbations, and advanced diffusion-based reconstruction. SADRE disrupts
embedded watermarks by injecting targeted noise into latent representations
guided by saliency masks although preserving essential image features. A
reverse diffusion process ensures high-fidelity image restoration, leveraging
adaptive noise levels determined by watermark strength. Our framework is
theoretically grounded with stability guarantees and achieves robust watermark
removal across diverse scenarios. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art
(SOTA) watermarking techniques demonstrate SADRE's superiority in balancing
watermark disruption and image quality. SADRE sets a new benchmark for
watermark elimination, offering a flexible and reliable solution for real-world
web content. Code is available

Motivation: 当前生成式AI在4D动态物体生成上仍面临数据不足和计算需求高的挑战。

Result: 实验证明TwoSquared能生成纹理和几何一致的4D序列。

Conclusion: TwoSquared为4D生成提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the astonishing progress in generative AI, 4D dynamic object
generation remains an open challenge. With limited high-quality training data
and heavy computing requirements, the combination of hallucinating unseen
geometry together with unseen movement poses great challenges to generative
models. In this work, we propose TwoSquared as a method to obtain a 4D
physically plausible sequence starting from only two 2D RGB images
corresponding to the beginning and end of the action. Instead of directly
solving the 4D generation problem, TwoSquared decomposes the problem into two
steps: 1) an image-to-3D module generation based on the existing generative
model trained on high-quality 3D assets, and 2) a physically inspired
deformation module to predict intermediate movements. To this end, our method
does not require templates or object-class-specific prior knowledge and can
take in-the-wild images as input. In our experiments, we demonstrate that
TwoSquared is capable of producing texture-consistent and geometry-consistent
4D sequences only given 2D images.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to training specialized instruction-based
image-editing diffusion models, addressing key challenges in structural
preservation with input images and semantic alignment with user prompts. We
introduce an online reinforcement learning framework that aligns the diffusion
model with human preferences without relying on extensive human annotations or
curating a large dataset. Our method significantly improves the realism and
alignment with instructions in two ways. First, the proposed models achieve
precise and structurally coherent modifications in complex scenes while
maintaining high fidelity in instruction-irrelevant areas. Second, they capture
fine nuances in the desired edit by leveraging a visual prompt, enabling
detailed control over visual edits without lengthy textual prompts. This
approach simplifies users' efforts to achieve highly specific edits, requiring
only 5 reference images depicting a certain concept for training. Experimental
results demonstrate that our models can perform intricate edits in complex
scenes, after just 10 training steps. Finally, we showcase the versatility of
our method by applying it to robotics, where enhancing the visual realism of
simulated environments through targeted sim-to-real image edits improves their
utility as proxies for real-world settings.

Motivation: 现有GAN反演方法忽略了输入与输出未掩码区域的一致性，且未充分利用多模态信息，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出多模态引导编码器（含门控掩码感知注意力模块）和F&W+潜在空间，并设计Soft-update Mean Latent模块生成高保真纹理。

Result: 在六个数据集上，MMInvertFill在质量和数量上均优于现有方法，并能有效完成域外图像修复。

Conclusion: MMInvertFill通过多模态和潜在空间优化，显著提升了图像修复的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) inversion have demonstrated excellent
performance in image inpainting that aims to restore lost or damaged image
texture using its unmasked content. Previous GAN inversion-based methods
usually utilize well-trained GAN models as effective priors to generate the
realistic regions for missing holes. Despite excellence, they ignore a hard
constraint that the unmasked regions in the input and the output should be the
same, resulting in a gap between GAN inversion and image inpainting and thus
degrading the performance. Besides, existing GAN inversion approaches often
consider a single modality of the input image, neglecting other auxiliary cues
in images for improvements. Addressing these problems, we propose a novel GAN
inversion approach, dubbed MMInvertFill, for image inpainting. MMInvertFill
contains primarily a multimodal guided encoder with a pre-modulation and a GAN
generator with F&W+ latent space. Specifically, the multimodal encoder aims to
enhance the multi-scale structures with additional semantic segmentation edge
texture modalities through a gated mask-aware attention module. Afterwards, a
pre-modulation is presented to encode these structures into style vectors. To
mitigate issues of conspicuous color discrepancy and semantic inconsistency, we
introduce the F&W+ latent space to bridge the gap between GAN inversion and
image inpainting. Furthermore, in order to reconstruct faithful and
photorealistic images, we devise a simple yet effective Soft-update Mean Latent
module to capture more diversified in-domain patterns for generating
high-fidelity textures for massive corruptions. In our extensive experiments on
six challenging datasets, we show that our MMInvertFill qualitatively and
quantitatively outperforms other state-of-the-arts and it supports the
completion of out-of-domain images effectively.

Abstract: Contemporary digital technology has a pivotal role in the design of
customized medical appliances, including occlusal splints used in the treatment
of stomatognathic system dysfunctions. We present an approach to computer-aided
design and precision assessment of positioning occlusal splints, bridging
clinical concepts with current digital dental practice. In our model, a 3D
splint is generated based on a transformation matrix that represents the
therapeutic change in mandibular position, defined by a specialist using a
virtual patient model reconstructed from intraoral scans, CBCT, 3D facial scans
and plaster model digitisation. The paper introduces a novel method for
generating splints that accurately reproduce occlusal conditions in the
therapeutic position, including a mechanism for resolving surface conflicts
through virtual embossing. We demonstrate how transformation matrices can be
acquired through clinical tools and intraoral devices, and evaluate the
accuracy of the designed and printed splints using profile and surface
deviation analysis. The proposed method enables reproducible, patient-specific
splint fabrication and opens new possibilities in diagnostics, multimodal image
registration and quantification of occlusal discrepancies.

Result: 在RGB-T数据集上优于现有方法，并在大视差、遮挡、恶劣天气等挑战性场景中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SC3EF框架有效解决了RGB-T图像配准问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Multispectral imaging plays a critical role in a range of intelligent
transportation applications, including advanced driver assistance systems
(ADAS), traffic monitoring, and night vision. However, accurate visible and
thermal (RGB-T) image registration poses a significant challenge due to the
considerable modality differences. In this paper, we present a novel joint
Self-Correlation and Cross-Correspondence Estimation Framework (SC3EF),
leveraging both local representative features and global contextual cues to
effectively generate RGB-T correspondences. For this purpose, we design a
convolution-transformer-based pipeline to extract local representative features
and encode global correlations of intra-modality for inter-modality
correspondence estimation between unaligned visible and thermal images. After
merging the local and global correspondence estimation results, we further
employ a hierarchical optical flow estimation decoder to progressively refine
the estimated dense correspondence maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method, outperforming the current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on representative RGB-T datasets. Furthermore,
it also shows competitive generalization capabilities across challenging
scenarios, including large parallax, severe occlusions, adverse weather, and
other cross-modal datasets (e.g., RGB-N and RGB-D).

Result: 实验表明，Tree-NeRV在压缩效率和重建质量上优于传统均匀采样方法。

Conclusion: Tree-NeRV通过树结构和动态采样策略，显著提升了视频编码性能。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV) have emerged as a powerful
paradigm for video representation, enabling direct mappings from frame indices
to video frames. However, existing NeRV-based methods do not fully exploit
temporal redundancy, as they rely on uniform sampling along the temporal axis,
leading to suboptimal rate-distortion (RD) performance. To address this
limitation, we propose Tree-NeRV, a novel tree-structured feature
representation for efficient and adaptive video encoding. Unlike conventional
approaches, Tree-NeRV organizes feature representations within a Binary Search
Tree (BST), enabling non-uniform sampling along the temporal axis.
Additionally, we introduce an optimization-driven sampling strategy,
dynamically allocating higher sampling density to regions with greater temporal
variation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Tree-NeRV achieves superior
compression efficiency and reconstruction quality, outperforming prior uniform
sampling-based methods. Code will be released.

Motivation: 3D高斯溅射（3DGS）依赖一阶优化器如Adam，训练时间长，需改进。

Method: 利用Jacobian的稀疏性，提出无矩阵和GPU并行化的LM优化，结合采样策略和学习率启发式方法。

Result: 方法比标准LM快3倍，在低高斯数量时比Adam快6倍，中等数量时仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: 二阶优化策略显著提升了3DGS的训练效率。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is widely used for novel view synthesis due to
its high rendering quality and fast inference time. However, 3DGS predominantly
relies on first-order optimizers such as Adam, which leads to long training
times. To address this limitation, we propose a novel second-order optimization
strategy based on Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) and Conjugate Gradient (CG), which
we specifically tailor towards Gaussian Splatting. Our key insight is that the
Jacobian in 3DGS exhibits significant sparsity since each Gaussian affects only
a limited number of pixels. We exploit this sparsity by proposing a matrix-free
and GPU-parallelized LM optimization. To further improve its efficiency, we
propose sampling strategies for both the camera views and loss function and,
consequently, the normal equation, significantly reducing the computational
complexity. In addition, we increase the convergence rate of the second-order
approximation by introducing an effective heuristic to determine the learning
rate that avoids the expensive computation cost of line search methods. As a
result, our method achieves a $3\times$ speedup over standard LM and
outperforms Adam by $~6\times$ when the Gaussian count is low while remaining
competitive for moderate counts. Project Page:

Conclusion: 该方法高效解决了冗余计算问题，适用于高层次视觉任务的图像压缩。

Abstract: In recent years, image compression for high-level vision tasks has attracted
considerable attention from researchers. Given that object information in
images plays a far more crucial role in downstream tasks than background
information, some studies have proposed semantically structuring the bitstream
to selectively transmit and reconstruct only the information required by these
tasks. However, such methods structure the bitstream after encoding, meaning
that the coding process still relies on the entire image, even though much of
the encoded information will not be transmitted. This leads to redundant
computations. Traditional image compression methods require a two-dimensional
image as input, and even if the unimportant regions of the image are set to
zero by applying a semantic mask, these regions still participate in subsequent
computations as part of the image. To address such limitations, we propose an
image compression method based on a position-indexed self-attention mechanism
that encodes and decodes only the visible parts of the masked image. Compared
to existing semantic-structured compression methods, our approach can
significantly reduce computational costs.

Method: 通过分析前一层的不同激活模式，解耦多义通道为单义通道。

Result: 成功提升了CNN的可解释性，改进了特征可视化等解释技术。

Conclusion: 解耦多义通道是提升CNN可解释性的有效方法。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability is concerned with analyzing individual
components in a (convolutional) neural network (CNN) and how they form larger
circuits representing decision mechanisms. These investigations are challenging
since CNNs frequently learn polysemantic channels that encode distinct
concepts, making them hard to interpret. To address this, we propose an
algorithm to disentangle a specific kind of polysemantic channel into multiple
channels, each responding to a single concept. Our approach restructures
weights in a CNN, utilizing that different concepts within the same channel
exhibit distinct activation patterns in the previous layer. By disentangling
these polysemantic features, we enhance the interpretability of CNNs,
ultimately improving explanatory techniques such as feature visualizations.

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，GDFusion显著优于基线方法，在Occ3D基准上提升1.4%-4.8% mIoU，并减少27%-72%内存消耗。

Conclusion: GDFusion通过系统分析时间线索和创新的融合策略，为VisionOcc框架提供了高效的时间融合解决方案。

Abstract: We present GDFusion, a temporal fusion method for vision-based 3D semantic
occupancy prediction (VisionOcc). GDFusion opens up the underexplored aspects
of temporal fusion within the VisionOcc framework, focusing on both temporal
cues and fusion strategies. It systematically examines the entire VisionOcc
pipeline, identifying three fundamental yet previously overlooked temporal
cues: scene-level consistency, motion calibration, and geometric
complementation. These cues capture diverse facets of temporal evolution and
make distinct contributions across various modules in the VisionOcc framework.
To effectively fuse temporal signals across heterogeneous representations, we
propose a novel fusion strategy by reinterpreting the formulation of vanilla
RNNs. This reinterpretation leverages gradient descent on features to unify the
integration of diverse temporal information, seamlessly embedding the proposed
temporal cues into the network. Extensive experiments on nuScenes demonstrate
that GDFusion significantly outperforms established baselines. Notably, on
Occ3D benchmark, it achieves 1.4\%-4.8\% mIoU improvements and reduces memory
consumption by 27\%-72\%.

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: VLCA通过结合语言和视觉空间，成功提升了域泛化能力。

Abstract: Domain generalization aims at training on source domains to uncover a
domain-invariant feature space, allowing the model to perform robust
generalization ability on unknown target domains. However, due to domain gaps,
it is hard to find reliable common image feature space, and the reason for that
is the lack of suitable basic units for images. Different from image in vision
space, language has comprehensive expression elements that can effectively
convey semantics. Inspired by the semantic completeness of language and
intuitiveness of image, we propose VLCA, which combine language space and
vision space, and connect the multiple image domains by using semantic space as
the bridge domain. Specifically, in language space, by taking advantage of the
completeness of language basic units, we tend to capture the semantic
representation of the relations between categories through word vector
distance. Then, in vision space, by taking advantage of the intuitiveness of
image features, the common pattern of sample features with the same class is
explored through low-rank approximation. In the end, the language
representation is aligned with the vision representation through the multimodal
space of text and image. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method.

Conclusion: 通过结合物理建模和两阶段优化，该方法显著提升了合成异常数据的质量，为工业异常检测提供了更可靠的训练数据。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a crucial task in computer vision, yet collecting
real-world defect images is inherently difficult due to the rarity and
unpredictability of anomalies. Consequently, researchers have turned to
synthetic methods for training data augmentation. However, existing synthetic
strategies (e.g., naive cut-and-paste or inpainting) overlook the underlying
physical causes of defects, leading to inconsistent, low-fidelity anomalies
that hamper model generalization to real-world complexities. In this thesis, we
introduced a novel pipeline that generates synthetic anomalies through
Math-Physics model guidance, refines them via a Coarse-to-Fine approach and
employs a bi-level optimization strategy with a Synthesis Quality
Estimator(SQE). By incorporating physical modeling of cracks, corrosion, and
deformation, our method produces realistic defect masks, which are subsequently
enhanced in two phases. The first stage (npcF) enforces a PDE-based consistency
to achieve a globally coherent anomaly structure, while the second stage
(npcF++) further improves local fidelity using wavelet transforms and boundary
synergy blocks. Additionally, we leverage SQE-driven weighting, ensuring that
high-quality synthetic samples receive greater emphasis during training. To
validate our approach, we conducted comprehensive experiments on three widely
adopted industrial anomaly detection benchmarks: MVTec AD, VisA, and BTAD.
Across these datasets, the proposed pipeline achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
results in both image-AUROC and pixel-AUROC, confirming the effectiveness of
our MaPhC2F and BiSQAD.

Abstract: Efficiently transferring Learned Image Compression (LIC) model from human
perception to machine perception is an emerging challenge in vision-centric
representation learning. Existing approaches typically adapt LIC to downstream
tasks in a single-task manner, which is inefficient, lacks task interaction,
and results in multiple task-specific bitstreams. To address these limitations,
we propose an asymmetric adaptor framework that supports multi-task adaptation
within a single model. Our method introduces a shared adaptor to learn general
semantic features and task-specific adaptors to preserve task-level
distinctions. With only lightweight plug-in modules and a frozen base codec,
our method achieves strong performance across multiple tasks while maintaining
compression efficiency. Experiments on the PASCAL-Context benchmark demonstrate
that our method outperforms both Fully Fine-Tuned and other Parameter Efficient
Fine-Tuned (PEFT) baselines, and validating the effectiveness of multi-vision

Abstract: Deep learning-based point cloud modeling has been widely investigated as an
indispensable component of general shape analysis. Recently, transformer and
state space model (SSM) have shown promising capacities in point cloud
learning. However, limited research has been conducted on medical point clouds,
which have great potential in disease diagnosis and treatment. This paper
presents an SSM-based hierarchical feature learning framework for medical point
cloud understanding. Specifically, we down-sample input into multiple levels
through the farthest point sampling. At each level, we perform a series of
k-nearest neighbor (KNN) queries to aggregate multi-scale structural
information. To assist SSM in processing point clouds, we introduce
coordinate-order and inside-out scanning strategies for efficient serialization
of irregular points. Point features are calculated progressively from short
neighbor sequences and long point sequences through vanilla and group Point SSM
blocks, to capture both local patterns and long-range dependencies. To evaluate
the proposed method, we build a large-scale medical point cloud dataset named
MedPointS for anatomy classification, completion, and segmentation. Extensive
experiments conducted on MedPointS demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance across all tasks. The dataset is available at
https://flemme-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/medpoints.html. Code is merged to

assignments is achieved by geometric numerical integration of a Riemannian
ascent flow, as critical point of a Lagrangian action functional. Experiments
illustrate properties of the approach, including uncertainty quantification of

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TTRD3的模型，通过多尺度特征提取、纹理转移和双扩散模型，解决了遥感图像超分辨率重建中的三大挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在遥感图像超分辨率重建中存在多尺度特征提取困难、语义不一致以及几何精度与视觉质量权衡失衡的问题。

Method: TTRD3模型包含多尺度特征聚合块（MFAB）、稀疏纹理转移引导模块（STTG）和残差去噪双扩散模型（RDDM）。

Result: 实验表明，TTRD3在多个遥感数据集上优于现有方法，LPIPS提升1.43%，FID提升3.67%。

Conclusion: TTRD3通过创新设计有效解决了遥感图像超分辨率重建的三大挑战，显著提升了重建质量。

Abstract: Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution (RSISR) reconstructs high-resolution
(HR) remote sensing images from low-resolution inputs to support fine-grained
ground object interpretation. Existing methods face three key challenges: (1)
Difficulty in extracting multi-scale features from spatially heterogeneous RS
scenes, (2) Limited prior information causing semantic inconsistency in
reconstructions, and (3) Trade-off imbalance between geometric accuracy and
visual quality. To address these issues, we propose the Texture Transfer
Residual Denoising Dual Diffusion Model (TTRD3) with three innovations: First,
a Multi-scale Feature Aggregation Block (MFAB) employing parallel heterogeneous
convolutional kernels for multi-scale feature extraction. Second, a Sparse
Texture Transfer Guidance (STTG) module that transfers HR texture priors from
reference images of similar scenes. Third, a Residual Denoising Dual Diffusion
Model (RDDM) framework combining residual diffusion for deterministic
reconstruction and noise diffusion for diverse generation. Experiments on
multi-source RS datasets demonstrate TTRD3's superiority over state-of-the-art
methods, achieving 1.43% LPIPS improvement and 3.67% FID enhancement compared
to best-performing baselines. Code/model: https://github.com/LED-666/TTRD3.

TL;DR: 提出了一种原型PRVR框架，通过固定数量的原型编码视频的多样化上下文，同时引入多种策略增强文本关联和视频理解，并通过跨模态和单模态重建任务保持原型可搜索性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在部分相关视频检索（PRVR）中，同时实现搜索准确性和效率具有挑战性，因为多样化的上下文表示会增加计算和内存成本。

Method: 提出原型PRVR框架，将视频的多样化上下文编码为固定数量的原型，并引入文本关联和视频理解策略，以及跨模态和单模态重建任务。

Result: 在TVR、ActivityNet-Captions和QVHighlights上的广泛评估验证了方法的有效性，且未牺牲效率。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了PRVR中准确性和效率的权衡问题，通过原型编码和多种策略实现了高效且准确的检索。

Abstract: In a retrieval system, simultaneously achieving search accuracy and
efficiency is inherently challenging. This challenge is particularly pronounced
in partially relevant video retrieval (PRVR), where incorporating more diverse
context representations at varying temporal scales for each video enhances
accuracy but increases computational and memory costs. To address this
dichotomy, we propose a prototypical PRVR framework that encodes diverse
contexts within a video into a fixed number of prototypes. We then introduce
several strategies to enhance text association and video understanding within
the prototypes, along with an orthogonal objective to ensure that the
prototypes capture a diverse range of content. To keep the prototypes
searchable via text queries while accurately encoding video contexts, we
implement cross- and uni-modal reconstruction tasks. The cross-modal
reconstruction task aligns the prototypes with textual features within a shared
space, while the uni-modal reconstruction task preserves all video contexts
during encoding. Additionally, we employ a video mixing technique to provide
weak guidance to further align prototypes and associated textual
representations. Extensive evaluations on TVR, ActivityNet-Captions, and
QVHighlights validate the effectiveness of our approach without sacrificing
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模糊视频超分辨率方法因缺乏运动信息和高频细节，难以恢复高分辨率下的清晰细节，导致明显伪影和抖动。

Method: 引入事件信号，提出事件增强网络Ev-DeblurVSR，包括互惠特征去模糊模块和混合可变形对齐模块，融合帧与事件信息。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上达到最新性能，真实数据上比FMA-Net准确度提升2.59 dB，速度快7.28倍。

Conclusion: Ev-DeblurVSR通过事件信号有效解决了模糊视频超分辨率的挑战，显著提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the task of blurry video super-resolution (BVSR),
aiming to generate high-resolution (HR) videos from low-resolution (LR) and
blurry inputs. Current BVSR methods often fail to restore sharp details at high
resolutions, resulting in noticeable artifacts and jitter due to insufficient
motion information for deconvolution and the lack of high-frequency details in
LR frames. To address these challenges, we introduce event signals into BVSR
and propose a novel event-enhanced network, Ev-DeblurVSR. To effectively fuse
information from frames and events for feature deblurring, we introduce a
reciprocal feature deblurring module that leverages motion information from
intra-frame events to deblur frame features while reciprocally using global
scene context from the frames to enhance event features. Furthermore, to
enhance temporal consistency, we propose a hybrid deformable alignment module
that fully exploits the complementary motion information from inter-frame
events and optical flow to improve motion estimation in the deformable
alignment process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Ev-DeblurVSR
establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world
datasets. Notably, on real data, our method is +2.59 dB more accurate and
7.28$\times$ faster than the recent best BVSR baseline FMA-Net. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EKGNet提出了一种基于改进3D-DenseNet的模型，通过上下文感知映射网络和动态核生成模块，解决了高光谱图像分类中的高维数据、稀疏分布和光谱冗余问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分类面临高维数据、稀疏分布和光谱冗余等挑战，导致过拟合和泛化能力受限。

Method: EKGNet结合上下文感知映射模块和动态核生成机制，动态生成卷积核组合权重，构建自适应专家卷积系统。

Result: 在IN、UP和KSC数据集上表现优于主流方法。

Conclusion: EKGNet通过动态专家卷积系统提升了模型表示能力，无需增加网络深度或宽度。

Abstract: Deep neural networks face several challenges in hyperspectral image
classification, including high-dimensional data, sparse distribution of ground
objects, and spectral redundancy, which often lead to classification
overfitting and limited generalization capability. To more efficiently adapt to
ground object distributions while extracting image features without introducing
excessive parameters and skipping redundant information, this paper proposes
EKGNet based on an improved 3D-DenseNet model, consisting of a context-aware
mapping network and a dynamic kernel generation module. The context-aware
mapping module translates global contextual information of hyperspectral inputs
into instructions for combining base convolutional kernels, while the dynamic
kernels are composed of K groups of base convolutions, analogous to K different
types of experts specializing in fundamental patterns across various
dimensions. The mapping module and dynamic kernel generation mechanism form a
tightly coupled system - the former generates meaningful combination weights
based on inputs, while the latter constructs an adaptive expert convolution
system using these weights. This dynamic approach enables the model to focus
more flexibly on key spatial structures when processing different regions,
rather than relying on the fixed receptive field of a single static
convolutional kernel. EKGNet enhances model representation capability through a
3D dynamic expert convolution system without increasing network depth or width.
The proposed method demonstrates superior performance on IN, UP, and KSC
datasets, outperforming mainstream hyperspectral image classification
approaches.

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在策略探索和视觉感知方面存在不足，影响了推理能力。

Method: 提出NoisyRollout方法，混合干净和失真图像轨迹，引入视觉导向的归纳偏置，并采用噪声退火计划。

Result: 仅用2.1K训练样本，在5个领域外基准测试中达到最优性能，同时保持领域内性能。

Conclusion: NoisyRollout通过噪声增强探索能力，显著提升了视觉语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have strengthened the
reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). However, enhancing
policy exploration to more effectively scale test-time compute remains
underexplored in VLMs. In addition, VLMs continue to struggle with imperfect
visual perception, which in turn affects the subsequent reasoning process. To
this end, we propose NoisyRollout, a simple yet effective RL approach that
mixes trajectories from both clean and moderately distorted images to introduce
targeted diversity in visual perception and the resulting reasoning patterns.
Without additional training cost, NoisyRollout enhances the exploration
capabilities of VLMs by incorporating a vision-oriented inductive bias.
Furthermore, NoisyRollout employs a noise annealing schedule that gradually
reduces distortion strength over training, ensuring benefit from noisy signals
early while maintaining training stability and scalability in later stages.
With just 2.1K training samples, NoisyRollout achieves state-of-the-art
performance among open-source RL-tuned models on 5 out-of-domain benchmarks
spanning both reasoning and perception tasks, while preserving comparable or
even better in-domain performance.

Conclusion: 分布式成像为智能眼镜的小型化和高性能提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years smart glasses technology has rapidly advanced, opening up
entirely new areas for mobile computing. We expect future smart glasses will
need to be all-day wearable, adopting a small form factor to meet the
requirements of volume, weight, fashionability and social acceptability, which
puts significant constraints on the space of possible solutions. Additional
challenges arise due to the fact that smart glasses are worn in arbitrary
environments while their wearer moves and performs everyday activities. In this
paper, we systematically analyze the space of imaging from smart glasses and
derive several fundamental limits that govern this imaging domain. We discuss
the impact of these limits on achievable image quality and camera module size
-- comparing in particular to related devices such as mobile phones. We then
propose a novel distributed imaging approach that allows to minimize the size
of the individual camera modules when compared to a standard monolithic camera
design. Finally, we demonstrate the properties of this novel approach in a
series of experiments using synthetic data as well as images captured with two
different prototype implementations.

Result: 在六种模型和数据集组合上，AUC值超过0.937，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: ArtistAuditor在真实场景中表现优异，为版权保护提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Text-to-image models based on diffusion processes, such as DALL-E, Stable
Diffusion, and Midjourney, are capable of transforming texts into detailed
images and have widespread applications in art and design. As such, amateur
users can easily imitate professional-level paintings by collecting an artist's
work and fine-tuning the model, leading to concerns about artworks' copyright
infringement. To tackle these issues, previous studies either add visually
imperceptible perturbation to the artwork to change its underlying styles
(perturbation-based methods) or embed post-training detectable watermarks in
the artwork (watermark-based methods). However, when the artwork or the model
has been published online, i.e., modification to the original artwork or model
retraining is not feasible, these strategies might not be viable.
  To this end, we propose a novel method for data-use auditing in the
text-to-image generation model. The general idea of ArtistAuditor is to
identify if a suspicious model has been finetuned using the artworks of
specific artists by analyzing the features related to the style. Concretely,
ArtistAuditor employs a style extractor to obtain the multi-granularity style
representations and treats artworks as samplings of an artist's style. Then,
ArtistAuditor queries a trained discriminator to gain the auditing decisions.
The experimental results on six combinations of models and datasets show that
ArtistAuditor can achieve high AUC values (> 0.937). By studying
ArtistAuditor's transferability and core modules, we provide valuable insights
into the practical implementation. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
ArtistAuditor in real-world cases by an online platform Scenario. ArtistAuditor

Motivation: 超声心动图依赖经验丰富的操作者，AI辅助或全自动扫描系统有望解决这一问题，但现有机器学习模型难以理解心脏解剖结构和探头运动与视觉信号的复杂关系。

Method: EchoWorld采用世界建模预训练策略，预测掩蔽解剖区域并模拟探头调整的视觉结果；微调阶段引入运动感知注意力机制，整合历史数据。

Result: 在超过100万张超声图像上验证，EchoWorld显著减少引导误差，优于现有视觉骨干和引导框架。

Conclusion: EchoWorld通过编码解剖知识和运动动态，实现了高精度的超声探头引导，为AI辅助超声扫描提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Echocardiography is crucial for cardiovascular disease detection but relies
heavily on experienced sonographers. Echocardiography probe guidance systems,
which provide real-time movement instructions for acquiring standard plane
images, offer a promising solution for AI-assisted or fully autonomous
scanning. However, developing effective machine learning models for this task
remains challenging, as they must grasp heart anatomy and the intricate
interplay between probe motion and visual signals. To address this, we present
EchoWorld, a motion-aware world modeling framework for probe guidance that
encodes anatomical knowledge and motion-induced visual dynamics, while
effectively leveraging past visual-motion sequences to enhance guidance
precision. EchoWorld employs a pre-training strategy inspired by world modeling
principles, where the model predicts masked anatomical regions and simulates
the visual outcomes of probe adjustments. Built upon this pre-trained model, we
introduce a motion-aware attention mechanism in the fine-tuning stage that
effectively integrates historical visual-motion data, enabling precise and
adaptive probe guidance. Trained on more than one million ultrasound images
from over 200 routine scans, EchoWorld effectively captures key
echocardiographic knowledge, as validated by qualitative analysis. Moreover,
our method significantly reduces guidance errors compared to existing visual
backbones and guidance frameworks, excelling in both single-frame and
sequential evaluation protocols. Code is available at

Result: 模型能够生成高质量、长视频，并支持专业电影风格生成。

Conclusion: SkyReels-V2通过多模态和多阶段方法，显著提升了视频生成的逼真度和专业性。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have been driven by diffusion models and
autoregressive frameworks, yet critical challenges persist in harmonizing
prompt adherence, visual quality, motion dynamics, and duration: compromises in
motion dynamics to enhance temporal visual quality, constrained video duration
(5-10 seconds) to prioritize resolution, and inadequate shot-aware generation
stemming from general-purpose MLLMs' inability to interpret cinematic grammar,
such as shot composition, actor expressions, and camera motions. These
intertwined limitations hinder realistic long-form synthesis and professional
film-style generation. To address these limitations, we propose SkyReels-V2, an
Infinite-length Film Generative Model, that synergizes Multi-modal Large
Language Model (MLLM), Multi-stage Pretraining, Reinforcement Learning, and
Diffusion Forcing Framework. Firstly, we design a comprehensive structural
representation of video that combines the general descriptions by the
Multi-modal LLM and the detailed shot language by sub-expert models. Aided with
human annotation, we then train a unified Video Captioner, named
SkyCaptioner-V1, to efficiently label the video data. Secondly, we establish
progressive-resolution pretraining for the fundamental video generation,
followed by a four-stage post-training enhancement: Initial concept-balanced
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) improves baseline quality; Motion-specific
Reinforcement Learning (RL) training with human-annotated and synthetic
distortion data addresses dynamic artifacts; Our diffusion forcing framework
with non-decreasing noise schedules enables long-video synthesis in an
efficient search space; Final high-quality SFT refines visual fidelity. All the

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dual-region augmentation approach designed to
reduce reliance on large-scale labeled datasets while improving model
robustness and adaptability across diverse computer vision tasks, including
source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) and person re-identification (ReID). Our
method performs targeted data transformations by applying random noise
perturbations to foreground objects and spatially shuffling background patches.
This effectively increases the diversity of the training data, improving model
robustness and generalization. Evaluations on the PACS dataset for SFDA
demonstrate that our augmentation strategy consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving significant accuracy improvements in both single-target and
multi-target adaptation settings. By augmenting training data through
structured transformations, our method enables model generalization across

Abstract: Computer vision is transforming fashion through Virtual Try-On (VTON) and
Virtual Try-Off (VTOFF). VTON generates images of a person in a specified

challenging variant, Person-to-Person Virtual Try-On (p2p-VTON), uses a photo
of another person wearing the garment. VTOFF, on the other hand, extracts
standardized garment images from clothed individuals. We introduce TryOffDiff,
a diffusion-based VTOFF model. Built on a latent diffusion framework with
SigLIP image conditioning, it effectively captures garment properties like
texture, shape, and patterns. TryOffDiff achieves state-of-the-art results on
VITON-HD and strong performance on DressCode dataset, covering upper-body,

Result: 在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence数据集上，EventVAD使用7B MLLM在无训练设置下达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: EventVAD通过事件感知和多模态推理，显著提升了无训练视频异常检测的效果。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection~(VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies within videos.
Supervised methods require an amount of in-domain training data and often
struggle to generalize to unseen anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods
leverage the intrinsic world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to
detect anomalies but face challenges in localizing fine-grained visual
transitions and diverse events. Therefore, we propose EventVAD, an event-aware
video anomaly detection framework that combines tailored dynamic graph
architectures and multimodal LLMs through temporal-event reasoning.
Specifically, EventVAD first employs dynamic spatiotemporal graph modeling with
time-decay constraints to capture event-aware video features. Then, it performs
adaptive noise filtering and uses signal ratio thresholding to detect event
boundaries via unsupervised statistical features. The statistical boundary
detection module reduces the complexity of processing long videos for MLLMs and
improves their temporal reasoning through event consistency. Finally, it
utilizes a hierarchical prompting strategy to guide MLLMs in performing
reasoning before determining final decisions. We conducted extensive
experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. The results demonstrate
that EventVAD with a 7B MLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in training-free
settings, outperforming strong baselines that use 7B or larger MLLMs.

Abstract: This study conducts a detailed comparison of RF-DETR object detection base
model and YOLOv12 object detection model configurations for detecting
greenfruits in a complex orchard environment marked by label ambiguity,
occlusions, and background blending. A custom dataset was developed featuring
both single-class (greenfruit) and multi-class (occluded and non-occluded
greenfruits) annotations to assess model performance under dynamic real-world
conditions. RF-DETR object detection model, utilizing a DINOv2 backbone and
deformable attention, excelled in global context modeling, effectively
identifying partially occluded or ambiguous greenfruits. In contrast, YOLOv12
leveraged CNN-based attention for enhanced local feature extraction, optimizing
it for computational efficiency and edge deployment. RF-DETR achieved the
highest mean Average Precision (mAP50) of 0.9464 in single-class detection,
proving its superior ability to localize greenfruits in cluttered scenes.
Although YOLOv12N recorded the highest mAP@50:95 of 0.7620, RF-DETR
consistently outperformed in complex spatial scenarios. For multi-class
detection, RF-DETR led with an mAP@50 of 0.8298, showing its capability to
differentiate between occluded and non-occluded fruits, while YOLOv12L scored
highest in mAP@50:95 with 0.6622, indicating better classification in detailed
occlusion contexts. Training dynamics analysis highlighted RF-DETR's swift
convergence, particularly in single-class settings where it plateaued within 10
epochs, demonstrating the efficiency of transformer-based architectures in
adapting to dynamic visual data. These findings validate RF-DETR's
effectiveness for precision agricultural applications, with YOLOv12 suited for
fast-response scenarios. >Index Terms: RF-DETR object detection, YOLOv12,

Abstract: Flow matching models have emerged as a strong alternative to diffusion
models, but existing inversion and editing methods designed for diffusion are
often ineffective or inapplicable to them. The straight-line, non-crossing
trajectories of flow models pose challenges for diffusion-based approaches but
also open avenues for novel solutions. In this paper, we introduce a
predictor-corrector-based framework for inversion and editing in flow models.
First, we propose Uni-Inv, an effective inversion method designed for accurate
reconstruction. Building on this, we extend the concept of delayed injection to
flow models and introduce Uni-Edit, a region-aware, robust image editing
approach. Our methodology is tuning-free, model-agnostic, efficient, and
effective, enabling diverse edits while ensuring strong preservation of
edit-irrelevant regions. Extensive experiments across various generative models
demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of Uni-Inv and Uni-Edit, even
under low-cost settings. Project page: https://uniedit-flow.github.io/

TL;DR: 论文研究了视觉语言模型（VLMs）的组合创造力，提出IEI框架评估其创造力，并通过实验验证其在理解和生成任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨VLMs是否具备组合创造力，即通过结合现有概念生成新想法的能力，而非仅是训练数据的模式匹配。

Method: 提出IEI框架（识别-解释-隐含），分解创意过程为三个层次，并构建CreativeMashup数据集进行验证。

Result: 在理解任务中，VLMs表现优于普通人但不及专家；在生成任务中，IEI框架显著提升VLM输出的创意质量。

Conclusion: 研究为评估人工创造力提供了理论基础，并为提升VLMs的创意生成能力提供了实用指导。

Abstract: The ability to combine existing concepts into novel ideas stands as a
fundamental hallmark of human intelligence. Recent advances in Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) like GPT-4V and DALLE-3 have sparked debate about whether their
outputs reflect combinational creativity--defined by M. A. Boden (1998) as
synthesizing novel ideas through combining existing concepts--or sophisticated
pattern matching of training data. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science,
we investigate the combinational creativity of VLMs from the lens of concept
blending. We propose the Identification-Explanation-Implication (IEI)
framework, which decomposes creative processes into three levels: identifying
input spaces, extracting shared attributes, and deriving novel semantic
implications. To validate this framework, we curate CreativeMashup, a
high-quality dataset of 666 artist-generated visual mashups annotated according
to the IEI framework. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that in
comprehension tasks, best VLMs have surpassed average human performance while
falling short of expert-level understanding; in generation tasks, incorporating
our IEI framework into the generation pipeline significantly enhances the
creative quality of VLMs outputs. Our findings establish both a theoretical
foundation for evaluating artificial creativity and practical guidelines for
improving creative generation in VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LVMs在视频理解中存在与人类直觉不对齐和视频幻觉问题，需要更精细的文本-视频偏好对齐方法。

Method: VistaDPO在三个层次上优化对齐：实例级别（整体内容与回答）、时间级别（事件描述与时间语义）、感知级别（空间对象与语言标记）。

Result: 实验表明，VistaDPO显著提升LVMs性能，有效减少视频-语言不对齐和幻觉问题。

Conclusion: VistaDPO通过分层优化和构建新数据集（VistaDPO-7k），为视频理解提供了更精准的对齐方法。

Abstract: Large Video Models (LVMs) built upon Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
promise in video understanding but often suffer from misalignment with human
intuition and video hallucination issues. To address these challenges, we
introduce VistaDPO, a novel framework for Video Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal
Direct Preference Optimization. VistaDPO enhances text-video preference
alignment across three hierarchical levels: i) Instance Level, aligning overall
video content with responses; ii) Temporal Level, aligning video temporal
semantics with event descriptions; and iii) Perceptive Level, aligning spatial
objects with language tokens. Given the lack of datasets for fine-grained
video-language preference alignment, we construct VistaDPO-7k, a dataset of
7.2K QA pairs annotated with chosen and rejected responses, along with
spatial-temporal grounding information such as timestamps, keyframes, and
bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as Video
Hallucination, Video QA, and Captioning performance tasks demonstrate that
VistaDPO significantly improves the performance of existing LVMs, effectively
mitigating video-language misalignment and hallucination. The code and data are
available at https://github.com/HaroldChen19/VistaDPO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型预训练依赖高质量图像-文本对，但随着数据规模增长，此类数据稀缺且饱和，限制了领域发展。

Method: 提出了一种生成高质量、低幻觉合成字幕的新流程，并采用连续DPO方法减少幻觉。

Result: 合成字幕在35个视觉语言任务中性能提升至少6.2%，同时在文本到图像领域显著降低FID分数。

Conclusion: 合成字幕可作为真实数据的有效替代，显著提升模型性能，并发布了低幻觉合成字幕数据集Hunyuan-Recap100M。

Abstract: In recent years, the field of vision-language model pre-training has
experienced rapid advancements, driven primarily by the continuous enhancement
of textual capabilities in large language models. However, existing training
paradigms for multimodal large language models heavily rely on high-quality
image-text pairs. As models and data scales grow exponentially, the
availability of such meticulously curated data has become increasingly scarce
and saturated, thereby severely limiting further advancements in this domain.
This study investigates scalable caption generation techniques for
vision-language model pre-training and demonstrates that large-scale
low-hallucination synthetic captions can serve dual purposes: 1) acting as a
viable alternative to real-world data for pre-training paradigms and 2)
achieving superior performance enhancement when integrated into vision-language
models through empirical validation. This paper presents three key
contributions: 1) a novel pipeline for generating high-quality,
low-hallucination, and knowledge-rich synthetic captions. Our continuous DPO
methodology yields remarkable results in reducing hallucinations. Specifically,
the non-hallucination caption rate on a held-out test set increases from 48.2%
to 77.9% for a 7B-size model. 2) Comprehensive empirical validation reveals
that our synthetic captions confer superior pre-training advantages over their
counterparts. Across 35 vision language tasks, the model trained with our data
achieves a significant performance gain of at least 6.2% compared to alt-text
pairs and other previous work. Meanwhile, it also offers considerable support
in the text-to-image domain. With our dataset, the FID score is reduced by 17.1
on a real-world validation benchmark and 13.3 on the MSCOCO validation
benchmark. 3) We will release Hunyuan-Recap100M, a low-hallucination and
knowledge-intensive synthetic caption dataset.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to integrating scientific knowledge into
generative models, enhancing their realism and consistency in image synthesis.
First, we introduce Science-T2I, an expert-annotated adversarial dataset
comprising adversarial 20k image pairs with 9k prompts, covering wide distinct
scientific knowledge categories. Leveraging Science-T2I, we present SciScore,
an end-to-end reward model that refines the assessment of generated images
based on scientific knowledge, which is achieved by augmenting both the
scientific comprehension and visual capabilities of pre-trained CLIP model.
Additionally, based on SciScore, we propose a two-stage training framework,
comprising a supervised fine-tuning phase and a masked online fine-tuning
phase, to incorporate scientific knowledge into existing generative models.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in establishing new standards for evaluating the scientific realism
of generated content. Specifically, SciScore attains performance comparable to
human-level, demonstrating a 5% improvement similar to evaluations conducted by
experienced human evaluators. Furthermore, by applying our proposed fine-tuning
method to FLUX, we achieve a performance enhancement exceeding 50% on SciScore.

TL;DR: PCBEAR提出了一种基于人体姿态序列的概念瓶颈框架，用于可解释的动作识别，结合静态和动态姿态概念，实现了高性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频XAI方法难以捕捉动作动态和时间依赖性，PCBEAR旨在通过人体姿态序列提供更透明和可解释的动作识别。

Method: PCBEAR利用人体骨架姿态作为运动感知的概念，通过聚类自动发现静态和动态姿态概念，无需人工标注。

Result: 在KTH、Penn-Action和HAA500数据集上验证了PCBEAR的高分类性能和可解释性。

Conclusion: PCBEAR不仅预测性能强，还提供了人类可理解的模型推理过程，支持调试和改进模型行为。

Abstract: Human action recognition (HAR) has achieved impressive results with deep
learning models, but their decision-making process remains opaque due to their
black-box nature. Ensuring interpretability is crucial, especially for
real-world applications requiring transparency and accountability. Existing
video XAI methods primarily rely on feature attribution or static textual
concepts, both of which struggle to capture motion dynamics and temporal
dependencies essential for action understanding. To address these challenges,
we propose Pose Concept Bottleneck for Explainable Action Recognition (PCBEAR),
a novel concept bottleneck framework that introduces human pose sequences as
motion-aware, structured concepts for video action recognition. Unlike methods
based on pixel-level features or static textual descriptions, PCBEAR leverages
human skeleton poses, which focus solely on body movements, providing robust
and interpretable explanations of motion dynamics. We define two types of
pose-based concepts: static pose concepts for spatial configurations at
individual frames, and dynamic pose concepts for motion patterns across
multiple frames. To construct these concepts, PCBEAR applies clustering to
video pose sequences, allowing for automatic discovery of meaningful concepts
without manual annotation. We validate PCBEAR on KTH, Penn-Action, and HAA500,
showing that it achieves high classification performance while offering
interpretable, motion-driven explanations. Our method provides both strong
predictive performance and human-understandable insights into the model's
reasoning process, enabling test-time interventions for debugging and improving
model behavior.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Complex-Edit基准，用于评估基于指令的图像编辑模型在不同复杂度指令下的表现，并揭示了开源模型与闭源模型的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏系统性评估图像编辑模型在复杂指令下表现的基准，因此需要开发一个全面的评估工具。

Method: 利用GPT-4o自动收集多样化的编辑指令，采用“Chain-of-Edit”流程生成复杂指令，并引入VLM自动评估管道。

Result: 开源模型表现显著落后于闭源模型，复杂指令会降低模型保留关键元素和美学质量的能力，分解指令会进一步降低性能。

Conclusion: Complex-Edit基准揭示了图像编辑模型的局限性，并提出了改进策略（如Best-of-N选择），同时指出了合成数据的潜在问题。

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{Complex-Edit}$, a comprehensive benchmark designed to
systematically evaluate instruction-based image editing models across
instructions of varying complexity. To develop this benchmark, we harness
GPT-4o to automatically collect a diverse set of editing instructions at scale.
Our approach follows a well-structured ``Chain-of-Edit'' pipeline: we first
generate individual atomic editing tasks independently and then integrate them
to form cohesive, complex instructions. Additionally, we introduce a suite of
metrics to assess various aspects of editing performance, along with a
VLM-based auto-evaluation pipeline that supports large-scale assessments. Our
benchmark yields several notable insights: 1) Open-source models significantly
underperform relative to proprietary, closed-source models, with the
performance gap widening as instruction complexity increases; 2) Increased
instructional complexity primarily impairs the models' ability to retain key
elements from the input images and to preserve the overall aesthetic quality;
3) Decomposing a complex instruction into a sequence of atomic steps, executed
in a step-by-step manner, substantially degrades performance across multiple
metrics; 4) A straightforward Best-of-N selection strategy improves results for
both direct editing and the step-by-step sequential approach; and 5) We observe
a ``curse of synthetic data'': when synthetic data is involved in model
training, the edited images from such models tend to appear increasingly
synthetic as the complexity of the editing instructions rises -- a phenomenon
that intriguingly also manifests in the latest GPT-4o outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态3D重建和点跟踪通常被视为独立任务，但它们有深层联系，St4RTrack旨在统一这两项任务。

Method: 通过预测一对帧的点图，并在世界坐标系中保持3D对应关系，结合重投影损失进行训练。

Result: 提出了一个统一的框架，并在新基准上验证了其有效性和效率。

Conclusion: St4RTrack为动态3D重建和跟踪提供了一种数据驱动的统一方法，代码和基准将公开。

Abstract: Dynamic 3D reconstruction and point tracking in videos are typically treated
as separate tasks, despite their deep connection. We propose St4RTrack, a
feed-forward framework that simultaneously reconstructs and tracks dynamic
video content in a world coordinate frame from RGB inputs. This is achieved by
predicting two appropriately defined pointmaps for a pair of frames captured at
different moments. Specifically, we predict both pointmaps at the same moment,
in the same world, capturing both static and dynamic scene geometry while
maintaining 3D correspondences. Chaining these predictions through the video
sequence with respect to a reference frame naturally computes long-range
correspondences, effectively combining 3D reconstruction with 3D tracking.
Unlike prior methods that rely heavily on 4D ground truth supervision, we
employ a novel adaptation scheme based on a reprojection loss. We establish a
new extensive benchmark for world-frame reconstruction and tracking,
demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of our unified, data-driven
framework. Our code, model, and benchmark will be released.

Result: 实现了最先进的开放词汇分割性能，语义场重建速度快30倍。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且语义一致，支持多粒度开放词汇感知。

Abstract: Bridging natural language and 3D geometry is a crucial step toward flexible,
language-driven scene understanding. While recent advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have enabled fast and high-quality scene reconstruction,
research has also explored incorporating open-vocabulary understanding into
3DGS. However, most existing methods require iterative optimization over
per-view 2D semantic feature maps, which not only results in inefficiencies but
also leads to inconsistent 3D semantics across views. To address these
limitations, we introduce a training-free framework that constructs a
superpoint graph directly from Gaussian primitives. The superpoint graph
partitions the scene into spatially compact and semantically coherent regions,
forming view-consistent 3D entities and providing a structured foundation for
open-vocabulary understanding. Based on the graph structure, we design an
efficient reprojection strategy that lifts 2D semantic features onto the
superpoints, avoiding costly multi-view iterative training. The resulting
representation ensures strong 3D semantic coherence and naturally supports
hierarchical understanding, enabling both coarse- and fine-grained
open-vocabulary perception within a unified semantic field. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
open-vocabulary segmentation performance, with semantic field reconstruction
completed over $30\times$ faster. Our code will be available at

Result: 通过混合数据集微调算法，将相机旋转误差在5度以内的准确率从5%提升至56%，并在下游任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了极端视角变化问题，展示了在实际应用中的实用价值。

Abstract: We explore the task of geometric reconstruction of images captured from a
mixture of ground and aerial views. Current state-of-the-art learning-based
approaches fail to handle the extreme viewpoint variation between aerial-ground
image pairs. Our hypothesis is that the lack of high-quality, co-registered
aerial-ground datasets for training is a key reason for this failure. Such data
is difficult to assemble precisely because it is difficult to reconstruct in a
scalable way. To overcome this challenge, we propose a scalable framework
combining pseudo-synthetic renderings from 3D city-wide meshes (e.g., Google
Earth) with real, ground-level crowd-sourced images (e.g., MegaDepth). The
pseudo-synthetic data simulates a wide range of aerial viewpoints, while the
real, crowd-sourced images help improve visual fidelity for ground-level images
where mesh-based renderings lack sufficient detail, effectively bridging the
domain gap between real images and pseudo-synthetic renderings. Using this
hybrid dataset, we fine-tune several state-of-the-art algorithms and achieve
significant improvements on real-world, zero-shot aerial-ground tasks. For
example, we observe that baseline DUSt3R localizes fewer than 5% of
aerial-ground pairs within 5 degrees of camera rotation error, while
fine-tuning with our data raises accuracy to nearly 56%, addressing a major
failure point in handling large viewpoint changes. Beyond camera estimation and
scene reconstruction, our dataset also improves performance on downstream tasks
like novel-view synthesis in challenging aerial-ground scenarios, demonstrating
the practical value of our approach in real-world applications.

Abstract: Personalized image synthesis has emerged as a pivotal application in
text-to-image generation, enabling the creation of images featuring specific

paper investigates the potential of optimizing auto-regressive models for

optimization of text embeddings and fine-tuning of transformer layers. Our
experiments on the auto-regressive model demonstrate that this method achieves
comparable subject fidelity and prompt following to the leading diffusion-based

Abstract: Creating a photorealistic scene and human reconstruction from a single
monocular in-the-wild video figures prominently in the perception of a
human-centric 3D world. Recent neural rendering advances have enabled holistic
human-scene reconstruction but require pre-calibrated camera and human poses,
and days of training time. In this work, we introduce a novel unified framework
that simultaneously performs camera tracking, human pose estimation and
human-scene reconstruction in an online fashion. 3D Gaussian Splatting is
utilized to learn Gaussian primitives for humans and scenes efficiently, and
reconstruction-based camera tracking and human pose estimation modules are
designed to enable holistic understanding and effective disentanglement of pose
and appearance. Specifically, we design a human deformation module to
reconstruct the details and enhance generalizability to out-of-distribution
poses faithfully. Aiming to learn the spatial correlation between human and
scene accurately, we introduce occlusion-aware human silhouette rendering and
monocular geometric priors, which further improve reconstruction quality.
Experiments on the EMDB and NeuMan datasets demonstrate superior or on-par
performance with existing methods in camera tracking, human pose estimation,
novel view synthesis and runtime. Our project page is at

Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）在视觉理解方面表现出色，但常产生视觉幻觉，描述不存在的内容，这在安全关键应用中风险很大。现有方法要么依赖启发式调整生成，要么需要复杂的外部验证。

Method: REVERSE通过幻觉感知训练和实时自验证，利用包含130万半合成样本的数据集和推理时回顾重采样技术，动态检测和修正幻觉。

Conclusion: REVERSE提供了一个高效且统一的解决方案，显著提升了VLMs的可靠性，相关资源已开源。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at visual understanding but often suffer
from visual hallucinations, where they generate descriptions of nonexistent
objects, actions, or concepts, posing significant risks in safety-critical
applications. Existing hallucination mitigation methods typically follow one of
two paradigms: generation adjustment, which modifies decoding behavior to align
text with visual inputs, and post-hoc verification, where external models
assess and correct outputs. While effective, generation adjustment methods
often rely on heuristics and lack correction mechanisms, while post-hoc
verification is complicated, typically requiring multiple models and tending to
reject outputs rather than refine them. In this work, we introduce REVERSE, a
unified framework that integrates hallucination-aware training with on-the-fly
self-verification. By leveraging a new hallucination-verification dataset
containing over 1.3M semi-synthetic samples, along with a novel inference-time
retrospective resampling technique, our approach enables VLMs to both detect
hallucinations during generation and dynamically revise those hallucinations.
Our evaluations show that REVERSE achieves state-of-the-art hallucination
reduction, outperforming the best existing methods by up to 12% on CHAIR-MSCOCO

Abstract: This paper presents IMAGGarment-1, a fine-grained garment generation (FGG)
framework that enables high-fidelity garment synthesis with precise control
over silhouette, color, and logo placement. Unlike existing methods that are
limited to single-condition inputs, IMAGGarment-1 addresses the challenges of
multi-conditional controllability in personalized fashion design and digital
apparel applications. Specifically, IMAGGarment-1 employs a two-stage training
strategy to separately model global appearance and local details, while
enabling unified and controllable generation through end-to-end inference. In
the first stage, we propose a global appearance model that jointly encodes
silhouette and color using a mixed attention module and a color adapter. In the
second stage, we present a local enhancement model with an adaptive
appearance-aware module to inject user-defined logos and spatial constraints,
enabling accurate placement and visual consistency. To support this task, we
release GarmentBench, a large-scale dataset comprising over 180K garment
samples paired with multi-level design conditions, including sketches, color
references, logo placements, and textual prompts. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines, achieving superior
structural stability, color fidelity, and local controllability performance.

### [175] [Single-Shot Shape and Reflectance with Spatial Polarization Multiplexing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13177)
*Tomoki Ichikawa,Ryo Kawahara,Ko Nishino*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种空间偏振复用（SPM）方法，通过单次偏振图像重建物体形状和反射率，并应用于动态表面恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单模式结构光虽能实现单次形状重建，但反射率因缺乏入射光角度采样和投影模式与表面颜色纹理的纠缠而难以恢复。

Method: 设计了一种空间复用的偏振模式，通过量化AoLP值实现形状重建，同时利用局部区域的不同偏振光分离镜面和漫反射以估计BRDF。

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法可从单次偏振图像中恢复形状、穆勒矩阵和BRDF，并成功应用于动态表面。

Conclusion: SPM方法在保持自然表面外观的同时，实现了高效的单次形状和反射率重建。

Abstract: We propose spatial polarization multiplexing (SPM) for reconstructing object
shape and reflectance from a single polarimetric image and demonstrate its
application to dynamic surface recovery. Although single-pattern structured
light enables single-shot shape reconstruction, the reflectance is challenging
to recover due to the lack of angular sampling of incident light and the
entanglement of the projected pattern and the surface color texture. We design
a spatially multiplexed pattern of polarization that can be robustly and
uniquely decoded for shape reconstruction by quantizing the AoLP values. At the
same time, our spatial-multiplexing enables single-shot ellipsometry of linear
polarization by projecting differently polarized light within a local region,
which separates the specular and diffuse reflections for BRDF estimation. We
achieve this spatial polarization multiplexing with a constrained de Bruijn
sequence. Unlike single-pattern structured light with intensity and color, our
polarization pattern is invisible to the naked eye and retains the natural
surface appearance which is essential for accurate appearance modeling and also
interaction with people. We experimentally validate our method on real data.
The results show that our method can recover the shape, the Mueller matrix, and
the BRDF from a single-shot polarimetric image. We also demonstrate the
application of our method to dynamic surfaces.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种完全开放和可复现的感知语言模型（PLM）框架，用于透明研究图像和视频理解，避免依赖闭源模型蒸馏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高性能视觉语言模型多为闭源，阻碍科学进步。研究旨在通过开放框架和数据集推动透明研究。

Method: 分析标准训练流程，探索大规模合成数据，发布2.8M人工标注视频问答对和时空标注视频描述。

Result: 提出PLM-VideoBench评估套件，支持视频理解任务（如“什么”、“哪里”、“何时”、“如何”推理）。

Conclusion: 通过开放数据、训练方法、代码和模型，推动可复现的透明研究。

Abstract: Vision-language models are integral to computer vision research, yet many
high-performing models remain closed-source, obscuring their data, design and
training recipe. The research community has responded by using distillation
from black-box models to label training data, achieving strong benchmark
results, at the cost of measurable scientific progress. However, without
knowing the details of the teacher model and its data sources, scientific
progress remains difficult to measure. In this paper, we study building a
Perception Language Model (PLM) in a fully open and reproducible framework for
transparent research in image and video understanding. We analyze standard
training pipelines without distillation from proprietary models and explore
large-scale synthetic data to identify critical data gaps, particularly in
detailed video understanding. To bridge these gaps, we release 2.8M
human-labeled instances of fine-grained video question-answer pairs and
spatio-temporally grounded video captions. Additionally, we introduce
PLM-VideoBench, a suite for evaluating challenging video understanding tasks
focusing on the ability to reason about "what", "where", "when", and "how" of a
video. We make our work fully reproducible by providing data, training recipes,
code & models.

Motivation: 传统视觉编码器依赖多种预训练目标，针对特定任务设计。本文探索是否仅通过对比视觉-语言训练即可生成通用嵌入，简化预训练过程。

Method: 采用对比视觉-语言训练，结合两种对齐方法（语言对齐和空间对齐）提取隐藏的通用嵌入。

Result: PE模型在零样本分类、检索、问答及空间任务（如检测、深度估计和跟踪）中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，对比视觉-语言训练足以生成通用嵌入，PE模型在多项任务中表现优异，推动了相关研究。

Abstract: We introduce Perception Encoder (PE), a state-of-the-art encoder for image
and video understanding trained via simple vision-language learning.
Traditionally, vision encoders have relied on a variety of pretraining
objectives, each tailored to specific downstream tasks such as classification,
captioning, or localization. Surprisingly, after scaling our carefully tuned
image pretraining recipe and refining with our robust video data engine, we
find that contrastive vision-language training alone can produce strong,
general embeddings for all of these downstream tasks. There is only one caveat:
these embeddings are hidden within the intermediate layers of the network. To
draw them out, we introduce two alignment methods, language alignment for
multimodal language modeling, and spatial alignment for dense prediction.
Together with the core contrastive checkpoint, our PE family of models achieves
state-of-the-art performance on a wide variety of tasks, including zero-shot
image and video classification and retrieval; document, image, and video Q&A;
and spatial tasks such as detection, depth estimation, and tracking. To foster
further research, we are releasing our models, code, and a novel dataset of
synthetically and human-annotated videos.

### [178] [Interpretable AI-driven Guidelines for Type 2 Diabetes Treatment from Observational Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12417)
*Dewang Kumar Agarwal,Dimitris J. Bertsimas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于AI的树模型方法，用于制定2型糖尿病治疗指南，通过优化数据减少混杂偏差，并在实际测试中优于医生表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为2型糖尿病治疗提供精确、结构化且数据支持的治疗进展指南，适合临床采用。

Method: 使用波士顿医疗中心（1998-2014）的患者数据，通过机器学习和优化消除混杂偏差，训练树模型生成治疗建议，并在外部数据集上验证。

Result: 在未见的BMC患者中，模型的中位HbA1c降低比医生高0.26%；在外部数据集中高0.13%。

Conclusion: 这种AI支持的方法在2型糖尿病治疗中表现优异，具有可解释性和高效性，有望改善患者预后。

Abstract: Objective: Create precise, structured, data-backed guidelines for type 2
diabetes treatment progression, suitable for clinical adoption.
  Research Design and Methods: Our training cohort was composed of patient
(with type 2 diabetes) visits from Boston Medical Center (BMC) from 1998 to
2014. We divide visits into 4 groups based on the patient's treatment regimen
before the visit, and further divide them into subgroups based on the
recommended treatment during the visit. Since each subgroup has observational
data, which has confounding bias (sicker patients are prescribed more
aggressive treatments), we used machine learning and optimization to remove
some datapoints so that the remaining data resembles a randomized trial. On
each subgroup, we train AI-backed tree-based models to prescribe treatment
changes. Once we train these tree models, we manually combine the models for
every group to create an end-to-end prescription pipeline for all patients in
that group. In this process, we prioritize stepping up to a more aggressive
treatment before considering less aggressive options. We tested this pipeline
on unseen data from BMC, and an external dataset from Hartford healthcare (type
2 diabetes patient visits from January 2020 to May 2024).
  Results: The median HbA1c reduction achieved by our pipelines is 0.26% more
than what the doctors achieved on the unseen BMC patients. For the Hartford
cohort, our pipelines were better by 0.13%.
  Conclusions: This precise, interpretable, and efficient AI-backed approach to
treatment progression in type 2 diabetes is predicted to outperform the current
practice and can be deployed to improve patient outcomes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的对话代理系统，旨在增强人机协作在机器学习运维（MLOps）中的应用。通过Swarm Agent的可扩展架构，系统整合了多个专用代理，支持通过自然语言交互创建和管理ML工作流。

Result: 系统通过直观的对话界面，帮助用户发现、执行和监控ML管道，管理数据和访问文档，显著降低了使用门槛。

Conclusion: 该对话式MLOps助手有效降低了复杂性，为不同技术水平的用户提供了更易用的ML工具。

Abstract: This paper presents a Large Language Model (LLM) based conversational agent
system designed to enhance human-machine collaboration in Machine Learning
Operations (MLOps). We introduce the Swarm Agent, an extensible architecture
that integrates specialized agents to create and manage ML workflows through
natural language interactions. The system leverages a hierarchical, modular
design incorporating a KubeFlow Pipelines (KFP) Agent for ML pipeline
orchestration, a MinIO Agent for data management, and a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) Agent for domain-specific knowledge integration. Through
iterative reasoning loops and context-aware processing, the system enables
users with varying technical backgrounds to discover, execute, and monitor ML
pipelines; manage datasets and artifacts; and access relevant documentation,
all via intuitive conversational interfaces. Our approach addresses the
accessibility gap in complex MLOps platforms like Kubeflow, making advanced ML
tools broadly accessible while maintaining the flexibility to extend to other
platforms. The paper describes the architecture, implementation details, and
demonstrates how this conversational MLOps assistant reduces complexity and
lowers barriers to entry for users across diverse technical skill levels.

paradigm designed explicitly for seamless agent-platform interactions. This
article introduces Agentic AI Optimisation (AAIO) as an essential methodology
for ensuring effective integration between websites and agentic AI systems.
Like how Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) has shaped digital content
discoverability, AAIO can define interactions between autonomous AI agents and
online platforms. By examining the mutual interdependency between website
optimisation and agentic AI success, the article highlights the virtuous cycle
that AAIO can create. It further explores the governance, ethical, legal, and
social implications (GELSI) of AAIO, emphasising the necessity of proactive
regulatory frameworks to mitigate potential negative impacts. The article
concludes by affirming AAIO's essential role as part of a fundamental digital
infrastructure in the era of autonomous digital agents, advocating for
equitable and inclusive access to its benefits.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了开放世界中智能体如何应对超出其设计范围的新情境，提出了一种结合元知识和元推理的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放世界中的智能体常面临超出其经验或模型的情境，缺乏足够时间评估和行动，需要快速、合理的响应机制。

Method: 提出结合领域通用的元知识（受人类认知启发的评估）和元推理的新方法。

Result: 该方法有望为开放世界智能体提供快速、适应性强的响应，满足其性能需求。

Conclusion: 该研究为开放世界智能体的设计提供了新思路，强调了元知识和元推理的重要性。

Abstract: Regardless of past learning, an agent in an open world will face unfamiliar
situations and events outside of prior experience, existing models, or
policies. Further, the agent will sometimes lack relevant knowledge and/or
sufficient time to assess the situation, generate and evaluate options, and
pursue a robustly considered course of action. How can an agent respond
reasonably to situations that are outside of its original design scope? How can
it recognize such situations sufficiently quickly and reliably to determine
reasonable, adaptive courses of action? We identify key characteristics needed
for solutions, evaluate the state-of-the-art by these requirements, and outline
a proposed, novel approach that combines domain-general meta-knowledge (in the
form of appraisals inspired by human cognition) and metareasoning. It has the
potential to provide fast, adaptive responses to unfamiliar situations, more
fully meeting the performance characteristics required for open-world, general
agents.

TL;DR: 研究发现AI系统的可解释性与用户信任之间存在显著但中等强度的正相关关系，表明可解释性虽有助于建立信任，但并非唯一因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI可解释性是否真正提升用户信任，并揭示其社会技术意义。

Method: 采用元分析方法，综合分析了90项研究的数据。

Result: 可解释性与用户信任之间存在显著但中等强度的正相关关系。

Conclusion: 研究强调需关注AI系统的长期可信度，而非仅短期信任，同时需解决算法偏见和伦理透明等问题。

Abstract: This study critically examines the commonly held assumption that
explicability in artificial intelligence (AI) systems inherently boosts user
trust. Utilizing a meta-analytical approach, we conducted a comprehensive
examination of the existing literature to explore the relationship between AI
explainability and trust. Our analysis, incorporating data from 90 studies,
reveals a statistically significant but moderate positive correlation between
the explainability of AI systems and the trust they engender among users. This
indicates that while explainability contributes to building trust, it is not
the sole or predominant factor in this equation. In addition to academic
contributions to the field of Explainable AI (XAI), this research highlights
its broader socio-technical implications, particularly in promoting
accountability and fostering user trust in critical domains such as healthcare
and justice. By addressing challenges like algorithmic bias and ethical
transparency, the study underscores the need for equitable and sustainable AI
adoption. Rather than focusing solely on immediate trust, we emphasize the
normative importance of fostering authentic and enduring trustworthiness in AI
systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ZeroSumEval是一种基于零和游戏的动态评估协议，用于评估大语言模型（LLM）的能力，避免了传统方法的过拟合、高成本和偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估方法存在过拟合、高成本和偏见问题，需要一种动态且多样化的评估框架。

Method: 通过设计多样化的游戏（如安全挑战、经典游戏、知识测试和说服挑战），评估LLM的战略推理、规划、知识应用和创造力。

Result: 实验表明，前沿模型（如GPT和Claude）在常见游戏和问答中表现良好，但在需要创造力的任务中表现不佳。

Conclusion: ZeroSumEval提供了一个标准化且可扩展的评估框架，揭示了LLM在创造力任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Evaluating the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has traditionally
relied on static benchmark datasets, human assessments, or model-based
evaluations - methods that often suffer from overfitting, high costs, and
biases. ZeroSumEval is a novel competition-based evaluation protocol that
leverages zero-sum games to assess LLMs with dynamic benchmarks that resist
saturation. ZeroSumEval encompasses a diverse suite of games, including
security challenges (PyJail), classic games (Chess, Liar's Dice, Poker),
knowledge tests (MathQuiz), and persuasion challenges (Gandalf, Debate). These
games are designed to evaluate a range of AI capabilities such as strategic
reasoning, planning, knowledge application, and creativity. Building upon
recent studies that highlight the effectiveness of game-based evaluations for
LLMs, ZeroSumEval enhances these approaches by providing a standardized and
extensible framework. To demonstrate this, we conduct extensive experiments
with >7000 simulations across 7 games and 13 models. Our results show that
while frontier models from the GPT and Claude families can play common games
and answer questions, they struggle to play games that require creating novel
and challenging questions. We also observe that models cannot reliably
jailbreak each other and fail generally at tasks requiring creativity. We
release our code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/ZeroSumEval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI向多智能体协作发展，生成内容的来源变得复杂且难以追溯，需要一种方法来记录和归因多智能体的贡献。

Method: 提出了一种基于符号化时间戳记录（类似法医学中的保管链）的系统，通过反馈循环在生成过程中同步更新历史记录。

Result: 系统能够从生成内容本身追溯其历史，实现多智能体协作的透明化和可归因性。

Conclusion: 该研究为协作AI提供了一种可追溯的生成历史记录方法，有助于构建更负责任的AI生态系统。

Abstract: Provenance is the chronology of things, resonating with the fundamental
pursuit to uncover origins, trace connections, and situate entities within the
flow of space and time. As artificial intelligence advances towards autonomous
agents capable of interactive collaboration on complex tasks, the provenance of
generated content becomes entangled in the interplay of collective creation,
where contributions are continuously revised, extended or overwritten. In a
multi-agent generative chain, content undergoes successive transformations,
often leaving little, if any, trace of prior contributions. In this study, we
investigates the problem of tracking multi-agent provenance across the temporal
dimension of generation. We propose a chronological system for post hoc
attribution of generative history from content alone, without reliance on
internal memory states or external meta-information. At its core lies the
notion of symbolic chronicles, representing signed and time-stamped records, in
a form analogous to the chain of custody in forensic science. The system
operates through a feedback loop, whereby each generative timestep updates the
chronicle of prior interactions and synchronises it with the synthetic content
in the very act of generation. This research seeks to develop an accountable
form of collaborative artificial intelligence within evolving cyber ecosystems.

Conclusion: Embodied-R展示了高效推理潜力，并探讨了奖励设计、泛化差异等研究问题。

Abstract: Humans can perceive and reason about spatial relationships from sequential
visual observations, such as egocentric video streams. However, how pretrained
models acquire such abilities, especially high-level reasoning, remains
unclear. This paper introduces Embodied-R, a collaborative framework combining
large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for perception and small-scale
Language Models (LMs) for reasoning. Using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a
novel reward system considering think-answer logical consistency, the model
achieves slow-thinking capabilities with limited computational resources. After
training on only 5k embodied video samples, Embodied-R with a 3B LM matches
state-of-the-art multimodal reasoning models (OpenAI-o1, Gemini-2.5-pro) on
both in-distribution and out-of-distribution embodied spatial reasoning tasks.
Embodied-R also exhibits emergent thinking patterns such as systematic analysis
and contextual integration. We further explore research questions including
response length, training on VLM, strategies for reward design, and differences
in model generalization after SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) and RL training.

TL;DR: WebLists是一个包含200个数据提取任务的基准测试，用于评估网页代理在结构化数据提取中的表现。现有方法（如LLM和SOTA代理）表现不佳，而提出的BardeenAgent通过生成可重复程序并利用HTML结构，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网页代理研究主要关注导航和交易任务，而结构化数据提取任务的研究较少。WebLists基准测试填补了这一空白，并揭示了现有方法的不足。

Method: 提出BardeenAgent框架，将代理执行转化为可重复程序，利用HTML结构生成通用CSS选择器，并高效提取数据。

Result: BardeenAgent在WebLists基准测试中达到66%的召回率，是现有SOTA代理的两倍，且成本降低3倍。

Conclusion: BardeenAgent通过利用HTML结构和程序化方法，显著提升了网页代理在结构化数据提取任务中的性能和效率。

Abstract: Most recent web agent research has focused on navigation and transaction
tasks, with little emphasis on extracting structured data at scale. We present
WebLists, a benchmark of 200 data-extraction tasks across four common business
and enterprise use-cases. Each task requires an agent to navigate to a webpage,
configure it appropriately, and extract complete datasets with well-defined
schemas. We show that both LLMs with search capabilities and SOTA web agents
struggle with these tasks, with a recall of 3% and 31%, respectively, despite
higher performance on question-answering tasks.
  To address this challenge, we propose BardeenAgent, a novel framework that
enables web agents to convert their execution into repeatable programs, and
replay them at scale across pages with similar structure. BardeenAgent is also
the first LLM agent to take advantage of the regular structure of HTML. In
particular BardeenAgent constructs a generalizable CSS selector to capture all
relevant items on the page, then fits the operations to extract the data.
  On the WebLists benchmark, BardeenAgent achieves 66% recall overall, more
than doubling the performance of SOTA web agents, and reducing cost per output
row by 3x.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖TAO过程，但受限于LLM对复杂任务的知识不足，RAG提供了利用外部数据库增强生成的机会。

Method: 提出InstructRAG，包括组织历史指令路径的图、用于扩展覆盖的RL-Agent和用于任务泛化的ML-Agent，两者端到端训练。

Result: 在四个任务规划数据集上，InstructRAG性能显著提升，最高比现有方法提高19.2%。

Conclusion: InstructRAG通过多智能体框架有效解决了RAG在任务规划中的挑战，展现了高效适应新任务的能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their use as
agents for planning complex tasks. Existing methods typically rely on a
thought-action-observation (TAO) process to enhance LLM performance, but these
approaches are often constrained by the LLMs' limited knowledge of complex
tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers new opportunities by
leveraging external databases to ground generation in retrieved information. In
this paper, we identify two key challenges (enlargability and transferability)
in applying RAG to task planning. We propose InstructRAG, a novel solution
within a multi-agent meta-reinforcement learning framework, to address these
challenges. InstructRAG includes a graph to organize past instruction paths
(sequences of correct actions), an RL-Agent with Reinforcement Learning to
expand graph coverage for enlargability, and an ML-Agent with Meta-Learning to
improve task generalization for transferability. The two agents are trained
end-to-end to optimize overall planning performance. Our experiments on four
widely used task planning datasets demonstrate that InstructRAG significantly
enhances performance and adapts efficiently to new tasks, achieving up to a
19.2% improvement over the best existing approach.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为EEF的方法，通过利用专家失败轨迹中的有益动作来提升LLM代理的性能，显著解决了复杂子任务，并在WebShop和SciWorld中取得了新的最佳表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如RFT）在复杂子任务上表现不佳，而专家失败轨迹中的有益动作可能提供关键指导。

Method: EEF方法从专家失败轨迹中提取有益动作并整合到训练数据中，同时排除有害动作。

Result: EEF在WebShop中的胜率达到62%，超过RFT（53.6%）和GPT-4（35.6%），并在SciWorld中首次突破81分。

Conclusion: EEF通过利用专家失败轨迹中的有益动作，显著提升了LLM代理的性能，解决了复杂子任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tremendous potential as agents,
excelling at tasks that require multiple rounds of reasoning and interactions.
Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as an effective method for
finetuning LLMs as agents: it first imitates expert-generated successful
trajectories and further improves agentic skills through iterative fine-tuning
on successful, self-generated trajectories. However, since the expert (e.g.,
GPT-4) succeeds primarily on simpler subtasks and RFT inherently favors simpler
scenarios, many complex subtasks remain unsolved and persistently
out-of-distribution (OOD). Upon investigating these challenging subtasks, we
discovered that previously failed expert trajectories can often provide
valuable guidance, e.g., plans and key actions, that can significantly improve
agent exploration efficiency and acquisition of critical skills. Motivated by
these observations, we propose Exploring Expert Failures (EEF), which
identifies beneficial actions from failed expert trajectories and integrates
them into the training dataset. Potentially harmful actions are meticulously
excluded to prevent contamination of the model learning process. By leveraging
the beneficial actions in expert failures, EEF successfully solves some
previously unsolvable subtasks and improves agent tuning performance.
Remarkably, our approach achieved a 62\% win rate in WebShop, outperforming RFT
(53. 6\%) and GPT-4 (35. 6\%), and to the best of our knowledge, setting a new
state-of-the-art as the first method to surpass a score of 0.81 in WebShop and
exceed 81 in SciWorld.

Abstract: Frontier models that generate extended reasoning traces inadvertently produce
rich token sequences that can facilitate model distillation. Recognizing this
vulnerability, model owners may seek sampling strategies that limit the
effectiveness of distillation without compromising model performance.
\emph{Antidistillation sampling} provides exactly this capability. By
strategically modifying a model's next-token probability distribution,
antidistillation sampling poisons reasoning traces, rendering them
significantly less effective for distillation while preserving the model's
practical utility. For further details, see https://antidistillation.com.

Abstract: Creating responsible artificial intelligence (AI) systems is an important
issue in contemporary research and development of works on AI. One of the
characteristics of responsible AI systems is their explainability. In the
paper, we are interested in explainable deep learning (XDL) systems. On the
basis of the creation of digital twins of physical objects, we introduce the
idea of creating readable twins (in the form of imprecise information flow
models) for unreadable deep learning models. The complete procedure for
switching from the deep learning model (DLM) to the imprecise information flow
model (IIFM) is presented. The proposed approach is illustrated with an example
of a deep learning classification model for image recognition of handwritten
digits from the MNIST data set.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“sleep-time compute”的方法，通过离线预计算用户可能提出的查询，显著减少测试时的计算需求，并提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在测试时高延迟和高计算成本的问题。

Method: 引入sleep-time compute，预计算用户可能提出的查询；在Stateful GSM-Symbolic和Stateful AIME任务上验证；扩展为Multi-Query GSM-Symbolic以分摊成本。

Result: 测试时计算需求减少5倍，准确性提升13%-18%；Multi-Query GSM-Symbolic使单查询成本降低2.5倍。

Conclusion: sleep-time compute在查询可预测性高时效果显著，适用于实际任务如代理软件工程任务。

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute has emerged as a key ingredient for enabling large
language models (LLMs) to solve difficult problems, but comes with high latency
and inference cost. We introduce sleep-time compute, which allows models to
"think" offline about contexts before queries are presented: by anticipating
what queries users might ask and pre-computing useful quantities, we can
significantly reduce the compute requirements at test-time. To demonstrate the
efficacy of our method, we create modified versions of two reasoning tasks -
Stateful GSM-Symbolic and Stateful AIME. We find that sleep-time compute can
reduce the amount of test-time compute needed to achieve the same accuracy by ~
5x on Stateful GSM-Symbolic and Stateful AIME and that by scaling sleep-time
compute we can further increase accuracy by up to 13% on Stateful GSM-Symbolic
and 18% on Stateful AIME. Furthermore, we introduce Multi-Query GSM-Symbolic,
which extends GSM-Symbolic by including multiple related queries per context.
By amortizing sleep-time compute across related queries about the same context
using Multi-Query GSM-Symbolic, we can decrease the average cost per query by
2.5x. We then conduct additional analysis to understand when sleep-time compute
is most effective, finding the predictability of the user query to be well
correlated with the efficacy of sleep-time compute. Finally, we conduct a
case-study of applying sleep-time compute to a realistic agentic SWE task.

Motivation: 理解MoE LLMs中专家协作机制以提升模型可解释性和优化效果。

Method: 提出HSDL方法分析专家协作模式，并设计CAEP算法修剪低贡献专家。

Result: 协作模式与输入类型相关，CAEP算法平均提升性能2.5%。

Conclusion: 研究为MoE LLMs的效率和可解释性提供了新见解，优化了模型性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts based large language models (MoE LLMs) have shown
significant promise in multitask adaptability by dynamically routing inputs to
specialized experts. Despite their success, the collaborative mechanisms among
experts are still not well understood, limiting both the interpretability and
optimization of these models. In this paper, we focus on two critical issues:
(1) identifying expert collaboration patterns, and (2) optimizing MoE LLMs
through expert pruning. To address the first issue, we propose a hierarchical
sparse dictionary learning (HSDL) method that uncovers the collaboration
patterns among experts. For the second issue, we introduce the
Contribution-Aware Expert Pruning (CAEP) algorithm, which effectively prunes
low-contribution experts. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that expert
collaboration patterns are closely linked to specific input types and exhibit
semantic significance across various tasks. Moreover, pruning experiments show
that our approach improves overall performance by 2.5\% on average,
outperforming existing methods. These findings offer valuable insights into
enhancing the efficiency and interpretability of MoE LLMs, offering a clearer
understanding of expert interactions and improving model optimization.

TL;DR: aLoRA（Activated LoRA）是一种改进的LoRA框架，旨在解决多轮设置中切换LoRA的低效问题，通过仅对调用后的令牌进行权重调整，避免重新计算KV缓存。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在多轮设置中切换效率低下，需要重新计算整个历史记录的KV缓存，影响了生成速度。

Method: 提出aLoRA，仅对调用后的令牌进行权重调整，保留基础模型的KV缓存，实现即时激活。

Result: aLoRA在保持与标准LoRA竞争性准确度的同时，显著提升了推理效率。

Conclusion: aLoRA为构建高度专业化的模型（intrinsics）提供了高效解决方案，适用于多轮对话或输入链的特定操作。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly efficient framework for
finetuning the weights of large foundation models, and has become the go-to
method for data-driven customization of LLMs. Despite the promise of highly
customized behaviors and capabilities, switching between relevant LoRAs in a
multiturn setting is highly inefficient, as the key-value (KV) cache of the
entire turn history must be recomputed with the LoRA weights before generation
can begin. To address this problem, we propose Activated LoRA (aLoRA), which
modifies the LoRA framework to only adapt weights for the tokens in the
sequence \emph{after} the aLoRA is invoked. This change crucially allows aLoRA
to accept the base model's KV cache of the input string, meaning that aLoRA can
be instantly activated whenever needed in a chain without recomputing the
cache. This enables building what we call \emph{intrinsics}, i.e. highly
specialized models invoked to perform well-defined operations on portions of an
input chain or conversation that otherwise uses the base model by default. We
use aLoRA to train a set of intrinsics models, demonstrating competitive
accuracy with standard LoRA while achieving significant inference benefits.

Result: 实证评估表明，该方法在平衡性和权重选择上优于传统手动方法。

Conclusion: 统一目标尺度的方法在多目标QUBO优化中具有显著优势，解决了手动权重选择的繁琐问题。

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization involving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary
Optimization (QUBO) problems arises in various domains. A fundamental challenge
in this context is the effective balancing of multiple objectives, each
potentially operating on very different scales. This imbalance introduces
complications such as the selection of appropriate weights when scalarizing
multiple objectives into a single objective function. In this paper, we propose
a novel technique for scaling QUBO objectives that uses an exact computation of
the variance of each individual QUBO objective. By scaling each objective to
have unit variance, we align all objectives onto a common scale, thereby
allowing for more balanced solutions to be found when scalarizing the
objectives with equal weights, as well as potentially assisting in the search
or choice of weights during scalarization. Finally, we demonstrate its
advantages through empirical evaluations on various multi-objective
optimization problems. Our results are noteworthy since manually selecting
scalarization weights is cumbersome, and reliable, efficient solutions are
scarce.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force across
industries, driven by advances in deep learning and natural language
processing, and fueled by large-scale data and computing resources. Despite its
rapid adoption, the opacity of AI systems poses significant challenges to trust
and acceptance.
  This work explores the intersection of connectionist and symbolic approaches
to artificial intelligence, focusing on the derivation of interpretable
symbolic models, such as decision trees, from feedforward neural networks
(FNNs). Decision trees provide a transparent framework for elucidating the
operations of neural networks while preserving their functionality. The
derivation is presented in a step-by-step approach and illustrated with several
examples. A systematic methodology is proposed to bridge neural and symbolic
paradigms by exploiting distributed representations in FNNs to identify
symbolic components, including fillers, roles, and their interrelationships.
The process traces neuron activation values and input configurations across
network layers, mapping activations and their underlying inputs to decision
tree edges. The resulting symbolic structures effectively capture FNN decision
processes and enable scalability to deeper networks through iterative
refinement of subpaths for each hidden layer.
  To validate the theoretical framework, a prototype was developed using Keras
.h5-data and emulating TensorFlow within the Java JDK/JavaFX environment. This
prototype demonstrates the feasibility of extracting symbolic representations
from neural networks, enhancing trust in AI systems, and promoting
accountability.

Conclusion: Moran特征向量在正空间自相关情况下效果有限，但在负自相关或网络自相关中仍有价值。

Abstract: Moran Eigenvector Spatial Filtering (ESF) approaches have shown promise in
accounting for spatial effects in statistical models. Can this extend to
machine learning? This paper examines the effectiveness of using Moran
Eigenvectors as additional spatial features in machine learning models. We
generate synthetic datasets with known processes involving spatially varying
and nonlinear effects across two different geometries. Moran Eigenvectors
calculated from different spatial weights matrices, with and without a priori
eigenvector selection, are tested. We assess the performance of popular machine
learning models, including Random Forests, LightGBM, XGBoost, and TabNet, and
benchmark their accuracies in terms of cross-validated R2 values against models
that use only coordinates as features. We also extract coefficients and
functions from the models using GeoShapley and compare them with the true
processes. Results show that machine learning models using only location
coordinates achieve better accuracies than eigenvector-based approaches across
various experiments and datasets. Furthermore, we discuss that while these
findings are relevant for spatial processes that exhibit positive spatial
autocorrelation, they do not necessarily apply when modeling network
autocorrelation and cases with negative spatial autocorrelation, where Moran
Eigenvectors would still be useful.

Conclusion: 提出的最小-最大原始-对偶梯度提升算法是一种灵活且强大的公平性解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, fairness in machine learning has emerged as a critical
concern to ensure that developed and deployed predictive models do not have
disadvantageous predictions for marginalized groups. It is essential to
mitigate discrimination against individuals based on protected attributes such
as gender and race. In this work, we consider applying subgroup justice
concepts to gradient-boosting machines designed for supervised learning
problems. Our approach expanded gradient-boosting methodologies to explore a
broader range of objective functions, which combines conventional losses such
as the ones from classification and regression and a min-max fairness term. We
study relevant theoretical properties of the solution of the min-max
optimization problem. The optimization process explored the primal-dual
problems at each boosting round. This generic framework can be adapted to
diverse fairness concepts. The proposed min-max primal-dual gradient boosting
algorithm was theoretically shown to converge under mild conditions and
empirically shown to be a powerful and flexible approach to address binary and
subgroup fairness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE训练中稀疏的梯度更新导致训练不稳定和性能不佳，需要一种方法在不增加计算开销的情况下改善这一问题。

Method: 提出Default MoE，用专家输出的指数移动平均替代缺失的激活，使路由器能接收每个专家的信号。

Result: Default MoE在多种设置下优于标准TopK路由，且计算开销无明显增加。

Conclusion: Default MoE是一种轻量级方法，显著提升了MoE的训练性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) pretraining is more scalable than dense Transformer
pretraining, because MoEs learn to route inputs to a sparse set of their
feedforward parameters. However, this means that MoEs only receive a sparse
backward update, leading to training instability and suboptimal performance. We
present a lightweight approximation method that gives the MoE router a dense
gradient update while continuing to sparsely activate its parameters. Our
method, which we refer to as Default MoE, substitutes missing expert
activations with default outputs consisting of an exponential moving average of
expert outputs previously seen over the course of training. This allows the
router to receive signals from every expert for each token, leading to
significant improvements in training performance. Our Default MoE outperforms
standard TopK routing in a variety of settings without requiring significant
computational overhead. Code: https://github.com/vatsal0/default-moe.

Abstract: The intersection of deep learning and symbolic mathematics has seen rapid
progress in recent years, exemplified by the work of Lample and Charton. They
demonstrated that effective training of machine learning models for solving
mathematical problems critically depends on high-quality, domain-specific
datasets. In this paper, we address the computation of Gr\"obner basis using
Transformers. While a dataset generation method tailored to Transformer-based
Gr\"obner basis computation has previously been proposed, it lacked theoretical
guarantees regarding the generality or quality of the generated datasets. In
this work, we prove that datasets generated by the previously proposed
algorithm are sufficiently general, enabling one to ensure that Transformers
can learn a sufficiently diverse range of Gr\"obner bases. Moreover, we propose
an extended and generalized algorithm to systematically construct datasets of
ideal generators, further enhancing the training effectiveness of Transformer.
Our results provide a rigorous geometric foundation for Transformers to address
a mathematical problem, which is an answer to Lample and Charton's idea of
training on diverse or representative inputs.

Conclusion: D2FT是一种高效的基础模型微调框架，显著降低成本且对准确性影响小，适用于参数高效的微调技术。

Abstract: Fine-tuning plays a crucial role in adapting models to downstream tasks with
minimal training efforts. However, the rapidly increasing size of foundation
models poses a daunting challenge for accommodating foundation model
fine-tuning in most commercial devices, which often have limited memory
bandwidth. Techniques like model sharding and tensor parallelism address this
issue by distributing computation across multiple devices to meet memory
requirements. Nevertheless, these methods do not fully leverage their
foundation nature in facilitating the fine-tuning process, resulting in high
computational costs and imbalanced workloads. We introduce a novel Distributed
Dynamic Fine-Tuning (D2FT) framework that strategically orchestrates operations
across attention modules based on our observation that not all attention
modules are necessary for forward and backward propagation in fine-tuning
foundation models. Through three innovative selection strategies, D2FT
significantly reduces the computational workload required for fine-tuning
foundation models. Furthermore, D2FT addresses workload imbalances in
distributed computing environments by optimizing these selection strategies via
multiple knapsack optimization. Our experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed D2FT framework reduces the training computational costs by 40% and
training communication costs by 50% with only 1% to 2% accuracy drops on the
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Stanford Cars datasets. Moreover, the results show
that D2FT can be effectively extended to recent LoRA, a state-of-the-art
parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique. By reducing 40% computational cost
or 50% communication cost, D2FT LoRA top-1 accuracy only drops 4% to 6% on
Stanford Cars dataset.

Result: 初步结果显示，现有CL方法优于基线，尤其是Replay策略在减少训练时间的同时性能接近完全重训练。

Conclusion: 持续学习在工程设计中具有潜力，Replay策略尤其适合实际应用。代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Engineering problems that apply machine learning often involve
computationally intensive methods but rely on limited datasets. As engineering
data evolves with new designs and constraints, models must incorporate new
knowledge over time. However, high computational costs make retraining models
from scratch infeasible. Continual learning (CL) offers a promising solution by
enabling models to learn from sequential data while mitigating catastrophic
forgetting, where a model forgets previously learned mappings. This work
introduces CL to engineering design by benchmarking several CL methods on
representative regression tasks. We apply these strategies to five engineering
datasets and construct nine new engineering CL benchmarks to evaluate their
ability to address forgetting and improve generalization. Preliminary results
show that applying existing CL methods to these tasks improves performance over
naive baselines. In particular, the Replay strategy achieved performance
comparable to retraining in several benchmarks while reducing training time by
nearly half, demonstrating its potential for real-world engineering workflows.

<details>

Motivation: 长上下文语言模型在推理时GPU内存需求高，部署困难，需要一种内存高效的方法。

Method: 将关键层分割为“迷你序列”，结合KV缓存卸载技术。

Result: MOM平均减少50%以上的峰值内存使用，在Meta-Llama-3.2-8B上将最大上下文长度从155k扩展到455k令牌，且不损失准确性。

Conclusion: MOM解决了推理中的内存瓶颈，将研究重点从预填充阶段优化转向解码阶段的KV缓存效率提升。

Abstract: Long-context language models exhibit impressive performance but remain
challenging to deploy due to high GPU memory demands during inference. We
propose Memory-efficient Offloaded Mini-sequence Inference (MOM), a method that
partitions critical layers into smaller "mini-sequences" and integrates
seamlessly with KV cache offloading. Experiments on various Llama, Qwen, and
Mistral models demonstrate that MOM reduces peak memory usage by over 50\% on
average. On Meta-Llama-3.2-8B, MOM extends the maximum context length from 155k
to 455k tokens on a single A100 80GB GPU, while keeping outputs identical and
not compromising accuracy. MOM also maintains highly competitive throughput due
to minimal computational overhead and efficient last-layer processing. Compared
to traditional chunked prefill methods, MOM achieves a 35\% greater context
length extension. More importantly, our method drastically reduces prefill
memory consumption, eliminating it as the longstanding dominant memory
bottleneck during inference. This breakthrough fundamentally changes research
priorities, redirecting future efforts from prefill-stage optimizations to
improving decode-stage residual KV cache efficiency.

Method: 利用物理学启发的路径积分方法，分析欠参数化和过参数化扩散模型的学习分布。

Result: 发现扩散模型学习到的分布类似于训练分布但填补了“空白”，这种归纳偏差源于训练中噪声目标的协方差结构。

Conclusion: 噪声目标的协方差结构是扩散模型泛化的关键因素，并与特征相关的归纳偏差相互作用。

Abstract: How diffusion models generalize beyond their training set is not known, and
is somewhat mysterious given two facts: the optimum of the denoising score
matching (DSM) objective usually used to train diffusion models is the score
function of the training distribution; and the networks usually used to learn
the score function are expressive enough to learn this score to high accuracy.
We claim that a certain feature of the DSM objective -- the fact that its
target is not the training distribution's score, but a noisy quantity only
equal to it in expectation -- strongly impacts whether and to what extent
diffusion models generalize. In this paper, we develop a mathematical theory
that partly explains this 'generalization through variance' phenomenon. Our
theoretical analysis exploits a physics-inspired path integral approach to
compute the distributions typically learned by a few paradigmatic under- and
overparameterized diffusion models. We find that the distributions diffusion
models effectively learn to sample from resemble their training distributions,
but with 'gaps' filled in, and that this inductive bias is due to the
covariance structure of the noisy target used during training. We also
characterize how this inductive bias interacts with feature-related inductive
biases.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能有效满足未知安全定义，并适用于各种连续控制任务。

Conclusion: 该方法通过从稀疏数据中学习安全模型，解决了安全强化学习中安全约束未知的问题。

Abstract: In safe reinforcement learning (RL), auxiliary safety costs are used to align
the agent to safe decision making. In practice, safety constraints, including
cost functions and budgets, are unknown or hard to specify, as it requires
anticipation of all possible unsafe behaviors. We therefore address a general
setting where the true safety definition is unknown, and has to be learned from
sparsely labeled data. Our key contributions are: first, we design a safety
model that performs credit assignment to estimate each decision step's impact
on the overall safety using a dataset of diverse trajectories and their
corresponding binary safety labels (i.e., whether the corresponding trajectory
is safe/unsafe). Second, we illustrate the architecture of our safety model to
demonstrate its ability to learn a separate safety score for each timestep.
Third, we reformulate the safe RL problem using the proposed safety model and
derive an effective algorithm to optimize a safe yet rewarding policy. Finally,
our empirical results corroborate our findings and show that this approach is
effective in satisfying unknown safety definition, and scalable to various
continuous control tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合全球数据预训练和本地数据微调的方法，以提高洪水预测模型的性能，尤其是在全球训练中表现不佳的流域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全球训练模型在本地应用中的所有权问题和性能不足，同时利用本地数据提升预测准确性。

Method: 预训练模型于全球数据集，再通过本地流域数据进行微调。

Result: 性能显著提升，尤其是在全球训练中表现较差的流域。

Conclusion: 为本地机构提供了一种将全球模型本地化的方法，降低机器学习水文预测系统的部署门槛。

Abstract: Floods are the most common form of natural disaster and accurate flood
forecasting is essential for early warning systems. Previous work has shown
that machine learning (ML) models are a promising way to improve flood
predictions when trained on large, geographically-diverse datasets. This
requirement of global training can result in a loss of ownership for national
forecasters who cannot easily adapt the models to improve performance in their
region, preventing ML models from being operationally deployed. Furthermore,
traditional hydrology research with physics-based models suggests that local
data -- which in many cases is only accessible to local agencies -- is valuable
for improving model performance. To address these concerns, we demonstrate a
methodology of pre-training a model on a large, global dataset and then
fine-tuning that model on data from individual basins. This results in
performance increases, validating our hypothesis that there is extra
information to be captured in local data. In particular, we show that
performance increases are most significant in watersheds that underperform
during global training. We provide a roadmap for national forecasters who wish
to take ownership of global models using their own data, aiming to lower the
barrier to operational deployment of ML-based hydrological forecast systems.

Motivation: 解决 Hebbian 学习在 Hopfield 网络中的容量限制问题，同时提升学习效率。

Method: 采用 Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) 方法，通过闭式解非迭代学习对偶变量。

Result: KRR 实现了与 KLR 相似的高存储容量（比例达 1.5）和噪声鲁棒性（从约 80% 损坏模式中恢复），同时大幅减少训练时间。

Conclusion: KRR 是一种高效构建高性能联想记忆的方法。

Abstract: Hebbian learning limits Hopfield network capacity. While kernel methods like
Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) improve performance via iterative learning, we

80% corrupted patterns) as KLR, while drastically reducing training time,
establishing KRR as an efficient method for building high-performance
associative memories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 策略梯度方法在利用方面表现优异，但探索能力不足；进化计算方法擅长全局探索，但缺乏利用机制。EPO旨在结合两者的优势。

Method: EPO整合了神经进化和策略梯度方法，利用EC的探索能力和PG的利用能力。

Result: 在Atari Pong和Breakout基准测试中，EPO在策略质量和样本效率上均优于标准PG和EC方法。

Conclusion: EPO有效解决了强化学习中探索与利用的权衡问题，适用于需要全局探索和局部优化的任务。

Abstract: A key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is managing the
exploration-exploitation trade-off without sacrificing sample efficiency.
Policy gradient (PG) methods excel in exploitation through fine-grained,
gradient-based optimization but often struggle with exploration due to their
focus on local search. In contrast, evolutionary computation (EC) methods excel
in global exploration, but lack mechanisms for exploitation. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes Evolutionary Policy Optimization (EPO), a
hybrid algorithm that integrates neuroevolution with policy gradient methods
for policy optimization. EPO leverages the exploration capabilities of EC and
the exploitation strengths of PG, offering an efficient solution to the
exploration-exploitation dilemma in RL. EPO is evaluated on the Atari Pong and
Breakout benchmarks. Experimental results show that EPO improves both policy
quality and sample efficiency compared to standard PG and EC methods, making it
effective for tasks that require both exploration and local optimization.

TL;DR: MagMatch是一种新型的开放集半监督学习框架，通过原型对比学习自然隔离OOD样本，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有OSSL方法在处理未标记数据时因排除、干扰或过度信任OOD样本而导致特征空间次优的问题。

Method: 采用原型对比学习范式，通过ID-Selective Magnetic模块选择性对齐ID样本，同时允许OOD样本保持未对齐状态，并使用SMA损失动态调整对齐。

Result: 在多个数据集上，MagMatch在封闭集分类准确率和OOD检测AUROC上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MagMatch通过自然隔离OOD样本和动态调整对齐策略，有效提升了开放集半监督学习的性能。

Abstract: Open-Set Semi-Supervised Learning (OSSL) tackles the practical challenge of
learning from unlabeled data that may include both in-distribution (ID) and
unknown out-of-distribution (OOD) classes. However, existing OSSL methods form
suboptimal feature spaces by either excluding OOD samples, interfering with
them, or overtrusting their information during training. In this work, we
introduce MagMatch, a novel framework that naturally isolates OOD samples
through a prototype-based contrastive learning paradigm. Unlike conventional
methods, MagMatch does not assign any prototypes to OOD samples; instead, it
selectively aligns ID samples with class prototypes using an ID-Selective
Magnetic (ISM) module, while allowing OOD samples - the "others" - to remain
unaligned in the feature space. To support this process, we propose Selective
Magnetic Alignment (SMA) loss for unlabeled data, which dynamically adjusts
alignment based on sample confidence. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets
demonstrate that MagMatch significantly outperforms existing methods in both
closed-set classification accuracy and OOD detection AUROC, especially in
generalizing to unseen OOD data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FedDua的新方法，通过梯度预测客户端数据量，解决联邦学习中加权平均方法因数据量不准确导致的模型偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习中使用数据量加权平均的方法容易因客户端虚假报告数据量而产生模型偏差，需要一种更可靠的聚合方法。

Method: 提出FedDua方法，通过客户端上传的本地模型梯度预测其真实数据量，并集成到现有联邦学习算法中。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，FedDua在客户端数据量声明不准确的情况下，平均提升全局模型性能3.17%。

Conclusion: FedDua是一种有效且通用的联邦学习聚合方法，能够显著提升模型性能并减少偏差。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training of deep learning
models without requiring data to leave local clients, thereby preserving client
privacy. The aggregation process on the server plays a critical role in the
performance of the resulting FL model. The most commonly used aggregation
method is weighted averaging based on the amount of data from each client,
which is thought to reflect each client's contribution. However, this method is
prone to model bias, as dishonest clients might report inaccurate training data
volumes to the server, which is hard to verify. To address this issue, we
propose a novel secure \underline{Fed}erated \underline{D}ata
q\underline{u}antity-\underline{a}ware weighted averaging method (FedDua). It
enables FL servers to accurately predict the amount of training data from each
client based on their local model gradients uploaded. Furthermore, it can be
seamlessly integrated into any FL algorithms that involve server-side model
aggregation. Extensive experiments on three benchmarking datasets demonstrate
that FedDua improves the global model performance by an average of 3.17%
compared to four popular FL aggregation methods in the presence of inaccurate
client data volume declarations.

Conclusion: ChemKANs展示了在燃烧物理和化学动力学中的潜力，并验证了KAN-ODEs在更大规模问题中的可扩展性。

Abstract: Efficient chemical kinetic model inference and application for combustion
problems is challenging due to large ODE systems and wideley separated time
scales. Machine learning techniques have been proposed to streamline these
models, though strong nonlinearity and numerical stiffness combined with noisy
data sources makes their application challenging. The recently developed
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and KAN ordinary differential equations
(KAN-ODEs) have been demonstrated as powerful tools for scientific applications
thanks to their rapid neural scaling, improved interpretability, and smooth
activation functions. Here, we develop ChemKANs by augmenting the KAN-ODE
framework with physical knowledge of the flow of information through the
relevant kinetic and thermodynamic laws, as well as an elemental conservation
loss term. This novel framework encodes strong inductive bias that enables
streamlined training and higher accuracy predictions, while facilitating
parameter sparsity through full sharing of information across all inputs and
outputs. In a model inference investigation, we find that ChemKANs exhibit no
overfitting or model degradation when tasked with extracting predictive models
from data that is both sparse and noisy, a task that a standard DeepONet
struggles to accomplish. Next, we find that a remarkably parameter-lean ChemKAN
(only 344 parameters) can accurately represent hydrogen combustion chemistry,
providing a 2x acceleration over the detailed chemistry in a solver that is
generalizable to larger-scale turbulent flow simulations. These demonstrations
indicate potential for ChemKANs in combustion physics and chemical kinetics,
and demonstrate the scalability of generic KAN-ODEs in significantly larger and
more numerically challenging problems than previously studied.

Result: 实验表明GroupCART无需数据转换即可生成更公平的模型，且性能损失很小，支持自定义权重。

Conclusion: 通过多任务公平感知学习，可以减轻决策树模型中的算法偏差。

Abstract: Discrimination-aware classification aims to make accurate predictions while
satisfying fairness constraints. Traditional decision tree learners typically
optimize for information gain in the target attribute alone, which can result
in models that unfairly discriminate against protected social groups (e.g.,
gender, ethnicity). Motivated by these shortcomings, we propose GroupCART, a
tree-based ensemble optimizer that avoids bias during model construction by
optimizing not only for decreased entropy in the target attribute but also for
increased entropy in protected attributes. Our experiments show that GroupCART
achieves fairer models without data transformation and with minimal performance
degradation. Furthermore, the method supports customizable weighting, offering
a smooth and flexible trade-off between predictive performance and fairness
based on user requirements. These results demonstrate that algorithmic bias in
decision tree models can be mitigated through multi-task, fairness-aware
learning. All code and datasets used in this study are available at:

Motivation: 现有图Transformer架构复杂，难以利用Transformer的训练进展，因此需简化设计。

Method: 1. 使用简化的L2注意力；2. 自适应均方根归一化；3. 共享编码器的相对位置编码偏置。

Result: 在多种图数据集上表现显著提升，并在图同构测试中展现出强大表达能力。

Conclusion: 通过简单修改，普通Transformer可有效应用于图学习，且性能优越。

Abstract: Transformers have attained outstanding performance across various modalities,
employing scaled-dot-product (SDP) attention mechanisms. Researchers have
attempted to migrate Transformers to graph learning, but most advanced Graph
Transformers are designed with major architectural differences, either
integrating message-passing or incorporating sophisticated attention
mechanisms. These complexities prevent the easy adoption of Transformer
training advances. We propose three simple modifications to the plain
Transformer to render it applicable to graphs without introducing major
architectural distortions. Specifically, we advocate for the use of (1)
simplified $L_2$ attention to measure the magnitude closeness of tokens; (2)
adaptive root-mean-square normalization to preserve token magnitude
information; and (3) a relative positional encoding bias with a shared encoder.
Significant performance gains across a variety of graph datasets justify the
effectiveness of our proposed modifications. Furthermore, empirical evaluation
on the expressiveness benchmark reveals noteworthy realized expressiveness in
the graph isomorphism.

Conclusion: BetaConform为LLM集成判断提供了一种高效、精确且理论保证的性能评估框架。

Abstract: LLM ensembles are widely used for LLM judges. However, how to estimate their
accuracy, especially in an efficient way, is unknown. In this paper, we present
a principled maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework for an economical and precise
estimation of the performance of LLM ensemble judgment. We first propose a
mixture of Beta-Binomial distributions to model the judgment distribution,
revising from the vanilla Binomial distribution. Next, we introduce a conformal
prediction-driven approach that enables adaptive stopping during iterative
sampling to balance accuracy with efficiency. Furthermore, we design a prior
transfer mechanism that utilizes learned distributions on open-source datasets
to improve estimation on a target dataset when only scarce annotations are
available. Finally, we present BetaConform, a framework that integrates our
distribution assumption, adaptive stopping, and the prior transfer mechanism to
deliver a theoretically guaranteed distribution estimation of LLM ensemble
judgment with minimum labeled samples. BetaConform is also validated
empirically. For instance, with only 10 samples from the TruthfulQA dataset,
for a Llama ensembled judge, BetaConform gauges its performance with error
margin as small as 3.37%.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了条件独立性之间的“元依赖性”对因果发现算法的影响，为改进算法提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Constraint-based causal discovery algorithms utilize many statistical tests
for conditional independence to uncover networks of causal dependencies. These
approaches to causal discovery rely on an assumed correspondence between the
graphical properties of a causal structure and the conditional independence
properties of observed variables, known as the causal Markov condition and
faithfulness. Finite data yields an empirical distribution that is "close" to
the actual distribution. Across these many possible empirical distributions,
the correspondence to the graphical properties can break down for different
conditional independencies, and multiple violations can occur at the same time.
We study this "meta-dependence" between conditional independence properties
using the following geometric intuition: each conditional independence property
constrains the space of possible joint distributions to a manifold. The
"meta-dependence" between conditional independences is informed by the position
of these manifolds relative to the true probability distribution. We provide a
simple-to-compute measure of this meta-dependence using information projections
and consolidate our findings empirically using both synthetic and real-world
data.

Method: 采用停止时间方法，分析SGD在非凸设置下的收敛性，放宽步长和高阶矩假设。

Result: 证明了SGD在更宽松条件下的几乎必然收敛和L2收敛。

Conclusion: 新框架显著放宽假设，增强了理论结果的普适性和实用性。

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is widely used in machine learning
research. Previous convergence analyses of SGD under the vanishing step-size
setting typically require Robbins-Monro conditions. However, in practice, a
wider variety of step-size schemes are frequently employed, yet existing
convergence results remain limited and often rely on strong assumptions. This
paper bridges this gap by introducing a novel analytical framework based on a
stopping-time method, enabling asymptotic convergence analysis of SGD under
more relaxed step-size conditions and weaker assumptions. In the non-convex
setting, we prove the almost sure convergence of SGD iterates for step-sizes $
\{ \epsilon_t \}_{t \geq 1} $ satisfying $\sum_{t=1}^{+\infty} \epsilon_t =
+\infty$ and $\sum_{t=1}^{+\infty} \epsilon_t^p < +\infty$ for some $p > 2$.
Compared with previous studies, our analysis eliminates the global Lipschitz
continuity assumption on the loss function and relaxes the boundedness
requirements for higher-order moments of stochastic gradients. Building upon
the almost sure convergence results, we further establish $L_2$ convergence.
These significantly relaxed assumptions make our theoretical results more
general, thereby enhancing their applicability in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) are intricate biological systems that control
gene expression and regulation in response to environmental and developmental
cues. Advances in computational biology, coupled with high throughput

Conclusion: 轻量级UQ方法（如DPOSE）可提升GNN材料建模的鲁棒性，为未来与主动学习策略的结合奠定基础。

Abstract: Machine-learned potentials (MLPs) have revolutionized materials discovery by
providing accurate and efficient predictions of molecular and material
properties. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art
approach due to their ability to capture complex atomic interactions. However,
GNNs often produce unreliable predictions when encountering out-of-domain data
and it is difficult to identify when that happens. To address this challenge,
we explore Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) techniques, focusing on Direct
Propagation of Shallow Ensembles (DPOSE) as a computationally efficient
alternative to deep ensembles. By integrating DPOSE into the SchNet model, we
assess its ability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates across diverse
Density Functional Theory datasets, including QM9, OC20, and Gold Molecular
Dynamics. Our findings often demonstrate that DPOSE successfully distinguishes
between in-domain and out-of-domain samples, exhibiting higher uncertainty for
unobserved molecule and material classes. This work highlights the potential of
lightweight UQ methods in improving the robustness of GNN-based materials
modeling and lays the foundation for future integration with active learning
strategies.

Motivation: 对抗攻击可能导致深度学习模型输出错误分类，对自动驾驶车辆感知模块造成严重后果，因此需要研究更鲁棒的模型。

Method: 使用AlexNet和VGG-16作为特征提取器，构建HCQ-DL模型，并在1000多个量子电路中测试其对PGD、FGSA和GA三种对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Result: HCQ-DL模型在无攻击场景下准确率超过95%，在GA和FGSA攻击下超过91%，远高于C-DL模型；在PGD攻击下，AlexNet-based HCQ-DL模型准确率为85%，而C-DL模型低于21%。

Conclusion: HCQ-DL模型在对抗攻击下表现出更高的准确性和鲁棒性，适用于自动驾驶车辆感知模块。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based image classification models are essential for
autonomous vehicle (AV) perception modules since incorrect categorization might
have severe repercussions. Adversarial attacks are widely studied cyberattacks
that can lead DL models to predict inaccurate output, such as incorrectly
classified traffic signs by the perception module of an autonomous vehicle. In
this study, we create and compare hybrid classical-quantum deep learning
(HCQ-DL) models with classical deep learning (C-DL) models to demonstrate
robustness against adversarial attacks for perception modules. Before feeding
them into the quantum system, we used transfer learning models, alexnet and
vgg-16, as feature extractors. We tested over 1000 quantum circuits in our
HCQ-DL models for projected gradient descent (PGD), fast gradient sign attack
(FGSA), and gradient attack (GA), which are three well-known untargeted
adversarial approaches. We evaluated the performance of all models during
adversarial attacks and no-attack scenarios. Our HCQ-DL models maintain
accuracy above 95\% during a no-attack scenario and above 91\% for GA and FGSA
attacks, which is higher than C-DL models. During the PGD attack, our
alexnet-based HCQ-DL model maintained an accuracy of 85\% compared to C-DL
models that achieved accuracies below 21\%. Our results highlight that the
HCQ-DL models provide improved accuracy for traffic sign classification under
adversarial settings compared to their classical counterparts.

<details>

Motivation: 传统特征选择方法在PU学习中将未标记数据视为负样本，可能无法捕捉正样本的统计特性，导致性能不佳。

Method: FSCPU将特征选择问题建模为二元优化任务，目标函数明确结合了PU学习中的聚类假设。

Result: 在合成数据集和三个开放数据集上的实验表明，FSCPU在不同数据条件下表现优异。

Conclusion: FSCPU在PU学习中具有竞争力，即使聚类假设不完全成立时仍表现良好。

Abstract: Feature selection is essential for efficient data mining and sometimes
encounters the positive-unlabeled (PU) learning scenario, where only a few
positive labels are available, while most data remains unlabeled. In certain
real-world PU learning tasks, data subjected to adequate feature selection
often form clusters with concentrated positive labels. Conventional feature
selection methods that treat unlabeled data as negative may fail to capture the
statistical characteristics of positive data in such scenarios, leading to
suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a novel feature selection
method based on the cluster assumption in PU learning, called FSCPU. FSCPU
formulates the feature selection problem as a binary optimization task, with an
objective function explicitly designed to incorporate the cluster assumption in
the PU learning setting. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of FSCPU across various data conditions. Moreover, comparisons
with 10 conventional algorithms on three open datasets show that FSCPU achieves
competitive performance in downstream classification tasks, even when the
cluster assumption does not strictly hold.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型的多模态复杂性可能带来传统安全措施无法应对的潜在威胁，需通过推理跨模态预判风险。

Method: 提出VLMGuard-R1框架，采用三阶段推理管道生成数据集，训练提示重写器动态优化用户输入。

Conclusion: 多模态推理驱动的提示重写是提升视觉语言模型安全性的有效方向。

Abstract: Aligning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with safety standards is essential to
mitigate risks arising from their multimodal complexity, where integrating
vision and language unveils subtle threats beyond the reach of conventional
safeguards. Inspired by the insight that reasoning across modalities is key to
preempting intricate vulnerabilities, we propose a novel direction for VLM
safety: multimodal reasoning-driven prompt rewriting. To this end, we introduce
VLMGuard-R1, a proactive framework that refines user inputs through a
reasoning-guided rewriter, dynamically interpreting text-image interactions to
deliver refined prompts that bolster safety across diverse VLM architectures
without altering their core parameters. To achieve this, we devise a
three-stage reasoning pipeline to synthesize a dataset that trains the rewriter
to infer subtle threats, enabling tailored, actionable responses over generic
refusals. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks with five VLMs reveal
that VLMGuard-R1 outperforms four baselines. In particular, VLMGuard-R1
achieves a remarkable 43.59\% increase in average safety across five models on
the SIUO benchmark.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种驾驶员主观感知风险（DSPR）模型，通过半监督学习策略和CNN-Bi-LSTM-TPA网络预测实时主观风险评分（SRRs），准确率达87.91%，为提升自动驾驶系统安全性和驾驶员信任提供了有效方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驾驶员对风险的感知影响其对自动驾驶系统的接受、信任和使用，但现有方法难以评估这种主观感知风险。

Method: 采用20名参与者的驾驶模拟实验收集SRRs数据，嵌入CNN-Bi-LSTM-TPA网络和半监督学习策略以减少主观随机性带来的数据噪声。

Result: DSPR模型预测SRRs的准确率最高（87.91%），半监督策略提升准确率20.12%，CNN-Bi-LSTM-TPA网络在四种LSTM结构中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估驾驶员感知风险提供了有效方法，有助于提升自动驾驶系统安全性和驾驶员信任。

Abstract: Drivers' perception of risk determines their acceptance, trust, and use of
the Automated Driving Systems (ADSs). However, perceived risk is subjective and
difficult to evaluate using existing methods. To address this issue, a driver's
subjective perceived risk (DSPR) model is proposed, regarding perceived risk as
a dynamically triggered mechanism with anisotropy and attenuation. 20
participants are recruited for a driver-in-the-loop experiment to report their
real-time subjective risk ratings (SRRs) when experiencing various automatic
driving scenarios. A convolutional neural network and bidirectional long
short-term memory network with temporal pattern attention (CNN-Bi-LSTM-TPA) is
embedded into a semi-supervised learning strategy to predict SRRs, aiming to
reduce data noise caused by subjective randomness of participants. The results
illustrate that DSPR achieves the highest prediction accuracy of 87.91% in
predicting SRRs, compared to three state-of-the-art risk models. The
semi-supervised strategy improves accuracy by 20.12%. Besides, CNN-Bi-LSTM-TPA
network presents the highest accuracy among four different LSTM structures.
This study offers an effective method for assessing driver's perceived risk,
providing support for the safety enhancement of ADS and driver's trust
improvement.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的物理信息神经网络（PINN）学习范式——约束学习（Constrained Learning），能够利用非时间序列或部分观测数据近似一阶导数或运动，并开发了优化方法MPOCtrL。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINN框架依赖完全观测的时间序列数据，而许多系统难以获取此类数据，因此需要一种新方法处理非时间序列或部分观测数据。

Method: 开发了约束学习的计算原理和数学框架，并提出了MPOCtrL优化方法，平衡物理模型与观测数据的拟合。

Result: 实验表明，MPOCtrL能有效检测观测数据与系统物理特性间的非线性依赖，尤其在代谢通量分析任务中优于现有数据驱动通量估计器。

Conclusion: 约束学习和MPOCtrL为处理非时间序列或部分观测数据提供了有效工具，扩展了PINN的应用范围。

Abstract: A physics-informed neural network (PINN) models the dynamics of a system by
integrating the governing physical laws into the architecture of a neural
network. By enforcing physical laws as constraints, PINN overcomes challenges
with data scarsity and potentially high dimensionality. Existing PINN
frameworks rely on fully observed time-course data, the acquisition of which
could be prohibitive for many systems. In this study, we developed a new PINN
learning paradigm, namely Constrained Learning, that enables the approximation
of first-order derivatives or motions using non-time course or partially
observed data. Computational principles and a general mathematical formulation
of Constrained Learning were developed. We further introduced MPOCtrL (Message
Passing Optimization-based Constrained Learning) an optimization approach
tailored for the Constrained Learning framework that strives to balance the
fitting of physical models and observed data. Its code is available at github
link: https://github.com/ptdang1001/MPOCtrL Experiments on synthetic and
real-world data demonstrated that MPOCtrL can effectively detect the nonlinear
dependency between observed data and the underlying physical properties of the
system. In particular, on the task of metabolic flux analysis, MPOCtrL
outperforms all existing data-driven flux estimators.

TL;DR: 论文研究了在多任务线性分类问题中，通过梯度下降（GD）进行持续学习，发现当任务联合线性可分时，分类器方向收敛于联合最大间隔解；任务顺序对遗忘和知识转移有显著影响；非联合可分时，模型收敛于联合损失函数的最小值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在多任务持续学习中，梯度下降如何影响分类器的方向收敛性，以及任务顺序对遗忘和知识转移的作用。

Method: 通过固定迭代次数的梯度下降（GD）顺序训练多任务线性分类器，分析任务顺序（循环或随机）对结果的影响。

Result: 联合线性可分任务下，分类器方向收敛于联合最大间隔解；循环顺序中遗忘现象与任务对齐相关，且随循环次数减少；非联合可分时，模型收敛于联合损失函数的最小值。

Conclusion: 梯度下降在多任务持续学习中能有效收敛于联合解，任务顺序对遗忘和知识转移有重要影响，为非联合可分任务提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We study continual learning on multiple linear classification tasks by
sequentially running gradient descent (GD) for a fixed budget of iterations per
task. When all tasks are jointly linearly separable and are presented in a
cyclic/random order, we show the directional convergence of the trained linear
classifier to the joint (offline) max-margin solution. This is surprising
because GD training on a single task is implicitly biased towards the
individual max-margin solution for the task, and the direction of the joint
max-margin solution can be largely different from these individual solutions.
Additionally, when tasks are given in a cyclic order, we present a
non-asymptotic analysis on cycle-averaged forgetting, revealing that (1)
alignment between tasks is indeed closely tied to catastrophic forgetting and
backward knowledge transfer and (2) the amount of forgetting vanishes to zero
as the cycle repeats. Lastly, we analyze the case where the tasks are no longer
jointly separable and show that the model trained in a cyclic order converges
to the unique minimum of the joint loss function.

Abstract: Graph self-supervised learning has gained significant attention recently.
However, many existing approaches heavily depend on perturbations, and
inappropriate perturbations may corrupt the graph's inherent information. The
Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) is a powerful autoencoder
extensively used in fields such as computer vision; however, its application to
graph data remains underexplored. In this paper, we provide an empirical
analysis of vector quantization in the context of graph autoencoders,
demonstrating its significant enhancement of the model's capacity to capture
graph topology. Furthermore, we identify two key challenges associated with
vector quantization when applying in graph data: codebook underutilization and
codebook space sparsity. For the first challenge, we propose an annealing-based
encoding strategy that promotes broad code utilization in the early stages of
training, gradually shifting focus toward the most effective codes as training
progresses. For the second challenge, we introduce a hierarchical two-layer
codebook that captures relationships between embeddings through clustering. The
second layer codebook links similar codes, encouraging the model to learn
closer embeddings for nodes with similar features and structural topology in
the graph. Our proposed model outperforms 16 representative baseline methods in
self-supervised link prediction and node classification tasks across multiple
datasets.

Conclusion: TimeCapsule通过简化框架统一关键技术，为LTSF任务提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent deep learning models for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF)
often emphasize complex, handcrafted designs, while simpler architectures like
linear models or MLPs have often outperformed these intricate solutions. In
this paper, we revisit and organize the core ideas behind several key
techniques, such as redundancy reduction and multi-scale modeling, which are
frequently employed in advanced LTSF models. Our goal is to streamline these
ideas for more efficient deep learning utilization. To this end, we introduce
TimeCapsule, a model built around the principle of high-dimensional information
compression that unifies these techniques in a generalized yet simplified
framework. Specifically, we model time series as a 3D tensor, incorporating
temporal, variate, and level dimensions, and leverage mode production to
capture multi-mode dependencies while achieving dimensionality compression. We
propose an internal forecast within the compressed representation domain,
supported by the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), to monitor the
learning of predictive representations. Extensive experiments on challenging
benchmarks demonstrate the versatility of our method, showing that TimeCapsule
can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多标签特征选择方法主要关注全局特征，忽视了标签个性化需求，限制了性能。

Method: GPMFS首先通过标签相关性识别全局特征，再为每个标签自适应补充个性化特征。

Result: 实验证明GPMFS在性能和可解释性上优于现有方法，并揭示了标签个性化特征选择的重要性。

Conclusion: GPMFS展示了结合全局与个性化特征选择的必要性，为多标签学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence methods are increasingly applied to complex task
scenarios, high dimensional multi-label learning has emerged as a prominent
research focus. At present, the curse of dimensionality remains one of the
major bottlenecks in high-dimensional multi-label learning, which can be
effectively addressed through multi-label feature selection methods. However,
existing multi-label feature selection methods mostly focus on identifying
global features shared across all labels, which overlooks personalized
characteristics and specific requirements of individual labels. This
global-only perspective may limit the ability to capture label-specific
discriminative information, thereby affecting overall performance. In this
paper, we propose a novel method called GPMFS (Global Foundation and
Personalized Optimization for Multi-Label Feature Selection). GPMFS firstly
identifies global features by exploiting label correlations, then adaptively
supplements each label with a personalized subset of discriminative features
using a threshold-controlled strategy. Experiments on multiple real-world
datasets demonstrate that GPMFS achieves superior performance while maintaining
strong interpretability and robustness. Furthermore, GPMFS provides insights
into the label-specific strength across different multi-label datasets, thereby
demonstrating the necessity and potential applicability of personalized feature
selection approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习依赖服务器-客户端架构，而DNCFL问题尚未充分研究，需要解决数据异构性和通信成本问题。

Method: 基于近端随机梯度跟踪，引入动量优化和局部更新，减少随机梯度的方差和通信开销。

Result: 理论分析表明，DEPOSITUM达到ε-稳定点的迭代复杂度为O(1/ε²)，且梯度误差以O(1/T)速率下降。实验验证其优于其他算法。

Conclusion: DEPOSITUM有效解决了DNCFL问题，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) eliminates the reliance on the
server-client architecture inherent in traditional federated learning,
attracting significant research interest in recent years. Simultaneously, the
objective functions in machine learning tasks are often nonconvex and
frequently incorporate additional, potentially nonsmooth regularization terms
to satisfy practical requirements, thereby forming nonconvex composite
optimization problems. Employing DFL methods to solve such general optimization
problems leads to the formulation of Decentralized Nonconvex Composite
Federated Learning (DNCFL), a topic that remains largely underexplored. In this
paper, we propose a novel DNCFL algorithm, termed \bf{DEPOSITUM}. Built upon
proximal stochastic gradient tracking, DEPOSITUM mitigates the impact of data
heterogeneity by enabling clients to approximate the global gradient. The
introduction of momentums in the proximal gradient descent step, replacing
tracking variables, reduces the variance introduced by stochastic gradients.
Additionally, DEPOSITUM supports local updates of client variables,
significantly reducing communication costs. Theoretical analysis demonstrates
that DEPOSITUM achieves an expected $\epsilon$-stationary point with an
iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$. The proximal gradient,
consensus errors, and gradient estimation errors decrease at a sublinear rate
of $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$. With appropriate parameter selection, the algorithm
achieves network-independent linear speedup without requiring mega-batch
sampling. Finally, we apply DEPOSITUM to the training of neural networks on
real-world datasets, systematically examining the influence of various
hyperparameters on its performance. Comparisons with other federated composite
optimization algorithms validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

significant accuracy improvements. GraphOmni's modular and extensible design
establishes a robust foundation for future research, facilitating advancements
toward general-purpose graph reasoning models.

Conclusion: Sign-In为解决稀疏神经网络训练中的符号问题提供了新思路，但完全缩小PaI与密集到稀疏训练的性能差距仍是未来挑战。

Abstract: The performance gap between training sparse neural networks from scratch
(PaI) and dense-to-sparse training presents a major roadblock for efficient
deep learning. According to the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, PaI hinges on
finding a problem specific parameter initialization. As we show, to this end,
determining correct parameter signs is sufficient. Yet, they remain elusive to
PaI. To address this issue, we propose Sign-In, which employs a dynamic
reparameterization that provably induces sign flips. Such sign flips are
complementary to the ones that dense-to-sparse training can accomplish,
rendering Sign-In as an orthogonal method. While our experiments and theory
suggest performance improvements of PaI, they also carve out the main open
challenge to close the gap between PaI and dense-to-sparse training.

Abstract: The loss landscape of Variational Quantum Neural Networks (VQNNs) is
characterized by local minima that grow exponentially with increasing qubits.
Because of this, it is more challenging to recover information from model
gradients during training compared to classical Neural Networks (NNs). In this
paper we present a numerical scheme that successfully reconstructs input
training, real-world, practical data from trainable VQNNs' gradients. Our
scheme is based on gradient inversion that works by combining gradients
estimation with the finite difference method and adaptive low-pass filtering.
The scheme is further optimized with Kalman filter to obtain efficient
convergence. Our experiments show that our algorithm can invert even
batch-trained data, given the VQNN model is sufficiently over-parameterized.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the application of Permutation Decision Trees (PDT)
and strategic trailing for predicting stock market movements and executing
profitable trades in the Indian stock market. We focus on high-frequency data
using 5-minute candlesticks for the top 50 stocks listed in the NIFTY 50 index.
We implement a trading strategy that aims to buy stocks at lower prices and
sell them at higher prices, capitalizing on short-term market fluctuations. Due
to regulatory constraints in India, short selling is not considered in our
strategy. The model incorporates various technical indicators and employs
hyperparameters such as the trailing stop-loss value and support thresholds to
manage risk effectively. Our results indicate that the proposed trading bot has
the potential to outperform the market average and yield returns higher than
the risk-free rate offered by 10-year Indian government bonds. We trained and
tested data on a 60 day dataset provided by Yahoo Finance. Specifically, 12
days for testing and 48 days for training. Our bot based on permutation
decision tree achieved a profit of 1.3468 % over a 12-day testing period, where
as a bot based on LSTM gave a return of 0.1238 % over a 12-day testing period
and a bot based on RNN gave a return of 0.3096 % over a 12-day testing period.
All of the bots outperform the buy-and-hold strategy, which resulted in a loss

Motivation: 在资源受限的异构物联网设备上实现高效且隐私保护的联邦学习具有挑战性。

Result: 实验表明，FedX显著提升了量化效率（8.43倍）、设备计算时间（1.5倍）和端到端训练时间（1.36倍）。

Conclusion: FedX通过结合模型量化和知识共享，实现了高效且资源优化的联邦学习。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows collaborative training among multiple devices
without data sharing, thus enabling privacy-sensitive applications on mobile or
Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as mobile health and asset tracking.
However, designing an FL system with good model utility that works with low
computation/communication overhead on heterogeneous, resource-constrained
mobile/IoT devices is challenging. To address this problem, this paper proposes
FedX, a novel adaptive model decomposition and quantization FL system for IoT.
To balance utility with resource constraints on IoT devices, FedX decomposes a
global FL model into different sub-networks with adaptive numbers of quantized
bits for different devices. The key idea is that a device with fewer resources
receives a smaller sub-network for lower overhead but utilizes a larger number
of quantized bits for higher model utility, and vice versa. The quantization
operations in FedX are done at the server to reduce the computational load on
devices. FedX iteratively minimizes the losses in the devices' local data and
in the server's public data using quantized sub-networks under a regularization
term, and thus it maximizes the benefits of combining FL with model
quantization through knowledge sharing among the server and devices in a
cost-effective training process. Extensive experiments show that FedX
significantly improves quantization times by up to 8.43X, on-device computation
time by 1.5X, and total end-to-end training time by 1.36X, compared with
baseline FL systems. We guarantee the global model convergence theoretically
and validate local model convergence empirically, highlighting FedX's
optimization efficiency.

Abstract: Classifying imbalanced datasets remains a significant challenge in machine
learning, particularly with big data where instances are unevenly distributed
among classes, leading to class imbalance issues that impact classifier
performance. While Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) addresses
this challenge by generating new instances for the under-represented minority
class, it faces obstacles in the form of noise and outliers during the creation
of new samples. In this paper, a proposed approach, iHHO-SMOTe, which addresses
the limitations of SMOTE by first cleansing the data from noise points. This
process involves employing feature selection using a random forest to identify
the most valuable features, followed by applying the Density-Based Spatial
Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to detect outliers
based on the selected features. The identified outliers from the minority
classes are then removed, creating a refined dataset for subsequent
oversampling using the hybrid approach called iHHO-SMOTe. The comprehensive
experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate the exceptional performance of
the proposed model, with an AUC score exceeding 0.99, a high G-means score of
0.99 highlighting its robustness, and an outstanding F1-score consistently
exceeding 0.967. These findings collectively establish Cleansed iHHO-SMOTe as a
formidable contender in addressing imbalanced datasets, focusing on noise
reduction and outlier handling for improved classification models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文揭示了联邦学习（FL）在非独立同分布（non-IID）数据下的新漏洞，并提出了一种名为CollaPois的新型协作后门攻击方法，能够高效且隐蔽地破坏FL模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示FL在非IID数据下的潜在安全风险，特别是针对模型投毒攻击的脆弱性。

Method: 开发了CollaPois攻击方法，通过分发预训练的带后门的模型给多个受控客户端，协作生成恶意梯度，使FL模型收敛到后门模型。

Result: 实验证明CollaPois在多种数据集上优于现有攻击方法，能绕过防御机制，且仅需少量受控客户端即可生效。

Conclusion: CollaPois攻击揭示了FL在非IID数据下的严重安全漏洞，需开发更强大的防御机制。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training using
decentralized private data from multiple clients. While FL has shown robustness
against poisoning attacks with basic defenses, our research reveals new
vulnerabilities stemming from non-independent and identically distributed
(non-IID) data among clients. These vulnerabilities pose a substantial risk of
model poisoning in real-world FL scenarios.
  To demonstrate such vulnerabilities, we develop a novel collaborative
backdoor poisoning attack called CollaPois. In this attack, we distribute a
single pre-trained model infected with a Trojan to a group of compromised
clients. These clients then work together to produce malicious gradients,
causing the FL model to consistently converge towards a low-loss region
centered around the Trojan-infected model. Consequently, the impact of the
Trojan is amplified, especially when the benign clients have diverse local data
distributions and scattered local gradients. CollaPois stands out by achieving
its goals while involving only a limited number of compromised clients, setting
it apart from existing attacks. Also, CollaPois effectively avoids noticeable
shifts or degradation in the FL model's performance on legitimate data samples,
allowing it to operate stealthily and evade detection by advanced robust FL
algorithms.
  Thorough theoretical analysis and experiments conducted on various benchmark
datasets demonstrate the superiority of CollaPois compared to state-of-the-art
backdoor attacks. Notably, CollaPois bypasses existing backdoor defenses,
especially in scenarios where clients possess diverse data distributions.
Moreover, the results show that CollaPois remains effective even when involving
a small number of compromised clients. Notably, clients whose local data is
closely aligned with compromised clients experience higher risks of backdoor
infections.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用音频模型（如MAE）在生物声学监测等专业领域表现不佳，而鸟类声音分类对环境健康评估至关重要。

Method: 提出Bird-MAE，基于BirdSet数据集进行预训练，并探索了预训练、微调及冻结表示的使用方法。

Result: Bird-MAE在所有下游任务中达到最优性能，多标签分类表现显著优于通用模型。

Conclusion: Bird-MAE通过专用设计和参数高效方法，显著提升了鸟类声音分类的性能。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) pretrained on AudioSet fail to capture the
fine-grained acoustic characteristics of specialized domains such as
bioacoustic monitoring. Bird sound classification is critical for assessing
environmental health, yet general-purpose models inadequately address its
unique acoustic challenges. To address this, we introduce Bird-MAE, a
domain-specialized MAE pretrained on the large-scale BirdSet dataset. We
explore adjustments to pretraining, fine-tuning and utilizing frozen
representations. Bird-MAE achieves state-of-the-art results across all BirdSet
downstream tasks, substantially improving multi-label classification
performance compared to the general-purpose Audio-MAE baseline. Additionally,
we propose prototypical probing, a parameter-efficient method for leveraging
MAEs' frozen representations. Bird-MAE's prototypical probes outperform linear
probing by up to 37\% in MAP and narrow the gap to fine-tuning to approximately
3\% on average on BirdSet.

Result: 通过实验验证动态权重衰减策略（如训练中关闭权重衰减）可以改善泛化性能。

Conclusion: 显式正则化与隐式偏差的相互作用对模型泛化至关重要，动态权重衰减策略是一种有效的优化手段。

Abstract: Implicit bias plays an important role in explaining how overparameterized
models generalize well. Explicit regularization like weight decay is often
employed in addition to prevent overfitting. While both concepts have been
studied separately, in practice, they often act in tandem. Understanding their
interplay is key to controlling the shape and strength of implicit bias, as it
can be modified by explicit regularization. To this end, we incorporate
explicit regularization into the mirror flow framework and analyze its lasting
effects on the geometry of the training dynamics, covering three distinct
effects: positional bias, type of bias, and range shrinking. Our analytical
approach encompasses a broad class of problems, including sparse coding, matrix
sensing, single-layer attention, and LoRA, for which we demonstrate the utility
of our insights. To exploit the lasting effect of regularization and highlight
the potential benefit of dynamic weight decay schedules, we propose to switch
off weight decay during training, which can improve generalization, as we
demonstrate in experiments.

Result: 揭示了ICL的分阶段学习、固定点和守恒定律，并提出了理论工具解释非线性模型中的ICL现象。

Conclusion: 论文为ICL提供了精确的动态模型，并为分析复杂Transformer训练提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Transformer models exhibit remarkable in-context learning (ICL), adapting to
novel tasks from examples within their context, yet the underlying mechanisms
remain largely mysterious. Here, we provide an exact analytical
characterization of ICL emergence by deriving the closed-form stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) dynamics for a simplified linear transformer performing
regression tasks. Our analysis reveals key properties: (1) a natural separation
of timescales directly governed by the input data's covariance structure,
leading to staged learning; (2) an exact description of how ICL develops,
including fixed points corresponding to learned algorithms and conservation
laws constraining the dynamics; and (3) surprisingly nonlinear learning
behavior despite the model's linearity. We hypothesize this phenomenology
extends to non-linear models. To test this, we introduce theory-inspired
macroscopic measures (spectral rank dynamics, subspace stability) and use them
to provide mechanistic explanations for (1) the sudden emergence of ICL in
attention-only networks and (2) delayed generalization (grokking) in modular
arithmetic models. Our work offers an exact dynamical model for ICL and
theoretically grounded tools for analyzing complex transformer training.

Abstract: This study explores the potential of using wrist-worn inertial sensors to
automate the labeling of ARAT (Action Research Arm Test) items. While the ARAT
is commonly used to assess upper limb motor function, its limitations include
subjectivity and time consumption of clinical staff. By using IMU (Inertial
Measurement Unit) sensors and MiniROCKET as a time series classification
technique, this investigation aims to classify ARAT items based on sensor
recordings. We test common preprocessing strategies to efficiently leverage
included information in the data. Afterward, we use the best preprocessing to
improve the classification. The dataset includes recordings of 45 participants
performing various ARAT items. Results show that MiniROCKET offers a fast and
reliable approach for classifying ARAT domains, although challenges remain in
distinguishing between individual resembling items. Future work may involve
improving classification through more advanced machine-learning models and data
enhancements.

TL;DR: RL-PINNs是一种基于强化学习的自适应采样框架，用于高效训练物理信息神经网络（PINNs），避免了传统方法的多轮采样和重复训练问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自适应采样方法（如基于残差的细化）需要多轮采样和重复训练，导致计算效率低下，尤其是在高维或高阶导数场景中。

Method: RL-PINNs将自适应采样建模为马尔可夫决策过程，通过强化学习代理动态选择最优训练点，并使用计算高效的函数变分作为奖励信号。

Result: 实验表明，RL-PINNs在多种PDE基准测试中显著优于现有方法，且采样开销极低，适用于高维和高阶问题。

Conclusion: RL-PINNs通过强化学习实现了高效的单轮采样训练，为高维和高阶PDE问题提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework
for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, their performance
heavily relies on the strategy used to select training points. Conventional
adaptive sampling methods, such as residual-based refinement, often require
multi-round sampling and repeated retraining of PINNs, leading to computational
inefficiency due to redundant points and costly gradient
computations-particularly in high-dimensional or high-order derivative
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose RL-PINNs, a reinforcement
learning(RL)-driven adaptive sampling framework that enables efficient training
with only a single round of sampling. Our approach formulates adaptive sampling
as a Markov decision process, where an RL agent dynamically selects optimal
training points by maximizing a long-term utility metric. Critically, we
replace gradient-dependent residual metrics with a computationally efficient
function variation as the reward signal, eliminating the overhead of derivative
calculations. Furthermore, we employ a delayed reward mechanism to prioritize
long-term training stability over short-term gains. Extensive experiments
across diverse PDE benchmarks, including low-regular, nonlinear,
high-dimensional, and high-order problems, demonstrate that RL-PINNs
significantly outperforms existing residual-driven adaptive methods in
accuracy. Notably, RL-PINNs achieve this with negligible sampling overhead,
making them scalable to high-dimensional and high-order problems.

have high predictive power for the performance of architectures both within and
across datasets, ii) these surrogates can be used to filter out bad
architectures when searching on novel datasets, thereby significantly speeding
up search and achieving better final performances, and iii) the surrogates can
be further used directly as the search objective for huge speed-ups.

Conclusion: 该VM为低精度计算提供了高效且灵活的解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for AI-powered applications
but demands substantial computational resources, particularly in memory
bandwidth and computational throughput. Low-precision computation has emerged
as a key technique to improve efficiency while reducing resource consumption.
Existing approaches for generating low-precision kernels are limited to weight
bit widths that are powers of two and suffer from suboptimal performance due to
high-level GPU programming abstractions. These abstractions restrict critical
optimizations, such as fine-grained register management and optimized memory
access patterns, which are essential for efficient low-precision computations.
In this paper, we introduce a virtual machine (VM) designed for General-Purpose
GPU (GPGPU) computing, enabling support for low-precision data types with
arbitrary bit widths while maintaining GPU programmability. The proposed VM
features a thread-block-level programming model, a hierarchical memory space, a
novel algebraic layout system, and extensive support for diverse low-precision
data types. VM programs are compiled into highly efficient GPU programs with
automatic vectorization and instruction selection. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our VM efficiently supports a full spectrum of low-precision
data types, and outperforms state-of-the-art low-precision kernels on their
supported types. Compared to existing compilers like Triton and Ladder, as well
as hand-optimized kernels such as QuantLLM and Marlin, our VM achieves
performance improvements of 1.75x, 2.61x, 1.29x and 1.03x, respectively.

Motivation: 现有单代理延迟决策方法在高风险场景中不足，需要集体专家知识。

Method: 提出Top-$k$ L2D和Top-$k(x)$ L2D框架，分别固定和自适应选择代理数量，并设计新的替代损失函数。

Result: 实验证明框架在分类和回归任务中有效，且理论证明了其贝叶斯一致性。

Conclusion: Top-$k$和Top-$k(x)$ L2D框架显著提升了决策系统的可靠性和灵活性。

Abstract: Learning-to-Defer (L2D) enables decision-making systems to improve
reliability by selectively deferring uncertain predictions to more competent
agents. However, most existing approaches focus exclusively on single-agent
deferral, which is often inadequate in high-stakes scenarios that require
collective expertise. We propose Top-$k$ Learning-to-Defer, a generalization of
the classical two-stage L2D framework that allocates each query to the $k$ most
confident agents instead of a single one. To further enhance flexibility and
cost-efficiency, we introduce Top-$k(x)$ Learning-to-Defer, an adaptive
extension that learns the optimal number of agents to consult for each query,
based on input complexity, agent competency distributions, and consultation
costs. For both settings, we derive a novel surrogate loss and prove that it is
Bayes-consistent and $(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{G})$-consistent, ensuring
convergence to the Bayes-optimal allocation. Notably, we show that the
well-established model cascades paradigm arises as a restricted instance of our
Top-$k$ and Top-$k(x)$ formulations. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on both
classification and regression tasks.

Result: CoT在潜在变量与训练数据相似时表现良好，但随着相似性降低性能下降。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了CoT在OOD条件下的局限性，为未来开发更具鲁棒性的推理策略提供了方向。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a powerful technique to
improve in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs) by breaking
complex reasoning into intermediate steps. However, the ability of CoT to
generalize under distribution shift remains poorly understood. In this work, we
extend a latent-variable framework for CoT prompting and study its behavior on
two prototypical out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios: (i) the latent variables
for CoT steps are permuted into novel combinations, and (ii) the latent
variables uniformly scaled by a factor. Our experiments demonstrate that CoT
inference generalizes effectively to OOD samples whose latent variables closely
resemble those seen during training, but its performance degrades as this
similarity decreases. These findings provide foundational insights into the
strengths and limitations of CoT prompting under OOD conditions and suggest
directions for developing more resilient reasoning strategies in future LLMs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated promising performance in graph
analysis. Nevertheless, the inference process of GNNs remains costly, hindering
their applications for large graphs. This paper proposes inference-friendly
graph compression (IFGC), a graph compression scheme to accelerate GNNs
inference. Given a graph $G$ and a GNN $M$, an IFGC computes a small compressed
graph $G_c$, to best preserve the inference results of $M$ over $G$, such that
the result can be directly inferred by accessing $G_c$ with no or little
decompression cost. (1) We characterize IFGC with a class of inference
equivalence relation. The relation captures the node pairs in $G$ that are not
distinguishable for GNN inference. (2) We introduce three practical
specifications of IFGC for representative GNNs: structural preserving
compression (SPGC), which computes $G_c$ that can be directly processed by GNN
inference without decompression; ($\alpha$, $r$)-compression, that allows for a
configurable trade-off between compression ratio and inference quality, and
anchored compression that preserves inference results for specific nodes of
interest. For each scheme, we introduce compression and inference algorithms
with guarantees of efficiency and quality of the inferred results. We conduct
extensive experiments on diverse sets of large-scale graphs, which verifies the
effectiveness and efficiency of our graph compression approaches.

Abstract: Proteins typically exist in complexes, interacting with other proteins or
biomolecules to perform their specific biological roles. Research on
single-chain protein modeling has been extensively and deeply explored, with
advancements seen in models like the series of ESM and AlphaFold. Despite these
developments, the study and modeling of multi-chain proteins remain largely
uncharted, though they are vital for understanding biological functions.
Recognizing the importance of these interactions, we introduce APM (All-Atom
Protein Generative Model), a model specifically designed for modeling
multi-chain proteins. By integrating atom-level information and leveraging data
on multi-chain proteins, APM is capable of precisely modeling inter-chain
interactions and designing protein complexes with binding capabilities from
scratch. It also performs folding and inverse-folding tasks for multi-chain
proteins. Moreover, APM demonstrates versatility in downstream applications: it
achieves enhanced performance through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) while also
supporting zero-shot sampling in certain tasks, achieving state-of-the-art
results. Code will be released at https://github.com/bytedance/apm.

Result: SITh能够更深入地理解SSL中的隐含数据假设，推动学习更具解释性和泛化性的表示。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注SSL的训练动态、有限样本的影响以及归纳偏置的作用，以进一步推动SSL的理论与实践发展。

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) powers many current AI systems. As research
interest and investment grow, the SSL design space continues to expand. The
Platonic view of SSL, following the Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH),
suggests that despite different methods and engineering approaches, all
representations converge to the same Platonic ideal. However, this phenomenon
lacks precise theoretical explanation. By synthesizing evidence from
Identifiability Theory (IT), we show that the PRH can emerge in SSL. However,
current IT cannot explain SSL's empirical success. To bridge the gap between
theory and practice, we propose expanding IT into what we term Singular
Identifiability Theory (SITh), a broader theoretical framework encompassing the
entire SSL pipeline. SITh would allow deeper insights into the implicit data
assumptions in SSL and advance the field towards learning more interpretable
and generalizable representations. We highlight three critical directions for
future research: 1) training dynamics and convergence properties of SSL; 2) the
impact of finite samples, batch size, and data diversity; and 3) the role of
inductive biases in architecture, augmentations, initialization schemes, and
optimizers.

Conclusion: SHIFT在复杂场景（如交叉路口）中表现突出，为轨迹预测提供了更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning-based trajectory prediction models have demonstrated promising
capabilities in capturing complex interactions. However, their
out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge,
particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to
ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral
Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that
uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors
derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory
prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic
spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and
aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels,
which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as
stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation
framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the
nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios,
demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In

*Grigorios G Chrysos,Yongtao Wu,Razvan Pascanu,Philip Torr,Volkan Cevher*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统分析了Hadamard积在深度学习中的核心作用，提出了其四大应用领域，并强调了其在计算效率和表示能力之间的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Hadamard积在深度学习中广泛应用，但其作为核心架构原语的作用尚未被系统研究。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过综合分类Hadamard积的应用，识别了其在深度学习中的四大主要领域，并分析了其非线性交互建模能力。

Result: 研究表明Hadamard积在多模态融合、动态表示调制等任务中表现优异，尤其适合资源受限的场景。

Conclusion: Hadamard积是一种多功能原语，为深度学习架构提供了计算效率与表示能力之间的理想平衡。

Abstract: While convolution and self-attention mechanisms have dominated architectural
design in deep learning, this survey examines a fundamental yet understudied
primitive: the Hadamard product. Despite its widespread implementation across
various applications, the Hadamard product has not been systematically analyzed
as a core architectural primitive. We present the first comprehensive taxonomy
of its applications in deep learning, identifying four principal domains:
higher-order correlation, multimodal data fusion, dynamic representation
modulation, and efficient pairwise operations. The Hadamard product's ability
to model nonlinear interactions with linear computational complexity makes it
particularly valuable for resource-constrained deployments and edge computing
scenarios. We demonstrate its natural applicability in multimodal fusion tasks,
such as visual question answering, and its effectiveness in representation
masking for applications including image inpainting and pruning. This
systematic review not only consolidates existing knowledge about the Hadamard
product's role in deep learning architectures but also establishes a foundation
for future architectural innovations. Our analysis reveals the Hadamard product
as a versatile primitive that offers compelling trade-offs between
computational efficiency and representational power, positioning it as a
crucial component in the deep learning toolkit.

Abstract: Detecting mission-critical anomalous events and data is a crucial challenge
across various industries, including finance, healthcare, and energy. Quantum
computing has recently emerged as a powerful tool for tackling several machine
learning tasks, but training quantum machine learning models remains
challenging, particularly due to the difficulty of gradient calculation. The
challenge is even greater for anomaly detection, where unsupervised learning
methods are essential to ensure practical applicability. To address these
issues, we propose Quorum, the first quantum anomaly detection framework
designed for unsupervised learning that operates without requiring any
training.

Motivation: 随着爱尔兰接近BVD自由状态，开发预测模型以进行针对性监测，降低疾病再次出现的风险变得至关重要。

Method: 研究使用二分类和异常检测技术，评估了多种机器学习算法在高度不平衡的牛群数据上的表现，并通过模拟研究比较了不同样本量和类别不平衡比例下的模型性能。

Result: 随机森林和XGBoost模型表现最优，其中随机森林在2023年牛群状态的预测中正确识别了219/250阳性牛群，同时将需要检测的牛群数量减半。

Conclusion: 随机森林模型在预测BVD阳性牛群中表现最佳，为针对性监测提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) has been the focus of a successful eradication
programme in Ireland, with the herd-level prevalence declining from 11.3% in
2013 to just 0.2% in 2023. As the country moves toward BVD freedom, the
development of predictive models for targeted surveillance becomes increasingly
important to mitigate the risk of disease re-emergence. In this study, we
evaluate the performance of a range of machine learning algorithms, including
binary classification and anomaly detection techniques, for predicting
BVD-positive herds using highly imbalanced herd-level data. We conduct an
extensive simulation study to assess model performance across varying sample
sizes and class imbalance ratios, incorporating resampling, class weighting,
and appropriate evaluation metrics (sensitivity, positive predictive value,
F1-score and AUC values). Random forests and XGBoost models consistently
outperformed other methods, with the random forest model achieving the highest
sensitivity and AUC across scenarios, including real-world prediction of 2023
herd status, correctly identifying 219 of 250 positive herds while halving the
number of herds that require compared to a blanket-testing strategy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的迁移学习框架TAL，利用辅助标签（物候数据）预测目标作物（无冷害数据）的抗寒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决农民缺乏特定作物抗寒数据的问题，利用已有的物候数据提高抗寒性预测准确性。

Method: 通过迁移学习框架TAL，结合源任务（有抗寒和物候数据）和目标任务（仅有物候数据），采用模型选择和平均方法。

Result: 在多个葡萄品种的真实数据中，TAL显著提高了无抗寒数据时的预测准确性。

Conclusion: TAL为无抗寒数据的作物提供了有效的预测方法，填补了迁移学习领域的空白。

Abstract: Cold temperatures can cause significant frost damage to fruit crops depending
on their resilience, or cold hardiness, which changes throughout the dormancy
season. This has led to the development of predictive cold-hardiness models,
which help farmers decide when to deploy expensive frost-mitigation measures.
Unfortunately, cold-hardiness data for model training is only available for
some fruit cultivars due to the need for specialized equipment and expertise.
Rather, farmers often do have years of phenological data (e.g. date of
budbreak) that they regularly collect for their crops. In this work, we
introduce a new transfer-learning framework, Transfer via Auxiliary Labels
(TAL), that allows farmers to leverage the phenological data to produce more
accurate cold-hardiness predictions, even when no cold-hardiness data is
available for their specific crop. The framework assumes a set of source tasks
(cultivars) where each has associated primary labels (cold hardiness) and
auxiliary labels (phenology). However, the target task (new cultivar) is
assumed to only have the auxiliary labels. The goal of TAL is to predict
primary labels for the target task via transfer from the source tasks.
Surprisingly, despite the vast literature on transfer learning, to our
knowledge, the TAL formulation has not been previously addressed. Thus, we
propose several new TAL approaches based on model selection and averaging that
can leverage recent deep multi-task models for cold-hardiness prediction. Our
results on real-world cold-hardiness and phenological data for multiple grape
cultivars demonstrate that TAL can leverage the phenological data to improve
cold-hardiness predictions in the absence of cold-hardiness data.

TL;DR: MIB是一个评估机制解释性方法的基准，包含两个赛道和四个任务，用于比较不同方法在定位因果路径或变量上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了建立持久且有意义的评估标准，衡量新机制解释性方法是否真正改进。

Method: 提出MIB基准，包含电路定位和因果变量定位两个赛道，分别比较不同方法在定位模型组件和特征上的表现。

Result: 在电路定位中，归因和掩码优化方法表现最佳；在因果变量定位中，监督DAS方法最优，而SAE特征不优于标准神经元。

Conclusion: MIB能有效比较方法，并证明该领域取得了实际进展。

Abstract: How can we know whether new mechanistic interpretability methods achieve real
improvements? In pursuit of meaningful and lasting evaluation standards, we
propose MIB, a benchmark with two tracks spanning four tasks and five models.
MIB favors methods that precisely and concisely recover relevant causal
pathways or specific causal variables in neural language models. The circuit
localization track compares methods that locate the model components - and
connections between them - most important for performing a task (e.g.,
attribution patching or information flow routes). The causal variable
localization track compares methods that featurize a hidden vector, e.g.,
sparse autoencoders (SAEs) or distributed alignment search (DAS), and locate
model features for a causal variable relevant to the task. Using MIB, we find
that attribution and mask optimization methods perform best on circuit
localization. For causal variable localization, we find that the supervised DAS
method performs best, while SAE features are not better than neurons, i.e.,
standard dimensions of hidden vectors. These findings illustrate that MIB
enables meaningful comparisons of methods, and increases our confidence that
there has been real progress in the field.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于注意力偏见的框架Miras，用于设计深度学习架构，并展示了三种新型序列模型，在某些任务中表现优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类注意力偏见现象的启发，重新定义神经架构为关联记忆模块，探索超越现有注意力目标的新配置。

Method: 提出Miras框架，包含四种设计选择：关联记忆架构、注意力偏见目标、保留门和记忆学习算法。开发了三种新模型Moneta、Yaad和Memora。

Result: 实验表明，Miras的不同设计选择在不同任务中表现优异，某些情况下超越Transformer和现代线性循环模型。

Conclusion: Miras为深度学习架构设计提供了灵活框架，展示了注意力偏见和保留门机制的有效性。

Abstract: Designing efficient and effective architectural backbones has been in the
core of research efforts to enhance the capability of foundation models.
Inspired by the human cognitive phenomenon of attentional bias-the natural
tendency to prioritize certain events or stimuli-we reconceptualize neural
architectures, including Transformers, Titans, and modern linear recurrent
neural networks as associative memory modules that learn a mapping of keys and
values using an internal objective, referred to as attentional bias.
Surprisingly, we observed that most existing sequence models leverage either
(1) dot-product similarity, or (2) L2 regression objectives as their
attentional bias. Going beyond these objectives, we present a set of
alternative attentional bias configurations along with their effective
approximations to stabilize their training procedure. We then reinterpret
forgetting mechanisms in modern deep learning architectures as a form of
retention regularization, providing a novel set of forget gates for sequence
models. Building upon these insights, we present Miras, a general framework to
design deep learning architectures based on four choices of: (i) associative
memory architecture, (ii) attentional bias objective, (iii) retention gate, and
(iv) memory learning algorithm. We present three novel sequence models-Moneta,
Yaad, and Memora-that go beyond the power of existing linear RNNs while
maintaining a fast parallelizable training process. Our experiments show
different design choices in Miras yield models with varying strengths. For
example, certain instances of Miras achieve exceptional performance in special
tasks such as language modeling, commonsense reasoning, and recall intensive
tasks, even outperforming Transformers and other modern linear recurrent
models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CAD设计生成方法难以有效捕捉设计意图，导致几何更新不可预测，因此需要解决设计对齐问题。

Method: 利用对齐技术训练现有约束生成模型，通过约束求解器的反馈优化模型输出。

Result: 使用对齐技术后，完全约束草图的生成率从8.9%提升至93%，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法可应用于现有约束生成模型，为语言与设计领域的对齐策略研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: We adapt alignment techniques from reasoning LLMs to the task of generating
engineering sketch constraints found in computer-aided design (CAD) models.
Engineering sketches consist of geometric primitives (e.g. points, lines)
connected by constraints (e.g. perpendicular, tangent) that define the
relationships between them. For a design to be easily editable, the constraints
must effectively capture design intent, ensuring the geometry updates
predictably when parameters change. Although current approaches can generate
CAD designs, an open challenge remains to align model outputs with design
intent, we label this problem `design alignment'. A critical first step towards
aligning generative CAD models is to generate constraints which fully-constrain
all geometric primitives, without over-constraining or distorting sketch
geometry. Using alignment techniques to train an existing constraint generation
model with feedback from a constraint solver, we are able to fully-constrain
93% of sketches compared to 34% when using a na\"ive supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) baseline and only 8.9% without alignment. Our approach can be applied to
any existing constraint generation model and sets the stage for further
research bridging alignment strategies between the language and design domains.

Result: 提供了细胞衰老图谱（CAM），揭示了基因嵌入空间的分歧、非线性转变和熵变化等衰老模式。

Conclusion: 衰老是一种耗散过程，提出的计算框架能以分子分辨率测量衰老相关变化。

Abstract: We propose a new theory for aging based on dynamical systems and provide a
data-driven computational method to quantify the changes at the cellular level.
We use ergodic theory to decompose the dynamics of changes during aging and
show that aging is fundamentally a dissipative process within biological
systems, akin to dynamical systems where dissipation occurs due to
non-conservative forces. To quantify the dissipation dynamics, we employ a
transformer-based machine learning algorithm to analyze gene expression data,
incorporating age as a token to assess how age-related dissipation is reflected
in the embedding space. By evaluating the dynamics of gene and age embeddings,
we provide a cellular aging map (CAM) and identify patterns indicative of
divergence in gene embedding space, nonlinear transitions, and entropy
variations during aging for various tissues and cell types. Our results provide
a novel perspective on aging as a dissipative process and introduce a
computational framework that enables measuring age-related changes with
molecular resolution.

Conclusion: 储层计算中的吸引子合并危机和间歇性现象是RNNs的普遍特性，为理解其动力学行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: Reservoir computing can embed attractors into random neural networks (RNNs),
generating a ``mirror'' of a target attractor because of its inherent
symmetrical constraints. In these RNNs, we report that an attractor-merging
crisis accompanied by intermittency emerges simply by adjusting the global
parameter. We further reveal its underlying mechanism through a detailed
analysis of the phase-space structure and demonstrate that this bifurcation
scenario is intrinsic to a general class of RNNs, independent of training data.

Abstract: From 2000 to 2015, the UN's Millennium Development Goals guided global
priorities. The subsequent Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted a more
dynamic approach, with annual indicator updates. As 2030 nears and progress
lags, innovative acceleration strategies are critical. This study develops an
AI-powered knowledge graph system to analyze SDG interconnections, discover
potential new goals, and visualize them online. Using official SDG texts,
Elsevier's keyword dataset, and 1,127 TED Talk transcripts (2020-2023), a pilot
on 269 talks from 2023 applies AI-speculative design, large language models,
and retrieval-augmented generation. Key findings include: (1) Heatmap analysis
reveals strong associations between Goal 10 and Goal 16, and minimal coverage
of Goal 6. (2) In the knowledge graph, simulated dialogue over time reveals new
central nodes, showing how richer data supports divergent thinking and goal
clarity. (3) Six potential new goals are proposed, centered on equity,
resilience, and technology-driven inclusion. This speculative-AI framework
offers fresh insights for policymakers and lays groundwork for future

Method: 通过德国（n=1800）和美国（n=1756）的两次调查，分析公众对AI对齐功能的偏好。

Result: 美国受访者对AI使用更开放，支持所有对齐特征；德国更注重准确性和安全性。个体经验和态度影响偏好。

Conclusion: 研究强调将公众态度纳入AI治理讨论的重要性，并需在理论和政策中明确规范期望。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative Artificial Intelligence have raised public
awareness, shaping expectations and concerns about their societal implications.
Central to these debates is the question of AI alignment -- how well AI systems
meet public expectations regarding safety, fairness, and social values.
However, little is known about what people expect from AI-enabled systems and
how these expectations differ across national contexts. We present evidence
from two surveys of public preferences for key functional features of
AI-enabled systems in Germany (n = 1800) and the United States (n = 1756). We
examine support for four types of alignment in AI moderation: accuracy and
reliability, safety, bias mitigation, and the promotion of aspirational
imaginaries. U.S. respondents report significantly higher AI use and
consistently greater support for all alignment features, reflecting broader
technological openness and higher societal involvement with AI. In both
countries, accuracy and safety enjoy the strongest support, while more
normatively charged goals -- like fairness and aspirational imaginaries --
receive more cautious backing, particularly in Germany. We also explore how
individual experience with AI, attitudes toward free speech, political
ideology, partisan affiliation, and gender shape these preferences. AI use and
free speech support explain more variation in Germany. In contrast, U.S.
responses show greater attitudinal uniformity, suggesting that higher exposure
to AI may consolidate public expectations. These findings contribute to debates
on AI governance and cross-national variation in public preferences. More
broadly, our study demonstrates the value of empirically grounding AI alignment
debates in public attitudes and of explicitly developing normatively grounded
expectations into theoretical and policy discussions on the governance of
AI-generated content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模枪击事件产生大量非结构化文本数据，现有研究难以自动化提取关键信息以支持法律和调查工作。

Method: 应用命名实体识别（NER）技术，结合大语言模型（LLM）进行少样本提示，从新闻、警方报告和社交媒体中提取关键实体。

Result: 实验表明，GPT-4o在NER任务中表现最佳，o1-mini是资源高效的替代方案，且增加样本量能显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为大规模枪击事件的信息提取提供了高效工具，GPT-4o和o1-mini在少样本学习中表现突出。

Abstract: Mass-shooting events pose a significant challenge to public safety,
generating large volumes of unstructured textual data that hinder effective
investigations and the formulation of public policy. Despite the urgency, few
prior studies have effectively automated the extraction of key information from
these events to support legal and investigative efforts. This paper presented
the first dataset designed for knowledge acquisition on mass-shooting events
through the application of named entity recognition (NER) techniques. It
focuses on identifying key entities such as offenders, victims, locations, and
criminal instruments, that are vital for legal and investigative purposes. The
NER process is powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) using few-shot
prompting, facilitating the efficient extraction and organization of critical
information from diverse sources, including news articles, police reports, and
social media. Experimental results on real-world mass-shooting corpora
demonstrate that GPT-4o is the most effective model for mass-shooting NER,
achieving the highest Micro Precision, Micro Recall, and Micro F1-scores.
Meanwhile, o1-mini delivers competitive performance, making it a
resource-efficient alternative for less complex NER tasks. It is also observed
that increasing the shot count enhances the performance of all models, but the
gains are more substantial for GPT-4o and o1-mini, highlighting their superior
adaptability to few-shot learning scenarios.

Conclusion: LLMs的兴起影响了学生写作行为，但未显著改变讨论的核心主题。

Abstract: The release of ChatGPT in late 2022 caused a flurry of activity and concern
in the academic and educational communities. Some see the tool's ability to
generate human-like text that passes at least cursory inspections for factual
accuracy ``often enough'' a golden age of information retrieval and
computer-assisted learning. Some, on the other hand, worry the tool may lead to
unprecedented levels of academic dishonesty and cheating. In this work, we
quantify some of the effects of the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs)
on online education by analyzing a multi-year dataset of student essay
responses from a free university-level MOOC on AI ethics. Our dataset includes
essays submitted both before and after ChatGPT's release. We find that the
launch of ChatGPT coincided with significant changes in both the length and
style of student essays, mirroring observations in other contexts such as
academic publishing. We also observe -- as expected based on related public
discourse -- changes in prevalence of key content words related to AI and LLMs,
but not necessarily the general themes or topics discussed in the student
essays as identified through (dynamic) topic modeling.

Motivation: 消除贫困是联合国可持续发展目标的首要任务，但社会对贫困人群的偏见（aporophobia）阻碍了扶贫政策的制定和实施。

Method: 与非营利组织和政府合作，收集并标注英语推文，构建aporophobia分类体系，并训练分类器进行自动检测。

Result: 提出了社交媒体上aporophobia的分类法，并分析了自动检测的主要挑战。

Conclusion: 该研究为大规模识别和缓解社交媒体上的aporophobia奠定了基础。

Abstract: Eradicating poverty is the first goal in the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals. However, aporophobia -- the societal bias against people
living in poverty -- constitutes a major obstacle to designing, approving and
implementing poverty-mitigation policies. This work presents an initial step
towards operationalizing the concept of aporophobia to identify and track
harmful beliefs and discriminative actions against poor people on social media.
In close collaboration with non-profits and governmental organizations, we
conduct data collection and exploration. Then we manually annotate a corpus of
English tweets from five world regions for the presence of (1) direct
expressions of aporophobia, and (2) statements referring to or criticizing
aporophobic views or actions of others, to comprehensively characterize the
social media discourse related to bias and discrimination against the poor.
Based on the annotated data, we devise a taxonomy of categories of aporophobic
attitudes and actions expressed through speech on social media. Finally, we
train several classifiers and identify the main challenges for automatic
detection of aporophobia in social networks. This work paves the way towards
identifying, tracking, and mitigating aporophobic views on social media at
scale.

Abstract: Accurate prediction and stabilization of blast furnace temperatures are
crucial for optimizing the efficiency and productivity of steel production.
Traditional methods often struggle with the complex and non-linear nature of
the temperature fluctuations within blast furnaces. This paper proposes a novel
approach that combines hybrid quantum machine learning with pulverized coal
injection control to address these challenges. By integrating classical machine
learning techniques with quantum computing algorithms, we aim to enhance
predictive accuracy and achieve more stable temperature control. For this we
utilized a unique prediction-based optimization method. Our method leverages
quantum-enhanced feature space exploration and the robustness of classical
regression models to forecast temperature variations and optimize pulverized
coal injection values. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement in
prediction accuracy over 25 percent and our solution improved temperature
stability to +-7.6 degrees of target range from the earlier variance of +-50
degrees, highlighting the potential of hybrid quantum machine learning models
in industrial steel production applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试方法（如体积基准测试）无法全面反映量子计算机的性能变化，需要更丰富的模型。

Conclusion: 特征度量基准测试框架提供了更丰富和准确的性能模型，适用于量子计算机的性能评估。

Abstract: Benchmarks that concisely summarize the performance of many-qubit quantum
computers are essential for measuring progress towards the goal of useful
quantum computation. In this work, we present a benchmarking framework that is
based on quantifying how a quantum computer's performance on quantum circuits
varies as a function of features of those circuits, such as circuit depth,
width, two-qubit gate density, problem input size, or algorithmic depth. Our
featuremetric benchmarking framework generalizes volumetric benchmarking -- a
widely-used methodology that quantifies performance versus circuit width and
depth -- and we show that it enables richer and more faithful models of quantum
computer performance. We demonstrate featuremetric benchmarking with example
benchmarks run on IBM Q and IonQ systems of up to 27 qubits, and we show how to
produce performance summaries from the data using Gaussian process regression.
Our data analysis methods are also of interest in the special case of
volumetric benchmarking, as they enable the creation of intuitive
two-dimensional capability regions using data from few circuits.

Result: 二进制信道区分的查询复杂度与错误概率对数和信道保真度负对数相关；多信道区分的上界与信道数量对数相关。

Conclusion: 本文为量子信道区分的查询复杂度提供了理论框架，适用于经典和量子信道。

Abstract: Quantum channel discrimination has been studied from an information-theoretic
perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error
probabilities as a function of the number of unknown channel accesses. In this
paper, we study the query complexity of quantum channel discrimination, wherein
the goal is to determine the minimum number of channel uses needed to reach a
desired error probability. To this end, we show that the query complexity of
binary channel discrimination depends logarithmically on the inverse error
probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and
Holevo) channel fidelity. As a special case of these findings, we precisely
characterize the query complexity of discriminating between two classical
channels. We also provide lower and upper bounds on the query complexity of
binary asymmetric channel discrimination and multiple quantum channel
discrimination. For the former, the query complexity depends on the geometric
R\'enyi and Petz R\'enyi channel divergences, while for the latter, it depends
on the negative logarithm of (geometric and Uhlmann) channel fidelity. For
multiple channel discrimination, the upper bound scales as the logarithm of the
number of channels.

### [270] [Corner Gradient Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12519)
*Dmitry Yarotsky*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 论文研究了无限维二次问题中SGD型优化的收敛速率，提出了一种广义的带无限记忆的SGD方法，可实现接近最优的收敛速率，并通过有限内存算法高效近似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无限维二次问题中，确定性GD和Heavy Ball方法已有明确的收敛速率，但在SGD中由于采样噪声，Jacobi HB方法发散。论文旨在解决这一问题，提出一种新的SGD方法以实现更优的收敛速率。

Method: 通过将广义(S)GD算法与复平面中的轮廓关联，发现具有特定外部角的轮廓可以加速收敛。在SGD中，优化外部角以平衡加速和噪声效应，并使用快速有理近似实现有限内存算法。

Result: 证明了最优收敛速率由θ_max=min(2,ν,2/(ζ+1/ν))决定，并通过实验验证了有限内存算法的实际效率。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种新的SGD方法，在无限维二次问题中实现了接近最优的收敛速率，并通过有限内存算法展示了其实际可行性。

Abstract: We consider SGD-type optimization on infinite-dimensional quadratic problems
with power law spectral conditions. It is well-known that on such problems
deterministic GD has loss convergence rates $L_t=O(t^{-\zeta})$, which can be
improved to $L_t=O(t^{-2\zeta})$ by using Heavy Ball with a non-stationary
Jacobi-based schedule (and the latter rate is optimal among fixed schedules).
However, in the mini-batch Stochastic GD setting, the sampling noise causes the
Jacobi HB to diverge; accordingly no $O(t^{-2\zeta})$ algorithm is known. In
this paper we show that rates up to $O(t^{-2\zeta})$ can be achieved by a
generalized stationary SGD with infinite memory. We start by identifying
generalized (S)GD algorithms with contours in the complex plane. We then show
that contours that have a corner with external angle $\theta\pi$ accelerate the
plain GD rate $O(t^{-\zeta})$ to $O(t^{-\theta\zeta})$. For deterministic GD,
increasing $\theta$ allows to achieve rates arbitrarily close to
$O(t^{-2\zeta})$. However, in Stochastic GD, increasing $\theta$ also amplifies
the sampling noise, so in general $\theta$ needs to be optimized by balancing
the acceleration and noise effects. We prove that the optimal rate is given by
$\theta_{\max}=\min(2,\nu,\tfrac{2}{\zeta+1/\nu})$, where $\nu,\zeta$ are the
exponents appearing in the capacity and source spectral conditions.
Furthermore, using fast rational approximations of the power functions, we show
that ideal corner algorithms can be efficiently approximated by finite-memory
algorithms, and demonstrate their practical efficiency on a synthetic problem
and MNIST.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种关于符合松弛超鞅条件的随机过程的渐进行为的新结果，提供了收敛速率的显式构造，并应用于随机逼近中的多个经典定理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究随机过程的渐进行为，特别是松弛超鞅条件下的收敛速率，以填补现有理论中定量信息的不足。

Method: 通过显式构造收敛速率，结合松弛超鞅条件，分析随机过程的均值和几乎必然收敛性。

Result: 得出了收敛速率的显式构造，并成功应用于随机逼近中的多个经典定理（如Robbins-Siegmund定理、Dvoretzky定理等）。

Conclusion: 该结果具有广泛适用性，可推广到多种随机逼近问题，并展示了快速（如线性）收敛速率的潜力。

Abstract: We prove a novel and general result on the asymptotic behavior of stochastic
processes which conform to a certain relaxed supermartingale condition. Our
result provides quantitative information in the form of an explicit and
effective construction of a rate of convergence for this process, both in mean
and almost surely, that is moreover highly uniform in the sense that it only
depends on very few data of the surrounding objects involved in the iteration.
We then apply this result to derive new quantitative versions of well-known
concepts and theorems from stochastic approximation, in particular providing
effective rates for a variant of the Robbins-Siegmund theorem, Dvoretzky's
convergence theorem, as well as the convergence of stochastic quasi-Fej\'er
monotone sequences, the latter of which formulated in a novel and highly
general metric context. We utilize the classic and widely studied Robbins-Monro
procedure as a template to evaluate our quantitative results and their
applicability in greater detail. We conclude by illustrating the breadth of
potential further applications with a brief discussion on a variety of other
well-known iterative procedures from stochastic approximation, covering a range
of different applied scenarios to which our methods can be immediately applied.
Throughout, we isolate and discuss special cases of our results which even
allow for the construction of fast, and in particular linear, rates.

### [272] [A Two-Phase Perspective on Deep Learning Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12700)
*Robert de Mello Koch,Animik Ghosh*

TL;DR: 深度学习中的学习过程分为两个阶段：快速拟合阶段和缓慢压缩阶段，支持这一观点的现象包括grokking、双下降和信息瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨深度学习模型在学习过程中为何表现出延迟泛化的现象，并提出两阶段学习理论。

Method: 通过实证研究，分析隐藏层与输入数据之间的互信息，结合电路度量指标（如局部复杂性和线性映射数）。

Result: 发现两阶段学习的时间尺度在不同设置下对齐，压缩阶段可能未被标准训练算法主动优化。

Conclusion: 压缩阶段是一种原则性的遗忘形式，对泛化至关重要，类似于重整化群的概念。

Abstract: We propose that learning in deep neural networks proceeds in two phases: a
rapid curve fitting phase followed by a slower compression or coarse graining
phase. This view is supported by the shared temporal structure of three
phenomena: grokking, double descent and the information bottleneck, all of
which exhibit a delayed onset of generalization well after training error
reaches zero. We empirically show that the associated timescales align in two
rather different settings. Mutual information between hidden layers and input
data emerges as a natural progress measure, complementing circuit-based metrics
such as local complexity and the linear mapping number. We argue that the
second phase is not actively optimized by standard training algorithms and may
be unnecessarily prolonged. Drawing on an analogy with the renormalization
group, we suggest that this compression phase reflects a principled form of
forgetting, critical for generalization.

TL;DR: Human2Sim2Robot框架通过单段RGB-D视频训练机器人灵巧操作策略，避免了大规模数据收集和动作标注的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖穿戴设备或远程操作收集大量演示数据，难以扩展；而视频数据虽易获取，但缺乏动作标签且存在形态差异。

Method: 利用强化学习在仿真环境中跨越人-机器人形态差异，提取物体姿态轨迹和手部初始姿态作为任务指导。

Result: Human2Sim2Robot在抓取、非抓取操作和多步任务中表现优于基线方法55%和68%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过任务特定组件简化了奖励设计，实现了高效且可扩展的机器人学习。

Abstract: Teaching robots dexterous manipulation skills often requires collecting
hundreds of demonstrations using wearables or teleoperation, a process that is
challenging to scale. Videos of human-object interactions are easier to collect
and scale, but leveraging them directly for robot learning is difficult due to
the lack of explicit action labels from videos and morphological differences
between robot and human hands. We propose Human2Sim2Robot, a novel
real-to-sim-to-real framework for training dexterous manipulation policies
using only one RGB-D video of a human demonstrating a task. Our method utilizes
reinforcement learning (RL) in simulation to cross the human-robot embodiment
gap without relying on wearables, teleoperation, or large-scale data collection
typically necessary for imitation learning methods. From the demonstration, we
extract two task-specific components: (1) the object pose trajectory to define
an object-centric, embodiment-agnostic reward function, and (2) the
pre-manipulation hand pose to initialize and guide exploration during RL
training. We found that these two components are highly effective for learning
the desired task, eliminating the need for task-specific reward shaping and
tuning. We demonstrate that Human2Sim2Robot outperforms object-aware open-loop
trajectory replay by 55% and imitation learning with data augmentation by 68%
across grasping, non-prehensile manipulation, and multi-step tasks. Project

Result: 在五个真实数据集上测试，平均定位准确率为77%±2m，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效解决建筑工地中的全局定位问题，尤其在复杂和受限环境中表现优异。

Abstract: Mobile robots on construction sites require accurate pose estimation to
perform autonomous surveying and inspection missions. Localization in
construction sites is a particularly challenging problem due to the presence of
repetitive features such as flat plastered walls and perceptual aliasing due to
apartments with similar layouts inter and intra floors. In this paper, we focus
on the global re-positioning of a robot with respect to an accurate scanned
mesh of the building solely using LiDAR data. In our approach, a neural network
is trained on synthetic LiDAR point clouds generated by simulating a LiDAR in
an accurate real-life large-scale mesh. We train a diffusion model with a
PointNet++ backbone, which allows us to model multiple position candidates from
a single LiDAR point cloud. The resulting model can successfully predict the
global position of LiDAR in confined and complex sites despite the adverse
effects of perceptual aliasing. The learned distribution of potential global
positions can provide multi-modal position distribution. We evaluate our
approach across five real-world datasets and show the place recognition
accuracy of 77% +/-2m on average while outperforming baselines at a factor of 2
in mean error.

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂任务中的摩擦建模提供了可扩展且可解释的路径，有助于缩小机器人控制中的仿真与现实差距。

Abstract: Accurately modeling friction in robotics remains a core challenge, as
robotics simulators like Mujoco and PyBullet use simplified friction models or
heuristics to balance computational efficiency with accuracy, where these
simplifications and approximations can lead to substantial differences between
simulated and physical performance. In this paper, we present a
physics-informed friction estimation framework that enables the integration of
well-established friction models with learnable components-requiring only
minimal, generic measurement data. Our approach enforces physical consistency
yet retains the flexibility to adapt to real-world complexities. We
demonstrate, on an underactuated and nonlinear system, that the learned
friction models, trained solely on small and noisy datasets, accurately
simulate dynamic friction properties and reduce the sim-to-real gap. Crucially,
we show that our approach enables the learned models to be transferable to
systems they are not trained on. This ability to generalize across multiple
systems streamlines friction modeling for complex, underactuated tasks,
offering a scalable and interpretable path toward bridging the sim-to-real gap
in robotics and control.

Abstract: Adapting robot trajectories based on human instructions as per new situations
is essential for achieving more intuitive and scalable human-robot
interactions. This work proposes a flexible language-based framework to adapt
generic robotic trajectories produced by off-the-shelf motion planners like
RRT, A-star, etc, or learned from human demonstrations. We utilize pre-trained
LLMs to adapt trajectory waypoints by generating code as a policy for dense
robot manipulation, enabling more complex and flexible instructions than
current methods. This approach allows us to incorporate a broader range of
commands, including numerical inputs. Compared to state-of-the-art
feature-based sequence-to-sequence models which require training, our method
does not require task-specific training and offers greater interpretability and
more effective feedback mechanisms. We validate our approach through simulation
experiments on the robotic manipulator, aerial vehicle, and ground robot in the
Pybullet and Gazebo simulation environments, demonstrating that LLMs can
successfully adapt trajectories to complex human instructions.

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of graph neural networks (GNNs) with
Qualitative Explainable Graphs (QXGs) for scene understanding in automated
driving. Scene understanding is the basis for any further reactive or proactive
decision-making. Scene understanding and related reasoning is inherently an
explanation task: why is another traffic participant doing something, what or
who caused their actions? While previous work demonstrated QXGs' effectiveness
using shallow machine learning models, these approaches were limited to
analysing single relation chains between object pairs, disregarding the broader
scene context. We propose a novel GNN architecture that processes entire graph
structures to identify relevant objects in traffic scenes. We evaluate our
method on the nuScenes dataset enriched with DriveLM's human-annotated
relevance labels. Experimental results show that our GNN-based approach
achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods. The model
effectively handles the inherent class imbalance in relevant object
identification tasks while considering the complete spatial-temporal
relationships between all objects in the scene. Our work demonstrates the
potential of combining qualitative representations with deep learning
approaches for explainable scene understanding in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: In the rapidly advancing field of robotics, dual-arm coordination and complex
object manipulation are essential capabilities for developing advanced
autonomous systems. However, the scarcity of diverse, high-quality
demonstration data and real-world-aligned evaluation benchmarks severely limits
such development. To address this, we introduce RoboTwin, a generative digital
twin framework that uses 3D generative foundation models and large language
models to produce diverse expert datasets and provide a real-world-aligned
evaluation platform for dual-arm robotic tasks. Specifically, RoboTwin creates
varied digital twins of objects from single 2D images, generating realistic and
interactive scenarios. It also introduces a spatial relation-aware code
generation framework that combines object annotations with large language
models to break down tasks, determine spatial constraints, and generate precise
robotic movement code. Our framework offers a comprehensive benchmark with both
simulated and real-world data, enabling standardized evaluation and better
alignment between simulated training and real-world performance. We validated
our approach using the open-source COBOT Magic Robot platform. Policies
pre-trained on RoboTwin-generated data and fine-tuned with limited real-world
samples demonstrate significant potential for enhancing dual-arm robotic
manipulation systems by improving success rates by over 70% for single-arm
tasks and over 40% for dual-arm tasks compared to models trained solely on
real-world data.

Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶方法依赖确定性建模的在线地图，可能引入感知错误，影响规划安全性。

Method: UncAD首先估计感知模块中在线地图的不确定性，利用不确定性指导多模态轨迹生成，并提出不确定性碰撞感知的规划选择策略。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，UncAD仅增加1.9%参数，碰撞率降低26%，可行驶区域冲突率降低42%。

Conclusion: UncAD通过不确定性建模显著提升自动驾驶安全性，适用于多种SOTA端到端方法。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving aims to produce planning trajectories from raw
sensors directly. Currently, most approaches integrate perception, prediction,
and planning modules into a fully differentiable network, promising great
scalability. However, these methods typically rely on deterministic modeling of
online maps in the perception module for guiding or constraining vehicle
planning, which may incorporate erroneous perception information and further
compromise planning safety. To address this issue, we delve into the importance
of online map uncertainty for enhancing autonomous driving safety and propose a
novel paradigm named UncAD. Specifically, UncAD first estimates the uncertainty
of the online map in the perception module. It then leverages the uncertainty
to guide motion prediction and planning modules to produce multi-modal
trajectories. Finally, to achieve safer autonomous driving, UncAD proposes an
uncertainty-collision-aware planning selection strategy according to the online
map uncertainty to evaluate and select the best trajectory. In this study, we
incorporate UncAD into various state-of-the-art (SOTA) end-to-end methods.
Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that integrating UncAD, with only a
1.9% increase in parameters, can reduce collision rates by up to 26% and
drivable area conflict rate by up to 42%. Codes, pre-trained models, and demo
videos can be accessed at https://github.com/pengxuanyang/UncAD.

Abstract: Tactile sensing is crucial for achieving human-level robotic capabilities in
manipulation tasks. VBTSs have emerged as a promising solution, offering high
spatial resolution and cost-effectiveness by sensing contact through
camera-captured deformation patterns of elastic gel pads. However, these
sensors' complex physical characteristics and visual signal processing
requirements present unique challenges for robotic applications. The lack of
efficient and accurate simulation tools for VBTS has significantly limited the
scale and scope of tactile robotics research. Here we present Taccel, a
high-performance simulation platform that integrates IPC and ABD to model
robots, tactile sensors, and objects with both accuracy and unprecedented
speed, achieving an 18-fold acceleration over real-time across thousands of
parallel environments. Unlike previous simulators that operate at sub-real-time
speeds with limited parallelization, Taccel provides precise physics simulation
and realistic tactile signals while supporting flexible robot-sensor
configurations through user-friendly APIs. Through extensive validation in
object recognition, robotic grasping, and articulated object manipulation, we
demonstrate precise simulation and successful sim-to-real transfer. These
capabilities position Taccel as a powerful tool for scaling up tactile robotics
research and development. By enabling large-scale simulation and
experimentation with tactile sensing, Taccel accelerates the development of
more capable robotic systems, potentially transforming how robots interact with

Abstract: Object 6D pose estimation is a critical challenge in robotics, particularly
for manipulation tasks. While prior research combining visual and tactile
(visuotactile) information has shown promise, these approaches often struggle
with generalization due to the limited availability of visuotactile data. In
this paper, we introduce ViTa-Zero, a zero-shot visuotactile pose estimation
framework. Our key innovation lies in leveraging a visual model as its backbone
and performing feasibility checking and test-time optimization based on
physical constraints derived from tactile and proprioceptive observations.
Specifically, we model the gripper-object interaction as a spring-mass system,
where tactile sensors induce attractive forces, and proprioception generates
repulsive forces. We validate our framework through experiments on a real-world
robot setup, demonstrating its effectiveness across representative visual
backbones and manipulation scenarios, including grasping, object picking, and
bimanual handover. Compared to the visual models, our approach overcomes some
drastic failure modes while tracking the in-hand object pose. In our
experiments, our approach shows an average increase of 55% in AUC of ADD-S and
60% in ADD, along with an 80% lower position error compared to FoundationPose.

Method: RUKA采用3D打印和现成组件设计，具有15个欠驱动自由度。通过从MANUS手套的运动捕捉数据中学习关节-执行器和指尖-执行器模型，解决了控制问题。

Result: RUKA在可达性、耐用性和强度方面优于其他机械手，并通过遥操作任务展示了其灵巧性。

Conclusion: RUKA的开源设计、代码和数据为灵巧机械手的研究和应用提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation is a fundamental capability for robotic systems, yet
progress has been limited by hardware trade-offs between precision,
compactness, strength, and affordability. Existing control methods impose
compromises on hand designs and applications. However, learning-based
approaches present opportunities to rethink these trade-offs, particularly to
address challenges with tendon-driven actuation and low-cost materials. This
work presents RUKA, a tendon-driven humanoid hand that is compact, affordable,
and capable. Made from 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf components, RUKA has
5 fingers with 15 underactuated degrees of freedom enabling diverse human-like
grasps. Its tendon-driven actuation allows powerful grasping in a compact,
human-sized form factor. To address control challenges, we learn
joint-to-actuator and fingertip-to-actuator models from motion-capture data
collected by the MANUS glove, leveraging the hand's morphological accuracy.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate RUKA's superior reachability, durability, and
strength compared to other robotic hands. Teleoperation tasks further showcase
RUKA's dexterous movements. The open-source design and assembly instructions of
RUKA, code, and data are available at https://ruka-hand.github.io/.

Motivation: 原型分析提供了一种直观且可解释的高维数据表示方法，但其优化问题非凸，存在挑战。本文旨在总结AA的方法、应用及最佳实践。

Method: 综述了AA的计算方法、数据建模最佳实践及其局限性。

Result: AA在多个科学领域有广泛应用，但其非凸优化问题仍需解决。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注AA的优化问题及其在新领域的应用。

Abstract: Archetypal analysis (AA) was originally proposed in 1994 by Adele Cutler and
Leo Breiman as a computational procedure to extract the distinct aspects called
archetypes in observations with each observational record approximated as a
mixture (i.e., convex combination) of these archetypes. AA thereby provides
straightforward, interpretable, and explainable representations for feature
extraction and dimensionality reduction, facilitating the understanding of the
structure of high-dimensional data with wide applications throughout the
sciences. However, AA also faces challenges, particularly as the associated
optimization problem is non-convex. This survey provides researchers and data
mining practitioners an overview of methodologies and opportunities that AA has
to offer surveying the many applications of AA across disparate fields of
science, as well as best practices for modeling data using AA and limitations.
The survey concludes by explaining important future research directions
concerning AA.

Motivation: 针对功能数据的高维聚类问题，扩展了有限维多元数据中基于偏态分布的聚类加权模型。

Method: 基于功能线性回归模型和三种偏态多元分布（方差-伽马分布、偏态-t分布、正态逆高斯分布），构建EM算法进行参数估计。

Result: 在模拟数据和空气质量数据集上验证了方法的性能。

Conclusion: funWeightClustSkew方法在功能数据聚类中表现良好，适用于高维数据。

Abstract: We propose a clustering method, funWeightClustSkew, based on mixtures of
functional linear regression models and three skewed multivariate
distributions: the variance-gamma distribution, the skew-t distribution, and
the normal-inverse Gaussian distribution. Our approach follows the framework of
the functional high dimensional data clustering (funHDDC) method, and we extend
to functional data the cluster weighted models based on skewed distributions
used for finite dimensional multivariate data. We consider several parsimonious
models, and to estimate the parameters we construct an expectation maximization
(EM) algorithm. We illustrate the performance of funWeightClustSkew for
simulated data and for the Air Quality dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究匿名公共公告的逻辑特性，以理解在何种情况下公告者的身份可能被揭示，以及公告意图对信息传递的影响。

Method: 首先分析无意图假设的情况，证明其可归约为认知逻辑；然后研究共同知识意图的情况，探讨其与“安全”公告的关系。

Result: 提出了形式化的表达结果，并证明了关键逻辑语言的公理完备性。

Conclusion: 匿名公共公告在特定条件下可能揭示公告者身份，意图的共同知识增加了逻辑复杂性，与“安全”公告概念相关。

Abstract: We formalise the notion of an \emph{anonymous public announcement} in the
tradition of public announcement logic. Such announcements can be seen as
in-between a public announcement from ``the outside" (an announcement of
$\phi$) and a public announcement by one of the agents (an announcement of
$K_a\phi$): we get more information than just $\phi$, but not (necessarily)
about exactly who made it. Even if such an announcement is prima facie
anonymous, depending on the background knowledge of the agents it might reveal
the identity of the announcer: if I post something on a message board, the
information might reveal who I am even if I don't sign my name. Furthermore,
like in the Russian Cards puzzle, if we assume that the announcer's intention
was to stay anonymous, that in fact might reveal more information. In this
paper we first look at the case when no assumption about intentions are made,
in which case the logic with an anonymous public announcement operator is
reducible to epistemic logic. We then look at the case when we assume common
knowledge of the intention to stay anonymous, which is both more complex and
more interesting: in several ways it boils down to the notion of a ``safe"
announcement (again, similarly to Russian Cards). Main results include formal
expressivity results and axiomatic completeness for key logical languages.

Motivation: 解决现有协作模型无法泛化到新任务或新伙伴的问题，探索如何通过多环境训练提升智能体的通用协作能力。

Method: 引入两个基于Jax的过程生成器，创建数十亿个可解决的协作挑战，并提出跨环境协作（CEC）新范式。

Result: CEC在定量和定性上优于基线方法，尤其在与人协作时表现突出。

Conclusion: 多场景协作训练促使智能体发展通用规范，为设计无需人类数据的通用协作智能体提供了新思路。

Abstract: Zero-shot coordination (ZSC), the ability to adapt to a new partner in a
cooperative task, is a critical component of human-compatible AI. While prior
work has focused on training agents to cooperate on a single task, these
specialized models do not generalize to new tasks, even if they are highly
similar. Here, we study how reinforcement learning on a distribution of
environments with a single partner enables learning general cooperative skills
that support ZSC with many new partners on many new problems. We introduce two
Jax-based, procedural generators that create billions of solvable coordination
challenges. We develop a new paradigm called Cross-Environment Cooperation
(CEC), and show that it outperforms competitive baselines quantitatively and
qualitatively when collaborating with real people. Our findings suggest that
learning to collaborate across many unique scenarios encourages agents to
develop general norms, which prove effective for collaboration with different
partners. Together, our results suggest a new route toward designing generalist
cooperative agents capable of interacting with humans without requiring human
data.

Abstract: This paper proposes the "Academy of Athens" multi-agent seven-layer
framework, aimed at systematically addressing challenges in multi-agent systems
(MAS) within artificial intelligence (AI) art creation, such as collaboration
efficiency, role allocation, environmental adaptation, and task parallelism.
The framework divides MAS into seven layers: multi-agent collaboration,
single-agent multi-role playing, single-agent multi-scene traversal,
single-agent multi-capability incarnation, different single agents using the
same large model to achieve the same target agent, single-agent using different
large models to achieve the same target agent, and multi-agent synthesis of the
same target agent. Through experimental validation in art creation, the
framework demonstrates its unique advantages in task collaboration, cross-scene
adaptation, and model fusion. This paper further discusses current challenges
such as collaboration mechanism optimization, model stability, and system
security, proposing future exploration through technologies like meta-learning
and federated learning. The framework provides a structured methodology for
multi-agent collaboration in AI art creation and promotes innovative

Method: 提出通过多智能体强化学习（MARL）增强气候模拟，优化政策路径，并探讨了奖励定义、可扩展性、不确定性传播和解决方案验证等关键挑战。

Result: 框架为更复杂的气候政策探索提供了基础，同时指出了MARL解决方案在可解释性和实用性方面的局限。

Conclusion: 该框架为未来研究提供了方向，但需进一步解决MARL在政策制定中的实际应用问题。

Abstract: Climate policy development faces significant challenges due to deep
uncertainty, complex system dynamics, and competing stakeholder interests.
Climate simulation methods, such as Earth System Models, have become valuable
tools for policy exploration. However, their typical use is for evaluating
potential polices, rather than directly synthesizing them. The problem can be
inverted to optimize for policy pathways, but the traditional optimization
approaches often struggle with non-linear dynamics, heterogeneous agents, and
comprehensive uncertainty quantification. We propose a framework for augmenting
climate simulations with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to address
these limitations. We identify key challenges at the interface between climate
simulations and the application of MARL in the context of policy synthesis,
including reward definition, scalability with increasing agents and state
spaces, uncertainty propagation across linked systems, and solution validation.
Additionally, we discuss challenges in making MARL-derived solutions
interpretable and useful for policy-makers. Our framework provides a foundation
for more sophisticated climate policy exploration while acknowledging important
limitations and areas for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体强化学习中的信用分配问题尚未完全解决，现有方法存在贡献分配不精确、可解释性差和扩展性不足等问题。

Method: 提出QLLM算法，利用LLM自动构建信用分配函数，引入TFCAF概念表示非线性功能关系，并通过coder-evaluator框架优化代码生成和验证。

Result: 在多个标准MARL基准测试中，QLLM表现优于现有方法，并展现出强泛化能力和广泛兼容性。

Conclusion: QLLM为复杂多智能体场景提供了一种高效且通用的信用分配解决方案。

Abstract: Credit assignment has remained a fundamental challenge in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Previous studies have primarily addressed this
issue through value decomposition methods under the centralized training with
decentralized execution paradigm, where neural networks are utilized to
approximate the nonlinear relationship between individual Q-values and the
global Q-value. Although these approaches have achieved considerable success in
various benchmark tasks, they still suffer from several limitations, including
imprecise attribution of contributions, limited interpretability, and poor
scalability in high-dimensional state spaces. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel algorithm, \textbf{QLLM}, which facilitates the automatic
construction of credit assignment functions using large language models (LLMs).
Specifically, the concept of \textbf{TFCAF} is introduced, wherein the credit
allocation process is represented as a direct and expressive nonlinear
functional formulation. A custom-designed \textit{coder-evaluator} framework is
further employed to guide the generation, verification, and refinement of
executable code by LLMs, significantly mitigating issues such as hallucination
and shallow reasoning during inference. Extensive experiments conducted on
several standard MARL benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, QLLM
exhibits strong generalization capability and maintains compatibility with a
wide range of MARL algorithms that utilize mixing networks, positioning it as a
promising and versatile solution for complex multi-agent scenarios.

Motivation: 储层计算机（RCs）虽然计算高效，但对超参数敏感，且忽略了神经元动态中的兴奋-抑制平衡。本文旨在通过动态调整E-I平衡，提升RC的性能和鲁棒性。

Method: 引入了一种自适应的机制，局部调整E-I平衡以实现目标神经元放电率，并结合脑启发的异质性设计。

Result: 在记忆能力和时间序列预测等任务中，性能提升高达130%，且在多种任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 动态适应机制显著提升了RC的性能和鲁棒性，为储层设计提供了新的方向，并深化了对神经计算的理解。

Abstract: Reservoir computers (RCs) provide a computationally efficient alternative to
deep learning while also offering a framework for incorporating brain-inspired
computational principles. By using an internal neural network with random,
fixed connections$-$the 'reservoir'$-$and training only the output weights, RCs
simplify the training process but remain sensitive to the choice of
hyperparameters that govern activation functions and network architecture.
Moreover, typical RC implementations overlook a critical aspect of neuronal
dynamics: the balance between excitatory and inhibitory (E-I) signals, which is
essential for robust brain function. We show that RCs characteristically
perform best in balanced or slightly over-inhibited regimes, outperforming
excitation-dominated ones. To reduce the need for precise hyperparameter
tuning, we introduce a self-adapting mechanism that locally adjusts E/I balance
to achieve target neuronal firing rates, improving performance by up to 130% in
tasks like memory capacity and time series prediction compared with globally
tuned RCs. Incorporating brain-inspired heterogeneity in target neuronal firing
rates further reduces the need for fine-tuning hyperparameters and enables RCs
to excel across linear and non-linear tasks. These results support a shift from
static optimization to dynamic adaptation in reservoir design, demonstrating
how brain-inspired mechanisms improve RC performance and robustness while
deepening our understanding of neural computation.

Conclusion: CSegSynth为个体化脑MRI分割提供了一种高效且低成本的方法。

Abstract: To the best of our knowledge, all existing methods that can generate
synthetic brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for a specific
individual require detailed structural or volumetric information about the
individual's brain. However, such brain information is often scarce, expensive,
and difficult to obtain. In this paper, we propose the first approach capable
of generating synthetic brain MRI segmentations -- specifically, 3D white
matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) segmentations --
for individuals using their easily obtainable and often readily available
demographic, interview, and cognitive test information. Our approach features a
novel deep generative model, CSegSynth, which outperforms existing prominent
generative models, including conditional variational autoencoder (C-VAE),
conditional generative adversarial network (C-GAN), and conditional latent
diffusion model (C-LDM). We demonstrate the high quality of our synthetic
segmentations through extensive evaluations. Also, in assessing the
effectiveness of the individual-specific generation, we achieve superior volume
prediction, with Pearson correlation coefficients reaching 0.80, 0.82, and 0.70
between the ground-truth WM, GM, and CSF volumes of test individuals and those
volumes predicted based on generated individual-specific segmentations,
respectively.

Abstract: Data-driven methods have shown potential in electric-vehicle battery
management tasks such as capacity estimation, but their deployment is
bottlenecked by poor performance in data-limited scenarios. Sharing battery
data among algorithm developers can enable accurate and generalizable
data-driven models. However, an effective battery management framework that
simultaneously ensures data privacy and fault tolerance is still lacking. This
paper proposes a swarm battery management system that unites a decentralized
swarm learning (SL) framework and credibility weight-based model merging
mechanism to enhance battery capacity estimation in data-limited scenarios
while ensuring data privacy and security. The effectiveness of the SL framework
is validated on a dataset comprising 66 commercial LiNiCoAlO2 cells cycled
under various operating conditions. Specifically, the capacity estimation
performance is validated in four cases, including data-balanced, volume-biased,
feature-biased, and quality-biased scenarios. Our results show that SL can
enhance the estimation accuracy in all data-limited cases and achieve a similar
level of accuracy with central learning where large amounts of data are
available.

Abstract: Underwater acoustic target recognition (UATR) is of great significance for
the protection of marine diversity and national defense security. The
development of deep learning provides new opportunities for UATR, but faces
challenges brought by the scarcity of reference samples and complex
environmental interference. To address these issues, we proposes a multi-task
balanced channel attention convolutional neural network (MT-BCA-CNN). The
method integrates a channel attention mechanism with a multi-task learning
strategy, constructing a shared feature extractor and multi-task classifiers to
jointly optimize target classification and feature reconstruction tasks. The
channel attention mechanism dynamically enhances discriminative acoustic
features such as harmonic structures while suppressing noise. Experiments on
the Watkins Marine Life Dataset demonstrate that MT-BCA-CNN achieves 97\%
classification accuracy and 95\% $F1$-score in 27-class few-shot scenarios,
significantly outperforming traditional CNN and ACNN models, as well as popular
state-of-the-art UATR methods. Ablation studies confirm the synergistic
benefits of multi-task learning and attention mechanisms, while a dynamic
weighting adjustment strategy effectively balances task contributions. This
work provides an efficient solution for few-shot underwater acoustic
recognition, advancing research in marine bioacoustics and sonar signal
processing.

Abstract: High-stakes domains like cyber operations need responsible and trustworthy AI
methods. While large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly popular
in these domains, they still suffer from hallucinations. This research paper
provides learning outcomes from a case study with LinkQ, an open-source natural
language interface that was developed to combat hallucinations by forcing an
LLM to query a knowledge graph (KG) for ground-truth data during
question-answering (QA). We conduct a quantitative evaluation of LinkQ using a
well-known KGQA dataset, showing that the system outperforms GPT-4 but still
struggles with certain question categories - suggesting that alternative query
construction strategies will need to be investigated in future LLM querying
systems. We discuss a qualitative study of LinkQ with two domain experts using
a real-world cybersecurity KG, outlining these experts' feedback, suggestions,
perceived limitations, and future opportunities for systems like LinkQ.

Motivation: 当前XAI研究中，LLM被用于将技术输出转化为自然语言解释，但其可能强化用户对AI的过度依赖而非真正透明。

Method: 提出LLM不应仅作为翻译工具，而应主动质疑AI解释，提供替代解读、潜在偏见及模型局限性。

Result: LLM作为质疑者有助于用户批判性思考，减少因误解解释而产生的过度依赖。

Conclusion: LLM在XAI中应扮演质疑者角色，而非简单翻译工具，以提升透明度和用户理解。

Abstract: This position paper highlights a growing trend in Explainable AI (XAI)
research where Large Language Models (LLMs) are used to translate outputs from
explainability techniques, like feature-attribution weights, into a natural
language explanation. While this approach may improve accessibility or
readability for users, recent findings suggest that translating into human-like
explanations does not necessarily enhance user understanding and may instead
lead to overreliance on AI systems. When LLMs summarize XAI outputs without
surfacing model limitations, uncertainties, or inconsistencies, they risk
reinforcing the illusion of interpretability rather than fostering meaningful
transparency. We argue that - instead of merely translating XAI outputs - LLMs
should serve as constructive agitators, or devil's advocates, whose role is to
actively interrogate AI explanations by presenting alternative interpretations,
potential biases, training data limitations, and cases where the model's

critically with AI systems and generated explanations, with the potential to

*Mohi Reza,Jeb Thomas-Mitchell,Peter Dushniku,Nathan Laundry,Joseph Jay Williams,Anastasia Kuzminykh*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文探讨了生成式AI工具（如ChatGPT）对写作过程中作者代理感和所有权的影响，通过系统综述和访谈揭示了不同写作阶段AI干预的偏好差异，并提出了以人为中心的AI写作工具设计策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI工具在日常写作中的普及，如何保持作者的代理感和所有权成为关键问题，但目前缺乏系统研究。

Method: 采用PRISMA方法系统综述了109篇HCI论文，并访谈了15位跨领域作者。

Result: 发现作者对AI干预的偏好因写作阶段和领域而异，内容型作者（如学者）重视规划阶段的所有权，而形式型作者（如创意者）关注翻译和修订阶段的控制。

Conclusion: 研究为设计以人为中心的AI写作工具提供了实用指导，强调了在AI协作中尊重作者代理感和所有权的重要性。

Abstract: As generative AI tools like ChatGPT become integral to everyday writing,
critical questions arise about how to preserve writers' sense of agency and
ownership when using these tools. Yet, a systematic understanding of how AI
assistance affects different aspects of the writing process - and how this
shapes writers' agency - remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
conducted a systematic review of 109 HCI papers using the PRISMA approach. From
this literature, we identify four overarching design strategies for AI writing
support: structured guidance, guided exploration, active co-writing, and
critical feedback - mapped across the four key cognitive processes in writing:
planning, translating, reviewing, and monitoring. We complement this analysis
with interviews of 15 writers across diverse domains. Our findings reveal that
writers' desired levels of AI intervention vary across the writing process:
content-focused writers (e.g., academics) prioritize ownership during planning,
while form-focused writers (e.g., creatives) value control over translating and
reviewing. Writers' preferences are also shaped by contextual goals, values,
and notions of originality and authorship. By examining when ownership matters,
what writers want to own, and how AI interactions shape agency, we surface both
alignment and gaps between research and user needs. Our findings offer
actionable design guidance for developing human-centered writing tools for
co-writing with AI, on human terms.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该论文研究AI增强推理在HCI、心理学和认知科学中的应用，重点探讨多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉感知任务中的适用性，并提出一种无标注的分析框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过结合心理学和认知科学的原理，评估MLLMs作为认知助手在HCI任务中的实用性，以视觉感知为例，旨在量化MLLMs的可解释性并揭示人类标注数据集中的偏见。

Method: 利用心理学和认知科学的复杂性原则指导MLLMs解释视觉内容，提出无标注的分析框架，而非开发新的预测模型。

Result: 论文为量化MLLMs的可解释性提供了新方法，并展示了其在提升人类推理能力和发现数据集偏见方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 该研究为MLLMs在HCI任务中的评估和应用提供了理论基础，强调了其在改善人类推理和揭示偏见方面的价值。

Abstract: In this paper, we advance the study of AI-augmented reasoning in the context
of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), psychology and cognitive science, focusing
on the critical task of visual perception. Specifically, we investigate the
applicability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in this domain. To
this end, we leverage established principles and explanations from psychology
and cognitive science related to complexity in human visual perception. We use
them as guiding principles for the MLLMs to compare and interprete visual
content. Our study aims to benchmark MLLMs across various explainability
principles relevant to visual perception. Unlike recent approaches that
primarily employ advanced deep learning models to predict complexity metrics
from visual content, our work does not seek to develop a mere new predictive
model. Instead, we propose a novel annotation-free analytical framework to
assess utility of MLLMs as cognitive assistants for HCI tasks, using visual
perception as a case study. The primary goal is to pave the way for principled
study in quantifying and evaluating the interpretability of MLLMs for
applications in improving human reasoning capability and uncovering biases in
existing perception datasets annotated by humans.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: MobilePoser是一种实时系统，利用消费设备中的IMU进行全身姿态和全局平移估计，解决了传感器噪声和漂移带来的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着运动捕捉技术向低精度IMU迁移，传感器噪声和漂移导致在线性能、时间一致性和全局平移丢失等问题。

Method: 采用多阶段深度神经网络进行运动姿态估计，并结合基于物理的运动优化器。

Result: 实现了最先进的精度，同时保持轻量级。

Conclusion: MobilePoser在健康、游戏和室内导航等领域具有独特潜力。

Abstract: There has been a continued trend towards minimizing instrumentation for
full-body motion capture, going from specialized rooms and equipment, to arrays
of worn sensors and recently sparse inertial pose capture methods. However, as
these techniques migrate towards lower-fidelity IMUs on ubiquitous commodity
devices, like phones, watches, and earbuds, challenges arise including
compromised online performance, temporal consistency, and loss of global
translation due to sensor noise and drift. Addressing these challenges, we
introduce MobilePoser, a real-time system for full-body pose and global
translation estimation using any available subset of IMUs already present in
these consumer devices. MobilePoser employs a multi-stage deep neural network
for kinematic pose estimation followed by a physics-based motion optimizer,
achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while remaining lightweight. We conclude
with a series of demonstrative applications to illustrate the unique potential
of MobilePoser across a variety of fields, such as health and wellness, gaming,
and indoor navigation to name a few.

TL;DR: 统计后处理方法适用于AI天气模型，与传统NWP模型结合可提升预报技能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI天气模型虽性能接近业务级，但仍存在系统偏差和可靠性问题，需验证统计后处理方法的适用性。

Method: 测试IMPROVER统计后处理系统对ECMWF的AIFS模型的效果，并与传统NWP模型（HRES和ENS）对比。

Result: 后处理显著提升AIFS的准确性，与传统NWP效果相当；结合AI与NWP模型可进一步提高预报技能。

Conclusion: 现有NWP后处理方法可直接用于AI模型，为气象中心提供低风险、渐进式的AI整合方案。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) weather models are now reaching
operational-grade performance for some variables, but like traditional
Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, they exhibit systematic biases and
reliability issues. We test the application of the Bureau of Meteorology's
existing statistical post-processing system, IMPROVER, to ECMWF's deterministic
Artificial Intelligence Forecasting System (AIFS), and compare results against
post-processed outputs from the ECMWF HRES and ENS models. Without any
modification to configuration or processing workflows, post-processing yields
comparable accuracy improvements for AIFS as for traditional NWP forecasts, in
both expected value and probabilistic outputs. We show that blending AIFS with
NWP models improves overall forecast skill, even when AIFS alone is not the
most accurate component. These findings show that statistical post-processing
methods developed for NWP are directly applicable to AI models, enabling
national meteorological centres to incorporate AI forecasts into existing
workflows in a low-risk, incremental fashion.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需显式访问生成模型分布的黑盒隐写方案，通过动态采样策略实现高效且安全的秘密通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可证明安全隐写（PSS）方法需显式访问生成模型分布，限制了黑盒场景下的实用性。

Method: 采用动态采样策略，使生成模型在不干扰正常生成过程的情况下嵌入秘密消息。

Result: 在三个真实数据集和三个LLM上的评估表明，该方法在效率和容量上与现有白盒方法相当，且避免了模型输出质量的下降。

Conclusion: 该黑盒隐写方案为安全通信提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The security of private communication is increasingly at risk due to
widespread surveillance. Steganography, a technique for embedding secret
messages within innocuous carriers, enables covert communication over monitored
channels. Provably Secure Steganography (PSS) is state of the art for making
stego carriers indistinguishable from normal ones by ensuring computational
indistinguishability between stego and cover distributions. However, current
PSS methods often require explicit access to the distribution of generative
model for both sender and receiver, limiting their practicality in black box
scenarios. In this paper, we propose a provably secure steganography scheme
that does not require access to explicit model distributions for both sender
and receiver. Our method incorporates a dynamic sampling strategy, enabling
generative models to embed secret messages within multiple sampling choices
without disrupting the normal generation process of the model. Extensive
evaluations of three real world datasets and three LLMs demonstrate that our
blackbox method is comparable with existing white-box steganography methods in
terms of efficiency and capacity while eliminating the degradation of
steganography in model generated outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Agentic AI的普及，数据孤岛和定制化集成问题限制了其扩展性，MCP协议虽提供了通用标准，但引入了新的安全风险。

Method: 提出MCP Guardian框架，结合多种安全措施（如认证、WAF扫描等），通过实际场景和测试验证其有效性。

Result: MCP Guardian能有效抵御攻击，确保数据完整性，且开销较小。

Conclusion: MCP Guardian为AI助手提供了安全、可扩展的数据访问方案，强调了多层次防御在AI环境中的重要性。

Abstract: As Agentic AI gain mainstream adoption, the industry invests heavily in model
capabilities, achieving rapid leaps in reasoning and quality. However, these
systems remain largely confined to data silos, and each new integration
requires custom logic that is difficult to scale. The Model Context Protocol
(MCP) addresses this challenge by defining a universal, open standard for
securely connecting AI-based applications (MCP clients) to data sources (MCP
servers). However, the flexibility of the MCP introduces new risks, including
malicious tool servers and compromised data integrity. We present MCP Guardian,
a framework that strengthens MCP-based communication with authentication,
rate-limiting, logging, tracing, and Web Application Firewall (WAF) scanning.
Through real-world scenarios and empirical testing, we demonstrate how MCP
Guardian effectively mitigates attacks and ensures robust oversight with
minimal overheads. Our approach fosters secure, scalable data access for AI
assistants, underscoring the importance of a defense-in-depth approach that
enables safer and more transparent innovation in AI-driven environments.

TL;DR: EmoVoice是一种新型情感可控TTS模型，利用LLM实现细粒度自然语言情感控制，并通过音素增强设计提升内容一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTS模型在情感表达控制方面存在不足，EmoVoice旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合LLM实现情感控制，采用音素增强设计，并引入高质量情感数据集EmoVoice-DB。

Result: 在英语和中文测试集上达到SOTA性能，并探索了情感评估指标的可靠性。

Conclusion: EmoVoice在情感可控TTS领域表现优异，未来将公开数据集和代码。

Abstract: Human speech goes beyond the mere transfer of information; it is a profound
exchange of emotions and a connection between individuals. While Text-to-Speech
(TTS) models have made huge progress, they still face challenges in controlling
the emotional expression in the generated speech. In this work, we propose
EmoVoice, a novel emotion-controllable TTS model that exploits large language
models (LLMs) to enable fine-grained freestyle natural language emotion
control, and a phoneme boost variant design that makes the model output phoneme
tokens and audio tokens in parallel to enhance content consistency, inspired by
chain-of-thought (CoT) and modality-of-thought (CoM) techniques. Besides, we
introduce EmoVoice-DB, a high-quality 40-hour English emotion dataset featuring
expressive speech and fine-grained emotion labels with natural language
descriptions. EmoVoice achieves state-of-the-art performance on the English
EmoVoice-DB test set using only synthetic training data, and on the Chinese
Secap test set using our in-house data. We further investigate the reliability
of existing emotion evaluation metrics and their alignment with human
perceptual preferences, and explore using SOTA multimodal LLMs GPT-4o-audio and
Gemini to assess emotional speech. Demo samples are available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EmoVoice-DF55. Dataset, code, and checkpoints

Motivation: 传统方法在寻找具有完整带隙的拓扑绝缘体（TIs）和拓扑晶体绝缘体（TCIs）时效率低下，因此需要开发新方法生成这类材料。

Method: 采用预训练的生成模型，并通过强化微调（ReFT）优化模型目标，使其更符合材料设计需求。

Result: ReFT显著提升了模型生成TIs和TCIs的能力，同时保持了材料的稳定性。成功发现新材料Ge$_2$Bi$_2$O$_6$，其带隙为0.26 eV。

Conclusion: 生成模型结合ReFT是一种高效设计拓扑材料的方法，为未来材料发现提供了新思路。

Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) and topological crystalline insulators (TCIs)
are materials with unconventional electronic properties, making their discovery
highly valuable for practical applications. However, such materials,
particularly those with a full band gap, remain scarce. Given the limitations
of traditional approaches that scan known materials for candidates, we focus on
the generation of new topological materials through a generative model.
Specifically, we apply reinforcement fine-tuning (ReFT) to a pre-trained
generative model, thereby aligning the model's objectives with our material
design goals. We demonstrate that ReFT is effective in enhancing the model's
ability to generate TIs and TCIs, with minimal compromise on the stability of
the generated materials. Using the fine-tuned model, we successfully identify a
large number of new topological materials, with Ge$_2$Bi$_2$O$_6$ serving as a
representative example--a TI with a full band gap of 0.26 eV, ranking among the
largest known in this category.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）生成代码中的重复问题，提出了DeRep技术以减少重复并提升代码质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的代码存在重复问题，影响效率和可读性，需研究其普遍性并提出解决方案。

Method: 通过定量和定性分析19种先进代码LLM，总结20种重复模式，并提出规则化技术DeRep。

Result: DeRep显著减少重复（指标提升79.9%-93.5%）并提高代码质量（Pass@1提升208.3%）。

Conclusion: DeRep有效解决了代码重复问题，并提升了现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation,
the quality of LLM-generated code still faces significant challenges. One
significant issue is code repetition, which refers to the model's tendency to
generate structurally redundant code, resulting in inefficiencies and reduced
readability. To address this, we conduct the first empirical study to
investigate the prevalence and nature of repetition across 19 state-of-the-art
code LLMs using three widely-used benchmarks. Our study includes both
quantitative and qualitative analyses, revealing that repetition is pervasive
and manifests at various granularities and extents, including character,
statement, and block levels. We further summarize a taxonomy of 20 repetition
patterns. Building on our findings, we propose DeRep, a rule-based technique
designed to detect and mitigate repetition in generated code. We evaluate DeRep
using both open-source benchmarks and in an industrial setting. Our results
demonstrate that DeRep significantly outperforms baselines in reducing
repetition (with an average improvements of 91.3%, 93.5%, and 79.9% in rep-3,
rep-line, and sim-line metrics) and enhancing code quality (with a Pass@1
increase of 208.3% over greedy search). Furthermore, integrating DeRep improves
the performance of existing repetition mitigation methods, with Pass@1
improvements ranging from 53.7% to 215.7%.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于海德格尔基础本体论的新型IT分析系统，通过区分存在者（das Seiende）与存在（das Sein），使用两种模态不同的语言处理用户输入和内部分析，并通过现象学还原模块连接两者，以揭示更深层次的本体论模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当代系统局限于范畴分析，无法处理复杂的本体论问题，如逻辑陷阱或隐喻使用。本文旨在利用海德格尔的现象学存在分析，填补这一空白。

Method: 系统采用两种语言：存在者的范畴语言处理用户输入，存在的存在语言用于内部分析，通过现象学还原模块连接两者，识别递归和自指结构。

Result: 系统能够分析用户查询，揭示本体论模式，并提供可操作的范畴化见解，优于现有工具。

Conclusion: 该系统的实现路径包括形式化存在语言，其计算完备性为通用查询分析工具奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel research analytical IT system grounded in Martin
Heidegger's Fundamental Ontology, distinguishing between beings (das Seiende)
and Being (das Sein). The system employs two modally distinct, descriptively
complete languages: a categorical language of beings for processing user inputs
and an existential language of Being for internal analysis. These languages are
bridged via a phenomenological reduction module, enabling the system to analyze
user queries (including questions, answers, and dialogues among IT
specialists), identify recursive and self-referential structures, and provide
actionable insights in categorical terms. Unlike contemporary systems limited
to categorical analysis, this approach leverages Heidegger's phenomenological
existential analysis to uncover deeper ontological patterns in query
processing, aiding in resolving logical traps in complex interactions, such as
metaphor usage in IT contexts. The path to full realization involves
formalizing the language of Being by a research team based on Heidegger's
Fundamental Ontology; given the existing completeness of the language of
beings, this reduces the system's computability to completeness, paving the way
for a universal query analysis tool. The paper presents the system's
architecture, operational principles, technical implementation, use
cases--including a case based on real IT specialist dialogues--comparative
evaluation with existing tools, and its advantages and limitations.

Result: 发现粒子运动在流体和离散化行为间转变，临界步长随维度幂律缩放，粒子可能自发解混导致密度共振。低维模型成功重现高维问题特征。

Conclusion: 通过量化非均匀性和构建低维模型，揭示了高维混合问题的机制，为调参提供了理论依据。

Abstract: In high dimensions, reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with inexact
reflections exhibits slow mixing when the particle ensemble is initialised from
a Dirac delta distribution and the uniform distribution is targeted. By
quantifying the instantaneous non-uniformity of the distribution with the
Sinkhorn divergence, we elucidate the principal mechanisms underlying the
mixing problems. In spheres and cubes, we show that the collective motion
transitions between fluid-like and discretisation-dominated behaviour, with the
critical step size scaling as a power law in the dimension. In both regimes,
the particles can spontaneously unmix, leading to resonances in the particle
density and the aforementioned problems. Additionally, low-dimensional toy
models of the dynamics are constructed which reproduce the dominant features of
the high-dimensional problem. Finally, the dynamics is contrasted with the
exact Hamiltonian particle flow and tuning practices are discussed.

Motivation: 解决大规模数据集中异常值和污染对贝叶斯推断的影响，提升变分贝叶斯方法的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Method: 将数据集划分为子集，独立计算后验分布并应用变分近似，通过Wasserstein距离的几何中位数聚合生成VM-Posterior。

Result: VM-Posterior保留了后验收缩性质，提供鲁棒性保证，并在实验中表现出良好的性能和可扩展性。

Conclusion: VM-Posterior是一种鲁棒且可扩展的变分贝叶斯方法，适用于复杂污染数据集中的贝叶斯推断。

Abstract: We propose a robust and scalable framework for variational Bayes (VB) that
effectively handles outliers and contamination of arbitrary nature in large
datasets. Our approach divides the dataset into disjoint subsets, computes the
posterior for each subset, and applies VB approximation independently to these
posteriors. The resulting variational posteriors with respect to the subsets
are then aggregated using the geometric median of probability measures,
computed with respect to the Wasserstein distance. This novel aggregation
method yields the Variational Median Posterior (VM-Posterior) distribution. We
rigorously demonstrate that the VM-Posterior preserves contraction properties
akin to those of the true posterior, while accounting for approximation errors
or the variational gap inherent in VB methods. We also provide provable
robustness guarantee of the VM-Posterior. Furthermore, we establish a
variational Bernstein-von Mises theorem for both multivariate Gaussian
distributions with general covariance structures and the mean-field variational
family. To facilitate practical implementation, we adapt existing algorithms
for computing the VM-Posterior and evaluate its performance through extensive
numerical experiments. The results highlight its robustness and scalability,
making it a reliable tool for Bayesian inference in the presence of complex,
contaminated datasets.

Conclusion: 加权谱算法改进了现有理论结果，提升了谱算法在分布偏移下的性能。

Abstract: Spectral algorithms leverage spectral regularization techniques to analyze
and process data, providing a flexible framework for addressing supervised
learning problems. To deepen our understanding of their performance in
real-world scenarios where the distributions of training and test data may
differ, we conduct a rigorous investigation into the convergence behavior of
spectral algorithms under distribution shifts, specifically within the
framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Our study focuses on the case
of covariate shift. In this scenario, the marginal distributions of the input
data differ between the training and test datasets, while the conditional
distribution of the output given the input remains unchanged. Under this
setting, we analyze the generalization error of spectral algorithms and show
that they achieve minimax optimality when the density ratios between the
training and test distributions are uniformly bounded. However, we also
identify a critical limitation: when the density ratios are unbounded, the
spectral algorithms may become suboptimal. To address this limitation, we
propose a weighted spectral algorithm that incorporates density ratio
information into the learning process. Our theoretical analysis shows that this
weighted approach achieves optimal capacity-independent convergence rates.
Furthermore, by introducing a weight clipping technique, we demonstrate that
the convergence rates of the weighted spectral algorithm can approach the
optimal capacity-dependent convergence rates arbitrarily closely. This
improvement resolves the suboptimality issue in unbounded density ratio
scenarios and advances the state-of-the-art by refining existing theoretical
results.

Motivation: 前人研究表明随机化可以通过去相关降低方差，并在低信噪比（SNR）环境下起到正则化作用。本文旨在系统分析随机化在不同SNR和数据特性下的效果。

Method: 通过常用的数据生成过程，系统分析了不同SNR下的样本外均方误差（MSE），并进行了模拟研究以考察随机化对其他数据特性的影响。

Result: 研究发现：（1）方差减少随SNR增加；（2）在低SNR下，森林优于装袋法；（3）随机化效果受数据特性影响，如厚尾分布会增加偏差，无关协变量下无效，相关协变量下有效；（4）相关协变量下，偏差显著减少。

Abstract: We study the effectiveness of randomizing split-directions in random forests.
Prior literature has shown that, on the one hand, randomization can reduce
variance through decorrelation, and, on the other hand, randomization
regularizes and works in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments. First,
we bring together and revisit decorrelation and regularization by presenting a
systematic analysis of out-of-sample mean-squared error (MSE) for different SNR
scenarios based on commonly-used data-generating processes. We find that
variance reduction tends to increase with the SNR and forests outperform
bagging when the SNR is low because, in low SNR cases, variance dominates bias
for both methods. Second, we show that the effectiveness of randomization is a
question that goes beyond the SNR. We present a simulation study with fixed and
moderate SNR, in which we examine the effectiveness of randomization for other
data characteristics. In particular, we find that (i) randomization can
increase bias in the presence of fat tails in the distribution of covariates;
(ii) in the presence of irrelevant covariates randomization is ineffective
because bias dominates variance; and (iii) when covariates are mutually
correlated randomization tends to be effective because variance dominates bias.
Beyond randomization, we find that, for both bagging and random forests, bias
can be significantly reduced in the presence of correlated covariates. This
last finding goes beyond the prevailing view that averaging mostly works by
variance reduction. Given that in practice covariates are often correlated, our
findings on correlated covariates could open the way for a better understanding
of why random forests work well in many applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨神经网络宽度对动态近似的影响，特别是在特征学习任务中。

Method: 使用投影梯度下降和均值场动态，通过微分方程分析近似差距，关注局部Hessian的作用。

Result: 证明了在自协调性质下，多项式数量的神经元足以在训练中紧密近似均值场动态。

Conclusion: 多项式宽度神经网络在特定条件下可有效近似无限宽度网络的动态行为。

Abstract: We study the approximation gap between the dynamics of a polynomial-width
neural network and its infinite-width counterpart, both trained using projected
gradient descent in the mean-field scaling regime. We demonstrate how to
tightly bound this approximation gap through a differential equation governed
by the mean-field dynamics. A key factor influencing the growth of this ODE is
the local Hessian of each particle, defined as the derivative of the particle's
velocity in the mean-field dynamics with respect to its position. We apply our
results to the canonical feature learning problem of estimating a
well-specified single-index model; we permit the information exponent to be
arbitrarily large, leading to convergence times that grow polynomially in the
ambient dimension $d$. We show that, due to a certain ``self-concordance''
property in these problems -- where the local Hessian of a particle is bounded
by a constant times the particle's velocity -- polynomially many neurons are
sufficient to closely approximate the mean-field dynamics throughout training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索XL MIMO系统作为神经网络的可能性，以简化边缘推断的复杂性并降低功耗。

Method: 将XL MIMO信道系数视为隐藏层随机节点，模拟组合器作为可训练输出层，结合ELM框架。

Result: XL-MIMO-ELM实现快速训练和高效分类，性能媲美深度学习但复杂度大幅降低。

Conclusion: XL MIMO系统可作为神经网络，为超低功耗无线设备提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that an eXtremely Large (XL) Multiple-Input
Multiple-Output (MIMO) wireless system with appropriate analog combining
components exhibits the properties of a universal function approximator,
similar to a feedforward neural network. By treating the XL MIMO channel
coefficients as the random nodes of a hidden layer, and the receiver's analog
combiner as a trainable output layer, we cast the end-to-end system to the
Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) framework, leading to a novel formulation for
Over-The-Air (OTA) edge inference without requiring traditional digital
processing nor pre-processing at the transmitter. Through theoretical analysis
and numerical evaluation, we showcase that XL-MIMO-ELM enables
near-instantaneous training and efficient classification, suggesting the
paradigm shift of beyond massive MIMO systems as neural networks alongside
their profound communications role. Compared to deep learning approaches and
conventional ELMs, the proposed framework achieves on par performance with
orders of magnitude lower complexity, making it highly attractive for ultra low
power wireless devices.

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: TransST是一种新的迁移学习框架，用于提高空间转录组数据的细胞水平异质性推断能力，显著优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组技术分辨率低且测序深度不足，难以可靠提取生物信号，因此需要一种方法利用外部标记信息改进分析。

Method: 提出TransST框架，通过迁移学习从外部数据中自适应利用细胞标记信息，推断目标数据的细胞异质性。

Result: 在真实研究和模拟实验中，TransST显著优于现有方法，成功识别了乳腺癌中的生物相关细胞簇，并区分了脂肪组织和结缔组织。

Conclusion: TransST在识别细胞亚群和检测驱动生物标志物方面既有效又稳健。

Abstract: Background: Spatial transcriptomics have emerged as a powerful tool in
biomedical research because of its ability to capture both the spatial contexts
and abundance of the complete RNA transcript profile in organs of interest.
However, limitations of the technology such as the relatively low resolution
and comparatively insufficient sequencing depth make it difficult to reliably
extract real biological signals from these data. To alleviate this challenge,
we propose a novel transfer learning framework, referred to as TransST, to
adaptively leverage the cell-labeled information from external sources in
inferring cell-level heterogeneity of a target spatial transcriptomics data.
  Results: Applications in several real studies as well as a number of
simulation settings show that our approach significantly improves existing
techniques. For example, in the breast cancer study, TransST successfully
identifies five biologically meaningful cell clusters, including the two
subgroups of cancer in situ and invasive cancer; in addition, only TransST is
able to separate the adipose tissues from the connective issues among all the
studied methods.
  Conclusions: In summary, the proposed method TransST is both effective and
robust in identifying cell subclusters and detecting corresponding driving
biomarkers in spatial transcriptomics data.

TL;DR: WaterFlow (WF) 是一种基于学习潜在依赖水印的快速、高保真视觉水印方法，解决了现有技术在计算速度、鲁棒性和感知质量上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的水印技术在计算速度和鲁棒性之间存在权衡，无法同时满足快速部署和高质量需求，尤其是在生成图像快速增长的背景下。

Method: 利用预训练的潜在扩散模型将图像编码到潜在空间，并通过可逆流层在傅里叶域中嵌入水印，增强鲁棒性和图像质量。

Result: WaterFlow 在鲁棒性上表现优异，首次有效抵御复杂组合攻击，并在 MS-COCO、DiffusionDB 和 WikiArt 数据集上验证了其性能。

Conclusion: WaterFlow 是一种高效、鲁棒的水印方法，适用于快速部署和高保真需求的应用场景。

Abstract: The ability to embed watermarks in images is a fundamental problem of
interest for computer vision, and is exacerbated by the rapid rise of generated
imagery in recent times. Current state-of-the-art techniques suffer from
computational and statistical challenges such as the slow execution speed for
practical deployments. In addition, other works trade off fast watermarking
speeds but suffer greatly in their robustness or perceptual quality. In this
work, we propose WaterFlow (WF), a fast and extremely robust approach for high
fidelity visual watermarking based on a learned latent-dependent watermark. Our
approach utilizes a pretrained latent diffusion model to encode an arbitrary
image into a latent space and produces a learned watermark that is then planted
into the Fourier Domain of the latent. The transformation is specified via
invertible flow layers that enhance the expressivity of the latent space of the
pre-trained model to better preserve image quality while permitting robust and
tractable detection. Most notably, WaterFlow demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance on general robustness and is the first method capable of
effectively defending against difficult combination attacks. We validate our
findings on three widely used real and generated datasets: MS-COCO,
DiffusionDB, and WikiArt.

Motivation: 当前AI方法在组织病理学中面临标注成本高、计算需求大和缺乏不确定性估计等问题，限制了其实际应用。

Method: TUMLS采用自编码器作为特征提取器，从低分辨率数据中识别组织类型，并基于不确定性选择代表性区域进行无监督核分割。

Result: 在UPENN-GBM数据集上，自编码器的MSE为0.0016；在MoNuSeg数据集上，核分割的F1分数为77.46%，Jaccard分数为63.35%，优于其他无监督方法。

Conclusion: TUMLS显著提升了数字病理学的工作流程效率和透明度，展示了其在领域中的有效性。

Abstract: Digital pathology, augmented by artificial intelligence (AI), holds
significant promise for improving the workflow of pathologists. However,
challenges such as the labor-intensive annotation of whole slide images (WSIs),
high computational demands, and trust concerns arising from the absence of
uncertainty estimation in predictions hinder the practical application of
current AI methodologies in histopathology. To address these issues, we present
a novel trustful fully unsupervised multi-level segmentation methodology
(TUMLS) for WSIs. TUMLS adopts an autoencoder (AE) as a feature extractor to
identify the different tissue types within low-resolution training data. It
selects representative patches from each identified group based on an
uncertainty measure and then does unsupervised nuclei segmentation in their
respective higher-resolution space without using any ML algorithms. Crucially,
this solution integrates seamlessly into clinicians workflows, transforming the
examination of a whole WSI into a review of concise, interpretable cross-level
insights. This integration significantly enhances and accelerates the workflow
while ensuring transparency. We evaluated our approach using the UPENN-GBM
dataset, where the AE achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0016.
Additionally, nucleus segmentation is assessed on the MoNuSeg dataset,
outperforming all unsupervised approaches with an F1 score of 77.46% and a
Jaccard score of 63.35%. These results demonstrate the efficacy of TUMLS in
advancing the field of digital pathology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视图3D重建在计算机视觉中仍具挑战性，现有方法（如DUSt3R）在多视图场景中存在高计算成本和累积误差问题。

Method: Regist3R采用增量式重建范式，适用于无序多视图图像集的大规模3D重建。

Conclusion: Regist3R在真实场景（如倾斜航空数据集）中表现优异，展示了其在大规模3D重建任务（如城市建模和航空测绘）中的潜力。

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction has remained an essential yet challenging
problem in the field of computer vision. While DUSt3R and its successors have
achieved breakthroughs in 3D reconstruction from unposed images, these methods
exhibit significant limitations when scaling to multi-view scenarios, including
high computational cost and cumulative error induced by global alignment. To
address these challenges, we propose Regist3R, a novel stereo foundation model
tailored for efficient and scalable incremental reconstruction. Regist3R
leverages an incremental reconstruction paradigm, enabling large-scale 3D
reconstructions from unordered and many-view image collections. We evaluate
Regist3R on public datasets for camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction.
Our experiments demonstrate that Regist3R achieves comparable performance with
optimization-based methods while significantly improving computational
efficiency, and outperforms existing multi-view reconstruction models.
Furthermore, to assess its performance in real-world applications, we introduce
a challenging oblique aerial dataset which has long spatial spans and hundreds
of views. The results highlight the effectiveness of Regist3R. We also
demonstrate the first attempt to reconstruct large-scale scenes encompassing
over thousands of views through pointmap-based foundation models, showcasing
its potential for practical applications in large-scale 3D reconstruction
tasks, including urban modeling, aerial mapping, and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏磁共振成像（CMR）虽为心脏评估的金标准，但未涵盖患者个体健康因素，限制了全面评估。ViTa旨在填补这一空白。

Method: ViTa整合了42,000名UK Biobank参与者的3D+T心脏成像数据和患者个体因素，通过多模态学习共享潜在表征。

Result: ViTa支持多种下游任务，如心脏表型预测、分割和疾病分类，提供了更全面的心脏健康评估。

Conclusion: ViTa通过多模态整合，实现了对心脏健康的通用、个体化理解，具有临床实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard for non-invasive
cardiac assessment, offering rich spatio-temporal views of the cardiac anatomy
and physiology. Patient-level health factors, such as demographics, metabolic,
and lifestyle, are known to substantially influence cardiovascular health and
disease risk, yet remain uncaptured by CMR alone. To holistically understand
cardiac health and to enable the best possible interpretation of an
individual's disease risk, CMR and patient-level factors must be jointly
exploited within an integrated framework. Recent multi-modal approaches have
begun to bridge this gap, yet they often rely on limited spatio-temporal data
and focus on isolated clinical tasks, thereby hindering the development of a
comprehensive representation for cardiac health evaluation. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce ViTa, a step toward foundation models that delivers a
comprehensive representation of the heart and a precise interpretation of
individual disease risk. Leveraging data from 42,000 UK Biobank participants,
ViTa integrates 3D+T cine stacks from short-axis and long-axis views, enabling
a complete capture of the cardiac cycle. These imaging data are then fused with
detailed tabular patient-level factors, enabling context-aware insights. This
multi-modal paradigm supports a wide spectrum of downstream tasks, including
cardiac phenotype and physiological feature prediction, segmentation, and
classification of cardiac and metabolic diseases within a single unified
framework. By learning a shared latent representation that bridges rich imaging
features and patient context, ViTa moves beyond traditional, task-specific
models toward a universal, patient-specific understanding of cardiac health,
highlighting its potential to advance clinical utility and scalability in
cardiac analysis.

Abstract: Foundation models in digital pathology use massive datasets to learn useful
compact feature representations of complex histology images. However, there is
limited transparency into what drives the correlation between dataset size and
performance, raising the question of whether simply adding more data to
increase performance is always necessary. In this study, we propose a
prototype-guided diffusion model to generate high-fidelity synthetic pathology
data at scale, enabling large-scale self-supervised learning and reducing
reliance on real patient samples while preserving downstream performance. Using
guidance from histological prototypes during sampling, our approach ensures
biologically and diagnostically meaningful variations in the generated data. We
demonstrate that self-supervised features trained on our synthetic dataset
achieve competitive performance despite using ~60x-760x less data than models
trained on large real-world datasets. Notably, models trained using our
synthetic data showed statistically comparable or better performance across
multiple evaluation metrics and tasks, even when compared to models trained on
orders of magnitude larger datasets. Our hybrid approach, combining synthetic
and real data, further enhanced performance, achieving top results in several
evaluations. These findings underscore the potential of generative AI to create
compelling training data for digital pathology, significantly reducing the
reliance on extensive clinical datasets and highlighting the efficiency of our
approach.

Result: UniPhys在运动自然性、泛化性和鲁棒性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UniPhys能生成高质量的长时程运动，无需任务特定微调，适用于多样化控制任务。

Abstract: Generating natural and physically plausible character motion remains
challenging, particularly for long-horizon control with diverse guidance
signals. While prior work combines high-level diffusion-based motion planners
with low-level physics controllers, these systems suffer from domain gaps that
degrade motion quality and require task-specific fine-tuning. To tackle this
problem, we introduce UniPhys, a diffusion-based behavior cloning framework
that unifies motion planning and control into a single model. UniPhys enables
flexible, expressive character motion conditioned on multi-modal inputs such as
text, trajectories, and goals. To address accumulated prediction errors over
long sequences, UniPhys is trained with the Diffusion Forcing paradigm,
learning to denoise noisy motion histories and handle discrepancies introduced
by the physics simulator. This design allows UniPhys to robustly generate
physically plausible, long-horizon motions. Through guided sampling, UniPhys
generalizes to a wide range of control signals, including unseen ones, without
requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Experiments show that UniPhys outperforms
prior methods in motion naturalness, generalization, and robustness across
diverse control tasks.

Conclusion: 3D-PNAS为工业质量检测提供了有效的3D异常生成工具，并提供了代码库和可视化工具包以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Large pretrained vision foundation models have shown significant potential in
various vision tasks. However, for industrial anomaly detection, the scarcity
of real defect samples poses a critical challenge in leveraging these models.
While 2D anomaly generation has significantly advanced with established
generative models, the adoption of 3D sensors in industrial manufacturing has
made leveraging 3D data for surface quality inspection an emerging trend. In
contrast to 2D techniques, 3D anomaly generation remains largely unexplored,
limiting the potential of 3D data in industrial quality inspection. To address
this gap, we propose a novel yet simple 3D anomaly generation method, 3D-PNAS,
based on Perlin noise and surface parameterization. Our method generates
realistic 3D surface anomalies by projecting the point cloud onto a 2D plane,
sampling multi-scale noise values from a Perlin noise field, and perturbing the
point cloud along its normal direction. Through comprehensive visualization
experiments, we demonstrate how key parameters - including noise scale,
perturbation strength, and octaves, provide fine-grained control over the
generated anomalies, enabling the creation of diverse defect patterns from
pronounced deformations to subtle surface variations. Additionally, our
cross-category experiments show that the method produces consistent yet
geometrically plausible anomalies across different object types, adapting to
their specific surface characteristics. We also provide a comprehensive
codebase and visualization toolkit to facilitate future research.

Conclusion: ARAP-GS为拖拽驱动3DGS编辑提供了有效且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Drag-driven editing has become popular among designers for its ability to
modify complex geometric structures through simple and intuitive manipulation,
allowing users to adjust and reshape content with minimal technical skill. This
drag operation has been incorporated into numerous methods to facilitate the
editing of 2D images and 3D meshes in design. However, few studies have
explored drag-driven editing for the widely-used 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
representation, as deforming 3DGS while preserving shape coherence and visual
continuity remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce ARAP-GS, a
drag-driven 3DGS editing framework based on As-Rigid-As-Possible (ARAP)
deformation. Unlike previous 3DGS editing methods, we are the first to apply
ARAP deformation directly to 3D Gaussians, enabling flexible, drag-driven
geometric transformations. To preserve scene appearance after deformation, we
incorporate an advanced diffusion prior for image super-resolution within our
iterative optimization process. This approach enhances visual quality while
maintaining multi-view consistency in the edited results. Experiments show that
ARAP-GS outperforms current methods across diverse 3D scenes, demonstrating its
effectiveness and superiority for drag-driven 3DGS editing. Additionally, our
method is highly efficient, requiring only 10 to 20 minutes to edit a scene on
a single RTX 3090 GPU.

Motivation: 3D高斯溅射（3DGS）作为真实场景的3D表示，用户友好的变形需求日益增长，但保留细节和纹理保真度仍是挑战。

Conclusion: CAGE-GS是一种灵活且高效的方法，适用于多种目标形状表示，提升了3DGS变形的质量。

Abstract: As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) gains popularity as a 3D representation of
real scenes, enabling user-friendly deformation to create novel scenes while
preserving fine details from the original 3DGS has attracted significant
research attention. We introduce CAGE-GS, a cage-based 3DGS deformation method
that seamlessly aligns a source 3DGS scene with a user-defined target shape.
Our approach learns a deformation cage from the target, which guides the
geometric transformation of the source scene. While the cages effectively
control structural alignment, preserving the textural appearance of 3DGS
remains challenging due to the complexity of covariance parameters. To address
this, we employ a Jacobian matrix-based strategy to update the covariance
parameters of each Gaussian, ensuring texture fidelity post-deformation. Our
method is highly flexible, accommodating various target shape representations,
including texts, images, point clouds, meshes and 3DGS models. Extensive
experiments and ablation studies on both public datasets and newly proposed
scenes demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
techniques in both efficiency and deformation quality.

TL;DR: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）在3D重建中表现优异，但仍存在走样、投影伪影和视角不一致问题。通过引入全3D高斯评估、自适应3D平滑滤波器和稳定的视空间边界方法，本文解决了这些问题，并提升了渲染效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS在简化处理时将泼溅视为2D实体，导致走样、伪影和视角不一致。本文旨在通过全3D评估解决这些问题。

Method: 引入自适应3D平滑滤波器减少走样，提出稳定的视空间边界方法消除弹出伪影，并推广基于瓦片的3D剔除技术。

Result: 在分布内评估集上达到最优质量，在分布外视角下显著优于其他方法，有效消除了走样、失真和弹出伪影。

Conclusion: 通过全3D高斯评估和优化技术，实现了实时、无伪影的高质量渲染。

Abstract: Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized 3D reconstruction,
it still faces challenges such as aliasing, projection artifacts, and view
inconsistencies, primarily due to the simplification of treating splats as 2D
entities. We argue that incorporating full 3D evaluation of Gaussians
throughout the 3DGS pipeline can effectively address these issues while
preserving rasterization efficiency. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive 3D
smoothing filter to mitigate aliasing and present a stable view-space bounding
method that eliminates popping artifacts when Gaussians extend beyond the view
frustum. Furthermore, we promote tile-based culling to 3D with screen-space
planes, accelerating rendering and reducing sorting costs for hierarchical
rasterization. Our method achieves state-of-the-art quality on in-distribution
evaluation sets and significantly outperforms other approaches for
out-of-distribution views. Our qualitative evaluations further demonstrate the
effective removal of aliasing, distortions, and popping artifacts, ensuring
real-time, artifact-free rendering.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么难以用单一MLP捕捉姿态依赖的细节，要么依赖计算密集型网络导致渲染性能下降。

Method: 通过空间分布的MLP和基于距离的插值获取高斯参数，结合高斯偏移基和线性组合，实现高保真外观和实时渲染。

Result: 相比现有方法，实现了更高的外观质量和更快的渲染速度。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持实时渲染的同时，显著提升了外观细节的保真度。

Abstract: Many works have succeeded in reconstructing Gaussian human avatars from
multi-view videos. However, they either struggle to capture pose-dependent
appearance details with a single MLP, or rely on a computationally intensive
neural network to reconstruct high-fidelity appearance but with rendering
performance degraded to non-real-time. We propose a novel Gaussian human avatar
representation that can reconstruct high-fidelity pose-dependence appearance
with details and meanwhile can be rendered in real time. Our Gaussian avatar is
empowered by spatially distributed MLPs which are explicitly located on
different positions on human body. The parameters stored in each Gaussian are
obtained by interpolating from the outputs of its nearby MLPs based on their
distances. To avoid undesired smooth Gaussian property changing during
interpolation, for each Gaussian we define a set of Gaussian offset basis, and
a linear combination of basis represents the Gaussian property offsets relative
to the neutral properties. Then we propose to let the MLPs output a set of
coefficients corresponding to the basis. In this way, although Gaussian
coefficients are derived from interpolation and change smoothly, the Gaussian
offset basis is learned freely without constraints. The smoothly varying
coefficients combined with freely learned basis can still produce distinctly
different Gaussian property offsets, allowing the ability to learn
high-frequency spatial signals. We further use control points to constrain the
Gaussians distributed on a surface layer rather than allowing them to be
irregularly distributed inside the body, to help the human avatar generalize
better when animated under novel poses. Compared to the state-of-the-art
method, our method achieves better appearance quality with finer details while
the rendering speed is significantly faster under novel views and novel poses.

Result: 实验验证了预处理管道的有效性，展示了高斯化身在Unity中的多功能性。

Conclusion: 该方法具有可扩展性和实用性，适用于VR/AR应用开发。

Abstract: Photorealistic avatars have become essential for immersive applications in
virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), enabling lifelike interactions
in areas such as training simulations, telemedicine, and virtual collaboration.
These avatars bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds, improving
the user experience through realistic human representation. However, existing
avatar creation techniques face significant challenges, including high costs,
long creation times, and limited utility in virtual applications. Manual
methods, such as MetaHuman, require extensive time and expertise, while
automatic approaches, such as NeRF-based pipelines often lack efficiency,
detailed facial expression fidelity, and are unable to be rendered at a speed
sufficent for real-time applications. By involving several cutting-edge modern
techniques, we introduce an end-to-end 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) avatar
creation pipeline that leverages monocular video input to create a scalable and
efficient photorealistic avatar directly compatible with the Unity game engine.
Our pipeline incorporates a novel Gaussian splatting technique with customized
preprocessing that enables the user of "in the wild" monocular video capture,
detailed facial expression reconstruction and embedding within a fully rigged
avatar model. Additionally, we present a Unity-integrated Gaussian Splatting
Avatar Editor, offering a user-friendly environment for VR/AR application
development. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our
preprocessing pipeline in standardizing custom data for 3DGS training and
demonstrate the versatility of Gaussian avatars in Unity, highlighting the
scalability and practicality of our approach.

TL;DR: CompGS++是一种新型框架，通过紧凑的高斯基元减少3D场景建模的数据量，显著提升压缩性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯溅射在3D场景建模中表现优异，但数据量大且存在基元冗余，需压缩以适应未来沉浸式视觉通信应用。

Method: 提出CompGS++框架，通过空间和时间基元预测模块消除冗余，并采用率约束优化模块减少参数冗余。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，CompGS++显著优于现有方法，实现高效压缩并保持精确建模。

Conclusion: CompGS++为3D场景建模提供了一种高效压缩方案，未来将在GitHub开源以促进研究。

Abstract: Gaussian splatting demonstrates proficiency for 3D scene modeling but suffers
from substantial data volume due to inherent primitive redundancy. To enable
future photorealistic 3D immersive visual communication applications,
significant compression is essential for transmission over the existing
Internet infrastructure. Hence, we propose Compressed Gaussian Splatting
(CompGS++), a novel framework that leverages compact Gaussian primitives to
achieve accurate 3D modeling with substantial size reduction for both static
and dynamic scenes. Our design is based on the principle of eliminating
redundancy both between and within primitives. Specifically, we develop a
comprehensive prediction paradigm to address inter-primitive redundancy through
spatial and temporal primitive prediction modules. The spatial primitive
prediction module establishes predictive relationships for scene primitives and
enables most primitives to be encoded as compact residuals, substantially
reducing the spatial redundancy. We further devise a temporal primitive
prediction module to handle dynamic scenes, which exploits primitive
correlations across timestamps to effectively reduce temporal redundancy.
Moreover, we devise a rate-constrained optimization module that jointly
minimizes reconstruction error and rate consumption. This module effectively
eliminates parameter redundancy within primitives and enhances the overall
compactness of scene representations. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that CompGS++ significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving superior compression performance while preserving accurate
scene modeling. Our implementation will be made publicly available on GitHub to
facilitate further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D场景生成中类别有限或缺乏编辑灵活性，HiScene旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用分层方法将场景视为等距视图下的复杂对象，开发视频扩散技术处理遮挡，并引入形状先验注入保证空间一致性。

Result: 实验表明，HiScene能生成更自然的对象布局和完整实例，适合交互应用，同时保持物理合理性和用户输入对齐。

Conclusion: HiScene通过分层框架和新技术，成功提升了3D场景生成的保真度和编辑灵活性。

Abstract: Scene-level 3D generation represents a critical frontier in multimedia and
computer graphics, yet existing approaches either suffer from limited object
categories or lack editing flexibility for interactive applications. In this
paper, we present HiScene, a novel hierarchical framework that bridges the gap
between 2D image generation and 3D object generation and delivers high-fidelity
scenes with compositional identities and aesthetic scene content. Our key
insight is treating scenes as hierarchical "objects" under isometric views,
where a room functions as a complex object that can be further decomposed into
manipulatable items. This hierarchical approach enables us to generate 3D
content that aligns with 2D representations while maintaining compositional
structure. To ensure completeness and spatial alignment of each decomposed
instance, we develop a video-diffusion-based amodal completion technique that
effectively handles occlusions and shadows between objects, and introduce shape
prior injection to ensure spatial coherence within the scene. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method produces more natural object arrangements
and complete object instances suitable for interactive applications, while
maintaining physical plausibility and alignment with user inputs.

Result: 相比通用方法，该系统在性能和效率上表现更优。

Conclusion: 该系统为银行领域特定文本处理提供了有效解决方案，展示了语言特定技术和领域知识的重要性。

Abstract: With the introduction of the PSD2 regulation in the EU which established the
Open Banking framework, a new window of opportunities has opened for banks and
fintechs to explore and enrich Bank transaction descriptions with the aim of
building a better understanding of customer behavior, while using this
understanding to prevent fraud, reduce risks and offer more competitive and
tailored services.
  And although the usage of natural language processing models and techniques
has seen an incredible progress in various applications and domains over the
past few years, custom applications based on domain-specific text corpus remain
unaddressed especially in the banking sector.
  In this paper, we introduce a language-based Open Banking transaction
classification system with a focus on the french market and french language
text. The system encompasses data collection, labeling, preprocessing,
modeling, and evaluation stages. Unlike previous studies that focus on general
classification approaches, this system is specifically tailored to address the
challenges posed by training a language model with a specialized text corpus
(Banking data in the French context). By incorporating language-specific
techniques and domain knowledge, the proposed system demonstrates enhanced
performance and efficiency compared to generic approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在自动化相关性判断中的稳健性，特别是提示变化对结果的影响。

Method: 收集了人类专家和LLMs生成的提示，使用不同LLMs作为评估工具，比较其与TREC官方人类标签的一致性。

Result: 发现提示变化对LLMs与人类标签的一致性有显著影响，并比较了不同LLMs的表现。

Conclusion: LLMs在相关性评估中表现接近人类，但提示设计对结果至关重要，数据已公开供未来研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate relevance
judgments for information retrieval (IR) tasks, often demonstrating agreement
with human labels that approaches inter-human agreement. To assess the
robustness and reliability of LLM-based relevance judgments, we systematically
investigate impact of prompt sensitivity on the task. We collected prompts for
relevance assessment from 15 human experts and 15 LLMs across three tasks~ --
~binary, graded, and pairwise~ -- ~yielding 90 prompts in total. After
filtering out unusable prompts from three humans and three LLMs, we employed
the remaining 72 prompts with three different LLMs as judges to label
document/query pairs from two TREC Deep Learning Datasets (2020 and 2021). We
compare LLM-generated labels with TREC official human labels using Cohen's
$\kappa$ and pairwise agreement measures. In addition to investigating the
impact of prompt variations on agreement with human labels, we compare human-
and LLM-generated prompts and analyze differences among different LLMs as
judges. We also compare human- and LLM-generated prompts with the standard
UMBRELA prompt used for relevance assessment by Bing and TREC 2024 Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) Track. To support future research in LLM-based
evaluation, we release all data and prompts at

Motivation: 由于真实用户数据的稀缺和隐私问题，需要一种可信且成本效益高的方法来模拟用户行为。

Method: SimUSER通过从历史数据中识别自洽的用户角色，并配备人物、记忆、感知和大脑模块，模拟用户与推荐系统的交互。

Result: SimUSER在微观和宏观层面均比先前工作更接近真实用户行为，并通过实验探索了缩略图、曝光效应和评论对用户参与度的影响。

Conclusion: 基于离线A/B测试结果优化推荐系统参数，SimUSER显著提升了真实世界中的用户参与度。

Abstract: Recommender systems play a central role in numerous real-life applications,
yet evaluating their performance remains a significant challenge due to the gap
between offline metrics and online behaviors. Given the scarcity and limits
(e.g., privacy issues) of real user data, we introduce SimUSER, an agent
framework that serves as believable and cost-effective human proxies. SimUSER
first identifies self-consistent personas from historical data, enriching user
profiles with unique backgrounds and personalities. Then, central to this
evaluation are users equipped with persona, memory, perception, and brain
modules, engaging in interactions with the recommender system. SimUSER exhibits
closer alignment with genuine humans than prior work, both at micro and macro
levels. Additionally, we conduct insightful experiments to explore the effects
of thumbnails on click rates, the exposure effect, and the impact of reviews on
user engagement. Finally, we refine recommender system parameters based on
offline A/B test results, resulting in improved user engagement in the real
world.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in both academic and
industry settings to automate the evaluation of information seeking systems,
particularly by generating graded relevance judgments. Previous work on
LLM-based relevance assessment has primarily focused on replicating graded
human relevance judgments through various prompting strategies. However, there
has been limited exploration of alternative assessment methods or comprehensive
comparative studies. In this paper, we systematically compare multiple
LLM-based relevance assessment methods, including binary relevance judgments,
graded relevance assessments, pairwise preference-based methods, and two
nugget-based evaluation methods~--~document-agnostic and document-dependent. In
addition to a traditional comparison based on system rankings using Kendall
correlations, we also examine how well LLM judgments align with human
preferences, as inferred from relevance grades. We conduct extensive
experiments on datasets from three TREC Deep Learning tracks 2019, 2020 and
2021 as well as the ANTIQUE dataset, which focuses on non-factoid open-domain
question answering. As part of our data release, we include relevance judgments
generated by both an open-source (Llama3.2b) and a commercial (gpt-4o) model.
Our goal is to \textit{reproduce} various LLM-based relevance judgment methods
to provide a comprehensive comparison. All code, data, and resources are

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于正则化损失和剪枝策略的方法，以减少ColBERT模型的内存需求，同时保持检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ColBERT等神经IR模型需要大量内存存储文档标记的上下文表示，现有剪枝方法无法保证不影响检索分数。

Method: 引入三种正则化损失和两种剪枝策略，以高剪枝率去除不影响查询-文档分数的标记。

Result: 实验表明，仅使用30%的标记即可保持ColBERT的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持检索效果的同时显著减少了内存需求。

Abstract: Late interaction neural IR models like ColBERT offer a competitive
effectiveness-efficiency trade-off across many benchmarks. However, they
require a huge memory space to store the contextual representation for all the
document tokens. Some works have proposed using either heuristics or
statistical-based techniques to prune tokens from each document. This however
doesn't guarantee that the removed tokens have no impact on the retrieval
score. Our work uses a principled approach to define how to prune tokens
without impacting the score between a document and a query. We introduce three
regularization losses, that induce a solution with high pruning ratios, as well
as two pruning strategies. We study them experimentally (in and out-domain),
showing that we can preserve ColBERT's performance while using only 30\% of the
tokens.

Conclusion: FreshStack为构建高质量的IR评估基准提供了工具，并揭示了现有技术的改进空间。

Abstract: We introduce FreshStack, a reusable framework for automatically building
information retrieval (IR) evaluation benchmarks from community-asked questions
and answers. FreshStack conducts the following steps: (1) automatic corpus
collection from code and technical documentation, (2) nugget generation from
community-asked questions and answers, and (3) nugget-level support, retrieving
documents using a fusion of retrieval techniques and hybrid architectures. We
use FreshStack to build five datasets on fast-growing, recent, and niche topics
to ensure the tasks are sufficiently challenging. On FreshStack, existing
retrieval models, when applied out-of-the-box, significantly underperform
oracle approaches on all five topics, denoting plenty of headroom to improve IR
quality. In addition, we identify cases where rerankers do not clearly improve
first-stage retrieval accuracy (two out of five topics). We hope that
FreshStack will facilitate future work toward constructing realistic, scalable,

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的生成式跨模态检索框架SemCORE，通过结构化自然语言标识符和生成语义验证策略，显著提升了检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跨模态检索方法依赖嵌入相似性计算，而生成式检索虽具潜力，但在语义信息利用上不足。

Method: 构建结构化自然语言标识符（SID）并引入生成语义验证（GSV）策略，同时支持文本到图像和图像到文本检索。

Result: 在基准数据集上，SemCORE在文本到图像检索任务中Recall@1平均提升8.65分。

Conclusion: SemCORE框架通过增强语义理解能力，显著优于现有生成式跨模态检索方法。

Abstract: Cross-modal retrieval (CMR) is a fundamental task in multimedia research,
focused on retrieving semantically relevant targets across different
modalities. While traditional CMR methods match text and image via
embedding-based similarity calculations, recent advancements in pre-trained
generative models have established generative retrieval as a promising
alternative. This paradigm assigns each target a unique identifier and
leverages a generative model to directly predict identifiers corresponding to
input queries without explicit indexing. Despite its great potential, current
generative CMR approaches still face semantic information insufficiency in both
identifier construction and generation processes. To address these limitations,
we propose a novel unified Semantic-enhanced generative Cross-mOdal REtrieval
framework (SemCORE), designed to unleash the semantic understanding
capabilities in generative cross-modal retrieval task. Specifically, we first
construct a Structured natural language IDentifier (SID) that effectively
aligns target identifiers with generative models optimized for natural language
comprehension and generation. Furthermore, we introduce a Generative Semantic
Verification (GSV) strategy enabling fine-grained target discrimination.
Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, SemCORE is the first framework to
simultaneously consider both text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval tasks
within generative cross-modal retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our framework outperforms state-of-the-art generative cross-modal retrieval
methods. Notably, SemCORE achieves substantial improvements across benchmark
datasets, with an average increase of 8.65 points in Recall@1 for text-to-image
retrieval.
