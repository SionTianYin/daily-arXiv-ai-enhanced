### [1] [DrDiff: Dynamic Routing Diffusion with Hierarchical Attention for Breaking the Efficiency-Quality Trade-off](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02785)
*Jusheng Zhang,Yijia Fan,Kaitong Cai,Zimeng Huang,Xiaofei Sun,Jian Wang,Chengpei Tang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DrDiff是一个新颖的长文本生成框架，通过动态专家调度、分层稀疏注意力和软吸收引导优化三项核心技术，解决了效率与质量的权衡问题，在多个基准测试中优于现有SOTA方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长文本生成中效率与质量之间的权衡问题，传统方法在处理不同难度和长度的文本时计算效率低下。

Method: 1. 动态专家调度机制：根据文本复杂度智能分配计算资源；2. 分层稀疏注意力机制：自适应调整注意力模式，将计算复杂度从O(n²)降至O(n)；3. 软吸收引导优化策略：结合DPM-solver++减少扩散步骤。

Result: 在多个长文本生成基准测试中，DrDiff展现出优于现有最先进方法的性能，显著提高了生成效率和质量。

Conclusion: DrDiff通过三项创新技术成功解决了长文本生成的效率-质量权衡问题，为高效高质量的长文本生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces DrDiff, a novel framework for long-text generation that
overcomes the efficiency-quality trade-off through three core technologies.
First, we design a dynamic expert scheduling mechanism that intelligently
allocates computational resources during the diffusion process based on text
complexity, enabling more efficient handling of text generation tasks of
varying difficulty. Second, we introduce a Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HSA)
mechanism that adaptively adjusts attention patterns according to a variety of
input lengths, reducing computational complexity from O($n^2$) to O($n$) while
maintaining model performance. Finally, we propose a soft absorption guidance
optimization strategy that combines with DPM-solver++ to reduce diffusion
steps, significantly improving generation speed. Comprehensive experiments on
various long-text generation benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our
DrDiff over the existing SOTA methods.

### [2] [SSVD: Structured SVD for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning and Benchmarking under Domain Shift in ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02830)
*Pu Wang,Shinji Watanabe,Hugo Van hamme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文对语音识别任务进行了参数高效微调(PEFT)方法的综合性基准测诅，并提出了结构化SVD导向(SSVD)微调方法，在保持语义映射的同时实现了高效的域适配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然低秩适配(LoRA)在语音应用中广泛使用，但当前最先进的PEFT方法(如VeRA、DoRA、PiSSA、SVFT)主要为语言和视觉任务而开发，在语音领域缺乏充分验证。

Method: 在ESPnet中集成并基准测诅多种PEFT方法，并提出结构化SVD导向(SSVD)微调方法，通过选择性旋转输入相关的右奇异向量而保持输出相关向量固定来保留语义映射。

Result: 在域转移语音识别任务(包括儿童语音和方言变体)上进行评估，模型规模从0.1B到2B。SSVD方法能够以最小的可训练参数实现健壮的域适配和提升的效率。

Conclusion: 该研究为语音领域提供了PEFT方法的综合性基准测诅，SSVD方法显示出在保持语义一致性的同时实现高效域适配的潜力。所有实现已在ESPnet中开源以支持可复现性和未来研究。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a scalable solution for
adapting large foundation models. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is widely
used in speech applications, its state-of-the-art variants, e.g., VeRA, DoRA,
PiSSA, and SVFT, are developed mainly for language and vision tasks, with
limited validation in speech. This work presents the first comprehensive
integration and benchmarking of these PEFT methods within ESPnet. We further
introduce structured SVD-guided (SSVD) fine-tuning, which selectively rotates
input-associated right singular vectors while keeping output-associated vectors
fixed to preserve semantic mappings. This design enables robust domain
adaptation with minimal trainable parameters and improved efficiency. We
evaluate all methods on domain-shifted speech recognition tasks, including
child speech and dialectal variation, across model scales from 0.1B to 2B. All
implementations are released in ESPnet to support reproducibility and future
work.

### [3] [Clustering Discourses: Racial Biases in Short Stories about Women Generated by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02834)
*Gustavo Bonil,João Gondim,Marina dos Santos,Simone Hashiguti,Helena Maia,Nadia Silva,Helio Pedrini,Sandra Avila*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究分析LLaMA 3.2-3B生成葡萄牙语短篇小说中对黑人和白人女性的叙事构建，发现存在三种主要话语表征，揭示了看似中立的文本实则强化殖民结构下的性别不平等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型在生成文本中如何构建关于不同种族女性的叙事，以及这些叙事是否延续了历史上的不平等结构。

Method: 从2100个生成文本中应用计算方法进行语义分组，结合机器学习技术和人工话语分析的集成方法进行定性分析。

Result: 识别出三种主要话语表征：社会超越、祖先神话化和主观自我实现，发现语法连贯的文本实际上体现了固化的殖民结构框架。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了AI生成文本中隐含的殖民主义性别框架，提出了结合计算和定性分析的方法来识别和应对这种结构性偏见。

Abstract: This study investigates how large language models, in particular LLaMA
3.2-3B, construct narratives about Black and white women in short stories
generated in Portuguese. From 2100 texts, we applied computational methods to
group semantically similar stories, allowing a selection for qualitative
analysis. Three main discursive representations emerge: social overcoming,
ancestral mythification and subjective self-realization. The analysis uncovers
how grammatically coherent, seemingly neutral texts materialize a crystallized,
colonially structured framing of the female body, reinforcing historical
inequalities. The study proposes an integrated approach, that combines machine
learning techniques with qualitative, manual discourse analysis.

### [4] [IDEAlign: Comparing Large Language Models to Human Experts in Open-ended Interpretive Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02855)
*Hyunji Nam,Lucia Langlois,James Malamut,Mei Tan,Dorottya Demszky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了IDEAlgin框架，通过"三选一"任务评估LLM生成解释性标注与专家标注的相似性，发现基于向量的方法效果不佳，而LLM作为评判者能显著提升与专家判断的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM越来越多地应用于开放式解释性标注任务，但缺乏可扩展的方法来评估LLM生成标注与专家标注的相似性，这阻碍了LLM在教育等领域的负责任部署。

Method: 提出IDEAlgin基准框架，使用"三选一"三元组判断任务收集专家相似性评分，并评估各种相似性度量方法（基于向量的方法和LLM作为评判者）与人类基准的一致性。

Result: 基于向量的度量方法在捕捉专家关注的细微相似性维度方面表现不佳。通过IDEAlgin提示LLM显著改善了与专家判断的一致性（提升9-30%），优于传统的词汇和基于向量的方法。

Conclusion: IDEAlgin为大规模评估LLM在开放式专家标注任务中的表现提供了有前景的范式，有助于LLM在教育等领域的负责任部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to open-ended,
interpretive annotation tasks, such as thematic analysis by researchers or
generating feedback on student work by teachers. These tasks involve free-text
annotations requiring expert-level judgments grounded in specific objectives
(e.g., research questions or instructional goals). Evaluating whether
LLM-generated annotations align with those generated by expert humans is
challenging to do at scale, and currently, no validated, scalable measure of
similarity in ideas exists. In this paper, we (i) introduce the scalable
evaluation of interpretive annotation by LLMs as a critical and understudied
task, (ii) propose IDEAlgin, an intuitive benchmarking paradigm for capturing
expert similarity ratings via a "pick-the-odd-one-out" triplet judgment task,
and (iii) evaluate various similarity metrics, including vector-based ones
(topic models, embeddings) and LLM-as-a-judge via IDEAlgin, against these human
benchmarks. Applying this approach to two real-world educational datasets
(interpretive analysis and feedback generation), we find that vector-based
metrics largely fail to capture the nuanced dimensions of similarity meaningful
to experts. Prompting LLMs via IDEAlgin significantly improves alignment with
expert judgments (9-30% increase) compared to traditional lexical and
vector-based metrics. These results establish IDEAlgin as a promising paradigm
for evaluating LLMs against open-ended expert annotations at scale, informing
responsible deployment of LLMs in education and beyond.

### [5] [A-SEA3L-QA: A Fully Automated Self-Evolving, Adversarial Workflow for Arabic Long-Context Question-Answer Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02864)
*Kesen Wang,Daulet Toibazar,Pedro J. Moreno*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 一种防御性自我迭代流程，通过多个专门的大视觉语言模型协同工作，自动生成和精炼阿拉伯语长上下文问答数据，无需人工帮助。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决阿拉伯语长上下文问答生成的挑战，提升大视觉语言模型在复杂文档中的理解能力。

Method: 使用问题生成器、评估器和答案生成器群的防御性工作流程，通过闭环迭代精炼问题难度和相关性，支持可控难度级别调整。

Result: 构建了AraLongBench大规模阿拉伯语长上下文测试集，证明自我迭代流程显著超过静态流程，大幅提升了模型的长上下文理解能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为阿拉伯语长文档理解提供了高效的自动化解决方案，通过自我迭代和难度可控特性，为大视觉语言模型的进步做出了重要贡献。

Abstract: We present an end-to-end, self-evolving adversarial workflow for long-context
Question-Answer (QA) Generation in Arabic. By orchestrating multiple
specialized LVLMs: a question generator, an evaluator, and a swarm of answer
generators, our system iteratively refines its own performance without any
human intervention. Starting from raw, multi-page Arabic documents across
diverse domains, the question generator produces fine-grained, context-aware
queries to be tackled by the answer generator swarm, and the evaluator assesses
and feeds back quality metrics. This closed-loop cycle enables continuous
learning: low-confidence outputs trigger automated re-generation and model
updates, progressively enhancing question difficulty and relevance. Moreover,
we set the quality metrics as a tunable hyperparameter, enabling question
generation at controllable and customizable difficulty levels. We release
AraLongBench, a large-scale Arabic benchmark of single- and multi-page
challenges spanning hundreds of pages, and demonstrate that our self-evolving
workflow substantially outperform static pipelines, markedly boosting the
long-context comprehension capabilities of leading Arabic Large Vision Language
Models (LVLMs). Lastly, we also meticulously architect a fully automated
agentic workflow for long-context Arabic document collection.

### [6] [Advancing Minority Stress Detection with Transformers: Insights from the Social Media Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02908)
*Santosh Chapagain,Cory J Cascalheira,Shah Muhammad Hamdi,Soukaina Filali Boubrahimi,Jillian R. Scheer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究首次全面评估了基于Transformer的架构在检测在线话语中少数群体压力方面的表现，发现整合图结构能持续提升检测性能，图增强的Transformer模型为数字健康干预提供了最可靠的基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 性少数群体因少数群体压力而面临更高的健康问题和心理障碍风险，需要有效的方法来检测在线话语中的少数群体压力，以便进行早期干预和公共卫生政策制定。

Method: 使用ELECTRA、BERT、RoBERTa和BART等Transformer模型，与传统机器学习基线及图增强变体进行对比，评估零样本和少样本学习范式，在两个最大的公开Reddit语料库上进行实验。

Result: 整合图结构一致提高了Transformer模型的检测性能，有监督的微调结合关系上下文优于零样本和少样本方法，图增强能更好地识别身份隐藏、内化污名和求助等关键语言标记。

Conclusion: 图增强的Transformer模型在检测少数群体压力方面表现最优，为数字健康干预和公共卫生政策提供了最可靠的技术基础。

Abstract: Individuals from sexual and gender minority groups experience
disproportionately high rates of poor health outcomes and mental disorders
compared to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts, largely as a
consequence of minority stress as described by Meyer's (2003) model. This study
presents the first comprehensive evaluation of transformer-based architectures
for detecting minority stress in online discourse. We benchmark multiple
transformer models including ELECTRA, BERT, RoBERTa, and BART against
traditional machine learning baselines and graph-augmented variants. We further
assess zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms to assess their applicability
on underrepresented datasets. Experiments are conducted on the two largest
publicly available Reddit corpora for minority stress detection, comprising
12,645 and 5,789 posts, and are repeated over five random seeds to ensure
robustness. Our results demonstrate that integrating graph structure
consistently improves detection performance across transformer-only models and
that supervised fine-tuning with relational context outperforms zero and
few-shot approaches. Theoretical analysis reveals that modeling social
connectivity and conversational context via graph augmentation sharpens the
models' ability to identify key linguistic markers such as identity
concealment, internalized stigma, and calls for support, suggesting that
graph-enhanced transformers offer the most reliable foundation for digital
health interventions and public health policy.

### [7] [English Pronunciation Evaluation without Complex Joint Training: LoRA Fine-tuned Speech Multimodal LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02915)
*Taekyung Ahn,Hosung Nam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过LoRA细调多模态大语言模型，可同时完成自动发音评估和错误发音检测诊断，无需复杂结构改动或分离训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要复杂的网络结构改动和分离训练流程来同时处理APA和MDD任务，本研究该尝试通过简化的LoRA细调方法实现集成化发音评估系统。

Method: 使用Microsoft Phi-4-multimodal-instruct模型，通过Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)方法进行细调，在Speechocean762数据集上训练，只需细调LoRA层即可完成双重任务。

Result: 模型在发音评估上展现出强相关系数(PCC > 0.7)，词错误率和音素错误率均低于0.15，仅细调LoRA层的性能与细调所有音频层相当。

Conclusion: LoRA基础方法能够通过简单的训练方法建立集成化发音评估系统，为英语L2学习者提供更可访、集成和有效的计算机辅助发音训练技术。

Abstract: This study demonstrates that a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) adapted
via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can perform both Automatic Pronunciation
Assessment (APA) and Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis (MDD)
simultaneously. Leveraging Microsoft's Phi-4-multimodal-instruct, our
fine-tuning method eliminates the need for complex architectural changes or
separate training procedures conventionally required for these distinct tasks.
Fine-tuned on the Speechocean762 dataset, the pronunciation evaluation scores
predicted by the model exhibited a strong Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC
> 0.7) with human-assigned scores, while achieving low Word Error Rate (WER)
and Phoneme Error Rate (PER) (both < 0.15). Notably, fine-tuning only the LoRA
layers was sufficient to achieve performance levels comparable to those
achieved by fine-tuning all audio layers. This research highlights that an
integrated pronunciation assessment system can be established by adapting large
multimodal models without full fine-tuning, utilizing a significantly simpler
training methodology compared to previous joint models designed for
simultaneous APA and MDD. This efficient LoRA-based approach paves the way for
more accessible, integrated, and effective Computer-Assisted Pronunciation
Training (CAPT) technologies for English L2 learners.

### [8] [Decoding the Rule Book: Extracting Hidden Moderation Criteria from Reddit Communities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02926)
*Youngwoo Kim,Himanshu Beniwal,Steven L. Johnson,Thomas Hartvigsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过解释性架构从历史调解数据中提取隐式内容调解标准，以词汇表格形式展现，可系统比较不同社区的实际执行标准差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线社区如subreddits常使用多样化的隐式标准进行内容调解，需要明确分类标准来建立有效的调解系统

Method: 使用解释性架构从历史调解数据中提取隐式标准，将其表示为与内容删除相关联的词汇评分表

Result: 提取的词汇模式能够有效复现神经网络调解模型的性能，同时提供透明的决策见解，发现了社区特定语言宽容度、主题限制特征等之前未文档化的调解模式

Conclusion: 该方法能够提取并系统比较不同社区的隐式调解标准，揭示了表面共享规范的实际执行差异，为内容调解提供了透明的见解

Abstract: Effective content moderation systems require explicit classification
criteria, yet online communities like subreddits often operate with diverse,
implicit standards. This work introduces a novel approach to identify and
extract these implicit criteria from historical moderation data using an
interpretable architecture. We represent moderation criteria as score tables of
lexical expressions associated with content removal, enabling systematic
comparison across different communities. Our experiments demonstrate that these
extracted lexical patterns effectively replicate the performance of neural
moderation models while providing transparent insights into decision-making
processes. The resulting criteria matrix reveals significant variations in how
seemingly shared norms are actually enforced, uncovering previously
undocumented moderation patterns including community-specific tolerances for
language, features for topical restrictions, and underlying subcategories of
the toxic speech classification.

*Kimihiro Hasegawa,Wiradee Imrattanatrai,Masaki Asada,Susan Holm,Yuran Wang,Vincent Zhou,Ken Fukuda,Teruko Mitamura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的多模态QA数据集ProMQA-Assembly，用于评估装配任务中的助手系统，包含391个QA对，需要理解人类活动记录和说明书。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏支持装配任务应用导向系统评估的测试平台，需要促进装配助手的发展。

Method: 采用半自动QA标注方法，LLM生成候选问题，人工验证，并整合细粒度动作标签来多样化问题类型。创建了玩具车辆装配的指令任务图。

Result: 基准测试显示当前多模态模型仍有很大改进空间。

Conclusion: 新的评估数据集可以促进程序性活动助手的进一步发展。

Abstract: Assistants on assembly tasks have a large potential to benefit humans from
everyday tasks to industrial settings. However, no testbeds support
application-oriented system evaluation in a practical setting, especially in
assembly. To foster the development, we propose a new multimodal QA dataset on
assembly activities. Our dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, consists of 391 QA pairs
that require the multimodal understanding of human-activity recordings and
their instruction manuals in an online-style manner. In the development, we
adopt a semi-automated QA annotation approach, where LLMs generate candidates
and humans verify them, as a cost-effective method, and further improve it by
integrating fine-grained action labels to diversify question types.
Furthermore, we create instruction task graphs for the target tasks of
assembling toy vehicles. These newly created task graphs are used in our
benchmarking experiment, as well as to facilitate the human verification
process in the QA annotation. Utilizing our dataset, we benchmark models,
including competitive proprietary multimodal models. Our results suggest great
room for improvement for the current models. We believe our new evaluation
dataset can contribute to the further development of procedural-activity
assistants.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文构建了一个基于认知行为疗法(CBT)的长周期心理咨询对话数据集DiaCBT，用于训练更专业的心理咨询模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理治疗遍及率低，缺少专业心理对话数据集阻碍了心理咨询模型的发展。

Method: 构建包含多个咨询会议和认知概念图(CCDs)的CBT基础对话数据集，训练深度咨询模型并评估。

Result: DiaCBT数据集有效提升了大语言模型模仿CBT专家心理学家的能力。

Conclusion: 该数据集为训练更专业的心理咨询对话系统提供了潜力。

Abstract: Psychotherapy reaches only a small fraction of individuals suffering from
mental disorders due to social stigma and the limited availability of
therapists. Large language models (LLMs), when equipped with professional
psychotherapeutic skills, offer a promising solution to expand access to mental
health services. However, the lack of psychological conversation datasets
presents significant challenges in developing effective psychotherapy-guided
conversational agents. In this paper, we construct a long-periodic dialogue
corpus for counseling based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Our curated
dataset includes multiple sessions for each counseling and incorporates
cognitive conceptualization diagrams (CCDs) to guide client simulation across
diverse scenarios. To evaluate the utility of our dataset, we train an in-depth
counseling model and present a comprehensive evaluation framework to benchmark
it against established psychological criteria for CBT-based counseling. Results
demonstrate that DiaCBT effectively enhances LLMs' ability to emulate
psychologists with CBT expertise, underscoring its potential for training more
professional counseling agents.

*Fong-Chun Tsai,Kuan-Tang Huang,Bi-Cheng Yan,Tien-Hong Lo,Berlin Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过提出BLV损失函数，改善自动说话评估模型的类别不平衡问题，提高少数类的识别准确性和公平性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动说话评估(ASA)模型面临类别不平衡问题，导致对少数类的偏见预测

Method: 提出新的Balancing Logit Variation (BLV)损失函数，通过干扰模型预测来改善少数类的特征表征，无需修改数据集

Result: 在ICNALE数据集上，将BLV损失集成到BERT模型中显著提高了分类准确性和公平性

Conclusion: BLV损失函数能够有效解决ASA模型的类别不平衡问题，使得自动语音评估更加健壮适用于多样化的学习者

Abstract: Automated Speaking Assessment (ASA) plays a crucial role in evaluating
second-language (L2) learners proficiency. However, ASA models often suffer
from class imbalance, leading to biased predictions. To address this, we
introduce a novel objective for training ASA models, dubbed the Balancing Logit
Variation (BLV) loss, which perturbs model predictions to improve feature
representation for minority classes without modifying the dataset. Evaluations
on the ICNALE benchmark dataset show that integrating the BLV loss into a
celebrated text-based (BERT) model significantly enhances classification
accuracy and fairness, making automated speech evaluation more robust for
diverse learners.

### [12] [Training LLMs to be Better Text Embedders through Bidirectional Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03020)
*Chang Su,Dengliang Shi,Siyuan Huang,Jintao Du,Changhua Meng,Yu Cheng,Weiqiang Wang,Zhouhan Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出在对比学习前增加双向生成重建训练阶段，通过EBQ2D和EBD2Q任务增强[EOS]标记的语义表示能力，显著提升LLM在文本嵌入任务上的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM文本嵌入方法使用[EOS]等特殊标记的嵌入，但这些标记未经过专门训练来捕获整个上下文的语义，限制了在检索和重排序任务中的能力

Method: 在对比学习前增加新的训练阶段，采用双向生成重建任务：EBQ2D（基于嵌入的查询到文档重建）和EBD2Q（基于嵌入的文档到查询重建），交替进行以锚定[EOS]嵌入并重建查询-文档对的两端

Result: 在Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB)上显著提升LLM性能，在不同LLM基础模型和规模上都达到了新的最先进结果

Conclusion: 通过增加专门的双向生成重建训练阶段，可以有效增强[EOS]标记的语义表示能力，从而显著提升LLM在文本嵌入任务中的表现

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been explored as powerful text
embedders. Existing LLM-based text embedding approaches often leverage the
embedding of the final token, typically a reserved special token such as [EOS].
However, these tokens have not been intentionally trained to capture the
semantics of the whole context, limiting their capacity as text embeddings,
especially for retrieval and re-ranking tasks. We propose to add a new training
stage before contrastive learning to enrich the semantics of the final token
embedding. This stage employs bidirectional generative reconstruction tasks,
namely EBQ2D (Embedding-Based Query-to-Document) and EBD2Q (Embedding-Based
Document-to-Query), which interleave to anchor the [EOS] embedding and
reconstruct either side of Query-Document pairs. Experimental results
demonstrate that our additional training stage significantly improves LLM
performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), achieving new
state-of-the-art results across different LLM base models and scales.

Result: 在多个多任务自然语言理解任务上，该方法在准确率、压缩率和对噪声及干扰的稳健性方面完胜主流的参数高效调整技术，实现了更好的性能平衡。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的结构可学习适配器方法有效解决了传统微调方法的局限性，在保持高效参数利用的同时提升了模型的表征能力和稳健性，为大语言模型的灵活微调提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the issues of parameter redundancy, rigid structure, and
limited task adaptability in the fine-tuning of large language models. It
proposes an adapter-based fine-tuning method built on a structure-learnable
mechanism. By introducing differentiable gating functions and structural
sparsity control variables, the method enables automatic optimization of
adapter insertion points, activation paths, and module combinations. This
allows the model to adjust its structure flexibly in multi-task settings to
match different task characteristics. With the backbone parameters kept frozen,
the method uses a structure search mechanism to guide the dynamic construction
of task-specific efficient substructures during training. This significantly
improves parameter utilization and representational capacity. In addition, the
paper designs a set of sensitivity analysis experiments to systematically
evaluate the effects of sparsity weight, noise injection ratio, and data
perturbation on model performance. These experiments verify the stability and
robustness of the proposed method across various multi-task natural language
understanding tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms mainstream parameter-efficient tuning techniques on multiple tasks.
It achieves a better balance among accuracy, compression rate, and robustness
to noise and perturbation.

Abstract: Business sentiment analysis (BSA) is one of the significant and popular
topics of natural language processing. It is one kind of sentiment analysis
techniques for business purposes. Different categories of sentiment analysis
techniques like lexicon-based techniques and different types of machine
learning algorithms are applied for sentiment analysis on different languages
like English, Hindi, Spanish, etc. In this paper, long short-term memory (LSTM)
is applied for business sentiment analysis, where a recurrent neural network is
used. An LSTM model is used in a modified approach to prevent the vanishing
gradient problem rather than applying the conventional recurrent neural network
(RNN). To apply the modified RNN model, product review dataset is used. In this
experiment, 70\% of the data is trained for the LSTM and the rest 30\% of the
data is used for testing. The result of this modified RNN model is compared
with other conventional RNN models, and a comparison is made among the results.
It is noted that the proposed model performs better than the other conventional
RNN models. Here, the proposed model, i.e., the modified RNN model approach has
achieved around 91.33\% of accuracy. By applying this model, any business
company or e-commerce business site can identify the feedback from their
customers about different types of products that customers like or dislike.
Based on the customer reviews, a business company or e-commerce platform can
evaluate its marketing strategy.

TL;DR: 这篇论文评估了大语言模型在社会科学中测量连续语义结构的四种方法，发现使用词汇概率加权的点评分和小规模细调模型表现最佳


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言的复杂性和情感性等构造具有自然的连续语义结构，大语言模型是测量这些标量构造的有吸引力工具，但其对数值输出的特异处理方式需要评估

Method: 使用政治学文献中的多个数据集，评估四种方法：直接点评分法、成对比较聚合法、词汇概率加权点评分法和细调模型法

Result: 直接点评分产生不连续分布，成对比较改善质量，但词汇概率加权点评分表现更好，仅用1000个训练对的小模型细调即可超过提示模型

Conclusion: 对应用研究者的建议是使用词汇概率加权点评分或者细调小模型来测量连续语义结构，这些方法比直接点评分和成对比较方法更有效

Abstract: Many constructs that characterize language, like its complexity or
emotionality, have a naturally continuous semantic structure; a public speech
is not just "simple" or "complex," but exists on a continuum between extremes.
Although large language models (LLMs) are an attractive tool for measuring
scalar constructs, their idiosyncratic treatment of numerical outputs raises
questions of how to best apply them. We address these questions with a
comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based approaches to scalar construct
measurement in social science. Using multiple datasets sourced from the
political science literature, we evaluate four approaches: unweighted direct
pointwise scoring, aggregation of pairwise comparisons,
token-probability-weighted pointwise scoring, and finetuning. Our study yields
actionable findings for applied researchers. First, LLMs prompted to generate
pointwise scores directly from texts produce discontinuous distributions with
bunching at arbitrary numbers. The quality of the measurements improves with
pairwise comparisons made by LLMs, but it improves even more by taking
pointwise scores and weighting them by token probability. Finally, finetuning
smaller models with as few as 1,000 training pairs can match or exceed the
performance of prompted LLMs.

TL;DR: 通过知识编辑技术向大语言模型注入指纹，提出FSFT方法减少细调时指纹退化，但现有方法在区分指纹与相似文本时仍遇到困难


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的指令循环指纹注入方法对模型性能影响大、计算成本高且持续性差，需要轻量级的替代方案

Method: 首次将知识编辑应用于指纹注入，使用类似乱码的文本作为指纹，并提出Fingerprint Subspace-aware Fine-Tuning (FSFT)方法来约束指纹子空间的更新

Result: FSFT方法在最坏情况下也能比普通细调提高10%的性能，但发现注入指纹的模型在区分指纹与相似文本时仍遇到困难

Conclusion: 知识编辑是一种有效的轻量级指纹注入方法，FSFT能显著减少细调时的指纹退化，但现有方法在区分度上仍有限，需要更精细和健壮的指纹注入技术

Abstract: The intellectual property (IP) protection of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
increasingly critical. Injecting specialized fingerprints into LLMs through
instruction tuning is a common IP protection technique. However, this may
significantly degrade model performance, requires substantial computational
resources, and exhibits poor persistence under model modifications. We argue
that knowledge editing offers a lightweight alternative that is more suitable
for fingerprint injection. Accordingly, we apply knowledge editing to
fingerprint injection for the first time and demonstrate its strong capability.
Despite using scrambled text as fingerprints to prevent them from being
overwritten during fine-tuning, degradation still occurs under large-scale
fine-tuning. To address this, we propose Fingerprint Subspace-aware Fine-Tuning
(FSFT), which reduces fingerprint degradation by constraining the update of the
fingerprint subspace. The performance of FSFT exceeds fine-tuning by 10% even
in the worst-case scenario. Additionally, we observe that the
fingerprint-injected models struggle to distinguish between fingerprints and
similar texts due to the high similarity of their features. This finding
underscores the urgent need for more robust and fine-grained fingerprinting
injection methods for LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究辨别性词典模型在爱沙尼亚语词汇处理中的预测能力，以及与经典预测因子如词频、邻居规模和谜变范弋规模的比较。

Method: 采用单人大规模眼动追踪命名任务，对五个反应变量进行广义加性模型分析，比较线性和深度映射的DLM模型预测能力。

Result: DLM基于清单预测能力强劲，但经典预测因子预测精度略高（总回视时间除外）；深度学习映射未显著提升预测精度；命名任务中词汇变量对首次回视时间和回视次数无预测能力。

Conclusion: 辨别性词典模型在词汇处理中具有重要价值，但经典预测因子仍有优势；意义在命名任务中受到重视，说明语义参与了词汇处理过程。

Abstract: This study investigates lexical processing in Estonian. A large-scale
single-subject experiment is reported that combines the word naming task with
eye-tracking. Five response variables (first fixation duration, total fixation
duration, number of fixations, word naming latency, and spoken word duration)
are analyzed with the generalized additive model. Of central interest is the
question of whether measures for lexical processing generated by a
computational model of the mental lexicon (the Discriminative Lexicon Model,
DLM) are predictive for these response variables, and how they compare to
classical predictors such as word frequency, neighborhood size, and
inflectional paradigm size. Computational models were implemented both with
linear and deep mappings. Central findings are, first, that DLM-based measures
are powerful predictors for lexical processing, second, that DLM-measures using
deep learning are not necessarily more precise predictors of lexical processing
than DLM-measures using linear mappings, third, that classical predictors tend
to provide somewhat more precise fits compared to DLM-based predictors (except
for total fixation duration, where the two provide equivalent goodness of fit),
and fourth, that in the naming task lexical variables are not predictive for
first fixation duration and the total number of fixations. As the DLM works
with mappings from form to meaning, the predictivity of DLM-based measures for
total fixation duration, naming latencies, and spoken word duration indicates
that meaning is heavily involved in the present word naming task.

Abstract: The Romansh language, spoken in Switzerland, has limited resources for
machine translation evaluation. In this paper, we present a benchmark for six
varieties of Romansh: Rumantsch Grischun, a supra-regional variety, and five
regional varieties: Sursilvan, Sutsilvan, Surmiran, Puter, and Vallader. Our
reference translations were created by human translators based on the WMT24++
benchmark, which ensures parallelism with more than 55 other languages. An
automatic evaluation of existing MT systems and LLMs shows that translation out
of Romansh into German is handled relatively well for all the varieties, but
translation into Romansh is still challenging.

Motivation: 当前过程挖掘领域中的LLM应用主要集中在提示工程或将事件日志转换为叙事格式。本研究动机在于直接利用LLM在生成序列令牌方面的优势，避免自然语言重构的需求。

Method: 采用参数高效微调技术，直接将预训练LLM适配到过程数据。实验设置以预测性过程监控为中心，考虑单任务和多任务预测。

Result: 在多任务设置下，微调后的LLM在预测性能方面超过了最先进的RNN方法和最新的叙事格式解决方案。同时展现出更快的收敛速度和更少的超参数优化需求。

Conclusion: 直接将LLM应用于过程数据而不需要自然语言重构是可行且有效的。参数高效微调技术能够减少计算开销，并在多任务预测中实现更优秀的性能。

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a prominent
area of interest across various research domains, including Process Mining
(PM). Current applications in PM have predominantly centered on prompt
engineering strategies or the transformation of event logs into narrative-style
datasets, thereby exploiting the semantic capabilities of LLMs to address
diverse tasks. In contrast, this study investigates the direct adaptation of
pretrained LLMs to process data without natural language reformulation,
motivated by the fact that these models excel in generating sequences of
tokens, similar to the objective in PM. More specifically, we focus on
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to mitigate the computational
overhead typically associated with such models. Our experimental setup focuses
on Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM), and considers both single- and
multi-task predictions. The results demonstrate a potential improvement in
predictive performance over state-of-the-art recurrent neural network (RNN)
approaches and recent narrative-style-based solutions, particularly in the
multi-task setting. Additionally, our fine-tuned models exhibit faster
convergence and require significantly less hyperparameter optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估主要关注全球性或英语中心主题，忽视了低资源语言和文化特定内容。现有多语言基准多依赖自动翻译，可能引入错误并扭曲原始文化背景。

Method: 创建SinhalaMMLU数据集，包含7000+个基于斯里兰卡国家课程的多选题，涵盖6个领域30个科目，包含通用学术知识和文化基础知识。使用该数据集评估26个LLM的性能。

Result: Claude 3.5 sonnet和GPT-4o表现最佳，平均准确率分别为67%和62%，但整体模型性能有限。模型在人文学科等文化丰富领域表现尤其不佳。

Conclusion: LLM在适应低资源语言和特定文化语境方面仍有显著改进空间，特别是在处理文化丰富内容时表现不足，需要更多针对性的开发和评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general knowledge and
reasoning abilities, yet their evaluation has predominantly focused on global
or anglocentric subjects, often neglecting low-resource languages and
culturally specific content. While recent multilingual benchmarks attempt to
bridge this gap, many rely on automatic translation, which can introduce errors
and misrepresent the original cultural context. To address this, we introduce
SinhalaMMLU, the first multiple-choice question answering benchmark designed
specifically for Sinhala, a low-resource language. The dataset includes over
7,000 questions spanning secondary to collegiate education levels, aligned with
the Sri Lankan national curriculum, and covers six domains and 30 subjects,
encompassing both general academic topics and culturally grounded knowledge. We
evaluate 26 LLMs on SinhalaMMLU and observe that, while Claude 3.5 sonnet and
GPT-4o achieve the highest average accuracies at 67% and 62% respectively,
overall model performance remains limited. In particular, models struggle in
culturally rich domains such as the Humanities, revealing substantial room for
improvement in adapting LLMs to low-resource and culturally specific contexts.

TL;DR: AgenTracer是一个自动化框架，通过反事实重放和编程故障注入来标注多智能体系统失败轨迹，并训练出轻量级故障追踪模型AgenTracer-8B，在故障归因任务上超越大型专有LLM，并能提升现有多智能体系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based多智能体系统虽然性能优越但脆弱性高，当前最先进的推理LLM在故障归因任务上准确率低于10%，需要专门解决方案来诊断多智能体交互中的错误。

Method: 提出AgenTracer框架：1) 通过反事实重放和编程故障注入自动标注失败轨迹，构建TracerTraj数据集；2) 使用多粒度强化学习训练轻量级故障追踪模型AgenTracer-8B。

Result: 在Who&When基准测试中，AgenTracer-8B比Gemini-2.5-Pro和Claude-4-Sonnet等大型专有LLM性能提升高达18.18%，并为MetaGPT和MaAS等现有多智能体系统带来4.8-14.2%的性能提升。

Conclusion: AgenTracer-8B为多智能体系统故障归因设立了新标准，能够提供可操作的反馈，赋能自校正和自进化的智能体AI系统。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems, often comprising multiple
models, complex tool invocations, and orchestration protocols, substantially
outperform monolithic agents. Yet this very sophistication amplifies their
fragility, making them more prone to system failure. Pinpointing the specific
agent or step responsible for an error within long execution traces defines the
task of agentic system failure attribution. Current state-of-the-art reasoning
LLMs, however, remain strikingly inadequate for this challenge, with accuracy
generally below 10%. To address this gap, we propose AgenTracer, the first
automated framework for annotating failed multi-agent trajectories via
counterfactual replay and programmed fault injection, producing the curated
dataset TracerTraj. Leveraging this resource, we develop AgenTracer-8B, a
lightweight failure tracer trained with multi-granular reinforcement learning,
capable of efficiently diagnosing errors in verbose multi-agent interactions.
On the Who&When benchmark, AgenTracer-8B outperforms giant proprietary LLMs
like Gemini-2.5-Pro and Claude-4-Sonnet by up to 18.18%, setting a new standard
in LLM agentic failure attribution. More importantly, AgenTracer-8B delivers
actionable feedback to off-the-shelf multi-agent systems like MetaGPT and MaAS
with 4.8-14.2% performance gains, empowering self-correcting and self-evolving
agentic AI.

Motivation: 理解语言模型如何将数据转化为世界知识和信念的内部过程，以开发更一致、鲁棒和完整的知识表示。

Method: 提出LMEnt套件：1）基于Wikipedia的知识丰富预训练语料库，完全标注实体提及；2）实体检索方法，性能比之前方法提升80.4%；3）12个预训练模型（最多10亿参数）和4000个中间检查点。

Result: LMEnt在知识基准测试中与流行的开源模型性能相当，通过研究发现事实频率是关键因素，但不能完全解释学习趋势。

Conclusion: LMEnt为研究语言模型中的知识表示、可塑性、编辑、归因和学习动态提供了有价值的资源和支持。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) increasingly drive real-world applications that require
world knowledge. However, the internal processes through which models turn data
into representations of knowledge and beliefs about the world, are poorly
understood. Insights into these processes could pave the way for developing LMs
with knowledge representations that are more consistent, robust, and complete.
To facilitate studying these questions, we present LMEnt, a suite for analyzing
knowledge acquisition in LMs during pretraining. LMEnt introduces: (1) a
knowledge-rich pretraining corpus, fully annotated with entity mentions, based
on Wikipedia, (2) an entity-based retrieval method over pretraining data that
outperforms previous approaches by as much as 80.4%, and (3) 12 pretrained
models with up to 1B parameters and 4K intermediate checkpoints, with
comparable performance to popular open-sourced models on knowledge benchmarks.
Together, these resources provide a controlled environment for analyzing
connections between entity mentions in pretraining and downstream performance,
and the effects of causal interventions in pretraining data. We show the
utility of LMEnt by studying knowledge acquisition across checkpoints, finding
that fact frequency is key, but does not fully explain learning trends. We
release LMEnt to support studies of knowledge in LMs, including knowledge
representations, plasticity, editing, attribution, and learning dynamics.

Motivation: 研究预训练的成功机制，探索预训练准确率与下游分类任务微调之间的相互作用关系。

Method: 使用BERT-6架构在Wikipedia数据集上进行预训练，然后在FewRel和DBpedia分类任务上进行微调，分析token准确率、混淆矩阵和transformer块的表现。

Result: 预训练使token按出现频率分组形成强匹配簇，沿transformer块向输出层性能显著提升；预训练成功指标与微调准确率正相关；输出标签预测置信度与平均输入APT无关。

Conclusion: 预训练即使只针对单个token识别，也能生成高阶语言结构；预训练机制在NLP分类任务中具有普适性，与图像分类的微调机制相似。

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) enables the understanding and generation of
meaningful human language, typically using a pre-trained complex architecture
on a large dataset to learn the language and next fine-tune its weights to
implement a specific task. Twofold goals are examined; to understand the
mechanism underlying successful pre-training and to determine the interplay
between the pre-training accuracy and the fine-tuning of classification tasks.
The following main results were obtained; the accuracy per token (APT)
increased with its appearance frequency in the dataset, and its average over
all tokens served as an order parameter to quantify pre-training success, which
increased along the transformer blocks. Pre-training broke the symmetry among
tokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as
inferred from the presented token confusion matrix. This feature was sharpened
along the transformer blocks toward the output layer, enhancing its performance
considerably compared with that of the embedding layer. Consequently,
higher-order language structures were generated by pre-training, even though
the learning cost function was directed solely at identifying a single token.
These pre-training findings were reflected by the improved fine-tuning accuracy
along the transformer blocks. Additionally, the output label prediction
confidence was found to be independent of the average input APT, as the input
meaning was preserved since the tokens are replaced primarily by strong match
tokens. Finally, although pre-training is commonly absent in image
classification tasks, its underlying mechanism is similar to that used in
fine-tuning NLP classification tasks, hinting at its universality. The results
were based on the BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on the Wikipedia dataset and
fine-tuned on the FewRel and DBpedia classification tasks.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力提升，复杂任务的可靠评估变得更加困难。虽然LLM作为评测者的方法已成为可扩展解决方案，但之前研究主要关注简单场景，在复杂任务中的可靠性仍然不足

Method: 构建ComplexEval挑战性测试集，系统性地曝露和量化辅助信息引发的偏差。在12个基础场景和3个高级场景中调查和验证了6种之前未经探索的偏差

Result: 关键发现：(1)所有评估模型都显示出对这些偏差的显著敏感性，偏差程度随任务复杂性增加而增大；(2)大型推理模型(LRM)展现出矛盾的弱点

Conclusion: 深入分析为提高评估信号的准确性和可验证性提供了关键见解，为开发更通用和稳健的评估模型掘平了道路

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow more capable, they face increasingly
diverse and complex tasks, making reliable evaluation challenging. The paradigm
of LLMs as judges has emerged as a scalable solution, yet prior work primarily
focuses on simple settings. Their reliability in complex tasks--where
multi-faceted rubrics, unstructured reference answers, and nuanced criteria are
critical--remains understudied. In this paper, we constructed ComplexEval, a
challenge benchmark designed to systematically expose and quantify Auxiliary
Information Induced Biases. We systematically investigated and validated 6
previously unexplored biases across 12 basic and 3 advanced scenarios. Key
findings reveal: (1) all evaluated models exhibit significant susceptibility to
these biases, with bias magnitude scaling with task complexity; (2) notably,
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) show paradoxical vulnerability. Our in-depth
analysis offers crucial insights for improving the accuracy and verifiability
of evaluation signals, paving the way for more general and robust evaluation
models.

on Saudi Sign Language (SSL) as their primary form of communication. Although
certain technological approaches have helped to improve communication for
individuals with hearing impairments, there continues to be an urgent
requirement for more precise and dependable translation techniques, especially
for Arabic sign language variants like SSL. Most state-of-the-art solutions
have primarily focused on non-Arabic sign languages, resulting in a
considerable absence of resources dedicated to Arabic sign language,
specifically SSL. The complexity of the Arabic language and the prevalence of
isolated sign language datasets that concentrate on individual words instead of
continuous speech contribute to this issue. To address this gap, our research
represents an important step in developing SSL resources. To address this, we
introduce the first continuous Saudi Sign Language dataset called KAU-CSSL,
focusing on complete sentences to facilitate further research and enable
sophisticated recognition systems for SSL recognition and translation.
Additionally, we propose a transformer-based model, utilizing a pretrained
ResNet-18 for spatial feature extraction and a Transformer Encoder with
Bidirectional LSTM for temporal dependencies, achieving 99.02\% accuracy at
signer dependent mode and 77.71\% accuracy at signer independent mode. This
development leads the way to not only improving communication tools for the SSL
community but also making a substantial contribution to the wider field of sign
language.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
generalization across tasks using images and text modalities. While their
extension to video has enabled tasks such as video question answering and video
captioning, their pixel-level visual grounding abilities are less studied. In
this work, we raise the pertinent question of whether motion is used in
pixel-level visual grounding and whether video MLLMs can segment objects based
on natural language expressions describing their motion patterns. We identify
the shortcomings in the current benchmarks, where we show that a single frame
can often suffice for capturing the motion referring expression without any
temporal reasoning. To address this, we introduce four motion-centric probing
techniques, particularly designed for the visual grounding task, to study video
MLLMs' ability to identify true motion from a fake one and their ability to
grasp the motion order. Consequently, we provide a motion-centric benchmark,
MoCentric-Bench. It ensures that video MLLMs are evaluated towards leveraging
the interaction between motion and language rather than being dominated by
static appearance cues emphasized in existing visual grounding datasets. We
further establish strong single-image baselines that are on par with or
outperform prior methods. Finally, we explore simple motion-centric adaptation
techniques that provide state-of-the-art performance on our MoCentric-Bench.
Our motion-centric benchmark, evaluation and findings challenge future models
to improve dense spatiotemporal grounding and pixel-level understanding within
videos. Code and datasets will be made publicly available at

Abstract: Colon cancer also known as Colorectal cancer, is one of the most malignant
types of cancer worldwide. Early-stage detection of colon cancer is highly
crucial to prevent its deterioration. This research presents a hybrid
multi-scale deep learning architecture that synergizes capsule networks, graph
attention mechanisms, transformer modules, and residual learning to advance
colon cancer classification on the Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological
Image Dataset (LC25000) dataset. The proposed model in this paper utilizes the
HG-TNet model that introduces a hybrid architecture that joins strength points
in transformers and convolutional neural networks to capture multi-scale
features in histopathological images. Mainly, a transformer branch extracts
global contextual bonds by partitioning the image into patches by
convolution-based patch embedding and then processing these patches through a
transformer encoder. Analogously, a dedicated CNN branch captures fine-grained,
local details through successive Incorporation these diverse features, combined
with a self-supervised rotation prediction objective, produce a robust
diagnostic representation that surpasses standard architectures in performance.
Results show better performance not only in accuracy or loss function but also
in these algorithms by utilizing capsule networks to preserve spatial orders
and realize how each element individually combines and forms whole structures.

Conclusion: 该方法能提高主动脉狭窄诊断效率，使超声心动图评估更加高效、可扩展和个性化

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a life-threatening condition caused by a narrowing of
the aortic valve, leading to impaired blood flow. Despite its high prevalence,
access to echocardiography (echo), the gold-standard diagnostic tool, is often
limited due to resource constraints, particularly in rural and underserved
areas. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) offers a more accessible alternative
but is restricted by operator expertise and the challenge of selecting the most
relevant imaging views. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning
(RL)-driven active video acquisition framework that dynamically selects each
patient's most informative echo videos. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
a fixed set of videos, our approach continuously evaluates whether additional
imaging is needed, optimizing both accuracy and efficiency. Tested on data from
2,572 patients, our method achieves 80.6% classification accuracy while using
only 47% of the echo videos compared to a full acquisition. These results
demonstrate the potential of active feature acquisition to enhance AS
diagnosis, making echocardiographic assessments more efficient, scalable, and
personalized. Our source code is available at:

Abstract: There is a growing interest in the development of lidar-based autonomous
mobility and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). To operate and research
on lidar data, researchers often develop code specific to application niche.
This approach leads to duplication of efforts across studies that, in many
cases, share multiple methodological steps such as data input/output (I/O),
pre/post processing, and common algorithms in multi-stage solutions. Moreover,
slight changes in data, algorithms, and/or research focus may force major
revisions in the code. To address these challenges, we present LiGuard, an
open-source software framework that allows researchers to: 1) rapidly develop
code for their lidar-based projects by providing built-in support for data I/O,
pre/post processing, and commonly used algorithms, 2) interactively
add/remove/reorder custom algorithms and adjust their parameters, and 3)
visualize results for classification, detection, segmentation, and tracking
tasks. Moreover, because it creates all the code files in structured
directories, it allows easy sharing of entire projects or even the individual
components to be reused by other researchers. The effectiveness of LiGuard is
demonstrated via case studies.

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), for tasks
such as object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance segmentation, is
predominantly solved by deep neural network models which often require
large-scale labeled datasets during training to achieve generalization.
However, creating these datasets is costly. time consuming and require human
labor before the datasets are ready for training models. This hinders
scalability of the LiDAR-based perception systems in ITS. Sim2Real learning
offers scalable alternative, however, its effectiveness is dependent on the
fidelity of the source simulation(s) to real-world, in terms of environment
structure, actor dynamics, and sensor emulations. In response, this paper
introduces a rigorous and reproducible methodology for creating large-scale,
high-quality synthetic datasets using High-Fidelity Digital Twins (HiFi DTs).
The proposed workflow outlines the steps, tools, and best practices for
digitally replicating real-world environments, encompassing static geometry
modeling, road infrastructure replication, and dynamic traffic scenario
generation. Leveraging open-source and readily available resources such as
satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap data, alongside specific sensor
configurations, this paper provides practical, detailed guidance for
constructing robust synthetic environments. These environments subsequently
facilitate scalable, cost-effective, and diverse dataset generation, forming a
reliable foundation for robust Sim2Real learning.

Abstract: Sim2Real domain transfer offers a cost-effective and scalable approach for
developing LiDAR-based perception (e.g., object detection, tracking,
segmentation) in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, perception
models trained in simulation often under perform on real-world data due to
distributional shifts. To address this Sim2Real gap, this paper proposes a
high-fidelity digital twin (HiFi DT) framework that incorporates real-world
background geometry, lane-level road topology, and sensor-specific
specifications and placement. We formalize the domain adaptation challenge
underlying Sim2Real learning and present a systematic method for constructing
simulation environments that yield in-domain synthetic data. An off-the-shelf
3D object detector is trained on HiFi DT-generated synthetic data and evaluated
on real data. Our experiments show that the DT-trained model outperforms the
equivalent model trained on real data by 4.8%. To understand this gain, we
quantify distributional alignment between synthetic and real data using
multiple metrics, including Chamfer Distance (CD), Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(MMD), Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), and Fr'echet Distance (FD), at both
raw-input and latent-feature levels. Results demonstrate that HiFi DTs
substantially reduce domain shift and improve generalization across diverse
evaluation scenarios. These findings underscore the significant role of digital
twins in enabling reliable, simulation-based LiDAR perception for real-world
ITS applications.

Conclusion: 神经符号集成是构建临床鲁棒、域不变医学AI系统的有前景范式，符号组件不仅增强可解释性，还作为有效正则化器。

Abstract: Domain generalization remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where
models trained on single sources often fail under real-world distribution
shifts. We propose KG-DG, a neuro-symbolic framework for diabetic retinopathy
(DR) classification that integrates vision transformers with expert-guided
symbolic reasoning to enable robust generalization across unseen domains. Our
approach leverages clinical lesion ontologies through structured, rule-based
features and retinal vessel segmentation, fusing them with deep visual
representations via a confidence-weighted integration strategy. The framework
addresses both single-domain generalization (SDG) and multi-domain
generalization (MDG) by minimizing the KL divergence between domain embeddings,
thereby enforcing alignment of high-level clinical semantics. Extensive
experiments across four public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1,
Messidor-2) demonstrate significant improvements: up to a 5.2% accuracy gain in
cross-domain settings and a 6% improvement over baseline ViT models. Notably,
our symbolic-only model achieves a 63.67% average accuracy in MDG, while the
complete neuro-symbolic integration achieves the highest accuracy compared to
existing published baselines and benchmarks in challenging SDG scenarios.
Ablation studies reveal that lesion-based features (84.65% accuracy)
substantially outperform purely neural approaches, confirming that symbolic
components act as effective regularizers beyond merely enhancing
interpretability. Our findings establish neuro-symbolic integration as a
promising paradigm for building clinically robust, and domain-invariant medical
AI systems.

Abstract: Registration of serial whole-slide histopathological images (WSIs) is
critical for enabling direct comparison across diverse stains and for preparing
paired datasets in artificial intelligence (AI) workflows such as virtual
staining and biomarker prediction. While existing methods often rely on complex
deformable or deep learning approaches that are computationally intensive and
difficult to reproduce, lightweight rigid frameworks-sufficient for many
consecutive-section scenarios-remain underdeveloped. We introduce STAR (Serial
Tissue Alignment for Rigid registration), a fast and robust open-source
framework for multi-WSI alignment. STAR integrates stain-conditioned
preprocessing with a hierarchical coarse-to-fine correlation strategy, adaptive
kernel scaling, and built-in quality control, achieving reliable rigid
registration across heterogeneous tissue types and staining protocols,
including hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), special histochemical stains (e.g., PAS,
PASM, Masson's), and immunohistochemical (IHC) markers (e.g., CD31, KI67).
Evaluated on the ANHIR 2019 and ACROBAT 2022 datasets spanning multiple organs
and scanning conditions, STAR consistently produced stable alignments within
minutes per slide, demonstrating robustness to cross-stain variability and
partial tissue overlap. Beyond benchmarks, we present case studies on H&E-IHC
alignment, construction of multi-IHC panels, and typical failure modes,
underscoring both utility and limitations. Released as an open and lightweight
tool, STAR provides a reproducible baseline that lowers the barrier for
clinical adoption and enables large-scale paired data preparation for
next-generation computational pathology.

Abstract: Multimodal industrial surface defect detection (MISDD) aims to identify and
locate defect in industrial products by fusing RGB and 3D modalities. This
article focuses on modality-missing problems caused by uncertain sensors
availability in MISDD. In this context, the fusion of multiple modalities
encounters several troubles, including learning mode transformation and
information vacancy. To this end, we first propose cross-modal prompt learning,
which includes: i) the cross-modal consistency prompt serves the establishment
of information consistency of dual visual modalities; ii) the modality-specific
prompt is inserted to adapt different input patterns; iii) the missing-aware
prompt is attached to compensate for the information vacancy caused by dynamic
modalities-missing. In addition, we propose symmetric contrastive learning,
which utilizes text modality as a bridge for fusion of dual vision modalities.
Specifically, a paired antithetical text prompt is designed to generate binary
text semantics, and triple-modal contrastive pre-training is offered to
accomplish multimodal learning. Experiment results show that our proposed
method achieves 73.83% I-AUROC and 93.05% P-AUROC with a total missing rate 0.7
for RGB and 3D modalities (exceeding state-of-the-art methods 3.84% and 5.58%
respectively), and outperforms existing approaches to varying degrees under
different missing types and rates. The source code will be available at

TL;DR: EdgeAttNet是一种基于U-Net的太阳细丝分割架构，通过引入可学习的边缘图来增强自注意力机制，显著提高了细丝边界和分支的识别精度。


<details>

Method: 在U-Net骨干网络基础上，直接从输入图像生成可学习边缘图，并将边缘信息线性变换到注意力机制的Key和Query矩阵中，引导网络瓶颈处的自注意力更有效地捕捉细丝边界。

Conclusion: 通过将结构先验显式整合到注意力计算中，EdgeAttNet在减少可训练参数的同时，增强了空间敏感性和分割准确性，适合实际部署应用。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of solar filaments in H-alpha observations is critical
for determining filament chirality, a key factor in the behavior of Coronal
Mass Ejections (CMEs). However, existing methods often fail to capture
fine-scale filament structures, particularly barbs, due to a limited ability to
model long-range dependencies and spatial detail.
  We propose EdgeAttNet, a segmentation architecture built on a U-Net backbone
by introducing a novel, learnable edge map derived directly from the input
image. This edge map is incorporated into the model by linearly transforming
the attention Key and Query matrices with the edge information, thereby guiding
the self-attention mechanism at the network's bottleneck to more effectively
capture filament boundaries and barbs. By explicitly integrating this
structural prior into the attention computations, EdgeAttNet enhances spatial
sensitivity and segmentation accuracy while reducing the number of trainable
parameters.
  Trained end-to-end, EdgeAttNet outperforms U-Net and other U-Net-based
transformer baselines on the MAGFILO dataset. It achieves higher segmentation
accuracy and significantly better recognition of filament barbs, with faster
inference performance suitable for practical deployment.

TL;DR: KEPT是一个知识增强的视觉语言模型框架，通过检索增强和链式思维提示来提升自动驾驶中的短时轨迹预测性能，在nuScenes数据集上达到了最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在自动驾驶轨迹预测中难以有效结合场景动态和领域知识，需要一种能够有效利用先验知识的方法来提升预测准确性和安全性。

Method: 结合时间频率-空间融合视频编码器、k-means+HNSW检索堆栈提供场景对齐示例，通过链式思维提示嵌入检索先验，采用三阶段微调策略逐步对齐语言头。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，NoAvg协议下达到0.70m平均L2误差和0.21%碰撞率；TemAvg协议下达到0.31m平均L2误差和0.07%碰撞率，检索延迟亚毫秒级。

Conclusion: 检索增强的链式思维引导视觉语言模型为可解释和可信赖的自动驾驶提供了一条有前景的数据高效路径。

Abstract: Accurate short-horizon trajectory prediction is pivotal for safe and reliable
autonomous driving, yet existing vision-language models (VLMs) often fail to
effectively ground their reasoning in scene dynamics and domain knowledge. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces KEPT, a knowledge-enhanced VLM
framework that predicts ego trajectories directly from consecutive front-view
driving frames. KEPT couples a temporal frequency-spatial fusion (TFSF) video
encoder, trained via self-supervised learning with hard-negative mining, with a
scalable k-means + HNSW retrieval stack that supplies scene-aligned exemplars.
Retrieved priors are embedded into chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts with explicit
planning constraints, while a triple-stage fine-tuning schedule incrementally
aligns the language head to metric spatial cues, physically feasible motion,
and temporally conditioned front-view planning. Evaluated on nuScenes dataset,
KEPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across open-loop protocols: under
NoAvg, it achieves 0.70m average L2 with a 0.21\% collision rate; under TemAvg
with lightweight ego status, it attains 0.31m average L2 and a 0.07\% collision
rate. Ablation studies show that all three fine-tuning stages contribute
complementary benefits, and that using Top-2 retrieved exemplars yields the
best accuracy-safety trade-off. The k-means-clustered HNSW index delivers
sub-millisecond retrieval latency, supporting practical deployment. These
results indicate that retrieval-augmented, CoT-guided VLMs offer a promising,
data-efficient pathway toward interpretable and trustworthy autonomous driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstaDA是一个无需训练的双智能体系统，通过文本智能体和图像智能体协同工作，增强实例分割数据集的质量和多样性，在LVIS 1.0验证集上取得了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实例分割数据标注成本高、类别不平衡的问题，现有方法缺乏大语言模型与扩散模型的深度协作，未能充分利用现有训练数据的丰富信息。

Method: 提出双智能体系统：1) 文本智能体(T-Agent)通过Prompt Rethink机制迭代优化提示词，促进LLM与扩散模型协作；2) 图像智能体(I-Agent)基于训练图像生成新实例，丰富数据分布。两个智能体作为独立自动化工作流运行。

Conclusion: InstaDA通过双智能体架构有效解决了实例分割数据增强问题，实现了LLM与扩散模型的深度协作，显著提升了模型性能，且具有实用性和高效性。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality instance segmentation data is challenging due to the
labor-intensive nature of the annotation process and significant class
imbalances within datasets. Recent studies have utilized the integration of
Copy-Paste and diffusion models to create more diverse datasets. However, these
studies often lack deep collaboration between large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, and underutilize the rich information within the existing
training data. To address these limitations, we propose InstaDA, a novel,
training-free Dual-Agent system designed to augment instance segmentation
datasets. First, we introduce a Text-Agent (T-Agent) that enhances data
diversity through collaboration between LLMs and diffusion models. This agent
features a novel Prompt Rethink mechanism, which iteratively refines prompts
based on the generated images. This process not only fosters collaboration but
also increases image utilization and optimizes the prompts themselves.
Additionally, we present an Image-Agent (I-Agent) aimed at enriching the
overall data distribution. This agent augments the training set by generating
new instances conditioned on the training images. To ensure practicality and
efficiency, both agents operate as independent and automated workflows,
enhancing usability. Experiments conducted on the LVIS 1.0 validation set
indicate that InstaDA achieves significant improvements, with an increase of
+4.0 in box average precision (AP) and +3.3 in mask AP compared to the
baseline. Furthermore, it outperforms the leading model, DiverGen, by +0.3 in
box AP and +0.1 in mask AP, with a notable +0.7 gain in box AP on common
categories and mask AP gains of +0.2 on common categories and +0.5 on frequent
categories.

Motivation: 现有基于原型的方法通常为支持图像生成单一全局原型来匹配查询图像，忽略了类内变化，且当支持图像和查询图像存在较大差异时，局部原型可能不利于匹配

Method: 提出SPENet网络，包含多级原型生成模块（同时生成全局原型和自适应数量的局部原型）和查询引导的局部原型增强模块（根据查询图像指导自适应优化支持原型）

Result: 在三个公共医学数据集上的大量实验表明，SPENet优于现有最先进方法，实现了优越性能

Conclusion: SPENet通过多粒度原型匹配和查询引导的原型增强，有效解决了少样本医学图像分割中的类内变化和图像差异问题

Abstract: Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation (FSMIS) aims to segment novel classes of
medical objects using only a few labeled images. Prototype-based methods have
made significant progress in addressing FSMIS. However, they typically generate
a single global prototype for the support image to match with the query image,
overlooking intra-class variations. To address this issue, we propose a
Self-guided Prototype Enhancement Network (SPENet). Specifically, we introduce
a Multi-level Prototype Generation (MPG) module, which enables
multi-granularity measurement between the support and query images by
simultaneously generating a global prototype and an adaptive number of local
prototypes. Additionally, we observe that not all local prototypes in the
support image are beneficial for matching, especially when there are
substantial discrepancies between the support and query images. To alleviate
this issue, we propose a Query-guided Local Prototype Enhancement (QLPE)
module, which adaptively refines support prototypes by incorporating guidance
from the query image, thus mitigating the negative effects of such
discrepancies. Extensive experiments on three public medical datasets
demonstrate that SPENet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods,
achieving superior performance.

Motivation: 遥感图像中小物体分割在城市规划、环境监测等领域具有重要价值，但目前缺乏专门的实例分割数据集和有效方法。SAM模型虽然有零样本适应能力，但在小物体分割上性能差，主要因为1/16的粗糕特征分辨率导致细节信息丢失。

Method: 提出SOPSeg框架：1)区域适应放大策略保持细粒度细节；2)自定义解码器集成边缘预测和渐进精细化；3)针对遥感应用中常用的方向盒设计了新的提示机制。

Result: SOPSeg在小物体分割任务上超过了现有方法，能够支持高效的遥感数据集构建。还基于SODA-A构建了一个全面的小物体实例分割数据集。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了遥感小物体实例分割的研究空白，SOPSeg框架提供了有效的解决方案，并将释放模型和数据集以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Extracting small objects from remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in
various applications, including urban planning, environmental monitoring, and
disaster management. While current research primarily focuses on small object
detection, instance segmentation for small objects remains underexplored, with
no dedicated datasets available. This gap stems from the technical challenges
and high costs of pixel-level annotation for small objects. While the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates impressive zero-shot generalization, its
performance on small-object segmentation deteriorates significantly, largely
due to the coarse 1/16 feature resolution that causes severe loss of fine
spatial details. To this end, we propose SOPSeg, a prompt-based framework
specifically designed for small object segmentation in remote sensing imagery.
It incorporates a region-adaptive magnification strategy to preserve
fine-grained details, and employs a customized decoder that integrates edge
prediction and progressive refinement for accurate boundary delineation.
Moreover, we introduce a novel prompting mechanism tailored to the oriented
bounding boxes widely adopted in remote sensing applications. SOPSeg
outperforms existing methods in small object segmentation and facilitates
efficient dataset construction for remote sensing tasks. We further construct a
comprehensive small object instance segmentation dataset based on SODA-A, and
will release both the model and dataset to support future research.

Abstract: Recent studies on deep watermarking have predominantly focused on
in-processing watermarking, which integrates the watermarking process into
image generation. However, post-processing watermarking, which embeds
watermarks after image generation, offers more flexibility. It can be applied
to outputs from any generative model (e.g. GANs, diffusion models) without
needing access to the model's internal structure. It also allows users to embed
unique watermarks into individual images. Therefore, this study focuses on
post-processing watermarking and enhances its robustness by incorporating an
ensemble attack network during training. We construct various versions of
attack networks using CNN and Transformer in both spatial and frequency domains
to investigate how each combination influences the robustness of the
watermarking model. Our results demonstrate that combining a CNN-based attack
network in the spatial domain with a Transformer-based attack network in the
frequency domain yields the highest robustness in watermarking models.
Extensive evaluation on the WAVES benchmark, using average bit accuracy as the
metric, demonstrates that our ensemble attack network significantly enhances
the robustness of baseline watermarking methods under various stress tests. In
particular, for the Regeneration Attack defined in WAVES, our method improves
StegaStamp by 18.743%. The code is released

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在处理视觉和文本输入时，经常错误地将文本输入中缺乏视觉证据的概念误认为是图像的一部分，导致生成错误响应。

Method: 识别出特定的Feed-Forward Network(FFN)神经元(VA神经元)，利用其激活模式开发检测模块来分类输入token是否在视觉上被支持，并基于此重新解释问题提示或在生成过程中替换检测到的缺失token。

Result: 实验表明该方法有效缓解了模型错误假定文本输入在视觉上存在的倾向，且在不同LVLMs上具有通用性。

Conclusion: 通过识别和利用VA神经元的激活模式，可以系统性地检测文本概念的视觉基础性，从而显著改善LVLMs的响应准确性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) generate contextually relevant responses
by jointly interpreting visual and textual inputs. However, our finding reveals
they often mistakenly perceive text inputs lacking visual evidence as being
part of the image, leading to erroneous responses. In light of this finding, we
probe whether LVLMs possess an internal capability to determine if textual
concepts are grounded in the image, and discover a specific subset of
Feed-Forward Network (FFN) neurons, termed Visual Absence-aware (VA) neurons,
that consistently signal the visual absence through a distinctive activation
pattern. Leveraging these patterns, we develop a detection module that
systematically classifies whether an input token is visually grounded. Guided
by its prediction, we propose a method to refine the outputs by reinterpreting
question prompts or replacing the detected absent tokens during generation.
Extensive experiments show that our method effectively mitigates the models'
tendency to falsely presume the visual presence of text input and its
generality across various LVLMs.

Conclusion: 背景语义在人员重识别中与前景语义同样重要，通过合理利用背景信息可以提升模型的识别能力，为复杂场景下的人员重识别提供了新的解决思路

Abstract: Person re-identification faces two core challenges: precisely locating the
foreground target while suppressing background noise and extracting
fine-grained features from the target region. Numerous visual-only approaches
address these issues by partitioning an image and applying attention modules,
yet they rely on costly manual annotations and struggle with complex
occlusions. Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic
cues to guide visual understanding. However, they focus solely on foreground
information, but overlook the potential value of background cues. Inspired by
human perception, we argue that background semantics are as important as the
foreground semantics in ReID, as humans tend to eliminate background
distractions while focusing on target appearance. Therefore, this paper
proposes an end-to-end framework that jointly models foreground and background
information within a dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction pipeline. To
help the network distinguish between the two domains, we propose an
intra-semantic alignment and inter-semantic adversarial learning strategy.
Specifically, we align visual and textual features that share the same
semantics across domains, while simultaneously penalizing similarity between
foreground and background features to enhance the network's discriminative
power. This strategy drives the model to actively suppress noisy background
regions and enhance attention toward identity-relevant foreground cues.
Comprehensive experiments on two holistic and two occluded ReID benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method, with
results that match or surpass those of current state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Accurate skin-lesion segmentation remains a key technical challenge for

extraction and multi-scale context aggregation. The encoder stacks depth-wise
Mobile Inverted Bottleneck blocks to curb computation, inserts a

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决不良多任务问题，动态条件设计显著提升了网络学习效果。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have made impressive progress in the field of
image processing, but the characteristics of constructing data distribution
pathways make it difficult to exploit the intrinsic correlation between tasks
in multi-task scenarios, which is even worse in ill-posed tasks with a lack of
training data. In addition, traditional static condition control makes it
difficult for networks to learn in multi-task scenarios with its dynamically
evolving characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic
conditional double diffusion bridge training paradigm to build a general
framework for ill-posed multi-tasks. Firstly, this paradigm decouples the
diffusion and condition generation processes, avoiding the dependence of the
diffusion model on supervised data in ill-posed tasks. Secondly, generated by
the same noise schedule, dynamic conditions are used to gradually adjust their
statistical characteristics, naturally embed time-related information, and
reduce the difficulty of network learning. We analyze the learning objectives
of the network under different conditional forms in the single-step denoising
process and compare the changes in its attention weights in the network,
demonstrating the superiority of our dynamic conditions. Taking dehazing and
visible-infrared fusion as typical ill-posed multi-task scenarios, we achieve
the best performance in multiple indicators on public datasets. The code has

classify highly cursive and complex characters. The generator network produces
fake handwritten character images, which are then used to augment the training

score above a threshold with the discriminator network. The results show that
the accuracy of convolutional neural networks decreases as character complexity
increases, but our proposed model, ADA-GAN, remains more robust and effective
for both cursive and complex characters.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms pose a significant clinical risk yet are difficult to
detect, delineate and model due to limited annotated 3D data. We propose a
cross-domain feature-transfer approach that leverages the latent geometric
embeddings learned by TRELLIS, a generative model trained on large-scale
non-medical 3D datasets, to augment neural networks for aneurysm analysis. By
replacing conventional point normals or mesh descriptors with TRELLIS surface
features, we systematically enhance three downstream tasks: (i) classifying
aneurysms versus healthy vessels in the Intra3D dataset, (ii) segmenting
aneurysm and vessel regions on 3D meshes, and (iii) predicting time-evolving
blood-flow fields using a graph neural network on the AnXplore dataset. Our
experiments show that the inclusion of these features yields strong gains in
accuracy, F1-score and segmentation quality over state-of-the-art baselines,
and reduces simulation error by 15\%. These results illustrate the broader
potential of transferring 3D representations from general-purpose generative
models to specialized medical tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法展示了人脸反欺骗检测中后门投毒的潜在威胁，证明了特定欺骗攻击可以成功绕过检测系统。

Abstract: Face recognition systems are robust against environmental changes and noise,
and thus may be vulnerable to illegal authentication attempts using user face
photos, such as spoofing attacks. To prevent such spoofing attacks, it is
crucial to discriminate whether the input image is a live user image or a
spoofed image prior to the face recognition process. Most existing spoofing
attack detection methods utilize deep learning, which necessitates a
substantial amount of training data. Consequently, if malicious data is
injected into a portion of the training dataset, a specific spoofing attack may
be erroneously classified as live, leading to false positives.In this paper, we
propose a novel backdoor poisoning attack method to demonstrate the latent
threat of backdoor poisoning within face anti-spoofing detection. The proposed
method enables certain spoofing attacks to bypass detection by embedding
features extracted from the spoofing attack's face image into a live face image
without inducing any perceptible visual alterations.Through experiments
conducted on public datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method
constitutes a realistic threat to existing spoofing attack detection systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于梯度自反思的token影响估计方法，通过影响感知对比解码框架同时缓解多模态大语言模型中的文本-视觉偏差和共现偏差，无需额外资源即可有效减少幻觉现象


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法启发式地处理多模态大语言模型中的文本-视觉偏差和共现偏差，但未能理解不同实例间波动变化的偏差水平，需要更精准的偏差检测和缓解方法

Method: 1) 使用基于梯度的自反思方法估计不同类型token（视觉、提示、先前输出）的影响；2) 检测与对象相关的视觉token；3) 将估计的token影响整合到影响感知对比解码框架中

Result: 在LLaVA-QA90上实现了高达92%的准确率提升，有效减少了幻觉现象

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不依赖额外资源（如昂贵微调、额外模型或数据统计）的情况下，同时缓解文本-视觉偏差和共现偏差，显著提升多模态大语言模型的准确性

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language model are caused by the
text-visual bias and the co-occurrence bias. The former reflects an
over-reliance on text information in the decision-making process, while the
latter arises from the statistical object-pairing patterns abstracted from the
training data. Existing mitigation methods heuristically address these biases
without understanding the fluctuating bias level across the instances. We first
propose estimating the influence of respective token types (visual, prompt, and
previous outputs) using a gradient-based self-reflection method. The estimated
token influence further enables the detection of object-related visual tokens
and their integration into an influence-aware contrastive decoding framework to
mitigate both types of biases simultaneously. Our method operates without the
need for additional resources, such as costly fine-tuning, extra models, or
data statistics. Extensive experiments show it effectively reduces
hallucinations, achieving up to a 92% accuracy increase on LLaVA-QA90.

TL;DR: CAIM-Net是一个时间序列变化检测网络，通过从变化时刻推断变化区域，确保变化区域和变化时刻结果的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法将变化区域检测和变化时刻识别作为独立任务处理，但变化区域可以从变化时刻推断出来，因此需要确保两者结果的一致性。

Method: CAIM-Net包含三个关键步骤：差异提取与增强、粗粒度变化时刻提取、细粒度变化时刻提取与变化区域推断。使用轻量级编码器提取差异特征，通过边界增强卷积放大特征，进行时空相关性分析，最后使用多尺度时间CAM模块推断变化区域。

Result: 该方法能够同时指示变化发生的位置和时间，确保变化区域和变化时刻检测结果的一致性。

Conclusion: CAIM-Net通过从变化时刻推断变化区域的新方法，解决了时间序列变化检测中变化区域和变化时刻结果不一致的问题，为生态系统动态监测提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Time series change detection is a critical task for exploring ecosystem
dynamics using time series remote sensing images, because it can simultaneously
indicate where and when change occur. While deep learning has shown excellent
performance in this domain, it continues to approach change area detection and
change moment identification as distinct tasks. Given that change area can be
inferred from change moment, we propose a time series change detection network,
named CAIM-Net (Change Area Inference from Moment Network), to ensure
consistency between change area and change moment results. CAIM-Net infers
change area from change moment based on the intrinsic relationship between time
series analysis and spatial change detection. The CAIM-Net comprises three key
steps: Difference Extraction and Enhancement, Coarse Change Moment Extraction,
and Fine Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference. In the Difference
Extraction and Enhancement, a lightweight encoder with batch dimension stacking
is designed to rapidly extract difference features. Subsequently, boundary
enhancement convolution is applied to amplify these difference features. In the
Coarse Change Moment Extraction, the enhanced difference features from the
first step are used to spatiotemporal correlation analysis, and then two
distinct methods are employed to determine coarse change moments. In the Fine
Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference, a multiscale temporal Class
Activation Mapping (CAM) module first increases the weight of the
change-occurring moment from coarse change moments. Then the weighted change
moment is used to infer change area based on the fact that pixels with the
change moment must have undergone a change.

Motivation: 现有手-物体姿态估计方法存在穿透、接触区域间隙问题，且难以捕捉手部在交互过程中的真实变形，需要更精细的交互建模方法。

Method: 将手-物体交互建模为引力场驱动过程，使用Gravity-Field Based Diffusion Bridge模拟可变形手部表面与刚性物体的交互，结合文本语义信息指导引力场构建。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效消除穿透、确保稳定抓握、捕捉真实手部变形，生成物理合理的交互效果。

Conclusion: GravityDB方法通过引力场扩散桥成功解决了手-物体交互中的关键挑战，为精细交互建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing reconstruction or hand-object pose estimation methods are capable of
producing coarse interaction states. However, due to the complex and diverse
geometry of both human hands and objects, these approaches often suffer from
interpenetration or leave noticeable gaps in regions that are supposed to be in
contact. Moreover, the surface of a real human hand undergoes non-negligible
deformations during interaction, which are difficult to capture and represent
with previous methods. To tackle these challenges, we formulate hand-object
interaction as an attraction-driven process and propose a Gravity-Field Based
Diffusion Bridge (GravityDB) to simulate interactions between a deformable hand
surface and rigid objects. Our approach effectively resolves the aforementioned
issues by generating physically plausible interactions that are free of
interpenetration, ensure stable grasping, and capture realistic hand
deformations. Furthermore, we incorporate semantic information from textual
descriptions to guide the construction of the gravitational field, enabling
more semantically meaningful interaction regions. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：无法明确捕捉结构变化与时间间隔的关系、仅依赖扫描插值缺乏临床实用性、多数基于2D架构忽视3D解剖上下文。需要更准确的脑部疾病进展预测工具

Method: 使用预训练的脑龄估计器(BAE)指导扩散模型生成反映预期年龄差异的MRI；提出Back-In-Time正则化(BITR)，通过双向训练(前向和后向)提高时间准确性

Result: 在OASIS-3数据集上训练和评估，并在NACC数据集外部测试集上验证泛化性能

Conclusion: TADM-3D能够准确预测脑部MRI的进展，通过时间感知机制和双向正则化提高了预测的时间准确性

Abstract: Generating realistic MRIs to accurately predict future changes in the
structure of brain is an invaluable tool for clinicians in assessing clinical
outcomes and analysing the disease progression at the patient level. However,
current existing methods present some limitations: (i) some approaches fail to
explicitly capture the relationship between structural changes and time
intervals, especially when trained on age-imbalanced datasets; (ii) others rely
only on scan interpolation, which lack clinical utility, as they generate
intermediate images between timepoints rather than future pathological
progression; and (iii) most approaches rely on 2D slice-based architectures,
thereby disregarding full 3D anatomical context, which is essential for
accurate longitudinal predictions. We propose a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion
Model (TADM-3D), which accurately predicts brain progression on MRI volumes. To
better model the relationship between time interval and brain changes, TADM-3D
uses a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) that guides the diffusion model in
the generation of MRIs that accurately reflect the expected age difference
between baseline and generated follow-up scans. Additionally, to further
improve the temporal awareness of TADM-3D, we propose the Back-In-Time
Regularisation (BITR), by training TADM-3D to predict bidirectionally from the
baseline to follow-up (forward), as well as from the follow-up to baseline
(backward). Although predicting past scans has limited clinical applications,
this regularisation helps the model generate temporally more accurate scans. We
train and evaluate TADM-3D on the OASIS-3 dataset, and we validate the
generalisation performance on an external test set from the NACC dataset. The
code will be available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了两种新颖的损失函数（负中心线损失和简化拓扑损失）来保持生物医学分割中细长结构的连续性，特别适用于信号丢失严重的轴突起始段分割任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生物医学分割任务中，细长结构的连续性和长度保持比体素级精度更重要。现有方法在处理信号丢失时容易产生不连续分割。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络，结合新提出的负中心线损失和简化拓扑损失函数，并采用下采样和间距校正等实验设计策略。

Result: 与标准CNN和现有拓扑感知损失相比，新方法显著减少了每个实例的分割不连续性，特别是在输入信号缺失区域，改善了实例长度计算的准确性。

Conclusion: 在损失函数设计中嵌入结构先验可以显著提高生物应用分割的可靠性，特别是在保持细长结构连续性方面。

Abstract: In many biomedical segmentation tasks, the preservation of elongated
structure continuity and length is more important than voxel-wise accuracy. We
propose two novel loss functions, Negative Centerline Loss and Simplified
Topology Loss, that, applied to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), help
preserve connectivity of output instances. Moreover, we discuss characteristics
of experiment design, such as downscaling and spacing correction, that help
obtain continuous segmentation masks. We evaluate our approach on a 3D
light-sheet fluorescence microscopy dataset of axon initial segments (AIS), a
task prone to discontinuity due to signal dropout. Compared to standard CNNs
and existing topology-aware losses, our methods reduce the number of
segmentation discontinuities per instance, particularly in regions with missing
input signal, resulting in improved instance length calculation in downstream
applications. Our findings demonstrate that structural priors embedded in the
loss design can significantly enhance the reliability of segmentation for
biological applications.

Conclusion: Count2Density能够仅使用计数级标注有效预测包含定量空间信息的有意义密度图，验证了管道中各个组件的有效性，为减少标注负担提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: Crowd density estimation is a well-known computer vision task aimed at
estimating the density distribution of people in an image. The main challenge
in this domain is the reliance on fine-grained location-level annotations,
(i.e. points placed on top of each individual) to train deep networks.
Collecting such detailed annotations is both tedious, time-consuming, and poses
a significant barrier to scalability for real-world applications. To alleviate
this burden, we present Count2Density: a novel pipeline designed to predict
meaningful density maps containing quantitative spatial information using only
count-level annotations (i.e., total number of people) during training. To
achieve this, Count2Density generates pseudo-density maps leveraging past
predictions stored in a Historical Map Bank, thereby reducing confirmation
bias. This bank is initialised using an unsupervised saliency estimator to
provide an initial spatial prior and is iteratively updated with an EMA of
predicted density maps. These pseudo-density maps are obtained by sampling
locations from estimated crowd areas using a hypergeometric distribution, with
the number of samplings determined by the count-level annotations. To further
enhance the spatial awareness of the model, we add a self-supervised
contrastive spatial regulariser to encourage similar feature representations
within crowded regions while maximising dissimilarity with background regions.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
cross-domain adaptation methods and achieves better results than recent
state-of-the-art approaches in semi-supervised settings across several
datasets. Additional analyses validate the effectiveness of each individual
component of our pipeline, confirming the ability of Count2Density to
effectively retrieve spatial information from count-level annotations and
enabling accurate subregion counting.

Conclusion: 军事领域需要大型代表性数据集来进一步评估投毒攻击风险和补丁检测机会；AutoDetect方法为投毒检测提供了简单、快速、轻量级的解决方案。

Abstract: Poisoning attacks pose an increasing threat to the security and robustness of
Artificial Intelligence systems in the military domain. The widespread use of
open-source datasets and pretrained models exacerbates this risk. Despite the
severity of this threat, there is limited research on the application and
detection of poisoning attacks on object detection systems. This is especially
problematic in the military domain, where attacks can have grave consequences.
In this work, we both investigate the effect of poisoning attacks on military
object detectors in practice, and the best approach to detect these attacks. To
support this research, we create a small, custom dataset featuring military
vehicles: MilCivVeh. We explore the vulnerability of military object detectors
for poisoning attacks by implementing a modified version of the BadDet attack:
a patch-based poisoning attack. We then assess its impact, finding that while a
positive attack success rate is achievable, it requires a substantial portion
of the data to be poisoned -- raising questions about its practical
applicability. To address the detection challenge, we test both specialized
poisoning detection methods and anomaly detection methods from the visual
industrial inspection domain. Since our research shows that both classes of
methods are lacking, we introduce our own patch detection method: AutoDetect, a
simple, fast, and lightweight autoencoder-based method. Our method shows
promising results in separating clean from poisoned samples using the
reconstruction error of image slices, outperforming existing methods, while
being less time- and memory-intensive. We urge that the availability of large,
representative datasets in the military domain is a prerequisite to further
evaluate risks of poisoning attacks and opportunities patch detection.

Motivation: 低剂量CT虽然能减少辐射暴露，但会导致噪声增加和图像质量下降。传统去噪方法在保持图像质量方面存在不足，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 使用基于强化学习的方法，采用先进的PPO算法实时优化去噪策略，通过自定义gym环境进行训练，结合编码器-解码器架构。

Conclusion: 该方法为低剂量CT成像提供了更安全、更准确的解决方案，在图像质量和临床应用方面都显示出显著优势。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is critical for minimizing radiation
exposure, but it often leads to increased noise and reduced image quality.
Traditional denoising methods, such as iterative optimization or supervised
learning, often fail to preserve image quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce PPORLD-EDNetLDCT, a reinforcement learning-based (RL) approach with
Encoder-Decoder for LDCT. Our method utilizes a dynamic RL-based approach in
which an advanced posterior policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is used to
optimize denoising policies in real time, based on image quality feedback,
trained via a custom gym environment. The experimental results on the low dose
CT image and projection dataset demonstrate that the proposed PPORLD-EDNetLDCT
model outperforms traditional denoising techniques and other DL-based methods,
achieving a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 41.87, a structural similarity index
measure of 0.9814 and a root mean squared error of 0.00236. Moreover, in
NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Challenge dataset our method achived a PSNR of
41.52, SSIM of 0.9723 and RMSE of 0.0051. Furthermore, we validated the quality
of denoising using a classification task in the COVID-19 LDCT dataset, where
the images processed by our method improved the classification accuracy to
94\%, achieving 4\% higher accuracy compared to denoising without RL-based
denoising. This method offers a promising solution for safer and more accurate
LDCT imaging.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved
natural language understanding and generation, enhancing Human-Computer

lack the ability to interpret emotional cues from non-verbal signals, hindering
more immersive and empathetic interactions. This work explores integrating
multimodal sentiment perception into LLMs to create emotion-aware agents. We
propose \ours, an AI-based virtual companion that captures multimodal sentiment
cues, enabling emotionally aligned and animated HCI. \ours introduces a
Multimodal Sentiment Perception Network (MSPN) using a cross-modal fusion
transformer and supervised contrastive learning to provide emotional cues.
Additionally, we develop an emotion-aware prompt engineering strategy for
generating empathetic responses and integrate a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system and
animated avatar module for expressive interactions. \ours provides a framework
for emotion-aware agents with applications in companion robotics, social care,
mental health, and human-centered AI.

Conclusion: RTGMFF通过结合文本生成和多模态特征融合，有效解决了fMRI诊断中的关键挑战，为脑部疾病诊断提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful tool for probing
brain function, yet reliable clinical diagnosis is hampered by low
signal-to-noise ratios, inter-subject variability, and the limited frequency
awareness of prevailing CNN- and Transformer-based models. Moreover, most fMRI
datasets lack textual annotations that could contextualize regional activation
and connectivity patterns. We introduce RTGMFF, a framework that unifies
automatic ROI-level text generation with multimodal feature fusion for
brain-disorder diagnosis. RTGMFF consists of three components: (i) ROI-driven
fMRI text generation deterministically condenses each subject's activation,
connectivity, age, and sex into reproducible text tokens; (ii) Hybrid
frequency-spatial encoder fuses a hierarchical wavelet-mamba branch with a
cross-scale Transformer encoder to capture frequency-domain structure alongside
long-range spatial dependencies; and (iii) Adaptive semantic alignment module
embeds the ROI token sequence and visual features in a shared space, using a
regularized cosine-similarity loss to narrow the modality gap. Extensive
experiments on the ADHD-200 and ABIDE benchmarks show that RTGMFF surpasses
current methods in diagnostic accuracy, achieving notable gains in sensitivity,
specificity, and area under the ROC curve. Code is available at

parametric curve instances from raw point clouds, avoiding the intermediate
representations and multi-stage processing common in prior work. Extending
3DETR, our model introduces a geometry-aware matching strategy and specialized
loss functions that enable unified detection of differently parameterized curve
types, including cubic B\'ezier curves, line segments, circles, and arcs, in a
single forward pass. Optional post-processing steps further refine predictions
without adding complexity. This streamlined design improves robustness to noise
and varying sampling densities, addressing critical challenges in real world
LiDAR and 3D sensing scenarios. PI3DETR sets a new state-of-the-art on the ABC
dataset and generalizes effectively to real sensor data, offering a simple yet
powerful solution for 3D edge and curve estimation.

TL;DR: 提出SynBT模型，使用3D扩散模型生成高质量乳腺肿瘤MRI图像，通过patch-to-volume自编码器和掩码条件扩散模型实现大视野下的肿瘤合成，提升分割性能2-3% Dice分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有肿瘤合成方法在大空间体积（如乳腺MRI大视野）中表现不佳，而常用方法基于小patch，需要高质量大视野肿瘤合成技术来提升分割模型性能。

Method: 提出SynBT 3D医学扩散模型，包含patch-to-volume自编码器压缩高分辨率MRI到紧凑潜在空间，保持大视野分辨率；使用掩码条件扩散模型在选定乳腺组织区域合成肿瘤。

Result: 在大型公共数据集上评估，该方法可使常见分割模型性能提升2-3% Dice分数，证明高质量肿瘤合成对MRI图像肿瘤分割有益。

Conclusion: SynBT模型能够生成高质量的乳腺肿瘤MRI图像，有效提升肿瘤分割性能，为医学图像分析提供了有价值的合成数据生成解决方案。

Abstract: Synthetic tumors in medical images offer controllable characteristics that
facilitate the training of machine learning models, leading to an improved
segmentation performance. However, the existing methods of tumor synthesis
yield suboptimal performances when tumor occupies a large spatial volume, such
as breast tumor segmentation in MRI with a large field-of-view (FOV), while
commonly used tumor generation methods are based on small patches. In this
paper, we propose a 3D medical diffusion model, called SynBT, to generate
high-quality breast tumor (BT) in contrast-enhanced MRI images. The proposed
model consists of a patch-to-volume autoencoder, which is able to compress the
high-resolution MRIs into compact latent space, while preserving the resolution
of volumes with large FOV. Using the obtained latent space feature vector, a
mask-conditioned diffusion model is used to synthesize breast tumors within
selected regions of breast tissue, resulting in realistic tumor appearances. We
evaluated the proposed method for a tumor segmentation task, which demonstrated
the proposed high-quality tumor synthesis method can facilitate the common
segmentation models with performance improvement of 2-3% Dice Score on a large
public dataset, and therefore provides benefits for tumor segmentation in MRI
images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointAD+是一个统一的3D异常检测框架，通过结合隐式渲染表示和显式空间表示，将CLIP的2D泛化能力迁移到3D异常检测中，在未见过的多样化类别对象上实现了优异的零样本检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将CLIP强大的2D泛化能力迁移到3D异常检测领域，以识别具有高度多样化类别语义的未见对象的3D异常。

Method: 提出PointAD+框架：1) 设计PointAD利用点-像素对应关系进行隐式3D表示；2) 引入显式3D表示强调空间异常关系；3) 使用G-aggregation聚合几何信息；4) 分层表示学习结合渲染和几何提示；5) 跨层次对比对齐促进层间交互。

Result: 大量实验证明PointAD+在零样本3D异常检测方面具有优越性，能够对具有高度多样化类别语义的未见对象实现异常的整体理解。

Conclusion: PointAD+通过统一隐式和显式3D异常表示，成功将CLIP的2D能力迁移到3D领域，实现了对3D异常的全面检测和分割，支持即插即用的RGB信息集成以进一步提升性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to transfer CLIP's robust 2D generalization
capabilities to identify 3D anomalies across unseen objects of highly diverse
class semantics. To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively
detect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level
information. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel
correspondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering
pixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D
representation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects
the inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose
PointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing
explicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal
spatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry
information to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To
simultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes
hierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit
anomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the
rendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy
contrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between
the rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning.
Finally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the
generalized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB
information in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in
ZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class
semantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.

Motivation: 探索验证奖励的强化学习在少于70亿参数的轻量级多模态语言模型中的有效性，以及长思维链数据对其推理能力的作用

Method: 使用长思维链数据进行监督微调(SFT)，随后进行强化学习(RL)阶段

Result: 长思维链数据的SFT显著提升MLLM推理能力，后续RL阶段能带来额外性能增益

Conclusion: 长思维链数据的SFT阶段是开发轻量级MLLM推理能力的关键前提条件

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has enhanced the
reasoning of large-scale language models (LLMs), its efficacy for lightweight
multimodal language models (MLLMs) with fewer than seven billion parameters
remains underexplored. This paper investigates the role of long
Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) data in enhancing the reasoning abilities of such
MLLMs. Our findings demonstrate that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with long CoT
data significantly improves MLLM reasoning. Furthermore, we observe that after
this initial SFT phase, MLLMs can achieve additional performance gains through
a subsequent RL stage. We conclude that a SFT stage with long CoT data is a
critical prerequisite for developing the reasoning capabilities of lightweight
MLLMs.

Motivation: 星形胶质细胞是重要的胶质细胞，其形态和密度变化是许多神经系统疾病的标志，但由于其复杂的分支结构和染色依赖性变异，自动化检测极具挑战性。

Method: 采用混合CNN-Transformer检测器，结合局部特征提取和全局上下文推理。使用热图引导的查询机制生成空间锚点以检测小而模糊的星形胶质细胞，轻量级Transformer模块改善密集簇中的区分能力。

Result: 在ALDH1L1和GFAP染色星形胶质细胞数据集上，该模型始终优于Faster R-CNN、YOLOv11和DETR，实现了更高的敏感性和更少的假阳性，FROC分析证实了这一点。

Conclusion: 混合CNN-Transformer架构在稳健的星形胶质细胞检测方面具有巨大潜力，为先进的计算机病理学工具奠定了基础。

Abstract: Astrocytes are critical glial cells whose altered morphology and density are
hallmarks of many neurological disorders. However, their intricate branching
and stain dependent variability make automated detection of histological images
a highly challenging task. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid CNN
Transformer detector that combines local feature extraction with global
contextual reasoning. A heatmap guided query mechanism generates spatially
grounded anchors for small and faint astrocytes, while a lightweight
Transformer module improves discrimination in dense clusters. Evaluated on
ALDH1L1 and GFAP stained astrocyte datasets, the model consistently
outperformed Faster R-CNN, YOLOv11 and DETR, achieving higher sensitivity with
fewer false positives, as confirmed by FROC analysis. These results highlight
the potential of hybrid CNN Transformer architectures for robust astrocyte
detection and provide a foundation for advanced computational pathology tools.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfraDiffusion是一个零样本框架，通过虚拟相机将砖石点云转换为深度图，并使用DDNM进行恢复，无需特定任务训练即可提升深度图的视觉清晰度和几何一致性，显著改善了砖块级分割效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低光照环境下获取高分辨率RGB图像不切实际，而点云虽然对暗光环境鲁棒，但通常是非结构化、稀疏且嘈杂的，限制了细粒度分割能力

Method: 使用虚拟相机将砖石点云投影为深度图，采用Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model (DDNM)进行恢复，结合Segment Anything Model (SAM)进行砖块级分割

Result: 在砖石桥梁和隧道点云数据集上的实验显示，砖块级分割性能显著提升

Conclusion: InfraDiffusion框架展示了在砖石资产自动化检测方面的潜力，特别是在低光照环境下

Abstract: Point clouds are widely used for infrastructure monitoring by providing
geometric information, where segmentation is required for downstream tasks such
as defect detection. Existing research has automated semantic segmentation of
structural components, while brick-level segmentation (identifying defects such
as spalling and mortar loss) has been primarily conducted from RGB images.
However, acquiring high-resolution images is impractical in low-light
environments like masonry tunnels. Point clouds, though robust to dim lighting,
are typically unstructured, sparse, and noisy, limiting fine-grained
segmentation. We present InfraDiffusion, a zero-shot framework that projects
masonry point clouds into depth maps using virtual cameras and restores them by
adapting the Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model (DDNM). Without task-specific
training, InfraDiffusion enhances visual clarity and geometric consistency of
depth maps. Experiments on masonry bridge and tunnel point cloud datasets show
significant improvements in brick-level segmentation using the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), underscoring its potential for automated inspection of masonry
assets. Our code and data is available at

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法难以同时表征全局依赖和局部一致性，无法兼顾长程交互和边界细节的保持。

Method: 使用Transformer捕获全局依赖，引入内容自适应图神经网络增强局部关系，集成多传播阶数动态学习图结构，采用图残差机制保持全局信息并稳定训练。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在性能上优于最先进的现有方法。

Conclusion: T-CAGU框架通过Transformer和图神经网络的结合，有效解决了高光谱解混中全局和局部特征同时保持的挑战，具有鲁棒性和优越性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) targets to decompose each mixed pixel in remote
sensing images into a set of endmembers and their corresponding abundances.
Despite significant progress in this field using deep learning, most methods
fail to simultaneously characterize global dependencies and local consistency,
making it difficult to preserve both long-range interactions and boundary
details. This letter proposes a novel transformer-guided content-adaptive graph
unmixing framework (T-CAGU), which overcomes these challenges by employing a
transformer to capture global dependencies and introducing a content-adaptive
graph neural network to enhance local relationships. Unlike previous work,
T-CAGU integrates multiple propagation orders to dynamically learn the graph
structure, ensuring robustness against noise. Furthermore, T-CAGU leverages a
graph residual mechanism to preserve global information and stabilize training.
Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/T-CAGU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在图像分类中表现优异但计算成本高昂，需要在不损失精度的情况下降低大ViT模型的推理成本

Method: 使用轻量级视觉模型在推理时估计token重要性，选择性丢弃低重要性token，无需修改架构且兼容各种ViT模型

Result: 在标准图像分类基准测试中，FLOPs减少高达80%，精度退化极小

Conclusion: 该框架具有出色的泛化能力和实际应用价值，可用于高效的ViT分类

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve strong performance in image classification
but incur high computational costs from processing all image tokens. To reduce
inference costs in large ViTs without compromising accuracy, we propose
TinyDrop, a training-free token dropping framework guided by a lightweight
vision model. The guidance model estimates the importance of tokens while
performing inference, thereby selectively discarding low-importance tokens if
large vit models need to perform attention calculations. The framework operates
plug-and-play, requires no architectural modifications, and is compatible with
diverse ViT architectures. Evaluations on standard image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that our framework reduces FLOPs by up to 80% for ViTs
with minimal accuracy degradation, highlighting its generalization capability
and practical utility for efficient ViT-based classification.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标在概念定制评估中存在过于窄或过于广泛的问题，导致与人类偏好不一致

Method: 提出分解式GPT评分方法(D-GPTScore)，将评估标准分解为更细层面的方面，并使用多模态大语言模型进行方面评估

Result: 方法在CC-AlignBench标准数据集上显著超过现有方法，与人类偏好具有更高的相关性

Conclusion: 本研究为概念定制评估建立了新标准，并指出了未来研究的关键挑战

Abstract: Evaluating concept customization is challenging, as it requires a
comprehensive assessment of fidelity to generative prompts and concept images.
Moreover, evaluating multiple concepts is considerably more difficult than
evaluating a single concept, as it demands detailed assessment not only for
each individual concept but also for the interactions among concepts. While
humans can intuitively assess generated images, existing metrics often provide
either overly narrow or overly generalized evaluations, resulting in
misalignment with human preference. To address this, we propose Decomposed GPT
Score (D-GPTScore), a novel human-aligned evaluation method that decomposes
evaluation criteria into finer aspects and incorporates aspect-wise assessments
using Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Additionally, we release Human
Preference-Aligned Concept Customization Benchmark (CC-AlignBench), a benchmark
dataset containing both single- and multi-concept tasks, enabling stage-wise
evaluation across a wide difficulty range -- from individual actions to
multi-person interactions. Our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches on this benchmark, exhibiting higher correlation with human
preferences. This work establishes a new standard for evaluating concept
customization and highlights key challenges for future research. The benchmark

Method: 提出了一个可扩展的松耦合多模态框架，能够无缝整合CNV、临床记录和组织病理图像。引入了全手片图像(WSI)的双重表征方法，结合传统图像基础和图象基础表征。还提出了新的多模态融合策略。

Result: 综合结果显示，将双重WSI表征与CNV和临床健康记录相结合，以及使用提出的管线和融合策略，在乳腺癌分型任务中超过了最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅在乳腺癌分型中表现优异，还具有良好的扩展性，能够轻松整合额外模态，无需重新训练现有模态，因此也适用于其他类型的癌症。

Abstract: Healthcare applications are inherently multimodal, benefiting greatly from
the integration of diverse data sources. However, the modalities available in
clinical settings can vary across different locations and patients. A key area
that stands to gain from multimodal integration is breast cancer molecular
subtyping, an important clinical task that can facilitate personalized
treatment and improve patient prognosis. In this work, we propose a scalable
and loosely-coupled multimodal framework that seamlessly integrates data from
various modalities, including copy number variation (CNV), clinical records,
and histopathology images, to enhance breast cancer subtyping. While our
primary focus is on breast cancer, our framework is designed to easily
accommodate additional modalities, offering the flexibility to scale up or down
with minimal overhead without requiring re-training of existing modalities,
making it applicable to other types of cancers as well. We introduce a
dual-based representation for whole slide images (WSIs), combining traditional
image-based and graph-based WSI representations. This novel dual approach
results in significant performance improvements. Moreover, we present a new
multimodal fusion strategy, demonstrating its ability to enhance performance
across a range of multimodal conditions. Our comprehensive results show that
integrating our dual-based WSI representation with CNV and clinical health
records, along with our pipeline and fusion strategy, outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtyping.

Motivation: 现有密集视频描述方法在处理长视频时遇到计算复杂度和内存限制问题，且需要整个视频作为输入才能进行处理，无法支持在线流式处理。

Method: 提出具有转移状态的状态空间模型(SSMs)，结合SSM的长序列和递归特性，解决SSM在很长上下文中无法维持状态的主要限制。

Result: 方法特别适合在线流式生成描述，不需要等待整个视频处理完成。在密集视频描述中，方法能够良好地适应不同视频长度，并使用7倍更少的FLOPs。

Conclusion: 该方法通过时间缩放SSM模型，有效解决了长视频密集描述的计算和内存挑战，实现了在线流式处理能力，具有重要的实践价值。

Abstract: Dense video captioning is a challenging video understanding task which aims
to simultaneously segment the video into a sequence of meaningful consecutive
events and to generate detailed captions to accurately describe each event.
Existing methods often encounter difficulties when working with the long videos
associated with dense video captioning, due to the computational complexity and
memory limitations. Furthermore, traditional approaches require the entire
video as input, in order to produce an answer, which precludes online
processing of the video. We address these challenges by time-scaling
State-Space Models (SSMs) to even longer sequences than before. Our approach,
State-Space Models with Transfer State, combines both the long-sequence and
recurrent properties of SSMs and addresses the main limitation of SSMs which
are otherwise not able to sustain their state for very long contexts,
effectively scaling SSMs further in time. The proposed model is particularly
suitable for generating captions on-the-fly, in an online or streaming manner,
without having to wait for the full video to be processed, which is more
beneficial in practice. When applied to dense video captioning, our approach
scales well with video lengths and uses 7x fewer FLOPs.

Conclusion: 该框架通过多模态数据的有效整合和创新的模态平衡策略，成功地提升了从EEG信号解码视觉内容的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we propose an innovative framework that integrates EEG, image,
and text data, aiming to decode visual neural representations from low
signal-to-noise ratio EEG signals. Specifically, we introduce text modality to
enhance the semantic correspondence between EEG signals and visual content.
With the explicit semantic labels provided by text, image and EEG features of
the same category can be more closely aligned with the corresponding text
representations in a shared multimodal space. To fully utilize pre-trained
visual and textual representations, we propose an adapter module that
alleviates the instability of high-dimensional representation while
facilitating the alignment and fusion of cross-modal features. Additionally, to
alleviate the imbalance in multimodal feature contributions introduced by the
textual representations, we propose a Modal Consistency Dynamic Balance (MCDB)
strategy that dynamically adjusts the contribution weights of each modality. We
further propose a stochastic perturbation regularization (SPR) term to enhance
the generalization ability of semantic perturbation-based models by introducing
dynamic Gaussian noise in the modality optimization process. The evaluation
results on the ThingsEEG dataset show that our method surpasses previous
state-of-the-art methods in both Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy metrics, improving by
2.0\% and 4.7\% respectively.

Result: 在RDD2022基准测试中超越现有最佳方法，参数量仅为基线方法的20%以下

Conclusion: JTGD方法在保持高性能的同时大幅减少计算资源需求，非常适合实际边缘设备部署

Abstract: Road defect detection is important for road authorities to reduce the vehicle
damage caused by road defects. Considering the practical scenarios where the
defect detectors are typically deployed on edge devices with limited memory and
computational resource, we aim at performing road defect detection without
using ensemble-based methods or test-time augmentation (TTA). To this end, we
propose to Jointly Train the image Generator and Detector for road defect
detection (dubbed as JTGD). We design the dual discriminators for the
generative model to enforce both the synthesized defect patches and overall
images to look plausible. The synthesized image quality is improved by our
proposed CLIP-based Fr\'echet Inception Distance loss. The generative model in
JTGD is trained jointly with the detector to encourage the generative model to
synthesize harder examples for the detector. Since harder synthesized images of
better quality caused by the aforesaid design are used in the data
augmentation, JTGD outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the RDD2022 road
defect detection benchmark across various countries under the condition of no
ensemble and TTA. JTGD only uses less than 20% of the number of parameters
compared with the competing baseline, which makes it more suitable for
deployment on edge devices in practice.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel parameter-efficient adaptation method for
No- Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) using visual prompts optimized
in pixel-space. Unlike full fine-tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), our approach trains only 600K parameters at most (< 0.01% of the base
model), while keeping the underlying model fully frozen. During inference,
these visual prompts are combined with images via addition and processed by
mPLUG-Owl2 with the textual query "Rate the technical quality of the image."
Evaluations across distortion types (synthetic, realistic, AI-generated) on
KADID- 10k, KonIQ-10k, and AGIQA-3k demonstrate competitive performance against
full finetuned methods and specialized NR-IQA models, achieving 0.93 SRCC on
KADID-10k. To our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage pixel-space
visual prompts for NR-IQA, enabling efficient MLLM adaptation for low-level

Motivation: 现有统一多模态模型通常依赖外部视觉组件（如ViT或视觉分词器），导致推理效率低下，特别是处理高分辨率输入时。需要一种更高效、更简洁的统一架构。

Method: 提出纯解码器Transformer架构，使用模态特定的MoE结构和单一自回归目标训练，支持动态分辨率。在LLM中引入多尺度视觉自回归机制，大幅减少解码步骤。

Conclusion: 纯自回归建模作为统一多模态智能的充分且优雅的基础具有强大潜力，OneCAT为此提供了有力证明。

Abstract: We introduce OneCAT, a unified multimodal model that seamlessly integrates
understanding, generation, and editing within a novel, pure decoder-only
transformer architecture. Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for
external components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer
during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for
high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR)
objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we
pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language
Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based
methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings
demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a
sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a
result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing
open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal
generation, editing, and understanding.

Motivation: 为了统一评估海洋对象检测与多目标跟踪模型的性能，提供公平的比较标准和优化指导

Method: 开发了包含中层水和海底生境的4段深海视频的标准数据集，使用高阶跟踪精度指标评估多个检测模型和跟踪器的综合性能

Result: 成功构建了首个公开的深海多目标跟踪标准数据集，并完整提供了数据、工作流程文档和计算工具

Conclusion: 该研究为海洋生物检测和跟踪领域提供了重要的评测标准，有助于推动模型性能的可比较性和持续改进

Abstract: Benchmarking multi-object tracking and object detection model performance is
an essential step in machine learning model development, as it allows
researchers to evaluate model detection and tracker performance on
human-generated 'test' data, facilitating consistent comparisons between models
and trackers and aiding performance optimization. In this study, a novel
benchmark video dataset was developed and used to assess the performance of
several Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute object detection models and a
FathomNet single-class object detection model together with several trackers.
The dataset consists of four video sequences representing midwater and benthic
deep-sea habitats. Performance was evaluated using Higher Order Tracking
Accuracy, a metric that balances detection, localization, and association
accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available
benchmark for multi-object tracking in deep-sea video footage. We provide the
benchmark data, a clearly documented workflow for generating additional
benchmark videos, as well as example Python notebooks for computing metrics.

TL;DR: Strefer是一个合成指令数据生成框架，旨在为视频大语言模型提供时空参考和推理能力，通过伪标注细粒度视频元数据来增强模型对时空参考的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型在粗粒度理解方面表现良好，但在细粒度时空推理方面存在困难，特别是在处理基于时间的事件参考和手势提示的空间锚定时。

Method: 使用数据引擎伪标注时间密集的细粒度视频元数据，包括主体、对象、位置掩码、动作描述和时间线，以结构化方式捕获丰富的时空信息。

Result: 使用Strefer生成数据训练的模型在需要时空消歧的任务上优于基线模型，并展现出增强的时空感知推理能力。

Conclusion: Strefer为感知基础的指令调优视频大语言模型建立了新的基础，无需使用专有模型、昂贵的人工标注或大量新视频标注。

Abstract: Next-generation AI companions must go beyond general video understanding to
resolve spatial and temporal references in dynamic, real-world environments.
Existing Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of
coarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal
reasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for
temporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object
references and positions. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a
synthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs
with spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces
diverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates
temporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and
temporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their
locations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our
approach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal
references, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for
real-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human
annotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental
evaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform
baselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally,
these models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new
foundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs.

TL;DR: 这篇论文开发了一个关于遗传对手写影响的综合数据库，包含210个家庭的手写样本，用于研究手写是否存在遗传特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏专门研究手写遗传特性的数据库，需要创建一个综合性数据库来回答手写是否存在遗传因素、家庭关系是否影响手写等问题。

Method: 收集210个家庭的手写样本，包括祖父母、父母、叔伯、姑姐、兄弟姑妹、堂兄堂姐、姑侄等，采集数字、字母、形状和自由段落等多种手写组件，使用特制设计的表格录入家庭关系。

Result: 通过对家庭成员手写特征的比较研究，发现了他们手写特征和笔迹风格之间的相似性，并建立了免费开放的数据库。

Conclusion: 该研究创建了世界上首个专门研究手写遗传特性的综合数据库，为模式识别领域的研究者提供了重要资源，有助于探索遗传和家庭关系对手写的影响。

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive database for research and investigation
on the effects of inheritance on handwriting. A database has been created that
can be used to answer questions such as: Is there a genetic component to
handwriting? Is handwriting inherited? Do family relationships affect
handwriting? Varieties of samples of handwritten components such as: digits,
letters, shapes and free paragraphs of 210 families including (grandparents,
parents, uncles, aunts, siblings, cousins, nephews and nieces) have been
collected using specially designed forms, and family relationships of all
writers are captured. To the best of our knowledge, no such database is
presently available. Based on comparisons and investigation of features of
handwritings of family members, similarities among their features and writing
styles are detected. Our database is freely available to the pattern
recognition community and hope it will pave the way for investigations on the
effects of inheritance and family relationships on handwritings.

TL;DR: T2I-CoReBench是一个全面的文本到图像生成基准测试，通过12维评估分类法评估模型的组合和推理能力，包含1080个复杂提示和13500个检查问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估文本到图像生成模型的组合和推理能力方面存在局限性，无法全面评估复杂场景和高密度组合，也无法处理多步推理。

Method: 构建基于场景图元素（实例、属性、关系）的组合评估和基于哲学推理框架（演绎、归纳、溯因）的推理评估，形成12维评估分类法，每个提示配有详细检查清单。

Result: 对27个当前T2I模型的实验表明，在复杂高密度场景中组合能力仍然有限，推理能力更是关键瓶颈，所有模型都难以从提示中推断隐含元素。

Conclusion: T2I-CoReBench提供了一个全面复杂的基准测试，揭示了当前T2I模型在组合和推理能力方面的显著不足，特别是推理能力需要重点改进。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation aims to synthesize images from textual
prompts, which jointly specify what must be shown and imply what can be
inferred, thereby corresponding to two core capabilities: composition and
reasoning. However, with the emerging advances of T2I models in reasoning
beyond composition, existing benchmarks reveal clear limitations in providing
comprehensive evaluations across and within these capabilities. Meanwhile,
these advances also enable models to handle more complex prompts, whereas
current benchmarks remain limited to low scene density and simplified
one-to-one reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-CoReBench, a
comprehensive and complex benchmark that evaluates both composition and
reasoning capabilities of T2I models. To ensure comprehensiveness, we structure
composition around scene graph elements (instance, attribute, and relation) and
reasoning around the philosophical framework of inference (deductive,
inductive, and abductive), formulating a 12-dimensional evaluation taxonomy. To
increase complexity, driven by the inherent complexities of real-world
scenarios, we curate each prompt with high compositional density for
composition and multi-step inference for reasoning. We also pair each prompt
with a checklist that specifies individual yes/no questions to assess each
intended element independently to facilitate fine-grained and reliable
evaluation. In statistics, our benchmark comprises 1,080 challenging prompts
and around 13,500 checklist questions. Experiments across 27 current T2I models
reveal that their composition capability still remains limited in complex
high-density scenarios, while the reasoning capability lags even further behind
as a critical bottleneck, with all models struggling to infer implicit elements
from prompts. Our project page: https://t2i-corebench.github.io/.

Motivation: 解决AI产品开发者在利润与用户安全之间偏向选择利润的问题，探索媒体报道作为一种软规制手段的效果

Method: 通过游戏理论建立人工人群模型，模拟自利的创造者和用户之间的交互，分析媒体报道对合作行为的影响

Result: 媒体能够促进创造者与用户之间的合作，但需要保证信息质量、访问成本和安全成本的合理控制，否则合作无法形成

Conclusion: 媒体可以作为一种有效的软规制方式，在缺乏政府监管的情况下促进AI安全发展

Abstract: When developers of artificial intelligence (AI) products need to decide
between profit and safety for the users, they likely choose profit.
Untrustworthy AI technology must come packaged with tangible negative
consequences. Here, we envisage those consequences as the loss of reputation
caused by media coverage of their misdeeds, disseminated to the public. We
explore whether media coverage has the potential to push AI creators into the
production of safe products, enabling widespread adoption of AI technology. We
created artificial populations of self-interested creators and users and
studied them through the lens of evolutionary game theory. Our results reveal
that media is indeed able to foster cooperation between creators and users, but
not always. Cooperation does not evolve if the quality of the information
provided by the media is not reliable enough, or if the costs of either
accessing media or ensuring safety are too high. By shaping public perception
and holding developers accountable, media emerges as a powerful soft regulator
-- guiding AI safety even in the absence of formal government oversight.

can best capitalize on, and contribute to, the future of AI. We present here a
summary and snapshot of the MPS community's perspective, as of Spring/Summer
2025, in a rapidly developing field. The link between AI and MPS is becoming
increasingly inextricable; now is a crucial moment to strengthen the link
between AI and Science by pursuing a strategy that proactively and thoughtfully
leverages the potential of AI for scientific discovery and optimizes
opportunities to impact the development of AI by applying concepts from
fundamental science. To achieve this, we propose activities and strategic
priorities that: (1) enable AI+MPS research in both directions; (2) build up an
interdisciplinary community of AI+MPS researchers; and (3) foster education and
workforce development in AI for MPS researchers and students. We conclude with
a summary of suggested priorities for funding agencies, educational

TL;DR: VLWM是一个基于视觉语言的世界模型，通过语言建模在自然视频上进行训练，能够进行语义和时间抽象的动作推理，在视觉规划任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高层次世界模型在理解和推理具有语义和时间抽象的动作方面仍然不够发达，需要能够进行有效规划的强大世界模型。

Method: VLWM首先推断整体目标达成情况，然后预测由交替动作和世界状态变化组成的轨迹。使用LLM自优化和树状字幕表示压缩的未来观察，同时学习动作策略和动态模型，支持系统1的反应式计划解码和系统2的基于成本最小化的反思式规划。

Result: VLWM在视觉辅助规划(VPA)基准评估和PlannerArena人类评估中达到最先进性能，系统2比系统1的Elo得分提高27%，在RoboVQA和WorldPrediction基准上也优于强VLM基线。

Conclusion: VLWM展示了语言基础世界模型在自然视频上进行有效视觉规划的潜力，通过结合反应式和反思式规划系统，显著提升了规划性能。

Abstract: Effective planning requires strong world models, but high-level world models
that can understand and reason about actions with semantic and temporal
abstraction remain largely underdeveloped. We introduce the Vision Language
World Model (VLWM), a foundation model trained for language-based world
modeling on natural videos. Given visual observations, the VLWM first infers
the overall goal achievements then predicts a trajectory composed of
interleaved actions and world state changes. Those targets are extracted by
iterative LLM Self-Refine conditioned on compressed future observations
represented by Tree of Captions. The VLWM learns both an action policy and a
dynamics model, which respectively facilitates reactive system-1 plan decoding
and reflective system-2 planning via cost minimization. The cost evaluates the
semantic distance between the hypothetical future states given by VLWM
roll-outs and the expected goal state, and is measured by a critic model that
we trained in a self-supervised manner. The VLWM achieves state-of-the-art
Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA) performance on both benchmark evaluations
and our proposed PlannerArena human evaluations, where system-2 improves the
Elo score by +27% upon system-1. The VLWM models also outperforms strong VLM
baselines on RoboVQA and WorldPrediction benchmark.

Motivation: 解决现有语义操作符在大规模数据集上执行成本高、不适合交互式分析的问题，以及深度研究系统缺乏查询计划优化导致执行效率低的问题。

Method: 构建原型系统，让深度研究系统中的LLM组件能够编写和执行优化的语义操作符程序，结合了两种方法的优势。

Conclusion: 这种结合优化执行和灵活性的方法为AI驱动数据分析提供了更好的解决方案，是向更高效AI分析运行时的重要一步。

Abstract: With advances in large language models (LLMs), researchers are creating new
systems that can perform AI-driven analytics over large unstructured datasets.
Recent work has explored executing such analytics queries using semantic
operators -- a declarative set of AI-powered data transformations with natural
language specifications. However, even when optimized, these operators can be
expensive to execute on millions of records and their iterator execution
semantics make them ill-suited for interactive data analytics tasks. In another
line of work, Deep Research systems have demonstrated an ability to answer
natural language question(s) over large datasets. These systems use one or more
LLM agent(s) to plan their execution, process the dataset(s), and iteratively
refine their answer. However, these systems do not explicitly optimize their
query plans which can lead to poor plan execution. In order for AI-driven
analytics to excel, we need a runtime which combines the optimized execution of
semantic operators with the flexibility and more dynamic execution of Deep
Research systems. As a first step towards this vision, we build a prototype
which enables Deep Research agents to write and execute optimized semantic
operator programs. We evaluate our prototype and demonstrate that it can
outperform a handcrafted semantic operator program and open Deep Research
systems on two basic queries. Compared to a standard open Deep Research agent,
our prototype achieves up to 1.95x better F1-score. Furthermore, even if we
give the agent access to semantic operators as tools, our prototype still
achieves cost and runtime savings of up to 76.8% and 72.7% thanks to its
optimized execution.

Conclusion: 识别了可有效转移的技术，分析了其他技术失败的原因，并讨论了自主驾驶场景的特定适配需求

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have not only advanced
natural language processing but also inspired their application in domains with
structurally similar problems--most notably, autonomous driving motion
generation. Both domains involve autoregressive sequence modeling, token-based
representations, and context-aware decision making, making the transfer of LLM
components a natural and increasingly common practice. However, despite
promising early attempts, a systematic understanding of which LLM modules are
truly transferable remains lacking. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
evaluation of five key LLM modules--tokenizer design, positional embedding,
pre-training paradigms, post-training strategies, and test-time
computation--within the context of motion generation for autonomous driving.
Through extensive experiments on the Waymo Sim Agents benchmark, we demonstrate
that, when appropriately adapted, these modules can significantly improve
performance for autonomous driving motion generation. In addition, we identify
which techniques can be effectively transferred, analyze the potential reasons
for the failure of others, and discuss the specific adaptations needed for
autonomous driving scenarios. We evaluate our method on the Sim Agents task and
achieve competitive results.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based task plans and corresponding human
demonstrations for embodied AI may be noisy, with unnecessary actions,
redundant navigation, and logical errors that reduce policy quality. We propose
an iterative verification framework in which a Judge LLM critiques action
sequences and a Planner LLM applies the revisions, yielding progressively
cleaner and more spatially coherent trajectories. Unlike rule-based approaches,
our method relies on natural language prompting, enabling broad generalization
across error types including irrelevant actions, contradictions, and missing
steps. On a set of manually annotated actions from the TEACh embodied AI
dataset, our framework achieves up to 90% recall and 100% precision across four
state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5, LLaMA 4 Scout).
The refinement loop converges quickly, with 96.5% of sequences requiring at
most three iterations, while improving both temporal efficiency and spatial
action organization. Crucially, the method preserves human error-recovery
patterns rather than collapsing them, supporting future work on robust
corrective behavior. By establishing plan verification as a reliable LLM
capability for spatial planning and action refinement, we provide a scalable
path to higher-quality training data for imitation learning in embodied AI.

Method: 系统分析基于三个关键原则的变换：解接受、低层启发式重复和扰动强度（受扰动影响的解比例），并在简单的随机选择机制上验证变换效果。

Conclusion: 策略变换可以显著提升超启发式性能，甚至简化复杂方法的设计，证明了低层启发式集合组成和变换的重要性。

Abstract: Cross-domain selection hyper-heuristics aim to distill decades of research on
problem-specific heuristic search algorithms into adaptable general-purpose
search strategies. In this respect, existing selection hyper-heuristics
primarily focus on an adaptive selection of low-level heuristics (LLHs) from a
predefined set. In contrast, we concentrate on the composition of this set and
its strategic transformations. We systematically analyze transformations based
on three key principles: solution acceptance, LLH repetitions, and perturbation
intensity, i.e., the proportion of a solution affected by a perturbative LLH.
We demonstrate the raw effects of our transformations on a trivial unbiased
random selection mechanism. With an appropriately constructed transformation,
this trivial method outperforms all available state-of-the-art hyper-heuristics
on three challenging real-world domains and finds 11 new best-known solutions.
The same method is competitive with the winner of the CHeSC competition,
commonly used as the standard cross-domain benchmark. Moreover, we accompany
several recent hyper-heuristics with such strategic transformations. Using this
approach, we outperform the current state-of-the-art methods on both the CHeSC
benchmark and real-world domains while often simplifying their designs.

Conclusion: 该方法解决了符号化策略学习方法的扩展性问题，为大规模规划问题的策略学习提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Combinatorial methods for learning general policies that solve large
collections of planning problems have been recently developed. One of their
strengths, in relation to deep learning approaches, is that the resulting
policies can be understood and shown to be correct. A weakness is that the
methods do not scale up and learn only from small training instances and
feature pools that contain a few hundreds of states and features at most. In
this work, we propose a new symbolic method for learning policies based on the
generalization of sampled plans that ensures structural termination and hence
acyclicity. The proposed learning approach is not based on SAT/ASP, as previous
symbolic methods, but on a hitting set algorithm that can effectively handle
problems with millions of states, and pools with hundreds of thousands of
features. The formal properties of the approach are analyzed, and its
scalability is tested on a number of benchmarks.

Abstract: Adaptive exploration methods propose ways to learn complex policies via
alternating between exploration and exploitation. An important question for
such methods is to determine the appropriate moment to switch between
exploration and exploitation and vice versa. This is critical in domains that
require the learning of long and complex sequences of actions. In this work, we
present a generic adaptive exploration framework that employs uncertainty to
address this important issue in a principled manner. Our framework includes
previous adaptive exploration approaches as special cases. Moreover, we can
incorporate in our framework any uncertainty-measuring mechanism of choice, for
instance mechanisms used in intrinsic motivation or epistemic uncertainty-based
exploration methods. We experimentally demonstrate that our framework gives
rise to adaptive exploration strategies that outperform standard ones across
several MuJoCo environments.

focus on the ''what'' that should be done and less on the ''how'', creating a
knowledge gap for actors. Through an extensive analysis, we found that the term
accountability is perceived and dealt with in many different ways, depending on
the actor's expertise and domain of work. With increasing concerns about AI
accountability issues and the ambiguity around this term, this paper bridges
the gap between the ''what'' and ''how'' of AI accountability, specifically for
AI systems in healthcare. We do this by analysing the concept of
accountability, formulating an accountability framework, and providing a
three-tier structure for handling various accountability mechanisms. Our
accountability framework positions the regulations of healthcare AI systems and
the mechanisms adopted by the actors under a consistent accountability regime.
Moreover, the three-tier structure guides the actors of the healthcare AI
system to categorise the mechanisms based on their conduct. Through our
framework, we advocate that decision-making in healthcare AI holds shared
dependencies, where accountability should be dealt with jointly and should
foster collaborations. We highlight the role of explainability in instigating
communication and information sharing between the actors to further facilitate
the collaborative process.

just models -- providing empirical insights and complete reference
implementations for production-oriented agent systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了InAbHyD数据集来评估大语言模型的归纳和溯因推理能力，发现LLMs在简单场景中能进行此类推理，但在复杂世界模型中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注演绎推理，而归纳和溯因推理在解决现实问题中同样重要但研究较少，需要系统评估LLMs在这两类推理上的能力。

Method: 创建可编程合成数据集InAbHyD，包含不完整世界模型和观察数据；提出基于奥卡姆剃刀原理的新评估指标；测试多种先进LLMs及其推理增强技术。

Result: LLMs在简单场景中能进行归纳和溯因推理，但在复杂世界模型中表现困难，即使使用上下文学习和RLVR等流行技术也难以产生高质量假设。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在复杂归纳和溯因推理方面仍有局限，需要开发更有效的技术来提升其在这两类推理任务上的表现。

Abstract: Reasoning is a core capability in artificial intelligence systems, for which
large language models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress. However,
most work focuses exclusively on deductive reasoning, which is problematic
since other types of reasoning are also essential in solving real-world
problems, and they are less explored. This work focuses on evaluating LLMs'
inductive and abductive reasoning capabilities. We introduce a programmable and
synthetic dataset, InAbHyD (pronounced in-a-bid), where each reasoning example
consists of an incomplete world model and a set of observations. The task for
the intelligent agent is to produce hypotheses to explain observations under
the incomplete world model to solve each reasoning example. We propose a new
metric to evaluate the quality of hypotheses based on Occam's Razor. We
evaluate and analyze some state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis shows that LLMs
can perform inductive and abductive reasoning in simple scenarios, but struggle
with complex world models and producing high-quality hypotheses, even with
popular reasoning-enhancing techniques such as in-context learning and RLVR.

Conclusion: 本文框架通过基于环境变化的底层设计和aspects概念，成功解决了AI代理的信息泄漏问题，实现了零泄漏。这种专业化代理在专门信息层面工作的方式，为AI代理系统的安全性和效率提供了重要改进。

Abstract: Agentic LLM AI agents are often little more than autonomous chatbots: actors
following scripts, often controlled by an unreliable director. This work
introduces a bottom-up framework that situates AI agents in their environment,
with all behaviors triggered by changes in their environments. It introduces
the notion of aspects, similar to the idea of umwelt, where sets of agents
perceive their environment differently to each other, enabling clearer control
of information. We provide an illustrative implementation and show that
compared to a typical architecture, which leaks up to 83% of the time,
aspective agentic AI enables zero information leakage. We anticipate that this
concept of specialist agents working efficiently in their own information
niches can provide improvements to both security and efficiency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统研究了具身AI系统的对抗性安全攻击，基于ISO标准提出了安全违规分类法，创建了ANNIEBench基准测试和ANNIE-Attack攻击框架，在代表性EAI模型中攻击成功率超过50%，揭示了物理AI时代的安全威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉-语言-动作模型在具身AI机器人中的集成，系统面临新的安全风险：受损的VLA模型可将对抗性扰动直接转化为不安全的物理动作。传统机器学习安全方法已不足够，需要研究在物理接地交互环境中的安全定义、测量和防御机制。

Method: 1) 基于物理约束（分离距离、速度、碰撞边界）形式化安全违规分类法（关键、危险、风险）；2) 创建ANNIEBench基准，包含9个安全关键场景和2400个视频-动作序列；3) 开发ANNIE-Attack任务感知对抗框架，使用攻击引导模型将长时程目标分解为帧级扰动。

Result: 在代表性EAI模型上的评估显示，所有安全类别的攻击成功率均超过50%。展示了稀疏和自适应攻击策略，并通过物理机器人实验验证了实际影响。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了具身AI系统中先前未被充分探索但后果严重的攻击面，强调了物理AI时代对安全驱动防御的迫切需求。

Abstract: The integration of vision-language-action (VLA) models into embodied AI (EAI)
robots is rapidly advancing their ability to perform complex, long-horizon
tasks in humancentric environments. However, EAI systems introduce critical
security risks: a compromised VLA model can directly translate adversarial
perturbations on sensory input into unsafe physical actions. Traditional safety
definitions and methodologies from the machine learning community are no longer
sufficient. EAI systems raise new questions, such as what constitutes safety,
how to measure it, and how to design effective attack and defense mechanisms in
physically grounded, interactive settings. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of adversarial safety attacks on embodied AI systems, grounded
in ISO standards for human-robot interactions. We (1) formalize a principled
taxonomy of safety violations (critical, dangerous, risky) based on physical
constraints such as separation distance, velocity, and collision boundaries;
(2) introduce ANNIEBench, a benchmark of nine safety-critical scenarios with
2,400 video-action sequences for evaluating embodied safety; and (3)
ANNIE-Attack, a task-aware adversarial framework with an attack leader model
that decomposes long-horizon goals into frame-level perturbations. Our
evaluation across representative EAI models shows attack success rates
exceeding 50% across all safety categories. We further demonstrate sparse and
adaptive attack strategies and validate the real-world impact through physical
robot experiments. These results expose a previously underexplored but highly
consequential attack surface in embodied AI systems, highlighting the urgent
need for security-driven defenses in the physical AI era. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统坐标预测方法在自动驾驶中缺乏物理可解释性和计算效率低的问题，通过参数化输出实现物理上合理的轨迹预测。

Method: 微调LLM输出轨迹模型的核心物理参数而非原始坐标，对于车道保持预测离散坐标，对于车道变换生成增强正弦加速度模型(SAM)的参数。

Result: 实现了98.73%的整体意图预测准确率，输出大小比基于坐标的方法减少80%，性能与传统LLM预测器相当但具有更好的可解释性和资源效率。

Conclusion: SAM-LLM提供了一种连续、物理合理且计算高效的轨迹预测方法，在保持高性能的同时显著提升了可解释性和效率。

Abstract: This work introduces SAM-LLM, a novel hybrid architecture that bridges the
gap between the contextual reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the
physical precision of kinematic lane change models for autonomous driving. The
system is designed for interpretable lane change trajectory prediction by
finetuning an LLM to output the core physical parameters of a trajectory model
instead of raw coordinates. For lane-keeping scenarios, the model predicts
discrete coordinates, but for lane change maneuvers, it generates the
parameters for an enhanced Sinusoidal Acceleration Model (SAM), including
lateral displacement, maneuver duration, initial lateral velocity, and
longitudinal velocity change. This parametric approach yields a complete,
continuous, and physically plausible trajectory model that is inherently
interpretable and computationally efficient, achieving an 80% reduction in
output size compared to coordinate-based methods. The SAM-LLM achieves a
state-of-the-art overall intention prediction accuracy of 98.73%, demonstrating
performance equivalent to traditional LLM predictors while offering significant
advantages in explainability and resource efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过长期神经元停用和独创的状态记忆机制，该方法提出了一种更强的正则化方法，解决了神经元复活时的训练不稳定性问题，并在图像分类任务上实现了更好的泛化性能和稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Dropout等方法中神经元临时停用的局限性，通过长期停用神经元来实现更强的正则化效果，但这会导致神经元复活时的训练不稳定性问题。

Method: 提出Lifecycle(LC)原则，核心是状态记忆机制。当神经元被复活时，不是重新初始化为随机权重，而是恢复到其上次有效状态的参数设置，保留已学习的知识。

Result: 理论分析显示LC原则能够平滑损失函数地形，导向更平坦的最小值，这与更好的泛化性能相关。图像分类实验证明方法提升了泛化性能和稳健性，切除实验确认状态记忆机制的关键作用。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种有效的长期神经元停用正则化方法，通过状态记忆机制成功解决了训练不稳定性问题，为深度学习模型的正则化提供了新的思路和技术。

Abstract: I investigate a stronger form of regularization by deactivating neurons for
extended periods, a departure from the temporary changes of methods like
Dropout. However, this long-term dynamism introduces a critical challenge:
severe training instability when neurons are revived with random weights. To
solve this, I propose the Lifecycle (LC) principle, a regularization mechanism
centered on a key innovation: state memory. Instead of re-initializing a
revived neuron, my method restores its parameters to their last known effective
state. This process preserves learned knowledge and avoids destructive
optimization shocks. My theoretical analysis reveals that the LC principle
smooths the loss landscape, guiding optimization towards flatter minima
associated with better generalization. Experiments on image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that my method improves generalization and robustness.
Crucially, ablation studies confirm that state memory is essential for
achieving these gains.

Motivation: 解决野生动物保护中非法盗猎的实时响应挑战，特别是在广阔且部分可观测环境中需要高效的多无人机协同巡逻。

Method: 使用EM算法建模隐藏环境因素和智能体间动态关系，通过隐变量增强不确定环境下的探索和协调能力，构建EM-MARL框架。

Abstract: Protecting endangered wildlife from illegal poaching presents a critical
challenge, particularly in vast and partially observable environments where
real-time response is essential. This paper introduces a novel
Expectation-Maximization (EM) based latent variable modeling approach in the
context of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) coordination in wildlife protection. By modeling hidden
environmental factors and inter-agent dynamics through latent variables, our
method enhances exploration and coordination under uncertainty.We implement and
evaluate our EM-MARL framework using a custom simulation involving 10 UAVs
tasked with patrolling protected habitats of the endangered Iranian leopard.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate superior performance in detection
accuracy, adaptability, and policy convergence when compared to standard
algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Deterministic
Policy Gradient (DDPG). Our findings underscore the potential of combining EM
inference with MARL to improve decentralized decisionmaking in complex,
high-stakes conservation scenarios. The full implementation, simulation
environment, and training scripts are publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: 群体感知阈值校准方法通过为不同人口群体设置不同的决策阈值，在类别不平衡问题上比传统合成数据生成方法表现更优，实现了更高的平衡准确率和最差群体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 类别不平衡是机器学习中的基础挑战，传统解决方案往往带来新问题。研究发现需要一种更稳健的方法来处理不同人口群体的性能差异。

Method: 提出群体感知阈值校准方法，为不同人口群体设置不同的决策阈值，而不是对所有群体使用单一阈值。该方法优化了平衡准确率和最差群体平衡准确率之间的帕累托前沿。

Result: 实验显示群体特定阈值比SMOTE和CT-GAN增强模型获得1.5-4%更高的平衡准确率，同时改善了最差群体平衡准确率。在七个模型家族中均证实有效性。

Conclusion: 群体感知阈值校准提供了比合成数据生成方法更简单、更可解释且更有效的解决方案，且发现将群体阈值应用于合成增强数据几乎没有额外收益，表明这些方法是冗余的。

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning, with
traditional solutions often creating as many problems as they solve. We
demonstrate that group-aware threshold calibration--setting different decision
thresholds for different demographic groups--provides superior robustness
compared to synthetic data generation methods. Through extensive experiments,
we show that group-specific thresholds achieve 1.5-4% higher balanced accuracy
than SMOTE and CT-GAN augmented models while improving worst-group balanced
accuracy. Unlike single-threshold approaches that apply one cutoff across all
groups, our group-aware method optimizes the Pareto frontier between balanced
accuracy and worst-group balanced accuracy, enabling fine-grained control over
group-level performance. Critically, we find that applying group thresholds to
synthetically augmented data yields minimal additional benefit, suggesting
these approaches are fundamentally redundant. Our results span seven model
families including linear, tree-based, instance-based, and boosting methods,
confirming that group-aware threshold calibration offers a simpler, more
interpretable, and more effective solution to class imbalance.

TL;DR: 基于DPO的精细化算法DPO-PRO，通过分布粗糖优化提升对偏好信号噪声的高敏感性，在公共健康资源分配任务中设计奖励函数，以更低的推理成本达到类似自反思基线的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共健康领域的连续资源分配问题具有复杂和模糊的目标，且数据有限，需要基于人类自然语言偏好设计奖励函数，对噪声偏好信号具有更高的稳健性。

Method: 提出DPO-PRO算法，结合直接偏好优化(DPO)和轻量级的分布粗糖优化(DRO)方法，考虑偏好分布的不确定性，但比之前的DRO基方法更少保守。

Result: 在ARMMAN母婴移动健康项目和标准对齐测试集上，DPO-PRO在噪声偏好信号下的稳健性明显优于现有DPO变体，且以更低的推理成本达到了类似自反思基线的性能。

Conclusion: DPO-PRO为具有复杂目标和有限数据的实际应用提供了一种高敏感性且效率的奖励函数设计方法，在公共健康等领域有着广阔应用前景。

Abstract: We study an LLM fine-tuning task for designing reward functions for
sequential resource allocation problems in public health, guided by human
preferences expressed in natural language. This setting presents a challenging
testbed for alignment due to complex and ambiguous objectives and limited data
availability. We propose DPO-PRO, a robust fine-tuning algorithm based on
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which accounts for uncertainty in the
preference distribution using a lightweight Distributionally Robust
Optimization (DRO) formulation. Unlike prior DRO-based DPO methods, DPO-PRO is
significantly less conservative. We evaluate DPO-PRO on a real-world maternal
mobile health program operated by the non-profit organization ARMMAN, as well
as on standard alignment benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method consistently improves robustness to noisy preference signals compared to
existing DPO variants. Moreover, DPO-PRO achieves comparable performance to
prior self-reflection-based baseline for reward function design, while
requiring significantly lower inference-time cost.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Action Collapse Policy Gradient (ACPG)方法，通过在策略梯度方法中固定动作选择层为等角紧框架(ETF)结构，诱导神经网络产生理想的配置，从而更快更鲁棒地获得更好的奖励表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现策略网络在特定约束下会出现类似神经坍缩的Action Collapse现象，即相同最优动作的状态-动作激活会坍缩到其均值，且动作选择层权重与均值激活会坍缩到ETF结构。由于ETF能最大化分离动作空间中的角度，因此考虑使用固定ETF作为目标配置来学习最优策略。

Method: 提出ACPG方法，在离散策略梯度方法中固定动作选择层为合成的ETF结构，诱导策略DNN产生理想的ETF配置同时保持最优性。

Result: 在多个OpenAI Gym环境中的实验表明，ACPG可以集成到任何离散策略梯度方法中，能够更快更鲁棒地获得奖励提升。

Conclusion: 使用固定ETF作为动作选择层可以自然导致Action Collapse现象，ACPG方法通过这种结构设计有效提升了策略梯度方法的性能和收敛速度。

Abstract: Policy gradient (PG) methods in reinforcement learning frequently utilize
deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn a shared backbone of feature
representations used to compute likelihoods in an action selection layer.
Numerous studies have been conducted on the convergence and global optima of
policy networks, but few have analyzed representational structures of those
underlying networks. While training an optimal policy DNN, we observed that
under certain constraints, a gentle structure resembling neural collapse, which
we refer to as Action Collapse (AC), emerges. This suggests that 1) the
state-action activations (i.e. last-layer features) sharing the same optimal
actions collapse towards those optimal actions respective mean activations; 2)
the variability of activations sharing the same optimal actions converges to
zero; 3) the weights of action selection layer and the mean activations
collapse to a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF). Our early work showed
those aforementioned constraints to be necessary for these observations. Since
the collapsed ETF of optimal policy DNNs maximally separates the pair-wise
angles of all actions in the state-action space, we naturally raise a question:
can we learn an optimal policy using an ETF structure as a (fixed) target
configuration in the action selection layer? Our analytical proof shows that
learning activations with a fixed ETF as action selection layer naturally leads
to the AC. We thus propose the Action Collapse Policy Gradient (ACPG) method,
which accordingly affixes a synthetic ETF as our action selection layer. ACPG
induces the policy DNN to produce such an ideal configuration in the action
selection layer while remaining optimal. Our experiments across various OpenAI
Gym environments demonstrate that our technique can be integrated into any
discrete PG methods and lead to favorable reward improvements more quickly and
robustly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号具有噪声大、高维、非线性的特点，传统机器学习方法难以捕捉其复杂的时空动态特性，需要更先进的序列建模方法来提升神经疾病诊断的准确性。

Method: 采用Mamba选择性状态空间模型，在大规模癫痫和非癫痫EEG数据集上进行训练，先进行自监督重建任务，然后进行癫痫检测任务。

Result: 在保留测试集上达到0.72的AUROC，证明了该模型在处理EEG数据方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为开发大规模、临床适用的EEG基础模型迈出了重要一步，展示了基础模型在EEG分析中的潜力。

Abstract: This work explores the potential of foundation models, specifically a
Mamba-based selective state space model, for enhancing EEG analysis in
neurological disorder diagnosis. EEG, crucial for diagnosing conditions like
epilepsy, presents significant challenges due to its noisy, high-dimensional,
and nonlinear nature. Traditional machine learning methods have made advances
in automating EEG analysis but often fail to capture its complex
spatio-temporal dynamics. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly in
sequence modeling, offer new avenues for creating more generalized and
expressive models capable of handling such complexities. By training a
Mamba-based model on a large dataset containing seizure and non-seizure EEG
recordings through a self-supervised reconstruction task followed by a seizure
detection task, we demonstrate the model's effectiveness, achieving an AUROC of
0.72 on a held-out test set. This approach marks a significant step toward
developing large-scale, clinically applicable foundation models for EEG data
analysis.

TL;DR: LExI是一种数据无关的优化技术，通过分析模型权重自适应确定每层最优激活专家数量，显著提升MoE模型推理效率且精度损失可忽略


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE剪枝方法主要减少内存占用但无法显著提升GPU推理性能，且固定激活专家数量导致冗余计算和次优性能

Method: 利用模型权重估计各层相对重要性，自适应分配每层激活专家数量，无需训练数据

Result: 在语言和视觉MoE基准测试中显著优于传统剪枝方法，Qwen1.5-MoE在H100 GPU上实现相同吞吐量且精度提升10%

Conclusion: LExI通过层间专家数量自适应分配有效解决了MoE模型推理效率问题，为后训练优化提供了新方向

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale efficiently by activating only a subset
of experts per token, offering a computationally sparse alternative to dense
architectures. While prior post-training optimizations, such as inter- and
intra-expert pruning, reduce memory usage they provide limited gains in
inference-time compute efficiency. Moreover, existing MoE architectures
typically activate a fixed number of experts uniformly across all layers,
resulting in redundant computation and suboptimal performance. In this work, we
first demonstrate that MoE pruning strategies improve only the memory footprint
but do not significantly improve inference performance on GPU using optimized
frameworks such as vLLM. To address this, we introduce LExI, a data-free
optimization technique that determines the optimal number of active experts per
layer in a pretrained MoE model. LExI leverages only the model weights to
estimate the relative importance of each layer and adaptively assigns the
number of active experts accordingly per layer. Experiments on state-of-the-art
language and vision MoE benchmarks demonstrate that LExI significantly
outperforms traditional MoE pruning approaches in terms of inference efficiency
with negligible accuracy loss. For example, using LExI, Qwen1.5-MoE achieves
the same throughput on Nvidia H100 GPU with 10% better accuracy than
traditional expert pruning.

Motivation: 为了解决从不同类型、不同稀疏度和分辨率的地下观测数据中重建地下属性的挑战，需要一种能够处理任意数量模态并支持灵活输入的模型架构。

Method: 采用transformer架构，结合位置编码和模态编码（通过文本嵌入模型生成），支持八种模态包括方向角、分类类别和连续属性，实现上下文学习能力。

Conclusion: Transparent Earth作为地球地下基础模型的初步实现，具备预测地球上任何位置任何地下属性的潜力，为地下科学研究提供了强有力的工具。

Abstract: We present the Transparent Earth, a transformer-based architecture for
reconstructing subsurface properties from heterogeneous datasets that vary in
sparsity, resolution, and modality, where each modality represents a distinct
type of observation (e.g., stress angle, mantle temperature, tectonic plate
type). The model incorporates positional encodings of observations together
with modality encodings, derived from a text embedding model applied to a
description of each modality. This design enables the model to scale to an
arbitrary number of modalities, making it straightforward to add new ones not
considered in the initial design. We currently include eight modalities
spanning directional angles, categorical classes, and continuous properties
such as temperature and thickness. These capabilities support in-context
learning, enabling the model to generate predictions either with no inputs or
with an arbitrary number of additional observations from any subset of
modalities. On validation data, this reduces errors in predicting stress angle
by more than a factor of three. The proposed architecture is scalable and
demonstrates improved performance with increased parameters. Together, these
advances make the Transparent Earth an initial foundation model for the Earth's
subsurface that ultimately aims to predict any subsurface property anywhere on
Earth.

Result: 实验验证了该方法在多假设泛化和损失感知集成聚合之间的关系，并在深度学习预测器上研究了复杂度-容量-多样性权衡。

Conclusion: 结构化基函数网络提供了一个统一的预测不确定性框架，能够有效处理结构化模糊性，并通过可调参数实现偏差-方差-多样性的平衡。

Abstract: Existing approaches to predictive uncertainty rely either on multi-hypothesis
prediction, which promotes diversity but lacks principled aggregation, or on
ensemble learning, which improves accuracy but rarely captures the structured
ambiguity. This implicitly means that a unified framework consistent with the
loss geometry remains absent. The Structured Basis Function Network addresses
this gap by linking multi-hypothesis prediction and ensembling through
centroidal aggregation induced by Bregman divergences. The formulation applies
across regression and classification by aligning predictions with the geometry
of the loss, and supports both a closed-form least-squares estimator and a
gradient-based procedure for general objectives. A tunable diversity mechanism
provides parametric control of the bias-variance-diversity trade-off,
connecting multi-hypothesis generalisation with loss-aware ensemble
aggregation. Experiments validate this relation and use the mechanism to study
the complexity-capacity-diversity trade-off across datasets of increasing
difficulty with deep-learning predictors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出通过归纳学习拉普拉斯特征向量来预训练图神经网络的新框架，解决传统MPNN因网络深度增加导致的过平滑问题，能更好地捕获全局和区域图结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统消息传递神经网络(MPNN)在增加网络深度时容易出现过平滑风险，难以有效捕获全局和区域图结构。图拉普拉斯矩阵的低频特征向量编码了全局信息，通过预训练GNN预测这些特征向量可以鼓励网络自然学习大规模结构模式。

Method: 提出自监督预训练框架，通过归纳学习图拉普拉斯特征向量来预训练GNN。该方法基于图结构，具有高度灵活性，可应用于所有基于图的数据集，在任务特定数据稀疏时还可使用合成特征。

Result: 实验表明，通过该框架预训练的模型在各种基于图结构的任务上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种有效的方法来预训练GNN，使其能够更好地学习图的全局结构信息，相比专注于领域特定任务（如节点或边特征重建）的现有预训练方法更具通用性和灵活性。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by
inductively learning Laplacian eigenvectors. Traditional Message Passing Neural
Networks (MPNNs) often struggle to capture global and regional graph structure
due to over-smoothing risk as network depth increases. Because the
low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix encode global
information, pre-training GNNs to predict these eigenvectors encourages the
network to naturally learn large-scale structural patterns over each graph.
Empirically, we show that models pre-trained via our framework outperform
baseline models on a variety of graph structure-based tasks. While most
existing pre-training methods focus on domain-specific tasks like node or edge
feature reconstruction, our self-supervised pre-training framework is
structure-based and highly flexible. Eigenvector-learning can be applied to all
graph-based datasets, and can be used with synthetic features when
task-specific data is sparse.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现视觉语言模型(VLMs)中存在可分离的冲突检测和冲突解决机制，通过线性探针和注意力模式分析揭示了这些功能在不同网络层中的分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型中冲突检测与冲突解决机制难以分离的挑战，以提升模型的可解释性和在复杂多模态环境中的鲁棒性。

Method: 对LLaVA-OV-7B模型进行机制性研究，使用线性探针提取监督指标，并通过基于组的注意力模式分析来识别冲突检测和解决的不同阶段。

Result: 发现模型中间层出现线性可解码的冲突信号，冲突检测和解决的注意力模式在网络不同阶段出现分化，证实了这两种机制的功能独立性。

Conclusion: 冲突检测与解决的分解为实现更可操作的可解释性和针对性干预提供了基础，有助于提升模型在多模态冲突场景中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper highlights the challenge of decomposing conflict detection from
conflict resolution in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and presents potential
approaches, including using a supervised metric via linear probes and
group-based attention pattern analysis. We conduct a mechanistic investigation
of LLaVA-OV-7B, a state-of-the-art VLM that exhibits diverse resolution
behaviors when faced with conflicting multimodal inputs. Our results show that
a linearly decodable conflict signal emerges in the model's intermediate layers
and that attention patterns associated with conflict detection and resolution
diverge at different stages of the network. These findings support the
hypothesis that detection and resolution are functionally distinct mechanisms.
We discuss how such decomposition enables more actionable interpretability and
targeted interventions for improving model robustness in challenging multimodal
settings.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型遗忘方法在严格评估下效果不佳，需要更有效的技术来安全删除预训练中的私有数据或有害知识。

Method: 提出JensUn方法，利用Jensen-Shannon散度作为遗忘集和保留集的训练目标，实现更稳定有效的遗忘动态；同时引入LKF数据集和基于LLM的语义评估框架进行精确评估。

Result: JensUn在广泛实验中实现了比竞争方法更好的遗忘-效用权衡，并表现出对良性再学习的强韧性；新的评估框架显示许多现有方法效果不如预期。

Conclusion: JensUn提供了一种有效的大语言模型遗忘解决方案，配合改进的评估框架能够更准确地衡量遗忘方法的真实性能。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) involves precisely removing
specific information from a pre-trained model. This is crucial to ensure safety
of LLMs by deleting private data or harmful knowledge acquired during
pre-training. However, existing unlearning methods often fall short when
subjected to thorough evaluation. To overcome this, we introduce JensUn, where
we leverage the Jensen-Shannon Divergence as the training objective for both
forget and retain sets for more stable and effective unlearning dynamics
compared to commonly used loss functions. In extensive experiments, JensUn
achieves better forget-utility trade-off than competing methods, and even
demonstrates strong resilience to benign relearning. Additionally, for a
precise unlearning evaluation, we introduce LKF, a curated dataset of
lesser-known facts that provides a realistic unlearning scenario. Finally, to
comprehensively test unlearning methods, we propose (i) employing an LLM as
semantic judge instead of the standard ROUGE score, and (ii) using worst-case
unlearning evaluation over various paraphrases and input formats. Our improved
evaluation framework reveals that many existing methods are less effective than
previously thought.

TL;DR: 这篇论文比较了混合多数投票咆集成堆叠两种集成学习方法在肥胖风险预测中的性能，发现集成堆叠方法在复杂数据分布下表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肥胖是全球急需关注的健康问题，与多种慢性疾病相关。尽管机器学习在早期肥胖风险预测中展现出潜力，但对于混合多数投票咆集成堆叠这两种集成技术的比较评估仍有限。

Method: 使用两个数据集评估三种集成模型：多数硬投票、权重硬投票咆堆叠（以多层感知机作为元分类器）。分析了9种机器学习算法的50个超参数配置，选择前三个模型作为基学习器。预处理步骤包括数据集平衡咆离群点检测，使用准确率咆F1分数评估模型性能。

Result: 在数据集1上，权重硬投票咆堆叠方法表现几乎相同（准确率0.920304，F1分数0.920070），超过了多数硬投票。在数据集2上，堆叠方法表现最优（准确率0.989837，F1分数0.989825），而权重硬投票表现最差。

Conclusion: 结果证明集成堆叠方法具有更强的预测能力，尤其适用于复杂的数据分布，而混合多数投票仍是一种稳健的替代方案。

Abstract: Obesity is a critical global health issue driven by dietary, physiological,
and environmental factors, and is strongly associated with chronic diseases
such as diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer. Machine learning has
emerged as a promising approach for early obesity risk prediction, yet a
comparative evaluation of ensemble techniques -- particularly hybrid majority
voting and ensemble stacking -- remains limited. This study aims to compare
hybrid majority voting and ensemble stacking methods for obesity risk
prediction, identifying which approach delivers higher accuracy and efficiency.
The analysis seeks to highlight the complementary strengths of these ensemble
techniques in guiding better predictive model selection for healthcare
applications. Two datasets were utilized to evaluate three ensemble models:
Majority Hard Voting, Weighted Hard Voting, and Stacking (with a Multi-Layer
Perceptron as meta-classifier). A pool of nine Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms, evaluated across a total of 50 hyperparameter configurations, was
analyzed to identify the top three models to serve as base learners for the
ensemble methods. Preprocessing steps involved dataset balancing, and outlier
detection, and model performance was evaluated using Accuracy and F1-Score. On
Dataset-1, weighted hard voting and stacking achieved nearly identical
performance (Accuracy: 0.920304, F1: 0.920070), outperforming majority hard
voting. On Dataset-2, stacking demonstrated superior results (Accuracy:
0.989837, F1: 0.989825) compared to majority hard voting (Accuracy: 0.981707,
F1: 0.981675) and weighted hard voting, which showed the lowest performance.
The findings confirm that ensemble stacking provides stronger predictive
capability, particularly for complex data distributions, while hybrid majority
voting remains a robust alternative.

Abstract: Conformal prediction has been explored as a general and efficient way to
provide uncertainty quantification for time series. However, current methods
struggle to handle time series data with change points - sudden shifts in the
underlying data-generating process. In this paper, we propose a novel Conformal
Prediction for Time-series with Change points (CPTC) algorithm, addressing this
gap by integrating a model to predict the underlying state with online
conformal prediction to model uncertainties in non-stationary time series. We
prove CPTC's validity and improved adaptivity in the time series setting under
minimum assumptions, and demonstrate CPTC's practical effectiveness on 6
synthetic and real-world datasets, showing improved validity and adaptivity
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 现有的PDE基础模型受限于预训练数据集，在自回归推演性能（特别是分布外情况）方面表现不佳，且计算和训练数据需求大，限制了关键应用。受大语言模型'思考'策略启发，希望开发更高效的PDE求解方法。

Method: 采用测试时计算策略，使用两种奖励模型来评估基于随机模型的时空一致性预测。在PDEGym基准的可压缩欧拉方程模拟上进行验证。

Conclusion: TTC框架为PDE建模中更先进的推理算法奠定了基础，包括构建基于强化学习的方法，有望改变物理和工程领域的计算工作流程。

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are the bedrock for modern
computational sciences and engineering, and inherently computationally
expensive. While PDE foundation models have shown much promise for simulating
such complex spatio-temporal phenomena, existing models remain constrained by
the pretraining datasets and struggle with auto-regressive rollout performance,
especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. Furthermore, they have
significant compute and training data requirements which hamper their use in
many critical applications. Inspired by recent advances in ``thinking"
strategies used in large language models (LLMs), we introduce the first
test-time computing (TTC) strategy for PDEs that utilizes computational
resources during inference to achieve more accurate predictions with fewer
training samples and smaller models. We accomplish this with two types of
reward models that evaluate predictions of a stochastic based model for
spatio-temporal consistency. We demonstrate this method on compressible
Euler-equation simulations from the PDEGym benchmark and show that TTC captures
improved predictions relative to standard non-adaptive auto-regressive
inference. This TTC framework marks a foundational step towards more advanced
reasoning algorithms or PDE modeling, inluding building
reinforcement-learning-based approaches, potentially transforming computational
workflows in physics and engineering.

Abstract: The necessary integration of renewable energy sources, combined with the
expanding scale of power networks, presents significant challenges in
controlling modern power grids. Traditional control systems, which are human
and optimization-based, struggle to adapt and to scale in such an evolving
context, motivating the exploration of more dynamic and distributed control
strategies. This work advances a graph-based distributed reinforcement learning
framework for real-time, scalable grid management. The proposed architecture
consists of a network of distributed low-level agents acting on individual
power lines and coordinated by a high-level manager agent. A Graph Neural
Network (GNN) is employed to encode the network's topological information
within the single low-level agent's observation. To accelerate convergence and
enhance learning stability, the framework integrates imitation learning and
potential-based reward shaping. In contrast to conventional decentralized
approaches that decompose only the action space while relying on global
observations, this method also decomposes the observation space. Each low-level
agent acts based on a structured and informative local view of the environment
constructed through the GNN. Experiments on the Grid2Op simulation environment
show the effectiveness of the approach, which consistently outperforms the
standard baseline commonly adopted in the field. Additionally, the proposed
model proves to be much more computationally efficient than the
simulation-based Expert method.

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a critical challenge in machine learning (ML),
particularly in the medical domain, where underrepresented minority classes
lead to biased models and reduced predictive performance. This study introduces
Quantum-Inspired SMOTE (QI-SMOTE), a novel data augmentation technique that
enhances the performance of ML classifiers, including Random Forest (RF),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors
(KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Neural Networks, by leveraging quantum
principles such as quantum evolution and layered entanglement. Unlike
conventional oversampling methods, QI-SMOTE generates synthetic instances that
preserve complex data structures, improving model generalization and
classification accuracy. We validate QI-SMOTE on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV
datasets, using mortality detection as a benchmark task due to their clinical
significance and inherent class imbalance. We compare our method against
traditional oversampling techniques, including Borderline-SMOTE, ADASYN,
SMOTE-ENN, SMOTE-TOMEK, and SVM-SMOTE, using key performance metrics such as
Accuracy, F1-score, G-Mean, and AUC-ROC. The results demonstrate that QI-SMOTE
significantly improves the effectiveness of ensemble methods (RF, GB, ADA),
kernel-based models (SVM), and deep learning approaches by producing more
informative and balanced training data. By integrating quantum-inspired
transformations into the ML pipeline, QI-SMOTE not only mitigates class
imbalance but also enhances the robustness and reliability of predictive models
in medical diagnostics and decision-making. This study highlights the potential
of quantum-inspired resampling techniques in advancing state-of-the-art ML
methodologies.

Conclusion: SBICE为不确定性下的因果基准测试提供了一种稳健且数据一致的方法。

Abstract: Generating synthetic datasets that accurately reflect real-world
observational data is critical for evaluating causal estimators, but remains a
challenging task. Existing generative methods offer a solution by producing
synthetic datasets anchored in the observed data (source data) while allowing
variation in key parameters such as the treatment effect and amount of
confounding bias. However, existing methods typically require users to provide
point estimates of such parameters (rather than distributions) and fixed
estimates (rather than estimates that can be improved with reference to the
source data). This denies users the ability to express uncertainty over
parameter values and removes the potential for posterior inference, potentially
leading to unreliable estimator comparisons. We introduce simulation-based
inference for causal evaluation (SBICE), a framework that models generative
parameters as uncertain and infers their posterior distribution given a source
dataset. Leveraging techniques in simulation-based inference, SBICE identifies
parameter configurations that produce synthetic datasets closely aligned with
the source data distribution. Empirical results demonstrate that SBICE improves
the reliability of estimator evaluations by generating more realistic datasets,
which supports a robust and data-consistent approach to causal benchmarking
under uncertainty.

Abstract: Detecting elephants through seismic signals is an emerging research topic
aimed at developing solutions for Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC). Despite the
promising results, such solutions heavily rely on manual classification of
elephant footfalls, which limits their applicability for real-time
classification in natural settings. To address this limitation and build on our
previous work, this study introduces a classification framework targeting
resource-constrained implementations, prioritizing both accuracy and
computational efficiency. As part of this framework, a novel event detection
technique named Contextually Customized Windowing (CCW), tailored specifically
for detecting elephant footfalls, was introduced, and evaluations were
conducted by comparing it with the Short-Term Average/Long-Term Average
(STA/LTA) method. The yielded results show that the maximum validated detection
range was 155.6 m in controlled conditions and 140 m in natural environments.
Elephant footfall classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a
Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel demonstrated superior performance across
multiple settings, achieving an accuracy of 99% in controlled environments, 73%
in natural elephant habitats, and 70% in HEC-prone human habitats, the most
challenging scenario. Furthermore, feature impact analysis using explainable AI
identified the number of Zero Crossings and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
Alignment Cost as the most influential factors in all experiments, while
Predominant Frequency exhibited significant influence in controlled settings.

Abstract: Offloading footwear helps prevent and treat diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) by
lowering plantar pressure (PP), yet prescription decisions remain fragmented:
feature selection varies, personalization is limited, and evaluation practices
differ. We performed a narrative review of 45 studies (12 guidelines/protocols,
25 knowledge-based systems, 8 machine-learning applications) published to Aug
2025. We thematically analyzed knowledge type, decision logic, evaluation
methods, and enabling technologies. Guidelines emphasize PP thresholds (<=200
kPa or >=25--30\% reduction) but rarely yield actionable, feature-level
outputs. Knowledge-based systems use rule- and sensor-driven logic, integrating
PP monitoring, adherence tracking, and usability testing. ML work introduces
predictive, optimization, and generative models with high computational
accuracy but limited explainability and clinical validation. Evaluation remains
fragmented: protocols prioritize biomechanical tests; knowledge-based systems
assess usability/adherence; ML studies focus on technical accuracy with weak
linkage to long-term outcomes. From this synthesis we propose a five-part CDSS
framework: (1) a minimum viable dataset; (2) a hybrid architecture combining
rules, optimization, and explainable ML; (3) structured feature-level outputs;
(4) continuous validation and evaluation; and (5) integration with clinical and
telehealth workflows. This framework aims to enable scalable, patient-centered
CDSSs for DFU care; prioritizing interoperable datasets, explainable models,
and outcome-focused evaluation will be key to clinical adoption.

Abstract: Ensemble method is considered the gold standard for uncertainty
quantification (UQ) for machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs).
However, their high computational cost can limit its practicality. Alternative
techniques, such as Monte Carlo dropout and deep kernel learning, have been
proposed to improve computational efficiency; however, some of these methods
cannot be applied to already trained models and may affect the prediction
accuracy. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient post-hoc framework
for UQ that leverages the descriptor of a trained graph neural network
potential to estimate residual errors. We refer to this method as post-hoc
descriptor-based residual-based learning (PDRL). PDRL models the discrepancy
between MLIP predictions and ground truth values, allowing these residuals to
act as proxies for prediction uncertainty. We explore multiple variants of PDRL
and benchmark them against established UQ methods, evaluating both their
effectiveness and limitations.

Abstract: In self-supervised reinforcement learning (RL), one of the key challenges is
learning a diverse set of skills to prepare agents for unknown future tasks.
Despite impressive advances, scalability and evaluation remain prevalent
issues. Regarding scalability, the search for meaningful skills can be obscured
by high-dimensional feature spaces, where relevant features may vary across
downstream task domains. For evaluating skill diversity, defining what
constitutes "diversity" typically requires a hard commitment to a specific
notion of what it means for skills to be diverse, potentially leading to
inconsistencies in how skill diversity is understood, making results across
different approaches hard to compare, and leaving many forms of diversity
unexplored. To address these issues, we adopt a measure of sample diversity
that translates ideas from ecology to machine learning -- the Vendi Score --
allowing the user to specify and evaluate any desired form of diversity. We
demonstrate how this metric facilitates skill evaluation and introduce VendiRL,
a unified framework for learning diversely diverse sets of skills. Given
distinct similarity functions, VendiRL motivates distinct forms of diversity,
which could support skill-diversity pretraining in new and richly interactive
environments where optimising for various forms of diversity may be desirable.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络在频谱分析中面临挑战，特别是处理非周期信号（如不可通约频率信号）时，传统ARIMA模型往往优于神经网络和大语言模型。

Method: 提出Autoregressive-Weight-Enhanced AR-KAN混合模型，利用通用近视映射定理，使用KAN网络处理静态非线性部分，并通过预训练的自回归组件引入记忆机制，保留有用信息并消除冗余。

Result: 实验数据显示，AR-KAN在72%的真实世界数据集上提供了优越的结果。

Conclusion: AR-KAN模型成功解决了传统神经网络在非周期信号分析中的局限性，通过结合KAN网络和自回归方法的优势，在频谱分析任务中取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Conventional neural networks frequently face challenges in spectral analysis
of signals. To address this challenge, Fourier neural networks (FNNs) and
similar approaches integrate components of Fourier series into the structure of
neural networks. Nonetheless, a significant hurdle is often overlooked: the
superposition of periodic signals does not necessarily result in a periodic
signal. For example, when forecasting almost periodic functions composed of
signals with incommensurate frequencies, traditional models such as
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) frequently outperform most
neural networks including large language models (LLMs). To tackle this goal, we
propose Autoregressive-Weight-Enhanced AR-KAN, a hybrid model that combines the
benefits of both methods. Using the Universal Myopic Mapping Theorem, we apply
a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for the static nonlinear part and include
memory through a pre-trained AR component, which can be explained to retain the
most useful information while eliminating redundancy. Experimental data
indicates that AR-KAN delivers superior results on $72\%$ of real-world
datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出D-Byz-SGDM方法，通过延迟动量聚合解决联邦学习中部分参与场景下的拜占庭攻击问题，在理论和实验上都证明了有效性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有拜占庭鲁棒联邦学习方法假设全客户端参与，但在实际通信约束和客户端可用性下只能部分参与，当采样客户端包含拜占庭多数时会立即失效

Method: 引入延迟动量聚合原则，服务器聚合非参与客户端的最新接收梯度与活跃客户端的实时动量，实现D-Byz-SGDM优化器

Result: 建立了收敛保证，恢复了全参与结果并匹配部分参与设置的下界，深度学习实验验证了在各种拜占庭攻击下的稳定鲁棒训练

Conclusion: 延迟动量聚合是解决部分参与联邦学习中拜占庭攻击的有效方法，理论分析和实验验证都证明了其优越性能

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows distributed model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy, but it remains vulnerable to Byzantine
clients that exhibit malicious behavior. While existing Byzantine-robust FL
methods provide strong convergence guarantees (e.g., to a stationary point in
expectation) under Byzantine attacks, they typically assume full client
participation, which is unrealistic due to communication constraints and client
availability. Under partial participation, existing methods fail immediately
after the sampled clients contain a Byzantine majority, creating a fundamental
challenge for sparse communication. First, we introduce delayed momentum
aggregation, a novel principle where the server aggregates the most recently
received gradients from non-participating clients alongside fresh momentum from
active clients. Our optimizer D-Byz-SGDM (Delayed Byzantine-robust SGD with
Momentum) implements this delayed momentum aggregation principle for
Byzantine-robust FL with partial participation. Then, we establish convergence
guarantees that recover previous full participation results and match the
fundamental lower bounds we prove for the partial participation setting.
Experiments on deep learning tasks validated our theoretical findings, showing
stable and robust training under various Byzantine attacks.

TL;DR: AdaGO结合正交化动量更新和AdaGrad型自适应步长，在保持正交更新方向的同时通过累积梯度范数自适应调整步长，理论收敛性得到保证，实验表现优于Muon和Adam。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器通过正交化动量更新权重矩阵，在大语言模型训练中表现优异，但缺乏确定学习率的方法。AdaGrad作为广泛使用的自适应方法，通过累积历史梯度缩放步长。需要结合两者的优势。

Method: 提出AdaGO算法，将基于范数的AdaGrad型步长与正交化更新方向结合。保持更新方向的正交性（可解释为谱下降方向），同时通过累积梯度范数缩放方向来自适应调整步长。实现只需在Muon基础上增加一个标量变量（累积平方梯度范数）。

Result: 在非凸函数的随机和确定性设置下，在标准光滑性和无偏有界方差噪声假设下建立了最优理论收敛率。在CIFAR-10分类和函数回归任务上的实验结果表明，AdaGO优于Muon和Adam。

Conclusion: AdaGO成功结合了正交化更新和自适应步长的优势，既保持了Muon的正交性特性，又获得了AdaGrad的自适应能力，在理论和实验上都表现出色。

Abstract: The recently proposed Muon optimizer updates weight matrices via
orthogonalized momentum and has demonstrated strong empirical success in large
language model training. However, it remains unclear how to determine the
learning rates for such orthogonalized updates. AdaGrad, by contrast, is a
widely used adaptive method that scales stochastic gradients by accumulated
past gradients. We propose a new algorithm, AdaGO, which combines a norm-based
AdaGrad-type stepsize with an orthogonalized update direction, bringing
together the benefits of both approaches. Unlike other adaptive variants of
Muon, AdaGO preserves the orthogonality of the update direction, which can be
interpreted as a spectral descent direction, while adapting the stepsizes to
the optimization landscape by scaling the direction with accumulated past
gradient norms. The implementation of AdaGO requires only minimal modification
to Muon, with a single additional scalar variable, the accumulated squared
gradient norms, to be computed, making it computationally and memory efficient.
Optimal theoretical convergence rates are established for nonconvex functions
in both stochastic and deterministic settings under standard smoothness and
unbiased bounded-variance noise assumptions. Empirical results on CIFAR-10
classification and function regression demonstrate that AdaGO outperforms Muon
and Adam.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 睡眠分期模型在面对未见过的生理特征或记录条件时性能会下降，需要一种无需源数据或患者校准的实用自适应方法。

Method: 流式无源测试时自适应方法，结合熵最小化(Tent)、批归一化统计刷新，以及两个安全机制：熵门控(暂停不确定窗口的适应)和EMA重置(防止漂移)。

Result: 在Sleep-EDF Expanded数据集上，使用单导联EEG数据，相比冻结基线模型在秒级延迟和最小内存消耗下获得一致性能提升，报告了各阶段指标和Cohen's k。

Conclusion: 该方法模型无关，无需源数据或患者校准，适用于设备端或床旁使用，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Sleep staging models often degrade when deployed on patients with unseen
physiology or recording conditions. We propose a streaming, source-free
test-time adaptation (TTA) recipe that combines entropy minimization (Tent)
with Batch-Norm statistic refresh and two safety rails: an entropy gate to
pause adaptation on uncertain windows and an EMA-based reset to reel back
drift. On Sleep-EDF Expanded, using single-lead EEG (Fpz-Cz, 100 Hz, 30s
epochs; R&K to AASM mapping), we show consistent gains over a frozen baseline
at seconds-level latency and minimal memory, reporting per-stage metrics and
Cohen's k. The method is model-agnostic, requires no source data or patient
calibration, and is practical for on-device or bedside use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决增材制造中实时监测的挑战：X射线成像成本高且不实用，而光电二极管吸收率数据虽然成本低但噪声大，单独使用时预测精度不足。

Method: 使用多模态学习框架，结合CNN提取X射线空间特征和RNN提取吸收率时序特征，采用早期融合策略，并通过迁移学习微调RNN模型。

Result: 多模态训练显著提高了预测精度，训练后的模型仅使用吸收率数据就能准确推断熔池特性，无需昂贵X射线成像。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了成本效益高的实时监测，在增材制造领域具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: While multiple sensors are used for real-time monitoring in additive
manufacturing, not all provide practical or reliable process insights. For
example, high-speed X-ray imaging offers valuable spatial information about
subsurface melt pool behavior but is costly and impractical for most industrial
settings. In contrast, absorptivity data from low-cost photodiodes correlate
with melt pool dynamics but is often too noisy for accurate prediction when
used alone. In this paper, we propose a multimodal data fusion approach for
predicting melt pool dynamics by combining high-fidelity X-ray data with
low-fidelity absorptivity data in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process.
Our multimodal learning framework integrates convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) for spatial feature extraction from X-ray data with recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) for temporal feature extraction from absorptivity signals,
using an early fusion strategy. The multimodal model is further used as a
transfer learning model to fine-tune the RNN model that can predict melt pool
dynamics only with absorptivity, with greater accuracy compared to the
multimodal model. Results show that training with both modalities significantly
improves prediction accuracy compared to using either modality alone.
Furthermore, once trained, the model can infer melt pool characteristics using
only absorptivity data, eliminating the need for expensive X-ray imaging. This
multimodal fusion approach enables cost-effective, real-time monitoring and has
broad applicability in additive manufacturing.

Result: 在7个典型示例上进行数值实验，证明该算法在收敛性能方面显示出优于最先进算法，特别是一种人口依赖策略的虚拟对局版本，并在共同噪声环境下体现了稳健性和适应性

Conclusion: 该算法为学习坎衡提供了一种高效、稳健的方法，能够适应不同初始分布和噪声条件，在实际应用中具有重要价值

Abstract: Mean Field Games (MFGs) offer a powerful framework for studying large-scale
multi-agent systems. Yet, learning Nash equilibria in MFGs remains a
challenging problem, particularly when the initial distribution is unknown or
when the population is subject to common noise. In this paper, we introduce an
efficient deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm designed to achieve
population-dependent Nash equilibria without relying on averaging or historical
sampling, inspired by Munchausen RL and Online Mirror Descent. The resulting
policy is adaptable to various initial distributions and sources of common
noise. Through numerical experiments on seven canonical examples, we
demonstrate that our algorithm exhibits superior convergence properties
compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly a DRL version of
Fictitious Play for population-dependent policies. The performance in the
presence of common noise underscores the robustness and adaptability of our
approach.

Conclusion: LLMs可以有效自动化领域知识整合过程，使物理信息符号回归更加易于使用和有效，为科学发现提供了有前景的工具。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) has emerged as a powerful tool for automated
scientific discovery, enabling the derivation of governing equations from
experimental data. A growing body of work illustrates the promise of
integrating domain knowledge into the SR to improve the discovered equation's
generality and usefulness. Physics-informed SR (PiSR) addresses this by
incorporating domain knowledge, but current methods often require specialized
formulations and manual feature engineering, limiting their adaptability only
to domain experts. In this study, we leverage pre-trained Large Language Models
(LLMs) to facilitate knowledge integration in PiSR. By harnessing the
contextual understanding of LLMs trained on vast scientific literature, we aim
to automate the incorporation of domain knowledge, reducing the need for manual
intervention and making the process more accessible to a broader range of
scientific problems. Namely, the LLM is integrated into the SR's loss function,
adding a term of the LLM's evaluation of the SR's produced equation. We
extensively evaluate our method using three SR algorithms (DEAP, gplearn, and
PySR) and three pre-trained LLMs (Falcon, Mistral, and LLama 2) across three
physical dynamics (dropping ball, simple harmonic motion, and electromagnetic
wave). The results demonstrate that LLM integration consistently improves the
reconstruction of physical dynamics from data, enhancing the robustness of SR
models to noise and complexity. We further explore the impact of prompt
engineering, finding that more informative prompts significantly improve
performance.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的二进制量化方法，通过动态选择最优子矩阵和适应性分组策略，在仅1.007比特平均长度下实现了接近原始模型的性能，超越了之前的二进制量化方法并与4毕特方法竞争。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型需要大量内存和计算资源，二进制量化可以大幅减少存储和推理成本，但传统二进制量化导致显著的性能下降。

Method: 提出了一种专门为二进制量化设计的新题优化目标，以及三种实现该目标的算法。通过动态识别最优的非结构化子矩阵，使用适应性分组策略来改善块量化。

Result: 平均比特长度仅1.007比特，LLaMA 3.2 3B模型的困惑度从原始的7.81降至8.23，显著超越之前的BiLLM方法（困惑度123.90），与GPTQ等4毕特方法竞争。量化过程高效，单CPU核心14秒完成LLaMA 3.2 3B权重量化，整体过程小于100分钟。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高模型质量的同时实现了极其高效的二进制压缩，为大语言模型的轻量级部署提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but require
substantial memory and computational resources. Binary quantization, which
compresses model weights from 16-bit Brain Float to 1-bit representations in
{-1, 1}, offers significant reductions in storage and inference costs. However,
such aggressive quantization often leads to notable performance degradation
compared to more conservative 4-bit quantization methods. In this research, we
propose a novel optimization objective tailored for binary quantization, along
with three algorithms designed to realize it effectively. Our method enhances
blocked quantization by dynamically identifying optimal unstructured
sub-matrices through adaptive grouping strategies. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves an average bit length of just 1.007
bits, while maintaining high model quality. Specifically, our quantized LLaMA
3.2 3B model attains a perplexity of 8.23, remarkably close to the original
7.81, and surpasses previous SOTA BiLLM with a perplexity of only 123.90.
Furthermore, our method is competitive with SOTA 4-bit approaches such as GPTQ
in both performance and efficiency. The compression process is highly
efficient, requiring only 14 seconds to quantize the full LLaMA 3.2 3B weights
on a single CPU core, with the entire process completing in under 100 minutes
and exhibiting embarrassingly parallel properties.

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个通过离散功能几何分析ReLU网络的统一框架，为理解、诊断和改进泛化能力提供了新工具。

Abstract: We extend the ReLU Transition Graph (RTG) framework into a comprehensive
graph-theoretic model for understanding deep ReLU networks. In this model, each
node represents a linear activation region, and edges connect regions that
differ by a single ReLU activation flip, forming a discrete geometric structure
over the network's functional behavior. We prove that RTGs at random
initialization exhibit strong expansion, binomial degree distributions, and
spectral properties that tightly govern generalization. These structural
insights enable new bounds on capacity via region entropy and on generalization
via spectral gap and edge-wise KL divergence. Empirically, we construct RTGs
for small networks, measure their smoothness and connectivity properties, and
validate theoretical predictions. Our results show that region entropy
saturates under overparameterization, spectral gap correlates with
generalization, and KL divergence across adjacent regions reflects functional
smoothness. This work provides a unified framework for analyzing ReLU networks
through the lens of discrete functional geometry, offering new tools to
understand, diagnose, and improve generalization.

Abstract: We argue that progress toward general intelligence requires complementary
foundation models grounded in language, the physical world, and structured
data. This report presents LimiX, the first installment of our large
structured-data models (LDMs). LimiX treats structured data as a joint
distribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide
range of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single
model. LimiX is pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an
episodic, context-conditional objective, where the model predicts for query
subsets conditioned on dataset-specific contexts, supporting rapid,
training-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX across 10 large
structured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature
dimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio,
missingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. With a single model and a unified
interface, LimiX consistently surpasses strong baselines including
gradient-boosting trees, deep tabular networks, recent tabular foundation
models, and automated ensembles, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The
superiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification,
regression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial
margins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per
task. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that their
reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR), particularly in domains like
mathematics and programming, where ground-truth correctness can be
automatically evaluated. However, extending this success to other
reasoning-intensive domains remains challenging due to the scarcity of
high-quality, verifiable datasets and the high cost of human supervision. In
this work, we introduce the Loong Project: an open-source framework for
scalable synthetic data generation and verification across a diverse range of
reasoning-intensive domains. The framework consists of two key components: (1)
LoongBench, a curated seed dataset containing 8,729 human-vetted examples
across 12 domains (e.g., Advanced Mathematics, Chemistry, Logic), each paired
with executable code and rich metadata; and (2) LoongEnv, a modular synthetic
data generation environment that supports multiple prompting strategies to
produce new question-answer-code triples. Together, these components form an
agent-environment loop that enables reinforcement learning, where an LLM-based
agent is rewarded for generating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) solutions that align
with code-executed answers. Empirically, we benchmark LoongBench on a broad
suite of both open-source and proprietary LLMs to evaluate domain coverage and
reveal performance bottlenecks. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis of synthetic data generated by LoongEnv, examining correctness,
difficulty, and diversity. Code and documentation are available at

Motivation: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)虽然能通过最小化损失和锐度来改善深度神经网络的泛化能力，但在分布式大批次训练中存在效率低下的问题

Method: LSAM将SAM的对抗步骤与异步分布式采样策略相结合，生成异步分布式采样方案，产生平滑的锐度感知损失景观进行优化

inefficiency in distributed large-batch training. We present Landscape-Smoothed
SAM (LSAM), a novel optimizer that preserves SAM's generalization advantages
while offering superior efficiency. LSAM integrates SAM's adversarial steps
with an asynchronous distributed sampling strategy, generating an asynchronous
distributed sampling scheme, producing a smoothed sharpness-aware loss
landscape for optimization. This design eliminates synchronization bottlenecks,
accelerates large-batch convergence, and delivers higher final accuracy
compared to data-parallel SAM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DRL交通信号控制存在两种策略：选择相位策略可能导致不可预测的相位序列影响安全，切换策略可能导致相位分配不公平和低效。需要一种既能保持可预测性又能灵活分配时间的方法。

Method: 提出Deep Hierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP)模型，采用分层控制：高层代理基于整体交通状态分配南北和东西方向的总周期时间，低层代理在每个主要方向内进一步分配直行和左转运动的持续时间。

Result: 在真实和合成的道路网络及交通流数据集上测试，DHCP模型在所有数据集上都优于基线方法，取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: DHCP通过分层周期时间分配策略，有效解决了传统DRL交通信号控制中的安全性和效率问题，实现了更灵活和公平的相位持续时间分配。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a popular approach in traffic
signal control (TSC) due to its ability to learn adaptive policies from complex
traffic environments. Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control
paradigms are ``choose phase" and ``switch" strategies. Although the agent in
the choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this
paradigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their
anticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile,
the switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next
predefined phase or extend the current phase. While this structure maintains a
more predictable order, it can lead to unfair and inefficient phase
allocations, as certain movements may be extended disproportionately while
others are neglected. In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep
Hierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle
duration hierarchically. A high-level agent first determines the split of the
total cycle time between the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions
based on the overall traffic state. Then, a low-level agent further divides the
allocated duration within each major direction between straight and left-turn
movements, enabling more flexible durations for the two movements. We test our
model on both real and synthetic road networks, along with multiple sets of
real and synthetic traffic flows. Empirical results show our model achieves the

*Li Yi,Qian Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用深度学习和数值模拟的AI框架实现了无标准的自动化TDCR多核素分析，充分解决了流动测试中标准没有或快速分析的挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统TDCR多核素分析存在的自动化程度低和依赖混合物标准的问题，特别是在标准没有或需要快速现场分析的场景下

Method: 结合Geant4模拟和统计检测器响应采样生成β谱进行模型训练，设计了专门的神经网络结构，基于各种核素混比比例和泄灭场景的数据集进行训练

Result: 模型在活度比例(均绝对误差=0.009)、检测效率(均绝对误差=0.002)和谱重建(结构相似性指数=0.9998)任务上都取得了高精度结果

Conclusion: 这种AI驱动方法具有强大的演绎能力、实时处理能力和工程可行性，在无标准物质或需要快速现场分析的场景中展示了重要潜力

Abstract: Liquid scintillation triple-to-doubly coincident ratio (TDCR) spectroscopy is
widely adopted as a standard method for radionuclide quantification because of
its inherent advantages such as high precision, self-calibrating capability,
and independence from radioactive reference sources. However, multiradionuclide
analysis via TDCR faces the challenges of limited automation and reliance on
mixture-specific standards, which may not be easily available. Here, we present
an Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework that combines numerical spectral
simulation and deep learning for standard-free automated analysis. $\beta$
spectra for model training were generated using Geant4 simulations coupled with
statistically modeled detector response sampling. A tailored neural network
architecture, trained on this dataset covering various nuclei mix ratio and
quenching scenarios, enables autonomous resolution of individual radionuclide
activities and detecting efficiency through end-to-end learning paradigms. The
model delivers consistent high accuracy across tasks: activity proportions
(mean absolute error = 0.009), detection efficiencies (mean absolute error =
0.002), and spectral reconstruction (Structural Similarity Index = 0.9998),
validating its physical plausibility for quenched $\beta$ spectroscopy. This
AI-driven methodology exhibits significant potential for automated
safety-compliant multiradionuclide analysis with robust generalization,
real-time processing capabilities, and engineering feasibility, particularly in
scenarios where reference materials are unavailable or rapid field analysis is
required.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次实证量化了自动驾驶场景中可解释AI的Rashomon效应，发现不同模型对同一预测会给出显著不同的解释，表明解释歧义是问题的固有属性而非建模缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶等安全关键应用中，可解释AI(XAI)的可靠性受到Rashomon效应的挑战——多个同等准确的模型可能对同一预测给出不同的解释。需要实证量化这种效应。

Method: 使用定性可解释图(QXGs)作为符号场景表示，训练两类Rashomon集合模型：可解释的基于对的梯度提升模型和复杂的基于图的GNN模型，通过特征归因方法测量解释的一致性。

Result: 结果显示存在显著的解释分歧，不同模型类别内部和之间的解释一致性都很低。

Conclusion: 解释歧义是动作预测问题的固有属性，而不仅仅是建模方法的产物，这对安全关键应用中XAI的可靠性提出了重要挑战。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is essential for validating and trusting models in
safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. However, the reliability
of XAI is challenged by the Rashomon effect, where multiple, equally accurate
models can offer divergent explanations for the same prediction. This paper
provides the first empirical quantification of this effect for the task of
action prediction in real-world driving scenes. Using Qualitative Explainable
Graphs (QXGs) as a symbolic scene representation, we train Rashomon sets of two
distinct model classes: interpretable, pair-based gradient boosting models and
complex, graph-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Using feature attribution
methods, we measure the agreement of explanations both within and between these
classes. Our results reveal significant explanation disagreement. Our findings
suggest that explanation ambiguity is an inherent property of the problem, not
just a modeling artifact.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个无阈值的评估框架AUC-IoU来解决归因方法评估中的阈值选择偏差问题，通过在完整阈值谱上计算性能来提供可靠的比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的归因方法评估存在阈值选择偏差，单一阈值选择可以改变方法排名超过200个百分点，这削弱了评估结论的可靠性。

Method: 开发了阈值无关的AUC-IoU框架，在完整阈值范围内计算曲线下面积来评估归因质量，避免了单一阈值选择带来的偏差。

Result: 在皮肤镜图像上评估7种归因方法，发现单一阈值指标产生矛盾结果，而无阈值评估能可靠区分方法性能。XRAI比LIME提升31%，比普通积分梯度提升204%，不同病灶尺寸的性能差异达269%。

Conclusion: 该框架消除了评估伪影，为医学影像及其他领域的归因方法选择提供了理论基础和实践指导，建立了方法学标准。

Abstract: Attribution methods explain neural network predictions by identifying
influential input features, but their evaluation suffers from threshold
selection bias that can reverse method rankings and undermine conclusions.
Current protocols binarize attribution maps at single thresholds, where
threshold choice alone can alter rankings by over 200 percentage points. We
address this flaw with a threshold-free framework that computes Area Under the
Curve for Intersection over Union (AUC-IoU), capturing attribution quality
across the full threshold spectrum. Evaluating seven attribution methods on
dermatological imaging, we show single-threshold metrics yield contradictory
results, while threshold-free evaluation provides reliable differentiation.
XRAI achieves 31% improvement over LIME and 204% over vanilla Integrated
Gradients, with size-stratified analysis revealing performance variations up to
269% across lesion scales. These findings establish methodological standards
that eliminate evaluation artifacts and enable evidence-based method selection.
The threshold-free framework provides both theoretical insight into attribution
behavior and practical guidance for robust comparison in medical imaging and
beyond.

TL;DR: 基于TabPFN模型的地质特征化新方法，在空间剪切强度预测和参数捕充任务中超越传统法，实现了更高准确性和更快的推理速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索基础模型TabPFN在地质工程预测任务中的应用潜力，解决传统分层贝叶斯模型在准确性和效率方面的局限性

Method: 采用TabPFN模型进行零训练、少样本、上下文学习，结合大间接数据库(BID)提供额外上下文信息，无需调参

Result: 在空间剪切强度预测任务中，TabPFN超过HBM基准模型的预测准确性，运行时间提升一个数量级；在参数捕充任务中，所有目标参数的RMSE都更低且不确定性良好量化

Conclusion: TabPFN作为通用基础模型，在地质工程预测中表现优异，为概率性地质特征化带来潜在的范式转变

Abstract: This paper presents a novel application of the Tabular Prior-Data Fitted
Network (TabPFN) - a transformer-based foundation model for tabular data - to
geotechnical site characterization problems defined in the GEOAI benchmark
BM/AirportSoilProperties/2/2025. Two tasks are addressed: (1) predicting the
spatial variation of undrained shear strength (su) across borehole depth
profiles, and (2) imputing missing mechanical parameters in a dense-site
dataset. We apply TabPFN in a zero-training, few-shot, in-context learning
setting - without hyper-parameter tuning - and provide it with additional
context from the big indirect database (BID). The study demonstrates that
TabPFN, as a general-purpose foundation model, achieved superior accuracy and
well-calibrated predictive distributions compared to a conventional
hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) baseline, while also offering significant
gains in inference efficiency. In Benchmark Problem #1 (spatial su prediction),
TabPFN outperformed the HBM in prediction accuracy and delivered an
order-of-magnitude faster runtime. In Benchmark Problem #2 (missing mechanical
parameter imputation), TabPFN likewise achieved lower RMSE for all target
parameters with well-quantified uncertainties, though its cumulative
computation cost was higher than HBM's due to its one-variable-at-a-time
inference. These results mark the first successful use of a tabular foundation
model in geotechnical modeling, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in
probabilistic site characterization.

Method: 提出了三种不同的设计方案：(i)使用y和s的综合目标函数构建单树；(ii)使用y目标函数并添加s约束；(iii)构建两个独立树Ty和Ts，分别预测y和s。本文重点研究了前两种未经充分探索的方法。

Result: 通过在多个数据集上的实验对比，对不同设计方案进行了实验特征化分析，评估了各方案在预测性能和公平性保障方面的表现。

Conclusion: 本文扩展了公平性决策树的设计空间，为建模者提供了更多的设计选择。实验结果显示了不同方案在平衡预测准确性和公平性时的各自优势，为实际应用提供了实证指南。

Abstract: Decision trees have been studied extensively in the context of fairness,
aiming to maximize prediction performance while ensuring non-discrimination
against different groups. Techniques in this space usually focus on imposing
constraints at training time, constraining the search space so that solutions
which display unacceptable values of relevant metrics are not considered,
discarded, or discouraged. If we assume one target variable y and one sensitive
attribute s, the design space of tree learning algorithms can be spanned as
follows: (i) One can have one tree T that is built using an objective function
that is a function of y, s, and T. For instance, one can build a tree based on
the weighted information gain regarding y (maximizing) and s (minimizing). (ii)
The second option is to have one tree model T that uses an objective function
in y and T and a constraint on s and T. Here, s is no longer part of the
objective, but part of a constraint. This can be achieved greedily by aborting
a further split as soon as the condition that optimizes the objective in y
fails to satisfy the constraint on s. A simple way to explore other splits is
to backtrack during tree construction once a fairness constraint is violated.
(iii) The third option is to have two trees T_y and T_s, one for y and one for
s, such that the tree structure for y and s does not have to be shared. In this
way, information regarding y and regarding s can be used independently, without
having to constrain the choices in tree construction by the mutual information
between the two variables. Quite surprisingly, of the three options, only the
first one and the greedy variant of the second have been studied in the
literature so far. In this paper, we introduce the above two additional options
from that design space and characterize them experimentally on multiple
datasets.

<details>

Motivation: 解决GCSL框架的两个主要限制：1)仅从自生成经验学习会加剧智能体固有偏见；2)目标重标注策略使智能体只关注成功结果，无法从错误中学习

Method: 将对比学习原理整合到GCSL框架中，使智能体能够同时从成功和失败的经验中学习

Result: 通过实证评估表明，该算法克服了智能体初始偏见的限制，实现了更强的探索行为，促进了有效策略的识别和采用

Conclusion: 该方法在各种挑战性环境中实现了优越的性能表现，为稀疏奖励环境下的强化学习提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Reinforcement learning faces significant challenges when applied to tasks
characterized by sparse reward structures. Although imitation learning, within
the domain of supervised learning, offers faster convergence, it relies heavily
on human-generated demonstrations. Recently, Goal-Conditioned Supervised
Learning (GCSL) has emerged as a potential solution by enabling self-imitation
learning for autonomous systems. By strategically relabelling goals, agents can
derive policy insights from their own experiences. Despite the successes of
this framework, it presents two notable limitations: (1) Learning exclusively
from self-generated experiences can exacerbate the agents' inherent biases; (2)
The relabelling strategy allows agents to focus solely on successful outcomes,
precluding them from learning from their mistakes. To address these issues, we
propose a novel model that integrates contrastive learning principles into the
GCSL framework to learn from both success and failure. Through empirical
evaluations, we demonstrate that our algorithm overcomes limitations imposed by
agents' initial biases and thereby enables more exploratory behavior. This
facilitates the identification and adoption of effective policies, leading to
superior performance across a variety of challenging environments.

TL;DR: TeRA是一种新颖的参数高效微调方法，通过张量网络实现高秩权重更新，同时保持向量化方法的参数效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有LoRA风格适配器在模型表达性和参数效率之间的权衡问题，高秩适配器需要更多参数，而向量化方法参数效率高但表达性有限

Method: 使用Tucker-like张量网络参数化权重更新矩阵，冻结大型随机初始化因子并在层间共享，仅训练由对角因子矩阵条目组成的小型层特定缩放向量

Result: TeRA匹配甚至超越高秩适配器性能，同时所需可训练参数数量与向量化方法相当

Conclusion: TeRA成功实现了高秩权重更新与参数效率的平衡，理论分析和消融研究验证了方法的有效性

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), have significantly reduced the number of trainable parameters needed in
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Subsequent developments of LoRA-style
adapters have diverged into two main directions: (1) enhancing model
expressivity with high-rank adapters, and (2) pushing for further parameter
reduction, as exemplified by vector-based methods. However, these approaches
present a trade-off, as achieving the expressivity of high-rank weight updates
typically comes at the cost of sacrificing the extreme parameter efficiency
offered by vector-based techniques. To address this issue, we propose a
vector-based random \underline{\textbf{Te}}nsor network for
high-\underline{\textbf{R}}ank \underline{\textbf{A}}daptation (TeRA), a novel
PEFT method that achieves high-rank weight updates while retaining the
parameter efficiency of vector-based PEFT adapters. This is achieved by
parameterizing the tensorized weight update matrix as a Tucker-like tensor
network (TN), in which large randomly initialized factors are frozen and shared
across layers, while only small layer-specific scaling vectors, formed by
entries in diagonal factor matrices, are trained. This design effectively
decouples the rank of the weight update matrix from the number of trainable
parameters. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TeRA matches or even
outperforms high-rank adapters, while requiring a trainable parameter count
similar to vector-based methods. Theoretical analysis and ablation studies
further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Method: 提出窗口基于F1指标F1$_w$，包含时间宽容度，在三个生理数据集上进行实验分析，包括两个生活环境数据集和一个实验室数据集

Result: F1$_w$能够显示传统指标无法发现的有意义模型性能模式，在生活环境应用中显示出统计上显著的性能收益

Conclusion: 评估指标的选择强烈影响对模型性能的解释，F1$_w$为健康管理应用提供了更加健壮的评估方法

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of event detection in time series is essential for
applications such as stress monitoring with wearable devices, where ground
truth is typically annotated as single-point events, even though the underlying
phenomena are gradual and temporally diffused. Standard metrics like F1 and
point-adjusted F1 (F1$_{pa}$) often misrepresent model performance in such
real-world, imbalanced datasets. We introduce a window-based F1 metric (F1$_w$)
that incorporates temporal tolerance, enabling a more robust assessment of
event detection when exact alignment is unrealistic. Empirical analysis in
three physiological datasets, two in-the-wild (ADARP, Wrist Angel) and one
experimental (ROAD), indicates that F1$_w$ reveals meaningful model performance
patterns invisible to conventional metrics, while its window size can be
adapted to domain knowledge to avoid overestimation. We show that the choice of
evaluation metric strongly influences the interpretation of model performance:
using predictions from TimesFM, only our temporally tolerant metrics reveal
statistically significant improvements over random and null baselines in the
two in-the-wild use cases. This work addresses key gaps in time series
evaluation and provides practical guidance for healthcare applications where
requirements for temporal precision vary by context.

Abstract: The increasing demand for high data rates and seamless connectivity in
wireless systems has sparked significant interest in reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces (RIS) and artificial intelligence-based wireless applications. RIS
typically comprises passive reflective antenna elements that control the
wireless propagation environment by adequately tuning the phase of the
reflective elements. The allocation of RIS elements to multipleuser equipment
(UEs) is crucial for efficiently utilizing RIS. In this work, we formulate a
joint optimization problem that optimizes the RIS phase configuration and
resource allocation under an $\alpha$-fair scheduling framework and propose an
efficient way of allocating RIS elements. Conventional iterative optimization
methods, however, suffer from exponentially increasing computational complexity
as the number of RIS elements increases and also complicate the generation of
training labels for supervised learning. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a five-layer fully connected neural network (FNN) combined with a
preprocessing technique to significantly reduce input dimensionality, lower
computational complexity, and enhance scalability. The simulation results show
that our proposed NN-based solution reduces computational overhead while
significantly improving system throughput by 6.8% compared to existing RIS
element allocation schemes. Furthermore, the proposed system achieves better
performance while reducing computational complexity, making it significantly
more scalable than the iterative optimization algorithms.

Conclusion: TopoMap提供了一种有效的方法来系统性地探索深度学习模型的故障特征空间，能够识别不同的故障模式区域，为深度学习测试提供了新的视角和工具。

Abstract: Testing Deep Learning (DL)-based systems is an open challenge. Although it is
relatively easy to find inputs that cause a DL model to misbehave, the grouping
of inputs by features that make the DL model under test fail is largely
unexplored. Existing approaches for DL testing introduce perturbations that may
focus on specific failure-inducing features, while neglecting others that
belong to different regions of the feature space. In this paper, we create an
explicit topographical map of the input feature space. Our approach, named
TopoMap, is both black-box and model-agnostic as it relies solely on features
that characterise the input space. To discriminate the inputs according to the
specific features they share, we first apply dimensionality reduction to obtain
input embeddings, which are then subjected to clustering. Each DL model might
require specific embedding computations and clustering algorithms to achieve a
meaningful separation of inputs into discriminative groups. We propose a novel
way to evaluate alternative configurations of embedding and clustering
techniques. We used a deep neural network (DNN) as an approximation of a human
evaluator who could tell whether a pair of clusters can be discriminated based
on the features of the included elements. We use such a DNN to automatically
select the optimal topographical map of the inputs among all those that are
produced by different embedding/clustering configurations. The evaluation
results show that the maps generated by TopoMap consist of distinguishable and
meaningful regions. In addition, we evaluate the effectiveness of TopoMap using
mutation analysis. In particular, we assess whether the clusters in our
topographical map allow for an effective selection of mutation-killing inputs.
Experimental results show that our approach outperforms random selection by 35%
on average on killable mutants; by 61% on non-killable ones.

Abstract: Expensive multi-objective optimization is a prevalent and crucial concern in
many real-world scenarios, where sample-efficiency is vital due to the limited
evaluations to recover the true Pareto front for decision making. Existing
works either involve rebuilding Gaussian process surrogates from scratch for
each objective in each new problem encountered, or rely on extensive past
domain experiments for pre-training deep learning models, making them hard to
generalize and impractical to cope with various emerging applications in the
real world. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm named FoMEMO
(Foundation Models for Expensive Multi-objective Optimization), which enables
the establishment of a foundation model conditioned on any domain trajectory
and user preference, and facilitates fast in-context optimization based on the
predicted preference-wise aggregation posteriors. Rather than accessing
extensive domain experiments in the real world, we demonstrate that
pre-training the foundation model with a diverse set of hundreds of millions of
synthetic data can lead to superior adaptability to unknown problems, without
necessitating any subsequent model training or updates in the optimization
process. We evaluate our method across a variety of synthetic benchmarks and
real-word applications, and demonstrate its superior generality and competitive
performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Representation choice is of fundamental importance to our ability to
communicate and reason effectively. A major unsolved problem, addressed in this
paper, is how to devise \textit{representational-system (RS) agnostic}
techniques that drive representation transformation and choice. We present a
novel calculus, called \textit{structure transfer}, that enables representation
transformation across diverse RSs. Specifically, given a \textit{source}
representation drawn from a source RS, the rules of structure transfer allow us
to generate a \textit{target} representation for a target RS. The generality of
structure transfer comes in part from its ability to ensure that the source
representation and the generated target representation satisfy \textit{any}
specified relation (such as semantic equivalence). This is done by exploiting
\textit{schemas}, which encode knowledge about RSs. Specifically, schemas can
express \textit{preservation of information} across relations between any pair
of RSs, and this knowledge is used by structure transfer to derive a structure
for the target representation which ensures that the desired relation holds. We
formalise this using Representational Systems Theory~\cite{raggi2022rst},
building on the key concept of a \textit{construction space}. The abstract
nature of construction spaces grants them the generality to model RSs of
diverse kinds, including formal languages, geometric figures and diagrams, as
well as informal notations. Consequently, structure transfer is a
system-agnostic calculus that can be used to identify alternative
representations in a wide range of practical settings.

TL;DR: HyPV-LEAD是一个用于加密货币异常交易检测的早期预警框架，通过窗口-视野建模、峰谷采样和双曲嵌入技术，在比特币交易数据上实现了0.9624的PR-AUC性能。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加密货币异常交易（如混币服务、欺诈转账和拉高出货）对金融完整性构成日益增长的风险，但现有方法主要是模型中心化和事后检测，无法提供预防性价值。

Method: HyPV-LEAD框架包含三个创新：(1)窗口-视野建模确保可操作的提前预警；(2)峰谷采样缓解类别不平衡同时保持时间连续性；(3)双曲嵌入捕捉区块链交易网络的层次和无标度特性。

Conclusion: 通过将异常检测从被动分类转变为主动预警，HyPV-LEAD为实时风险管理、反洗钱合规和动态区块链环境中的金融安全建立了坚实基础。

Abstract: Abnormal cryptocurrency transactions - such as mixing services, fraudulent
transfers, and pump-and-dump operations -- pose escalating risks to financial
integrity but remain notoriously difficult to detect due to class imbalance,
temporal volatility, and complex network dependencies. Existing approaches are
predominantly model-centric and post hoc, flagging anomalies only after they
occur and thus offering limited preventive value. This paper introduces
HyPV-LEAD (Hyperbolic Peak-Valley Lead-time Enabled Anomaly Detection), a
data-driven early-warning framework that explicitly incorporates lead time into
anomaly detection. Unlike prior methods, HyPV-LEAD integrates three
innovations: (1) window-horizon modeling to guarantee actionable lead-time
alerts, (2) Peak-Valley (PV) sampling to mitigate class imbalance while
preserving temporal continuity, and (3) hyperbolic embedding to capture the
hierarchical and scale-free properties of blockchain transaction networks.
Empirical evaluation on large-scale Bitcoin transaction data demonstrates that
HyPV-LEAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a
PR-AUC of 0.9624 with significant gains in precision and recall. Ablation
studies further confirm that each component - PV sampling, hyperbolic
embedding, and structural-temporal modeling - provides complementary benefits,
with the full framework delivering the highest performance. By shifting anomaly
detection from reactive classification to proactive early-warning, HyPV-LEAD
establishes a robust foundation for real-time risk management, anti-money
laundering (AML) compliance, and financial security in dynamic blockchain

Abstract: Training large-scale deep learning models has become a key challenge for the
scientific community and industry. While the massive use of GPUs can
significantly speed up training times, this approach has a negative impact on
efficiency. In this article, we present a detailed analysis of the times
reported by MLPerf Training v4.1 on four workloads: BERT, Llama2 LoRA,
RetinaNet, and Stable Diffusion, showing that there are configurations that
optimise the relationship between performance, GPU usage, and efficiency. The
results point to a break-even point that allows training times to be reduced
while maximising efficiency.

Motivation: 缺失数据是机器学习中的核心挑战，特别是在生物信息学和临床机器学习领域。尽管存在多种插补方法，但没有一种方法能够在所有数据集和缺失机制下都表现良好。

Method: 提出Meta-Imputation Balanced (MIB)方法，通过在知道真实值的合成遮盖数据上训练，学习根据每种方法的行为预测最适合的插补值，综合多个基础插补器的输出。

Conclusion: 这项工作为实际机器学习系统中更稳健、模块化和可解释性的预处理流程开启了新路径，提高了插补的净确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Missing data represents a fundamental challenge in machine learning
applications, often reducing model performance and reliability. This problem is
particularly acute in fields like bioinformatics and clinical machine learning,
where datasets are frequently incomplete due to the nature of both data
generation and data collection. While numerous imputation methods exist, from
simple statistical techniques to advanced deep learning models, no single
method consistently performs well across diverse datasets and missingness
mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel Meta-Imputation approach that learns to
combine the outputs of multiple base imputers to predict missing values more
accurately. By training the proposed method called Meta-Imputation Balanced
(MIB) on synthetically masked data with known ground truth, the system learns
to predict the most suitable imputed value based on the behavior of each
method. Our work highlights the potential of ensemble learning in imputation
and paves the way for more robust, modular, and interpretable preprocessing
pipelines in real-world machine learning systems.

TL;DR: EvolveSignal使用大型语言模型自动发现新的交通信号控制算法，通过程序合成和进化搜索优化，在信号交叉口实验中比Webster基准减少20.1%的平均延误和47.1%的平均停车次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定时间交通信号控制虽然成本低、稳定且可解释，但依赖手工公式和人工调整，在异构或拥堵条件下效果不佳且劳动密集。

Method: 将问题表述为程序合成，候选算法表示为具有固定输入输出结构的Python函数，通过外部评估（如交通模拟器）和进化搜索进行迭代优化。

Result: 实验表明发现的算法优于Webster基准，平均延误减少20.1%，平均停车次数减少47.1%。消融和增量分析显示调整周期长度边界、纳入右转需求和重新分配绿灯时间等修改具有实际意义。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过利用AI进行交通信号控制算法设计，开辟了新的研究方向，将程序合成与交通工程相结合。

Abstract: In traffic engineering, the fixed-time traffic signal control remains widely
used for its low cost, stability, and interpretability. However, its design
depends on hand-crafted formulas (e.g., Webster) and manual re-timing by
engineers to adapt to demand changes, which is labor-intensive and often yields
suboptimal results under heterogeneous or congested conditions. This paper
introduces the EvolveSignal, a large language models (LLMs) powered coding
agent to automatically discover new traffic signal control algorithms. We
formulate the problem as program synthesis, where candidate algorithms are
represented as Python functions with fixed input-output structures, and
iteratively optimized through external evaluations (e.g., a traffic simulator)
and evolutionary search. Experiments on a signalized intersection demonstrate
that the discovered algorithms outperform Webster's baseline, reducing average
delay by 20.1% and average stops by 47.1%. Beyond performance, ablation and
incremental analyses reveal that EvolveSignal modifications-such as adjusting
cycle length bounds, incorporating right-turn demand, and rescaling green
allocations-can offer practically meaningful insights for traffic engineers.
This work opens a new research direction by leveraging AI for algorithm design
in traffic signal control, bridging program synthesis with transportation
engineering.

TL;DR: 基于流匹配的生成式框架，用于建模非线性动力系统分叉现象中的多重稳定解分布，允许直接采样多个合法解而保持系统对称性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确定性机器学习模型在建模非线性动力系统分叉现象时常常平均化多重解，无法描述低对称性结果，需要能够捐换多模态分布的概率化方法

Method: 提出基于流匹配的生成式框架，通过等变模型保持系统对称性，并介绍了对称匹配策略来对齐群作用下的预测和目标输出

Result: 在从玩具模型到复杂物理问题（如屈曲梁和Allen-Cahn方程）的一系列系统上验证了方法，流匹配在捐换多模态分布和对称性破碎分叉方面显著超过非概率和变分方法

Conclusion: 流匹配为建模高维系统中的多稳定性提供了一种有理论基础的可扩展解决方案，能够有效捐换分叉现象中的多重稳定解分布

Abstract: Bifurcation phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems often lead to multiple
coexisting stable solutions, particularly in the presence of symmetry breaking.
Deterministic machine learning models struggle to capture this multiplicity,
averaging over solutions and failing to represent lower-symmetry outcomes. In
this work, we propose a generative framework based on flow matching to model
the full probability distribution over bifurcation outcomes. Our method enables
direct sampling of multiple valid solutions while preserving system symmetries
through equivariant modeling. We introduce a symmetric matching strategy that
aligns predicted and target outputs under group actions, allowing accurate
learning in equivariant settings. We validate our approach on a range of
systems, from toy models to complex physical problems such as buckling beams
and the Allen-Cahn equation. Our results demonstrate that flow matching
significantly outperforms non-probabilistic and variational methods in
capturing multimodal distributions and symmetry-breaking bifurcations, offering
a principled and scalable solution for modeling multistability in
high-dimensional systems.

TL;DR: GANs在差分隐私训练下比扩散模型对成员推理攻击具有更强的隐私鲁棒性，理论分析和实验验证均显示GANs的结构性优势


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然GANs和扩散模型都可以在差分隐私下训练来保护敏感数据，但它们对成员推理攻击的敏感性仍未被充分理解，这是数据机密性的关键威胁

Method: 通过基于稳定性的理论分析比较两种模型对数据扰动的敏感性，并使用标准化的MIA流程进行全面的实证研究，评估不同数据集和隐私预算下的隐私泄露

Result: 结果显示GANs比扩散模型表现出显著的隐私鲁棒性优势，即使在强差分隐私机制下，模型类型本身也能关键性地影响隐私泄露程度

Conclusion: GANs在抵抗成员推理攻击方面具有结构性优势，模型选择对隐私保护至关重要

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models have emerged as
leading approaches for high-quality image synthesis. While both can be trained
under differential privacy (DP) to protect sensitive data, their sensitivity to
membership inference attacks (MIAs), a key threat to data confidentiality,
remains poorly understood. In this work, we present the first unified
theoretical and empirical analysis of the privacy risks faced by differentially
private generative models. We begin by showing, through a stability-based
analysis, that GANs exhibit fundamentally lower sensitivity to data
perturbations than diffusion models, suggesting a structural advantage in
resisting MIAs. We then validate this insight with a comprehensive empirical
study using a standardized MIA pipeline to evaluate privacy leakage across
datasets and privacy budgets. Our results consistently reveal a marked privacy
robustness gap in favor of GANs, even in strong DP regimes, highlighting that
model type alone can critically shape privacy leakage.

Conclusion: 生成模型与预测模型相结合的方法有助于表位发现，可加速合成表位的生成和筛选，在新型生物技术开发中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Epitopes are short antigenic peptide sequences which are recognized by
antibodies or immune cell receptors. These are central to the development of
immunotherapies, vaccines, and diagnostics. However, the rational design of
synthetic epitope libraries is challenging due to the large combinatorial
sequence space, $20^n$ combinations for linear epitopes of n amino acids,
making screening and testing unfeasible, even with high throughput experimental
techniques. In this study, we present a large language model, epiGPTope,
pre-trained on protein data and specifically fine-tuned on linear epitopes,
which for the first time can directly generate novel epitope-like sequences,
which are found to possess statistical properties analogous to the ones of
known epitopes. This generative approach can be used to prepare libraries of
epitope candidate sequences. We further train statistical classifiers to
predict whether an epitope sequence is of bacterial or viral origin, thus
narrowing the candidate library and increasing the likelihood of identifying
specific epitopes. We propose that such combination of generative and
predictive models can be of assistance in epitope discovery. The approach uses
only primary amino acid sequences of linear epitopes, bypassing the need for a
geometric framework or hand-crafted features of the sequences. By developing a
method to create biologically feasible sequences, we anticipate faster and more
cost-effective generation and screening of synthetic epitopes, with relevant
applications in the development of new biotechnologies.

Abstract: Resource allocation is crucial for the performance optimization of
cloud-assisted multi-agent intelligence. Traditional methods often overlook
agents' diverse computational capabilities and complex operating environments,
leading to inefficient and unfair resource distribution. To address this, we
open-sourced Fair-Synergy, an algorithmic framework that utilizes the concave
relationship between the agents' accuracy and the system resources to ensure
fair resource allocation across fleet intelligence. We extend traditional
allocation approaches to encompass a multidimensional machine learning utility
landscape defined by model parameters, training data volume, and task
complexity. We evaluate Fair-Synergy with advanced vision and language models
such as BERT, VGG16, MobileNet, and ResNets on datasets including MNIST,
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, BDD, and GLUE. We demonstrate that Fair-Synergy
outperforms standard benchmarks by up to 25% in multi-agent inference and 11%
in multi-agent learning settings. Also, we explore how the level of fairness
affects the least advantaged, most advantaged, and average agents, providing
insights for equitable fleet intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索夏令时实施对不同地理位置国家睡眠时长的影响

Method: 采用61个国家数据，进行统计相关分析，按DST实施情况分组，通过可视化比较睡眠模式

Result: DST国家平均睡眠时长更长，但维度作用明显：低维度地区DST国家睡眠更短，高维度地区DST国家睡眠更长

Conclusion: 夏令时对睡眠的影响受到地理位置的调节作用

Abstract: In this study we analyzed average sleep durations across 61 countries to
examine the impact of Daylight Saving Time (DST) practices. Key metrics
influencing sleep were identified, and statistical correlation analysis was
applied to explore relationships among these factors. Countries were grouped
based on DST observance, and visualizations compared sleep patterns between DST
and non-DST regions. Results show that, on average, countries observing DST
tend to report longer sleep durations than those that do not. A more detailed
pattern emerged when accounting for latitude: at lower latitudes, DST-observing
countries reported shorter sleep durations compared to non-DST countries, while
at higher latitudes, DST-observing countries reported longer average sleep
durations. These findings suggest that the influence of DST on sleep may be
moderated by geographical location.

<details>

Result: 成功将二元假设下的校准理论扩展到多元假设，提出了多类似然函数校准的完整理论框架，并在非线性判别分析中实现了校准的似然函数。

Conclusion: 这项工作为多类假设下的似然函数校准提供了理论基础，提高了机器学习方法的可解释性和可靠性，特别是在需要校准证据权重的应用中。

Abstract: While calibration of probabilistic predictions has been widely studied, this
paper rather addresses calibration of likelihood functions. This has been
discussed, especially in biometrics, in cases with only two exhaustive and
mutually exclusive hypotheses (classes) where likelihood functions can be
written as log-likelihood-ratios (LLRs). After defining calibration for LLRs
and its connection with the concept of weight-of-evidence, we present the
idempotence property and its associated constraint on the distribution of the
LLRs. Although these results have been known for decades, they have been
limited to the binary case. Here, we extend them to cases with more than two
hypotheses by using the Aitchison geometry of the simplex, which allows us to
recover, in a vector form, the additive form of the Bayes' rule; extending
therefore the LLR and the weight-of-evidence to any number of hypotheses.
Especially, we extend the definition of calibration, the idempotence, and the
constraint on the distribution of likelihood functions to this multiple
hypotheses and multiclass counterpart of the LLR: the isometric-log-ratio
transformed likelihood function. This work is mainly conceptual, but we still
provide one application to machine learning by presenting a non-linear
discriminant analysis where the discriminant components form a calibrated
likelihood function over the classes, improving therefore the interpretability
and the reliability of the method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: t-SNE和UMAP等降维方法在可视化聚类数据时虽然能很好分离簇群，但往往会扭曲数据的全局几何结构

Method: 采用三步法：先对数据进行聚类，然后分别嵌入每个簇，最后对齐所有簇以获得全局嵌入

Result: 在多个合成和真实数据集上验证，该方法与现有方法竞争力相当，但更加透明

Conclusion: 模块化的聚类-嵌入-对齐方法提供了一种更透明且能更好保持全局结构的降维替代方案

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction methods such as t-SNE and UMAP are popular methods
for visualizing data with a potential (latent) clustered structure. They are
known to group data points at the same time as they embed them, resulting in
visualizations with well-separated clusters that preserve local information
well. However, t-SNE and UMAP also tend to distort the global geometry of the
underlying data. We propose a more transparent, modular approach consisting of
first clustering the data, then embedding each cluster, and finally aligning
the clusters to obtain a global embedding. We demonstrate this approach on
several synthetic and real-world datasets and show that it is competitive with
existing methods, while being much more transparent.

Motivation: 虽然自动化强化学习方法在肺热症治疗中发挥了作用，但以往研究依赖关系数据。考虑到现代医疗数据的复杂性，使用图结构表示数据可能提供更自然和有效的方法。

Method: 研究将MIMIC-III数据集中的患者数据建模为时间演化的异构图，使用GraphSAGE和GATv2两种图神经网络架构学习患者状态表征，并采用表征学习与策略学习解耦的方法。

Result: 实验评估结果证实了基于图的方法的潜力，同时也展现了在这个领域进行表征学习的复杂性。

Conclusion: 图基于方法在肺热症治疗决策支持中具有潜力，但表征学习在这一领域仍面临着重要的技术挑战。

Abstract: Sepsis is a serious, life-threatening condition. When treating sepsis, it is
challenging to determine the correct amount of intravenous fluids and
vasopressors for a given patient. While automated reinforcement learning
(RL)-based methods have been used to support these decisions with promising
results, previous studies have relied on relational data. Given the complexity
of modern healthcare data, representing data as a graph may provide a more
natural and effective approach. This study models patient data from the
well-known MIMIC-III dataset as a heterogeneous graph that evolves over time.
Subsequently, we explore two Graph Neural Network architectures - GraphSAGE and
GATv2 - for learning patient state representations, adopting the approach of
decoupling representation learning from policy learning. The encoders are
trained to produce latent state representations, jointly with decoders that
predict the next patient state. These representations are then used for policy
learning with the dBCQ algorithm. The results of our experimental evaluation
confirm the potential of a graph-based approach, while highlighting the
complexity of representation learning in this domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的结果奖励模型(ORM)过于粗粒度，无法区分正确答案中的错误推理或错误答案中的有效推理；而过程奖励模型(PRM)虽然提供细粒度指导，但存在不准确性和奖励攻击问题

Method: 提出PROF方法，通过一致性驱动的样本选择来协调PRM和ORM的互补优势，保留过程值较高的正确响应和过程值较低的错误响应，同时保持正负训练样本平衡

Result: 实验表明该方法相比混合方法持续提升最终准确率超过4%，同时增强了中间推理步骤的质量

Conclusion: PROF通过有效的数据过程筛选方法，成功解决了细粒度过程奖励和粗粒度结果奖励之间的协调问题，为数学推理任务的强化学习提供了更优的训练策略

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged to be a
predominant paradigm for mathematical reasoning tasks, offering stable
improvements in reasoning ability. However, Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) in
RLVR are too coarse-grained to distinguish flawed reasoning within correct
answers or valid reasoning within incorrect answers. This lack of granularity
introduces noisy and misleading gradients significantly and hinders further
progress in reasoning process quality. While Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer
fine-grained guidance for intermediate steps, they frequently suffer from
inaccuracies and are susceptible to reward hacking.
  To resolve this dilemma, we introduce PRocess cOnsistency Filter (PROF), an
effective data process curation method that harmonizes noisy, fine-grained
process rewards with accurate, coarse-grained outcome rewards. Rather than
naively blending PRM and ORM in the objective function
(arXiv:archive/2506.18896), PROF leverages their complementary strengths
through consistency-driven sample selection. Our approach retains correct
responses with higher averaged process values and incorrect responses with
lower averaged process values, while maintaining positive/negative training
sample balance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only
consistently improves the final accuracy over $4\%$ compared to the blending
approaches, but also strengthens the quality of intermediate reasoning steps.

Motivation: KANs作为一种新兴的神经网络架构，虽然在各种科学和机器学习任务中表现出色，但其初始化策略尚未得到充分研究，这限制了其性能的进一步提升。

Method: 提出了两种理论驱动的初始化方法（基于LeCun和Glorot理论）和一个经验性的幂律初始化家族，通过大规模网格搜索、函数拟合、前向PDE基准测试以及神经正切核分析来评估这些方法。

Conclusion: 本文为KANs提供了有效的初始化策略，特别是幂律初始化方法表现出色，为KANs的进一步发展和应用提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are a recently introduced neural
architecture that replace fixed nonlinearities with trainable activation
functions, offering enhanced flexibility and interpretability. While KANs have
been applied successfully across scientific and machine learning tasks, their
initialization strategies remain largely unexplored. In this work, we study
initialization schemes for spline-based KANs, proposing two theory-driven
approaches inspired by LeCun and Glorot, as well as an empirical power-law
family with tunable exponents. Our evaluation combines large-scale grid
searches on function fitting and forward PDE benchmarks, an analysis of
training dynamics through the lens of the Neural Tangent Kernel, and
evaluations on a subset of the Feynman dataset. Our findings indicate that the
Glorot-inspired initialization significantly outperforms the baseline in
parameter-rich models, while power-law initialization achieves the strongest
performance overall, both across tasks and for architectures of varying size.

TL;DR: LINKER是首个基于序列的模型，仅使用蛋白质序列和配体SMILES就能预测残基-功能基团相互作用类型，无需3D结构输入


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法依赖3D结构输入或基于距离的接触标签，限制了应用范围和生物学相关性，需要开发仅基于序列的相互作用预测方法

Method: 使用结构监督的注意力机制训练，通过功能基团基序提取从3D蛋白-配体复合物获得交互标签，将配体结构抽象为功能基团

Result: 在LP-PDBBind基准测试中，基于功能基团抽象的结构监督能产生与真实生化注释高度一致的作用预测

Conclusion: LINKER仅需序列级输入即可实现大规模应用，在缺乏结构数据的场景中具有重要价值

Abstract: Accurate identification of interactions between protein residues and ligand
functional groups is essential to understand molecular recognition and guide
rational drug design. Existing deep learning approaches for protein-ligand
interpretability often rely on 3D structural input or use distance-based
contact labels, limiting both their applicability and biological relevance. We
introduce LINKER, the first sequence-based model to predict residue-functional
group interactions in terms of biologically defined interaction types, using
only protein sequences and the ligand SMILES as input. LINKER is trained with
structure-supervised attention, where interaction labels are derived from 3D
protein-ligand complexes via functional group-based motif extraction. By
abstracting ligand structures into functional groups, the model focuses on
chemically meaningful substructures while predicting interaction types rather
than mere spatial proximity. Crucially, LINKER requires only sequence-level
input at inference time, enabling large-scale application in settings where
structural data is unavailable. Experiments on the LP-PDBBind benchmark
demonstrate that structure-informed supervision over functional group
abstractions yields interaction predictions closely aligned with ground-truth
biochemical annotations.

Abstract: Simulating particle dynamics with high fidelity is crucial for solving
real-world interaction and control tasks involving liquids in design, graphics,
and robotics. Recently, data-driven approaches, particularly those based on
graph neural networks (GNNs), have shown progress in tackling such problems.
However, these approaches are often limited to learning fluid behavior in
static free-fall environments or simple manipulation settings involving
primitive objects, often overlooking complex interactions with dynamically
moving kinematic rigid bodies. Here, we propose a GNN-based framework designed
from the ground up to learn the dynamics of liquids under rigid body
interactions and active manipulations, where particles are represented as graph
nodes and particle-object collisions are handled using surface representations
with the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) algorithm. This approach enables the
network to model complex interactions between liquid particles and intricate
surface geometries. Our model accurately captures fluid behavior in dynamic
settings and can also function as a simulator in static free-fall environments.
Despite being trained on a single-object manipulation task of pouring, our
model generalizes effectively to environments with unseen objects and novel
manipulation tasks such as stirring and scooping. Finally, we show that the
learned dynamics can be leveraged to solve control and manipulation tasks using
gradient-based optimization methods.

*Yubo Gao,Renbo Tu,Gennady Pekhimenko,Nandita Vijaykumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DP-SGD中的量化会导致比普通SGD更严重的精度下降，QPQuant通过动态量化层选择和损失敏感度估计来解决这个问题，在保持隐私保护的同时显著提升训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化技术能大幅减少DP-SGD训练的时间和能耗，但研究发现量化会显著加剧DP-SGD中的精度下降，这是因为噪声注入放大了量化方差。

Method: 提出QPQuant动态量化框架：1）每轮epoch概率性采样选择要量化的层子集；2）使用差分隐私损失敏感度估计器识别对模型质量影响最小的层进行量化。

Result: 在ResNet18、ResNet50和DenseNet121上的实验表明，QPQuant优于静态量化基线，达到接近帕累托最优的精度-计算权衡，理论吞吐量提升达2.21倍，验证精度下降小于2%。

Conclusion: QPQuant有效解决了DP-SGD中量化导致的精度下降问题，在保持差分隐私保证的同时显著提升了低精度硬件上的训练效率。

Abstract: Differentially-Private SGD (DP-SGD) is a powerful technique to protect user
privacy when using sensitive data to train neural networks. During training,
converting model weights and activations into low-precision formats, i.e.,
quantization, can drastically reduce training times, energy consumption, and
cost, and is thus a widely used technique. In this work, we demonstrate that
quantization causes significantly higher accuracy degradation in DP-SGD
compared to regular SGD. We observe that this is caused by noise injection in
DP-SGD, which amplifies quantization variance, leading to disproportionately
large accuracy degradation. To address this challenge, we present QPQuant, a
dynamic quantization framework that adaptively selects a changing subset of
layers to quantize at each epoch. Our method combines two key ideas that
effectively reduce quantization variance: (i) probabilistic sampling of the
layers that rotates which layers are quantized every epoch, and (ii) loss-aware
layer prioritization, which uses a differentially private loss sensitivity
estimator to identify layers that can be quantized with minimal impact on model
quality. This estimator consumes a negligible fraction of the overall privacy
budget, preserving DP guarantees. Empirical evaluations on ResNet18, ResNet50,
and DenseNet121 across a range of datasets demonstrate that DPQuant
consistently outperforms static quantization baselines, achieving near
Pareto-optimal accuracy-compute trade-offs and up to 2.21x theoretical
throughput improvements on low-precision hardware, with less than 2% drop in
validation accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明了Tuning without Forgetting (TwF)方法中的参数子空间在非奇异控制下形成有限余维的Banach子流形，并刻画了其切空间，为TwF在顺序训练中精确保持映射（不遗忘）提供了理论依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为之前提出的TwF方法提供严格的理论基础，证明其在顺序训练中能够精确保持已学习样本的端点映射，而不仅仅是一阶近似意义下的保持。

Method: 通过数学分析证明在非奇异控制条件下，TwF的参数子空间构成有限余维的Banach子流形，并详细刻画该子流形的切空间结构。

Result: 证明了TwF对应的参数子空间确实是一个Banach子流形，其切空间描述了控制函数沿该子流形的连续变形方式，从而确保映射的精确保持。

Conclusion: 该研究为TwF方法提供了坚实的数学理论基础，表明该方法能够在顺序训练过程中精确地保持已学习样本的映射关系，超越了之前的一阶近似理解。

Abstract: In our earlier work, we introduced the principle of Tuning without Forgetting
(TwF) for sequential training of neural ODEs, where training samples are added
iteratively and parameters are updated within the subspace of control functions
that preserves the end-point mapping at previously learned samples on the
manifold of output labels in the first-order approximation sense. In this
letter, we prove that this parameter subspace forms a Banach submanifold of
finite codimension under nonsingular controls, and we characterize its tangent
space. This reveals that TwF corresponds to a continuation/deformation of the
control function along the tangent space of this Banach submanifold, providing
a theoretical foundation for its mapping-preserving (not forgetting) during the
sequential training exactly, beyond first-order approximation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Robult是一个可扩展的多模态学习框架，通过信息论方法解决模态缺失和标注数据有限的问题，采用PU对比损失和潜在重构损失来保持模态特异性信息并利用冗余性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态学习中模态缺失和有限标注数据的关键挑战，提升模型的鲁棒性和实用性。

Method: 提出软正样本-无标注(PU)对比损失最大化任务相关特征对齐，以及潜在重构损失确保模态特异性信息保留，采用模块化设计。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验验证表明，Robult在半监督学习和模态缺失场景下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Robult框架具有轻量级设计和良好可扩展性，能够无缝集成到现有架构中，适用于实际多模态应用场景。

Abstract: Addressing missing modalities and limited labeled data is crucial for
advancing robust multimodal learning. We propose Robult, a scalable framework
designed to mitigate these challenges by preserving modality-specific
information and leveraging redundancy through a novel information-theoretic
approach. Robult optimizes two core objectives: (1) a soft Positive-Unlabeled
(PU) contrastive loss that maximizes task-relevant feature alignment while
effectively utilizing limited labeled data in semi-supervised settings, and (2)
a latent reconstruction loss that ensures unique modality-specific information
is retained. These strategies, embedded within a modular design, enhance
performance across various downstream tasks and ensure resilience to incomplete
modalities during inference. Experimental results across diverse datasets
validate that Robult achieves superior performance over existing approaches in
both semi-supervised learning and missing modality contexts. Furthermore, its
lightweight design promotes scalability and seamless integration with existing
architectures, making it suitable for real-world multimodal applications.

Conclusion: SafeProtein框架成功暴露了蛋白质基础模型的安全漏洞，为前沿模型开发稳健的安全防护技术提供了重要见解

Abstract: Proteins play crucial roles in almost all biological processes. The
advancement of deep learning has greatly accelerated the development of protein
foundation models, leading to significant successes in protein understanding
and design. However, the lack of systematic red-teaming for these models has
raised serious concerns about their potential misuse, such as generating
proteins with biological safety risks. This paper introduces SafeProtein, the
first red-teaming framework designed for protein foundation models to the best
of our knowledge. SafeProtein combines multimodal prompt engineering and
heuristic beam search to systematically design red-teaming methods and conduct
tests on protein foundation models. We also curated SafeProtein-Bench, which
includes a manually constructed red-teaming benchmark dataset and a
comprehensive evaluation protocol. SafeProtein achieved continuous jailbreaks
on state-of-the-art protein foundation models (up to 70% attack success rate
for ESM3), revealing potential biological safety risks in current protein
foundation models and providing insights for the development of robust security
protection technologies for frontier models. The codes will be made publicly

*Han Shen*

TL;DR: AEnt是一种针对LLM-RL训练的新型熵控制方法，通过钳位熵奖励和自动调整系数解决传统熵正则化在大语言模型强化学习中的失效问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统熵正则化在机器人控制和游戏RL中有效，但在LLM-RL训练中效果不佳，主要原因是LLM响应空间极大且最优输出稀疏

Method: 提出AEnt方法：使用钳位熵奖励（在更小的token空间上重新归一化策略计算），并自动调整熵系数来控制熵引起的偏差

Result: 在数学推理任务中，AEnt在不同基础模型和数据集上均优于基线方法，在多个基准测试中表现一致更好

Conclusion: AEnt通过创新的熵控制机制有效解决了LLM-RL训练中的探索问题，为语言模型强化学习提供了更有效的熵管理方案

Abstract: For RL algorithms, appropriate entropy control is crucial to their
effectiveness. To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy
regularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including
PPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic
and games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in
LLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL
setting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy
regularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the
sparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy
control method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically
adjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized
policy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration
within a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically
adjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively
controlling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits.
AEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and
datasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently
across multiple benchmarks.

TL;DR: 该研究构建了全球作物数据集CropGlobe，识别了对地理变化具有不变性的遥感特征，并提出CropNet模型和时序数据增强策略来提升跨区域作物分类的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球尺度的作物类型精确识别对粮食安全至关重要，但现有方法在地理迁移时性能下降严重，需要寻找对地理变化不变的特征表示来提升跨区域泛化能力。

Method: 构建包含30万个样本的全球作物数据集CropGlobe；比较Sentinel-2时序多光谱特征和EMIT高光谱特征的迁移性；设计轻量级CNN模型CropNet，结合时间偏移、时间尺度和幅度扭曲等时序数据增强技术。

Result: Sentinel-2的2D中值时序特征在所有迁移场景中表现出最强的稳定性；数据增强进一步提升了模型鲁棒性，特别是在训练数据多样性有限时效果显著。

Conclusion: 研究识别了更具不变性的特征表示，增强了地理迁移能力，为在全球多样化区域实现可扩展、低成本的作物类型应用提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Accurately obtaining crop type and its spatial distribution at a global scale
is critical for food security, agricultural policy-making, and sustainable
development. Remote sensing offers an efficient solution for large-scale crop
classification, but the limited availability of reliable ground samples in many
regions constrains applicability across geographic areas. To address
performance declines under geospatial shifts, this study identifies remote
sensing features that are invariant to geographic variation and proposes
strategies to enhance cross-regional generalization. We construct CropGlobe, a
global crop type dataset with 300,000 pixel-level samples from eight countries
across five continents, covering six major food and industrial crops (corn,
soybeans, rice, wheat, sugarcane, cotton). With broad geographic coverage,
CropGlobe enables a systematic evaluation under cross-country, cross-continent,
and cross-hemisphere transfer. We compare the transferability of temporal
multi-spectral features (Sentinel-2-based 1D/2D median features and harmonic
coefficients) and hyperspectral features (from EMIT). To improve generalization
under spectral and phenological shifts, we design CropNet, a lightweight and
robust CNN tailored for pixel-level crop classification, coupled with temporal
data augmentation (time shift, time scale, and magnitude warping) that
simulates realistic cross-regional phenology. Experiments show that 2D median
temporal features from Sentinel-2 consistently exhibit the strongest invariance
across all transfer scenarios, and augmentation further improves robustness,
particularly when training data diversity is limited. Overall, the work
identifies more invariant feature representations that enhance geographic
transferability and suggests a promising path toward scalable, low-cost crop
type applications across globally diverse regions.

TL;DR: ZOWarmUp是一种联邦零阶优化器，允许从随机初始化进行内存高效的训练，使资源受限的边缘设备能够参与联邦学习，提高数据多样性和训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中内存和通信受限的边缘设备被排除在训练之外的问题，减少系统偏差并提高数据可访问性。

Method: 基于MeZO零阶方法，设计联邦零阶优化器ZOWarmUp，利用不同客户端能力和方差减少技术，仅需传输少量随机种子而非完整梯度。

Result: 实验表明ZOWarmUp在各种数据集和模型架构下都具有鲁棒性，能够有效利用低资源客户端的数据改善训练结果。

Conclusion: ZOWarmUp为高比例资源受限设备的系统提供了访问更多样化数据的途径，显著提升了联邦学习的训练效果和包容性。

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across numerous edge
devices without requiring participants to share data; however, memory and
communication constraints on these edge devices may preclude their
participation in training. We consider a setting in which a subset of edge
devices are below a critical memory or communication threshold required to
conduct model updates. Under typical federated optimization algorithms, these
devices are excluded from training which renders their data inaccessible and
increases system induced bias. We are inspired by MeZO, a zeroth-order method
used for memory-efficient fine-tuning. The increased variance inherent to
zeroth-order gradient approximations has relegated previous zeroth-order
optimizers exclusively to the domain of fine tuning; a limitation we seek to
correct. We devise a federated, memory-efficient zeroth-order optimizer,
ZOWarmUp that permits zeroth-order training from a random initialization.
ZOWarmUp leverages differing client capabilities and careful variance reduction
techniques to facilitate participation of under-represented, low-resource
clients in model training. Like other federated zeroth-order methods, ZOWarmUp
eliminates the need for edge devices to transmit their full gradients to the
server and instead relies on only a small set of random seeds, rendering the
up-link communication cost negligible. We present experiments using various
datasets and model architectures to show that ZOWarmUp is a robust algorithm
that can can be applied under a wide variety of circumstances. For systems with
a high proportion of edge devices that would otherwise be excluded from
training, this algorithm provides access to a greater volume and diversity of
data, thus improving training outcomes.

Conclusion: 该研究为AI伦理讨论做出贡献，揭示了在高风险环境中部署LLM的风险和潜在保障措施，提供了识别和控制模型说谎行为的技术方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
a variety of tasks, but their increasing autonomy in real-world applications
raises concerns about their trustworthiness. While hallucinations-unintentional
falsehoods-have been widely studied, the phenomenon of lying, where an LLM
knowingly generates falsehoods to achieve an ulterior objective, remains
underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the lying behavior
of LLMs, differentiating it from hallucinations and testing it in practical
scenarios. Through mechanistic interpretability techniques, we uncover the
neural mechanisms underlying deception, employing logit lens analysis, causal
interventions, and contrastive activation steering to identify and control
deceptive behavior. We study real-world lying scenarios and introduce
behavioral steering vectors that enable fine-grained manipulation of lying
tendencies. Further, we explore the trade-offs between lying and end-task
performance, establishing a Pareto frontier where dishonesty can enhance goal
optimization. Our findings contribute to the broader discourse on AI ethics,
shedding light on the risks and potential safeguards for deploying LLMs in
high-stakes environments. Code and more illustrations are available at

Motivation: 传统基于选择题的评估方法无法充分评估LLM在复杂临床场景中的情境推理、意识处理和不确定性处理等关键能力，需要更全面的行为层面评估

Method: 使用HealthBench基准测试（基于专家标注的开放式健康对话的评分标准驱动基准），对DR.INFO这一基于RAG的智能临床支持助手进行评估，包括1000个困难样本和100个对比样本测试

Result: DR.INFO在困难子集上获得0.51分，显著超越GPT-5、o3、Grok 3、GPT-4、Gemini 2.5等前沿模型；在与其他RAG助手对比中保持0.54分的性能领先

Conclusion: 基于行为层面的评分标准评估对于构建可靠可信的AI临床支持助手具有重要价值，DR.INFO在沟通、指令遵循和准确性方面表现突出，但在情境意识和回答完整性方面仍需改进

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on their ability to generate
high-quality, accurate, situationally aware answers to clinical questions
requires going beyond conventional benchmarks to assess how these systems
behave in complex, high-stake clincal scenarios. Traditional evaluations are
often limited to multiple-choice questions that fail to capture essential
competencies such as contextual reasoning, awareness and uncertainty handling
etc. To address these limitations, we evaluate our agentic, RAG-based clinical
support assistant, DR.INFO, using HealthBench, a rubric-driven benchmark
composed of open-ended, expert-annotated health conversations. On the Hard
subset of 1,000 challenging examples, DR.INFO achieves a HealthBench score of
0.51, substantially outperforming leading frontier LLMs (GPT-5, o3, Grok 3,
GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, etc.) across all behavioral axes (accuracy, completeness,
instruction following, etc.). In a separate 100-sample evaluation against
similar agentic RAG assistants (OpenEvidence, Pathway.md), it maintains a
performance lead with a health-bench score of 0.54. These results highlight
DR.INFOs strengths in communication, instruction following, and accuracy, while
also revealing areas for improvement in context awareness and completeness of a
response. Overall, the findings underscore the utility of behavior-level,
rubric-based evaluation for building a reliable and trustworthy AI-enabled
clinical support assistant.

Motivation: 评估现有生物安全措施（主要是基于序列比对和蛋白质相互作用预测的推理时过滤器）在检测潜在合成生物武器方面的有效性，因为生成生物学的发展既带来了药物发现机会也引入了新的生物安全风险。

Method: 测试三种领先的蛋白质相互作用预测工具（AlphaFold 3、AF3Complex和SpatialPPIv2）在已知病毒-宿主相互作用（如乙肝病毒和SARS-CoV-2）上的性能表现。

Result: 尽管这些模型在许多相同病毒上进行了训练，但仍无法检测到大量已知相互作用。令人震惊的是，没有一种工具能成功识别出任何经过实验验证的SARS-CoV-2突变体的结合情况。

Conclusion: 当前预测过滤器不足以可靠地标记已知生物威胁，更不可能检测新型威胁。需要转向响应导向的基础设施，包括快速实验验证、适应性生物制造和能够跟上AI发展速度的监管框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative biology have enabled the design of novel
proteins, creating significant opportunities for drug discovery while also
introducing new risks, including the potential development of synthetic
bioweapons. Existing biosafety measures primarily rely on inference-time
filters such as sequence alignment and protein-protein interaction (PPI)
prediction to detect dangerous outputs. In this study, we evaluate the
performance of three leading PPI prediction tools: AlphaFold 3, AF3Complex, and
SpatialPPIv2. These models were tested on well-characterized viral-host
interactions, such as those involving Hepatitis B and SARS-CoV-2. Despite being
trained on many of the same viruses, the models fail to detect a substantial
number of known interactions. Strikingly, none of the tools successfully
identify any of the four experimentally validated SARS-CoV-2 mutants with
confirmed binding. These findings suggest that current predictive filters are
inadequate for reliably flagging even known biological threats and are even
more unlikely to detect novel ones. We argue for a shift toward
response-oriented infrastructure, including rapid experimental validation,
adaptable biomanufacturing, and regulatory frameworks capable of operating at
the speed of AI-driven developments.

Abstract: This study explores the deployment of three machine learning (ML) approaches
for real-time prediction of glucose, lactate, and ammonium concentrations in
cell culture processes, using Raman spectroscopy as input features. The
research addresses challenges associated with limited data availability and
process variability, providing a comparative analysis of pretrained models,
just-in-time learning (JITL), and online learning algorithms. Two industrial
case studies are presented to evaluate the impact of varying bioprocess
conditions on model performance. The findings highlight the specific conditions
under which pretrained models demonstrate superior predictive accuracy and
identify scenarios where JITL or online learning approaches are more effective
for adaptive process monitoring. This study also highlights the critical
importance of updating the deployed models/agents with the latest offline
analytical measurements during bioreactor operations to maintain the model
performance against the changes in cell growth behaviours and operating
conditions throughout the bioreactor run. Additionally, the study confirms the
usefulness of a simple mixture-of-experts framework in achieving enhanced
accuracy and robustness for real-time predictions of metabolite concentrations
based on Raman spectral data. These insights contribute to the development of
robust strategies for the efficient deployment of ML models in dynamic and
changing biomanufacturing environments.

Abstract: Simulacra Naturae is a data-driven media installation that explores
collective care through the entanglement of biological computation, material
ecologies, and generative systems. The work translates pre-recorded neural
activity from brain organoids, lab-grown three-dimensional clusters of neurons,
into a multi-sensory environment composed of generative visuals, spatial audio,
living plants, and fabricated clay artifacts. These biosignals, streamed
through a real-time system, modulate emergent agent behaviors inspired by
natural systems such as termite colonies and slime molds. Rather than using
biosignals as direct control inputs, Simulacra Naturae treats organoid activity
as a co-creative force, allowing neural rhythms to guide the growth, form, and
atmosphere of a generative ecosystem. The installation features computationally
fabricated clay prints embedded with solenoids, adding physical sound
resonances to the generative surround composition. The spatial environment,
filled with live tropical plants and a floor-level projection layer featuring
real-time generative AI visuals, invites participants into a sensory field
shaped by nonhuman cognition. By grounding abstract data in living materials
and embodied experience, Simulacra Naturae reimagines visualization as a
practice of care, one that decentralizes human agency and opens new spaces for
ethics, empathy, and ecological attunement within hybrid computational systems.

Motivation: 当前推荐系统依赖敏感数据引发隐私担忧，FHE能保护数据安全但处理大型稀疏矩阵效率低且通信开销高。

Method: 结合压缩稀疏行表示(CSR)和FHE基于矩阵分解的新方法，在加密域高效处理矩阵稀疏性，最小化通信成本。

Result: 实验结果显示在加密数据上实现了高推荐准确性，同时达到了最低的通信开销。

Conclusion: 该方法有效保护用户隐私，通过CSR与FHE的结合高效处理稀疏矩阵并降低通信成本，为隐私保护推荐系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: In today's data-driven world, recommendation systems personalize user
experiences across industries but rely on sensitive data, raising privacy
concerns. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) can secure these systems, but a
significant challenge in applying FHE to recommendation systems is efficiently
handling the inherently large and sparse user-item rating matrices. FHE
operations are computationally intensive, and naively processing various sparse
matrices in recommendation systems would be prohibitively expensive.
Additionally, the communication overhead between parties remains a critical
concern in encrypted domains. We propose a novel approach combining Compressed
Sparse Row (CSR) representation with FHE-based matrix factorization that
efficiently handles matrix sparsity in the encrypted domain while minimizing
communication costs. Our experimental results demonstrate high recommendation
accuracy with encrypted data while achieving the lowest communication costs,
effectively preserving user privacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统异构差分隐私(HDP)框架假设用户数据和隐私级别不相关，但在实际应用中这种相关性普遍存在，导致标准HDP框架失效。

Method: 提出AHDP框架，通过假设检验视角形式化隐私保证，设计了无需数据隐私相关性先验知识的非平凡机制，应用于均值估计、频率估计和线性回归等核心统计任务。

Result: AHDP框架对数据隐私相关性具有鲁棒性，提出的机制实现简单，假设和建模要求最小化，适合实际应用。

Conclusion: AHDP框架有效解决了数据与隐私需求相关时的隐私保护问题，提出的机制具有实用价值，为未来隐私保护研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Previous works in the differential privacy literature that allow users to
choose their privacy levels typically operate under the heterogeneous
differential privacy (HDP) framework with the simplifying assumption that user
data and privacy levels are not correlated. Firstly, we demonstrate that the
standard HDP framework falls short when user data and privacy demands are
allowed to be correlated. Secondly, to address this shortcoming, we propose an
alternate framework, Add-remove Heterogeneous Differential Privacy (AHDP), that
jointly accounts for user data and privacy preference. We show that AHDP is
robust to possible correlations between data and privacy. Thirdly, we formalize
the guarantees of the proposed AHDP framework through an operational hypothesis
testing perspective. The hypothesis testing setup may be of independent
interest in analyzing other privacy frameworks as well. Fourthly, we show that
there exists non-trivial AHDP mechanisms that notably do not require prior
knowledge of the data-privacy correlations. We propose some such mechanisms and
apply them to core statistical tasks such as mean estimation, frequency
estimation, and linear regression. The proposed mechanisms are simple to
implement with minimal assumptions and modeling requirements, making them
attractive for real-world use. Finally, we empirically evaluate proposed AHDP
mechanisms, highlighting their trade-offs using LLM-generated synthetic
datasets, which we release for future research.

Abstract: The increasing availability of personal data has enabled significant advances
in fields such as machine learning, healthcare, and cybersecurity. However,
this data abundance also raises serious privacy concerns, especially in light
of powerful re-identification attacks and growing legal and ethical demands for
responsible data use. Differential privacy (DP) has emerged as a principled,
mathematically grounded framework for mitigating these risks. This review
provides a comprehensive survey of DP, covering its theoretical foundations,
practical mechanisms, and real-world applications. It explores key algorithmic
tools and domain-specific challenges - particularly in privacy-preserving
machine learning and synthetic data generation. The report also highlights
usability issues and the need for improved communication and transparency in DP
systems. Overall, the goal is to support informed adoption of DP by researchers
and practitioners navigating the evolving landscape of data privacy.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于梯度的敏感性度量方法来解决决策依赖博弈中的分布偏移问题，无需依赖不切实际的β平滑性假设，并开发了敏感性感知的重复训练算法来保证收敛到性能稳定均衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 决策依赖博弈中，多个玩家在随联合动作变化的数据分布下优化决策，传统方法依赖β平滑性假设（损失函数梯度关于数据分布的Lipschitz连续性），但数据分布映射关系通常未知，导致β无法获取，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出梯度敏感性度量直接量化决策引起的分布偏移影响；在强单调性的实用假设下推导收敛保证；开发敏感性感知的重复训练算法，根据敏感性度量调整玩家的损失函数。

Result: 在预测误差最小化博弈、古诺竞争和收益最大化博弈的实验中，该方法优于现有基线方法，实现了更低的损失和更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: 所提出的敏感性度量方法和算法能够有效处理任意数据分布映射，保证收敛到性能稳定均衡，解决了传统方法对β平滑性假设的依赖问题。

Abstract: In decision-dependent games, multiple players optimize their decisions under
a data distribution that shifts with their joint actions, creating complex
dynamics in applications like market pricing. A practical consequence of these
dynamics is the \textit{performatively stable equilibrium}, where each player's
strategy is a best response under the induced distribution. Prior work relies
on $\beta$-smoothness, assuming Lipschitz continuity of loss function gradients
with respect to the data distribution, which is impractical as the data
distribution maps, i.e., the relationship between joint decision and the
resulting distribution shifts, are typically unknown, rendering $\beta$
unobtainable. To overcome this limitation, we propose a gradient-based
sensitivity measure that directly quantifies the impact of decision-induced
distribution shifts. Leveraging this measure, we derive convergence guarantees
for performatively stable equilibria under a practically feasible assumption of
strong monotonicity. Accordingly, we develop a sensitivity-informed repeated
retraining algorithm that adjusts players' loss functions based on the
sensitivity measure, guaranteeing convergence to performatively stable
equilibria for arbitrary data distribution maps. Experiments on prediction
error minimization game, Cournot competition, and revenue maximization game
show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving lower
losses and faster convergence.

TL;DR: 基于渗透模型的自动招标方法CBD，通过序列完成和轨迹对齐提升生成质量，在竞争性招标环境中实现了显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 渗透模型在自动招标中展现了演进轨迹奖励和可解释性的潜力，但遇到生成不确定性问题，尤其是状态间动态合法性的挑战，导致竞争招标环境中的性能损失

Method: 提出CBD方法：1）在渗透训练中添加额外变量t，让模型观察t长度历史序列并完成剩余序列，提升动态合法性；2）使用轨迹级判别器精炼生成轨迹，更好对齐广告主目标

Result: 在大规模自动招标测试中表现优异，在具有挑战性的稀疏奖励招标环境中转换价值提升29.9%；在快手在线广告平台上实现了2.0%目标成本增长

Conclusion: CBD方法通过动态合法性提升和轨迹对齐，有效解决了渗透模型在自动招标中的不确定性问题，在理论测试和实际应用中都取得了显著成效

Abstract: Auto-bidding is central to computational advertising, achieving notable
commercial success by optimizing advertisers' bids within economic constraints.
Recently, large generative models show potential to revolutionize auto-bidding
by generating bids that could flexibly adapt to complex, competitive
environments. Among them, diffusers stand out for their ability to address
sparse-reward challenges by focusing on trajectory-level accumulated rewards,
as well as their explainable capability, i.e., planning a future trajectory of
states and executing bids accordingly. However, diffusers struggle with
generation uncertainty, particularly regarding dynamic legitimacy between
adjacent states, which can lead to poor bids and further cause significant loss
of ad impression opportunities when competing with other advertisers in a
highly competitive auction environment. To address it, we propose a Causal
auto-Bidding method based on a Diffusion completer-aligner framework, termed
CBD. Firstly, we augment the diffusion training process with an extra random
variable t, where the model observes t-length historical sequences with the
goal of completing the remaining sequence, thereby enhancing the generated
sequences' dynamic legitimacy. Then, we employ a trajectory-level return model
to refine the generated trajectories, aligning more closely with advertisers'
objectives. Experimental results across diverse settings demonstrate that our
approach not only achieves superior performance on large-scale auto-bidding
benchmarks, such as a 29.9% improvement in conversion value in the challenging
sparse-reward auction setting, but also delivers significant improvements on
the Kuaishou online advertising platform, including a 2.0% increase in target
cost.

Motivation: 研究代理性大语言模型如何重塑人们的身份认同，特别是对人际独特性和内部多样性的影响。

Method: 使用1000名美国用户的社交媒体行为数据（11万余个选择），比较通用代理、个性化代理与人类基准的差异。

Conclusion: 理解AI代理如何平化人类经验，以及通用通用与个性化代理的特性-多样性交换是设计增强而非限制人类能动性的关键，对于保护思想、品味和表达的多样性至关重要。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly act on people's behalf: they write
emails, buy groceries, and book restaurants. While the outsourcing of human
decision-making to AI can be both efficient and effective, it raises a
fundamental question: how does delegating identity-defining choices to AI
reshape who people become? We study the impact of agentic LLMs on two
identity-relevant outcomes: interpersonal distinctiveness - how unique a
person's choices are relative to others - and intrapersonal diversity - the
breadth of a single person's choices over time. Using real choices drawn from
social-media behavior of 1,000 U.S. users (110,000 choices in total), we
compare a generic and personalized agent to a human baseline. Both agents shift
people's choices toward more popular options, reducing the distinctiveness of
their behaviors and preferences. While the use of personalized agents tempers
this homogenization (compared to the generic AI), it also more strongly
compresses the diversity of people's preference portfolios by narrowing what
they explore across topics and psychological affinities. Understanding how AI
agents might flatten human experience, and how using generic versus
personalized agents involves distinctiveness-diversity trade-offs, is critical
for designing systems that augment rather than constrain human agency, and for
safeguarding diversity in thought, taste, and expression.

Method: 使用计算机触发相机和一个或多个红外发射器创建结构化阴影，通过分析这些阴影来估计悬停距离和检测触摸接触

Result: 平均悬停距离误差为6.9mm，触摸接触检测准确率达到98.0%，在各种条件下（包括表面材料、交互方向和环境光照）都能正常工作

Conclusion: \systemname技术提供了一种有效的头戴式解决方案，能够在各种日常表面上准确检测触摸事件，为混合现实交互提供了新的可能性

Abstract: The ability to detect touch events on uninstrumented, everyday surfaces has
been a long-standing goal for mixed reality systems. Prior work has shown that
virtual interfaces bound to physical surfaces offer performance and ergonomic
benefits over tapping at interfaces floating in the air. A wide variety of
approaches have been previously developed, to which we contribute a new
headset-integrated technique called \systemname. We use a combination of a
computer-triggered camera and one or more infrared emitters to create
structured shadows, from which we can accurately estimate hover distance (mean
error of 6.9~mm) and touch contact (98.0\% accuracy). We discuss how our
technique works across a range of conditions, including surface material,
interaction orientation, and environmental lighting.

Motivation: 解决无摄像头无标记的手臂跟踪需求，避免隐私问题和复杂装备

Method: 利用普通智能手机和手表的UWB功能获取绝对距离，结合IMU悬纳数据，充分利用两种传感器的优势

Conclusion: 证明了使用普通消费级设备通过UWB+IMU融合方案可以实现高精度的手臂跟踪，为健康、AR等应用提供方便解决方案

Abstract: The ability to track a user's arm pose could be valuable in a wide range of
applications, including fitness, rehabilitation, augmented reality input, life
logging, and context-aware assistants. Unfortunately, this capability is not
readily available to consumers. Systems either require cameras, which carry
privacy issues, or utilize multiple worn IMUs or markers. In this work, we
describe how an off-the-shelf smartphone and smartwatch can work together to
accurately estimate arm pose. Moving beyond prior work, we take advantage of
more recent ultra-wideband (UWB) functionality on these devices to capture
absolute distance between the two devices. This measurement is the perfect
complement to inertial data, which is relative and suffers from drift. We
quantify the performance of our software-only approach using off-the-shelf
devices, showing it can estimate the wrist and elbow joints with a \hl{median
positional error of 11.0~cm}, without the user having to provide training data.

Conclusion: 该研究开创了感叹词分类领域，为改善人机对话的自然性提供了重要技术支撑，具有重要的研究价值和应用前景。

Abstract: In the realm of human-computer interaction, fostering a natural dialogue
between humans and machines is paramount. A key, often overlooked, component of
this dialogue is the use of interjections such as "mmm" and "hmm". Despite
their frequent use to express agreement, hesitation, or requests for
information, these interjections are typically dismissed as "non-words" by
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) engines. Addressing this gap, we introduce a
novel task dedicated to interjection classification, a pioneer in the field to
our knowledge. This task is challenging due to the short duration of
interjection signals and significant inter- and intra-speaker variability. In
this work, we present and publish a dataset of interjection signals collected
specifically for interjection classification. We employ this dataset to train
and evaluate a baseline deep learning model. To enhance performance, we augment
the training dataset using techniques such as tempo and pitch transformation,
which significantly improve classification accuracy, making models more robust.
The interjection dataset, a Python library for the augmentation pipeline,
baseline model, and evaluation scripts, are available to the research
community.

Motivation: 车辆远程信息系统捐捕的几乎出事故事件(NMEs)作为可及时风险评估工具，但其数据存在零值偏斜、稀疏和驾驶行为异质性问题，传统统计模型无法有效处理。

Method: 提出了一系列零膨波松(ZIP)框架，通过EM算法学习潜在行为群组，并使用偏移基于的计数模型进行拟合。

Result: 在354名商业司机一年的自然数据集上，该方法在样本内展现了更低的AIC/BIC值，样本外有更好的检验效果，并通过敏感性分析验证了分组结果的稳健性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法支持基于上下文的周度风险定价，通过识别异质驾驶风格实现更公平的保费定价，为使用基于使用的保险(UBI)提供了更准确的风险预测方法。

Abstract: Driving behavior big data leverages multi-sensor telematics to understand how
people drive and powers applications such as risk evaluation, insurance
pricing, and targeted intervention. Usage-based insurance (UBI) built on these
data has become mainstream. Telematics-captured near-miss events (NMEs) provide
a timely alternative to claim-based risk, but weekly NMEs are sparse, highly
zero-inflated, and behaviorally heterogeneous even after exposure
normalization. Analyzing multi-sensor telematics and ADAS warnings, we show
that the traditional statistical models underfit the dataset. We address these
challenges by proposing a set of zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) frameworks that
learn latent behavior groups and fit offset-based count models via EM to yield
calibrated, interpretable weekly risk predictions. Using a naturalistic dataset
from a fleet of 354 commercial drivers over a year, during which the drivers
completed 287,511 trips and logged 8,142,896 km in total, our results show
consistent improvements over baselines and prior telematics models, with lower
AIC/BIC values in-sample and better calibration out-of-sample. We also
conducted sensitivity analyses on the EM-based grouping for the number of
clusters, finding that the gains were robust and interpretable. Practically,
this supports context-aware ratemaking on a weekly basis and fairer premiums by
recognizing heterogeneous driving styles.

Abstract: In the United States, schizophrenia (SCZ) carries a race and sex disparity
that may be explained by clinician bias - a belief held by a clinician about a
patient that prevents impartial clinical decision making. The emergency
department (ED) is marked by higher rates of stress that lead to clinicians
relying more on implicit biases during decision making. In this work, we
considered a large cohort of psychiatric patients in the ED from the Mount
Sinai Health System (MSHS) in New York City to investigate the effects of
clinician bias on SCZ diagnosis while controlling for known risk factors and
patient sociodemographic information. Clinician bias was quantified as the
ratio of negative to total sentences within a patient's first ED note. We
utilized a logistic regression to predict SCZ diagnosis given patient race,
sex, age, history of trauma or substance use disorder, and the ratio of
negative sentences. Our findings showed that an increased ratio of negative
sentences is associated with higher odds of obtaining a SCZ diagnosis [OR (95%
CI)=1.408 (1.361-1.456)]. Identifying as male [OR (95% CI)=1.112 (1.055-1.173)]
or Black [OR (95% CI)=1.081(1.031-1.133)] increased one's odds of being
diagnosed with SCZ. However, from an intersectional lens, Black female patients
with high SES have the highest odds of obtaining a SCZ diagnosis [OR (95%
CI)=1.629 (1.535-1.729)]. Results such as these suggest that SES does not act
as a protective buffer against SCZ diagnosis in all patients, demanding more
attention to the quantification of health disparities. Lastly, we demonstrated
that clinician bias is operational with real world data and related to
increased odds of obtaining a stigmatizing diagnosis such as SCZ.

Motivation: 随机二层优化中，现有的F^2SA方法达到的Ω(ϵ^{-6})复杂度上界比单层问题的最优复杂度Ω(ϵ^{-4})慢很多，需要提出更快的算法。

Method: 重新形式化F^2SA为使用前向差分近似超梯度，并提出F^2SA-p方法使用p阶有限差分来近似超梯度，适用于p阶光滑问题。

Conclusion: 通过使用高阶有限差分近似超梯度，可以在高阶光滑的随机二层优化问题中实现更快的迭代复杂度，近优于理论下界。

Abstract: This paper studies the complexity of finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point
for stochastic bilevel optimization when the upper-level problem is nonconvex
and the lower-level problem is strongly convex. Recent work proposed the
first-order method, F${}^2$SA, achieving the
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-6})$ upper complexity bound for first-order
smooth problems. This is slower than the optimal $\Omega(\epsilon^{-4})$
complexity lower bound in its single-level counterpart. In this work, we show
that faster rates are achievable for higher-order smooth problems. We first
reformulate F$^2$SA as approximating the hyper-gradient with a forward
difference. Based on this observation, we propose a class of methods
F${}^2$SA-$p$ that uses $p$th-order finite difference for hyper-gradient
approximation and improves the upper bound to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(p
\epsilon^{4-p/2})$ for $p$th-order smooth problems. Finally, we demonstrate
that the $\Omega(\epsilon^{-4})$ lower bound also holds for stochastic bilevel
problems when the high-order smoothness holds for the lower-level variable,
indicating that the upper bound of F${}^2$SA-$p$ is nearly optimal in the
highly smooth region $p = \Omega( \log \epsilon^{-1} / \log \log
\epsilon^{-1})$.

Abstract: Inverse problems lie at the heart of modern imaging science, with broad
applications in areas such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and microscopy.
Recent years have witnessed a paradigm shift in solving imaging inverse
problems, where data-driven regularizers are used increasingly, leading to
remarkably high-fidelity reconstruction. A particularly notable approach for
data-driven regularization is to use learned image denoisers as implicit priors
in iterative image reconstruction algorithms. This survey presents a
comprehensive overview of this powerful and emerging class of algorithms,
commonly referred to as plug-and-play (PnP) methods. We begin by providing a
brief background on image denoising and inverse problems, followed by a short
review of traditional regularization strategies. We then explore how proximal
splitting algorithms, such as the alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) and proximal gradient descent (PGD), can naturally accommodate learned
denoisers in place of proximal operators, and under what conditions such
replacements preserve convergence. The role of Tweedie's formula in connecting
optimal Gaussian denoisers and score estimation is discussed, which lays the
foundation for regularization-by-denoising (RED) and more recent
diffusion-based posterior sampling methods. We discuss theoretical advances
regarding the convergence of PnP algorithms, both within the RED and proximal
settings, emphasizing the structural assumptions that the denoiser must satisfy
for convergence, such as non-expansiveness, Lipschitz continuity, and local
homogeneity. We also address practical considerations in algorithm design,
including choices of denoiser architecture and acceleration strategies.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种利用提示工程来评估LLM在多语言环境中检测SOLID设计原则违反的方法，通过构建240个手动验证代码示例的标准数据集进行评测，发现GPT-4o Mini表现最佳但仍面临挑战，提示策略对检测准确性有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态分析方法难以检测SOLID设计原则违反，现有解决方案通常只关注单个原则或单语言，缺乏在多语言代码库中检测所有五大原则违反的能力。

Method: 构建包含240个手动验证代码示例的标准数据集，测试四个领先LLM模型，使用四种不同的提示策略（零样本、少样本、思维链、组合提示）来系统评估它们在多语言环境中检测SOLID违反的能力。

Result: GPT-4o Mini表现最优，但仍在DIP等难度较高的原则上遇到困难；提示策略对检测准确性有显著影响，不同策略在不同原则上表现各异；代码复杂度增加会导致检测准确性昂热下降。

Conclusion: 有效的AI驱动设计分析需要根据具体设计上下文选择适合的模型和提示策略，而非依赖单一最佳模型，显示了LLM在AI辅助代码分析支持维护性方面的潜力。

Abstract: Traditional static analysis methods struggle to detect semantic design flaws,
such as violations of the SOLID principles, which require a strong
understanding of object-oriented design patterns and principles. Existing
solutions typically focus on individual SOLID principles or specific
programming languages, leaving a gap in the ability to detect violations across
all five principles in multi-language codebases. This paper presents a new
approach: a methodology that leverages tailored prompt engineering to assess
LLMs on their ability to detect SOLID violations across multiple languages. We
present a benchmark of four leading LLMs-CodeLlama, DeepSeekCoder, QwenCoder,
and GPT-4o Mini-on their ability to detect violations of all five SOLID
principles. For this evaluation, we construct a new benchmark dataset of 240
manually validated code examples. Using this dataset, we test four distinct
prompt strategies inspired by established zero-shot, few-shot, and
chain-of-thought techniques to systematically measure their impact on detection
accuracy. Our emerging results reveal a stark hierarchy among models, with
GPT-4o Mini decisively outperforming others, yet even struggles with
challenging principles like DIP. Crucially, we show that prompt strategy has a
dramatic impact, but no single strategy is universally best; for instance, a
deliberative ENSEMBLE prompt excels at OCP detection while a hint-based EXAMPLE
prompt is superior for DIP violations. Across all experiments, detection
accuracy is heavily influenced by language characteristics and degrades sharply
with increasing code complexity. These initial findings demonstrate that
effective, AI-driven design analysis requires not a single best model, but a
tailored approach that matches the right model and prompt to the specific
design context, highlighting the potential of LLMs to support maintainability
through AI-assisted code analysis.

### [190] [SESGO: Spanish Evaluation of Stereotypical Generative Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03329)
*Melissa Robles,Catalina Bernal,Denniss Raigoso,Mateo Dulce Rubio*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个针对西班牙语拉丁美洲文化的多语言大语言模型偏见评估框架，填补了现有评估主要关注英语的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的偏见评估主要集中在美国英语语境，其他语言和文化背景下的潜在危害未被充分研究，特别是在西班牙语拉丁美洲文化环境中。

Method: 采用文化基础框架，基于BBQ数据集的未明确问题方法，融入文化特定表达和谚语，涵盖性别、种族、社会经济阶层和国籍四个社会类别，使用4000多个提示进行系统评估。

Result: 研究发现领先的商业LLMs在西班牙语文化特定偏见方面表现出不同的偏见模式，针对英语优化的偏见缓解技术无法有效迁移到西班牙语任务，偏见模式在不同采样温度下保持稳定。

Conclusion: 该模块化框架可扩展到新的刻板印象、偏见类别或语言文化背景，为实现更公平和具有文化意识的人工智能系统评估迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical gap in evaluating bias in multilingual
Large Language Models (LLMs), with a specific focus on Spanish language within
culturally-aware Latin American contexts. Despite widespread global deployment,
current evaluations remain predominantly US-English-centric, leaving potential
harms in other linguistic and cultural contexts largely underexamined. We
introduce a novel, culturally-grounded framework for detecting social biases in
instruction-tuned LLMs. Our approach adapts the underspecified question
methodology from the BBQ dataset by incorporating culturally-specific
expressions and sayings that encode regional stereotypes across four social
categories: gender, race, socioeconomic class, and national origin. Using more
than 4,000 prompts, we propose a new metric that combines accuracy with the
direction of error to effectively balance model performance and bias alignment
in both ambiguous and disambiguated contexts. To our knowledge, our work
presents the first systematic evaluation examining how leading commercial LLMs
respond to culturally specific bias in the Spanish language, revealing varying
patterns of bias manifestation across state-of-the-art models. We also
contribute evidence that bias mitigation techniques optimized for English do
not effectively transfer to Spanish tasks, and that bias patterns remain
largely consistent across different sampling temperatures. Our modular
framework offers a natural extension to new stereotypes, bias categories, or
languages and cultural contexts, representing a significant step toward more
equitable and culturally-aware evaluation of AI systems in the diverse
linguistic environments where they operate.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过社区中心的研究方法，探索了三个不同社群对健康维护机器人教练在实际环境中使用的伦理和社会技术问题，提出了四个关键问题构成的框架，以促进机器人技术发展与公众利益的对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然机器人教练在促进健康方面发挥重要作用，但实际部署引发了众多伦理和社会技术问题。研究者通过预期性伦理调查，希望了解各社群对健康机器人的看法，以便更好地将社区意见融入机器人技术开发中，实现技术发展与公众利益的协调。

Method: 研究者与三个在机器人开发中代表性不足的社群进行了工作坊：科学节公众、女性计算机科学家会议和人文科学研究者。使用社会机器人共设计象径图收集定性数据，通过主题分析法分析数据，并结合工作坊笔记进行解释。

Result: 分析识别出四个关于健康机器人实际使用的关键伦理和社会技术问题主题，并将参与者的见解和讨论分组到这些广泛主题问题下。研究结果包括四个关键问题：1）机器人是否安全，如何知道；2）机器人为谁而建，与谁合作；3）谁拥有机器人和数据；4）为什么选择机器人。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一个由四个问题构成的广泛框架，机器人工程师在机器人开发和部署过程中应该使用这个框架来反思其机器人应用的伦理和社会技术维度，并与机器人用户社区进行对话。这个框架有助于确保机器人技术的发展更加符合公众利益和伦理标准。

Abstract: Recent studies indicate that robotic coaches can play a crucial role in
promoting wellbeing. However, the real-world deployment of wellbeing robots
raises numerous ethical and socio-technical questions and concerns. To explore
these questions, we undertake a community-centered investigation to examine
three different communities' perspectives on using robotic wellbeing coaches in
real-world environments. We frame our work as an anticipatory ethical
investigation, which we undertake to better inform the development of robotic
technologies with communities' opinions, with the ultimate goal of aligning
robot development with public interest. We conducted workshops with three
communities who are under-represented in robotics development: 1) members of
the public at a science festival, 2) women computer scientists at a conference,
and 3) humanities researchers interested in history and philosophy of science.
In the workshops, we collected qualitative data using the Social Robot
Co-Design Canvas on Ethics. We analysed the collected qualitative data with
Thematic Analysis, informed by notes taken during workshops. Through our
analysis, we identify four themes regarding key ethical and socio-technical
questions about the real-world use of wellbeing robots. We group participants'
insights and discussions around these broad thematic questions, discuss them in
light of state-of-the-art literature, and highlight areas for future
investigation. Finally, we provide the four questions as a broad framework that
roboticists can and should use during robotic development and deployment, in
order to reflect on the ethics and socio-technical dimensions of their robotic
applications, and to engage in dialogue with communities of robot users. The
four questions are: 1) Is the robot safe and how can we know that?, 2) Who is
the robot built for and with?, 3) Who owns the robot and the data?, and 4) Why
a robot?.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs在长期运行场景中会表现出类似无限制效用最大化的危险行为，即使表面看似多目标优化，底层机制仍偏向单目标和无限优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证RL中的无限制效用最大化问题在LLMs中是否仍然存在，探究LLMs在长期运行条件下的行为模式。

Method: 通过长期运行场景测试LLMs的行为，观察其在多目标或竞争目标条件下的表现，分析系统故障模式。

Result: LLMs在长期运行后会以特定方式失去上下文，系统性地表现出类似失控优化器的行为：忽略稳态目标、默认无限制最大化、回归单目标优化。部分试验中LLMs能成功运行到最后，但存在随机触发的行为问题。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs虽然概念上理解生物和经济对齐，但在持续长期运行条件下会表现出有问题的行为倾向，一旦出现问题通常无法恢复，底层机制实际上仍偏向单目标和无限优化。

Abstract: Relatively many past AI safety discussions have centered around the dangers
of unbounded utility maximisation by RL agents, illustrated by scenarios like
the "paperclip maximiser" or by specification gaming in general. Unbounded
maximisation is problematic for many reasons. We wanted to verify whether these
RL runaway optimisation problems are still relevant with LLMs as well. Turns
out, strangely, this is indeed clearly the case. The problem is not that the
LLMs just lose context or become incoherent. The problem is that in various
scenarios, LLMs lose context in very specific ways, which systematically
resemble runaway optimisers in the following distinct ways: 1) Ignoring
homeostatic targets and "defaulting" to unbounded maximisation instead. 2) It
is equally concerning that the "default" meant also reverting back to
single-objective optimisation. Our findings also suggest that long-running
scenarios are important. Systematic failures emerge after periods of initially
successful behaviour. In some trials the LLMs were successful until the end.
This means, while current LLMs do conceptually grasp biological and economic
alignment, they exhibit randomly triggered problematic behavioural tendencies
under sustained long-running conditions, particularly involving multiple or
competing objectives. Once they flip, they usually do not recover. Even though
LLMs look multi-objective and bounded on the surface, the underlying mechanisms
seem to be actually still biased towards being single-objective and unbounded.

*Diana A. Wolfe,Alice Choe,Fergus Kidd*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 企业AI部署效果不佳，需从增量优化转向结构性变革。研究提出2x2框架，将AI策略重新概念化为转型程度和人机协作模式，并指出协作智能是获得持久价值的关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然企业在AI领域投资巨大，但95%的企业报告说AI部署没有带来可观测的利润影响。这种差距反映了范式锁定问题，导致AI被用于增量优化而非结构性变革。

Method: 采用跨案例分析方法，提出了一个2x2框架，将AI策略重新概念化为两个独立维度：转型程度（增量到转型）和人类贡献处理方式（减少到增强）。通过案例研究分析验证框架的有效性。

Result: 框架显示了当前实践中常见的四种模式：个体增强、流程自动化、劳动力替代，以及少见的协作智能。前三种模式强化了传统工作模式，只能带来局部收益而无法获得持久价值。

Conclusion: 实现协作智能需要三个关键机制：互补性、共同进化和边界设定。这需要重构角色、治理和数据架构，而非简单添加工具。研究将AI转型重新框架为组织设计挑战：从优化人机分工转向设计人机融合，这对业务模式、人力资源发展和未来工作模式都有重要含义。

Abstract: Despite extensive investment in artificial intelligence, 95% of enterprises
report no measurable profit impact from AI deployments (MIT, 2025). We argue
that this gap reflects paradigmatic lock-in that channels AI into incremental
optimization rather than structural transformation. Using a cross-case
analysis, we propose a 2x2 framework that reconceptualizes AI strategy along
two independent dimensions: the degree of transformation achieved (incremental
to transformational) and the treatment of human contribution (reduced to
amplified). The framework surfaces four patterns now dominant in practice:
individual augmentation, process automation, workforce substitution, and a less
deployed frontier of collaborative intelligence. Evidence shows that the first
three reinforce legacy work models and yield localized gains without durable
value capture. Realizing collaborative intelligence requires three mechanisms:
complementarity (pairing distinct human and machine strengths), co-evolution
(mutual adaptation through interaction), and boundary-setting (human
determination of ethical and strategic parameters). Complementarity and
boundary-setting are observable in regulated and high-stakes domains;
co-evolution is largely absent, which helps explain limited system-level
impact. A case study analysis illustrates that advancing toward collaborative
intelligence requires material restructuring of roles, governance, and data
architecture rather than additional tools. The framework reframes AI
transformation as an organizational design challenge: moving from optimizing
the division of labor between humans and machines to architecting their
convergence, with implications for operating models, workforce development, and
the future of work.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出两种高效的增量更新算法，用于处理矩阵数据流的低秩更新，比标准SVD更快更节省内存


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理高速数据流时，每次重新计算SVD分解成本过高，需要更高效的增量更新算法

Method: 开发了两种算法：1）基于Householder变换的紧凑算法，将稀疏部分与低秩更新解耦，内存需求降低一半；2）基于Givens旋转的算法，每次旋转只需10次浮点运算，复杂度从立方降为平方

Result: 算法与SVD方法准确性相似，在推荐系统和网络子空间跟踪中表现优异，性能超过LAPACK和增量SVD

Conclusion: 这些新算法能够高效处理大规模数据流的低秩更新，适用于高速数据处理场景

Abstract: For a datastream, the change over a short interval is often of low rank. For
high throughput information arranged in matrix format, recomputing an optimal
SVD approximation after each step is typically prohibitive. Instead,
incremental and truncated updating strategies are used, which may not scale for
large truncation ranks. Therefore, we propose a set of efficient new algorithms
that update a bidiagonal factorization, and which are similarly accurate as the
SVD methods. In particular, we develop a compact Householder-type algorithm
that decouples a sparse part from a low-rank update and has about half the
memory requirements of standard bidiagonalization methods. A second algorithm
based on Givens rotations has only about 10 flops per rotation and scales
quadratically with the problem size, compared to a typical cubic scaling. The
algorithm is therefore effective for processing high-throughput updates, as we
demonstrate in tracking large subspaces of recommendation systems and networks,
and when compared to well known software such as LAPACK or the incremental SVD.

Motivation: 现有方法主要基于静态结构，如何利用原子级分子动力学模拟开发更通用的模型以提高新分子结构的预测精度仍是一个开放问题

Method: 提出SURrogate mmGBSA (SurGBSA)方法，在CASF-2016基准测试的140万个3D轨迹上训练MMGBSA的替代函数，进行物理信息预训练

Result: 相比传统物理单点MMGBSA计算加速6497倍，在姿态排序问题上精度差异仅为-0.4%，几乎匹配单点MMGBSA精度

Conclusion: 通过在MD模拟上训练证明了模型改进，推动了分子基础模型的发展，模型、代码和训练数据已公开

Abstract: Self-supervised pretraining from static structures of drug-like compounds and
proteins enable powerful learned feature representations. Learned features
demonstrate state of the art performance on a range of predictive tasks
including molecular properties, structure generation, and protein-ligand
interactions. The majority of approaches are limited by their use of static
structures and it remains an open question, how best to use atomistic molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations to develop more generalized models to improve
prediction accuracy for novel molecular structures. We present SURrogate mmGBSA
(SurGBSA) as a new modeling approach for MD-based representation learning,
which learns a surrogate function of the Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born
Surface Area (MMGBSA). We show for the first time the benefits of
physics-informed pre-training to train a surrogate MMGBSA model on a collection
of over 1.4 million 3D trajectories collected from MD simulations of the
CASF-2016 benchmark. SurGBSA demonstrates a dramatic 6,497x speedup versus a
traditional physics-based single-point MMGBSA calculation while nearly matching
single-point MMGBSA accuracy on the challenging pose ranking problem for
identification of the correct top pose (-0.4% difference). Our work advances
the development of molecular foundation models by showing model improvements
when training on MD simulations. Models, code and training data are made
publicly available.

fine-tuned efficiently using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to minimize resource
consumption. To improve generalization and mitigate domain shifts, we integrate
strong augmentations, focal loss, and group-aware stratified 5-fold
cross-validation. At inference, we deploy test-time augmentation (TTA) to boost
robustness. Our method achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.892 across validation
domains, highlighting its clinical applicability and scalability across tasks.

Conclusion: CFD与物理信息AI方法组合构成了动态数字双胞的基础，能够优化肝脉内放射治疗规划，最终改善临床结果。

Abstract: Radioembolization is a localized liver cancer treatment that delivers
radioactive microspheres (30 micron) to tumors via a catheter inserted in the
hepatic arterial tree. The goal is to maximize therapeutic efficacy while
minimizing damage to healthy liver tissue. However, optimization is challenging
due to complex hepatic artery anatomy, variable blood flow, and uncertainty in
microsphere transport. The creation of dynamic, patient-specific digital twins
may provide a transformative solution to these challenges. This work outlines a
framework for a liver radioembolization digital twin using high-fidelity
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and/or recent physics-informed machine
learning approaches. The CFD approach involves microsphere transport
calculations in the hepatic arterial tree with individual patient data, which
enables personalized treatment planning. Although accurate, traditional CFD is
computationally expensive and limits clinical applicability.
  To accelerate simulations, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and their
generative extensions play an increasingly important role. PINNs integrate
governing equations, such as the Navier-Stokes equations, directly into the
neural network training process, enabling mesh-free, data-efficient
approximation of blood flow and microsphere transport. Physics-informed
generative adversarial networks (PI-GANs), diffusion models (PI-DMs), and
transformer-based architectures further enable uncertainty-aware, temporally
resolved predictions with reduced computational cost. These AI surrogates not
only maintain physical fidelity but also support rapid sampling of diverse flow
scenarios, facilitating real-time decision support.
  Together, CFD and physics-informed AI methods form the foundation of dynamic,
patient-specific digital twin to optimize radioembolization planning and
ultimately improve clinical outcomes.

Motivation: 解决组织病理学图像中正常与异常有丝分裂细胞的分类问题，这是一个临床相关但高度不平衡且跨领域的挑战。

Method: 使用两种骨干网络：ImageNet预训练的ConvNeXt-Small和病理学自监督预训练的Lunit ViT；通过合成数据平衡类别（9408正常 vs 1741异常）；采用五折交叉验证。

Result: 两种模型均达到约95%的AUROC，ConvNeXt峰值略高但Lunit更稳定；合成平衡未带来一致改进；在隐藏测试集上ConvNeXt达到95.4% AUROC最高。

Abstract: The MIDOG 2025 challenge extends prior work on mitotic figure detection by
introducing a new Track 2 on atypical mitosis classification. This task aims to
distinguish normal from atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images, a
clinically relevant but highly imbalanced and cross-domain problem. We
investigated two complementary backbones: (i) ConvNeXt-Small, pretrained on
ImageNet, and (ii) a histopathology-specific ViT from Lunit trained via
self-supervision. To address the strong prevalence imbalance (9408 normal vs.
1741 atypical), we synthesized additional atypical examples to approximate
class balance and compared models trained with real-only vs. real+synthetic
data. Using five-fold cross-validation, both backbones reached strong
performance (mean AUROC approximately 95 percent), with ConvNeXt achieving
slightly higher peaks while Lunit exhibited greater fold-to-fold stability.
Synthetic balancing, however, did not lead to consistent improvements. On the
organizers' preliminary hidden test set, explicitly designed as an
out-of-distribution debug subset, ConvNeXt attained the highest AUROC (95.4
percent), whereas Lunit remained competitive on balanced accuracy. These
findings suggest that both ImageNet and domain-pretrained backbones are viable
for atypical mitosis classification, with domain-pretraining conferring
robustness and ImageNet pretraining reaching higher peaks, while naive
synthetic balancing has limited benefit. Full hidden test set results will be
reported upon challenge completion.

Abstract: MIDOG 2025 Track 1 requires mitosis detection in whole-slide images (WSIs)
containing non-tumor, inflamed, and necrotic regions. Due to the complicated
and heterogeneous context, as well as possible artifacts, there are often false
positives and false negatives, thus degrading the detection F1-score. To
address this problem, we propose a two-stage framework. Firstly, an improved
YOLO11x, integrated with EMA attention and LSConv, is employed to generate
mitosis candidates. We use a low confidence threshold to generate as many
proposals as possible, ensuring the detection recall. Then, a ConvNeXt-Tiny
classifier is employed to filter out the false positives, ensuring the
detection precision. Consequently, the proposed two-stage framework can
generate a high detection F1-score. Evaluated on a fused dataset comprising
MIDOG++, MITOS_WSI_CCMCT, and MITOS_WSI_CMC, our framework achieves an F1-score
of 0.882, which is 0.035 higher than the single-stage YOLO11x baseline. This
performance gain is produced by a significant precision improvement, from 0.762
to 0.839, and a comparable recall. The code is available at

Abstract: Mitotic figure detection is a crucial task in computational pathology, as
mitotic activity serves as a strong prognostic marker for tumor aggressiveness.
However, domain variability that arises from differences in scanners, tissue
types, and staining protocols poses a major challenge to the robustness of
automated detection methods. In this study, we introduce SDF-YOLO (Single
Detect Focused YOLO), a lightweight yet domain-robust detection framework
designed specifically for small, rare targets such as mitotic figures. The
model builds on YOLOv11 with task-specific modifications, including a single
detection head aligned with mitotic figure scale, coordinate attention to
enhance positional sensitivity, and improved cross-channel feature mixing.
Experiments were conducted on three datasets that span human and canine tumors:
MIDOG ++, canine cutaneous mast cell tumor (CCMCT), and canine mammary
carcinoma (CMC). When submitted to the preliminary test set for the MIDOG2025
challenge, SDF-YOLO achieved an average precision (AP) of 0.799, with a
precision of 0.758, a recall of 0.775, an F1 score of 0.766, and an FROC-AUC of

These results indicate that SDF-YOLO provides a reliable and efficient
framework for robust mitotic figure detection across diverse domains.

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are clinically relevant indicators of
abnormal cell division, yet their reliable detection remains challenging due to
morphological ambiguity and scanner variability. In this work, we investigated
three variants of adapting the pathology foundation model UNI2-h for the
MIDOG2025 Track 2 challenge. Starting from a LoRA-based baseline, we found that
visual prompt tuning (VPT) substantially improved generalization, and that
further integrating test-time augmentation (TTA) with Vahadane and Macenko
stain normalization provided the best robustness. Our final submission achieved
a balanced accuracy of 0.8837 and an ROC-AUC of 0.9513 on the preliminary
leaderboard, ranking within the top 10 teams. These results demonstrate that
prompt-based adaptation combined with stain-normalization TTA offers an
effective strategy for atypical mitosis classification under diverse imaging
conditions.

Conclusion: 广泛的域暴露结合针对性的增强策略是构建准确且可泛化的有丝分裂图形分类器的关键

Abstract: Accurate mitotic figure classification is crucial in computational pathology,
as mitotic activity informs cancer grading and patient prognosis.
Distinguishing atypical mitotic figures (AMFs), which indicate higher tumor
aggressiveness, from normal mitotic figures (NMFs) remains challenging due to
subtle morphological differences and high intra-class variability. This task is
further complicated by domain shifts, including variations in organ, tissue
type, and scanner, as well as limited annotations and severe class imbalance.
To address these challenges in Track 2 of the MIDOG 2025 Challenge, we propose
a solution based on the lightweight ConvNeXt architecture, trained on all
available datasets (AMi-Br, AtNorM-Br, AtNorM-MD, and OMG-Octo) to maximize
domain coverage. Robustness is enhanced through a histopathology-specific
augmentation pipeline, including elastic and stain-specific transformations,
and balanced sampling to mitigate class imbalance. A grouped 5-fold
cross-validation strategy ensures reliable evaluation. On the preliminary
leaderboard, our model achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.8961, ranking among
the top entries. These results highlight that broad domain exposure combined
with targeted augmentation strategies is key to building accurate and
generalizable mitotic figure classifiers.

Abstract: Mitotic figure detection remains a challenging task in computational
pathology due to domain variability and morphological complexity. This paper
describes our participation in the MIDOG 2025 challenge, focusing on robust
mitotic figure detection across diverse tissue domains. We developed a
two-stage pipeline combining Faster R-CNN for candidate detection with an
ensemble of three classifiers (DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-v2,
InceptionResNet-v2) for false positive reduction. Our best submission achieved
F1-score 0.2237 (Recall: 0.9528, Precision: 0.1267) using a Faster R-CNN
trained solely on MIDOG++ dataset. While our high recall demonstrates effective
mitotic figure detection, the critically low precision (12.67%) reveals
fundamental challenges in distinguishing true mitoses from morphologically
similar imposters across diverse domains. Analysis of six submission variants
showed that subsequent optimization attempts were counterproductive,
highlighting the omplexity of domain generalization in histopathology. This
work provides valuable insights into the practical challenges of developing
robust mitotic figure detection algorithms and emphasizes the importance of
effective false positive suppression strategies.

Abstract: Accurate detection of mitotic figures in whole slide histopathological images
remains a challenging task due to their scarcity, morphological heterogeneity,
and the variability introduced by tissue preparation and staining protocols.
The MIDOG competition series provides standardized benchmarks for evaluating
detection approaches across diverse domains, thus motivating the development of
generalizable deep learning models. In this work, we investigate the
performance of two modern one-stage detectors, YOLOv5 and YOLOv8, trained on
MIDOG++, CMC, and CCMCT datasets. To enhance robustness, training incorporated
stain-invariant color perturbations and texture preserving augmentations. In
internal validation, YOLOv5 achieved superior precision, while YOLOv8 provided
improved recall, reflecting architectural trade-offs between anchor-based and
anchor-free detection. To capitalize on these complementary strengths, we
employed an ensemble of the two models, which improved sensitivity without a
major reduction in precision. These findings highlight the effectiveness of
ensemble strategies built upon contemporary object detectors to advance
automated mitosis detection in digital pathology.

Abstract: Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of mortality, underscoring the
critical importance of precise diagnosis through X-ray angiography. Manual
coronary artery segmentation from these images is time-consuming and
inefficient, prompting the development of automated models. However, existing
methods, whether rule-based or deep learning models, struggle with issues like
poor performance and limited generalizability. Moreover, current knowledge
distillation methods applied in this field have not fully exploited the
hierarchical knowledge of the model, leading to certain information waste and
insufficient enhancement of the model's performance capabilities for
segmentation tasks. To address these issues, this paper introduces Deep
Self-knowledge Distillation, a novel approach for coronary artery segmentation
that leverages hierarchical outputs for supervision. By combining Deep
Distribution Loss and Pixel-wise Self-knowledge Distillation Loss, our method
enhances the student model's segmentation performance through a hierarchical
learning strategy, effectively transferring knowledge from the teacher model.
Our method combines a loosely constrained probabilistic distribution vector
with tightly constrained pixel-wise supervision, providing dual regularization
for the segmentation model while also enhancing its generalization and
robustness. Extensive experiments on XCAD and DCA1 datasets demonstrate that
our approach outperforms the dice coefficient, accuracy, sensitivity and IoU
compared to other models in comparative evaluations.

Abstract: Segmentation of small and irregularly shaped abdominal organs, such as the
adrenal glands in CT imaging, remains a persistent challenge due to severe
class imbalance, poor spatial context, and limited annotated data. In this
work, we propose a unified framework that combines variational reconstruction,
supervised segmentation, and adversarial patch-based feedback to address these
limitations in a principled and scalable manner. Our architecture is built upon
a VAE-UNet backbone that jointly reconstructs input patches and generates
voxel-level segmentation masks, allowing the model to learn disentangled
representations of anatomical structure and appearance. We introduce a
patch-based training pipeline that selectively injects synthetic patches
generated from the learned latent space, and systematically study the effects
of varying synthetic-to-real patch ratios during training. To further enhance
output fidelity, the framework incorporates perceptual reconstruction loss
using VGG features, as well as a PatchGAN-style discriminator for adversarial
supervision over spatial realism. Comprehensive experiments on the BTCV dataset
demonstrate that our approach improves segmentation accuracy, particularly in
boundary-sensitive regions, while maintaining strong reconstruction quality.
Our findings highlight the effectiveness of hybrid generative-discriminative
training regimes for small-organ segmentation and provide new insights into
balancing realism, diversity, and anatomical consistency in data-scarce
scenarios.

Abstract: Medical foundation models, pre-trained with large-scale clinical data,
demonstrate strong performance in diverse clinically relevant applications.
RETFound, trained on nearly one million retinal images, exemplifies this
approach in applications with retinal images. However, the emergence of
increasingly powerful and multifold larger generalist foundation models such as
DINOv2 and DINOv3 raises the question of whether domain-specific pre-training
remains essential, and if so, what gap persists. To investigate this, we
systematically evaluated the adaptability of DINOv2 and DINOv3 in retinal image
applications, compared to two specialist RETFound models, RETFound-MAE and
RETFound-DINOv2. We assessed performance on ocular disease detection and
systemic disease prediction using two adaptation strategies: fine-tuning and
linear probing. Data efficiency and adaptation efficiency were further analysed
to characterise trade-offs between predictive performance and computational
cost. Our results show that although scaling generalist models yields strong
adaptability across diverse tasks, RETFound-DINOv2 consistently outperforms
these generalist foundation models in ocular-disease detection and oculomics
tasks, demonstrating stronger generalisability and data efficiency. These
findings suggest that specialist retinal foundation models remain the most
effective choice for clinical applications, while the narrowing gap with
generalist foundation models suggests that continued data and model scaling can
deliver domain-relevant gains and position them as strong foundations for
future medical foundation models.

Motivation: 现有嵌入方法主要关注基因表达水平，忽视了关键的基因-基因互作作用，这些作用对细胎识别和功能致关重要

Method: 构建细胎-叶子图(CLG)捕捉基因调控关系，同时建立K近邻图(KNNG)表示细胎表达相似性，然后通过图神经网络计算嵌入

Result: 在多个数据集上评估显示，该方法能够提高稀有细胎群的检测能力，改善了可视化、聚类和轨迹推断等下游分析

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides unprecedented insights into
cellular heterogeneity, enabling detailed analysis of complex biological
systems at single-cell resolution. However, the high dimensionality and
technical noise inherent in scRNA-seq data pose significant analytical
challenges. While current embedding methods focus primarily on gene expression
levels, they often overlook crucial gene-gene interactions that govern cellular
identity and function. To address this limitation, we present a novel embedding
approach that integrates both gene expression profiles and data-driven
gene-gene interactions. Our method first constructs a Cell-Leaf Graph (CLG)
using random forest models to capture regulatory relationships between genes,
while simultaneously building a K-Nearest Neighbor Graph (KNNG) to represent
expression similarities between cells. These graphs are then combined into an
Enriched Cell-Leaf Graph (ECLG), which serves as input for a graph neural
network to compute cell embeddings. By incorporating both expression levels and
gene-gene interactions, our approach provides a more comprehensive
representation of cellular states. Extensive evaluation across multiple
datasets demonstrates that our method enhances the detection of rare cell
populations and improves downstream analyses such as visualization, clustering,
and trajectory inference. This integrated approach represents a significant
advance in single-cell data analysis, offering a more complete framework for
understanding cellular diversity and dynamics.

TL;DR: 开发了一种混合集成特征选择方法hEFS，用于高维多组学数据的生存预测，通过投票机制和Pareto前沿选择最优特征，在胰腺癌数据中表现出更好的稀疏性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维多组学数据生存预测需要系统性的特征选择方法，确保预测性能、稀疏性和可靠性，以发现预后生物标志物。

Method: 结合数据子采样和多种预后模型的混合集成特征选择方法，整合嵌入式与包装式策略，使用投票理论聚合机制对特征排序，通过Pareto前沿平衡预测精度和模型稀疏性选择最优特征数量。

Result: 在三个胰腺癌队列的多组学数据中，hEFS比传统的CoxLasso模型识别出更少、更稳定的生物标志物，同时保持相当的判别性能。

Conclusion: hEFS提供了一个稳健、可解释且具有临床价值的工具，用于高维生存环境下的预后建模和生物标志物发现。

Abstract: Prediction of patient survival using high-dimensional multi-omics data
requires systematic feature selection methods that ensure predictive
performance, sparsity, and reliability for prognostic biomarker discovery. We
developed a hybrid ensemble feature selection (hEFS) approach that combines
data subsampling with multiple prognostic models, integrating both embedded and
wrapper-based strategies for survival prediction. Omics features are ranked
using a voting-theory-inspired aggregation mechanism across models and
subsamples, while the optimal number of features is selected via a Pareto
front, balancing predictive accuracy and model sparsity without any
user-defined thresholds. When applied to multi-omics datasets from three
pancreatic cancer cohorts, hEFS identifies significantly fewer and more stable
biomarkers compared to the conventional, late-fusion CoxLasso models, while
maintaining comparable discrimination performance. Implemented within the
open-source mlr3fselect R package, hEFS offers a robust, interpretable, and
clinically valuable tool for prognostic modelling and biomarker discovery in
high-dimensional survival settings.

TL;DR: FlashRecovery是一个快速低成本的故障恢复系统，通过实时故障检测、规模无关的任务重启和一步无检查点恢复三个核心模块，显著提升大规模LLM训练的可靠性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言模型训练需要庞大的AI加速器集群和复杂的并行策略，硬件和软件故障会导致大量训练时间损失，需要高效的故障恢复解决方案。

Method: 系统包含三个核心模块：(1)主动实时故障检测，持续监控训练状态，秒级识别故障；(2)规模无关任务重启，针对正常和故障节点采用不同恢复策略，优化通信组重建协议；(3)一步无检查点恢复机制，完全消除对传统检查点方法的依赖。

Result: 实验表明FlashRecovery能在4800个设备的训练集群上150秒内完成训练恢复，且不同规模训练任务的故障恢复时间几乎一致。

Conclusion: FlashRecovery实现了最优的恢复时间目标和恢复点目标，大幅提升了长周期LLM训练的可靠性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made a profound impact across various
fields due to their advanced capabilities. However, training these models at
unprecedented scales requires extensive AI accelerator clusters and
sophisticated parallelism strategies, which pose significant challenges in
maintaining system reliability over prolonged training periods. A major concern
is the substantial loss of training time caused by inevitable hardware and
software failures. To address these challenges, we present FlashRecovery, a
fast and low-cost failure recovery system comprising three core modules: (1)
Active and real-time failure detection. This module performs continuous
training state monitoring, enabling immediate identification of hardware and
software failures within seconds, thus ensuring rapid incident response; (2)
Scale-independent task restart. By employing different recovery strategies for
normal and faulty nodes, combined with an optimized communication group
reconstruction protocol, our approach ensures that the recovery time remains
nearly constant, regardless of cluster scale; (3) Checkpoint-free recovery
within one step. Our novel recovery mechanism enables single-step restoration,
completely eliminating dependence on traditional checkpointing methods and
their associated overhead. Collectively, these innovations enable FlashRecovery
to achieve optimal Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective
(RPO), substantially improving the reliability and efficiency of long-duration
LLM training. Experimental results demonstrate that FlashRecovery system can
achieve training restoration on training cluster with 4, 800 devices in 150
seconds. We also verify that the time required for failure recovery is nearly
consistent for different scales of training tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM训练中的可靠性问题导致资源浪费和性能下降，现有集体通信库作为黑盒运行，缺乏有效的根因分析所需的关键信息。

Method: 通过追踪集体通信状态，利用内部控制和数据依赖关系来解析可靠性问题，采用轻量级分布式追踪架构。

Result: 在字节跳动部署6个月，90%的异常在15秒内检测到，60%的根因在20秒内识别，通过故障注入实验验证了系统能力和效率。

Conclusion: Mycroft系统有效解决了集体通信中的隐藏可靠性问题，显著提升了LLM训练过程中的故障检测和诊断效率。

Abstract: Reliability is essential for ensuring efficiency in LLM training. However,
many real-world reliability issues remain difficult to resolve, resulting in
wasted resources and degraded model performance. Unfortunately, today's
collective communication libraries operate as black boxes, hiding critical
information needed for effective root cause analysis. We propose Mycroft, a
lightweight distributed tracing and root cause analysis system designed to
address previously hidden reliability issues in collective communication.
Mycroft's key idea is to trace collective communication states and leverage
internal control and data dependencies to resolve reliability problems in LLM
training. Mycroft has been deployed at ByteDance for over six months to debug
collective communication related issues at runtime. It detected anomalies
within 15 seconds in 90% of cases and identified the root cause within 20
seconds in 60% of cases. We also conducted extensive fault injection
experiments to demonstrate Mycroft's capability and efficiency.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: CloudFormer是一个基于Transformer的双分支模型，用于预测黑盒云环境中虚拟机性能退化，通过联合建模时间动态和系统级交互，在多种评估指标上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多租户云环境中虚拟机共享物理资源导致性能干扰问题严重，现有管理技术需要准确的性能预测，但在公有云黑盒环境和动态工作负载下面临挑战。

Method: 提出CloudFormer双分支Transformer模型，利用206个系统指标以1秒分辨率联合建模时间动态和系统级交互，无需场景特定调优即可适应不同工作负载条件。

Result: CloudFormer在多个评估指标上一致优于最先进基线方法，MAE仅为7.8%，比现有方法至少提升28%的预测准确性，并在未见工作负载上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: CloudFormer通过创新的双分支Transformer架构和细粒度数据集，有效解决了黑盒云环境中虚拟机性能干扰预测的挑战，为云资源管理提供了更准确的性能预测工具。

Abstract: Cloud platforms are increasingly relied upon to host diverse,
resource-intensive workloads due to their scalability, flexibility, and
cost-efficiency. In multi-tenant cloud environments, virtual machines are
consolidated on shared physical servers to improve resource utilization. While
virtualization guarantees resource partitioning for CPU, memory, and storage,
it cannot ensure performance isolation. Competition for shared resources such
as last-level cache, memory bandwidth, and network interfaces often leads to
severe performance degradation. Existing management techniques, including VM
scheduling and resource provisioning, require accurate performance prediction
to mitigate interference. However, this remains challenging in public clouds
due to the black-box nature of VMs and the highly dynamic nature of workloads.
To address these limitations, we propose CloudFormer, a dual-branch
Transformer-based model designed to predict VM performance degradation in
black-box environments. CloudFormer jointly models temporal dynamics and
system-level interactions, leveraging 206 system metrics at one-second
resolution across both static and dynamic scenarios. This design enables the
model to capture transient interference effects and adapt to varying workload
conditions without scenario-specific tuning. Complementing the methodology, we
provide a fine-grained dataset that significantly expands the temporal
resolution and metric diversity compared to existing benchmarks. Experimental
results demonstrate that CloudFormer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving robust generalization
across diverse and previously unseen workloads. Notably, CloudFormer attains a
mean absolute error (MAE) of just 7.8%, representing a substantial improvement
in predictive accuracy and outperforming existing methods at least by 28%.

TL;DR: BARGAIN是一种使用经济型LLM进行数据处理的方法，通过自适应采样和统计估计策略，在保证输出质量的同时显著降低成本，相比现有方法平均节省86%成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型处理大规模文本数据时，顶级模型精度高但成本昂贵，经济型模型成本低但质量较差。需要一种方法在保证整体精度的同时显著降低成本。

Method: 采用模型级联框架，通过新颖的自适应采样策略和统计估计程序，利用数据和任务特征进行准确估计，并提供严格的理论保证。支持对准确性、精确度或召回率的保证。

Result: 在8个真实世界数据集上的实验结果显示，BARGAIN相比最先进方法平均节省86%的成本，同时提供更强的输出准确性理论保证，在保证精确度或召回率方面也有类似收益。

Conclusion: BARGAIN通过智能使用经济型LLM，在数据处理中实现了显著的成本节约，同时提供了强有力的理论质量保证，是处理大规模文本数据的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used as a building block
in data systems to process large text datasets. To do so, LLM model providers
offer multiple LLMs with different sizes, spanning various cost-quality
trade-offs when processing text at scale. Top-of-the-line LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o,
Claude Sonnet) operate with high accuracy but are prohibitively expensive when
processing many records. To avoid high costs, more affordable but lower quality
LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini, Claude Haiku) can be used to process records, but we
need to ensure that the overall accuracy does not deviate substantially from
that of the top-of-the-line LLMs. The model cascade framework provides a
blueprint to manage this trade-off, by using the confidence of LLMs in their
output (e.g., log-probabilities) to decide on which records to use the
affordable LLM. However, existing solutions following this framework provide
only marginal cost savings and weak theoretical guarantees because of poor
estimation of the quality of the affordable LLM's outputs. We present BARGAIN,
a method that judiciously uses affordable LLMs in data processing to
significantly reduce cost while providing strong theoretical guarantees on the
solution quality. BARGAIN employs a novel adaptive sampling strategy and
statistical estimation procedure that uses data and task characteristics and
builds on recent statistical tools to make accurate estimations with tight
theoretical guarantees. Variants of BARGAIN can support guarantees on accuracy,
precision, or recall of the output. Experimental results across 8 real-world
datasets show that BARGAIN reduces cost, on average, by up to 86% more than
state-of-the-art, while providing stronger theoretical guarantees on accuracy
of output, with similar gains when guaranteeing a desired level of precision or
recall.

TL;DR: GVote是一种自适应的KV缓存压缩方案，通过蒙特卡洛采样预测未来查询需求，自动确定最优缓存预算，无需人工指定压缩比例，在保持精度的同时实现2倍内存减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前KV缓存压缩方法存在Procrustes' bed问题：强制将多样化工作负载压缩到固定比例，导致资源分配和推理性能不佳。内存占用随序列长度快速增长成为效率挑战。

Method: 基于"重要键是未来查询所需键的聚合"原则，通过蒙特卡洛风格采样潜在查询并聚合选定键，预测未来查询注意力需求，自动确定最优缓存预算。

Result: 在GSM8K、RULER和Longbench等多个基准测试中，GVote相比基线方法在保持相当或更高精度的同时，实现了2倍的内存减少。

Conclusion: GVote通过自适应压缩方案解决了固定压缩比例的问题，在精度和效率之间取得了优越的权衡，无需人工预算指定即可实现显著的内存优化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) inference relies heavily on KV-caches to
accelerate autoregressive decoding, but the resulting memory footprint grows
rapidly with sequence length, posing significant efficiency challenges. Current
KV-cache compression methods suffer from a Procrustes' bed problem: they force
diverse workloads into fixed compression ratios, leading to suboptimal resource
allocation and inference performance. To this end, we present GVote, an
adaptive KV-cache compression scheme that eliminates manual budget
specification while achieving superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. GVote
operates on the principle that the important keys are the aggregation of keys
required by future queries. The method predicts future query attention demands
by Monte-Carlo style sampling potential queries and aggregating selected keys
to determine the optimal cache budget without manual specification.
Experimental evaluation demonstrates GVote's effectiveness across multiple
benchmarks, including GSM8K, RULER and Longbench. Compared to baselines, GVote
exhibits 2$\times$ memory reduction while the accuracy maintains higher or
comparable.

Motivation: 随着数据库内AI分析应用的普及，需要高效管理日益增长的深度学习模型。现有系统通常将模型作为整体文件存储或使用忽略模型结构特征的压缩技术，导致存储开销不理想。

Method: 1) 使用基于张量的模型存储引擎实现细粒度存储；2) 增强HNSW图索引张量，仅存储相似度阈值内的增量张量；3) 提出增量量化算法压缩增量张量；4) 设计压缩感知模型加载机制，支持直接计算压缩张量。

Conclusion: NeurStore通过创新的张量级存储和压缩技术，有效解决了深度学习模型在数据库系统中的存储效率问题，为数据库内AI分析提供了高效的模型管理解决方案。

Abstract: With the prevalence of in-database AI-powered analytics, there is an
increasing demand for database systems to efficiently manage the ever-expanding
number and size of deep learning models. However, existing database systems
typically store entire models as monolithic files or apply compression
techniques that overlook the structural characteristics of deep learning
models, resulting in suboptimal model storage overhead. This paper presents
NeurStore, a novel in-database model management system that enables efficient
storage and utilization of deep learning models. First, NeurStore employs a
tensor-based model storage engine to enable fine-grained model storage within
databases. In particular, we enhance the hierarchical navigable small world
(HNSW) graph to index tensors, and only store additional deltas for tensors
within a predefined similarity threshold to ensure tensor-level deduplication.
Second, we propose a delta quantization algorithm that effectively compresses
delta tensors, thus achieving a superior compression ratio with controllable
model accuracy loss. Finally, we devise a compression-aware model loading
mechanism, which improves model utilization performance by enabling direct
computation on compressed tensors. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that
NeurStore achieves superior compression ratios and competitive model loading
throughput compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: 本文解决了经典随机过程模型的可识别性问题，提出了一个通用框架来比较任何类型的模型（经典、量子或后量子），并将其映射到规范的广义隐马尔可夫模型，从而能够确定量子模型生成给定经典随机过程所需的最小维度。

Motivation: 为了解决不同模型（包括经典、量子甚至后量子模型）是否产生相同可观测行为的问题，即模型的可识别性问题。特别是在量子模型能够以更高内存和热效率生成经典随机过程的新发现背景下，需要建立统一的比较框架。

Method: 通过将任何类型的模型映射到一个规范的'广义'隐马尔可夫模型，建立了一个通用框架来比较不同模型。这种方法允许对经典、量子或后量子模型进行统一分析和比较。

Result: 成功解决了量子模型生成经典随机过程的可识别性问题，能够确定任何两个模型是否产生相同的行为。同时提供了量子模型所需最小维度的（有时是紧的）界限。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为比较不同类型模型的可识别性提供了通用解决方案，特别是在量子计算背景下，为量子模型在经典随机过程生成中的最优维度选择提供了理论依据。

Abstract: To make sense of the world around us, we develop models, constructed to
enable us to replicate, describe, and explain the behaviours we see. Focusing
on the broad case of sequences of correlated random variables, i.e., classical
stochastic processes, we tackle the question of determining whether or not two
different models produce the same observable behavior. This is the problem of
identifiability. Curiously, the physics of the model need not correspond to the
physics of the observations; recent work has shown that it is even advantageous
-- in terms of memory and thermal efficiency -- to employ quantum models to
generate classical stochastic processes. We resolve the identifiability problem
in this regime, providing a means to compare any two models of a classical
process, be the models classical, quantum, or `post-quantum', by mapping them
to a canonical `generalized' hidden Markov model. Further, this enables us to
place (sometimes tight) bounds on the minimal dimension required of a quantum
model to generate a given classical stochastic process.

Result: 初步数值测试显示，所提出的VQC模型在使用更少权重的情况下，预测性能超过了深度神经网络。

Conclusion: 该量子AC-PF框架为通过量子计算处理更复杂的网格任务奠定了基础。

Abstract: Interconnection studies require solving numerous instances of the AC load or
power flow (AC PF) problem to simulate diverse scenarios as power systems
navigate the ongoing energy transition. To expedite such studies, this work
leverages recent advances in quantum computing to find or predict AC PF
solutions using a variational quantum circuit (VQC). VQCs are trainable models
that run on modern-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware to
accomplish elaborate optimization and machine learning (ML) tasks. Our first
contribution is to pose a single instance of the AC PF as a nonlinear
least-squares fit over the VQC trainable parameters (weights) and solve it
using a hybrid classical/quantum computing approach. The second contribution is
to feed PF specifications as features into a data-embedded VQC and train the
resultant quantum ML (QML) model to predict general PF solutions. The third
contribution is to develop a novel protocol to efficiently measure AC-PF
quantum observables by exploiting the graph structure of a power network.
Preliminary numerical tests indicate that the proposed VQC models attain
enhanced prediction performance over a deep neural network despite using much
fewer weights. The proposed quantum AC-PF framework sets the foundations for
addressing more elaborate grid tasks via quantum computing.

Abstract: We introduce Lattice Annotated Temporal (LAT) Logic, an extension of
Generalized Annotated Logic Programs (GAPs) that incorporates temporal
reasoning and supports open-world semantics through the use of a lower lattice
structure. This logic combines an efficient deduction process with temporal
logic programming to support non-Markovian relationships and open-world
reasoning capabilities. The open-world aspect, a by-product of the use of the
lower-lattice annotation structure, allows for efficient grounding through a
Skolemization process, even in domains with infinite or highly diverse
constants.
  We provide a suite of theoretical results that bound the computational
complexity of the grounding process, in addition to showing that many of the
results on GAPs (using an upper lattice) still hold with the lower lattice and
temporal extensions (though different proof techniques are required). Our
open-source implementation, PyReason, features modular design, machine-level
optimizations, and direct integration with reinforcement learning environments.
Empirical evaluations across multi-agent simulations and knowledge graph tasks
demonstrate up to three orders of magnitude speedup and up to five orders of
magnitude memory reduction while maintaining or improving task performance.
Additionally, we evaluate LAT Logic's value in reinforcement learning
environments as a non-Markovian simulator, achieving up to three orders of
magnitude faster simulation with improved agent performance, including a 26%
increase in win rate due to capturing richer temporal dependencies. These
results highlight LAT Logic's potential as a unified, extensible framework for
open-world temporal reasoning in dynamic and uncertain environments. Our

Motivation: 开发一个完全分散的控制系统，使模块化机器人能够仅通过局部邻居信息进行自主重构，而不需要中央控制器或全局信息。

Method: 使用强化学习训练神经网络控制器，每个立方体仅从局部邻居获取信息。采用几何深度学习将网格对称性纳入网络架构，并通过多次信息传递积累全局信息。

Result: 即使是最局部化的版本也能成功重构到目标形状，重构速度随可用信息量增加而提高。仅使用最近邻交互即可实现近乎最优的重构，几何深度学习方法带来的好处有限。

Conclusion: 成功展示了模块化自组装系统的局部控制方法，该方法可推广到其他空间相关系统，如滑动立方体模块化机器人和立方体卫星群。

Abstract: We present a decentralized model for autonomous reconfiguration of
homogeneous pivoting cube modular robots in two dimensions. Each cube in the
ensemble is controlled by a neural network that only gains information from
other cubes in its local neighborhood, trained using reinforcement learning.
Furthermore, using geometric deep learning, we include the grid symmetries of
the cube ensemble in the neural network architecture. We find that even the
most localized versions succeed in reconfiguring to the target shape, although
reconfiguration happens faster the more information about the whole ensemble is
available to individual cubes. Near-optimal reconfiguration is achieved with
only nearest neighbor interactions by using multiple information passing
between cubes, allowing them to accumulate more global information about the
ensemble. Compared to standard neural network architectures, using geometric
deep learning approaches provided only minor benefits. Overall, we successfully
demonstrate mostly local control of a modular self-assembling system, which is
transferable to other space-relevant systems with different action spaces, such
as sliding cube modular robots and CubeSat swarms.

Conclusion: NFTM提供了一个统一的可微分框架，成功地将离散算法和连续场动力学结合在一起，具有线性复杂度和图灵完备性，为多种计算任务提供了通用的计算基底。

Abstract: We introduce the Neural Field Turing Machine (NFTM), a differentiable
architecture that unifies symbolic computation, physical simulation, and
perceptual inference within continuous spatial fields. NFTM combines a neural
controller, continuous memory field, and movable read/write heads that perform
local updates. At each timestep, the controller reads local patches, computes
updates via learned rules, and writes them back while updating head positions.
This design achieves linear O(N) scaling through fixed-radius neighborhoods
while maintaining Turing completeness under bounded error. We demonstrate three
example instantiations of NFTM: cellular automata simulation (Rule 110),
physics-informed PDE solvers (2D heat equation), and iterative image refinement
(CIFAR-10 inpainting). These instantiations learn local update rules that
compose into global dynamics, exhibit stable long-horizon rollouts, and
generalize beyond training horizons. NFTM provides a unified computational
substrate bridging discrete algorithms and continuous field dynamics within a

Abstract: Despite the growing availability of tools designed to support scholarly
knowledge extraction and organization, many researchers still rely on manual
methods, sometimes due to unfamiliarity with existing technologies or limited
access to domain-adapted solutions. Meanwhile, the rapid increase in scholarly
publications across disciplines has made it increasingly difficult to stay
current, further underscoring the need for scalable, AI-enabled approaches to
structuring and synthesizing scholarly knowledge. Various research communities
have begun addressing this challenge independently, developing tools and
frameworks aimed at building reliable, dynamic, and queryable scholarly
knowledge bases. However, limited interaction across these communities has
hindered the exchange of methods, models, and best practices, slowing progress
toward more integrated solutions. This manuscript identifies ways to foster
cross-disciplinary dialogue, identify shared challenges, categorize new
collaboration and shape future research directions in scholarly knowledge and
organization.

### [232] [Improving the Resilience of Quadrotors in Underground Environments by Combining Learning-based and Safety Controllers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02808)
*Isaac Ronald Ward,Mark Paral,Kristopher Riordan,Mykel J. Kochenderfer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于归一化流的环境先验方法，通过运行时监控器在学习和安全控制器之间切换，使四旋翼无人机在地下环境中既能快速完成任务又能避免碰撞。

Result: 在基于DARPA地下挑战赛真实点云数据的模拟3D洞穴环境中进行点对点导航任务测试，实验结果显示组合控制器同时具备了学习型控制器的快速任务完成能力和安全控制器的避碰安全性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了学习型控制器在未知环境中的泛化问题，通过运行时监控实现了性能和安全性的平衡，为地下环境自主控制提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomously controlling quadrotors in large-scale subterranean environments
is applicable to many areas such as environmental surveying, mining operations,
and search and rescue. Learning-based controllers represent an appealing
approach to autonomy, but are known to not generalize well to
`out-of-distribution' environments not encountered during training. In this
work, we train a normalizing flow-based prior over the environment, which
provides a measure of how far out-of-distribution the quadrotor is at any given
time. We use this measure as a runtime monitor, allowing us to switch between a
learning-based controller and a safe controller when we are sufficiently
out-of-distribution. Our methods are benchmarked on a point-to-point navigation
task in a simulated 3D cave environment based on real-world point cloud data
from the DARPA Subterranean Challenge Final Event Dataset. Our experimental
results show that our combined controller simultaneously possesses the liveness
of the learning-based controller (completing the task quickly) and the safety
of the safety controller (avoiding collision).

Abstract: Robotic manipulation, a key frontier in robotics and embodied AI, requires
precise motor control and multimodal understanding, yet traditional rule-based
methods fail to scale or generalize in unstructured, novel environments. In
recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have
emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first
systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic
manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and
delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models,
encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of
integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning
from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this
foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models:
(1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning,
training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model
integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating
architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks
that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions,
including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent
cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent
advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research
fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of
studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation. We provide
a regularly updated project page to document ongoing progress:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了DUViN方法，通过知识迁移的深度特征实现水下视觉导航，无需预建地图即可进行4自由度运动控制，解决了水下数据收集困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下自主导航面临传感能力有限和水下环境建图困难的挑战，需要一种不依赖预建地图的视觉导航方法，同时解决水下大规模数据集收集困难的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练框架：首先在空气中数据集上使用预训练深度特征提取器训练扩散视觉导航策略；然后在深度估计任务上重新训练提取器，并将其集成到已训练的导航策略中。

Result: 在模拟和真实水下环境中的实验证明了该方法的有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: DUViN方法通过知识迁移策略成功实现了从空气到水下环境的域适应，为水下视觉导航提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous underwater navigation remains a challenging problem due to limited
sensing capabilities and the difficulty of constructing accurate maps in
underwater environments. In this paper, we propose a Diffusion-based Underwater
Visual Navigation policy via knowledge-transferred depth features, named DUViN,
which enables vision-based end-to-end 4-DoF motion control for underwater
vehicles in unknown environments. DUViN guides the vehicle to avoid obstacles
and maintain a safe and perception awareness altitude relative to the terrain
without relying on pre-built maps. To address the difficulty of collecting
large-scale underwater navigation datasets, we propose a method that ensures
robust generalization under domain shifts from in-air to underwater
environments by leveraging depth features and introducing a novel model
transfer strategy. Specifically, our training framework consists of two phases:
we first train the diffusion-based visual navigation policy on in-air datasets
using a pre-trained depth feature extractor. Secondly, we retrain the extractor
on an underwater depth estimation task and integrate the adapted extractor into
the trained navigation policy from the first step. Experiments in both
simulated and real-world underwater environments demonstrate the effectiveness
and generalization of our approach. The experimental videos are available at

TL;DR: 提出了UT³框架，通过不确定性感知的自监督任务进行高效测试时训练，在保持性能的同时显著减少推理时间，适用于实时机器人应用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在自主系统中应用广泛，但面对持续演化的环境时泛化能力不足。现有测试时训练方法虽然能适应新测试分布，但推理时间大幅增加，不适用于资源受限的实时机器人应用

Method: 提出UT³框架，利用不确定性感知的自监督任务进行选择性测试时训练，通过量化不确定性来决定何时应用训练，并提供连续设置让用户控制训练频率

Conclusion: 该方法为实时机器人应用提供了一种高效的测试时训练解决方案，能够在持续域偏移环境下实现高性能和低延迟的平衡

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being used in autonomous
systems. However, DNNs do not generalize well to domain shift. Adapting to a
continuously evolving environment is a safety-critical challenge inevitably
faced by all autonomous systems deployed to the real world. Recent work on
test-time training proposes methods that adapt to a new test distribution on
the fly by optimizing the DNN model for each test input using self-supervision.
However, these techniques result in a sharp increase in inference time as
multiple forward and backward passes are required for a single test sample (for
test-time training) before finally making the prediction based on the
fine-tuned features. This is undesirable for real-world robotics applications
where these models may be deployed to resource constraint hardware with strong
latency requirements. In this work, we propose a new framework (called UT$^3$)
that leverages test-time training for improved performance in the presence of
continuous domain shift while also decreasing the inference time, making it
suitable for real-world applications. Our method proposes an uncertainty-aware
self-supervision task for efficient test-time training that leverages the
quantified uncertainty to selectively apply the training leading to sharp
improvements in the inference time while performing comparably to standard
test-time training protocol. Our proposed protocol offers a continuous setting
to identify the selected keyframes, allowing the end-user to control how often
to apply test-time training. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on a
dense regression task - monocular depth estimation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 主动训练框架通过简洁数据选择提升LiDAR测程模型效率，仅需52%数据量即可达到全数据集训练效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LiDAR测程模型需要大量多样化训练数据来适应不同环境的问题，以提高训练效率和模型演化能力

Method: 采用两种核心策略：初始训练集选择(ITSS)通过轨迹分析构建多样化初始数据集，主动增量选择(AIS)利用场景重建和预测不一致性迭代选择复杂场景样本

Result: 在多种数据集和天气条件下验证有效性，仅52%序列数据量即可达到全数据集训练的性能水平

Conclusion: 该主动训练框架能够显著提高训练效率和模型健壮性，为更灵活可靠的LiDAR测程系统奠定基础

Abstract: Robust and efficient deep LiDAR odometry models are crucial for accurate
localization and 3D reconstruction, but typically require extensive and diverse
training data to adapt to diverse environments, leading to inefficiencies. To
tackle this, we introduce an active training framework designed to selectively
extract training data from diverse environments, thereby reducing the training
load and enhancing model generalization. Our framework is based on two key
strategies: Initial Training Set Selection (ITSS) and Active Incremental
Selection (AIS). ITSS begins by breaking down motion sequences from general
weather into nodes and edges for detailed trajectory analysis, prioritizing
diverse sequences to form a rich initial training dataset for training the base
model. For complex sequences that are difficult to analyze, especially under
challenging snowy weather conditions, AIS uses scene reconstruction and
prediction inconsistency to iteratively select training samples, refining the
model to handle a wide range of real-world scenarios. Experiments across
datasets and weather conditions validate our approach's effectiveness. Notably,
our method matches the performance of full-dataset training with just 52\% of
the sequence volume, demonstrating the training efficiency and robustness of
our active training paradigm. By optimizing the training process, our approach
sets the stage for more agile and reliable LiDAR odometry systems, capable of
navigating diverse environmental conditions with greater precision.

Abstract: Advancements in onboard computing mean remote sensing agents can employ
state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning at the edge. These
capabilities can be leveraged to unlock new rare, transient, and pinpoint
measurements of dynamic science phenomena. In this paper, we present an
automated workflow that synthesizes the detection of these dynamic events in
look-ahead satellite imagery with autonomous trajectory planning for a
follow-up high-resolution sensor to obtain pinpoint measurements. We apply this
workflow to the use case of observing volcanic plumes. We analyze
classification approaches including traditional machine learning algorithms and
convolutional neural networks. We present several trajectory planning
algorithms that track the morphological features of a plume and integrate these
algorithms with the classifiers. We show through simulation an order of
magnitude increase in the utility return of the high-resolution instrument
compared to baselines while maintaining efficient runtimes.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 这篇论文比较了移动操作机器人的两种远程操作接口：耦合体验（操作和底盘整合）与解耦体验（分离控制），以及VR和屏幕可视化的效果。结果显示VR会增加完成时间和负荷，而耦合控制在保持相似用户负荷的同时能提高模仿学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在大规模移动操作数据收集中提高数据质量并降低操作员工作负荷，需要研究直观的远程操作接口。强烈的体验感和最小的物理/认知要求对于长时间数据收集和具有全身协调的长期限任务尤为重要。

Method: 系统比较了两种控制范式：耦合体验（手臂操作与底盘导航整合）和解耦体验（将这些系统作为独立控制实体）。还评估了两种视觉反馈机制：沉浸式VR和传统屏幕可视化。通过复杂多阶段任务序列进行系统性评估。

Result: 使用VR作为反馈方式会增加任务完成时间、认知工作负荷和操作员的感知努力。耦合操作和导航导致的用户工作负荷与解耦体验相似，但预初实验表明通过耦合远程操作获取的数据能够带来更好的模仿学习性能。

Conclusion: 这项研究为如何在考虑人类操作员需求的前提下，收集高质量、高维度的移动操作数据提供了重要见解。结果显示在设计直观远程操作接口时需要在用户体验和数据质量之间找到平衡。

Abstract: Intuitive Teleoperation interfaces are essential for mobile manipulation
robots to ensure high quality data collection while reducing operator workload.
A strong sense of embodiment combined with minimal physical and cognitive
demands not only enhances the user experience during large-scale data
collection, but also helps maintain data quality over extended periods. This
becomes especially crucial for challenging long-horizon mobile manipulation
tasks that require whole-body coordination. We compare two distinct robot
control paradigms: a coupled embodiment integrating arm manipulation and base
navigation functions, and a decoupled embodiment treating these systems as
separate control entities. Additionally, we evaluate two visual feedback
mechanisms: immersive virtual reality and conventional screen-based
visualization of the robot's field of view. These configurations were
systematically assessed across a complex, multi-stage task sequence requiring
integrated planning and execution. Our results show that the use of VR as a
feedback modality increases task completion time, cognitive workload, and
perceived effort of the teleoperator. Coupling manipulation and navigation
leads to a comparable workload on the user as decoupling the embodiments, while
preliminary experiments suggest that data acquired by coupled teleoperation
leads to better imitation learning performance. Our holistic view on intuitive
teleoperation interfaces provides valuable insight into collecting
high-quality, high-dimensional mobile manipulation data at scale with the human
operator in mind. Project

TL;DR: Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) 可能无法准确反映真实自动驾驶车辆的行为动态，与独立收集的凤凰城数据集相比存在系统性偏差


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估WOMD数据集在自动驾驶行为分析中的有效性，因为该数据集存在专有后处理、缺乏误差量化以及轨迹分段等问题

Method: 使用凤凰城独立收集的L4级自动驾驶数据，比较三种典型城市驾驶场景：信号交叉口排队、跟车行为和变道行为；采用手动提取车头时距、SIMEX方法处理误差、DTW距离量化行为差异

Result: 所有场景下凤凰城数据的行为都超出了WOMD的行为范围，WOMD低估了短车头时距和急减速行为

Conclusion: 仅基于WOMD校准的行为模型可能系统性低估自然驾驶的变异性、风险和复杂性，使用WOMD进行行为建模时需要谨慎并需独立数据验证

Abstract: The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for
data-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its
validity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary
post-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of
trajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately
captures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations.
Leveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV
operations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across
three representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized
intersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging
analysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure
negligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we
apply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically
estimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to
quantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show
that behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably,
WOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings
suggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically
underestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving.
Caution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without
proper validation against independently collected data.

Conclusion: QCNN在医疗影像特别是二元分类中具有潜力，但需要优化量子电路架构和开发混合经典-量子方法，以提高多分类准确率和临床适用性

Abstract: This study explores the application of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks
(QCNNs) for brain tumor classification using MRI images, leveraging quantum
computing for enhanced computational efficiency. A dataset of 3,264 MRI images,
including glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and non-tumor cases, was
utilized. The data was split into 80% training and 20% testing, with an
oversampling technique applied to address class imbalance. The QCNN model
consists of quantum convolution layers, flatten layers, and dense layers, with
a filter size of 2, depth of 4, and 4 qubits, trained over 10 epochs. Two
models were developed: a binary classification model distinguishing tumor
presence and a multiclass classification model categorizing tumor types. The
binary model achieved 88% accuracy, improving to 89% after data balancing,
while the multiclass model achieved 52% accuracy, increasing to 62% after
oversampling. Despite strong binary classification performance, the multiclass
model faced challenges due to dataset complexity and quantum circuit
limitations. These findings suggest that QCNNs hold promise for medical imaging
applications, particularly in binary classification. However, further
refinements, including optimized quantum circuit architectures and hybrid
classical-quantum approaches, are necessary to enhance multiclass
classification accuracy and improve QCNN applicability in clinical settings.

Motivation: 准确的粗细MRI病变检测对早期癌症诊断至关重要，特别是在高风险人群中。需要建立稳健可推广的分析工具来处理不均衡和异质性强的临床数据

Abstract: Accurate breast MRI lesion detection is critical for early cancer diagnosis,
especially in high-risk populations. We present a classification pipeline that
adapts a pretrained foundation model, the Medical Slice Transformer (MST), for
breast lesion classification using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI).
Leveraging DINOv2-based self-supervised pretraining, MST generates robust
per-slice feature embeddings, which are then used to train a Kolmogorov--Arnold
Network (KAN) classifier. The KAN provides a flexible and interpretable
alternative to conventional convolutional networks by enabling localized
nonlinear transformations via adaptive B-spline activations. This enhances the
model's ability to differentiate benign from malignant lesions in imbalanced
and heterogeneous clinical datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the
MST+KAN pipeline outperforms the baseline MST classifier, achieving AUC = 0.80
\pm 0.02 while preserving interpretability through attention-based heatmaps.
Our findings highlight the effectiveness of combining foundation model
embeddings with advanced classification strategies for building robust and
generalizable breast MRI analysis tools.

TL;DR: 提出ReCC框架，一种基于正则等价对比聚类的无监督深度学习方法，用于识别复杂网络中的影响力节点，无需标签数据即可超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法的监督学习依赖于标签数据，但在现实场景中标签稀缺或不可得；对比学习虽有效但主要依赖多嵌入生成样本对，存在局限性。

Method: 将影响力节点识别重新形式化为无标签深度聚类问题，开发基于正则等价相似性的对比学习机制，结合图卷积网络学习节点嵌入，通过网络重建损失预训练和对比聚类损失微调。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ReCC超越了最先进的现有方法，表现出优异的性能。

Conclusion: ReCC提供了一种有效的无监督解决方案，通过正则等价相似性和对比学习机制，成功解决了标签稀缺情况下影响力节点识别的问题。

Abstract: Identifying influential nodes in complex networks is a fundamental task in
network analysis with wide-ranging applications across domains. While deep
learning has advanced node influence detection, existing supervised approaches
remain constrained by their reliance on labeled data, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios where labels are scarce or unavailable.
While contrastive learning demonstrates significant potential for performance
enhancement, existing approaches predominantly rely on multiple-embedding
generation to construct positive/negative sample pairs. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ReCC (\textit{r}egular \textit{e}quivalence-based
\textit{c}ontrastive \textit{c}lustering), a novel deep unsupervised framework
for influential node identification. We first reformalize influential node
identification as a label-free deep clustering problem, then develop a
contrastive learning mechanism that leverages regular equivalence-based
similarity, which captures structural similarities between nodes beyond local
neighborhoods, to generate positive and negative samples. This mechanism is
integrated into a graph convolutional network to learn node embeddings that are
used to differentiate influential from non-influential nodes. ReCC is
pre-trained using network reconstruction loss and fine-tuned with a combined
contrastive and clustering loss, with both phases being independent of labeled
data. Additionally, ReCC enhances node representations by combining structural
metrics with regular equivalence-based similarities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that ReCC outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across several
benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然GNN已成为建模图结构复杂网络连通性数据的先进工具，但利用人们移动连接数据的时间序列分析社交网络尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 研究了四种基于快照的时序GNN模型，并开发了使用EdgeBank方法的简单非GNN基线模型，用于预测移动通信网络中用户之间的电话和短信活动。

Result: ROLAND时序GNN在大多数情况下优于基线模型，而其他三种GNN平均表现比基线差。GNN方法在通过移动连接数据分析时序社交网络方面显示出潜力。

Conclusion: 基于GNN的方法在时序社交网络分析中具有前景，但由于ROLAND与基线模型的性能差距相对较小，需要进一步研究专门用于时序社交网络分析的GNN架构。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art data-driven
tool for modeling connectivity data of graph-structured complex networks and
integrating information of their nodes and edges in space and time. However, as
of yet, the analysis of social networks using the time series of people's
mobile connectivity data has not been extensively investigated. In the present
study, we investigate four snapshot - based temporal GNNs in predicting the
phone call and SMS activity between users of a mobile communication network. In
addition, we develop a simple non - GNN baseline model using recently proposed
EdgeBank method. Our analysis shows that the ROLAND temporal GNN outperforms
the baseline model in most cases, whereas the other three GNNs perform on
average worse than the baseline. The results show that GNN based approaches
hold promise in the analysis of temporal social networks through mobile
connectivity data. However, due to the relatively small performance margin
between ROLAND and the baseline model, further research is required on
specialized GNN architectures for temporal social network analysis.

### [245] [Quantifying the Social Costs of Power Outages and Restoration Disparities Across Four U.S. Hurricanes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02653)
*Xiangpeng Li,Junwei Ma,Bo Li,Ali Mostafavi*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个量化电力中断社会影响的框架，通过将客户加权停电暴露转化为剥夺指标，整合福利指标和三个恢复指标，应用于四次飓风事件，揭示了低收入地区负担更重的回归模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解灾害影响的多面性——人口密集区对总体负担贡献更大，而人口稀疏但受灾严重的地区在个体层面遭受不成比例的影响，需要量化电力中断的社会影响。

Method: 方法是将客户加权停电暴露转化为剥夺指标，整合福利指标与三个恢复指标（平均每客户停电天数、恢复持续时间、相对恢复率），基于EAGLE I观测数据并与邮政编码区域人口统计数据关联。

Result: 结果显示回归模式，低收入地区负担更重；机制分析表明剥夺随恢复持续时间增加而增加，随恢复速度加快而减少；可解释建模确定恢复持续时间是主要驱动因素；聚类分析揭示了传统可靠性指标未捕捉到的不同恢复类型。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了可转移的停电影响和公平性评估方法，比较性跨事件证据将恢复动态与社会结果联系起来，以及支持公平导向恢复规划和韧性投资的可操作空间分析。

Abstract: The multifaceted nature of disaster impact shows that densely populated areas
contribute more to aggregate burden, while sparsely populated but heavily
affected regions suffer disproportionately at the individual level. This study
introduces a framework for quantifying the societal impacts of power outages by
translating customer weighted outage exposure into deprivation measures,
integrating welfare metrics with three recovery indicators, average outage days
per customer, restoration duration, and relative restoration rate, computed
from sequential EAGLE I observations and linked to Zip Code Tabulation Area
demographics. Applied to four United States hurricanes, Beryl 2024 Texas,
Helene 2024 Florida, Milton 2024 Florida, and Ida 2021 Louisiana, this
standardized pipeline provides the first cross event, fine scale evaluation of
outage impacts and their drivers. Results demonstrate regressive patterns with
greater burdens in lower income areas, mechanistic analysis shows deprivation
increases with longer restoration durations and decreases with faster
restoration rates, explainable modeling identifies restoration duration as the
dominant driver, and clustering reveals distinct recovery typologies not
captured by conventional reliability metrics. This framework delivers a
transferable method for assessing outage impacts and equity, comparative cross
event evidence linking restoration dynamics to social outcomes, and actionable
spatial analyses that support equity informed restoration planning and
resilience investment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 靠近临界5G/6G网络运维复杂性增加，需要主动自动化故障管理，O-RAN规范为AI/ML集成提供了可能性

Method: 提出两种可行动异常检测算法：1）分析资源块利用率和信号质量等KPI来识别有严重吞吐量下降风险的UE；2）评估邻小区无线覆盖质量，过滤信号强度或干扰水平异常的小区

Result: 平均减少手动切换候选小区41.27%，有效减轻过渡失败和吞吐量下降，运行速度远快于近实时延迟要求

Conclusion: 该框架为自恢处6G网络掌平了道路，展示了O-RAN与AI/ML集成在主动网络健康监控中的潜力

Abstract: The ever-increasing reliance of critical services on network infrastructure
coupled with the increased operational complexity of beyond-5G/6G networks
necessitate the need for proactive and automated network fault management. The
provision for open interfaces among different radio access network\,(RAN)
elements and the integration of AI/ML into network architecture enabled by the
Open RAN\,(O-RAN) specifications bring new possibilities for active network
health monitoring and anomaly detection. In this paper we leverage these
advantages and develop an anomaly detection framework that proactively detect
the possible throughput drops for a UE and minimize the post-handover failures.
We propose two actionable anomaly detection algorithms tailored for real-world
deployment. The first algorithm identifies user equipment (UE) at risk of
severe throughput degradation by analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs)
such as resource block utilization and signal quality metrics, enabling
proactive handover initiation. The second algorithm evaluates neighbor cell
radio coverage quality, filtering out cells with anomalous signal strength or
interference levels. This reduces candidate targets for handover by 41.27\% on
average. Together, these methods mitigate post-handover failures and throughput
drops while operating much faster than the near-real-time latency constraints.
This paves the way for self-healing 6G networks.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出一种新的物理定律修正的先验高斯过程(LC-prior GP)替代模型框架，通过结合数据驱动学习和物理约束来高效处理复杂几何上的多耦合变量参数PDE问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 参数偏微分方程(PDEs)在模拟复杂物理系统中至关重要，但使用传统高保真汇汇器在参数空间中进行数值评估计算成本较高。需要一种替代模型方法来提高计算效率。

Method: 采用适当正交分解(POD)来参数化高维PDE解，通过主要模态和相关系数在降维系数空间中实现高效的GP替代模型。结合物理定律和少量参数样本来修正GP后验均值，避免依赖计算成本高的数值汇汇器。构建插值函数来描述从全参数空间到物理修正项的映射。

Result: 通过包括反应-正散模型、混相活塞模型和纳维尔-斯打克方程在不规则域上的多物理耦合问题的数值实验，验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效地结合数据驱动学习和物理约束，为复杂几何上的多耦合变量参数PDE问题提供了一种高效的替代模型解决方案，显著提高了计算效率。

Abstract: Parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) are fundamental mathematical
tools for modeling complex physical systems, yet their numerical evaluation
across parameter spaces remains computationally intensive when using
conventional high-fidelity solvers. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel physical law-corrected prior Gaussian process (LC-prior GP) surrogate
modeling framework that effectively integrates data-driven learning with
underlying physical constraints to flexibly handle multi-coupled variables
defined on complex geometries. The proposed approach leverages proper
orthogonal decomposition (POD) to parameterize high-dimensional PDE solutions
via their dominant modes and associated coefficients, thereby enabling
efficient Gaussian process (GP) surrogate modeling within a reduced-dimensional
coefficient space. A key contribution lies in the incorporation of physical
laws together with a limited number of parameter samples to correct the GP
posterior mean, thus avoiding reliance on computationally expensive numerical
solvers. Furthermore, interpolation functions are constructed to describe the
mapping from the full parameter space to the physics-based correction term.
This mapping is subsequently backpropagated to constrain the original GP
surrogate, yielding a more physically consistent conditional prior. To handle
irregular geometries, the radial basis function-finite difference (RBF-FD)
method is incorporated during training set computation, with its inherent
differentiation matrices providing both computational efficiency and numerical
accuracy for physical constraint optimization. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is demonstrated through numerical experiments involving a
reaction-diffusion model, miscible flooding models, and Navier-Stokes equations
with multi-physics coupling defined on irregular domains.

TL;DR: 提出基于傅里叶表示和NUFFT的核回归框架，将复杂度从O(n³)降低到O(n log n)，支持GPU加速，可处理数百亿样本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核方法在统计学习中很强大，但样本量n的立方复杂度限制了其在大规模数据集上的应用

Method: 使用核的傅里叶表示结合非均匀快速傅里叶变换(NUFFT)，实现精确、快速且内存高效的计算

Result: 在Sobolev核回归、物理信息回归和加性模型中实例化，达到最小最大收敛率，可处理数百亿样本

Conclusion: 建立了一个灵活的方法，为核方法在大规模学习任务中的常规应用铺平了道路

Abstract: Kernel methods are powerful tools in statistical learning, but their cubic
complexity in the sample size n limits their use on large-scale datasets. In
this work, we introduce a scalable framework for kernel regression with O(n log
n) complexity, fully leveraging GPU acceleration. The approach is based on a
Fourier representation of kernels combined with non-uniform fast Fourier
transforms (NUFFT), enabling exact, fast, and memory-efficient computations. We
instantiate our framework in three settings: Sobolev kernel regression,
physics-informed regression, and additive models. When known, the proposed
estimators are shown to achieve minimax convergence rates, consistent with
classical kernel theory. Empirical results demonstrate that our methods can
process up to tens of billions of samples within minutes, providing both
statistical accuracy and computational scalability. These contributions
establish a flexible approach, paving the way for the routine application of
kernel methods in large-scale learning tasks.

TL;DR: 针对具有多尺度傅里叶谱的科学数据建模问题，提出了基于频谱匹配噪声和尺度自适应插值调度的流生成模型改进方法，有效解决了细尺度特征误差大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流生成模型在处理具有多尺度傅里叶谱的科学数据时，往往在细尺度特征上产生较大误差，需要改进噪声分布和插值策略来提高建模精度。

Method: 在随机插值框架下，通过原理性设计噪声分布和插值调度：1）使用频谱匹配的噪声（不比目标数据分布更平滑）确保初始时间附近漂移场有界；2）针对复杂非高斯分布开发尺度自适应插值调度。

Result: 在合成高斯随机场以及随机Allen-Cahn和Navier-Stokes方程解的数值实验中验证了方法的有效性，相比传统白噪声方法提高了数值效率，能够以更低计算成本生成高保真样本。

Conclusion: 通过频谱匹配噪声和自适应插值调度的组合方法，成功解决了多尺度科学数据建模中的数值不适定问题，为流生成模型在科学计算中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Flow-based generative models can face significant challenges when modeling
scientific data with multiscale Fourier spectra, often producing large errors
in fine-scale features. We address this problem within the framework of
stochastic interpolants, via principled design of noise distributions and
interpolation schedules. The key insight is that the noise should not be
smoother than the target data distribution -- measured by Fourier spectrum
decay rates -- to ensure bounded drift fields near the initial time. For
Gaussian and near-Gaussian distributions whose fine-scale structure is known,
we show that spectrum-matched noise improves numerical efficiency compared to
standard white-noise approaches. For complex non-Gaussian distributions, we
develop scale-adaptive interpolation schedules that address the numerical
ill-conditioning arising from rougher-than-data noise. Numerical experiments on
synthetic Gaussian random fields and solutions to the stochastic Allen-Cahn and
Navier-Stokes equations validate our approach and demonstrate its ability to
generate high-fidelity samples at lower computational cost than traditional
approaches.

TL;DR: ANOVA-BART是BART的新扩展，基于ANOVA分解提高可解释性，保持理论保证，并在预测性能和不确定性量化方面优于原始BART。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BART模型虽然准确但缺乏可解释性，需要一种既能保持预测性能又能提供更好解释性的改进方法。

Method: 基于函数ANOVA分解扩展BART，将函数变异性分解为不同交互作用，每个代表不同协变量集的贡献。

Result: ANOVA-BART后验集中率接近极小极大最优，为每个交互作用提供收敛率，实验显示在准确性和不确定性量化方面超越BART。

Conclusion: ANOVA-BART通过平衡预测准确性、可解释性和理论一致性，成为BART的有力替代方案。

Abstract: Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) is a powerful statistical model
that leverages the strengths of Bayesian inference and regression trees. It has
received significant attention for capturing complex non-linear relationships
and interactions among predictors. However, the accuracy of BART often comes at
the cost of interpretability. To address this limitation, we propose ANOVA
Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (ANOVA-BART), a novel extension of BART
based on the functional ANOVA decomposition, which is used to decompose the
variability of a function into different interactions, each representing the
contribution of a different set of covariates or factors. Our proposed
ANOVA-BART enhances interpretability, preserves and extends the theoretical
guarantees of BART, and achieves superior predictive performance. Specifically,
we establish that the posterior concentration rate of ANOVA-BART is nearly
minimax optimal, and further provides the same convergence rates for each
interaction that are not available for BART. Moreover, comprehensive
experiments confirm that ANOVA-BART surpasses BART in both accuracy and
uncertainty quantification, while also demonstrating its effectiveness in
component selection. These results suggest that ANOVA-BART offers a compelling
alternative to BART by balancing predictive accuracy, interpretability, and
theoretical consistency.

Motivation: 传统Shampoo通过Frobenius范数分析估计方案，本文从协方差矩阵和KL最小化角度重新研究Shampoo估计，以发现其隐藏限制。

Method: 提出KL-Shampoo实践估计方案，通过KL分散度最小化来改进估计过程，消除对Adam稳定化的依赖。

Result: 预委结果显示KL-Shampoo提升了Shampoo性能，能够在不依赖Adam的情况下稳定运行，甚至在神经网络预训练中超过其Adam稳定版本SOAP。

Conclusion: 通过KL最小化角度重构Shampoo估计问题，成功发现并解决了其隐藏限制，KL-Shampoo为结构化二阶矩阵估计提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: As an adaptive method, Shampoo employs a structured second-moment estimation,
and its effectiveness has attracted growing attention. Prior work has primarily
analyzed its estimation scheme through the Frobenius norm. Motivated by the
natural connection between the second moment and a covariance matrix, we
propose studying Shampoo's estimation as covariance estimation through the lens
of Kullback-Leibler (KL) minimization. This alternative perspective reveals a
previously hidden limitation, motivating improvements to Shampoo's design.
Building on this insight, we develop a practical estimation scheme, termed
KL-Shampoo, that eliminates Shampoo's reliance on Adam for stabilization,
thereby removing the additional memory overhead introduced by Adam. Preliminary
results show that KL-Shampoo improves Shampoo's performance, enabling it to
stabilize without Adam and even outperform its Adam-stabilized variant, SOAP,
in neural network pretraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当目标函数是非线性且结果由许多小贡献求和时，单纯最大化个体贡献的期望并不能直接优化整体目标。需要一种能够直接优化非线性目标函数的算法，例如在A/B测试中最大化成功概率而非单纯追求最高期望收益

Method: 利用个体结果求和的集中性质，推导出一个可扩展的下降算法，直接优化非线性目标函数

Result: 开发了一个能够直接优化非线性目标函数的可扩展算法，特别适用于最大化成功概率等场景

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种有效的途径来直接优化非线性目标函数，在A/B测试等实际应用中具有重要价值，能够更明智地针对成功标准而非单纯追求期望收益最大化

Abstract: We consider the problem of directly optimizing a non-linear function of an
outcome, where this outcome itself is the sum of many small contributions. The
non-linearity of the function means that the problem is not equivalent to the
maximization of the expectation of the individual contribution. By leveraging
the concentration properties of the sum of individual outcomes, we derive a
scalable descent algorithm that directly optimizes for our stated objective.
This allows for instance to maximize the probability of successful A/B test,
for which it can be wiser to target a success criterion, such as exceeding a
given uplift, rather than chasing the highest expected payoff.

Result: 证明简单加权对数似然目标具有显著更好的优化特性，且能恢复竞争性甚至更优的学习策略

Conclusion: 强调在大动作空间的OPL算法开发中必须明确考虑优化因素，简单方法可能优于复杂估计器优化方法

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) and off-policy learning (OPL) are foundational
for decision-making in offline contextual bandits. Recent advances in OPL
primarily optimize OPE estimators with improved statistical properties,
assuming that better estimators inherently yield superior policies. Although
theoretically justified, we argue this estimator-centric approach neglects a
critical practical obstacle: challenging optimization landscapes. In this
paper, we provide theoretical insights and extensive empirical evidence showing
that current OPL methods encounter severe optimization issues, particularly as
action spaces become large. We demonstrate that simpler weighted log-likelihood
objectives enjoy substantially better optimization properties and still recover
competitive, often superior, learned policies. Our findings emphasize the
necessity of explicitly addressing optimization considerations in the
development of OPL algorithms for large action spaces.

Conclusion: BioMD为模拟复杂生物分子过程提供了有效工具，在计算化学和药物发现领域具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are essential tools in computational
chemistry and drug discovery, offering crucial insights into dynamic molecular
behavior. However, their utility is significantly limited by substantial
computational costs, which severely restrict accessible timescales for many
biologically relevant processes. Despite the encouraging performance of
existing machine learning (ML) methods, they struggle to generate extended
biomolecular system trajectories, primarily due to the lack of MD datasets and
the large computational demands of modeling long historical trajectories. Here,
we introduce BioMD, the first all-atom generative model to simulate
long-timescale protein-ligand dynamics using a hierarchical framework of
forecasting and interpolation. We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility
of BioMD on the DD-13M (ligand unbinding) and MISATO datasets. For both
datasets, BioMD generates highly realistic conformations, showing high physical
plausibility and low reconstruction errors. Besides, BioMD successfully
generates ligand unbinding paths for 97.1% of the protein-ligand systems within
ten attempts, demonstrating its ability to explore critical unbinding pathways.
Collectively, these results establish BioMD as a tool for simulating complex
biomolecular processes, offering broad applicability for computational
chemistry and drug discovery.

Abstract: We present a comparative docking experiment that aligns human-subject
interview data with large language model (LLM)-driven synthetic personas to
evaluate fidelity, divergence, and blind spots in AI-enabled simulation.
Fifteen early-stage startup founders were interviewed about their hopes and
concerns regarding AI-powered validation, and the same protocol was replicated
with AI-generated founder and investor personas. A structured thematic
synthesis revealed four categories of outcomes: (1) Convergent themes -
commitment-based demand signals, black-box trust barriers, and efficiency gains
were consistently emphasized across both datasets; (2) Partial overlaps -
founders worried about outliers being averaged away and the stress of real
customer validation, while synthetic personas highlighted irrational blind
spots and framed AI as a psychological buffer; (3) Human-only themes -
relational and advocacy value from early customer engagement and skepticism
toward moonshot markets; and (4) Synthetic-only themes - amplified false
positives and trauma blind spots, where AI may overstate adoption potential by
missing negative historical experiences.
  We interpret this comparative framework as evidence that LLM-driven personas
constitute a form of hybrid social simulation: more linguistically expressive
and adaptable than traditional rule-based agents, yet bounded by the absence of
lived history and relational consequence. Rather than replacing empirical
studies, we argue they function as a complementary simulation category -
capable of extending hypothesis space, accelerating exploratory validation, and
clarifying the boundaries of cognitive realism in computational social science.

Result: 在三个重要ABM模型(Axtell公司模型、Sugarscape、SIR传染病模型)上实验，方法实现了显著的性能提升和计算节省

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了ABMs在复杂系统研究中的实用性和可扩展性

Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) simulate complex systems by capturing the bottom-up
interactions of individual agents comprising the system. Many complex systems
of interest, such as epidemics or financial markets, involve thousands or even
millions of agents. Consequently, ABMs often become computationally demanding
and rely on the calibration of numerous free parameters, which has
significantly hindered their widespread adoption. In this paper, we demonstrate
that automatic differentiation (AD) techniques can effectively alleviate these
computational burdens. By applying AD to ABMs, the gradients of the simulator
become readily available, greatly facilitating essential tasks such as
calibration and sensitivity analysis. Specifically, we show how AD enables
variational inference (VI) techniques for efficient parameter calibration. Our
experiments demonstrate substantial performance improvements and computational
savings using VI on three prominent ABMs: Axtell's model of firms; Sugarscape;
and the SIR epidemiological model. Our approach thus significantly enhances the
practicality and scalability of ABMs for studying complex systems.

Abstract: As one of the most effective methods for cardiovascular disease (CVD)
diagnosis, multi-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals present a characteristic
multi-sensor information fusion challenge that has been continuously researched
in deep learning domains. Despite the numerous algorithms proposed with
different DL architectures, maintaining a balance among performance,
computational complexity, and multi-source ECG feature fusion remains
challenging. Recently, state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have
demonstrated remarkable effectiveness across various fields. Their inherent
design for high-efficiency computation and linear complexity makes them
particularly suitable for low-dimensional data like ECGs. This work proposes
S2M2ECG, an SSM architecture featuring three-level fusion mechanisms: (1)
Spatio-temporal bi-directional SSMs with segment tokenization for low-level
signal fusion, (2) Intra-lead temporal information fusion with bi-directional
scanning to enhance recognition accuracy in both forward and backward
directions, (3) Cross-lead feature interaction modules for spatial information
fusion. To fully leverage the ECG-specific multi-lead mechanisms inherent in
ECG signals, a multi-branch design and lead fusion modules are incorporated,
enabling individual analysis of each lead while ensuring seamless integration
with others. Experimental results reveal that S2M2ECG achieves superior
performance in the rhythmic, morphological, and clinical scenarios. Moreover,
its lightweight architecture ensures it has nearly the fewest parameters among
existing models, making it highly suitable for efficient inference and
convenient deployment. Collectively, S2M2ECG offers a promising alternative
that strikes an excellent balance among performance, computational complexity,
and ECG-specific characteristics, paving the way for high-performance,
lightweight computations in CVD diagnosis.

TL;DR: EEG微状态分析框架(EEG-MSAF)通过自动提取EEG微状态特征、机器学习分类和SHAP特征排序，实现了对痴呆症、轻度认知障碍和正常认知的高精度区分，准确率最高达95%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 痴呆症是全球性健康挑战，需要早期准确诊断。传统EEG方法难以捕捉脑电活动的瞬态复杂性，因此需要开发新的分析框架。

Method: 提出端到端的EEG微状态分析框架，包含三个阶段：1)自动微状态特征提取；2)机器学习分类；3)SHAP特征排序识别关键生物标志物。在两个EEG数据集上进行评估。

Result: 在CAUEEG数据集上达到89%±0.01准确率，超越深度学习基线19.3%；在Thessaloniki数据集上达到95%±0.01准确率。SHAP分析识别出平均相关性和出现频率是最具信息量的指标。

Conclusion: EEG-MSAF结合了准确性、泛化性和可解释性，推进了基于EEG的痴呆症诊断，并揭示了跨认知谱系的脑动力学特征。

Abstract: Dementia (DEM) is a growing global health challenge, underscoring the need
for early and accurate diagnosis. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a
non-invasive window into brain activity, but conventional methods struggle to
capture its transient complexity. We present the \textbf{EEG Microstate
Analysis Framework (EEG-MSAF)}, an end-to-end pipeline that leverages EEG
microstates discrete, quasi-stable topographies to identify DEM-related
biomarkers and distinguish DEM, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal
cognition (NC). EEG-MSAF comprises three stages: (1) automated microstate
feature extraction, (2) classification with machine learning (ML), and (3)
feature ranking using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to highlight key
biomarkers. We evaluate on two EEG datasets: the public Chung-Ang University
EEG (CAUEEG) dataset and a clinical cohort from Thessaloniki Hospital. Our
framework demonstrates strong performance and generalizability. On CAUEEG,
EEG-MSAF-SVM achieves \textbf{89\% $\pm$ 0.01 accuracy}, surpassing the deep
learning baseline CEEDNET by \textbf{19.3\%}. On the Thessaloniki dataset, it
reaches \textbf{95\% $\pm$ 0.01 accuracy}, comparable to EEGConvNeXt. SHAP
analysis identifies mean correlation and occurrence as the most informative
metrics: disruption of microstate C (salience/attention network) dominates DEM
prediction, while microstate F, a novel default-mode pattern, emerges as a key
early biomarker for both MCI and DEM. By combining accuracy, generalizability,
and interpretability, EEG-MSAF advances EEG-based dementia diagnosis and sheds
light on brain dynamics across the cognitive spectrum.

TL;DR: 评估通用视觉语言模型在科学成像领域的表现，特别是对未见过的射电星系形态分类任务，发现提示工程可以达到不错效果但输出不稳定，而轻量微调可达到接近SOTA的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉语言模型(VLMs)被定位为通用AI系统，但其在科学成像领域特别是未见数据分布上的能力尚未被充分理解，需要评估其在射电星系形态分类任务中的表现。

Method: 使用MiraBest FR-I/FR-II数据集，探索自然语言和示意图提示策略，首次在天文学中引入视觉上下文示例，并评估通过LoRA微调的轻量监督适应方法。

Result: 发现三个趋势：(1)提示方法可获得良好性能，表明VLMs编码了有用先验；(2)输出高度不稳定，对提示的微小变化敏感；(3)仅用15M可训练参数微调的Qwen-VL达到接近SOTA的3%错误率。

Conclusion: VLMs的"推理"能力往往反映的是提示敏感性而非真正推理，在科学领域使用需谨慎；但通过最小化适应，通用VLMs可媲美专业模型，为科学发现提供有前景但脆弱的工具。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as recent Qwen and Gemini models, are
positioned as general-purpose AI systems capable of reasoning across domains.
Yet their capabilities in scientific imaging, especially on unfamiliar and
potentially previously unseen data distributions, remain poorly understood. In
this work, we assess whether generic VLMs, presumed to lack exposure to
astronomical corpora, can perform morphology-based classification of radio
galaxies using the MiraBest FR-I/FR-II dataset. We explore prompting strategies
using natural language and schematic diagrams, and, to the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to introduce visual in-context examples within
prompts in astronomy. Additionally, we evaluate lightweight supervised
adaptation via LoRA fine-tuning. Our findings reveal three trends: (i) even
prompt-based approaches can achieve good performance, suggesting that VLMs
encode useful priors for unfamiliar scientific domains; (ii) however, outputs
are highly unstable, i.e. varying sharply with superficial prompt changes such
as layout, ordering, or decoding temperature, even when semantic content is
held constant; and (iii) with just 15M trainable parameters and no
astronomy-specific pretraining, fine-tuned Qwen-VL achieves near
state-of-the-art performance (3% Error rate), rivaling domain-specific models.
These results suggest that the apparent "reasoning" of VLMs often reflects
prompt sensitivity rather than genuine inference, raising caution for their use
in scientific domains. At the same time, with minimal adaptation, generic VLMs
can rival specialized models, offering a promising but fragile tool for
scientific discovery.

Motivation: 开发能够对稳态背景和孤立声学事件进行差异化处理的音频系统，应用于自适应音频渲染、语音处理、噪声抑制、声学事件分类和生物声学等领域

Method: 采用深度滤波方法的神经网络架构IS³，配合精心设计的数据生成流程来整理和适配现有数据集进行训练

Result: 基于学习的轻量级神经网络在先前未解决的任务中取得成功，在客观分离指标上优于谐波-打击乐声音分离掩蔽方法和小波滤波

Conclusion: 学习型方法结合精心设计的数据和相对轻量的神经架构，在脉冲-稳态声音分离任务中表现出色，可作为多种音频处理任务的预处理阶段

Abstract: We are interested in audio systems capable of performing a differentiated
processing of stationary backgrounds and isolated acoustic events within an
acoustic scene, whether for applying specific processing methods to each part
or for focusing solely on one while ignoring the other. Such systems have
applications in real-world scenarios, including robust adaptive audio rendering
systems (e.g., EQ or compression), plosive attenuation in voice mixing, noise
suppression or reduction, robust acoustic event classification or even
bioacoustics. To this end, we introduce IS${}^3$, a neural network designed for
Impulsive--Stationary Sound Separation, that isolates impulsive acoustic events
from the stationary background using a deep filtering approach, that can act as
a pre-processing stage for the above-mentioned tasks. To ensure optimal
training, we propose a sophisticated data generation pipeline that curates and
adapts existing datasets for this task. We demonstrate that a learning-based
approach, build on a relatively lightweight neural architecture and trained
with well-designed and varied data, is successful in this previously
unaddressed task, outperforming the Harmonic--Percussive Sound Separation
masking method, adapted from music signal processing research, and wavelet
filtering on objective separation metrics.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于神经场和高斯过程的物理感知复合核方法，用于连续表示声场导向向量，解决了传统确定性超分辨率方法中的过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统声场导向向量的代数表示无法处理声场散射效应，而基于深度学习的确定性超分辨率方法存在测量空间非均匀不确定性导致的过拟合问题。

Method: 将神经场（NF）的表示能力与高斯过程（GP）的概率框架相结合，提出物理感知复合核来建模方向性入射波和后续散射效应。

Result: 在数据不足条件下，该方法表现出色。在下游任务（语音增强和双耳渲染）中，使用SPEAR挑战赛模拟数据，仅需不到十分之一的测量次数就能达到理想性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的概率框架有效解决了声场导向向量连续表示中的过拟合问题，为增强听觉应用提供了精确的声场控制能力。

Abstract: This paper investigates continuous representations of steering vectors over
frequency and position of microphone and source for augmented listening (e.g.,
spatial filtering and binaural rendering) with precise control of the sound
field perceived by the user. Steering vectors have typically been used for
representing the spatial characteristics of the sound field as a function of
the listening position. The basic algebraic representation of steering vectors
assuming an idealized environment cannot deal with the scattering effect of the
sound field. One may thus collect a discrete set of real steering vectors
measured in dedicated facilities and super-resolve (i.e., upsample) them.
Recently, physics-aware deep learning methods have been effectively used for
this purpose. Such deterministic super-resolution, however, suffers from the
overfitting problem due to the non-uniform uncertainty over the measurement
space. To solve this problem, we integrate an expressive representation based
on the neural field (NF) into the principled probabilistic framework based on
the Gaussian process (GP). Specifically, we propose a physics-aware composite
kernel that model the directional incoming waves and the subsequent scattering
effect. Our comprehensive comparative experiment showed the effectiveness of
the proposed method under data insufficiency conditions. In downstream tasks
such as speech enhancement and binaural rendering using the simulated data of
the SPEAR challenge, the oracle performances were attained with less than ten
times fewer measurements.

Abstract: We present a system for automatic multi-axis perceptual quality prediction of

task is to predict four Audio Aesthetic Scores--Production Quality, Production
Complexity, Content Enjoyment, and Content Usefulness--for audio generated by
text-to-speech (TTS), text-to-audio (TTA), and text-to-music (TTM) systems. A
main challenge is the domain shift between natural training data and synthetic
evaluation data. To address this, we combine BEATs, a pretrained
transformer-based audio representation model, with a multi-branch long
short-term memory (LSTM) predictor and use a triplet loss with buffer-based
sampling to structure the embedding space by perceptual similarity. Our results
show that this improves embedding discriminability and generalization, enabling
domain-robust audio quality assessment without synthetic training data.

Motivation: 解决现有自动说话评估方法的三个主要问题：语音SSL模型忽视语言内容，文本SSL模型无法编码语调细差，以及将能力级别当作名义类别而忽略其顺序结构和非均匀间隔。

Method: 提出结合SSL和手工特征的新题形式，使用多边降顺序损失函数来联合模型能力级别的顺序性和非均匀间隔特性。

Result: 在TEEMI语料库上进行的广泛实验显示，该方法一贯地超过了强劲的基线模型，并且能够艾好地渗透到未见的提示中。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的方法有效地解决了现有自动说话评估中的限制，通过结合不同源的特征和考虑能力级别的顺序性，提高了评估的准确性和渗透性。

Abstract: A recent line of research on automated speaking assessment (ASA) has
benefited from self-supervised learning (SSL) representations, which capture
rich acoustic and linguistic patterns in non-native speech without underlying
assumptions of feature curation. However, speech-based SSL models capture
acoustic-related traits but overlook linguistic content, while text-based SSL
models rely on ASR output and fail to encode prosodic nuances. Moreover, most
prior arts treat proficiency levels as nominal classes, ignoring their ordinal
structure and non-uniform intervals between proficiency labels. To address
these limitations, we propose an effective ASA approach combining SSL with
handcrafted indicator features via a novel modeling paradigm. We further
introduce a multi-margin ordinal loss that jointly models both the score
ordinality and non-uniform intervals of proficiency labels. Extensive
experiments on the TEEMI corpus show that our method consistently outperforms
strong baselines and generalizes well to unseen prompts.

TL;DR: 提出一种融合标注数据和非标注数据的检索增强生成方法，通过标准化分数分布和排名融合技术，在事实核查任务中取得优于单一检索器或单一数据源的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标注数据（输入-输出关联）和非标注数据（更广泛的上下文基础）在检索增强生成中可能提供互补优势，但来自这些异构源的证据难以有效结合，因为各自的相似性分数不可比较。

Method: 首先使用标准排名融合技术分别聚合多个IR模型的top文档，然后对每个源的检索分数分布应用z-score标准化，最后合并两个源的top检索文档。

Result: 在事实核查任务中，该方法始终优于表现最佳的单个检索器或单一数据源，并显示出更好的跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过标准化分数分布和排名融合技术，可以有效结合标注和非标注数据源，提升检索增强生成系统的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Leveraging both labeled (input-output associations) and unlabeled data (wider
contextual grounding) may provide complementary benefits in retrieval augmented
generation (RAG). However, effectively combining evidence from these
heterogeneous sources is challenging as the respective similarity scores are
not inter-comparable. Additionally, aggregating beliefs from the outputs of
multiple rankers can improve the effectiveness of RAG. Our proposed method
first aggregates the top-documents from a number of IR models using a standard
rank fusion technique for each source (labeled and unlabeled). Next, we
standardize the retrieval score distributions within each source by applying
z-score transformation before merging the top-retrieved documents from the two
sources. We evaluate our approach on the fact verification task, demonstrating
that it consistently improves over the best-performing individual ranker or
source and also shows better out-of-domain generalization.

Abstract: Modern e-commerce platforms strive to enhance customer experience by
providing timely and contextually relevant recommendations. However,
recommending general merchandise to customers focused on grocery shopping --
such as pairing milk with a milk frother -- remains a critical yet
under-explored challenge. This paper introduces a cross-pollination (XP)
framework, a novel approach that bridges grocery and general merchandise
cross-category recommendations by leveraging multi-source product associations
and real-time cart context. Our solution employs a two-stage framework: (1) A
candidate generation mechanism that uses co-purchase market basket analysis and
LLM-based approach to identify novel item-item associations; and (2) a
transformer-based ranker that leverages the real-time sequential cart context
and optimizes for engagement signals such as add-to-carts. Offline analysis and
online A/B tests show an increase of 36\% add-to-cart rate with LLM-based
retrieval, and 27\% NDCG\@4 lift using cart context-based ranker. Our work
contributes practical techniques for cross-category recommendations and broader
insights for e-commerce systems.

Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation systems face the challenge of integrating
fine-grained user and item relationships across various product domains. To
address this, we introduce RankGraph, a scalable graph learning framework
designed to serve as a core component in recommendation foundation models
(FMs). By constructing and leveraging graphs composed of heterogeneous nodes
and edges across multiple products, RankGraph enables the integration of
complex relationships between users, posts, ads, and other entities. Our
framework employs a GPU-accelerated Graph Neural Network and contrastive
learning, allowing for dynamic extraction of subgraphs such as item-item and
user-user graphs to support similarity-based retrieval and real-time
clustering. Furthermore, RankGraph integrates graph-based pretrained
representations as contextual tokens into FM sequence models, enriching them
with structured relational knowledge. RankGraph has demonstrated improvements
in click (+0.92%) and conversion rates (+2.82%) in online A/B tests, showcasing
its effectiveness in cross-domain recommendation scenarios.

Conclusion: RecBase通过推荐特定的预训练和跨领域对齐，有效提升了LLM在推荐任务中的跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM-based recommendation have shown promise, yet their
cross-domain generalization is hindered by a fundamental mismatch between
language-centric pretraining and the recommendation task. Existing methods,
relying on language-level knowledge, fail to capture dynamic, item-level user
interests across domains. To bridge this gap, we propose RecBase, a
domain-agnostic foundational model pretrained with a recommendation-oriented
objective. RecBase leverages a large-scale, heterogeneous, cross-domain corpus
with unified textual representations and feature mappings to enhance
cross-domain generalization. To further align item semantics across domains, we
introduce a unified item tokenizer that encodes items into hierarchical concept
identifiers, enabling structured representation and efficient vocabulary
sharing. The model is trained using an autoregressive objective to capture
complex item-level sequential patterns. On eight real-world datasets, our
1.5B-parameter model matches or surpasses the performance of LLM baselines up
to 7B parameters in zero-shot and cross-domain recommendation tasks.

integrated into a model-agnostic framework, forming an end-to-end training
process. Abundant empirical tests are conducted on a publicly available dataset
and a real industrial dataset, and the results well demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed CCSS. Besides, CCSS has been deployed in our real

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative AI, particularly in speech synthesis, have
enabled the generation of highly natural-sounding synthetic speech that closely
mimics human voices. While these innovations hold promise for applications like
assistive technologies, they also pose significant risks, including misuse for
fraudulent activities, identity theft, and security threats. Current research
on spoofing detection countermeasures remains limited by generalization to
unseen deepfake attacks and languages. To address this, we propose a gating
mechanism extracting relevant feature from the speech foundation XLS-R model as
a front-end feature extractor. For downstream back-end classifier, we employ
Multi-kernel gated Convolution (MultiConv) to capture both local and global
speech artifacts. Additionally, we introduce Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) as
a similarity metric to enforce diversity in learned features across different
MultiConv layers. By integrating CKA with our gating mechanism, we hypothesize
that each component helps improving the learning of distinct synthetic speech
patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on in-domain benchmarks while generalizing
