### [1] [Argument Quality Annotation and Gender Bias Detection in Financial Communication through Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08262)
*Alaa Alhamzeh,Mays Al Rebdawi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了三种先进LLM（GPT-4o、Llama 3.1和Gemma 2）在金融沟通中标注论证质量的能力，评估了其一致性和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融论证质量评估研究不足，但影响投资决策和公众信任，因此需要可靠且无偏的标注方法。

Method: 使用FinArgQuality数据集，评估LLM标注的一致性和对抗性别偏见的攻击，并在不同温度设置下实验。

Result: LLM标注比人类标注一致性更高，但仍存在性别偏见。

Conclusion: 研究为未来更可靠、经济高效且无偏的标注方法提供了建议。

Abstract: Financial arguments play a critical role in shaping investment decisions and
public trust in financial institutions. Nevertheless, assessing their quality
remains poorly studied in the literature. In this paper, we examine the
capabilities of three state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-4o, Llama 3.1, and Gemma 2 in
annotating argument quality within financial communications, using the
FinArgQuality dataset. Our contributions are twofold. First, we evaluate the
consistency of LLM-generated annotations across multiple runs and benchmark
them against human annotations. Second, we introduce an adversarial attack
designed to inject gender bias to analyse models responds and ensure model's
fairness and robustness. Both experiments are conducted across three
temperature settings to assess their influence on annotation stability and
alignment with human labels. Our findings reveal that LLM-based annotations
achieve higher inter-annotator agreement than human counterparts, though the
models still exhibit varying degrees of gender bias. We provide a multifaceted
analysis of these outcomes and offer practical recommendations to guide future
research toward more reliable, cost-effective, and bias-aware annotation
methodologies.

### [2] [TurQUaz at CheckThat! 2025: Debating Large Language Models for Scientific Web Discourse Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08265)
*Tarık Saraç,Selin Mergen,Mucahid Kutlu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的‘委员会辩论’方法，利用多个大型语言模型（LLMs）模拟学术讨论，以识别推文中的科学主张、科学研究的引用或科学实体的提及。该方法在检测科学研究引用方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过模拟学术讨论的方式，提高对推文中科学内容的识别准确性，尤其是在科学研究的引用检测方面。

Method: 探索了三种辩论方法：单辩论、团队辩论和委员会辩论，最终选择委员会辩论作为主要模型。

Result: 委员会辩论在检测科学研究引用方面排名第一，但在识别科学主张和科学实体提及方面表现较差。

Conclusion: 委员会辩论方法在特定任务（如检测科学研究引用）中表现优异，但在其他任务中仍需改进。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our work developed for the scientific web discourse
detection task (Task 4a) of CheckThat! 2025. We propose a novel council debate
method that simulates structured academic discussions among multiple large
language models (LLMs) to identify whether a given tweet contains (i) a
scientific claim, (ii) a reference to a scientific study, or (iii) mentions of
scientific entities. We explore three debating methods: i) single debate, where
two LLMs argue for opposing positions while a third acts as a judge; ii) team
debate, in which multiple models collaborate within each side of the debate;
and iii) council debate, where multiple expert models deliberate together to
reach a consensus, moderated by a chairperson model. We choose council debate
as our primary model as it outperforms others in the development test set.
Although our proposed method did not rank highly for identifying scientific
claims (8th out of 10) or mentions of scientific entities (9th out of 10), it
ranked first in detecting references to scientific studies.

### [3] [Heartificial Intelligence: Exploring Empathy in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08271)
*Victoria Williams,Benjamin Rosman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在认知共情任务中表现优于人类，但在情感共情上表现较差，适合提供客观的情感支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型在认知和情感共情方面的表现，以评估其作为虚拟伴侣的潜力。

Method: 使用标准化心理学测试比较小型和大型语言模型与人类在认知和情感共情任务中的表现。

Result: 大型语言模型在认知共情上优于人类，但在情感共情上显著低于人类。

Conclusion: 语言模型在认知共情上的优势使其适合提供虚拟陪伴和情感支持，同时避免了情感疲劳或偏见。

Abstract: Large language models have become increasingly common, used by millions of
people worldwide in both professional and personal contexts. As these models
continue to advance, they are frequently serving as virtual assistants and
companions. In human interactions, effective communication typically involves
two types of empathy: cognitive empathy (understanding others' thoughts and
emotions) and affective empathy (emotionally sharing others' feelings). In this
study, we investigated both cognitive and affective empathy across several
small (SLMs) and large (LLMs) language models using standardized psychological
tests. Our results revealed that LLMs consistently outperformed humans -
including psychology students - on cognitive empathy tasks. However, despite
their cognitive strengths, both small and large language models showed
significantly lower affective empathy compared to human participants. These
findings highlight rapid advancements in language models' ability to simulate
cognitive empathy, suggesting strong potential for providing effective virtual
companionship and personalized emotional support. Additionally, their high
cognitive yet lower affective empathy allows objective and consistent emotional
support without running the risk of emotional fatigue or bias.

### [4] [Real-time News Story Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08272)
*Tadej Škvorc,Nikola Ivačič,Sebastjan Hribar,Marko Robnik-Šikonja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种实时新闻故事识别方法，结合文本表示、聚类和在线主题建模技术，用于将新闻文章动态分配到特定故事中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升新闻监控系统的效率，通过实时识别和分类新闻文章，使其能够基于具体事件、地点和人物进行分组，而非仅依赖文本相似性或预定义主题。

Method: 结合多种文本表示方法（如BERTopic、DBStream和TextClust）以及聚类算法，动态分配新闻文章到故事中。

Result: 在斯洛文尼亚媒体一个月的新闻数据集上验证，结果显示该方法能生成符合人类评估的合理结果。

Conclusion: 提出的实时故事识别方法有效，适用于新闻监控系统，能够动态且准确地分类新闻文章。

Abstract: To improve the reading experience, many news sites organize news into topical
collections, called stories. In this work, we present an approach for
implementing real-time story identification for a news monitoring system that
automatically collects news articles as they appear online and processes them
in various ways. Story identification aims to assign each news article to a
specific story that the article is covering. The process is similar to text
clustering and topic modeling, but requires that articles be grouped based on
particular events, places, and people, rather than general text similarity (as
in clustering) or general (predefined) topics (as in topic modeling). We
present an approach to story identification that is capable of functioning in
real time, assigning articles to stories as they are published online. In the
proposed approach, we combine text representation techniques, clustering
algorithms, and online topic modeling methods. We combine various text
representation methods to extract specific events and named entities necessary
for story identification, showing that a mixture of online topic-modeling
approaches such as BERTopic, DBStream, and TextClust can be adapted for story
discovery. We evaluate our approach on a news dataset from Slovene media
covering a period of 1 month. We show that our real-time approach produces
sensible results as judged by human evaluators.

### [5] [TT-XAI: Trustworthy Clinical Text Explanations via Keyword Distillation and LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08273)
*Kristian Miok,Blaz Škrlj,Daniela Zaharie,Marko Robnik Šikonja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TT-XAI框架通过关键词蒸馏和LLM推理提升临床语言模型的分类性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床语言模型在处理长文本电子健康记录时预测和解释不可靠的问题。

Method: 使用关键词蒸馏优化BERT分类器性能，并通过关键词引导的LLM生成临床解释。

Result: 关键词增强方法在机器和人类可解释性上均表现更优。

Conclusion: TT-XAI为临床决策支持提供了可扩展的可信AI解决方案。

Abstract: Clinical language models often struggle to provide trustworthy predictions
and explanations when applied to lengthy, unstructured electronic health
records (EHRs). This work introduces TT-XAI, a lightweight and effective
framework that improves both classification performance and interpretability
through domain-aware keyword distillation and reasoning with large language
models (LLMs). First, we demonstrate that distilling raw discharge notes into
concise keyword representations significantly enhances BERT classifier
performance and improves local explanation fidelity via a focused variant of
LIME. Second, we generate chain-of-thought clinical explanations using
keyword-guided prompts to steer LLMs, producing more concise and clinically
relevant reasoning. We evaluate explanation quality using deletion-based
fidelity metrics, self-assessment via LLaMA-3 scoring, and a blinded human
study with domain experts. All evaluation modalities consistently favor the
keyword-augmented method, confirming that distillation enhances both machine
and human interpretability. TT-XAI offers a scalable pathway toward
trustworthy, auditable AI in clinical decision support.

### [6] [Distilling Knowledge from Large Language Models: A Concept Bottleneck Model for Hate and Counter Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08274)
*Roberto Labadie-Tamayo,Djordje Slijepčević,Xihui Chen,Adrian Jaques Böck,Andreas Babic,Liz Freimann,Christiane Atzmüller Matthias Zeppelzauer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种透明的方法（SCBM）用于自动识别仇恨和反仇恨言论，通过形容词作为可解释的瓶颈概念，结合轻量级分类器，在多个数据集上表现优异且具有高解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上仇恨言论的快速增长对社会产生了前所未有的影响，需要透明且自动化的检测方法。

Method: 使用形容词作为人类可解释的瓶颈概念，结合大型语言模型（LLMs）将文本映射到抽象形容词表示，再用轻量级分类器进行下游任务。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上平均宏F1得分为0.69，优于文献中最新结果，且融合形容词表示后性能提升1.8%。

Conclusion: 形容词概念表示是紧凑、可解释且有效的仇恨和反仇恨言论识别编码，并可扩展到其他NLP任务。

Abstract: The rapid increase in hate speech on social media has exposed an
unprecedented impact on society, making automated methods for detecting such
content important. Unlike prior black-box models, we propose a novel
transparent method for automated hate and counter speech recognition, i.e.,
"Speech Concept Bottleneck Model" (SCBM), using adjectives as
human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models
(LLMs) to map input texts to an abstract adjective-based representation, which
is then sent to a light-weight classifier for downstream tasks. Across five
benchmark datasets spanning multiple languages and platforms (e.g., Twitter,
Reddit, YouTube), SCBM achieves an average macro-F1 score of 0.69 which
outperforms the most recently reported results from the literature on four out
of five datasets. Aside from high recognition accuracy, SCBM provides a high
level of both local and global interpretability. Furthermore, fusing our
adjective-based concept representation with transformer embeddings, leads to a
1.8% performance increase on average across all datasets, showing that the
proposed representation captures complementary information. Our results
demonstrate that adjective-based concept representations can serve as compact,
interpretable, and effective encodings for hate and counter speech recognition.
With adapted adjectives, our method can also be applied to other NLP tasks.

### [7] [MLLM-CBench:A Comprehensive Benchmark for Continual Instruction Tuning of Multimodal LLMs with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08275)
*Haiyun Guo,ZhiYan Hou,Yu Chen,Jinghan He,Yandu Sun,Yuzhe Zhou,Shujing Guo,Kuan Zhu,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLLM-CTBench是一个用于评估多模态大语言模型持续指令调优的基准，包含多维评估、算法比较和精选任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有研究中缺乏系统化评估基准的问题，以推动多模态大语言模型的持续学习进展。

Method: 提出MLLM-CTBench，结合答案准确性和推理质量评估，比较八种持续学习算法和两种训练范式，并组织16个数据集。

Result: 发现模型通用能力越强越抗遗忘，推理链退化较慢，算法效果依赖模型能力和任务顺序，KL约束在强化学习中有效。

Conclusion: MLLM-CTBench为持续指令调优提供了严格标准和实用指导。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) rely on continual instruction tuning
to adapt to the evolving demands of real-world applications. However, progress
in this area is hindered by the lack of rigorous and systematic benchmarks. To
address this gap, we present MLLM-CTBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark
with three key contributions: (1) Multidimensional Evaluation: We combine final
answer accuracy with fine-grained CoT reasoning quality assessment, enabled by
a specially trained CoT evaluator; (2) Comprehensive Evaluation of Algorithms
and Training Paradigms: We benchmark eight continual learning algorithms across
four major categories and systematically compare reinforcement learning with
supervised fine-tuning paradigms; (3) Carefully Curated Tasks: We select and
organize 16 datasets from existing work, covering six challenging domains. Our
key findings include: (i) Models with stronger general capabilities exhibit
greater robustness to forgetting during continual learning; (ii) Reasoning
chains degrade more slowly than final answers, supporting the hierarchical
forgetting hypothesis; (iii) The effectiveness of continual learning algorithms
is highly dependent on both model capability and task order; (iv) In
reinforcement learning settings, incorporating KL-divergence constraints helps
maintain policy stability and plays a crucial role in mitigating forgetting.
MLLM-CTBench establishes a rigorous standard for continual instruction tuning
of MLLMs and offers practical guidance for algorithm design and evaluation.

### [8] [Evaluating Contrast Localizer for Identifying Causal Unitsin Social & Mathematical Tasks in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08276)
*Yassine Jamaa,Badr AlKhamissi,Satrajit Ghosh,Martin Schrimpf*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过对比定位器在大语言模型和视觉语言模型中识别与心理理论和数学推理任务相关的因果单元，发现低激活单元有时比高激活单元对性能影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索对比定位器在识别任务相关因果单元中的有效性，并验证其因果相关性。

Method: 使用对比刺激集定位高激活单元，并通过针对性消融评估其因果作用，比较不同单元对任务性能的影响。

Result: 低激活单元有时比高激活单元对性能影响更大，数学定位器单元对心理理论任务的负面影响更显著。

Conclusion: 对比定位器的因果相关性存疑，需要更广泛的刺激集和更准确的任务单元捕获方法。

Abstract: This work adapts a neuroscientific contrast localizer to pinpoint causally
relevant units for Theory of Mind (ToM) and mathematical reasoning tasks in
large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). Across 11 LLMs
and 5 VLMs ranging in size from 3B to 90B parameters, we localize top-activated
units using contrastive stimulus sets and assess their causal role via targeted
ablations. We compare the effect of lesioning functionally selected units
against low-activation and randomly selected units on downstream accuracy
across established ToM and mathematical benchmarks. Contrary to expectations,
low-activation units sometimes produced larger performance drops than the
highly activated ones, and units derived from the mathematical localizer often
impaired ToM performance more than those from the ToM localizer. These findings
call into question the causal relevance of contrast-based localizers and
highlight the need for broader stimulus sets and more accurately capture
task-specific units.

### [9] [Objective Metrics for Evaluating Large Language Models Using External Data Sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08277)
*Haoze Du,Richard Li,Edward Gehringer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用主观指标评估大型语言模型性能的框架，强调自动化与透明性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决主观评估方法的局限性，提供可扩展的性能评估方案。

Method: 利用文本材料、基准数据集和结构化评估流程，确保一致性和可重复性。

Result: 实现了对LLM输出的客观、可重复且偏差最小化的评估。

Conclusion: 该框架为教育、科学等高风险领域提供了一种有效的性能评估方法。

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical yet
challenging task, particularly when aiming to avoid subjective assessments.
This paper proposes a framework for leveraging subjective metrics derived from
the class textual materials across different semesters to assess LLM outputs
across various tasks. By utilizing well-defined benchmarks, factual datasets,
and structured evaluation pipelines, the approach ensures consistent,
reproducible, and bias-minimized measurements. The framework emphasizes
automation and transparency in scoring, reducing reliance on human
interpretation while ensuring alignment with real-world applications. This
method addresses the limitations of subjective evaluation methods, providing a
scalable solution for performance assessment in educational, scientific, and
other high-stakes domains.

### [10] [MinionsLLM: a Task-adaptive Framework For The Training and Control of Multi-Agent Systems Through Natural Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08283)
*Andres Garcia Rincon,Eliseo Ferrante*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MinionsLLM框架结合LLM、行为树和形式语法，实现多智能体系统的自然语言控制，并通过两种数据集生成方法提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中自然语言控制的复杂性和适应性挑战。

Method: 结合行为树和形式语法，提出两种数据集生成方法（Method A和B）优化LLM。

Result: Method B将语法有效性提升至92.6%，任务性能提高33%，小模型受益显著。

Conclusion: MinionsLLM为资源受限场景提供高效解决方案，开源框架支持未来研究。

Abstract: This paper presents MinionsLLM, a novel framework that integrates Large
Language Models (LLMs) with Behavior Trees (BTs) and Formal Grammars to enable
natural language control of multi-agent systems within arbitrary, user-defined
environments. MinionsLLM provides standardized interfaces for defining
environments, agents, and behavioral primitives, and introduces two synthetic
dataset generation methods (Method A and Method B) to fine-tune LLMs for
improved syntactic validity and semantic task relevance. We validate our
approach using Google's Gemma 3 model family at three parameter scales (1B, 4B,
and 12B) and demonstrate substantial gains: Method B increases syntactic
validity to 92.6% and achieves a mean task performance improvement of 33% over
baseline. Notably, our experiments show that smaller models benefit most from
fine-tuning, suggesting promising directions for deploying compact, locally
hosted LLMs in resource-constrained multi-agent control scenarios. The
framework and all resources are released open-source to support reproducibility
and future research.

*Denis Janiak,Jakub Binkowski,Albert Sawczyn,Bogdan Gabrys,Ravid Schwartz-Ziv,Tomasz Kajdanowicz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出ROUGE作为幻觉检测的评估指标与人类判断不一致，并提出需要语义感知的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的幻觉问题严重，但现有评估方法（如ROUGE）与人类判断不符，导致性能估计不准确。

Method: 通过人类研究和LLM-as-Judge等人类对齐的指标，评估现有幻觉检测方法的性能。

Result: ROUGE召回率高但精度极低，部分方法性能下降达45.9%；简单启发式方法可与复杂技术媲美。

Conclusion: 需采用语义感知的评估框架，以准确衡量幻觉检测方法的真实性能，确保LLM输出的可信度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet their tendency to hallucinate poses serious challenges for reliable
deployment. Despite numerous hallucination detection methods, their evaluations
often rely on ROUGE, a metric based on lexical overlap that misaligns with
human judgments. Through comprehensive human studies, we demonstrate that while
ROUGE exhibits high recall, its extremely low precision leads to misleading
performance estimates. In fact, several established detection methods show
performance drops of up to 45.9\% when assessed using human-aligned metrics
like LLM-as-Judge. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simple heuristics based
on response length can rival complex detection techniques, exposing a
fundamental flaw in current evaluation practices. We argue that adopting
semantically aware and robust evaluation frameworks is essential to accurately
gauge the true performance of hallucination detection methods, ultimately
ensuring the trustworthiness of LLM outputs.

*Farah Atif,Nursultan Askarbekuly,Kareem Darwish,Monojit Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了FiqhQA基准，评估LLM在伊斯兰教法学中的准确性和节制行为，发现GPT-4o准确性最高，但Gemini和Fanar在节制行为上表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在宗教领域的可靠性和准确性，尤其是伊斯兰教法学中的不同学派和语言差异。

Method: 使用FiqhQA基准，对LLM进行零样本和节制行为实验，涵盖阿拉伯语和英语。

Result: GPT-4o准确性最高，但Gemini和Fanar在节制行为上更优；阿拉伯语性能下降明显。

Conclusion: LLM在宗教应用中需任务特定评估和谨慎部署。

Abstract: Despite the increasing usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) in answering
questions in a variety of domains, their reliability and accuracy remain
unexamined for a plethora of domains including the religious domains. In this
paper, we introduce a novel benchmark FiqhQA focused on the LLM generated
Islamic rulings explicitly categorized by the four major Sunni schools of
thought, in both Arabic and English. Unlike prior work, which either overlooks
the distinctions between religious school of thought or fails to evaluate
abstention behavior, we assess LLMs not only on their accuracy but also on
their ability to recognize when not to answer. Our zero-shot and abstention
experiments reveal significant variation across LLMs, languages, and legal
schools of thought. While GPT-4o outperforms all other models in accuracy,
Gemini and Fanar demonstrate superior abstention behavior critical for
minimizing confident incorrect answers. Notably, all models exhibit a
performance drop in Arabic, highlighting the limitations in religious reasoning
for languages other than English. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to benchmark the efficacy of LLMs for fine-grained Islamic school
of thought specific ruling generation and to evaluate abstention for Islamic
jurisprudence queries. Our findings underscore the need for task-specific
evaluation and cautious deployment of LLMs in religious applications.

### [13] [Putnam-AXIOM: A Functional and Static Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08292)
*Aryan Gulati,Brando Miranda,Eric Chen,Emily Xia,Kai Fronsdal,Bruno Dumont,Elyas Obbad,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Putnam-AXIOM是一个新的数学推理基准，包含522个大学竞赛题目和100个变体，旨在解决现有基准的饱和和训练集污染问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs的数学推理基准已接近饱和，且受训练集污染影响，需要动态、抗污染的评估框架。

Method: 通过Putnam竞赛题目和程序化生成的变体构建基准，并引入Teacher-Forced Accuracy（TFA）评分方法。

Result: 最强模型在原始集上得分为41.9%，但在变体集上下降19.6%，表明存在记忆问题。

Conclusion: Putnam-AXIOM为LLMs提供了抗污染、动态的数学推理评估工具。

Abstract: Current mathematical reasoning benchmarks for large language models (LLMs)
are approaching saturation, with some achieving > 90% accuracy, and are
increasingly compromised by training-set contamination. We introduce
Putnam-AXIOM, a benchmark of 522 university-level competition problems drawn
from the prestigious William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, and
Putnam-AXIOM Variation, an unseen companion set of 100 functional variants
generated by programmatically perturbing variables and constants. The variation
protocol produces an unlimited stream of equally difficult, unseen instances --
yielding a contamination-resilient test bed. On the Original set, OpenAI's
o1-preview -- the strongest evaluated model -- scores 41.9%, but its accuracy
drops by 19.6% (46.8% relative decrease) on the paired Variations. The
remaining eighteen models show the same downward trend, ten of them with
non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals. These gaps suggest memorization and
highlight the necessity of dynamic benchmarks. We complement "boxed" accuracy
with Teacher-Forced Accuracy (TFA), a lightweight metric that directly scores
reasoning traces and automates natural language proof evaluations. Putnam-AXIOM
therefore provides a rigorous, contamination-resilient evaluation framework for
assessing advanced mathematical reasoning of LLMs. Data and evaluation code are
publicly available at https://github.com/brando90/putnam-axiom.

*Shuzhou Yuan,William LaCroix,Hardik Ghoshal,Ercong Nie,Michael Färber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoDAE框架通过Chain-of-Thought数据增强优化LLMs在教育场景中的表现，解决了其过早揭示答案、低适应性及情感操纵脆弱性等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现成的LLMs在教育场景中表现不佳，如过早揭示答案、缺乏对学生不确定性的适应性及易受情感操纵。

Method: 通过CoT数据增强和针对性对话设计，优化LLMs的适应性、推理能力和抗干扰性，并对四种开源LLMs进行微调。

Result: 微调后的模型在教育场景中表现更优，提供更合适的指导，支持推理过程，并有效避免过早答案揭示。

Conclusion: CoDAE框架显著提升了LLMs在教育场景中的适用性和效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as AI tutors due to
their scalability and potential for personalized instruction. However,
off-the-shelf LLMs often underperform in educational settings: they frequently
reveal answers too readily, fail to adapt their responses to student
uncertainty, and remain vulnerable to emotionally manipulative prompts. To
address these challenges, we introduce CoDAE, a framework that adapts LLMs for
educational use through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data augmentation. We collect
real-world dialogues between students and a ChatGPT-based tutor and enrich them
using CoT prompting to promote step-by-step reasoning and pedagogically aligned
guidance. Furthermore, we design targeted dialogue cases to explicitly mitigate
three key limitations: over-compliance, low response adaptivity, and threat
vulnerability. We fine-tune four open-source LLMs on different variants of the
augmented datasets and evaluate them in simulated educational scenarios using
both automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge assessments. Our results show that
models fine-tuned with CoDAE deliver more pedagogically appropriate guidance,
better support reasoning processes, and effectively resist premature answer
disclosure.

Conclusion: Mol-R1通过改进推理性能和可解释性，填补了长链思维推理模型在分子发现领域的不足。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), especially Explicit Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and QWQ, have demonstrated powerful reasoning
capabilities, achieving impressive performance in commonsense reasoning and
mathematical inference. Despite their effectiveness, Long-CoT reasoning models
are often criticized for their limited ability and low efficiency in
knowledge-intensive domains such as molecule discovery. Success in this field
requires a precise understanding of domain knowledge, including molecular
structures and chemical principles, which is challenging due to the inherent
complexity of molecular data and the scarcity of high-quality expert
annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mol-R1, a novel framework
designed to improve explainability and reasoning performance of R1-like
Explicit Long-CoT reasoning LLMs in text-based molecule generation. Our
approach begins with a high-quality reasoning dataset curated through Prior
Regulation via In-context Distillation (PRID), a dedicated distillation
strategy to effectively generate paired reasoning traces guided by prior
regulations. Building upon this, we introduce MoIA, Molecular Iterative
Adaptation, a sophisticated training strategy that iteratively combines
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) with Reinforced Policy Optimization (RPO),
tailored to boost the reasoning performance of R1-like reasoning models for
molecule discovery. Finally, we examine the performance of Mol-R1 in the
text-based molecule reasoning generation task, showing superior performance
against existing baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了形态对齐的标记化方法对语言模型性能的影响，发现形态对齐对性能有中等正面影响，但标记化算法（如BPE与Unigram）对下游任务影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决形态对齐标记化方法是否提升语言模型性能的争议，尤其是在形态复杂的语言中。

Method: 选择泰卢固语、印地语和英语进行实验，从标记化训练到下游任务评估，关注形态对齐和标记化质量。

Result: 形态对齐与句法任务性能呈中等正相关，但标记化算法影响更大；Unigram标记化表现最优。

Conclusion: 形态对齐对性能有贡献，但标记化算法的选择更为关键。

Abstract: Prior work on language modeling showed conflicting findings about whether
morphologically aligned approaches to tokenization improve performance,
particularly for languages with complex morphology. To investigate this, we
select a typologically diverse set of languages: Telugu (agglutinative), Hindi
(primarily fusional with some agglutination), and English (fusional). We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of language models -- starting from
tokenizer training and extending through the finetuning and downstream task
evaluation. To account for the consistent performance differences observed
across tokenizer variants, we focus on two key factors: morphological alignment
and tokenization quality. To assess morphological alignment of tokenizers in
Telugu, we create a dataset containing gold morpheme segmentations of 600
derivational and 7000 inflectional word forms.
  Our experiments reveal that better morphological alignment correlates
positively -- though moderately -- with performance in syntax-based tasks such
as Parts-of-Speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition and Dependency Parsing.
However, we also find that the tokenizer algorithm (Byte-pair Encoding vs.
Unigram) plays a more significant role in influencing downstream performance
than morphological alignment alone. Naive Unigram tokenizers outperform others
across most settings, though hybrid tokenizers that incorporate morphological
segmentation significantly improve performance within the BPE framework. In
contrast, intrinsic metrics like Corpus Token Count (CTC) and R\'enyi entropy
showed no correlation with downstream performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种轻量级DPO变体（Adaptive Margin-Sigmoid Loss和APO-hinge-zero），通过引入基于边界的优化目标和选择性更新机制，提升小规模LLM在性能不足时的对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小规模LLM在性能差距较大时难以对齐人类偏好，亟需轻量级解决方案。

Method: 提出Adaptive Margin-Sigmoid Loss和APO-hinge-zero方法，结合边界目标和选择性更新机制。

Result: APO-hinge-zero在AlpacaEval中胜率提升2.0点，长度控制胜率提升1.4点；在MT-Bench中STEM和人文任务表现突出。

Conclusion: 轻量级偏好目标修改可显著提升小规模LLM的对齐效果，为资源受限场景提供实用方案。

Abstract: Small large language models (LLMs) often face difficulties in aligning output
to human preferences, particularly when operating under severe performance
gaps. In this work, we propose two lightweight DPO-based variants -- Adaptive
Margin-Sigmoid Loss and APO-hinge-zero -- to better address underperformance
scenarios by introducing margin-based objectives and selective update
mechanisms.
  Our APO-hinge-zero method, which combines hinge-induced hard-example mining
with the chosen-focused optimization of APO-zero, achieves strong results. In
AlpacaEval, APO-hinge-zero improves the win rate by +2.0 points and the
length-controlled win rate by +1.4 points compared to the APO-zero baseline. In
MT-Bench, our methods maintain competitive performance in diverse categories,
particularly excelling in STEM and Humanities tasks.
  These results demonstrate that simple modifications to preference-based
objectives can significantly enhance small LLM alignment under resource
constraints, offering a practical path toward more efficient deployment.

*Lorenzo Tomaz,Judd Rosenblatt,Thomas Berry Jones,Diogo Schwerz de Lucena*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过物理学方法研究大型语言模型推理过程中隐藏状态的变化，发现一种类似能量的量在模型中几乎恒定，并提出了一种控制方法（Jacobian steering）以优化输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型隐藏状态的变化规律，以提升模型的可解释性和可控性。

Method: 分析了20个开源Transformer模型，提出了一种结合隐藏状态变化率和模型确定性的“能量”概念，并基于此开发了Jacobian steering控制方法。

Result: 随机权重模型比预训练模型更严格地保持“能量”恒定，训练使模型进入更快、更果断的状态。Jacobian steering在测试中提升了语义质量。

Conclusion: 通过物理学视角分析Transformer模型，为可解释性、异常检测和低风险控制提供了理论基础，有助于提升模型的预测性和与人类意图的一致性。

Abstract: We take a physics-based approach to studying how the internal hidden states
of large language models change from token to token during inference. Across 20
open-source transformer models (135M-3B parameters), we find that a quantity
combining the rate of change in hidden states and the model's next-token
certainty, analogous to energy in physics, remains nearly constant.
Random-weight models conserve this "energy" more tightly than pre-trained ones,
while training shifts models into a faster, more decisive regime with greater
variability. Using this "log-Lagrangian" view, we derive a control method
called Jacobian steering, which perturbs hidden states in the minimal way
needed to favor a target token. This approach maintained near-constant energy
in two tested models and produced continuations rated higher in semantic
quality than the models' natural outputs. Viewing transformers through this
mechanics lens offers a principled basis for interpretability, anomaly
detection, and low-risk steering. This could help make powerful models more
predictable and aligned with human intent.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型对齐方法（如RLHF）仅能反映平均用户偏好，无法捕捉多样化的个体偏好。

Method: 采用少样本比较回归方法，结合上下文学习和推理，基于细粒度属性比较响应选项。

Result: 提出的方法在可引导多元基准测试中表现优异，超越了多个基线方法和最新技术。

Conclusion: 该研究为多元对齐提供了新方向，推动了大语言模型在伦理AI中的公平和代表性应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are currently aligned using techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, these methods use
scalar rewards that can only reflect user preferences on average. Pluralistic
alignment instead seeks to capture diverse user preferences across a set of
attributes, moving beyond just helpfulness and harmlessness. Toward this end,
we propose a steerable pluralistic model based on few-shot comparative
regression that can adapt to individual user preferences. Our approach
leverages in-context learning and reasoning, grounded in a set of fine-grained
attributes, to compare response options and make aligned choices. To evaluate
our algorithm, we also propose two new steerable pluralistic benchmarks by
adapting the Moral Integrity Corpus (MIC) and the HelpSteer2 datasets,
demonstrating the applicability of our approach to value-aligned
decision-making and reward modeling, respectively. Our few-shot comparative
regression approach is interpretable and compatible with different attributes
and LLMs, while outperforming multiple baseline and state-of-the-art methods.
Our work provides new insights and research directions in pluralistic
alignment, enabling a more fair and representative use of LLMs and advancing
the state-of-the-art in ethical AI.

Motivation: 开发一种高效的令牌压缩方法，以减少计算和存储需求，同时保持下游任务性能。

Method: 使用预训练的编码器-解码器语言模型，通过去噪训练生成高质量压缩表示，并优化编码器以最大化压缩质量。

Result: 在2倍压缩下，DeCAL性能接近未压缩模型；在8倍压缩下，性能下降较小。适用于问答、摘要和多向量检索任务。

Conclusion: DeCAL在预计算密集表示场景中节省显著，未来可进一步扩展其适用性。

Abstract: This paper introduces DeCAL, a new method for tokenwise compression. DeCAL
uses an encoder-decoder language model pretrained with denoising to learn to
produce high-quality, general-purpose compressed representations by the
encoder. DeCAL applies small modifications to the encoder, with the emphasis on
maximizing compression quality, even at the expense of compute. We show that
DeCAL at 2x compression can match uncompressed on many downstream tasks, with
usually only minor dropoff in metrics up to 8x compression, among
question-answering, summarization, and multi-vector retrieval tasks. DeCAL
offers significant savings where pre-computed dense representations can be
utilized, and we believe the approach can be further developed to be more
broadly applicable.

Motivation: 抑郁症预测缺乏大规模高质量数据集，阻碍了应用。

Method: 训练DepressLLM于3699篇自传体叙述，结合SToPS模块提供可解释预测。

Result: AUC为0.789，高置信度样本达0.904；验证了在异质数据上的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 可解释AI有助于早期抑郁症诊断，展示了医学AI在精神科的潜力。

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of
applications. However, depression prediction is hindered by the lack of
large-scale, high-quality, and rigorously annotated datasets. This study
introduces DepressLLM, trained and evaluated on a novel corpus of 3,699
autobiographical narratives reflecting both happiness and distress. DepressLLM
provides interpretable depression predictions and, via its Score-guided Token
Probability Summation (SToPS) module, delivers both improved classification
performance and reliable confidence estimates, achieving an AUC of 0.789, which
rises to 0.904 on samples with confidence $\geq$ 0.95. To validate its
robustness to heterogeneous data, we evaluated DepressLLM on in-house datasets,
including an Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) corpus of daily stress and
mood recordings, and on public clinical interview data. Finally, a psychiatric
review of high-confidence misclassifications highlighted key model and data
limitations that suggest directions for future refinements. These findings
demonstrate that interpretable AI can enable earlier diagnosis of depression
and underscore the promise of medical AI in psychiatry.

Motivation: RAG系统在处理粤语等方言时面临数据稀缺和语言变异性问题，需通过PEFT方法提升其检索和生成能力。

Method: 评估了LoRA在RAG框架中的集成，对比了不同PEFT方法，并分析了动态适应、合成数据生成等策略的效果。

Result: 动态和集成LoRA方法显著减少了可训练参数，同时保持了检索和生成质量，但在方言细节保留上仍有不足。

Conclusion: PEFT增强的RAG系统在领域特定任务中具有潜力，未来需关注方言真实性、动态适应和可扩展性。

Abstract: This review examines recent advances in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT), with a focus on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to optimize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems like Qwen3, DeepSeek, and Kimi.
These systems face challenges in understanding and generating authentic
Cantonese colloquial expressions due to limited annotated data and linguistic
variability. The review evaluates the integration of LoRA within RAG
frameworks, benchmarks PEFT methods for retrieval and generation accuracy,
identify domain adaptation strategies under limited data, and compares
fine-tuning techniques aimed at improving semantic fidelity under data-scarce
conditions. A systematic analysis of recent studies employing diverse LoRA
variants, synthetic data generation, user feedback integration, and adaptive
parameter allocation was conducted to assess their impact on computational
efficiency, retrieval precision, linguistic authenticity, and scalability.
Findings reveal that dynamic and ensemble LoRA adaptations significantly reduce
trainable parameters without sacrificing retrieval accuracy and generation
quality in dialectal contexts. However, limitations remain in fully preserving
fine-grained linguistic nuances, especially for low-resource settings like
Cantonese. The integration of real-time user feedback and domain-specific data
remains underdeveloped, limiting model adaptability and personalization. While
selective parameter freezing and nonlinear adaptation methods offer better
trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy, their robustness at scale remains
an open challenge. This review highlights the promise of PEFT-enhanced RAG
systems for domain-specific language tasks and calls for future work targeting
dialectal authenticity, dynamic adaptation, and scalable fine-tuning pipelines.

Conclusion: 任务规模扩展（task scaling）是提升推理能力的有效途径，InternBootcamp为通用推理模型的发展提供了基础设施。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence by
enabling complex reasoning capabilities. While recent advancements in
reinforcement learning (RL) have primarily focused on domain-specific reasoning
tasks (e.g., mathematics or code generation), real-world reasoning scenarios
often require models to handle diverse and complex environments that
narrow-domain benchmarks cannot fully capture. To address this gap, we present
InternBootcamp, an open-source framework comprising 1000+ domain-diverse task
environments specifically designed for LLM reasoning research. Our codebase
offers two key functionalities: (1) automated generation of unlimited
training/testing cases with configurable difficulty levels, and (2) integrated
verification modules for objective response evaluation. These features make
InternBootcamp fundamental infrastructure for RL-based model optimization,
synthetic data generation, and model evaluation. Although manually developing
such a framework with enormous task coverage is extremely cumbersome, we
accelerate the development procedure through an automated agent workflow
supplemented by manual validation protocols, which enables the task scope to
expand rapidly. % With these bootcamps, we further establish Bootcamp-EVAL, an
automatically generated benchmark for comprehensive performance assessment.
Evaluation reveals that frontier models still underperform in many reasoning
tasks, while training with InternBootcamp provides an effective way to
significantly improve performance, leading to our 32B model that achieves
state-of-the-art results on Bootcamp-EVAL and excels on other established
benchmarks. In particular, we validate that consistent performance gains come
from including more training tasks, namely \textbf{task scaling}, over two
orders of magnitude, offering a promising route towards capable reasoning
generalist.

Abstract: As multimodal large language models advance rapidly, the automation of mobile
tasks has become increasingly feasible through the use of mobile-use agents
that mimic human interactions from graphical user interface. To further enhance
mobile-use agents, previous studies employ demonstration learning to improve
mobile-use agents from human demonstrations. However, these methods focus
solely on the explicit intention flows of humans (e.g., step sequences) while
neglecting implicit intention flows (e.g., personal preferences), which makes
it difficult to construct personalized mobile-use agents. In this work, to
evaluate the \textbf{I}ntention \textbf{A}lignment \textbf{R}ate between
mobile-use agents and humans, we first collect \textbf{MobileIAR}, a dataset
containing human-intent-aligned actions and ground-truth actions. This enables
a comprehensive assessment of the agents' understanding of human intent. Then
we propose \textbf{IFRAgent}, a framework built upon \textbf{I}ntention
\textbf{F}low \textbf{R}ecognition from human demonstrations. IFRAgent analyzes
explicit intention flows from human demonstrations to construct a query-level
vector library of standard operating procedures (SOP), and analyzes implicit
intention flows to build a user-level habit repository. IFRAgent then leverages
a SOP extractor combined with retrieval-augmented generation and a query
rewriter to generate personalized query and SOP from a raw ambiguous query,
enhancing the alignment between mobile-use agents and human intent.
Experimental results demonstrate that IFRAgent outperforms baselines by an
average of 6.79\% (32.06\% relative improvement) in human intention alignment
rate and improves step completion rates by an average of 5.30\% (26.34\%
relative improvement). The codes are available at

However, all models struggle in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios compared to

Abstract: Transforming unstructured text into structured data is a complex task,
requiring semantic understanding, reasoning, and structural comprehension.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential, they often struggle with
handling ambiguous or domain-specific data, maintaining table structure,
managing long inputs, and addressing numerical reasoning. This paper proposes
an efficient system for LLM-driven text-to-table generation that leverages
novel prompting techniques. Specifically, the system incorporates two key
strategies: breaking down the text-to-table task into manageable, guided
sub-tasks and refining the generated tables through iterative self-feedback. We
show that this custom task decomposition allows the model to address the
problem in a stepwise manner and improves the quality of the generated table.
Furthermore, we discuss the benefits and potential risks associated with
iterative self-feedback on the generated tables while highlighting the
trade-offs between enhanced performance and computational cost. Our methods
achieve strong results compared to baselines on two complex text-to-table
generation datasets available in the public domain.

Result: TopXGen显著提升了LLM在低资源语言翻译中的性能。

Conclusion: TopXGen为低资源语言翻译提供了一种有效的数据生成方法。

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to perform well in machine translation (MT) with the use
of in-context learning (ICL), rivaling supervised models when translating into
high-resource languages (HRLs). However, they lag behind when translating into
low-resource language (LRLs). Example selection via similarity search and
supervised fine-tuning help. However the improvements they give are limited by
the size, quality and diversity of existing parallel datasets. A common
technique in low-resource MT is synthetic parallel data creation, the most
frequent of which is backtranslation, whereby existing target-side texts are
automatically translated into the source language. However, this assumes the
existence of good quality and relevant target-side texts, which are not readily
available for many LRLs. In this paper, we present \textsc{TopXGen}, an
LLM-based approach for the generation of high quality and topic-diverse data in
multiple LRLs, which can then be backtranslated to produce useful and diverse
parallel texts for ICL and fine-tuning. Our intuition is that while LLMs
struggle to translate into LRLs, their ability to translate well into HRLs and
their multilinguality enable them to generate good quality, natural-sounding
target-side texts, which can be translated well into a high-resource source
language. We show that \textsc{TopXGen} boosts LLM translation performance
during fine-tuning and in-context learning. Code and outputs are available at

Abstract: Voice-controlled interfaces can support older adults in clinical contexts,
with chatbots being a prime example, but reliable Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR) for underrepresented groups remains a bottleneck. This study evaluates
state-of-the-art ASR models on language use of older Dutch adults, who
interacted with the Welzijn.AI chatbot designed for geriatric contexts. We
benchmark generic multilingual ASR models, and models fine-tuned for Dutch
spoken by older adults, while also considering processing speed. Our results
show that generic multilingual models outperform fine-tuned models, which
suggests recent ASR models can generalise well out of the box to realistic
datasets. Furthermore, our results suggest that truncating existing
architectures is helpful in balancing the accuracy-speed trade-off, though we
also identify some cases with high WER due to hallucinations.

Abstract: As text generation has become a core capability of modern Large Language
Models (LLMs), it underpins a wide range of downstream applications. However,
most existing LLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) generation, producing one token
at a time based on previously generated context-resulting in limited generation
speed due to the inherently sequential nature of the process. To address this
challenge, an increasing number of researchers have begun exploring parallel
text generation-a broad class of techniques aimed at breaking the
token-by-token generation bottleneck and improving inference efficiency.
Despite growing interest, there remains a lack of comprehensive analysis on
what specific techniques constitute parallel text generation and how they
improve inference performance. To bridge this gap, we present a systematic
survey of parallel text generation methods. We categorize existing approaches
into AR-based and Non-AR-based paradigms, and provide a detailed examination of
the core techniques within each category. Following this taxonomy, we assess
their theoretical trade-offs in terms of speed, quality, and efficiency, and
examine their potential for combination and comparison with alternative
acceleration strategies. Finally, based on our findings, we highlight recent
advancements, identify open challenges, and outline promising directions for
future research in parallel text generation.

Result: 实验表明，IROTE生成的自我反思能在多样任务中稳定诱导LLMs模仿目标特质，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: IROTE通过自我反思优化，实现了LLMs对目标特质的稳定和可转移激发。

Abstract: Trained on various human-authored corpora, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated a certain capability of reflecting specific human-like traits
(e.g., personality or values) by prompting, benefiting applications like
personalized LLMs and social simulations. However, existing methods suffer from
the superficial elicitation problem: LLMs can only be steered to mimic shallow
and unstable stylistic patterns, failing to embody the desired traits precisely
and consistently across diverse tasks like humans. To address this challenge,
we propose IROTE, a novel in-context method for stable and transferable trait
elicitation. Drawing on psychological theories suggesting that traits are
formed through identity-related reflection, our method automatically generates
and optimizes a textual self-reflection within prompts, which comprises
self-perceived experience, to stimulate LLMs' trait-driven behavior. The
optimization is performed by iteratively maximizing an information-theoretic
objective that enhances the connections between LLMs' behavior and the target
trait, while reducing noisy redundancy in reflection without any fine-tuning,
leading to evocative and compact trait reflection. Extensive experiments across
three human trait systems manifest that one single IROTE-generated
self-reflection can induce LLMs' stable impersonation of the target trait
across diverse downstream tasks beyond simple questionnaire answering,
consistently outperforming existing strong baselines.

Motivation: 现有LoRA方法在多源异构MLLG数据中表现不佳，无法满足语义保真和多样通俗风格生成的需求。

Method: 提出Magical架构，采用共享矩阵A和多隔离矩阵B，引入语义不变约束和推荐引导切换机制。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，Magical优于现有方法，并减少31.66%的可训练参数。

Conclusion: Magical为异构数据下的MLLG任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Medical Lay Language Generation (MLLG) plays a vital role in improving the
accessibility of complex scientific content for broader audiences. Recent
literature to MLLG commonly employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such
as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using
paired expert-lay language datasets. However, LoRA struggles with the
challenges posed by multi-source heterogeneous MLLG datasets. Specifically,
through a series of exploratory experiments, we reveal that standard LoRA fail
to meet the requirement for semantic fidelity and diverse lay-style generation
in MLLG task. To address these limitations, we propose Magical, an asymmetric
LoRA architecture tailored for MLLG under heterogeneous data scenarios. Magical
employs a shared matrix $A$ for abstractive summarization, along with multiple
isolated matrices $B$ for diverse lay-style generation. To preserve semantic
fidelity during the lay language generation process, Magical introduces a
Semantic Invariance Constraint to mitigate semantic subspace shifts on matrix
$A$. Furthermore, to better adapt to diverse lay-style generation, Magical
incorporates the Recommendation-guided Switch, an externally interface to
prompt the LLM to switch between different matrices $B$. Experimental results
on three real-world lay language generation datasets demonstrate that Magical
consistently outperforms prompt-based methods, vanilla LoRA, and its recent
variants, while also reducing trainable parameters by 31.66%.

Conclusion: SciRerankBench是首个专门评估RAG-LLMs中重排序器的基准，为未来研究提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Scientific literature question answering is a pivotal step towards new
scientific discoveries. Recently, \textit{two-stage} retrieval-augmented
generated large language models (RAG-LLMs) have shown impressive advancements
in this domain. Such a two-stage framework, especially the second stage
(reranker), is particularly essential in the scientific domain, where subtle
differences in terminology may have a greatly negative impact on the final
factual-oriented or knowledge-intensive answers. Despite this significant
progress, the potential and limitations of these works remain unexplored. In
this work, we present a Scientific Rerank-oriented RAG Benchmark
(SciRerankBench), for evaluating rerankers within RAG-LLMs systems, spanning
five scientific subjects. To rigorously assess the reranker performance in
terms of noise resilience, relevance disambiguation, and factual consistency,
we develop three types of question-context-answer (Q-C-A) pairs, i.e., Noisy
Contexts (NC), Semantically Similar but Logically Irrelevant Contexts (SSLI),
and Counterfactual Contexts (CC). Through systematic evaluation of 13 widely
used rerankers on five families of LLMs, we provide detailed insights into
their relative strengths and limitations. To the best of our knowledge,
SciRerankBench is the first benchmark specifically developed to evaluate
rerankers within RAG-LLMs, which provides valuable observations and guidance
for their future development.

Abstract: The manual translation of unstructured team dialogue into the structured
artifacts required for Information Technology (IT) project governance is a
critical bottleneck in modern information systems management. We introduce
DevNous, a Large Language Model-based (LLM) multi-agent expert system, to
automate this unstructured-to-structured translation process. DevNous
integrates directly into team chat environments, identifying actionable intents
from informal dialogue and managing stateful, multi-turn workflows for core
administrative tasks like automated task formalization and progress summary
synthesis. To quantitatively evaluate the system, we introduce a new benchmark
of 160 realistic, interactive conversational turns. The dataset was manually
annotated with a multi-label ground truth and is publicly available. On this
benchmark, DevNous achieves an exact match turn accuracy of 81.3\% and a
multiset F1-Score of 0.845, providing strong evidence for its viability. The
primary contributions of this work are twofold: (1) a validated architectural
pattern for developing ambient administrative agents, and (2) the introduction
of the first robust empirical baseline and public benchmark dataset for this
challenging problem domain.

Motivation: LLMs存在幻觉和知识过时问题，RAG通过整合外部知识（如KGs）解决这些问题，但私有KGs的使用带来隐私风险。

Method: 提出ARoG框架，包含关系中心抽象和结构导向抽象策略，将匿名实体转换为可检索信息，并优化问题与匿名实体的匹配。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，ARoG在性能和隐私鲁棒性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: ARoG有效解决了隐私保护RAG场景中的关键挑战，同时提升了检索性能。

Abstract: LLMs often suffer from hallucinations and outdated or incomplete knowledge.
RAG is proposed to address these issues by integrating external knowledge like
that in KGs into LLMs. However, leveraging private KGs in RAG systems poses
significant privacy risks due to the black-box nature of LLMs and potential
insecure data transmission, especially when using third-party LLM APIs lacking
transparency and control. In this paper, we investigate the privacy-protected
RAG scenario for the first time, where entities in KGs are anonymous for LLMs,
thus preventing them from accessing entity semantics. Due to the loss of
semantics of entities, previous RAG systems cannot retrieve question-relevant
knowledge from KGs by matching questions with the meaningless identifiers of
anonymous entities. To realize an effective RAG system in this scenario, two
key challenges must be addressed: (1) How can anonymous entities be converted
into retrievable information. (2) How to retrieve question-relevant anonymous
entities. Hence, we propose a novel ARoG framework including relation-centric
abstraction and structure-oriented abstraction strategies. For challenge (1),
the first strategy abstracts entities into high-level concepts by dynamically
capturing the semantics of their adjacent relations. It supplements meaningful
semantics which can further support the retrieval process. For challenge (2),
the second strategy transforms unstructured natural language questions into
structured abstract concept paths. These paths can be more effectively aligned
with the abstracted concepts in KGs, thereby improving retrieval performance.
To guide LLMs to effectively retrieve knowledge from KGs, the two strategies
strictly protect privacy from being exposed to LLMs. Experiments on three
datasets demonstrate that ARoG achieves strong performance and
privacy-robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏专门为工具使用设计的高效强化学习框架，限制了大型语言模型在工具使用方面的进展。

Method: 开发了自动化环境构建管道（包括场景分解、文档生成、函数集成、复杂性扩展和本地化部署）和可验证奖励机制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了模型的工具使用性能，且不影响其通用能力。

Conclusion: 改进源于对上下文理解和推理的提升，尤其是模型底层MLP参数的更新。

Abstract: Effective tool use is essential for large language models (LLMs) to interact
meaningfully with their environment. However, progress is limited by the lack
of efficient reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks specifically designed for
tool use, due to challenges in constructing stable training environments and
designing verifiable reward mechanisms. To address this, we propose an
automated environment construction pipeline, incorporating scenario
decomposition, document generation, function integration, complexity scaling,
and localized deployment. This enables the creation of high-quality training
environments that provide detailed and measurable feedback without relying on
external tools. Additionally, we introduce a verifiable reward mechanism that
evaluates both the precision of tool use and the completeness of task
execution. When combined with trajectory data collected from the constructed
environments, this mechanism integrates seamlessly with standard RL algorithms
to facilitate feedback-driven model training. Experiments on LLMs of varying
scales demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the models'
tool-use performance without degrading their general capabilities, regardless
of inference modes or training algorithms. Our analysis suggests that these
gains result from improved context understanding and reasoning, driven by
updates to the lower-layer MLP parameters in models.

TL;DR: 论文提出TiMoE方法，通过时间分段的预训练和因果路由解决大语言模型（LLMs）知识过时和预测时间泄漏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型通常基于固定时间点的网络数据进行训练，导致知识过时且预测可能依赖未来信息。

Method: 预训练一组GPT风格的专家模型，每个模型针对2013-2024年数据的不同两年片段，并通过TiMoE（时间感知的混合专家）结合。推理时屏蔽训练窗口晚于查询时间戳的专家模型。

Result: TiMoE在八个标准NLP任务和TSQA基准测试中表现优异，减少未来知识错误达15%。

Conclusion: 模块化、时间分段的预训练结合因果路由是一种简单有效的方法，可保持LLMs的时间准确性而不显著牺牲性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on fixed snapshots of the
web, which means that their knowledge becomes stale and their predictions risk
temporal leakage: relying on information that lies in the future relative to a
query. We tackle this problem by pre-training from scratch a set of GPT-style
experts on disjoint two-year slices of a 2013-2024 corpus and combining them
through TiMoE, a Time-aware Mixture of Language Experts. At inference time,
TiMoE masks all experts whose training window ends after the query timestamp
and merges the remaining log-probabilities in a shared space, guaranteeing
strict causal validity while retaining the breadth of multi-period knowledge.
We also release TSQA, a 10k-question benchmark whose alternatives are
explicitly labelled as past, future or irrelevant, allowing fine-grained
measurement of temporal hallucinations. Experiments on eight standard NLP tasks
plus TSQA show that a co-adapted TiMoE variant matches or exceeds the best
single-period expert and cuts future-knowledge errors by up to 15%. Our results
demonstrate that modular, time-segmented pre-training paired with causal
routing is a simple yet effective path toward LLMs that stay chronologically
grounded without sacrificing general performance much. We open source our code
at TiMoE (Github): https://github.com/epfml/TiMoE

Motivation: 传统方法难以全面评估LLMs的数学推理能力，因此需要一种新方法来测试其对非数学扰动的敏感性。

Method: 通过数学等价但语言和参数变化的问题，构建PutnamGAP数据集，并评估多种LLMs的鲁棒性。

Result: 18个商业和开源模型在变体问题上表现显著下降，如OpenAI的O3模型在核心步骤变体上下降了10.5个百分点。

Conclusion: 新评估方法有效揭示了LLMs的鲁棒性不足，为提升其数学推理能力提供了新方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a systematic framework beyond conventional method
to assess LLMs' mathematical-reasoning robustness by stress-testing them on
advanced math problems that are mathematically equivalent but with linguistic
and parametric variation. These transformations allow us to measure the
sensitivity of LLMs to non-mathematical perturbations, thereby enabling a more
accurate evaluation of their mathematical reasoning capabilities. Using this
new evaluation methodology, we created PutnamGAP, a new benchmark dataset with
multiple mathematically-equivalent variations of competition-level math
problems. With the new dataset, we evaluate multiple families of representative
LLMs and examine their robustness. Across 18 commercial and open-source models
we observe sharp performance degradation on the variants. OpenAI's flagship
reasoning model, O3, scores 49 % on the originals but drops by 4 percentage
points on surface variants, and by 10.5 percentage points on core-step-based
variants, while smaller models fare far worse. Overall, the results show that
the proposed new evaluation methodology is effective for deepening our
understanding of the robustness of LLMs and generating new insights for further
improving their mathematical reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在广泛应用中表现出色，但其编码和再现意识形态偏见的问题仍然存在，尤其是在政治和经济维度上。

Method: 基于政治罗盘测试（PCT），通过对比对提取和比较模型（如Mistral和DeepSeek）的隐藏层激活，引入了一个全面的激活提取流程。

Result: 研究发现解码器型LLM在层级间系统地编码了表征偏见，并可通过导向向量有效减轻这些偏见。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了LLM中政治偏见的编码方式，并提供了一种超越表层干预的去偏见方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their
widespread use across diverse real-world applications. However, concerns remain
about their tendency to encode and reproduce ideological biases, particularly
along political and economic dimensions. In this paper, we propose a framework
for probing and mitigating such biases in decoder-based LLMs through analysis
of internal model representations. Grounded in the Political Compass Test
(PCT), our method uses contrastive pairs to extract and compare hidden layer
activations from models like Mistral and DeepSeek. We introduce a comprehensive
activation extraction pipeline capable of layer-wise analysis across multiple
ideological axes, revealing meaningful disparities linked to political framing.
Our results show that decoder LLMs systematically encode representational bias
across layers, which can be leveraged for effective steering vector-based
mitigation. This work provides new insights into how political bias is encoded
in LLMs and offers a principled approach to debiasing beyond surface-level
output interventions.

Abstract: Understanding biases and stereotypes encoded in the weights of Large Language
Models (LLMs) is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. Biased
behaviour is often subtle and non-trivial to isolate, even when deliberately
elicited, making systematic analysis and debiasing particularly challenging. To
address this, we introduce BiasGym, a simple, cost-effective, and generalizable
framework for reliably injecting, analyzing, and mitigating conceptual
associations within LLMs. BiasGym consists of two components: BiasInject, which
injects specific biases into the model via token-based fine-tuning while
keeping the model frozen, and BiasScope, which leverages these injected signals
to identify and steer the components responsible for biased behavior. Our
method enables consistent bias elicitation for mechanistic analysis, supports
targeted debiasing without degrading performance on downstream tasks, and
generalizes to biases unseen during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of BiasGym in reducing real-world stereotypes (e.g., people from a country
being `reckless drivers') and in probing fictional associations (e.g., people
from a country having `blue skin'), showing its utility for both safety
interventions and interpretability research.

Motivation: 减少资深医生在放射学报告质量评估中的劳动成本，并解决人工评分可能存在的偏差问题。

Method: 采用Span级别的语义差异分析，通过测量修订文本的重要性来生成质量评分。

Result: 在12,013份放射学报告上的实验表明，Sqator能生成与资深医生判断一致的评分。

Conclusion: Sqator是一种有效的自动评分工具，能够替代人工评分并减少偏差。

Abstract: Quality Assurance (QA) for radiology reports refers to judging whether the
junior reports (written by junior doctors) are qualified. The QA scores of one
junior report are given by the senior doctor(s) after reviewing the image and
junior report. This process requires intensive labor costs for senior doctors.
Additionally, the QA scores may be inaccurate for reasons like diagnosis bias,
the ability of senior doctors, and so on. To address this issue, we propose a
Span-level Quality Assurance EvaluaTOR (Sqator) to mark QA scores
automatically. Unlike the common document-level semantic comparison method, we
try to analyze the semantic difference by exploring more fine-grained text
spans. Unlike the common document-level semantic comparison method, we try to
analyze the semantic difference by exploring more fine-grained text spans.
Specifically, Sqator measures QA scores by measuring the importance of revised
spans between junior and senior reports, and outputs the final QA scores by
merging all revised span scores. We evaluate Sqator using a collection of
12,013 radiology reports. Experimental results show that Sqator can achieve
competitive QA scores. Moreover, the importance scores of revised spans can be
also consistent with the judgments of senior doctors.

Conclusion: 为未来减轻文化偏见、提升LLMs文化理解奠定基础，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: The growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) across diverse
cultural contexts necessitates a better understanding of how the
overgeneralization of less documented cultures within LLMs' representations
impacts their cultural understanding. Prior work only performs extrinsic
evaluation of LLMs' cultural competence, without accounting for how LLMs'
internal mechanisms lead to cultural (mis)representation. To bridge this gap,
we propose Culturescope, the first mechanistic interpretability-based method
that probes the internal representations of LLMs to elicit the underlying
cultural knowledge space. CultureScope utilizes a patching method to extract
the cultural knowledge. We introduce a cultural flattening score as a measure
of the intrinsic cultural biases. Additionally, we study how LLMs internalize
Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening, which allows us to trace how
cultural biases emerge within LLMs. Our experimental results reveal that LLMs
encode Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening in their cultural
knowledge space. We find that low-resource cultures are less susceptible to
cultural biases, likely due to their limited training resources. Our work
provides a foundation for future research on mitigating cultural biases and
enhancing LLMs' cultural understanding. Our codes and data used for experiments
are publicly available.

Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of large language models (LLMs) pose
significant inference latency challenges, primarily due to their autoregressive
decoding paradigm characterized by the sequential nature of next-token
prediction. By re-examining the outputs of autoregressive models, we observed
that some segments exhibit parallelizable structures, which we term intrinsic
parallelism. Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel
decoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In
this paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which
addresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data
and efficient parallel decoding mechanism. More specifically, we introduce a
non-invasive pipeline that automatically extracts and validates parallelizable
structures from the responses of autoregressive models. To empower efficient
adaptive serial-parallel decoding, we implement a Hybrid Decoding Engine which
enables seamless transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while
maintaining a reusable KV cache, maximizing computational efficiency. Extensive
evaluations across General Tasks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Mathematical
Reasoning, demonstrate that ASPD achieves unprecedented performance in both
effectiveness and efficiency. Notably, on Vicuna Bench, our method achieves up
to 3.19x speedup (1.85x on average) while maintaining response quality within
1% difference compared to autoregressive models, realizing significant
acceleration without compromising generation quality. Our framework sets a
groundbreaking benchmark for efficient LLM parallel inference, paving the way
for its deployment in latency-sensitive applications such as AI-powered
customer service bots and answer retrieval engines.

### [45] [Munsit at NADI 2025 Shared Task 2: Pushing the Boundaries of Multidialectal Arabic ASR with Weakly Supervised Pretraining and Continual Supervised Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08912)
*Mahmoud Salhab,Shameed Sait,Mohammad Abusheikh,Hasan Abusheikh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合弱监督学习和监督微调的可扩展训练流程，用于开发鲁棒的阿拉伯语自动语音识别（ASR）模型，解决了低资源语言的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语等低资源语言由于标注数据有限和方言多样性，开发准确的ASR系统具有挑战性。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：首先在15,000小时的弱标注语音上预训练模型，然后结合过滤后的弱标注数据和小规模高质量标注数据进行监督微调。

Result: 在多方言阿拉伯语ASR挑战中取得最佳成绩，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 弱监督与微调结合能有效克服数据稀缺问题，为低资源、多方言语言提供高质量的ASR。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) plays a vital role in enabling natural
human-machine interaction across applications such as virtual assistants,
industrial automation, customer support, and real-time transcription. However,
developing accurate ASR systems for low-resource languages like Arabic remains
a significant challenge due to limited labeled data and the linguistic
complexity introduced by diverse dialects. In this work, we present a scalable
training pipeline that combines weakly supervised learning with supervised
fine-tuning to develop a robust Arabic ASR model. In the first stage, we
pretrain the model on 15,000 hours of weakly labeled speech covering both
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various Dialectal Arabic (DA) variants. In the
subsequent stage, we perform continual supervised fine-tuning using a mixture
of filtered weakly labeled data and a small, high-quality annotated dataset.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, ranking first in the
multi-dialectal Arabic ASR challenge. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of weak supervision paired with fine-tuning in overcoming data
scarcity and delivering high-quality ASR for low-resource, dialect-rich
languages.

Motivation: 当前语言模型的评估主要集中在高资源语言（如英语），缺乏对低资源语言（如Bangla）的多步推理能力研究。

Method: 手动翻译英语Reveal数据集为Bangla版本，对比评估英语和Bangla多语言小语言模型的表现。

Result: 推理上下文对非二元问题有益，但模型难以有效利用Bangla推理步骤。

Conclusion: 不同模型和语言在利用推理步骤时表现出不同趋势，需进一步研究如何优化低资源语言的推理能力。

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex
multi-step reasoning tasks. However, their evaluation has been predominantly
confined to high-resource languages such as English. In this paper, we
introduce a manually translated Bangla multi-step reasoning dataset derived
from the English Reveal dataset, featuring both binary and non-binary question
types. We conduct a controlled evaluation of English-centric and Bangla-centric
multilingual small language models on the original dataset and our translated
version to compare their ability to exploit relevant reasoning steps to produce
correct answers. Our results show that, in comparable settings, reasoning
context is beneficial for more challenging non-binary questions, but models
struggle to employ relevant Bangla reasoning steps effectively. We conclude by
exploring how reasoning steps contribute to models' predictions, highlighting
different trends across models and languages.

Result: 在多个数据集上，该方法在相同最终预算下优于固定预算基线，准确率和令牌效率显著提高。

Abstract: Recent work on enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) has introduced explicit length control as a means of constraining
computational cost while preserving accuracy. However, existing approaches rely
on fixed-length training budgets, which do not take advantage of the natural
progression from exploration to compression during learning. In this work, we
propose a curriculum learning strategy for length-controlled reasoning using
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our method starts with generous
token budgets and gradually tightens them over training, encouraging models to
first discover effective solution strategies and then distill them into more
concise reasoning traces. We augment GRPO with a reward function that balances
three signals: task correctness (via verifier feedback), length efficiency, and
formatting adherence (via structural tags). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500,
SVAMP, College Math, and GSM+ demonstrate that curriculum-based training
consistently outperforms fixed-budget baselines at the same final budget,
achieving higher accuracy and significantly improved token efficiency. We
further ablate the impact of reward weighting and decay schedule design,
showing that progressive constraint serves as a powerful inductive bias for
training efficient reasoning models. Our code and checkpoints are released at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs的幻觉问题，提升其生成答案的忠实性和信任度。

Method: LoDIT通过两步实现：标记文档并利用特定标记逻辑估计文档贡献，再聚合这些贡献为归因。

Result: 在Trust-Align基准测试中，LoDIT显著优于现有方法，并在延迟和鲁棒性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: LoDIT在提升生成答案的忠实性和效率方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performances, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain
prone to hallucination, which critically undermines their trustworthiness.
While most of the previous work focused on tackling answer and attribution
correctness, a recent line of work investigated faithfulness, with a focus on
leveraging internal model signals to reflect a model's actual decision-making
process while generating the answer. Nevertheless, these methods induce
additional latency and have shown limitations in directly aligning token
generation with attribution generation. In this paper, we introduce LoDIT, a
method that jointly generates and faithfully attributes answers in RAG by
leveraging specific token logits during generation. It consists of two steps:
(1) marking the documents with specific token identifiers and then leveraging
the logits of these tokens to estimate the contribution of each document to the
answer during generation, and (2) aggregating these contributions into document
attributions. Experiments on a trustworthiness-focused attributed
text-generation benchmark, Trust-Align, show that LoDIT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art models on several metrics. Finally, an in-depth
analysis of LoDIT shows both its efficiency in terms of latency and its
robustness in different settings.

TL;DR: RetroAttention是一种新的KV缓存更新技术，通过修正累积的注意力错误，提升长上下文任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文任务中，KV缓存的内存占用和延迟问题限制了LLMs的性能，现有方法未能解决解码过程中的累积注意力错误。

Method: 提出RetroAttention技术，利用后续解码步骤的新KV条目修正过去的注意力输出，保持轻量级输出缓存。

Result: 实验表明，RetroAttention在长生成任务中优于现有方法，KV暴露提升1.6倍，准确率提升21.9%。

Conclusion: RetroAttention通过动态修正注意力输出，显著提升了长上下文任务的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in long-context tasks
such as reasoning, code generation, and multi-turn dialogue. However, inference
over extended contexts is bottlenecked by the Key-Value (KV) cache, whose
memory footprint grows linearly with sequence length and dominates latency at
each decoding step. While recent KV cache compression methods identify and load
important tokens, they focus predominantly on input contexts and fail to
address the cumulative attention errors that arise during long decoding. In
this paper, we introduce RetroAttention, a novel KV cache update technique that
retrospectively revises past attention outputs using newly arrived KV entries
from subsequent decoding steps. By maintaining a lightweight output cache,
RetroAttention enables past queries to efficiently access more relevant
context, while incurring minimal latency overhead. This breaks the
fixed-attention-output paradigm and allows continual correction of prior
approximations. Extensive experiments on long-generation benchmarks show that
RetroAttention consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) KV compression
methods, increasing effective KV exposure by up to 1.6$\times$ and accuracy by
up to 21.9\%.

Conclusion: 零样本代码生成是表格问答的有效方法，无需任务特定训练即可实现竞争力表现。

Abstract: This paper describes our participation in SemEval 2025 Task 8, focused on
Tabular Question Answering. We developed a zero-shot pipeline that leverages an
Large Language Model to generate functional code capable of extracting the
relevant information from tabular data based on an input question. Our approach
consists of a modular pipeline where the main code generator module is
supported by additional components that identify the most relevant columns and
analyze their data types to improve extraction accuracy. In the event that the
generated code fails, an iterative refinement process is triggered,
incorporating the error feedback into a new generation prompt to enhance
robustness. Our results show that zero-shot code generation is a valid approach
for Tabular QA, achieving rank 33 of 53 in the test phase despite the lack of
task-specific fine-tuning.

Result: 总结了TF对齐方法的优缺点，提出了未来研究方向，为开发更安全可靠的LLM提供了指导。

Conclusion: TF对齐方法是一种有前景的替代方案，未来需进一步研究以提升其包容性和有效性。

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) aims to ensure their outputs
adhere to human values, ethical standards, and legal norms. Traditional
alignment methods often rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning (FT), which may
suffer from knowledge degradation and face challenges in scenarios where the
model accessibility or computational resources are constrained. In contrast,
training-free (TF) alignment techniques--leveraging in-context learning,
decoding-time adjustments, and post-generation corrections--offer a promising
alternative by enabling alignment without heavily retraining LLMs, making them
adaptable to both open-source and closed-source environments. This paper
presents the first systematic review of TF alignment methods, categorizing them
by stages of pre-decoding, in-decoding, and post-decoding. For each stage, we
provide a detailed examination from the viewpoint of LLMs and multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs), highlighting their mechanisms and limitations. Furthermore, we
identify key challenges and future directions, paving the way for more
inclusive and effective TF alignment techniques. By synthesizing and organizing
the rapidly growing body of research, this survey offers a guidance for
practitioners and advances the development of safer and more reliable LLMs.

<details>

Motivation: 直接应用LLMs于患者治疗场景存在伦理和安全问题，因此转向开发LLM作为监督者来训练治疗师。

Result: 实验表明，基于MATE数据集微调的模型能根据临床指南提供高质量反馈。

Conclusion: 该方法在治疗师培训场景中展现出显著潜力。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) hold significant promise in
psychotherapy, their direct application in patient-facing scenarios raises
ethical and safety concerns. Therefore, this work shifts towards developing an
LLM as a supervisor to train real therapists. In addition to the privacy of
clinical therapist training data, a fundamental contradiction complicates the
training of therapeutic behaviors: clear feedback standards are necessary to
ensure a controlled training system, yet there is no absolute "gold standard"
for appropriate therapeutic behaviors in practice. In contrast, many common
therapeutic mistakes are universal and identifiable, making them effective
triggers for targeted feedback that can serve as clearer evidence. Motivated by
this, we create a novel therapist-training paradigm: (1) guidelines for
mistaken behaviors and targeted correction strategies are first established as
standards; (2) a human-in-the-loop dialogue-feedback dataset is then
constructed, where a mistake-prone agent intentionally makes standard mistakes
during interviews naturally, and a supervisor agent locates and identifies
mistakes and provides targeted feedback; (3) after fine-tuning on this dataset,
the final supervisor model is provided for real therapist training. The
detailed experimental results of automated, human and downstream assessments
demonstrate that models fine-tuned on our dataset MATE, can provide
high-quality feedback according to the clinical guideline, showing significant
potential for the therapist training scenario.

Abstract: Given the significant advances in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) in
reasoning and visual understanding, mobile agents are rapidly emerging to meet
users' automation needs. However, existing evaluation benchmarks are
disconnected from the real world and fail to adequately address the diverse and
complex requirements of users. From our extensive collection of user
questionnaire, we identified five tasks: Multi-App, Vague, Interactive,
Single-App, and Unethical Instructions. Around these tasks, we present
\textbf{MVISU-Bench}, a bilingual benchmark that includes 404 tasks across 137
mobile applications. Furthermore, we propose Aider, a plug-and-play module that
acts as a dynamic prompt prompter to mitigate risks and clarify user intent for
mobile agents. Our Aider is easy to integrate into several frameworks and has
successfully improved overall success rates by 19.55\% compared to the current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVISU-Bench. Specifically, it achieves success rate
improvements of 53.52\% and 29.41\% for unethical and interactive instructions,
respectively. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we highlight the gap
between existing mobile agents and real-world user expectations.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的推理过程因其自回归性质难以加速，影响高效部署。现有方法多依赖额外训练，而READER旨在通过创新方法解决这一问题。

Result: READER在性能上超越现有方法，速度提升超过40%，在检索增强生成等任务中实现10倍以上加速。

Conclusion: READER为LLM推理提供了一种高效、无损的加速方案，特别适合工业应用中的大批量任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate tokens autoregressively, with each
token depending on the preceding context. This sequential nature makes the
inference process inherently difficult to accelerate, posing a significant
challenge for efficient deployment. In recent years, various methods have been
proposed to address this issue, with the most effective approaches often
involving the training of additional draft models. In this paper, we introduce
READER (Retrieval-Assisted Drafter for Efficient LLM Inference), a novel
lossless speculative decoding method that enhances model-based approaches by
leveraging self-repetitions in the text. Our algorithm expands the speculative
decoding tree using tokens obtained through statistical search. This work
focuses on large batch sizes (>= 8), an underexplored yet important area for
industrial applications. We also analyze the key-value (KV) cache size during
speculative decoding and propose an optimization to improve performance for
large batches. As a result, READER outperforms existing speculative decoding
methods. Notably, READER requires no additional training and can reuse
pre-trained speculator models, increasing the speedup by over 40\%. Our method
demonstrates particularly strong performance on search-based tasks, such as
retrieval-augmented generation, where we achieve more than 10x speedup.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励建模方法在主观任务中面临主观评价标准和不稳定奖励信号的挑战，而人类评价结合了显式标准和隐式比较判断。

Method: CPO将奖励评估从样本级评分转向组级比较评分，并引入CharacterArena框架，包括多轮角色扮演模拟和轨迹级比较评估。

Result: 在CharacterEval、CharacterBench和CharacterArena上的实验表明，CPO有效减少奖励模糊性，显著提升对话质量。

Conclusion: CPO和CharacterArena通过比较评估优化主观任务中的强化学习微调，提供更稳健和公平的性能评估。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) has achieved notable success in
tasks with objectively verifiable answers (e.g., code generation, mathematical
reasoning), yet struggles with open-ended subjective tasks like role-playing
dialogue. Traditional reward modeling approaches, which rely on independent
sample-wise scoring, face dual challenges: subjective evaluation criteria and
unstable reward signals.Motivated by the insight that human evaluation
inherently combines explicit criteria with implicit comparative judgments, we
propose Comparative Policy Optimization (CPO). CPO redefines the reward
evaluation paradigm by shifting from sample-wise scoring to comparative
group-wise scoring.Building on the same principle, we introduce the
CharacterArena evaluation framework, which comprises two stages:(1)
Contextualized Multi-turn Role-playing Simulation, and (2) Trajectory-level
Comparative Evaluation. By operationalizing subjective scoring via objective
trajectory comparisons, CharacterArena minimizes contextual bias and enables
more robust and fair performance evaluation. Empirical results on
CharacterEval, CharacterBench, and CharacterArena confirm that CPO effectively
mitigates reward ambiguity and leads to substantial improvements in dialogue
quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种融合所有中间层的多语言LLM架构，通过全局和Transformer Softmax策略显著提升了低资源语言的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如LangBridge仅使用最终编码层，导致低资源语言性能不佳，需要更丰富的语言信息传递。

Method: 提出融合所有中间层的架构，包括全局Softmax和Transformer Softmax策略，无需多语言数据训练。

Result: 在XNLI等任务中显著提升低资源语言性能，如Sinhala分类准确率从71.66%提高到75.86%。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效、公平的多语言LLM提供了可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in English, but their performance degrades
significantly on low-resource languages (LRLs) due to English-centric training.
While methods like LangBridge align LLMs with multilingual encoders such as the
Massively Multilingual Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (mT5), they typically
use only the final encoder layer. We propose a novel architecture that fuses
all intermediate layers, enriching the linguistic information passed to the
LLM. Our approach features two strategies: (1) a Global Softmax weighting for
overall layer importance, and (2) a Transformer Softmax model that learns
token-specific weights. The fused representations are mapped into the LLM's
embedding space, enabling it to process multilingual inputs. The model is
trained only on English data, without using any parallel or multilingual data.
Evaluated on XNLI, IndicXNLI, Sinhala News Classification, and Amazon Reviews,
our Transformer Softmax model significantly outperforms the LangBridge
baseline. We observe strong performance gains in LRLs, improving Sinhala
classification accuracy from 71.66% to 75.86% and achieving clear improvements
across Indic languages such as Tamil, Bengali, and Malayalam. These specific
gains contribute to an overall boost in average XNLI accuracy from 70.36% to
71.50%. This approach offers a scalable, data-efficient path toward more
capable and equitable multilingual LLMs.

Motivation: 流程工业中的事件日志碎片化阻碍了知识的有效利用，需要一种方法将相关记录连接起来以提高数据质量和推荐效果。

Method: 将记录链接（RL）任务建模为跨文档共指消解（CDCR），并结合自然语言推理（NLI）和语义文本相似性（STS），同时适应流程工业的文本格式。

Result: 提出的RL模型在性能上优于NLI和STS基线方法，分别提高了28%和27%。

Conclusion: 通过领域适应和增强推理能力，CDCR模型可以有效地应用于流程工业，改善事件日志的数据质量和连接性。

Abstract: Knowledge management (KM) is vital in the process industry for optimizing
operations, ensuring safety, and enabling continuous improvement through
effective use of operational data and past insights. A key challenge in this
domain is the fragmented nature of event logs in shift books, where related
records, e.g., entries documenting issues related to equipment or processes and
the corresponding solutions, may remain disconnected. This fragmentation
hinders the recommendation of previous solutions to the users. To address this
problem, we investigate record linking (RL) as link prediction, commonly
studied in graph-based machine learning, by framing it as a cross-document
coreference resolution (CDCR) task enhanced with natural language inference
(NLI) and semantic text similarity (STS) by shifting it into the causal
inference (CI). We adapt CDCR, traditionally applied in the news domain, into
an RL model to operate at the passage level, similar to NLI and STS, while
accommodating the process industry's specific text formats, which contain
unstructured text and structured record attributes. Our RL model outperformed
the best versions of NLI- and STS-driven baselines by 28% (11.43 points) and
27% (11.21 points), respectively. Our work demonstrates how domain adaptation
of the state-of-the-art CDCR models, enhanced with reasoning capabilities, can
be effectively tailored to the process industry, improving data quality and
connectivity in shift logs.

Conclusion: AutoCodeBench系列为多语言代码生成研究提供重要资源，推动社区关注更具挑战性和实用性的任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, with code generation emerging as a key area of focus. While
numerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their code generation
abilities, these benchmarks face several critical limitations. First, they
often rely on manual annotations, which are time-consuming and difficult to
scale across different programming languages and problem complexities. Second,
most existing benchmarks focus primarily on Python, while the few multilingual
benchmarks suffer from limited difficulty and uneven language distribution. To
address these challenges, we propose AutoCodeGen, an automated method for
generating high-difficulty multilingual code generation datasets without manual
annotations. AutoCodeGen ensures the correctness and completeness of test cases
by generating test inputs with LLMs and obtaining test outputs through a
multilingual sandbox, while achieving high data quality through reverse-order
problem generation and multiple filtering steps. Using this novel method, we
introduce AutoCodeBench, a large-scale code generation benchmark comprising
3,920 problems evenly distributed across 20 programming languages. It is
specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on challenging, diverse, and practical
multilingual tasks. We evaluate over 30 leading open-source and proprietary
LLMs on AutoCodeBench and its simplified version AutoCodeBench-Lite. The
results show that even the most advanced LLMs struggle with the complexity,
diversity, and multilingual nature of these tasks. Besides, we introduce
AutoCodeBench-Complete, specifically designed for base models to assess their
few-shot code generation capabilities. We hope the AutoCodeBench series will
serve as a valuable resource and inspire the community to focus on more
challenging and practical multilingual code generation scenarios.

Result: SinLlama在三个文本分类任务中显著优于Llama-3-8B及其指令变体。

Conclusion: SinLlama是首个支持Sinhala的开源解码器模型，为低资源语言提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Low-resource languages such as Sinhala are often overlooked by open-source
Large Language Models (LLMs). In this research, we extend an existing
multilingual LLM (Llama-3-8B) to better serve Sinhala. We enhance the LLM
tokenizer with Sinhala specific vocabulary and perform continual pre-training
on a cleaned 10 million Sinhala corpus, resulting in the SinLlama model. This
is the very first decoder-based open-source LLM with explicit Sinhala support.
When SinLlama was instruction fine-tuned for three text classification tasks,
it outperformed base and instruct variants of Llama-3-8B by a significant
margin.

TL;DR: OdysseyBench是一个用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）代理在长期工作流程中表现的综合性基准，填补了现有基准在复杂场景中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注独立任务，无法捕捉现实场景中的长期依赖和多交互协调需求。

Method: 提出OdysseyBench，包含两个任务集（OdysseyBench+和OdysseyBench-Neo），并开发HomerAgents框架自动化生成复杂任务。

Result: OdysseyBench能有效挑战现有LLM代理，提供更准确的复杂场景评估。

Conclusion: OdysseyBench是推动LLM代理在现实生产力场景中发展的宝贵资源。

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly
deployed in real-world applications requiring complex, long-horizon workflows.
However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on atomic tasks that are
self-contained and independent, failing to capture the long-term contextual
dependencies and multi-interaction coordination required in realistic
scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce OdysseyBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on long-horizon workflows across diverse
office applications including Word, Excel, PDF, Email, and Calendar. Our
benchmark comprises two complementary splits: OdysseyBench+ with 300 tasks
derived from real-world use cases, and OdysseyBench-Neo with 302 newly
synthesized complex tasks. Each task requires agent to identify essential
information from long-horizon interaction histories and perform multi-step
reasoning across various applications. To enable scalable benchmark creation,
we propose HomerAgents, a multi-agent framework that automates the generation
of long-horizon workflow benchmarks through systematic environment exploration,
task generation, and dialogue synthesis. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates
that OdysseyBench effectively challenges state-of-the-art LLM agents, providing
more accurate assessment of their capabilities in complex, real-world contexts
compared to existing atomic task benchmarks. We believe that OdysseyBench will
serve as a valuable resource for advancing the development and evaluation of
LLM agents in real-world productivity scenarios. In addition, we release
OdysseyBench and HomerAgents to foster research along this line.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）在处理逻辑丰富的自然语言指令时的表现，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出LogicIFGen框架，从代码函数生成可验证的指令，并构建LogicIFEval基准测试集（426条指令）。

Result: 实验显示，当前最先进的LLMs在LogicIFEval上表现不佳，正确率低于60%。

Conclusion: LLMs在遵循复杂逻辑指令方面存在显著不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Instruction following has catalyzed the recent era of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and is the foundational skill underpinning more advanced capabilities
such as reasoning and agentic behaviors. As tasks grow more challenging, the
logic structures embedded in natural language instructions becomes increasingly
intricate. However, how well LLMs perform on such logic-rich instructions
remains under-explored. We propose LogicIFGen and LogicIFEval. LogicIFGen is a
scalable, automated framework for generating verifiable instructions from code
functions, which can naturally express rich logic such as conditionals,
nesting, recursion, and function calls. We further curate a collection of
complex code functions and use LogicIFGen to construct LogicIFEval, a benchmark
comprising 426 verifiable logic-rich instructions. Our experiments demonstrate
that current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to correctly follow the
instructions in LogicIFEval. Most LLMs can only follow fewer than 60% of the
instructions, revealing significant deficiencies in the instruction-following
ability. Code and Benchmark: https://github.com/mianzhang/LogicIF

TL;DR: 论文揭示了扩散大语言模型（dLLMs）在生成文本时存在的时间振荡现象，并提出两种方法利用时间一致性提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前解码策略丢弃中间预测，而正确结果可能在中间步骤出现但被后续步骤覆盖，导致性能损失。

Method: 1) 时间自一致性投票（训练无关的解码策略）；2) 时间一致性强化（通过时间语义熵作为奖励信号）。

Result: 实验表明，方法显著提升了性能，如Countdown数据集上平均提升24.7%。

Conclusion: 时间动态在dLLMs中具有潜力，提出的工具简单有效。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative
denoising, yet current decoding strategies discard rich intermediate
predictions in favor of the final output. Our work here reveals a critical
phenomenon, temporal oscillation, where correct answers often emerge in the
middle process, but are overwritten in later denoising steps. To address this
issue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal
consistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time
decoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select
the most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal
Consistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a
measure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward
signal to encourage stable generations. Empirical results across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using the negative
TSE reward alone, we observe a remarkable average improvement of 24.7% on the
Countdown dataset over an existing dLLM. Combined with the accuracy reward, we
achieve absolute gains of 2.0% on GSM8K, 4.3% on MATH500, 6.6% on SVAMP, and
25.3% on Countdown, respectively. Our findings underscore the untapped
potential of temporal dynamics in dLLMs and offer two simple yet effective
tools to harness them.

Abstract: Addressing plant diseases and pests is critical for enhancing crop production
and preventing economic losses. Recent advances in artificial intelligence
(AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have significantly improved
the precision and efficiency of detection methods, surpassing the limitations
of manual identification. This study reviews modern computer-based techniques
for detecting plant diseases and pests from images, including recent AI
developments. The methodologies are organized into five categories:
hyperspectral imaging, non-visualization techniques, visualization approaches,
modified deep learning architectures, and transformer models. This structured
taxonomy provides researchers with detailed, actionable insights for selecting
advanced state-of-the-art detection methods. A comprehensive survey of recent
work and comparative studies demonstrates the consistent superiority of modern
AI-based approaches, which often outperform older image analysis methods in
speed and accuracy. In particular, vision transformers such as the Hierarchical
Vision Transformer (HvT) have shown accuracy exceeding 99.3% in plant disease
detection, outperforming architectures like MobileNetV3. The study concludes by
discussing system design challenges, proposing solutions, and outlining
promising directions for future research.

TL;DR: ImageDDI框架通过结合分子图像信息和功能基序序列，提升了药物相互作用（DDI）预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在药物相互作用预测中受限于功能基序表示学习不足，而DDI主要由基序相互作用引起。

Method: ImageDDI将药物分子分解为功能基序，并通过Transformer编码器嵌入序列，同时利用分子图像信息增强空间表示。

Result: 实验表明ImageDDI在多个数据集上优于现有方法，并在2D和3D图像增强场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: ImageDDI通过融合全局和局部结构信息，显著提升了DDI预测性能。

Abstract: To mitigate the potential adverse health effects of simultaneous multi-drug
use, including unexpected side effects and interactions, accurately identifying
and predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is considered a crucial task in
the field of deep learning. Although existing methods have demonstrated
promising performance, they suffer from the bottleneck of limited functional
motif-based representation learning, as DDIs are fundamentally caused by motif
interactions rather than the overall drug structures. In this paper, we propose
an Image-enhanced molecular motif sequence representation framework for
\textbf{DDI} prediction, called ImageDDI, which represents a pair of drugs from
both global and local structures. Specifically, ImageDDI tokenizes molecules
into functional motifs. To effectively represent a drug pair, their motifs are
combined into a single sequence and embedded using a transformer-based encoder,
starting from the local structure representation. By leveraging the
associations between drug pairs, ImageDDI further enhances the spatial
representation of molecules using global molecular image information (e.g.
texture, shadow, color, and planar spatial relationships). To integrate
molecular visual information into functional motif sequence, ImageDDI employs
Adaptive Feature Fusion, enhancing the generalization of ImageDDI by
dynamically adapting the fusion process of feature representations.
Experimental results on widely used datasets demonstrate that ImageDDI
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, extensive experiments show that
ImageDDI achieved competitive performance in both 2D and 3D image-enhanced
scenarios compared to other models.

Abstract: Object detection (OD) has become vital for numerous computer vision
applications, but deploying it on resource-constrained IoT devices presents a
significant challenge. These devices, often powered by energy-efficient
microcontrollers, struggle to handle the computational load of deep
learning-based OD models. This issue is compounded by the rapid proliferation
of IoT devices, predicted to surpass 150 billion by 2030. TinyML offers a
compelling solution by enabling OD on ultra-low-power devices, paving the way
for efficient and real-time processing at the edge. Although numerous survey
papers have been published on this topic, they often overlook the optimization
challenges associated with deploying OD models in TinyML environments. To
address this gap, this survey paper provides a detailed analysis of key
optimization techniques for deploying OD models on resource-constrained
devices. These techniques include quantization, pruning, knowledge
distillation, and neural architecture search. Furthermore, we explore both
theoretical approaches and practical implementations, bridging the gap between
academic research and real-world edge artificial intelligence deployment.
Finally, we compare the key performance indicators (KPIs) of existing OD
implementations on microcontroller devices, highlighting the achieved maturity
level of these solutions in terms of both prediction accuracy and efficiency.
We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this
fast-evolving field:

Motivation: 混合光学神经网络（ONNs）在实时、功耗受限系统中具有高效能优势，但其应用受限于训练时的准确度差距以及模拟与实际系统间的差异。

Method: 提出任务无关和硬件无关的管道，包括预训练阶段的模型准确度估计和训练阶段的NTKD方法，以优化ONNs性能。

Result: 实验表明，该管道在多个数据集和硬件配置中显著提升了ONNs性能，适用于模拟和实际部署。

Conclusion: 该方法为混合光学神经网络的实用化部署提供了有效解决方案，解决了准确度和实现误差问题。

Abstract: Hybrid Optical Neural Networks (ONNs, typically consisting of an optical
frontend and a digital backend) offer an energy-efficient alternative to fully
digital deep networks for real-time, power-constrained systems. However, their
adoption is limited by two main challenges: the accuracy gap compared to
large-scale networks during training, and discrepancies between simulated and
fabricated systems that further degrade accuracy. While previous work has
proposed end-to-end optimizations for specific datasets (e.g., MNIST) and
optical systems, these approaches typically lack generalization across tasks
and hardware designs. To address these limitations, we propose a task-agnostic
and hardware-agnostic pipeline that supports image classification and
segmentation across diverse optical systems. To assist optical system design
before training, we estimate achievable model accuracy based on user-specified
constraints such as physical size and the dataset. For training, we introduce
Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation (NTKD), which aligns optical models with
electronic teacher networks, thereby narrowing the accuracy gap. After
fabrication, NTKD also guides fine-tuning of the digital backend to compensate
for implementation errors. Experiments on multiple datasets (e.g., MNIST,
CIFAR, Carvana Masking) and hardware configurations show that our pipeline
consistently improves ONN performance and enables practical deployment in both
pre-fabrication simulations and physical implementations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长序列视频生成框架在辅助能力、视觉质量和表达力方面存在显著限制，需要改进。

Method: MAViS通过多阶段协作智能体（如脚本写作、镜头设计、角色建模等）和3E原则（探索、检查、增强）实现高质量视频生成，并提出脚本写作指南优化兼容性。

Result: 实验表明，MAViS在辅助能力、视觉质量和表达力上达到最先进水平，并能生成多模态设计输出（视频、叙事和背景音乐）。

Conclusion: MAViS是首个提供多模态设计输出的框架，仅需简短用户提示即可生成高质量长序列视频故事，丰富了用户的灵感和创造力。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, long-sequence video generation frameworks still
suffer from significant limitations: poor assistive capability, suboptimal
visual quality, and limited expressiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we
propose MAViS, an end-to-end multi-agent collaborative framework for
long-sequence video storytelling. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across
multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling,
keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage,
agents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to
ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability
limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing
Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools.
Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness.
Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative
models and tools. With just a brief user prompt, MAViS is capable of producing
high-quality, expressive long-sequence video storytelling, enriching
inspirations and creativity for users. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is
the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with
narratives and background music.

TL;DR: MuGa-VTON是一种统一的多服装扩散框架，通过联合建模上下服装和个人身份，解决了现有虚拟试穿方法在身份保留和服装保真度上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿方法通常分开处理上下服装，依赖繁琐预处理，且难以保留个人特征（如纹身、配饰、体型），导致真实感和灵活性受限。

Method: 提出MuGa-VTON框架，包含三个关键模块：GRM（服装语义捕捉）、PRM（身份和姿态编码）和A-DiT（扩散变换器融合模块），支持基于提示的定制化。

Result: 在VITON-HD和DressCode基准测试中，MuGa-VTON在定性和定量评估上均优于现有方法，生成高保真且保留身份的结果。

Conclusion: MuGa-VTON为虚拟试穿提供了更真实、灵活的解决方案，适用于时尚零售和个性化应用。

Abstract: Virtual try-on seeks to generate photorealistic images of individuals in
desired garments, a task that must simultaneously preserve personal identity
and garment fidelity for practical use in fashion retail and personalization.
However, existing methods typically handle upper and lower garments separately,
rely on heavy preprocessing, and often fail to preserve person-specific cues
such as tattoos, accessories, and body shape-resulting in limited realism and
flexibility. To this end, we introduce MuGa-VTON, a unified multi-garment
diffusion framework that jointly models upper and lower garments together with
person identity in a shared latent space. Specifically, we proposed three key
modules: the Garment Representation Module (GRM) for capturing both garment
semantics, the Person Representation Module (PRM) for encoding identity and
pose cues, and the A-DiT fusion module, which integrates garment, person, and
text-prompt features through a diffusion transformer. This architecture
supports prompt-based customization, allowing fine-grained garment
modifications with minimal user input. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD
and DressCode benchmarks demonstrate that MuGa-VTON outperforms existing
methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, producing
high-fidelity, identity-preserving results suitable for real-world virtual
try-on applications.

TL;DR: CObL是一种基于扩散的架构，用于从图像中推断出遮挡顺序的对象层堆叠，无需用户提示或预先知道对象数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉任务需要将像素分组为对象并理解它们的空间关系，包括深度和横向关系。

Method: 使用Stable Diffusion作为先验，通过并行生成对象层堆叠，并通过推理时间指导确保层堆叠能复合回输入图像。

Result: CObL在合成图像上训练后，能零样本泛化到真实世界桌面的照片，处理不同数量的新对象。

Conclusion: CObL在无需用户提示或预先知道对象数量的情况下，实现了多遮挡对象的重建，且不限于训练环境。

Abstract: Vision benefits from grouping pixels into objects and understanding their
spatial relationships, both laterally and in depth. We capture this with a
scene representation comprising an occlusion-ordered stack of "object layers,"
each containing an isolated and amodally-completed object. To infer this
representation from an image, we introduce a diffusion-based architecture named
Concurrent Object Layers (CObL). CObL generates a stack of object layers in
parallel, using Stable Diffusion as a prior for natural objects and
inference-time guidance to ensure the inferred layers composite back to the
input image. We train CObL using a few thousand synthetically-generated images
of multi-object tabletop scenes, and we find that it zero-shot generalizes to
photographs of real-world tabletops with varying numbers of novel objects. In
contrast to recent models for amodal object completion, CObL reconstructs
multiple occluded objects without user prompting and without knowing the number
of objects beforehand. Unlike previous models for unsupervised object-centric
representation learning, CObL is not limited to the world it was trained in.

Conclusion: 本研究为评估叙事智能奠定了基础，并提供了改进多模态模型深层序列理解能力的实用方法。

Abstract: Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate a critical gap between
surface-level recognition and deep narrative reasoning when processing
sequential visual storytelling. Through a comprehensive investigation of manga
narrative understanding, we reveal that while recent large multimodal models
excel at individual panel interpretation, they systematically fail at temporal
causality and cross-panel cohesion, core requirements for coherent story
comprehension. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines
fine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and
retrieval-augmented assessment to systematically characterize these
limitations.
  Our methodology includes (i) a rigorous annotation protocol linking visual
elements to narrative structure through aligned light novel text, (ii)
comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning paradigms, including direct
inference and retrieval-augmented generation, and (iii) cross-modal similarity
analysis revealing fundamental misalignments in current VLMs' joint
representations. Applying this framework to Re:Zero manga across 11 chapters
with 308 annotated panels, we conduct the first systematic study of long-form
narrative understanding in VLMs through three core evaluation axes: generative
storytelling, contextual dialogue grounding, and temporal reasoning. Our
findings demonstrate that current models lack genuine story-level intelligence,
struggling particularly with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and
causal inference across extended sequences. This work establishes both the
foundation and practical methodology for evaluating narrative intelligence,
while providing actionable insights into the capability of deep sequential
understanding of Discrete Visual Narratives beyond basic recognition in
Multimodal Models.

TL;DR: VISOR是一种通过视觉输入实现行为控制的新方法，无需侵入模型内部，适用于各种VLM服务模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有行为控制方法（如系统提示）易检测且效果有限，而基于激活的转向向量需要侵入式访问模型内部，不适用于API服务和闭源部署。

Method: VISOR通过优化的视觉输入（通用转向图像）诱导目标激活模式，实现行为控制。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B上验证，VISOR在拒绝、奉承和生存本能任务中表现优异，单张150KB图像即可实现显著行为转变（高达25%），远超系统提示（3-4%）。

Conclusion: VISOR展示了视觉通道的行为操纵潜力，暴露了多模态模型的安全漏洞，亟需防御视觉转向攻击。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly being used in a broad range of
applications, bringing their security and behavioral control to the forefront.
While existing approaches for behavioral control or output redirection, like
system prompting in VLMs, are easily detectable and often ineffective,
activation-based steering vectors require invasive runtime access to model
internals--incompatible with API-based services and closed-source deployments.
We introduce VISOR (Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection), a
novel method that achieves sophisticated behavioral control through optimized
visual inputs alone. By crafting universal steering images that induce target
activation patterns, VISOR enables practical deployment across all VLM serving
modalities while remaining imperceptible compared to explicit textual
instructions. We validate VISOR on LLaVA-1.5-7B across three critical alignment
tasks: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. A single 150KB steering image
matches steering vector performance within 1-2% for positive behavioral shifts
while dramatically exceeding it for negative steering--achieving up to 25%
shifts from baseline compared to steering vectors' modest changes. Unlike
system prompting (3-4% shifts), VISOR provides robust bidirectional control
while maintaining 99.9% performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU tasks. Beyond
eliminating runtime overhead and model access requirements, VISOR exposes a
critical security vulnerability: adversaries can achieve sophisticated
behavioral manipulation through visual channels alone, bypassing text-based
defenses. Our work fundamentally re-imagines multimodal model control and
highlights the urgent need for defenses against visual steering attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近代日本文献（近代文书）具有重要历史价值，但转录工作耗时且数据稀缺，限制了OCR系统的训练效果。

Method: 利用平行文本行图像对，提出基于距离的目标函数（欧氏距离和最大均值差异），以减少自注意力特征之间的差距。

Result: 实验结果显示，字符错误率分别降低了2.23%（欧氏距离）和3.94%（最大均值差异），自注意力表示的质量也有所提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了历史文献OCR的性能，为数据稀缺问题提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Kindai documents, written in modern Japanese from the late 19th to early 20th
century, hold significant historical value for researchers studying societal
structures, daily life, and environmental conditions of that period. However,
transcribing these documents remains a labor-intensive and time-consuming task,
resulting in limited annotated data for training optical character recognition
(OCR) systems. This research addresses this challenge of data scarcity by
leveraging parallel textline images - pairs of original Kindai text and their
counterparts in contemporary Japanese fonts - to augment training datasets. We
introduce a distance-based objective function that minimizes the gap between
self-attention features of the parallel image pairs. Specifically, we explore
Euclidean distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as domain adaptation
metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the character
error rate (CER) by 2.23% and 3.94% over a Transformer-based OCR baseline when
using Euclidean distance and MMD, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
improves the discriminative quality of self-attention representations, leading
to more effective OCR performance for historical documents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在风险敏感应用中，Vision Transformers的概率校准至关重要，而传统的全局温度缩放方法存在局限性。

Abstract: Probability calibration is critical when Vision Transformers are deployed in
risk-sensitive applications. The standard fix, post-hoc temperature scaling,
uses a single global scalar and requires a held-out validation set. We
introduce Calibration Attention (CalAttn), a drop-in module that learns an
adaptive, per-instance temperature directly from the ViT's CLS token. Across
CIFAR-10/100, MNIST, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K, CalAttn reduces
calibration error by up to 4x on ViT-224, DeiT, and Swin, while adding under
0.1 percent additional parameters. The learned temperatures cluster tightly
around 1.0, in contrast to the large global values used by standard temperature
scaling. CalAttn is simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic, and yields
more trustworthy probabilities without sacrificing accuracy. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用框架DTLP-Net，用于解决医学图像分割中的半监督学习、领域泛化和领域适应问题，通过多样化的教师模型生成可靠的伪标签，并在多个任务中取得显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中标注数据有限和领域偏移是常见挑战，现有方法通常针对单一任务，效果有限。本文旨在开发一个通用框架，解决半监督医学图像分割（SSMIS）、半监督医学领域泛化（Semi-MDG）和无监督医学领域适应（UMDA）问题。

Method: 采用DTLP-Net框架，包含一个学生模型和两个多样化教师模型。第一个教师模型分离标注和未标注数据的训练过程，第二个教师模型定期动量更新以生成多样且可靠的伪标签。结合样本间和样本内数据增强，并通过标签传播增强模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上评估了SSMIS、UMDA和Semi-MDG任务，结果显示在所有任务中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DTLP-Net框架在解决医学图像分割中的复杂半监督学习问题上表现出潜力，能够生成可靠的伪标签并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Both limited annotation and domain shift are significant challenges
frequently encountered in medical image segmentation, leading to derivative
scenarios like semi-supervised medical (SSMIS), semi-supervised medical domain
generalization (Semi-MDG) and unsupervised medical domain adaptation (UMDA).
Conventional methods are generally tailored to specific tasks in isolation, the
error accumulation hinders the effective utilization of unlabeled data and
limits further improvements, resulting in suboptimal performance when these
issues occur. In this paper, we aim to develop a generic framework that masters
all three tasks. We found that the key to solving the problem lies in how to
generate reliable pseudo labels for the unlabeled data in the presence of
domain shift with labeled data and increasing the diversity of the model. To
tackle this issue, we employ a Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation Network
(DTLP-Net) to boosting the Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation.
Our DTLP-Net involves a single student model and two diverse teacher models,
which can generate reliable pseudo-labels for the student model. The first
teacher model decouple the training process with labeled and unlabeled data,
The second teacher is momentum-updated periodically, thus generating reliable
yet divers pseudo-labels. To fully utilize the information within the data, we
adopt inter-sample and intra-sample data augmentation to learn the global and
local knowledge. In addition, to further capture the voxel-level correlations,
we propose label propagation to enhance the model robust. We evaluate our
proposed framework on five benchmark datasets for SSMIS, UMDA, and Semi-MDG
tasks. The results showcase notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art
methods across all five settings, indicating the potential of our framework to
tackle more challenging SSL scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在盲脸恢复中存在适应性差距，主要源于高质量与低质量图像以及合成与真实图像之间的差异。

Method: FLIPNET采用统一网络，切换恢复和退化模式，分别实现真实脸恢复和合成真实退化图像。

Result: FLIPNET在真实性和保真度上优于现有方法，且在模拟真实退化方面表现更优。

Conclusion: FLIPNET有效解决了扩散模型在盲脸恢复中的适应性问题，为实际应用提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Although diffusion prior is rising as a powerful solution for blind face
restoration (BFR), the inherent gap between the vanilla diffusion model and BFR
settings hinders its seamless adaptation. The gap mainly stems from the
discrepancy between 1) high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) images and 2)
synthesized and real-world images. The vanilla diffusion model is trained on
images with no or less degradations, whereas BFR handles moderately to severely
degraded images. Additionally, LQ images used for training are synthesized by a
naive degradation model with limited degradation patterns, which fails to
simulate complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. In this
work, we use a unified network FLIPNET that switches between two modes to
resolve specific gaps. In Restoration mode, the model gradually integrates
BFR-oriented features and face embeddings from LQ images to achieve authentic
and faithful face restoration. In Degradation mode, the model synthesizes
real-world like degraded images based on the knowledge learned from real-world
degradation datasets. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our
model 1) outperforms previous diffusion prior based BFR methods in terms of
authenticity and fidelity, and 2) outperforms the naive degradation model in
modeling the real-world degradations.

Result: 实验证明AutoSAME在分割、关键点定位和指标测量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AutoSAME通过结合分割与定位任务，优化了左心室指标测量，符合临床指南。

Abstract: Left ventricular (LV) indicator measurements following clinical
echocardiog-raphy guidelines are important for diagnosing cardiovascular
disease. Alt-hough existing algorithms have explored automated LV
quantification, they can struggle to capture generic visual representations due
to the normally small training datasets. Therefore, it is necessary to
introduce vision founda-tional models (VFM) with abundant knowledge. However,
VFMs represented by the segment anything model (SAM) are usually suitable for
segmentation but incapable of identifying key anatomical points, which are
critical in LV indicator measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework named AutoSAME, combining the powerful visual understanding of SAM
with seg-mentation and landmark localization tasks simultaneously.
Consequently, the framework mimics the operation of cardiac sonographers,
achieving LV indi-cator measurements consistent with clinical guidelines. We
further present fil-tered cross-branch attention (FCBA) in AutoSAME, which
leverages relatively comprehensive features in the segmentation to enhance the
heatmap regression (HR) of key points from the frequency domain perspective,
optimizing the vis-ual representation learned by the latter. Moreover, we
propose spatial-guided prompt alignment (SGPA) to automatically generate prompt
embeddings guid-ed by spatial properties of LV, thereby improving the accuracy
of dense pre-dictions by prior spatial knowledge. The extensive experiments on
an echocar-diography dataset demonstrate the efficiency of each design and the
superiori-ty of our AutoSAME in LV segmentation, landmark localization, and
indicator measurements. The code will be available at

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于基线，定量和定性结果均有提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需标注的情况下，有效提升了模型对复杂虚假相关性的鲁棒性。

Abstract: To enhance group robustness to spurious correlations, prior work often relies
on auxiliary annotations for groups or spurious features and assumes identical
sets of groups across source and target domains. These two requirements are
both unnatural and impractical in real-world settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a method that leverages the semantic structure inherent
in class labels--specifically, superclass information--to naturally reduce
reliance on spurious features. Our model employs gradient-based attention
guided by a pre-trained vision-language model to disentangle
superclass-relevant and irrelevant features. Then, by promoting the use of all
superclass-relevant features for prediction, our approach achieves robustness
to more complex spurious correlations without the need to annotate any source
samples. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms baselines in domain generalization tasks, with clear
improvements in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations.

Conclusion: 该框架能够生成高度可控且逼真的人体视频，为视频生成提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Generating human videos with realistic and controllable motions is a
challenging task. While existing methods can generate visually compelling
videos, they lack separate control over four key video elements: foreground
subject, background video, human trajectory and action patterns. In this paper,
we propose a decomposed human motion control and video generation framework
that explicitly decouples motion from appearance, subject from background, and
action from trajectory, enabling flexible mix-and-match composition of these
elements. Concretely, we first build a ground-aware 3D world coordinate system
and perform motion editing directly in the 3D space. Trajectory control is
implemented by unprojecting edited 2D trajectories into 3D with focal-length
calibration and coordinate transformation, followed by speed alignment and
orientation adjustment; actions are supplied by a motion bank or generated via
text-to-motion methods. Then, based on modern text-to-video diffusion
transformer models, we inject the subject as tokens for full attention,
concatenate the background along the channel dimension, and add motion
(trajectory and action) control signals by addition. Such a design opens up the
possibility for us to generate realistic videos of anyone doing anything
anywhere. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world cases
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
element-wise controllability and overall video quality.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在文档理解中表现优异，但其推理过程缺乏透明性，难以在高风险领域（如法律、金融、医疗）中确保可靠性和可信度。现有方法存在灾难性遗忘、适应性差和跨领域任务泛化能力有限的问题。

Method: 提出DocThinker，一种基于规则的强化学习框架，通过策略学习动态优化推理策略，生成可解释的中间结果（如结构化推理过程、重述问题、支持答案的兴趣区域和最终答案）。结合多目标规则奖励和KL约束优化，减少灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DocThinker显著提高了泛化能力，并生成更易解释和理解的推理步骤。

Conclusion: 强化学习是增强多模态大语言模型在文档理解中可解释性和适应性的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in document understanding. However, their reasoning processes
remain largely black-box, making it difficult to ensure reliability and
trustworthiness, especially in high-stakes domains such as legal, financial,
and medical document analysis. Existing methods use fixed Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) but suffer from catastrophic
forgetting, poor adaptability, and limited generalization across domain tasks.
In this paper, we propose DocThinker, a rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL)
framework for dynamic inference-time reasoning. Instead of relying on static
CoT templates, DocThinker autonomously refines reasoning strategies via policy
learning, generating explainable intermediate results, including structured
reasoning processes, rephrased questions, regions of interest (RoI) supporting
the answer, and the final answer. By integrating multi-objective rule-based
rewards and KL-constrained optimization, our method mitigates catastrophic
forgetting and enhances both adaptability and transparency. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DocThinker significantly
improves generalization while producing more explainable and
human-understandable reasoning steps. Our findings highlight RL as a powerful
alternative for enhancing explainability and adaptability in MLLM-based
document understanding. Code will be available at

Motivation: 现有DETR-based方法因查询初始化缺乏明确语义导致性能不佳，需改进。

Method: 提出QueryCraft框架，包含ACTOR（跨模态Transformer）和PDQD（感知蒸馏查询解码器），通过语言引导和对象类别感知生成语义化查询。

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO基准测试中达到SOTA性能，泛化能力强。

Conclusion: QueryCraft通过语义化查询初始化显著提升了HOI检测性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize human-object pairs
and recognize their interactions in images. Although DETR-based methods have
recently emerged as the mainstream framework for HOI detection, they still
suffer from a key limitation: Randomly initialized queries lack explicit
semantics, leading to suboptimal detection performance. To address this
challenge, we propose QueryCraft, a novel plug-and-play HOI detection framework
that incorporates semantic priors and guided feature learning through
transformer-based query initialization. Central to our approach is
\textbf{ACTOR} (\textbf{A}ction-aware \textbf{C}ross-modal
\textbf{T}ransf\textbf{OR}mer), a cross-modal Transformer encoder that jointly
attends to visual regions and textual prompts to extract action-relevant
features. Rather than merely aligning modalities, ACTOR leverages
language-guided attention to infer interaction semantics and produce
semantically meaningful query representations. To further enhance object-level
query quality, we introduce a \textbf{P}erceptual \textbf{D}istilled
\textbf{Q}uery \textbf{D}ecoder (\textbf{PDQD}), which distills object category
awareness from a pre-trained detector to serve as object query initiation. This
dual-branch query initialization enables the model to generate more
interpretable and effective queries for HOI detection. Extensive experiments on
HICO-Det and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization. Code will be released
upon publication.

Specifically, Yan comprises three core modules. AAA-level Simulation: We design
a highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based
shift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS
interactive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical
autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into
open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the
VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive
video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from
different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to
blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to
user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that
explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering,
enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through
text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing
interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a
comprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the
next generation of creative tools, media, and entertainment. The project page

Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型规模和复杂性增加，微调成本高昂，需要一种高效方法将适应知识从弱模型迁移到强模型。

Result: 实验表明TransMiter能高效迁移知识，保持泛化能力，且在少量标注数据下性能超越微调模型。

Conclusion: TransMiter是一种高效、轻量的解决方案，适用于不同规模和架构的视觉语言模型。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in various visual
recognition tasks due to their remarkable generalization capabilities. As these
models grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the
need to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance
'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited
transferability across models due to their model-specific design and high
computational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic
adapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language
models 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between
pre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained,
this knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without
the need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few
layers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing
the process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain,
often surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost.
Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and
efficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization
abilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual
recognition tasks.

Abstract: Shooting video with a handheld mobile phone, the most common photographic
device, often results in blurry frames due to shaking hands and other
instability factors. Although previous video deblurring methods have achieved
impressive progress, they still struggle to perform satisfactorily on
real-world handheld video due to the blur domain gap between training and
testing data. To address the issue, we propose a self-supervised method for
handheld video deblurring, which is driven by sharp clues in the video. First,
to train the deblurring model, we extract the sharp clues from the video and
take them as misalignment labels of neighboring blurry frames. Second, to
improve the model's ability, we propose a novel Self-Enhanced Video Deblurring
(SEVD) method to create higher-quality paired video data. Third, we propose a
Self-Constrained Spatial Consistency Maintenance (SCSCM) method to regularize
the model, preventing position shifts between the output and input frames.
Moreover, we construct a synthetic and a real-world handheld video dataset for
handheld video deblurring. Extensive experiments on these two and other common
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing self-supervised ones. The code and datasets are publicly available at

Abstract: Neural artistic style transfers and blends the content and style
representation of one image with the style of another. This enables artists to
create unique innovative visuals and enhances artistic expression in various
fields including art, design, and film. Color transfer algorithms are an
important in digital image processing by adjusting the color information in a
target image based on the colors in the source image. Color transfer enhances
images and videos in film and photography, and can aid in image correction. We
introduce a methodology that combines neural artistic style with color
transfer. The method uses the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to
quantitatively evaluate color and luminance histogram matching algorithms
including Reinhard global color transfer, iteration distribution transfer
(IDT), IDT with regrain, Cholesky, and PCA between the original and neural
artistic style transferred image using deep learning. We estimate the color
channel kernel densities. Various experiments are performed to evaluate the KL
of these algorithms and their color histograms for style to content transfer.

Result: HVPL模型在避免灾难性遗忘方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HVPL模型有效解决了VIS中的类别遗忘问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: Video instance segmentation (VIS) has gained significant attention for its
capability in tracking and segmenting object instances across video frames.
However, most of the existing VIS approaches unrealistically assume that the
categories of object instances remain fixed over time. Moreover, they
experience catastrophic forgetting of old classes when required to continuously
learn object instances belonging to new categories. To resolve these
challenges, we develop a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model
that overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both
frame-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mitigate forgetting
at the frame level, we devise a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal
gradient correction (OGC) module. The OGC module helps the frame prompt encode
task-specific global instance information for new classes in each individual
frame by projecting its gradients onto the orthogonal feature space of old
classes. Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a
task-specific video prompt and a video context decoder. This decoder first
embeds structural inter-class relationships across frames into the frame prompt
features, and then propagates task-specific global video contexts from the
frame prompt features to the video prompt. Through rigorous comparisons, our
HVPL model proves to be more effective than baseline approaches. The code is
available at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/HVPL.

Result: AME在多种蒸馏架构和训练设置中表现优异，显著提升了泛化性能。

Conclusion: AME是一种即插即用的模块，无需修改主干架构，适用于广泛的视觉-语言蒸馏框架。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a long-established technique for knowledge
transfer, and has regained attention in the context of the recent emergence of
large vision-language models (VLMs). However, vision-language knowledge
distillation often requires sufficient training data to achieve robust
generalization on amples with ambiguous or boundary-adjacent representations,
which are associated with high predictive uncertainty. Critically, collecting
such large-scale, task-specific data for training is often impractical in
real-world scenarios. To address this major challenge arising from the
entanglement of uncertainty and cross-modal feature representation, we propose
Aligned Manifold Entropy for Robust Vision-Language Distillation (AME), aiming
to achieve robust generalization under real-world conditions. AME applies
entropy minimization over a reconfigured shared manifold, where multi-modal
data (i.e., image and text) are bridged through a pair of projection functions,
conducive to structural compression for cross-modal feature representations.
This enables robust knowledge distillation under low-data regimes, while
requiring no architectural modifications to the backbone. As a result, it can
serve as a plug-and-play module compatible with a wide range of vision-language
distillation frameworks. Notably, our theoretical analysis reveals that
integrating knowledge distillation with entropy minimization over the shared
manifold leads to a tighter generalization error bound. Extensive experiments
across diverse distillation architectures and training settings demonstrate
that AME consistently facilitates robust knowledge distillation, resulting in
superior generalization performance across a wide spectrum of downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 提出的框架不仅定量表现优异，还通过流形遍历展示了强解释性，为形状操作提供了平滑途径。

Abstract: Most prior unsupervised domain adaptation approaches for medical image
segmentation are narrowly tailored to either the source-accessible setting,
where adaptation is guided by source-target alignment, or the source-free
setting, which typically resorts to implicit supervision mechanisms such as
pseudo-labeling and model distillation. This substantial divergence in
methodological designs between the two settings reveals an inherent flaw: the
lack of an explicit, structured construction of anatomical knowledge that
naturally generalizes across domains and settings. To bridge this longstanding
divide, we introduce a unified, semantically grounded framework that supports
both source-accessible and source-free adaptation. Fundamentally distinct from
all prior works, our framework's adaptability emerges naturally as a direct
consequence of the model architecture, without the need for any handcrafted
adaptation strategies. Specifically, our model learns a domain-agnostic
probabilistic manifold as a global space of anatomical regularities, mirroring
how humans establish visual understanding. Thus, the structural content in each
image can be interpreted as a canonical anatomy retrieved from the manifold and
a spatial transformation capturing individual-specific geometry. This
disentangled, interpretable formulation enables semantically meaningful
prediction with intrinsic adaptability. Extensive experiments on challenging
cardiac and abdominal datasets show that our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results in both settings, with source-free performance closely
approaching its source-accessible counterpart, a level of consistency rarely
observed in prior works. Beyond quantitative improvement, we demonstrate strong
interpretability of the proposed framework via manifold traversal for smooth
shape manipulation.

### [88] [Learning Generalizable and Efficient Image Watermarking via Hierarchical Two-Stage Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08667)
*Ke Liu,Xuanhan Wang,Qilong Zhang,Lianli Gao,Jingkuan Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HiWL的分层水印学习方法，通过两阶段优化同时满足水印的不可见性、鲁棒性和广泛适用性。实验表明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度图像水印方法难以同时满足不可见性、鲁棒性和广泛适用性，因此需要一种更通用的解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段优化：第一阶段通过分布对齐学习建立共同潜在空间，第二阶段通过广义水印表示学习实现RGB空间中的水印分离。

Result: 水印提取准确率比现有方法高7.6%，处理100K图像仅需8秒。

Conclusion: HiWL在满足三个关键标准的同时，显著提升了水印提取性能和效率。

Abstract: Deep image watermarking, which refers to enable imperceptible watermark
embedding and reliable extraction in cover images, has shown to be effective
for copyright protection of image assets. However, existing methods face
limitations in simultaneously satisfying three essential criteria for
generalizable watermarking: 1) invisibility (imperceptible hide of watermarks),
2) robustness (reliable watermark recovery under diverse conditions), and 3)
broad applicability (low latency in watermarking process). To address these
limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL), a two-stage
optimization that enable a watermarking model to simultaneously achieve three
criteria. In the first stage, distribution alignment learning is designed to
establish a common latent space with two constraints: 1) visual consistency
between watermarked and non-watermarked images, and 2) information invariance
across watermark latent representations. In this way, multi-modal inputs
including watermark message (binary codes) and cover images (RGB pixels) can be
well represented, ensuring the invisibility of watermarks and robustness in
watermarking process thereby. The second stage employs generalized watermark
representation learning to establish a disentanglement policy for separating
watermarks from image content in RGB space. In particular, it strongly
penalizes substantial fluctuations in separated RGB watermarks corresponding to
identical messages. Consequently, HiWL effectively learns generalizable
latent-space watermark representations while maintaining broad applicability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method. In
particular, it achieves 7.6\% higher accuracy in watermark extraction than
existing methods, while maintaining extremely low latency (100K images
processed in 8s).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的多模态医学图像融合方法MMIF-AMIN，通过可逆密集网络和多尺度互补特征提取模块，结合自适应损失函数，显著提升了融合效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态医学图像融合（MMIF）旨在整合不同模态的图像以提供更全面的诊断信息，但如何同时捕捉独特和互补信息是关键挑战。

Method: 采用可逆密集网络（IDN）进行无损特征提取，设计多尺度互补特征提取模块（MCFEM）结合混合注意力机制和Transformer，并引入自适应损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，MMIF-AMIN在定量和定性分析中均优于九种现有方法，消融实验验证了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: MMIF-AMIN不仅在多模态医学图像融合中表现优异，还可扩展到其他图像融合任务。

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate images from
different modalities to produce a comprehensive image that enhances medical
diagnosis by accurately depicting organ structures, tissue textures, and
metabolic information. Capturing both the unique and complementary information
across multiple modalities simultaneously is a key research challenge in MMIF.
To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel image fusion method,
MMIF-AMIN, which features a new architecture that can effectively extract these
unique and complementary features. Specifically, an Invertible Dense Network
(IDN) is employed for lossless feature extraction from individual modalities.
To extract complementary information between modalities, a Multi-scale
Complementary Feature Extraction Module (MCFEM) is designed, which incorporates
a hybrid attention mechanism, convolutional layers of varying sizes, and
Transformers. An adaptive loss function is introduced to guide model learning,
addressing the limitations of traditional manually-designed loss functions and
enhancing the depth of data mining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MMIF-AMIN outperforms nine state-of-the-art MMIF methods, delivering superior
results in both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation experiments
confirm the effectiveness of each component of the proposed method.
Additionally, extending MMIF-AMIN to other image fusion tasks also achieves
promising performance.

*Yimeng Geng,Mingyang Zhao,Fan Xu,Guanglin Cao,Gaofeng Meng,Hongbin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PADReg提出了一种基于接触力的物理感知变形配准框架，显著提升了超声图像在大变形下的配准精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声图像的低对比度、噪声和模糊组织边界使得变形配准极具挑战性，现有方法缺乏物理可解释性和解剖对齐性。

Method: 利用机器人超声系统同步测量的接触力作为物理先验，构建像素级刚度图，结合力数据通过轻量级物理感知模块估计变形场。

Result: 实验表明，PADReg的HD95指标为12.90，比现有方法提升了21.34%。

Conclusion: PADReg通过引入物理约束，实现了更准确的超声图像变形配准，具有更好的解剖对齐性和物理合理性。

Abstract: Ultrasound deformable registration estimates spatial transformations between
pairs of deformed ultrasound images, which is crucial for capturing
biomechanical properties and enhancing diagnostic accuracy in diseases such as
thyroid nodules and breast cancer. However, ultrasound deformable registration
remains highly challenging, especially under large deformation. The inherently
low contrast, heavy noise and ambiguous tissue boundaries in ultrasound images
severely hinder reliable feature extraction and correspondence matching.
Existing methods often suffer from poor anatomical alignment and lack physical
interpretability. To address the problem, we propose PADReg, a physics-aware
deformable registration framework guided by contact force. PADReg leverages
synchronized contact force measured by robotic ultrasound systems as a physical
prior to constrain the registration. Specifically, instead of directly
predicting deformation fields, we first construct a pixel-wise stiffness map
utilizing the multi-modal information from contact force and ultrasound images.
The stiffness map is then combined with force data to estimate a dense
deformation field, through a lightweight physics-aware module inspired by
Hooke's law. This design enables PADReg to achieve physically plausible
registration with better anatomical alignment than previous methods relying
solely on image similarity. Experiments on in-vivo datasets demonstrate that it
attains a HD95 of 12.90, which is 21.34\% better than state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种仅使用RGB图像的越野自由空间检测方法ROD，通过预训练的Vision Transformer和轻量级解码器，显著提升了检测精度和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越野场景中自由空间检测因边界模糊而更具挑战性，现有基于多模态（RGB和LiDAR）的方法因计算量大无法满足实时需求。

Method: 采用预训练的Vision Transformer提取RGB图像特征，并设计轻量级解码器，避免使用LiDAR数据。

Result: ROD在ORFD和RELLIS-3D数据集上达到新SOTA，推理速度达50 FPS。

Conclusion: ROD证明了仅用RGB数据即可高效实现越野自由空间检测，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: Off-road freespace detection is more challenging than on-road scenarios
because of the blurred boundaries of traversable areas. Previous
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employ multi-modal fusion of RGB images and
LiDAR data. However, due to the significant increase in inference time when
calculating surface normal maps from LiDAR data, multi-modal methods are not
suitable for real-time applications, particularly in real-world scenarios where
higher FPS is required compared to slow navigation. This paper presents a novel
RGB-only approach for off-road freespace detection, named ROD, eliminating the
reliance on LiDAR data and its computational demands. Specifically, we utilize
a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract rich features from RGB
images. Additionally, we design a lightweight yet efficient decoder, which
together improve both precision and inference speed. ROD establishes a new SOTA
on ORFD and RELLIS-3D datasets, as well as an inference speed of 50 FPS,
significantly outperforming prior models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的无参考视频质量评估方法CBAND，用于解决视频压缩中的条带伪影问题，并发布了首个公开的视频数据集LIVE-YT-Banding。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高清晰度视频压缩中的条带伪影严重影响感知质量，现有数据集仅针对静态图像，无法捕捉时间动态，因此需要系统研究和新的数据集。

Method: 创建了包含160个AV1压缩视频的LIVE-YT-Banding数据集，收集了7,200个主观评价，并提出了基于深度神经网络嵌入的无参考质量评估模型CBAND。

Result: CBAND在条带伪影预测性能上显著优于现有模型，且速度更快，还可作为可微损失函数用于视频去条带优化。

Conclusion: CBAND和LIVE-YT-Banding数据集为视频质量评估和去条带研究提供了有效工具，推动了相关领域的发展。

Abstract: Although there have been notable advancements in video compression
technologies in recent years, banding artifacts remain a serious issue
affecting the quality of compressed videos, particularly on smooth regions of
high-definition videos. Noticeable banding artifacts can severely impact the
perceptual quality of videos viewed on a high-end HDTV or high-resolution
screen. Hence, there is a pressing need for a systematic investigation of the
banding video quality assessment problem for advanced video codecs. Given that
the existing publicly available datasets for studying banding artifacts are
limited to still picture data only, which cannot account for temporal banding
dynamics, we have created a first-of-a-kind open video dataset, dubbed
LIVE-YT-Banding, which consists of 160 videos generated by four different
compression parameters using the AV1 video codec. A total of 7,200 subjective
opinions are collected from a cohort of 45 human subjects. To demonstrate the
value of this new resources, we tested and compared a variety of models that
detect banding occurrences, and measure their impact on perceived quality.
Among these, we introduce an effective and efficient new no-reference (NR)
video quality evaluator which we call CBAND. CBAND leverages the properties of
the learned statistics of natural images expressed in the embeddings of deep
neural networks. Our experimental results show that the perceptual banding
prediction performance of CBAND significantly exceeds that of previous
state-of-the-art models, and is also orders of magnitude faster. Moreover,
CBAND can be employed as a differentiable loss function to optimize video
debanding models. The LIVE-YT-Banding database, code, and pre-trained model are
all publically available at https://github.com/uniqzheng/CBAND.

Motivation: 现有方法难以有效修复模型对罕见语义子群体的系统性错误，且手动生成训练图像易引入分布偏移和语义错误。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少了罕见案例相关的错误，提升了模型鲁棒性且未引入新错误。

Conclusion: 提出的针对性修复策略有效解决了视觉识别模型中的罕见语义子群体问题。

Abstract: Deep learning models for visual recognition often exhibit systematic errors
due to underrepresented semantic subpopulations. Although existing debugging
frameworks can pinpoint these failures by identifying key failure attributes,
repairing the model effectively remains difficult. Current solutions often rely
on manually designed prompts to generate synthetic training images -- an
approach prone to distribution shift and semantic errors. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce a model repair module that builds on an interpretable
failure attribution pipeline. Our approach uses a conditional text-to-image
model to generate semantically faithful and targeted images for failure cases.
To preserve the quality and relevance of the generated samples, we further
employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to filter the outputs, enforcing
alignment with the original data distribution and maintaining semantic
consistency. By retraining vision models with this rare-case-augmented
synthetic dataset, we significantly reduce errors associated with rare cases.
Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted repair strategy improves model
robustness without introducing new bugs. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有深度分割网络对所有像素平等加权，忽略了透镜结构子区域的不均匀性和边界区域的校准问题。

Method: ACW损失通过置信度阈值将透镜结构子区域分组，并应用区域加权损失；同时设计了自适应置信度阈值优化算法和BECE指标。

Result: 在临床数据集上，ACW显著优于其他方法，如IoU提升6.13%，DSC增加4.33%，BECE降低4.79%。

Conclusion: ACW和BECE有效提升了透镜结构分割的精度和校准性能。

Abstract: Precise lens structure segmentation is essential for the design of
intraocular lenses (IOLs) in cataract surgery. Existing deep segmentation
networks typically weight all pixels equally under cross-entropy (CE) loss,
overlooking the fact that sub-regions of lens structures are inhomogeneous
(e.g., some regions perform better than others) and that boundary regions often
suffer from poor segmentation calibration at the pixel level. Clinically,
experts annotate different sub-regions of lens structures with varying
confidence levels, considering factors such as sub-region proportions,
ambiguous boundaries, and lens structure shapes. Motivated by this observation,
we propose an Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss to group each lens structure
sub-region into different confidence sub-regions via a confidence threshold
from the unique region aspect, aiming to exploit the potential of expert
annotation confidence prior. Specifically, ACW clusters each target region into
low-confidence and high-confidence groups and then applies a region-weighted
loss to reweigh each confidence group. Moreover, we design an adaptive
confidence threshold optimization algorithm to adjust the confidence threshold
of ACW dynamically. Additionally, to better quantify the miscalibration errors
in boundary region segmentation, we propose a new metric, termed Boundary
Expected Calibration Error (BECE). Extensive experiments on a clinical lens
structure AS-OCT dataset and other multi-structure datasets demonstrate that
our ACW significantly outperforms competitive segmentation loss methods across
different deep segmentation networks (e.g., MedSAM). Notably, our method
surpasses CE with 6.13% IoU gain, 4.33% DSC increase, and 4.79% BECE reduction
in lens structure segmentation under U-Net. The code of this paper is available
at https://github.com/XiaoLing12138/Adaptive-Confidence-Wise-Loss.

TL;DR: 提出了一种框架，通过模拟社交网络的视频处理流程（压缩和调整大小），生成接近真实上传视频的数据，以提升深度伪造检测器在真实场景中的表现。


<details>

Motivation: 解决深度伪造检测器在真实社交网络视频中表现不佳的问题，尤其是由于平台专有压缩导致的低级别线索丢失。

Method: 通过分析少量上传视频估计压缩和调整大小参数，构建本地模拟器，生成大规模模拟数据。

Result: 模拟数据与真实上传视频的退化模式高度匹配，基于模拟数据微调的检测器表现接近真实数据训练的检测器。

Conclusion: 该框架为深度伪造检测器在压缩视频领域的实际部署提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The growing presence of AI-generated videos on social networks poses new
challenges for deepfake detection, as detectors trained under controlled
conditions often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios. A key factor
behind this gap is the aggressive, proprietary compression applied by platforms
like YouTube and Facebook, which launder low-level forensic cues. However,
replicating these transformations at scale is difficult due to API limitations
and data-sharing constraints. For these reasons, we propose a first framework
that emulates the video sharing pipelines of social networks by estimating
compression and resizing parameters from a small set of uploaded videos. These
parameters enable a local emulator capable of reproducing platform-specific
artifacts on large datasets without direct API access. Experiments on
FaceForensics++ videos shared via social networks demonstrate that our emulated
data closely matches the degradation patterns of real uploads. Furthermore,
detectors fine-tuned on emulated videos achieve comparable performance to those
trained on actual shared media. Our approach offers a scalable and practical
solution for bridging the gap between lab-based training and real-world
deployment of deepfake detectors, particularly in the underexplored domain of
compressed video content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中，3D检索系统需要处理复杂、模糊的描述，而现有系统仅适用于简单场景。

Method: ROOMELSA通过全景房间图像和自然语言查询，从大型数据库中检索对应的3D模型。

Result: 实验表明，现有模型在粗粒度检索上表现良好，但细粒度检索仍有挑战，尤其是对材质和结构的细微变化。

Conclusion: ROOMELSA为提升现实世界的3D识别系统提供了新基准，强调了视觉与语言理解的紧密结合。

Abstract: Recent 3D retrieval systems are typically designed for simple, controlled
scenarios, such as identifying an object from a cropped image or a brief
description. However, real-world scenarios are more complex, often requiring
the recognition of an object in a cluttered scene based on a vague, free-form
description. To this end, we present ROOMELSA, a new benchmark designed to
evaluate a system's ability to interpret natural language. Specifically,
ROOMELSA attends to a specific region within a panoramic room image and
accurately retrieves the corresponding 3D model from a large database. In
addition, ROOMELSA includes over 1,600 apartment scenes, nearly 5,200 rooms,
and more than 44,000 targeted queries. Empirically, while coarse object
retrieval is largely solved, only one top-performing model consistently ranked
the correct match first across nearly all test cases. Notably, a lightweight
CLIP-based model also performed well, although it struggled with subtle
variations in materials, part structures, and contextual cues, resulting in
occasional errors. These findings highlight the importance of tightly
integrating visual and language understanding. By bridging the gap between
scene-level grounding and fine-grained 3D retrieval, ROOMELSA establishes a new
benchmark for advancing robust, real-world 3D recognition systems.

Result: 在公开数据集上验证了方法的有效性，尤其在物种多样性和遮挡情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: DiffPose-Animal通过扩散模型和语言模型的结合，显著提升了动物姿态估计的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Animal pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with growing
importance in ecological monitoring, behavioral analysis, and intelligent
livestock management. Compared to human pose estimation, animal pose estimation
is more challenging due to high interspecies morphological diversity, complex
body structures, and limited annotated data. In this work, we introduce
DiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose
estimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal
reformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative
framework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint
generation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global
anatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific
prompts. These textual priors are encoded and fused with image features via
cross-attention modules to provide biologically meaningful constraints
throughout the denoising process. Additionally, a diffusion-based keypoint
decoder is designed to progressively refine pose predictions, improving
robustness to occlusion and annotation sparsity. Extensive experiments on
public animal pose datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization
capability of our method, especially under challenging scenarios with diverse
species, cluttered backgrounds, and incomplete keypoints.

Motivation: 传统均匀锐化强度忽略了纹理变化，导致视频质量下降，同时增加比特率，缺乏优化比特分配的技术。

Method: 使用编码树单元（CTU）分区掩码作为先验信息，指导并约束增加的比特分配，提出端到端的区域自适应视频锐化模型。

Result: 在基准测试中，模型在定性和定量上均表现出有效性。

Conclusion: RPO-AdaSharp成功解决了均匀锐化的问题，同时优化了比特分配，提升了视频质量并节省了比特率。

Abstract: Sharpening is a widely adopted video enhancement technique. However, uniform
sharpening intensity ignores texture variations, degrading video quality.
Sharpening also increases bitrate, and there's a lack of techniques to
optimally allocate these additional bits across diverse regions. Thus, this
paper proposes RPO-AdaSharp, an end-to-end region-adaptive video sharpening
model for both perceptual enhancement and bitrate savings. We use the coding
tree unit (CTU) partition mask as prior information to guide and constrain the
allocation of increased bits. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: MonoPartNeRF在复杂姿态和遮挡条件下显著提升了动态人体渲染的质量。

Abstract: In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved remarkable
progress in dynamic human reconstruction and rendering. Part-based rendering
paradigms, guided by human segmentation, allow for flexible parameter
allocation based on structural complexity, thereby enhancing representational
efficiency. However, existing methods still struggle with complex pose
variations, often producing unnatural transitions at part boundaries and
failing to reconstruct occluded regions accurately in monocular settings. We
propose MonoPartNeRF, a novel framework for monocular dynamic human rendering
that ensures smooth transitions and robust occlusion recovery. First, we build
a bidirectional deformation model that combines rigid and non-rigid
transformations to establish a continuous, reversible mapping between
observation and canonical spaces. Sampling points are projected into a
parameterized surface-time space (u, v, t) to better capture non-rigid motion.
A consistency loss further suppresses deformation-induced artifacts and
discontinuities. We introduce a part-based pose embedding mechanism that
decomposes global pose vectors into local joint embeddings based on body
regions. This is combined with keyframe pose retrieval and interpolation, along
three orthogonal directions, to guide pose-aware feature sampling. A learnable
appearance code is integrated via attention to model dynamic texture changes
effectively. Experiments on the ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap datasets demonstrate that
our method significantly outperforms prior approaches under complex pose and
occlusion conditions, achieving superior joint alignment, texture fidelity, and
structural continuity.

Abstract: Face aging or de-aging with generative AI has gained significant attention
for its applications in such fields like forensics, security, and media.
However, most state of the art methods rely on conditional Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion-based models, or Visual Language Models
(VLMs) to age or de-age faces based on predefined age categories and
conditioning via loss functions, fine-tuning, or text prompts. The reliance on
such conditioning leads to complex training requirements, increased data needs,
and challenges in generating consistent results. Additionally, identity
preservation is rarely taken into accountor evaluated on a single face
recognition system without any control or guarantees on whether identity would
be preserved in a generated aged/de-aged face. In this paper, we propose to
synthesize aged and de-aged faces via editing latent space of StyleGAN2 using a
simple support vector modeling of aging/de-aging direction and several feature
selection approaches. By using two state-of-the-art face recognition systems,
we empirically find the identity preserving subspace within the StyleGAN2
latent space, so that an apparent age of a given face can changed while
preserving the identity. We then propose a simple yet practical formula for
estimating the limits on aging/de-aging parameters that ensures identity
preservation for a given input face. Using our method and estimated parameters
we have generated a public dataset of synthetic faces at different ages that
can be used for benchmarking cross-age face recognition, age assurance systems,
or systems for detection of synthetic images. Our code and dataset are

between class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel
classification paradigm. With experimental analysis, we find that this paradigm
results in a highly challenging assumption for efficient scenarios: Image pixel
features should not vary for the same category in different images. To address
this dilemma, we propose a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that
explicitly learns feature and class offsets to dynamically refine both class
representations and spatial image features. Based on the proposed paradigm, we
construct an efficient semantic segmentation network, OffSeg. Notably, the
offset learning paradigm can be adopted to existing methods with no additional
architectural changes. Extensive experiments on four datasets, including
ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff-164K, and Pascal Context, demonstrate consistent
improvements with negligible parameters. For instance, on the ADE20K dataset,
our proposed offset learning paradigm improves SegFormer-B0, SegNeXt-T, and
Mask2Former-Tiny by 2.7%, 1.9%, and 2.6% mIoU, respectively, with only 0.1-0.2M
additional parameters required.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TARA的方法，通过引入令牌掩码和训练目标，解决了多概念LoRA模块组合中的干扰和空间对齐问题，实现了高效的多概念图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LoRA的方法在多概念生成时存在身份丢失和视觉特征泄漏问题，主要原因是令牌间干扰和空间对齐不足。

Method: 提出Token-Aware LoRA (TARA)，引入令牌掩码约束模块专注相关令牌，并通过训练目标优化空间对齐。

Result: 实验证明TARA能高效组合多概念，避免模块间干扰，有效保留视觉身份。

Conclusion: TARA为多概念文本到图像生成提供了一种高效且无干扰的解决方案。

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize novel images of a
specific subject or style using only a few reference images. Recent methods
based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable efficient single-concept
customization by injecting lightweight, concept-specific adapters into
pre-trained diffusion models. However, combining multiple LoRA modules for
multi-concept generation often leads to identity missing and visual feature
leakage. In this work, we identify two key issues behind these failures: (1)
token-wise interference among different LoRA modules, and (2) spatial
misalignment between the attention map of a rare token and its corresponding
concept-specific region. To address these issues, we propose Token-Aware LoRA
(TARA), which introduces a token mask to explicitly constrain each module to
focus on its associated rare token to avoid interference, and a training
objective that encourages the spatial attention of a rare token to align with
its concept region. Our method enables training-free multi-concept composition
by directly injecting multiple independently trained TARA modules at inference
time. Experimental results demonstrate that TARA enables efficient
multi-concept inference and effectively preserving the visual identity of each
concept by avoiding mutual interference between LoRA modules. The code and
models are available at https://github.com/YuqiPeng77/TARA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在空间推理方面表现有限，需要一种无需额外数据的方法生成3D对象原型。

Method: 采用代理式流程（设计师、编码员、视觉检查员）在细化循环中生成3D原型，包括几何和部件标签。

Result: 生成的渲染图像用于图像分类预训练任务，性能提升15%；用于微调CLIP模型，部件分割准确率提高55%。

Conclusion: 3DFroMLLM展示了无需额外数据即可生成高质量3D原型的潜力，显著提升了视觉语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Recent Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities in learning joint representations from text and images. However,
their spatial reasoning remains limited. We introduce 3DFroMLLM, a novel
framework that enables the generation of 3D object prototypes directly from
MLLMs, including geometry and part labels. Our pipeline is agentic, comprising
a designer, coder, and visual inspector operating in a refinement loop.
Notably, our approach requires no additional training data or detailed user
instructions. Building on prior work in 2D generation, we demonstrate that
rendered images produced by our framework can be effectively used for image
classification pretraining tasks and outperforms previous methods by 15%. As a
compelling real-world use case, we show that the generated prototypes can be
leveraged to improve fine-grained vision-language models by using the rendered,
part-labeled prototypes to fine-tune CLIP for part segmentation and achieving a
55% accuracy improvement without relying on any additional human-labeled data.

*Diego Frias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于方向性图像曲率分析的无参考图像质量评估（NR-IQA）新框架，通过各向异性纹理丰富度（ATR）度量图像质量，并在分类和量化图像退化方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无参考图像质量评估中如何准确分类和量化图像退化的问题。

Method: 定义ATR度量，使用两个可调阈值计算像素级纹理抑制，通过两阶段系统（分类和回归）评估图像质量。

Result: 在LIVE数据集上，ATR对高斯模糊和白噪声的Spearman相关性分别达到-0.93和-0.95，分类准确率超过97%，R2为0.892，RMSE为5.17 DMOS。

Conclusion: 该框架是一种高效的双用途工具，能够准确分类和量化图像退化。

Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for No-Reference Image Quality
Assessment (NR-IQA) founded on the analysis of directional image curvature.
Within this framework, we define a measure of Anisotropic Texture Richness
(ATR), which is computed at the pixel level using two tunable thresholds -- one
permissive and one restrictive -- that quantify orthogonal texture suppression.
When its parameters are optimized for a specific artifact, the resulting ATR
score serves as a high-performance quality metric, achieving Spearman
correlations with human perception of approximately -0.93 for Gaussian blur and
-0.95 for white noise on the LIVE dataset. The primary contribution is a
two-stage system that leverages the differential response of ATR to various
distortions. First, the system utilizes the signature from two specialist ATR
configurations to classify the primary artifact type (blur vs. noise) with over
97% accuracy. Second, following classification, it employs a dedicated
regression model mapping the relevant ATR score to a quality rating to quantify
the degradation. On a combined dataset, the complete system predicts human
scores with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.892 and a Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE) of 5.17 DMOS points. This error corresponds to just 7.4% of the
dataset's total quality range, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. This
establishes our framework as a robust, dual-purpose tool for the classification
and subsequent quantification of image degradation.

Method: 使用FFPN预测最优高频预处理策略，并通过伪标签训练FFPN，比较不同预处理类型和强度的率失真性能。

Result: 在多个数据集上的评估表明，该框架能显著提升主观质量并节省比特率。

Conclusion: 该框架在视频编码中实现了比特率与质量的最优权衡。

Abstract: High-frequency components are crucial for maintaining video clarity and
realism, but they also significantly impact coding bitrate, resulting in
increased bandwidth and storage costs. This paper presents an end-to-end
learning-based framework for adaptive high-frequency preprocessing to enhance
subjective quality and save bitrate in video coding. The framework employs the
Frequency-attentive Feature pyramid Prediction Network (FFPN) to predict the
optimal high-frequency preprocessing strategy, guiding subsequent filtering
operators to achieve the optimal tradeoff between bitrate and quality after
compression. For training FFPN, we pseudo-label each training video with the
optimal strategy, determined by comparing the rate-distortion (RD) performance
across different preprocessing types and strengths. Distortion is measured
using the latest quality assessment metric. Comprehensive evaluations on
multiple datasets demonstrate the visually appealing enhancement capabilities
and bitrate savings achieved by our framework.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis with neural models has advanced rapidly in recent years,
yet adapting these models to scene changes remains an open problem. Existing
methods are either labor-intensive, requiring extensive model retraining, or
fail to capture detailed types of changes over time. In this paper, we present
GaussianUpdate, a novel approach that combines 3D Gaussian representation with
continual learning to address these challenges. Our method effectively updates
the Gaussian radiance fields with current data while preserving information
from past scenes. Unlike existing methods, GaussianUpdate explicitly models
different types of changes through a novel multi-stage update strategy.
Additionally, we introduce a visibility-aware continual learning approach with
generative replay, enabling self-aware updating without the need to store
images. The experiments on the benchmark dataset demonstrate our method
achieves superior and real-time rendering with the capability of visualizing
changes over different times

Abstract: Robust depth estimation in light field imaging remains a critical challenge
for pattern recognition applications such as augmented reality, biomedical
imaging, and scene reconstruction. While existing approaches often rely heavily
on deep convolutional neural networks, they tend to incur high computational
costs and struggle in noisy real-world environments. This paper proposes a
novel lightweight depth estimation pipeline that integrates light field-based
disparity information with a directed random walk refinement algorithm. Unlike
traditional CNN-based methods, our approach enhances depth map consistency
without requiring extensive training or large-scale datasets. The proposed
method was evaluated on the 4D Light Field Benchmark dataset and a diverse set
of real-world images. Experimental results indicate that while performance
slightly declines under uncontrolled conditions, the algorithm consistently
maintains low computational complexity and competitive accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art deep learning models. These findings highlight the potential
of our method as a robust and efficient alternative for depth estimation and
segmentation in light field imaging. The work provides insights into practical
algorithm design for light field-based pattern recognition and opens new
directions for integrating probabilistic graph models with depth sensing
frameworks.

Conclusion: MaskClu通过联合优化密集语义重建和实例级对比学习，使ViTs能够从3D点云中学习更丰富且语义更有意义的表征。

Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently been widely applied to 3D point
cloud understanding, with masked autoencoding as the predominant pre-training
paradigm. However, the challenge of learning dense and informative semantic
features from point clouds via standard ViTs remains underexplored. We propose
MaskClu, a novel unsupervised pre-training method for ViTs on 3D point clouds
that integrates masked point modeling with clustering-based learning. MaskClu
is designed to reconstruct both cluster assignments and cluster centers from
masked point clouds, thus encouraging the model to capture dense semantic
information. Additionally, we introduce a global contrastive learning mechanism
that enhances instance-level feature learning by contrasting different masked
views of the same point cloud. By jointly optimizing these complementary
objectives, i.e., dense semantic reconstruction, and instance-level contrastive
learning. MaskClu enables ViTs to learn richer and more semantically meaningful
representations from 3D point clouds. We validate the effectiveness of our
method via multiple 3D tasks, including part segmentation, semantic
segmentation, object detection, and classification, where MaskClu sets new
competitive results. The code and models will be released

Motivation: 目前大多数自动化肿瘤分割和报告生成的研究集中在术前数据，术后影像分析关注较少。本研究旨在填补这一空白，提升术后评估和临床决策的效率。

Method: 使用Attention U-Net训练分割模型（术前非增强肿瘤核心、术后对比增强残留肿瘤和切除腔），DenseNet用于MR序列分类和肿瘤类型识别。模型集成到遵循RANO 2.0指南的报告流程中，并在多中心数据集上进行5折交叉验证。

Conclusion: 该流程实现了高效的术后评估，并集成到开源软件Raidionics中，为临床决策提供了标准化工具。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is essential for evaluating central nervous
system (CNS) tumors, guiding surgical planning, treatment decisions, and
assessing postoperative outcomes and complication risks. While recent work has
advanced automated tumor segmentation and report generation, most efforts have
focused on preoperative data, with limited attention to postoperative imaging
analysis. This study introduces a comprehensive pipeline for standardized
postsurtical reporting in CNS tumors. Using the Attention U-Net architecture,
segmentation models were trained for the preoperative (non-enhancing) tumor
core, postoperative contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity.
Additionally, MR sequence classification and tumor type identification for
contrast-enhancing lesions were explored using the DenseNet architecture. The
models were integrated into a reporting pipeline, following the RANO 2.0
guidelines. Training was conducted on multicentric datasets comprising 2000 to
7000 patients, using a 5-fold cross-validation. Evaluation included patient-,
voxel-, and object-wise metrics, with benchmarking against the latest BraTS
challenge results. The segmentation models achieved average voxel-wise Dice
scores of 87%, 66%, 70%, and 77% for the tumor core, non-enhancing tumor core,
contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity, respectively.
Classification models reached 99.5% balanced accuracy in MR sequence
classification and 80% in tumor type classification. The pipeline presented in
this study enables robust, automated segmentation, MR sequence classification,
and standardized report generation aligned with RANO 2.0 guidelines, enhancing
postoperative evaluation and clinical decision-making. The proposed models and
methods were integrated into Raidionics, open-source software platform for CNS
tumor analysis, now including a dedicated module for postsurgical analysis.

Abstract: LiDAR-based Place Recognition (LPR) remains a critical task in Embodied
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Autonomous Driving, primarily addressing
localization challenges in GPS-denied environments and supporting loop closure
detection. Existing approaches reduce place recognition to a Euclidean
distance-based metric learning task, neglecting the feature space's intrinsic
structures and intra-class variances. Such Euclidean-centric formulation
inherently limits the model's capacity to capture nonlinear data distributions,
leading to suboptimal performance in complex environments and temporal-varying
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-view network
based on an innovative fusion paradigm. Our framework introduces a
pseudo-global information guidance mechanism that coordinates multi-modal
branches to perform feature learning within a unified semantic space.
Concurrently, we propose a Manifold Adaptation and Pairwise Variance-Locality
Learning Metric that constructs a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix to
compute Mahalanobis distance, superseding traditional Euclidean distance
metrics. This geometric formulation enables the model to accurately
characterize intrinsic data distributions and capture complex inter-class
dependencies within the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance, particularly excelling
in complex environmental conditions.

Conclusion: 该系统提高了脊柱成像的一致性和可重复性，为手术导航提供了新工具。

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging is increasingly used in spinal procedures due to its
real-time, radiation-free capabilities; however, its effectiveness is hindered
by shadowing artifacts that obscure deeper tissue structures. Traditional
approaches, such as CT-to-US registration, incorporate anatomical information
from preoperative CT scans to guide interventions, but they are limited by
complex registration requirements, differences in spine curvature, and the need
for recent CT imaging. Recent shape completion methods can offer an alternative
by reconstructing spinal structures in US data, while being pretrained on large
set of publicly available CT scans. However, these approaches are typically
offline and have limited reproducibility. In this work, we introduce a novel
integrated system that combines robotic ultrasound with real-time shape
completion to enhance spinal visualization. Our robotic platform autonomously
acquires US sweeps of the lumbar spine, extracts vertebral surfaces from
ultrasound, and reconstructs the complete anatomy using a deep learning-based
shape completion network. This framework provides interactive, real-time
visualization with the capability to autonomously repeat scans and can enable
navigation to target locations. This can contribute to better consistency,
reproducibility, and understanding of the underlying anatomy. We validate our
approach through quantitative experiments assessing shape completion accuracy
and evaluations of multiple spine acquisition protocols on a phantom setup.
Additionally, we present qualitative results of the visualization on a
volunteer scan.

Abstract: Volumetric data compression is critical in fields like medical imaging,
scientific simulation, and entertainment. We introduce a structure-free neural
compression method combining Fourierfeature encoding with selective voxel
sampling, yielding compact volumetric representations and faster convergence.
Our dynamic voxel selection uses morphological dilation to prioritize active
regions, reducing redundant computation without any hierarchical metadata. In
the experiment, sparse training reduced training time by 63.7 % (from 30 to 11
minutes) with only minor quality loss: PSNR dropped 0.59 dB (from 32.60 to
32.01) and SSIM by 0.008 (from 0.948 to 0.940). The resulting neural
representation, stored solely as network weights, achieves a compression rate
of 14 and eliminates traditional data-loading overhead. This connects
coordinate-based neural representation with efficient volumetric compression,
offering a scalable, structure-free solution for practical applications.

Motivation: 面部变形攻击（MAD）威胁人脸识别安全，现有多模态基础模型（FMs）通常需要微调，而忽略了其直接部署的潜力。

Method: 利用CLIP模型，设计并聚合多个文本提示的嵌入，以更好地对齐MAD任务。

Result: 提示聚合显著提升了零样本检测性能。

Conclusion: 通过高效的提示工程，可以利用基础模型的内置多模态知识实现有效的MAD检测。

Abstract: Face Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) is a critical challenge in face
recognition security, where attackers can fool systems by interpolating the
identity information of two or more individuals into a single face image,
resulting in samples that can be verified as belonging to multiple identities
by face recognition systems. While multimodal foundation models (FMs) like CLIP
offer strong zero-shot capabilities by jointly modeling images and text, most
prior works on FMs for biometric recognition have relied on fine-tuning for
specific downstream tasks, neglecting their potential for direct, generalizable
deployment. This work explores a pure zero-shot approach to MAD by leveraging
CLIP without any additional training or fine-tuning, focusing instead on the
design and aggregation of multiple textual prompts per class. By aggregating
the embeddings of diverse prompts, we better align the model's internal
representations with the MAD task, capturing richer and more varied cues
indicative of bona-fide or attack samples. Our results show that prompt
aggregation substantially improves zero-shot detection performance,
demonstrating the effectiveness of exploiting foundation models' built-in
multimodal knowledge through efficient prompt engineering.

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition (SAR) has achieved impressive progress with
transformer architectures. However, existing methods often rely on complex
module compositions and heavy designs, leading to increased parameter counts,
high computational costs, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose a
unified spatio-temporal lightweight transformer framework that integrates
spatial and temporal modeling within a single attention module, eliminating the
need for separate temporal modeling blocks. This approach reduces redundant
computations while preserving temporal awareness within the spatial modeling
process. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified multi-scale pooling fusion
module that combines local and global pooling pathways to enhance the model's
ability to capture fine-grained local movements and overarching global motion
patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
lightweight model achieves a superior balance between accuracy and efficiency,
reducing parameter complexity by over 58% and lowering computational cost by
over 60% compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based baselines, while
maintaining competitive recognition performance.

interaction. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality data in this field
makes it difficult to precisely control storytelling tasks, including the
subject's position, appearance, clothing, expression, and posture, thereby
hindering further advancements. In this paper, we demonstrate that layout
conditions, such as the subject's position and detailed attributes, effectively
facilitate fine-grained interactions between frames. This not only strengthens
the consistency of the generated frame sequence but also allows for precise
control over the subject's position, appearance, and other key details.
Building on this, we introduce an advanced storytelling task: Layout-Togglable
Storytelling, which enables precise subject control by incorporating layout
conditions. To address the lack of high-quality datasets with layout
annotations for this task, we develop Lay2Story-1M, which contains over 1
million 720p and higher-resolution images, processed from approximately 11,300
hours of cartoon videos. Building on Lay2Story-1M, we create Lay2Story-Bench, a
benchmark with 3,000 prompts designed to evaluate the performance of different
methods on this task. Furthermore, we propose Lay2Story, a robust framework
based on the Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) architecture for Layout-Togglable
Storytelling tasks. Through both qualitative and quantitative experiments, we
find that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA)
techniques, achieving the best results in terms of consistency, semantic
correlation, and aesthetic quality.

*Elman Ghazaei,Erchan Aptoula*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的文本条件状态空间模型（TCSSM），用于解决变化检测视觉问答（CDVQA）中的域偏移问题，并引入了一个多模态多域数据集BrightVQA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统变化检测方法需要专业知识，而现有CDVQA方法假设训练和测试数据分布相似，不适用于实际应用中的域偏移问题。

Method: 提出TCSSM模型，结合双时相图像和地理灾害相关文本信息，提取跨域不变特征，动态预测输入相关参数。

Result: 实验表明，TCSSM在性能上优于现有先进模型。

Conclusion: TCSSM有效解决了CDVQA中的域偏移问题，BrightVQA数据集为域泛化研究提供了支持。

Abstract: The Earth's surface is constantly changing, and detecting these changes
provides valuable insights that benefit various aspects of human society. While
traditional change detection methods have been employed to detect changes from
bi-temporal images, these approaches typically require expert knowledge for
accurate interpretation. To enable broader and more flexible access to change
information by non-expert users, the task of Change Detection Visual Question
Answering (CDVQA) has been introduced. However, existing CDVQA methods have
been developed under the assumption that training and testing datasets share
similar distributions. This assumption does not hold in real-world
applications, where domain shifts often occur. In this paper, the CDVQA task is
revisited with a focus on addressing domain shift. To this end, a new
multi-modal and multi-domain dataset, BrightVQA, is introduced to facilitate
domain generalization research in CDVQA. Furthermore, a novel state space
model, termed Text-Conditioned State Space Model (TCSSM), is proposed. The
TCSSM framework is designed to leverage both bi-temporal imagery and
geo-disaster-related textual information in an unified manner to extract
domain-invariant features across domains. Input-dependent parameters existing
in TCSSM are dynamically predicted by using both bi-temporal images and
geo-disaster-related description, thereby facilitating the alignment between
bi-temporal visual data and the associated textual descriptions. Extensive
experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method against
state-of-the-art models, and superior performance is consistently demonstrated.
The code and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TaoCache是一种无需训练、即插即用的缓存策略，通过固定点视角预测噪声输出，特别适用于视频扩散模型的后期去噪阶段，显著提升视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缓存加速方法在跳过早期或中期去噪步骤时会导致结构差异，影响指令跟随和角色一致性，因此需要一种更有效的缓存策略。

Method: TaoCache通过校准余弦相似度和噪声增量的范数比，预测模型的噪声输出，保留高分辨率结构并支持激进跳过。

Result: 在Latte-1、OpenSora-Plan v110和Wan2.1等数据集上，TaoCache在相同加速条件下，视觉质量（LPIPS、SSIM、PSNR）显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TaoCache是一种高效且兼容性强的缓存策略，适用于基于DiT的框架，并能与其他加速方法无缝集成。

Abstract: Existing cache-based acceleration methods for video diffusion models
primarily skip early or mid denoising steps, which often leads to structural
discrepancies relative to full-timestep generation and can hinder instruction
following and character consistency. We present TaoCache, a training-free,
plug-and-play caching strategy that, instead of residual-based caching, adopts
a fixed-point perspective to predict the model's noise output and is
specifically effective in late denoising stages. By calibrating cosine
similarities and norm ratios of consecutive noise deltas, TaoCache preserves
high-resolution structure while enabling aggressive skipping. The approach is
orthogonal to complementary accelerations such as Pyramid Attention Broadcast
(PAB) and TeaCache, and it integrates seamlessly into DiT-based frameworks.
Across Latte-1, OpenSora-Plan v110, and Wan2.1, TaoCache attains substantially
higher visual quality (LPIPS, SSIM, PSNR) than prior caching methods under the
same speedups.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了使用预训练大语言模型（LLMs）进行颜色推荐的可能性，并开发了名为ColorGPT的管道，在颜色调色板完成和生成任务中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颜色在矢量图形设计中至关重要，但传统方法在颜色推荐任务中表现不佳。研究旨在验证预训练LLMs是否能成为更优的设计助手。

Method: 开发了ColorGPT管道，通过测试多种颜色表示和提示工程技术，专注于颜色调色板完成和生成任务。

Result: 实验表明，ColorGPT在颜色推荐准确性和调色板分布上优于现有方法，同时在颜色多样性和相似性上也有所提升。

Conclusion: 预训练LLMs在颜色推荐任务中具有潜力，ColorGPT为设计领域提供了一种新的高效工具。

Abstract: Colors play a crucial role in the design of vector graphic documents by
enhancing visual appeal, facilitating communication, improving usability, and
ensuring accessibility. In this context, color recommendation involves
suggesting appropriate colors to complete or refine a design when one or more
colors are missing or require alteration. Traditional methods often struggled
with these challenges due to the complex nature of color design and the limited
data availability. In this study, we explored the use of pretrained Large
Language Models (LLMs) and their commonsense reasoning capabilities for color
recommendation, raising the question: Can pretrained LLMs serve as superior
designers for color recommendation tasks? To investigate this, we developed a
robust, rigorously validated pipeline, ColorGPT, that was built by
systematically testing multiple color representations and applying effective
prompt engineering techniques. Our approach primarily targeted color palette
completion by recommending colors based on a set of given colors and
accompanying context. Moreover, our method can be extended to full palette
generation, producing an entire color palette corresponding to a provided
textual description. Experimental results demonstrated that our LLM-based
pipeline outperformed existing methods in terms of color suggestion accuracy
and the distribution of colors in the color palette completion task. For the
full palette generation task, our approach also yielded improvements in color
diversity and similarity compared to current techniques.

*Ming Nie,Chunwei Wang,Hang Xu,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KFFocus提出了一种高效压缩视频令牌并突出关键帧信息的方法，显著提升了视频LLMs的计算效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频LLMs在压缩视频时忽略了关键帧的不均匀分布，可能导致重要信息的遗漏。

Method: KFFocus通过改进的采样策略和动态压缩比分配，结合时空建模模块，优化视频令牌压缩。

Result: 在长视频场景的实验中，KFFocus显著优于现有方法，提高了计算效率和准确性。

Conclusion: KFFocus为视频LLMs提供了一种高效且精确的压缩方法，解决了关键帧信息丢失的问题。

Abstract: Recently, with the emergence of large language models, multimodal LLMs have
demonstrated exceptional capabilities in image and video modalities. Despite
advancements in video comprehension, the substantial computational demands of
long video sequences lead current video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to employ compression
strategies at both the inter-frame level (e.g., uniform sampling of video
frames) and intra-frame level (e.g., condensing all visual tokens of each frame
into a limited number). However, this approach often neglects the uneven
temporal distribution of critical information across frames, risking the
omission of keyframes that contain essential temporal and semantic details. To
tackle these challenges, we propose KFFocus, a method designed to efficiently
compress video tokens and emphasize the informative context present within
video frames. We substitute uniform sampling with a refined approach inspired
by classic video compression principles to identify and capture keyframes based
on their temporal redundancy. By assigning varying condensation ratios to
frames based on their contextual relevance, KFFocus efficiently reduces token
redundancy while preserving informative content details. Additionally, we
introduce a spatiotemporal modeling module that encodes both the temporal
relationships between video frames and the spatial structure within each frame,
thus providing Vid-LLMs with a nuanced understanding of spatial-temporal
dynamics. Extensive experiments on widely recognized video understanding
benchmarks, especially long video scenarios, demonstrate that KFFocus
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving substantial computational
efficiency and enhanced accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动表示无法从多尺度捕捉运动且缺乏组合灵活性，限制了复杂模式建模和任务泛化能力。

Method: 引入MSQ方法，通过多尺度离散化空间和时间维度的运动序列，使用不同编码器捕捉空间粒度，并建立生成掩码建模模型。

Result: MSQ实现了运动令牌的无缝组合，无需专门设计或重新训练，并在多个基准上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MSQ为运动生成提供了更灵活和高效的多尺度表示，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in human motion generation, current motion
representations, typically formulated as discrete frame sequences, still face
two critical limitations: (i) they fail to capture motion from a multi-scale
perspective, limiting the capability in complex patterns modeling; (ii) they
lack compositional flexibility, which is crucial for model's generalization in
diverse generation tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce MSQ, a
novel quantization method that compresses the motion sequence into multi-scale
discrete tokens across spatial and temporal dimensions. MSQ employs distinct
encoders to capture body parts at varying spatial granularities and temporally
interpolates the encoded features into multiple scales before quantizing them
into discrete tokens. Building on this representation, we establish a
generative mask modeling model to effectively support motion editing, motion
control, and conditional motion generation. Through quantitative and
qualitative analysis, we show that our quantization method enables the seamless
composition of motion tokens without requiring specialized design or
re-training. Furthermore, extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing baseline methods on various benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决大核卷积网络（ConvNets）参数和计算成本高、ERF分布不理想的问题，提出更高效的方法扩展ERF并保持其AGD。

Method: 通过组合小核（如7×7、9×9、11×11）扩展ERF，设计Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator和Layer Operator，构建UniConvNet模型。

Result: UniConvNet在ImageNet-1K、COCO2017和ADE20K上表现优于现有CNN和ViT模型，UniConvNet-T达到84.2% top-1准确率（30M参数，5.1G FLOPs）。

Conclusion: UniConvNet通过高效扩展ERF并保持AGD，成为通用且高性能的ConvNet模型，适用于不同规模任务。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with large effective receptive field
(ERF), still in their early stages, have demonstrated promising effectiveness
while constrained by high parameters and FLOPs costs and disrupted
asymptotically Gaussian distribution (AGD) of ERF. This paper proposes an
alternative paradigm: rather than merely employing extremely large ERF, it is
more effective and efficient to expand the ERF while maintaining AGD of ERF by
proper combination of smaller kernels, such as $7\times{7}$, $9\times{9}$,
$11\times{11}$. This paper introduces a Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator
and designs a Layer Operator as the fundamental operator from the perspective
of receptive field. The ERF can be expanded to the level of existing
large-kernel ConvNets through the stack of proposed modules while maintaining
AGD of ERF. Using these designs, we propose a universal model for ConvNet of
any scale, termed UniConvNet. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, COCO2017,
and ADE20K demonstrate that UniConvNet outperforms state-of-the-art CNNs and
ViTs across various vision recognition tasks for both lightweight and
large-scale models with comparable throughput. Surprisingly, UniConvNet-T
achieves $84.2\%$ ImageNet top-1 accuracy with $30M$ parameters and $5.1G$
FLOPs. UniConvNet-XL also shows competitive scalability to big data and large
models, acquiring $88.4\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Code and models are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的Inter-correction Retinex模型（IRetinex），通过减少分解和增强阶段的组件间残差（ICR），显著提升了低光图像增强的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Retinex方法在分解图像为光照和反射组件时，未能充分处理组件间残差（ICR），影响了分解精度和最终图像质量。

Method: 在分解阶段引入组件间残差减少模块，降低光照和反射组件的特征相似性；在增强阶段利用特征相似性检测并减轻ICR的影响。

Result: 在三个低光基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在定性和定量上均优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 通过减少ICR，IRetinex模型显著提升了低光图像增强的性能。

Abstract: In low-light image enhancement, Retinex-based deep learning methods have
garnered significant attention due to their exceptional interpretability. These
methods decompose images into mutually independent illumination and reflectance
components, allows each component to be enhanced separately. In fact, achieving
perfect decomposition of illumination and reflectance components proves to be
quite challenging, with some residuals still existing after decomposition. In
this paper, we formally name these residuals as inter-component residuals
(ICR), which has been largely underestimated by previous methods. In our
investigation, ICR not only affects the accuracy of the decomposition but also
causes enhanced components to deviate from the ideal outcome, ultimately
reducing the final synthesized image quality. To address this issue, we propose
a novel Inter-correction Retinex model (IRetinex) to alleviate ICR during the
decomposition and enhancement stage. In the decomposition stage, we leverage
inter-component residual reduction module to reduce the feature similarity
between illumination and reflectance components. In the enhancement stage, we
utilize the feature similarity between the two components to detect and
mitigate the impact of ICR within each enhancement unit. Extensive experiments
on three low-light benchmark datasets demonstrated that by reducing ICR, our
method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少对专家标注的依赖，解决现有方法因忽略模型认知偏差和低质量伪标签导致的问题。

Method: 提出UC-Seg框架，包含交叉子网一致性保持策略（CCP）和不确定性感知伪标签生成（UPG）。

Result: 在多种医学图像模态上表现优于现有半监督方法。

Conclusion: UC-Seg有效解决了认知偏差和伪标签质量问题，提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has gained considerable popularity in medical image
segmentation tasks due to its capability to reduce reliance on expert-examined
annotations. Several mean-teacher (MT) based semi-supervised methods utilize
consistency regularization to effectively leverage valuable information from
unlabeled data. However, these methods often heavily rely on the student model
and overlook the potential impact of cognitive biases within the model.
Furthermore, some methods employ co-training using pseudo-labels derived from
different inputs, yet generating high-confidence pseudo-labels from perturbed
inputs during training remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose an Uncertainty-aware Cross-training framework for semi-supervised
medical image Segmentation (UC-Seg). Our UC-Seg framework incorporates two
distinct subnets to effectively explore and leverage the correlation between
them, thereby mitigating cognitive biases within the model. Specifically, we
present a Cross-subnet Consistency Preservation (CCP) strategy to enhance
feature representation capability and ensure feature consistency across the two
subnets. This strategy enables each subnet to correct its own biases and learn
shared semantics from both labeled and unlabeled data. Additionally, we propose
an Uncertainty-aware Pseudo-label Generation (UPG) component that leverages
segmentation results and corresponding uncertainty maps from both subnets to
generate high-confidence pseudo-labels. We extensively evaluate the proposed
UC-Seg on various medical image segmentation tasks involving different modality
images, such as MRI, CT, ultrasound, colonoscopy, and so on. The results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation accuracy and
generalization performance compared to other state-of-the-art semi-supervised
methods. Our code will be released at https://github.com/taozh2017/UCSeg.

Motivation: 由于深度伪造内容越来越逼真，人工标注变得不可靠且耗时，亟需一种能有效利用大规模无标签数据的方法。

Method: DPGNet采用文本引导的跨域对齐和课程驱动的伪标签生成模块，结合跨域知识蒸馏避免灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在11个数据集上，DPGNet比现有最优方法性能提升6.3%。

Conclusion: DPGNet通过利用无标签数据和跨域对齐，有效解决了深度伪造检测中的标注挑战。

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods heavily depend on labeled training data.
However, as AI-generated content becomes increasingly realistic, even
\textbf{human annotators struggle to distinguish} between deepfakes and
authentic images. This makes the labeling process both time-consuming and less
reliable. Specifically, there is a growing demand for approaches that can
effectively utilize large-scale unlabeled data from online social networks.
Unlike typical unsupervised learning tasks, where categories are distinct,
AI-generated faces closely mimic real image distributions and share strong
similarities, causing performance drop in conventional strategies. In this
paper, we introduce the Dual-Path Guidance Network (DPGNet), to tackle two key
challenges: (1) bridging the domain gap between faces from different generation
models, and (2) utilizing unlabeled image samples. The method features two core
modules: text-guided cross-domain alignment, which uses learnable prompts to
unify visual and textual embeddings into a domain-invariant feature space, and
curriculum-driven pseudo label generation, which dynamically exploit more
informative unlabeled samples. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we also
facilitate bridging between domains via cross-domain knowledge distillation.
Extensive experiments on \textbf{11 popular datasets}, show that DPGNet
outperforms SoTA approaches by \textbf{6.3\%}, highlighting its effectiveness
in leveraging unlabeled data to address the annotation challenges posed by the
increasing realism of deepfakes.

Result: 在SimplerEnv实验中，任务解决率比SpatialVLA提高了4%，比TraceVLA提高了19%。

Conclusion: 该方法能以少量训练数据实现性能提升，适用于数据收集困难的现实场景。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
predicting agent movements within virtual environments and real-world scenarios
based on visual observations and textual instructions. Although recent research
has focused on enhancing spatial and temporal understanding independently, this
paper presents a novel approach that integrates both aspects through visual
prompting. We introduce a method that projects visual traces of key points from
observations onto depth maps, enabling models to capture both spatial and
temporal information simultaneously. The experiments in SimplerEnv show that
the mean number of tasks successfully solved increased for 4% compared to
SpatialVLA and 19% compared to TraceVLA. Furthermore, we show that this
enhancement can be achieved with minimal training data, making it particularly
valuable for real-world applications where data collection is challenging. The

Abstract: Visual concept learning, also known as Text-to-image personalization, is the
process of teaching new concepts to a pretrained model. This has numerous
applications from product placement to entertainment and personalized design.
Here we show that many existing methods can be substantially augmented by
adding a personalization step that is (1) specific to the prompt and noise
seed, and (2) using two loss terms based on the self- and cross- attention,
capturing the identity of the personalized concept. Specifically, we leverage
PDM features -- previously designed to capture identity -- and show how they
can be used to improve personalized semantic similarity. We evaluate the
benefit that our method gains on top of six different personalization methods,
and several base text-to-image models (both UNet- and DiT-based). We find
significant improvements even over previous per-query personalization methods.

Result: 在模拟真实场景中，该方法达到68.91的EBI（Q3），显著提升了动态环境下的检测效果。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了动态环境中的视频异常检测问题，提升了实际应用中的适应性和准确性。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) can play a key role in spotting unusual
activities in video footage. VAD is difficult to use in real-world settings due
to the dynamic nature of human actions, environmental variations, and domain
shifts. Traditional evaluation metrics often prove inadequate for such
scenarios, as they rely on static assumptions and fall short of identifying a
threshold that distinguishes normal from anomalous behavior in dynamic
settings. To address this, we introduce an active learning framework tailored
for VAD, designed for adapting to the ever-changing real-world conditions. Our
approach leverages active learning to continuously select the most informative
data points for labeling, thereby enhancing model adaptability. A critical
innovation is the incorporation of a human-in-the-loop mechanism, which enables
the identification of actual normal and anomalous instances from
pseudo-labeling results generated by AI. This collected data allows the
framework to define an adaptive threshold tailored to different environments,
ensuring that the system remains effective as the definition of 'normal' shifts
across various settings. Implemented within a lab-based framework that
simulates real-world conditions, our approach allows rigorous testing and
refinement of VAD algorithms with a new metric. Experimental results show that
our method achieves an EBI (Error Balance Index) of 68.91 for Q3 in real-world
simulated scenarios, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and
significantly enhancing the applicability of VAD in dynamic environments.

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，感知精度提升12.8%。

Conclusion: VLM-3D通过端到端设计和联合损失，有效提升了自动驾驶场景中的3D感知能力。

Abstract: Open-set perception in complex traffic environments poses a critical
challenge for autonomous driving systems, particularly in identifying
previously unseen object categories, which is vital for ensuring safety. Visual
Language Models (VLMs), with their rich world knowledge and strong semantic
reasoning capabilities, offer new possibilities for addressing this task.
However, existing approaches typically leverage VLMs to extract visual features
and couple them with traditional object detectors, resulting in multi-stage
error propagation that hinders perception accuracy. To overcome this
limitation, we propose VLM-3D, the first end-to-end framework that enables VLMs
to perform 3D geometric perception in autonomous driving scenarios. VLM-3D
incorporates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently adapt VLMs to driving
tasks with minimal computational overhead, and introduces a joint
semantic-geometric loss design: token-level semantic loss is applied during
early training to ensure stable convergence, while 3D IoU loss is introduced in
later stages to refine the accuracy of 3D bounding box predictions. Evaluations
on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the proposed joint semantic-geometric
loss in VLM-3D leads to a 12.8% improvement in perception accuracy, fully
validating the effectiveness and advancement of our method.

Conclusion: 该研究为大规模压缩模型的未来探索提供了启示，并深化了对压缩与智能关系的理解。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight a strong connection
between intelligence and compression. Learned image compression, a fundamental
task in modern data compression, has made significant progress in recent years.
However, current models remain limited in scale, restricting their
representation capacity, and how scaling model size influences compression
performance remains unexplored. In this work, we present a pioneering study on
scaling up learned image compression models and revealing the performance
trends through scaling laws. Using the recent state-of-the-art HPCM model as
baseline, we scale model parameters from 68.5 millions to 1 billion and fit
power-law relations between test loss and key scaling variables, including
model size and optimal training compute. The results reveal a scaling trend,
enabling extrapolation to larger scale models. Experimental results demonstrate
that the scaled-up HPCM-1B model achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion
performance. We hope this work inspires future exploration of large-scale
compression models and deeper investigations into the connection between
compression and intelligence.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于对比学习的无监督去偏方法，用于减少视觉语言模型在青光眼筛查中的群体差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现优异，但仍存在隐性的人口统计偏差，尤其在青光眼筛查等关键应用中，这种偏差可能对弱势群体造成不公。

Method: 通过无监督聚类推断代理子群，计算梯度相似性权重，并在联合目标函数中加权以提升表现较差的子群。

Result: 在哈佛FairVLMed青光眼子集上，通过EOD、ES AUC和Groupwise AUC等指标验证了方法的公平性。

Conclusion: 该方法无需标签即可自适应地减少子群差异，为公平的多模态学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success on multimodal
tasks such as image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification, yet they can
exhibit demographic biases even when explicit protected attributes are absent
during training. In this work, we focus on automated glaucoma screening from
retinal fundus images, a critical application given that glaucoma is a leading
cause of irreversible blindness and disproportionately affects underserved
populations. Building on a reweighting-based contrastive learning framework, we
introduce an attribute-agnostic debiasing method that (i) infers proxy
subgroups via unsupervised clustering of image-image embeddings, (ii) computes
gradient-similarity weights between the CLIP-style multimodal loss and a
SimCLR-style image-pair contrastive loss, and (iii) applies these weights in a
joint, top-$k$ weighted objective to upweight underperforming clusters. This
label-free approach adaptively targets the hardest examples, thereby reducing
subgroup disparities. We evaluate our method on the Harvard FairVLMed glaucoma
subset, reporting Equalized Odds Distance (EOD), Equalized Subgroup AUC (ES
AUC), and Groupwise AUC to demonstrate equitable performance across inferred
demographic subgroups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生物特征认证系统（如人脸识别）容易受到深度伪造等高级攻击，现有活体检测技术无法有效应对。

Method: 研究提出了一种新型深度学习模型，结合纹理分析和反射特性，以区分真实与伪造生物特征。

Result: 在五个数据集上的测试表明，最佳模型（AttackNet V2.2）平均准确率达99.9%，显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提升了生物特征认证的安全性，还为理解伪造攻击的行为模式提供了新视角。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital security, biometric
authentication systems, particularly facial recognition, have emerged as
integral components of various security protocols. However, the reliability of
these systems is compromised by sophisticated spoofing attacks, where imposters
gain unauthorized access by falsifying biometric traits. Current literature
reveals a concerning gap: existing liveness detection methodologies - designed
to counteract these breaches - fall short against advanced spoofing tactics
employing deepfakes and other artificial intelligence-driven manipulations.
This study introduces a robust solution through novel deep learning models
addressing the deficiencies in contemporary anti-spoofing techniques. By
innovatively integrating texture analysis and reflective properties associated
with genuine human traits, our models distinguish authentic presence from
replicas with remarkable precision. Extensive evaluations were conducted across
five diverse datasets, encompassing a wide range of attack vectors and
environmental conditions. Results demonstrate substantial advancement over
existing systems, with our best model (AttackNet V2.2) achieving 99.9% average
accuracy when trained on combined data. Moreover, our research unveils critical
insights into the behavioral patterns of impostor attacks, contributing to a
more nuanced understanding of their evolving nature. The implications are
profound: our models do not merely fortify the authentication processes but
also instill confidence in biometric systems across various sectors reliant on
secure access.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动设备上部署大型生成AI模型需求增长，但现有视频VAE因参数大和内核不匹配导致内存不足或推理缓慢。

Method: 分析现有VAE冗余，引入3D深度可分离卷积减少参数；提出解耦3D像素洗牌方案降低延迟；仅训练解码器并通过蒸馏快速适配移动设备。

Result: Turbo-VAED在GPU上加速原始VAE达84.5倍，参数减少至17.5%，保留96.9%重建质量；在iPhone 16 Pro上FPS提升2.9倍且质量更优。

Conclusion: Turbo-VAED是一种通用、高效的移动端视频VAE解码方案，显著提升性能并降低部署成本。

Abstract: There is a growing demand for deploying large generative AI models on mobile
devices. For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational
AutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both
large parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or
extremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a
low-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile
devices. (1) We analyze redundancy in existing VAE architectures and get
empirical design insights. By integrating 3D depthwise separable convolutions
into our model, we significantly reduce the number of parameters. (2) We
observe that the upsampling techniques in mainstream video VAEs are poorly
suited to mobile hardware and form the main bottleneck. In response, we propose
a decoupled 3D pixel shuffle scheme that slashes end-to-end delay. Building
upon these, we develop a universal mobile-oriented VAE decoder, Turbo-VAED. (3)
We propose an efficient VAE decoder training method. Since only the decoder is
used during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the
full VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our
knowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile
devices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video
VAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as
low as $95, it accelerates original VAEs by up to 84.5x at 720p resolution on
GPUs, uses as low as 17.5% of original parameter count, and retains 96.9% of
the original reconstruction quality. Compared to mobile-optimized VAEs,
Turbo-VAED achieves a 2.9x speedup in FPS and better reconstruction quality on
the iPhone 16 Pro. The code and models will soon be available at
https://github.com/hustvl/Turbo-VAED.

Abstract: Simultaneous relighting and novel-view rendering of digital human
representations is an important yet challenging task with numerous
applications. Progress in this area has been significantly limited due to the
lack of publicly available, high-quality datasets, especially for full-body
human captures. To address this critical gap, we introduce the HumanOLAT
dataset, the first publicly accessible large-scale dataset of multi-view
One-Light-at-a-Time (OLAT) captures of full-body humans. The dataset includes
HDR RGB frames under various illuminations, such as white light, environment
maps, color gradients and fine-grained OLAT illuminations. Our evaluations of
state-of-the-art relighting and novel-view synthesis methods underscore both
the dataset's value and the significant challenges still present in modeling
complex human-centric appearance and lighting interactions. We believe
HumanOLAT will significantly facilitate future research, enabling rigorous
benchmarking and advancements in both general and human-specific relighting and
rendering techniques.

### [135] [Topos Theory for Generative AI and LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08293)
*Sridhar Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于拓扑理论的新型生成AI架构（GAIAs），利用范畴论中的通用构造构建LLM的新组合结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM研究多关注线性架构或专家混合模型，而本文旨在利用范畴论中的拓扑性质探索更丰富的组合结构。

Method: 利用范畴论中的通用性质（如拉回、推出、指数对象等）构建LLM的新架构，并通过理论验证其完备性和拓扑性质。

Result: 证明了LLM范畴是完备的，并形成一个拓扑（类似集合的范畴），为新型架构提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 通过范畴论的工具，为LLM设计提供了新的理论框架和实现路径。

Abstract: We propose the design of novel categorical generative AI architectures
(GAIAs) using topos theory, a type of category that is ``set-like": a topos has
all (co)limits, is Cartesian closed, and has a subobject classifier. Previous
theoretical results on the Transformer model have shown that it is a universal
sequence-to-sequence function approximator, and dense in the space of all
continuous functions with compact support on the Euclidean space of embeddings
of tokens. Building on this theoretical result, we explore novel architectures
for LLMs that exploit the property that the category of LLMs, viewed as
functions, forms a topos. Previous studies of large language models (LLMs) have
focused on daisy-chained linear architectures or mixture-of-experts. In this
paper, we use universal constructions in category theory to construct novel LLM
architectures based on new types of compositional structures. In particular,
these new compositional structures are derived from universal properties of LLM
categories, and include pullback, pushout, (co) equalizers, exponential
objects, and subobject classifiers. We theoretically validate these new
compositional structures by showing that the category of LLMs is (co)complete,
meaning that all diagrams have solutions in the form of (co)limits. Building on
this completeness result, we then show that the category of LLMs forms a topos,
a ``set-like" category, which requires showing the existence of exponential
objects as well as subobject classifiers. We use a functorial characterization
of backpropagation to define a potential implementation of an LLM topos
architecture.

### [136] [Topos Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08295)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型因果模型——拓扑因果模型（TCMs），利用拓扑范畴的关键性质（如完备性、子对象分类器和指数对象），展示了这些性质在因果推断中的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过拓扑范畴的性质（如子对象分类器、极限和余极限、指数对象）为因果推断提供更强大的数学工具，解决复杂因果图的建模和近似问题。

Method: 定义TCMs为一组函数，每个函数定义局部因果机制，组合成全局函数。证明TCMs范畴的完备性，利用极限和余极限求解因果图，子对象分类器建模干预，指数对象处理等价类。

Result: 证明了TCMs范畴的完备性，展示了如何用极限和余极限求解因果图，子对象分类器建模干预，指数对象处理等价类，并提供了内部逻辑工具。

Conclusion: TCMs为因果推断提供了强大的数学框架，能够处理复杂因果图的建模、干预和等价类问题，并支持内部逻辑推理。

Abstract: We propose topos causal models (TCMs), a novel class of causal models that
exploit the key properties of a topos category: they are (co)complete, meaning
all (co)limits exist, they admit a subobject classifier, and allow exponential
objects. The main goal of this paper is to show that these properties are
central to many applications in causal inference. For example, subobject
classifiers allow a categorical formulation of causal intervention, which
creates sub-models. Limits and colimits allow causal diagrams of arbitrary
complexity to be ``solved", using a novel interpretation of causal
approximation. Exponential objects enable reasoning about equivalence classes
of operations on causal models, such as covered edge reversal and causal
homotopy. Analogous to structural causal models (SCMs), TCMs are defined by a
collection of functions, each defining a ``local autonomous" causal mechanism
that assemble to induce a unique global function from exogenous to endogenous
variables. Since the category of TCMs is (co)complete, which we prove in this
paper, every causal diagram has a ``solution" in the form of a (co)limit: this
implies that any arbitrary causal model can be ``approximated" by some global
function with respect to the morphisms going into or out of the diagram.
Natural transformations are crucial in measuring the quality of approximation.
In addition, we show that causal interventions are modeled by subobject
classifiers: any sub-model is defined by a monic arrow into its parent model.
Exponential objects permit reasoning about entire classes of causal
equivalences and interventions. Finally, as TCMs form a topos, they admit an
internal logic defined as a Mitchell-Benabou language with an associated
Kripke-Joyal semantics. We show how to reason about causal models in TCMs using
this internal logic.

Motivation: 解决高度约束多目标问题中难以快速获得高质量近似解集的挑战。

Result: 在多目标车辆路径问题基准测试中，方法在短时间内生成高质量解。

Conclusion: 结合多目标算法和目标规划，能高效解决具有相似适应度景观的问题实例。

Abstract: Many real-world applications require decision-makers to assess the quality of
solutions while considering multiple conflicting objectives. Obtaining good
approximation sets for highly constrained many-objective problems is often a
difficult task even for modern multiobjective algorithms. In some cases,
multiple instances of the problem scenario present similarities in their
fitness landscapes. That is, there are recurring features in the fitness
landscapes when searching for solutions to different problem instances. We
propose a methodology to exploit this characteristic by solving one instance of
a given problem scenario using computationally expensive multiobjective
algorithms to obtain a good approximation set and then using Goal Programming
with efficient single-objective algorithms to solve other instances of the same
problem scenario. We use three goal-based objective functions and show that on
benchmark instances of the multiobjective vehicle routing problem with time
windows, the methodology is able to produce good results in short computation
time. The methodology allows to combine the effectiveness of state-of-the-art
multiobjective algorithms with the efficiency of goal programming to find good
compromise solutions in problem scenarios where instances have similar fitness
landscapes.

Conclusion: LLM可以自动化贝叶斯建模的关键步骤，为概率编程的自动化推断流程提供了可能。

Abstract: A significant barrier to the widespread adoption of Bayesian inference is the
specification of prior distributions and likelihoods, which often requires
specialized statistical expertise. This paper investigates the feasibility of
using a Large Language Model (LLM) to automate this process. We introduce
LLM-BI (Large Language Model-driven Bayesian Inference), a conceptual pipeline
for automating Bayesian workflows. As a proof-of-concept, we present two
experiments focused on Bayesian linear regression. In Experiment I, we
demonstrate that an LLM can successfully elicit prior distributions from
natural language. In Experiment II, we show that an LLM can specify the entire
model structure, including both priors and the likelihood, from a single
high-level problem description. Our results validate the potential of LLMs to
automate key steps in Bayesian modeling, enabling the possibility of an
automated inference pipeline for probabilistic programming.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FATA的新交互范式，通过引导LLMs主动生成多维补充问题，显著提升了回答质量和相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在用户提供信息不完整或模糊时回答不准确的问题。

Method: 采用FATA范式，通过提示词引导LLMs生成补充问题，整合用户反馈后生成回答。

Result: FATA在综合指标上优于基线提示40%，且稳定性更高。

Conclusion: FATA通过用户参与和单轮策略，显著提升了LLMs的回答质量和效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to deliver accurate and
actionable answers when user-provided information is incomplete or
ill-specified. We propose a new interaction paradigm, First Ask Then Answer
(FATA), in which, through prompt words, LLMs are guided to proactively generate
multidimensional supplementary questions for users prior to response
generation. Subsequently, by integrating user-provided supplementary
information with the original query through sophisticated prompting techniques,
we achieve substantially improved response quality and relevance. In contrast
to existing clarification approaches -- such as the CLAM framework oriented to
ambiguity and the self-interrogation Self-Ask method -- FATA emphasizes
completeness (beyond mere disambiguation) and user participation (inviting
human input instead of relying solely on model-internal reasoning). It also
adopts a single-turn strategy: all clarifying questions are produced at once,
thereby reducing dialogue length and improving efficiency. Conceptually, FATA
uses the reasoning power of LLMs to scaffold user expression, enabling
non-expert users to formulate more comprehensive and contextually relevant
queries. To evaluate FATA, we constructed a multi-domain benchmark and compared
it with two controls: a baseline prompt (B-Prompt) and a context-enhanced
expert prompt (C-Prompt). Experimental results show that FATA outperforms
B-Prompt by approximately 40% in aggregate metrics and exhibits a coefficient
of variation 8% lower than C-Prompt, indicating superior stability.

Motivation: 现有KG-RAG评估方法存在不足，无法区分模型是推理还是直接检索答案，且评估指标不一致。

Method: 提出了一种构建基准和评估协议的方法，系统评估知识缺失下的KG-RAG方法。

Result: 当前KG-RAG方法在知识缺失时推理能力有限，依赖记忆，泛化能力因设计而异。

Conclusion: 需要改进KG-RAG方法以提升其在知识缺失时的推理能力和泛化性。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is an
increasingly explored approach for combining the reasoning capabilities of
large language models with the structured evidence of knowledge graphs.
However, current evaluation practices fall short: existing benchmarks often
include questions that can be directly answered using existing triples in KG,
making it unclear whether models perform reasoning or simply retrieve answers
directly. Moreover, inconsistent evaluation metrics and lenient answer matching
criteria further obscure meaningful comparisons. In this work, we introduce a
general method for constructing benchmarks, together with an evaluation
protocol, to systematically assess KG-RAG methods under knowledge
incompleteness. Our empirical results show that current KG-RAG methods have
limited reasoning ability under missing knowledge, often rely on internal
memorization, and exhibit varying degrees of generalization depending on their
design.

Motivation: 收集式卡牌游戏（CCGs）因部分可观察性、长期决策和卡牌库变化，现有AI表现远不如人类玩家。

Method: 使用低秩适应（LoRA）微调开源的LLM，基于标注的选牌日志数据集，快速适应游戏的不同扩展版本。

Result: UrzaGPT在微调后达到66.2%的准确率，优于零样本LLMs（如GPT-4o的43%），但未超越领域专用模型。

Conclusion: LLMs可用于构建高效、通用且易于更新的选牌AI，未来潜力巨大。

Abstract: Collectible card games (CCGs) are a difficult genre for AI due to their
partial observability, long-term decision-making, and evolving card sets. Due
to this, current AI models perform vastly worse than human players at CCG tasks
such as deckbuilding and gameplay. In this work, we introduce UrzaGPT, a
domain-adapted large language model that recommends real-time drafting
decisions in Magic: The Gathering. Starting from an open-weight LLM, we use
Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning on a dataset of annotated draft logs. With
this, we leverage the language modeling capabilities of LLM, and can quickly
adapt to different expansions of the game. We benchmark UrzaGPT in comparison
to zero-shot LLMs and the state-of-the-art domain-specific model. Untuned,
small LLMs like Llama-3-8B are completely unable to draft, but the larger
GPT-4o achieves a zero-shot performance of 43%. Using UrzaGPT to fine-tune
smaller models, we achieve an accuracy of 66.2% using only 10,000 steps.
Despite this not reaching the capability of domain-specific models, we show
that solely using LLMs to draft is possible and conclude that using LLMs can
enable performant, general, and update-friendly drafting AIs in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCTS在经典规划中节点选择时间过长，尤其是搜索深度d较大时，传统树状OPEN列表的O(log N)复杂度成为瓶颈。

Method: 采用双层修改的MCTS，从每个选定的叶节点运行最佳优先搜索，并结合树折叠技术减少动作选择步骤。

Result: 实现了节点选择的O(1)时间复杂度，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了MCTS在经典规划中的性能瓶颈，为大规模问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We study an efficient implementation of Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)-based
Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for classical planning. One weakness of MCTS is
that it spends a significant time deciding which node to expand next. While
selecting a node from an OPEN list with $N$ nodes has $O(1)$ runtime complexity
with traditional array-based priority-queues for dense integer keys, the
tree-based OPEN list used by MCTS requires $O(\log N)$, which roughly
corresponds to the search depth $d$. In classical planning, $d$ is arbitrarily
large (e.g., $2^k-1$ in $k$-disk Tower-of-Hanoi) and the runtime for node
selection is significant, unlike in game tree search, where the cost is
negligible compared to the node evaluation (rollouts) because $d$ is inherently
limited by the game (e.g., $d\leq 361$ in Go). To improve this bottleneck, we
propose a bilevel modification to MCTS that runs a best-first search from each
selected leaf node with an expansion budget proportional to $d$, which achieves
amortized $O(1)$ runtime for node selection, equivalent to the traditional
queue-based OPEN list. In addition, we introduce Tree Collapsing, an
enhancement that reduces action selection steps and further improves the
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在编译约束建模语言时，会生成所有组合并通过部分评估丢弃无用项，这在大多数组合无关的问题中效率低下。

Method: 使用求解器仅计算生成最终约束所需的组合，避免完全枚举。

Result: 生成的模型与传统方法相同，但编译速度显著提升，尤其适用于大域和选择性前提条件的情况。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了将高级用户模型转换为求解器就绪形式的效率。

Abstract: Constraint modelling languages like MiniZinc and Essence rely on unrolling
loops (in the form of quantified expressions and comprehensions) during
compilation. Standard approaches generate all combinations of induction
variables and use partial evaluation to discard those that simplify to identity
elements of associative-commutative operators (e.g. true for conjunction, 0 for
summation). This can be inefficient for problems where most combinations are
ultimately irrelevant. We present a method that avoids full enumeration by
using a solver to compute only the combinations required to generate the final
set of constraints. The resulting model is identical to that produced by
conventional flattening, but compilation can be significantly faster. This
improves the efficiency of translating high-level user models into solver-ready
form, particularly when induction variables range over large domains with
selective preconditions.

TL;DR: OverFill通过解耦预填充和解码阶段优化LLM推理效率，提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）推理成本高，解码阶段延迟显著，现有模型未区分预填充和解码的计算特性。

Method: 提出OverFill，预填充阶段使用完整模型并行处理输入，解码阶段切换为密集剪枝模型顺序生成令牌。

Result: 3B到1B的OverFill配置比1B剪枝模型性能提升83.2%，8B到3B配置比3B剪枝模型提升79.2%。

Conclusion: OverFill在相同规模模型上性能相当，但训练数据需求显著减少。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across diverse tasks but face significant
deployment challenges due to high inference costs. LLM inference comprises
prefill (compute-bound) and decode (memory-bound) stages, with decode
dominating latency particularly for long sequences. Current decoder-only models
handle both stages uniformly, despite their distinct computational profiles. We
propose OverFill, which decouples these stages to optimize accuracy-efficiency
tradeoffs. OverFill begins with a full model for prefill, processing system and
user inputs in parallel. It then switches to a dense pruned model, while
generating tokens sequentially. Leveraging more compute during prefill,
OverFill improves generation quality with minimal latency overhead. Our
3B-to-1B OverFill configuration outperforms 1B pruned models by 83.2%, while
the 8B-to-3B configuration improves over 3B pruned models by 79.2% on average
across standard benchmarks. OverFill matches the performance of same-sized
models trained from scratch, while using significantly less training data. Our
code is available at https://github.com/friendshipkim/overfill.

Abstract: The Trigger Arc Traveling Salesman Problem (TA-TSP) extends the classical TSP
by introducing dynamic arc costs that change when specific \textit{trigger}
arcs are traversed, modeling scenarios such as warehouse operations with
compactable storage systems. This paper introduces a GRASP-based metaheuristic
that combines multiple construction heuristics with a multi-neighborhood local
search. The construction phase uses mixed-integer programming (MIP) techniques
to transform the TA-TSP into a sequence of tailored TSP instances, while the
improvement phase applies 2-Opt, Swap, and Relocate operators. Computational
experiments on MESS 2024 competition instances achieved average optimality gaps
of 0.77\% and 0.40\% relative to the best-known solutions within a 60-second
limit. On smaller, synthetically generated datasets, the method produced
solutions 11.3\% better than the Gurobi solver under the same time constraints.
The algorithm finished in the top three at MESS 2024, demonstrating its
suitability for real-time routing applications with state-dependent travel
costs.

### [146] [Beyond Ordinal Preferences: Why Alignment Needs Cardinal Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08486)
*Parker Whitfill,Stewy Slocum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文指出，基于序数比较的LLM对齐方法存在根本性限制，无法系统性地恢复最优模型。作者提出使用基数反馈（如支付意愿）来改进偏好微调，并发布了一个包含25,000条基数判断的数据集。实验表明，该方法优于仅依赖序数的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM对齐技术依赖序数偏好数据（如二元选择），但这类数据无法解决模型间的权衡问题（如事实错误与风格改进）。作者希望通过基数反馈（如支付意愿）更准确地识别模型偏好。

Method: 作者收集并公开了一个包含25,000条基数判断的数据集，使用支付意愿作为基数反馈工具。将基数反馈纳入偏好微调过程，以优化模型选择。

Result: 实验结果显示，基于基数反馈的方法能更有效地优先处理高影响力改进，并在下游基准（如Arena-Hard）上优于仅依赖序数的方法。

Conclusion: 基数反馈是改进LLM对齐的关键，能够解决序数数据的局限性，提升模型优化效果。

Abstract: Alignment techniques for LLMs rely on optimizing preference-based objectives
-- where these preferences are typically elicited as ordinal, binary choices
between responses. Recent work has focused on improving label quality or
mitigating particular biases, but we identify a more fundamental limitation:
these methods collect the wrong kind of data. We prove an impossibility result:
no algorithm relying solely on ordinal comparisons can systematically recover
the most preferred model. Intuitively, ordinal data lacks the information
needed to resolve tradeoffs -- e.g., fixing a factual error on one prompt
versus improving style on another. We show that selecting the optimal model
requires recovering preferences over \emph{models} (rather than just
responses), which can only be identified given cardinal feedback about response
quality. To address this, we collect and publicly release a dataset of 25,000
cardinal judgments using willingness-to-pay elicitations, a well-established
tool from experimental economics. Empirically, we find that incorporating
cardinal feedback into preference fine-tuning allows models to prioritize
high-impact improvements and outperform ordinal-only methods on downstream
benchmarks, such as Arena-Hard.

Result: 在CVRPLIB数据集上验证，POMO+收敛更快且结果更优，适用于最多100个客户的问题实例。

Conclusion: POMO+为组合优化问题提供了更高效的解决方案，有望推动该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have emerged as a
promising approach for solving combinatorial problems. Among RL-based models,
POMO has demonstrated strong performance on a variety of tasks, including
variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). However, there is room for
improvement for these tasks. In this work, we improved POMO, creating a method
(\textbf{POMO+}) that leverages the initial nodes to find a solution in a more
informed way. We ran experiments on our new model and observed that our
solution converges faster and achieves better results. We validated our models
on the CVRPLIB dataset and noticed improvements in problem instances with up to
100 customers. We hope that our research in this project can lead to further
advancements in the field.

Motivation: 本体对齐在跨领域数据整合中至关重要，但高质量对应关系生成仍具挑战性。人工验证成本高，尤其是在处理大规模本体时。

Method: 利用LLM仅验证本体对齐系统中不确定的对应关系，通过多种本体驱动提示模板评估多个先进LLM的性能。

Result: 在多个OAEI匹配任务中评估LLM表现，并与不同错误率的模拟Oracle进行比较。

Abstract: Ontology alignment plays a crucial role in integrating diverse data sources
across domains. There is a large plethora of systems that tackle the ontology
alignment problem, yet challenges persist in producing highly quality
correspondences among a set of input ontologies. Human-in-the-loop during the
alignment process is essential in applications requiring very accurate
mappings. User involvement is, however, expensive when dealing with large
ontologies. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using Large Language
Models (LLM) as an alternative to the domain expert. The use of the LLM focuses
only on the validation of the subset of correspondences where an ontology
alignment system is very uncertain. We have conducted an extensive evaluation
over several matching tasks of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative
(OAEI), analysing the performance of several state-of-the-art LLMs using
different ontology-driven prompt templates. The LLM results are also compared
against simulated Oracles with variable error rates.

TL;DR: GVGAI-LLM是一个基于视频游戏的基准测试，用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）的推理和问题解决能力。它通过多样化的游戏场景和可扩展的游戏设计语言，测试LLM在空间推理和基础规划方面的表现，揭示了其局限性并提出了改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM基准测试多集中在语言任务上，缺乏对空间推理和规划能力的评估。GVGAI-LLM旨在填补这一空白，提供一个可扩展且多样化的测试环境。

Method: 基于General Video Game AI框架，使用ASCII字符表示游戏场景，通过游戏描述语言快速生成新游戏和关卡。定义了可解释的指标（如有效步骤比例、步骤效率等）评估模型行为。

Result: 零样本评估显示LLM在空间推理和基础规划方面存在明显不足，模型常犯空间和逻辑错误。结构化提示和空间接地技术带来部分改进，但问题仍未完全解决。

Conclusion: GVGAI-LLM为研究LLM的代理行为和上下文推理能力提供了可复现的测试平台，强调了进一步改进的必要性。

Abstract: We introduce GVGAI-LLM, a video game benchmark for evaluating the reasoning
and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Built on the
General Video Game AI framework, it features a diverse collection of
arcade-style games designed to test a model's ability to handle tasks that
differ from most existing LLM benchmarks. The benchmark leverages a game
description language that enables rapid creation of new games and levels,
helping to prevent overfitting over time. Each game scene is represented by a
compact set of ASCII characters, allowing for efficient processing by language
models. GVGAI-LLM defines interpretable metrics, including the meaningful step
ratio, step efficiency, and overall score, to assess model behavior. Through
zero-shot evaluations across a broad set of games and levels with diverse
challenges and skill depth, we reveal persistent limitations of LLMs in spatial
reasoning and basic planning. Current models consistently exhibit spatial and
logical errors, motivating structured prompting and spatial grounding
techniques. While these interventions lead to partial improvements, the
benchmark remains very far from solved. GVGAI-LLM provides a reproducible
testbed for advancing research on language model capabilities, with a
particular emphasis on agentic behavior and contextual reasoning.

TL;DR: SynLLM是一个模块化框架，利用20种开源LLM生成高质量合成医疗数据，通过结构化提示和全面评估确保数据质量与隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实医疗数据因隐私法规受限，合成数据是替代方案，但现有方法缺乏系统提示策略和全面评估框架。

Method: 提出SynLLM框架，使用20种LLM（如LLaMA、Mistral等），设计四种提示类型（如规则约束），结合统计、临床和隐私评估。

Result: 在糖尿病、肝硬化和中风数据集上测试，规则提示在隐私与质量间取得最佳平衡。

Conclusion: LLM在良好提示和评估下可生成临床合理且隐私保护的合成医疗数据，推动医疗研究数据共享。

Abstract: Access to real-world medical data is often restricted due to privacy
regulations, posing a significant barrier to the advancement of healthcare
research. Synthetic data offers a promising alternative; however, generating
realistic, clinically valid, and privacy-conscious records remains a major
challenge. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for structured data generation; however, existing approaches
frequently lack systematic prompting strategies and comprehensive,
multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks.
  In this paper, we present SynLLM, a modular framework for generating
high-quality synthetic medical tabular data using 20 state-of-the-art
open-source LLMs, including LLaMA, Mistral, and GPT variants, guided by
structured prompts. We propose four distinct prompt types, ranging from
example-driven to rule-based constraints, that encode schema, metadata, and
domain knowledge to control generation without model fine-tuning. Our framework
features a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that rigorously assesses generated
data across statistical fidelity, clinical consistency, and privacy
preservation.
  We evaluate SynLLM across three public medical datasets, including Diabetes,
Cirrhosis, and Stroke, using 20 open-source LLMs. Our results show that prompt
engineering significantly impacts data quality and privacy risk, with
rule-based prompts achieving the best privacy-quality balance. SynLLM
establishes that, when guided by well-designed prompts and evaluated with
robust, multi-metric criteria, LLMs can generate synthetic medical data that is
both clinically plausible and privacy-aware, paving the way for safer and more
effective data sharing in healthcare research.

Motivation: 传统网格移动方法计算复杂度高且几何灵活性差，现有监督学习方法难以零样本泛化。

Method: 采用无监督网格自适应和物理约束损失函数（M-Uniform loss），实现网格节点的均匀分布。

Result: 实验表明，UGM2N在多种PDE和网格几何中表现优异，具有可扩展性和无网格纠缠的误差减少。

Conclusion: UGM2N是一种高效、通用的网格自适应方法，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) form the mathematical foundation for
modeling physical systems in science and engineering, where numerical solutions
demand rigorous accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. Mesh movement techniques address
this challenge by dynamically relocating mesh nodes to rapidly-varying regions,
enhancing both simulation accuracy and computational efficiency. However,
traditional approaches suffer from high computational complexity and geometric
inflexibility, limiting their applicability, and existing supervised
learning-based approaches face challenges in zero-shot generalization across
diverse PDEs and mesh topologies.In this paper, we present an Unsupervised and
Generalizable Mesh Movement Network (UGM2N). We first introduce unsupervised
mesh adaptation through localized geometric feature learning, eliminating the
dependency on pre-adapted meshes. We then develop a physics-constrained loss
function, M-Uniform loss, that enforces mesh equidistribution at the nodal
level.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network exhibits
equation-agnostic generalization and geometric independence in efficient mesh
adaptation. It demonstrates consistent superiority over existing methods,
including robust performance across diverse PDEs and mesh geometries,
scalability to multi-scale resolutions and guaranteed error reduction without
mesh tangling.

Conclusion: AgriGPT为农业提供了一个模块化、可扩展的LLM生态系统，并推广了科学和行业专用LLM的开发框架。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), their application
in agriculture remains limited due to the lack of domain-specific models,
curated datasets, and robust evaluation frameworks. To address these
challenges, we propose AgriGPT, a domain-specialized LLM ecosystem for
agricultural usage. At its core, we design a multi-agent scalable data engine
that systematically compiles credible data sources into Agri-342K, a
high-quality, standardized question-answer (QA) dataset. Trained on this
dataset, AgriGPT supports a broad range of agricultural stakeholders, from
practitioners to policy-makers. To enhance factual grounding, we employ
Tri-RAG, a three-channel Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework combining
dense retrieval, sparse retrieval, and multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning,
thereby improving the LLM's reasoning reliability. For comprehensive
evaluation, we introduce AgriBench-13K, a benchmark suite comprising 13 tasks
with varying types and complexities. Experiments demonstrate that AgriGPT
significantly outperforms general-purpose LLMs on both domain adaptation and
reasoning. Beyond the model itself, AgriGPT represents a modular and extensible
LLM ecosystem for agriculture, comprising structured data construction,
retrieval-enhanced generation, and domain-specific evaluation. This work
provides a generalizable framework for developing scientific and
industry-specialized LLMs. All models, datasets, and code will be released to
empower agricultural communities, especially in underserved regions, and to
promote open, impactful research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种称为“diminution”的方法，通过选择Herbrand宇宙的子集来减少ASP中的基础程序规模，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASP常因基础程序规模过大而遇到性能瓶颈，现有方法多依赖临时启发式策略，缺乏通用性。

Method: 引入diminution概念，定义其形式化属性，并通过特定编码利用现有ASP求解器评估候选子集。

Result: 实验显示，该方法平均减少70%的基础时间，基础文件大小减少85%。

Conclusion: diminution是一种通用且有效的方法，可显著缓解ASP中的基础瓶颈。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is often hindered by the grounding bottleneck:
large Herbrand universes generate ground programs so large that solving becomes
difficult. Many methods employ ad-hoc heuristics to improve grounding
performance, motivating the need for a more formal and generalizable strategy.
We introduce the notion of diminution, defined as a selected subset of the
Herbrand universe used to generate a reduced ground program before solving. We
give a formal definition of diminution, analyze its key properties, and study
the complexity of identifying it. We use a specific encoding that enables
off-the-shelf ASP solver to evaluate candidate subsets. Our approach integrates
seamlessly with existing grounders via domain predicates. In extensive
experiments on five benchmarks, applying diminutions selected by our strategy
yields significant performance improvements, reducing grounding time by up to
70% on average and decreasing the size of grounding files by up to 85%. These
results demonstrate that leveraging diminutions constitutes a robust and
general-purpose approach for alleviating the grounding bottleneck in ASP.

Motivation: EHR数据复杂且多模态，传统特征选择方法难以应对其稀疏性和异质性，尤其是在考虑患者个体差异和特征成本时。

Method: 开发了一种在线获取特征的个性化框架，结合预算限制和特征可变性成本，适用于稀疏和多模态数据。

Result: 该框架在多样化医疗场景中表现出稳健且可扩展的性能，支持医生在预算内逐步获取最具信息量的特征。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了诊断信心并优化了资源利用，为EHR数据分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) have revolutionized healthcare by digitizing
patient data, improving accessibility, and streamlining clinical workflows.
However, extracting meaningful insights from these complex and multimodal
datasets remains a significant challenge for researchers. Traditional feature
selection methods often struggle with the inherent sparsity and heterogeneity
of EHR data, especially when accounting for patient-specific variations and
feature costs in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel personalized, online and cost-aware feature selection framework
tailored specifically for EHR datasets. The features are aquired in an online
fashion for individual patients, incorporating budgetary constraints and
feature variability costs. The framework is designed to effectively manage
sparse and multimodal data, ensuring robust and scalable performance in diverse
healthcare contexts. A primary application of our proposed method is to support
physicians' decision making in patient screening scenarios. By guiding
physicians toward incremental acquisition of the most informative features
within budget constraints, our approach aims to increase diagnostic confidence
while optimizing resource utilization.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了LLMs在增强训练环境中的反馈、自动评估和简报方面的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of procedural communication compliance is essential in
simulation-based training, particularly in safety-critical domains where
adherence to compliance checklists reflects operational competence. This paper
explores a lightweight, deployable approach using prompt-based inference with
open-source large language models (LLMs) that can run efficiently on
consumer-grade GPUs. We present Prompt-and-Check, a method that uses
context-rich prompts to evaluate whether each checklist item in a protocol has
been fulfilled, solely based on transcribed verbal exchanges. We perform a case
study in the maritime domain with participants performing an identical
simulation task, and experiment with models such as LLama 2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B and
Mistral 7B, running locally on an RTX 4070 GPU. For each checklist item, a
prompt incorporating relevant transcript excerpts is fed into the model, which
outputs a compliance judgment. We assess model outputs against expert-annotated
ground truth using classification accuracy and agreement scores. Our findings
demonstrate that prompting enables effective context-aware reasoning without
task-specific training. This study highlights the practical utility of LLMs in
augmenting debriefing, performance feedback, and automated assessment in
training environments.

Abstract: In this research, we propose an iterative learning hybrid optimization solver

integrates the proposed Node-Destroyer Model, a machine learning hybrid model
that utilized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) such identifies and selects customer
nodes to guide the Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) operator within the
metaheuristic optimization frameworks. This model leverages the structural
properties of the problem and solution that can be represented as a graph, to
guide strategic selections concerning node removal. The proposed approach
reduces operational complexity and scales down the search space involved in the
optimization process. The hybrid approach is applied specifically to the CVRP
and does not require retraining across problem instances of different sizes.
The proposed hybrid mechanism is able to improve the performance of baseline
metaheuristic algorithms. Our approach not only enhances the solution quality
for standard CVRP benchmarks but also proves scalability on very large-scale
instances with up to 30,000 customer nodes. Experimental evaluations on
benchmark datasets show that the proposed hybrid mechanism is capable of
improving different baseline algorithms, achieving better quality of solutions

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在复杂多模态任务中表现不佳，且输出冗长，主要依赖链式思维（CoT）推理，而其他拓扑结构（如树或图）可能更有效。

Method: 提出STELAR-Vision框架，结合TopoAug数据管道（生成多样拓扑结构数据）和Frugal Learning（减少输出长度），通过监督微调和强化学习优化Qwen2VL模型。

Result: 在MATH-V和VLM-S2H上，准确率提升9.7%；在五个OOD基准测试中，优于Phi-4和LLaMA-3.2模型，最高提升28.4%。

Conclusion: STELAR-Vision通过拓扑感知推理和高效学习策略，显著提升了多模态任务的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning, yet
they often struggle with complex multimodal tasks and tend to generate overly
verbose outputs. A key limitation is their reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, despite many tasks benefiting from alternative topologies like trees
or graphs. To address this, we introduce STELAR-Vision, a training framework
for topology-aware reasoning. At its core is TopoAug, a synthetic data pipeline
that enriches training with diverse topological structures. Using supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, we post-train Qwen2VL models with both
accuracy and efficiency in mind. Additionally, we propose Frugal Learning,
which reduces output length with minimal accuracy loss. On MATH-V and VLM-S2H,
STELAR-Vision improves accuracy by 9.7% over its base model and surpasses the
larger Qwen2VL-72B-Instruct by 7.3%. On five out-of-distribution benchmarks, it
outperforms Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct by up to 28.4% and
LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct by up to 13.2%, demonstrating strong
generalization. Compared to Chain-Only training, our approach achieves 4.3%
higher overall accuracy on in-distribution datasets and consistently
outperforms across all OOD benchmarks. We have released datasets, and code will
be available.

Motivation: 现有社交代理多为场景定制，缺乏统一框架，限制了其泛化能力和行为一致性。

Method: 基于社会认知理论，提出包含动机、行动规划和学习三个模块的框架。

Result: 实验表明，该框架代理的行为与真实数据偏差降低75%，模块消融研究显示各模块对行为真实性的贡献显著。

Conclusion: 理论驱动的框架能有效提升LLM社交代理的行为真实性和适应性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated strong reasoning
and role-playing capabilities, opening new opportunities for agent-based social
simulations. However, most existing agents' implementations are
scenario-tailored, without a unified framework to guide the design. This lack
of a general social agent limits their ability to generalize across different
social contexts and to produce consistent, realistic behaviors. To address this
challenge, we propose a theory-informed framework that provides a systematic
design process for LLM-based social agents. Our framework is grounded in
principles from Social Cognition Theory and introduces three key modules:
motivation, action planning, and learning. These modules jointly enable agents
to reason about their goals, plan coherent actions, and adapt their behavior
over time, leading to more flexible and contextually appropriate responses.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our theory-driven agents reproduce
realistic human behavior patterns under complex conditions, achieving up to 75%
lower deviation from real-world behavioral data across multiple fidelity
metrics compared to classical generative baselines. Ablation studies further
show that removing motivation, planning, or learning modules increases errors
by 1.5 to 3.2 times, confirming their distinct and essential contributions to

### [160] [Designing Memory-Augmented AR Agents for Spatiotemporal Reasoning in Personalized Task Assistance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08774)
*Dongwook Choi,Taeyoon Kwon,Dongil Yang,Hyojun Kim,Jinyoung Yeo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于记忆增强的AR代理框架，通过学习和适应用户长期经验，解决现有AR代理在复杂多步骤场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AR代理在复杂多步骤任务中表现不佳，无法利用用户长期经验和偏好，因此需要一种能够存储和推理历史交互的解决方案。

Method: 框架包含四个模块：感知模块、记忆模块、时空推理模块和执行模块，旨在实现个性化任务辅助。

Result: 提出了一个概念性框架，并提供了实现路线图、评估策略和潜在应用案例。

Conclusion: 该框架为未来开发更智能的AR系统提供了方向，能够结合用户交互历史实现自适应任务辅助。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems are increasingly integrating foundation
models, such as Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), to provide more
context-aware and adaptive user experiences. This integration has led to the
development of AR agents to support intelligent, goal-directed interactions in
real-world environments. While current AR agents effectively support immediate
tasks, they struggle with complex multi-step scenarios that require
understanding and leveraging user's long-term experiences and preferences. This
limitation stems from their inability to capture, retain, and reason over
historical user interactions in spatiotemporal contexts. To address these
challenges, we propose a conceptual framework for memory-augmented AR agents
that can provide personalized task assistance by learning from and adapting to
user-specific experiences over time. Our framework consists of four
interconnected modules: (1) Perception Module for multimodal sensor processing,
(2) Memory Module for persistent spatiotemporal experience storage, (3)
Spatiotemporal Reasoning Module for synthesizing past and present contexts, and
(4) Actuator Module for effective AR communication. We further present an
implementation roadmap, a future evaluation strategy, a potential target
application and use cases to demonstrate the practical applicability of our
framework across diverse domains. We aim for this work to motivate future
research toward developing more intelligent AR systems that can effectively
bridge user's interaction history with adaptive, context-aware task assistance.

*Amir Mohammad Salehoof,Ali Ramezani,Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh,Majid Nili Ahmadabadi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于功能的知识编辑分类法，补充了现有机制导向的研究，分析了不同知识类型的编辑效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型（LLMs）的知识可能过时或不准确，而重新训练成本高昂，知识编辑成为一种高效替代方案。现有研究多关注编辑机制，忽略了知识功能的作用。

Method: 引入功能导向的分类法，结合知识类型（事实、时间、概念、常识、社会）和编辑机制，全面分析编辑效果。

Result: 通过双轴分类法梳理了当前研究现状，总结了现有方法的优缺点，并提出了评估任务和数据集。

Conclusion: 论文为知识编辑领域提供了更全面的视角，指出了未来研究方向与挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire vast knowledge from large text corpora,
but this information can become outdated or inaccurate. Since retraining is
computationally expensive, knowledge editing offers an efficient alternative --
modifying internal knowledge without full retraining. These methods aim to
update facts precisely while preserving the model's overall capabilities. While
existing surveys focus on the mechanism of editing (e.g., parameter changes vs.
external memory), they often overlook the function of the knowledge being
edited. This survey introduces a novel, complementary function-based taxonomy
to provide a more holistic view. We examine how different mechanisms apply to
various knowledge types -- factual, temporal, conceptual, commonsense, and
social -- highlighting how editing effectiveness depends on the nature of the
target knowledge. By organizing our review along these two axes, we map the
current landscape, outline the strengths and limitations of existing methods,
define the problem formally, survey evaluation tasks and datasets, and conclude
with open challenges and future directions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GRainsaCK是一个可复用的软件资源，用于标准化评估知识图谱链接预测中的解释方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱通常不完整，现有的链接预测方法缺乏可解释性，且缺乏统一的评估协议和基准资源。

Method: 提出GRainsaCK，通过模块化设计实现从模型训练到解释评估的全流程标准化。

Result: GRainsaCK提供了可扩展的模块化功能和详细的文档支持。

Conclusion: GRainsaCK填补了评估解释方法的空白，促进了可解释性研究的标准化和复用。

Abstract: Since Knowledge Graphs are often incomplete, link prediction methods are
adopted for predicting missing facts. Scalable embedding based solutions are
mostly adopted for this purpose, however, they lack comprehensibility, which
may be crucial in several domains. Explanation methods tackle this issue by
identifying supporting knowledge explaining the predicted facts. Regretfully,
evaluating/comparing quantitatively the resulting explanations is challenging
as there is no standard evaluation protocol and overall benchmarking resource.
We fill this important gap by proposing GRainsaCK, a reusable software resource
that fully streamlines all the tasks involved in benchmarking explanations,
i.e., from model training to evaluation of explanations along the same
evaluation protocol. Moreover, GRainsaCK furthers modularity/extensibility by
implementing the main components as functions that can be easily replaced.
Finally, fostering its reuse, we provide extensive documentation including a
tutorial.

TL;DR: E-Agent框架通过动态规划多模态工具和优化执行序列，显著提升了多模态检索增强生成（mRAG）的性能，减少了冗余搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有mRAG方法在动态规划和视觉信息利用上的不足，以应对实时场景需求。

Method: 提出E-Agent框架，包含动态规划的多模态工具协调器和任务执行器，并引入RemPlan基准测试。

Result: E-Agent在RemPlan及其他基准测试中表现优异，准确率提升13%，冗余搜索减少37%。

Conclusion: E-Agent通过动态规划和优化执行，显著提升了mRAG的效率和性能，适用于现实场景。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) has emerged as a promising
solution to address the temporal limitations of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) in real-world scenarios like news analysis and trending topics.
However, existing approaches often suffer from rigid retrieval strategies and
under-utilization of visual information. To bridge this gap, we propose
E-Agent, an agent framework featuring two key innovations: a mRAG planner
trained to dynamically orchestrate multimodal tools based on contextual
reasoning, and a task executor employing tool-aware execution sequencing to
implement optimized mRAG workflows. E-Agent adopts a one-time mRAG planning
strategy that enables efficient information retrieval while minimizing
redundant tool invocations. To rigorously assess the planning capabilities of
mRAG systems, we introduce the Real-World mRAG Planning (RemPlan) benchmark.
This novel benchmark contains both retrieval-dependent and
retrieval-independent question types, systematically annotated with essential
retrieval tools required for each instance. The benchmark's explicit mRAG
planning annotations and diverse question design enhance its practical
relevance by simulating real-world scenarios requiring dynamic mRAG decisions.
Experiments across RemPlan and three established benchmarks demonstrate
E-Agent's superiority: 13% accuracy gain over state-of-the-art mRAG methods
while reducing redundant searches by 37%.

TL;DR: MLLMs在情感识别任务中表现优于人类个体，但人类集体智慧及人机协作表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI（尤其是MLLMs）在情感识别任务中的表现，并与人类专家对比，以评估其情感智能潜力。

Method: 使用RMET和MRMET测试MLLMs和人类的情感识别能力，并比较个体、集体及协作模式的表现。

Result: MLLMs在个体测试中优于人类，但人类集体智慧表现更佳；人机协作模式准确性最高。

Conclusion: MLLMs在个体层面表现优异，但人类集体智慧和人机协作是情感AI发展的更优路径。

Abstract: The ability to discern subtle emotional cues is fundamental to human social
intelligence. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's
ability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective
human-AI interactions. In particular, whether such systems can match or surpass
human experts remains to be seen. However, the emotional intelligence of AI,
particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely
unexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs
using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial
counterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.
Results show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately
identifying emotions across both tests. This trend persists even when comparing
performance across low, medium, and expert-level performing groups. Yet when we
aggregate independent human decisions to simulate collective intelligence,
human groups significantly surpass the performance of aggregated MLLM
predictions, highlighting the wisdom of the crowd. Moreover, a collaborative
approach (augmented intelligence) that combines human and MLLM predictions
achieves greater accuracy than either humans or MLLMs alone. These results
suggest that while MLLMs exhibit strong emotion recognition at the individual
level, the collective intelligence of humans and the synergistic potential of
human-AI collaboration offer the most promising path toward effective emotional
AI. We discuss the implications of these findings for the development of
emotionally intelligent AI systems and future research directions.

TL;DR: 当前工具集成的数学推理系统通常采用单代理范式，导致认知负载干扰。提出双代理混合框架，分离推理与代码生成任务，通过模仿学习和强化学习优化性能。

Motivation: 单代理范式在推理和代码生成之间切换时产生认知负载干扰，影响性能。

Method: 提出双代理框架：推理代理负责问题分解，代码代理处理代码生成与执行。训练结合模仿学习和强化学习。

Result: 双代理框架显著减少认知干扰，提升推理与代码生成的协调稳定性。

Conclusion: 分离推理与代码生成任务的双代理设计能有效提升数学推理系统的性能。

Abstract: Current tool-integrated mathematical reasoning systems often adopt a
single-agent paradigm, where one large language model handles problem
reasoning, code generation, and code execution in an integrated workflow. While
this design eases coordination, we hypothesize that it imposes cognitive load
interference, as the agent must interleave long-horizon reasoning with precise
program synthesis. We validate this hypothesis through a controlled comparison
between a reasoning-only agent and a reasoning-plus-code agent, finding that
the latter produces significantly fewer correct reasoning paths despite having
tool-calling capabilities. To address this, we propose a dual-agent hybrid
framework: a Reasoning Agent performs stepwise problem decomposition, and a
Code Agent handles code generation and execution. Training combines imitation
learning and reinforcement learning: the Code Agent receives strong rewards for
matching intermediate ground-truth programs and weaker rewards for valid
execution, while the Reasoning Agent is optimized chiefly via final-answer
accuracy using advantage estimation to credit intermediate steps. This
decoupled role design reduces cognitive interference and promotes stable
reasoning-coding coordination.

Abstract: Recent R1-Zero-like research further demonstrates that reasoning extension
has given large language models (LLMs) unprecedented reasoning capabilities,
and Reinforcement Learning is the core technology to elicit its complex
reasoning. However, conducting RL experiments directly on hyperscale models
involves high computational costs and resource demands, posing significant
risks. We propose the Compass-Thinker-7B model, which aims to explore the
potential of Reinforcement Learning with less computational resources and
costs, and provides insights for further research into RL recipes for larger
models. Compass-Thinker-7B is trained from an open source model through a
specially designed Reinforcement Learning Pipeline. we curate a dataset of 30k
verifiable mathematics problems for the Reinforcement Learning Pipeline. By
configuring data and training settings with different difficulty distributions
for different stages, the potential of the model is gradually released and the
training efficiency is improved. Extensive evaluations show that
Compass-Thinker-7B possesses exceptional reasoning potential, and achieves
superior performance on mathematics compared to the same-sized RL
model.Especially in the challenging AIME2024 evaluation, Compass-Thinker-7B
achieves 40% accuracy.

Motivation: 解决大型视觉语言模型在多模态输入下的隐式推理安全问题。

Result: 实验表明，简单上下文学习能显著减少隐式多模态威胁。

Conclusion: 需改进跨模态隐式推理能力以应对安全问题。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models face growing safety challenges with multimodal

vulnerability in LVLMs. Benign combined inputs trigger unsafe LVLM outputs due
to flawed or hidden reasoning. To showcase this, we developed Safe Semantics,
Unsafe Interpretations, the first dataset for this critical issue. Our
demonstrations show that even simple In-Context Learning with SSUI
significantly mitigates these implicit multimodal threats, underscoring the
urgent need to improve cross-modal implicit reasoning.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了前景理论（PT）是否适用于大型语言模型（LLMs），以及表达不确定性的认知标记（如“可能”）是否影响其决策行为。通过三阶段实验，发现PT对LLMs的建模并不完全可靠，尤其是当不确定性以多样化语言形式表达时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补前景理论在当代大型语言模型中的应用空白，以及认知标记对LLMs决策行为影响的研究不足。

Method: 设计基于经济问卷的三阶段实验，提出更通用和精确的评估框架，结合认知标记的概率值分析其对LLMs决策的影响。

Result: 前景理论对LLMs的决策建模并不一致可靠，尤其是在不确定性以多样化语言形式表达时。

Conclusion: 前景理论在LLMs中的应用需谨慎，认知标记的多样性会影响模型的决策行为。

Abstract: Prospect Theory (PT) models human decision-making under uncertainty, while
epistemic markers (e.g., maybe) serve to express uncertainty in language.
However, it remains largely unexplored whether Prospect Theory applies to
contemporary Large Language Models and whether epistemic markers, which express
human uncertainty, affect their decision-making behaviour. To address these
research gaps, we design a three-stage experiment based on economic
questionnaires. We propose a more general and precise evaluation framework to
model LLMs' decision-making behaviour under PT, introducing uncertainty through
the empirical probability values associated with commonly used epistemic
markers in comparable contexts. We then incorporate epistemic markers into the
evaluation framework based on their corresponding probability values to examine
their influence on LLM decision-making behaviours. Our findings suggest that
modelling LLMs' decision-making with PT is not consistently reliable,
particularly when uncertainty is expressed in diverse linguistic forms. Our
code is released in https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/MarPT.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional
promise for complex collaborative problem-solving, yet they face fundamental
challenges stemming from context window limitations that impair memory
consistency, role adherence, and procedural integrity. This paper introduces
Intrinsic Memory Agents, a novel framework that addresses these limitations
through structured agent-specific memories that evolve intrinsically with agent
outputs. Specifically, our method maintains role-aligned memory templates that
preserve specialized perspectives while focusing on task-relevant information.
We benchmark our approach on the PDDL dataset, comparing its performance to
existing state-of-the-art multi-agentic memory approaches and showing an
improvement of 38.6\% with the highest token efficiency. An additional
evaluation is performed on a complex data pipeline design task, we demonstrate
that our approach produces higher quality designs when comparing 5 metrics:
scalability, reliability, usability, cost-effectiveness and documentation with
additional qualitative evidence of the improvements. Our findings suggest that
addressing memory limitations through structured, intrinsic approaches can
improve the capabilities of multi-agent LLM systems on structured planning

Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLM）在社会系统中的广泛应用，其可能放大有害偏见的风险成为关键安全问题。传统方法通常将模型视为黑箱，效果有限。

Method: 1. 训练线性探针检测模型内部激活中的偏见表征；2. 计算转向向量，通过在推理时添加这些向量主动引导模型生成中性内容。

Result: 实验表明，探针能近乎完美地识别偏见内容，转向向量技术成功将偏见生成导向中性替代。

Conclusion: 该系统为构建更安全、可解释的LLM提供了一种直接且可复现的方法。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more integrated into societal systems,
the risk of them perpetuating and amplifying harmful biases becomes a critical
safety concern. Traditional methods for mitigating bias often rely on data
filtering or post-hoc output moderation, which treat the model as an opaque
black box. In this work, we introduce a complete, end-to-end system that uses
techniques from mechanistic interpretability to both identify and actively
mitigate bias directly within a model's internal workings. Our method involves
two primary stages. First, we train linear "probes" on the internal activations
of a model to detect the latent representations of various biases (e.g.,
gender, race, age). Our experiments on \texttt{gpt2-large} demonstrate that
these probes can identify biased content with near-perfect accuracy, revealing
that bias representations become most salient in the model's later layers.
Second, we leverage these findings to compute "steering vectors" by contrasting
the model's activation patterns for biased and neutral statements. By adding
these vectors during inference, we can actively steer the model's generative
process away from producing harmful, stereotypical, or biased content in
real-time. We demonstrate the efficacy of this activation steering technique,
showing that it successfully alters biased completions toward more neutral
alternatives. We present our work as a robust and reproducible system that
offers a more direct and interpretable approach to building safer and more
accountable LLMs.

Result: 在大规模真实数据集（超过3000万条记录）上，FiXGBoost表现出色，具有高可解释性。

Conclusion: FiXGBoost为预请求等待时间预测提供了有效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Passenger waiting time prediction plays a critical role in enhancing both
ridesharing user experience and platform efficiency. While most existing
research focuses on post-request waiting time prediction with knowing the
matched driver information, pre-request waiting time prediction (i.e., before
submitting a ride request and without matching a driver) is also important, as
it enables passengers to plan their trips more effectively and enhance the
experience of both passengers and drivers. However, it has not been fully
studied by existing works. In this paper, we take the first step toward
understanding the predictability and explainability of pre-request passenger
waiting time in ridesharing systems. Particularly, we conduct an in-depth
data-driven study to investigate the impact of demand&supply dynamics on
passenger waiting time. Based on this analysis and feature engineering, we
propose FiXGBoost, a novel feature interaction-based XGBoost model designed to
predict waiting time without knowing the assigned driver information. We
further perform an importance analysis to quantify the contribution of each
factor. Experiments on a large-scale real-world ridesharing dataset including
over 30 million trip records show that our FiXGBoost can achieve a good
performance for pre-request passenger waiting time prediction with high
explainability.

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展适用于全球部署的CVCM及其他轨道电路系统，显著提升运行可靠性。

Abstract: Track circuits are critical for railway operations, acting as the main
signalling sub-system to locate trains. Continuous Variable Current Modulation
(CVCM) is one such technology. Like any field-deployed, safety-critical asset,
it can fail, triggering cascading disruptions. Many failures originate as
subtle anomalies that evolve over time, often not visually apparent in
monitored signals. Conventional approaches, which rely on clear signal changes,
struggle to detect them early. Early identification of failure types is
essential to improve maintenance planning, minimising downtime and revenue
loss. Leveraging deep neural networks, we propose a predictive maintenance
framework that classifies anomalies well before they escalate into failures.
Validated on 10 CVCM failure cases across different installations, the method
is ISO-17359 compliant and outperforms conventional techniques, achieving
99.31% overall accuracy with detection within 1% of anomaly onset. Through
conformal prediction, we provide uncertainty estimates, reaching 99% confidence
with consistent coverage across classes. Given CVCMs global deployment, the
approach is scalable and adaptable to other track circuits and railway systems,
enhancing operational reliability.

Method: 设计了基于零阶优化的属性估计机制，通过大规模扰动采样和岭回归建模，近似输入对输出的真实影响；并引入跨模态属性技术，将图像输入投影为文本描述。

Result: SMA首次实现了对MRAG系统中图像检索痕迹的成员推理，并能细粒度地追踪生成内容的来源。

Conclusion: SMA将成员推理的关注点从‘数据是否被记忆’转向‘内容来源’，为复杂生成系统的数据来源审计提供了新视角。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (MRAG) significantly improve the knowledge coverage and contextual
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing external knowledge
sources. However, retrieval and multimodal fusion obscure content provenance,
rendering existing membership inference methods unable to reliably attribute
generated outputs to pre-training, external retrieval, or user input, thus
undermining privacy leakage accountability
  To address these challenges, we propose the first Source-aware Membership
Audit (SMA) that enables fine-grained source attribution of generated content
in a semi-black-box setting with retrieval control capabilities.To address the
environmental constraints of semi-black-box auditing, we further design an
attribution estimation mechanism based on zero-order optimization, which
robustly approximates the true influence of input tokens on the output through
large-scale perturbation sampling and ridge regression modeling. In addition,
SMA introduces a cross-modal attribution technique that projects image inputs
into textual descriptions via MLLMs, enabling token-level attribution in the
text modality, which for the first time facilitates membership inference on
image retrieval traces in MRAG systems. This work shifts the focus of
membership inference from 'whether the data has been memorized' to 'where the
content is sourced from', offering a novel perspective for auditing data
provenance in complex generative systems.

Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在计算机任务中的潜力增长，研究社区需要开放的CUA框架以研究其能力、局限性和风险。

Method: OpenCUA框架包括标注基础设施、大规模数据集AgentNet、以及将演示转化为状态-动作对的管道，支持长链推理。

Conclusion: OpenCUA为CUA研究提供了开放基础，其方法在跨领域泛化和计算扩展方面表现优异。

Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities as
computer-use agents (CUAs) capable of automating diverse computer tasks. As
their commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA
systems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital
interactions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research
community needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities,
limitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive
open-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework
consists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human
computer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use
task dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites;
(3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs
with reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance
gains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong
performance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-32B achieves an
average success rate of 34.8% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models and surpassing OpenAI CUA
(GPT-4o). Further analysis confirms that our approach generalizes well across
domains and benefits significantly from increased test-time computation. We

*Xianghe Pang,Shuo Tang,Rui Ye,Yuwen Du,Yaxin Du,Siheng Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BrowseMaster框架通过规划器-执行器分工，解决了LLM代理在信息搜索中的广度与深度平衡问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理在信息搜索中因搜索广度和推理深度不足而表现不佳，需改进。

Method: 提出BrowseMaster框架，通过规划器制定搜索策略，执行器高效检索，实现广度与深度的平衡。

Result: 在英语和中文基准测试中，BrowseMaster表现优异，得分分别为30.0和46.5。

Conclusion: BrowseMaster在复杂信息搜索任务中表现出色，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Effective information seeking in the vast and ever-growing digital landscape
requires balancing expansive search with strategic reasoning. Current large
language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to achieve this balance due to
limitations in search breadth and reasoning depth, where slow, serial querying
restricts coverage of relevant sources and noisy raw inputs disrupt the
continuity of multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose
BrowseMaster, a scalable framework built around a programmatically augmented
planner-executor agent pair. The planner formulates and adapts search
strategies based on task constraints, while the executor conducts efficient,
targeted retrieval to supply the planner with concise, relevant evidence. This
division of labor preserves coherent, long-horizon reasoning while sustaining
broad and systematic exploration, overcoming the trade-off that limits existing
agents. Extensive experiments on challenging English and Chinese benchmarks
show that BrowseMaster consistently outperforms open-source and proprietary
baselines, achieving scores of 30.0 on BrowseComp-en and 46.5 on BrowseComp-zh,
which demonstrates its strong capability in complex, reasoning-heavy
information-seeking tasks at scale.

*Yi Tang,Kaini Wang,Yang Chen,Guangquan Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EndoAgent是一个基于双记忆设计的AI代理，用于内窥镜图像分析，通过短期行动跟踪和长期经验学习提升决策能力，优于现有通用和医学多模态模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大规模预训练的方法在多任务协调和处理复杂临床流程方面存在不足，AI代理在内窥镜领域的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出EndoAgent，采用双记忆设计（短期行动跟踪和长期经验学习），集成专家设计工具，并引入EndoAgentBench基准测试。

Result: 实验表明EndoAgent在视觉理解和语言生成能力上优于通用及医学多模态模型。

Conclusion: EndoAgent展示了强大的灵活性和推理能力，为内窥镜图像诊断提供了新思路。

Abstract: Developing general artificial intelligence (AI) systems to support endoscopic
image diagnosis is an emerging research priority. Existing methods based on
large-scale pretraining often lack unified coordination across tasks and
struggle to handle the multi-step processes required in complex clinical
workflows. While AI agents have shown promise in flexible instruction parsing
and tool integration across domains, their potential in endoscopy remains
underexplored. To address this gap, we propose EndoAgent, the first
memory-guided agent for vision-to-decision endoscopic analysis that integrates
iterative reasoning with adaptive tool selection and collaboration. Built on a
dual-memory design, it enables sophisticated decision-making by ensuring
logical coherence through short-term action tracking and progressively
enhancing reasoning acuity through long-term experiential learning. To support
diverse clinical tasks, EndoAgent integrates a suite of expert-designed tools
within a unified reasoning loop. We further introduce EndoAgentBench, a
benchmark of 5,709 visual question-answer pairs that assess visual
understanding and language generation capabilities in realistic scenarios.
Extensive experiments show that EndoAgent consistently outperforms both general
and medical multimodal models, exhibiting its strong flexibility and reasoning
capabilities.

### [177] [Benchmarking Large Language Models for Geolocating Colonial Virginia Land Grants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08266)
*Ryan Mioduski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在将弗吉尼亚17-18世纪土地专利描述转换为地理坐标时的表现，发现某些模型在准确性和成本效益上优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史土地专利的描述多为文字形式，限制了空间分析，因此需要一种高效、准确的方法将其转换为地理坐标。

Method: 研究使用了六种OpenAI模型，分为直接转换和工具增强两种范式，并与GIS分析师等基准进行比较。

Result: 最佳模型平均误差为23公里，优于其他模型和基准方法。成本效益高的模型在每1000份专利中仅需1.09美元。

Conclusion: LLMs在历史地理参考中具有可扩展性、准确性和成本效益的潜力。

Abstract: Virginia's seventeenth- and eighteenth-century land patents survive primarily
as narrative metes-and-bounds descriptions, limiting spatial analysis. This
study systematically evaluates current-generation large language models (LLMs)
in converting these prose abstracts into geographically accurate
latitude/longitude coordinates within a focused evaluation context. A digitized
corpus of 5,471 Virginia patent abstracts (1695-1732) is released, with 43
rigorously verified test cases serving as an initial, geographically focused
benchmark. Six OpenAI models across three architectures (o-series, GPT-4-class,
and GPT-3.5) were tested under two paradigms: direct-to-coordinate and
tool-augmented chain-of-thought invoking external geocoding APIs. Results were
compared with a GIS-analyst baseline, the Stanford NER geoparser, Mordecai-3,
and a county-centroid heuristic.
  The top single-call model, o3-2025-04-16, achieved a mean error of 23 km
(median 14 km), outperforming the median LLM (37.4 km) by 37.5%, the weakest
LLM (50.3 km) by 53.5%, and external baselines by 67% (GIS analyst) and 70%
(Stanford NER). A five-call ensemble further reduced errors to 19 km (median 12
km) at minimal additional cost (approx. USD 0.20 per grant), outperforming the
median LLM by 48.6%. A patentee-name-redaction ablation increased error by
about 9%, indicating reliance on textual landmark and adjacency descriptions
rather than memorization. The cost-efficient gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model maintained
a 28 km mean error at USD 1.09 per 1,000 grants, establishing a strong
cost-accuracy benchmark; external geocoding tools offered no measurable benefit
in this evaluation.
  These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs for scalable, accurate, and
cost-effective historical georeferencing.

Motivation: 现有基于基础LLMs的多模态医学AI难以理解复杂医学概念且缺乏医学训练数据，而近期LLaVA诱导的医学LMMs在捕捉文本与图像关系上效果不佳。

Method: Doctor Sun整合了预训练视觉编码器和医学LLM，通过两阶段训练（特征对齐和指令调优）处理多种医学数据模态。

Result: 发布了SunMed-VL双语医学多模态数据集及相关模型、代码和资源，支持生物医学多模态研究的发展。

Conclusion: Doctor Sun为医学多模态任务提供了更高效的解决方案，并通过开源资源推动领域进步。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
providing innovative solutions for various biomedical tasks, including
pathology analysis, radiology report generation, and biomedical assistance.
However, the existing multimodal biomedical AI is typically based on foundation
LLMs, thus hindering the understanding of intricate medical concepts with
limited medical training data. Moreover, recent LLaVA-induced medical LMMs
struggle to effectively capture the intricate relationship between the texts
and the images. Therefore, we introduce Doctor Sun, a large multimodal
generative model specialized in medicine, developed to encode, integrate, and
interpret diverse biomedical data modalities such as text and images. In
particular, Doctor Sun integrates a pre-trained vision encoder with a medical
LLM and conducts two-stage training on various medical datasets, focusing on
feature alignment and instruction tuning. Moreover, we release SunMed-VL, a
wide-range bilingual medical multimodal dataset, along with all associated
models, code, and resources, to freely support the advancement of biomedical
multimodal research.

TL;DR: Hat-DFed是一个异构感知且成本高效的分散式联邦学习框架，通过动态构建通信拓扑和重要性感知模型聚合，优化模型性能和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分散式联邦学习（DFL）中因模型复杂度、参与者数量、拓扑动态变化、资源异构性和数据异构性带来的高成本和性能下降问题。

Method: 提出Hat-DFed框架，将拓扑构建建模为双优化问题，设计两阶段算法动态优化通信拓扑，并结合重要性感知模型聚合机制。

Result: 框架在复杂边缘环境中最大化模型性能的同时最小化累积能耗，并缓解数据异构性导致的性能下降。

Conclusion: Hat-DFed为边缘计算系统中的DFL提供了一种高效且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm within edge
computing (EC) systems, enabling numerous edge devices to collaboratively train
artificial intelligence (AI) models while maintaining data privacy. To overcome
the communication bottlenecks associated with centralized parameter servers,
decentralized federated learning (DFL), which leverages peer-to-peer (P2P)
communication, has been extensively explored in the research community.
Although researchers design a variety of DFL approach to ensure model
convergence, its iterative learning process inevitably incurs considerable cost
along with the growth of model complexity and the number of participants. These
costs are largely influenced by the dynamic changes of topology in each
training round, particularly its sparsity and connectivity conditions.
Furthermore, the inherent resources heterogeneity in the edge environments
affects energy efficiency of learning process, while data heterogeneity
degrades model performance. These factors pose significant challenges to the
design of an effective DFL framework for EC systems. To this end, we propose
Hat-DFed, a heterogeneity-aware and coset-effective decentralized federated
learning (DFL) framework. In Hat-DFed, the topology construction is formulated
as a dual optimization problem, which is then proven to be NP-hard, with the
goal of maximizing model performance while minimizing cumulative energy
consumption in complex edge environments. To solve this problem, we design a
two-phase algorithm that dynamically constructs optimal communication
topologies while unbiasedly estimating their impact on both model performance
and energy cost. Additionally, the algorithm incorporates an importance-aware
model aggregation mechanism to mitigate performance degradation caused by data
heterogeneity.

TL;DR: XFMNet是一种逐步多模态融合网络，用于解决多站点水质预测中的时空动态建模问题，通过整合遥感降水图像提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水质预测面临周期性、非平稳性和生态因素引起的突变等挑战，多站点场景下时空动态建模更为复杂。

Method: XFMNet通过自适应降采样对齐时间分辨率，局部自适应分解趋势和周期成分，利用交叉注意力门控融合模块动态整合时空和生态信息。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，XFMNet显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: XFMNet在时空分布时间序列预测中表现出色，为水质预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Long-term time-series forecasting is critical for environmental monitoring,
yet water quality prediction remains challenging due to complex periodicity,
nonstationarity, and abrupt fluctuations induced by ecological factors. These
challenges are further amplified in multi-site scenarios that require
simultaneous modeling of temporal and spatial dynamics. To tackle this, we
introduce XFMNet, a stepwise multimodal fusion network that integrates remote
sensing precipitation imagery to provide spatial and environmental context in
river networks. XFMNet first aligns temporal resolutions between water quality
series and remote sensing inputs via adaptive downsampling, followed by locally
adaptive decomposition to disentangle trend and cycle components. A
cross-attention gated fusion module dynamically integrates temporal patterns
with spatial and ecological cues, enhancing robustness to nonstationarity and
site-specific anomalies. Through progressive and recursive fusion, XFMNet
captures both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of XFMNet for
spatially distributed time series prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习方法在领域偏移时性能下降，尤其是在时间序列数据中，噪声和顺序依赖性导致性能显著降低。

Method: MoSSDA采用领域不变编码器和混合增强对比模块，通过两阶段学习获得稳健且领域不变的特征表示。

Result: 在六个数据集上，MoSSDA实现了最先进的性能，并通过消融研究验证了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: MoSSDA通过两阶段学习和对比模块，显著提升了时间序列分类在领域偏移下的性能。

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as the most promising approach in various fields;
however, when the distributions of training and test data are different (domain
shift), the performance of deep learning models can degrade. Semi-supervised
domain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue,
assuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but
the test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this
study, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework,
MoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are
highly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts
resulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust,
domain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a
domain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains.
Subsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive
contrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final
classifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and
discriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data
augmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow
between the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex
representations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA
achieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various
unlabeled ratios in the target domain data. The Ablation study confirms that
each module, including two-stage learning, is effective in improving the
performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/seonyoungKimm/MoSSDA

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多粒度时空特征互补（MGSTC）的在线蜂窝流量预测方法，解决了现有研究中忽略流量突发性和概念漂移的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电信行业仍依赖人工干预，现有研究多关注时空相关性，但忽略了蜂窝流量的突发性和概念漂移对预测准确性的影响。

Method: MGSTC将历史数据分块，利用粗粒度时间注意力提供趋势参考，细粒度空间注意力捕捉网络元素间的详细相关性，并结合在线学习策略实时检测概念漂移。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，MGSTC优于11种最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: MGSTC能高效处理连续预测任务，提升预测精度。

Abstract: Knowledge discovered from telecom data can facilitate proactive understanding
of network dynamics and user behaviors, which in turn empowers service
providers to optimize cellular traffic scheduling and resource allocation.
Nevertheless, the telecom industry still heavily relies on manual expert
intervention. Existing studies have been focused on exhaustively explore the
spatial-temporal correlations. However, they often overlook the underlying
characteristics of cellular traffic, which are shaped by the sporadic and
bursty nature of telecom services. Additionally, concept drift creates
substantial obstacles to maintaining satisfactory accuracy in continuous
cellular forecasting tasks. To resolve these problems, we put forward an online
cellular traffic prediction method grounded in Multi-Grained Spatial-Temporal
feature Complementarity (MGSTC). The proposed method is devised to achieve
high-precision predictions in practical continuous forecasting scenarios.
Concretely, MGSTC segments historical data into chunks and employs the
coarse-grained temporal attention to offer a trend reference for the prediction
horizon. Subsequently, fine-grained spatial attention is utilized to capture
detailed correlations among network elements, which enables localized
refinement of the established trend. The complementarity of these multi-grained
spatial-temporal features facilitates the efficient transmission of valuable
information. To accommodate continuous forecasting needs, we implement an
online learning strategy that can detect concept drift in real-time and
promptly switch to the appropriate parameter update stage. Experiments carried
out on four real-world datasets demonstrate that MGSTC outperforms eleven
state-of-the-art baselines consistently.

Result: 提出了三个理论见解：注意力头的存储容量、误差传播分析以及生物学学习规则对Transformer架构的潜在增强。

Conclusion: 现代AI的成功可能源于实现了生物学在数百万年进化中优化的计算原则，而不仅仅是架构创新。

Abstract: Transformer architectures have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI)
through their attention mechanisms, yet the computational principles underlying
their success remain opaque. We present a novel theoretical framework that
reinterprets the core computation of attention as Pavlovian conditioning. Our
model finds a direct mathematical analogue in linear attention, which
simplifies the analysis of the underlying associative process. We demonstrate
that attention's queries, keys, and values can be mapped to the three elements
of classical conditioning: test stimuli that probe associations, conditional
stimuli (CS) that serve as retrieval cues, and unconditional stimuli (US) that
contain response information. Through this lens, we suggest that each attention
operation constructs a transient associative memory via a Hebbian rule, where
CS-US pairs form dynamic associations that test stimuli can later retrieve. Our
framework yields several theoretical insights grounded in this linearized
model: (1) a capacity theorem showing that attention heads can store
O($\sqrt{d_k}$) associations before interference degrades retrieval; (2) an
error propagation analysis revealing fundamental architectural trade-offs of
balancing model depth, width, and head redundancy to maintain reliability; and
(3) an understanding of how biologically plausible learning rules could enhance
transformer architectures. By establishing this deep connection, we suggest
that the success of modern AI may stem not from architectural novelty alone,
but from implementing computational principles that biology optimized over
millions of years of evolution.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在HSI目标识别中局限于单类别预测和预定义训练材料库，缺乏解释性和灵活性。

Method: 采用逆建模方法，结合物理条件（如大气和背景估计）和基于物理的损失标准，生成发射率分布并进行不确定性量化。

Result: 模型能够生成发射率分布并提供可解释的概率匹配，支持多种材料的可能性分析。

Conclusion: 该方法通过物理条件和概率建模，提高了HSI目标识别的解释性和灵活性。

Abstract: Recent research has proven neural networks to be a powerful tool for
performing hyperspectral imaging (HSI) target identification. However, many
deep learning frameworks deliver a single material class prediction and operate
on a per-pixel basis; such approaches are limited in their interpretability and
restricted to predicting materials that are accessible in available training
libraries. In this work, we present an inverse modeling approach in the form of
a physics-conditioned generative model.A probabilistic latent-variable model
learns the underlying distribution of HSI radiance measurements and produces
the conditional distribution of the emissivity spectrum. Moreover, estimates of
the HSI scene's atmosphere and background are used as a physically relevant
conditioning mechanism to contextualize a given radiance measurement during the
encoding and decoding processes. Furthermore, we employ an in-the-loop
augmentation scheme and physics-based loss criteria to avoid bias towards a
predefined training material set and to encourage the model to learn physically
consistent inverse mappings. Monte-Carlo sampling of the model's conditioned
posterior delivers a sought emissivity distribution and allows for
interpretable uncertainty quantification. Moreover, a distribution-based
material matching scheme is presented to return a set of likely material
matches for an inferred emissivity distribution. Hence, we present a strategy
to incorporate contextual information about a given HSI scene, capture the
possible variation of underlying material spectra, and provide interpretable
probability measures of a candidate material accounting for given
remotely-sensed radiance measurement.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of channel-wise mixing via multi-layer perceptrons
(MLPs) on the generalization capabilities of recurrent convolutional networks.
Specifically, we compare two architectures: DARC (Depth Aware Recurrent
Convolution), which employs a simple recurrent convolutional structure, and
DAMP (Depth Aware Multi-layer Perceptron), which extends DARC with a gated MLP
for channel mixing. Using the Re-ARC benchmark, we find that DAMP significantly
outperforms DARC in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization
under exact-match grading criteria. These results suggest that explicit channel
mixing through MLPs enables recurrent convolutional networks to learn more
robust and generalizable computational patterns. Our findings have implications
for neural program synthesis and highlight the potential of DAMP as a target
architecture for hypernetwork approaches.

Motivation: 由于缺乏通用的基准测试（包括数据集、代码和比较指标），现有γ射线谱分析方法的评估和比较变得困难，因此需要建立一个统一的基准。

Method: 通过模拟三种不同场景下的γ射线谱数据集（已知谱特征、谱特征变形和谱特征偏移），比较统计解混方法和端到端机器学习方法的性能。

Result: 统计方法在所有场景和指标中均优于机器学习方法，但在谱特征建模不准确时性能显著下降；机器学习在不确定条件下表现更好。

Conclusion: 统计方法适用于已知或建模良好的谱特征，而机器学习在测量条件不确定时是更好的选择；统计方法在定量任务中更准确。

Abstract: During the last decade, a large number of different numerical methods have
been proposed to tackle the automatic identification and quantification in
{\gamma}-ray spectrometry. However, the lack of common benchmarks, including
datasets, code and comparison metrics, makes their evaluation and comparison
hard. In that context, we propose an open-source benchmark that comprises
simulated datasets of various {\gamma}-spectrometry settings, codes of
different analysis approaches and evaluation metrics. This allows us to compare
the state-of-the-art end-to-end machine learning with a statistical unmixing
approach using the full spectrum. Three scenarios have been investigated: (1)
spectral signatures are assumed to be known; (2) spectral signatures are
deformed due to physical phenomena such as Compton scattering and attenuation;
and (3) spectral signatures are shifted (e.g., due to temperature variation). A
large dataset of 200000 simulated spectra containing nine radionuclides with an
experimental natural background is used for each scenario with multiple
radionuclides present in the spectrum. Regarding identification performance,
the statistical approach consistently outperforms the machine learning
approaches across all three scenarios for all comparison metrics. However, the
performance of the statistical approach can be significantly impacted when
spectral signatures are not modeled correctly. Consequently, the full-spectrum
statistical approach is most effective with known or well-modeled spectral
signatures, while end-to-end machine learning is a good alternative when
measurement conditions are uncertain for radionuclide identification.
Concerning the quantification task, the statistical approach provides accurate
estimates of radionuclide counting, while the machine learning methods deliver
less satisfactory results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN在深度层存在过平滑问题，现有方法无法有效处理深层特征，Mamba虽能保留全局信息但忽略浅层细节，需解决全局-局部权衡问题。

Method: 提出HSA-Net框架，包含分层自适应投影器（HAP）模块和源感知融合（SAF）模块，动态选择投影方式并自适应融合多级特征。

Result: 实验表明HSA-Net在定量和定性上均优于当前最优方法。

Conclusion: HSA-Net通过分层和结构感知设计，有效解决了GNN的过平滑问题，提升了分子表示学习的性能。

Abstract: Molecular representation learning, a cornerstone for downstream tasks like
molecular captioning and molecular property prediction, heavily relies on Graph
Neural Networks (GNN). However, GNN suffers from the over-smoothing problem,
where node-level features collapse in deep GNN layers. While existing feature
projection methods with cross-attention have been introduced to mitigate this
issue, they still perform poorly in deep features. This motivated our
exploration of using Mamba as an alternative projector for its ability to
handle complex sequences. However, we observe that while Mamba excels at
preserving global topological information from deep layers, it neglects
fine-grained details in shallow layers. The capabilities of Mamba and
cross-attention exhibit a global-local trade-off. To resolve this critical
global-local trade-off, we propose Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Network
(HSA-Net), a novel framework with two modules that enables a hierarchical
feature projection and fusion. Firstly, a Hierarchical Adaptive Projector (HAP)
module is introduced to process features from different graph layers. It learns
to dynamically switch between a cross-attention projector for shallow layers
and a structure-aware Graph-Mamba projector for deep layers, producing
high-quality, multi-level features. Secondly, to adaptively merge these
multi-level features, we design a Source-Aware Fusion (SAF) module, which
flexibly selects fusion experts based on the characteristics of the aggregation
features, ensuring a precise and effective final representation fusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HSA-Net framework quantitatively and

TL;DR: SHeRL-FL是一种结合分层联邦学习和分割学习的新方法，通过中间层表示学习减少通信开销和协调复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法在计算异构性和通信成本方面存在问题，尤其是在资源受限设备上。

Method: 结合分割学习和分层模型聚合，引入中间层表示学习，使客户端和边缘服务器独立计算训练目标。

Result: 实验表明，SHeRL-FL在图像分类和分割任务中显著减少数据传输，比现有方法更高效。

Conclusion: SHeRL-FL有效解决了联邦学习中的通信和协调问题，提升了效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach for addressing scalability
and latency issues in large-scale networks by enabling collaborative model
training without requiring the sharing of raw data. However, existing FL
frameworks often overlook the computational heterogeneity of edge clients and
the growing training burden on resource-limited devices. However, FL suffers
from high communication costs and complex model aggregation, especially with
large models. Previous works combine split learning (SL) and hierarchical FL
(HierFL) to reduce device-side computation and improve scalability, but this
introduces training complexity due to coordination across tiers. To address
these issues, we propose SHeRL-FL, which integrates SL and hierarchical model
aggregation and incorporates representation learning at intermediate layers. By
allowing clients and edge servers to compute training objectives independently
of the cloud, SHeRL-FL significantly reduces both coordination complexity and
communication overhead. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of
SHeRL-FL, we performed experiments on image classification tasks using
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and HAM10000 with AlexNet, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50 in
both IID and non-IID settings. In addition, we evaluate performance on image
segmentation tasks using the ISIC-2018 dataset with a ResNet-50-based U-Net.
Experimental results demonstrate that SHeRL-FL reduces data transmission by
over 90\% compared to centralized FL and HierFL, and by 50\% compared to
SplitFed, which is a hybrid of FL and SL, and further improves hierarchical
split learning methods.

*Artem Hnilov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine (FPTM) 通过模糊评估子句，显著减少了子句数量、内存占用和训练时间，同时提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的 Tsetlin Machine (TM) 采用严格的“全有或全无”子句评估策略，需要大量子句才能达到竞争性准确率。FPTM 旨在通过模糊评估机制解决这一问题。

Method: FPTM 引入模糊评估机制，允许部分子句失败时仍能贡献部分分数，从而更灵活地匹配模式。

Result: 在多个数据集上，FPTM 显著减少了子句数量和资源消耗，同时提高了准确性和训练速度。例如，在 IMDb 数据集上，仅需 1 个子句即可达到 90.15% 的准确率。

Conclusion: FPTM 是一种高效、灵活且资源友好的 TM 变体，适用于在线学习和资源受限的环境。

Abstract: The "all-or-nothing" clause evaluation strategy is a core mechanism in the
Tsetlin Machine (TM) family of algorithms. In this approach, each clause - a
logical pattern composed of binary literals mapped to input data - is
disqualified from voting if even a single literal fails. Due to this strict
requirement, standard TMs must employ thousands of clauses to achieve
competitive accuracy. This paper introduces the Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine
(FPTM), a novel variant where clause evaluation is fuzzy rather than strict. If
some literals in a clause fail, the remaining ones can still contribute to the
overall vote with a proportionally reduced score. As a result, each clause
effectively consists of sub-patterns that adapt individually to the input,
enabling more flexible, efficient, and robust pattern matching. The proposed
fuzzy mechanism significantly reduces the required number of clauses, memory
footprint, and training time, while simultaneously improving accuracy. On the
IMDb dataset, FPTM achieves 90.15% accuracy with only one clause per class, a
50x reduction in clauses and memory over the Coalesced Tsetlin Machine. FPTM
trains up to 316x faster (45 seconds vs. 4 hours) and fits within 50 KB,
enabling online learning on microcontrollers. Inference throughput reaches 34.5
million predictions/second (51.4 GB/s). On Fashion-MNIST, accuracy reaches
92.18% (2 clauses), 93.19% (20 clauses) and 94.68% (8000 clauses), a ~400x
clause reduction compared to the Composite TM's 93.00% (8000 clauses). On the
Amazon Sales dataset with 20% noise, FPTM achieves 85.22% accuracy,
significantly outperforming the Graph Tsetlin Machine (78.17%) and a Graph
Convolutional Neural Network (66.23%).

TL;DR: 本文从第一性原理出发，为缩放点积注意力机制（SDPA）提供了理论依据，揭示了其前向传播与熵最优传输问题的联系，并证明反向传播梯度与强化学习中的优势策略梯度等价。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SDPA机制多基于启发式设计，缺乏理论支撑，本文旨在从优化角度为其提供严格的数学解释。

Method: 将SDPA前向传播建模为退化的一侧熵最优传输问题，分析其信息几何特性，并证明反向传播梯度与优势策略梯度的等价性。

Result: 前向传播是熵最优传输问题的精确解，反向传播梯度具有特定的信息几何结构，与优势策略梯度一致。

Conclusion: SDPA是一种基于优化原理的机制，前向传播实现最优推断，反向传播执行合理的流形感知学习更新。

Abstract: The scaled-dot-product attention (SDPA) mechanism is a core component of
modern deep learning, but its mathematical form is often motivated by
heuristics. This work provides a first-principles justification for SDPA. We
first show that the attention forward pass is the exact solution to a
degenerate, one-sided Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem, which seeks a
distribution that maximizes similarity while being maximally entropic. This
optimization perspective has a direct consequence for the backward pass. We
prove that the standard gradient computed via backpropagation is mathematically
identical to an advantage-based policy gradient, a variance-reduced update rule
from reinforcement learning. Crucially, we demonstrate that the EOT formulation
of the forward pass induces a specific information geometry on the space of
attention distributions. It is this geometry, characterized by the Fisher
Information Matrix, that dictates the precise form of the learning gradient,
revealing the advantage-based update as a natural consequence of the
optimization problem being solved. This unified view reveals SDPA as a
principled mechanism where the forward pass performs optimal inference and the
backward pass implements a rational, manifold-aware learning update.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider the problem of online regret minimization in linear bandits with
access to prior observations (offline data) from the underlying bandit model.
There are numerous applications where extensive offline data is often
available, such as in recommendation systems, online advertising. Consequently,
this problem has been studied intensively in recent literature. Our algorithm,
Offline-Online Phased Elimination (OOPE), effectively incorporates the offline
data to substantially reduce the online regret compared to prior work. To
leverage offline information prudently, OOPE uses an extended D-optimal design
within each exploration phase. OOPE achieves an online regret is
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\deff T \log \left(|\mathcal{A}|T\right)}+d^2)$. $\deff \leq
d)$ is the effective problem dimension which measures the number of poorly
explored directions in offline data and depends on the eigen-spectrum
$(\lambda_k)_{k \in [d]}$ of the Gram matrix of the offline data. The
eigen-spectrum $(\lambda_k)_{k \in [d]}$ is a quantitative measure of the
\emph{quality} of offline data. If the offline data is poorly explored ($\deff
\approx d$), we recover the established regret bounds for purely online setting
while, when offline data is abundant ($\Toff >> T$) and well-explored ($\deff =
o(1) $), the online regret reduces substantially. Additionally, we provide the
first known minimax regret lower bounds in this setting that depend explicitly
on the quality of the offline data. These lower bounds establish the optimality
of our algorithm in regimes where offline data is either well-explored or
poorly explored. Finally, by using a Frank-Wolfe approximation to the extended
optimal design we further improve the $O(d^{2})$ term to
$O\left(\frac{d^{2}}{\deff} \min \{ \deff,1\} \right)$, which can be
substantial in high dimensions with moderate quality of offline data $\deff =
\Omega(1)$.

Result: FWPs展示了动态权重调整的能力，与Transformer和状态空间模型有显著联系，并可能模拟大脑突触可塑性。

Conclusion: FWPs为人工和自然智能的融合提供了新视角，具有潜在的研究和应用价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial neural networks for machine learning, and
language modeling in particular, have established a family of recurrent neural
network (RNN) architectures that, unlike conventional RNNs with vector-form
hidden states, use two-dimensional (2D) matrix-form hidden states. Such
2D-state RNNs, known as Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs), can be interpreted as a
neural network whose synaptic weights (called fast weights) dynamically change
over time as a function of input observations, and serve as short-term memory
storage; corresponding synaptic weight modifications are controlled or
programmed by another network (the programmer) whose parameters are trained
(e.g., by gradient descent). In this Primer, we review the technical
foundations of FWPs, their computational characteristics, and their connections
to transformers and state space models. We also discuss connections between
FWPs and models of synaptic plasticity in the brain, suggesting a convergence
of natural and artificial intelligence.

Motivation: 现实系统中常存在未观测变量和循环因果图，现有方法假设线性或难以扩展。

Result: 在合成数据和真实基因扰动数据上，DCCD-CONF优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DCCD-CONF在理论和实际中均表现优异，具有一致性保证。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships between variables is fundamental across
scientific disciplines. Most causal discovery algorithms rely on two key
assumptions: (i) all variables are observed, and (ii) the underlying causal
graph is acyclic. While these assumptions simplify theoretical analysis, they
are often violated in real-world systems, such as biological networks. Existing
methods that account for confounders either assume linearity or struggle with
scalability. To address these limitations, we propose DCCD-CONF, a novel
framework for differentiable learning of nonlinear cyclic causal graphs in the
presence of unmeasured confounders using interventional data. Our approach
alternates between optimizing the graph structure and estimating the confounder
distribution by maximizing the log-likelihood of the data. Through experiments
on synthetic data and real-world gene perturbation datasets, we show that
DCCD-CONF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both causal graph recovery
and confounder identification. Additionally, we also provide consistency
guarantees for our framework, reinforcing its theoretical soundness.

Abstract: Liver cancer is one of the most prevalent and lethal forms of cancer, making
early detection crucial for effective treatment. This paper introduces a novel
approach for automated liver tumor segmentation in computed tomography (CT)
images by integrating a 3D U-Net architecture with the Bat Algorithm for
hyperparameter optimization. The method enhances segmentation accuracy and
robustness by intelligently optimizing key parameters like the learning rate
and batch size. Evaluated on a publicly available dataset, our model
demonstrates a strong ability to balance precision and recall, with a high
F1-score at lower prediction thresholds. This is particularly valuable for
clinical diagnostics, where ensuring no potential tumors are missed is
paramount. Our work contributes to the field of medical image analysis by
demonstrating that the synergy between a robust deep learning architecture and
a metaheuristic optimization algorithm can yield a highly effective solution
for complex segmentation tasks.

Motivation: 异构图神经网络（HGNNs）的预测缺乏透明度，现有的事后解释方法无法支持实际节点特征且解释不真实。

Method: 提出DiGNNExplainer，利用离散去噪扩散在离散空间中生成真实的离散特征（如词袋特征）。

Result: 在多个数据集上评估表明，DiGNNExplainer生成的解释既真实又忠实于模型决策，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiGNNExplainer填补了异构图解释方法的空白，提供了更真实和忠实的解释。

Abstract: Many real-world datasets, such as citation networks, social networks, and
molecular structures, are naturally represented as heterogeneous graphs, where
nodes belong to different types and have additional features. For example, in a
citation network, nodes representing "Paper" or "Author" may include attributes
like keywords or affiliations. A critical machine learning task on these graphs
is node classification, which is useful for applications such as fake news
detection, corporate risk assessment, and molecular property prediction.
Although Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) perform well in these
contexts, their predictions remain opaque. Existing post-hoc explanation
methods lack support for actual node features beyond one-hot encoding of node
type and often fail to generate realistic, faithful explanations. To address
these gaps, we propose DiGNNExplainer, a model-level explanation approach that
synthesizes heterogeneous graphs with realistic node features via discrete
denoising diffusion. In particular, we generate realistic discrete features
(e.g., bag-of-words features) using diffusion models within a discrete space,
whereas previous approaches are limited to continuous spaces. We evaluate our
approach on multiple datasets and show that DiGNNExplainer produces
explanations that are realistic and faithful to the model's decision-making,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最优传输（OT）要求输入测度质量相等，而部分最优传输（POT）放宽了这一限制，但现有方法因依赖熵正则化导致传输计划密集，限制了其在需要稀疏性的应用中的使用。

Method: 提出了一种二次正则化的POT（QPOT）方法，通过二次正则化诱导稀疏的传输计划。

Result: 在合成数据集、CIFAR-10数据集及实际应用（如颜色迁移和领域适应）中，QPOT表现出更高的稀疏性和优越性能。

Conclusion: QPOT为POT提供了一种稀疏性更强的替代方案，适用于需要稀疏传输计划的应用场景。

Abstract: Partial Optimal Transport (POT) has recently emerged as a central tool in
various Machine Learning (ML) applications. It lifts the stringent assumption
of the conventional Optimal Transport (OT) that input measures are of equal
masses, which is often not guaranteed in real-world datasets, and thus offers
greater flexibility by permitting transport between unbalanced input measures.
Nevertheless, existing major solvers for POT commonly rely on entropic
regularization for acceleration and thus return dense transport plans,
hindering the adoption of POT in various applications that favor sparsity. In
this paper, as an alternative approach to the entropic POT formulation in the
literature, we propose a novel formulation of POT with quadratic
regularization, hence termed quadratic regularized POT (QPOT), which induces
sparsity to the transport plan and consequently facilitates the adoption of POT
in many applications with sparsity requirements. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as real-world applications such as
color transfer and domain adaptations, consistently demonstrate the improved
sparsity and favorable performance of our proposed QPOT formulation.

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展到多种异构环境（如云平台和多节点高性能计算集群），为异构资源的高效利用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Most large-scale neural network training methods assume homogeneous parallel
computing resources. For example, synchronous SGD with data parallelism, the
most widely used parallel training strategy, incurs significant synchronization
overhead when workers process their assigned data at different speeds.
Consequently, in systems with heterogeneous compute resources, users often rely
solely on the fastest components, such as GPUs, for training. In this work, we
explore how to effectively use heterogeneous resources for neural network
training. We propose a system-aware local stochastic gradient descent (local
SGD) method that allocates workloads to each compute resource in proportion to
its compute capacity. To make better use of slower resources such as CPUs, we
intentionally introduce bias into data sampling and model aggregation. Our
study shows that well-controlled bias can significantly accelerate local SGD in
heterogeneous environments, achieving comparable or even higher accuracy than
synchronous SGD with data-parallelism within the same time budget. This
fundamental parallelization strategy can be readily extended to diverse
heterogeneous environments, including cloud platforms and multi-node
high-performance computing clusters.

Abstract: Achieving accurate traffic prediction is a fundamental but crucial task in
the development of current intelligent transportation systems.Most of the
mainstream methods that have made breakthroughs in traffic prediction rely on
spatio-temporal graph neural networks, spatio-temporal attention mechanisms,
etc. The main challenges of the existing deep learning approaches are that they
either depend on a complete traffic network structure or require intricate
model designs to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. These
limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and
operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs
time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but
also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts
(MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction
performance and lightweight deployment.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal prediction plays a critical role in numerous real-world
applications such as urban planning, transportation optimization, disaster
response, and pandemic control. In recent years, researchers have made
significant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for
spatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic,
i.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty,
leading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies
have introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically
focus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes),
thereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban
phenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network
with Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal
prediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware
Spatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph
convolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network
to effectively capture complex spatial and temporal interaction patterns, and
(ii) a multivariate probabilistic prediction module designed to estimate both
expected mean values and associated uncertainties. Extensive experiments on
four real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets from Shenzhen, New York
City, and Chicago demonstrate that UQGNN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty
quantification. For example, on the Shenzhen dataset, UQGNN achieves a 5%
improvement in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: SHEFL为计算异构环境下的联邦学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning enables distributed training with private data of clients,
but its convergence is hindered by data and system heterogeneity in realistic
communication scenarios. Most existing system heterogeneous FL schemes utilize
global pruning or ensemble distillation, yet they often overlook typical
constraints required for communication efficiency. Meanwhile, deep ensembles
can aggregate predictions from individually trained models to improve
performance, but current ensemble-based FL methods fall short in fully
capturing the diversity of model predictions. In this work, we propose SHEFL, a
global ensemble-based federated learning framework suited for clients with
diverse computational capacities. We allocate different numbers of global
models to clients based on their available resources. We further introduce a
novel aggregation scheme that accounts for bias between clients with different
computational capabilities. To reduce the computational burden of training deep
ensembles and mitigate data bias, we dynamically adjust the resource ratio
across clients - aggressively reducing the influence of underpowered clients in
constrained scenarios, while increasing their weight in the opposite case.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively addresses
computational heterogeneity, significantly improving both fairness and overall
performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed collaborative Machine Learning (ML)
framework under privacy-preserving constraints, has garnered increasing
research attention in cross-organizational data collaboration scenarios. This
paper proposes a class of distributed optimization algorithms based on the
augmented Lagrangian technique, designed to accommodate diverse communication
topologies in both centralized and decentralized FL settings. Furthermore, we
develop multiple termination criteria and parameter update mechanisms to
enhance computational efficiency, accompanied by rigorous theoretical
guarantees of convergence. By generalizing the augmented Lagrangian relaxation
through the incorporation of proximal relaxation and quadratic approximation,
our framework systematically recovers a broad of classical unconstrained
optimization methods, including proximal algorithm, classic gradient descent,
and stochastic gradient descent, among others. Notably, the convergence
properties of these methods can be naturally derived within the proposed
theoretical framework. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm exhibits strong performance in large-scale settings with significant
statistical heterogeneity across clients.

Result: 实验表明，该方法计算成本接近SVD低秩训练，同时精度与全秩训练相当。

Conclusion: 动态秩训练框架能有效平衡计算成本与模型性能。

Abstract: Low-rank training methods reduce the number of trainable parameters by
re-parameterizing the weights with matrix decompositions (e.g., singular value
decomposition). However, enforcing a fixed low-rank structure caps the rank of
the weight matrices and can hinder the model's ability to learn complex
patterns. Furthermore, the effective rank of the model's weights tends to
decline during training, and this drop is accelerated when the model is
reparameterized into a low-rank structure. In this study, we argue that
strategically interleaving full-rank training epochs within low-rank training
epochs can effectively restore the rank of the model's weights. Based on our
findings, we propose a general dynamic-rank training framework that is readily
applicable to a wide range of neural-network tasks. We first describe how to
adjust the rank of weight matrix to alleviate the inevitable rank collapse that
arises during training, and then present extensive empirical results that
validate our claims and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. Our
empirical study shows that the proposed method achieves almost the same
computational cost as SVD-based low-rank training while achieving a comparable
accuracy to full-rank training across various benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于任务特定令牌的稀疏微调策略，用于小型语言模型在专业分类任务中的适配，优于全微调和其他适配方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 专业语义分类任务需要领域专家标注且对推理吞吐量要求高，限制了大型语言模型的使用，因此需要针对小型模型的高效微调方法。

Method: 通过识别并微调模型中对任务特定令牌敏感的参数子集，保持大部分预训练权重不变，不引入额外参数。

Result: 在五个语义分类任务中表现优于全微调、LoRA、层选择和前缀调整，训练成本减半且稳定性更高。

Conclusion: 稀疏微调策略为专业分类任务提供了一种高效、稳定的解决方案，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: Semantic text classification requires the understanding of the contextual
significance of specific tokens rather than surface-level patterns or keywords
(as in rule-based or statistical text classification), making large language
models (LLMs) well-suited for this task. However, semantic classification
applications in industry, like customer intent detection or semantic role
labeling, tend to be highly specialized. They require annotation by domain
experts in contrast to general-purpose corpora for pretraining. Further, they
typically require high inference throughputs which limits the model size from
latency and cost perspectives. Thus, for a range of specialized classification
tasks, the preferred solution is to develop customized classifiers by
finetuning smaller language models (e.g., mini-encoders, small language
models).
  In this work, we develop a token-driven sparse finetuning strategy to adapt
small language models to specialized classification tasks. We identify and
finetune a small sensitive subset of model parameters by leveraging
task-specific token constructs in the finetuning dataset, while leaving most of
the pretrained weights unchanged. Unlike adapter approaches such as low rank
adaptation (LoRA), we do not introduce additional parameters to the model. Our
approach identifies highly relevant semantic tokens (case study in the
Appendix) and outperforms end-to-end finetuning, LoRA, layer selection, and
prefix tuning on five diverse semantic classification tasks. We achieve greater
stability and half the training costs vs. end-to-end finetuning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to black-box
optimization tasks, from program synthesis to molecule design. Prior work
typically leverages in-context learning to iteratively guide the model towards
better solutions. Such methods, however, often struggle to balance exploration
of new solution spaces with exploitation of high-reward ones. Recently,
test-time training (TTT) with synthetic data has shown promise in improving
solution quality. However, the need for hand-crafted training data tailored to
each task limits feasibility and scalability across domains. To address this
problem, we introduce MiGrATe-a method for online TTT that uses GRPO as a
search algorithm to adapt LLMs at inference without requiring external training
data. MiGrATe operates via a mixed-policy group construction procedure that
combines on-policy sampling with two off-policy data selection techniques:
greedy sampling, which selects top-performing past completions, and
neighborhood sampling (NS), which generates completions structurally similar to
high-reward ones. Together, these components bias the policy gradient towards
exploitation of promising regions in solution space, while preserving
exploration through on-policy sampling. We evaluate MiGrATe on three
challenging domains-word search, molecule optimization, and hypothesis+program
induction on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)-and find that it
consistently outperforms both inference-only and TTT baselines, demonstrating
the potential of online TTT as a solution for complex search tasks without
external supervision.

Conclusion: LLM能够通过多视角推理生成高质量的分子表示，为分子属性预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is a critical challenge with
wide-ranging applications in chemistry, materials science, and drug discovery.
Molecular representation methods, including fingerprints and graph neural
networks (GNNs), achieve state-of-the-art results by effectively deriving
features from molecular structures. However, these methods often overlook
decades of accumulated semantic and contextual knowledge. Recent advancements
in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning abilities and
prior knowledge across scientific domains, leading us to hypothesize that LLMs
can generate rich molecular representations when guided to reason in multiple
perspectives. To address these gaps, we propose $\text{M}^{2}$LLM, a multi-view
framework that integrates three perspectives: the molecular structure view, the
molecular task view, and the molecular rules view. These views are fused
dynamically to adapt to task requirements, and experiments demonstrate that
$\text{M}^{2}$LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks
across classification and regression tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that
representation derived from LLM achieves exceptional performance by leveraging
two core functionalities: the generation of molecular embeddings through their
encoding capabilities and the curation of molecular features through advanced
reasoning processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线类增量学习（OCIL）在非独立同分布数据流中表现更贴近现实场景，但面临严格内存限制下的稳定性与适应性平衡问题。

Method: 采用全局工作空间模型（GWM）作为共享隐式记忆，融合多个学生模型的参数，并通过多级协作蒸馏机制保持知识一致性。

Result: 在三个标准OCIL基准测试中，该方法显著提升了多种OCIL模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了稳定性和适应性，为OCIL提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) enables models to learn continuously
from non-i.i.d. data streams and samples of the data streams can be seen only
once, making it more suitable for real-world scenarios compared to offline
learning. However, OCIL faces two key challenges: maintaining model stability
under strict memory constraints and ensuring adaptability to new tasks. Under
stricter memory constraints, current replay-based methods are less effective.
While ensemble methods improve adaptability (plasticity), they often struggle
with stability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
enhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM)-a shared,
implicit memory that guides the learning of multiple student models. The GWM is
formed by fusing the parameters of all students within each training batch,
capturing the historical learning trajectory and serving as a dynamic anchor
for knowledge consolidation. This fused model is then redistributed
periodically to the students to stabilize learning and promote cross-task
consistency. In addition, we introduce a multi-level collaborative distillation
mechanism. This approach enforces peer-to-peer consistency among students and
preserves historical knowledge by aligning each student with the GWM. As a
result, student models remain adaptable to new tasks while maintaining
previously learned knowledge, striking a better balance between stability and
plasticity. Extensive experiments on three standard OCIL benchmarks show that
our method delivers significant performance improvement for several OCIL models
across various memory budgets.

Motivation: 传统生成式出价仅依赖回报作为最优条件，缺乏个性化结构信息，且扩散模型的逐步生成机制存在时效性风险。

Method: 结合专家轨迹引导和跳步采样策略的条件扩散建模方法。

Result: 离线实验和在线A/B测试显示，该方法在转化率和收入上分别提升了11.29%和12.35%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了自动出价的性能和效率。

Abstract: Auto-bidding is extensively applied in advertising systems, serving a
multitude of advertisers. Generative bidding is gradually gaining traction due
to its robust planning capabilities and generalizability. In contrast to
traditional reinforcement learning-based bidding, generative bidding does not
rely on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) exhibiting superior planning
capabilities in long-horizon scenarios. Conditional diffusion modeling
approaches have demonstrated significant potential in the realm of
auto-bidding. However, relying solely on return as the optimality condition is
weak to guarantee the generation of genuinely optimal decision sequences,
lacking personalized structural information. Moreover, diffusion models' t-step
autoregressive generation mechanism inherently carries timeliness risks. To
address these issues, we propose a novel conditional diffusion modeling method
based on expert trajectory guidance combined with a skip-step sampling strategy
to enhance generation efficiency. We have validated the effectiveness of this
approach through extensive offline experiments and achieved statistically
significant results in online A/B testing, achieving an increase of 11.29% in
conversion and a 12.35% in revenue compared with the baseline.

Method: 提出COGS方法，利用生成式TSP模型采样训练数据，以提高数据覆盖和分布插值能力。

Result: COGS在合成数据集和TSPLib50上表现优于现有神经网络方法，尤其在最坏情况下性能提升显著。

Conclusion: COGS通过生成式采样提升了TSP求解器的分布鲁棒性，适用于现实场景。

Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard combinatorial
optimization task with numerous practical applications. Classic heuristic
solvers can attain near-optimal performance for small problem instances, but
become computationally intractable for larger problems. Real-world logistics
problems such as dynamically re-routing last-mile deliveries demand a solver
with fast inference time, which has led researchers to investigate specialized
neural network solvers. However, neural networks struggle to generalize beyond
the synthetic data they were trained on. In particular, we show that there
exist TSP distributions that are realistic in practice, which also consistently
lead to poor worst-case performance for existing neural approaches. To address
this issue of distribution robustness, we present Combinatorial Optimization
with Generative Sampling (COGS), where training data is sampled from a
generative TSP model. We show that COGS provides better data coverage and
interpolation in the space of TSP training distributions. We also present
TSPLib50, a dataset of realistically distributed TSP samples, which tests
real-world generalization ability without conflating this issue with instance
size. We evaluate our method on various synthetic datasets as well as TSPLib50,
and compare to state-of-the-art neural baselines. We demonstrate that COGS
improves distribution robustness, with most performance gains coming from
worst-case scenarios.

Result: 证明了RF模型在多步和单步生成中均具有多项式离散化复杂度，优于扩散模型。

Conclusion: 本文首次从理论上解释了RF模型在多步和单步生成中的优异表现。

Abstract: Recently, rectified flow (RF)-based models have achieved state-of-the-art
performance in many areas for both the multi-step and one-step generation.
However, only a few theoretical works analyze the discretization complexity of
RF-based models. Existing works either focus on flow-based models with
stochastic samplers or establish complexity results that exhibit exponential
dependence on problem parameters. In this work, under the realistic bounded
support assumption, we prove the first polynomial discretization complexity for
multi-step and one-step RF-based models with a deterministic sampler
simultaneously. For the multi-step setting, inspired by the predictor-corrector
framework of diffusion models, we introduce a Langevin process as a corrector
and show that RF-based models can achieve better polynomial discretization
complexity than diffusion models. To achieve this result, we conduct a detailed
analysis of the RF-based model and explain why it is better than previous
popular models, such as variance preserving (VP) and variance exploding
(VE)-based models. Based on the observation of multi-step RF-based models, we
further provide the first polynomial discretization complexity result for
one-step RF-based models, improving upon prior results for one-step
diffusion-based models. These findings mark the first step toward theoretically
understanding the impressive empirical performance of RF-based models in both
multi-step and one-step generation.

Conclusion: SARM为奖励模型提供了更高的可解释性和灵活性，是改进LLM对齐的有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed across numerous
fields. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages reward
models (RMs) as proxies for human preferences to align LLM behaviors with human
values, making the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of RMs critical
for effective alignment. However, traditional RMs lack interpretability, offer
limited insight into the reasoning behind reward assignments, and are
inflexible toward user preference shifts. While recent multidimensional RMs aim
for improved interpretability, they often fail to provide feature-level
attribution and require costly annotations. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce the Sparse Autoencoder-enhanced Reward Model (\textbf{SARM}), a novel
architecture that integrates a pretrained Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) into a
reward model. SARM maps the hidden activations of LLM-based RM into an
interpretable, sparse, and monosemantic feature space, from which a scalar head
aggregates feature activations to produce transparent and conceptually
meaningful reward scores. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SARM
facilitates direct feature-level attribution of reward assignments, allows
dynamic adjustment to preference shifts, and achieves superior alignment
performance compared to conventional reward models. Our code is available at

Conclusion: DiFac通过差异化因子一致性和辅助信息源的引入，有效解决了半监督学习中的关键问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: In semi-supervised learning (SSL) for enhancing the performance of graph
neural networks (GNNs) with unlabeled data, introducing mutually independent
decision factors for cross-validation is regarded as an effective strategy to
alleviate pseudo-label confirmation bias and training collapse. However,
obtaining such factors is challenging in practice: additional and valid
information sources are inherently scarce, and even when such sources are
available, their independence from the original source cannot be guaranteed. To
address this challenge, In this paper we propose a Differentiated Factor
Consistency Semi-supervised Framework (DiFac), which derives differentiated
factors from a single information source and enforces their consistency. During
pre-training, the model learns to extract these factors; in training, it
iteratively removes samples with conflicting factors and ranks pseudo-labels
based on the shortest stave principle, selecting the top candidate samples to
reduce overconfidence commonly observed in confidence-based or ensemble-based
methods. Our framework can also incorporate additional information sources. In
this work, we leverage the large multimodal language model to introduce latent
textual knowledge as auxiliary decision factors, and we design a accountability
scoring mechanism to mitigate additional erroneous judgments introduced by
these auxiliary factors. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that DiFac consistently improves robustness and generalization in low-label
regimes, outperforming other baseline methods.

Conclusion: TechOps模板可作为实用工具，支持监管合规和负责任的AI开发。

Abstract: Operationalizing the EU AI Act requires clear technical documentation to
ensure AI systems are transparent, traceable, and accountable. Existing
documentation templates for AI systems do not fully cover the entire AI
lifecycle while meeting the technical documentation requirements of the AI Act.
  This paper addresses those shortcomings by introducing open-source templates
and examples for documenting data, models, and applications to provide
sufficient documentation for certifying compliance with the AI Act. These
templates track the system status over the entire AI lifecycle, ensuring
traceability, reproducibility, and compliance with the AI Act. They also
promote discoverability and collaboration, reduce risks, and align with best
practices in AI documentation and governance.
  The templates are evaluated and refined based on user feedback to enable
insights into their usability and implementability. We then validate the
approach on real-world scenarios, providing examples that further guide their
implementation: the data template is followed to document a skin tones dataset
created to support fairness evaluations of downstream computer vision models
and human-centric applications; the model template is followed to document a
neural network for segmenting human silhouettes in photos. The application
template is tested on a system deployed for construction site safety using
real-time video analytics and sensor data. Our results show that TechOps can
serve as a practical tool to enable oversight for regulatory compliance and
responsible AI development.

Conclusion: TempOpt是一种实用且高效的告警关系学习技术，适用于复杂电信网络环境。

Abstract: In a telecommunications network, fault alarms generated by network nodes are
monitored in a Network Operations Centre (NOC) to ensure network availability
and continuous network operations. The monitoring process comprises of tasks
such as active alarms analysis, root alarm identification, and resolution of
the underlying problem. Each network node potentially can generate alarms of
different types, while nodes can be from multiple vendors, a network can have
hundreds of nodes thus resulting in an enormous volume of alarms at any time.
Since network nodes are inter-connected, a single fault in the network would
trigger multiple sequences of alarms across a variety of nodes and from a
monitoring point of view, it is a challenging task for a NOC engineer to be
aware of relations between the various alarms, when trying to identify, for
example, a root alarm on which an action needs to be taken. To effectively
identify root alarms, it is essential to learn relation among the alarms for
accurate and faster resolution. In this work we propose a novel unsupervised
alarm relation learning technique Temporal Optimization (TempOpt) that is
practical and overcomes the limitations of an existing class of alarm
relational learning method-temporal dependency methods. Experiments have been
carried on real-world network datasets, that demonstrate the improved quality
of alarm relations learned by TempOpt as compared to temporal dependency
method.

Result: 在八个真实数据集上，WaveTS系列模型以更少参数实现了SOTA性能，WaveTS-M在多通道数据上表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: WaveTS系列模型高效且性能优越，特别适合多通道时间序列预测。

Abstract: The field of time series forecasting is rapidly advancing, with recent
large-scale Transformers and lightweight Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models
showing strong predictive performance. However, conventional Transformer models
are often hindered by their large number of parameters and their limited
ability to capture non-stationary features in data through smoothing.
Similarly, MLP models struggle to manage multi-channel dependencies
effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel, lightweight time
series prediction model, WaveTS-B. This model combines wavelet transforms with
MLP to capture both periodic and non-stationary characteristics of data in the
wavelet domain. Building on this foundation, we propose a channel clustering
strategy that incorporates a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, utilizing a
gating mechanism and expert network to handle multi-channel dependencies
efficiently. We propose WaveTS-M, an advanced model tailored for multi-channel
time series prediction. Empirical evaluation across eight real-world time
series datasets demonstrates that our WaveTS series models achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significantly fewer parameters.
Notably, WaveTS-M shows substantial improvements on multi-channel datasets,
highlighting its effectiveness.

Abstract: Generative machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for design
representation and exploration. However, its application is often constrained
by the need for large datasets of existing designs and the lack of
interpretability about what features drive optimality. To address these
challenges, we introduce a systematic framework for constructing training
datasets tailored to generative models and demonstrate how these models can be
leveraged for interpretable design. The novelty of this work is twofold: (i) we
present a systematic framework for generating archetypes with internally
homogeneous but mutually heterogeneous inputs that can be used to generate a
training dataset, and (ii) we show how integrating generative models with
Bayesian optimization can enhance the interpretability of the latent space of
admissible designs. These findings are validated by using the framework to
design a flow battery manifold, demonstrating that it effectively captures the
space of feasible designs, including novel configurations while enabling
efficient exploration. This work broadens the applicability of generative
machine-learning models in system designs by enhancing quality and reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中的LLM缺乏内置机制满足GDPR等法规的‘被遗忘权’，且现有框架无法选择性删除客户端数据。

Method: 提出Oblivionis框架，将联邦学习和数据删除作为双重优化目标，整合多种算法进行评估。

Result: Oblivionis在删除效果和模型性能间取得平衡，优于本地训练。

Conclusion: Oblivionis为联邦LLM的数据删除提供了有效解决方案，为未来发展指明方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly leverage Federated Learning (FL) to
utilize private, task-specific datasets for fine-tuning while preserving data
privacy. However, while federated LLM frameworks effectively enable
collaborative training without raw data sharing, they critically lack built-in
mechanisms for regulatory compliance like GDPR's right to be forgotten.
Integrating private data heightens concerns over data quality and long-term
governance, yet existing distributed training frameworks offer no principled
way to selectively remove specific client contributions post-training. Due to
distributed data silos, stringent privacy constraints, and the intricacies of
interdependent model aggregation, federated LLM unlearning is significantly
more complex than centralized LLM unlearning. To address this gap, we introduce
Oblivionis, a lightweight learning and unlearning framework that enables
clients to selectively remove specific private data during federated LLM
training, enhancing trustworthiness and regulatory compliance. By unifying FL
and unlearning as a dual optimization objective, we incorporate 6 FL and 5
unlearning algorithms for comprehensive evaluation and comparative analysis,
establishing a robust pipeline for federated LLM unlearning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Oblivionis outperforms local training, achieving a
robust balance between forgetting efficacy and model utility, with
cross-algorithm comparisons providing clear directions for future LLM
development.

Abstract: Building modern deep learning systems that are not just effective but also
efficient requires rethinking established paradigms for model training and
neural architecture design. Instead of adapting highly overparameterized
networks and subsequently applying model compression techniques to reduce
resource consumption, a new class of high-performing networks skips the need
for expensive parameter updates, while requiring only a fraction of parameters,
making them highly scalable. The Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis posits that
within randomly initialized, sufficiently overparameterized neural networks,
there exist subnetworks that can match the accuracy of the trained original
model-without any training. This work explores the usage of genetic algorithms
for identifying these strong lottery ticket subnetworks. We find that for
instances of binary and multi-class classification tasks, our approach achieves
better accuracies and sparsity levels than the current state-of-the-art without
requiring any gradient information. In addition, we provide justification for
the need for appropriate evaluation metrics when scaling to more complex
network architectures and learning tasks.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在贝叶斯神经网络（BNNs）中通过函数空间先验优化训练激活函数，以实现更直观的模型输出和更好的正则化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 函数空间先验能更直观地将信念嵌入模型输出，但将其应用于BNNs具有挑战性。

Method: 通过优化技术研究可训练激活函数（如Pade函数和分段线性函数）以适应复杂先验和目标函数分布。

Result: 实验表明，即使单层宽隐层的BNNs，配备灵活的可训练激活函数，也能有效实现目标函数空间先验。

Conclusion: 灵活的可训练激活函数是解决BNNs中函数空间先验问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Function-space priors in Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide a more
intuitive approach to embedding beliefs directly into the model's output,
thereby enhancing regularization, uncertainty quantification, and risk-aware
decision-making. However, imposing function-space priors on BNNs is
challenging. We address this task through optimization techniques that explore
how trainable activations can accommodate higher-complexity priors and match
intricate target function distributions. We investigate flexible activation
models, including Pade functions and piecewise linear functions, and discuss
the learning challenges related to identifiability, loss construction, and
symmetries. Our empirical findings indicate that even BNNs with a single wide
hidden layer when equipped with flexible trainable activation, can effectively
achieve desired function-space priors.

Conclusion: 采用提出的评估原则可以增强对因果机器学习方法的信任，推动其广泛应用。

Abstract: Causal machine learning has the potential to revolutionize decision-making by
combining the predictive power of machine learning algorithms with the theory
of causal inference. However, these methods remain underutilized by the broader
machine learning community, in part because current empirical evaluations do
not permit assessment of their reliability and robustness, undermining their
practical utility. Specifically, one of the principal criticisms made by the
community is the extensive use of synthetic experiments. We argue, on the
contrary, that synthetic experiments are essential and necessary to precisely
assess and understand the capabilities of causal machine learning methods. To
substantiate our position, we critically review the current evaluation
practices, spotlight their shortcomings, and propose a set of principles for
conducting rigorous empirical analyses with synthetic data. Adopting the
proposed principles will enable comprehensive evaluations that build trust in
causal machine learning methods, driving their broader adoption and impactful
real-world use.

Result: 实验表明APRNet优于现有方法。

Conclusion: APRNet通过解耦振幅和相位，显著提升时间序列预测能力。

Abstract: Deep learning-based time series forecasting has found widespread
applications. Recently, converting time series data into the frequency domain
for forecasting has become popular for accurately exploring periodic patterns.
However, existing methods often cannot effectively explore stationary
information from complex intertwined frequency components. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective Amplitude-Phase Reconstruct Network (APRNet)
that models the inter-relationships of amplitude and phase, which prevents the
amplitude and phase from being constrained by different physical quantities,
thereby decoupling the distinct characteristics of signals for capturing
stationary information. Specifically, we represent the multivariate time series
input across sequence and channel dimensions, highlighting the correlation
between amplitude and phase at multiple interaction frequencies. We propose a
novel Kolmogorov-Arnold-Network-based Local Correlation (KLC) module to
adaptively fit local functions using univariate functions, enabling more
flexible characterization of stationary features across different amplitudes
and phases. This significantly enhances the model's capability to capture
time-varying patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
APRNet against the state-of-the-arts (SOTAs).

Motivation: 研究持续学习模型在对抗攻击下的安全性，尤其是阶段转移攻击的脆弱性。

Method: 通过模型相似性和鲁棒性退化分析阶段转移攻击的影响。

Result: 发现持续学习方法对阶段转移攻击高度敏感，现有防御方法效果不佳。

Conclusion: 持续学习模型在对抗攻击下存在严重安全问题，需进一步研究防御方法。

Abstract: Class-incremental continual learning addresses catastrophic forgetting by
enabling classification models to preserve knowledge of previously learned
classes while acquiring new ones. However, the vulnerability of the models
against adversarial attacks during this process has not been investigated
sufficiently. In this paper, we present the first exploration of vulnerability
to stage-transferred attacks, i.e., an adversarial example generated using the
model in an earlier stage is used to attack the model in a later stage. Our
findings reveal that continual learning methods are highly susceptible to these
attacks, raising a serious security issue. We explain this phenomenon through
model similarity between stages and gradual robustness degradation.
Additionally, we find that existing adversarial training-based defense methods
are not sufficiently effective to stage-transferred attacks. Codes are
available at https://github.com/mcml-official/CSAT.

Conclusion: LNN-PINN为复杂科学和工程问题提供了一种简洁有效的架构改进方案。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have attracted considerable
attention for their ability to integrate partial differential equation priors
into deep learning frameworks; however, they often exhibit limited predictive
accuracy when applied to complex problems. To address this issue, we propose
LNN-PINN, a physics-informed neural network framework that incorporates a
liquid residual gating architecture while preserving the original physics
modeling and optimization pipeline to improve predictive accuracy. The method
introduces a lightweight gating mechanism solely within the hidden-layer
mapping, keeping the sampling strategy, loss composition, and hyperparameter
settings unchanged to ensure that improvements arise purely from architectural
refinement. Across four benchmark problems, LNN-PINN consistently reduced RMSE
and MAE under identical training conditions, with absolute error plots further
confirming its accuracy gains. Moreover, the framework demonstrates strong
adaptability and stability across varying dimensions, boundary conditions, and
operator characteristics. In summary, LNN-PINN offers a concise and effective
architectural enhancement for improving the predictive accuracy of
physics-informed neural networks in complex scientific and engineering
problems.

Motivation: 由于交通传感器的高成本和维护难度，许多区域缺乏历史交通数据，现有模型难以泛化。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: GenCast结合了物理信息神经网络、外部信号学习模块和空间分组模块，以补偿缺失数据并提升泛化能力。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，GenCast显著降低了预测误差。

Conclusion: GenCast通过整合外部知识和物理原理，有效提升了无传感器区域的交通预测能力。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation systems.
Accurate forecasting relies on continuous observations collected by traffic
sensors. However, due to high deployment and maintenance costs, not all regions
are equipped with such sensors. This paper aims to forecast for regions without
traffic sensors, where the lack of historical traffic observations challenges
the generalisability of existing models. We propose a model named GenCast, the
core idea of which is to exploit external knowledge to compensate for the
missing observations and to enhance generalisation. We integrate
physics-informed neural networks into GenCast, enabling physical principles to
regularise the learning process. We introduce an external signal learning
module to explore correlations between traffic states and external signals such
as weather conditions, further improving model generalisability. Additionally,
we design a spatial grouping module to filter localised features that hinder
model generalisability. Extensive experiments show that GenCast consistently
reduces forecasting errors on multiple real-world datasets.

Motivation: 传统图分类方法依赖静态邻域信息，无法动态适应顶点间的上下文关系。GRAVITY旨在通过模拟物理系统中的自组织行为，提升分类的准确性和语义一致性。

Method: GRAVITY将顶点建模为通过结构邻近性和属性相似性学习的相互作用力，形成潜在势场，使顶点动态调整位置。通过自适应调制感受野，实现动态信息聚合。

Result: 实验表明，GRAVITY在转导和归纳顶点分类任务中均表现优异，生成的嵌入具有竞争力。

Conclusion: GRAVITY通过动态力场驱动的顶点组织，显著提升了分类性能，为图表示学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: In the quest of accurate vertex classification, we introduce GRAVITY
(Graph-based Representation leArning via Vertices Interaction TopologY), a
framework inspired by physical systems where objects self-organize under
attractive forces. GRAVITY models each vertex as exerting influence through
learned interactions shaped by structural proximity and attribute similarity.
These interactions induce a latent potential field in which vertices move
toward energy efficient positions, coalescing around class-consistent
attractors and distancing themselves from unrelated groups. Unlike traditional
message-passing schemes with static neighborhoods, GRAVITY adaptively modulates
the receptive field of each vertex based on a learned force function, enabling
dynamic aggregation driven by context. This field-driven organization sharpens
class boundaries and promotes semantic coherence within latent clusters.
Experiments on real-world benchmarks show that GRAVITY yields competitive
embeddings, excelling in both transductive and inductive vertex classification
tasks.

Conclusion: 频域信息在时间序列对抗攻击中具有重要价值，未来需进一步研究。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have made significant progress in time series
forecasting. However, a key limitation of deep learning models is their
susceptibility to adversarial attacks, which has not been studied enough in the
context of time series prediction. In contrast to areas such as computer
vision, where adversarial robustness has been extensively studied, frequency
domain features of time series data play an important role in the prediction
task but have not been sufficiently explored in terms of adversarial attacks.
This paper proposes a time series prediction attack algorithm based on
frequency domain loss. Specifically, we adapt an attack method originally
designed for classification tasks to the prediction field and optimize the
adversarial samples using both time-domain and frequency-domain losses. To the
best of our knowledge, there is no relevant research on using frequency
information for time-series adversarial attacks. Our experimental results show
that these current time series prediction models are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, and our approach achieves excellent performance on major time series
forecasting datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 注意力机制在Transformer中提供了可解释的信号，但其权重并未直接决定模型输出。研究旨在探索如何利用这些权重信息，补充现有的可解释性技术。

Method: 提出了两种新方法：1）将注意力权重整合到Shapley值分解中，用于局部解释；2）将注意力权重与概念激活向量结合，用于全局解释。

Result: 实验表明，注意力权重可以有效地整合到可解释性框架中，丰富了Transformer的解释能力。

Conclusion: 注意力权重能够为Transformer模型提供有意义的解释，补充了现有的可解释性方法。

Abstract: The attention mechanism lies at the core of the transformer architecture,
providing an interpretable model-internal signal that has motivated a growing
interest in attention-based model explanations. Although attention weights do
not directly determine model outputs, they reflect patterns of token influence
that can inform and complement established explainability techniques. This work
studies the potential of utilising the information encoded in attention weights
to provide meaningful model explanations by integrating them into explainable
AI (XAI) frameworks that target fundamentally different aspects of model
behaviour. To this end, we develop two novel explanation methods applicable to
both natural language processing and computer vision tasks. The first
integrates attention weights into the Shapley value decomposition by redefining
the characteristic function in terms of pairwise token interactions via
attention weights, thus adapting this widely used game-theoretic solution
concept to provide attention-driven attributions for local explanations. The
second incorporates attention weights into token-level directional derivatives
defined through concept activation vectors to measure concept sensitivity for
global explanations. Our empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks and in a
comparison study with widely used explanation methods show that attention
weights can be meaningfully incorporated into the studied XAI frameworks,
highlighting their value in enriching transformer explainability.

Motivation: 解决边缘智能系统中分层推理学习（HIL）的核心挑战，即动态数据分布和卸载成本下本地推理错误的概率估计问题。

Result: 实验证明这两种策略实现了O(log T)的最优遗憾，显著优于现有方法的O(T^{2/3})，且HI-LCB-lite计算复杂度低至O(1)。

Conclusion: 所提策略在真实数据集上表现优异，特别适合资源受限设备，为边缘智能系统提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: This work focuses on Hierarchical Inference (HI) in edge intelligence
systems, where a compact Local-ML model on an end-device works in conjunction
with a high-accuracy Remote-ML model on an edge-server. HI aims to reduce
latency, improve accuracy, and lower bandwidth usage by first using the
Local-ML model for inference and offloading to the Remote-ML only when the
local inference is likely incorrect. A critical challenge in HI is estimating
the likelihood of the local inference being incorrect, especially when data
distributions and offloading costs change over time -- a problem we term
Hierarchical Inference Learning (HIL). We introduce a novel approach to HIL by
modeling the probability of correct inference by the Local-ML as an increasing
function of the model's confidence measure, a structure motivated by empirical
observations but previously unexploited. We propose two policies, HI-LCB and
HI-LCB-lite, based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) framework. We
demonstrate that both policies achieve order-optimal regret of $O(\log T)$, a
significant improvement over existing HIL policies with $O(T^{2/3})$ regret
guarantees. Notably, HI-LCB-lite has an $O(1)$ per-sample computational
complexity, making it well-suited for deployment on devices with severe
resource limitations. Simulations using real-world datasets confirm that our
policies outperform existing state-of-the-art HIL methods.

Abstract: Designing mechanical mechanisms to trace specific paths is a classic yet
notoriously difficult engineering problem, characterized by a vast and complex
search space of discrete topologies and continuous parameters. We introduce
MechaFormer, a Transformer-based model that tackles this challenge by treating
mechanism design as a conditional sequence generation task. Our model learns to
translate a target curve into a domain-specific language (DSL) string,
simultaneously determining the mechanism's topology and geometric parameters in
a single, unified process. MechaFormer significantly outperforms existing
baselines, achieving state-of-the-art path-matching accuracy and generating a
wide diversity of novel and valid designs. We demonstrate a suite of sampling
strategies that can dramatically improve solution quality and offer designers
valuable flexibility. Furthermore, we show that the high-quality outputs from
MechaFormer serve as excellent starting points for traditional optimizers,
creating a hybrid approach that finds superior solutions with remarkable
efficiency.

<details>

Motivation: 现实中的关系数据（如社交网络或生物模型）通常不完整，现有方法（模型堆叠或神经网络）在无节点属性的网络中表现不一，缺乏系统比较。

Method: 使用550个真实网络基准，比较4种堆叠算法、42种拓扑链接预测器和2种图神经网络算法，分析性能与网络特性的关系。

Result: 无单一算法在所有网络中表现最佳，堆叠随机森林在AUC上优于或与图神经网络在Top-k上竞争。网络特性（如度分布）显著影响性能。

Conclusion: 提出的元学习算法通过选择最佳算法优化预测，优于现有方法且可扩展到大网络。

Abstract: Relational data are ubiquitous in real-world data applications, e.g., in
social network analysis or biological modeling, but networks are nearly always
incompletely observed. The state-of-the-art for predicting missing links in the
hard case of a network without node attributes uses model stacking or neural
network techniques. It remains unknown which approach is best, and whether or
how the best choice of algorithm depends on the input network's
characteristics. We answer these questions systematically using a large,
structurally diverse benchmark of 550 real-world networks under two standard
accuracy measures (AUC and Top-k), comparing four stacking algorithms with 42
topological link predictors, two of which we introduce here, and two graph
neural network algorithms. We show that no algorithm is best across all input
networks, all algorithms perform well on most social networks, and few perform
well on economic and biological networks. Overall, model stacking with a random
forest is both highly scalable and surpasses on AUC or is competitive with
graph neural networks on Top-k accuracy. But, algorithm performance depends
strongly on network characteristics like the degree distribution, triangle
density, and degree assortativity. We introduce a meta-learning algorithm that
exploits this variability to optimize link predictions for individual networks
by selecting the best algorithm to apply, which we show outperforms all
state-of-the-art algorithms and scales to large networks.

Result: 方法能更有效地评估LLM性能，数据需求低于当前标准实践。

Conclusion: 主动测试可扩展至大模型评估，显著降低计算和数据成本。

Abstract: Active testing enables label-efficient evaluation of models through careful
data acquisition. However, its significant computational costs have previously
undermined its use for large models. We show how it can be successfully scaled
up to the evaluation of large language models (LLMs). In particular we show
that the surrogate model used to guide data acquisition can be constructed
cheaply using in-context learning, does not require updating within an
active-testing loop, and can be smaller than the target model. We even find we
can make good data-acquisition decisions without computing predictions with the
target model and further introduce a single-run error estimator to asses how
well active testing is working on the fly. We find that our approach is able to
more effectively evaluate LLM performance with less data than current standard
practices.

<details>

Motivation: 为了更可解释且减少混淆地评估GNN在手性预测任务中的性能，需要一种能够生成具有特定几何和拓扑特征的合成图数据的工具。

Method: Chi-Geometry生成包含一个手性中心（标记为R或S）的合成图样本，其他节点标记为N/A。数据集用于评估GNN的节点分类能力。

Result: 通过Chi-Geometry生成的基准数据集，设计了两款新GNN架构：一款通过全连接提高准确性但计算成本高，另一款通过虚拟节点保持线性计算成本且性能接近SOTA。

Conclusion: Chi-Geometry为GNN在手性预测任务中的性能评估提供了有效工具，并指导了高效且准确的新架构设计。

Abstract: We introduce Chi-Geometry - a library that generates graph data for testing
and benchmarking GNNs' ability to predict chirality. Chi-Geometry generates
synthetic graph samples with (i) user-specified geometric and topological
traits to isolate certain types of samples and (ii) randomized node positions
and species to minimize extraneous correlations. Each generated graph contains
exactly one chiral center labeled either R or S, while all other nodes are
labeled N/A (non-chiral). The generated samples are then combined into a
cohesive dataset that can be used to assess a GNN's ability to predict
chirality as a node classification task. Chi-Geometry allows more interpretable
and less confounding benchmarking of GNNs for prediction of chirality in the
graph samples which can guide the design of new GNN architectures with improved
predictive performance. We illustrate Chi-Geometry's efficacy by using it to
generate synthetic datasets for benchmarking various state-of-the-art (SOTA)
GNN architectures. The conclusions of these benchmarking results guided our
design of two new GNN architectures. The first GNN architecture established
all-to-all connections in the graph to accurately predict chirality across all
challenging configurations where previously tested SOTA models failed, but at a
computational cost (both for training and inference) that grows quadratically
with the number of graph nodes. The second GNN architecture avoids all-to-all
connections by introducing a virtual node in the original graph structure of
the data, which restores the linear scaling of training and inference
computational cost with respect to the number of nodes in the graph, while
still ensuring competitive accuracy in detecting chirality with respect to SOTA
GNN architectures.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合自然语言推理和形式化语言的方法（GF-Reasoner），通过链式思维（CoT）与形式化语言交替生成可执行的几何求解程序，显著提升了几何问题求解的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在几何问题求解（GPS）中表现不佳，主要因为其不可靠的图表解释和纯自然语言推理。现有方法通过生成可直接执行的程序来弥补，但缺乏中间推理过程，导致决策不透明且易出错。

Method: 提出了一种新方法，将链式思维（CoT）与形式化语言结合，交替生成自然语言推理和可执行代码。通过监督微调（11K合成数据集）和基于结果的强化学习联合优化推理过程和程序生成。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-7B基础上构建的GF-Reasoner模型，在标准GPS基准测试中提升了15%的准确率，优于同类7B模型和更大的72B模型。生成的推理痕迹更短且清晰。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合自然语言推理和形式化语言，显著提升了几何问题求解的准确性和可解释性，并为未来研究提供了设计选择的详细分析。

Abstract: Large vision language models exhibit notable limitations on Geometry Problem
Solving (GPS) because of their unreliable diagram interpretation and pure
natural-language reasoning. A recent line of work mitigates this by using
symbolic solvers: the model directly generates a formal program that a geometry
solver can execute. However, this direct program generation lacks intermediate
reasoning, making the decision process opaque and prone to errors. In this
work, we explore a new approach that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with
formal language. The model interleaves natural language reasoning with
incremental emission of solver-executable code, producing a hybrid reasoning
trace in which critical derivations are expressed in formal language. To teach
this behavior at scale, we combine (1) supervised fine-tuning on an 11K newly
developed synthetic dataset with interleaved natural language reasoning and
automatic formalization, and (2) solver-in-the-loop reinforcement learning that
jointly optimizes both the CoT narrative and the resulting program through
outcome-based rewards. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, our new model, named
GF-Reasoner, achieves up to 15% accuracy improvements on standard GPS
benchmarks, surpassing both 7B-scale peers and the much larger model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B. By exploiting high-order geometric knowledge and offloading
symbolic computation to the solver, the generated reasoning traces are
noticeably shorter and cleaner. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive
analysis of method design choices (e.g., reasoning paradigms, data synthesis,
training epochs, etc.), providing actionable insights for future research.

### [236] [Towards Universal Neural Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09100)
*Shreyas Bhat Brahmavar,Yang Li,Junier Oliva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASPIRE是一种通用神经推理模型，用于处理异构结构化数据的语义推理和预测，支持跨数据集的特征依赖学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据通常具有多样化和不连贯的形式（如不同模式、不一致语义和无固定特征顺序），这使得构建通用模型以跨数据集利用信息具有挑战性。

Method: ASPIRE结合了基于集合的置换不变Transformer和语义接地模块，利用自然语言描述、数据集元数据和上下文示例学习跨数据集特征依赖。

Result: ASPIRE在多样化基准测试中表现优异，支持成本感知的主动特征获取，并在未见数据集上无需额外调优即可泛化。

Conclusion: ASPIRE是实现真正通用的、语义感知的结构化数据推理的重要一步。

Abstract: Real-world data often appears in diverse, disjoint forms -- with varying
schemas, inconsistent semantics, and no fixed feature ordering -- making it
challenging to build general-purpose models that can leverage information
across datasets. We introduce ASPIRE, Arbitrary Set-based Permutation-Invariant
Reasoning Engine, a Universal Neural Inference model for semantic reasoning and
prediction over heterogeneous structured data. ASPIRE combines a
permutation-invariant, set-based Transformer with a semantic grounding module
that incorporates natural language descriptions, dataset metadata, and
in-context examples to learn cross-dataset feature dependencies. This
architecture allows ASPIRE to ingest arbitrary sets of feature--value pairs and
support examples, align semantics across disjoint tables, and make predictions
for any specified target. Once trained, ASPIRE generalizes to new inference
tasks without additional tuning. In addition to delivering strong results
across diverse benchmarks, ASPIRE naturally supports cost-aware active feature
acquisition in an open-world setting, selecting informative features under
test-time budget constraints for an arbitrary unseen dataset. These
capabilities position ASPIRE as a step toward truly universal, semantics-aware
inference over structured data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于掩码的分类器校准方法MaC-Cal，通过随机稀疏性提升置信度与准确性的对齐，解决了深度神经网络校准不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在安全关键场景中因校准不足可能导致严重后果，现有方法多忽略欠置信问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练方案和自适应稀疏性，动态调整掩码保留率以优化置信度与准确性对齐。

Result: 实验表明MaC-Cal在校准性能和数据损坏下的鲁棒性上表现优异。

Conclusion: MaC-Cal为深度神经网络提供了可靠置信度估计的实用解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown competitive results
in many fields. Despite this success, they often suffer from poor calibration,
especially in safety-critical scenarios such as autonomous driving and
healthcare, where unreliable confidence estimates can lead to serious
consequences. Recent studies have focused on improving calibration by modifying
the classifier, yet such efforts remain limited. Moreover, most existing
approaches overlook calibration errors caused by underconfidence, which can be
equally detrimental. To address these challenges, we propose MaC-Cal, a novel
mask-based classifier calibration method that leverages stochastic sparsity to
enhance the alignment between confidence and accuracy. MaC-Cal adopts a
two-stage training scheme with adaptive sparsity, dynamically adjusting mask
retention rates based on the deviation between confidence and accuracy.
Extensive experiments show that MaC-Cal achieves superior calibration
performance and robustness under data corruption, offering a practical and
effective solution for reliable confidence estimation in DNNs.

TL;DR: 提出SSPO方法解决视频配音中源语言与目标语言时长不匹配问题，优化音频-视频同步。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频配音中语言信息密度差异导致时长不匹配，影响观看体验。

Method: 采用分段监督偏好优化（SSPO），结合分段采样策略和细粒度损失函数。

Result: 实验表明SSPO在时长对齐任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: SSPO能有效解决视频配音中的时长对齐问题。

Abstract: Video dubbing aims to translate original speech in visual media programs from
the source language to the target language, relying on neural machine
translation and text-to-speech technologies. Due to varying information
densities across languages, target speech often mismatches the source speech
duration, causing audio-video synchronization issues that significantly impact
viewer experience. In this study, we approach duration alignment in LLM-based
video dubbing machine translation as a preference optimization problem. We
propose the Segment Supervised Preference Optimization (SSPO) method, which
employs a segment-wise sampling strategy and fine-grained loss to mitigate
duration mismatches between source and target lines. Experimental results
demonstrate that SSPO achieves superior performance in duration alignment
tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种归一化技术，通过将ASR模型的内部特征表示与干净参考通道对齐，以减少不同录音通道对性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的ASR模型在不同录音通道下性能下降，传统归因于训练与测试语料不匹配，但本研究认为通道差异会从根本上损害ASR性能。

Method: 提出一种归一化技术，通过将ASR模型的内部特征表示与干净参考通道对齐，以减少通道变化的影响。

Result: 该方法显著提升了ASR在未见通道和语言上的性能，展示了其跨通道和跨语言的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 归一化技术有效缓解了录音通道差异对ASR性能的负面影响，具有跨通道和跨语言的泛化潜力。

Abstract: Pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) models have demonstrated
strong performance on a variety of tasks. However, their performance can
degrade substantially when the input audio comes from different recording
channels. While previous studies have demonstrated this phenomenon, it is often
attributed to the mismatch between training and testing corpora. This study
argues that variations in speech characteristics caused by different recording
channels can fundamentally harm ASR performance. To address this limitation, we
propose a normalization technique designed to mitigate the impact of channel
variation by aligning internal feature representations in the ASR model with
those derived from a clean reference channel. This approach significantly
improves ASR performance on previously unseen channels and languages,
highlighting its ability to generalize across channel and language differences.

Motivation: 研究多目标后门攻击在说话人识别中的可行性，模拟更真实的攻击条件。

Method: 使用位置无关的点击声作为触发器，调整信噪比以平衡隐蔽性和攻击效果，并在说话人验证任务中扩展攻击。

Result: 攻击成功率高达95.04%，在说话人验证任务中，当目标和注册说话人高度相似时，成功率可达90%。

Conclusion: 多目标后门攻击在说话人识别中具有高成功率，且隐蔽性与攻击效果之间存在权衡。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a multi-target backdoor attack against speaker
identification using position-independent clicking sounds as triggers. Unlike
previous single-target approaches, our method targets up to 50 speakers
simultaneously, achieving success rates of up to 95.04%. To simulate more
realistic attack conditions, we vary the signal-to-noise ratio between speech
and trigger, demonstrating a trade-off between stealth and effectiveness. We
further extend the attack to the speaker verification task by selecting the
most similar training speaker - based on cosine similarity - as the target. The
attack is most effective when target and enrolled speaker pairs are highly
similar, reaching success rates of up to 90% in such cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域对AI的需求日益增长，但数据稀缺问题突出，尤其是在疫情期间。合成数据被用于缓解这一问题，以提高COVID-19咳嗽检测模型的准确性。

Method: 使用Coughvid数据集训练CNN作为基线模型，然后通过ACGAN生成合成咳嗽的Mel频谱图，用于数据增强，最终提升CNN的分类准确率。

Result: 基线CNN模型的测试准确率为72%，通过合成数据增强后，准确率提升至75%。

Conclusion: 合成数据在医疗AI中具有潜力，但需注意训练中的不一致性，并采取措施应对。

Abstract: One of the fastest-growing domains in AI is healthcare. Given its importance,
it has been the interest of many researchers to deploy ML models into the
ever-demanding healthcare domain to aid doctors and increase accessibility.
Delivering reliable models, however, demands a sizable amount of data, and the
recent COVID-19 pandemic served as a reminder of the rampant and scary nature
of healthcare that makes training models difficult. To alleviate such scarcity,
many published works attempted to synthesize radiological cough data to train
better COVID-19 detection models on the respective radiological data. To
accommodate the time sensitivity expected during a pandemic, this work focuses
on detecting COVID-19 through coughs using synthetic data to improve the
accuracy of the classifier. The work begins by training a CNN on a balanced
subset of the Coughvid dataset, establishing a baseline classification test
accuracy of 72%. The paper demonstrates how an Auxiliary Classification GAN
(ACGAN) may be trained to conditionally generate novel synthetic Mel
Spectrograms of both healthy and COVID-19 coughs. These coughs are used to
augment the training dataset of the CNN classifier, allowing it to reach a new
test accuracy of 75%. The work highlights the expected messiness and
inconsistency in training and offers insights into detecting and handling such
shortcomings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将MOS预测视为回归问题，但忽略了感知判断的相对性，导致评估不准确。

Method: 提出QAMRO框架，结合回归目标和自适应边际排序优化，利用预训练音频-文本模型（如CLAP和Audiobox-Aesthetics）进行训练。

Result: 在AudioMOS Challenge 2025数据集上表现优异，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: QAMRO框架在多维度上更符合人类评估，为音频生成系统评估提供了更准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Evaluating audio generation systems, including text-to-music (TTM),
text-to-speech (TTS), and text-to-audio (TTA), remains challenging due to the
subjective and multi-dimensional nature of human perception. Existing methods
treat mean opinion score (MOS) prediction as a regression problem, but standard
regression losses overlook the relativity of perceptual judgments. To address
this limitation, we introduce QAMRO, a novel Quality-aware Adaptive Margin
Ranking Optimization framework that seamlessly integrates regression objectives
from different perspectives, aiming to highlight perceptual differences and
prioritize accurate ratings. Our framework leverages pre-trained audio-text
models such as CLAP and Audiobox-Aesthetics, and is trained exclusively on the
official AudioMOS Challenge 2025 dataset. It demonstrates superior alignment
with human evaluations across all dimensions, significantly outperforming
robust baseline models.

Motivation: 研究生成式AI音乐制作系统如何被宣传为民主化工具，但实际可能只是市场宣传，而非真正推动包容性。

Method: 结合自民族志和数字民族志，分析四种公开AI音乐系统的宣传与用户反馈，对比其功能与宣传的差异。

Result: 发现开发者和用户共享一种个人主义、全球主义和技术自由主义的意识形态，这种意识形态模糊了个人责任，并重塑了音乐实践。

Conclusion: 生成式AI音乐系统的民主化宣传掩盖了其背后的意识形态，实际功能与宣传存在显著差异。

Abstract: AI systems for music generation are increasingly common and easy to use,
granting people without any musical background the ability to create music.
Because of this, generative-AI has been marketed and celebrated as a means of
democratizing music making. However, inclusivity often functions as marketable
rhetoric rather than a genuine guiding principle in these industry settings. In
this paper, we look at four generative-AI music making systems available to the
public as of mid-2025 (AIVA, Stable Audio, Suno, and Udio) and track how they
are rhetoricized by their developers, and received by users. Our aim is to
investigate ideologies that are driving the early-stage development and
adoption of generative-AI in music making, with a particular focus on
democratization. A combination of autoethnography and digital ethnography is
used to examine patterns and incongruities in rhetoric when positioned against
product functionality. The results are then collated to develop a nuanced,
contextual discussion. The shared ideology we map between producers and
consumers is individualist, globalist, techno-liberal, and ethically evasive.
It is a 'total ideology' which obfuscates individual responsibility, and
through which the nature of music and musical practice is transfigured to suit
generative outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人工智能模型的计算瓶颈在于大规模矩阵乘法，而现有内存计算架构存在性能与能效问题。

Method: OISMA将普通内存读取操作转换为原位随机乘法操作，并通过累加外围电路实现矩阵乘法功能。

Result: 在4x4至512x512矩阵乘法测试中，OISMA的平均相对Frobenius误差显著降低，能效和面积效率优于传统架构。

Conclusion: OISMA在能效和面积效率上具有显著优势，且随着技术节点的缩小，其性能提升潜力巨大。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models are currently driven by a significant
up-scaling of their complexity, with massive matrix multiplication workloads
representing the major computational bottleneck. In-memory computing
architectures are proposed to avoid the Von Neumann bottleneck. However, both
digital/binary-based and analogue in-memory computing architectures suffer from
various limitations, which significantly degrade the performance and energy
efficiency gains. This work proposes OISMA, a novel in-memory computing
architecture that utilizes the computational simplicity of a quasi-stochastic
computing domain (Bent-Pyramid system), while keeping the same efficiency,
scalability, and productivity of digital memories. OISMA converts normal memory
read operations into in-situ stochastic multiplication operations with a
negligible cost. An accumulation periphery then accumulates the output
multiplication bitstreams, achieving the matrix multiplication functionality.
Extensive matrix multiplication benchmarking was conducted to analyze the
accuracy of the Bent-Pyramid system, using matrix dimensions ranging from 4x4
to 512x512. The accuracy results show a significant decrease in the average
relative Frobenius error, from 9.42% (for 4x4) to 1.81% (for 512x512), compared
to 64-bit double precision floating-point format. A 1T1R OISMA array of 4 KB
capacity was implemented using a commercial 180nm technology node and in-house
RRAM technology. At 50 MHz, OISMA achieves 0.891 TOPS/W and 3.98 GOPS/mm2 for
energy and area efficiency, respectively, occupying an effective computing area
of 0.804241 mm2. Scaling OISMA from 180nm to 22nm technology shows a
significant improvement of two orders of magnitude in energy efficiency and one
order of magnitude in area efficiency, compared to dense matrix multiplication
in-memory computing architectures.

Conclusion: 提出了一种完全可解释的数据驱动核质量模型，结合了AI和物理模型的优势。

Abstract: Obtaining high-precision predictions of nuclear masses, or equivalently
nuclear binding energies, $E_b$, remains an important goal in nuclear-physics
research. Recently, many AI-based tools have shown promising results on this
task, some achieving precision that surpasses the best physics models. However,
the utility of these AI models remains in question given that predictions are
only useful where measurements do not exist, which inherently requires
extrapolation away from the training (and testing) samples. Since AI models are
largely black boxes, the reliability of such an extrapolation is difficult to
assess. We present an AI model that not only achieves cutting-edge precision
for $E_b$, but does so in an interpretable manner. For example, we find (and
explain why) that the most important dimensions of its internal representation
form a double helix, where the analog of the hydrogen bonds in DNA here link
the number of protons and neutrons found in the most stable nucleus of each
isotopic chain. Furthermore, we show that the AI prediction of $E_b$ can be
factorized and ordered hierarchically, with the most important terms
corresponding to well-known symbolic models (such as the famous liquid drop).
Remarkably, the improvement of the AI model over symbolic ones can almost
entirely be attributed to an observation made by Jaffe in 1969. The end result
is a fully interpretable data-driven model of nuclear masses.

Conclusion: 约束性PSLQ搜索与算法扩展相结合的方法为未来探索提供了稳健的途径。

Abstract: Machin-like arctangent relations are classical tools for computing $\pi$,
with efficiency quantified by the Lehmer measure ($\lambda$). We present a
framework for discovering low-measure relations by coupling the PSLQ
integer-relation algorithm with number-theoretic filters derived from the
algebraic structure of Gaussian integers, making large scale search tractable.
Our search yields new 5 and 6 term relations with record-low Lehmer measures
($\lambda=1.4572, \lambda=1.3291$). We also demonstrate how discovered
relations can serve as a basis for generating new, longer formulae through
algorithmic extensions. This combined approach of a constrained PSLQ search and
algorithmic extension provides a robust method for future explorations.

Abstract: Surrogate modeling for systems with high-dimensional quantities of interest
remains challenging, particularly when training data are costly to acquire.
This work develops multifidelity methods for multiple-input multiple-output
linear regression targeting data-limited applications with high-dimensional
outputs. Multifidelity methods integrate many inexpensive low-fidelity model
evaluations with limited, costly high-fidelity evaluations. We introduce two
projection-based multifidelity linear regression approaches that leverage
principal component basis vectors for dimensionality reduction and combine
multifidelity data through: (i) a direct data augmentation using low-fidelity
data, and (ii) a data augmentation incorporating explicit linear corrections
between low-fidelity and high-fidelity data. The data augmentation approaches
combine high-fidelity and low-fidelity data into a unified training set and
train the linear regression model through weighted least squares with
fidelity-specific weights. Various weighting schemes and their impact on
regression accuracy are explored. The proposed multifidelity linear regression
methods are demonstrated on approximating the surface pressure field of a
hypersonic vehicle in flight. In a low-data regime of no more than ten
high-fidelity samples, multifidelity linear regression achieves approximately
3% - 12% improvement in median accuracy compared to single-fidelity methods

Conclusion: ICL在多类分类中表现优异，且不仅限于transformer架构，MLP也能实现类似效果。

Abstract: This paper investigates the expected excess risk of In-Context Learning (ICL)
for multiclass classification. We model each task as a sequence of labeled
prompt samples and a query input, where a pre-trained model estimates the
conditional class probabilities of the query. The expected excess risk is
defined as the average truncated Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the
predicted and ground-truth conditional class distributions, averaged over a
specified family of tasks. We establish a new oracle inequality for the
expected excess risk based on KL divergence in multiclass classification. This
allows us to derive tight upper and lower bounds for the expected excess risk
in transformer-based models, demonstrating that the ICL estimator achieves the
minimax optimal rate - up to a logarithmic factor - for conditional probability
estimation. From a technical standpoint, our results introduce a novel method
for controlling generalization error using the uniform empirical covering
entropy of the log-likelihood function class. Furthermore, we show that
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) can also perform ICL and achieve this optimal
rate under specific assumptions, suggesting that transformers may not be the
exclusive architecture capable of effective ICL.

applications. Recently, model-agnostic methods have been proposed to measure
conditional variable importance and accommodate complex non-linear models.
However, they often lack power when dealing with highly correlated data, a
common problem in medical imaging. We introduce Hierarchical-CPI, a
model-agnostic variable importance measure that frames the inference problem as
the discovery of groups of variables that are jointly predictive of the
outcome. By exploring subgroups along a hierarchical tree, it remains
computationally tractable, yet also enjoys explicit family-wise error rate
control. Moreover, we address the issue of vanishing conditional importance
under high correlation with a tree-based importance allocation mechanism. We
benchmarked Hierarchical-CPI against state-of-the-art variable importance
methods. Its effectiveness is demonstrated in two neuroimaging datasets:
classifying dementia diagnoses from MRI data (ADNI dataset) and analyzing the
Berger effect on EEG data (TDBRAIN dataset), identifying biologically plausible
variables.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨BP在生物大脑中的不适用性，并引入PC作为一种更接近生物学习机制的替代方法。

Conclusion: PC为神经网络训练提供了一种生物可行的替代方案，具有潜在的理论和实践价值。

Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) of errors is the backbone training algorithm for
artificial neural networks (ANNs). It updates network weights through gradient
descent to minimize a loss function representing the mismatch between
predictions and desired outputs. BP uses the chain rule to propagate the loss
gradient backward through the network hierarchy, allowing efficient weight
updates. However, this process requires weight updates at every layer to rely
on a global error signal generated at the network's output.
  In contrast, the Hebbian model of synaptic plasticity states that weight
updates are local, depending only on the activity of pre- and post-synaptic
neurons. This suggests biological brains likely do not implement BP directly.
Recently, Predictive Coding (PC) has gained interest as a biologically
plausible alternative that updates weights using only local information.
Originating from 1950s work on signal compression, PC was later proposed as a
model of the visual cortex and formalized under the free energy principle,
linking it to Bayesian inference and dynamical systems. PC weight updates rely
solely on local information and provide theoretical advantages such as
automatic scaling of gradients based on uncertainty.
  This lecture notes column offers a novel, tutorial-style introduction to PC,
focusing on its formulation, derivation, and connections to well-known
optimization and signal processing algorithms such as BP and the Kalman Filter
(KF). It aims to support existing literature by guiding readers from the
mathematical foundations of PC to practical implementation, including Python
examples using PyTorch.

Abstract: Serving LLM adapters has gained significant attention as an effective
approach to adapt general-purpose language models to diverse, task-specific use
cases. However, serving a wide range of adapters introduces several and
substantial overheads, leading to performance degradation and challenges in
optimal placement. To address these challenges, we present an analytical,
AI-driven pipeline that accurately determines the optimal allocation of
adapters in single-node setups. This allocation maximizes performance,
effectively using GPU resources, while preventing request starvation.
Crucially, the proposed allocation is given based on current workload patterns.
These insights in single-node setups can be leveraged in multi-replica
deployments for overall placement, load balancing and server configuration,
ultimately enhancing overall performance and improving resource efficiency. Our
approach builds on an in-depth analysis of LLM adapter serving, accounting for
overheads and performance variability, and includes the development of the
first Digital Twin capable of replicating online LLM-adapter serving systems
with matching key performance metrics. The experimental results demonstrate
that the Digital Twin achieves a SMAPE difference of no more than 5.5% in
throughput compared to real results, and the proposed pipeline accurately
predicts the optimal placement with minimal latency.

Method: 比较了线性插值、KNN、PCHIP和B样条四种方法，使用预测准确性指标和统计距离（如CDT和JS距离）进行评估。

Result: 分析揭示了现有插补方法的局限性，并缺乏评估生理信号插补质量的稳健框架。

Conclusion: 提出了一个综合评估指标的基础框架，以更全面地评估插补性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in wearable technology have enabled the continuous monitoring
of vital physiological signals, essential for predictive modeling and early
detection of extreme physiological events. Among these physiological signals,
heart rate (HR) plays a central role, as it is widely used in monitoring and
managing cardiovascular conditions and detecting extreme physiological events
such as hypoglycemia. However, data from wearable devices often suffer from
missing values. To address this issue, recent studies have employed various
imputation techniques. Traditionally, the effectiveness of these methods has
been evaluated using predictive accuracy metrics such as RMSE, MAPE, and MAE,
which assess numerical proximity to the original data. While informative, these
metrics fail to capture the complex statistical structure inherent in
physiological signals. This study bridges this gap by presenting a
comprehensive evaluation of four statistical imputation methods, linear
interpolation, K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating
Polynomial (PCHIP), and B splines, for short term HR data gaps. We assess their
performance using both predictive accuracy metrics and statistical distance
measures, including the Cohen Distance Test (CDT) and Jensen Shannon Distance
(JS Distance), applied to HR data from the D1NAMO dataset and the BIG IDEAs Lab
Glycemic Variability and Wearable Device dataset. The analysis reveals
limitations in existing imputation approaches and the absence of a robust
framework for evaluating imputation quality in physiological signals. Finally,
this study proposes a foundational framework to develop a composite evaluation
metric to assess imputation performance.

Result: 算法在消费者搜索成本高时协调降低价格和广告竞价，平台通过调整佣金可增加利润。

Conclusion: 研究缓解了对AI算法潜在负面影响的担忧，为卖家、平台和政策制定者提供了决策依据。

Abstract: Online sellers have been adopting AI learning algorithms to automatically
make product pricing and advertising decisions on e-commerce platforms. When
sellers compete using such algorithms, one concern is that of tacit collusion -
the algorithms learn to coordinate on higher than competitive. We empirically
investigate whether these concerns are valid when sellers make pricing and
advertising decisions together, i.e., two-dimensional decisions. Our empirical
strategy is to analyze competition with multi-agent reinforcement learning,
which we calibrate to a large-scale dataset collected from Amazon.com products.
Our first contribution is to find conditions under which learning algorithms
can facilitate win-win-win outcomes that are beneficial for consumers, sellers,
and even the platform, when consumers have high search costs. In these cases
the algorithms learn to coordinate on prices that are lower than competitive
prices. The intuition is that the algorithms learn to coordinate on lower
advertising bids, which lower advertising costs, leading to lower prices. Our
second contribution is an analysis of a large-scale, high-frequency
keyword-product dataset for more than 2 million products on Amazon.com. Our
estimates of consumer search costs show a wide range of costs for different
product keywords. We generate an algorithm usage and find a negative
interaction between the estimated consumer search costs and the algorithm usage
index, providing empirical evidence of beneficial collusion. Finally, we
analyze the platform's strategic response. We find that reserve price
adjustments will not increase profits for the platform, but commission
adjustments will. Our analyses help alleviate some worries about the
potentially harmful effects of competing learning algorithms, and can help
sellers, platforms and policymakers to decide on whether to adopt or regulate
such algorithms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating code generation
and software engineering tasks, yet they often struggle with complex,
multi-file projects due to context limitations and knowledge gaps. We propose a
novel context engineering workflow that combines multiple AI components: an
Intent Translator (GPT-5) for clarifying user requirements, an Elicit-powered
semantic literature retrieval for injecting domain knowledge, NotebookLM-based
document synthesis for contextual understanding, and a Claude Code multi-agent
system for code generation and validation. Our integrated approach leverages
intent clarification, retrieval-augmented generation, and specialized
sub-agents orchestrated via Claude's agent framework. We demonstrate that this
method significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of code assistants
in real-world repositories, yielding higher single-shot success rates and
better adherence to project context than baseline single-agent approaches.
Qualitative results on a large Next.js codebase show the multi-agent system
effectively plans, edits, and tests complex features with minimal human
intervention. We compare our system with recent frameworks like CodePlan,
MASAI, and HyperAgent, highlighting how targeted context injection and agent
role decomposition lead to state-of-the-art performance. Finally, we discuss
the implications for deploying LLM-based coding assistants in production, along
with lessons learned on context management and future research directions.

Method: 评估150道LeetCode题目，比较3种SLMs和2种LLMs的运行时、内存、能耗和正确性，以人工代码为基准。

Result: LLMs在所有难度题目中正确性最高，但SLMs在52%的题目中能耗更低或相同。

Conclusion: SLMs在能效上优于LLMs，适合特定编程问题，可作为LLMs的节能替代方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for code generation. However,
commercial models like ChatGPT require significant computing power, which leads
to high energy use and carbon emissions. This has raised concerns about their
environmental impact. In this study, we evaluate open-source Small Language
Models (SLMs) trained explicitly for code generation and compare their
performance and energy efficiency against large LLMs and efficient
human-written Python code. The goal is to investigate whether SLMs can match
the performance of LLMs on certain types of programming problems while
producing more energy-efficient code. We evaluate 150 coding problems from
LeetCode, evenly distributed across three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and
hard. Our comparison includes three small open-source models, StableCode-3B,
StarCoderBase-3B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Instruct, and two large commercial
models, GPT-4.0 and DeepSeek-Reasoner. The generated code is evaluated using
four key metrics: run-time, memory usage, energy consumption, and correctness.
We use human-written solutions as a baseline to assess the quality and
efficiency of the model-generated code. Results indicate that LLMs achieve the
highest correctness across all difficulty levels, but SLMs are often more
energy-efficient when their outputs are correct. In over 52% of the evaluated
problems, SLMs consumed the same or less energy than LLMs.

Motivation: 日志级别选择对系统可观测性和性能至关重要，现有基于ML的预测方法依赖随机上下文示例，忽略了代码结构和开发实践。

Method: 提出OmniLLP框架，基于语义相似性和开发者所有权聚类选择上下文示例，优化LLM的预测准确性。

Result: 语义和所有权聚类显著提升预测准确性（AUC提高8%），组合方法达到0.88-0.96 AUC。

Conclusion: 结合软件工程特定上下文（如代码语义和开发者所有权）可显著提升日志级别预测的准确性，增强系统可维护性和可观测性。

Abstract: Developers insert logging statements in source code to capture relevant
runtime information essential for maintenance and debugging activities. Log
level choice is an integral, yet tricky part of the logging activity as it
controls log verbosity and therefore influences systems' observability and
performance. Recent advances in ML-based log level prediction have leveraged
large language models (LLMs) to propose log level predictors (LLPs) that
demonstrated promising performance improvements (AUC between 0.64 and 0.8).
Nevertheless, current LLM-based LLPs rely on randomly selected in-context
examples, overlooking the structure and the diverse logging practices within
modern software projects. In this paper, we propose OmniLLP, a novel LLP
enhancement framework that clusters source files based on (1) semantic
similarity reflecting the code's functional purpose, and (2) developer
ownership cohesion. By retrieving in-context learning examples exclusively from
these semantic and ownership aware clusters, we aim to provide more coherent
prompts to LLPs leveraging LLMs, thereby improving their predictive accuracy.
Our results show that both semantic and ownership-aware clusterings
statistically significantly improve the accuracy (by up to 8\% AUC) of the
evaluated LLM-based LLPs compared to random predictors (i.e., leveraging
randomly selected in-context examples from the whole project). Additionally,
our approach that combines the semantic and ownership signal for in-context
prediction achieves an impressive 0.88 to 0.96 AUC across our evaluated
projects. Our findings highlight the value of integrating software
engineering-specific context, such as code semantic and developer ownership
signals into LLM-LLPs, offering developers a more accurate, contextually-aware
approach to logging and therefore, enhancing system maintainability and
observability.

Abstract: Language models have shown strong capabilities across a wide range of tasks
in software engineering, such as code generation, yet they suffer from
hallucinations. While hallucinations have been studied independently in natural
language and code generation, their occurrence in tasks involving code changes
which have a structurally complex and context-dependent format of code remains
largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of
hallucinations in two critical tasks involving code change to natural language
generation: commit message generation and code review comment generation. We
quantify the prevalence of hallucinations in recent language models and explore
a range of metric-based approaches to automatically detect them. Our findings
reveal that approximately 50\% of generated code reviews and 20\% of generated
commit messages contain hallucinations. Whilst commonly used metrics are weak
detectors on their own, combining multiple metrics substantially improves
performance. Notably, model confidence and feature attribution metrics
effectively contribute to hallucination detection, showing promise for
inference-time detection.\footnote{All code and data will be released upon
acceptance.

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效估计因果效应范围，并识别使因果效应无效的混杂强度。

Conclusion: ρ-GNF为因果推断中的敏感性分析提供了灵活且强大的工具，尤其适用于未观测混杂的场景。

Abstract: We propose a novel method for sensitivity analysis to unobserved confounding
in causal inference. The method builds on a copula-based causal graphical
normalizing flow that we term $\rho$-GNF, where $\rho \in [-1,+1]$ is the
sensitivity parameter. The parameter represents the non-causal association
between exposure and outcome due to unobserved confounding, which is modeled as
a Gaussian copula. In other words, the $\rho$-GNF enables scholars to estimate
the average causal effect (ACE) as a function of $\rho$, accounting for various
confounding strengths. The output of the $\rho$-GNF is what we term the
$\rho_{curve}$, which provides the bounds for the ACE given an interval of
assumed $\rho$ values. The $\rho_{curve}$ also enables scholars to identify the
confounding strength required to nullify the ACE. We also propose a Bayesian
version of our sensitivity analysis method. Assuming a prior over the
sensitivity parameter $\rho$ enables us to derive the posterior distribution
over the ACE, which enables us to derive credible intervals. Finally,
leveraging on experiments from simulated and real-world data, we show the
benefits of our sensitivity analysis method.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) challenge conventional methods of teaching
and learning, they present an exciting opportunity to improve efficiency and
scale high-quality instruction. One promising application is the generation of
customized exams, tailored to specific course content. There has been
significant recent excitement on automatically generating questions using
artificial intelligence, but also comparatively little work evaluating the
psychometric quality of these items in real-world educational settings. Filling
this gap is an important step toward understanding generative AI's role in
effective test design. In this study, we introduce and evaluate an iterative
refinement strategy for question generation, repeatedly producing, assessing,
and improving questions through cycles of LLM-generated critique and revision.
We evaluate the quality of these AI-generated questions in a large-scale field
study involving 91 classes -- covering computer science, mathematics,
chemistry, and more -- in dozens of colleges across the United States,
comprising nearly 1700 students. Our analysis, based on item response theory
(IRT), suggests that for students in our sample the AI-generated questions
performed comparably to expert-created questions designed for standardized
exams. Our results illustrate the power of AI to make high-quality assessments
more readily available, benefiting both teachers and students.

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in all fields
and daily activities, a heated debate is found about the advantages and
challenges of AI and the need for navigating the concerns associated with AI to
make the best of it. To contribute to this literature and the ongoing debate
related to it, this study draws on the Monster theory to explain the
conflicting representation of AI. It suggests that studying monsters in popular
culture can provide an in-depth understanding of AI and its monstrous effects.
Specifically, this study aims to discuss AI perception and development through
the seven theses of Monster theory. The obtained results revealed that, just
like monsters, AI is complex in nature, and it should not be studied as a
separate entity but rather within a given society or culture. Similarly,
readers may perceive and interpret AI differently, just as readers may
interpret monsters differently. The relationship between AI and monsters, as
depicted in this study, does not seem to be as odd as it might be at first.

Conclusion: 结论是该框架为道德决策提供了理论基础，支持多元道德复杂性的处理。

Abstract: The conceptual framework proposed in this paper centers on the development of
a deliberative moral reasoning system - one designed to process complex moral
situations by generating, filtering, and weighing normative arguments drawn
from diverse ethical perspectives. While the framework is rooted in Machine
Ethics, it also makes a substantive contribution to Value Alignment by
outlining a system architecture that links structured moral reasoning to action
under time constraints. Grounded in normative moral pluralism, this system is
not constructed to imitate behavior but is built on reason-sensitive
deliberation over structured moral content in a transparent and principled
manner. Beyond its role as a deliberative system, it also serves as the
conceptual foundation for a novel two-level architecture: functioning as a
moral reasoning teacher envisioned to train faster models that support
real-time responsiveness without reproducing the full structure of deliberative
reasoning. Together, the deliberative and intuitive components are designed to
enable both deep reflection and responsive action. A key design feature is the
dual-hybrid structure: a universal layer that defines a moral threshold through
top-down and bottom-up learning, and a local layer that learns to weigh
competing considerations in context while integrating culturally specific
normative content, so long as it remains within the universal threshold. By
extending the notion of moral complexity to include not only conflicting
beliefs but also multifactorial dilemmas, multiple stakeholders, and the
integration of non-moral considerations, the framework aims to support morally
grounded decision-making in realistic, high-stakes contexts.

Abstract: Social determinants are variables that, while not directly pertaining to any
specific individual, capture key aspects of contexts and environments that have
direct causal influences on certain attributes of an individual. Previous
algorithmic fairness literature has primarily focused on sensitive attributes,
often overlooking the role of social determinants. Our paper addresses this gap
by introducing formal and quantitative rigor into a space that has been shaped
largely by qualitative proposals regarding the use of social determinants. To
demonstrate theoretical perspectives and practical applicability, we examine a
concrete setting of college admissions, using region as a proxy for social
determinants. Our approach leverages a region-based analysis with Gamma
distribution parameterization to model how social determinants impact
individual outcomes. Despite its simplicity, our method quantitatively recovers
findings that resonate with nuanced insights in previous qualitative debates,
that are often missed by existing algorithmic fairness approaches. Our findings
suggest that mitigation strategies centering solely around sensitive attributes

Considering both sensitive attributes and social determinants facilitates a

TL;DR: 论文分析了主要AI公司对自愿承诺的履行情况，发现表现参差不齐，尤其在模型权重安全方面普遍较差，并提出改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI公司如何履行其自愿承诺，以评估当前国际AI治理的有效性。

Method: 通过制定详细评分标准，对16家公司在2023年对白宫八项自愿承诺的公开行为进行评分。

Result: 公司表现差异显著，OpenAI得分最高（83%），平均分仅52%，模型权重安全承诺平均分仅17%。

Conclusion: 未来AI治理需改进公司公开承诺的透明度和可验证性，并提出三点政策建议。

Abstract: Voluntary commitments are central to international AI governance, as
demonstrated by recent voluntary guidelines from the White House to the G7,
from Bletchley Park to Seoul. How do major AI companies make good on their
commitments? We score companies based on their publicly disclosed behavior by
developing a detailed rubric based on their eight voluntary commitments to the
White House in 2023. We find significant heterogeneity: while the
highest-scoring company (OpenAI) scores a 83% overall on our rubric, the
average score across all companies is just 52%. The companies demonstrate
systemically poor performance for their commitment to model weight security
with an average score of 17%: 11 of the 16 companies receive 0% for this
commitment. Our analysis highlights a clear structural shortcoming that future
AI governance initiatives should correct: when companies make public
commitments, they should proactively disclose how they meet their commitments
to provide accountability, and these disclosures should be verifiable. To
advance policymaking on corporate AI governance, we provide three directed
recommendations that address underspecified commitments, the role of complex AI
supply chains, and public transparency that could be applied towards AI
governance initiatives worldwide.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了合成数据在GDPR下是否应归类为个人数据，通过法律分析和实证研究，发现合成数据可能是匿名的，但需明确法规以平衡隐私与AI发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在医疗领域的潜力需要健康数据支持，合成数据可保护隐私，但GDPR的不确定性限制了其应用。

Method: 系统分析法律文献并进行实证研究，模拟推理攻击评估识别风险。

Result: 合成数据可能是匿名的，但需考虑特定因素；现有对技术识别风险的认知可能不足。

Conclusion: 呼吁明确法规以促进创新，平衡隐私保护与AI在医疗中的发展。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform healthcare, but
it requires access to health data. Synthetic data that is generated through
machine learning models trained on real data, offers a way to share data while
preserving privacy. However, uncertainties in the practical application of the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) create an administrative burden,
limiting the benefits of synthetic data. Through a systematic analysis of
relevant legal sources and an empirical study, this article explores whether
synthetic data should be classified as personal data under the GDPR. The study
investigates the residual identification risk through generating synthetic data
and simulating inference attacks, challenging common perceptions of technical
identification risk. The findings suggest synthetic data is likely anonymous,
depending on certain factors, but highlights uncertainties about what
constitutes reasonably likely risk. To promote innovation, the study calls for
clearer regulations to balance privacy protection with the advancement of AI in
healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限的环境中，LLM开发者与领域专家之间的沟通受限，如何有效合作设计LLM应用是一个关键问题。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的合作设计框架，将摘要生成任务分解为可单独优化的属性，并通过多级级联方法高效验证。

Result: 研究发现，关键挑战在于精确指定信息，以确保LLM应用的准确性、全面性和可验证性。

Conclusion: 该框架为资源有限环境中的LLM应用设计提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to address social and
behavioral determinants of health by transforming labor intensive workflows in
resource-constrained settings. Creating LLM-based applications that serve the
needs of underserved communities requires a deep understanding of their local
context, but it is often the case that neither LLMs nor their developers
possess this local expertise, and the experts in these communities often face
severe time/resource constraints. This creates a disconnect: how can one engage
in meaningful co-design of an LLM-based application for an under-resourced
community when the communication channel between the LLM developer and domain
expert is constrained? We explored this question through a real-world case
study, in which our data science team sought to partner with social workers at
a safety net hospital to build an LLM application that summarizes patients'
social needs. Whereas prior works focus on the challenge of prompt tuning, we
found that the most critical challenge in this setting is the careful and
precise specification of \what information to surface to providers so that the
LLM application is accurate, comprehensive, and verifiable. Here we present a
novel co-design framework for settings with limited access to domain experts,
in which the summary generation task is first decomposed into
individually-optimizable attributes and then each attribute is efficiently
refined and validated through a multi-tier cascading approach.

Method: 结合技术和法律视角，分析AI代理与法律代理概念的异同，揭示计算机科学在忠诚度和第三方互动方面的理论缺陷。

Result: 发现AI代理在价值对齐和披露忠诚度方面存在法律概念上的不足，可能导致电子商务代理的意外效果。

Conclusion: 提出了负责任AI代理开发和部署的改进路径。

Abstract: As AI becomes more "agentic," it faces technical and socio-legal issues it
must address if it is to fulfill its promise of increased economic productivity
and efficiency. This paper uses technical and legal perspectives to explain how
things change when AI systems start being able to directly execute tasks on
behalf of a user. We show how technical conceptions of agents track some, but
not all, socio-legal conceptions of agency. That is, both computer science and
the law recognize the problems of under-specification for an agent, and both
disciplines have robust conceptions of how to address ensuring an agent does
what the programmer, or in the law, the principal desires and no more. However,
to date, computer science has under-theorized issues related to questions of
loyalty and to third parties that interact with an agent, both of which are
central parts of the law of agency. First, we examine the correlations between
implied authority in agency law and the principle of value-alignment in AI,
wherein AI systems must operate under imperfect objective specification.
Second, we reveal gaps in the current computer science view of agents
pertaining to the legal concepts of disclosure and loyalty, and how failure to
account for them can result in unintended effects in AI ecommerce agents. In
surfacing these gaps, we show a path forward for responsible AI agent
development and deployment.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI在稀缺资源分配中的效果，提出了RENT指标，发现个体化目标政策在高风险家庭集中的地区更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究个体化目标政策与基于社区的政策在资源分配中的效果差异，并调和现有文献中的矛盾结果。

Method: 基于Mallows模型开发框架，引入RENT指标，校准模型参数以分析美国某中等城市的驱逐记录。

Result: 个体化目标政策在高风险家庭集中的地区显著提升了资源分配效率。

Conclusion: 文献中的矛盾可通过考虑部署成本和风险集中度来解释，为AI在公共服务中的应用提供指导。

Abstract: AI-powered scarce resource allocation policies rely on predictions to target
either specific individuals (e.g., high-risk) or settings (e.g.,
neighborhoods). Recent research on individual-level targeting demonstrates
conflicting results; some models show that targeting is not useful when
inequality is high, while other work demonstrates potential benefits. To study
and reconcile this apparent discrepancy, we develop a stylized framework based
on the Mallows model to understand how the spatial distribution of inequality
affects the effectiveness of door-to-door outreach policies. We introduce the
RENT (Relative Efficiency of Non-Targeting) metric, which we use to assess the
effectiveness of targeting approaches compared with neighborhood-based
approaches in preventing tenant eviction when high-risk households are more
versus less spatially concentrated. We then calibrate the model parameters to
eviction court records collected in a medium-sized city in the USA. Results
demonstrate considerable gains in the number of high-risk households canvassed
through individually targeted policies, even in a highly segregated metro area
with concentrated risks of eviction. We conclude that apparent discrepancies in
the prior literature can be reconciled by considering 1) the source of
deployment costs and 2) the observed versus modeled concentrations of risk. Our
results inform the deployment of AI-based solutions in social service provision
that account for particular applications and geographies.

Result: 研究发现令牌走私、对抗性提示、直接注入和多步越狱是对eLLMs最严重的攻击。

Conclusion: 该分类法和风险评估有助于教育机构和工业界构建更具韧性的解决方案，保护学习者和机构。

Abstract: Due to perceptions of efficiency and significant productivity gains, various
organisations, including in education, are adopting Large Language Models
(LLMs) into their workflows. Educator-facing, learner-facing, and
institution-facing LLMs, collectively, Educational Large Language Models
(eLLMs), complement and enhance the effectiveness of teaching, learning, and
academic operations. However, their integration into an educational setting
raises significant cybersecurity concerns. A comprehensive landscape of
contemporary attacks on LLMs and their impact on the educational environment is
missing. This study presents a generalised taxonomy of fifty attacks on LLMs,
which are categorized as attacks targeting either models or their
infrastructure. The severity of these attacks is evaluated in the educational
sector using the DREAD risk assessment framework. Our risk assessment indicates
that token smuggling, adversarial prompts, direct injection, and multi-step
jailbreak are critical attacks on eLLMs. The proposed taxonomy, its application
in the educational environment, and our risk assessment will help academic and
industrial practitioners to build resilient solutions that protect learners and
institutions.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于城市理论的时空注意力模型（Urban-STA4CLC），用于预测自然灾害后商业用地变化，模型性能显著优于非理论基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然灾害（如飓风和野火）对经济活动的影响日益显著，尤其是商业用地模式的变化。现有模型难以捕捉人类活动与商业用地变化之间的复杂关系，而城市韧性规划理论对此提供了更有效的视角。

Method: 研究设计并校准了Urban-STA4CLC模型，结合时空注意力机制和三个理论模块（韧性理论、空间经济理论和扩散理论），预测两年内商业用地的衰退与扩张。

Result: 模型在预测飓风频发情景下的商业用地变化时，F1分数显著提高19%（0.8763），理论模块的有效性通过消融实验进一步验证。

Conclusion: 将城市理论嵌入商业用地模型可显著提升其预测能力，为考虑灾害累积影响和经济活动变化的土地利用研究提供了新方法。

Abstract: Natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires increasingly introduce
unusual disturbance on economic activities, which are especially likely to
reshape commercial land use pattern given their sensitive to customer
visitation. However, current modeling approaches are limited in capturing such
complex interplay between human activities and commercial land use change under
and following disturbances. Such interactions have been more effectively
captured in current resilient urban planning theories. This study designs and
calibrates a Urban Theory-Informed Spatio-Temporal Attention Model for
Predicting Post-Disaster Commercial Land Use Change (Urban-STA4CLC) to predict
both the yearly decline and expansion of commercial land use at census block
level under cumulative impact of disasters on human activities over two years.
Guided by urban theories, Urban-STA4CLC integrates both spatial and temporal
attention mechanisms with three theory-informed modules. Resilience theory
guides a disaster-aware temporal attention module that captures visitation
dynamics. Spatial economic theory informs a multi-relational spatial attention
module for inter-block representation. Diffusion theory contributes a
regularization term that constrains land use transitions. The model performs
significantly better than non-theoretical baselines in predicting commercial
land use change under the scenario of recurrent hurricanes, with around 19%
improvement in F1 score (0.8763). The effectiveness of the theory-guided
modules was further validated through ablation studies. The research
demonstrates that embedding urban theory into commercial land use modeling
models may substantially enhance the capacity to capture its gains and losses.
These advances in commercial land use modeling contribute to land use research
that accounts for cumulative impacts of recurrent disasters and shifts in
economic activity patterns.

Abstract: The rapid emergence of large language models (LLMs) has raised urgent
questions across the modern workforce about this new technology's strengths,
weaknesses, and capabilities. For privacy professionals, the question is
whether these AI systems can provide reliable support on regulatory compliance,
privacy program management, and AI governance. In this study, we evaluate ten
leading open and closed LLMs, including models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google
DeepMind, Meta, and DeepSeek, by benchmarking their performance on
industry-standard certification exams: CIPP/US, CIPM, CIPT, and AIGP from the
International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP). Each model was
tested using official sample exams in a closed-book setting and compared to
IAPP's passing thresholds. Our findings show that several frontier models such
as Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI's GPT-5 consistently achieve scores exceeding the
standards for professional human certification - demonstrating substantial
expertise in privacy law, technical controls, and AI governance. The results
highlight both the strengths and domain-specific gaps of current LLMs and offer
practical insights for privacy officers, compliance leads, and technologists
assessing the readiness of AI tools for high-stakes data governance roles. This
paper provides an overview for professionals navigating the intersection of AI
advancement and regulatory risk and establishes a machine benchmark based on
human-centric evaluations.

Result: 当前基于启发式的设计存在局限性，本文提出了一种资源受限、支持6G的医疗系统研究议程。

Conclusion: 该框架旨在实现下一代移动健康应用的超可靠、安全和自优化的WBAN。

Abstract: Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) enable continuous monitoring of
physiological signals for applications ranging from chronic disease management
to emergency response. Recent advances in 6G communications, post-quantum
cryptography, and energy harvesting have the potential to enhance WBAN
performance. However, integrating these technologies into a unified, adaptive
system remains a challenge. This paper surveys some of the most well-known
Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) architectures, routing strategies, and
security mechanisms, identifying key gaps in adaptability, energy efficiency,
and quantum-resistant security. We propose a novel Large Language Model-driven
adaptive WBAN framework in which a Large Language Model acts as a cognitive
control plane, coordinating routing, physical layer selection, micro-energy
harvesting, and post-quantum security in real time. Our review highlights the
limitations of current heuristic-based designs and outlines a research agenda
for resource-constrained, 6G-ready medical systems. This approach aims to
enable ultra-reliable, secure, and self-optimizing WBANs for next-generation
mobile health applications.

Motivation: 6G中MAR应用需要高精度设备姿态估计，但传统方法存在通信开销大和QoE保障不足的问题。

Method: 1. 利用LLM建立数字代理，连接MAR服务与网络域；2. 开发用户级QoE建模方法，实现个性化资源管理。

Result: 仿真表明，该方法在QoE建模精度和通信资源效率上优于传统LLM方法。

Conclusion: 代理驱动的通信服务方法有效提升了MAR的QoE和资源效率。

Abstract: Mobile augmented reality (MAR) is envisioned as a key immersive application
in 6G, enabling virtual content rendering aligned with the physical environment
through device pose estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel agent-driven
communication service provisioning approach for edge-assisted MAR, aiming to
reduce communication overhead between MAR devices and the edge server while
ensuring the quality of experience (QoE). First, to address the inaccessibility
of MAR application-specific information to the network controller, we establish
a digital agent powered by large language models (LLMs) on behalf of the MAR
service provider, bridging the data and function gap between the MAR service
and network domains. Second, to cope with the user-dependent and dynamic nature
of data traffic patterns for individual devices, we develop a user-level QoE
modeling method that captures the relationship between communication resource
demands and perceived user QoE, enabling personalized, agent-driven
communication resource management. Trace-driven simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed approach outperforms conventional LLM-based QoE-aware service
provisioning methods in both user-level QoE modeling accuracy and communication
resource efficiency.

Motivation: 户外健康监测对保障人类健康和安全至关重要，但现有方法依赖静态多模态深度学习框架，需要大量数据训练且难以捕捉细微健康变化。多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）虽具潜力，但仍面临噪声干扰、多模态融合不鲁棒和数据恢复困难等挑战。

Method: 提出DUAL-Health框架：1) 量化输入和波动噪声引起的模态不确定性；2) 基于校准的不确定性为每个模态定制融合权重；3) 在共同语义空间中对齐模态分布以增强数据恢复。

Result: 实验表明，DUAL-Health在检测准确性和鲁棒性上优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: DUAL-Health通过不确定性感知的多模态融合，有效解决了户外健康监测中的噪声和动态环境挑战，为实际应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Outdoor health monitoring is essential to detect early abnormal health status
for safeguarding human health and safety. Conventional outdoor monitoring
relies on static multimodal deep learning frameworks, which requires extensive
data training from scratch and fails to capture subtle health status changes.
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) emerge as a promising alternative,
utilizing only small datasets to fine-tune pre-trained information-rich models
for enabling powerful health status monitoring. Unfortunately, MLLM-based
outdoor health monitoring also faces significant challenges: I) sensor data
contains input noise stemming from sensor data acquisition and fluctuation
noise caused by sudden changes in physiological signals due to dynamic outdoor
environments, thus degrading the training performance; ii) current transformer
based MLLMs struggle to achieve robust multimodal fusion, as they lack a design
for fusing the noisy modality; iii) modalities with varying noise levels hinder
accurate recovery of missing data from fluctuating distributions. To combat
these challenges, we propose an uncertainty-aware multimodal fusion framework,
named DUAL-Health, for outdoor health monitoring in dynamic and noisy
environments. First, to assess the impact of noise, we accurately quantify
modality uncertainty caused by input and fluctuation noise with current and
temporal features. Second, to empower efficient muitimodal fusion with
low-quality modalities,we customize the fusion weight for each modality based
on quantified and calibrated uncertainty. Third, to enhance data recovery from
fluctuating noisy modalities, we align modality distributions within a common
semantic space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DUAL-Health
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Wireless communication systems can significantly benefit from the
availability of spatially consistent representations of the wireless channel to
efficiently perform a wide range of communication tasks. Towards this purpose,
channel charting has been introduced as an effective unsupervised learning
technique to achieve both locally and globally consistent radio maps. In this
letter, we propose Chartwin, a case study on the integration of
localization-oriented channel charting with dynamic Digital Network Twins
(DNTs). Numerical results showcase the significant performance of
semi-supervised channel charting in constructing a spatially consistent chart
of the considered extended urban environment. The considered method results in
$\approx$ 4.5 m localization error for the static DNT and $\approx$ 6 m in the
dynamic DNT, fostering DNT-aided channel charting and localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统线性MMSE方法在无线通信系统中存在局限性，如依赖其他参考信号且无法处理未知预编码的信道。ReQuestNet旨在通过统一模型简化信道估计流程，并提升性能。

Method: ReQuestNet由CoarseNet和RefinementNet两个子单元组成，分别进行粗略信道估计和精细化处理，利用跨预编码PRG和跨MIMO空间维度的相关性。

Result: 仿真结果表明，ReQuestNet在多种信道条件和延迟-多普勒剖面下显著优于传统MMSE方法，最高可实现10dB的性能增益。

Conclusion: ReQuestNet能够有效泛化到未见过的信道剖面，并在动态PRG捆绑大小和变化的传输层分配下高效利用相关性。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel neural architecture for channel estimation
(CE) in 5G and beyond, the Recurrent Equivariant UERS Estimation Network
(ReQuestNet). It incorporates several practical considerations in wireless
communication systems, such as ability to handle variable number of resource
block (RB), dynamic number of transmit layers, physical resource block groups
(PRGs) bundling size (BS), demodulation reference signal (DMRS) patterns with a
single unified model, thereby, drastically simplifying the CE pipeline. Besides
it addresses several limitations of the legacy linear MMSE solutions, for
example, by being independent of other reference signals and particularly by
jointly processing MIMO layers and differently precoded channels with unknown
precoding at the receiver. ReQuestNet comprises of two sub-units, CoarseNet
followed by RefinementNet. CoarseNet performs per PRG, per transmit-receive
(Tx-Rx) stream channel estimation, while RefinementNet refines the CoarseNet
channel estimate by incorporating correlations across differently precoded
PRGs, and correlation across multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channel
spatial dimensions (cross-MIMO). Simulation results demonstrate that ReQuestNet
significantly outperforms genie minimum mean squared error (MMSE) CE across a
wide range of channel conditions, delay-Doppler profiles, achieving up to 10dB
gain at high SNRs. Notably, ReQuestNet generalizes effectively to unseen
channel profiles, efficiently exploiting inter-PRG and cross-MIMO correlations
under dynamic PRG BS and varying transmit layer allocations.

Abstract: Digital Humanities (DH) is an interdisciplinary field that integrates
computational methods with humanities scholarship to investigate innovative
topics. Each academic discipline follows a unique developmental path shaped by
the topics researchers investigate and the methods they employ. With the help
of bibliometric analysis, most of previous studies have examined DH across
multiple dimensions such as research hotspots, co-author networks, and
institutional rankings. However, these studies have often been limited in their
ability to provide deep insights into the current state of technological
advancements and topic development in DH. As a result, their conclusions tend
to remain superficial or lack interpretability in understanding how methods and
topics interrelate in the field. To address this gap, this study introduced a
new concept of Topic-Method Composition (TMC), which refers to a hybrid
knowledge structure generated by the co-occurrence of specific research topics
and the corresponding method. Especially by analyzing the interaction between
TMCs, we can see more clearly the intersection and integration of digital
technology and humanistic subjects in DH. Moreover, this study developed a
TMC-based workflow combining bibliometric analysis, topic modeling, and network
analysis to analyze the development characteristics and patterns of research
disciplines. By applying this workflow to large-scale bibliometric data, it
enables a detailed view of the knowledge structures, providing a tool adaptable

TL;DR: SRP是一种统一的预测建模框架，通过结合单依赖和复合依赖关系，提升关系数据库的预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关系数据库（RDBs）虽广泛应用，但其结构限制了深度学习方法的潜力。现有研究多关注单依赖关系，忽略了复合依赖关系的潜在价值。

Method: SRP框架通过特征合成、信息检索和图传播，捕捉单依赖和复合依赖关系，扩展表格数据的感知范围。

Result: 在五个真实数据集上的实验验证了SRP的有效性，并展示了其在工业场景中的潜力。

Conclusion: SRP通过全面捕捉依赖关系，显著提升了关系数据库的预测能力，为未来应用提供了实用指南。

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) have become the industry standard for storing
massive and heterogeneous data. However, despite the widespread use of RDBs
across various fields, the inherent structure of relational databases hinders
their ability to benefit from flourishing deep learning methods. Previous
research has primarily focused on exploiting the unary dependency among
multiple tables in a relational database using the primary key - foreign key
relationships, either joining multiple tables into a single table or
constructing a graph among them, which leaves the implicit composite relations
among different tables and a substantial potential of improvement for
predictive modeling unexplored. In this paper, we propose SRP, a unified
predictive modeling framework that synthesizes features using the unary
dependency, retrieves related information to capture the composite dependency,
and propagates messages across a constructed graph to learn adjacent patterns
for prediction on relation databases. By introducing a new retrieval mechanism
into RDB, SRP is designed to fully capture both the unary and the composite
dependencies within a relational database, thereby enhancing the receptive
field of tabular data prediction. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis on the components of SRP, offering a nuanced understanding of model
behaviors and practical guidelines for future applications. Extensive
experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SRP
and its potential applicability in industrial scenarios. The code is released
at https://github.com/NingLi670/SRP.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的SQL查询重写框架E3-Rewrite，通过上下文构造模块和强化学习框架，生成可执行、等效且高效的查询重写。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于规则的SQL重写方法泛化能力差，难以处理复杂查询，且无法完全捕捉有效的重写策略。

Method: E3-Rewrite结合上下文构造模块（利用执行计划和演示构建提示）和强化学习框架（奖励函数针对可执行性、等效性和效率）。

Result: 实验表明，E3-Rewrite在多个SQL基准测试中，查询执行时间减少25.6%，成功重写率提高24.4%。

Conclusion: E3-Rewrite显著提升了SQL重写的性能和覆盖范围，尤其适用于复杂查询。

Abstract: SQL query rewriting aims to reformulate a query into a more efficient form
while preserving equivalence. Most existing methods rely on predefined rewrite
rules. However, such rule-based approaches face fundamental limitations: (1)
fixed rule sets generalize poorly to novel query patterns and struggle with
complex queries; (2) a wide range of effective rewriting strategies cannot be
fully captured by declarative rules. To overcome these issues, we propose using
large language models (LLMs) to generate rewrites. LLMs can capture complex
strategies, such as evaluation reordering and CTE rewriting. Despite this
potential, directly applying LLMs often results in suboptimal or non-equivalent
rewrites due to a lack of execution awareness and semantic grounding. To
address these challenges, We present E3-Rewrite, an LLM-based SQL rewriting
framework that produces executable, equivalent, and efficient queries. It
integrates two core components: a context construction module and a
reinforcement learning framework. First, the context module leverages execution
plans and retrieved demonstrations to build bottleneck-aware prompts that guide
inference-time rewriting. Second, we design a reward function targeting
executability, equivalence, and efficiency, evaluated via syntax checks,
equivalence verification, and cost estimation. Third, to ensure stable
multi-objective learning, we adopt a staged curriculum that first emphasizes
executability and equivalence, then gradually incorporates efficiency.
Extensive experiments show that E3-Rewrite achieves up to a 25.6\% reduction in
query execution time compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple SQL
benchmarks. Moreover, it delivers up to 24.4\% more successful rewrites,
expanding coverage to complex queries that previous systems failed to handle.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI和AR技术主要将儿童定位为消费者，而非创造者。Capybara旨在改变这一现状，赋予儿童创作能力。

Method: Capybara结合文本到3D生成AI、自动绑定、身体追踪和视觉AI模型，支持儿童创作虚拟角色及其与物理环境的互动。

Result: 用户研究表明，Capybara能有效帮助儿童创作个性化AR体验，连接虚拟与物理世界。

Conclusion: Capybara展示了AI和AR技术在儿童创造力培养中的潜力，成功实现了从消费者到创造者的转变。

Abstract: Despite their potential to enhance children's learning experiences,
AI-enabled AR technologies are predominantly used in ways that position
children as consumers rather than creators. We introduce Capybara, an AR-based
and AI-powered visual programming environment that empowers children to create,
customize, and program 3D characters overlaid onto the physical world. Capybara
enables children to create virtual characters and accessories using text-to-3D
generative AI models, and to animate these characters through auto-rigging and
body tracking. In addition, our system employs vision-based AI models to
recognize physical objects, allowing children to program interactive behaviors
between virtual characters and their physical surroundings. We demonstrate the
expressiveness of Capybara through a set of novel AR experiences. We conducted
user studies with 20 children in the United States and Argentina. Our findings
suggest that Capybara can empower children to harness AI in authoring
personalized and engaging AR experiences that seamlessly bridge the virtual and
physical worlds.

countries where GSV is deployed. We iteratively designed StreetViewAI with a
mixed-visual ability team and performed an evaluation with eleven blind users.
Our findings demonstrate the value of an accessible street view in supporting
POI investigations and remote route planning. We close by enumerating key
guidelines for future work.

Motivation: 研究生成式AI的广泛部署对环境的影响，以及科技公司如何通过设计策略强制用户使用AI。

Method: 通过分析科技公司的用户界面设计策略，识别两种主要设计方法：强制替换非AI功能及通过叙事推广AI。

Result: 发现强制使用AI的设计策略符合已知的欺骗性模式，可能导致环境负面影响。

Conclusion: 建议通过监管手段限制AI功能的强制采用，以减少环境危害。

Abstract: Generative AI is being massively deployed in digital services, at a scale
that will result in significant environmental harm. We document how tech
companies are transforming established user interfaces to impose AI use and
show how and to what extent these strategies fit within established deceptive
pattern categories. We identify two main design strategies that are implemented
to impose AI use in both personal and professional contexts: imposing AI
features in interfaces at the expense of existing non-AI features and promoting
narratives about AI that make it harder to resist using it. We discuss
opportunities for regulating the imposed adoption of AI features, which would
inevitably lead to negative environmental effects.

Motivation: 量子计算和机器学习的结合被认为是解决复杂问题的有力工具，尤其是在组合优化等领域。本文旨在通过改进FMA算法，提升其在黑盒优化问题中的性能。

Method: 开发了SFMA算法，通过子采样数据集训练因子分解机，而非使用完整数据集，从而提升解空间的探索性能。进一步通过使用不同大小的子采样数据集优化性能。

Result: SFMA在速度和准确性上优于FMA，并展示了在大规模问题中的潜在扩展性。

Conclusion: SFMA在特定类别的黑盒优化问题中表现出高效性和可扩展性，尤其是在大规模问题中能以较低计算成本运行。

Abstract: Quantum computing and machine learning are state-of-the-art technologies
which have been investigated intensively in both academia and industry. The
hybrid technology of these two ingredients is expected to be a powerful tool to
solve complex problems in many branches of science and engineering such as
combinatorial optimization problems and accelerate the creation of
next-generation technologies. In this work, we develop an algorithm to solve a
black-box optimization problem by improving Factorization Machine Annealing
(FMA) such that the training of a machine learning model called Factorization
Machine is performed not by a full dataset but by a subdataset which is sampled
from a full dataset: Subsampling Factorization Machine Annealing (SFMA).
According to such a probabilistic training process, the performance of FMA on
exploring a solution space gets enhanced. As a result, SFMA exhibits balanced
performance of exploration and exploitation which we call
exploitation-exploration functionality. We conduct numerical benchmarking tests
to compare the performance of SFMA with that of FMA. Consequently, SFMA
certainly exhibits the exploration-exploitation functionality and outperforms
FMA in speed and accuracy. In addition, the performance of SFMA can be further
improved by sequentially using two subsampling datasets with different sizes
such that the size of the latter dataset is substantially smaller than the
former. Such a substantial reduction not only enhances the exploration
performance of SFMA but also enables us to run it with correspondingly low
computational cost even for a large-scale problem. These results indicate the
effectiveness of SFMA in a certain class of black-box optimization problems of
significant size: the potential scalability of SFMA in solving large-scale
problems with correspondingly low computational cost.

Abstract: A quantum thermodynamic system is described by a Hamiltonian and a list of
conserved, non-commuting charges, and a fundamental goal is to determine the
minimum energy of the system subject to constraints on the charges. Recently,
[Liu et al., arXiv:2505.04514] proposed first- and second-order classical and
hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for solving a dual chemical potential
maximization problem, and they proved that these algorithms converge to global
optima by means of gradient-ascent approaches. In this paper, we benchmark
these algorithms on several problems of interest in thermodynamics, including
one- and two-dimensional quantum Heisenberg models with nearest and
next-to-nearest neighbor interactions and with the charges set to the total
$x$, $y$, and $z$ magnetizations. We also offer an alternative compelling
interpretation of these algorithms as methods for designing ground and thermal
states of controllable Hamiltonians, with potential applications in molecular
and material design. Furthermore, we introduce stabilizer thermodynamic systems
as thermodynamic systems based on stabilizer codes, with the Hamiltonian
constructed from a given code's stabilizer operators and the charges
constructed from the code's logical operators. We benchmark the aforementioned
algorithms on several examples of stabilizer thermodynamic systems, including
those constructed from the one-to-three-qubit repetition code, the perfect
one-to-five-qubit code, and the two-to-four-qubit error-detecting code.
Finally, we observe that the aforementioned hybrid quantum-classical
algorithms, when applied to stabilizer thermodynamic systems, can serve as
alternative methods for encoding qubits into stabilizer codes at a fixed
temperature, and we provide an effective method for warm-starting these
encoding algorithms whenever a single qubit is encoded into multiple physical
qubits.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于sEMG信号的大规模EMG-to-Tendon Control数据集，用于肌腱驱动机械手的控制学习，并提出了扩散回归模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肌腱驱动机械手的控制学习缺乏直接的运动捕捉数据映射，且现有视觉跟踪方法易受遮挡和不准确性影响。sEMG传感器提供了一种低成本、鲁棒的替代方案，但将sEMG信号映射到肌腱控制仍具挑战性。

Method: 扩展了emg2pose数据集，创建了包含193名受试者、370小时记录的EMG-to-Tendon Control数据集，并提供了三种基线回归模型及一种新型扩散回归模型。

Result: 数据集和模型框架为肌腱驱动机械手的精确控制提供了基础，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究为肌腱驱动机械手的可扩展和精确控制奠定了基础，推动了灵巧机械操作的发展。

Abstract: Tendon-driven robotic hands offer unparalleled dexterity for manipulation
tasks, but learning control policies for such systems presents unique
challenges. Unlike joint-actuated robotic hands, tendon-driven systems lack a
direct one-to-one mapping between motion capture (mocap) data and tendon
controls, making the learning process complex and expensive. Additionally,
visual tracking methods for real-world applications are prone to occlusions and
inaccuracies, further complicating joint tracking. Wrist-wearable surface
electromyography (sEMG) sensors present an inexpensive, robust alternative to
capture hand motion. However, mapping sEMG signals to tendon control remains a
significant challenge despite the availability of EMG-to-pose data sets and
regression-based models in the existing literature.
  We introduce the first large-scale EMG-to-Tendon Control dataset for robotic
hands, extending the emg2pose dataset, which includes recordings from 193
subjects, spanning 370 hours and 29 stages with diverse gestures. This dataset
incorporates tendon control signals derived using the MyoSuite MyoHand model,
addressing limitations such as invalid poses in prior methods. We provide three
baseline regression models to demonstrate emg2tendon utility and propose a
novel diffusion-based regression model for predicting tendon control from sEMG
recordings. This dataset and modeling framework marks a significant step
forward for tendon-driven dexterous robotic manipulation, laying the groundwork
for scalable and accurate tendon control in robotic hands.

Method: SDAX利用无监督技能发现自动获取多样化技能，并通过双层优化动态调节探索程度。

Result: SDAX使四足机器人掌握了爬行、攀爬、跳跃等敏捷行为，并在真实硬件上成功部署。

Conclusion: SDAX显著减少了人工工程需求，实现了机器人行为的自主学习和泛化。

Abstract: Exploration is crucial for enabling legged robots to learn agile locomotion
behaviors that can overcome diverse obstacles. However, such exploration is
inherently challenging, and we often rely on extensive reward engineering,
expert demonstrations, or curriculum learning - all of which limit
generalizability. In this work, we propose Skill Discovery as Exploration
(SDAX), a novel learning framework that significantly reduces human engineering
effort. SDAX leverages unsupervised skill discovery to autonomously acquire a
diverse repertoire of skills for overcoming obstacles. To dynamically regulate
the level of exploration during training, SDAX employs a bi-level optimization
process that autonomously adjusts the degree of exploration. We demonstrate
that SDAX enables quadrupedal robots to acquire highly agile behaviors
including crawling, climbing, leaping, and executing complex maneuvers such as
jumping off vertical walls. Finally, we deploy the learned policy on real
hardware, validating its successful transfer to the real world.

Abstract: Robotic pick-and-place tasks in convenience stores pose challenges due to
dense object arrangements, occlusions, and variations in object properties such
as color, shape, size, and texture. These factors complicate trajectory
planning and grasping. This paper introduces a perception-action pipeline
leveraging annotation-guided visual prompting, where bounding box annotations
identify both pickable objects and placement locations, providing structured
spatial guidance. Instead of traditional step-by-step planning, we employ
Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) as an imitation learning algorithm,
enabling the robotic arm to predict chunked action sequences from human
demonstrations. This facilitates smooth, adaptive, and data-driven
pick-and-place operations. We evaluate our system based on success rate and
visual analysis of grasping behavior, demonstrating improved grasp accuracy and
adaptability in retail environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能从单个不完美的演示中快速泛化到不同问题，而机器人需要大量示例且泛化能力有限。作者认为这是由于机器人无法恢复支撑智能行为的潜在解释。

Method: RIR通过分层生成模型推断潜在程序，结合视觉语言模型和规划器进行贝叶斯程序归纳，生成可执行的程序。

Result: 在连续操作任务中，RIR仅需一次演示即可推断任务结构并泛化到新场景，表现优于现有视觉语言模型基线。

Conclusion: RIR框架通过推断潜在程序结构，显著提升了机器人从少量演示中泛化的能力。

Abstract: Humans can observe a single, imperfect demonstration and immediately
generalize to very different problem settings. Robots, in contrast, often
require hundreds of examples and still struggle to generalize beyond the
training conditions. We argue that this limitation arises from the inability to
recover the latent explanations that underpin intelligent behavior, and that
these explanations can take the form of structured programs consisting of
high-level goals, sub-task decomposition, and execution constraints. In this
work, we introduce Rational Inverse Reasoning (RIR), a framework for inferring
these latent programs through a hierarchical generative model of behavior. RIR
frames few-shot imitation as Bayesian program induction: a vision-language
model iteratively proposes structured symbolic task hypotheses, while a
planner-in-the-loop inference scheme scores each by the likelihood of the
observed demonstration under that hypothesis. This loop yields a posterior over
concise, executable programs. We evaluate RIR on a suite of continuous
manipulation tasks designed to test one-shot and few-shot generalization across
variations in object pose, count, geometry, and layout. With as little as one
demonstration, RIR infers the intended task structure and generalizes to novel
settings, outperforming state-of-the-art vision-language model baselines.

TL;DR: SCOPE方法通过稀疏余弦变换降低游戏状态输入维度，提升进化算法在游戏领域的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏领域的状态空间庞大，传统进化方法因参数增加导致收敛速度下降，需降低输入维度。

Method: SCOPE利用离散余弦变换（DCT）作为伪注意力机制，截断并稀疏化系数矩阵以减少输入维度。

Result: 在Atari游戏Space Invaders中，SCOPE结合CMA-ES优于其他进化方法和简单强化学习方法。

Conclusion: SCOPE通过降维和稀疏化有效提升了进化算法在游戏领域的性能。

Abstract: Evolutionary approaches have previously been shown to be effective learning
methods for a diverse set of domains. However, the domain of game-playing poses
a particular challenge for evolutionary methods due to the inherently large
state space of video games. As the size of the input state expands, the size of
the policy must also increase in order to effectively learn the temporal
patterns in the game space. Consequently, a larger policy must contain more
trainable parameters, exponentially increasing the size of the search space.
Any increase in search space is highly problematic for evolutionary methods, as
increasing the number of trainable parameters is inversely correlated with
convergence speed. To reduce the size of the input space while maintaining a
meaningful representation of the original space, we introduce Sparse Cosine
Optimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT) as a pseudo attention mechanism, transforming an input state
into a coefficient matrix. By truncating and applying sparsification to this
matrix, we reduce the dimensionality of the input space while retaining the
highest energy features of the original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of SCOPE as the policy for the Atari game Space Invaders. In this task, SCOPE
with CMA-ES outperforms evolutionary methods that consider an unmodified input
state, such as OpenAI-ES and HyperNEAT. SCOPE also outperforms simple
reinforcement learning methods, such as DQN and A3C. SCOPE achieves this result
through reducing the input size by 53% from 33,600 to 15,625 then using a
bilinear affine mapping of sparse DCT coefficients to policy actions learned by
the CMA-ES algorithm.

TL;DR: EGGCodec是一种用于EGG信号重建和F0提取的神经Encodec框架，通过多尺度频域损失函数和时间域相关损失提升性能，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Encodec模型直接从特征中提取F0，而EGGCodec利用重建的EGG信号更接近F0，同时简化训练流程。

Method: 提出多尺度频域损失函数和时间域相关损失，移除GAN判别器以简化训练。

Result: 在广泛使用的EGG数据集上，EGGCodec将MAE从14.14 Hz降至13.69 Hz，VDE提升38.2%。

Conclusion: EGGCodec在F0提取和信号重建方面表现优异，各组件通过消融实验验证其贡献。

Abstract: This letter introduces EGGCodec, a robust neural Encodec framework engineered
for electroglottography (EGG) signal reconstruction and F0 extraction. We
propose a multi-scale frequency-domain loss function to capture the nuanced
relationship between original and reconstructed EGG signals, complemented by a
time-domain correlation loss to improve generalization and accuracy. Unlike
conventional Encodec models that extract F0 directly from features, EGGCodec
leverages reconstructed EGG signals, which more closely correspond to F0. By
removing the conventional GAN discriminator, we streamline EGGCodec's training
process without compromising efficiency, incurring only negligible performance
degradation. Trained on a widely used EGG-inclusive dataset, extensive
evaluations demonstrate that EGGCodec outperforms state-of-the-art F0
extraction schemes, reducing mean absolute error (MAE) from 14.14 Hz to 13.69
Hz, and improving voicing decision error (VDE) by 38.2\%. Moreover, extensive
ablation experiments validate the contribution of each component of EGGCodec.

TL;DR: SafeKV是一种隐私感知的KV缓存管理框架，通过选择性共享非敏感条目和隔离敏感内容，有效减少时序侧信道攻击，同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全局KV缓存共享虽然加速了LLM推理，但引入了时序侧信道攻击风险，现有防御方法（如用户隔离）性能下降显著。

Method: SafeKV采用混合多级检测管道、统一基数树索引和基于熵的访问监控，选择性管理公共和私有缓存条目。

Result: SafeKV减少了94%-97%的时序攻击，TTFT提升40.58%，吞吐量提升2.66倍，缓存开销从50.41%降至11.74%。

Conclusion: SafeKV在保持高性能的同时，为LLM推理提供了强大的运行时隐私保障。

Abstract: Global KV-cache sharing has emerged as a key optimization for accelerating
large language model (LLM) inference. However, it exposes a new class of timing
side-channel attacks, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive user inputs via
shared cache entries. Existing defenses, such as per-user isolation, eliminate
leakage but degrade performance by up to 38.9% in time-to-first-token (TTFT),
making them impractical for high-throughput deployment. To address this gap, we
introduce SafeKV (Secure and Flexible KV Cache Sharing), a privacy-aware
KV-cache management framework that selectively shares non-sensitive entries
while confining sensitive content to private caches. SafeKV comprises three
components: (i) a hybrid, multi-tier detection pipeline that integrates
rule-based pattern matching, a general-purpose privacy detector, and
context-aware validation; (ii) a unified radix-tree index that manages public
and private entries across heterogeneous memory tiers (HBM, DRAM, SSD); and
(iii) entropy-based access monitoring to detect and mitigate residual
information leakage. Our evaluation shows that SafeKV mitigates 94% - 97% of
timing-based side-channel attacks. Compared to per-user isolation method,
SafeKV improves TTFT by up to 40.58% and throughput by up to 2.66X across
diverse LLMs and workloads. SafeKV reduces cache-induced TTFT overhead from
50.41% to 11.74% on Qwen3-235B. By combining fine-grained privacy control with
high cache reuse efficiency, SafeKV reclaims the performance advantages of
global sharing while providing robust runtime privacy guarantees for LLM
inference.

*Ikram Messadi,Giulia Cervia,Vincent Itier*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了图像数据中的信息泄漏问题，提出使用互信息估计器（如经验估计器和MINE框架）来检测选择性加密图像中的泄漏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数字数据传输规模的扩大，隐私问题日益紧迫，但隐私仍是一个社会构建且模糊定义的概念，缺乏普遍接受的量化标准。

Method: 结合深度学习、信息论和密码学，研究互信息估计器在检测图像信息泄漏中的应用，重点关注空间依赖性和残留结构。

Result: 研究表明，互信息估计器能够有效检测选择性加密图像中的信息泄漏。

Conclusion: 该工作为图像信息泄漏估计提供了一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: As digital data transmission continues to scale, concerns about privacy grow
increasingly urgent - yet privacy remains a socially constructed and
ambiguously defined concept, lacking a universally accepted quantitative
measure. This work examines information leakage in image data, a domain where
information-theoretic guarantees are still underexplored. At the intersection
of deep learning, information theory, and cryptography, we investigate the use
of mutual information (MI) estimators - in particular, the empirical estimator
and the MINE framework - to detect leakage from selectively encrypted images.
Motivated by the intuition that a robust estimator would require a
probabilistic frameworks that can capture spatial dependencies and residual
structures, even within encrypted representations - our work represent a
promising direction for image information leakage estimation.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种AI安全地图，全面组织AI安全相关元素及其对信息系统和利益相关者的负面影响，帮助理解其关系和应对措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究局限于特定领域或AI元素，难以理解其关系及对利益相关者的负面影响，因此需要一种全面组织AI安全知识、技术和社会影响的方法。

Method: 开发了一个AI安全地图，分为信息系统方面（ISA）和外部影响方面（EIA），分类并识别了各元素的负面影响。

Result: 通过AI安全地图，可以理解潜在负面影响、原因及对策，并明确AI系统负面影响与利益相关者的关系。

Conclusion: AI安全地图为未来AI安全社区提供了新的发现、建议和开放问题。

Abstract: As the social implementation of AI has been steadily progressing, research
and development related to AI security has also been increasing. However,
existing studies have been limited to organizing related techniques, attacks,
defenses, and risks in terms of specific domains or AI elements. Thus, it
extremely difficult to understand the relationships among them and how negative
impacts on stakeholders are brought about. In this paper, we argue that the
knowledge, technologies, and social impacts related to AI security should be
holistically organized to help understand relationships among them. To this
end, we first develop an AI security map that holistically organizes
interrelationships among elements related to AI security as well as negative
impacts on information systems and stakeholders. This map consists of the two
aspects, namely the information system aspect (ISA) and the external influence
aspect (EIA). The elements that AI should fulfill within information systems
are classified under the ISA. The EIA includes elements that affect
stakeholders as a result of AI being attacked or misused. For each element,
corresponding negative impacts are identified. By referring to the AI security
map, one can understand the potential negative impacts, along with their causes
and countermeasures. Additionally, our map helps clarify how the negative
impacts on AI-based systems relate to those on stakeholders. We show some
findings newly obtained by referring to our map. We also provide several
recommendations and open problems to guide future AI security communities.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于生成式AI（GenAI）的异常检测系统（ADS），用于解决IEC61850数字变电站中的网络安全挑战，特别是针对GOOSE协议的漏洞。通过先进的对抗流量变异（AATM）技术生成合成数据集，并结合任务导向对话（ToD）过程，展示了GenAI-ADS在性能上的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字变电站中的网络安全事件对电力系统的持续运行构成重大威胁，传统异常检测系统（ADSs）在检测威胁方面存在局限性。

Method: 利用生成式AI（GenAI）开发ADS，采用AATM技术生成合成数据集，并结合ToD过程改进攻击模式检测。

Result: GenAI-ADS在性能上优于基于机器学习的ADS，特别是在处理AATM生成的GOOSE数据集时表现更佳。

Conclusion: GenAI-ADS为解决数字变电站中的网络安全挑战提供了一种有效且创新的解决方案。

Abstract: In digital substations, security events pose significant challenges to the
sustained operation of power systems. To mitigate these challenges, the
implementation of robust defense strategies is critically important. A thorough
process of anomaly identification and detection in information and
communication technology (ICT) frameworks is crucial to ensure secure and
reliable communication and coordination between interconnected devices within
digital substations. Hence, this paper addresses the critical cybersecurity
challenges confronting IEC61850-based digital substations within modern smart
grids, where the integration of advanced communication protocols, e.g., generic
object-oriented substation event (GOOSE), has enhanced energy management and
introduced significant vulnerabilities to cyberattacks. Focusing on the
limitations of traditional anomaly detection systems (ADSs) in detecting
threats, this research proposes a transformative approach by leveraging
generative AI (GenAI) to develop robust ADSs. The primary contributions include
the suggested advanced adversarial traffic mutation (AATM) technique to
generate synthesized and balanced datasets for GOOSE messages, ensuring
protocol compliance and enabling realistic zero-day attack pattern creation to
address data scarcity. Then, the implementation of GenAI-based ADSs
incorporating the task-oriented dialogue (ToD) processes has been explored for
improved detection of attack patterns. Finally, a comparison of the GenAI-based
ADS with machine learning (ML)-based ADSs has been implemented to showcase the
outperformance of the GenAI-based frameworks considering the AATM-generated
GOOSE datasets and standard/advanced performance evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）的指纹攻击与防御方法，提出了一种基于强化学习的攻击方法和一种语义保持的输出过滤防御策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在敏感环境中的部署增加，指纹攻击带来了显著的隐私和安全风险，需要研究有效的攻击和防御方法。

Method: 攻击方法使用强化学习优化查询选择；防御方法通过次级LLM进行语义保持的输出过滤。

Result: 攻击方法仅需3次查询即可提高指纹识别准确率；防御方法在保持输出质量的同时降低了指纹识别准确率。

Conclusion: 研究展示了提升指纹工具能力的潜力，并提供了实用的防御策略。

Abstract: As large language models are increasingly deployed in sensitive environments,
fingerprinting attacks pose significant privacy and security risks. We present
a study of LLM fingerprinting from both offensive and defensive perspectives.
Our attack methodology uses reinforcement learning to automatically optimize
query selection, achieving better fingerprinting accuracy with only 3 queries
compared to randomly selecting 3 queries from the same pool. Our defensive
approach employs semantic-preserving output filtering through a secondary LLM
to obfuscate model identity while maintaining semantic integrity. The defensive
method reduces fingerprinting accuracy across tested models while preserving
output quality. These contributions show the potential to improve
fingerprinting tools capabilities while providing practical mitigation
strategies against fingerprinting attacks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的分布式入侵检测系统，通过最大化已知攻击知识的可迁移性关系，提升对未知攻击的防御能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 入侵检测系统（IDS）是网络设备的重要组成部分，但现有系统对未知攻击的防御能力有限。本文旨在利用已知攻击知识提升深度学习模型对未知攻击的检测能力。

Method: 提出了一种卷积神经网络（CNN）模型，并开发了两步数据预处理算法和基于块的智能聚合（BBSA）算法，以最大化可迁移性关系。

Conclusion: 该方法通过最大化可迁移性关系，有效提升了入侵检测系统对未知攻击的防御能力，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are a vital part of a network-connected
device. In this paper, we develop a deep learning based intrusion detection
system that is deployed in a distributed setup across devices connected to a
network. Our aim is to better equip deep learning models against unknown
attacks using knowledge from known attacks. To this end, we develop algorithms
to maximize the number of transferability relationships. We propose a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, along with two algorithms that
maximize the number of relationships observed. One is a two step data
pre-processing stage, and the other is a Block-Based Smart Aggregation (BBSA)
algorithm. The proposed system succeeds in achieving superior transferability
performance while maintaining impressive local detection rates. We also show
that our method is generalizable, exhibiting transferability potential across
datasets and even with different backbones. The code for this work can be found

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: EditMF是一种无需训练的指纹嵌入方法，通过加密知识库中的语义三元组实现高效且隐蔽的模型所有权验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护大型语言模型（LLM）的知识产权，现有方法在隐蔽性和效率上存在不足。

Method: 利用加密知识库中的语义三元组，通过因果追踪和零空间更新嵌入指纹，无需训练。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen模型上验证，EditMF隐蔽性高且性能损失极小，鲁棒性远超LoRA方法。

Conclusion: EditMF是一种高效、低开销的LLM所有权验证解决方案。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is resource-intensive and expensive,
making protecting intellectual property (IP) for LLMs crucial. Recently,
embedding fingerprints into LLMs has emerged as a prevalent method for
establishing model ownership. However, existing back-door-based methods suffer
from limited stealth and efficiency. To simultaneously address these issues, we
propose EditMF, a training-free fingerprinting paradigm that achieves highly
imperceptible fingerprint embedding with minimal computational overhead.
Ownership bits are mapped to compact, semantically coherent triples drawn from
an encrypted artificial knowledge base (e.g., virtual author-novel-protagonist
facts). Causal tracing localizes the minimal set of layers influencing each
triple, and a zero-space update injects the fingerprint without perturbing
unrelated knowledge. Verification requires only a single black-box query and
succeeds when the model returns the exact pre-embedded protagonist. Empirical
results on LLaMA and Qwen families show that EditMF combines high
imperceptibility with negligible model's performance loss, while delivering
robustness far beyond LoRA-based fingerprinting and approaching that of SFT
embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EditMF is an effective and
low-overhead solution for secure LLM ownership verification.

Motivation: 解决高维LOB成交量快照生成中的时序和流动性依赖模式问题。

Method: 使用条件扩散模型生成未来LOB成交量快照，并结合历史成交量和时间条件。

Result: 在真实性、反事实生成和下游预测任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiffVolume为LOB成交量生成提供了强大且灵活的框架。

Abstract: Modeling limit order books (LOBs) dynamics is a fundamental problem in market
microstructure research. In particular, generating high-dimensional volume
snapshots with strong temporal and liquidity-dependent patterns remains a
challenging task, despite recent work exploring the application of Generative
Adversarial Networks to LOBs. In this work, we propose a conditional
\textbf{Diff}usion model for the generation of future LOB \textbf{Volume}
snapshots (\textbf{DiffVolume}). We evaluate our model across three axes: (1)
\textit{Realism}, where we show that DiffVolume, conditioned on past volume
history and time of day, better reproduces statistical properties such as
marginal distribution, spatial correlation, and autocorrelation decay; (2)
\textit{Counterfactual generation}, allowing for controllable generation under
hypothetical liquidity scenarios by additionally conditioning on a target
future liquidity profile; and (3) \textit{Downstream prediction}, where we show
that the synthetic counterfactual data from our model improves the performance
of future liquidity forecasting models. Together, these results suggest that
DiffVolume provides a powerful and flexible framework for realistic and
controllable LOB volume generation.

TL;DR: SpectraLLM是一种大型语言模型，用于多模态光谱联合推理，实现端到端结构解析，显著优于单模态方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结构解析方法依赖先验数据库或专家知识，难以处理未知结构且成本高。

Method: SpectraLLM将连续和离散光谱模态整合到共享语义空间，学习跨光谱的子结构模式。

Result: 在六个公开化学数据集上达到最先进性能，单谱和多模态推理均表现优异。

Conclusion: SpectraLLM为结构解析提供了高效、鲁棒的解决方案，尤其在多模态场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Structure elucidation is a fundamental technique for understanding the
microscopic composition of matter and is widely applied across various
disciplines in the natural sciences and engineering. However, existing methods
often rely heavily on prior databases or known structural information, making
it difficult to resolve unknown structures. In addition, complex structures
typically require the joint analysis of multiple spectroscopic modalities. This
process heavily depends on expert domain knowledge and is often accompanied by
high costs in terms of both time and instrumentation. To address these
challenges, we propose SpectraLLM, the first large language model designed to
support multi-modal spectroscopic joint reasoning. SpectraLLM is capable of
processing either single or multiple spectroscopic inputs and performing
end-to-end structure elucidation. By integrating continuous and discrete
spectroscopic modalities into a shared semantic space, SpectraLLM learns to
uncover substructural patterns that are consistent and complementary across
spectra, enabling precise molecular structure elucidation. We pretrain and
fine-tune SpectraLLM in the domain of small molecules, and evaluate it on six
standardized, publicly available chemical datasets. The model achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing approaches
trained on single modalities. Notably, SpectraLLM demonstrates strong
robustness and generalization even for single-spectrum inference, while its
multi-modal reasoning capability further improves the accuracy of structural
prediction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应个性化对话信息检索方法APCIR，通过动态调整个性化级别和融合权重，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CIR系统对所有查询采用统一个性化策略，可能导致效果不佳，需根据查询需求动态调整个性化。

Method: 先识别查询所需的个性化级别，生成多种增强查询，再设计动态融合权重的排序方法。

Result: 在TREC iKAT数据集上验证，APCIR优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 自适应个性化策略能有效提升对话信息检索性能。

Abstract: Personalized conversational information retrieval (CIR) systems aim to
satisfy users' complex information needs through multi-turn interactions by
considering user profiles. However, not all search queries require
personalization. The challenge lies in appropriately incorporating
personalization elements into search when needed. Most existing studies
implicitly incorporate users' personal information and conversational context
using large language models without distinguishing the specific requirements
for each query turn. Such a ``one-size-fits-all'' personalization strategy
might lead to sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
personalization method, in which we first identify the required personalization
level for a query and integrate personalized queries with other query
reformulations to produce various enhanced queries. Then, we design a
personalization-aware ranking fusion approach to assign fusion weights
dynamically to different reformulated queries, depending on the required
personalization level. The proposed adaptive personalized conversational
information retrieval framework APCIR is evaluated on two TREC iKAT datasets.
The results confirm the effectiveness of adaptive personalization of APCIR by
outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: ReLSum是一个强化学习框架，用于生成优化的产品描述摘要，以提升电商搜索的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商搜索引擎仅依赖产品标题可能导致相关性预测不理想，因为标题信息不足。

Method: 提出ReLSum框架，利用强化学习生成简洁且与查询相关的摘要，并用于交叉编码器排序模型。

Result: 实验结果显示，离线指标（如召回率和NDCG）和在线用户参与度均有显著提升。

Conclusion: ReLSum为大规模电商系统提供了一种可扩展且高效的搜索相关性增强方案。

Abstract: E-commerce search engines often rely solely on product titles as input for
ranking models with latency constraints. However, this approach can result in
suboptimal relevance predictions, as product titles often lack sufficient
detail to capture query intent. While product descriptions provide richer
information, their verbosity and length make them unsuitable for real-time
ranking, particularly for computationally expensive architectures like
cross-encoder ranking models. To address this challenge, we propose ReLSum, a
novel reinforcement learning framework designed to generate concise,
query-relevant summaries of product descriptions optimized for search
relevance. ReLSum leverages relevance scores as rewards to align the objectives
of summarization and ranking, effectively overcoming limitations of prior
methods, such as misaligned learning targets. The framework employs a trainable
large language model (LLM) to produce summaries, which are then used as input
for a cross-encoder ranking model. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in offline metrics, including recall and NDCG, as well as online
user engagement metrics. ReLSum provides a scalable and efficient solution for
enhancing search relevance in large-scale e-commerce systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的时间感知用户画像方法（LLM-TUP），通过结合时间戳和自然语言表示，动态融合长短期偏好，显著提升了推荐系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有用户画像方法过于简单，无法捕捉长短期偏好的动态交互，限制了推荐系统的表现。

Method: 利用LLM生成用户历史的自然语言表示，结合BERT编码和时间注意力机制，动态融合长短期偏好。

Result: 在真实数据集上实验表明，LLM-TUP显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: LLM-TUP通过时间感知和语义丰富的用户画像，有效提升了内容推荐的个性化效果。

Abstract: Accurately modeling user preferences is crucial for improving the performance
of content-based recommender systems. Existing approaches often rely on
simplistic user profiling methods, such as averaging or concatenating item
embeddings, which fail to capture the nuanced nature of user preference
dynamics, particularly the interactions between long-term and short-term
preferences. In this work, we propose LLM-driven Temporal User Profiling
(LLM-TUP), a novel method for user profiling that explicitly models short-term
and long-term preferences by leveraging interaction timestamps and generating
natural language representations of user histories using a large language model
(LLM). These representations are encoded into high-dimensional embeddings using
a pre-trained BERT model, and an attention mechanism is applied to dynamically
fuse the short-term and long-term embeddings into a comprehensive user profile.
Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that LLM-TUP achieves
substantial improvements over several baselines, underscoring the effectiveness
of our temporally aware user-profiling approach and the use of semantically
rich user profiles, generated by LLMs, for personalized content-based
recommendation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统用户画像难以捕捉用户偏好的动态时间上下文因素，如短期兴趣和长期口味，因此需要更有效的动态用户理解方法。

Method: 研究通过LLMs生成语义丰富、时间感知的用户画像，动态融合短期和长期偏好，形成全面的用户嵌入。

Result: 在Movies&TV等密集领域效果显著，但在Video Games等稀疏环境中改进有限，效果依赖于用户交互历史的丰富程度。

Conclusion: LLMs在增强用户画像方面具有潜力，但实际效果受数据集特性影响，需根据领域特点灵活应用。

Abstract: Effective recommender systems demand dynamic user understanding, especially
in complex, evolving environments. Traditional user profiling often fails to
capture the nuanced, temporal contextual factors of user preferences, such as
transient short-term interests and enduring long-term tastes. This paper
presents an assessment of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating
semantically rich, time-aware user profiles. We do not propose a novel
end-to-end recommendation architecture; instead, the core contribution is a
systematic investigation into the degree of LLM effectiveness in capturing the
dynamics of user context by disentangling short-term and long-term preferences.
This approach, framing temporal preferences as dynamic user contexts for
recommendations, adaptively fuses these distinct contextual components into
comprehensive user embeddings. The evaluation across Movies&TV and Video Games
domains suggests that while LLM-generated profiles offer semantic depth and
temporal structure, their effectiveness for context-aware recommendations is
notably contingent on the richness of user interaction histories. Significant
gains are observed in dense domains (e.g., Movies&TV), whereas improvements are
less pronounced in sparse environments (e.g., Video Games). This work
highlights LLMs' nuanced potential in enhancing user profiling for adaptive,
context-aware recommendations, emphasizing the critical role of dataset
characteristics for practical applicability.

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1）从90天收听历史中构建自然语言用户档案，总结用户兴趣和行为模式；2）利用这些档案为LLM提供上下文，使其更有效地评估推荐内容与用户兴趣的匹配度。

Result: 在47名参与者的对照研究中，该方法与人类评估高度一致，且优于或等同于使用原始收听历史的变体。

Conclusion: 该框架为推荐系统提供了一种高效、可解释的评估方法，支持迭代测试和模型选择。

Abstract: Evaluating personalized recommendations remains a central challenge,
especially in long-form audio domains like podcasts, where traditional offline
metrics suffer from exposure bias and online methods such as A/B testing are
costly and operationally constrained. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as offline judges to
assess the quality of podcast recommendations in a scalable and interpretable
manner. Our two-stage profile-aware approach first constructs natural-language
user profiles distilled from 90 days of listening history. These profiles
summarize both topical interests and behavioral patterns, serving as compact,
interpretable representations of user preferences. Rather than prompting the
LLM with raw data, we use these profiles to provide high-level, semantically
rich context-enabling the LLM to reason more effectively about alignment
between a user's interests and recommended episodes. This reduces input
complexity and improves interpretability. The LLM is then prompted to deliver
fine-grained pointwise and pairwise judgments based on the profile-episode
match. In a controlled study with 47 participants, our profile-aware judge
matched human judgments with high fidelity and outperformed or matched a
variant using raw listening histories. The framework enables efficient,
profile-aware evaluation for iterative testing and model selection in
recommender systems.

Motivation: 当前多兴趣检索方法存在兴趣静态化、缺乏动态演化和主动探索的问题，限制了推荐系统的效果。

Method: 使用RQ-VAE构建离散兴趣空间，结合概率兴趣模块实现动态兴趣建模和软搜索策略。

Result: 在线A/B测试显示用户观看时长和页面浏览量显著提升，离线实验在召回率和NDCG指标上也有改进。

Conclusion: SPARC框架有效解决了多兴趣建模的挑战，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Modeling multi-interests has arisen as a core problem in real-world RS.
Current multi-interest retrieval methods pose three major challenges: 1)
Interests, typically extracted from predefined external knowledge, are
invariant. Failed to dynamically evolve with users' real-time consumption
preferences. 2) Online inference typically employs an over-exploited strategy,
mainly matching users' existing interests, lacking proactive exploration and
discovery of novel and long-tail interests. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel retrieval framework named SPARC(Soft Probabilistic Adaptive
Retrieval Model via Codebooks). Our contribution is two folds. First, the
framework utilizes Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) to
construct a discretized interest space. It achieves joint training of the
RQ-VAE with the industrial large scale recommendation model, mining
behavior-aware interests that can perceive user feedback and evolve
dynamically. Secondly, a probabilistic interest module that predicts the
probability distribution over the entire dynamic and discrete interest space.
This facilitates an efficient "soft-search" strategy during online inference,
revolutionizing the retrieval paradigm from "passive matching" to "proactive
exploration" and thereby effectively promoting interest discovery. Online A/B
tests on an industrial platform with tens of millions daily active users, have

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分离大型语言模型在云端和设备之间的方法（P/D-Device），以解决云端资源占用时间长和设备计算能力有限的问题，显著降低了首次响应时间（TTFT）并提高了云端吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业实践中，大型语言模型的解码阶段生成过多令牌会长期占用云端资源，影响吞吐量；同时，设备资源有限导致预填充阶段延迟（TTFT）随提示长度增加而显著上升。

Method: 通过分离云端和设备的预填充阶段，云端仅在预填充阶段辅助设备，设备在收到第一个令牌后立即响应，后续令牌通过速度控制器平滑输出，同时优化云端资源使用和设备推理速度。

Result: 实验表明，TTFT降低至少60%，最大TPOT为几十毫秒，云端吞吐量提升高达15倍。

Conclusion: P/D-Device方案有效解决了资源瓶颈问题，显著提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: Serving disaggregated large language models has been widely adopted in
industrial practice for enhanced performance. However, too many tokens
generated in decoding phase, i.e., occupying the resources for a long time,
essentially hamper the cloud from achieving a higher throughput. Meanwhile, due
to limited on-device resources, the time to first token (TTFT), i.e., the
latency of prefill phase, increases dramatically with the growth on prompt
length. In order to concur with such a bottleneck on resources, i.e., long
occupation in cloud and limited on-device computing capacity, we propose to
separate large language model between cloud and devices. That is, the cloud
helps a portion of the content for each device, only in its prefill phase.
Specifically, after receiving the first token from the cloud, decoupling with
its own prefill, the device responds to the user immediately for a lower TTFT.
Then, the following tokens from cloud are presented via a speed controller for
smoothed TPOT (the time per output token), until the device catches up with the
progress. On-device prefill is then amortized using received tokens while the
resource usage in cloud is controlled. Moreover, during cloud prefill, the
prompt can be refined, using those intermediate data already generated, to
further speed up on-device inference. We implement such a scheme P/D-Device,
and confirm its superiority over other alternatives. We further propose an
algorithm to decide the best settings. Real-trace experiments show that TTFT
decreases at least 60%, maximum TPOT is about tens of milliseconds, and cloud
throughput increases by up to 15x.

*Yuvraj Dutta,Soumyajit Chatterjee,Sandip Chakraborty,Basabdatta Palit*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文首次对5G边缘场景中联邦学习（FL）策略进行了全面基准测试，评估了三种聚合算法和四种时间序列架构在非独立同分布数据下的性能，发现FedBN在非IID条件下表现稳健，LSTM和Transformer模型优于CNN基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G和6G网络中，准确和自适应的网络吞吐量预测对延迟敏感和高带宽应用至关重要。现有方法多为集中式训练，难以适应异构移动环境中的非IID数据分布。

Method: 评估了三种FL聚合算法（FedAvg、FedProx、FedBN）和四种时间序列架构（LSTM、CNN、CNN+LSTM、Transformer），使用五个真实数据集，分析客户端异质性、队列大小和历史窗口长度对性能的影响。

Result: FedBN在非IID条件下表现稳健；LSTM和Transformer模型比CNN基线R2分数高80%；Transformer收敛速度更快但需要更长历史窗口；LSTM在准确性、轮次和时间占用上表现平衡。

Conclusion: FedBN结合LSTM或Transformer模型在自适应流媒体中显著提升QoE分数，为下一代无线网络中构建可扩展、隐私保护且边缘感知的吞吐量预测系统提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Accurate and adaptive network throughput prediction is essential for
latency-sensitive and bandwidth-intensive applications in 5G and emerging 6G
networks. However, most existing methods rely on centralized training with
uniformly collected data, limiting their applicability in heterogeneous mobile
environments with non-IID data distributions. This paper presents the first
comprehensive benchmarking of federated learning (FL) strategies for throughput
prediction in realistic 5G edge scenarios. We evaluate three aggregation
algorithms - FedAvg, FedProx, and FedBN - across four time-series
architectures: LSTM, CNN, CNN+LSTM, and Transformer, using five diverse
real-world datasets. We systematically analyze the effects of client
heterogeneity, cohort size, and history window length on prediction
performance. Our results reveal key trade-offs among model complexities,
convergence rates, and generalization. It is found that FedBN consistently
delivers robust performance under non-IID conditions. On the other hand, LSTM
and Transformer models outperform CNN-based baselines by up to 80% in R2
scores. Moreover, although Transformers converge in half the rounds of LSTM,
they require longer history windows to achieve a high R2, indicating higher
context dependence. LSTM is, therefore, found to achieve a favorable balance
between accuracy, rounds, and temporal footprint. To validate the end-to-end
applicability of the framework, we have integrated our FL-based predictors into
a live adaptive streaming pipeline. It is seen that FedBN-based LSTM and
Transformer models improve mean QoE scores by 11.7% and 11.4%, respectively,
over FedAvg, while also reducing the variance. These findings offer actionable
insights for building scalable, privacy-preserving, and edge-aware throughput
prediction systems in next-generation wireless networks.

Motivation: 研究公共事务决策中动态偏好对福利优化的影响，解决计算复杂性和公平性问题。

Method: 采用计算复杂度分析、近似算法、在线算法竞争比分析及策略行为研究。

Result: 功利主义福利优化计算简单，平均主义福利优化复杂但部分情况可高效解决；时间公平性影响社会福利；在线算法竞争比和策略行为分析提供新见解。

Conclusion: 动态偏好下的公共事务投票模型在福利优化和公平性方面具有挑战性，但部分问题可通过算法和策略分析解决。

Abstract: We study a temporal voting model where voters have dynamic preferences over a
set of public chores -- projects that benefit society, but impose individual
costs on those affected by their implementation. We investigate the
computational complexity of optimizing utilitarian and egalitarian welfare. Our
results show that while optimizing the former is computationally
straightforward, minimizing the latter is computationally intractable, even in
very restricted cases. Nevertheless, we identify several settings where this
problem can be solved efficiently, either exactly or by an approximation
algorithm. We also examine the effects of enforcing temporal fairness and its
impact on social welfare, and analyze the competitive ratio of online
algorithms. We then explore the strategic behavior of agents, providing
insights into potential malfeasance in such decision-making environments.
Finally, we discuss a range of fairness measures and their suitability for our
setting.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于LLM的框架，用于模拟美国公民对中国的态度演变，揭示了媒体偏见对国际观点形成的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是利用LLM的推理能力，模拟大规模、长期的跨国认知行为，填补了现有研究在模拟国家间态度演变方面的空白。

Method: 方法包括媒体数据收集、用户画像创建、认知架构设计，并利用LLM实现去偏见的媒体内容提取和“魔鬼代言人”代理。

Result: 成功复现了2005年至今美国对华态度的真实趋势，揭示了媒体偏见和选择偏差对观点极化的影响。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM在跨国社会认知建模中提供了新范式，有助于减少偏见和促进跨文化理解。

Abstract: The rise of LLMs poses new possibilities in modeling opinion evolution, a
long-standing task in simulation, by leveraging advanced reasoning abilities to
recreate complex, large-scale human cognitive trends. While most prior works
focus on opinion evolution surrounding specific isolated events or the views
within a country, ours is the first to model the large-scale attitude evolution
of a population representing an entire country towards another -- US citizens'
perspectives towards China. To tackle the challenges of this broad scenario, we
propose a framework that integrates media data collection, user profile
creation, and cognitive architecture for opinion updates to successfully
reproduce the real trend of US attitudes towards China over a 20-year period
from 2005 to today. We also leverage LLMs' capabilities to introduce debiased
media exposure, extracting neutral events from typically subjective news
contents, to uncover the roots of polarized opinion formation, as well as a
devils advocate agent to help explain the rare reversal from negative to
positive attitudes towards China, corresponding with changes in the way
Americans obtain information about the country. The simulation results, beyond
validating our framework architecture, also reveal the impact of biased framing
and selection bias in shaping attitudes. Overall, our work contributes to a new
paradigm for LLM-based modeling of cognitive behaviors in a large-scale,
long-term, cross-border social context, providing insights into the formation
of international biases and offering valuable implications for media consumers
to better understand the factors shaping their perspectives, and ultimately
contributing to the larger social need for bias reduction and cross-cultural
tolerance.

Motivation: 由于组合优化问题（COP）的解空间中存在大量局部最优解，难以求解。本文旨在扩展HC变换方法至UBQP，以平滑解空间。

Method: 构造单峰玩具UBQP，理论证明其单峰性，并应用于平滑原始UBQP。提出LSILS算法框架及其并行变体PC-LSILS。

Result: 实验验证了LSILS和PC-LSILS在UBQP和TSP上的有效性，PC-LSILS进一步提升了平滑效果和算法性能。

Conclusion: 本文方法成功扩展了HC变换至UBQP，并通过LSILS和PC-LSILS显著提升了算法性能。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problem (COP) is difficult to solve because of the
massive number of local optimal solutions in his solution space. Various
methods have been put forward to smooth the solution space of COPs, including
homotopic convex (HC) transformation for the traveling salesman problem (TSP).
This paper extends the HC transformation approach to unconstrained binary
quadratic programming (UBQP) by proposing a method to construct a unimodal toy
UBQP of any size. We theoretically prove the unimodality of the constructed toy
UBQP. After that, we apply this unimodal toy UBQP to smooth the original UBQP
by using the HC transformation framework and empirically verify the smoothing
effects. Subsequently, we introduce an iterative algorithmic framework
incorporating HC transformation, referred as landscape smoothing iterated local
search (LSILS). Our experimental analyses, conducted on various UBQP instances
show the effectiveness of LSILS. Furthermore, this paper proposes a parallel
cooperative variant of LSILS, denoted as PC-LSILS and apply it to both the UBQP
and the TSP. Our experimental findings highlight that PC-LSILS improves the
smoothing performance of the HC transformation, and further improves the
overall performance of the algorithm.

Motivation: 探索不同玩具UBQP对平滑UBQP崎岖地形的效果，以优化LSILS算法的性能。

Method: 评估三种玩具UBQP（^Q1、^Q2、^Q3）的地形平坦度，并测试其在LSILS中的效率。

Result: ^Q1地形最平坦，^Q3最不平坦；LSILS使用^Q2效果最佳，^Q3效果最差。

Conclusion: 研究为UBQP优化中的地形平滑技术提供了详细见解。

Abstract: The hardness of the Unconstrained Binary Quadratic Program (UBQP) problem is
due its rugged landscape. Various algorithms have been proposed for UBQP,
including the Landscape Smoothing Iterated Local Search (LSILS). Different from
other UBQP algorithms, LSILS tries to smooth the rugged landscape by building a
convex combination of the original UBQP and a toy UBQP. In this paper, our
study further investigates the impact of smoothing rugged landscapes using
different toy UBQP problems, including a toy UBQP with matrix ^Q1 (construct by
"+/-1"), a toy UBQP with matrix ^Q2 (construct by "+/-i") and a toy UBQP with
matrix ^Q3 (construct randomly). We first assess the landscape flatness of the
three toy UBQPs. Subsequently, we test the efficiency of LSILS with different
toy UBQPs. Results reveal that the toy UBQP with ^Q1 (construct by "+/-1")
exhibits the flattest landscape among the three, while the toy UBQP with ^Q3
(construct randomly) presents the most non-flat landscape. Notably, LSILS using
the toy UBQP with ^Q2 (construct by "+/-i") emerges as the most effective,
while ^Q3 (construct randomly) has the poorest result. These findings
contribute to a detailed understanding of landscape smoothing techniques in
optimizing UBQP.

Motivation: 室内光照估计因场景光照的时空变化而极具挑战性，现有方法难以处理。

Method: 利用2D扩散先验优化MLP表示的光场，微调预训练扩散模型以预测多位置光照。

Result: 在单图像或视频的室内光照估计中表现优于基线方法，尤其在时空一致性光照估计上表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂场景下实现了高质量的时空一致性光照估计，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Indoor lighting estimation from a single image or video remains a challenge
due to its highly ill-posed nature, especially when the lighting condition of
the scene varies spatially and temporally. We propose a method that estimates
from an input video a continuous light field describing the spatiotemporally
varying lighting of the scene. We leverage 2D diffusion priors for optimizing
such light field represented as a MLP. To enable zero-shot generalization to
in-the-wild scenes, we fine-tune a pre-trained image diffusion model to predict
lighting at multiple locations by jointly inpainting multiple chrome balls as
light probes. We evaluate our method on indoor lighting estimation from a
single image or video and show superior performance over compared baselines.
Most importantly, we highlight results on spatiotemporally consistent lighting
estimation from in-the-wild videos, which is rarely demonstrated in previous
works.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种面部表情重定向方法，通过统一框架和精细校准，解决了从真人到虚拟角色的语义匹配问题，并引入微调技术优化控制效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决面部表情重定向中语义匹配的困难，特别是在从真人到游戏或虚拟现实（VR）角色的场景中。

Method: 使用统一的面部框架（如3DMM、FLAME等），通过体积变形和Simon-Says表达式校准，并引入基于隐式微分的优化方法。

Result: 校准后的框架能生成期望的表情，但在跟踪性能时仍需微调以优化控制语义。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过统一框架和微调技术，实现了高效的面部表情重定向，尤其适用于游戏和VR场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider retargeting a tracked facial performance to either
another person or to a virtual character in a game or virtual reality (VR)
environment. We remove the difficulties associated with identifying and
retargeting the semantics of one rig framework to another by utilizing the same
framework (3DMM, FLAME, MetaHuman, etc.) for both subjects. Although this does
not constrain the choice of framework when retargeting from one person to
another, it does force the tracker to use the game/VR character rig when
retargeting to a game/VR character. We utilize volumetric morphing in order to
fit facial rigs to both performers and targets; in addition, a carefully chosen
set of Simon-Says expressions is used to calibrate each rig to the motion
signatures of the relevant performer or target. Although a uniform set of
Simon-Says expressions can likely be used for all person to person retargeting,
we argue that person to game/VR character retargeting benefits from Simon-Says
expressions that capture the distinct motion signature of the game/VR character
rig. The Simon-Says calibrated rigs tend to produce the desired expressions
when exercising animation controls (as expected). Unfortunately, these
well-calibrated rigs still lead to undesirable controls when tracking a
performance (a well-behaved function can have an arbitrarily ill-conditioned
inverse), even though they typically produce acceptable geometry
reconstructions. Thus, we propose a fine-tuning approach that modifies the rig
used by the tracker in order to promote the output of more semantically
meaningful animation controls, facilitating high efficacy retargeting. In order
to better address real-world scenarios, the fine-tuning relies on implicit
differentiation so that the tracker can be treated as a (potentially
non-differentiable) black box.

Motivation: 现有滤波方法存在点聚类或噪声残留问题，需改进。

Method: 设计并行模块（ShortModule和LongModule）分别处理短程分数和长程流，采用动态图卷积解码器优化推理。

Result: HybridPF在去噪效果和推理速度上达到最优。

Conclusion: HybridPF通过结合短程和长程信息，显著提升了点云滤波性能。

Abstract: Point cloud capture processes are error-prone and introduce noisy artifacts
that necessitate filtering/denoising. Recent filtering methods often suffer
from point clustering or noise retaining issues. In this paper, we propose
Hybrid Point Cloud Filtering ($\textbf{HybridPF}$) that considers both
short-range and long-range filtering trajectories when removing noise. It is
well established that short range scores, given by $\nabla_{x}\log p(x_t)$, may
provide the necessary displacements to move noisy points to the underlying
clean surface. By contrast, long range velocity flows approximate constant
displacements directed from a high noise variant patch $x_0$ towards the
corresponding clean surface $x_1$. Here, noisy patches $x_t$ are viewed as
intermediate states between the high noise variant and the clean patches. Our
intuition is that long range information from velocity flow models can guide
the short range scores to align more closely with the clean points. In turn,
score models generally provide a quicker convergence to the clean surface.
Specifically, we devise two parallel modules, the ShortModule and LongModule,
each consisting of an Encoder-Decoder pair to respectively account for
short-range scores and long-range flows. We find that short-range scores,
guided by long-range features, yield filtered point clouds with good point
distributions and convergence near the clean surface. We design a joint loss
function to simultaneously train the ShortModule and LongModule, in an
end-to-end manner. Finally, we identify a key weakness in current displacement
based methods, limitations on the decoder architecture, and propose a dynamic
graph convolutional decoder to improve the inference process. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our HybridPF achieves state-of-the-art results
while enabling faster inference speed.

Abstract: With the advent of diffusion models, Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has seen
substantial advancements. Current T2I models allow users to specify object
colors using linguistic color names, and some methods aim to personalize
color-object association through prompt learning. However, existing models
struggle to provide comprehensive control over the color schemes of an entire
image, especially for background elements and less prominent objects not
explicitly mentioned in prompts. This paper proposes a novel approach to
enhance color scheme control by integrating color palettes as a separate
guidance mechanism alongside prompt instructions. We investigate the
effectiveness of palette guidance by exploring various palette representation
methods within a diffusion-based image colorization framework. To facilitate
this exploration, we construct specialized palette-text-image datasets and
conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses. Our results
demonstrate that incorporating palette guidance significantly improves the
model's ability to generate images with desired color schemes, enabling a more
controlled and refined colorization process.

Abstract: We introduce DiffPhysCam, a differentiable camera simulator designed to
support robotics and embodied AI applications by enabling gradient-based
optimization in visual perception pipelines. Generating synthetic images that
closely mimic those from real cameras is essential for training visual models
and enabling end-to-end visuomotor learning. Moreover, differentiable rendering
allows inverse reconstruction of real-world scenes as digital twins,
facilitating simulation-based robotics training. However, existing virtual
cameras offer limited control over intrinsic settings, poorly capture optical
artifacts, and lack tunable calibration parameters -- hindering sim-to-real
transfer. DiffPhysCam addresses these limitations through a multi-stage
pipeline that provides fine-grained control over camera settings, models key
optical effects such as defocus blur, and supports calibration with real-world
data. It enables both forward rendering for image synthesis and inverse
rendering for 3D scene reconstruction, including mesh and material texture
optimization. We show that DiffPhysCam enhances robotic perception performance
in synthetic image tasks. As an illustrative example, we create a digital twin
of a real-world scene using inverse rendering, simulate it in a multi-physics
environment, and demonstrate navigation of an autonomous ground vehicle using
images generated by DiffPhysCam.

Abstract: We introduce VertexRegen, a novel mesh generation framework that enables

generate meshes in a partial-to-complete manner and thus intermediate steps of

progressive meshes and reformulates the process as the reversal of edge
collapse, i.e. vertex split, learned through a generative model. Experimental
results demonstrate that VertexRegen produces meshes of comparable quality to
state-of-the-art methods while uniquely offering anytime generation with the
flexibility to halt at any step to yield valid meshes with varying levels of

Result: 在SD3和FLUX.1-dev上表现优于现有方法，编辑质量和一致性达到SOTA，超越商业模型。

Conclusion: ColorCtrl在图像和视频编辑中表现出色，具有通用性和稳定性。

Abstract: Text-guided color editing in images and videos is a fundamental yet unsolved
problem, requiring fine-grained manipulation of color attributes, including
albedo, light source color, and ambient lighting, while preserving physical
consistency in geometry, material properties, and light-matter interactions.
Existing training-free methods offer broad applicability across editing tasks
but struggle with precise color control and often introduce visual
inconsistency in both edited and non-edited regions. In this work, we present
ColorCtrl, a training-free color editing method that leverages the attention
mechanisms of modern Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiT). By
disentangling structure and color through targeted manipulation of attention
maps and value tokens, our method enables accurate and consistent color
editing, along with word-level control of attribute intensity. Our method
modifies only the intended regions specified by the prompt, leaving unrelated
areas untouched. Extensive experiments on both SD3 and FLUX.1-dev demonstrate
that ColorCtrl outperforms existing training-free approaches and achieves
state-of-the-art performances in both edit quality and consistency.
Furthermore, our method surpasses strong commercial models such as FLUX.1
Kontext Max and GPT-4o Image Generation in terms of consistency. When extended
to video models like CogVideoX, our approach exhibits greater advantages,
particularly in maintaining temporal coherence and editing stability. Finally,
our method also generalizes to instruction-based editing diffusion models such
as Step1X-Edit and FLUX.1 Kontext dev, further demonstrating its versatility.

and is generalized to handle complex lighting and scenarios.
  From the neural network thinking of the solver to the rendering equation, we
present a novel network architecture to predict indirect illumination. Our
network is equipped with a modified attention mechanism that aggregates global
information guided by spacial geometry features, as well as a monochromatic
design that encodes each color channel individually.
  We conducted extensive evaluations, and the experimental results demonstrate
our superiority over previous learning-based techniques. Our approach excels at
handling complex lighting such as varying-colored lighting and environment
lighting. It can successfully capture distant indirect illumination and
simulates the interreflections between textured surfaces well (i.e., color
bleeding effects); it can also effectively handle new scenes that are not
present in the training dataset.

TL;DR: SharpXR是一种结构感知的双解码器U-Net，用于在低剂量儿科X射线中降噪并保留诊断相关特征，显著提升肺炎分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量儿科X射线在资源匮乏地区至关重要，但降噪方法常损害细节，影响诊断准确性。

Method: SharpXR结合拉普拉斯引导的边缘保留解码器和可学习融合模块，模拟Poisson-Gaussian噪声进行训练。

Result: SharpXR在所有评估指标上优于现有方法，并将肺炎分类准确率从88.8%提升至92.5%。

Conclusion: SharpXR在低资源儿科护理中具有显著诊断价值，且计算高效。

Abstract: Pediatric chest X-ray imaging is essential for early diagnosis, particularly
in low-resource settings where advanced imaging modalities are often
inaccessible. Low-dose protocols reduce radiation exposure in children but
introduce substantial noise that can obscure critical anatomical details.
Conventional denoising methods often degrade fine details, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we present SharpXR, a structure-aware
dual-decoder U-Net designed to denoise low-dose pediatric X-rays while
preserving diagnostically relevant features. SharpXR combines a
Laplacian-guided edge-preserving decoder with a learnable fusion module that
adaptively balances noise suppression and structural detail retention. To
address the scarcity of paired training data, we simulate realistic
Poisson-Gaussian noise on the Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray dataset. SharpXR
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all evaluation metrics while
maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained
settings. SharpXR-denoised images improved downstream pneumonia classification
accuracy from 88.8% to 92.5%, underscoring its diagnostic value in low-resource
pediatric care.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了传统方法的局限性，为生物医学成像提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to variational volume reconstruction from sparse,
noisy slice data using the Deep Ritz method. Motivated by biomedical imaging
applications such as MRI-based slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), our
approach addresses three key challenges: (i) the reliance on image segmentation
to extract boundaries from noisy grayscale slice images, (ii) the need to
reconstruct volumes from a limited number of slice planes, and (iii) the
computational expense of traditional mesh-based methods. We formulate a
variational objective that combines a regression loss designed to avoid image
segmentation by operating on noisy slice data directly with a modified
Cahn-Hilliard energy incorporating anisotropic diffusion to regularize the
reconstructed geometry. We discretize the phase field with a neural network,
approximate the objective at each optimization step with Monte Carlo
integration, and use ADAM to find the minimum of the approximated variational
objective. While the stochastic integration may not yield the true solution to
the variational problem, we demonstrate that our method reliably produces
high-quality reconstructed volumes in a matter of seconds, even when the slice
data is sparse and noisy.

Abstract: Spectral variability significantly impacts the accuracy and convergence of
hyperspectral unmixing algorithms. While many methods address complex spectral
variability, large-scale variations in spectral signature scale caused by
factors such as topography, illumination, and shadowing remain a major
challenge. These variations often degrade unmixing performance and complicate
model fitting. In this paper, we propose a novel preprocessing algorithm that
corrects scale-induced spectral variability prior to unmixing. By isolating and
compensating for these large-scale multiplicative effects, the algorithm
provides a cleaner input, enabling unmixing methods to focus more effectively
on modeling nonlinear spectral variability and abundance estimation. We present
a rigorous mathematical framework to describe scale variability and extensive
experimental validation of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the algorithm's
impact is evaluated across a broad spectrum of state-of-the-art unmixing
algorithms on two synthetic and two real hyperspectral datasets. The proposed
preprocessing step consistently improves the performance of these algorithms,
including those specifically designed to handle spectral variability, with
error reductions close to 50% in many cases. This demonstrates that scale
correction acts as a complementary step, facilitating more accurate unmixing by
existing methods. The algorithm's generality and significant impact highlight
its potential as a key component in practical hyperspectral unmixing pipelines.
The implementation code will be made publicly available upon publication.

*Yingxue Pang,Shijie Zhao,Haiqiang Wang,Gen Zhan,Junlin Li,Li Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于频率辅助的锐化级别预测模型（FreqSP），以优化视频质量和带宽成本之间的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 锐化技术虽能提升视频质量，但过高的锐化级别会导致视频比特率增加和服务质量下降，甚至出现过锐化问题。因此，需要找到既能提升视频质量又能控制带宽成本的合适锐化级别。

Method: 首先为每个视频标注与最优比特率和质量权衡相关的锐化级别作为真实标签，然后利用未压缩的源视频作为输入，通过CNN特征和高频分量预测最优锐化级别。

Result: 大量实验验证了FreqSP模型的有效性。

Conclusion: FreqSP模型能够有效预测最优锐化级别，平衡视频质量和带宽成本。

Abstract: Sharpening is a widely adopted technique to improve video quality, which can
effectively emphasize textures and alleviate blurring. However, increasing the
sharpening level comes with a higher video bitrate, resulting in degraded
Quality of Service (QoS). Furthermore, the video quality does not necessarily
improve with increasing sharpening levels, leading to issues such as
over-sharpening. Clearly, it is essential to figure out how to boost video
quality with a proper sharpening level while also controlling bandwidth costs
effectively. This paper thus proposes a novel Frequency-assisted Sharpening
level Prediction model (FreqSP). We first label each video with the sharpening
level correlating to the optimal bitrate and quality tradeoff as ground truth.
Then taking uncompressed source videos as inputs, the proposed FreqSP leverages
intricate CNN features and high-frequency components to estimate the optimal
sharpening level. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method.

Conclusion: 数据集的类型（真实或合成）对方法性能有显著影响，3D高斯泼溅在合成场景中表现优异，但在真实数据中不如帧插值方法。

Abstract: Many methods exist for frame synthesis in image sequences but can be broadly
categorised into frame interpolation and view synthesis techniques.
Fundamentally, both frame interpolation and view synthesis tackle the same
task, interpolating a frame given surrounding frames in time or space. However,
most frame interpolation datasets focus on temporal aspects with single cameras
moving through time and space, while view synthesis datasets are typically
biased toward stereoscopic depth estimation use cases. This makes direct
comparison between view synthesis and frame interpolation methods challenging.
In this paper, we develop a novel multi-camera dataset using a custom-built
dense linear camera array to enable fair comparison between these approaches.
We evaluate classical and deep learning frame interpolators against a view
synthesis method (3D Gaussian Splatting) for the task of view in-betweening.
Our results reveal that deep learning methods do not significantly outperform
classical methods on real image data, with 3D Gaussian Splatting actually
underperforming frame interpolators by as much as 3.5 dB PSNR. However, in
synthetic scenes, the situation reverses -- 3D Gaussian Splatting outperforms
frame interpolation algorithms by almost 5 dB PSNR at a 95% confidence level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估插值帧的感知质量是视频帧插值领域的研究重点，但现有方法在计算效率和相关性上仍有不足。

Method: 通过处理运动场并测量其发散性，提出了一种新的质量指标，并在BVI-VFI数据集上进行验证。

Result: 新指标与感知评分的相关性较好（PLCC=0.51），计算效率比FloLPIPS高2.7倍，且更倾向于感知上更优的插值帧。

Conclusion: 提出的运动场发散性指标是一种高效且与感知质量相关的视频帧插值评估方法。

Abstract: Video frame interpolation (VFI) offers a way to generate intermediate frames
between consecutive frames of a video sequence. Although the development of
advanced frame interpolation algorithms has received increased attention in
recent years, assessing the perceptual quality of interpolated content remains
an ongoing area of research. In this paper, we investigate simple ways to
process motion fields, with the purposes of using them as video quality metric
for evaluating frame interpolation algorithms. We evaluate these quality
metrics using the BVI-VFI dataset which contains perceptual scores measured for
interpolated sequences. From our investigation we propose a motion metric based
on measuring the divergence of motion fields. This metric correlates reasonably
with these perceptual scores (PLCC=0.51) and is more computationally efficient
(x2.7 speedup) compared to FloLPIPS (a well known motion-based metric). We then
use our new proposed metrics to evaluate a range of state of the art frame
interpolation metrics and find our metrics tend to favour more perceptual
pleasing interpolated frames that may not score highly in terms of PSNR or
SSIM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究基因扰动在不同细胞环境中的效应是功能基因组学的核心挑战，对治疗发现和精准医学有重要意义。

Method: CFM-GP利用流匹配目标学习未扰动和扰动基因表达分布之间的连续时间依赖转换，适用于所有细胞类型。

Result: 在五个数据集上，CFM-GP在R平方和Spearman相关性上均优于现有方法，并能恢复关键生物通路。

Conclusion: CFM-GP是一种稳健且具有生物保真度的跨细胞类型基因扰动预测方法。

Abstract: Understanding gene perturbation effects across diverse cellular contexts is a
central challenge in functional genomics, with important implications for
therapeutic discovery and precision medicine. Single-cell technologies enable
high-resolution measurement of transcriptional responses, but collecting such
data is costly and time-consuming, especially when repeated for each cell type.
Existing computational methods often require separate models per cell type,
limiting scalability and generalization. We present CFM-GP, a method for cell
type-agnostic gene perturbation prediction. CFM-GP learns a continuous,
time-dependent transformation between unperturbed and perturbed gene expression
distributions, conditioned on cell type, allowing a single model to predict
across all cell types. Unlike prior approaches that use discrete modeling,
CFM-GP employs a flow matching objective to capture perturbation dynamics in a
scalable manner. We evaluate on five datasets: SARS-CoV-2 infection, IFN-beta
stimulated PBMCs, glioblastoma treated with Panobinostat, lupus under IFN-beta
stimulation, and Statefate progenitor fate mapping. CFM-GP consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in R-squared and Spearman correlation,
and pathway enrichment analysis confirms recovery of key biological pathways.
These results demonstrate the robustness and biological fidelity of CFM-GP as a
scalable solution for cross-cell type gene perturbation prediction.
