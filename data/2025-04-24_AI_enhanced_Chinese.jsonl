We organize existing methods into three main categories according to\ntheir generalization capabilities: specialized, transferable, and general\nmodels. Specialized models focus on tasks where training and evaluation occur\nwithin the same data distribution. We introduce a hierarchical taxonomy for\nspecialized models based on the key aspects of tabular data -- features,\nsamples, and objectives -- and delve into detailed strategies for obtaining\nhigh-quality feature- and sample-level representations. Transferable models are\npre-trained on one or more datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on downstream\ntasks, leveraging knowledge acquired from homogeneous or heterogeneous sources,\nor even cross-modalities such as vision and language. General models, also\nknown as tabular foundation models, extend this concept further, allowing\ndirect application to downstream tasks without fine-tuning. We group these\ngeneral models based on the strategies used to adapt across heterogeneous\ndatasets. Additionally, we explore ensemble methods, which integrate the\nstrengths of multiple tabular models.

A key advantage of\nLiLaVe is its ability to operate with only a small fraction of the\ncomputational budget required by traditional LLM-based verifiers. To\ndemonstrate its practicality, we couple LiLaVe with popular meta-generation\nstrategies, like best-of-n or self-consistency. Moreover, we design novel\nLiLaVe-based approaches, like conditional self-correction or conditional\nmajority voting, that significantly improve both accuracy and efficiency in\ngeneration tasks with smaller LLMs. Our work demonstrates the fruitfulness of\nextracting latent information from the hidden states of LLMs, and opens the\ndoor to scalable and resource-efficient solutions for reasoning-intensive\napplications.", "AI": {"tldr": "LiLaVe\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u57fa\u7840LLM\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u5927\u578bLLM\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0cLiLaVe\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "LiLaVe\u4ece\u57fa\u7840LLM\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5143\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982best-of-n\u6216\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u6216\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u6761\u4ef6\u81ea\u6821\u6b63\u6216\u6761\u4ef6\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\uff09\u3002", "result": "LiLaVe\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5c0f\u578bLLM\u3002", "conclusion": "LiLaVe\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4eceLLM\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6f5c\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

The\nexisting representative approaches generally follow the research pipeline which\nmainly consists of three core procedures, including independent feature\nextraction for visual and linguistic modalities, respectively, cross-modal\ninteraction module, and independent prediction heads for different sub-tasks.\nAlbeit achieving remarkable performance, this research line has two\nlimitations: 1) The linguistic content has not been fully injected into the\nentire visual backbone for boosting more effective visual feature extraction\nand it needs an extra cross-modal interaction module; 2) The relationship\nbetween REC and RES tasks is not effectively exploited to help the\ncollaborative prediction for more accurate output. To deal with these problems,\nin this paper, we propose a Progressive Language-guided Visual Learning\nframework for multi-task visual grounding, called PLVL, which not only finely\nmine the inherent feature expression of the visual modality itself but also\nprogressively inject the language information to help learn linguistic-related\nvisual features. In this manner, our PLVL does not need additional cross-modal\nfusion module while fully introducing the language guidance. Furthermore, we\nanalyze that the localization center for REC would help identify the\nto-be-segmented object region for RES to some extent. Inspired by this\ninvestigation, we design a multi-task head to accomplish collaborative\npredictions for these two sub-tasks.

First, we create a\nlarge-scale dataset comprising 540K unique high-quality math problems,\nincluding olympiad-level problems, and their 3.2M long-reasoning solutions.\nSecond, we develop a novel method to integrate code execution with long\nreasoning models through iterative training, generation, and quality filtering,\nresulting in 1.7M high-quality Tool-Integrated Reasoning solutions. Third, we\ncreate a pipeline to train models to select the most promising solution from\nmany candidates.

The\ncurrent approach to recognition of ASL signs aims to translate RGB sign\nlanguage videos through pose information into English-based ID glosses, which\nserve to uniquely identify ASL signs.

This paper proposes SignX, a foundation model framework for sign\nrecognition. It is a concise yet powerful framework applicable to multiple\nhuman activity recognition scenarios. First, we developed a Pose2Gloss\ncomponent based on an inverse diffusion model, which contains a multi-track\npose fusion layer that unifies five of the most powerful pose information\nsources--SMPLer-X, DWPose, Mediapipe, PrimeDepth, and Sapiens\nSegmentation--into a single latent pose representation. Second, we trained a\nVideo2Pose module based on ViT that can directly convert raw video into signer\npose representation. Through this 2-stage training framework, we enable sign\nlanguage recognition models to be compatible with existing pose formats, laying\nthe foundation for the common pose estimation necessary for sign recognition.\nExperimental results show that SignX can recognize signs from sign language\nvideo, producing predicted gloss representations with greater accuracy than has\nbeen reported in prior work.", "AI": {"tldr": "SignX\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u624b\u8bed\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08Pose2Gloss\u548cVideo2Pose\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684ID glosses\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSignX\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u57fa\u4e8e\u9006\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684Pose2Gloss\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eViT\u7684Video2Pose\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSignX\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SignX\u4e3a\u624b\u8bed\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u517c\u5bb9\u73b0\u6709\u59ff\u6001\u683c\u5f0f\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

However, due to the inherent complexity of digital images, issues of\ninvisibility and security persist when using CNN models for information\nembedding. In this paper, we propose Curriculum Learning Progressive Steganophy\nNetwork (CLPSTNet). The network consists of multiple progressive multi-scale\nconvolutional modules that integrate Inception structures and dilated\nconvolutions. The module contains multiple branching pathways, starting from a\nsmaller convolutional kernel and dilatation rate, extracting the basic, local\nfeature information from the feature map, and gradually expanding to the\nconvolution with a larger convolutional kernel and dilatation rate for\nperceiving the feature information of a larger receptive field, so as to\nrealize the multi-scale feature extraction from shallow to deep, and from fine\nto coarse, allowing the shallow secret information features to be refined in\ndifferent fusion stages. The experimental results show that the proposed\nCLPSTNet not only has high PSNR , SSIM metrics and decoding accuracy on three\nlarge public datasets, ALASKA2, VOC2012 and ImageNet, but also the\nsteganographic images generated by CLPSTNet have low steganalysis scores.You\ncan find our code at\n\\href{https://github.com/chaos-boops/CLPSTNet}{https://github.com/chaos-boops/CLPSTNet}.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u9690\u5199\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CLPSTNet\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u9690\u5199\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9690\u5199\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u800cCNN\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u9690\u5199\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "CLPSTNet\u91c7\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Inception\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7a7a\u6d1e\u5377\u79ef\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u63d0\u53d6\u4ece\u7ec6\u5230\u7c97\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aCLPSTNet\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0cPSNR\u3001SSIM\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u9690\u5199\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4f4e\u9690\u5199\u5206\u6790\u5f97\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "CLPSTNet\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u9690\u5199\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We present a dynamic regret of\n$\\tilde{\\mathscr O}(|S|^{1/2}|A|^{1/2}\\Delta_T^{1/6}T^{5/6})$ for both\nalgorithms, where $T$ is the time horizon, and $|S|$, $|A|$ are the sizes of\nthe state and action spaces.

Many AI-driven threat detection systems rely on complex deep\nlearning models, which, despite their high accuracy, suffer from two major\ndrawbacks: lack of interpretability and high computational cost. Black-box AI\nmodels make it difficult for security analysts to understand the reasoning\nbehind their predictions, limiting their practical deployment. Moreover,\nconventional deep learning techniques demand significant computational\nresources, rendering them unsuitable for edge devices with limited processing\npower.

However, existing optimization methods exhibit significant\nshortcomings: regression-based losses like L1/L2 lack correlation with IoU,\nIoU-based losses are unstable and limited to simple shapes, and task-specific\nmethods are computationally intensive and not generalizable accross domains. As\na result, the current landscape of parametric shape objective functions has\nbecome scattered, with each domain proposing distinct IoU approximations. To\naddress this, we unify the parametric shape optimization objective functions by\nintroducing Marginalized Generalized IoU (MGIoU), a novel loss function that\novercomes these challenges by projecting structured convex shapes onto their\nunique shape Normals to compute one-dimensional normalized GIoU. MGIoU offers a\nsimple, efficient, fully differentiable approximation strongly correlated with\nIoU. We then extend MGIoU to MGIoU+ that supports optimizing unstructured\nconvex shapes. Together, MGIoU and MGIoU+ unify parametric shape optimization\nacross diverse applications. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate\nthat MGIoU and MGIoU+ consistently outperform existing losses while reducing\nloss computation latency by 10-40x.

However, irregular rain patterns and complex geometric overlaps\nchallenge single-paradigm architectures, necessitating a unified framework to\nintegrate complementary global-local and spatial-channel representations. To\naddress this, we propose a novel Cross Paradigm Representation and Alignment\nTransformer (CPRAformer). Its core idea is the hierarchical representation and\nalignment, leveraging the strengths of both paradigms (spatial-channel and\nglobal-local) to aid image reconstruction. It bridges the gap within and\nbetween paradigms, aligning and coordinating them to enable deep interaction\nand fusion of features. Specifically, we use two types of self-attention in the\nTransformer blocks: sparse prompt channel self-attention (SPC-SA) and spatial\npixel refinement self-attention (SPR-SA). SPC-SA enhances global channel\ndependencies through dynamic sparsity, while SPR-SA focuses on spatial rain\ndistribution and fine-grained texture recovery. To address the feature\nmisalignment and knowledge differences between them, we introduce the Adaptive\nAlignment Frequency Module (AAFM), which aligns and interacts with features in\na two-stage progressive manner, enabling adaptive guidance and complementarity.\nThis reduces the information gap within and between paradigms.

These codes\nefficiently simulate the progression of SAs, while they still have inherent\nlimitations due to their inconsistent finite difference schemes. The use of\nempirical schemes incorporating both implicit and explicit formulations\ninherently induces unidirectional coupling in multi-physics analyses. The\nobjective of this study is to develop a novel numerical method for TH system\ncodes using physics-informed neural network (PINN).

We propose a node-assigned PINN (NA-PINN) that is suitable for\nthe control volume approach-based system codes. NA-PINN addresses the issue of\nspatial governing equation variation by assigning an individual network to each\nnodalization of the system code, such that spatial information is excluded from\nboth the input and output domains, and each subnetwork learns to approximate a\npurely temporal solution. In this phase, we evaluated the accuracy of the PINN\nmethods for the hydrodynamic module.

To tackle this challenge, this paper introduces an\nISTD framework enhanced by domain adaptation. To alleviate distribution shift\nbetween datasets and achieve cross-sample alignment, we introduce Cross-view\nChannel Alignment (CCA).

The flexibility in its adoption is also demonstrated through its\ninstantiation on an already existing framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eAI\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u672a\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u51b3\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eAI\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3001\u4fe1\u4efb\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b89\u5168\u51b3\u7b56\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u54f2\u5b66\u3001\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u5de5\u7a0b\u7b49\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u6e90\u3001\u4ea4\u901a\u548c\u822a\u7a7a\u7b49\u4e13\u4e1a\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u5b89\u5168\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

International Organization\nfor Standardization (ISO) AI standards, such as ISO/IEC 24027 and 24368, aim to\nfoster responsible development by embedding fairness, transparency, and risk\nmanagement into AI systems. However, their effectiveness varies across diverse\nregulatory landscapes, from the EU's risk-based AI Act to China's\nstability-focused measures and the U.S.'s fragmented state-led initiatives.\nThis paper introduces a novel Comparative Risk-Impact Assessment Framework to\nevaluate how well ISO standards address ethical risks within these contexts,\nproposing enhancements to strengthen their global applicability. By mapping ISO\nstandards to the EU AI Act and surveying regulatory frameworks in ten\nregions-including the UK, Canada, India, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and\nBrazil-we establish a baseline for ethical alignment. The framework, applied to\ncase studies in the EU, US-Colorado, and China, reveals gaps: voluntary ISO\nstandards falter in enforcement (e.g., Colorado) and undervalue region-specific\nrisks like privacy (China).

This paper introduces SAGAI: Streetscape Analysis with Generative\nArtificial Intelligence, a modular workflow for scoring street-level urban\nscenes using open-access data and vision-language models. SAGAI integrates\nOpenStreetMap geometries, Google Street View imagery, and a lightweight version\nof the LLaVA model to generate structured spatial indicators from images via\ncustomizable natural language prompts. The pipeline includes an automated\nmapping module that aggregates visual scores at both the point and street\nlevels, enabling direct cartographic interpretation. It operates without\ntask-specific training or proprietary software dependencies, supporting\nscalable and interpretable analysis of urban environments.

Self-supervised representation learning methods\nsuch as SimCLR (Chen et al., 2020) or BYOL (Grill et al., 2020) have been very\nsuccessful at learning meaningful latent representations from unlabeled image\ndata, resulting in much more general and transferable representations for\ndownstream tasks. Broadly, self-supervised methods fall into two types: 1)\nContrastive methods, such as SimCLR; and 2) Non-Contrastive methods, such as\nBYOL. Contrastive methods are generally trying to maximize mutual information\nbetween related data points, so they need to compare every data point to every\nother data point, resulting in high variance, and thus requiring large batch\nsizes to work well. Non-contrastive methods like BYOL have much lower variance\nas they do not need to make pairwise comparisons, but are much trickier to\nimplement as they have the possibility of collapsing to a constant vector. In\nthis paper, we aim to develop a self-supervised objective that combines the\nstrength of both types. We start with a particular contrastive method called\nthe Spectral Contrastive Loss (HaoChen et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2024), and we\nconvert it into a more general non-contrastive form; this removes the pairwise\ncomparisons resulting in lower variance, but keeps the mutual information\nformulation of the contrastive method preventing collapse.

Specifically, our approach\nemploys self-supervised vision-only backbones to extract object-aware features,\nand it eliminates the need for annotated data throughout the entire proposed\npipeline.

We evaluate our approach on the FSC-147\nbenchmark, where we outperform a baseline under the same label-free setting.\nOur method also achieves competitive -- and in some cases superior -- results\ncompared to training-free approaches relying on supervised backbones, as well\nas several fully supervised state-of-the-art methods.

Methods: Inspired by the EndoViT study, we adapt the Masked\nAutoencoder for federated learning, enhancing it with adaptive Sharpness-Aware\nMinimization (FedSAM) and Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA). Our model is\npretrained on the Endo700k dataset collection and later fine-tuned and\nevaluated for tasks such as Semantic Segmentation, Action Triplet Recognition,\nand Surgical Phase Recognition. Results: Our findings demonstrate that\nintegrating adaptive FedSAM into the federated MAE approach improves\npretraining, leading to a reduction in reconstruction loss per patch. The\napplication of FL-EndoViT in surgical downstream tasks results in performance\ncomparable to CEN-EndoViT. Furthermore, FL-EndoViT exhibits advantages over\nCEN-EndoViT in surgical scene segmentation when data is limited and in action\ntriplet recognition when large datasets are used. Conclusion: These findings\nhighlight the potential of federated learning for privacy-preserving training\nof surgical foundation models, offering a robust and generalizable solution for\nsurgical data science.

In contrast, the second stage applies\nfeature-based anomaly detection using a Diffusion Convolution Recurrent Neural\nNetwork (DCRNN). To ensure Quality of Service (QoS) and maintain Service Level\nAgreements (SLA), trust-aware service migration is performed using Heap-Based\nOptimization (HBO). Additionally, on-demand virtual High-Interaction honeypots\ndeceive attackers and extract attack patterns, which are securely stored using\nthe Bimodal Lattice Signature Scheme (BLISS) to enhance signature-based\nIntrusion Detection Systems (IDS).

In order to separate these similar information and\ntheir respective advantages, reduce the feature redundancy in the fusion stage.\nThis paper introduces a diff-attention aware state space fusion model\n(DAS2F-Model) for multimodal remote sensing image classification. Based on the\nselective state space model, a cross-modal diff-attention module (CMDA-Module)\nis designed to extract and separate the common features and their respective\ndominant features of MS and PAN images.

Considering that features in the\nfusion stage will have large semantic differences after feature separation and\nsimple fusion operations struggle to effectively integrate these significantly\ndifferent features, an attention-aware linear fusion module (AALF-Module) is\nproposed. It performs pixel-wise linear fusion by calculating influence\ncoefficients. This mechanism can fuse features with large semantic differences\nwhile keeping the feature size unchanged.

However, SAM's performance decreases substantially when applied\nto non-natural domains like microscopic imaging. Furthermore, due to SAM's\ninteractive design, it requires a precise prompt for each image and object,\nwhich is unfeasible in many automated biomedical applications. Previous\nsolutions adapt SAM by training millions of parameters via fine-tuning large\nparts of the model or of adapter layers. In contrast, we show that as little as\n2,048 additional parameters are sufficient for turning SAM into a use-case\nspecialist for a certain downstream task. Our novel PTSAM (prompt-tuned SAM)\nmethod uses prompt-tuning, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique, to\nadapt SAM for a specific task. We validate the performance of our approach on\nmultiple microscopic and one medical dataset.

To improve compositional understanding, we first leverage\nthe in-context learning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct\nabout 2M high-quality negative captions across five types. Subsequently, we\npropose the Image-Grounded Contrast (IGC) loss and Text-Grounded Contrast (TGC)\nloss to enhance vision-language compositionally. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the DeGLA framework. Compared to previous\nstate-of-the-art methods, DeGLA achieves an average enhancement of 3.5% across\nthe VALSE, SugarCrepe, and ARO benchmarks. Concurrently, it obtains an average\nperformance improvement of 13.0% on zero-shot classification tasks across\neleven datasets.

However, the adversarial vulnerabilities of these models remain\nrarely explored. We observe that in T2V generation tasks, the generated videos\noften contain substantial redundant information not explicitly specified in the\ntext prompts, such as environmental elements, secondary objects, and additional\ndetails, providing opportunities for malicious attackers to embed hidden\nharmful content. Exploiting this inherent redundancy, we introduce BadVideo,\nthe first backdoor attack framework tailored for T2V generation. Our attack\nfocuses on designing target adversarial outputs through two key strategies: (1)\nSpatio-Temporal Composition, which combines different spatiotemporal features\nto encode malicious information; (2) Dynamic Element Transformation, which\nintroduces transformations in redundant elements over time to convey malicious\ninformation. Based on these strategies, the attacker's malicious target\nseamlessly integrates with the user's textual instructions, providing high\nstealthiness. Moreover, by exploiting the temporal dimension of videos, our\nattack successfully evades traditional content moderation systems that\nprimarily analyze spatial information within individual frames. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that BadVideo achieves high attack success rates while\npreserving original semantics and maintaining excellent performance on clean\ninputs.

This is largely due to the level of complexity in attention\ninfrastructure, and the rapid evolution of AI hardware architecture. At the\nsame time, many state-of-the-art foundational models, particularly in computer\nvision, are heavily bound by attention, and need reliable sparsity to escape\nthe O(n^2) complexity. In this paper, we study a class of promising sparse\nattention mechanisms that focus on locality, and aim to develop a better\nanalytical model of their performance improvements. We first introduce\nGeneralized Neighborhood Attention (GNA), which can describe sliding window,\nstrided sliding window, and blocked attention. We then consider possible design\nchoices in implementing these approaches, and create a simulator that can\nprovide much more realistic speedup upper bounds for any given setting.\nFinally, we implement GNA on top of a state-of-the-art fused multi-headed\nattention (FMHA) kernel designed for the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture in\nCUTLASS. Our implementation can fully realize the maximum speedup theoretically\npossible in many perfectly block-sparse cases, and achieves an effective\nutilization of 1.3 petaFLOPs/second in FP16. In addition, we plug various GNA\nconfigurations into off-the-shelf generative models, such as Cosmos-7B,\nHunyuanVideo, and FLUX, and show that it can deliver 28% to 46% end-to-end\nspeedup on B200 without any fine-tuning.

Extensive studies on various models of\nFederated learning have been done since the coinage of its term. One of the\nimportant derivatives of federated learning is hierarchical semi-decentralized\nfederated learning, which distributes the load of the aggregation task over\nmultiple nodes and parallelizes the aggregation workload at the breadth of each\nlevel of the hierarchy. Various methods have also been proposed to perform\ninter-cluster and intra-cluster aggregation optimally. Most of the solutions,\nnonetheless, require monitoring the nodes' performance and resource consumption\nat each round, which necessitates frequently exchanging systematic data. To\noptimally perform distributed aggregation in SDFL with minimal reliance on\nsystematic data, we propose Flag-Swap, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)\nmethod that optimizes the aggregation placement according only to the\nprocessing delay. Our simulation results show that PSO-based placement can find\nthe optimal placement relatively fast, even in scenarios with many clients as\ncandidates for aggregation. Our real-world docker-based implementation of\nFlag-Swap over the recently emerged FL framework shows superior performance\ncompared to black-box-based deterministic placement strategies, with about 43%\nminutes faster than random placement, and 32% minutes faster than uniform\nplacement, in terms of total processing time.", "AI": {"tldr": "Flag-Swap\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\uff08PSO\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5206\u5c42\u534a\u5206\u6563\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08SDFL\uff09\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u805a\u5408\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5904\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u548c\u5747\u5300\u653e\u7f6e\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u9891\u7e41\u4ea4\u6362\u7cfb\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u76d1\u63a7\u8282\u70b9\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800cFlag-Swap\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5904\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u805a\u5408\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFlag-Swap\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8ePSO\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728SDFL\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u805a\u5408\u8282\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u9645Docker\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u793a\uff0cFlag-Swap\u6bd4\u968f\u673a\u653e\u7f6e\u5feb43%\uff0c\u6bd4\u5747\u5300\u653e\u7f6e\u5feb32%\u3002", "conclusion": "Flag-Swap\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u7cfb\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u805a\u5408\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Recent methods, like\nRoboDreamer, utilize linguistic decomposition to divide instructions into\nseparate lower-level primitives, conditioning the world model on these\nprimitives to achieve compositional instruction-following. However, these\nseparate primitives do not consider the relationships that exist between them.\nFurthermore, recent methods neglect valuable visual guidance, including depth\nand semantic guidance, both crucial for enhancing visual quality. This paper\nintroduces ManipDreamer, an advanced world model based on the action tree and\nvisual guidance. To better learn the relationships between instruction\nprimitives, we represent the instruction as the action tree and assign\nembeddings to tree nodes, each instruction can acquire its embeddings by\nnavigating through the action tree. The instruction embeddings can be used to\nguide the world model. To enhance visual quality, we combine depth and semantic\nguidance by introducing a visual guidance adapter compatible with the world\nmodel. This visual adapter enhances both the temporal and physical consistency\nof video generation. Based on the action tree and visual guidance, ManipDreamer\nsignificantly boosts the instruction-following ability and visual quality.\nComprehensive evaluations on robotic manipulation benchmarks reveal that\nManipDreamer achieves large improvements in video quality metrics in both seen\nand unseen tasks, with PSNR improved from 19.55 to 21.05, SSIM improved from\n0.7474 to 0.7982 and reduced Flow Error from 3.506 to 3.201 in unseen tasks,\ncompared to the recent RoboDreamer model.

However, a significant gap remains between their current\nperformance and that of expert software engineers.

We present ClarifyCoder, a novel framework with\nsynthetic data generation and instruction-tuning that enables LLMs to identify\nambiguities and request clarification before proceeding with code generation.\nWhile recent work has focused on LLM-based agents for iterative code\ngeneration, we argue that the fundamental ability to recognize and query\nambiguous requirements should be intrinsic to the models themselves.

Recently, they have\nbeen shown to succumb to adversarial input attacks which make small\nimperceptible changes to the input image yet the hashing algorithm does not\ndetect its similarity to the original image. Property-preserving hashing (PPH)\nis a recent construct in cryptography, which preserves some property\n(predicate) of its inputs in the hash domain. Researchers have so far shown\nconstructions of PPH for Hamming distance predicates, which, for instance,\noutputs 1 if two inputs are within Hamming distance $t$. A key feature of PPH\nis its strong correctness guarantee, i.e., the probability that the predicate\nwill not be correctly evaluated in the hash domain is negligible. Motivated by\nthe use case of detecting similar images under adversarial setting, we propose\nthe first PPH construction for an $\\ell_1$-distance predicate. Roughly, this\npredicate checks if the two one-sided $\\ell_1$-distances between two images are\nwithin a threshold $t$. Since many adversarial attacks use $\\ell_2$-distance\n(related to $\\ell_1$-distance) as the objective function to perturb the input\nimage, by appropriately choosing the threshold $t$, we can force the attacker\nto add considerable noise to evade detection, and hence significantly\ndeteriorate the image quality. Our proposed scheme is highly efficient, and\nruns in time $O(t^2)$. For grayscale images of size $28 \\times 28$, we can\nevaluate the predicate in $0.0784$ seconds when pixel values are perturbed by\nup to $1 \\%$.

Previous works usually suffer\nfrom data sparsity and cold-start problems, and may fail to adequately explore\nsemantic user-product associations from multimodal data. To address these\nissues, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Hypergraph Contrastive Learning (MMHCL)\nframework for user recommendation. For a comprehensive information exploration\nfrom user-product relations, we construct two hypergraphs, i.e. a user-to-user\n(u2u) hypergraph and an item-to-item (i2i) hypergraph, to mine shared\npreferences among users and intricate multimodal semantic resemblance among\nitems, respectively. This process yields denser second-order semantics that are\nfused with first-order user-item interaction as complementary to alleviate the\ndata sparsity issue. Then, we design a contrastive feature enhancement paradigm\nby applying synergistic contrastive learning. By maximizing/minimizing the\nmutual information between second-order (e.g. shared preference pattern for\nusers) and first-order (information of selected items for users) embeddings of\nthe same/different users and items, the feature distinguishability can be\neffectively enhanced. Compared with using sparse primary user-item interaction\nonly, our MMHCL obtains denser second-order hypergraphs and excavates more\nabundant shared attributes to explore the user-product associations, which to a\ncertain extent alleviates the problems of data sparsity and cold-start.\nExtensive experiments have comprehensively demonstrated the effectiveness of\nour method.

However, their reliance on cloud infrastructure\nand substantial computational requirements pose challenges for analyzing\nsensitive or proprietary codebases due to privacy concerns and inference costs.\nThis work explores the potential of Small Language Models (SLMs) as a viable\nalternative for accurate, on-premise vulnerability detection. We investigated\nwhether a 350-million parameter pre-trained code model (codegen-mono) could be\neffectively fine-tuned to detect the MITRE Top 25 CWEs specifically within\nPython code. To facilitate this, we developed a targeted dataset of 500\nexamples using a semi-supervised approach involving LLM-driven synthetic data\ngeneration coupled with meticulous human review. Initial tests confirmed that\nthe base codegen-mono model completely failed to identify CWEs in our samples.\nHowever, after applying instruction-following fine-tuning, the specialized SLM\nachieved remarkable performance on our test set, yielding approximately 99%\naccuracy, 98.08% precision, 100% recall, and a 99.04% F1-score.

Despite\ngenerative model's promise, inconsistencies in prior research and a lack of\nrigorous evaluation have hindered a comprehensive understanding of their true\npotential. In this paper, we introduce MAYA, a unified, customizable,\nplug-and-play password benchmarking framework. MAYA provides a standardized\napproach for evaluating generative password-guessing models through a rigorous\nset of advanced testing scenarios and a collection of eight real-life password\ndatasets. Using MAYA, we comprehensively evaluate six state-of-the-art\napproaches, which have been re-implemented and adapted to ensure\nstandardization, for a total of over 15,000 hours of computation. Our findings\nindicate that these models effectively capture different aspects of human\npassword distribution and exhibit strong generalization capabilities. However,\ntheir effectiveness varies significantly with long and complex passwords.\nThrough our evaluation, sequential models consistently outperform other\ngenerative architectures and traditional password-guessing tools, demonstrating\nunique capabilities in generating accurate and complex guesses.

For instance, if a jobs program benefits members\nof one city more than another, is that due to differences in program\nparticipants (particular covariates) or the local labor markets (outcomes given\ncovariates)? The Kitagawa-Oaxaca-Blinder (KOB) decomposition is a standard tool\nin econometrics that explains the difference in the mean outcome across two\npopulations. However, the KOB decomposition assumes a linear relationship\nbetween covariates and outcomes, while the true relationship may be\nmeaningfully nonlinear. Modern machine learning boasts a variety of nonlinear\nfunctional decompositions for the relationship between outcomes and covariates\nin one population. It seems natural to extend the KOB decomposition using these\nfunctional decompositions. We observe that a successful extension should not\nattribute the differences to covariates -- or, respectively, to outcomes given\ncovariates -- if those are the same in the two populations. Unfortunately, we\ndemonstrate that, even in simple examples, two common decompositions --\nfunctional ANOVA and Accumulated Local Effects -- can attribute differences to\noutcomes given covariates, even when they are identical in two populations. We\nprovide a characterization of when functional ANOVA misattributes, as well as a\ngeneral property that any discrete decomposition must satisfy to avoid\nmisattribution. We show that if the decomposition is independent of its input\ndistribution, it does not misattribute.

While dynamics models used in\nmodel-based control can be learned from real-world data, they often struggle to\ngeneralize to unseen terrain, making real-time adaptation essential. We propose\na novel framework that combines a Kalman filter-based online adaptation scheme\nwith meta-learned parameters to address these challenges. Offline meta-learning\noptimizes the basis functions along which adaptation occurs, as well as the\nadaptation parameters, while online adaptation dynamically adjusts the onboard\ndynamics model in real time for model-based control. We validate our approach\nthrough extensive experiments, including real-world testing on a full-scale\nautonomous off-road vehicle, demonstrating that our method outperforms baseline\napproaches in prediction accuracy, performance, and safety metrics,\nparticularly in safety-critical scenarios. Our results underscore the\neffectiveness of meta-learned dynamics model adaptation, advancing the\ndevelopment of reliable autonomous systems capable of navigating diverse and\nunseen environments.

However, these methods often rely on learning from large\namount of expert demonstrations. To address these shortcomings, we propose\nLatent Diffusion Planning (LDP), a modular approach consisting of a planner\nwhich can leverage action-free demonstrations, and an inverse dynamics model\nwhich can leverage suboptimal data, that both operate over a learned latent\nspace. First, we learn a compact latent space through a variational\nautoencoder, enabling effective forecasting of future states in image-based\ndomains. Then, we train a planner and an inverse dynamics model with diffusion\nobjectives. By separating planning from action prediction, LDP can benefit from\nthe denser supervision signals of suboptimal and action-free data. On simulated\nvisual robotic manipulation tasks, LDP outperforms state-of-the-art imitation\nlearning approaches, as they cannot leverage such additional data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLatent Diffusion Planning (LDP)\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u52a8\u4f5c\u6f14\u793a\u548c\u6b21\u4f18\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u89c6\u89c9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002LDP\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6b21\u4f18\u548c\u65e0\u52a8\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "LDP\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9006\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7d27\u51d1\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u76ee\u6807\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u548c\u9006\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u89c6\u89c9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cLDP\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "LDP\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u6b21\u4f18\u548c\u65e0\u52a8\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
