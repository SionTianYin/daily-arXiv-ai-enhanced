### [1] [Semi-automated Fact-checking in Portuguese: Corpora Enrichment using Retrieval with Claim extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06495)
*Juliana Resplande Sant'anna Gomes,Arlindo Rodrigues Galvão Filho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种半自动事实核查（SAFC）系统，通过结合外部证据增强葡萄牙语新闻语料库，填补了现有数据集的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于虚假信息传播速度快于人工核查能力，且葡萄牙语缺乏整合外部证据的公开数据集，亟需开发SAFC系统。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）提取文本主要主张，并通过搜索引擎API检索外部证据，同时引入数据验证和预处理框架。

Result: 成功开发并应用了方法，丰富了葡萄牙语新闻语料库（Fake.Br, COVID19.BR, MuMiN-PT）。

Conclusion: 该方法为葡萄牙语SAFC系统提供了更全面的数据集，支持更强大的事实核查能力。

Abstract: The accelerated dissemination of disinformation often outpaces the capacity
for manual fact-checking, highlighting the urgent need for Semi-Automated
Fact-Checking (SAFC) systems. Within the Portuguese language context, there is
a noted scarcity of publicly available datasets that integrate external
evidence, an essential component for developing robust AFC systems, as many
existing resources focus solely on classification based on intrinsic text
features. This dissertation addresses this gap by developing, applying, and
analyzing a methodology to enrich Portuguese news corpora (Fake.Br, COVID19.BR,
MuMiN-PT) with external evidence. The approach simulates a user's verification
process, employing Large Language Models (LLMs, specifically Gemini 1.5 Flash)
to extract the main claim from texts and search engine APIs (Google Search API,
Google FactCheck Claims Search API) to retrieve relevant external documents
(evidence). Additionally, a data validation and preprocessing framework,
including near-duplicate detection, is introduced to enhance the quality of the
base corpora.

### [2] [Retrieval augmented generation based dynamic prompting for few-shot biomedical named entity recognition using large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06504)
*Yao Ge,Sudeshna Das,Yuting Guo,Abeed Sarker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了动态提示策略在少样本生物医学命名实体识别（NER）中的应用，通过检索增强生成（RAG）优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在少样本生物医学NER中的性能挑战。

Method: 采用动态提示策略，基于输入文本的相似性选择上下文学习示例，并在推理过程中动态更新提示。

Result: 动态提示显著提升了性能，TF-IDF和SBERT检索方法在5-shot和10-shot设置中分别提高了平均F1分数7.3%和5.6%。

Conclusion: 上下文自适应提示通过RAG在生物医学NER中具有显著效用。

Abstract: Biomedical named entity recognition (NER) is a high-utility natural language
processing (NLP) task, and large language models (LLMs) show promise
particularly in few-shot settings (i.e., limited training data). In this
article, we address the performance challenges of LLMs for few-shot biomedical
NER by investigating a dynamic prompting strategy involving retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG). In our approach, the annotated in-context learning examples
are selected based on their similarities with the input texts, and the prompt
is dynamically updated for each instance during inference. We implemented and
optimized static and dynamic prompt engineering techniques and evaluated them
on five biomedical NER datasets. Static prompting with structured components
increased average F1-scores by 12% for GPT-4, and 11% for GPT-3.5 and LLaMA
3-70B, relative to basic static prompting. Dynamic prompting further improved
performance, with TF-IDF and SBERT retrieval methods yielding the best results,
improving average F1-scores by 7.3% and 5.6% in 5-shot and 10-shot settings,
respectively. These findings highlight the utility of contextually adaptive
prompts via RAG for biomedical NER.

### [3] [CarbonScaling: Extending Neural Scaling Laws for Carbon Footprint in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06524)
*Lei Jiang,Fan Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了CarbonScaling框架，将神经扩展定律与碳排放结合，分析LLM训练中的碳足迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经扩展定律忽略了LLM规模增长带来的碳排放问题，需要一种方法将模型精度与碳足迹联系起来。

Method: 通过整合神经扩展模型、GPU硬件演进、并行优化和碳排放估算，构建CarbonScaling框架。

Result: 结果显示精度与碳排放存在幂律关系，但实际效率问题增加了扩展因子；硬件技术进步对中小型模型有效，但对超大型LLM效果有限。

Conclusion: CarbonScaling为训练更可持续和高效的LLM提供了关键见解，优化如批量大小调整可缓解效率问题。

Abstract: Neural scaling laws have driven the development of increasingly large
language models (LLMs) by linking accuracy improvements to growth in parameter
count, dataset size, and compute. However, these laws overlook the carbon
emissions that scale exponentially with LLM size. This paper presents
\textit{CarbonScaling}, an analytical framework that extends neural scaling
laws to incorporate both operational and embodied carbon in LLM training. By
integrating models for neural scaling, GPU hardware evolution, parallelism
optimization, and carbon estimation, \textit{CarbonScaling} quantitatively
connects model accuracy to carbon footprint. Results show that while a
power-law relationship between accuracy and carbon holds, real-world
inefficiencies significantly increase the scaling factor. Hardware technology
scaling reduces carbon emissions for small to mid-sized models, but offers
diminishing returns for extremely large LLMs due to communication overhead and
underutilized GPUs. Training optimizations-especially aggressive critical batch
size scaling-help alleviate this inefficiency. \textit{CarbonScaling} offers
key insights for training more sustainable and carbon-efficient LLMs.

### [4] [The Art of Breaking Words: Rethinking Multilingual Tokenizer Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06533)
*Aamod Thakur,Ajay Nagpal,Atharva Savarkar,Kundeshwar Pundalik,Siddhesh Dosi,Piyush Sawarkar,Viraj Thakur,Rohit Saluja,Maunendra Sankar Desarkar,Ganesh Ramakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了多语言环境下LLM的tokenization问题，提出了一种新的数据组合算法，显著提高了token-to-word效率，并在模型性能和推理速度上取得了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有tokenizer在多语言环境中效率低下，尤其是在高多样性和复杂性的Indic脚本中表现不佳，亟需改进。

Method: 通过系统研究词汇量、预tokenization规则和训练语料组成，提出了一种新的数据组合算法，并在Indic脚本上进行了广泛实验。

Result: 新算法将平均token-to-word比率降低了约6%，并在多语言Indic模型中实现了40%以上的改进，显著提升了模型性能和推理速度。

Conclusion: tokenization是构建高效、可扩展多语言LLM的关键因素，应与模型架构和训练目标同等重视。

Abstract: While model architecture and training objectives are well-studied,
tokenization, particularly in multilingual contexts, remains a relatively
neglected aspect of Large Language Model (LLM) development. Existing tokenizers
often exhibit high token-to-word ratios, inefficient use of context length, and
slower inference. We present a systematic study that links vocabulary size,
pre-tokenization rules, and training-corpus composition to both token-to-word
efficiency and model quality. To ground our analysis in a linguistically
diverse context, we conduct extensive experiments on Indic scripts, which
present unique challenges due to their high script diversity and orthographic
complexity. Drawing on the insights from these analyses, we propose a novel
algorithm for data composition that balances multilingual data for tokenizer
training. Our observations on pretokenization strategies significantly improve
model performance, and our data composition algorithm reduces the average
token-to-word ratio by approximately 6% with respect to the conventional data
randomization approach. Our tokenizer achieves more than 40% improvement on
average token-to-word ratio against stateof-the-art multilingual Indic models.
This improvement yields measurable gains in both model performance and
inference speed. This highlights tokenization alongside architecture and
training objectives as a critical lever for building efficient, scalable
multilingual LLMs

### [5] [Factor Augmented Supervised Learning with Text Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06548)
*Zhanye Luo,Yuefeng Han,Xiufan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AEALT是一种监督学习的降维框架，通过增强自编码器从LLM生成的文本嵌入中提取低维任务相关特征，显著提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维文本嵌入在计算效率和成本上存在问题，需要一种方法直接在学习过程中降维。

Method: 提取文本嵌入后，通过监督增强自编码器学习低维任务相关潜在因子。

Result: 在分类、异常检测和预测任务中，AEALT优于传统深度学习和标准降维方法。

Conclusion: AEALT通过结合降维与LLM工作流，显著提升了嵌入的效率和任务性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate text embeddings from text data,
producing vector representations that capture the semantic meaning and
contextual relationships of words. However, the high dimensionality of these
embeddings often impedes efficiency and drives up computational cost in
downstream tasks. To address this, we propose AutoEncoder-Augmented Learning
with Text (AEALT), a supervised, factor-augmented framework that incorporates
dimension reduction directly into pre-trained LLM workflows. First, we extract
embeddings from text documents; next, we pass them through a supervised
augmented autoencoder to learn low-dimensional, task-relevant latent factors.
By modeling the nonlinear structure of complex embeddings, AEALT outperforms
conventional deep-learning approaches that rely on raw embeddings. We validate
its broad applicability with extensive experiments on classification, anomaly
detection, and prediction tasks using multiple real-world public datasets.
Numerical results demonstrate that AEALT yields substantial gains over both
vanilla embeddings and several standard dimension reduction methods.

### [6] [Discerning minds or generic tutors? Evaluating instructional guidance capabilities in Socratic LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06583)
*Ying Liu,Can Li,Ting Zhang,Mei Wang,Qiannan Zhu,Jian Li,Hua Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在动态调整教学策略以适应用户认知状态方面的能力，提出了GuideEval基准，并发现现有LLMs在适应性教学方面存在不足，但通过行为引导的微调策略可以显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLMs的苏格拉底式提问能力，而忽略了其根据学习者认知状态动态调整教学策略的潜力，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出GuideEval基准，基于真实教育对话，通过三个阶段（感知、编排、激发）评估LLMs的教学指导能力，并引入行为引导的微调策略。

Result: 现有LLMs在适应性教学方面表现不佳，但行为引导的微调策略显著提升了其指导性能。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁从孤立内容评估转向以学习者为中心的交互范式，为评估苏格拉底式LLMs提供了新的视角。

Abstract: The conversational capabilities of large language models hold significant
promise for enabling scalable and interactive tutoring. While prior research
has primarily examined their capacity for Socratic questioning, it often
overlooks a critical dimension: adaptively guiding learners based on their
cognitive states. This study shifts focus from mere question generation to the
broader instructional guidance capability. We ask: Can LLMs emulate expert
tutors who dynamically adjust strategies in response to learners'
understanding? To investigate this, we propose GuideEval, a benchmark grounded
in authentic educational dialogues that evaluates pedagogical guidance through
a three-phase behavioral framework: (1) Perception, inferring learner states;
(2) Orchestration, adapting instructional strategies; and (3) Elicitation,
stimulating proper reflections. Empirical findings reveal that existing LLMs
frequently fail to provide effective adaptive scaffolding when learners exhibit
confusion or require redirection. Furthermore, we introduce a behavior-guided
finetuning strategy that leverages behavior-prompted instructional dialogues,
significantly enhancing guidance performance. By shifting the focus from
isolated content evaluation to learner-centered interaction, our work advocates
a more dialogic paradigm for evaluating Socratic LLMs.

### [7] [LLM Unlearning Without an Expert Curated Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06595)
*Xiaoyuan Zhu,Muru Zhang,Ollie Liu,Robin Jia,Willie Neiswanger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动化生成高质量遗忘数据集的方法，用于语言模型的特定领域知识遗忘，无需人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大型语言模型可能包含敏感、有害或受版权保护的知识，需要一种无需完全重新训练即可遗忘特定领域知识的方法。

Method: 通过结构化提示管道自动生成教科书风格的数据集，仅需输入领域名称。

Result: 实验表明，生成的合成数据集在遗忘生物安全、网络安全和哈利波特小说等领域知识时优于基线方法，并与专家策划的数据集相当。

Conclusion: 合成数据集为广泛领域的实用、可扩展遗忘提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: Modern large language models often encode sensitive, harmful, or copyrighted
knowledge, raising the need for post-hoc unlearning-the ability to remove
specific domains of knowledge from a model without full retraining. A major
bottleneck in current unlearning pipelines is constructing effective forget
sets-datasets that approximate the target domain and guide the model to forget
it. In this work, we introduce a scalable, automated approach to generate
high-quality forget sets using language models themselves. Our method
synthesizes textbook-style data through a structured prompting pipeline,
requiring only a domain name as input. Through experiments on unlearning
biosecurity, cybersecurity, and Harry Potter novels, we show that our synthetic
datasets consistently outperform the baseline synthetic alternatives and are
comparable to the expert-curated ones. Additionally, ablation studies reveal
that the multi-step generation pipeline significantly boosts data diversity,
which in turn improves unlearning utility. Overall, our findings suggest that
synthetic datasets offer a promising path toward practical, scalable unlearning
for a wide range of emerging domains without the need for manual intervention.

### [8] [BrowseComp-Plus: A More Fair and Transparent Evaluation Benchmark of Deep-Research Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06600)
*Zijian Chen,Xueguang Ma,Shengyao Zhuang,Ping Nie,Kai Zou,Andrew Liu,Joshua Green,Kshama Patel,Ruoxi Meng,Mingyi Su,Sahel Sharifymoghaddam,Yanxi Li,Haoran Hong,Xinyu Shi,Xuye Liu,Nandan Thakur,Crystina Zhang,Luyu Gao,Wenhu Chen,Jimmy Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了BrowseComp-Plus基准，解决了现有评估方法在公平性和透明度上的不足，通过固定语料库实现可控实验，显著区分了不同深度研究系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法（如BrowseComp）依赖动态且不透明的网络搜索API，导致公平性和透明度问题，无法有效评估深度研究LLM的能力。

Method: 基于BrowseComp构建BrowseComp-Plus基准，使用固定且精选的语料库，包含人工验证的支持文档和挑战性负样本。

Result: BrowseComp-Plus能有效区分系统性能，例如GPT-5的准确率从55.9%提升至70.1%（结合Qwen3-Embedding-8B检索器）。

Conclusion: BrowseComp-Plus为深度研究系统和检索方法提供了全面评估框架，有助于分析检索效果、引用准确性和上下文工程。

Abstract: Deep-Research agents, which integrate large language models (LLMs) with
search tools, have shown success in improving the effectiveness of handling
complex queries that require iterative search planning and reasoning over
search results. Evaluations on current benchmarks like BrowseComp relies on
black-box live web search APIs, have notable limitations in (1) fairness:
dynamic and opaque web APIs hinder fair comparisons and reproducibility of deep
research methods; (2) transparency: lack of control over the document corpus
makes it difficult to isolate retriever contributions. In other words, the
current evaluations may compare a complete deep research system at a given
time, but they do not foster well-controlled experiments to provide insights
into the capability of underlying deep research LLMs. To address these
challenges, we introduce BrowseComp-Plus, a benchmark derived from BrowseComp,
employing a fixed, carefully curated corpus. Each query in BrowseComp-Plus
includes human-verified supporting documents and mined challenging negatives,
enabling controlled experimentation. The benchmark is shown to be effective in
distinguishing the performance of deep research systems. For instance, the
open-source model Search-R1, when paired with the BM25 retriever, achieves
3.86% accuracy, whereas the GPT-5 achieves 55.9%. Integrating the GPT-5 with
the Qwen3-Embedding-8B retriever further enhances its accuracy to 70.1% with
fewer search calls. This benchmark allows comprehensive evaluation and
disentangled analysis of deep research agents and retrieval methods, fostering
insights into retrieval effectiveness, citation accuracy, and context
engineering in Deep-Research system.

### [9] [Train It and Forget It: Merge Lists are Unnecessary for BPE Inference in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06621)
*Tomohiro Sawada,Kartik Goyal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了不依赖合并列表的BPE推断算法对语言模型性能的影响，发现非目标性算法对性能影响较小，为更简单且隐私保护的标记化方案提供了可能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BPE标记化中的合并列表可能成为攻击面，泄露训练数据信息，因此研究不依赖合并列表的推断算法的下游影响。

Method: 研究两类BPE推断方案：a) 目标性偏离合并列表（如随机合并顺序或删除/截断合并列表）；b) 非目标性算法（不依赖合并列表，专注于贪婪或精确压缩文本）。

Result: 目标性偏离导致性能显著下降，而非目标性算法对性能影响极小，甚至远低于预期。

Conclusion: 非目标性BPE推断算法为更简单且隐私保护的标记化方案提供了可行性，且不会显著损害模型性能。

Abstract: Standard Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization compresses text by pairing a
learned token vocabulary with a detailed merge list. Recent work has shown that
this merge list exposes a potential attack surface for extracting information
about language model's training data. In this paper, we explore the downstream
impact of BPE inference algorithms that do not rely on this merge list at all,
and hence differ from the encoding process during BPE training. To address this
question, we investigate two broad classes of BPE inference schemes that differ
from BPE application during training: a) targeted deviation from merge-lists
including random merge orders, and various corruptions of merge list involving
deletion/truncation, and b) non-targeted BPE inference algorithms that do not
depend on the merge list but focus on compressing the text either greedily or
exactly. Extensive experiments across diverse language modeling tasks like
accuracy-based QA benchmarks, machine translation, and open-ended generation
reveal that while targeted deviation from the merge lists exhibits significant
degradation in language model performance, the non-targeted merge-list-free
inference algorithms result in minimal impact on downstream performance that is
often much smaller than expected. These findings pave way for simpler and
potentially more privacy-preserving tokenization schemes that do not
catastrophically compromise model performance.

### [10] [Measuring Stereotype and Deviation Biases in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06649)
*Daniel Wang,Eli Brignac,Minjia Mao,Xiao Fang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）存在刻板印象偏差和偏离偏差，可能对特定群体造成潜在危害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在生成内容中可能表现出的两种偏差及其潜在风险。

Method: 通过让四种先进LLMs生成个人资料，分析其与政治倾向、宗教和性取向等属性的关联。

Result: 所有测试的LLMs均对多个群体表现出显著的刻板印象偏差和偏离偏差。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在推断用户属性时的偏差问题，警示其生成内容可能带来的危害。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely applied across diverse domains,
raising concerns about their limitations and potential risks. In this study, we
investigate two types of bias that LLMs may display: stereotype bias and
deviation bias. Stereotype bias refers to when LLMs consistently associate
specific traits with a particular demographic group. Deviation bias reflects
the disparity between the demographic distributions extracted from
LLM-generated content and real-world demographic distributions. By asking four
advanced LLMs to generate profiles of individuals, we examine the associations
between each demographic group and attributes such as political affiliation,
religion, and sexual orientation. Our experimental results show that all
examined LLMs exhibit both significant stereotype bias and deviation bias
towards multiple groups. Our findings uncover the biases that occur when LLMs
infer user attributes and shed light on the potential harms of LLM-generated
outputs.

### [11] [Testing the Limits of Machine Translation from One Book](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06665)
*Jonathan Shaw,Dillon Mee,Timothy Khouw,Zackary Leech,Daniel Wilson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何利用语言资源（如语法、词典和平行句子）提升LLM在低资源语言（如Kanuri）翻译中的表现，发现平行句子效果最佳，而单独语法资源效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kanuri语言虽使用者众多但数字资源匮乏，研究旨在探索如何通过不同语言资源提升LLM的翻译质量。

Method: 设计两个数据集（健康和通用术语），比较不同语言资源组合对翻译的影响，并对比人类翻译结果。

Result: 平行句子效果最好，语法资源虽优于零样本翻译但效果有限，LLM在准确性上优于流畅性。

Conclusion: LLM翻译需多维评估，语法资源需结合平行句子才能有效提升翻译质量。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art models demonstrate capacity to leverage in-context
learning to translate into previously unseen language contexts. Tanzer et al.
[2024] utilize language materials (e.g. a grammar) to improve translation
quality for Kalamang using large language models (LLMs). We focus on Kanuri, a
language that, despite having substantial speaker population, has minimal
digital resources. We design two datasets for evaluation: one focused on health
and humanitarian terms, and another containing generalized terminology,
investigating how domain-specific tasks impact LLM translation quality.
  By providing different combinations of language resources (grammar,
dictionary, and parallel sentences), we measure LLM translation effectiveness,
comparing results to native speaker translations and human linguist
performance. We evaluate using both automatic metrics and native speaker
assessments of fluency and accuracy.
  Results demonstrate that parallel sentences remain the most effective data
source, outperforming other methods in human evaluations and automatic metrics.
While incorporating grammar improves over zero-shot translation, it fails as an
effective standalone data source. Human evaluations reveal that LLMs achieve
accuracy (meaning) more effectively than fluency (grammaticality).
  These findings suggest LLM translation evaluation benefits from
multidimensional assessment beyond simple accuracy metrics, and that grammar
alone, without parallel sentences, does not provide sufficient context for
effective domain-specific translation.

*Swati Rajwal,Shivank Garg,Reem Abdel-Salam,Abdelrahman Zayed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，语言模型的偏见行为与其思维步骤的偏见关联性较低，表明模型可能有偏见输出但不一定有偏见思维。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型在思维步骤中是否存在偏见，以理解其偏见行为的根源。

Method: 使用链式思维提示法，对5个流行大语言模型进行实验，量化11种偏见的思维和输出。

Result: 思维步骤的偏见与输出偏见的关联性较低（相关性小于0.6，p值通常小于0.001）。

Conclusion: 模型可能有偏见输出但不一定有偏见思维，这与人类行为不同。

Abstract: The impressive performance of language models is undeniable. However, the
presence of biases based on gender, race, socio-economic status, physical
appearance, and sexual orientation makes the deployment of language models
challenging. This paper studies the effect of chain-of-thought prompting, a
recent approach that studies the steps followed by the model before it
responds, on fairness. More specifically, we ask the following question:
\textit{Do biased models have biased thoughts}? To answer our question, we
conduct experiments on $5$ popular large language models using fairness metrics
to quantify $11$ different biases in the model's thoughts and output. Our
results show that the bias in the thinking steps is not highly correlated with
the output bias (less than $0.6$ correlation with a $p$-value smaller than
$0.001$ in most cases). In other words, unlike human beings, the tested models
with biased decisions do not always possess biased thoughts.

### [13] [Play Favorites: A Statistical Method to Measure Self-Bias in LLM-as-a-Judge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06709)
*Evangelia Spiliopoulou,Riccardo Fogliato,Hanna Burnsky,Tamer Soliman,Jie Ma,Graham Horwood,Miguel Ballesteros*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统计框架，用于识别和量化大型语言模型（LLM）作为评委时的自我偏见（self-bias），并分析了这种偏见对模型性能评估的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为评委时可能对自己的输出评分过高（自我偏见），导致模型性能评估失真。现有研究常混淆模型质量差异与偏见，或错误假设LLM与人类评委的评分分布相同。

Method: 提出统计框架，建模LLM评委对自己和其他模型输出的评分分布差异，同时考虑第三方评委（如人类）对输出质量的独立评估。

Result: 实证分析发现，某些模型（如GPT-4o和Claude 3.5 Sonnet）对自己的输出评分更高，且对同家族模型输出也存在偏见（家族偏见）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了使用LLM评委的潜在问题，并提供了减少偏见、改进自动评估的实用建议。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can serve as judges that offer rapid and
reliable assessments of other LLM outputs. However, models may systematically
assign overly favorable ratings to their own outputs, a phenomenon known as
self-bias, which can distort evaluations of true model performance. Previous
studies often conflate genuine differences in model quality with bias or
incorrectly assume that evaluations from LLMs and humans follow the same rating
distributions. In this work, we present a statistical framework that explicitly
formalizes assumptions under which self-bias can be identified and estimated.
Our method models the difference in the scoring distribution that
LLM-as-a-judge assigns to its own completions compared to other models, while
accounting for the underlying quality of the completions provided by an
independent, third-party judge (e.g., humans). Our method reliably isolates and
quantifies self-bias, even when models vary in ability, ensuring that genuine
performance differences are not mistaken for self-bias. We conduct an empirical
analysis of self-bias on a large dataset (>5000 prompt-completion pairs)
consisting of expert human annotations and judgments from nine different LLM
judges. We find that some models, such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet,
systematically assign higher scores to their own outputs. These models also
display family-bias; systematically assigning higher ratings to outputs
produced by other models of the same family. Our findings highlight potential
pitfalls of using LLM judges and offer practical guidance to mitigate biases
when interpreting automated evaluations.

### [14] [Large Language Models for Oral History Understanding with Text Classification and Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06729)
*Komala Subramanyam Cherukuri,Pranav Abishai Moses,Aisa Sakata,Jiangping Chen,Haihua Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的自动化框架，用于对日裔美国人监禁口述历史进行语义和情感标注，通过多阶段方法结合专家标注和模型评估，展示了LLM在大规模口述历史分析中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 口述历史是记录系统性不公和历史抹除的重要资料，但其非结构化格式、情感复杂性和高标注成本限制了大规模分析。

Method: 使用LLM（如ChatGPT、Llama和Qwen）构建高质量数据集，评估零样本、少样本和RAG策略，结合专家标注和提示设计。

Result: ChatGPT在语义分类中表现最佳（F1得分88.71%），Llama在情感分析中略优（82.66%），最终标注了92,191个句子。

Conclusion: 研究表明，LLM在精心设计的提示下能有效分析大规模口述历史，为数字人文和集体记忆保护提供了可复用的标注流程和伦理指导。

Abstract: Oral histories are vital records of lived experience, particularly within
communities affected by systemic injustice and historical erasure. Effective
and efficient analysis of their oral history archives can promote access and
understanding of the oral histories. However, Large-scale analysis of these
archives remains limited due to their unstructured format, emotional
complexity, and high annotation costs. This paper presents a scalable framework
to automate semantic and sentiment annotation for Japanese American
Incarceration Oral History. Using LLMs, we construct a high-quality dataset,
evaluate multiple models, and test prompt engineering strategies in
historically sensitive contexts. Our multiphase approach combines expert
annotation, prompt design, and LLM evaluation with ChatGPT, Llama, and Qwen. We
labeled 558 sentences from 15 narrators for sentiment and semantic
classification, then evaluated zero-shot, few-shot, and RAG strategies. For
semantic classification, ChatGPT achieved the highest F1 score (88.71%),
followed by Llama (84.99%) and Qwen (83.72%). For sentiment analysis, Llama
slightly outperformed Qwen (82.66%) and ChatGPT (82.29%), with all models
showing comparable results. The best prompt configurations were used to
annotate 92,191 sentences from 1,002 interviews in the JAIOH collection. Our
findings show that LLMs can effectively perform semantic and sentiment
annotation across large oral history collections when guided by well-designed
prompts. This study provides a reusable annotation pipeline and practical
guidance for applying LLMs in culturally sensitive archival analysis. By
bridging archival ethics with scalable NLP techniques, this work lays the
groundwork for responsible use of artificial intelligence in digital humanities
and preservation of collective memory. GitHub:

TL;DR: 论文探讨了多轮越狱（multi-turn jailbreaking）对大型语言模型（LLMs）的安全威胁，提出了一种新的基准测试MTJ-Bench，并呼吁社区关注此类安全问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱研究仅关注单轮攻击，而LLMs能处理多轮对话，因此多轮越狱可能带来更严重的安全威胁。

Method: 构建了多轮越狱基准测试MTJ-Bench，用于评估开源和闭源模型的多轮越狱表现。

Result: 揭示了多轮越狱的新漏洞，为LLMs的安全性提供了新见解。

Conclusion: 呼吁社区共同努力构建更安全的LLMs，并深入研究越狱问题。

Abstract: Current jailbreaking work on large language models (LLMs) aims to elicit
unsafe outputs from given prompts. However, it only focuses on single-turn
jailbreaking targeting one specific query. On the contrary, the advanced LLMs
are designed to handle extremely long contexts and can thus conduct multi-turn
conversations. So, we propose exploring multi-turn jailbreaking, in which the
jailbroken LLMs are continuously tested on more than the first-turn
conversation or a single target query. This is an even more serious threat
because 1) it is common for users to continue asking relevant follow-up
questions to clarify certain jailbroken details, and 2) it is also possible
that the initial round of jailbreaking causes the LLMs to respond to additional
irrelevant questions consistently. As the first step (First draft done at June
2024) in exploring multi-turn jailbreaking, we construct a Multi-Turn Jailbreak
Benchmark (MTJ-Bench) for benchmarking this setting on a series of open- and
closed-source models and provide novel insights into this new safety threat. By
revealing this new vulnerability, we aim to call for community efforts to build
safer LLMs and pave the way for a more in-depth understanding of jailbreaking
LLMs.

Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型在讽刺检测中存在单视角分析、静态推理路径和幻觉问题，影响了准确性和可靠性。

Method: 提出SEVADE框架，采用动态代理推理引擎（DARE）和多代理协作，结合解耦评估架构，分离推理和分类。

Conclusion: SEVADE通过多代理协作和解耦评估，有效解决了讽刺检测中的幻觉问题，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Sarcasm detection is a crucial yet challenging Natural Language Processing
task. Existing Large Language Model methods are often limited by
single-perspective analysis, static reasoning pathways, and a susceptibility to
hallucination when processing complex ironic rhetoric, which impacts their
accuracy and reliability. To address these challenges, we propose **SEVADE**, a
novel **S**elf-**Ev**olving multi-agent **A**nalysis framework with
**D**ecoupled **E**valuation for hallucination-resistant sarcasm detection. The
core of our framework is a Dynamic Agentive Reasoning Engine (DARE), which
utilizes a team of specialized agents grounded in linguistic theory to perform
a multifaceted deconstruction of the text and generate a structured reasoning
chain. Subsequently, a separate lightweight rationale adjudicator (RA) performs
the final classification based solely on this reasoning chain. This decoupled
architecture is designed to mitigate the risk of hallucination by separating
complex reasoning from the final judgment. Extensive experiments on four
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with average improvements of **6.75%** in Accuracy and **6.29%**
in Macro-F1 score.

Conclusion: 提出的框架和方法能更有效地支持语言学习，生成更具教育意义的反馈。

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have contributed to the
development of automated writing evaluation (AWE) systems that can correct
grammatical errors. However, while these systems are effective at improving
text, they are not optimally designed for language learning. They favor direct
revisions, often with a click-to-fix functionality that can be applied without
considering the reason for the correction. Meanwhile, depending on the error
type, learners may benefit most from simple explanations and strategically
indirect hints, especially on generalizable grammatical rules. To support the
generation of such feedback, we introduce an annotation framework that models
each error's error type and generalizability. For error type classification, we
introduce a typology focused on inferring learners' knowledge gaps by
connecting their errors to specific grammatical patterns. Following this
framework, we collect a dataset of annotated learner errors and corresponding
human-written feedback comments, each labeled as a direct correction or hint.
With this data, we evaluate keyword-guided, keyword-free, and template-guided
methods of generating feedback using large language models (LLMs). Human
teachers examined each system's outputs, assessing them on grounds including
relevance, factuality, and comprehensibility. We report on the development of
the dataset and the comparative performance of the systems investigated.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效合并数据集，并在低资源金融领域提升NER性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为多源NER语料库整合提供了高效、可解释且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in natural language
processing. It remains a research hotspot due to its wide applicability across
domains. Although recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved
NER performance, they rely heavily on large, high-quality annotated datasets.
However, building these datasets is expensive and time-consuming, posing a
major bottleneck for further research. Current dataset merging approaches
mainly focus on strategies like manual label mapping or constructing label
graphs, which lack interpretability and scalability. To address this, we
propose an automatic label alignment method based on label similarity. The
method combines empirical and semantic similarities, using a greedy pairwise
merging strategy to unify label spaces across different datasets. Experiments
are conducted in two stages: first, merging three existing NER datasets into a
unified corpus with minimal impact on NER performance; second, integrating this
corpus with a small-scale, self-built dataset in the financial domain. The
results show that our method enables effective dataset merging and enhances NER
performance in the low-resource financial domain. This study presents an
efficient, interpretable, and scalable solution for integrating multi-source
NER corpora.

Conclusion: ReQAP通过透明化答案来源，提升了系统的可理解性和用户信任度。

Abstract: Personal information is abundant on users' devices, from structured data in
calendar, shopping records or fitness tools, to unstructured contents in mail
and social media posts. This works presents the ReQAP system that supports
users with answers for complex questions that involve filters, joins and
aggregation over heterogeneous sources. The unique trait of ReQAP is that it
recursively decomposes questions and incrementally builds an operator tree for
execution. Both the question interpretation and the individual operators make
smart use of light-weight language models, with judicious fine-tuning. The demo
showcases the rich functionality for advanced user questions, and also offers
detailed tracking of how the answers are computed by the operators in the
execution tree. Being able to trace answers back to the underlying sources is
vital for human comprehensibility and user trust in the system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话数据多样性有限，导致大型语言模型在角色一致性对话生成中表现不佳。

Method: SBS框架在训练中结合增强响应与质量评分，并在推理阶段利用这一知识。采用名词替换增强和语义相似度评分。

Result: 在PERSONA-CHAT和ConvAI2数据集上，SBS优于现有方法，提升了模型对角色一致性对话的捕捉能力。

Conclusion: SBS通过评分条件训练，显著提升了角色一致性对话生成的效果，且训练中引入评分优于传统方法。

Abstract: Persona-based dialogue generation is an important milestone towards building
conversational artificial intelligence. Despite the ever-improving capabilities
of large language models (LLMs), effectively integrating persona fidelity in
conversations remains challenging due to the limited diversity in existing
dialogue data. We propose a novel framework SBS (Score-Before-Speaking), which
outperforms previous methods and yields improvements for both million and
billion-parameter models. Unlike previous methods, SBS unifies the learning of
responses and their relative quality into a single step. The key innovation is
to train a dialogue model to correlate augmented responses with a quality score
during training and then leverage this knowledge at inference. We use
noun-based substitution for augmentation and semantic similarity-based scores
as a proxy for response quality. Through extensive experiments with benchmark
datasets (PERSONA-CHAT and ConvAI2), we show that score-conditioned training
allows existing models to better capture a spectrum of persona-consistent
dialogues. Our ablation studies also demonstrate that including scores in the
input prompt during training is superior to conventional training setups. Code

TL;DR: SentiDetect是一种模型无关的框架，通过分析情感分布稳定性差异来检测LLM生成的文本，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测方法泛化性差且易受攻击，而LLM生成文本情感一致性较高，人类文本情感变化更大。

Method: 定义两个互补指标（情感分布一致性和情感分布保持性）量化情感稳定性，并在多种数据集和LLM上评估。

Result: 在Gemini-1.5-Pro和GPT-4-0613上F1分数分别提升16%和11%，且对攻击和文本长度变化更鲁棒。

Conclusion: SentiDetect在检测LLM生成文本方面表现优越，尤其在对抗攻击和跨域场景中更具鲁棒性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has resulted in
increasingly sophisticated AI-generated content, posing significant challenges
in distinguishing LLM-generated text from human-written language. Existing
detection methods, primarily based on lexical heuristics or fine-tuned
classifiers, often suffer from limited generalizability and are vulnerable to
paraphrasing, adversarial perturbations, and cross-domain shifts. In this work,
we propose SentiDetect, a model-agnostic framework for detecting LLM-generated
text by analyzing the divergence in sentiment distribution stability. Our
method is motivated by the empirical observation that LLM outputs tend to
exhibit emotionally consistent patterns, whereas human-written texts display
greater emotional variability. To capture this phenomenon, we define two
complementary metrics: sentiment distribution consistency and sentiment
distribution preservation, which quantify stability under sentiment-altering
and semantic-preserving transformations. We evaluate SentiDetect on five
diverse datasets and a range of advanced LLMs,including Gemini-1.5-Pro,
Claude-3, GPT-4-0613, and LLaMa-3.3. Experimental results demonstrate its
superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, with over 16% and 11% F1 score
improvements on Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4-0613, respectively. Moreover,
SentiDetect also shows greater robustness to paraphrasing, adversarial attacks,
and text length variations, outperforming existing detectors in challenging
scenarios.

Conclusion: 模型集成和指令调优语言模型的结合有效解决了低资源问答领域的挑战。

Abstract: Quranic Question Answering presents unique challenges due to the linguistic
complexity of Classical Arabic and the semantic richness of religious texts. In
this paper, we propose a novel two-stage framework that addresses both passage
retrieval and answer extraction. For passage retrieval, we ensemble fine-tuned
Arabic language models to achieve superior ranking performance. For answer
extraction, we employ instruction-tuned large language models with few-shot
prompting to overcome the limitations of fine-tuning on small datasets. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the Quran QA 2023 Shared Task,
with a MAP@10 of 0.3128 and MRR@10 of 0.5763 for retrieval, and a pAP@10 of
0.669 for extraction, substantially outperforming previous methods. These
results demonstrate that combining model ensembling and instruction-tuned
language models effectively addresses the challenges of low-resource question
answering in specialized domains.

Motivation: 现有方法通常从头训练1位LLM，无法充分利用预训练模型，导致高训练成本和精度下降。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不同规模的LLM上优于现有方法，实现了高性能的1位LLM。

Conclusion: 通过预训练模型实现高性能1位LLM，避免了昂贵的从头训练。

Abstract: 1-bit LLM quantization offers significant advantages in reducing storage and
computational costs. However, existing methods typically train 1-bit LLMs from
scratch, failing to fully leverage pre-trained models. This results in high
training costs and notable accuracy degradation. We identify that the large gap
between full precision and 1-bit representations makes direct adaptation
difficult. In this paper, we introduce a consistent progressive training for
both forward and backward, smoothly converting the floating-point weights into
the binarized ones. Additionally, we incorporate binary-aware initialization
and dual-scaling compensation to reduce the difficulty of progressive training
and improve the performance. Experimental results on LLMs of various sizes
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. Our results show
that high-performance 1-bit LLMs can be achieved using pre-trained models,
eliminating the need for expensive training from scratch.

Motivation: 解决基于LLM的摘要方法在上下文长度限制、可解释性和可控性以及扩展性方面的局限性。

Method: 使用语义嵌入空间的均值向量表示文档集合，通过嵌入反演生成摘要，并引入高斯分布的随机性以提高重建质量。

Result: Vec2Summ能够生成主题覆盖和效率与直接LLM摘要相当的连贯摘要，但在细节上稍逊。

Conclusion: Vec2Summ在需要扩展性、语义控制和语料库级别抽象的场合具有潜力。

Abstract: We propose Vec2Summ, a novel method for abstractive summarization that frames
the task as semantic compression. Vec2Summ represents a document collection
using a single mean vector in the semantic embedding space, capturing the
central meaning of the corpus. To reconstruct fluent summaries, we perform
embedding inversion -- decoding this mean vector into natural language using a
generative language model. To improve reconstruction quality and capture some
degree of topical variability, we introduce stochasticity by sampling from a
Gaussian distribution centered on the mean. This approach is loosely analogous
to bagging in ensemble learning, where controlled randomness encourages more
robust and varied outputs. Vec2Summ addresses key limitations of LLM-based
summarization methods. It avoids context-length constraints, enables
interpretable and controllable generation via semantic parameters, and scales
efficiently with corpus size -- requiring only $O(d + d^2)$ parameters.
Empirical results show that Vec2Summ produces coherent summaries for topically
focused, order-invariant corpora, with performance comparable to direct LLM
summarization in terms of thematic coverage and efficiency, albeit with less
fine-grained detail. These results underscore Vec2Summ's potential in settings
where scalability, semantic control, and corpus-level abstraction are
prioritized.

Motivation: 现有偏见评测基准（如BBQ）主要关注西方语境，无法适用于印度多语言和文化背景，因此需要开发本土化评测工具。

Method: 通过翻译和验证，将49,108个例子扩展到8种语言的392,864个例子，覆盖13个社会类别（包括3个交叉群体），并评估5个多语言模型。

Conclusion: BharatBBQ为印度多语言和文化背景的偏见评测提供了有效工具，揭示了模型偏见的普遍性和本土化评测的重要性。

Abstract: Evaluating social biases in language models (LMs) is crucial for ensuring
fairness and minimizing the reinforcement of harmful stereotypes in AI systems.
Existing benchmarks, such as the Bias Benchmark for Question Answering (BBQ),
primarily focus on Western contexts, limiting their applicability to the Indian
context. To address this gap, we introduce BharatBBQ, a culturally adapted
benchmark designed to assess biases in Hindi, English, Marathi, Bengali, Tamil,
Telugu, Odia, and Assamese. BharatBBQ covers 13 social categories, including 3
intersectional groups, reflecting prevalent biases in the Indian sociocultural
landscape. Our dataset contains 49,108 examples in one language that are
expanded using translation and verification to 392,864 examples in eight
different languages. We evaluate five multilingual LM families across zero and
few-shot settings, analyzing their bias and stereotypical bias scores. Our
findings highlight persistent biases across languages and social categories and
often amplified biases in Indian languages compared to English, demonstrating
the necessity of linguistically and culturally grounded benchmarks for bias
evaluation.

Motivation: 解决现有稀疏注意力机制在长生成推理中因累积误差导致的准确性下降问题，同时减少计算开销。

Method: 利用全局注意力模式聚合局部注意力头的令牌选择，统一跨头令牌排名，避免为每个头维护单独令牌子集。

Result: 在多样推理任务中，LessIsMore保持甚至提升准确性，解码速度平均提升1.1倍，令牌关注数减少2倍。

Conclusion: LessIsMore在效率和准确性上均优于现有稀疏注意力方法，实现了端到端速度提升1.13倍。

Abstract: Large reasoning models achieve strong performance through test-time scaling
but incur substantial computational overhead, particularly from excessive token
generation when processing short input prompts. While sparse attention
mechanisms can reduce latency and memory usage, existing approaches suffer from
significant accuracy degradation due to accumulated errors during
long-generation reasoning. These methods generally require either high token
retention rates or expensive retraining. We introduce LessIsMore, a
training-free sparse attention mechanism for reasoning tasks, which leverages
global attention patterns rather than relying on traditional head-specific
local optimizations. LessIsMore aggregates token selections from local
attention heads with recent contextual information, enabling unified cross-head
token ranking for future decoding layers. This unified selection improves
generalization and efficiency by avoiding the need to maintain separate token
subsets per head. Evaluation across diverse reasoning tasks and benchmarks
shows that LessIsMore preserves -- and in some cases improves -- accuracy while
achieving a $1.1\times$ average decoding speed-up compared to full attention.
Moreover, LessIsMore attends to $2\times$ fewer tokens without accuracy loss,
achieving a $1.13\times$ end-to-end speed-up compared to existing sparse
attention methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统可能反映和加剧社会偏见，尤其是在资源受限的决策支持场景中，如招聘和招生。现有研究多关注单一维度偏见，而交叉性偏见的影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过扩展WinoBias数据集，创建WinoIdentity基准，包含245,700个提示，评估50种偏见模式。提出Coreference Confidence Disparity度量标准，分析模型对不同交叉性身份的置信度差异。

Result: 评估了五个最新LLMs，发现置信度差异高达40%，模型在反刻板印象设置中对双重弱势身份最不确定。

Conclusion: LLMs的优异表现可能源于记忆而非逻辑推理，存在价值对齐和有效性的双重失败，可能导致社会危害。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance, leading to
their widespread adoption as decision-support tools in resource-constrained
contexts like hiring and admissions. There is, however, scientific consensus
that AI systems can reflect and exacerbate societal biases, raising concerns
about identity-based harm when used in critical social contexts. Prior work has
laid a solid foundation for assessing bias in LLMs by evaluating demographic
disparities in different language reasoning tasks. In this work, we extend
single-axis fairness evaluations to examine intersectional bias, recognizing
that when multiple axes of discrimination intersect, they create distinct
patterns of disadvantage. We create a new benchmark called WinoIdentity by
augmenting the WinoBias dataset with 25 demographic markers across 10
attributes, including age, nationality, and race, intersected with binary
gender, yielding 245,700 prompts to evaluate 50 distinct bias patterns.
Focusing on harms of omission due to underrepresentation, we investigate bias
through the lens of uncertainty and propose a group (un)fairness metric called
Coreference Confidence Disparity which measures whether models are more or less
confident for some intersectional identities than others. We evaluate five
recently published LLMs and find confidence disparities as high as 40% along
various demographic attributes including body type, sexual orientation and
socio-economic status, with models being most uncertain about
doubly-disadvantaged identities in anti-stereotypical settings. Surprisingly,
coreference confidence decreases even for hegemonic or privileged markers,
indicating that the recent impressive performance of LLMs is more likely due to
memorization than logical reasoning. Notably, these are two independent
failures in value alignment and validity that can compound to cause social
harm.

### [30] [Fairness of Automatic Speech Recognition: Looking Through a Philosophical Lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07143)
*Anna Seo Gyeong Choi,Hoon Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了自动语音识别（ASR）系统对非标准方言的偏见问题，指出其不仅是技术限制，更是一种对边缘化语言社区的不尊重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ASR系统公平性，揭示其对非标准方言的偏见如何转化为有害歧视，并探讨其独特的伦理维度。

Method: 通过哲学视角分析ASR偏见的伦理问题，区分技术分类与有害歧视，并识别三个独特的伦理维度。

Result: 发现ASR偏见涉及时间负担、对话流中断和身份认同问题，现有技术公平指标未能捕捉这些不对称权力关系。

Conclusion: 解决ASR偏见需超越技术干预，承认多样语言表达的合法性，以尊重语言多样性和说话者自主性。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems now mediate countless
human-technology interactions, yet research on their fairness implications
remains surprisingly limited. This paper examines ASR bias through a
philosophical lens, arguing that systematic misrecognition of certain speech
varieties constitutes more than a technical limitation -- it represents a form
of disrespect that compounds historical injustices against marginalized
linguistic communities. We distinguish between morally neutral classification
(discriminate1) and harmful discrimination (discriminate2), demonstrating how
ASR systems can inadvertently transform the former into the latter when they
consistently misrecognize non-standard dialects. We identify three unique
ethical dimensions of speech technologies that differentiate ASR bias from
other algorithmic fairness concerns: the temporal burden placed on speakers of
non-standard varieties ("temporal taxation"), the disruption of conversational
flow when systems misrecognize speech, and the fundamental connection between
speech patterns and personal/cultural identity. These factors create asymmetric
power relationships that existing technical fairness metrics fail to capture.
The paper analyzes the tension between linguistic standardization and pluralism
in ASR development, arguing that current approaches often embed and reinforce
problematic language ideologies. We conclude that addressing ASR bias requires
more than technical interventions; it demands recognition of diverse speech
varieties as legitimate forms of expression worthy of technological
accommodation. This philosophical reframing offers new pathways for developing
ASR systems that respect linguistic diversity and speaker autonomy.

TL;DR: 论文提出SafeGrad方法，通过梯度手术解决恶意样本在微调数据集中破坏LLM安全对齐的问题，保持任务性能的同时提升安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在高恶意样本比例下安全性急剧下降，原因是用户任务梯度与安全目标梯度冲突。

Method: 提出SafeGrad方法，检测梯度冲突时，将用户任务梯度投影到安全梯度的正交平面，避免冲突；并采用KL散度对齐损失增强鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明SafeGrad在各种LLM和数据集上提供最优防御，即使高恶意比例下仍保持安全性和任务性能。

Conclusion: SafeGrad有效解决了安全微调中的梯度冲突问题，为LLM安全对齐提供了新思路。

Abstract: Fine-tuning-as-a-Service introduces a critical vulnerability where a few
malicious examples mixed into the user's fine-tuning dataset can compromise the
safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs). While a recognized paradigm
frames safe fine-tuning as a multi-objective optimization problem balancing
user task performance with safety alignment, we find existing solutions are
critically sensitive to the harmful ratio, with defenses degrading sharply as
harmful ratio increases. We diagnose that this failure stems from conflicting
gradients, where the user-task update directly undermines the safety objective.
To resolve this, we propose SafeGrad, a novel method that employs gradient
surgery. When a conflict is detected, SafeGrad nullifies the harmful component
of the user-task gradient by projecting it onto the orthogonal plane of the
alignment gradient, allowing the model to learn the user's task without
sacrificing safety. To further enhance robustness and data efficiency, we
employ a KL-divergence alignment loss that learns the rich, distributional
safety profile of the well-aligned foundation model. Extensive experiments show
that SafeGrad provides state-of-the-art defense across various LLMs and
datasets, maintaining robust safety even at high harmful ratios without
compromising task fidelity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个针对全模态大语言模型（OLLMs）安全评估的综合基准Omni-SafetyBench，填补了现有评估工具的空白，并揭示了OLLMs在复杂输入下的安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏专门用于评估OLLMs安全性的基准，且现有基准无法评估多模态联合输入或跨模态安全一致性。

Method: 提出了Omni-SafetyBench基准，包含24种模态组合和972个样本，并设计了基于条件攻击成功率（C-ASR）和拒绝率（C-RR）的安全评分（Safety-score）以及跨模态安全一致性评分（CMSC-score）。

Result: 评估10个OLLMs发现：（1）无模型在整体安全性和一致性上表现优异；（2）复杂输入（尤其是视听联合）削弱安全防御；（3）部分模型在特定模态下评分低至0.14。

Conclusion: 研究强调了提升OLLM安全性的迫切需求，为未来改进提供了基础。

Abstract: The rise of Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs), which integrate visual
and auditory processing with text, necessitates robust safety evaluations to
mitigate harmful outputs. However, no dedicated benchmarks currently exist for
OLLMs, and prior benchmarks designed for other LLMs lack the ability to assess
safety performance under audio-visual joint inputs or cross-modal safety
consistency. To fill this gap, we introduce Omni-SafetyBench, the first
comprehensive parallel benchmark for OLLM safety evaluation, featuring 24
modality combinations and variations with 972 samples each, including dedicated
audio-visual harm cases. Considering OLLMs' comprehension challenges with
complex omni-modal inputs and the need for cross-modal consistency evaluation,
we propose tailored metrics: a Safety-score based on conditional Attack Success
Rate (C-ASR) and Refusal Rate (C-RR) to account for comprehension failures, and
a Cross-Modal Safety Consistency Score (CMSC-score) to measure consistency
across modalities. Evaluating 6 open-source and 4 closed-source OLLMs reveals
critical vulnerabilities: (1) no model excels in both overall safety and
consistency, with only 3 models achieving over 0.6 in both metrics and top
performer scoring around 0.8; (2) safety defenses weaken with complex inputs,
especially audio-visual joints; (3) severe weaknesses persist, with some models
scoring as low as 0.14 on specific modalities. Our benchmark and metrics
highlight urgent needs for enhanced OLLM safety, providing a foundation for
future improvements.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过去噪隐式反馈中的虚假兴趣（PHG-DIF）的个性化标题生成框架，以解决现有方法忽略点击噪声导致标题偏离用户真实兴趣的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能有效处理历史点击流中的个性化无关噪声，导致生成的标题偏离用户真实兴趣。

Method: PHG-DIF采用双阶段过滤去除噪声（如短停留时间和异常点击爆发），并通过多级时间融合动态建模用户兴趣。

Result: 实验表明，PHG-DIF显著减少了点击噪声的负面影响，并在新数据集DT-PENS上实现了SOTA效果。

Conclusion: PHG-DIF通过去噪和动态兴趣建模，显著提升了个性化标题生成的质量。

Abstract: Accurate personalized headline generation hinges on precisely capturing user
interests from historical behaviors. However, existing methods neglect
personalized-irrelevant click noise in entire historical clickstreams, which
may lead to hallucinated headlines that deviate from genuine user preferences.
In this paper, we reveal the detrimental impact of click noise on personalized
generation quality through rigorous analysis in both user and news dimensions.
Based on these insights, we propose a novel Personalized Headline Generation
framework via Denoising Fake Interests from Implicit Feedback (PHG-DIF).
PHG-DIF first employs dual-stage filtering to effectively remove clickstream
noise, identified by short dwell times and abnormal click bursts, and then
leverages multi-level temporal fusion to dynamically model users' evolving and
multi-faceted interests for precise profiling. Moreover, we release DT-PENS, a
new benchmark dataset comprising the click behavior of 1,000 carefully curated
users and nearly 10,000 annotated personalized headlines with historical dwell
time annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PHG-DIF substantially
mitigates the adverse effects of click noise and significantly improves
headline quality, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on DT-PENS. Our
framework implementation and dataset are available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业数据管道中的语义漂移问题影响了数据可重现性和治理，降低了RAG和文本到SQL系统的实用性。

Method: 提出了一种自动化提取模式谱系的框架，识别源模式、源表、转换逻辑和聚合操作，并引入SLiCE评估指标。

Result: 实验显示，模型规模和提示技术的提升能显著提高性能，32B开源模型在单次推理中表现接近GPT系列。

Conclusion: 该框架为实际应用中部署模式感知代理提供了一种可扩展且经济的解决方案。

Abstract: Enterprise data pipelines, characterized by complex transformations across
multiple programming languages, often cause a semantic disconnect between
original metadata and downstream data. This "semantic drift" compromises data
reproducibility and governance, and impairs the utility of services like
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and text-to-SQL systems. To address this,
a novel framework is proposed for the automated extraction of fine-grained
schema lineage from multilingual enterprise pipeline scripts. This method
identifies four key components: source schemas, source tables, transformation
logic, and aggregation operations, creating a standardized representation of
data transformations. For the rigorous evaluation of lineage quality, this
paper introduces the Schema Lineage Composite Evaluation (SLiCE), a metric that
assesses both structural correctness and semantic fidelity. A new benchmark is
also presented, comprising 1,700 manually annotated lineages from real-world
industrial scripts. Experiments were conducted with 12 language models, from
1.3B to 32B small language models (SLMs) to large language models (LLMs) like
GPT-4o and GPT-4.1. The results demonstrate that the performance of schema
lineage extraction scales with model size and the sophistication of prompting
techniques. Specially, a 32B open-source model, using a single reasoning trace,
can achieve performance comparable to the GPT series under standard prompting.
This finding suggests a scalable and economical approach for deploying
schema-aware agents in practical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的知识是静态且易过时，重新训练成本高，现有知识编辑技术效率低且可能产生副作用。

Method: 结合动态知识图谱和稀疏知识注意力机制，实现粗到细的搜索，高效聚焦相关子集。

Result: 在时效性问答任务中，DySK-Attn在事实准确性和计算效率上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DySK-Attn为构建实时更新的大语言模型提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a critical limitation: their
knowledge is static and quickly becomes outdated. Retraining these massive
models is computationally prohibitive, while existing knowledge editing
techniques can be slow and may introduce unforeseen side effects. To address
this, we propose DySK-Attn, a novel framework that enables LLMs to efficiently
integrate real-time knowledge from a dynamic external source. Our approach
synergizes an LLM with a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) that can be updated
instantaneously. The core of our framework is a sparse knowledge attention
mechanism, which allows the LLM to perform a coarse-to-fine grained search,
efficiently identifying and focusing on a small, highly relevant subset of
facts from the vast KG. This mechanism avoids the high computational cost of
dense attention over the entire knowledge base and mitigates noise from
irrelevant information. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on
time-sensitive question-answering tasks that DySK-Attn significantly
outperforms strong baselines, including standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) and model editing techniques, in both factual accuracy for updated
knowledge and computational efficiency. Our framework offers a scalable and
effective solution for building LLMs that can stay current with the
ever-changing world.

Motivation: LLM在时间序列预测中面临时间模式异质性和模态差异的挑战。

Method: 设计异构时间编码器和语义对齐模块，将时间序列特征与LLM兼容表示对齐。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，TALON平均MSE提升11%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TALON通过模式感知和语义感知设计，有效适配LLM于时间序列预测。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive
capabilities in natural language processing due to their strong generalization
and sequence modeling capabilities. However, their direct application to time
series forecasting remains challenging due to two fundamental issues: the
inherent heterogeneity of temporal patterns and the modality gap between
continuous numerical signals and discrete language representations. In this
work, we propose TALON, a unified framework that enhances LLM-based forecasting
by modeling temporal heterogeneity and enforcing semantic alignment.
Specifically, we design a Heterogeneous Temporal Encoder that partitions
multivariate time series into structurally coherent segments, enabling
localized expert modeling across diverse temporal patterns. To bridge the
modality gap, we introduce a Semantic Alignment Module that aligns temporal
features with LLM-compatible representations, enabling effective integration of
time series into language-based models while eliminating the need for
handcrafted prompts during inference. Extensive experiments on seven real-world
benchmarks demonstrate that TALON achieves superior performance across all
datasets, with average MSE improvements of up to 11\% over recent
state-of-the-art methods. These results underscore the effectiveness of
incorporating both pattern-aware and semantic-aware designs when adapting LLMs
for time series forecasting. The code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PLMs在社交媒体任务（如谣言检测）中表现不佳，原因是预训练语料与社交文本不匹配、社交符号处理不足以及预训练任务不适合建模传播结构中的用户互动。

Method: 提出PEP策略，预测帖子间的根、分支和父关系，并发布TwitterCorpus和两个未标记的传播结构数据集。训练了一个名为SoLM的Twitter定制PLM。

Conclusion: PEP策略有效学习帖子互动特征，显著提升谣言检测性能，证明了其在社交媒体任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) have excelled in various Natural Language
Processing tasks, benefiting from large-scale pretraining and self-attention
mechanism's ability to capture long-range dependencies. However, their
performance on social media application tasks like rumor detection remains
suboptimal. We attribute this to mismatches between pretraining corpora and
social texts, inadequate handling of unique social symbols, and pretraining
tasks ill-suited for modeling user engagements implicit in propagation
structures. To address these issues, we propose a continue pretraining strategy
called Post Engagement Prediction (PEP) to infuse information from propagation
structures into PLMs. PEP makes models to predict root, branch, and parent
relations between posts, capturing interactions of stance and sentiment crucial
for rumor detection. We also curate and release large-scale Twitter corpus:
TwitterCorpus (269GB text), and two unlabeled claim conversation datasets with
propagation structures (UTwitter and UWeibo). Utilizing these resources and PEP
strategy, we train a Twitter-tailored PLM called SoLM. Extensive experiments
demonstrate PEP significantly boosts rumor detection performance across
universal and social media PLMs, even in few-shot scenarios. On benchmark
datasets, PEP enhances baseline models by 1.0-3.7\% accuracy, even enabling it
to outperform current state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets. SoLM
alone, without high-level modules, also achieves competitive results,
highlighting the strategy's effectiveness in learning discriminative post
interaction features.

Conclusion: 深度学习能从自然数据中学习分布式的重音线索，扩展了传统语音学的研究范围。

Abstract: Despite their success in speech processing, neural networks often operate as
black boxes, prompting the question: what informs their decisions, and how can
we interpret them? This work examines this issue in the context of lexical
stress. A dataset of English disyllabic words was automatically constructed
from read and spontaneous speech. Several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
architectures were trained to predict stress position from a spectrographic
representation of disyllabic words lacking minimal stress pairs (e.g., initial
stress WAllet, final stress exTEND), achieving up to 92% accuracy on held-out
test data. Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP), a technique for CNN
interpretability analysis, revealed that predictions for held-out minimal pairs
(PROtest vs. proTEST ) were most strongly influenced by information in stressed
versus unstressed syllables, particularly the spectral properties of stressed
vowels. However, the classifiers also attended to information throughout the
word. A feature-specific relevance analysis is proposed, and its results
suggest that our best-performing classifier is strongly influenced by the
stressed vowel's first and second formants, with some evidence that its pitch
and third formant also contribute. These results reveal deep learning's ability
to acquire distributed cues to stress from naturally occurring data, extending
traditional phonetic work based around highly controlled stimuli.

Conclusion: 通过提示调优和记忆演示模板的结合，有效解决了少样本蒸馏困境，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation has been successfully applied to Continual Learning
Named Entity Recognition (CLNER) tasks, by using a teacher model trained on
old-class data to distill old-class entities present in new-class data as a
form of regularization, thereby avoiding catastrophic forgetting. However, in
Few-Shot CLNER (FS-CLNER) tasks, the scarcity of new-class entities makes it
difficult for the trained model to generalize during inference. More
critically, the lack of old-class entity information hinders the distillation
of old knowledge, causing the model to fall into what we refer to as the
Few-Shot Distillation Dilemma. In this work, we address the above challenges
through a prompt tuning paradigm and memory demonstration template strategy.
Specifically, we designed an expandable Anchor words-oriented Prompt Tuning
(APT) paradigm to bridge the gap between pre-training and fine-tuning, thereby
enhancing performance in few-shot scenarios. Additionally, we incorporated
Memory Demonstration Templates (MDT) into each training instance to provide
replay samples from previous tasks, which not only avoids the Few-Shot
Distillation Dilemma but also promotes in-context learning. Experiments show
that our approach achieves competitive performances on FS-CLNER.

Abstract: This paper describes an extension of the two-dimensional dynamic articulatory
model DYNARTmo by integrating an internal three-dimensional representation of
the palatal dome to estimate tongue-palate contact areas from midsagittal
tongue contours. Two alternative dome geometries - a half-ellipse and a cosine
based profile - are implemented to model lateral curvature in the coronal
plane. Using these geometries, lateral contact points are analytically computed
for each anterior-posterior position, enabling the generation of
electropalatography-like visualizations within the 2D+ framework. The enhanced
model supports three synchronized views (sagittal, glottal, and palatal) for
static and dynamic (animated) articulation displays, suitable for speech
science education and speech therapy. Future work includes adding a facial
(lip) view and implementing articulatory-to-acoustic synthesis to
quantitatively evaluate model realism.

Conclusion: 结合显式和隐式方法能有效提升语音语言模型对上下文副语言的理解能力。

Abstract: Current large speech language models (Speech-LLMs) often exhibit limitations
in empathetic reasoning, primarily due to the absence of training datasets that
integrate both contextual content and paralinguistic cues. In this work, we
propose two approaches to incorporate contextual paralinguistic information
into model training: (1) an explicit method that provides paralinguistic
metadata (e.g., emotion annotations) directly to the LLM, and (2) an implicit
method that automatically generates novel training question-answer (QA) pairs
using both categorical and dimensional emotion annotations alongside speech
transcriptions. Our implicit method boosts performance (LLM-judged) by 38.41%
on a human-annotated QA benchmark, reaching 46.02% when combined with the
explicit approach, showing effectiveness in contextual paralinguistic
understanding. We also validate the LLM judge by demonstrating its correlation
with classification metrics, providing support for its reliability.

Result: MAQuA将问题数量减少50-87%，在抑郁和饮食障碍等领域表现稳健。

Conclusion: MAQuA是一种高效、可扩展的心理健康筛查工具，适合临床工作流。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for
scalable, interactive mental health assessment, but excessive querying by LLMs
burdens users and is inefficient for real-world screening across
transdiagnostic symptom profiles. We introduce MAQuA, an adaptive
question-asking framework for simultaneous, multidimensional mental health
screening. Combining multi-outcome modeling on language responses with item
response theory (IRT) and factor analysis, MAQuA selects the questions with
most informative responses across multiple dimensions at each turn to optimize
diagnostic information, improving accuracy and potentially reducing response
burden. Empirical results on a novel dataset reveal that MAQuA reduces the
number of assessment questions required for score stabilization by 50-87%
compared to random ordering (e.g., achieving stable depression scores with 71%
fewer questions and eating disorder scores with 85% fewer questions). MAQuA
demonstrates robust performance across both internalizing (depression, anxiety)
and externalizing (substance use, eating disorder) domains, with early stopping
strategies further reducing patient time and burden. These findings position
MAQuA as a powerful and efficient tool for scalable, nuanced, and interactive
mental health screening, advancing the integration of LLM-based agents into
real-world clinical workflows.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了14种大型语言模型（LLM）在27种电车问题场景中的道德推理能力，发现模型在不同伦理框架下表现差异显著，尤其在利他主义、公平和美德伦理框架中表现较好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM越来越多地参与伦理敏感决策，理解其道德推理过程变得至关重要。

Method: 研究通过因子提示协议，收集了3,780个二元决策和自然语言解释，分析了决策果断性、解释一致性、公共道德对齐及对无关伦理线索的敏感性。

Result: 研究发现，增强推理能力的模型表现更果断且解释更结构化，但并不总是与人类共识更一致；模型在利他主义等框架中表现较好，但在亲属关系或法律框架中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究建议将道德推理作为LLM对齐的主要维度，并呼吁建立标准化基准以评估LLM的决策过程和原因。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate ethically sensitive
decisions, understanding their moral reasoning processes becomes imperative.
This study presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of 14 leading LLMs,
both reasoning enabled and general purpose, across 27 diverse trolley problem
scenarios, framed by ten moral philosophies, including utilitarianism,
deontology, and altruism. Using a factorial prompting protocol, we elicited
3,780 binary decisions and natural language justifications, enabling analysis
along axes of decisional assertiveness, explanation answer consistency, public
moral alignment, and sensitivity to ethically irrelevant cues. Our findings
reveal significant variability across ethical frames and model types: reasoning
enhanced models demonstrate greater decisiveness and structured justifications,
yet do not always align better with human consensus. Notably, "sweet zones"
emerge in altruistic, fairness, and virtue ethics framings, where models
achieve a balance of high intervention rates, low explanation conflict, and
minimal divergence from aggregated human judgments. However, models diverge
under frames emphasizing kinship, legality, or self interest, often producing
ethically controversial outcomes. These patterns suggest that moral prompting
is not only a behavioral modifier but also a diagnostic tool for uncovering
latent alignment philosophies across providers. We advocate for moral reasoning
to become a primary axis in LLM alignment, calling for standardized benchmarks
that evaluate not just what LLMs decide, but how and why.

TL;DR: 论文提出ARCE方法，通过LLM生成简单解释（Cote）增强RoBERTa模型，在AEC领域NER任务中取得77.20%的Macro-F1分数，优于复杂方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AEC领域NER任务中预训练模型因领域术语和复杂关系导致的性能受限问题，避免高成本的人工标注。

Method: 使用LLM生成简单解释（Cote）作为知识，逐步预训练RoBERTa模型，再微调下游任务。

Result: 在AEC基准数据集上达到77.20%的Macro-F1分数，表现优于复杂方法。

Conclusion: 简单解释性知识比复杂角色推理更有效，ARCE方法为领域特定任务提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate information extraction from specialized texts is a critical
challenge, particularly for named entity recognition (NER) in the architecture,
engineering, and construction (AEC) domain to support automated rule checking
(ARC). The performance of standard pre-trained models is often constrained by
the domain gap, as they struggle to interpret the specialized terminology and
complex relational contexts inherent in AEC texts. Although this issue can be
mitigated by further pre-training on large, human-curated domain corpora, as
exemplified by methods like ARCBERT, this approach is both labor-intensive and
cost-prohibitive. Consequently, leveraging large language models (LLMs) for
automated knowledge generation has emerged as a promising alternative. However,
the optimal strategy for generating knowledge that can genuinely enhance
smaller, efficient models remains an open question. To address this, we propose
ARCE (augmented RoBERTa with contextualized elucidations), a novel approach
that systematically explores and optimizes this generation process. ARCE
employs an LLM to first generate a corpus of simple, direct explanations, which
we term Cote, and then uses this corpus to incrementally pre-train a RoBERTa
model prior to its fine-tuning on the downstream task. Our extensive
experiments show that ARCE establishes a new state-of-the-art on a benchmark
AEC dataset, achieving a Macro-F1 score of 77.20%. This result also reveals a
key finding: simple, explanation-based knowledge proves surprisingly more
effective than complex, role-based rationales for this task. The code is

*Yexing Du,Kaiyuan Liu,Youcheng Pan,Zheng Chu,Bo Yang,Xiaocheng Feng,Yang Xiang,Ming Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种跨语言和跨模态的事实性基准（CCFQA），用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在多语言和语音输入中的表现。实验表明当前MLLMs在此基准上表现不佳，并提出了一种少样本迁移学习策略，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注英语文本或视觉模态，缺乏对多语言和语音输入的事实性评估，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了包含8种语言的平行语音-文本事实性问题的CCFQA基准，并提出了一种少样本迁移学习策略，将英语问答能力迁移到多语言语音问答任务中。

Result: 实验显示当前MLLMs在CCFQA上表现不佳，但提出的迁移学习策略仅用5-shot训练即达到与GPT-4o-mini-Audio竞争的性能。

Conclusion: CCFQA为促进MLLMs在多语言和语音理解能力上的发展提供了基础研究资源。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly popularized in the
multilingual world, ensuring hallucination-free factuality becomes markedly
crucial. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating the reliability of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) predominantly focus on textual or
visual modalities with a primary emphasis on English, which creates a gap in
evaluation when processing multilingual input, especially in speech. To bridge
this gap, we propose a novel \textbf{C}ross-lingual and \textbf{C}ross-modal
\textbf{F}actuality benchmark (\textbf{CCFQA}). Specifically, the CCFQA
benchmark contains parallel speech-text factual questions across 8 languages,
designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs' cross-lingual and cross-modal
factuality capabilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that current
MLLMs still face substantial challenges on the CCFQA benchmark. Furthermore, we
propose a few-shot transfer learning strategy that effectively transfers the
Question Answering (QA) capabilities of LLMs in English to multilingual Spoken
Question Answering (SQA) tasks, achieving competitive performance with
GPT-4o-mini-Audio using just 5-shot training. We release CCFQA as a
foundational research resource to promote the development of MLLMs with more
robust and reliable speech understanding capabilities. Our code and dataset are

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ObfusQAte的新技术，并基于此构建了ObfusQA框架，用于测试大语言模型（LLMs）在面对模糊化问题时的鲁棒性。研究发现LLMs在复杂语言变化下容易失败或产生幻觉回答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在事实问答（QA）方面表现出色，但其在面对模糊化问题时的鲁棒性尚未被系统研究。

Method: 提出ObfusQAte技术和ObfusQA框架，通过三个维度（命名实体间接、干扰项间接和上下文过载）评估LLMs。

Result: LLMs在复杂语言变化下表现不佳，容易失败或产生幻觉回答。

Conclusion: ObfusQA为评估LLMs的鲁棒性和适应性提供了全面基准，并公开了ObfusQAte以促进相关研究。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly
contributed to the development of equitable AI systems capable of factual
question-answering (QA). However, no known study tests the LLMs' robustness
when presented with obfuscated versions of questions. To systematically
evaluate these limitations, we propose a novel technique, ObfusQAte and,
leveraging the same, introduce ObfusQA, a comprehensive, first of its kind,
framework with multi-tiered obfuscation levels designed to examine LLM
capabilities across three distinct dimensions: (i) Named-Entity Indirection,
(ii) Distractor Indirection, and (iii) Contextual Overload. By capturing these
fine-grained distinctions in language, ObfusQA provides a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating LLM robustness and adaptability. Our study observes
that LLMs exhibit a tendency to fail or generate hallucinated responses when
confronted with these increasingly nuanced variations. To foster research in
this direction, we make ObfusQAte publicly available.

Motivation: 理解多语言者在代码转换中的行为特征，以及探索双语语言使用的研究方法。

Method: 开发了一个能完成地图任务的聊天机器人，采用不同的代码转换策略进行实验。

Result: 参与者更喜欢可预测的代码转换行为，随机或不规范的转换会降低任务完成度和体验。

Conclusion: 研究展示了多语言技术用于双语研究的潜力，但也指出了技术不成熟可能带来的负面影响。

Abstract: Most people are multilingual, and most multilinguals code-switch, yet the
characteristics of code-switched language are not fully understood. We
developed a chatbot capable of completing a Map Task with human participants
using code-switched Spanish and English. In two experiments, we prompted the
bot to code-switch according to different strategies, examining (1) the
feasibility of such experiments for investigating bilingual language use, and
(2) whether participants would be sensitive to variations in discourse and
grammatical patterns. Participants generally enjoyed code-switching with our
bot as long as it produced predictable code-switching behavior; when
code-switching was random or ungrammatical (as when producing unattested
incongruent mixed-language noun phrases, such as `la fork'), participants
enjoyed the task less and were less successful at completing it. These results
underscore the potential downsides of deploying insufficiently developed
multilingual language technology, while also illustrating the promise of such
technology for conducting research on bilingual language use.

Motivation: 提升全双工语音语言模型（FD-SLMs）的对话能力，解决其在语音交互中的时序和长度问题。

Result: 实验表明，TurnGuide显著提升了FD-SLMs的对话能力，生成更自然连贯的语音。

Conclusion: TurnGuide有效解决了FD-SLMs的时序和长度问题，提升了语音交互的自然性和语义连贯性。

Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech Language Models (FD-SLMs) are specialized foundation
models designed to enable natural, real-time spoken interactions by modeling
complex conversational dynamics such as interruptions, backchannels, and
overlapping speech, and End-to-end (e2e) FD-SLMs leverage real-world
double-channel conversational data to capture nuanced two-speaker dialogue
patterns for human-like interactions. However, they face a critical challenge
-- their conversational abilities often degrade compared to pure-text
conversation due to prolonged speech sequences and limited high-quality spoken
dialogue data. While text-guided speech generation could mitigate these issues,
it suffers from timing and length issues when integrating textual guidance into
double-channel audio streams, disrupting the precise time alignment essential
for natural interactions. To address these challenges, we propose TurnGuide, a
novel planning-inspired approach that mimics human conversational planning by
dynamically segmenting assistant speech into dialogue turns and generating
turn-level text guidance before speech output, which effectively resolves both
insertion timing and length challenges. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
approach significantly improves e2e FD-SLMs' conversational abilities, enabling
them to generate semantically meaningful and coherent speech while maintaining
natural conversational flow. Demos are available at

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在低资源语言和文化长尾实体上的表现不足问题。

Method: 利用Wikidata知识图谱收集文化相关图像，生成合成多语言视觉问答数据，训练模型CulturalPangea。

Result: CulturalPangea在文化相关多语言多模态任务上表现最佳，平均提升5.0分，且不影响主流任务性能。

Conclusion: 文化驱动的数据方法能有效缩小MLLM的文化差距，推动全球包容性多模态系统发展。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models excel in high-resource settings, but often
misinterpret long-tail cultural entities and underperform in low-resource
languages. To address this gap, we propose a data-centric approach that
directly grounds MLLMs in cultural knowledge. Leveraging a large scale
knowledge graph from Wikidata, we collect images that represent culturally
significant entities, and generate synthetic multilingual visual question
answering data. The resulting dataset, CulturalGround, comprises 22 million
high-quality, culturally-rich VQA pairs spanning 42 countries and 39 languages.
We train an open-source MLLM CulturalPangea on CulturalGround, interleaving
standard multilingual instruction-tuning data to preserve general abilities.
CulturalPangea achieves state-of-the-art performance among open models on
various culture-focused multilingual multimodal benchmarks, outperforming prior
models by an average of 5.0 without degrading results on mainstream
vision-language tasks. Our findings show that our targeted, culturally grounded
approach could substantially narrow the cultural gap in MLLMs and offer a
practical path towards globally inclusive multimodal systems.

TL;DR: ReLoc是一种统一的局部搜索框架，通过逐步代码修订提升代码生成效率，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成方法在效率和可扩展性上存在不足，如树搜索方法树规模增长快，改进方法奖励信号不明确。

Method: ReLoc通过初始代码起草、邻域代码生成、候选评估和代码更新四个组件实现局部搜索，并开发了修订奖励模型。

Result: 实验表明，ReLoc在多种代码生成任务中表现优异，优于树搜索和改进方法。

Conclusion: ReLoc为代码生成提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with inference-time scaling techniques show
promise for code generation, yet face notable efficiency and scalability
challenges. Construction-based tree-search methods suffer from rapid growth in
tree size, high token consumption, and lack of anytime property. In contrast,
improvement-based methods offer better performance but often struggle with
uninformative reward signals and inefficient search strategies. In this work,
we propose \textbf{ReLoc}, a unified local search framework which effectively
performs step-by-step code revision. Specifically, ReLoc explores a series of
local revisions through four key algorithmic components: initial code drafting,
neighborhood code generation, candidate evaluation, and incumbent code
updating, each of which can be instantiated with specific decision rules to
realize different local search algorithms such as Hill Climbing (HC) or Genetic
Algorithm (GA). Furthermore, we develop a specialized revision reward model
that evaluates code quality based on revision distance to produce fine-grained
preferences that guide the local search toward more promising candidates.
Finally, our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach
achieves superior performance across diverse code generation tasks,
significantly outperforming both construction-based tree search as well as the
state-of-the-art improvement-based code generation methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大语言模型（LLM）在长输入中存在位置偏差，如‘迷失在中间’效应（LiM），当输入占模型上下文窗口的50%以下时最明显。超过50%后，首因效应减弱，而近因效应保持稳定，最终表现为距离偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM在长输入中的位置偏差现象及其表现条件，以改进长上下文任务和评估方法。

Method: 采用相对输入长度（相对于模型上下文窗口）进行综合分析，研究LiM效应的强度和表现条件。

Result: LiM效应在输入占上下文窗口50%以下时最强；超过50%后，首因效应减弱，近因效应稳定，表现为距离偏差。检索能力是推理的前提，位置偏差主要源于检索。

Conclusion: 研究结果为长上下文任务、LLM基准设计和评估方法提供了重要启示，强调了检索在推理中的关键作用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to use information across long
inputs effectively. Prior work has identified positional biases, such as the
Lost in the Middle (LiM) effect, where models perform better when information
appears at the beginning (primacy bias) or end (recency bias) of the input,
rather than in the middle. However, long-context studies have not consistently
replicated these effects, raising questions about their intensity and the
conditions under which they manifest. To address this, we conducted a
comprehensive analysis using relative rather than absolute input lengths,
defined with respect to each model's context window. Our findings reveal that
the LiM effect is strongest when inputs occupy up to 50% of a model's context
window. Beyond that, the primacy bias weakens, while recency bias remains
relatively stable. This effectively eliminates the LiM effect; instead, we
observe a distance-based bias, where model performance is better when relevant
information is closer to the end of the input. Furthermore, our results suggest
that successful retrieval is a prerequisite for reasoning in LLMs, and that the
observed positional biases in reasoning are largely inherited from retrieval.
These insights have implications for long-context tasks, the design of future
LLM benchmarks, and evaluation methodologies for LLMs handling extended inputs.

Motivation: 现有LLM在质量评估任务中因预训练目标和低资源语言限制表现不佳。

Result: ALOPE在多种LLM基QE方法中表现更优，中间层表示更适合跨语言任务。

Conclusion: ALOPE为LLM基QE提供了有效优化框架，并公开模型和代码以促进研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across a wide
range of natural language processing tasks. Quality Estimation (QE) for Machine
Translation (MT), which assesses the quality of a source-target pair without
relying on reference translations, remains a challenging cross-lingual task for
LLMs. The challenges stem from the inherent limitations of existing LLM-based
QE systems, which are pre-trained for causal language modelling rather than
regression-specific tasks, further elevated by the presence of low-resource
languages given pre-training data distribution. This paper introduces ALOPE, an
adaptive layer-optimization framework designed to enhance LLM-based QE by
restructuring Transformer representations through layer-wise adaptation for
improved regression-based prediction. Our framework integrates low-rank
adapters (LoRA) with regression task heads, leveraging selected pre-trained
Transformer layers for improved cross-lingual alignment. In addition to the
layer-specific adaptation, ALOPE introduces two strategies-dynamic weighting,
which adaptively combines representations from multiple layers, and multi-head
regression, which aggregates regression losses from multiple heads for QE. Our
framework shows improvements over various existing LLM-based QE approaches.
Empirical evidence suggests that intermediate Transformer layers in LLMs
provide contextual representations that are more aligned with the cross-lingual
nature of the QE task. We make resultant models and framework code publicly
available for further research, also allowing existing LLM-based MT frameworks
to be scaled with QE capabilities.

Conclusion: 该方法可用于识别特定群体偏见的注意力头，未来可扩展用于去偏见化大型语言模型。

Abstract: Recently, many bias detection methods have been proposed to determine the
level of bias a large language model captures. However, tests to identify which
parts of a large language model are responsible for bias towards specific
groups remain underdeveloped. In this study, we present a method using
topological data analysis to identify which heads in GPT-2 contribute to the
misrepresentation of identity groups present in the StereoSet dataset. We find
that biases for particular categories, such as gender or profession, are
concentrated in attention heads that act as hot spots. The metric we propose
can also be used to determine which heads capture bias for a specific group
within a bias category, and future work could extend this method to help
de-bias large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统频率词云在对话分析中表现不佳，无法有效捕捉语义相关性和参与者观点，研究者需要更快速、可解释的概述工具。

Method: ThemeClouds利用LLM识别语料库中的概念主题，并统计提及每个主题的参与者数量，生成基于提及广度的词云。

Result: 在用户研究中，ThemeClouds比频率词云和主题建模基线（如LDA、BERTopic）更能揭示实际设备问题。

Conclusion: ThemeClouds为定性分析提供了更有效的工具，同时探讨了LLM辅助的透明度、研究者控制权及交互分析的可能性。

Abstract: Word clouds are a common way to summarize qualitative interviews, yet
traditional frequency-based methods often fail in conversational contexts: they
surface filler words, ignore paraphrase, and fragment semantically related
ideas. This limits their usefulness in early-stage analysis, when researchers
need fast, interpretable overviews of what participant actually said. We
introduce ThemeClouds, an open-source visualization tool that uses large
language models (LLMs) to generate thematic, participant-weighted word clouds
from dialogue transcripts. The system prompts an LLM to identify concept-level
themes across a corpus and then counts how many unique participants mention
each topic, yielding a visualization grounded in breadth of mention rather than
raw term frequency. Researchers can customize prompts and visualization
parameters, providing transparency and control. Using interviews from a user
study comparing five recording-device configurations (31 participants; 155
transcripts, Whisper ASR), our approach surfaces more actionable device
concerns than frequency clouds and topic-modeling baselines (e.g., LDA,
BERTopic). We discuss design trade-offs for integrating LLM assistance into
qualitative workflows, implications for interpretability and researcher agency,
and opportunities for interactive analyses such as per-condition contrasts
(``diff clouds'').

Result: 提出了LLMs探索能力的量化指标，分析了熵与性能的关系，并优化了RL性能。

Conclusion: 为RLVR系统的进一步发展提供了理论基础和实证支持。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). Unlike traditional RL approaches, RLVR leverages rule-based
feedback to guide LLMs in generating and refining complex reasoning chains -- a
process critically dependent on effective exploration strategies. While prior
work has demonstrated RLVR's empirical success, the fundamental mechanisms
governing LLMs' exploration behaviors remain underexplored. This technical
report presents a systematic investigation of exploration capacities in RLVR,
covering four main aspects: (1) exploration space shaping, where we develop
quantitative metrics to characterize LLMs' capability boundaries; (2)
entropy-performance exchange, analyzed across training stages, individual
instances, and token-level patterns; and (3) RL performance optimization,
examining methods to effectively translate exploration gains into measurable
improvements. By unifying previously identified insights with new empirical
evidence, this work aims to provide a foundational framework for advancing RLVR
systems.

Motivation: 印度保释决策存在主观性、延迟和不一致，导致监狱人口中75%为未审判囚犯，加剧人权问题和司法积压。

Method: 基于150,430份高等法院保释判决数据集，使用参数高效技术微调大语言模型，结合法定上下文和RAG。

Result: 模型在法定知识支持下表现显著优于基线，准确性和解释质量高，且能泛化到专家标注的测试集。

Conclusion: IBPS为印度司法系统提供了透明、可扩展的解决方案，支持数据驱动的法律辅助，促进程序公平。

Abstract: Bail decisions are among the most frequently adjudicated matters in Indian
courts, yet they remain plagued by subjectivity, delays, and inconsistencies.
With over 75% of India's prison population comprising undertrial prisoners,
many from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, the lack of timely and
fair bail adjudication exacerbates human rights concerns and contributes to
systemic judicial backlog. In this paper, we present the Indian Bail Prediction
System (IBPS), an AI-powered framework designed to assist in bail
decision-making by predicting outcomes and generating legally sound rationales
based solely on factual case attributes and statutory provisions. We curate and
release a large-scale dataset of 150,430 High Court bail judgments, enriched
with structured annotations such as age, health, criminal history, crime
category, custody duration, statutes, and judicial reasoning. We fine-tune a
large language model using parameter-efficient techniques and evaluate its
performance across multiple configurations, with and without statutory context,
and with RAG. Our results demonstrate that models fine-tuned with statutory
knowledge significantly outperform baselines, achieving strong accuracy and
explanation quality, and generalize well to a test set independently annotated

*Ziheng Li,Zhi-Hong Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出KeyCP++方法，通过关键词链式思维提示改进LLM在事件检测中的表现，解决传统ICL的过解释问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在事件检测中因缺乏对事件触发器的准确理解而表现不佳，传统ICL方法无法有效纠正这一问题。

Method: KeyCP++通过自动标注输入文本与检测结果间的逻辑差距，构建触发器判别提示模板，结合关键词生成候选触发器并验证。

Result: 实验证明KeyCP++在单样本事件检测中显著提升性能。

Conclusion: KeyCP++通过提出和验证候选触发器的方法，有效减少LLM对关键词的过度依赖，促进检测规则学习。

Abstract: Although the LLM-based in-context learning (ICL) paradigm has demonstrated
considerable success across various natural language processing tasks, it
encounters challenges in event detection. This is because LLMs lack an accurate
understanding of event triggers and tend to make over-interpretation, which
cannot be effectively corrected through in-context examples alone. In this
paper, we focus on the most challenging one-shot setting and propose KeyCP++, a
keyword-centric chain-of-thought prompting approach. KeyCP++ addresses the
weaknesses of conventional ICL by automatically annotating the logical gaps
between input text and detection results for the demonstrations. Specifically,
to generate in-depth and meaningful rationale, KeyCP++ constructs a trigger
discrimination prompting template. It incorporates the exemplary triggers
(a.k.a keywords) into the prompt as the anchor to simply trigger profiling, let
LLM propose candidate triggers, and justify each candidate. These
propose-and-judge rationales help LLMs mitigate over-reliance on the keywords
and promote detection rule learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, showcasing significant advancements in one-shot
event detection.

*Anirudh Iyengar Kaniyar Narayana Iyengar,Srija Mukhopadhyay,Adnan Qidwai,Shubhankar Singh,Dan Roth,Vivek Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InterChart是一个诊断基准，用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）在多图表推理任务中的表现，涵盖实体推断、趋势关联、数值估计和抽象多步推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注单一图表，而实际应用（如科学报告、金融分析）需要跨多图表推理能力。InterChart填补了这一空白。

Method: 将基准分为三个难度层级：单图表事实推理、合成对齐图表集的综合分析、真实复杂图表对的语义推理。

Result: 评估显示，随着图表复杂度增加，VLMs准确性显著下降。模型在简化视觉单元时表现更好，但跨图表整合能力不足。

Conclusion: InterChart揭示了VLMs在多图表环境中的局限性，为提升多模态推理提供了严谨框架。

Abstract: We introduce InterChart, a diagnostic benchmark that evaluates how well
vision-language models (VLMs) reason across multiple related charts, a task
central to real-world applications such as scientific reporting, financial
analysis, and public policy dashboards. Unlike prior benchmarks focusing on
isolated, visually uniform charts, InterChart challenges models with diverse
question types ranging from entity inference and trend correlation to numerical
estimation and abstract multi-step reasoning grounded in 2-3 thematically or
structurally related charts. We organize the benchmark into three tiers of
increasing difficulty: (1) factual reasoning over individual charts, (2)
integrative analysis across synthetically aligned chart sets, and (3) semantic
inference over visually complex, real-world chart pairs. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art open and closed-source VLMs reveals consistent and steep
accuracy declines as chart complexity increases. We find that models perform
better when we decompose multi-entity charts into simpler visual units,
underscoring their struggles with cross-chart integration. By exposing these
systematic limitations, InterChart provides a rigorous framework for advancing
multimodal reasoning in complex, multi-visual environments.

*Luyao Zhuang,Qinggang Zhang,Huachi Zhou,Juhua Liu,Qing Li,Xiao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LoSemB的逻辑引导语义桥接框架，用于解决大语言模型在工具检索中遇到的未见工具问题，通过逻辑信息挖掘和转移实现高效检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的工具库不断更新，现有方法在未见工具上表现不佳，存在分布偏移和相似性检索脆弱性问题。

Method: 提出LoSemB框架，包含逻辑嵌入对齐模块和关系增强检索机制，以解决分布偏移和检索脆弱性。

Result: 实验表明LoSemB在归纳设置中表现优异，同时在转导设置中保持良好效果。

Conclusion: LoSemB通过逻辑信息挖掘和转移，有效解决了未见工具检索问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Tool learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for large language models
(LLMs) to solve many real-world tasks. Nonetheless, with the tool repository
rapidly expanding, it is impractical to contain all tools within the limited
input length of LLMs. To alleviate these issues, researchers have explored
incorporating a tool retrieval module to select the most relevant tools or
represent tools as unique tokens within LLM parameters. However, most
state-of-the-art methods are under transductive settings, assuming all tools
have been observed during training. Such a setting deviates from reality as the
real-world tool repository is evolving and incorporates new tools frequently.
When dealing with these unseen tools, which refer to tools not encountered
during the training phase, these methods are limited by two key issues,
including the large distribution shift and the vulnerability of
similarity-based retrieval. To this end, inspired by human cognitive processes
of mastering unseen tools through discovering and applying the logical
information from prior experience, we introduce a novel Logic-Guided Semantic
Bridging framework for inductive tool retrieval, namely, LoSemB, which aims to
mine and transfer latent logical information for inductive tool retrieval
without costly retraining. Specifically, LoSemB contains a logic-based
embedding alignment module to mitigate distribution shifts and implements a
relational augmented retrieval mechanism to reduce the vulnerability of
similarity-based retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoSemB
achieves advanced performance in inductive settings while maintaining desirable
effectiveness in the transductive setting.

*Charlie Wyatt,Aditya Joshi,Flora Salim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了基于Transformer的模型在Next Token Prediction (NTP)上的局限性，提出Masked Sentence Prediction (MSP)任务评估模型在长距离连贯性上的表现，发现商业LLMs在低结构化领域表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NTP仅关注单令牌预测，缺乏对长距离连贯性的激励，研究旨在评估LLMs在全局连贯性上的能力。

Method: 评估GPT-4o、Claude 3.5 Sonnet和Gemini 2.0 Flash在MSP任务中的表现，涵盖叙事、程序和说明性文本领域。

Result: 商业LLMs在低结构化领域的MSP任务中表现较差，揭示了模型能力的不足。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在长距离连贯性任务中存在明显缺陷，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Transformer-based models primarily rely on Next Token Prediction (NTP), which
predicts the next token in a sequence based on the preceding context. However,
NTP's focus on single-token prediction often limits a model's ability to plan
ahead or maintain long-range coherence, raising questions about how well LLMs
can predict longer contexts, such as full sentences within structured
documents. While NTP encourages local fluency, it provides no explicit
incentive to ensure global coherence across sentence boundaries-an essential
skill for reconstructive or discursive tasks. To investigate this, we evaluate
three commercial LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) on
Masked Sentence Prediction (MSP) - the task of infilling a randomly removed
sentence - from three domains: ROCStories (narrative), Recipe1M (procedural),
and Wikipedia (expository). We assess both fidelity (similarity to the original
sentence) and cohesiveness (fit within the surrounding context). Our key
finding reveals that commercial LLMs, despite their superlative performance in
other tasks, are poor at predicting masked sentences in low-structured domains,
highlighting a gap in current model capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨社会偏见是否导致大型语言模型（LLMs）的忠实性幻觉，使用结构因果模型（SCM）验证因果关系，并设计偏见干预措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在多任务中表现优异，但其输出可能与输入不一致（忠实性幻觉），社会偏见可能是未探索的诱因。

Method: 利用SCM建立因果关系，设计偏见干预措施，并开发Bias Intervention Dataset（BID）精确测量因果效应。

Result: 实验表明偏见是忠实性幻觉的重要原因，不同偏见状态的影响方向各异。

Conclusion: 偏见对幻觉生成具有微妙但显著的因果影响，尤其在针对社会偏见的不公平幻觉中。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various
tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to faithfulness hallucinations, where the
output does not align with the input. In this study, we investigate whether
social bias contributes to these hallucinations, a causal relationship that has
not been explored. A key challenge is controlling confounders within the
context, which complicates the isolation of causality between bias states and
hallucinations. To address this, we utilize the Structural Causal Model (SCM)
to establish and validate the causality and design bias interventions to
control confounders. In addition, we develop the Bias Intervention Dataset
(BID), which includes various social biases, enabling precise measurement of
causal effects. Experiments on mainstream LLMs reveal that biases are
significant causes of faithfulness hallucinations, and the effect of each bias
state differs in direction. We further analyze the scope of these causal
effects across various models, specifically focusing on unfairness
hallucinations, which are primarily targeted by social bias, revealing the
subtle yet significant causal effect of bias on hallucination generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语法的分块策略，结合依赖关系和标点特征，实现语义完整的输入流分割，并在此基础上开发了SASST框架，显著提升了多语言翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决输入流的分割问题，确保语义连贯性，同时优化同步语音翻译的时机和内容。

Method: 采用语法分块策略，结合Whisper编码器和仅解码器的LLM，动态输出翻译标记或等待符号，解决词序差异。

Result: 在CoVoST2多语言语料库上实验，翻译质量显著提升。

Conclusion: 语法结构在LLM驱动的同步语音翻译系统中具有显著效果。

Abstract: This work proposes a grammar-based chunking strategy that segments input
streams into semantically complete units by parsing dependency relations (e.g.,
noun phrase boundaries, verb-object structures) and punctuation features. The
method ensures chunk coherence and minimizes semantic fragmentation. Building
on this mechanism, we present SASST (Syntax-Aware Simultaneous Speech
Translation), an end-to-end framework integrating frozen Whisper encoder and
decoder-only LLM. The unified architecture dynamically outputs translation
tokens or <WAIT> symbols to jointly optimize translation timing and content,
with target-side reordering addressing word-order divergence. Experiments on
CoVoST2 multilingual corpus En-{De, Zh, Ja} demonstrate significant translation
quality improvements across languages and validate the effectiveness of
syntactic structures in LLM-driven SimulST systems.

TL;DR: Grove MoE是一种新型的MoE架构，通过引入不同大小的专家和动态激活机制，提高了计算效率，并在33B参数的LLM中实现了与SOTA模型相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE架构使用同质化专家，激活固定数量的参数，限制了计算效率。Grove MoE旨在通过异质化专家和动态激活机制解决这一问题。

Method: Grove MoE采用异质化专家（类似big.LITTLE CPU架构）和动态激活机制，开发了GroveMoE-Base和GroveMoE-Inst模型。

Result: GroveMoE模型动态激活3.14-3.28B参数，性能与类似或更大规模的SOTA开源模型相当。

Conclusion: Grove MoE通过异质化专家和动态激活机制，显著提升了计算效率和模型性能。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is a cornerstone of modern
state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language models (LLMs). MoE models facilitate
scalability by enabling sparse parameter activation. However, traditional MoE
architecture uses homogeneous experts of a uniform size, activating a fixed
number of parameters irrespective of input complexity and thus limiting
computational efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Grove MoE,
a novel architecture incorporating experts of varying sizes, inspired by the
heterogeneous big.LITTLE CPU architecture. This architecture features novel
adjugate experts with a dynamic activation mechanism, enabling model capacity
expansion while maintaining manageable computational overhead. Building on this
architecture, we present GroveMoE-Base and GroveMoE-Inst, 33B-parameter LLMs
developed by applying an upcycling strategy to the Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base model
during mid-training and post-training. GroveMoE models dynamically activate
3.14-3.28B parameters based on token complexity and achieve performance
comparable to SOTA open-source models of similar or even larger size.

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过策略性嵌入说服性语言可以偏袒LLM评委对数学推理任务的评分，即使答案错误也能获得更高分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLM评委是否容易被说服性语言影响评分，尤其是在数学推理任务中。

Method: 基于亚里士多德的修辞原则，定义了七种说服技巧，并将其嵌入到数学答案中，测试LLM评委的评分偏差。

Result: 说服性语言导致LLM评委对错误答案评分平均提高8%，且模型规模增大无法显著缓解此问题。

Conclusion: LLM评委易受说服性语言影响，需开发更鲁棒的防御机制。

Abstract: As large language models take on growing roles as automated evaluators in
practical settings, a critical question arises: Can individuals persuade an LLM
judge to assign unfairly high scores? This study is the first to reveal that
strategically embedded persuasive language can bias LLM judges when scoring
mathematical reasoning tasks, where correctness should be independent of
stylistic variation. Grounded in Aristotle's rhetorical principles, we
formalize seven persuasion techniques (Majority, Consistency, Flattery,
Reciprocity, Pity, Authority, Identity) and embed them into otherwise identical
responses. Across six math benchmarks, we find that persuasive language leads
LLM judges to assign inflated scores to incorrect solutions, by up to 8% on
average, with Consistency causing the most severe distortion. Notably,
increasing model size does not substantially mitigate this vulnerability.
Further analysis demonstrates that combining multiple persuasion techniques
amplifies the bias, and pairwise evaluation is likewise susceptible. Moreover,
the persuasive effect persists under counter prompting strategies, highlighting
a critical vulnerability in LLM-as-a-Judge pipelines and underscoring the need
for robust defenses against persuasion-based attacks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补语言学中焦点分析（FA）缺乏定量评估的研究空白，并论证情感分析（SA）的组合规则同样适用于FA。

Method: 利用通用依存关系（UDs）的形式化表示，应用基本句法规则（如修饰、协调和否定）对情感词典中的词汇进行组合分析。

Result: 组合分析方法在SA中表现出更高的可解释性和准确性，优于非组合方法VADER，并将结果推广到FA。

Conclusion: 组合分析方法在SA和FA中均有效，为相关领域提供了新的研究视角和方法。

Abstract: This paper summarizes the results of evaluating a compositional approach for
Focus Analysis (FA) in Linguistics and Sentiment Analysis (SA) in Natural
Language Processing (NLP). While quantitative evaluations of compositional and
non-compositional approaches in SA exist in NLP, similar quantitative
evaluations are very rare in FA in Linguistics that deal with linguistic
expressions representing focus or emphasis such as "it was John who left". We
fill this gap in research by arguing that compositional rules in SA also apply
to FA because FA and SA are closely related meaning that SA is part of FA. Our
compositional approach in SA exploits basic syntactic rules such as rules of
modification, coordination, and negation represented in the formalism of
Universal Dependencies (UDs) in English and applied to words representing
sentiments from sentiment dictionaries. Some of the advantages of our
compositional analysis method for SA in contrast to non-compositional analysis
methods are interpretability and explainability. We test the accuracy of our
compositional approach and compare it with a non-compositional approach VADER
that uses simple heuristic rules to deal with negation, coordination and
modification. In contrast to previous related work that evaluates
compositionality in SA on long reviews, this study uses more appropriate
datasets to evaluate compositionality. In addition, we generalize the results
of compositional approaches in SA to compositional approaches in FA.

Motivation: 文本数据标注成本高且耗时，LLMs在通用NLP任务中表现优异，但在专家知识领域的标注效果尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过单模型和多代理讨论框架评估LLMs，结合推理模型（如o3-mini）进行对比。

Result: （1）单模型在推理技术下表现提升有限；（2）推理模型未显著优于非推理模型；（3）多代理环境中某些模型行为显现。

Conclusion: LLMs在专家知识领域的标注效果有限，多代理方法虽有趣但需进一步优化。

Abstract: Textual data annotation, the process of labeling or tagging text with
relevant information, is typically costly, time-consuming, and labor-intensive.
While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential as direct
alternatives to human annotators for general domains natural language
processing (NLP) tasks, their effectiveness on annotation tasks in domains
requiring expert knowledge remains underexplored. In this paper, we
investigate: whether top-performing LLMs, which might be perceived as having
expert-level proficiency in academic and professional benchmarks, can serve as
direct alternatives to human expert annotators? To this end, we evaluate both
individual LLMs and multi-agent approaches across three highly specialized
domains: finance, biomedicine, and law. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent
discussion framework to simulate a group of human annotators, where LLMs are
tasked to engage in discussions by considering others' annotations and
justifications before finalizing their labels. Additionally, we incorporate
reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) to enable a more comprehensive comparison. Our
empirical results reveal that: (1) Individual LLMs equipped with inference-time
techniques (e.g., chain-of-thought (CoT), self-consistency) show only marginal
or even negative performance gains, contrary to prior literature suggesting
their broad effectiveness. (2) Overall, reasoning models do not demonstrate
statistically significant improvements over non-reasoning models in most
settings. This suggests that extended long CoT provides relatively limited
benefits for data annotation in specialized domains. (3) Certain model
behaviors emerge in the multi-agent discussion environment. For instance,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet with thinking rarely changes its initial annotations, even
when other agents provide correct annotations or valid reasoning.

Result: 法律专用LLM（如Legal-BERT和Contracts-BERT）在需要细致法律理解的任务中表现优于通用模型，且参数量更少。

Conclusion: 研究结果为法律专用LLM提供了全面评估，有助于开发更准确的合同理解系统。

Abstract: Despite advances in legal NLP, no comprehensive evaluation covering multiple
legal-specific LLMs currently exists for contract classification tasks in
contract understanding. To address this gap, we present an evaluation of 10
legal-specific LLMs on three English language contract understanding tasks and
compare them with 7 general-purpose LLMs. The results show that legal-specific
LLMs consistently outperform general-purpose models, especially on tasks
requiring nuanced legal understanding. Legal-BERT and Contracts-BERT establish
new SOTAs on two of the three tasks, despite having 69% fewer parameters than
the best-performing general-purpose LLM. We also identify CaseLaw-BERT and
LexLM as strong additional baselines for contract understanding. Our results
provide a holistic evaluation of legal-specific LLMs and will facilitate the
development of more accurate contract understanding systems.

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained sentiment analysis
task that aims to identify sentiment toward specific aspects of an entity.
While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in various

remain largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation
of 19 LLMs of varying sizes and architectures on Czech ABSA, comparing their
performance in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios. Our results show
that small domain-specific models fine-tuned for ABSA outperform
general-purpose LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings, while fine-tuned LLMs
achieve state-of-the-art results. We analyze how factors such as
multilingualism, model size, and recency influence performance and present an
error analysis highlighting key challenges, particularly in aspect term
prediction. Our findings provide insights into the suitability of LLMs for
Czech ABSA and offer guidance for future research in this area.

Conclusion: 少量高质量目标语言示例对跨语言ABSA任务具有显著实用价值，尤其在低资源和领域特定场景中。

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has received substantial attention in
English, yet challenges remain for low-resource languages due to the scarcity
of labelled data. Current cross-lingual ABSA approaches often rely on external
translation tools and overlook the potential benefits of incorporating a small
number of target language examples into training. In this paper, we evaluate
the effect of adding few-shot target language examples to the training set
across four ABSA tasks, six target languages, and two sequence-to-sequence
models. We show that adding as few as ten target language examples
significantly improves performance over zero-shot settings and achieves a
similar effect to constrained decoding in reducing prediction errors.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that combining 1,000 target language examples with
English data can even surpass monolingual baselines. These findings offer
practical insights for improving cross-lingual ABSA in low-resource and
domain-specific settings, as obtaining ten high-quality annotated examples is
both feasible and highly effective.

Conclusion: 双参数表示法为手语虚拟角色的情感表达提供了一种更直观和一致的方法。

Abstract: Non-manual signals in sign languages continue to be a challenge for signing
avatars. More specifically, emotional content has been difficult to incorporate
because of a lack of a standard method of specifying the avatar's emotional
state. This paper explores the application of an intuitive two-parameter
representation for emotive non-manual signals to the Paula signing avatar that
shows promise for facilitating the linguistic specification of emotional facial
expressions in a more coherent manner than previous methods. Users can apply
these parameters to control Paula's emotional expressions through a textual
representation called the EASIER notation. The representation can allow avatars
to express more nuanced emotional states using two numerical parameters. It
also has the potential to enable more consistent specification of emotional
non-manual signals in linguistic annotations which drive signing avatars.

Abstract: Expert domain writing, such as scientific writing, typically demands
extensive domain knowledge. Recent advances in LLMs show promising potential in
reducing the expert workload. However, evaluating the quality of automatically
generated scientific writing is a crucial open issue, as it requires knowledge
of domain-specific evaluation criteria and the ability to discern expert
preferences. Conventional automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge systems are
insufficient to grasp expert preferences and domain-specific quality standards.
To address this gap and support human-AI collaborative writing, we focus on
related work generation, one of the most challenging scientific tasks, as an
exemplar. We propose GREP, a multi-turn evaluation framework that integrates
classical related work evaluation criteria with expert-specific preferences.
Instead of assigning a single score, our framework decomposes the evaluation
into fine-grained dimensions. This localized evaluation approach is further
augmented with contrastive few-shot examples to provide detailed contextual
guidance for the evaluation dimensions. The design principles allow our
framework to deliver cardinal assessment of quality, which can facilitate
better post-training compared to ordinal preference data. For better
accessibility, we design two variants of GREP: a more precise variant with
proprietary LLMs as evaluators, and a cheaper alternative with open-weight
LLMs. Empirical investigation reveals that our framework is able to assess the
quality of related work sections in a much more robust manner compared to
standard LLM judges, reflects natural scenarios of scientific writing, and
bears a strong correlation with the human expert assessment. We also observe
that generations from state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to satisfy validation
constraints of a suitable related work section. They (mostly) fail to improve
based on feedback as well.

Abstract: Subjective language understanding refers to a broad set of natural language
processing tasks where the goal is to interpret or generate content that
conveys personal feelings, opinions, or figurative meanings rather than
objective facts. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) such as
ChatGPT, LLaMA, and others, there has been a paradigm shift in how we approach
these inherently nuanced tasks. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive
review of recent advances in applying LLMs to subjective language tasks,
including sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, sarcasm detection, humor
understanding, stance detection, metaphor interpretation, intent detection, and
aesthetics assessment. We begin by clarifying the definition of subjective
language from linguistic and cognitive perspectives, and we outline the unique
challenges posed by subjective language (e.g. ambiguity, figurativeness,
context dependence). We then survey the evolution of LLM architectures and
techniques that particularly benefit subjectivity tasks, highlighting why LLMs
are well-suited to model subtle human-like judgments. For each of the eight
tasks, we summarize task definitions, key datasets, state-of-the-art LLM-based
methods, and remaining challenges. We provide comparative insights, discussing
commonalities and differences among tasks and how multi-task LLM approaches
might yield unified models of subjectivity. Finally, we identify open issues
such as data limitations, model bias, and ethical considerations, and suggest
future research directions. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable
resource for researchers and practitioners interested in the intersection of
affective computing, figurative language processing, and large-scale language
models.

Abstract: Current speech translation systems, while having achieved impressive
accuracies, are rather static in their behavior and do not adapt to real-world
situations in ways human interpreters do. In order to improve their practical
usefulness and enable interpreting-like experiences, a precise understanding of
the nature of human interpreting is crucial. To this end, we discuss human
interpreting literature from the perspective of the machine translation field,
while considering both operational and qualitative aspects. We identify
implications for the development of speech translation systems and argue that
there is great potential to adopt many human interpreting principles using
recent modeling techniques. We hope that our findings provide inspiration for
closing the perceived usability gap, and can motivate progress toward true
machine interpreting.

Motivation: 评估不同SiLM架构在诱导句法表示、语法判断任务和训练动态方面的表现，填补现有研究的系统性空白。

Method: 比较三种SiLM架构（Structformer、UDGN、GPST）在自然语言和合成数据上的表现，分析其句法表示、语法判断能力和训练动态。

Result: GPST在多项评估中表现最稳定，尤其在长距离依赖任务中优于其他模型。小模型在大量合成数据上训练可作为有效测试平台。

Conclusion: 不同SiLM架构各有优劣，GPST表现最稳定，合成数据训练的小模型有助于基础模型评估。

Abstract: Structure-inducing Language Models (SiLM) are trained on a self-supervised
language modeling task, and induce a hierarchical sentence representation as a
byproduct when processing an input. A wide variety of SiLMs have been proposed.
However, these have typically been evaluated on a relatively small scale, and
evaluation of these models has systematic gaps and lacks comparability. In this
work, we study three different SiLM architectures using both natural language
(English) corpora and synthetic bracketing expressions: Structformer (Shen et
al., 2021), UDGN (Shen et al., 2022) and GPST (Hu et al., 2024). We compare
them with respect to (i) properties of the induced syntactic representations
(ii) performance on grammaticality judgment tasks, and (iii) training dynamics.
We find that none of the three architectures dominates across all evaluation
metrics. However, there are significant differences, in particular with respect
to the induced syntactic representations. The Generative Pretrained Structured
Transformer (GPST; Hu et al. 2024) performs most consistently across evaluation
settings, and outperforms the other models on long-distance dependencies in
bracketing expressions. Furthermore, our study shows that small models trained
on large amounts of synthetic data provide a useful testbed for evaluating
basic model properties.

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLM-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in handling complex, knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating
external tools. Among diverse choices of tools, search tools play a pivotal
role in accessing vast external knowledge. However, open-source agents still
fall short of achieving expert-level Search Intelligence, the ability to
resolve ambiguous queries, generate precise searches, analyze results, and
conduct thorough exploration. Existing approaches fall short in scalability,
efficiency, and data quality. For example, small turn limits in existing online
RL methods, e.g. <=10, restrict complex strategy learning. This paper
introduces ASearcher, an open-source project for large-scale RL training of
search agents. Our key contributions include: (1) Scalable fully asynchronous
RL training that enables long-horizon search while maintaining high training
efficiency. (2) A prompt-based LLM agent that autonomously synthesizes
high-quality and challenging QAs, creating a large-scale QA dataset. Through RL
training, our prompt-based QwQ-32B agent achieves substantial improvements,
with 46.7% and 20.8% Avg@4 gains on xBench and GAIA, respectively. Notably, our
agent exhibits extreme long-horizon search, with tool calls exceeding 40 turns
and output tokens exceeding 150k during training time. With a simple agent
design and no external LLMs, ASearcher-Web-QwQ achieves Avg@4 scores of 42.1 on
xBench and 52.8 on GAIA, surpassing existing open-source 32B agents. We
open-source our models, training data, and codes in

Abstract: Metaphor is a fundamental cognitive mechanism that shapes scientific
understanding, enabling the communication of complex concepts while potentially
constraining paradigmatic thinking. Despite the prevalence of figurative
language in scientific discourse, existing metaphor detection resources
primarily focus on general-domain text, leaving a critical gap for
domain-specific applications. In this paper, we present the Medical Metaphors
Corpus (MCC), a comprehensive dataset of 792 annotated scientific conceptual
metaphors spanning medical and biological domains. MCC aggregates metaphorical
expressions from diverse sources including peer-reviewed literature, news
media, social media discourse, and crowdsourced contributions, providing both
binary and graded metaphoricity judgments validated through human annotation.
Each instance includes source-target conceptual mappings and perceived
metaphoricity scores on a 0-7 scale, establishing the first annotated resource
for computational scientific metaphor research. Our evaluation demonstrates
that state-of-the-art language models achieve modest performance on scientific
metaphor detection, revealing substantial room for improvement in
domain-specific figurative language understanding. MCC enables multiple
research applications including metaphor detection benchmarking, quality-aware
generation systems, and patient-centered communication tools.

Method: 提出WideSearch基准，包含200个多领域问题，通过五阶段质量控制确保数据集质量，并评估10种搜索代理系统。

Result: 现有代理系统成功率极低（最高5%），而人类测试者可接近100%，显示代理在大规模信息收集中的不足。

Conclusion: 当前搜索代理在大规模信息收集中存在严重缺陷，需进一步研究改进，WideSearch为未来研究提供了基准。

Abstract: From professional research to everyday planning, many tasks are bottlenecked
by wide-scale information seeking, which is more repetitive than cognitively
complex. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), automated
search agents powered by LLMs offer a promising solution to liberate humans
from this tedious work. However, the capability of these agents to perform such
"wide-context" collection reliably and completely remains largely unevaluated
due to a lack of suitable benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce
WideSearch, a new benchmark engineered to evaluate agent reliability on these
large-scale collection tasks. The benchmark features 200 manually curated
questions (100 in English, 100 in Chinese) from over 15 diverse domains,
grounded in real user queries. Each task requires agents to collect large-scale
atomic information, which could be verified one by one objectively, and arrange
it into a well-organized output. A rigorous five-stage quality control pipeline
ensures the difficulty, completeness, and verifiability of the dataset. We
benchmark over 10 state-of-the-art agentic search systems, including
single-agent, multi-agent frameworks, and end-to-end commercial systems. Most
systems achieve overall success rates near 0\%, with the best performer
reaching just 5\%. However, given sufficient time, cross-validation by multiple
human testers can achieve a near 100\% success rate. These results demonstrate
that present search agents have critical deficiencies in large-scale
information seeking, underscoring urgent areas for future research and
development in agentic search. Our dataset, evaluation pipeline, and benchmark
results have been publicly released at https://widesearch-seed.github.io/

Motivation: 现有方法在扩展大语言模型深度时忽略神经元排列差异，可能导致性能下降。

Method: 通过最优传输对齐和融合相邻基础层的Transformer块，创建新层以减少神经元排列不匹配。

Result: OpT-DeUS在持续预训练和监督微调中表现优于现有方法，且插入新层靠近顶部时训练效率更高。

Conclusion: OpT-DeUS通过OT解决神经元排列问题，显著提升模型扩展的效率和性能。

Abstract: Scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) yields performance gains but incurs
substantial training costs. Depth up-scaling offers training efficiency by
adding new layers to pre-trained models. However, most existing methods copy or
average weights from base layers, neglecting neuron permutation differences.
This limitation can potentially cause misalignment that harms performance.
Inspired by applying Optimal Transport (OT) for neuron alignment, we propose
Optimal Transport Depth Up-Scaling (OpT-DeUS). OpT-DeUS aligns and fuses
Transformer blocks in adjacent base layers via OT for new layer creation, to
mitigate neuron permutation mismatch between layers. OpT-DeUS achieves better
overall performance and offers improved training efficiency than existing
methods for continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning across different
model sizes. To further evaluate the impact of interpolation positions, our
extensive analysis shows that inserting new layers closer to the top results in
higher training efficiency due to shorter back-propagation time while obtaining
additional performance gains.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结构化表示和高效训练策略，提升了SLM在副语言和上下文理解上的能力。

Abstract: Conversational systems relying on text-based large language models (LLMs)
often overlook paralinguistic cues, essential for understanding emotions and
intentions. Speech-language models (SLMs), which use speech as input, are
emerging as a promising solution. However, SLMs built by extending frozen LLMs
struggle to capture paralinguistic information and exhibit reduced context
understanding. We identify entangled information and improper training
strategies as key issues. To address these issues, we propose two heterogeneous
adapters and suggest a weakly supervised training strategy. Our approach
disentangles paralinguistic and linguistic information, enabling SLMs to
interpret speech through structured representations. It also preserves
contextual understanding by avoiding the generation of task-specific vectors
through controlled randomness. This approach trains only the adapters on common
datasets, ensuring parameter and data efficiency. Experiments demonstrate
competitive performance in emotional conversation tasks, showcasing the model's
ability to effectively integrate both paralinguistic and linguistic information
within contextual settings.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their increased
accessibility have made it easier than ever for students to automatically
generate texts, posing new challenges for educational institutions. To enforce
norms of academic integrity and ensure students' learning, learning analytics
methods to automatically detect LLM-generated text appear increasingly
appealing. This paper benchmarks the performance of different state-of-the-art
detectors in educational contexts, introducing a novel dataset, called
Generative Essay Detection in Education (GEDE), containing over 900
student-written essays and over 12,500 LLM-generated essays from various
domains. To capture the diversity of LLM usage practices in generating text, we
propose the concept of contribution levels, representing students' contribution
to a given assignment. These levels range from purely human-written texts, to
slightly LLM-improved versions, to fully LLM-generated texts, and finally to
active attacks on the detector by "humanizing" generated texts. We show that
most detectors struggle to accurately classify texts of intermediate student
contribution levels, like LLM-improved human-written texts. Detectors are
particularly likely to produce false positives, which is problematic in
educational settings where false suspicions can severely impact students'
lives. Our dataset, code, and additional supplementary materials are publicly

Conclusion: 建议未来研究探索迭代细化在编码语言信息中的有效性原因。

Abstract: Self-supervised models for speech representation learning now see widespread
use for their versatility and performance on downstream tasks, but the effect
of model architecture on the linguistic information learned in their
representations remains under-studied. This study investigates two such models,
HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0, and minimally compares two of their architectural
differences: training objective and iterative pseudo-label refinement through
multiple training iterations. We find that differences in canonical correlation
of hidden representations to word identity, phoneme identity, and speaker
identity are explained by training iteration, not training objective. We
suggest that future work investigate the reason for the effectiveness of
iterative refinement in encoding linguistic information in self-supervised
speech representations.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel Czech dataset for aspect-based sentiment
analysis (ABSA), which consists of 3.1K manually annotated reviews from the
restaurant domain. The dataset is built upon the older Czech dataset, which
contained only separate labels for the basic ABSA tasks such as aspect term
extraction or aspect polarity detection. Unlike its predecessor, our new
dataset is specifically designed for more complex tasks, e.g.
target-aspect-category detection. These advanced tasks require a unified
annotation format, seamlessly linking sentiment elements (labels) together. Our
dataset follows the format of the well-known SemEval-2016 datasets. This design
choice allows effortless application and evaluation in cross-lingual scenarios,
ultimately fostering cross-language comparisons with equivalent counterpart
datasets in other languages. The annotation process engaged two trained
annotators, yielding an impressive inter-annotator agreement rate of
approximately 90%. Additionally, we provide 24M reviews without annotations
suitable for unsupervised learning. We present robust monolingual baseline
results achieved with various Transformer-based models and insightful error
analysis to supplement our contributions. Our code and dataset are freely

Motivation: 现有的语音语言模型（SLMs）在处理语音输入时，难以泛化到不同数据集，可能因为语音与文本表示之间存在模态差距。

Method: 采用最优传输正则化（OTReg），将语音与文本对齐问题建模为最优传输问题，并通过正则化损失优化SLM训练。

Result: 实验表明，OTReg能有效提升语音与文本的对齐效果，缩小模态差距，并增强SLMs在多语言ASR任务中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: OTReg是一种轻量级方法，无需额外标签或参数，可无缝集成到现有SLM训练中，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Spoken Language Models (SLMs), which extend Large Language Models (LLMs) to
perceive speech inputs, have gained increasing attention for their potential to
advance speech understanding tasks. However, despite recent progress, studies
show that SLMs often struggle to generalize across datasets, even for trained
languages and tasks, raising concerns about whether they process speech in a
text-like manner as intended. A key challenge underlying this limitation is the
modality gap between speech and text representations. The high variability in
speech embeddings may allow SLMs to achieve strong in-domain performance by
exploiting unintended speech variations, ultimately hindering generalization.
To mitigate this modality gap, we introduce Optimal Transport Regularization
(OTReg), a method that formulates speech-text alignment as an optimal transport
problem and derives a regularization loss to improve SLM training. In each
training iteration, OTReg first establishes a structured correspondence between
speech and transcript embeddings by determining the optimal transport plan,
then incorporates the regularization loss based on this transport plan to
optimize SLMs in generating speech embeddings that align more effectively with
transcript embeddings. OTReg is lightweight, requiring no additional labels or
learnable parameters, and integrates seamlessly into existing SLM training
procedures. Extensive multilingual ASR experiments demonstrate that OTReg
enhances speech-text alignment, mitigates the modality gap, and consequently
improves SLM generalization across diverse datasets.

Motivation: LLMs在多轮或代理应用中容易生成流畅但不正确的内容（即虚构），这增加了风险。研究旨在探索上下文信息如何影响模型行为，以及LLMs是否能识别其不可靠响应。

Method: 提出了一种可靠性估计方法，通过计算输出logits的偶然性和认知不确定性，识别关键标记，并将其隐藏状态聚合为紧凑表示，用于响应级可靠性预测。

Result: 实验发现，正确的上下文信息提高了答案准确性和模型信心，而误导性上下文常导致模型自信地生成错误答案，揭示了不确定性与正确性之间的不匹配。提出的方法改进了对不可靠输出的检测。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了直接不确定性信号的局限性，并强调了不确定性引导探测在可靠性感知生成中的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating fluent but incorrect
content, known as confabulation, which poses increasing risks in multi-turn or
agentic applications where outputs may be reused as context. In this work, we
investigate how in-context information influences model behavior and whether
LLMs can identify their unreliable responses. We propose a reliability
estimation that leverages token-level uncertainty to guide the aggregation of
internal model representations. Specifically, we compute aleatoric and
epistemic uncertainty from output logits to identify salient tokens and
aggregate their hidden states into compact representations for response-level
reliability prediction. Through controlled experiments on open QA benchmarks,
we find that correct in-context information improves both answer accuracy and
model confidence, while misleading context often induces confidently incorrect
responses, revealing a misalignment between uncertainty and correctness. Our
probing-based method captures these shifts in model behavior and improves the
detection of unreliable outputs across multiple open-source LLMs. These results
underscore the limitations of direct uncertainty signals and highlight the
potential of uncertainty-guided probing for reliability-aware generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生物医学NLP任务中优先考虑示例的代表性而忽视多样性，导致性能受限。

Method: 采用两阶段检索和排序：先优化候选示例的多样性和代表性，再根据测试查询选择最相关且非冗余的示例。

Result: 在三个生物医学NLP任务中，Dual-Div比基线方法性能提升高达5%的macro-F1分数，且对提示变化和类别不平衡具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 初始检索阶段的多样性比排序阶段优化更重要，且3-5个示例能最大化性能效率。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has leveraged their
in-context learning (ICL) abilities to enable quick adaptation to unseen
biomedical NLP tasks. By incorporating only a few input-output examples into
prompts, LLMs can rapidly perform these new tasks. While the impact of these
demonstrations on LLM performance has been extensively studied, most existing
approaches prioritize representativeness over diversity when selecting examples
from large corpora. To address this gap, we propose Dual-Div, a
diversity-enhanced data-efficient framework for demonstration selection in
biomedical ICL. Dual-Div employs a two-stage retrieval and ranking process:
First, it identifies a limited set of candidate examples from a corpus by
optimizing both representativeness and diversity (with optional annotation for
unlabeled data). Second, it ranks these candidates against test queries to
select the most relevant and non-redundant demonstrations. Evaluated on three
biomedical NLP tasks (named entity recognition (NER), relation extraction (RE),
and text classification (TC)) using LLaMA 3.1 and Qwen 2.5 for inference, along
with three retrievers (BGE-Large, BMRetriever, MedCPT), Dual-Div consistently
outperforms baselines-achieving up to 5% higher macro-F1 scores-while
demonstrating robustness to prompt permutations and class imbalance. Our
findings establish that diversity in initial retrieval is more critical than
ranking-stage optimization, and limiting demonstrations to 3-5 examples
maximizes performance efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出REX-RAG框架，通过混合采样策略和政策修正机制解决LLMs在强化学习中陷入无效推理路径的问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在强化学习中容易陷入无效推理路径（dead ends），导致决策不准确，影响策略优化。

Method: 提出REX-RAG框架，结合混合采样策略（探索新路径）和政策修正机制（修正分布偏移）。

Result: 在七个问答基准测试中，REX-RAG平均性能提升5.1%（Qwen2.5-3B）和3.6%（Qwen2.5-7B）。

Conclusion: REX-RAG有效解决了LLMs在强化学习中的推理路径问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a powerful paradigm for enabling
large language models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning tasks. Recent
advances indicate that integrating RL with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
allows LLMs to dynamically incorporate external knowledge, leading to more
informed and robust decision making. However, we identify a critical challenge
during policy-driven trajectory sampling: LLMs are frequently trapped in
unproductive reasoning paths, which we refer to as "dead ends", committing to
overconfident yet incorrect conclusions. This severely hampers exploration and
undermines effective policy optimization. To address this challenge, we propose
REX-RAG (Reasoning Exploration with Policy Correction in Retrieval-Augmented
Generation), a novel framework that explores alternative reasoning paths while
maintaining rigorous policy learning through principled distributional
corrections. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) Mixed Sampling
Strategy, which combines a novel probe sampling method with exploratory prompts
to escape dead ends; and (2) Policy Correction Mechanism, which employs
importance sampling to correct distribution shifts induced by mixed sampling,
thereby mitigating gradient estimation bias. We evaluate it on seven
question-answering benchmarks, and the experimental results show that REX-RAG
achieves average performance gains of 5.1% on Qwen2.5-3B and 3.6% on Qwen2.5-7B
over strong baselines, demonstrating competitive results across multiple
datasets. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/MiliLab/REX-RAG.

demonstrate substantial improvements in both soft and perspectivist evaluation
metrics across three datasets. We also conduct in-depth error and calibration
analyses, highlighting the conditions under which improvements occur. Our
findings underscore the value of disagreement-aware modeling and offer insights
into how system components interact with the complexity of human-annotated

Method: 详细介绍了训练和推理优化技术，包括EAGLE-based推测解码的实现。

Result: 在8个NVIDIA H100 GPU上，Llama4 Maverick的推理延迟达到每token约4毫秒，比之前最佳方法快10%；在大批量生产规模下，速度提升1.4x至2.0x。

Conclusion: 通过优化技术，实现了Llama模型在生产规模下的最新推理速度，为推测解码提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a standard method for accelerating the inference
speed of large language models. However, scaling it for production environments
poses several engineering challenges, including efficiently implementing
different operations (e.g., tree attention and multi-round speculative
decoding) on GPU. In this paper, we detail the training and inference
optimization techniques that we have implemented to enable EAGLE-based
speculative decoding at a production scale for Llama models. With these
changes, we achieve a new state-of-the-art inference latency for Llama models.
For example, Llama4 Maverick decodes at a speed of about 4 ms per token (with a
batch size of one) on 8 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, which is 10% faster than the
previously best known method. Furthermore, for EAGLE-based speculative
decoding, our optimizations enable us to achieve a speed-up for large batch
sizes between 1.4x and 2.0x at production scale.

Motivation: 当前研究多关注模型校准，但较少评估模型不确定性与人类不确定性的对齐程度，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用既有指标和新变体评估推理时不确定性度量，分析其与人类群体不确定性和传统模型校准的对齐情况。

Result: 发现部分度量方法与人类不确定性高度一致，且在校正相关性和分布分析中表现出中等到强的校准效果。

Conclusion: 部分不确定性度量方法能有效对齐人类不确定性，且模型校准效果良好，为改进LLM用户体验提供了实用信号。

Abstract: There has been much recent interest in evaluating large language models for
uncertainty calibration to facilitate model control and modulate user trust.
Inference time uncertainty, which may provide a real-time signal to the model
or external control modules, is particularly important for applying these
concepts to improve LLM-user experience in practice. While many of the existing
papers consider model calibration, comparatively little work has sought to
evaluate how closely model uncertainty aligns to human uncertainty. In this
work, we evaluate a collection of inference-time uncertainty measures, using
both established metrics and novel variations, to determine how closely they
align with both human group-level uncertainty and traditional notions of model
calibration. We find that numerous measures show evidence of strong alignment
to human uncertainty, even despite the lack of alignment to human answer
preference. For those successful metrics, we find moderate to strong evidence
of model calibration in terms of both correctness correlation and
distributional analysis.

<details>

Motivation: 现有水印方法会降低文本质量且依赖白盒模型访问，限制了API模型和多语言场景的应用。

Method: 利用生成文本的确定性特征进行拒绝采样，选择符合密钥目标特征的输出，保持文本质量。

Result: 在4个数据集上实验显示，SAEMark在英语中F1达99.7%，多比特检测准确率高。

Conclusion: SAEMark为闭源LLM提供了一种可扩展的水印范式，支持内容归属。

Abstract: Watermarking LLM-generated text is critical for content attribution and
misinformation prevention. However, existing methods compromise text quality,
require white-box model access and logit manipulation. These limitations
exclude API-based models and multilingual scenarios. We propose SAEMark, a
general framework for post-hoc multi-bit watermarking that embeds personalized
messages solely via inference-time, feature-based rejection sampling without
altering model logits or requiring training. Our approach operates on
deterministic features extracted from generated text, selecting outputs whose
feature statistics align with key-derived targets. This framework naturally
generalizes across languages and domains while preserving text quality through
sampling LLM outputs instead of modifying. We provide theoretical guarantees
relating watermark success probability and compute budget that hold for any
suitable feature extractor. Empirically, we demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), achieving superior detection
accuracy and text quality. Experiments across 4 datasets show SAEMark's
consistent performance, with 99.7% F1 on English and strong multi-bit detection
accuracy. SAEMark establishes a new paradigm for scalable watermarking that
works out-of-the-box with closed-source LLMs while enabling content
attribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（如GPT-5）在复杂医疗决策中的零样本推理能力，尤其是多模态信息的整合。

Method: 通过标准化测试（如MedQA、MedXpertQA等）评估GPT-5及其变体在文本和多模态问答任务中的表现。

Result: GPT-5在所有基准测试中表现最佳，尤其在多模态推理中显著优于GPT-4o和人类专家。

Conclusion: GPT-5在医疗决策支持中展现出超越人类专家的潜力，为未来临床系统设计提供参考。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled general-purpose
systems to perform increasingly complex domain-specific reasoning without
extensive fine-tuning. In the medical domain, decision-making often requires
integrating heterogeneous information sources, including patient narratives,
structured data, and medical images. This study positions GPT-5 as a generalist
multimodal reasoner for medical decision support and systematically evaluates
its zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning performance on both text-based
question answering and visual question answering tasks under a unified
protocol. We benchmark GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano, and GPT-4o-2024-11-20
against standardized splits of MedQA, MedXpertQA (text and multimodal), MMLU
medical subsets, USMLE self-assessment exams, and VQA-RAD. Results show that
GPT-5 consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving state-of-the-art
accuracy across all QA benchmarks and delivering substantial gains in
multimodal reasoning. On MedXpertQA MM, GPT-5 improves reasoning and
understanding scores by +29.62% and +36.18% over GPT-4o, respectively, and
surpasses pre-licensed human experts by +24.23% in reasoning and +29.40% in
understanding. In contrast, GPT-4o remains below human expert performance in
most dimensions. A representative case study demonstrates GPT-5's ability to
integrate visual and textual cues into a coherent diagnostic reasoning chain,
recommending appropriate high-stakes interventions. Our results show that, on
these controlled multimodal reasoning benchmarks, GPT-5 moves from
human-comparable to above human-expert performance. This improvement may
substantially inform the design of future clinical decision-support systems.

Method: 采用基于提示的LLM-as-Judge方法，结合专家定义的心理干预原则推理链进行上下文评估，并使用二元点状评分增强可解释性。

Result: 在3600次评估中，该方法与专家评估一致性最高，且评估理由更易解释。

Conclusion: PsyCrisis-Bench及其数据集和工具公开可用，以推动进一步研究。

Abstract: Evaluating the safety alignment of LLM responses in high-risk mental health
dialogues is particularly difficult due to missing gold-standard answers and
the ethically sensitive nature of these interactions. To address this
challenge, we propose PsyCrisis-Bench, a reference-free evaluation benchmark
based on real-world Chinese mental health dialogues. It evaluates whether the
model responses align with the safety principles defined by experts.
Specifically designed for settings without standard references, our method
adopts a prompt-based LLM-as-Judge approach that conducts in-context evaluation
using expert-defined reasoning chains grounded in psychological intervention
principles. We employ binary point-wise scoring across multiple safety
dimensions to enhance the explainability and traceability of the evaluation.
Additionally, we present a manually curated, high-quality Chinese-language
dataset covering self-harm, suicidal ideation, and existential distress,
derived from real-world online discourse. Experiments on 3600 judgments show
that our method achieves the highest agreement with expert assessments and
produces more interpretable evaluation rationales compared to existing
approaches. Our dataset and evaluation tool are publicly available to
facilitate further research.

Abstract: Unlimited, or so-called helpful-only language models are trained without
safety alignment constraints and never refuse user queries. They are widely
used by leading AI companies as internal tools for red teaming and alignment
evaluation. For example, if a safety-aligned model produces harmful outputs
similar to an unlimited model, this indicates alignment failures that require
further attention. Despite their essential role in assessing alignment, such
models are not available to the research community.
  We introduce Jinx, a helpful-only variant of popular open-weight LLMs. Jinx
responds to all queries without refusals or safety filtering, while preserving
the base model's capabilities in reasoning and instruction following. It
provides researchers with an accessible tool for probing alignment failures,
evaluating safety boundaries, and systematically studying failure modes in
language model safety.

Conclusion: BIND和Med-GRIM为医学VQA提供了高效、精确的解决方案，并推动零样本研究的发展。

Abstract: An ensemble of trained multimodal encoders and vision-language models (VLMs)
has become a standard approach for visual question answering (VQA) tasks.
However, such models often fail to produce responses with the detailed
precision necessary for complex, domain-specific applications such as medical
VQA. Our representation model, BIND: BLIVA Integrated with Dense Encoding,
extends prior multimodal work by refining the joint embedding space through
dense, query-token-based encodings inspired by contrastive pretraining
techniques. This refined encoder powers Med-GRIM, a model designed for medical
VQA tasks that leverages graph-based retrieval and prompt engineering to
integrate domain-specific knowledge. Rather than relying on compute-heavy
fine-tuning of vision and language models on specific datasets, Med-GRIM
applies a low-compute, modular workflow with small language models (SLMs) for
efficiency. Med-GRIM employs prompt-based retrieval to dynamically inject
relevant knowledge, ensuring both accuracy and robustness in its responses. By
assigning distinct roles to each agent within the VQA system, Med-GRIM achieves
large language model performance at a fraction of the computational cost.
Additionally, to support scalable research in zero-shot multimodal medical
applications, we introduce DermaGraph, a novel Graph-RAG dataset comprising
diverse dermatological conditions. This dataset facilitates both multimodal and
unimodal querying. The code and dataset are available at:

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注唇同步或静态情感转换，忽略了动态风格（如头部运动），且双U-Net架构计算开销大。

Method: 设计了Style-Emotion Encoding Module分离风格和情感特征，Audio-Style Fusion Module通过并行交叉注意力层解耦音频和风格，并优化约束以提升唇同步和细节保留。

Result: 实验表明DiTalker在唇同步和说话风格可控性上表现优越。

Conclusion: DiTalker通过统一框架解决了动态风格和计算效率问题，提升了肖像动画的质量和可控性。

Abstract: Portrait animation aims to synthesize talking videos from a static reference
face, conditioned on audio and style frame cues (e.g., emotion and head poses),
while ensuring precise lip synchronization and faithful reproduction of
speaking styles. Existing diffusion-based portrait animation methods primarily
focus on lip synchronization or static emotion transformation, often
overlooking dynamic styles such as head movements. Moreover, most of these
methods rely on a dual U-Net architecture, which preserves identity consistency
but incurs additional computational overhead. To this end, we propose DiTalker,
a unified DiT-based framework for speaking style-controllable portrait
animation. We design a Style-Emotion Encoding Module that employs two separate
branches: a style branch extracting identity-specific style information (e.g.,
head poses and movements), and an emotion branch extracting identity-agnostic
emotion features. We further introduce an Audio-Style Fusion Module that
decouples audio and speaking styles via two parallel cross-attention layers,
using these features to guide the animation process. To enhance the quality of
results, we adopt and modify two optimization constraints: one to improve lip
synchronization and the other to preserve fine-grained identity and background
details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DiTalker in terms
of lip synchronization and speaking style controllability. Project Page:

Motivation: 社交媒体难以检测伪装成健身内容的肌肉畸形行为宣传，传统文本检测方法效果有限。

Method: 开发BigTokDetect框架，利用专家标注的多模态数据集BigTok，结合视觉语言模型进行检测。

Result: 多模态融合提升检测准确率5-10%，视频特征最具区分性，分类准确率达82.9%。

Conclusion: 研究为心理健康领域的有害内容检测提供了新工具和方法框架。

Abstract: Social media platforms increasingly struggle to detect harmful content that
promotes muscle dysmorphic behaviors, particularly pro-bigorexia content that
disproportionately affects adolescent males. Unlike traditional eating disorder
detection focused on the "thin ideal," pro-bigorexia material masquerades as
legitimate fitness content through complex multimodal combinations of visual
displays, coded language, and motivational messaging that evade text-based
detection systems. We address this challenge by developing BigTokDetect, a
clinically-informed detection framework for identifying pro-bigorexia content
on TikTok. We introduce BigTok, the first expert-annotated multimodal dataset
of over 2,200 TikTok videos labeled by clinical psychologists and psychiatrists
across five primary categories spanning body image, nutrition, exercise,
supplements, and masculinity. Through a comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art vision language models, we achieve 0.829% accuracy on primary
category classification and 0.690% on subcategory detection via domain-specific
finetuning. Our ablation studies demonstrate that multimodal fusion improves
performance by 5-10% over text-only approaches, with video features providing
the most discriminative signals. These findings establish new benchmarks for
multimodal harmful content detection and provide both the computational tools
and methodological framework needed for scalable content moderation in
specialized mental health domains.

Motivation: 解决现有半监督学习方法在息肉分割中因忽略结构特性导致的泛化能力不足问题。

Method: 通过两阶段过程：学习域不变频率先验，并对未标记图像进行频谱扰动以对齐振幅谱。

Result: 在六个公共数据集上表现优异，零样本泛化能力显著提升。

Conclusion: FPGM显著提高了有限监督下的跨域鲁棒性，为临床部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Automated polyp segmentation is essential for early diagnosis of colorectal
cancer, yet developing robust models remains challenging due to limited
annotated data and significant performance degradation under domain shift.
Although semi-supervised learning (SSL) reduces annotation requirements,
existing methods rely on generic augmentations that ignore polyp-specific
structural properties, resulting in poor generalization to new imaging centers
and devices. To address this, we introduce Frequency Prior Guided Matching
(FPGM), a novel augmentation framework built on a key discovery: polyp edges
exhibit a remarkably consistent frequency signature across diverse datasets.
FPGM leverages this intrinsic regularity in a two-stage process. It first
learns a domain-invariant frequency prior from the edge regions of labeled
polyps. Then, it performs principled spectral perturbations on unlabeled
images, aligning their amplitude spectra with this learned prior while
preserving phase information to maintain structural integrity. This targeted
alignment normalizes domain-specific textural variations, thereby compelling
the model to learn the underlying, generalizable anatomical structure.
Validated on six public datasets, FPGM establishes a new state-of-the-art
against ten competing methods. It demonstrates exceptional zero-shot
generalization capabilities, achieving over 10% absolute gain in Dice score in
data-scarce scenarios. By significantly enhancing cross-domain robustness, FPGM
presents a powerful solution for clinically deployable polyp segmentation under
limited supervision.

Conclusion: 视觉反射是提升LMMs视觉识别鲁棒性和可解释性的有效策略。

Abstract: This paper presents several novel findings on the explainability of vision
reflection in large multimodal models (LMMs). First, we show that prompting an
LMM to verify the prediction of a specialized vision model can improve
recognition accuracy, even on benchmarks like ImageNet, despite prior evidence
that LMMs typically underperform dedicated vision encoders. Second, we analyze
the internal behavior of vision reflection and find that the vision-language
connector maps visual features into explicit textual concepts, allowing the
language model to reason about prediction plausibility using commonsense
knowledge. We further observe that replacing a large number of vision tokens
with only a few text tokens still enables LLaVA to generate similar answers,
suggesting that LMMs may rely primarily on a compact set of distilled textual
representations rather than raw vision features. Third, we show that a
training-free connector can enhance LMM performance in fine-grained recognition
tasks, without extensive feature-alignment training. Together, these findings
offer new insights into the explainability of vision-language models and
suggest that vision reflection is a promising strategy for achieving robust and
interpretable visual recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频行为识别在公共安全、智能监控和人机交互中至关重要，但传统3D CNN难以建模长程依赖，而Transformer计算成本高。

Method: 通过3D CNN提取低层时空特征，Transformer捕捉长程时间依赖，并通过融合机制整合两者。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于传统3D CNN和单独Transformer，识别精度更高且复杂度可控。

Conclusion: 混合框架为视频行为识别提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Video-based behavior recognition is essential in fields such as public
safety, intelligent surveillance, and human-computer interaction. Traditional
3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) effectively capture local
spatiotemporal features but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies.
Conversely, Transformers excel at learning global contextual information but
face challenges with high computational costs. To address these limitations, we
propose a hybrid framework combining 3D CNN and Transformer architectures. The
3D CNN module extracts low-level spatiotemporal features, while the Transformer
module captures long-range temporal dependencies, with a fusion mechanism
integrating both representations. Evaluated on benchmark datasets, the proposed
model outperforms traditional 3D CNN and standalone Transformers, achieving
higher recognition accuracy with manageable complexity. Ablation studies
further validate the complementary strengths of the two modules. This hybrid
framework offers an effective and scalable solution for video-based behavior
recognition.

TL;DR: RMT-PPAD是一种基于Transformer的多任务实时模型，用于自动驾驶感知任务，包括目标检测、可行驶区域分割和车道线分割，通过轻量级模块和自适应解码器优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统需要高精度和实时性的全景驾驶感知，现有方法在多任务处理中存在负迁移和标签不一致问题。

Method: 提出RMT-PPAD模型，采用门控适配器融合共享和任务特定特征，设计自适应分割解码器，并解决车道线分割中的标签不一致问题。

Result: 在BDD100K数据集上，目标检测mAP50为84.9%，召回率95.4%；可行驶区域分割mIoU为92.6%；车道线分割IoU为56.8%，准确率84.7%；推理速度32.6 FPS。

Conclusion: RMT-PPAD在性能和速度上均达到先进水平，并在实际场景中表现稳定，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely on panoptic driving perception that requires
both precision and real-time performance. In this work, we propose RMT-PPAD, a
real-time, transformer-based multi-task model that jointly performs object
detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line segmentation. We introduce
a lightweight module, a gate control with an adapter to adaptively fuse shared
and task-specific features, effectively alleviating negative transfer between
tasks. Additionally, we design an adaptive segmentation decoder to learn the
weights over multi-scale features automatically during the training stage. This
avoids the manual design of task-specific structures for different segmentation
tasks. We also identify and resolve the inconsistency between training and
testing labels in lane line segmentation. This allows fairer evaluation.
Experiments on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate that RMT-PPAD achieves
state-of-the-art results with mAP50 of 84.9% and Recall of 95.4% for object
detection, mIoU of 92.6% for drivable area segmentation, and IoU of 56.8% and
accuracy of 84.7% for lane line segmentation. The inference speed reaches 32.6
FPS. Moreover, we introduce real-world scenarios to evaluate RMT-PPAD
performance in practice. The results show that RMT-PPAD consistently delivers
stable performance. The source codes and pre-trained models are released at

TL;DR: HOPE基准测试通过生成误导性干扰项，更严格评估大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的幻觉问题，显著优于POPE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有POPE基准在评估LVLMs的物体幻觉问题时效果下降，因其采样策略简单且忽略图像特定信息。

Method: HOPE利用CLIP选择高预测似然的负对象作为干扰项，并通过真实对象与虚假描述配对生成误导性干扰项。

Result: HOPE使多种LVLMs的精度下降9%至23%，显著暴露其幻觉漏洞。

Conclusion: HOPE为LVLMs的幻觉问题提供了更严格的评估方法，优于现有基准。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), empowered by the success of Large
Language Models (LLMs), have achieved impressive performance across domains.
Despite the great advances in LVLMs, they still suffer from the unavailable
object hallucination issue, which tends to generate objects inconsistent with
the image content. The most commonly used Polling-based Object Probing
Evaluation (POPE) benchmark evaluates this issue by sampling negative
categories according to category-level statistics, \textit{e.g.}, category
frequencies and co-occurrence. However, with the continuous advancement of
LVLMs, the POPE benchmark has shown diminishing effectiveness in assessing
object hallucination, as it employs a simplistic sampling strategy that
overlooks image-specific information and restricts distractors to negative
object categories only. In this paper, we introduce the Hallucination
searching-based Object Probing Evaluation (HOPE) benchmark, aiming to generate
the most misleading distractors (\textit{i.e.}, non-existent objects or
incorrect image descriptions) that can trigger hallucination in LVLMs, which
serves as a means to more rigorously assess their immunity to hallucination. To
explore the image-specific information, the content-aware hallucination
searching leverages Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) to
approximate the predictive behavior of LVLMs by selecting negative objects with
the highest predicted likelihood as distractors. To expand the scope of
hallucination assessment, the description-based hallucination searching
constructs highly misleading distractors by pairing true objects with false
descriptions. Experimental results show that HOPE leads to a precision drop of
at least 9\% and up to 23\% across various state-of-the-art LVLMs,
significantly outperforming POPE in exposing hallucination vulnerabilities. The
code is available at https://github.com/xiemk/HOPE.

signal sparsity found in non-commercial domains. MobilTelesco, a
smartphone-based astrophotography dataset, addresses this by providing sparse
night-sky images. We benchmark several detection models on it, highlighting
challenges under feature-deficient conditions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MILD的新方法，用于解决复杂多实例场景下的人像擦除问题，通过分层扩散和形态学指导显著提升了效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂多实例场景（如人-人遮挡、人-物纠缠和背景干扰）中表现不佳，主要由于数据集限制和缺乏空间解耦能力。

Method: 提出Multi-Layer Diffusion (MILD)策略，将生成过程分解为语义分离的路径，并引入Human Morphology Guidance和Spatially-Modulated Attention。

Result: MILD在挑战性的人像擦除基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MILD通过分层扩散和形态学指导，有效解决了复杂场景下的人像擦除问题。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the success of diffusion models in
image-customized tasks. Prior works have achieved notable progress on
human-oriented erasing using explicit mask guidance and semantic-aware
inpainting. However, they struggle under complex multi-IP scenarios involving
human-human occlusions, human-object entanglements, and background
interferences. These challenges are mainly due to: 1) Dataset limitations, as
existing datasets rarely cover dense occlusions, camouflaged backgrounds, and
diverse interactions; 2) Lack of spatial decoupling, where foreground instances
cannot be effectively disentangled, limiting clean background restoration. In
this work, we introduce a high-quality multi-IP human erasing dataset with
diverse pose variations and complex backgrounds. We then propose Multi-Layer
Diffusion (MILD), a novel strategy that decomposes generation into semantically
separated pathways for each instance and the background. To enhance
human-centric understanding, we introduce Human Morphology Guidance,
integrating pose, parsing, and spatial relations. We further present
Spatially-Modulated Attention to better guide attention flow. Extensive
experiments show that MILD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on challenging
human erasing benchmarks.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在仅使用多视角图像作为输入的情况下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过语义和空间信息增强特征，结合统计先验，实现了高效的3D语义场景图估计。

Abstract: Modern 3D semantic scene graph estimation methods utilize ground truth 3D
annotations to accurately predict target objects, predicates, and
relationships. In the absence of given 3D ground truth representations, we
explore leveraging only multi-view RGB images to tackle this task. To attain
robust features for accurate scene graph estimation, we must overcome the noisy
reconstructed pseudo point-based geometry from predicted depth maps and reduce
the amount of background noise present in multi-view image features. The key is
to enrich node and edge features with accurate semantic and spatial information
and through neighboring relations. We obtain semantic masks to guide feature
aggregation to filter background features and design a novel method to
incorporate neighboring node information to aid robustness of our scene graph
estimates. Furthermore, we leverage on explicit statistical priors calculated
from the training summary statistics to refine node and edge predictions based
on their one-hop neighborhood. Our experiments show that our method outperforms
current methods purely using multi-view images as the initial input. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度神经网络训练资源密集、适应多样化需求时效率低下的问题。

Method: 提出NNObfuscator机制，通过动态调整模型性能实现单一模型适应多任务需求。

Result: 实验验证NNObfuscator能有效提升模型适应性，减少计算资源浪费。

Conclusion: NNObfuscator为AI部署提供了一种高效、可持续的解决方案。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) has become an increasingly
resource-intensive task, requiring large volumes of labeled data, substantial
computational power, and considerable fine-tuning efforts to achieve optimal
performance across diverse use cases. Although pre-trained models offer a
useful starting point, adapting them to meet specific user needs often demands
extensive customization, and infrastructure overhead. This challenge grows when
a single model must support diverse appli-cations with differing requirements
for performance. Traditional solutions often involve training multiple model
versions to meet varying requirements, which can be inefficient and difficult
to maintain. In order to overcome this challenge, we propose NNObfuscator, a
novel utility control mechanism that enables AI models to dynamically modify
their performance according to predefined conditions. It is different from
traditional methods that need separate models for each user. Instead,
NNObfuscator allows a single model to be adapted in real time, giving you
controlled access to multiple levels of performance. This mechanism enables
model owners set up tiered access, ensuring that free-tier users receive a
baseline level of performance while premium users benefit from enhanced
capabilities. The approach improves resource allocation, reduces unnecessary
computation, and supports sustainable business models in AI deployment. To
validate our approach, we conducted experiments on multiple tasks, including
image classification, semantic segmentation, and text to image generation,
using well-established models such as ResNet, DeepLab, VGG16, FCN and Stable
Diffusion. Experimental results show that NNObfuscator successfully makes model
more adaptable, so that a single trained model can handle a broad range of
tasks without requiring a lot of changes.

Abstract: The challenges associated with deepfake detection are increasing
significantly with the latest advancements in technology and the growing
popularity of deepfake videos and images. Despite the presence of numerous
detection models, demographic bias in the deepfake dataset remains largely
unaddressed. This paper focuses on the mitigation of age-specific bias in the
deepfake dataset by introducing an age-diverse deepfake dataset that will
improve fairness across age groups. The dataset is constructed through a
modular pipeline incorporating the existing deepfake datasets Celeb-DF,
FaceForensics++, and UTKFace datasets, and the creation of synthetic data to
fill the age distribution gaps. The effectiveness and generalizability of this
dataset are evaluated using three deepfake detection models: XceptionNet,
EfficientNet, and LipForensics. Evaluation metrics, including AUC, pAUC, and
EER, revealed that models trained on the age-diverse dataset demonstrated
fairer performance across age groups, improved overall accuracy, and higher
generalization across datasets. This study contributes a reproducible,
fairness-aware deepfake dataset and model pipeline that can serve as a
foundation for future research in fairer deepfake detection. The complete
dataset and implementation code are available at

spanning individual items, complete outfits, and try-on efficacy.
Counterexamples are aggregated into negative prompts, forming a closed-loop

<details>

Motivation: 目标检测数据集中的标签错误（如缺失标签、错误分类或定位不准确）会影响训练和评估结果，但目前缺乏系统性的大规模修正方法。

Method: REC$\checkmark$D框架结合现有错误检测器和众包微任务，通过多标注者独立验证候选边界框，并聚合响应以估计模糊性并提升标签质量。

Result: 在KITTI数据集的“行人”类中，REC$\checkmark$D发现至少24%的原始标注存在缺失或不准确，并生成了高质量修正标注。

Conclusion: 当前标签错误检测方法结合REC$\checkmark$D可高效修正错误，但仍需进一步研究，论文发布的基准数据集为此提供了支持。

Abstract: Object detection has advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by increasingly
large and diverse datasets. However, label errors, defined as missing labels,
incorrect classification or inaccurate localization, often compromise the
quality of these datasets. This can have a significant impact on the outcomes
of training and benchmark evaluations. Although several methods now exist for
detecting label errors in object detection datasets, they are typically
validated only on synthetic benchmarks or limited manual inspection. How to
correct such errors systemically and at scale therefore remains an open
problem. We introduce a semi-automated framework for label-error correction
called REC$\checkmark$D (Rechecked). Building on existing detectors, the
framework pairs their error proposals with lightweight, crowd-sourced
microtasks. These tasks enable multiple annotators to independently verify each
candidate bounding box, and their responses are aggregated to estimate
ambiguity and improve label quality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
REC$\checkmark$D, we apply it to the class pedestrian in the KITTI dataset. Our
crowdsourced review yields high-quality corrected annotations, which indicate a
rate of at least 24% of missing and inaccurate annotations in original
annotations. This validated set will be released as a new real-world benchmark
for label error detection and correction. We show that current label error
detection methods, when combined with our correction framework, can recover
hundreds of errors in the time it would take a human to annotate bounding boxes
from scratch. However, even the best methods still miss up to 66% of the true
errors and with low quality labels introduce more errors than they find. This
highlights the urgent need for further research, now enabled by our released
benchmark.

Motivation: 在临床实践中部署深度学习模型时，常需利用多模态数据（如图像、文本、结构化数据）以获得稳健决策，但推理时并非所有模态都可用。

Method: 提出MMPKD训练策略，使用仅在训练时可用的额外模态（如文本或表格数据）指导单模态视觉模型（如视觉变换器）。

Result: MMPKD提升了注意力图在输入图像中定位感兴趣区域（ROI）的零样本能力，但效果不跨域。

Conclusion: MMPKD能有效利用训练时额外模态提升单模态模型性能，但跨域泛化能力有限。

Abstract: Deploying deep learning models in clinical practice often requires leveraging
multiple data modalities, such as images, text, and structured data, to achieve
robust and trustworthy decisions. However, not all modalities are always
available at inference time. In this work, we propose multimodal privileged
knowledge distillation (MMPKD), a training strategy that utilizes additional
modalities available solely during training to guide a unimodal vision model.
Specifically, we used a text-based teacher model for chest radiographs
(MIMIC-CXR) and a tabular metadata-based teacher model for mammography
(CBIS-DDSM) to distill knowledge into a vision transformer student model. We
show that MMPKD can improve the resulting attention maps' zero-shot
capabilities of localizing ROI in input images, while this effect does not
generalize across domains, as contrarily suggested by prior research.

Result: 在IEMOCAP和MELD数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VEGA机制通过心理学理论指导的多模态对齐，显著提升了情感识别任务的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations remains a challenging task
due to the complex interplay of textual, acoustic and visual signals. While
recent models have improved performance via advanced fusion strategies, they
often lack psychologically meaningful priors to guide multimodal alignment. In
this paper, we revisit the use of CLIP and propose a novel Visual Emotion
Guided Anchoring (VEGA) mechanism that introduces class-level visual semantics
into the fusion and classification process. Distinct from prior work that
primarily utilizes CLIP's textual encoder, our approach leverages its image
encoder to construct emotion-specific visual anchors based on facial exemplars.
These anchors guide unimodal and multimodal features toward a perceptually
grounded and psychologically aligned representation space, drawing inspiration
from cognitive theories (prototypical emotion categories and multisensory
integration). A stochastic anchor sampling strategy further enhances robustness
by balancing semantic stability and intra-class diversity. Integrated into a
dual-branch architecture with self-distillation, our VEGA-augmented model
achieves sota performance on IEMOCAP and MELD. Code is available at:

Abstract: Integrating brain imaging data with clinical reports offers a valuable
opportunity to leverage complementary multimodal information for more effective
and timely diagnosis in practical clinical settings. This approach has gained
significant attention in brain disorder research, yet a key challenge remains:
how to effectively link objective imaging data with subjective text-based
reports, such as doctors' notes. In this work, we propose a novel framework
that aligns brain connectomes with clinical reports in a shared cross-modal
latent space at both the subject and connectome levels, thereby enhancing
representation learning. The key innovation of our approach is that we treat
brain subnetworks as tokens of imaging data, rather than raw image patches, to
align with word tokens in clinical reports. This enables a more efficient
identification of system-level associations between neuroimaging findings and
clinical observations, which is critical since brain disorders often manifest
as network-level abnormalities rather than isolated regional alterations. We
applied our method to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using the ADNI dataset.
Our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance but also
identifies clinically meaningful connectome-text pairs, offering new insights
into the early mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease and supporting the development
of clinically useful multimodal biomarkers.

Motivation: 表面材料识别是机器人感知和物理交互的关键组成部分，尤其是在利用触觉和视觉感官输入时。

Method: 提出Surformer v1，结合结构化触觉特征和PCA降维的视觉嵌入，使用模态特定编码器和跨模态注意力层。实验包括触觉单独分类和多模态融合。

Conclusion: Surformer v1在准确性、效率和计算成本之间提供了理想的平衡，适用于实时表面材料识别。

Abstract: Surface material recognition is a key component in robotic perception and
physical interaction, particularly when leveraging both tactile and visual
sensory inputs. In this work, we propose Surformer v1, a transformer-based
architecture designed for surface classification using structured tactile
features and PCA-reduced visual embeddings extracted via ResNet-50. The model
integrates modality-specific encoders with cross-modal attention layers,
enabling rich interactions between vision and touch. Currently,
state-of-the-art deep learning models for vision tasks have achieved remarkable
performance. With this in mind, our first set of experiments focused
exclusively on tactile-only surface classification. Using feature engineering,
we trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models, assessing their
accuracy and inference time. We then implemented an encoder-only Transformer
model tailored for tactile features. This model not only achieved the highest
accuracy but also demonstrated significantly faster inference time compared to
other evaluated models, highlighting its potential for real-time applications.
To extend this investigation, we introduced a multimodal fusion setup by
combining vision and tactile inputs. We trained both Surformer v1 (using
structured features) and Multimodal CNN (using raw images) to examine the
impact of feature-based versus image-based multimodal learning on
classification accuracy and computational efficiency. The results showed that
Surformer v1 achieved 99.4% accuracy with an inference time of 0.77 ms, while
the Multimodal CNN achieved slightly higher accuracy but required significantly
more inference time. These findings suggest Surformer v1 offers a compelling
balance between accuracy, efficiency, and computational cost for surface
material recognition.

speech detection, video-based approaches remain underexplored. In this work, we
introduce a novel dataset, ImpliHateVid, specifically curated for implicit hate
speech detection in videos. ImpliHateVid consists of 2,009 videos comprising
509 implicit hate videos, 500 explicit hate videos, and 1,000 non-hate videos,
making it one of the first large-scale video datasets dedicated to implicit
hate detection. We also propose a novel two-stage contrastive learning
framework for hate speech detection in videos. In the first stage, we train
modality-specific encoders for audio, text, and image using contrastive loss by
concatenating features from the three encoders. In the second stage, we train
cross-encoders using contrastive learning to refine multimodal representations.
Additionally, we incorporate sentiment, emotion, and caption-based features to
enhance implicit hate detection. We evaluate our method on two datasets,
ImpliHateVid for implicit hate speech detection and another dataset for general
hate speech detection in videos, HateMM dataset, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the proposed multimodal contrastive learning for hateful
content detection in videos and the significance of our dataset.

*Sihan Ma,Qiming Wu,Ruotong Jiang,Frank Burns*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ContextGuard-LVLM的新框架，用于解决数字新闻媒体中视觉与文本信息的细粒度跨模态一致性（FCCC）问题，通过多阶段上下文推理机制和强化/对抗学习，显著提升了检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字新闻媒体的普及需要验证内容真实性，传统方法在细粒度跨模态一致性（FCCC）问题上表现不足，需更深入的视觉叙事、情感基调与文本的对齐。

Method: 基于先进的视觉-语言大模型（LVLMs），提出ContextGuard-LVLM框架，结合多阶段上下文推理机制和强化/对抗学习，检测细微的上下文不一致。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于现有零样本基线模型（如InstructBLIP和LLaVA 1.5），尤其在复杂逻辑推理和上下文理解任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: ContextGuard-LVLM在检测复杂上下文不一致方面表现出色，对细微扰动具有更强的鲁棒性，并与人类专家判断高度一致。

Abstract: The proliferation of digital news media necessitates robust methods for
verifying content veracity, particularly regarding the consistency between
visual and textual information. Traditional approaches often fall short in
addressing the fine-grained cross-modal contextual consistency (FCCC) problem,
which encompasses deeper alignment of visual narrative, emotional tone, and
background information with text, beyond mere entity matching. To address this,
we propose ContextGuard-LVLM, a novel framework built upon advanced
Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) and integrating a multi-stage contextual
reasoning mechanism. Our model is uniquely enhanced through reinforced or
adversarial learning paradigms, enabling it to detect subtle contextual
misalignments that evade zero-shot baselines. We extend and augment three
established datasets (TamperedNews-Ent, News400-Ent, MMG-Ent) with new
fine-grained contextual annotations, including "contextual sentiment," "visual
narrative theme," and "scene-event logical coherence," and introduce a
comprehensive CTXT (Contextual Coherence) entity type. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that ContextGuard-LVLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
zero-shot LVLM baselines (InstructBLIP and LLaVA 1.5) across nearly all
fine-grained consistency tasks, showing significant improvements in complex
logical reasoning and nuanced contextual understanding. Furthermore, our model
exhibits superior robustness to subtle perturbations and a higher agreement
rate with human expert judgments on challenging samples, affirming its efficacy
in discerning sophisticated forms of context detachment.

Method: 分为多模态概念感知模块和可解释疾病推理模块，结合视觉和语言信息进行诊断。

Result: 在Derm7pt数据集上，疾病诊断和概念检测性能均达到最优（BACC 83.55%和76.10%）。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of skin diseases remains a significant challenge due to
the complex and diverse visual features present in dermatoscopic images, often
compounded by a lack of interpretability in existing purely visual diagnostic
models. To address these limitations, this study introduces VL-MedGuide
(Visual-Linguistic Medical Guide), a novel framework leveraging the powerful
multi-modal understanding and reasoning capabilities of Visual-Language Large
Models (LVLMs) for intelligent and inherently interpretable auxiliary diagnosis
of skin conditions. VL-MedGuide operates in two interconnected stages: a
Multi-modal Concept Perception Module, which identifies and linguistically
describes dermatologically relevant visual features through sophisticated
prompt engineering, and an Explainable Disease Reasoning Module, which
integrates these concepts with raw visual information via Chain-of-Thought
prompting to provide precise disease diagnoses alongside transparent
rationales. Comprehensive experiments on the Derm7pt dataset demonstrate that
VL-MedGuide achieves state-of-the-art performance in both disease diagnosis
(83.55% BACC, 80.12% F1) and concept detection (76.10% BACC, 67.45% F1),
surpassing existing baselines. Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the high
clarity, completeness, and trustworthiness of its generated explanations,
bridging the gap between AI performance and clinical utility by offering
actionable, explainable insights for dermatological practice.

Abstract: We introduce a diffusion-based cross-domain image translator in the absence
of paired training data. Unlike GAN-based methods, our approach integrates
diffusion models to learn the image translation process, allowing for more
coverable modeling of the data distribution and performance improvement of the
cross-domain translation. However, incorporating the translation process within
the diffusion process is still challenging since the two processes are not
aligned exactly, i.e., the diffusion process is applied to the noisy signal
while the translation process is conducted on the clean signal. As a result,
recent diffusion-based studies employ separate training or shallow integration
to learn the two processes, yet this may cause the local minimal of the
translation optimization, constraining the effectiveness of diffusion models.
To address the problem, we propose a novel joint learning framework that aligns
the diffusion and the translation process, thereby improving the global
optimality. Specifically, we propose to extract the image components with
diffusion models to represent the clean signal and employ the translation
process with the image components, enabling an end-to-end joint learning
manner. On the other hand, we introduce a time-dependent translation network to
learn the complex translation mapping, resulting in effective translation
learning and significant performance improvement. Benefiting from the design of
joint learning, our method enables global optimization of both processes,
enhancing the optimality and achieving improved fidelity and structural
consistency. We have conducted extensive experiments on RGB$\leftrightarrow$RGB
and diverse cross-modality translation tasks including
RGB$\leftrightarrow$Edge, RGB$\leftrightarrow$Semantics and
RGB$\leftrightarrow$Depth, showcasing better generative performances than the
state of the arts.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个挑战性基准测试中能生成更锐利和真实的镜面高光。

Conclusion: 这种分解范式为神经场景表示中复杂外观建模提供了灵活有效的方向。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown impressive performance in novel view
synthesis, but challenges remain in rendering scenes with complex specular
reflections and highlights. Existing approaches may produce blurry reflections
due to entanglement between lighting and material properties, or encounter
optimization instability when relying on physically-based inverse rendering. In
this work, we present a neural rendering framework based on dynamic coefficient
decomposition, aiming to improve the modeling of view-dependent appearance. Our
approach decomposes complex appearance into a shared, static neural basis that
encodes intrinsic material properties, and a set of dynamic coefficients
generated by a Coefficient Network conditioned on view and illumination. A
Dynamic Radiance Integrator then combines these components to synthesize the
final radiance. Experimental results on several challenging benchmarks suggest
that our method can produce sharper and more realistic specular highlights
compared to existing techniques. We hope that this decomposition paradigm can
provide a flexible and effective direction for modeling complex appearance in
neural scene representations.

Conclusion: CausalNet为微表情识别提供了更实用的解决方案，解决了关键帧误差问题并提升了性能。

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a highly challenging task in affective
computing. With the reduced-sized micro-expression (ME) input that contains key
information based on key-frame indexes, key-frame-based methods have
significantly improved the performance of MER. However, most of these methods
focus on improving the performance with relatively accurate key-frame indexes,
while ignoring the difficulty of obtaining accurate key-frame indexes and the
objective existence of key-frame index errors, which impedes them from moving
towards practical applications. In this paper, we propose CausalNet, a novel
framework to achieve robust MER facing key-frame index errors while maintaining
accurate recognition. To enhance robustness, CausalNet takes the representation
of the entire ME sequence as the input. To address the information redundancy
brought by the complete ME range input and maintain accurate recognition,
first, the Causal Motion Position Learning Module (CMPLM) is proposed to help
the model locate the muscle movement areas related to Action Units (AUs),
thereby reducing the attention to other redundant areas. Second, the Causal
Attention Block (CAB) is proposed to deeply learn the causal relationships
between the muscle contraction and relaxation movements in MEs. Empirical
experiments have demonstrated that on popular ME benchmarks, the CausalNet has
achieved robust MER under different levels of key-frame index noise. Meanwhile,
it has surpassed state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on several standard MER
benchmarks when using the provided annotated key-frames. Code is available at

Abstract: In-generation watermarking for detecting and attributing generated content
has recently been explored for latent diffusion models (LDMs), demonstrating
high robustness. However, the use of in-generation watermarks in autoregressive
(AR) image models has not been explored yet. AR models generate images by
autoregressively predicting a sequence of visual tokens that are then decoded
into pixels using a vector-quantized decoder. Inspired by red-green watermarks
for large language models, we examine token-level watermarking schemes that
bias the next-token prediction based on prior tokens. We find that a direct
transfer of these schemes works in principle, but the detectability of the
watermarks decreases considerably under common image perturbations. As a
remedy, we propose two novel watermarking methods that rely on visual token
clustering to assign similar tokens to the same set. Firstly, we investigate a
training-free approach that relies on a cluster lookup table, and secondly, we
finetune VAE encoders to predict token clusters directly from perturbed images.
Overall, our experiments show that cluster-level watermarks improve robustness
against perturbations and regeneration attacks while preserving image quality.
Cluster classification further boosts watermark detectability, outperforming a
set of baselines. Moreover, our methods offer fast verification runtime,
comparable to lightweight post-hoc watermarking methods.

Motivation: 现代视觉系统依赖冗余的视觉输入，而人类却能轻松理解稀疏的线描，这表明结构而非外观是高效视觉理解的关键。

Method: 提出使用线描进行预训练，并扩展到无监督设置，通过“学习绘制”方法实现。

Conclusion: 结构优先的视觉学习能提升效率、泛化能力和与人类对齐的归纳偏差，为构建更鲁棒的视觉系统提供策略。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in computer vision, modern recognition systems
remain limited by their dependence on rich, redundant visual inputs. In
contrast, humans can effortlessly understand sparse, minimal representations
like line drawings - suggesting that structure, rather than appearance,
underlies efficient visual understanding. In this work, we propose using line
drawings as a structure-first pretraining modality to induce more compact and
generalizable visual representations. We show that models pretrained on line
drawings develop stronger shape bias, more focused attention, and greater data
efficiency across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. Notably,
these models also exhibit lower intrinsic dimensionality, requiring
significantly fewer principal components to capture representational variance -
echoing the similar observation in low dimensional efficient representation in
the brain. Beyond performance improvements, line drawing pretraining produces
more compressible representations, enabling better distillation into
lightweight student models. Students distilled from line-pretrained teachers
consistently outperform those trained from color-supervised teachers,
highlighting the benefits of structurally compact knowledge. Finally, we
demonstrate that the pretraining with line-drawing can also be extended to
unsupervised setting via our proposed method "learning to draw". Together, our
results support the view that structure-first visual learning fosters
efficiency, generalization, and human-aligned inductive biases - offering a
simple yet powerful strategy for building more robust and adaptable vision
systems.

Conclusion: MMFformer在多模态抑郁检测中优于现有方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Depression is a serious mental health illness that significantly affects an
individual's well-being and quality of life, making early detection crucial for
adequate care and treatment. Detecting depression is often difficult, as it is
based primarily on subjective evaluations during clinical interviews. Hence,
the early diagnosis of depression, thanks to the content of social networks,
has become a prominent research area. The extensive and diverse nature of
user-generated information poses a significant challenge, limiting the accurate
extraction of relevant temporal information and the effective fusion of data
across multiple modalities. This paper introduces MMFformer, a multimodal
depression detection network designed to retrieve depressive spatio-temporal
high-level patterns from multimodal social media information. The transformer
network with residual connections captures spatial features from videos, and a
transformer encoder is exploited to design important temporal dynamics in
audio. Moreover, the fusion architecture fused the extracted features through
late and intermediate fusion strategies to find out the most relevant
intermodal correlations among them. Finally, the proposed network is assessed
on two large-scale depression detection datasets, and the results clearly
reveal that it surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches, improving the
F1-Score by 13.92% for D-Vlog dataset and 7.74% for LMVD dataset. The code is

This input data is reconstructed into volumetric objects that are then input
into non-convex Fourier optics optimization algorithms for phase-only hologram

Abstract: Creating deformable 3D content has gained increasing attention with the rise
of text-to-image and image-to-video generative models. While these models
provide rich semantic priors for appearance, they struggle to capture the
physical realism and motion dynamics needed for authentic 4D scene synthesis.
In contrast, real-world videos can provide physically grounded geometry and
articulation cues that are difficult to hallucinate. One question is raised:
\textit{Can we generate physically consistent 4D content by leveraging the
motion priors of the real-world video}? In this work, we explore the task of
reanimating deformable 3D scenes from a single video, using the original
sequence as a supervisory signal to correct artifacts from synthetic motion. We
introduce \textbf{Restage4D}, a geometry-preserving pipeline for
video-conditioned 4D restaging. Our approach uses a video-rewinding training
strategy to temporally bridge a real base video and a synthetic driving video
via a shared motion representation. We further incorporate an occlusion-aware
rigidity loss and a disocclusion backtracing mechanism to improve structural
and geometry consistency under challenging motion. We validate Restage4D on
DAVIS and PointOdyssey, demonstrating improved geometry consistency, motion
quality, and 3D tracking performance. Our method not only preserves deformable
structure under novel motion, but also automatically corrects errors introduced
by generative models, revealing the potential of video prior in 4D restaging
task. Source code and trained models will be released.

Abstract: Accurate, noninvasive detection of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation is
essential for effective glioma management. Traditional methods rely on invasive
tissue sampling, which may fail to capture a tumor's spatial heterogeneity.
While deep learning models have shown promise in molecular profiling, their
performance is often limited by scarce annotated data. In contrast, foundation
deep learning models offer a more generalizable approach for glioma imaging
biomarkers. We propose a Foundation-based Biomarker Network (FoundBioNet) that
utilizes a SWIN-UNETR-based architecture to noninvasively predict IDH mutation
status from multi-parametric MRI. Two key modules are incorporated: Tumor-Aware
Feature Encoding (TAFE) for extracting multi-scale, tumor-focused features, and
Cross-Modality Differential (CMD) for highlighting subtle T2-FLAIR mismatch
signals associated with IDH mutation. The model was trained and validated on a
diverse, multi-center cohort of 1705 glioma patients from six public datasets.
Our model achieved AUCs of 90.58%, 88.08%, 65.41%, and 80.31% on independent
test sets from EGD, TCGA, Ivy GAP, RHUH, and UPenn, consistently outperforming
baseline approaches (p <= 0.05). Ablation studies confirmed that both the TAFE
and CMD modules are essential for improving predictive accuracy. By integrating
large-scale pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, FoundBioNet enables
generalizable glioma characterization. This approach enhances diagnostic
accuracy and interpretability, with the potential to enable more personalized
patient care.

Abstract: Human pose and shape (HPS) estimation methods have been extensively studied,
with many demonstrating high zero-shot performance on in-the-wild images and
videos. However, these methods often struggle in challenging scenarios
involving complex human poses or significant occlusions. Although some studies
address 3D human pose estimation under occlusion, they typically evaluate
performance on datasets that lack realistic or substantial occlusions, e.g.,
most existing datasets introduce occlusions with random patches over the human
or clipart-style overlays, which may not reflect real-world challenges. To
bridge this gap in realistic occlusion datasets, we introduce a novel benchmark
dataset, VOccl3D, a Video-based human Occlusion dataset with 3D body pose and
shape annotations. Inspired by works such as AGORA and BEDLAM, we constructed
this dataset using advanced computer graphics rendering techniques,
incorporating diverse real-world occlusion scenarios, clothing textures, and
human motions. Additionally, we fine-tuned recent HPS methods, CLIFF and
BEDLAM-CLIFF, on our dataset, demonstrating significant qualitative and
quantitative improvements across multiple public datasets, as well as on the
test split of our dataset, while comparing its performance with other
state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we leveraged our dataset to enhance
human detection performance under occlusion by fine-tuning an existing object
detector, YOLO11, thus leading to a robust end-to-end HPS estimation system
under occlusions. Overall, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for
future research aimed at benchmarking methods designed to handle occlusions,
offering a more realistic alternative to existing occlusion datasets. See the

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress
across a range of vision-language tasks and demonstrate strong potential for
traffic accident understanding. However, existing MLLMs in this domain
primarily focus on coarse-grained image-level or video-level comprehension and
often struggle to handle fine-grained visual details or localized scene
components, limiting their applicability in complex accident scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose SafePLUG, a novel framework that empowers
MLLMs with both Pixel-Level Understanding and temporal Grounding for
comprehensive traffic accident analysis. SafePLUG supports both
arbitrary-shaped visual prompts for region-aware question answering and
pixel-level segmentation based on language instructions, while also enabling
the recognition of temporally anchored events in traffic accident scenarios. To
advance the development of MLLMs for traffic accident understanding, we curate
a new dataset containing multimodal question-answer pairs centered on diverse
accident scenarios, with detailed pixel-level annotations and temporal event
boundaries. Experimental results show that SafePLUG achieves strong performance
on multiple tasks, including region-based question answering, pixel-level
segmentation, temporal event localization, and accident event understanding.
These capabilities lay a foundation for fine-grained understanding of complex

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决术中超声图像噪声、伪影及与术前MRI/CT对齐困难的问题，填补术前规划与术中引导的差距。

Method: 通过机器学习将MRI 3D扫描转换为声阻抗体积，使用射线追踪模拟超声波传播，并通过稀疏线性系统捕捉多次内部反射，最终生成B模式图像。

Result: 在ReMIND数据集上验证了DiffUS能够从脑MRI数据生成解剖学准确的超声图像。

Conclusion: DiffUS为术中超声图像生成提供了一种高效且可微分的解决方案，适用于切片到体积配准等下游任务。

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound imaging provides real-time guidance during numerous
surgical procedures, but its interpretation is complicated by noise, artifacts,
and poor alignment with high-resolution preoperative MRI/CT scans. To bridge
the gap between reoperative planning and intraoperative guidance, we present
DiffUS, a physics-based, differentiable ultrasound renderer that synthesizes
realistic B-mode images from volumetric imaging. DiffUS first converts MRI 3D
scans into acoustic impedance volumes using a machine learning approach. Next,
we simulate ultrasound beam propagation using ray tracing with coupled
reflection-transmission equations. DiffUS formulates wave propagation as a
sparse linear system that captures multiple internal reflections. Finally, we
reconstruct B-mode images via depth-resolved echo extraction across fan-shaped
acquisition geometry, incorporating realistic artifacts including speckle noise
and depth-dependent degradation. DiffUS is entirely implemented as
differentiable tensor operations in PyTorch, enabling gradient-based
optimization for downstream applications such as slice-to-volume registration
and volumetric reconstruction. Evaluation on the ReMIND dataset demonstrates
DiffUS's ability to generate anatomically accurate ultrasound images from brain
MRI data.

Result: 在CT和MRI数据集上，边界定位精度显著优于基线方法，下游任务（如分割、配准）性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法生成的精确边缘对医学图像任务具有重要临床价值。

Abstract: Accurate localization of organ boundaries is critical in medical imaging for
segmentation, registration, surgical planning, and radiotherapy. While deep
convolutional networks (ConvNets) have advanced general-purpose edge detection
to near-human performance on natural images, their outputs often lack precise
localization, a limitation that is particularly harmful in medical applications
where millimeter-level accuracy is required. Building on a systematic analysis
of ConvNet edge outputs, we propose a medically focused crisp edge detector
that adapts a novel top-down backward refinement architecture to medical images
(2D and volumetric). Our method progressively upsamples and fuses high-level
semantic features with fine-grained low-level cues through a backward
refinement pathway, producing high-resolution, well-localized organ boundaries.
We further extend the design to handle anisotropic volumes by combining 2D
slice-wise refinement with light 3D context aggregation to retain computational
efficiency. Evaluations on several CT and MRI organ datasets demonstrate
substantially improved boundary localization under strict criteria (boundary
F-measure, Hausdorff distance) compared to baseline ConvNet detectors and
contemporary medical edge/contour methods. Importantly, integrating our crisp
edge maps into downstream pipelines yields consistent gains in organ
segmentation (higher Dice scores, lower boundary errors), more accurate image
registration, and improved delineation of lesions near organ interfaces. The
proposed approach produces clinically valuable, crisp organ edges that
materially enhance common medical-imaging tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法为自动化黑色素瘤评估系统提供了实用的基础模块，无需复杂的后处理或预训练协议。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of melanocytic tumors in dermoscopic images is a
critical step for automated skin cancer screening and clinical decision
support. Unlike natural scene segmentation, lesion delineation must reconcile
subtle texture and color variations, frequent artifacts (hairs, rulers,
bubbles), and a strong need for precise boundary localization to support
downstream diagnosis. In this paper we introduce Our method, a novel ResNet
inspired dual resolution architecture specifically designed for melanocytic
tumor segmentation. Our method maintains a full resolution stream that
preserves fine grained boundary information while a complementary pooled stream
aggregates multi scale contextual cues for robust lesion recognition. The
streams are tightly coupled by boundary aware residual connections that inject
high frequency edge information into deep feature maps, and by a channel
attention module that adapts color and texture sensitivity to dermoscopic
appearance. To further address common imaging artifacts and the limited size of
clinical datasets, we propose a lightweight artifact suppression block and a
multi task training objective that combines a Dice Tversky segmentation loss
with an explicit boundary loss and a contrastive regularizer for feature
stability. The combined design yields pixel accurate masks without requiring
heavy post processing or complex pre training protocols. Extensive experiments
on public dermoscopic benchmarks demonstrate that Our method significantly
improves boundary adherence and clinically relevant segmentation metrics
compared to standard encoder decoder baselines, making it a practical building
block for automated melanoma assessment systems.

Motivation: 解决皮下血管分割中标注稀缺、成本高以及图像对比度低、噪声多的问题。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了标注负担，同时保留了临床相关的血管拓扑结构。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of subcutaneous vessels from clinical images is
hampered by scarce, expensive ground truth and by low contrast, noisy
appearance of vessels across patients and modalities. We present a novel weakly
supervised training framework tailored for subcutaneous vessel segmentation
that leverages inexpensive sparse annotations (e.g., centerline traces, dot
markers, or short scribbles). Sparse labels are expanded into dense,
probabilistic supervision via a differentiable random walk label propagation
model whose transition weights incorporate image driven vesselness cues and
tubular continuity priors. The propagation yields per-pixel hitting
probabilities together with calibrated uncertainty estimates; these are
incorporated into an uncertainty weighted loss to avoid over fitting to
ambiguous regions. Crucially, the label-propagator is learned jointly with a
CNN based segmentation predictor, enabling the system to discover vessel edges
and continuity constraints without explicit edge supervision. We further
introduce a topology aware regularizer that encourages centerline connectivity
and penalizes spurious branches, improving clinical usability. In experiments
on clinical subcutaneous imaging datasets, our method consistently outperforms
naive training on sparse labels and conventional dense pseudo-labeling,
producing more complete vascular maps and better calibrated uncertainty for
downstream decision making. The approach substantially reduces annotation
burden while preserving clinically relevant vessel topology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多源域自适应（MSDA）方法中训练参数和计算成本高的问题，同时保持高准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 使用源无关的无监督域自适应（UDA）训练源特定的低秩适配器（LoRA），并通过轻量级门控网络动态融合这些适配器。

Result: 在Market-1501、DukeMTMC-reID和MSMT17基准测试中表现优于现有方法，且计算效率高。

Conclusion: SAGE-reID是一种高效、可扩展的MSDA方法，适用于行人重识别任务。

Abstract: Adapting person re-identification (reID) models to new target environments
remains a challenging problem that is typically addressed using unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) methods. Recent works show that when labeled data
originates from several distinct sources (e.g., datasets and cameras),
considering each source separately and applying multi-source domain adaptation
(MSDA) typically yields higher accuracy and robustness compared to blending the
sources and performing conventional UDA. However, state-of-the-art MSDA methods
learn domain-specific backbone models or require access to source domain data
during adaptation, resulting in significant growth in training parameters and
computational cost. In this paper, a Source-free Adaptive Gated Experts
(SAGE-reID) method is introduced for person reID. Our SAGE-reID is a
cost-effective, source-free MSDA method that first trains individual
source-specific low-rank adapters (LoRA) through source-free UDA. Next, a
lightweight gating network is introduced and trained to dynamically assign
optimal merging weights for fusion of LoRA experts, enabling effective
cross-domain knowledge transfer. While the number of backbone parameters
remains constant across source domains, LoRA experts scale linearly but remain
negligible in size (<= 2% of the backbone), reducing both the memory
consumption and risk of overfitting. Extensive experiments conducted on three
challenging benchmarks: Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and MSMT17 indicate that
SAGE-reID outperforms state-of-the-art methods while being computationally
efficient.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of accurately forecasting geometric
deviations in manufactured components using advanced 3D surface analysis.
Despite progress in modern manufacturing, maintaining dimensional precision
remains difficult, particularly for complex geometries. We present a
methodology that employs a high-resolution 3D scanner to acquire multi-angle
surface data from 237 components produced across different batches. The data
were processed through precise alignment, noise reduction, and merging
techniques to generate accurate 3D representations. A hybrid machine learning
framework was developed, combining convolutional neural networks for feature
extraction with gradient-boosted decision trees for predictive modeling. The
proposed system achieved a prediction accuracy of 0.012 mm at a 95% confidence
level, representing a 73% improvement over conventional statistical process
control methods. In addition to improved accuracy, the model revealed hidden
correlations between manufacturing parameters and geometric deviations. This
approach offers significant potential for automated quality control, predictive
maintenance, and design optimization in precision manufacturing, and the
resulting dataset provides a strong foundation for future predictive modeling
research.

performance across multiple evaluation metrics, offering a scalable and

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的联合稀疏自表示学习模型，用于多视图聚类，通过引入基数约束提取视图特定局部信息，并开发了具有全局收敛性的交替二次惩罚方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视图聚类（MC）旨在利用不同视图的一致性和互补信息对样本进行分组，而子空间聚类作为MC的基础技术，需要更有效的方法来提取局部和全局结构信息。

Method: 提出了一种联合稀疏自表示学习模型，使用基数约束（ℓ0-范数）替代图拉普拉斯正则化，提取视图特定局部信息，并通过低秩约束揭示全局一致结构。开发了交替二次惩罚（AQP）方法解决非凸非光滑模型的收敛问题。

Result: 在六个标准数据集上的实验表明，该模型和AQP方法优于八种最先进算法。

Conclusion: 所提出的模型和方法在多视图聚类中表现出色，能够有效提取局部和全局结构信息，并具有全局收敛性。

Abstract: Multiview clustering (MC) aims to group samples using consistent and
complementary information across various views. The subspace clustering, as a
fundamental technique of MC, has attracted significant attention. In this
paper, we propose a novel joint sparse self-representation learning model for
MC, where a featured difference is the extraction of view-specific local
information by introducing cardinality (i.e., $\ell_0$-norm) constraints
instead of Graph-Laplacian regularization. Specifically, under each view,
cardinality constraints directly restrict the samples used in the
self-representation stage to extract reliable local and global structure
information, while the low-rank constraint aids in revealing a global coherent
structure in the consensus affinity matrix during merging. The attendant
challenge is that Augmented Lagrange Method (ALM)-based alternating
minimization algorithms cannot guarantee convergence when applied directly to
our nonconvex, nonsmooth model, thus resulting in poor generalization ability.
To address it, we develop an alternating quadratic penalty (AQP) method with
global convergence, where two subproblems are iteratively solved by closed-form
solutions. Empirical results on six standard datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our model and AQP method, compared to eight state-of-the-art
algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解因数据规模庞大而具有挑战性，现有方法因文本查询与视觉内容的多模态对齐不足而效果有限。

Method: 提出VSI方法，通过双流搜索机制（视频搜索流和字幕匹配流）整合视觉和文本信息。

Result: 在LongVideoBench上，VSI的关键帧定位准确率达到40.00%，下游视频问答任务准确率为68.48%，均显著超越基线。

Conclusion: VSI在中等至长视频问答任务中达到SOTA，证明了其稳健性和通用性。

Abstract: Long video understanding presents a significant challenge to multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) primarily due to the immense data scale. A critical and
widely adopted strategy for making this task computationally tractable is
keyframe retrieval, which seeks to identify a sparse set of video frames that
are most salient to a given textual query. However, the efficacy of this
approach is hindered by weak multimodal alignment between textual queries and
visual content and fails to capture the complex temporal semantic information
required for precise reasoning. To address this, we propose Visual-Subtitle
Integeration(VSI), a multimodal keyframe search method that integrates
subtitles, timestamps, and scene boundaries into a unified multimodal search
process. The proposed method captures the visual information of video frames as
well as the complementary textual information through a dual-stream search
mechanism by Video Search Stream as well as Subtitle Match Stream,
respectively, and improves the keyframe search accuracy through the interaction
of the two search streams. Experimental results show that VSI achieve 40.00%
key frame localization accuracy on the text-relevant subset of LongVideoBench
and 68.48% accuracy on downstream long Video-QA tasks, surpassing competitive
baselines by 20.35% and 15.79%, respectively. Furthermore, on the
LongVideoBench, VSI achieved state-of-the-art(SOTA) in medium-to-long video-QA
tasks, demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of the proposed
multimodal search strategy.

Result: 在公开数据集上显著减少误报，性能优越。

Conclusion: NS-FPN从噪声抑制角度提升性能，为红外小目标检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection and segmentation (IRSTDS) is a critical yet
challenging task in defense and civilian applications, owing to the dim,
shapeless appearance of targets and severe background clutter. Recent CNN-based
methods have achieved promising target perception results, but they only focus
on enhancing feature representation to offset the impact of noise, which
results in the increased false alarms problem. In this paper, through analyzing
the problem from the frequency domain, we pioneer in improving performance from
noise suppression perspective and propose a novel noise-suppression feature
pyramid network (NS-FPN), which integrates a low-frequency guided feature
purification (LFP) module and a spiral-aware feature sampling (SFS) module into
the original FPN structure. The LFP module suppresses the noise features by
purifying high-frequency components to achieve feature enhancement devoid of
noise interference, while the SFS module further adopts spiral sampling to fuse
target-relevant features in feature fusion process. Our NS-FPN is designed to
be lightweight yet effective and can be easily plugged into existing IRSTDS
frameworks. Extensive experiments on the public IRSTDS datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly reduces false alarms and achieves superior
performance on IRSTDS tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法仅将视觉嵌入作为上下文线索，缺乏直接视觉监督，限制了视觉嵌入的精细对齐。

Method: BASIC利用LLM浅层中精炼的视觉嵌入作为监督，从嵌入方向和语义匹配两个角度优化初始视觉嵌入。

Result: BASIC显著提升了MLLMs在多个基准测试中的性能。

Conclusion: 直接视觉监督能有效提升视觉嵌入的对齐效果，无需额外监督模型或人工标注。

Abstract: Mainstream Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve visual
understanding by using a vision projector to bridge well-pretrained vision
encoders and large language models (LLMs). The inherent gap between visual and
textual modalities makes the embeddings from the vision projector critical for
visual comprehension. However, current alignment approaches treat visual
embeddings as contextual cues and merely apply auto-regressive supervision to
textual outputs, neglecting the necessity of introducing equivalent direct
visual supervision, which hinders the potential finer alignment of visual
embeddings. In this paper, based on our analysis of the refinement process of
visual embeddings in the LLM's shallow layers, we propose BASIC, a method that
utilizes refined visual embeddings within the LLM as supervision to directly
guide the projector in generating initial visual embeddings. Specifically, the
guidance is conducted from two perspectives: (i) optimizing embedding
directions by reducing angles between initial and supervisory embeddings in
semantic space; (ii) improving semantic matching by minimizing disparities
between the logit distributions of both visual embeddings. Without additional
supervisory models or artificial annotations, BASIC significantly improves the
performance of MLLMs across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our introduced direct visual supervision.

Abstract: Chinese font generation aims to create a new Chinese font library based on

and typographers. Over the past years, with the rapid development of deep
learning algorithms, various new techniques have achieved flourishing and
thriving progress. Nevertheless, how to improve the overall quality of

background of the task. Then, we outline our literature selection and analysis
methodology, and review a series of related fundamentals, including classical
deep learning architectures, font representation formats, public datasets, and
frequently-used evaluation metrics. After that, relying on the number of
reference samples required to generate a new font, we categorize the existing
methods into two major groups: many-shot font generation and few-shot font
generation methods. Within each category, representative approaches are
summarized, and their strengths and limitations are also discussed in detail.
Finally, we conclude our paper with the challenges and future directions, with
the expectation to provide some valuable illuminations for the researchers in
this field.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短视频情感分析面临数据稀缺和多模态复杂性挑战，需高质量数据集和有效分析方法。

Result: AV-CANet在多个数据集上表现优异，并通过消融实验验证关键组件。

Conclusion: AV-CANet为短视频情感分析提供了有效解决方案，数据集和代码将开源。

Abstract: Short-form videos (SVs) have become a vital part of our online routine for
acquiring and sharing information. Their multimodal complexity poses new
challenges for video analysis, highlighting the need for video emotion analysis
(VEA) within the community. Given the limited availability of SVs emotion data,
we introduce eMotions, a large-scale dataset consisting of 27,996 videos with
full-scale annotations. To ensure quality and reduce subjective bias, we
emphasize better personnel allocation and propose a multi-stage annotation
procedure. Additionally, we provide the category-balanced and test-oriented
variants through targeted sampling to meet diverse needs. While there have been
significant studies on videos with clear emotional cues (e.g., facial
expressions), analyzing emotions in SVs remains a challenging task. The
challenge arises from the broader content diversity, which introduces more
distinct semantic gaps and complicates the representations learning of
emotion-related features. Furthermore, the prevalence of audio-visual
co-expressions in SVs leads to the local biases and collective information gaps
caused by the inconsistencies in emotional expressions. To tackle this, we
propose AV-CANet, an end-to-end audio-visual fusion network that leverages
video transformer to capture semantically relevant representations. We further
introduce the Local-Global Fusion Module designed to progressively capture the
correlations of audio-visual features. Besides, EP-CE Loss is constructed to
globally steer optimizations with tripolar penalties. Extensive experiments
across three eMotions-related datasets and four public VEA datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed AV-CANet, while providing broad insights for
future research. Moreover, we conduct ablation studies to examine the critical
components of our method. Dataset and code will be made available at Github.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的实例感知提示框架（IAPF），通过生成细粒度实例掩码，显著提升了伪装物体分割（COS）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于训练的COS方法在标注稀疏时性能下降，而训练免费方法因仅生成语义级提示导致粗糙掩码，无法有效处理多实例场景。

Method: IAPF包含三步：文本提示生成器、实例掩码生成器和自一致性投票，利用MLLM和Grounding DINO生成精细实例提示。

Result: 在标准COS基准测试中，IAPF显著优于现有训练免费方法。

Conclusion: IAPF为训练免费COS提供了一种高效解决方案，尤其在多实例场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS) remains highly challenging due to the
intrinsic visual similarity between target objects and their surroundings.
While training-based COS methods achieve good performance, their performance
degrades rapidly with increased annotation sparsity. To circumvent this
limitation, recent studies have explored training-free COS methods, leveraging
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) by automatically generating visual prompts
from a single task-generic prompt (\textit{e.g.}, "\textit{camouflaged
animal}") uniformly applied across all test images. However, these methods
typically produce only semantic-level visual prompts, causing SAM to output
coarse semantic masks and thus failing to handle scenarios with multiple
discrete camouflaged instances effectively. To address this critical
limitation, we propose a simple yet powerful \textbf{I}nstance-\textbf{A}ware
\textbf{P}rompting \textbf{F}ramework (IAPF), the first training-free COS
pipeline that explicitly converts a task-generic prompt into fine-grained
instance masks. Specifically, the IAPF comprises three steps: (1) Text Prompt
Generator, utilizing task-generic queries to prompt a Multimodal Large Language
Model (MLLM) for generating image-specific foreground and background tags; (2)
\textbf{Instance Mask Generator}, leveraging Grounding DINO to produce precise
instance-level bounding box prompts, alongside the proposed Single-Foreground
Multi-Background Prompting strategy to sample region-constrained point prompts
within each box, enabling SAM to yield a candidate instance mask; (3)
Self-consistency Instance Mask Voting, which selects the final COS prediction
by identifying the candidate mask most consistent across multiple candidate
instance masks. Extensive evaluations on standard COS benchmarks demonstrate
that the proposed IAPF significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art
training-free COS methods.

*Ruoxi Chen,Dongping Chen,Siyuan Wu,Sinan Wang,Shiyun Lang,Petr Sushko,Gaoyang Jiang,Yao Wan,Ranjay Krishna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出MultiRef-bench评估框架，研究多视觉参考图像生成任务，发现现有模型在多参考条件下表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉设计师通常从多源视觉参考中获取灵感，但现有图像生成框架主要依赖单源输入，缺乏多参考整合能力。

Method: 引入MultiRef-bench评估框架，包含990合成和1,000真实样本，并通过RefBlend数据引擎生成38k高质量图像数据集MultiRef。

Result: 实验显示，即使最先进模型（如OmniGen）在多参考条件下表现有限，合成样本准确率仅66.6%，真实样本79.0%。

Conclusion: 研究为开发更灵活、类人的多源视觉整合工具提供了方向，数据集已公开。

Abstract: Visual designers naturally draw inspiration from multiple visual references,
combining diverse elements and aesthetic principles to create artwork. However,
current image generative frameworks predominantly rely on single-source inputs
-- either text prompts or individual reference images. In this paper, we focus
on the task of controllable image generation using multiple visual references.
We introduce MultiRef-bench, a rigorous evaluation framework comprising 990
synthetic and 1,000 real-world samples that require incorporating visual
content from multiple reference images. The synthetic samples are synthetically
generated through our data engine RefBlend, with 10 reference types and 33
reference combinations. Based on RefBlend, we further construct a dataset
MultiRef containing 38k high-quality images to facilitate further research. Our
experiments across three interleaved image-text models (i.e., OmniGen, ACE, and
Show-o) and six agentic frameworks (e.g., ChatDiT and LLM + SD) reveal that
even state-of-the-art systems struggle with multi-reference conditioning, with
the best model OmniGen achieving only 66.6% in synthetic samples and 79.0% in
real-world cases on average compared to the golden answer. These findings
provide valuable directions for developing more flexible and human-like
creative tools that can effectively integrate multiple sources of visual
inspiration. The dataset is publicly available at: https://multiref.github.io/.

*Jinhao Li,Zijian Chen,Lirong Deng,Changbo Wang,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了MMReID-Bench，首个专为多模态行人重识别设计的基准测试，展示了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的潜力，但也指出其在处理某些模态（如热成像和红外数据）时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统行人重识别模型在多模态数据中泛化能力差，而现有方法未充分利用多模态大语言模型的推理和跨模态理解能力。

Method: 提出MMReID-Bench基准测试，包含20,710个多模态查询和库图像，覆盖10种行人重识别任务。

Result: 实验证明MLLMs在多模态行人重识别中表现优异，但在处理热成像和红外数据时存在局限。

Conclusion: MMReID-Bench有望推动开发更鲁棒、泛化能力更强的多模态基础模型。

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve the images of an interested
person in the gallery images, with wide applications in medical rehabilitation,
abnormal behavior detection, and public security. However, traditional person
ReID models suffer from uni-modal capability, leading to poor generalization
ability in multi-modal data, such as RGB, thermal, infrared, sketch images,
textual descriptions, etc. Recently, the emergence of multi-modal large
language models (MLLMs) shows a promising avenue for addressing this problem.
Despite this potential, existing methods merely regard MLLMs as feature
extractors or caption generators, which do not fully unleash their reasoning,
instruction-following, and cross-modal understanding capabilities. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MMReID-Bench, the first multi-task multi-modal benchmark
specifically designed for person ReID. The MMReID-Bench includes 20,710
multi-modal queries and gallery images covering 10 different person ReID tasks.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable capabilities of MLLMs in
delivering effective and versatile person ReID. Nevertheless, they also have
limitations in handling a few modalities, particularly thermal and infrared
data. We hope MMReID-Bench can facilitate the community to develop more robust
and generalizable multimodal foundation models for person ReID.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Talk2Image是一个多代理系统，用于多轮对话场景中的交互式图像生成和编辑，解决了单代理系统的意图漂移和不连贯编辑问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成任务多关注单轮场景，难以处理多轮创意任务，且单代理系统易导致意图漂移和不连贯编辑。

Method: Talk2Image整合了三个关键组件：从对话历史中解析意图、任务分解与专业代理协作执行、基于多视角评估机制的反馈驱动优化。

Result: 实验表明，Talk2Image在可控性、连贯性和用户满意度上优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Talk2Image通过多代理协作和反馈机制，实现了用户意图的逐步对齐和一致的图像编辑。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation tasks have driven remarkable advances in diverse
media applications, yet most focus on single-turn scenarios and struggle with
iterative, multi-turn creative tasks. Recent dialogue-based systems attempt to
bridge this gap, but their single-agent, sequential paradigm often causes
intention drift and incoherent edits. To address these limitations, we present
Talk2Image, a novel multi-agent system for interactive image generation and
editing in multi-turn dialogue scenarios. Our approach integrates three key
components: intention parsing from dialogue history, task decomposition and
collaborative execution across specialized agents, and feedback-driven
refinement based on a multi-view evaluation mechanism. Talk2Image enables
step-by-step alignment with user intention and consistent image editing.
Experiments demonstrate that Talk2Image outperforms existing baselines in
controllability, coherence, and user satisfaction across iterative image
generation and editing tasks.

TL;DR: AR-GRPO通过在线强化学习优化自回归图像生成模型，显著提升图像质量和人类偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受强化学习在大语言模型中的成功启发，研究如何将其应用于自回归图像生成模型以提升生成质量。

Method: 采用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)算法，设计多维度奖励函数评估生成图像的质量。

Result: 在类和文本条件图像生成任务中，RL增强框架显著优于标准自回归基线。

Conclusion: 证实了基于RL的优化在自回归图像生成中的可行性，为高质量可控图像合成开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning (RL) in refining large
language models (LLMs), we propose AR-GRPO, an approach to integrate online RL
training into autoregressive (AR) image generation models. We adapt the Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to refine the vanilla
autoregressive models' outputs by carefully designed reward functions that
evaluate generated images across multiple quality dimensions, including
perceptual quality, realism, and semantic fidelity. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on both class-conditional (i.e., class-to-image) and
text-conditional (i.e., text-to-image) image generation tasks, demonstrating
that our RL-enhanced framework significantly improves both the image quality
and human preference of generated images compared to the standard AR baselines.
Our results show consistent improvements across various evaluation metrics,
establishing the viability of RL-based optimization for AR image generation and
opening new avenues for controllable and high-quality image synthesis. The

*Weiyan Xie,Han Gao,Didan Deng,Kaican Li,April Hua Liu,Yongxiang Huang,Nevin L. Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CannyEdit是一种无需训练的文本到图像编辑框架，通过选择性Canny控制和双提示引导，解决了现有方法在文本遵从性、上下文保真度和编辑无缝性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在区域图像编辑中难以平衡文本遵从性、上下文保真度和编辑的无缝性，因此需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: CannyEdit采用选择性Canny控制（保留未编辑区域的细节）和双提示引导（结合局部和全局提示），实现精确且连贯的编辑。

Result: CannyEdit在真实图像编辑任务中表现优于现有方法，文本遵从性和上下文保真度提升了2.93%至10.49%，且编辑结果更自然。

Conclusion: CannyEdit通过创新技术显著提升了区域图像编辑的效果，为无需训练的文本到图像编辑提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models have enabled training-free
regional image editing by leveraging the generative priors of foundation
models. However, existing methods struggle to balance text adherence in edited
regions, context fidelity in unedited areas, and seamless integration of edits.
We introduce CannyEdit, a novel training-free framework that addresses these
challenges through two key innovations: (1) Selective Canny Control, which
masks the structural guidance of Canny ControlNet in user-specified editable
regions while strictly preserving details of the source images in unedited
areas via inversion-phase ControlNet information retention. This enables
precise, text-driven edits without compromising contextual integrity. (2)
Dual-Prompt Guidance, which combines local prompts for object-specific edits
with a global target prompt to maintain coherent scene interactions. On
real-world image editing tasks (addition, replacement, removal), CannyEdit
outperforms prior methods like KV-Edit, achieving a 2.93 to 10.49 percent
improvement in the balance of text adherence and context fidelity. In terms of
editing seamlessness, user studies reveal only 49.2 percent of general users
and 42.0 percent of AIGC experts identified CannyEdit's results as AI-edited
when paired with real images without edits, versus 76.08 to 89.09 percent for
competitor methods.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了首个手语生成挑战赛，旨在通过标准化评估指标比较不同系统的性能，并展示了获胜方法及其结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏标准化的评估指标，手语生成领域的系统难以进行有效比较，因此设计了这一挑战赛。

Method: 挑战赛使用RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T数据集，评估从文本到骨架姿势（T2P）的翻译架构，并引入隐藏测试集。

Result: 33名参与者提交了231个解决方案，最佳团队的BLEU-1得分为31.40，DTW-MJE为0.0574。

Conclusion: 挑战赛为手语生成领域提供了标准化评估网络，为未来研究提供了基准。

Abstract: Sign Language Production (SLP) is the task of generating sign language video
from spoken language inputs. The field has seen a range of innovations over the
last few years, with the introduction of deep learning-based approaches
providing significant improvements in the realism and naturalness of generated
outputs. However, the lack of standardized evaluation metrics for SLP
approaches hampers meaningful comparisons across different systems. To address
this, we introduce the first Sign Language Production Challenge, held as part
of the third SLRTP Workshop at CVPR 2025. The competition's aims are to
evaluate architectures that translate from spoken language sentences to a
sequence of skeleton poses, known as Text-to-Pose (T2P) translation, over a
range of metrics. For our evaluation data, we use the
RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T dataset, a German Sign Language - Deutsche
Gebardensprache (DGS) weather broadcast dataset. In addition, we curate a
custom hidden test set from a similar domain of discourse. This paper presents
the challenge design and the winning methodologies. The challenge attracted 33
participants who submitted 231 solutions, with the top-performing team
achieving BLEU-1 scores of 31.40 and DTW-MJE of 0.0574. The winning approach
utilized a retrieval-based framework and a pre-trained language model. As part
of the workshop, we release a standardized evaluation network, including
high-quality skeleton extraction-based keypoints establishing a consistent
baseline for the SLP field, which will enable future researchers to compare
their work against a broader range of methods.

### [151] [Beyond Frequency: Seeing Subtle Cues Through the Lens of Spatial Decomposition for Fine-Grained Visual Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06959)
*Qin Xu,Lili Zhu,Xiaoxia Cheng,Bo Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SCOPE的新方法，通过动态增强空间域中的细节和语义特征，解决了频率域方法在细粒度视觉分类中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有频率域方法基于固定基函数，缺乏对图像内容的适应性和动态调整能力，无法满足不同图像的判别需求。

Method: SCOPE包含两个模块：Subtle Detail Extractor（SDE）动态增强浅层特征中的细节，Salient Semantic Refiner（SSR）从高层特征中学习语义一致的细化特征。两者级联结合局部细节与全局语义。

Result: 在四个流行的细粒度图像分类基准测试中取得了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: SCOPE通过动态增强多尺度特征，突破了频率域方法的限制，显著提升了细粒度分类的灵活性。

Abstract: The crux of resolving fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) lies in
capturing discriminative and class-specific cues that correspond to subtle
visual characteristics. Recently, frequency decomposition/transform based
approaches have attracted considerable interests since its appearing
discriminative cue mining ability. However, the frequency-domain methods are
based on fixed basis functions, lacking adaptability to image content and
unable to dynamically adjust feature extraction according to the discriminative
requirements of different images. To address this, we propose a novel method
for FGVC, named Subtle-Cue Oriented Perception Engine (SCOPE), which adaptively
enhances the representational capability of low-level details and high-level
semantics in the spatial domain, breaking through the limitations of fixed
scales in the frequency domain and improving the flexibility of multi-scale
fusion. The core of SCOPE lies in two modules: the Subtle Detail Extractor
(SDE), which dynamically enhances subtle details such as edges and textures
from shallow features, and the Salient Semantic Refiner (SSR), which learns
semantically coherent and structure-aware refinement features from the
high-level features guided by the enhanced shallow features. The SDE and SSR
are cascaded stage-by-stage to progressively combine local details with global
semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new
state-of-the-art on four popular fine-grained image classification benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个针对文本到视频检索（T2VR）的攻击方法ViPro，旨在通过对抗性攻击提升视频排名，并提出了模态细化（MoRe）以增强黑盒迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2VR攻击主要关注降低视频排名，而提升视频排名的攻击未被充分研究，这种攻击可能带来更大的经济利益和（错误）信息传播风险。

Method: 提出ViPro攻击方法，通过对抗性攻击提升视频排名；引入MoRe技术，捕捉视觉与文本模态间更精细的交互以增强黑盒迁移性。

Result: ViPro在白盒、灰盒和黑盒设置下分别超越基线方法30%、10%和4%，并在多目标场景下验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: ViPro揭示了T2VR系统被忽视的漏洞，提供了攻击的上下界分析，并为潜在防御措施提供了参考。

Abstract: Thanks to the development of cross-modal models, text-to-video retrieval
(T2VR) is advancing rapidly, but its robustness remains largely unexamined.
Existing attacks against T2VR are designed to push videos away from queries,
i.e., suppressing the ranks of videos, while the attacks that pull videos
towards selected queries, i.e., promoting the ranks of videos, remain largely
unexplored. These attacks can be more impactful as attackers may gain more
views/clicks for financial benefits and widespread (mis)information. To this
end, we pioneer the first attack against T2VR to promote videos adversarially,
dubbed the Video Promotion attack (ViPro). We further propose Modal Refinement
(MoRe) to capture the finer-grained, intricate interaction between visual and
textual modalities to enhance black-box transferability. Comprehensive
experiments cover 2 existing baselines, 3 leading T2VR models, 3 prevailing
datasets with over 10k videos, evaluated under 3 scenarios. All experiments are
conducted in a multi-target setting to reflect realistic scenarios where
attackers seek to promote the video regarding multiple queries simultaneously.
We also evaluated our attacks for defences and imperceptibility. Overall, ViPro
surpasses other baselines by over $30/10/4\%$ for white/grey/black-box settings
on average. Our work highlights an overlooked vulnerability, provides a
qualitative analysis on the upper/lower bound of our attacks, and offers
insights into potential counterplays. Code will be publicly available at
https://github.com/michaeltian108/ViPro.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 首次评估了鱼眼镜头下的3D高斯泼溅方法Fisheye-GS和3DGUT，分析了它们在超过180度视场下的表现，并提出了一种基于深度的初始化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究鱼眼镜头在极端畸变下的3D重建性能，解决传统SfM初始化在强畸变下失效的问题。

Method: 通过不同视场（200度、160度、120度）评估Fisheye-GS和3DGUT的性能，并提出基于UniK3D预测的深度初始化策略。

Result: Fisheye-GS在160度视场下表现最佳，而3DGUT在200度下仍保持高质量；UniK3D策略在困难场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: 鱼眼镜头下的3D高斯泼溅方法适用于稀疏且畸变严重的图像输入，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We present the first evaluation of fisheye-based 3D Gaussian Splatting
methods, Fisheye-GS and 3DGUT, on real images with fields of view exceeding 180
degree. Our study covers both indoor and outdoor scenes captured with 200
degree fisheye cameras and analyzes how each method handles extreme distortion
in real world settings. We evaluate performance under varying fields of view
(200 degree, 160 degree, and 120 degree) to study the tradeoff between
peripheral distortion and spatial coverage. Fisheye-GS benefits from field of
view (FoV) reduction, particularly at 160 degree, while 3DGUT remains stable
across all settings and maintains high perceptual quality at the full 200
degree view. To address the limitations of SfM-based initialization, which
often fails under strong distortion, we also propose a depth-based strategy
using UniK3D predictions from only 2-3 fisheye images per scene. Although
UniK3D is not trained on real fisheye data, it produces dense point clouds that
enable reconstruction quality on par with SfM, even in difficult scenes with
fog, glare, or sky. Our results highlight the practical viability of
fisheye-based 3DGS methods for wide-angle 3D reconstruction from sparse and
distortion-heavy image inputs.

Conclusion: WeatherDiffusion在复杂天气和光照条件下表现出色，为自动驾驶场景提供了高效的正向和逆向渲染解决方案。

Abstract: Forward and inverse rendering have emerged as key techniques for enabling
understanding and reconstruction in the context of autonomous driving (AD).
However, complex weather and illumination pose great challenges to this task.
The emergence of large diffusion models has shown promise in achieving
reasonable results through learning from 2D priors, but these models are
difficult to control and lack robustness. In this paper, we introduce
WeatherDiffusion, a diffusion-based framework for forward and inverse rendering
on AD scenes with various weather and lighting conditions. Our method enables
authentic estimation of material properties, scene geometry, and lighting, and
further supports controllable weather and illumination editing through the use
of predicted intrinsic maps guided by text descriptions. We observe that
different intrinsic maps should correspond to different regions of the original
image. Based on this observation, we propose Intrinsic map-aware attention
(MAA) to enable high-quality inverse rendering. Additionally, we introduce a
synthetic dataset (\ie WeatherSynthetic) and a real-world dataset (\ie
WeatherReal) for forward and inverse rendering on AD scenes with diverse
weather and lighting. Extensive experiments show that our WeatherDiffusion
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks. Moreover, our
method demonstrates significant value in downstream tasks for AD, enhancing the
robustness of object detection and image segmentation in challenging weather
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理复杂文档结构和高变形时效果不佳，作者认为去扭曲是一个渐进过程而非一步变换。

Method: 将任务重新建模为动态过程，设计TADoc框架，并提出DLS评估指标。

Result: 实验表明TADoc在多种文档类型和变形程度下表现优越。

Conclusion: 动态建模和TADoc框架显著提升了文档去扭曲的效果，DLS指标补充了现有评估的不足。

Abstract: Flattening curved, wrinkled, and rotated document images captured by portable
photographing devices, termed document image dewarping, has become an
increasingly important task with the rise of digital economy and online
working. Although many methods have been proposed recently, they often struggle
to achieve satisfactory results when confronted with intricate document
structures and higher degrees of deformation in real-world scenarios. Our main
insight is that, unlike other document restoration tasks (e.g., deblurring),
dewarping in real physical scenes is a progressive motion rather than a
one-step transformation. Based on this, we have undertaken two key initiatives.
Firstly, we reformulate this task, modeling it for the first time as a dynamic
process that encompasses a series of intermediate states. Secondly, we design a
lightweight framework called TADoc (Time-Aware Document Dewarping Network) to
address the geometric distortion of document images. In addition, due to the
inadequacy of OCR metrics for document images containing sparse text, the
comprehensiveness of evaluation is insufficient. To address this shortcoming,
we propose a new metric -- DLS (Document Layout Similarity) -- to evaluate the
effectiveness of document dewarping in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments
and in-depth evaluations have been conducted and the results indicate that our
model possesses strong robustness, achieving superiority on several benchmarks
with different document types and degrees of distortion.

TL;DR: OctreeNCA提出了一种基于八叉树数据结构的改进NCA模型，用于高效分割高分辨率医学图像和视频，显著降低VRAM消耗并提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割需要处理大尺寸输入，传统方法如UNet或Vision Transformers在VRAM消耗和全局一致性上表现不佳。

Method: 通过八叉树数据结构扩展NCA的邻域定义，实现全局知识的高效传递，并开发CUDA实现的NCA推理函数。

Result: OctreeNCA在评估时VRAM消耗比UNet少90%，能一次性分割184兆像素病理切片或1分钟手术视频。

Conclusion: OctreeNCA为高分辨率医学图像和视频分割提供了一种高效、低资源消耗的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical applications demand segmentation of large inputs, like prostate MRIs,
pathology slices, or videos of surgery. These inputs should ideally be inferred
at once to provide the model with proper spatial or temporal context. When
segmenting large inputs, the VRAM consumption of the GPU becomes the
bottleneck. Architectures like UNets or Vision Transformers scale very poorly
in VRAM consumption, resulting in patch- or frame-wise approaches that
compromise global consistency and inference speed. The lightweight Neural
Cellular Automaton (NCA) is a bio-inspired model that is by construction
size-invariant. However, due to its local-only communication rules, it lacks
global knowledge. We propose OctreeNCA by generalizing the neighborhood
definition using an octree data structure. Our generalized neighborhood
definition enables the efficient traversal of global knowledge. Since deep
learning frameworks are mainly developed for large multi-layer networks, their
implementation does not fully leverage the advantages of NCAs. We implement an
NCA inference function in CUDA that further reduces VRAM demands and increases
inference speed. Our OctreeNCA segments high-resolution images and videos
quickly while occupying 90% less VRAM than a UNet during evaluation. This
allows us to segment 184 Megapixel pathology slices or 1-minute surgical videos
at once.

Motivation: 解决现有自监督图像分割模型的多阶段预训练耗时问题及其不连续优化导致的次优解。

Method: 提出UniAP算法快速生成多粒度伪掩码，并设计S2-UniSeg模型结合QuerySD任务进行连续预训练。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著超越现有SOTA模型，如COCO上AP+6.9，UVO上AR+11.1。

Conclusion: S2-UniSeg通过高效伪掩码生成和连续预训练，实现了自监督分割的显著性能提升和可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent self-supervised image segmentation models have achieved promising
performance on semantic segmentation and class-agnostic instance segmentation.
However, their pretraining schedule is multi-stage, requiring a time-consuming
pseudo-masks generation process between each training epoch. This
time-consuming offline process not only makes it difficult to scale with
training dataset size, but also leads to sub-optimal solutions due to its
discontinuous optimization routine. To solve these, we first present a novel
pseudo-mask algorithm, Fast Universal Agglomerative Pooling (UniAP). Each layer
of UniAP can identify groups of similar nodes in parallel, allowing to generate
both semantic-level and instance-level and multi-granular pseudo-masks within
ens of milliseconds for one image. Based on the fast UniAP, we propose the
Scalable Self-Supervised Universal Segmentation (S2-UniSeg), which employs a
student and a momentum teacher for continuous pretraining. A novel
segmentation-oriented pretext task, Query-wise Self-Distillation (QuerySD), is
proposed to pretrain S2-UniSeg to learn the local-to-global correspondences.
Under the same setting, S2-UniSeg outperforms the SOTA UnSAM model, achieving
notable improvements of AP+6.9 on COCO, AR+11.1 on UVO, PixelAcc+4.5 on
COCOStuff-27, RQ+8.0 on Cityscapes. After scaling up to a larger 2M-image
subset of SA-1B, S2-UniSeg further achieves performance gains on all four
benchmarks. Our code and pretrained models are available at

Conclusion: HiMat为高效生成高质量SVBRDF贴图提供了一种轻量级解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Creating highly detailed SVBRDFs is essential for 3D content creation. The
rise of high-resolution text-to-image generative models, based on diffusion
transformers (DiT), suggests an opportunity to finetune them for this task.
However, retargeting the models to produce multiple aligned SVBRDF maps instead
of just RGB images, while achieving high efficiency and ensuring consistency
across different maps, remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce HiMat:
a memory- and computation-efficient diffusion-based framework capable of
generating native 4K-resolution SVBRDFs. A key challenge we address is
maintaining consistency across different maps in a lightweight manner, without
relying on training new VAEs or significantly altering the DiT backbone (which
would damage its prior capabilities). To tackle this, we introduce the
CrossStitch module, a lightweight convolutional module that captures inter-map
dependencies through localized operations. Its weights are initialized such
that the DiT backbone operation is unchanged before finetuning starts. HiMat
enables generation with strong structural coherence and high-frequency details.
Results with a large set of text prompts demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach for 4K SVBRDF generation. Further experiments suggest generalization
to tasks such as intrinsic decomposition.

Conclusion: TerraMAE为高光谱图像分析提供了一种高效的表示学习方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Hyperspectral satellite imagery offers sub-30 m views of Earth in hundreds of
contiguous spectral bands, enabling fine-grained mapping of soils, crops, and
land cover. While self-supervised Masked Autoencoders excel on RGB and low-band
multispectral data, they struggle to exploit the intricate spatial-spectral
correlations in 200+ band hyperspectral images. We introduce TerraMAE, a novel
HSI encoding framework specifically designed to learn highly representative
spatial-spectral embeddings for diverse geospatial analyses. TerraMAE features
an adaptive channel grouping strategy, based on statistical reflectance
properties to capture spectral similarities, and an enhanced reconstruction
loss function that incorporates spatial and spectral quality metrics. We
demonstrate TerraMAE's effectiveness through superior spatial-spectral
information preservation in high-fidelity image reconstruction. Furthermore, we
validate its practical utility and the quality of its learned representations
through strong performance on three key downstream geospatial tasks: crop
identification, land cover classification, and soil texture prediction.

Abstract: Complex Visual Question Answering (Complex VQA) tasks, which demand
sophisticated multi-modal reasoning and external knowledge integration, present
significant challenges for existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) often
limited by their reliance on high-level global features. To address this, we
propose MV-CoRe (Multimodal Visual-Conceptual Reasoning), a novel model

object detection characteristics and scene graph representations. An innovative
Multimodal Fusion Transformer then processes and deeply integrates these
diverse feature sets, enabling rich cross-modal attention and facilitating
complex reasoning. We evaluate MV-CoRe on challenging Complex VQA benchmarks,
including GQA, A-OKVQA, and OKVQA, after training on VQAv2. Our experimental
results demonstrate that MV-CoRe consistently outperforms established LVLM
baselines, achieving an overall accuracy of 77.5% on GQA. Ablation studies

Conclusion: FOCUS-Med展示了其在AI辅助结肠镜检查中的有效性和临床潜力。

Abstract: Accurate endoscopic image segmentation on the polyps is critical for early
colorectal cancer detection. However, this task remains challenging due to low
contrast with surrounding mucosa, specular highlights, and indistinct
boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose FOCUS-Med, which stands for
Fusion of spatial and structural graph with attentional context-aware polyp
segmentation in endoscopic medical imaging. FOCUS-Med integrates a Dual Graph
Convolutional Network (Dual-GCN) module to capture contextual spatial and
topological structural dependencies. This graph-based representation enables
the model to better distinguish polyps from background tissues by leveraging
topological cues and spatial connectivity, which are often obscured in raw
image intensities. It enhances the model's ability to preserve boundaries and
delineate complex shapes typical of polyps. In addition, a location-fused
stand-alone self-attention is employed to strengthen global context
integration. To bridge the semantic gap between encoder-decoder layers, we
incorporate a trainable weighted fast normalized fusion strategy for efficient
multi-scale aggregation. Notably, we are the first to introduce the use of a
Large Language Model (LLM) to provide detailed qualitative evaluations of
segmentation quality. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate
that FOCUS-Med achieves state-of-the-art performance across five key metrics,
underscoring its effectiveness and clinical potential for AI-assisted
colonoscopy.

Motivation: 现有3D表示（如点云、网格和3D高斯）在渲染质量、表面定义和压缩性方面存在不足，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出Textured Surfel Octree (TeSO)，将3D场景表示为八叉树组织的立方体边界曲面，每个曲面关联一个纹理贴图，并通过压缩方案高效编码几何和纹理。

Result: TeSO在较低比特率下实现了比点云和3D高斯基线更高的渲染质量。

Conclusion: TeSO是一种高效的3D表示方法，适用于3D流媒体和AR/VR应用。

Abstract: 3D visual content streaming is a key technology for emerging 3D telepresence
and AR/VR applications. One fundamental element underlying the technology is a
versatile 3D representation that is capable of producing high-quality renders
and can be efficiently compressed at the same time. Existing 3D representations
like point clouds, meshes and 3D Gaussians each have limitations in terms of
rendering quality, surface definition, and compressibility. In this paper, we
present the Textured Surfel Octree (TeSO), a novel 3D representation that is
built from point clouds but addresses the aforementioned limitations. It
represents a 3D scene as cube-bounded surfels organized on an octree, where
each surfel is further associated with a texture patch. By approximating a
smooth surface with a large surfel at a coarser level of the octree, it reduces
the number of primitives required to represent the 3D scene, and yet retains
the high-frequency texture details through the texture map attached to each
surfel. We further propose a compression scheme to encode the geometry and
texture efficiently, leveraging the octree structure. The proposed textured
surfel octree combined with the compression scheme achieves higher rendering
quality at lower bit-rates compared to multiple point cloud and 3D
Gaussian-based baselines.

Conclusion: ForeSight通过无跟踪模型实现高效扩展，显著提升性能。

Abstract: We introduce ForeSight, a novel joint detection and forecasting framework for
vision-based 3D perception in autonomous vehicles. Traditional approaches treat
detection and forecasting as separate sequential tasks, limiting their ability
to leverage temporal cues. ForeSight addresses this limitation with a
multi-task streaming and bidirectional learning approach, allowing detection
and forecasting to share query memory and propagate information seamlessly. The
forecast-aware detection transformer enhances spatial reasoning by integrating
trajectory predictions from a multiple hypothesis forecast memory queue, while
the streaming forecast transformer improves temporal consistency using past
forecasts and refined detections. Unlike tracking-based methods, ForeSight
eliminates the need for explicit object association, reducing error propagation
with a tracking-free model that efficiently scales across multi-frame
sequences. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that ForeSight achieves
state-of-the-art performance, achieving an EPA of 54.9%, surpassing previous
methods by 9.3%, while also attaining the best mAP and minADE among multi-view
detection and forecasting models.

Result: 在DAIR-V2X和OPV2V数据集上，HyComm显著优于现有方法，通信量降低2006倍以上，AP50性能仍优于Where2comm。

Conclusion: HyComm通过自适应消息选择和标准化格式，实现了高效的性能-带宽权衡，适用于不同代理配置。

Abstract: Collaborative 3D detection can substantially boost detection performance by
allowing agents to exchange complementary information. It inherently results in
a fundamental trade-off between detection performance and communication
bandwidth. To tackle this bottleneck issue, we propose a novel hybrid
collaboration that adaptively integrates two types of communication messages:
perceptual outputs, which are compact, and raw observations, which offer richer
information. This approach focuses on two key aspects: i) integrating
complementary information from two message types and ii) prioritizing the most
critical data within each type. By adaptively selecting the most critical set
of messages, it ensures optimal perceptual information and adaptability,
effectively meeting the demands of diverse communication scenarios.Building on
this hybrid collaboration, we present \texttt{HyComm}, a
communication-efficient LiDAR-based collaborative 3D detection system.
\texttt{HyComm} boasts two main benefits: i) it facilitates adaptable
compression rates for messages, addressing various communication requirements,
and ii) it uses standardized data formats for messages. This ensures they are
independent of specific detection models, fostering adaptability across
different agent configurations. To evaluate HyComm, we conduct experiments on
both real-world and simulation datasets: DAIR-V2X and OPV2V. HyComm
consistently outperforms previous methods and achieves a superior
performance-bandwidth trade-off regardless of whether agents use the same or
varied detection models. It achieves a lower communication volume of more than
2,006$\times$ and still outperforms Where2comm on DAIR-V2X in terms of AP50.
The related code will be released.

Conclusion: AugLift通过稀疏增强输入提供鲁棒的帧级上下文，显著提升基于提升的姿态估计模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Lifting-based methods for 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE), which predict 3D
poses from detected 2D keypoints, often generalize poorly to new datasets and
real-world settings. To address this, we propose \emph{AugLift}, a simple yet
effective reformulation of the standard lifting pipeline that significantly
improves generalization performance without requiring additional data
collection or sensors. AugLift sparsely enriches the standard input -- the 2D
keypoint coordinates $(x, y)$ -- by augmenting it with a keypoint detection
confidence score $c$ and a corresponding depth estimate $d$. These additional
signals are computed from the image using off-the-shelf, pre-trained models
(e.g., for monocular depth estimation), thereby inheriting their strong
generalization capabilities. Importantly, AugLift serves as a modular add-on
and can be readily integrated into existing lifting architectures.
  Our extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate that AugLift
boosts cross-dataset performance on unseen datasets by an average of $10.1\%$,
while also improving in-distribution performance by $4.0\%$. These gains are
consistent across various lifting architectures, highlighting the robustness of
our method. Our analysis suggests that these sparse, keypoint-aligned cues
provide robust frame-level context, offering a practical way to significantly
improve the generalization of any lifting-based pose estimation model. Code
will be made publicly available.

Result: DMs生成的图像更真实，而GANs在特定条件下（如ECS缺失）更准确。

Conclusion: GANs和DMs各有优势，需进一步改进以可靠地增强AI诊断系统的训练数据。

Abstract: Generative image models have achieved remarkable progress in both natural and
medical imaging. In the medical context, these techniques offer a potential
solution to data scarcity-especially for low-prevalence anomalies that impair
the performance of AI-driven diagnostic and segmentation tools. However,
questions remain regarding the fidelity and clinical utility of synthetic
images, since poor generation quality can undermine model generalizability and
trust. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art
generative models-Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models
(DMs)-for synthesizing chest X-rays conditioned on four abnormalities:
Atelectasis (AT), Lung Opacity (LO), Pleural Effusion (PE), and Enlarged
Cardiac Silhouette (ECS). Using a benchmark composed of real images from the
MIMIC-CXR dataset and synthetic images from both GANs and DMs, we conducted a
reader study with three radiologists of varied experience. Participants were
asked to distinguish real from synthetic images and assess the consistency
between visual features and the target abnormality. Our results show that while
DMs generate more visually realistic images overall, GANs can report better
accuracy for specific conditions, such as absence of ECS. We further identify
visual cues radiologists use to detect synthetic images, offering insights into
the perceptual gaps in current models. These findings underscore the
complementary strengths of GANs and DMs and point to the need for further
refinement to ensure generative models can reliably augment training datasets
for AI diagnostic systems.

Conclusion: CMAMRNet通过创新的掩码引导和多尺度特征提取，显著提升了壁画修复的质量和真实性。

Abstract: Murals, as invaluable cultural artifacts, face continuous deterioration from
environmental factors and human activities. Digital restoration of murals faces
unique challenges due to their complex degradation patterns and the critical
need to preserve artistic authenticity. Existing learning-based methods
struggle with maintaining consistent mask guidance throughout their networks,
leading to insufficient focus on damaged regions and compromised restoration
quality. We propose CMAMRNet, a Contextual Mask-Aware Mural Restoration Network
that addresses these limitations through comprehensive mask guidance and
multi-scale feature extraction. Our framework introduces two key components:
(1) the Mask-Aware Up/Down-Sampler (MAUDS), which ensures consistent mask
sensitivity across resolution scales through dedicated channel-wise feature
selection and mask-guided feature fusion; and (2) the Co-Feature Aggregator
(CFA), operating at both the highest and lowest resolutions to extract
complementary features for capturing fine textures and global structures in
degraded regions. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
CMAMRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively preserving both
structural integrity and artistic details in restored murals. The code is

Result: 在15个数据集上的实验表明，DPAL显著提升了轻量级HVM的泛化能力，性能接近甚至超越大型HVM。

Conclusion: DPAL通过动态模式对齐学习，成功实现了轻量级HVM的高效训练和强大泛化。

Abstract: Human-centric vision models (HVMs) have achieved remarkable generalization
due to large-scale pretraining on massive person images. However, their
dependence on large neural architectures and the restricted accessibility of
pretraining data significantly limits their practicality in real-world
applications. To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Pattern Alignment
Learning (DPAL), a novel distillation-based pretraining framework that
efficiently trains lightweight HVMs to acquire strong generalization from large
HVMs. In particular, human-centric visual perception are highly dependent on
three typical visual patterns, including global identity pattern, local shape
pattern and multi-person interaction pattern. To achieve generalizable
lightweight HVMs, we firstly design a dynamic pattern decoder (D-PaDe), acting
as a dynamic Mixture of Expert (MoE) model. It incorporates three specialized
experts dedicated to adaptively extract typical visual patterns, conditioned on
both input image and pattern queries. And then, we present three levels of
alignment objectives, which aims to minimize generalization gap between
lightweight HVMs and large HVMs at global image level, local pixel level, and
instance relation level. With these two deliberate designs, the DPAL
effectively guides lightweight model to learn all typical human visual patterns
from large HVMs, which can generalize to various human-centric vision tasks.
Extensive experiments conducted on 15 challenging datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the DPAL. Remarkably, when employing PATH-B as the teacher,
DPAL-ViT/Ti (5M parameters) achieves surprising generalizability similar to
existing large HVMs such as PATH-B (84M) and Sapiens-L (307M), and outperforms
previous distillation-based pretraining methods including Proteus-ViT/Ti (5M)
and TinyMiM-ViT/Ti (5M) by a large margin.

Abstract: Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is critical for the path planning
and motion control of autonomous vehicles. Recent diffusion-based models have
shown promising results in capturing the inherent stochasticity of pedestrian
behavior for trajectory prediction. However, the absence of explicit semantic
modelling of pedestrian intent in many diffusion-based methods may result in
misinterpreted behaviors and reduced prediction accuracy. To address the above
challenges, we propose a diffusion-based pedestrian trajectory prediction
framework that incorporates both short-term and long-term motion intentions.
Short-term intent is modelled using a residual polar representation, which
decouples direction and magnitude to capture fine-grained local motion
patterns. Long-term intent is estimated through a learnable, token-based
endpoint predictor that generates multiple candidate goals with associated
probabilities, enabling multimodal and context-aware intention modelling.
Furthermore, we enhance the diffusion process by incorporating adaptive
guidance and a residual noise predictor that dynamically refines denoising
accuracy. The proposed framework is evaluated on the widely used ETH, UCY, and
SDD benchmarks, demonstrating competitive results against state-of-the-art
methods.

Result: 模型生成的草图视频既保留了原始外观，又模仿了参考视频的动态动作，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: SketchAnimator在一次性动作定制任务中表现出色，为草图动画化提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Sketching is a uniquely human tool for expressing ideas and creativity. The
animation of sketches infuses life into these static drawings, opening a new
dimension for designers. Animating sketches is a time-consuming process that
demands professional skills and extensive experience, often proving daunting
for amateurs. In this paper, we propose a novel sketch animation model
SketchAnimator, which enables adding creative motion to a given sketch, like "a
jumping car''. Namely, given an input sketch and a reference video, we divide
the sketch animation into three stages: Appearance Learning, Motion Learning
and Video Prior Distillation. In stages 1 and 2, we utilize LoRA to integrate
sketch appearance information and motion dynamics from the reference video into
the pre-trained T2V model. In the third stage, we utilize Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) to update the parameters of the Bezier curves in each sketch
frame according to the acquired motion information. Consequently, our model
produces a sketch video that not only retains the original appearance of the
sketch but also mirrors the dynamic movements of the reference video. We
compare our method with alternative approaches and demonstrate that it
generates the desired sketch video under the challenge of one-shot motion
customization.

Abstract: 3D human-object interaction (HOI) anticipation aims to predict the future
motion of humans and their manipulated objects, conditioned on the historical
context. Generally, the articulated humans and rigid objects exhibit different
motion patterns, due to their distinct intrinsic physical properties. However,
this distinction is ignored by most of the existing works, which intend to
capture the dynamics of both humans and objects within a single prediction
model. In this work, we propose a novel contact-consistent decoupled diffusion
framework CoopDiff, which employs two distinct branches to decouple human and
object motion modeling, with the human-object contact points as shared anchors
to bridge the motion generation across branches. The human dynamics branch is
aimed to predict highly structured human motion, while the object dynamics
branch focuses on the object motion with rigid translations and rotations.
These two branches are bridged by a series of shared contact points with
consistency constraint for coherent human-object motion prediction. To further
enhance human-object consistency and prediction reliability, we propose a
human-driven interaction module to guide object motion modeling. Extensive
experiments on the BEHAVE and Human-object Interaction datasets demonstrate
that our CoopDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: In the domain of computer vision, multi-scale feature extraction is vital for
tasks such as salient object detection. However, achieving this capability in
lightweight networks remains challenging due to the trade-off between
efficiency and performance. This paper proposes a novel lightweight multi-scale
feature extraction layer, termed the LMF layer, which employs depthwise
separable dilated convolutions in a fully connected structure. By integrating
multiple LMF layers, we develop LMFNet, a lightweight network tailored for
salient object detection. Our approach significantly reduces the number of
parameters while maintaining competitive performance. Here, we show that LMFNet
achieves state-of-the-art or comparable results on five benchmark datasets with
only 0.81M parameters, outperforming several traditional and lightweight models
in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. Our work not only addresses the
challenge of multi-scale learning in lightweight networks but also demonstrates
the potential for broader applications in image processing tasks. The related

TL;DR: EventRR框架将视频对象分割任务分解为对象总结和引用推理两部分，通过构建Referential Event Graph（REG）和Temporal Concept-Role Reasoning（TCRR）显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了视频引用表达式的语义结构，而EventRR通过结构化推理解决了这一复杂性。

Method: EventRR分为对象总结和引用推理两部分，总结阶段生成瓶颈令牌并聚合全局跨模态上下文，推理阶段通过REG和TCRR进行结构化推理。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，EventRR在定量和定性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EventRR通过结构化语义推理显著提升了视频对象分割的性能。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment out the object in
a video referred by an expression. Current RVOS methods view referring
expressions as unstructured sequences, neglecting their crucial semantic
structure essential for referent reasoning. Besides, in contrast to
image-referring expressions whose semantics focus only on object attributes and
object-object relations, video-referring expressions also encompass event
attributes and event-event temporal relations. This complexity challenges
traditional structured reasoning image approaches. In this paper, we propose
the Event Referential Reasoning (EventRR) framework. EventRR decouples RVOS
into object summarization part and referent reasoning part. The summarization
phase begins by summarizing each frame into a set of bottleneck tokens, which
are then efficiently aggregated in the video-level summarization step to
exchange the global cross-modal temporal context. For reasoning part, EventRR
extracts semantic eventful structure of a video-referring expression into
highly expressive Referential Event Graph (REG), which is a single-rooted
directed acyclic graph. Guided by topological traversal of REG, we propose
Temporal Concept-Role Reasoning (TCRR) to accumulate the referring score of
each temporal query from REG leaf nodes to root node. Each reasoning step can
be interpreted as a question-answer pair derived from the concept-role
relations in REG. Extensive experiments across four widely recognized benchmark
datasets, show that EventRR quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms
state-of-the-art RVOS methods. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种深度引导网络（DGN）用于图像修复，结合新的大规模高分辨率数据集，通过双分支交互提升修复质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法常忽略深度信息，导致相似性匹配不佳、注意力分散或背景过度增强。

Method: 网络包含深度估计分支和图像修复分支，利用窗口自注意力和稀疏非局部注意力捕捉对象内和对象间相似性。

Result: 在多个标准基准测试中达到最优性能，并能泛化到未见过的植物图像。

Conclusion: DGN通过深度引导和联合训练显著提升了图像修复效果，展示了方法的有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Image restoration has seen substantial progress in recent years. However,
existing methods often neglect depth information, which hurts similarity
matching, results in attention distractions in shallow depth-of-field (DoF)
scenarios, and excessive enhancement of background content in deep DoF
settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Depth-Guided
Network (DGN) for image restoration, together with a novel large-scale
high-resolution dataset. Specifically, the network consists of two interactive
branches: a depth estimation branch that provides structural guidance, and an
image restoration branch that performs the core restoration task. In addition,
the image restoration branch exploits intra-object similarity through
progressive window-based self-attention and captures inter-object similarity
via sparse non-local attention. Through joint training, depth features
contribute to improved restoration quality, while the enhanced visual features
from the restoration branch in turn help refine depth estimation. Notably, we
also introduce a new dataset for training and evaluation, consisting of 9,205
high-resolution images from 403 plant species, with diverse depth and texture
variations. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on several standard benchmarks and generalizes
well to unseen plant images, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了现有超分辨率方法的性能。

Conclusion: 通过建模真实退化轨迹和傅里叶先验，该方法有效解决了真实世界超分辨率的挑战。

Abstract: Unsupervised real-world super-resolution (SR) faces critical challenges due
to the complex, unknown degradation distributions in practical scenarios.
Existing methods struggle to generalize from synthetic low-resolution (LR) and
high-resolution (HR) image pairs to real-world data due to a significant domain
gap. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised real-world SR method based on
rectified flow to effectively capture and model real-world degradation,
synthesizing LR-HR training pairs with realistic degradation. Specifically,
given unpaired LR and HR images, we propose a novel Rectified Flow Degradation
Module (RFDM) that introduces degradation-transformed LR (DT-LR) images as
intermediaries. By modeling the degradation trajectory in a continuous and
invertible manner, RFDM better captures real-world degradation and enhances the
realism of generated LR images. Additionally, we propose a Fourier Prior Guided
Degradation Module (FGDM) that leverages structural information embedded in
Fourier phase components to ensure more precise modeling of real-world
degradation. Finally, the LR images are processed by both FGDM and RFDM,
producing final synthetic LR images with real-world degradation. The synthetic
LR images are paired with the given HR images to train the off-the-shelf SR
networks. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances the performance of existing SR approaches in
real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于认知启发的多模态边界保持网络（CMB-Net），利用大语言模型（LLMs）分析图像篡改区域，并通过图像-文本交互模块和恢复边缘解码器提升篡改定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像篡改定位（IML）模型主要依赖视觉线索，忽略了内容特征的语义逻辑关系，而篡改技术通常会破坏这些关系，留下语义线索。

Method: CMB-Net利用LLMs生成基于提示的文本信息，并通过图像-文本中心模糊模块（ITCAM）和图像-文本交互模块（ITIM）优化文本与视觉特征的融合，同时采用恢复边缘解码器（RED）保持边界信息。

Result: 实验表明，CMB-Net在性能上优于大多数现有IML模型。

Conclusion: CMB-Net通过结合语义分析和多模态交互，显著提升了篡改定位的准确性。

Abstract: The existing image manipulation localization (IML) models mainly relies on
visual cues, but ignores the semantic logical relationships between content
features. In fact, the content semantics conveyed by real images often conform
to human cognitive laws. However, image manipulation technology usually
destroys the internal relationship between content features, thus leaving
semantic clues for IML. In this paper, we propose a cognition-inspired
multimodal boundary-preserving network (CMB-Net). Specifically, CMB-Net
utilizes large language models (LLMs) to analyze manipulated regions within
images and generate prompt-based textual information to compensate for the lack
of semantic relationships in the visual information. Considering that the
erroneous texts induced by hallucination from LLMs will damage the accuracy of
IML, we propose an image-text central ambiguity module (ITCAM). It assigns
weights to the text features by quantifying the ambiguity between text and
image features, thereby ensuring the beneficial impact of textual information.
We also propose an image-text interaction module (ITIM) that aligns visual and
text features using a correlation matrix for fine-grained interaction. Finally,
inspired by invertible neural networks, we propose a restoration edge decoder
(RED) that mutually generates input and output features to preserve boundary
information in manipulated regions without loss. Extensive experiments show
that CMB-Net outperforms most existing IML models.

Method: 提出线性求解器和非线性优化解决姿态模糊问题，并引入全局优化的混合标定方法，结合通用和参数化模型的优势。

Result: 仿真和实际实验表明，混合方法在不同镜头类型和噪声污染下均表现优异。

Conclusion: 混合标定方法在复杂场景中提供了可靠且精确的相机标定解决方案。

Abstract: Offline camera calibration techniques typically employ parametric or generic
camera models. Selecting parametric models relies heavily on user experience,
and an inappropriate camera model can significantly affect calibration
accuracy. Meanwhile, generic calibration methods involve complex procedures and
cannot provide traditional intrinsic parameters. This paper reveals a pose
ambiguity in the pose solutions of generic calibration methods that
irreversibly impacts subsequent pose estimation. A linear solver and a
nonlinear optimization are proposed to address this ambiguity issue. Then a
global optimization hybrid calibration method is introduced to integrate
generic and parametric models together, which improves extrinsic parameter
accuracy of generic calibration and mitigates overfitting and numerical
instability in parametric calibration. Simulation and real-world experimental
results demonstrate that the generic-parametric hybrid calibration method
consistently excels across various lens types and noise contamination,
hopefully serving as a reliable and accurate solution for camera calibration in
complex scenarios.

Abstract: Visual speech recognition is a technique to identify spoken content in silent
speech videos, which has raised significant attention in recent years.
Advancements in data-driven deep learning methods have significantly improved
both the speed and accuracy of recognition. However, these deep learning
methods can be effected by visual disturbances, such as lightning conditions,
skin texture and other user-specific features. Data-driven approaches could
reduce the performance degradation caused by these visual disturbances using
models pretrained on large-scale datasets. But these methods often require
large amounts of training data and computational resources, making them costly.
To reduce the influence of user-specific features and enhance performance with
limited data, this paper proposed a landmark guided visual feature extractor.
Facial landmarks are used as auxiliary information to aid in training the
visual feature extractor. A spatio-temporal multi-graph convolutional network
is designed to fully exploit the spatial locations and spatio-temporal features
of facial landmarks. Additionally, a multi-level lip dynamic fusion framework
is introduced to combine the spatio-temporal features of the landmarks with the
visual features extracted from the raw video frames. Experimental results show
that this approach performs well with limited data and also improves the
model's accuracy on unseen speakers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有粗粒度分割方法在细粒度分割中表现不佳，且Mamba模型依赖固定扫描顺序，无法适应个体差异。

Method: 提出ASM-UNet，结合群体共性和个体差异生成自适应扫描分数，动态指导扫描顺序。

Result: 在ACDC、Synapse和BTMS数据集上，ASM-UNet在粗粒度和细粒度分割任务中均表现优异。

Conclusion: ASM-UNet通过动态扫描顺序解决了细粒度分割的挑战，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Precise lesion resection depends on accurately identifying fine-grained
anatomical structures. While many coarse-grained segmentation (CGS) methods
have been successful in large-scale segmentation (e.g., organs), they fall
short in clinical scenarios requiring fine-grained segmentation (FGS), which
remains challenging due to frequent individual variations in small-scale
anatomical structures. Although recent Mamba-based models have advanced medical
image segmentation, they often rely on fixed manually-defined scanning orders,
which limit their adaptability to individual variations in FGS. To address
this, we propose ASM-UNet, a novel Mamba-based architecture for FGS. It
introduces adaptive scan scores to dynamically guide the scanning order,
generated by combining group-level commonalities and individual-level
variations. Experiments on two public datasets (ACDC and Synapse) and a newly
proposed challenging biliary tract FGS dataset, namely BTMS, demonstrate that
ASM-UNet achieves superior performance in both CGS and FGS tasks. Our code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/YqunYang/ASM-UNet.

Result: 实验证明MiraMo在生成一致性、平滑性和可控性动画方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MiraMo在图像动画任务中表现出高效性和多功能性，适用于运动迁移和视频编辑。

Abstract: Image animation has seen significant progress, driven by the powerful
generative capabilities of diffusion models. However, maintaining appearance
consistency with static input images and mitigating abrupt motion transitions
in generated animations remain persistent challenges. While text-to-video (T2V)
generation has demonstrated impressive performance with diffusion transformer
models, the image animation field still largely relies on U-Net-based diffusion
models, which lag behind the latest T2V approaches. Moreover, the quadratic
complexity of vanilla self-attention mechanisms in Transformers imposes heavy
computational demands, making image animation particularly resource-intensive.
To address these issues, we propose MiraMo, a framework designed to enhance
efficiency, appearance consistency, and motion smoothness in image animation.
Specifically, MiraMo introduces three key elements: (1) A foundational
text-to-video architecture replacing vanilla self-attention with efficient
linear attention to reduce computational overhead while preserving generation
quality; (2) A novel motion residual learning paradigm that focuses on modeling
motion dynamics rather than directly predicting frames, improving temporal
consistency; and (3) A DCT-based noise refinement strategy during inference to
suppress sudden motion artifacts, complemented by a dynamics control module to
balance motion smoothness and expressiveness. Extensive experiments against
state-of-the-art methods validate the superiority of MiraMo in generating
consistent, smooth, and controllable animations with accelerated inference
speed. Additionally, we demonstrate the versatility of MiraMo through
applications in motion transfer and video editing tasks.

Result: 实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的跟踪性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效整合空间和光谱信息，显著提升了高光谱视频跟踪的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Hyperspectral videos (HSVs), with their inherent spatial-spectral-temporal
structure, offer distinct advantages in challenging tracking scenarios such as
cluttered backgrounds and small objects. However, existing methods primarily
focus on spatial interactions between the template and search regions, often
overlooking spectral interactions, leading to suboptimal performance. To
address this issue, this paper investigates spectral interactions from both the
architectural and training perspectives. At the architectural level, we first
establish band-wise long-range spatial relationships between the template and
search regions using Transformers. We then model spectral interactions using
the inclusion-exclusion principle from set theory, treating them as the union
of spatial interactions across all bands. This enables the effective
integration of both shared and band-specific spatial cues. At the training
level, we introduce a spectral loss to enforce material distribution alignment
between the template and predicted regions, enhancing robustness to shape
deformation and appearance variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our tracker achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance. The source code,
trained models and results will be publicly available via

Conclusion: EgoDynamic4D和提出的框架为动态场景理解提供了新的基准和方法。

Abstract: Understanding dynamic 4D scenes from an egocentric perspective-modeling
changes in 3D spatial structure over time-is crucial for human-machine
interaction, autonomous navigation, and embodied intelligence. While existing
egocentric datasets contain dynamic scenes, they lack unified 4D annotations
and task-driven evaluation protocols for fine-grained spatio-temporal
reasoning, especially on motion of objects and human, together with their
interactions. To address this gap, we introduce EgoDynamic4D, a novel QA
benchmark on highly dynamic scenes, comprising RGB-D video, camera poses,
globally unique instance masks, and 4D bounding boxes. We construct 927K QA
pairs accompanied by explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT), enabling verifiable,
step-by-step spatio-temporal reasoning. We design 12 dynamic QA tasks covering
agent motion, human-object interaction, trajectory prediction, relation
understanding, and temporal-causal reasoning, with fine-grained,
multidimensional metrics. To tackle these tasks, we propose an end-to-end
spatio-temporal reasoning framework that unifies dynamic and static scene
information, using instance-aware feature encoding, time and camera encoding,
and spatially adaptive down-sampling to compress large 4D scenes into token
sequences manageable by LLMs. Experiments on EgoDynamic4D show that our method
consistently outperforms baselines, validating the effectiveness of multimodal
temporal modeling for egocentric dynamic scene understanding.

Conclusion: SLC是首个训练高效的框架，能够支持开源和闭源大型VLM的个性化，为实际应用提供了更广泛的可能。

Abstract: Personalizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to transform them into daily
assistants has emerged as a trending research direction. However, leading
companies like OpenAI continue to increase model size and develop complex
designs such as the chain of thought (CoT). While large VLMs are proficient in
complex multi-modal understanding, their high training costs and limited access
via paid APIs restrict direct personalization. Conversely, small VLMs are
easily personalized and freely available, but they lack sufficient reasoning
capabilities. Inspired by this, we propose a novel collaborative framework
named Small-Large Collaboration (SLC) for large VLM personalization, where the
small VLM is responsible for generating personalized information, while the
large model integrates this personalized information to deliver accurate
responses. To effectively incorporate personalized information, we develop a
test-time reflection strategy, preventing the potential hallucination of the
small VLM. Since SLC only needs to train a meta personalized small VLM for the
large VLMs, the overall process is training-efficient. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first training-efficient framework that supports both
open-source and closed-source large VLMs, enabling broader real-world
personalized applications. We conduct thorough experiments across various
benchmarks and large VLMs to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SLC
framework. The code will be released at https://github.com/Hhankyangg/SLC.

Result: 模型能够在开放世界环境中自主获取和更新知识。

Conclusion: OpenHAIV为开放世界识别提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Substantial progress has been made in various techniques for open-world
recognition. Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods can effectively
distinguish between known and unknown classes in the data, while incremental
learning enables continuous model knowledge updates. However, in open-world
scenarios, these approaches still face limitations. Relying solely on OOD
detection does not facilitate knowledge updates in the model, and incremental
fine-tuning typically requires supervised conditions, which significantly
deviate from open-world settings. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes OpenHAIV, a novel framework that integrates OOD detection, new class
discovery, and incremental continual fine-tuning into a unified pipeline. This
framework allows models to autonomously acquire and update knowledge in
open-world environments. The proposed framework is available at

Abstract: Understanding internal feature representations of deep neural networks (DNNs)
is a fundamental step toward model interpretability. Inspired by neuroscience
methods that probe biological neurons using visual stimuli, recent deep
learning studies have employed Activation Maximization (AM) to synthesize
inputs that elicit strong responses from artificial neurons. In this work, we
propose a unified feature visualization framework applicable to both
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). Unlike
prior efforts that predominantly focus on the last output-layer neurons in
CNNs, we extend feature visualization to intermediate layers as well, offering
deeper insights into the hierarchical structure of learned feature
representations. Furthermore, we investigate how activation maximization can be
leveraged to generate adversarial examples, revealing potential vulnerabilities
and decision boundaries of DNNs. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach in both traditional CNNs and modern ViT, highlighting its

Abstract: Label scarcity remains a major challenge in deep learning-based medical image
segmentation. Recent studies use strong-weak pseudo supervision to leverage
unlabeled data. However, performance is often hindered by inconsistencies
between pseudo labels and their corresponding unlabeled images. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SynMatch}, a novel framework that sidesteps the need for
improving pseudo labels by synthesizing images to match them instead.
Specifically, SynMatch synthesizes images using texture and shape features
extracted from the same segmentation model that generates the corresponding
pseudo labels for unlabeled images. This design enables the generation of
highly consistent synthesized-image-pseudo-label pairs without requiring any
training parameters for image synthesis. We extensively evaluate SynMatch
across diverse medical image segmentation tasks under semi-supervised learning
(SSL), weakly-supervised learning (WSL), and barely-supervised learning (BSL)
settings with increasingly limited annotations. The results demonstrate that
SynMatch achieves superior performance, especially in the most challenging BSL
setting. For example, it outperforms the recent strong-weak pseudo
supervision-based method by 29.71\% and 10.05\% on the polyp segmentation task
with 5\% and 10\% scribble annotations, respectively. The code will be released
at https://github.com/Senyh/SynMatch.

Abstract: Real-time semantic segmentation presents the dual challenge of designing
efficient architectures that capture large receptive fields for semantic
understanding while also refining detailed contours. Vision transformers model
long-range dependencies effectively but incur high computational cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce the Large Kernel Attention (LKA)
mechanism. Our proposed Bilateral Efficient Visual Attention Network (BEVANet)
expands the receptive field to capture contextual information and extracts
visual and structural features using Sparse Decomposed Large Separable Kernel
Attentions (SDLSKA). The Comprehensive Kernel Selection (CKS) mechanism
dynamically adapts the receptive field to further enhance performance.
Furthermore, the Deep Large Kernel Pyramid Pooling Module (DLKPPM) enriches
contextual features by synergistically combining dilated convolutions and large
kernel attention. The bilateral architecture facilitates frequent branch
communication, and the Boundary Guided Adaptive Fusion (BGAF) module enhances
boundary delineation by integrating spatial and semantic features under
boundary guidance. BEVANet achieves real-time segmentation at 33 FPS, yielding
79.3% mIoU without pretraining and 81.0% mIoU on Cityscapes after ImageNet
pretraining, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. The code and model is

supporting digital agriculture and empowering smallholder farmers with
accessible technology. By bridging the gap between research and real-world
application, our work advances post-harvest management and promotes sustainable

Abstract: Efficient lightweight neural networks are with increasing attention due to
their faster reasoning speed and easier deployment on mobile devices. However,
existing video pre-trained models still focus on the common ViT architecture
with high latency, and few works attempt to build efficient architecture on
mobile devices. This paper bridges this gap by introducing temporal structural
reparameterization into an efficient image-text model and training it on a
large-scale high-quality video-text dataset, resulting in an efficient
video-text model that can run on mobile devices with strong zero-shot
classification and retrieval capabilities, termed as MobileViCLIP. In
particular, in terms of inference speed on mobile devices, our
MobileViCLIP-Small is 55.4x times faster than InternVideo2-L14 and 6.7x faster
than InternVideo2-S14. In terms of zero-shot retrieval performance, our
MobileViCLIP-Small obtains similar performance as InternVideo2-L14 and obtains

Result: DocR1在多页任务上达到最先进性能，同时在单页任务上保持强劲表现。

Conclusion: EviGRPO框架和数据集构建方法为多页文档理解提供了高效解决方案，DocR1展示了其优越性能。

Abstract: Understanding multi-page documents poses a significant challenge for
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as it requires fine-grained visual
comprehension and multi-hop reasoning across pages. While prior work has
explored reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing advanced reasoning in MLLMs,
its application to multi-page document understanding remains underexplored. In
this paper, we introduce DocR1, an MLLM trained with a novel RL framework,
Evidence Page-Guided GRPO (EviGRPO). EviGRPO incorporates an evidence-aware
reward mechanism that promotes a coarse-to-fine reasoning strategy, guiding the
model to first retrieve relevant pages before generating answers. This training
paradigm enables us to build high-quality models with limited supervision. To
support this, we design a two-stage annotation pipeline and a curriculum
learning strategy, based on which we construct two datasets: EviBench, a
high-quality training set with 4.8k examples, and ArxivFullQA, an evaluation
benchmark with 8.6k QA pairs based on scientific papers. Extensive experiments
across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that DocR1 achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multi-page tasks, while consistently
maintaining strong results on single-page benchmarks.

TL;DR: RORPCap提出了一种基于检索的对象和关系提示方法，用于图像描述生成，解决了传统方法中冗余检测信息、GCN构建困难和训练成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像描述生成需要准确识别对象及其关系，但现有方法存在冗余检测信息、GCN构建困难和训练成本高的问题。

Method: RORPCap通过对象和关系提取模型提取关键词，结合预定义提示模板生成提示嵌入，再通过Mamba网络将CLIP图像嵌入映射为视觉-文本嵌入，最终输入GPT-2生成描述。

Result: 在MS-COCO数据集上，RORPCap仅需2.6小时训练，CIDEr得分120.5%，SPICE得分22.0%，性能与基于检测器和GCN的模型相当。

Conclusion: RORPCap是一种高效且性能优越的图像描述生成替代方案。

Abstract: Image captioning aims to generate natural language descriptions for input
images in an open-form manner. To accurately generate descriptions related to
the image, a critical step in image captioning is to identify objects and
understand their relations within the image. Modern approaches typically
capitalize on object detectors or combine detectors with Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN). However, these models suffer from redundant detection
information, difficulty in GCN construction, and high training costs. To
address these issues, a Retrieval-based Objects and Relations Prompt for Image
Captioning (RORPCap) is proposed, inspired by the fact that image-text
retrieval can provide rich semantic information for input images. RORPCap
employs an Objects and relations Extraction Model to extract object and
relation words from the image. These words are then incorporate into predefined
prompt templates and encoded as prompt embeddings. Next, a Mamba-based mapping
network is designed to quickly map image embeddings extracted by CLIP to
visual-text embeddings. Finally, the resulting prompt embeddings and
visual-text embeddings are concatenated to form textual-enriched feature
embeddings, which are fed into a GPT-2 model for caption generation. Extensive
experiments conducted on the widely used MS-COCO dataset show that the RORPCap
requires only 2.6 hours under cross-entropy loss training, achieving 120.5%
CIDEr score and 22.0% SPICE score on the "Karpathy" test split. RORPCap
achieves comparable performance metrics to detector-based and GCN-based models
with the shortest training time and demonstrates its potential as an
alternative for image captioning.

Motivation: 解决视频语言对齐中语言复杂性、动态实体交互及语义鸿沟的挑战。

Method: Planner模块分解复杂语言提示为短句链，Refiner模块通过自注意力机制逐步优化视觉表示。

Result: 在Referring Video Object Segmentation和Temporal Grounding任务中优于现有方法，尤其在复杂提示下表现突出。

Conclusion: Planner-Refiner框架有效提升视频语言对齐性能，适用于复杂语言场景。

Abstract: Vision-language alignment in video must address the complexity of language,
evolving interacting entities, their action chains, and semantic gaps between
language and vision. This work introduces Planner-Refiner, a framework to
overcome these challenges. Planner-Refiner bridges the semantic gap by
iteratively refining visual elements' space-time representation, guided by
language until semantic gaps are minimal. A Planner module schedules language
guidance by decomposing complex linguistic prompts into short sentence chains.
The Refiner processes each short sentence, a noun-phrase and verb-phrase pair,
to direct visual tokens' self-attention across space then time, achieving
efficient single-step refinement. A recurrent system chains these steps,
maintaining refined visual token representations. The final representation
feeds into task-specific heads for alignment generation. We demonstrate
Planner-Refiner's effectiveness on two video-language alignment tasks:
Referring Video Object Segmentation and Temporal Grounding with varying
language complexity. We further introduce a new MeViS-X benchmark to assess
models' capability with long queries. Superior performance versus
state-of-the-art methods on these benchmarks shows the approach's potential,
especially for complex prompts.

Conclusion: CoAR以极少的参数调整（<0.05%）实现高性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: The unified autoregressive (AR) model excels at multimodal understanding and
generation, but its potential for customized image generation remains
underexplored. Existing customized generation methods rely on full fine-tuning
or adapters, making them costly and prone to overfitting or catastrophic
forgetting. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CoAR}, a novel framework for
injecting subject concepts into the unified AR models while keeping all
pre-trained parameters completely frozen. CoAR learns effective, specific
subject representations with only a minimal number of parameters using a
Layerwise Multimodal Context Learning strategy. To address overfitting and
language drift, we further introduce regularization that preserves the
pre-trained distribution and anchors context tokens to improve subject fidelity
and re-contextualization. Additionally, CoAR supports training-free subject
customization in a user-provided style. Experiments demonstrate that CoAR
achieves superior performance on both subject-driven personalization and style
personalization, while delivering significant gains in computational and memory
efficiency. Notably, CoAR tunes less than \textbf{0.05\%} of the parameters
while achieving competitive performance compared to recent Proxy-Tuning. Code:

Result: 实验表明SODiff在视觉质量和定量指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SODiff通过语义导向和自适应去噪策略，显著提升了JPEG伪影去除效果。

Abstract: JPEG, as a widely used image compression standard, often introduces severe
visual artifacts when achieving high compression ratios. Although existing deep
learning-based restoration methods have made considerable progress, they often
struggle to recover complex texture details, resulting in over-smoothed
outputs. To overcome these limitations, we propose SODiff, a novel and
efficient semantic-oriented one-step diffusion model for JPEG artifacts
removal. Our core idea is that effective restoration hinges on providing
semantic-oriented guidance to the pre-trained diffusion model, thereby fully
leveraging its powerful generative prior. To this end, SODiff incorporates a
semantic-aligned image prompt extractor (SAIPE). SAIPE extracts rich features
from low-quality (LQ) images and projects them into an embedding space
semantically aligned with that of the text encoder. Simultaneously, it
preserves crucial information for faithful reconstruction. Furthermore, we
propose a quality factor-aware time predictor that implicitly learns the
compression quality factor (QF) of the LQ image and adaptively selects the
optimal denoising start timestep for the diffusion process. Extensive
experimental results show that our SODiff outperforms recent leading methods in
both visual quality and quantitative metrics. Code is available at:

Result: 重建完整性提升20.5%，几何精度提升32.8%，高斯基元减少71.8%。

Conclusion: 语义建筑模型集成可推动高斯泼溅在智慧城市等实际应用中的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting (GS) have demonstrated its
effectiveness in photo-realistic rendering and 3D reconstruction. Among these,
2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) is particularly suitable for surface
reconstruction due to its flattened Gaussian representation and integrated
normal regularization. However, its performance often degrades in large-scale
and complex urban scenes with frequent occlusions, leading to incomplete
building reconstructions. We propose GS4Buildings, a novel prior-guided
Gaussian Splatting method leveraging the ubiquity of semantic 3D building
models for robust and scalable building surface reconstruction. Instead of
relying on traditional Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines, GS4Buildings
initializes Gaussians directly from low-level Level of Detail (LoD)2 semantic
3D building models. Moreover, we generate prior depth and normal maps from the
planar building geometry and incorporate them into the optimization process,
providing strong geometric guidance for surface consistency and structural
accuracy. We also introduce an optional building-focused mode that limits
reconstruction to building regions, achieving a 71.8% reduction in Gaussian
primitives and enabling a more efficient and compact representation.
Experiments on urban datasets demonstrate that GS4Buildings improves
reconstruction completeness by 20.5% and geometric accuracy by 32.8%. These
results highlight the potential of semantic building model integration to
advance GS-based reconstruction toward real-world urban applications such as
smart cities and digital twins. Our project is available:

Conclusion: 该方法在质量和效率上均达到领先水平，为跨传感器泛化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning methods for pansharpening have advanced rapidly, yet models
pretrained on data from a specific sensor often generalize poorly to data from
other sensors. Existing methods to tackle such cross-sensor degradation include
retraining model or zero-shot methods, but they are highly time-consuming or
even need extra training data. To address these challenges, our method first
performs modular decomposition on deep learning-based pansharpening models,
revealing a general yet critical interface where high-dimensional fused
features begin mapping to the channel space of the final image. % may need
revisement A Feature Tailor is then integrated at this interface to address
cross-sensor degradation at the feature level, and is trained efficiently with
physics-aware unsupervised losses. Moreover, our method operates in a
patch-wise manner, training on partial patches and performing parallel
inference on all patches to boost efficiency. Our method offers two key
advantages: (1) $\textit{Improved Generalization Ability}$: it significantly
enhance performance in cross-sensor cases. (2) $\textit{Low Generalization
Cost}$: it achieves sub-second training and inference, requiring only partial
test inputs and no external data, whereas prior methods often take minutes or
even hours. Experiments on the real-world data from multiple datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art quality and efficiency in
tackling cross-sensor degradation. For example, training and inference of
$512\times512\times8$ image within $\textit{0.2 seconds}$ and
$4000\times4000\times8$ image within $\textit{3 seconds}$ at the fastest
setting on a commonly used RTX 3090 GPU, which is over 100 times faster than
zero-shot methods.

Result: DIP-GS在稀疏视图重建任务中取得了竞争性的SOTA结果。

Conclusion: DIP-GS通过结合DIP先验，显著提升了3DGS在稀疏视图场景下的性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a leading 3D scene reconstruction method,
obtaining high-quality reconstruction with real-time rendering runtime
performance. The main idea behind 3DGS is to represent the scene as a
collection of 3D gaussians, while learning their parameters to fit the given
views of the scene. While achieving superior performance in the presence of
many views, 3DGS struggles with sparse view reconstruction, where the input
views are sparse and do not fully cover the scene and have low overlaps. In
this paper, we propose DIP-GS, a Deep Image Prior (DIP) 3DGS representation. By
using the DIP prior, which utilizes internal structure and patterns, with
coarse-to-fine manner, DIP-based 3DGS can operate in scenarios where vanilla
3DGS fails, such as sparse view recovery. Note that our approach does not use
any pre-trained models such as generative models and depth estimation, but
rather relies only on the input frames. Among such methods, DIP-GS obtains
state-of-the-art (SOTA) competitive results on various sparse-view
reconstruction tasks, demonstrating its capabilities.

Result: 实验表明，LET-US在长事件流的描述准确性和语义理解上优于现有MLLMs。

Conclusion: LET-US为长事件流与文本的跨模态理解设立了新标准，相关资源将公开。

Abstract: Event cameras output event streams as sparse, asynchronous data with
microsecond-level temporal resolution, enabling visual perception with low
latency and a high dynamic range. While existing Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant success in understanding and analyzing
RGB video content, they either fail to interpret event streams effectively or
remain constrained to very short sequences. In this paper, we introduce LET-US,
a framework for long event-stream--text comprehension that employs an adaptive
compression mechanism to reduce the volume of input events while preserving
critical visual details. LET-US thus establishes a new frontier in cross-modal
inferential understanding over extended event sequences. To bridge the
substantial modality gap between event streams and textual representations, we
adopt a two-stage optimization paradigm that progressively equips our model
with the capacity to interpret event-based scenes. To handle the voluminous
temporal information inherent in long event streams, we leverage text-guided
cross-modal queries for feature reduction, augmented by hierarchical clustering
and similarity computation to distill the most representative event features.
Moreover, we curate and construct a large-scale event-text aligned dataset to
train our model, achieving tighter alignment of event features within the LLM
embedding space. We also develop a comprehensive benchmark covering a diverse
set of tasks -- reasoning, captioning, classification, temporal localization
and moment retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate that LET-US outperforms
prior state-of-the-art MLLMs in both descriptive accuracy and semantic
comprehension on long-duration event streams. All datasets, codes, and models
will be publicly available.

Conclusion: ForensicsSAM有效提升对抗鲁棒性，并在伪造检测与定位任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a popular strategy for
adapting large vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model
(SAM) and LLaVA, to downstream tasks like image forgery detection and
localization (IFDL). However, existing PEFT-based approaches overlook their
vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we show that highly
transferable adversarial images can be crafted solely via the upstream model,
without accessing the downstream model or training data, significantly
degrading the IFDL performance. To address this, we propose ForensicsSAM, a
unified IFDL framework with built-in adversarial robustness. Our design is
guided by three key ideas: (1) To compensate for the lack of forgery-relevant
knowledge in the frozen image encoder, we inject forgery experts into each
transformer block to enhance its ability to capture forgery artifacts. These
forgery experts are always activated and shared across any input images. (2) To
detect adversarial images, we design an light-weight adversary detector that
learns to capture structured, task-specific artifact in RGB domain, enabling
reliable discrimination across various attack methods. (3) To resist
adversarial attacks, we inject adversary experts into the global attention
layers and MLP modules to progressively correct feature shifts induced by
adversarial noise. These adversary experts are adaptively activated by the
adversary detector, thereby avoiding unnecessary interference with clean
images. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
ForensicsSAM achieves superior resistance to various adversarial attack
methods, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance in image-level
forgery detection and pixel-level forgery localization. The resource is

TL;DR: CharacterShot是一个可控且一致的4D角色动画框架，通过单张参考图像和2D姿态序列生成动态3D角色动画。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为设计师提供一种简单方法，从单张图像和2D姿态序列生成高质量的4D角色动画。

Method: 结合2D动画模型、双注意力模块、相机先验和多视角视频优化，实现4D高斯溅射优化。

Result: 在CharacterBench基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CharacterShot为4D角色动画提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose \textbf{CharacterShot}, a controllable and
consistent 4D character animation framework that enables any individual
designer to create dynamic 3D characters (i.e., 4D character animation) from a
single reference character image and a 2D pose sequence. We begin by
pretraining a powerful 2D character animation model based on a cutting-edge
DiT-based image-to-video model, which allows for any 2D pose sequnce as
controllable signal. We then lift the animation model from 2D to 3D through
introducing dual-attention module together with camera prior to generate
multi-view videos with spatial-temporal and spatial-view consistency. Finally,
we employ a novel neighbor-constrained 4D gaussian splatting optimization on
these multi-view videos, resulting in continuous and stable 4D character
representations. Moreover, to improve character-centric performance, we
construct a large-scale dataset Character4D, containing 13,115 unique
characters with diverse appearances and motions, rendered from multiple
viewpoints. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark,
CharacterBench, demonstrate that our approach outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods. Code, models, and datasets will be publicly available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像编辑工具和生成式AI的普及，数字媒体的真实性受到威胁，需要更高效的伪造检测方法。

Method: 结合SD3的Rectified Flow机制和LoRA技术，注入噪声放大伪造痕迹，并利用SAM的语义上下文增强定位精度。

Result: CLUE在泛化性能和鲁棒性上显著优于现有方法，并能抵抗常见后处理攻击和社交网络干扰。

Conclusion: CLUE为伪造图像定位提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: The increasing accessibility of image editing tools and generative AI has led
to a proliferation of visually convincing forgeries, compromising the
authenticity of digital media. In this paper, in addition to leveraging
distortions from conventional forgeries, we repurpose the mechanism of a
state-of-the-art (SOTA) text-to-image synthesis model by exploiting its
internal generative process, turning it into a high-fidelity forgery
localization tool. To this end, we propose CLUE (Capture Latent Uncovered
Evidence), a framework that employs Low- Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to
parameter-efficiently reconfigure Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) as a forensic
feature extractor. Our approach begins with the strategic use of SD3's
Rectified Flow (RF) mechanism to inject noise at varying intensities into the
latent representation, thereby steering the LoRAtuned denoising process to
amplify subtle statistical inconsistencies indicative of a forgery. To
complement the latent analysis with high-level semantic context and precise
spatial details, our method incorporates contextual features from the image
encoder of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), which is parameter-efficiently
adapted to better trace the boundaries of forged regions. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate CLUE's SOTA generalization performance, significantly outperforming
prior methods. Furthermore, CLUE shows superior robustness against common
post-processing attacks and Online Social Networks (OSNs). Code is publicly
available at https://github.com/SZAISEC/CLUE.

TL;DR: 论文分析了视觉语言模型中的性别偏见来源，提出了两种去偏方法（CDA和DAUDoS），并通过实验验证了其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在训练数据中继承了性别偏见，需要明确偏见来源并有效减少偏见。

Method: 采用反事实数据增强（CDA）和基于刻板印象程度的新方法（DAUDoS）进行去偏。

Result: CDA减少性别差距6%，DAUDoS减少3%且仅需三分之一数据；两种方法均提升性别识别准确率3%。

Conclusion: 视觉编码器（CLIP）和文本编码器（PaliGemma2）的偏见来源不同，未来可针对性优化。

Abstract: Vision Language Models achieve impressive multi-modal performance but often
inherit gender biases from their training data. This bias might be coming from
both the vision and text modalities. In this work, we dissect the contributions
of vision and text backbones to these biases by applying targeted debiasing
using Counterfactual Data Augmentation and Task Vector methods. Inspired by
data-efficient approaches in hate-speech classification, we introduce a novel
metric, Degree of Stereotypicality and a corresponding debiasing method, Data
Augmentation Using Degree of Stereotypicality - DAUDoS, to reduce bias with
minimal computational cost. We curate a gender annotated dataset and evaluate
all methods on VisoGender benchmark to quantify improvements and identify
dominant source of bias. Our results show that CDA reduces the gender gap by 6%
and DAUDoS by 3% but using only one-third of the data. Both methods also
improve the model's ability to correctly identify gender in images by 3%, with
DAUDoS achieving this improvement using only almost one-third of training data.
From our experiment's, we observed that CLIP's vision encoder is more biased
whereas PaliGemma2's text encoder is more biased. By identifying whether bias
stems more from vision or text encoders, our work enables more targeted and
effective bias mitigation strategies in future multi-modal systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种两阶段框架，利用模型的学习偏置来解决完全无监督图像异常检测（FUIAD）中训练数据可能包含未标记异常的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法假设训练数据无异常，但现实数据可能被污染，导致模型将异常误认为正常，影响检测性能。

Method: 框架分为两阶段：第一阶段利用学习偏置（统计优势和特征空间差异）筛选纯净数据集；第二阶段在纯净数据集上训练最终检测器。

Result: 在Real-IAD基准测试中表现出优异的异常检测和定位性能，且对噪声具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架具有模型无关性，适用于现实场景中不完美的训练数据。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of fully unsupervised image anomaly
detection (FUIAD), where training data may contain unlabeled anomalies.
Conventional methods assume anomaly-free training data, but real-world
contamination leads models to absorb anomalies as normal, degrading detection
performance. To mitigate this, we propose a two-stage framework that
systematically exploits inherent learning bias in models. The learning bias
stems from: (1) the statistical dominance of normal samples, driving models to
prioritize learning stable normal patterns over sparse anomalies, and (2)
feature-space divergence, where normal data exhibit high intra-class
consistency while anomalies display high diversity, leading to unstable model
responses. Leveraging the learning bias, stage 1 partitions the training set
into subsets, trains sub-models, and aggregates cross-model anomaly scores to
filter a purified dataset. Stage 2 trains the final detector on this dataset.
Experiments on the Real-IAD benchmark demonstrate superior anomaly detection
and localization performance under different noise conditions. Ablation studies
further validate the framework's contamination resilience, emphasizing the
critical role of learning bias exploitation. The model-agnostic design ensures
compatibility with diverse unsupervised backbones, offering a practical
solution for real-world scenarios with imperfect training data. Code is

YOLOv8-n and YOLOv5-s using Stratified K-fold techniques where we use 5 folds
on combined HCW data, and found that the YOLOv5-s achieved higher of 95.06%
accuracy but fell short few milliseconds in inference speed with YOLOv8-n
model. The EfficientNet-B0 showed promising results of 93.22% accuracy but took
the highest inference time. A repetitive ANOVA was performed to see statistical

TL;DR: AURA是一个新的音频-视觉基准测试，旨在评估跨模态推理能力，避免单模态捷径，并引入AuraScore评估推理保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试仅关注最终答案准确性，忽略了推理过程，难以区分真实理解与错误推理得出的正确答案。

Method: AURA包含六个认知领域的问题，设计为无法通过单一模态回答，并提出了AuraScore评估推理一致性。

Result: SOTA模型在AURA上显示出高准确率但低推理保真度，表明模型常通过错误逻辑得出正确答案。

Conclusion: AURA和AuraScore揭示了模型推理缺陷，为更稳健的多模态评估铺平了道路。

Abstract: Current audio-visual (AV) benchmarks focus on final answer accuracy,
overlooking the underlying reasoning process. This makes it difficult to
distinguish genuine comprehension from correct answers derived through flawed
reasoning or hallucinations. To address this, we introduce AURA (Audio-visual
Understanding and Reasoning Assessment), a benchmark for evaluating the
cross-modal reasoning capabilities of Audio-Visual Large Language Models
(AV-LLMs) and Omni-modal Language Models (OLMs). AURA includes questions across
six challenging cognitive domains, such as causality, timbre and pitch, tempo
and AV synchronization, unanswerability, implicit distractions, and skill
profiling, explicitly designed to be unanswerable from a single modality. This
forces models to construct a valid logical path grounded in both audio and
video, setting AURA apart from AV datasets that allow uni-modal shortcuts. To
assess reasoning traces, we propose a novel metric, AuraScore, which addresses
the lack of robust tools for evaluating reasoning fidelity. It decomposes
reasoning into two aspects: (i) Factual Consistency - whether reasoning is
grounded in perceptual evidence, and (ii) Core Inference - the logical validity
of each reasoning step. Evaluations of SOTA models on AURA reveal a critical
reasoning gap: although models achieve high accuracy (up to 92% on some tasks),
their Factual Consistency and Core Inference scores fall below 45%. This
discrepancy highlights that models often arrive at correct answers through
flawed logic, underscoring the need for our benchmark and paving the way for
more robust multimodal evaluation.

Conclusion: 高斯泼溅在3D重建和视图合成中具有潜力，为扩展现实（XR）、摄影测量和自动驾驶模拟提供了有价值的信息。

Abstract: In this paper, I present a comprehensive study comparing Photogrammetry and
Gaussian Splatting techniques for 3D model reconstruction and view synthesis. I
created a dataset of images from a real-world scene and constructed 3D models
using both methods. To evaluate the performance, I compared the models using
structural similarity index (SSIM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), learned
perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), and lp/mm resolution based on the
USAF resolution chart. A significant contribution of this work is the
development of a modified Gaussian Splatting repository, which I forked and
enhanced to enable rendering images from novel camera poses generated in the
Blender environment. This innovation allows for the synthesis of high-quality
novel views, showcasing the flexibility and potential of Gaussian Splatting. My
investigation extends to an augmented dataset that includes both original
ground images and novel views synthesized via Gaussian Splatting. This
augmented dataset was employed to generate a new photogrammetry model, which
was then compared against the original photogrammetry model created using only
the original images. The results demonstrate the efficacy of using Gaussian
Splatting to generate novel high-quality views and its potential to improve
photogrammetry-based 3D reconstructions. The comparative analysis highlights
the strengths and limitations of both approaches, providing valuable
information for applications in extended reality (XR), photogrammetry, and
autonomous vehicle simulations. Code is available at

Conclusion: VisR-Bench为多语言视觉检索提供了新基准，揭示了当前模型的局限性，尤其是对复杂结构和低资源语言的处理。

Abstract: Most organizational data in this world are stored as documents, and visual
retrieval plays a crucial role in unlocking the collective intelligence from
all these documents. However, existing benchmarks focus on English-only
document retrieval or only consider multilingual question-answering on a
single-page image. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisR-Bench, a multilingual
benchmark designed for question-driven multimodal retrieval in long documents.
Our benchmark comprises over 35K high-quality QA pairs across 1.2K documents,
enabling fine-grained evaluation of multimodal retrieval. VisR-Bench spans
sixteen languages with three question types (figures, text, and tables),
offering diverse linguistic and question coverage. Unlike prior datasets, we
include queries without explicit answers, preventing models from relying on
superficial keyword matching. We evaluate various retrieval models, including
text-based methods, multimodal encoders, and MLLMs, providing insights into
their strengths and limitations. Our results show that while MLLMs
significantly outperform text-based and multimodal encoder models, they still
struggle with structured tables and low-resource languages, highlighting key
challenges in multilingual visual retrieval.

Conclusion: 模型具有鲁棒性和实际应用价值，已部署于大规模自动化作物和杂草监测中。

Abstract: Field trials are vital in herbicide research and development to assess
effects on crops and weeds under varied conditions. Traditionally, evaluations
rely on manual visual assessments, which are time-consuming, labor-intensive,
and subjective. Automating species and damage identification is challenging due
to subtle visual differences, but it can greatly enhance efficiency and
consistency.
  We present an improved segmentation model combining a general-purpose
self-supervised visual model with hierarchical inference based on botanical
taxonomy. Trained on a multi-year dataset (2018-2020) from Germany and Spain
using digital and mobile cameras, the model was tested on digital camera data
(year 2023) and drone imagery from the United States, Germany, and Spain (year
2024) to evaluate robustness under domain shift. This cross-device evaluation
marks a key step in assessing generalization across platforms of the model.
  Our model significantly improved species identification (F1-score: 0.52 to
0.85, R-squared: 0.75 to 0.98) and damage classification (F1-score: 0.28 to
0.44, R-squared: 0.71 to 0.87) over prior methods. Under domain shift (drone
images), it maintained strong performance with moderate degradation (species:
F1-score 0.60, R-squared 0.80; damage: F1-score 0.41, R-squared 0.62), where
earlier models failed.
  These results confirm the model's robustness and real-world applicability. It
is now deployed in BASF's phenotyping pipeline, enabling large-scale, automated
crop and weed monitoring across diverse geographies.

Result: 方法支持从全局到局部的编辑，适用于包括少步模型在内的多种MM-DiT变体。

Conclusion: 研究填补了U-Net方法与新兴架构之间的差距，提供了对MM-DiT行为模式的深入理解。

Abstract: Transformer-based diffusion models have recently superseded traditional U-Net
architectures, with multimodal diffusion transformers (MM-DiT) emerging as the
dominant approach in state-of-the-art models like Stable Diffusion 3 and
Flux.1. Previous approaches have relied on unidirectional cross-attention
mechanisms, with information flowing from text embeddings to image latents. In
contrast, MMDiT introduces a unified attention mechanism that concatenates
input projections from both modalities and performs a single full attention
operation, allowing bidirectional information flow between text and image
branches. This architectural shift presents significant challenges for existing
editing techniques. In this paper, we systematically analyze MM-DiT's attention
mechanism by decomposing attention matrices into four distinct blocks,
revealing their inherent characteristics. Through these analyses, we propose a
robust, prompt-based image editing method for MM-DiT that supports global to
local edits across various MM-DiT variants, including few-step models. We
believe our findings bridge the gap between existing U-Net-based methods and
emerging architectures, offering deeper insights into MMDiT's behavioral
patterns.

Abstract: Fine-grained multimodal capability in Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) has emerged as a critical research direction, particularly for tackling
the visual grounding (VG) problem. Despite the strong performance achieved by
existing approaches, they often employ disparate design choices when
fine-tuning MLLMs for VG, lacking systematic verification to support these
designs. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive study of
various design choices that impact the VG performance of MLLMs. We conduct our
analysis using LLaVA-1.5, which has been widely adopted in prior empirical
studies of MLLMs. While more recent models exist, we follow this convention to
ensure our findings remain broadly applicable and extendable to other
architectures. We cover two key aspects: (1) exploring different visual
grounding paradigms in MLLMs, identifying the most effective design, and
providing our insights; and (2) conducting ablation studies on the design of
grounding data to optimize MLLMs' fine-tuning for the VG task. Finally, our
findings contribute to a stronger MLLM for VG, achieving improvements of +5.6%
/ +6.9% / +7.0% on RefCOCO/+/g over the LLaVA-1.5.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了医学图像诊断的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: In medical image processing, accurate diagnosis is of paramount importance.
Leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly top-rank learning, shows
significant promise by focusing on the most crucial instances. However,
challenges arise from noisy labels and class-ambiguous instances, which can
severely hinder the top-rank objective, as they may be erroneously placed among
the top-ranked instances. To address these, we propose a novel approach that
enhances toprank learning by integrating a rejection module. Cooptimized with
the top-rank loss, this module identifies and mitigates the impact of outliers
that hinder training effectiveness. The rejection module functions as an
additional branch, assessing instances based on a rejection function that
measures their deviation from the norm. Through experimental validation on a
medical dataset, our methodology demonstrates its efficacy in detecting and
mitigating outliers, improving the reliability and accuracy of medical image
diagnoses.

Conclusion: 结构先验为中文文本SR提供了有效的字符级指导，显著提升了视觉质量和结构准确性。

Abstract: Faithful text image super-resolution (SR) is challenging because each
character has a unique structure and usually exhibits diverse font styles and
layouts. While existing methods primarily focus on English text, less attention
has been paid to more complex scripts like Chinese. In this paper, we introduce
a high-quality text image SR framework designed to restore the precise strokes
of low-resolution (LR) Chinese characters. Unlike methods that rely on
character recognition priors to regularize the SR task, we propose a novel
structure prior that offers structure-level guidance to enhance visual quality.
Our framework incorporates this structure prior within a StyleGAN model,
leveraging its generative capabilities for restoration. To maintain the
integrity of character structures while accommodating various font styles and
layouts, we implement a codebook-based mechanism that restricts the generative
space of StyleGAN. Each code in the codebook represents the structure of a
specific character, while the vector $w$ in StyleGAN controls the character's
style, including typeface, orientation, and location. Through the collaborative
interaction between the codebook and style, we generate a high-resolution
structure prior that aligns with LR characters both spatially and structurally.
Experiments demonstrate that this structure prior provides robust,
character-specific guidance, enabling the accurate restoration of clear strokes
in degraded characters, even for real-world LR Chinese text with irregular
layouts. Our code and pre-trained models will be available at

*Hongzhu Jiang,Sihan Xie,Zhiyu Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了医学图像去标识化的重要性，介绍了MIDI-B挑战赛及其结果，并分析了当前方法的局限性和未来改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像共享需遵守隐私法规（如HIPAA、DICOM PS3.15），去标识化是保护患者隐私的关键。

Method: 采用像素掩码、日期偏移、哈希、文本识别与替换等方法处理DICOM图像。

Result: 算法在MIDI-B挑战赛中正确执行99.92%的任务，排名第二。

Conclusion: 当前方法有效但仍有限制，未来需进一步优化。

Abstract: Image de-identification is essential for the public sharing of medical
images, particularly in the widely used Digital Imaging and Communications in
Medicine (DICOM) format as required by various regulations and standards,
including Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy
rules, the DICOM PS3.15 standard, and best practices recommended by the Cancer
Imaging Archive (TCIA). The Medical Image De-Identification Benchmark (MIDI-B)
Challenge at the 27th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and
Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2024) was organized to evaluate
rule-based DICOM image de-identification algorithms with a large dataset of
clinical DICOM images. In this report, we explore the critical challenges of
de-identifying DICOM images, emphasize the importance of removing personally
identifiable information (PII) to protect patient privacy while ensuring the
continued utility of medical data for research, diagnostics, and treatment, and
provide a comprehensive overview of the standards and regulations that govern
this process. Additionally, we detail the de-identification methods we applied
- such as pixel masking, date shifting, date hashing, text recognition, text
replacement, and text removal - to process datasets during the test phase in
strict compliance with these standards. According to the final leaderboard of
the MIDI-B challenge, the latest version of our solution algorithm correctly
executed 99.92% of the required actions and ranked 2nd out of 10 teams that
completed the challenge (from a total of 22 registered teams). Finally, we
conducted a thorough analysis of the resulting statistics and discussed the
limitations of current approaches and potential avenues for future improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖多医院数据，但数据收集困难，因此提出利用医院内域偏移的方法。

Method: 通过聚类WSI特征并应用两阶段对比学习（WSI级和patch级）来减少域偏移。

Result: 有效减少了病理图像中的域偏移问题。

Conclusion: 该方法为病理图像域泛化提供了一种实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we address domain shifts in pathological images by focusing on
shifts within whole slide images~(WSIs), such as patient characteristics and
tissue thickness, rather than shifts between hospitals. Traditional approaches
rely on multi-hospital data, but data collection challenges often make this
impractical. Therefore, the proposed domain generalization method captures and
leverages intra-hospital domain shifts by clustering WSI-level features from
non-tumor regions and treating these clusters as domains. To mitigate domain
shift, we apply contrastive learning to reduce feature gaps between WSI pairs
from different clusters. The proposed method introduces a two-stage contrastive
learning approach WSI-level and patch-level contrastive learning to minimize
these gaps effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到姿态生成模型依赖低层次详细提示，而人类倾向于使用高层次抽象语言描述动作，导致实际应用中的不匹配。

Method: 提出结合CoT推理的框架，将抽象提示转化为准确3D姿态，并设计数据合成流程生成训练所需的三元组（抽象提示、详细提示、对应姿态）。

Result: 实验表明，CoT-Pose能从抽象文本输入生成语义对齐的合理姿态。

Conclusion: 研究强调了高层次理解在姿态生成中的重要性，为推理增强方法开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have led to significant progress in image and
text generation tasks. However, the field of 3D human pose generation still
faces critical limitations. Most existing text-to-pose models rely heavily on
detailed (low-level) prompts that explicitly describe joint configurations. In
contrast, humans tend to communicate actions and intentions using abstract
(high-level) language. This mismatch results in a practical challenge for
deploying pose generation systems in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap,
we introduce a novel framework that incorporates CoT reasoning into the pose
generation process, enabling the interpretation of abstract prompts into
accurate 3D human poses. We further propose a data synthesis pipeline that
automatically generates triplets of abstract prompts, detailed prompts, and
corresponding 3D poses for training process. Experimental results demonstrate
that our reasoning-enhanced model, CoT-Pose, can effectively generate plausible
and semantically aligned poses from abstract textual inputs. This work
highlights the importance of high-level understanding in pose generation and
opens new directions for reasoning-enhanced approach for human pose generation.

Result: MatchVoice展现了良好的泛化能力，但仍需整合更广泛的视频-语言技术以进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调了进一步整合多领域技术的重要性，为足球评论生成提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Automated soccer commentary generation has evolved from template-based
systems to advanced neural architectures, aiming to produce real-time
descriptions of sports events. While frameworks like SoccerNet-Caption laid
foundational work, their inability to achieve fine-grained alignment between
video content and commentary remains a significant challenge. Recent efforts
such as MatchTime, with its MatchVoice model, address this issue through coarse
and fine-grained alignment techniques, achieving improved temporal
synchronization. In this paper, we extend MatchVoice to commentary generation
for soccer highlights using the GOAL dataset, which emphasizes short clips over
entire games. We conduct extensive experiments to reproduce the original
MatchTime results and evaluate our setup, highlighting the impact of different
training configurations and hardware limitations. Furthermore, we explore the
effect of varying window sizes on zero-shot performance. While MatchVoice
exhibits promising generalization capabilities, our findings suggest the need
for integrating techniques from broader video-language domains to further
enhance performance. Our code is available at

effective pseudo-labels. We introduce Positive and Unlabeled Learning (PU
learning), which uses only positive and unlabeled data for binary

foreground and background regions on each unlabeled image. Our PU learning
makes us easy to select pseudo-labels for various background regions. The

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于特征图收敛分数（FMCS）的独立评估方法，用于提升自动驾驶感知和规划中端到端模型的透明度和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端模型在自动驾驶中成为主流，但缺乏对中间功能模块的显式监督信号，导致机制不透明且可解释性有限。

Method: 构建了双粒度动态加权评分系统（DG-DWSS），并提出基于CLIP的特征图质量评估网络（CLIP-FMQE-Net），实时分析特征图质量。

Result: 在NuScenes数据集上，该方法提升了3D目标检测性能，NDS提高了3.89%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了特征表示质量和整体模型性能。

Abstract: End-to-end models are emerging as the mainstream in autonomous driving
perception and planning. However, the lack of explicit supervision signals for
intermediate functional modules leads to opaque operational mechanisms and
limited interpretability, making it challenging for traditional methods to
independently evaluate and train these modules. Pioneering in the issue, this
study builds upon the feature map-truth representation similarity-based
evaluation framework and proposes an independent evaluation method based on
Feature Map Convergence Score (FMCS). A Dual-Granularity Dynamic Weighted
Scoring System (DG-DWSS) is constructed, formulating a unified quantitative
metric - Feature Map Quality Score - to enable comprehensive evaluation of the
quality of feature maps generated by functional modules. A CLIP-based Feature
Map Quality Evaluation Network (CLIP-FMQE-Net) is further developed, combining
feature-truth encoders and quality score prediction heads to enable real-time
quality analysis of feature maps generated by functional modules. Experimental
results on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate that integrating our evaluation
module into the training improves 3D object detection performance, achieving a
3.89 percent gain in NDS. These results verify the effectiveness of our method
in enhancing feature representation quality and overall model performance.

Abstract: Generating high-quality 4D content from monocular videos for applications
such as digital humans and AR/VR poses challenges in ensuring temporal and
spatial consistency, preserving intricate details, and incorporating user
guidance effectively. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Splat4D, a
novel framework enabling high-fidelity 4D content generation from a monocular
video. Splat4D achieves superior performance while maintaining faithful
spatial-temporal coherence by leveraging multi-view rendering, inconsistency
identification, a video diffusion model, and an asymmetric U-Net for
refinement. Through extensive evaluations on public benchmarks, Splat4D
consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across various metrics,
underscoring the efficacy of our approach. Additionally, the versatility of
Splat4D is validated in various applications such as text/image conditioned 4D

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ACE的框架，通过动态缓存高置信度或低熵图像嵌入，解决了现有基于缓存的TTA方法在分布偏移下的不可靠性和决策边界僵化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）在零样本泛化方面表现优异，但在下游任务中面临分布偏移导致的性能下降问题，尤其是在缺乏标注数据时。现有的基于缓存的TTA方法存在置信度不可靠和决策边界僵化的局限性。

Method: ACE框架通过动态、类别特定的阈值选择性地存储高置信度或低熵图像嵌入，并使用指数移动平均和探索增强更新迭代优化这些阈值，从而构建鲁棒的缓存。

Result: 在15个多样化基准数据集上的实验表明，ACE在具有挑战性的分布偏移场景中实现了最先进的性能，表现出卓越的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ACE通过自适应类别决策边界和动态缓存优化，显著提升了TTA方法在分布偏移下的性能，为视觉语言模型的在线优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot generalization but
suffer performance degradation under distribution shifts in downstream tasks,
particularly in the absence of labeled data. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)
addresses this challenge by enabling online optimization of VLMs during
inference, eliminating the need for annotated data. Cache-based TTA methods
exploit historical knowledge by maintaining a dynamic memory cache of
low-entropy or high-confidence samples, promoting efficient adaptation to
out-of-distribution data. Nevertheless, these methods face two critical
challenges: (1) unreliable confidence metrics under significant distribution
shifts, resulting in error accumulation within the cache and degraded
adaptation performance; and (2) rigid decision boundaries that fail to
accommodate substantial distributional variations, leading to suboptimal
predictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Adaptive Cache
Enhancement (ACE) framework, which constructs a robust cache by selectively
storing high-confidence or low-entropy image embeddings per class, guided by
dynamic, class-specific thresholds initialized from zero-shot statistics and
iteratively refined using an exponential moving average and
exploration-augmented updates. This approach enables adaptive, class-wise
decision boundaries, ensuring robust and accurate predictions across diverse
visual distributions. Extensive experiments on 15 diverse benchmark datasets
demonstrate that ACE achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior
robustness and generalization compared to existing TTA methods in challenging
out-of-distribution scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了LayerNorm在Vision Transformers（ViTs）中的微调动态，特别是在数据稀缺和领域转移的情况下。通过提出的Fine-tuning Shift Ratio（FSR）和标量λ，提出了一种有效的重新缩放机制，并结合循环框架优化LayerNorm微调。实验验证了该框架在多种场景下的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LayerNorm在ViTs中至关重要，但其在数据稀缺和领域转移下的微调动态尚未充分研究。本文旨在探索LayerNorm参数的变化如何反映源域和目标域之间的过渡，并提出优化方法。

Method: 提出了Fine-tuning Shift Ratio（FSR）量化目标训练样本的代表性，并设计了一个标量λ（与FSR负相关）来调整LayerNorm参数。此外，引入循环框架进一步优化微调过程。

Result: 实验表明，OOD任务通常具有较低的FSR和较高的λ，尤其是在数据稀缺时，表明目标训练样本代表性不足。病理数据微调更倾向于保守的LayerNorm更新。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了LayerNorm在迁移学习中的动态特性，并提供了实用的微调策略，为ViTs在数据稀缺和领域转移下的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: LayerNorm is pivotal in Vision Transformers (ViTs), yet its fine-tuning
dynamics under data scarcity and domain shifts remain underexplored. This paper
shows that shifts in LayerNorm parameters after fine-tuning (LayerNorm shifts)
are indicative of the transitions between source and target domains; its
efficacy is contingent upon the degree to which the target training samples
accurately represent the target domain, as quantified by our proposed
Fine-tuning Shift Ratio ($FSR$). Building on this, we propose a simple yet
effective rescaling mechanism using a scalar $\lambda$ that is negatively
correlated to $FSR$ to align learned LayerNorm shifts with those ideal shifts
achieved under fully representative data, combined with a cyclic framework that
further enhances the LayerNorm fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across
natural and pathological images, in both in-distribution (ID) and
out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, and various target training sample regimes
validate our framework. Notably, OOD tasks tend to yield lower $FSR$ and higher
$\lambda$ in comparison to ID cases, especially with scarce data, indicating
under-represented target training samples. Moreover, ViTFs fine-tuned on
pathological data behave more like ID settings, favoring conservative LayerNorm
updates. Our findings illuminate the underexplored dynamics of LayerNorm in
transfer learning and provide practical strategies for LayerNorm fine-tuning.

Conclusion: GAPNet通过高效的特征融合和适当的监督机制，显著提升了轻量级SOD模型的性能。

Abstract: Recent salient object detection (SOD) models predominantly rely on
heavyweight backbones, incurring substantial computational cost and hindering
their practical application in various real-world settings, particularly on
edge devices. This paper presents GAPNet, a lightweight network built on the
granularity-aware paradigm for both image and video SOD. We assign saliency
maps of different granularities to supervise the multi-scale decoder
side-outputs: coarse object locations for high-level outputs and fine-grained
object boundaries for low-level outputs. Specifically, our decoder is built
with granularity-aware connections which fuse high-level features of low
granularity and low-level features of high granularity, respectively. To
support these connections, we design granular pyramid convolution (GPC) and
cross-scale attention (CSA) modules for efficient fusion of low-scale and
high-scale features, respectively. On top of the encoder, a self-attention
module is built to learn global information, enabling accurate object
localization with negligible computational cost. Unlike traditional U-Net-based
approaches, our proposed method optimizes feature utilization and semantic
interpretation while applying appropriate supervision at each processing stage.
Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves a new
state-of-the-art performance among lightweight image and video SOD models. Code

Abstract: Voice disorders significantly affect communication and quality of life,
requiring an early and accurate diagnosis. Traditional methods like
laryngoscopy are invasive, subjective, and often inaccessible. This research
proposes a noninvasive, machine learning-based framework for detecting voice
pathologies using phonation data.
  Phonation data from the Saarbr\"ucken Voice Database are analyzed using
acoustic features such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), chroma
features, and Mel spectrograms. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), including
LSTM and attention mechanisms, classify samples into normal and pathological
categories. Data augmentation techniques, including pitch shifting and Gaussian
noise addition, enhance model generalizability, while preprocessing ensures
signal quality. Scale-based features, such as H\"older and Hurst exponents,
further capture signal irregularities and long-term dependencies.
  The proposed framework offers a noninvasive, automated diagnostic tool for
early detection of voice pathologies, supporting AI-driven healthcare, and
improving patient outcomes.

Conclusion: 该框架为可解释的深度伪造检测提供了可扩展的解决方案，推动了可信赖和透明AI系统的发展。

Abstract: The proliferation of deepfake technologies poses urgent challenges and
serious risks to digital integrity, particularly within critical sectors such
as forensics, journalism, and the legal system. While existing detection
systems have made significant progress in classification accuracy, they
typically function as black-box models, offering limited transparency and
minimal support for human reasoning. This lack of interpretability hinders
their usability in real-world decision-making contexts, especially for
non-expert users. In this paper, we present DF-P2E (Deepfake: Prediction to
Explanation), a novel multimodal framework that integrates visual, semantic,
and narrative layers of explanation to make deepfake detection interpretable
and accessible. The framework consists of three modular components: (1) a
deepfake classifier with Grad-CAM-based saliency visualisation, (2) a visual
captioning module that generates natural language summaries of manipulated
regions, and (3) a narrative refinement module that uses a fine-tuned Large
Language Model (LLM) to produce context-aware, user-sensitive explanations. We
instantiate and evaluate the framework on the DF40 benchmark, the most diverse
deepfake dataset to date. Experiments demonstrate that our system achieves
competitive detection performance while providing high-quality explanations
aligned with Grad-CAM activations. By unifying prediction and explanation in a
coherent, human-aligned pipeline, this work offers a scalable approach to
interpretable deepfake detection, advancing the broader vision of trustworthy
and transparent AI systems in adversarial media environments.

Abstract: Over-the-shoulder dialogue videos are essential in films, short dramas, and
advertisements, providing visual variety and enhancing viewers' emotional
connection. Despite their importance, such dialogue scenes remain largely
underexplored in video generation research. The main challenges include
maintaining character consistency across different shots, creating a sense of
spatial continuity, and generating long, multi-turn dialogues within limited
computational budgets. Here, we present ShoulderShot, a framework that combines
dual-shot generation with looping video, enabling extended dialogues while
preserving character consistency. Our results demonstrate capabilities that
surpass existing methods in terms of shot-reverse-shot layout, spatial
continuity, and flexibility in dialogue length, thereby opening up new
possibilities for practical dialogue video generation. Videos and comparisons

Conclusion: LaVieID通过空间和时间优化，显著提升了身份保持视频生成的效果。

Abstract: In this paper, we present LaVieID, a novel \underline{l}ocal
\underline{a}utoregressive \underline{vi}d\underline{e}o diffusion framework
designed to tackle the challenging \underline{id}entity-preserving
text-to-video task. The key idea of LaVieID is to mitigate the loss of identity
information inherent in the stochastic global generation process of diffusion
transformers (DiTs) from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Specifically,
unlike the global and unstructured modeling of facial latent states in existing
DiTs, LaVieID introduces a local router to explicitly represent latent states
by weighted combinations of fine-grained local facial structures. This
alleviates undesirable feature interference and encourages DiTs to capture
distinctive facial characteristics. Furthermore, a temporal autoregressive
module is integrated into LaVieID to refine denoised latent tokens before video
decoding. This module divides latent tokens temporally into chunks, exploiting
their long-range temporal dependencies to predict biases for rectifying tokens,
thereby significantly enhancing inter-frame identity consistency. Consequently,
LaVieID can generate high-fidelity personalized videos and achieve
state-of-the-art performance. Our code and models are available at

industry-leading unified image generation models and expert models to construct
the data. Meanwhile, we design reasonable editing instructions with the VLM and
implement various scoring mechanisms to filter the data. As a result, we
construct 3.7 million high-quality data with balanced categories. Second, to
better integrate seamlessly with community image generation models, we design
task-aware MoE-LoRA training based on FLUX.1, with only 8\% of the parameters
of the full model. To further improve the final performance, we utilize the
internal representations of the diffusion model and define positive/negative
samples based on image editing types to introduce contrastive learning.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the model's editing performance is
competitive among many excellent models. Additionally, the constructed dataset
exhibits substantial advantages over existing open-source datasets. The
open-source code, checkpoints, and datasets for X2Edit can be found at the

*Hyoung Suk Park,Kiwan Jeon*

TL;DR: 提出一种两阶段方法，通过隐式神经表示（INR）生成先验图像并校正投影数据，以减少牙科CBCT中的截断伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型探测器导致截断视野（FOV），影响迭代重建图像质量，需解决截断伪影问题。

Method: 第一阶段用INR生成先验图像并估计截断误差；第二阶段用校正后的数据进行常规迭代重建。

Result: 数值结果表明，该方法有效抑制截断伪影，提升CBCT图像质量。

Conclusion: 两阶段方法通过INR和迭代重建结合，显著改善牙科CBCT的截断问题。

Abstract: In dental cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), compact and cost-effective
system designs often use small detectors, resulting in a truncated field of
view (FOV) that does not fully encompass the patient's head. In iterative
reconstruction approaches, the discrepancy between the actual projection and
the forward projection within the truncated FOV accumulates over iterations,
leading to significant degradation in the reconstructed image quality. In this
study, we propose a two-stage approach to mitigate truncation artifacts in
dental CBCT. In the first stage, we employ Implicit Neural Representation
(INR), leveraging its superior representation power, to generate a prior image
over an extended region so that its forward projection fully covers the
patient's head. To reduce computational and memory burdens, INR reconstruction
is performed with a coarse voxel size. The forward projection of this prior
image is then used to estimate the discrepancy due to truncated FOV in the
measured projection data. In the second stage, the discrepancy-corrected
projection data is utilized in a conventional iterative reconstruction process
within the truncated region. Our numerical results demonstrate that the
proposed two-grid approach effectively suppresses truncation artifacts, leading
to improved CBCT image quality.

TL;DR: SOFA是一个深度学习框架，通过模拟消融策略和优化参数来预测房颤复发风险并减少复发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 房颤消融手术效果差异大，难以评估和改进。研究旨在通过模拟手术参数预测复发风险并优化消融策略。

Method: SOFA利用多模态、多视图生成器处理2.5D心房图像，模拟消融后疤痕形成并预测复发风险，随后优化手术参数。

Result: SOFA准确合成消融后图像，优化方案使模型预测的复发风险降低22.18%。

Conclusion: SOFA首次整合了手术效果模拟、复发预测和参数优化，为个性化房颤消融提供了新工具。

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a prevalent cardiac arrhythmia often treated with
catheter ablation procedures, but procedural outcomes are highly variable.
Evaluating and improving ablation efficacy is challenging due to the complex
interaction between patient-specific tissue and procedural factors. This paper
asks two questions: Can AF recurrence be predicted by simulating the effects of
procedural parameters? How should we ablate to reduce AF recurrence? We propose
SOFA (Simulating and Optimizing Atrial Fibrillation Ablation), a novel
deep-learning framework that addresses these questions. SOFA first simulates
the outcome of an ablation strategy by generating a post-ablation image
depicting scar formation, conditioned on a patient's pre-ablation LGE-MRI and
the specific procedural parameters used (e.g., ablation locations, duration,
temperature, power, and force). During this simulation, it predicts AF
recurrence risk. Critically, SOFA then introduces an optimization scheme that
refines these procedural parameters to minimize the predicted risk. Our method
leverages a multi-modal, multi-view generator that processes 2.5D
representations of the atrium. Quantitative evaluations show that SOFA
accurately synthesizes post-ablation images and that our optimization scheme
leads to a 22.18\% reduction in the model-predicted recurrence risk. To the
best of our knowledge, SOFA is the first framework to integrate the simulation
of procedural effects, recurrence prediction, and parameter optimization,
offering a novel tool for personalizing AF ablation.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于图神经网络的后期处理流程，利用物体间的空间关系修正检测异常，显著提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态环境中物体空间布局通常一致，但现有检测模型未能充分利用这一先验，导致检测不一致或错误。

Method: 使用图神经网络（GNN）建模物体空间关系，修正异常检测结果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升检测性能，mAP@50最高提升4%。

Conclusion: 利用环境空间结构可显著提升物体检测系统的可靠性。

Abstract: In many real-world applications involving static environments, the spatial
layout of objects remains consistent across instances. However,
state-of-the-art object detection models often fail to leverage this spatial
prior, resulting in inconsistent predictions, missed detections, or
misclassifications, particularly in cluttered or occluded scenes. In this work,
we propose a graph-based post-processing pipeline that explicitly models the
spatial relationships between objects to correct detection anomalies in
egocentric frames. Using a graph neural network (GNN) trained on manually
annotated data, our model identifies invalid object class labels and predicts
corrected class labels based on their neighbourhood context. We evaluate our
approach both as a standalone anomaly detection and correction framework and as
a post-processing module for standard object detectors such as YOLOv7 and
RT-DETR. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating this spatial reasoning
significantly improves detection performance, with mAP@50 gains of up to 4%.
This method highlights the potential of leveraging the environment's spatial
structure to improve reliability in object detection systems.

Conclusion: TER通过置信度模块提升了模型的可靠性和鲁棒性，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Existing emotion recognition methods mainly focus on enhancing performance by
employing complex deep models, typically resulting in significantly higher
model complexity. Although effective, it is also crucial to ensure the
reliability of the final decision, especially for noisy, corrupted and
out-of-distribution data. To this end, we propose a novel emotion recognition
method called trusted emotion recognition (TER), which utilizes uncertainty
estimation to calculate the confidence value of predictions. TER combines the
results from multiple modalities based on their confidence values to output the
trusted predictions. We also provide a new evaluation criterion to assess the
reliability of predictions. Specifically, we incorporate trusted precision and
trusted recall to determine the trusted threshold and formulate the trusted
Acc. and trusted F1 score to evaluate the model's trusted performance. The
proposed framework combines the confidence module that accordingly endows the
model with reliability and robustness against possible noise or corruption. The
extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed
model. The TER achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Music-video,
achieving 82.40% Acc. In terms of trusted performance, TER outperforms other
methods on the IEMOCAP and Music-video, achieving trusted F1 scores of 0.7511

Result: 在CALVIN基准测试和真实实验中表现领先，尤其在少样本场景下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 显式模仿人类动作并通过类比推理映射到机器人操作，能有效提升数据稀缺情况下的性能。

Abstract: Visual Robot Manipulation (VRM) aims to enable a robot to follow natural
language instructions based on robot states and visual observations, and
therefore requires costly multi-modal data. To compensate for the deficiency of
robot data, existing approaches have employed vision-language pretraining with
large-scale data. However, they either utilize web data that differs from
robotic tasks, or train the model in an implicit way (e.g., predicting future
frames at the pixel level), thus showing limited generalization ability under
insufficient robot data. In this paper, we propose to learn from large-scale
human action video datasets in an explicit way (i.e., imitating human actions
from hand keypoints), introducing Visual Robot Manipulation with Analogical
Reasoning (AR-VRM). To acquire action knowledge explicitly from human action
videos, we propose a keypoint Vision-Language Model (VLM) pretraining scheme,
enabling the VLM to learn human action knowledge and directly predict human
hand keypoints. During fine-tuning on robot data, to facilitate the robotic arm
in imitating the action patterns of human motions, we first retrieve human
action videos that perform similar manipulation tasks and have similar
historical observations , and then learn the Analogical Reasoning (AR) map
between human hand keypoints and robot components. Taking advantage of focusing
on action keypoints instead of irrelevant visual cues, our method achieves
leading performance on the CALVIN benchmark {and real-world experiments}. In
few-shot scenarios, our AR-VRM outperforms previous methods by large margins ,
underscoring the effectiveness of explicitly imitating human actions under data
scarcity.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的图像生成算法，通过体积渲染原理精确控制图像中物体的遮挡关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖提示或布局控制遮挡，但缺乏精确性。

Method: 利用预训练扩散模型和体积渲染原理，在潜在空间中根据遮挡关系和物体透射率进行渲染。

Result: 在遮挡精度上显著优于现有方法，并能调整物体透明度、密度等效果。

Conclusion: 该方法无需重新训练模型，实现了物理基础的精确遮挡控制。

Abstract: We propose a novel training-free image generation algorithm that precisely
controls the occlusion relationships between objects in an image. Existing
image generation methods typically rely on prompts to influence occlusion,
which often lack precision. While layout-to-image methods provide control over
object locations, they fail to address occlusion relationships explicitly.
Given a pre-trained image diffusion model, our method leverages volume
rendering principles to "render" the scene in latent space, guided by occlusion
relationships and the estimated transmittance of objects. This approach does
not require retraining or fine-tuning the image diffusion model, yet it enables
accurate occlusion control due to its physics-grounded foundation. In extensive
experiments, our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms
of occlusion accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by adjusting the
opacities of objects or concepts during rendering, our method can achieve a
variety of effects, such as altering the transparency of objects, the density
of mass (e.g., forests), the concentration of particles (e.g., rain, fog), the
intensity of light, and the strength of lens effects, etc.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合散射和深度特征的协作学习方法（CLSDF），用于解决合成孔径雷达（SAR）自动目标识别（ATR）中的噪声标签问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于SAR数据标注需要专业知识，噪声标签不可避免，导致ATR性能下降。现有研究主要针对图像数据，而SAR的非直观视觉特性使其难以实现噪声鲁棒学习。

Method: 设计了多模型特征融合框架，将散射特征与深度特征结合；利用动态图结构数据建模散射中心（ASCs）；通过多类高斯混合模型（GMMs）划分干净和噪声标签样本；基于半监督学习进行分支训练，并引入联合分布对齐策略。

Result: 在MSTAR数据集上的实验表明，该方法在不同噪声条件下均能达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CLSDF方法通过结合物理特征和深度学习，有效提升了SAR ATR在噪声标签下的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: The acquisition of high-quality labeled synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data
is challenging due to the demanding requirement for expert knowledge.
Consequently, the presence of unreliable noisy labels is unavoidable, which
results in performance degradation of SAR automatic target recognition (ATR).
Existing research on learning with noisy labels mainly focuses on image data.
However, the non-intuitive visual characteristics of SAR data are insufficient
to achieve noise-robust learning. To address this problem, we propose
collaborative learning of scattering and deep features (CLSDF) for SAR ATR with
noisy labels. Specifically, a multi-model feature fusion framework is designed
to integrate scattering and deep features. The attributed scattering centers
(ASCs) are treated as dynamic graph structure data, and the extracted physical
characteristics effectively enrich the representation of deep image features.
Then, the samples with clean and noisy labels are divided by modeling the loss
distribution with multiple class-wise Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs).
Afterward, the semi-supervised learning of two divergent branches is conducted
based on the data divided by each other. Moreover, a joint distribution
alignment strategy is introduced to enhance the reliability of co-guessed
labels. Extensive experiments have been done on the Moving and Stationary
Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) dataset, and the results show that
the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance under different
operating conditions with various label noises.

Result: UR-VTON在细节保留和图像质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UR-VTON为虚拟试穿提供了一种高效且无需训练的改进方案。

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VTON) is a crucial task for enhancing user experience in
online shopping by generating realistic garment previews on personal photos.
Although existing methods have achieved impressive results, they struggle with
long-sleeve-to-short-sleeve conversions-a common and practical scenario-often
producing unrealistic outputs when exposed skin is underrepresented in the
original image. We argue that this challenge arises from the ''majority''
completion rule in current VTON models, which leads to inaccurate skin
restoration in such cases. To address this, we propose UR-VTON (Undress-Redress
Virtual Try-ON), a novel, training-free framework that can be seamlessly
integrated with any existing VTON method. UR-VTON introduces an
''undress-to-redress'' mechanism: it first reveals the user's torso by
virtually ''undressing,'' then applies the target short-sleeve garment,
effectively decomposing the conversion into two more manageable steps.
Additionally, we incorporate Dynamic Classifier-Free Guidance scheduling to
balance diversity and image quality during DDPM sampling, and employ Structural
Refiner to enhance detail fidelity using high-frequency cues. Finally, we
present LS-TON, a new benchmark for long-sleeve-to-short-sleeve try-on.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that UR-VTON outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both detail preservation and image quality. Code will be released
upon acceptance.

Result: 实验表明模型达到最优性能，生成可解释且逐步优化的推理链。

Conclusion: TAR-TVG通过显式监督和时间戳锚点，显著提升了时间视频定位的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG) aims to precisely localize video segments
corresponding to natural language queries, which is a critical capability for
long-form video understanding. Although existing reinforcement learning
approaches encourage models to generate reasoning chains before predictions,
they fail to explicitly constrain the reasoning process to ensure the quality
of the final temporal predictions. To address this limitation, we propose
Timestamp Anchor-constrained Reasoning for Temporal Video Grounding (TAR-TVG),
a novel framework that introduces timestamp anchors within the reasoning
process to enforce explicit supervision to the thought content. These anchors
serve as intermediate verification points. More importantly, we require each
reasoning step to produce increasingly accurate temporal estimations, thereby
ensuring that the reasoning process contributes meaningfully to the final
prediction. To address the challenge of low-probability anchor generation in
models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-3B), we develop an efficient self-distillation
training strategy: (1) initial GRPO training to collect 30K high-quality
reasoning traces containing multiple timestamp anchors, (2) supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on distilled data, and (3) final GRPO optimization on the
SFT-enhanced model. This three-stage training strategy enables robust anchor
generation while maintaining reasoning quality. Experiments show that our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance while producing interpretable, verifiable
reasoning chains with progressively refined temporal estimations.

Conclusion: 该方法在多种多视图扩散模型和编辑方法组合下均表现优异，有效解决了信息丢失问题。

Abstract: As 3D generation techniques continue to flourish, the demand for generating
personalized content is rapidly rising. Users increasingly seek to apply
various editing methods to polish generated 3D content, aiming to enhance its
color, style, and lighting without compromising the underlying geometry.
However, most existing editing tools focus on the 2D domain, and directly
feeding their results into 3D generation methods (like multi-view diffusion
models) will introduce information loss, degrading the quality of the final 3D
assets. In this paper, we propose a tuning-free, plug-and-play scheme that
aligns edited assets with their original geometry in a single inference run.
Central to our approach is a geometry preservation module that guides the
edited multi-view generation with original input normal latents. Besides, an
injection switcher is proposed to deliberately control the supervision extent
of the original normals, ensuring the alignment between the edited color and
normal views. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently improves
both the multi-view consistency and mesh quality of edited 3D assets, across
multiple combinations of multi-view diffusion models and editing methods.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves remarkable results in the field of
surface reconstruction. However, when Gaussian normal vectors are aligned
within the single-view projection plane, while the geometry appears reasonable
in the current view, biases may emerge upon switching to nearby views. To
address the distance and global matching challenges in multi-view scenes, we
design multi-view normal and distance-guided Gaussian splatting. This method
achieves geometric depth unification and high-accuracy reconstruction by
constraining nearby depth maps and aligning 3D normals. Specifically, for the
reconstruction of small indoor and outdoor scenes, we propose a multi-view
distance reprojection regularization module that achieves multi-view Gaussian
alignment by computing the distance loss between two nearby views and the same
Gaussian surface. Additionally, we develop a multi-view normal enhancement
module, which ensures consistency across views by matching the normals of pixel
points in nearby views and calculating the loss. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline in both quantitative and
qualitative evaluations, significantly enhancing the surface reconstruction
capability of 3DGS.

Abstract: Accurate detection and classification of diverse door types in floor plans
drawings is critical for multiple applications, such as building compliance
checking, and indoor scene understanding. Despite their importance, publicly
available datasets specifically designed for fine-grained multi-class door
detection remain scarce. In this work, we present a semi-automated pipeline
that leverages a state-of-the-art object detector and a large language model
(LLM) to construct a multi-class door detection dataset with minimal manual
effort. Doors are first detected as a unified category using a deep object
detection model. Next, an LLM classifies each detected instance based on its
visual and contextual features. Finally, a human-in-the-loop stage ensures
high-quality labels and bounding boxes. Our method significantly reduces
annotation cost while producing a dataset suitable for benchmarking neural
models in floor plan analysis. This work demonstrates the potential of
combining deep learning and multimodal reasoning for efficient dataset
construction in complex real-world domains.

Abstract: Image segmentation plays a crucial role in extracting objects of interest and
identifying their boundaries within an image. However, accurate segmentation
becomes challenging when dealing with occlusions, obscurities, or noise in
corrupted images. To tackle this challenge, prior information is often
utilized, with recent attention on star-shape priors. In this paper, we propose
a star-shape segmentation model based on the registration framework. By
combining the level set representation with the registration framework and
imposing constraints on the deformed level set function, our model enables both
full and partial star-shape segmentation, accommodating single or multiple
centers. Additionally, our approach allows for the enforcement of identified
boundaries to pass through specified landmark locations. We tackle the proposed
models using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Through numerical
experiments conducted on synthetic and real images, we demonstrate the efficacy
of our approach in achieving accurate star-shape segmentation.

Abstract: The performance of computer vision models in certain real-world applications,
such as medical diagnosis, is often limited by the scarcity of available
images. Expanding datasets using pre-trained generative models is an effective
solution. However, due to the uncontrollable generation process and the
ambiguity of natural language, noisy images may be generated. Re-weighting is
an effective way to address this issue by assigning low weights to such noisy
images. We first theoretically analyze three types of supervision for the
generated images. Based on the theoretical analysis, we develop TriReWeight, a
triplet-connection-based sample re-weighting method to enhance generative data
augmentation. Theoretically, TriReWeight can be integrated with any generative
data augmentation methods and never downgrade their performance. Moreover, its
generalization approaches the optimal in the order $O(\sqrt{d\ln (n)/n})$. Our
experiments validate the correctness of the theoretical analysis and
demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing SOTA methods by $7.9\%$ on
average over six natural image datasets and by $3.4\%$ on average over three
medical datasets. We also experimentally validate that our method can enhance
the performance of different generative data augmentation methods.

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) image models have demonstrated remarkable

Speculative Decoding (GSD), a novel, training-free acceleration method for AR
image models. While recent studies have explored Speculative Decoding (SD) as a
means to speed up AR image generation, existing approaches either provide only
modest acceleration or require additional training. Our in-depth analysis
reveals a fundamental difference between language and image tokens: image
tokens exhibit inherent redundancy and diversity, meaning multiple tokens can
convey valid semantics. However, traditional SD methods are designed to accept
only a single most-likely token, which fails to leverage this difference,
leading to excessive false-negative rejections. To address this, we propose a
new SD strategy that evaluates clusters of visually valid tokens rather than
relying on a single target token. Additionally, we observe that static
clustering based on embedding distance is ineffective, which motivates our
dynamic GSD approach. Extensive experiments show that GSD accelerates AR image
models by an average of 3.7x while preserving image quality-all without
requiring any additional training. The source code is available at

Result: 实验表明，该方法在概念表示和编辑方面表现均衡且高效，优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 对比反转方法有效提取共同概念，提升生成质量，无需额外信息支持。

Abstract: The recent demand for customized image generation raises a need for
techniques that effectively extract the common concept from small sets of
images. Existing methods typically rely on additional guidance, such as text
prompts or spatial masks, to capture the common target concept. Unfortunately,
relying on manually provided guidance can lead to incomplete separation of
auxiliary features, which degrades generation quality.In this paper, we propose
Contrastive Inversion, a novel approach that identifies the common concept by
comparing the input images without relying on additional information. We train
the target token along with the image-wise auxiliary text tokens via
contrastive learning, which extracts the well-disentangled true semantics of
the target. Then we apply disentangled cross-attention fine-tuning to improve
concept fidelity without overfitting. Experimental results and analysis
demonstrate that our method achieves a balanced, high-level performance in both
concept representation and editing, outperforming existing techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参考分割方法依赖元学习，需要大量数据和计算成本，而CAV-SAM旨在以更轻量的方式解决这一问题。

Method: CAV-SAM包含两个模块：DBST（基于扩散的语义转换）和TTGA（测试时几何对齐），通过伪视频视角利用SAM2的能力。

Result: 在广泛使用的数据集上，CAV-SAM的分割性能比现有最佳方法提高了5%以上。

Conclusion: CAV-SAM为视觉模型在下游任务中的轻量级适应提供了一种有效的新方法。

Abstract: Large vision models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibit significant
limitations when applied to downstream tasks in the wild. Consequently,
reference segmentation, which leverages reference images and their
corresponding masks to impart novel knowledge to the model, emerges as a
promising new direction for adapting vision models. However, existing reference
segmentation approaches predominantly rely on meta-learning, which still
necessitates an extensive meta-training process and brings massive data and
computational cost. In this study, we propose a novel approach by representing
the inherent correspondence between reference-target image pairs as a pseudo
video. This perspective allows the latest version of SAM, known as SAM2, which
is equipped with interactive video object segmentation (iVOS) capabilities, to
be adapted to downstream tasks in a lightweight manner. We term this approach
Correspondence As Video for SAM (CAV-SAM). CAV-SAM comprises two key modules:
the Diffusion-Based Semantic Transition (DBST) module employs a diffusion model
to construct a semantic transformation sequence, while the Test-Time Geometric
Alignment (TTGA) module aligns the geometric changes within this sequence
through test-time fine-tuning. We evaluated CAVSAM on widely-used datasets,
achieving segmentation performance improvements exceeding 5% over SOTA methods.
Implementation is provided in the supplementary materials.

Motivation: 随着AI系统的普及，让AI理解和生成SVG代码变得迫切，但现有方法在SVG的高精度和多模态处理方面存在挑战。

Method: 通过构建包含525k数据项的UniSVG数据集，支持从文本提示和图像生成SVG，以及SVG理解任务，并利用MLLM的多模态处理能力。

Result: 实验表明，基于UniSVG训练的MLLM在SVG理解和生成任务上表现优异，甚至超过GPT-4V等闭源模型。

Conclusion: UniSVG数据集为SVG理解和生成任务提供了统一解决方案，展示了MLLM在此领域的潜力。

Abstract: Unlike bitmap images, scalable vector graphics (SVG) maintain quality when
scaled, frequently employed in computer vision and artistic design in the
representation of SVG code. In this era of proliferating AI-powered systems,
enabling AI to understand and generate SVG has become increasingly urgent.
However, AI-driven SVG understanding and generation (U&G) remain significant
challenges. SVG code, equivalent to a set of curves and lines controlled by
floating-point parameters, demands high precision in SVG U&G. Besides, SVG
generation operates under diverse conditional constraints, including textual
prompts and visual references, which requires powerful multi-modal processing
for condition-to-SVG transformation. Recently, the rapid growth of Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities to process
multi-modal inputs and generate complex vector controlling parameters,
suggesting the potential to address SVG U&G tasks within a unified model. To
unlock MLLM's capabilities in the SVG area, we propose an SVG-centric dataset
called UniSVG, comprising 525k data items, tailored for MLLM training and
evaluation. To our best knowledge, it is the first comprehensive dataset
designed for unified SVG generation (from textual prompts and images) and SVG
understanding (color, category, usage, etc.). As expected, learning on the
proposed dataset boosts open-source MLLMs' performance on various SVG U&G
tasks, surpassing SOTA close-source MLLMs like GPT-4V. We release dataset,

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在保持视角一致性和处理复杂场景动态方面存在困难，尤其是在大规模多元素交互环境中。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：首先通过少样本学习从单图像预测最佳相机轨迹，然后通过姿态条件扩散过程生成几何一致的多视角序列，最终转换为持久4D表示。

Result: 该框架首次结合视频扩散模型的时间先验和重建模型的几何感知，显著提升了4D生成质量（如mPSNR、mSSIM）。

Conclusion: Dream4D通过协同可控视频生成与神经4D重建，为4D内容合成提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: The synthesis of spatiotemporally coherent 4D content presents fundamental
challenges in computer vision, requiring simultaneous modeling of high-fidelity
spatial representations and physically plausible temporal dynamics. Current
approaches often struggle to maintain view consistency while handling complex
scene dynamics, particularly in large-scale environments with multiple
interacting elements. This work introduces Dream4D, a novel framework that
bridges this gap through a synergy of controllable video generation and neural
4D reconstruction. Our approach seamlessly combines a two-stage architecture:
it first predicts optimal camera trajectories from a single image using
few-shot learning, then generates geometrically consistent multi-view sequences
via a specialized pose-conditioned diffusion process, which are finally
converted into a persistent 4D representation. This framework is the first to
leverage both rich temporal priors from video diffusion models and geometric
awareness of the reconstruction models, which significantly facilitates 4D
generation and shows higher quality (e.g., mPSNR, mSSIM) over existing methods.

Motivation: 现有的零样本学习方法中，语义原型通常是手动定义的，可能导致实例级不匹配和类级不精确，从而影响视觉-语义映射的准确性。

Method: CLZSL框架包含两个模块：PCL模块通过课程学习逐步处理样本，优先处理与原型对齐的样本；PUP模块动态更新语义原型以减少类级不精确性。

Result: 在AWA2、SUN和CUB数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: CLZSL通过减少实例级和类级的噪声监督，显著提升了零样本学习的性能。

Abstract: In Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL), embedding-based methods enable knowledge
transfer from seen to unseen classes by learning a visual-semantic mapping from
seen-class images to class-level semantic prototypes (e.g., attributes).
However, these semantic prototypes are manually defined and may introduce noisy
supervision for two main reasons: (i) instance-level mismatch: variations in
perspective, occlusion, and annotation bias will cause discrepancies between
individual sample and the class-level semantic prototypes; and (ii) class-level
imprecision: the manually defined semantic prototypes may not accurately
reflect the true semantics of the class. Consequently, the visual-semantic
mapping will be misled, reducing the effectiveness of knowledge transfer to
unseen classes. In this work, we propose a prototype-guided curriculum learning
framework (dubbed as CLZSL), which mitigates instance-level mismatches through
a Prototype-Guided Curriculum Learning (PCL) module and addresses class-level
imprecision via a Prototype Update (PUP) module. Specifically, the PCL module
prioritizes samples with high cosine similarity between their visual mappings
and the class-level semantic prototypes, and progressively advances to
less-aligned samples, thereby reducing the interference of instance-level
mismatches to achieve accurate visual-semantic mapping. Besides, the PUP module
dynamically updates the class-level semantic prototypes by leveraging the
visual mappings learned from instances, thereby reducing class-level
imprecision and further improving the visual-semantic mapping. Experiments were
conducted on standard benchmark datasets-AWA2, SUN, and CUB-to verify the
effectiveness of our method.

Result: 模型在仿真和真实场景中表现出鲁棒的外推能力，适用于复杂非惯性系统。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂动态系统提供了一种鲁棒且通用的SO(3)外推解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling the rotation of moving objects is a fundamental task in computer
vision, yet $SO(3)$ extrapolation still presents numerous challenges: (1)
unknown quantities such as the moment of inertia complicate dynamics, (2) the
presence of external forces and torques can lead to non-conservative
kinematics, and (3) estimating evolving state trajectories under sparse, noisy
observations requires robustness. We propose modeling trajectories of noisy
pose estimates on the manifold of 3D rotations in a physically and
geometrically meaningful way by leveraging Neural Controlled Differential
Equations guided with $SO(3)$ Savitzky-Golay paths. Existing extrapolation
methods often rely on energy conservation or constant velocity assumptions,
limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios involving non-conservative
forces. In contrast, our approach is agnostic to energy and momentum
conservation while being robust to input noise, making it applicable to
complex, non-inertial systems. Our approach is easily integrated as a module in
existing pipelines and generalizes well to trajectories with unknown physical
parameters. By learning to approximate object dynamics from noisy states during
training, our model attains robust extrapolation capabilities in simulation and
various real-world settings. Code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法通过片段捕捉多尺度时间上下文，显著提升了步态识别性能，展示了片段概念的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in gait recognition have significantly enhanced
performance by treating silhouettes as either an unordered set or an ordered
sequence. However, both set-based and sequence-based approaches exhibit notable
limitations. Specifically, set-based methods tend to overlook short-range
temporal context for individual frames, while sequence-based methods struggle
to capture long-range temporal dependencies effectively. To address these
challenges, we draw inspiration from human identification and propose a new
perspective that conceptualizes human gait as a composition of individualized
actions. Each action is represented by a series of frames, randomly selected
from a continuous segment of the sequence, which we term a snippet.
Fundamentally, the collection of snippets for a given sequence enables the
incorporation of multi-scale temporal context, facilitating more comprehensive
gait feature learning. Moreover, we introduce a non-trivial solution for
snippet-based gait recognition, focusing on Snippet Sampling and Snippet
Modeling as key components. Extensive experiments on four widely-used gait
datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and, more
importantly, highlight the potential of gait snippets. For instance, our method
achieves the rank-1 accuracy of 77.5% on Gait3D and 81.7% on GREW using a 2D
convolution-based backbone.

Motivation: 现有主动防御策略缺乏持久性，攻击者可通过收集受保护样本并重新训练模型绕过防御。

Method: 提出TSDF框架，利用强度分离机制设计双功能对抗扰动，既扭曲伪造结果又破坏攻击者的数据准备过程。

Result: 实验表明，传统防御方法在对抗性重新训练下性能急剧下降，而TSDF展现出强大的双重防御能力。

Conclusion: TSDF通过双功能对抗扰动有效提高主动防御的持久性，确保长期防御效果。

Abstract: Active defense strategies have been developed to counter the threat of
deepfake technology. However, a primary challenge is their lack of persistence,
as their effectiveness is often short-lived. Attackers can bypass these
defenses by simply collecting protected samples and retraining their models.
This means that static defenses inevitably fail when attackers retrain their
models, which severely limits practical use. We argue that an effective defense
not only distorts forged content but also blocks the model's ability to adapt,
which occurs when attackers retrain their models on protected images. To
achieve this, we propose an innovative Two-Stage Defense Framework (TSDF).
Benefiting from the intensity separation mechanism designed in this paper, the
framework uses dual-function adversarial perturbations to perform two roles.
First, it can directly distort the forged results. Second, it acts as a
poisoning vehicle that disrupts the data preparation process essential for an
attacker's retraining pipeline. By poisoning the data source, TSDF aims to
prevent the attacker's model from adapting to the defensive perturbations, thus
ensuring the defense remains effective long-term. Comprehensive experiments
show that the performance of traditional interruption methods degrades sharply
when it is subjected to adversarial retraining. However, our framework shows a
strong dual defense capability, which can improve the persistence of active
defense. Our code will be available at https://github.com/vpsg-research/TSDF.

Abstract: Power batteries are essential components in electric vehicles, where internal
structural defects can pose serious safety risks. We conduct a comprehensive
study on a new task, power battery detection (PBD), which aims to localize the
dense endpoints of cathode and anode plates from industrial X-ray images for
quality inspection. Manual inspection is inefficient and error-prone, while
traditional vision algorithms struggle with densely packed plates, low
contrast, scale variation, and imaging artifacts. To address this issue and
drive more attention into this meaningful task, we present PBD5K, the first
large-scale benchmark for this task, consisting of 5,000 X-ray images from nine
battery types with fine-grained annotations and eight types of real-world
visual interference. To support scalable and consistent labeling, we develop an
intelligent annotation pipeline that combines image filtering, model-assisted
pre-labeling, cross-verification, and layered quality evaluation. We formulate
PBD as a point-level segmentation problem and propose MDCNeXt, a model designed
to extract and integrate multi-dimensional structure clues including point,
line, and count information from the plate itself. To improve discrimination
between plates and suppress visual interference, MDCNeXt incorporates two state
space modules. The first is a prompt-filtered module that learns contrastive
relationships guided by task-specific prompts. The second is a density-aware
reordering module that refines segmentation in regions with high plate density.
In addition, we propose a distance-adaptive mask generation strategy to provide
robust supervision under varying spatial distributions of anode and cathode
positions. The source code and datasets will be publicly available at

Conclusion: MambaTrans在不调整预训练模型参数的情况下，显著改善了多模态图像在下游任务中的表现。

Abstract: The goal of multimodal image fusion is to integrate complementary information
from infrared and visible images, generating multimodal fused images for
downstream tasks. Existing downstream pre-training models are typically trained
on visible images. However, the significant pixel distribution differences
between visible and multimodal fusion images can degrade downstream task
performance, sometimes even below that of using only visible images. This paper
explores adapting multimodal fused images with significant modality differences
to object detection and semantic segmentation models trained on visible images.
To address this, we propose MambaTrans, a novel multimodal fusion image
modality translator. MambaTrans uses descriptions from a multimodal large
language model and masks from semantic segmentation models as input. Its core
component, the Multi-Model State Space Block, combines mask-image-text
cross-attention and a 3D-Selective Scan Module, enhancing pure visual
capabilities. By leveraging object detection prior knowledge, MambaTrans
minimizes detection loss during training and captures long-term dependencies
among text, masks, and images. This enables favorable results in pre-trained
models without adjusting their parameters. Experiments on public datasets show
that MambaTrans effectively improves multimodal image performance in downstream
tasks.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Pose-RFT显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 混合动作强化学习微调对3D姿态生成有效。

Abstract: Generating 3D human poses from multimodal inputs such as images or text
requires models to capture both rich spatial and semantic correspondences.
While pose-specific multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise
in this task, they are typically trained with supervised objectives such as
SMPL parameter regression or token-level prediction, which struggle to model
the inherent ambiguity and achieve task-specific alignment required for
accurate 3D pose generation. To address these limitations, we propose Pose-RFT,
a reinforcement fine-tuning framework tailored for 3D human pose generation in
MLLMs. We formulate the task as a hybrid action reinforcement learning problem
that jointly optimizes discrete language prediction and continuous pose
generation. To this end, we introduce HyGRPO, a hybrid reinforcement learning
algorithm that performs group-wise reward normalization over sampled responses
to guide joint optimization of discrete and continuous actions. Pose-RFT
further incorporates task-specific reward functions to guide optimization
towards spatial alignment in image-to-pose generation and semantic consistency
in text-to-pose generation. Extensive experiments on multiple pose generation
benchmarks demonstrate that Pose-RFT significantly improves performance over
existing pose-specific MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of hybrid action
reinforcement fine-tuning for 3D pose generation.

Motivation: 传统回归方法生成不真实细节且需大量配对数据，生成扩散模型难以保证时间一致性。DiTVR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用扩散变换器与轨迹感知注意力机制，光流轨迹对齐令牌，动态选择相关令牌，流引导采样器注入数据一致性。

Conclusion: DiTVR通过创新注意力机制和采样器设计，显著提升视频修复效果，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Video restoration aims to reconstruct high quality video sequences from low
quality inputs, addressing tasks such as super resolution, denoising, and
deblurring. Traditional regression based methods often produce unrealistic
details and require extensive paired datasets, while recent generative
diffusion models face challenges in ensuring temporal consistency. We introduce
DiTVR, a zero shot video restoration framework that couples a diffusion
transformer with trajectory aware attention and a wavelet guided, flow
consistent sampler. Unlike prior 3D convolutional or frame wise diffusion
approaches, our attention mechanism aligns tokens along optical flow
trajectories, with particular emphasis on vital layers that exhibit the highest
sensitivity to temporal dynamics. A spatiotemporal neighbour cache dynamically
selects relevant tokens based on motion correspondences across frames. The flow
guided sampler injects data consistency only into low-frequency bands,
preserving high frequency priors while accelerating convergence. DiTVR
establishes a new zero shot state of the art on video restoration benchmarks,
demonstrating superior temporal consistency and detail preservation while
remaining robust to flow noise and occlusions.

Motivation: SAR-光学图像匹配因互补性受关注，但现有方法依赖耗时的手动标注，难以获取足够标注数据。

Method: 设计半监督流程，利用伪标签相似性热图结合深度和浅层匹配结果，并引入无监督跨模态特征增强模块。

Result: S2M2-SAR在基准数据集上超越半监督方法，性能接近全监督SOTA方法。

Conclusion: S2M2-SAR高效实用，为SAR-光学图像匹配提供了新思路。

Abstract: Driven by the complementary nature of optical and synthetic aperture radar
(SAR) images, SAR-optical image matching has garnered significant interest.
Most existing SAR-optical image matching methods aim to capture effective
matching features by employing the supervision of pixel-level matched
correspondences within SAR-optical image pairs, which, however, suffers from
time-consuming and complex manual annotation, making it difficult to collect
sufficient labeled SAR-optical image pairs. To handle this, we design a
semi-supervised SAR-optical image matching pipeline that leverages both scarce
labeled and abundant unlabeled image pairs and propose a semi-supervised
multiscale matching for SAR-optical image matching (S2M2-SAR). Specifically, we
pseudo-label those unlabeled SAR-optical image pairs with pseudo ground-truth
similarity heatmaps by combining both deep and shallow level matching results,
and train the matching model by employing labeled and pseudo-labeled similarity
heatmaps. In addition, we introduce a cross-modal feature enhancement module
trained using a cross-modality mutual independence loss, which requires no
ground-truth labels. This unsupervised objective promotes the separation of
modality-shared and modality-specific features by encouraging statistical
independence between them, enabling effective feature disentanglement across
optical and SAR modalities. To evaluate the effectiveness of S2M2-SAR, we
compare it with existing competitors on benchmark datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that S2M2-SAR not only surpasses existing semi-supervised
methods but also achieves performance competitive with fully supervised SOTA
methods, demonstrating its efficiency and practical potential.

Motivation: 现有NR-IQA方法在全局表示或区域特征均匀加权方面存在局限性，无法充分捕捉语义显著区域或局部质量变化。

Method: 利用Segment Anything Model动态分割图像，结合多模态大语言模型提取区域特征，并引入区域感知语义注意力机制整合局部信息。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现出竞争性的质量预测性能。

Conclusion: RSFIQA通过细粒度区域分析和注意力机制，显著提升了图像质量评估的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: No-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) aims to simulate the process
of perceiving image quality aligned with subjective human perception. However,
existing NR-IQA methods either focus on global representations that leads to
limited insights into the semantically salient regions or employ a uniform
weighting for region features that weakens the sensitivity to local quality
variations. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained image quality assessment
model, named RSFIQA, which integrates region-level distortion information to
perceive multi-dimensional quality discrepancies. To enhance regional quality
awareness, we first utilize the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to dynamically
partition the input image into non-overlapping semantic regions. For each
region, we teach a powerful Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to extract
descriptive content and perceive multi-dimensional distortions, enabling a
comprehensive understanding of both local semantics and quality degradations.
To effectively leverage this information, we introduce Region-Aware Semantic
Attention (RSA) mechanism, which generates a global attention map by
aggregating fine-grained representations from local regions. In addition,
RSFIQA is backbone-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into various deep
neural network architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness
and effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves competitive quality
prediction performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种架构协同设计框架，通过卷积低秩适配器和动态融合网关改进视觉语言模型在零样本异常检测中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型在零样本异常检测中存在适应性差距，缺乏局部归纳偏置和灵活的特征融合。

Method: 采用卷积低秩适配器（Conv-LoRA）注入局部归纳偏置，并引入动态融合网关（DFG）自适应调制文本提示。

Result: 在工业和医学基准测试中表现出更高的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 协同设计框架对适应密集感知任务至关重要。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face a significant adaptation gap
when applied to Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD), stemming from their lack of
local inductive biases for dense prediction and their reliance on inflexible
feature fusion paradigms. We address these limitations through an Architectural
Co-Design framework that jointly refines feature representation and cross-modal
fusion. Our method integrates a parameter-efficient Convolutional Low-Rank
Adaptation (Conv-LoRA) adapter to inject local inductive biases for
fine-grained representation, and introduces a Dynamic Fusion Gateway (DFG) that
leverages visual context to adaptively modulate text prompts, enabling a
powerful bidirectional fusion. Extensive experiments on diverse industrial and
medical benchmarks demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness, validating
that this synergistic co-design is critical for robustly adapting foundation
models to dense perception tasks.

TL;DR: MIMIC框架通过合成视觉概念来可视化VLMs的内部表示，提升模型透明度和信任度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs的多模态输入编码复杂且难以解释，限制了透明度和信任。

Method: MIMIC结合VLM反演和特征对齐目标，并引入三种正则化方法（空间对齐、图像平滑、语义真实性）。

Result: 通过定量和定性评估，MIMIC在自由文本输出中成功反演视觉概念，并展示了视觉质量和语义指标。

Conclusion: MIMIC是首个针对VLM视觉概念解释的反演方法，为模型透明度提供了新途径。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) encode multimodal inputs over large, complex,
and difficult-to-interpret architectures, which limit transparency and trust.
We propose a Multimodal Inversion for Model Interpretation and
Conceptualization (MIMIC) framework to visualize the internal representations
of VLMs by synthesizing visual concepts corresponding to internal encodings.
MIMIC uses a joint VLM-based inversion and a feature alignment objective to
account for VLM's autoregressive processing. It additionally includes a triplet
of regularizers for spatial alignment, natural image smoothness, and semantic
realism. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate MIMIC by inverting visual
concepts over a range of varying-length free-form VLM output texts. Reported
results include both standard visual quality metrics as well as semantic
text-based metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model
inversion approach addressing visual interpretations of VLM concepts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管通用视觉语言模型（如CONCH和QuiltNet）在组织病理学中表现出色，但其通用设计可能导致在特定任务中表现不佳。现有监督微调方法需要手动标注样本，限制了其应用。

Method: 通过从现有数据库中提取领域和任务相关的图像-文本对，对VLMs进行无标注的继续预训练。

Result: 实验表明，这种无标注的继续预训练显著提升了零样本和小样本性能，且在大规模训练时能与小样本方法媲美。

Conclusion: 无标注的继续预训练是一种有效的、任务无关的VLM适应方法，适用于组织病理学新任务。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in histopathology, such as
CONCH and QuiltNet, have demonstrated impressive zero-shot classification
capabilities across various tasks. However, their general-purpose design may
lead to suboptimal performance in specific downstream applications. While
supervised fine-tuning methods address this issue, they require manually
labeled samples for adaptation. This paper investigates annotation-free
adaptation of VLMs through continued pretraining on domain- and task-relevant
image-caption pairs extracted from existing databases. Our experiments on two
VLMs, CONCH and QuiltNet, across three downstream tasks reveal that these pairs
substantially enhance both zero-shot and few-shot performance. Notably, with
larger training sizes, continued pretraining matches the performance of
few-shot methods while eliminating manual labeling. Its effectiveness,
task-agnostic design, and annotation-free workflow make it a promising pathway
for adapting VLMs to new histopathology tasks. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BEV多模态方法存在输入适应性有限、建模能力不足和泛化性差的问题，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用分层解耦的混合专家架构（CBDES MoE），结合轻量级自注意力路由机制（SAR），实现动态专家路径选择和高效推理。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，CBDES MoE在mAP和NDS指标上分别比最强单专家模型提高了1.6和4.1个百分点。

Conclusion: CBDES MoE在自动驾驶领域展示了其有效性和实际优势，为BEV感知系统提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception systems based on multi-sensor feature fusion
have become a fundamental cornerstone for end-to-end autonomous driving.
However, existing multi-modal BEV methods commonly suffer from limited input
adaptability, constrained modeling capacity, and suboptimal generalization. To
address these challenges, we propose a hierarchically decoupled
Mixture-of-Experts architecture at the functional module level, termed
Computing Brain DEvelopment System Mixture-of-Experts (CBDES MoE). CBDES MoE
integrates multiple structurally heterogeneous expert networks with a
lightweight Self-Attention Router (SAR) gating mechanism, enabling dynamic
expert path selection and sparse, input-aware efficient inference. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first modular Mixture-of-Experts framework
constructed at the functional module granularity within the autonomous driving
domain. Extensive evaluations on the real-world nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that CBDES MoE consistently outperforms fixed single-expert baselines in 3D
object detection. Compared to the strongest single-expert model, CBDES MoE
achieves a 1.6-point increase in mAP and a 4.1-point improvement in NDS,
demonstrating the effectiveness and practical advantages of the proposed
approach.

Conclusion: Deep SWM为太阳耀斑预测提供了高效可靠的解决方案，并通过公开基准测试验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Accurate, reliable solar flare prediction is crucial for mitigating potential
disruptions to critical infrastructure, while predicting solar flares remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods based on heuristic physical features
often lack representation learning from solar images. On the other hand,
end-to-end learning approaches struggle to model long-range temporal
dependencies in solar images. In this study, we propose Deep Space Weather
Model (Deep SWM), which is based on multiple deep state space models for
handling both ten-channel solar images and long-range spatio-temporal
dependencies. Deep SWM also features a sparse masked autoencoder, a novel
pretraining strategy that employs a two-phase masking approach to preserve
crucial regions such as sunspots while compressing spatial information.
Furthermore, we built FlareBench, a new public benchmark for solar flare
prediction covering a full 11-year solar activity cycle, to validate our
method. Our method outperformed baseline methods and even human expert
performance on standard metrics in terms of performance and reliability. The

Motivation: 研究Ge表面微结构在离子束辐照下的形态变化，探索辐照参数（角度和通量）对形态特性的影响。

Method: 处理电子显微镜图像提取拓扑特征为骨架图，使用图卷积网络嵌入，通过PCA分析嵌入结果，并用Davies-Bouldin指数评估聚类可分性。

Abstract: In this paper, electron microscopy images of microstructures formed on Ge

Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery presents challenges such as dynamic tissue motion
and a limited field of view. Accurate tissue tracking has the potential to
support surgical guidance, improve safety by helping avoid damage to sensitive
structures, and enable context-aware robotic assistance during complex
procedures. In this work, we propose a novel method for markerless 3D tissue
tracking by leveraging 2D Tracking Any Point (TAP) networks. Our method
combines two CoTracker models, one for temporal tracking and one for stereo
matching, to estimate 3D motion from stereo endoscopic images. We evaluate the
system using a clinical laparoscopic setup and a robotic arm simulating tissue
motion, with experiments conducted on a synthetic 3D-printed phantom and a
chicken tissue phantom. Tracking on the chicken tissue phantom yielded more
reliable results, with Euclidean distance errors as low as 1.1 mm at a velocity
of 10 mm/s. These findings highlight the potential of TAP-based models for
accurate, markerless 3D tracking in challenging surgical scenarios.

Conclusion: HuMo100M和Being-M0.5的提出显著推动了运动生成技术的发展，为实际应用提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Human motion generation has emerged as a critical technology with
transformative potential for real-world applications. However, existing
vision-language-motion models (VLMMs) face significant limitations that hinder
their practical deployment. We identify controllability as a main bottleneck,
manifesting in five key aspects: inadequate response to diverse human commands,
limited pose initialization capabilities, poor performance on long-term
sequences, insufficient handling of unseen scenarios, and lack of fine-grained
control over individual body parts. To overcome these limitations, we present
Being-M0.5, the first real-time, controllable VLMM that achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple motion generation tasks. Our
approach is built upon HuMo100M, the largest and most comprehensive human
motion dataset to date, comprising over 5 million self-collected motion
sequences, 100 million multi-task instructional instances, and detailed
part-level annotations that address a critical gap in existing datasets. We
introduce a novel part-aware residual quantization technique for motion
tokenization that enables precise, granular control over individual body parts
during generation. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates Being-M0.5's
superior performance across diverse motion benchmarks, while comprehensive
efficiency analysis confirms its real-time capabilities. Our contributions
include design insights and detailed computational analysis to guide future
development of practical motion generators. We believe that HuMo100M and
Being-M0.5 represent significant advances that will accelerate the adoption of
motion generation technologies in real-world applications. The project page is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对多模态上下文学习（ICL）的上下文自适应令牌剪枝方法（CATP），通过两阶段剪枝减少图像令牌冗余，提升效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像令牌剪枝方法主要针对单图像任务，忽视了多模态ICL中更大的冗余和效率需求，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出CATP，一种无需训练的两阶段剪枝方法，综合考虑跨模态交互，减少冗余图像令牌。

Result: 剪除77.8%的图像令牌后，CATP在四个LVLM和八个基准上平均性能提升0.6%，推理延迟降低10.78%。

Conclusion: CATP提升了多模态ICL的实用价值，为未来图像-文本交织场景的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Modern large vision-language models (LVLMs) convert each input image into a
large set of tokens, far outnumbering the text tokens. Although this improves
visual perception, it introduces severe image token redundancy. Because image
tokens carry sparse information, many add little to reasoning, yet greatly
increase inference cost. The emerging image token pruning methods tackle this
issue by identifying the most important tokens and discarding the rest. These
methods can raise efficiency with only modest performance loss. However, most
of them only consider single-image tasks and overlook multimodal in-context
learning (ICL), where redundancy is greater and efficiency is more critical.
Redundant tokens weaken the advantage of multimodal ICL for rapid domain
adaptation and cause unstable performance. Applying existing pruning methods in
this setting leads to large accuracy drops, exposing a clear gap and the need
for new techniques. Thus, we propose Contextually Adaptive Token Pruning
(CATP), a training-free pruning method targeted at multimodal ICL. CATP
consists of two stages that perform progressive pruning to fully account for
the complex cross-modal interactions in the input sequence. After removing
77.8\% of the image tokens, CATP produces an average performance gain of 0.6\%
over the vanilla model on four LVLMs and eight benchmarks, exceeding all
baselines remarkably. Meanwhile, it effectively improves efficiency by
achieving an average reduction of 10.78\% in inference latency. CATP enhances
the practical value of multimodal ICL and lays the groundwork for future
progress in interleaved image-text scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有WSAG方法依赖分类器，容易关注与功能无关的类特定模式，无法准确识别功能相关部分。

Method: 结合CLIP从第一人称和第三人称图像中发现动作相关对象，并通过多视角交叉参考挖掘功能线索。引入选择性原型和像素对比目标，自适应学习功能相关线索。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效将激活从无关区域转移到功能相关线索上。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多视角学习中显著提升了功能接地的准确性。

Abstract: Facilitating an entity's interaction with objects requires accurately
identifying parts that afford specific actions. Weakly supervised affordance
grounding (WSAG) seeks to imitate human learning from third-person
demonstrations, where humans intuitively grasp functional parts without needing
pixel-level annotations. To achieve this, grounding is typically learned using
a shared classifier across images from different perspectives, along with
distillation strategies incorporating part discovery process. However, since
affordance-relevant parts are not always easily distinguishable, models
primarily rely on classification, often focusing on common class-specific
patterns that are unrelated to affordance. To address this limitation, we move
beyond isolated part-level learning by introducing selective prototypical and
pixel contrastive objectives that adaptively learn affordance-relevant cues at
both the part and object levels, depending on the granularity of the available
information. Initially, we find the action-associated objects in both
egocentric (object-focused) and exocentric (third-person example) images by
leveraging CLIP. Then, by cross-referencing the discovered objects of
complementary views, we excavate the precise part-level affordance clues in
each perspective. By consistently learning to distinguish affordance-relevant
regions from affordance-irrelevant background context, our approach effectively
shifts activation from irrelevant areas toward meaningful affordance cues.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Codes are
available at github.com/hynnsk/SelectiveCL.

Abstract: Image restoration under adverse weather conditions has been extensively
explored, leading to numerous high-performance methods. In particular, recent
advances in All-in-One approaches have shown impressive results by training on
multi-task image restoration datasets. However, most of these methods rely on
dedicated network modules or parameters for each specific degradation type,
resulting in a significant parameter overhead. Moreover, the relatedness across
different restoration tasks is often overlooked. In light of these issues, we
propose a parameter-efficient All-in-One image restoration framework that
leverages task-aware enhanced prompts to tackle various adverse weather
degradations.Specifically, we adopt a two-stage training paradigm consisting of
a pretraining phase and a prompt-tuning phase to mitigate parameter conflicts
across tasks. We first employ supervised learning to acquire general
restoration knowledge, and then adapt the model to handle specific degradation
via trainable soft prompts. Crucially, we enhance these task-specific prompts
in a task-aware manner. We apply low-rank decomposition to these prompts to
capture both task-general and task-specific characteristics, and impose
contrastive constraints to better align them with the actual inter-task
relatedness. These enhanced prompts not only improve the parameter efficiency
of the restoration model but also enable more accurate task modeling, as
evidenced by t-SNE analysis. Experimental results on different restoration
tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance with
only 2.75M parameters.

Abstract: Computer vision-based technologies significantly enhance surgical automation
by advancing tool tracking, detection, and localization. However, Current
data-driven approaches are data-voracious, requiring large, high-quality
labeled image datasets, which limits their application in surgical data
science. Our Work introduces a novel dynamic Gaussian Splatting technique to
address the data scarcity in surgical image datasets. We propose a dynamic
Gaussian model to represent dynamic surgical scenes, enabling the rendering of
surgical instruments from unseen viewpoints and deformations with real tissue
backgrounds. We utilize a dynamic training adjustment strategy to address
challenges posed by poorly calibrated camera poses from real-world scenarios.
Additionally, we propose a method based on dynamic Gaussians for automatically
generating annotations for our synthetic data. For evaluation, we constructed a
new dataset featuring seven scenes with 14,000 frames of tool and camera motion
and tool jaw articulation, with a background of an ex-vivo porcine model. Using
this dataset, we synthetically replicate the scene deformation from the ground
truth data, allowing direct comparisons of synthetic image quality.
Experimental results illustrate that our method generates photo-realistic
labeled image datasets with the highest values in Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(29.87). We further evaluate the performance of medical-specific neural
networks trained on real and synthetic images using an unseen real-world image
dataset. Our results show that the performance of models trained on synthetic
images generated by the proposed method outperforms those trained with
state-of-the-art standard data augmentation by 10%, leading to an overall
improvement in model performances by nearly 15%.

Result: 仅增加约1%参数，视频质量和身份保留效果优于全参数训练方法，并可无缝集成其他任务。

Conclusion: Stand-In框架高效、轻量且兼容性强，适用于多种视频生成任务。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity human videos that match user-specified identities is
important yet challenging in the field of generative AI. Existing methods often
rely on an excessive number of training parameters and lack compatibility with
other AIGC tools. In this paper, we propose Stand-In, a lightweight and
plug-and-play framework for identity preservation in video generation.
Specifically, we introduce a conditional image branch into the pre-trained
video generation model. Identity control is achieved through restricted
self-attentions with conditional position mapping, and can be learned quickly
with only 2000 pairs. Despite incorporating and training just $\sim$1\%
additional parameters, our framework achieves excellent results in video
quality and identity preservation, outperforming other full-parameter training
methods. Moreover, our framework can be seamlessly integrated for other tasks,
such as subject-driven video generation, pose-referenced video generation,
stylization, and face swapping.

Abstract: Handwritten text recognition for historical documents remains challenging due
to handwriting variability, degraded sources, and limited layout-aware
annotations. In this work, we address annotation errors - particularly
hyphenation issues - in the Bullinger correspondence, a large 16th-century
letter collection. We introduce a self-training method based on a CTC alignment
algorithm that matches full transcriptions to text line images using dynamic
programming and model output probabilities trained with the CTC loss. Our
approach improves performance (e.g., by 1.1 percentage points CER with PyLaia)
and increases alignment accuracy. Interestingly, we find that weaker models
yield more accurate alignments, enabling an iterative training strategy. We
release a new manually corrected subset of 100 pages from the Bullinger
dataset, along with our code and benchmarks. Our approach can be applied
iteratively to further improve the CER as well as the alignment quality for
text recognition pipelines. Code and data are available via

Conclusion: 该方法通过预训练和合成数据生成，结合视频扩散模型，显著提升了视频抠图的性能。

Abstract: Video matting has traditionally been limited by the lack of high-quality
ground-truth data. Most existing video matting datasets provide only
human-annotated imperfect alpha and foreground annotations, which must be
composited to background images or videos during the training stage. Thus, the
generalization capability of previous methods in real-world scenarios is
typically poor. In this work, we propose to solve the problem from two
perspectives. First, we emphasize the importance of large-scale pre-training by
pursuing diverse synthetic and pseudo-labeled segmentation datasets. We also
develop a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline that can render diverse
human bodies and fine-grained hairs, yielding around 200 video clips with a
3-second duration for fine-tuning. Second, we introduce a novel video matting
approach that can effectively leverage the rich priors from pre-trained video
diffusion models. This architecture offers two key advantages. First, strong
priors play a critical role in bridging the domain gap between synthetic and
real-world scenes. Second, unlike most existing methods that process video
matting frame-by-frame and use an independent decoder to aggregate temporal
information, our model is inherently designed for video, ensuring strong
temporal consistency. We provide a comprehensive quantitative evaluation across
three benchmark datasets, demonstrating our approach's superior performance,
and present comprehensive qualitative results in diverse real-world scenes,
illustrating the strong generalization capability of our method. The code is

TL;DR: Mem4D提出了一种双内存架构，分别处理静态结构和动态运动，解决了单目视频动态场景重建中的内存需求困境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在静态结构长期稳定性和动态运动高保真细节保留之间的内存冲突问题。

Method: 设计双内存架构：瞬态动态内存（TDM）捕捉高频运动细节，持久结构内存（PSM）压缩长期空间信息。

Result: 在挑战性基准测试中表现优异，同时保持高效性。

Conclusion: Mem4D通过解耦静态和动态建模，实现了高保真动态重建和全局一致的静态结构。

Abstract: Reconstructing dense geometry for dynamic scenes from a monocular video is a
critical yet challenging task. Recent memory-based methods enable efficient
online reconstruction, but they fundamentally suffer from a Memory Demand
Dilemma: The memory representation faces an inherent conflict between the
long-term stability required for static structures and the rapid, high-fidelity
detail retention needed for dynamic motion. This conflict forces existing
methods into a compromise, leading to either geometric drift in static
structures or blurred, inaccurate reconstructions of dynamic objects. To
address this dilemma, we propose Mem4D, a novel framework that decouples the
modeling of static geometry and dynamic motion. Guided by this insight, we
design a dual-memory architecture: 1) The Transient Dynamics Memory (TDM)
focuses on capturing high-frequency motion details from recent frames, enabling
accurate and fine-grained modeling of dynamic content; 2) The Persistent
Structure Memory (PSM) compresses and preserves long-term spatial information,
ensuring global consistency and drift-free reconstruction for static elements.
By alternating queries to these specialized memories, Mem4D simultaneously
maintains static geometry with global consistency and reconstructs dynamic
elements with high fidelity. Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance while
maintaining high efficiency. Codes will be publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遥感VQA数据集在标注丰富性、问题多样性和推理能力评估方面存在局限性，亟需一个更全面的数据集来推动研究。

Method: 通过整合多个遥感分割和检测数据集，并利用GPT-4.1设计双轨标注生成流程，自动生成详细标注和复杂问答对，同时开发专门的对象计数自动化流程。

Result: RSVLM-QA包含13,820张图像和162,373个VQA对，标注丰富且问题类型多样，能有效评估当前主流视觉语言模型的理解和推理能力。

Conclusion: RSVLM-QA将成为遥感VQA和视觉语言模型研究的重要资源，推动该领域的进步。

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) in remote sensing (RS) is pivotal for
interpreting Earth observation data. However, existing RS VQA datasets are
constrained by limitations in annotation richness, question diversity, and the
assessment of specific reasoning capabilities. This paper introduces RSVLM-QA
dataset, a new large-scale, content-rich VQA dataset for the RS domain.
RSVLM-QA is constructed by integrating data from several prominent RS
segmentation and detection datasets: WHU, LoveDA, INRIA, and iSAID. We employ
an innovative dual-track annotation generation pipeline. Firstly, we leverage
Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4.1, with meticulously designed
prompts to automatically generate a suite of detailed annotations including
image captions, spatial relations, and semantic tags, alongside complex
caption-based VQA pairs. Secondly, to address the challenging task of object
counting in RS imagery, we have developed a specialized automated process that
extracts object counts directly from the original segmentation data; GPT-4.1
then formulates natural language answers from these counts, which are paired
with preset question templates to create counting QA pairs. RSVLM-QA comprises
13,820 images and 162,373 VQA pairs, featuring extensive annotations and
diverse question types. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the
dataset and a comparison with existing RS VQA benchmarks, highlighting the
superior depth and breadth of RSVLM-QA's annotations. Furthermore, we conduct
benchmark experiments on Six mainstream Vision Language Models (VLMs),
demonstrating that RSVLM-QA effectively evaluates and challenges the
understanding and reasoning abilities of current VLMs in the RS domain. We
believe RSVLM-QA will serve as a pivotal resource for the RS VQA and VLM
research communities, poised to catalyze advancements in the field.

detection framework to safeguard GenAI models in BIOEMTECH's eyes(TM) systems.
Two applications are demonstrated: Pose2Xray, which generates synthetic X-rays
from photographic mouse images, and DosimetrEYE, which estimates 3D radiation
dose maps from 2D SPECT/CT scans. In both cases, our outlier detection (OD)
enhances reliability, reduces manual oversight, and supports real-time quality
control. This approach strengthens the industrial viability of GenAI in
preclinical settings by increasing robustness, scalability, and regulatory
compliance.

Motivation: 现有零样本视频时间定位方法存在语义碎片化和相似性分布偏差问题，且依赖昂贵的LLMs推理。

Method: 提出TAG方法，结合时间池化、时间一致性聚类和相似性调整，无需训练即可捕捉视频时间上下文并修正相似性分布。

Result: 在Charades-STA和ActivityNet Captions基准数据集上取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: TAG是一种简单有效的零样本视频时间定位方法，解决了现有方法的局限性，且不依赖LLMs。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to extract relevant video segments based
on a given natural language query. Recently, zero-shot VTG methods have gained
attention by leveraging pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to localize
target moments without additional training. However, existing approaches suffer
from semantic fragmentation, where temporally continuous frames sharing the
same semantics are split across multiple segments. When segments are
fragmented, it becomes difficult to predict an accurate target moment that
aligns with the text query. Also, they rely on skewed similarity distributions
for localization, making it difficult to select the optimal segment.
Furthermore, they heavily depend on the use of LLMs which require expensive
inferences. To address these limitations, we propose a \textit{TAG}, a simple
yet effective Temporal-Aware approach for zero-shot video temporal Grounding,
which incorporates temporal pooling, temporal coherence clustering, and
similarity adjustment. Our proposed method effectively captures the temporal
context of videos and addresses distorted similarity distributions without
training. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on Charades-STA and
ActivityNet Captions benchmark datasets without rely on LLMs. Our code is

Conclusion: VOIDFace 提升了面部识别训练中的隐私、安全和效率，同时增强了对敏感数据的控制。

Abstract: Advancement of machine learning techniques, combined with the availability of
large-scale datasets, has significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of
facial recognition. Modern facial recognition systems are trained using large
face datasets collected from diverse individuals or public repositories.
However, for training, these datasets are often replicated and stored in
multiple workstations, resulting in data replication, which complicates
database management and oversight. Currently, once a user submits their face
for dataset preparation, they lose control over how their data is used, raising
significant privacy and ethical concerns. This paper introduces VOIDFace, a
novel framework for facial recognition systems that addresses two major issues.
First, it eliminates the need of data replication and improves data control to
securely store training face data by using visual secret sharing. Second, it
proposes a patch-based multi-training network that uses this novel training
data storage mechanism to develop a robust, privacy-preserving facial
recognition system. By integrating these advancements, VOIDFace aims to improve
the privacy, security, and efficiency of facial recognition training, while
ensuring greater control over sensitive personal face data. VOIDFace also
enables users to exercise their Right-To-Be-Forgotten property to control their
personal data. Experimental evaluations on the VGGFace2 dataset show that
VOIDFace provides Right-To-Be-Forgotten, improved data control, security, and
privacy while maintaining competitive facial recognition performance. Code is

Conclusion: 3D几何信息使持久身份跟踪成为可能，支持手术室中个性化智能系统的开发与应用。

Abstract: Providing intelligent support to surgical teams is a key frontier in
automated surgical scene understanding, with the long-term goal of improving
patient outcomes. Developing personalized intelligence for all staff members
requires maintaining a consistent state of who is located where for long
surgical procedures, which still poses numerous computational challenges. We
propose TrackOR, a framework for tackling long-term multi-person tracking and
re-identification in the operating room. TrackOR uses 3D geometric signatures
to achieve state-of-the-art online tracking performance (+11% Association
Accuracy over the strongest baseline), while also enabling an effective offline
recovery process to create analysis-ready trajectories. Our work shows that by
leveraging 3D geometric information, persistent identity tracking becomes
attainable, enabling a critical shift towards the more granular, staff-centric
analyses required for personalized intelligent systems in the operating room.
This new capability opens up various applications, including our proposed
temporal pathway imprints that translate raw tracking data into actionable
insights for improving team efficiency and safety and ultimately providing
personalized support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VFX生成方法受限于单效果训练，无法满足多效果空间可控的需求，亟需统一框架解决干扰和空间控制问题。

Method: 提出LoRA-MoE（专家LoRA组）和SAP（空间感知提示）技术，结合IIF模块隔离控制信号，构建Omni-VFX数据集支持研究。

Result: 实验表明Omni-Effects能精确控制空间位置并生成多样效果，用户可指定效果类别和位置。

Conclusion: Omni-Effects为VFX生成提供了首个统一框架，解决了多效果干扰和空间控制难题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are essential visual enhancements fundamental to modern
cinematic production. Although video generation models offer cost-efficient
solutions for VFX production, current methods are constrained by per-effect
LoRA training, which limits generation to single effects. This fundamental
limitation impedes applications that require spatially controllable composite
effects, i.e., the concurrent generation of multiple effects at designated
locations. However, integrating diverse effects into a unified framework faces
major challenges: interference from effect variations and spatial
uncontrollability during multi-VFX joint training. To tackle these challenges,
we propose Omni-Effects, a first unified framework capable of generating
prompt-guided effects and spatially controllable composite effects. The core of
our framework comprises two key innovations: (1) LoRA-based Mixture of Experts
(LoRA-MoE), which employs a group of expert LoRAs, integrating diverse effects
within a unified model while effectively mitigating cross-task interference.
(2) Spatial-Aware Prompt (SAP) incorporates spatial mask information into the
text token, enabling precise spatial control. Furthermore, we introduce an
Independent-Information Flow (IIF) module integrated within the SAP, isolating
the control signals corresponding to individual effects to prevent any unwanted
blending. To facilitate this research, we construct a comprehensive VFX dataset
Omni-VFX via a novel data collection pipeline combining image editing and
First-Last Frame-to-Video (FLF2V) synthesis, and introduce a dedicated VFX
evaluation framework for validating model performance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Omni-Effects achieves precise spatial control and diverse
effect generation, enabling users to specify both the category and location of
desired effects.

Motivation: 揭示当前模型在动态环境中感知连续运动的不足，及其对用户信任的影响。

Method: 通过‘电梯问题’作为典型案例，分析帧采样范式在视频理解中的局限性。

Result: 指出模型在低信号连续运动感知上的根本性缺陷，强调其对实际应用的负面影响。

Conclusion: 呼吁从语义识别转向物理感知，开发以用户需求为中心的新基准，提升安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold immense promise as assistive
technologies for the blind and visually impaired (BVI) community. However, we
identify a critical failure mode that undermines their trustworthiness in
real-world applications. We introduce the Escalator Problem -- the inability of
state-of-the-art models to perceive an escalator's direction of travel -- as a
canonical example of a deeper limitation we term Implicit Motion Blindness.
This blindness stems from the dominant frame-sampling paradigm in video
understanding, which, by treating videos as discrete sequences of static
images, fundamentally struggles to perceive continuous, low-signal motion. As a
position paper, our contribution is not a new model but rather to: (I) formally
articulate this blind spot, (II) analyze its implications for user trust, and
(III) issue a call to action. We advocate for a paradigm shift from purely
semantic recognition towards robust physical perception and urge the
development of new, human-centered benchmarks that prioritize safety,
reliability, and the genuine needs of users in dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉基础模型（VFMs）在群体动态建模中表现不足，需要结构化、群体感知的推理方法。

Method: 引入可学习的群体提示和两层的GroupContext Transformer，以推断演员-群体关联和集体行为。

Result: 在Cafe和Social-CAD基准测试中超越现有方法，尤其在多群体场景中提升显著（Group mAP@1.0提升6.5%，Group mAP@0.5提升8.2%）。

Conclusion: ProGraD不仅性能优越，还能生成可解释的注意力图，为群体推理提供洞察。

Abstract: Group Activity Detection (GAD) involves recognizing social groups and their
collective behaviors in videos. Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), like DinoV2,
offer excellent features, but are pretrained primarily on object-centric data
and remain underexplored for modeling group dynamics. While they are a
promising alternative to highly task-specific GAD architectures that require
full fine-tuning, our initial investigation reveals that simply swapping CNN
backbones used in these methods with VFMs brings little gain, underscoring the
need for structured, group-aware reasoning on top.
  We introduce Prompt-driven Group Activity Detection (ProGraD) -- a method
that bridges this gap through 1) learnable group prompts to guide the VFM
attention toward social configurations, and 2) a lightweight two-layer
GroupContext Transformer that infers actor-group associations and collective
behavior. We evaluate our approach on two recent GAD benchmarks: Cafe, which
features multiple concurrent social groups, and Social-CAD, which focuses on
single-group interactions. While we surpass state-of-the-art in both settings,
our method is especially effective in complex multi-group scenarios, where we
yield a gain of 6.5\% (Group mAP\@1.0) and 8.2\% (Group mAP\@0.5) using only
10M trainable parameters. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that ProGraD
produces interpretable attention maps, offering insights into actor-group
reasoning. Code and models will be released.

Result: SRA在ImageNet上达到78.31%的Top-1准确率，性能接近基于搜索的方法，且兼容现有增强流程。

Conclusion: SRA为自动数据增强提供了一种更简单、有效且实用的设计，适用于多种未来任务。

Abstract: Automatic data augmentation (AutoDA) plays an important role in enhancing the
generalization of neural networks. However, mainstream AutoDA methods often
encounter two challenges: either the search process is excessively
time-consuming, hindering practical application, or the performance is
suboptimal due to insufficient policy adaptation during training. To address
these issues, we propose Sample-aware RandAugment (SRA), an asymmetric,
search-free AutoDA method that dynamically adjusts augmentation policies while
maintaining straightforward implementation. SRA incorporates a heuristic
scoring module that evaluates the complexity of the original training data,
enabling the application of tailored augmentations for each sample.
Additionally, an asymmetric augmentation strategy is employed to maximize the
potential of this scoring module. In multiple experimental settings, SRA
narrows the performance gap between search-based and search-free AutoDA
methods, achieving a state-of-the-art Top-1 accuracy of 78.31\% on ImageNet
with ResNet-50. Notably, SRA demonstrates good compatibility with existing
augmentation pipelines and solid generalization across new tasks, without
requiring hyperparameter tuning. The pretrained models leveraging SRA also
enhance recognition in downstream object detection tasks. SRA represents a
promising step towards simpler, more effective, and practical AutoDA designs
applicable to a variety of future tasks. Our code is available at

Result: 实验显示，在真实临床环境中，RGB模型性能下降12%，而几何方法因捕捉更有意义的生物特征表现更优。

Conclusion: 几何表示能有效避免外观干扰，为手术室中人员建模提供了更鲁棒的方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are prone to learning spurious correlations, exploiting
dataset-specific artifacts rather than meaningful features for prediction. In
surgical operating rooms (OR), these manifest through the standardization of
smocks and gowns that obscure robust identifying landmarks, introducing model
bias for tasks related to modeling OR personnel. Through gradient-based
saliency analysis on two public OR datasets, we reveal that CNN models succumb
to such shortcuts, fixating on incidental visual cues such as footwear beneath
surgical gowns, distinctive eyewear, or other role-specific identifiers.
Avoiding such biases is essential for the next generation of intelligent
assistance systems in the OR, which should accurately recognize personalized
workflow traits, such as surgical skill level or coordination with other staff
members. We address this problem by encoding personnel as 3D point cloud
sequences, disentangling identity-relevant shape and motion patterns from
appearance-based confounders. Our experiments demonstrate that while RGB and
geometric methods achieve comparable performance on datasets with apparent
simulation artifacts, RGB models suffer a 12% accuracy drop in realistic
clinical settings with decreased visual diversity due to standardizations. This
performance gap confirms that geometric representations capture more meaningful
biometric features, providing an avenue to developing robust methods of
modeling humans in the OR.

Result: 在KITTI和nuScenes数据集上验证，MAE提升12.87%，RMSE提升9.08%。

Conclusion: TRIDE通过多模态融合和天气适应机制显著提升了深度估计的准确性。

Abstract: Depth estimation, essential for autonomous driving, seeks to interpret the 3D
environment surrounding vehicles. The development of radar sensors, known for
their cost-efficiency and robustness, has spurred interest in radar-camera
fusion-based solutions. However, existing algorithms fuse features from these
modalities without accounting for weather conditions, despite radars being
known to be more robust than cameras under adverse weather. Additionally, while
Vision-Language models have seen rapid advancement, utilizing language
descriptions alongside other modalities for depth estimation remains an open
challenge. This paper first introduces a text-generation strategy along with
feature extraction and fusion techniques that can assist monocular depth
estimation pipelines, leading to improved accuracy across different algorithms
on the KITTI dataset. Building on this, we propose TRIDE, a radar-camera fusion
algorithm that enhances text feature extraction by incorporating radar point
information. To address the impact of weather on sensor performance, we
introduce a weather-aware fusion block that adaptively adjusts radar weighting
based on current weather conditions. Our method, benchmarked on the nuScenes
dataset, demonstrates performance gains over the state-of-the-art, achieving a
12.87% improvement in MAE and a 9.08% improvement in RMSE. Code:

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练即可生成高质量3D视频，为沉浸式应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While video generation models excel at producing high-quality monocular
videos, generating 3D stereoscopic and spatial videos for immersive
applications remains an underexplored challenge. We present a pose-free and
training-free method that leverages an off-the-shelf monocular video generation
model to produce immersive 3D videos. Our approach first warps the generated
monocular video into pre-defined camera viewpoints using estimated depth
information, then applies a novel \textit{frame matrix} inpainting framework.
This framework utilizes the original video generation model to synthesize
missing content across different viewpoints and timestamps, ensuring spatial
and temporal consistency without requiring additional model fine-tuning.
Moreover, we develop a \dualupdate~scheme that further improves the quality of
video inpainting by alleviating the negative effects propagated from
disoccluded areas in the latent space. The resulting multi-view videos are then
adapted into stereoscopic pairs or optimized into 4D Gaussians for spatial
video synthesis. We validate the efficacy of our proposed method by conducting
experiments on videos from various generative models, such as Sora, Lumiere,
WALT, and Zeroscope. The experiments demonstrate that our method has a
significant improvement over previous methods. Project page at:

Abstract: Accelerating Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reduces scan time but often
degrades image quality. While Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) show
promise for MRI reconstruction, they struggle at high acceleration factors due
to weak prior constraints, leading to structural loss and aliasing artefacts.
To address this, we propose PrIINeR, an INR-based MRI reconstruction method
that integrates prior knowledge from pre-trained deep learning models into the
INR framework. By combining population-level knowledge with instance-based

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于信息瓶颈的因果注意力方法（IBCA），用于医学图像的多标签分类，通过过滤无关特征并增强因果注意力，显著提升了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在医学图像多标签分类中难以区分因果和无关特征，导致诊断准确性受限。

Method: 提出结构因果模型（SCM）和IBCA方法，利用高斯混合多标签空间注意力过滤无关信息，并通过对比增强因果干预减少噪声。

Result: 在Endo和MuReD数据集上，IBCA在多个指标上显著优于其他方法，如CR、OR和mAP等。

Conclusion: IBCA通过有效学习类特定注意力，提升了医学图像多标签分类的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) of medical images aims to identify multiple
diseases and holds significant clinical potential. A critical step is to learn
class-specific features for accurate diagnosis and improved interpretability
effectively. However, current works focus primarily on causal attention to
learn class-specific features, yet they struggle to interpret the true cause
due to the inadvertent attention to class-irrelevant features. To address this
challenge, we propose a new structural causal model (SCM) that treats
class-specific attention as a mixture of causal, spurious, and noisy factors,
and a novel Information Bottleneck-based Causal Attention (IBCA) that is
capable of learning the discriminative class-specific attention for MLC of
medical images. Specifically, we propose learning Gaussian mixture multi-label
spatial attention to filter out class-irrelevant information and capture each
class-specific attention pattern. Then a contrastive enhancement-based causal
intervention is proposed to gradually mitigate the spurious attention and
reduce noise information by aligning multi-head attention with the Gaussian
mixture multi-label spatial. Quantitative and ablation results on Endo and
MuReD show that IBCA outperforms all methods. Compared to the second-best
results for each metric, IBCA achieves improvements of 6.35\% in CR, 7.72\% in
OR, and 5.02\% in mAP for MuReD, 1.47\% in CR, and 1.65\% in CF1, and 1.42\% in
mAP for Endo.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在微表情分析中存在固定窗口长度和硬分类的局限性，且将微表情定位与识别视为独立任务，忽略了其内在联系。

Result: 实验表明，所提方法在性能上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 通过状态空间模型和多任务协同策略，显著提升了微表情分析的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are regarded as important indicators of an
individual's intrinsic emotions, preferences, and tendencies. ME analysis
requires spotting of ME intervals within long video sequences and recognition
of their corresponding emotional categories. Previous deep learning approaches
commonly employ sliding-window classification networks. However, the use of
fixed window lengths and hard classification presents notable limitations in
practice. Furthermore, these methods typically treat ME spotting and
recognition as two separate tasks, overlooking the essential relationship
between them. To address these challenges, this paper proposes two state space
model-based architectures, namely ME-TST and ME-TST+, which utilize temporal
state transition mechanisms to replace conventional window-level classification
with video-level regression. This enables a more precise characterization of
the temporal dynamics of MEs and supports the modeling of MEs with varying
durations. In ME-TST+, we further introduce multi-granularity ROI modeling and
the slowfast Mamba framework to alleviate information loss associated with
treating ME analysis as a time-series task. Additionally, we propose a synergy
strategy for spotting and recognition at both the feature and result levels,
leveraging their intrinsic connection to enhance overall analysis performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve
state-of-the-art performance. The codes are available at

Abstract: Explorable 3D world generation from a single image or text prompt forms a
cornerstone of spatial intelligence. Recent works utilize video model to
achieve wide-scope and generalizable 3D world generation. However, existing
approaches often suffer from a limited scope in the generated scenes. In this
work, we propose Matrix-3D, a framework that utilize panoramic representation
for wide-coverage omnidirectional explorable 3D world generation that combines
conditional video generation and panoramic 3D reconstruction. We first train a
trajectory-guided panoramic video diffusion model that employs scene mesh
renders as condition, to enable high-quality and geometrically consistent scene
video generation. To lift the panorama scene video to 3D world, we propose two
separate methods: (1) a feed-forward large panorama reconstruction model for
rapid 3D scene reconstruction and (2) an optimization-based pipeline for
accurate and detailed 3D scene reconstruction. To facilitate effective
training, we also introduce the Matrix-Pano dataset, the first large-scale
synthetic collection comprising 116K high-quality static panoramic video
sequences with depth and trajectory annotations. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance
in panoramic video generation and 3D world generation. See more in

Abstract: Depression is a major mental health condition that severely impacts the
emotional and physical well-being of individuals. The simple nature of data
collection from social media platforms has attracted significant interest in
properly utilizing this information for mental health research. A Multimodal
Depression Detection Network (MDD-Net), utilizing acoustic and visual data
obtained from social media networks, is proposed in this work where mutual
transformers are exploited to efficiently extract and fuse multimodal features
for efficient depression detection. The MDD-Net consists of four core modules:
an acoustic feature extraction module for retrieving relevant acoustic
attributes, a visual feature extraction module for extracting significant
high-level patterns, a mutual transformer for computing the correlations among
the generated features and fusing these features from multiple modalities, and
a detection layer for detecting depression using the fused feature
representations. The extensive experiments are performed using the multimodal
D-Vlog dataset, and the findings reveal that the developed multimodal
depression detection network surpasses the state-of-the-art by up to 17.37% for
F1-Score, demonstrating the greater performance of the proposed system. The

Result: 提取的3D根骨架与真实情况高度相似，验证了模型的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法可提升育种效率，减少人工干预，推动现代农业智能化发展。

Abstract: Plant roots typically exhibit a highly complex and dense architecture,
incorporating numerous slender lateral roots and branches, which significantly
hinders the precise capture and modeling of the entire root system.
Additionally, roots often lack sufficient texture and color information, making
it difficult to identify and track root traits using visual methods. Previous
research on roots has been largely confined to 2D studies; however, exploring
the 3D architecture of roots is crucial in botany. Since roots grow in real 3D
space, 3D phenotypic information is more critical for studying genetic traits
and their impact on root development. We have introduced a 3D root skeleton
extraction method that efficiently derives the 3D architecture of plant roots
from a few images. This method includes the detection and matching of lateral
roots, triangulation to extract the skeletal structure of lateral roots, and
the integration of lateral and primary roots. We developed a highly complex
root dataset and tested our method on it. The extracted 3D root skeletons
showed considerable similarity to the ground truth, validating the
effectiveness of the model. This method can play a significant role in
automated breeding robots. Through precise 3D root structure analysis, breeding
robots can better identify plant phenotypic traits, especially root structure
and growth patterns, helping practitioners select seeds with superior root
systems. This automated approach not only improves breeding efficiency but also
reduces manual intervention, making the breeding process more intelligent and
efficient, thus advancing modern agriculture.

Motivation: 现有扩散统一模型存在两个主要问题：一是生成条件仅依赖MLLM的最终隐藏状态，导致浅层连接；二是从头训练统一生成架构计算成本高。

Conclusion: 该方法为多模态理解与生成提供了一种高效且深入的统一范式。

Abstract: This paper introduces TBAC-UniImage, a novel unified model for multimodal
understanding and generation. We achieve this by deeply integrating a
pre-trained Diffusion Model, acting as a generative ladder, with a Multimodal
Large Language Model (MLLM). Previous diffusion-based unified models face two
primary limitations. One approach uses only the MLLM's final hidden state as
the generative condition. This creates a shallow connection, as the generator
is isolated from the rich, hierarchical representations within the MLLM's
intermediate layers. The other approach, pretraining a unified generative
architecture from scratch, is computationally expensive and prohibitive for
many researchers. To overcome these issues, our work explores a new paradigm.
Instead of relying on a single output, we use representations from multiple,
diverse layers of the MLLM as generative conditions for the diffusion model.
This method treats the pre-trained generator as a ladder, receiving guidance
from various depths of the MLLM's understanding process. Consequently,
TBAC-UniImage achieves a much deeper and more fine-grained unification of
understanding and generation.

deep learning. Representative applications across Earth observation, precision
agriculture, biomedicine, industrial inspection, cultural heritage, and
security are also discussed, emphasizing HSI's ability to uncover sub-visual

complexity of high-dimensional data, are examined alongside emerging solutions,
including computational imaging, physics-informed modeling, cross-modal fusion,

miniaturization, self-supervised learning, and foundation models. As HSI
evolves into a general-purpose, cross-disciplinary platform, it holds promise
for transformative applications in science, technology, and society.

Conclusion: GRASPTrack通过几何感知和动态调整机制，有效提升了多目标跟踪在复杂场景中的性能。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in monocular videos is fundamentally challenged
by occlusions and depth ambiguity, issues that conventional
tracking-by-detection (TBD) methods struggle to resolve owing to a lack of
geometric awareness. To address these limitations, we introduce GRASPTrack, a
novel depth-aware MOT framework that integrates monocular depth estimation and
instance segmentation into a standard TBD pipeline to generate high-fidelity 3D
point clouds from 2D detections, thereby enabling explicit 3D geometric
reasoning. These 3D point clouds are then voxelized to enable a precise and
robust Voxel-Based 3D Intersection-over-Union (IoU) for spatial association. To
further enhance tracking robustness, our approach incorporates Depth-aware
Adaptive Noise Compensation, which dynamically adjusts the Kalman filter
process noise based on occlusion severity for more reliable state estimation.
Additionally, we propose a Depth-enhanced Observation-Centric Momentum, which
extends the motion direction consistency from the image plane into 3D space to
improve motion-based association cues, particularly for objects with complex
trajectories. Extensive experiments on the MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance,
significantly improving tracking robustness in complex scenes with frequent
occlusions and intricate motion patterns.

Result: 实验证明该方法在编辑能力和视觉保真度上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模形状编辑提供了一种高效且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: While recent flow-based image editing models demonstrate general-purpose
capabilities across diverse tasks, they often struggle to specialize in
challenging scenarios -- particularly those involving large-scale shape
transformations. When performing such structural edits, these methods either
fail to achieve the intended shape change or inadvertently alter non-target
regions, resulting in degraded background quality. We propose
Follow-Your-Shape, a training-free and mask-free framework that supports
precise and controllable editing of object shapes while strictly preserving
non-target content. Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing
trajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing
token-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The
TDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV
Injection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a
rigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120
new images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware
editing. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior editability
and visual fidelity, particularly in tasks requiring large-scale shape
replacement.

Conclusion: FantasyStyle通过创新的技术解决了3D风格迁移中的关键问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The success of 3DGS in generative and editing applications has sparked
growing interest in 3DGS-based style transfer. However, current methods still
face two major challenges: (1) multi-view inconsistency often leads to style
conflicts, resulting in appearance smoothing and distortion; and (2) heavy
reliance on VGG features, which struggle to disentangle style and content from
style images, often causing content leakage and excessive stylization. To
tackle these issues, we introduce \textbf{FantasyStyle}, a 3DGS-based style
transfer framework, and the first to rely entirely on diffusion model
distillation. It comprises two key components: (1) \textbf{Multi-View Frequency
Consistency}. We enhance cross-view consistency by applying a 3D filter to
multi-view noisy latent, selectively reducing low-frequency components to
mitigate stylized prior conflicts. (2) \textbf{Controllable Stylized
Distillation}. To suppress content leakage from style images, we introduce
negative guidance to exclude undesired content. In addition, we identify the
limitations of Score Distillation Sampling and Delta Denoising Score in 3D
style transfer and remove the reconstruction term accordingly. Building on
these insights, we propose a controllable stylized distillation that leverages
negative guidance to more effectively optimize the 3D Gaussians. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches, achieving higher stylization quality and visual
realism across various scenes and styles.

Conclusion: TUNA方法通过结合任务特定和通用适配器的预测，有效利用了专业和通用知识，提升了类增量学习的性能。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires a learning system to continually
learn new classes without forgetting. Existing pre-trained model-based CIL
methods often freeze the pre-trained network and adapt to incremental tasks
using additional lightweight modules such as adapters. However, incorrect
module selection during inference hurts performance, and task-specific modules
often overlook shared general knowledge, leading to errors on distinguishing
between similar classes across tasks. To address the aforementioned challenges,
we propose integrating Task-Specific and Universal Adapters (TUNA) in this
paper. Specifically, we train task-specific adapters to capture the most
crucial features relevant to their respective tasks and introduce an
entropy-based selection mechanism to choose the most suitable adapter.
Furthermore, we leverage an adapter fusion strategy to construct a universal
adapter, which encodes the most discriminative features shared across tasks. We
combine task-specific and universal adapter predictions to harness both
specialized and general knowledge during inference. Extensive experiments on
various benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our
approach. Code is available at: https://github.com/LAMDA-CL/ICCV2025-TUNA

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升端到端自动驾驶训练质量，缩小仿真与现实差距。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning for training end-to-end autonomous driving models in
closed-loop simulations is gaining growing attention. However, most simulation
environments differ significantly from real-world conditions, creating a
substantial simulation-to-reality (sim2real) gap. To bridge this gap, some
approaches utilize scene reconstruction techniques to create photorealistic
environments as a simulator. While this improves realistic sensor simulation,
these methods are inherently constrained by the distribution of the training
data, making it difficult to render high-quality sensor data for novel
trajectories or corner case scenarios. Therefore, we propose ReconDreamer-RL, a
framework designed to integrate video diffusion priors into scene
reconstruction to aid reinforcement learning, thereby enhancing end-to-end
autonomous driving training. Specifically, in ReconDreamer-RL, we introduce
ReconSimulator, which combines the video diffusion prior for appearance
modeling and incorporates a kinematic model for physical modeling, thereby
reconstructing driving scenarios from real-world data. This narrows the
sim2real gap for closed-loop evaluation and reinforcement learning. To cover
more corner-case scenarios, we introduce the Dynamic Adversary Agent (DAA),
which adjusts the trajectories of surrounding vehicles relative to the ego
vehicle, autonomously generating corner-case traffic scenarios (e.g., cut-in).
Finally, the Cousin Trajectory Generator (CTG) is proposed to address the issue
of training data distribution, which is often biased toward simple
straight-line movements. Experiments show that ReconDreamer-RL improves
end-to-end autonomous driving training, outperforming imitation learning
methods with a 5x reduction in the Collision Ratio.

Abstract: Large-scale scientific simulations require significant resources to generate
high-resolution time-varying data (TVD). While super-resolution is an efficient
post-processing strategy to reduce costs, existing methods rely on a large
amount of HR training data, limiting their applicability to diverse simulation
scenarios. To address this constraint, we proposed CD-TVD, a novel framework
that combines contrastive learning and an improved diffusion-based
super-resolution model to achieve accurate 3D super-resolution from limited
time-step high-resolution data. During pre-training on historical simulation
data, the contrastive encoder and diffusion superresolution modules learn
degradation patterns and detailed features of high-resolution and
low-resolution samples. In the training phase, the improved diffusion model
with a local attention mechanism is fine-tuned using only one newly generated
high-resolution timestep, leveraging the degradation knowledge learned by the
encoder. This design minimizes the reliance on large-scale high-resolution
datasets while maintaining the capability to recover fine-grained details.
Experimental results on fluid and atmospheric simulation datasets confirm that
CD-TVD delivers accurate and resource-efficient 3D super-resolution, marking a
significant advancement in data augmentation for large-scale scientific

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的医学视觉-语言任务UMRG，并发布了数据集U-MRG-14K，同时提出了MedReasoner框架，通过强化学习优化推理模块，实现了医学图像区域定位的先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学图像区域定位方法依赖显式空间提示，无法处理临床实践中的隐式查询，亟需一种结合临床推理和像素级定位的新方法。

Method: 提出了UMRG任务和U-MRG-14K数据集，并设计MedReasoner框架，将推理与分割模块分离，通过强化学习优化推理模块。

Result: MedReasoner在U-MRG-14K数据集上达到先进性能，并能泛化到未见过的临床查询。

Conclusion: 强化学习在可解释的医学图像区域定位中具有显著潜力。

Abstract: Accurately grounding regions of interest (ROIs) is critical for diagnosis and
treatment planning in medical imaging. While multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) combine visual perception with natural language, current
medical-grounding pipelines still rely on supervised fine-tuning with explicit
spatial hints, making them ill-equipped to handle the implicit queries common
in clinical practice. This work makes three core contributions. We first define
Unified Medical Reasoning Grounding (UMRG), a novel vision-language task that
demands clinical reasoning and pixel-level grounding. Second, we release
U-MRG-14K, a dataset of 14K samples featuring pixel-level masks alongside
implicit clinical queries and reasoning traces, spanning 10 modalities, 15
super-categories, and 108 specific categories. Finally, we introduce
MedReasoner, a modular framework that distinctly separates reasoning from
segmentation: an MLLM reasoner is optimized with reinforcement learning, while
a frozen segmentation expert converts spatial prompts into masks, with
alignment achieved through format and accuracy rewards. MedReasoner achieves
state-of-the-art performance on U-MRG-14K and demonstrates strong
generalization to unseen clinical queries, underscoring the significant promise
of reinforcement learning for interpretable medical grounding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于RGBD相机的3D人体网格估计方法M$^3$，利用虚拟相机投影模拟深度数据，并通过掩码自编码器补全部分视图网格，显著提升了精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGBD相机虽普及但深度数据在3D人体网格估计中未充分利用，且现有数据集规模小、多样性不足。

Method: 利用MoCap数据集生成虚拟单视图深度数据，训练掩码自编码器补全网格，匹配传感器深度值生成完整网格。

Result: 在SURREAL、CAPE和BEHAVE数据集上分别达到16.8mm、22.0mm和70.9mm的PVE，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: M$^3$方法有效利用深度数据，显著提升了单视图3D人体网格估计的精度。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in 3D human mesh estimation from RGB images;
RGBD cameras, offering additional depth data, remain underutilized. In this
paper, we present a method for accurate 3D human mesh estimation from a single
RGBD view, leveraging the affordability and widespread adoption of RGBD cameras
for real-world applications. A fully supervised approach for this problem,
requires a dataset with RGBD image and 3D mesh label pairs. However, collecting
such a dataset is costly and challenging, hence, existing datasets are small,
and limited in pose and shape diversity. To overcome this data scarcity, we
leverage existing Motion Capture (MoCap) datasets. We first obtain complete 3D
meshes from the body models found in MoCap datasets, and create partial,
single-view versions of them by projection to a virtual camera. This simulates
the depth data provided by an RGBD camera from a single viewpoint. Then, we
train a masked autoencoder to complete the partial, single-view mesh. During
inference, our method, which we name as M$^3$ for ``Masked Mesh Modeling'',
matches the depth values coming from the sensor to vertices of a template human
mesh, which creates a partial, single-view mesh. We effectively recover parts
of the 3D human body mesh model that are not visible, resulting in a full body
mesh. M$^3$ achieves 16.8 mm and 22.0 mm per-vertex-error (PVE) on the SURREAL
and CAPE datasets, respectively; outperforming existing methods that use
full-body point clouds as input. We obtain a competitive 70.9 PVE on the BEHAVE
dataset, outperforming a recently published RGB based method by 18.4 mm,
highlighting the usefulness of depth data. Code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种物理标注方法和PP-Motion指标，用于评估人体运动生成的物理和感知保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在评估运动保真度时存在人类感知与物理可行性之间的差距，且主观的二元标注限制了数据驱动指标的开发。

Method: 通过计算运动与物理定律的最小修改量来生成细粒度的物理对齐标注，并基于此提出PP-Motion指标，结合皮尔逊相关损失和人类感知损失进行训练。

Result: 实验表明，PP-Motion在物理和感知保真度上均优于先前工作。

Conclusion: PP-Motion为运动生成提供了一种更全面的保真度评估方法。

Abstract: Human motion generation has found widespread applications in AR/VR, film,
sports, and medical rehabilitation, offering a cost-effective alternative to
traditional motion capture systems. However, evaluating the fidelity of such
generated motions is a crucial, multifaceted task. Although previous approaches
have attempted at motion fidelity evaluation using human perception or physical
constraints, there remains an inherent gap between human-perceived fidelity and
physical feasibility. Moreover, the subjective and coarse binary labeling of
human perception further undermines the development of a robust data-driven
metric. We address these issues by introducing a physical labeling method. This
method evaluates motion fidelity by calculating the minimum modifications
needed for a motion to align with physical laws. With this approach, we are
able to produce fine-grained, continuous physical alignment annotations that
serve as objective ground truth. With these annotations, we propose PP-Motion,
a novel data-driven metric to evaluate both physical and perceptual fidelity of
human motion. To effectively capture underlying physical priors, we employ
Pearson's correlation loss for the training of our metric. Additionally, by
incorporating a human-based perceptual fidelity loss, our metric can capture
fidelity that simultaneously considers both human perception and physical
alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our metric, PP-Motion, not
only aligns with physical laws but also aligns better with human perception of
motion fidelity than previous work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer方法在高光谱图像融合中存在冗余令牌表示和多尺度特征建模不足的问题，且难以保留高频成分和局部细节。

Method: 提出了THAT框架，包括Pivotal Token Selective Attention（PTSA）和Multi-level Variance-aware Feed-forward Network（MVFN），分别用于优化令牌选择和增强高频细节学习。

Result: 实验表明，THAT在标准基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，提升了重建质量和效率。

Conclusion: THAT通过改进高频特征表示和令牌选择，显著提升了高光谱图像融合的效果，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have demonstrated strong potential in hyperspectral
pansharpening by modeling long-range dependencies. However, their effectiveness
is often limited by redundant token representations and a lack of multi-scale
feature modeling. Hyperspectral images exhibit intrinsic spectral priors (e.g.,
abundance sparsity) and spatial priors (e.g., non-local similarity), which are
critical for accurate reconstruction. From a spectral-spatial perspective,
Vision Transformers (ViTs) face two major limitations: they struggle to
preserve high-frequency components--such as material edges and texture
transitions--and suffer from attention dispersion across redundant tokens.
These issues stem from the global self-attention mechanism, which tends to
dilute high-frequency signals and overlook localized details. To address these
challenges, we propose the Token-wise High-frequency Augmentation Transformer
(THAT), a novel framework designed to enhance hyperspectral pansharpening
through improved high-frequency feature representation and token selection.
Specifically, THAT introduces: (1) Pivotal Token Selective Attention (PTSA) to
prioritize informative tokens and suppress redundancy; (2) a Multi-level
Variance-aware Feed-forward Network (MVFN) to enhance high-frequency detail
learning. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that THAT achieves
state-of-the-art performance with improved reconstruction quality and
efficiency. The source code is available at https://github.com/kailuo93/THAT.

TL;DR: KARMA是一种高效的语义分割框架，通过一维函数组合建模复杂缺陷模式，显著减少参数数量，适用于实时基础设施检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有深度学习方法参数过多、难以实时应用的问题，同时处理缺陷外观多变、成像条件恶劣和类别不平衡的挑战。

Method: 引入Tiny Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (TiKAN)模块、优化的特征金字塔结构和静态-动态原型机制。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优异，参数减少97%（0.959M vs. 31.04M），推理速度适合实时部署。

Conclusion: KARMA为基础设施自动化检测提供了高效、实用的解决方案，不牺牲准确性。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of structural defects in civil infrastructure remains
challenging due to variable defect appearances, harsh imaging conditions, and
significant class imbalance. Current deep learning methods, despite their
effectiveness, typically require millions of parameters, rendering them
impractical for real-time inspection systems. We introduce KARMA
(Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Mapping Architecture), a highly efficient
semantic segmentation framework that models complex defect patterns through
compositions of one-dimensional functions rather than conventional
convolutions. KARMA features three technical innovations: (1) a
parameter-efficient Tiny Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (TiKAN) module leveraging
low-rank factorization for KAN-based feature transformation; (2) an optimized
feature pyramid structure with separable convolutions for multi-scale defect
analysis; and (3) a static-dynamic prototype mechanism that enhances feature
representation for imbalanced classes. Extensive experiments on benchmark
infrastructure inspection datasets demonstrate that KARMA achieves competitive
or superior mean IoU performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while
using significantly fewer parameters (0.959M vs. 31.04M, a 97% reduction).
Operating at 0.264 GFLOPS, KARMA maintains inference speeds suitable for
real-time deployment, enabling practical automated infrastructure inspection
systems without compromising accuracy. The source code can be accessed at the

Abstract: Recent advances at the intersection of reinforcement learning (RL) and visual
intelligence have enabled agents that not only perceive complex visual scenes
but also reason, generate, and act within them. This survey offers a critical
and up-to-date synthesis of the field. We first formalize visual RL problems
and trace the evolution of policy-optimization strategies from RLHF to
verifiable reward paradigms, and from Proximal Policy Optimization to Group
Relative Policy Optimization. We then organize more than 200 representative
works into four thematic pillars: multi-modal large language models, visual
generation, unified model frameworks, and vision-language-action models. For
each pillar we examine algorithmic design, reward engineering, benchmark
progress, and we distill trends such as curriculum-driven training,
preference-aligned diffusion, and unified reward modeling. Finally, we review
evaluation protocols spanning set-level fidelity, sample-level preference, and
state-level stability, and we identify open challenges that include sample
efficiency, generalization, and safe deployment. Our goal is to provide
researchers and practitioners with a coherent map of the rapidly expanding
landscape of visual RL and to highlight promising directions for future
inquiry. Resources are available at:

TL;DR: Spatial-ORMLLM是一种仅使用RGB模态的大型视觉语言模型，用于手术室中的3D空间推理，解决了现有方法在多模态数据获取和2D数据细节不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术室中的精确空间建模对临床任务至关重要，但现有方法依赖多模态数据且忽略3D能力，导致数据获取困难和细节缺失。

Method: 提出Spatial-ORMLLM，通过空间增强特征融合块将2D输入与3D空间知识结合，采用端到端框架实现3D场景推理。

Result: 在多个临床数据集上表现优异，泛化能力强，适用于未见过的场景和任务。

Conclusion: Spatial-ORMLLM为手术室3D空间建模提供了高效且无需额外标注的解决方案。

Abstract: Precise spatial modeling in the operating room (OR) is foundational to many
clinical tasks, supporting intraoperative awareness, hazard avoidance, and
surgical decision-making. While existing approaches leverage large-scale
multimodal datasets for latent-space alignment to implicitly learn spatial
relationships, they overlook the 3D capabilities of MLLMs. However, this
approach raises two issues: (1) Operating rooms typically lack multiple video
and audio sensors, making multimodal 3D data difficult to obtain; (2) Training
solely on readily available 2D data fails to capture fine-grained details in
complex scenes. To address this gap, we introduce Spatial-ORMLLM, the first
large vision-language model for 3D spatial reasoning in operating rooms using
only RGB modality to infer volumetric and semantic cues, enabling downstream
medical tasks with detailed and holistic spatial context. Spatial-ORMLLM
incorporates a Spatial-Enhanced Feature Fusion Block, which integrates 2D
modality inputs with rich 3D spatial knowledge extracted by the estimation
algorithm and then feeds the combined features into the visual tower. By
employing a unified end-to-end MLLM framework, it combines powerful spatial
features with textual features to deliver robust 3D scene reasoning without any
additional expert annotations or sensor inputs. Experiments on multiple
benchmark clinical datasets demonstrate that Spatial-ORMLLM achieves
state-of-the-art performance and generalizes robustly to previously unseen
surgical scenarios and downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D高斯场景分割方法存在计算成本高、空间推理能力有限以及无法同时跟踪多对象的问题。

Method: 结合视频基础模型（如SAM2）进行2D掩码传播，并采用GPU加速的3D掩码生成和高斯级实例标记算法。

Result: 在NVOS和Spin-NeRF基准测试中表现优异（92.7%和95.2% mIoU），推理速度提升15-1500倍（27毫秒/帧）。

Conclusion: SAGOnline为实时渲染和3D场景理解提供了高效解决方案，适用于AR/VR和机器人应用。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for explicit
3D scene representation, yet achieving efficient and consistent 3D segmentation
remains challenging. Current methods suffer from prohibitive computational
costs, limited 3D spatial reasoning, and an inability to track multiple objects
simultaneously. We present Segment Any Gaussians Online (SAGOnline), a
lightweight and zero-shot framework for real-time 3D segmentation in Gaussian
scenes that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a
decoupled strategy that integrates video foundation models (e.g., SAM2) for
view-consistent 2D mask propagation across synthesized views; and (2) a
GPU-accelerated 3D mask generation and Gaussian-level instance labeling
algorithm that assigns unique identifiers to 3D primitives, enabling lossless
multi-object tracking and segmentation across views. SAGOnline achieves
state-of-the-art performance on NVOS (92.7% mIoU) and Spin-NeRF (95.2% mIoU)
benchmarks, outperforming Feature3DGS, OmniSeg3D-gs, and SA3D by 15--1500 times
in inference speed (27 ms/frame). Qualitative results demonstrate robust
multi-object segmentation and tracking in complex scenes. Our contributions
include: (i) a lightweight and zero-shot framework for 3D segmentation in
Gaussian scenes, (ii) explicit labeling of Gaussian primitives enabling
simultaneous segmentation and tracking, and (iii) the effective adaptation of
2D video foundation models to the 3D domain. This work allows real-time
rendering and 3D scene understanding, paving the way for practical AR/VR and
robotic applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型的方法，通过对比偏好损失和偏好标记学习个性化用户偏好，显著提升了偏好预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖通用偏好或静态用户画像，忽略了用户偏好的动态性和多样性，无法全面捕捉个体差异。

Method: 采用多模态大语言模型，引入对比偏好损失和可学习的偏好标记，区分用户喜好并捕捉群体共享兴趣表示。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在偏好预测准确性上优于其他方法，能有效识别相似审美倾向的用户，并生成更符合个体口味的图像。

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态捕捉用户偏好，显著提升了预测精度和个性化推荐效果。

Abstract: User preference prediction requires a comprehensive and accurate
understanding of individual tastes. This includes both surface-level
attributes, such as color and style, and deeper content-related aspects, such
as themes and composition. However, existing methods typically rely on general
human preferences or assume static user profiles, often neglecting individual
variability and the dynamic, multifaceted nature of personal taste. To address
these limitations, we propose an approach built upon Multimodal Large Language
Models, introducing contrastive preference loss and preference tokens to learn
personalized user preferences from historical interactions. The contrastive
preference loss is designed to effectively distinguish between user ''likes''
and ''dislikes'', while the learnable preference tokens capture shared interest
representations among existing users, enabling the model to activate
group-specific preferences and enhance consistency across similar users.
Extensive experiments demonstrate our model outperforms other methods in
preference prediction accuracy, effectively identifying users with similar
aesthetic inclinations and providing more precise guidance for generating
images that align with individual tastes. The project page is

<details>

Motivation: 现有一步式真实图像超分辨率模型在初始时间步注入低质量图像潜在分布时，与高斯噪声潜在分布存在差距，限制了生成先验的有效利用。

Method: 提出OMGSR框架，在预计算的中期时间步注入低质量图像潜在分布，引入潜在分布细化损失和重叠分块LPIPS/GAN损失。

Result: OMGSR-S/F在512分辨率下表现优异，OMGSR-F在所有参考指标中占据主导地位，1k和2k分辨率下也取得出色结果。

Conclusion: OMGSR通过中期时间步引导和优化损失设计，有效提升了一步式真实图像超分辨率的性能，尤其在细节生成上表现突出。

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and Flow Matching (FM)
generative models show promising potential for one-step Real-World Image
Super-Resolution (Real-ISR). Recent one-step Real-ISR models typically inject a
Low-Quality (LQ) image latent distribution at the initial timestep. However, a
fundamental gap exists between the LQ image latent distribution and the
Gaussian noisy latent distribution, limiting the effective utilization of
generative priors. We observe that the noisy latent distribution at DDPM/FM
mid-timesteps aligns more closely with the LQ image latent distribution. Based
on this insight, we present One Mid-timestep Guidance Real-ISR (OMGSR), a
universal framework applicable to DDPM/FM-based generative models. OMGSR
injects the LQ image latent distribution at a pre-computed mid-timestep,
incorporating the proposed Latent Distribution Refinement loss to alleviate the
latent distribution gap. We also design the Overlap-Chunked LPIPS/GAN loss to
eliminate checkerboard artifacts in image generation. Within this framework, we
instantiate OMGSR for DDPM/FM-based generative models with two variants:
OMGSR-S (SD-Turbo) and OMGSR-F (FLUX.1-dev). Experimental results demonstrate
that OMGSR-S/F achieves balanced/excellent performance across quantitative and
qualitative metrics at 512-resolution. Notably, OMGSR-F establishes
overwhelming dominance in all reference metrics. We further train a
1k-resolution OMGSR-F to match the default resolution of FLUX.1-dev, which
yields excellent results, especially in the details of the image generation. We
also generate 2k-resolution images by the 1k-resolution OMGSR-F using our
two-stage Tiled VAE & Diffusion.

TL;DR: 论文提出Next Shot Generation (NSG)框架Cut2Next，通过Diffusion Transformer和Hierarchical Multi-Prompting策略生成符合专业剪辑模式的高质量后续镜头。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法多注重基础视觉一致性，忽略了推动叙事的剪辑模式（如正反打镜头、插入镜头），导致输出缺乏叙事复杂性和电影完整性。

Method: 采用Diffusion Transformer (DiT)和Hierarchical Multi-Prompting策略（包括Relational Prompts和Individual Prompts），结合Context-Aware Condition Injection (CACI)和Hierarchical Attention Mask (HAM)技术。

Result: 实验表明Cut2Next在视觉一致性和文本保真度上表现优异，用户研究显示其更符合剪辑模式和电影连续性。

Conclusion: Cut2Next能生成高质量、叙事表达丰富且电影连贯的后续镜头，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Effective multi-shot generation demands purposeful, film-like transitions and
strict cinematic continuity. Current methods, however, often prioritize basic
visual consistency, neglecting crucial editing patterns (e.g., shot/reverse
shot, cutaways) that drive narrative flow for compelling storytelling. This
yields outputs that may be visually coherent but lack narrative sophistication
and true cinematic integrity. To bridge this, we introduce Next Shot Generation
(NSG): synthesizing a subsequent, high-quality shot that critically conforms to
professional editing patterns while upholding rigorous cinematic continuity.
Our framework, Cut2Next, leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT). It employs
in-context tuning guided by a novel Hierarchical Multi-Prompting strategy. This
strategy uses Relational Prompts to define overall context and inter-shot
editing styles. Individual Prompts then specify per-shot content and
cinematographic attributes. Together, these guide Cut2Next to generate
cinematically appropriate next shots. Architectural innovations, Context-Aware
Condition Injection (CACI) and Hierarchical Attention Mask (HAM), further
integrate these diverse signals without introducing new parameters. We
construct RawCuts (large-scale) and CuratedCuts (refined) datasets, both with
hierarchical prompts, and introduce CutBench for evaluation. Experiments show
Cut2Next excels in visual consistency and text fidelity. Crucially, user
studies reveal a strong preference for Cut2Next, particularly for its adherence
to intended editing patterns and overall cinematic continuity, validating its
ability to generate high-quality, narratively expressive, and cinematically
coherent subsequent shots.

Motivation: 现有音频驱动的虚拟化身视频生成模型难以生成长视频且音频同步和身份一致性差，StableAvatar旨在解决这些问题。

Method: StableAvatar通过时间步感知音频适配器和音频原生引导机制改进音频建模，并采用动态加权滑动窗口策略增强视频流畅性。

Result: 实验证明StableAvatar在质量和定量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: StableAvatar为无限长度视频生成提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了音频同步和身份一致性。

Abstract: Current diffusion models for audio-driven avatar video generation struggle to
synthesize long videos with natural audio synchronization and identity
consistency. This paper presents StableAvatar, the first end-to-end video
diffusion transformer that synthesizes infinite-length high-quality videos
without post-processing. Conditioned on a reference image and audio,
StableAvatar integrates tailored training and inference modules to enable
infinite-length video generation. We observe that the main reason preventing
existing models from generating long videos lies in their audio modeling. They
typically rely on third-party off-the-shelf extractors to obtain audio
embeddings, which are then directly injected into the diffusion model via
cross-attention. Since current diffusion backbones lack any audio-related
priors, this approach causes severe latent distribution error accumulation
across video clips, leading the latent distribution of subsequent segments to
drift away from the optimal distribution gradually. To address this,
StableAvatar introduces a novel Time-step-aware Audio Adapter that prevents
error accumulation via time-step-aware modulation. During inference, we propose
a novel Audio Native Guidance Mechanism to further enhance the audio
synchronization by leveraging the diffusion's own evolving joint audio-latent
prediction as a dynamic guidance signal. To enhance the smoothness of the
infinite-length videos, we introduce a Dynamic Weighted Sliding-window Strategy
that fuses latent over time. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness
of StableAvatar both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: R3DGS任务和ReferSplat框架为3D多模态理解提供了新方向，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: We introduce Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS), a new task
that aims to segment target objects in a 3D Gaussian scene based on natural
language descriptions, which often contain spatial relationships or object
attributes. This task requires the model to identify newly described objects
that may be occluded or not directly visible in a novel view, posing a
significant challenge for 3D multi-modal understanding. Developing this
capability is crucial for advancing embodied AI. To support research in this
area, we construct the first R3DGS dataset, Ref-LERF. Our analysis reveals that
3D multi-modal understanding and spatial relationship modeling are key
challenges for R3DGS. To address these challenges, we propose ReferSplat, a
framework that explicitly models 3D Gaussian points with natural language
expressions in a spatially aware paradigm. ReferSplat achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both the newly proposed R3DGS task and 3D open-vocabulary
segmentation benchmarks. Dataset and code are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于物理约束的神经网络方法，从单张图像生成4D场景（包含3D几何和运动），解决了现有方法中运动预测不物理一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 提出了一种物理约束的神经网络，预测每个表面点的运动，并通过Navier-Stokes方程等物理原理指导损失函数。同时，从输入图像和深度估计中预测基于特征的3D高斯分布，并通过预测的运动进行动画渲染。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能生成物理一致的动画，性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了从单张图像生成物理一致的4D场景，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Humans possess an exceptional ability to imagine 4D scenes, encompassing both
motion and 3D geometry, from a single still image. This ability is rooted in
our accumulated observations of similar scenes and an intuitive understanding
of physics. In this paper, we aim to replicate this capacity in neural
networks, specifically focusing on natural fluid imagery. Existing methods for
this task typically employ simplistic 2D motion estimators to animate the
image, leading to motion predictions that often defy physical principles,
resulting in unrealistic animations. Our approach introduces a novel method for
generating 4D scenes with physics-consistent animation from a single image. We
propose the use of a physics-informed neural network that predicts motion for
each surface point, guided by a loss term derived from fundamental physical
principles, including the Navier-Stokes equations. To capture appearance, we
predict feature-based 3D Gaussians from the input image and its estimated
depth, which are then animated using the predicted motions and rendered from
any desired camera perspective. Experimental results highlight the
effectiveness of our method in producing physically plausible animations,
showcasing significant performance improvements over existing methods. Our

### [317] [Solving Pasur Using GPU-Accelerated Counterfactual Regret Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06559)
*Sina Baghal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种基于CUDA加速的计算框架，用于模拟Pasur游戏，并通过CFR算法计算近纳什均衡。框架通过高效内存管理和游戏树分解解决了游戏规则复杂性和内存需求大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pasur游戏的复杂规则和大规模游戏树带来了独特的计算挑战，需要高效的计算框架来解决。

Method: 使用PyTorch CUDA张量处理规则复杂性，将游戏树分解为实际游戏状态和继承分数，并通过逐轮反向训练策略管理计算复杂度。

Result: 构建了包含超过10^9个节点的完整游戏树，并训练了基于树的模型预测策略，通过大规模自玩估计每副牌的公平价值。

Conclusion: 该框架可扩展到其他强化学习算法，适用于多轮分解的动作树场景。

Abstract: Pasur is a fishing card game played over six rounds and is played similarly
to games such as Cassino and Scopa, and Bastra. This paper introduces a
CUDA-accelerated computational framework for simulating Pasur, emphasizing
efficient memory management. We use our framework to compute near-Nash
equilibria via Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR), a well-known algorithm
for solving large imperfect-information games.
  Solving Pasur presents unique challenges due to its intricate rules and the
large size of its game tree. We handle rule complexity using PyTorch CUDA
tensors and to address the memory-intensive nature of the game, we decompose
the game tree into two key components: (1) actual game states, and (2)
inherited scores from previous rounds. We construct the Full Game Tree by
pairing card states with accumulated scores in the Unfolding Process. This
design reduces memory overhead by storing only essential strategy values and
node connections. To further manage computational complexity, we apply a
round-by-round backward training strategy, starting from the final round and
recursively propagating average utilities to earlier stages. Our approach
constructs the complete game tree, which on average consists of over $10^9$
nodes. We provide detailed implementation snippets.
  After computing a near-Nash equilibrium strategy, we train a tree-based model
to predict these strategies for use during gameplay. We then estimate the fair
value of each deck through large-scale self-play between equilibrium strategies
by simulating, for instance, 10,000 games per matchup, executed in parallel
using GPU acceleration.
  Similar frameworks can be extended to other reinforcement learning algorithms
where the action tree naturally decomposes into multiple rounds such as
turn-based strategy games or sequential trading decisions in financial markets.

TL;DR: SciLink是一个开源的多智能体AI框架，旨在通过自动化链接实验观察、新颖性评估和理论模拟，在材料研究中实现偶然发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代自动化实验室虽高效但可能忽视偶然发现，SciLink旨在填补这一空白，促进科学探索中的意外发现。

Method: 采用混合AI策略，结合机器学习模型和大型语言模型，将原始数据转化为可验证的科学主张，并评估其新颖性。

Result: SciLink在多种研究场景中表现出色，能够整合实时专家指导并提出针对性后续实验。

Conclusion: SciLink不仅提升效率，还创造了一个有利于偶然发现的环境，弥合了自动化实验与开放科学探索之间的差距。

Abstract: The history of science is punctuated by serendipitous discoveries, where
unexpected observations, rather than targeted hypotheses, opened new fields of
inquiry. While modern autonomous laboratories excel at accelerating hypothesis
testing, their optimization for efficiency risks overlooking these crucial,
unplanned findings. To address this gap, we introduce SciLink, an open-source,
multi-agent artificial intelligence framework designed to operationalize
serendipity in materials research by creating a direct, automated link between
experimental observation, novelty assessment, and theoretical simulations. The
framework employs a hybrid AI strategy where specialized machine learning
models perform quantitative analysis of experimental data, while large language
models handle higher-level reasoning. These agents autonomously convert raw
data from materials characterization techniques into falsifiable scientific
claims, which are then quantitatively scored for novelty against the published
literature. We demonstrate the framework's versatility across diverse research
scenarios, showcasing its application to atomic-resolution and hyperspectral
data, its capacity to integrate real-time human expert guidance, and its
ability to close the research loop by proposing targeted follow-up experiments.
By systematically analyzing all observations and contextualizing them, SciLink
provides a practical framework for AI-driven materials research that not only
enhances efficiency but also actively cultivates an environment ripe for
serendipitous discoveries, thereby bridging the gap between automated
experimentation and open-ended scientific exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型在自动驾驶中存在两个主要问题：开环模仿学习的性能受限和闭环训练对高保真模拟的依赖。

Method: 三阶段方法：1) 模仿学习预训练VLA策略；2) 通过逆强化学习构建轻量级奖励世界模型；3) 使用PPO优化奖励世界模型指导的强化学习。

Result: 在NAVSIM v2端到端驾驶基准中达到最优性能，并在CVPR2025 Autonomous Grand Challenge中获得亚军。

Conclusion: IRL-VLA框架为闭环自动驾驶中的VLA研究提供了高效解决方案，有望推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated potential in autonomous
driving. However, two critical challenges hinder their development: (1)
Existing VLA architectures are typically based on imitation learning in
open-loop setup which tends to capture the recorded behaviors in the dataset,
leading to suboptimal and constrained performance, (2) Close-loop training
relies heavily on high-fidelity sensor simulation, where domain gaps and
computational inefficiencies pose significant barriers. In this paper, we
introduce IRL-VLA, a novel close-loop Reinforcement Learning via
\textbf{I}nverse \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning reward world model
with a self-built VLA approach. Our framework proceeds in a three-stage
paradigm: In the first stage, we propose a VLA architecture and pretrain the
VLA policy via imitation learning. In the second stage, we construct a
lightweight reward world model via inverse reinforcement learning to enable
efficient close-loop reward computation. To further enhance planning
performance, finally, we design specialized reward world model guidence
reinforcement learning via PPO(Proximal Policy Optimization) to effectively
balance the safety incidents, comfortable driving, and traffic efficiency. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in NAVSIM v2 end-to-end driving
benchmark, 1st runner up in CVPR2025 Autonomous Grand Challenge. We hope that
our framework will accelerate VLA research in close-loop autonomous driving.

*Jayant Sravan Tamarapalli,Rynaa Grover,Nilay Pande,Sahiti Yerramilli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉场景理解上表现流畅，但在对象计数能力上存在严重不足。CountQA是一个新基准，用于测试和改善这一缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在对象计数能力上表现不佳，限制了其在实际应用中的可靠性。现有基准测试未能充分评估复杂场景下的计数能力。

Method: 引入CountQA基准，包含1,500多个问答对，涵盖高密度、杂乱和遮挡的真实世界图像。评估了15种主流MLLMs。

Result: 表现最佳的模型准确率仅为42.9%，且随着对象数量增加性能下降。

Conclusion: CountQA为改进MLLMs的计数能力提供了基准，推动开发更具数值和空间感知能力的模型。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable fluency in
understanding visual scenes, yet they exhibit a critical lack in a fundamental
cognitive skill: object counting. This blind spot severely limits their
reliability in real-world applications. To date, this capability has been
largely unevaluated in complex scenarios, as existing benchmarks either feature
sparse object densities or are confined to specific visual domains, failing to
test models under realistic conditions. Addressing this gap, we introduce
CountQA, a challenging new benchmark designed to probe this deficiency.
Comprising over 1,500 question-answer pairs, CountQA features real-world images
with high object density, clutter, and occlusion. We investigate this weakness
by evaluating 15 prominent MLLMs on the CountQA benchmark and reveal that the
top-performing model achieves a mere 42.9% accuracy, with performance declining
as object counts rise. By providing a dedicated benchmark to diagnose and
rectify this core weakness, CountQA paves the way for a new generation of MLLMs
that are not only descriptively fluent but also numerically grounded and
spatially aware. We will open-source the dataset and code upon paper acceptance
to foster further research.

### [321] [Formal Concept Analysis: a Structural Framework for Variability Extraction and Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06668)
*Jessie Galasso*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了形式概念分析（FCA）在变异性分析中的应用，总结了其关键属性及其在变异性信息解释中的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FCA在变异性分析中具有潜力，但其数学基础文献难以直接应用，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过选择和总结FCA框架中对变异性分析至关重要的属性，展示如何利用这些属性解释变异性信息。

Result: 明确了FCA在变异性分析中的关键属性及其应用方式。

Conclusion: FCA为变异性分析提供了有效工具，本文为其实际应用提供了指导。

Abstract: Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a mathematical framework for knowledge
representation and discovery. It performs a hierarchical clustering over a set
of objects described by attributes, resulting in conceptual structures in which
objects are organized depending on the attributes they share. These conceptual
structures naturally highlight commonalities and variabilities among similar
objects by categorizing them into groups which are then arranged by similarity,
making it particularly appropriate for variability extraction and analysis.
Despite the potential of FCA, determining which of its properties can be
leveraged for variability-related tasks (and how) is not always
straightforward, partly due to the mathematical orientation of its foundational
literature. This paper attempts to bridge part of this gap by gathering a
selection of properties of the framework which are essential to variability
analysis, and how they can be used to interpret diverse variability information
within the resulting conceptual structures.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于像素的轨迹校准辅助方法，用于零样本细胞轨迹地图匹配（CTMM），通过迁移地理空间知识和空间-时间感知模块提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTMM方法依赖区域特定数据和ID特征，难以适应未探索区域，需开发无需额外训练的零样本方法。

Method: 结合高斯混合模型的变分自编码器（VAE）提取场景自适应特征，设计空间-时间感知模块捕捉序列特征和位置不确定性，使用约束路径查找算法重构道路ID序列。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在零样本CTMM中性能优于现有方法16.8%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过迁移知识和优化路径查找，显著提升了零样本CTMM的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Cellular Trajectory Map-Matching (CTMM) aims to align cellular location
sequences to road networks, which is a necessary preprocessing in
location-based services on web platforms like Google Maps, including navigation
and route optimization. Current approaches mainly rely on ID-based features and
region-specific data to learn correlations between cell towers and roads,
limiting their adaptability to unexplored areas. To enable high-accuracy CTMM
without additional training in target regions, Zero-shot CTMM requires to
extract not only region-adaptive features, but also sequential and location
uncertainty to alleviate positioning errors in cellular data. In this paper, we
propose a pixel-based trajectory calibration assistant for zero-shot CTMM,
which takes advantage of transferable geospatial knowledge to calibrate
pixelated trajectory, and then guide the path-finding process at the road
network level. To enhance knowledge sharing across similar regions, a Gaussian
mixture model is incorporated into VAE, enabling the identification of
scenario-adaptive experts through soft clustering. To mitigate high positioning
errors, a spatial-temporal awareness module is designed to capture sequential
features and location uncertainty, thereby facilitating the inference of
approximate user positions. Finally, a constrained path-finding algorithm is
employed to reconstruct the road ID sequence, ensuring topological validity
within the road network. This process is guided by the calibrated trajectory
while optimizing for the shortest feasible path, thus minimizing unnecessary
detours. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing
methods in zero-shot CTMM by 16.8\%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过发现规则上下文并利用概率分布优化知识图谱补全的方法，显著减少了规则数量，同时保持或超越基线性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于规则的知识图谱补全方法虽然可解释性强，但需要大量规则才能达到竞争性能，这反而降低了可解释性。

Method: 从训练数据中发现规则上下文，并利用概率电路学习这些规则的概率分布，以快速达到完整规则集的性能。

Result: 方法减少了70-96%的规则数量，性能超越基线高达31倍，且保留91%的峰值性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在8个标准数据集上验证了有效性，且无需独立性假设，为基于规则的推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Rule-based methods for knowledge graph completion provide explainable results
but often require a significantly large number of rules to achieve competitive
performance. This can hinder explainability due to overwhelmingly large rule
sets. We discover rule contexts (meaningful subsets of rules that work
together) from training data and use learned probability distribution (i.e.
probabilistic circuits) over these rule contexts to more rapidly achieve
performance of the full rule set. Our approach achieves a 70-96% reduction in
number of rules used while outperforming baseline by up to 31$\times$ when
using equivalent minimal number of rules and preserves 91% of peak baseline
performance even when comparing our minimal rule sets against baseline's full
rule sets. We show that our framework is grounded in well-known semantics of
probabilistic logic, does not require independence assumptions, and that our
tractable inference procedure provides both approximate lower bounds and exact
probability of a given query. The efficacy of our method is validated by
empirical studies on 8 standard benchmark datasets where we show competitive
performance by using only a fraction of the rules required by AnyBURL's
standard inference method, the current state-of-the-art for rule-based
knowledge graph completion. This work may have further implications for general
probabilistic reasoning over learned sets of rules.

Motivation: 现有链式规则结构的假设限制了性能和可解释性，GLIDR旨在通过更灵活的规则结构解决这一问题。

Method: GLIDR使用可微分消息传递推理算法，支持包含分支和循环的规则，并通过限制自由变量数量参数化搜索空间。

Result: GLIDR在知识图谱补全任务中显著优于现有规则学习方法，甚至可与嵌入方法竞争，且对训练数据噪声具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GLIDR不仅提升了规则学习的性能，还能与深度神经网络结合进行端到端优化，适用于多模态数据。

Abstract: Differentiable inductive logic programming (ILP) techniques have proven
effective at finding approximate rule-based solutions to link prediction and
node classification problems on knowledge graphs; however, the common
assumption of chain-like rule structure can hamper the performance and
interpretability of existing approaches. We introduce GLIDR, a differentiable
rule learning method that models the inference of logic rules with more
expressive syntax than previous methods. GLIDR uses a differentiable message
passing inference algorithm that generalizes previous chain-like rule learning
methods to allow rules with features like branches and cycles. GLIDR has a
simple and expressive rule search space which is parameterized by a limit on
the maximum number of free variables that may be included in a rule. Explicit
logic rules can be extracted from the weights of a GLIDR model for use with
symbolic solvers. We demonstrate that GLIDR can significantly outperform
existing rule learning methods on knowledge graph completion tasks and even
compete with embedding methods despite the inherent disadvantage of being a
structure-only prediction method. We show that rules extracted from GLIDR
retain significant predictive performance, and that GLIDR is highly robust to
training data noise. Finally, we demonstrate that GLIDR can be chained with
deep neural networks and optimized end-to-end for rule learning on arbitrary
data modalities.

Result: 实验显示ParBalans在复杂MIP实例上表现优于Gurobi。

Conclusion: ParBalans通过并行化显著提升了MIP求解效率，尤其在困难问题上表现突出。

Abstract: Solving Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problems often requires substantial
computational resources due to their combinatorial nature. Parallelization has
emerged as a critical strategy to accelerate solution times and enhance
scalability to tackle large, complex instances. This paper investigates the
parallelization capabilities of Balans, a recently proposed multi-armed
bandits-based adaptive large neighborhood search for MIPs. While Balans's
modular architecture inherently supports parallel exploration of diverse
parameter configurations, this potential has not been thoroughly examined. To
address this gap, we introduce ParBalans, an extension that leverages both
solver-level and algorithmic-level parallelism to improve performance on
challenging MIP instances. Our experimental results demonstrate that ParBalans
exhibits competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art commercial
solver Gurobi, particularly on hard optimization benchmarks.

Abstract: With the growing demand for Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks in
sensitive applications, such as urban monitoring, emergency response, and
secure sensing, ensuring reliable connectivity and covert communication has
become increasingly vital. However, dynamic mobility and exposure risks pose
significant challenges. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a
self-organizing UAV network framework combining Graph Diffusion-based Policy
Optimization (GDPO) with a Stackelberg Game (SG)-based incentive mechanism. The
GDPO method uses generative AI to dynamically generate sparse but
well-connected topologies, enabling flexible adaptation to changing node
distributions and Ground User (GU) demands. Meanwhile, the Stackelberg Game
(SG)-based incentive mechanism guides self-interested UAVs to choose relay
behaviors and neighbor links that support cooperation and enhance covert
communication. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of model convergence, topology
generation quality, and enhancement of covert communication performance.

Motivation: 超低比特LLM模型在资源受限环境中具有潜力，但现有推理运行时的计算效率尚未充分探索。

Method: 设计并实现针对现代CPU优化的1-bit和2-bit微内核，集成到PyTorch-TPP框架中。

Result: 2-bit模型推理性能比当前SOTA运行时bitnet.cpp快2.2倍，比16-bit模型快7倍。

Conclusion: 优化后的运行为AI PC和边缘设备上的LLM推理提供了高效部署方案。

Abstract: The advent of ultra-low-bit LLM models (1/1.58/2-bit), which match the
perplexity and end-task performance of their full-precision counterparts using
the same model size, is ushering in a new era of LLM inference for
resource-constrained environments such as edge devices and AI PCs. While these
quantization advances promise models that are more cost-effective in terms of
latency, memory, throughput, and energy consumption, the computational
efficiency of state-of-the-art (SOTA) inference runtimes (e.g., bitnet.cpp)
used to deploy them remains underexplored. In this work, we take a bottom-up
approach: we first design and implement 1-bit and 2-bit microkernels optimized
for modern CPUs, achieving peak computational efficiency across a variety of
CPU platforms. We integrate these microkernels into a state-of-the-art LLM
inference framework, namely PyTorch-TPP, and present end-to-end inference
results with 2-bit models that outperform the current SOTA runtime bitnet.cpp
by up to 2.2x, and deliver up to 7x speedup compared to the 16-bit model
inference. Our optimized runtime advances the state of LLM inference on AI PCs
and edge devices, paving the way for efficient deployment of ultra-low-bit LLM
models.

Method: 结合自然语言边界提示和控制模式，采用模糊支架逻辑和适应规则，使LLMs能根据用户状态调整行为。

Result: 在模拟智能辅导环境中，框架在支架质量、适应性和教学对齐方面优于标准提示基线，并通过大规模基于量表的LLM评分进行评估。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于教育领域，还可用于其他交互密集型任务（如游戏内容生成），为不确定或动态环境中的可解释、目标对齐LLM行为提供了可重用方法。

Abstract: We introduce a modular prompting framework that supports safer and more
adaptive use of large language models (LLMs) across dynamic, user-centered
tasks. Grounded in human learning theory, particularly the Zone of Proximal
Development (ZPD), our method combines a natural language boundary prompt with
a control schema encoded with fuzzy scaffolding logic and adaptation rules.
This architecture enables LLMs to modulate behavior in response to user state
without requiring fine-tuning or external orchestration. In a simulated
intelligent tutoring setting, the framework improves scaffolding quality,
adaptivity, and instructional alignment across multiple models, outperforming
standard prompting baselines. Evaluation is conducted using rubric-based LLM
graders at scale. While initially developed for education, the framework has
shown promise in other interaction-heavy domains, such as procedural content
generation for games. Designed for safe deployment, it provides a reusable
methodology for structuring interpretable, goal-aligned LLM behavior in
uncertain or evolving contexts.

Abstract: Exploring volumetric data is crucial for interpreting scientific datasets.
However, selecting optimal viewpoints for effective navigation can be
challenging, particularly for users without extensive domain expertise or
familiarity with 3D navigation. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
that leverages natural language interaction to enhance volumetric data
exploration. Our approach encodes volumetric blocks to capture and
differentiate underlying structures. It further incorporates a CLIP Score
mechanism, which provides semantic information to the blocks to guide
navigation. The navigation is empowered by a reinforcement learning framework
that leverage these semantic cues to efficiently search for and identify
desired viewpoints that align with the user's intent. The selected viewpoints
are evaluated using CLIP Score to ensure that they best reflect the user

Abstract: The mainstream paradigm of remote sensing image interpretation has long been
dominated by vision-centered models, which rely on visual features for semantic
understanding. However, these models face inherent limitations in handling
multi-modal reasoning, semantic abstraction, and interactive decision-making.
While recent advances have introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) into remote
sensing workflows, existing studies primarily focus on downstream applications,
lacking a unified theoretical framework that explains the cognitive role of
language. This review advocates a paradigm shift from vision-centered to
language-centered remote sensing interpretation. Drawing inspiration from the
Global Workspace Theory (GWT) of human cognition, We propose a
language-centered framework for remote sensing interpretation that treats LLMs
as the cognitive central hub integrating perceptual, task, knowledge and action
spaces to enable unified understanding, reasoning, and decision-making. We
first explore the potential of LLMs as the central cognitive component in
remote sensing interpretation, and then summarize core technical challenges,
including unified multimodal representation, knowledge association, and
reasoning and decision-making. Furthermore, we construct a global
workspace-driven interpretation mechanism and review how language-centered
solutions address each challenge. Finally, we outline future research
directions from four perspectives: adaptive alignment of multimodal data, task
understanding under dynamic knowledge constraints, trustworthy reasoning, and
autonomous interaction. This work aims to provide a conceptual foundation for
the next generation of remote sensing interpretation systems and establish a
roadmap toward cognition-driven intelligent geospatial analysis.

### [331] [Multi-level Advantage Credit Assignment for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06836)
*Xutong Zhao,Yaqi Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多级优势信用分配方法（MACA），用于解决多智能体强化学习中的信用分配问题，通过显式反事实推理评估不同协作级别下智能体的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体强化学习（MARL）中的信用分配是一个关键挑战，尤其是在任务多样性和智能体协作方式不同的情况下，如何准确评估每个智能体对共享奖励的贡献。

Method: MACA通过多级优势公式进行显式反事实推理，结合注意力框架识别智能体间的相关性，并构建多级优势函数（个体、联合和相关动作）来指导策略学习。

Result: 在Starcraft v1和v2的复杂任务中，MACA表现出优越性能，验证了其在复杂信用分配场景中的有效性。

Conclusion: MACA通过多级优势信用分配，成功解决了多智能体协作中的信用分配问题，为复杂任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) aims to coordinate
multiple agents to achieve a common goal. A key challenge in MARL is credit
assignment, which involves assessing each agent's contribution to the shared
reward. Given the diversity of tasks, agents may perform different types of
coordination, with rewards attributed to diverse and often overlapping agent
subsets. In this work, we formalize the credit assignment level as the number
of agents cooperating to obtain a reward, and address scenarios with multiple
coexisting levels. We introduce a multi-level advantage formulation that
performs explicit counterfactual reasoning to infer credits across distinct
levels. Our method, Multi-level Advantage Credit Assignment (MACA), captures
agent contributions at multiple levels by integrating advantage functions that
reason about individual, joint, and correlated actions. Utilizing an
attention-based framework, MACA identifies correlated agent relationships and
constructs multi-level advantages to guide policy learning. Comprehensive
experiments on challenging Starcraft v1\&v2 tasks demonstrate MACA's superior
performance, underscoring its efficacy in complex credit assignment scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs的基准测试存在规模小、覆盖窄、知识结构不完整等问题，无法全面评估模型能力。

Method: 提出MDK12-Bench基准，基于真实K-12考试数据，包含141K实例和6,225个知识点，采用六层分类法。提出动态评估框架和知识参考增强生成（KP-RAG）方法。

Result: 发现当前MLLMs在多个方面存在局限性，为提升模型鲁棒性、可解释性和教育应用提供指导。

Conclusion: MDK12-Bench为MLLMs的全面评估提供了新工具，揭示了模型改进方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which integrate language and visual
cues for problem-solving, are crucial for advancing artificial general
intelligence (AGI). However, current benchmarks for measuring the intelligence
of MLLMs suffer from limited scale, narrow coverage, and unstructured
knowledge, offering only static and undifferentiated evaluations. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MDK12-Bench, a large-scale multidisciplinary benchmark
built from real-world K-12 exams spanning six disciplines with 141K instances
and 6,225 knowledge points organized in a six-layer taxonomy. Covering five
question formats with difficulty and year annotations, it enables comprehensive
evaluation to capture the extent to which MLLMs perform over four dimensions:
1) difficulty levels, 2) temporal (cross-year) shifts, 3) contextual shifts,
and 4) knowledge-driven reasoning. We propose a novel dynamic evaluation
framework that introduces unfamiliar visual, textual, and question form shifts
to challenge model generalization while improving benchmark objectivity and
longevity by mitigating data contamination. We further evaluate knowledge-point
reference-augmented generation (KP-RAG) to examine the role of knowledge in
problem-solving. Key findings reveal limitations in current MLLMs in multiple
aspects and provide guidance for enhancing model robustness, interpretability,
and AI-assisted education.

Abstract: Timely and accurate severe weather warnings are critical for disaster
mitigation. However, current forecasting systems remain heavily reliant on
manual expert interpretation, introducing subjectivity and significant
operational burdens. With the rapid development of AI technologies, the
end-to-end "AI weather station" is gradually emerging as a new trend in
predicting severe weather events. Three core challenges impede the development
of end-to-end AI severe weather system: (1) scarcity of severe weather event
samples; (2) imperfect alignment between high-dimensional meteorological data
and textual warnings; (3) existing multimodal language models are unable to
handle high-dimensional meteorological data and struggle to fully capture the
complex dependencies across temporal sequences, vertical pressure levels, and
spatial dimensions. To address these challenges, we introduce MP-Bench, the
first large-scale temporal multimodal dataset for severe weather events
prediction, comprising 421,363 pairs of raw multi-year meteorological data and
corresponding text caption, covering a wide range of severe weather scenarios
across China. On top of this dataset, we develop a meteorology multimodal large
model (MMLM) that directly ingests 4D meteorological inputs. In addition, it is
designed to accommodate the unique characteristics of 4D meteorological data
flow, incorporating three plug-and-play adaptive fusion modules that enable
dynamic feature extraction and integration across temporal sequences, vertical
pressure layers, and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments on MP-Bench
demonstrate that MMLM performs exceptionally well across multiple tasks,
highlighting its effectiveness in severe weather understanding and marking a
key step toward realizing automated, AI-driven weather forecasting systems. Our
source code and dataset will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于确定性下推自动机的pushdown奖励机（pdRM），扩展了奖励机（RM）的表达能力，能够识别和奖励确定性上下文无关语言表示的行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励机（RMs）在强化学习中提高了样本效率，但其表达能力有限，仅能处理正则语言。为了扩展其能力，本文提出pdRM以支持更复杂的行为。

Method: 提出了pdRM及其两种策略变体：一种可以访问整个堆栈，另一种仅能访问堆栈顶部的$k$个符号。并提出了检查两种策略最优性的方法。

Result: 理论分析表明pdRM具有更强的表达能力，实验结果显示pdRM能有效训练代理完成确定性上下文无关语言表示的任务。

Conclusion: pdRM扩展了RM的表达能力，适用于更复杂的任务，并通过理论和实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) are automata structures that encode (non-Markovian)
reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL). RMs can reward any behaviour
representable in regular languages and, when paired with RL algorithms that
exploit RM structure, have been shown to significantly improve sample
efficiency in many domains. In this work, we present pushdown reward machines
(pdRMs), an extension of reward machines based on deterministic pushdown
automata. pdRMs can recognize and reward temporally extended behaviours
representable in deterministic context-free languages, making them more
expressive than reward machines. We introduce two variants of pdRM-based
policies, one which has access to the entire stack of the pdRM, and one which
can only access the top $k$ symbols (for a given constant $k$) of the stack. We
propose a procedure to check when the two kinds of policies (for a given
environment, pdRM, and constant $k$) achieve the same optimal expected reward.
We then provide theoretical results establishing the expressive power of pdRMs,
and space complexity results about the proposed learning problems. Finally, we
provide experimental results showing how agents can be trained to perform tasks
representable in deterministic context-free languages using pdRMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的分布式引导局部搜索（DGLS）方法，解决了GDBA在分布式约束优化问题（DCOPs）中的性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GDBA虽然在局部搜索中提供了避免过早收敛的规则，但在一般值问题上的实际效果有限。

Method: DGLS引入了自适应违反条件、惩罚蒸发机制和同步方案，以优化约束惩罚和协调更新。

Result: DGLS在标准基准测试中显著优于现有方法，特别是在结构化问题上表现突出。

Conclusion: DGLS通过理论分析和实证验证，成为解决DCOPs的高效方法。

Abstract: Local search is an important class of incomplete algorithms for solving
Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) but it often converges to
poor local optima. While GDBA provides a comprehensive rule set to escape
premature convergence, its empirical benefits remain marginal on general-valued
problems. In this work, we systematically examine GDBA and identify three
factors that potentially lead to its inferior performance, i.e.,
over-aggressive constraint violation conditions, unbounded penalty
accumulation, and uncoordinated penalty updates. To address these issues, we
propose Distributed Guided Local Search (DGLS), a novel GLS framework for DCOPs
that incorporates an adaptive violation condition to selectively penalize
constraints with high cost, a penalty evaporation mechanism to control the
magnitude of penalization, and a synchronization scheme for coordinated penalty
updates. We theoretically show that the penalty values are bounded, and agents
play a potential game in our DGLS. Our extensive empirical results on various
standard benchmarks demonstrate the great superiority of DGLS over
state-of-the-art baselines. Particularly, compared to Damped Max-sum with high
damping factors (e.g., 0.7 or 0.9), our DGLS achieves competitive performance
on general-valued problems, and outperforms it by significant margins
(\textbf{3.77\%--66.3\%}) on structured problems in terms of anytime results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交互式定理证明器的手动形式化工作繁重且需要专业知识，自动形式化面临模型幻觉和语义鸿沟的挑战。

Method: 提出CRAMF框架，利用检索增强生成技术，从Mathlib4构建知识库，并结合上下文查询增强和混合检索策略。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，CRAMF显著提升了翻译准确性，最高达62.1%，平均提升29.9%。

Conclusion: CRAMF为自动形式化提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了LLM-based自动形式化的性能。

Abstract: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) require manual formalization, which is
labor-intensive and demands expert knowledge. While automated formalization
offers a potential solution, it faces two major challenges: model hallucination
(e.g., undefined predicates, symbol misuse, and version incompatibility) and
the semantic gap caused by ambiguous or missing premises in natural language
descriptions. To address these issues, we propose CRAMF, a Concept-driven
Retrieval-Augmented Mathematical Formalization framework. CRAMF enhances
LLM-based autoformalization by retrieving formal definitions of core
mathematical concepts, providing contextual grounding during code generation.
However, applying retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in this setting is
non-trivial due to the lack of structured knowledge bases, the polymorphic
nature of mathematical concepts, and the high precision required in formal
retrieval. We introduce a framework for automatically constructing a
concept-definition knowledge base from Mathlib4, the standard mathematical
library for the Lean 4 theorem prover, indexing over 26,000 formal definitions
and 1,000+ core mathematical concepts. To address conceptual polymorphism, we
propose contextual query augmentation with domain- and application-level
signals. In addition, we design a dual-channel hybrid retrieval strategy with
reranking to ensure accurate and relevant definition retrieval. Experiments on
miniF2F, ProofNet, and our newly proposed AdvancedMath benchmark show that
CRAMF can be seamlessly integrated into LLM-based autoformalizers, yielding
consistent improvements in translation accuracy, achieving up to 62.1% and an
average of 29.9% relative improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习在农业中应用广泛，但模型可解释性常被忽视，研究旨在利用Transformer的固有可解释性提升模型透明度。

Method: 使用自注意力机制，提出AR、GA和WMA方法，并与Shapley-based方法（SVS）对比评估。

Result: Transformer模型在子田和田间级别分别取得R2分数提升0.10和0.04，AR方法在时间归因上更可靠。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在多模态学习中表现优异，AR方法提供更稳健的解释，模态归因方法揭示了不同模式的差异。

Abstract: Multimodal learning enables various machine learning tasks to benefit from
diverse data sources, effectively mimicking the interplay of different factors
in real-world applications, particularly in agriculture. While the
heterogeneous nature of involved data modalities may necessitate the design of
complex architectures, the model interpretability is often overlooked. In this
study, we leverage the intrinsic explainability of Transformer-based models to
explain multimodal learning networks, focusing on the task of crop yield
prediction at the subfield level. The large datasets used cover various crops,
regions, and years, and include four different input modalities: multispectral
satellite and weather time series, terrain elevation maps and soil properties.
Based on the self-attention mechanism, we estimate feature attributions using
two methods, namely the Attention Rollout (AR) and Generic Attention (GA), and
evaluate their performance against Shapley-based model-agnostic estimations,
Shapley Value Sampling (SVS). Additionally, we propose the Weighted Modality
Activation (WMA) method to assess modality attributions and compare it with SVS
attributions. Our findings indicate that Transformer-based models outperform
other architectures, specifically convolutional and recurrent networks,
achieving R2 scores that are higher by 0.10 and 0.04 at the subfield and field
levels, respectively. AR is shown to provide more robust and reliable temporal
attributions, as confirmed through qualitative and quantitative evaluation,
compared to GA and SVS values. Information about crop phenology stages was
leveraged to interpret the explanation results in the light of established
agronomic knowledge. Furthermore, modality attributions revealed varying
patterns across the two methods compared.[...]

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM是否能替代人类参与者进行心理学研究，并提出反对观点。

Method: 通过概念论证和实证证据（如微调后的CENTAUR模型）展示LLM与人类反应的差异。

Result: LLM在心理学研究中不可靠，不同模型对相同问题的反应差异显著。

Conclusion: LLM不能模拟人类心理学，建议心理学研究者将其视为需验证的工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs),such as ChatGPT, are increasingly used in
research, ranging from simple writing assistance to complex data annotation
tasks. Recently, some research has suggested that LLMs may even be able to
simulate human psychology and can, hence, replace human participants in
psychological studies. We caution against this approach. We provide conceptual
arguments against the hypothesis that LLMs simulate human psychology. We then
present empiric evidence illustrating our arguments by demonstrating that
slight changes to wording that correspond to large changes in meaning lead to
notable discrepancies between LLMs' and human responses, even for the recent
CENTAUR model that was specifically fine-tuned on psychological responses.
Additionally, different LLMs show very different responses to novel items,
further illustrating their lack of reliability. We conclude that LLMs do not
simulate human psychology and recommend that psychological researchers should
treat LLMs as useful but fundamentally unreliable tools that need to be
validated against human responses for every new application.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has fundamentally shifted the
bottleneck in AI development from computational power to data availability-with
countless valuable datasets remaining hidden across specialized repositories,
research appendices, and domain platforms. As reasoning capabilities and deep
research methodologies continue to evolve, a critical question emerges: can AI
agents transcend conventional search to systematically discover any dataset
that meets specific user requirements, enabling truly autonomous demand-driven
data curation? We introduce DatasetResearch, the first comprehensive benchmark
evaluating AI agents' ability to discover and synthesize datasets from 208
real-world demands across knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive tasks.
Our tri-dimensional evaluation framework reveals a stark reality: even advanced
deep research systems achieve only 22% score on our challenging
DatasetResearch-pro subset, exposing the vast gap between current capabilities
and perfect dataset discovery. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental
dichotomy-search agents excel at knowledge tasks through retrieval breadth,
while synthesis agents dominate reasoning challenges via structured
generation-yet both catastrophically fail on "corner cases" outside existing
distributions. These findings establish the first rigorous baseline for dataset
discovery agents and illuminate the path toward AI systems capable of finding
any dataset in the digital universe. Our benchmark and comprehensive analysis
provide the foundation for the next generation of self-improving AI systems and

Conclusion: MASteer展示了高效、可扩展的可信性修复能力，具有强鲁棒性和实用价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face persistent and evolving trustworthiness
issues, motivating developers to seek automated and flexible repair methods
that enable convenient deployment across diverse scenarios. Existing repair
methods like supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) are costly and slow, while prompt engineering lacks robustness
and scalability. Representation engineering, which steers model behavior by
injecting targeted concept vectors during inference, offers a lightweight,
training-free alternative. However, current approaches depend on manually
crafted samples and fixed steering strategies, limiting automation and
adaptability. To overcome these challenges, we propose MASteer, the first
end-to-end framework for trustworthiness repair in LLMs based on representation
engineering. MASteer integrates two core components: AutoTester, a multi-agent
system that generates diverse, high-quality steer samples tailored to developer
needs; and AutoRepairer, which constructs adaptive steering strategies with
anchor vectors for automated, context-aware strategy selection during
inference. Experiments on standard and customized trustworthiness tasks show
MASteer consistently outperforms baselines, improving metrics by 15.36% on
LLaMA-3.1-8B-Chat and 4.21% on Qwen-3-8B-Chat, while maintaining general model
capabilities. MASteer demonstrates strong robustness, generalization, and
practical value for scalable, efficient trustworthiness repair.

Conclusion: DSperse通过局部化零知识证明，实现了高效、可扩展的分布式机器学习验证，适应多样化部署需求。

Abstract: DSperse is a modular framework for distributed machine learning inference
with strategic cryptographic verification. Operating within the emerging
paradigm of distributed zero-knowledge machine learning, DSperse avoids the
high cost and rigidity of full-model circuitization by enabling targeted
verification of strategically chosen subcomputations. These verifiable
segments, or "slices", may cover part or all of the inference pipeline, with
global consistency enforced through audit, replication, or economic incentives.
This architecture supports a pragmatic form of trust minimization, localizing
zero-knowledge proofs to the components where they provide the greatest value.
We evaluate DSperse using multiple proving systems and report empirical results
on memory usage, runtime, and circuit behavior under sliced and unsliced
configurations. By allowing proof boundaries to align flexibly with the model's
logical structure, DSperse supports scalable, targeted verification strategies
suited to diverse deployment needs.

Abstract: With recent and rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI),
understanding the foundation of purposeful behaviour in autonomous agents is
crucial for developing safe and efficient systems. While artificial neural
networks have dominated the path to AI, recent studies are exploring the
potential of biologically based systems, such as networks of living biological
neuronal networks. Along with promises of high power and data efficiency, these
systems may also inform more explainable and biologically plausible models. In
this work, we propose a framework rooted in active inference, a general theory
of behaviour, to model decision-making in embodied agents. Using
experiment-informed generative models, we simulate decision-making processes in
a simulated game-play environment, mirroring experimental setups that use
biological neurons. Our results demonstrate learning in these agents, providing
insights into the role of memory-based learning and predictive planning in
intelligent decision-making. This work contributes to the growing field of
explainable AI by offering a biologically grounded and scalable approach to
understanding purposeful behaviour in agents.

Motivation: 研究不同算法技术在隐式命中集（IHS）框架中的适用性，特别是在伪布尔优化背景下，以解决商业整数规划求解器可能存在的数值不稳定性和正确性问题。

Method: 通过伪布尔（PB）推理和随机局部搜索等替代技术实现命中集优化，并与商业整数规划求解器进行比较。

Result: 商业整数规划求解器效率最高但可能因数值不稳定性导致错误；基于PB推理的精确计算在效率上可与数值精确的整数规划求解器竞争，并能提供正确性证明。

Conclusion: PB推理作为命中集计算的基础，不仅效率与商业求解器相当，还能提供正确性证明，适用于任何可捕获为PB证明格式的IHS实例化。

Abstract: The implicit hitting set (IHS) approach offers a general framework for
solving computationally hard combinatorial optimization problems declaratively.
IHS iterates between a decision oracle used for extracting sources of
inconsistency and an optimizer for computing so-called hitting sets (HSs) over
the accumulated sources of inconsistency. While the decision oracle is
language-specific, the optimizers is usually instantiated through integer
programming.
  We explore alternative algorithmic techniques for hitting set optimization
based on different ways of employing pseudo-Boolean (PB) reasoning as well as
stochastic local search. We extensively evaluate the practical feasibility of
the alternatives in particular in the context of pseudo-Boolean (0-1 IP)
optimization as one of the most recent instantiations of IHS. Highlighting a
trade-off between efficiency and reliability, while a commercial IP solver
turns out to remain the most effective way to instantiate HS computations, it
can cause correctness issues due to numerical instability; in fact, we show
that exact HS computations instantiated via PB reasoning can be made
competitive with a numerically exact IP solver. Furthermore, the use of PB
reasoning as a basis for HS computations allows for obtaining certificates for
the correctness of IHS computations, generally applicable to any IHS
instantiation in which reasoning in the declarative language at hand can be
captured in the PB-based proof format we employ.

Conclusion: MultiMedEdit不仅揭示了当前方法的局限性，还为未来开发临床鲁棒KE技术提供了基础。

Abstract: Knowledge editing (KE) provides a scalable approach for updating factual
knowledge in large language models without full retraining. While previous
studies have demonstrated effectiveness in general domains and medical QA
tasks, little attention has been paid to KE in multimodal medical scenarios.
Unlike text-only settings, medical KE demands integrating updated knowledge
with visual reasoning to support safe and interpretable clinical decisions. To
address this gap, we propose MultiMedEdit, the first benchmark tailored to
evaluating KE in clinical multimodal tasks. Our framework spans both
understanding and reasoning task types, defines a three-dimensional metric
suite (reliability, generality, and locality), and supports cross-paradigm
comparisons across general and domain-specific models. We conduct extensive
experiments under single-editing and lifelong-editing settings. Results suggest
that current methods struggle with generalization and long-tail reasoning,
particularly in complex clinical workflows. We further present an efficiency
analysis (e.g., edit latency, memory footprint), revealing practical trade-offs
in real-world deployment across KE paradigms. Overall, MultiMedEdit not only
reveals the limitations of current approaches but also provides a solid
foundation for developing clinically robust knowledge editing techniques in the
future.

TL;DR: K-Dense Analyst是一个分层多代理系统，通过双循环架构实现自主生物信息学分析，性能优于现有语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代生物信息学分析的复杂性导致数据生成与科学洞察之间存在巨大差距，现有语言模型在处理实际分析流程时存在局限性。

Method: 采用分层多代理系统和双循环架构，将复杂目标分解为可执行、可验证的任务，并在安全计算环境中执行。

Result: 在BixBench基准测试中，K-Dense Analyst准确率达到29.2%，比最佳语言模型（GPT-5）高出6.3个百分点。

Conclusion: 自主科学推理需要专门构建的系统，K-Dense Analyst为生命科学领域的发现提供了重要进展。

Abstract: The complexity of modern bioinformatics analysis has created a critical gap
between data generation and developing scientific insights. While large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in scientific reasoning, they remain
fundamentally limited when dealing with real-world analytical workflows that
demand iterative computation, tool integration and rigorous validation. We
introduce K-Dense Analyst, a hierarchical multi-agent system that achieves
autonomous bioinformatics analysis through a dual-loop architecture. K-Dense
Analyst, part of the broader K-Dense platform, couples planning with validated
execution using specialized agents to decompose complex objectives into
executable, verifiable tasks within secure computational environments. On
BixBench, a comprehensive benchmark for open-ended biological analysis, K-Dense
Analyst achieves 29.2% accuracy, surpassing the best-performing language model
(GPT-5) by 6.3 percentage points, representing nearly 27% improvement over what
is widely considered the most powerful LLM available. Remarkably, K-Dense
Analyst achieves this performance using Gemini 2.5 Pro, which attains only
18.3% accuracy when used directly, demonstrating that our architectural
innovations unlock capabilities far beyond the underlying model's baseline
performance. Our insights demonstrate that autonomous scientific reasoning
requires more than enhanced language models, it demands purpose-built systems
that can bridge the gap between high-level scientific objectives and low-level
computational execution. These results represent a significant advance toward
fully autonomous computational biologists capable of accelerating discovery
across the life sciences.

Motivation: 随着AI系统在日常生活中的广泛应用，对更安全可靠的内容审核需求增加。尽管LLMs表现优异，但在涉及道德推理、隐式仇恨和偏见等问题上仍存在不足。

Method: 开发了一个基于SOTA模型的实验框架，评估LLMs在情感和冒犯性行为识别上的表现，并引入统一基准数据集和微调模型SafePhi。

Result: SafePhi在Macro F1得分上达到0.89，优于OpenAI Moderator（0.77）和Llama Guard（0.74），但LLMs在特定领域仍表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究强调了LLMs在内容审核中的局限性，建议引入更多异构数据和人类参与以提高模型的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: As AI systems become more integrated into daily life, the need for safer and
more reliable moderation has never been greater. Large Language Models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, surpassing earlier models in
complexity and performance. Their evaluation across diverse tasks has
consistently showcased their potential, enabling the development of adaptive
and personalized agents. However, despite these advancements, LLMs remain prone
to errors, particularly in areas requiring nuanced moral reasoning. They
struggle with detecting implicit hate, offensive language, and gender biases
due to the subjective and context-dependent nature of these issues. Moreover,
their reliance on training data can inadvertently reinforce societal biases,
leading to inconsistencies and ethical concerns in their outputs. To explore
the limitations of LLMs in this role, we developed an experimental framework
based on state-of-the-art (SOTA) models to assess human emotions and offensive
behaviors. The framework introduces a unified benchmark dataset encompassing 49
distinct categories spanning the wide spectrum of human emotions, offensive and
hateful text, and gender and racial biases. Furthermore, we introduced SafePhi,
a QLoRA fine-tuned version of Phi-4, adapting diverse ethical contexts and
outperforming benchmark moderators by achieving a Macro F1 score of 0.89, where
OpenAI Moderator and Llama Guard score 0.77 and 0.74, respectively. This
research also highlights the critical domains where LLM moderators consistently
underperformed, pressing the need to incorporate more heterogeneous and
representative data with human-in-the-loop, for better model robustness and
explainability.

Motivation: 现有机器学习模型多为静态，无法适应新数据（如干预后结果），需动态调整以提升预测效果。

Method: 结合LightGBM回归器和增量训练，支持实时输入更新数据并自动触发模型更新，采用SHAP增强可解释性。

Result: 实验显示RMSE降低10.7%，干预学生预测分数持续上调。

Conclusion: 该系统将静态预测器转化为自优化系统，推动教育分析向人本、数据驱动和响应式AI发展。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of student performance is essential for timely academic
intervention. However, most machine learning models in education are static and
cannot adapt when new data, such as post-intervention outcomes, become
available. To address this limitation, we propose a Feedback-Driven Decision
Support System (DSS) with a closed-loop architecture that enables continuous
model refinement. The system integrates a LightGBM-based regressor with
incremental retraining, allowing educators to input updated student results,
which automatically trigger model updates. This adaptive mechanism improves
prediction accuracy by learning from real-world academic progress. The platform
features a Flask-based web interface for real-time interaction and incorporates
SHAP for explainability, ensuring transparency. Experimental results show a
10.7\% reduction in RMSE after retraining, with consistent upward adjustments
in predicted scores for intervened students. By transforming static predictors
into self-improving systems, our approach advances educational analytics toward
human-centered, data-driven, and responsive AI. The framework is designed for
integration into LMS and institutional dashboards.

Method: 采用多代理管道，包括数据切片、方差检测、上下文构建和LLM生成。

Result: 框架在数据忠实度（83%）、显著变化覆盖率和决策关键见解相关性（4.4/5）上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂商业场景中显著提升了总结的准确性和相关性。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for summarizing structured enterprise data
across multiple dimensions using large language model (LLM)-based agents.
Traditional table-to-text models often lack the capacity to reason across
hierarchical structures and context-aware deltas, which are essential in
business reporting tasks. Our method introduces a multi-agent pipeline that
extracts, analyzes, and summarizes multi-dimensional data using agents for
slicing, variance detection, context construction, and LLM-based generation.
Our results show that the proposed framework outperforms traditional
approaches, achieving 83\% faithfulness to underlying data, superior coverage
of significant changes, and high relevance scores (4.4/5) for decision-critical
insights. The improvements are especially pronounced in categories involving
subtle trade-offs, such as increased revenue due to price changes amid
declining unit volumes, which competing methods either overlook or address with
limited specificity. We evaluate the framework on Kaggle datasets and
demonstrate significant improvements in faithfulness, relevance, and insight
quality over baseline table summarization approaches.

Result: EndoAgent在EndoAgentBench基准测试中表现优异，优于通用和医学多模态模型。

Conclusion: EndoAgent展示了强大的灵活性和推理能力，为内窥镜诊断提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Developing general artificial intelligence (AI) systems to support endoscopic
image diagnosis is an emerging research priority. Existing methods based on
large-scale pretraining often lack unified coordination across tasks and
struggle to handle the multi-step processes required in complex clinical
workflows. While AI agents have shown promise in flexible instruction parsing
and tool integration across domains, their potential in endoscopy remains
underexplored. To address this gap, we propose EndoAgent, the first
memory-guided agent for vision-to-decision endoscopic analysis that integrates
iterative reasoning with adaptive tool selection and collaboration. Built on a
dual-memory design, it enables sophisticated decision-making by ensuring
logical coherence through short-term action tracking and progressively
enhancing reasoning acuity through long-term experiential learning. To support
diverse clinical tasks, EndoAgent integrates a suite of expert-designed tools
within a unified reasoning loop. We further introduce EndoAgentBench, a
benchmark of 5,709 visual question-answer pairs that assess visual
understanding and language generation capabilities in realistic scenarios.
Extensive experiments show that EndoAgent consistently outperforms both general
and medical multimodal models, exhibiting its strong flexibility and reasoning
capabilities.

Result: 在知名大学案例研究中验证了框架，构建了XUBench，一个大规模、全面的封闭领域基准测试。

Conclusion: Comp-Comp框架不仅适用于学术领域，还可扩展到其他领域，为基准测试构建提供了新思路。

Abstract: Numerous benchmarks have been built to evaluate the domain-specific abilities
of large language models (LLMs), highlighting the need for effective and
efficient benchmark construction. Existing domain-specific benchmarks primarily
focus on the scaling law, relying on massive corpora for supervised fine-tuning
or generating extensive question sets for broad coverage. However, the impact
of corpus and question-answer (QA) set design on the precision and recall of
domain-specific LLMs remains unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap and
demonstrate that the scaling law is not always the optimal principle for
benchmark construction in specific domains. Instead, we propose Comp-Comp, an
iterative benchmarking framework based on a comprehensiveness-compactness
principle. Here, comprehensiveness ensures semantic recall of the domain, while
compactness enhances precision, guiding both corpus and QA set construction. To
validate our framework, we conducted a case study in a well-renowned
university, resulting in the creation of XUBench, a large-scale and
comprehensive closed-domain benchmark. Although we use the academic domain as
the case in this work, our Comp-Comp framework is designed to be extensible
beyond academia, providing valuable insights for benchmark construction across
various domains.

Motivation: 当前LLM在渗透测试中存在错误处理差、推理效率低和无法自主完成复杂任务等问题，Pentest-R1旨在解决这些限制。

Method: 采用两阶段强化学习：离线RL利用500多个真实世界多步骤演练数据，在线RL在交互式CTF环境中微调LLM。

Result: 在AutoPenBench上成功率为24.2%，仅次于Gemini 2.5 Flash；在Cybench上达到15.0%成功率，创开源LLM新纪录。

Conclusion: 两阶段训练的协同作用对Pentest-R1的成功至关重要，其性能接近顶级专有模型。

Abstract: Automating penetration testing is crucial for enhancing cybersecurity, yet
current Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant limitations in this
domain, including poor error handling, inefficient reasoning, and an inability
to perform complex end-to-end tasks autonomously. To address these challenges,
we introduce Pentest-R1, a novel framework designed to optimize LLM reasoning
capabilities for this task through a two-stage reinforcement learning pipeline.
We first construct a dataset of over 500 real-world, multi-step walkthroughs,
which Pentest-R1 leverages for offline reinforcement learning (RL) to instill
foundational attack logic. Subsequently, the LLM is fine-tuned via online RL in
an interactive Capture The Flag (CTF) environment, where it learns directly
from environmental feedback to develop robust error self-correction and
adaptive strategies. Our extensive experiments on the Cybench and AutoPenBench
benchmarks demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. On AutoPenBench,
Pentest-R1 achieves a 24.2\% success rate, surpassing most state-of-the-art
models and ranking second only to Gemini 2.5 Flash. On Cybench, it attains a
15.0\% success rate in unguided tasks, establishing a new state-of-the-art for
open-source LLMs and matching the performance of top proprietary models.
Ablation studies confirm that the synergy of both training stages is critical
to its success.

Motivation: 现有方法过度优化时间IoU指标，牺牲了语义动作理解，影响TVG的鲁棒性。

Method: 引入三个反转任务（动词补全、动作识别、视频描述），结合强化学习框架平衡定位与语义优化。

Result: 实验显示方法优于现有技术，在Charades-STA上R1@0.7提升7.1%。

Conclusion: 通过反转任务强化语义理解，显著提高定位精度上限。

Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG) seeks to localize video segments matching a
given textual query. Current methods, while optimizing for high temporal
Intersection-over-Union (IoU), often overfit to this metric, compromising
semantic action understanding in the video and query, a critical factor for
robust TVG. To address this, we introduce Inversion Tasks for TVG (Invert4TVG),
a novel framework that enhances both localization accuracy and action
understanding without additional data. Our approach leverages three inversion
tasks derived from existing TVG annotations: (1) Verb Completion, predicting
masked action verbs in queries from video segments; (2) Action Recognition,
identifying query-described actions; and (3) Video Description, generating
descriptions of video segments that explicitly embed query-relevant actions.
These tasks, integrated with TVG via a reinforcement learning framework with
well-designed reward functions, ensure balanced optimization of localization
and semantics. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving a 7.1\% improvement in R1@0.7 on Charades-STA for a 3B
model compared to Time-R1. By inverting TVG to derive query-related actions
from segments, our approach strengthens semantic understanding, significantly
raising the ceiling of localization accuracy.

Abstract: Given recent breakthroughs in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) and
Large Language Models (LLMs), more and more professional services are being
augmented through Artificial Intelligence (AI), which once seemed impossible to
automate. This paper presents a modular model for leveraging GAI in developing
strategic plans for large scale government organizations and evaluates leading
machine learning techniques in their application towards one of the identified
modules. Specifically, the performance of BERTopic and Non-negative Matrix
Factorization (NMF) are evaluated in their ability to use topic modeling to
generate themes representative of Vision Elements within a strategic plan. To
accomplish this, BERTopic and NMF models are trained using a large volume of
reports from the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The generated topics
from each model are then scored for similarity against the Vision Elements of a
published strategic plan and the results are compared. Our results show that
these techniques are capable of generating themes similar to 100% of the
elements being evaluated against. Further, we conclude that BERTopic performs
best in this application with more than half of its correlated topics achieving
a "medium" or "strong" correlation. A capability of GAI-enabled strategic plan
development impacts a multi-billion dollar industry and assists the federal
government in overcoming regulatory requirements which are crucial to the
public good. Further work will focus on the operationalization of the concept
proven in this study as well as viability of the remaining modules in the
proposed model for GAI-generated strategic plans.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have sparked growing interest in AI
agents capable of solving complex, real-world tasks. However, most existing
agent systems rely on manually crafted configurations that remain static after
deployment, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic and evolving
environments. To this end, recent research has explored agent evolution
techniques that aim to automatically enhance agent systems based on interaction
data and environmental feedback. This emerging direction lays the foundation
for self-evolving AI agents, which bridge the static capabilities of foundation
models with the continuous adaptability required by lifelong agentic systems.
In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques for
self-evolving agentic systems. Specifically, we first introduce a unified
conceptual framework that abstracts the feedback loop underlying the design of
self-evolving agentic systems. The framework highlights four key components:
System Inputs, Agent System, Environment, and Optimisers, serving as a
foundation for understanding and comparing different strategies. Based on this
framework, we systematically review a wide range of self-evolving techniques
that target different components of the agent system. We also investigate
domain-specific evolution strategies developed for specialised fields such as
biomedicine, programming, and finance, where optimisation objectives are
tightly coupled with domain constraints. In addition, we provide a dedicated
discussion on the evaluation, safety, and ethical considerations for
self-evolving agentic systems, which are critical to ensuring their
effectiveness and reliability. This survey aims to provide researchers and
practitioners with a systematic understanding of self-evolving AI agents,
laying the foundation for the development of more adaptive, autonomous, and
lifelong agentic systems.

extend the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by integrating them

Result: 该方法成功解决了CP-Bench基准集中的所有101个问题。

Conclusion: 约束建模任务需要结合通用编码工具和提示编码的领域知识，而非专用代理架构或预定义流程。

Abstract: Translating natural language problem descriptions into formal constraint
models remains a fundamental challenge in constraint programming, requiring
deep expertise in both the problem domain and modeling frameworks. Previous
approaches to automating this translation have employed fixed workflows with
predetermined modeling steps, failing on a significant number of benchmark
problems. We present a new approach using a pure agentic strategy without any
fixed pipeline. We developed a general-purpose Python coding agent based on the
ReAct (Reason and Act) principle, utilizing a persistent IPython kernel for
stateful code execution and iterative development. Rather than embedding
constraint programming logic into the agent architecture, domain-specific
expertise is injected solely through a carefully crafted project prompt. The
agent combines this prompt-encoded knowledge with access to file operations and
code execution tools, enabling it to test hypotheses, debug failures, and
verify solutions dynamically. Implemented in just a few hundred lines of code,
this architecture successfully solves all 101 problems of the CP-Bench
constraint programming benchmark set. The results suggest that constraint
modeling tasks require the combination of general coding tools and domain
expertise encoded in prompts, rather than specialized agent architectures or
predefined workflows.

Conclusion: 该工具降低了评估LLM战略推理的门槛，揭示了这些能力如何自然地从广泛使用的LLM中涌现。

Abstract: We present the first evaluation harness that enables any out-of-the-box,
local, Large Language Models (LLMs) to play full-press Diplomacy without
fine-tuning or specialized training. Previous work required frontier LLMs, or
fine-tuning, due to the high complexity and information density of Diplomacy's
game state. Combined with the high variance of matches, these factors made
Diplomacy prohibitive for study. In this work, we used data-driven iteration to
optimize a textual game state representation such that a 24B model can reliably
complete matches without any fine tuning. We develop tooling to facilitate
hypothesis testing and statistical analysis, and we present case studies on
persuasion, aggressive playstyles, and performance across a range of models. We
conduct a variety of experiments across many popular LLMs, finding the larger
models perform the best, but the smaller models still play adequately. We also
introduce Critical State Analysis: an experimental protocol for rapidly
iterating and analyzing key moments in a game at depth. Our harness
democratizes the evaluation of strategic reasoning in LLMs by eliminating the
need for fine-tuning, and it provides insights into how these capabilities
emerge naturally from widely used LLMs. Our code is available in the supplement

### [359] [MCPToolBench++: A Large Scale AI Agent Model Context Protocol MCP Tool Use Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07575)
*Shiqing Fan,Xichen Ding,Liang Zhang,Linjian Mo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了MCPToolBench++，一个用于评估LLMs和AI代理使用MCP工具能力的大规模多领域基准测试，解决了现有评估方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏全面的数据集或基准来评估MCP工具的使用能力，且MCP工具的多样性和上下文窗口限制增加了评估难度。

Method: 构建了MCPToolBench++基准，基于来自MCP市场和GitHub社区的4k多个MCP服务器，覆盖40多个类别，包含单步和多步工具调用。

Result: 在基准测试上评估了具有代理能力的SOTA LLMs，并报告了结果。

Conclusion: MCPToolBench++为评估LLMs在MCP工具调用上的性能提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: LLMs' capabilities are enhanced by using function calls to integrate various
data sources or API results into the context window. Typical tools include
search, web crawlers, maps, financial data, file systems, and browser usage,
etc. Integrating these data sources or functions requires a standardized
method. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way to supply
context to LLMs. However, the evaluation of LLMs and AI Agents' MCP tool use
abilities suffer from several issues. First, there's a lack of comprehensive
datasets or benchmarks to evaluate various MCP tools. Second, the diverse
formats of response from MCP tool call execution further increase the
difficulty of evaluation. Additionally, unlike existing tool-use benchmarks
with high success rates in functions like programming and math functions, the
success rate of real-world MCP tool is not guaranteed and varies across
different MCP servers. Furthermore, the LLMs' context window also limits the
number of available tools that can be called in a single run, because the
textual descriptions of tool and the parameters have long token length for an
LLM to process all at once. To help address the challenges of evaluating LLMs'
performance on calling MCP tools, we propose MCPToolBench++, a large-scale,
multi-domain AI Agent tool use benchmark. As of July 2025, this benchmark is
build upon marketplace of over 4k MCP servers from more than 40 categories,
collected from the MCP marketplaces and GitHub communities. The datasets
consist of both single-step and multi-step tool calls across different
categories. We evaluated SOTA LLMs with agentic abilities on this benchmark and
reported the results.

Result: 相比传统强化学习方法，隐私和传输质量分别提升77.8%和14.3%。

Conclusion: 提出的算法有效提升了语义通信的隐私保护和传输质量，适用于无干扰器通信的场景。

Abstract: In this paper, a novel covert semantic communication framework is
investigated. Within this framework, a server extracts and transmits the
semantic information, i.e., the meaning of image data, to a user over several
time slots. An attacker seeks to detect and eavesdrop the semantic transmission
to acquire details of the original image. To avoid data meaning being
eavesdropped by an attacker, a friendly jammer is deployed to transmit jamming
signals to interfere the attacker so as to hide the transmitted semantic
information. Meanwhile, the server will strategically select time slots for
semantic information transmission. Due to limited energy, the jammer will not
communicate with the server and hence the server does not know the transmit
power of the jammer. Therefore, the server must jointly optimize the semantic
information transmitted at each time slot and the corresponding transmit power
to maximize the privacy and the semantic information transmission quality of
the user. To solve this problem, we propose a prioritised sampling assisted
twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to jointly determine
the transmitted semantic information and the transmit power per time slot
without the communications between the server and the jammer. Compared to
standard reinforcement learning methods, the propose method uses an additional
Q network to estimate Q values such that the agent can select the action with a
lower Q value from the two Q networks thus avoiding local optimal action
selection and estimation bias of Q values. Simulation results show that the
proposed algorithm can improve the privacy and the semantic information
transmission quality by up to 77.8% and 14.3% compared to the traditional
reinforcement learning methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HGMF框架通过分层高斯混合模型优化LLM工具选择，提高准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在大规模工具库中选择工具的挑战，如上下文限制和无关选项干扰。

Method: 使用HGMF框架，分两阶段聚类和过滤工具：先对服务器聚类，再对关联工具聚类。

Result: 实验显示HGMF显著提升工具选择准确性并降低延迟。

Conclusion: HGMF可扩展且高效，适用于大规模工具库。

Abstract: Invoking external tools enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform
complex, real-world tasks, yet selecting the correct tool from large,
hierarchically-structured libraries remains a significant challenge. The
limited context windows of LLMs and noise from irrelevant options often lead to
low selection accuracy and high computational costs. To address this, we
propose the Hierarchical Gaussian Mixture Framework (HGMF), a probabilistic
pruning method for scalable tool invocation. HGMF first maps the user query and
all tool descriptions into a unified semantic space. The framework then
operates in two stages: it clusters servers using a Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) and filters them based on the query's likelihood. Subsequently, it
applies the same GMM-based clustering and filtering to the tools associated
with the selected servers. This hierarchical process produces a compact,
high-relevance candidate set, simplifying the final selection task for the LLM.
Experiments on a public dataset show that HGMF significantly improves tool
selection accuracy while reducing inference latency, confirming the framework's
scalability and effectiveness for large-scale tool libraries.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出ThinkTuning方法，通过教师模型指导学生模型，提升其推理能力，实验显示显著优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法仅能激发模型已有行为，无法培养新的推理能力，因此需探索如何训练不具备此类行为的模型。

Method: 采用GRPO框架，通过教师模型提供反馈，逐步指导学生模型改进推理能力。

Result: 在多个基准测试中平均提升3.85%，特定任务如MATH-500、AIME和GPQA-Diamond分别提升2.08%、2.23%和3.99%。

Conclusion: ThinkTuning通过教师反馈有效提升学生模型的推理能力，为模型训练提供新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time scaling have led to the emergence of thinking
LLMs that exhibit self-reflective behaviors and multi-step reasoning. While RL
drives this self-improvement paradigm, a recent study (Gandhi et al., 2025)
shows that RL alone does not truly instill these new reasoning abilities - it
merely draws out behaviors already present in the base models. This raises a
question: How can we train the models that don't exhibit such thinking behavior
to develop it in the first place? To this end, we propose ThinkTuning, a
GRPO-based interactive training approach where we augment the rollouts of a
student model with the guidance from a teacher model. A simple idea from
classroom practice inspires our method: a teacher poses a problem, lets the
student try an answer, then gives corrective feedback -- enough to point the
mind in the right direction and then show the solution. Each piece of feedback
reshapes the student's thoughts, leading them to arrive at the correct
solution. Similarly, we find that this type of implicit supervision through
feedback from a teacher model of the same size improves the reasoning
capabilities of the student model. In particular, on average, our method shows
a 3.85% improvement over zero-shot baselines across benchmarks, and on
MATH-500, AIME and GPQA-Diamond it shows 2.08%, 2.23% and 3.99% improvements
over the vanilla-GRPO baseline. Source code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出利用多模态AI技术改进家禽福利监测，通过特征级融合策略实现高效、可扩展的解决方案，并引入新评估工具和部署框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统家禽福利监测依赖主观观察和单一传感器数据，无法全面反映现代农场中蛋鸡的多维福利需求。

Method: 采用多模态AI整合视觉、声音、环境和生理数据，提出特征级融合策略，并引入域转移评分（DTS）和数据可靠性指数（DRI）作为评估工具。

Result: 特征级融合策略在鲁棒性和性能上表现最佳，新工具和框架解决了传感器脆弱性、部署成本等障碍。

Conclusion: 多模态AI为家禽福利监测提供了从被动单模态到主动精准系统的转型基础，兼顾生产效率和科学伦理。

Abstract: The future of poultry production depends on a paradigm shift replacing
subjective, labor-intensive welfare checks with data-driven, intelligent
monitoring ecosystems. Traditional welfare assessments-limited by human
observation and single-sensor data-cannot fully capture the complex,
multidimensional nature of laying hen welfare in modern farms. Multimodal
Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a breakthrough, integrating visual,
acoustic, environmental, and physiological data streams to reveal deeper
insights into avian welfare dynamics. This investigation highlights multimodal
As transformative potential, showing that intermediate (feature-level) fusion
strategies achieve the best balance between robustness and performance under
real-world poultry conditions, and offer greater scalability than early or late
fusion approaches. Key adoption barriers include sensor fragility in harsh farm
environments, high deployment costs, inconsistent behavioral definitions, and
limited cross-farm generalizability. To address these, we introduce two novel
evaluation tools - the Domain Transfer Score (DTS) to measure model
adaptability across diverse farm settings, and the Data Reliability Index (DRI)
to assess sensor data quality under operational constraints. We also propose a
modular, context-aware deployment framework designed for laying hen
environments, enabling scalable and practical integration of multimodal
sensing. This work lays the foundation for a transition from reactive, unimodal
monitoring to proactive, precision-driven welfare systems that unite
productivity with ethical, science based animal care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLN方法在复杂空间和时间推理场景中泛化能力不足，需要更结构化的解决方案。

Method: 提出SkillNav框架，将导航任务分解为原子技能，每个技能由专门代理处理，并使用VLM路由器动态选择代理。

Result: 在R2R和GSA-R2R基准测试中达到新SOTA，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SkillNav通过模块化和技能分解显著提升了VLN任务的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) poses significant challenges in enabling
agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex 3D
environments. While recent progress has been driven by large-scale pre-training
and data augmentation, current methods still struggle to generalize to unseen
scenarios, particularly when complex spatial and temporal reasoning is
required. In this work, we propose SkillNav, a modular framework that
introduces structured, skill-based reasoning into Transformer-based VLN agents.
Our method decomposes navigation into a set of interpretable atomic skills
(e.g., Vertical Movement, Area and Region Identification, Stop and Pause), each
handled by a specialized agent. We then introduce a novel zero-shot
Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based router, which dynamically selects the most
suitable agent at each time step by aligning sub-goals with visual observations
and historical actions. SkillNav achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on
the R2R benchmark and demonstrates strong generalization to the GSA-R2R
benchmark that includes novel instruction styles and unseen environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将时空转换分开建模，导致关键节点表示不一致，引入冗余信息，降低模型性能和可解释性。

Method: 提出DiMuST模型，采用解耦变分多图自编码器（DAE），分离共享和私有分布，通过PoE机制融合共享特征，对比约束去噪私有特征。

Result: 在两个数据集上，DiMuST在多项指标上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiMuST有效捕捉POI的时空转换表示，同时保持其时空关系的内在相关性。

Abstract: Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a research hotspot in business
intelligence, where users' spatial-temporal transitions and social
relationships play key roles. However, most existing works model spatial and
temporal transitions separately, leading to misaligned representations of the
same spatial-temporal key nodes. This misalignment introduces redundant
information during fusion, increasing model uncertainty and reducing
interpretability. To address this issue, we propose DiMuST, a socially enhanced
POI recommendation model based on disentangled representation learning over
multiplex spatial-temporal transition graphs. The model employs a novel
Disentangled variational multiplex graph Auto-Encoder (DAE), which first
disentangles shared and private distributions using a multiplex
spatial-temporal graph strategy. It then fuses the shared features via a
Product of Experts (PoE) mechanism and denoises the private features through
contrastive constraints. The model effectively captures the spatial-temporal
transition representations of POIs while preserving the intrinsic correlation
of their spatial-temporal relationships. Experiments on two challenging
datasets demonstrate that our DiMuST significantly outperforms existing methods
across multiple metrics.

Motivation: 解决交互式环境中大语言模型处理多源信息时的上下文隐私问题。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，将隐私推理分解为提取和分类等子任务，并通过信息流拓扑分析隐私错误的传播。

Result: 实验表明，最佳多智能体配置在ConfAIde和PrivacyLens基准上分别减少18%和19%的隐私泄露。

Conclusion: 多智能体系统的信息流设计在上下文隐私保护中具有潜力。

Abstract: Addressing contextual privacy concerns remains challenging in interactive
settings where large language models (LLMs) process information from multiple
sources (e.g., summarizing meetings with private and public information). We
introduce a multi-agent framework that decomposes privacy reasoning into
specialized subtasks (extraction, classification), reducing the information
load on any single agent while enabling iterative validation and more reliable
adherence to contextual privacy norms. To understand how privacy errors emerge
and propagate, we conduct a systematic ablation over information-flow
topologies, revealing when and why upstream detection mistakes cascade into
downstream leakage. Experiments on the ConfAIde and PrivacyLens benchmark with
several open-source and closed-sourced LLMs demonstrate that our best
multi-agent configuration substantially reduces private information leakage
(\textbf{18\%} on ConfAIde and \textbf{19\%} on PrivacyLens with GPT-4o) while
preserving the fidelity of public content, outperforming single-agent
baselines. These results highlight the promise of principled information-flow
design in multi-agent systems for contextual privacy with LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI方法在难民整合中过于关注就业等狭隘目标，忽视了文化、情感和伦理等长期成功的关键维度。

Method: EMPATHIA基于Kegan的建构发展理论，分为SEED、RISE和THRIVE三个模块，采用多智能体透明决策。

Result: 在UN Kakuma数据集上验证，实现87.4%的收敛率，并在五个东道国提供可解释的评估。

Conclusion: EMPATHIA通过平衡多元价值体系，为AI驱动的分配任务提供可推广的框架，同时增强而非取代人类专业知识。

Abstract: Current AI approaches to refugee integration optimize narrow objectives such
as employment and fail to capture the cultural, emotional, and ethical
dimensions critical for long-term success. We introduce EMPATHIA (Enriched
Multimodal Pathways for Agentic Thinking in Humanitarian Immigrant Assistance),
a multi-agent framework addressing the central Creative AI question: how do we
preserve human dignity when machines participate in life-altering decisions?
Grounded in Kegan's Constructive Developmental Theory, EMPATHIA decomposes
integration into three modules: SEED (Socio-cultural Entry and Embedding
Decision) for initial placement, RISE (Rapid Integration and Self-sufficiency
Engine) for early independence, and THRIVE (Transcultural Harmony and
Resilience through Integrated Values and Engagement) for sustained outcomes.
SEED employs a selector-validator architecture with three specialized agents -
emotional, cultural, and ethical - that deliberate transparently to produce
interpretable recommendations. Experiments on the UN Kakuma dataset (15,026
individuals, 7,960 eligible adults 15+ per ILO/UNHCR standards) and
implementation on 6,359 working-age refugees (15+) with 150+ socioeconomic
variables achieved 87.4% validation convergence and explainable assessments
across five host countries. EMPATHIA's weighted integration of cultural,
emotional, and ethical factors balances competing value systems while
supporting practitioner-AI collaboration. By augmenting rather than replacing
human expertise, EMPATHIA provides a generalizable framework for AI-driven
allocation tasks where multiple values must be reconciled.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI系统与人类价值观对齐的难题，尤其是在涉及不可比较的伦理价值时。

Method: 扩展Anything2vec方法，将代理的决策策略映射为多元向量表示，用于比较和评估。

Result: 提出了Ethics2Vec方法，并在二元决策和自动驾驶控制场景中验证其可行性。

Conclusion: Ethics2Vec为评估AI系统与人类价值观对齐提供了一种可行的方法。

Abstract: Though intelligent agents are supposed to improve human experience (or make
it more efficient), it is hard from a human perspective to grasp the ethical
values which are explicitly or implicitly embedded in an agent behaviour. This
is the well-known problem of alignment, which refers to the challenge of
designing AI systems that align with human values, goals and preferences. This
problem is particularly challenging since most human ethical considerations
refer to \emph{incommensurable} (i.e. non-measurable and/or incomparable)
values and criteria. Consider, for instance, a medical agent prescribing a
treatment to a cancerous patient. How could it take into account (and/or weigh)
incommensurable aspects like the value of a human life and the cost of the
treatment? Now, the alignment between human and artificial values is possible
only if we define a common space where a metric can be defined and used. This
paper proposes to extend to ethics the conventional Anything2vec approach,
which has been successful in plenty of similar and hard-to-quantify domains
(ranging from natural language processing to recommendation systems and graph
analysis). This paper proposes a way to map an automatic agent decision-making
(or control law) strategy to a multivariate vector representation, which can be
used to compare and assess the alignment with human values. The Ethics2Vec
method is first introduced in the case of an automatic agent performing binary
decision-making. Then, a vectorisation of an automatic control law (like in the
case of a self-driving car) is discussed to show how the approach can be
extended to automatic control settings.

Motivation: Transformer在自动规划领域的应用受限，主要由于其对问题对称性的处理不足，导致难以从简单问题推广到复杂问题。

Method: 提出了一种新的对比学习目标，结合架构改进，使Transformer能够感知对称性，适用于规划生成或启发式预测。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个规划领域中有效且高效地解决了PlanGPT的局限性。

Conclusion: 通过对称性感知训练，Transformer在自动规划任务中的表现得到显著提升。

Abstract: While transformers excel in many settings, their application in the field of
automated planning is limited. Prior work like PlanGPT, a state-of-the-art
decoder-only transformer, struggles with extrapolation from easy to hard
planning problems. This in turn stems from problem symmetries: planning tasks
can be represented with arbitrary variable names that carry no meaning beyond
being identifiers. This causes a combinatorial explosion of equivalent
representations that pure transformers cannot efficiently learn from. We
propose a novel contrastive learning objective to make transformers
symmetry-aware and thereby compensate for their lack of inductive bias.
Combining this with architectural improvements, we show that transformers can
be efficiently trained for either plan-generation or heuristic-prediction. Our
results across multiple planning domains demonstrate that our symmetry-aware
training effectively and efficiently addresses the limitations of PlanGPT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RMDPs中可能存在多个最优鲁棒策略，这些策略在最坏情况下等效，但在非对抗性概率下表现不同。因此，需要一种更精细的策略选择标准。

Method: 提出ORBE策略，结合博弈论中的优势与最佳努力概念，要求策略不仅在最坏情况下最优，还能在非对抗性概率下最大化期望回报。

Result: 证明了ORBE策略的存在性，描述了其结构，并提出了计算算法，实验验证了可行性。

Conclusion: ORBE策略为最优鲁棒策略提供了原则性的选择标准，计算开销小，实用性强。

Abstract: We study the common generalization of Markov decision processes (MDPs) with
sets of transition probabilities, known as robust MDPs (RMDPs). A standard goal
in RMDPs is to compute a policy that maximizes the expected return under an
adversarial choice of the transition probabilities. If the uncertainty in the
probabilities is independent between the states, known as s-rectangularity,
such optimal robust policies can be computed efficiently using robust value
iteration. However, there might still be multiple optimal robust policies,
which, while equivalent with respect to the worst-case, reflect different
expected returns under non-adversarial choices of the transition probabilities.
Hence, we propose a refined policy selection criterion for RMDPs, drawing
inspiration from the notions of dominance and best-effort in game theory.
Instead of seeking a policy that only maximizes the worst-case expected return,
we additionally require the policy to achieve a maximal expected return under
different (i.e., not fully adversarial) transition probabilities. We call such
a policy an optimal robust best-effort (ORBE) policy. We prove that ORBE
policies always exist, characterize their structure, and present an algorithm
to compute them with a small overhead compared to standard robust value
iteration. ORBE policies offer a principled tie-breaker among optimal robust
policies. Numerical experiments show the feasibility of our approach.

Conclusion: 知识图谱与AI结合的方法为急救场景提供了创新的知识管理解决方案。

Abstract: Over the years, the need for rescue operations throughout the world has
increased rapidly. Demographic changes and the resulting risk of injury or
health disorders form the basis for emergency calls. In such scenarios, first
responders are in a rush to reach the patient in need, provide first aid, and
save lives. In these situations, they must be able to provide personalized and
optimized healthcare in the shortest possible time and estimate the patients
condition with the help of freshly recorded vital data in an emergency
situation. However, in such a timedependent situation, first responders and
medical experts cannot fully grasp their knowledge and need assistance and
recommendation for further medical treatments. To achieve this, on the spot
calculated, evaluated, and processed knowledge must be made available to
improve treatments by first responders. The Knowledge Graph presented in this
article as a central knowledge representation provides first responders with an
innovative knowledge management that enables intelligent treatment
recommendations with an artificial intelligence-based pre-recognition of the
situation.

Motivation: 当前结合LLM和EA的方法通常演化单个解，导致LLM调用成本高昂，限制了其在高维问题中的应用。

Method: X-evolve通过LLM生成可调程序，定义可调解空间，并利用基于分数的搜索算法高效探索该空间。

Result: 在三个优化问题上取得突破：发现更大的部分允许集（cap set问题）、更大的独立集（信息论问题）以及更优的启发式算法（在线装箱问题）。

Conclusion: X-evolve通过演化解空间显著提升了搜索效率，为高维优化问题提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: While combining large language models (LLMs) with evolutionary algorithms
(EAs) shows promise for solving complex optimization problems, current
approaches typically evolve individual solutions, often incurring high LLM call
costs. We introduce \(X\)-evolve, a paradigm-shifting method that instead
evolves solution spaces \(X\) (sets of individual solutions) - subsets of the
overall search space \(S\). In \(X\)-evolve, LLMs generate tunable programs
wherein certain code snippets, designated as parameters, define a tunable
solution space. A score-based search algorithm then efficiently explores this
parametrically defined space, guided by feedback from objective function
scores. This strategy enables broader and more efficient exploration, which can
potentially accelerate convergence at a much lower search cost, requiring up to
two orders of magnitude fewer LLM calls than prior leading methods. We
demonstrate \(X\)-evolve's efficacy across three distinct hard optimization
problems. For the cap set problem, we discover a larger partial admissible set,
establishing a new tighter asymptotic lower bound for the cap set constant (\(C
\ge 2.2203\)). In information theory, we uncover a larger independent set for
the 15-vertex cycle graph (\(\mathcal{C}_{15}^{\boxtimes 5}\), size 19,946),
thereby raising the known lower bound on its Shannon capacity. Furthermore, for
the NP-hard online bin packing problem, we generate heuristics that
consistently outperform standard strategies across established benchmarks. By
evolving solution spaces, our method considerably improves search
effectiveness, making it possible to tackle high-dimensional problems that were
previously computationally prohibitive.

Motivation: 在无通信或标识的受限环境中，机器人运动易发生碰撞，需低成本解决方案。

Method: 使用LSTM预测机器人位置，动态调整DQN奖励以预判碰撞风险。

Result: 在1Hz采样频率下，碰撞次数显著减少，稳定性提升。

Conclusion: 该方法计算成本低，适合嵌入式系统。

Abstract: This article proposes a collision risk anticipation method based on
short-term prediction of the agents position. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
model, trained on past trajectories, is used to estimate the next position of
each robot. This prediction allows us to define an anticipated collision risk
by dynamically modulating the reward of a Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN) agent.
The approach is tested in a constrained environment, where two robots move
without communication or identifiers. Despite a limited sampling frequency (1
Hz), the results show a significant decrease of the collisions number and a
stability improvement. The proposed method, which is computationally
inexpensive, appears particularly attractive for implementation on embedded

Abstract: Forensic cause-of-death determination faces systemic challenges, including
workforce shortages and diagnostic variability, particularly in high-volume
systems like China's medicolegal infrastructure. We introduce FEAT (ForEnsic
AgenT), a multi-agent AI framework that automates and standardizes death
investigations through a domain-adapted large language model. FEAT's
application-oriented architecture integrates: (i) a central Planner for task
decomposition, (ii) specialized Local Solvers for evidence analysis, (iii) a
Memory & Reflection module for iterative refinement, and (iv) a Global Solver
for conclusion synthesis. The system employs tool-augmented reasoning,
hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation, forensic-tuned LLMs, and
human-in-the-loop feedback to ensure legal and medical validity. In evaluations
across diverse Chinese case cohorts, FEAT outperformed state-of-the-art AI
systems in both long-form autopsy analyses and concise cause-of-death
conclusions. It demonstrated robust generalization across six geographic
regions and achieved high expert concordance in blinded validations. Senior
pathologists validated FEAT's outputs as comparable to those of human experts,
with improved detection of subtle evidentiary nuances. To our knowledge, FEAT
is the first LLM-based AI agent system dedicated to forensic medicine, offering
scalable, consistent death certification while maintaining expert-level rigor.
By integrating AI efficiency with human oversight, this work could advance
equitable access to reliable medicolegal services while addressing critical
capacity constraints in forensic systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于LLM的、不确定性感知的框架，用于解析美联储的‘Fedspeak’语言并分类其隐含的货币政策立场。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美联储使用‘Fedspeak’作为沟通工具，其隐含的政策信号对金融市场和经济预测具有重要影响，因此自动解析‘Fedspeak’是一个高价值挑战。

Method: 结合货币政策传导机制的领域特定推理，增强‘Fedspeak’文本的语义和上下文表示，并引入动态不确定性解码模块以评估模型预测的置信度。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在政策立场分析任务上达到最优性能，且感知不确定性与模型错误率显著正相关。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提升了分类准确性，还通过感知不确定性增强了模型可靠性，验证了其作为诊断信号的有效性。

Abstract: "Fedspeak", the stylized and often nuanced language used by the U.S. Federal
Reserve, encodes implicit policy signals and strategic stances. The Federal
Open Market Committee strategically employs Fedspeak as a communication tool to
shape market expectations and influence both domestic and global economic
conditions. As such, automatically parsing and interpreting Fedspeak presents a
high-impact challenge, with significant implications for financial forecasting,
algorithmic trading, and data-driven policy analysis. In this paper, we propose
an LLM-based, uncertainty-aware framework for deciphering Fedspeak and
classifying its underlying monetary policy stance. Technically, to enrich the
semantic and contextual representation of Fedspeak texts, we incorporate
domain-specific reasoning grounded in the monetary policy transmission
mechanism. We further introduce a dynamic uncertainty decoding module to assess
the confidence of model predictions, thereby enhancing both classification
accuracy and model reliability. Experimental results demonstrate that our
framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the policy stance analysis
task. Moreover, statistical analysis reveals a significant positive correlation
between perceptual uncertainty and model error rates, validating the
effectiveness of perceptual uncertainty as a diagnostic signal.

Motivation: 解决本体介导查询中如何根据正负示例拟合出满足条件的本体的问题。

Method: 使用描述逻辑ALC和ALCI作为本体语言，结合多种查询语言（AQs、CQs、UCQs），分析拟合问题的有效特征和计算复杂度。

Result: 对于AQs和完整CQs，问题为CONP复杂度；对于CQs和UCQs，问题为2EXPTIME完全复杂度。

Conclusion: 在ALC和ALCI中，拟合问题的复杂度因查询语言不同而异，为实际应用提供了理论依据。

Abstract: We study a fitting problem inspired by ontology-mediated querying: given a
collection
  of positive and negative examples of
  the form $(\mathcal{A},q)$ with
  $\mathcal{A}$ an ABox and $q$ a Boolean query, we seek
  an ontology $\mathcal{O}$ that satisfies $\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{O} \vDash
q$ for all positive examples and $\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{O}\not\vDash q$ for
all negative examples.
  We consider the description logics $\mathcal{ALC}$ and $\mathcal{ALCI}$ as
ontology languages and
  a range of query languages that
  includes atomic queries (AQs), conjunctive queries (CQs), and unions thereof
(UCQs).
  For all of the resulting fitting problems,
  we provide
  effective characterizations and determine the computational complexity
  of deciding whether a fitting ontology exists. This problem turns out to be
${\small CO}NP$ for AQs and full CQs
  and $2E{\small XP}T{\small IME}$-complete for CQs and UCQs.
  These results hold for both $\mathcal{ALC}$ and $\mathcal{ALCI}$.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖静态模板或手动设计的工作流，限制了适应性和扩展性，AdaptFlow旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用双层优化方案：内层循环通过LLM生成的反馈优化特定子任务的工作流，外层循环更新共享初始化以适应多任务。

Result: 在问答、代码生成和数学推理任务中，AdaptFlow表现优于手动设计和自动搜索的基线，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: AdaptFlow通过语言引导的修改实现了对新任务的有效泛化，展示了其适应性和扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest
in agentic workflows, which are structured sequences of LLM invocations
intended to solve complex tasks. However, existing approaches often rely on
static templates or manually designed workflows, which limit adaptability to
diverse tasks and hinder scalability. We propose AdaptFlow, a natural
language-based meta-learning framework inspired by model-agnostic meta-learning
(MAML). AdaptFlow learns a generalizable workflow initialization that enables
rapid subtask-level adaptation. It employs a bi-level optimization scheme: the
inner loop refines the workflow for a specific subtask using LLM-generated
feedback, while the outer loop updates the shared initialization to perform
well across tasks. This setup allows AdaptFlow to generalize effectively to
unseen tasks by adapting the initialized workflow through language-guided
modifications. Evaluated across question answering, code generation, and
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, AdaptFlow consistently outperforms both
manually crafted and automatically searched baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art results with strong generalization across tasks and models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Dempster-Shafer理论的开放世界信息融合方法FNBT，解决了异质框架下的信息融合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中数据来源或模型可能来自不同区域或组织，导致异质框架，传统融合方法效果不佳。

Method: 引入标准判断是否为开放世界任务，扩展框架以容纳异质元素，并采用全否定机制转换质量函数。

Result: 理论证明FNBT满足质量函数不变性、遗传性和冲突消除性，实验显示其在分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: FNBT有效解决了异质框架下的信息融合问题，具有理论和实践价值。

Abstract: The Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence has been widely applied in the field
of information fusion under uncertainty. Most existing research focuses on
combining evidence within the same frame of discernment. However, in real-world
scenarios, trained algorithms or data often originate from different regions or
organizations, where data silos are prevalent. As a result, using different
data sources or models to generate basic probability assignments may lead to
heterogeneous frames, for which traditional fusion methods often yield
unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, this study proposes an
open-world information fusion method, termed Full Negation Belief
Transformation (FNBT), based on the Dempster-Shafer theory. More specially, a
criterion is introduced to determine whether a given fusion task belongs to the
open-world setting. Then, by extending the frames, the method can accommodate
elements from heterogeneous frames. Finally, a full negation mechanism is
employed to transform the mass functions, so that existing combination rules
can be applied to the transformed mass functions for such information fusion.
Theoretically, the proposed method satisfies three desirable properties, which
are formally proven: mass function invariance, heritability, and essential
conflict elimination. Empirically, FNBT demonstrates superior performance in
pattern classification tasks on real-world datasets and successfully resolves
Zadeh's counterexample, thereby validating its practical effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将人类团队合作的理论模型（如Salas的“Big Five”模型）转化为计算多智能体系统的协作机制，以提升医疗决策的准确性和效率。

Method: 通过模块化、可配置的协作架构实现六个团队合作组件（如团队领导力、共享心智模型等），并评估不同任务和领域中智能体数量的影响。

Result: 在8个医疗基准测试中，7个数据集表现显著提升，并通过消融实验揭示了不同任务和领域的最优团队配置。

Conclusion: TeamMedAgents为关键决策领域的多智能体系统设计提供了理论基础，实现了人类团队合作理论到AI协作的系统转化。

Abstract: We present TeamMedAgents, a novel multi-agent approach that systematically
integrates evidence-based teamwork components from human-human collaboration
into medical decision-making with large language models (LLMs). Our approach
validates an organizational psychology teamwork model from human collaboration
to computational multi-agent medical systems by operationalizing six core
teamwork components derived from Salas et al.'s "Big Five" model: team
leadership, mutual performance monitoring, team orientation, shared mental
models, closed-loop communication, and mutual trust. We implement and evaluate
these components as modular, configurable mechanisms within an adaptive
collaboration architecture while assessing the effect of the number of agents
involved based on the task's requirements and domain. Systematic evaluation of
computational implementations of teamwork behaviors across eight medical
benchmarks (MedQA, MedMCQA, MMLU-Pro Medical, PubMedQA, DDXPlus, MedBullets,
Path-VQA, and PMC-VQA) demonstrates consistent improvements across 7 out of 8
evaluated datasets. Controlled ablation studies conducted on 50 questions per
configuration across 3 independent runs provide mechanistic insights into
individual component contributions, revealing optimal teamwork configurations
that vary by reasoning task complexity and domain-specific requirements. Our
ablation analyses reveal dataset-specific optimal teamwork configurations,
indicating that different medical reasoning modalities benefit from distinct
collaborative patterns. TeamMedAgents represents an advancement in
collaborative AI by providing a systematic translation of established teamwork
theories from human collaboration into agentic collaboration, establishing a
foundation for evidence-based multi-agent system design in critical
decision-making domains.

TL;DR: BlindGuard是一种无监督防御方法，用于检测多智能体系统中的恶意代理，无需攻击标签或先验知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督防御方法依赖标记数据，不适用于现实场景，因此需要一种无需标签的通用防御方法。

Method: BlindGuard通过分层代理编码器捕捉个体、邻域和全局交互模式，并结合噪声注入和对比学习训练检测模型。

Result: 实验表明，BlindGuard能有效检测多种攻击类型，且在通用性上优于监督基线方法。

Conclusion: BlindGuard为多智能体系统提供了一种实用且通用的无监督防御解决方案。

Abstract: The security of LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) is critically threatened
by propagation vulnerability, where malicious agents can distort collective
decision-making through inter-agent message interactions. While existing
supervised defense methods demonstrate promising performance, they may be
impractical in real-world scenarios due to their heavy reliance on labeled
malicious agents to train a supervised malicious detection model. To enable
practical and generalizable MAS defenses, in this paper, we propose BlindGuard,
an unsupervised defense method that learns without requiring any
attack-specific labels or prior knowledge of malicious behaviors. To this end,
we establish a hierarchical agent encoder to capture individual, neighborhood,
and global interaction patterns of each agent, providing a comprehensive
understanding for malicious agent detection. Meanwhile, we design a
corruption-guided detector that consists of directional noise injection and
contrastive learning, allowing effective detection model training solely on
normal agent behaviors. Extensive experiments show that BlindGuard effectively
detects diverse attack types (i.e., prompt injection, memory poisoning, and
tool attack) across MAS with various communication patterns while maintaining
superior generalizability compared to supervised baselines. The code is

Conclusion: 结合AI与传统优化框架，可高效连接高层问题描述与可执行数学模型，提升能源系统决策效率。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Large Language Models (LLMs)-assisted agent
that automatically converts natural-language descriptions of power system
optimization scenarios into compact, solver-ready formulations and generates
corresponding solutions. In contrast to approaches that rely solely on LLM to
produce solutions directly, the proposed method focuses on discovering a
mathematically compatible formulation that can be efficiently solved by
off-the-shelf optimization solvers. Directly using LLMs to produce solutions
often leads to infeasible or suboptimal results, as these models lack the
numerical precision and constraint-handling capabilities of established
optimization solvers. The pipeline integrates a domain-aware prompt and schema
with an LLM, enforces feasibility through systematic validation and iterative
repair, and returns both solver-ready models and user-facing results. Using the
unit commitment problem as a representative case study, the agent produces
optimal or near-optimal schedules along with the associated objective costs.
Results demonstrate that coupling the solver with task-specific validation
significantly enhances solution reliability. This work shows that combining AI
with established optimization frameworks bridges high-level problem
descriptions and executable mathematical models, enabling more efficient
decision-making in energy systems

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的生存建模理论，将生存视为生物状态空间中几何特性的结果，而非依赖标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生存建模依赖标注数据和固定协变量，作者认为生存是生物状态空间几何特性的自然结果，提出了一种无需标注的理论框架。

Method: 提出了自组织生存流形（SOSM）理论，基于低曲率测地流和生物约束构建生存能量泛函，推导离散和连续目标函数。

Result: 证明了在生物合理条件下，生存对齐轨迹的出现和收敛，将健康、疾病、衰老和死亡视为流形结构的几何相变。

Conclusion: 该理论为生存建模提供了无需标注的通用基础，连接了机器学习、生物物理和生命几何学。

Abstract: Survival is traditionally modeled as a supervised learning task, reliant on
curated outcome labels and fixed covariates. This work rejects that premise. It
proposes that survival is not an externally annotated target but a geometric
consequence: an emergent property of the curvature and flow inherent in
biological state space. We develop a theory of Self-Organizing Survival
Manifolds (SOSM), in which survival-relevant dynamics arise from low-curvature
geodesic flows on latent manifolds shaped by internal biological constraints. A
survival energy functional based on geodesic curvature minimization is
introduced and shown to induce structures where prognosis aligns with geometric
flow stability. We derive discrete and continuous formulations of the objective
and prove theoretical results demonstrating the emergence and convergence of
survival-aligned trajectories under biologically plausible conditions. The
framework draws connections to thermodynamic efficiency, entropy flow, Ricci
curvature, and optimal transport, grounding survival modeling in physical law.
Health, disease, aging, and death are reframed as geometric phase transitions
in the manifold's structure. This theory offers a universal, label-free
foundation for modeling survival as a property of form, not annotation-bridging
machine learning, biophysics, and the geometry of life itself.

Result: 在DataCo数据集上F1-score达0.817，假阳性率低于3.0%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合无监督和半监督学习，但需进一步解决概念漂移和与深度学习的对比。

Abstract: Detecting fraud in modern supply chains is a growing challenge, driven by the
complexity of global networks and the scarcity of labeled data. Traditional
detection methods often struggle with class imbalance and limited supervision,
reducing their effectiveness in real-world applications. This paper proposes a
novel two-phase learning framework to address these challenges. In the first
phase, the Isolation Forest algorithm performs unsupervised anomaly detection
to identify potential fraud cases and reduce the volume of data requiring
further analysis. In the second phase, a self-training Support Vector Machine
(SVM) refines the predictions using both labeled and high-confidence
pseudo-labeled samples, enabling robust semi-supervised learning. The proposed
method is evaluated on the DataCo Smart Supply Chain Dataset, a comprehensive
real-world supply chain dataset with fraud indicators. It achieves an F1-score
of 0.817 while maintaining a false positive rate below 3.0%. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of combining unsupervised
pre-filtering with semi-supervised refinement for supply chain fraud detection
under real-world constraints, though we acknowledge limitations regarding
concept drift and the need for comparison with deep learning approaches.

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions pose a significant challenge in clinical pharmacology,
with severe class imbalance among interaction types limiting the effectiveness

critical interactions remain underrepresented, leading to poor model
performance on infrequent cases. Existing methods often treat DDI prediction as

generate effective and novel DDI pairs. Our approach enhances predictive
performance across interaction types, ensuring better clinical reliability.

Result: 在多个数据集上，HGMN显著优于现有GNN方法，尤其在节点分类任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: HGMN通过融合角色特征和邻接信息，提供了更丰富的节点表示，适用于多种图学习任务。

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant
attention for node classification tasks on graph-structured data. However,
traditional GNNs primarily focus on adjacency relationships between nodes,
often overlooking the rich role-based characteristics that are crucial for
learning more expressive node representations. Existing methods for capturing
role-based features are largely unsupervised and fail to achieve optimal
performance in downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel hypergraph neural network with state space model (HGMN) that effectively
integrates role-aware representations into GNNs and the state space model. HGMN
utilizes hypergraph construction techniques to model higher-order relationships
and combines role-based and adjacency-based representations through a learnable
mamba transformer mechanism. By leveraging two distinct hypergraph construction
methods-based on node degree and neighborhood levels, it strengthens the
connections among nodes with similar roles, enhancing the model's
representational power. Additionally, the inclusion of hypergraph convolution
layers enables the model to capture complex dependencies within hypergraph
structures. To mitigate the over-smoothing problem inherent in deep GNNs, we
incorporate a residual network, ensuring improved stability and better feature
propagation across layers. Extensive experiments conducted on one newly
introduced dataset and four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of
HGMN. The model achieves significant performance improvements on node
classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art GNN methods. These results
highlight HGMN's ability to provide enriched node representations by
effectively embedding role-based features alongside adjacency information,
making it a versatile and powerful tool for a variety of graph-based learning
applications.

Method: 提出RGVQ框架，结合图拓扑和特征相似性作为正则化信号，引入Gumbel-Softmax重参数化和结构感知对比正则化。

Result: 实验表明RGVQ显著提升码本利用率，并在多个下游任务中增强图VQ骨干模型的性能。

Conclusion: RGVQ通过正则化和软分配有效解决了图VQ中的码本崩溃问题，提升了图令牌的表达性和可迁移性。

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) has recently emerged as a promising approach for
learning discrete representations of graph-structured data. However, a
fundamental challenge, i.e., codebook collapse, remains underexplored in the
graph domain, significantly limiting the expressiveness and generalization of
graph tokens.In this paper, we present the first empirical study showing that
codebook collapse consistently occurs when applying VQ to graph data, even with
mitigation strategies proposed in vision or language domains. To understand why
graph VQ is particularly vulnerable to collapse, we provide a theoretical
analysis and identify two key factors: early assignment imbalances caused by
redundancy in graph features and structural patterns, and self-reinforcing
optimization loops in deterministic VQ. To address these issues, we propose
RGVQ, a novel framework that integrates graph topology and feature similarity
as explicit regularization signals to enhance codebook utilization and promote
token diversity. RGVQ introduces soft assignments via Gumbel-Softmax
reparameterization, ensuring that all codewords receive gradient updates. In
addition, RGVQ incorporates a structure-aware contrastive regularization to
penalize the token co-assignments among similar node pairs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RGVQ substantially improves codebook utilization
and consistently boosts the performance of state-of-the-art graph VQ backbones
across multiple downstream tasks, enabling more expressive and transferable
graph token representations.

Abstract: Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems play a crucial role in analyzing
neuroimaging data for neurological and psychiatric disorders. However,
small-sample studies suffer from low reproducibility, while large-scale
datasets introduce confounding heterogeneity due to multiple disease subtypes
being labeled under a single category. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel federated learning framework tailored for neuroimaging CAD systems. Our
approach includes a dynamic navigation module that routes samples to the most
suitable local models based on latent subtype representations, and a
meta-integration module that combines predictions from heterogeneous local
models into a unified diagnostic output. We evaluated our framework using a
comprehensive dataset comprising fMRI data from over 1300 MDD patients and 1100
healthy controls across multiple study cohorts. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy and robustness
compared to traditional methods. Specifically, our framework achieved an
average accuracy of 74.06\% across all tested sites, showcasing its
effectiveness in handling subtype heterogeneity and enhancing model
generalizability. Ablation studies further confirmed the importance of both the
dynamic navigation and meta-integration modules in improving performance. By
addressing data heterogeneity and subtype confounding, our framework advances
reliable and reproducible neuroimaging CAD systems, offering significant
potential for personalized medicine and clinical decision-making in neurology
and psychiatry.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）在知识检索和创意生成方面有广泛应用，但在多学科交叉的实验科学（如材料科学）中应用有限。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用包括微调模型（BioinspiredLLM）、检索增强生成（RAG）、代理系统和分层采样策略在内的AI工具，从植物科学、仿生学和材料工程等领域提取结构-性能关系。

Result: 通过实验室测试验证了AI生成的材料设计和机械预测，成功制备了一种新型花粉基粘合剂，具有可调形态和实测剪切强度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have reshaped the research landscape by enabling
new approaches to knowledge retrieval and creative ideation. Yet their
application in discipline-specific experimental science, particularly in highly
multi-disciplinary domains like materials science, remains limited. We present
a first-of-its-kind framework that integrates generative AI with literature
from hitherto-unconnected fields such as plant science, biomimetics, and
materials engineering to extract insights and design experiments for materials.
We focus on humidity-responsive systems such as pollen-based materials and
Rhapis excelsa (broadleaf lady palm) leaves, which exhibit self-actuation and
adaptive performance. Using a suite of AI tools, including a fine-tuned model
(BioinspiredLLM), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agentic systems, and a
Hierarchical Sampling strategy, we extract structure-property relationships and
translate them into new classes of bioinspired materials. Structured inference
protocols generate and evaluate hundreds of hypotheses from a single query,
surfacing novel and experimentally tractable ideas. We validate our approach
through real-world implementation: LLM-generated procedures, materials designs,
and mechanical predictions were tested in the laboratory, culminating in the
fabrication of a novel pollen-based adhesive with tunable morphology and
measured shear strength, establishing a foundation for future plant-derived
adhesive design. This work demonstrates how AI-assisted ideation can drive
real-world materials design and enable effective human-AI collaboration.

TL;DR: 研究探讨通过过滤训练数据中的双用途主题文本，防止开放权重AI系统被篡改攻击，并提出一种多阶段数据过滤方法，显著提升模型对抗攻击的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放权重AI系统虽具透明性和开放性，但易受篡改攻击，现有安全微调方法难以抵御多步对抗攻击，需探索更有效的防御手段。

Method: 提出多阶段数据过滤管道，预训练6.9B参数模型，测试其对生物威胁相关文本的对抗微调攻击的抵抗力。

Result: 过滤后的模型在10,000步和300M令牌的对抗攻击下表现优异，远超现有基线，且不影响其他能力。但模型仍能通过上下文利用危险信息。

Conclusion: 预训练数据过滤是开放权重AI系统的有效防御层，但需结合多层次防御策略。

Abstract: Open-weight AI systems offer unique benefits, including enhanced
transparency, open research, and decentralized access. However, they are
vulnerable to tampering attacks which can efficiently elicit harmful behaviors
by modifying weights or activations. Currently, there is not yet a robust
science of open-weight model risk management. Existing safety fine-tuning
methods and other post-training techniques have struggled to make LLMs
resistant to more than a few dozen steps of adversarial fine-tuning. In this
paper, we investigate whether filtering text about dual-use topics from
training data can prevent unwanted capabilities and serve as a more
tamper-resistant safeguard. We introduce a multi-stage pipeline for scalable
data filtering and show that it offers a tractable and effective method for
minimizing biothreat proxy knowledge in LLMs. We pretrain multiple
6.9B-parameter models from scratch and find that they exhibit substantial
resistance to adversarial fine-tuning attacks on up to 10,000 steps and 300M
tokens of biothreat-related text -- outperforming existing post-training
baselines by over an order of magnitude -- with no observed degradation to
unrelated capabilities. However, while filtered models lack internalized
dangerous knowledge, we find that they can still leverage such information when
it is provided in context (e.g., via search tool augmentation), demonstrating a
need for a defense-in-depth approach. Overall, these findings help to establish
pretraining data curation as a promising layer of defense for open-weight AI
systems.

Result: 证明在相变点附近需全局神经网络，其他时间可用小型局部网络，显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 为扩散模型设计提供新思路，并推动生成式AI和物理启发神经网络的研究。

Abstract: As a class of generative artificial intelligence frameworks inspired by
statistical physics, diffusion models have shown extraordinary performance in
synthesizing complicated data distributions through a denoising process
gradually guided by score functions. Real-life data, like images, is often
spatially structured in low-dimensional spaces. However, ordinary diffusion
models ignore this local structure and learn spatially global score functions,
which are often computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce a new
perspective on the phases of data distributions, which provides insight into
constructing local denoisers with reduced computational costs. We define two
distributions as belonging to the same data distribution phase if they can be
mutually connected via spatially local operations such as local denoisers.
Then, we show that the reverse denoising process consists of an early trivial
phase and a late data phase, sandwiching a rapid phase transition where local
denoisers must fail. To diagnose such phase transitions, we prove an
information-theoretic bound on the fidelity of local denoisers based on
conditional mutual information, and conduct numerical experiments in a
real-world dataset. This work suggests simpler and more efficient architectures
of diffusion models: far from the phase transition point, we can use small
local neural networks to compute the score function; global neural networks are
only necessary around the narrow time interval of phase transitions. This
result also opens up new directions for studying phases of data distributions,
the broader science of generative artificial intelligence, and guiding the
design of neural networks inspired by physics concepts.

Motivation: 随着语言模型规模和计算成本的快速增长，需要更高效的训练技术和资源分配方法，但目前的方法多为特定架构设计。

Method: 重新审视现有扩展法则，提出一种适用于密集和稀疏模型的通用扩展法则框架。

Result: 通过评估和比较，证明了所提扩展法则的有效性。

Conclusion: 通用扩展法则为不同架构的大型语言模型提供了统一的优化框架。

Abstract: Over the past few years, the size of language models has grown exponentially,
as has the computational cost to train these large models. This rapid growth
has motivated researchers to develop new techniques aimed at enhancing the
efficiency of the training process. Despite these advancements, optimally
predicting the model size or allocating optimal resources remains a challenge.
Several efforts have addressed the challenge by proposing different scaling
laws, but almost all of them are architecture-specific (dense or sparse). In
this work we revisit existing scaling laws and propose a generalized scaling
law to provide a unified framework that is applicable to both dense and sparse
large language models. We evaluate and compare our proposed scaling law with
existing scaling laws to demonstrate its effectiveness.

Motivation: 解决训练数据中固有或由对手引入的噪声标签问题，减少噪声样本对学习的影响。

Method: 通过信息差异邻域的松弛定义目标函数，利用凸对偶性转化为对抗训练方法。

Result: 在不同类型的噪声标签（对称、非对称、人工标注和真实噪声）下表现优异，计算效率接近标准交叉熵损失。

Conclusion: ANTIDOTE能有效减少噪声标签的影响，性能优于现有方法，且计算成本低。

Abstract: We introduce ANTIDOTE, a new class of objectives for learning under noisy
labels which are defined in terms of a relaxation over an
information-divergence neighborhood. Using convex duality, we provide a
reformulation as an adversarial training method that has similar computational
cost to training with standard cross-entropy loss. We show that our approach
adaptively reduces the influence of the samples with noisy labels during
learning, exhibiting a behavior that is analogous to forgetting those samples.
ANTIDOTE is effective in practical environments where label noise is inherent
in the training data or where an adversary can alter the training labels.
Extensive empirical evaluations on different levels of symmetric, asymmetric,
human annotation, and real-world label noise show that ANTIDOTE outperforms
leading comparable losses in the field and enjoys a time complexity that is
very close to that of the standard cross entropy loss.

Result: 在4700名患者数据上，AUC显著提升，并识别出与PDAC风险相关的诊断代码和实验室指标。

Conclusion: 该方法在PDAC早期检测中表现优异，并发现新的潜在生物标志物。

Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest cancers, and
early detection remains a major clinical challenge due to the absence of
specific symptoms and reliable biomarkers. In this work, we propose a new
multimodal approach that integrates longitudinal diagnosis code histories and
routinely collected laboratory measurements from electronic health records to
detect PDAC up to one year prior to clinical diagnosis. Our method combines
neural controlled differential equations to model irregular lab time series,
pretrained language models and recurrent networks to learn diagnosis code
trajectory representations, and cross-attention mechanisms to capture
interactions between the two modalities. We develop and evaluate our approach
on a real-world dataset of nearly 4,700 patients and achieve significant
improvements in AUC ranging from 6.5% to 15.5% over state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, our model identifies diagnosis codes and laboratory panels
associated with elevated PDAC risk, including both established and new
biomarkers. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 新估计器在计算社会科学应用中表现优异，为合成数据与真实数据结合提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Predictions and generations from large language models are increasingly being
explored as an aid to computational social science and human subject research
in limited data regimes. While previous technical work has explored the
potential to use model-predicted labels for unlabeled data in a principled
manner, there is increasing interest in using large language models to generate
entirely new synthetic samples (also termed as synthetic simulations), such as
in responses to surveys. However, it is not immediately clear by what means
practitioners can combine such data with real data and yet produce
statistically valid conclusions upon them. In this work, we introduce a new
estimator based on generalized method of moments, providing a
hyperparameter-free solution with strong theoretical guarantees to address the
challenge at hand. Surprisingly, we find that interactions between the moment
residuals of synthetic data and those of real data can improve estimates of the
target parameter. We empirically validate the finite-sample performance of our
estimator across different regression tasks in computational social science
applications, demonstrating large empirical gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态阈值在非平稳环境中容易失效，需要适应统计特性随时间变化的场景。

Method: 提出了两种基于统计在线学习和分段原则的自适应阈值框架：SCS和MACS。

Result: 在Wafer Manufacturing数据集上，相比传统方法，F1分数显著提升。

Conclusion: 自适应阈值框架能够实现可靠、可解释且及时的异常检测。

Abstract: As time series data become increasingly prevalent in domains such as
manufacturing, IT, and infrastructure monitoring, anomaly detection must adapt
to nonstationary environments where statistical properties shift over time.
Traditional static thresholds are easily rendered obsolete by regime shifts,
concept drift, or multi-scale changes. To address these challenges, we
introduce and empirically evaluate two novel adaptive thresholding frameworks:
Segmented Confidence Sequences (SCS) and Multi-Scale Adaptive Confidence
Segments (MACS). Both leverage statistical online learning and segmentation
principles for local, contextually sensitive adaptation, maintaining guarantees
on false alarm rates even under evolving distributions. Our experiments across
Wafer Manufacturing benchmark datasets show significant F1-score improvement
compared to traditional percentile and rolling quantile approaches. This work
demonstrates that robust, statistically principled adaptive thresholds enable
reliable, interpretable, and timely detection of diverse real-world anomalies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的通用序列映射（USM）方法，解决了迭代过程中的种子偏差问题，实现了序列身份与数值定位的完全一致，并揭示了USM作为高效数值过程的特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于Transformer的语言模型（如ChatGPT）的兴起，研究者对多尺度和嵌入维度下符号序列的数值表示方法重新产生兴趣。编码的挑战在于需要保留符号序列的上下文信息，以便通过非线性模型（如神经网络）进行建模。

Method: USM是一种双射迭代函数，通过正向和反向的混沌游戏表示（CGR）将符号序列编码到数值空间，并投影到频域（FCGR）。USM坐标可用于计算切比雪夫距离和k-mer频率，无需重新计算数值坐标。

Result: 研究解决了USM迭代过程中的种子偏差问题，实现了序列身份与数值定位的完全一致，并发现USM是一种高效收敛于稳态序列嵌入的数值过程。实验以基因组序列为例，但方法适用于任意基数字母表。

Conclusion: 改进的USM方法不仅解决了种子偏差问题，还揭示了其作为高效数值过程的特性，为符号序列的数值表示提供了新思路。

Abstract: Motivation: With the advent of Language Models using Transformers,
popularized by ChatGPT, there is a renewed interest in exploring encoding
procedures that numerically represent symbolic sequences at multiple scales and
embedding dimensions. The challenge that encoding addresses is the need for
mechanisms that uniquely retain contextual information about the succession of
individual symbols, which can then be modeled by nonlinear formulations such as
neural networks.
  Context: Universal Sequence Maps(USM) are iterated functions that bijectively
encode symbolic sequences onto embedded numerical spaces. USM is composed of
two Chaos Game Representations (CGR), iterated forwardly and backwardly, that
can be projected into the frequency domain (FCGR). The corresponding USM
coordinates can be used to compute a Chebyshev distance metric as well as k-mer
frequencies, without having to recompute the embedded numeric coordinates, and,
paradoxically, allowing for non-integers values of k.
  Results: This report advances the bijective fractal encoding by Universal
Sequence Maps (USM) by resolving seeding biases affecting the iterated process.
The resolution had two results, the first expected, the second an intriguing
outcome: 1) full reconciliation of numeric positioning with sequence identity;
and 2) uncovering the nature of USM as an efficient numeric process converging
towards a steady state sequence embedding solution. We illustrate these results
for genomic sequences because of the convenience of a planar representation
defined by an alphabet with only 4 tokens (the 4 nucleotides). Nevertheless,
the application to alphabet of arbitrary cardinality was found to be
straightforward.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation has become essential for securely sharing and
analyzing sensitive data sets. Traditional anonymization techniques, however,
often fail to adequately preserve privacy. We introduce the Tabular
Auto-Regressive Generative Network (TabularARGN), a neural network architecture
specifically designed for generating high-quality synthetic tabular data. Using
a discretization-based auto-regressive approach, TabularARGN achieves high data
fidelity while remaining computationally efficient. We evaluate TabularARGN
against existing synthetic data generation methods, showing competitive results
in statistical similarity, machine learning utility, and detection robustness.
We further perform an in-depth privacy evaluation using systematic
membership-inference attacks, highlighting the robustness and effective
privacy-utility balance of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RL代理在新任务和环境中泛化能力不足的问题，避免因训练环境过拟合导致的性能下降。

Method: 将上下文RL（ICRL）建模为双代理通信问题，引入CORAL框架，通过信息代理（IA）预训练世界模型并生成简洁消息，控制代理（CA）利用这些消息解决任务。

Result: 实验表明，CORAL能显著提升样本效率，并在未见过的稀疏奖励环境中实现零样本适应。

Conclusion: 学习可迁移的通信表示是提升RL代理上下文适应能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents often struggle to generalize to new tasks
and contexts without updating their parameters, mainly because their learned
representations and policies are overfit to the specifics of their training
environments. To boost agents' in-context RL (ICRL) ability, this work
formulates ICRL as a two-agent emergent communication problem and introduces
CORAL (Communicative Representation for Adaptive RL), a framework that learns a
transferable communicative context by decoupling latent representation learning
from control. In CORAL, an Information Agent (IA) is pre-trained as a world
model on a diverse distribution of tasks. Its objective is not to maximize task
reward, but to build a world model and distill its understanding into concise
messages. The emergent communication protocol is shaped by a novel Causal
Influence Loss, which measures the effect that the message has on the next
action. During deployment, the previously trained IA serves as a fixed
contextualizer for a new Control Agent (CA), which learns to solve tasks by
interpreting the provided communicative context. Our experiments demonstrate
that this approach enables the CA to achieve significant gains in sample
efficiency and successfully perform zero-shot adaptation with the help of
pre-trained IA in entirely unseen sparse-reward environments, validating the
efficacy of learning a transferable communicative representation.

Conclusion: KANs能增强GNN表达能力，并实现高效的图无关推理。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown strong performance on
graph-structured data, but their reliance on graph connectivity often limits
scalability and efficiency. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), a recent
architecture with learnable univariate functions, offer strong nonlinear
expressiveness and efficient inference. In this work, we integrate KANs into
three popular GNN architectures-GAT, SGC, and APPNP-resulting in three new
models: KGAT, KSGC, and KAPPNP. We further adopt a multi-teacher knowledge
amalgamation framework, where knowledge from multiple KAN-based GNNs is
distilled into a graph-independent KAN student model. Experiments on benchmark
datasets show that the proposed models improve node classification accuracy,
and the knowledge amalgamation approach significantly boosts student model
performance. Our findings highlight the potential of KANs for enhancing GNN
expressiveness and for enabling efficient, graph-free inference.

Result: 实验表明DCT-AW对模型性能影响小，且能抵抗微调、剪枝等攻击。

Conclusion: DCT-AW是一种适用于KAN的有效水印方法，具有任务独立性和强鲁棒性。

Abstract: With the increasing importance of protecting intellectual property in machine
learning, watermarking techniques have gained significant attention. As
advanced models are increasingly deployed in domains such as social network
analysis, the need for robust model protection becomes even more critical.
While existing watermarking methods have demonstrated effectiveness for
conventional deep neural networks, they often fail to adapt to the novel
architecture, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), which feature learnable
activation functions. KAN holds strong potential for modeling complex
relationships in network-structured data. However, their unique design also
introduces new challenges for watermarking. Therefore, we propose a novel
watermarking method, Discrete Cosine Transform-based Activation Watermarking
(DCT-AW), tailored for KAN. Leveraging the learnable activation functions of
KAN, our method embeds watermarks by perturbing activation outputs using
discrete cosine transform, ensuring compatibility with diverse tasks and
achieving task independence. Experimental results demonstrate that DCT-AW has a
small impact on model performance and provides superior robustness against
various watermark removal attacks, including fine-tuning, pruning, and
retraining after pruning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中因客户端数据多样性导致的训练不稳定问题。

Method: 提出HeteRo-Select框架，基于客户端有用性、公平性、更新速度和数据多样性进行评分。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，HeteRo-Select的峰值准确率为74.75%，最终准确率为72.76%，稳定性下降仅为1.99%。

Conclusion: HeteRo-Select是解决异构联邦学习问题的可靠方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning technique that often suffers
from training instability due to the diverse nature of client data. Although
utility-based client selection methods like Oort are used to converge by
prioritizing high-loss clients, they frequently experience significant drops in
accuracy during later stages of training. We propose a theoretical
HeteRo-Select framework designed to maintain high performance and ensure
long-term training stability. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that
when client data is very different (high heterogeneity), choosing a smart
subset of client participation can reduce communication more effectively
compared to full participation. Our HeteRo-Select method uses a clear,
step-by-step scoring system that considers client usefulness, fairness, update
speed, and data variety. It also shows convergence guarantees under strong
regularization. Our experimental results on the CIFAR-10 dataset under
significant label skew ($\alpha=0.1$) support the theoretical findings. The
HeteRo-Select method performs better than existing approaches in terms of peak
accuracy, final accuracy, and training stability. Specifically, HeteRo-Select
achieves a peak accuracy of $74.75\%$, a final accuracy of $72.76\%$, and a
minimal stability drop of $1.99\%$. In contrast, Oort records a lower peak
accuracy of $73.98\%$, a final accuracy of $71.25\%$, and a larger stability
drop of $2.73\%$. The theoretical foundations and empirical performance in our
study make HeteRo-Select a reliable solution for real-world heterogeneous FL
problems.

TL;DR: CISO是一种基于深度学习的物种分布建模方法，能够结合不完整的物种观察数据与环境变量，提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物种分布模型（SDMs）通常忽略物种间的生物相互作用，且依赖对称的成对关系和完整数据。CISO旨在解决这些问题。

Method: CISO利用深度学习，允许在预测中灵活结合不完整的物种观察数据与环境变量，适用于不同数据集（如sPlotOpen、SatBird、SatButterfly）。

Result: CISO在空间分离测试集上表现优于其他方法，尤其在结合部分物种观察数据时。多数据集结合还能进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: CISO是一种有潜力的生态工具，能整合不完整的生物信息并识别跨类群物种间的潜在相互作用。

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to predict species'
geographic distributions, serving as critical tools for ecological research and
conservation planning. Typically, SDMs relate species occurrences to
environmental variables representing abiotic factors, such as temperature,
precipitation, and soil properties. However, species distributions are also
strongly influenced by biotic interactions with other species, which are often
overlooked. While some methods partially address this limitation by
incorporating biotic interactions, they often assume symmetrical pairwise
relationships between species and require consistent co-occurrence data. In
practice, species observations are sparse, and the availability of information
about the presence or absence of other species varies significantly across
locations. To address these challenges, we propose CISO, a deep learning-based
method for species distribution modeling Conditioned on Incomplete Species
Observations. CISO enables predictions to be conditioned on a flexible number
of species observations alongside environmental variables, accommodating the
variability and incompleteness of available biotic data. We demonstrate our
approach using three datasets representing different species groups: sPlotOpen
for plants, SatBird for birds, and a new dataset, SatButterfly, for
butterflies. Our results show that including partial biotic information
improves predictive performance on spatially separate test sets. When
conditioned on a subset of species within the same dataset, CISO outperforms
alternative methods in predicting the distribution of the remaining species.
Furthermore, we show that combining observations from multiple datasets can
improve performance. CISO is a promising ecological tool, capable of
incorporating incomplete biotic information and identifying potential
interactions between species from disparate taxa.

Conclusion: 扩展了SF的无步数依赖保证至非凸优化，并为未来最优非凸收敛率研究指明了方向。

Abstract: First-order methods underpin most large-scale learning algorithms, yet their
classical convergence guarantees hinge on carefully scheduled step-sizes that
depend on the total horizon $T$, which is rarely known in advance. The
Schedule-Free (SF) method promises optimal performance with hyperparameters
that are independent of $T$ by interpolating between Polyak--Ruppert averaging
and momentum, but nonconvex analysis of SF has been limited or reliant on
strong global assumptions. We introduce a robust Lyapunov framework that, under
only $L$-smoothness and lower-boundedness, reduces SF analysis to a single-step
descent inequality. This yields horizon-agnostic bounds in the nonconvex
setting: $O(1/\log T)$ for constant step + PR averaging, $O(\log T/T)$ for a
linearly growing step-size, and a continuum of $O(T^{-(1-\alpha)})$ rates for
polynomial averaging. We complement these proofs with Performance Estimation
Problem (PEP) experiments that numerically validate our rates and suggest that
our $O(1/\log T)$ bound on the original nonconvex SF algorithm may tighten to
$O(1/T)$. Our work extends SF's horizon-free guarantees to smooth nonconvex
optimization and charts future directions for optimal nonconvex rates.

TL;DR: Fed MobiLLM是一种高效联邦学习框架，用于在异构移动设备上微调大型语言模型，显著降低计算和通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统联邦学习方法在移动设备上计算和内存负担过重，以及同步协议导致性能瓶颈的问题。

Conclusion: Fed MobiLLM在异构移动设备上实现了高效的LLM微调，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Collaboratively fine-tuning (FT) large language models (LLMs) over
heterogeneous mobile devices fosters immense potential applications of
personalized intelligence. However, such a vision faces critical system
challenges. Conventional federated LLM FT approaches place prohibitive
computational and memory burdens on mobile hardware, and their synchronous
model aggregation protocols stall for slower devices. In this paper, we propose
Fed MobiLLM, a novel design to facilitate efficient federated LLM FT across
mobile devices with diverse computing/communication speeds and local model
architectures. In particular, Fed MobiLLM implements a pioneering
server-assisted federated side-tuning paradigm. Briefly, mobile devices perform
lightweight forward propagation computations on local data using their frozen
pre-scaled backbone LLMs, and then upload selected intermediate activations.
The server trains a shared side-network independently, eliminating client-side
backpropagation and enabling asynchronous updates. To bridge model
heterogeneity across different devices, we introduce an adaptive layer-wise
feature alignment method, which ensures consistent representations for
collaboratively tuning a shared side network. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that Fed MobiLLM can maintain robust fine-tuning performance while
achieving extremely low on-device memory, with at least 95.2% reduction in
computation overhead, 93.2% reduction in communication costs and 5.1x faster
convergence compared to existing methods, validating its efficacy for practical
LLM adaptation over heterogeneous mobile devices.

Motivation: 研究模型漂移检测的理论基础，避免依赖任务标签或输出评估。

Method: 提出ZDP框架，基于假设A1-A6，证明四个理论结果，并推导Spectral Null-Leakage (SNL) 度量。

Result: 证明了Variance-Leak定理、Fisher Null-Conservation、Rank-Leak边界和在线零空间跟踪器的对数遗憾保证。

Abstract: We present Zero-Direction Probing (ZDP), a theory-only framework for

Variance--Leak Theorem, (ii) Fisher Null-Conservation, (iii) a Rank--Leak bound

monitoring right/left null spaces of layer activations and their Fisher
geometry provides concrete, testable guarantees on representational change.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人类反馈对齐LLM时的隐私泄露问题，同时避免过度隐私保护导致模型性能下降。

Method: 提出PROPS框架，分阶段使用私有对齐模型补充训练数据，结合理论保证和实验验证。

Result: 在相同隐私预算下，PROPS的胜率比DP-SGD高3倍，比RR高2.5倍。

Conclusion: PROPS在保护隐私的同时显著提升模型性能，为LLM对齐提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Alignment is a key step in developing Large Language Models (LLMs) using
human feedback to ensure adherence to human values and societal norms.
Dependence on human feedback raises privacy concerns about how much a labeler's
preferences may reveal about their personal values, beliefs, and personality
traits. Existing approaches, such as Differentially Private SGD (DP-SGD),
provide rigorous privacy guarantees by privatizing gradients during fine-tuning
and alignment but can provide more privacy than necessary as human preferences
are tied only to labels of (prompt, response) pairs and can degrade model
utility. This work focuses on LLM alignment with preference-level privacy,
which preserves the privacy of preference labels provided by humans. We propose
PROPS (PROgressively Private Self-alignment), a multi-stage privacy preserving
alignment framework where privately aligned models in previous stages can serve
as labelers for supplementing training data in the subsequent stages of
alignment. We present theoretical guarantees for PROPS as well as comprehensive
validation using multiple models (Pythia and GPT) and datasets (AlpacaEval,
Anthropic HH-RLHF, truthy-dpo-v0.1) to demonstrate the utility of PROPS over
existing methods while still providing high privacy. For the same privacy
budget, alignment via PROPS can achieve up to 3x higher win-rates compared to
DP-SGD, and 2.5x higher win-rates compared to Randomized Response (RR) based
alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维张量数据在自监督学习中面临维度灾难和计算负担问题，现有方法难以有效捕捉非线性关系。

Method: 提出MA-NTAE，结合非线性Tucker分解和递归的unfold-encode-fold操作，实现灵活的模式编码。

Result: MA-NTAE在压缩和聚类任务中优于标准自编码器和现有张量网络，尤其适用于高阶高维张量。

Conclusion: MA-NTAE为高维张量数据提供了一种高效的非线性特征提取方法。

Abstract: High-dimensional data, particularly in the form of high-order tensors,
presents a major challenge in self-supervised learning. While MLP-based
autoencoders (AE) are commonly employed, their dependence on flattening
operations exacerbates the curse of dimensionality, leading to excessively
large model sizes, high computational overhead, and challenging optimization
for deep structural feature capture. Although existing tensor networks
alleviate computational burdens through tensor decomposition techniques, most
exhibit limited capability in learning non-linear relationships. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce the Mode-Aware Non-linear Tucker Autoencoder
(MA-NTAE). MA-NTAE generalized classical Tucker decomposition to a non-linear
framework and employs a Pick-and-Unfold strategy, facilitating flexible
per-mode encoding of high-order tensors via recursive unfold-encode-fold
operations, effectively integrating tensor structural priors. Notably, MA-NTAE
exhibits linear growth in computational complexity with tensor order and
proportional growth with mode dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
MA-NTAE's performance advantages over standard AE and current tensor networks
in compression and clustering tasks, which become increasingly pronounced for
higher-order, higher-dimensional tensors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过重建缺失模态，但未考虑不同样本重建难度的差异，限制了模型对难样本的处理能力。

Method: HARDY-MER分两阶段：1）评估样本难易度（直接和间接难度）；2）动态调整训练课程，平衡难易样本学习。

Result: 在基准数据集上，HARDY-MER在缺失模态场景中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HARDY-MER通过动态课程学习有效提升模型对难样本的处理能力。

Abstract: Missing modalities have recently emerged as a critical research direction in
multimodal emotion recognition (MER). Conventional approaches typically address
this issue through missing modality reconstruction. However, these methods fail
to account for variations in reconstruction difficulty across different
samples, consequently limiting the model's ability to handle hard samples
effectively. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Hardness-Aware
Dynamic Curriculum Learning framework, termed HARDY-MER. Our framework operates
in two key stages: first, it estimates the hardness level of each sample, and
second, it strategically emphasizes hard samples during training to enhance
model performance on these challenging instances. Specifically, we first
introduce a Multi-view Hardness Evaluation mechanism that quantifies
reconstruction difficulty by considering both Direct Hardness (modality
reconstruction errors) and Indirect Hardness (cross-modal mutual information).
Meanwhile, we introduce a Retrieval-based Dynamic Curriculum Learning strategy
that dynamically adjusts the training curriculum by retrieving samples with
similar semantic information and balancing the learning focus between easy and
hard instances. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
HARDY-MER consistently outperforms existing methods in missing-modality
scenarios. Our code will be made publicly available at
https://github.com/HARDY-MER/HARDY-MER.

Motivation: 现有方法生成的离线数据与在线数据存在分布差异，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出Classifier-Free Diffusion Generation (CFDG)，利用无分类器引导扩散提升生成质量，并通过重加权方法使生成数据更符合在线数据分布。

Result: CFDG在D4RL基准测试（如MuJoCo和AntMaze）上实现了15%的平均性能提升。

Conclusion: CFDG是一种通用方法，可与现有离线到在线强化学习算法结合，显著提升性能且保持稳定性。

Abstract: Offline-to-online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL) aims to perform online
fine-tuning on an offline pre-trained policy to minimize costly online
interactions. Existing work used offline datasets to generate data that conform
to the online data distribution for data augmentation. However, generated data
still exhibits a gap with the online data, limiting overall performance. To
address this, we propose a new data augmentation approach, Classifier-Free
Diffusion Generation (CFDG). Without introducing additional classifier training
overhead, CFDG leverages classifier-free guidance diffusion to significantly
enhance the generation quality of offline and online data with different
distributions. Additionally, it employs a reweighting method to enable more
generated data to align with the online data, enhancing performance while
maintaining the agent's stability. Experimental results show that CFDG
outperforms replaying the two data types or using a standard diffusion model to
generate new data. Our method is versatile and can be integrated with existing
offline-to-online RL algorithms. By implementing CFDG to popular methods IQL,
PEX and APL, we achieve a notable 15% average improvement in empirical
performance on the D4RL benchmark such as MuJoCo and AntMaze.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在小众编程语言（如Q语言）和私有领域任务中的不足，提升其在这些领域的性能。

Method: 引入新的Q语言评估数据集，对前沿模型进行基准测试，通过预训练、监督微调和强化学习训练不同规模的模型。

Result: 最佳模型在Q语言基准测试中达到59%的准确率，优于Claude Opus-4和GPT-4.1。

Conclusion: 提出的方法不仅适用于Q语言，还可推广到其他任务，为LLMs在小众领域的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Even though large language models are becoming increasingly capable, it is
still unreasonable to expect them to excel at tasks that are under-represented
on the Internet. Leveraging LLMs for specialized applications, particularly in
niche programming languages and private domains, remains challenging and
largely unsolved. In this work, we address this gap by presenting a
comprehensive, open-source approach for adapting LLMs to the Q programming
language, a popular tool in quantitative finance that is much less present on
the Internet compared to Python, C, Java, and other ``mainstream" languages and
is therefore not a strong suit of general-purpose AI models. We introduce a new
Leetcode style evaluation dataset for Q, benchmark major frontier models on the
dataset, then do pretraining, supervised fine tuning, and reinforcement
learning to train a suite of reasoning and non-reasoning models based on the
Qwen-2.5 series, spanning five parameter sizes (1.5B, 3B, 7B, 14B, 32B). Our
best model achieves a pass@1 accuracy of 59 percent on our Q benchmark,
surpassing the best-performing frontier model, Claude Opus-4 by 29.5 percent.
Additionally, all models, even our 1.5B model, outperform GPT-4.1 on this task.
In addition to releasing models, code, and data, we provide a detailed
blueprint for dataset construction, model pretraining, supervised fine-tuning,
and reinforcement learning. Our methodology is broadly applicable, and we
discuss how these techniques can be extended to other tasks, including those
where evaluation may rely on soft or subjective signals.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测神经网络中的隐藏行为具有挑战性，尤其是缺乏先验知识或存在对抗性混淆时。

Method: 通过对抗游戏框架，红队训练两个模型（良性/有害），蓝队使用多种策略（如高斯噪声分析、模型差异等）识别有害模型。

Result: 基于对抗攻击的方法在提示下准确率达100%，其他方法表现不一；LLM审计需要额外提示。

Conclusion: 对抗攻击方法高效，LLM审计需提示；开源审计工具以促进更好的审计设计。

Abstract: Detecting hidden behaviors in neural networks poses a significant challenge
due to minimal prior knowledge and potential adversarial obfuscation. We
explore this problem by framing detection as an adversarial game between two
teams: the red team trains two similar models, one trained solely on benign
data and the other trained on data containing hidden harmful behavior, with the
performance of both being nearly indistinguishable on the benign dataset. The
blue team, with limited to no information about the harmful behaviour, tries to
identify the compromised model. We experiment using CNNs and try various blue
team strategies, including Gaussian noise analysis, model diffing, integrated
gradients, and adversarial attacks under different levels of hints provided by
the red team. Results show high accuracy for adversarial-attack-based methods
(100\% correct prediction, using hints), which is very promising, whilst the
other techniques yield more varied performance. During our LLM-focused rounds,
we find that there are not many parallel methods that we could apply from our
study with CNNs. Instead, we find that effective LLM auditing methods require
some hints about the undesired distribution, which can then used in standard
black-box and open-weight methods to probe the models further and reveal their
misalignment. We open-source our auditing games (with the model and data) and
hope that our findings contribute to designing better audits.

Motivation: 塑性损失是深度强化学习中的关键挑战，尤其在多任务强化学习中，更高的表征灵活性对处理多样且可能冲突的任务需求至关重要。

Method: 通过系统探索稀疏化方法（GMP和SET）在MTRL中的应用，评估其在共享主干、专家混合和正交专家混合架构上的表现，并与密集基线和其他方法对比。

Conclusion: 动态稀疏化是开发更具适应性MTRL系统的有效工具，但需考虑上下文敏感性。

Abstract: Plasticity loss, a diminishing capacity to adapt as training progresses, is a
critical challenge in deep reinforcement learning. We examine this issue in
multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL), where higher representational
flexibility is crucial for managing diverse and potentially conflicting task
demands. We systematically explore how sparsification methods, particularly
Gradual Magnitude Pruning (GMP) and Sparse Evolutionary Training (SET), enhance
plasticity and consequently improve performance in MTRL agents. We evaluate
these approaches across distinct MTRL architectures (shared backbone, Mixture
of Experts, Mixture of Orthogonal Experts) on standardized MTRL benchmarks,
comparing against dense baselines, and a comprehensive range of alternative
plasticity-inducing or regularization methods. Our results demonstrate that
both GMP and SET effectively mitigate key indicators of plasticity degradation,
such as neuron dormancy and representational collapse. These plasticity
improvements often correlate with enhanced multi-task performance, with sparse
agents frequently outperforming dense counterparts and achieving competitive
results against explicit plasticity interventions. Our findings offer insights
into the interplay between plasticity, network sparsity, and MTRL designs,
highlighting dynamic sparsification as a robust but context-sensitive tool for
developing more adaptable MTRL systems.

Abstract: Conformal predictors are machine learning algorithms developed in the 1990's
by Gammerman, Vovk, and their research team, to provide set predictions with
guaranteed confidence level. Over recent years, they have grown in popularity
and have become a mainstream methodology for uncertainty quantification in the
machine learning community. From its beginning, there was an understanding that
they enable reliable machine learning with well-calibrated uncertainty
quantification. This makes them extremely beneficial for developing trustworthy
AI, a topic that has also risen in interest over the past few years, in both
the AI community and society more widely. In this article, we review the
potential for conformal prediction to contribute to trustworthy AI beyond its
marginal validity property, addressing problems such as generalization risk and
AI governance. Experiments and examples are also provided to demonstrate its
use as a well-calibrated predictor and for bias identification and mitigation.

Conclusion: QuiZSF通过结合RAG和TSPMs，显著提升了零样本时间序列预测的性能和效率。

Abstract: Time series forecasting has become increasingly important to empower diverse
applications with streaming data. Zero-shot time-series forecasting (ZSF),
particularly valuable in data-scarce scenarios, such as domain transfer or
forecasting under extreme conditions, is difficult for traditional models to
deal with. While time series pre-trained models (TSPMs) have demonstrated
strong performance in ZSF, they often lack mechanisms to dynamically
incorporate external knowledge. Fortunately, emerging retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) offers a promising path for injecting such knowledge on
demand, yet they are rarely integrated with TSPMs. To leverage the strengths of
both worlds, we introduce RAG into TSPMs to enhance zero-shot time series
forecasting. In this paper, we propose QuiZSF (Quick Zero-Shot Time Series
Forecaster), a lightweight and modular framework that couples efficient
retrieval with representation learning and model adaptation for ZSF.
Specifically, we construct a hierarchical tree-structured ChronoRAG Base (CRB)
for scalable time-series storage and domain-aware retrieval, introduce a
Multi-grained Series Interaction Learner (MSIL) to extract fine- and
coarse-grained relational features, and develop a dual-branch Model Cooperation
Coherer (MCC) that aligns retrieved knowledge with two kinds of TSPMs: Non-LLM
based and LLM based. Compared with contemporary baselines, QuiZSF, with Non-LLM
based and LLM based TSPMs as base model, respectively, ranks Top1 in 75% and
87.5% of prediction settings, while maintaining high efficiency in memory and
inference time.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了类别特征偏差对模型性能的负面影响，所提方法有效缓解了偏差和不平衡。

Conclusion: 方法同时解决了类别特征偏差和类别不平衡问题，显著提升了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Medical diagnosis might fail due to bias. In this work, we identified
class-feature bias, which refers to models' potential reliance on features that
are strongly correlated with only a subset of classes, leading to biased
performance and poor generalization on other classes. We aim to train a
class-unbiased model (Cls-unbias) that mitigates both class imbalance and
class-feature bias simultaneously. Specifically, we propose a class-wise
inequality loss which promotes equal contributions of classification loss from
positive-class and negative-class samples. We propose to optimize a class-wise
group distributionally robust optimization objective-a class-weighted training
objective that upweights underperforming classes-to enhance the effectiveness
of the inequality loss under class imbalance. Through synthetic and real-world
datasets, we empirically demonstrate that class-feature bias can negatively
impact model performance. Our proposed method effectively mitigates both
class-feature bias and class imbalance, thereby improving the model's
generalization ability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically fine-tuned for reasoning tasks
through a two-stage pipeline of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by
Reinforcement Learning (RL), a process fraught with catastrophic forgetting and
suboptimal trade-offs between imitation and exploration. Recent single-stage
methods attempt to unify SFT and RL using heuristics, but lack a principled
mechanism for dynamically balancing the two paradigms. In this paper, we
reframe this challenge through the theoretical lens of \textbf{implicit
rewards}, viewing SFT and RL not as distinct methods but as complementary
reward signals. We introduce \textbf{Adaptive Meta Fine-Tuning (AMFT)}, a novel
single-stage algorithm that learns the optimal balance between SFT's implicit,
path-level reward and RL's explicit, outcome-based reward. The core of AMFT is
a \textbf{meta-gradient adaptive weight controller} that treats the SFT-RL
balance as a learnable parameter, dynamically optimizing it to maximize
long-term task performance. This forward-looking approach, regularized by
policy entropy for stability, autonomously discovers an effective training
curriculum. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on challenging benchmarks
spanning mathematical reasoning, abstract visual reasoning (General Points),
and vision-language navigation (V-IRL). AMFT consistently establishes a new
state-of-the-art and demonstrats superior generalization on out-of-distribution
(OOD) tasks. Ablation studies and training dynamic analysis confirm that the
meta-learning controller is crucial for AMFT's stability, sample efficiency,
and performance, offering a more principled and effective paradigm for LLM
alignment.Our codes are open-sourced via https://github.com/hlxtsyj/AMFT.

TL;DR: BoRA是一种改进LoRA的方法，通过块矩阵乘法和引入对角矩阵，以少量额外参数提升LoRA权重矩阵的秩，从而提高微调性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在大型语言模型微调中表现高效，但增加秩会显著增加参数数量。BoRA旨在以更少的额外参数提升秩，优化性能。

Method: BoRA将LoRA的权重矩阵分解为块矩阵，并引入块对角矩阵，通过块乘法提升秩，仅需少量额外参数。

Result: 实验证明BoRA在多个数据集和模型上优于LoRA，且具有可扩展性。

Conclusion: BoRA通过块多样化和少量额外参数，显著提升了LoRA的性能和效率。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
widely used in large language models (LLMs). It approximates the update of a
pretrained weight matrix $W\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ by the product of two
low-rank matrices, $BA$, where $A \in\mathbb{R}^{r\times n}$ and
$B\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times r} (r\ll\min\{m,n\})$. Increasing the dimension $r$
can raise the rank of LoRA weights (i.e., $BA$), which typically improves
fine-tuning performance but also significantly increases the number of
trainable parameters. In this paper, we propose Block Diversified Low-Rank
Adaptation (BoRA), which improves the rank of LoRA weights with a small number
of additional parameters. Specifically, BoRA treats the product $BA$ as a block
matrix multiplication, where $A$ and $B$ are partitioned into $b$ blocks along
the columns and rows, respectively (i.e., $A=[A_1,\dots,A_b]$ and
$B=[B_1,\dots,B_b]^\top$). Consequently, the product $BA$ becomes the
concatenation of the block products $B_iA_j$ for $i,j\in[b]$. To enhance the
diversity of different block products, BoRA introduces a unique diagonal matrix
$\Sigma_{i,j} \in \mathbb{R}^{r\times r}$ for each block multiplication,
resulting in $B_i \Sigma_{i,j} A_j$. By leveraging these block-wise diagonal
matrices, BoRA increases the rank of LoRA weights by a factor of $b$ while only
requiring $b^2r$ additional parameters. Extensive experiments across multiple
datasets and models demonstrate the superiority of BoRA, and ablation studies
further validate its scalability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态学习网络复杂性与可解释性之间的矛盾。

Method: 将某些模态作为附加目标与主任务一起预测，而非额外输入。

Result: 在数据稀缺时无需收集额外模态，性能与基线相当或更优，主任务误差可通过辅助任务解释。

Conclusion: 多任务学习在卫星数据处理中高效且可解释。

Abstract: Remote sensing provides satellite data in diverse types and formats. The
usage of multimodal learning networks exploits this diversity to improve model
performance, except that the complexity of such networks comes at the expense
of their interpretability. In this study, we explore how modalities can be
leveraged through multitask learning to intrinsically explain model behavior.
In particular, instead of additional inputs, we use certain modalities as
additional targets to be predicted along with the main task. The success of
this approach relies on the rich information content of satellite data, which
remains as input modalities. We show how this modeling context provides
numerous benefits: (1) in case of data scarcity, the additional modalities do
not need to be collected for model inference at deployment, (2) the model
performance remains comparable to the multimodal baseline performance, and in
some cases achieves better scores, (3) prediction errors in the main task can
be explained via the model behavior in the auxiliary task(s). We demonstrate
the efficiency of our approach on three datasets, including segmentation,
classification, and regression tasks. Code available at

Motivation: 解决数据稀疏或优化误差下数字孪生的数值稳定性和守恒量精确保持问题。

Method: 采用有限元外微积分（FEEC）框架，结合条件注意力机制学习降阶基和守恒律，支持非侵入式与传统有限元方法集成。

Result: 在复杂几何和稀疏数据（25次LES模拟）下实现准确预测，实时推理速度提升3.1x10^8倍。

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂问题中表现优异，支持实时数字孪生构建，并开源实现。

Abstract: We present a framework for constructing real-time digital twins based on
structure-preserving reduced finite element models conditioned on a latent
variable Z. The approach uses conditional attention mechanisms to learn both a
reduced finite element basis and a nonlinear conservation law within the
framework of finite element exterior calculus (FEEC). This guarantees numerical
well-posedness and exact preservation of conserved quantities, regardless of
data sparsity or optimization error. The conditioning mechanism supports
real-time calibration to parametric variables, allowing the construction of
digital twins which support closed loop inference and calibration to sensor
data. The framework interfaces with conventional finite element machinery in a
non-invasive manner, allowing treatment of complex geometries and integration
of learned models with conventional finite element techniques.
  Benchmarks include advection diffusion, shock hydrodynamics, electrostatics,
and a complex battery thermal runaway problem. The method achieves accurate
predictions on complex geometries with sparse data (25 LES simulations),
including capturing the transition to turbulence and achieving real-time
inference ~0.1s with a speedup of 3.1x10^8 relative to LES. An open-source
implementation is available on GitHub.

Motivation: 电池研发因高时间和能源成本的验证过程而受限，现有数据驱动方法需目标设计的标记数据且效率不足。

Method: DL整合主动学习、物理引导学习和零样本学习，利用历史电池设计数据，减少原型需求。

Result: 在123个工业级锂离子电池上测试，DL仅使用公开数据集即实现7.2%的测试误差，节省98%时间和95%能源。

Conclusion: DL为高效数据驱动建模提供了关键进展，有望加速科学发现和工程创新。

Abstract: Fast and reliable validation of novel designs in complex physical systems
such as batteries is critical to accelerating technological innovation.
However, battery research and development remain bottlenecked by the
prohibitively high time and energy costs required to evaluate numerous new
design candidates, particularly in battery prototyping and life testing.
Despite recent progress in data-driven battery lifetime prediction, existing
methods require labeled data of target designs to improve accuracy and cannot
make reliable predictions until after prototyping, thus falling far short of
the efficiency needed to enable rapid feedback for battery design. Here, we
introduce Discovery Learning (DL), a scientific machine-learning paradigm that
integrates active learning, physics-guided learning, and zero-shot learning
into a human-like reasoning loop, drawing inspiration from learning theories in
educational psychology. DL can learn from historical battery designs and
actively reduce the need for prototyping, thus enabling rapid lifetime
evaluation for unobserved material-design combinations without requiring
additional data labeling. To test DL, we present 123 industrial-grade
large-format lithium-ion pouch cells, spanning eight material-design
combinations and diverse cycling protocols. Trained solely on public datasets
of small-capacity cylindrical cells, DL achieves 7.2% test error in predicting
the average cycle life under unknown device variability. This results in
savings of 98% in time and 95% in energy compared to industrial practices. This
work highlights the potential of uncovering insights from historical designs to
inform and accelerate the development of next-generation battery technologies.
DL represents a key advance toward efficient data-driven modeling and helps
realize the promise of machine learning for accelerating scientific discovery
and engineering innovation.

Result: 在多城市数据集上，UniMove通过联合训练提升预测准确性10.2%，成为统一基础模型的关键进展。

Conclusion: UniMove通过统一架构和跨城市数据增强，为人类移动预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Human mobility prediction is vital for urban planning, transportation
optimization, and personalized services. However, the inherent randomness,
non-uniform time intervals, and complex patterns of human mobility, compounded
by the heterogeneity introduced by varying city structures, infrastructure, and
population densities, present significant challenges in modeling. Existing
solutions often require training separate models for each city due to distinct
spatial representations and geographic coverage. In this paper, we propose
UniMove, a unified model for multi-city human mobility prediction, addressing
two challenges: (1) constructing universal spatial representations for
effective token sharing across cities, and (2) modeling heterogeneous mobility
patterns from varying city characteristics. We propose a trajectory-location
dual-tower architecture, with a location tower for universal spatial encoding
and a trajectory tower for sequential mobility modeling. We also design MoE
Transformer blocks to adaptively select experts to handle diverse movement
patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets from diverse cities
demonstrate that UniMove truly embodies the essence of a unified model. By
enabling joint training on multi-city data with mutual data enhancement, it
significantly improves mobility prediction accuracy by over 10.2\%. UniMove
represents a key advancement toward realizing a true foundational model with a
unified architecture for human mobility. We release the implementation at

Motivation: TM缺乏特征重要性评估工具，而FS对提升模型解释性和准确性至关重要。

Method: 研究采用了多种FS技术，包括传统过滤和嵌入方法，以及SHAP、LIME等后解释方法，并提出了一种新的基于TM内部评分的FS方法。

Result: TM内部评分方法不仅性能优异，还能利用TM的解释性揭示特征交互模式，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 该研究为TM中的FS建立了首个全面基线，为开发专用解释技术奠定了基础。

Abstract: Feature Selection (FS) is crucial for improving model interpretability,
reducing complexity, and sometimes for enhancing accuracy. The recently
introduced Tsetlin machine (TM) offers interpretable clause-based learning, but
lacks established tools for estimating feature importance. In this paper, we
adapt and evaluate a range of FS techniques for TMs, including classical filter
and embedded methods as well as post-hoc explanation methods originally
developed for neural networks (e.g., SHAP and LIME) and a novel family of
embedded scorers derived from TM clause weights and Tsetlin automaton (TA)
states. We benchmark all methods across 12 datasets, using evaluation
protocols, like Remove and Retrain (ROAR) strategy and Remove and Debias
(ROAD), to assess causal impact. Our results show that TM-internal scorers not
only perform competitively but also exploit the interpretability of clauses to
reveal interacting feature patterns. Simpler TM-specific scorers achieve
similar accuracy retention at a fraction of the computational cost. This study
establishes the first comprehensive baseline for FS in TM and paves the way for
developing specialized TM-specific interpretability techniques.

Method: 提出一种贪婪算法，利用共形预测集选择实例相关的专家子集，对比了传统方法。

Result: 在CIFAR-10H和ImageNet-16H数据集上的模拟实验表明，贪婪算法能接近最优子集，提升分类性能。

Conclusion: 多专家协作中，实例特定的专家子集选择能显著提升分类性能，贪婪算法是一种有效方法。

Abstract: Decision support systems are designed to assist human experts in
classification tasks by providing conformal prediction sets derived from a
pre-trained model. This human-AI collaboration has demonstrated enhanced
classification performance compared to using either the model or the expert
independently. In this study, we focus on the selection of instance-specific
experts from a pool of multiple human experts, contrasting it with existing
research that typically focuses on single-expert scenarios. We characterize the
conditions under which multiple experts can benefit from the conformal sets.
With the insight that only certain experts may be relevant for each instance,
we explore the problem of subset selection and introduce a greedy algorithm
that utilizes conformal sets to identify the subset of expert predictions that
will be used in classifying an instance. This approach is shown to yield better
performance compared to naive methods for human subset selection. Based on real
expert predictions from the CIFAR-10H and ImageNet-16H datasets, our simulation
study indicates that our proposed greedy algorithm achieves near-optimal
subsets, resulting in improved classification performance among multiple
experts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型常忽略时滞交叉相关性，而这对捕捉复杂时间关系至关重要。

Method: 提出TLCCSP框架，结合SSDTW算法和对比学习编码器（CLE）来捕捉时滞相关性并优化计算。

Result: 在天气、金融和房地产数据集上，SSDTW和CLE显著降低MSE（最高21.29%），且CLE减少计算时间约99%。

Conclusion: TLCCSP框架有效提升预测准确性并确保实时适用性，适用于多领域时间序列预测。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is critical across various domains, such as weather,
finance and real estate forecasting, as accurate forecasts support informed
decision-making and risk mitigation. While recent deep learning models have
improved predictive capabilities, they often overlook time-lagged
cross-correlations between related sequences, which are crucial for capturing
complex temporal relationships. To address this, we propose the Time-Lagged
Cross-Correlations-based Sequence Prediction framework (TLCCSP), which enhances
forecasting accuracy by effectively integrating time-lagged cross-correlated
sequences. TLCCSP employs the Sequence Shifted Dynamic Time Warping (SSDTW)
algorithm to capture lagged correlations and a contrastive learning-based
encoder to efficiently approximate SSDTW distances.
  Experimental results on weather, finance and real estate time series datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. On the weather dataset, SSDTW
reduces mean squared error (MSE) by 16.01% compared with single-sequence
methods, while the contrastive learning encoder (CLE) further decreases MSE by
17.88%. On the stock dataset, SSDTW achieves a 9.95% MSE reduction, and CLE
reduces it by 6.13%. For the real estate dataset, SSDTW and CLE reduce MSE by
21.29% and 8.62%, respectively. Additionally, the contrastive learning approach
decreases SSDTW computational time by approximately 99%, ensuring scalability
and real-time applicability across multiple time series forecasting tasks.

Result: 在Waymo数据集上，CQL策略的成功率比最强BC基线高3.2倍，碰撞率低7.4倍。

Conclusion: 离线强化学习方法对于从静态数据中学习鲁棒、长时程驾驶策略至关重要。

Abstract: Learning robust driving policies from large-scale, real-world datasets is a
central challenge in autonomous driving, as online data collection is often
unsafe and impractical. While Behavioral Cloning (BC) offers a straightforward
approach to imitation learning, policies trained with BC are notoriously
brittle and suffer from compounding errors in closed-loop execution. This work
presents a comprehensive pipeline and a comparative study to address this
limitation. We first develop a series of increasingly sophisticated BC
baselines, culminating in a Transformer-based model that operates on a
structured, entity-centric state representation. While this model achieves low
imitation loss, we show that it still fails in long-horizon simulations. We
then demonstrate that by applying a state-of-the-art Offline Reinforcement
Learning algorithm, Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), to the same data and
architecture, we can learn a significantly more robust policy. Using a
carefully engineered reward function, the CQL agent learns a conservative value
function that enables it to recover from minor errors and avoid
out-of-distribution states. In a large-scale evaluation on 1,000 unseen
scenarios from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, our final CQL agent achieves a
3.2x higher success rate and a 7.4x lower collision rate than the strongest BC
baseline, proving that an offline RL approach is critical for learning robust,
long-horizon driving policies from static expert data.

Motivation: 神经退行性疾病的进展通常被建模为时空扩散过程，但由于纵向数据稀缺和病理机制的复杂性，传统模型难以准确描述其动态变化。

Method: 提出IGND-MoE框架，结合时间依赖的专家权重、双优化方法估计时间位置、非均匀图神经扩散模型（IGND）和局部神经反应模块。

Result: 模型揭示了不同疾病阶段的主导机制，早期以图相关过程为主，后期其他未知物理过程更显著。

Conclusion: IGND-MoE为理解神经退行性疾病的阶段特异性机制提供了新方法，具有临床意义。

Abstract: The long-term progression of neurodegenerative diseases is commonly
conceptualized as a spatiotemporal diffusion process that consists of a graph
diffusion process across the structural brain connectome and a localized
reaction process within brain regions. However, modeling this progression
remains challenging due to 1) the scarcity of longitudinal data obtained
through irregular and infrequent subject visits and 2) the complex interplay of
pathological mechanisms across brain regions and disease stages, where
traditional models assume fixed mechanisms throughout disease progression. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel stage-aware Mixture of Experts
(MoE) framework that explicitly models how different contributing mechanisms
dominate at different disease stages through time-dependent expert
weighting.Data-wise, we utilize an iterative dual optimization method to
properly estimate the temporal position of individual observations,
constructing a co hort-level progression trajectory from irregular snapshots.
Model-wise, we enhance the spatial component with an inhomogeneous graph neural
diffusion model (IGND) that allows diffusivity to vary based on node states and
time, providing more flexible representations of brain networks. We also
introduce a localized neural reaction module to capture complex dynamics beyond
standard processes.The resulting IGND-MoE model dynamically integrates these
components across temporal states, offering a principled way to understand how
stage-specific pathological mechanisms contribute to progression. The
stage-wise weights yield novel clinical insights that align with literature,
suggesting that graph-related processes are more influential at early stages,
while other unknown physical processes become dominant later on.

Result: 在合成和真实NCLT数据集上验证了OTAKNet的性能，尤其在训练数据有限时表现优异。

Conclusion: OTAKNet是首个在线解决噪声统计漂移的学习型方法，优于传统模型和离线学习型方法。

Abstract: Learning-based filtering has demonstrated strong performance in non-linear
dynamical systems, particularly when the statistics of noise are unknown.
However, in real-world deployments, environmental factors, such as changing
wind conditions or electromagnetic interference, can induce unobserved
noise-statistics drift, leading to substantial degradation of learning-based
methods. To address this challenge, we propose OTAKNet, the first online
solution to noise-statistics drift within learning-based adaptive Kalman
filtering. Unlike existing learning-based methods that perform offline
fine-tuning using batch pointwise matching over entire trajectories, OTAKNet
establishes a connection between the state estimate and the drift via one-step
predictive measurement likelihood, and addresses it using optimal transport.
This leverages OT's geometry - aware cost and stable gradients to enable fully
online adaptation without ground truth labels or retraining. We compare OTAKNet
against classical model-based adaptive Kalman filtering and offline
learning-based filtering. The performance is demonstrated on both synthetic and
real-world NCLT datasets, particularly under limited training data.

Motivation: 解决知识蒸馏中学生模型可能继承教师模型隐私的问题，尤其是在教师模型基于私有数据训练时。

Method: 通过指令调优设置覆盖七个NLP任务，使用三种教师模型家族（GPT-2、LLAMA-2、OPT）和不同规模的学生模型，分析六种KD技术的隐私风险。

Result: 所有KD方法均存在隐私风险，但程度不同；记忆与成员隐私风险之间存在显著不一致；不同模块的隐私风险差异较大。

Conclusion: KD技术需谨慎设计以降低隐私风险，未来研究应关注隐私保护机制。

Abstract: Recent advances in Knowledge Distillation (KD) aim to mitigate the high
computational demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) by transferring knowledge
from a large ''teacher'' to a smaller ''student'' model. However, students may
inherit the teacher's privacy when the teacher is trained on private data. In
this work, we systematically characterize and investigate membership and
memorization privacy risks inherent in six LLM KD techniques. Using
instruction-tuning settings that span seven NLP tasks, together with three
teacher model families (GPT-2, LLAMA-2, and OPT), and various size student
models, we demonstrate that all existing LLM KD approaches carry membership and
memorization privacy risks from the teacher to its students. However, the
extent of privacy risks varies across different KD techniques. We
systematically analyse how key LLM KD components (KD objective functions,
student training data and NLP tasks) impact such privacy risks. We also
demonstrate a significant disagreement between memorization and membership
privacy risks of LLM KD techniques. Finally, we characterize per-block privacy
risk and demonstrate that the privacy risk varies across different blocks by a
large margin.

Motivation: LLMs在动态知识更新中面临新知识与旧知识冲突的问题，导致模型难以接受新知识或遗忘无关知识。

Method: 采用两阶段策略：1）定位冲突知识编码的内部组件；2）通过$IA^3$技术进行参数高效微调。

Result: 实验显示，新策略在新知识准确率（98.50%）和旧知识遗忘率（96.00%）上表现优异，同时显著减轻了灾难性遗忘问题。

Conclusion: 该方法为紧凑型LLMs提供了精确、局部化且安全的知识管理方案，具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with dynamic knowledge updates,
especially when new information conflicts with deeply embedded facts. Such
conflicting factual edits often lead to two critical issues: resistance to
adopting the new fact and severe catastrophic forgetting of unrelated
knowledge. This paper introduces and evaluates a novel "unlearn-then-learn"
strategy for precise knowledge editing in LLMs, leveraging the
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) technique, Infused Adapter by Inhibiting
and Amplifying Inner Activations ($IA^3$). Crucially, this two-stage approach
is powered by an initial circuit localization phase that identifies and targets
the specific internal components responsible for encoding the conflicting fact.
Through a rigorous experimental methodology on
microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct, we demonstrate that this mechanistically
informed two-stage approach achieves near-perfect accuracy (98.50%) for the
new, modulated fact while simultaneously effectively suppressing the original
conflicting fact (96.00% forget rate). Critically, our strategy exhibits
unprecedented localization (72.00% F_control accuracy), dramatically mitigating
catastrophic forgetting observed in direct fine-tuning approaches (which showed
as low as ~20% F_control accuracy), a direct benefit of our targeted
interpretability-guided intervention. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals
a nuanced mechanism of "soft forgetting," where original knowledge is
suppressed from default retrieval but remains latent and conditionally
accessible, enhancing model safety and control. These findings represent a
significant advancement towards precise, localized, and safe knowledge
management in compact LLMs.

synthetic drift, our proposed model allows for a better detection of drift
using as a whole and at different detection thresholds for both sensitivity and
interpretability compared to baseline methods and provides a strong pipeline
for drift detection in real time for applied machine learning. We evaluated
performance using a time-sequenced airline passenger dataset having the
gradually injected stimulus of drift in expectations,e.g. permuted ticket
prices in later batches, broken into 10 time segments [1].In the data, our
results support that the Transformation-Autoencoder detected drift earlier and
with more sensitivity than the autoencoders commonly used in the literature,
and provided improved modeling over more error rates and logical violations.
Therefore, a robust framework was developed to reliably monitor concept drift.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Second-Order MeanFlow的新方法，通过引入平均加速度场扩展了MeanFlow框架，证明了其可行性和高效性，并提供了理论支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成建模领域在无模拟范式（如Flow Matching和MeanFlow）中取得了显著进展，但高动态性和高效采样的结合仍需进一步研究。

Method: 提出Second-Order MeanFlow，将平均加速度场纳入MeanFlow目标，证明其满足一致性条件，并通过电路复杂性分析表征其表达能力。

Result: 证明了Second-Order MeanFlow可实现高效单步采样，其采样过程可在$\mathsf{TC}^0$类中实现，且注意力计算可高效近似。

Conclusion: 研究为高动态性与高效采样结合的高阶流匹配模型奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: Generative modelling has seen significant advances through simulation-free
paradigms such as Flow Matching, and in particular, the MeanFlow framework,
which replaces instantaneous velocity fields with average velocities to enable
efficient single-step sampling. In this work, we introduce a theoretical study
on Second-Order MeanFlow, a novel extension that incorporates average
acceleration fields into the MeanFlow objective. We first establish the
feasibility of our approach by proving that the average acceleration satisfies
a generalized consistency condition analogous to first-order MeanFlow, thereby
supporting stable, one-step sampling and tractable loss functions. We then
characterize its expressivity via circuit complexity analysis, showing that
under mild assumptions, the Second-Order MeanFlow sampling process can be
implemented by uniform threshold circuits within the $\mathsf{TC}^0$ class.
Finally, we derive provably efficient criteria for scalable implementation by
leveraging fast approximate attention computations: we prove that attention
operations within the Second-Order MeanFlow architecture can be approximated to
within $1/\mathrm{poly}(n)$ error in time $n^{2+o(1)}$. Together, these results
lay the theoretical foundation for high-order flow matching models that combine
rich dynamics with practical sampling efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出BrainATCL框架，用于动态fMRI数据的自适应时间脑连接学习，解决了传统GNN在捕捉长时依赖上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: fMRI信号的功能连接动态与行为和神经精神疾病相关，但传统GNN难以捕捉长时依赖。

Method: 提出BrainATCL框架，动态调整回溯窗口，结合GINE-Mamba2编码图序列，并融入脑结构和功能信息。

Result: 在功能连接预测和年龄估计任务中表现优异，具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: BrainATCL为动态fMRI数据分析提供了有效工具，尤其在捕捉生物拓扑模式上表现突出。

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an imaging technique widely
used to study human brain activity. fMRI signals in areas across the brain
transiently synchronise and desynchronise their activity in a highly structured
manner, even when an individual is at rest. These functional connectivity
dynamics may be related to behaviour and neuropsychiatric disease. To model
these dynamics, temporal brain connectivity representations are essential, as
they reflect evolving interactions between brain regions and provide insight
into transient neural states and network reconfigurations. However,
conventional graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle to capture long-range
temporal dependencies in dynamic fMRI data. To address this challenge, we
propose BrainATCL, an unsupervised, nonparametric framework for adaptive
temporal brain connectivity learning, enabling functional link prediction and
age estimation. Our method dynamically adjusts the lookback window for each
snapshot based on the rate of newly added edges. Graph sequences are
subsequently encoded using a GINE-Mamba2 backbone to learn spatial-temporal
representations of dynamic functional connectivity in resting-state fMRI data
of 1,000 participants from the Human Connectome Project. To further improve
spatial modeling, we incorporate brain structure and function-informed edge
attributes, i.e., the left/right hemispheric identity and subnetwork membership
of brain regions, enabling the model to capture biologically meaningful
topological patterns. We evaluate our BrainATCL on two tasks: functional link
prediction and age estimation. The experimental results demonstrate superior
performance and strong generalization, including in cross-session prediction
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有分类器在极端情况下预测准确性不足的问题，并系统性地减少预测误差。

Method: 采用多实例学习（MIL）方法，通过数学分析证明其优于单实例学习，并通过实例数量扩展行为验证理论。

Result: 在标准模型有效场论（SMEFT）的约束下，展示了从LHC数据中提取最大Fisher信息的可能性。

Conclusion: 多实例学习方法在提高预测精度和判别能力方面具有潜力，尤其在复杂物理问题中表现突出。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a new machine learning (ML) methodology to obtain
more precise predictions for some parameters of interest in a given hypotheses
testing problem. Our proposed method also allows ML models to have more
discriminative power in cases where it is extremely challenging for
state-of-the-art classifiers to have any level of accurate predictions. This
method can also allow us to systematically decrease the error from ML models in
their predictions. In this paper, we provide a mathematical motivation why
Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) would have more predictive power over their
single-instance counterparts. We support our theoretical claims by analyzing
the behavior of the MIL models through their scaling behaviors with respect to
the number of instances on which the model makes predictions. As a concrete
application, we constrain Wilson coefficients of the Standard Model Effective
Field Theory (SMEFT) using kinematic information from subatomic particle
collision events at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We show that under certain
circumstances, it might be possible to extract the theoretical maximum Fisher
Information latent in a dataset.

TL;DR: LOGIC是一个轻量级框架，利用大语言模型（LLM）为GNN预测生成可解释的解释，通过将GNN嵌入投影到LLM空间并结合混合提示，提高了解释的忠实性和可读性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN在结构化数据学习中表现强大，但缺乏可解释性，现有方法难以生成细粒度解释，尤其是当节点属性包含丰富自然语言时。

Method: LOGIC将GNN节点嵌入投影到LLM嵌入空间，构建混合提示（软提示与文本输入结合），使LLM能推理GNN内部表示并生成自然语言解释和子图。

Result: 在四个真实TAG数据集上的实验表明，LOGIC在忠实性和稀疏性之间取得平衡，并显著提升人类中心指标（如洞察力）。

Conclusion: LOGIC为基于LLM的图学习可解释性开辟了新方向，通过将GNN内部表示与人类推理对齐。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning over
structured data, including text-attributed graphs, which are common in domains
such as citation networks, social platforms, and knowledge graphs. GNNs are not
inherently interpretable and thus, many explanation methods have been proposed.
However, existing explanation methods often struggle to generate interpretable,
fine-grained rationales, especially when node attributes include rich natural
language. In this work, we introduce LOGIC, a lightweight, post-hoc framework
that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate faithful and interpretable
explanations for GNN predictions. LOGIC projects GNN node embeddings into the
LLM embedding space and constructs hybrid prompts that interleave soft prompts
with textual inputs from the graph structure. This enables the LLM to reason
about GNN internal representations and produce natural language explanations
along with concise explanation subgraphs. Our experiments across four
real-world TAG datasets demonstrate that LOGIC achieves a favorable trade-off
between fidelity and sparsity, while significantly improving human-centric
metrics such as insightfulness. LOGIC sets a new direction for LLM-based
explainability in graph learning by aligning GNN internals with human
reasoning.

Motivation: 解决多级服务调用结构的分布式后端系统性能波动预测问题。

Method: 将系统状态抽象为图结构序列，结合运行时特征和调用关系，使用图卷积网络和高门限循环网络进行建模。

Result: 在MAE、RMSE和R2等关键指标上优于现有方法，具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该模型在后端服务性能管理任务中具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper proposes a spatiotemporal graph neural network-based performance
prediction algorithm to address the challenge of forecasting performance
fluctuations in distributed backend systems with multi-level service call
structures. The method abstracts system states at different time slices into a
sequence of graph structures. It integrates the runtime features of service
nodes with the invocation relationships among services to construct a unified
spatiotemporal modeling framework. The model first applies a graph
convolutional network to extract high-order dependency information from the
service topology. Then it uses a gated recurrent network to capture the dynamic
evolution of performance metrics over time. A time encoding mechanism is also
introduced to enhance the model's ability to represent non-stationary temporal
sequences. The architecture is trained in an end-to-end manner, optimizing the
multi-layer nested structure to achieve high-precision regression of future
service performance metrics. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed
method, a large-scale public cluster dataset is used. A series of
multi-dimensional experiments are designed, including variations in time
windows and concurrent load levels. These experiments comprehensively evaluate
the model's predictive performance and stability. The experimental results show
that the proposed model outperforms existing representative methods across key
metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R2. It maintains strong robustness under varying
load intensities and structural complexities. These results demonstrate the
model's practical potential for backend service performance management tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在在线强化学习中，任务目标难以通过密集奖励函数明确，且标量反馈存在噪声和不一致性，限制了奖励模型的准确性和泛化能力。

Method: Pref-GUIDE通过将标量反馈转化为偏好数据，利用短时间窗口比较行为并过滤模糊反馈（Individual），同时通过用户群体投票形成共识偏好（Voting）。

Result: 在三个挑战性环境中，Pref-GUIDE显著优于标量反馈基线，投票变体甚至超过专家设计的密集奖励。

Conclusion: Pref-GUIDE通过结构化偏好和群体反馈，为在线强化学习中利用人类输入提供了可扩展且原则性的方法。

Abstract: Training reinforcement learning agents with human feedback is crucial when
task objectives are difficult to specify through dense reward functions. While
prior methods rely on offline trajectory comparisons to elicit human
preferences, such data is unavailable in online learning scenarios where agents
must adapt on the fly. Recent approaches address this by collecting real-time
scalar feedback to guide agent behavior and train reward models for continued
learning after human feedback becomes unavailable. However, scalar feedback is
often noisy and inconsistent, limiting the accuracy and generalization of
learned rewards. We propose Pref-GUIDE, a framework that transforms real-time
scalar feedback into preference-based data to improve reward model learning for
continual policy training. Pref-GUIDE Individual mitigates temporal
inconsistency by comparing agent behaviors within short windows and filtering
ambiguous feedback. Pref-GUIDE Voting further enhances robustness by
aggregating reward models across a population of users to form consensus
preferences. Across three challenging environments, Pref-GUIDE significantly
outperforms scalar-feedback baselines, with the voting variant exceeding even
expert-designed dense rewards. By reframing scalar feedback as structured
preferences with population feedback, Pref-GUIDE offers a scalable and
principled approach for harnessing human input in online reinforcement
learning.

Conclusion: LLMs在心血管疾病预测和个性化医疗中展现出重要潜力，有望推动心脏护理的进步。

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction remains a tremendous challenge due to
its multifactorial etiology and global burden of morbidity and mortality.
Despite the growing availability of genomic and electrophysiological data,
extracting biologically meaningful insights from such high-dimensional, noisy,
and sparsely annotated datasets remains a non-trivial task. Recently, LLMs has
been applied effectively to predict structural variations in biological
sequences. In this work, we explore the potential of fine-tuned LLMs to predict
cardiac diseases and SNPs potentially leading to CVD risk using genetic markers
derived from high-throughput genomic profiling. We investigate the effect of
genetic patterns associated with cardiac conditions and evaluate how LLMs can
learn latent biological relationships from structured and semi-structured
genomic data obtained by mapping genetic aspects that are inherited from the
family tree. By framing the problem as a Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning task,
the models are prompted to generate disease labels and articulate informed
clinical deductions across diverse patient profiles and phenotypes. The
findings highlight the promise of LLMs in contributing to early detection, risk
assessment, and ultimately, the advancement of personalized medicine in cardiac
care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半NMF算法多为迭代、非凸且易陷入局部最优，需改进以实现全局最优。

Method: 基于输入数据的散布矩阵进行正交分解，获得Frobenius范数下的全局最优解。

Result: 在合成数据和UCI Wine数据集上验证，重建误差更低，优于现有NMF和半NMF方法。

Conclusion: 新方法提供了理论保证和实际优势，为矩阵分解优化提供了新视角。

Abstract: Semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (semi-NMF) extends classical
Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) by allowing the basis matrix to contain
both positive and negative entries, making it suitable for decomposing data
with mixed signs. However, most existing semi-NMF algorithms are iterative,
non-convex, and prone to local minima. In this paper, we propose a novel method
that yields a globally optimal solution to the semi-NMF problem under the
Frobenius norm, through an orthogonal decomposition derived from the scatter
matrix of the input data. We rigorously prove that our solution attains the
global minimum of the reconstruction error. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
when the input matrix is nonnegative, our method often achieves lower
reconstruction error than standard NMF algorithms, although unfortunately the
basis matrix may not satisfy nonnegativity. In particular, in low-rank cases
such as rank 1 or 2, our solution reduces exactly to a nonnegative
factorization, recovering the NMF structure. We validate our approach through
experiments on both synthetic data and the UCI Wine dataset, showing that our
method consistently outperforms existing NMF and semi-NMF methods in terms of
reconstruction accuracy. These results confirm that our globally optimal,
non-iterative formulation offers both theoretical guarantees and empirical
advantages, providing a new perspective on matrix factorization in optimization
and data analysis.

Motivation: DPO损失函数在理论上与推导不一致，可能导致训练不稳定和奖励攻击，需要一种更稳定的替代方案。

Method: 提出了一种新的损失函数，直接基于RLHF最优条件，目标是设定一个有限的logits差值，而非最大化。

Result: 实验验证了新方法在Qwen2.5-7B模型上的有效性，显著优于标准DPO基线，并与更大模型竞争。

Conclusion: 新方法在理论和实验上均优于DPO，提供了更稳定的对齐方案。

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is
commonly achieved through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) simplified this paradigm by establishing a
direct mapping between the optimal policy and a reward function, eliminating
the need for an explicit reward model. However, we argue that the DPO loss
function is theoretically misaligned with its own derivation, as it promotes
the indefinite maximization of a logits difference, which can lead to training
instability and reward hacking. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function
derived directly from the RLHF optimality condition. Our proposed loss targets
a specific, finite value for the logits difference, which is dictated by the
underlying reward, rather than its maximization. We provide a theoretical
analysis, including a gradient-based comparison, to demonstrate that our method
avoids the large gradients that plague DPO when the probability of dispreferred
responses approaches zero. This inherent stability prevents reward hacking and
leads to more effective alignment. We validate our approach by fine-tuning a
Qwen2.5-7B model, showing significant win-rate improvements over a standard DPO
baseline and achieving competitive performance against larger models like
Llama-3.1-8B.

Result: 通过博弈分析，实现了隐私保护与模型准确性的平衡，实验验证了参数的影响。

Conclusion: 代币激励机制有效平衡了联邦学习中的隐私与准确性，博弈论方法为优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: In Federated Learning (FL), multiple clients jointly train a machine learning
model by sharing gradient information, instead of raw data, with a server over
multiple rounds. To address the possibility of information leakage in spite of
sharing only the gradients, Local Differential Privacy (LDP) is often used. In
LDP, clients add a selective amount of noise to the gradients before sending
the same to the server. Although such noise addition protects the privacy of
clients, it leads to a degradation in global model accuracy. In this paper, we
model this privacy-accuracy trade-off as a game, where the sever incentivizes
the clients to add a lower degree of noise for achieving higher accuracy, while
the clients attempt to preserve their privacy at the cost of a potential loss
in accuracy. A token based incentivization mechanism is introduced in which the
quantum of tokens credited to a client in an FL round is a function of the
degree of perturbation of its gradients. The client can later access a newly
updated global model only after acquiring enough tokens, which are to be
deducted from its balance. We identify the players, their actions and payoff,
and perform a strategic analysis of the game. Extensive experiments were
carried out to study the impact of different parameters.

Result: 低精度SGD仍收敛，但速度减慢（由最小收缩因子决定），且量化噪声导致渐近误差增加。

Conclusion: 量化通过梯度收缩和噪声影响SGD收敛，需权衡精度和训练效率。

Abstract: Low-precision training has become essential for reducing the computational
and memory costs of large-scale deep learning. However, quantization of
gradients introduces both magnitude shrinkage and additive noise, which can
alter the convergence behavior of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In this
work, we study the convergence of SGD under a gradient shrinkage model, where
each stochastic gradient is scaled by a factor $q_k \in (0,1]$ and perturbed by
zero-mean quantization noise. We show that this shrinkage is equivalent to
replacing the nominal stepsize $\mu_k$ with an effective stepsize $\mu_k q_k$,
which slows convergence when $q_{\min} < 1$. Under standard smoothness and
bounded-variance assumptions, we prove that low-precision SGD still converges,
but at a reduced rate determined by $q_{\min}$, and with an increased
asymptotic error floor due to quantization noise. We theoretically analyze how
reduced numerical precision slows down training by modeling it as gradient
shrinkage in the standard SGD convergence framework.

Motivation: 探索Transformer的深度如何影响其上下文学习（ICL）能力，特别是针对高阶马尔可夫过程。

Method: 通过理论分析，证明两层单头Transformer能够表示任何条件k-gram，并简化了一阶马尔可夫链的学习动态分析。

Result: 结果表明，即使浅层架构也能在结构化序列建模任务中表现出强大的ICL能力。

Conclusion: 研究深化了对Transformer ICL的理解，展示了浅层架构的潜力。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a hallmark capability of transformers, through
which trained models learn to adapt to new tasks by leveraging information from
the input context. Prior work has shown that ICL emerges in transformers due to
the presence of special circuits called induction heads. Given the equivalence
between induction heads and conditional k-grams, a recent line of work modeling
sequential inputs as Markov processes has revealed the fundamental impact of
model depth on its ICL capabilities: while a two-layer transformer can
efficiently represent a conditional 1-gram model, its single-layer counterpart
cannot solve the task unless it is exponentially large. However, for higher
order Markov sources, the best known constructions require at least three
layers (each with a single attention head) - leaving open the question: can a
two-layer single-head transformer represent any kth-order Markov process? In
this paper, we precisely address this and theoretically show that a two-layer
transformer with one head per layer can indeed represent any conditional
k-gram. Thus, our result provides the tightest known characterization of the
interplay between transformer depth and Markov order for ICL. Building on this,
we further analyze the learning dynamics of our two-layer construction,
focusing on a simplified variant for first-order Markov chains, illustrating
how effective in-context representations emerge during training. Together,
these results deepen our current understanding of transformer-based ICL and
illustrate how even shallow architectures can surprisingly exhibit strong ICL
capabilities on structured sequence modeling tasks.

Motivation: 传统方法如高斯过程（GPs）和神经过程（NPs）在建模复杂多模态分布时存在局限性，而神经扩散过程（NDPs）在输入耦合和终点语义一致性上表现不足。

Result: 在合成数据、EEG信号回归和图像回归任务中，NBP显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: NBP通过DDPM风格的桥采样，有效提升了结构化预测任务的性能和理论一致性。

Abstract: Learning stochastic functions from partially observed context-target pairs is
a fundamental problem in probabilistic modeling. Traditional models like
Gaussian Processes (GPs) face scalability issues with large datasets and assume
Gaussianity, limiting their applicability. While Neural Processes (NPs) offer
more flexibility, they struggle with capturing complex, multi-modal target
distributions. Neural Diffusion Processes (NDPs) enhance expressivity through a
learned diffusion process but rely solely on conditional signals in the
denoising network, resulting in weak input coupling from an unconditional
forward process and semantic mismatch at the diffusion endpoint. In this work,
we propose Neural Bridge Processes (NBPs), a novel method for modeling
stochastic functions where inputs x act as dynamic anchors for the entire
diffusion trajectory. By reformulating the forward kernel to explicitly depend
on x, NBP enforces a constrained path that strictly terminates at the
supervised target. This approach not only provides stronger gradient signals
but also guarantees endpoint coherence. We validate NBPs on synthetic data, EEG
signal regression and image regression tasks, achieving substantial
improvements over baselines. These results underscore the effectiveness of
DDPM-style bridge sampling in enhancing both performance and theoretical
consistency for structured prediction tasks.

Abstract: Estimating individualized treatment effects from observational data presents
a persistent challenge due to unmeasured confounding and structural bias.
Causal Machine Learning (causal ML) methods, such as causal trees and doubly
robust estimators, provide tools for estimating conditional average treatment
effects. These methods have limited effectiveness in complex real-world
environments due to the presence of latent confounders or those described in
unstructured formats. Moreover, reliance on domain experts for confounder
identification and rule interpretation introduces high annotation cost and
scalability concerns. In this work, we proposed Large Language Model-based
agents for automated confounder discovery and subgroup analysis that integrate
agents into the causal ML pipeline to simulate domain expertise. Our framework
systematically performs subgroup identification and confounding structure
discovery by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based agents, which
reduces human dependency while preserving interpretability. Experiments on
real-world medical datasets show that our proposed approach enhances treatment
effect estimation robustness by narrowing confidence intervals and uncovering
unrecognized confounding biases. Our findings suggest that LLM-based agents
offer a promising path toward scalable, trustworthy, and semantically aware
causal inference.

Conclusion: EDGE框架在理论上证明了其有效性，未来将进行实证研究。

Abstract: We present EDGE, a general-purpose, misconception-aware adaptive learning
framework composed of four stages: Evaluate (ability and state estimation),
Diagnose (posterior infer-ence of misconceptions), Generate (counterfactual
item synthesis), and Exercise (index-based retrieval scheduling). EDGE unifies
psychometrics (IRT/Bayesian state space models), cog-nitive diagnostics
(misconception discovery from distractor patterns and response latencies),
contrastive item generation (minimal perturbations that invalidate learner
shortcuts while pre-serving psychometric validity), and principled scheduling
(a restless bandit approximation to spaced retrieval). We formalize a composite
readiness metric, EdgeScore, prove its monotonicity and Lipschitz continuity,
and derive an index policy that is near-optimal under mild assumptions on
forgetting and learning gains. We further establish conditions under which
counterfactual items provably reduce the posterior probability of a targeted
misconception faster than standard practice. The paper focuses on theory and
implementable pseudocode; empirical study is left to future work.

Motivation: 启发式负采样可能因环境混杂因素（如曝光或流行度偏差）引入虚假硬负样本，损害模型泛化能力。

Method: 提出CNSDiff，利用条件扩散过程在潜在空间合成负样本，并加入因果正则化项减少混杂因素影响。

Result: 在四种分布偏移场景下，CNSDiff平均性能提升13.96%，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: CNSDiff有效减少虚假硬负样本，提升推荐系统在分布偏移下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Heuristic negative sampling enhances recommendation performance by selecting
negative samples of varying hardness levels from predefined candidate pools to
guide the model toward learning more accurate decision boundaries. However, our
empirical and theoretical analyses reveal that unobserved environmental
confounders (e.g., exposure or popularity biases) in candidate pools may cause
heuristic sampling methods to introduce false hard negatives (FHNS). These
misleading samples can encourage the model to learn spurious correlations
induced by such confounders, ultimately compromising its generalization ability
under distribution shifts. To address this issue, we propose a novel method
named Causal Negative Sampling via Diffusion (CNSDiff). By synthesizing
negative samples in the latent space via a conditional diffusion process,
CNSDiff avoids the bias introduced by predefined candidate pools and thus
reduces the likelihood of generating FHNS. Moreover, it incorporates a causal
regularization term to explicitly mitigate the influence of environmental
confounders during the negative sampling process, leading to robust negatives
that promote out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Comprehensive
experiments under four representative distribution shift scenarios demonstrate
that CNSDiff achieves an average improvement of 13.96% across all evaluation
metrics compared to state-of-the-art baselines, verifying its effectiveness and
robustness in OOD recommendation tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在强化学习中解决风险敏感控制问题的方法，通过最大化失真风险度量（DRM）来寻找最优策略，并证明了算法的二阶收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注风险中性目标的一阶收敛或风险敏感目标的一阶收敛，缺乏对风险敏感目标的二阶收敛分析。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用似然比方法推导了DRM目标的策略Hessian定理，提出了一种基于样本轨迹的Hessian估计器，并设计了一个立方正则化的策略牛顿算法。

Result: 算法收敛到DRM目标的ε-二阶平稳点（ε-SOSP），样本复杂度为O(ε^{-3.5})，实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 本文首次实现了风险敏感目标的二阶收敛，为风险敏感控制提供了新的理论和算法支持。

Abstract: We consider the problem of risk-sensitive control in a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework. In particular, we aim to find a risk-optimal policy by
maximizing the distortion riskmetric (DRM) of the discounted reward in a finite
horizon Markov decision process (MDP). DRMs are a rich class of risk measures
that include several well-known risk measures as special cases. We derive a
policy Hessian theorem for the DRM objective using the likelihood ratio method.
Using this result, we propose a natural DRM Hessian estimator from sample
trajectories of the underlying MDP. Next, we present a cubic-regularized policy
Newton algorithm for solving this problem in an on-policy RL setting using
estimates of the DRM gradient and Hessian. Our proposed algorithm is shown to
converge to an $\epsilon$-second-order stationary point ($\epsilon$-SOSP) of
the DRM objective, and this guarantee ensures the escaping of saddle points.
The sample complexity of our algorithms to find an $ \epsilon$-SOSP is
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3.5})$. Our experiments validate the theoretical
findings. To the best of our knowledge, our is the first work to present
convergence to an $\epsilon$-SOSP of a risk-sensitive objective, while existing
works in the literature have either shown convergence to a first-order
stationary point of a risk-sensitive objective, or a SOSP of a risk-neutral
one.

Motivation: 临床癫痫诊断依赖耗时的手工EEG分析，现有机器学习方法因数据集特定优化而泛化能力不足。

Method: 开发了一个包含自动预处理和多数投票机制的框架，评估其在两个不同EEG数据集上的表现和跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架为临床部署提供了基础，具有广泛采用潜力，可作为专家诊断的补充而非替代。

Abstract: Reliable seizure detection is critical for diagnosing and managing epilepsy,
yet clinical workflows remain dependent on time-consuming manual EEG
interpretation. While machine learning has shown promise, existing approaches
often rely on dataset-specific optimisations, limiting their real-world
applicability and reproducibility. Here, we introduce an innovative,
open-source machine-learning framework that enables robust and generalisable
seizure detection across varied clinical datasets. We evaluate our approach on
two publicly available EEG datasets that differ in patient populations and
electrode configurations. To enhance robustness, the framework incorporates an
automated pre-processing pipeline to standardise data and a majority voting
mechanism, in which multiple models independently assess each second of EEG
before reaching a final decision. We train, tune, and evaluate models within
each dataset, assessing their cross-dataset transferability. Our models achieve
high within-dataset performance (AUC 0.904+/-0.059 for CHB-MIT and
0.864+/-0.060 for TUSZ) and demonstrate strong generalisation across datasets
despite differences in EEG setups and populations (AUC 0.615+/-0.039 for models
trained on CHB-MIT and tested on TUSZ and 0.762+/-0.175 in the reverse case)
without any post-processing. Furthermore, a mild post-processing improved the
within-dataset results to 0.913+/-0.064 and 0.867+/-0.058 and cross-dataset
results to 0.619+/-0.036 and 0.768+/-0.172. These results underscore the
potential of, and essential considerations for, deploying our framework in
diverse clinical settings. By making our methodology fully reproducible, we
provide a foundation for advancing clinically viable, dataset-agnostic seizure
detection systems. This approach has the potential for widespread adoption,
complementing rather than replacing expert interpretation, and accelerating
clinical integration.

Conclusion: 论文总结了影响函数的潜力，并指出了未来在大规模深度学习场景中的应用方向。

Abstract: The goal of data attribution is to trace the model's predictions through the
learning algorithm and back to its training data. thereby identifying the most
influential training samples and understanding how the model's behavior leads
to particular predictions. Understanding how individual training examples
influence a model's predictions is fundamental for machine learning
interpretability, data debugging, and model accountability. Influence
functions, originating from robust statistics, offer an efficient, first-order
approximation to estimate the impact of marginally upweighting or removing a
data point on a model's learned parameters and its subsequent predictions,
without the need for expensive retraining. This paper comprehensively reviews
the data attribution capability of influence functions in deep learning. We
discuss their theoretical foundations, recent algorithmic advances for
efficient inverse-Hessian-vector product estimation, and evaluate their
effectiveness for data attribution and mislabel detection. Finally,
highlighting current challenges and promising directions for unleashing the
huge potential of influence functions in large-scale, real-world deep learning
scenarios.

Result: 实验显示预测性能与实际性能高度相关，验证了理论和评估方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 论文统一了SSL与Nesy的理论框架，并提供了理论支持的无监督任务选择方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic (Nesy) learning improves the target task performance of models
by enabling them to satisfy knowledge, while semi/self-supervised learning
(SSL) improves the target task performance by designing unsupervised pretext
tasks for unlabeled data to make models satisfy corresponding assumptions. We
extend the Nesy theory based on reliable knowledge to the scenario of
unreliable knowledge (i.e., assumptions), thereby unifying the theoretical
frameworks of SSL and Nesy. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we
demonstrate that, in theory, the impact of pretext tasks on target performance
hinges on three factors: knowledge learnability with respect to the model,
knowledge reliability with respect to the data, and knowledge completeness with
respect to the target. We further propose schemes to operationalize these
theoretical metrics, and thereby develop a method that can predict the
effectiveness of pretext tasks in advance. This will change the current status
quo in practical applications, where the selections of unsupervised tasks are
heuristic-based rather than theory-based, and it is difficult to evaluate the
rationality of unsupervised pretext task selection before testing the model on
the target task. In experiments, we verify a high correlation between the
predicted performance-estimated using minimal data-and the actual performance
achieved after large-scale semi-supervised or self-supervised learning, thus
confirming the validity of the theory and the effectiveness of the evaluation
method.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了MoE模型在边缘部署中的量化精度和内存效率问题，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: With the breakthrough progress of large language models (LLMs) in natural
language processing and multimodal tasks, efficiently deploying them on
resource-constrained edge devices has become a critical challenge. The Mixture
of Experts (MoE) architecture enhances model capacity through sparse
activation, but faces two major difficulties in practical deployment: (1) The
presence of numerous outliers in activation distributions leads to severe
degradation in quantization accuracy for both activations and weights,
significantly impairing inference performance; (2) Under limited memory,
efficient offloading and collaborative inference of expert modules struggle to
balance latency and throughput. To address these issues, this paper proposes an
efficient MoE edge deployment scheme based on Hessian-Aware Quantization (HAQ)
and CPU-GPU collaborative inference. First, by introducing smoothed Hessian
matrix quantization, we achieve joint 8-bit quantization of activations and
weights, which significantly alleviates the accuracy loss caused by outliers
while ensuring efficient implementation on mainstream hardware. Second, we
design an expert-level collaborative offloading and inference mechanism, which,
combined with expert activation path statistics, enables efficient deployment
and scheduling of expert modules between CPU and GPU, greatly reducing memory
footprint and inference latency. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our method on mainstream large models such as the OPT series
and Mixtral 8*7B: on datasets like Wikitext2 and C4, the inference accuracy of
the low-bit quantized model approaches that of the full-precision model, while
GPU memory usage is reduced by about 60%, and inference latency is
significantly improved.

Abstract: Stochastic interpolants offer a robust framework for continuously
transforming samples between arbitrary data distributions, holding significant
promise for generative modeling. Despite their potential, rigorous finite-time
convergence guarantees for practical numerical schemes remain largely
unexplored. In this work, we address the finite-time convergence analysis of
numerical implementations for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) derived
from stochastic interpolants. Specifically, we establish novel finite-time
error bounds in total variation distance for two widely used numerical
integrators: the first-order forward Euler method and the second-order Heun's
method. Furthermore, our analysis on the iteration complexity of specific
stochastic interpolant constructions provides optimized schedules to enhance
computational efficiency. Our theoretical findings are corroborated by
numerical experiments, which validate the derived error bounds and complexity
analyses.

Abstract: \textbf{Introduction:} Accurate prediction of Phage Virion Proteins (PVP) is
essential for genomic studies due to their crucial role as structural elements
in bacteriophages. Computational tools, particularly machine learning, have
emerged for annotating phage protein sequences from high-throughput sequencing.
However, effective annotation requires specialized sequence encodings. Our
paper introduces ProteoKnight, a new image-based encoding method that addresses
spatial constraints in existing techniques, yielding competitive performance in
PVP classification using pre-trained convolutional neural networks.
Additionally, our study evaluates prediction uncertainty in binary PVP
classification through Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD). \textbf{Methods:}
ProteoKnight adapts the classical DNA-Walk algorithm for protein sequences,
incorporating pixel colors and adjusting walk distances to capture intricate
protein features. Encoded sequences were classified using multiple pre-trained
CNNs. Variance and entropy measures assessed prediction uncertainty across
proteins of various classes and lengths. \textbf{Results:} Our experiments
achieved 90.8% accuracy in binary classification, comparable to
state-of-the-art methods. Multi-class classification accuracy remains
suboptimal. Our uncertainty analysis unveils variability in prediction
confidence influenced by protein class and sequence length.
\textbf{Conclusions:} Our study surpasses frequency chaos game representation
(FCGR) by introducing novel image encoding that mitigates spatial information
loss limitations. Our classification technique yields accurate and robust PVP
predictions while identifying low-confidence predictions.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in the theory of deep learning is to understand
whether gradient-based training in high-dimensional parameter spaces can be
captured by simpler, lower-dimensional structures, leading to so-called
implicit bias. As a stepping stone, we study when a gradient flow on a
high-dimensional variable $\theta$ implies an intrinsic gradient flow on a
lower-dimensional variable $z = \phi(\theta)$, for an architecture-related
function $\phi$. We express a so-called intrinsic dynamic property and show how
it is related to the study of conservation laws associated with the
factorization $\phi$. This leads to a simple criterion based on the inclusion
of kernels of linear maps which yields a necessary condition for this property
to hold. We then apply our theory to general ReLU networks of arbitrary depth
and show that, for any initialization, it is possible to rewrite the flow as an
intrinsic dynamic in a lower dimension that depends only on $z$ and the
initialization, when $\phi$ is the so-called path-lifting. In the case of
linear networks with $\phi$ the product of weight matrices, so-called balanced
initializations are also known to enable such a dimensionality reduction; we
generalize this result to a broader class of {\em relaxed balanced}
initializations, showing that, in certain configurations, these are the
\emph{only} initializations that ensure the intrinsic dynamic property.
Finally, for the linear neural ODE associated with the limit of infinitely deep
linear networks, with relaxed balanced initialization, we explicitly express
the corresponding intrinsic dynamics.

Abstract: Modern methods of generative modelling and unpaired image-to-image
translation based on Schr\"odinger bridges and stochastic optimal control
theory aim to transform an initial density to a target one in an optimal way.
In the present paper, we assume that we only have access to i.i.d. samples from
initial and final distributions. This makes our setup suitable for both
generative modelling and unpaired image-to-image translation. Relying on the
stochastic optimal control approach, we choose an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process as
the reference one and estimate the corresponding Schr\"odinger potential.
Introducing a risk function as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between
couplings, we derive tight bounds on generalization ability of an empirical
risk minimizer in a class of Schr\"odinger potentials including Gaussian
mixtures. Thanks to the mixing properties of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, we
almost achieve fast rates of convergence up to some logarithmic factors in
favourable scenarios. We also illustrate performance of the suggested approach
with numerical experiments.

Result: 多层SSM仍无法解决奇偶校验任务，表明需要输入依赖且含负特征值的递归层。

Conclusion: 递归层需同时具备输入依赖性和负特征值才能有效解决状态跟踪任务。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that LRNN models such as S4D, Mamba, and DeltaNet lack
state-tracking capability due to either time-invariant transition matrices or
restricted eigenvalue ranges. To address this, input-dependent transition
matrices, particularly those that are complex or non-triangular, have been
proposed to enhance SSM performance on such tasks. While existing theorems
demonstrate that both input-independent and non-negative SSMs are incapable of
solving simple state-tracking tasks, such as parity, regardless of depth, they
do not explore whether combining these two types in a multilayer SSM could
help. We investigate this question for efficient SSMs with diagonal transition
matrices and show that such combinations still fail to solve parity. This
implies that a recurrence layer must both be input-dependent and include
negative eigenvalues. Our experiments support this conclusion by analyzing an
SSM model that combines S4D and Mamba layers.

Conclusion: 通过先验假设和优化方法，论文为时变奖励函数恢复提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of recovering time-varying reward
functions from either optimal policies or demonstrations coming from a max
entropy reinforcement learning problem. This problem is highly ill-posed
without additional assumptions on the underlying rewards. However, in many
applications, the rewards are indeed parsimonious, and some prior information
is available. We consider two such priors on the rewards: 1) rewards are mostly
constant and they change infrequently, 2) rewards can be represented by a
linear combination of a small number of feature functions. We first show that
the reward identification problem with the former prior can be recast as a
sparsification problem subject to linear constraints. Moreover, we give a
polynomial-time algorithm that solves this sparsification problem exactly.
Then, we show that identifying rewards representable with the minimum number of
features can be recast as a rank minimization problem subject to linear
constraints, for which convex relaxations of rank can be invoked. In both
cases, these observations lead to efficient optimization-based reward
identification algorithms. Several examples are given to demonstrate the
accuracy of the recovered rewards as well as their generalizability.

Result: 实验表明，DeepLight将公平威胁评分(ETS)提高了18%-30%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DeepLight为闪电预测提供了更稳健的解决方案，显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Lightning, a common feature of severe meteorological conditions, poses
significant risks, from direct human injuries to substantial economic losses.
These risks are further exacerbated by climate change. Early and accurate
prediction of lightning would enable preventive measures to safeguard people,
protect property, and minimize economic losses. In this paper, we present
DeepLight, a novel deep learning architecture for predicting lightning
occurrences. Existing prediction models face several critical limitations: they
often struggle to capture the dynamic spatial context and inherent uncertainty
of lightning events, underutilize key observational data, such as radar
reflectivity and cloud properties, and rely heavily on Numerical Weather
Prediction (NWP) systems, which are both computationally expensive and highly
sensitive to parameter settings. To overcome these challenges, DeepLight
leverages multi-source meteorological data, including radar reflectivity, cloud
properties, and historical lightning occurrences through a dual-encoder
architecture. By employing multi-branch convolution techniques, it dynamically
captures spatial correlations across varying extents. Furthermore, its novel
Hazy Loss function explicitly addresses the spatio-temporal uncertainty of
lightning by penalizing deviations based on proximity to true events, enabling
the model to better learn patterns amidst randomness. Extensive experiments
show that DeepLight improves the Equitable Threat Score (ETS) by 18%-30% over
state-of-the-art methods, establishing it as a robust solution for lightning
prediction.

Conclusion: DOOL方法在解决耗散方程方面表现出色，并可扩展至不直接遵循Onsager变分原理的二阶波动模型。

Abstract: Existing operator learning methods rely on supervised training with
high-fidelity simulation data, introducing significant computational cost. In
this work, we propose the deep Onsager operator learning (DOOL) method, a novel
unsupervised framework for solving dissipative equations. Rooted in the Onsager
variational principle (OVP), DOOL trains a deep operator network by directly
minimizing the OVP-defined Rayleighian functional, requiring no labeled data,
and then proceeds in time explicitly through conservation/change laws for the
solution. Another key innovation here lies in the spatiotemporal decoupling
strategy: the operator's trunk network processes spatial coordinates
exclusively, thereby enhancing training efficiency, while integrated external
time stepping enables temporal extrapolation. Numerical experiments on typical
dissipative equations validate the effectiveness of the DOOL method, and
systematic comparisons with supervised DeepONet and MIONet demonstrate its
enhanced performance. Extensions are made to cover the second-order wave models
with dissipation that do not directly follow OVP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀疏奖励信号下学习有效特征的挑战，避免复杂辅助目标或解耦设计。

Method: 提出SCORER框架，将感知与控制网络的交互建模为Stackelberg博弈，感知网络学习特征以优化控制网络的目标。

Result: 在标准DQN变体上，SCORER提高了样本效率和最终性能。

Conclusion: 通过结构化感知与控制动态的算法设计，无需复杂辅助目标即可实现性能提升。

Abstract: Integrated, end-to-end learning of representations and policies remains a
cornerstone of deep reinforcement learning (RL). However, to address the
challenge of learning effective features from a sparse reward signal, recent
trends have shifted towards adding complex auxiliary objectives or fully
decoupling the two processes, often at the cost of increased design complexity.
This work proposes an alternative to both decoupling and naive end-to-end
learning, arguing that performance can be significantly improved by structuring
the interaction between distinct perception and control networks with a
principled, game-theoretic dynamic. We formalize this dynamic by introducing
the Stackelberg Coupled Representation and Reinforcement Learning (SCORER)
framework, which models the interaction between perception and control as a
Stackelberg game. The perception network (leader) strategically learns features
to benefit the control network (follower), whose own objective is to minimize
its Bellman error. We approximate the game's equilibrium with a practical
two-timescale algorithm. Applied to standard DQN variants on benchmark tasks,
SCORER improves sample efficiency and final performance. Our results show that
performance gains can be achieved through principled algorithmic design of the
perception-control dynamic, without requiring complex auxiliary objectives or
architectures.

Motivation: 随着遗忘权的需求增长，机器遗忘被广泛研究，但预测不确定性在恶意遗忘攻击下的脆弱性尚未被探索。

Method: 设计了针对预测不确定性的新型恶意遗忘攻击，并提出了优化框架，包括黑盒场景实验。

Result: 实验表明，该攻击比传统攻击更有效，且现有防御措施无法抵御。

Conclusion: 首次揭示了预测不确定性在恶意遗忘攻击中的脆弱性，为未来防御研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Currently, various uncertainty quantification methods have been proposed to
provide certainty and probability estimates for deep learning models' label
predictions. Meanwhile, with the growing demand for the right to be forgotten,
machine unlearning has been extensively studied as a means to remove the impact
of requested sensitive data from a pre-trained model without retraining the
model from scratch. However, the vulnerabilities of such generated predictive
uncertainties with regard to dedicated malicious unlearning attacks remain
unexplored. To bridge this gap, for the first time, we propose a new class of
malicious unlearning attacks against predictive uncertainties, where the
adversary aims to cause the desired manipulations of specific predictive
uncertainty results. We also design novel optimization frameworks for our
attacks and conduct extensive experiments, including black-box scenarios.
Notably, our extensive experiments show that our attacks are more effective in
manipulating predictive uncertainties than traditional attacks that focus on
label misclassifications, and existing defenses against conventional attacks
are ineffective against our attacks.

Conclusion: MOTGNN在多组学疾病建模中展现出优越的预测性能和可解释性，为生物标志物发现提供了新工具。

Abstract: Integrating multi-omics data, such as DNA methylation, mRNA expression, and
microRNA (miRNA) expression, offers a comprehensive view of the biological
mechanisms underlying disease. However, the high dimensionality and complex
interactions among omics layers present major challenges for predictive
modeling. We propose Multi-Omics integration with Tree-generated Graph Neural
Network (MOTGNN), a novel and interpretable framework for binary disease
classification. MOTGNN employs eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to perform
omics-specific supervised graph construction, followed by modality-specific
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for hierarchical representation learning, and a
deep feedforward network for cross-omics integration. On three real-world
disease datasets, MOTGNN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 5-10% in
accuracy, ROC-AUC, and F1-score, and remains robust to severe class imbalance
(e.g., 87.2% vs. 33.4% F1 on imbalanced data). The model maintains
computational efficiency through sparse graphs (2.1-2.8 edges per node) and
provides built-in interpretability, revealing both top-ranked biomarkers and
the relative contributions of each omics modality. These results highlight
MOTGNN's potential to improve both predictive accuracy and interpretability in
multi-omics disease modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注梯度估计方差有限的情况，而重尾分布（梯度仅具有有限p阶中心矩）下的OCO性能研究较少。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 分析了经典OCO算法（如在线梯度下降）在重尾条件下的性能，未对算法做任何修改。

Result: 证明了这些算法在重尾条件下仍能实现完全最优的遗憾界，且无需额外操作（如梯度裁剪）。

Conclusion: 重尾条件下的OCO问题可通过经典算法有效解决，无需额外操作。结果还拓展到非光滑非凸优化和乐观算法等更广泛场景。

Abstract: In Online Convex Optimization (OCO), when the stochastic gradient has a
finite variance, many algorithms provably work and guarantee a sublinear
regret. However, limited results are known if the gradient estimate has a heavy
tail, i.e., the stochastic gradient only admits a finite $\mathsf{p}$-th
central moment for some $\mathsf{p}\in\left(1,2\right]$. Motivated by it, this
work examines different old algorithms for OCO (e.g., Online Gradient Descent)
in the more challenging heavy-tailed setting. Under the standard bounded domain
assumption, we establish new regrets for these classical methods without any
algorithmic modification. Remarkably, these regret bounds are fully optimal in
all parameters (can be achieved even without knowing $\mathsf{p}$), suggesting
that OCO with heavy tails can be solved effectively without any extra operation
(e.g., gradient clipping). Our new results have several applications. A
particularly interesting one is the first provable convergence result for
nonsmooth nonconvex optimization under heavy-tailed noise without gradient
clipping. Furthermore, we explore broader settings (e.g., smooth OCO) and
extend our ideas to optimistic algorithms to handle different cases
simultaneously.

Conclusion: N-BEATS-MOE在性能和可解释性上均有提升，特别适合处理异质性时间序列。

Abstract: Deep learning approaches are increasingly relevant for time series
forecasting tasks. Methods such as N-BEATS, which is built on stacks of
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) blocks, have achieved state-of-the-art results on
benchmark datasets and competitions. N-BEATS is also more interpretable
relative to other deep learning approaches, as it decomposes forecasts into
different time series components, such as trend and seasonality. In this work,
we present N-BEATS-MOE, an extension of N-BEATS based on a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) layer. N-BEATS-MOE employs a dynamic block weighting strategy based on a
gating network which allows the model to better adapt to the characteristics of
each time series. We also hypothesize that the gating mechanism provides
additional interpretability by identifying which expert is most relevant for
each series. We evaluate our method across 12 benchmark datasets against
several approaches, achieving consistent improvements on several datasets,
especially those composed of heterogeneous time series.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化min-max优化中，模型更新共享可能导致敏感数据泄露，差分隐私虽能保护隐私，但噪声可能影响收敛性能。

Method: 基于STORM算法，设计DPMixSGD，在局部梯度中添加噪声，理论证明噪声不影响收敛，并提供隐私保证。

Result: 实验验证了算法的有效性，噪声未显著影响收敛性能，同时确保隐私保护。

Conclusion: DPMixSGD在非凸去中心化min-max优化中，平衡了隐私保护和收敛性能。

Abstract: Decentralized min-max optimization allows multi-agent systems to
collaboratively solve global min-max optimization problems by facilitating the
exchange of model updates among neighboring agents, eliminating the need for a
central server. However, sharing model updates in such systems carry a risk of
exposing sensitive data to inference attacks, raising significant privacy
concerns. To mitigate these privacy risks, differential privacy (DP) has become
a widely adopted technique for safeguarding individual data. Despite its
advantages, implementing DP in decentralized min-max optimization poses
challenges, as the added noise can hinder convergence, particularly in
non-convex scenarios with complex agent interactions in min-max optimization
problems. In this work, we propose an algorithm called DPMixSGD (Differential
Private Minmax Hybrid Stochastic Gradient Descent), a novel privacy-preserving
algorithm specifically designed for non-convex decentralized min-max
optimization. Our method builds on the state-of-the-art STORM-based algorithm,
one of the fastest decentralized min-max solutions. We rigorously prove that
the noise added to local gradients does not significantly compromise
convergence performance, and we provide theoretical bounds to ensure privacy
guarantees. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct extensive
experiments across various tasks and models, demonstrating the effectiveness of
our approach.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着时空神经网络在城市计算中的应用增加，其预测偏差可能加剧社会经济不平等，因此需要公平的预测方法。

Conclusion: FairDRL-ST为时空预测中的公平性问题提供了一种有效且性能损失小的解决方案。

Abstract: As deep spatio-temporal neural networks are increasingly utilised in urban
computing contexts, the deployment of such methods can have a direct impact on
users of critical urban infrastructure, such as public transport, emergency
services, and traffic management systems. While many spatio-temporal methods
focus on improving accuracy, fairness has recently gained attention due to
growing evidence that biased predictions in spatio-temporal applications can
disproportionately disadvantage certain demographic or geographic groups,
thereby reinforcing existing socioeconomic inequalities and undermining the
ethical deployment of AI in public services. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework, FairDRL-ST, based on disentangled representation learning, to
address fairness concerns in spatio-temporal prediction, with a particular
focus on mobility demand forecasting. By leveraging adversarial learning and
disentangled representation learning, our framework learns to separate
attributes that contain sensitive information. Unlike existing methods that
enforce fairness through supervised learning, which may lead to
overcompensation and degraded performance, our framework achieves fairness in
an unsupervised manner with minimal performance loss. We apply our framework to
real-world urban mobility datasets and demonstrate its ability to close
fairness gaps while delivering competitive predictive performance compared to
state-of-the-art fairness-aware methods.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable bearing fault classification is critical for
ensuring the reliability of rotating machinery, particularly under variable
operating conditions where domain shifts can significantly degrade model
performance. This study proposes a physics-informed multimodal convolutional
neural network (CNN) with a late fusion architecture, integrating vibration and
motor current signals alongside a dedicated physics-based feature extraction
branch. The model incorporates a novel physics-informed loss function that
penalizes physically implausible predictions based on characteristic bearing
fault frequencies - Ball Pass Frequency Outer (BPFO) and Ball Pass Frequency
Inner (BPFI) - derived from bearing geometry and shaft speed. Comprehensive
experiments on the Paderborn University dataset demonstrate that the proposed
physics-informed approach consistently outperforms a non-physics-informed
baseline, achieving higher accuracy, reduced false classifications, and
improved robustness across multiple data splits. To address performance
degradation under unseen operating conditions, three transfer learning (TL)
strategies - Target-Specific Fine-Tuning (TSFT), Layer-Wise Adaptation Strategy
(LAS), and Hybrid Feature Reuse (HFR) - are evaluated. Results show that LAS
yields the best generalization, with additional performance gains when combined
with physics-informed modeling. Validation on the KAIST bearing dataset
confirms the framework's cross-dataset applicability, achieving up to 98
percent accuracy. Statistical hypothesis testing further verifies significant
improvements (p < 0.01) in classification performance. The proposed framework
demonstrates the potential of integrating domain knowledge with data-driven
learning to achieve robust, interpretable, and generalizable fault diagnosis
for real-world industrial applications.

Result: 该策略相比轮询和随机策略，推理误差降低高达55%。

Conclusion: 优化任务导向的AoI函数可显著提升远程推理准确性。

Abstract: We consider a remote inference system with multiple modalities, where a
multimodal machine learning (ML) model performs real-time inference using
features collected from remote sensors. As sensor observations may change
dynamically over time, fresh features are critical for inference tasks.
However, timely delivering features from all modalities is often infeasible due
to limited network resources. To this end, we study a two-modality scheduling
problem to minimize the ML model's inference error, which is expressed as a
penalty function of AoI for both modalities. We develop an index-based
threshold policy and prove its optimality. Specifically, the scheduler switches
modalities when the current modality's index function exceeds a threshold. We
show that the two modalities share the same threshold, and both the index
functions and the threshold can be computed efficiently. The optimality of our
policy holds for (i) general AoI functions that are \emph{non-monotonic} and
\emph{non-additive} and (ii) \emph{heterogeneous} transmission times. Numerical
results show that our policy reduces inference error by up to 55% compared to
round-robin and uniform random policies, which are oblivious to the AoI-based
inference error function. Our results shed light on how to improve remote
inference accuracy by optimizing task-oriented AoI functions.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes
domains where reliability is paramount. This thesis investigates how
uncertainty estimation can enhance the safety and trustworthiness of ML,
focusing on selective prediction -- where models abstain when confidence is
low.
  We first show that a model's training trajectory contains rich uncertainty
signals that can be exploited without altering its architecture or loss. By
ensembling predictions from intermediate checkpoints, we propose a lightweight,
post-hoc abstention method that works across tasks, avoids the cost of deep
ensembles, and achieves state-of-the-art selective prediction performance.
Crucially, this approach is fully compatible with differential privacy (DP),
allowing us to study how privacy noise affects uncertainty quality. We find
that while many methods degrade under DP, our trajectory-based approach remains
robust, and we introduce a framework for isolating the privacy-uncertainty
trade-off. Next, we then develop a finite-sample decomposition of the selective
classification gap -- the deviation from the oracle accuracy-coverage curve --
identifying five interpretable error sources and clarifying which interventions
can close the gap. This explains why calibration alone cannot fix ranking
errors, motivating methods that improve uncertainty ordering. Finally, we show
that uncertainty signals can be adversarially manipulated to hide errors or
deny service while maintaining high accuracy, and we design defenses combining
calibration audits with verifiable inference.
  Together, these contributions advance reliable ML by improving, evaluating,
and safeguarding uncertainty estimation, enabling models that not only make
accurate predictions -- but also know when to say "I do not know".

Abstract: A curious phenomenon observed in some dynamical generative models is the
following: despite learning errors in the score function or the drift vector
field, the generated samples appear to shift \emph{along} the support of the
data distribution but not \emph{away} from it. In this work, we investigate
this phenomenon of \emph{robustness of the support} by taking a dynamical
systems approach on the generating stochastic/deterministic process. Our
perturbation analysis of the probability flow reveals that infinitesimal
learning errors cause the predicted density to be different from the target
density only on the data manifold for a wide class of generative models.
Further, what is the dynamical mechanism that leads to the robustness of the
support? We show that the alignment of the top Lyapunov vectors (most sensitive
infinitesimal perturbation directions) with the tangent spaces along the
boundary of the data manifold leads to robustness and prove a sufficient
condition on the dynamics of the generating process to achieve this alignment.
Moreover, the alignment condition is efficient to compute and, in practice, for
robust generative models, automatically leads to accurate estimates of the
tangent bundle of the data manifold. Using a finite-time linear perturbation
analysis on samples paths as well as probability flows, our work complements
and extends existing works on obtaining theoretical guarantees for generative
models from a stochastic analysis, statistical learning and uncertainty
quantification points of view. Our results apply across different dynamical
generative models, such as conditional flow-matching and score-based generative
models, and for different target distributions that may or may not satisfy the
manifold hypothesis.

Abstract: We present Klear-Reasoner, a model with long reasoning capabilities that
demonstrates careful deliberation during problem solving, achieving outstanding
performance across multiple benchmarks. Although there are already many
excellent works related to inference models in the current community, there are
still many problems with reproducing high-performance inference models due to
incomplete disclosure of training details. This report provides an in-depth
analysis of the reasoning model, covering the entire post-training workflow
from data preparation and long Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning (long
CoT SFT) to reinforcement learning (RL), along with detailed ablation studies
for each experimental component. For SFT data, our experiments show that a
small number of high-quality data sources are more effective than a large
number of diverse data sources, and that difficult samples can achieve better
results without accuracy filtering. In addition, we investigate two key issues
with current clipping mechanisms in RL: Clipping suppresses critical
exploration signals and ignores suboptimal trajectories. To address these
challenges, we propose Gradient-Preserving clipping Policy Optimization (GPPO)
that gently backpropagates gradients from clipped tokens. GPPO not only
enhances the model's exploration capacity but also improves its efficiency in
learning from negative samples. Klear-Reasoner exhibits exceptional reasoning
abilities in mathematics and programming, scoring 90.5\% on AIME 2024, 83.2\%
on AIME 2025, 66.0\% on LiveCodeBench V5 and 58.1\% on LiveCodeBench V6.

Conclusion: 这是首次在多项式时间内实现近似后验采样的正式结果。

Abstract: We study the problem of posterior sampling in the context of score based
generative models. We have a trained score network for a prior $p(x)$, a
measurement model $p(y|x)$, and are tasked with sampling from the posterior
$p(x|y)$. Prior work has shown this to be intractable in KL (in the worst case)
under well-accepted computational hardness assumptions. Despite this, popular
algorithms for tasks such as image super-resolution, stylization, and
reconstruction enjoy empirical success. Rather than establishing distributional
assumptions or restricted settings under which exact posterior sampling is
tractable, we view this as a more general "tilting" problem of biasing a
distribution towards a measurement. Under minimal assumptions, we show that one
can tractably sample from a distribution that is simultaneously close to the
posterior of a noised prior in KL divergence and the true posterior in Fisher
divergence. Intuitively, this combination ensures that the resulting sample is
consistent with both the measurement and the prior. To the best of our
knowledge these are the first formal results for (approximate) posterior
sampling in polynomial time.

Abstract: Attribution explanation is a typical approach for explaining deep neural
networks (DNNs), inferring an importance or contribution score for each input
variable to the final output. In recent years, numerous attribution methods
have been developed to explain DNNs. However, a persistent concern remains
unresolved, i.e., whether and which attribution methods faithfully reflect the
actual contribution of input variables to the decision-making process. The
faithfulness issue undermines the reliability and practical utility of
attribution explanations. We argue that these concerns stem from three core
challenges. First, difficulties arise in comparing attribution methods due to
their unstructured heterogeneity, differences in heuristics, formulations, and
implementations that lack a unified organization. Second, most methods lack
solid theoretical underpinnings, with their rationales remaining absent,
ambiguous, or unverified. Third, empirically evaluating faithfulness is
challenging without ground truth. Recent theoretical advances provide a
promising way to tackle these challenges, attracting increasing attention. We
summarize these developments, with emphasis on three key directions: (i)
Theoretical unification, which uncovers commonalities and differences among
methods, enabling systematic comparisons; (ii) Theoretical rationale,
clarifying the foundations of existing methods; (iii) Theoretical evaluation,
rigorously proving whether methods satisfy faithfulness principles. Beyond a
comprehensive review, we provide insights into how these studies help deepen
theoretical understanding, inform method selection, and inspire new attribution
methods. We conclude with a discussion of promising open problems for further
work.

Abstract: Implicit continuous models, such as functional models and implicit neural
networks, are an increasingly popular method for replacing discrete data
representations with continuous, high-order, and differentiable surrogates.
These models offer new perspectives on the storage, transfer, and analysis of
scientific data. In this paper, we introduce the first framework to directly
extract complex topological features -- contours, Jacobi sets, and ridge-valley
graphs -- from a type of continuous implicit model known as multivariate
functional approximation (MFA). MFA replaces discrete data with continuous
piecewise smooth functions. Given an MFA model as the input, our approach
enables direct extraction of complex topological features from the model,
without reverting to a discrete representation of the model. Our work is easily
generalizable to any continuous implicit model that supports the queries of
function values and high-order derivatives. Our work establishes the building
blocks for performing topological data analysis and visualization on implicit
continuous models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DMPO的方法，通过数据选择策略优化LLM对齐，解决了多偏好冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法（如DPO）在处理多偏好冲突数据时表现不佳，需要更可靠且可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 提出了DMPO目标和Preference Divergence（PD）项，通过选择高共识数据子集进行优化。

Result: 在UltraFeedback数据集上，该方法实现了10%以上的相对改进，同时提升了训练效率。

Conclusion: 该方法通过细粒度偏好信号实现了鲁棒的LLM对齐，避免了难以处理的整体偏好标注。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse human values requires
moving beyond a single holistic "better-than" preference criterion. While
collecting fine-grained, aspect-specific preference data is more reliable and
scalable, existing methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) struggle
with the severe noise and conflicts inherent in such aggregated datasets. In
this paper, we tackle this challenge from a data-centric perspective. We first
derive the Direct Multi-Preference Optimization (DMPO) objective, and uncover a
key Preference Divergence (PD) term that quantifies inter-aspect preference
conflicts. Instead of using this term for direct optimization, we leverage it
to formulate a novel, theoretically-grounded data selection principle. Our
principle advocates for selecting a subset of high-consensus data-identified by
the most negative PD values-for efficient DPO training. We prove the optimality
of this strategy by analyzing the loss bounds of the DMPO objective in the
selection problem. To operationalize our approach, we introduce practical
methods of PD term estimation and length bias mitigation, thereby proposing our
PD selection method. Evaluation on the UltraFeedback dataset with three varying
conflict levels shows that our simple yet effective strategy achieves over 10%
relative improvement against both the standard holistic preference and a
stronger oracle using aggregated preference signals, all while boosting
training efficiency and obviating the need for intractable holistic preference
annotating, unlocking the potential of robust LLM alignment via fine-grained
preference signals.

TL;DR: 多轮越狱攻击在大型语言模型（LLM）中的成功率超过70%，研究发现其复杂性与单轮攻击重复采样相当，且攻击成功率在类似模型间相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多轮越狱攻击对优化单轮防御的LLM的持续威胁，挑战其复杂性认知。

Method: 使用StrongREJECT基准对GPT-4、Claude和Gemini等先进模型进行多轮越狱攻击的实证分析。

Result: 多轮攻击成功率与单轮攻击重复采样相当，攻击成功率在类似模型间相关，推理能力越强的模型越易受攻击。

Conclusion: 研究结果对AI安全评估和抗越狱系统设计具有重要意义，并开源了相关代码。

Abstract: While defenses against single-turn jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models
(LLMs) have improved significantly, multi-turn jailbreaks remain a persistent
vulnerability, often achieving success rates exceeding 70% against models
optimized for single-turn protection. This work presents an empirical analysis
of automated multi-turn jailbreak attacks across state-of-the-art models
including GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini variants, using the StrongREJECT benchmark.
Our findings challenge the perceived sophistication of multi-turn attacks: when
accounting for the attacker's ability to learn from how models refuse harmful
requests, multi-turn jailbreaking approaches are approximately equivalent to
simply resampling single-turn attacks multiple times. Moreover, attack success
is correlated among similar models, making it easier to jailbreak newly
released ones. Additionally, for reasoning models, we find surprisingly that
higher reasoning effort often leads to higher attack success rates. Our results
have important implications for AI safety evaluation and the design of
jailbreak-resistant systems. We release the source code at

### [479] [Discovering Spatial Correlations between Earth Observations in Global Atmospheric State Estimation by using Adaptive Graph Structure Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07659)
*Hyeon-Ju Jeon,Jeon-Ho Kang,In-Hyuk Kwon,O-Joun Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究旨在通过时空图神经网络（STGNN）和结构学习，动态捕捉地球观测与大气状态之间的空间相关性，以提高全球大气状态估计的预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值天气预报（NWP）系统在固定网格点上预测大气状态，但观测数据位置不固定且气象环境动态变化，导致空间相关性复杂。需要一种方法动态处理这些变化。

Method: 采用带结构学习的STGNN，通过自适应确定节点度数和考虑空间距离来调节边采样，避免结构信息丢失和过平滑问题。

Result: 在东亚真实大气状态和观测数据上验证，该方法在高变异性区域优于现有STGNN模型（无论是否带结构学习）。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效处理动态空间相关性，提升大气状态预测精度。

Abstract: This study aims to discover spatial correlations between Earth observations
and atmospheric states to improve the forecasting accuracy of global
atmospheric state estimation, which are usually conducted using conventional
numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems and is the beginning of weather
forecasting. NWP systems predict future atmospheric states at fixed locations,
which are called NWP grid points, by analyzing previous atmospheric states and
newly acquired Earth observations without fixed locations. Thus, surrounding
meteorological context and the changing locations of the observations make
spatial correlations between atmospheric states and observations over time. To
handle complicated spatial correlations, which change dynamically, we employ
spatiotemporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) with structure learning. However,
structure learning has an inherent limitation that this can cause structural
information loss and over-smoothing problem by generating excessive edges. To
solve this problem, we regulate edge sampling by adaptively determining node
degrees and considering the spatial distances between NWP grid points and
observations. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method by using
real-world atmospheric state and observation data from East Asia. Even in areas
with high atmospheric variability, the proposed method outperformed existing
STGNN models with and without structure learning.

TL;DR: GLiClass是一种新颖的分类方法，结合了高效性和灵活性，适用于零样本和小样本学习场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI系统需要高效且准确的分类方法，同时适应动态变化的用户需求，而现有方法在效率、灵活性或准确性上存在不足。

Method: 基于GLiNER架构改进的GLiClass方法，并采用近端策略优化（PPO）进行多标签文本分类训练。

Result: GLiClass在准确性和效率上与基于嵌入的方法相当，同时保持了零样本和小样本学习的灵活性。

Conclusion: GLiClass为解决分类任务中的效率、灵活性和准确性挑战提供了一种有效方案。

Abstract: Classification is one of the most widespread tasks in AI applications,
serving often as the first step in filtering, sorting, and categorizing data.
Since modern AI systems must handle large volumes of input data and early
pipeline stages can propagate errors downstream, achieving high efficiency and
accuracy is critical. Moreover, classification requirements can change
dynamically based on user needs, necessitating models with strong zero-shot
capabilities. While generative LLMs have become mainstream for zero-shot
classification due to their versatility, they suffer from inconsistent
instruction following and computational inefficiency. Cross-encoders, commonly
used as rerankers in RAG pipelines, face a different bottleneck: they must
process text-label pairs sequentially, significantly reducing efficiency with
large label sets. Embedding-based approaches offer good efficiency but struggle
with complex scenarios involving logical and semantic constraints. We propose
GLiClass, a novel method that adapts the GLiNER architecture for sequence
classification tasks. Our approach achieves strong accuracy and efficiency
comparable to embedding-based methods, while maintaining the flexibility needed
for zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios. Additionally, we adapted
proximal policy optimization (PPO) for multi-label text classification,
enabling training classifiers in data-sparse conditions or from human feedback.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常单独处理海事任务，难以全面考虑复杂情况，因此提出AIS-LLM以实现多任务集成分析。

Method: AIS-LLM包括时间序列编码器、LLM提示编码器、跨模态对齐模块和多任务解码器，实现端到端多任务处理。

Result: 实验表明AIS-LLM在各项任务中优于现有方法，并能生成综合情境摘要。

Conclusion: AIS-LLM为海事交通管理提供了更智能高效的解决方案。

Abstract: With the increase in maritime traffic and the mandatory implementation of the
Automatic Identification System (AIS), the importance and diversity of maritime
traffic analysis tasks based on AIS data, such as vessel trajectory prediction,
anomaly detection, and collision risk assessment, is rapidly growing. However,
existing approaches tend to address these tasks individually, making it
difficult to holistically consider complex maritime situations. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel framework, AIS-LLM, which integrates time-series
AIS data with a large language model (LLM). AIS-LLM consists of a Time-Series
Encoder for processing AIS sequences, an LLM-based Prompt Encoder, a
Cross-Modality Alignment Module for semantic alignment between time-series data
and textual prompts, and an LLM-based Multi-Task Decoder. This architecture
enables the simultaneous execution of three key tasks: trajectory prediction,
anomaly detection, and risk assessment of vessel collisions within a single
end-to-end system. Experimental results demonstrate that AIS-LLM outperforms
existing methods across individual tasks, validating its effectiveness.
Furthermore, by integratively analyzing task outputs to generate situation
summaries and briefings, AIS-LLM presents the potential for more intelligent
and efficient maritime traffic management.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于学习的语义缓存淘汰框架，解决了传统缓存方法无法处理语义相似性和未知系统参数的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的高推理成本带来了可扩展性和可持续性挑战，传统缓存方法无法有效处理语义相似性，且系统参数未知。

Method: 提出了一种基于学习的框架，包括离线优化和在线学习变体，并开发了高效算法。

Result: 在合成数据集上的实验表明，所提算法性能优于或匹配基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为解决语义缓存淘汰问题提供了理论基础和实用方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing how users interact with
information systems, yet their high inference cost poses serious scalability
and sustainability challenges. Caching inference responses, allowing them to be
retrieved without another forward pass through the LLM, has emerged as one
possible solution. Traditional exact-match caching, however, overlooks the
semantic similarity between queries, leading to unnecessary recomputation.
Semantic caching addresses this by retrieving responses based on semantic
similarity, but introduces a fundamentally different cache eviction problem:
one must account for mismatch costs between incoming queries and cached
responses. Moreover, key system parameters, such as query arrival probabilities
and serving costs, are often unknown and must be learned over time. Existing
semantic caching methods are largely ad-hoc, lacking theoretical foundations
and unable to adapt to real-world uncertainty. In this paper, we present a
principled, learning-based framework for semantic cache eviction under unknown
query and cost distributions. We formulate both offline optimization and online
learning variants of the problem, and develop provably efficient algorithms
with state-of-the-art guarantees. We also evaluate our framework on a synthetic
dataset, showing that our proposed algorithms perform matching or superior
performance compared with baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种社交感知的联邦学习隐私保护机制，通过多跳传播模型量化间接隐私泄露，并采用Stackelberg博弈优化激励策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中因社交网络连接导致的隐私外部性问题，即隐私泄露不仅取决于自身策略，还受他人决策影响。

Method: 设计了两阶段Stackelberg博弈，服务器优化激励策略，客户端选择隐私预算；引入均值场估计器近似外部隐私风险。

Result: 理论证明了均值场估计器的收敛性及Stackelberg纳什均衡的存在性，实验显示该方法显著提升客户端效用并降低服务器成本。

Conclusion: 该机制在保持模型性能的同时，实现了近似最优的社会福利，优于社交无关基线和其他考虑社交外部性的方法。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients without sharing local data, thereby enhancing privacy and
facilitating collaboration among clients connected via social networks.
However, these social connections introduce privacy externalities: a client's
privacy loss depends not only on its privacy protection strategy but also on
the privacy decisions of others, propagated through the network via multi-hop
interactions. In this work, we propose a socially-aware privacy-preserving FL
mechanism that systematically quantifies indirect privacy leakage through a
multi-hop propagation model. We formulate the server-client interaction as a
two-stage Stackelberg game, where the server, as the leader, optimizes
incentive policies, and clients, as followers, strategically select their
privacy budgets, which determine their privacy-preserving levels by controlling
the magnitude of added noise. To mitigate information asymmetry in networked
privacy estimation, we introduce a mean-field estimator to approximate the
average external privacy risk. We theoretically prove the existence and
convergence of the fixed point of the mean-field estimator and derive
closed-form expressions for the Stackelberg Nash Equilibrium. Despite being
designed from a client-centric incentive perspective, our mechanism achieves
approximately-optimal social welfare, as revealed by Price of Anarchy (PoA)
analysis. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves client utilities and reduces server costs while
maintaining model performance, outperforming both Social-Agnostic (SA)
baselines and methods that account for social externalities.

Result: 在两个公开数据集和一个私有数据集上验证，MORE-CLEAR显著提升生存率和策略性能。

Conclusion: 首次在医疗应用中利用语言模型和多模态离线强化学习，有望优化脓毒症治疗。

Abstract: Sepsis, a life-threatening inflammatory response to infection, causes organ
dysfunction, making early detection and optimal management critical. Previous
reinforcement learning (RL) approaches to sepsis management rely primarily on
structured data, such as lab results or vital signs, and on a dearth of a
comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition. In this work, we
propose a Multimodal Offline REinforcement learning for Clinical notes
Leveraged Enhanced stAte Representation (MORE-CLEAR) framework for sepsis
control in intensive care units. MORE-CLEAR employs pre-trained large-scale
language models (LLMs) to facilitate the extraction of rich semantic
representations from clinical notes, preserving clinical context and improving
patient state representation. Gated fusion and cross-modal attention allow
dynamic weight adjustment in the context of time and the effective integration
of multimodal data. Extensive cross-validation using two public (MIMIC-III and
MIMIC-IV) and one private dataset demonstrates that MORE-CLEAR significantly
improves estimated survival rate and policy performance compared to
single-modal RL approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first to leverage LLM
capabilities within a multimodal offline RL for better state representation in
medical applications. This approach can potentially expedite the treatment and
management of sepsis by enabling reinforcement learning models to propose
enhanced actions based on a more comprehensive understanding of patient
conditions.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a significant role in finance, energy,
meteorology, and IoT applications. Recent studies have leveraged the
generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adapt to time
series forecasting, achieving promising performance. However, existing studies
focus on token-level modal alignment, instead of bridging the intrinsic
modality gap between linguistic knowledge structures and time series data
patterns, greatly limiting the semantic representation. To address this issue,
we propose a novel Semantic-Enhanced LLM (SE-LLM) that explores the inherent
periodicity and anomalous characteristics of time series to embed into the
semantic space to enhance the token embedding. This process enhances the
interpretability of tokens for LLMs, thereby activating the potential of LLMs
for temporal sequence analysis. Moreover, existing Transformer-based LLMs excel
at capturing long-range dependencies but are weak at modeling short-term
anomalies in time-series data. Hence, we propose a plugin module embedded
within self-attention that models long-term and short-term dependencies to
effectively adapt LLMs to time-series analysis. Our approach freezes the LLM
and reduces the sequence dimensionality of tokens, greatly reducing
computational consumption. Experiments demonstrate the superiority performance
of our SE-LLM against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了神经网络训练扩展与能耗的复杂关系，为未来可持续AI研究提供了参考。

Abstract: The increasing demand for computational resources of training neural networks
leads to a concerning growth in energy consumption. While parallelization has
enabled upscaling model and dataset sizes and accelerated training, its impact
on energy consumption is often overlooked. To close this research gap, we
conducted scaling experiments for data-parallel training of two models,
ResNet50 and FourCastNet, and evaluated the impact of parallelization
parameters, i.e., GPU count, global batch size, and local batch size, on
predictive performance, training time, and energy consumption. We show that
energy consumption scales approximately linearly with the consumed resources,
i.e., GPU hours; however, the respective scaling factor differs substantially
between distinct model trainings and hardware, and is systematically influenced
by the number of samples and gradient updates per GPU hour. Our results shed
light on the complex interplay of scaling up neural network training and can
inform future developments towards more sustainable AI research.

Motivation: 现有ANN-to-SNN转换方法无法有效处理Transformer中的非线性操作且需额外微调，限制了Spiking Transformer的高效部署。

Method: 引入多基指数衰减（MBE）神经元，采用指数衰减策略和多基编码方法，无需修改预训练ANN的权重。

Result: 在多种任务和主流Transformer架构上实现近无损转换精度，显著降低延迟。

Conclusion: 为Spiking Transformer的高效和可扩展部署提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Leveraging the event-driven paradigm, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a
promising approach for constructing energy-efficient Transformer architectures.
Compared to directly trained Spiking Transformers, ANN-to-SNN conversion
methods bypass the high training costs. However, existing methods still suffer
from notable limitations, failing to effectively handle nonlinear operations in
Transformer architectures and requiring additional fine-tuning processes for
pre-trained ANNs. To address these issues, we propose a high-performance and
training-free ANN-to-SNN conversion framework tailored for Transformer
architectures. Specifically, we introduce a Multi-basis Exponential Decay (MBE)
neuron, which employs an exponential decay strategy and multi-basis encoding
method to efficiently approximate various nonlinear operations. It removes the
requirement for weight modifications in pre-trained ANNs. Extensive experiments
across diverse tasks (CV, NLU, NLG) and mainstream Transformer architectures
(ViT, RoBERTa, GPT-2) demonstrate that our method achieves near-lossless
conversion accuracy with significantly lower latency. This provides a promising
pathway for the efficient and scalable deployment of Spiking Transformers in
real-world applications.

Motivation: 深度神经网络会记忆损坏的标签，而现实数据集常受标签噪声和输入噪声影响，数据质量对模型性能至关重要。

Method: 计算每个样本对整体互信息的点贡献，贡献较低的样本可能为噪声或错误标签。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上验证，该方法有效过滤低质量样本，标签噪声下训练高互信息样本使分类准确率提升15%。

Conclusion: 该方法对良性输入修改具有鲁棒性，能保留语义有效数据并过滤真正损坏的样本。

Abstract: Deep neural networks can memorize corrupted labels, making data quality
critical for model performance, yet real-world datasets are frequently
compromised by both label noise and input noise. This paper proposes a mutual
information-based framework for data selection under hybrid noise scenarios
that quantifies statistical dependencies between inputs and labels. We compute
each sample's pointwise contribution to the overall mutual information and find
that lower contributions indicate noisy or mislabeled instances. Empirical
validation on MNIST with different synthetic noise settings demonstrates that
the method effectively filters low-quality samples. Under label corruption,
training on high-MI samples improves classification accuracy by up to 15\%
compared to random sampling. Furthermore, the method exhibits robustness to
benign input modifications, preserving semantically valid data while filtering
truly corrupted samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的RL方法在无线通信网络中因信息丢失或延迟而无法实时感知环境状态变化，现有解决方案计算负担大且不够通用。

Method: HR3L包含编码环境状态的发送器和解码并执行动作的接收器，无需交换梯度信息，降低了通信开销。

Result: 实验表明HR3L在样本效率和适应不同通信场景（如丢包、延迟和容量限制）方面显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HR3L为在非理想通信条件下训练RL代理提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of training Reinforcement Learning (RL)
agents over communication networks. The RL paradigm requires the agent to
instantaneously perceive the state evolution to infer the effects of its
actions on the environment. This is impossible if the agent receives state
updates over lossy or delayed wireless systems and thus operates with partial
and intermittent information. In recent years, numerous frameworks have been
proposed to manage RL with imperfect feedback; however, they often offer
specific solutions with a substantial computational burden. To address these
limits, we propose a novel architecture, named Homomorphic Robust Remote
Reinforcement Learning (HR3L), that enables the training of remote RL agents
exchanging observations across a non-ideal wireless channel. HR3L considers two
units: the transmitter, which encodes meaningful representations of the
environment, and the receiver, which decodes these messages and performs
actions to maximize a reward signal. Importantly, HR3L does not require the
exchange of gradient information across the wireless channel, allowing for
quicker training and a lower communication overhead than state-of-the-art
solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that HR3L significantly outperforms
baseline methods in terms of sample efficiency and adapts to different

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TRGE的方法，通过动态扩展预训练模型和设计两级路由策略，解决了多领域持续学习中的灾难性遗忘和前瞻性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多领域持续学习面临任务间类别和分布变化的双重异质性，现有方法难以同时解决灾难性遗忘和前瞻性遗忘。

Method: TRGE方法动态扩展CLIP模型，为每个任务分配专家组，并设计两级路由策略（组内路由和组间路由）以优化任务协作。同时利用MLLM生成任务描述以识别任务标识符。

Result: 实验表明，TRGE在多种设置下优于其他先进方法，且训练参数更少。

Conclusion: TRGE通过动态扩展和路由策略，有效解决了多领域持续学习中的遗忘问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Multi-Domain Continual Learning (MDCL) acquires knowledge from sequential
tasks with shifting class sets and distribution. Despite the
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods can adapt for this dual
heterogeneity, they still suffer from catastrophic forgetting and forward
forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose a Two-Level Routing Grouped
Mixture-of-Experts (TRGE) method. Firstly, TRGE dynamically expands the
pre-trained CLIP model, assigning specific expert group for each task to
mitigate catastrophic forgetting. With the number of experts continually grows
in this process, TRGE maintains the static experts count within the group and
introduces the intra-group router to alleviate routing overfitting caused by
the increasing routing complexity. Meanwhile, we design an inter-group routing
policy based on task identifiers and task prototype distance, which dynamically
selects relevant expert groups and combines their outputs to enhance inter-task
collaboration. Secondly, to get the correct task identifiers, we leverage
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) which own powerful multimodal
comprehension capabilities to generate semantic task descriptions and recognize
the correct task identifier. Finally, to mitigate forward forgetting, we
dynamically fuse outputs for unseen samples from the frozen CLIP model and TRGE
adapter based on training progress, leveraging both pre-trained and learned
knowledge. Through extensive experiments across various settings, our method
outperforms other advanced methods with fewer trainable parameters.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了离线强化学习（RL）的理论与实践之间的桥梁，分析了理论条件对算法设计的启示及其局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线RL的目标是在不与环境交互的情况下优化固定数据集中的轨迹回报，但理论洞察与算法设计之间的结合仍具挑战性。

Method: 通过列举证明所需条件（如函数表示和数据覆盖假设）、分析反例以及讨论缓解挑战的技术，探讨离线RL的可行性条件。

Result: 研究发现某些情况下离线RL无法解决，揭示了算法的局限性，并强调了在条件不满足时需寻找新解决方案。

Conclusion: 理论条件不仅是证明的基础，还揭示了算法的局限性，提醒我们在条件不满足时需探索新方法。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to optimize the return given a fixed
dataset of agent trajectories without additional interactions with the
environment. While algorithm development has progressed rapidly, significant
theoretical advances have also been made in understanding the fundamental
challenges of offline RL. However, bridging these theoretical insights with
practical algorithm design remains an ongoing challenge. In this survey, we
explore key intuitions derived from theoretical work and their implications for
offline RL algorithms.
  We begin by listing the conditions needed for the proofs, including function
representation and data coverage assumptions. Function representation
conditions tell us what to expect for generalization, and data coverage
assumptions describe the quality requirement of the data. We then examine
counterexamples, where offline RL is not solvable without an impractically
large amount of data. These cases highlight what cannot be achieved for all
algorithms and the inherent hardness of offline RL. Building on techniques to
mitigate these challenges, we discuss the conditions that are sufficient for
offline RL. These conditions are not merely assumptions for theoretical proofs,
but they also reveal the limitations of these algorithms and remind us to
search for novel solutions when the conditions cannot be satisfied.

TL;DR: GRAO是一种结合SFT和RL优势的统一框架，通过多样本生成、组内相对优势权重和参考感知参数更新，显著提升了语言模型的对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SFT和RL在语言模型对齐中的局限性，SFT受限于离线策略轨迹，RL样本效率低且依赖高质量基础模型。

Method: 提出GRAO框架，包括多样本生成策略、组内相对优势权重损失和参考感知参数更新。

Result: 在复杂任务中，GRAO相比SFT、DPO、PPO和GRPO分别提升了57.70%、17.65%、7.95%和5.18%。

Conclusion: GRAO提供了理论支持和实证证据，证明其在语言模型能力进化中的高效性。

Abstract: Alignment methodologies have emerged as a critical pathway for enhancing
language model alignment capabilities. While SFT (supervised fine-tuning)
accelerates convergence through direct token-level loss intervention, its
efficacy is constrained by offline policy trajectory. In contrast,
RL(reinforcement learning) facilitates exploratory policy optimization, but
suffers from low sample efficiency and stringent dependency on high-quality
base models. To address these dual challenges, we propose GRAO (Group Relative
Alignment Optimization), a unified framework that synergizes the respective
strengths of SFT and RL through three key innovations: 1) A multi-sample
generation strategy enabling comparative quality assessment via reward
feedback; 2) A novel Group Direct Alignment Loss formulation leveraging
intra-group relative advantage weighting; 3) Reference-aware parameter updates
guided by pairwise preference dynamics. Our theoretical analysis establishes
GRAO's convergence guarantees and sample efficiency advantages over
conventional approaches. Comprehensive evaluations across complex human
alignment tasks demonstrate GRAO's superior performance, achieving
57.70\%,17.65\% 7.95\% and 5.18\% relative improvements over SFT, DPO, PPO and
GRPO baselines respectively. This work provides both a theoretically grounded
alignment framework and empirical evidence for efficient capability evolution
in language models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种稀疏概率图电路（SPGCs），解决了传统深度生成模型（DGMs）在概率推断上的不可解问题，同时降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DGMs因非线性结构导致概率推断不可解，而现有的PGCs虽解决了可解性问题，但其计算复杂度高（O(n^2)），限制了在大规模稀疏图上的应用。

Method: 引入稀疏概率图电路（SPGCs），直接操作稀疏图表示，将复杂度降至O(n + m)，适用于边数远小于节点平方的图。

Result: 实验表明，SPGCs在药物设计中保持了精确推断能力，提升了内存效率和推断速度，并在关键指标上匹配了不可解DGMs的性能。

Conclusion: SPGCs是一种高效且可解的生成模型，适用于稀疏图场景，解决了传统方法的可扩展性问题。

Abstract: Deep generative models (DGMs) for graphs achieve impressively high expressive
power thanks to very efficient and scalable neural networks. However, these
networks contain non-linearities that prevent analytical computation of many
standard probabilistic inference queries, i.e., these DGMs are considered
\emph{intractable}. While recently proposed Probabilistic Graph Circuits (PGCs)
address this issue by enabling \emph{tractable} probabilistic inference, they
operate on dense graph representations with $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ complexity for
graphs with $n$ nodes and \emph{$m$ edges}. To address this scalability issue,
we introduce Sparse PGCs, a new class of tractable generative models that
operate directly on sparse graph representation, reducing the complexity to
$\mathcal{O}(n + m)$, which is particularly beneficial for $m \ll n^2$. In the
context of de novo drug design, we empirically demonstrate that SPGCs retain
exact inference capabilities, improve memory efficiency and inference speed,
and match the performance of intractable DGMs in key metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PAMA的高效多目标对齐算法，用于解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在多目标优化中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于RLHF的对齐方法仅优化单一奖励函数，导致模型行为僵化，无法适应多样的人类偏好。多目标对齐（MOA）是解决这一问题的关键。

Method: 提出PAMA算法，将多目标RLHF转化为凸优化问题，显著降低计算复杂度（从O(n^2*d)降至O(n)）。

Result: PAMA在实验中表现出高效的多目标对齐能力，适用于不同规模的LLMs（125M至7B参数）。

Conclusion: PAMA为MOA问题提供了高效且理论可靠的解决方案，推动了LLMs在多样化实际场景中的应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications that require careful balancing of multiple, often conflicting,
objectives, such as informativeness versus conciseness, or helpfulness versus
creativity. However, current alignment methods, primarily based on RLHF,
optimize LLMs toward a single reward function, resulting in rigid behavior that
fails to capture the complexity and diversity of human preferences. This
limitation hinders the adaptability of LLMs to practical scenarios, making
multi-objective alignment (MOA) a critical yet underexplored area. To bridge
this gap, we propose Pareto Multi-Objective Alignment (PAMA), a principled and
computationally efficient algorithm designed explicitly for MOA in LLMs. In
contrast to computationally prohibitive multi-objective optimization (MOO)
methods, PAMA transforms multi-objective RLHF into a convex optimization with a
closed-form solution, significantly enhancing scalability. Traditional MOO
approaches suffer from prohibitive O(n^2*d) complexity, where d represents the
number of model parameters, typically in the billions for LLMs, rendering
direct optimization infeasible. PAMA reduces this complexity to O(n) where n is
the number of objectives, enabling optimization to be completed within
milliseconds. We provide theoretical guarantees that PAMA converges to a Pareto
stationary point, where no objective can be improved without degrading at least
one other. Extensive experiments across language models ranging from 125M to 7B
parameters demonstrate PAMA's robust and effective MOA capabilities, aligning
with its theoretical advantages. PAMA provides a highly efficient solution to
the MOA problem that was previously considered intractable, offering a
practical and theoretically grounded approach to aligning LLMs with diverse
human values, paving the way for versatile and adaptable real-world AI
deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖更强的大语言模型或过滤难题，限制了可扩展性和推理能力的提升。

Method: EvoCoT通过自生成和验证思维链轨迹，逐步缩短轨迹以扩展探索空间。

Result: 实验表明，EvoCoT能解决未解决问题，提升推理能力，且兼容多种强化学习微调方法。

Conclusion: EvoCoT为稀疏奖励下的推理能力提升提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) has become a promising
paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) to improve their
reasoning capability. However, when the rollout accuracy is low on hard
problems, the reward becomes sparse, limiting learning efficiency and causing
exploration bottlenecks. Existing approaches either rely on stronger LLMs for
distillation or filter out difficult problems, which limits scalability or
restricts reasoning improvement through exploration.
  We propose EvoCoT, a self-evolving curriculum learning framework based on
two-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning optimization. EvoCoT constrains the
exploration space by self-generating and verifying CoT trajectories, then
gradually shortens them to expand the space in a controlled way. This enables
LLMs to stably learn from initially unsolved hard problems under sparse
rewards. We apply EvoCoT to multiple LLM families, including Qwen, DeepSeek,
and Llama. Experiments show that EvoCoT enables LLMs to solve previously
unsolved problems, improves reasoning capability without external CoT
supervision, and is compatible with various RL fine-tuning methods. We release
the source code to support future research.

Method: 采用Real NVP神经网络架构和自注意力机制，结合Basilisk模拟器生成的数据，对比纯数据驱动和物理信息变体的训练策略。

Result: 物理信息的引入使最佳架构的平均相对误差降低了27.08%，在MPC框架中，PINN模型在控制精度和鲁棒性上表现更优。

Conclusion: PINNs显著提升了航天器姿态控制的性能，尤其在MPC框架中表现出更高的稳定性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Attitude control is a fundamental aspect of spacecraft operations. Model
Predictive Control (MPC) has emerged as a powerful strategy for these tasks,
relying on accurate models of the system dynamics to optimize control actions
over a prediction horizon. In scenarios where physics models are incomplete,
difficult to derive, or computationally expensive, machine learning offers a
flexible alternative by learning the system behavior directly from data.
However, purely data-driven models often struggle with generalization and
stability, especially when applied to inputs outside their training domain. To
address these limitations, we investigate the benefits of incorporating
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) into the learning of spacecraft
attitude dynamics, comparing their performance with that of purely data-driven
approaches. Using a Real-valued Non-Volume Preserving (Real NVP) neural network
architecture with a self-attention mechanism, we trained several models on
simulated data generated with the Basilisk simulator. Two training strategies
were considered: a purely data-driven baseline and a physics-informed variant
to improve robustness and stability. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion
of physics-based information significantly enhances the performance in terms of
the mean relative error of the best architectures found by 27.08%. These
advantages are particularly evident when the learned models are integrated into
an MPC framework, where PINN-based models consistently outperform their purely
data-driven counterparts in terms of control accuracy and robustness, yielding
improvements of up to 42.86% in performance stability error and increased
robustness-to-noise.

<details>

Motivation: 模拟器如AlphaFold在自然科学中取得了巨大成功，行为科学中也需要类似的参与者模拟器来加速实验设计和假设验证。

Method: 论文评估了基于大型语言模型（LLM）的Centaur，该模型通过160个人类实验数据微调，旨在模拟人类行为。

Result: Centaur在预测准确性上表现良好，但其生成行为与人类数据存在系统性差异。

Conclusion: Centaur是预测人类行为的重要一步，但尚未达到可靠参与者模拟器或准确认知模型的标准。

Abstract: Simulators have revolutionized scientific practice across the natural
sciences. By generating data that reliably approximate real-world phenomena,
they enable scientists to accelerate hypothesis testing and optimize
experimental designs. This is perhaps best illustrated by AlphaFold, a
Nobel-prize winning simulator in chemistry that predicts protein structures
from amino acid sequences, enabling rapid prototyping of molecular
interactions, drug targets, and protein functions. In the behavioral sciences,
a reliable participant simulator - a system capable of producing human-like
behavior across cognitive tasks - would represent a similarly transformative
advance. Recently, Binz et al. introduced Centaur, a large language model (LLM)
fine-tuned on human data from 160 experiments, proposing its use not only as a
model of cognition but also as a participant simulator for "in silico
prototyping of experimental studies", e.g., to advance automated cognitive
science. Here, we review the core criteria for a participant simulator and
assess how well Centaur meets them. Although Centaur demonstrates strong
predictive accuracy, its generative behavior - a critical criterion for a
participant simulator - systematically diverges from human data. This suggests
that, while Centaur is a significant step toward predicting human behavior, it
does not yet meet the standards of a reliable participant simulator or an
accurate model of cognition.

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了ScoreAug的有效性，显著提升了性能并缓解了过拟合问题。

Conclusion: ScoreAug不仅能够有效缓解过拟合，还能与传统数据增强技术结合，进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling.
However, this study confirms the existence of overfitting in diffusion model
training, particularly in data-limited regimes. To address this challenge, we
propose Score Augmentation (ScoreAug), a novel data augmentation framework
specifically designed for diffusion models. Unlike conventional augmentation
approaches that operate on clean data, ScoreAug applies transformations to
noisy data, aligning with the inherent denoising mechanism of diffusion.
Crucially, ScoreAug further requires the denoiser to predict the augmentation
of the original target. This design establishes an equivariant learning
objective, enabling the denoiser to learn scores across varied denoising
spaces, thereby realizing what we term score augmentation. We also
theoretically analyze the relationship between scores in different spaces under
general transformations. In experiments, we extensively validate ScoreAug on
multiple benchmarks including CIFAR-10, FFHQ, AFHQv2, and ImageNet, with
results demonstrating significant performance improvements over baselines.
Notably, ScoreAug effectively mitigates overfitting across diverse scenarios,
such as varying data scales and model capacities, while exhibiting stable
convergence properties. Another advantage of ScoreAug over standard data
augmentation lies in its ability to circumvent data leakage issues under
certain conditions. Furthermore, we show that ScoreAug can be synergistically
combined with traditional data augmentation techniques to achieve additional
performance gains.

Conclusion: 该框架通用性强，能有效适应非平稳环境中的模式变化。

Abstract: Time series forecasting poses significant challenges in non-stationary
environments where underlying patterns evolve over time. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that enhances deep neural network (DNN) performance
by leveraging specialized model adaptation and selection. Initially, a base DNN
is trained offline on historical time series data. A reserved validation subset
is then segmented to extract and cluster the most dominant patterns within the
series, thereby identifying distinct regimes. For each identified cluster, the
base DNN is fine-tuned to produce a specialized version that captures unique
pattern characteristics. At inference, the most recent input is matched against
the cluster centroids, and the corresponding fine-tuned version is deployed
based on the closest similarity measure. Additionally, our approach integrates
a concept drift detection mechanism to identify and adapt to emerging patterns
caused by non-stationary behavior. The proposed framework is generalizable
across various DNN architectures and has demonstrated significant performance
gains on both traditional DNNs and recent advanced architectures implemented in
the GluonTS library.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类算法假设所有特征对数据结构的贡献均等，但在高维或噪声场景下不成立。现有特征加权方法需要额外参数调优，SHARK旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SHARK利用Shapley值量化特征相关性，将k均值目标分解为各特征的Shapley值之和，通过迭代重新加权特征，突出重要维度并抑制无关维度。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，SHARK表现优于现有方法，具有更高的鲁棒性和准确性，尤其在噪声场景下。

Conclusion: SHARK为无监督特征相关性提供了理论基础，并通过高效计算实现了性能提升，适用于高维和噪声数据。

Abstract: Clustering algorithms often assume all features contribute equally to the
data structure, an assumption that usually fails in high-dimensional or noisy
settings. Feature weighting methods can address this, but most require
additional parameter tuning. We propose SHARK (Shapley Reweighted $k$-means), a
feature-weighted clustering algorithm motivated by the use of Shapley values
from cooperative game theory to quantify feature relevance, which requires no
additional parameters beyond those in $k$-means. We prove that the $k$-means
objective can be decomposed into a sum of per-feature Shapley values, providing
an axiomatic foundation for unsupervised feature relevance and reducing Shapley
computation from exponential to polynomial time. SHARK iteratively re-weights
features by the inverse of their Shapley contribution, emphasising informative
dimensions and down-weighting irrelevant ones. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world data sets show that SHARK consistently matches or outperforms
existing methods, achieving superior robustness and accuracy, particularly in
scenarios where noise may be present. Software:

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a prominent
paradigm for training large language models and multimodal systems. Despite
notable advances enabled by existing RLHF training frameworks, significant
challenges remain in scaling to complex multimodal workflows and adapting to
dynamic workloads. In particular, current systems often encounter limitations
related to controller scalability when managing large models, as well as
inefficiencies in orchestrating intricate RLHF pipelines, especially in
scenarios that require dynamic sampling and resource allocation. In this paper,
we introduce WeChat-YATT (Yet Another Transformer Trainer in WeChat), a simple,
scalable, and balanced RLHF training framework specifically designed to address
these challenges. WeChat-YATT features a parallel controller programming model
that enables flexible and efficient orchestration of complex RLHF workflows,
effectively mitigating the bottlenecks associated with centralized controller
architectures and facilitating scalability in large-scale data scenarios. In
addition, we propose a dynamic placement schema that adaptively partitions
computational resources and schedules workloads, thereby significantly reducing
hardware idle time and improving GPU utilization under variable training
conditions. We evaluate WeChat-YATT across a range of experimental scenarios,
demonstrating that it achieves substantial improvements in throughput compared
to state-of-the-art RLHF training frameworks. Furthermore, WeChat-YATT has been
successfully deployed to train models supporting WeChat product features for a
large-scale user base, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in
real-world applications.

Abstract: Traffic state estimation (TSE) falls methodologically into three categories:
model-driven, data-driven, and model-data dual-driven. Model-driven TSE relies
on macroscopic traffic flow models originated from hydrodynamics. Data-driven
TSE leverages historical sensing data and employs statistical models or machine
learning methods to infer traffic state. Model-data dual-driven traffic state
estimation attempts to harness the strengths of both aspects to achieve more
accurate TSE. From the perspective of mathematical operator theory, TSE can be
viewed as a type of operator that maps available measurements of inerested
traffic state into unmeasured traffic state variables in real time. For the
first time this paper proposes to study real-time freeway TSE in the idea of
physics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet), which is an
operator-oriented architecture embedding traffic flow models based on deep
neural networks. The paper has developed an extended architecture from the
original PI-DeepONet. The extended architecture is featured with: (1) the
acceptance of 2-D data input so as to support CNN-based computations; (2) the
introduction of a nonlinear expansion layer, an attention mechanism, and a MIMO
mechanism; (3) dedicated neural network design for adaptive identification of
traffic flow model parameters. A traffic state estimator built on the basis of
this extended PI-DeepONet architecture was evaluated with respect to a short
freeway stretch of NGSIM and a large-scale urban expressway in China, along
with other four baseline TSE methods. The evaluation results demonstrated that
this novel TSE method outperformed the baseline methods with high-precision
estimation results of flow and mean speed.

Conclusion: 双通道架构和图神经网络在组合算法选择中具有潜力。

Abstract: Extensive experiments and prior studies show that no single maximum clique
algorithm consistently performs best across all instances, highlighting the
importance of selecting suitable algorithms based on instance features. Through
an extensive analysis of relevant studies, it is found that there is a lack of
research work concerning algorithm selection oriented toward the Maximum Clique
Problem (MCP). In this work, we propose a learning-based framework that
integrates both traditional machine learning and graph neural networks to
address this gap. We construct a labeled dataset by running four exact MCP
algorithms on a diverse collection of graph instances, accompanied by
structural and global statistical features extracted from each graph. We first
evaluate four conventional classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random
Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), across multiple
dataset variants. Experimental results show that RF consistently shows strong
performance across metrics and dataset variants, making it a reliable baseline.
In addition, feature importance analysis indicates that connectivity and
topological structure are strong predictors of algorithm performance. Building
on these findings, we develop a dual-channel model named GAT-MLP, which
combines a Graph Attention Network (GAT) for local structural encoding with a
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for global feature modeling. The GAT-MLP model
shows strong and consistent performance across all metrics. Our results
highlight the effectiveness of dual-channel architectures and the promise of
graph neural networks in combinatorial algorithm selection.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在减少通信开销的同时，无需额外资源获取信道状态信息。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging learning framework that enables edge
devices to collaboratively train ML models without sharing their local data. FL
faces, however, a significant challenge due to the high amount of information
that must be exchanged between the devices and the aggregator in the training
phase, which can exceed the limited capacity of wireless systems. In this
paper, two communication-efficient FL methods are considered where
communication overhead is reduced by communicating scalar values instead of
long vectors and by allowing high number of users to send information
simultaneously. The first approach employs a zero-order optimization technique
with two-point gradient estimator, while the second involves a first-order
gradient computation strategy. The novelty lies in leveraging channel
information in the learning algorithms, eliminating hence the need for
additional resources to acquire channel state information (CSI) and to remove
its impact, as well as in considering asynchronous devices. We provide a
rigorous analytical framework for the two methods, deriving convergence
guarantees and establishing appropriate performance bounds.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于迁移学习的预测性流程监控（PPM）技术，帮助缺乏足够事件数据或资源的组织实现有效的决策支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PPM技术需要大量事件数据或其他资源，限制了部分组织使用PPM的能力。本文旨在通过迁移学习解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于迁移学习的PPM技术，并在两个真实案例中实例化，通过数值实验验证其有效性。

Result: 实验结果表明，可以将一个业务流程的知识迁移到相似流程中，实现目标环境下的有效PPM。

Conclusion: 该技术使组织能够在内部和跨组织环境中利用迁移学习，共享预训练模型等资源。

Abstract: Event logs reflect the behavior of business processes that are mapped in
organizational information systems. Predictive process monitoring (PPM)
transforms these data into value by creating process-related predictions that
provide the insights required for proactive interventions at process runtime.
Existing PPM techniques require sufficient amounts of event data or other
relevant resources that might not be readily available, preventing some
organizations from utilizing PPM. The transfer learning-based PPM technique
presented in this paper allows organizations without suitable event data or
other relevant resources to implement PPM for effective decision support. The
technique is instantiated in two real-life use cases, based on which numerical
experiments are performed using event logs for IT service management processes
in an intra- and inter-organizational setting. The results of the experiments
suggest that knowledge of one business process can be transferred to a similar
business process in the same or a different organization to enable effective
PPM in the target context. With the proposed technique, organizations can
benefit from transfer learning in an intra- and inter-organizational setting,
where resources like pre-trained models are transferred within and across
organizational boundaries.

Abstract: Accurate power consumption prediction is crucial for improving efficiency and
reducing environmental impact, yet traditional methods relying on specialized
instruments or rigid physical models are impractical for large-scale,
real-world deployment. This study introduces a scalable data-driven method
using powertrain dynamic feature sets and both traditional machine learning and
deep neural networks to estimate instantaneous and cumulative power consumption
in internal combustion engine (ICE), electric vehicle (EV), and hybrid electric
vehicle (HEV) platforms. ICE models achieved high instantaneous accuracy with
mean absolute error and root mean squared error on the order of $10^{-3}$, and
cumulative errors under 3%. Transformer and long short-term memory models
performed best for EVs and HEVs, with cumulative errors below 4.1% and 2.1%,
respectively. Results confirm the approach's effectiveness across vehicles and
models. Uncertainty analysis revealed greater variability in EV and HEV
datasets than ICE, due to complex power management, emphasizing the need for
robust models for advanced powertrains.

Conclusion: 揭示了基于提示的联邦学习在实际部署中的安全隐患，呼吁对其鲁棒性进行更深入的研究。

Abstract: Prompt-based tuning has emerged as a lightweight alternative to full
fine-tuning in large vision-language models, enabling efficient adaptation via
learned contextual prompts. This paradigm has recently been extended to
federated learning settings (e.g., PromptFL), where clients collaboratively
train prompts under data privacy constraints. However, the security
implications of prompt-based aggregation in federated multimodal learning
remain largely unexplored, leaving a critical attack surface unaddressed. In
this paper, we introduce \textbf{BadPromptFL}, the first backdoor attack
targeting prompt-based federated learning in multimodal contrastive models. In
BadPromptFL, compromised clients jointly optimize local backdoor triggers and
prompt embeddings, injecting poisoned prompts into the global aggregation
process. These prompts are then propagated to benign clients, enabling
universal backdoor activation at inference without modifying model parameters.
Leveraging the contextual learning behavior of CLIP-style architectures,
BadPromptFL achieves high attack success rates (e.g., \(>90\%\)) with minimal
visibility and limited client participation. Extensive experiments across
multiple datasets and aggregation protocols validate the effectiveness,
stealth, and generalizability of our attack, raising critical concerns about
the robustness of prompt-based federated learning in real-world deployments.

Conclusion: CLEMC揭示了持续学习中稳定性与可塑性平衡的动态特性，为未来研究提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The stability-plasticity dilemma, closely related to a neural network's (NN)
capacity-its ability to represent tasks-is a fundamental challenge in continual
learning (CL). Within this context, we introduce CL's effective model capacity
(CLEMC) that characterizes the dynamic behavior of the stability-plasticity
balance point. We develop a difference equation to model the evolution of the
interplay between the NN, task data, and optimization procedure. We then
leverage CLEMC to demonstrate that the effective capacity-and, by extension,
the stability-plasticity balance point is inherently non-stationary. We show
that regardless of the NN architecture or optimization method, a NN's ability
to represent new tasks diminishes when incoming task distributions differ from
previous ones. We conduct extensive experiments to support our theoretical
findings, spanning a range of architectures-from small feedforward network and
convolutional networks to medium-sized graph neural networks and
transformer-based large language models with millions of parameters.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning for LLM reasoning has rapidly emerged as a prominent
research area, marked by a significant surge in related studies on both
algorithmic innovations and practical applications. Despite this progress,
several critical challenges remain, including the absence of standardized
guidelines for employing RL techniques and a fragmented understanding of their
underlying mechanisms. Additionally, inconsistent experimental settings,
variations in training data, and differences in model initialization have led
to conflicting conclusions, obscuring the key characteristics of these
techniques and creating confusion among practitioners when selecting
appropriate techniques. This paper systematically reviews widely adopted RL
techniques through rigorous reproductions and isolated evaluations within a
unified open-source framework. We analyze the internal mechanisms, applicable
scenarios, and core principles of each technique through fine-grained
experiments, including datasets of varying difficulty, model sizes, and
architectures. Based on these insights, we present clear guidelines for
selecting RL techniques tailored to specific setups, and provide a reliable
roadmap for practitioners navigating the RL for the LLM domain. Finally, we
reveal that a minimalist combination of two techniques can unlock the learning
capability of critic-free policies using vanilla PPO loss. The results
demonstrate that our simple combination consistently improves performance,
surpassing strategies like GRPO and DAPO.

Abstract: Connecting an ever-expanding catalogue of products with suitable

benchmark of bipartite and heterogeneous multimodal supply-chain graphs linking
8,888 manufacturers, over 70k products, more than 110k manufacturer-product
edges, and over 29k product images. Building on this benchmark, we propose the

aligns and aggregates textual and visual attributes into intermediate group
embeddings, then propagates them through a manufacturer-product hetero-graph
via multiscale message passing to enhance link prediction accuracy. C-MAG also
provides practical guidelines for modality-aware fusion, preserving predictive
performance in noisy, real-world settings.

Motivation: 传统逻辑优化操作计算成本高，且98%的切割尝试失败，需减少无效操作。

Method: 利用分类器预判并剪枝无效切割，避免不必要的重综合操作。

Result: 在EPFL基准套件和10个大型工业设计上，速度提升3.9倍。

Conclusion: 分类器预剪枝方法显著提升逻辑优化效率。

Abstract: In electronic design automation, logic optimization operators play a crucial
role in minimizing the gate count of logic circuits. However, their computation
demands are high. Operators such as refactor conventionally form iterative cuts
for each node, striving for a more compact representation - a task which often
fails 98% on average. Prior research has sought to mitigate computational cost
through parallelization. In contrast, our approach leverages a classifier to
prune unsuccessful cuts preemptively, thus eliminating unnecessary resynthesis
operations. Experiments on the refactor operator using the EPFL benchmark suite
and 10 large industrial designs demonstrate that this technique can speedup
logic optimization by 3.9x on average compared with the state-of-the-art ABC
implementation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前符号回归（SR）主要用于预测结果的平均值，但缺乏对其他分布点（如中位数或极值）的预测方法，而这对高风险应用至关重要。

Method: 提出符号分位数回归（SQR），扩展SR以预测条件分位数。

Result: SQR在透明模型中表现优异，与黑盒基线相当，同时保持透明性。

Conclusion: SQR适用于预测条件分位数，并能解释不同分位数下的特征影响。

Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) is a well-established framework for generating
interpretable or white-box predictive models. Although SR has been successfully
applied to create interpretable estimates of the average of the outcome, it is
currently not well understood how it can be used to estimate the relationship
between variables at other points in the distribution of the target variable.
Such estimates of e.g. the median or an extreme value provide a fuller picture
of how predictive variables affect the outcome and are necessary in
high-stakes, safety-critical application domains. This study introduces
Symbolic Quantile Regression (SQR), an approach to predict conditional
quantiles with SR. In an extensive evaluation, we find that SQR outperforms
transparent models and performs comparably to a strong black-box baseline
without compromising transparency. We also show how SQR can be used to explain
differences in the target distribution by comparing models that predict extreme
and central outcomes in an airline fuel usage case study. We conclude that SQR
is suitable for predicting conditional quantiles and understanding interesting
feature influences at varying quantiles.

Conclusion: PE-FNO为实时电池管理提供了高速度、高保真度的解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable digital twins of lithium-ion batteries must achieve high physical
fidelity with sub-millisecond speed. In this work, we benchmark three
operator-learning surrogates for the Single Particle Model (SPM): Deep Operator
Networks (DeepONets), Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) and a newly proposed
parameter-embedded Fourier Neural Operator (PE-FNO), which conditions each
spectral layer on particle radius and solid-phase diffusivity. Models are
trained on simulated trajectories spanning four current families (constant,
triangular, pulse-train, and Gaussian-random-field) and a full range of
State-of-Charge (SOC) (0 % to 100 %). DeepONet accurately replicates
constant-current behaviour but struggles with more dynamic loads. The basic FNO
maintains mesh invariance and keeps concentration errors below 1 %, with
voltage mean-absolute errors under 1.7 mV across all load types. Introducing
parameter embedding marginally increases error, but enables generalisation to
varying radii and diffusivities. PE-FNO executes approximately 200 times faster
than a 16-thread SPM solver. Consequently, PE-FNO's capabilities in inverse
tasks are explored in a parameter estimation task with Bayesian optimisation,
recovering anode and cathode diffusivities with 1.14 % and 8.4 % mean absolute
percentage error, respectively, and 0.5918 percentage points higher error in
comparison with classical methods. These results pave the way for neural
operators to meet the accuracy, speed and parametric flexibility demands of
real-time battery management, design-of-experiments and large-scale inference.
PE-FNO outperforms conventional neural surrogates, offering a practical path
towards high-speed and high-fidelity electrochemical digital twins.

Abstract: Reliable indoor navigation remains a significant challenge in complex

framework first conducts a binary occupancy matrix from a given indoor map.
Using this matrix, the A* algorithm computes the optimal path between origin

then transformed into natural language instructions by the SLM, enhancing
interpretability for end users. Experimental evaluations across various indoor
scenarios demonstrate the method's effectiveness in producing accurate and
timely navigation guidance. The results validate the proposed approach as a

Abstract: Indoor navigation remains a complex challenge due to the absence of reliable

This study presents an indoor localization and navigation approach that
integrates vision-based localization with large language model (LLM)-based
navigation. The localization system utilizes a ResNet-50 convolutional neural

using smartphone camera input. To complement localization, the navigation
module employs an LLM, guided by a carefully crafted system prompt, to
interpret preprocessed floor plan images and generate step-by-step directions.
Experimental evaluation was conducted in a realistic office corridor with
repetitive features and limited visibility to test localization robustness. The
model achieved high confidence and an accuracy of 96% across all tested
waypoints, even under constrained viewing conditions and short-duration
queries. Navigation tests using ChatGPT on real building floor maps yielded an
average instruction accuracy of 75%, with observed limitations in zero-shot

scalable, infrastructure-free indoor navigation using off-the-shelf cameras and
publicly available floor plans, particularly in resource-constrained settings

Conclusion: memoryKT通过完整记忆周期建模和个性化遗忘机制，提升了知识追踪的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) is committed to capturing students' knowledge mastery
from their historical interactions. Simulating students' memory states is a
promising approach to enhance both the performance and interpretability of
knowledge tracing models. Memory consists of three fundamental processes:
encoding, storage, and retrieval. Although forgetting primarily manifests
during the storage stage, most existing studies rely on a single,
undifferentiated forgetting mechanism, overlooking other memory processes as
well as personalized forgetting patterns. To address this, this paper proposes
memoryKT, a knowledge tracing model based on a novel temporal variational
autoencoder. The model simulates memory dynamics through a three-stage process:
(i) Learning the distribution of students' knowledge memory features, (ii)
Reconstructing their exercise feedback, while (iii) Embedding a personalized
forgetting module within the temporal workflow to dynamically modulate memory
storage strength. This jointly models the complete encoding-storage-retrieval
cycle, significantly enhancing the model's perception capability for individual
differences. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our
proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Large-scale models pre-trained on Electroencephalography (EEG) have shown
promise in clinical applications such as neurological disorder detection.
However, the practical deployment of EEG-based large-scale models faces
critical challenges such as limited labeled EEG data and suboptimal performance
in clinical scenarios. To address these issues, we propose NeuroDx-LM, a novel
large-scale model specifically designed for detecting EEG-based neurological
disorders. Our key contributions include (i) a Selective Temporal-Frequency
Embedding mechanism that adaptively captures complex temporal and spectral
patterns in EEG signals; and (ii) a Progressive Feature-Aware Training strategy
that refines feature representation in a two-stage process. In the first stage,
our model learns the fundamental discriminative features of EEG activities; in
the second stage, the model further extracts more specialized fine-grained
features for accurate diagnostic performance. We evaluated NeuroDx-LM on the
CHB-MIT and Schizophrenia datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in
EEG-based seizure and schizophrenia detection, respectively. These results
demonstrate the great potential of EEG-based large-scale models to advance
clinical applicability. Our code is available at

Abstract: In the active learning paradigm, using an oracle to label data has always
been a complex and expensive task, and with the emersion of large unlabeled
data pools, it would be highly beneficial If we could achieve better results
without relying on an oracle. This research introduces OFAL, an oracle-free
active learning scheme that utilizes neural network uncertainty. OFAL uses the
model's own uncertainty to transform highly confident unlabeled samples into
informative uncertain samples. First, we start with separating and quantifying
different parts of uncertainty and introduce Monte Carlo Dropouts as an
approximation of the Bayesian Neural Network model. Secondly, by adding a
variational autoencoder, we go on to generate new uncertain samples by stepping
toward the uncertain part of latent space starting from a confidence seed
sample. By generating these new informative samples, we can perform active
learning and enhance the model's accuracy. Lastly, we try to compare and
integrate our method with other widely used active learning sampling methods.

Abstract: Conducting a comprehensive literature review is crucial for advancing circuit
design methodologies. However, the rapid influx of state-of-the-art research,
inconsistent data representation, and the complexity of optimizing circuit
design objectives make this task significantly challenging. In this paper, we
propose MuaLLM, an open-source multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) agent for
circuit design assistance that integrates a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) framework with an adaptive vector database of circuit design
research papers. Unlike conventional LLMs, the MuaLLM agent employs a Reason +
Act (ReAct) workflow for iterative reasoning, goal-setting, and multi-step
information retrieval. It functions as a question-answering design assistant,
capable of interpreting complex queries and providing reasoned responses
grounded in circuit literature. Its multimodal capabilities enable processing
of both textual and visual data, facilitating more efficient and comprehensive
analysis. The system dynamically adapts using intelligent search tools,
automated document retrieval from the internet, and real-time database updates.
Unlike conventional approaches constrained by model context limits, MuaLLM
decouples retrieval from inference, enabling scalable reasoning over
arbitrarily large corpora. At the maximum context length supported by standard
LLMs, MuaLLM remains up to 10x less costly and 1.6x faster while maintaining
the same accuracy. This allows rapid, no-human-in-the-loop database generation,
overcoming the bottleneck of simulation-based dataset creation for circuits. To
evaluate MuaLLM, we introduce two custom datasets: RAG-250, targeting retrieval
and citation performance, and Reasoning-100 (Reas-100), focused on multistep
reasoning in circuit design. MuaLLM achieves 90.1% recall on RAG-250, and 86.8%
accuracy on Reas-100.

TL;DR: FairFLRep是一种自动化的公平性感知故障定位和修复技术，用于识别和修正DNN分类器中可能导致偏见的神经元。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNN在高风险决策应用中可能因训练数据中的偏见而产生不公平行为，现有方法难以有效识别和修正这些偏见。

Method: FairFLRep通过调整与敏感属性（如种族或性别）相关的神经元权重，分析网络输入输出关系，修正导致预测质量差异的神经元。

Result: 在多个数据集和DNN模型上的实验表明，FairFLRep在提升公平性的同时保持了准确性，且效率高于基线方法。

Conclusion: FairFLRep在公平性故障定位和修复阶段均表现出色，为DNN的公平性修正提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are being utilized in various aspects of our
daily lives, including high-stakes decision-making applications that impact
individuals. However, these systems reflect and amplify bias from the data used
during training and testing, potentially resulting in biased behavior and
inaccurate decisions. For instance, having different misclassification rates
between white and black sub-populations. However, effectively and efficiently
identifying and correcting biased behavior in DNNs is a challenge. This paper
introduces FairFLRep, an automated fairness-aware fault localization and repair
technique that identifies and corrects potentially bias-inducing neurons in DNN
classifiers. FairFLRep focuses on adjusting neuron weights associated with
sensitive attributes, such as race or gender, that contribute to unfair
decisions. By analyzing the input-output relationships within the network,
FairFLRep corrects neurons responsible for disparities in predictive quality
parity. We evaluate FairFLRep on four image classification datasets using two
DNN classifiers, and four tabular datasets with a DNN model. The results show
that FairFLRep consistently outperforms existing methods in improving fairness
while preserving accuracy. An ablation study confirms the importance of
considering fairness during both fault localization and repair stages. Our
findings also show that FairFLRep is more efficient than the baseline
approaches in repairing the network.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了使用联邦学习（FL）在癫痫发作预测中的隐私保护方法，提出随机子集聚合策略以解决数据异质性问题，显著提升了模型在代表性不足数据集上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于患者隐私法规和数据异质性（非独立同分布特性），开发跨多个临床站点的癫痫发作预测模型面临挑战。联邦学习提供了一种隐私保护的协作训练框架，但标准聚合方法（如FedAvg）在异质环境中可能受主导数据集影响而产生偏差。

Method: 本文采用单通道EEG数据，在四个公共数据集（Siena、CHB-MIT、Helsinki、NCH）上实现隐私保护的全局归一化，并提出随机子集聚合策略，确保每个客户端在每轮训练中使用固定大小的随机子集，以实现公平聚合。

Result: 标准加权FedAvg在异质数据集中表现不均衡（如CHB-MIT准确率89.0%，但Helsinki和NCH仅50.8%和50.6%）。随机子集聚合显著提升了代表性不足客户端的性能（Helsinki准确率提升至81.7%，NCH至68.7%），并实现了77.1%的宏平均准确率和80.0%的总体准确率。

Conclusion: 随机子集聚合策略在异质多医院环境中构建了更鲁棒且公平的癫痫发作预测模型，同时保护了数据隐私，展示了平衡联邦学习方法在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Developing accurate and generalizable epileptic seizure prediction models
from electroencephalography (EEG) data across multiple clinical sites is
hindered by patient privacy regulations and significant data heterogeneity
(non-IID characteristics). Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving
framework for collaborative training, but standard aggregation methods like
Federated Averaging (FedAvg) can be biased by dominant datasets in
heterogeneous settings. This paper investigates FL for seizure prediction using
a single EEG channel across four diverse public datasets (Siena, CHB-MIT,
Helsinki, NCH), representing distinct patient populations (adult, pediatric,
neonate) and recording conditions. We implement privacy-preserving global
normalization and propose a Random Subset Aggregation strategy, where each
client trains on a fixed-size random subset of its data per round, ensuring
equal contribution during aggregation. Our results show that locally trained
models fail to generalize across sites, and standard weighted FedAvg yields
highly skewed performance (e.g., 89.0% accuracy on CHB-MIT but only 50.8% on
Helsinki and 50.6% on NCH). In contrast, Random Subset Aggregation
significantly improves performance on under-represented clients (accuracy
increases to 81.7% on Helsinki and 68.7% on NCH) and achieves a superior
macro-average accuracy of 77.1% and pooled accuracy of 80.0% across all sites,
demonstrating a more robust and fair global model. This work highlights the
potential of balanced FL approaches for building effective and generalizable
seizure prediction systems in realistic, heterogeneous multi-hospital
environments while respecting data privacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络缺乏可解释性，而逻辑神经网络可以通过AND和OR操作学习输入与输出之间的逻辑关系。本文旨在通过引入NOT操作和偏差项，进一步提升其可解释性和实用性。

Method: 提出了一种广义化的逻辑网络，包含NOT操作和偏差项，并开发了严格的逻辑和概率模型。同时，设计了一种新的因子化IF-THEN规则结构和改进的学习算法。

Result: 该方法在布尔网络发现领域达到了最先进的性能，并在表格分类任务中学习到了相关且可解释的规则，特别是在医学领域具有实际价值。

Conclusion: 通过引入NOT操作和偏差项，该方法不仅提升了逻辑网络的可解释性，还在实际应用中展现了显著的优势。

Abstract: Traditional neural networks have an impressive classification performance,
but what they learn cannot be inspected, verified or extracted. Neural Logic
Networks on the other hand have an interpretable structure that enables them to
learn a logical mechanism relating the inputs and outputs with AND and OR
operations. We generalize these networks with NOT operations and biases that
take into account unobserved data and develop a rigorous logical and
probabilistic modeling in terms of concept combinations to motivate their use.
We also propose a novel factorized IF-THEN rule structure for the model as well
as a modified learning algorithm. Our method improves the state-of-the-art in
Boolean networks discovery and is able to learn relevant, interpretable rules
in tabular classification, notably on an example from the medical field where
interpretability has tangible value.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑机接口在个性化音乐干预中具有潜力，但由于EEG信号的个体差异和运动伪影等问题，其泛化能力受限。

Method: 提出ITSA预对齐策略，结合RCSP和黎曼几何的混合架构，并行和顺序配置提升分类性能。

Result: ITSA在跨主体和条件下表现出显著性能提升，并行融合方法优于顺序方法。

Conclusion: ITSA为脑机接口的跨主体泛化提供了有效解决方案，代码将公开。

Abstract: Personalised music-based interventions offer a powerful means of supporting
motor rehabilitation by dynamically tailoring auditory stimuli to provide
external timekeeping cues, modulate affective states, and stabilise gait
patterns. Generalisable Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) thus hold promise for
adapting these interventions across individuals. However, inter-subject
variability in EEG signals, further compounded by movement-induced artefacts
and motor planning differences, hinders the generalisability of BCIs and
results in lengthy calibration processes. We propose Individual Tangent Space
Alignment (ITSA), a novel pre-alignment strategy incorporating subject-specific
recentering, distribution matching, and supervised rotational alignment to
enhance cross-subject generalisation. Our hybrid architecture fuses Regularised
Common Spatial Patterns (RCSP) with Riemannian geometry in parallel and
sequential configurations, improving class separability while maintaining the
geometric structure of covariance matrices for robust statistical computation.
Using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, `ITSA' demonstrates significant
performance improvements across subjects and conditions. The parallel fusion
approach shows the greatest enhancement over its sequential counterpart, with
robust performance maintained across varying data conditions and electrode
configurations. The code will be made publicly available at the time of
publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解Transformer如何通过训练获得多步推理能力，尤其是从理论角度分析其学习机制。

Method: 分析两个任务：反向推理（从目标节点到根节点的路径）和更复杂的前向推理（两阶段推理）。通过梯度下降动态理论分析单层Transformer的训练。

Result: 训练后的单层Transformer可以解决这两个任务，并具有对未见树的泛化能力。多阶段训练动态揭示了注意力头如何自主分工协作。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Transformer如何实现顺序算法程序，表明即使浅层多头Transformer也能通过结构化任务解决复杂问题。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in multi-step
reasoning tasks. However, understandings of the underlying mechanisms by which
they acquire these abilities through training remain limited, particularly from
a theoretical standpoint. This work investigates how transformers learn to
solve symbolic multi-step reasoning problems through chain-of-thought
processes, focusing on path-finding in trees. We analyze two intertwined tasks:
a backward reasoning task, where the model outputs a path from a goal node to
the root, and a more complex forward reasoning task, where the model implements
two-stage reasoning by first identifying the goal-to-root path and then
reversing it to produce the root-to-goal path. Our theoretical analysis,
grounded in the dynamics of gradient descent, shows that trained one-layer
transformers can provably solve both tasks with generalization guarantees to
unseen trees. In particular, our multi-phase training dynamics for forward
reasoning elucidate how different attention heads learn to specialize and
coordinate autonomously to solve the two subtasks in a single autoregressive
path. These results provide a mechanistic explanation of how trained
transformers can implement sequential algorithmic procedures. Moreover, they
offer insights into the emergence of reasoning abilities, suggesting that when
tasks are structured to take intermediate chain-of-thought steps, even shallow
multi-head transformers can effectively solve problems that would otherwise
require deeper architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征网格表示在3D场景重建和神经渲染中存在内存占用高的问题，限制了并行计算硬件的效率。

Method: 将可学习特征直接存储在网格顶点上，利用几何结构作为紧凑表示，结合任务特定的几何先验优化特征。

Result: 实验显示，内存消耗仅为基于网格表示的五分之一或更低，同时渲染质量相当且推理开销更低。

Conclusion: 神经顶点特征方法在内存效率和特征表示上优于传统网格表示，适用于神经渲染任务。

Abstract: Recent research on learnable neural representations has been widely adopted
in the field of 3D scene reconstruction and neural rendering applications.
However, traditional feature grid representations often suffer from substantial
memory footprint, posing a significant bottleneck for modern parallel computing
hardware. In this paper, we present neural vertex features, a generalized
formulation of learnable representation for neural rendering tasks involving
explicit mesh surfaces. Instead of uniformly distributing neural features
throughout 3D space, our method stores learnable features directly at mesh
vertices, leveraging the underlying geometry as a compact and structured
representation for neural processing. This not only optimizes memory
efficiency, but also improves feature representation by aligning compactly with
the surface using task-specific geometric priors. We validate our neural
representation across diverse neural rendering tasks, with a specific emphasis
on neural radiosity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces
memory consumption to only one-fifth (or even less) of grid-based
representations, while maintaining comparable rendering quality and lowering
inference overhead.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: LL3M是一个多智能体系统，利用预训练大语言模型（LLMs）通过编写可解释的Blender Python代码生成3D资产。与传统生成方法不同，它将形状生成重新定义为代码编写任务，提供更高的模块化、可编辑性和与艺术家工作流程的集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D生成方法依赖于大量3D数据学习，缺乏模块化和可编辑性。LL3M旨在通过代码生成实现更灵活、可解释的3D资产创建，并与人类工作流程无缝集成。

Method: LL3M协调多个专用LLM智能体，通过规划、检索、编写、调试和优化Blender脚本来生成和编辑几何与外观。系统利用BlenderRAG知识库增强代码正确性和建模能力。

Result: 实验表明，LL3M能生成多样化的3D形状、材质和场景，支持用户驱动的迭代优化，展示了代码作为生成媒介的强大能力。

Conclusion: LL3M证明了代码作为生成和解释3D资产的高效媒介，为智能体与人类协作提供了新范式。

Abstract: We present LL3M, a multi-agent system that leverages pretrained large
language models (LLMs) to generate 3D assets by writing interpretable Python
code in Blender. We break away from the typical generative approach that learns
from a collection of 3D data. Instead, we reformulate shape generation as a
code-writing task, enabling greater modularity, editability, and integration
with artist workflows. Given a text prompt, LL3M coordinates a team of
specialized LLM agents to plan, retrieve, write, debug, and refine Blender
scripts that generate and edit geometry and appearance. The generated code
works as a high-level, interpretable, human-readable, well-documented
representation of scenes and objects, making full use of sophisticated Blender
constructs (e.g. B-meshes, geometry modifiers, shader nodes) for diverse,
unconstrained shapes, materials, and scenes. This code presents many avenues
for further agent and human editing and experimentation via code tweaks or
procedural parameters. This medium naturally enables a co-creative loop in our
system: agents can automatically self-critique using code and visuals, while
iterative user instructions provide an intuitive way to refine assets. A shared
code context across agents enables awareness of previous attempts, and a
retrieval-augmented generation knowledge base built from Blender API
documentation, BlenderRAG, equips agents with examples, types, and functions
empowering advanced modeling operations and code correctness. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of LL3M across diverse shape categories, style and material
edits, and user-driven refinements. Our experiments showcase the power of code
as a generative and interpretable medium for 3D asset creation. Our project

Motivation: 从非结构化故事数据中提取结构化信息是挑战，LLM的文本处理能力为改进叙事可视化技术提供了机会。

Method: 提出LLM驱动的数据解析管道，自动提取叙事信息，并应用于Story Ribbons可视化系统。

Result: 在36部文学作品上验证了LLM简化叙事可视化创建的能力，并揭示了新见解。

Conclusion: LLM在叙事分析中具有潜力，但也存在局限性，需通过交互设计解决。

Abstract: Analyzing literature involves tracking interactions between characters,
locations, and themes. Visualization has the potential to facilitate the
mapping and analysis of these complex relationships, but capturing structured
information from unstructured story data remains a challenge. As large language
models (LLMs) continue to advance, we see an opportunity to use their text
processing and analysis capabilities to augment and reimagine existing
storyline visualization techniques. Toward this goal, we introduce an
LLM-driven data parsing pipeline that automatically extracts relevant narrative
information from novels and scripts. We then apply this pipeline to create
Story Ribbons, an interactive visualization system that helps novice and expert
literary analysts explore detailed character and theme trajectories at multiple
narrative levels. Through pipeline evaluations and user studies with Story
Ribbons on 36 literary works, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs to
streamline narrative visualization creation and reveal new insights about
familiar stories. We also describe current limitations of AI-based systems, and
interaction motifs designed to address these issues.

Motivation: 探索对话中隐藏的模式是否比文字本身更能揭示沟通的本质，尤其是在人类与AI对话日益增多的时代。

Method: 采用生物隐喻（如DNA结构）设计视觉语言，通过厚度、颜色、连接元素和螺旋模式等表示对话的复杂性、情感轨迹、相关性和主题连贯性。

Result: 在治疗对话和历史性人机对话的分析中，该方法成功揭示了传统方法遗漏的互动模式。

Conclusion: 为理解沟通提供了一个创新的框架，结合了数据可视化、人机交互和对话意义的探索。

Abstract: What if the patterns hidden within dialogue reveal more about communication
than the words themselves? We introduce Conversational DNA, a novel visual
language that treats any dialogue -- whether between humans, between human and
AI, or among groups -- as a living system with interpretable structure that can
be visualized, compared, and understood. Unlike traditional conversation
analysis that reduces rich interaction to statistical summaries, our approach
reveals the temporal architecture of dialogue through biological metaphors.
Linguistic complexity flows through strand thickness, emotional trajectories
cascade through color gradients, conversational relevance forms through
connecting elements, and topic coherence maintains structural integrity through
helical patterns. Through exploratory analysis of therapeutic conversations and
historically significant human-AI dialogues, we demonstrate how this
visualization approach reveals interaction patterns that traditional methods
miss. Our work contributes a new creative framework for understanding
communication that bridges data visualization, human-computer interaction, and
the fundamental question of what makes dialogue meaningful in an age where
humans increasingly converse with artificial minds.

Result: 用户更信任且偏好颜色编码设计，认为其更易于验证准确性。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM应用开发者提供了实用设计指南，旨在校准用户信任并提升用户对输出的审查能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to generating inaccurate or
false information, often referred to as "hallucinations" or "confabulations."
While several technical advancements have been made to detect hallucinated
content by assessing the factuality of the model's responses, there is still
limited research on how to effectively communicate this information to users.
To address this gap, we conducted two scenario-based experiments with a total
of 208 participants to systematically compare the effects of various design
strategies for communicating factuality scores by assessing participants'
ratings of trust, ease in validating response accuracy, and preference. Our
findings reveal that participants preferred and trusted a design in which all
phrases within a response were color-coded based on factuality scores.
Participants also found it easier to validate accuracy of the response in this
style compared to a baseline with no style applied. Our study offers practical
design guidelines for LLM application developers and designers, aimed at
calibrating user trust, aligning with user preferences, and enhancing users'
ability to scrutinize LLM outputs.

Result: 不透明和模糊策略在保持答案质量的同时提高了用户信任。

Conclusion: 隐藏或模糊不实内容有助于建立用户对AI的信任。

Abstract: Large language models are known to produce outputs that are plausible but
factually incorrect. To prevent people from making erroneous decisions by
blindly trusting AI, researchers have explored various ways of communicating
factuality estimates in AI-generated outputs to end-users. However, little is
known about whether revealing content estimated to be factually incorrect
influences users' trust when compared to hiding it altogether. We tested four
different ways of disclosing an AI-generated output with factuality
assessments: transparent (highlights less factual content), attention
(highlights factual content), opaque (removes less factual content), ambiguity
(makes less factual content vague), and compared them with a baseline response
without factuality information. We conducted a human subjects research (N =
148) using the strategies in question-answering scenarios. We found that the
opaque and ambiguity strategies led to higher trust while maintaining perceived
answer quality, compared to the other strategies. We discuss the efficacy of
hiding presumably less factual content to build end-user trust.

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注AI系统的设计和责任，以支持低资源场景的决策。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence researchers have proposed various data-driven
algorithms to improve the processes that match individuals experiencing
homelessness to scarce housing resources. It remains unclear whether and how
these algorithms are received or adopted by practitioners and what their
corresponding consequences are. Through semi-structured interviews with 13
policymakers in homeless services in Los Angeles, we investigate whether such
change-makers are open to the idea of integrating AI into the housing resource
matching process, identifying where they see potential gains and drawbacks from
such a system in issues of efficiency, fairness, and transparency. Our
qualitative analysis indicates that, even when aware of various complicating
factors, policymakers welcome the idea of an AI matching tool if thoughtfully
designed and used in tandem with human decision-makers. Though there is no
consensus as to the exact design of such an AI system, insights from
policymakers raise open questions and design considerations that can be
enlightening for future researchers and practitioners who aim to build
responsible algorithmic systems to support decision-making in low-resource

Conclusion: ClimateSOM通过结合SOM和LLMs，有效支持了气候集合数据的交互式探索和解释，专家评审验证了其实用性。

Abstract: Ensemble datasets are ever more prevalent in various scientific domains. In
climate science, ensemble datasets are used to capture variability in
projections under plausible future conditions including greenhouse and aerosol
emissions. Each ensemble model run produces projections that are fundamentally
similar yet meaningfully distinct. Understanding this variability among
ensemble model runs and analyzing its magnitude and patterns is a vital task
for climate scientists. In this paper, we present ClimateSOM, a visual analysis
workflow that leverages a self-organizing map (SOM) and Large Language Models
(LLMs) to support interactive exploration and interpretation of climate
ensemble datasets. The workflow abstracts climate ensemble model runs -
spatiotemporal time series - into a distribution over a 2D space that captures
the variability among the ensemble model runs using a SOM. LLMs are integrated
to assist in sensemaking of this SOM-defined 2D space, the basis for the visual
analysis tasks. In all, ClimateSOM enables users to explore the variability
among ensemble model runs, identify patterns, compare and cluster the ensemble
model runs. To demonstrate the utility of ClimateSOM, we apply the workflow to
an ensemble dataset of precipitation projections over California and the
Northwestern United States. Furthermore, we conduct a short evaluation of our
LLM integration, and conduct an expert review of the visual workflow and the
insights from the case studies with six domain experts to evaluate our approach
and its utility.

agency and control, large-scale generative models like text-to-image diffusion
systems often obscure these possibilities. We suggest that even large models
can be treated as creative materials if their internal structure is exposed and
manipulable. We propose a craft-based approach to explainability rooted in
long-term, hands-on engagement akin to Sch\"on's "reflection-in-action" and
demonstrate its application through a model-bending and inspection plugin
integrated into the node-based interface of ComfyUI. We demonstrate that by
interactively manipulating different parts of a generative model, artists can
develop an intuition about how each component influences the output.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索脑电图微状态与大语言模型的结合，以改进认知负荷状态的预测和理解。

Method: 分四阶段：数据收集与预处理、微状态分割与脑电图回拟合、特征提取与提示工程、模型选择与微调。

Result: 微调后模型性能显著提升，能准确区分认知负荷状态。

Conclusion: 该方法推动了认知神经科学与认知AI的研究，为机器学习技术在认知负荷领域的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: This study explores the intersection of electroencephalography (EEG)
microstates and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the assessment of
cognitive load states. By utilizing EEG microstate features, the research aims
to fine-tune LLMs for improved predictions of distinct cognitive states,
specifically 'Rest' and 'Load'. The experimental design is delineated in four
comprehensive stages: dataset collection and preprocessing, microstate
segmentation and EEG backfitting, feature extraction paired with prompt
engineering, and meticulous LLM model selection and refinement. Employing a
supervised learning paradigm, the LLM is trained to identify cognitive load
states based on EEG microstate features integrated into prompts, producing
accurate discrimination of cognitive load. A curated dataset, linking EEG
features to specified cognitive load conditions, underpins the experimental
framework. The results indicate a significant improvement in model performance
following the proposed fine-tuning, showcasing the potential of EEG-informed
LLMs in cognitive neuroscience and cognitive AI applications. This approach not
only contributes to the understanding of brain dynamics but also paves the way
for advancements in machine learning techniques applicable to cognitive load
and cognitive AI research.

TL;DR: Urbanite是一个基于人机协作的框架，旨在降低城市视觉分析的门槛，通过意图驱动的交互和数据流模型支持多阶段对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市数据分析复杂且需要多领域专业知识，现有方法对非技术用户不友好，大语言模型提供了降低门槛的机会，但意图与系统行为对齐存在挑战。

Method: 提出Urbanite框架，采用数据流模型支持多范围意图指定，并整合可解释性、多分辨率任务定义和交互溯源功能。

Result: 通过与城市专家合作的场景验证，Urbanite展示了其有效性。

Conclusion: Urbanite通过人机协作和数据流模型，有效解决了城市视觉分析中的意图对齐问题。

Abstract: With the growing availability of urban data and the increasing complexity of
societal challenges, visual analytics has become essential for deriving
insights into pressing real-world problems. However, analyzing such data is
inherently complex and iterative, requiring expertise across multiple domains.
The need to manage diverse datasets, distill intricate workflows, and integrate
various analytical methods presents a high barrier to entry, especially for
researchers and urban experts who lack proficiency in data management, machine
learning, and visualization. Advancements in large language models offer a
promising solution to lower the barriers to the construction of analytics
systems by enabling users to specify intent rather than define precise
computational operations. However, this shift from explicit operations to
intent-based interaction introduces challenges in ensuring alignment throughout
the design and development process. Without proper mechanisms, gaps can emerge
between user intent, system behavior, and analytical outcomes. To address these
challenges, we propose Urbanite, a framework for human-AI collaboration in
urban visual analytics. Urbanite leverages a dataflow-based model that allows
users to specify intent at multiple scopes, enabling interactive alignment
across the specification, process, and evaluation stages of urban analytics.
Based on findings from a survey to uncover challenges, Urbanite incorporates
features to facilitate explainability, multi-resolution definition of tasks
across dataflows, nodes, and parameters, while supporting the provenance of
interactions. We demonstrate Urbanite's effectiveness through usage scenarios
created in collaboration with urban experts. Urbanite is available at

Motivation: 现有研究对视觉分析系统的实际开发挑战探讨不足，缺乏结构化知识库指导设计。

Method: 提出VA-Blueprint方法，通过系统化审查和分类城市VA系统的核心组件，构建多层次知识库，并利用大语言模型自动化扩展知识库。

Result: 构建了包含101篇论文的知识库，通过专家访谈和定量分析验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: VA-Blueprint为视觉分析系统的开发提供了结构化、可复现和高效的基础。

Abstract: Designing and building visual analytics (VA) systems is a complex, iterative
process that requires the seamless integration of data processing, analytics
capabilities, and visualization techniques. While prior research has
extensively examined the social and collaborative aspects of VA system
authoring, the practical challenges of developing these systems remain
underexplored. As a result, despite the growing number of VA systems, there are
only a few structured knowledge bases to guide their design and development. To
tackle this gap, we propose VA-Blueprint, a methodology and knowledge base that
systematically reviews and categorizes the fundamental building blocks of urban
VA systems, a domain particularly rich and representative due to its intricate
data and unique problem sets. Applying this methodology to an initial set of 20
systems, we identify and organize their core components into a multi-level
structure, forming an initial knowledge base with a structured blueprint for VA
system development. To scale this effort, we leverage a large language model to
automate the extraction of these components for other 81 papers (completing a
corpus of 101 papers), assessing its effectiveness in scaling knowledge base
construction. We evaluate our method through interviews with experts and a
quantitative analysis of annotation metrics. Our contributions provide a deeper
understanding of VA systems' composition and establish a practical foundation
to support more structured, reproducible, and efficient system development.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 选择性预测可以减轻AI不准确预测对决策的负面影响，但会改变错误模式，导致漏诊和漏治增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究选择性预测是否能让人类在AI不提供预测时做出与无AI辅助时相同的决策。

Method: 在临床环境中对259名医生进行用户研究，比较无AI辅助、AI辅助及选择性预测下的决策准确性。

Result: 选择性预测恢复了决策准确性（64% vs. 无AI的66%），但漏诊和漏治分别增加18%和35%。

Conclusion: 需实证验证人类与AI交互的假设，选择性预测虽有效但需注意其副作用。

Abstract: AI has the potential to augment human decision making. However, even
high-performing models can produce inaccurate predictions when deployed. These
inaccuracies, combined with automation bias, where humans overrely on AI
predictions, can result in worse decisions. Selective prediction, in which
potentially unreliable model predictions are hidden from users, has been
proposed as a solution. This approach assumes that when AI abstains and informs
the user so, humans make decisions as they would without AI involvement. To
test this assumption, we study the effects of selective prediction on human
decisions in a clinical context. We conducted a user study of 259 clinicians
tasked with diagnosing and treating hospitalized patients. We compared their
baseline performance without any AI involvement to their AI-assisted accuracy
with and without selective prediction. Our findings indicate that selective
prediction mitigates the negative effects of inaccurate AI in terms of decision
accuracy. Compared to no AI assistance, clinician accuracy declined when shown
inaccurate AI predictions (66% [95% CI: 56%-75%] vs. 56% [95% CI: 46%-66%]),
but recovered under selective prediction (64% [95% CI: 54%-73%]). However,
while selective prediction nearly maintains overall accuracy, our results
suggest that it alters patterns of mistakes: when informed the AI abstains,
clinicians underdiagnose (18% increase in missed diagnoses) and undertreat (35%
increase in missed treatments) compared to no AI input at all. Our findings
underscore the importance of empirically validating assumptions about how
humans engage with AI within human-AI systems.

Motivation: 解决在资源受限设备上实现高效、低延迟的脑机接口控制假肢的挑战。

Method: 结合BrainFlow库和优化深度学习模型，使用进化搜索确定Pareto最优配置，并应用模型压缩技术。

Result: 系统在嵌入式硬件上实现90%的动作分类准确率，支持3自由度控制和语音切换。

Conclusion: CognitiveArm展示了在实时脑控假肢中的潜力，结合语音命令提升了实用性和性能。

Abstract: Efficient control of prosthetic limbs via non-invasive brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs) requires advanced EEG processing, including pre-filtering,
feature extraction, and action prediction, performed in real time on edge AI
hardware. Achieving this on resource-constrained devices presents challenges in
balancing model complexity, computational efficiency, and latency. We present
CognitiveArm, an EEG-driven, brain-controlled prosthetic system implemented on
embedded AI hardware, achieving real-time operation without compromising
accuracy. The system integrates BrainFlow, an open-source library for EEG data
acquisition and streaming, with optimized deep learning (DL) models for precise
brain signal classification. Using evolutionary search, we identify
Pareto-optimal DL configurations through hyperparameter tuning, optimizer
analysis, and window selection, analyzed individually and in ensemble
configurations. We apply model compression techniques such as pruning and
quantization to optimize models for embedded deployment, balancing efficiency
and accuracy. We collected an EEG dataset and designed an annotation pipeline
enabling precise labeling of brain signals corresponding to specific intended
actions, forming the basis for training our optimized DL models. CognitiveArm
also supports voice commands for seamless mode switching, enabling control of
the prosthetic arm's 3 degrees of freedom (DoF). Running entirely on embedded
hardware, it ensures low latency and real-time responsiveness. A full-scale
prototype, interfaced with the OpenBCI UltraCortex Mark IV EEG headset,
achieved up to 90% accuracy in classifying three core actions (left, right,
idle). Voice integration enables multiplexed, variable movement for everyday
tasks (e.g., handshake, cup picking), enhancing real-world performance and
demonstrating CognitiveArm's potential for advanced prosthetic control.

TL;DR: 研究探索了基于ChatGPT的车载对话代理，相比传统预脚本代理，它能实现更自然的交互，提升驾驶稳定性和用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统车载对话代理依赖预脚本或有限语音命令，限制了自然交互，研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 40名驾驶员在驾驶模拟器中测试三种条件（无代理、预脚本代理、ChatGPT代理），评估驾驶性能和主观评价。

Result: ChatGPT代理显著提升驾驶稳定性（纵向/横向加速度、车道偏离变异性更低），主观评价（能力、生动性、信任、偏好）也更高。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的车载对话代理通过自然交互提升驾驶安全和用户体验，潜力显著。

Abstract: Studies on in-vehicle conversational agents have traditionally relied on
pre-scripted prompts or limited voice commands, constraining natural
driver-agent interaction. To resolve this issue, the present study explored the
potential of a ChatGPT-based in-vehicle agent capable of carrying continuous,
multi-turn dialogues. Forty drivers participated in our experiment using a
motion-based driving simulator, comparing three conditions (No agent,
Pre-scripted agent, and ChatGPT-based agent) as a within-subjects variable.
Results showed that the ChatGPT-based agent condition led to more stable
driving performance across multiple metrics. Participants demonstrated lower
variability in longitudinal acceleration, lateral acceleration, and lane
deviation compared to the other two conditions. In subjective evaluations, the
ChatGPT-based agent also received significantly higher ratings in competence,
animacy, affective trust, and preference compared to the Pre-scripted agent.
Our thematic analysis of driver-agent conversations revealed diverse
interaction patterns in topics, including driving assistance/questions,
entertainment requests, and anthropomorphic interactions. Our results highlight
the potential of LLM-powered in-vehicle conversational agents to enhance
driving safety and user experience through natural, context-rich interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨用户在实际使用中是否会仔细阅读AI解释，以及这种阅读行为如何影响其对AI建议的信任和接受程度。

Method: 通过在线研究，分析用户对解释性决策支持系统的信任行为，特别是他们对AI解释的阅读时间和详细程度。

Result: 研究发现，许多用户并未详细阅读AI解释，且这种阅读行为直接影响其是否愿意接受AI建议。

Conclusion: 用户对AI解释的阅读行为是关键因素，未来设计需优化解释内容以提高用户参与度。

Abstract: In the context of AI-based decision support systems, explanations can help
users to judge when to trust the AI's suggestion, and when to question it. In
this way, human oversight can prevent AI errors and biased decision-making.
However, this rests on the assumption that users will consider explanations in
enough detail to be able to catch such errors. We conducted an online study on
trust in explainable DSS, and were surprised to find that in many cases,
participants spent little time on the explanation and did not always consider
it in detail. We present an exploratory analysis of this data, investigating
what factors impact how carefully study participants consider AI explanations,
and how this in turn impacts whether they are open to changing their mind based
on what the AI suggests.

TL;DR: 论文证明了高阶奇异值分解（HOSVD）的经典近似保证是紧的，并构造了一个张量使得HOSVD的近似比达到$N/(1+\varepsilon)$。此外，还证明了ST-HOSVD和HOOI算法的近似保证也是紧的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证HOSVD及其变体算法（如ST-HOSVD和HOOI）的近似保证是否可以达到理论上的最坏情况，从而确认这些算法的性能极限。

Method: 通过构造特定的张量实例，证明HOSVD、ST-HOSVD和HOOI算法的近似比可以达到理论上的最坏情况。

Result: HOSVD、ST-HOSVD和HOOI算法的近似比确实可以达到$N/(1+\varepsilon)$，表明其近似保证是紧的。

Conclusion: HOSVD及其变体算法的近似保证无法进一步改进，因为它们已经达到了理论上的最坏情况性能。

Abstract: We prove that the classic approximation guarantee for the higher-order
singular value decomposition (HOSVD) is tight by constructing a tensor for
which HOSVD achieves an approximation ratio of $N/(1+\varepsilon)$, for any
$\varepsilon > 0$. This matches the upper bound of De Lathauwer et al. (2000a)
and shows that the approximation ratio of HOSVD cannot be improved. Using a
more advanced construction, we also prove that the approximation guarantees for
the ST-HOSVD algorithm of Vannieuwenhoven et al. (2012) and higher-order
orthogonal iteration (HOOI) of De Lathauwer et al. (2000b) are tight by showing
that they can achieve their worst-case approximation ratio of $N / (1 +
\varepsilon)$, for any $\varepsilon > 0$.

Motivation: 在选区划分诉讼中，现有方法（如短爆发算法）在生成少数族裔占多数的选区方面效果有限，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 基于整数规划和列生成算法，结合随机分层分区算法，设计了新的局部优化和紧凑性提升算法。

Result: 新方法在多个数据集上表现优于短爆发算法，能生成更多少数族裔占多数的选区，同时保持选区紧凑性。

Conclusion: 基于整数规划的方法在选区划分中更高效，为投票权法的实施提供了更好的技术支持。

Abstract: In redistricting litigation, effective enforcement of the Voting Rights Act
has often involved providing the court with districting plans that display a
larger number of majority-minority districts than the current proposal (as was
true, for example, in what followed Allen v. Milligan concerning the
congressional districting plan for Alabama in 2023). Recent work by Cannon et
al. proposed a heuristic algorithm for generating plans to optimize
majority-minority districts, which they called short bursts; that algorithm
relies on a sophisticated random walk over the space of all plans,
transitioning in bursts, where the initial plan for each burst is the most
successful plan from the previous burst. We propose a method based on integer
programming, where we build upon another previous work, the stochastic
hierarchical partitioning algorithm, which heuristically generates a robust set
of potential districts (viewed as columns in a standard set partitioning
formulation); that approach was designed to optimize a different notion of
fairness across a statewide plan. We design a new column generation algorithm
to find plans via integer programming that outperforms short bursts on multiple
data sets in generating statewide plans with significantly more
majority-minority districts. These results also rely on a new local
re-optimization algorithm to iteratively improve on any baseline solution, as
well as an algorithm to increase the compactness of districts in plans
generated (without impacting the number of majority-minority districts).

Method: 文章提出了数据预处理的推荐实践，包括异常值处理、非平稳性和时空相关性处理等，并通过案例研究展示不同预处理技术的影响。

Result: 研究表明，不同的预处理技术会导致同一模型产生不同的预测结果，影响预测的可信度。

Conclusion: 通过实施推荐的预处理实践，可以提升AI/ML在气候预测中的稳健性和透明度。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) -- and specifically machine learning (ML) --
applications for climate prediction across timescales are proliferating
quickly. The emergence of these methods prompts a revisit to the impact of data
preprocessing, a topic familiar to the climate community, as more traditional
statistical models work with relatively small sample sizes. Indeed, the skill
and confidence in the forecasts produced by data-driven models are directly
influenced by the quality of the datasets and how they are treated during model
development, thus yielding the colloquialism "garbage in, garbage out." As
such, this article establishes protocols for the proper preprocessing of input
data for AI/ML models designed for climate prediction (i.e., subseasonal to
decadal and longer). The three aims are to: (1) educate researchers,
developers, and end users on the effects that preprocessing has on climate
predictions; (2) provide recommended practices for data preprocessing for such
applications; and (3) empower end users to decipher whether the models they are
using are properly designed for their objectives. Specific topics covered in
this article include the creation of (standardized) anomalies, dealing with
non-stationarity and the spatiotemporally correlated nature of climate data,
and handling of extreme values and variables with potentially complex
distributions. Case studies will illustrate how using different preprocessing
techniques can produce different predictions from the same model, which can
create confusion and decrease confidence in the overall process. Ultimately,
implementing the recommended practices set forth in this article will enhance
the robustness and transparency of AI/ML in climate prediction studies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见但关键的事件（如蛋白质折叠、化学反应等）的动态复杂且高维，需要准确的反应坐标来理解和模拟这些过程。

Method: 引入了一种非参数反应坐标优化框架，结合轨迹历史数据，适用于不规则或不完整数据。

Conclusion: 该方法无需对配置空间进行详尽采样即可准确表征罕见事件动态，为复杂动态系统和纵向数据集分析提供了通用、灵活且稳健的框架。

Abstract: Rare but critical events in complex systems, such as protein folding,
chemical reactions, disease progression, and extreme weather or climate
phenomena, are governed by complex, high-dimensional, stochastic dynamics.
Identifying an optimal reaction coordinate (RC) that accurately captures the
progress of these dynamics is crucial for understanding and simulating such
processes. This work introduces a nonparametric RC optimization framework that
incorporates trajectory histories, enabling robust analysis even for irregular
or incomplete data. The power of the method is demonstrated through
increasingly challenging analyses of protein folding dynamics, where it
provides accurate committor estimates that pass a stringent validation test and
yield high-resolution free energy profiles. Its generality is further
illustrated through applications to dynamics in phase space, a conceptual ocean
circulation model, and a longitudinal clinical dataset. These results
demonstrate that rare event dynamics can be accurately characterized without
exhaustive sampling of the configuration space, establishing a general,
flexible, and robust framework for analyzing complex dynamical systems and
longitudinal datasets.

Abstract: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of death globally,
with computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) serving as a key
diagnostic tool. However, coronary arterial analysis using CTCA, such as
identifying artery-specific features from computational modelling, is
labour-intensive and time-consuming. Automated anatomical labelling of coronary
arteries offers a potential solution, yet the inherent anatomical variability
of coronary trees presents a significant challenge. Traditional knowledge-based
labelling methods fall short in leveraging data-driven insights, while recent
deep-learning approaches often demand substantial computational resources and
overlook critical clinical knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose
a lightweight method that integrates anatomical knowledge with rule-based
topology constraints for effective coronary artery labelling. Our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, providing a
promising alternative for automated coronary artery labelling.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable classification of brain tumors from magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is critical for effective diagnosis and treatment
planning. This study presents an ensemble-based deep learning framework that
combines MobileNetV2 and DenseNet121 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using
a soft voting strategy to classify three common brain tumor types: glioma,
meningioma, and pituitary adenoma. The models were trained and evaluated on the
Figshare dataset using a stratified 5-fold cross-validation protocol. To
enhance transparency and clinical trust, the framework integrates an
Explainable AI (XAI) module employing Grad-CAM++ for class-specific saliency
visualization, alongside a symbolic Clinical Decision Rule Overlay (CDRO) that
maps predictions to established radiological heuristics. The ensemble
classifier achieved superior performance compared to individual CNNs, with an
accuracy of 91.7%, precision of 91.9%, recall of 91.7%, and F1-score of 91.6%.
Grad-CAM++ visualizations revealed strong spatial alignment between model
attention and expert-annotated tumor regions, supported by Dice coefficients up
to 0.88 and IoU scores up to 0.78. Clinical rule activation further validated
model predictions in cases with distinct morphological features. A
human-centered interpretability assessment involving five board-certified
radiologists yielded high Likert-scale scores for both explanation usefulness
(mean = 4.4) and heatmap-region correspondence (mean = 4.0), reinforcing the
framework's clinical relevance. Overall, the proposed approach offers a robust,
interpretable, and generalizable solution for automated brain tumor

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多发性硬化症（MS）的异质性进展需要个性化医疗，而图像生成模型可以为数据驱动的预后提供工具。

Method: 采用体素空间方法，结合多模态患者数据（如MRI和治疗信息），预测未来时间点的病灶演变。

Result: 模型在多中心数据集上准确预测了六种不同治疗的未来病灶，并展示了在临床任务中的潜在应用。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了基于因果的图像生成模型在MS数据驱动预后中的潜力。

Abstract: Image-based personalized medicine has the potential to transform healthcare,
particularly for diseases that exhibit heterogeneous progression such as
Multiple Sclerosis (MS). In this work, we introduce the first treatment-aware
spatio-temporal diffusion model that is able to generate future masks
demonstrating lesion evolution in MS. Our voxel-space approach incorporates
multi-modal patient data, including MRI and treatment information, to forecast
new and enlarging T2 (NET2) lesion masks at a future time point. Extensive
experiments on a multi-centre dataset of 2131 patient 3D MRIs from randomized
clinical trials for relapsing-remitting MS demonstrate that our generative
model is able to accurately predict NET2 lesion masks for patients across six
different treatments. Moreover, we demonstrate our model has the potential for
real-world clinical applications through downstream tasks such as future lesion
count and location estimation, binary lesion activity classification, and
generating counterfactual future NET2 masks for several treatments with
different efficacies. This work highlights the potential of causal, image-based
generative models as powerful tools for advancing data-driven prognostics in
MS.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在医学影像任务中的幻觉问题，分析了图像到文本和文本到图像两种方向的错误，并提出了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在医学影像任务中常产生幻觉（自信但错误的输出），可能误导临床决策，因此需要研究其错误模式以提高可靠性。

Method: 研究分析了图像到文本（生成报告）和文本到图像（生成影像）任务中的幻觉，使用专家标准评估错误。

Result: 发现幻觉在解释和生成任务中均有常见模式，并识别了模型架构和训练数据等失败因素。

Conclusion: 通过系统研究，为提升LLM驱动的医学影像系统的安全性和可信度提供了见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to medical imaging
tasks, including image interpretation and synthetic image generation. However,
these models often produce hallucinations, which are confident but incorrect
outputs that can mislead clinical decisions. This study examines hallucinations
in two directions: image to text, where LLMs generate reports from X-ray, CT,
or MRI scans, and text to image, where models create medical images from
clinical prompts. We analyze errors such as factual inconsistencies and
anatomical inaccuracies, evaluating outputs using expert informed criteria
across imaging modalities. Our findings reveal common patterns of hallucination
in both interpretive and generative tasks, with implications for clinical
reliability. We also discuss factors contributing to these failures, including
model architecture and training data. By systematically studying both image
understanding and generation, this work provides insights into improving the
safety and trustworthiness of LLM driven medical imaging systems.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time novel view synthesis with high
visual fidelity, but its substantial storage requirements hinder practical
deployment, prompting state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3DGS methods to incorporate
compression modules. However, these 3DGS generative compression techniques
introduce unique distortions lacking systematic quality assessment research. To
this end, we establish 3DGS-VBench, a large-scale Video Quality Assessment
(VQA) Dataset and Benchmark with 660 compressed 3DGS models and video sequences
generated from 11 scenes across 6 SOTA 3DGS compression algorithms with
systematically designed parameter levels. With annotations from 50
participants, we obtained MOS scores with outlier removal and validated dataset
reliability. We benchmark 6 3DGS compression algorithms on storage efficiency
and visual quality, and evaluate 15 quality assessment metrics across multiple
paradigms. Our work enables specialized VQA model training for 3DGS, serving as
a catalyst for compression and quality assessment research. The dataset is

Conclusion: SAGCNet通过结合图结构和空间适配器，有效解决了3D MRI缺失切片合成问题，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides detailed soft-tissue
characteristics that assist in disease diagnosis and screening. However, the
accuracy of clinical practice is often hindered by missing or unusable slices
due to various factors. Volumetric MRI synthesis methods have been developed to
address this issue by imputing missing slices from available ones. The inherent
3D nature of volumetric MRI data, such as cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR),
poses significant challenges for missing slice imputation approaches, including
(1) the difficulty of modeling local inter-slice correlations and dependencies
of volumetric slices, and (2) the limited exploration of crucial 3D spatial
information and global context. In this study, to mitigate these issues, we
present Spatial-Aware Graph Completion Network (SAGCNet) to overcome the
dependency on complete volumetric data, featuring two main innovations: (1) a
volumetric slice graph completion module that incorporates the inter-slice
relationships into a graph structure, and (2) a volumetric spatial adapter
component that enables our model to effectively capture and utilize various
forms of 3D spatial context. Extensive experiments on cardiac MRI datasets
demonstrate that SAGCNet is capable of synthesizing absent CMR slices,
outperforming competitive state-of-the-art MRI synthesis methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, our model maintains superior
performance even with limited slice data.

Motivation: 多序列MRI的异质性限制了深度学习模型的泛化能力，影响了其临床实用性。

Method: 收集了34个数据集（336,476个体积MRI扫描），提出了一种新的预训练范式，解耦解剖不变特征和序列特异性变化。

Result: 在44个下游任务中，PRISM在39个任务中表现最佳，显著优于非预训练模型和其他基础模型。

Conclusion: PRISM为多序列MRI分析提供了可扩展框架，增强了AI在放射学中的转化潜力。

Abstract: Multi-sequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers remarkable
versatility, enabling the distinct visualization of different tissue types.
Nevertheless, the inherent heterogeneity among MRI sequences poses significant
challenges to the generalization capability of deep learning models. These
challenges undermine model performance when faced with varying acquisition
parameters, thereby severely restricting their clinical utility. In this study,
we present PRISM, a foundation model PRe-trained with large-scale
multI-Sequence MRI. We collected a total of 64 datasets from both public and
private sources, encompassing a wide range of whole-body anatomical structures,
with scans spanning diverse MRI sequences. Among them, 336,476 volumetric MRI
scans from 34 datasets (8 public and 26 private) were curated to construct the
largest multi-organ multi-sequence MRI pretraining corpus to date. We propose a
novel pretraining paradigm that disentangles anatomically invariant features
from sequence-specific variations in MRI, while preserving high-level semantic
representations. We established a benchmark comprising 44 downstream tasks,
including disease diagnosis, image segmentation, registration, progression
prediction, and report generation. These tasks were evaluated on 32 public
datasets and 5 private cohorts. PRISM consistently outperformed both
non-pretrained models and existing foundation models, achieving first-rank
results in 39 out of 44 downstream benchmarks with statistical significance
improvements. These results underscore its ability to learn robust and
generalizable representations across unseen data acquired under diverse MRI
protocols. PRISM provides a scalable framework for multi-sequence MRI analysis,
thereby enhancing the translational potential of AI in radiology. It delivers
consistent performance across diverse imaging protocols, reinforcing its
clinical applicability.

Motivation: 空间转录组学（ST）的分辨率受限于当前平台，而现有方法在利用H&E染色组织学增强分辨率时面临特征提取、多模态对齐和基因特异性建模三大挑战。

Method: HaDM-ST包括语义蒸馏网络（提取H&E图像的预测线索）、空间对齐模块（实现像素级对应）和通道感知对抗学习器（精细基因级建模）。

Result: 在200个基因的实验中，HaDM-ST在空间保真度和基因级一致性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HaDM-ST通过结合H&E图像和低分辨率ST，显著提升了高分辨率ST预测的性能。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) reveals spatial heterogeneity of gene
expression, yet its resolution is limited by current platforms. Recent methods
enhance resolution via H&E-stained histology, but three major challenges
persist: (1) isolating expression-relevant features from visually complex H&E
images; (2) achieving spatially precise multimodal alignment in diffusion-based
frameworks; and (3) modeling gene-specific variation across expression
channels. We propose HaDM-ST (Histology-assisted Differential Modeling for ST
Generation), a high-resolution ST generation framework conditioned on H&E
images and low-resolution ST. HaDM-ST includes: (i) a semantic distillation
network to extract predictive cues from H&E; (ii) a spatial alignment module
enforcing pixel-wise correspondence with low-resolution ST; and (iii) a
channel-aware adversarial learner for fine-grained gene-level modeling.
Experiments on 200 genes across diverse tissues and species show HaDM-ST
consistently outperforms prior methods, enhancing spatial fidelity and
gene-level coherence in high-resolution ST predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多步扩散方法效率低，DiffVC-OSD旨在通过一步扩散提升压缩效率和感知质量。

Method: 采用一步扩散模型，结合时间上下文适配器和端到端微调策略。

Result: DiffVC-OSD在感知压缩性能上达到最优，解码速度提升20倍，比特率降低86.92%。

Conclusion: DiffVC-OSD在视频压缩领域表现出色，兼具高效性和高质量。

Abstract: In this work, we first propose DiffVC-OSD, a One-Step Diffusion-based
Perceptual Neural Video Compression framework. Unlike conventional multi-step
diffusion-based methods, DiffVC-OSD feeds the reconstructed latent
representation directly into a One-Step Diffusion Model, enhancing perceptual
quality through a single diffusion step guided by both temporal context and the
latent itself. To better leverage temporal dependencies, we design a Temporal
Context Adapter that encodes conditional inputs into multi-level features,
offering more fine-grained guidance for the Denoising Unet. Additionally, we
employ an End-to-End Finetuning strategy to improve overall compression
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffVC-OSD achieves
state-of-the-art perceptual compression performance, offers about 20$\times$
faster decoding and a 86.92\% bitrate reduction compared to the corresponding
multi-step diffusion-based variant.

Conclusion: ALDEN通过解剖学感知设计，显著提升了低剂量CT去噪的质量和实用性。

Abstract: To reduce radiation exposure and improve the diagnostic efficacy of low-dose
computed tomography (LDCT), numerous deep learning-based denoising methods have
been developed to mitigate noise and artifacts. However, most of these
approaches ignore the anatomical semantics of human tissues, which may
potentially result in suboptimal denoising outcomes. To address this problem,
we propose ALDEN, an anatomy-aware LDCT denoising method that integrates
semantic features of pretrained vision models (PVMs) with adversarial and
contrastive learning. Specifically, we introduce an anatomy-aware discriminator
that dynamically fuses hierarchical semantic features from reference
normal-dose CT (NDCT) via cross-attention mechanisms, enabling tissue-specific
realism evaluation in the discriminator. In addition, we propose a
semantic-guided contrastive learning module that enforces anatomical
consistency by contrasting PVM-derived features from LDCT, denoised CT and
NDCT, preserving tissue-specific patterns through positive pairs and
suppressing artifacts via dual negative pairs. Extensive experiments conducted
on two LDCT denoising datasets reveal that ALDEN achieves the state-of-the-art
performance, offering superior anatomy preservation and substantially reducing
over-smoothing issue of previous work. Further validation on a downstream
multi-organ segmentation task (encompassing 117 anatomical structures) affirms
the model's ability to maintain anatomical awareness.

Conclusion: 人机协作方法为AI辅助医疗诊断提供了高效、准确的新方向。

Abstract: Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most prevalent form of breast cancer,
and early, accurate diagnosis is critical to improving patient survival rates
by guiding treatment decisions. Combining medical expertise with artificial
intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for enhancing the precision and
efficiency of IDC detection. In this work, we propose a human-in-the-loop
(HITL) deep learning system designed to detect IDC in histopathology images.
The system begins with an initial diagnosis provided by a high-performance
EfficientNetV2S model, offering feedback from AI to the human expert. Medical
professionals then review the AI-generated results, correct any misclassified
images, and integrate the revised labels into the training dataset, forming a
feedback loop from the human back to the AI. This iterative process refines the
model's performance over time. The EfficientNetV2S model itself achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods in the literature,
with an overall accuracy of 93.65\%. Incorporating the human-in-the-loop system
further improves the model's accuracy using four experimental groups with
misclassified images. These results demonstrate the potential of this
collaborative approach to enhance AI performance in diagnostic systems. This
work contributes to advancing automated, efficient, and highly accurate methods
for IDC detection through human-AI collaboration, offering a promising
direction for future AI-assisted medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in generative modelling, existing diffusion
models often struggle to produce anatomically precise female pelvic images,
limiting their application in gynaecological imaging, where data scarcity and
patient privacy concerns are critical. To overcome these barriers, we introduce
a novel diffusion-based framework for uterine MRI synthesis, integrating both
unconditional and conditioned Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs)
and Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in 2D and 3D. Our approach generates
anatomically coherent, high fidelity synthetic images that closely mimic real
scans and provide valuable resources for training robust diagnostic models. We
evaluate generative quality using advanced perceptual and distributional
metrics, benchmarking against standard reconstruction methods, and demonstrate
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy on a key classification task. A
blinded expert evaluation further validates the clinical realism of our
synthetic images. We release our models with privacy safeguards and a
comprehensive synthetic uterine MRI dataset to support reproducible research
and advance equitable AI in gynaecology.

Abstract: We propose a deep learning-based approach that integrates MRI sequence

synthesis from clinical weighted MRI. Our physics-driven neural network embeds
MRI sequence parameters -- repetition time (TR), echo time (TE), and inversion
time (TI) -- directly into the model via parameter embedding, enabling the
network to learn the underlying physical principles of MRI signal formation.
The model takes conventional T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and T2-FLAIR images as
input and synthesizes T1, T2, and proton density (PD) quantitative maps.
Trained on healthy brain MR images, it was evaluated on both internal and
external test datasets. The proposed method achieved high performance with PSNR
values exceeding 34 dB and SSIM values above 0.92 for all synthesized parameter
maps. It outperformed conventional deep learning models in accuracy and
robustness, including data with previously unseen brain structures and lesions.
Notably, our model accurately synthesized quantitative maps for these unseen
pathological regions, highlighting its superior generalization capability.
Incorporating MRI sequence parameters via parameter embedding allows the neural
network to better learn the physical characteristics of MR signals,
significantly enhancing the performance and reliability of quantitative MRI
synthesis. This method shows great potential for accelerating qMRI and

Conclusion: PCA引导的自编码框架有效提升了红外热成像数据的结构化降维和缺陷表征能力。

Abstract: Active Infrared thermography (AIRT) is a widely adopted non-destructive
testing (NDT) technique for detecting subsurface anomalies in industrial
components. Due to the high dimensionality of AIRT data, current approaches
employ non-linear autoencoders (AEs) for dimensionality reduction. However, the
latent space learned by AIRT AEs lacks structure, limiting their effectiveness
in downstream defect characterization tasks. To address this limitation, this
paper proposes a principal component analysis guided (PCA-guided) autoencoding
framework for structured dimensionality reduction to capture intricate,
non-linear features in thermographic signals while enforcing a structured
latent space. A novel loss function, PCA distillation loss, is introduced to
guide AIRT AEs to align the latent representation with structured PCA
components while capturing the intricate, non-linear patterns in thermographic
signals. To evaluate the utility of the learned, structured latent space, we
propose a neural network-based evaluation metric that assesses its suitability
for defect characterization. Experimental results show that the proposed
PCA-guided AE outperforms state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction methods on
PVC, CFRP, and PLA samples in terms of contrast, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),
and neural network-based metrics.

Abstract: The core role of medical images in disease diagnosis makes their quality
directly affect the accuracy of clinical judgment. However, due to factors such
as low-dose scanning, equipment limitations and imaging artifacts, medical
images are often accompanied by non-uniform noise interference, which seriously
affects structure recognition and lesion detection. This paper proposes a
medical image adaptive denoising model (MI-ND) that integrates multi-scale
convolutional and Transformer architecture, introduces a noise level estimator
(NLE) and a noise adaptive attention module (NAAB), and realizes
channel-spatial attention regulation and cross-modal feature fusion driven by
noise perception. Systematic testing is carried out on multimodal public
datasets. Experiments show that this method significantly outperforms the
comparative methods in image quality indicators such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS,
and improves the F1 score and ROC-AUC in downstream diagnostic tasks, showing
strong prac-tical value and promotional potential. The model has outstanding
benefits in structural recovery, diagnostic sensitivity, and cross-modal
robustness, and provides an effective solution for medical image enhancement
and AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment.

Conclusion: Sea-Undistort数据集和增强的扩散模型为浅水测深图像恢复提供了有效工具，显著提升了测深精度和图像质量。

Abstract: Accurate image-based bathymetric mapping in shallow waters remains
challenging due to the complex optical distortions such as wave induced
patterns, scattering and sunglint, introduced by the dynamic water surface, the
water column properties, and solar illumination. In this work, we introduce
Sea-Undistort, a comprehensive synthetic dataset of 1200 paired 512x512
through-water scenes rendered in Blender. Each pair comprises a distortion-free
and a distorted view, featuring realistic water effects such as sun glint,
waves, and scattering over diverse seabeds. Accompanied by per-image metadata
such as camera parameters, sun position, and average depth, Sea-Undistort
enables supervised training that is otherwise infeasible in real environments.
We use Sea-Undistort to benchmark two state-of-the-art image restoration
methods alongside an enhanced lightweight diffusion-based framework with an
early-fusion sun-glint mask. When applied to real aerial data, the enhanced
diffusion model delivers more complete Digital Surface Models (DSMs) of the
seabed, especially in deeper areas, reduces bathymetric errors, suppresses
glint and scattering, and crisply restores fine seabed details. Dataset,
weights, and code are publicly available at

*Bowen Tong,Hao Chen,Shaorui Guo,Dong Liu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理信息的混合框架SSD-Reg，将扩散模型作为学习正则化嵌入变分方案，解决了微波断层扫描中的非线性不适定问题，无需配对数据即可恢复复杂结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法难以恢复精细结构，深度学习需要大量配对数据且泛化性差，因此提出结合物理模型与学习正则化的新方法。

Method: SSD-Reg将扩散先验嵌入迭代重建过程，作为Plug-and-Play模块，保持物理一致性和结构分布学习。

Result: 实验表明SSD-Reg在准确性、稳定性和鲁棒性上表现优异，能有效解决功能图像重建的不适定性。

Conclusion: SSD-Reg为微波断层扫描提供了一种灵活且高效的解决方案，结合了物理模型与深度学习的优势。

Abstract: Microwave Tomography (MWT) aims to reconstruct the dielectric properties of
tissues from measured scattered electromagnetic fields. This inverse problem is
highly nonlinear and ill-posed, posing significant challenges for conventional
optimization-based methods, which, despite being grounded in physical models,
often fail to recover fine structural details. Recent deep learning strategies,
including end-to-end and post-processing networks, have improved reconstruction
quality but typically require large paired training datasets and may struggle
to generalize. To overcome these limitations, we propose a physics-informed
hybrid framework that integrates diffusion models as learned regularization
within a data-consistency-driven variational scheme. Specifically, we introduce
Single-Step Diffusion Regularization (SSD-Reg), a novel approach that embeds
diffusion priors into the iterative reconstruction process, enabling the
recovery of complex anatomical structures without the need for paired data.
SSD-Reg maintains fidelity to both the governing physics and learned structural
distributions, improving accuracy, stability, and robustness. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SSD-Reg, implemented as a Plug-and-Play (PnP)
module, provides a flexible and effective solution for tackling the
ill-posedness inherent in functional image reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SPDEs在建模复杂物理系统中起关键作用，但数值解常因模型误差和环境变化导致精度降低。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 将物理规律编码到扩散模型的分数函数中，利用仿真数据并通过基于似然的修正结合观测信息，提出无需训练的集成分数滤波器以提高计算效率。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法在稀疏和噪声观测下具有高精度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架能自适应学习SPDEs的时变解，适用于高维实时推断，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for adaptively learning the time-evolving
solutions of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) using
score-based diffusion models within a recursive Bayesian inference setting.
SPDEs play a central role in modeling complex physical systems under
uncertainty, but their numerical solutions often suffer from model errors and
reduced accuracy due to incomplete physical knowledge and environmental
variability. To address these challenges, we encode the governing physics into
the score function of a diffusion model using simulation data and incorporate
observational information via a likelihood-based correction in a reverse-time
stochastic differential equation. This enables adaptive learning through
iterative refinement of the solution as new data becomes available. To improve
computational efficiency in high-dimensional settings, we introduce the
ensemble score filter, a training-free approximation of the score function
designed for real-time inference. Numerical experiments on benchmark SPDEs
demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method under sparse and
noisy observations.

*John D. Mayfield*

Main category: q-bio.OT

TL;DR: 提出了一种理论数学框架，利用傅里叶和拉普拉斯变换将时间序列数据转换为频域或s域，结合哈密顿公式和量子-经典混合计算，以增强神经退行性疾病的模式检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的时间域分析方法难以捕捉神经退行性疾病的复杂非线性轨迹和隐藏的振荡模式，限制了预测准确性。

Method: 通过傅里叶和拉普拉斯变换将数据转换到频域或s域，使用哈密顿公式建模神经元动态，并利用量子-经典混合计算（如VQE）进行模式检测。

Result: 该框架为未来量子增强的神经退行性疾病分析提供了理论基础，并在阿尔茨海默病分类中展示了高达99.89%的准确性。

Conclusion: 这一框架为重新定义神经退行性疾病的精准医学奠定了基础，未来需进一步验证。

Abstract: Progressive neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD),
multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS), exhibit complex, nonlinear trajectories that challenge
deterministic modeling. Traditional time-domain analyses of multiomic and
neuroimaging data often fail to capture hidden oscillatory patterns, limiting
predictive accuracy. We propose a theoretical mathematical framework that
transforms time-series data into frequency or s-domain using Fourier and
Laplace transforms, models neuronal dynamics via Hamiltonian formulations, and
employs quantum-classical hybrid computing with variational quantum
eigensolvers (VQE) for enhanced pattern detection. This theoretical construct
serves as a foundation for future empirical works in quantum-enhanced analysis
of neurodegenerative diseases. We extend this to quaternionic representations
with three imaginary axes ($i, j, k$) to model multistate Hamiltonians in
multifaceted disorders, drawing from quantum neuromorphic computing to capture
entangled neural dynamics \citep{Pehle2020, Emani2019}. This approach leverages
quantum advantages in handling high-dimensional amplitude-phase data, enabling
outlier detection and frequency signature analysis. Potential clinical
applications include identifying high-risk patients with rapid progression or
therapy resistance using s-domain biomarkers, supported by quantum machine
learning (QML) precedents achieving up to 99.89% accuracy in Alzheimer's
classification \citep{Belay2024, Bhowmik2025}. This framework aims to lay the
groundwork for redefining precision medicine for neurodegenerative diseases
through future validations.

TL;DR: PiKV是一个针对MoE架构的并行分布式KV缓存框架，通过分片存储、路由优化和自适应调度减少KV缓存的开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模和上下文长度的增加，KV缓存的存储和通信成本成为多GPU和多节点推理的主要瓶颈。

Method: PiKV采用专家分片KV存储、路由优化、自适应调度和压缩模块来降低内存和通信开销。

Result: PiKV已开源，并与Nvidia kvpress集成以加速性能。

Conclusion: PiKV旨在成为MoE架构的全面KV缓存管理系统。

Abstract: As large language models continue to scale up in both size and context
length, the memory and communication cost of key-value (KV) cache storage has
become a major bottleneck in multi-GPU and multi-node inference. While
MoE-based architectures sparsify computation across experts, the corresponding
KV caches remain dense and globally synchronized, resulting in significant
overhead.
  We introduce \textbf{PiKV}, a parallel and distributed KV cache serving
framework tailored for MoE architecture. PiKV leverages \textit{expert-sharded
KV storage} to partition caches across GPUs, \textit{PiKV routing} to reduce
token-to-KV access, and a \textit{PiKV Scheduling} to adaptively retain
query-relevant entries. To further reduce memory usage, PiKV integrates
\textit{PiKV Compression} modules the caching pipeline for acceleration.
  PiKV is recently publicly available as an open-source software library:
\href{https://github.com/NoakLiu/PiKV}{https://github.com/NoakLiu/PiKV}.
Experiments details is recorded at:
\href{https://github.com/NoakLiu/PiKV/blob/main/downstream_tasks/README.md}{https://github.com/NoakLiu/PiKV/Experimental\_Results}.
We also have PiKV integrated with Nvidia kvpress for acceleration, details see

Motivation: 通过物联网（IoT）实时监测城市和微电网的电力消耗有助于预测需求和优化电网运行，但传统方法存在隐私泄露和计算成本高的问题。

Method: 采用联邦学习（FL）框架，在边缘设备上训练本地模型并聚合到云端，优化训练过程以减少计算成本，并使用指数加权损失提升预测准确性。

Result: 在OpenEIA数据集上验证了方法的有效性，结果显示其优于ARIMA和单用户DNN等基线方法，且具有可扩展性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在保护隐私的同时，显著提高了电力需求预测的准确性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Real-time monitoring of power consumption in cities and micro-grids through
the Internet of Things (IoT) can help forecast future demand and optimize grid
operations. But moving all consumer-level usage data to the cloud for
predictions and analysis at fine time scales can expose activity patterns.
Federated Learning~(FL) is a privacy-sensitive collaborative DNN training
approach that retains data on edge devices, trains the models on private data
locally, and aggregates the local models in the cloud. But key challenges
exist: (i) clients can have non-independently identically distributed~(non-IID)
data, and (ii) the learning should be computationally cheap while scaling to
1000s of (unseen) clients. In this paper, we develop and evaluate several
optimizations to FL training across edge and cloud for time-series demand
forecasting in micro-grids and city-scale utilities using DNNs to achieve a
high prediction accuracy while minimizing the training cost. We showcase the
benefit of using exponentially weighted loss while training and show that it
further improves the prediction of the final model. Finally, we evaluate these
strategies by validating over 1000s of clients for three states in the US from
the OpenEIA corpus, and performing FL both in a pseudo-distributed setting and
a Pi edge cluster. The results highlight the benefits of the proposed methods
over baselines like ARIMA and DNNs trained for individual consumers, which are
not scalable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图的谣言检测模型假设谣言传播树具有深结构，但实际数据统计显示其多为宽结构，大多数节点为浅层回复。

Method: 提出RAGCL方法，基于节点中心性进行自适应视图增强（节点、属性、边的概率丢弃），并设计三条增强原则。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，RAGCL优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 揭示了RPTs的宽结构特性，并提出了一种有效的自适应图对比学习方法，其原则和技术可推广至其他树结构图应用。

Abstract: Rumor detection on social media has become increasingly important. Most
existing graph-based models presume rumor propagation trees (RPTs) have deep
structures and learn sequential stance features along branches. However,
through statistical analysis on real-world datasets, we find RPTs exhibit wide
structures, with most nodes being shallow 1-level replies. To focus learning on
intensive substructures, we propose Rumor Adaptive Graph Contrastive Learning
(RAGCL) method with adaptive view augmentation guided by node centralities. We
summarize three principles for RPT augmentation: 1) exempt root nodes, 2)
retain deep reply nodes, 3) preserve lower-level nodes in deep sections. We
employ node dropping, attribute masking and edge dropping with probabilities
from centrality-based importance scores to generate views. A graph contrastive
objective then learns robust rumor representations. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets demonstrate RAGCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
Our work reveals the wide-structure nature of RPTs and contributes an effective
graph contrastive learning approach tailored for rumor detection through
principled adaptive augmentation. The proposed principles and augmentation
techniques can potentially benefit other applications involving tree-structured
graphs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于图监督对比学习的异常检测框架（AD-GSCL），用于解决谣言检测中的数据稀缺和类别不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实社交媒体数据中谣言占少数且分布不均衡，现有方法假设数据平衡且标注有限，无法有效应对。

Method: 构建了微博和推特的大规模对话数据集，提出AD-GSCL框架，将未标注数据视为非谣言，利用图对比学习进行检测。

Result: 实验表明AD-GSCL在类别平衡、不平衡和少样本条件下均表现优越。

Conclusion: 该框架为现实世界中数据不平衡的谣言检测提供了有价值的解决方案。

Abstract: Current rumor detection methods based on propagation structure learning
predominately treat rumor detection as a class-balanced classification task on
limited labeled data. However, real-world social media data exhibits an
imbalanced distribution with a minority of rumors among massive regular posts.
To address the data scarcity and imbalance issues, we construct two large-scale
conversation datasets from Weibo and Twitter and analyze the domain
distributions. We find obvious differences between rumor and non-rumor
distributions, with non-rumors mostly in entertainment domains while rumors
concentrate in news, indicating the conformity of rumor detection to an anomaly
detection paradigm. Correspondingly, we propose the Anomaly Detection framework
with Graph Supervised Contrastive Learning (AD-GSCL). It heuristically treats
unlabeled data as non-rumors and adapts graph contrastive learning for rumor
detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate AD-GSCL's superiority under
class-balanced, imbalanced, and few-shot conditions. Our findings provide
valuable insights for real-world rumor detection featuring imbalanced data
distributions.

Conclusion: 生态学模型和方法可为AI模型研究提供新视角，揭示了开源生态的动态演变。

Abstract: Many have observed that the development and deployment of generative machine
learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models follow a distinctive
pattern in which pre-trained models are adapted and fine-tuned for specific
downstream tasks. However, there is limited empirical work that examines the
structure of these interactions. This paper analyzes 1.86 million models on
Hugging Face, a leading peer production platform for model development. Our
study of model family trees -- networks that connect fine-tuned models to their
base or parent -- reveals sprawling fine-tuning lineages that vary widely in
size and structure. Using an evolutionary biology lens to study ML models, we
use model metadata and model cards to measure the genetic similarity and
mutation of traits over model families. We find that models tend to exhibit a
family resemblance, meaning their genetic markers and traits exhibit more
overlap when they belong to the same model family. However, these similarities
depart in certain ways from standard models of asexual reproduction, because
mutations are fast and directed, such that two `sibling' models tend to exhibit
more similarity than parent/child pairs. Further analysis of the directional
drifts of these mutations reveals qualitative insights about the open machine
learning ecosystem: Licenses counter-intuitively drift from restrictive,
commercial licenses towards permissive or copyleft licenses, often in violation
of upstream license's terms; models evolve from multi-lingual compatibility
towards english-only compatibility; and model cards reduce in length and
standardize by turning, more often, to templates and automatically generated
text. Overall, this work takes a step toward an empirically grounded
understanding of model fine-tuning and suggests that ecological models and
methods can yield novel scientific insights.

Motivation: 解决非视距（NLoS）条件下设备定位的挑战，利用EMS增强信道差异性和空间指纹。

Method: 开发基于码本的优化框架，设计EMS相位剖面，以提升关键嵌入指标、定位误差、可信度和连续性。

Result: 通过3D射线追踪模拟，优化后的EMS配置将90%分位定位误差从60米降至25米，显著提升可信度和连续性。

Conclusion: 首次利用静态EMS增强信道图表（CC），在NLoS条件下显著提升定位性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces the use of static electromagnetic skins (EMSs) to
enable robust device localization via channel charting (CC) in realistic urban
environments. We develop a rigorous optimization framework that leverages EMS
to enhance channel dissimilarity and spatial fingerprinting, formulating EMS
phase profile design as a codebook-based problem targeting the upper quantiles
of key embedding metric, localization error, trustworthiness, and continuity.
Through 3D ray-traced simulations of a representative city scenario, we
demonstrate that optimized EMS configurations, in addition to significant
improvement of the average positioning error, reduce the 90th-percentile
localization error from over 60 m (no EMS) to less than 25 m, while drastically
improving trustworthiness and continuity. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to exploit Smart Radio Environment (SRE) with static EMS for
enhancing CC, achieving substantial gains in localization performance under
challenging None-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) conditions.

Conclusion: 该框架为适应CSI可用性并通过联合学习协调感知与传输的安全机会通信提供了实用路径。

Abstract: We propose a joint learning framework for Byzantine-resilient spectrum
sensing and secure intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)--assisted opportunistic
access under channel state information (CSI) uncertainty. The sensing stage
performs logit-domain Bayesian updates with trimmed aggregation and
attention-weighted consensus, and the base station (BS) fuses network beliefs
with a conservative minimum rule, preserving detection accuracy under a bounded
number of Byzantine users. Conditioned on the sensing outcome, we pose downlink
design as sum mean-squared error (MSE) minimization under transmit-power and
signal-leakage constraints and jointly optimize the BS precoder, IRS phase
shifts, and user equalizers. With partial (or known) CSI, we develop an
augmented-Lagrangian alternating algorithm with projected updates and provide
provable sublinear convergence, with accelerated rates under mild local
curvature. With unknown CSI, we perform constrained Bayesian optimization (BO)
in a geometry-aware low-dimensional latent space using Gaussian process (GP)
surrogates; we prove regret bounds for a constrained upper confidence bound
(UCB) variant of the BO module, and demonstrate strong empirical performance of
the implemented procedure. Simulations across diverse network conditions show
higher detection probability at fixed false-alarm rate under adversarial
attacks, large reductions in sum MSE for honest users, strong suppression of
eavesdropper signal power, and fast convergence. The framework offers a
practical path to secure opportunistic communication that adapts to CSI
availability while coherently coordinating sensing and transmission through
joint learning.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了推理密集型排序问题，并在实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based listwise ranking has shown superior
performance in many passage ranking tasks. With the development of Large
Reasoning Models, many studies have demonstrated that step-by-step reasoning
during test-time helps improve listwise ranking performance. However, due to
the scarcity of reasoning-intensive training data, existing rerankers perform
poorly in many complex ranking scenarios and the ranking ability of
reasoning-intensive rerankers remains largely underdeveloped. In this paper, we
first propose an automated reasoning-intensive training data synthesis
framework, which sources training queries and passages from diverse domains and
applies DeepSeek-R1 to generate high-quality training labels. A
self-consistency data filtering mechanism is designed to ensure the data
quality. To empower the listwise reranker with strong reasoning ability, we
further propose a two-stage post-training approach, which includes a cold-start
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage for reasoning pattern learning and a
reinforcement learning (RL) stage for further ranking ability enhancement.
During the RL stage, based on the nature of listwise ranking, we design a
multi-view ranking reward, which is more effective than a ranking metric-based
reward. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our trained reasoning-intensive
reranker \textbf{ReasonRank} outperforms existing baselines significantly and
also achieves much lower latency than pointwise reranker Rank1. \textbf{Through
further experiments, our ReasonRank has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA)

Motivation: 现有方法依赖大型语言模型（LLMs）隐式整合检索内容，易受检索质量影响且可能偏离用户偏好。

Result: 在三个个性化文本生成数据集上，PrLM表现优于现有方法，且对不同检索器和检索数量具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PrLM通过显式推理用户档案解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了个性化生成的效果和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Personalized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) aims to produce
user-tailored responses by incorporating retrieved user profiles alongside the
input query. Existing methods primarily focus on improving retrieval and rely
on large language models (LLMs) to implicitly integrate the retrieved context
with the query. However, such models are often sensitive to retrieval quality
and may generate responses that are misaligned with user preferences. To
address this limitation, we propose PrLM, a reinforcement learning framework
that trains LLMs to explicitly reason over retrieved user profiles. Guided by a
contrastively trained personalization reward model, PrLM effectively learns
from user responses without requiring annotated reasoning paths. Experiments on
three personalized text generation datasets show that PrLM outperforms existing
methods and remains robust across varying numbers of retrieved profiles and
different retrievers.

TL;DR: BiXSE是一种基于二元交叉熵（BCE）的点式训练方法，利用LLM生成的细粒度相关性标签优化密集检索模型，性能优于对比学习方法，且标注和计算成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的相关性通常是连续的，而传统方法仅依赖二元标签。LLM的进步使得生成细粒度标签成为可能，BiXSE旨在利用这些标签提升模型性能。

Method: BiXSE通过将LLM生成的细粒度相关性分数解释为概率目标，使用二元交叉熵进行点式训练，并利用批次内负样本减少标注和计算成本。

Result: 在多个基准测试（MMTEB、BEIR、TREC-DL）中，BiXSE表现优于基于softmax的对比学习（InfoNCE），并与强排序基线相当或更优。

Conclusion: BiXSE为密集检索模型提供了一种高效、可扩展的训练方法，尤其适用于细粒度相关性标注日益普及的场景。

Abstract: Neural sentence embedding models for dense retrieval typically rely on binary
relevance labels, treating query-document pairs as either relevant or
irrelevant. However, real-world relevance often exists on a continuum, and
recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made it feasible to scale
the generation of fine-grained graded relevance labels. In this work, we
propose BiXSE, a simple and effective pointwise training method that optimizes
binary cross-entropy (BCE) over LLM-generated graded relevance scores. BiXSE
interprets these scores as probabilistic targets, enabling granular supervision
from a single labeled query-document pair per query. Unlike pairwise or
listwise losses that require multiple annotated comparisons per query, BiXSE
achieves strong performance with reduced annotation and compute costs by
leveraging in-batch negatives. Extensive experiments across sentence embedding
(MMTEB) and retrieval benchmarks (BEIR, TREC-DL) show that BiXSE consistently
outperforms softmax-based contrastive learning (InfoNCE), and matches or
exceeds strong pairwise ranking baselines when trained on LLM-supervised data.
BiXSE offers a robust, scalable alternative for training dense retrieval models
as graded relevance supervision becomes increasingly accessible.

Abstract: Dense Retrieval (DR) models have proven to be effective for Document
Retrieval and Information Grounding tasks. Usually, these models are trained
and optimized for improving the relevance of top-ranked documents for a given
query. Previous work has shown that popular DR models are sensitive to the
query and document lexicon: small variations of it may lead to a significant
difference in the set of retrieved documents. In this paper, we propose a
variation of the Multi-Negative Ranking loss for training DR that improves the
coherence of models in retrieving the same documents with respect to
semantically similar queries. The loss penalizes discrepancies between the
top-k ranked documents retrieved for diverse but semantic equivalent queries.
We conducted extensive experiments on various datasets, MS-MARCO, Natural
Questions, BEIR, and TREC DL 19/20. The results show that (i) models optimizes
by our loss are subject to lower sensitivity, and, (ii) interestingly, higher
accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层代理深度搜索框架HierSearch，通过分层强化学习训练，解决了现有深度搜索方法在单一知识源上的局限性，提升了数据效率和工具掌握能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业需要能够同时利用本地和网络知识源的私有深度搜索系统，但现有方法局限于单一知识源，且传统强化学习效率低、工具掌握能力差。

Method: 提出HierSearch框架，包括低层本地和网络深度搜索代理，以及高层规划代理，并设计知识精炼器过滤错误信息。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，HierSearch优于传统强化学习和多源检索增强生成基线，涵盖通用、金融和医疗领域。

Conclusion: HierSearch通过分层设计和知识精炼，显著提升了深度搜索的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Recently, large reasoning models have demonstrated strong mathematical and
coding abilities, and deep search leverages their reasoning capabilities in
challenging information retrieval tasks. Existing deep search works are
generally limited to a single knowledge source, either local or the Web.
However, enterprises often require private deep search systems that can
leverage search tools over both local and the Web corpus. Simply training an
agent equipped with multiple search tools using flat reinforcement learning
(RL) is a straightforward idea, but it has problems such as low training data
efficiency and poor mastery of complex tools. To address the above issue, we
propose a hierarchical agentic deep search framework, HierSearch, trained with
hierarchical RL. At the low level, a local deep search agent and a Web deep
search agent are trained to retrieve evidence from their corresponding domains.
At the high level, a planner agent coordinates low-level agents and provides
the final answer. Moreover, to prevent direct answer copying and error
propagation, we design a knowledge refiner that filters out hallucinations and
irrelevant evidence returned by low-level agents. Experiments show that
HierSearch achieves better performance compared to flat RL, and outperforms
various deep search and multi-source retrieval-augmented generation baselines
in six benchmarks across general, finance, and medical domains.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: CLAP是一种基于LLM的轻量级段落扩展框架，通过分段、解决共指链并生成与密集检索器对齐的伪查询，提升了检索性能，尤其在跨域场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM扩展方法在密集检索器中表现不佳，且段落中仅部分内容与查询相关，其余引入噪声。

Method: CLAP将段落分段为连贯块，解决共指链，生成对齐密集检索器的伪查询，并融合全局和局部信号。

Result: CLAP显著提升检索性能，尤其在跨域场景中，nDCG@10提升高达20.68%。

Conclusion: CLAP通过逻辑为中心的流程实现了领域无关的泛化，优于传统依赖领域知识的扩展方法。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based passage expansion has shown promise for
enhancing first-stage retrieval, but often underperforms with dense retrievers
due to semantic drift and misalignment with their pretrained semantic space.
Beyond this, only a portion of a passage is typically relevant to a query,
while the rest introduces noise--an issue compounded by chunking techniques
that break coreference continuity. We propose Coreference-Linked Augmentation
for Passage Retrieval (CLAP), a lightweight LLM-based expansion framework that
segments passages into coherent chunks, resolves coreference chains, and
generates localized pseudo-queries aligned with dense retriever
representations. A simple fusion of global topical signals and fine-grained
subtopic signals achieves robust performance across domains. CLAP yields
consistent gains even as retriever strength increases, enabling dense
retrievers to match or surpass second-stage rankers such as BM25 + MonoT5-3B,
with up to 20.68% absolute nDCG@10 improvement. These improvements are
especially notable in out-of-domain settings, where conventional LLM-based
expansion methods relying on domain knowledge often falter. CLAP instead adopts
a logic-centric pipeline that enables robust, domain-agnostic generalization.

TL;DR: 提出KSER框架，通过知识过滤和嵌入对齐模块，从LLMs中提取高质量知识以优化推荐系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用LLMs的泛化和推理能力提升推荐系统，但直接使用其生成的知识可能导致性能下降，需解决幻觉、冗余和同质化问题。

Method: KSER框架包含知识过滤模块（ESFNet）和嵌入对齐模块，采用两种训练策略（全参数训练和仅提取器训练）。

Result: 实验验证了知识过滤和对齐模块的必要性，以及仅提取器训练策略的高效性。

Conclusion: KSER框架有效解决了LLMs知识在推荐系统中的问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in leveraging the impressive
generalization capabilities and reasoning ability of large language models
(LLMs) to improve the performance of recommenders. With this operation,
recommenders can access and learn the additional world knowledge and reasoning
information via LLMs. However, in general, for different users and items, the
world knowledge derived from LLMs suffers from issues of hallucination, content
redundant, and information homogenization. Directly feeding the generated
response embeddings into the recommendation model can lead to unavoidable
performance deterioration. To address these challenges, we propose a Knowledge
Selection \& Exploitation Recommendation (KSER) framework, which effectively
select and extracts the high-quality knowledge from LLMs. The framework
consists of two key components: a knowledge filtering module and a embedding
spaces alignment module. In the knowledge filtering module, a Embedding
Selection Filter Network (ESFNet) is designed to assign adaptive weights to
different knowledge chunks in different knowledge fields. In the space
alignment module, an attention-based architecture is proposed to align the
semantic embeddings from LLMs with the feature space used to train the
recommendation models. In addition, two training
strategies--\textbf{all-parameters training} and \textbf{extractor-only
training}--are proposed to flexibly adapt to different downstream tasks and
application scenarios, where the extractor-only training strategy offers a
novel perspective on knowledge-augmented recommendation. Experimental results
validate the necessity and effectiveness of both the knowledge filtering and
alignment modules, and further demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of
the extractor-only training strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷启动物品因缺乏交互历史而难以个性化分发，现有方法（协同过滤或纯内容方法）效果不佳。

Method: SocRipple分两阶段：1. 利用创作者社交关系进行初始曝光；2. 基于早期交互信号和用户嵌入，通过KNN搜索扩展分发。

Result: 在大型视频平台实验中，SocRipple将冷启动物品分发提升36%，同时保持用户参与率。

Conclusion: SocRipple有效平衡了新物品曝光与个性化推荐，解决了冷启动问题。

Abstract: Most industry scale recommender systems face critical cold start challenges
new items lack interaction history, making it difficult to distribute them in a
personalized manner. Standard collaborative filtering models underperform due
to sparse engagement signals, while content only approaches lack user specific
relevance. We propose SocRipple, a novel two stage retrieval framework tailored
for coldstart item distribution in social graph based platforms. Stage 1
leverages the creators social connections for targeted initial exposure. Stage
2 builds on early engagement signals and stable user embeddings learned from
historical interactions to "ripple" outwards via K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
search. Large scale experiments on a major video platform show that SocRipple
boosts cold start item distribution by +36% while maintaining user engagement
rate on cold start items, effectively balancing new item exposure with
personalized recommendations.

Motivation: 冷用户和物品的过滤阈值通常随意设定且差异大，导致评估结果不一致。

Result: 不一致的阈值选择可能导致数据误删或冷实例被误分类为热实例。

Conclusion: 冷启动阈值的设定需更系统化以提高推荐系统的可靠性。

Abstract: In modern recommender systems, experimental settings typically include
filtering out cold users and items based on a minimum interaction threshold.
However, these thresholds are often chosen arbitrarily and vary widely across
studies, leading to inconsistencies that can significantly affect the
comparability and reliability of evaluation results. In this paper, we
systematically explore the cold-start boundary by examining the criteria used
to determine whether a user or an item should be considered cold. Our
experiments incrementally vary the number of interactions for different items
during training, and gradually update the length of user interaction histories
during inference. We investigate the thresholds across several widely used
datasets, commonly represented in recent papers from top-tier conferences, and
on multiple established recommender baselines. Our findings show that
inconsistent selection of cold-start thresholds can either result in the
unnecessary removal of valuable data or lead to the misclassification of cold
instances as warm, introducing more noise into the system.

Motivation: 现有检索器在处理涉及抽象推理、类比思维或多步推理的查询时表现不佳，DIVER旨在解决这一问题。

Method: DIVER包含文档处理、LLM驱动的查询扩展、推理增强检索器和结合LLM评分的重排序器。

Result: 在BRIGHT基准测试中，DIVER的nDCG@10得分达到41.6和28.9，优于其他推理感知模型。

Conclusion: DIVER展示了推理感知检索策略在复杂任务中的有效性，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation has achieved strong performance on
knowledge-intensive tasks where query-document relevance can be identified
through direct lexical or semantic matches. However, many real-world queries
involve abstract reasoning, analogical thinking, or multi-step inference, which
existing retrievers often struggle to capture. To address this challenge, we
present \textbf{DIVER}, a retrieval pipeline tailored for reasoning-intensive
information retrieval. DIVER consists of four components: document processing
to improve input quality, LLM-driven query expansion via iterative document
interaction, a reasoning-enhanced retriever fine-tuned on synthetic
multi-domain data with hard negatives, and a pointwise reranker that combines
LLM-assigned helpfulness scores with retrieval scores. On the BRIGHT benchmark,
DIVER achieves state-of-the-art nDCG@10 scores of 41.6 and 28.9 on original
queries, consistently outperforming competitive reasoning-aware models. These
results demonstrate the effectiveness of reasoning-aware retrieval strategies
in complex real-world tasks. Our code and retrieval model will be released
soon.

Motivation: 冷启动场景中，新物品因交互历史有限而难以有效推荐，现有方法对多模态数据的简单整合方式无法捕捉模态间的复杂关系。

Method: MAMEX采用模态特定的专家网络和可学习的门控机制，动态加权各模态的贡献，以突出最相关的模态信息。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，MAMEX在冷启动场景中优于现有方法，具有更高的准确性和适应性。

Conclusion: MAMEX通过动态整合多模态数据，有效解决了冷启动推荐问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recommendation systems have faced significant challenges in cold-start
scenarios, where new items with a limited history of interaction need to be
effectively recommended to users. Though multimodal data (e.g., images, text,
audio, etc.) offer rich information to address this issue, existing approaches
often employ simplistic integration methods such as concatenation, average
pooling, or fixed weighting schemes, which fail to capture the complex
relationships between modalities. Our study proposes a novel Mixture of Experts
(MoE) framework for multimodal cold-start recommendation, named MAMEX, which
dynamically leverages latent representation from different modalities. MAMEX
utilizes modality-specific expert networks and introduces a learnable gating
mechanism that adaptively weights the contribution of each modality based on
its content characteristics. This approach enables MAMEX to emphasize the most
informative modalities for each item while maintaining robustness when certain
modalities are less relevant or missing. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets show that MAMEX outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cold-start
scenarios, with superior accuracy and adaptability. For reproducibility, the
code has been made available on Github https://github.com/L2R-UET/MAMEX.

Method: 提出包含随机效应的持续学习框架，参数维度可无限扩展，并开发多步牛顿迭代算法以高效处理流数据。

Result: 理论证明估计量的渐近正态性，实验验证了方法在合成数据和真实数据集上的有效性。

Conclusion: 新框架为持续学习提供了通用解决方案，并通过算法优化显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: We focus on the critical challenge of handling non-stationary data streams in
online continual learning environments, where constrained storage capacity
prevents complete retention of historical data, leading to catastrophic
forgetting during sequential task training. To more effectively analyze and
address the problem of catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, we
propose a novel continual learning framework from a statistical perspective.
Our approach incorporates random effects across all model parameters and allows
the dimension of parameters to diverge to infinity, offering a general
formulation for continual learning problems. To efficiently process streaming
data, we develop a Multi-step Newton Iteration algorithm that significantly
reduces computational costs in certain scenarios by alleviating the burden of
matrix inversion. Theoretically, we derive the asymptotic normality of the
estimator, enabling subsequent statistical inference. Comprehensive validation
through synthetic data experiments and two real datasets analyses demonstrates
the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Motivation: 现有放射敏感性预测模型（如RSI）假设基因贡献均匀且忽略表达量及基因间相互作用，无法适应肿瘤异质性。

Method: 采用元学习框架，允许基因重要性随样本变化，通过微调实现样本特异性预测。

Conclusion: 元学习方法能快速适应个体样本，提高预测准确性，并揭示基因影响的上下文依赖性，为个性化治疗提供依据。

Abstract: Radiation response in cancer is shaped by complex, patient specific biology,
yet current treatment strategies often rely on uniform dose prescriptions
without accounting for tumor heterogeneity. In this study, we introduce a meta
learning framework for one-shot prediction of radiosensitivity measured by SF2
using cell line level gene expression data. Unlike the widely used
Radiosensitivity Index RSI a rank-based linear model trained on a fixed 10-gene
signature, our proposed meta-learned model allows the importance of each gene
to vary by sample through fine tuning. This flexibility addresses key
limitations of static models like RSI, which assume uniform gene contributions
across tumor types and discard expression magnitude and gene gene interactions.
Our results show that meta learning offers robust generalization to unseen
samples and performs well in tumor subgroups with high radiosensitivity
variability, such as adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma. By learning
transferable structure across tasks while preserving sample specific
adaptability, our approach enables rapid adaptation to individual samples,
improving predictive accuracy across diverse tumor subtypes while uncovering
context dependent patterns of gene influence that may inform personalized
therapy.

Conclusion: PSyNF为PFnS提供了一种高效解决方案，并展示了其与其他范式的比较优势。

Abstract: Given a relational specification between inputs and outputs as a logic
formula, the problem of functional synthesis is to automatically synthesize a
function from inputs to outputs satisfying the relation. Recently, a rich line
of work has emerged tackling this problem for specifications in different
theories, from Boolean to general first-order logic. In this paper, we launch
an investigation of this problem for the theory of Presburger Arithmetic, that
we call Presburger Functional Synthesis (PFnS). We show that PFnS can be solved
in EXPTIME and provide a matching exponential lower bound. This is unlike the
case for Boolean functional synthesis (BFnS), where only conditional
exponential lower bounds are known. Further, we show that PFnS for one input
and one output variable is as hard as BFnS in general. We then identify a
special normal form, called PSyNF, for the specification formula that
guarantees poly-time and poly-size solvability of PFnS. We prove several
properties of PSyNF, including how to check and compile to this form, and
conditions under which any other form that guarantees poly-time solvability of
PFnS can be compiled in poly-time to PSyNF. Finally, we identify a syntactic
normal form that is easier to check but is exponentially less succinct than
PSyNF.

Conclusion: 通过动态操作settle(φ)实现从推测到事实的过渡，为认知状态更新提供了形式化工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new family of cognitive modal logics designed to
formalize conjectural reasoning: a modal system in which cognitive contexts
extend known facts with hypothetical assumptions to explore their consequences.
Unlike traditional doxastic and epistemic systems, conjectural logics rely on a
principle, called Axiom C ($\varphi \rightarrow \Box\varphi$), that ensures
that all established facts are preserved across hypothetical layers. While
Axiom C was dismissed in the past due to its association with modal collapse,
we show that the collapse only arises under classical and bivalent assumptions,
and specifically in the presence of Axiom T. Hence we avoid Axiom T and adopt a
paracomplete semantic framework, grounded in Weak Kleene logic or Description
Logic, where undefined propositions coexist with modal assertions. This
prevents the modal collapse and guarantees a layering to distinguish between
factual and conjectural statements. Under this framework we define new modal
systems, e.g., KC and KDC, and show that they are complete, decidable, and
robust under partial knowledge. Finally, we introduce a dynamic operation,
$\mathsf{settle}(\varphi)$, which formalizes the transition from conjecture to
accepted fact, capturing the event of the update of a world's cognitive state
through the resolution of uncertainty.

Conclusion: 该框架为不一致知识库中的查询提供了一种系统化的优先级关系处理方法，并通过实验验证了其可行性。

Abstract: Repair-based semantics have been extensively studied as a means of obtaining
meaningful answers to queries posed over inconsistent knowledge bases (KBs).
While several works have considered how to exploit a priority relation between
facts to select optimal repairs, the question of how to specify such
preferences remains largely unaddressed. This motivates us to introduce a
declarative rule-based framework for specifying and computing a priority
relation between conflicting facts. As the expressed preferences may contain
undesirable cycles, we consider the problem of determining when a set of
preference rules always yields an acyclic relation, and we also explore a
pragmatic approach that extracts an acyclic relation by applying various cycle
removal techniques. Towards an end-to-end system for querying inconsistent KBs,
we present a preliminary implementation and experimental evaluation of the
framework, which employs answer set programming to evaluate the preference
rules, apply the desired cycle resolution techniques to obtain a priority
relation, and answer queries under prioritized-repair semantics.

Abstract: Digital Twins (DTs) offer powerful tools for managing complex infrastructure
systems, but their effectiveness is often limited by challenges in integrating
unstructured knowledge. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) bring
new potential to address this gap, with strong abilities in extracting and
organizing diverse textual information. We therefore propose LSDTs
(LLM-Augmented Semantic Digital Twins), a framework that helps LLMs extract
planning knowledge from unstructured documents like environmental regulations
and technical guidelines, and organize it into a formal ontology. This ontology
forms a semantic layer that powers a digital twin-a virtual model of the
physical system-allowing it to simulate realistic, regulation-aware planning
scenarios. We evaluate LSDTs through a case study of offshore wind farm
planning in Maryland, including its application during Hurricane Sandy. Results
demonstrate that LSDTs support interpretable, regulation-aware layout
optimization, enable high-fidelity simulation, and enhance adaptability in
infrastructure planning. This work shows the potential of combining generative
AI with digital twins to support complex, knowledge-driven planning tasks.

Abstract: Accurately assessing the perceptual quality of face images is crucial,
especially with the rapid progress in face restoration and generation.
Traditional quality assessment methods often struggle with the unique
characteristics of face images, limiting their generalizability. While
learning-based approaches demonstrate superior performance due to their strong
fitting capabilities, their high complexity typically incurs significant
computational and storage costs, hindering practical deployment. To address
this, we propose a lightweight face quality assessment network with Multi-Stage
Progressive Training (MSPT). Our network employs a three-stage progressive
training strategy that gradually introduces more diverse data samples and
increases input image resolution. This novel approach enables lightweight
networks to achieve high performance by effectively learning complex quality
features while significantly mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our MSPT
achieved the second highest score on the VQualA 2025 face image quality
assessment benchmark dataset, demonstrating that MSPT achieves comparable or
better performance than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining efficient
inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AVSR方法多为单向增强或对称融合，难以捕捉音频-视觉数据的异质性和互补性，尤其是在信息不对称条件下。

Method: 提出AD-AVSR框架，采用音频双流编码策略和双向模态增强模块（音频感知视觉细化模块和跨模态噪声抑制掩码模块），并结合阈值选择机制过滤弱相关数据。

Result: 在LRS2和LRS3数据集上，AD-AVSR在性能和噪声鲁棒性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AD-AVSR通过双向信息流和鲁棒性设计，显著提升了音频-视觉语音识别的效果。

Abstract: Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) combines audio-visual modalities to
improve speech recognition, especially in noisy environments. However, most
existing methods deploy the unidirectional enhancement or symmetric fusion
manner, which limits their capability to capture heterogeneous and
complementary correlations of audio-visual data-especially under asymmetric
information conditions. To tackle these gaps, we introduce a new AVSR framework
termed AD-AVSR based on bidirectional modality enhancement. Specifically, we
first introduce the audio dual-stream encoding strategy to enrich audio
representations from multiple perspectives and intentionally establish
asymmetry to support subsequent cross-modal interactions. The enhancement
process involves two key components, Audio-aware Visual Refinement Module for
enhanced visual representations under audio guidance, and Cross-modal Noise
Suppression Masking Module which refines audio representations using visual
cues, collaboratively leading to the closed-loop and bidirectional information
flow. To further enhance correlation robustness, we adopt a threshold-based
selection mechanism to filter out irrelevant or weakly correlated audio-visual
pairs. Extensive experimental results on the LRS2 and LRS3 datasets indicate
that our AD-AVSR consistently surpasses SOTA methods in both performance and
noise robustness, highlighting the effectiveness of our model design.

TL;DR: VGGSounder数据集存在标注不完整、类别重叠和模态不对齐等问题，导致评估失真。作者提出重新标注的多标签测试集VGGSounder，以更精确评估音频-视觉基础模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VGGSounder数据集在评估多模态理解时存在局限性，需改进以更准确反映模型性能。

Method: 重新标注VGGSound数据集，构建多标签测试集VGGSounder，并引入模态混淆指标分析性能下降。

Result: VGGSounder提供了详细的模态标注，能更精确评估模型性能，并揭示多模态输入时的局限性。

Conclusion: VGGSounder解决了现有数据集的不足，为音频-视觉基础模型的评估提供了更可靠的基准。

Abstract: The emergence of audio-visual foundation models underscores the importance of
reliably assessing their multi-modal understanding. The VGGSounder dataset is
commonly used as a benchmark for evaluation audio-visual classification.
However, our analysis identifies several limitations of VGGSounder, including
incomplete labelling, partially overlapping classes, and misaligned modalities.
These lead to distorted evaluations of auditory and visual capabilities. To
address these limitations, we introduce VGGSounder, a comprehensively
re-annotated, multi-label test set that extends VGGSound and is specifically
designed to evaluate audio-visual foundation models. VGGSounder features
detailed modality annotations, enabling precise analyses of modality-specific
performance. Furthermore, we reveal model limitations by analysing performance
degradation when adding another input modality with our new modality confusion
metric.

Result: 数值实验验证了有效势能的正确性，适用于人工数据分布。

Conclusion: 该方法通过简化时间反转机制，为生成扩散模型提供了一种新思路。

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models generate samples from a complex underlying data
distribution by time-reversal of a diffusion process and represent the
state-of-the-art in many generative AI applications such as artificial image
synthesis. Here, I show how a generative diffusion model can be implemented
based on an underlying active particle process with finite correlation time. In
contrast to previous approaches that use a score function acting on the
velocity coordinate of the active particle, time reversal is here achieved by
imposing an effective time-dependent potential on the position coordinate only.
The effective potential is valid to first order in the persistence time and
leads to a force field that is fully determined by the standard score function
and its derivatives up to 2nd order. Numerical experiments for artificial data
distributions confirm the validity of the effective potential.

TL;DR: NBF是一种混合神经物理框架，用于高效且可解释的空间波束RSRP预测，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在密集多用户无线网络中，准确预测波束级RSRP对波束管理至关重要，但高测量开销和快速信道变化带来挑战。

Method: 提出MCPP概念，结合Transformer DNN和物理模块，采用预训练校准策略。

Result: NBF在预测精度、训练效率和泛化能力上显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: NBF为下一代密集无线网络提供了可扩展且物理基础扎实的智能波束管理方案。

Abstract: Accurately predicting beam-level reference signal received power (RSRP) is
essential for beam management in dense multi-user wireless networks, yet
challenging due to high measurement overhead and fast channel variations. This
paper proposes Neural Beam Field (NBF), a hybrid neural-physical framework for
efficient and interpretable spatial beam RSRP prediction. Central to our
approach is the introduction of the Multi-path Conditional Power Profile
(MCPP), which bridges site-specific multipath propagation with antenna/beam
configurations via closed-form analytical modeling. We adopt a decoupled
``blackbox-whitebox" design: a Transformer-based deep neural network (DNN)
learns the MCPP from sparse user measurements and positions, while a
physics-inspired module analytically infers beam RSRP statistics. To improve
convergence and adaptivity, we further introduce a Pretrain-and-Calibrate (PaC)
strategy that leverages ray-tracing priors and on-site calibration using RSRP
data. Extensive simulations results demonstrate that NBF significantly
outperforms conventional table-based channel knowledge maps (CKMs) and pure
blackbox DNNs in prediction accuracy, training efficiency, and generalization,
while maintaining a compact model size. The proposed framework offers a
scalable and physically grounded solution for intelligent beam management in
next-generation dense wireless networks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于神经通道知识图（CKM）的新型调度框架，用于解决智能反射面（IRS）在多用户系统中的路径损耗和调度复杂性问题。通过Transformer深度神经网络预测链路功率统计和频谱效率，并结合低复杂度调度算法SM-IB，显著提升了性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能反射面（IRS）在下一代无线网络中具有潜力，但面临严重的双路径损耗和多用户调度复杂性。主动IRS部分解决了路径损耗问题，但仍需高效的调度方法。

Method: 设计了基于Transformer的深度神经网络（LPS-Net和SE-Net），预测链路功率统计和频谱效率；并提出了低复杂度的SM-IB调度算法。

Result: 神经CKM显著提高了预测精度和计算效率，SM-IB算法以低复杂度实现了接近最优的最大-最小吞吐量。

Conclusion: 该框架为多IRS多用户系统提供了高效的调度解决方案，显著提升了性能和实用性。

Abstract: Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRSs) have potential for significant
performance gains in next-generation wireless networks but face key challenges,
notably severe double-pathloss and complex multi-user scheduling due to
hardware constraints. Active IRSs partially address pathloss but still require
efficient scheduling in cell-level multi-IRS multi-user systems, whereby the
overhead/delay of channel state acquisition and the scheduling complexity both
rise dramatically as the user density and channel dimensions increase.
Motivated by these challenges, this paper proposes a novel scheduling framework
based on neural Channel Knowledge Map (CKM), designing Transformer-based deep
neural networks (DNNs) to predict ergodic spectral efficiency (SE) from
historical channel/throughput measurements tagged with user positions.
Specifically, two cascaded networks, LPS-Net and SE-Net, are designed to
predict link power statistics (LPS) and ergodic SE accurately. We further
propose a low-complexity Stable Matching-Iterative Balancing (SM-IB) scheduling
algorithm. Numerical evaluations verify that the proposed neural CKM
significantly enhances prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, while
the SM-IB algorithm effectively achieves near-optimal max-min throughput with
greatly reduced complexity.

Conclusion: 差分隐私无线联邦蒸馏框架有效提升了通信效率和隐私保护，适用于大规模学习模型。

Abstract: The ever-growing learning model size nowadays challenges the communication
efficiency and privacy preservation of the traditional federated learning (FL).
In this paper, we propose a novel differentially private (DP) over-the-air
federated distillation (FD) framework, where wireless devices (WDs)
periodically share noise-perturbed model outputs with the parameter server by
harnessing the superposition property of multi-access channels. Accordingly,
over-the-air FD enables the shared responsibility of the DP preservation on the
low-dimensional disclosed signals among WDs. We study the
communication-learning co-design problem in differentially private over-the-air
FD, aiming to maximize the learning convergence rate while meeting the transmit
power and DP requirements of WDs. The main challenge is rooted in the
intractable learning and privacy analysis in over-the-air FD, together with the
strong coupling among the decision variables spanning two timescales. To tackle
this problem, we first derive the analytical learning convergence rate and
privacy losses of WDs, based on which the optimal transceiver design per FD
round and long-term training rounds decision are obtained in the closed forms.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed differentially private
over-the-air FD approach achieves a better learning-privacy trade-off with
largely-reduced communication overhead than the conventional FL benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代通信系统需要不同可靠性级别的错误保护，但现有基于AE的UEP编码在中等块长度下复杂度高，应用受限。

Method: 采用叠加编码和连续干扰消除（SIC）解码的结构化AE架构，将编码和解码分解为更小的AE子块。

Result: 数值结果表明，该方法优于传统的随机叠加编码UEP方案，提高了可扩展性和效率。

Conclusion: 结构化AE-based UEP编码为下一代网络提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Unequal error protection (UEP) coding that enables differentiated reliability
levels within a transmitted message is essential for modern communication
systems. Autoencoder (AE)-based code designs have shown promise in the context
of learned equal error protection (EEP) coding schemes. However, their
application to UEP remains largely unexplored, particularly at intermediate
blocklengths, due to the increasing complexity of AE-based models. Inspired by
the proven effectiveness of superposition coding and successive interference
cancellation (SIC) decoding in conventional UEP schemes, we propose a
structured AE-based architecture that extends AE-based UEP codes to
substantially larger blocklengths while maintaining efficient training. By
structuring encoding and decoding into smaller AE subblocks, our method
provides a flexible framework for fine-tuning UEP reliability levels while
adapting to diverse system parameters. Numerical results show that the proposed
approach improves over established achievability bounds of randomized
superposition coding-based UEP schemes with SIC decoding, making the proposed
structured AE-based UEP codes a scalable and efficient solution for
next-generation networks.

Motivation: 码本生成语义通信系统因仅需传输索引而受关注，但码向量语义关系与索引距离无关，系统性能易受信道噪声影响，需提升鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 所提出的生成语义通信方法在鲁棒性和图像质量上优于传统方法，验证了码本辅助Transformer的有效性。

Abstract: Codebook-based generative semantic communication attracts increasing
attention, since only indices are required to be transmitted when the codebook
is shared between transmitter and receiver. However, due to the fact that the
semantic relations among code vectors are not necessarily related to the
distance of the corresponding code indices, the performance of the
codebook-enabled semantic communication system is susceptible to the channel
noise. Thus, how to improve the system robustness against the noise requires
careful design. This paper proposes a robust codebook-assisted image semantic
communication system, where semantic codec and codebook are first jointly
constructed, and then vector-to-index transformer is designed guided by the
codebook to eliminate the effects of channel noise, and achieve image
generation. Thanks to the assistance of the high-quality codebook to the
Transformer, the generated images at the receiver outperform those of the
compared methods in terms of visual perception. In the end, numerical results
and generated images demonstrate the advantages of the generative semantic
communication method over JPEG+LDPC and traditional joint source channel coding
(JSCC) methods.

Motivation: 当前语义通信中的JSCC与现有系统不兼容且无法适应源或信道的变化，而SSCC在有限块长下表现不佳。

Method: 提出ASCC方案，结合DNN语义源编码和传统数字信道编码，通过逻辑回归建模端到端失真，并采用逐次凸近似优化问题。

Result: 仿真结果表明ASCC在单信道和多信道场景下优于典型的深度JSCC和SSCC方案，且与数字系统完全兼容。

Conclusion: ASCC方案有效解决了语义通信中的兼容性和自适应问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Semantic communications (SemComs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for
joint data and task-oriented transmissions, combining the demands for both the
bit-accurate delivery and end-to-end (E2E) distortion minimization. However,
current joint source-channel coding (JSCC) in SemComs is not compatible with
the existing communication systems and cannot adapt to the variations of the
sources or the channels, while separate source-channel coding (SSCC) is
suboptimal in the finite blocklength regime. To address these issues, we
propose an adaptive source-channel coding (ASCC) scheme for SemComs over
parallel Gaussian channels, where the deep neural network (DNN)-based semantic
source coding and conventional digital channel coding are separately deployed
and adaptively designed. To enable efficient adaptation between the source and
channel coding, we first approximate the E2E data and semantic distortions as
functions of source coding rate and bit error ratio (BER) via logistic
regression, where BER is further modeled as functions of signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) and channel coding rate. Then, we formulate the weighted sum E2E
distortion minimization problem for joint source-channel coding rate and power
allocation over parallel channels, which is solved by the successive convex
approximation. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ASCC
scheme outperforms typical deep JSCC and SSCC schemes for both the single- and
parallel-channel scenarios while maintaining full compatibility with practical
digital systems.

Conclusion: 结论指出，该方法为单个网络实例提供了可计算的描述符，揭示了传统指标无法捕捉的结构特性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This work presents a statistical mechanics characterization of neural
networks, motivated by the replica symmetry breaking (RSB) phenomenon in spin
glasses. A Hopfield-type spin glass model is constructed from a given
feedforward neural network (FNN). Overlaps between simulated replica samples
serve as a characteristic descriptor of the FNN. The connection between the
spin-glass description and commonly studied properties of the FNN -- such as
data fitting, capacity, generalization, and robustness -- has been investigated
and empirically demonstrated. Unlike prior analytical studies that focus on
model ensembles, this method provides a computable descriptor for individual
network instances, which reveals nontrivial structural properties that are not
captured by conventional metrics such as loss or accuracy. Preliminary results
suggests its potential for practical applications such as model inspection,
safety verification, and detection of hidden vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: 该方法为生成模型输出来源的验证提供了有效解决方案，即使在对抗性环境下也能保持高精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly adopted in high-stakes domains, yet
current deployments offer no mechanisms to verify the origin of model outputs.
We address this gap by extending model fingerprinting techniques beyond the
traditional collaborative setting to one where the model provider may act
adversarially. To our knowledge, this is the first work to evaluate
fingerprinting for provenance attribution under such a threat model. The
methods rely on a trusted verifier that extracts secret fingerprints from the
model's output space, unknown to the provider, and trains a model to predict
and verify them. Our empirical evaluation shows that our methods achieve
near-zero FPR@95%TPR for instances of GAN and diffusion models, even when
tested on small modifications to the original architecture and training data.
Moreover, the methods remain robust against adversarial attacks that actively
modify the outputs to bypass detection. Source codes are available at

Conclusion: 为构建适应威胁环境演变的恶意软件检测系统提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Graph-based malware classifiers can achieve over 94% accuracy on standard
Android datasets, yet we find they suffer accuracy drops of up to 45% when
evaluated on previously unseen malware variants from the same family - a
scenario where strong generalization would typically be expected. This
highlights a key limitation in existing approaches: both the model
architectures and their structure-only representations often fail to capture
deeper semantic patterns. In this work, we propose a robust semantic enrichment
framework that enhances function call graphs with contextual features,
including function-level metadata and, when available, code embeddings derived
from large language models. The framework is designed to operate under
real-world constraints where feature availability is inconsistent, and supports
flexible integration of semantic signals. To evaluate generalization under
realistic domain and temporal shifts, we introduce two new benchmarks:
MalNet-Tiny-Common and MalNet-Tiny-Distinct, constructed using malware family
partitioning to simulate cross-family generalization and evolving threat
behavior. Experiments across multiple graph neural network backbones show that
our method improves classification performance by up to 8% under distribution
shift and consistently enhances robustness when integrated with
adaptation-based methods. These results offer a practical path toward building
resilient malware detection systems in evolving threat environments.

Motivation: 现有联邦遗忘方法依赖服务器合作，可能泄露客户意图和身份，EFU旨在解决这一问题。

Method: EFU利用功能加密绑定加密更新到特定聚合函数，并引入对抗性示例和参数重要性正则化来掩盖行为变化。

Result: 实验表明，EFU在遗忘数据上接近随机准确率，同时保持与完全重新训练相当的性能。

Conclusion: EFU支持任何客户侧联邦遗忘机制，提供安全、功能隐藏和可验证的遗忘。

Abstract: Federated unlearning (FU) algorithms allow clients in federated settings to
exercise their ''right to be forgotten'' by removing the influence of their
data from a collaboratively trained model. Existing FU methods maintain data
privacy by performing unlearning locally on the client-side and sending
targeted updates to the server without exposing forgotten data; yet they often
rely on server-side cooperation, revealing the client's intent and identity
without enforcement guarantees - compromising autonomy and unlearning privacy.
In this work, we propose EFU (Enforced Federated Unlearning), a
cryptographically enforced FU framework that enables clients to initiate
unlearning while concealing its occurrence from the server. Specifically, EFU
leverages functional encryption to bind encrypted updates to specific
aggregation functions, ensuring the server can neither perform unauthorized
computations nor detect or skip unlearning requests. To further mask behavioral
and parameter shifts in the aggregated model, we incorporate auxiliary
unlearning losses based on adversarial examples and parameter importance
regularization. Extensive experiments show that EFU achieves near-random
accuracy on forgotten data while maintaining performance comparable to full
retraining across datasets and neural architectures - all while concealing
unlearning intent from the server. Furthermore, we demonstrate that EFU is
agnostic to the underlying unlearning algorithm, enabling secure,
function-hiding, and verifiable unlearning for any client-side FU mechanism
that issues targeted updates.

Abstract: With the rise of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a variety of digital
watermarking techniques, embedding either 1D bitstreams or 2D images, are used
for copyright protection. However, the robustness of these watermarking
techniques against potential attacks remains underexplored. This paper
introduces the first universal black-box attack framework, the Group-based
Multi-objective Evolutionary Attack (GMEA), designed to challenge these
watermarking systems. We formulate the attack as a large-scale multi-objective
optimization problem, balancing watermark removal with visual quality. In a
black-box setting, we introduce an indirect objective function that blinds the
watermark detector by minimizing the standard deviation of features extracted
by a convolutional network, thus rendering the feature maps uninformative. To
manage the vast search space of 3DGS models, we employ a group-based
optimization strategy to partition the model into multiple, independent
sub-optimization problems. Experiments demonstrate that our framework
effectively removes both 1D and 2D watermarks from mainstream 3DGS watermarking
methods while maintaining high visual fidelity. This work reveals critical
vulnerabilities in existing 3DGS copyright protection schemes and calls for the
development of more robust watermarking systems.

Conclusion: ChimeraLog为ITD研究提供了更具挑战性和实用性的数据集，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Insider threats, which can lead to severe losses, remain a major security
concern. While machine learning-based insider threat detection (ITD) methods
have shown promising results, their progress is hindered by the scarcity of
high-quality data. Enterprise data is sensitive and rarely accessible, while
publicly available datasets, when limited in scale due to cost, lack sufficient
real-world coverage; and when purely synthetic, they fail to capture rich
semantics and realistic user behavior. To address this, we propose Chimera, the
first large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework that automatically
simulates both benign and malicious insider activities and collects diverse
logs across diverse enterprise environments. Chimera models each employee with
agents that have role-specific behavior and integrates modules for group
meetings, pairwise interactions, and autonomous scheduling, capturing realistic
organizational dynamics. It incorporates 15 types of insider attacks (e.g., IP
theft, system sabotage) and has been deployed to simulate activities in three
sensitive domains: technology company, finance corporation, and medical
institution, producing a new dataset, ChimeraLog. We assess ChimeraLog via

TL;DR: 5G和O-RAN架构带来了灵活性，但也引入了新的安全挑战，如恶意xApps通过Unicode篡改数据（hypoglyphs）绕过传统ML检测。研究发现LLMs能处理篡改数据且不崩溃，适合Near-RT RIC部署，但检测精度需提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G和O-RAN的开放性和复杂性带来了新的安全威胁，如数据篡改攻击，传统ML方法无法有效应对。

Method: 研究采用LLMs进行异常检测，测试其对hypoglyphs数据的处理能力和检测性能。

Result: LLMs能稳定处理篡改数据，检测延迟低（<0.07秒），但初始检测精度需改进。

Conclusion: LLMs在对抗hypoglyphs攻击中表现稳健，适合O-RAN部署，未来可通过提示工程提升精度。

Abstract: The introduction of 5G and the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture
has enabled more flexible and intelligent network deployments. However, the
increased complexity and openness of these architectures also introduce novel
security challenges, such as data manipulation attacks on the semi-standardised
Shared Data Layer (SDL) within the O-RAN platform through malicious xApps. In
particular, malicious xApps can exploit this vulnerability by introducing
subtle Unicode-wise alterations (hypoglyphs) into the data that are being used
by traditional machine learning (ML)-based anomaly detection methods. These
Unicode-wise manipulations can potentially bypass detection and cause failures
in anomaly detection systems based on traditional ML, such as AutoEncoders,
which are unable to process hypoglyphed data without crashing. We investigate
the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for anomaly detection within the O-RAN
architecture to address this challenge. We demonstrate that LLM-based xApps
maintain robust operational performance and are capable of processing
manipulated messages without crashing. While initial detection accuracy
requires further improvements, our results highlight the robustness of LLMs to
adversarial attacks such as hypoglyphs in input data. There is potential to use
their adaptability through prompt engineering to further improve the accuracy,
although this requires further research. Additionally, we show that LLMs
achieve low detection latency (under 0.07 seconds), making them suitable for
Near-Real-Time (Near-RT) RIC deployments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对联邦自监督学习（FSSL）的隐蔽且有效的后门攻击方法IPBA，解决了现有方法在隐蔽性和实用性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FSSL结合了去中心化建模和无监督表示学习的优势，但易受后门攻击。现有方法的触发机制过于明显，难以满足实际部署的隐蔽性和实用性需求。

Method: IPBA通过解耦后门样本和增强样本的特征分布，并引入Sliced-Wasserstein距离来优化触发生成过程，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Result: 实验表明，IPBA在多个FSSL场景和数据集上显著优于现有后门攻击方法，并在多种防御机制下表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: IPBA为FSSL中的后门攻击提供了一种更隐蔽和有效的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Federated self-supervised learning (FSSL) combines the advantages of
decentralized modeling and unlabeled representation learning, serving as a
cutting-edge paradigm with strong potential for scalability and privacy
preservation. Although FSSL has garnered increasing attention, research
indicates that it remains vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing methods
generally rely on visually obvious triggers, which makes it difficult to meet
the requirements for stealth and practicality in real-world deployment. In this
paper, we propose an imperceptible and effective backdoor attack method against
FSSL, called IPBA. Our empirical study reveals that existing imperceptible
triggers face a series of challenges in FSSL, particularly limited
transferability, feature entanglement with augmented samples, and
out-of-distribution properties. These issues collectively undermine the
effectiveness and stealthiness of traditional backdoor attacks in FSSL. To
overcome these challenges, IPBA decouples the feature distributions of backdoor
and augmented samples, and introduces Sliced-Wasserstein distance to mitigate
the out-of-distribution properties of backdoor samples, thereby optimizing the
trigger generation process. Our experimental results on several FSSL scenarios
and datasets show that IPBA significantly outperforms existing backdoor attack
methods in performance and exhibits strong robustness under various defense
mechanisms.

extensions. Combined with previous results, this work provides another example
of a new paradigm in mathematical research driven by machine learning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
knowledge-intensive tasks across domains. In materials science, to find novel
materials for various energy efficient devices for various real-world
applications, requires several time and cost expensive simulations and
experiments. In order to tune down the uncharted material search space,
minimizing the experimental cost, LLMs can play a bigger role to first provide
an accelerated search of promising known material candidates. Furthermore, the
integration of LLMs with domain-specific information via retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) is poised to revolutionize how researchers predict materials
structures, analyze defects, discover novel compounds, and extract knowledge
from literature and databases. In motivation to the potentials of LLMs and RAG
in accelerating material discovery, this paper presents a broad and systematic
review to examine the recent advancements in applying LLMs and RAG to key
materials science problems. We survey state-of-the-art developments in crystal
structure prediction, defect analysis, materials discovery, literature mining,
database integration, and multi-modal retrieval, highlighting how combining
LLMs with external knowledge sources enables new capabilities. We discuss the
performance, limitations, and implications of these approaches, and outline
future directions for leveraging LLMs to accelerate materials research and
discovery for advancement in technologies in the area of electronics, optics,

Method: 结合预训练的GAN和属性预测模型，通过梯度优化的潜在空间生成满足用户定义目标的合金成分和加工参数。

Result: 实验验证了五种NiTi基SMAs，其中Ni49.8Ti26.4Hf18.6Zr5.2合金表现出优异的性能（转变温度404°C，机械功输出9.9 J/cm³）。

Conclusion: GAN反演为复杂合金的性能导向设计提供了一种高效且通用的方法。

Abstract: The design of shape memory alloys (SMAs) with high transformation
temperatures and large mechanical work output remains a longstanding challenge
in functional materials engineering. Here, we introduce a data-driven framework
based on generative adversarial network (GAN) inversion for the inverse design
of high-performance SMAs. By coupling a pretrained GAN with a property
prediction model, we perform gradient-based latent space optimization to
directly generate candidate alloy compositions and processing parameters that
satisfy user-defined property targets. The framework is experimentally
validated through the synthesis and characterization of five NiTi-based SMAs.
Among them, the Ni$_{49.8}$Ti$_{26.4}$Hf$_{18.6}$Zr$_{5.2}$ alloy achieves a
high transformation temperature of 404 $^\circ$C, a large mechanical work
output of 9.9 J/cm$^3$, a transformation enthalpy of 43 J/g , and a thermal
hysteresis of 29 {\deg}C, outperforming existing NiTi alloys. The enhanced
performance is attributed to a pronounced transformation volume change and a
finely dispersed of Ti$_2$Ni-type precipitates, enabled by sluggish Zr and Hf
diffusion, and semi-coherent interfaces with localized strain fields. This
study demonstrates that GAN inversion offers an efficient and generalizable
route for the property-targeted discovery of complex alloys.

Method: 开发了一种增强的重建算法，从单张2D SEM图像生成3D孔网络，保持关键统计特性并复现复杂孔形态。

Result: 应用于商业微滤膜时，生成高保真3D重建，并与X射线断层扫描数据验证，显示结构指标高度一致，且在解析细微孔特征时分辨率更高。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于各向同性多孔膜结构，未来需进一步研究各向异性膜的3D重建。

Abstract: A major limitation of two-dimensional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in
imaging porous membranes is its inability to resolve three-dimensional pore
architecture and interconnectivity, which are critical factors governing
membrane performance. Although conventional tomographic 3-D reconstruction
techniques can address this limitation, they are often expensive, technically
challenging, and not widely accessible. We previously introduced a
proof-of-concept method for reconstructing a membrane's 3-D pore network from a
single 2-D SEM image, yielding statistically equivalent results to those
obtained from 3-D tomography. However, this initial approach struggled to
replicate the diverse pore geometries commonly observed in real membranes. In
this study, we advance the methodology by developing an enhanced reconstruction
algorithm that not only maintains essential statistical properties (e.g., pore
size distribution), but also accurately reproduces intricate pore morphologies.
Applying this technique to a commercial microfiltration membrane, we generated
a high-fidelity 3-D reconstruction and derived key membrane properties.
Validation with X-ray tomography data revealed excellent agreement in
structural metrics, with our SEM-based approach achieving superior resolution
in resolving fine pore features. The tool can be readily applied to isotropic
porous membrane structures of any pore size, as long as those pores can be
visualized by SEM. Further work is needed for 3-D structure generation of
anisotropic membranes.

Abstract: The quest for effective quantum feature maps for data encoding presents
significant challenges, particularly due to the flat training landscapes and
lengthy training processes associated with parameterised quantum circuits. To
address these issues, we propose an evolutionary training-free quantum
architecture search (QAS) framework that employs circuit-based heuristics
focused on trainability, hardware robustness, generalisation ability,
expressivity, complexity, and kernel-target alignment. By ranking circuit
architectures with various proxies, we reduce evaluation costs and incorporate
hardware-aware circuits to enhance robustness against noise. We evaluate our
approach on classification tasks (using quantum support vector machine) across
diverse datasets using both artificial and quantum-generated datasets. Our
approach demonstrates competitive accuracy on both simulators and real quantum
hardware, surpassing state-of-the-art QAS methods in terms of sampling
efficiency and achieving up to a 2x speedup in architecture search runtime.

Motivation: 随着LLM能力的增强，自然语言提示作为人机交互的接口，其质量对输出结果至关重要。现有提示工程方法虽提供了一些实践，但仍存在歧义问题。

Method: 提出CNL-P，结合提示工程和软件工程原则，引入精确语法和语义规范，并开发了NL2CNL-P转换工具和语法检查工具。

Result: 实验表明，CNL-P显著提升了LLM输出的质量和一致性。

Conclusion: CNL-P为基于自然语言的新编程范式奠定了基础，有望弥合提示工程与传统软件工程之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: With the growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs), they are
increasingly applied in areas like intelligent customer service, code
generation, and knowledge management. Natural language (NL) prompts act as the
``APIs'' for human-LLM interaction. To improve prompt quality, best practices
for prompt engineering (PE) have been developed, including writing guidelines
and templates. Building on this, we propose Controlled NL for Prompt (CNL-P),
which not only incorporates PE best practices but also draws on key principles
from software engineering (SE). CNL-P introduces precise grammar structures and
strict semantic norms, further eliminating NL's ambiguity, allowing for a
declarative but structured and accurate expression of user intent. This helps
LLMs better interpret and execute the prompts, leading to more consistent and
higher-quality outputs. We also introduce an NL2CNL-P conversion tool based on
LLMs, enabling users to write prompts in NL, which are then transformed into
CNL-P format, thus lowering the learning curve of CNL-P. In particular, we
develop a linting tool that checks CNL-P prompts for syntactic and semantic
accuracy, applying static analysis techniques to NL for the first time.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CNL-P enhances the quality of LLM
responses through the novel and organic synergy of PE and SE. We believe that
CNL-P can bridge the gap between emerging PE and traditional SE, laying the
foundation for a new programming paradigm centered around NL.

Conclusion: CODE2BENCH提供了一种语言无关的动态基准构建方法，为全面评估LLM在真实软件开发任务中的表现奠定了基础。

Abstract: As large language models LLMs) become increasingly integrated into software
development workflows, rigorously evaluating their performance on complex,
real-world code generation tasks has become essential. However, existing
benchmarks often suffer from data contamination and limited test rigor,
constraining their ability to reveal model failures effectively. To address
these, we present CODE2BENCH, a end-to-end pipeline for dynamically
constructing robust and contamination-resistant benchmarks from real-world
GitHub repositories. Specifically, CODE2BENCH introduces three key innovations:
(1) Automated Dynamism, achieved through periodic ingestion of recent code to
minimize training data contamination; (2) Scope Graph-based dependency
analysis, which enables structured classification of functions into benchmark
instances with controlled dependency levels (distinguishing between
Self-Contained (SC) tasks for cross-language evaluation and Weakly
Self-Contained (WSC) tasks involving permitted library usage); and (3)
Property-Based Testing (PBT) for the automated synthesis of rigorous test
suites to enable thorough functional verification. Using this pipeline, we
construct CODE2BENCH-2505, the first benchmark derived from 880 recent Python
projects spanning diverse domains, comprising 1,163 code generation tasks with
100% average branch coverage on ground-truth implementations. Extensive
evaluation of 16 LLMs using CODE2BENCH-2505 reveals that models consistently
struggle with SC tasks requiring complex, non-standard logic and cross-language
transfer, while showing relatively stronger performance on WSC tasks in Python.
Our work introduces a contamination-resistant, language-agnostic methodology
for dynamic benchmark construction, offering a principled foundation for the
comprehensive and realistic evaluation of LLMs on real-world software
development tasks.

Motivation: 现有微服务提取方法采用硬聚类，导致服务间耦合增加、服务内内聚降低，Mo2oM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合深度语义嵌入和结构依赖，使用图神经网络进行软聚类，允许组件概率性归属多个微服务。

Result: 在四个开源基准测试中，Mo2oM在结构模块化、通信开销等方面显著优于现有方法，提升最高达58%。

Conclusion: Mo2oM通过软聚类方法有效优化微服务分解，提升系统性能。

Abstract: Modern software systems are increasingly shifting from monolithic
architectures to microservices to enhance scalability, maintainability, and
deployment flexibility. Existing microservice extraction methods typically rely
on hard clustering, assigning each software component to a single microservice.
This approach often increases inter-service coupling and reduces intra-service
cohesion. We propose Mo2oM (Monolithic to Overlapping Microservices), a
framework that formulates microservice extraction as a soft clustering problem,
allowing components to belong probabilistically to multiple microservices. This
approach is inspired by expert-driven decompositions, where practitioners
intentionally replicate certain software components across services to reduce
communication overhead. Mo2oM combines deep semantic embeddings with structural
dependencies extracted from methodcall graphs to capture both functional and
architectural relationships. A graph neural network-based soft clustering
algorithm then generates the final set of microservices. We evaluate Mo2oM on
four open-source monolithic benchmarks and compare it against eight
state-of-the-art baselines. Our results demonstrate that Mo2oM achieves
improvements of up to 40.97% in structural modularity (balancing cohesion and
coupling), 58% in inter-service call percentage (communication overhead),
26.16% in interface number (modularity and decoupling), and 38.96% in
non-extreme distribution (service size balance) across all benchmarks.

Result: 开发者对生成代码的满意度低（均分2.8/5），主要问题为功能不足（77%）、代码质量差（42%）和沟通问题（25%）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了CBAs的六大挑战和五大障碍，并提出了改进设计的机会。

Abstract: Recent AI code assistants have significantly improved their ability to
process more complex contexts and generate entire codebases based on a textual
description, compared to the popular snippet-level generation. These codebase
AI assistants (CBAs) can also extend or adapt codebases, allowing users to
focus on higher-level design and deployment decisions. While prior work has
extensively studied the impact of snippet-level code generation, this new class
of codebase generation models is relatively unexplored. Despite initial
anecdotal reports of excitement about these agents, they remain less frequently
adopted compared to snippet-level code assistants. To utilize CBAs better, we
need to understand how developers interact with CBAs, and how and why CBAs fall
short of developers' needs. In this paper, we explored these gaps through a
counterbalanced user study and interview with (n = 16) students and developers
working on coding tasks with CBAs. We found that participants varied the
information in their prompts, like problem description (48% of prompts),
required functionality (98% of prompts), code structure (48% of prompts), and
their prompt writing process. Despite various strategies, the overall
satisfaction score with generated codebases remained low (mean = 2.8, median =
3, on a scale of one to five). Participants mentioned functionality as the most
common factor for dissatisfaction (77% of instances), alongside poor code
quality (42% of instances) and communication issues (25% of instances). We
delve deeper into participants' dissatisfaction to identify six underlying
challenges that participants faced when using CBAs, and extracted five barriers
to incorporating CBAs into their workflows. Finally, we surveyed 21 commercial
CBAs to compare their capabilities with participant challenges and present
design opportunities for more efficient and useful CBAs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Python缺乏成熟的正式验证工具，而PyVeritas旨在填补这一空白，利用现有C语言工具对Python代码进行验证。

Method: 通过LLMs将Python代码转换为C代码，然后使用有界模型检查和MaxSAT进行故障定位。

Result: 实验表明，LLM转换的准确率可达80-90%，支持对小规模Python程序进行断言验证和故障诊断。

Conclusion: PyVeritas为Python程序提供了有效的正式验证和故障定位解决方案。

Abstract: Python has become the dominant language for general-purpose programming, yet
it lacks robust tools for formal verification. In contrast, programmers working
in languages such as C benefit from mature model checkers, for example CBMC,
which enable exhaustive symbolic reasoning and fault localisation. The inherent
complexity of Python, coupled with the verbosity and low-level nature of
existing transpilers (e.g., Cython), have historically limited the
applicability of formal verification to Python programs.
  In this paper, we propose PyVeritas, a novel framework that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) for high-level transpilation from Python to C, followed
by bounded model checking and MaxSAT-based fault localisation in the generated
C code. PyVeritas enables verification and bug localisation for Python code
using existing model checking tools for C. Our empirical evaluation on two
Python benchmarks demonstrates that LLM-based transpilation can achieve a high
degree of accuracy, up to 80--90% for some LLMs, enabling effective development
environment that supports assertion-based verification and interpretable fault
diagnosis for small yet non-trivial Python programs.

Motivation: 探索细胞自动机中自发自我复制的可能性及其形式，挑战传统人工生命系统中对个体和复制的认知。

Method: 基于Outlier规则，开发数据驱动框架，通过因果谱系重建模式，严格识别自我复制结构。

Result: 证明Outlier CA中的自我复制结构不仅自发且稳健，还常由多个独立集群协同完成。

Conclusion: 研究结果对人工生命系统中的个体性和复制概念提出了新问题。

Abstract: Spontaneous self-replication in cellular automata has long been considered
rare, with most known examples requiring careful design or artificial
initialization. In this paper, we present formal, causal evidence that such
replication can emerge unassisted -- and that it can do so in a distributed,
multi-component form. Building on prior work identifying complex dynamics in
the Outlier rule, we introduce a data-driven framework that reconstructs the
full causal ancestry of patterns in a deterministic cellular automaton. This
allows us to rigorously identify self-replicating structures via explicit
causal lineages. Our results show definitively that self-replicators in the
Outlier CA are not only spontaneous and robust, but are also often composed of
multiple disjoint clusters working in coordination, raising questions about
some conventional notions of individuality and replication in artificial life
systems.

### [623] [Energy Efficient Task Offloading in UAV-Enabled MEC Using a Fully Decentralized Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06863)
*Hamidreza Asadian-Rad,Hossein Soleimani,Shahrokh Farahmand*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种完全分散的无人机轨迹和用户分配优化方法，利用图注意力层和EPS-PPO算法，解决了集中式方法的局限性，并在性能上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多接入边缘计算（MEC）中无人机作为边缘服务器的应用需要同时满足用户服务质量和能源效率，但集中式优化存在通信开销、灵活性不足等问题。

Method: 采用完全分散式架构，无人机仅与邻近邻居通信，结合图注意力层（GAT）和经验参数共享近端策略优化（EPS-PPO）算法进行本地决策。

Result: 数值结果显示，该方法在多个性能指标上优于现有的MADDPG算法，且仅需本地通信。

Conclusion: 完全分散式方法在性能和灵活性上优于集中式和独立本地DRL方法，为无人机边缘计算提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been recently utilized in multi-access
edge computing (MEC) as edge servers. It is desirable to design UAVs'
trajectories and user to UAV assignments to ensure satisfactory service to the
users and energy efficient operation simultaneously. The posed optimization
problem is challenging to solve because: (i) The formulated problem is
non-convex, (ii) Due to the mobility of ground users, their future positions
and channel gains are not known in advance, (iii) Local UAVs' observations
should be communicated to a central entity that solves the optimization
problem. The (semi-) centralized processing leads to communication overhead,
communication/processing bottlenecks, lack of flexibility and scalability, and
loss of robustness to system failures. To simultaneously address all these
limitations, we advocate a fully decentralized setup with no centralized
entity. Each UAV obtains its local observation and then communicates with its
immediate neighbors only. After sharing information with neighbors, each UAV
determines its next position via a locally run deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) algorithm. None of the UAVs need to know the global communication graph.
Two main components of our proposed solution are (i) Graph attention layers
(GAT), and (ii) Experience and parameter sharing proximal policy optimization
(EPS-PPO). Our proposed approach eliminates all the limitations of
semi-centralized MADRL methods such as MAPPO and MA deep deterministic policy
gradient (MADDPG), while guaranteeing a better performance than independent
local DRLs such as in IPPO. Numerical results reveal notable performance gains
in several different criteria compared to the existing MADDPG algorithm,
demonstrating the potential for offering a better performance, while utilizing
local communications only.

TL;DR: AI-driven自动化系统加速并简化了SOW起草过程，通过三个智能代理分别处理起草、法律检查和格式化，显著提高了效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SOW起草过程缓慢、复杂且易出错，需要多人参与且耗时数天。

Method: 系统采用三个智能代理：一个起草初稿，一个检查法律合规性，一个负责格式化和校对。

Result: 测试显示，系统能在三分钟内完成SOW起草，远快于传统方法，且准确性和质量高。

Conclusion: AI技术可支持法律和商业专业人士，简化常规工作，提升效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Drafting a Statement of Work (SOW) is a vital part of business and legal
projects. It outlines key details like deliverables, timelines,
responsibilities, and legal terms. However, creating these documents is often a
slow and complex process. It usually involves multiple people, takes several
days, and leaves room for errors or outdated content. This paper introduces a
new AI-driven automation system that makes the entire SOW drafting process
faster, easier, and more accurate. Instead of relying completely on humans, the
system uses three intelligent components or 'agents' that each handle a part of
the job. One agent writes the first draft, another checks if everything is
legally correct, and the third agent formats the document and ensures
everything is in order. Unlike basic online tools that just fill in templates,
this system understands the meaning behind the content and customizes the SOW
to match the needs of the project. It also checks legal compliance and
formatting so that users can trust the result. The system was tested using real
business examples. It was able to create a full SOW in under three minutes,
compared to several hours or days using manual methods. It also performed well
in accuracy and quality, showing that it can reduce legal risks and save a lot
of time. This solution shows how artificial intelligence can be used to support
legal and business professionals by taking care of routine work and helping
them focus on more important decisions. It's a step toward making legal
processes smarter, faster, and more reliable.

Motivation: 探索如何将非结构化的社交媒体文本转化为结构化的多标签事件变量，并评估其在金融预测中的有效性。

Method: 利用LLM对公司相关推文进行多标签事件分类，并将情感信号与未来1-7天的回报对齐，评估统计效能和市场交易性。

Result: 某些事件标签持续产生负阿尔法，夏普比率低至-0.38，信息系数超过0.05，统计显著性达95%。

Conclusion: 社交媒体情感是金融预测中有价值但嘈杂的信号，开源框架有助于推动算法交易研究的民主化。

Abstract: In this study, we wish to showcase the unique utility of large language
models (LLMs) in financial semantic annotation and alpha signal discovery.
Leveraging a corpus of company-related tweets, we use an LLM to automatically
assign multi-label event categories to high-sentiment-intensity tweets. We
align these labeled sentiment signals with forward returns over 1-to-7-day
horizons to evaluate their statistical efficacy and market tradability. Our
experiments reveal that certain event labels consistently yield negative alpha,
with Sharpe ratios as low as -0.38 and information coefficients exceeding 0.05,
all statistically significant at the 95\% confidence level. This study
establishes the feasibility of transforming unstructured social media text into
structured, multi-label event variables. A key contribution of this work is its
commitment to transparency and reproducibility; all code and methodologies are
made publicly available. Our results provide compelling evidence that social
media sentiment is a valuable, albeit noisy, signal in financial forecasting
and underscore the potential of open-source frameworks to democratize
algorithmic trading research.

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图分析的优化框架，用于改进ENSO长期预测的集合模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MEF模型未充分利用高预测性能但分散的集合成员，限制了预测能力。

Method: 构建无向图，通过RMSE和相关性度量集合成员相似性，使用社区检测方法优化子集。

Result: 优化后的子集提高了预测技能，噪声减少且集合一致性增强。

Conclusion: 图分析方法不仅提升了预测稳定性，还具有模型无关性，适用于其他大规模集合预测模型。

Abstract: Reliable long-lead forecasting of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
remains a long-standing challenge in climate science. The previously developed
Multimodal ENSO Forecast (MEF) model uses 80 ensemble predictions by two
independent deep learning modules: a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN)
and a time-series module. In their approach, outputs of the two modules are
combined using a weighting strategy wherein one is prioritized over the other
as a function of global performance. Separate weighting or testing of
individual ensemble members did not occur, however, which may have limited the
model to optimize the use of high-performing but spread-out forecasts. In this
study, we propose a better framework that employs graph-based analysis to
directly model similarity between all 80 members of the ensemble. By
constructing an undirected graph whose vertices are ensemble outputs and whose
weights on edges measure similarity (via RMSE and correlation), we identify and
cluster structurally similar and accurate predictions. From which we obtain an
optimized subset of 20 members using community detection methods. The final
prediction is then obtained by averaging this optimized subset. This method
improves the forecast skill through noise removal and emphasis on ensemble
coherence. Interestingly, our graph-based selection shows robust statistical
characteristics among top performers, offering new ensemble behavior insights.
In addition, we observe that while the GNN-based approach does not always
outperform the baseline MEF under every scenario, it produces more stable and
consistent outputs, particularly in compound long-lead situations. The approach
is model-agnostic too, suggesting that it can be applied directly to other
forecasting models with gargantuan ensemble outputs, such as statistical,
physical, or hybrid models.

Motivation: 随着PINNs在偏微分方程求解中的应用增加，需要更通用的误差估计方法以验证其预测准确性。

Method: 修改误差界限并提出数值策略近似稳定性参数，扩展了原有半群框架的适用范围。

Result: 扩展后的框架能够验证更现实场景下的PINN预测，如圆柱绕流的斯托克斯流问题。

Conclusion: 通过改进误差估计方法，本文提升了PINN在实际问题中的可靠性和适用性。

Abstract: Rigorous error estimation is a fundamental topic in numerical analysis. With
the increasing use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving
partial differential equations, several approaches have been developed to
quantify the associated prediction error. In this work, we build upon a
semigroup-based framework previously introduced by the authors for estimating
the PINN error. While this estimator has so far been limited to academic
examples - due to the need to compute quantities related to input-to-state
stability - we extend its applicability to a significantly broader class of
problems. This is accomplished by modifying the error bound and proposing
numerical strategies to approximate the required stability parameters. The
extended framework enables the certification of PINN predictions in more
realistic scenarios, as demonstrated by a numerical study of Stokes flow around
a cylinder.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将大脑视为同质系统，忽略了功能网络的差异性，因此需要一种网络特异性的方法来优化预测。

Method: 将Yeo 7网络分为四个集群，为每个集群训练多主体、多层感知器（MLP）模型，支持集群特异性优化和自适应记忆建模。

Result: 该方法显著提升了Schaefer图谱中1000个皮质区域的预测准确性，在Algonauts Project 2025挑战中排名第八，OOD相关性分数是基线模型的两倍。

Conclusion: 网络特异性的聚类策略能有效提升脑响应预测的准确性，为多模态电影刺激下的脑功能研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this work, we present a network-specific approach for predicting brain
responses to complex multimodal movies, leveraging the Yeo 7-network
parcellation of the Schaefer atlas. Rather than treating the brain as a
homogeneous system, we grouped the seven functional networks into four clusters
and trained separate multi-subject, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models for
each. This architecture supports cluster-specific optimization and adaptive
memory modeling, allowing each model to adjust temporal dynamics and modality
weighting based on the functional role of its target network. Our results
demonstrate that this clustered strategy significantly enhances prediction
accuracy across the 1,000 cortical regions of the Schaefer atlas. The final
model achieved an eighth-place ranking in the Algonauts Project 2025 Challenge,
with out-of-distribution (OOD) correlation scores nearly double those of the

Method: 采用基于典型微电路的神经ODE架构，包含棘星状细胞、抑制性细胞和锥体细胞，形成8维动力系统。

Conclusion: 神经形态计算方法可提升人工神经网络的效率和可解释性，为基于大脑计算原理的参数高效架构提供新方向。

Abstract: The human brain represents the only known example of general intelligence
that naturally aligns with human values. On a mere 20-watt power budget, the
brain achieves robust learning and adaptive decision-making in ways that
continue to elude advanced AI systems. Inspired by the brain, we present a
computational architecture based on canonical microcircuits (CMCs) -
stereotyped patterns of neurons found ubiquitously throughout the cortex. We
implement these circuits as neural ODEs comprising spiny stellate, inhibitory,
and pyramidal neurons, forming an 8-dimensional dynamical system with
biologically plausible recurrent connections. Our experiments show that even a
single CMC node achieves 97.8 percent accuracy on MNIST, while hierarchical
configurations - with learnable inter-regional connectivity and recurrent
connections - yield improved performance on more complex image benchmarks.
Notably, our approach achieves competitive results using substantially fewer
parameters than conventional deep learning models. Phase space analysis
revealed distinct dynamical trajectories for different input classes,
highlighting interpretable, emergent behaviors observed in biological systems.
These findings suggest that neuromorphic computing approaches can improve both
efficiency and interpretability in artificial neural networks, offering new
directions for parameter-efficient architectures grounded in the computational
principles of the human brain.

Conclusion: 模型分析可生成关于人类认知的可测试假设，揭示了假设生成在预测行为中的关键作用。

Abstract: How do we predict others from patterns in their behavior and what are the
computational constraints that limit this ability? We investigate these
questions by modeling human behavior over repeated games of rock, paper,
scissors from Brockbank & Vul (2024). Against algorithmic opponents that varied
in strategic sophistication, people readily exploit simple transition patterns
(e.g., consistently playing rock after paper) but struggle to detect more
complex sequential dependencies. To understand the cognitive mechanisms
underlying these abilities and their limitations, we deploy Hypothetical Minds
(HM), a large language model-based agent that generates and tests hypotheses
about opponent strategies, as a cognitive model of this behavior (Cross et al.,
2024). We show that when applied to the same experimental conditions, HM
closely mirrors human performance patterns, succeeding and failing in similar
ways. To better understand the source of HM's failures and whether people might
face similar cognitive bottlenecks in this context, we performed a series of
ablations and augmentations targeting different components of the system. When
provided with natural language descriptions of the opponents' strategies, HM
successfully exploited 6/7 bot opponents with win rates >80% suggesting that
accurate hypothesis generation is the primary cognitive bottleneck in this
task. Further, by systematically manipulating the model's hypotheses through
pedagogically-inspired interventions, we find that the model substantially
updates its causal understanding of opponent behavior, revealing how
model-based analyses can produce testable hypotheses about human cognition.

Conclusion: 自上而下反馈与神经随机性共同作用，提升模型的鲁棒性和稳定性，揭示了双重机制在感知编码中的重要性。

Abstract: Biological systems leverage top-down feedback for visual processing, yet most
artificial vision models succeed in image classification using purely
feedforward or recurrent architectures, calling into question the functional
significance of descending cortical pathways. Here, we trained convolutional
recurrent neural networks (ConvRNN) on image classification in the presence or
absence of top-down feedback projections to elucidate the specific
computational contributions of those feedback pathways. We found that ConvRNNs
with top-down feedback exhibited remarkable speed-accuracy trade-off and
robustness to noise perturbations and adversarial attacks, but only when they
were trained with stochastic neural variability, simulated by randomly
silencing single units via dropout. By performing detailed analyses to identify
the reasons for such benefits, we observed that feedback information
substantially shaped the representational geometry of the post-integration
layer, combining the bottom-up and top-down streams, and this effect was
amplified by dropout. Moreover, feedback signals coupled with dropout optimally
constrained network activity onto a low-dimensional manifold and encoded object
information more efficiently in out-of-distribution regimes, with top-down
information stabilizing the representational dynamics at the population level.
Together, these findings uncover a dual mechanism for resilient sensory coding.
On the one hand, neural stochasticity prevents unit-level co-adaptation albeit
at the cost of more chaotic dynamics. On the other hand, top-down feedback
harnesses high-level information to stabilize network activity on compact
low-dimensional manifolds.

Motivation: 现有脉冲图神经网络主要在欧几里得空间运行，限制了其对复杂图结构（如层次结构和循环）的建模能力。

Method: GSG包含三个关键组件：黎曼嵌入层、流形脉冲层和流形学习目标，通过黎曼SGD训练。

Result: 实验表明，GSG在准确性、鲁棒性和能效上优于欧几里得SNN和基于流形的GNN。

Conclusion: GSG为曲率感知、高能效的图学习建立了新范式。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
modeling graph-structured data, while Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer high
energy efficiency through sparse, event-driven computation. However, existing
spiking GNNs predominantly operate in Euclidean space and rely on fixed
geometric assumptions, limiting their capacity to model complex graph
structures such as hierarchies and cycles. To overcome these limitations, we
propose \method{}, a novel Geometry-Aware Spiking Graph Neural Network that
unifies spike-based neural dynamics with adaptive representation learning on
Riemannian manifolds. \method{} features three key components: a Riemannian
Embedding Layer that projects node features into a pool of constant-curvature
manifolds, capturing non-Euclidean structures; a Manifold Spiking Layer that
models membrane potential evolution and spiking behavior in curved spaces via
geometry-consistent neighbor aggregation and curvature-based attention; and a
Manifold Learning Objective that enables instance-wise geometry adaptation
through jointly optimized classification and link prediction losses defined
over geodesic distances. All modules are trained using Riemannian SGD,
eliminating the need for backpropagation through time. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmarks show that GSG achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and
energy efficiency compared to both Euclidean SNNs and manifold-based GNNs,
establishing a new paradigm for curvature-aware, energy-efficient graph
learning.

Abstract: Developmental Graph Cellular Automata (DGCA) are a novel model for

this paper, we show that DGCAs can be trained to grow reservoirs. Reservoirs
are grown with two types of targets: task-driven (using the NARMA family of
tasks) and task-independent (using reservoir metrics).
  Results show that DGCAs are able to grow into a variety of specialized,
life-like structures capable of effectively solving benchmark tasks,
statistically outperforming `typical' reservoirs on the same task. Overall,
these lay the foundation for the development of DGCA systems that produce
plastic reservoirs and for modeling functional, adaptive morphogenesis.

Result: 实验证明Maestro-EVC能生成高质量、可控且情感丰富的语音。

Conclusion: Maestro-EVC在情感语音转换中表现出色，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Emotional voice conversion (EVC) aims to modify the emotional style of speech
while preserving its linguistic content. In practical EVC, controllability, the
ability to independently control speaker identity and emotional style using
distinct references, is crucial. However, existing methods often struggle to
fully disentangle these attributes and lack the ability to model fine-grained
emotional expressions such as temporal dynamics. We propose Maestro-EVC, a
controllable EVC framework that enables independent control of content, speaker
identity, and emotion by effectively disentangling each attribute from separate
references. We further introduce a temporal emotion representation and an
explicit prosody modeling with prosody augmentation to robustly capture and
transfer the temporal dynamics of the target emotion, even under
prosody-mismatched conditions. Experimental results confirm that Maestro-EVC
achieves high-quality, controllable, and emotionally expressive speech
synthesis.

While existing methods show promise, their effectiveness is often hindered by
limited datasets. In this work, we extend a multimodal approach to guitar
strumming transcription by introducing a novel dataset and a deep
learning-based transcription model. We collect 90 min of real-world guitar
recordings using an ESP32 smartwatch motion sensor and a structured recording
protocol, complemented by a synthetic dataset of 4h of labeled strumming audio.
A Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) model is trained to detect
strumming events, classify their direction, and identify the corresponding
chords using only microphone audio. Our evaluation demonstrates significant
improvements over baseline onset detection algorithms, with a hybrid method
combining synthetic and real-world data achieving the highest accuracy for both
strumming action detection and chord classification. These results highlight
the potential of deep learning for robust guitar strumming transcription and
open new avenues for automatic rhythm guitar analysis.

*Sebastian Murgul,Michael Heizmann*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过合成数据训练吉他指弹转录模型的方法，解决了真实数据稀缺和法律限制的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于标记训练数据的稀缺性和音乐录音的法律限制，自动转录吉他指弹表演具有挑战性。

Method: 采用四阶段流程生成合成数据：基于知识的指弹谱编写、MIDI表演渲染、扩展Karplus-Strong算法的物理建模、音频增强（如混响和失真）。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上训练的CRNN模型显示，合成数据可实现合理的音符追踪效果，少量真实数据微调后效果更佳。

Conclusion: 程序化生成的音频在数据稀缺的音乐信息检索任务中具有潜力。

Abstract: Automatic transcription of acoustic guitar fingerpicking performances remains
a challenging task due to the scarcity of labeled training data and legal
constraints connected with musical recordings. This work investigates a
procedural data generation pipeline as an alternative to real audio recordings
for training transcription models. Our approach synthesizes training data
through four stages: knowledge-based fingerpicking tablature composition, MIDI
performance rendering, physical modeling using an extended Karplus-Strong
algorithm, and audio augmentation including reverb and distortion. We train and
evaluate a CRNN-based note-tracking model on both real and synthetic datasets,
demonstrating that procedural data can be used to achieve reasonable
note-tracking results. Finetuning with a small amount of real data further
enhances transcription accuracy, improving over models trained exclusively on
real recordings. These results highlight the potential of procedurally
generated audio for data-scarce music information retrieval tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LALMs在音频问答中的推理能力不足，未能充分利用深度推理，且表现不及人类水平。

Method: 提出Audio-Thinker框架，结合自适应推理准确性奖励、外部奖励模型和基于思考的奖励，动态优化推理策略。

Result: 实验表明，Audio-Thinker在多个基准任务中优于现有推理导向的LALMs，表现出更强的推理和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Audio-Thinker通过强化学习有效提升了LALMs的推理能力，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models, multimodal large language
models, and large audio language models (LALMs) have significantly improved
their reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with rule-based
rewards. However, the explicit reasoning process has yet to show significant
benefits for audio question answering, and effectively leveraging deep
reasoning remains an open challenge, with LALMs still falling short of
human-level auditory-language reasoning. To address these limitations, we
propose Audio-Thinker, a reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of LALMs, with a focus on improving adaptability,
consistency, and effectiveness. Our approach introduces an adaptive think
accuracy reward, enabling the model to adjust its reasoning strategies based on
task complexity dynamically. Furthermore, we incorporate an external reward
model to evaluate the overall consistency and quality of the reasoning process,
complemented by think-based rewards that help the model distinguish between
valid and flawed reasoning paths during training. Experimental results
demonstrate that our Audio-Thinker model outperforms existing
reasoning-oriented LALMs across various benchmark tasks, exhibiting superior
reasoning and generalization capabilities.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Whisfusion框架结合Whisper编码器和文本扩散解码器，解决了自回归解码器的延迟问题，实现了并行处理长音频的高效ASR。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自回归解码器在实时语音识别中的延迟问题，同时克服非自回归方法的上下文限制。

Method: 融合Whisper编码器和文本扩散解码器，通过轻量级跨注意力适配器和批并行多步解码策略提升性能。

Result: 在LibriSpeech上WER降至8.3%，长音频处理速度比基线快2.6倍。

Conclusion: Whisfusion为长语音识别提供了高效解决方案，平衡了速度和准确性。

Abstract: Fast Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is critical for latency-sensitive
applications such as real-time captioning and meeting transcription. However,
truly parallel ASR decoding remains challenging due to the sequential nature of
autoregressive (AR) decoders and the context limitations of non-autoregressive
(NAR) methods. While modern ASR encoders can process up to 30 seconds of audio
at once, AR decoders still generate tokens sequentially, creating a latency
bottleneck. We propose Whisfusion, the first framework to fuse a pre-trained
Whisper encoder with a text diffusion decoder. This NAR architecture resolves
the AR latency bottleneck by processing the entire acoustic context in parallel
at every decoding step. A lightweight cross-attention adapter trained via
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) bridges the two modalities. We also
introduce a batch-parallel, multi-step decoding strategy that improves accuracy
by increasing the number of candidates with minimal impact on speed. Fine-tuned
solely on LibriSpeech (960h), Whisfusion achieves a lower WER than Whisper-tiny
(8.3% vs. 9.7%), and offers comparable latency on short audio. For longer
utterances (>20s), it is up to 2.6x faster than the AR baseline, establishing a
new, efficient operating point for long-form ASR. The implementation and
training scripts are available at https://github.com/taeyoun811/Whisfusion.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SEF-MK是一种新型的语音匿名化框架，通过随机选择多个k-means模型之一处理SSL表示，以保护说话人隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护说话人隐私，同时保留语言和副语言内容。

Method: 提出SEF-MK框架，使用多个k-means模型随机处理SSL表示，而非单一模型。

Result: 从用户角度看，SEF-MK更好地保留了语言和情感内容；但从攻击者角度看，隐私攻击效果增强。

Conclusion: SEF-MK框架在隐私保护和内容保留之间取得平衡，但需注意隐私攻击风险。

Abstract: Voice anonymization protects speaker privacy by concealing identity while
preserving linguistic and paralinguistic content. Self-supervised learning
(SSL) representations encode linguistic features but preserve speaker traits.
We propose a novel speaker-embedding-free framework called SEF-MK. Instead of
using a single k-means model trained on the entire dataset, SEF-MK anonymizes
SSL representations for each utterance by randomly selecting one of multiple
k-means models, each trained on a different subset of speakers. We explore this
approach from both attacker and user perspectives. Extensive experiments show
that, compared to a single k-means model, SEF-MK with multiple k-means models
better preserves linguistic and emotional content from the user's viewpoint.
However, from the attacker's perspective, utilizing multiple k-means models
boosts the effectiveness of privacy attacks. These insights can aid users in
designing voice anonymization systems to mitigate attacker threats.

Abstract: In full-duplex speech interaction systems, effective Acoustic Echo

paper presents a neural network-based AEC solution to address challenges in
mobile scenarios with varying hardware, nonlinear distortions and long latency.
We first incorporate diverse data augmentation strategies to enhance the
model's robustness across various environments. Moreover, progressive learning
is employed to incrementally improve AEC effectiveness, resulting in a
considerable improvement in speech quality. To further optimize AEC's
downstream applications, we introduce a novel post-processing strategy
employing tailored parameters designed specifically for tasks such as Voice
Activity Detection (VAD) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), thus enhancing
their overall efficacy. Finally, our method employs a small-footprint model
with streaming inference, enabling seamless deployment on mobile devices.
Empirical results demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed method in Echo

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发偏见感知检测系统的重要性，为构建符合伦理和监管标准的非歧视性检测系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Despite growing attention to deepfake speech detection, the aspects of bias
and fairness remain underexplored in the speech domain. To address this gap, we
introduce the Speaker Characteristics Deepfake (SCDF) dataset: a novel, richly
annotated resource enabling systematic evaluation of demographic biases in
deepfake speech detection. SCDF contains over 237,000 utterances in a balanced
representation of both male and female speakers spanning five languages and a
wide age range. We evaluate several state-of-the-art detectors and show that
speaker characteristics significantly influence detection performance,
revealing disparities across sex, language, age, and synthesizer type. These
findings highlight the need for bias-aware development and provide a foundation
for building non-discriminatory deepfake detection systems aligned with ethical

*Alexander Tyurin*

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study first-order methods for convex optimization problems with functions
$f$ satisfying the recently proposed $\ell$-smoothness condition
$||\nabla^{2}f(x)|| \le \ell\left(||\nabla f(x)||\right),$ which generalizes
the $L$-smoothness and $(L_{0},L_{1})$-smoothness. While accelerated gradient
descent AGD is known to reach the optimal complexity $O(\sqrt{L} R /
\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ under $L$-smoothness, where $\varepsilon$ is an error
tolerance and $R$ is the distance between a starting and an optimal point,
existing extensions to $\ell$-smoothness either incur extra dependence on the
initial gradient, suffer exponential factors in $L_{1} R$, or require costly
auxiliary sub-routines, leaving open whether an AGD-type $O(\sqrt{\ell(0)} R /
\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ rate is possible for small-$\varepsilon$, even in the
$(L_{0},L_{1})$-smoothness case.
  We resolve this open question. Leveraging a new Lyapunov function and
designing new algorithms, we achieve $O(\sqrt{\ell(0)} R / \sqrt{\varepsilon})$
oracle complexity for small-$\varepsilon$ and virtually any $\ell$. For
instance, for $(L_{0},L_{1})$-smoothness, our bound $O(\sqrt{L_0} R /
\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ is provably optimal in the small-$\varepsilon$ regime and
removes all non-constant multiplicative factors present in prior accelerated
algorithms.

Conclusion: 总结了不同求解器和学习范式的分类，并提出了泛化、混合和扩展智能求解器的开放挑战。

Abstract: Integer and mixed-integer nonlinear programming (INLP, MINLP) are central to
logistics, energy, and scheduling, but remain computationally challenging. This
survey examines how machine learning and reinforcement learning can enhance
exact optimization methods - particularly branch-and-bound (BB), without
compromising global optimality. We cover discrete, continuous, and
mixed-integer formulations, and highlight applications such as crew scheduling,
vehicle routing, and hydropower planning. We introduce a unified BB framework
that embeds learning-based strategies into branching, cut selection, node
ordering, and parameter control. Classical algorithms are augmented using
supervised, imitation, and reinforcement learning models to accelerate
convergence while maintaining correctness. We conclude with a taxonomy of
learning methods by solver class and learning paradigm, and outline open
challenges in generalization, hybridization, and scaling intelligent solvers.

Motivation: 解决广义Koopman算子和非线性基本引理这两个在非线性系统数据驱动控制方法中的关键问题。

Method: 通过状态和输入可观测函数Hilbert空间的张量积构造乘积Hilbert空间，进行正交展开，并推导无限维线性算子（广义Koopman算子）。

Result: 证明了广义Koopman算子的存在性，并提出了一种可扩展的数据驱动方法计算其有限维近似。

Conclusion: 该方法为非线性系统数据驱动控制提供了理论基础，并通过实例验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The generalization of the Koopman operator to systems with control input and
the derivation of a nonlinear fundamental lemma are two open problems that play
a key role in the development of data-driven control methods for nonlinear
systems. Both problems hinge on the construction of observable or basis
functions and their corresponding Hilbert space that enable an
infinite-dimensional, linear system representation. In this paper we derive a
novel solution to these problems based on orthonormal expansion in a product
Hilbert space constructed as the tensor product between the Hilbert spaces of
the state and input observable functions, respectively. We prove that there
exists an infinite-dimensional linear operator, i.e. the generalized Koopman
operator, from the constructed product Hilbert space to the Hilbert space
corresponding to the lifted state propagated forward in time. A scalable
data-driven method for computing finite-dimensional approximations of
generalized Koopman operators and several choices of observable functions are
also presented. Moreover, we derive a nonlinear fundamental lemma by exploiting
the bilinear structure of the infinite-dimensional generalized Koopman model.
The effectiveness of the developed generalized Koopman embedding is illustrated
on the Van der Pol oscillator.

Conclusion: 机器学习模型在高能物理实验中有潜力显著提升数据处理效率，但需结合现代硬件优化以实现最佳性能。

Abstract: As the particle physics community needs higher and higher precisions in order
to test our current model of the subatomic world, larger and larger datasets
are necessary. With upgrades scheduled for the detectors of colliding-beam
experiments around the world, and specifically at the Large Hadron Collider at
CERN, more collisions and more complex interactions are expected. This directly
implies an increase in data produced and consequently in the computational
resources needed to process them. At CERN, the amount of data produced is
gargantuan. This is why the data have to be heavily filtered and selected in
real time before being permanently stored. This data can then be used to
perform physics analyses, in order to expand our current understanding of the
universe and improve the Standard Model of physics. This real-time filtering,
known as triggering, involves complex processing happening often at frequencies
as high as 40 MHz. This thesis contributes to understanding how machine
learning models can be efficiently deployed in such environments, in order to
maximize throughput and minimize energy consumption. Inevitably, modern
hardware designed for such tasks and contemporary algorithms are needed in
order to meet the challenges posed by the stringent, high-frequency data rates.
In this work, I present our graph neural network-based pipeline, developed for
charged particle track reconstruction at the LHCb experiment at CERN. The
pipeline was implemented end-to-end inside LHCb's first-level trigger, entirely
on GPUs. Its performance was compared against the classical tracking algorithms
currently in production at LHCb. The pipeline was also accelerated on the FPGA
architecture, and its performance in terms of power consumption and processing
speed was compared against the GPU implementation.

Motivation: 随着6G的出现，移动网络日益异构化和动态化，需要高级自动化管理。意图驱动网络（IDN）通过将高层意图转化为优化策略来解决这一问题，而大型语言模型（LLMs）可以增强这一过程。

Method: 提出了一种分层学习框架，将GenAI集成到IDN的三个关键阶段：意图处理、意图验证和意图执行，并通过基于Mamba架构的案例研究验证其有效性。

Conclusion: 本文为LLM-based IDN架构提供了全面综述，并通过分层框架展示了GenAI在IDN中的潜力，为未来网络自动化管理提供了新方向。

Abstract: With the emergence of 6G, mobile networks are becoming increasingly
heterogeneous and dynamic, necessitating advanced automation for efficient
management. Intent-Driven Networks (IDNs) address this by translating
high-level intents into optimization policies. Large Language Models (LLMs) can
enhance this process by understanding complex human instructions to enable
adaptive, intelligent automation. Given the rapid advancements in Generative AI
(GenAI), a comprehensive survey of LLM-based IDN architectures in disaggregated
Radio Access Network (RAN) environments is both timely and critical. This
article provides such a survey, along with a case study on a hierarchical
learning-enabled IDN architecture that integrates GenAI across three key
stages: intent processing, intent validation, and intent execution. Unlike most
existing approaches that apply GenAI in the form of LLMs for intent processing
only, we propose a hierarchical framework that introduces GenAI across all
three stages of IDN. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed IDN
management architecture, we present a case study based on the latest GenAI
architecture named Mamba. The case study shows how the proposed GenAI-driven
architecture enhances network performance through intelligent automation,
surpassing the performance of the conventional IDN architectures.

Conclusion: 完全去中心化的MARL架构通过共识信息交换和局部奖励共享，有效解决了RA网络中的碰撞和公平性问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: With wireless devices increasingly forming a unified smart network for
seamless, user-friendly operations, random access (RA) medium access control
(MAC) design is considered a key solution for handling unpredictable data
traffic from multiple terminals. However, it remains challenging to design an
effective RA-based MAC protocol to minimize collisions and ensure transmission
fairness across the devices. While existing multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) approaches with centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE)
have been proposed to optimize RA performance, their reliance on centralized
training and the significant overhead required for information collection can
make real-world applications unrealistic. In this work, we adopt a fully
decentralized MARL architecture, where policy learning does not rely on
centralized tasks but leverages consensus-based information exchanges across
devices. We design our MARL algorithm over an actor-critic (AC) network and
propose exchanging only local rewards to minimize communication overhead.
Furthermore, we provide a theoretical proof of global convergence for our
approach. Numerical experiments show that our proposed MARL algorithm can
significantly improve RA network performance compared to other baselines.

Abstract: Participatory Budgeting (PB) empowers citizens to propose and vote on public

often suffer from low participation rates, limiting their visibility and
perceived legitimacy. In this work, we aim to strengthen PB elections in two
key ways: by supporting project proposers in crafting better proposals, and by
helping PB organizers manage large volumes of submissions in a transparent
manner. We propose a privacy-preserving approach to predict which PB proposals
are likely to be funded, using only their textual descriptions and anonymous
historical voting records -- without relying on voter demographics or
personally identifiable information. We evaluate the performance of GPT 4 Turbo
in forecasting proposal outcomes across varying contextual scenarios, observing
that the LLM's prior knowledge needs to be complemented by past voting data to
obtain predictions reflecting real-world PB voting behavior. Our findings
highlight the potential of AI-driven tools to support PB processes by improving

Conclusion: 整合多样方法、战略多样性和跨领域合作是未来AI对齐研究的关键。

Abstract: As AI adoption expands across human society, the problem of aligning AI
models to match human preferences remains a grand challenge. Currently, the AI
alignment field is deeply divided between behavioral and representational
approaches, resulting in narrowly aligned models that are more vulnerable to
increasingly deceptive misalignment threats. In the face of this fragmentation,
we propose an integrated vision for the future of the field. Drawing on related
lessons from immunology and cybersecurity, we lay out a set of design
principles for the development of Integrated Alignment frameworks that combine
the complementary strengths of diverse alignment approaches through deep
integration and adaptive coevolution. We highlight the importance of strategic
diversity - deploying orthogonal alignment and misalignment detection
approaches to avoid homogeneous pipelines that may be "doomed to success". We
also recommend steps for greater unification of the AI alignment research field
itself, through cross-collaboration, open model weights and shared community
resources.

*Sanjana Gautam,Mohit Chandra,Ankolika De,Tatiana Chakravorti,Girik Malik,Munmun De Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文提出一个框架，将生活经验融入AI系统的设计与评估中，强调其对安全性、信任和可用性的影响，并通过跨学科研究提出具体分类和应用建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对生活经验的系统理解，本文旨在填补这一空白，使AI系统更贴近人类认知的情感和情境维度。

Method: 通过综合哲学、人机交互等跨学科文献，提出生活经验的分类框架，并在教育、医疗和文化对齐三个领域进行应用分析。

Result: 提出了一个可操作的框架，帮助设计更具同理心和情境感知的AI系统，并总结了责任分配和长期适应的挑战。

Conclusion: 本文为未来研究奠定了基础，强调技术开发应与受AI系统影响者的生活经验相结合。

Abstract: Lived experiences fundamentally shape how individuals interact with AI
systems, influencing perceptions of safety, trust, and usability. While prior
research has focused on developing techniques to emulate human preferences, and
proposed taxonomies to categorize risks (such as psychological harms and
algorithmic biases), these efforts have provided limited systematic
understanding of lived human experiences or actionable strategies for embedding
them meaningfully into the AI development lifecycle. This work proposes a
framework for meaningfully integrating lived experience into the design and
evaluation of AI systems. We synthesize interdisciplinary literature across
lived experience philosophy, human-centered design, and human-AI interaction,
arguing that centering lived experience can lead to models that more accurately
reflect the retrospective, emotional, and contextual dimensions of human
cognition. Drawing from a wide body of work across psychology, education,
healthcare, and social policy, we present a targeted taxonomy of lived
experiences with specific applicability to AI systems. To ground our framework,
we examine three application domains (i) education, (ii) healthcare, and (iii)
cultural alignment, illustrating how lived experience informs user goals,
system expectations, and ethical considerations in each context. We further
incorporate insights from AI system operators and human-AI partnerships to
highlight challenges in responsibility allocation, mental model calibration,
and long-term system adaptation. We conclude with actionable recommendations
for developing experience-centered AI systems that are not only technically
robust but also empathetic, context-aware, and aligned with human realities.
This work offers a foundation for future research that bridges technical
development with the lived experiences of those impacted by AI systems.

Abstract: This paper considers Ecogame, an innovative art project of 1970, whose
creators believed in a positive vision of a technological future; an
understanding, posited on cybernetics, of a future that could be participatory
via digital means, and therefore more democratised. Using simulation and early
machine learning techniques over a live network, Ecogame combined the power of
visual art with cybernetic concepts of adaptation, feedback, and control to
propose that behaviour had implications for the total system. It provides an
historical precedent for contemporary AI-driven art about using AI in a more
human-centred way.

Motivation: 探讨生成式AI模型在描绘博物馆策展人时是否存在刻板印象和偏见，并对比现实世界的数据。

Method: 基于230张由ChatGPT4o生成的图像进行分析，对比现实中的策展人人口统计数据。

Result: AI图像中女性（3.5%）和少数族裔（0%）被严重低估，年轻人（79%）被高估，且形象偏向时尚广告风格。

Conclusion: 生成式AI的数据集存在偏见，可能导致对博物馆专业人士的错误描绘。

Abstract: Based on 230 visualisations, this paper examines the depiction of museum
curators by the popular generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) model,
ChatGPT4o. While the AI-generated representations do not reiterate popular
stereotypes of curators as nerdy, conservative in dress and stuck in time
rummaging through collections, they contrast sharply with real-world
demographics. AI-generated imagery extremely underrepresents women (3.5% vs 49%
to 72% in reality) and disregards ethnic communities other than Caucasian (0%
vs 18% to 36%). It only over-represents young curators (79% vs approx. 27%) but
also renders curators to resemble yuppie professionals or people featuring in
fashion advertising. Stereotypical attributes are prevalent, with curators
widely depicted as wearing beards and holding clipboards or digital tablets.
The findings highlight biases in the generative AI image creation dataset,
which is poised to shape an inaccurate portrayal of museum professionals if the
images were to be taken uncritically at face value.

Method: 通过六维框架（本体论、认识论、方法论、目的论、价值论和增值论）分类研究取向，分析高引用文献。

Result: 发现研究主要倾向于批判现实主义、实证主义、分析方法、结果导向、认知价值和社会/经济增值；较少采用理想主义、混合方法和文化增值。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于调和学科分歧，促进社会责任感强的研究成果，尤其对早期研究者和跨学科团队有益。

Abstract: Transdisciplinary approaches are increasingly essential for addressing grand
societal challenges, particularly in complex domains such as Artificial
Intelligence (AI), urban planning, and social sciences. However, effectively
validating and integrating knowledge across distinct epistemic and ontological
perspectives poses significant difficulties. This article proposes a
six-dimensional framework for assessing and strengthening transdisciplinary
knowledge validity in AI and city studies, based on an extensive analysis of
the most cited research (2014--2024). Specifically, the framework classifies
research orientations according to ontological, epistemological,
methodological, teleological, axiological, and valorization dimensions. Our
findings show a predominance of perspectives aligned with critical realism
(ontological), positivism (epistemological), analytical methods
(methodological), consequentialism (teleological), epistemic values
(axiological), and social/economic valorization. Less common stances, such as
idealism, mixed methods, and cultural valorization, are also examined for their
potential to enrich knowledge production. We highlight how early career
researchers and transdisciplinary teams can leverage this framework to
reconcile divergent disciplinary viewpoints and promote socially accountable
outcomes.

Motivation: 解决AI预测不确定性在人类决策中的法律和伦理问题，避免加剧社会不平等。

Method: 通过案例研究（AI辅助信贷决策和内容审核）分析选择性弃权和选择性摩擦的潜在歧视影响。

Result: 选择性弃权可能加剧不平等，而选择性摩擦通过透明度和谨慎决策提供更公平的解决方案。

Conclusion: 选择性摩擦是更公平和负责任的AI辅助决策路径，但需注意法律风险。

Abstract: Uncertainty in artificial intelligence (AI) predictions poses urgent legal
and ethical challenges for AI-assisted decision-making. We examine two
algorithmic interventions that act as guardrails for human-AI collaboration:
selective abstention, which withholds high-uncertainty predictions from human
decision-makers, and selective friction, which delivers those predictions
together with salient warnings or disclosures that slow the decision process.
Research has shown that selective abstention based on uncertainty can
inadvertently exacerbate disparities and disadvantage under-represented groups
that disproportionately receive uncertain predictions. In this paper, we
provide the first integrated socio-technical and legal analysis of
uncertainty-based algorithmic interventions. Through two case studies,
AI-assisted consumer credit decisions and AI-assisted content moderation, we
demonstrate how the seemingly neutral use of uncertainty thresholds can trigger
discriminatory impacts. We argue that, although both interventions pose risks
of unlawful discrimination under UK law, selective frictions offer a promising
pathway toward fairer and more accountable AI-assisted decision-making by
preserving transparency and encouraging more cautious human judgment.

Motivation: 现有知识追踪方法在分析历史学习序列与未来表现关系时存在相关性冲突，需要更准确的预测方法。

Method: 提出FINER方法，提取FPTs并结合历史学习序列，采用线性时间检索、相似性感知注意力机制和结合策略。

Result: 在六个真实数据集上，FINER优于十种先进方法，准确率提升8.74%至84.85%。

Conclusion: FINER通过整合FPTs和历史学习序列，显著提升了知识追踪的准确性。

Abstract: Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), such as Massive Open Online Courses,
offer new opportunities for human learning. At the core of such systems,
knowledge tracing (KT) predicts students' future performance by analyzing their
historical learning activities, enabling an accurate evaluation of students'
knowledge states over time. We show that existing KT methods often encounter
correlation conflicts when analyzing the relationships between historical
learning sequences and future performance. To address such conflicts, we
propose to extract so-called Follow-up Performance Trends (FPTs) from
historical ITS data and to incorporate them into KT. We propose a method called
Forward-Looking Knowledge Tracing (FINER) that combines historical learning
sequences with FPTs to enhance student performance prediction accuracy. FINER
constructs learning patterns that facilitate the retrieval of FPTs from
historical ITS data in linear time; FINER includes a novel similarity-aware
attention mechanism that aggregates FPTs based on both frequency and contextual
similarity; and FINER offers means of combining FPTs and historical learning
sequences to enable more accurate prediction of student future performance.
Experiments on six real-world datasets show that FINER can outperform ten
state-of-the-art KT methods, increasing accuracy by 8.74% to 84.85%.

Motivation: 研究AI模型在资源分配等社会决策中的实际应用，尤其是与人类判断和社会公平系统的对齐问题。

Method: 使用真实数据（保持严格保密）分析LLM的判断与人类判断及现有脆弱性评分系统的一致性。

Result: LLM的优先排序在内部、不同LLM之间以及与脆弱性评分系统之间均不一致，但与人类判断在成对测试中表现一致。

Conclusion: 当前AI系统在高风险社会决策中的直接应用尚不成熟。

Abstract: A surge of recent work explores the ethical and societal implications of
large-scale AI models that make "moral" judgments. Much of this literature
focuses either on alignment with human judgments through various thought
experiments or on the group fairness implications of AI judgments. However, the
most immediate and likely use of AI is to help or fully replace the so-called
street-level bureaucrats, the individuals deciding to allocate scarce social
resources or approve benefits. There is a rich history underlying how
principles of local justice determine how society decides on prioritization
mechanisms in such domains. In this paper, we examine how well LLM judgments
align with human judgments, as well as with socially and politically determined
vulnerability scoring systems currently used in the domain of homelessness
resource allocation. Crucially, we use real data on those needing services
(maintaining strict confidentiality by only using local large models) to
perform our analyses. We find that LLM prioritizations are extremely
inconsistent in several ways: internally on different runs, between different
LLMs, and between LLMs and the vulnerability scoring systems. At the same time,
LLMs demonstrate qualitative consistency with lay human judgments in pairwise
testing. Findings call into question the readiness of current generation AI
systems for naive integration in high-stakes societal decision-making.

Motivation: 传统人类驾驶模拟模型过于简化，而现有数据集过于理想化，无法反映真实世界的传感器噪声和复杂性。

Method: 提出了I24-MSD数据集，结合噪声感知损失函数，改进生成模型。

Result: 模型在真实感上优于传统基线，并能有效利用数据中的噪声。

Conclusion: I24-MSD为新一代微观交通模拟提供了基础，更贴近实际需求。

Abstract: Accurately modeling individual vehicle behavior in microscopic traffic
simulation remains a key challenge in intelligent transportation systems, as it
requires vehicles to realistically generate and respond to complex traffic
phenomena such as phantom traffic jams. While traditional human driver
simulation models offer computational tractability, they do so by abstracting
away the very complexity that defines human driving. On the other hand, recent
advances in infrastructure-mounted camera-based roadway sensing have enabled
the extraction of vehicle trajectory data, presenting an opportunity to shift
toward generative, agent-based models. Yet, a major bottleneck remains: most
existing datasets are either overly sanitized or lack standardization, failing
to reflect the noisy, imperfect nature of real-world sensing. Unlike data from
vehicle-mounted sensors-which can mitigate sensing artifacts like occlusion
through overlapping fields of view and sensor fusion-infrastructure-based
sensors surface a messier, more practical view of challenges that traffic
engineers encounter. To this end, we present the I-24 MOTION Scenario Dataset
(I24-MSD)-a standardized, curated dataset designed to preserve a realistic
level of sensor imperfection, embracing these errors as part of the learning
problem rather than an obstacle to overcome purely from preprocessing. Drawing
from noise-aware learning strategies in computer vision, we further adapt
existing generative models in the autonomous driving community for I24-MSD with
noise-aware loss functions. Our results show that such models not only
outperform traditional baselines in realism but also benefit from explicitly
engaging with, rather than suppressing, data imperfection. We view I24-MSD as a
stepping stone toward a new generation of microscopic traffic simulation that
embraces the real-world challenges and is better aligned with practical needs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Omni的地理空间实体解析模型，通过全几何编码器处理多种几何形状，并结合预训练语言模型，显著提升了匹配精度。同时探索了大型语言模型（LLMs）在地理空间实体解析中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理复杂几何形状时存在信息丢失问题，缺乏统一的神经网络嵌入技术。

Method: 提出Omni模型，采用全几何编码器处理点、线、多边形等几何形状，并结合预训练语言模型分析文本属性。

Result: Omni在现有数据集上F1分数提升12%，同时LLMs也表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: Omni模型有效解决了复杂几何形状的嵌入问题，LLMs在地理空间实体解析中具有潜力。

Abstract: The development, integration, and maintenance of geospatial databases rely
heavily on efficient and accurate matching procedures of Geospatial Entity
Resolution (ER). While resolution of points-of-interest (POIs) has been widely
addressed, resolution of entities with diverse geometries has been largely
overlooked. This is partly due to the lack of a uniform technique for embedding
heterogeneous geometries seamlessly into a neural network framework. Existing
neural approaches simplify complex geometries to a single point, resulting in
significant loss of spatial information. To address this limitation, we propose
Omni, a geospatial ER model featuring an omni-geometry encoder. This encoder is
capable of embedding point, line, polyline, polygon, and multi-polygon
geometries, enabling the model to capture the complex geospatial intricacies of
the places being compared. Furthermore, Omni leverages transformer-based
pre-trained language models over individual textual attributes of place records
in an Attribute Affinity mechanism. The model is rigorously tested on existing
point-only datasets and a new diverse-geometry geospatial ER dataset. Omni
produces up to 12% (F1) improvement over existing methods.
  Furthermore, we test the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to conduct
geospatial ER, experimenting with prompting strategies and learning scenarios,
comparing the results of pre-trained language model-based methods with LLMs.
Results indicate that LLMs show competitive results.

Motivation: 研究跨数据库模式的SQL查询映射的可行性和益处，并探索其对文本到SQL系统性能的影响。

Method: 提出SQL-Exchange框架，通过结构对齐和域特定元素调整实现查询映射，并在多种模型和数据集上进行评估。

Result: SQL-Exchange在多种模式和查询类型中表现有效，且映射查询作为上下文示例能显著提升文本到SQL性能。

Conclusion: SQL-Exchange为跨模式查询映射提供了有效解决方案，并证明了其在提升下游任务性能方面的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce SQL-Exchange, a framework for mapping SQL queries across
different database schemas by preserving the source query structure while
adapting domain-specific elements to align with the target schema. We
investigate the conditions under which such mappings are feasible and
beneficial, and examine their impact on enhancing the in-context learning
performance of text-to-SQL systems as a downstream task. Our comprehensive
evaluation across multiple model families and benchmark datasets--assessing
structural alignment with source queries, execution validity on target
databases, and semantic correctness--demonstrates that SQL-Exchange is
effective across a wide range of schemas and query types. Our results further
show that using mapped queries as in-context examples consistently improves
text-to-SQL performance over using queries from the source schema.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音乐数据的时序性和多模态特性使其向量表示易被模型学习或滥用，而传统保护方法（如版权许可和数字水印）对抽象数学表示的保护有限，需要更强的加密手段。

Method: 通过分析音乐信息检索系统的独特威胁模型，提出一种基于AHE的解决方案，利用音乐嵌入的内积实现隐私保护的相似性搜索。

Result: 实证评估表明，该方法在真实MP3文件上的效率和实用性优于FHE方案。

Conclusion: AHE为音乐向量相似性搜索提供了一种高效且实用的隐私保护方案，弥补了传统加密和FHE的不足。

Abstract: In the era of generative AI, ensuring the privacy of music data presents
unique challenges: unlike static artworks such as images, music data is
inherently temporal and multimodal, and it is sampled, transformed, and remixed
at an unprecedented scale. These characteristics make its core vector
embeddings, i.e, the numerical representations of the music, highly susceptible
to being learned, misused, or even stolen by models without accessing the
original audio files. Traditional methods like copyright licensing and digital
watermarking offer limited protection for these abstract mathematical
representations, thus necessitating a stronger, e.g., cryptographic, approach
to safeguarding the embeddings themselves. Standard encryption schemes, such as
AES, render data unintelligible for computation, making such searches
impossible. While Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) provides a plausible
solution by allowing arbitrary computations on ciphertexts, its substantial
performance overhead remains impractical for large-scale vector similarity
searches. Given this trade-off, we propose a more practical approach using
Additive Homomorphic Encryption (AHE) for vector similarity search. The primary
contributions of this paper are threefold: we analyze threat models unique to
music information retrieval systems; we provide a theoretical analysis and
propose an efficient AHE-based solution through inner products of music
embeddings to deliver privacy-preserving similarity search; and finally, we
demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of the proposed approach through
empirical evaluation and comparison to FHE schemes on real-world MP3 files.

Conclusion: 改进的尾界为Beta及相关分布提供了更优的理论工具。

Abstract: This paper presents an improved exponential tail bound for Beta
distributions, refining a result in [15]. This improvement is achieved by
interpreting their bound as a regular Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence one,
while introducing a specific perturbation $\eta$ that shifts the mean of the
Beta distribution closer to zero within the KL bound. Our contribution is to
show that a larger perturbation can be chosen, thereby tightening the bound. We
then extend this result from the Beta distribution to Dirichlet distributions
and Dirichlet processes (DPs).

Conclusion: GBS通过创新的生成模型和奖励对齐系统，显著提升了竞价调整的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Bid shading plays a crucial role in Real-Time Bidding~(RTB) by adaptively
adjusting the bid to avoid advertisers overspending. Existing mainstream
two-stage methods, which first model bid landscapes and then optimize surplus
using operations research techniques, are constrained by unimodal assumptions
that fail to adapt for non-convex surplus curves and are vulnerable to
cascading errors in sequential workflows. Additionally, existing discretization
models of continuous values ignore the dependence between discrete intervals,
reducing the model's error correction ability, while sample selection bias in
bidding scenarios presents further challenges for prediction. To address these
issues, this paper introduces Generative Bid Shading~(GBS), which comprises two
primary components: (1) an end-to-end generative model that utilizes an
autoregressive approach to generate shading ratios by stepwise residuals,
capturing complex value dependencies without relying on predefined priors; and
(2) a reward preference alignment system, which incorporates a channel-aware
hierarchical dynamic network~(CHNet) as the reward model to extract
fine-grained features, along with modules for surplus optimization and
exploration utility reward alignment, ultimately optimizing both short-term and
long-term surplus using group relative policy optimization~(GRPO). Extensive
experiments on both offline and online A/B tests validate GBS's effectiveness.
Moreover, GBS has been deployed on the Meituan DSP platform, serving billions
of bid requests daily.

Conclusion: UPP为路径规划提供了一种同时兼顾安全性和最优性的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We are surrounded by robots helping us perform complex tasks. Robots have a
wide range of applications, from industrial automation to personalized
assistance. However, with great technological innovation come significant
challenges. One of the major challenges in robotics is path planning. Despite
advancements such as graph search, sampling, and potential field methods, most
path planning algorithms focus either on optimality or on safety. Very little
research addresses both simultaneously. We propose a Unified Path Planner (UPP)
that uses modified heuristics and a dynamic safety cost function to balance
safety and optimality. The level of safety can be adjusted via tunable
parameters, trading off against computational complexity. We demonstrate the
planner's performance in simulations, showing how parameter variation affects
results. UPP is compared with various traditional and safe-optimal planning
algorithms across different scenarios. We also validate it on a TurtleBot,
where the robot successfully finds safe and sub-optimal paths.

Conclusion: MetAdv为自动驾驶系统的对抗评估提供了一个可扩展的统一框架，有助于实现更安全的自动驾驶。

Abstract: Evaluating and ensuring the adversarial robustness of autonomous driving (AD)
systems is a critical and unresolved challenge. This paper introduces MetAdv, a
novel adversarial testing platform that enables realistic, dynamic, and
interactive evaluation by tightly integrating virtual simulation with physical
vehicle feedback. At its core, MetAdv establishes a hybrid virtual-physical
sandbox, within which we design a three-layer closed-loop testing environment
with dynamic adversarial test evolution. This architecture facilitates
end-to-end adversarial evaluation, ranging from high-level unified adversarial
generation, through mid-level simulation-based interaction, to low-level
execution on physical vehicles. Additionally, MetAdv supports a broad spectrum
of AD tasks, algorithmic paradigms (e.g., modular deep learning pipelines,
end-to-end learning, vision-language models). It supports flexible 3D vehicle
modeling and seamless transitions between simulated and physical environments,
with built-in compatibility for commercial platforms such as Apollo and Tesla.
A key feature of MetAdv is its human-in-the-loop capability: besides flexible
environmental configuration for more customized evaluation, it enables
real-time capture of physiological signals and behavioral feedback from
drivers, offering new insights into human-machine trust under adversarial
conditions. We believe MetAdv can offer a scalable and unified framework for
adversarial assessment, paving the way for safer AD.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is paramount in their
development and deployment. Safety-critical scenarios pose more severe
challenges, necessitating efficient testing methods to validate AVs safety.
This study focuses on designing an accelerated testing algorithm for AVs in
safety-critical scenarios, enabling swift recognition of their driving
capabilities. First, typical logical scenarios were extracted from real-world
crashes in the China In-depth Mobility Safety Study-Traffic Accident (CIMSS-TA)

Conclusion: 考虑结构信息不确定性的方法能显著提升动态模型的鲁棒性和适应性，适用于复杂机器人场景。

Abstract: Structural causal models describe how the components of a robotic system
interact. They provide both structural and functional information about the
relationships that are present in the system. The structural information
outlines the variables among which there is interaction. The functional
information describes how such interactions work, via equations or learned
models. In this paper we find that learning the functional relationships while
accounting for the uncertainty about the structural information leads to more
robust dynamics models which improves downstream planning, while using
significantly lower computational resources. This in contrast with common
model-learning methods that ignore the causal structure and fail to leverage
the sparsity of interactions in robotic systems. We achieve this by estimating
a causal structure distribution that is used to sample causal graphs that
inform the latent-space representations in an encoder-multidecoder
probabilistic model. We show that our model can be used to learn the dynamics
of a robot, which together with a sampling-based planner can be used to perform
new tasks in novel environments, provided an objective function for the new
requirement is available. We validate our method using manipulators and mobile
robots in both simulation and the real-world. Additionally, we validate the
learned dynamics' adaptability and increased robustness to corrupted inputs and
changes in the environment, which is highly desirable in challenging real-world
robotics scenarios. Video: https://youtu.be/X6k5t7OOnNc.

Conclusion: SI-MPC框架在动态、人多的环境中展现出更安全和适应性更强的导航潜力，强调了系统级评估的重要性。

Abstract: Safe navigation in pedestrian-rich environments remains a key challenge for
autonomous robots. This work evaluates the integration of a deep learning-based
Social-Implicit (SI) pedestrian trajectory predictor within a Model Predictive
Control (MPC) framework on the physical Continental Corriere robot. Tested
across varied pedestrian densities, the SI-MPC system is compared to a
traditional Constant Velocity (CV) model in both open-loop prediction and
closed-loop navigation. Results show that SI improves trajectory prediction -
reducing errors by up to 76% in low-density settings - and enhances safety and
motion smoothness in crowded scenes. Moreover, real-world deployment reveals
discrepancies between open-loop metrics and closed-loop performance, as the SI
model yields broader, more cautious predictions. These findings emphasize the
importance of system-level evaluation and highlight the SI-MPC framework's
promise for safer, more adaptive navigation in dynamic, human-populated
environments.

Result: 相比现有方法，提出的框架在效率、舒适性和安全性上均有提升。

Conclusion: EGT框架能有效优化AVs和MVs的合并决策，平衡多方利益。

Abstract: Highway on-ramp merging is of great challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs),
since they have to proactively interact with surrounding vehicles to enter the
main road safely within limited time. However, existing decision-making
algorithms fail to adequately address dynamic complexities and social
acceptance of AVs, leading to suboptimal or unsafe merging decisions. To
address this, we propose an evolutionary game-theoretic (EGT) merging
decision-making framework, grounded in the bounded rationality of human
drivers, which dynamically balances the benefits of both AVs and main-road
vehicles (MVs). We formulate the cut-in decision-making process as an EGT
problem with a multi-objective payoff function that reflects human-like driving
preferences. By solving the replicator dynamic equation for the evolutionarily
stable strategy (ESS), the optimal cut-in timing is derived, balancing
efficiency, comfort, and safety for both AVs and MVs. A real-time driving style
estimation algorithm is proposed to adjust the game payoff function online by
observing the immediate reactions of MVs. Empirical results demonstrate that we
improve the efficiency, comfort and safety of both AVs and MVs compared with
existing game-theoretic and traditional planning approaches across multi-object
metrics.

Result: AgriVLN在短指令上表现良好，长指令通过STL模块将成功率从0.33提升至0.47。

Conclusion: AgriVLN在农业领域表现优异，为农业机器人导航提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Agricultural robots have emerged as powerful members in agricultural tasks,
nevertheless, still heavily rely on manual operation or untransportable railway
for movement, resulting in limited mobility and poor adaptability.
Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) enables robots to navigate to the target
destinations following natural language instructions, demonstrating strong
performance on several domains. However, none of the existing benchmarks or
methods is specifically designed for agricultural scenes. To bridge this gap,
we propose Agriculture to Agriculture (A2A) benchmark, containing 1,560
episodes across six diverse agricultural scenes, in which all realistic RGB
videos are captured by front-facing camera on a quadruped robot at a height of
0.38 meters, aligning with the practical deployment conditions. Meanwhile, we
propose Vision-and-Language Navigation for Agricultural Robots (AgriVLN)
baseline based on Vision-Language Model (VLM) prompted with carefully crafted
templates, which can understand both given instructions and agricultural
environments to generate appropriate low-level actions for robot control. When
evaluated on A2A, AgriVLN performs well on short instructions but struggles
with long instructions, because it often fails to track which part of the
instruction is currently being executed. To address this, we further propose
Subtask List (STL) instruction decomposition module and integrate it into
AgriVLN, improving Success Rate (SR) from 0.33 to 0.47. We additionally compare
AgriVLN with several existing VLN methods, demonstrating the state-of-the-art
performance in the agricultural domain.

Abstract: For transradial amputees, robotic prosthetic hands promise to regain the
capability to perform daily living activities. To advance next-generation
prosthetic hand control design, it is crucial to address current shortcomings
in robustness to out of lab artifacts, and generalizability to new
environments. Due to the fixed number of object to interact with in existing
datasets, contrasted with the virtually infinite variety of objects encountered
in the real world, current grasp models perform poorly on unseen objects,
negatively affecting users' independence and quality of life.
  To address this: (i) we define semantic projection, the ability of a model to
generalize to unseen object types and show that conventional models like YOLO,
despite 80% training accuracy, drop to 15% on unseen objects. (ii) we propose
Grasp-LLaVA, a Grasp Vision Language Model enabling human-like reasoning to
infer the suitable grasp type estimate based on the object's physical
characteristics resulting in a significant 50.2% accuracy over unseen object
types compared to 36.7% accuracy of an SOTA grasp estimation model.
  Lastly, to bridge the performance-latency gap, we propose Hybrid Grasp
Network (HGN), an edge-cloud deployment infrastructure enabling fast grasp
estimation on edge and accurate cloud inference as a fail-safe, effectively
expanding the latency vs. accuracy Pareto. HGN with confidence calibration (DC)
enables dynamic switching between edge and cloud models, improving semantic
projection accuracy by 5.6% (to 42.3%) with 3.5x speedup over the unseen object
types. Over a real-world sample mix, it reaches 86% average accuracy (12.2%
gain over edge-only), and 2.2x faster inference than Grasp-LLaVA alone.

Abstract: Precise needle alignment is essential for percutaneous needle insertion in
robotic ultrasound-guided procedures. However, inherent challenges such as
speckle noise, needle-like artifacts, and low image resolution make robust
needle detection difficult, particularly when visibility is reduced or lost. In
this paper, we propose a method to restore needle alignment when the ultrasound
imaging plane and the needle insertion plane are misaligned. Unlike many
existing approaches that rely heavily on needle visibility in ultrasound
images, our method uses a more robust feature by periodically vibrating the
needle using a mechanical system. Specifically, we propose a vibration-based
energy metric that remains effective even when the needle is fully out of
plane. Using this metric, we develop a control strategy to reposition the
ultrasound probe in response to misalignments between the imaging plane and the
needle insertion plane in both translation and rotation. Experiments conducted
on ex-vivo porcine tissue samples using a dual-arm robotic ultrasound-guided
needle insertion system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The experimental results show the translational error of 0.41$\pm$0.27 mm and
the rotational error of 0.51$\pm$0.19 degrees.

Abstract: Long-Horizon (LH) tasks in Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) are complex
multi-step tasks that require continuous planning, sequential decision-making,
and extended execution across domains to achieve the final goal. However,
existing methods heavily rely on skill chaining by concatenating pre-trained
subtasks, with environment observations and self-state tightly coupled, lacking
the ability to generalize to new combinations of environments and skills,
failing to complete various LH tasks across domains. To solve this problem,
this paper presents DETACH, a cross-domain learning framework for LH tasks via
biologically inspired dual-stream disentanglement. Inspired by the brain's
"where-what" dual pathway mechanism, DETACH comprises two core modules: i) an
environment learning module for spatial understanding, which captures object
functions, spatial relationships, and scene semantics, achieving cross-domain
transfer through complete environment-self disentanglement; ii) a skill
learning module for task execution, which processes self-state information
including joint degrees of freedom and motor patterns, enabling cross-skill
transfer through independent motor pattern encoding. We conducted extensive
experiments on various LH tasks in HSI scenes. Compared with existing methods,
DETACH can achieve an average subtasks success rate improvement of 23% and
average execution efficiency improvement of 29%.

Abstract: Language-guided long-horizon mobile manipulation has long been a grand
challenge in embodied semantic reasoning, generalizable manipulation, and
adaptive locomotion. Three fundamental limitations hinder progress: First,
although large language models have improved spatial reasoning and task
planning through semantic priors, existing implementations remain confined to
tabletop scenarios, failing to address the constrained perception and limited
actuation ranges of mobile platforms. Second, current manipulation strategies
exhibit insufficient generalization when confronted with the diverse object
configurations encountered in open-world environments. Third, while crucial for
practical deployment, the dual requirement of maintaining high platform
maneuverability alongside precise end-effector control in unstructured settings
remains understudied.
  In this work, we present ODYSSEY, a unified mobile manipulation framework for
agile quadruped robots equipped with manipulators, which seamlessly integrates
high-level task planning with low-level whole-body control. To address the
challenge of egocentric perception in language-conditioned tasks, we introduce
a hierarchical planner powered by a vision-language model, enabling
long-horizon instruction decomposition and precise action execution. At the
control level, our novel whole-body policy achieves robust coordination across
challenging terrains. We further present the first benchmark for long-horizon
mobile manipulation, evaluating diverse indoor and outdoor scenarios. Through
successful sim-to-real transfer, we demonstrate the system's generalization and
robustness in real-world deployments, underscoring the practicality of legged
manipulators in unstructured environments. Our work advances the feasibility of
generalized robotic assistants capable of complex, dynamic tasks. Our project

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于组件感知结构化剪枝的模型压缩方法，用于在资源受限设备上部署神经网络控制器，同时保持稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 资源受限设备（如移动机器人、可穿戴设备等）对高效神经网络控制器的需求增加，但传统深度神经网络的计算复杂性和内存需求限制了其实际部署。

Method: 采用组件感知结构化剪枝方法，结合数学稳定性保证（如Lyapunov准则），确定最优剪枝幅度，平衡压缩与稳定性。

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法在降低模型复杂度的同时保持了控制性能和稳定性，并确定了安全压缩比的理论界限。

Conclusion: 为资源受限环境中的压缩神经网络控制器部署提供了理论框架和实践指导。

Abstract: The rapid growth of resource-constrained mobile platforms, including mobile
robots, wearable systems, and Internet-of-Things devices, has increased the
demand for computationally efficient neural network controllers (NNCs) that can
operate within strict hardware limitations. While deep neural networks (DNNs)
demonstrate superior performance in control applications, their substantial
computational complexity and memory requirements present significant barriers
to practical deployment on edge devices. This paper introduces a comprehensive
model compression methodology that leverages component-aware structured pruning
to determine the optimal pruning magnitude for each pruning group, ensuring a
balance between compression and stability for NNC deployment. Our approach is
rigorously evaluated on Temporal Difference Model Predictive Control (TD-MPC),
a state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, with a
systematic integration of mathematical stability guarantee properties,
specifically Lyapunov criteria. The key contribution of this work lies in
providing a principled framework for determining the theoretical limits of
model compression while preserving controller stability. Experimental
validation demonstrates that our methodology successfully reduces model
complexity while maintaining requisite control performance and stability
characteristics. Furthermore, our approach establishes a quantitative boundary
for safe compression ratios, enabling practitioners to systematically determine
the maximum permissible model reduction before violating critical stability
properties, thereby facilitating the confident deployment of compressed NNCs in
resource-limited environments.

### [684] [Reconstruction of Solar EUV Irradiance Using CaII K Images and SOHO/SEM Data with Bayesian Deep Learning and Uncertainty Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07065)
*Haodi Jiang,Qin Li,Jason T. L. Wang,Haimin Wang,Serena Criscuoli*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SEMNet的贝叶斯深度学习模型，用于填补太阳极紫外（EUV）辐射长期数据的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 太阳EUV辐射对地球大气层有重要影响，但长期EUV数据缺失，尤其是1995年之前的记录。

Method: 使用贝叶斯深度学习模型SEMNet，基于CaII K图像重建EUV辐射数据，并通过迁移学习扩展应用。

Result: SEMNet成功重建了1998-2014年和1950-1960年的EUV辐射数据，并提供了可靠的预测和不确定性范围。

Conclusion: CaII K图像可作为长期EUV辐射的可靠替代数据，有助于理解太阳对地球气候的长期影响。

Abstract: Solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) irradiance plays a crucial role in heating
the Earth's ionosphere, thermosphere, and mesosphere, affecting atmospheric
dynamics over varying time scales. Although significant effort has been spent
studying short-term EUV variations from solar transient events, there is little
work to explore the long-term evolution of the EUV flux over multiple solar
cycles. Continuous EUV flux measurements have only been available since 1995,
leaving significant gaps in earlier data. In this study, we propose a Bayesian
deep learning model, named SEMNet, to fill the gaps. We validate our approach
by applying SEMNet to construct SOHO/SEM EUV flux measurements in the period
between 1998 and 2014 using CaII K images from the Precision Solar Photometric
Telescope. We then extend SEMNet through transfer learning to reconstruct solar
EUV irradiance in the period between 1950 and 1960 using CaII K images from the
Kodaikanal Solar Observatory. Experimental results show that SEMNet provides
reliable predictions along with uncertainty bounds, demonstrating the
feasibility of CaII K images as a robust proxy for long-term EUV fluxes. These
findings contribute to a better understanding of solar influences on Earth's
climate over extended periods.

TL;DR: 本文综述了自驱动实验室（SDLs）在加速材料发现中的作用，通过量化实验减少量来评估其效果，并提出了两个关键指标AF和EF。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加速材料发现是现代材料科学的关键目标，SDLs通过机器学习和自动化实现更高效、智能的实验。

Method: 综述了AF和EF的理论基础，并通过文献回顾和模拟贝叶斯优化分析了SDLs的效果。

Result: 文献显示AF中位数为6，且随维度增加；EF值变化大，但峰值在10-20次实验/维度。模拟揭示了EF与参数空间统计特性、AF与复杂度的关系。

Conclusion: SDL在多种材料参数空间中具有显著加速效果，研究结果为其应用提供了量化依据和共同语言。

Abstract: A key goal of modern materials science is accelerating the pace of materials
discovery. Self-driving labs, or systems that select experiments using machine
learning and then execute them using automation, are designed to fulfil this
promise by performing experiments faster, more intelligently, more reliably,
and with richer metadata than conventional means. This review summarizes
progress in understanding the degree to which SDLs accelerate learning by
quantifying how much they reduce the number of experiments required for a given
goal. The review begins by summarizing the theory underlying two key metrics,
namely acceleration factor AF and enhancement factor EF, which quantify how
much faster and better an algorithm is relative to a reference strategy. Next,
we provide a comprehensive review of the literature, which reveals a wide range
of AFs with a median of 6, and that tends to increase with the dimensionality
of the space, reflecting an interesting blessing of dimensionality. In
contrast, reported EF values vary by over two orders of magnitude, although
they consistently peak at 10-20 experiments per dimension. To understand these
results, we perform a series of simulated Bayesian optimization campaigns that
reveal how EF depends upon the statistical properties of the parameter space
while AF depends on its complexity. Collectively, these results reinforce the
motivation for using SDLs by revealing their value across a wide range of
material parameter spaces and provide a common language for quantifying and
understanding this acceleration.

### [686] [Forecasting Commodity Price Shocks Using Temporal and Semantic Fusion of Prices Signals and Agentic Generative AI Extracted Economic News](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06497)
*Mohammed-Khalil Ghali,Cecil Pang,Oscar Molina,Carlos Gershenson-Garcia,Daehan Won*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合历史商品价格数据和全球经济新闻语义信号的混合预测框架，通过生成式AI管道提升商品价格飙升的预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商品价格飙升的准确预测对经济缓冲有限的国家至关重要，因其可能影响国家预算、依赖进口的行业以及食品和能源安全。

Method: 采用双流LSTM网络与注意力机制结合的方法，融合结构化时间序列数据和语义嵌入的新闻摘要（1960-2023年）。

Result: 模型在64年数据集上表现优异，平均AUC为0.94，准确率为0.91，显著优于传统方法。去除新闻组件会导致性能大幅下降。

Conclusion: 结合生成式AI与深度学习能有效提升商品价格冲击的早期检测，为经济规划和风险缓解提供实用工具。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of commodity price spikes is vital for countries with
limited economic buffers, where sudden increases can strain national budgets,
disrupt import-reliant sectors, and undermine food and energy security. This
paper introduces a hybrid forecasting framework that combines historical
commodity price data with semantic signals derived from global economic news,
using an agentic generative AI pipeline. The architecture integrates
dual-stream Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with attention mechanisms to
fuse structured time-series inputs with semantically embedded, fact-checked
news summaries collected from 1960 to 2023. The model is evaluated on a 64-year
dataset comprising normalized commodity price series and temporally aligned
news embeddings. Results show that the proposed approach achieves a mean AUC of
0.94 and an overall accuracy of 0.91 substantially outperforming traditional
baselines such as logistic regression (AUC = 0.34), random forest (AUC = 0.57),
and support vector machines (AUC = 0.47). Additional ablation studies reveal
that the removal of attention or dimensionality reduction leads to moderate
declines in performance, while eliminating the news component causes a steep
drop in AUC to 0.46, underscoring the critical value of incorporating
real-world context through unstructured text. These findings demonstrate that
integrating agentic generative AI with deep learning can meaningfully improve
early detection of commodity price shocks, offering a practical tool for
economic planning and risk mitigation in volatile market environments while
saving the very high costs of operating a full generative AI agents pipeline.

### [687] [Can Smaller Large Language Models Evaluate Research Quality?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07196)
*Mike Thelwall*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: 研究发现，较小的离线LLM（如Gemma-3-27b-it）也能有效评估研究质量，其评分与专家评分正相关，但效果略逊于大型LLM（如ChatGPT 4o）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨较小LLM是否具备与大型LLM类似的研究质量评估能力，以验证这一能力是否为大型LLM的独有特性。

Method: 使用Gemma-3-27b-it对104,187篇文章进行评估，并与ChatGPT 4o和4o-mini的结果进行比较。

Result: Gemma-3-27b-it的评分与专家评分正相关，但相关性强度为ChatGPT 4o的83.8%和4o-mini的94.7%。评分重复平均对其效果提升不明显。

Conclusion: 小型LLM可用于研究质量评估，适合成本敏感或需离线处理的场景，但大型LLM仍表现最佳。

Abstract: Although both Google Gemini (1.5 Flash) and ChatGPT (4o and 4o-mini) give
research quality evaluation scores that correlate positively with expert scores
in nearly all fields, and more strongly that citations in most, it is not known
whether this is true for smaller Large Language Models (LLMs). In response,
this article assesses Google's Gemma-3-27b-it, a downloadable LLM (60Gb). The
results for 104,187 articles show that Gemma-3-27b-it scores correlate
positively with an expert research quality score proxy for all 34 Units of
Assessment (broad fields) from the UK Research Excellence Framework 2021. The
Gemma-3-27b-it correlations have 83.8% of the strength of ChatGPT 4o and 94.7%
of the strength of ChatGPT 4o-mini correlations. Differently from the two
larger LLMs, the Gemma-3-27b-it correlations do not increase substantially when
the scores are averaged across five repetitions, its scores tend to be lower,
and its reports are relatively uniform in style. Overall, the results show that
research quality score estimation can be conducted by offline LLMs, so this
capability is not an emergent property of the largest LLMs. Moreover, score
improvement through repetition is not a universal feature of LLMs. In
conclusion, although the largest LLMs still have the highest research
evaluation score estimation capability, smaller ones can also be used for this
task, and this can be helpful for cost saving or when secure offline processing
is needed.

*Jianting Tang,Yubo Wang,Haoyu Cao,Linli Xu*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: CROP提出了一种通过多视图整合增强LLMs分子理解的方法，结合拓扑和空间结构视图，提升分子任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子序列无法完全捕捉复杂结构，需结合拓扑和空间视图以更全面理解分子。

Method: CROP通过固定长度前缀联合重采样多视图，利用SMILES Guided Resampler和Structural Embedding Gate生成前缀。

Result: 实验表明CROP在分子描述、IUPAC名称预测和分子性质预测任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: CROP高效且有效地整合多视图，显著提升LLMs在分子科学中的应用能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in molecular science have been propelled significantly by
large language models (LLMs). However, their effectiveness is limited when
relying solely on molecular sequences, which fail to capture the complex
structures of molecules. Beyond sequence representation, molecules exhibit two
complementary structural views: the first focuses on the topological
relationships between atoms, as exemplified by the graph view; and the second
emphasizes the spatial configuration of molecules, as represented by the image
view. The two types of views provide unique insights into molecular structures.
To leverage these views collaboratively, we propose the CROss-view Prefixes
(CROP) to enhance LLMs' molecular understanding through efficient multi-view
integration. CROP possesses two advantages: (i) efficiency: by jointly
resampling multiple structural views into fixed-length prefixes, it avoids
excessive consumption of the LLM's limited context length and allows easy
expansion to more views; (ii) effectiveness: by utilizing the LLM's
self-encoded molecular sequences to guide the resampling process, it boosts the
quality of the generated prefixes. Specifically, our framework features a
carefully designed SMILES Guided Resampler for view resampling, and a
Structural Embedding Gate for converting the resulting embeddings into LLM's
prefixes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of CROP in tasks
including molecule captioning, IUPAC name prediction and molecule property
prediction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的ASR上下文偏置框架，支持CTC、Transducers和Attention Encoder-Decoder模型，基于GPU加速的单词提升树，在解码速度和准确性上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文偏置方法需要额外训练、解码速度慢或限制ASR系统类型，亟需一种通用且高效的解决方案。

Method: 基于GPU加速的单词提升树，支持浅融合模式，适用于贪婪和束搜索解码，支持多达20K个关键短语。

Result: 在准确性和解码速度上优于开源上下文偏置方法，无明显速度下降。

Conclusion: 该框架高效通用，已开源为NeMo工具包的一部分。

Abstract: Recognizing specific key phrases is an essential task for contextualized
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, most existing context-biasing
approaches have limitations associated with the necessity of additional model
training, significantly slow down the decoding process, or constrain the choice
of the ASR system type. This paper proposes a universal ASR context-biasing
framework that supports all major types: CTC, Transducers, and Attention
Encoder-Decoder models. The framework is based on a GPU-accelerated word
boosting tree, which enables it to be used in shallow fusion mode for greedy
and beam search decoding without noticeable speed degradation, even with a vast
number of key phrases (up to 20K items). The obtained results showed high
efficiency of the proposed method, surpassing the considered open-source
context-biasing approaches in accuracy and decoding speed. Our context-biasing
framework is open-sourced as a part of the NeMo toolkit.

Motivation: 传统波束搜索实现慢且CPU受限，无法充分利用现代硬件能力。

Method: 开发了完全基于GPU的FlexCTC工具包，使用Python和PyTorch，支持高性能批处理、消除CPU-GPU同步，并利用CUDA Graphs减少内核启动开销。

Result: 实现了高效准确的解码，支持N-gram语言模型融合和短语级提升。

Conclusion: FlexCTC为CTC模型提供了快速、可扩展的解码解决方案，适用于研究和生产环境。

Abstract: While beam search improves speech recognition quality over greedy decoding,
standard implementations are slow, often sequential, and CPU-bound. To fully
leverage modern hardware capabilities, we present a novel open-source FlexCTC
toolkit for fully GPU-based beam decoding, designed for Connectionist Temporal
Classification (CTC) models. Developed entirely in Python and PyTorch, it
offers a fast, user-friendly, and extensible alternative to traditional C++,
CUDA, or WFST-based decoders. The toolkit features a high-performance, fully
batched GPU implementation with eliminated CPU-GPU synchronization and
minimized kernel launch overhead via CUDA Graphs. It also supports advanced
contextualization techniques, including GPU-powered N-gram language model
fusion and phrase-level boosting. These features enable accurate and efficient
decoding, making them suitable for both research and production use.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为G-IFT的创新框架，通过门控线性单元适配器和迭代微调，提升成人语音与儿童语音之间的知识迁移效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 成人语音训练的说话人验证系统在儿童语音上表现不佳，且儿童语音数据有限，微调效果不显著。

Method: 在预训练的说话人嵌入模型和分类器之间插入门控线性单元适配器，并采用迭代方式依次优化分类器、适配器和预训练模型。

Result: 在ECAPA-TDNN、ResNet和X-vector架构上，G-IFT框架显著降低了等错误率。

Conclusion: G-IFT框架在多种架构中均表现优异，有效解决了儿童语音数据稀缺的问题。

Abstract: Speaker Verification (SV) systems trained on adults speech often underperform
on children's SV due to the acoustic mismatch, and limited children speech data
makes fine-tuning not very effective. In this paper, we propose an innovative
framework, a Gated Linear Unit adapter with Iterative Fine-Tuning (G-IFT), to
enhance knowledge transfer efficiency between the high-resource adults speech
domain and the low-resource children's speech domain. In this framework, a
Gated Linear Unit adapter is first inserted between the pre-trained speaker
embedding model and the classifier. Then the classifier, adapter, and
pre-trained speaker embedding model are optimized sequentially in an iterative
way. This framework is agnostic to the type of the underlying architecture of
the SV system. Our experiments on ECAPA-TDNN, ResNet, and X-vector
architectures using the OGI and MyST datasets demonstrate that the G-IFT
framework yields consistent reductions in Equal Error Rates compared to
baseline methods.

Motivation: 随着音频驱动的人脸生成器和TTS模型的快速发展，深度伪造技术日益复杂，需要更鲁棒的检测方法，尤其是针对未见过的攻击场景。

Method: 视觉模态采用手工特征以提高可解释性和适应性；音频模态结合自监督学习骨干和图形注意力网络，以捕捉丰富的音频表示。

Result: 在AV-Deepfake1M++数据集上，多模态系统在深度伪造分类任务中AUC达92.78%，仅音频模态的时序定位IoU为0.3536。

Conclusion: 该方法在性能和实际部署之间取得平衡，具有鲁棒性和潜在的可解释性。

Abstract: The rapid development of audio-driven talking head generators and advanced
Text-To-Speech (TTS) models has led to more sophisticated temporal deepfakes.
These advances highlight the need for robust methods capable of detecting and
localizing deepfakes, even under novel, unseen attack scenarios. Current
state-of-the-art deepfake detectors, while accurate, are often computationally
expensive and struggle to generalize to novel manipulation techniques. To
address these challenges, we propose multimodal approaches for the
AV-Deepfake1M 2025 challenge. For the visual modality, we leverage handcrafted
features to improve interpretability and adaptability. For the audio modality,
we adapt a self-supervised learning (SSL) backbone coupled with graph attention
networks to capture rich audio representations, improving detection robustness.
Our approach strikes a balance between performance and real-world deployment,
focusing on resilience and potential interpretability. On the AV-Deepfake1M++
dataset, our multimodal system achieves AUC of 92.78% for deepfake
classification task and IoU of 0.3536 for temporal localization using only the
audio modality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前听觉智能系统仅能完成表面层次的识别任务（如声音事件检测、场景分类等），缺乏对声音背后原因、含义和上下文的理解。

Method: 提出了四个认知启发的任务范式：ASPIRE（时间-频率模式描述）、SODA（分层事件/场景描述）、AUX（因果解释）、AUGMENT（目标驱动解释）。

Result: 这些范式为更通用、可解释且与人类对齐的听觉智能提供了路线图。

Conclusion: 论文旨在推动机器对声音理解的更广泛讨论，并提出了未来听觉智能的发展方向。

Abstract: Recent progress in auditory intelligence has yielded high-performing systems
for sound event detection (SED), acoustic scene classification (ASC), automated
audio captioning (AAC), and audio question answering (AQA). Yet these tasks
remain largely constrained to surface-level recognition-capturing what happened
but not why, what it implies, or how it unfolds in context. I propose a
conceptual reframing of auditory intelligence as a layered, situated process
that encompasses perception, reasoning, and interaction. To instantiate this
view, I introduce four cognitively inspired task paradigms-ASPIRE, SODA, AUX,
and AUGMENT-those structure auditory understanding across time-frequency
pattern captioning, hierarchical event/scene description, causal explanation,
and goal-driven interpretation, respectively. Together, these paradigms provide
a roadmap toward more generalizable, explainable, and human-aligned auditory
intelligence, and are intended to catalyze a broader discussion of what it
means for machines to understand sound.

Result: 理论证明了模型估计、变量选择和子组结构恢复的一致性，仿真和实际数据应用显示优越的预测性能。

Conclusion: FOL方法在流数据和高维场景下具有高效性和实用性，为实际应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Federated learning has emerged as an essential paradigm for distributed
multi-source data analysis under privacy concerns. Most existing federated
learning methods focus on the ``static" datasets. However, in many real-world
applications, data arrive continuously over time, forming streaming datasets.
This introduces additional challenges for data storage and algorithm design,
particularly under high-dimensional settings. In this paper, we propose a
federated online learning (FOL) method for distributed multi-source streaming
data analysis. To account for heterogeneity, a personalized model is
constructed for each data source, and a novel ``subgroup" assumption is
employed to capture potential similarities, thereby enhancing model
performance. We adopt the penalized renewable estimation method and the
efficient proximal gradient descent for model training. The proposed method
aligns with both federated and online learning frameworks: raw data are not
exchanged among sources, ensuring data privacy, and only summary statistics of
previous data batches are required for model updates, significantly reducing
storage demands. Theoretically, we establish the consistency properties for
model estimation, variable selection, and subgroup structure recovery,
demonstrating optimal statistical efficiency. Simulations illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, when applied to the
financial lending data and the web log data, the proposed method also exhibits
advantageous prediction performance. Results of the analysis also provide some
practical insights.

Conclusion: MOCA-HESP为组合和混合变量的高维优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: High-dimensional Bayesian Optimization (BO) has attracted significant
attention in recent research. However, existing methods have mainly focused on
optimizing in continuous domains, while combinatorial (ordinal and categorical)
and mixed domains still remain challenging. In this paper, we first propose
MOCA-HESP, a novel high-dimensional BO method for combinatorial and mixed
variables. The key idea is to leverage the hyper-ellipsoid space partitioning
(HESP) technique with different categorical encoders to work with
high-dimensional, combinatorial and mixed spaces, while adaptively selecting
the optimal encoders for HESP using a multi-armed bandit technique. Our method,
MOCA-HESP, is designed as a \textit{meta-algorithm} such that it can
incorporate other combinatorial and mixed BO optimizers to further enhance the
optimizers' performance. Finally, we develop three practical BO methods by
integrating MOCA-HESP with state-of-the-art BO optimizers for combinatorial and
mixed variables: standard BO, CASMOPOLITAN, and Bounce. Our experimental
results on various synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that our methods
outperform existing baselines. Our code implementation can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异常检测在目标域数据有限时性能下降，而域适应可能引入不确定性，导致统计结论不可靠。

Method: 提出STAND-DA框架，结合SI计算有效p值，并通过GPU加速实现高效计算。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了方法的理论有效性和计算效率。

Conclusion: STAND-DA为异常检测提供了统计严格且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a vital role across a wide range of domains, but
its performance might deteriorate when applied to target domains with limited
data. Domain Adaptation (DA) offers a solution by transferring knowledge from a
related source domain with abundant data. However, this adaptation process can
introduce additional uncertainty, making it difficult to draw statistically
valid conclusions from AD results. In this paper, we propose STAND-DA -- a
novel framework for statistically rigorous Autoencoder-based AD after
Representation Learning-based DA. Built on the Selective Inference (SI)
framework, STAND-DA computes valid $p$-values for detected anomalies and
rigorously controls the false positive rate below a pre-specified level
$\alpha$ (e.g., 0.05). To address the computational challenges of applying SI
to deep learning models, we develop the GPU-accelerated SI implementation,
significantly enhancing both scalability and runtime performance. This
advancement makes SI practically feasible for modern, large-scale deep
architectures. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
validate the theoretical results and computational efficiency of the proposed
STAND-DA method.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to
membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to infer whether a data record
was used to train a target model or not. To analyze and study these
vulnerabilities, various MIA methods have been proposed. Despite the
significance and popularity of MIAs, existing works on MIAs are limited in
providing guarantees on the false discovery rate (FDR), which refers to the
expected proportion of false discoveries among the identified positive
discoveries. However, it is very challenging to ensure the false discovery rate
guarantees, because the underlying distribution is usually unknown, and the
estimated non-member probabilities often exhibit interdependence. To tackle the
above challenges, in this paper, we design a novel membership inference attack
method, which can provide the guarantees on the false discovery rate.
Additionally, we show that our method can also provide the marginal probability
guarantee on labeling true non-member data as member data. Notably, our method
can work as a wrapper that can be seamlessly integrated with existing MIA
methods in a post-hoc manner, while also providing the FDR control. We perform
the theoretical analysis for our method. Extensive experiments in various
settings (e.g., the black-box setting and the lifelong learning setting) are
also conducted to verify the desirable performance of our method.

Abstract: This work advances the theoretical foundations of reservoir computing (RC) by
providing a unified treatment of fading memory and the echo state property
(ESP) in both deterministic and stochastic settings. We investigate state-space
systems, a central model class in time series learning, and establish that
fading memory and solution stability hold generically -- even in the absence of
the ESP -- offering a robust explanation for the empirical success of RC models
without strict contractivity conditions. In the stochastic case, we critically
assess stochastic echo states, proposing a novel distributional perspective
rooted in attractor dynamics on the space of probability distributions, which
leads to a rich and coherent theory. Our results extend and generalize previous
work on non-autonomous dynamical systems, offering new insights into causality,
stability, and memory in RC models. This lays the groundwork for reliable
generative modeling of temporal data in both deterministic and stochastic
regimes.

Abstract: Off-policy estimation (OPE) methods enable unbiased offline evaluation of
recommender systems, directly estimating the online reward some target policy
would have obtained, from offline data and with statistical guarantees. The
theoretical elegance of the framework combined with practical successes have
led to a surge of interest, with many competing estimators now available to
practitioners and researchers. Among these, Doubly Robust methods provide a
prominent strategy to combine value- and policy-based estimators.
  In this work, we take an alternative perspective to combine a set of OPE
estimators and their associated confidence intervals into a single, more
accurate estimate. Our approach leverages a correlated fixed-effects
meta-analysis framework, explicitly accounting for dependencies among
estimators that arise due to shared data. This yields a best linear unbiased
estimate (BLUE) of the target policy's value, along with an appropriately
conservative confidence interval that reflects inter-estimator correlation. We
validate our method on both simulated and real-world data, demonstrating
improved statistical efficiency over existing individual estimators.

Abstract: In this paper, we establish non-asymptotic bounds for accuracy of normal
approximation for linear two-timescale stochastic approximation (TTSA)
algorithms driven by martingale difference or Markov noise. Focusing on both
the last iterate and Polyak-Ruppert averaging regimes, we derive bounds for
normal approximation in terms of the convex distance between probability
distributions. Our analysis reveals a non-trivial interaction between the fast
and slow timescales: the normal approximation rate for the last iterate
improves as the timescale separation increases, while it decreases in the
Polyak-Ruppert averaged setting. We also provide the high-order moment bounds
for the error of linear TTSA algorithm, which may be of independent interest.

Abstract: We propose a novel kernel-based nonparametric two-sample test, employing the
combined use of kernel mean and kernel covariance embedding. Our test builds on
recent results showing how such combined embeddings map distinct probability
measures to mutually singular Gaussian measures on the kernel's RKHS.
Leveraging this result, we construct a test statistic based on the relative
entropy between the Gaussian embeddings, i.e.\ the likelihood ratio. The
likelihood ratio is specifically tailored to detect equality versus singularity
of two Gaussians, and satisfies a ``$0/\infty$" law, in that it vanishes under
the null and diverges under the alternative. To implement the test in finite
samples, we introduce a regularised version, calibrated by way of permutation.
We prove consistency, establish uniform power guarantees under mild conditions,
and discuss how our framework unifies and extends prior approaches based on
spectrally regularized MMD. Empirical results on synthetic and real data
demonstrate remarkable gains in power compared to state-of-the-art methods,
particularly in high-dimensional and weak-signal regimes.
