To bridge the gap, we introduce\nSentient Agent as a Judge (SAGE), an automated evaluation framework that\nmeasures an LLM's higher-order social cognition. SAGE instantiates a Sentient\nAgent that simulates human-like emotional changes and inner thoughts during\ninteraction, providing a more realistic evaluation of the tested model in\nmulti-turn conversations. At every turn, the agent reasons about (i) how its\nemotion changes, (ii) how it feels, and (iii) how it should reply, yielding a\nnumerical emotion trajectory and interpretable inner thoughts. Experiments on\n100 supportive-dialogue scenarios show that the final Sentient emotion score\ncorrelates strongly with Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory (BLRI) ratings\nand utterance-level empathy metrics, validating psychological fidelity. We also\nbuild a public Sentient Leaderboard covering 18 commercial and open-source\nmodels that uncovers substantial gaps (up to 4x) between frontier systems\n(GPT-4o-Latest, Gemini2.5-Pro) and earlier baselines, gaps not reflected in\nconventional leaderboards (e.g., Arena).

Evaluation results show that\nour approach can improve win rate of LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct from 19.5 to 48.3 on\nArena-Hard and from 22.33 to 57.23 on AlpacaEval2, highlighting a promising\ndirection for model alignment through this new scalable and diverse synthetic\ndata recipe. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MoAA enables a self-improvement\npipeline, where models finetuned on MoA-generated data surpass their own\ninitial capabilities, providing evidence that our approach can push the\nfrontier of open-source LLMs without reliance on stronger external supervision.\nData and code will be released."}

A hurdle for event-based VFI is how to effectively deal\nwith non-linear motion, caused by the dynamic changes in motion direction and\nspeed within the scene. Existing methods either use events to estimate sparse\noptical flow or fuse events with image features to estimate dense optical flow.\nUnfortunately, motion errors often degrade the VFI quality as the continuous\nmotion cues from events do not align with the dense spatial information of\nimages in the temporal dimension. In this paper, we find that object motion is\ncontinuous in space, tracking local regions over continuous time enables more\naccurate identification of spatiotemporal feature correlations. In light of\nthis, we propose a novel continuous point tracking-based VFI framework, named\nTimeTracker. Specifically, we first design a Scene-Aware Region Segmentation\n(SARS) module to divide the scene into similar patches. Then, a Continuous\nTrajectory guided Motion Estimation (CTME) module is proposed to track the\ncontinuous motion trajectory of each patch through events. Finally,\nintermediate frames at any given time are generated through global motion\noptimization and frame refinement. Moreover, we collect a real-world dataset\nthat features fast non-linear motion.

Their ability to process and\ngenerate viable text and code has made them ubiquitous in many fields, while\ntheir deployment as knowledge bases and \"reasoning\" tools remains an area of\nongoing research. In geography, a growing body of literature has been focusing\non evaluating LLMs' geographical knowledge and their ability to perform spatial\nreasoning. However, very little is still known about the internal functioning\nof these models, especially about how they process geographical information.\n  In this chapter, we establish a novel framework for the study of geospatial\nmechanistic interpretability - using spatial analysis to reverse engineer how\nLLMs handle geographical information. Our aim is to advance our understanding\nof the internal representations that these complex models generate while\nprocessing geographical information - what one might call \"how LLMs think about\ngeographic information\" if such phrasing was not an undue anthropomorphism.\n  We first outline the use of probing in revealing internal structures within\nLLMs. We then introduce the field of mechanistic interpretability, discussing\nthe superposition hypothesis and the role of sparse autoencoders in\ndisentangling polysemantic internal representations of LLMs into more\ninterpretable, monosemantic features. In our experiments, we use spatial\nautocorrelation to show how features obtained for placenames display spatial\npatterns related to their geographic location and can thus be interpreted\ngeospatially, providing insights into how these models process geographical\ninformation. We conclude by discussing how our framework can help shape the\nstudy and use of foundation models in geography."}

Before the rise of LLM-based agents, a\ncommon strategy was to increase the number of generated patches, sometimes to\nthe thousands, to achieve better repair results on benchmarks. More recently,\nself-iterative capabilities enabled LLMs to refine patches over multiple rounds\nguided by feedback. However, literature often focuses on many iterations and\ndisregards different numbers of outputs.\n  We investigate an APR pipeline that balances these two approaches, the\ngeneration of multiple outputs and multiple rounds of iteration, while imposing\na limit of 10 total patches per bug. We apply three SOTA instruction-tuned LLMs\n- DeepSeekCoder-Instruct, Codellama-Instruct, Llama3.1-Instruct - to the APR\ntask. We further fine-tune each model on an APR dataset with three sizes (1K,\n30K, 65K) and two techniques (Full Fine-Tuning and LoRA), allowing us to assess\ntheir repair capabilities on two APR benchmarks: HumanEval-Java and Defects4J.\n  Our results show that by using only a fraction (<1%) of the fine-tuning\ndataset, we can achieve improvements of up to 78% in the number of plausible\npatches generated, challenging prior studies that reported limited gains using\nFull Fine-Tuning. However, we find that exceeding certain thresholds leads to\ndiminishing outcomes, likely due to overfitting. Moreover, we show that base\nmodels greatly benefit from creating patches in an iterative fashion rather\nthan generating them all at once. In addition, the benefit of iterative\nstrategies becomes more pronounced in complex benchmarks. Even fine-tuned\nmodels, while benefiting less from iterations, still gain advantages,\nparticularly on complex benchmarks. The research underscores the need for\nbalanced APR strategies that combine multi-output generation and iterative\nrefinement."}

Our\nproject aims to address this challenge by developing a machine learning based\nsystem to predict sepsis in its early stages, giving healthcare providers more\ntime to intervene.\n  A major problem with existing models is the wide variability in the patient\ninformation or features they use, such as heart rate, temperature, and lab\nresults.

Before the rise of LLM-based agents, a\ncommon strategy was to increase the number of generated patches, sometimes to\nthe thousands, to achieve better repair results on benchmarks. More recently,\nself-iterative capabilities enabled LLMs to refine patches over multiple rounds\nguided by feedback. However, literature often focuses on many iterations and\ndisregards different numbers of outputs.\n  We investigate an APR pipeline that balances these two approaches, the\ngeneration of multiple outputs and multiple rounds of iteration, while imposing\na limit of 10 total patches per bug. We apply three SOTA instruction-tuned LLMs\n- DeepSeekCoder-Instruct, Codellama-Instruct, Llama3.1-Instruct - to the APR\ntask. We further fine-tune each model on an APR dataset with three sizes (1K,\n30K, 65K) and two techniques (Full Fine-Tuning and LoRA), allowing us to assess\ntheir repair capabilities on two APR benchmarks: HumanEval-Java and Defects4J.\n  Our results show that by using only a fraction (<1%) of the fine-tuning\ndataset, we can achieve improvements of up to 78% in the number of plausible\npatches generated, challenging prior studies that reported limited gains using\nFull Fine-Tuning. However, we find that exceeding certain thresholds leads to\ndiminishing outcomes, likely due to overfitting. Moreover, we show that base\nmodels greatly benefit from creating patches in an iterative fashion rather\nthan generating them all at once. In addition, the benefit of iterative\nstrategies becomes more pronounced in complex benchmarks. Even fine-tuned\nmodels, while benefiting less from iterations, still gain advantages,\nparticularly on complex benchmarks. The research underscores the need for\nbalanced APR strategies that combine multi-output generation and iterative\nrefinement."}

By applying a\ngeneral quantization scheme to this imbalanced cost distribution, existing\nquantization approaches fail to fully exploit potential efficiency gains. To\nthis end, we introduce PROM, a straightforward approach for quantizing modern\ndepthwise-separable convolutional networks by selectively using two distinct\nbit-widths.

The goal is to overcome the intrinsic limitations posed by\nmidresolution products, which affect, e.g., the detection of narrow roads\nwithin vegetated areas and the precise delineation of forested regions\ncontours. To cope with the lack of extended reliable reference datasets at such\na high resolution, we investigate self-supervised learning techniques for\nextracting highly informative representations from the input features, followed\nby a supervised training step with a significantly smaller number of reliable\nlabels. A 1 m resolution forest/non-forest reference map over Pennsylvania,\nUSA, allows for comparing different training approaches for the development of\nan effective forest mapping framework with limited labeled samples.

CoGenAV is\ntrained by optimizing a dual objective derived from natural audio-visual\nsynchrony, contrastive feature alignment and generative text prediction, using\nonly 223 hours of labeled data from the LRS2 dataset. This\ncontrastive-generative synchronization strategy effectively captures\nfundamental cross-modal correlations. We showcase the effectiveness and\nversatility of the learned CoGenAV representations on multiple benchmarks. When\nutilized for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) on LRS2, these\nrepresentations contribute to achieving a state-of-the-art Word Error Rate\n(WER) of 1.27. They also enable strong performance in Visual Speech Recognition\n(VSR) with a WER of 22.0 on LRS2, and significantly improve performance in\nnoisy environments by over 70%. Furthermore, CoGenAV representations benefit\nspeech reconstruction tasks, boosting performance in Speech Enhancement and\nSeparation, and achieve competitive results in audio-visual synchronization\ntasks like Active Speaker Detection (ASD). Our model will be open-sourced to\nfacilitate further development and collaboration within both academia and\nindustry."}

Empirical evidence suggests that oscillatory\nunits outperform threshold units in several tasks including unsupervised object\ndiscovery and certain reasoning problems. The proposed coupling mechanism for\nthese oscillatory neurons is heterogeneous, combining a generalized Kuramoto\nequation with standard coupling methods used for threshold units. In this\nresearch note, we present a theoretical framework that clearly distinguishes\noscillatory neurons from threshold units and establishes a coupling mechanism\nbetween them. We argue that, from a biological standpoint, oscillatory and\nthreshold units realise distinct aspects of neural coding: roughly, threshold\nunits model intensity of neuron firing, while oscillatory units facilitate\ninformation exchange by frequency modulation. To derive interaction between\nthese two types of units, we constrain their dynamics by focusing on dynamical\nsystems that admit Lyapunov functions. For threshold units, this leads to\nHopfield associative memory model, and for oscillatory units it yields a\nspecific form of generalized Kuramoto model. The resulting dynamical systems\ncan be naturally coupled to form a Hopfield-Kuramoto associative memory model,\nwhich also admits a Lyapunov function. Various forms of coupling are possible.\nNotably, oscillatory neurons can be employed to implement a low-rank correction\nto the weight matrix of a Hopfield network. This correction can be viewed\neither as a form of Hebbian learning or as a popular LoRA method used for\nfine-tuning of large language models. We demonstrate the practical realization\nof this particular coupling through illustrative toy experiments."}

Empirical evidence suggests that oscillatory\nunits outperform threshold units in several tasks including unsupervised object\ndiscovery and certain reasoning problems.

In this\nresearch note, we present a theoretical framework that clearly distinguishes\noscillatory neurons from threshold units and establishes a coupling mechanism\nbetween them. We argue that, from a biological standpoint, oscillatory and\nthreshold units realise distinct aspects of neural coding: roughly, threshold\nunits model intensity of neuron firing, while oscillatory units facilitate\ninformation exchange by frequency modulation. To derive interaction between\nthese two types of units, we constrain their dynamics by focusing on dynamical\nsystems that admit Lyapunov functions. For threshold units, this leads to\nHopfield associative memory model, and for oscillatory units it yields a\nspecific form of generalized Kuramoto model. The resulting dynamical systems\ncan be naturally coupled to form a Hopfield-Kuramoto associative memory model,\nwhich also admits a Lyapunov function. Various forms of coupling are possible.\nNotably, oscillatory neurons can be employed to implement a low-rank correction\nto the weight matrix of a Hopfield network.

However, achieving these\ncapabilities on real humanoids remains challenging due to their high degrees of\nfreedom (DoF) and nonlinear dynamics. We propose Adaptive Motion Optimization\n(AMO), a framework that integrates sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) with\ntrajectory optimization for real-time, adaptive whole-body control. To mitigate\ndistribution bias in motion imitation RL, we construct a hybrid AMO dataset and\ntrain a network capable of robust, on-demand adaptation to potentially O.O.D.\ncommands. We validate AMO in simulation and on a 29-DoF Unitree G1 humanoid\nrobot, demonstrating superior stability and an expanded workspace compared to\nstrong baselines. Finally, we show that AMO's consistent performance supports\nautonomous task execution via imitation learning, underscoring the system's\nversatility and robustness."}

However, the existing speech models still\nexperience high latency when generating the first audio token during streaming,\nwhich poses a significant bottleneck for deployment. To address this issue, we\npropose VITA-Audio, an end-to-end large speech model with fast audio-text token\ngeneration. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight Multiple Cross-modal Token\nPrediction (MCTP) module that efficiently generates multiple audio tokens\nwithin a single model forward pass, which not only accelerates the inference\nbut also significantly reduces the latency for generating the first audio in\nstreaming scenarios. In addition, a four-stage progressive training strategy is\nexplored to achieve model acceleration with minimal loss of speech quality. To\nour knowledge, VITA-Audio is the first multi-modal large language model capable\nof generating audio output during the first forward pass, enabling real-time\nconversational capabilities with minimal latency. VITA-Audio is fully\nreproducible and is trained on open-source data only. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our model achieves an inference speedup of 3~5x at the 7B\nparameter scale, but also significantly outperforms open-source models of\nsimilar model size on multiple benchmarks for automatic speech recognition\n(ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), and spoken question answering (SQA) tasks."}
