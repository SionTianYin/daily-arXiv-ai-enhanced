To bridge the gap, we introduce\nSentient Agent as a Judge (SAGE), an automated evaluation framework that\nmeasures an LLM's higher-order social cognition. SAGE instantiates a Sentient\nAgent that simulates human-like emotional changes and inner thoughts during\ninteraction, providing a more realistic evaluation of the tested model in\nmulti-turn conversations. At every turn, the agent reasons about (i) how its\nemotion changes, (ii) how it feels, and (iii) how it should reply, yielding a\nnumerical emotion trajectory and interpretable inner thoughts. Experiments on\n100 supportive-dialogue scenarios show that the final Sentient emotion score\ncorrelates strongly with Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory (BLRI) ratings\nand utterance-level empathy metrics, validating psychological fidelity. We also\nbuild a public Sentient Leaderboard covering 18 commercial and open-source\nmodels that uncovers substantial gaps (up to 4x) between frontier systems\n(GPT-4o-Latest, Gemini2.5-Pro) and earlier baselines, gaps not reflected in\nconventional leaderboards (e.g., Arena).

This\npaper presents a hierarchical concept map-based framework that provides\nstructured knowledge to guide LLMs in generating MCQs with distractors. We\nchose high-school physics as our test domain and began by developing a\nhierarchical concept map covering major Physics topics and their\ninterconnections with an efficient database design. Next, through an automated\npipeline, topic-relevant sections of these concept maps are retrieved to serve\nas a structured context for the LLM to generate questions and distractors that\nspecifically target common misconceptions. Lastly, an automated validation is\ncompleted to ensure that the generated MCQs meet the requirements provided. We\nevaluate our framework against two baseline approaches: a base LLM and a\nRAG-based generation. We conducted expert evaluations and student assessments\nof the generated MCQs. Expert evaluation shows that our method significantly\noutperforms the baseline approaches, achieving a success rate of 75.20% in\nmeeting all quality criteria compared to approximately 37% for both baseline\nmethods. Student assessment data reveal that our concept map-driven approach\nachieved a significantly lower guess success rate of 28.05% compared to 37.10%\nfor the baselines, indicating a more effective assessment of conceptual\nunderstanding.

In this paper, we present a general,\nstructured, scalable framework for evaluating bias in neural image compression\nmodels. Using this framework, we investigate racial bias in neural compression\nalgorithms by analyzing nine popular models and their variants. Through this\ninvestigation, we first demonstrate that traditional distortion metrics are\nineffective in capturing bias in neural compression models. Next, we highlight\nthat racial bias is present in all neural compression models and can be\ncaptured by examining facial phenotype degradation in image reconstructions. We\nthen examine the relationship between bias and realism in the decoded images\nand demonstrate a trade-off across models.

In general, we find that\naudio LMs struggle with long-form speech, with performance declining as\nduration increases. They perform poorly on localization, temporal reasoning,\ncounting, and struggle to understand non-phonemic information, relying more on\nprompts than audio content.

Experimental results demonstrate that\nDF-MCQ achieves unlearning with over 90% refusal rate and a random choice-level\nuncertainty that is much higher than obfuscation on probing questions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5DF-MCQ\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7KL\u6563\u5ea6\u5e73\u5766\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u79fb\u9664\u76ee\u6807\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u62d2\u7edd\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df7\u6dc6\u800c\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u79fb\u9664\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u53d7\u63a2\u6d4b\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDF-MCQ\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528KL\u6563\u5ea6\u5e73\u5766\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u591a\u9009\u9898\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "DF-MCQ\u5728\u63a2\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u7387\u8d85\u8fc790%\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u6df7\u6dc6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DF-MCQ\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6df7\u6dc6\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

Although promising, the association between the\ncomputation cost and the number of identities in the dataset remains linear\nonly with a reduced ratio. A shared characteristic among available FR methods\nis the employment of atomic scalar labels during training. Consequently, the\ninput to label matching is through a dot product between the feature vector of\nthe input and the Softmax centroids. Inspired by generative modeling, we\npresent a simple yet effective method that substitutes scalar labels with\nstructured identity code, i.e., a sequence of integers. Specifically, we\npropose a tokenization scheme that transforms atomic scalar labels into\nstructured identity codes. Then, we train an FR backbone to predict the code\nfor each input instead of its scalar label. As a result, the associated\ncomputational cost becomes logarithmic w.r.t. number of identities. We\ndemonstrate the benefits of the proposed method by conducting experiments. In\nparticular, our method outperforms its competitors by 1.52%, and 0.6% at\nTAR@FAR$=1e-4$ on IJB-B and IJB-C, respectively, while transforming the\nassociation between computational cost and the number of identities from linear\nto logarithmic.

Because sepsis can worsen rapidly, early\ndetection is critical to saving lives. However, current diagnostic methods\noften identify sepsis only after significant damage has already occurred. Our\nproject aims to address this challenge by developing a machine learning based\nsystem to predict sepsis in its early stages, giving healthcare providers more\ntime to intervene.\n  A major problem with existing models is the wide variability in the patient\ninformation or features they use, such as heart rate, temperature, and lab\nresults. This inconsistency makes models difficult to compare and limits their\nability to work across different hospitals and settings. To solve this, we\npropose a method called Feature Aligned Transfer Learning (FATL), which\nidentifies and focuses on the most important and commonly reported features\nacross multiple studies, ensuring the model remains consistent and clinically\nrelevant.\n  Most existing models are trained on narrow patient groups, leading to\npopulation bias. FATL addresses this by combining knowledge from models trained\non diverse populations, using a weighted approach that reflects each models\ncontribution. This makes the system more generalizable and effective across\ndifferent patient demographics and clinical environments.

We analyze the performance of CAE in in-distribution,\nout-of-distribution settings, evaluate drawbacks, and begin to develop\ncomprehensive guidelines for its effective deployment. We find that 1. CAE is\nonly reliably effective when applied to in-distribution contexts. 2. Increasing\nthe number of samples used to generate steering vectors has diminishing returns\nat around 80 samples. 3. Steering vectors are susceptible to adversarial inputs\nthat reverses the behavior that is steered for. 4. Steering vectors harm the\noverall model perplexity. 5. Larger models are more resistant to\nsteering-induced degradation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5de5\u7a0b\uff08CAE\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u96f6\u6210\u672c\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684LLM\u884c\u4e3a\u8c03\u63a7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u884c\u4e3a\u8c03\u63a7\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5de5\u7a0b\uff08CAE\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u6765\u8c03\u63a7\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "CAE\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u573a\u666f\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u6837\u672c\u6570\u91cf\u8d85\u8fc780\u540e\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\uff0c\u4e14\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "CAE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Thus the same network layers are forced to learn\nboth structural and textural information simultaneously, significantly\ndiffering from the traditional deep learning architectures (e.g., ResNet or\nGANs) which captures or generates the image semantic information at different\nlayers. This difference inspires us to explore the time-wise diffusion models.\nWe initially investigate the key contributions of the U-Net parameters to the\ndenoising process and identify that properly zeroing out certain parameters\n(including large parameters) contributes to denoising, substantially improving\nthe generation quality on the fly. Capitalizing on this discovery, we propose a\nsimple yet effective method-termed ``MaskUNet''- that enhances generation\nquality with negligible parameter numbers.

Given the\npractical challenges associated with acquiring paired MRI and CT scans, the\ndevelopment of robust methods capable of leveraging unpaired datasets is\nessential for advancing the MRI-to-CT translation. Current unpaired MRI-to-CT\ntranslation methods, which predominantly rely on cycle consistency and\ncontrastive learning frameworks, frequently encounter challenges in accurately\ntranslating anatomical features that are highly discernible on CT but less\ndistinguishable on MRI, such as bone structures. This limitation renders these\napproaches less suitable for applications in radiation therapy, where precise\nbone representation is essential for accurate treatment planning. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a path- and bone-contour regularized approach for\nunpaired MRI-to-CT translation. In our method, MRI and CT images are projected\nto a shared latent space, where the MRI-to-CT mapping is modeled as a\ncontinuous flow governed by neural ordinary differential equations. The optimal\nmapping is obtained by minimizing the transition path length of the flow. To\nenhance the accuracy of translated bone structures, we introduce a trainable\nneural network to generate bone contours from MRI and implement mechanisms to\ndirectly and indirectly encourage the model to focus on bone contours and their\nadjacent regions. Evaluations conducted on three datasets demonstrate that our\nmethod outperforms existing unpaired MRI-to-CT translation approaches,\nachieving lower overall error rates.

A hurdle for event-based VFI is how to effectively deal\nwith non-linear motion, caused by the dynamic changes in motion direction and\nspeed within the scene. Existing methods either use events to estimate sparse\noptical flow or fuse events with image features to estimate dense optical flow.\nUnfortunately, motion errors often degrade the VFI quality as the continuous\nmotion cues from events do not align with the dense spatial information of\nimages in the temporal dimension. In this paper, we find that object motion is\ncontinuous in space, tracking local regions over continuous time enables more\naccurate identification of spatiotemporal feature correlations. In light of\nthis, we propose a novel continuous point tracking-based VFI framework, named\nTimeTracker. Specifically, we first design a Scene-Aware Region Segmentation\n(SARS) module to divide the scene into similar patches. Then, a Continuous\nTrajectory guided Motion Estimation (CTME) module is proposed to track the\ncontinuous motion trajectory of each patch through events. Finally,\nintermediate frames at any given time are generated through global motion\noptimization and frame refinement.

Recent\ndevelopments demonstrate that the latest class of models are able to integrate\nstructured and unstructured data, assist in hypothesis generation, and\nstreamline research workflows. To explore the frontier of LLM capabilities\nacross the research lifecycle, we review applications of LLMs through 34 total\nprojects developed during the second annual Large Language Model Hackathon for\nApplications in Materials Science and Chemistry, a global hybrid event. These\nprojects spanned seven key research areas: (1) molecular and material property\nprediction, (2) molecular and material design, (3) automation and novel\ninterfaces, (4) scientific communication and education, (5) research data\nmanagement and automation, (6) hypothesis generation and evaluation, and (7)\nknowledge extraction and reasoning from the scientific literature.\nCollectively, these applications illustrate how LLMs serve as versatile\npredictive models, platforms for rapid prototyping of domain-specific tools,\nand much more.

The evaluation of machine learning models often focuses on data\nslices, which are subsets of the data that share a set of characteristics.

However, alongside these advancements, there have been increasing\nconcerns about reproducing the results of these deep learning methods. This is\nsignificant because reproducibility is the foundation of reliability and\nvalidity in software development, particularly in the rapidly evolving domain\nof deep learning. The difficulty of reproducibility may arise due to several\nreasons, including having differences from the original execution environment,\nincompatible software libraries, proprietary data and source code, lack of\ntransparency, and the stochastic nature in some software. A study conducted by\nthe Nature journal reveals that more than 70% of researchers failed to\nreproduce other researchers experiments and over 50% failed to reproduce their\nown experiments. Irreproducibility of deep learning poses significant\nchallenges for researchers and practitioners. To address these concerns, this\npaper presents a systematic approach at analyzing and improving the\nreproducibility of deep learning models by demonstrating these guidelines using\na case study. We illustrate the patterns and anti-patterns involved with these\nguidelines for improving the reproducibility of deep learning models.

Quantization effectively compresses these models,\nreducing storage size and energy cost. However, in modern depthwise-separable\narchitectures, the computational cost is distributed unevenly across its\ncomponents, with pointwise operations being the most expensive. By applying a\ngeneral quantization scheme to this imbalanced cost distribution, existing\nquantization approaches fail to fully exploit potential efficiency gains. To\nthis end, we introduce PROM, a straightforward approach for quantizing modern\ndepthwise-separable convolutional networks by selectively using two distinct\nbit-widths. Specifically, pointwise convolutions are quantized to ternary\nweights, while the remaining modules use 8-bit weights, which is achieved\nthrough a simple quantization-aware training procedure. Additionally, by\nquantizing activations to 8-bit, our method transforms pointwise convolutions\nwith ternary weights into int8 additions, which enjoy broad support across\nhardware platforms and effectively eliminates the need for expensive\nmultiplications. Applying PROM to MobileNetV2 reduces the model's energy cost\nby more than an order of magnitude (23.9x) and its storage size by 2.7x\ncompared to the float16 baseline while retaining similar classification\nperformance on ImageNet. Our method advances the Pareto frontier for energy\nconsumption vs. top-1 accuracy for quantized convolutional models on ImageNet.\nPROM addresses the challenges of quantizing depthwise-separable convolutional\nnetworks to both ternary and 8-bit weights, offering a simple way to reduce\nenergy cost and storage size.", "AI": {"tldr": "PROM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u5143\u548c8\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff1a\u70b9\u5377\u79ef\u7528\u4e09\u5143\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5176\u4f59\u6a21\u5757\u75288\u4f4d\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "MobileNetV2\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e23.9\u500d\uff0c\u5b58\u50a8\u51cf\u5c112.7\u500d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "PROM\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u3002"}}

We apply three SOTA instruction-tuned LLMs\n- DeepSeekCoder-Instruct, Codellama-Instruct, Llama3.1-Instruct - to the APR\ntask. We further fine-tune each model on an APR dataset with three sizes (1K,\n30K, 65K) and two techniques (Full Fine-Tuning and LoRA), allowing us to assess\ntheir repair capabilities on two APR benchmarks: HumanEval-Java and Defects4J.\n  Our results show that by using only a fraction (<1%) of the fine-tuning\ndataset, we can achieve improvements of up to 78% in the number of plausible\npatches generated, challenging prior studies that reported limited gains using\nFull Fine-Tuning. However, we find that exceeding certain thresholds leads to\ndiminishing outcomes, likely due to overfitting. Moreover, we show that base\nmodels greatly benefit from creating patches in an iterative fashion rather\nthan generating them all at once. In addition, the benefit of iterative\nstrategies becomes more pronounced in complex benchmarks. Even fine-tuned\nmodels, while benefiting less from iterations, still gain advantages,\nparticularly on complex benchmarks. The research underscores the need for\nbalanced APR strategies that combine multi-output generation and iterative\nrefinement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\uff08APR\uff09\u4e2d\u591a\u8f93\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u591a\u8f6e\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u603b\u8865\u4e01\u6570\u4e3a10\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18LLM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5fae\u8c03\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5373\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4fee\u590d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5fae\u8c03\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\u3002\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5c24\u5176\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\uff08APR\uff09\u4e2d\u591a\u8f93\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u591a\u8f6e\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u4fee\u590d\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9650\u5236\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18LLM\uff08DeepSeekCoder-Instruct\u3001Codellama-Instruct\u3001Llama3.1-Instruct\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff081K\u300130K\u300165K\uff09\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0eLoRA\uff09\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fee\u590d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e8eHumanEval-Java\u548cDefects4J\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5fae\u8c03\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08<1%\uff09\u53ef\u63d0\u534778%\u7684\u5408\u7406\u8865\u4e01\u751f\u6210\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5fae\u8c03\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\u3002\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u3002\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u53d7\u76ca\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u80fd\u4ece\u4e2d\u83b7\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u8f93\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5e73\u8861APR\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Specifically, we adopt an\nexploration-driven reinforcement fine-tuning approach to elicit and incentivize\nthe model's latent complex reasoning ability: (1) We first use a small amount\nof image generation preference data to distill the reasoning process of GPT-4o,\nwhich is then used for the model's cold start to learn the format and structure\nof CoT reasoning. (2) Subsequently, by leveraging the model's prior knowledge\nand generalization capabilities, we prepare large-scale unified multimodal\npreference data to elicit the model's reasoning process across various vision\ntasks. During this phase, correct reasoning outputs are retained for rejection\nsampling to refine the model (3) while incorrect predicted samples are finally\nused for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based reinforcement\nfine-tuning, enabling the model to explore diverse reasoning paths and optimize\nfor correct and robust solutions. Extensive experiments across various vision\nreward tasks demonstrate the superiority of our model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faUnifiedReward-Think\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u957f\u94fe\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08RMs\uff09\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u65f6\u4ec5\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u6d45\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u957f\u94fe\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u63a2\u7d22\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u84b8\u998fGPT-4o\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b2) \u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u751f\u6210\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7GRPO\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u5956\u52b1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "conclusion": "UnifiedReward-Think\u901a\u8fc7\u957f\u94fe\u601d\u7ef4\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Effective model performance and feature\nselection are fundamental for explainability and reliability. In many cases,\nhigh dimensional omics datasets suffer from limited number of samples due to\nclinical constraints, patient conditions, phenotypes rarity and others\nconditions. Current omics based classification models often suffer from narrow\ninterpretability, making it difficult to discern meaningful insights where\ntrust and reproducibility are critical. This study presents a machine learning\nbased classification framework that integrates feature selection with data\naugmentation techniques to achieve high standard classification accuracy while\nensuring better interpretability.

The key novelty of\nlingual-backdoor attacks is that the language itself serves as the trigger to\nhijack the infected LLMs to generate inflammatory speech. They enable the\nprecise targeting of a specific language-speaking group, exacerbating racial\ndiscrimination by malicious entities. We first implement a baseline\nlingual-backdoor attack, which is carried out by poisoning a set of training\ndata for specific downstream tasks through translation into the trigger\nlanguage.

To address this challenge, we design\nBadLingual, a novel task-agnostic lingual-backdoor, capable of triggering any\ndownstream tasks within the chat LLMs, regardless of the specific questions of\nthese tasks. We design a new approach using PPL-constrained Greedy Coordinate\nGradient-based Search (PGCG) based adversarial training to expand the decision\nboundary of lingual-backdoor, thereby enhancing the generalization ability of\nlingual-backdoor across various tasks. We perform extensive experiments to\nvalidate the effectiveness of our proposed attacks. Specifically, the baseline\nattack achieves an ASR of over 90% on the specified tasks. However, its ASR\nreaches only 37.61% across six tasks in the task-agnostic scenario. In\ncontrast, BadLingual brings up to 37.35% improvement over the baseline.

In this work, we establish\nthe first non-asymptotic Wasserstein-2 convergence guarantees for SGMs\ntargeting semiconvex distributions with potentially discontinuous gradients.\nOur upper bounds are explicit and sharp in key parameters, achieving optimal\ndependence of $O(\\sqrt{d})$ on the data dimension $d$ and convergence rate of\norder one. The framework accommodates a wide class of practically relevant\ndistributions, including symmetric modified half-normal distributions, Gaussian\nmixtures, double-well potentials, and elastic net potentials. By leveraging\nsemiconvexity without requiring smoothness assumptions on the potential such as\ndifferentiability, our results substantially broaden the theoretical\nfoundations of SGMs, bridging the gap between empirical success and rigorous\nguarantees in non-smooth, complex data regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u4e3a\u975e\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684Score-based\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08SGMs\uff09\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1Wasserstein-2\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u653e\u5bbd\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u6b63\u5219\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1SGMs\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f3a\u6b63\u5219\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u6216\u4e25\u683c\u5bf9\u6570\u51f9\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u5f88\u5c11\u6ee1\u8db3\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u534a\u51f8\u6027\uff08semiconvexity\uff09\u800c\u4e0d\u8981\u6c42\u6f5c\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\uff08\u5982\u53ef\u5fae\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1Wasserstein-2\u6536\u655b\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u4e0a\u754c\u5728\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\u4e0a\u663e\u5f0f\u4e14\u5c16\u9510\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u7ef4\u5ea6$d$\u4e0a\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u4f9d\u8d56$O(\\sqrt{d})$\u548c\u9636\u6570\u4e3a1\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u3002\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5b9e\u9645\u76f8\u5173\u5206\u5e03\uff08\u5982\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u3001\u53cc\u9631\u52bf\u7b49\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u663e\u8457\u62d3\u5bbd\u4e86SGMs\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

The transfer-based\nattack is a hot topic in black-box attacks that are practical to real-world\nscenarios where the training datasets, parameters, and structure of the target\nmodel are unknown to the attacker.

Accordingly we then propose a\nnovel attack method named Attention-aggregated Attack (AAA) to enhance the\ntransferability of adversarial examples against FR, which is inspired by the\nattention divergence and aims to destroy the facial features that are critical\nfor the decision-making of other FR models by imitating their attentions on the\nclean face images.

First, we leverage\nergodicity to build simple generative flows with finitely many globally defined\ntransformations (diffeomorphisms) with universality guarantees and tractable\nflow-matching loss (FM loss). Second, we introduce a new loss involving\ncross-entropy coupled to weak flow-matching control, coined KL-weakFM loss. It\nis designed for IL training without a separate reward model. We evaluate\nIL-EGFs on toy 2D tasks and real-world datasets from NASA on the sphere, using\nthe KL-weakFM loss.

Here, we introduce Anant-Net, an efficient neural surrogate\nthat overcomes this challenge, enabling the solution of PDEs in high\ndimensions.

While deep learning-based human pose\nestimation (HPE) models from RGB videos have achieved impressive performance on\npublic datasets, their effectiveness in real-world sports scenarios is often\nhindered by motion blur, occlusions, and domain shifts across different pose\nrepresentations. Fine-tuning these models can partially alleviate such\nchallenges but typically requires large-scale annotated data and still\nstruggles to generalize across diverse sports environments. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a 2D pose prior-guided refinement approach based on\nNeural Distance Fields (NDF). Unlike existing approaches that rely solely on\nangular representations of human poses, we introduce a polar coordinate-based\nrepresentation that explicitly incorporates joint connection lengths, enabling\na more accurate correction of erroneous pose estimations. Additionally, we\ndefine a novel non-geodesic distance metric that separates angular and radial\ndiscrepancies, which we demonstrate is better suited for polar representations\nthan traditional geodesic distances. To mitigate data scarcity, we develop a\ngradient-based batch-projection augmentation strategy, which synthesizes\nrealistic pose samples through iterative refinement.

Traditional methods struggle\nwith the extreme limited-angle problems inherent in nonperiodic cases.

In this problem, we\nsequentially receive $n$ stochastic requests for $m$ kinds of shared resources,\nwhere each request can be satisfied in multiple ways, consuming different\namounts of resources and generating different values. The goal is to achieve a\n$(1-\\epsilon)$-approximation to the hindsight optimum, where $\\epsilon>0$ is a\nsmall constant, assuming each resource has a large budget.\n  In this paper, we investigate the learnability and robustness of online\nresource allocation. Our primary contribution is a novel Exponential Pricing\nalgorithm with the following properties: 1. It requires only a \\emph{single\nsample} from each of the $n$ request distributions to achieve a\n$(1-\\epsilon)$-approximation for online resource allocation with large budgets.\nSuch an algorithm was previously unknown, even with access to polynomially many\nsamples, as prior work either assumed full distributional knowledge or was\nlimited to i.i.d.\\,or random-order arrivals. 2. It is robust to corruptions in\nthe outliers model and the value augmentation model. Specifically, it maintains\nits $(1 - \\epsilon)$-approximation guarantee under both these robustness\nmodels, resolving the open question posed in Argue, Gupta, Molinaro, and Singla\n(SODA'22). 3. It operates as a simple item-pricing algorithm that ensures\nincentive compatibility.\n  The intuition behind our Exponential Pricing algorithm is that the price of a\nresource should adjust exponentially as it is overused or underused. It differs\nfrom conventional approaches that use an online learning algorithm for item\npricing. This departure guarantees that the algorithm will never run out of any\nresource, but loses the usual no-regret properties of online learning\nalgorithms, necessitating a new analytical approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6307\u6570\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7ebf\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5355\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0(1-\u03b5)\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6fc0\u52b1\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u7ebf\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5b8c\u5168\u5206\u5e03\u77e5\u8bc6\u6216\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6307\u6570\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d44\u6e90\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u6307\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0d\u4f1a\u8017\u5c3d\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5355\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0(1-\u03b5)\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6307\u6570\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

The proposed Prompt-based Restoration\nAttention (PRA) optimizes semantic decoding by prompt guidance and\nself-adaptive correction, while Bilevel Prompt Distribution Learning (BPDL)\nrefines the manifold of per-pixel mask embeddings via semantic prototype\nsupervision. Besides, to compensate for the scarcity of PanOoS datasets, we\nestablish two benchmarks: DenseOoS, which features diverse outliers in complex\nenvironments, and QuadOoS, captured by a quadruped robot with a panoramic\nannular lens system. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance of\nPOS, with AuPRC improving by 34.25% and FPR95 decreasing by 21.42% on DenseOoS,\noutperforming state-of-the-art pinhole-OoS methods. Moreover, POS achieves\nleading closed-set segmentation capabilities.

BoN\nsampling is performed by generating $n$ responses to a prompt and then\nselecting the sample that maximizes a reward function. BoN yields high reward\nvalues in practice at a distortion cost, as measured by the KL-divergence\nbetween the sampled and original distribution. This distortion is coarsely\ncontrolled by varying the number of samples: larger $n$ yields a higher reward\nat a higher distortion cost.

This task plays a key role in\nvarious real-world applications, such as sign language video generation, AR/VR,\ngaming, and live streaming. In these scenarios, real-time PGPIS is critical for\nproviding immediate visual feedback and maintaining user immersion.However,\nachieving real-time performance remains a significant challenge due to the\ncomplexity of synthesizing high-fidelity images from diverse and dynamic human\nposes. Recent diffusion-based methods have shown impressive image quality in\nPGPIS, but their slow sampling speeds hinder deployment in time-sensitive\napplications. This latency is particularly problematic in tasks like generating\nsign language videos during live broadcasts, where rapid image updates are\nrequired. Therefore, developing a fast and reliable PGPIS model is a crucial\nstep toward enabling real-time interactive systems. To address this challenge,\nwe propose a generative model based on flow matching (FM). Our approach enables\nfaster, more stable, and more efficient training and sampling. Furthermore, the\nproposed model supports conditional generation and can operate in latent space,\nmaking it especially suitable for real-time PGPIS applications where both speed\nand quality are critical. We evaluate our proposed method, Real-Time Person\nImage Synthesis Using a Flow Matching Model (RPFM), on the widely used\nDeepFashion dataset for PGPIS tasks. Our results show that RPFM achieves\nnear-real-time sampling speeds while maintaining performance comparable to the\nstate-of-the-art models.

Moreover, the limitations\nof an individual LLM's training data, aggravated by the potential maliciousness\nof its hosting device, can result in responses with low confidence or even\nbias.

However, designing a robust\nrepresentation that effectively handles diverse fingerprint modalities, pose\nvariations, and noise interference remains a significant challenge. In this\nwork, we propose a fixed-length dense descriptor of fingerprints, and introduce\nFLARE-a fingerprint matching framework that integrates the Fixed-Length dense\ndescriptor with pose-based Alignment and Robust Enhancement. This fixed-length\nrepresentation employs a three-dimensional dense descriptor to effectively\ncapture spatial relationships among fingerprint ridge structures, enabling\nrobust and locally discriminative representations. To ensure consistency within\nthis dense feature space, FLARE incorporates pose-based alignment using\ncomplementary estimation methods, along with dual enhancement strategies that\nrefine ridge clarity while preserving the original fingerprint modality. The\nproposed dense descriptor supports fixed-length representation while\nmaintaining spatial correspondence, enabling fast and accurate similarity\ncomputation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FLARE achieves superior\nperformance across rolled, plain, latent, and contactless fingerprints,\nsignificantly outperforming existing methods in cross-modality and low-quality\nscenarios. Further analysis validates the effectiveness of the dense descriptor\ndesign, as well as the impact of alignment and enhancement modules on the\naccuracy of dense descriptor matching.

Our SPAS proposes to help users to\ncompose a good shot of a scene by automatically guiding the users to adjust the\ncamera pose live on the scene. We first constructed a large dataset containing\n320K images with camera pose information from 4000 scenes. We then developed an\ninnovative CLIP-based Composition Quality Assessment (CCQA) model to assign\npseudo labels to these images. The CCQA introduces a unique learnable text\nembedding technique to learn continuous word embeddings capable of discerning\nsubtle visual quality differences in the range covered by five levels of\nquality description words {bad, poor, fair, good, perfect}. And finally we have\ndeveloped a camera pose adjustment model (CPAM) which first determines if the\ncurrent view can be further improved and if so it outputs the adjust suggestion\nin the form of two camera pose adjustment angles. The two tasks of CPAM make\ndecisions in a sequential manner and each involves different sets of training\nsamples, we have developed a mixture-of-experts model with a gated loss\nfunction to train the CPAM in an end-to-end manner.

This study introduces a novel\napproach to direct image harmonization, moving beyond feature standardization\nto ensure that extracted features remain inherently reliable for downstream\nanalysis. Our method enables image transfer in two ways: (1) mapping images to\na scanner-free space for uniform appearance across all scanners, and (2)\ntransforming images into the domain of a specific scanner used in model\ntraining, embedding its unique characteristics. Our approach presents strong\ngeneralization capability, even for unseen scanners not included in the\ntraining phase. We validated our method using MR images from diverse cohorts,\nincluding healthy controls, traveling subjects, and individuals with\nAlzheimer's disease (AD). The model's effectiveness is tested in multiple\napplications, such as brain age prediction (R2 = 0.60 \\pm 0.05), biomarker\nextraction, AD classification (Test Accuracy = 0.86 \\pm 0.03), and diagnosis\nprediction (AUC = 0.95). In all cases, our harmonization technique outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods, showing improvements in both reliability and\npredictive accuracy. Moreover, our approach eliminates the need for extensive\npreprocessing steps, such as skull-stripping, which can introduce errors by\nmisclassifying brain and non-brain structures. This makes our method\nparticularly suitable for applications that require full-head analysis,\nincluding research on head trauma and cranial deformities. Additionally, our\nharmonization model does not require retraining for new datasets, allowing\nsmooth integration into various neuroimaging workflows.

Current methods use pose-guided or\nglobal motion customization but are limited by strict constraints on spatial\nstructure, such as layout, skeleton, and viewpoint consistency, reducing\nadaptability across diverse subjects and scenarios. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose FlexiAct, which transfers actions from a reference\nvideo to an arbitrary target image. Unlike existing methods, FlexiAct allows\nfor variations in layout, viewpoint, and skeletal structure between the subject\nof the reference video and the target image, while maintaining identity\nconsistency. Achieving this requires precise action control, spatial structure\nadaptation, and consistency preservation. To this end, we introduce RefAdapter,\na lightweight image-conditioned adapter that excels in spatial adaptation and\nconsistency preservation, surpassing existing methods in balancing appearance\nconsistency and structural flexibility. Additionally, based on our\nobservations, the denoising process exhibits varying levels of attention to\nmotion (low frequency) and appearance details (high frequency) at different\ntimesteps. So we propose FAE (Frequency-aware Action Extraction), which, unlike\nexisting methods that rely on separate spatial-temporal architectures, directly\nachieves action extraction during the denoising process. Experiments\ndemonstrate that our method effectively transfers actions to subjects with\ndiverse layouts, skeletons, and viewpoints.

Moreover, QR codes can encode\nvarious types of data beyond URLs, such as Wi-Fi credentials and payment\ninformation, making URL-based detection insufficient for broader security\nconcerns. To address these gaps, we propose the first framework for quishing\ndetection that directly analyzes QR code structure and pixel patterns without\nextracting the embedded content. We generated a dataset of phishing and benign\nQR codes and we used it to train and evaluate multiple machine learning models,\nincluding Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes,\nLightGBM, and XGBoost. Our best-performing model (XGBoost) achieves an AUC of\n0.9106, demonstrating the feasibility of QR-centric detection.

Empirical evidence suggests that oscillatory\nunits outperform threshold units in several tasks including unsupervised object\ndiscovery and certain reasoning problems. The proposed coupling mechanism for\nthese oscillatory neurons is heterogeneous, combining a generalized Kuramoto\nequation with standard coupling methods used for threshold units. In this\nresearch note, we present a theoretical framework that clearly distinguishes\noscillatory neurons from threshold units and establishes a coupling mechanism\nbetween them. We argue that, from a biological standpoint, oscillatory and\nthreshold units realise distinct aspects of neural coding: roughly, threshold\nunits model intensity of neuron firing, while oscillatory units facilitate\ninformation exchange by frequency modulation. To derive interaction between\nthese two types of units, we constrain their dynamics by focusing on dynamical\nsystems that admit Lyapunov functions. For threshold units, this leads to\nHopfield associative memory model, and for oscillatory units it yields a\nspecific form of generalized Kuramoto model. The resulting dynamical systems\ncan be naturally coupled to form a Hopfield-Kuramoto associative memory model,\nwhich also admits a Lyapunov function. Various forms of coupling are possible.\nNotably, oscillatory neurons can be employed to implement a low-rank correction\nto the weight matrix of a Hopfield network.
