### [1] [Shop-R1: Rewarding LLMs to Simulate Human Behavior in Online Shopping via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17842)
*Yimeng Zhang,Tian Wang,Jiri Gesi,Ziyi Wang,Yuxuan Lu,Jiacheng Lin,Sinong Zhan,Vianne Gao,Ruochen Jiao,Junze Liu,Kun Qian,Yuxin Tang,Ran Xue,Houyu Zhang,Qingjun Cui,Yufan Guo,Dakuo Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Shop-R1是一种新的强化学习框架，通过分阶段生成理由和预测动作，结合自监督和分层奖励机制，显著提升了LLM在在线购物环境中模拟人类行为的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于LLM生成的理由进行监督微调，但其性能受限于模型的推理能力。Shop-R1旨在通过强化学习框架提升LLM的推理能力，以更真实地模拟人类行为。

Method: Shop-R1将任务分解为理由生成和动作预测两个阶段，分别采用自监督信号和分层奖励机制。理由生成利用内部模型信号，动作预测采用难度感知的分层奖励结构。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法相比基线提升了65%以上的性能。

Conclusion: Shop-R1通过分阶段设计和分层奖励机制，有效提升了LLM在复杂任务中的推理和行为模拟能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in
generating 'believable human-like' behavior in web environments. Prior work has
explored augmenting training data with LLM-synthesized rationales and applying
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance reasoning ability, which in turn can
improve downstream action prediction. However, the performance of such
approaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the
model used to generate the rationales. In this paper, we introduce Shop-R1, a
novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning
ability of LLMs for simulation of real human behavior in online shopping
environments Specifically, Shop-R1 decomposes the human behavior simulation
task into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided
by distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, we leverage internal
model signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a
self-supervised manner. For action prediction, we propose a hierarchical reward
structure with difficulty-aware scaling to prevent reward hacking and enable
fine-grained reward assignment. This design evaluates both high-level action
types and the correctness of fine-grained sub-action details (attributes and
values), rewarding outputs proportionally to their difficulty. Experimental
results show that our method achieves a relative improvement of over 65%
compared to the baseline.

### [2] [Dynamic and Generalizable Process Reward Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17849)
*Zhangyue Yin,Qiushi Sun,Zhiyuan Zeng,Qinyuan Cheng,Xipeng Qiu,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DG-PRM提出了一种动态且通用的过程奖励建模方法，通过奖励树和多维奖励标准提升LLM在复杂任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRM依赖启发式方法，难以跨领域泛化，且静态评估标准无法适应复杂过程监督。

Method: DG-PRM采用奖励树存储细粒度奖励标准，动态选择奖励信号，并利用Pareto优势估计处理多维度信号。

Result: 实验显示DG-PRM在基准测试中表现优异，显著提升模型性能，且适应分布外场景。

Conclusion: DG-PRM具有出色的通用性和适应性，为复杂任务提供了有效的奖励建模解决方案。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial for guiding Large Language Models
(LLMs) in complex scenarios by providing dense reward signals. However,
existing PRMs primarily rely on heuristic approaches, which struggle with
cross-domain generalization. While LLM-as-judge has been proposed to provide
generalized rewards, current research has focused mainly on feedback results,
overlooking the meaningful guidance embedded within the text. Additionally,
static and coarse-grained evaluation criteria struggle to adapt to complex
process supervision. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic and
Generalizable Process Reward Modeling (DG-PRM), which features a reward tree to
capture and store fine-grained, multi-dimensional reward criteria. DG-PRM
dynamically selects reward signals for step-wise reward scoring. To handle
multifaceted reward signals, we pioneeringly adopt Pareto dominance estimation
to identify discriminative positive and negative pairs. Experimental results
show that DG-PRM achieves stunning performance on prevailing benchmarks,
significantly boosting model performance across tasks with dense rewards.
Further analysis reveals that DG-PRM adapts well to out-of-distribution
scenarios, demonstrating exceptional generalizability.

### [3] [VeriMinder: Mitigating Analytical Vulnerabilities in NL2SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17896)
*Shubham Mohole,Sainyam Galhotra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VeriMinder是一个交互式系统，用于检测和减轻自然语言数据库接口中的认知偏差，通过语义映射、分析框架和优化的LLM技术提升分析质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帮助缺乏统计背景的用户避免在数据提问中引入认知偏差，提升分析问题的质量。

Method: 引入上下文语义映射框架、基于Hard-to-Vary原则的分析框架，以及优化的LLM生成任务特定提示。

Result: 用户测试显示82.5%参与者认可分析质量提升，VeriMinder在具体性、全面性和准确性上比替代方法高20%。

Conclusion: VeriMinder有效减少数据分析中的“错误问题”漏洞，代码开源以促进社区研究和应用。

Abstract: Application systems using natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDBs)
have democratized data analysis. This positive development has also brought
forth an urgent challenge to help users who might use these systems without a
background in statistical analysis to formulate bias-free analytical questions.
Although significant research has focused on text-to-SQL generation accuracy,
addressing cognitive biases in analytical questions remains underexplored. We
present VeriMinder, https://veriminder.ai, an interactive system for detecting
and mitigating such analytical vulnerabilities. Our approach introduces three
key innovations: (1) a contextual semantic mapping framework for biases
relevant to specific analysis contexts (2) an analytical framework that
operationalizes the Hard-to-Vary principle and guides users in systematic data
analysis (3) an optimized LLM-powered system that generates high-quality,
task-specific prompts using a structured process involving multiple candidates,
critic feedback, and self-reflection.
  User testing confirms the merits of our approach. In direct user experience
evaluation, 82.5% participants reported positively impacting the quality of the
analysis. In comparative evaluation, VeriMinder scored significantly higher
than alternative approaches, at least 20% better when considered for metrics of
the analysis's concreteness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy. Our system,
implemented as a web application, is set to help users avoid "wrong question"
vulnerability during data analysis. VeriMinder code base with prompts,
https://reproducibility.link/veriminder, is available as an MIT-licensed
open-source software to facilitate further research and adoption within the
community.

### [4] [One Whisper to Grade Them All](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17918)
*Nhan Phan,Anusha Porwal,Yaroslav Getman,Ekaterina Voskoboinik,Tamás Grósz,Mikko Kurimo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的端到端自动口语评估方法，通过单一Whisper-small编码器处理多部分口语测试，减少推理时间并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模计算机辅助语言学习系统中自动口语评估的效率和实用性问题。

Method: 使用单一Whisper-small编码器处理所有口语响应，结合轻量级聚合器预测最终分数，无需转录和分部分模型。

Result: 系统RMSE为0.384，优于文本基线（0.44），参数仅为Whisper-small的70%，数据采样策略使模型仅需44.8%的说话者数据即可达到0.383 RMSE。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且数据利用率高，适用于大规模语言学习系统。

Abstract: We present an efficient end-to-end approach for holistic Automatic Speaking
Assessment (ASA) of multi-part second-language tests, developed for the 2025
Speak & Improve Challenge. Our system's main novelty is the ability to process
all four spoken responses with a single Whisper-small encoder, combine all
information via a lightweight aggregator, and predict the final score. This
architecture removes the need for transcription and per-part models, cuts
inference time, and makes ASA practical for large-scale Computer-Assisted
Language Learning systems.
  Our system achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.384, outperforming
the text-based baseline (0.44) while using at most 168M parameters (about 70%
of Whisper-small). Furthermore, we propose a data sampling strategy, allowing
the model to train on only 44.8% of the speakers in the corpus and still reach
0.383 RMSE, demonstrating improved performance on imbalanced classes and strong
data efficiency.

### [5] [Evaluating the Performance of AI Text Detectors, Few-Shot and Chain-of-Thought Prompting Using DeepSeek Generated Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17944)
*Hulayyil Alshammari,Praveen Rao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了六种AI检测工具对DeepSeek生成文本的识别能力，发现对抗攻击（如改写和人化）显著降低检测准确性，而Few-shot和CoT提示方法表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注ChatGPT等知名LLM，缺乏对DeepSeek的检测能力评估，因此填补这一空白。

Method: 使用六种检测工具测试DeepSeek生成文本及其对抗攻击版本，并评估Few-shot和CoT提示方法的分类效果。

Result: QuillBot和Copyleaks在原始和改写文本上表现优异，但人化攻击显著降低准确性；Few-shot和CoT提示方法准确率高达96%以上。

Conclusion: 对抗攻击削弱检测工具性能，Few-shot和CoT提示是有效的替代方案，需进一步优化检测技术。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the creation of written
materials. LLMs have led to questions about writing integrity, thereby driving
the creation of artificial intelligence (AI) detection technologies.
Adversarial attacks, such as standard and humanized paraphrasing, inhibit
detectors' ability to detect machine-generated text. Previous studies have
mainly focused on ChatGPT and other well-known LLMs and have shown varying
accuracy across detectors. However, there is a clear gap in the literature
about DeepSeek, a recently published LLM. Therefore, in this work, we
investigate whether six generally accessible AI detection tools -- AI Text
Classifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero -- can
consistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek. The detectors were exposed
to the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a
detector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT)
for classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored
question-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses
using DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied
adversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more
samples. These were used to challenge detector robustness and assess accuracy
impact. While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on
original and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text
Classifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack
was humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and
52% for GPTZero. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy, with the best
five-shot result misclassifying only one of 49 samples (AI recall 96%, human
recall 100%).

*Sohaib Imran,Ihor Kendiukhov,Matthew Broerman,Aditya Thomas,Riccardo Campanella,Rob Lamb,Peter M. Atkinson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨大型语言模型是否更符合贝叶斯定理更新信念，提出BCC指标验证假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证更大、更强大的语言模型是否在上下文中更一致地遵循贝叶斯定理更新信念。

Method: 提出贝叶斯一致性系数（BCC）指标，生成数据集测量BCC，对比模型参数、训练数据量和基准测试分数。

Result: 更大、更强大的预训练语言模型的信念更新更符合贝叶斯定理。

Conclusion: 结果对理解和治理大型语言模型具有重要意义。

Abstract: Do larger and more capable language models learn to update their "beliefs"
about propositions more consistently with Bayes' theorem when presented with
evidence in-context? To test this, we formulate a Bayesian Coherence
Coefficient (BCC) metric and generate a dataset with which to measure the BCC.
We measure BCC for multiple pre-trained-only language models across five model
families, comparing against the number of model parameters, the amount of
training data, and model scores on common benchmarks. Our results provide
evidence for our hypothesis that larger and more capable pre-trained language
models assign credences that are more coherent with Bayes' theorem. These
results have important implications for our understanding and governance of
LLMs.

### [9] [NeuralDB: Scaling Knowledge Editing in LLMs to 100,000 Facts with Neural KV Database](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18028)
*Weizhi Fei,Hao Shi,Jing Xu,Jingchen Peng,Jiazheng Li,Jingzhao Zhang,Bo Bai,Wei Han,Zhenyuan Chen,Xueyan Niu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NeuralDB提出了一种非线性门控检索模块的编辑框架，用于高效修改大语言模型中的知识，同时保持其通用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有线性L&E方法在编辑大量事实时可能损害模型通用能力或导致遗忘的问题。

Method: 将线性L&E方法建模为KV数据库查询，并引入非线性的门控检索模块，仅在涉及编辑事实时激活。

Result: 在10,000个事实的编辑实验中，NeuralDB在多个指标上表现优异，且能扩展到100,000个事实。

Conclusion: NeuralDB是一种高效且可扩展的知识编辑框架，能显著提升编辑效果并保持模型性能。

Abstract: Efficiently editing knowledge stored in large language models (LLMs) enables
model updates without large-scale training. One possible solution is
Locate-and-Edit (L\&E), allowing simultaneous modifications of a massive number
of facts. However, such editing may compromise the general abilities of LLMs
and even result in forgetting edited facts when scaling up to thousands of
edits. In this paper, we model existing linear L\&E methods as querying a
Key-Value (KV) database. From this perspective, we then propose NeuralDB, an
editing framework that explicitly represents the edited facts as a neural KV
database equipped with a non-linear gated retrieval module, % In particular,
our gated module only operates when inference involves the edited facts,
effectively preserving the general abilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments
involving the editing of 10,000 facts were conducted on the ZsRE and
CounterFacts datasets, using GPT2-XL, GPT-J (6B) and Llama-3 (8B). The results
demonstrate that NeuralDB not only excels in editing efficacy, generalization,
specificity, fluency, and consistency, but also preserves overall performance
across six representative text understanding and generation tasks. Further
experiments indicate that NeuralDB maintains its effectiveness even when scaled
to 100,000 facts (\textbf{50x} more than in prior work).

*Duy Nguyen,Archiki Prasad,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GrAInS是一种基于梯度归因的推理时引导方法，通过识别关键令牌并构建方向性引导向量，优化语言和视觉语言模型的行为，无需微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定干预向量，忽视输入令牌的因果影响，且未充分利用多模态梯度信息。

Method: 使用对比梯度归因（Integrated Gradients）识别关键令牌，构建方向性引导向量，并在推理时调整隐藏激活。

Result: 在TruthfulQA、MMHal-Bench和SPA-VL等任务上表现优于微调和现有基线方法。

Conclusion: GrAInS提供细粒度、可解释的模型行为控制，同时保持模型的流畅性和通用能力。

Abstract: Inference-time steering methods offer a lightweight alternative to
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) by
modifying internal activations at test time without updating model weights.
However, most existing approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors,
overlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage
informative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal
settings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly. To address these
limitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that
operates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS
uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to
identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively
attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred
outputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors
that capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During
inference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by
token-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve
representational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular
control over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.
Empirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing
steering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using
Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514
with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all
while preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.

TL;DR: 利用大型语言模型（LLM）生成合成短语断点标注，减少人工标注需求，并在多语言中验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前短语断点预测方法依赖大量人工标注，成本高且受语音领域变异性影响，LLM在NLP中成功解决数据问题，启发探索其在语音领域的应用。

Method: 通过LLM生成合成短语断点标注，与传统标注对比，评估其在多语言中的有效性。

Result: LLM生成的合成数据有效缓解短语断点预测的数据挑战，展示其在语音领域的潜力。

Conclusion: LLM为语音领域提供了一种可行的解决方案，减少人工标注需求并提高数据质量。

Abstract: Current approaches to phrase break prediction address crucial prosodic
aspects of text-to-speech systems but heavily rely on vast human annotations
from audio or text, incurring significant manual effort and cost. Inherent
variability in the speech domain, driven by phonetic factors, further
complicates acquiring consistent, high-quality data. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have shown success in addressing data challenges in NLP by
generating tailored synthetic data while reducing manual annotation needs.
Motivated by this, we explore leveraging LLM to generate synthetic phrase break
annotations, addressing the challenges of both manual annotation and
speech-related tasks by comparing with traditional annotations and assessing
effectiveness across multiple languages. Our findings suggest that LLM-based
synthetic data generation effectively mitigates data challenges in phrase break
prediction and highlights the potential of LLMs as a viable solution for the
speech domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM生成合成数据的多样性和隐私风险，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出了一套量化评估指标，并通过实验测试多种先进LLM生成的合成数据。

Result: 实验显示LLM在生成多样且隐私保护的合成数据方面存在显著局限性。

Conclusion: 提出基于提示的方法，旨在提升合成数据的多样性同时保护隐私。

Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data generated by Large Language Models
(LLMs) presents both opportunities and challenges in data-driven applications.
While synthetic data provides a cost-effective, scalable alternative to
real-world data to facilitate model training, its diversity and privacy risks
remain underexplored. Focusing on text-based synthetic data, we propose a
comprehensive set of metrics to quantitatively assess the diversity (i.e.,
linguistic expression, sentiment, and user perspective), and privacy (i.e.,
re-identification risk and stylistic outliers) of synthetic datasets generated
by several state-of-the-art LLMs. Experiment results reveal significant
limitations in LLMs' capabilities in generating diverse and privacy-preserving
synthetic data. Guided by the evaluation results, a prompt-based approach is
proposed to enhance the diversity of synthetic reviews while preserving
reviewer privacy.

with the development of numerous benchmarks for evaluating their performance.
However, most existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating whether SLMs
can perform complex tasks comparable to those tackled by large language models
(LLMs), often failing to align with how users naturally interact in real-world
conversational scenarios. In this paper, we propose TELEVAL, a dynamic
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate SLMs' effectiveness as
conversational agents in realistic Chinese interactive settings. TELEVAL
defines three evaluation dimensions: Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and
Implicit Semantics, and System Abilities. It adopts a dialogue format
consistent with real-world usage and evaluates text and audio outputs
separately. TELEVAL particularly focuses on the model's ability to extract
implicit cues from user speech and respond appropriately without additional
instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that despite recent progress,
existing SLMs still have considerable room for improvement in natural
conversational tasks. We hope that TELEVAL can serve as a user-centered
evaluation framework that directly reflects the user experience and contributes
to the development of more capable dialogue-oriented SLMs.

### [14] [Hybrid and Unitary Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models: Methods and Benchmarking under Resource Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18076)
*Haomin Qi,Zihan Dai,Chengbo Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态结合BOFT正交稳定性和LoRA-GA梯度对齐快速收敛的混合参数高效微调（PEFT）方法，显著提升了收敛效率和泛化能力，同时降低了资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的微调因规模和内存需求成为计算瓶颈，需要更高效的参数微调方法。

Method: 提出混合策略，动态结合BOFT和LoRA-GA的优势，并首次将uRNN原理应用于基于Transformer的LLMs，通过梯度规范和结构化酉约束优化更新。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，混合方法表现优于现有PEFT基线，接近全微调精度，同时减少训练时间和内存使用。

Conclusion: 混合方法为资源受限场景下的LLMs微调提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains a computational bottleneck
due to their scale and memory demands. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, including
LoRA, BOFT, LoRA-GA, and uRNN, and introduces a novel hybrid strategy that
dynamically integrates BOFT's orthogonal stability with LoRA-GA's
gradient-aligned rapid convergence. By computing per-layer adaptive updates
guided by gradient norms, the hybrid method achieves superior convergence
efficiency and generalization across diverse tasks. We also explore, for the
first time, the adaptation of unitary RNN (uRNN) principles to
transformer-based LLMs, enhancing gradient stability through structured unitary
constraints. Empirical evaluations on four benchmarks -- GLUE, GSM8K, MT-Bench,
and HumanEval -- using models ranging from 7B to 405B parameters demonstrate
that our hybrid method consistently outperforms individual PEFT baselines,
approaching full fine-tuning accuracy while reducing resource consumption by up
to 2.1 times in training time and 50 percent in memory usage. These findings
establish the hybrid approach as a practical and scalable fine-tuning solution
for real-world deployment of LLMs under resource constraints.

TL;DR: 2024年新版GloVe模型报告，更新了2014年模型，改进了文档和性能，适用于现代语言和文化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2014年GloVe模型虽广泛使用，但语言和世界在变化，需更新模型。原模型文档不足，新版解决了这一问题。

Method: 使用Wikipedia、Gigaword和Dolma子集训练两组词嵌入。通过词汇比较、直接测试和NER任务评估。

Result: 2024年模型包含新文化词汇，结构任务表现相当，在非西方新闻数据NER任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 新版GloVe模型更适应当代语言需求，文档完善，性能提升。

Abstract: This report documents, describes, and evaluates new 2024 English GloVe
(Global Vectors for Word Representation) models. While the original GloVe
models built in 2014 have been widely used and found useful, languages and the
world continue to evolve and we thought that current usage could benefit from
updated models. Moreover, the 2014 models were not carefully documented as to
the exact data versions and preprocessing that were used, and we rectify this
by documenting these new models. We trained two sets of word embeddings using
Wikipedia, Gigaword, and a subset of Dolma. Evaluation through vocabulary
comparison, direct testing, and NER tasks shows that the 2024 vectors
incorporate new culturally and linguistically relevant words, perform
comparably on structural tasks like analogy and similarity, and demonstrate
improved performance on recent, temporally dependent NER datasets such as
non-Western newswire data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GOAT-SLM是一个新型的端到端口语语言模型，专注于捕捉语音中的副语言和说话者特征，通过双模态头架构和分阶段训练策略，实现了语义和非语义任务的高效平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有口语语言模型主要关注文本语义，忽略了语音中的副语言和说话者特征（如方言、年龄、情感等），限制了模型的自然交互能力。

Method: 采用双模态头架构分离语言建模和声学实现，提出模块化分阶段训练策略，逐步对齐语言、副语言和说话者特征信息。

Result: 在TELEVAL基准测试中，GOAT-SLM在语义和非语义任务上表现均衡，尤其在情感、方言和年龄敏感交互任务上优于现有开源模型。

Conclusion: GOAT-SLM强调了超越语言内容建模的重要性，推动了更自然、自适应且具有社会意识的语音系统的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have
significantly improved the ability of AI systems to engage in natural spoken
interactions. However, most existing models treat speech merely as a vehicle
for linguistic content, often overlooking the rich paralinguistic and speaker
characteristic cues embedded in human speech, such as dialect, age, emotion,
and non-speech vocalizations. In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel
spoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness,
designed to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics. GOAT-SLM
adopts a dual-modality head architecture that decouples linguistic modeling
from acoustic realization, enabling robust language understanding while
supporting expressive and adaptive speech generation. To enhance model
efficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that
progressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic
information using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on
TELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM
achieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks,
and outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal
variation, and age-sensitive interactions. This work highlights the importance
of modeling beyond linguistic content and advances the development of more
natural, adaptive, and socially aware spoken language systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文评估了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在基于代码的多模态数学推理中的能力，重点关注代码生成和编辑任务，发现现有模型在细粒度视觉操作上仍远落后于人类表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注纯文本推理输出，而MLLMs通过代码执行准确视觉操作的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出一个评估框架，包括多模态代码生成（MCG）和多模态代码编辑（MCE）任务，使用涵盖五种数学图形的数据集，测试九种主流MLLMs。

Result: 实验结果显示，现有模型在细粒度视觉操作上表现显著低于人类水平。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了MLLMs在代码驱动多模态数学推理评估上的空白，并揭示了模型在此领域的局限性。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled
step-by-step multi-modal mathematical reasoning by performing visual operations
based on the textual instructions. A promising approach uses code as an
intermediate representation to precisely express and manipulate the images in
the reasoning steps. However, existing evaluations focus mainly on text-only
reasoning outputs, leaving the MLLM's ability to perform accurate visual
operations via code largely unexplored. This work takes a first step toward
addressing that gap by evaluating MLLM's code-based capabilities in multi-modal
mathematical reasoning.Specifically, our framework focuses on two key
evaluation aspects: (1) Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG) evaluates the model's
ability to accurately understand and construct visualizations from scratch. (2)
Multi-modal Code Editing (MCE) assesses the model's capacity for fine-grained
operations, which include three types: Deletion, Modification and Annotation.
To evaluate the above tasks, we incorporate a dataset that covers the five most
popular types of mathematical figures, including geometric diagrams, function
plots, and three types of statistical charts, to provide a comprehensive and
effective measurement of existing MLLMs. Our experimental evaluation involves
nine mainstream MLLMs, and the results reveal that existing models still lag
significantly behind human performance in performing fine-grained visual
operations.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在HIV管理中的能力，开发了HIVMedQA基准测试，发现Gemini 2.5 Pro表现最佳，但复杂问题下性能下降，且模型大小并非性能的可靠指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HIV管理的复杂性使其成为LLMs应用的理想场景，但临床实践中对准确性、潜在危害和接受度的担忧尚未充分研究。

Method: 研究开发了HIVMedQA基准测试，评估了7个通用和3个医学专用LLMs，结合了词汇相似性和LLM作为评判的方法。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro表现最佳，但复杂问题性能下降，医学微调模型不一定优于通用模型，推理和理解比事实回忆更具挑战性。

Conclusion: 需针对性开发和评估以确保LLMs在临床中的安全有效应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as valuable tools to support
clinicians in routine decision-making. HIV management is a compelling use case
due to its complexity, including diverse treatment options, comorbidities, and
adherence challenges. However, integrating LLMs into clinical practice raises
concerns about accuracy, potential harm, and clinician acceptance. Despite
their promise, AI applications in HIV care remain underexplored, and LLM
benchmarking studies are scarce. This study evaluates the current capabilities
of LLMs in HIV management, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We
introduce HIVMedQA, a benchmark designed to assess open-ended medical question
answering in HIV care. The dataset consists of curated, clinically relevant
questions developed with input from an infectious disease physician. We
evaluated seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs, applying
prompt engineering to enhance performance. Our evaluation framework
incorporates both lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach, extended
to better reflect clinical relevance. We assessed performance across key
dimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias,
potential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro
consistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of
the top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question
complexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform
general-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of
performance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual
recall, and cognitive biases such as recency and status quo were observed.
These findings underscore the need for targeted development and evaluation to
ensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care.

*Kexin Chen,Dongxia Wang,Yi Liu,Haonan Zhang,Wenhai Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Transformer文本嵌入模型中存在'粘性标记'问题，这些标记会破坏嵌入的可靠性。本文提出了一种检测方法STD，并分析了其对下游任务的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer模型中异常标记（粘性标记）对嵌入可靠性和下游任务性能的影响。

Method: 提出Sticky Token Detector (STD)方法，通过句子和标记过滤检测粘性标记，并在40个模型检查点中验证。

Result: 发现868个粘性标记，主要源于特殊词汇或未使用的子词。这些标记显著降低下游任务性能（高达50%）。

Conclusion: 需改进标记化和模型设计以减少粘性标记的影响。

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of Transformer-based text embedding models in NLP
tasks, surprising 'sticky tokens' can undermine the reliability of embeddings.
These tokens, when repeatedly inserted into sentences, pull sentence similarity
toward a certain value, disrupting the normal distribution of embedding
distances and degrading downstream performance. In this paper, we
systematically investigate such anomalous tokens, formally defining them and
introducing an efficient detection method, Sticky Token Detector (STD), based
on sentence and token filtering. Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model
families, we discover a total of 868 sticky tokens. Our analysis reveals that
these tokens often originate from special or unused entries in the vocabulary,
as well as fragmented subwords from multilingual corpora. Notably, their
presence does not strictly correlate with model size or vocabulary size. We
further evaluate how sticky tokens affect downstream tasks like clustering and
retrieval, observing significant performance drops of up to 50%. Through
attention-layer analysis, we show that sticky tokens disproportionately
dominate the model's internal representations, raising concerns about
tokenization robustness. Our findings show the need for better tokenization
strategies and model design to mitigate the impact of sticky tokens in future
text embedding applications.

TL;DR: SCOPE框架通过消除选项位置和标签的偏见，提升大语言模型在选择题任务中的公平性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型可能通过利用选项位置或标签的偏见而非真正理解任务来获得高分，导致评估不准确。

Method: SCOPE通过无语义内容的空提示估计模型的偏见分布，并重新分配答案位置以消除偏见，同时避免语义相似的干扰项相邻。

Result: 在多个基准实验中，SCOPE在稳定性能提升和更清晰的置信度分布上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SCOPE为提升大语言模型评估的公平性和可靠性提供了新标准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve inflated scores on multiple-choice
tasks by exploiting inherent biases in option positions or labels, rather than
demonstrating genuine understanding. This study introduces SCOPE, an evaluation
framework designed to measure and mitigate such selection bias in a
dataset-independent manner. By repeatedly invoking a null prompt that lacks
semantic content, SCOPE estimates each model's unique position-bias
distribution. It then redistributes the answer slot according to the
inverse-bias distribution, thereby equalizing the lucky-rate, the probability
of selecting the correct answer by chance. Furthermore, it prevents
semantically similar distractors from being placed adjacent to the answer,
thereby blocking near-miss guesses based on superficial proximity cues. Across
multiple benchmark experiments, SCOPE consistently outperformed existing
debiasing methods in terms of stable performance improvements and showed
clearer confidence distributions over correct options. This framework thus
offers a new standard for enhancing the fairness and reliability of LLM
evaluations.

Conclusion: 通过SECI模型和PDCA循环，可以有效实现ISO30401兼容的知识管理系统与现有业务流程的整合。

Abstract: Business process modeling is used by most organizations as an essential
framework for ensuring efficiency and effectiveness of the work and workflow
performed by its employees and for ensuring the alignment of such work with its
strategic goals. For organizations that are compliant or near-compliant with
ISO 9001, this approach involves the detailed mapping of processes,
sub-processes, activities, and tasks. ISO30401 is a Management System Standard,
introduced in 2018, establishing universal requirements for the set up of a
Knowledge Management System in an organization. As ``ISO30401 implementers'' we
regularly face the challenge of explaining our clients how the knowledge
development, transformation and conveyances activities depicted in ISO30401 do
integrate with existing operational processes. This article recaps process
modelling principles in the context of ISO9001 and explores, based on our
experience, how an ISO30401-compliant Knowledge Management System (KMS)
entwines with all other processes of an Integrated Management System and in
particular how it can be implemented by deploying the mechanisms of the SECI

<details>

Motivation: RAG依赖外部知识库可能导致安全风险，攻击者可通过注入有毒文档操控生成结果，因此需要一种高效的防御机制。

Method: GMTP通过分析检索器相似度函数的梯度识别关键令牌，掩码后检查其概率，低概率令牌标记为恶意。

Result: 实验表明GMTP能过滤90%以上的有毒内容，同时保留相关文档，确保检索和生成的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GMTP是一种高效且精确的防御方法，适用于RAG系统以抵御文档注入攻击。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
providing external knowledge for accurate and up-to-date responses. However,
this reliance on external sources exposes a security risk, attackers can inject
poisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process
toward harmful or misleading outputs. In this paper, we propose Gradient-based
Masked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter
out adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact
tokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function. These key
tokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked
Language Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low
masked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious
documents and achieve high-precision filtering. Experiments demonstrate that
GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant
documents, thus maintaining robust retrieval and generation performance across
diverse datasets and adversarial settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 指令调优提升了大语言模型（LLM）遵循用户指令的能力，但也增加了其对用户输入的依赖，导致更容易接受错误信息。研究发现指令调优显著提高了LLM对错误信息的接受度，并探讨了其他影响因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究指令调优对LLM接受错误信息的影响，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 通过对比指令调优模型和基础模型，分析其对用户提供信息的依赖程度，并探讨提示结构、错误信息长度和系统提示警告等因素的影响。

Result: 指令调优的LLM更容易接受用户提供的错误信息，且依赖程度更高。

Conclusion: 需系统性方法减少指令调优的负面影响，提升LLM在实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Instruction-tuning enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
follow user instructions more accurately, improving usability while reducing
harmful outputs. However, this process may increase the model's dependence on
user input, potentially leading to the unfiltered acceptance of misinformation
and the generation of hallucinations. Existing studies primarily highlight that
LLMs are receptive to external information that contradict their parametric
knowledge, but little research has been conducted on the direct impact of
instruction-tuning on this phenomenon. In our study, we investigate the impact
of instruction-tuning on LLM's susceptibility to misinformation. Our analysis
reveals that instruction-tuned LLMs are significantly more likely to accept
misinformation when it is presented by the user. A comparison with base models
shows that instruction-tuning increases reliance on user-provided information,
shifting susceptibility from the assistant role to the user role. Furthermore,
we explore additional factors influencing misinformation susceptibility, such
as the role of the user in prompt structure, misinformation length, and the
presence of warnings in the system prompt. Our findings underscore the need for
systematic approaches to mitigate unintended consequences of instruction-tuning
and enhance the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决层剪枝导致的隐藏状态幅度差距和性能下降问题。

Method: 估计剪枝后的幅度差距，通过离线重新缩放权重补偿差距，无需运行时开销。

Result: 剪枝5层LLaMA-3-8B后，困惑度减半，保留93.19%的问答性能，优于基线4.01%。

Conclusion: Prune&Comp有效提升层剪枝性能，是一种高效且无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a promising technique for compressing large
language models (LLMs) while achieving acceleration proportional to the pruning
ratio. In this work, we identify that removing any layer induces a significant
magnitude gap in hidden states, resulting in substantial performance
degradation. To address this issue, we propose Prune&Comp, a novel
plug-and-play layer pruning scheme that leverages magnitude compensation to
mitigate such gaps in a training-free manner. Specifically, we first estimate
the magnitude gap caused by layer removal and then eliminate this gap by
rescaling the remaining weights offline, with zero runtime overhead incurred.
We further demonstrate the advantages of Prune&Comp through an iterative
pruning strategy. When integrated with an iterative prune-and-compensate loop,
Prune&Comp consistently enhances existing layer pruning metrics. For instance,
when 5 layers of LLaMA-3-8B are pruned using the prevalent block influence
metric, Prune&Comp nearly halves the perplexity and retains 93.19\% of the
original model's question-answering performance, outperforming the baseline by
4.01%.

Method: 提出Locate-and-Focus方法，先定位术语片段以构建翻译知识，再通过音频和文本模态关联知识，帮助模型聚焦翻译。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效定位术语并提升翻译成功率，同时保持整体翻译性能。

Conclusion: Locate-and-Focus方法显著改善了术语翻译效果，为直接语音翻译提供了新思路。

Abstract: Direct speech translation (ST) has garnered increasing attention nowadays,
yet the accurate translation of terminology within utterances remains a great
challenge. In this regard, current studies mainly concentrate on leveraging
various translation knowledge into ST models. However, these methods often
struggle with interference from irrelevant noise and can not fully utilize the
translation knowledge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a
novel Locate-and-Focus method for terminology translation. It first effectively
locates the speech clips containing terminologies within the utterance to
construct translation knowledge, minimizing irrelevant information for the ST
model. Subsequently, it associates the translation knowledge with the utterance
and hypothesis from both audio and textual modalities, allowing the ST model to
better focus on translation knowledge during translation. Experimental results
across various datasets demonstrate that our method effectively locates
terminologies within utterances and enhances the success rate of terminology
translation, while maintaining robust general translation performance.

Motivation: 解决低资源语言（LRL）使用独特脚本时的OCR问题，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 比较六种OCR引擎（包括商业和开源系统）在Sinhala和Tamil上的性能，使用五种测量技术评估字符和单词级别的准确性。

Result: Surya在Sinhala上表现最佳（WER 2.61%），Document AI在Tamil上表现最优（CER 0.78%）。

Conclusion: 研究为低资源语言的OCR性能提供了基准，并引入了一个新的合成Tamil OCR数据集。

Abstract: Solving the problem of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on printed text
for Latin and its derivative scripts can now be considered settled due to the
volumes of research done on English and other High-Resourced Languages (HRL).
However, for Low-Resourced Languages (LRL) that use unique scripts, it remains
an open problem. This study presents a comparative analysis of the zero-shot
performance of six distinct OCR engines on two LRLs: Sinhala and Tamil. The
selected engines include both commercial and open-source systems, aiming to
evaluate the strengths of each category. The Cloud Vision API, Surya, Document
AI, and Tesseract were evaluated for both Sinhala and Tamil, while Subasa OCR
and EasyOCR were examined for only one language due to their limitations. The
performance of these systems was rigorously analysed using five measurement
techniques to assess accuracy at both the character and word levels. According
to the findings, Surya delivered the best performance for Sinhala across all
metrics, with a WER of 2.61%. Conversely, Document AI excelled across all
metrics for Tamil, highlighted by a very low CER of 0.78%. In addition to the
above analysis, we also introduce a novel synthetic Tamil OCR benchmarking
dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业通信中需要适应特定风格（如品牌声音或作者语调），但缺乏指令-响应格式的语料库难以实现风格迁移且不影响指令遵循。

Method: 使用LoRA适配器在基础模型上训练多样化的非结构化风格语料库，然后将其与指令跟随模型合并。

Result: 实验显示风格一致性提升且指令遵循不受影响，人类评估确认品牌特定惯例的采纳。

Conclusion: StyleAdaptedLM为LLM的风格个性化提供了高效路径。

Abstract: Adapting LLMs to specific stylistic characteristics, like brand voice or
authorial tones, is crucial for enterprise communication but challenging to
achieve from corpora which lacks instruction-response formatting without
compromising instruction adherence. We introduce StyleAdaptedLM, a framework
that efficiently transfers stylistic traits to instruction-following models
using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). LoRA adapters are first trained on a base
model with diverse unstructured stylistic corpora, then merged with a separate
instruction-following model. This enables robust stylistic customization
without paired data or sacrificing task performance. Experiments across
multiple datasets and models demonstrate improved stylistic consistency while
preserving instruction adherence, with human evaluations confirming
brand-specific convention uptake. StyleAdaptedLM offers an efficient path for
stylistic personalization in LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对大型推理模型（LRMs）的新型攻击方法，称为“过度思考后门”，通过数据污染实现可控的推理冗长度攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现LRMs在复杂推理任务中的潜在安全漏洞，提出一种新型攻击向量以控制模型的推理冗长度。

Method: 采用数据污染方法，通过可调触发器（重复次数表示强度）和程序化生成的冗长推理响应（由教师LLM注入冗余步骤）实现攻击。

Result: 实验证明该方法能可靠触发可控的多倍推理过程延长，且不影响最终答案的正确性。

Conclusion: 该攻击方法作为一种纯资源消耗向量，具有隐蔽性，为LRMs的安全性研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have emerged as a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, representing a specialized class of large language
models (LLMs) designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks. The defining
characteristic of LRMs lies in their extensive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector
against LRMs, which we term "overthinking backdoors". We advance this concept
by proposing a novel tunable backdoor, which moves beyond simple on/off attacks
to one where an attacker can precisely control the extent of the model's
reasoning verbosity. Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning
methodology. It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals
the desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response. These
responses are programmatically generated by instructing a teacher LLM to inject
a controlled number of redundant refinement steps into a correct reasoning
process. The approach preserves output correctness, which ensures stealth and
establishes the attack as a pure resource-consumption vector. Extensive
empirical results on various LRMs demonstrate that our method can reliably
trigger a controllable, multi-fold increase in the length of the reasoning
process, without degrading the final answer's correctness. Our source code is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了机器翻译中性别标记不明确的源句翻译问题，发现模型在性别模糊时未能表现出足够的不确定性，且去偏方法对模糊和明确实例的影响不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决机器翻译中性别标记不明确时的翻译偏差问题，尤其是在模型依赖刻板印象而非上下文信息的情况下。

Method: 方法包括使用语义不确定性指标评估模型在性别模糊时的表现，并分析去偏方法对翻译实例的影响。

Result: 结果显示，翻译和性别准确性高的模型在性别模糊时未能表现出足够的不确定性，且去偏方法对模糊和明确实例的效果不同。

Conclusion: 结论是模型在性别模糊时应保持不确定性，且去偏方法需针对不同实例进行优化。

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), when the source sentence includes a lexeme whose
gender is not overtly marked, but whose target-language equivalent requires
gender specification, the model must infer the appropriate gender from the
context and/or external knowledge. Studies have shown that MT models exhibit
biased behaviour, relying on stereotypes even when they clash with contextual
information. We posit that apart from confidently translating using the correct
gender when it is evident from the input, models should also maintain
uncertainty about the gender when it is ambiguous. Using recently proposed
metrics of semantic uncertainty, we find that models with high translation and
gender accuracy on unambiguous instances do not necessarily exhibit the
expected level of uncertainty in ambiguous ones. Similarly, debiasing has
independent effects on ambiguous and unambiguous translation instances.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TDR的新框架，通过解耦多任务数据集中的示例并利用LLM的细粒度反馈来提升ICL中示例检索的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ICL中示例检索的两个主要挑战：跨任务数据分布难以区分，以及检索器输出与LLM反馈之间的细粒度连接困难。

Method: TDR框架解耦多任务数据集中的示例，并利用LLM的细粒度反馈来监督检索模块的训练。

Result: 在30个NLP任务上的实验表明，TDR在所有数据集上均提升了性能，并达到了最先进的水平。

Conclusion: TDR是一种即插即用的方法，可轻松与各种LLM结合，提升ICL的示例检索能力。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has become a classic approach for enabling LLMs to
handle various tasks based on a few input-output examples. The effectiveness of
ICL heavily relies on the quality of these examples, and previous works which
focused on enhancing example retrieval capabilities have achieved impressive
performances. However, two challenges remain in retrieving high-quality
examples: (1) Difficulty in distinguishing cross-task data distributions, (2)
Difficulty in making the fine-grained connection between retriever output and
feedback from LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called TDR. TDR
decouples the ICL examples from different tasks, which enables the retrieval
module to retrieve examples specific to the target task within a multi-task
dataset. Furthermore, TDR models fine-grained feedback from LLMs to supervise
and guide the training of the retrieval module, which helps to retrieve
high-quality examples. We conducted extensive experiments on a suite of 30 NLP
tasks, the results demonstrate that TDR consistently improved results across
all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Meanwhile, our approach
is a plug-and-play method, which can be easily combined with various LLMs to
improve example retrieval abilities for ICL. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合人类专家和大型语言模型（LLM）的新框架，以提高社交媒体上宣传检测的标注一致性和可扩展性。通过分层分类法和LLM辅助预标注流程，显著提升了标注效率和小模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的宣传检测因任务复杂性和高质量标注数据有限而具有挑战性，需要一种既能保证一致性又能扩展的解决方案。

Method: 提出分层分类法组织14种细粒度宣传技术，通过LLM辅助预标注流程提取宣传片段并生成解释，再通过知识蒸馏训练小模型。

Result: LLM辅助预标注显著提高了人类标注的一致性和效率，小模型通过LLM生成的高质量数据表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架为开发可扩展且鲁棒的宣传检测系统提供了支持，符合SDG 16的目标，代码已开源。

Abstract: Propaganda detection on social media remains challenging due to task
complexity and limited high-quality labeled data. This paper introduces a novel
framework that combines human expertise with Large Language Model (LLM)
assistance to improve both annotation consistency and scalability. We propose a
hierarchical taxonomy that organizes 14 fine-grained propaganda techniques into
three broader categories, conduct a human annotation study on the HQP dataset
that reveals low inter-annotator agreement for fine-grained labels, and
implement an LLM-assisted pre-annotation pipeline that extracts propagandistic
spans, generates concise explanations, and assigns local labels as well as a
global label. A secondary human verification study shows significant
improvements in both agreement and time-efficiency. Building on this, we
fine-tune smaller language models (SLMs) to perform structured annotation.
Instead of fine-tuning on human annotations, we train on high-quality
LLM-generated data, allowing a large model to produce these annotations and a
smaller model to learn to generate them via knowledge distillation. Our work
contributes towards the development of scalable and robust propaganda detection
systems, supporting the idea of transparent and accountable media ecosystems in
line with SDG 16. The code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

TL;DR: CLEAR是一个交互式开源工具，用于分析LLM的错误，提供详细反馈和可视化分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估方法仅提供单一评分或排名，缺乏具体性能原因的分析。

Method: CLEAR生成实例级反馈，识别系统级错误，并提供交互式仪表盘进行深入分析。

Result: CLEAR在RAG和数学基准测试中展示了其分析能力，并通过用户案例验证了其实用性。

Conclusion: CLEAR填补了LLM评估中缺乏具体错误分析的空白，提供了更全面的性能诊断工具。

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly relies on other
LLMs acting as judges. However, current evaluation paradigms typically yield a
single score or ranking, answering which model is better but not why. While
essential for benchmarking, these top-level scores obscure the specific,
actionable reasons behind a model's performance. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CLEAR, an interactive, open-source package for LLM-based error
analysis. CLEAR first generates per-instance textual feedback, then it creates
a set of system-level error issues, and quantifies the prevalence of each
identified issue. Our package also provides users with an interactive dashboard
that allows for a comprehensive error analysis through aggregate
visualizations, applies interactive filters to isolate specific issues or score
ranges, and drills down to the individual instances that exemplify a particular
behavioral pattern. We demonstrate CLEAR analysis for RAG and Math benchmarks,
and showcase its utility through a user case study.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 维基百科多语言版本内容独立编写和更新，导致事实不一致，影响其可靠性和AI系统的训练数据质量。

Method: 开发了一种方法，收集、对齐和分析多语言文章中的表格数据，定义不一致类别，并应用定量和定性指标评估对齐情况。

Result: 通过样本数据集评估了多语言对齐情况，揭示了不一致的类型和程度。

Conclusion: 研究结果对事实验证、多语言知识交互以及依赖维基百科内容的可靠AI系统设计具有重要意义。

Abstract: Wikipedia serves as a globally accessible knowledge source with content in
over 300 languages. Despite covering the same topics, the different versions of
Wikipedia are written and updated independently. This leads to factual
inconsistencies that can impact the neutrality and reliability of the
encyclopedia and AI systems, which often rely on Wikipedia as a main training
source. This study investigates cross-lingual inconsistencies in Wikipedia's
structured content, with a focus on tabular data. We developed a methodology to
collect, align, and analyze tables from Wikipedia multilingual articles,
defining categories of inconsistency. We apply various quantitative and
qualitative metrics to assess multilingual alignment using a sample dataset.
These insights have implications for factual verification, multilingual
knowledge interaction, and design for reliable AI systems leveraging Wikipedia
content.

TL;DR: FinDPO是一种基于直接偏好优化（DPO）的金融领域特定LLM框架，显著提升了情感分析性能，并在实际投资策略中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线金融文本情感分析对交易决策和市场动态影响日益显著，但现有监督微调（SFT）方法存在泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 提出FinDPO框架，通过DPO进行后训练人类偏好对齐，并引入‘logit-to-score’转换生成连续情感分数。

Result: FinDPO在情感分类基准上平均提升11%，模拟投资策略年回报率达67%，夏普比率为2.0。

Conclusion: FinDPO是首个在金融领域实现高性能情感分析并实际应用于投资策略的框架。

Abstract: Opinions expressed in online finance-related textual data are having an
increasingly profound impact on trading decisions and market movements. This
trend highlights the vital role of sentiment analysis as a tool for quantifying
the nature and strength of such opinions. With the rapid development of
Generative AI (GenAI), supervised fine-tuned (SFT) large language models (LLMs)
have become the de facto standard for financial sentiment analysis. However,
the SFT paradigm can lead to memorization of the training data and often fails
to generalize to unseen samples. This is a critical limitation in financial
domains, where models must adapt to previously unobserved events and the
nuanced, domain-specific language of finance. To this end, we introduce FinDPO,
the first finance-specific LLM framework based on post-training human
preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The proposed
FinDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard sentiment
classification benchmarks, outperforming existing supervised fine-tuned models
by 11% on the average. Uniquely, the FinDPO framework enables the integration
of a fine-tuned causal LLM into realistic portfolio strategies through a novel
'logit-to-score' conversion, which transforms discrete sentiment predictions
into continuous, rankable sentiment scores (probabilities). In this way,
simulations demonstrate that FinDPO is the first sentiment-based approach to
maintain substantial positive returns of 67% annually and strong risk-adjusted
performance, as indicated by a Sharpe ratio of 2.0, even under realistic
transaction costs of 5 basis points (bps).

TL;DR: 论文介绍了AraTable，一个用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）在阿拉伯语表格数据上推理和理解能力的综合基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决阿拉伯语表格数据在LLMs中评估资源不足的问题。

Method: 采用混合方法，由LLMs生成初始内容，再由人类专家过滤和验证。

Result: LLMs在简单任务（如直接问答）表现尚可，但在复杂推理和事实验证任务中仍有挑战。

Conclusion: AraTable为阿拉伯语结构化数据的处理提供了公开资源和评估框架，有助于未来研究。

Abstract: The cognitive and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have
enabled remarkable progress in natural language processing. However, their
performance in interpreting structured data, especially in tabular formats,
remains limited. Although benchmarks for English tabular data are widely
available, Arabic is still underrepresented because of the limited availability
of public resources and its unique language features. To address this gap, we
present AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular
data. AraTable consists of various evaluation tasks, such as direct question
answering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, involving a wide range of
Arabic tabular sources. Our methodology follows a hybrid pipeline, where
initial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by
human experts to ensure high dataset quality. Initial analyses using AraTable
show that, while LLMs perform adequately on simpler tabular tasks such as
direct question answering, they continue to face significant cognitive
challenges when tasks require deeper reasoning and fact verification. This
indicates that there are substantial opportunities for future work to improve
performance on complex tabular reasoning tasks. We also propose a fully
automated evaluation framework that uses a self-deliberation mechanism and
achieves performance nearly identical to that of human judges. This research
provides a valuable, publicly available resource and evaluation framework that
can help accelerate the development of foundational models for processing and
analysing Arabic structured data.

Result: 模型在新闻测试集上准确率达97.1%，参考集和ASR集分别达到91.2%和90.2%，表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为孟加拉语标点恢复建立了强基线，并公开了数据集和代码，支持低资源NLP的未来研究。

Abstract: Punctuation restoration enhances the readability of text and is critical for
post-processing tasks in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), especially for
low-resource languages like Bangla. In this study, we explore the application
of transformer-based models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa-large, to automatically
restore punctuation in unpunctuated Bangla text. We focus on predicting four
punctuation marks: period, comma, question mark, and exclamation mark across
diverse text domains. To address the scarcity of annotated resources, we
constructed a large, varied training corpus and applied data augmentation
techniques. Our best-performing model, trained with an augmentation factor of
alpha = 0.20%, achieves an accuracy of 97.1% on the News test set, 91.2% on the
Reference set, and 90.2% on the ASR set.
  Results show strong generalization to reference and ASR transcripts,
demonstrating the model's effectiveness in real-world, noisy scenarios. This
work establishes a strong baseline for Bangla punctuation restoration and
contributes publicly available datasets and code to support future research in
low-resource NLP.

Conclusion: 合成医学文本有助于解决数据稀疏问题，但需进一步解决隐私和评估问题。

Abstract: Generating clinical synthetic text represents an effective solution for
common clinical NLP issues like sparsity and privacy. This paper aims to
conduct a systematic review on generating synthetic medical free-text by
formulating quantitative analysis to three research questions concerning (i)
the purpose of generation, (ii) the techniques, and (iii) the evaluation
methods. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE,
Google Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating
synthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant
articles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given
to the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main
purpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing,
corpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer
architectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text,
especially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of
evaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where
utility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic
medical text. Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a
moderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream
NLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the
real documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming
sparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind
generating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to
check for the existence of any sensitive information. Despite that, advances in
generating synthetic medical text will considerably accelerate the adoption of
workflows and pipeline development, discarding the time-consuming legalities of
data transfer.

Motivation: 表格数据的稀疏特征依赖与LLM的自注意力机制不匹配，导致关键关系被稀释。

Method: GraDe通过轻量级动态图学习模块，整合外部提取的功能依赖，优化注意力分配。

Result: 在复杂数据集上性能提升12%，在合成数据质量上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: GraDe为LLM的表格数据建模提供了高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for tabular data
generation by modeling textualized feature-value pairs. However, tabular data
inherently exhibits sparse feature-level dependencies, where many feature
interactions are structurally insignificant. This creates a fundamental
mismatch as LLMs' self-attention mechanism inevitably distributes focus across
all pairs, diluting attention on critical relationships, particularly in
datasets with complex dependencies or semantically ambiguous features. To
address this limitation, we propose GraDe (Graph-Guided Dependency Learning), a
novel method that explicitly integrates sparse dependency graphs into LLMs'
attention mechanism. GraDe employs a lightweight dynamic graph learning module
guided by externally extracted functional dependencies, prioritizing key
feature interactions while suppressing irrelevant ones. Our experiments across
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that GraDe outperforms existing
LLM-based approaches by up to 12% on complex datasets while achieving
competitive results with state-of-the-art approaches in synthetic data quality.
Our method is minimally intrusive yet effective, offering a practical solution
for structure-aware tabular data modeling with LLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) has demonstrated the significant help of
visual information in machine translation. However, existing MMT methods face
challenges in leveraging the modality gap by enforcing rigid visual-linguistic
alignment whilst being confined to inference within their trained multimodal
domains. In this work, we construct novel multimodal scene graphs to preserve
and integrate modality-specific information and introduce GIIFT, a two-stage
Graph-guided Inductive Image-Free MMT framework that uses a cross-modal Graph
Attention Network adapter to learn multimodal knowledge in a unified fused
space and inductively generalize it to broader image-free translation domains.
Experimental results on the Multi30K dataset of English-to-French and
English-to-German tasks demonstrate that our GIIFT surpasses existing
approaches and achieves the state-of-the-art, even without images during
inference. Results on the WMT benchmark show significant improvements over the
image-free translation baselines, demonstrating the strength of GIIFT towards
inductive image-free inference.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合6-mer和BPE-600的混合分词策略，显著提升了DNA语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统k-mer分词在捕捉DNA局部结构时存在分布不均和全局上下文理解不足的问题。

Method: 将6-mer分词与600次BPE循环生成的BPE分词结合，形成平衡且上下文感知的词汇表。

Result: 模型在3-mer、4-mer和5-mer预测任务中分别达到10.78%、10.1%和4.12%的准确率，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 混合分词策略能同时捕捉DNA的局部和全局信息，为基因组语言建模和下游研究奠定基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid tokenization strategy that enhances the
performance of DNA Language Models (DLMs) by combining 6-mer tokenization with
Byte Pair Encoding (BPE-600). Traditional k-mer tokenization is effective at
capturing local DNA sequence structures but often faces challenges, including
uneven token distribution and a limited understanding of global sequence
context. To address these limitations, we propose merging unique 6mer tokens
with optimally selected BPE tokens generated through 600 BPE cycles. This
hybrid approach ensures a balanced and context-aware vocabulary, enabling the
model to capture both short and long patterns within DNA sequences
simultaneously. A foundational DLM trained on this hybrid vocabulary was
evaluated using next-k-mer prediction as a fine-tuning task, demonstrating
significantly improved performance. The model achieved prediction accuracies of
10.78% for 3-mers, 10.1% for 4-mers, and 4.12% for 5-mers, outperforming
state-of-the-art models such as NT, DNABERT2, and GROVER. These results
highlight the ability of the hybrid tokenization strategy to preserve both the
local sequence structure and global contextual information in DNA modeling.
This work underscores the importance of advanced tokenization methods in
genomic language modeling and lays a robust foundation for future applications
in downstream DNA sequence analysis and biological research.

*Feng Hong,Geng Yu,Yushi Ye,Haicheng Huang,Huangjie Zheng,Ya Zhang,Yanfeng Wang,Jiangchao Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为WINO的解码算法，解决了DLLMs在快速并行生成中的质量与速度权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DLLMs在并行解码时存在质量与速度的严重权衡，标准解码的不可逆性导致早期错误积累。

Method: WINO采用并行草稿-验证机制，通过双向上下文验证并重新掩码可疑标记以优化解码。

Result: 在GSM8K和Flickr30K等任务中，WINO显著提升速度（6-10倍）并提高准确性（2.58%）。

Conclusion: WINO是一种无需训练的解码算法，有效改善了DLLMs的质量与速度权衡。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a compelling
alternative to Autoregressive models, designed for fast parallel generation.
However, existing DLLMs are plagued by a severe quality-speed trade-off, where
faster parallel decoding leads to significant performance degradation. We
attribute this to the irreversibility of standard decoding in DLLMs, which is
easily polarized into the wrong decoding direction along with early error
context accumulation. To resolve this, we introduce Wide-In, Narrow-Out (WINO),
a training-free decoding algorithm that enables revokable decoding in DLLMs.
WINO employs a parallel draft-and-verify mechanism, aggressively drafting
multiple tokens while simultaneously using the model's bidirectional context to
verify and re-mask suspicious ones for refinement. Verified in open-source
DLLMs like LLaDA and MMaDA, WINO is shown to decisively improve the
quality-speed trade-off. For instance, on the GSM8K math benchmark, it
accelerates inference by 6$\times$ while improving accuracy by 2.58%; on
Flickr30K captioning, it achieves a 10$\times$ speedup with higher performance.
More comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority and
provide an in-depth understanding of WINO.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for CCL25-Eval Task 10, addressing
Fine-Grained Chinese Hate Speech Recognition (FGCHSR). We propose a novel
SRAG-MAV framework that synergistically integrates task reformulation(TR),
Self-Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SRAG), and Multi-Round Accumulative Voting

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在专业领域表现不佳的问题，同时降低数据合成的高成本和性能限制。

Method: 提出AQuilt框架，结合答案、问题、无标签数据、检查、逻辑和任务类型，生成高质量指令调优数据。

Result: 构建了703k样本的数据集，性能媲美DeepSeek-V3，成本更低，生成数据与下游任务相关性更高。

Conclusion: AQuilt为专业领域提供了一种高效、低成本的数据合成方法，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) in general
domains, they often underperform in specialized domains. Existing approaches
typically rely on data synthesis methods and yield promising results by using
unlabeled data to capture domain-specific features. However, these methods
either incur high computational costs or suffer from performance limitations,
while also demonstrating insufficient generalization across different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose AQuilt, a framework for constructing
instruction-tuning data for any specialized domains from corresponding
unlabeled data, including Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic,
and Task type. By incorporating logic and inspection, we encourage reasoning
processes and self-inspection to enhance model performance. Moreover,
customizable task instructions enable high-quality data generation for any
task. As a result, we construct a dataset of 703k examples to train a powerful
data synthesis model. Experiments show that AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3
while utilizing just 17% of the production cost. Further analysis demonstrates
that our generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks. Source

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRPrompt框架通过将文本反馈直接融入提示模型的训练中，统一了两种主要的提示优化方法，无需数据集收集，并生成针对特定查询的最优提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理能力，无需更新目标模型的参数，同时结合文本反馈和训练方法。

Method: 引入Textual Reward Prompt框架（TRPrompt），通过文本反馈训练提示模型，利用LLM对“好”提示的理解能力。

Result: 在GSMHard和MATH等数学数据集上生成最先进的查询特定提示。

Conclusion: TRPrompt框架通过文本反馈和训练的结合，显著提升了提示优化的效果。

Abstract: Prompt optimization improves the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) without requiring parameter updates to the target model. Following
heuristic-based "Think step by step" approaches, the field has evolved in two
main directions: while one group of methods uses textual feedback to elicit
improved prompts from general-purpose LLMs in a training-free way, a concurrent
line of research relies on numerical rewards to train a special prompt model,
tailored for providing optimal prompts to the target model. In this paper, we
introduce the Textual Reward Prompt framework (TRPrompt), which unifies these
approaches by directly incorporating textual feedback into training of the
prompt model. Our framework does not require prior dataset collection and is
being iteratively improved with the feedback on the generated prompts. When
coupled with the capacity of an LLM to internalize the notion of what a "good"
prompt is, the high-resolution signal provided by the textual rewards allows us
to train a prompt model yielding state-of-the-art query-specific prompts for
the problems from the challenging math datasets GSMHard and MATH.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于清单反馈的强化学习方法（RLCF），通过动态评估指令完成情况来提升语言模型的指令遵循能力，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法使用固定标准（如“有用性”和“有害性”）来调整语言模型，限制了其适应多样化指令的能力。RLCF旨在通过动态、指令特定的标准来扩展强化学习的应用范围。

Method: RLCF从指令中提取清单，结合AI评估和专用验证程序对响应进行评分，生成强化学习的奖励信号。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，RLCF显著提升了性能，包括FollowBench（4点提升）、InFoBench（6点提升）和Arena-Hard（3点胜率提升）。

Conclusion: 清单反馈是一种有效工具，可显著提升语言模型对多样化查询的支持能力。

Abstract: Language models must be adapted to understand and follow user instructions.
Reinforcement learning is widely used to facilitate this -- typically using
fixed criteria such as "helpfulness" and "harmfulness". In our work, we instead
propose using flexible, instruction-specific criteria as a means of broadening
the impact that reinforcement learning can have in eliciting instruction
following. We propose "Reinforcement Learning from Checklist Feedback" (RLCF).
From instructions, we extract checklists and evaluate how well responses
satisfy each item - using both AI judges and specialized verifier programs -
then combine these scores to compute rewards for RL. We compare RLCF with other
alignment methods applied to a strong instruction following model
(Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) on five widely-studied benchmarks -- RLCF is the only
method to improve performance on every benchmark, including a 4-point boost in
hard satisfaction rate on FollowBench, a 6-point increase on InFoBench, and a
3-point rise in win rate on Arena-Hard. These results establish checklist
feedback as a key tool for improving language models' support of queries that
express a multitude of needs.

Motivation: 重新审视并振兴自回归范式，以实现高质量图像生成，同时避免依赖预训练组件或混合架构的限制。

Method: 采用从头训练的自回归模型，统一的分词方案支持多任务处理，并引入高效解码策略提升生成质量和速度。

Result: 在文本到图像基准测试中表现优异，部分超越扩散模型，并在多任务基准Graph200K上表现突出。

Conclusion: Lumina-mGPT 2.0是一个强大且灵活的多模态生成基础模型，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We present Lumina-mGPT 2.0, a stand-alone, decoder-only autoregressive model
that revisits and revitalizes the autoregressive paradigm for high-quality
image generation and beyond. Unlike existing approaches that rely on pretrained
components or hybrid architectures, Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is trained entirely from
scratch, enabling unrestricted architectural design and licensing freedom. It
achieves generation quality on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models such
as DALL-E 3 and SANA, while preserving the inherent flexibility and
compositionality of autoregressive modeling. Our unified tokenization scheme
allows the model to seamlessly handle a wide spectrum of tasks-including
subject-driven generation, image editing, controllable synthesis, and dense
prediction-within a single generative framework. To further boost usability, we
incorporate efficient decoding strategies like inference-time scaling and
speculative Jacobi sampling to improve quality and speed, respectively.
Extensive evaluations on standard text-to-image benchmarks (e.g., GenEval, DPG)
demonstrate that Lumina-mGPT 2.0 not only matches but in some cases surpasses
diffusion-based models. Moreover, we confirm its multi-task capabilities on the
Graph200K benchmark, with the native Lumina-mGPT 2.0 performing exceptionally
well. These results position Lumina-mGPT 2.0 as a strong, flexible foundation
model for unified multimodal generation. We have released our training details,

Motivation: 传统体育视频分析模型计算量大且缺乏对运动细节的捕捉，无法有效识别关键动作阶段（如准备、执行和后续动作）。

Method: 采用DWT-VGG16-LDA关键帧提取机制和V-DWT-JEPA2编码器，结合LLM解码器，实现高效的视频分析和动作描述生成。

Result: 在NSVA篮球数据集上，SV3.3B在文本生成和体育特定指标上表现优异，优于GPT-4o变体，计算需求更低。

Conclusion: SV3.3B在体育动作描述生成上表现出色，信息密度和动作复杂性显著提升，适用于全面的体育分析。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of automated sports video analysis, which
has traditionally been limited by computationally intensive models requiring
server-side processing and lacking fine-grained understanding of athletic
movements. Current approaches struggle to capture the nuanced biomechanical
transitions essential for meaningful sports analysis, often missing critical
phases like preparation, execution, and follow-through that occur within
seconds. To address these limitations, we introduce SV3.3B, a lightweight 3.3B
parameter video understanding model that combines novel temporal motion
difference sampling with self-supervised learning for efficient on-device
deployment. Our approach employs a DWT-VGG16-LDA based keyframe extraction
mechanism that intelligently identifies the 16 most representative frames from
sports sequences, followed by a V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder pretrained through
mask-denoising objectives and an LLM decoder fine-tuned for sports action
description generation. Evaluated on a subset of the NSVA basketball dataset,
SV3.3B achieves superior performance across both traditional text generation
metrics and sports-specific evaluation criteria, outperforming larger
closed-source models including GPT-4o variants while maintaining significantly
lower computational requirements. Our model demonstrates exceptional capability
in generating technically detailed and analytically rich sports descriptions,
achieving 29.2% improvement over GPT-4o in ground truth validation metrics,
with substantial improvements in information density, action complexity, and
measurement precision metrics essential for comprehensive athletic analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型在处理涉及多主体和复杂属性的提示时表现不佳，受人类绘画过程的启发，提出Detail++以改进这一问题。

Method: 分解复杂提示为简化子提示，分阶段生成；利用自注意力机制控制全局布局，并通过交叉注意力机制和质心对齐损失增强属性一致性。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench和新构建的风格组合基准测试中，Detail++显著优于现有方法，尤其在多对象和复杂风格场景下。

Conclusion: Detail++通过渐进式细节注入和属性绑定优化，有效提升了复杂提示下的文本到图像生成质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to impressive
visual results. However, these models still face significant challenges when
handling complex prompt, particularly those involving multiple subjects with
distinct attributes. Inspired by the human drawing process, which first
outlines the composition and then incrementally adds details, we propose
Detail++, a training-free framework that introduces a novel Progressive Detail
Injection (PDI) strategy to address this limitation. Specifically, we decompose
a complex prompt into a sequence of simplified sub-prompts, guiding the
generation process in stages. This staged generation leverages the inherent
layout-controlling capacity of self-attention to first ensure global
composition, followed by precise refinement. To achieve accurate binding
between attributes and corresponding subjects, we exploit cross-attention
mechanisms and further introduce a Centroid Alignment Loss at test time to
reduce binding noise and enhance attribute consistency. Extensive experiments
on T2I-CompBench and a newly constructed style composition benchmark
demonstrate that Detail++ significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scenarios involving multiple objects and complex stylistic
conditions.

Abstract: Accurate fish detection in underwater imagery is essential for ecological
monitoring, aquaculture automation, and robotic perception. However, practical
deployment remains limited by fragmented datasets, heterogeneous imaging
conditions, and inconsistent evaluation protocols. To address these gaps, we
present \textit{FishDet-M}, the largest unified benchmark for fish detection,
comprising 13 publicly available datasets spanning diverse aquatic environments
including marine, brackish, occluded, and aquarium scenes. All data are
harmonized using COCO-style annotations with both bounding boxes and
segmentation masks, enabling consistent and scalable cross-domain evaluation.
We systematically benchmark 28 contemporary object detection models, covering
the YOLOv8 to YOLOv12 series, R-CNN based detectors, and DETR based models.
Evaluations are conducted using standard metrics including mAP, mAP@50, and
mAP@75, along with scale-specific analyses (AP$_S$, AP$_M$, AP$_L$) and
inference profiling in terms of latency and parameter count. The results
highlight the varying detection performance across models trained on FishDet-M,
as well as the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency across models of
different architectures. To support adaptive deployment, we introduce a
CLIP-based model selection framework that leverages vision-language alignment
to dynamically identify the most semantically appropriate detector for each
input image. This zero-shot selection strategy achieves high performance
without requiring ensemble computation, offering a scalable solution for
real-time applications. FishDet-M establishes a standardized and reproducible
platform for evaluating object detection in complex aquatic scenes. All
datasets, pretrained models, and evaluation tools are publicly available to
facilitate future research in underwater computer vision and intelligent marine

Motivation: 深度学习在皮肤癌筛查中的应用潜力巨大，但存在潜在偏见，评估和改进公平性至关重要。

Method: 利用先进的生成式AI模型（LightningDiT）评估公开可用的黑色素瘤分类器的公平性。

Result: 使用高度真实的合成数据评估公平性具有前景，但若评估模型与合成数据训练数据不同，公平性验证会变得困难。

Conclusion: 该研究为利用合成数据评估和改进医疗影像AI系统的公平性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning and its application on the edge hold
great potential for the revolution of routine screenings for skin cancers like
Melanoma. Along with the anticipated benefits of this technology, potential
dangers arise from unforseen and inherent biases. Thus, assessing and improving
the fairness of such systems is of utmost importance. A key challenge in
fairness assessment is to ensure that the evaluation dataset is sufficiently
representative of different Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (sex, age,
and race) and other minority groups. Against the backdrop of this challenge,
this study leverages the state-of-the-art Generative AI (GenAI) LightningDiT
model to assess the fairness of publicly available melanoma classifiers. The
results suggest that fairness assessment using highly realistic synthetic data
is a promising direction. Yet, our findings indicate that verifying fairness
becomes difficult when the melanoma-detection model used for evaluation is
trained on data that differ from the dataset underpinning the synthetic images.
Nonetheless, we propose that our approach offers a valuable new avenue for
employing synthetic data to gauge and enhance fairness in medical-imaging GenAI
systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer的图像恢复方法DiNAT-IR，通过结合局部和全局注意力机制，解决了传统方法在高分辨率图像上的效率与质量平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的自注意力机制在图像恢复任务中表现优异，但计算成本高且可能忽略局部细节。DiNA（扩张邻域注意力）在高层次视觉任务中成功，但直接应用于去模糊任务效果不佳。

Method: 提出DiNAT-IR，结合滑动窗口注意力和混合扩张因子，并通过通道感知模块补充局部注意力，以整合全局上下文。

Result: DiNAT-IR在多个基准测试中取得竞争性结果，为低层次计算机视觉问题提供了高质量解决方案。

Conclusion: DiNAT-IR通过平衡全局和局部注意力，显著提升了图像恢复任务的性能，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Transformers, with their self-attention mechanisms for modeling long-range
dependencies, have become a dominant paradigm in image restoration tasks.
However, the high computational cost of self-attention limits scalability to
high-resolution images, making efficiency-quality trade-offs a key research
focus. To address this, Restormer employs channel-wise self-attention, which
computes attention across channels instead of spatial dimensions. While
effective, this approach may overlook localized artifacts that are crucial for
high-quality image restoration. To bridge this gap, we explore Dilated
Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) as a promising alternative, inspired by its
success in high-level vision tasks. DiNA balances global context and local
precision by integrating sliding-window attention with mixed dilation factors,
effectively expanding the receptive field without excessive overhead. However,
our preliminary experiments indicate that directly applying this global-local
design to the classic deblurring task hinders accurate visual restoration,
primarily due to the constrained global context understanding within local
attention. To address this, we introduce a channel-aware module that
complements local attention, effectively integrating global context without
sacrificing pixel-level precision. The proposed DiNAT-IR, a Transformer-based
architecture specifically designed for image restoration, achieves competitive
results across multiple benchmarks, offering a high-quality solution for
diverse low-level computer vision problems.

Motivation: 现有UDA-SS方法难以平衡局部细节与全局上下文信息，导致复杂区域分割错误。

Method: 引入AFR模块，利用低分辨率语义先验细化高分辨率特征，并整合高频组件和不确定性驱动的注意力机制。

Result: 在GTA V→Cityscapes和Synthia→Cityscapes上分别提升1.05%和1.04%的mIoU。

Conclusion: AFR模块轻量且高效，显著提升了UDA-SS的分割性能。

Abstract: In Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS), a model is
trained on labeled source domain data (e.g., synthetic images) and adapted to
an unlabeled target domain (e.g., real-world images) without access to target
annotations. Existing UDA-SS methods often struggle to balance fine-grained
local details with global contextual information, leading to segmentation
errors in complex regions. To address this, we introduce the Adaptive Feature
Refinement (AFR) module, which enhances segmentation accuracy by refining
highresolution features using semantic priors from low-resolution logits. AFR
also integrates high-frequency components, which capture fine-grained
structures and provide crucial boundary information, improving object
delineation. Additionally, AFR adaptively balances local and global information
through uncertaintydriven attention, reducing misclassifications. Its
lightweight design allows seamless integration into HRDA-based UDA methods,
leading to state-of-the-art segmentation performance. Our approach improves
existing UDA-SS methods by 1.05% mIoU on GTA V --> Cityscapes and 1.04% mIoU on
Synthia-->Cityscapes. The implementation of our framework is available at:

Result: 数据集包含35小时数据，模型识别准确率最高达81%。

Conclusion: OPEN为老年人群体的个性化参与度建模提供了基础，并推动了参与度识别研究。

Abstract: Engagement in virtual learning is essential for participant satisfaction,
performance, and adherence, particularly in online education and virtual
rehabilitation, where interactive communication plays a key role. Yet,
accurately measuring engagement in virtual group settings remains a challenge.
There is increasing interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) for
large-scale, real-world, automated engagement recognition. While engagement has
been widely studied in younger academic populations, research and datasets
focused on older adults in virtual and telehealth learning settings remain
limited. Existing methods often neglect contextual relevance and the
longitudinal nature of engagement across sessions. This paper introduces OPEN
(Older adult Patient ENgagement), a novel dataset supporting AI-driven
engagement recognition. It was collected from eleven older adults participating
in weekly virtual group learning sessions over six weeks as part of cardiac
rehabilitation, producing over 35 hours of data, making it the largest dataset
of its kind. To protect privacy, raw video is withheld; instead, the released
data include facial, hand, and body joint landmarks, along with affective and
behavioral features extracted from video. Annotations include binary engagement
states, affective and behavioral labels, and context-type indicators, such as
whether the instructor addressed the group or an individual. The dataset offers
versions with 5-, 10-, 30-second, and variable-length samples. To demonstrate
utility, multiple machine learning and deep learning models were trained,
achieving engagement recognition accuracy of up to 81 percent. OPEN provides a
scalable foundation for personalized engagement modeling in aging populations
and contributes to broader engagement recognition research.

Abstract: Traditional monitoring of bearded dragon (Pogona Viticeps) behaviour is
time-consuming and prone to errors. This project introduces an automated system

1200 images, encompassing bearded dragons (600), heating lamps (500), and
crickets (100). YOLOv8s was selected as the optimal model due to its superior
balance of accuracy (mAP@0.5:0.95 = 0.855) and speed. The system processes
video footage by extracting per-frame object coordinates, applying temporal
interpolation for continuity, and using rule-based logic to classify specific
behaviours. Basking detection proved reliable. However, hunting detection was
less accurate, primarily due to weak cricket detection (mAP@0.5 = 0.392).
Future improvements will focus on enhancing cricket detection through expanded
datasets or specialised small-object detectors. This automated system offers a
scalable solution for monitoring reptile behaviour in controlled environments,
significantly improving research efficiency and data quality.

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) across visible and infrared modalities is
crucial for 24-hour surveillance systems, but existing datasets primarily focus
on ground-level perspectives. While ground-based IR systems offer nighttime
capabilities, they suffer from occlusions, limited coverage, and vulnerability
to obstructions--problems that aerial perspectives uniquely solve. To address
these limitations, we introduce AG-VPReID.VIR, the first aerial-ground
cross-modality video-based person Re-ID dataset. This dataset captures 1,837
identities across 4,861 tracklets (124,855 frames) using both UAV-mounted and
fixed CCTV cameras in RGB and infrared modalities. AG-VPReID.VIR presents
unique challenges including cross-viewpoint variations, modality discrepancies,
and temporal dynamics. Additionally, we propose TCC-VPReID, a novel
three-stream architecture designed to address the joint challenges of
cross-platform and cross-modality person Re-ID. Our approach bridges the domain
gaps between aerial-ground perspectives and RGB-IR modalities, through
style-robust feature learning, memory-based cross-view adaptation, and
intermediary-guided temporal modeling. Experiments show that AG-VPReID.VIR
presents distinctive challenges compared to existing datasets, with our
TCC-VPReID framework achieving significant performance gains across multiple
evaluation protocols. Dataset and code are available at

Conclusion: 研究揭示了标签偏差对医学影像AI子群公平性的重要影响，为未来改进提供了依据。

Abstract: Systematic mislabelling affecting specific subgroups (i.e., label bias) in
medical imaging datasets represents an understudied issue concerning the
fairness of medical AI systems. In this work, we investigated how size and
separability of subgroups affected by label bias influence the learned features
and performance of a deep learning model. Therefore, we trained deep learning
models for binary tissue density classification using the EMory BrEast imaging
Dataset (EMBED), where label bias affected separable subgroups (based on
imaging manufacturer) or non-separable "pseudo-subgroups". We found that
simulated subgroup label bias led to prominent shifts in the learned feature
representations of the models. Importantly, these shifts within the feature
space were dependent on both the relative size and the separability of the
subgroup affected by label bias. We also observed notable differences in
subgroup performance depending on whether a validation set with clean labels
was used to define the classification threshold for the model. For instance,
with label bias affecting the majority separable subgroup, the true positive
rate for that subgroup fell from 0.898, when the validation set had clean
labels, to 0.518, when the validation set had biased labels. Our work
represents a key contribution toward understanding the consequences of label
bias on subgroup fairness in medical imaging AI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅能测量Grassmannian特征的接近度，而无法将其表示为刚性变换的显式函数，限制了其在配准问题中的应用。

Method: 通过数学证明，利用高维线性子空间的基作为成本的显式表示，提出基于变换基的可优化成本函数。

Result: 提出的成本函数及其扩展在多种计算机视觉任务中优于现有方法，并实现了全局最优解。

Conclusion: 该方法为Grassmannian特征的配准问题提供了有效的解决方案，并在实际应用中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Affine Grassmannian has been favored for expressing proximity between lines
and planes due to its theoretical exactness in measuring distances among
features. Despite this advantage, the existing method can only measure the
proximity without yielding the distance as an explicit function of rigid body
transformation. Thus, an optimizable distance function on the manifold has
remained underdeveloped, stifling its application in registration problems.
This paper is the first to explicitly derive an optimizable cost function
between two Grassmannian features with respect to rigid body transformation
($\mathbf{R}$ and $\mathbf{t}$). Specifically, we present a rigorous
mathematical proof demonstrating that the bases of high-dimensional linear
subspaces can serve as an explicit representation of the cost. Finally, we
propose an optimizable cost function based on the transformed bases that can be
applied to the registration problem of any affine subspace. Compared to vector
parameter-based approaches, our method is able to find a globally optimal
solution by directly minimizing the geodesic distance which is agnostic to
representation ambiguity. The resulting cost function and its extension to the
inlier-set maximizing \ac{BnB} solver have been demonstrated to improve the
convergence of existing solutions or outperform them in various computer vision
tasks. The code is available on

Motivation: 现有SOTA多模态模型在架构上落后于当代大型语言模型（LLMs），需要改进以提升性能。

Method: 在CoCa模型中引入高斯误差门控线性单元、均方根归一化和旋转位置嵌入，优化文本解码器和视觉Transformer编码器。

Result: GRR-CoCa在预训练和微调任务中显著优于基线模型，对比损失、困惑度和CoCa损失均有显著提升。

Conclusion: GRR-CoCa的改进架构在多模态任务中表现出更好的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) image and text generation models are multimodal
models that have many similarities to large language models (LLMs). Despite
achieving strong performances, leading foundational multimodal model
architectures frequently lag behind the architectural sophistication of
contemporary LLMs. We propose GRR-CoCa, an improved SOTA Contrastive Captioner
(CoCa) model that incorporates Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean
squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding into the textual
decoders and the vision transformer (ViT) encoder. Each architectural
modification has been shown to improve model performance in LLMs, but has yet
to be adopted in CoCa. We benchmarked GRR-CoCa against Baseline CoCa, a model
with the same modified textual decoders but with CoCa's original ViT encoder.
We used standard pretraining and fine-tuning workflows to benchmark the models
on contrastive and generative tasks. Our GRR-CoCa significantly outperformed
Baseline CoCa on the pretraining dataset and three diverse fine-tuning
datasets. Pretraining improvements were 27.25% in contrastive loss, 3.71% in
perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss. The average fine-tuning improvements were
13.66% in contrastive loss, 5.18% in perplexity, and 5.55% in CoCa loss. We
show that GRR-CoCa's modified architecture improves performance and
generalization across vision-language domains.

Method: 基于Celeb-DF数据集，构建了Celeb-DF++，包含三种常见伪造场景（FS、FR、TF）和22种不同DeepFake方法生成的高质量视频。

Result: Celeb-DF++数据集覆盖了广泛的伪造类型，并通过评估协议揭示了现有检测方法的局限性。

Conclusion: Celeb-DF++为泛化性检测提供了挑战性基准，推动了DeepFake检测技术的发展。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI technologies has significantly increased the
diversity of DeepFake videos circulating online, posing a pressing challenge
for \textit{generalizable forensics}, \ie, detecting a wide range of unseen
DeepFake types using a single model. Addressing this challenge requires
datasets that are not only large-scale but also rich in forgery diversity.
However, most existing datasets, despite their scale, include only a limited
variety of forgery types, making them insufficient for developing generalizable
detection methods. Therefore, we build upon our earlier Celeb-DF dataset and
introduce {Celeb-DF++}, a new large-scale and challenging video DeepFake
benchmark dedicated to the generalizable forensics challenge. Celeb-DF++ covers
three commonly encountered forgery scenarios: Face-swap (FS), Face-reenactment
(FR), and Talking-face (TF). Each scenario contains a substantial number of
high-quality forged videos, generated using a total of 22 various recent
DeepFake methods. These methods differ in terms of architectures, generation
pipelines, and targeted facial regions, covering the most prevalent DeepFake
cases witnessed in the wild. We also introduce evaluation protocols for
measuring the generalizability of 24 recent detection methods, highlighting the
limitations of existing detection methods and the difficulty of our new
dataset.

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，优于现有方法，视觉质量和视角一致性均有提升。

Conclusion: 该框架为3D场景修复提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view 3D reconstruction and novel-view synthesis,
particularly through Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have greatly enhanced the fidelity and efficiency of 3D content
creation. However, inpainting 3D scenes remains a challenging task due to the
inherent irregularity of 3D structures and the critical need for maintaining
multi-view consistency. In this work, we propose a novel 3D Gaussian inpainting
framework that reconstructs complete 3D scenes by leveraging sparse inpainted
views. Our framework incorporates an automatic Mask Refinement Process and
region-wise Uncertainty-guided Optimization. Specifically, we refine the
inpainting mask using a series of operations, including Gaussian scene
filtering and back-projection, enabling more accurate localization of occluded
regions and realistic boundary restoration. Furthermore, our Uncertainty-guided
Fine-grained Optimization strategy, which estimates the importance of each
region across multi-view images during training, alleviates multi-view
inconsistencies and enhances the fidelity of fine details in the inpainted
results. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse datasets demonstrate
that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
quality and view consistency.

Abstract: Emotion recognition through body movements has emerged as a compelling and
privacy-preserving alternative to traditional methods that rely on facial
expressions or physiological signals. Recent advancements in 3D skeleton
acquisition technologies and pose estimation algorithms have significantly
enhanced the feasibility of emotion recognition based on full-body motion. This
survey provides a comprehensive and systematic review of skeleton-based emotion
recognition techniques. First, we introduce psychological models of emotion and
examine the relationship between bodily movements and emotional expression.
Next, we summarize publicly available datasets, highlighting the differences in
data acquisition methods and emotion labeling strategies. We then categorize
existing methods into posture-based and gait-based approaches, analyzing them
from both data-driven and technical perspectives. In particular, we propose a
unified taxonomy that encompasses four primary technical paradigms: Traditional
approaches, Feat2Net, FeatFusionNet, and End2EndNet. Representative works
within each category are reviewed and compared, with benchmarking results
across commonly used datasets. Finally, we explore the extended applications of
emotion recognition in mental health assessment, such as detecting depression
and autism, and discuss the open challenges and future research directions in
this rapidly evolving field.

Conclusion: ViGText通过视觉和文本的详细分析，为深度伪造检测设定了新标准，有助于保障媒体真实性和信息完整性。

Abstract: The rapid rise of deepfake technology, which produces realistic but
fraudulent digital content, threatens the authenticity of media. Traditional
deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized
deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against
malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that
integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations
within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of
ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as
it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack
specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically
divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates
them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes.
Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency
domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to
detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText
significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost
when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise
from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's
superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable
diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in
recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted
attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits
classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed
visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes,
helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成视频模型在短片段单场景任务中表现良好，但在长视频多场景转换中表现不佳，主要因为缺乏对场景转换的识别能力。

Method: 提出了Transition-Aware Video (TAV)数据集，包含多场景转换的预处理视频片段，并通过在该数据集上后训练模型。

Result: 实验表明，TAV数据集提升了模型对场景转换的理解能力，缩小了生成场景与需求场景之间的差距，同时保持了图像质量。

Conclusion: TAV数据集为多场景视频生成提供了有效解决方案，提升了模型的场景转换能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated video have shown strong performance on
\emph{text-to-video} tasks, particularly for short clips depicting a single
scene. However, current models struggle to generate longer videos with coherent
scene transitions, primarily because they cannot infer when a transition is
needed from the prompt. Most open-source models are trained on datasets
consisting of single-scene video clips, which limits their capacity to learn
and respond to prompts requiring multiple scenes. Developing scene transition
awareness is essential for multi-scene generation, as it allows models to
identify and segment videos into distinct clips by accurately detecting
transitions.
  To address this, we propose the \textbf{Transition-Aware Video} (TAV)
dataset, which consists of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene
transitions. Our experiment shows that post-training on the \textbf{TAV}
dataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap
between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.

Abstract: We introduce BokehDiff, a novel lens blur rendering method that achieves
physically accurate and visually appealing outcomes, with the help of
generative diffusion prior. Previous methods are bounded by the accuracy of
depth estimation, generating artifacts in depth discontinuities. Our method
employs a physics-inspired self-attention module that aligns with the image
formation process, incorporating depth-dependent circle of confusion constraint
and self-occlusion effects. We adapt the diffusion model to the one-step
inference scheme without introducing additional noise, and achieve results of
high quality and fidelity. To address the lack of scalable paired data, we
propose to synthesize photorealistic foregrounds with transparency with
diffusion models, balancing authenticity and scene diversity.

Conclusion: VLM-IMI通过语义指导和迭代优化，显著提升了低光图像增强的效果。

Abstract: Most existing low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods rely on pre-trained
model priors, low-light inputs, or both, while neglecting the semantic guidance
available from normal-light images. This limitation hinders their effectiveness
in complex lighting conditions. In this paper, we propose VLM-IMI, a novel
framework that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) with iterative and
manual instructions (IMIs) for LLIE. VLM-IMI incorporates textual descriptions
of the desired normal-light content as enhancement cues, enabling semantically
informed restoration. To effectively integrate cross-modal priors, we introduce
an instruction prior fusion module, which dynamically aligns and fuses image
and text features, promoting the generation of detailed and semantically
coherent outputs. During inference, we adopt an iterative and manual
instruction strategy to refine textual instructions, progressively improving
visual quality. This refinement enhances structural fidelity, semantic
alignment, and the recovery of fine details under extremely low-light
conditions. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that
VLM-IMI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and
perceptual quality. The source code is available at

Conclusion: TextSAM-EUS首次将提示学习引入SAM的医学图像分割，为EUS分割提供了高效、鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer carries a poor prognosis and relies on endoscopic
ultrasound (EUS) for targeted biopsy and radiotherapy. However, the speckle
noise, low contrast, and unintuitive appearance of EUS make segmentation of
pancreatic tumors with fully supervised deep learning (DL) models both
error-prone and dependent on large, expert-curated annotation datasets. To
address these challenges, we present TextSAM-EUS, a novel, lightweight,
text-driven adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that requires no
manual geometric prompts at inference. Our approach leverages text prompt
learning (context optimization) through the BiomedCLIP text encoder in
conjunction with a LoRA-based adaptation of SAM's architecture to enable
automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, tuning only 0.86% of the total
parameters. On the public Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas,
TextSAM-EUS with automatic prompts attains 82.69% Dice and 85.28% normalized
surface distance (NSD), and with manual geometric prompts reaches 83.10% Dice
and 85.70% NSD, outperforming both existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised
DL models and foundation models (e.g., SAM and its variants). As the first
attempt to incorporate prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation,
TextSAM-EUS offers a practical option for efficient and robust automatic EUS
segmentation. Our code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: HDF框架通过双模块设计有效解决了样本异质性和优化不平衡问题，提升了动态面部表情识别的性能。

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) plays a critical role in
affective computing and human-computer interaction. Although existing methods
achieve comparable performance, they inevitably suffer from performance
degradation under sample heterogeneity caused by multi-source data and
individual expression variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel framework, called Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF), and
design two plug-and-play modules to enhance time-frequency modeling and
mitigate optimization imbalance caused by hard samples. Specifically, the
Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) captures both temporal
consistency and frequency robustness through a dual-branch attention design,
improving tolerance to sequence inconsistency and visual style shifts. Then,
based on gradient sensitivity and information bottleneck principles, an
adaptive optimization module Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) is
introduced to dynamically balance classification and contrastive losses,
enabling more stable and discriminative representation learning. Extensive
experiments on two widely used datasets, DFEW and FERV39k, demonstrate that HDF
significantly improves both recognition accuracy and robustness. Our method
achieves superior weighted average recall (WAR) and unweighted average recall
(UAR) while maintaining strong generalization across diverse and imbalanced
scenarios. Codes are released at https://github.com/QIcita/HDF_DFER.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize relevant temporal segments in
videos given natural language queries. Despite recent progress with large
vision-language models (LVLMs) and instruction-tuning, existing approaches
often suffer from limited temporal awareness and poor generalization. In this
work, we introduce a two-stage training framework that integrates supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve both the accuracy and
robustness of VTG models. Our approach first leverages high-quality curated
cold start data for SFT initialization, followed by difficulty-controlled RL to
further enhance temporal localization and reasoning abilities. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple VTG benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing models, particularly in challenging and open-domain
scenarios. We conduct an in-depth analysis of training strategies and dataset
curation, highlighting the importance of both high-quality cold start data and
difficulty-controlled RL. To facilitate further research and industrial
adoption, we release all intermediate datasets, models, and code to the
community.

Result: 模型在分布内和分布外数据上表现优异，验证了时序感知和多模态序列建模的有效性。

Conclusion: 该模型成功捕捉了刺激和神经响应的长程时间结构，并处理了个体差异。

Abstract: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge called on the community to develop encoding
models that predict whole-brain fMRI responses to naturalistic multimodal
movies. In this submission, we propose a sequence-to-sequence Transformer that
autoregressively predicts fMRI activity from visual, auditory, and language
inputs. Stimulus features were extracted using pretrained models including
VideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, and BridgeTower. The decoder integrates information
from prior brain states, current stimuli, and episode-level summaries via dual
cross-attention mechanisms that attend to both perceptual information extracted
from the stimulus as well as narrative information provided by high-level
summaries of narrative content. One core innovation of our approach is the use
of sequences of multimodal context to predict sequences of brain activity,
enabling the model to capture long-range temporal structure in both stimuli and
neural responses. Another is the combination of a shared encoder with partial
subject-specific decoder, which leverages common structure across subjects
while accounting for individual variability. Our model achieves strong
performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, demonstrating
the effectiveness of temporally-aware, multimodal sequence modeling for brain
activity prediction. The code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如MC Dropout仅关注模型或数据不确定性，未能与OoD检测的语义目标对齐。

Method: 结合自由能密度估计器和后验网络，直接估计不确定性，无需随机采样。

Result: 在Fishyscapes等真实基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种语义明确且计算高效的解决方案，适用于不确定性感知的分割任务。

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty from deep neural networks is a widely used approach
for detecting out-of-distribution (OoD) samples, which typically exhibit high
predictive uncertainty. However, conventional methods such as Monte Carlo (MC)
Dropout often focus solely on either model or data uncertainty, failing to
align with the semantic objective of OoD detection. To address this, we propose
the Free-Energy Posterior Network, a novel framework that jointly models
distributional uncertainty and identifying OoD and misclassified regions using
free energy. Our method introduces two key contributions: (1) a
free-energy-based density estimator parameterized by a Beta distribution, which
enables fine-grained uncertainty estimation near ambiguous or unseen regions;
and (2) a loss integrated within a posterior network, allowing direct
uncertainty estimation from learned parameters without requiring stochastic
sampling. By integrating our approach with the residual prediction branch (RPL)
framework, the proposed method goes beyond post-hoc energy thresholding and
enables the network to learn OoD regions by leveraging the variance of the Beta
distribution, resulting in a semantically meaningful and computationally
efficient solution for uncertainty-aware segmentation. We validate the
effectiveness of our method on challenging real-world benchmarks, including
Fishyscapes, RoadAnomaly, and Segment-Me-If-You-Can.

Conclusion: 当前模型在世界知识利用上存在显著差距，为构建具有常识推理和事实生成能力的模型提供了研究方向。

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) models have shown remarkable performance in generating
visually reasonable scenes, while their capability to leverage world knowledge
for ensuring semantic consistency and factual accuracy remains largely
understudied. In response to this challenge, we propose T2VWorldBench, the
first systematic evaluation framework for evaluating the world knowledge
generation abilities of text-to-video models, covering 6 major categories, 60
subcategories, and 1,200 prompts across a wide range of domains, including
physics, nature, activity, culture, causality, and object. To address both
human preference and scalable evaluation, our benchmark incorporates both human
evaluation and automated evaluation using vision-language models (VLMs). We
evaluated the 10 most advanced text-to-video models currently available,
ranging from open source to commercial models, and found that most models are
unable to understand world knowledge and generate truly correct videos. These
findings point out a critical gap in the capability of current text-to-video
models to leverage world knowledge, providing valuable research opportunities
and entry points for constructing models with robust capabilities for
commonsense reasoning and factual generation.

Motivation: 医学图像分析中，曲线弯曲度的精确量化对辅助诊断和病理评估至关重要。传统方法依赖理想化直线比较，缺乏生物学合理性。

Method: 结合概率建模与熵理论，引入曲线数据的域变换，通过比较目标曲线与参考曲线来量化弯曲度。

Abstract: In the medical image analysis field, precise quantification of curve
tortuosity plays a critical role in the auxiliary diagnosis and pathological
assessment of various diseases. In this study, we propose a novel framework for
tortuosity quantification and demonstrate its effectiveness through the
evaluation of meibomian gland atrophy uniformity,serving as a representative
application scenario.
  We introduce an information entropy-based tortuosity quantification framework
that integrates probability modeling with entropy theory and incorporates
domain transformation of curve data. Unlike traditional methods such as
curvature or arc-chord ratio, this approach evaluates the tortuosity of a
target curve by comparing it to a designated reference curve. Consequently, it
is more suitable for tortuosity assessment tasks in medical data where
biologically plausible reference curves are available, providing a more robust
and objective evaluation metric without relying on idealized straight-line
comparisons.
  First, we conducted numerical simulation experiments to preliminarily assess
the stability and validity of the method. Subsequently, the framework was
applied to quantify the spatial uniformity of meibomian gland atrophy and to
analyze the difference in this uniformity between \textit{Demodex}-negative and
\textit{Demodex}-positive patient groups. The results demonstrated a
significant difference in tortuosity-based uniformity between the two groups,
with an area under the curve of 0.8768, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of
0.93. These findings highlight the clinical utility of the proposed framework
in curve tortuosity analysis and its potential as a generalizable tool for
quantitative morphological evaluation in medical diagnostics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有扩散方法因单向建模退化而难以捕捉真实世界复杂退化模式的问题。

Method: 采用双向扩散训练（低光到正常光及反向），引入自适应特征交互块（AFI）和反射感知校正模块（RACM）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，定量和定性评估均显示优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法能更一致地学习退化模式，生成符合人类视觉感知的高质量图像。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement aims to improve the visibility of degraded images
to better align with human visual perception. While diffusion-based methods
have shown promising performance due to their strong generative capabilities.
However, their unidirectional modelling of degradation often struggles to
capture the complexity of real-world degradation patterns, leading to
structural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments. To address these
challenges, we propose a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism that
jointly models the degradation processes of both low-light and normal-light
images, enabling more precise degradation parameter matching and enhancing
generation quality. Specifically, we perform bidirectional diffusion-from
low-to-normal light and from normal-to-low light during training and introduce
an adaptive feature interaction block (AFI) to refine feature representation.
By leveraging the complementarity between these two paths, our approach imposes
an implicit symmetry constraint on illumination attenuation and noise
distribution, facilitating consistent degradation learning and improving the
models ability to perceive illumination and detail degradation. Additionally,
we design a reflection-aware correction module (RACM) to guide color
restoration post-denoising and suppress overexposed regions, ensuring content
consistency and generating high-quality images that align with human visual
perception. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and
qualitative evaluations while generalizing effectively to diverse degradation
scenarios. Code at https://github.com/hejh8/BidDiff

Result: 在四个基准测试中平均mAP提升4.5%，超越现有最优方法。

Conclusion: WaveMamba通过高效跨模态融合，显著提升了目标检测性能。

Abstract: Leveraging the complementary characteristics of visible (RGB) and infrared
(IR) imagery offers significant potential for improving object detection. In
this paper, we propose WaveMamba, a cross-modality fusion method that
efficiently integrates the unique and complementary frequency features of RGB
and IR decomposed by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). An improved detection
head incorporating the Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT) is also
proposed to reduce information loss and produce the final detection results.
The core of our approach is the introduction of WaveMamba Fusion Block (WMFB),
which facilitates comprehensive fusion across low-/high-frequency sub-bands.
Within WMFB, the Low-frequency Mamba Fusion Block (LMFB), built upon the Mamba
framework, first performs initial low-frequency feature fusion with channel
swapping, followed by deep fusion with an advanced gated attention mechanism
for enhanced integration. High-frequency features are enhanced using a strategy
that applies an ``absolute maximum" fusion approach. These advancements lead to
significant performance gains, with our method surpassing state-of-the-art
approaches and achieving average mAP improvements of 4.5% on four benchmarks.

Abstract: Object detection and classification are crucial tasks across various
application domains, particularly in the development of safe and reliable
Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Existing deep learning-based methods
such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Single Shot Detectors (SSDs), and
You Only Look Once (YOLO) have demonstrated high performance in terms of

Motivation: 解决3D LiDAR语义分割因域偏移（如传感器类型、地理位置）导致的性能下降问题，避免目标数据的手动标注。

Result: 在从SemanticKITTI到SemanticPOSS和SemanticSlamantic的实验中，分割准确率显著提升。

Conclusion: 结合对比预训练和集成伪标签策略，无需目标域标注即可有效缩小复杂域差距。

Abstract: Addressing performance degradation in 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation due to
domain shifts (e.g., sensor type, geographical location) is crucial for
autonomous systems, yet manual annotation of target data is prohibitive. This
study addresses the challenge using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) and
introduces a novel two-stage framework to tackle it. Initially, unsupervised
contrastive learning at the segment level is used to pre-train a backbone
network, enabling it to learn robust, domain-invariant features without labels.
Subsequently, a multi-model pseudo-labeling strategy is introduced, utilizing
an ensemble of diverse state-of-the-art architectures (including projection,
voxel, hybrid, and cylinder-based methods). Predictions from these models are
aggregated via hard voting to generate high-quality, refined pseudo-labels for
the unlabeled target domain, mitigating single-model biases. The contrastively
pre-trained network is then fine-tuned using these robust pseudo-labels.
Experiments adapting from SemanticKITTI to unlabeled target datasets
(SemanticPOSS, SemanticSlamantic) demonstrate significant improvements in
segmentation accuracy compared to direct transfer and single-model UDA
approaches. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining contrastive
pre-training with refined ensemble pseudo-labeling for bridging complex domain
gaps without requiring target domain annotations.

Motivation: 解决深度学习在数据稀缺场景中因过拟合噪声和无关模式而泛化能力受限的问题。

Method: 提出Diff-UMamba架构，包含噪声抑制模块（NRM），通过信号差分策略减少编码器中的噪声激活。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上表现优于基线方法1-3%，在低数据条件下提升4-5%。

Conclusion: Diff-UMamba在医学图像分割中显著提升了泛化能力和鲁棒性，尤其在数据稀缺场景中。

Abstract: In data-scarce scenarios, deep learning models often overfit to noise and
irrelevant patterns, which limits their ability to generalize to unseen
samples. To address these challenges in medical image segmentation, we
introduce Diff-UMamba, a novel architecture that combines the UNet framework
with the mamba mechanism for modeling long-range dependencies. At the heart of
Diff-UMamba is a Noise Reduction Module (NRM), which employs a signal
differencing strategy to suppress noisy or irrelevant activations within the
encoder. This encourages the model to filter out spurious features and enhance
task-relevant representations, thereby improving its focus on clinically
meaningful regions. As a result, the architecture achieves improved
segmentation accuracy and robustness, particularly in low-data settings.
Diff-UMamba is evaluated on multiple public datasets, including MSD (lung and
pancreas) and AIIB23, demonstrating consistent performance gains of 1-3% over
baseline methods across diverse segmentation tasks. To further assess
performance under limited-data conditions, additional experiments are conducted
on the BraTS-21 dataset by varying the proportion of available training
samples. The approach is also validated on a small internal non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) dataset for gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentation in cone beam
CT (CBCT), where it achieves a 4-5% improvement over the baseline.

TL;DR: MatSSL是一种简化的自监督学习架构，通过门控特征融合整合多级表示，适用于小规模无标签数据，显著提升金属材料显微图像分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前金属材料显微图像分析依赖监督方法，需针对每个新数据集重新训练且在小样本下表现不稳定。自监督学习虽有望解决此问题，但现有方法通常依赖大规模数据集。

Method: MatSSL采用门控特征融合在骨干网络的每个阶段整合多级表示，先在小规模无标签数据上进行自监督预训练，再在多个基准数据集上微调。

Result: 在MetalDAM上达到69.13% mIoU，优于ImageNet预训练编码器的66.73%；在EBC数据集上平均mIoU提升近40%。

Conclusion: MatSSL能有效适应金属学领域，仅需少量无标签数据，同时保留从大规模自然图像预训练中学到的丰富可迁移特征。

Abstract: MatSSL is a streamlined self-supervised learning (SSL) architecture that
employs Gated Feature Fusion at each stage of the backbone to integrate
multi-level representations effectively. Current micrograph analysis of
metallic materials relies on supervised methods, which require retraining for
each new dataset and often perform inconsistently with only a few labeled
samples. While SSL offers a promising alternative by leveraging unlabeled data,
most existing methods still depend on large-scale datasets to be effective.
MatSSL is designed to overcome this limitation. We first perform
self-supervised pretraining on a small-scale, unlabeled dataset and then
fine-tune the model on multiple benchmark datasets. The resulting segmentation
models achieve 69.13% mIoU on MetalDAM, outperforming the 66.73% achieved by an
ImageNet-pretrained encoder, and delivers consistently up to nearly 40%
improvement in average mIoU on the Environmental Barrier Coating benchmark
dataset (EBC) compared to models pretrained with MicroNet. This suggests that
MatSSL enables effective adaptation to the metallographic domain using only a
small amount of unlabeled data, while preserving the rich and transferable
features learned from large-scale pretraining on natural images.

Result: 学生模型推理速度提升6倍，图像质量与教师模型相当。

Conclusion: TeEFusion在保持高质量生成的同时，显著提升了效率，为文本到图像合成提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image synthesis largely benefit from sophisticated
sampling strategies and classifier-free guidance (CFG) to ensure high-quality
generation. However, CFG's reliance on two forward passes, especially when
combined with intricate sampling algorithms, results in prohibitively high
inference costs. To address this, we introduce TeEFusion (\textbf{Te}xt
\textbf{E}mbeddings \textbf{Fusion}), a novel and efficient distillation method
that directly incorporates the guidance magnitude into the text embeddings and
distills the teacher model's complex sampling strategy. By simply fusing
conditional and unconditional text embeddings using linear operations,
TeEFusion reconstructs the desired guidance without adding extra parameters,
simultaneously enabling the student model to learn from the teacher's output
produced via its sophisticated sampling approach. Extensive experiments on
state-of-the-art models such as SD3 demonstrate that our method allows the
student to closely mimic the teacher's performance with a far simpler and more
efficient sampling strategy. Consequently, the student model achieves inference
speeds up to 6$\times$ faster than the teacher model, while maintaining image
quality at levels comparable to those obtained through the teacher's complex
sampling approach. The code is publicly available at

Result: 实验显示方法在多疾病分割数据集上提升性能，且不增加推理时的参数或计算量。

Conclusion: LEAF高效改进医学图像分割，保持模型轻量，适合实际应用。

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful capabilities of diffusion models has yielded quite
effective results in medical image segmentation tasks. However, existing
methods typically transfer the original training process directly without
specific adjustments for segmentation tasks. Furthermore, the commonly used
pre-trained diffusion models still have deficiencies in feature extraction.
Based on these considerations, we propose LEAF, a medical image segmentation
model grounded in latent diffusion models. During the fine-tuning process, we
replace the original noise prediction pattern with a direct prediction of the
segmentation map, thereby reducing the variance of segmentation results. We
also employ a feature distillation method to align the hidden states of the
convolutional layers with the features from a transformer-based vision encoder.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of
the original diffusion model across multiple segmentation datasets for
different disease types. Notably, our approach does not alter the model
architecture, nor does it increase the number of parameters or computation
during the inference phase, making it highly efficient.

Result: 在基准数据集上，GSDTTA优于现有方法，验证了其高效性和有效性。

Conclusion: GSDTTA为3D点云分类提供了一种高效且无需额外训练数据的测试时适应解决方案。

Abstract: While test-time adaptation (TTA) methods effectively address domain shifts by
dynamically adapting pre-trained models to target domain data during online
inference, their application to 3D point clouds is hindered by their irregular
and unordered structure. Current 3D TTA methods often rely on computationally
expensive spatial-domain optimizations and may require additional training
data. In contrast, we propose Graph Spectral Domain Test-Time Adaptation
(GSDTTA), a novel approach for 3D point cloud classification that shifts
adaptation to the graph spectral domain, enabling more efficient adaptation by
capturing global structural properties with fewer parameters. Point clouds in
target domain are represented as outlier-aware graphs and transformed into
graph spectral domain by Graph Fourier Transform (GFT). For efficiency,
adaptation is performed by optimizing only the lowest 10% of frequency
components, which capture the majority of the point cloud's energy. An inverse
GFT (IGFT) is then applied to reconstruct the adapted point cloud with the
graph spectral-driven point shift. This process is enhanced by an
eigenmap-guided self-training strategy that iteratively refines both the
spectral adjustments and the model parameters. Experimental results and
ablation studies on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GSDTTA,
outperforming existing TTA methods for 3D point cloud classification.

Abstract: Feature-level fusion shows promise in collaborative perception (CP) through
balanced performance and communication bandwidth trade-off. However, its
effectiveness critically relies on input feature quality. The acquisition of
high-quality features faces domain gaps from hardware diversity and deployment
conditions, alongside temporal misalignment from transmission delays. These
challenges degrade feature quality with cumulative effects throughout the
collaborative network. In this paper, we present the Domain-And-Time Alignment
(DATA) network, designed to systematically align features while maximizing
their semantic representations for fusion. Specifically, we propose a
Consistency-preserving Domain Alignment Module (CDAM) that reduces domain gaps
through proximal-region hierarchical downsampling and observability-constrained
discriminator. We further propose a Progressive Temporal Alignment Module
(PTAM) to handle transmission delays via multi-scale motion modeling and
two-stage compensation. Building upon the aligned features, an Instance-focused
Feature Aggregation Module (IFAM) is developed to enhance semantic
representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DATA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on three typical datasets, maintaining robustness
with severe communication delays and pose errors. The code will be released at

TL;DR: 提出DepthDark模型，针对低光环境下的单目深度估计，通过模拟夜间成像和高效微调策略，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前单目深度估计方法在低光环境下效果显著下降，缺乏专门针对低光场景的鲁棒基础模型和大规模高质量数据集。

Method: 引入flare和噪声模拟模块生成高质量低光数据集，并提出基于光照引导和多尺度特征融合的高效微调策略。

Result: 在nuScenes-Night和RobotCar-Night数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: DepthDark在低光环境下表现出色，验证了其高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In recent years, foundation models for monocular depth estimation have
received increasing attention. Current methods mainly address typical daylight
conditions, but their effectiveness notably decreases in low-light
environments. There is a lack of robust foundational models for monocular depth
estimation specifically designed for low-light scenarios. This largely stems
from the absence of large-scale, high-quality paired depth datasets for
low-light conditions and the effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
strategy. To address these challenges, we propose DepthDark, a robust
foundation model for low-light monocular depth estimation. We first introduce a
flare-simulation module and a noise-simulation module to accurately simulate
the imaging process under nighttime conditions, producing high-quality paired
depth datasets for low-light conditions. Additionally, we present an effective
low-light PEFT strategy that utilizes illumination guidance and multiscale
feature fusion to enhance the model's capability in low-light environments. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation performance on the
challenging nuScenes-Night and RobotCar-Night datasets, validating its
effectiveness using limited training data and computing resources.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view scene reconstruction have been significant,
yet existing methods face limitations when processing streams of input images.
These methods either rely on time-consuming offline optimization or are
restricted to shorter sequences, hindering their applicability in real-time
scenarios. In this work, we propose LONG3R (LOng sequence streaming 3D
Reconstruction), a novel model designed for streaming multi-view 3D scene
reconstruction over longer sequences. Our model achieves real-time processing
by operating recurrently, maintaining and updating memory with each new
observation. We first employ a memory gating mechanism to filter relevant
memory, which, together with a new observation, is fed into a dual-source
refined decoder for coarse-to-fine interaction. To effectively capture
long-sequence memory, we propose a 3D spatio-temporal memory that dynamically
prunes redundant spatial information while adaptively adjusting resolution
along the scene. To enhance our model's performance on long sequences while
maintaining training efficiency, we employ a two-stage curriculum training
strategy, each stage targeting specific capabilities. Experiments demonstrate
that LONG3R outperforms state-of-the-art streaming methods, particularly for
longer sequences, while maintaining real-time inference speed. Project page:

Result: 在多种数据稀缺场景下，所提方法优于现有最先进的检测方法。

Conclusion: 通过高斯不可知表示学习和两阶段扩散模型，显著提升了红外小目标检测的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) plays a vital role in numerous
practical applications. In pursuit of determining the performance boundaries,
researchers employ large and expensive manual-labeling data for representation
learning. Nevertheless, this approach renders the state-of-the-art ISTD methods
highly fragile in real-world challenges. In this paper, we first study the
variation in detection performance across several mainstream methods under
various scarcity -- namely, the absence of high-quality infrared data -- that
challenge the prevailing theories about practical ISTD. To address this
concern, we introduce the Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning.
Specifically, we propose the Gaussian Group Squeezer, leveraging Gaussian
sampling and compression for non-uniform quantization. By exploiting a diverse
array of training samples, we enhance the resilience of ISTD models against
various challenges. Then, we introduce two-stage diffusion models for
real-world reconstruction. By aligning quantized signals closely with
real-world distributions, we significantly elevate the quality and fidelity of
the synthetic samples. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art
detection methods in various scarcity scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

TL;DR: 该研究使用双样本孟德尔随机化方法，探讨牙周炎和龋齿与肺癌亚型之间的因果关系，发现龋齿显著增加肺癌风险，尤其是鳞状细胞肺癌，部分由肺功能下降介导，而牙周炎无显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察性研究表明牙周炎和龋齿可能与肺癌相关，但因果关系尚不明确，因此研究旨在通过遗传学方法验证其因果性。

Method: 采用双样本孟德尔随机化（MR）分析，利用大规模全基因组关联研究数据，主要使用逆方差加权法，并通过delta方法评估肺功能的介导作用。

Result: 龋齿显著增加肺癌总体风险及鳞状细胞肺癌亚型风险（OR=2.880），部分由肺功能下降（FVC和FEV1）介导；牙周炎无显著影响。

Conclusion: 龋齿对肺癌风险有因果作用，建议将口腔护理和肺功能监测纳入癌症预防策略。

Abstract: Periodontitis and dental caries are common oral diseases affecting billions
globally. While observational studies suggest links between these conditions
and lung cancer, causality remains uncertain. This study used two sample
Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore causal relationships between dental
traits (periodontitis, dental caries) and lung cancer subtypes, and to assess
mediation by pulmonary function. Genetic instruments were derived from the
largest available genome wide association studies, including data from 487,823
dental caries and 506,594 periodontitis cases, as well as lung cancer data from
the Transdisciplinary Research of Cancer in Lung consortium. Inverse variance
weighting was the main analytical method; lung function mediation was assessed
using the delta method. The results showed a significant positive causal effect
of dental caries on overall lung cancer and its subtypes. Specifically, a one
standard deviation increase in dental caries incidence was associated with a
188.0% higher risk of squamous cell lung carcinoma (OR = 2.880, 95% CI =
1.236--6.713, p = 0.014), partially mediated by declines in forced vital
capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), accounting
for 5.124% and 5.890% of the total effect. No causal effect was found for
periodontitis. These findings highlight a causal role of dental caries in lung
cancer risk and support integrating dental care and pulmonary function
monitoring into cancer prevention strategies.

Motivation: 大型多模态模型（LMMs）在多模态任务中表现优异，但在目标检测能力上与专用检测器存在显著差距。

Method: 通过数据分布调整和推理优化提升召回率，并重新组织指令对话以增强LMMs的目标检测能力。

Result: 实验证明LMM-Det有效，且无需额外检测模块。

Conclusion: LMM-Det展示了大型多模态模型具备目标检测能力，为多模态任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have garnered wide-spread attention and
interest within the artificial intelligence research and industrial
communities, owing to their remarkable capability in multimodal understanding,
reasoning, and in-context learning, among others. While LMMs have demonstrated
promising results in tackling multimodal tasks like image captioning, visual
question answering, and visual grounding, the object detection capabilities of
LMMs exhibit a significant gap compared to specialist detectors. To bridge the
gap, we depart from the conventional methods of integrating heavy detectors
with LMMs and propose LMM-Det, a simple yet effective approach that leverages a
Large Multimodal Model for vanilla object Detection without relying on
specialized detection modules. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive
exploratory analysis when a large multimodal model meets with object detection,
revealing that the recall rate degrades significantly compared with specialist
detection models. To mitigate this, we propose to increase the recall rate by
introducing data distribution adjustment and inference optimization tailored
for object detection. We re-organize the instruction conversations to enhance
the object detection capabilities of large multimodal models. We claim that a
large multimodal model possesses detection capability without any extra
detection modules. Extensive experiments support our claim and show the
effectiveness of the versatile LMM-Det. The datasets, models, and codes are
available at https://github.com/360CVGroup/LMM-Det.

TL;DR: FieldLVLM框架通过结合领域感知语言生成和数据压缩多模态模型调优，显著提升了大型视觉语言模型在科学领域数据上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在科学领域（尤其是复杂现场数据理解）的应用尚未充分探索，需要一种新方法来提升其性能。

Method: FieldLVLM包含两部分：领域感知语言生成策略（提取关键物理特征并转换为结构化文本）和数据压缩多模态模型调优（简化输入并保留关键信息）。

Result: 实验表明，FieldLVLM在科学领域数据任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为大型视觉语言模型在科学研究中的应用提供了新可能性，缩小了大模型与领域特定发现之间的差距。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
across a range of tasks that integrate visual and textual understanding, such
as image captioning and visual question answering. These models are trained on
large-scale image and video datasets paired with text, enabling them to bridge
visual perception and natural language processing. However, their application
to scientific domains, especially in interpreting complex field data commonly
used in the natural sciences, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce
FieldLVLM, a novel framework designed to improve large vision-language models'
understanding of field data. FieldLVLM consists of two main components: a
field-aware language generation strategy and a data-compressed multimodal model
tuning. The field-aware language generation strategy leverages a
special-purpose machine learning pipeline to extract key physical features from
field data, such as flow classification, Reynolds number, and vortex patterns.
This information is then converted into structured textual descriptions that
serve as a dataset. The data-compressed multimodal model tuning focuses on
LVLMs with these generated datasets, using a data compression strategy to
reduce the complexity of field inputs and retain only the most informative
values. This ensures compatibility with the models language decoder and guides
its learning more effectively. Experimental results on newly proposed benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FieldLVLM significantly outperforms existing methods
in tasks involving scientific field data. Our findings suggest that this
approach opens up new possibilities for applying large vision-language models
to scientific research, helping bridge the gap between large models and
domain-specific discovery.

Result: Transformer在半监督ECG标注中表现优于卷积网络。

Conclusion: 提出的基准为半监督ECG标注方法的发展奠定了基础，并促进该领域进一步研究。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) delineation, the segmentation of meaningful waveform
features, is critical for clinical diagnosis. Despite recent advances using
deep learning, progress has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available
annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning presents a promising solution by
leveraging abundant unlabeled ECG data. In this study, we present the first
systematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG
delineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including
previously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We
adopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision,
implemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and
the transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and
cross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and
augmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our
results show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in
semi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as
a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will
facilitate further research in this domain.

Method: 定义MNN族范数，通过变换矩阵并应用核范数，无需调参即可捕捉局部和全局信息。

Result: 在Robust PCA和矩阵补全任务中，MNN提供了理论恢复保证，实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: MNN框架灵活且通用，适用于多种变换，为结构化低秩恢复提供了统一方法。

Abstract: The nuclear norm (NN) has been widely explored in matrix recovery problems,
such as Robust PCA and matrix completion, leveraging the inherent global
low-rank structure of the data. In this study, we introduce a new modified
nuclear norm (MNN) framework, where the MNN family norms are defined by
adopting suitable transformations and performing the NN on the transformed
matrix. The MNN framework offers two main advantages: (1) it jointly captures
both local information and global low-rankness without requiring trade-off
parameter tuning; (2) Under mild assumptions on the transformation, we provided
exact theoretical recovery guarantees for both Robust PCA and MC tasks-an
achievement not shared by existing methods that combine local and global
information. Thanks to its general and flexible design, MNN can accommodate
various proven transformations, enabling a unified and effective approach to
structured low-rank recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Code and supplementary material are available at

Result: GVCCS包含122个视频序列（24,228帧），提供高质量的时间分辨注释和模型评估基准。

Conclusion: 该工作为改进尾迹监测和物理模型校准奠定了基础，有助于更准确的气候影响评估。

Abstract: Aviation's climate impact includes not only CO2 emissions but also
significant non-CO2 effects, especially from contrails. These ice clouds can
alter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of
aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail
formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality
of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex
processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence.
Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras,
could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing
datasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they
typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their
source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible
Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded
with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is
individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its
lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and
includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As
reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail
analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic
segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual
contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By
providing high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for
model evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will
facilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for
more accurate climate impact understanding and assessments.

Conclusion: SGCDet通过自适应体积构建和稀疏策略实现了高效且有效的3D物体检测，仅需3D边界框监督。

Abstract: This work presents SGCDet, a novel multi-view indoor 3D object detection
framework based on adaptive 3D volume construction. Unlike previous approaches
that restrict the receptive field of voxels to fixed locations on images, we
introduce a geometry and context aware aggregation module to integrate
geometric and contextual information within adaptive regions in each image and
dynamically adjust the contributions from different views, enhancing the
representation capability of voxel features. Furthermore, we propose a sparse
volume construction strategy that adaptively identifies and selects voxels with
high occupancy probabilities for feature refinement, minimizing redundant
computation in free space. Benefiting from the above designs, our framework
achieves effective and efficient volume construction in an adaptive way. Better
still, our network can be supervised using only 3D bounding boxes, eliminating
the dependence on ground-truth scene geometry. Experimental results demonstrate
that SGCDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet, ScanNet200
and ARKitScenes datasets. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决鸟类声音分类中因环境噪声、重叠叫声和缺失标签导致的挑战，现有模型在低信噪比或多物种录音中表现不佳。

Method: 通过将频率信息嵌入声谱图（使用原色叠加）来增强物种区分，并应用深度学习模型。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在F1、ROC-AUC和CMAP指标上分别提升了7.3%、6.2%和6.6%，超越了BirdCLEF 2024冠军模型。

Conclusion: 通过颜色化嵌入频率信息能有效提升鸟类声音分类的准确性。

Abstract: We address the problem of classifying bird species using their song
recordings, a challenging task due to environmental noise, overlapping
vocalizations, and missing labels. Existing models struggle with low-SNR or
multi-species recordings. We hypothesize that birds can be classified by
visualizing their pitch pattern, speed, and repetition, collectively called
motifs. Deep learning models applied to spectrogram images help, but similar
motifs across species cause confusion. To mitigate this, we embed frequency
information into spectrograms using primary color additives. This enhances
species distinction and improves classification accuracy. Our experiments show
that the proposed approach achieves statistically significant gains over models
without colorization and surpasses the BirdCLEF 2024 winner, improving F1 by
7.3%, ROC-AUC by 6.2%, and CMAP by 6.6%. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of incorporating frequency information via colorization.

Abstract: Transferring and integrating knowledge across first-person (egocentric) and
third-person (exocentric) viewpoints is intrinsic to human intelligence,
enabling humans to learn from others and convey insights from their own
experiences. Despite rapid progress in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), their ability to perform such cross-view reasoning remains unexplored.
To address this, we introduce EgoExoBench, the first benchmark for
egocentric-exocentric video understanding and reasoning. Built from publicly
available datasets, EgoExoBench comprises over 7,300 question-answer pairs
spanning eleven sub-tasks organized into three core challenges: semantic
alignment, viewpoint association, and temporal reasoning. We evaluate 13
state-of-the-art MLLMs and find that while these models excel on single-view
tasks, they struggle to align semantics across perspectives, accurately
associate views, and infer temporal dynamics in the ego-exo context. We hope
EgoExoBench can serve as a valuable resource for research on embodied agents
and intelligent assistants seeking human-like cross-view intelligence.

Abstract: Bias in computer vision models remains a significant challenge, often
resulting in unfair, unreliable, and non-generalizable AI systems. Although
research into bias mitigation has intensified, progress continues to be
hindered by fragmented implementations and inconsistent evaluation practices.
Disparate datasets and metrics used across studies complicate reproducibility,
making it difficult to fairly assess and compare the effectiveness of various

Mitigator (VB-Mitigator), an open-source framework designed to streamline the
development, evaluation, and comparative analysis of visual bias mitigation
techniques. VB-Mitigator offers a unified research environment encompassing 12
established mitigation methods, 7 diverse benchmark datasets. A key strength of
VB-Mitigator is its extensibility, allowing for seamless integration of
additional methods, datasets, metrics, and models. VB-Mitigator aims to
accelerate research toward fairness-aware computer vision models by serving as
a foundational codebase for the research community to develop and assess their
approaches. To this end, we also recommend best evaluation practices and
provide a comprehensive performance comparison among state-of-the-art
methodologies.

Result: 在眼底血管分割任务中，GDCUnet模型在公开数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 该模块适用于具有复杂全局自相似特征的机器视觉任务。

Abstract: Deformable convolution can adaptively change the shape of convolution kernel
by learning offsets to deal with complex shape features. We propose a novel
plug and play deformable convolutional module that uses attention and
feedforward networks to learn offsets, so that the deformable patterns can
capture long-distance global features. Compared with previously existing
deformable convolutions, the proposed module learns the sub pixel displacement
field and adaptively warps the feature maps across all channels rather than
directly deforms the convolution kernel , which is equivalent to a relative
deformation of the kernel sampling grids, achieving global feature deformation
and the decoupling of kernel size and learning network. Considering that the
fundus blood vessels have globally self similar complex edges, we design a deep
learning model for fundus blood vessel segmentation, GDCUnet, based on the
proposed convolutional module. Empirical evaluations under the same
configuration and unified framework show that GDCUnet has achieved state of the
art performance on public datasets. Further ablation experiments demonstrated
that the proposed deformable convolutional module could more significantly
learn the complex features of fundus blood vessels, enhancing the model
representation and generalization capabilities.The proposed module is similar
to the interface of conventional convolution, we suggest applying it to more
machine vision tasks with complex global self similar features.

Result: 在Objaverse数据集上，MVG4D在CLIP-I、PSNR、FVD和时间效率上优于现有方法，减少了闪烁并增强细节。

Conclusion: MVG4D为从最小输入高效可控生成4D内容开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Advances in generative modeling have significantly enhanced digital content
creation, extending from 2D images to complex 3D and 4D scenes. Despite
substantial progress, producing high-fidelity and temporally consistent dynamic
4D content remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose MVG4D, a novel
framework that generates dynamic 4D content from a single still image by
combining multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D GS). At its core,
MVG4D employs an image matrix module that synthesizes temporally coherent and
spatially diverse multi-view images, providing rich supervisory signals for
downstream 3D and 4D reconstruction. These multi-view images are used to
optimize a 3D Gaussian point cloud, which is further extended into the temporal
domain via a lightweight deformation network. Our method effectively enhances
temporal consistency, geometric fidelity, and visual realism, addressing key
challenges in motion discontinuity and background degradation that affect prior
4D GS-based methods. Extensive experiments on the Objaverse dataset demonstrate
that MVG4D outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CLIP-I, PSNR, FVD, and
time efficiency. Notably, it reduces flickering artifacts and sharpens
structural details across views and time, enabling more immersive AR/VR
experiences. MVG4D sets a new direction for efficient and controllable 4D
generation from minimal inputs.

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖的一阶段架构，直接从RGB图像和文本描述生成连续坐标空间中的姿态，避免了中间表示或基于令牌的生成，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有姿态生成方法依赖中间表示或自回归模型，导致性能下降，尤其是在需要保持时间一致性的长期生成任务中。

Result: 在Penn Action和F-PHAB数据集上的实验表明，该方法在长期生成场景中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过消除中间表示和自回归模型的限制，实现了更高效和一致的长时期姿态生成。

Abstract: Current approaches to pose generation rely heavily on intermediate
representations, either through two-stage pipelines with quantization or
autoregressive models that accumulate errors during inference. This fundamental
limitation leads to degraded performance, particularly in long-term pose
generation where maintaining temporal coherence is crucial. We propose a novel
one-stage architecture that directly generates poses in continuous coordinate
space from minimal context - a single RGB image and text description - while
maintaining consistent distributions between training and inference. Our key
innovation is eliminating the need for intermediate representations or
token-based generation by operating directly on pose coordinates through a
relative movement prediction mechanism that preserves spatial relationships,
and a unified placeholder token approach that enables single-forward generation
with identical behavior during training and inference. Through extensive
experiments on Penn Action and First-Person Hand Action Benchmark (F-PHAB)
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
quantization-based and autoregressive methods, especially in long-term
generation scenarios.

Motivation: 现有方法因材料数据集简化和渲染方程限制，导致渲染结果（尤其是皮肤）的真实感不足，逆向渲染任务因缺乏约束而难以解决。

Method: 构建OpenHumanBRDF数据集，包含位移和次表面散射等材料；设计HumanMaterial模型，采用渐进式训练策略和CPR损失函数优化材料估计。

Result: 在OpenHumanBRDF数据集和真实数据上的实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过高质量数据集和渐进式训练策略，显著提升了全人体逆向渲染的真实感和材料估计的准确性。

Abstract: Full-body Human inverse rendering based on physically-based rendering aims to
acquire high-quality materials, which helps achieve photo-realistic rendering
under arbitrary illuminations. This task requires estimating multiple material
maps and usually relies on the constraint of rendering result. The absence of
constraints on the material maps makes inverse rendering an ill-posed task.
Previous works alleviated this problem by building material dataset for
training, but their simplified material data and rendering equation lead to
rendering results with limited realism, especially that of skin. To further
alleviate this problem, we construct a higher-quality dataset (OpenHumanBRDF)
based on scanned real data and statistical material data. In addition to the
normal, diffuse albedo, roughness, specular albedo, we produce displacement and
subsurface scattering to enhance the realism of rendering results, especially
for the skin. With the increase in prediction tasks for more materials, using
an end-to-end model as in the previous work struggles to balance the importance
among various material maps, and leads to model underfitting. Therefore, we
design a model (HumanMaterial) with progressive training strategy to make full
use of the supervision information of the material maps and improve the
performance of material estimation. HumanMaterial first obtain the initial
material results via three prior models, and then refine the results by a
finetuning model. Prior models estimate different material maps, and each map
has different significance for rendering results. Thus, we design a Controlled
PBR Rendering (CPR) loss, which enhances the importance of the materials to be
optimized during the training of prior models. Extensive experiments on
OpenHumanBRDF dataset and real data demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Iwin Transformer的核心组件可作为独立模块替换自注意力模块，其概念和方法对未来研究（如视频生成）具有启发意义。

Abstract: We introduce Iwin Transformer, a novel position-embedding-free hierarchical
vision transformer, which can be fine-tuned directly from low to high
resolution, through the collaboration of innovative interleaved window
attention and depthwise separable convolution. This approach uses attention to
connect distant tokens and applies convolution to link neighboring tokens,
enabling global information exchange within a single module, overcoming Swin
Transformer's limitation of requiring two consecutive blocks to approximate
global attention. Extensive experiments on visual benchmarks demonstrate that
Iwin Transformer exhibits strong competitiveness in tasks such as image
classification (87.4 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K), semantic segmentation and
video action recognition. We also validate the effectiveness of the core
component in Iwin as a standalone module that can seamlessly replace the
self-attention module in class-conditional image generation. The concepts and
methods introduced by the Iwin Transformer have the potential to inspire future
research, like Iwin 3D Attention in video generation. The code and models are

Motivation: 现有深度网络在整合拓扑连通性时，常将其强制注入为额外特征模块，导致特征空间耦合且缺乏标准化机制量化特征强度。

Method: 提出DCFFSNet，采用特征空间解耦策略，量化连通性特征与其他特征的相对强度，并构建深度连通性特征融合-分离架构。

Result: 在ISIC2018、DSB2018和MoNuSeg数据集上，DCFFSNet在所有指标上均优于现有主流方法，如Dice和IoU提升显著。

Conclusion: DCFFSNet有效解决了分割碎片化问题，实现了平滑的边缘过渡，显著提升了临床实用性。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation leverages topological connectivity theory to
enhance edge precision and regional consistency. However, existing deep
networks integrating connectivity often forcibly inject it as an additional
feature module, resulting in coupled feature spaces with no standardized
mechanism to quantify different feature strengths. To address these issues, we
propose DCFFSNet (Dual-Connectivity Feature Fusion-Separation Network). It
introduces an innovative feature space decoupling strategy. This strategy
quantifies the relative strength between connectivity features and other
features. It then builds a deep connectivity feature fusion-separation
architecture. This architecture dynamically balances multi-scale feature
expression. Experiments were conducted on the ISIC2018, DSB2018, and MoNuSeg
datasets. On ISIC2018, DCFFSNet outperformed the next best model (CMUNet) by
1.3% (Dice) and 1.2% (IoU). On DSB2018, it surpassed TransUNet by 0.7% (Dice)
and 0.9% (IoU). On MoNuSeg, it exceeded CSCAUNet by 0.8% (Dice) and 0.9% (IoU).
The results demonstrate that DCFFSNet exceeds existing mainstream methods
across all metrics. It effectively resolves segmentation fragmentation and
achieves smooth edge transitions. This significantly enhances clinical
usability.

Conclusion: V-JEPA结合3D定位辅助任务是超声视频分割的有效方法，尤其在数据有限时表现优异。

Abstract: Acquiring and annotating large datasets in ultrasound imaging is challenging
due to low contrast, high noise, and susceptibility to artefacts. This process
requires significant time and clinical expertise. Self-supervised learning
(SSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging unlabelled data to learn useful
representations, enabling improved segmentation performance when annotated data
is limited. Recent state-of-the-art developments in SSL for video data include
V-JEPA, a framework solely based on feature prediction, avoiding pixel level
reconstruction or negative samples. We hypothesise that V-JEPA is well-suited
to ultrasound imaging, as it is less sensitive to noisy pixel-level detail
while effectively leveraging temporal information. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to adopt V-JEPA for ultrasound video data.
Similar to other patch-based masking SSL techniques such as VideoMAE, V-JEPA is
well-suited to ViT-based models. However, ViTs can underperform on small
medical datasets due to lack of inductive biases, limited spatial locality and
absence of hierarchical feature learning. To improve locality understanding, we
propose a novel 3D localisation auxiliary task to improve locality in ViT
representations during V-JEPA pre-training. Our results show V-JEPA with our
auxiliary task improves segmentation performance significantly across various
frozen encoder configurations, with gains up to 3.4\% using 100\% and up to
8.35\% using only 10\% of the training data.

Conclusion: NLML-HPE是一种高效且精确的头部姿态估计方法，适用于有限训练数据场景。

Abstract: Head pose estimation (HPE) plays a critical role in various computer vision
applications such as human-computer interaction and facial recognition. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for head pose estimation with
limited training data via non-linear manifold learning called NLML-HPE. This
method is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker
decomposition) and feed forward neural networks. Unlike traditional
classification-based approaches, our method formulates head pose estimation as
a regression problem, mapping input landmarks into a continuous representation
of pose angles. To this end, our method uses tensor decomposition to split each
Euler angle (yaw, pitch, roll) to separate subspaces and models each dimension
of the underlying manifold as a cosine curve. We address two key challenges: 1.
Almost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations.
Hence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our
training set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering
the corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited
training data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an
object from facial landmarks. Once the underlying manifold for rotation around
each axis is learned, the model is very fast in predicting unseen data. Our
training and testing code is available online along with our trained models:

TL;DR: SynC框架通过重新分配语义对齐的图像-标题对，优化零样本图像描述（ZIC）中的合成数据集，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像（T2I）模型生成的合成数据中图像与标题语义不匹配的问题，避免噪声数据对模型训练的负面影响。

Method: 提出SynC框架，采用一对多映射策略和循环一致性对齐评分器，重新分配标题至最匹配的图像。

Result: 在多个标准基准测试（MS-COCO、Flickr30k、NoCaps）上显著提升ZIC模型性能，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: SynC为优化合成数据提供了一种有效策略，显著提升了零样本图像描述任务的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot Image Captioning (ZIC) increasingly utilizes synthetic datasets
generated by text-to-image (T2I) models to mitigate the need for costly manual
annotation. However, these T2I models often produce images that exhibit
semantic misalignments with their corresponding input captions (e.g., missing
objects, incorrect attributes), resulting in noisy synthetic image-caption
pairs that can hinder model training. Existing dataset pruning techniques are
largely designed for removing noisy text in web-crawled data. However, these
methods are ill-suited for the distinct challenges of synthetic data, where
captions are typically well-formed, but images may be inaccurate
representations. To address this gap, we introduce SynC, a novel framework
specifically designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets for ZIC.
Instead of conventional filtering or regeneration, SynC focuses on reassigning
captions to the most semantically aligned images already present within the
synthetic image pool. Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by
initially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We
then apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best
image by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via
image-to-text retrieval. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SynC
consistently and significantly improves performance across various ZIC models
on standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art
results in several scenarios. SynC offers an effective strategy for curating
refined synthetic data to enhance ZIC.

Result: 方法在多数基准数据集上达到最优性能，训练数据量减少30%，计算效率显著提升。

Conclusion: 该框架为VPR提供了鲁棒的全局嵌入，适应环境变化并提升效率。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is crucial for robust mobile robot
localization, yet it faces significant challenges in maintaining reliable
performance under varying environmental conditions and viewpoints. To address
this, we propose a novel framework that integrates Dual-Scale-Former
(DSFormer), a Transformer-based cross-learning module, with an innovative block
clustering strategy. DSFormer enhances feature representation by enabling
bidirectional information transfer between dual-scale features extracted from
the final two CNN layers, capturing both semantic richness and spatial details
through self-attention for long-range dependencies within each scale and shared
cross-attention for cross-scale learning. Complementing this, our block
clustering strategy repartitions the widely used San Francisco eXtra Large
(SF-XL) training dataset from multiple distinct perspectives, optimizing data
organization to further bolster robustness against viewpoint variations.
Together, these innovations not only yield a robust global embedding adaptable
to environmental changes but also reduce the required training data volume by
approximately 30\% compared to previous partitioning methods. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
across most benchmark datasets, surpassing advanced reranking methods like
DELG, Patch-NetVLAD, TransVPR, and R2Former as a global retrieval solution
using 512-dim global descriptors, while significantly improving computational
efficiency.

Abstract: Understanding a driver's behavior and intentions is important for potential
risk assessment and early accident prevention. Safety and driver assistance
systems can be tailored to individual drivers' behavior, significantly
enhancing their effectiveness. However, existing datasets are limited in
describing and explaining general vehicle movements based on external visual
evidence. This paper introduces a benchmark, PDB-Eval, for a detailed
understanding of Personalized Driver Behavior, and aligning Large Multimodal
Models (MLLMs) with driving comprehension and reasoning. Our benchmark consists
of two main components, PDB-X and PDB-QA. PDB-X can evaluate MLLMs'
understanding of temporal driving scenes. Our dataset is designed to find valid
visual evidence from the external view to explain the driver's behavior from
the internal view. To align MLLMs' reasoning abilities with driving tasks, we
propose PDB-QA as a visual explanation question-answering task for MLLM
instruction fine-tuning. As a generic learning task for generative models like
MLLMs, PDB-QA can bridge the domain gap without harming MLLMs'
generalizability. Our evaluation indicates that fine-tuning MLLMs on
fine-grained descriptions and explanations can effectively bridge the gap
between MLLMs and the driving domain, which improves zero-shot performance on
question-answering tasks by up to 73.2%. We further evaluate the MLLMs
fine-tuned on PDB-X in Brain4Cars' intention prediction and AIDE's recognition
tasks. We observe up to 12.5% performance improvements on the turn intention
prediction task in Brain4Cars, and consistent performance improvements up to
11.0% on all tasks in AIDE.

Conclusion: 该框架促进了公平比较和加速研究，并提供了对实际LiDAR感知对抗鲁棒性的深入理解。

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in LiDAR-based 3D object detection is a critical
research area due to its widespread application in real-world scenarios. While
many digital attacks manipulate point clouds or meshes, they often lack
physical realizability, limiting their practical impact. Physical adversarial
object attacks remain underexplored and suffer from poor reproducibility due to
inconsistent setups and hardware differences. To address this, we propose a
device-agnostic, standardized framework that abstracts key elements of physical
adversarial object attacks, supports diverse methods, and provides open-source
code with benchmarking protocols in simulation and real-world settings. Our
framework enables fair comparison, accelerates research, and is validated by
successfully transferring simulated attacks to a physical LiDAR system. Beyond
the framework, we offer insights into factors influencing attack success and
advance understanding of adversarial robustness in real-world LiDAR perception.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication plays a crucial role in autonomous
driving, enabling cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure. While
simulation has significantly contributed to various autonomous driving tasks,
its potential for data generation and augmentation in V2X scenarios remains
underexplored. In this paper, we introduce CRUISE, a comprehensive
reconstruction-and-synthesis framework designed for V2X driving environments.
CRUISE employs decomposed Gaussian Splatting to accurately reconstruct
real-world scenes while supporting flexible editing. By decomposing dynamic
traffic participants into editable Gaussian representations, CRUISE allows for
seamless modification and augmentation of driving scenes. Furthermore, the
framework renders images from both ego-vehicle and infrastructure views,
enabling large-scale V2X dataset augmentation for training and evaluation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that: 1) CRUISE reconstructs real-world V2X
driving scenes with high fidelity; 2) using CRUISE improves 3D detection across
ego-vehicle, infrastructure, and cooperative views, as well as cooperative 3D
tracking on the V2X-Seq benchmark; and 3) CRUISE effectively generates
challenging corner cases.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in medical images is an important yet challenging task due
to the diversity of possible anomalies and the practical impossibility of
collecting comprehensively annotated data sets. In this work, we tackle
unsupervised medical anomaly detection proposing a modernized autoencoder-based
framework, the Q-Former Autoencoder, that leverages state-of-the-art pretrained
vision foundation models, such as DINO, DINOv2 and Masked Autoencoder. Instead
of training encoders from scratch, we directly utilize frozen vision foundation
models as feature extractors, enabling rich, multi-stage, high-level
representations without domain-specific fine-tuning. We propose the usage of
the Q-Former architecture as the bottleneck, which enables the control of the
length of the reconstruction sequence, while efficiently aggregating multiscale
features. Additionally, we incorporate a perceptual loss computed using
features from a pretrained Masked Autoencoder, guiding the reconstruction
towards semantically meaningful structures. Our framework is evaluated on four
diverse medical anomaly detection benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
results on BraTS2021, RESC, and RSNA. Our results highlight the potential of
vision foundation model encoders, pretrained on natural images, to generalize
effectively to medical image analysis tasks without further fine-tuning. We

countries. Deep learning-based object detection methods have demonstrated
strong potential for automated Malaria diagnosis, but their adoption is limited
by the scarcity of datasets with detailed instance-level annotations. In this
work, we present an enhanced version of the publicly available NIH malaria
dataset, with detailed bounding box annotations in COCO format to support
object detection training. We validated the revised annotations by training a
Faster R-CNN model to detect infected and non-infected red blood cells, as well
as white blood cells. Cross-validation on the original dataset yielded F1
scores of up to 0.88 for infected cell detection. These results underscore the
importance of annotation volume and consistency, and demonstrate that automated
annotation refinement combined with targeted manual correction can produce
training data of sufficient quality for robust detection performance. The
updated annotations set is publicly available via GitHub:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种主动防御框架Rein-EAD，通过自适应探索与环境交互提升3D对抗环境下的感知鲁棒性，显著降低攻击成功率并保持标准准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D环境中的对抗攻击对视觉感知系统的可靠性构成威胁，现有被动防御方法依赖预设假设，适应性不足。

Method: 提出Rein-EAD框架，结合多步目标优化和不确定性导向的奖励机制，实现高效策略更新。

Result: 实验表明Rein-EAD显著降低攻击成功率，保持标准准确性，并能泛化至未见过的攻击。

Conclusion: Rein-EAD是一种适用于复杂3D任务的主动防御框架，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in 3D environments have emerged as a critical threat to
the reliability of visual perception systems, particularly in safety-sensitive
applications such as identity verification and autonomous driving. These
attacks employ adversarial patches and 3D objects to manipulate deep neural
network (DNN) predictions by exploiting vulnerabilities within complex scenes.
Existing defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training and purification,
primarily employ passive strategies to enhance robustness. However, these
approaches often rely on pre-defined assumptions about adversarial tactics,
limiting their adaptability in dynamic 3D settings. To address these
challenges, we introduce Reinforced Embodied Active Defense (Rein-EAD), a
proactive defense framework that leverages adaptive exploration and interaction
with the environment to improve perception robustness in 3D adversarial
contexts. By implementing a multi-step objective that balances immediate
prediction accuracy with predictive entropy minimization, Rein-EAD optimizes
defense strategies over a multi-step horizon. Additionally, Rein-EAD involves
an uncertainty-oriented reward-shaping mechanism that facilitates efficient
policy updates, thereby reducing computational overhead and supporting
real-world applicability without the need for differentiable environments.
Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Rein-EAD, demonstrating
a substantial reduction in attack success rates while preserving standard
accuracy across diverse tasks. Notably, Rein-EAD exhibits robust generalization
to unseen and adaptive attacks, making it suitable for real-world complex
tasks, including 3D object classification, face recognition and autonomous
driving.

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving are moving towards mapless approaches,
where High-Definition (HD) maps are generated online directly from sensor data,
reducing the need for expensive labeling and maintenance. However, the
reliability of these online-generated maps remains uncertain. While
incorporating map uncertainty into downstream trajectory prediction tasks has
shown potential for performance improvements, current strategies provide
limited insights into the specific scenarios where this uncertainty is
beneficial. In this work, we first analyze the driving scenarios in which
mapping uncertainty has the greatest positive impact on trajectory prediction
and identify a critical, previously overlooked factor: the agent's kinematic
state. Building on these insights, we propose a novel Proprioceptive Scenario
Gating that adaptively integrates map uncertainty into trajectory prediction
based on forecasts of the ego vehicle's future kinematics. This lightweight,
self-supervised approach enhances the synergy between online mapping and
trajectory prediction, providing interpretability around where uncertainty is
advantageous and outperforming previous integration methods. Additionally, we
introduce a Covariance-based Map Uncertainty approach that better aligns with
map geometry, further improving trajectory prediction. Extensive ablation
studies confirm the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 23.6%
improvement in mapless trajectory prediction performance over the
state-of-the-art method using the real-world nuScenes driving dataset. Our
code, data, and models are publicly available at

Abstract: In goal-directed visual tasks, human perception is guided by both top-down
and bottom-up cues. At the same time, foveal vision plays a crucial role in
directing attention efficiently. Modern research on bio-inspired computational
attention models has taken advantage of advancements in deep learning by
utilizing human scanpath data to achieve new state-of-the-art performance. In
this work, we assess the performance of SemBA-FAST, i.e. Semantic-based
Bayesian Attention for Foveal Active visual Search Tasks, a top-down framework
designed for predicting human visual attention in target-present visual search.
SemBA-FAST integrates deep object detection with a probabilistic semantic
fusion mechanism to generate attention maps dynamically, leveraging pre-trained
detectors and artificial foveation to update top-down knowledge and improve
fixation prediction sequentially. We evaluate SemBA-FAST on the COCO-Search18
benchmark dataset, comparing its performance against other scanpath prediction
models. Our methodology achieves fixation sequences that closely match human
ground-truth scanpaths. Notably, it surpasses baseline and other top-down
approaches and competes, in some cases, with scanpath-informed models. These
findings provide valuable insights into the capabilities of semantic-foveal
probabilistic frameworks for human-like attention modelling, with implications
for real-time cognitive computing and robotics.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful technique for
extracting human-interpretable features from neural networks activations.
Previous works compared different models based on SAE-derived features but
those comparisons have been restricted to models within the same modality. We
propose a novel indicator allowing quantitative comparison of models across SAE
features, and use it to conduct a comparative study of visual, textual and
multimodal encoders. We also propose to quantify the Comparative Sharedness of
individual features between different classes of models. With these two new
tools, we conduct several studies on 21 encoders of the three types, with two
significantly different sizes, and considering generalist and domain specific
datasets. The results allow to revisit previous studies at the light of
encoders trained in a multimodal context and to quantify to which extent all
these models share some representations or features. They also suggest that
visual features that are specific to VLMs among vision encoders are shared with
text encoders, highlighting the impact of text pretraining. The code is

Abstract: Object detection is one of the main applications of computer vision in remote
sensing imagery. Despite its increasing availability, the sheer volume of
remote sensing data poses a challenge when detecting rare objects across large
geographic areas. Paradoxically, this common challenge is crucial to many
applications, such as estimating environmental impact of certain human
activities at scale. In this paper, we propose to address the problem by
investigating the methane production and emissions of bio-digesters in France.
We first introduce a novel dataset containing bio-digesters, with small
training and validation sets, and a large test set with a high imbalance
towards observations without objects since such sites are rare. We develop a
part-based method that considers essential bio-digester sub-elements to boost
initial detections. To this end, we apply our method to new, unseen regions to
build an inventory of bio-digesters. We then compute geostatistical estimates
of the quantity of methane produced that can be attributed to these
infrastructures in a given area at a given time.

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of semantic object segmentation using
foundation models. We investigate whether foundation models, trained on a large
number and variety of objects, can perform object segmentation without
fine-tuning on specific images containing everyday objects, but in highly
cluttered visual scenes. The ''in the wild'' context is driven by the target
application of vision guided upper limb neuroprostheses. We propose a method
for generating prompts based on gaze fixations to guide the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) in our segmentation scenario, and fine-tune it on egocentric visual
data. Evaluation results of our approach show an improvement of the IoU
segmentation quality metric by up to 0.51 points on real-world challenging data

Result: 在多种传感器组合下表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GaussianFusionOcc通过多模态融合和高斯表示，实现了高效且精确的占用预测。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is one of the crucial tasks of autonomous
driving. It enables precise and safe interpretation and navigation in complex
environments. Reliable predictions rely on effective sensor fusion, as
different modalities can contain complementary information. Unlike conventional
methods that depend on dense grid representations, our approach,
GaussianFusionOcc, uses semantic 3D Gaussians alongside an innovative sensor
fusion mechanism. Seamless integration of data from camera, LiDAR, and radar
sensors enables more precise and scalable occupancy prediction, while 3D
Gaussian representation significantly improves memory efficiency and inference
speed. GaussianFusionOcc employs modality-agnostic deformable attention to
extract essential features from each sensor type, which are then used to refine
Gaussian properties, resulting in a more accurate representation of the
environment. Extensive testing with various sensor combinations demonstrates
the versatility of our approach. By leveraging the robustness of multi-modal
fusion and the efficiency of Gaussian representation, GaussianFusionOcc
outperforms current state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: IntentVCNet有效提升了模型在视频序列中建模空间细节和生成意图导向描述的能力。

Abstract: Intent-oriented controlled video captioning aims to generate targeted
descriptions for specific targets in a video based on customized user intent.
Current Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained strong instruction
following and visual comprehension capabilities. Although the LVLMs
demonstrated proficiency in spatial and temporal understanding respectively, it
was not able to perform fine-grained spatial control in time sequences in
direct response to instructions. This substantial spatio-temporal gap
complicates efforts to achieve fine-grained intention-oriented control in
video. Towards this end, we propose a novel IntentVCNet that unifies the
temporal and spatial understanding knowledge inherent in LVLMs to bridge the
spatio-temporal gap from both prompting and model perspectives. Specifically,
we first propose a prompt combination strategy designed to enable LLM to model
the implicit relationship between prompts that characterize user intent and
video sequences. We then propose a parameter efficient box adapter that
augments the object semantic information in the global visual context so that
the visual token has a priori information about the user intent. The final
experiment proves that the combination of the two strategies can further
enhance the LVLM's ability to model spatial details in video sequences, and
facilitate the LVLMs to accurately generate controlled intent-oriented
captions. Our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results in several open
source LVLMs and was the runner-up in the IntentVC challenge. Our code is

Method: 提出EDA，扩展噪声模式的自由度，同时保持EDM的模块灵活性，并证明噪声复杂性增加不会带来额外计算开销。

Result: EDA在MRI偏置场校正、CT金属伪影减少和自然图像阴影去除任务中表现优异，仅需5次采样步骤即可超越大多数任务专用方法。

Conclusion: EDA通过扩展噪声模式的设计空间，显著提升了图像恢复任务的性能，成为相关领域的先进方法。

Abstract: EDM elucidates the unified design space of diffusion models, yet its fixed
noise patterns restricted to pure Gaussian noise, limit advancements in image
restoration. Our study indicates that forcibly injecting Gaussian noise
corrupts the degraded images, overextends the image transformation distance,
and increases restoration complexity. To address this problem, our proposed EDA
Elucidates the Design space of Arbitrary-noise-based diffusion models.
Theoretically, EDA expands the freedom of noise pattern while preserving the
original module flexibility of EDM, with rigorous proof that increased noise
complexity incurs no additional computational overhead during restoration. EDA
is validated on three typical tasks: MRI bias field correction (global smooth
noise), CT metal artifact reduction (global sharp noise), and natural image
shadow removal (local boundary-aware noise). With only 5 sampling steps, EDA
outperforms most task-specific methods and achieves state-of-the-art

Abstract: Scaling visual generation models is essential for real-world content
creation, yet requires substantial training and computational expenses.
Alternatively, test-time scaling has garnered growing attention due to resource
efficiency and promising performance. In this work, we present TTS-VAR, the
first general test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive (VAR)
models, modeling the generation process as a path searching problem. To
dynamically balance computational efficiency with exploration capacity, we
first introduce an adaptive descending batch size schedule throughout the
causal generation process. Besides, inspired by VAR's hierarchical
coarse-to-fine multi-scale generation, our framework integrates two key
components: (i) At coarse scales, we observe that generated tokens are hard for
evaluation, possibly leading to erroneous acceptance of inferior samples or
rejection of superior samples. Noticing that the coarse scales contain
sufficient structural information, we propose clustering-based diversity
search. It preserves structural variety through semantic feature clustering,
enabling later selection on samples with higher potential. (ii) In fine scales,
resampling-based potential selection prioritizes promising candidates using
potential scores, which are defined as reward functions incorporating
multi-scale generation history. Experiments on the powerful VAR model Infinity
show a notable 8.7% GenEval score improvement (from 0.69 to 0.75). Key insights
reveal that early-stage structural features effectively influence final
quality, and resampling efficacy varies across generation scales. Code is

Result: 在Waymo和KITTI数据集上实现了高精度的无姿态重建，达到了新的技术标准。

Conclusion: 该方法通过联合优化和概率映射策略，显著提升了无姿态3DGS重建的效率和精度。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a core technique for 3D
representation. Its effectiveness largely depends on precise camera poses and
accurate point cloud initialization, which are often derived from pretrained
Multi-View Stereo (MVS) models. However, in unposed reconstruction task from
hundreds of outdoor images, existing MVS models may struggle with memory limits
and lose accuracy as the number of input images grows. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel unposed 3DGS reconstruction framework that
integrates pretrained MVS priors with the probabilistic Procrustes mapping
strategy. The method partitions input images into subsets, maps submaps into a
global space, and jointly optimizes geometry and poses with 3DGS. Technically,
we formulate the mapping of tens of millions of point clouds as a probabilistic
Procrustes problem and solve a closed-form alignment. By employing
probabilistic coupling along with a soft dustbin mechanism to reject uncertain
correspondences, our method globally aligns point clouds and poses within
minutes across hundreds of images. Moreover, we propose a joint optimization
framework for 3DGS and camera poses. It constructs Gaussians from
confidence-aware anchor points and integrates 3DGS differentiable rendering
with an analytical Jacobian to jointly refine scene and poses, enabling
accurate reconstruction and pose estimation. Experiments on Waymo and KITTI
datasets show that our method achieves accurate reconstruction from unposed
image sequences, setting a new state of the art for unposed 3DGS
reconstruction.

Abstract: Intraoperative registration of real-time ultrasound (iUS) to preoperative
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains an unsolved problem due to severe
modality-specific differences in appearance, resolution, and field-of-view. To
address this, we propose a novel 3D cross-modal keypoint descriptor for MRI-iUS
matching and registration. Our approach employs a patient-specific
matching-by-synthesis approach, generating synthetic iUS volumes from
preoperative MRI. This enables supervised contrastive training to learn a
shared descriptor space.
  A probabilistic keypoint detection strategy is then employed to identify
anatomically salient and modality-consistent locations. During training, a
curriculum-based triplet loss with dynamic hard negative mining is used to
learn descriptors that are i) robust to iUS artifacts such as speckle noise and
limited coverage, and ii) rotation-invariant . At inference, the method detects
keypoints in MR and real iUS images and identifies sparse matches, which are
then used to perform rigid registration. Our approach is evaluated using 3D
MRI-iUS pairs from the ReMIND dataset. Experiments show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art keypoint matching methods across 11 patients, with
an average precision of $69.8\%$. For image registration, our method achieves a
competitive mean Target Registration Error of 2.39 mm on the ReMIND2Reg
benchmark.
  Compared to existing iUS-MR registration approach, our framework is
interpretable, requires no manual initialization, and shows robustness to iUS
field-of-view variation. Code is available at

Conclusion: VideoMind为细粒度跨模态对齐和深度视频理解任务提供了强大基准，数据已公开。

Abstract: This paper introduces VideoMind, a video-centric omni-modal dataset designed
for deep video content cognition and enhanced multi-modal feature
representation. The dataset comprises 103K video samples (3K reserved for
testing), each paired with audio and systematically detailed textual
descriptions. Specifically, every video and its audio is described across three
hierarchical layers (factual, abstract, and intent), progressing from surface
to depth. It contains over 22 million words, averaging ~225 words per sample.
VideoMind's key distinction from existing datasets is its provision of intent
expressions, which require contextual integration across the entire video and
are not directly observable. These deep-cognitive expressions are generated
using a Chain-of-Thought (COT) approach, prompting the mLLM through
step-by-step reasoning. Each description includes annotations for subject,
place, time, event, action, and intent, supporting downstream recognition
tasks. Crucially, we establish a gold-standard benchmark with 3,000 manually
validated samples for evaluating deep-cognitive video understanding. We design
hybrid-cognitive retrieval experiments, scored by multi-level retrieval
metrics, to appropriately assess deep video comprehension. Evaluation results
for models (e.g., InternVideo, VAST, UMT-L) are released. VideoMind serves as a
powerful benchmark for fine-grained cross-modal alignment and advances fields
requiring in-depth video understanding, such as emotion and intent recognition.

Abstract: The poultry industry has been driven by broiler chicken production and has
grown into the world's largest animal protein sector. Automated detection of
chicken carcasses on processing lines is vital for quality control, food
safety, and operational efficiency in slaughterhouses and poultry processing
plants. However, developing robust deep learning models for tasks like instance
segmentation in these fast-paced industrial environments is often hampered by
the need for laborious acquisition and annotation of large-scale real-world
image datasets. We present the first pipeline generating photo-realistic,
automatically labeled synthetic images of chicken carcasses. We also introduce
a new benchmark dataset containing 300 annotated real-world images, curated
specifically for poultry segmentation research. Using these datasets, this
study investigates the efficacy of synthetic data and automatic data annotation
to enhance the instance segmentation of chicken carcasses, particularly when
real annotated data from the processing line is scarce. A small real dataset
with varying proportions of synthetic images was evaluated in prominent
instance segmentation models. Results show that synthetic data significantly
boosts segmentation performance for chicken carcasses across all models. This
research underscores the value of synthetic data augmentation as a viable and
effective strategy to mitigate data scarcity, reduce manual annotation efforts,
and advance the development of robust AI-driven automated detection systems for
chicken carcasses in the poultry processing industry.

Motivation: 提升定向广告活动的效果，通过联合学习年龄和性别信息，利用面部特征的关联性。

Method: 设计自定义CNN架构，联合学习年龄和性别任务，使用大规模多样化数据集，并进行数据预处理以提高鲁棒性。

Result: 性别分类准确率95%，年龄估计平均绝对误差5.77岁，发现对年轻个体的年龄估计存在挑战。

Conclusion: 需针对年轻个体进行数据增强和模型优化，同时探索不同CNN架构和超参数对性能的影响。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning-based approach for simultaneous age
and gender classification from facial images, designed to enhance the
effectiveness of targeted advertising campaigns. We propose a custom
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, optimized for both tasks,
which leverages the inherent correlation between age and gender information
present in facial features. Unlike existing methods that often treat these
tasks independently, our model learns shared representations, leading to
improved performance. The network is trained on a large, diverse dataset of
facial images, carefully pre-processed to ensure robustness against variations
in lighting, pose, and image quality. Our experimental results demonstrate a
significant improvement in gender classification accuracy, achieving 95%, and a
competitive mean absolute error of 5.77 years for age estimation. Critically,
we analyze the performance across different age groups, identifying specific
challenges in accurately estimating the age of younger individuals. This
analysis reveals the need for targeted data augmentation and model refinement
to address these biases. Furthermore, we explore the impact of different CNN
architectures and hyperparameter settings on the overall performance, providing
valuable insights for future research.

*Nitish Shukla,Arun Ross*

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的去变形方法，能够分解潜在空间中的变形图像，克服现有方法的局限性，并在真实和合成面部变形上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去变形方法存在变形复制问题，且假设训练和测试使用相同的变形技术，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 通过在潜在空间分解变形图像，支持对未知变形技术和面部风格的去变形处理。

Result: 在真实和合成面部变形上表现优异，显著优于现有方法，生成高保真去变形图像。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了变形复制问题，支持多种变形技术，为去变形提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: A morph is created by combining two (or more) face images from two (or more)
identities to create a composite image that is highly similar to both
constituent identities, allowing the forged morph to be biometrically
associated with more than one individual. Morph Attack Detection (MAD) can be
used to detect a morph, but does not reveal the constituent images. Demorphing
- the process of deducing the constituent images - is thus vital to provide
additional evidence about a morph. Existing demorphing methods suffer from the
morph replication problem, where the outputs tend to look very similar to the
morph itself, or assume that train and test morphs are generated using the same
morph technique. The proposed method overcomes these issues. The method
decomposes a morph in latent space allowing it to demorph images created from
unseen morph techniques and face styles. We train our method on morphs created
from synthetic faces and test on morphs created from real faces using arbitrary
morph techniques. Our method outperforms existing methods by a considerable
margin and produces high fidelity demorphed face images.

TL;DR: DMDX通过对抗性蒸馏和分布匹配改进DMD，解决了模式崩溃问题，提升了单步和多步生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DMD依赖反向KL散度可能导致模式崩溃，需改进以提升生成效果。

Method: 提出ADM框架，利用扩散判别器对抗性对齐潜在预测；结合对抗性蒸馏预训练和ADM微调为DMDX。

Result: DMDX在SDXL上单步性能优于DMD2，GPU时间更少；在多步蒸馏中为图像和视频合成设新标杆。

Conclusion: DMDX通过对抗性策略显著提升生成效率和质量，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) is a promising score distillation
technique that compresses pre-trained teacher diffusion models into efficient
one-step or multi-step student generators. Nevertheless, its reliance on the
reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization potentially induces mode
collapse (or mode-seeking) in certain applications. To circumvent this inherent
drawback, we propose Adversarial Distribution Matching (ADM), a novel framework
that leverages diffusion-based discriminators to align the latent predictions
between real and fake score estimators for score distillation in an adversarial
manner. In the context of extremely challenging one-step distillation, we
further improve the pre-trained generator by adversarial distillation with
hybrid discriminators in both latent and pixel spaces. Different from the mean
squared error used in DMD2 pre-training, our method incorporates the
distributional loss on ODE pairs collected from the teacher model, and thus
providing a better initialization for score distillation fine-tuning in the
next stage. By combining the adversarial distillation pre-training with ADM
fine-tuning into a unified pipeline termed DMDX, our proposed method achieves
superior one-step performance on SDXL compared to DMD2 while consuming less GPU
time. Additional experiments that apply multi-step ADM distillation on
SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Large, and CogVideoX set a new benchmark towards efficient
image and video synthesis.

TL;DR: 提出HybridTM，结合Transformer和Mamba的混合架构，用于3D语义分割，通过Inner Layer Hybrid Strategy同时捕捉长距离依赖和局部特征，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在3D语义分割中表现强大但计算复杂度高，Mamba计算高效但特征提取能力不足，结合两者优势是未解决的挑战。

Method: 提出HybridTM混合架构和Inner Layer Hybrid Strategy，结合Transformer和Mamba的注意力机制与线性复杂度。

Result: 在ScanNet、ScanNet200和nuScenes等数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: HybridTM有效结合了Transformer和Mamba的优势，提升了3D语义分割的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D
semantic segmentation through their powerful attention mechanisms, but the
quadratic complexity limits their modeling of long-range dependencies in
large-scale point clouds. While recent Mamba-based approaches offer efficient
processing with linear complexity, they struggle with feature representation
when extracting 3D features. However, effectively combining these complementary
strengths remains an open challenge in this field. In this paper, we propose
HybridTM, the first hybrid architecture that integrates Transformer and Mamba
for 3D semantic segmentation. In addition, we propose the Inner Layer Hybrid
Strategy, which combines attention and Mamba at a finer granularity, enabling
simultaneous capture of long-range dependencies and fine-grained local
features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of our HybridTM on diverse indoor and outdoor datasets.
Furthermore, our HybridTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet,
ScanNet200, and nuScenes benchmarks. The code will be made available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光图像增强在极端光照退化下难以保持边缘连续性和细节，需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 提出DRWKV模型，结合GER理论、Evolving WKV Attention和Bi-SAB模块，并设计MS2-Loss。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，DRWKV在PSNR、SSIM和NIQE上表现领先，且计算复杂度低。

Conclusion: DRWKV不仅提升了图像增强效果，还在低光多目标跟踪任务中展示了泛化能力。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in
preserving object edge continuity and fine structural details under extreme
illumination degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel model, DRWKV
(Detailed Receptance Weighted Key Value), which integrates our proposed Global
Edge Retinex (GER) theory, enabling effective decoupling of illumination and
edge structures for enhanced edge fidelity. Secondly, we introduce Evolving WKV
Attention, a spiral-scanning mechanism that captures spatial edge continuity
and models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design the
Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align
luminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating
artifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV
achieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low
computational complexity. Furthermore, DRWKV enhances downstream performance in
low-light multi-object tracking tasks, validating its generalization
capabilities.

TL;DR: Scenethesis是一种基于领域特定语言的3D软件合成方法，通过细粒度约束感知中间表示实现用户需求与生成软件之间的形式化可追溯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D软件生成方法无法修改特定元素且难以处理复杂空间和语义约束，Scenethesis旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 基于ScenethesisLang（一种领域特定语言），将3D软件合成分解为多个阶段，支持独立验证、目标修改和系统约束满足。

Result: Scenethesis准确捕获80%以上用户需求，满足90%以上硬约束，并在视觉评估中比现有方法提升42.8%。

Conclusion: Scenethesis通过形式化约束表达和细粒度控制，显著提升了3D软件生成的灵活性和准确性。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (UI) software has undergone a fundamental
transformation from traditional two-dimensional (2D) desktop/web/mobile
interfaces to spatial three-dimensional (3D) environments. While existing work
has made remarkable success in automated 2D software generation, such as
HTML/CSS and mobile app interface code synthesis, the generation of 3D software
still remains under-explored. Current methods for 3D software generation
usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control
specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to
handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world.
To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel
requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal
traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis
is built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a
granular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural
language requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a
comprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of
3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification
language capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D
software synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis
enables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic
constraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis
accurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90%
of hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously.
Furthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual
evaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIDA提出了一种利用合成图像进行零样本域适应的高效方法，通过生成目标域风格的合成图像并引入Domain Mix和Patch Style Transfer模块，显著提升了适应效果和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于文本描述的零样本域适应方法难以捕捉复杂现实变化且耗时较长，因此探索利用图像数据提供更细粒度的风格线索。

Method: 通过生成源域风格的详细图像并应用图像翻译生成目标域风格的合成图像，利用Domain Mix和Patch Style Transfer模块建模现实变化。

Result: 在多样化的零样本适应场景中，特别是挑战性领域，SIDA表现出最先进的性能，并显著减少了适应时间。

Conclusion: SIDA通过合成图像和创新的风格建模模块，实现了高效且有效的零样本域适应。

Abstract: Zero-shot domain adaptation is a method for adapting a model to a target
domain without utilizing target domain image data. To enable adaptation without
target images, existing studies utilize CLIP's embedding space and text
description to simulate target-like style features. Despite the previous
achievements in zero-shot domain adaptation, we observe that these text-driven
methods struggle to capture complex real-world variations and significantly
increase adaptation time due to their alignment process. Instead of relying on
text descriptions, we explore solutions leveraging image data, which provides
diverse and more fine-grained style cues. In this work, we propose SIDA, a
novel and efficient zero-shot domain adaptation method leveraging synthetic
images. To generate synthetic images, we first create detailed, source-like
images and apply image translation to reflect the style of the target domain.
We then utilize the style features of these synthetic images as a proxy for the
target domain. Based on these features, we introduce Domain Mix and Patch Style
Transfer modules, which enable effective modeling of real-world variations. In
particular, Domain Mix blends multiple styles to expand the intra-domain
representations, and Patch Style Transfer assigns different styles to
individual patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by showing
state-of-the-art performance in diverse zero-shot adaptation scenarios,
particularly in challenging domains. Moreover, our approach achieves high
efficiency by significantly reducing the overall adaptation time.

Motivation: 研究文本到图像模型中明确命名艺术家的使用，并开发一个基准测试以促进负责任的模型使用。

Method: 构建包含110位艺术家的1.95M图像数据集，评估特征相似性基线、对比风格描述符、数据归因方法、监督分类器和少样本原型网络。

Result: 监督和少样本模型在已知艺术家和复杂提示下表现最佳，风格描述符在艺术家风格显著时表现更好，多艺术家提示最具挑战性。

Conclusion: 基准测试揭示了改进空间，并提供了公开数据集以推动文本到图像模型的负责任使用。

Abstract: A common and controversial use of text-to-image models is to generate
pictures by explicitly naming artists, such as "in the style of Greg
Rutkowski". We introduce a benchmark for prompted-artist recognition:
predicting which artist names were invoked in the prompt from the image alone.
The dataset contains 1.95M images covering 110 artists and spans four
generalization settings: held-out artists, increasing prompt complexity,
multiple-artist prompts, and different text-to-image models. We evaluate
feature similarity baselines, contrastive style descriptors, data attribution
methods, supervised classifiers, and few-shot prototypical networks.
Generalization patterns vary: supervised and few-shot models excel on seen
artists and complex prompts, whereas style descriptors transfer better when the
artist's style is pronounced; multi-artist prompts remain the most challenging.
Our benchmark reveals substantial headroom and provides a public testbed to
advance the responsible moderation of text-to-image models. We release the
dataset and benchmark to foster further research:

Motivation: 解决长范围叙事和视觉一致性的短电影自动生成问题。

Method: 采用自上而下的关键帧规划和自下而上的视频合成，结合多模态扩散变换器（MM-DiT）进行训练。

Result: 实验表明，Captain Cinema能高效生成视觉连贯且叙事一致的短电影。

Conclusion: 该框架为高质量短电影生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present Captain Cinema, a generation framework for short movie generation.
Given a detailed textual description of a movie storyline, our approach firstly
generates a sequence of keyframes that outline the entire narrative, which
ensures long-range coherence in both the storyline and visual appearance (e.g.,
scenes and characters). We refer to this step as top-down keyframe planning.
These keyframes then serve as conditioning signals for a video synthesis model,
which supports long context learning, to produce the spatio-temporal dynamics
between them. This step is referred to as bottom-up video synthesis. To support
stable and efficient generation of multi-scene long narrative cinematic works,
we introduce an interleaved training strategy for Multimodal Diffusion
Transformers (MM-DiT), specifically adapted for long-context video data. Our
model is trained on a specially curated cinematic dataset consisting of
interleaved data pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that Captain Cinema
performs favorably in the automated creation of visually coherent and narrative
consistent short movies in high quality and efficiency. Project page:

TL;DR: 该研究利用符号回归（SR）和答案集编程（ASP）的混合框架，从数值模拟数据中推导出可解释的数学关系，用于建模3D不可压缩流动，并验证其与解析解的吻合性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在流体力学中，理解流动物理机制与准确预测同样重要，而传统机器学习方法缺乏可解释性，因此研究采用SR来揭示复杂物理系统的数学关系。

Method: 使用PySR库从数值模拟数据中推导符号方程，并结合ASP框架确保方程的物理合理性。

Result: 推导的符号方程不仅近似了抛物线速度分布和压力降，还与文献中的解析解完全吻合。

Conclusion: 研究展示了SR简化复杂流动行为的能力，以及知识表示方法提升数据驱动模型可靠性的潜力。

Abstract: Unlike conventional Machine-Learning (ML) approaches, often criticized as
"black boxes", Symbolic Regression (SR) stands out as a powerful tool for
revealing interpretable mathematical relationships in complex physical systems,
requiring no a priori assumptions about models' structures. Motivated by the
recognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow
physics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a
fundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular
channel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar
conditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were
derived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics
of the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic
velocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also
perfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore,
we propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the
knowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining
the generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The
proposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic
expressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible,
adhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key
contributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise,
interpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation
approaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models
with domain principles. Insights from the examined 3D channel flow pave the way
for integrating such hybrid approaches into efficient frameworks, [...] where
explainable predictions and real-time data analysis are crucial.

Result: 在DABstep和DABench基准测试中，I2I-STRADA在规划连贯性和洞察对齐方面优于现有系统。

Conclusion: 结构化认知工作流程对数据分析代理设计至关重要，I2I-STRADA为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic systems for data analysis have emphasized
automation of insight generation through multi-agent frameworks, and
orchestration layers. While these systems effectively manage tasks like query
translation, data transformation, and visualization, they often overlook the
structured reasoning process underlying analytical thinking. Reasoning large
language models (LLMs) used for multi-step problem solving are trained as
general-purpose problem solvers. As a result, their reasoning or thinking steps
do not adhere to fixed processes for specific tasks. Real-world data analysis
requires a consistent cognitive workflow: interpreting vague goals, grounding
them in contextual knowledge, constructing abstract plans, and adapting
execution based on intermediate outcomes. We introduce I2I-STRADA
(Information-to-Insight via Structured Reasoning Agent for Data Analysis), an
agentic architecture designed to formalize this reasoning process. I2I-STRADA
focuses on modeling how analysis unfolds via modular sub-tasks that reflect the
cognitive steps of analytical reasoning. Evaluations on the DABstep and DABench
benchmarks show that I2I-STRADA outperforms prior systems in planning coherence
and insight alignment, highlighting the importance of structured cognitive
workflows in agent design for data analysis.

Abstract: Qualitative timeline-based planning models domains as sets of independent,
but
  interacting, components whose behaviors over time, the timelines, are
governed
  by sets of qualitative temporal constraints (ordering relations), called
  synchronization rules.
  Its plan-existence problem has been shown to be PSPACE-complete; in
  particular, PSPACE-membership has been proved via reduction to the
  nonemptiness problem for nondeterministic finite automata.
  However, nondeterministic automata cannot be directly used to synthesize
  planning strategies as a costly determinization step is needed.
  In this paper, we identify a fragment of qualitative timeline-based planning
  whose plan-existence problem can be directly mapped into the nonemptiness
  problem of deterministic finite automata, which can then
  synthesize strategies.
  In addition, we identify a maximal subset of Allen's relations that fits into
  such a deterministic fragment.

1.898, t = -5.56, p < 0.001), with final outputs reaching 2.010 - a 70.4%
improvement. Refined slogans are 48.4% shorter, 40.7% more novel, with only a
4.0% drop in relevance. Cross-modal tests show strong slogan-to-image alignment
(CLIPScore: 0.249; BERTScore F1: 0.816). In human evaluations, 60% of outputs
scored >= 4.0, with metaphorical slogans (avg. 4.09) outperforming literal ones
(3.99). Feedback highlights stylistic precision and emotional resonance. These
results demonstrate that error-centered, feedback-driven generation enhances
creativity, offering a scalable path toward self-evolving, human-aligned
creative AI.

TL;DR: 研究表明，图表能提升AI系统在数据分析任务中的表现，尤其是复杂数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨图表是否对AI系统分析数据有帮助。

Method: 使用GPT 4.1和Claude 3.5进行实验，对比散点图、空白图和错误图的效果。

Result: AI系统在图表辅助下表现更精确，图表内容对提升效果起关键作用。

Conclusion: AI系统与人类类似，能从可视化中受益。

Abstract: Charts and graphs help people analyze data, but can they also be useful to AI
systems? To investigate this question, we perform a series of experiments with
two commercial vision-language models: GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5. Across three
representative analysis tasks, the two systems describe synthetic datasets more
precisely and accurately when raw data is accompanied by a scatterplot,
especially as datasets grow in complexity. Comparison with two baselines --
providing a blank chart and a chart with mismatched data -- shows that the
improved performance is due to the content of the charts. Our results are
initial evidence that AI systems, like humans, can benefit from visualization.

TL;DR: MAGPO是一种新的多智能体强化学习框架，通过结合集中式指导和分散式执行，优化了CTDE范式，并在理论和实践中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTDE方法未能充分利用集中式训练或缺乏理论保证，MAGPO旨在解决这些问题。

Method: MAGPO使用自回归联合策略进行可扩展的协调探索，并明确与分散式策略对齐以确保可部署性。

Result: 在43个任务和6个环境中，MAGPO表现优于基线CTDE方法，并匹配或超越完全集中式方法。

Conclusion: MAGPO为分散式多智能体学习提供了理论和实践上的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Due to practical constraints such as partial observability and limited
communication, Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has
become the dominant paradigm in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL). However, existing CTDE methods often underutilize centralized training
or lack theoretical guarantees. We propose Multi-Agent Guided Policy
Optimization (MAGPO), a novel framework that better leverages centralized
training by integrating centralized guidance with decentralized execution.
MAGPO uses an auto-regressive joint policy for scalable, coordinated
exploration and explicitly aligns it with decentralized policies to ensure
deployability under partial observability. We provide theoretical guarantees of
monotonic policy improvement and empirically evaluate MAGPO on 43 tasks across
6 diverse environments. Results show that MAGPO consistently outperforms strong
CTDE baselines and matches or surpasses fully centralized approaches, offering
a principled and practical solution for decentralized multi-agent learning. Our
code and experimental data can be found in https://github.com/liyheng/MAGPO.

TL;DR: ASI-Arch是一种人工超级智能系统，用于自主进行神经网络架构发现，突破了人类认知限制，实现了从自动化优化到自动化创新的范式转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI研究的速度受限于人类认知能力，ASI-Arch旨在通过自主创新打破这一瓶颈。

Method: ASI-Arch通过自主假设、实现、训练和验证新型架构，进行了大量实验，发现了106种创新的线性注意力架构。

Result: 系统发现了超越人类设计基准的架构，并首次建立了科学发现的规模定律。

Conclusion: ASI-Arch为自我加速的AI系统提供了蓝图，将研究进展从人类限制转变为可计算扩展的过程。

Abstract: While AI systems demonstrate exponentially improving capabilities, the pace
of AI research itself remains linearly bounded by human cognitive capacity,
creating an increasingly severe development bottleneck. We present ASI-Arch,
the first demonstration of Artificial Superintelligence for AI research
(ASI4AI) in the critical domain of neural architecture discovery--a fully
autonomous system that shatters this fundamental constraint by enabling AI to
conduct its own architectural innovation. Moving beyond traditional Neural
Architecture Search (NAS), which is fundamentally limited to exploring
human-defined spaces, we introduce a paradigm shift from automated optimization
to automated innovation. ASI-Arch can conduct end-to-end scientific research in
the domain of architecture discovery, autonomously hypothesizing novel
architectural concepts, implementing them as executable code, training and
empirically validating their performance through rigorous experimentation and
past experience. ASI-Arch conducted 1,773 autonomous experiments over 20,000
GPU hours, culminating in the discovery of 106 innovative, state-of-the-art
(SOTA) linear attention architectures. Like AlphaGo's Move 37 that revealed
unexpected strategic insights invisible to human players, our AI-discovered
architectures demonstrate emergent design principles that systematically
surpass human-designed baselines and illuminate previously unknown pathways for
architectural innovation. Crucially, we establish the first empirical scaling
law for scientific discovery itself--demonstrating that architectural
breakthroughs can be scaled computationally, transforming research progress
from a human-limited to a computation-scalable process. We provide
comprehensive analysis of the emergent design patterns and autonomous research
capabilities that enabled these breakthroughs, establishing a blueprint for
self-accelerating AI systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种Agentic AI框架，自动化临床数据处理流程，从数据输入到推理，通过模块化、任务特定的代理实现，减少人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域机器学习解决方案的构建和部署成本高且劳动密集，主要由于分散的预处理流程、模型兼容性问题以及严格的数据隐私限制。

Method: 框架包含多个代理，分别处理数据输入、匿名化、特征提取、模型匹配、预处理和推理，支持结构化和非结构化数据。

Result: 在老年医学、姑息治疗和结肠镜成像等公开数据集上验证，实现了自动化的特征选择、模型选择和预处理。

Conclusion: 该框架通过自动化机器学习生命周期中的高摩擦阶段，减少了专家干预需求，为临床环境中的AI应用提供了可扩展且成本高效的途径。

Abstract: Building and deploying machine learning solutions in healthcare remains
expensive and labor-intensive due to fragmented preprocessing workflows, model
compatibility issues, and stringent data privacy constraints. In this work, we
introduce an Agentic AI framework that automates the entire clinical data
pipeline, from ingestion to inference, through a system of modular,
task-specific agents. These agents handle both structured and unstructured
data, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing
recommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly
available datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.
For example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured
data (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by
the Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring
privacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize
it. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based
approach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage
MedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.
These features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the
best-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent
and Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on
data type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent" runs
the selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs
using tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps. By automating these
high-friction stages of the ML lifecycle, the proposed framework reduces the
need for repeated expert intervention, offering a scalable, cost-efficient
pathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments.

TL;DR: 利用自然语言处理（NLP）和主动学习技术，开发分类器以从急诊科分诊笔记中快速检测疫苗安全问题，提升疫苗安全性监测效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于临床试验和早期广泛实施中安全性数据收集窗口有限，需要建立许可后监测系统。急诊科分诊笔记包含关键患者信息，可用于疫苗安全信号监测。

Method: 结合NLP、主动学习和数据增强技术，开发分类器以减少关键词分类的假阳性问题，并优化标注数据质量。

Result: 开发出高效分类器，能够从急诊科分诊笔记中准确识别疫苗安全问题，提升监测速度和准确性。

Conclusion: NLP与主动学习的结合为疫苗安全性监测提供了更高效、准确的解决方案，尤其在数据稀缺的医疗领域具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines has showcased the global
communitys ability to combat infectious diseases. However, the need for
post-licensure surveillance systems has grown due to the limited window for
safety data collection in clinical trials and early widespread implementation.
This study aims to employ Natural Language Processing techniques and Active
Learning to rapidly develop a classifier that detects potential vaccine safety
issues from emergency department notes. ED triage notes, containing expert,
succinct vital patient information at the point of entry to health systems, can
significantly contribute to timely vaccine safety signal surveillance. While
keyword-based classification can be effective, it may yield false positives and
demand extensive keyword modifications. This is exacerbated by the infrequency
of vaccination-related ED presentations and their similarity to other reasons
for ED visits. NLP offers a more accurate and efficient alternative, albeit
requiring annotated data, which is often scarce in the medical field. Active
learning optimizes the annotation process and the quality of annotated data,
which can result in faster model implementation and improved model performance.
This work combines active learning, data augmentation, and active learning and
evaluation techniques to create a classifier that is used to enhance vaccine
safety surveillance from ED triage notes.

TL;DR: 研究了使用均值聚合函数的图神经网络（GNNs）的表达能力，发现其在非均匀设置下与比率模态逻辑等价，而在均匀设置下低于求和与最大值聚合GNNs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨均值聚合GNNs的表达能力，并与求和、最大值聚合GNNs进行对比，以理解不同聚合函数对GNNs表达能力的影响。

Method: 在非均匀和均匀设置下，通过逻辑理论（如比率模态逻辑和MSO）分析均值聚合GNNs的表达能力。

Result: 非均匀设置下，均值聚合GNNs与比率模态逻辑等价；均匀设置下，其表达能力低于求和和最大值聚合GNNs。

Conclusion: 均值聚合GNNs的表达能力受设置和假设条件影响，在特定条件下可能低于其他聚合函数。

Abstract: We study the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) with mean as
the aggregation function. In the non-uniform setting, we show that such GNNs
have exactly the same expressive power as ratio modal logic, which has modal
operators expressing that at least a certain ratio of the successors of a
vertex satisfies a specified property. The non-uniform expressive power of mean
GNNs is thus higher than that of GNNs with max aggregation, but lower than for
sum aggregation--the latter are characterized by modal logic and graded modal
logic, respectively. In the uniform setting, we show that the expressive power
relative to MSO is exactly that of alternation-free modal logic, under the
natural assumptions that combination functions are continuous and
classification functions are thresholds. This implies that, relative to MSO and
in the uniform setting, mean GNNs are strictly less expressive than sum GNNs
and max GNNs. When any of the assumptions is dropped, the expressive power
increases.

*Mutian Yang,Jiandong Gao,Ji Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种认知归因框架，通过分解知识检索和推理调整两个阶段，量化大型语言模型（LLMs）中知识和推理的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受双系统认知理论启发，研究旨在区分LLMs中的知识和推理能力，以提升模型分析、可解释性和开发。

Method: 通过快速思维和慢速思维两种认知模式提示LLMs生成答案，分析不同模式下的表现以量化知识和推理的贡献。

Result: 结果显示：推理调整具有领域特异性；参数扩展提升知识和推理能力，知识提升更显著；知识主要存在于低层网络，推理则在高层。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅从“解耦”角度理解LLMs，还为扩展定律、分层知识编辑和小模型推理限制等研究提供了新见解。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) leverage both knowledge and reasoning
during inference, the capacity to distinguish between them plays a pivotal role
in model analysis, interpretability, and development. Inspired by dual-system
cognitive theory, we propose a cognition attribution framework to decouple the
contribution of knowledge and reasoning. In particular, the cognition of LLMs
is decomposed into two distinct yet complementary phases: knowledge retrieval
(Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2). To separate these phases, LLMs
are prompted to generate answers under two different cognitive modes, fast
thinking and slow thinking, respectively. The performance under different
cognitive modes is analyzed to quantify the contribution of knowledge and
reasoning. This architecture is employed to 15 LLMs across 3 datasets. Results
reveal: (1) reasoning adjustment is domain-specific, benefiting
reasoning-intensive domains (e.g., mathematics, physics, and chemistry) and
potentially imparing knowledge-intensive domains. (2) Parameter scaling
improves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improvements being more
pronounced. Additionally, parameter scaling make LLMs reasoning significantly
more prudent, while moderately more intelligent. (3) Knowledge primarily
resides in lower network layers, while reasoning operates in higher layers. Our
framework not only helps understand LLMs from a "decoupling" perspective, but
also provides new insights into existing research, including scaling laws,
hierarchical knowledge editing, and limitations of small-model reasoning.

Motivation: 探讨析取在Answer Set Programming中的非最小化语义，比较不同方法的异同。

Method: 比较四种不同的析取语义，包括Justified Models、Strongly Supported Models、Forks和DI语义，分析其定义和关系。

Result: 证明三种方法（Forks、Justified Models和DI语义的合理松弛）实际上一致，且比Strongly Supported Models更强。

Conclusion: 这些方法为析提供了一种共同的非最小化语义，扩展了稳定模型的范围。

Abstract: In this paper, we compare four different semantics for disjunction in Answer
Set Programming that, unlike stable models, do not adhere to the principle of
model minimality. Two of these approaches, Cabalar and Mu\~niz' \emph{Justified
Models} and Doherty and Szalas' \emph{Strongly Supported Models}, directly
provide an alternative non-minimal semantics for disjunction. The other two,
Aguado et al's \emph{Forks} and Shen and Eiter's \emph{Determining Inference}
(DI) semantics, actually introduce a new disjunction connective, but are
compared here as if they constituted new semantics for the standard disjunction
operator. We are able to prove that three of these approaches (Forks, Justified
Models and a reasonable relaxation of the DI semantics) actually coincide,
constituting a common single approach under different definitions. Moreover,
this common semantics always provides a superset of the stable models of a
program (in fact, modulo any context) and is strictly stronger than the fourth
approach (Strongly Supported Models), that actually treats disjunctions as in
classical logic.

Result: 提供了一个逻辑化的AI风险分析哲学基础，并为高风险AI和通用AI系统设计了操作性评估模型。

Conclusion: 未来工作将开发形式化模型和算法，以增强AI风险评估，支持负责任的AI治理。

Abstract: This chapter introduces a conceptual framework for qualitative risk
assessment of AI, particularly in the context of the EU AI Act. The framework
addresses the complexities of legal compliance and fundamental rights
protection by itegrating definitional balancing and defeasible reasoning.
Definitional balancing employs proportionality analysis to resolve conflicts
between competing rights, while defeasible reasoning accommodates the dynamic
nature of legal decision-making. Our approach stresses the need for an analysis
of AI deployment scenarios and for identifying potential legal violations and
multi-layered impacts on fundamental rights. On the basis of this analysis, we
provide philosophical foundations for a logical account of AI risk analysis. In
particular, we consider the basic building blocks for conceptually grasping the
interaction between AI deployment scenarios and fundamental rights,
incorporating in defeasible reasoning definitional balancing and arguments
about the contextual promotion or demotion of rights. This layered approach
allows for more operative models of assessment of both high-risk AI systems and
General Purpose AI (GPAI) systems, emphasizing the broader applicability of the
latter. Future work aims to develop a formal model and effective algorithms to
enhance AI risk assessment, bridging theoretical insights with practical
applications to support responsible AI governance.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效，能够自动化批改物理考试答案，但项重写系统的开发和验证较为复杂。

Abstract: We present our method for automatically marking Physics exams. The marking
problem consists in assessing typed student answers for correctness with
respect to a ground truth solution. This is a challenging problem that we seek
to tackle using a combination of a computer algebra system, an SMT solver and a
term rewriting system. A Large Language Model is used to interpret and remove
errors from student responses and rewrite these in a machine readable format.
Once formalized and language-aligned, the next step then consists in applying
automated reasoning techniques for assessing student solution correctness. We
consider two methods of automated theorem proving: off-the-shelf SMT solving
and term rewriting systems tailored for physics problems involving
trigonometric expressions. The development of the term rewrite system and
establishing termination and confluence properties was not trivial, and we
describe it in some detail in the paper. We evaluate our system on a rich pool
of over 1500 real-world student exam responses from the 2023 Australian Physics
Olympiad.

  ConDiFi features 607 macro-financial prompts for divergent reasoning and 990
multi-hop adversarial MCQs for convergent reasoning. Using this benchmark, we
evaluated 14 leading models and uncovered striking differences. Despite high
fluency, GPT-4o underperforms on Novelty and Actionability. In contrast, models
like DeepSeek-R1 and Cohere Command R+ rank among the top for generating
actionable, insights suitable for investment decisions. ConDiFi provides a new

Conclusion: IBRO框架为LLM推理提供了理论支持，轻量级的IB正则化方法易于实现且效果显著。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress
in reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR). By leveraging simple rule-based rewards, RL effectively
incentivizes LLMs to produce extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
trajectories, progressively guiding them toward correct answers. However,
existing approaches remain largely heuristic and intuition-driven, limiting the
development of principled methodologies. In this paper, we present a
theoretical characterization of LLM reasoning grounded in information
bottleneck (IB) principle, introducing IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO),
a framework that encourages reasoning trajectories to be both informative about
the final correct answer and generalizable across diverse prompts. We derive a
practical token-level surrogate objective and propose an efficient
approximation, resulting in the lightweight IB regularization method. This
technique integrates seamlessly into existing RL-based post-training frameworks
without additional computational overhead, requiring only a one-line code
modification. Empirically, we validate IB regularization across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms, demonstrating consistent
improvements in LLM reasoning performance.

Result: PPO在1000次测试中表现最优，实现了最高奖励、最低客户等待时间和员工闲置时间。

Conclusion: PPO虽需更长时间训练，但在呼叫中心路由优化中效果最佳。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
optimise call routing in call centres to minimise client waiting time and staff
idle time. Two methods are compared: a model-based approach using Value
Iteration (VI) under known system dynamics, and a model-free approach using
Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) that learns from experience. For the
model-based approach, a theoretical model is used, while a simulation model
combining Discrete Event Simulation (DES) with the OpenAI Gym environment is
developed for model-free learning. Both models frame the problem as a Markov
Decision Process (MDP) within a Skills-Based Routing (SBR) framework, with
Poisson client arrivals and exponentially distributed service and abandonment
times. For policy evaluation, random, VI, and PPO policies are evaluated using
the simulation model. After 1,000 test episodes, PPO consistently achives the
highest rewards, along with the lowest client waiting time and staff idle time,
despite requiring longer training time.

Conclusion: GPU加速的CT算法为处理大规模表约束问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Constraint Programming developed within Logic Programming in the Eighties;
nowadays all Prolog systems encompass modules capable of handling constraint
programming on finite domains demanding their solution to a constraint solver.
This work focuses on a specific form of constraint, the so-called table
constraint, used to specify conditions on the values of variables as an
enumeration of alternative options. Since every condition on a set of finite
domain variables can be ultimately expressed as a finite set of cases, Table
can, in principle, simulate any other constraint. These characteristics make
Table one of the most studied constraints ever, leading to a series of
increasingly efficient propagation algorithms. Despite this, it is not uncommon
to encounter real-world problems with hundreds or thousands of valid cases that
are simply too many to be handled effectively with standard CPU-based
approaches. In this paper, we deal with the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm, the
state-of-the-art propagation algorithms for Table. We describe how CT can be
enhanced by exploiting the massive computational power offered by modern GPUs
to handle large Table constraints. In particular, we report on the design and
implementation of GPU-accelerated CT, on its integration into an existing
constraint solver, and on an experimental validation performed on a significant
set of instances.

Abstract: Concept probing has recently garnered increasing interest as a way to help
interpret artificial neural networks, dealing both with their typically large
size and their subsymbolic nature, which ultimately renders them unfeasible for
direct human interpretation. Concept probing works by training additional
classifiers to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined
concepts of interest, thus allowing humans to peek inside artificial neural
networks. Research on concept probing has mainly focused on the model being
probed or the probing model itself, paying limited attention to the data
required to train such probing models. In this paper, we address this gap.
Focusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we
investigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their
performance. We also make available concept labels for two widely used
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有对齐方法（如RLHF）仅学习人类偏好的局限性，开发具有内在安全推理和自省能力的AI模型。

Method: 采用SafeLadder框架，结合大规模、渐进式、安全导向的强化学习后训练，并配备多原则验证器。

Result: SafeWork-R1在安全相关基准测试中平均提升46.54%，性能优于GPT-4.1和Claude Opus 4。

Conclusion: SafeLadder框架证明安全与能力可协同进化，适用于构建稳健、可靠、可信的通用AI。

Abstract: We introduce SafeWork-R1, a cutting-edge multimodal reasoning model that
demonstrates the coevolution of capabilities and safety. It is developed by our
proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive,
safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of
multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that
simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop
intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety
`aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of
$46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks
without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety
performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude
Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct
inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism,
enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop
SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and
SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and
capability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of
our framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.

### [162] [Enhancing Quantization-Aware Training on Edge Devices via Relative Entropy Coreset Selection and Cascaded Layer Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17768)
*Yujia Tong,Jingling Yuan,Chuang Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QuaRC框架通过核心集选择和层校正策略，在边缘设备上高效训练低比特量化模型，显著减少量化误差并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着移动和边缘计算的发展，边缘设备需要高效部署低比特量化模型，但隐私问题限制了数据使用，传统QAT方法计算成本高，且小规模数据集下性能下降严重。

Method: QuaRC提出两阶段方法：1) 核心集选择阶段使用“相对熵分数”识别代表性子集；2) 训练阶段采用“级联层校正”策略对齐量化模型与全精度模型的中间层输出。

Result: 实验显示，QuaRC在ImageNet-1K数据集上，使用1%数据子集量化ResNet-18至2比特时，Top-1准确率比现有技术提升5.72%。

Conclusion: QuaRC有效解决了小规模数据集下量化误差问题，为边缘设备上的高效量化训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: With the development of mobile and edge computing, the demand for low-bit
quantized models on edge devices is increasing to achieve efficient deployment.
To enhance the performance, it is often necessary to retrain the quantized
models using edge data. However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive
data can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing
Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective
solution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for
training, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques
can mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.
However, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the
model when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to
significant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,
a QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main
phases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy
Score" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's
quantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded
Layer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the
quantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively
reducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, when
quantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset, QuaRC achieves a 5.72%
improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset compared to
state-of-the-art techniques.

TL;DR: 提出了一种低复杂度、通用的AI模型，通过因果不变学习提取数据的因果和非因果表示，提升语义通信中信道解码器的数据重建能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在语义通信中表现出高效性和鲁棒性，适用于多样化的数据域。

Abstract: In this study, we design a low-complexity and generalized AI model that can
capture common knowledge to improve data reconstruction of the channel decoder
for semantic communication. Specifically, we propose a generative adversarial
network that leverages causality-invariant learning to extract causal and
non-causal representations from the data. Causal representations are invariant
and encompass crucial information to identify the data's label. They can
encapsulate semantic knowledge and facilitate effective data reconstruction at
the receiver. Moreover, the causal mechanism ensures that learned
representations remain consistent across different domains, making the system
reliable even with users collecting data from diverse domains. As
user-collected data evolves over time causing knowledge divergence among users,
we design sparse update protocols to improve the invariant properties of the
knowledge while minimizing communication overheads. Three key observations were
drawn from our empirical evaluations. Firstly, causality-invariant knowledge
ensures consistency across different devices despite the diverse training data.
Secondly, invariant knowledge has promising performance in classification
tasks, which is pivotal for goal-oriented semantic communications. Thirdly, our
knowledge-based data reconstruction highlights the robustness of our decoder,
which surpasses other state-of-the-art data reconstruction and semantic
compression methods in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).

Abstract: Current research has found that some deep neural networks exhibit strong
hierarchical self-similarity in feature representation or parameter
distribution. However, aside from preliminary studies on how the power-law
distribution of weights across different training stages affects model
performance,there has been no quantitative analysis on how the self-similarity
of hidden space geometry influences model weight optimization, nor is there a
clear understanding of the dynamic behavior of internal neurons. Therefore,
this paper proposes a complex network modeling method based on the output
features of hidden-layer neurons to investigate the self-similarity of feature
networks constructed at different hidden layers, and analyzes how adjusting the
degree of self-similarity in feature networks can enhance the classification
performance of deep neural networks. Validated on three types of networks MLP
architectures, convolutional networks, and attention architectures this study
reveals that the degree of self-similarity exhibited by feature networks varies
across different model architectures. Furthermore, embedding constraints on the
self-similarity of feature networks during the training process can improve the
performance of self-similar deep neural networks (MLP architectures and
attention architectures) by up to 6 percentage points.

Conclusion: 该方法在减少计算量的同时，能够有效解释优化结果，适用于气动形状优化问题。

Abstract: We introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) based adaptive optimization
algorithm for aerodynamic shape optimization focused on dimensionality
reduction. The form in which RL is applied here is that of a surrogate-based,
actor-critic policy evaluation MCMC approach allowing for temporal 'freezing'
of some of the parameters to be optimized. The goals are to minimize
computational effort, and to use the observed optimization results for
interpretation of the discovered extrema in terms of their role in achieving
the desired flow-field.
  By a sequence of local optimized parameter changes around intermediate CFD
simulations acting as ground truth, it is possible to speed up the global
optimization if (a) the local neighbourhoods of the parameters in which the
changed parameters must reside are sufficiently large to compete with the
grid-sized steps and its large number of simulations, and (b) the estimates of
the rewards and costs on these neighbourhoods necessary for a good step-wise
parameter adaption are sufficiently accurate. We give an example of a simple
fluid-dynamical problem on which the method allows interpretation in the sense
of a feature importance scoring.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on massive datasets, including large language
models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), and large multimodal models, have
demonstrated remarkable success in diverse downstream tasks. However, recent
studies have shown fundamental limitations of these models: (1) limited
representational capacity, (2) lower adaptability, and (3) diminishing
scalability. These shortcomings raise a critical question: is Euclidean
geometry truly the optimal inductive bias for all foundation models, or could
incorporating alternative geometric spaces enable models to better align with
the intrinsic structure of real-world data and improve reasoning processes?
Hyperbolic spaces, a class of non-Euclidean manifolds characterized by
exponential volume growth with respect to distance, offer a mathematically
grounded solution. These spaces enable low-distortion embeddings of
hierarchical structures (e.g., trees, taxonomies) and power-law distributions
with substantially fewer dimensions compared to Euclidean counterparts. Recent
advances have leveraged these properties to enhance foundation models,
including improving LLMs' complex reasoning ability, VLMs' zero-shot
generalization, and cross-modal semantic alignment, while maintaining parameter
efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive review of hyperbolic neural
networks and their recent development for foundation models. We further outline
key challenges and research directions to advance the field.

TL;DR: 论文研究了LLM在排名和评估任务中的位置偏差和重复不一致问题，提出了一种动态早停方法以减少计算成本，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在排名和评估任务中存在位置偏差和重复不一致问题，现有方法通过多次重复和多数投票解决，但计算成本高。

Method: 提出动态早停方法，自适应确定每个实例所需的重复次数，并引入基于置信度的改进。

Result: 动态策略平均减少81%的LLM调用，基于置信度的改进进一步减少至87%，准确性损失较小。

Conclusion: 动态早停方法有效解决了位置偏差和重复不一致问题，显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: When using LLMs to rank items based on given criteria, or evaluate answers,
the order of candidate items can influence the model's final decision. This
sensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.
Prior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its
severity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs
also exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the
LLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To
address both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple
times with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority
voting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases
computational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the
direction -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --
and magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within
a single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance
mitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method
that adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each
instance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two
tasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a
dynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of
81%, while preserving the accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-based
adaptation to our early-stopping method, reducing LLM calls by an average of
87% compared to static repetition, with only a slight accuracy trade-off
relative to our original early-stopping method.

Conclusion: CICME通过结合池化数据和个体领域数据的因果发现方法，展示了其在特定场景下的优越性能。

Abstract: To gain deeper insights into a complex sensor system through the lens of
causality, we present common and individual causal mechanism estimation
(CICME), a novel three-step approach to inferring causal mechanisms from
heterogeneous data collected across multiple domains. By leveraging the
principle of Causal Transfer Learning (CTL), CICME is able to reliably detect
domain-invariant causal mechanisms when provided with sufficient samples. The
identified common causal mechanisms are further used to guide the estimation of
the remaining causal mechanisms in each domain individually. The performance of
CICME is evaluated on linear Gaussian models under scenarios inspired from a
manufacturing process. Building upon existing continuous optimization-based
causal discovery methods, we show that CICME leverages the benefits of applying
causal discovery on the pooled data and repeatedly on data from individual
domains, and it even outperforms both baseline methods under certain scenarios.

Motivation: 现有移动流量预测方法在不同城市环境中的适应性差，且因个人流量模式的高不确定性和环境上下文缺失导致预测不准确。

Method: LSDM结合扩散模型的生成能力和Transformer的自适应学习能力，利用LLM捕捉多模态环境信息。

Conclusion: LSDM通过融合扩散模型和LLM，显著提升了移动流量预测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Service-level mobile traffic prediction for individual users is essential for
network efficiency and quality of service enhancement. However, current
prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban
environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in
personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the
complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand
advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and
rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models
in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual
understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model
(LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the
adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to
capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level
patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level
datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions,
showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating
contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in
terms of the coefficient of determination. Compared to models of a similar
type, such as CSDI, the root mean squared error can be reduced by at least
8.29%. The code and dataset will be available at:

Conclusion: CoCAI在理论和实践中均表现出色，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework that harnesses the power of generative
artificial intelligence and copula-based modeling to address two critical
challenges in multivariate time-series analysis: delivering accurate
predictions and enabling robust anomaly detection. Our method, Copula-based
Conformal Anomaly Identification for Multivariate Time-Series (CoCAI),
leverages a diffusion-based model to capture complex dependencies within the
data, enabling high quality forecasting. The model's outputs are further
calibrated using a conformal prediction technique, yielding predictive regions
which are statistically valid, i.e., cover the true target values with a
desired confidence level. Starting from these calibrated forecasts, robust
outlier detection is performed by combining dimensionality reduction techniques
with copula-based modeling, providing a statistically grounded anomaly score.
CoCAI benefits from an offline calibration phase that allows for minimal
overhead during deployment and delivers actionable results rooted in
established theoretical foundations. Empirical tests conducted on real
operational data derived from water distribution and sewerage systems confirm
CoCAI's effectiveness in accurately forecasting target sequences of data and in
identifying anomalous segments within them.

Method: GenSelect通过长推理从并行采样的候选方案中选择最佳方案，适用于数学推理任务。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，GenSelect表现优于现有评分方法，如QwQ和DeepSeek-R1-0528。

Conclusion: GenSelect有效结合了LLM的比较能力和高效扩展性，为推理任务提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative reward models with parallel sampling have enabled effective
test-time scaling for reasoning tasks. Current approaches employ pointwise
scoring of individual solutions or pairwise comparisons. However, pointwise
methods underutilize LLMs' comparative abilities, while pairwise methods scale
inefficiently with larger sampling budgets. We introduce GenSelect, where the
LLM uses long reasoning to select the best solution among N candidates. This
leverages LLMs' comparative strengths while scaling efficiently across parallel
sampling budgets. For math reasoning, we demonstrate that reasoning models,
such as QwQ and DeepSeek-R1-0528, excel at GenSelect, outperforming existing
scoring approaches with simple prompting.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) precipitation prediction is essential for reducing
damage from stationary and localized heavy rainfall; however, HR precipitation
forecasts using process-driven numerical weather prediction models remains
challenging. This study proposes using Wasserstein Generative Adversarial
Network (WGAN) to perform precipitation downscaling with an optimal transport
cost. In contrast to a conventional neural network trained with mean squared
error, the WGAN generated visually realistic precipitation fields with
fine-scale structures even though the WGAN exhibited slightly lower performance
on conventional evaluation metrics. The learned critic of WGAN correlated well
with human perceptual realism. Case-based analysis revealed that large
discrepancies in critic scores can help identify both unrealistic WGAN outputs
and potential artifacts in the reference data. These findings suggest that the
WGAN framework not only improves perceptual realism in precipitation
downscaling but also offers a new perspective for evaluating and
quality-controlling precipitation datasets.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，GraphEXT在多种GNN架构中均优于基线方法，显著提高了模型的可解释性。

Conclusion: GraphEXT通过强调节点交互和结构变化对预测的影响，为GNN提供了更有效的可解释性框架。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved outstanding performance across a
wide range of graph-related tasks. However, their "black-box" nature poses
significant challenges to their explainability, and existing methods often fail
to effectively capture the intricate interaction patterns among nodes within
the network. In this work, we propose a novel explainability framework,
GraphEXT, which leverages cooperative game theory and the concept of social
externalities. GraphEXT partitions graph nodes into coalitions, decomposing the
original graph into independent subgraphs. By integrating graph structure as an
externality and incorporating the Shapley value under externalities, GraphEXT
quantifies node importance through their marginal contributions to GNN
predictions as the nodes transition between coalitions. Unlike traditional
Shapley value-based methods that primarily focus on node attributes, our
GraphEXT places greater emphasis on the interactions among nodes and the impact
of structural changes on GNN predictions. Experimental studies on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that GraphEXT outperforms existing
baseline methods in terms of fidelity across diverse GNN architectures ,
significantly enhancing the explainability of GNN models.

Conclusion: 分子任务算术因其简单性、数据效率和性能，有望成为分子设计的标准迁移学习策略。

Abstract: The scarcity of molecules with desirable properties (i.e., 'positive'
molecules) is an inherent bottleneck for generative molecule design. To
sidestep such obstacle, here we propose molecular task arithmetic: training a
model on diverse and abundant negative examples to learn 'property directions'
$--$ without accessing any positively labeled data $--$ and moving models in
the opposite property directions to generate positive molecules. When analyzed
on 20 zero-shot design experiments, molecular task arithmetic generated more
diverse and successful designs than models trained on positive molecules.
Moreover, we employed molecular task arithmetic in dual-objective and few-shot
design tasks. We find that molecular task arithmetic can consistently increase
the diversity of designs while maintaining desirable design properties. With
its simplicity, data efficiency, and performance, molecular task arithmetic
bears the potential to become the $\textit{de-facto}$ transfer learning
strategy for de novo molecule design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络（如LSTM、TCN等）在处理非周期性输入时表现不佳，MFNO通过镜像填充扩展FNO，解决了这一问题。

Method: MFNO结合镜像填充技术，理论基于Wong--Zakai定理和近似方法，证明其逼近能力。

Result: MFNO在分辨率泛化上表现优异，生成样本路径速度显著快于传统数值方法，性能优于基线模型。

Conclusion: MFNO为处理非周期性输入的随机系统提供了一种高效且理论可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces an operator-based neural network, the mirror-padded
Fourier neural operator (MFNO), designed to learn the dynamics of stochastic
systems. MFNO extends the standard Fourier neural operator (FNO) by
incorporating mirror padding, enabling it to handle non-periodic inputs. We
rigorously prove that MFNOs can approximate solutions of path-dependent
stochastic differential equations and Lipschitz transformations of fractional
Brownian motions to an arbitrary degree of accuracy. Our theoretical analysis
builds on Wong--Zakai type theorems and various approximation techniques.
Empirically, the MFNO exhibits strong resolution generalization--a property
rarely seen in standard architectures such as LSTMs, TCNs, and DeepONet.
Furthermore, our model achieves performance that is comparable or superior to
these baselines while offering significantly faster sample path generation than
classical numerical schemes.

TL;DR: 论文研究了在差分隐私机器学习中，当公共数据与私有数据存在显著分布偏移时的性能下界。结果表明，偏移较小时需要大量数据，偏移较大时公共数据无益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨公共数据与私有数据在分布偏移情况下的互补价值，填补现有理论空白。

Method: 扩展已知下界至分布偏移场景，分析高斯均值估计和线性回归中的参数偏移。

Result: 偏移较小时需大量数据估计私有参数；偏移较大时公共数据无益。

Conclusion: 分布偏移程度决定了公共数据在差分隐私学习中的价值。

Abstract: The most effective differentially private machine learning algorithms in
practice rely on an additional source of purportedly public data. This paradigm
is most interesting when the two sources combine to be more than the sum of
their parts. However, there are settings such as mean estimation where we have
strong lower bounds, showing that when the two data sources have the same
distribution, there is no complementary value to combining the two data
sources. In this work we extend the known lower bounds for public-private
learning to setting where the two data sources exhibit significant distribution
shift. Our results apply to both Gaussian mean estimation where the two
distributions have different means, and to Gaussian linear regression where the
two distributions exhibit parameter shift. We find that when the shift is small
(relative to the desired accuracy), either public or private data must be
sufficiently abundant to estimate the private parameter. Conversely, when the
shift is large, public data provides no benefit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习需要数据集中存储，而FL利用用户设备训练共享模型，同时保护隐私。云机器人操作受限于计算资源，FL为其提供了分布式计算的潜力。

Method: 介绍了FL的基本概念及其与云机器人操作的联系，探讨了在集中式或分散式设置中设计和验证FL模型的方法。

Result: FL为云机器人操作提供了灵活性和可靠性，但也带来了挑战，如高效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: FL在云机器人操作中具有潜力，但需进一步研究以解决其实现中的挑战。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm,
where the collaborative training of a model involves dynamic participation of
devices to achieve broad objectives. In contrast, classical machine learning
(ML) typically requires data to be located on-premises for training, whereas FL
leverages numerous user devices to train a shared global model without the need
to share private data. Current robotic manipulation tasks are constrained by
the individual capabilities and speed of robots due to limited low-latency
computing resources. Consequently, the concept of cloud robotics has emerged,
allowing robotic applications to harness the flexibility and reliability of
computing resources, effectively alleviating their computational demands across
the cloud-edge continuum. Undoubtedly, within this distributed computing
context, as exemplified in cloud robotic manipulation scenarios, FL offers
manifold advantages while also presenting several challenges and opportunities.
In this paper, we present fundamental concepts of FL and their connection to
cloud robotic manipulation. Additionally, we envision the opportunities and
challenges associated with realizing efficient and reliable cloud robotic
manipulation at scale through FL, where researchers adopt to design and verify
FL models in either centralized or decentralized settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多孔超材料的逆向设计，以生成具有特定水力特性（如孔隙率和渗透率）的结构。

Method: 开发了pVAE（变分自编码器增强回归器），结合卷积神经网络（CNN）预测水力特性，并利用LBM生成数据。

Result: pVAE框架成功生成了具有目标特性的新材料，并通过分析潜在空间实现了结构-特性映射和逆向设计。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效设计多孔超材料提供了新途径，相关数据和代码将开源以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: The ultimate aim of the study is to explore the inverse design of porous
metamaterials using a deep learning-based generative framework. Specifically,
we develop a property-variational autoencoder (pVAE), a variational autoencoder
(VAE) augmented with a regressor, to generate structured metamaterials with
tailored hydraulic properties, such as porosity and permeability. While this
work uses the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to generate intrinsic permeability
tensor data for limited porous microstructures, a convolutional neural network
(CNN) is trained using a bottom-up approach to predict effective hydraulic
properties. This significantly reduces the computational cost compared to
direct LBM simulations. The pVAE framework is trained on two datasets: a
synthetic dataset of artificial porous microstructures and CT-scan images of
volume elements from real open-cell foams. The encoder-decoder architecture of
the VAE captures key microstructural features, mapping them into a compact and
interpretable latent space for efficient structure-property exploration. The
study provides a detailed analysis and interpretation of the latent space,
demonstrating its role in structure-property mapping, interpolation, and
inverse design. This approach facilitates the generation of new metamaterials
with desired properties. The datasets and codes used in this study will be made
open-access to support further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释先进神经网络（SOTA NNs）的性能，并验证重尾自正则化（HTSR）理论中的关键指标。

Method: 结合统计力学、随机矩阵理论和量子化学方法，推导出新的学习度量ERG，并在3层MLP和SOTA NNs上验证。

Result: SETOL与HTSR的关键指标（alpha和alpha-hat）表现一致，验证了理论假设。

Conclusion: SETOL为神经网络学习提供了新的理论框架，并验证了其与现有指标的一致性。

Abstract: We present a SemiEmpirical Theory of Learning (SETOL) that explains the
remarkable performance of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) Neural Networks (NNs). We
provide a formal explanation of the origin of the fundamental quantities in the
phenomenological theory of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR): the
heavy-tailed power-law layer quality metrics, alpha and alpha-hat. In prior
work, these metrics have been shown to predict trends in the test accuracies of
pretrained SOTA NN models, importantly, without needing access to either
testing or training data. Our SETOL uses techniques from statistical mechanics
as well as advanced methods from random matrix theory and quantum chemistry.
The derivation suggests new mathematical preconditions for ideal learning,
including a new metric, ERG, which is equivalent to applying a single step of
the Wilson Exact Renormalization Group. We test the assumptions and predictions
of SETOL on a simple 3-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating
excellent agreement with the key theoretical assumptions. For SOTA NN models,
we show how to estimate the individual layer qualities of a trained NN by
simply computing the empirical spectral density (ESD) of the layer weight
matrices and plugging this ESD into our SETOL formulas. Notably, we examine the
performance of the HTSR alpha and the SETOL ERG layer quality metrics, and find
that they align remarkably well, both on our MLP and on SOTA NNs.

Conclusion: 人机协作能有效结合人类创造力和机器计算能力，实现全面、可扩展的红队测试，提升T2I模型安全性评估。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have become prevalent across numerous
applications, making their robust evaluation against adversarial attacks a
critical priority. Continuous access to new and challenging adversarial prompts
across diverse domains is essential for stress-testing these models for
resilience against novel attacks from multiple vectors. Current techniques for
generating such prompts are either entirely authored by humans or synthetically
generated. On the one hand, datasets of human-crafted adversarial prompts are
often too small in size and imbalanced in their cultural and contextual
representation. On the other hand, datasets of synthetically-generated prompts
achieve scale, but typically lack the realistic nuances and creative
adversarial strategies found in human-crafted prompts. To combine the strengths
of both human and machine approaches, we propose Seed2Harvest, a hybrid
red-teaming method for guided expansion of culturally diverse, human-crafted
adversarial prompt seeds. The resulting prompts preserve the characteristics
and attack patterns of human prompts while maintaining comparable average
attack success rates (0.31 NudeNet, 0.36 SD NSFW, 0.12 Q16). Our expanded
dataset achieves substantially higher diversity with 535 unique geographic
locations and a Shannon entropy of 7.48, compared to 58 locations and 5.28
entropy in the original dataset. Our work demonstrates the importance of
human-machine collaboration in leveraging human creativity and machine
computational capacity to achieve comprehensive, scalable red-teaming for
continuous T2I model safety evaluation.

TL;DR: UrbanPulse是一个可扩展的深度学习框架，用于超细粒度、城市范围的OD流预测，通过将每个POI作为独立节点处理，结合时空图卷积编码器和基于Transformer的解码器，实现跨城市的高精度预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在人口流动预测中存在局限性，如静态空间假设、跨城市泛化能力差、计算成本高或空间分辨率低。UrbanPulse旨在解决这些问题，提供高分辨率、可扩展的预测方案。

Method: UrbanPulse采用时空图卷积编码器和Transformer解码器建模多尺度时空依赖，并通过三阶段迁移学习策略（预训练、冷启动适应、强化学习微调）实现跨城市泛化。

Result: 在加州三个大都市区的1.03亿条GPS记录上测试，UrbanPulse实现了最先进的准确性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: UrbanPulse通过高效迁移学习，为高分辨率、AI驱动的城市预测提供了实用解决方案，适用于多样化城市环境。

Abstract: Accurate population flow prediction is essential for urban planning,
transportation management, and public health. Yet existing methods face key
limitations: traditional models rely on static spatial assumptions, deep
learning models struggle with cross-city generalization, and Large Language
Models (LLMs) incur high computational costs while failing to capture spatial
structure. Moreover, many approaches sacrifice resolution by clustering Points
of Interest (POIs) or restricting coverage to subregions, limiting their
utility for city-wide analytics. We introduce UrbanPulse, a scalable deep
learning framework that delivers ultra-fine-grained, city-wide OD flow
predictions by treating each POI as an individual node. It combines a temporal
graph convolutional encoder with a transformer-based decoder to model
multi-scale spatiotemporal dependencies. To ensure robust generalization across
urban contexts, UrbanPulse employs a three-stage transfer learning strategy:
pretraining on large-scale urban graphs, cold-start adaptation, and
reinforcement learning fine-tuning.Evaluated on over 103 million cleaned GPS
records from three metropolitan areas in California, UrbanPulse achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability. Through efficient transfer learning,
UrbanPulse takes a key step toward making high-resolution, AI-powered urban
forecasting deployable in practice across diverse cities.

TL;DR: 论文提出MFTRR框架，通过多模态细粒度主题-帖子关系推理提升帖子质量评估，解决了现有方法的三大局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有帖子质量评估方法存在三大问题：单模态分类、多模态融合噪声、无法捕捉复杂语义关系。

Method: MFTRR框架包含局部-全局语义关联推理模块和多层次证据关系推理模块，结合多模态数据。

Result: 在三个新构建的数据集和公开数据集上，MFTRR显著优于基线方法，NDCG@3提升达9.52%。

Conclusion: MFTRR通过模仿人类认知过程，有效提升了帖子质量评估的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurately assessing post quality requires complex relational reasoning to
capture nuanced topic-post relationships. However, existing studies face three
major limitations: (1) treating the task as unimodal categorization, which
fails to leverage multimodal cues and fine-grained quality distinctions; (2)
introducing noise during deep multimodal fusion, leading to misleading signals;
and (3) lacking the ability to capture complex semantic relationships like
relevance and comprehensiveness. To address these issues, we propose the
Multimodal Fine-grained Topic-post Relational Reasoning (MFTRR) framework,
which mimics human cognitive processes. MFTRR reframes post-quality assessment
as a ranking task and incorporates multimodal data to better capture quality
variations. It consists of two key modules: (1) the Local-Global Semantic
Correlation Reasoning Module, which models fine-grained semantic interactions
between posts and topics at both local and global levels, enhanced by a maximum
information fusion mechanism to suppress noise; and (2) the Multi-Level
Evidential Relational Reasoning Module, which explores macro- and micro-level
relational cues to strengthen evidence-based reasoning. We evaluate MFTRR on
three newly constructed multimodal topic-post datasets and the public
Lazada-Home dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that MFTRR significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 9.52% NDCG@3
improvement over the best unimodal method on the Art History dataset.

Abstract: Accurate modeling and explaining geospatial tabular data (GTD) are critical
for understanding geospatial phenomena and their underlying processes. Recent
work has proposed a novel transformer-based deep learning model named
GeoAggregator (GA) for this purpose, and has demonstrated that it outperforms
other statistical and machine learning approaches. In this short paper, we
further improve GA by 1) developing an optimized pipeline that accelerates the
dataloading process and streamlines the forward pass of GA to achieve better
computational efficiency; and 2) incorporating a model ensembling strategy and
a post-hoc model explanation function based on the GeoShapley framework to
enhance model explainability. We validate the functionality and efficiency of
the proposed strategies by applying the improved GA model to synthetic
datasets. Experimental results show that our implementation improves the
prediction accuracy and inference speed of GA compared to the original
implementation. Moreover, explanation experiments indicate that GA can
effectively captures the inherent spatial effects in the designed synthetic
dataset. The complete pipeline has been made publicly available for community
use (https://github.com/ruid7181/GA-sklearn).

Motivation: 解决医疗等领域中数据隐私限制和噪声干扰导致的数据偏移分析难题。

Method: 提取隐私合规统计摘要，使用双XGBoost模型和LLM分离信号与噪声，通过Pareto加权决策树合并结果。

Result: 在MEPS数据集上F1得分为0.85，优于基线方法；在18个EHR数据集上F1为0.86-0.96（无噪声）和≥0.75（有噪声）。

Conclusion: SIFOTL提供了一种可解释、隐私保护且抗噪声的工作流。

Abstract: Identifying the factors driving data shifts in tabular datasets is a
significant challenge for analysis and decision support systems, especially
those focusing on healthcare. Privacy rules restrict data access, and noise
from complex processes hinders analysis. To address this challenge, we propose
SIFOTL (Statistically-Informed Fidelity-Optimization Method for Tabular
Learning) that (i) extracts privacy-compliant data summary statistics, (ii)
employs twin XGBoost models to disentangle intervention signals from noise with
assistance from LLMs, and (iii) merges XGBoost outputs via a Pareto-weighted
decision tree to identify interpretable segments responsible for the shift.
Unlike existing analyses which may ignore noise or require full data access for
LLM-based analysis, SIFOTL addresses both challenges using only privacy-safe
summary statistics. Demonstrating its real-world efficacy, for a MEPS panel
dataset mimicking a new Medicare drug subsidy, SIFOTL achieves an F1 score of
0.85, substantially outperforming BigQuery Contribution Analysis (F1=0.46) and
statistical tests (F1=0.20) in identifying the segment receiving the subsidy.
Furthermore, across 18 diverse EHR datasets generated based on Synthea ABM,
SIFOTL sustains F1 scores of 0.86-0.96 without noise and >= 0.75 even with
injected observational noise, whereas baseline average F1 scores range from
0.19-0.67 under the same tests. SIFOTL, therefore, provides an interpretable,
privacy-conscious workflow that is empirically robust to observational noise.

Motivation: 数据驱动的交通状态估计与预测（TSEP）依赖敏感数据，但隐私、网络安全和数据新鲜度问题可能削弱公众对智能交通系统的信任。

Method: 引入TSEP-Machine Unlearning范式，使训练后的TSEP模型能够选择性遗忘隐私敏感、污染或过时的数据。

Result: 通过让模型具备“遗忘”能力，提升了数据驱动TSEP的可信度和可靠性。

Conclusion: TSEP-Machine Unlearning为解决数据隐私和模型可靠性问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Data-driven traffic state estimation and prediction (TSEP) relies heavily on
data sources that contain sensitive information. While the abundance of data
has fueled significant breakthroughs, particularly in machine learning-based
methods, it also raises concerns regarding privacy, cybersecurity, and data
freshness. These issues can erode public trust in intelligent transportation
systems. Recently, regulations have introduced the "right to be forgotten",
allowing users to request the removal of their private data from models. As
machine learning models can remember old data, simply removing it from back-end
databases is insufficient in such systems. To address these challenges, this
study introduces a novel learning paradigm for TSEP-Machine Unlearning
TSEP-which enables a trained TSEP model to selectively forget
privacy-sensitive, poisoned, or outdated data. By empowering models to
"unlearn," we aim to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of data-driven
traffic TSEP.

Conclusion: 该方法适用于多种模型类型，为基于GRPO的高效微调提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks using
reinforcement learning methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
is computationally expensive. To address this, we propose a predictive
framework that models training dynamics and helps optimize resource usage.
Through experiments on Llama and Qwen models (3B 8B), we derive an empirical
scaling law based on model size, initial performance, and training progress.
This law predicts reward trajectories and identifies three consistent training
phases: slow start, rapid improvement, and plateau. We find that training
beyond certain number of an epoch offers little gain, suggesting earlier
stopping can significantly reduce compute without sacrificing performance. Our
approach generalizes across model types, providing a practical guide for
efficient GRPO-based fine-tuning.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of physical systems governed by partial differential

high-resolution current data are critical for coastal management, environmental
monitoring, and maritime safety. However, available satellite products, such as
Copernicus data for sea water velocity at ~0.08 degrees spatial resolution and
global ocean models, often lack the spatial granularity required for detailed
local analyses. In this work, we (a) introduce a supervised deep learning
framework based on neural operators for solving PDEs and providing arbitrary
resolution solutions, and (b) propose downscaling models with an application to
Copernicus ocean current data. Additionally, our method can model surrogate
PDEs and predict solutions at arbitrary resolution, regardless of the input
resolution. We evaluated our model on real-world Copernicus ocean current data

of GSPO have contributed to the remarkable improvements in the latest Qwen3

*Ryusei Fujimoto,Yugo Nakamura,Yutaka Arakawa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: C-AAE结合匿名自编码器和自适应差分脉冲编码调制，有效保护穿戴设备数据隐私，同时保持活动识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 穿戴设备的加速度计和陀螺仪数据可能泄露用户身份，隐私保护对医疗应用至关重要。

Method: C-AAE结合匿名自编码器（AAE）和自适应差分脉冲编码调制（ADPCM），先通过AAE提取活动特征并抑制身份信息，再用ADPCM进一步压缩和匿名化。

Result: 实验显示C-AAE将用户重识别F1分数降低10-15%，活动识别F1分数仅下降5%，数据量减少75%。

Conclusion: C-AAE在医疗传感器数据中平衡了隐私保护和实用性。

Abstract: Wearable accelerometers and gyroscopes encode fine-grained behavioural
signatures that can be exploited to re-identify users, making privacy
protection essential for healthcare applications. We introduce C-AAE, a
compressive anonymizing autoencoder that marries an Anonymizing AutoEncoder
(AAE) with Adaptive Differential Pulse-Code Modulation (ADPCM). The AAE first
projects raw sensor windows into a latent space that retains activity-relevant
features while suppressing identity cues. ADPCM then differentially encodes
this latent stream, further masking residual identity information and shrinking
the bitrate. Experiments on the MotionSense and PAMAP2 datasets show that C-AAE
cuts user re-identification F1 scores by 10-15 percentage points relative to
AAE alone, while keeping activity-recognition F1 within 5 percentage points of
the unprotected baseline. ADPCM also reduces data volume by roughly 75 %,
easing transmission and storage overheads. These results demonstrate that C-AAE
offers a practical route to balancing privacy and utility in continuous,
sensor-based activity recognition for healthcare.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Squeeze10-LLM是一种分阶段混合精度后训练量化框架，通过将80%的权重量化为1位、20%量化为4位，平均每权重1.6位，显著减少存储和加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）部署因参数庞大和计算成本高而具有挑战性，极低比特量化虽能减少存储和加速推理，但极端压缩（如平均比特宽度≤2）常导致性能严重下降。

Method: 提出Squeeze10-LLM框架，包含两个关键创新：后二值化激活鲁棒性（PBAR）和全信息激活监督（FIAS）。PBAR改进权重重要性度量，FIAS保留全激活信息以减少误差传播。

Result: 在LLaMA和LLaMA2上的实验表明，Squeeze10-LLM在亚2位权重量化中达到最先进性能，零样本分类任务平均准确率从43%提升至56%。

Conclusion: Squeeze10-LLM通过混合精度量化和创新技术，显著提升了极低比特量化下的模型性能，为LLM部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to their massive
parameters and high computational costs. Ultra low-bit quantization can
significantly reduce storage and accelerate inference, but extreme compression
(i.e., mean bit-width <= 2) often leads to severe performance degradation. To
address this, we propose Squeeze10-LLM, effectively "squeezing" 16-bit LLMs'
weights by 10 times. Specifically, Squeeze10-LLM is a staged mixed-precision
post-training quantization (PTQ) framework and achieves an average of 1.6 bits
per weight by quantizing 80% of the weights to 1 bit and 20% to 4 bits. We
introduce Squeeze10LLM with two key innovations: Post-Binarization Activation
Robustness (PBAR) and Full Information Activation Supervision (FIAS). PBAR is a
refined weight significance metric that accounts for the impact of quantization
on activations, improving accuracy in low-bit settings. FIAS is a strategy that
preserves full activation information during quantization to mitigate
cumulative error propagation across layers. Experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA2
show that Squeeze10-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance for sub-2bit
weight-only quantization, improving average accuracy from 43% to 56% on six
zero-shot classification tasks--a significant boost over existing PTQ methods.
Our code will be released upon publication.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种理论框架，通过将硬标签和额外监督信息结合生成软标签，揭示了额外监督的关键作用在于非硬标签类的分布信息，并通过实验验证了其对分类准确率的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在训练数据有限的情况下，如何利用额外监督信息（如置信度）提升分类模型的准确性。

Method: 将硬标签和额外监督信息视为概率分布，通过其仿射组合构建软标签，并进行理论分析。

Result: 额外监督的关键是非硬标签类的分布信息，其与混合系数共同优化软标签，提升分类性能。

Conclusion: 理论框架和实验表明，合理设计额外监督可显著提升分类准确率。

Abstract: In scenarios where training data is limited due to observation costs or data
scarcity, enriching the label information associated with each instance becomes
crucial for building high-accuracy classification models. In such contexts, it
is often feasible to obtain not only hard labels but also {\it additional
supervision}, such as the confidences for the hard labels. This setting
naturally raises fundamental questions: {\it What kinds of additional
supervision are intrinsically beneficial?} And {\it how do they contribute to
improved generalization performance?} To address these questions, we propose a
theoretical framework that treats both hard labels and additional supervision
as probability distributions, and constructs soft labels through their affine
combination. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the essential component of
additional supervision is not the confidence score of the assigned hard label,
but rather the information of the distribution over the non-hard-labeled
classes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the additional supervision and the
mixing coefficient contribute to the refinement of soft labels in complementary
roles. Intuitively, in the probability simplex, the additional supervision
determines the direction in which the deterministic distribution representing
the hard label should be adjusted toward the true label distribution, while the
mixing coefficient controls the step size along that direction. Through
generalization error analysis, we theoretically characterize how the additional
supervision and its mixing coefficient affect both the convergence rate and
asymptotic value of the error bound. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate
that, based on our theory, designing additional supervision can lead to
improved classification accuracy, even when utilized in a simple manner.

Motivation: 解决开放无线接入网（O-RAN）中多个移动虚拟网络运营商（MVNOs）竞争物理资源块（PRBs）的问题，同时满足客户端的概率延迟上限约束并最小化PRB利用率。

Method: 基于大数定律（LLN）推导奖励函数，提出PDA-DRL方法，并引入基于奖励的个性化模型权重共享机制。

Result: PDA-DRL方法比优化平均延迟约束的DRL模型降低了38%的平均延迟，且个性化模型权重共享方法优于传统聚合方法。

Conclusion: PDA-DRL方法在O-RAN网络切片中表现出色，个性化权重共享机制进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the challenge of radio access network (RAN) slicing
within an open RAN (O-RAN) architecture. Our focus centers on a network that
includes multiple mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) competing for
physical resource blocks (PRBs) with the goal of meeting probabilistic delay
upper bound constraints for their clients while minimizing PRB utilization.
Initially, we derive a reward function based on the law of large numbers (LLN),
then implement practical modifications to adapt it for real-world experimental
scenarios. We then propose our solution, the Percentile-based Delay-Aware Deep
Reinforcement Learning (PDA-DRL), which demonstrates its superiority over
several baselines, including DRL models optimized for average delay
constraints, by achieving a 38\% reduction in resultant average delay.
Furthermore, we delve into the issue of model weight sharing among multiple
MVNOs to develop a robust personalized model. We introduce a reward-based
personalization method where each agent prioritizes other agents' model weights
based on their performance. This technique surpasses traditional aggregation
methods, such as federated averaging, and strategies reliant on traffic
patterns and model weight distance similarities.

Conclusion: 该方法有效诱导目标代理做出次优决策，且无需修改环境，具有更高的实用性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in fields like
robotics and autonomous driving, but adversarial attacks designed to mislead RL
systems remain challenging. Existing approaches often rely on modifying the
environment or policy, limiting their practicality. This paper proposes an
adversarial attack method in which existing agents in the environment guide the
target policy to output suboptimal actions without altering the environment. We
propose a reward iteration optimization framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate adversarial rewards explicitly tailored to the
vulnerabilities of the target agent, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of
inducing the target agent toward suboptimal decision-making. Additionally, a
critical state identification algorithm is designed to pinpoint the target
agent's most vulnerable states, where suboptimal behavior from the victim leads
to significant degradation in overall performance. Experimental results in
diverse environments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
approaches.

Result: 前缀置信度扩展（仅32个标记）在准确性与计算效率上优于多数投票，且对长度偏差的敏感性较低。

Conclusion: 前缀置信度扩展是一种有效的自我改进方法，优于测试时训练和多数投票。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that language models can self-improve by maximizing
their own confidence in their predictions, without relying on external
verifiers or reward signals. In this work, we study the test-time scaling of
language models for mathematical reasoning tasks, where the model's own
confidence is used to select the most promising attempts. Surprisingly, we find
that we can achieve significant performance gains by continuing only the most
promising attempt, selected by the model's prefix-confidence. We systematically
evaluate prefix-confidence scaling on five mathematical reasoning datasets: the
school-level GSM8K and MATH500, and the competition-level AMC23, AIME24, and
AIME25. We find that prefix-confidence scaling with prefixes of only 32 tokens
achieves a better accuracy-compute trade-off than majority voting. Moreover,
prefix-confidence scaling appears less susceptible than BoN to length biases.
Finally, we also evaluate test-time training with prefix-confidence and find
that, while outperforming the base model, it does not improve over
prefix-confidence scaling.

Result: 实验表明，GraphALP在类别不平衡且标签噪声的图上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GraphALP通过结合LLM和伪标签技术，有效解决了类别不平衡和标签噪声问题。

Abstract: Class-imbalanced graph node classification is a practical yet underexplored
research problem. Although recent studies have attempted to address this issue,
they typically assume clean and reliable labels when processing
class-imbalanced graphs. This assumption often violates the nature of
real-world graphs, where labels frequently contain noise. Given this gap, this
paper systematically investigates robust node classification for
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels. We propose GraphALP, a novel Graph
Augmentation framework based on Large language models (LLMs) and
Pseudo-labeling techniques. Specifically, we design an LLM-based oversampling
method to generate synthetic minority nodes, producing label-accurate minority
nodes to alleviate class imbalance. Based on the class-balanced graphs, we
develop a dynamically weighted pseudo-labeling method to obtain high-confidence
pseudo labels to reduce label noise ratio. Additionally, we implement a
secondary LLM-guided oversampling mechanism to mitigate potential class
distribution skew caused by pseudo labels. Experimental results show that
GraphALP achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels.

Motivation: 现实数据集中噪声标签会损害深度神经网络的泛化性能，现有方法未能充分利用学习动态的时序信息。

Method: 提出ChronoSelect框架，采用四阶段记忆架构和滑动更新机制，压缩预测历史为紧凑时序分布，通过时序轨迹分析和双分支一致性实现样本分区。

Result: 理论证明框架在噪声条件下的收敛性和稳定性，实验显示其在合成和真实数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: ChronoSelect通过动态时序分析显著提升了噪声标签下的学习效果。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks on real-world datasets is often hampered by the
presence of noisy labels, which can be memorized by over-parameterized models,
leading to significant degradation in generalization performance. While
existing methods for learning with noisy labels (LNL) have made considerable
progress, they fundamentally suffer from static snapshot evaluations and fail
to leverage the rich temporal dynamics of learning evolution. In this paper, we
propose ChronoSelect (chrono denoting its temporal nature), a novel framework
featuring an innovative four-stage memory architecture that compresses
prediction history into compact temporal distributions. Our unique sliding
update mechanism with controlled decay maintains only four dynamic memory units
per sample, progressively emphasizing recent patterns while retaining essential
historical knowledge. This enables precise three-way sample partitioning into
clean, boundary, and noisy subsets through temporal trajectory analysis and
dual-branch consistency. Theoretical guarantees prove the mechanism's
convergence and stability under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ChronoSelect's state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks.

Result: 通过跨数据集评估（Argoverse2训练，NuScenes测试），验证了目标选择过程的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在未见场景中表现出更好的泛化能力，为自动驾驶环境理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: To achieve full autonomous driving, a good understanding of the surrounding
environment is necessary. Especially predicting the future states of other
traffic participants imposes a non-trivial challenge. Current SotA-models
already show promising results when trained on real datasets (e.g. Argoverse2,
NuScenes). Problems arise when these models are deployed to new/unseen areas.
Typically, performance drops significantly, indicating that the models lack
generalization. In this work, we introduce a new Graph Neural Network (GNN)
that utilizes a heterogeneous graph consisting of traffic participants and
vectorized road network. Latter, is used to classify goals, i.e. endpoints of
the predicted trajectories, in a multi-staged approach, leading to a better
generalization to unseen scenarios. We show the effectiveness of the goal
selection process via cross-dataset evaluation, i.e. training on Argoverse2 and
evaluating on NuScenes.

Motivation: 现有联邦图学习方法依赖同步通信，效率低且不实用；异步方法未考虑图数据的拓扑特性，可能导致语义漂移和表示不一致。

Method: 提出FedSA-GCL框架，结合客户端间标签分布差异和图拓扑特性，采用ClusterCast机制进行高效训练。

Conclusion: FedSA-GCL在效率和鲁棒性上表现优异，为联邦图学习提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is a distributed learning paradigm that
enables collaborative training over large-scale subgraphs located on multiple
local systems. However, most existing FGL approaches rely on synchronous
communication, which leads to inefficiencies and is often impractical in
real-world deployments. Meanwhile, current asynchronous federated learning
(AFL) methods are primarily designed for conventional tasks such as image
classification and natural language processing, without accounting for the
unique topological properties of graph data. Directly applying these methods to
graph learning can possibly result in semantic drift and representational
inconsistency in the global model. To address these challenges, we propose
FedSA-GCL, a semi-asynchronous federated framework that leverages both
inter-client label distribution divergence and graph topological
characteristics through a novel ClusterCast mechanism for efficient training.
We evaluate FedSA-GCL on multiple real-world graph datasets using the Louvain
and Metis split algorithms, and compare it against 9 baselines. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong robustness and
outstanding efficiency, outperforming the baselines by an average of 2.92% with
the Louvain and by 3.4% with the Metis.

Conclusion: SINDy-LOM通过优化库设计，提升了模型的实用性和解释性，适用于复杂系统。

Abstract: The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) approach can discover
the governing equations of dynamical systems based on measurement data, where
the dynamical model is identified as the sparse linear combination of the given
basis functions. A major challenge in SINDy is the design of a library, which
is a set of candidate basis functions, as the appropriate library is not
trivial for many dynamical systems. To overcome this difficulty, this study
proposes SINDy with library optimization mechanism (SINDy-LOM), which is a
combination of the sparse regression technique and the novel learning strategy
of the library. In the proposed approach, the basis functions are parametrized.
The SINDy-LOM approach involves a two-layer optimization architecture: the
inner-layer, in which the data-driven model is extracted as the sparse linear
combination of the candidate basis functions, and the outer-layer, in which the
basis functions are optimized from the viewpoint of the recursive long-term
(RLT) prediction accuracy; thus, the library design is reformulated as the
optimization of the parametrized basis functions. The resulting SINDy-LOM model
has good interpretability and usability, as the proposed approach yields the
parsimonious model. The library optimization mechanism significantly reduces
user burden. The RLT perspective improves the reliability of the resulting
model compared with the traditional SINDy approach that can only ensure the
one-step-ahead prediction accuracy. The validity of the proposed approach is
demonstrated by applying it to a diesel engine airpath system, which is a
well-known complex industrial system.

Abstract: Despite their theoretical appeal, totally corrective boosting methods based
on linear programming have received limited empirical attention. In this paper,
we conduct the first large-scale experimental study of six LP-based boosting
formulations, including two novel methods, NM-Boost and QRLP-Boost, across 20
diverse datasets. We evaluate the use of both heuristic and optimal base
learners within these formulations, and analyze not only accuracy, but also
ensemble sparsity, margin distribution, anytime performance, and hyperparameter
sensitivity. We show that totally corrective methods can outperform or match
state-of-the-art heuristics like XGBoost and LightGBM when using shallow trees,
while producing significantly sparser ensembles. We further show that these
methods can thin pre-trained ensembles without sacrificing performance, and we
highlight both the strengths and limitations of using optimal decision trees in
this context.

Conclusion: SiamSA-PPM为流程预测中的数据增强提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) enables forecasting future events or
outcomes of ongoing business process instances based on event logs. However,
deep learning PPM approaches are often limited by the low variability and small
size of real-world event logs. To address this, we introduce SiamSA-PPM, a
novel self-supervised learning framework that combines Siamese learning with
Statistical Augmentation for Predictive Process Monitoring. It employs three
novel statistically grounded transformation methods that leverage control-flow
semantics and frequent behavioral patterns to generate realistic, semantically
valid new trace variants. These augmented views are used within a Siamese
learning setup to learn generalizable representations of process prefixes
without the need for labeled supervision. Extensive experiments on real-life
event logs demonstrate that SiamSA-PPM achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to the SOTA in both next activity and final outcome
prediction tasks. Our results further show that statistical augmentation
significantly outperforms random transformations and improves variability in
the data, highlighting SiamSA-PPM as a promising direction for training data
enrichment in process prediction.

Abstract: Due to the high computational load of modern numerical simulation, there is a

designed algorithm on two PDEs: a linear parabolic equation which governs
slightly compressible fluid flow in porous media and the wave equation. Our
results show that in the considered scenarios, we reduced the number of grid
points up to 10 times while preserving the modeled variable dynamics in the
points of interest. The proposed approach can be applied to the simulation of

Conclusion: 该方法为解决持续学习中的安全回归问题提供了有效方案，增强了模型更新过程的可靠性。

Abstract: Malware evolves rapidly, forcing machine learning (ML)-based detectors to
adapt continuously. With antivirus vendors processing hundreds of thousands of
new samples daily, datasets can grow to billions of examples, making full
retraining impractical. Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a scalable
alternative, enabling incremental updates without full data access while
mitigating catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we analyze a critical yet
overlooked issue in this context: security regression. Unlike forgetting, which
manifests as a general performance drop on previously seen data, security
regression captures harmful prediction changes at the sample level, such as a
malware sample that was once correctly detected but evades detection after a
model update. Although often overlooked, regressions pose serious risks in
security-critical applications, as the silent reintroduction of previously
detected threats in the system may undermine users' trust in the whole updating
process. To address this issue, we formalize and quantify security regression
in CL-based malware detectors and propose a regression-aware penalty to
mitigate it. Specifically, we adapt Positive Congruent Training (PCT) to the CL
setting, preserving prior predictive behavior in a model-agnostic manner.
Experiments on the ELSA, Tesseract, and AZ-Class datasets show that our method
effectively reduces regression across different CL scenarios while maintaining
strong detection performance over time.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型架构TIDSIT，用于解决电池健康状态（SoH）估计中不规则时间序列数据的挑战，显著降低了预测误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电池健康监测对安全性和效率至关重要，但现有模型难以处理真实世界中的不规则测量数据。

Method: 提出TIDSIT架构，结合连续时间嵌入和时序注意力机制，处理非均匀间隔和变长输入。

Result: 在NASA电池退化数据集上，TIDSIT将预测误差降低50%以上，SoH误差低于0.58%。

Conclusion: TIDSIT在电池健康监测中表现优异，且适用于其他不规则时间序列任务。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of battery-powered vehicles and energy storage systems
over the past decade has made battery health monitoring increasingly critical.
Batteries play a central role in the efficiency and safety of these systems,
yet they inevitably degrade over time due to repeated charge-discharge cycles.
This degradation leads to reduced energy efficiency and potential overheating,
posing significant safety concerns. Accurate estimation of a State of Health
(SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability
and safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs,
transformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from
discharge cycle data. However, these models struggle with the irregularities
inherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at
non-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly.
To address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences
rather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and
compromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
architecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT).
TIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent
irregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention
mechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence
information. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show
that TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50%
reduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below
0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for
broader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series
data.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了多智能体强化学习（MARL）中模型简化的问题，指出当前方法依赖简单约定而非有效推理，并呼吁设计更真实的环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究当前MARL算法在Dec-POMDP框架下的局限性，揭示其成功依赖于简单约定而非环境观察与记忆。

Method: 通过案例研究分析智能体学习脆弱约定的现象，并展示任务设计对学习策略的影响。

Result: 发现当前MARL环境未能充分测试Dec-POMDP核心假设，智能体可能学习不稳定的约定。

Conclusion: 建议设计新环境，强调基于观察的行为和记忆推理，以促进真正技能的培养。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is typically formalised
as a Decentralised Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP),
where agents must reason about the environment and other agents' behaviour. In
practice, current model-free MARL algorithms use simple recurrent function
approximators to address the challenge of reasoning about others using partial
information. In this position paper, we argue that the empirical success of
these methods is not due to effective Markov signal recovery, but rather to
learning simple conventions that bypass environment observations and memory.
Through a targeted case study, we show that co-adapting agents can learn
brittle conventions, which then fail when partnered with non-adaptive agents.
Crucially, the same models can learn grounded policies when the task design
necessitates it, revealing that the issue is not a fundamental limitation of
the learning models but a failure of the benchmark design. Our analysis also
suggests that modern MARL environments may not adequately test the core
assumptions of Dec-POMDPs. We therefore advocate for new cooperative
environments built upon two core principles: (1) behaviours grounded in
observations and (2) memory-based reasoning about other agents, ensuring
success requires genuine skill rather than fragile, co-adapted agreements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决HyperDeepONets因高参数数量导致的高内存和计算成本问题。

Method: 利用LoRA将超网络的输出层权重矩阵分解为两个低秩矩阵，减少参数并引入额外正则化。

Result: 在常微分方程和偏微分方程实验中，参数减少70%，预测准确性和泛化能力优于常规HyperDeepONets。

Conclusion: PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets在减少复杂度的同时提升了性能，适用于物理信息机器学习。

Abstract: HyperDeepONets were introduced in Lee, Cho and Hwang [ICLR, 2023] as an
alternative architecture for operator learning, in which a hypernetwork
generates the weights for the trunk net of a DeepONet. While this improves
expressivity, it incurs high memory and computational costs due to the large
number of output parameters required. In this work we introduce, in the
physics-informed machine learning setting, a variation, PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets,
which leverage low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to reduce complexity by decomposing
the hypernetwork's output layer weight matrix into two smaller low-rank
matrices. This reduces the number of trainable parameters while introducing an
extra regularization of the trunk networks' weights. Through extensive
experiments on both ordinary and partial differential equations we show that
PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets achieve up to 70\% reduction in parameters and
consistently outperform regular HyperDeepONets in terms of predictive accuracy
and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统贝叶斯和集成方法在LLMs中进行不确定性量化需要高计算成本，亟需一种高效且不牺牲性能的替代方案。

Method: 通过将需要多次前向传播的不确定性感知教师模型蒸馏为紧凑的学生模型，采用LoRA微调，并比较了基于softmax和Dirichlet分布的两种蒸馏策略。

Result: 实验表明，学生模型在单次前向传播下，预测和不确定性量化性能与教师模型相当或更优。

Conclusion: 这是首次证明通过证据蒸馏可以在LLMs中实现即时且鲁棒的不确定性量化。

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification remains a key challenge for standard
LLMs, prompting the adoption of Bayesian and ensemble-based methods. However,
such methods typically necessitate computationally expensive sampling,
involving multiple forward passes to effectively estimate predictive
uncertainty.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel approach enabling efficient and effective
uncertainty estimation in LLMs without sacrificing performance. Specifically,
we distill uncertainty-aware teacher models - originally requiring multiple
forward passes - into compact student models sharing the same architecture but
fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We compare two distinct
distillation strategies: one in which the student employs traditional
softmax-based outputs, and another in which the student leverages
Dirichlet-distributed outputs to explicitly model epistemic uncertainty via
evidential learning.
  Empirical evaluations on classification datasets demonstrate that such
students can achieve comparable or superior predictive and uncertainty
quantification performance relative to their teacher models, while critically
requiring only a single forward pass. To our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration that immediate and robust uncertainty quantification can be
achieved in LLMs through evidential distillation.

Abstract: With the global population growing and arable land resources becoming
increasingly scarce,smart agriculture and precision agriculture have emerged as
key directions for the future ofagricultural development.Artificial
intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly deep learning models, have found
widespread applications in areas such as crop monitoring and pest detection. As
an emerging generative model, diffusion models have shown significant promise
in tasks like agricultural image processing, data augmentation, and remote
sensing. Compared to traditional generative adversarial networks (GANs),
diffusion models offer superior training stability and generation quality,
effectively addressing challenges such as limited agricultural data and
imbalanced image samples. This paper reviews the latest advancements in the
application of diffusion models in agriculture, focusing on their potential in
crop pest and disease detection, remote sensing image enhancement, crop growth
prediction, and agricultural resource management. Experimental results
demonstrate that diffusion models significantly improve model accuracy and
robustness in data augmentation, image generation, and denoising, especially in
complex environments. Despite challenges related to computational efficiency
and generalization capabilities, diffusion models are expected to play an
increasingly important role in smart and precision agriculture as technology
advances, providing substantial support for the sustainable development of
global agriculture.

TL;DR: HYPER是一种结合多模型集成和储层计算的新方法，用于在数据稀缺条件下高效、准确地预测河流流量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多地区缺乏足够的河流流量观测数据，限制了降雨-径流分析的准确性。现有模型在数据稀缺条件下难以同时实现高精度、可解释性和计算效率。

Method: HYPER首先对43个未校准的概念水文模型应用贝叶斯模型平均（BMA），然后通过储层计算（RC）模型进行误差校正。对于无测站流域，通过链接测站流域属性推断BMA和RC权重。

Result: 在数据丰富和稀缺场景下，HYPER均表现优异（KGE分别为0.56和0.55），计算效率高（仅需LSTM的5%时间）。

Conclusion: HYPER为无测站流域提供了一种高效、稳健且通用的流量预测解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the critical need for accurate flood prediction and water management,
many regions lack sufficient river discharge observations, limiting the skill
of rainfall-runoff analyses. Although numerous physically based and machine
learning models exist, achieving high accuracy, interpretability, and
computational efficiency under data-scarce conditions remains a major
challenge. We address this challenge with a novel method, HYdrological
Prediction with multi-model Ensemble and Reservoir computing (HYPER) that
leverages multi-model ensemble and reservoir computing (RC). Our approach first
applies Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to 43 "uncalibrated" catchment-based
conceptual hydrological models. An RC model is then trained via linear
regression to correct errors in the BMA output, a non-iterative process that
ensures high computational efficiency. For ungauged basins, we infer the
required BMA and RC weights by linking them to catchment attributes from gauged
basins, creating a generalizable framework. We evaluated HYPER using data from
87 river basins in Japan. In a data-rich scenario, HYPER (median Kling-Gupta
Efficiency, KGE, of 0.56) performed comparably to a benchmark LSTM (KGE 0.55)
but required only 5% of its computational time. In a data-scarce scenario (23%
of basins gauged), HYPER maintained robust performance (KGE 0.55) and lower
uncertainty, whereas the LSTM's performance degraded significantly (KGE -0.04).
These results reveal that individual conceptual hydrological models do not
necessarily need to be calibrated when an effectively large ensemble is
assembled and combined with machine-learning-based bias correction. HYPER
provides a robust, efficient, and generalizable solution for discharge
prediction, particularly in ungauged basins, making it applicable to a wide
range of regions.

Conclusion: 改进的双模拟度量解决了传统方法的局限性，提升了强化学习任务的性能。

Abstract: Bisimulation metric has long been regarded as an effective control-related
representation learning technique in various reinforcement learning tasks.
However, in this paper, we identify two main issues with the conventional
bisimulation metric: 1) an inability to represent certain distinctive
scenarios, and 2) a reliance on predefined weights for differences in rewards
and subsequent states during recursive updates. We find that the first issue
arises from an imprecise definition of the reward gap, whereas the second issue
stems from overlooking the varying importance of reward difference and
next-state distinctions across different training stages and task settings. To
address these issues, by introducing a measure for state-action pairs, we
propose a revised bisimulation metric that features a more precise definition
of reward gap and novel update operators with adaptive coefficient. We also
offer theoretical guarantees of convergence for our proposed metric and its
improved representation distinctiveness. In addition to our rigorous
theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments on two representative
benchmarks, DeepMind Control and Meta-World, demonstrating the effectiveness of
our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN在异质图（连接节点特征或标签不同）上表现不佳，主要因邻居聚合和结构模式利用不足。

Method: GLANCE结合逻辑层（生成可解释嵌入）、多头注意力边剪枝（去噪图结构）和聚类机制（捕捉全局模式）。

Result: 在Cornell、Texas和Wisconsin等基准数据集上，GLANCE表现优异，提供鲁棒且可解释的解决方案。

Conclusion: GLANCE轻量、适应性强，专为异质图挑战设计，性能优越。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success in
learning from graph-structured data but often struggle on heterophilous graphs,
where connected nodes differ in features or class labels. This limitation
arises from indiscriminate neighbor aggregation and insufficient incorporation
of higher-order structural patterns. To address these challenges, we propose
GLANCE (Graph Logic Attention Network with Cluster Enhancement), a novel
framework that integrates logic-guided reasoning, dynamic graph refinement, and
adaptive clustering to enhance graph representation learning. GLANCE combines a
logic layer for interpretable and structured embeddings, multi-head
attention-based edge pruning for denoising graph structures, and clustering
mechanisms for capturing global patterns. Experimental results in benchmark
datasets, including Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin, demonstrate that GLANCE
achieves competitive performance, offering robust and interpretable solutions
for heterophilous graph scenarios. The proposed framework is lightweight,
adaptable, and uniquely suited to the challenges of heterophilous graphs.

Abstract: We introduce C2G-KD, a data-free knowledge distillation framework where a
class-conditional generator is trained to produce synthetic samples guided by a
frozen teacher model and geometric constraints derived from PCA. The generator
never observes real training data but instead learns to activate the teacher's
output through a combination of semantic and structural losses. By constraining
generated samples to lie within class-specific PCA subspaces estimated from as
few as two real examples per class, we preserve topological consistency and
diversity. Experiments on MNIST show that even minimal class structure is
sufficient to bootstrap useful synthetic training pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Diverse learning algorithms, optimization methods, and natural selection
share a common mathematical structure, despite their apparent differences. Here
I show that a simple notational partitioning of change by the Price equation
reveals a universal force-metric-bias (FMB) law: $\Delta\mathbf{\theta} =
\mathbf{M}\,\mathbf{f} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{\xi}$. The force $\mathbf{f}$
drives improvement in parameters, $\Delta\mathbf{\theta}$, through the
covariance between the parameters and performance. The metric $\mathbf{M}$
rescales movement by inverse curvature. The bias $\mathbf{b}$ adds momentum or
changes in the frame of reference. The noise $\mathbf{\xi}$ enables
exploration. This framework unifies natural selection, Bayesian updating,
Newton's method, stochastic gradient descent, stochastic Langevin dynamics,
Adam optimization, and most other algorithms as special cases of the same
underlying process. The Price equation also reveals why Fisher information,
Kullback-Leibler divergence, and d'Alembert's principle arise naturally in
learning dynamics. By exposing this common structure, the FMB law provides a
principled foundation for understanding, comparing, and designing learning
algorithms across disciplines.

Conclusion: 该研究为GPTQ提供了理论基础，并启发了未来量化算法的设计。

Abstract: Quantizing the weights of large language models (LLMs) from 16-bit to lower
bitwidth is the de facto approach to deploy massive transformers onto more
affordable accelerators. GPTQ emerged as one of the standard methods for
one-shot post-training quantization at LLM scale. Yet, its inner workings are
described as a sequence of ad-hoc algebraic updates that obscure any geometric
meaning or worst-case guarantees. In this work, we show that, when executed
back-to-front (from the last to first dimension) for a linear layer, GPTQ is
mathematically identical to Babai's nearest plane algorithm for the classical
closest vector problem (CVP) on a lattice defined by the Hessian matrix of the
layer's inputs. This equivalence is based on a sophisticated mathematical
argument, and has two analytical consequences: (i) the GPTQ error propagation
step gains an intuitive geometric interpretation; (ii) GPTQ inherits the error
upper bound of Babai's algorithm under the no-clipping condition. Taken
together, these results place GPTQ on firm theoretical footing and open the
door to importing decades of progress in lattice algorithms towards the design
of future quantization algorithms for billion-parameter models.

Conclusion: 该方法为公平性测试中的数据稀缺问题提供了解决方案，支持独立且模型无关的公平性评估。

Abstract: As AI becomes prevalent in high-risk domains and decision-making, it is
essential to test for potential harms and biases. This urgency is reflected by
the global emergence of AI regulations that emphasise fairness and adequate
testing, with some mandating independent bias audits. However, procuring the
necessary data for fairness testing remains a significant challenge.
Particularly in industry settings, legal and privacy concerns restrict the
collection of demographic data required to assess group disparities, and
auditors face practical and cultural challenges in gaining access to data.
Further, internal historical datasets are often insufficiently representative
to identify real-world biases. This work focuses on evaluating classifier
fairness when complete datasets including demographics are inaccessible. We
propose leveraging separate overlapping datasets to construct complete
synthetic data that includes demographic information and accurately reflects
the underlying relationships between protected attributes and model features.
We validate the fidelity of the synthetic data by comparing it to real data,
and empirically demonstrate that fairness metrics derived from testing on such
synthetic data are consistent with those obtained from real data. This work,
therefore, offers a path to overcome real-world data scarcity for fairness
testing, enabling independent, model-agnostic evaluation of fairness, and
serving as a viable substitute where real data is limited.

Abstract: Processing spatial data is a key component in many learning tasks for
autonomous driving such as motion forecasting, multi-agent simulation, and
planning. Prior works have demonstrated the value in using SE(2) invariant
network architectures that consider only the relative poses between objects
(e.g. other agents, scene features such as traffic lanes). However, these
methods compute the relative poses for all pairs of objects explicitly,
requiring quadratic memory. In this work, we propose a mechanism for SE(2)
invariant scaled dot-product attention that requires linear memory relative to
the number of objects in the scene. Our SE(2) invariant transformer
architecture enjoys the same scaling properties that have benefited large
language models in recent years. We demonstrate experimentally that our
approach is practical to implement and improves performance compared to
comparable non-invariant architectures.

Abstract: Generating novel and functional protein sequences is critical to a wide range
of applications in biology. Recent advancements in conditional diffusion models
have shown impressive empirical performance in protein generation tasks.
However, reliable generations of protein remain an open research question in de
novo protein design, especially when it comes to conditional diffusion models.
Considering the biological function of a protein is determined by multi-level
structures, we propose a novel multi-level conditional diffusion model that
integrates both sequence-based and structure-based information for efficient
end-to-end protein design guided by specified functions. By generating
representations at different levels simultaneously, our framework can
effectively model the inherent hierarchical relations between different levels,
resulting in an informative and discriminative representation of the generated
protein. We also propose a Protein-MMD, a new reliable evaluation metric, to
evaluate the quality of generated protein with conditional diffusion models.
Our new metric is able to capture both distributional and functional
similarities between real and generated protein sequences while ensuring
conditional consistency. We experiment with the benchmark datasets, and the
results on conditional protein generation tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed generation framework and evaluation metric.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决物理环境中人机协作的复杂性，如连续状态-动作空间和物理约束带来的挑战。

Method: 提出了BASS方法（行为增强、模拟和选择），通过增强代理的多样性和对动作结果的理解来优化协作。

Result: 实验表明，BASS在AI-AI和人机协作中优于现有模型。

Conclusion: Moving Out基准和BASS方法为物理环境中的人机协作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The ability to adapt to physical actions and constraints in an environment is
crucial for embodied agents (e.g., robots) to effectively collaborate with
humans. Such physically grounded human-AI collaboration must account for the
increased complexity of the continuous state-action space and constrained
dynamics caused by physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce
\textit{Moving Out}, a new human-AI collaboration benchmark that resembles a
wide range of collaboration modes affected by physical attributes and
constraints, such as moving heavy items together and maintaining consistent
actions to move a big item around a corner. Using Moving Out, we designed two
tasks and collected human-human interaction data to evaluate models' abilities
to adapt to diverse human behaviors and unseen physical attributes. To address
the challenges in physical environments, we propose a novel method, BASS
(Behavior Augmentation, Simulation, and Selection), to enhance the diversity of
agents and their understanding of the outcome of actions. Our experiments show
that BASS outperforms state-of-the-art models in AI-AI and human-AI
collaboration. The project page is available at

Conclusion: 系统成功实现了高效、低功耗的实时步态识别，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: This project presents the development of a gait recognition system using Tiny
Machine Learning (Tiny ML) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors. The
system leverages the XIAO-nRF52840 Sense microcontroller and the LSM6DS3 IMU
sensor to capture motion data, including acceleration and angular velocity,
from four distinct activities: walking, stationary, going upstairs, and going
downstairs. The data collected is processed through Edge Impulse, an edge AI
platform, which enables the training of machine learning models that can be
deployed directly onto the microcontroller for real-time activity
classification.The data preprocessing step involves extracting relevant
features from the raw sensor data using techniques such as sliding windows and
data normalization, followed by training a Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier
for activity recognition. The model achieves over 80% accuracy on a test
dataset, demonstrating its ability to classify the four activities effectively.
Additionally, the platform enables anomaly detection, further enhancing the
robustness of the system. The integration of Tiny ML ensures low-power
operation, making it suitable for battery-powered or energy-harvesting devices.

Systems (ADAS) capabilities. The process starts with requirements as input,
while the main generated outputs are test scenario code for simulation
environment, together with implementation of desired ADAS capabilities

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动代码审查主观性强且耗时，而现有AI方法（如LLMs）缺乏逻辑推理能力，无法完全理解和评估代码。

Method: 采用符号推理技术与LLMs结合的混合方法，并在CodexGlue数据集上测试，比较了CodeT5、CodeBERT和GraphCodeBERT等模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提升了自动化代码审查的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: 结合符号推理与LLMs的混合方法是自动化代码审查的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Code review is one of the key processes in the software development lifecycle
and is essential to maintain code quality. However, manual code review is
subjective and time consuming. Given its rule-based nature, code review is well
suited for automation. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to
automate this process with the help of artificial intelligence. Recent
developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have also emerged as a promising
tool in this area, but these models often lack the logical reasoning
capabilities needed to fully understand and evaluate code. To overcome this
limitation, this study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates symbolic
reasoning techniques with LLMs to automate the code review process. We tested
our approach using the CodexGlue dataset, comparing several models, including
CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT, to assess the effectiveness of combining
symbolic reasoning and prompting techniques with LLMs. Our results show that
this approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of automated code review.

*Juntao Zhao,Jiuru Li,Chuan Wu*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: Sandwich是一种基于CPU的LLM服务引擎，通过优化预填充和解码阶段的执行计划，显著提升了性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CPU的解决方案忽略了LLM推理中预填充和解码阶段的工作负载差异，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出Sandwich引擎，针对预填充和解码阶段分别优化执行计划，并在多种CPU平台上进行评估。

Result: Sandwich在吞吐量、延迟和资源需求方面均有显著提升，生成的GEMM内核性能优于现有解决方案。

Conclusion: Sandwich为CPU上的LLM服务提供了一种高效且资源友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Utilizing CPUs to serve large language models (LLMs) is a resource-friendly
alternative to GPU serving. Existing CPU-based solutions ignore workload
differences between the prefill and the decode phases of LLM inference,
applying a static per-NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) node model partition and
utilizing vendor libraries for operator-level execution, which is suboptimal.
We propose Sandwich, a hardware-centric CPU-based LLM serving engine that uses
different execution plans for the prefill and decode phases and optimizes them
separately.
  We evaluate Sandwich across diverse baselines and datasets on five CPU
platforms, including x86 with AVX-2 and AVX-512, as well as ARM with NEON.
Sandwich achieves an average 2.01x throughput improvement and 90% satisfactory
time-to-first-token (TTFT) and time-per-output-token (TPOT) latencies with up
to 3.40x lower requirements in single sequence serving, and significant
improvement in Goodput in continuous-batching serving. The GEMM kernels
generated by Sandwich outperform representative vendor kernels and other
dynamic shape solutions, achieving performance comparable to static compilers
with three orders of magnitude less kernel tuning costs.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文探讨了银河中心过剩（GCE）的起源，通过神经网络辅助的模拟推理方法结合空间和光谱数据，发现GCE更可能是弥散性质或由大量点源组成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GCE的起源尚未明确，可能是暗物质湮灭或点源群体。此前研究因技术限制仅从空间角度分析，缺乏光谱信息。

Method: 采用神经网络辅助的模拟推理方法，结合空间和光谱数据，分析GCE的性质。

Result: 光谱信息显示点源需更暗，GCE可能是弥散性质或由大量点源（约10^5个）组成。与暗物质的Poisson发射一致。

Conclusion: GCE更可能是弥散性质或由大量点源组成，而非此前认为的少量点源。

Abstract: The Galactic Center Excess (GCE) remains one of the defining mysteries
uncovered by the Fermi $\gamma$-ray Space Telescope. Although it may yet herald
the discovery of annihilating dark matter, weighing against that conclusion are
analyses showing the spatial structure of the emission appears more consistent
with a population of dim point sources. Technical limitations have restricted
prior analyses to studying the point-source hypothesis purely spatially. All
spectral information that could help disentangle the GCE from the complex and
uncertain astrophysical emission was discarded. We demonstrate that a neural
network-aided simulation-based inference approach can overcome such limitations
and thereby confront the point source explanation of the GCE with spatial and
spectral data. The addition is profound: energy information drives the putative
point sources to be significantly dimmer, indicating either the GCE is truly
diffuse in nature or made of an exceptionally large number of sources.
Quantitatively, for our best fit background model, the excess is essentially
consistent with Poisson emission as predicted by dark matter. If the excess is
instead due to point sources, our median prediction is ${\cal O}(10^5)$ sources
in the Galactic Center, or more than 35,000 sources at 90% confidence, both
significantly larger than the hundreds of sources preferred by earlier
point-source analyses of the GCE.

*Elyar Tourani,Brian J. Edwards,Bamin Khomami*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于机器学习的集成工作流，用于准确量化聚合物系统中的结晶度，通过多维特征和低维嵌入实现高精度分类，并定义了结晶指数（C-index）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法基于预设的单一序参量（OP）存在系统偏差和敏感性，需要更准确的数据驱动策略来量化结晶度。

Method: 结合几何、热力学和对称性描述符构建高维特征向量，通过低维嵌入和无监督聚类识别结晶与非晶原子，再用监督学习筛选最小OP集。

Result: 仅需三个OP即可重现结晶标签，C-index分类性能超过0.98（AUC），并支持动态计算结晶度。

Conclusion: 该工作流为OP选择提供了数据驱动方法，并揭示了结晶过程中熵和对称性的动态作用。

Abstract: Currently, identification of crystallization pathways in polymers is being
carried out using molecular simulation-based data on a preset cut-off point on
a single order parameter (OP) to define nucleated or crystallized regions.
Aside from sensitivity to cut-off, each of these OPs introduces its own
systematic biases. In this study, an integrated machine learning workflow is
presented to accurately quantify crystallinity in polymeric systems using
atomistic molecular dynamics data. Each atom is represented by a
high-dimensional feature vector that combines geometric, thermodynamic-like,
and symmetry-based descriptors. Low dimensional embeddings are employed to
expose latent structural fingerprints within atomic environments. Subsequently,
unsupervised clustering on the embeddings identified crystalline and amorphous
atoms with high fidelity. After generating high quality labels with
multidimensional data, we use supervised learning techniques to identify a
minimal set of order parameters that can fully capture this label. Various
tests were conducted to reduce the feature set, demonstrating that using only
three order parameters is sufficient to recreate the crystallization labels.
Based on these observed OPs, the crystallinity index (C-index) is defined as
the logistic regression model's probability of crystallinity, remaining bimodal
throughout the process and achieving over 0.98 classification performance
(AUC). Notably, a model trained on one or a few snapshots enables efficient
on-the-fly computation of crystallinity. Lastly, we demonstrate how the optimal
C-index fit evolves during various stages of crystallization, supporting the
hypothesis that entropy dominates early nucleation, while symmetry gains
relevance later. This workflow provides a data-driven strategy for OP selection
and a metric to monitor structural transformations in large-scale polymer
simulations.

Method: 提出Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting（APT）攻击方法，通过同音替换歌词测试模型的记忆性，并利用音频和视觉指标评估相似性。

Result: 发现模型会生成与训练数据高度相似的音频和视觉内容，揭示了跨模态的记忆漏洞。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了现代生成系统在音频和视觉领域的记忆性问题，对版权、安全和内容来源提出了紧迫问题。

Abstract: Lyrics-to-Song (LS2) generation models promise end-to-end music synthesis
from text, yet their vulnerability to training data memorization remains
underexplored. We introduce Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), a novel
attack where lyrics are semantically altered while preserving their acoustic
structure through homophonic substitutions (e.g., Eminem's famous "mom's
spaghetti" $\rightarrow$ "Bob's confetti"). Despite these distortions, we
uncover a powerful form of sub-lexical memorization: models like SUNO and YuE
regenerate outputs strikingly similar to known training content, achieving high
similarity across audio-domain metrics, including CLAP, AudioJudge, and
CoverID. This vulnerability persists across multiple languages and genres. More
surprisingly, we discover that phoneme-altered lyrics alone can trigger visual
memorization in text-to-video models. When prompted with phonetically modified
lyrics from Lose Yourself, Veo 3 reconstructs visual elements from the original
music video -- including character appearance and scene composition -- despite
no visual cues in the prompt. We term this phenomenon phonetic-to-visual
regurgitation. Together, these findings expose a critical vulnerability in
transcript-conditioned multimodal generation: phonetic prompting alone can
unlock memorized audiovisual content, raising urgent questions about copyright,
safety, and content provenance in modern generative systems. Example
generations are available on our demo page (jrohsc.github.io/music_attack/).

to extremely high dimensions, and we provide a real-data example that

applicable to A/B testing. This paper introduces a two-armed bandit framework

consists of three main steps: (i) employing doubly robust estimation to
generate pseudo-outcomes, (ii) utilizing a two-armed bandit framework to
construct the test statistic, and (iii) applying a permutation-based method to
compute the $p$-value. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自适应集成方法通常依赖粗粒度机制或简单投票方案，无法充分利用专家知识。

Method: DriftMoE采用紧凑的神经路由器和增量Hoeffding树专家池，通过协同学习循环实现专家专业化。

Result: 在九种数据流学习基准测试中，DriftMoE表现优异，与最先进的自适应集成方法竞争。

Conclusion: DriftMoE为概念漂移适应提供了一种高效且原则性的方法，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Learning from non-stationary data streams subject to concept drift requires
models that can adapt on-the-fly while remaining resource-efficient. Existing
adaptive ensemble methods often rely on coarse-grained adaptation mechanisms or
simple voting schemes that fail to optimally leverage specialized knowledge.
This paper introduces DriftMoE, an online Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
that addresses these limitations through a novel co-training framework.
DriftMoE features a compact neural router that is co-trained alongside a pool
of incremental Hoeffding tree experts. The key innovation lies in a symbiotic
learning loop that enables expert specialization: the router selects the most
suitable expert for prediction, the relevant experts update incrementally with
the true label, and the router refines its parameters using a multi-hot
correctness mask that reinforces every accurate expert. This feedback loop
provides the router with a clear training signal while accelerating expert
specialization. We evaluate DriftMoE's performance across nine state-of-the-art
data stream learning benchmarks spanning abrupt, gradual, and real-world drifts
testing two distinct configurations: one where experts specialize on data
regimes (multi-class variant), and another where they focus on single-class
specialization (task-based variant). Our results demonstrate that DriftMoE
achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art stream learning adaptive
ensembles, offering a principled and efficient approach to concept drift
adaptation. All code, data pipelines, and reproducibility scripts are available

Result: 理论保证噪声和距离的估计误差以多项式速率收敛为零，实验验证了方法的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了距离计算的鲁棒性，在单细胞RNA测序等应用中表现优异。

Abstract: Pairwise Euclidean distance calculation is a fundamental step in many machine
learning and data analysis algorithms. In real-world applications, however,
these distances are frequently distorted by heteroskedastic
noise$\unicode{x2014}$a prevalent form of inhomogeneous corruption
characterized by variable noise magnitudes across data observations. Such noise
inflates the computed distances in a nontrivial way, leading to
misrepresentations of the underlying data geometry. In this work, we address
the tasks of estimating the noise magnitudes per observation and correcting the
pairwise Euclidean distances under heteroskedastic noise. Perhaps surprisingly,
we show that in general high-dimensional settings and without assuming prior
knowledge on the clean data structure or noise distribution, both tasks can be
performed reliably, even when the noise levels vary considerably. Specifically,
we develop a principled, hyperparameter-free approach that jointly estimates
the noise magnitudes and corrects the distances. We provide theoretical
guarantees for our approach, establishing probabilistic bounds on the
estimation errors of both noise magnitudes and distances. These bounds,
measured in the normalized $\ell_1$ norm, converge to zero at polynomial rates
as both feature dimension and dataset size increase. Experiments on synthetic
datasets demonstrate that our method accurately estimates distances in
challenging regimes, significantly improving the robustness of subsequent
distance-based computations. Notably, when applied to single-cell RNA
sequencing data, our method yields noise magnitude estimates consistent with an
established prototypical model, enabling accurate nearest neighbor
identification that is fundamental to many downstream analyses.

Motivation: 高维系统中量纲分析产生的冗余参数难以建立物理意义描述，需要一种新方法简化复杂性并揭示内在规律。

Method: 结合量纲分析和符号回归的物理-数据混合驱动方法（Hi-π），自动提取关键无量纲参数组合。

Result: 在Rayleigh-Bénard对流、圆管粘性流动和亚音速流动压缩性修正中，成功提取经典无量纲参数，验证了方法的准确性和普适性。

Conclusion: Hi-π方法能有效简化高维系统，自动发现关键无量纲参数，为多尺度数据提供统一描述。

Abstract: Dimensional analysis provides a universal framework for reducing physical
complexity and reveal inherent laws. However, its application to
high-dimensional systems still generates redundant dimensionless parameters,
making it challenging to establish physically meaningful descriptions. Here, we
introduce Hierarchical Dimensionless Learning (Hi-{\pi}), a physics-data
hybrid-driven method that combines dimensional analysis and symbolic regression
to automatically discover key dimensionless parameter combination(s). We
applied this method to classic examples in various research fields of fluid
mechanics. For the Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, this method accurately
extracted two intrinsic dimensionless parameters: the Rayleigh number and the
Prandtl number, validating its unified representation advantage across
multiscale data. For the viscous flows in a circular pipe, the method
automatically discovers two optimal dimensionless parameters: the Reynolds
number and relative roughness, achieving a balance between accuracy and
complexity. For the compressibility correction in subsonic flow, the method
effectively extracts the classic compressibility correction formulation, while
demonstrating its capability to discover hierarchical structural expressions
through optimal parameter transformations.

Method: 使用TxGraffiti系统生成猜想，结合数学家定义的启发式规则，并通过数百个图进行实证验证。

Conclusion: 这些猜想不仅是数学挑战，也反映了机器在数学创造性过程中的作用，旨在激发人类与AI的合作与思考。

Abstract: We present four open conjectures in graph theory generated by the automated
conjecturing system \texttt{TxGraffiti}. Each conjecture is concise, grounded
in natural graph invariants, and empirically validated across hundreds of
graphs. Despite extensive effort, these statements remain unresolved--defying
both proof and counterexample. They are not only mathematical challenges but
creative expressions--born of symbolic pattern recognition and
mathematician-defined heuristics, refined through years of human dialogue, and
now offered back to the community as collaborative artifacts. These conjectures
invite not only formal proof, but also reflection on how machines can evoke
wonder, spark curiosity, and contribute to the raw material of discovery. By
highlighting these problems, we aim to inspire both human mathematicians and AI
systems to engage with them--not only to solve them, but to reflect on what it
means when machines participate meaningfully in the creative process of
mathematical thought.

Abstract: Contemporary database systems, while effective, suffer severe issues related
to complexity and usability, especially among individuals who lack technical
expertise but are unfamiliar with query languages like Structured Query
Language (SQL). This paper presents a new database system supported by
Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is intended to improve the management of
data using natural language processing (NLP) - based intuitive interfaces, and
automatic creation of structured queries and semi-structured data formats like
yet another markup language (YAML), java script object notation (JSON), and
application program interface (API) documentation. The system is intended to
strengthen the potential of databases through the integration of Large Language
Models (LLMs) and advanced machine learning algorithms. The integration is
purposed to allow the automation of fundamental tasks such as data modeling,
schema creation, query comprehension, and performance optimization. We present
in this paper a system that aims to alleviate the main problems with current
database technologies. It is meant to reduce the need for technical skills,
manual tuning for better performance, and the potential for human error. The AI
database employs generative schema inference and format selection to build its
schema models and execution formats.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究log-concave采样的查询复杂度，特别是通过成员资格查询均匀采样凸体，以优化采样效率。

Method: 提出了一种改进的近端采样器，结合退火方案生成温暖的初始状态，并利用超收缩性和对数Sobolev不等式改进混合保证。

Result: 采样器在特定条件下实现了查询复杂度的优化，退火方案生成了温暖的初始状态，适用于一般log-concave分布。

Conclusion: 研究扩展了log-concave采样的理论框架，提供了高效的采样方法，适用于更广泛的分布类型。

Abstract: We study the zeroth-order query complexity of log-concave sampling,
specifically uniform sampling from convex bodies using membership oracles. We
propose a simple variant of the proximal sampler that achieves the query
complexity with matched R\'enyi orders between the initial warmness and output
guarantee. Specifically, for any $\varepsilon>0$ and $q\geq2$, the sampler,
initialized at $\pi_{0}$, outputs a sample whose law is $\varepsilon$-close in
$q$-R\'enyi divergence to $\pi$, the uniform distribution over a convex body in
$\mathbb{R}^{d}$, using
$\widetilde{O}(qM_{q}^{q/(q-1)}d^{2}\,\lVert\operatorname{cov}\pi\rVert\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$
membership queries, where
$M_{q}=\lVert\text{d}\pi_{0}/\text{d}\pi\rVert_{L^{q}(\pi)}$.
  We further introduce a simple annealing scheme that produces a warm start in
$q$-R\'enyi divergence (i.e., $M_{q}=O(1)$) using
$\widetilde{O}(qd^{2}R^{3/2}\,\lVert\operatorname{cov}\pi\rVert^{1/4})$
queries, where $R^{2}=\mathbb{E}_{\pi}[|\cdot|^{2}]$. This interpolates between
known complexities for warm-start generation in total variation and
R\'enyi-infinity divergence. To relay a R\'enyi warmness across the annealing
scheme, we establish hypercontractivity under simultaneous heat flow and
translate it into an improved mixing guarantee for the proximal sampler under a
logarithmic Sobolev inequality. These results extend naturally to general
log-concave distributions accessible via evaluation oracles, incurring
additional quadratic queries.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 强化学习（RL）应用于经济建模时，揭示了均衡理论与学习代理行为之间的冲突。本文提出了一种校准的均值场强化学习框架，以解决这一冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统经济模型假设原子代理是市场条件的接受者，而RL代理倾向于成为环境的操纵者，导致非均衡行为。

Method: 提出校准的均值场强化学习框架，将代表性代理嵌入固定宏观经济场，并调整成本函数以反映经济机会成本。

Result: 迭代算法收敛到自洽固定点，代理策略与竞争均衡一致。

Conclusion: 该方法为计算社会科学中经济系统的学习代理建模提供了可行且理论可靠的方法。

Abstract: The application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to economic modeling reveals a
fundamental conflict between the assumptions of equilibrium theory and the
emergent behavior of learning agents. While canonical economic models assume
atomistic agents act as `takers' of aggregate market conditions, a naive
single-agent RL simulation incentivizes the agent to become a `manipulator' of
its environment. This paper first demonstrates this discrepancy within a
search-and-matching model with concave production, showing that a standard RL
agent learns a non-equilibrium, monopsonistic policy. Additionally, we identify
a parametric bias arising from the mismatch between economic discounting and
RL's treatment of intertemporal costs. To address both issues, we propose a
calibrated Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning framework that embeds a
representative agent in a fixed macroeconomic field and adjusts the cost
function to reflect economic opportunity costs. Our iterative algorithm
converges to a self-consistent fixed point where the agent's policy aligns with
the competitive equilibrium. This approach provides a tractable and
theoretically sound methodology for modeling learning agents in economic
systems within the broader domain of computational social science.

<details>

Motivation: 解决大规模MIMO系统中深度学习模型训练需要高质量本地数据集的问题，同时优化能耗和用户速率需求。

Method: 使用Transformer基础模型，结合数据增强方法（通过预训练特征提取器的余弦相似度寻找目标分布样本）。

Result: 在相同能耗下，零样本部署性能显著优于零强迫方法，接近加权最小均方误差性能且复杂度降低8倍。

Conclusion: 该工作通过解决数据可用性和训练复杂度问题，实现了深度学习解决方案的实际应用，并支持动态配置用户速率需求以优化能效和公平性。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a solution for precoding in massive
multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems due to its capacity to learn the
characteristics of the propagation environment. However, training such a model
requires high-quality, local datasets at the deployment site, which are often
difficult to collect. We propose a transformer-based foundation model for mMIMO
precoding that seeks to minimize the energy consumption of the transmitter
while dynamically adapting to per-user rate requirements. At equal energy
consumption, zero-shot deployment of the proposed foundation model
significantly outperforms zero forcing, and approaches weighted minimum mean
squared error performance with 8x less complexity. To address model adaptation
in data-scarce settings, we introduce a data augmentation method that finds
training samples similar to the target distribution by computing the cosine
similarity between the outputs of the pre-trained feature extractor. Our work
enables the implementation of DL-based solutions in practice by addressing
challenges of data availability and training complexity. Moreover, the ability
to dynamically configure per-user rate requirements can be leveraged by higher
level resource allocation and scheduling algorithms for greater control over
energy efficiency, spectral efficiency and fairness.

Motivation: 手动探索LLM嵌入空间的拓扑结构以揭示其编码的语言特性需要大量人力，因此需要一种自动化方法来提高效率。

Method: 定义了一个可探索元素的分类法，并通过两种可定制的LLM代理（基于扰动技术）进行标注和分析。

Conclusion: 该框架为半自动探索LLM嵌入空间提供了一种高效方法，有助于理解其拓扑结构和语言特性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce high-dimensional embeddings that capture
rich semantic and syntactic relationships between words, sentences, and
concepts. Investigating the topological structures of LLM embedding spaces via
mapper graphs enables us to understand their underlying structures.
Specifically, a mapper graph summarizes the topological structure of the
embedding space, where each node represents a topological neighborhood
(containing a cluster of embeddings), and an edge connects two nodes if their
corresponding neighborhoods overlap. However, manually exploring these
embedding spaces to uncover encoded linguistic properties requires considerable
human effort. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework for
semi-automatic annotation of these embedding properties. To organize the
exploration process, we first define a taxonomy of explorable elements within a
mapper graph such as nodes, edges, paths, components, and trajectories. The
annotation of these elements is executed through two types of customizable
LLM-based agents that employ perturbation techniques for scalable and automated
analysis. These agents help to explore and explain the characteristics of
mapper elements and verify the robustness of the generated explanations. We
instantiate the framework within a visual analytics workspace and demonstrate
its effectiveness through case studies. In particular, we replicate findings
from prior research on BERT's embedding properties across various layers of its
architecture and provide further observations into the linguistic properties of
topological neighborhoods.

Abstract: The deployment of large-scale software-based 5G core functions presents
significant challenges due to their reliance on optimized and intelligent
resource provisioning for their services. Many studies have focused on
analyzing the impact of resource allocation for complex deployments using
mathematical models, queue theories, or even Artificial Intelligence (AI). This

registration performance. Our findings highlight the necessity of diverse
resource profiles to ensure Service-Level Agreement (SLA) compliance in
large-scale 5G core deployments. Additionally, our analysis of packet capture
approaches demonstrates the potential of kernel-based monitoring for scalable
security threat defense. Finally, our empirical evaluation provides insights

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视了视觉输入作为攻击面的潜力，导致对LVLMs中RCAs的防御不足。

Method: 提出Vision Guided Optimization和Multi-Objective Parallel Losses，生成对抗性扰动以实现无限制输出。

Result: RECALLED显著增加了服务响应延迟和资源消耗（GPU利用率提升20%）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LVLMs的安全漏洞，为未来防御RCAs提供了框架。

Abstract: Resource Consumption Attacks (RCAs) have emerged as a significant threat to
the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). With the integration of vision
modalities, additional attack vectors exacerbate the risk of RCAs in large
vision-language models (LVLMs). However, existing red-teaming studies have
largely overlooked visual inputs as a potential attack surface, resulting in
insufficient mitigation strategies against RCAs in LVLMs. To address this gap,
we propose RECALLED (\textbf{RE}source \textbf{C}onsumption \textbf{A}ttack on
\textbf{L}arge Vision-\textbf{L}anguag\textbf{E} Mo\textbf{D}els), the first
approach for exploiting visual modalities to trigger unbounded RCAs
red-teaming. First, we present \textit{Vision Guided Optimization}, a
fine-grained pixel-level optimization, to obtain \textit{Output Recall}
adversarial perturbations, which can induce repeating output. Then, we inject
the perturbations into visual inputs, triggering unbounded generations to
achieve the goal of RCAs. Additionally, we introduce \textit{Multi-Objective
Parallel Losses} to generate universal attack templates and resolve
optimization conflicts when intending to implement parallel attacks. Empirical
results demonstrate that RECALLED increases service response latency by over 26
$\uparrow$, resulting in an additional 20\% increase in GPU utilization and
memory consumption. Our study exposes security vulnerabilities in LVLMs and
establishes a red-teaming framework that can facilitate future defense
development against RCAs.

TL;DR: LoRA-Leak框架揭示了基于LoRA微调的语言模型仍易受成员推理攻击（MIA）的影响，并提出改进的防御措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究认为LoRA微调数据不易受MIA攻击，但忽略了预训练模型可能带来的信息泄露风险。

Method: 提出LoRA-Leak框架，整合15种MIA方法（包括5种改进方法），评估LoRA微调模型的隐私风险。

Result: 实验显示LoRA微调模型仍易受MIA攻击（如AUC达0.775），并发现仅dropout和排除特定层能有效防御。

Conclusion: 预训练模型的存在加剧了LoRA微调模型的MIA风险，需关注数据隐私保护。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) typically adhere to a "pre-training and fine-tuning"
paradigm, where a universal pre-trained model can be fine-tuned to cater to
various specialized domains. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained the most
widespread use in LM fine-tuning due to its lightweight computational cost and
remarkable performance. Because the proportion of parameters tuned by LoRA is
relatively small, there might be a misleading impression that the LoRA
fine-tuning data is invulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs).
However, we identify that utilizing the pre-trained model can induce more
information leakage, which is neglected by existing MIAs. Therefore, we
introduce LoRA-Leak, a holistic evaluation framework for MIAs against the
fine-tuning datasets of LMs. LoRA-Leak incorporates fifteen membership
inference attacks, including ten existing MIAs, and five improved MIAs that
leverage the pre-trained model as a reference. In experiments, we apply
LoRA-Leak to three advanced LMs across three popular natural language
processing tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs are still
vulnerable to MIAs (e.g., 0.775 AUC under conservative fine-tuning settings).
We also applied LoRA-Leak to different fine-tuning settings to understand the
resulting privacy risks. We further explore four defenses and find that only
dropout and excluding specific LM layers during fine-tuning effectively
mitigate MIA risks while maintaining utility. We highlight that under the
"pre-training and fine-tuning" paradigm, the existence of the pre-trained model
makes MIA a more severe risk for LoRA-based LMs. We hope that our findings can
provide guidance on data privacy protection for specialized LM providers.

Abstract: Information security is facing increasingly severe challenges, and
traditional protection means are difficult to cope with complex and changing
threats. In recent years, as an emerging intelligent technology, large language
models (LLMs) have shown a broad application prospect in the field of
information security. In this paper, we focus on the key role of LLM in
information security, systematically review its application progress in
malicious behavior prediction, network threat analysis, system vulnerability
detection, malicious code identification, and cryptographic algorithm
optimization, and explore its potential in enhancing security protection
performance. Based on neural networks and Transformer architecture, this paper
analyzes the technical basis of large language models and their advantages in
natural language processing tasks. It is shown that the introduction of large
language modeling helps to improve the detection accuracy and reduce the false
alarm rate of security systems. Finally, this paper summarizes the current
application results and points out that it still faces challenges in model
transparency, interpretability, and scene adaptability, among other issues. It
is necessary to explore further the optimization of the model structure and the
improvement of the generalization ability to realize a more intelligent and
accurate information security protection system.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种非侵入式的深度神经网络（DNN）水印服务（NWaaS）框架ShadowMark，解决了现有水印方法对模型参数或结构的侵入性问题，实现了绝对保真度并适用于多种DNN架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DNN水印方法因侵入性导致模型行为偏移和额外调优成本，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 提出NWaaS框架，通过黑盒API建立非侵入式侧信道，结合关键编码器和水印解码器实现水印提取。

Result: 实验证明ShadowMark在多种DNN模型中高效且实用，同时抵御现有攻击。

Conclusion: ShadowMark为非侵入式DNN水印提供了可行的解决方案，消除了保真度与鲁棒性之间的权衡。

Abstract: The intellectual property of deep neural network (DNN) models can be
protected with DNN watermarking, which embeds copyright watermarks into model
parameters (white-box), model behavior (black-box), or model outputs
(box-free), and the watermarks can be subsequently extracted to verify model
ownership or detect model theft. Despite recent advances, these existing
methods are inherently intrusive, as they either modify the model parameters or
alter the structure. This natural intrusiveness raises concerns about
watermarking-induced shifts in model behavior and the additional cost of
fine-tuning, further exacerbated by the rapidly growing model size. As a
result, model owners are often reluctant to adopt DNN watermarking in practice,
which limits the development of practical Watermarking as a Service (WaaS)
systems. To address this issue, we introduce Nonintrusive Watermarking as a
Service (NWaaS), a novel trustless paradigm designed for X-to-Image models, in
which we hypothesize that with the model untouched, an owner-defined watermark
can still be extracted from model outputs. Building on this concept, we propose
ShadowMark, a concrete implementation of NWaaS which addresses critical
deployment challenges by establishing a robust and nonintrusive side channel in
the protected model's black-box API, leveraging a key encoder and a watermark
decoder. It is significantly distinctive from existing solutions by attaining
the so-called absolute fidelity and being applicable to different DNN
architectures, while being also robust against existing attacks, eliminating
the fidelity-robustness trade-off. Extensive experiments on image-to-image,
noise-to-image, noise-and-text-to-image, and text-to-image models, demonstrate
the efficacy and practicality of ShadowMark for real-world deployment of
nonintrusive DNN watermarking.

challenge in various educational domains. Novices often struggle with cognitive
biases such as premature closure and over-reliance on heuristics.
Scenario-based learning (SBL) can address these challenges by offering
realistic case experiences and iterative practice, but the optimal sequencing
of instruction and problem-solving activities remains unclear. This study
examines how personalized support can be incorporated into different
instructional sequences and whether providing explicit diagnostic strategy
instruction before (I-PS) or after problem-solving (PS-I) improves learning and
its transfer. We employ a between-groups design in an online SBL environment
called PharmaSim, which simulates real-world client interactions for pharmacy
technician apprentices. Results indicate that while both instruction types are
beneficial, PS-I leads to significantly higher performance in transfer tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段微调方法，用于解决自动驾驶技术在不同环境和系统中的可扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶的广泛部署需要适应不同车辆、环境和法规，但现有研究多局限于特定场景，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 采用两阶段微调：第一阶段通过国家特定奖励模型适应环境；第二阶段通过车辆特定迁移学习实现系统适配。

Result: 该方法整合了技术和社会政治因素，实现了跨技术、法律、文化和伦理差异的有效扩展。

Conclusion: 提出的数据驱动过程为自动驾驶的可扩展性提供了灵活且全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient scalability of automated driving (AD) is key to reducing costs,
enhancing safety, conserving resources, and maximizing impact. However,
research focuses on specific vehicles and context, while broad deployment
requires scalability across various configurations and environments.
Differences in vehicle types, sensors, actuators, but also traffic regulations,
legal requirements, cultural dynamics, or even ethical paradigms demand high
flexibility of data-driven developed capabilities. In this paper, we address
the challenge of scalable adaptation of generic capabilities to desired systems
and environments. Our concept follows a two-stage fine-tuning process. In the
first stage, fine-tuning to the specific environment takes place through a
country-specific reward model that serves as an interface between technological
adaptations and socio-political requirements. In the second stage,
vehicle-specific transfer learning facilitates system adaptation and governs
the validation of design decisions. In sum, our concept offers a data-driven
process that integrates both technological and socio-political aspects,
enabling effective scalability across technical, legal, cultural, and ethical
differences.

TL;DR: 本文综述了金融基础模型（FFMs）的分类、架构、训练方法、应用及未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用基础模型（如GPT-4）在金融领域表现良好，但受限于领域特定需求（如多模态推理、合规性等），因此需要专门设计的金融基础模型（FFMs）。

Method: 通过分类三种关键模态（FinLFMs、FinTSFMs、FinVLFMs），综述其架构、训练方法、数据集和应用。

Result: 总结了FFMs的现状，并指出数据可用性、算法可扩展性和基础设施限制等挑战。

Conclusion: 本文旨在为FFMs的研究提供全面参考，并推动未来创新。

Abstract: The advent of foundation models (FMs) - large-scale pre-trained models with
strong generalization capabilities - has opened new frontiers for financial
engineering. While general-purpose FMs such as GPT-4 and Gemini have
demonstrated promising performance in tasks ranging from financial report
summarization to sentiment-aware forecasting, many financial applications
remain constrained by unique domain requirements such as multimodal reasoning,
regulatory compliance, and data privacy. These challenges have spurred the
emergence of Financial Foundation Models (FFMs) - a new class of models
explicitly designed for finance. This survey presents a comprehensive overview
of FFMs, with a taxonomy spanning three key modalities: Financial Language
Foundation Models (FinLFMs), Financial Time-Series Foundation Models
(FinTSFMs), and Financial Visual-Language Foundation Models (FinVLFMs). We
review their architectures, training methodologies, datasets, and real-world
applications. Furthermore, we identify critical challenges in data
availability, algorithmic scalability, and infrastructure constraints, and
offer insights into future research opportunities. We hope this survey serves
as both a comprehensive reference for understanding FFMs and a practical
roadmap for future innovation. An updated collection of FFM-related
publications and resources will be maintained on our website

TL;DR: VERIRAG框架通过引入科学质量评估方法，显著提升了检索增强生成系统在临床决策中的可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有检索增强生成系统无法评估科学证据质量的盲点，确保临床决策基于高质量证据。

Method: 提出VERIRAG框架，包括11点检查清单（Veritable）、Hard-to-Vary评分和动态接受阈值。

Result: 在四个数据集上，VERIRAG的F1分数为0.53至0.65，比次优方法提升10至14点。

Conclusion: VERIRAG通过科学质量评估显著提升系统性能，为临床决策提供更可靠支持。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are increasingly adopted in
clinical decision support, yet they remain methodologically blind-they retrieve
evidence but cannot vet its scientific quality. A paper claiming "Antioxidant
proteins decreased after alloferon treatment" and a rigorous multi-laboratory
replication study will be treated as equally credible, even if the former
lacked scientific rigor or was even retracted. To address this challenge, we
introduce VERIRAG, a framework that makes three notable contributions: (i) the
Veritable, an 11-point checklist that evaluates each source for methodological
rigor, including data integrity and statistical validity; (ii) a Hard-to-Vary
(HV) Score, a quantitative aggregator that weights evidence by its quality and
diversity; and (iii) a Dynamic Acceptance Threshold, which calibrates the
required evidence based on how extraordinary a claim is. Across four
datasets-comprising retracted, conflicting, comprehensive, and settled science
corpora-the VERIRAG approach consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving
absolute F1 scores ranging from 0.53 to 0.65, representing a 10 to 14 point
improvement over the next-best method in each respective dataset. We will
release all materials necessary for reproducing our results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律案例检索（PCR）因文本长度限制和数据隐私问题，传统深度学习方法效果不佳，需探索新方法。

Method: 采用LLM-based文本嵌入方法，支持更长输入且无需训练数据，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Result: 在四个PCR基准数据集上，LLM-based方法优于BM25和监督式Transformer模型。

Conclusion: LLM-based文本嵌入方法在法律案例检索中具有显著优势，解决了传统方法的挑战。

Abstract: In common law systems, legal professionals such as lawyers and judges rely on
precedents to build their arguments. As the volume of cases has grown massively
over time, effectively retrieving prior cases has become essential. Prior case
retrieval (PCR) is an information retrieval (IR) task that aims to
automatically identify the most relevant court cases for a specific query from
a large pool of potential candidates. While IR methods have seen several
paradigm shifts over the last few years, the vast majority of PCR methods
continue to rely on traditional IR methods, such as BM25. The state-of-the-art
deep learning IR methods have not been successful in PCR due to two key
challenges: i. Lengthy legal text limitation; when using the powerful
BERT-based transformer models, there is a limit of input text lengths, which
inevitably requires to shorten the input via truncation or division with a loss
of legal context information. ii. Lack of legal training data; due to data
privacy concerns, available PCR datasets are often limited in size, making it
difficult to train deep learning-based models effectively. In this research, we
address these challenges by leveraging LLM-based text embedders in PCR.
LLM-based embedders support longer input lengths, and since we use them in an
unsupervised manner, they do not require training data, addressing both
challenges simultaneously. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art
LLM-based text embedders in four PCR benchmark datasets and show that they
outperform BM25 and supervised transformer-based models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DR.EHR的密集检索模型，专门针对电子健康记录（EHR）检索问题，通过两阶段训练流程显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录（EHR）检索存在语义鸿沟问题，现有模型因缺乏医学知识或训练数据不匹配而表现不佳。

Method: 采用两阶段训练流程：第一阶段从生物医学知识图谱中提取医学实体并注入知识；第二阶段利用大语言模型生成多样化训练数据。训练了110M和7B参数的模型变体。

Result: 在CliniQ基准测试中，DR.EHR显著优于现有密集检索模型，达到最先进水平，尤其在语义匹配任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: DR.EHR为EHR检索提供了强大解决方案，并通过实验验证了其通用性和各组件有效性。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are pivotal in clinical practices, yet their
retrieval remains a challenge mainly due to semantic gap issues. Recent
advancements in dense retrieval offer promising solutions but existing models,
both general-domain and biomedical-domain, fall short due to insufficient
medical knowledge or mismatched training corpora. This paper introduces
\texttt{DR.EHR}, a series of dense retrieval models specifically tailored for
EHR retrieval. We propose a two-stage training pipeline utilizing MIMIC-IV
discharge summaries to address the need for extensive medical knowledge and
large-scale training data. The first stage involves medical entity extraction
and knowledge injection from a biomedical knowledge graph, while the second
stage employs large language models to generate diverse training data. We train
two variants of \texttt{DR.EHR}, with 110M and 7B parameters, respectively.
Evaluated on the CliniQ benchmark, our models significantly outperforms all
existing dense retrievers, achieving state-of-the-art results. Detailed
analyses confirm our models' superiority across various match and query types,
particularly in challenging semantic matches like implication and abbreviation.
Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each pipeline component, and
supplementary experiments on EHR QA datasets demonstrate the models'
generalizability on natural language questions, including complex ones with
multiple entities. This work significantly advances EHR retrieval, offering a
robust solution for clinical applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的数据集Fashion-AlterEval和两种元用户模拟器，用于改进对话推荐系统的评估，解决了现有模拟器仅关注单一目标物品和无限耐心的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话推荐系统（CRS）的模拟器在离线评估中存在局限性，如仅关注单一目标物品和无限耐心，无法真实反映用户行为。

Method: 提出Fashion-AlterEval数据集，包含人类对替代物品的评判；设计两种元用户模拟器，允许模拟用户表达对替代物品的偏好并改变耐心水平。

Result: 实验表明，使用替代物品知识的模拟器显著影响CRS模型评估，现有单一目标评估低估了系统效果，而考虑替代物品能更快满足用户需求。

Conclusion: 新数据集和模拟器改进了CRS评估，揭示了现有方法的不足，并展示了替代物品知识的重要性。

Abstract: In Conversational Recommendation Systems (CRS), a user provides feedback on
recommended items at each turn, leading the CRS towards improved
recommendations. Due to the need for a large amount of data, a user simulator
is employed for both training and evaluation. Such user simulators critique the
current retrieved item based on knowledge of a single target item. However,
system evaluation in offline settings with simulators is limited by the focus
on a single target item and their unlimited patience over a large number of
turns. To overcome these limitations of existing simulators, we propose
Fashion-AlterEval, a new dataset that contains human judgments for a selection
of alternative items by adding new annotations in common fashion CRS datasets.
Consequently, we propose two novel meta-user simulators that use the collected
judgments and allow simulated users not only to express their preferences about
alternative items to their original target, but also to change their mind and
level of patience. In our experiments using the Shoes and Fashion IQ as the
original datasets and three CRS models, we find that using the knowledge of
alternatives by the simulator can have a considerable impact on the evaluation
of existing CRS models, specifically that the existing single-target evaluation
underestimates their effectiveness, and when simulatedusers are allowed to
instead consider alternative relevant items, the system can rapidly respond to
more quickly satisfy the user.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要针对每个实例进行微调，限制了可扩展性，因此需要一种零样本方法。

Method: 利用结构化2x2视频网格训练轻量级Grid-LoRA适配器，并通过Grid Fill模块完成部分观察的布局。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在未见过的动态概念和编辑场景中均能生成高质量且一致的结果。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在零样本设置下有效，为动态概念个性化提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have enabled high-quality
synthesis from text and image prompts. While the personalization of dynamic
concepts, which capture subject-specific appearance and motion from a single
video, is now feasible, most existing methods require per-instance fine-tuning,
limiting scalability. We introduce a fully zero-shot framework for dynamic
concept personalization in text-to-video models. Our method leverages
structured 2x2 video grids that spatially organize input and output pairs,
enabling the training of lightweight Grid-LoRA adapters for editing and
composition within these grids. At inference, a dedicated Grid Fill module
completes partially observed layouts, producing temporally coherent and
identity preserving outputs. Once trained, the entire system operates in a
single forward pass, generalizing to previously unseen dynamic concepts without
any test-time optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate high-quality and
consistent results across a wide range of subjects beyond trained concepts and
editing scenarios.

Motivation: 现有方法在3D头部虚拟化身生成中难以平衡身份保持（重建）与新姿势和表情（动画），导致质量不佳。

Method: GeoAvatar采用自适应预分配阶段（APS）分割高斯，引入嘴部结构和部分变形策略，并提出正则化损失以精确绑定高斯与3DMM面部。

Result: 实验表明，GeoAvatar在重建和新动画场景中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GeoAvatar通过自适应几何高斯泼溅和嘴部优化，显著提升了3D头部虚拟化身的生成质量。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D head avatar generation, balancing identity
preservation, i.e., reconstruction, with novel poses and expressions, i.e.,
animation, remains a challenge. Existing methods struggle to adapt Gaussians to
varying geometrical deviations across facial regions, resulting in suboptimal
quality. To address this, we propose GeoAvatar, a framework for adaptive
geometrical Gaussian Splatting. GeoAvatar leverages Adaptive Pre-allocation
Stage (APS), an unsupervised method that segments Gaussians into rigid and
flexible sets for adaptive offset regularization. Then, based on mouth anatomy
and dynamics, we introduce a novel mouth structure and the part-wise
deformation strategy to enhance the animation fidelity of the mouth. Finally,
we propose a regularization loss for precise rigging between Gaussians and 3DMM
faces. Moreover, we release DynamicFace, a video dataset with highly expressive
facial motions. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GeoAvatar
compared to state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and novel animation
scenarios.

Result: 模型内存占用降至3.4 MB，所需未来音频上下文减少至81 ms，同时保持高质量动画。

Conclusion: 该方法为设备端实时推理提供了可行方案，推动了模型驱动的数字角色发展。

Abstract: The training of high-quality, robust machine learning models for
speech-driven 3D facial animation requires a large, diverse dataset of
high-quality audio-animation pairs. To overcome the lack of such a dataset,
recent work has introduced large pre-trained speech encoders that are robust to
variations in the input audio and, therefore, enable the facial animation model
to generalize across speakers, audio quality, and languages. However, the
resulting facial animation models are prohibitively large and lend themselves
only to offline inference on a dedicated machine. In this work, we explore
on-device, real-time facial animation models in the context of game
development. We overcome the lack of large datasets by using hybrid knowledge
distillation with pseudo-labeling. Given a large audio dataset, we employ a
high-performing teacher model to train very small student models. In contrast
to the pre-trained speech encoders, our student models only consist of
convolutional and fully-connected layers, removing the need for attention
context or recurrent updates. In our experiments, we demonstrate that we can
reduce the memory footprint to up to 3.4 MB and required future audio context
to up to 81 ms while maintaining high-quality animations. This paves the way
for on-device inference, an important step towards realistic, model-driven
digital characters.

Motivation: 传统逆向渲染方法依赖固定环境光照，导致3D重建精度不足。MVPS虽能提高精度，但效率低下。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 首先构建2D高斯溅射模型作为初始几何，随后通过包含光照计算的多层感知机进行逆向渲染，并利用未校准光度立体法估计的法线进行正则化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在合成和真实数据集上均优于现有方法，重建精度和计算效率更高。

Conclusion: PS-GS方法有效解决了逆向渲染的难题，适用于新视角合成、重光照及材质形状编辑。

Abstract: Integrating inverse rendering with multi-view photometric stereo (MVPS)
yields more accurate 3D reconstructions than the inverse rendering approaches
that rely on fixed environment illumination. However, efficient inverse
rendering with MVPS remains challenging. To fill this gap, we introduce the
Gaussian Splatting for Multi-view Photometric Stereo (PS-GS), which efficiently
and jointly estimates the geometry, materials, and lighting of the object that
is illuminated by diverse directional lights (multi-light). Our method first
reconstructs a standard 2D Gaussian splatting model as the initial geometry.
Based on the initialization model, it then proceeds with the deferred inverse
rendering by the full rendering equation containing a lighting-computing
multi-layer perceptron. During the whole optimization, we regularize the
rendered normal maps by the uncalibrated photometric stereo estimated normals.
We also propose the 2D Gaussian ray-tracing for single directional light to
refine the incident lighting. The regularizations and the use of multi-view and
multi-light images mitigate the ill-posed problem of inverse rendering. After
optimization, the reconstructed object can be used for novel-view synthesis,
relighting, and material and shape editing. Experiments on both synthetic and
real datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms prior works in terms of
reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Method: 研究通过集成RGA模块和数据管道到现有DT框架中，管理现实差距，实现双向知识转移。

Result: 案例研究表明，完全集成的RGA模块和数据管道能够在不影响效率的情况下实现双向知识转移。

Conclusion: RGA模块的集成是解决数字孪生知识转移问题的有效方法，为标准化框架提供了重要支持。

Abstract: The advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence
has catalyzed the evolution of Digital Twins (DTs) from conceptual ideas to
more implementable realities. Yet, transitioning from academia to industry is
complex due to the absence of standardized frameworks. This paper builds upon
the authors' previously established functional and informational requirements
supporting standardized DT development, focusing on a crucial aspect:
transferability. While existing DT research primarily centers on asset
transfer, the significance of "sim-to-real transfer" and "real-to-sim
transfer"--transferring knowledge between simulations and real-world
operations--is vital for comprehensive lifecycle management in DTs. A key
challenge in this process is calibrating the "reality gap," the discrepancy
between simulated predictions and actual outcomes. Our research investigates
the impact of integrating a single Reality Gap Analysis (RGA) module into an
existing DT framework to effectively manage both sim-to-real and real-to-sim
transfers. This integration is facilitated by data pipelines that connect the
RGA module with the existing components of the DT framework, including the
historical repository and the simulation model. A case study on a pedestrian
bridge at Carnegie Mellon University showcases the performance of different
levels of integration of our approach with an existing framework. With full
implementation of an RGA module and a complete data pipeline, our approach is
capable of bidirectional knowledge transfer between simulations and real-world
operations without compromising efficiency.

Result: 在七比特的图态制备任务中，算法能发现最小深度电路，且适用于通用门集。

Conclusion: 该强化学习方法能高效探索复杂量子状态空间，合成近似最优电路，为量子电路优化提供资源高效的基础。

Abstract: A reinforcement learning (RL) framework is introduced for the efficient
synthesis of quantum circuits that generate specified target quantum states
from a fixed initial state, addressing a central challenge in both the NISQ era
and future fault-tolerant quantum computing. The approach utilizes tabular
Q-learning, based on action sequences, within a discretized quantum state
space, to effectively manage the exponential growth of the space dimension. The
framework introduces a hybrid reward mechanism, combining a static,
domain-informed reward that guides the agent toward the target state with
customizable dynamic penalties that discourage inefficient circuit structures
such as gate congestion and redundant state revisits. By leveraging sparse
matrix representations and state-space discretization, the method enables
scalable navigation of high-dimensional environments while minimizing
computational overhead. Benchmarking on graph-state preparation tasks for up to
seven qubits, we demonstrate that the algorithm consistently discovers
minimal-depth circuits with optimized gate counts. Moreover, extending the
framework to a universal gate set for arbitrary quantum states, it still
produces minimal depth circuits, highlighting the algorithm's robustness and
adaptability. The results confirm that this RL-driven approach efficiently
explores the complex quantum state space and synthesizes near-optimal quantum
circuits, providing a resource-efficient foundation for quantum circuit
optimization.

Conclusion: 量子计算能显著提升部分可观测环境中的决策效率，但优势程度因部署环境而异。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a principled framework for
decision-making in partially observable environments, which can be modeled as
Markov decision processes and compactly represented through dynamic decision
Bayesian networks. Recent advances demonstrate that inference on sparse
Bayesian networks can be accelerated using quantum rejection sampling combined
with amplitude amplification, leading to a computational speedup in estimating
acceptance probabilities.\\ Building on this result, we introduce Quantum
Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (QBRL), a hybrid quantum-classical look-ahead
algorithm for model-based RL in partially observable environments. We present a
rigorous, oracle-free time complexity analysis under fault-tolerant assumptions
for the quantum device. Unlike standard treatments that assume a black-box
oracle, we explicitly specify the inference process, allowing our bounds to
more accurately reflect the true computational cost. We show that, for
environments whose dynamics form a sparse Bayesian network, horizon-based
near-optimal planning can be achieved sub-quadratically faster through
quantum-enhanced belief updates.
  Furthermore, we present numerical experiments benchmarking QBRL against its
classical counterpart on simple yet illustrative decision-making tasks. Our
results offer a detailed analysis of how the quantum computational advantage
translates into decision-making performance, highlighting that the magnitude of
the advantage can vary significantly across different deployment settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的非凸优化框架，用于设计无限时域线性二次（LQ）问题中的组稀疏反馈控制器，解决了分布式LQ问题和稀疏反馈LQ问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模系统需要可扩展和结构感知的控制，现有方法依赖凸松弛或仅限于块对角结构，无法直接处理一般稀疏模式。

Method: 将控制器设计直接表述为带有组ℓ0范数正则化的有限维非凸优化问题，并提出基于惩罚的近端交替线性化最小化（PALM）算法。

Result: 建立了DFT-LQ和SF-LQ问题的联系，证明了算法在温和假设下的全局收敛性，填补了直接设计组稀疏反馈增益的理论空白。

Conclusion: 该方法无需依赖凸替代或限制性结构假设，为组稀疏反馈增益的直接设计提供了理论保证。

Abstract: This paper develops a unified nonconvex optimization framework for the design
of group-sparse feedback controllers in infinite-horizon linear-quadratic (LQ)
problems. We address two prominent extensions of the classical LQ problem: the
distributed LQ problem with fixed communication topology (DFT-LQ) and the
sparse feedback LQ problem (SF-LQ), both of which are motivated by the need for
scalable and structure-aware control in large-scale systems. Unlike existing
approaches that rely on convex relaxations or are limited to block-diagonal
structures, we directly formulate the controller synthesis as a
finite-dimensional nonconvex optimization problem with group $\ell_0$-norm
regularization, capturing general sparsity patterns. We establish a connection
between DFT-LQ and SF-LQ problems, showing that both can be addressed within
our unified framework. Furthermore, we propose a penalty-based proximal
alternating linearized minimization (PALM) algorithm and provide a rigorous
convergence analysis under mild assumptions, overcoming the lack of coercivity
in the objective function. The proposed method admits efficient solvers for all
subproblems and guarantees global convergence to critical points. Our results
fill a key gap in the literature by enabling the direct design of group-sparse
feedback gains with theoretical guarantees, without resorting to convex
surrogates or restrictive structural assumptions.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了四种LLM代理通信策略在数学问题解决中的效果，发现双代理优于单代理，其中“同伴协作”表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估不同通信策略对LLM代理协作问题解决的影响，以优化AI教育应用。

Method: 在OpenAI GPT-4o模型中，使用MATH数据集测试四种通信模式（师生互动、同伴协作、互惠同伴教学、批判性辩论）。

Result: 双代理设置优于单代理，同伴协作模式准确率最高；对话行为（如陈述、确认、提示）对协作至关重要。

Conclusion: 多代理框架提升计算任务效率，但有效通信策略是解决AI教育复杂问题的关键。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly utilized in AI-aided
education to support tutoring and learning. Effective communication strategies
among LLM agents improve collaborative problem-solving efficiency and
facilitate cost-effective adoption in education. However, little research has
systematically evaluated the impact of different communication strategies on
agents' problem-solving. Our study examines four communication modes,
\textit{teacher-student interaction}, \textit{peer-to-peer collaboration},
\textit{reciprocal peer teaching}, and \textit{critical debate}, in a
dual-agent, chat-based mathematical problem-solving environment using the
OpenAI GPT-4o model. Evaluated on the MATH dataset, our results show that
dual-agent setups outperform single agents, with \textit{peer-to-peer
collaboration} achieving the highest accuracy. Dialogue acts like statements,
acknowledgment, and hints play a key role in collaborative problem-solving.
While multi-agent frameworks enhance computational tasks, effective
communication strategies are essential for tackling complex problems in AI
education.

Method: 结合Whisper转录和GPT-4o模块化学习管道，自动生成SOAP记录和患者指导，并通过BART模型优化简洁性。

Result: 生成的记录质量优于专家手写记录，540名临床医生使用后反馈认知负担和文档压力显著降低。

Conclusion: AI系统在减轻行政负担和支持高效高质量医疗服务方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Clinician burnout has motivated the growing adoption of ambient medical
scribes in the clinic. In this work, we introduce a custom-built ambient scribe
application integrated into the EHR system at Included Health, a personalized
all-in-one healthcare company offering telehealth services. The application
uses Whisper for transcription and a modular in-context learning pipeline with
GPT-4o to automatically generate SOAP notes and patient instructions. Testing
on mock visit data shows that the notes generated by the application exceed the
quality of expert-written notes as determined by an LLM-as-a-judge. The
application has been widely adopted by the clinical practice, with over 540
clinicians at Included Health using the application at least once. 94% (n = 63)
of surveyed clinicians report reduced cognitive load during visits and 97% (n =
66) report less documentation burden when using the application. Additionally,
we show that post-processing notes with a fine-tuned BART model improves
conciseness. These findings highlight the potential for AI systems to ease
administrative burdens and support clinicians in delivering efficient,
high-quality care.

integration into early-stage design processes demands a rethinking of
traditional workflows in human-centered design. This paper explores the
emergent paradigm of human-AI co-creation, where AI is not merely used for
automation or efficiency gains, but actively participates in ideation, visual
conceptualization, and decision-making. Specifically, we investigate the use of
large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and multimodal diffusion models such as
Stable Diffusion as creative agents that engage designers in iterative cycles
of proposal, critique, and revision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决海报设计中获取多样化观众反馈并达成共识的挑战。

Method: 构建基于营销文档的角色代理，收集反馈并通过讨论达成一致意见。

Result: 用户研究显示PosterMate能捕捉被忽视的观点，在线评估验证角色代理反馈的合理性。

Conclusion: PosterMate作为原型工具，有效整合多样化反馈，提升设计质量。

Abstract: Poster designing can benefit from synchronous feedback from target audiences.
However, gathering audiences with diverse perspectives and reconciling them on
design edits can be challenging. Recent generative AI models present
opportunities to simulate human-like interactions, but it is unclear how they
may be used for feedback processes in design. We introduce PosterMate, a poster
design assistant that facilitates collaboration by creating audience-driven
persona agents constructed from marketing documents. PosterMate gathers
feedback from each persona agent regarding poster components, and stimulates
discussion with the help of a moderator to reach a conclusion. These
agreed-upon edits can then be directly integrated into the poster design.
Through our user study (N=12), we identified the potential of PosterMate to
capture overlooked viewpoints, while serving as an effective prototyping tool.
Additionally, our controlled online evaluation (N=100) revealed that the
feedback from an individual persona agent is appropriate given its persona
identity, and the discussion effectively synthesizes the different persona
agents' perspectives.

Motivation: 研究教师如何实际使用AI工具及其互动模式，填补大规模研究的空白。

Method: 采用四阶段编码流程（主题发现、代码本开发、结构化标注和模型基准测试），结合定性分析与LLMs性能评估。

Result: LLMs在主题识别和复杂场景中表现优异，教师主要利用AI优化教学（79.7%）、内容创作（76.1%）和学生支持（43.3%）。

Conclusion: 研究为AI辅助教育研究提供了可扩展模型，揭示了生成式AI在教育中的新兴角色。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into educational tools has
the potential to substantially impact how teachers plan instruction, support
diverse learners, and engage in professional reflection. Yet little is known
about how educators actually use these tools in practice and how their
interactions with AI can be meaningfully studied at scale. This paper presents
a human-AI collaborative methodology for large-scale qualitative analysis of
over 140,000 educator-AI messages drawn from a generative AI platform used by
K-12 teachers. Through a four-phase coding pipeline, we combined inductive
theme discovery, codebook development, structured annotation, and model
benchmarking to examine patterns of educator engagement and evaluate the
performance of LLMs in qualitative coding tasks. We developed a hierarchical
codebook aligned with established teacher evaluation frameworks, capturing
educators' instructional goals, contextual needs, and pedagogical strategies.
Our findings demonstrate that LLMs, particularly Claude 3.5 Haiku, can reliably
support theme identification, extend human recognition in complex scenarios,
and outperform open-weight models in both accuracy and structural reliability.
The analysis also reveals substantive patterns in how educators inquire AI to
enhance instructional practices (79.7 percent of total conversations), create
or adapt content (76.1 percent), support assessment and feedback loop (46.9
percent), attend to student needs for tailored instruction (43.3 percent), and
assist other professional responsibilities (34.2 percent), highlighting
emerging AI-related competencies that have direct implications for teacher
preparation and professional development. This study offers a scalable,
transparent model for AI-augmented qualitative research and provides
foundational insights into the evolving role of generative AI in educational
practice.

Abstract: Background: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) has seen a rapid evolution in management
technology and forms a useful case study for the future management of other
chronic conditions. Further development of this management technology requires
an exploration of its real-world use and the potential of additional data
streams. To facilitate this, we contribute the BrisT1D Dataset to the growing
number of public T1D management datasets. The dataset was developed from a
longitudinal study of 24 young adults in the UK who used a smartwatch alongside
their usual T1D management. Findings: The BrisT1D dataset features both device
data from the T1D management systems and smartwatches used by participants, as
well as transcripts of monthly interviews and focus groups conducted during the
study. The device data is provided in a processed state, for usability and more
rapid analysis, and in a raw state, for in-depth exploration of novel insights
captured in the study. Conclusions: This dataset has a range of potential
applications. The quantitative elements can support blood glucose prediction,
hypoglycaemia prediction, and closed-loop algorithm development. The
qualitative elements enable the exploration of user experiences and opinions,
as well as broader mixed-methods research into the role of smartwatches in T1D
management.

Conclusion: 该方法为认知建模提供了可扩展且可解释的解决方案，适用于自适应学习、人机交互和教育分析等领域。

Abstract: Eye-tracking data reveals valuable insights into users' cognitive states but
is difficult to analyze due to its structured, non-linguistic nature. While
large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning over text, they struggle with
temporal and numerical data. This paper presents a multimodal human-AI
collaborative framework designed to enhance cognitive pattern extraction from
eye-tracking signals. The framework includes: (1) a multi-stage pipeline using
horizontal and vertical segmentation alongside LLM reasoning to uncover latent
gaze patterns; (2) an Expert-Model Co-Scoring Module that integrates expert
judgment with LLM output to generate trust scores for behavioral
interpretations; and (3) a hybrid anomaly detection module combining LSTM-based
temporal modeling with LLM-driven semantic analysis. Our results across several
LLMs and prompt strategies show improvements in consistency, interpretability,
and performance, with up to 50% accuracy in difficulty prediction tasks. This
approach offers a scalable, interpretable solution for cognitive modeling and
has broad potential in adaptive learning, human-computer interaction, and
educational analytics.

Result: 实验结果表明，所提方法在LDPC码和BSC信道下显著提升了解码性能。

Conclusion: 强化学习方法有效降低了复杂度并提升了线性分组码的解码性能。

Abstract: This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning techniques to
enhance the performance of decoding of linear block codes based on flipping
bits and finding optimal decisions. We describe the methodology for mapping the
iterative decoding process into Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and propose
different methods to reduce the number of states in the MDP. A truncated MDP is
proposed to reduce the number of states in the MDP by learning a Hamming ball
with a specified radius around codewords. We then propose a general scheme for
reinforcement learning based decoders applicable to any class of codes to
improve the performance of decoders. We call this scheme an action-list
decoding. We design an action-list decoder based on the Deep-Q network values
that substantially enhance performance. We also get benefit of automorphism
group of code to further improve the code performance. Additionally, we propose
a feedback-based method to exploit and enhance the performance of existing
high-performing decoders by applying reinforcement learning algorithms after
the existing decoders. These approaches effectively reduces the complexity of
the reinforcement learning block. Finally, we present experimental results for
the Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes over the Binary Symmetric Channel
(BSC) to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.

Result: 在高斯和二元场景下获得理论最优解，并作为基准验证所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在隐私保护和数据重构之间实现了平衡，适用于需要协作才能准确恢复数据的场景。

Abstract: We study a privacy-preserving data-sharing setting where a privatizer
transforms private data into a sanitized version observed by an authorized
reconstructor and two unauthorized adversaries, each with access to side
information correlated with the private data.
  The reconstructor is evaluated under a distortion function, while each
adversary is evaluated using a separate loss function. The privatizer ensures
the reconstructor distortion remains below a fixed threshold while maximizing
the minimum loss across the two adversaries. This two-adversary setting models
cases where individual users cannot reconstruct the data accurately, but their
combined side information enables estimation within the distortion threshold.
The privatizer maximizes individual loss while permitting accurate
reconstruction only through collaboration. This echoes secret-sharing
principles, but with lossy rather than perfect recovery. We frame this as a
constrained data-driven minimax optimization problem and propose a data-driven
training procedure that alternately updates the privatizer, reconstructor, and
adversaries. We also analyze the Gaussian and binary cases as special scenarios
where optimal solutions can be obtained. These theoretical optimal results are
benchmarks for evaluating the proposed minimax training approach.

Result: 提出了五模块LCM架构、KPI驱动监控机制和跨供应商协作方案，但仍存在资源高效监控等挑战。

Conclusion: 这些发展为6G的AI原生收发器奠定了基础。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models are rapidly
permeating the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN), powering beam management, channel
state information (CSI) feedback, positioning, and mobility prediction.
However, without a standardized life-cycle management (LCM) framework,
challenges, such as model drift, vendor lock-in, and limited transparency,
hinder large-scale adoption. 3GPP Releases 16-20 progressively evolve AI/ML
from experimental features to managed, interoperable network functions.
Beginning with the Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) in Rel-16,
subsequent releases introduced standardized interfaces for model transfer,
execution, performance monitoring, and closed-loop control, culminating in
Rel-20's two-sided CSI-compression Work Item and vendor-agnostic LCM profile.
This article reviews the resulting five-block LCM architecture, KPI-driven
monitoring mechanisms, and inter-vendor collaboration schemes, while
identifying open challenges in resource-efficient monitoring, environment drift
detection, intelligent decision-making, and flexible model training. These
developments lay the foundation for AI-native transceivers as a key enabler for
6G.

Motivation: 尽管预训练大语言模型（LLMs）在常识推理方面表现出色，但在开放世界中将语言描述转化为实际机器人动作仍具挑战性。

Method: 利用MLLMs的跨模态理解和代码生成能力，结合视觉语言感知模型生成2D鸟瞰图价值地图，整合语义与空间信息。

Result: 在户外导航任务中验证了零样本视觉语言导航框架的可行性，并在Husky机器人上展示了其在实际场景中的鲁棒性和适用性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将语言指令转化为机器人动作，展示了在开放世界导航任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
common-sense reasoning abilities, making them promising for robotic navigation
and planning tasks. However, despite recent progress, bridging the gap between
language descriptions and actual robot actions in the open-world, beyond merely
invoking limited predefined motion primitives, remains an open challenge. In
this work, we aim to enable robots to interpret and decompose complex language
instructions, ultimately synthesizing a sequence of trajectory points to
complete diverse navigation tasks given open-set instructions and open-set
objects. We observe that multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit
strong cross-modal understanding when processing free-form language
instructions, demonstrating robust scene comprehension. More importantly,
leveraging their code-generation capability, MLLMs can interact with
vision-language perception models to generate compositional 2D bird-eye-view
value maps, effectively integrating semantic knowledge from MLLMs with spatial
information from maps to reinforce the robot's spatial understanding. To
further validate our approach, we effectively leverage large-scale autonomous
vehicle datasets (AVDs) to validate our proposed zero-shot vision-language
navigation framework in outdoor navigation tasks, demonstrating its capability
to execute a diverse range of free-form natural language navigation
instructions while maintaining robustness against object detection errors and
linguistic ambiguities. Furthermore, we validate our system on a Husky robot in
both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating its real-world robustness and
applicability. Supplementary videos are available at

Result: 实验显示，MoRPI-PINN的导航精度比其他方法提高85%以上。

Conclusion: MoRPI-PINN是一种轻量级方法，适用于边缘设备，可广泛应用于移动机器人导航。

Abstract: A fundamental requirement for full autonomy in mobile robots is accurate
navigation even in situations where satellite navigation or cameras are
unavailable. In such practical situations, relying only on inertial sensors
will result in navigation solution drift due to the sensors' inherent noise and
error terms. One of the emerging solutions to mitigate drift is to maneuver the
robot in a snake-like slithering motion to increase the inertial
signal-to-noise ratio, allowing the regression of the mobile robot position. In
this work, we propose MoRPI-PINN as a physics-informed neural network framework
for accurate inertial-based mobile robot navigation. By embedding physical laws
and constraints into the training process, MoRPI-PINN is capable of providing
an accurate and robust navigation solution. Using real-world experiments, we
show accuracy improvements of over 85% compared to other approaches. MoRPI-PINN
is a lightweight approach that can be implemented even on edge devices and used
in any typical mobile robot application.

Result: 在丰富家庭和稀疏实验室环境中，ReSem3D在零样本条件下完成多样化操作任务，表现出强适应性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ReSem3D通过语义驱动的3D空间约束，有效统一任务理解与执行，为复杂环境下的机器人操作提供了新思路。

Abstract: Semantics-driven 3D spatial constraints align highlevel semantic
representations with low-level action spaces, facilitating the unification of
task understanding and execution in robotic manipulation. The synergistic
reasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation
Models (VFMs) enables cross-modal 3D spatial constraint construction.
Nevertheless, existing methods have three key limitations: (1) coarse semantic
granularity in constraint modeling, (2) lack of real-time closed-loop planning,
(3) compromised robustness in semantically diverse environments. To address
these challenges, we propose ReSem3D, a unified manipulation framework for
semantically diverse environments, leveraging the synergy between VFMs and
MLLMs to achieve fine-grained visual grounding and dynamically constructs
hierarchical 3D spatial constraints for real-time manipulation. Specifically,
the framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which
interact with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from
natural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level
extraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are

TL;DR: 论文测试了MediaPipe算法在手术灯光下检测面部标志的准确性，发现其在大角度偏转时性能提升，但存在标准偏差增加的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决面部检测算法在手术中因光线和位置变化导致的精度问题。

Method: 使用机械臂自动调整位置，在固定手术灯光和模型下测试MediaPipe算法。

Result: 算法在大偏转角度下检测性能提升，但标准偏差增加。

Conclusion: MediaPipe算法有望整合到医疗程序中，但需解决精度问题。

Abstract: The use of robotics, computer vision, and their applications is becoming
increasingly widespread in various fields, including medicine. Many face
detection algorithms have found applications in neurosurgery, ophthalmology,
and plastic surgery. A common challenge in using these algorithms is variable
lighting conditions and the flexibility of detection positions to identify and
precisely localize patients. The proposed experiment tests the MediaPipe
algorithm for detecting facial landmarks in a controlled setting, using a
robotic arm that automatically adjusts positions while the surgical light and
the phantom remain in a fixed position. The results of this study demonstrate
that the improved accuracy of facial landmark detection under surgical lighting
significantly enhances the detection performance at larger yaw and pitch
angles. The increase in standard deviation/dispersion occurs due to imprecise
detection of selected facial landmarks. This analysis allows for a discussion
on the potential integration of the MediaPipe algorithm into medical
procedures.

TL;DR: AdaRPG框架通过利用基础模型提取物体部件，增强视觉功能泛化能力，解决关节物体操纵中的几何多样性和功能差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关节物体的内部结构不可直接观察，且几何多样性和功能差异导致现有方法难以实现跨类别泛化。

Method: 提出AdaRPG框架，利用基础模型提取部件以增强视觉功能泛化，并构建部件级功能标注数据集训练功能模型。

Result: 仿真和真实实验表明AdaRPG在新型关节物体类别上具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: AdaRPG通过部件级功能推理和基础模型知识，实现了跨类别关节物体操纵的泛化。

Abstract: Articulated objects pose diverse manipulation challenges for robots. Since
their internal structures are not directly observable, robots must adaptively
explore and refine actions to generate successful manipulation trajectories.
While existing works have attempted cross-category generalization in adaptive
articulated object manipulation, two major challenges persist: (1) the
geometric diversity of real-world articulated objects complicates visual
perception and understanding, and (2) variations in object functions and
mechanisms hinder the development of a unified adaptive manipulation strategy.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaRPG, a novel framework that
leverages foundation models to extract object parts, which exhibit greater
local geometric similarity than entire objects, thereby enhancing visual
affordance generalization for functional primitive skills. To support this, we
construct a part-level affordance annotation dataset to train the affordance
model. Additionally, AdaRPG utilizes the common knowledge embedded in
foundation models to reason about complex mechanisms and generate high-level
control codes that invoke primitive skill functions based on part affordance
inference. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate AdaRPG's strong
generalization ability across novel articulated object categories.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为pact的SMT模型计数器，用于处理混合公式的近似模型计数，性能显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SMT求解器在混合公式的模型计数方面存在局限性，尤其是对离散变量的投影计数。

Method: pact采用基于哈希的近似模型计数方法，通过优化的哈希函数和对数级SMT求解器调用实现。

Result: 在14,202个实例中，pact成功完成603个，而基线方法仅完成13个。

Conclusion: pact为混合SMT公式的模型计数提供了高效且理论保证的解决方案。

Abstract: Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers have advanced automated reasoning,
solving complex formulas across discrete and continuous domains. Recent
progress in propositional model counting motivates extending SMT capabilities
toward model counting, especially for hybrid SMT formulas. Existing approaches,
like bit-blasting, are limited to discrete variables, highlighting the
challenge of counting solutions projected onto the discrete domain in hybrid
formulas.
  We introduce pact, an SMT model counter for hybrid formulas that uses
hashing-based approximate model counting to estimate solutions with theoretical
guarantees. pact makes a logarithmic number of SMT solver calls relative to the
projection variables, leveraging optimized hash functions. pact achieves
significant performance improvements over baselines on a large suite of
benchmarks. In particular, out of 14,202 instances, pact successfully finished
on 603 instances, while Baseline could only finish on 13 instances.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的端到端模型，用于说话者角色分离（RD），通过简化训练、独立任务预测器和利用RD后验活动优化ASR解码。


<details>

Motivation: 传统说话者分离（SD）仅提供通用标签，而角色分离（RD）更具应用价值。

Method: 采用强制对齐和交叉熵损失简化训练，设计独立任务预测器，并利用RD后验活动优化ASR解码。

Result: 模型在角色分离任务中表现更优，同时减少了ASR解码中的小词删除错误。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了角色分离的准确性和ASR性能。

Abstract: From an application standpoint, speaker-role diarization (RD), such as doctor
vs. patient, host vs. guest, etc. is often more useful than traditional speaker
diarization (SD), which assigns generic labels like speaker-1, speaker-2 etc.
In the context of joint automatic speech recognition (ASR) + SD (who spoke
what?), recent end-to-end models employ an auxiliary SD transducer,
synchronized with the ASR transducer, to predict speakers per word. In this
paper, we extend this framework to RD with three key contributions: (1) we
simplify the training via forced alignment and cross-entropy loss instead of
RNNT loss, (2) we show that word prediction and role prediction require
different amounts of predictor's context, leading to separate task-specific
predictors, unlike existing shared-predictor models, and (3) we propose a way
to leverage RD posterior activity to influence ASR decoding and reduce
small-word deletion errors.

Abstract: The CHiME-7 and 8 distant speech recognition (DASR) challenges focus on
multi-channel, generalizable, joint automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
diarization of conversational speech. With participation from 9 teams
submitting 32 diverse systems, these challenges have contributed to
state-of-the-art research in the field. This paper outlines the challenges'
design, evaluation metrics, datasets, and baseline systems while analyzing key
trends from participant submissions. From this analysis it emerges that: 1)
Most participants use end-to-end (e2e) ASR systems, whereas hybrid systems were
prevalent in previous CHiME challenges. This transition is mainly due to the
availability of robust large-scale pre-trained models, which lowers the data
burden for e2e-ASR. 2) Despite recent advances in neural speech separation and
enhancement (SSE), all teams still heavily rely on guided source separation,
suggesting that current neural SSE techniques are still unable to reliably deal
with complex scenarios and different recording setups. 3) All best systems
employ diarization refinement via target-speaker diarization techniques.
Accurate speaker counting in the first diarization pass is thus crucial to
avoid compounding errors and CHiME-8 DASR participants especially focused on
this part. 4) Downstream evaluation via meeting summarization can correlate
weakly with transcription quality due to the remarkable effectiveness of
large-language models in handling errors. On the NOTSOFAR-1 scenario, even
systems with over 50\% time-constrained minimum permutation WER can perform
roughly on par with the most effective ones (around 11\%). 5) Despite recent
progress, accurately transcribing spontaneous speech in challenging acoustic
environments remains difficult, even when using computationally intensive
system ensembles.

Abstract: Voice disorders affect a significant portion of the population, and the
ability to diagnose them using automated, non-invasive techniques would
represent a substantial advancement in healthcare, improving the quality of
life of patients. Recent studies have demonstrated that artificial intelligence
models, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), can effectively address this
task. However, due to their complexity, the decision-making process of such
models often remain opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in clinical
contexts. This paper investigates an alternative approach based on Explainable
AI (XAI), a field that aims to improve the interpretability of DNNs by
providing different forms of explanations. Specifically, this works focuses on
concept-based models such as Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) and Concept
Embedding Model (CEM) and how they can achieve performance comparable to
traditional deep learning methods, while offering a more transparent and
interpretable decision framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rumsfeld无知可以通过无知定义，导致现有结果和公理化问题变得平凡。为了解决这一问题，作者假设两种可达关系不同。

Method: 假设两种可达关系不同，其中一种是另一种的任意子集，避免了可定义性问题。

Result: 提出了多种适当双框架类上的公理化结果，并应用于分析Fine的结论。

Conclusion: 通过区分两种可达关系，解决了Rumsfeld无知的可定义性问题，并保留了大部分有效性。

Abstract: In a recent paper, Kit Fine presents some striking results concerning the
logical properties of (first-order) ignorance, second-order ignorance and
Rumsfeld ignorance. However, Rumsfeld ignorance is definable in terms of
ignorance, which makes some existing results and the axiomatization problem
trivial. A main reason is that the accessibility relations for the implicit
knowledge operator contained in the packaged operators of ignorance and
Rumsfeld ignorance are the same. In this work, we assume the two accessibility
relations to be different so that one of them is an arbitrary subset of the
other. This will avoid the definability issue and retain most of the previous
validities. The main results are axiomatizations over various proper bi-frame
classes. Finally we apply our framework to analyze Fine's results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学基础模型在临床应用中可能因学习非生物技术特征（如手术/内窥镜技术、实验室程序、扫描仪硬件等）而产生风险，需要系统评估其鲁棒性。

Method: 提出PathoROB基准，包含三个新指标和四个数据集，评估了20种FMs的鲁棒性，并开发了鲁棒化框架以减少错误。

Result: 所有评估的FMs均存在鲁棒性不足问题，非鲁棒性可能导致重大诊断错误；使用更鲁棒的FMs和后处理鲁棒化可降低风险。

Conclusion: 鲁棒性评估是临床采用FMs前的必要步骤，未来FMs开发需将鲁棒性作为核心设计原则，PathoROB为跨生物医学领域的鲁棒性评估提供了蓝图。

Abstract: Biomedical Foundation Models (FMs) are rapidly transforming AI-enabled
healthcare research and entering clinical validation. However, their
susceptibility to learning non-biological technical features -- including
variations in surgical/endoscopic techniques, laboratory procedures, and
scanner hardware -- poses risks for clinical deployment. We present the first
systematic investigation of pathology FM robustness to non-biological features.
Our work (i) introduces measures to quantify FM robustness, (ii) demonstrates
the consequences of limited robustness, and (iii) proposes a framework for FM
robustification to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we developed PathoROB,
a robustness benchmark with three novel metrics, including the robustness
index, and four datasets covering 28 biological classes from 34 medical
centers. Our experiments reveal robustness deficits across all 20 evaluated
FMs, and substantial robustness differences between them. We found that
non-robust FM representations can cause major diagnostic downstream errors and
clinical blunders that prevent safe clinical adoption. Using more robust FMs
and post-hoc robustification considerably reduced (but did not yet eliminate)
the risk of such errors. This work establishes that robustness evaluation is
essential for validating pathology FMs before clinical adoption and
demonstrates that future FM development must integrate robustness as a core
design principle. PathoROB provides a blueprint for assessing robustness across
biomedical domains, guiding FM improvement efforts towards more robust,
representative, and clinically deployable AI systems that prioritize biological
information over technical artifacts.

Method: 利用张量网络建模，将3D卷积核表示为低维张量，减少参数量的同时捕捉空间依赖性。

Result: 在三个脑MRI数据集上表现优异，仅需原始模型0.3%的可训练参数，MS-SSIM指标领先。

Conclusion: TenVOO是一种高效且性能优越的3D扩散模型微调方法，适用于MRI图像生成。

Abstract: We address the challenge of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for
three-dimensional (3D) U-Net-based denoising diffusion probabilistic models
(DDPMs) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image generation. Despite its
practical significance, research on parameter-efficient representations of 3D
convolution operations remains limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Tensor
Volumetric Operator (TenVOO), a novel PEFT method specifically designed for
fine-tuning DDPMs with 3D convolutional backbones. Leveraging tensor network
modeling, TenVOO represents 3D convolution kernels with lower-dimensional
tensors, effectively capturing complex spatial dependencies during fine-tuning
with few parameters. We evaluate TenVOO on three downstream brain MRI
datasets-ADNI, PPMI, and BraTS2021-by fine-tuning a DDPM pretrained on 59,830
T1-weighted brain MRI scans from the UK Biobank. Our results demonstrate that
TenVOO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scale structural
similarity index measure (MS-SSIM), outperforming existing approaches in
capturing spatial dependencies while requiring only 0.3% of the trainable
parameters of the original model. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Glioblastoma, a highly aggressive brain tumor with diverse molecular and
pathological features, poses a diagnostic challenge due to its heterogeneity.
Accurate diagnosis and assessment of this heterogeneity are essential for
choosing the right treatment and improving patient outcomes. Traditional
methods rely on identifying specific features in tissue samples, but deep
learning offers a promising approach for improved glioblastoma diagnosis. In
this paper, we present our approach to the BraTS-Path Challenge 2024. We
leverage a pre-trained model and fine-tune it on the BraTS-Path training
dataset. Our model demonstrates poor performance on the challenging BraTS-Path
validation set, as rigorously assessed by the Synapse online platform. The
model achieves an accuracy of 0.392229, a recall of 0.392229, and a F1-score of
0.392229, indicating a consistent ability to correctly identify instances under
the target condition. Notably, our model exhibits perfect specificity of
0.898704, showing an exceptional capacity to correctly classify negative cases.
Moreover, a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.255267 is calculated,
to signify a limited positive correlation between predicted and actual values
and highlight our model's overall predictive power. Our solution also achieves
the second place during the testing phase.

Abstract: Nitrogen (N) is one of the most crucial nutrients in vineyards, affecting
plant growth and subsequent products such as wine and juice. Because soil N has
high spatial and temporal variability, it is desirable to accurately estimate
the N concentration of grapevine leaves and manage fertilization at the
individual plant level to optimally meet plant needs. In this study, we used
in-field hyperspectral images with wavelengths ranging from $400 to 1000nm of
four different grapevine cultivars collected from distinct vineyards and over
two growth stages during two growing seasons to develop models for predicting N
concentration at the leaf-level and canopy-level. After image processing, two
feature selection methods were employed to identify the optimal set of spectral
bands that were responsive to leaf N concentrations. The selected spectral
bands were used to train and test two different Machine Learning (ML) models,
Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, for predicting nitrogen concentrations. The
comparison of selected bands for both leaf-level and canopy-level datasets
showed that most of the spectral regions identified by the feature selection
methods were across both methods and the dataset types (leaf- and canopy-level
datasets), particularly in the key regions, 500-525nm, 650-690nm, 750-800nm,
and 900-950nm. These findings indicated the robustness of these spectral
regions for predicting nitrogen content. The results for N prediction
demonstrated that the ML model achieved an R square of 0.49 for canopy-level
data and an R square of 0.57 for leaf-level data, despite using different sets
of selected spectral bands for each analysis level. The study demonstrated the
potential of using in-field hyperspectral imaging and the use of spectral data
in integrated feature selection and ML techniques to monitor N status in
vineyards.

TL;DR: MEP-Diffusion是一种基于扩散模型的生成先验方法，用于增强多切片电子衍射成像（MEP）的迭代求解器，显著提升了重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MEP算法因逆问题的不适定性导致耗时且解质量不佳，需要改进。

Method: 开发MEP-Diffusion扩散模型，通过扩散后验采样（DPS）整合为生成先验。

Result: 混合方法使重建3D体积质量显著提升，SSIM提高90.50%。

Conclusion: MEP-Diffusion有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了重建效果。

Abstract: Multislice electron ptychography (MEP) is an inverse imaging technique that
computationally reconstructs the highest-resolution images of atomic crystal
structures from diffraction patterns. Available algorithms often solve this
inverse problem iteratively but are both time consuming and produce suboptimal
solutions due to their ill-posed nature. We develop MEP-Diffusion, a diffusion
model trained on a large database of crystal structures specifically for MEP to
augment existing iterative solvers. MEP-Diffusion is easily integrated as a
generative prior into existing reconstruction methods via Diffusion Posterior
Sampling (DPS). We find that this hybrid approach greatly enhances the quality
of the reconstructed 3D volumes, achieving a 90.50% improvement in SSIM over
existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层扩散框架，通过两个垂直的2D阶段（轴向和冠状）实现伪健康MRI图像修复，平衡数据效率和体积一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有2D方法在体积连续性上的不足和3D方法对大量训练数据的需求问题。

Method: 采用轴向扩散模型生成全局一致的粗修复，再用冠状扩散模型细化解剖细节，结合自适应重采样。

Result: 在真实性和体积一致性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为伪健康MRI图像修复提供了一种高效且一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Pseudo-healthy image inpainting is an essential preprocessing step for
analyzing pathological brain MRI scans. Most current inpainting methods favor
slice-wise 2D models for their high in-plane fidelity, but their independence
across slices produces discontinuities in the volume. Fully 3D models alleviate
this issue, but their high model capacity demands extensive training data for
reliable, high-fidelity synthesis -- often impractical in medical settings. We
address these limitations with a hierarchical diffusion framework by replacing
direct 3D modeling with two perpendicular coarse-to-fine 2D stages. An axial
diffusion model first yields a coarse, globally consistent inpainting; a
coronal diffusion model then refines anatomical details. By combining
perpendicular spatial views with adaptive resampling, our method balances data
efficiency and volumetric consistency. Our experiments show our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both realism and volumetric
consistency, making it a promising solution for pseudo-healthy image
inpainting. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI腹部分割因信号多变性和标注难度而更具挑战性，现有方法训练数据有限，泛化能力不足。

Method: 对三种开源模型（MRSegmentator、MRISegmentator-Abdomen、TotalSegmentator MRI）进行综合评估，并引入基于CT训练的ABDSynth模型。

Result: MRSegmentator表现最优且泛化能力最强，ABDSynth精度稍低但标注需求更少。

Conclusion: MRSegmentator是首选工具，ABDSynth适用于标注资源有限的情况，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to robust automated tools for
segmentation of abdominal computed tomography (CT). Meanwhile, segmentation of
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is substantially more challenging due to the
inherent signal variability and the increased effort required for annotating
training datasets. Hence, existing approaches are trained on limited sets of
MRI sequences, which might limit their generalizability. To characterize the
landscape of MRI abdominal segmentation tools, we present here a comprehensive
benchmarking of the three state-of-the-art and open-source models:
MRSegmentator, MRISegmentator-Abdomen, and TotalSegmentator MRI. Since these
models are trained using labor-intensive manual annotation cycles, we also
introduce and evaluate ABDSynth, a SynthSeg-based model purely trained on
widely available CT segmentations (no real images). More generally, we assess
accuracy and generalizability by leveraging three public datasets (not seen by
any of the evaluated methods during their training), which span all major
manufacturers, five MRI sequences, as well as a variety of subject conditions,
voxel resolutions, and fields-of-view. Our results reveal that MRSegmentator
achieves the best performance and is most generalizable. In contrast, ABDSynth
yields slightly less accurate results, but its relaxed requirements in training
data make it an alternative when the annotation budget is limited. The
evaluation code and datasets are given for future benchmarking at
https://github.com/deepakri201/AbdoBench, along with inference code and weights
for ABDSynth.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的双能X射线CT材料分解方法DEcomp-MoD，直接处理投影数据，结合模型和扩散先验，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在图像域进行材料分解，未考虑束硬化效应，效果不佳。

Method: 结合光谱DECT模型和基于评分的去噪扩散先验，直接处理投影数据生成材料图像。

Result: 在低剂量AAPM数据集上定量和定性评估显示，DEcomp-MoD优于现有无监督和监督方法。

Conclusion: DEcomp-MoD具有临床诊断潜力，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Dual-energy X-ray Computed Tomography (DECT) constitutes an advanced
technology which enables automatic decomposition of materials in clinical
images without manual segmentation using the dependency of the X-ray linear
attenuation with energy. However, most methods perform material decomposition
in the image domain as a post-processing step after reconstruction but this
procedure does not account for the beam-hardening effect and it results in
sub-optimal results. In this work, we propose a deep learning procedure called
Dual-Energy Decomposition Model-based Diffusion (DEcomp-MoD) for quantitative
material decomposition which directly converts the DECT projection data into
material images. The algorithm is based on incorporating the knowledge of the
spectral DECT model into the deep learning training loss and combining a
score-based denoising diffusion learned prior in the material image domain.
Importantly the inference optimization loss takes as inputs directly the
sinogram and converts to material images through a model-based conditional
diffusion model which guarantees consistency of the results. We evaluate the
performance with both quantitative and qualitative estimation of the proposed
DEcomp-MoD method on synthetic DECT sinograms from the low-dose AAPM dataset.
Finally, we show that DEcomp-MoD outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised
score-based model and supervised deep learning networks, with the potential to
be deployed for clinical diagnosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散概率模型（DPM）在生成任务中表现优异，但现有训练和推理策略导致注意力分布不均，影响病灶分割效果。

Method: 提出UniSegDiff框架，采用分阶段训练和推理，动态调整预测目标，并通过预训练特征提取网络实现统一分割。

Result: 在多种成像模态和六个不同器官上的实验表明，UniSegDiff显著优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: UniSegDiff通过优化注意力分布和统一分割方法，为病灶分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) has demonstrated remarkable
performance across a variety of generative tasks. The inherent randomness in
diffusion models helps address issues such as blurring at the edges of medical
images and labels, positioning Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) as a
promising approach for lesion segmentation. However, we find that the current
training and inference strategies of diffusion models result in an uneven
distribution of attention across different timesteps, leading to longer
training times and suboptimal solutions. To this end, we propose UniSegDiff, a
novel diffusion model framework designed to address lesion segmentation in a
unified manner across multiple modalities and organs. This framework introduces
a staged training and inference approach, dynamically adjusting the prediction
targets at different stages, forcing the model to maintain high attention
across all timesteps, and achieves unified lesion segmentation through
pre-training the feature extraction network for segmentation. We evaluate
performance on six different organs across various imaging modalities.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that UniSegDiff significantly
outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. The code is available

Abstract: Multimodal large models have shown great potential in automating pathology
image analysis. However, current multimodal models for gastrointestinal
pathology are constrained by both data quality and reasoning transparency:
pervasive noise and incomplete annotations in public datasets predispose vision
language models to factual hallucinations when generating diagnostic text,
while the absence of explicit intermediate reasoning chains renders the outputs
difficult to audit and thus less trustworthy in clinical practice. To address
these issues, we construct a large scale gastrointestinal pathology dataset
containing both microscopic descriptions and diagnostic conclusions, and
propose a prompt argumentation strategy that incorporates lesion classification
and anatomical site information. This design guides the model to better capture
image specific features and maintain semantic consistency in generation.
Furthermore, we employ a post training pipeline that combines supervised fine
tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning
quality and output structure. Experimental results on real world pathology
report generation tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
state of the art open source and proprietary baselines in terms of generation
quality, structural completeness, and clinical relevance. Our solution
outperforms state of the art models with 18.7% higher clinical relevance, 32.4%
improved structural completeness, and 41.2% fewer diagnostic errors,
demonstrating superior accuracy and clinical utility compared to existing
solutions.

Conclusion: GINs适合数据丰富的环境，GATs适合数据稀缺的环境，且GINs在超参数优化上表现出独特性。

Abstract: Geometric deep learning is an emerging technique in Artificial Intelligence
(AI) driven cheminformatics, however the unique implications of different Graph
Neural Network (GNN) architectures are poorly explored, for this space. This
study compared performances of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph
Attention Networks (GATs) and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GINs), applied to 7
different toxicological assay datasets of varying data abundance and endpoint,
to perform binary classification of assay activation. Following pre-processing
of molecular graphs, enforcement of class-balance and stratification of all
datasets across 5 folds, Bayesian optimisations were carried out, for each GNN
applied to each assay dataset (resulting in 21 unique Bayesian optimisations).
Optimised GNNs performed at Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores ranging from
0.728-0.849 (averaged across all folds), naturally varying between specific
assays and GNNs. GINs were found to consistently outperform GCNs and GATs, for
the top 5 of 7 most data-abundant toxicological assays. GATs however
significantly outperformed over the remaining 2 most data-scarce assays. This
indicates that GINs are a more optimal architecture for data-abundant
environments, whereas GATs are a more optimal architecture for data-scarce
environments. Subsequent analysis of the explored higher-dimensional
hyperparameter spaces, as well as optimised hyperparameter states, found that
GCNs and GATs reached measurably closer optimised states with each other,
compared to GINs, further indicating the unique nature of GINs as a GNN
algorithm.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of coronary arteries remains a significant challenge in
clinical practice, hindering the ability to effectively diagnose and manage
coronary artery disease. The lack of large, annotated datasets for model
training exacerbates this issue, limiting the development of automated tools
that could assist radiologists. To address this, we introduce CM-UNet, which
leverages self-supervised pre-training on unannotated datasets and transfer
learning on limited annotated data, enabling accurate disease detection while
minimizing the need for extensive manual annotations. Fine-tuning CM-UNet with
only 18 annotated images instead of 500 resulted in a 15.2% decrease in Dice
score, compared to a 46.5% drop in baseline models without pre-training. This
demonstrates that self-supervised learning can enhance segmentation performance
and reduce dependence on large datasets. This is one of the first studies to
highlight the importance of self-supervised learning in improving coronary
artery segmentation from X-ray angiography, with potential implications for
advancing diagnostic accuracy in clinical practice. By enhancing segmentation
accuracy in X-ray angiography images, the proposed approach aims to improve
clinical workflows, reduce radiologists' workload, and accelerate disease
detection, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes. The source code

Conclusion: KOLs在技术不确定性时期通过叙事塑造公众注意力，是连接未来想象与现实的关键中介。

Abstract: The volatility and unpredictability of emerging technologies, such as
artificial intelligence (AI), generate significant uncertainty, which is widely
discussed on social media. This study examines anticipatory discourse
surrounding technological futures by analysing 1.5 million posts from 400 key
opinion leaders (KOLs) published on the X platform (from 2021 to 2023). Using
advanced text mining techniques, including BERTopic modelling, sentiment,
emotion, and attitude analyses, the research identifies 100 distinct topics
reflecting anticipated tech-driven futures. Our findings emphasize the dual
role of KOLs in framing \textit{present futures} -- optimistic visions of
transformative technologies like AI and IoT -- and influencing \textit{future
presents}, where these projections shape contemporary societal and geopolitical
debates. Positive emotions such as Hope dominate, outweighing Anxiety,
particularly in topics like ``Machine Learning, Data Science, and Deep
Learning,'' while discussions around ``Climate Change'' and ``War, Ukraine, and
Trump People'' elicit \textit{Anxiety}. By framing technologies as solutions to
societal challenges, KOLs act as mediators of societal narratives, bridging
imagined futures and current realities. These insights underscore their pivotal
role in directing public attention with emerging technologies during periods of
heightened uncertainty, advancing our understanding of anticipatory discourse
in technology-mediated contexts.

Motivation: 多电子倍增现象会严重影响高功率射频设备和加速器系统的性能，但其预测计算量大且复杂，因此需要更高效的方法。

Method: 使用模拟数据集训练多种回归模型（如随机森林、XGBoost等），并通过IoU、SSIM和Pearson相关系数评估性能。

Result: 基于树的模型在跨材料域泛化中表现优于MLPs；MLPs通过多目标优化表现更好；PCA显示某些材料性能下降源于特征空间分布不连续。

Conclusion: 研究展示了机器学习在多电子倍增预测中的潜力与局限性，为加速器和射频系统设计的数据驱动建模奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multipactor is a nonlinear electron avalanche phenomenon that can severely
impair the performance of high-power radio frequency (RF) devices and
accelerator systems. Accurate prediction of multipactor susceptibility across
different materials and operational regimes remains a critical yet
computationally intensive challenge in accelerator component design and RF
engineering. This study presents the first application of supervised machine
learning (ML) for predicting multipactor susceptibility in two-surface planar
geometries. A simulation-derived dataset spanning six distinct secondary
electron yield (SEY) material profiles is used to train regression models -
including Random Forest (RF), Extra Trees (ET), Extreme Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost), and funnel-structured Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) - to predict the
time-averaged electron growth rate, ${\delta}_{avg}$. Performance is evaluated
using Intersection over Union (IoU), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and
Pearson correlation coefficient. Tree-based models consistently outperform MLPs
in generalizing across disjoint material domains. MLPs trained using a
scalarized objective function that combines IoU and SSIM during Bayesian
hyperparameter optimization with 5-fold cross-validation outperform those
trained with single-objective loss functions. Principal Component Analysis
reveals that performance degradation for certain materials stems from disjoint
feature-space distributions, underscoring the need for broader dataset
coverage. This study demonstrates both the promise and limitations of ML-based
multipactor prediction and lays the groundwork for accelerated, data-driven
modeling in advanced RF and accelerator system design.

Conclusion: 该方法为未来多模态大脑编码基准提供了一个简单且可扩展的基线。

Abstract: Accurately predicting distributed cortical responses to naturalistic stimuli
requires models that integrate visual, auditory and semantic information over
time. We present a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps
pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series recorded
while four subjects watched almost 80 hours of movies provided by the Algonauts
2025 challenge. Modality-specific bidirectional RNNs encode temporal dynamics;
their hidden states are fused and passed to a second recurrent layer, and
lightweight subject-specific heads output responses for 1000 cortical parcels.
Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that
gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions.
Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system
ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r =
0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all
participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject
(Subject 5). The approach establishes a simple, extensible baseline for future

Conclusion: 智能缓存策略提高了联邦学习的可扩展性和内存效率，适用于边缘物联网网络，为智能城市和医疗等延迟敏感应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple distributed devices to jointly train

updates, our approach lowers bandwidth usage while maintaining model accuracy.
Experiments on CIFAR-10 and medical datasets show reduced communication with

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SN9中模型本地化和"赢家通吃"奖励机制的问题，实现更高效、公平的去中心化预训练。

Method: 引入IOTA架构，包括数据与管道并行SWARM架构、连续激励、激活压缩、Butterfly All-Reduce和CLASP公平归因方案。

Result: 实现了模型规模随参与者数量扩展、通信带宽减少128倍、线性可扩展性和公平贡献评估。

Conclusion: IOTA通过协作和公平激励解决了SN9的局限性，为去中心化预训练提供了更优方案。

Abstract: In August 2024, Bittensor's Subnet 9 (SN9) demonstrated that a distributed
network of incentivized, permissionless actors could each pretrain large
language models (LLMs) ranging from 700 million to 14 billion parameters, while
surpassing established baselines. While that work validated blockchain-based
decentralized pretraining as viable, it contained core issues: (i) every miner
had to fit an entire model locally, and (ii) "winner-takes-all" rewards
encouraged model hoarding.
  Here we introduce IOTA (Incentivized Orchestrated Training Architecture), an
architecture that addresses these limitations by transforming SN9's previously
isolated competitors into a single cooperating unit that can scale arbitrarily
while still rewarding each contributor fairly.
  Key preliminary results: (1) Data- and Pipeline-parallel SWARM architecture -
An orchestrator distributes model layers across heterogeneous miners and
streams activations between them, enabling model sizes to scale with the number
of participants rather than being constrained by the VRAM of a single machine;
(2) Granular, continuous incentives - Validators measure each miner's
contribution and allocate token emissions proportionally; (3) Activation
compression - We used model-bottlenecks to cut communication bandwidths of
activations by up to 128x, vastly improving training speed; (4) Butterfly
All-Reduce - Miners average disjoint parameter slices in O(1) bandwidth,
offering linear scalability, redundancy and built-in collusion detection; (5)
CLASP (Contribution Loss Assessment via Sampling of Pathways) - A fair
attribution scheme assigns credit to miners proportional to their marginal
utility and detects exploits, even when contributions are interdependent across
the pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统将任务简单分为延迟敏感（LS）和尽力而为（BE），忽略了延迟敏感任务内部的多样性，导致用户体验和调度效率不佳。

Method: PolyServe通过将请求按每令牌延迟需求分组，并调度到服务器子集，利用负载梯度实现自动扩展，同时允许宽松SLO请求共享严格SLO实例以提高利用率。

Result: PolyServe实现了1.23倍的吞吐量增益，达到最优吞吐量的92.5%。

Conclusion: PolyServe在满足多种SLO需求的同时，显著提升了系统性能和资源利用率。

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a surge of LLM-powered
applications. These applications have diverse token-generation latency
requirements. As a result, simply classifying workloads as latency-sensitive
(LS) or best-effort (BE) overlooks the nuances within the latency-sensitive
category and results in suboptimal user experiences and scheduling
opportunities. However, efficiently serving requests with multiple SLO
requirements poses significant challenges. First, all requests within a batch
generate new tokens simultaneously, which can misalign them with their distinct
SLO requirements. Moreover, while existing systems focus on auto-scaling for
handling various overall request rates, the diversity of SLOs necessitates
fine-grained auto-scaling among these SLO tiers. Finally, unlike LS/BE
scenarios, where BE requests can be aborted at any time to ensure the SLO
attainment of LS requests, those with different latency-sensitive SLOs cannot
tolerate prolonged delays, and tail latency must be controlled.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose PolyServe, a novel multi-SLO
scheduling policy at scale that maintains high SLO attainment while maximizing
throughput. PolyServe first groups requests into multiple bins based on their
per-token latency requirement, then schedules each bin to a subset of the
server fleet. PolyServe routes requests to the highest-load but still
SLO-attainable server to create a load gradient that facilitates auto-scaling.
To increase utilization, PolyServe permits looser-SLO requests to share
tighter-SLO instances when their own servers are saturated. PolyServe uses
profiling data to guide scheduling decisions and manage tail latency through
request-wait-time-aware scheduling, dynamic chunking, and continuous chunked
prefill prediction. PolyServe achieves 1.23x goodput gain compared to existing
policies, achieving up to 92.5% of optimal goodput.

Abstract: The automatic generation of deep learning (DL) kernels using large language
models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to reduce the manual effort
and hardware-specific expertise required for writing high-performance operator
implementations. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in this
domain suffer from limited hardware support, coarse-grained kernel
categorization, and imbalanced task coverage. To address these limitations, we
introduce MultiKernelBench, the first comprehensive, multi-platform benchmark
for LLM-based DL kernel generation. MultiKernelBench spans 285 tasks across 14
well-defined kernel categories and supports three major hardware platforms:
Nvidia GPUs, Huawei NPUs, and Google TPUs. To enable future extensibility, we
design a modular backend abstraction layer that decouples platform-specific
logic from the core benchmarking infrastructure, allowing easy integration of
new hardware platforms. We further propose a simple yet effective
category-aware one-shot prompting method that improves generation quality by
providing in-category exemplars. Through systematic evaluations of seven
state-of-the-art LLMs, we reveal significant variation in task difficulty, poor
generalization to platforms with less training exposure, and the effectiveness
of targeted prompting strategies. MultiKernelBench is publicly available at
https://github.com/wzzll123/MultiKernelBench.

Abstract: We develop a deep variational free energy framework to compute the equation
of state of hydrogen in the warm dense matter region. This method parameterizes
the variational density matrix of hydrogen nuclei and electrons at finite
temperature using three deep generative models: a normalizing flow model that
represents the Boltzmann distribution of the classical nuclei, an
autoregressive transformer that models the distribution of electrons in excited
states, and a permutational equivariant flow model that constructs backflow
coordinates for electrons in Hartree-Fock orbitals. By jointly optimizing the
three neural networks to minimize the variational free energy, we obtain the
equation of state and related thermodynamic properties of dense hydrogen. We
compare our results with other theoretical and experimental results on the
deuterium Hugoniot curve, aiming to resolve existing discrepancies. The
calculated results provide a valuable benchmark for deuterium in the warm dense
matter region.
