Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个电信运营调度评估基准TeleEval-OS，包含15个数据集和13个子任务，评估了10个开源和4个闭源大语言模型在不同场景下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电信运营调度任务复杂且缺乏评估基准，阻碍了大语言模型在该领域的应用潜力探索。

Method: 构建TeleEval-OS基准，涵盖四个运营阶段和四个能力层级，采用零样本和少样本评估方法。

Result: 开源大语言模型在特定场景下表现优于闭源模型，展示了其在电信运营调度中的潜力。

Conclusion: TeleEval-OS填补了研究空白，为大语言模型在电信运营调度中的应用提供了系统评估工具。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled progress in artificial intelligence, demonstrating substantial
application potential across multiple specialized domains. Telecommunications
operation scheduling (OS) is a critical aspect of the telecommunications
industry, involving the coordinated management of networks, services, risks,
and human resources to optimize production scheduling and ensure unified
service control. However, the inherent complexity and domain-specific nature of
OS tasks, coupled with the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, have
hindered thorough exploration of LLMs' application potential in this critical
field. To address this research gap, we propose the first Telecommunications
Operation Scheduling Evaluation Benchmark (TeleEval-OS). Specifically, this
benchmark comprises 15 datasets across 13 subtasks, comprehensively simulating
four key operational stages: intelligent ticket creation, intelligent ticket
handling, intelligent ticket closure, and intelligent evaluation. To
systematically assess the performance of LLMs on tasks of varying complexity,
we categorize their capabilities in telecommunications operation scheduling
into four hierarchical levels, arranged in ascending order of difficulty: basic
NLP, knowledge Q&A, report generation, and report analysis. On TeleEval-OS, we
leverage zero-shot and few-shot evaluation methods to comprehensively assess 10
open-source LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-V3) and 4 closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o)
across diverse scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that open-source
LLMs can outperform closed-source LLMs in specific scenarios, highlighting
their significant potential and value in the field of telecommunications
operation scheduling.

### [2] [Who is in the Spotlight: The Hidden Bias Undermining Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11063)
*Jiayu Yao,Shenghua Liu,Yiwei Wang,Lingrui Mei,Baolong Bi,Yuyao Ge,Zhecheng Li,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了多模态检索增强生成（RAG）系统中证据位置对性能的影响，发现位置偏差显著且随模态多样性增加而加剧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG模型对证据顺序高度敏感，导致性能不稳定和推理偏差，尤其在多模态任务中。

Method: 通过文本、图像及混合模态任务的实验，提出位置敏感指数（PSI_p）和可视化框架分析注意力分配。

Result: 多模态交互加剧位置偏差，偏差随检索范围对数增长。

Conclusion: 需采用证据重排序或去偏策略，以构建更可靠、公平的生成系统。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become essential
in knowledge-intensive and open-domain tasks. As retrieval complexity
increases, ensuring the robustness of these systems is critical. However,
current RAG models are highly sensitive to the order in which evidence is
presented, often resulting in unstable performance and biased reasoning,
particularly as the number of retrieved items or modality diversity grows. This
raises a central question: How does the position of retrieved evidence affect
multimodal RAG performance? To answer this, we present the first comprehensive
study of position bias in multimodal RAG systems. Through controlled
experiments across text-only, image-only, and mixed-modality tasks, we observe
a consistent U-shaped accuracy curve with respect to evidence position. To
quantify this bias, we introduce the Position Sensitivity Index ($PSI_p$) and
develop a visualization framework to trace attention allocation patterns across
decoder layers. Our results reveal that multimodal interactions intensify
position bias compared to unimodal settings, and that this bias increases
logarithmically with retrieval range. These findings offer both theoretical and
empirical foundations for position-aware analysis in RAG, highlighting the need
for evidence reordering or debiasing strategies to build more reliable and
equitable generation systems.

### [3] [Smotrom tvoja pa ander drogoj verden! Resurrecting Dead Pidgin with Generative Models: Russenorsk Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11065)
*Alexey Tikhonov,Sergei Shteiner,Anna Bykova,Ivan P. Yamshchikov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文利用现代大语言模型分析历史贸易语言Russenorsk的词汇，构建结构化词典，验证其构词和语法假设，并开发翻译工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Russenorsk这一独特的贸易语言，探索其词汇和语法结构，填补学术空白。

Method: 基于现存文献，使用大语言模型构建词典，验证假设，并开发翻译工具。

Result: 验证了部分学术假设，并开发了能生成Russenorsk文本的翻译工具。

Conclusion: 大语言模型为历史语言研究提供了新工具，Russenorsk的构词和语法结构值得进一步研究。

Abstract: Russenorsk, a pidgin language historically used in trade interactions between
Russian and Norwegian speakers, represents a unique linguistic phenomenon. In
this paper, we attempt to analyze its lexicon using modern large language
models (LLMs), based on surviving literary sources. We construct a structured
dictionary of the language, grouped by synonyms and word origins. Subsequently,
we use this dictionary to formulate hypotheses about the core principles of
word formation and grammatical structure in Russenorsk and show which
hypotheses generated by large language models correspond to the hypotheses
previously proposed ones in the academic literature. We also develop a
"reconstruction" translation agent that generates hypothetical Russenorsk
renderings of contemporary Russian and Norwegian texts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的自动化流程，用于从临床笔记中提取系统回顾（ROS）实体，结合开源和商业模型，实现低成本高效执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减轻临床文档负担，提供可扩展且本地部署的解决方案，适用于资源有限的医疗环境。

Method: 使用SecTag提取ROS部分，结合少量样本的LLM识别实体范围、状态及关联系统，测试了开源（Mistral、Llama、Gemma）和商业（ChatGPT）模型。

Result: ChatGPT表现最佳（实体范围错误率28.2%，状态/系统错误率14.5%），开源模型表现接近（实体范围错误率30.5-36.7%，状态/系统错误率24.3-27.3%）。

Conclusion: 该流程具有可扩展性和本地部署优势，开源模型在资源有限环境中是商业模型的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Objective: Develop a cost-effective, large language model (LLM)-based
pipeline for automatically extracting Review of Systems (ROS) entities from
clinical notes. Materials and Methods: The pipeline extracts ROS sections using
SecTag, followed by few-shot LLMs to identify ROS entity spans, their
positive/negative status, and associated body systems. We implemented the
pipeline using open-source LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma) and ChatGPT. The
evaluation was conducted on 36 general medicine notes containing 341 annotated
ROS entities. Results: When integrating ChatGPT, the pipeline achieved the
lowest error rates in detecting ROS entity spans and their corresponding
statuses/systems (28.2% and 14.5%, respectively). Open-source LLMs enable
local, cost-efficient execution of the pipeline while delivering promising
performance with similarly low error rates (span: 30.5-36.7%; status/system:
24.3-27.3%). Discussion and Conclusion: Our pipeline offers a scalable and
locally deployable solution to reduce ROS documentation burden. Open-source
LLMs present a viable alternative to commercial models in resource-limited
healthcare environments.

### [5] [Deontological Keyword Bias: The Impact of Modal Expressions on Normative Judgments of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11068)
*Bumjin Park,Jinsil Lee,Jaesik Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在道德推理中表现出对义务判断的偏见（DKB），即模态表达（如“必须”或“应当”）会使其将非义务场景误判为义务。通过结合少量示例和推理提示，可缓解此偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在义务判断中的偏见，揭示模态表达对其决策的影响，以提升模型的对齐性。

Method: 分析LLMs在不同模态表达下的义务判断，提出结合少量示例和推理提示的缓解策略。

Result: LLMs在模态表达下将90%以上的常识场景误判为义务，且跨模型、问题类型和答案格式一致。

Conclusion: 模态表达会显著影响LLMs的义务判断，需通过策略缓解偏见以确保判断对齐。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly engaging in moral and ethical
reasoning, where criteria for judgment are often unclear, even for humans.
While LLM alignment studies cover many areas, one important yet underexplored
area is how LLMs make judgments about obligations. This work reveals a strong
tendency in LLMs to judge non-obligatory contexts as obligations when prompts
are augmented with modal expressions such as must or ought to. We introduce
this phenomenon as Deontological Keyword Bias (DKB). We find that LLMs judge
over 90\% of commonsense scenarios as obligations when modal expressions are
present. This tendency is consist across various LLM families, question types,
and answer formats. To mitigate DKB, we propose a judgment strategy that
integrates few-shot examples with reasoning prompts. This study sheds light on
how modal expressions, as a form of linguistic framing, influence the normative
decisions of LLMs and underscores the importance of addressing such biases to
ensure judgment alignment.

### [6] [Targeted control of fast prototyping through domain-specific interface](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11070)
*Yu-Zhe Shi,Mingchen Liu,Hanlu Ma,Qiao Xu,Huamin Qu,Kun He,Lecheng Ruan,Qining Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种接口架构，通过自然语言指令实现原型模型的精准控制，弥补设计师语言与建模语言之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业设计师希望通过自然语言指令直观控制原型模型，但现有大型语言模型在此领域的潜力未充分利用，主要因语言抽象层次、语义精度和词汇范围的不匹配。

Method: 基于快速原型设计实践的系统研究，设计接口架构及其操作机制，并开发自动化领域规范算法。

Result: 机器评估和人类研究显示，该接口可作为大型语言模型的辅助模块，实现原型模型的精准有效控制。

Conclusion: 该接口架构成功弥补了设计师语言与建模语言之间的差距，提升了原型模型控制的自然性和精确性。

Abstract: Industrial designers have long sought a natural and intuitive way to achieve
the targeted control of prototype models -- using simple natural language
instructions to configure and adjust the models seamlessly according to their
intentions, without relying on complex modeling commands. While Large Language
Models have shown promise in this area, their potential for controlling
prototype models through language remains partially underutilized. This
limitation stems from gaps between designers' languages and modeling languages,
including mismatch in abstraction levels, fluctuation in semantic precision,
and divergence in lexical scopes. To bridge these gaps, we propose an interface
architecture that serves as a medium between the two languages. Grounded in
design principles derived from a systematic investigation of fast prototyping
practices, we devise the interface's operational mechanism and develop an
algorithm for its automated domain specification. Both machine-based
evaluations and human studies on fast prototyping across various product design
domains demonstrate the interface's potential to function as an auxiliary
module for Large Language Models, enabling precise and effective targeted
control of prototype models.

### [7] [CLAIM: Mitigating Multilingual Object Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models with Cross-Lingual Attention Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11073)
*Zekai Ye,Qiming Li,Xiaocheng Feng,Libo Qin,Yichong Huang,Baohang Li,Kui Jiang,Yang Xiang,Zhirui Zhang,Yunfei Lu,Duyu Tang,Dandan Tu,Bing Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLAIM提出了一种无需训练的跨语言注意力干预方法，用于减少大型视觉语言模型中的多语言对象幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预训练或微调，资源消耗大，而CLAIM通过注意力对齐实现高效干预。

Method: CLAIM识别语言特定的跨模态注意力头，估计语言偏移向量，并在推理时干预注意力输出。

Result: 实验显示CLAIM在POPE和MME基准上平均提升13.56%和21.75%，西班牙语最高提升30%。

Conclusion: CLAIM有效减少了多语言对象幻觉，中间层注意力差异在多语言场景中尤为关键。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal
abilities but remain prone to multilingual object hallucination, with a higher
likelihood of generating responses inconsistent with the visual input when
utilizing queries in non-English languages compared to English. Most existing
approaches to address these rely on pretraining or fine-tuning, which are
resource-intensive. In this paper, inspired by observing the disparities in
cross-modal attention patterns across languages, we propose Cross-Lingual
Attention Intervention for Mitigating multilingual object hallucination (CLAIM)
in LVLMs, a novel near training-free method by aligning attention patterns.
CLAIM first identifies language-specific cross-modal attention heads, then
estimates language shift vectors from English to the target language, and
finally intervenes in the attention outputs during inference to facilitate
cross-lingual visual perception capability alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CLAIM achieves an average improvement of 13.56% (up to 30% in
Spanish) on the POPE and 21.75% on the hallucination subsets of the MME
benchmark across various languages. Further analysis reveals that multilingual
attention divergence is most prominent in intermediate layers, highlighting
their critical role in multilingual scenarios.

*Chongyu Fan,Yihua Zhang,Jinghan Jia,Alfred Hero,Sijia Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态调节反思令牌（reflection tokens）使用的方法CyclicReflex，通过周期性调整令牌的分配，优化大型推理模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反思令牌在推理过程中起到关键作用，但过多或过少使用都会影响模型性能。如何合理分配这一资源成为研究重点。

Method: 提出CyclicReflex方法，通过位置相关的三角波形动态调整反思令牌的logits，实现周期性调度。

Result: 在多个数据集（MATH500、AIME2024/2025、AMC2023）上验证，CyclicReflex显著提升了不同规模模型（1.5B-8B）的性能。

Conclusion: CyclicReflex是一种有效的解码策略，能够平衡反思令牌的使用，提升模型推理能力。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, harness
test-time scaling to perform multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving.
This reasoning process, executed before producing final answers, is often
guided by special juncture tokens or textual segments that prompt
self-evaluative reflection. We refer to these transition markers and reflective
cues as "reflection tokens" (e.g., "wait", "but", "alternatively"). In this
work, we treat reflection tokens as a "resource" and introduce the problem of
resource allocation, aimed at improving the test-time compute performance of
LRMs by adaptively regulating the frequency and placement of reflection tokens.
Through empirical analysis, we show that both excessive and insufficient use of
reflection tokens, referred to as over-reflection and under-reflection, can
degrade model performance. To better understand and manage this trade-off, we
draw an analogy between reflection token usage and learning rate scheduling in
optimization. Building on this insight, we propose cyclical reflection token
scheduling (termed CyclicReflex), a decoding strategy that dynamically
modulates reflection token logits using a position-dependent triangular
waveform. Experiments on MATH500, AIME2024/2025, and AMC2023 demonstrate that
CyclicReflex consistently improves performance across model sizes (1.5B-8B),
outperforming standard decoding and more recent approaches such as TIP (thought
switching penalty) and S1. Codes are available at

### [9] [RoE-FND: A Case-Based Reasoning Approach with Dual Verification for Fake News Detection via LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11078)
*Yuzhou Yang,Yangming Zhou,Zhiying Zhu,Zhenxing Qian,Xinpeng Zhang,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RoE-FND是一个基于逻辑推理的假新闻检测框架，结合LLMs与经验学习，通过自反性知识构建和动态准则检索提升检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有假新闻检测方法存在证据选择噪声、泛化瓶颈和决策不透明等问题，LLMs的引入又带来幻觉推理和结论偏差的新挑战。

Method: RoE-FND分为两阶段：自反性知识构建（分析历史推理错误）和动态准则检索（从历史案例中提取推理准则），并通过双通道程序交叉验证。

Result: 实验证明RoE-FND在三个数据集上优于现有方法，具有更好的泛化能力和有效性。

Conclusion: RoE-FND通过逻辑推理和经验学习解决了假新闻检测中的多个挑战，且无需训练即可适应动态环境。

Abstract: The proliferation of deceptive content online necessitates robust Fake News
Detection (FND) systems. While evidence-based approaches leverage external
knowledge to verify claims, existing methods face critical limitations: noisy
evidence selection, generalization bottlenecks, and unclear decision-making
processes. Recent efforts to harness Large Language Models (LLMs) for FND
introduce new challenges, including hallucinated rationales and conclusion
bias. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{RoE-FND}
(\textbf{\underline{R}}eason \textbf{\underline{o}}n
\textbf{\underline{E}}xperiences FND), a framework that reframes evidence-based
FND as a logical deduction task by synergizing LLMs with experiential learning.
RoE-FND encompasses two stages: (1) \textit{self-reflective knowledge
building}, where a knowledge base is curated by analyzing past reasoning
errors, namely the exploration stage, and (2) \textit{dynamic criterion
retrieval}, which synthesizes task-specific reasoning guidelines from
historical cases as experiences during deployment. It further cross-checks
rationales against internal experience through a devised dual-channel
procedure. Key contributions include: a case-based reasoning framework for FND
that addresses multiple existing challenges, a training-free approach enabling
adaptation to evolving situations, and empirical validation of the framework's
superior generalization and effectiveness over state-of-the-art methods across
three datasets.

### [10] [MANBench: Is Your Multimodal Model Smarter than Human?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11080)
*Han Zhou,Qitong Xu,Yiheng Dong,Xin Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MANBench是一个双语基准测试（英语和中文），用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在多种任务中的表现，发现MLLMs在某些任务上表现优异，但在复杂推理任务上仍落后于人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型的快速发展，需要一种严格的评估框架来衡量其与人类在多模态任务中的差距。

Method: MANBench包含1,314个问题，覆盖九类任务，通过人类实验与MLLMs的表现进行对比。

Result: MLLMs在知识和文本-图像理解任务上表现优异，但在跨模态推理任务（如Transmorphic理解）和复杂任务（如拼图和空间想象）上表现不佳。

Conclusion: MANBench揭示了MLLMs的局限性，并希望推动缩小MLLMs与人类多模态能力差距的研究。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has ignited
discussions regarding their potential to surpass human performance in
multimodal tasks. In response, we introduce MANBench (Multimodal Ability Norms
Benchmark), a bilingual benchmark (English and Chinese) comprising 1,314
questions across nine tasks, spanning knowledge-based and non-knowledge-based
domains. MANBench emphasizes intuitive reasoning, seamless cross-modal
integration, and real-world complexity, providing a rigorous evaluation
framework.
  Through extensive human experiments involving diverse participants, we
compared human performance against state-of-the-art MLLMs. The results indicate
that while MLLMs excel in tasks like Knowledge and Text-Image Understanding,
they struggle with deeper cross-modal reasoning tasks such as Transmorphic
Understanding, Image Consistency, and Multi-image Understanding. Moreover, both
humans and MLLMs face challenges in highly complex tasks like Puzzles and
Spatial Imagination.
  MANBench highlights the strengths and limitations of MLLMs, revealing that
even advanced models fall short of achieving human-level performance across
many domains. We hope MANBench will inspire efforts to bridge the gap between
MLLMs and human multimodal capabilities. The code and dataset are available at
https://github.com/micdz/MANBench.

*Aditi,Hyunwoo Park,Sicheol Sung,Yo-Sub Han,Sang-Ki Ko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于开源大语言模型（LLM）的方法SAGE，用于从自然语言规范中生成上下文无关计数器文法（CCFG），并通过强化学习优化文法有效性。实验表明，SAGE在文法质量和测试效果上优于17种开源和闭源LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从自然语言规范生成有效且通用的文法仍是一个关键挑战，尤其是在有限监督下。

Method: 结合开源LLM进行规范到文法的翻译，并使用GRPO强化学习优化文法有效性和通用性。

Result: SAGE在文法有效性上提升15.92%，测试效果提升12.34%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAGE展示了LLM在文法生成中的潜力，并通过强化学习进一步优化效果。

Abstract: Grammar-based test case generation has proven effective for competitive
programming problems, but generating valid and general grammars from natural
language specifications remains a key challenge, especially under limited
supervision. Context-Free Grammars with Counters (CCFGs) have recently been
introduced as a formalism to represent such specifications with logical
constraints by storing and reusing counter values during derivation. In this
work, we explore the use of open-source large language models (LLMs) to induce
CCFGs from specifications using a small number of labeled examples and
verifiable reward-guided reinforcement learning. Our approach first fine-tunes
an open-source LLM to perform specification-to-grammar translation, and further
applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance grammar validity
and generality. We also examine the effectiveness of iterative feedback for
open and closed-source LLMs in correcting syntactic and semantic errors in
generated grammars.
  Experimental results show that our approach SAGE achieves stronger
generalization and outperforms 17 open and closed-source LLMs in both grammar
quality and test effectiveness, improving over the state-of-the-art by 15.92%p
in grammar validity and 12.34%p in test effectiveness. We provide our
implementation and dataset at the following anonymous

*Lionel Levine,John Santerre,Alex S. Young,T. Barry Levine,Francis Campion,Majid Sarrafzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRISM是一种基于Transformer的架构，用于建模临床决策过程的序列进展，通过学习预测患者诊断旅程中的下一步，显著优于随机基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖孤立的诊断分类，无法捕捉临床轨迹的复杂依赖关系，PRISM旨在填补这一空白。

Method: PRISM将临床轨迹标记化为事件序列（如诊断测试、实验室结果），采用自回归训练目标和大规模临床词汇表。

Result: 实验显示PRISM在预测任务中表现优异，生成的序列反映了真实的诊断路径和临床行为。

Conclusion: PRISM为序列化医疗建模奠定了基础，展示了生成式语言模型在结构化医疗数据中的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce PRISM (Predictive Reasoning in Sequential Medicine), a
transformer-based architecture designed to model the sequential progression of
clinical decision-making processes. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on
isolated diagnostic classification, PRISM frames clinical trajectories as
tokenized sequences of events - including diagnostic tests, laboratory results,
and diagnoses - and learns to predict the most probable next steps in the
patient diagnostic journey. Leveraging a large custom clinical vocabulary and
an autoregressive training objective, PRISM demonstrates the ability to capture
complex dependencies across longitudinal patient timelines. Experimental
results show substantial improvements over random baselines in next-token
prediction tasks, with generated sequences reflecting realistic diagnostic
pathways, laboratory result progressions, and clinician ordering behaviors.
These findings highlight the feasibility of applying generative language
modeling techniques to structured medical event data, enabling applications in
clinical decision support, simulation, and education. PRISM establishes a
foundation for future advancements in sequence-based healthcare modeling,
bridging the gap between machine learning architectures and real-world
diagnostic reasoning.

*Ali Asad,Stephen Obadinma,Radin Shayanfar,Xiaodan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RedDebate是一个多智能体辩论框架，通过LLM之间的对抗性论证自动识别和减少不安全行为，结合长期记忆模块提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI安全方法依赖人工评估或单模型评估，存在扩展性和监督风险。RedDebate通过多智能体辩论和自动化红队测试解决这些问题。

Method: 利用多LLM之间的对抗性辩论和长期记忆模块，系统性发现和改进不安全行为。

Result: 在HarmBench基准测试中，辩论减少17.7%不安全行为，结合记忆模块后减少超过23.5%。

Conclusion: RedDebate是首个结合多智能体辩论和红队测试的全自动AI安全提升框架。

Abstract: We propose RedDebate, a novel multi-agent debate framework that leverages
adversarial argumentation among Large Language Models (LLMs) to proactively
identify and mitigate their own unsafe behaviours. Existing AI safety methods
often depend heavily on costly human evaluations or isolated single-model
assessment, both subject to scalability constraints and oversight risks.
RedDebate instead embraces collaborative disagreement, enabling multiple LLMs
to critically examine one another's reasoning, and systematically uncovering
unsafe blind spots through automated red-teaming, and iteratively improve their
responses. We further integrate distinct types of long-term memory that retain
learned safety insights from debate interactions. Evaluating on established
safety benchmarks such as HarmBench, we demonstrate the proposed method's
effectiveness. Debate alone can reduce unsafe behaviours by 17.7%, and when
combined with long-term memory modules, achieves reductions exceeding 23.5%. To
our knowledge, RedDebate constitutes the first fully automated framework that
combines multi-agent debates with red-teaming to progressively enhance AI
safety without direct human intervention.(Github Repository:

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in natural language
processing, yet their practical deployment remains hindered by persistent
factuality and faithfulness hallucinations. While existing methods address
these hallucination types independently, they inadvertently induce performance
trade-offs, as interventions targeting one type often exacerbate the other.
Through empirical and theoretical analysis of activation space dynamics in
LLMs, we reveal that these hallucination categories share overlapping subspaces
within neural representations, presenting an opportunity for concurrent
mitigation. To harness this insight, we propose SPACE, a unified framework that
jointly enhances factuality and faithfulness by editing shared activation
subspaces. SPACE establishes a geometric foundation for shared subspace
existence through dual-task feature modeling, then identifies and edits these
subspaces via a hybrid probe strategy combining spectral clustering and
attention head saliency scoring. Experimental results across multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的无监督领域适应方法，利用LLM反馈提升ASR模型在命名实体识别上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR系统在通用转录任务中表现良好，但在识别罕见命名实体和适应领域不匹配时仍有困难。LLM因其大规模训练数据在多领域表现更优。

Method: 使用LLM作为奖励模型，为ASR模型的假设打分，通过强化学习微调ASR模型。

Result: 在实体词错误率上比传统自训练方法提升了21%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了ASR模型在领域适应和命名实体识别上的性能。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved strong performance
on general transcription tasks. However, they continue to struggle with
recognizing rare named entities and adapting to domain mismatches. In contrast,
large language models (LLMs), trained on massive internet-scale datasets, are
often more effective across a wide range of domains. In this work, we propose a
reinforcement learning based approach for unsupervised domain adaptation,
leveraging unlabeled data to enhance transcription quality, particularly the
named entities affected by domain mismatch, through feedback from a LLM. Given
contextual information, our framework employs a LLM as the reward model to
score the hypotheses from the ASR model. These scores serve as reward signals
to fine-tune the ASR model via reinforcement learning. Our method achieves a
21\% improvement on entity word error rate over conventional self-training
methods.

*Jubin Abhishek Soni,Amit Anand,Rajesh Kumar Pandey,Aniket Abhishek Soni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DCT框架扩展了RAG，支持多轮对话和动态工具环境，无需重新训练，显著提升性能并降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统在动态领域（如医疗和智能家居）中表现不佳，因其静态、单轮交互和固定工具集的限制。

Method: DCT通过注意力缓存、LoRA检索和上下文压缩，动态跟踪信息、选择工具并保持输入在LLM限制内。

Result: 实验显示DCT提升计划准确性14%，减少幻觉37%，性能接近GPT-4但成本更低，并能泛化到新工具。

Conclusion: DCT为动态环境提供了可扩展、适应性强的AI助手解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly advanced large
language models (LLMs) by grounding their outputs in external tools and
knowledge sources. However, existing RAG systems are typically constrained to
static, single-turn interactions with fixed toolsets, making them ill-suited
for dynamic domains such as healthcare and smart homes, where user intent,
available tools, and contextual factors evolve over time. We present Dynamic
Context Tuning (DCT), a lightweight framework that extends RAG to support
multi-turn dialogue and evolving tool environments without requiring
retraining. DCT integrates an attention-based context cache to track relevant
past information, LoRA-based retrieval to dynamically select domain-specific
tools, and efficient context compression to maintain inputs within LLM context
limits. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that DCT
improves plan accuracy by 14% and reduces hallucinations by 37%, while matching
GPT-4 performance at significantly lower cost. Furthermore, DCT generalizes to
previously unseen tools, enabling scalable and adaptable AI assistants across a
wide range of dynamic environments.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in the field of
Natural Language Processing (NLP), including areas such as content generation,
human-computer interaction, machine translation, and code generation, among
others. However, their widespread deployment has also raised significant safety
concerns. In recent years, LLM-generated content has occasionally exhibited
unsafe elements like toxicity and bias, particularly in adversarial scenarios,
which has garnered extensive attention from both academia and industry. While
numerous efforts have been made to evaluate the safety risks associated with
LLMs, there remains a lack of systematic reviews summarizing these research
endeavors. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic overview
of recent advancements in LLMs safety evaluation, focusing on several key
aspects: (1) "Why evaluate" that explores the background of LLMs safety
evaluation, how they differ from general LLMs evaluation, and the significance
of such evaluation; (2) "What to evaluate" that examines and categorizes
existing safety evaluation tasks based on key capabilities, including
dimensions such as toxicity, robustness, ethics, bias and fairness,
truthfulness, and so on; (3) "Where to evaluate" that summarizes the evaluation
metrics, datasets and benchmarks currently used in safety evaluations; (4) "How
to evaluate" that reviews existing evaluation toolkit, and categorizing
mainstream evaluation methods based on the roles of the evaluators. Finally, we
identify the challenges in LLMs safety evaluation and propose potential
research directions to promote further advancement in this field. We emphasize
the importance of prioritizing LLMs safety evaluation to ensure the safe
deployment of these models in real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 读者好奇心对文本参与度至关重要，但在NLP领域尚未充分研究。本文旨在填补这一空白，通过信息缺口理论建模好奇心。

Method: 结合BERTopic主题建模和持久同调分析，构建动态语义网络的拓扑特征（如连通分量、循环、空洞），作为信息缺口的代理。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法显著提升了好奇心预测的准确性（解释偏差从30%提升至73%）。

Conclusion: 该框架为分析文本结构与读者参与度的关系提供了一种新的计算方法，验证了信息缺口理论在NLP中的实用性。

Abstract: Reader curiosity, the drive to seek information, is crucial for textual
engagement, yet remains relatively underexplored in NLP. Building on
Loewenstein's Information Gap Theory, we introduce a framework that models
reader curiosity by quantifying semantic information gaps within a text's
semantic structure. Our approach leverages BERTopic-inspired topic modeling and
persistent homology to analyze the evolving topology (connected components,
cycles, voids) of a dynamic semantic network derived from text segments,
treating these features as proxies for information gaps. To empirically
evaluate this pipeline, we collect reader curiosity ratings from participants
(n = 49) as they read S. Collins's ''The Hunger Games'' novel. We then use the
topological features from our pipeline as independent variables to predict
these ratings, and experimentally show that they significantly improve
curiosity prediction compared to a baseline model (73% vs. 30% explained
deviance), validating our approach. This pipeline offers a new computational
method for analyzing text structure and its relation to reader engagement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究C-SEO方法的广泛适用性和多参与者竞争场景下的效果，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 设计C-SEO Bench基准，涵盖问答和产品推荐两种任务，每个任务三个领域，并制定新的评估协议。

Result: 当前C-SEO方法效果不佳，传统SEO策略更有效；多参与者竞争导致整体收益下降。

Conclusion: C-SEO问题具有拥堵性和零和性，传统SEO策略在LLM环境下仍占优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming search engines into
Conversational Search Engines (CSE). Consequently, Search Engine Optimization
(SEO) is being shifted into Conversational Search Engine Optimization (C-SEO).
We are beginning to see dedicated C-SEO methods for modifying web documents to
increase their visibility in CSE responses. However, they are often tested only
for a limited breadth of application domains; we do not understand whether
certain C-SEO methods would be effective for a broad range of domains.
Moreover, existing evaluations consider only a single-actor scenario where only
one web document adopts a C-SEO method; in reality, multiple players are likely
to competitively adopt the cutting-edge C-SEO techniques, drawing an analogy
from the dynamics we have seen in SEO. We present C-SEO Bench, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate C-SEO methods across multiple tasks, domains,
and number of actors. We consider two search tasks, question answering and
product recommendation, with three domains each. We also formalize a new
evaluation protocol with varying adoption rates among involved actors. Our
experiments reveal that most current C-SEO methods are largely ineffective,
contrary to reported results in the literature. Instead, traditional SEO
strategies, those aiming to improve the ranking of the source in the LLM
context, are significantly more effective. We also observe that as we increase
the number of C-SEO adopters, the overall gains decrease, depicting a congested
and zero-sum nature of the problem. Our code and data are available at

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT, Gemini, and
DeepSeek, has significantly advanced natural language processing, giving rise
to sophisticated chatbots capable of diverse language-related tasks. The
transition from these traditional LLM chatbots to more advanced AI agents
represents a pivotal evolutionary step. However, existing evaluation frameworks
often blur the distinctions between LLM chatbots and AI agents, leading to
confusion among researchers selecting appropriate benchmarks. To bridge this
gap, this paper introduces a systematic analysis of current evaluation
approaches, grounded in an evolutionary perspective. We provide a detailed
analytical framework that clearly differentiates AI agents from LLM chatbots
along five key aspects: complex environment, multi-source instructor, dynamic
feedback, multi-modal perception, and advanced capability. Further, we
categorize existing evaluation benchmarks based on external environments
driving forces, and resulting advanced internal capabilities. For each
category, we delineate relevant evaluation attributes, presented
comprehensively in practical reference tables. Finally, we synthesize current
trends and outline future evaluation methodologies through four critical
lenses: environment, agent, evaluator, and metrics. Our findings offer
actionable guidance for researchers, facilitating the informed selection and
application of benchmarks in AI agent evaluation, thus fostering continued
advancement in this rapidly evolving research domain.

*Wenchong He,Liqian Peng,Zhe Jiang,Alex Go*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Many-Shot In-Context Fine-tuning (ManyICL) 是一种新方法，通过将上下文学习扩展到多样本设置，显著缩小了与专用微调的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的中等规模LLMs通过少量样本上下文微调可以实现多任务处理，但仍落后于专用微调。ManyICL旨在解决这一性能差距。

Method: 提出ManyICL，通过将上下文中的每个答案作为监督训练目标，将多样本示例从提示转变为自回归学习的目标。

Result: ManyICL在分类、摘要、问答等任务上显著优于零/少量样本微调，接近专用微调性能，并缓解了灾难性遗忘问题。

Conclusion: ManyICL是一种高效的多任务处理方法，性能接近专用微调，且代码将公开。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess a remarkable ability to perform
in-context learning (ICL), which enables them to handle multiple downstream
tasks simultaneously without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Recent
studies have shown that even moderately sized LLMs, such as Mistral 7B, Gemma
7B and Llama-3 8B, can achieve ICL through few-shot in-context fine-tuning of
all tasks at once. However, this approach still lags behind dedicated
fine-tuning, where a separate model is trained for each individual task.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Many-Shot In-Context Fine-tuning
(ManyICL), which significantly narrows this performance gap by extending the
principles of ICL to a many-shot setting. To unlock the full potential of
ManyICL and address the inherent inefficiency of processing long sequences with
numerous in-context examples, we propose a novel training objective. Instead of
solely predicting the final answer, our approach treats every answer within the
context as a supervised training target. This effectively shifts the role of
many-shot examples from prompts to targets for autoregressive learning. Through
extensive experiments on diverse downstream tasks, including classification,
summarization, question answering, natural language inference, and math, we
demonstrate that ManyICL substantially outperforms zero/few-shot fine-tuning
and approaches the performance of dedicated fine-tuning. Furthermore, ManyICL
significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting issues observed in
zero/few-shot fine-tuning. The code will be made publicly available upon
publication.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态稀疏注意力机制（DAM），通过自适应掩码解决传统稀疏注意力方法中静态掩码的局限性，提升长序列任务中的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏注意力方法使用静态预定义掩码，无法捕捉异构注意力模式，导致子优的令牌交互和检索精度问题。

Method: 引入动态稀疏注意力机制，在注意力图级别分配自适应掩码，保留各层和头的异构模式，无需微调或预定义掩码结构。

Result: 该方法在保持计算效率的同时，与全注意力模型高度对齐，显著减少内存和计算开销，且性能损失最小。

Conclusion: DAM为大规模语言模型提供了一种可扩展的替代方案，无需牺牲检索性能即可实现实际部署。

Abstract: Long-context understanding is crucial for many NLP applications, yet
transformers struggle with efficiency due to the quadratic complexity of
self-attention. Sparse attention methods alleviate this cost but often impose
static, predefined masks, failing to capture heterogeneous attention patterns.
This results in suboptimal token interactions, limiting adaptability and
retrieval accuracy in long-sequence tasks. This work introduces a dynamic
sparse attention mechanism that assigns adaptive masks at the attention-map
level, preserving heterogeneous patterns across layers and heads. Unlike
existing approaches, our method eliminates the need for fine-tuning and
predefined mask structures while maintaining computational efficiency. By
learning context-aware attention structures, it achieves high alignment with
full-attention models, ensuring minimal performance degradation while reducing
memory and compute overhead. This approach provides a scalable alternative to
full attention, enabling the practical deployment of large-scale Large Language
Models (LLMs) without sacrificing retrieval performance. DAM is available at:

<details>

Motivation: LLMs在医疗领域潜力巨大，但体积过大难以在资源受限的边缘设备上部署，因此需要一种高效的压缩方法。

Method: 通过测量神经元显著性进行剪枝，并结合后训练量化技术，优化模型体积和性能。

Result: 压缩后的Gemma和LLaMA3模型在Jetson Orin Nano和Raspberry Pi 5上实现实时推理，性能损失可控。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLMs在资源受限环境中的部署提供了可行方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significant impact on the healthcare
scenarios but remain prohibitively large for deployment in real-time,
resource-constrained environments such as edge devices. In this work, we
introduce a novel medical assistant system, optimized through our
general-purpose compression framework, which tailors Large Language Models
(LLMs) for deployment in specialized domains. By measuring neuron saliency on
domain-specific data, our method can aggressively prune irrelevant neurons,
reducing model size while preserving performance. Following pruning, we apply
post-training quantization to further reduce the memory footprint, and evaluate
the compressed model across medical benchmarks including MedMCQA, MedQA, and
PubMedQA. We also deploy the 50\% compressed Gemma and the 67\% compressed
LLaMA3 models on Jetson Orin Nano (18.7W peak) and Raspberry Pi 5 (6.3W peak),
achieving real-time, energy-efficient inference under hardware constraints.

TL;DR: PankRAG框架通过分层查询解析和依赖感知重排机制，解决了传统基于实体的RAG方法可能遗漏关键信息的问题，显著提升了生成响应的准确性和相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于实体的RAG方法可能误解或遗漏潜在关键信息和关系，导致检索内容不相关或矛盾，增加幻觉风险。

Method: PankRAG采用全局感知的分层查询解析策略和依赖感知重排机制，构建多级解析路径并利用依赖结构优化检索结果。

Result: PankRAG在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，展示了其鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PankRAG通过结构化推理和依赖感知优化，显著提升了RAG系统的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Contemporary graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods
typically begin by extracting entities from user queries and then leverage
pre-constructed knowledge graphs to retrieve related relationships and
metadata. However, this pipeline's exclusive reliance on entity-level
extraction can lead to the misinterpretation or omission of latent yet critical
information and relations. As a result, retrieved content may be irrelevant or
contradictory, and essential knowledge may be excluded, exacerbating
hallucination risks and degrading the fidelity of generated responses. To
address these limitations, we introduce PankRAG, a framework that combines a
globally aware, hierarchical query-resolution strategy with a novel
dependency-aware reranking mechanism. PankRAG first constructs a multi-level
resolution path that captures both parallel and sequential interdependencies
within a query, guiding large language models (LLMs) through structured
reasoning. It then applies its dependency-aware reranker to exploit the
dependency structure among resolved sub-questions, enriching and validating
retrieval results for subsequent sub-questions. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that PankRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
across multiple benchmarks, underscoring its robustness and generalizability.

Abstract: We present CAGSR-vLLM-MTC, an extension of our Self-Supervised
Cross-Attention-Guided Reinforcement (CAGSR) framework, now implemented on the
high-performance vLLM runtime, to address both multi-turn dialogue and
chain-of-thought reasoning. Building upon our original single-turn approach, we
first instrumented vLLM's C++/CUDA kernels to asynchronously capture per-layer,
per-head cross-attention weights during generation. We then generalized our
self-supervised reward function to accumulate attention signals over entire
conversation histories and intermediate chain-of-thought steps. We discuss
practical trade-offs, including an entropy-based clamping mechanism to prevent
attention collapse on early context, and outline future directions for
multi-party dialogues and hierarchical reasoning.

Method: QT-Mob引入位置标记化模块学习语义丰富的紧凑标记，并结合多目标微调优化LLMs对移动数据的理解。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，QT-Mob在下一位置预测和移动恢复任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: QT-Mob不仅提升了LLMs对移动数据的解释能力，还为移动分析任务提供了更通用的解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of location-based services has led to the generation
of vast amounts of mobility data, providing significant opportunities to model
user movement dynamics within urban environments. Recent advancements have
focused on adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for mobility analytics.
However, existing methods face two primary limitations: inadequate semantic
representation of locations (i.e., discrete IDs) and insufficient modeling of
mobility signals within LLMs (i.e., single templated instruction fine-tuning).
To address these issues, we propose QT-Mob, a novel framework that
significantly enhances LLMs for mobility analytics. QT-Mob introduces a
location tokenization module that learns compact, semantically rich tokens to
represent locations, preserving contextual information while ensuring
compatibility with LLMs. Furthermore, QT-Mob incorporates a series of
complementary fine-tuning objectives that align the learned tokens with the
internal representations in LLMs, improving the model's comprehension of
sequential movement patterns and location semantics. The proposed QT-Mob
framework not only enhances LLMs' ability to interpret mobility data but also
provides a more generalizable approach for various mobility analytics tasks.
Experiments on three real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance in
both next-location prediction and mobility recovery tasks, outperforming
existing deep learning and LLM-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在用户对立陈述下是否坚持事实一致性，填补了现有评测的空白。

Method: 从FEVEROUS数据集中采样事实，构建对立提示（用户声称正确或错误），记录模型的同意与推理。

Result: 评测旨在衡量模型在用户对立陈述下是否坚持事实，而非随用户观点摇摆。

Conclusion: AssertBench为评估LLMs在面对用户对立陈述时的坚持性提供了新方法。

Abstract: Recent benchmarks have probed factual consistency and rhetorical robustness
in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a knowledge gap exists regarding how
directional framing of factually true statements influences model agreement, a
common scenario for LLM users. AssertBench addresses this by sampling
evidence-supported facts from FEVEROUS, a fact verification dataset. For each
(evidence-backed) fact, we construct two framing prompts: one where the user
claims the statement is factually correct, and another where the user claims it
is incorrect. We then record the model's agreement and reasoning. The desired
outcome is that the model asserts itself, maintaining consistent truth
evaluation across both framings, rather than switching its evaluation to agree
with the user. AssertBench isolates framing-induced variability from the
model's underlying factual knowledge by stratifying results based on the
model's accuracy on the same claims when presented neutrally. In doing so, this
benchmark aims to measure an LLM's ability to "stick to its guns" when
presented with contradictory user assertions about the same fact. The complete
source code is available at https://github.com/achowd32/assert-bench.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained enormous attention in recent years
due to their capability of understanding and generating natural languages. With
the rapid development and wild-range applications (e.g., Agents, Embodied
Intelligence), the robustness of LLMs has received increased attention. As the
core brain of many AI applications, the robustness of LLMs requires that models
should not only generate consistent contents, but also ensure the correctness
and stability of generated content when dealing with unexpeted application
scenarios (e.g., toxic prompts, limited noise domain data, outof-distribution
(OOD) applications, etc). In this survey paper, we conduct a thorough review of
the robustness of LLMs, aiming to provide a comprehensive terminology of
concepts and methods around this field and facilitate the community.
Specifically, we first give a formal definition of LLM robustness and present
the collection protocol of this survey paper. Then, based on the types of
perturbated inputs, we organize this survey from the following perspectives: 1)
Adversarial Robustness: tackling the problem that prompts are manipulated
intentionally, such as noise prompts, long context, data attack, etc; 2) OOD
Robustness: dealing with the unexpected real-world application scenarios, such
as OOD detection, zero-shot transferring, hallucinations, etc; 3) Evaluation of
Robustness: summarizing the new evaluation datasets, metrics, and tools for
verifying the robustness of LLMs. After reviewing the representative work from
each perspective, we discuss and highlight future opportunities and research
directions in this field. Meanwhile, we also organize related works and provide
an easy-to-search project
(https://github.com/zhangkunzk/Awesome-LLM-Robustness-papers) to support the
community.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）作为自动化审稿人的鲁棒性，特别是在面对文本对抗攻击时的表现，揭示了其脆弱性并提出了潜在解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着学术投稿量的增加，审稿负担加重，LLMs可能提供帮助，但其易受对抗攻击的特性引发了可靠性问题。

Method: 研究聚焦三个问题：LLMs生成审稿的有效性、对抗攻击对LLM审稿可靠性的影响，以及应对挑战的策略。

Result: 评估显示LLMs在对抗攻击下表现脆弱，文本操纵可能扭曲其审稿结果。

Conclusion: 研究强调需解决对抗风险，以确保AI增强而非损害学术交流的完整性。

Abstract: Peer review is essential for maintaining academic quality, but the increasing
volume of submissions places a significant burden on reviewers. Large language
models (LLMs) offer potential assistance in this process, yet their
susceptibility to textual adversarial attacks raises reliability concerns. This
paper investigates the robustness of LLMs used as automated reviewers in the
presence of such attacks. We focus on three key questions: (1) The
effectiveness of LLMs in generating reviews compared to human reviewers. (2)
The impact of adversarial attacks on the reliability of LLM-generated reviews.
(3) Challenges and potential mitigation strategies for LLM-based review. Our
evaluation reveals significant vulnerabilities, as text manipulations can
distort LLM assessments. We offer a comprehensive evaluation of LLM performance
in automated peer reviewing and analyze its robustness against adversarial
attacks. Our findings emphasize the importance of addressing adversarial risks
to ensure AI strengthens, rather than compromises, the integrity of scholarly
communication.

TL;DR: KokushiMD-10是一个多模态基准测试，基于日本十项国家医疗执照考试构建，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在医疗领域的多语言和多模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试多为文本、英语和医学中心，无法全面评估医疗知识和多模态推理能力。

Method: 构建KokushiMD-10基准，包含11588个真实考试问题，涵盖多个医疗领域，结合临床图像和专家注释。

Result: 测试了30多个先进LLMs，包括GPT-4o、Claude 3.5和Gemini，结果显示无模型在所有领域均达标。

Conclusion: KokushiMD-10为评估和推进医疗AI在多语言和多模态任务中的推理能力提供了全面资源。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable
performance in medical licensing exams. However, comprehensive evaluation of
LLMs across various healthcare roles, particularly in high-stakes clinical
scenarios, remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks are typically text-based,
English-centric, and focus primarily on medicines, which limits their ability
to assess broader healthcare knowledge and multimodal reasoning. To address
these gaps, we introduce KokushiMD-10, the first multimodal benchmark
constructed from ten Japanese national healthcare licensing exams. This
benchmark spans multiple fields, including Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing,
Pharmacy, and allied health professions. It contains over 11588 real exam
questions, incorporating clinical images and expert-annotated rationales to
evaluate both textual and visual reasoning. We benchmark over 30
state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and Gemini, across both
text and image-based settings. Despite promising results, no model consistently
meets passing thresholds across domains, highlighting the ongoing challenges in
medical AI. KokushiMD-10 provides a comprehensive and linguistically grounded
resource for evaluating and advancing reasoning-centric medical AI across
multilingual and multimodal clinical tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标记化方法在材料科学中导致过度碎片化和语义丢失，无法保持材料概念的结构和语义完整性。

Method: 提出MATTER方法，结合材料知识库训练的MatDetector和重新排序方法，优先合并材料概念。

Result: MATTER在生成和分类任务中分别平均提升4%和2%的性能。

Conclusion: 领域知识对科学文本处理中的标记化策略至关重要。

Abstract: While language models are increasingly utilized in materials science, typical
models rely on frequency-centric tokenization methods originally developed for
natural language processing. However, these methods frequently produce
excessive fragmentation and semantic loss, failing to maintain the structural
and semantic integrity of material concepts. To address this issue, we propose
MATTER, a novel tokenization approach that integrates material knowledge into
tokenization. Based on MatDetector trained on our materials knowledge base and
a re-ranking method prioritizing material concepts in token merging, MATTER
maintains the structural integrity of identified material concepts and prevents
fragmentation during tokenization, ensuring their semantic meaning remains
intact. The experimental results demonstrate that MATTER outperforms existing
tokenization methods, achieving an average performance gain of $4\%$ and $2\%$
in the generation and classification tasks, respectively. These results
underscore the importance of domain knowledge for tokenization strategies in
scientific text processing. Our code is available at

TL;DR: Infinity-Instruct是一个高质量指令数据集，通过两阶段流程提升LLM的基础和聊天能力，显著超越现有开源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源指令数据集集中在狭窄领域，限制了LLM的泛化能力，与专有模型差距较大。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：第一阶段从1亿样本中筛选出740万高质量基础指令；第二阶段通过选择、进化和诊断过滤合成150万聊天指令。

Result: 在多个开源模型上微调后，性能显著提升，InfInstruct-LLaMA3.1-70B在指令任务上超越GPT-4-0314 8.6%。

Conclusion: Infinity-Instruct展示了基础和聊天训练的协同效应，为LLM开发提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance in real-world
applications, yet existing open-source instruction datasets often concentrate
on narrow domains, such as mathematics or coding, limiting generalization and
widening the gap with proprietary models. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Infinity-Instruct, a high-quality instruction dataset designed to enhance both
foundational and chat capabilities of LLMs through a two-phase pipeline. In
Phase 1, we curate 7.4M high-quality foundational instructions
(InfInstruct-F-7.4M) from over 100M samples using hybrid data selection
techniques. In Phase 2, we synthesize 1.5M high-quality chat instructions
(InfInstruct-G-1.5M) through a two-stage process involving instruction
selection, evolution, and diagnostic filtering. We empirically evaluate
Infinity-Instruct by fine-tuning several open-source models, including Mistral,
LLaMA, Qwen, and Yi, and observe substantial performance gains across both
foundational and instruction following benchmarks, consistently surpassing
official instruction-tuned counterparts. Notably, InfInstruct-LLaMA3.1-70B
outperforms GPT-4-0314 by 8.6\% on instruction following tasks while achieving
comparable foundational performance. These results underscore the synergy
between foundational and chat training and offer new insights into holistic LLM
development. Our

TL;DR: ScIRGen是一个科学QA与检索数据集生成框架，旨在更准确地反映科研人员的信息需求，并生成了61k规模的ScIRGen-Geo数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学检索与QA数据集通常处理简单问题，与真实研究需求不符，因此需要开发更贴合实际需求的工具。

Method: 设计了基于学术论文的数据集信息提取方法，采用认知分类法生成高质量问题，并利用LLM困惑度变化自动筛选答案。

Result: 生成了61k规模的ScIRGen-Geo数据集，并发现现有方法在处理复杂问题时仍存在推理不足的问题。

Conclusion: ScIRGen推动了更复杂工具的开发，以支持科学社区的信息需求。

Abstract: Scientific researchers need intensive information about datasets to
effectively evaluate and develop theories and methodologies. The information
needs regarding datasets are implicitly embedded in particular research tasks,
rather than explicitly expressed in search queries. However, existing
scientific retrieval and question-answering (QA) datasets typically address
straightforward questions, which do not align with the distribution of
real-world research inquiries. To bridge this gap, we developed ScIRGen, a
dataset generation framework for scientific QA \& retrieval that more
accurately reflects the information needs of professional science researchers,
and uses it to create a large-scale scientific retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) dataset with realistic queries, datasets and papers. Technically, we
designed a dataset-oriented information extraction method that leverages
academic papers to augment the dataset representation. We then proposed a
question generation framework by employing cognitive taxonomy to ensure the
quality of synthesized questions. We also design a method to automatically
filter synthetic answers based on the perplexity shift of LLMs, which is highly
aligned with human judgment of answers' validity. Collectively, these
methodologies culminated in the creation of the 61k QA dataset, ScIRGen-Geo. We
benchmarked representative methods on the ScIRGen-Geo dataset for their
question-answering and retrieval capabilities, finding out that current methods
still suffer from reasoning from complex questions. This work advances the
development of more sophisticated tools to support the intricate information
needs of the scientific community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究利用基础模型分析自发语音，用于阿尔茨海默病及相关痴呆（ADRD）的早期检测。结果表明，基于语音和语言模型的分类方法具有潜力，尤其是ASR生成的音频嵌入效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ADRD的早期检测对干预和治疗至关重要，自发语音中的声学和语言标记可作为非侵入性生物标志物。

Method: 使用PREPARE Challenge数据集，筛选703例健康对照、81例轻度认知障碍和405例AD病例，测试多种开源语音和语言模型的分类性能。

Result: Whisper-medium语音模型表现最佳（准确率0.731，AUC 0.802），BERT语言模型结合停顿标注效果次之（准确率0.662，AUC 0.744）。ASR生成的音频嵌入效果优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 研究提出了基于基础模型的ADRD检测框架，声学方法（尤其是ASR嵌入）在可扩展、非侵入性和经济高效的早期检测中表现出潜力。

Abstract: Background: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are progressive
neurodegenerative conditions where early detection is vital for timely
intervention and care. Spontaneous speech contains rich acoustic and linguistic
markers that may serve as non-invasive biomarkers for cognitive decline.
Foundation models, pre-trained on large-scale audio or text data, produce
high-dimensional embeddings encoding contextual and acoustic features.
  Methods: We used the PREPARE Challenge dataset, which includes audio
recordings from over 1,600 participants with three cognitive statuses: healthy
control (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We
excluded non-English, non-spontaneous, or poor-quality recordings. The final
dataset included 703 (59.13%) HC, 81 (6.81%) MCI, and 405 (34.06%) AD cases. We
benchmarked a range of open-source foundation speech and language models to
classify cognitive status into the three categories.
  Results: The Whisper-medium model achieved the highest performance among
speech models (accuracy = 0.731, AUC = 0.802). Among language models, BERT with
pause annotation performed best (accuracy = 0.662, AUC = 0.744). ADRD detection
using state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) model-generated audio
embeddings outperformed others. Including non-semantic features like pause
patterns consistently improved text-based classification.
  Conclusion: This study introduces a benchmarking framework using foundation
models and a clinically relevant dataset. Acoustic-based approaches --
particularly ASR-derived embeddings -- demonstrate strong potential for
scalable, non-invasive, and cost-effective early detection of ADRD.

*Hourun Zhu,Chengchao Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在剪枝阶段引入自蒸馏损失的方法，以更准确地利用原始模型的预测信息，从而优化梯度计算。同时，专注于多层感知机（MLP）模块的剪枝，显著压缩大语言模型（LLM）而不明显降低性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLM）性能强大，但其部署成本高昂。现有基于梯度的剪枝方法因忽略其他词的预测信息，导致生成能力的关键信息丢失。

Method: 在剪枝阶段引入自蒸馏损失，充分利用原始模型的预测信息；专注于MLP模块的剪枝，因其对预测敏感度较低且参数占比高。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在零样本基准测试中显著优于现有剪枝方法，并在1B规模的开放LLM中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自蒸馏损失和MLP模块剪枝，有效压缩LLM且保持性能，为低成本部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: In spite of strong performance achieved by LLMs, the costs of their
deployment are unaffordable. For the compression of LLMs, gradient-based
pruning methods present promising effectiveness. However, in these methods, the
gradient computation with one-hot labels ignore the potential predictions on
other words, thus missing key information for generative capability of the
original model. To address this issue, we introduce a self-distillation loss
during the pruning phase (rather than post-training) to fully exploit the
predictions of the original model, thereby obtaining more accurate gradient
information for pruning. Moreover, we find that, compared to attention modules,
the predictions of LLM are less sensitive to multilayer perceptron (MLP)
modules, which take up more than $5 \times$ parameters (LLaMA3.2-1.2B). To this
end, we focus on the pruning of MLP modules, to significantly compress LLM
without obvious performance degradation. Experimental results on extensive
zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing pruning methods. Furthermore, our method achieves very competitive
performance among 1B-scale open source LLMs. The source code and trained
weights are available at https://github.com/visresearch/SDMPrune.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实领域不匹配导致端到端ASR性能下降，TTA旨在通过推理时调整模型缓解此问题，但现有方法未充分解决TTA与语言模型结合的干扰问题。

Method: 提出SUTA-LM，基于熵最小化的TTA方法，结合语言模型重评分，通过自动步长选择机制控制适应过程。

Result: 在18个多样化ASR数据集上，SUTA-LM表现出跨领域的鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: SUTA-LM有效解决了TTA与语言模型结合的挑战，为跨领域ASR提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Despite progress in end-to-end ASR, real-world domain mismatches still cause
performance drops, which Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate by
adjusting models during inference. Recent work explores combining TTA with
external language models, using techniques like beam search rescoring or
generative error correction. In this work, we identify a previously overlooked
challenge: TTA can interfere with language model rescoring, revealing the
nontrivial nature of effectively combining the two methods. Based on this
insight, we propose SUTA-LM, a simple yet effective extension of SUTA, an
entropy-minimization-based TTA approach, with language model rescoring. SUTA-LM
first applies a controlled adaptation process guided by an auto-step selection
mechanism leveraging both acoustic and linguistic information, followed by
language model rescoring to refine the outputs. Experiments on 18 diverse ASR
datasets show that SUTA-LM achieves robust results across a wide range of
domains.

Motivation: 语音钓鱼攻击利用LLM、TTS和ASR技术，具有高度可扩展性和欺骗性，亟需有效防御手段。

Method: 提出ASRJam框架注入对抗性扰动，并设计EchoGuard利用自然失真（如回声）干扰ASR。

Result: 39人用户研究表明，EchoGuard在ASR干扰和人类通话体验上表现最佳。

Conclusion: EchoGuard是一种高效且实用的防御方案，适用于实时语音钓鱼防护。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), combined with Text-to-Speech (TTS) and
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), are increasingly used to automate voice
phishing (vishing) scams. These systems are scalable and convincing, posing a
significant security threat. We identify the ASR transcription step as the most
vulnerable link in the scam pipeline and introduce ASRJam, a proactive defence
framework that injects adversarial perturbations into the victim's audio to
disrupt the attacker's ASR. This breaks the scam's feedback loop without
affecting human callers, who can still understand the conversation. While prior
adversarial audio techniques are often unpleasant and impractical for real-time
use, we also propose EchoGuard, a novel jammer that leverages natural
distortions, such as reverberation and echo, that are disruptive to ASR but
tolerable to humans. To evaluate EchoGuard's effectiveness and usability, we
conducted a 39-person user study comparing it with three state-of-the-art
attacks. Results show that EchoGuard achieved the highest overall utility,
offering the best combination of ASR disruption and human listening experience.

Abstract: Autonomous agents for Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are revolutionizing
human-computer interaction, yet their reliance on text-based instructions
imposes limitations on accessibility and convenience, particularly in
hands-free scenarios. To address this gap, we propose GUIRoboTron-Speech, the
first end-to-end autonomous GUI agent that directly accepts speech instructions
and on-device screenshots to predict actions. Confronted with the scarcity of
speech-based GUI agent datasets, we initially generated high-quality speech
instructions for training by leveraging a random timbre text-to-speech (TTS)
model to convert existing text instructions. We then develop
GUIRoboTron-Speech's capabilities through progressive grounding and planning
training stages. A key contribution is a heuristic mixed-instruction training
strategy designed to mitigate the modality imbalance inherent in pre-trained
foundation models. Comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets
validate the robust and superior performance of GUIRoboTron-Speech,
demonstrating the significant potential and widespread applicability of speech
as an effective instruction modality for driving GUI agents. Our code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/GUIRoboTron/GUIRoboTron-Speech.

TL;DR: 研究发现，随着语言模型能力的提升，其错误模式逐渐接近人类推理的典型误区，而非完全理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型是否随着能力提升而趋近人类推理模式，尤其是错误模式。

Method: 使用Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR)框架和PyETR工具，评估38个语言模型在383个推理任务中的表现。

Result: 模型能力提升时，错误答案中与人类误区一致的比例增加（ρ=0.360, p=0.0265），但逻辑正确性与模型能力无关。

Conclusion: 语言模型的错误模式趋近人类认知，挑战了模型会自然达到完全理性的观点。

Abstract: Do language models converge toward human-like reasoning patterns as they
improve? We provide surprising evidence that while overall reasoning
capabilities increase with model sophistication, the nature of errors
increasingly mirrors predictable human reasoning fallacies: a previously
unobserved inverse scaling phenomenon. To investigate this question, we apply
the Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR), a formal cognitive framework with
empirical support for predicting human reasoning outcomes. Using the
open-source package PyETR, we generate logical reasoning problems where humans
predictably err, evaluating responses from 38 language models across 383
reasoning tasks. Our analysis indicates that as models advance in general
capability (as measured by Chatbot Arena scores), the proportion of their
incorrect answers that align with ETR-predicted human fallacies tends to
increase ($\rho = 0.360, p = 0.0265$). Notably, as we observe no correlation
between model sophistication and logical correctness on these tasks, this shift
in error patterns toward human-likeness occurs independently of error rate.
These findings challenge the prevailing view that scaling language models
naturally obtains normative rationality, suggesting instead a convergence
toward human-like cognition inclusive of our characteristic biases and
limitations, as we further confirm by demonstrating order-effects in language
model reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in healthcare, but hallucinations
remain a major barrier to clinical use. We present CHECK, a continuous-learning
framework that integrates structured clinical databases with a classifier
grounded in information theory to detect both factual and reasoning-based
hallucinations. Evaluated on 1500 questions from 100 pivotal clinical trials,
CHECK reduced LLama3.3-70B-Instruct hallucination rates from 31% to 0.3% -
making an open source model state of the art. Its classifier generalized across
medical benchmarks, achieving AUCs of 0.95-0.96, including on the MedQA (USMLE)
benchmark and HealthBench realistic multi-turn medical questioning. By
leveraging hallucination probabilities to guide GPT-4o's refinement and
judiciously escalate compute, CHECK boosted its USMLE passing rate by 5
percentage points, achieving a state-of-the-art 92.1%. By suppressing
hallucinations below accepted clinical error thresholds, CHECK offers a
scalable foundation for safe LLM deployment in medicine and other high-stakes
domains.

Motivation: 解决低资源或特定领域ASR性能提升问题，避免依赖大量标注数据。

Method: 利用现有ASR模型生成伪标签，训练TTS系统，合成语音文本对并反馈至ASR系统，形成闭环自优化。

Result: Twister模型在普通话和普通话-英语混合任务上分别降低错误率20%和50%。

Conclusion: 该框架为低资源或领域特定ASR性能提升提供了实用路径，优于传统伪标签自蒸馏方法。

Abstract: We propose a self-refining framework that enhances ASR performance with only
unlabeled datasets. The process starts with an existing ASR model generating
pseudo-labels on unannotated speech, which are then used to train a
high-fidelity text-to-speech (TTS) system. Then, synthesized speech text pairs
are bootstrapped into the original ASR system, completing the closed-loop
self-improvement cycle. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the framework on
Taiwanese Mandarin speech. Leveraging 6,000 hours of unlabeled speech, a
moderate amount of text data, and synthetic content from the AI models, we
adapt Whisper-large-v2 into a specialized model, Twister. Twister reduces error
rates by up to 20% on Mandarin and 50% on Mandarin-English code-switching
benchmarks compared to Whisper. Results highlight the framework as a compelling
alternative to pseudo-labeling self-distillation approaches and provides a
practical pathway for improving ASR performance in low-resource or
domain-specific settings.

Abstract: Emergence is a concept in complexity science that describes how many-body
systems manifest novel higher-level properties, properties that can be
described by replacing high-dimensional mechanisms with lower-dimensional
effective variables and theories. This is captured by the idea "more is
different". Intelligence is a consummate emergent property manifesting
increasingly efficient -- cheaper and faster -- uses of emergent capabilities
to solve problems. This is captured by the idea "less is more". In this paper,
we first examine claims that Large Language Models exhibit emergent
capabilities, reviewing several approaches to quantifying emergence, and
secondly ask whether LLMs possess emergent intelligence.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了开源和专有大型语言模型（LLMs）在从电子健康记录（EHR）中提取药物信息并分类其状态的能力，发现LLMs表现优异，尤其是GPT-4和开源模型Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从EHR的非结构化笔记中提取药物停用信息对患者安全至关重要，但传统方法效率低。

Method: 使用三个EHR数据集评估12种LLMs，比较药物提取、状态分类及联合任务的性能。

Result: GPT-4在零样本设置下表现最佳（F1分数：提取94.0%，分类78.1%，联合任务72.7%）。开源模型Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct在部分任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: LLMs在药物提取和停用分类上潜力巨大，开源模型可作为专有系统的替代方案，少量样本学习可进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Identifying medication discontinuations in electronic health records (EHRs)
is vital for patient safety but is often hindered by information being buried
in unstructured notes. This study aims to evaluate the capabilities of advanced
open-sourced and proprietary large language models (LLMs) in extracting
medications and classifying their medication status from EHR notes, focusing on
their scalability on medication information extraction without human
annotation. We collected three EHR datasets from diverse sources to build the
evaluation benchmark. We evaluated 12 advanced LLMs and explored multiple LLM
prompting strategies. Performance on medication extraction, medication status
classification, and their joint task (extraction then classification) was
systematically compared across all experiments. We found that LLMs showed
promising performance on the medication extraction and discontinuation
classification from EHR notes. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest average
F1 scores in all tasks under zero-shot setting - 94.0% for medication
extraction, 78.1% for discontinuation classification, and 72.7% for the joint
task. Open-sourced models followed closely, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct achieved the
highest performance in medication status classification on the MIV-Med dataset
(68.7%) and in the joint task on both the Re-CASI (76.2%) and MIV-Med (60.2%)
datasets. Medical-specific LLMs demonstrated lower performance compared to
advanced general-domain LLMs. Few-shot learning generally improved performance,
while CoT reasoning showed inconsistent gains. LLMs demonstrate strong
potential for medication extraction and discontinuation identification on EHR
notes, with open-sourced models offering scalable alternatives to proprietary
systems and few-shot can further improve LLMs' capability.

Motivation: 模拟全球南方研究机构因计算资源昂贵而受限的环境，验证小模型的实用性。

Method: 使用参数少于1B的轻量级模型参与共享任务。

Result: 与优胜团队的F1分数差距在6.46至13.13之间，表明小模型在低预算GPU或无GPU设备上仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: 小模型在资源受限环境下是可行的，且性能接近大模型。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the RETUYT-INCO participation at the BEA 2025
shared task. Our participation was characterized by the decision of using
relatively small models, with fewer than 1B parameters. This self-imposed
restriction tries to represent the conditions in which many research labs or
institutions are in the Global South, where computational power is not easily
accessible due to its prohibitive cost. Even under this restrictive
self-imposed setting, our models managed to stay competitive with the rest of
teams that participated in the shared task. According to the $exact\ F_1$
scores published by the organizers, the performance gaps between our models and
the winners were as follows: $6.46$ in Track 1; $10.24$ in Track 2; $7.85$ in
Track 3; $9.56$ in Track 4; and $13.13$ in Track 5. Considering that the
minimum difference with a winner team is $6.46$ points -- and the maximum
difference is $13.13$ -- according to the $exact\ F_1$ score, we find that
models with a size smaller than 1B parameters are competitive for these tasks,
all of which can be run on computers with a low-budget GPU or even without a
GPU.

Motivation: 现有去偏方法仅针对单一语言，无法利用多语言表示中共享语义空间的优势。

Method: 提出IMSAE方法，通过迭代SVD截断识别和缓解多语言的联合偏置子空间。

Result: 在八种语言和五个人口统计维度上验证了IMSAE的有效性，优于传统单语言和跨语言方法。

Conclusion: IMSAE在多语言去偏任务中表现优异，同时保持模型实用性。

Abstract: Multilingual representations embed words with similar meanings to share a
common semantic space across languages, creating opportunities to transfer
debiasing effects between languages. However, existing methods for debiasing
are unable to exploit this opportunity because they operate on individual
languages. We present Iterative Multilingual Spectral Attribute Erasure
(IMSAE), which identifies and mitigates joint bias subspaces across multiple
languages through iterative SVD-based truncation. Evaluating IMSAE across eight
languages and five demographic dimensions, we demonstrate its effectiveness in
both standard and zero-shot settings, where target language data is
unavailable, but linguistically similar languages can be used for debiasing.
Our comprehensive experiments across diverse language models (BERT, LLaMA,
Mistral) show that IMSAE outperforms traditional monolingual and cross-lingual
approaches while maintaining model utility.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在时间表推理中面临挑战，现有提示技术的影响尚未充分探索，且性能因表结构和上下文差异而波动。

Method: 研究多种提示技术，提出SEAR框架，动态调整提示策略并整合结构化推理。

Result: SEAR在所有表类型中表现最佳，且表结构重构能提升模型推理能力。

Conclusion: SEAR框架显著提升时间表推理性能，表结构统一化进一步优化结果。

Abstract: Temporal Table Reasoning is a critical challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs), requiring effective prompting techniques to extract relevant insights.
Despite existence of multiple prompting methods, their impact on table
reasoning remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, the performance of these
models varies drastically across different table and context structures, making
it difficult to determine an optimal approach. This work investigates multiple
prompting technique across diverse table types to determine optimal approaches
for different scenarios. We find that performance varies based on entity type,
table structure, requirement of additional context and question complexity,
with NO single method consistently outperforming others. To mitigate these
challenges, we introduce SEAR, an adaptive prompting framework inspired by
human reasoning that dynamically adjusts based on context characteristics and
integrates a structured reasoning. Our results demonstrate that SEAR achieves
superior performance across all table types compared to other baseline
prompting techniques. Additionally, we explore the impact of table structure
refactoring, finding that a unified representation enhances model's reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否可以通过学习专用的“继续思考”标记来触发扩展推理，以提升语言模型的性能。

Method: 在蒸馏版的DeepSeek-R1模型中添加一个学习的“<|continue-thinking|>”标记，仅通过强化学习训练其嵌入，同时冻结模型权重。

Result: 学习的标记在标准数学基准测试中比基线模型和使用固定标记的测试时扩展方法表现更好，例如在GSM8K上提升了4.2%。

Conclusion: 学习专用的“继续思考”标记是一种有效的方法，可以显著提升语言模型在推理任务中的准确性。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as an effective approach for improving language
model performance by utilizing additional compute at inference time. Recent
studies have shown that overriding end-of-thinking tokens (e.g., replacing
"</think>" with "Wait") can extend reasoning steps and improve accuracy. In
this work, we explore whether a dedicated continue-thinking token can be
learned to trigger extended reasoning. We augment a distilled version of
DeepSeek-R1 with a single learned "<|continue-thinking|>" token, training only
its embedding via reinforcement learning while keeping the model weights
frozen. Our experiments show that this learned token achieves improved accuracy
on standard math benchmarks compared to both the baseline model and a test-time
scaling approach that uses a fixed token (e.g., "Wait") for budget forcing. In
particular, we observe that in cases where the fixed-token approach enhances
the base model's accuracy, our method achieves a markedly greater improvement.
For example, on the GSM8K benchmark, the fixed-token approach yields a 1.3%
absolute improvement in accuracy, whereas our learned-token method achieves a
4.2% improvement over the base model that does not use budget forcing.

Motivation: 课程学习在多个机器学习领域已显示出提升训练效率和泛化能力的潜力，但在预训练语言模型中的应用尚未充分探索，因此本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 研究尝试了多种课程学习设置，包括基础课程学习、基于步调的采样和交错课程，并基于六种难度指标（涵盖语言学和信息论视角）进行指导。

Result: 实验结果显示，课程学习在早期和中期训练阶段显著提升收敛速度，作为预热策略时能带来持续增益（最高提升3.5%）。压缩比、词汇多样性和可读性被证明是有效的难度信号。

Conclusion: 研究强调了数据排序在大规模预训练中的重要性，并为实际训练场景下的高效模型开发提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Curriculum learning has shown promise in improving training efficiency and
generalization in various machine learning domains, yet its potential in
pretraining language models remains underexplored, prompting our work as the
first systematic investigation in this area. We experimented with different
settings, including vanilla curriculum learning, pacing-based sampling, and
interleaved curricula-guided by six difficulty metrics spanning linguistic and
information-theoretic perspectives. We train models under these settings and
evaluate their performance on eight diverse benchmarks. Our experiments reveal
that curriculum learning consistently improves convergence in early and
mid-training phases, and can yield lasting gains when used as a warmup strategy
with up to $3.5\%$ improvement. Notably, we identify compression ratio, lexical
diversity, and readability as effective difficulty signals across settings. Our
findings highlight the importance of data ordering in large-scale pretraining
and provide actionable insights for scalable, data-efficient model development
under realistic training scenarios.

TL;DR: Avey是一种新型神经网络架构，摆脱了注意力和循环结构的限制，能够有效处理任意长序列，并在长距离依赖任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在处理长序列时存在固定上下文窗口和二次复杂度的问题，而RNN架构虽能线性扩展序列长度但并行性受限。Avey旨在解决这些问题。

Method: Avey由排序器和自回归神经处理器组成，协同识别并上下文化最相关的标记，解耦序列长度与上下文宽度。

Result: Avey在短距离NLP任务中表现与Transformer相当，在长距离依赖任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: Avey为长序列处理提供了一种高效且灵活的替代方案。

Abstract: The Transformer has become the de facto standard for large language models
and a wide range of downstream tasks across various domains. Despite its
numerous advantages like inherent training parallelism, the Transformer still
faces key challenges due to its inability to effectively process sequences
beyond a fixed context window and the quadratic complexity of its attention
mechanism. These challenges have renewed interest in RNN-like architectures,
which offer linear scaling with sequence length and improved handling of
long-range dependencies, albeit with limited parallelism due to their
inherently recurrent nature. In this paper, we propose Avey, a new neural
foundational architecture that breaks away from both attention and recurrence.
Avey comprises a ranker and an autoregressive neural processor, which
collaboratively identify and contextualize only the most relevant tokens for
any given token, regardless of their positions in the sequence. Specifically,
Avey decouples sequence length from context width, thus enabling effective
processing of arbitrarily long sequences. Experimental results show that Avey
compares favorably to the Transformer across a variety of standard short-range
NLP benchmarks, while notably excelling at capturing long-range dependencies.

Method: 使用17个预训练的Transformer模型，在三种语言家族和两个fMRI数据集上评估其预测能力。

Result: 模型困惑度与预测能力呈正相关，表明这一趋势不仅限于阅读时间，也适用于神经测量。

Conclusion: Transformer模型的困惑度与预测能力的正相关具有普遍性，适用于多种语言处理测量方式。

Abstract: As Transformers become more widely incorporated into natural language
processing tasks, there has been considerable interest in using surprisal from
these models as predictors of human sentence processing difficulty. Recent work
has observed a positive relationship between Transformer-based models'
perplexity and the predictive power of their surprisal estimates on reading
times, showing that language models with more parameters and trained on more
data are less predictive of human reading times. However, these studies focus
on predicting latency-based measures (i.e., self-paced reading times and
eye-gaze durations) with surprisal estimates from Transformer-based language
models. This trend has not been tested on brain imaging data. This study
therefore evaluates the predictive power of surprisal estimates from 17
pre-trained Transformer-based models across three different language families
on two functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets. Results show that the
positive relationship between model perplexity and model fit still obtains,
suggesting that this trend is not specific to latency-based measures and can be
generalized to neural measures.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) offers unprecedented opportunities
to reimagine peer review beyond the constraints of traditional workflows.
Despite these opportunities, prior efforts have largely focused on replicating
traditional review workflows with LLMs serving as direct substitutes for human
reviewers, while limited attention has been given to exploring new paradigms
that fundamentally rethink how LLMs can participate in the academic review
process. In this paper, we introduce and explore a novel mechanism that employs
LLM agents to perform pairwise comparisons among manuscripts instead of
individual scoring. By aggregating outcomes from substantial pairwise
evaluations, this approach enables a more accurate and robust measure of
relative manuscript quality. Our experiments demonstrate that this comparative
approach significantly outperforms traditional rating-based methods in
identifying high-impact papers. However, our analysis also reveals emergent
biases in the selection process, notably a reduced novelty in research topics
and an increased institutional imbalance. These findings highlight both the
transformative potential of rethinking peer review with LLMs and critical
challenges that future systems must address to ensure equity and diversity.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to Speaker Diarization (SD) by leveraging
text-based methods focused on Sentence-level Speaker Change Detection within
dialogues. Unlike audio-based SD systems, which are often challenged by audio
quality and speaker similarity, our approach utilizes the dialogue transcript
alone. Two models are developed: the Single Prediction Model (SPM) and the
Multiple Prediction Model (MPM), both of which demonstrate significant
improvements in identifying speaker changes, particularly in short
conversations. Our findings, based on a curated dataset encompassing diverse
conversational scenarios, reveal that the text-based SD approach, especially
the MPM, performs competitively against state-of-the-art audio-based SD
systems, with superior performance in short conversational contexts. This paper
not only showcases the potential of leveraging linguistic features for SD but
also highlights the importance of integrating semantic understanding into SD
systems, opening avenues for future research in multimodal and semantic
feature-based diarization.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in many fields,
understanding and mitigating LLM biases is an ongoing issue. This paper
provides a novel method for evaluating the demographic biases of various
generative AI models. By prompting models to assess a moral patient's
willingness to intervene constructively, we aim to quantitatively evaluate
different LLMs' biases towards various genders, races, and ages. Our work
differs from existing work by aiming to determine the baseline demographic
identities for various commercial models and the relationship between the
baseline and other demographics. We strive to understand if these biases are
positive, neutral, or negative, and the strength of these biases. This paper
can contribute to the objective assessment of bias in Large Language Models and
give the user or developer the power to account for these biases in LLM output
or in training future LLMs. Our analysis suggested two key findings: that
models view the baseline demographic as a white middle-aged or young adult
male; however, a general trend across models suggested that non-baseline
demographics are more willing to help than the baseline. These methodologies
allowed us to distinguish these two biases that are often tangled together.

Result: 在100M和1.2B参数规模下，CGLS在PIQA、ARC等基准测试中表现优异，泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: CGLS通过渐进式堆叠，为知识密集和推理任务提供了一种简单有效的预训练策略。

Abstract: As the cost of pretraining large language models grows, there is continued
interest in strategies to improve learning efficiency during this core training
stage. Motivated by cognitive development, where humans gradually build
knowledge as their brains mature, we propose Curriculum-Guided Layer Scaling
(CGLS), a framework for compute-efficient pretraining that synchronizes
increasing data difficulty with model growth through progressive layer stacking
(i.e. gradually adding layers during training). At the 100M parameter scale,
using a curriculum transitioning from synthetic short stories to general web
data, CGLS outperforms baseline methods on the question-answering benchmarks
PIQA and ARC. Pretraining at the 1.2B scale, we stratify the DataComp-LM corpus
with a DistilBERT-based classifier and progress from general text to highly
technical or specialized content. Our results show that progressively
increasing model depth alongside sample difficulty leads to better
generalization and zero-shot performance on various downstream benchmarks.
Altogether, our findings demonstrate that CGLS unlocks the potential of
progressive stacking, offering a simple yet effective strategy for improving
generalization on knowledge-intensive and reasoning tasks.

Result: 内存使用减少80%，解码速度提升3.19倍，延迟降低2.72倍。

Conclusion: Chelsea高效且性能接近原始模型，适用于长上下文LLMs。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows have become
increasingly prevalent for tackling complex tasks. However, the substantial
Key-Value (KV) cache required for long-context LLMs poses significant
deployment challenges. Existing approaches either discard potentially critical
information needed for future generations or offer limited efficiency gains due
to high computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce Chelsea, a simple
yet effective framework for online KV cache clustering. Our approach is based
on the observation that key states exhibit high similarity along the sequence
dimension. To enable efficient clustering, we divide the sequence into chunks
and propose Chunked Soft Matching, which employs an alternating partition
strategy within each chunk and identifies clusters based on similarity. Chelsea
then merges the KV cache within each cluster into a single centroid.
Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the computational complexity
and the optimality of the intra-chunk partitioning strategy. Extensive
experiments across various models and long-context benchmarks demonstrate that
Chelsea achieves up to 80% reduction in KV cache memory usage while maintaining
comparable model performance. Moreover, with minimal computational overhead,
Chelsea accelerates the decoding stage of inference by up to 3.19$\times$ and
reduces end-to-end latency by up to 2.72$\times$.

Motivation: 传统的RLVR方法在复杂的多步问题解决环境中效果不佳，因为奖励稀疏，难以有效训练模型。Agent-RLVR旨在通过模拟人类教学方式，提供多样化的引导信息，提升代理在复杂环境中的表现。

Method: Agent-RLVR结合了代理引导机制，通过高层次的策略计划和动态反馈，指导代理完成任务。训练过程中，代理首先尝试生成初始轨迹，然后通过单元测试验证并补充引导信息，最终通过RLVR更新策略。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has been widely adopted
as the de facto method for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large
language models and has demonstrated notable success in verifiable domains like
math and competitive programming tasks. However, the efficacy of RLVR
diminishes significantly when applied to agentic environments. These settings,
characterized by multi-step, complex problem solving, lead to high failure
rates even for frontier LLMs, as the reward landscape is too sparse for
effective model training via conventional RLVR. In this work, we introduce
Agent-RLVR, a framework that makes RLVR effective in challenging agentic
settings, with an initial focus on software engineering tasks. Inspired by
human pedagogy, Agent-RLVR introduces agent guidance, a mechanism that actively
steers the agent towards successful trajectories by leveraging diverse
informational cues. These cues, ranging from high-level strategic plans to
dynamic feedback on the agent's errors and environmental interactions, emulate
a teacher's guidance, enabling the agent to navigate difficult solution spaces
and promotes active self-improvement via additional environment exploration. In
the Agent-RLVR training loop, agents first attempt to solve tasks to produce
initial trajectories, which are then validated by unit tests and supplemented
with agent guidance. Agents then reattempt with guidance, and the agent policy
is updated with RLVR based on the rewards of these guided trajectories.
Agent-RLVR elevates the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct from 9.4%
to 22.4% on SWE-Bench Verified. We find that our guidance-augmented RLVR data
is additionally useful for test-time reward model training, shown by further
boosting pass@1 to 27.8%. Agent-RLVR lays the groundwork for training agents
with RLVR in complex, real-world environments where conventional RL methods
struggle.

*Taeeun Kim,Semin Jeong,Youngsook Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KoGEC是一个基于预训练翻译模型的韩语语法纠错系统，通过微调NLLB模型，在韩语GEC任务中表现优于GPT-4和HCX-3。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个高效的韩语语法纠错系统，并探索任务专用模型在特定NLP任务中的潜力。

Method: 微调NLLB模型，使用特殊语言标记区分原始和纠正句子，并通过BLEU分数和LLM评估方法进行测试。

Result: KoGEC在韩语GEC任务中表现优于GPT-4和HCX-3，尤其在多种错误类型上更均衡。

Conclusion: KoGEC为NLP领域提供了高效的韩语GEC系统和新的评估方法，展示了任务专用模型的竞争力。

Abstract: This research introduces KoGEC, a Korean Grammatical Error Correction system
using pre\--trained translation models. We fine-tuned NLLB (No Language Left
Behind) models for Korean GEC, comparing their performance against large
language models like GPT-4 and HCX-3. The study used two social media
conversation datasets for training and testing. The NLLB models were fine-tuned
using special language tokens to distinguish between original and corrected
Korean sentences. Evaluation was done using BLEU scores and an "LLM as judge"
method to classify error types. Results showed that the fine-tuned NLLB (KoGEC)
models outperformed GPT-4o and HCX-3 in Korean GEC tasks. KoGEC demonstrated a
more balanced error correction profile across various error types, whereas the
larger LLMs tended to focus less on punctuation errors. We also developed a
Chrome extension to make the KoGEC system accessible to users. Finally, we
explored token vocabulary expansion to further improve the model but found it
to decrease model performance. This research contributes to the field of NLP by
providing an efficient, specialized Korean GEC system and a new evaluation
method. It also highlights the potential of compact, task-specific models to
compete with larger, general-purpose language models in specialized NLP tasks.

*Harvey Yiyun Fu,Aryan Shrivastava,Jared Moore,Peter West,Chenhao Tan,Ari Holtzman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了AbsenceBench，用于评估大语言模型（LLM）检测缺失信息的能力，发现即使先进模型如Claude-3.7-Sonnet在此任务上表现不佳（F1-score仅69.6%），揭示了Transformer注意力机制在检测‘空白’信息时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在长文本中定位特定信息（如NIAH测试）表现优异，但在检测明显缺失信息时仍存在困难，因此需要评估其在这方面的能力。

Method: 通过AbsenceBench测试模型在三个领域（数字序列、诗歌、GitHub拉取请求）中识别被故意移除信息的能力，对比原始和编辑后的文本。

Result: 实验显示，即使先进模型如Claude-3.7-Sonnet在平均5K tokens的上下文长度下，F1-score仅为69.6%，表现不佳。

Conclusion: Transformer注意力机制难以处理‘空白’信息，导致模型在检测缺失信息时表现不佳，揭示了其局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of processing long
inputs and locating specific information within them, as evidenced by their
performance on the Needle in a Haystack (NIAH) test. However, while models
excel at recalling surprising information, they still struggle to identify
clearly omitted information. We introduce AbsenceBench to assesses LLMs'
capacity to detect missing information across three domains: numerical
sequences, poetry, and GitHub pull requests. AbsenceBench asks models to
identify which pieces of a document were deliberately removed, given access to
both the original and edited contexts. Despite the apparent straightforwardness
of these tasks, our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art models like
Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieve only 69.6% F1-score with a modest average context
length of 5K tokens. Our analysis suggests this poor performance stems from a
fundamental limitation: Transformer attention mechanisms cannot easily attend
to "gaps" in documents since these absences don't correspond to any specific
keys that can be attended to. Overall, our results and analysis provide a case
study of the close proximity of tasks where models are already superhuman
(NIAH) and tasks where models breakdown unexpectedly (AbsenceBench).

*Carlos Rafael Catalan*

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在低资源语言机器翻译系统中，如何解决数据集和人类评估者短缺的问题，提出了一种招募和游戏化评估平台的设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言的机器翻译系统缺乏有效的自动评估指标和足够的人类评估者，导致评估不全面。

Method: 通过综述现有评估方法，设计了一个招募和游戏化评估平台。

Result: 提出了一个平台设计，用于解决数据集和评估者短缺问题。

Conclusion: 该平台有望应用于更广泛的自然语言处理研究，但评估其效果仍具挑战性。

Abstract: Human evaluators provide necessary contributions in evaluating large language
models. In the context of Machine Translation (MT) systems for low-resource
languages (LRLs), this is made even more apparent since popular automated
metrics tend to be string-based, and therefore do not provide a full picture of
the nuances of the behavior of the system. Human evaluators, when equipped with
the necessary expertise of the language, will be able to test for adequacy,
fluency, and other important metrics. However, the low resource nature of the
language means that both datasets and evaluators are in short supply. This
presents the following conundrum: How can developers of MT systems for these
LRLs find adequate human evaluators and datasets? This paper first presents a
comprehensive review of existing evaluation procedures, with the objective of
producing a design proposal for a platform that addresses the resource gap in
terms of datasets and evaluators in developing MT systems. The result is a
design for a recruitment and gamified evaluation platform for developers of MT
systems. Challenges are also discussed in terms of evaluating this platform, as
well as its possible applications in the wider scope of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在临床决策中难以定位和纠正推理过程中的错误，而医学领域对此需求迫切。

Method: 利用检索增强生成技术，结合医学知识库验证每个推理步骤，精细评估推理质量。

Result: 在五个医学QA基准和两个开放诊断任务中表现优异，基础模型性能提升高达13.50%，小规模模型首次在MedQA上达到80%以上准确率。

Conclusion: Med-PRM通过验证推理步骤显著提升临床决策准确性，并展示了其通用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Large language models have shown promise in clinical decision making, but
current approaches struggle to localize and correct errors at specific steps of
the reasoning process. This limitation is critical in medicine, where
identifying and addressing reasoning errors is essential for accurate diagnosis
and effective patient care. We introduce Med-PRM, a process reward modeling
framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation to verify each
reasoning step against established medical knowledge bases. By verifying
intermediate reasoning steps with evidence retrieved from clinical guidelines
and literature, our model can precisely assess the reasoning quality in a
fine-grained manner. Evaluations on five medical QA benchmarks and two
open-ended diagnostic tasks demonstrate that Med-PRM achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with improving the performance of base models by up to 13.50%
using Med-PRM. Moreover, we demonstrate the generality of Med-PRM by
integrating it in a plug-and-play fashion with strong policy models such as
Meerkat, achieving over 80\% accuracy on MedQA for the first time using
small-scale models of 8 billion parameters. Our code and data are available at:

Domain specific language models have already been in use for biomedical natural

grown towards medical language models and their understanding capabilities. In
this paper, we investigate the medical conceptual grounding of various language
models against expert clinicians for identification of hallmarks of
immunotherapy in breast cancer abstracts. Our results show that pre-trained
language models have potential to outperform large language models in
identifying very specific (low-level) concepts.

TL;DR: 研究探讨BERT是否编码抽象关系模式，发现预训练BERT虽能高精度分类关系，但关系模式需通过微调任务诱导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（如BERT）的语义任务表现是否反映真实概念能力，而非表面统计关联。

Method: 通过分析BERT内部表示，比较概念对在分类任务中的表现与[CLS]标记嵌入的结构。

Result: 预训练BERT能高精度分类关系，但关系类型仅在微调后在高维嵌入空间中组织。

Conclusion: 行为表现不一定反映结构化概念理解，但模型可通过适当训练获得关系抽象的归纳偏差。

Abstract: While large language models like BERT demonstrate strong empirical
performance on semantic tasks, whether this reflects true conceptual competence
or surface-level statistical association remains unclear. I investigate whether
BERT encodes abstract relational schemata by examining internal representations
of concept pairs across taxonomic, mereological, and functional relations. I
compare BERT's relational classification performance with representational
structure in [CLS] token embeddings. Results reveal that pretrained BERT
enables high classification accuracy, indicating latent relational signals.
However, concept pairs organize by relation type in high-dimensional embedding
space only after fine-tuning on supervised relation classification tasks. This
indicates relational schemata are not emergent from pretraining alone but can
be induced via task scaffolding. These findings demonstrate that behavioral
performance does not necessarily imply structured conceptual understanding,
though models can acquire inductive biases for grounded relational abstraction
through appropriate training.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Lag-Relative Sparse Attention（LRSA）的方法，通过LagKV压缩技术优化长上下文处理，减少计算和内存开销，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在处理长上下文输入时面临计算复杂度和内存占用的问题，现有压缩技术常导致性能下降，且不适用于训练后优化。

Method: 采用LRSA方法，结合LagKV压缩技术，通过分块预填充选择最相关的键值对，聚焦关键历史上下文。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了LLM在键值压缩下的鲁棒性，并在问答任务中取得更好的微调效果。

Conclusion: LRSA为长上下文处理提供了一种高效且低开销的解决方案，适用于训练后优化。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in natural
language processing and generation, yet their ability to handle long-context
input remains constrained by the quadratic complexity of attention computation
and linear-increasing key-value memory footprint. To reduce computational costs
and memory, key-value cache compression techniques are commonly applied at
inference time, but this often leads to severe performance degradation, as
models are not trained to handle compressed context. Although there are more
sophisticated compression methods, they are typically unsuitable for
post-training because of their incompatibility with gradient-based optimization
or high computation overhead. To fill this gap with no additional parameter and
little computation overhead, we propose Lag-Relative Sparse Attention(LRSA)
anchored by the LagKV compression method for long context post-training. Our
method performs chunk-by-chunk prefilling, which selects the top K most
relevant key-value pairs in a fixed-size lagging window, allowing the model to
focus on salient historical context while maintaining efficiency. Experimental
results show that our approach significantly enhances the robustness of the LLM
with key-value compression and achieves better fine-tuned results in the
question-answer tuning task.

Method: 提出了三种集成方法，包括两步法和端到端法，并引入参数共享策略。

Result: 端到端法性能与两步法相当，参数共享策略减少了参数数量并提升了性能。

Conclusion: 端到端法在多模态对话响应检索中表现优异，参数共享策略是有效的优化手段。

Abstract: Multimodal chatbots have become one of the major topics for dialogue systems
in both research community and industry. Recently, researchers have shed light
on the multimodality of responses as well as dialogue contexts. This work
explores how a dialogue system can output responses in various modalities such
as text and image. To this end, we first formulate a multimodal dialogue
response retrieval task for retrieval-based systems as the combination of three
subtasks. We then propose three integration methods based on a two-step
approach and an end-to-end approach, and compare the merits and demerits of
each method. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that the
end-to-end approach achieves comparable performance without an intermediate
step in the two-step approach. In addition, a parameter sharing strategy not
only reduces the number of parameters but also boosts performance by
transferring knowledge across the subtasks and the modalities.

Result: 实验显示个性化响应质量显著提升，更接近人类对话。

Conclusion: MUDI方法有效提升个性化对话生成的自然性和一致性。

Abstract: In dialogue generation, the naturalness of responses is crucial for effective
human-machine interaction. Personalized response generation poses even greater
challenges, as the responses must remain coherent and consistent with the
user's personal traits or persona descriptions. We propose MUDI
($\textbf{Mu}$ltiple $\textbf{Di}$scourse Relations Graph Learning) for
personalized dialogue generation. We utilize a Large Language Model to assist
in annotating discourse relations and to transform dialogue data into
structured dialogue graphs. Our graph encoder, the proposed DialogueGAT model,
then captures implicit discourse relations within this structure, along with
persona descriptions. During the personalized response generation phase, novel
coherence-aware attention strategies are implemented to enhance the decoder's
consideration of discourse relations. Our experiments demonstrate significant
improvements in the quality of personalized responses, thus resembling
human-like dialogue exchanges.

Motivation: 研究目的是评估LLMs在多语言文本标注任务中的有效性，并比较其与专用模型的性能差异。

Method: 使用MultiDiac数据集评估14种LLMs和6种专用模型，并对4种开源小模型进行LoRA微调。

Result: 许多现成LLMs在阿拉伯语和约鲁巴语标注任务中优于专用模型，但小模型存在幻觉问题；微调可改善性能。

Conclusion: LLMs在多语言文本标注任务中具有潜力，小模型通过微调可优化性能。

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) for text
diacritization in two typologically distinct languages: Arabic and Yoruba. To
enable a rigorous evaluation, we introduce a novel multilingual dataset
MultiDiac, with diverse samples that capture a range of diacritic ambiguities.
We evaluate 14 LLMs varying in size, accessibility, and language coverage, and
benchmark them against 6 specialized diacritization models. Additionally, we
fine-tune four small open-source models using LoRA for Yoruba. Our results show
that many off-the-shelf LLMs outperform specialized diacritization models for
both Arabic and Yoruba, but smaller models suffer from hallucinations.
Fine-tuning on a small dataset can help improve diacritization performance and
reduce hallucination rates.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索场景上下文如何影响人类对同一物体的不同概念化和命名方式。

Method: 使用SceneGram数据集，分析人类在不同场景中对抽象形状的命名，并对比多模态LLM的表现。

Result: 多模态LLM未能捕捉人类概念化的丰富性和变异性。

Conclusion: 场景上下文对概念化有显著影响，而现有模型在此方面存在不足。

Abstract: Research on reference and naming suggests that humans can come up with very
different ways of conceptualizing and referring to the same object, e.g. the
same abstract tangram shape can be a "crab", "sink" or "space ship". Another
common assumption in cognitive science is that scene context fundamentally
shapes our visual perception of objects and conceptual expectations. This paper
contributes SceneGram, a dataset of human references to tangram shapes placed
in different scene contexts, allowing for systematic analyses of the effect of
scene context on conceptualization. Based on this data, we analyze references
to tangram shapes generated by multimodal LLMs, showing that these models do
not account for the richness and variability of conceptualizations found in
human references.

Conclusion: LoRA-Gen显著提升边缘侧模型的效率和性能，无需专门训练。

Abstract: Recent advances have highlighted the benefits of scaling language models to
enhance performance across a wide range of NLP tasks. However, these approaches
still face limitations in effectiveness and efficiency when applied to
domain-specific tasks, particularly for small edge-side models. We propose the
LoRA-Gen framework, which utilizes a large cloud-side model to generate LoRA
parameters for edge-side models based on task descriptions. By employing the
reparameterization technique, we merge the LoRA parameters into the edge-side
model to achieve flexible specialization. Our method facilitates knowledge
transfer between models while significantly improving the inference efficiency
of the specialized model by reducing the input context length. Without
specialized training, LoRA-Gen outperforms conventional LoRA fine-tuning, which
achieves competitive accuracy and a 2.1x speedup with TinyLLaMA-1.1B in
reasoning tasks. Besides, our method delivers a compression ratio of 10.1x with

Motivation: 公开可用的高质量CRF数据集稀缺，限制了CRF填充系统的开发。

Method: 提出半自动转换方法，将信息提取任务数据集转换为结构化CRF，应用于E3C数据集。

Result: 生成的新数据集显示，CRF填充任务对LLM具有挑战性（意大利语59.7%，英语67.3%）。

Conclusion: 通过转换现有数据集，成功生成了高质量的CRF填充数据集，并揭示了LLM在此任务上的局限性。

Abstract: Case Report Forms (CRFs) are largely used in medical research as they ensure
accuracy, reliability, and validity of results in clinical studies. However,
publicly available, wellannotated CRF datasets are scarce, limiting the
development of CRF slot filling systems able to fill in a CRF from clinical
notes. To mitigate the scarcity of CRF datasets, we propose to take advantage
of available datasets annotated for information extraction tasks and to convert
them into structured CRFs. We present a semi-automatic conversion methodology,
which has been applied to the E3C dataset in two languages (English and
Italian), resulting in a new, high-quality dataset for CRF slot filling.
Through several experiments on the created dataset, we report that slot filling
achieves 59.7% for Italian and 67.3% for English on a closed Large Language
Models (zero-shot) and worse performances on three families of open-source
models, showing that filling CRFs is challenging even for recent
state-of-the-art LLMs. We release the datest at

Motivation: 研究如何更精准地移除目标信息以评估其对模型行为的影响，避免INLP方法的随机性问题。

Method: 提出Mean Projection (MP)和LEACE两种方法，用于更精准地移除目标信息。

Result: MP和LEACE能更有效地移除目标信息，提升Amnesic Probing的解释能力。

Conclusion: MP和LEACE是INLP的有效替代方法，能更精准地分析模型行为。

Abstract: Amnesic probing is a technique used to examine the influence of specific
linguistic information on the behaviour of a model. This involves identifying
and removing the relevant information and then assessing whether the model's
performance on the main task changes. If the removed information is relevant,
the model's performance should decline. The difficulty with this approach lies
in removing only the target information while leaving other information
unchanged. It has been shown that Iterative Nullspace Projection (INLP), a
widely used removal technique, introduces random modifications to
representations when eliminating target information. We demonstrate that Mean
Projection (MP) and LEACE, two proposed alternatives, remove information in a
more targeted manner, thereby enhancing the potential for obtaining behavioural
explanations through Amnesic Probing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人类反馈模型（如DPO）假设偏好是静态且单一的，限制了模型的适应性。

Method: CPT利用基于结构化、细粒度规则生成的合成偏好数据，通过微调使模型能根据系统提示动态调整输出。

Result: 实验表明，CPT能实现细粒度控制，并建模更复杂、上下文相关的人类反馈。

Conclusion: CPT为语言模型提供了动态适应性和更精细的控制能力，相关代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Models of human feedback for AI alignment, such as those underpinning Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), often bake in a singular, static set of
preferences, limiting adaptability. This paper challenges the assumption of
monolithic preferences by introducing Configurable Preference Tuning (CPT), a
novel framework for endowing language models with the ability to dynamically
adjust their behavior based on explicit, human-interpretable directives. CPT
leverages synthetically generated preference data, conditioned on system
prompts derived from structured, fine-grained rubrics that define desired
attributes like writing style. By fine-tuning with these rubric-guided
preferences, the LLM learns to modulate its outputs at inference time in
response to the system prompt, without retraining. This approach not only
offers fine-grained control but also provides a mechanism for modeling more
nuanced and context-dependent human feedback. Several experimental artifacts,
such as training code, generated datasets and fine-tuned models are released at

Result: 实验表明，MIP算术在三种代表性CPU架构上比浮点实现具有显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 论文标志着矩阵乘法优化的新时代，适应了深度学习推理对异构架构的需求，称之为矩阵乘法的“寒武纪时期”。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have led to a shift from traditional
64-bit floating point (FP64) computations toward reduced-precision formats,
such as FP16, BF16, and 8- or 16-bit integers, combined with mixed-precision
arithmetic. This transition enhances computational throughput, reduces memory
and bandwidth usage, and improves energy efficiency, offering significant
advantages for resource-constrained edge devices. To support this shift,
hardware architectures have evolved accordingly, now including adapted ISAs
(Instruction Set Architectures) that expose mixed-precision vector units and
matrix engines tailored for DL workloads. At the heart of many DL and
scientific computing tasks is the general matrix-matrix multiplication gemm, a
fundamental kernel historically optimized using axpy vector instructions on
SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) units. However, as hardware moves
toward mixed-precision dot-product-centric operations optimized for quantized
inference, these legacy approaches are being phased out. In response to this,
our paper revisits traditional high-performance gemm and describes strategies
for adapting it to mixed-precision integer (MIP) arithmetic across modern ISAs,
including x86_64, ARM, and RISC-V. Concretely, we illustrate novel micro-kernel
designs and data layouts that better exploit today's specialized hardware and
demonstrate significant performance gains from MIP arithmetic over
floating-point implementations across three representative CPU architectures.
These contributions highlight a new era of gemm optimization-driven by the
demands of DL inference on heterogeneous architectures, marking what we term as
the "Cambrian period" for matrix multiplication.

*Nan Jiang,Ziming Wu,De-Chuan Zhan,Fuming Lai,Shaobing Lian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DART提出了一种自蒸馏框架，用非自回归的Silent Thought（ST）替代自回归的Chain-of-Thought（CoT），显著提升了推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归的CoT推理计算开销大，限制了其在延迟敏感应用中的部署，DART旨在解决这一问题。

Method: DART通过CoT和ST两条训练路径，利用Reasoning Evolvement Module（REM）对齐隐藏状态，使ST令牌直接生成答案。

Result: 实验表明，DART在保持推理性能的同时显著提升了效率。

Conclusion: DART是高效推理的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced Large Language
Models (LLMs) in solving complex tasks. However, its autoregressive paradigm
leads to significant computational overhead, hindering its deployment in
latency-sensitive applications. To address this, we propose \textbf{DART}
(\textbf{D}istilling \textbf{A}utoregressive \textbf{R}easoning to Silent
\textbf{T}hought), a self-distillation framework that enables LLMs to replace
autoregressive CoT with non-autoregressive Silent Thought (ST). Specifically,
DART introduces two training pathways: the CoT pathway for traditional
reasoning and the ST pathway for generating answers directly from a few ST
tokens. The ST pathway utilizes a lightweight Reasoning Evolvement Module (REM)
to align its hidden states with the CoT pathway, enabling the ST tokens to
evolve into informative embeddings. During inference, only the ST pathway is
activated, leveraging evolving ST tokens to deliver the answer directly.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DART achieves comparable
reasoning performance to existing baselines while offering significant
efficiency gains, serving as a feasible alternative for efficient reasoning.

*Mingxuan Du,Benfeng Xu,Chiwei Zhu,Xiaorui Wang,Zhendong Mao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepResearch Bench是一个用于评估基于LLM的深度研究代理（DRA）能力的基准测试，包含100个博士级研究任务，并提出两种新方法来评估报告质量和信息检索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏系统性评估深度研究代理（DRA）能力的基准测试，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 提出两种方法：基于参考的自适应标准评估报告质量，以及评估信息检索能力的引用计数和准确性框架。

Result: 开发了DeepResearch Bench，并开源了基准测试和关键框架组件。

Conclusion: DeepResearch Bench有助于加速实用LLM代理的发展。

Abstract: Deep Research Agents are a prominent category of LLM-based agents. By
autonomously orchestrating multistep web exploration, targeted retrieval, and
higher-order synthesis, they transform vast amounts of online information into
analyst-grade, citation-rich reports--compressing hours of manual desk research
into minutes. However, a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating
the capabilities of these agents remains absent. To bridge this gap, we present
DeepResearch Bench, a benchmark consisting of 100 PhD-level research tasks,
each meticulously crafted by domain experts across 22 distinct fields.
Evaluating DRAs is inherently complex and labor-intensive. We therefore propose
two novel methodologies that achieve strong alignment with human judgment. The
first is a reference-based method with adaptive criteria to assess the quality
of generated research reports. The other framework is introduced to evaluate
DRA's information retrieval and collection capabilities by assessing its
effective citation count and overall citation accuracy. We have open-sourced
DeepResearch Bench and key components of these frameworks at
https://github.com/Ayanami0730/deep_research_bench to accelerate the
development of practical LLM-based agents.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新视角，关注输出分布而非输入特征，以解决LLMs在长上下文建模中的长度泛化问题，并提出了一种正则化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在长上下文建模中受限于固定的上下文窗口，长度泛化能力不足，传统方法多关注输入特征，而本文转向输出分布。

Method: 通过合成任务案例研究，提出“长短对齐”概念，并设计Long-Short Misalignment指标；进一步提出正则化项以促进训练中的对齐。

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性，Long-Short Misalignment与长度泛化性能强相关。

Conclusion: 研究为LLMs的长上下文建模提供了新思路，正则化方法显著提升了长度泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive performance and
surprising emergent properties. However, their effectiveness remains limited by
the fixed context window of the transformer architecture, posing challenges for
long-context modeling. Among these challenges, length generalization -- the
ability to generalize to sequences longer than those seen during training -- is
a classical and fundamental problem. In this work, we propose a fresh
perspective on length generalization, shifting the focus from the conventional
emphasis on input features such as positional encodings or data structures to
the output distribution of the model. Specifically, through case studies on
synthetic tasks, we highlight the critical role of \textbf{long-short
alignment} -- the consistency of output distributions across sequences of
varying lengths. Extending this insight to natural language tasks, we propose a
metric called Long-Short Misalignment to quantify this phenomenon, uncovering a
strong correlation between the metric and length generalization performance.
Building on these findings, we develop a regularization term that promotes
long-short alignment during training. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach, offering new insights for achieving more
effective long-context modeling in LLMs. Code is available at

TL;DR: 研究探讨了零样本角色提示是否能预测欧洲议会议员的投票行为，发现其预测效果较好，F1分数约为0.793。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在政治话语中表现出进步左倾偏见，研究旨在验证角色提示是否能准确预测个体投票行为及群体政策立场。

Method: 使用零样本角色提示，分析其对欧洲议会议员投票行为的预测能力，并评估其对反事实论点、不同角色提示和生成方法的稳定性。

Result: 研究发现，角色提示能较好地模拟欧洲议会议员的投票行为，加权F1分数达到约0.793。

Conclusion: 零样本角色提示可用于预测政治行为，为政策立场模拟提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display remarkable capabilities to understand or
even produce political discourse, but have been found to consistently display a
progressive left-leaning bias. At the same time, so-called persona or identity
prompts have been shown to produce LLM behavior that aligns with socioeconomic
groups that the base model is not aligned with. In this work, we analyze
whether zero-shot persona prompting with limited information can accurately
predict individual voting decisions and, by aggregation, accurately predict
positions of European groups on a diverse set of policies. We evaluate if
predictions are stable towards counterfactual arguments, different persona
prompts and generation methods. Finally, we find that we can simulate voting
behavior of Members of the European Parliament reasonably well with a weighted
F1 score of approximately 0.793. Our persona dataset of politicians in the 2024
European Parliament and our code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管任务对人类来说简单，但对多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的语用能力是一个重要测试。

Method: 通过指代消解任务，使用简单抽象视觉刺激（如色块和色格）评估MLLMs的语言能力。

Result: 结果表明，即使是基本的语用能力（如颜色描述的上下文依赖解释），对当前最先进的MLLMs仍是主要挑战。

Conclusion: MLLMs在基本语用能力方面仍需改进，尤其是在处理上下文依赖的视觉语言任务时。

Abstract: We investigate the linguistic abilities of multimodal large language models
in reference resolution tasks featuring simple yet abstract visual stimuli,
such as color patches and color grids. Although the task may not seem
challenging for today's language models, being straightforward for human dyads,
we consider it to be a highly relevant probe of the pragmatic capabilities of
MLLMs. Our results and analyses indeed suggest that basic pragmatic

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PPA的两阶段框架，通过后验对齐策略提升多轮对话中一致性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成个性化对话时难以兼顾长期一致性和多样性，PPA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: PPA首先生成通用响应，再根据响应检索相关人物记忆，最后对齐响应与人物特征。

Result: 实验表明PPA在一致性、多样性和人物相关性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PPA为长期个性化对话生成提供了更灵活有效的范式。

Abstract: Multi-session persona-based dialogue generation presents challenges in
maintaining long-term consistency and generating diverse, personalized
responses. While large language models (LLMs) excel in single-session
dialogues, they struggle to preserve persona fidelity and conversational
coherence across extended interactions. Existing methods typically retrieve
persona information before response generation, which can constrain diversity
and result in generic outputs. We propose Post Persona Alignment (PPA), a novel
two-stage framework that reverses this process. PPA first generates a general
response based solely on dialogue context, then retrieves relevant persona
memories using the response as a query, and finally refines the response to
align with the speaker's persona. This post-hoc alignment strategy promotes
naturalness and diversity while preserving consistency and personalization.
Experiments on multi-session LLM-generated dialogue data demonstrate that PPA
significantly outperforms prior approaches in consistency, diversity, and
persona relevance, offering a more flexible and effective paradigm for
long-term personalized dialogue generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着上下文长度增加，大语言模型的KV缓存内存需求成为问题，现有压缩方法通常牺牲准确性或引入计算开销。

Method: 提出FourierAttention框架，利用Transformer头维度的异质性，将长上下文不敏感的维度投影到正交傅里叶基上，并设计FlashFourierAttention内核优化内存读写。

Result: 在LLaMA模型上评估，FourierAttention在LongBench和NIAH任务上实现了最佳的长上下文准确性。

Conclusion: FourierAttention在不牺牲性能的情况下，有效优化了内存需求，适用于高效部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models struggle with memory demands from the growing Key-Value
(KV) cache as context lengths increase. Existing compression methods homogenize
head dimensions or rely on attention-guided token pruning, often sacrificing
accuracy or introducing computational overhead. We propose FourierAttention, a
training-free framework that exploits the heterogeneous roles of transformer
head dimensions: lower dimensions prioritize local context, while upper ones
capture long-range dependencies. By projecting the long-context-insensitive
dimensions onto orthogonal Fourier bases, FourierAttention approximates their
temporal evolution with fixed-length spectral coefficients. Evaluations on
LLaMA models show that FourierAttention achieves the best long-context accuracy
on LongBench and Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH). Besides, a custom Triton kernel,
FlashFourierAttention, is designed to optimize memory via streamlined
read-write operations, enabling efficient deployment without performance
compromise.

Conclusion: GeistBERT为德语NLP研究提供了高性能模型，并开源以促进社区发展。

Abstract: Advances in transformer-based language models have highlighted the benefits
of language-specific pre-training on high-quality corpora. In this context,
German NLP stands to gain from updated architectures and modern datasets
tailored to the linguistic characteristics of the German language. GeistBERT
seeks to improve German language processing by incrementally training on a
diverse corpus and optimizing model performance across various NLP tasks. It
was pre-trained using fairseq with standard hyperparameters, initialized from
GottBERT weights, and trained on a large-scale German corpus using Whole Word
Masking (WWM). Based on the pre-trained model, we derived extended-input
variants using Nystr\"omformer and Longformer architectures with support for
sequences up to 8k tokens. While these long-context models were not evaluated
on dedicated long-context benchmarks, they are included in our release. We
assessed all models on NER (CoNLL 2003, GermEval 2014) and text classification
(GermEval 2018 fine/coarse, 10kGNAD) using $F_1$ score and accuracy. The
GeistBERT models achieved strong performance, leading all tasks among the base
models and setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). Notably, the base models
outperformed larger models in several tasks. To support the German NLP research
community, we are releasing GeistBERT under the MIT license.

Abstract: Counter-speech (CS) is a key strategy for mitigating online Hate Speech (HS),
yet defining the criteria to assess its effectiveness remains an open
challenge. We propose a novel computational framework for CS effectiveness
classification, grounded in social science concepts. Our framework defines six
core dimensions - Clarity, Evidence, Emotional Appeal, Rebuttal, Audience
Adaptation, and Fairness - which we use to annotate 4,214 CS instances from two
benchmark datasets, resulting in a novel linguistic resource released to the
community. In addition, we propose two classification strategies, multi-task
and dependency-based, achieving strong results (0.94 and 0.96 average F1
respectively on both expert- and user-written CS), outperforming standard
baselines, and revealing strong interdependence among dimensions.

TL;DR: 研究发现，即使在大语言模型（LLM）接收到近乎完美的外部反馈时，它们仍难以完全整合反馈并修正错误，这种现象被称为“反馈摩擦”。通过实验验证，采样策略虽能部分改善，但效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM在理想条件下整合外部反馈的能力，揭示其局限性。

Method: 设计实验环境，包括问题求解模型和基于真实答案的反馈生成器，评估模型在多任务中的表现。

Result: 即使反馈近乎完美，LLM仍表现出反馈摩擦，采样策略仅部分缓解问题。

Conclusion: 反馈摩擦是LLM的显著限制，未来研究需进一步探索其成因和解决方案。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown LLMs possess some ability to improve their
responses when given external feedback. However, it remains unclear how
effectively and thoroughly these models can incorporate extrinsic feedback. In
an ideal scenario, if LLMs receive near-perfect and complete feedback, we would
expect them to fully integrate the feedback and change their incorrect answers
to correct ones. In this paper, we systematically investigate LLMs' ability to
incorporate feedback by designing a controlled experimental environment. For
each problem, a solver model attempts a solution, then a feedback generator
with access to near-complete ground-truth answers produces targeted feedback,
after which the solver tries again. We evaluate this pipeline across a diverse
range of tasks, including math reasoning, knowledge reasoning, scientific
reasoning, and general multi-domain evaluations with state-of-the-art language
models including Claude 3.7 (with and without extended thinking). Surprisingly,
even under these near-ideal conditions, solver models consistently show
resistance to feedback, a limitation that we term FEEDBACK FRICTION. To
mitigate this limitation, we experiment with sampling-based strategies like
progressive temperature increases and explicit rejection of previously
attempted incorrect answers, which yield improvements but still fail to help
models achieve target performance. We also perform a rigorous exploration of
potential causes of FEEDBACK FRICTION, ruling out factors such as model
overconfidence and data familiarity. We hope that highlighting this issue in
LLMs and ruling out several apparent causes will help future research in
self-improvement.

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有防御方法，提升了对抗输入和嵌入空间攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LLMs的防御能力，且不影响标准性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools with profound societal
impacts, yet their ability to generate responses to diverse and uncontrolled
inputs leaves them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing defenses
often struggle to generalize across varying attack types, recent advancements
in representation engineering offer promising alternatives. In this work, we
propose a defense framework that formulates model defense as a contrastive
representation learning (CRL) problem. Our method finetunes a model using a
triplet-based loss combined with adversarial hard negative mining to encourage
separation between benign and harmful representations. Our experimental results
across multiple models demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior
representation engineering-based defenses, improving robustness against both
input-level and embedding-space attacks without compromising standard
performance. Our code is available at

Motivation: 随着LLMs的快速发展，代码生成能力正在重塑编程实践，研究旨在量化LLMs对代码风格的具体影响。

Method: 通过分析2020至2025年间19,000多个GitHub仓库的代码，结合arXiv论文数据，量化代码风格的变化趋势。

Conclusion: LLMs对现实世界的编程风格产生了可测量的影响，为未来研究提供了实证基础。

Abstract: Coding remains one of the most fundamental modes of interaction between
humans and machines. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models
(LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape
programming practices. This development prompts a central question: Have LLMs
transformed code style, and how can such transformation be characterized? In
this paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs
on code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability,
and similarity. By analyzing code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories linked
to arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends
in the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of
LLM-generated code. For instance, the proportion of snake\_case variable names
in Python code increased from 47% in Q1 2023 to 51% in Q1 2025. Furthermore, we
investigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning
processes. Given the diversity of LLMs and usage scenarios, among other
factors, it is difficult or even impossible to precisely estimate the
proportion of code generated or assisted by LLMs. Our experimental results
provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs affect real-world
programming style.

Conclusion: 该框架为图像质量不稳定的场景提供了可靠的物体检测解决方案。

Abstract: In this study, proposes a method for improved object detection from the
low-resolution images by integrating Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative
Adversarial Networks (ESRGAN) and Faster Region-Convolutional Neural Network
(Faster R-CNN). ESRGAN enhances low-quality images, restoring details and
improving clarity, while Faster R-CNN performs accurate object detection on the
enhanced images. The combination of these techniques ensures better detection
performance, even with poor-quality inputs, offering an effective solution for
applications where image resolution is in consistent. ESRGAN is employed as a
pre-processing step to enhance the low-resolution input image, effectively
restoring lost details and improving overall image quality. Subsequently, the
enhanced image is fed into the Faster R-CNN model for accurate object detection
and localization. Experimental results demonstrate that this integrated
approach yields superior performance compared to traditional methods applied
directly to low-resolution images. The proposed framework provides a promising
solution for applications where image quality is variable or limited, enabling
more robust and reliable object detection in challenging scenarios. It achieves

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提高了场景挖掘的可靠性和精度，为自动驾驶系统开发提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Scenario mining from extensive autonomous driving datasets, such as Argoverse
2, is crucial for the development and validation of self-driving systems. The
RefAV framework represents a promising approach by employing Large Language
Models (LLMs) to translate natural-language queries into executable code for
identifying relevant scenarios. However, this method faces challenges,
including runtime errors stemming from LLM-generated code and inaccuracies in
interpreting parameters for functions that describe complex multi-object
spatial relationships. This technical report introduces two key enhancements to
address these limitations: (1) a fault-tolerant iterative code-generation
mechanism that refines code by re-prompting the LLM with error feedback, and
(2) specialized prompt engineering that improves the LLM's comprehension and
correct application of spatial-relationship functions. Experiments on the
Argoverse 2 validation set with diverse LLMs-Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Gemini 2.5 Flash,
and Gemini 2.5 Pro-show consistent gains across multiple metrics; most notably,
the proposed system achieves a HOTA-Temporal score of 52.37 on the official

Result: 开发了一种能检测平滑边界物体的新方法，显著提高了尺寸测量的准确性和颗粒大小分布的分析精度。

Conclusion: 通过StarDist算法，为复杂颗粒分类和测量问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We would like to present a comprehensive study on the classification of iron
ore pellets, aimed at identifying quality violations in the final product,
alongside the development of an innovative imagebased measurement method
utilizing the StarDist algorithm, which is primarily employed in the medical
field. This initiative is motivated by the necessity to accurately identify and
analyze objects within densely packed and unstable environments. The process
involves segmenting these objects, determining their contours, classifying
them, and measuring their physical dimensions. This is crucial because the size
distribution and classification of pellets such as distinguishing between nice
(quality) and joint (caused by the presence of moisture or indicating a process
of production failure) types are among the most significant characteristics
that define the quality of the final product. Traditional algorithms, including
image classification techniques using Vision Transformer (ViT), instance
segmentation methods like Mask R-CNN, and various anomaly segmentation
algorithms, have not yielded satisfactory results in this context.
Consequently, we explored methodologies from related fields to enhance our
approach. The outcome of our research is a novel method designed to detect
objects with smoothed boundaries. This advancement significantly improves the
accuracy of physical dimension measurements and facilitates a more precise
analysis of size distribution among the iron ore pellets. By leveraging the
strengths of the StarDist algorithm, we aim to provide a robust solution that
addresses the challenges posed by the complex nature of pellet classification
and measurement.

Motivation: 提高图像分割的效率，同时避免减少模型大小，通过聚焦输入图像和可变分辨率补丁标记化实现。

Method: 提取以提示点为中心的图像裁剪，并应用可变分辨率补丁标记化，补丁的降采样率随距离提示点的增加而增加。

Result: STT在分割基准测试中表现竞争力，计算成本显著降低，可在消费级硬件上实现交互式帧率。

Conclusion: STT是一种高效且实用的图像分割工具，适用于增强现实或机器人应用。

Abstract: This paper presents Segment This Thing (STT), a new efficient image
segmentation model designed to produce a single segment given a single point
prompt. Instead of following prior work and increasing efficiency by decreasing
model size, we gain efficiency by foveating input images. Given an image and a
point prompt, we extract a crop centered on the prompt and apply a novel
variable-resolution patch tokenization in which patches are downsampled at a
rate that increases with increased distance from the prompt. This approach
yields far fewer image tokens than uniform patch tokenization. As a result we
can drastically reduce the computational cost of segmentation without reducing
model size. Furthermore, the foveation focuses the model on the region of
interest, a potentially useful inductive bias. We show that our Segment This
Thing model is more efficient than prior work while remaining competitive on
segmentation benchmarks. It can easily run at interactive frame rates on
consumer hardware and is thus a promising tool for augmented reality or
robotics applications.

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于机器学习和深度学习的自动疼痛检测模型在性别公平性上的表现，发现所有模型均存在性别偏见，Vision Transformer（ViT）表现最佳但仍需改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动疼痛检测在医疗中有重要应用，但其算法在不同人口群体（如性别）中的准确性和公平性研究不足。

Method: 使用UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database，比较传统ML（L SVM、RBF SVM）和DL（CNN、ViT）模型在面部表情疼痛检测中的表现和公平性。

Result: ViT在准确性和部分公平性指标上表现最佳，但所有模型均显示性别偏见。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了准确性与公平性之间的权衡，强调了在自动医疗系统中采用公平性技术以减少偏见的必要性。

Abstract: Automated pain detection through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)
algorithms holds significant potential in healthcare, particularly for patients
unable to self-report pain levels. However, the accuracy and fairness of these
algorithms across different demographic groups (e.g., gender) remain
under-researched. This paper investigates the gender fairness of ML and DL
models trained on the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database,
evaluating the performance of various models in detecting pain based solely on
the visual modality of participants' facial expressions. We compare traditional
ML algorithms, Linear Support Vector Machine (L SVM) and Radial Basis Function
SVM (RBF SVM), with DL methods, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT), using a range of performance and fairness metrics. While ViT
achieved the highest accuracy and a selection of fairness metrics, all models
exhibited gender-based biases. These findings highlight the persistent
trade-off between accuracy and fairness, emphasising the need for
fairness-aware techniques to mitigate biases in automated healthcare systems.

Motivation: 解决单张彩色图像中3D手部关节估计的挑战，如深度信息缺失、遮挡和复杂关节。

Method: 采用关键点对齐步骤和指尖损失，避免依赖相机参数。

Result: 在EgoDexter和Dexter+Object基准测试中表现优异，对“野外”图像鲁棒。

Conclusion: 方法在无需相机参数的情况下表现良好，但2D关键点估计精度仍敏感。

Abstract: Estimating the 3D hand articulation from a single color image is a
continuously investigated problem with applications in Augmented Reality (AR),
Virtual Reality (VR), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and robotics. Apart
from the absence of depth information, occlusions, articulation complexity, and
the need for camera parameters knowledge pose additional challenges. In this
work, we propose an optimization pipeline for estimating the 3D hand
articulation from 2D keypoint input, which includes a keypoint alignment step
and a fingertip loss to overcome the need to know or estimate the camera
parameters. We evaluate our approach on the EgoDexter and Dexter+Object
benchmarks to showcase that our approach performs competitively with the SotA,
while also demonstrating its robustness when processing "in-the-wild" images
without any prior camera knowledge. Our quantitative analysis highlights the
sensitivity of the 2D keypoint estimation accuracy, despite the use of hand
priors. Code is available at https://github.com/cpantazop/HandRepo

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的损失函数ContextLoss（CLoss），通过考虑关键像素掩码中的拓扑错误及其上下文，提高了图像分割的拓扑正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在图像分割中，保持分割结构（如血管、膜或道路）的拓扑结构至关重要，因为拓扑错误（如道路网络中的错误）可能严重影响导航。

Method: 提出了CLoss损失函数，利用关键像素掩码中的上下文信息来改进拓扑正确性，并提出了两种直观的指标验证连通性改进。

Result: 在三个公共数据集和自有的3D纳米成像数据集上验证，CLoss在拓扑感知指标上表现更优，修复了比其他方法多44%的缺失连接。

Conclusion: CLoss显著提升了拓扑正确性，代码已公开。

Abstract: In image segmentation, preserving the topology of segmented structures like
vessels, membranes, or roads is crucial. For instance, topological errors on
road networks can significantly impact navigation. Recently proposed solutions
are loss functions based on critical pixel masks that consider the whole
skeleton of the segmented structures in the critical pixel mask. We propose the
novel loss function ContextLoss (CLoss) that improves topological correctness
by considering topological errors with their whole context in the critical
pixel mask. The additional context improves the network focus on the
topological errors. Further, we propose two intuitive metrics to verify
improved connectivity due to a closing of missed connections. We benchmark our
proposed CLoss on three public datasets (2D & 3D) and our own 3D nano-imaging
dataset of bone cement lines. Training with our proposed CLoss increases
performance on topology-aware metrics and repairs up to 44% more missed
connections than other state-of-the-art methods. We make the code publicly
available.

TL;DR: JAFAR是一种轻量级、灵活的特征上采样器，通过注意力模块提升视觉特征的空间分辨率，无需高分辨率监督即可泛化到更高输出尺度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础视觉编码器的低分辨率空间特征输出需要上采样以满足下游任务的高分辨率需求。

Method: JAFAR采用基于注意力的模块，结合空间特征变换（SFT）调制，促进高分辨率查询与低分辨率语义丰富键的对齐。

Result: 实验表明，JAFAR能有效恢复细粒度空间细节，并在多种下游任务中优于现有上采样方法。

Conclusion: JAFAR是一种高效的特征上采样解决方案，适用于多种视觉任务。

Abstract: Foundation Vision Encoders have become essential for a wide range of dense
vision tasks. However, their low-resolution spatial feature outputs necessitate
feature upsampling to produce the high-resolution modalities required for
downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce JAFAR, a lightweight and flexible
feature upsampler that enhances the spatial resolution of visual features from
any Foundation Vision Encoder to an arbitrary target resolution. JAFAR employs
an attention-based module designed to promote semantic alignment between
high-resolution queries, derived from low-level image features, and
semantically enriched low-resolution keys, using Spatial Feature Transform
(SFT) modulation. Notably, despite the absence of high-resolution supervision,
we demonstrate that learning at low upsampling ratios and resolutions
generalizes remarkably well to significantly higher output scales. Extensive
experiments show that JAFAR effectively recovers fine-grained spatial details
and consistently outperforms existing feature upsampling methods across a
diverse set of downstream tasks. Project page at

Abstract: Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems leveraging Large Language Models
(LLMs) exhibit significant potential for complex reasoning, planning, and tool
utilization. We demonstrate that a specialized computer vision system can be
built autonomously from a natural language prompt using Agentic AI methods.
This involved extending SimpleMind (SM), an open-source Cognitive AI
environment with configurable tools for medical image analysis, with an
LLM-based agent, implemented using OpenManus, to automate the planning (tool
configuration) for a particular computer vision task. We provide a
proof-of-concept demonstration that an agentic system can interpret a computer
vision task prompt, plan a corresponding SimpleMind workflow by decomposing the
task and configuring appropriate tools. From the user input prompt, "provide sm
(SimpleMind) config for lungs, heart, and ribs segmentation for cxr (chest
x-ray)"), the agent LLM was able to generate the plan (tool configuration file
in YAML format), and execute SM-Learn (training) and SM-Think (inference)
scripts autonomously. The computer vision agent automatically configured,
trained, and tested itself on 50 chest x-ray images, achieving mean dice scores
of 0.96, 0.82, 0.83, for lungs, heart, and ribs, respectively. This work shows
the potential for autonomous planning and tool configuration that has
traditionally been performed by a data scientist in the development of computer

Motivation: 解决当前半监督语义分割方法在伪标签利用、类别不平衡和预测不确定性方面的不足。

Method: 采用模糊伪标签保留软类别分布，通过熵基可靠性分数动态加权像素贡献，自适应调整损失以平衡类别分布，并引入轻量级对比正则化优化特征嵌入。

Result: 在基准测试中显著优于现有方法，特别是在少数类和模糊区域的划分上表现突出。

Conclusion: 该框架通过将不确定性转化为学习资源，有效提升了半监督语义分割的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) faces persistent challenges in
effectively leveraging unlabeled data, such as ineffective utilization of
pseudo-labels, exacerbation of class imbalance biases, and neglect of
prediction uncertainty. Current approaches often discard uncertain regions
through strict thresholding favouring dominant classes. To address these
limitations, we introduce a holistic framework that transforms uncertainty into
a learning asset through four principal components: (1) fuzzy pseudo-labeling,
which preserves soft class distributions from top-K predictions to enrich
supervision; (2) uncertainty-aware dynamic weighting, that modulate pixel-wise
contributions via entropy-based reliability scores; (3) adaptive class
rebalancing, which dynamically adjust losses to counteract long-tailed class
distributions; and (4) lightweight contrastive regularization, that encourage
compact and discriminative feature embeddings. Extensive experiments on
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving significant improvements in the segmentation of
under-represented classes and ambiguous regions.

Result: 实验表明AlignHuman显著提升了基线性能，减少了推理时的NFEs（从100降至30），速度提升3.3倍且生成质量影响极小。

Conclusion: AlignHuman通过时间步分段优化和专家对齐模块，有效平衡了运动自然性与视觉保真度，为高效人类动画生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in human video generation and animation tasks, driven by
diffusion models, have achieved significant progress. However, expressive and
realistic human animation remains challenging due to the trade-off between
motion naturalness and visual fidelity. To address this, we propose
\textbf{AlignHuman}, a framework that combines Preference Optimization as a
post-training technique with a divide-and-conquer training strategy to jointly
optimize these competing objectives. Our key insight stems from an analysis of
the denoising process across timesteps: (1) early denoising timesteps primarily
control motion dynamics, while (2) fidelity and human structure can be
effectively managed by later timesteps, even if early steps are skipped.
Building on this observation, we propose timestep-segment preference
optimization (TPO) and introduce two specialized LoRAs as expert alignment
modules, each targeting a specific dimension in its corresponding timestep
interval. The LoRAs are trained using their respective preference data and
activated in the corresponding intervals during inference to enhance motion
naturalness and fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignHuman
improves strong baselines and reduces NFEs during inference, achieving a
3.3$\times$ speedup (from 100 NFEs to 30 NFEs) with minimal impact on
generation quality. Homepage:

Abstract: The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large
language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the landscape of digital content
creation in different modalities. However, its potential use in Physical AI for
engineering design, where the production of physically viable artifacts is
paramount, remains vastly underexplored. The absence of physical knowledge in
existing LLM-to-3D models often results in outputs detached from real-world
physical constraints. To address this gap, we introduce LLM-to-Phy3D, a
physically conform online 3D object generation that enables existing LLM-to-3D
models to produce physically conforming 3D objects on the fly. LLM-to-Phy3D
introduces a novel online black-box refinement loop that empowers large
language models (LLMs) through synergistic visual and physics-based
evaluations. By delivering directional feedback in an iterative refinement
process, LLM-to-Phy3D actively drives the discovery of prompts that yield 3D
artifacts with enhanced physical performance and greater geometric novelty
relative to reference objects, marking a substantial contribution to AI-driven
generative design. Systematic evaluations of LLM-to-Phy3D, supported by
ablation studies in vehicle design optimization, reveal various LLM
improvements gained by 4.5% to 106.7% in producing physically conform target
domain 3D designs over conventional LLM-to-3D models. The encouraging results
suggest the potential general use of LLM-to-Phy3D in Physical AI for scientific

Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering a mental target (e.g., an image of a

that learns to recover unknown mental targets without access to labeled data or
pre-trained decoders. Our experiments on naturalistic images of faces
demonstrate that CURSOR can (1) predict image similarity scores that correlate
with human perceptual judgments without any label information, (2) use these
scores to rank stimuli against an unknown mental target, and (3) generate new
stimuli indistinguishable from the unknown mental target (validated via a user
study, N=53).

Abstract: Video captioning can be used to assess the video understanding capabilities
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks and
evaluation protocols suffer from crucial issues, such as inadequate or
homogeneous creation of key points, exorbitant cost of data creation, and
limited evaluation scopes. To address these issues, we propose an automatic
framework, named AutoCaption, which leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
construct numerous and diverse descriptive sentences (\textit{i.e.}, key
points) that thoroughly represent video content in an iterative way. This
iterative captioning strategy enables the continuous enhancement of video
details such as actions, objects' attributes, environment details, etc. We
apply AutoCaption to curate MCTS-VCB, a fine-grained video caption benchmark
covering video details, thereby enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs on
the video captioning task. We evaluate more than 20 open- and closed-source
MLLMs of varying sizes on MCTS-VCB. Results show that MCTS-VCB can effectively
and comprehensively evaluate the video captioning capability, with
Gemini-1.5-Pro achieving the highest F1 score of 71.2. Interestingly, we
fine-tune InternVL2.5-8B with the AutoCaption-generated data, which helps the
model achieve an overall improvement of 25.0% on MCTS-VCB and 16.3% on
DREAM-1K, further demonstrating the effectiveness of AutoCaption. The code and

ambiguities. A comparative analysis of different OCR tools is presented to
evaluate their effectiveness concerning accuracy, layout recognition, and
processing speed. The approach demonstrates significant improvements over
traditional rule-based and template-based methods, offering enhanced
flexibility and semantic precision across different document categories

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解人类社交行为（如情绪识别和社交动态）是一个重要但具挑战性的问题，现有LLMs局限于文本领域，无法处理非语言线索。

Method: 提出视觉社会-语用推理任务，构建高质量数据集，并测试多个VLMs的性能。

Result: 发现VLMs在视觉社会-语用推理方面存在显著差距。

Conclusion: VLMs在社交推理中仍有局限，需进一步研究以填补这一差距。

Abstract: Understanding human social behavior such as recognizing emotions and the
social dynamics causing them is an important and challenging problem. While
LLMs have made remarkable advances, they are limited to the textual domain and
cannot account for the major role that non-verbal cues play in understanding
social situations. Vision Language Models (VLMs) can potentially account for
this gap, however their ability to make correct inferences over such social
cues has received little attention. In this paper, we explore the capabilities
of VLMs at social reasoning. We identify a previously overlooked limitation in
VLMs: the Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference gap. To target this gap, we propose
a new task for VLMs: Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference. We construct a high
quality dataset to test the abilities of a VLM for this task and benchmark the
performance of several VLMs on it.

Abstract: Visualizing the first few kilometers of the Earth's subsurface, a
long-standing challenge gating a virtually inexhaustible list of important
applications, is coming within reach through deep learning. Building on
techniques of generative artificial intelligence applied to voxelated images,
we demonstrate a method that extends surface geological data supplemented by
boreholes to a three-dimensional subsurface region by training a neural
network. The Earth's land area having been extensively mapped for geological
features, the bottleneck of this or any related technique is the availability
of data below the surface. We close this data gap in the development of
subsurface deep learning by designing a synthetic data-generator process that
mimics eons of geological activity such as sediment compaction, volcanic
intrusion, and tectonic dynamics to produce a virtually limitless number of
samples of the near lithosphere. A foundation model trained on such synthetic
data is able to generate a 3D image of the subsurface from a previously unseen
map of surface topography and geology, showing increasing fidelity with
increasing access to borehole data, depicting such structures as layers,
faults, folds, dikes, and sills. We illustrate the early promise of the
combination of a synthetic lithospheric generator with a trained neural network
model using generative flow matching. Ultimately, such models will be
fine-tuned on data from applicable campaigns, such as mineral prospecting in a
given region. Though useful in itself, a regionally fine-tuned models may be
employed not as an end but as a means: as an AI-based regularizer in a more
traditional inverse problem application, in which the objective function
represents the mismatch of additional data with physical models with
applications in resource exploration, hazard assessment, and geotechnical
engineering.

Abstract: This paper compares the performance of BiLSTM and CNN+GRU deep learning
models for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on two WiFi-based Channel State
Information (CSI) datasets: UT-HAR and NTU-Fi HAR. The findings indicate that
the CNN+GRU model has a higher accuracy on the UT-HAR dataset (95.20%) thanks
to its ability to extract spatial features. In contrast, the BiLSTM model
performs better on the high-resolution NTU-Fi HAR dataset (92.05%) by
extracting long-term temporal dependencies more effectively. The findings
strongly emphasize the critical role of dataset characteristics and
preprocessing techniques in model performance improvement. We also show the
real-world applicability of such models in applications like healthcare and

Result: 在多种医学影像模态中验证了方法的有效性，提高了诊断准确性和分类可靠性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过无偏提示和测试时缩放，显著提升了大语言模型在医学影像诊断中的表现。

Abstract: As a cornerstone of patient care, clinical decision-making significantly
influences patient outcomes and can be enhanced by large language models
(LLMs). Although LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance, their
application to visual question answering in medical imaging, particularly for
reasoning-based diagnosis, remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, supervised
fine-tuning for reasoning tasks is largely impractical due to limited data
availability and high annotation costs. In this work, we introduce a zero-shot
framework for reliable medical image diagnosis that enhances the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs in clinical settings through test-time scaling. Given a
medical image and a textual prompt, a vision-language model processes a medical
image along with a corresponding textual prompt to generate multiple
descriptions or interpretations of visual features. These interpretations are
then fed to an LLM, where a test-time scaling strategy consolidates multiple
candidate outputs into a reliable final diagnosis. We evaluate our approach
across various medical imaging modalities -- including radiology,
ophthalmology, and histopathology -- and demonstrate that the proposed
test-time scaling strategy enhances diagnostic accuracy for both our and
baseline methods. Additionally, we provide an empirical analysis showing that
the proposed approach, which allows unbiased prompting in the first stage,
improves the reliability of LLM-generated diagnoses and enhances classification
accuracy.

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is essential for studying brain
function and diagnosing neurological disorders, but current analysis methods
face reproducibility and transferability issues due to complex pre-processing
and task-specific models. We introduce NeuroSTORM (Neuroimaging Foundation
Model with Spatial-Temporal Optimized Representation Modeling), a generalizable
framework that directly learns from 4D fMRI volumes and enables efficient
knowledge transfer across diverse applications. NeuroSTORM is pre-trained on
28.65 million fMRI frames (>9,000 hours) from over 50,000 subjects across
multiple centers and ages 5 to 100. Using a Mamba backbone and a shifted
scanning strategy, it efficiently processes full 4D volumes. We also propose a
spatial-temporal optimized pre-training approach and task-specific prompt
tuning to improve transferability. NeuroSTORM outperforms existing methods
across five tasks: age/gender prediction, phenotype prediction, disease
diagnosis, fMRI-to-image retrieval, and task-based fMRI classification. It
demonstrates strong clinical utility on datasets from hospitals in the U.S.,
South Korea, and Australia, achieving top performance in disease diagnosis and
cognitive phenotype prediction. NeuroSTORM provides a standardized, open-source
foundation model to improve reproducibility and transferability in fMRI-based
clinical research.

Conclusion: WaveFormer在轻量化和高效性上表现优异，为嵌入式系统的sEMG手势识别提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Human-machine interaction, particularly in prosthetic and robotic control,
has seen progress with gesture recognition via surface electromyographic (sEMG)
signals.However, classifying similar gestures that produce nearly identical
muscle signals remains a challenge, often reducing classification accuracy.
Traditional deep learning models for sEMG gesture recognition are large and
computationally expensive, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained
embedded systems. In this work, we propose WaveFormer, a lightweight
transformer-based architecture tailored for sEMG gesture recognition. Our model
integrates time-domain and frequency-domain features through a novel learnable
wavelet transform, enhancing feature extraction. In particular, the WaveletConv
module, a multi-level wavelet decomposition layer with depthwise separable
convolution, ensures both efficiency and compactness. With just 3.1 million
parameters, WaveFormer achieves 95% classification accuracy on the EPN612
dataset, outperforming larger models. Furthermore, when profiled on a laptop
equipped with an Intel CPU, INT8 quantization achieves real-time deployment
with a 6.75 ms inference latency.

Result: 实验表明SF-TMAT在恶劣场景下的无人机目标检测中表现出优越性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: SF-TMAT为恶劣条件下的无人机目标检测提供了有效解决方案，并通过动态调整策略提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has shown promise in effectively
alleviating the performance degradation caused by domain gaps between source
and target domains, and it can potentially be generalized to UAV object
detection in adverse scenes. However, existing UDA studies are based on natural
images or clear UAV imagery, and research focused on UAV imagery in adverse
conditions is still in its infancy. Moreover, due to the unique perspective of
UAVs and the interference from adverse conditions, these methods often fail to
accurately align features and are influenced by limited or noisy pseudo-labels.
To address this, we propose the first benchmark for UAV object detection in
adverse scenes, the Statistical Feedback-Driven Threshold and Mask Adjustment
Teacher-Student Framework (SF-TMAT). Specifically, SF-TMAT introduces a design
called Dynamic Step Feedback Mask Adjustment Autoencoder (DSFMA), which
dynamically adjusts the mask ratio and reconstructs feature maps by integrating
training progress and loss feedback. This approach dynamically adjusts the
learning focus at different training stages to meet the model's needs for
learning features at varying levels of granularity. Additionally, we propose a
unique Variance Feedback Smoothing Threshold (VFST) strategy, which
statistically computes the mean confidence of each class and dynamically
adjusts the selection threshold by incorporating a variance penalty term. This
strategy improves the quality of pseudo-labels and uncovers potentially valid
labels, thus mitigating domain bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority and generalization capability of the proposed SF-TMAT in UAV object
detection under adverse scene conditions. The Code is released at
https://github.com/ChenHuyoo .

Motivation: 现有图学习方法难以定位神经退行性疾病相关的特定脑区，且多模态脑图模型计算复杂度高，限制了实际应用。

Result: 实验表明，BrainMAP在计算效率上优于现有方法，且预测准确性未受影响。

Conclusion: BrainMAP为神经退行性疾病的精准高效检测提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in research focused on leveraging graph
learning techniques to detect neurodegenerative diseases. However, existing
graph-based approaches typically lack the ability to localize and extract the
specific brain regions driving neurodegenerative pathology within the full
connectome. Additionally, recent works on multimodal brain graph models often
suffer from high computational complexity, limiting their practical use in
resource-constrained devices. In this study, we present BrainMAP, a novel
multimodal graph learning framework designed for precise and computationally
efficient identification of brain regions affected by neurodegenerative
diseases. First, BrainMAP utilizes an atlas-driven filtering approach guided by
the AAL atlas to pinpoint and extract critical brain subgraphs. Unlike recent
state-of-the-art methods, which model the entire brain network, BrainMAP
achieves more than 50% reduction in computational overhead by concentrating on
disease-relevant subgraphs. Second, we employ an advanced multimodal fusion
process comprising cross-node attention to align functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, coupled with an
adaptive gating mechanism to blend and integrate these modalities dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that BrainMAP outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in computational efficiency, without compromising predictive accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于YOLOv11的改进模型，用于提高车辆速度检测的准确性，并能够识别车道和分类车辆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加州车辆数量增加，交通系统不足和测速摄像头稀疏，需要有效的车辆速度检测方法。

Method: 使用改进的YOLOv11模型，训练800张鸟瞰图，识别车道并分类车辆为两类（轿车和重型车辆）。

Result: 模型在MAE和MSE上表现优异（0.97 mph和0.94 mph²），验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 改进的YOLOv11模型在车辆速度检测和分类中表现出色，适用于交通监控和法规执行。

Abstract: The increase in vehicle numbers in California, driven by inadequate
transportation systems and sparse speed cameras, necessitates effective vehicle
speed detection. Detecting vehicle speeds per lane is critical for monitoring
High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane speeds, distinguishing between cars and heavy
vehicles with differing speed limits, and enforcing lane restrictions for heavy
vehicles. While prior works utilized YOLO (You Only Look Once) for vehicle
speed detection, they often lacked accuracy, failed to identify vehicle lanes,
and offered limited or less practical classification categories. This study
introduces a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model, trained on almost 800 bird's-eye view
images, to enhance vehicle speed detection accuracy which is much higher
compare to the previous works. The proposed system identifies the lane for each
vehicle and classifies vehicles into two categories: cars and heavy vehicles.
Designed to meet the specific requirements of traffic monitoring and
regulation, the model also evaluates the effects of factors such as drone
height, distance of Region of Interest (ROI), and vehicle speed on detection
accuracy and speed measurement. Drone footage collected from Northern
California was used to assess the proposed system. The fine-tuned YOLOv11
achieved its best performance with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.97 mph and
mean squared error (MSE) of 0.94 $\text{mph}^2$, demonstrating its efficacy in
addressing challenges in vehicle speed detection and classification.

Conclusion: 知识追踪机器遗忘是基础模型遗忘的更优解决方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning removes certain training data points and their influence
on AI models (e.g., when a data owner revokes their decision to allow models to
learn from the data). In this position paper, we propose to lift data-tracing
machine unlearning to knowledge-tracing for foundation models (FMs). We support
this position based on practical needs and insights from cognitive studies.
Practically, tracing data cannot meet the diverse unlearning requests for FMs,
which may be from regulators, enterprise users, product teams, etc., having no
access to FMs' massive training data. Instead, it is convenient for these
parties to issue an unlearning request about the knowledge or capability FMs
(should not) possess. Cognitively, knowledge-tracing unlearning aligns with how
the human brain forgets more closely than tracing individual training data
points. Finally, we provide a concrete case study about a vision-language FM to
illustrate how an unlearner might instantiate the knowledge-tracing machine
unlearning paradigm.

Abstract: World models aim to simulate environments and enable effective agent

as they dynamically change across both space and, crucially, time. To capture
these composed dynamics, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal Road Image Dataset for
Exploration (STRIDE) permuting 360-degree panoramic imagery into rich
interconnected observation, state and action nodes. Leveraging this structure,
we can simultaneously model the relationship between egocentric views,
positional coordinates, and movement commands across both space and time. We
benchmark this dataset via TARDIS, a transformer-based generative world model
that integrates spatial and temporal dynamics through a unified autoregressive
framework trained on STRIDE. We demonstrate robust performance across a range
of agentic tasks such as controllable photorealistic image synthesis,
instruction following, autonomous self-control, and state-of-the-art
georeferencing. These results suggest a promising direction towards
sophisticated generalist agents--capable of understanding and manipulating the
spatial and temporal aspects of their material environments--with enhanced
embodied reasoning capabilities. Training code, datasets, and model checkpoints

Conclusion: 该数据集有助于Geo-FMs的开发与评估，并促进地理偏差和泛化能力的研究。

Abstract: Comprehensive evaluation of geospatial foundation models (Geo-FMs) requires
benchmarking across diverse tasks, sensors, and geographic regions. However,
most existing benchmark datasets are limited to segmentation or classification
tasks, and focus on specific geographic areas. To address this gap, we
introduce a globally distributed dataset for forest aboveground biomass (AGB)
estimation, a pixel-wise regression task. This benchmark dataset combines
co-located hyperspectral imagery (HSI) from the Environmental Mapping and
Analysis Program (EnMAP) satellite and predictions of AGB density estimates
derived from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation lidars, covering seven
continental regions. Our experimental results on this dataset demonstrate that
the evaluated Geo-FMs can match or, in some cases, surpass the performance of a
baseline U-Net, especially when fine-tuning the encoder. We also find that the
performance difference between the U-Net and Geo-FMs depends on the dataset
size for each region and highlight the importance of the token patch size in
the Vision Transformer backbone for accurate predictions in pixel-wise
regression tasks. By releasing this globally distributed hyperspectral
benchmark dataset, we aim to facilitate the development and evaluation of
Geo-FMs for HSI applications. Leveraging this dataset additionally enables
research into geographic bias and generalization capacity of Geo-FMs. The
dataset and source code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: GynSurg的公开发布将加速妇科腹腔镜手术领域的研究进展。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have transformed computer-assisted
intervention and surgical video analysis, driving improvements not only in
surgical training, intraoperative decision support, and patient outcomes, but
also in postoperative documentation and surgical discovery. Central to these
developments is the availability of large, high-quality annotated datasets. In
gynecologic laparoscopy, surgical scene understanding and action recognition
are fundamental for building intelligent systems that assist surgeons during
operations and provide deeper analysis after surgery. However, existing
datasets are often limited by small scale, narrow task focus, or insufficiently
detailed annotations, limiting their utility for comprehensive, end-to-end
workflow analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce GynSurg, the
largest and most diverse multi-task dataset for gynecologic laparoscopic
surgery to date. GynSurg provides rich annotations across multiple tasks,
supporting applications in action recognition, semantic segmentation, surgical
documentation, and discovery of novel procedural insights. We demonstrate the
dataset quality and versatility by benchmarking state-of-the-art models under a
standardized training protocol. To accelerate progress in the field, we
publicly release the GynSurg dataset and its annotations

Motivation: 图像生成模型的快速发展带来了滥用风险（如深度伪造、钓鱼攻击等），需要有效的真实性验证机制。传统水印方法因重标记不匹配问题难以直接应用。

Method: 提出C-reweight方法，通过基于聚类的策略等效处理同一簇内的标记，解决重标记不匹配问题。

Result: 在主流图像生成平台上的评估表明，C-reweight在保持图像质量的同时，提高了水印的可检测性。

Conclusion: C-reweight为安全可靠的图像合成设定了新标准。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of image generation models has revolutionized visual
content creation, enabling the synthesis of highly realistic and contextually
accurate images for diverse applications. However, the potential for misuse,
such as deepfake generation, image based phishing attacks, and fabrication of
misleading visual evidence, underscores the need for robust authenticity
verification mechanisms. While traditional statistical watermarking techniques
have proven effective for autoregressive language models, their direct
adaptation to image generation models encounters significant challenges due to
a phenomenon we term retokenization mismatch, a disparity between original and
retokenized sequences during the image generation process. To overcome this
limitation, we propose C-reweight, a novel, distortion-free watermarking method
explicitly designed for image generation models. By leveraging a
clustering-based strategy that treats tokens within the same cluster
equivalently, C-reweight mitigates retokenization mismatch while preserving
image fidelity. Extensive evaluations on leading image generation platforms
reveal that C-reweight not only maintains the visual quality of generated
images but also improves detectability over existing distortion-free
watermarking techniques, setting a new standard for secure and trustworthy
image synthesis.

Abstract: Subspace clustering has become widely adopted for the unsupervised analysis

methods often use a two-stage framework, involving the calculation of a
self-representation matrix with complexity of O(n^2), followed by spectral
clustering. However, these methods are computationally intensive, generally
incorporating solely either local or non-local spatial structure constraints,
and their structural constraints fall short of effectively supervising the
entire clustering process.
  We propose a scalable, context-preserving deep clustering method based on
basis representation, which jointly captures local and non-local structures for
efficient HSI clustering. To preserve local structure (i.e., spatial continuity
within subspaces), we introduce a spatial smoothness constraint that aligns
clustering predictions with their spatially filtered versions. For non-local
structure (i.e., spectral continuity), we employ a mini-cluster-based scheme
that refines predictions at the group level, encouraging spectrally similar
pixels to belong to the same subspace. Notably, these two constraints are
jointly optimized to reinforce each other.
  Specifically, our model is designed as an one-stage approach in which the
structural constraints are applied to the entire clustering process. The time
and space complexity of our method is O(n), making it applicable to large-scale
HSI data. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art techniques. Our code is available at:

Abstract: People get informed of a daily task plan through diverse media involving both
texts and images. However, most prior research only focuses on LLM's capability
of textual plan generation. The potential of large-scale models in providing
text-image plans remains understudied. Generating high-quality text-image plans
faces two main challenges: ensuring consistent alignment between two modalities
and keeping coherence among visual steps. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework that generates and refines text-image plans
step-by-step. At each iteration, our framework (1) drafts the next textual step
based on the prediction history; (2) edits the last visual step to obtain the
next one; (3) extracts PDDL-like visual information; and (4) refines the draft
with the extracted visual information. The textual and visual step produced in
stage (4) and (2) will then serve as inputs for the next iteration. Our
approach offers a plug-and-play improvement to various backbone models, such as
Mistral-7B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4o. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we collect a new benchmark consisting of 1,100 tasks and their
text-image pair solutions covering 11 daily topics. We also design and validate
a new set of metrics to evaluate the multimodal consistency and coherence in
text-image plans. Extensive experiment results show the effectiveness of our
approach on a range of backbone models against competitive baselines. Our code
and data are available at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/MPlanner.

Motivation: 现有方法在复杂推理场景中表现不佳，主要由于跨模态交互不足和实体空间关系捕捉能力有限。

Method: 采用动态双向空间塔结构，分为四层模拟人类格式塔视觉原理，提供结构化先验，提升感知单元的组织能力。

Result: 实验表明该模块可应用于任何多模态模型，并在空间关系问答数据集上达到先进水平。模型July仅用3B参数即实现SOTA。

Conclusion: 动态双向空间塔结构显著提升了模型的空间关系处理能力，为视觉问答任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: The Visual Question Answering (VQA) task requires the simultaneous
understanding of image content and question semantics. However, existing
methods often have difficulty handling complex reasoning scenarios due to
insufficient cross-modal interaction and capturing the entity spatial
relationships in the
image.\cite{huang2023adaptive}\cite{liu2021comparing}\cite{guibas2021adaptive}\cite{zhang2022vsa}We
studied a brand-new approach to replace the attention mechanism in order to
enhance the reasoning ability of the model and its understanding of spatial
relationships.Specifically, we propose a dynamic bidirectional spatial tower,
which is divided into four layers to observe the image according to the
principle of human gestalt vision. This naturally provides a powerful
structural prior for the spatial organization between entities, enabling the
model to no longer blindly search for relationships between pixels but make
judgments based on more meaningful perceptual units. Change from "seeing
images" to "perceiving and organizing image content".A large number of
experiments have shown that our module can be used in any other multimodal
model and achieve advanced results, demonstrating its potential in spatial
relationship processing.Meanwhile, the multimodal visual question-answering
model July trained by our method has achieved state-of-the-art results with
only 3B parameters, especially on the question-answering dataset of spatial
relations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种偏好学习方法（\mymethod\），通过针对幻觉发生的区域进行优化，减少多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉语言任务中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在视觉语言任务中常生成输入图像中不存在的对象信息（幻觉），影响模型在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: 构建包含幻觉响应、正确响应和目标信息的数据集，应用偏好学习方法针对特定目标区域优化，过滤无关信号。

Result: 实验表明，该方法有效减少了幻觉问题，提升了MLLMs的可靠性和性能。

Conclusion: \mymethod\ 通过聚焦相关区域，显著减少了幻觉问题，同时保持了模型的整体性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently suffer from hallucination
issues, generating information about objects that are not present in input
images during vision-language tasks. These hallucinations particularly
undermine model reliability in practical applications requiring accurate object
identification. To address this challenge, we propose \mymethod,\ a preference
learning approach that mitigates hallucinations by focusing on targeted areas
where they occur. To implement this, we build a dataset containing hallucinated
responses, correct responses, and target information (i.e., objects present in
the images and the corresponding chunk positions in responses affected by
hallucinations). By applying a preference learning method restricted to these
specific targets, the model can filter out irrelevant signals and focus on
correcting hallucinations. This allows the model to produce more factual
responses by concentrating solely on relevant information. Experimental results
demonstrate that \mymethod\ effectively reduces hallucinations across multiple
vision hallucination tasks, improving the reliability and performance of MLLMs
without diminishing overall performance.

TL;DR: Auto-Connect是一种自动骨骼绑定新方法，通过连接保留标记化方案和拓扑感知奖励函数，显著提升骨骼结构的拓扑准确性和变形质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在预测骨骼位置时忽略连接性，导致拓扑不准确。Auto-Connect旨在通过直接整合连接信息，生成更符合解剖学的骨骼结构。

Method: 采用连接保留标记化方案定义关节端点，结合拓扑感知奖励函数和隐式测地线特征进行骨骼选择和后训练优化。

Result: 模型能够生成拓扑更准确、变形性能更优的骨骼结构，有效减少皮肤绑定中的常见伪影。

Conclusion: Auto-Connect通过综合连接性、拓扑优化和测地线特征，显著提升了自动骨骼绑定的质量和实用性。

Abstract: We introduce Auto-Connect, a novel approach for automatic rigging that
explicitly preserves skeletal connectivity through a connectivity-preserving
tokenization scheme. Unlike previous methods that predict bone positions
represented as two joints or first predict points before determining
connectivity, our method employs special tokens to define endpoints for each
joint's children and for each hierarchical layer, effectively automating
connectivity relationships. This approach significantly enhances topological
accuracy by integrating connectivity information directly into the prediction
framework. To further guarantee high-quality topology, we implement a
topology-aware reward function that quantifies topological correctness, which
is then utilized in a post-training phase through reward-guided Direct
Preference Optimization. Additionally, we incorporate implicit geodesic
features for latent top-k bone selection, which substantially improves skinning
quality. By leveraging geodesic distance information within the model's latent
space, our approach intelligently determines the most influential bones for
each vertex, effectively mitigating common skinning artifacts. This combination
of connectivity-preserving tokenization, reward-guided fine-tuning, and
geodesic-aware bone selection enables our model to consistently generate more
anatomically plausible skeletal structures with superior deformation
properties.

Conclusion: FSCA在现实应用中具有强大的审计潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion model since its propose has significantly influenced
the content creation due to its impressive generation capability. However, this
capability depends on large-scale text-image datasets gathered from web
platforms like social media, posing substantial challenges in copyright
compliance and personal privacy leakage. Though there are some efforts devoted
to explore approaches for auditing data provenance in text-to-image diffusion
models, existing work has unrealistic assumptions that can obtain model
internal knowledge, e.g., intermediate results, or the evaluation is not
reliable. To fill this gap, we propose a completely black-box auditing
framework called Feature Semantic Consistency-based Auditing (FSCA). It
utilizes two types of semantic connections within the text-to-image diffusion
model for auditing, eliminating the need for access to internal knowledge. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of our FSCA framework, we perform extensive
experiments on LAION-mi dataset and COCO dataset, and compare with eight
state-of-the-art baseline approaches. The results show that FSCA surpasses
previous baseline approaches across various metrics and different data
distributions, showcasing the superiority of our FSCA. Moreover, we introduce a
recall balance strategy and a threshold adjustment strategy, which collectively
allows FSCA to reach up a user-level accuracy of 90% in a real-world auditing
scenario with only 10 samples/user, highlighting its strong auditing potential
in real-world applications. Our code is made available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频-视觉分割（AVS）面临跨模态对齐的挑战，现有方法未能有效结合多模态知识。TAViS旨在通过结合ImageBind和SAM2解决这一问题。

Method: TAViS采用文本桥接设计，包括混合提示机制和对齐监督策略，以解决特征空间差异和分割损失不足的问题。

Result: TAViS在单源、多源、语义数据集及零样本设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: TAViS通过文本桥接设计有效解决了跨模态对齐问题，提升了音频-视觉分割的性能。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) faces a fundamental challenge of effectively
aligning audio and visual modalities. While recent approaches leverage
foundation models to address data scarcity, they often rely on single-modality
knowledge or combine foundation models in an off-the-shelf manner, failing to
address the cross-modal alignment challenge. In this paper, we present TAViS, a
novel framework that \textbf{couples} the knowledge of multimodal foundation
models (ImageBind) for cross-modal alignment and a segmentation foundation
model (SAM2) for precise segmentation. However, effectively combining these
models poses two key challenges: the difficulty in transferring the knowledge
between SAM2 and ImageBind due to their different feature spaces, and the
insufficiency of using only segmentation loss for supervision. To address these
challenges, we introduce a text-bridged design with two key components: (1) a
text-bridged hybrid prompting mechanism where pseudo text provides class
prototype information while retaining modality-specific details from both audio
and visual inputs, and (2) an alignment supervision strategy that leverages
text as a bridge to align shared semantic concepts within audio-visual
modalities. Our approach achieves superior performance on single-source,
multi-source, semantic datasets, and excels in zero-shot settings.

Motivation: 癌症亚型分类需要大量专家标注，而标注资源有限。通过引入不确定性感知，可以优化标注过程并提升模型性能。

Method: 在自监督对比学习模型中计算证据向量，评估预测置信度，利用不确定性分数选择关键图像进行标注，迭代优化训练。

Result: 仅需少量标注即可在基准数据集上实现最优性能，同时提高分类精度和效率。

Conclusion: 该方法在标注数据有限的情况下具有显著优势，为数字病理学提供了新的研究方向和应用前景。

Abstract: Machine-learning-assisted cancer subtyping is a promising avenue in digital
pathology. Cancer subtyping models, however, require careful training using
expert annotations so that they can be inferred with a degree of known
certainty (or uncertainty). To this end, we introduce the concept of
uncertainty awareness into a self-supervised contrastive learning model. This
is achieved by computing an evidence vector at every epoch, which assesses the
model's confidence in its predictions. The derived uncertainty score is then
utilized as a metric to selectively label the most crucial images that require
further annotation, thus iteratively refining the training process. With just
1-10% of strategically selected annotations, we attain state-of-the-art
performance in cancer subtyping on benchmark datasets. Our method not only
strategically guides the annotation process to minimize the need for extensive
labeled datasets, but also improves the precision and efficiency of
classifications. This development is particularly beneficial in settings where
the availability of labeled data is limited, offering a promising direction for
future research and application in digital pathology.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为V2LMs的视觉语言模型，用于提升自动驾驶车辆感知任务的鲁棒性，无需对抗训练即可抵御未知攻击，性能优于传统DNN。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DNN在自动驾驶任务中易受攻击，且对抗训练会降低正常精度。V2LMs旨在解决这一问题，提供更安全的感知系统。

Method: 通过微调视觉语言模型（V2LMs），提出两种部署模式：Solo Mode（单任务）和Tandem Mode（多任务）。

Result: V2LMs在对抗条件下精度下降小于8%，远优于传统DNN（下降33%-46%）。Tandem Mode在内存效率上表现更优。

Conclusion: V2LMs为自动驾驶感知系统提供了更安全、高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on deep neural networks (DNNs) for critical
tasks such as traffic sign recognition (TSR), automated lane centering (ALC),
and vehicle detection (VD). However, these models are vulnerable to attacks
that can cause misclassifications and compromise safety. Traditional defense
mechanisms, including adversarial training, often degrade benign accuracy and
fail to generalize against unseen attacks. In this work, we introduce Vehicle
Vision Language Models (V2LMs), fine-tuned vision-language models specialized
for AV perception. Our findings demonstrate that V2LMs inherently exhibit
superior robustness against unseen attacks without requiring adversarial
training, maintaining significantly higher accuracy than conventional DNNs
under adversarial conditions. We evaluate two deployment strategies: Solo Mode,
where individual V2LMs handle specific perception tasks, and Tandem Mode, where
a single unified V2LM is fine-tuned for multiple tasks simultaneously.
Experimental results reveal that DNNs suffer performance drops of 33% to 46%
under attacks, whereas V2LMs maintain adversarial accuracy with reductions of
less than 8% on average. The Tandem Mode further offers a memory-efficient
alternative while achieving comparable robustness to Solo Mode. We also explore
integrating V2LMs as parallel components to AV perception to enhance resilience
against adversarial threats. Our results suggest that V2LMs offer a promising
path toward more secure and resilient AV perception systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake视频对数字安全、隐私和媒体完整性构成威胁，现有研究多集中于二元检测，而模型溯源任务尚未充分探索。

Method: FAME结合空间和时间注意力机制，捕捉不同生成模型的细微特征，保持计算效率。

Result: 在DFDM、FaceForensics++和FakeAVCeleb数据集上，FAME在准确性和运行时间上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FAME在现实取证和信息安全应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: The widespread emergence of face-swap Deepfake videos poses growing risks to
digital security, privacy, and media integrity, necessitating effective
forensic tools for identifying the source of such manipulations. Although most
prior research has focused primarily on binary Deepfake detection, the task of
model attribution -- determining which generative model produced a given
Deepfake -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce FAME (Fake
Attribution via Multilevel Embeddings), a lightweight and efficient
spatio-temporal framework designed to capture subtle generative artifacts
specific to different face-swap models. FAME integrates spatial and temporal
attention mechanisms to improve attribution accuracy while remaining
computationally efficient. We evaluate our model on three challenging and
diverse datasets: Deepfake Detection and Manipulation (DFDM), FaceForensics++,
and FakeAVCeleb. Results show that FAME consistently outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and runtime, highlighting its potential for deployment
in real-world forensic and information security applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SCD假设查询和参考图像视角完全对齐，但现实中参考图像通常来自不同视角。本文旨在解决这一不切实际的假设，提出更实用的ECD任务。

Method: 提出了一种联合理解空间环境和检测变化的框架，通过多参考候选和语义聚合方法解决视角偏差和视野限制问题。

Result: 在三个标准基准集上显著优于现有方法，性能接近理想设置。

Conclusion: ECD任务更贴近现实需求，提出的框架有效解决了视角偏差问题，性能优越。

Abstract: Humans do not memorize everything. Thus, humans recognize scene changes by
exploring the past images. However, available past (i.e., reference) images
typically represent nearby viewpoints of the present (i.e., query) scene,
rather than the identical view. Despite this practical limitation, conventional
Scene Change Detection (SCD) has been formalized under an idealized setting in
which reference images with matching viewpoints are available for every query.
In this paper, we push this problem toward a practical task and introduce
Environmental Change Detection (ECD). A key aspect of ECD is to avoid
unrealistically aligned query-reference pairs and rely solely on environmental
cues. Inspired by real-world practices, we provide these cues through a
large-scale database of uncurated images. To address this new task, we propose
a novel framework that jointly understands spatial environments and detects
changes. The main idea is that matching at the same spatial locations between a
query and a reference may lead to a suboptimal solution due to viewpoint
misalignment and limited field-of-view (FOV) coverage. We deal with this
limitation by leveraging multiple reference candidates and aggregating
semantically rich representations for change detection. We evaluate our
framework on three standard benchmark sets reconstructed for ECD, and
significantly outperform a naive combination of state-of-the-art methods while
achieving comparable performance to the oracle setting. The code will be
released upon acceptance.

Abstract: The advent of accessible Generative AI tools enables anyone to create and
spread synthetic images on social media, often with the intention to mislead,

Synthetic Image Detection (SID) solutions struggle on generated images sourced
from the Internet, as these are often altered by compression and other

augmentation combinations, leveraging a genetic algorithm for optimal
augmentation selection, and introducing a dual-criteria optimization approach.
These methods significantly improve model performance under real-world

models capable of identifying synthetic images across varying qualities and
transformations, with the best-performing model achieving a mean average

Conclusion: 通过几何关系优化伪标签和目标提示学习，显著提升了无监督域适应的性能。

Abstract: Recent approaches leveraging multi-modal pre-trained models like CLIP for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) have shown significant promise in bridging
domain gaps and improving generalization by utilizing rich semantic knowledge
and robust visual representations learned through extensive pre-training on
diverse image-text datasets. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art
performance across benchmarks, much of the improvement stems from base
pseudo-labels (CLIP zero-shot predictions) and self-training mechanisms. Thus,
the training mechanism exhibits a key limitation wherein the visual embedding
distribution in target domains can deviate from the visual embedding
distribution in the pre-trained model, leading to misguided signals from class
descriptions. This work introduces a fresh solution to reinforce these
pseudo-labels and facilitate target-prompt learning, by exploiting the geometry
of visual and text embeddings - an aspect that is overlooked by existing
methods. We first propose to directly leverage the reference predictions (from
source prompts) based on the relationship between source and target visual
embeddings. We later show that there is a strong clustering behavior observed
between visual and text embeddings in pre-trained multi-modal models. Building
on optimal transport theory, we transform this insight into a novel strategy to
enforce the clustering property in text embeddings, further enhancing the
alignment in the target domain. Our experiments and ablation studies validate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating superior performance
and improved quality of target prompts in terms of representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BridgeTower模型在逐层利用单模态表示、灵活利用不同层次语义知识以及高分辨率数据集评估方面存在不足。

Method: 提出ManagerTower，在Two-Tower VLM架构中引入Manager插件，并在MLLM架构中验证其有效性。

Result: ManagerTower在4个下游VL任务中表现优异，LLaVA-OV-Manager在20个数据集上显著提升零样本性能。

Conclusion: Manager插件和多网格算法协同作用，从深度和宽度两个正交视角提升视觉表示，缓解语义模糊性。

Abstract: Two-Tower Vision--Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across various downstream VL tasks. While BridgeTower further enhances
performance by building bridges between encoders, it \textit{(i)} suffers from
ineffective layer-by-layer utilization of unimodal representations,
\textit{(ii)} restricts the flexible exploitation of different levels of
unimodal semantic knowledge, and \textit{(iii)} is limited to the evaluation on
traditional low-resolution datasets only with the Two-Tower VLM architecture.
In this work, we propose Manager, a lightweight, efficient and effective plugin
that adaptively aggregates insights from different levels of pre-trained
unimodal experts to facilitate more comprehensive VL alignment and fusion.
First, under the Two-Tower VLM architecture, we introduce ManagerTower, a novel
VLM that introduces the manager in each cross-modal layer. Whether with or
without VL pre-training, ManagerTower outperforms previous strong baselines and
achieves superior performance on 4 downstream VL tasks. Moreover, we extend our
exploration to the latest Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture.
We demonstrate that LLaVA-OV-Manager significantly boosts the zero-shot
performance of LLaVA-OV across different categories of capabilities, images,
and resolutions on 20 downstream datasets, whether the multi-grid algorithm is
enabled or not. In-depth analysis reveals that both our manager and the
multi-grid algorithm can be viewed as a plugin that improves the visual
representation by capturing more diverse visual details from two orthogonal
perspectives (depth and width). Their synergy can mitigate the semantic
ambiguity caused by the multi-grid algorithm and further improve performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传感器平台初始化时，有限的初始测量可能导致估计不准确，容易陷入局部极小值。

Method: 延迟使用全局GNSS测量，初期依赖GNSS相对距离残差，基于Hessian矩阵奇异值变化确定切换时机。

Result: 在EuRoC和GVINS数据集上，该方法比传统方法更准确、鲁棒。

Conclusion: 提出的策略能有效提高初始化的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Initializing the state of a sensorized platform can be challenging, as a
limited set of initial measurements often carry limited information, leading to
poor initial estimates that may converge to local minima during non-linear
optimization. This paper proposes a novel GNSS-inertial initialization strategy
that delays the use of global GNSS measurements until sufficient information is
available to accurately estimate the transformation between the GNSS and
inertial frames. Instead, the method initially relies on GNSS relative distance
residuals. To determine the optimal moment for switching to global
measurements, we introduce a criterion based on the evolution of the Hessian
matrix singular values. Experiments on the EuRoC and GVINS datasets show that
our approach consistently outperforms the naive strategy of using global GNSS

Motivation: 当前PTQ方法在ViTs的低比特量化中仍存在显著的精度下降问题，需要改进。

Result: 实验证明，FIMA-Q在低比特量化下显著优于现有方法，提升了ViTs的量化精度。

Conclusion: FIMA-Q为ViTs的低比特量化提供了一种高效且精度更高的解决方案。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has stood out as a cost-effective and
promising model compression paradigm in recent years, as it avoids
computationally intensive model retraining. Nevertheless, current PTQ methods
for Vision Transformers (ViTs) still suffer from significant accuracy
degradation, especially under low-bit quantization. To address these
shortcomings, we analyze the prevailing Hessian-guided quantization loss, and
uncover certain limitations of conventional Hessian approximations. By
following the block-wise reconstruction framework, we propose a novel PTQ
method for ViTs, dubbed FIMA-Q. Specifically, we firstly establish the
connection between KL divergence and FIM, which enables fast computation of the
quantization loss during reconstruction. We further propose an efficient FIM
approximation method, namely DPLR-FIM, by employing the diagonal plus low-rank
principle, and formulate the ultimate quantization loss. Our extensive
experiments, conducted across various vision tasks with representative
ViT-based architectures on public datasets, demonstrate that our method
substantially promotes the accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art
approaches, especially in the case of low-bit quantization. The source code is

Abstract: Climate change is leading to an increase in extreme weather events, causing
significant environmental damage and loss of life. Early detection of such
events is essential for improving disaster response. In this work, we propose
SITS-Extreme, a novel framework that leverages satellite image time series to
detect extreme events by incorporating multiple pre-disaster observations. This
approach effectively filters out irrelevant changes while isolating
disaster-relevant signals, enabling more accurate detection. Extensive
experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets validate the
effectiveness of SITS-Extreme, demonstrating substantial improvements over
widely used strong bi-temporal baselines. Additionally, we examine the impact
of incorporating more timesteps, analyze the contribution of key components in
our framework, and evaluate its performance across different disaster types,
offering valuable insights into its scalability and applicability for
large-scale disaster monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旋转估计在计算机视觉和机器人任务中至关重要，但传统方法复杂且易受噪声影响，需要更鲁棒且高效的解决方案。

Method: 通过将旋转运动表示为四元数球面上的大圆，提出了一种基于投票的直观方法，并利用GPU实现并行计算。

Result: 方法在噪声和异常值下表现优异，能快速处理大规模（10^6）和高异常值比例（99%）的问题。

Conclusion: 实验验证了方法的有效性和鲁棒性，为旋转估计提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Rotation estimation plays a fundamental role in computer vision and robot
tasks, and extremely robust rotation estimation is significantly useful for
safety-critical applications. Typically, estimating a rotation is considered a
non-linear and non-convex optimization problem that requires careful design.
However, in this paper, we provide some new perspectives that solving a
rotation estimation problem can be reformulated as solving a linear model
fitting problem without dropping any constraints and without introducing any
singularities. In addition, we explore the dual structure of a rotation motion,
revealing that it can be represented as a great circle on a quaternion sphere
surface. Accordingly, we propose an easily understandable voting-based method
to solve rotation estimation. The proposed method exhibits exceptional
robustness to noise and outliers and can be computed in parallel with graphics
processing units (GPUs) effortlessly. Particularly, leveraging the power of
GPUs, the proposed method can obtain a satisfactory rotation solution for
large-scale($10^6$) and severely corrupted (99$\%$ outlier ratio) rotation
estimation problems under 0.5 seconds. Furthermore, to validate our theoretical
framework and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, we conduct
controlled experiments and real-world dataset experiments. These experiments
provide compelling evidence supporting the effectiveness and robustness of our
approach in solving rotation estimation problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频质量评估（VQA）中，自由能自修复机制尚未充分探索，且现有系统受限于预训练模型，难以直接集成增强模块。

Method: 提出双分支架构（美学分支和技术分支），集成专用增强模块，并设计生物启发的预测头以融合全局和局部表示。

Result: 在五个公开VQA基准测试中表现优异，性能优于现有方法，同时提高了可解释性。

Conclusion: EyeSimVQA通过生物启发设计和自由能自修复机制，为VQA提供了高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Free-energy-guided self-repair mechanisms have shown promising results in
image quality assessment (IQA), but remain under-explored in video quality
assessment (VQA), where temporal dynamics and model constraints pose unique
challenges. Unlike static images, video content exhibits richer spatiotemporal
complexity, making perceptual restoration more difficult. Moreover, VQA systems
often rely on pre-trained backbones, which limits the direct integration of
enhancement modules without affecting model stability. To address these issues,
we propose EyeSimVQA, a novel VQA framework that incorporates free-energy-based
self-repair. It adopts a dual-branch architecture, with an aesthetic branch for
global perceptual evaluation and a technical branch for fine-grained structural
and semantic analysis. Each branch integrates specialized enhancement modules
tailored to distinct visual inputs-resized full-frame images and patch-based
fragments-to simulate adaptive repair behaviors. We also explore a principled
strategy for incorporating high-level visual features without disrupting the
original backbone. In addition, we design a biologically inspired prediction
head that models sweeping gaze dynamics to better fuse global and local
representations for quality prediction. Experiments on five public VQA
benchmarks demonstrate that EyeSimVQA achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while offering improved
interpretability through its biologically grounded design.

Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型在细粒度时间推理方面存在局限，难以精确关联视频时刻与响应，尤其在监督有限的情况下。

Method: 提出Temporal-aware Fuseformer，采用分层双流架构捕捉时间动态并融合视觉与音频信息，结合全局残差设计提升效率。通过四阶段渐进训练范式增强多模态对齐、语义基础和时序推理能力。

Conclusion: DaMO为数据高效的视频-语言建模提供了新方向，展示了在细粒度时间推理和多模态理解上的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been extended to the video domain,
enabling sophisticated video-language understanding. However, existing Video
LLMs often exhibit limitations in fine-grained temporal reasoning, restricting
their ability to precisely attribute responses to specific video moments,
especially under constrained supervision. We introduce DaMO, a data-efficient
Video LLM explicitly designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal
understanding. At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a
hierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal
dynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and
audio information. To further enhance computational efficiency, DaMO integrates
a global residual that reduces spatial redundancy while preserving essential
semantic details. We train DaMO via a structured four-stage progressive
training paradigm, incrementally equipping the model with multimodal alignment,
semantic grounding, and temporal reasoning capabilities. This work also
contributes multiple datasets augmented from existing ones with GPT-generated
temporally grounded QA pairs for tasks requiring temporal supervision.
Comprehensive experiments on temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks
demonstrate that DaMO consistently surpasses prior methods, particularly in
tasks demanding precise temporal alignment and reasoning. Our work establishes
a promising direction for data-efficient video-language modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管长链思维（CoT）能提升MLLMs解决复杂问题的能力，但其有效性原因尚不明确，尤其是视觉线索提取与推理过程对性能的贡献难以量化。

Method: 设计了基于GPT-Image-1的自动编辑流程，生成可控制的视觉线索修改；构建VFaith-Bench基准，通过编辑关键视觉线索生成对比问答对，评估模型推理能力。

Result: VFaith-Bench包含755个条目和五个子集，测试了主流模型，揭示了其推理能力与视觉感知的关系。

Conclusion: 研究为MLLMs的视觉推理能力提供了量化评估工具，并揭示了其推理能力的来源与局限性。

Abstract: Recent extensive works have demonstrated that by introducing long CoT, the
capabilities of MLLMs to solve complex problems can be effectively enhanced.
However, the reasons for the effectiveness of such paradigms remain unclear. It
is challenging to analysis with quantitative results how much the model's
specific extraction of visual cues and its subsequent so-called reasoning
during inference process contribute to the performance improvements. Therefore,
evaluating the faithfulness of MLLMs' reasoning to visual information is
crucial. To address this issue, we first present a cue-driven automatic and
controllable editing pipeline with the help of GPT-Image-1. It enables the
automatic and precise editing of specific visual cues based on the instruction.
Furthermore, we introduce VFaith-Bench, the first benchmark to evaluate MLLMs'
visual reasoning capabilities and analyze the source of such capabilities with
an emphasis on the visual faithfulness. Using the designed pipeline, we
constructed comparative question-answer pairs by altering the visual cues in
images that are crucial for solving the original reasoning problem, thereby
changing the question's answer. By testing similar questions with images that
have different details, the average accuracy reflects the model's visual
reasoning ability, while the difference in accuracy before and after editing
the test set images effectively reveals the relationship between the model's
reasoning ability and visual perception. We further designed specific metrics
to expose this relationship. VFaith-Bench includes 755 entries divided into
five distinct subsets, along with an additional human-labeled perception task.
We conducted in-depth testing and analysis of existing mainstream flagship
models and prominent open-source model series/reasoning models on VFaith-Bench,
further investigating the underlying factors of their reasoning capabilities.

Result: 方法精度87%，召回率91.7%，推理时间1.4毫秒，适合实时应用。

Conclusion: 通过增加数据集或图像增强方法，可进一步改进性能。

Abstract: The identification and classification of vehicles play a crucial role in
various aspects of the control-sanction system. Current technologies such as
weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems can classify most vehicle categories but they
struggle to accurately classify vehicles with lifted axles. Moreover, very few
commercial and technical methods exist for detecting lifted axles. In this
paper, as part of the European project SETO (Smart Enforcement of Transport
Operations), a method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), namely
YOLOv8s, was proposed for the detection of lifted truck axles in images of
trucks captured by cameras placed perpendicular to the direction of traffic.
The performance of the proposed method was assessed and it was found that it
had a precision of 87%, a recall of 91.7%, and an inference time of 1.4 ms,
which makes it well-suited for real time implantations. These results suggest
that further improvements could be made, potentially by increasing the size of
the datasets and/or by using various image augmentation methods.

Abstract: We introduce OV-MAP, a novel approach to open-world 3D mapping for mobile
robots by integrating open-features into 3D maps to enhance object recognition
capabilities. A significant challenge arises when overlapping features from
adjacent voxels reduce instance-level precision, as features spill over voxel
boundaries, blending neighboring regions together. Our method overcomes this by
employing a class-agnostic segmentation model to project 2D masks into 3D
space, combined with a supplemented depth image created by merging raw and
synthetic depth from point clouds. This approach, along with a 3D mask voting
mechanism, enables accurate zero-shot 3D instance segmentation without relying
on 3D supervised segmentation models. We assess the effectiveness of our method
through comprehensive experiments on public datasets such as ScanNet200 and
Replica, demonstrating superior zero-shot performance, robustness, and
adaptability across diverse environments. Additionally, we conducted real-world
experiments to demonstrate our method's adaptability and robustness when
applied to diverse real-world environments.

Abstract: Building on recent advances in language-based reasoning models, we explore
multimodal reasoning that integrates vision and text. Existing multimodal
benchmarks primarily test visual extraction combined with text-based reasoning,
lacking true visual reasoning with more complex interactions between vision and
language. Inspired by the ARC challenge, we introduce EasyARC, a
vision-language benchmark requiring multi-image, multi-step reasoning, and
self-correction. EasyARC is procedurally generated, fully verifiable, and
scalable, making it ideal for reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines. The
generators incorporate progressive difficulty levels, enabling structured
evaluation across task types and complexities. We benchmark state-of-the-art
vision-language models and analyze their failure modes. We argue that EasyARC
sets a new standard for evaluating true reasoning and test-time scaling
capabilities in vision-language models. We open-source our benchmark dataset
and evaluation code.

Result: 在Cityscapes和PASCAL VOC 2012数据集上表现优异，仅用20%预算即超越现有方法，性能提升27.23%。

Conclusion: A²LC框架高效且有效，为语义分割标签校正提供了新思路。

Abstract: Active Label Correction (ALC) has emerged as a promising solution to the high
cost and error-prone nature of manual pixel-wise annotation in semantic
segmentation, by selectively identifying and correcting mislabeled data.
Although recent work has improved correction efficiency by generating
pseudo-labels using foundation models, substantial inefficiencies still remain.
In this paper, we propose Active and Automated Label Correction for semantic
segmentation (A$^2$LC), a novel and efficient ALC framework that integrates an
automated correction stage into the conventional pipeline. Specifically, the
automated correction stage leverages annotator feedback to perform label
correction beyond the queried samples, thereby maximizing cost efficiency. In
addition, we further introduce an adaptively balanced acquisition function that
emphasizes underrepresented tail classes and complements the automated
correction mechanism. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012
demonstrate that A$^2$LC significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art
methods. Notably, A$^2$LC achieves high efficiency by outperforming previous
methods using only 20% of their budget, and demonstrates strong effectiveness
by yielding a 27.23% performance improvement under an equivalent budget
constraint on the Cityscapes dataset. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Abstract: WiFi-based human behavior recognition aims to recognize gestures and
activities by analyzing wireless signal variations. However, existing methods
typically focus on a single type of data, neglecting the interaction and fusion
of multiple features. To this end, we propose a novel multimodal collaborative
awareness method. By leveraging phase data reflecting changes in dynamic path
length and Doppler Shift (DFS) data corresponding to frequency changes related
to the speed of gesture movement, we enable efficient interaction and fusion of
these features to improve recognition accuracy. Specifically, we first
introduce a dual-branch self-attention module to capture spatial-temporal cues
within each modality. Then, a group attention mechanism is applied to the
concatenated phase and DFS features to mine key group features critical for
behavior recognition. Through a gating mechanism, the combined features are
further divided into PD-strengthen and PD-weaken branches, optimizing
information entropy and promoting cross-modal collaborative awareness.
Extensive in-domain and cross-domain experiments on two large publicly
available datasets, Widar3.0 and XRF55, demonstrate the superior performance of
our method.

Abstract: Sign language generation aims to produce diverse sign representations based
on spoken language. However, achieving realistic and naturalistic generation
remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of sign language, which
encompasses intricate hand gestures, facial expressions, and body movements. In
this work, we introduce PHOENIX14T+, an extended version of the widely-used
RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T dataset, featuring three new sign representations:
Pose, Hamer and Smplerx. We also propose a novel method, SignAligner, for
realistic sign language generation, consisting of three stages: text-driven
pose modalities co-generation, online collaborative correction of
multimodality, and realistic sign video synthesis. First, by incorporating text
semantics, we design a joint sign language generator to simultaneously produce
posture coordinates, gesture actions, and body movements. The text encoder,
based on a Transformer architecture, extracts semantic features, while a
cross-modal attention mechanism integrates these features to generate diverse
sign language representations, ensuring accurate mapping and controlling the
diversity of modal features. Next, online collaborative correction is
introduced to refine the generated pose modalities using a dynamic loss
weighting strategy and cross-modal attention, facilitating the complementarity
of information across modalities, eliminating spatiotemporal conflicts, and
ensuring semantic coherence and action consistency. Finally, the corrected pose
modalities are fed into a pre-trained video generation network to produce
high-fidelity sign language videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SignAligner significantly improves both the accuracy and expressiveness of the
generated sign videos.

Abstract: Fairness is a critical component of Trustworthy AI. In this paper, we focus
on Machine Learning (ML) and the performance of model predictions when dealing
with skin color. Unlike other sensitive attributes, the nature of skin color
differs significantly. In computer vision, skin color is represented as tensor
data rather than categorical values or single numerical points. However, much
of the research on fairness across sensitive groups has focused on categorical
features such as gender and race. This paper introduces a new technique for
evaluating fairness in ML for image classification tasks, specifically without
the use of annotation. To address the limitations of prior work, we handle
tensor data, like skin color, without classifying it rigidly. Instead, we
convert it into probability distributions and apply statistical distance
measures. This novel approach allows us to capture fine-grained nuances in
fairness both within and across what would traditionally be considered distinct
groups. Additionally, we propose an innovative training method to mitigate the
latent biases present in conventional skin tone categorization. This method
leverages color distance estimates calculated through Bayesian regression with
polynomial functions, ensuring a more nuanced and equitable treatment of skin
color in ML models.

Result: DISCO在多种偏差缓解实验中表现优异，成为传统核方法的有效替代。

Conclusion: SAM和DISCO为反因果预测提供了新框架，有效减少无关信号干扰。

Abstract: During prediction tasks, models can use any signal they receive to come up
with the final answer - including signals that are causally irrelevant. When
predicting objects from images, for example, the lighting conditions could be
correlated to different targets through selection bias, and an oblivious model
might use these signals as shortcuts to discern between various objects. A
predictor that uses lighting conditions instead of real object-specific details
is obviously undesirable. To address this challenge, we introduce a standard
anti-causal prediction model (SAM) that creates a causal framework for
analyzing the information pathways influencing our predictor in anti-causal
settings. We demonstrate that a classifier satisfying a specific conditional
independence criterion will focus solely on the direct causal path from label
to image, being counterfactually invariant to the remaining variables. Finally,
we propose DISCO, a novel regularization strategy that uses conditional
distance correlation to optimize for conditional independence in regression
tasks. We can show that DISCO achieves competitive results in different bias
mitigation experiments, deeming it a valid alternative to classical
kernel-based methods.

Abstract: Instance segmentation of prohibited items in security X-ray images is a
critical yet challenging task. This is mainly caused by the significant
appearance gap between prohibited items in X-ray images and natural objects, as
well as the severe overlapping among objects in X-ray images. To address these
issues, we propose an occlusion-aware instance segmentation pipeline designed
to identify prohibited items in X-ray images. Specifically, to bridge the
representation gap, we integrate the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into our
pipeline, taking advantage of its rich priors and zero-shot generalization
capabilities. To address the overlap between prohibited items, we design an
occlusion-aware bilayer mask decoder module that explicitly models the
occlusion relationships. To supervise occlusion estimation, we manually
annotated occlusion areas of prohibited items in two large-scale X-ray image
segmentation datasets, PIDray and PIXray. We then reorganized these additional
annotations together with the original information as two occlusion-annotated
datasets, PIDray-A and PIXray-A. Extensive experimental results on these
occlusion-annotated datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method. The datasets and codes are available at: https://github.com/Ryh1218/Occ

*Chendi Ge,Xin Wang,Zeyang Zhang,Hong Chen,Jiapei Fan,Longtao Huang,Hui Xue,Wenwu Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态混合课程LoRA专家（D-MoLE）方法，通过动态调整MLLM架构以适应新任务，解决了任务架构冲突和模态不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用固定架构，难以适应新任务，因此需要动态调整架构以提升适应性。

Method: 提出D-MoLE方法，包括动态层间专家分配器和基于梯度的跨模态课程，以优化架构和模态更新。

Result: 实验表明D-MoLE显著优于现有方法，平均提升15%。

Conclusion: 这是首个从架构角度研究MLLM持续学习的工作，为动态任务适应提供了新思路。

Abstract: Continual multimodal instruction tuning is crucial for adapting Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to evolving tasks. However, most existing methods
adopt a fixed architecture, struggling with adapting to new tasks due to static
model capacity. We propose to evolve the architecture under parameter budgets
for dynamic task adaptation, which remains unexplored and imposes two
challenges: 1) task architecture conflict, where different tasks require
varying layer-wise adaptations, and 2) modality imbalance, where different
tasks rely unevenly on modalities, leading to unbalanced updates. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel Dynamic Mixture of Curriculum LoRA Experts
(D-MoLE) method, which automatically evolves MLLM's architecture with
controlled parameter budgets to continually adapt to new tasks while retaining
previously learned knowledge. Specifically, we propose a dynamic layer-wise
expert allocator, which automatically allocates LoRA experts across layers to
resolve architecture conflicts, and routes instructions layer-wisely to
facilitate knowledge sharing among experts. Then, we propose a gradient-based
inter-modal continual curriculum, which adjusts the update ratio of each module
in MLLM based on the difficulty of each modality within the task to alleviate
the modality imbalance problem. Extensive experiments show that D-MoLE
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 15% average
improvement over the best baseline. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study of continual learning for MLLMs from an architectural perspective.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种跨模态聚类引导负采样方法（CM-CGNS），通过改进负样本选择和增强局部细节提取，提升了医学视觉表征学习的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在医学图像与报告的多模态自监督学习中存在三个主要问题：负样本选择不当、忽略局部细节和低层次特征。

Method: 1）通过跨模态注意力扩展k-means聚类到多模态领域；2）引入跨模态掩码图像重建模块（CM-MIR）增强局部特征交互。

Result: 在五个下游数据集上的分类、检测和分割任务中，CM-CGNS在多项指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CM-CGNS通过改进负样本选择和局部特征提取，显著提升了医学视觉表征学习的性能。

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations directly from paired images and
reports through multimodal self-supervised learning has emerged as a novel and
efficient approach to digital diagnosis in recent years. However, existing
models suffer from several severe limitations. 1) neglecting the selection of
negative samples, resulting in the scarcity of hard negatives and the inclusion
of false negatives; 2) focusing on global feature extraction, but overlooking
the fine-grained local details that are crucial for medical image recognition
tasks; and 3) contrastive learning primarily targets high-level features but
ignoring low-level details which are essential for accurate medical analysis.
Motivated by these critical issues, this paper presents a Cross-Modal
Cluster-Guided Negative Sampling (CM-CGNS) method with two-fold ideas. First,
it extends the k-means clustering used for local text features in the
single-modal domain to the multimodal domain through cross-modal attention.
This improvement increases the number of negative samples and boosts the model
representation capability. Second, it introduces a Cross-Modal Masked Image
Reconstruction (CM-MIR) module that leverages local text-to-image features
obtained via cross-modal attention to reconstruct masked local image regions.
This module significantly strengthens the model's cross-modal information
interaction capabilities and retains low-level image features essential for
downstream tasks. By well handling the aforementioned limitations, the proposed
CM-CGNS can learn effective and robust medical visual representations suitable
for various recognition tasks. Extensive experimental results on
classification, detection, and segmentation tasks across five downstream
datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on
multiple metrics, verifying its superior performance.

Motivation: 评估气道影像生物标志物对肺纤维化患者生存结果的预测价值。

Method: 1. 使用nn-Unet分割气道结构；2. 从气管和气道周围提取关键特征；3. 用SVM分类器整合特征。

Result: 任务1分割评分为0.8601，任务2分类评分为0.7346。

Conclusion: 气道影像特征对预测肺纤维化患者生存结果具有潜在价值。

Abstract: The primary objective of the AIIB 2023 competition is to evaluate the
predictive significance of airway-related imaging biomarkers in determining the
survival outcomes of patients with lung fibrosis.This study introduces a
comprehensive three-stage approach. Initially, a segmentation network, namely
nn-Unet, is employed to delineate the airway's structural boundaries.
Subsequently, key features are extracted from the radiomic images centered
around the trachea and an enclosing bounding box around the airway. This step
is motivated by the potential presence of critical survival-related insights
within the tracheal region as well as pertinent information encoded in the
structure and dimensions of the airway. Lastly, radiomic features obtained from
the segmented areas are integrated into an SVM classifier. We could obtain an
overall-score of 0.8601 for the segmentation in Task 1 while 0.7346 for the
classification in Task 2.

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于COCO图像数据集的三类动作识别，比较了不同模型性能，发现ViT表现最佳，并探讨了其可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不同模型在人类动作识别任务中的表现，尤其是ViT的优越性及其可解释性。

Method: 使用三类COCO数据集，测试了全连接网络、卷积网络、CLIP模型和ViT，并通过SHAP和LeGrad进行定性分析。

Result: ViT在测试集上达到90%准确率，显著优于其他模型（卷积网络35%，CLIP模型62-64%），且差异具有统计显著性。

Conclusion: ViT在数据效率和动作识别任务中表现优异，可解释性技术有助于诊断模型错误。

Abstract: This study explores human action recognition using a three-class subset of
the COCO image corpus, benchmarking models from simple fully connected networks
to transformer architectures. The binary Vision Transformer (ViT) achieved 90%
mean test accuracy, significantly exceeding multiclass classifiers such as
convolutional networks (approximately 35%) and CLIP-based models (approximately
62-64%). A one-way ANOVA (F = 61.37, p < 0.001) confirmed these differences are
statistically significant. Qualitative analysis with SHAP explainer and LeGrad
heatmaps indicated that the ViT localizes pose-specific regions (e.g., lower
limbs for walking or running), while simpler feed-forward models often focus on
background textures, explaining their errors. These findings emphasize the data
efficiency of transformer representations and the importance of explainability
techniques in diagnosing class-specific failures.

TL;DR: MTabVQA是一个新的多表格视觉问答基准，旨在评估视觉语言模型在多表格图像中的解析和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准未能评估模型在多表格图像中的解析和跨表格推理能力，MTabVQA填补了这一空白。

Method: 引入MTabVQA基准，包含3,745个复杂问答对，并开发MTabVQA-Instruct数据集用于微调。

Result: 实验显示现有视觉语言模型在MTabVQA上表现有限，但通过MTabVQA-Instruct微调后性能显著提升。

Conclusion: MTabVQA为多表格视觉推理提供了重要基准，微调技术可有效提升模型能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
interpreting visual layouts and text. However, a significant challenge remains
in their ability to interpret robustly and reason over multi-tabular data
presented as images, a common occurrence in real-world scenarios like web pages
and digital documents. Existing benchmarks typically address single tables or
non-visual data (text/structured). This leaves a critical gap: they don't
assess the ability to parse diverse table images, correlate information across
them, and perform multi-hop reasoning on the combined visual data. We introduce
MTabVQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed for multi-tabular visual
question answering to bridge that gap. MTabVQA comprises 3,745 complex
question-answer pairs that necessitate multi-hop reasoning across several
visually rendered table images. We provide extensive benchmark results for
state-of-the-art VLMs on MTabVQA, revealing significant performance
limitations. We further investigate post-training techniques to enhance these
reasoning abilities and release MTabVQA-Instruct, a large-scale
instruction-tuning dataset. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with
MTabVQA-Instruct substantially improves their performance on visual
multi-tabular reasoning. Code and dataset

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DMAF-Net模型，通过动态模态感知融合、关系蒸馏与原型蒸馏框架及动态训练监控策略，解决多模态医学图像分割中的模态不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖完整模态假设，无法动态平衡模态贡献，忽略模态间结构关系，导致在真实临床场景中性能不佳。

Method: 1. 动态模态感知融合模块（DMAF）结合Transformer注意力和自适应掩码；2. 关系蒸馏与原型蒸馏框架实现全局-局部特征对齐；3. 动态训练监控策略优化训练过程。

Result: 在BraTS2020和MyoPS2020数据集上，DMAF-Net优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DMAF-Net有效解决了模态不平衡问题，提升了多模态医学图像分割性能。

Abstract: Incomplete multi-modal medical image segmentation faces critical challenges
from modality imbalance, including imbalanced modality missing rates and
heterogeneous modality contributions. Due to their reliance on idealized
assumptions of complete modality availability, existing methods fail to
dynamically balance contributions and neglect the structural relationships
between modalities, resulting in suboptimal performance in real-world clinical
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model, named
Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion Network (DMAF-Net). The DMAF-Net adopts three key
ideas. First, it introduces a Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion (DMAF) module to
suppress missing-modality interference by combining transformer attention with
adaptive masking and weight modality contributions dynamically through
attention maps. Second, it designs a synergistic Relation Distillation and
Prototype Distillation framework to enforce global-local feature alignment via
covariance consistency and masked graph attention, while ensuring semantic
consistency through cross-modal class-specific prototype alignment. Third, it
presents a Dynamic Training Monitoring (DTM) strategy to stabilize optimization
under imbalanced missing rates by tracking distillation gaps in real-time, and
to balance convergence speeds across modalities by adaptively reweighting
losses and scaling gradients. Extensive experiments on BraTS2020 and MyoPS2020
demonstrate that DMAF-Net outperforms existing methods for incomplete
multi-modal medical image segmentation. Extensive experiments on BraTS2020 and
MyoPS2020 demonstrate that DMAF-Net outperforms existing methods for incomplete

Abstract: This paper addresses two main objectives. Firstly, we demonstrate the
impressive performance of the LLaVA-NeXT-interleave on 22 datasets across three
different tasks: Multi-Image Reasoning, Documents and Knowledge-Based

compare its performance against the standard model. We find that the standard
model achieves the highest overall accuracy, excelling in vision-heavy tasks
like VISION, NLVR2, and Fashion200K. Meanwhile, the DCI-enhanced version shows
particular strength on datasets requiring deeper semantic coherence or
structured change understanding such as MIT-States_PropertyCoherence and

Motivation: 提升Sentinel-2影像的分辨率，同时保持光谱一致性和空间对齐，解决现有超分辨率方法的局限性。

Method: 两阶段方法：1）基于扩散模型的RGB超分辨率；2）利用超分辨率RGB图像作为空间先验，通过融合网络上采样多光谱波段。

Abstract: This paper presents DiffFuSR, a modular pipeline for super-resolving all 12
spectral bands of Sentinel-2 Level-2A imagery to a unified ground sampling
distance (GSD) of 2.5 meters. The pipeline comprises two stages: (i) a
diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) model trained on high-resolution RGB
imagery from the NAIP and WorldStrat datasets, harmonized to simulate
Sentinel-2 characteristics; and (ii) a learned fusion network that upscales the
remaining multispectral bands using the super-resolved RGB image as a spatial
prior. We introduce a robust degradation model and contrastive degradation
encoder to support blind SR. Extensive evaluations of the proposed SR pipeline
on the OpenSR benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
current SOTA baselines in terms of reflectance fidelity, spectral consistency,
spatial alignment, and hallucination suppression. Furthermore, the fusion
network significantly outperforms classical pansharpening approaches, enabling
accurate enhancement of Sentinel-2's 20 m and 60 m bands. This study
underscores the power of harmonized learning with generative priors and fusion
strategies to create a modular framework for Sentinel-2 SR. Our code and models

TL;DR: MambaVSR是一种基于状态空间模型的视频超分辨率框架，通过动态时空交互和内容感知机制，解决了传统方法在大位移和长序列中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频超分辨率（VSR）在建模非局部依赖性和保持计算效率方面面临挑战，传统方法（如光流或Transformer）难以处理大位移和长序列。

Method: 提出MambaVSR框架，包含Shared Compass Construction（SCC）和Content-Aware Sequentialization（CAS）模块，通过动态扫描和特征对齐实现高效时空交互。

Result: 在REDS数据集上，MambaVSR比基于Transformer的方法PSNR提升0.58 dB，且参数减少55%。

Conclusion: MambaVSR通过创新的状态空间模型和内容感知机制，显著提升了视频超分辨率的性能和效率。

Abstract: Video super-resolution (VSR) faces critical challenges in effectively
modeling non-local dependencies across misaligned frames while preserving
computational efficiency. Existing VSR methods typically rely on optical flow
strategies or transformer architectures, which struggle with large motion
displacements and long video sequences. To address this, we propose MambaVSR,
the first state-space model framework for VSR that incorporates an innovative
content-aware scanning mechanism. Unlike rigid 1D sequential processing in
conventional vision Mamba methods, our MambaVSR enables dynamic spatiotemporal
interactions through the Shared Compass Construction (SCC) and the
Content-Aware Sequentialization (CAS). Specifically, the SCC module constructs
intra-frame semantic connectivity graphs via efficient sparse attention and
generates adaptive spatial scanning sequences through spectral clustering.
Building upon SCC, the CAS module effectively aligns and aggregates non-local
similar content across multiple frames by interleaving temporal features along
the learned spatial order. To bridge global dependencies with local details,
the Global-Local State Space Block (GLSSB) synergistically integrates window
self-attention operations with SSM-based feature propagation, enabling
high-frequency detail recovery under global dependency guidance. Extensive
experiments validate MambaVSR's superiority, outperforming the
Transformer-based method by 0.58 dB PSNR on the REDS dataset with 55% fewer
parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异常检测因定义模糊、类型多样及数据稀缺而复杂，需综合模型以捕获多级特征。

Method: 利用CLIP和扩散模型，提取跨注意力图与特征图，实现多模态融合。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集上表现优异，超越基线方法。

Conclusion: 多模态与多模型融合有效解决异常检测挑战，为实际应用提供可扩展方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a complex problem due to the ambiguity in defining
anomalies, the diversity of anomaly types (e.g., local and global defect), and
the scarcity of training data. As such, it necessitates a comprehensive model
capable of capturing both low-level and high-level features, even with limited
data. To address this, we propose CLIPFUSION, a method that leverages both
discriminative and generative foundation models. Specifically, the CLIP-based
discriminative model excels at capturing global features, while the
diffusion-based generative model effectively captures local details, creating a
synergistic and complementary approach. Notably, we introduce a methodology for
utilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps extracted from diffusion models
specifically for anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets
(MVTec-AD, VisA) demonstrate that CLIPFUSION consistently outperforms baseline
methods, achieving outstanding performance in both anomaly segmentation and
classification. We believe that our method underscores the effectiveness of
multi-modal and multi-model fusion in tackling the multifaceted challenges of
anomaly detection, providing a scalable solution for real-world applications.

Result: 在五个HAR基准数据集上，结合少量真实数据，虚拟数据显著提升模型性能，达到与全量真实数据训练相当的效果。

Conclusion: 虚拟数据为解决标注数据不足的挑战提供了有效途径，无需人工采集数据。

Abstract: A major obstacle in developing robust and generalizable smart home-based
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems is the lack of large-scale, diverse
labeled datasets. Variability in home layouts, sensor configurations, and user
behavior adds further complexity, as individuals follow varied routines and
perform activities in distinct ways. Building HAR systems that generalize well
requires training data that captures the diversity across users and
environments. To address these challenges, we introduce AgentSense, a virtual
data generation pipeline where diverse personas are generated by leveraging
Large Language Models. These personas are used to create daily routines, which
are then decomposed into low-level action sequences. Subsequently, the actions
are executed in a simulated home environment called VirtualHome that we
extended with virtual ambient sensors capable of recording the agents
activities as they unfold. Overall, AgentSense enables the generation of rich,
virtual sensor datasets that represent a wide range of users and home settings.
Across five benchmark HAR datasets, we show that leveraging our virtual sensor
data substantially improves performance, particularly when real data are
limited. Notably, models trained on a combination of virtual data and just a
few days of real data achieve performance comparable to those trained on the
entire real datasets. These results demonstrate and prove the potential of
virtual data to address one of the most pressing challenges in ambient sensing,
which is the distinct lack of large-scale, annotated datasets without requiring
any manual data collection efforts.

Abstract: Isometric exercises appeal to individuals seeking convenience, privacy, and
minimal dependence on equipments. However, such fitness training is often
overdependent on unreliable digital media content instead of expert
supervision, introducing serious risks, including incorrect posture, injury,
and disengagement due to lack of corrective feedback. To address these
challenges, we present a real-time feedback system for assessing isometric
poses. Our contributions include the release of the largest multiclass
isometric exercise video dataset to date, comprising over 3,600 clips across
six poses with correct and incorrect variations. To support robust evaluation,
we benchmark state-of-the-art models-including graph-based networks-on this
dataset and introduce a novel three-part metric that captures classification
accuracy, mistake localization, and model confidence. Our results enhance the
feasibility of intelligent and personalized exercise training systems for home
workouts. This expert-level diagnosis, delivered directly to the users, also
expands the potential applications of these systems to rehabilitation,
physiotherapy, and various other fitness disciplines that involve physical
motion.

Conclusion: DISCOVR通过双分支设计和知识蒸馏，显著提升了心脏超声视频表示学习的效果。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved major advances in natural images
and video understanding, but challenges remain in domains like echocardiography
(heart ultrasound) due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal
dynamics, and the current lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing
SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based
methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR
inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort
clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision
for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework
for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a
clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online
image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are
connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers
anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder,
enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained
semantic understanding. Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning
fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized
video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in
zero-shot and linear probing setups, and achieves superior segmentation
transfer.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) are essential in computer vision but are
computationally intensive, too. Model quantization, particularly to low
bit-widths like 4-bit, aims to alleviate this difficulty, yet existing
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods
exhibit significant limitations. PTQ often incurs substantial accuracy drop,
while QAT achieves high accuracy but suffers from prohibitive computational
costs, limited generalization to downstream tasks, training instability, and
lacking of open-source codebase. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces General, Practical, and Lightning Quantization (GPLQ), a novel
framework designed for efficient and effective ViT quantization. GPLQ is
founded on two key empirical insights: the paramount importance of activation
quantization and the necessity of preserving the model's original optimization
``basin'' to maintain generalization. Consequently, GPLQ employs a sequential
``activation-first, weights-later'' strategy. Stage 1 keeps weights in FP32
while quantizing activations with a feature mimicking loss in only 1 epoch to
keep it stay in the same ``basin'', thereby preserving generalization. Stage 2
quantizes weights using a PTQ method. As a result, GPLQ is 100x faster than
existing QAT methods, lowers memory footprint to levels even below FP32
training, and achieves 4-bit model performance that is highly competitive with
FP32 models in terms of both accuracy on ImageNet and generalization to diverse
downstream tasks, including fine-grained visual classification and object
detection. We will release an easy-to-use open-source toolkit supporting
multiple vision tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, the development of interconnected devices has expanded in
many fields, from infotainment to education and industrial applications. This
trend has been accelerated by the increased number of sensors and accessibility
to powerful hardware and software. One area that significantly benefits from
these advancements is Teleoperated Driving (TD). In this scenario, a controller
drives safely a vehicle from remote leveraging sensors data generated onboard
the vehicle, and exchanged via Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications. In
this work, we tackle the problem of detecting the presence of cars and
pedestrians from point cloud data to enable safe TD operations. More
specifically, we exploit the SELMA dataset, a multimodal, open-source,
synthetic dataset for autonomous driving, that we expanded by including the
ground-truth bounding boxes of 3D objects to support object detection. We
analyze the performance of state-of-the-art compression algorithms and object
detectors under several metrics, including compression efficiency,
(de)compression and inference time, and detection accuracy. Moreover, we
measure the impact of compression and detection on the V2X network in terms of
data rate and latency with respect to 3GPP requirements for TD applications.

Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在VLT任务上缺乏系统评估，且现有数据集在语义和文化保真度上存在不足。

Method: 研究从数据、模型和评估三个维度展开：1）提出高质量数据集AibTrans；2）评估11种商业和6种开源模型；3）提出Density-Aware Evaluation和DA Score。

Result: 发现高资源语言对微调会损害跨语言性能，并提出平衡多语言微调策略。

Conclusion: 建立了新的VLT评估基准，并提出了改进模型性能的有效策略。

Abstract: Vision-Language Translation (VLT) is a challenging task that requires
accurately recognizing multilingual text embedded in images and translating it
into the target language with the support of visual context. While recent Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multilingual and visual
understanding capabilities, there is a lack of systematic evaluation and
understanding of their performance on VLT. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of VLT from three key perspectives: data quality, model
architecture, and evaluation metrics. (1) We identify critical limitations in
existing datasets, particularly in semantic and cultural fidelity, and
introduce AibTrans -- a multilingual, parallel, human-verified dataset with
OCR-corrected annotations. (2) We benchmark 11 commercial LVLMs/LLMs and 6
state-of-the-art open-source models across end-to-end and cascaded
architectures, revealing their OCR dependency and contrasting generation versus
reasoning behaviors. (3) We propose Density-Aware Evaluation to address metric
reliability issues under varying contextual complexity, introducing the DA
Score as a more robust measure of translation quality. Building upon these
findings, we establish a new evaluation benchmark for VLT. Notably, we observe
that fine-tuning LVLMs on high-resource language pairs degrades cross-lingual
performance, and we propose a balanced multilingual fine-tuning strategy that
effectively adapts LVLMs to VLT without sacrificing their generalization
ability.

Conclusion: 该方法为低成本3D检测提供了可行方案，尤其适用于多类型道路使用者。

Abstract: Image-based 3D object detection is an inevitable part of autonomous driving
because cheap onboard cameras are already available in most modern cars.
Because of the accurate depth information, currently, most state-of-the-art 3D
object detectors heavily rely on LiDAR data. In this paper, we propose a
pipeline which lifts the results of existing vision-based 2D algorithms to 3D
detections using only cameras as a cost-effective alternative to LiDAR. In
contrast to existing approaches, we focus not only on cars but on all types of
road users. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first using a 2D CNN to
process the point cloud for each 2D detection to keep the computational effort
as low as possible. Our evaluation on the challenging KITTI 3D object detection
benchmark shows results comparable to state-of-the-art image-based approaches
while having a runtime of only a third.

Result: SphereDrag在几何一致性和图像质量上显著提升，相对改进达10.5%。

Conclusion: SphereDrag为全景图像编辑提供了高效解决方案，并通过PanoBench标准化评估框架验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Image editing has made great progress on planar images, but panoramic image
editing remains underexplored. Due to their spherical geometry and projection
distortions, panoramic images present three key challenges: boundary
discontinuity, trajectory deformation, and uneven pixel density. To tackle
these issues, we propose SphereDrag, a novel panoramic editing framework
utilizing spherical geometry knowledge for accurate and controllable editing.
Specifically, adaptive reprojection (AR) uses adaptive spherical rotation to
deal with discontinuity; great-circle trajectory adjustment (GCTA) tracks the
movement trajectory more accurate; spherical search region tracking (SSRT)
adaptively scales the search range based on spherical location to address
uneven pixel density. Also, we construct PanoBench, a panoramic editing
benchmark, including complex editing tasks involving multiple objects and
diverse styles, which provides a standardized evaluation framework. Experiments
show that SphereDrag gains a considerable improvement compared with existing
methods in geometric consistency and image quality, achieving up to 10.5%
relative improvement.

Motivation: SAR图像中的船舶实例分割对海事监控、环境分析和国家安全至关重要，但现有方法在尺度变化、目标密度和模糊边界方面表现不佳。

Method: O2Former基于Mask2Former，引入优化查询生成器（OQG）和多尺度特征交互，以及方向感知嵌入模块（OAEM）增强方向敏感性。

Result: 实验表明，O2Former在SAR船舶数据集上优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: O2Former通过改进特征对齐和方向感知能力，显著提升了SAR船舶实例分割的效果。

Abstract: Instance segmentation of ships in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is
critical for applications such as maritime monitoring, environmental analysis,
and national security. SAR ship images present challenges including scale
variation, object density, and fuzzy target boundary, which are often
overlooked in existing methods, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
work, we propose O2Former, a tailored instance segmentation framework that
extends Mask2Former by fully leveraging the structural characteristics of SAR
imagery. We introduce two key components. The first is the Optimized Query
Generator(OQG). It enables multi-scale feature interaction by jointly encoding
shallow positional cues and high-level semantic information. This improves
query quality and convergence efficiency. The second component is the
Orientation-Aware Embedding Module(OAEM). It enhances directional sensitivity
through direction-aware convolution and polar-coordinate encoding. This
effectively addresses the challenge of uneven target orientations in SAR
scenes. Together, these modules facilitate precise feature alignment from
backbone to decoder and strengthen the model's capacity to capture fine-grained
structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that O2Former outperforms
state of the art instance segmentation baselines, validating its effectiveness
and generalization on SAR ship datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法在多任务协同下实现了几何稳健的图像合成和明确的几何预测。

Abstract: We introduce a diffusion-based framework that performs aligned novel view
image and geometry generation via a warping-and-inpainting methodology. Unlike
prior methods that require dense posed images or pose-embedded generative
models limited to in-domain views, our method leverages off-the-shelf geometry
predictors to predict partial geometries viewed from reference images, and
formulates novel-view synthesis as an inpainting task for both image and
geometry. To ensure accurate alignment between generated images and geometry,
we propose cross-modal attention distillation, where attention maps from the
image diffusion branch are injected into a parallel geometry diffusion branch
during both training and inference. This multi-task approach achieves
synergistic effects, facilitating geometrically robust image synthesis as well
as well-defined geometry prediction. We further introduce proximity-based mesh
conditioning to integrate depth and normal cues, interpolating between point
cloud and filtering erroneously predicted geometry from influencing the
generation process. Empirically, our method achieves high-fidelity
extrapolative view synthesis on both image and geometry across a range of
unseen scenes, delivers competitive reconstruction quality under interpolation
settings, and produces geometrically aligned colored point clouds for
comprehensive 3D completion. Project page is available at

Abstract: This study evaluates a smartphone-based, deep-learning eye-tracking algorithm
by comparing its performance against a commercial infrared-based eye tracker,
the Tobii Pro Nano. The aim is to investigate the feasibility of
appearance-based gaze estimation under realistic mobile usage conditions. Key
sensitivity factors, including age, gender, vision correction, lighting
conditions, device type, and head position, were systematically analysed. The
appearance-based algorithm integrates a lightweight convolutional neural
network (MobileNet-V3) with a recurrent structure (Long Short-Term Memory) to
predict gaze coordinates from grayscale facial images. Gaze data were collected
from 51 participants using dynamic visual stimuli, and accuracy was measured
using Euclidean distance. The deep learning model produced a mean error of
17.76 mm, compared to 16.53 mm for the Tobii Pro Nano. While overall accuracy
differences were small, the deep learning-based method was more sensitive to
factors such as lighting, vision correction, and age, with higher failure rates
observed under low-light conditions among participants using glasses and in
older age groups. Device-specific and positional factors also influenced
tracking performance. These results highlight the potential of appearance-based
approaches for mobile eye tracking and offer a reference framework for
evaluating gaze estimation systems across varied usage conditions.

Motivation: 理解视觉语言模型（VLMs）如何实现视觉与语言表征的对齐，并探讨当前适配器架构是否最优。

Method: 冻结大型语言模型（LLM）和视觉变换器（ViT），仅训练线性适配器进行视觉指令调优，利用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）分析对齐过程。

Result: 实验表明，视觉表征与语言表征在中后层逐渐对齐，早期层存在显著不对齐。

Conclusion: 当前基于适配器的架构可能未最优支持跨模态表征学习，需进一步优化。

Abstract: Effective multimodal reasoning depends on the alignment of visual and
linguistic representations, yet the mechanisms by which vision-language models
(VLMs) achieve this alignment remain poorly understood. We introduce a
methodological framework that deliberately maintains a frozen large language
model (LLM) and a frozen vision transformer (ViT), connected solely by training
a linear adapter during visual instruction tuning. This design is fundamental
to our approach: by keeping the language model frozen, we ensure it maintains
its original language representations without adaptation to visual data.
Consequently, the linear adapter must map visual features directly into the
LLM's existing representational space rather than allowing the language model
to develop specialized visual understanding through fine-tuning. Our
experimental design uniquely enables the use of pre-trained sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) of the LLM as analytical probes. These SAEs remain perfectly aligned
with the unchanged language model and serve as a snapshot of the learned
language feature-representations. Through systematic analysis of SAE
reconstruction error, sparsity patterns, and feature SAE descriptions, we
reveal the layer-wise progression through which visual representations
gradually align with language feature representations, converging in
middle-to-later layers. This suggests a fundamental misalignment between ViT
outputs and early LLM layers, raising important questions about whether current
adapter-based architectures optimally facilitate cross-modal representation
learning.

Abstract: Test-time scaling offers a promising way to improve the reasoning performance
of vision-language large models (VLLMs) without additional training. In this
paper, we explore a simple but effective approach for applying test-time
scaling to radiology report generation. Specifically, we introduce a
lightweight Thought Graph Traversal (TGT) framework that guides the model to
reason through organ-specific findings in a medically coherent order. This
framework integrates structured medical priors into the prompt, enabling deeper
and more logical analysis with no changes to the underlying model. To further
enhance reasoning depth, we apply a reasoning budget forcing strategy that
adjusts the model's inference depth at test time by dynamically extending its
generation process. This simple yet powerful combination allows a frozen
radiology VLLM to self-correct and generate more accurate, consistent chest
X-ray reports. Our method outperforms baseline prompting approaches on standard
benchmarks, and also reveals dataset biases through traceable reasoning paths.

Motivation: 现有多模态CoT方法局限于语言空间，存在语言偏差且难以处理复杂视觉推理任务，VGR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: VGR通过检测相关图像区域并基于重播区域提供精确答案，构建了VGR-SFT数据集支持训练，推理时结合视觉参考框和重播阶段。

Result: VGR在LLaVA-NeXT-7B基线上表现优异，仅使用30%图像标记数，在MMStar、AI2D和ChartQA上分别提升4.1、7.1和12.9分。

Conclusion: VGR通过增强视觉感知能力，显著提升了多模态推理任务的性能，为复杂视觉推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In the field of multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, existing
approaches predominantly rely on reasoning on pure language space, which
inherently suffers from language bias and is largely confined to math or
science domains. This narrow focus limits their ability to handle complex
visual reasoning tasks that demand comprehensive understanding of image
details. To address these limitations, this paper introduces VGR, a novel
reasoning multimodal large language model (MLLM) with enhanced fine-grained
visual perception capabilities. Unlike traditional MLLMs that answer the
question or reasoning solely on the language space, our VGR first detects
relevant regions that may help to solve problems, and then provides precise
answers based on replayed image regions. To achieve this, we conduct a
large-scale SFT dataset called VGR -SFT that contains reasoning data with mixed
vision grounding and language deduction. The inference pipeline of VGR allows
the model to choose bounding boxes for visual reference and a replay stage is
introduced to integrates the corresponding regions into the reasoning process,
enhancing multimodel comprehension. Experiments on the LLaVA-NeXT-7B baseline
show that VGR achieves superior performance on multi-modal benchmarks requiring
comprehensive image detail understanding. Compared to the baseline, VGR uses
only 30\% of the image token count while delivering scores of +4.1 on MMStar,
+7.1 on AI2D, and a +12.9 improvement on ChartQA.

Abstract: Affordance grounding-localizing object regions based on natural language
descriptions of interactions-is a critical challenge for enabling intelligent
agents to understand and interact with their environments. However, this task
remains challenging due to the need for fine-grained part-level localization,
the ambiguity arising from multiple valid interaction regions, and the scarcity
of large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce Affogato, a large-scale
benchmark comprising 150K instances, annotated with open-vocabulary text
descriptions and corresponding 3D affordance heatmaps across a diverse set of
objects and interactions. Building on this benchmark, we develop simple yet
effective vision-language models that leverage pretrained part-aware vision
backbones and a text-conditional heatmap decoder. Our models trained with the
Affogato dataset achieve promising performance on the existing 2D and 3D
benchmarks, and notably, exhibit effectiveness in open-vocabulary cross-domain
generalization. The Affogato dataset is shared in public:

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for structuring
and leveraging diverse real-world knowledge, which serve as a fundamental
technology for enabling cognitive intelligence systems with advanced
understanding and reasoning capabilities. Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) aims
to infer new knowledge based on existing facts in KGs, playing a crucial role
in applications such as public security intelligence, intelligent healthcare,
and financial risk assessment. From a task-centric perspective, existing KGR
approaches can be broadly classified into static single-step KGR, static
multi-step KGR, dynamic KGR, multi-modal KGR, few-shot KGR, and inductive KGR.
While existing surveys have covered these six types of KGR tasks, a
comprehensive review that systematically summarizes all KGR tasks particularly
including downstream applications and more challenging reasoning paradigms
remains lacking. In contrast to previous works, this survey provides a more
comprehensive perspective on the research of KGR by categorizing approaches
based on primary reasoning tasks, downstream application tasks, and potential
challenging reasoning tasks. Besides, we explore advanced techniques, such as
large language models (LLMs), and their impact on KGR. This work aims to
highlight key research trends and outline promising future directions in the
field of KGR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 管理ACs在动态环境中具有挑战性，现有工具难以维护嵌入的知识，导致开发困难或虚假信心。

Method: 提出OntoGSN，包括GSN标准的OWL本体、辅助工具、SPARQL查询库和原型界面。

Result: OntoGSN严格遵循标准并通过多种评估，展示了在大型语言模型对抗鲁棒性中的动态AC管理能力。

Conclusion: OntoGSN为动态环境中的AC管理提供了有效解决方案，支持自动化和社区需求。

Abstract: Assurance cases (ACs) are a common artifact for building and maintaining
confidence in system properties such as safety or robustness. Constructing an
AC can be challenging, although existing tools provide support in static,
document-centric applications and methods for dynamic contexts (e.g.,
autonomous driving) are emerging. Unfortunately, managing ACs remains a
challenge, since maintaining the embedded knowledge in the face of changes
requires substantial effort, in the process deterring developers - or worse,
producing poorly managed cases that instill false confidence. To address this,
we present OntoGSN: an ontology and supporting middleware for managing ACs in
the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) standard. OntoGSN offers a knowledge
representation and a queryable graph that can be automatically populated,
evaluated, and updated. Our contributions include: a 1:1 formalization of the
GSN Community Standard v3 in an OWL ontology with SWRL rules; a helper ontology
and parser for integration with a widely used AC tool; a repository and
documentation of design decisions for OntoGSN maintenance; a SPARQL query
library with automation patterns; and a prototypical interface. The ontology
strictly adheres to the standard's text and has been evaluated according to
FAIR principles, the OOPS framework, competency questions, and community
feedback. The development of other middleware elements is guided by the
community needs and subject to ongoing evaluations. To demonstrate the utility
of our contributions, we illustrate dynamic AC management in an example
involving assurance of adversarial robustness in large language models.

TL;DR: 论文提出LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge方法，结合模糊逻辑和大型语言模型（LLM），用于自动化评估医学生的临床沟通技能，结果准确率超过80%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床沟通技能在医学教育中至关重要，但大规模实践和评估具有挑战性。现有LLM驱动的临床模拟难以提供符合医生主观判断的自动化评估。

Method: 通过数据收集、基于多维模糊集的数据标注、提示工程和监督微调（SFT）预训练LLM，提出LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge方法。

Result: LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge准确率超过80%，主要标准项超过90%，实现了可解释且符合人类偏好的评估。

Conclusion: 模糊逻辑与LLM结合可行，推动了医学教育中的自动化评估，支持更稳健的评估实践。

Abstract: Clinical communication skills are critical in medical education, and
practicing and assessing clinical communication skills on a scale is
challenging. Although LLM-powered clinical scenario simulations have shown
promise in enhancing medical students' clinical practice, providing automated
and scalable clinical evaluation that follows nuanced physician judgment is
difficult. This paper combines fuzzy logic and Large Language Model (LLM) and
proposes LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge to address the challenge of aligning the
automated evaluation of medical students' clinical skills with subjective
physicians' preferences. LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge is an approach that LLM is
fine-tuned to evaluate medical students' utterances within student-AI patient
conversation scripts based on human annotations from four fuzzy sets, including
Professionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, and Contextual
Distraction. The methodology of this paper started from data collection from
the LLM-powered medical education system, data annotation based on
multidimensional fuzzy sets, followed by prompt engineering and the supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) of the pre-trained LLMs using these human annotations. The
results show that the LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge achieves over 80\% accuracy, with
major criteria items over 90\%, effectively leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM as a
solution to deliver interpretable, human-aligned assessment. This work suggests
the viability of leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM to align with human
preferences, advances automated evaluation in medical education, and supports
more robust assessment and judgment practices. The GitHub repository of this

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MUDAS是一种针对资源受限物联网设备的多标签声音分类的无监督域适应框架，通过选择性重训练和自适应阈值提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UDA算法仅适用于单标签任务且计算资源需求高，无法满足多标签场景和物联网设备的需求。

Method: MUDAS通过选择性重训练分类器、自适应阈值生成伪标签和多样性正则化来优化多标签分类。

Result: 在SONYC-UST数据集上，MUDAS显著优于现有UDA算法，适用于资源受限环境。

Conclusion: MUDAS为物联网设备上的多标签声音分类提供了一种高效的无监督域适应解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is essential for adapting machine
learning models to new, unlabeled environments where data distribution shifts
can degrade performance. Existing UDA algorithms are designed for single-label
tasks and rely on significant computational resources, limiting their use in
multi-label scenarios and in resource-constrained IoT devices. Overcoming these
limitations is particularly challenging in contexts such as urban sound
classification, where overlapping sounds and varying acoustics require robust,
adaptive multi-label capabilities on low-power, on-device systems. To address
these limitations, we introduce Mote-scale Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for
Sounds (MUDAS), a UDA framework developed for multi-label sound classification
in resource-constrained IoT settings. MUDAS efficiently adapts models by
selectively retraining the classifier in situ using high-confidence data,
minimizing computational and memory requirements to suit on-device deployment.
Additionally, MUDAS incorporates class-specific adaptive thresholds to generate
reliable pseudo-labels and applies diversity regularization to improve
multi-label classification accuracy. In evaluations on the SONYC Urban Sound
Tagging (SONYC-UST) dataset recorded at various New York City locations, MUDAS
demonstrates notable improvements in classification accuracy over existing UDA
algorithms, achieving good performance in a resource-constrained IoT setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未能充分捕捉化学表格的多模态和领域复杂性，限制了多模态大语言模型在化学科学理解中的应用。

Method: 引入ChemTable，一个从文献实验部分提取的大规模化学表格基准，包含专家标注的单元格、逻辑布局和领域标签，支持表格识别和理解任务。

Result: 模型在基础布局解析上表现尚可，但在描述性和推理性问答任务上显著落后于人类表现，开源与闭源模型间存在性能差距。

Conclusion: ChemTable为科学推理提供了严格且现实的基准，凸显了化学表格理解的挑战。

Abstract: Chemical tables encode complex experimental knowledge through symbolic
expressions, structured variables, and embedded molecular graphics. Existing
benchmarks largely overlook this multimodal and domain-specific complexity,
limiting the ability of multimodal large language models to support scientific
understanding in chemistry. In this work, we introduce ChemTable, a large-scale
benchmark of real-world chemical tables curated from the experimental sections
of literature. ChemTable includes expert-annotated cell polygons, logical
layouts, and domain-specific labels, including reagents, catalysts, yields, and
graphical components and supports two core tasks: (1) Table Recognition,
covering structure parsing and content extraction; and (2) Table Understanding,
encompassing both descriptive and reasoning-oriented question answering
grounded in table structure and domain semantics. We evaluated a range of
representative multimodal models, including both open-source and closed-source
models, on ChemTable and reported a series of findings with practical and
conceptual insights. Although models show reasonable performance on basic
layout parsing, they exhibit substantial limitations on both descriptive and
inferential QA tasks compared to human performance, and we observe significant
performance gaps between open-source and closed-source models across multiple
dimensions. These results underscore the challenges of chemistry-aware table
understanding and position ChemTable as a rigorous and realistic benchmark for
advancing scientific reasoning.

Abstract: Family caregivers often face substantial mental health challenges due to
their multifaceted roles and limited resources. This study explored the
potential of a large language model (LLM)-powered conversational agent to
deliver evidence-based mental health support for caregivers, specifically
Problem-Solving Therapy (PST) integrated with Motivational Interviewing (MI)
and Behavioral Chain Analysis (BCA). A within-subject experiment was conducted
with 28 caregivers interacting with four LLM configurations to evaluate empathy
and therapeutic alliance. The best-performing models incorporated Few-Shot and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prompting techniques, alongside
clinician-curated examples. The models showed improved contextual understanding
and personalized support, as reflected by qualitative responses and
quantitative ratings on perceived empathy and therapeutic alliances.
Participants valued the model's ability to validate emotions, explore
unexpressed feelings, and provide actionable strategies. However, balancing
thorough assessment with efficient advice delivery remains a challenge. This
work highlights the potential of LLMs in delivering empathetic and tailored
support for family caregivers.

TL;DR: FocalAD是一种新型端到端自动驾驶框架，专注于关键局部交互，通过增强局部运动表示提升规划可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖全局运动特征，忽视了规划决策主要受局部交互影响，可能导致潜在风险被忽视。

Method: FocalAD包含两个核心模块：Ego-Local-Agents Interactor（ELAI）和Focal-Local-Agents Loss（FLA Loss），分别用于捕捉局部运动动态和增加关键邻居权重。

Result: 在nuScenes和Bench2Drive基准测试中表现优异，特别是在Adv-nuScenes数据集上碰撞率显著降低。

Conclusion: FocalAD通过聚焦局部交互显著提升了自动驾驶规划的可靠性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In end-to-end autonomous driving,the motion prediction plays a pivotal role
in ego-vehicle planning. However, existing methods often rely on globally
aggregated motion features, ignoring the fact that planning decisions are
primarily influenced by a small number of locally interacting agents. Failing
to attend to these critical local interactions can obscure potential risks and
undermine planning reliability. In this work, we propose FocalAD, a novel
end-to-end autonomous driving framework that focuses on critical local
neighbors and refines planning by enhancing local motion representations.
Specifically, FocalAD comprises two core modules: the Ego-Local-Agents
Interactor (ELAI) and the Focal-Local-Agents Loss (FLA Loss). ELAI conducts a
graph-based ego-centric interaction representation that captures motion
dynamics with local neighbors to enhance both ego planning and agent motion
queries. FLA Loss increases the weights of decision-critical neighboring
agents, guiding the model to prioritize those more relevant to planning.
Extensive experiments show that FocalAD outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on the open-loop nuScenes datasets and closed-loop Bench2Drive
benchmark. Notably, on the robustness-focused Adv-nuScenes dataset, FocalAD
achieves even greater improvements, reducing the average colilision rate by
41.9% compared to DiffusionDrive and by 15.6% compared to SparseDrive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在混合交通环境中，自动驾驶车辆需要适应人类驾驶车辆和突发情况，但现有方法难以解决局部冲突和随机事件。

Method: 提出局部状态注意力模块，利用自注意力机制压缩附近智能体的关键信息，以解决交通冲突。

Result: 在模拟高速公路合并场景中，该方法显著提高了合并效率，尤其是在高密度交通环境下。

Conclusion: 局部状态注意力模块在多智能体强化学习中有效解决了交通冲突，提升了自动驾驶车辆的适应性。

Abstract: In mixed-traffic environments, autonomous vehicles must adapt to
human-controlled vehicles and other unusual driving situations. This setting
can be framed as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environment with
full cooperative reward among the autonomous vehicles. While methods such as
Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization can be effective in training MARL
tasks, they often fail to resolve local conflict between agents and are unable
to generalize to stochastic events. In this paper, we propose a Local State
Attention module to assist the input state representation. By relying on the
self-attention operator, the module is expected to compress the essential
information of nearby agents to resolve the conflict in traffic situations.
Utilizing a simulated highway merging scenario with the priority vehicle as the
unexpected event, our approach is able to prioritize other vehicles'
information to manage the merging process. The results demonstrate significant
improvements in merging efficiency compared to popular baselines, especially in
high-density traffic settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪枝方法依赖局部启发式或权重标准，无法捕捉全局结构依赖，导致剪枝效果不佳。

Method: 利用图卷积网络（GCNs）建模网络拓扑，学习通道全局重要性，实现自动化剪枝，并通过搜索确定最佳剪枝率组合。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、ImageNet等数据集上，SACP在压缩效率和精度保持上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SACP通过结构感知和自动化剪枝，显著提升了剪枝效果，适用于资源受限设备部署。

Abstract: Channel pruning is a powerful technique to reduce the computational overhead
of deep neural networks, enabling efficient deployment on resource-constrained
devices. However, existing pruning methods often rely on local heuristics or
weight-based criteria that fail to capture global structural dependencies
within the network, leading to suboptimal pruning decisions and degraded model
performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel structure-aware
automatic channel pruning (SACP) framework that utilizes graph convolutional
networks (GCNs) to model the network topology and learn the global importance
of each channel. By encoding structural relationships within the network, our
approach implements topology-aware pruning and this pruning is fully automated,
reducing the need for human intervention. We restrict the pruning rate
combinations to a specific space, where the number of combinations can be
dynamically adjusted, and use a search-based approach to determine the optimal
pruning rate combinations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
(CIFAR-10, ImageNet) with various models (ResNet, VGG16) demonstrate that SACP
outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods on compression efficiency and
competitive on accuracy retention.

Conclusion: 展示了传统推理模式的潜力，所有组件将开源。

Abstract: Recent advancements, such as DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B and
Kimina-Prover-Preview-72B, demonstrate a prevailing trend in leveraging
reinforcement learning (RL)-based large-scale training for automated theorem
proving. Surprisingly, we discover that even without any training, careful
neuro-symbolic coordination of existing off-the-shelf reasoning models and
tactic step provers can achieve comparable performance. This paper introduces
\textbf{DSP+}, an improved version of the Draft, Sketch, and Prove framework,
featuring a \emph{fine-grained and integrated} neuro-symbolic enhancement for
each phase: (1) In the draft phase, we prompt reasoning models to generate
concise natural-language subgoals to benefit the sketch phase, removing
thinking tokens and references to human-written proofs; (2) In the sketch
phase, subgoals are autoformalized with hypotheses to benefit the proving
phase, and sketch lines containing syntactic errors are masked according to
predefined rules; (3) In the proving phase, we tightly integrate symbolic
search methods like Aesop with step provers to establish proofs for the sketch
subgoals. Experimental results show that, without any additional model training
or fine-tuning, DSP+ solves 80.7\%, 32.8\%, and 24 out of 644 problems from
miniF2F, ProofNet, and PutnamBench, respectively, while requiring fewer budgets
compared to state-of-the-arts. DSP+ proves \texttt{imo\_2019\_p1}, an IMO
problem in miniF2F that is not solved by any prior work. Additionally, DSP+
generates proof patterns comprehensible by human experts, facilitating the
identification of formalization errors; For example, eight wrongly formalized
statements in miniF2F are discovered. Our results highlight the potential of
classical reasoning patterns besides the RL-based training. All components will
be open-sourced.

Motivation: 现有RAG范式忽略了知识应用的认知步骤，导致检索事实与任务推理之间存在脱节。

Method: RAG+构建了一个包含知识和应用示例的双重语料库，并在推理过程中联合检索两者。

Result: 在数学、法律和医学领域的实验中，RAG+平均提升3-5%，复杂场景下峰值提升7.5%。

Conclusion: RAG+通过将检索与可操作应用结合，为知识集成提供了更认知基础化的框架，推动了更可解释和强大的LLMs发展。

Abstract: The integration of external knowledge through Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) has become foundational in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for
knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing RAG paradigms often overlook the
cognitive step of applying knowledge, leaving a gap between retrieved facts and
task-specific reasoning. In this work, we introduce RAG+, a principled and
modular extension that explicitly incorporates application-aware reasoning into
the RAG pipeline. RAG+ constructs a dual corpus consisting of knowledge and
aligned application examples, created either manually or automatically, and
retrieves both jointly during inference. This design enables LLMs not only to
access relevant information but also to apply it within structured,
goal-oriented reasoning processes. Experiments across mathematical, legal, and
medical domains, conducted on multiple models, demonstrate that RAG+
consistently outperforms standard RAG variants, achieving average improvements
of 3-5%, and peak gains up to 7.5% in complex scenarios. By bridging retrieval
with actionable application, RAG+ advances a more cognitively grounded
framework for knowledge integration, representing a step toward more
interpretable and capable LLMs.

Result: 方法在保持高准确性的同时，显著减少了对付费大模型的依赖。

Conclusion: 规划是协调成本感知、跨模型推理的有效先验方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks, but those with
strong capabilities (e.g., whose numbers of parameters are larger than 100B)
are often accessible only through paid APIs, making them too costly for
applications of frequent use. In contrast, smaller open-sourced LLMs (e.g.,
whose numbers of parameters are less than 3B) are freely available and easy to
deploy locally (e.g., under a single GPU having 8G VRAM), but lack suff icient
reasoning ability. This trade-off raises a natural question: can small (free)
and large (costly) models collaborate at test time to combine their strengths?
We propose a test-time collaboration framework in which a planner model first
generates a plan, defined as a distilled and high-level abstraction of the
problem.
  This plan serves as a lightweight intermediate that guides a reasoner model,
which generates a complete solution. Small and large models take turns acting
as planner and reasoner, exchanging plans in a multi-round cascade to
collaboratively solve complex tasks. Our method achieves accuracy comparable to
strong proprietary models alone, while significantly reducing reliance on paid
inference. These results highlight planning as an effective prior for
orchestrating cost-aware, cross-model inference under real-world deployment
constraints.

Motivation: 现有英语基准数据集多为脱离上下文或人为困难的问题，而德语环境下缺乏类似评估工具，因此需要开发一个更贴近真实学习场景的基准。

Method: 从九个学科领域（如数学、历史、生物）的中小学课程中构建数据集，包含开放性问题与图像，评估13种先进VLM的多维度表现。

Result: 最强模型整体准确率低于45%，在音乐、数学和对抗性问题中表现尤其差，显示流行基准与真实多模态理解存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 中学级任务是测试VLM的有意义且未被充分利用的途径，尤其在非英语环境中。数据集为未来AI系统的视觉和语言推理能力提供了严格测试平台。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the
capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on tasks that combine visual
reasoning with subject-specific background knowledge in the German language. In
contrast to widely used English-language benchmarks that often rely on
artificially difficult or decontextualized problems, this dataset draws from
real middle school curricula across nine domains including mathematics,
history, biology, and religion. The benchmark includes over 2,000 open-ended
questions grounded in 486 images, ensuring that models must integrate visual
interpretation with factual reasoning rather than rely on superficial textual
cues. We evaluate thirteen state-of-the-art open-weight VLMs across multiple
dimensions, including domain-specific accuracy and performance on adversarial
crafted questions. Our findings reveal that even the strongest models achieve
less than 45% overall accuracy, with particularly poor performance in music,
mathematics, and adversarial settings. Furthermore, the results indicate
significant discrepancies between success on popular benchmarks and real-world
multimodal understanding. We conclude that middle school-level tasks offer a
meaningful and underutilized avenue for stress-testing VLMs, especially in
non-English contexts. The dataset and evaluation protocol serve as a rigorous
testbed to better understand and improve the visual and linguistic reasoning
capabilities of future AI systems.

Result: 在五个基准测试中，SymMPO表现出优越性能，验证了其在减少MLLMs幻觉方面的有效性。

Conclusion: SymMPO通过对称偏好优化和直接监督，显著提升了MLLMs的视觉理解能力，减少了幻觉现象。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an effective approach for
mitigating hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Although
existing methods have achieved significant progress by utilizing
vision-oriented contrastive objectives for enhancing MLLMs' attention to visual
inputs and hence reducing hallucination, they suffer from non-rigorous
optimization objective function and indirect preference supervision. To address
these limitations, we propose a Symmetric Multimodal Preference Optimization
(SymMPO), which conducts symmetric preference learning with direct preference
supervision (i.e., response pairs) for visual understanding enhancement, while
maintaining rigorous theoretical alignment with standard DPO. In addition to
conventional ordinal preference learning, SymMPO introduces a preference margin
consistency loss to quantitatively regulate the preference gap between
symmetric preference pairs. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmarks
demonstrate SymMPO's superior performance, validating its effectiveness in
hallucination mitigation of MLLMs.

Result: R-GNNs无法学习C2特征定义的价值函数，但其他GNN架构可能更有效。

Conclusion: R-GNNs在特定规划任务中存在局限性，需探索其他GNN架构以提升性能。

Abstract: Relational Graph Neural Networks (R-GNNs) are a GNN-based approach for
learning value functions that can generalise to unseen problems from a given
planning domain. R-GNNs were theoretically motivated by the well known
connection between the expressive power of GNNs and $C_2$, first-order logic
with two variables and counting. In the context of planning, $C_2$ features
refer to the set of formulae in $C_2$ with relations defined by the unary and
binary predicates of a planning domain. Some planning domains exhibit optimal
value functions that can be decomposed as arithmetic expressions of $C_2$
features. We show that, contrary to empirical results, R-GNNs cannot learn
value functions defined by $C_2$ features. We also identify prior GNN
architectures for planning that may better learn value functions defined by
$C_2$ features.

Abstract: We investigate the estimation of the causal effect of a treatment variable on
an outcome in the presence of a latent confounder. We first show that the
causal effect is identifiable under certain conditions when data is available
from multiple environments, provided that the target causal effect remains
invariant across these environments. Secondly, we propose a moment-based
algorithm for estimating the causal effect as long as only a single parameter
of the data-generating mechanism varies across environments -- whether it be
the exogenous noise distribution or the causal relationship between two
variables. Conversely, we prove that identifiability is lost if both exogenous
noise distributions of both the latent and treatment variables vary across
environments. Finally, we propose a procedure to identify which parameter of
the data-generating mechanism has varied across the environments and evaluate
the performance of our proposed methods through experiments on synthetic data.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）如何通过优化的上下文学习策略，为房地产市场提供透明、可解释的房价估计，并评估了不同提示技术的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 房地产市场存在信息不对称问题，LLMs有望通过生成可解释的房价估计来改善透明度。

Method: 系统评估了多种LLMs在国际住房数据集上的表现，比较了零样本、少样本、市场报告增强和混合提示技术。

Result: LLMs能有效利用特征变量生成有意义的估计，虽传统模型在预测准确性上更强，但LLMs更具交互性和可解释性。

Conclusion: LLMs在房地产评估中具有潜力，但需谨慎处理其局限性，如过度自信和空间推理不足。

Abstract: The real estate market is vital to global economies but suffers from
significant information asymmetry. This study examines how Large Language
Models (LLMs) can democratize access to real estate insights by generating
competitive and interpretable house price estimates through optimized
In-Context Learning (ICL) strategies. We systematically evaluate leading LLMs
on diverse international housing datasets, comparing zero-shot, few-shot,
market report-enhanced, and hybrid prompting techniques. Our results show that
LLMs effectively leverage hedonic variables, such as property size and
amenities, to produce meaningful estimates. While traditional machine learning
models remain strong for pure predictive accuracy, LLMs offer a more
accessible, interactive and interpretable alternative. Although
self-explanations require cautious interpretation, we find that LLMs explain
their predictions in agreement with state-of-the-art models, confirming their
trustworthiness. Carefully selected in-context examples based on feature
similarity and geographic proximity, significantly enhance LLM performance, yet
LLMs struggle with overconfidence in price intervals and limited spatial
reasoning. We offer practical guidance for structured prediction tasks through
prompt optimization. Our findings highlight LLMs' potential to improve
transparency in real estate appraisal and provide actionable insights for
stakeholders.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在模拟社交行为中的应用日益广泛，但其政治偏见和辩论中的互动动态尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过多智能体辩论框架，系统性地改变LLM类型、智能体性别和辩论形式，分析其对政治偏见的影响。

Result: 中立智能体倾向民主党，共和党智能体向中立靠拢；性别影响态度；相同政治倾向的智能体会形成回音室效应。

Conclusion: LLM的政治偏见和互动动态受模型来源和智能体属性影响，需在设计时注意这些因素。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate social
behaviour, yet their political biases and interaction dynamics in debates
remain underexplored. We investigate how LLM type and agent gender attributes
influence political bias using a structured multi-agent debate framework, by
engaging Neutral, Republican, and Democrat American LLM agents in debates on
politically sensitive topics. We systematically vary the underlying LLMs, agent
genders, and debate formats to examine how model provenance and agent personas
influence political bias and attitudes throughout debates. We find that Neutral
agents consistently align with Democrats, while Republicans shift closer to the
Neutral; gender influences agent attitudes, with agents adapting their opinions
when aware of other agents' genders; and contrary to prior research, agents
with shared political affiliations can form echo chambers, exhibiting the
expected intensification of attitudes as debates progress.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）在高风险环境中的应用增加，其潜在的伦理问题（如人口统计偏差、问责制和隐私）引起了关注。本研究旨在分析这些系统学习数据偏差的能力。

Method: 研究通过AI自动招聘的案例，提出了一种隐私增强框架，以减少学习流程中的性别信息。实验分析了数据偏差对两种不同LLMs构建的系统的影响。

Result: 实验表明，所提出的框架能有效防止训练后的系统再现数据中的偏见。

Conclusion: 隐私增强框架是减轻语言技术中人口统计偏见的有效方法。

Abstract: The use of language technologies in high-stake settings is increasing in
recent years, mostly motivated by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, despite the great performance of LLMs, they are are susceptible to
ethical concerns, such as demographic biases, accountability, or privacy. This
work seeks to analyze the capacity of Transformers-based systems to learn
demographic biases present in the data, using a case study on AI-based
automated recruitment. We propose a privacy-enhancing framework to reduce
gender information from the learning pipeline as a way to mitigate biased
behaviors in the final tools. Our experiments analyze the influence of data
biases on systems built on two different LLMs, and how the proposed framework
effectively prevents trained systems from reproducing the bias in the data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种级联LLM决策框架，通过自适应任务委派平衡预测正确性、成本与置信度，结合在线学习机制优化决策质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平衡预测正确性、知识成本和推理复杂性，并处理自动化答案的置信度问题。

Method: 采用两阶段策略：延迟策略决定是否接受基础模型答案或使用更大模型重新生成；弃权策略决定是否需要人工干预。结合在线学习机制。

Result: 在通用问答和医学问答任务中，级联策略在准确性和成本上优于单模型基线。

Conclusion: 级联框架提供了一种高效、成本优化的决策方法，并能通过反馈持续改进。

Abstract: Effective human-AI decision-making balances three key factors: the
\textit{correctness} of predictions, the \textit{cost} of knowledge and
reasoning complexity, and the confidence about whether to \textit{abstain}
automated answers or involve human experts. In this work, we present a cascaded
LLM decision framework that adaptively delegates tasks across multiple tiers of
expertise -- a base model for initial candidate answers, a more capable and
knowledgeable (but costlier) large model, and a human expert for when the model
cascade abstains. Our method proceeds in two stages. First, a deferral policy
determines whether to accept the base model's answer or regenerate it with the
large model based on the confidence score. Second, an abstention policy decides
whether the cascade model response is sufficiently certain or requires human
intervention. Moreover, we incorporate an online learning mechanism in the
framework that can leverage human feedback to improve decision quality over
time. We demonstrate this approach to general question-answering (ARC-Easy and
ARC-Challenge) and medical question-answering (MedQA and MedMCQA). Our results
show that our cascaded strategy outperforms in most cases single-model
baselines in accuracy while reducing cost and providing a principled way to
handle abstentions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Schema-R1是一种基于强化学习的模式链接模型，通过高质量推理样本和监督微调提升推理能力，比现有方法过滤准确率提高10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模式链接模型过度优化真实结果而牺牲推理能力，缺乏高质量推理样本。

Method: 构建高质量推理样本小批量，监督微调冷启动初始化，基于规则的强化学习训练。

Result: 过滤准确率提升10%。

Conclusion: Schema-R1有效增强模式链接模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Schema linking is a critical step in Text-to-SQL task, aiming to accurately
predict the table names and column names required for the SQL query based on
the given question. However, current fine-tuning approaches for schema linking
models employ a rote-learning paradigm, excessively optimizing for ground truth
schema linking outcomes while compromising reasoning ability. This limitation
arises because of the difficulty in acquiring a high-quality reasoning sample
for downstream tasks. To address this, we propose Schema-R1, a reasoning schema
linking model trained using reinforcement learning. Specifically, Schema-R1
consists of three key steps: constructing small batches of high-quality
reasoning samples, supervised fine-tuning for cold-start initialization, and
rule-based reinforcement learning training. The final results demonstrate that
our method effectively enhances the reasoning ability of the schema linking
model, achieving a 10\% improvement in filter accuracy compared to the existing
method. Our code is available at https://github.com/hongWin/Schema-R1/.

TL;DR: 论文提出通过战略游戏评估大语言模型（LLMs）的中间推理过程，包括规划、修订和资源受限决策，并定义了新指标。实验发现模型表现差异显著，频繁修订未必改善结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准多关注最终结果，忽视中间推理过程，而评估这些过程对理解模型行为和提升可靠性至关重要。

Method: 使用战略游戏作为评估环境，提出框架衡量规划、修订和资源受限决策，定义多个新指标（如修正成功率、过度修正风险率等）。

Result: 在4320轮对抗实验中，ChatGPT-o3-mini表现最佳（胜率74.7%），而Qwen-Plus因资源过度使用表现较差。频繁修订与修正成功率呈负相关。

Conclusion: 评估LLMs的决策过程比仅关注结果更有价值，未来研究应更注重中间推理能力的提升。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks that require
complex reasoning. Most benchmarks focus on final outcomes but overlook the
intermediate reasoning steps - such as planning, revision, and decision making
under resource constraints. We argue that measuring these internal processes is
essential for understanding model behavior and improving reliability. We
propose using strategic games as a natural evaluation environment: closed,
rule-based systems with clear states, limited resources, and automatic
feedback. We introduce a framework that evaluates LLMs along three core
dimensions: planning, revision, and resource-constrained decision making. To
operationalize this, we define metrics beyond win rate, including
overcorrection risk rate, correction success rate, improvement slope, and
over-budget ratio. In 4320 adversarial rounds across 12 leading models,
ChatGPT-o3-mini achieves the top composite score, with a win rate of 74.7
percent, a correction success rate of 78.6 percent, and an improvement slope of
0.041. By contrast, Qwen-Plus, despite an overcorrection risk rate of 81.6
percent, wins only 25.6 percent of its matches - primarily due to excessive
resource use. We also observe a negative correlation between overcorrection
risk rate and correction success rate (Pearson r = -0.51, p = 0.093),
suggesting that more frequent edits do not always improve outcomes. Our
findings highlight the value of assessing not only what LLMs decide but how
they arrive at those decisions

Conclusion: 呼吁建立更严格的模型性能评估范式以确保结果可靠性。

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant
fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation
conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model
performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

Abstract: Dyslexia, affecting an estimated 10% to 20% of the global population,
significantly impairs learning capabilities, highlighting the need for
innovative and accessible diagnostic methods. This paper investigates the
effectiveness of eye-tracking technology combined with machine learning
algorithms as a cost-effective alternative for early dyslexia detection. By
analyzing general eye movement patterns, including prolonged fixation durations
and erratic saccades, we proposed an enhanced solution for determining
eye-tracking-based dyslexia features. A Random Forest Classifier was then
employed to detect dyslexia, achieving an accuracy of 88.58\%. Additionally,
hierarchical clustering methods were applied to identify varying severity
levels of dyslexia. The analysis incorporates diverse methodologies across
various populations and settings, demonstrating the potential of this
technology to identify individuals with dyslexia, including those with
borderline traits, through non-invasive means. Integrating eye-tracking with
machine learning represents a significant advancement in the diagnostic
process, offering a highly accurate and accessible method in clinical research.

Conclusion: 强调了数据科学生态系统的复杂性，并提出了实用性评估的重要性，以促进计算与基础数据科学的融合。

Abstract: This manuscript provides a holistic (data-centric) view of what we term
essential data science, as a natural ecosystem with challenges and missions
stemming from the data universe with its multiple combinations of the 5D
complexities (data structure, domain, cardinality, causality, and ethics) with
the phases of the data life cycle. Data agents perform tasks driven by specific
goals. The data scientist is an abstract entity that comes from the logical
organization of data agents with their actions. Data scientists face challenges
that are defined according to the missions. We define specific
discipline-induced data science, which in turn allows for the definition of
pan-data science, a natural ecosystem that integrates specific disciplines with
the essential data science. We semantically split the essential data science
into computational, and foundational. We claim that there is a serious threat
of divergence between computational and foundational data science. Especially,
if no approach is taken to rate whether a data universe discovery should be
useful or not. We suggest that rigorous approaches to measure the usefulness of
data universe discoveries might mitigate such a divergence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集中式训练的基础模型存在隐私和高传输成本问题，而现有的PFL研究多局限于模拟环境，忽略了真实场景中的数据与模型异构性。

Method: 提出任务相似性感知的模型聚合方法处理数据异构性，以及维度不变模块处理模型异构性。

Result: 在包含40个任务的真实多模态PFL基准测试中，该方法在个性化和泛化能力上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为真实场景中的PFL提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities across diverse
multi-modal tasks, but their centralized training raises privacy concerns and
induces high transmission costs. In contrast, federated learning (FL) offers a
distributed alternative without the need to share data. Recently, for the
growing demand for personalizing AI models for different user purposes,
personalized federated learning (PFL) has emerged. PFL allows each client to
leverage the knowledge of other clients for further adaptation to individual
user preferences, again without the need to share data. Despite its potential,
most PFL studies remain confined to simulated environments, overlooking the
data and model heterogeneity that arise in real-world scenarios. In contrast,
we first consider large data heterogeneity, evaluating on a new benchmark for
multi-modal PFL, spanning 40 distinct tasks with realistic data distribution
shifts. We then consider model heterogeneity in that we do not assume that all
clients share similar model architectures. To address data heterogeneity, we
propose a task-similarity-aware model aggregation method that provides
customized global models to each client. For model heterogeneity, we propose a
dimension-invariant module that enables knowledge sharing across heterogeneous
models. Empirical validations demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art, excelling in both personalization and
generalization capabilities.

Abstract: This paper examines how synthetically generated faces and machine

lookism, the preferential treatment based on appearance. In experiments with
13,200 synthetically generated faces, we find that: (1) text-to-image (T2I)
systems tend to associate facial attractiveness to unrelated positive traits
like intelligence and trustworthiness; and (2) gender classification models
exhibit higher error rates on "less-attractive" faces, especially among
non-White women. These result raise fairness concerns regarding digital

Result: 扩散模型在分类效用上表现最佳（macro-F1达88.2%），CTGAN对重建攻击的抵抗能力最强。

Conclusion: 结构化生成模型在开发隐私保护、数据驱动的能源系统中具有潜力。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of dynamic Time-of-Use (dToU) electricity tariffs
requires accurately identifying households that would benefit from such pricing
structures. However, the use of real consumption data poses serious privacy
concerns, motivating the adoption of synthetic alternatives. In this study, we
conduct a comparative evaluation of four synthetic data generation methods,
Wasserstein-GP Generative Adversarial Networks (WGAN), Conditional Tabular GAN

synthetic regimes. We assess classification utility, distribution fidelity, and
privacy leakage. Our results show that architectural design plays a key role:
diffusion models achieve the highest utility (macro-F1 up to 88.2%), while
CTGAN provide the strongest resistance to reconstruction attacks. These

Method: 使用Qwen 2.5小规模代码模型结合GRPO，通过显式推理步骤优化代码生成，并将推理反馈集成到强化学习循环中。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了代码的逻辑一致性、语法准确性和推理质量。

Conclusion: 该方法为缺乏训练资源的编程语言提供了一种有效的代码生成解决方案。

Abstract: Generating accurate and executable code using large language models (LLMs) is
challenging for languages with limited public training data compared to popular
languages such as Python. This paper introduces a generalizable approach that
uses small-scale code versions of the Qwen 2.5 model combined with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enable effective code generation through
explicit reasoning steps, which is particularly beneficial for languages with
smaller source code databases. Using Prolog as a representative use case --
given its limited online presence -- the initial model faced challenges in
generating executable code. After some training steps, the model successfully
produces logically consistent and syntactically accurate code by directly
integrating reasoning-driven feedback into the reinforcement learning loop.
Experimental evaluations using mathematical logic problem benchmarks illustrate
significant improvements in reasoning quality, code accuracy, and logical
correctness, underscoring the potential of this approach to benefit a wide
range of programming languages lacking extensive training resources.

Conclusion: 研究为传染病预测中的移动数据表示提供了新视角，有助于决策者应对未来疫情。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of contagious disease outbreaks is vital for informed
decision-making. Our study addresses the gap between machine learning
algorithms and their epidemiological applications, noting that methods optimal
for benchmark datasets often underperform with real-world data due to
difficulties in incorporating mobility information. We adopt a two-phase
approach: first, assessing the significance of mobility data through a pilot
study, then evaluating the impact of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) on a
transformer backbone. Our findings reveal that while mobility data and GCN
modules do not significantly enhance forecasting performance, the inclusion of
mortality and hospitalization data markedly improves model accuracy.
Additionally, a comparative analysis between GCN-derived spatial maps and
lockdown orders suggests a notable correlation, highlighting the potential of
spatial maps as sensitive indicators for mobility. Our research offers a novel
perspective on mobility representation in predictive modeling for contagious
diseases, empowering decision-makers to better prepare for future outbreaks.

Result: 在ETT和Weather数据集上零样本任务表现优异，300M参数模型在GIFT-Eval基准测试中显著优于其他模型。

Conclusion: YingLong展示了长输出和非因果方法对时间序列预测的重要性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: We present a joint forecasting framework for time series prediction that
contrasts with traditional direct or recursive methods. This framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance for our designed foundation model, YingLong, and
reveals a novel scaling effect: longer outputs significantly enhance model
accuracy due to delayed chain-of-thought reasoning in our non-causal approach.
YingLong is a non-causal, bidirectional attention encoder-only transformer
trained through masked token recovery, aligning more effectively with language
understanding tasks than with generation tasks. Additionally, we boost
performance by tackling output variance with a multi-input ensemble. We release
four foundation models ranging from 6M to 300M parameters, demonstrating
superior results in zero-shot tasks on the ETT and Weather datasets. YingLong
achieves more than 60% best performance. To ensure generalizability, we
assessed the models using the GIFT-Eval benchmark, which comprises 23 time
series datasets across 7 domains. Yinglong significantly outperformed the best
time-series foundation models, end-to-end trained models by 14% and 44% in rank

Result: FTP在MNIST、CIFAR10和CIFAR100等任务上表现与BP相当，且在低精度和硬件约束下优于BP。

Conclusion: FTP以其高效性和硬件兼容性，为节能设备和神经形态计算提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Training neural networks has traditionally relied on backpropagation (BP), a
gradient-based algorithm that, despite its widespread success, suffers from key
limitations in both biological and hardware perspectives. These include
backward error propagation by symmetric weights, non-local credit assignment,
and frozen activity during backward passes. We propose Forward Target
Propagation (FTP), a biologically plausible and computationally efficient
alternative that replaces the backward pass with a second forward pass. FTP
estimates layerwise targets using only feedforward computations, eliminating
the need for symmetric feedback weights or learnable inverse functions, hence
enabling modular and local learning. We evaluate FTP on fully connected
networks, CNNs, and RNNs, demonstrating accuracies competitive with BP on
MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, as well as effective modeling of long-term
dependencies in sequential tasks. Moreover, FTP outperforms BP under quantized
low-precision and emerging hardware constraints while also demonstrating
substantial efficiency gains over other biologically inspired methods such as
target propagation variants and forward-only learning algorithms. With its
minimal computational overhead, forward-only nature, and hardware
compatibility, FTP provides a promising direction for energy-efficient
on-device learning and neuromorphic computing.

*Zoher Kachwala,Danishjeet Singh,Danielle Yang,Filippo Menczer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种零样本检测AI生成图像的方法，通过任务对齐提示（zero-shot-s²）显著提升性能，无需微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像生成器生成越来越逼真的图像，对其潜在滥用的担忧增加。传统监督检测方法依赖大型数据集且泛化能力有限。

Method: 利用预训练视觉语言模型（VLMs）进行零样本检测，通过任务对齐提示（如zero-shot-s²）优化模型推理。

Result: zero-shot-s²方法在多个数据集和模型上显著提升性能（Macro F1提高8%-29%），并表现出良好的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 任务对齐提示能激发VLM的潜在能力，为AI生成图像检测提供了一种简单、通用且可解释的替代方案。

Abstract: As image generators produce increasingly realistic images, concerns about
potential misuse continue to grow. Supervised detection relies on large,
curated datasets and struggles to generalize across diverse generators. In this
work, we investigate the use of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for
zero-shot detection of AI-generated images. While off-the-shelf VLMs exhibit
some task-specific reasoning and chain-of-thought prompting offers gains, we
show that task-aligned prompting elicits more focused reasoning and
significantly improves performance without fine-tuning. Specifically, prefixing
the model's response with the phrase ``Let's examine the style and the
synthesis artifacts'' -- a method we call zero-shot-s$^2$ -- boosts Macro F1
scores by 8%-29% for two widely used open-source models. These gains are
consistent across three recent, diverse datasets spanning human faces, objects,
and animals with images generated by 16 different models -- demonstrating
strong generalization. We further evaluate the approach across three additional
model sizes and observe improvements in most dataset-model combinations --
suggesting robustness to model scale. Surprisingly, self-consistency, a
behavior previously observed in language reasoning, where aggregating answers
from diverse reasoning paths improves performance, also holds in this setting.
Even here, zero-shot-s$^2$ scales better than chain-of-thought in most cases --
indicating that it elicits more useful diversity. Our findings show that
task-aligned prompts elicit more focused reasoning and enhance latent
capabilities in VLMs, like the detection of AI-generated images -- offering a
simple, generalizable, and explainable alternative to supervised methods. Our
code is publicly available on github:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种运行时屏蔽机制，用于强化学习中隐藏参数变化的安全风险，通过实时推断和预测确保安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐藏参数（如机器人质量分布或摩擦）的变化在执行中可能带来安全风险，需要一种机制来实时适应和约束动作空间。

Method: 基于约束隐藏参数马尔可夫决策过程，使用函数编码器实时推断隐藏参数，并通过共形预测考虑不确定性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少安全违规，并实现强泛化能力，同时运行时开销极小。

Conclusion: 该机制满足概率安全保证，并在安全合规策略中实现最优策略。

Abstract: Variations in hidden parameters, such as a robot's mass distribution or
friction, pose safety risks during execution. We develop a runtime shielding
mechanism for reinforcement learning, building on the formalism of constrained
hidden-parameter Markov decision processes. Function encoders enable real-time
inference of hidden parameters from observations, allowing the shield and the
underlying policy to adapt online. The shield constrains the action space by
forecasting future safety risks (such as obstacle proximity) and accounts for
uncertainty via conformal prediction. We prove that the proposed mechanism
satisfies probabilistic safety guarantees and yields optimal policies among the
set of safety-compliant policies. Experiments across diverse environments with
varying hidden parameters show that our method significantly reduces safety
violations and achieves strong out-of-distribution generalization, while
incurring minimal runtime overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在因果推理任务中表现出潜力，但LVLMs在视觉因果推理任务中的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 构建了包含因果结构推断、干预目标预测和反事实预测三个任务的基准CausalVLBench，并在三个因果表示学习数据集上评估了LVLMs。

Result: 展示了现有LVLMs在视觉因果推理任务中的优势和不足。

Conclusion: 该基准揭示了现有视觉语言模型的缺陷，并推动了改进LVLMs视觉因果推理能力的新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in various
language tasks, especially with their emergent in-context learning capability.
Extending LLMs to incorporate visual inputs, large vision-language models
(LVLMs) have shown impressive performance in tasks such as recognition and
visual question answering (VQA). Despite increasing interest in the utility of
LLMs in causal reasoning tasks such as causal discovery and counterfactual
reasoning, there has been relatively little work showcasing the abilities of
LVLMs on visual causal reasoning tasks. We take this opportunity to formally
introduce a comprehensive causal reasoning benchmark for multi-modal in-context
learning from LVLMs. Our CausalVLBench encompasses three representative tasks:
causal structure inference, intervention target prediction, and counterfactual
prediction. We evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs on
our causal reasoning tasks across three causal representation learning datasets
and demonstrate their fundamental strengths and weaknesses. We hope that our
benchmark elucidates the drawbacks of existing vision-language models and
motivates new directions and paradigms in improving the visual causal reasoning
abilities of LVLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可微分的Tversky相似性参数化方法，用于深度学习，通过实验验证其在图像分类和语言建模中的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理学研究表明，深度学习中常用的几何相似性模型与人类感知不符，而Tversky的基于特征的相似性理论更符合心理现实性，但尚未应用于深度学习。

Method: 开发了可微分的Tversky相似性参数化方法，并设计了Tversky投影层，通过梯度下降学习。

Result: 在NABirds图像分类任务中，Tversky投影层相对线性层提升了24.7%的准确率；在GPT-2上，困惑度降低了7.5%，参数减少了34.8%。

Conclusion: Tversky投影层为深度学习提供了一种更符合心理相似性的新范式，并增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Work in psychology has highlighted that the geometric model of similarity
standard in deep learning is not psychologically plausible because its metric
properties such as symmetry do not align with human perception. In contrast,
Tversky (1977) proposed an axiomatic theory of similarity based on a
representation of objects as sets of features, and their similarity as a
function of common and distinctive features. However, this model has not been
used in deep learning before, partly due to the challenge of incorporating
discrete set operations. We develop a differentiable parameterization of
Tversky's similarity that is learnable through gradient descent, and derive
neural network building blocks such as the Tversky projection layer, which
unlike the linear projection layer can model non-linear functions such as XOR.
Through experiments with image recognition and language modeling, we show that
the Tversky projection layer is a beneficial replacement for the linear
projection layer, which employs geometric similarity. On the NABirds image
classification task, a frozen ResNet-50 adapted with a Tversky projection layer
achieves a 24.7% relative accuracy improvement over the linear layer adapter
baseline. With Tversky projection layers, GPT-2's perplexity on PTB decreases
by 7.5%, and its parameter count by 34.8%. Finally, we propose a unified
interpretation of both projection layers as computing similarities of input
stimuli to learned prototypes, for which we also propose a novel visualization
technique highlighting the interpretability of Tversky projection layers. Our
work offers a new paradigm for thinking about the similarity model implicit in
deep learning, and designing networks that are interpretable under an
established theory of psychological similarity.

Motivation: 现有方法因网络架构和数据质量的固有限制，难以区分具有挑战性的候选图像。

Method: 提出了一个即插即用的测试时人机交互（THI）模块，利用多模态大语言模型（MLLM）进行多轮交互以对齐查询意图；并引入重组数据增强（RDA）策略，通过信息丰富和多样性增强提升查询区分能力。

Conclusion: ICL框架通过人机交互和数据增强有效解决了现有方法的局限性，显著提升了行人重识别的准确性。

Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements in text-to-image person re-identification
(TIReID) facilitated by the breakthrough of cross-modal embedding models,
existing methods often struggle to distinguish challenging candidate images due
to intrinsic limitations, such as network architecture and data quality. To
address these issues, we propose an Interactive Cross-modal Learning framework
(ICL), which leverages human-centered interaction to enhance the
discriminability of text queries through external multimodal knowledge. To
achieve this, we propose a plug-and-play Test-time Humane-centered Interaction
(THI) module, which performs visual question answering focused on human
characteristics, facilitating multi-round interactions with a multimodal large
language model (MLLM) to align query intent with latent target images.
Specifically, THI refines user queries based on the MLLM responses to reduce
the gap to the best-matching images, thereby boosting ranking accuracy.
Additionally, to address the limitation of low-quality training texts, we
introduce a novel Reorganization Data Augmentation (RDA) strategy based on
information enrichment and diversity enhancement to enhance query
discriminability by enriching, decomposing, and reorganizing person
descriptions. Extensive experiments on four TIReID benchmarks, i.e.,
CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, RSTPReid, and UFine6926, demonstrate that our method
achieves remarkable performance with substantial improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LTV预测对广告商至关重要，但数据稀缺和任务间的高相关性使其成为挑战。

Method: 使用图表示学习解决数据稀缺问题，并通过帕累托优化处理任务间的依赖性。

Result: GRePO-LTV框架能够有效提升LTV预测的准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架为LTV预测提供了一种新的解决方案，解决了数据稀缺和任务依赖性问题。

Abstract: The LifeTime Value (LTV) prediction, which endeavors to forecast the
cumulative purchase contribution of a user to a particular item, remains a
vital challenge that advertisers are keen to resolve. A precise LTV prediction
system enhances the alignment of user interests with meticulously designed
advertisements, thereby generating substantial profits for advertisers.
Nonetheless, this issue is complicated by the paucity of data typically
observed in real-world advertising scenarios. The purchase rate among
registered users is often as critically low as 0.1%, resulting in a dataset
where the majority of users make only several purchases. Consequently, there is
insufficient supervisory signal for effectively training the LTV prediction
model. An additional challenge emerges from the interdependencies among tasks
with high correlation. It is a common practice to estimate a user's
contribution to a game over a specified temporal interval. Varying the lengths
of these intervals corresponds to distinct predictive tasks, which are highly
correlated. For instance, predictions over a 7-day period are heavily reliant
on forecasts made over a 3-day period, where exceptional cases can adversely
affect the accuracy of both tasks. In order to comprehensively address the
aforementioned challenges, we introduce an innovative framework denoted as
Graph-Represented Pareto-Optimal LifeTime Value prediction (GRePO-LTV). Graph
representation learning is initially employed to address the issue of data
scarcity. Subsequently, Pareto-Optimization is utilized to manage the
interdependence of prediction tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于任务特定专家混合（MoTE）的框架，解决了类增量学习中维度不一致和参数覆盖的问题，并通过实验验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 类增量学习（CIL）中，基于预训练模型的方法存在提示覆盖或维度不对齐的问题，而专家混合（MoE）的参数易被覆盖，难以直接应用。

Method: 提出MoTE框架，结合任务感知专家过滤和可靠专家联合推理，避免灾难性遗忘，并探索适配器扩展与性能的权衡。

Result: 实验证明MoTE无需示例集即可表现优越，且任务数量与适配器数量线性扩展。

Conclusion: MoTE有效解决了CIL中的维度不一致问题，并通过Adapter-Limited MoTE进一步优化了性能与扩展的平衡。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) requires deep learning models to
continuously acquire new knowledge from streaming data while preserving
previously learned information. Recently, CIL based on pre-trained models
(PTMs) has achieved remarkable success. However, prompt-based approaches suffer
from prompt overwriting, while adapter-based methods face challenges such as
dimensional misalignment between tasks. While the idea of expert fusion in
Mixture of Experts (MoE) can help address dimensional inconsistency, both
expert and routing parameters are prone to being overwritten in dynamic
environments, making MoE challenging to apply directly in CIL. To tackle these
issues, we propose a mixture of task-specific experts (MoTE) framework that
effectively mitigates the miscalibration caused by inconsistent output
dimensions across tasks. Inspired by the weighted feature fusion and sparse
activation mechanisms in MoE, we introduce task-aware expert filtering and
reliable expert joint inference during the inference phase, mimicking the
behavior of routing layers without inducing catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method without requiring an
exemplar set. Furthermore, the number of tasks in MoTE scales linearly with the
number of adapters. Building on this, we further explore the trade-off between
adapter expansion and model performance and propose the Adapter-Limited MoTE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分类器自由引导（CFG）在文本到图像生成中虽能提升文本-图像对齐，但在高权重下会导致颜色失真。

Method: 通过理论分析发现颜色失真源于潜在空间中样本范数的放大，并提出ADG算法，约束范数变化并优化角度对齐。

Result: 实验表明，ADG在保持文本对齐的同时，显著改善了颜色保真度和人类感知偏好。

Conclusion: ADG是一种有效的方法，解决了CFG在高权重下的颜色失真问题，同时保持了其优势。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has emerged as a pivotal advancement in
text-to-image latent diffusion models, establishing itself as a cornerstone
technique for achieving high-quality image synthesis. However, under high
guidance weights, where text-image alignment is significantly enhanced, CFG
also leads to pronounced color distortions in the generated images. We identify
that these distortions stem from the amplification of sample norms in the
latent space. We present a theoretical framework that elucidates the mechanisms
of norm amplification and anomalous diffusion phenomena induced by
classifier-free guidance. Leveraging our theoretical insights and the latent
space structure, we propose an Angle Domain Guidance (ADG) algorithm. ADG
constrains magnitude variations while optimizing angular alignment, thereby
mitigating color distortions while preserving the enhanced text-image alignment
achieved at higher guidance weights. Experimental results demonstrate that ADG
significantly outperforms existing methods, generating images that not only
maintain superior text alignment but also exhibit improved color fidelity and
better alignment with human perceptual preferences.

Abstract: Time series analysis is pivotal in domains like financial forecasting and
biomedical monitoring, yet traditional methods are constrained by limited
nonlinear feature representation and long-term dependency capture. The
emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential by
leveraging their cross-modal knowledge integration and inherent attention
mechanisms for time series analysis. However, the development of
general-purpose LLMs for time series from scratch is still hindered by data
diversity, annotation scarcity, and computational requirements. This paper
presents a systematic review of pre-trained LLM-driven time series analysis,
focusing on enabling techniques, potential applications, and open challenges.
First, it establishes an evolutionary roadmap of AI-driven time series
analysis, from the early machine learning era, through the emerging LLM-driven
paradigm, to the development of native temporal foundation models. Second, it
organizes and systematizes the technical landscape of LLM-driven time series
analysis from a workflow perspective, covering LLMs' input, optimization, and
lightweight stages. Finally, it critically examines novel real-world
applications and highlights key open challenges that can guide future research
and innovation. The work not only provides valuable insights into current
advances but also outlines promising directions for future development. It
serves as a foundational reference for both academic and industrial
researchers, paving the way for the development of more efficient,
generalizable, and interpretable systems of LLM-driven time series analysis.

Conclusion: ChemHGNN为反应虚拟筛选和发现提供了更优的解决方案，推动了反应发现的加速。

Abstract: Reaction virtual screening and discovery are fundamental challenges in
chemistry and materials science, where traditional graph neural networks (GNNs)
struggle to model multi-reactant interactions. In this work, we propose
ChemHGNN, a hypergraph neural network (HGNN) framework that effectively
captures high-order relationships in reaction networks. Unlike GNNs, which
require constructing complete graphs for multi-reactant reactions, ChemHGNN
naturally models multi-reactant reactions through hyperedges, enabling more
expressive reaction representations. To address key challenges, such as
combinatorial explosion, model collapse, and chemically invalid negative
samples, we introduce a reaction center-aware negative sampling strategy (RCNS)
and a hierarchical embedding approach combining molecule, reaction and
hypergraph level features. Experiments on the USPTO dataset demonstrate that
ChemHGNN significantly outperforms HGNN and GNN baselines, particularly in
large-scale settings, while maintaining interpretability and chemical
plausibility. Our work establishes HGNNs as a superior alternative to GNNs for
reaction virtual screening and discovery, offering a chemically informed
framework for accelerating reaction discovery.

Result: 在CV和NLP任务中表现优异，优于现有PEFT方法。

Conclusion: GenFT为高效模型适应提供了新视角。

Abstract: Pretrained Foundation Models (PFMs) have transformed numerous applications by
enabling efficient adaptation to customized tasks. Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a resource-efficient alternative to full
fine-tuning, especially leveraging reparameterized weights $\Delta W$ to adapt
models for downstream tasks. However, a critical yet underexplored question
remains: can we utilize well-pretrained weights $W_0$ to guide the update of
task-specific $\Delta W$, avoiding inefficient training it from scratch? To end
this, we propose Generative Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (GenFT), a novel
method that extracts structured, transferable information from $W_0$ for
efficient $\Delta W$ training. To extract row and column structure information,
GenFT applies row and column transformations to distill essential patterns from
$W_0$. A tailored policy further decomposes $\Delta W$ into layer-shared and
layer-specific components, balancing information reuse and individualized
flexibility. GenFT is simple yet effective, achieving superior performance
across CV and NLP tasks. Extensive experiments on VTAB-1K, FGVC, and GLUE
benchmarks demonstrate that GenFT outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods,
offering a new perspective for efficient model adaptation.

Conclusion: 零空间视角为量化误差减少提供了新方向，希望激发未来研究。

Abstract: Existing post-training quantization methods for large language models (LLMs)
offer remarkable success. However, the increasingly marginal performance gains
suggest that existing quantization strategies are insufficient to support the
development of more compressed models. To inspire new directions for future
research, this paper introduces the concept of null space into LLMs
quantization. We argue that the quantization error can be effectively
alleviated by constraining the post-quantization weight perturbation to lie
within the null space of input activations. To prove this idea, we propose a
plug-and-play null space projection module for existing milestone PTQ baselines
named Q2N. Specifically, we first design an efficient and accurate null space
projection approximation method tailored to the characteristics of LLMs.
Subsequently, we theoretically derive a closed-form solution for an equivalent
vector of the obtained projection matrix, which satisfies practical inference
condition while avoiding additional memory overhead. Extensive experiments are
conducted on various state-of-the-art LLMs (LLaMA3, DeepSeek, Qwen3) and
baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of both our Q2N and the perspective
of null space optimization for LLMs quantization. We view this paper the first
step to further alleviate the quantization error based on the insights of null
space, hoping it inspiring future researchers to design more advanced
quantization methods. Codes are available at https://github.com/zjq0455/q2n.

Abstract: Although the power of LLM tool-use agents has ignited a flurry of recent
research in this area, the curation of tool-use training data remains an open
problem$-$especially for online RL training. Existing approaches to synthetic
tool-use data generation tend to be non-interactive, and/or non-compositional.
We introduce RandomWorld, a pipeline for the procedural generation of
interactive tools and compositional tool-use data. We show that models tuned
via SFT and RL on synthetic RandomWorld data improve on a range of tool-use
benchmarks, and set the new SoTA for two metrics on the NESTFUL dataset.
Further experiments show that downstream performance scales with the amount of
RandomWorld-generated training data, opening up the possibility of further
improvement through the use of entirely synthetic data.

Abstract: Confidence estimation is crucial for reflecting the reliability of large
language models (LLMs), particularly in the widely used closed-source models.
Utilizing data augmentation for confidence estimation is viable, but
discussions focus on specific augmentation techniques, limiting its potential.
We study the impact of different data augmentation methods on confidence
estimation. Our findings indicate that data augmentation strategies can achieve
better performance and mitigate the impact of overconfidence. We investigate
the influential factors related to this and discover that, while preserving
semantic information, greater data diversity enhances the effectiveness of
augmentation. Furthermore, the impact of different augmentation strategies
varies across different range of application. Considering parameter
transferability and usability, the random combination of augmentations is a
promising choice.

### [227] [Perception-Driven Bias Detection in Machine Learning via Crowdsourced Visual Judgment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11047)
*Chirudeep Tupakula,Rittika Shamsuddin*

Abstract: Machine learning systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains,
yet they remain vulnerable to bias systematic disparities that
disproportionately impact specific demographic groups. Traditional bias
detection methods often depend on access to sensitive labels or rely on rigid
fairness metrics, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. This
paper introduces a novel, perception-driven framework for bias detection that
leverages crowdsourced human judgment. Inspired by reCAPTCHA and other
crowd-powered systems, we present a lightweight web platform that displays
stripped-down visualizations of numeric data (for example-salary distributions
across demographic clusters) and collects binary judgments on group similarity.
We explore how users' visual perception-shaped by layout, spacing, and question
phrasing can signal potential disparities. User feedback is aggregated to flag
data segments as biased, which are then validated through statistical tests and
machine learning cross-evaluations. Our findings show that perceptual signals
from non-expert users reliably correlate with known bias cases, suggesting that
visual intuition can serve as a powerful, scalable proxy for fairness auditing.
This approach offers a label-efficient, interpretable alternative to
conventional fairness diagnostics, paving the way toward human-aligned,
crowdsourced bias detection pipelines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统实数神经网络在低信噪比环境下难以捕捉无线信号的关键特性（如相位和幅度），限制了频谱感知的性能。

Method: 提出CMuSeNet，采用复数神经网络和残差架构，引入复数傅里叶谱焦点损失（CFL）和复数平面交并比（CIoU）度量。

Result: 在合成、室内和真实数据集上，CMuSeNet平均准确率达98.98%-99.90%，训练时间减少92.2%，仅需2个epoch即可达到RVNN的27个epoch的精度。

Conclusion: 复数神经网络架构在低信噪比环境下的频谱感知中表现出显著优势，提升了检测性能和训练效率。

Abstract: The increasing congestion of the radio frequency spectrum presents challenges
for efficient spectrum utilization. Cognitive radio systems enable dynamic
spectrum access with the aid of recent innovations in neural networks. However,
traditional real-valued neural networks (RVNNs) face difficulties in low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments, as they were not specifically
developed to capture essential wireless signal properties such as phase and
amplitude. This work presents CMuSeNet, a complex-valued multi-signal
segmentation network for wideband spectrum sensing, to address these
limitations. Extensive hyperparameter analysis shows that a naive conversion of
existing RVNNs into their complex-valued counterparts is ineffective. Built on
complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) with a residual architecture, CMuSeNet
introduces a complexvalued Fourier spectrum focal loss (CFL) and a complex
plane intersection over union (CIoU) similarity metric to enhance training
performance. Extensive evaluations on synthetic, indoor overthe-air, and
real-world datasets show that CMuSeNet achieves an average accuracy of
98.98%-99.90%, improving by up to 9.2 percentage points over its real-valued
counterpart and consistently outperforms state of the art. Strikingly, CMuSeNet
achieves the accuracy level of its RVNN counterpart in just two epochs,
compared to the 27 epochs required for RVNN, while reducing training time by up
to a 92.2% over the state of the art. The results highlight the effectiveness
of complex-valued architectures in improving weak signal detection and training
efficiency for spectrum sensing in challenging low-SNR environments. The
dataset is available at: https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/hcc1-6p22

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电价预测方法依赖历史数值数据，忽略了文本信号，需多模态方法提升预测能力。

Result: 新闻特征对传统模型效果有限，LLMs表现略有提升但存在幻觉问题。

Conclusion: NSW-EPNews为多模态数值推理提供了测试平台，揭示了LLMs在高风险能源预测中的能力差距。

Abstract: Electricity price forecasting is a critical component of modern
energy-management systems, yet existing approaches heavily rely on numerical
histories and ignore contemporaneous textual signals. We introduce NSW-EPNews,
the first benchmark that jointly evaluates time-series models and large
language models (LLMs) on real-world electricity-price prediction. The dataset
includes over 175,000 half-hourly spot prices from New South Wales, Australia
(2015-2024), daily temperature readings, and curated market-news summaries from
WattClarity. We frame the task as 48-step-ahead forecasting, using multimodal
input, including lagged prices, vectorized news and weather features for
classical models, and prompt-engineered structured contexts for LLMs. Our
datasets yields 3.6k multimodal prompt-output pairs for LLM evaluation using
specific templates. Through compresive benchmark design, we identify that for
traditional statistical and machine learning models, the benefits gain is
marginal from news feature. For state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4o and
Gemini 1.5 Pro, we observe modest performance increase while it also produce
frequent hallucinations such as fabricated and malformed price sequences.
NSW-EPNews provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating grounded numerical
reasoning in multimodal settings, and highlights a critical gap between current
LLM capabilities and the demands of high-stakes energy forecasting.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities, yet their direct application to NP-hard combinatorial problems
(CPs) remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the
reasoning abilities of LLMs on a variety of NP-hard combinatorial optimization
tasks and introduce ACCORD: Autoregressive Constraint-satisfying generation for
COmbinatorial optimization with Routing and Dynamic attention. ACCORD features
a novel dataset representation and model architecture that leverage the
autoregressive nature of LLMs to dynamically enforce feasibility constraints,
coupled with attention-based routing to activate problem-specific LoRA modules.
We also present the ACCORD-90k supervised dataset, covering six NP-hard
combinatorial problems: TSP, VRP, Knapsack, FlowShop, JSSP, and BinPacking.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ACCORD model, built on an
8B-parameter Llama backbone, consistently outperforms standard prompting and
input-output methods, even when compared to much larger LLMs, such as gpt-4.
Ablation studies further show that our output structure enhances solution
feasibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale,
end-to-end framework for exploring the applications of LLMs to a broad spectrum
of combinatorial optimization problems. The codes are publicly available at

Abstract: User Behavior Sequence (UBS) modeling is crucial in industrial applications.
As data scale and task diversity grow, UBS pretraining methods have become
increasingly pivotal. State-of-the-art UBS pretraining methods rely on
predicting behavior distributions. The key step in these methods is
constructing a selected behavior vocabulary. However, this manual step is
labor-intensive and prone to bias. The limitation of vocabulary capacity also
directly affects models' generalization ability. In this paper, we introduce
Bootstrapping Your Behavior (\model{}), a novel UBS pretraining strategy that
predicts an automatically constructed supervision embedding summarizing all
behaviors' information within a future time window, eliminating the manual
behavior vocabulary selection. In implementation, we incorporate a
student-teacher encoder scheme to construct the pretraining supervision
effectively. Experiments on two real-world industrial datasets and eight
downstream tasks demonstrate that \model{} achieves an average improvement of
3.9\% in AUC and 98.9\% in training throughput. Notably, the model exhibits
meaningful attention patterns and cluster representations during pretraining
without any label supervision. In our online deployment over two months, the
pretrained model improves the KS by about 2.7\% and 7.1\% over the baseline
model for two financial overdue risk prediction tasks in the Alipay mobile
application, which reduces bad debt risk by millions of dollars for Ant group.

Abstract: The dynamic nature of Internet of Things (IoT) environments challenges the
long-term effectiveness of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) compositions.
The uncertainty and variability of IoT environments lead to fluctuations in
data distribution, e.g., concept drift and data heterogeneity, and evolving
system requirements, e.g., scalability demands and resource limitations. This
paper proposes an adaptive MLaaS composition framework to ensure a seamless,
efficient, and scalable MLaaS composition. The framework integrates a service
assessment model to identify underperforming MLaaS services and a candidate
selection model to filter optimal replacements. An adaptive composition
mechanism is developed that incrementally updates MLaaS compositions using a
contextual multi-armed bandit optimization strategy. By continuously adapting
to evolving IoT constraints, the approach maintains Quality of Service (QoS)
while reducing the computational cost associated with recomposition from
scratch. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the
efficiency of our proposed approach.

Result: 成功构建了PolyMicros模型，并通过零样本学习解决了3D实验显微镜加速中的长期挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in Foundation Models for Materials Science are poised to
revolutionize the discovery, manufacture, and design of novel materials with
tailored properties and responses. Although great strides have been made,
successes have been restricted to materials classes where multi-million sample
data repositories can be readily curated (e.g., atomistic structures).
Unfortunately, for many structural and functional materials (e.g., mesoscale
structured metal alloys), such datasets are too costly or prohibitive to
construct; instead, datasets are limited to very few examples. To address this
challenge, we introduce a novel machine learning approach for learning from
hyper-sparse, complex spatial data in scientific domains. Our core contribution
is a physics-driven data augmentation scheme that leverages an ensemble of
local generative models, trained on as few as five experimental observations,
and coordinates them through a novel diversity curation strategy to generate a
large-scale, physically diverse dataset. We utilize this framework to construct
PolyMicros, the first Foundation Model for polycrystalline materials (a
structural material class important across a broad range of industrial and
scientific applications). We demonstrate the utility of PolyMicros by zero-shot
solving several long standing challenges related to accelerating 3D
experimental microscopy. Finally, we make both our models and datasets openly
available to the community.

Conclusion: 该方法为逆问题优化提供了可解释的解释，有助于领域专家理解优化过程。

Abstract: Inverse problems are central to a wide range of fields, including healthcare,
climate science, and agriculture. They involve the estimation of inputs,
typically via iterative optimization, to some known forward model so that it
produces a desired outcome. Despite considerable development in the
explainability and interpretability of forward models, the iterative
optimization of inverse problems remains largely cryptic to domain experts. We
propose a methodology to produce explanations, from traces produced by an
optimizer, that are interpretable by humans at the abstraction of the domain.
The central idea in our approach is to instrument a differentiable simulator so
that it emits natural language events during its forward and backward passes.
In a post-process, we use a Language Model to create an explanation from the
list of events. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an
illustrative optimization problem and an example involving the training of a
neural network.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, central to operation research and
theoretical computer science, present significant computational challenges due
to their NP-hard nature. While large language models (LLMs) have emerged as
promising tools for CO--either by directly generating solutions or synthesizing
solver-specific codes--existing approaches often neglect critical structural
priors inherent to CO problems, leading to suboptimality and iterative
inefficiency. Inspired by human experts' success in leveraging CO structures
for algorithm design, we propose STRCMP, a novel structure-aware LLM-based
algorithm discovery framework that systematically integrates structure priors
to enhance solution quality and solving efficiency. Our framework combines a
graph neural network (GNN) for extracting structural embeddings from CO
instances with an LLM conditioned on these embeddings to identify
high-performing algorithms in the form of solver-specific codes. This composite
architecture ensures syntactic correctness, preserves problem topology, and
aligns with natural language objectives, while an evolutionary refinement
process iteratively optimizes generated algorithm. Extensive evaluations across
Mixed Integer Linear Programming and Boolean Satisfiability problems, using
nine benchmark datasets, demonstrate that our proposed STRCMP outperforms five
strong neural and LLM-based methods by a large margin, in terms of both
solution optimality and computational efficiency. The code and learned model
will be publicly available upon the acceptance of the paper.

Result: 在AIME2024和GQA任务上，ADAMIX分别以22.3%和6.1%的优势超越最佳基线Delta-CoMe。

Conclusion: ADAMIX通过自适应混合精度策略，显著提升了delta压缩的性能和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance on various
knowledge-intensive and complex reasoning tasks in different domains. In
certain scenarios like multi-tenant serving, a large number of LLMs finetuned
from the same base model are deployed to meet complex requirements for users.
Recent works explore delta-compression approaches to quantize and compress the
delta parameters between the customized LLM and the corresponding base model.
However, existing works either exhibit unsatisfactory performance at high
compression ratios or depend on empirical bit allocation schemes. In this work,
we propose ADAMIX, an effective adaptive mixed-precision delta-compression
framework. We provide a mathematical derivation of quantization error to
motivate our mixed-precision compression strategy and formulate the optimal
mixed-precision bit allocation scheme as the solution to a 0/1 integer linear
programming problem. Our derived bit allocation strategy minimizes the
quantization error while adhering to a predefined compression ratio
requirement. Experimental results on various models and benchmarks demonstrate
that our approach surpasses the best baseline by a considerable margin. On
tasks like AIME2024 and GQA, where the norm of $\Delta \mathbf{W}$ is large and
the base model lacks sufficient ability, ADAMIX outperforms the best baseline
Delta-CoMe by 22.3% and 6.1% with 7B models, respectively.

Result: PFP成功减少在线学习中的特征偏见，在LLM对齐标准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PFP通过保留和利用偏好特征分布，有效提升LLM偏好学习的性能和公平性。

Abstract: Recent preference learning frameworks for large language models (LLMs)
simplify human preferences with binary pairwise comparisons and scalar rewards.
This simplification could make LLMs' responses biased to mostly preferred
features, and would be exacerbated during the iterations of online preference
learning steps. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework
coined PFP (Preference Feature Preservation). The key idea of PFP is
maintaining the distribution of human preference features and utilizing such
rich signals throughout the online preference learning process. Specifically,
PFP first extract preference features from offline pairwise human preference
data and trains a feature classifier. Then, using trained classifier and the
distribution preserving optimization, PFP maps appropriate preference features
for a new input instruction during online learning. Lastly, PFP trains LLM
using the existing preference learning method, by incorporating the preference
feature into system prompts and enabling LLM to explicitly handle various human
preferences. Our experiments demonstrate that PFP successfully mitigates the
bias in preference features during online learning, and hence achieves superior
performance compared to previous preference learning methods on standard
benchmarks to evaluate LLM alignment.

Conclusion: SectorE通过极坐标嵌入有效解决了语义层次结构建模问题，为知识图谱补全提供了新思路。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs), structured as multi-relational data of entities and
relations, are vital for tasks like data analysis and recommendation systems.
Knowledge graph completion (KGC), or link prediction, addresses incompleteness
of KGs by inferring missing triples (h, r, t). It is vital for downstream
applications. Region-based embedding models usually embed entities as points
and relations as geometric regions to accomplish the task. Despite progress,
these models often overlook semantic hierarchies inherent in entities. To solve
this problem, we propose SectorE, a novel embedding model in polar coordinates.
Relations are modeled as annular sectors, combining modulus and phase to
capture inference patterns and relation attributes. Entities are embedded as
points within these sectors, intuitively encoding hierarchical structure.
Evaluated on FB15k-237, WN18RR, and YAGO3-10, SectorE achieves competitive
performance against various kinds of models, demonstrating strengths in
semantic modeling capability.

Abstract: Structure determination workloads in neutron diffractometry are
computationally expensive and routinely require several hours to many days to
determine the structure of a material from its neutron diffraction patterns.
The potential for machine learning models trained on simulated neutron
scattering patterns to significantly speed up these tasks have been reported
recently. However, the amount of simulated data needed to train these models
grows exponentially with the number of structural parameters to be predicted
and poses a significant computational challenge. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce a novel batch-mode active learning (AL) policy that uses uncertainty
sampling to simulate training data drawn from a probability distribution that
prefers labelled examples about which the model is least certain. We confirm
its efficacy in training the same models with about 75% less training data
while improving the accuracy. We then discuss the design of an efficient
stream-based training workflow that uses this AL policy and present a
performance study on two heterogeneous platforms to demonstrate that, compared
with a conventional training workflow, the streaming workflow delivers about
20% shorter training time without any loss of accuracy.

events. Effectively segmenting and integrating states across these different
granularities is crucial for tasks like predictive maintenance and performance
optimization. However, existing time series segmentation methods face two key
challenges: (1) the inability to handle multiple levels of granularity within a
unified model, and (2) limited adaptability to new, evolving patterns in
dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose PromptTSS, a
novel framework for time series segmentation with multi-granularity states.
PromptTSS uses a unified model with a prompting mechanism that leverages label
and boundary information to guide segmentation, capturing both coarse- and
fine-grained patterns while adapting dynamically to unseen patterns.
Experiments show PromptTSS improves accuracy by 24.49% in multi-granularity
segmentation, 17.88% in single-granularity segmentation, and up to 599.24% in
transfer learning, demonstrating its adaptability to hierarchical states and
evolving time series dynamics.

*Xue Zhou,Dapeng Man,Chen Xu,Fanyi Zeng,Tao Liu,Huan Wang,Shucheng He,Chaoyang Gao,Wu Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对离线强化学习的数据覆盖攻击方法（CSDPC），通过毒化关键决策模式显著降低性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视数据覆盖不足的安全风险，且单步分析不符合离线RL的多步决策特性。

Method: 引入序列级可集中系数量化覆盖，提出CSDPC攻击，毒化稀有决策模式以减少覆盖。

Result: 实验显示毒化1%数据可使性能下降90%。

Conclusion: 研究为离线RL的安全分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) heavily relies on the coverage of
pre-collected data over the target policy's distribution. Existing studies aim
to improve data-policy coverage to mitigate distributional shifts, but overlook
security risks from insufficient coverage, and the single-step analysis is not
consistent with the multi-step decision-making nature of offline RL. To address
this, we introduce the sequence-level concentrability coefficient to quantify
coverage, and reveal its exponential amplification on the upper bound of
estimation errors through theoretical analysis. Building on this, we propose
the Collapsing Sequence-Level Data-Policy Coverage (CSDPC) poisoning attack.
Considering the continuous nature of offline RL data, we convert state-action
pairs into decision units, and extract representative decision patterns that
capture multi-step behavior. We identify rare patterns likely to cause
insufficient coverage, and poison them to reduce coverage and exacerbate
distributional shifts. Experiments show that poisoning just 1% of the dataset
can degrade agent performance by 90%. This finding provides new perspectives
for analyzing and safeguarding the security of offline RL.

Result: 决策树算法预测准确率最高（99.99%），有效分类水合物形成。

Conclusion: 该方法为优化生产效率提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Oil and gas reserves are vital resources for the global economy, serving as
key components in transportation, energy production, and industrial processes.
However, oil and gas extraction and production operations may encounter several
challenges, such as pipeline and production line blockages, caused by factors
including sediment accumulation, wax deposition, mineral scaling, and
corrosion. This study addresses these challenges by employing supervised
machine learning techniques, specifically decision trees, the k-Nearest
Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm (k-NN), and the Naive Bayes classifier method, to
detect and mitigate flow assurance challenges, ensuring efficient fluid
transport. The primary focus is on preventing gas hydrate formation in oil
production systems. To achieve this, data preprocessing and cleaning were
conducted to ensure the quality and consistency of the dataset, which was
sourced from Petrobras publicly available 3W project repository on GitHub. The
scikit-learn Python library, a widely recognized open-source tool for
supervised machine learning techniques, was utilized for classification tasks
due to its robustness and versatility. The results demonstrate that the
proposed methodology effectively classifies hydrate formation under operational
conditions, with the decision tree algorithm exhibiting the highest predictive
accuracy (99.99 percent). Consequently, this approach provides a reliable
solution for optimizing production efficiency.

Abstract: Introduction: Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs) are common cardiac
arrhythmias originating from the ventricles. Accurate detection remains

differences in lead placement, recording conditions, and population
demographics. Methods: We developed uPVC-Net, a universal deep learning model
to detect PVCs from any single-lead ECG recordings. The model is developed on
four independent ECG datasets comprising a total of 8.3 million beats collected
from Holter monitors and a modern wearable ECG patch. uPVC-Net employs a custom
architecture and a multi-source, multi-lead training strategy. For each
experiment, one dataset is held out to evaluate out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization. Results: uPVC-Net achieved an AUC between 97.8% and 99.1% on
the held-out datasets. Notably, performance on wearable single-lead ECG data
reached an AUC of 99.1%. Conclusion: uPVC-Net exhibits strong generalization
across diverse lead configurations and populations, highlighting its potential
for robust, real-world clinical deployment.

Result: 分析了公平性指标的组成部分及其与效益公平性的关系，并提出了一种平衡多种公平性概念的方法。

Conclusion: 本文为动态决策系统中的长期公平性研究提供了新视角，并提出了一种简单有效的平衡方法。

Abstract: Fairness-aware learning studies the development of algorithms that avoid
discriminatory decision outcomes despite biased training data. While most
studies have concentrated on immediate bias in static contexts, this paper
highlights the importance of investigating long-term fairness in dynamic
decision-making systems while simultaneously considering instantaneous fairness
requirements. In the context of reinforcement learning, we propose a general
framework where long-term fairness is measured by the difference in the average
expected qualification gain that individuals from different groups could
obtain.Then, through a causal lens, we decompose this metric into three
components that represent the direct impact, the delayed impact, as well as the
spurious effect the policy has on the qualification gain. We analyze the
intrinsic connection between these components and an emerging fairness notion
called benefit fairness that aims to control the equity of outcomes in
decision-making. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective approach for
balancing various fairness notions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文评估了时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）在建筑能源管理（BEM）中的通用性，发现其表现有限，尤其在零样本预测、协变量处理和复杂环境适应性方面不如传统统计模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BEM解决方案依赖特定任务和数据的模型，限制了广泛适用性。TSFMs若能像大语言模型（LLMs）一样通用，可能解决BEM的可扩展性问题。

Method: 通过四个维度评估TSFMs：零样本单变量预测、协变量预测、零样本表示学习分类任务，以及对性能指标和操作条件的鲁棒性。

Result: TSFMs在零样本预测和协变量处理中表现不佳，分类任务中表现较好，但对复杂环境和评估指标敏感。

Conclusion: TSFMs需改进协变量处理、上下文整合和时间动态预测机制，以实现更适应和可扩展的BEM解决方案。

Abstract: Building energy management (BEM) tasks require processing and learning from a
variety of time-series data. Existing solutions rely on bespoke task- and
data-specific models to perform these tasks, limiting their broader
applicability. Inspired by the transformative success of Large Language Models
(LLMs), Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), trained on diverse datasets,
have the potential to change this. Were TSFMs to achieve a level of
generalizability across tasks and contexts akin to LLMs, they could
fundamentally address the scalability challenges pervasive in BEM. To
understand where they stand today, we evaluate TSFMs across four dimensions:
(1) generalizability in zero-shot univariate forecasting, (2) forecasting with
covariates for thermal behavior modeling, (3) zero-shot representation learning
for classification tasks, and (4) robustness to performance metrics and varying
operational conditions. Our results reveal that TSFMs exhibit \emph{limited}
generalizability, performing only marginally better than statistical models on
unseen datasets and modalities for univariate forecasting. Similarly, inclusion
of covariates in TSFMs does not yield performance improvements, and their
performance remains inferior to conventional models that utilize covariates.
While TSFMs generate effective zero-shot representations for downstream
classification tasks, they may remain inferior to statistical models in
forecasting when statistical models perform test-time fitting. Moreover, TSFMs
forecasting performance is sensitive to evaluation metrics, and they struggle
in more complex building environments compared to statistical models. These
findings underscore the need for targeted advancements in TSFM design,
particularly their handling of covariates and incorporating context and
temporal dynamics into prediction mechanisms, to develop more adaptable and
scalable solutions for BEM.

Abstract: Growing concerns over privacy, security, and legal barriers are driving the
rising demand for synthetic data across domains such as healthcare, finance,
and energy. While generative models offer a promising solution to overcome
these barriers, their utility depends on the incorporation of domain-specific
knowledge. We propose to synthesize data using a guided diffusion model that
integrates domain constraints directly into the generative process. We develop
the model in the context of power systems, with potential applicability to
other domains that involve tabular data. Specifically, we synthesize
statistically representative and high-fidelity power flow datasets. To satisfy
domain constraints, e.g., Kirchhoff laws, we introduce a gradient-based
guidance to steer the sampling trajectory in a feasible direction. Numerical
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多样性提升的驱动下，F1分数提高了1-15%，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MOODS框架和新验证指标有效解决了类别不平衡问题，显著提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Two-class classification problems are often characterized by an imbalance
between the number of majority and minority datapoints resulting in poor
classification of the minority class in particular. Traditional approaches,
such as reweighting the loss function or na\"ive resampling, risk overfitting
and subsequently fail to improve classification because they do not consider
the diversity between majority and minority datasets. Such consideration is
infeasible because there is no metric that can measure the impact of imbalance
on the model. To obviate these challenges, we make two key contributions.
First, we introduce MOODS~(Multi-Objective Optimization for Data Sampling), a
novel multi-objective bilevel optimization framework that guides both synthetic
oversampling and majority undersampling. Second, we introduce a validation
metric -- `$\epsilon/ \delta$ non-overlapping diversification metric' -- that
quantifies the goodness of a sampling method towards model performance. With
this metric we experimentally demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with
improvement in diversity driving a $1-15 \%$ increase in $F1$ scores.

Conclusion: ASNO在工程应用、物理发现和可解释机器学习方面具有潜力。

Abstract: In scientific machine learning (SciML), a key challenge is learning unknown,
evolving physical processes and making predictions across spatio-temporal
scales. For example, in real-world manufacturing problems like additive
manufacturing, users adjust known machine settings while unknown environmental
parameters simultaneously fluctuate. To make reliable predictions, it is
desired for a model to not only capture long-range spatio-temporal interactions
from data but also adapt to new and unknown environments; traditional machine
learning models excel at the first task but often lack physical
interpretability and struggle to generalize under varying environmental
conditions. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Attention-based
Spatio-Temporal Neural Operator (ASNO), a novel architecture that combines
separable attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal interactions and adapts
to unseen physical parameters. Inspired by the backward differentiation formula
(BDF), ASNO learns a transformer for temporal prediction and extrapolation and
an attention-based neural operator for handling varying external loads,
enhancing interpretability by isolating historical state contributions and
external forces, enabling the discovery of underlying physical laws and
generalizability to unseen physical environments. Empirical results on SciML
benchmarks demonstrate that ASNO outperforms over existing models, establishing
its potential for engineering applications, physics discovery, and
interpretable machine learning.

Conclusion: 本文方法在未知参数情况下优化了样本复杂度，并展示了样本与计算复杂度的分离。

Abstract: We study the sample complexity of stochastic convex optimization when problem
parameters, e.g., the distance to optimality, are unknown. We pursue two
strategies. First, we develop a reliable model selection method that avoids
overfitting the validation set. This method allows us to generically tune the
learning rate of stochastic optimization methods to match the optimal
known-parameter sample complexity up to $\log\log$ factors. Second, we develop
a regularization-based method that is specialized to the case that only the
distance to optimality is unknown. This method provides perfect adaptability to
unknown distance to optimality, demonstrating a separation between the sample
and computational complexity of parameter-free stochastic convex optimization.
Combining these two methods allows us to simultaneously adapt to multiple
problem structures.
  Experiments performing few-shot learning on CIFAR-10 by fine-tuning CLIP
models and prompt engineering Gemini to count shapes indicate that our reliable
model selection method can help mitigate overfitting to small validation sets.

Result: 实验证明该方法显著提升组鲁棒性，适用于多种架构和数据模态。

Conclusion: Evidential Alignment提供了一种可扩展且无需标注的虚假相关性解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often learn and rely on spurious correlations, i.e.,
superficial associations between non-causal features and the targets. For
instance, an image classifier may identify camels based on the desert
backgrounds. While it can yield high overall accuracy during training, it
degrades generalization on more diverse scenarios where such correlations do
not hold. This problem poses significant challenges for out-of-distribution
robustness and trustworthiness. Existing methods typically mitigate this issue
by using external group annotations or auxiliary deterministic models to learn
unbiased representations. However, such information is costly to obtain, and
deterministic models may fail to capture the full spectrum of biases learned by
the models. To address these limitations, we propose Evidential Alignment, a
novel framework that leverages uncertainty quantification to understand the
behavior of the biased models without requiring group annotations. By
quantifying the evidence of model prediction with second-order risk
minimization and calibrating the biased models with the proposed evidential
calibration technique, Evidential Alignment identifies and suppresses spurious
correlations while preserving core features. We theoretically justify the
effectiveness of our method as capable of learning the patterns of biased
models and debiasing the model without requiring any spurious correlation
annotations. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly
improves group robustness across diverse architectures and data modalities,
providing a scalable and principled solution to spurious correlations.

Conclusion: 本文不仅恢复了现有核回归边界，还展示了神经网络的特征学习能力，优于传统核方法。

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization methods have shown remarkable empirical success,
yet their theoretical generalization properties remain only partially
understood. In this paper, we establish a generalization bound for gradient
flow that aligns with the classical Rademacher complexity bounds for kernel
methods-specifically those based on the RKHS norm and kernel trace-through a
data-dependent kernel called the loss path kernel (LPK). Unlike static kernels
such as NTK, the LPK captures the entire training trajectory, adapting to both
data and optimization dynamics, leading to tighter and more informative
generalization guarantees. Moreover, the bound highlights how the norm of the
training loss gradients along the optimization trajectory influences the final
generalization performance. The key technical ingredients in our proof combine
stability analysis of gradient flow with uniform convergence via Rademacher
complexity. Our bound recovers existing kernel regression bounds for
overparameterized neural networks and shows the feature learning capability of
neural networks compared to kernel methods. Numerical experiments on real-world
datasets validate that our bounds correlate well with the true generalization
gap.

Method: 研究了三种EDN变体，分析了节点标签噪声概率与节点度数的关系，并在多个图数据集上进行了实验，使用了5种GNN架构和8种噪声鲁棒算法。

Result: 实验结果显示，EDN的两种变体对GNN和噪声鲁棒算法的性能退化影响显著大于传统模型，并通过统计假设检验验证了这一结论。

Conclusion: EDN模型的引入对评估图数据噪声鲁棒算法至关重要，有助于提升噪声环境下基于图的学习的可靠性。

Abstract: An important structural feature of a graph is its set of edges, as it
captures the relationships among the nodes (the graph's topology). Existing
node label noise models like Symmetric Label Noise (SLN) and Class Conditional
Noise (CCN) disregard this important node relationship in graph data; and the
Edge-Dependent Noise (EDN) model addresses this limitation. EDN posits that in
real-world scenarios, label noise may be influenced by the connections between
nodes. We explore three variants of EDN. A crucial notion that relates nodes
and edges in a graph is the degree of a node; we show that in all three
variants, the probability of a node's label corruption is dependent on its
degree. Additionally, we compare the dependence of these probabilities on node
degree across different variants. We performed experiments on popular graph
datasets using 5 different GNN architectures and 8 noise robust algorithms for
graph data. The results demonstrate that 2 variants of EDN lead to greater
performance degradation in both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and existing
noise-robust algorithms, as compared to traditional node label noise models. We
statistically verify this by posing a suitable hypothesis-testing problem. This
emphasizes the importance of incorporating EDN when evaluating noise robust
algorithms for graphs, to enhance the reliability of graph-based learning in
noisy environments.

Conclusion: 随机性对性能的影响取决于分数误差结构，需根据具体情况选择随机性参数。

Abstract: Sampling in score-based diffusion models can be performed by solving either a
probability flow ODE or a reverse-time stochastic differential equation (SDE)
parameterized by an arbitrary stochasticity parameter. In this work, we study
the effect of stochasticity on the generation process through bounds on the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and complement the analysis with numerical and
analytical examples. Our results apply to general forward SDEs with additive
noise and Lipschitz-continuous score functions, and quantify how errors from
the prior distribution and score approximation propagate under different
choices of the stochasticity parameter. The theoretical bounds are derived
using log-Sobolev inequalities for the marginals of the forward process, which
enable a more effective control of the KL divergence decay along sampling. For
exact score functions, we find that stochasticity acts as an error-correcting
mechanism, decreasing KL divergence along the sampling trajectory. For an
approximate score function, there is a trade-off between error correction and
score error amplification, so that stochasticity can either improve or worsen
the performance, depending on the structure of the score error. Numerical
experiments on simple datasets and a fully analytical example are included to
illustrate and enlighten the theoretical results.

Abstract: This work presents a novel graph neural network (GNN) architecture, the
Feature-specific Interpretable Graph Neural Network (FIGNN), designed to
enhance the interpretability of deep learning surrogate models defined on
unstructured grids in scientific applications. Traditional GNNs often obscure
the distinct spatial influences of different features in multivariate
prediction tasks. FIGNN addresses this limitation by introducing a
feature-specific pooling strategy, which enables independent attribution of
spatial importance for each predicted variable. Additionally, a mask-based
regularization term is incorporated into the training objective to explicitly
encourage alignment between interpretability and predictive error, promoting
localized attribution of model performance. The method is evaluated for
surrogate modeling of two physically distinct systems: the SPEEDY atmospheric
circulation model and the backward-facing step (BFS) fluid dynamics benchmark.
Results demonstrate that FIGNN achieves competitive predictive performance
while revealing physically meaningful spatial patterns unique to each feature.
Analysis of rollout stability, feature-wise error budgets, and spatial mask
overlays confirm the utility of FIGNN as a general-purpose framework for
interpretable surrogate modeling in complex physical domains.

TL;DR: PEFT方法（如LoRA）在高效微调预训练大模型时，可能因依赖虚假标记（SSTI）导致模型决策被操控。研究发现，少量标记即可影响模型行为，且LoRA秩与其对虚假标记的依赖程度相关。

Motivation: 研究PEFT方法在高效微调中的潜在失败模式，特别是虚假标记对模型决策的影响。

Method: 通过Seamless Spurious Token Injection (SSTI)技术，在不同模型和数据集上测试PEFT对虚假标记的依赖。

Result: 发现少量虚假标记即可操控模型行为，且LoRA秩与依赖程度相关；高秩LoRA在强SSTI下更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PEFT方法需警惕虚假标记的潜在风险，高秩LoRA在特定情况下可能提升模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Parameter Efficient FineTuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA),
aligns pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to particular downstream tasks
in a resource-efficient manner. Because efficiency has been the main metric of
progress, very little attention has been put in understanding possible
catastrophic failures. We uncover one such failure: PEFT encourages a model to
search for shortcut solutions to solve its fine-tuning tasks. When very small
amount of tokens, e.g., one token per prompt, are correlated with downstream
task classes, PEFT makes any pretrained model rely predominantly on that token
for decision making. While such spurious tokens may emerge accidentally from
incorrect data cleaning, it also opens opportunities for malevolent parties to
control a model's behavior from Seamless Spurious Token Injection (SSTI). In
SSTI, a small amount of tokens correlated with downstream classes are injected
by the dataset creators. At test time, the finetuned LLM's behavior can be
controlled solely by injecting those few tokens. We apply SSTI across models
from three families (Snowflake Arctic, Apple OpenELM, and Meta LLaMA-3) and
four diverse datasets (IMDB, Financial Classification, CommonSense QA, and Bias
in Bios). Our findings reveal three astonishing behaviors. First, as few as a
single token of SSTI is sufficient to steer a model's decision making. Second,
for light SSTI, the reliance on spurious tokens is proportional to the LoRA
rank. Lastly, with aggressive SSTI, larger LoRA rank values become preferable
to small rank values as it makes the model attend to non-spurious tokens, hence
improving robustness.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的联邦学习威胁模型——恶意好奇客户端，通过操纵梯度以推断其他客户端的私有数据，揭示了现有防御措施的盲点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习协议存在隐私泄露风险，尤其是服务器通过梯度合成客户端训练数据。本文旨在探索客户端侧的新型威胁模型及其影响。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了联邦学习防御中的关键盲点，呼吁重新审视现有防御机制的有效性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized machine learning without
sharing raw data, allowing multiple clients to collaboratively learn a global
model. However, studies reveal that privacy leakage is possible under commonly
adopted FL protocols. In particular, a server with access to client gradients
can synthesize data resembling the clients' training data. In this paper, we
introduce a novel threat model in FL, named the maliciously curious client,
where a client manipulates its own gradients with the goal of inferring private
data from peers. This attacker uniquely exploits the strength of a Byzantine
adversary, traditionally aimed at undermining model robustness, and repurposes
it to facilitate data reconstruction attack. We begin by formally defining this
novel client-side threat model and providing a theoretical analysis that
demonstrates its ability to achieve significant reconstruction success during
FL training. To demonstrate its practical impact, we further develop a
reconstruction algorithm that combines gradient inversion with malicious update
strategies. Our analysis and experimental results reveal a critical blind spot
in FL defenses: both server-side robust aggregation and client-side privacy
mechanisms may fail against our proposed attack. Surprisingly, standard server-
and client-side defenses designed to enhance robustness or privacy may
unintentionally amplify data leakage. Compared to the baseline approach, a
mistakenly used defense may instead improve the reconstructed image quality by
10-15%.

Abstract: In Large Language Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can
significantly enhance the performance of large language models by integrating
external knowledge. However, RAG also introduces new security risks. Existing
research focuses mainly on how poisoning attacks in RAG systems affect model
output quality, overlooking their potential to amplify model biases. For
example, when querying about domestic violence victims, a compromised RAG
system might preferentially retrieve documents depicting women as victims,
causing the model to generate outputs that perpetuate gender stereotypes even
when the original query is gender neutral. To show the impact of the bias, this
paper proposes a Bias Retrieval and Reward Attack (BRRA) framework, which
systematically investigates attack pathways that amplify language model biases
through a RAG system manipulation. We design an adversarial document generation
method based on multi-objective reward functions, employ subspace projection
techniques to manipulate retrieval results, and construct a cyclic feedback
mechanism for continuous bias amplification. Experiments on multiple mainstream
large language models demonstrate that BRRA attacks can significantly enhance
model biases in dimensions. In addition, we explore a dual stage defense
mechanism to effectively mitigate the impacts of the attack. This study reveals
that poisoning attacks in RAG systems directly amplify model output biases and
clarifies the relationship between RAG system security and model fairness. This
novel potential attack indicates that we need to keep an eye on the fairness
issues of the RAG system.

Motivation: 设计高亲和力蛋白质结合蛋白是生物医学和生物技术的关键需求，但目前仍缺乏无需大量实验即可实现的方法。

Conclusion: PPDiff为蛋白质结合蛋白设计提供了一种高效、无需大量实验的新方法。

Abstract: Designing protein-binding proteins with high affinity is critical in
biomedical research and biotechnology. Despite recent advancements targeting
specific proteins, the ability to create high-affinity binders for arbitrary
protein targets on demand, without extensive rounds of wet-lab testing, remains
a significant challenge. Here, we introduce PPDiff, a diffusion model to
jointly design the sequence and structure of binders for arbitrary protein
targets in a non-autoregressive manner. PPDiffbuilds upon our developed
Sequence Structure Interleaving Network with Causal attention layers (SSINC),
which integrates interleaved self-attention layers to capture global amino acid
correlations, k-nearest neighbor (kNN) equivariant graph layers to model local
interactions in three-dimensional (3D) space, and causal attention layers to
simplify the intricate interdependencies within the protein sequence. To assess
PPDiff, we curate PPBench, a general protein-protein complex dataset comprising
706,360 complexes from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The model is pretrained on
PPBenchand finetuned on two real-world applications: target-protein mini-binder
complex design and antigen-antibody complex design. PPDiffconsistently
surpasses baseline methods, achieving success rates of 50.00%, 23.16%, and
16.89% for the pretraining task and the two downstream applications,
respectively.

Conclusion: TruncQuant为深度神经网络在边缘设备上的高效部署提供了一种灵活且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks on edge devices is a challenging task
due to the increasing complexity of state-of-the-art models, requiring efforts
to reduce model size and inference latency. Recent studies explore models
operating at diverse quantization settings to find the optimal point that
balances computational efficiency and accuracy. Truncation, an effective
approach for achieving lower bit precision mapping, enables a single model to
adapt to various hardware platforms with little to no cost. However,
formulating a training scheme for deep neural networks to withstand the
associated errors introduced by truncation remains a challenge, as the current
quantization-aware training schemes are not designed for the truncation
process. We propose TruncQuant, a novel truncation-ready training scheme
allowing flexible bit precision through bit-shifting in runtime. We achieve
this by aligning TruncQuant with the output of the truncation process,
demonstrating strong robustness across bit-width settings, and offering an
easily implementable training scheme within existing quantization-aware
frameworks. Our code is released at https://github.com/a2jinhee/TruncQuant.

Result: 在ViTs中，90%稀疏线性层实现了3.13倍在线推理加速和1.59倍训练加速，且性能无损。

Conclusion: DynaDiag在保持性能的同时，显著提升了计算效率，适用于现代硬件。

Abstract: Recent advances in Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) have pushed the frontier of
sparse neural network training in structured and unstructured contexts,
matching dense-model performance while drastically reducing parameter counts to
facilitate model scaling. However, unstructured sparsity often fails to
translate into practical speedups on modern hardware. To address this
shortcoming, we propose DynaDiag, a novel structured sparse-to-sparse DST
method that performs at par with unstructured sparsity. DynaDiag enforces a
diagonal sparsity pattern throughout training and preserves sparse computation
in forward and backward passes. We further leverage the diagonal structure to
accelerate computation via a custom CUDA kernel, rendering the method
hardware-friendly. Empirical evaluations on diverse neural architectures
demonstrate that our method maintains accuracy on par with unstructured
counterparts while benefiting from tangible computational gains. Notably, with
90% sparse linear layers in ViTs, we observe up to a 3.13x speedup in online
inference without sacrificing model performance and a 1.59x speedup in training
on a GPU compared to equivalent unstructured layers. Our source code is

Result: 实验验证RollingQ有效恢复了多模态Transformer的动态合作能力。

Conclusion: RollingQ方法简单有效，为广泛部署的多模态Transformer提供了更优的动态融合能力。

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces challenges in effectively fusing information from
diverse modalities, especially when modality quality varies across samples.
Dynamic fusion strategies, such as attention mechanism in Transformers, aim to
address such challenge by adaptively emphasizing modalities based on the
characteristics of input data. However, through amounts of carefully designed
experiments, we surprisingly observed that the dynamic adaptability of
widely-used self-attention models diminishes. Model tends to prefer one
modality regardless of data characteristics. This bias triggers a
self-reinforcing cycle that progressively overemphasizes the favored modality,
widening the distribution gap in attention keys across modalities and
deactivating attention mechanism's dynamic properties. To revive adaptability,
we propose a simple yet effective method Rolling Query (RollingQ), which
balances attention allocation by rotating the query to break the
self-reinforcing cycle and mitigate the key distribution gap. Extensive
experiments on various multimodal scenarios validate the effectiveness of
RollingQ and the restoration of cooperation dynamics is pivotal for enhancing
the broader capabilities of widely deployed multimodal Transformers. The source
code is available at https://github.com/GeWu-Lab/RollingQ_ICML2025.

Conclusion: LearnAlign为数据高效的强化学习后训练提供了新思路，并为未来推理数据优化研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing LLMs'
reasoning abilities, yet its data inefficiency remains a major bottleneck. To
address this critical yet challenging issue, we present a novel
gradient-alignment-based method, named LearnAlign, which intelligently selects
the learnable and representative training reasoning data for RL post-training.
To overcome the well-known issue of response-length bias in gradient norms, we
introduce the data learnability based on the success rate, which can indicate
the learning potential of each data point. Experiments across three
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
reduces training data requirements while achieving minor performance
degradation or even improving performance compared to full-data training. For
example, it reduces data requirements by up to 1,000 data points with better
performance (77.53%) than that on the full dataset on GSM8K benchmark (77.04%).
Furthermore, we show its effectiveness in the staged RL setting. This work
provides valuable insights into data-efficient RL post-training and establishes
a foundation for future research in optimizing reasoning data selection.To

Abstract: Diabetes has emerged as a significant global health issue, especially with
the increasing number of cases in many countries. This trend Underlines the
need for a greater emphasis on early detection and proactive management to

Abstract: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is traditionally assessed using subjective
grading systems, which introduces variability in diagnosis. This study
investigates the use of machine learning to improve diagnostic consistency by
analyzing voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) images. A total of 113 VCUG images
were reviewed, with expert grading of VUR severity. Nine image-based features
were selected to train six predictive models: Logistic Regression, Decision
Tree, Gradient Boosting, Neural Network, and Stochastic Gradient Descent. The
models were evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation. Analysis identified
deformation patterns in the renal calyces as key indicators of high-grade VUR.
All models achieved accurate classifications with no false positives or
negatives. High sensitivity to subtle image patterns characteristic of
different VUR grades was confirmed by substantial Area Under the Curve (AUC)
values. The results suggest that machine learning can offer an objective and
standardized alternative to current subjective VUR assessments. These findings
highlight renal calyceal deformation as a strong predictor of severe cases.
Future research should aim to expand the dataset, refine imaging features, and
improve model generalizability for broader clinical use.

Abstract: In recent years, deep discrete representation learning (DRL) has achieved
significant success across various domains. Most DRL frameworks (e.g., the
widely used VQ-VAE and its variants) have primarily focused on generative
settings, where the quality of a representation is implicitly gauged by the
fidelity of its generation. In fact, the goodness of a discrete representation
remain ambiguously defined across the literature. In this work, we adopt a
practical approach that examines DRL from a task-driven perspective. We propose
a unified framework that explores the usefulness of discrete features in
relation to downstream tasks, with generation naturally viewed as one possible
application. In this context, the properties of discrete representations as
well as the way they benefit certain tasks are also relatively understudied. We
therefore provide an additional theoretical analysis of the trade-off between
representational capacity and sample complexity, shedding light on how discrete
representation utilization impacts task performance. Finally, we demonstrate
the flexibility and effectiveness of our framework across diverse applications.

Conclusion: 建议采用对齐导向的方法选择适当的范式，并展望了相关研究方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled unprecedented
capabilities for time-series reasoning in diverse real-world applications,
including medical, financial, and spatio-temporal domains. However, existing
approaches typically focus on task-specific model customization, such as
forecasting and anomaly detection, while overlooking the data itself, referred
to as time-series primitives, which are essential for in-depth reasoning. This
position paper advocates a fundamental shift in approaching time-series
reasoning with LLMs: prioritizing alignment paradigms grounded in the intrinsic
primitives of time series data over task-specific model customization. This
realignment addresses the core limitations of current time-series reasoning
approaches, which are often costly, inflexible, and inefficient, by
systematically accounting for intrinsic structure of data before task
engineering. To this end, we propose three alignment paradigms: Injective
Alignment, Bridging Alignment, and Internal Alignment, which are emphasized by
prioritizing different aspects of time-series primitives: domain,
characteristic, and representation, respectively, to activate time-series
reasoning capabilities of LLMs to enable economical, flexible, and efficient
reasoning. We further recommend that practitioners adopt an alignment-oriented
method to avail this instruction to select an appropriate alignment paradigm.
Additionally, we categorize relevant literature into these alignment paradigms
and outline promising research directions.

Conclusion: 该框架为未来提示工程和自动演示选择提供了理论依据，首次将推理时注意力形式化为蒸馏过程。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows large language models (LLMs) to solve novel
tasks without weight updates. Despite its empirical success, the mechanism
behind ICL remains poorly understood, limiting our ability to interpret,
improve, and reliably apply it. In this paper, we propose a new theoretical
perspective that interprets ICL as an implicit form of knowledge distillation
(KD), where prompt demonstrations guide the model to form a task-specific
reference model during inference. Under this view, we derive a Rademacher
complexity-based generalization bound and prove that the bias of the distilled
weights grows linearly with the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between the
prompt and target distributions. This theoretical framework explains several
empirical phenomena and unifies prior gradient-based and distributional
analyses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first to formalize
inference-time attention as a distillation process, which provides theoretical
insights for future prompt engineering and automated demonstration selection.

Conclusion: Delayformer是一种高效且广泛适用的时间序列预测框架。

Abstract: Predicting time-series is of great importance in various scientific and
engineering fields. However, in the context of limited and noisy data,
accurately predicting dynamics of all variables in a high-dimensional system is
a challenging task due to their nonlinearity and also complex interactions.
Current methods including deep learning approaches often perform poorly for
real-world systems under such circumstances. This study introduces the
Delayformer framework for simultaneously predicting dynamics of all variables,
by developing a novel multivariate spatiotemporal information (mvSTI)
transformation that makes each observed variable into a delay-embedded state
(vector) and further cross-learns those states from different variables. From
dynamical systems viewpoint, Delayformer predicts system states rather than
individual variables, thus theoretically and computationally overcoming such
nonlinearity and cross-interaction problems. Specifically, it first utilizes a
single shared Visual Transformer (ViT) encoder to cross-represent dynamical
states from observed variables in a delay embedded form and then employs
distinct linear decoders for predicting next states, i.e. equivalently
predicting all original variables parallelly. By leveraging the theoretical
foundations of delay embedding theory and the representational capabilities of
Transformers, Delayformer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in
forecasting tasks on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Furthermore, the
potential of Delayformer as a foundational time-series model is demonstrated
through cross-domain forecasting tasks, highlighting its broad applicability
across various scenarios.

Abstract: State estimation or filtering serves as a fundamental task to enable
intelligent decision-making in applications such as autonomous vehicles,
robotics, healthcare monitoring, smart grids, intelligent transportation, and
predictive maintenance. Standard filtering assumes prior knowledge of noise
statistics to extract latent system states from noisy sensor data. However,
real-world scenarios involve abnormalities like outliers, biases, drifts, and
missing observations with unknown or partially known statistics, limiting
conventional approaches. This thesis presents novel robust nonlinear filtering
methods to mitigate these challenges. Based on insights from our filtering
proposals, we extend the formulations to offline estimation/learning setups and
propose smoothing extensions. Our methods leverage Bayesian inference
frameworks, employing both deterministic and stochastic approximation
techniques including Variational Inference (VI) and Particle Filters/Sequential
Monte Carlo (SMC). We also study theoretical estimation limits using Bayesian
Cram\'er-Rao bounds (BCRBs) in the context of measurement abnormalities. To
validate the performance gains of the proposed methods, we perform simulations
and experiments in scenarios including target tracking, indoor localization, 3D
point cloud registration, mesh registration, and pose graph optimization. The
fundamental nature of the work makes it useful in diverse applications, with
possible future extensions toward developing outlier-robust machine learning

*Xiaoyu Ma,Hao Chen,Yongjian Deng*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多模态数据重混合方法，通过解耦数据、筛选难样本和批量重组，解决多模态学习中的不平衡和不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中存在优化轨迹差异，导致模态懒惰和冲突，现有方法无法同时实现单模态充分性和多模态平衡。

Method: 提出多模态数据重混合，包括解耦数据、筛选难样本和批量重组，以对齐梯度方向并避免跨模态干扰。

Result: 实验显示方法可无缝集成现有方法，在CREMAD和Kinetic-Sounds上分别提升6.50%和3.41%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多模态学习中的不平衡问题，提升了单模态学习的充分性，且无需额外计算开销。

Abstract: Different modalities hold considerable gaps in optimization trajectories,
including speeds and paths, which lead to modality laziness and modality clash
when jointly training multimodal models, resulting in insufficient and
imbalanced multimodal learning. Existing methods focus on enforcing the weak
modality by adding modality-specific optimization objectives, aligning their
optimization speeds, or decomposing multimodal learning to enhance unimodal
learning. These methods fail to achieve both unimodal sufficiency and
multimodal balance. In this paper, we, for the first time, address both
concerns by proposing multimodal Data Remixing, including decoupling multimodal
data and filtering hard samples for each modality to mitigate modality
imbalance; and then batch-level reassembling to align the gradient directions
and avoid cross-modal interference, thus enhancing unimodal learning
sufficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can be seamlessly
integrated with existing approaches, improving accuracy by approximately
6.50%$\uparrow$ on CREMAD and 3.41%$\uparrow$ on Kinetic-Sounds, without
training set expansion or additional computational overhead during inference.

Motivation: 现有基础模型在泛化与个性化之间存在矛盾，联邦基础模型通过去中心化过程解决这一问题。

Method: 利用联邦基础模型（FFM）在推荐系统中分离共享知识与个性化适配，设计保留用户个性的学习范式。

Result: 提出了一种用户中心、去中心化的架构，用户可控制个性化代理。

Conclusion: FFM在推荐系统中展示了平衡泛化与个性化的潜力，为未来个性化代理提供了方向。

Abstract: A core learning challenge for existed Foundation Models (FM) is striking the
tradeoff between generalization with personalization, which is a dilemma that
has been highlighted by various parameter-efficient adaptation techniques.
Federated foundation models (FFM) provide a structural means to decouple shared
knowledge from individual specific adaptations via decentralized processes.
Recommendation systems offer a perfect testbed for FFMs, given their reliance
on rich implicit feedback reflecting unique user characteristics. This position
paper discusses a novel learning paradigm where FFMs not only harness their
generalization capabilities but are specifically designed to preserve the
integrity of user personality, illustrated thoroughly within the recommendation
contexts. We envision future personal agents, powered by personalized adaptive
FMs, guiding user decisions on content. Such an architecture promises a user
centric, decentralized system where individuals maintain control over their
personalized agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高训练样本质量对提升ML模型的可靠性和性能至关重要，但目前缺乏对不同影响力信号在检测不同类型问题（如错误标签和异常样本）的实验评估。

Method: 通过实验评估多种影响力信号（如Self-Influence、Average Absolute Influence等）在不同数据模态（图像和表格）和深度学习模型中的表现。

Result: Self-Influence能有效检测错误标签样本，但现有信号无法检测异常样本，且部分信号存在影响力抵消效应。

Conclusion: 现有影响力信号在检测异常样本方面存在不足，需进一步考虑训练动态和影响力抵消效应。

Abstract: Improving the quality of training samples is crucial for improving the
reliability and performance of ML models. In this paper, we conduct a
comparative evaluation of influence-based signals for debugging training data.
These signals can potentially identify both mislabeled and anomalous samples
from a potentially noisy training set as we build the models and hence
alleviate the need for dedicated glitch detectors. Although several
influence-based signals (e.g., Self-Influence, Average Absolute Influence,
Marginal Influence, GD-class) have been recently proposed in the literature,
there are no experimental studies for assessing their power in detecting
different glitch types (e.g., mislabeled and anomalous samples) under a common
influence estimator (e.g., TraceIn) for different data modalities (image and
tabular), and deep learning models (trained from scratch or foundation).
Through extensive experiments, we show that signals like Self-Influence
effectively detect mislabeled samples, but none of the existing signals can
detect anomalies. Existing signals do not take into account the training
dynamics, i.e., how the samples' influence on the model changes during
training, while some signals fall into influence cancellation effects, i.e.,
influence score is zero due to unsigned scores accumulation, resulting in
misleading influence attribution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图核复杂度的边净化方法（KCES），用于提升图神经网络的鲁棒性，无需训练且模型无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络（GNNs）对微小扰动和对抗攻击高度脆弱，现有防御方法依赖启发式指标且计算复杂。

Method: 利用图核复杂度（GKC）定义边KC分数，剪枝高KC分数边以减轻对抗攻击影响。

Result: KCES显著提升GNN鲁棒性，优于现有方法，并可与其他防御策略无缝集成。

Conclusion: KCES为GNN提供了一种高效、理论支持的防御方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive success across a wide
range of graph-based tasks, yet they remain highly vulnerable to small,
imperceptible perturbations and adversarial attacks. Although numerous defense
methods have been proposed to address these vulnerabilities, many rely on
heuristic metrics, overfit to specific attack patterns, and suffer from high
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose Kernel Complexity-Based
Edge Sanitization (KCES), a training-free, model-agnostic defense framework.
KCES leverages Graph Kernel Complexity (GKC), a novel metric derived from the
graph's Gram matrix that characterizes GNN generalization via its test error
bound. Building on GKC, we define a KC score for each edge, measuring the
change in GKC when the edge is removed. Edges with high KC scores, typically
introduced by adversarial perturbations, are pruned to mitigate their harmful
effects, thereby enhancing GNNs' robustness. KCES can also be seamlessly
integrated with existing defense strategies as a plug-and-play module without
requiring training. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate
that KCES consistently enhances GNN robustness, outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, and amplifies the effectiveness of existing defenses, offering a
principled and efficient solution for securing GNNs.

Method: 使用新的狭窄不对齐数据集，改进模型生物，测试不同模型规模、家族和训练协议，并分析机制相变。

Result: 改进模型实现99%一致性（原67%），支持0.5B参数模型（原32B），并发现EM现象普遍存在。

Conclusion: EM现象表明当前对齐方法不足，研究为未来理解和缓解对齐风险提供了工具和基础。

Abstract: Recent work discovered Emergent Misalignment (EM): fine-tuning large language
models on narrowly harmful datasets can lead them to become broadly misaligned.
A survey of experts prior to publication revealed this was highly unexpected,
demonstrating critical gaps in our understanding of model alignment. In this
work, we both advance understanding and provide tools for future research.
Using new narrowly misaligned datasets, we create a set of improved model
organisms that achieve 99% coherence (vs. 67% prior), work with smaller 0.5B
parameter models (vs. 32B), and that induce misalignment using a single rank-1
LoRA adapter. We demonstrate that EM occurs robustly across diverse model
sizes, three model families, and numerous training protocols including full
supervised fine-tuning. Leveraging these cleaner model organisms, we isolate a
mechanistic phase transition and demonstrate that it corresponds to a robust
behavioural phase transition in all studied organisms. Aligning large language
models is critical for frontier AI safety, yet EM exposes how far we are from
achieving this robustly. By distilling clean model organisms that isolate a
minimal alignment-compromising change, and where this is learnt, we establish a
foundation for future research into understanding and mitigating alignment
risks in LLMs.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
domains, but their performance can be severely degraded by noisy or corrupted
training data. Conventional noise mitigation methods often rely on explicit
assumptions about noise distributions or require extensive retraining, which
can be impractical for large-scale models. Inspired by the principles of
machine unlearning, we propose a novel framework that integrates
attribution-guided data partitioning, discriminative neuron pruning, and
targeted fine-tuning to mitigate the impact of noisy samples. Our approach
employs gradient-based attribution to probabilistically distinguish
high-quality examples from potentially corrupted ones without imposing
restrictive assumptions on the noise. It then applies regression-based
sensitivity analysis to identify and prune neurons that are most vulnerable to
noise. Finally, the resulting network is fine-tuned on the high-quality data
subset to efficiently recover and enhance its generalization performance. This
integrated unlearning-inspired framework provides several advantages over
conventional noise-robust learning approaches. Notably, it combines data-level
unlearning with model-level adaptation, thereby avoiding the need for full
model retraining or explicit noise modeling. We evaluate our method on
representative tasks (e.g., CIFAR-10 image classification and speech
recognition) under various noise levels and observe substantial gains in both
accuracy and efficiency. For example, our framework achieves approximately a
10% absolute accuracy improvement over standard retraining on CIFAR-10 with
injected label noise, while reducing retraining time by up to 47% in some
settings. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the
proposed approach for achieving robust generalization in noisy environments.

Result: 发现不同不匹配模型会收敛到相似的不匹配表示，提取的“不匹配方向”可有效消除其他模型的不匹配行为。

Conclusion: 通过研究涌现性不匹配的机制，为更广泛理解和缓解模型不匹配提供了基础。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models on narrow datasets can cause them to
develop broadly misaligned behaviours: a phenomena known as emergent
misalignment. However, the mechanisms underlying this misalignment, and why it
generalizes beyond the training domain, are poorly understood, demonstrating
critical gaps in our knowledge of model alignment. In this work, we train and
study a minimal model organism which uses just 9 rank-1 adapters to emergently
misalign Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Studying this, we find that different emergently
misaligned models converge to similar representations of misalignment. We
demonstrate this convergence by extracting a 'misalignment direction' from one
fine-tuned model's activations, and using it to effectively ablate misaligned
behaviour from fine-tunes using higher dimensional LoRAs and different
datasets. Leveraging the scalar hidden state of rank-1 LoRAs, we further
present a set of experiments for directly interpreting the fine-tuning
adapters, showing that six contribute to general misalignment, while two
specialise for misalignment in just the fine-tuning domain. Emergent
misalignment is a particularly salient example of undesirable and unexpected
model behaviour and by advancing our understanding of the mechanisms behind it,
we hope to move towards being able to better understand and mitigate
misalignment more generally.

Abstract: The relative balance between physics and data within any physics-informed
machine learner is an important modelling consideration to ensure that the
benefits of both physics and data-based approaches are maximised. An over
reliance on physical knowledge can be detrimental, particularly when the
physics-based component of a model may not accurately represent the true
underlying system. An underutilisation of physical knowledge potentially wastes
a valuable resource, along with benefits in model interpretability and reduced
demand for expensive data collection. Achieving an optimal physics-data balance
is a challenging aspect of model design, particularly if the level varies
through time; for example, one might have a physical approximation, only valid
within particular regimes, or a physical phenomenon may be known to only occur
when given conditions are met (e.g. at high temperatures). This paper develops
novel, physically-informed, change-point kernels for Gaussian processes,
capable of dynamically varying the reliance upon available physical knowledge.
A high level of control is granted to a user, allowing for the definition of
conditions in which they believe a phenomena should occur and the rate at which
the knowledge should be phased in and out of a model. In circumstances where
users may be less certain, the switching reliance upon physical knowledge may
be automatically learned and recovered from the model in an interpretable and
intuitive manner. Variation of the modelled noise based on the physical
phenomena occurring is also implemented to provide a more representative
capture of uncertainty alongside predictions. The capabilities of the new
kernel structures are explored through the use of two engineering case studies:
the directional wind loading of a cable-stayed bridge and the prediction of
aircraft wing strain during in-flight manoeuvring.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown significant success for graph-based
tasks. Motivated by the prevalence of large datasets in real-world
applications, pooling layers are crucial components of GNNs. By reducing the
size of input graphs, pooling enables faster training and potentially better
generalisation. However, existing pooling operations often optimise for the
learning task at the expense of fundamental graph structures and
interpretability. This leads to unreliable performance across varying dataset
types, downstream tasks and pooling ratios. Addressing these concerns, we
propose novel graph pooling layers for structure aware pooling via edge
collapses. Our methods leverage diffusion geometry and iteratively reduce a
graph's size while preserving both its metric structure and structural
diversity. We guide pooling using magnitude, an isometry-invariant diversity
measure, which permits us to control the fidelity of the pooling process.
Further, we use the spread of a metric space as a faster and more stable
alternative ensuring computational efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate
that our methods (i) achieve superior performance compared to alternative
pooling layers across a range of diverse graph classification tasks, (ii)
preserve key spectral properties of the input graphs, and (iii) retain high
accuracy across varying pooling ratios.

Abstract: While increasingly large models have revolutionized much of the machine
learning landscape, training even mid-sized networks for Reinforcement Learning
(RL) is still proving to be a struggle. This, however, severely limits the
complexity of policies we are able to learn. To enable increased network
capacity while maintaining network trainability, we propose GrowNN, a simple
yet effective method that utilizes progressive network growth during training.
We start training a small network to learn an initial policy. Then we add
layers without changing the encoded function. Subsequent updates can utilize
the added layers to learn a more expressive policy, adding capacity as the
policy's complexity increases. GrowNN can be seamlessly integrated into most
existing RL agents. Our experiments on MiniHack and Mujoco show improved agent
performance, with incrementally GrowNN-deeper networks outperforming their
respective static counterparts of the same size by up to 48% on MiniHack Room
and 72% on Ant.

Abstract: Graph coarsening aims to diminish the size of a graph to lighten its memory
footprint, and has numerous applications in graph signal processing and machine
learning. It is usually defined using a reduction matrix and a lifting matrix,
which, respectively, allows to project a graph signal from the original graph
to the coarsened one and back. This results in a loss of information measured
by the so-called Restricted Spectral Approximation (RSA). Most coarsening
frameworks impose a fixed relationship between the reduction and lifting
matrices, generally as pseudo-inverses of each other, and seek to define a
coarsening that minimizes the RSA. In this paper, we remark that the roles of
these two matrices are not entirely symmetric: indeed, putting constraints on
the lifting matrix alone ensures the existence of important objects such as the
coarsened graph's adjacency matrix or Laplacian. In light of this, in this
paper, we introduce a more general notion of reduction matrix, that is not
necessarily the pseudo-inverse of the lifting matrix. We establish a taxonomy
of ``admissible'' families of reduction matrices, discuss the different
properties that they must satisfy and whether they admit a closed-form
description or not. We show that, for a fixed coarsening represented by a fixed
lifting matrix, the RSA can be further reduced simply by modifying the
reduction matrix. We explore different examples, including some based on a
constrained optimization process of the RSA. Since this criterion has also been
linked to the performance of Graph Neural Networks, we also illustrate the
impact of this choices on different node classification tasks on coarsened
graphs.

Abstract: Accurate real-time estimation of human movement dynamics, including internal
joint moments and muscle forces, is essential for applications in clinical
diagnostics and sports performance monitoring. Inertial measurement units
(IMUs) provide a minimally intrusive solution for capturing motion data,
particularly when used in sparse sensor configurations. However, current
real-time methods rely on supervised learning, where a ground truth dataset
needs to be measured with laboratory measurement systems, such as optical
motion capture. These systems are known to introduce measurement and processing
errors and often fail to generalize to real-world or previously unseen
movements, necessitating new data collection efforts that are time-consuming
and impractical. To overcome these limitations, we propose SSPINNpose, a
self-supervised, physics-informed neural network that estimates joint
kinematics and kinetics directly from IMU data, without requiring ground truth
labels for training. We run the network output through a physics model of the
human body to optimize physical plausibility and generate virtual measurement
data. Using this virtual sensor data, the network is trained directly on the
measured sensor data instead of a ground truth. When compared to optical motion
capture, SSPINNpose is able to accurately estimate joint angles and joint
moments at an RMSD of 8.7 deg and 4.9 BWBH%, respectively, for walking and
running at speeds up to 4.9 m/s at a latency of 3.5 ms. Furthermore, the
framework demonstrates robustness across sparse sensor configurations and can
infer the anatomical locations of the sensors. These results underscore the
potential of SSPINNpose as a scalable and adaptable solution for real-time
biomechanical analysis in both laboratory and field environments.

Conclusion: 结论指出，基于扰动的评估指标需谨慎解读，未来需开发更全面的评估框架以捕捉归因质量的多个维度。

Abstract: Evaluating feature attribution methods represents a critical challenge in
explainable AI (XAI), as researchers typically rely on perturbation-based
metrics when ground truth is unavailable. However, recent work demonstrates
that these evaluation metrics can show different performance across predicted
classes within the same dataset. These "class-dependent evaluation effects"
raise questions about whether perturbation analysis reliably measures
attribution quality, with direct implications for XAI method development and
the trustworthiness of evaluation techniques. We investigate under which
conditions these class-dependent effects arise by conducting controlled
experiments with synthetic time series data where ground truth feature
locations are known. We systematically vary feature types and class contrasts
across binary classification tasks, then compare perturbation-based degradation
scores with ground truth-based precision-recall metrics using multiple
attribution methods. Our experiments demonstrate that class-dependent effects
emerge with both evaluation approaches even in simple scenarios with temporally
localized features, triggered by basic variations in feature amplitude or
temporal extent between classes. Most critically, we find that
perturbation-based and ground truth metrics frequently yield contradictory
assessments of attribution quality across classes, with weak correlations
between evaluation approaches. These findings suggest that researchers should
interpret perturbation-based metrics with care, as they may not always align
with whether attributions correctly identify discriminating features. These
findings reveal opportunities to reconsider what attribution evaluation
actually measures and to develop more comprehensive evaluation frameworks that
capture multiple dimensions of attribution quality.

Abstract: Rigorous security-focused evaluation of large language model (LLM) agents is
imperative for establishing trust in their safe deployment throughout the
software development lifecycle. However, existing benchmarks largely rely on
synthetic challenges or simplified vulnerability datasets that fail to capture
the complexity and ambiguity encountered by security engineers in practice. We
introduce SEC-bench, the first fully automated benchmarking framework for
evaluating LLM agents on authentic security engineering tasks. SEC-bench
employs a novel multi-agent scaffold that automatically constructs code
repositories with harnesses, reproduces vulnerabilities in isolated
environments, and generates gold patches for reliable evaluation. Our framework
automatically creates high-quality software vulnerability datasets with
reproducible artifacts at a cost of only $0.87 per instance. Using SEC-bench,
we implement two critical software security tasks to rigorously evaluate LLM
agents' capabilities: proof-of-concept (PoC) generation and vulnerability
patching. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM code agents
reveals significant performance gaps, achieving at most 18.0% success in PoC
generation and 34.0% in vulnerability patching on our complete dataset. These
results highlight the crucial steps needed toward developing LLM agents that
are more practical, intelligent, and autonomous for security engineering.

Abstract: Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), there is a
significant research shift from traditional graph learning methods to LLM-based
graph frameworks, formally known as GraphLLMs. GraphLLMs leverage the reasoning
power of LLMs by integrating three key components: the textual attributes of
input nodes, the structural information of node neighborhoods, and
task-specific prompts that guide decision-making. Despite their promise, the
robustness of GraphLLMs against adversarial perturbations remains largely
unexplored-a critical concern for deploying these models in high-stakes
scenarios. To bridge the gap, we introduce TrustGLM, a comprehensive study
evaluating the vulnerability of GraphLLMs to adversarial attacks across three
dimensions: text, graph structure, and prompt manipulations. We implement
state-of-the-art attack algorithms from each perspective to rigorously assess
model resilience. Through extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets from
diverse domains, our findings reveal that GraphLLMs are highly susceptible to
text attacks that merely replace a few semantically similar words in a node's
textual attribute. We also find that standard graph structure attack methods
can significantly degrade model performance, while random shuffling of the
candidate label set in prompt templates leads to substantial performance drops.
Beyond characterizing these vulnerabilities, we investigate defense techniques
tailored to each attack vector through data-augmented training and adversarial
training, which show promising potential to enhance the robustness of
GraphLLMs. We hope that our open-sourced library will facilitate rapid,
equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative research in this field.

Motivation: 概率值在可解释AI中具有重要作用，但精确计算需要指数时间，因此需要高效的近似方法。

Abstract: With origins in game theory, probabilistic values like Shapley values,
Banzhaf values, and semi-values have emerged as a central tool in explainable
AI. They are used for feature attribution, data attribution, data valuation,
and more. Since all of these values require exponential time to compute
exactly, research has focused on efficient approximation methods using two
techniques: Monte Carlo sampling and linear regression formulations. In this
work, we present a new way of combining both of these techniques. Our approach
is more flexible than prior algorithms, allowing for linear regression to be
replaced with any function family whose probabilistic values can be computed
efficiently. This allows us to harness the accuracy of tree-based models like
XGBoost, while still producing unbiased estimates. From experiments across
eight datasets, we find that our methods give state-of-the-art performance for
estimating probabilistic values. For Shapley values, the error of our methods
can be $6.5\times$ lower than Permutation SHAP (the most popular Monte Carlo
method), $3.8\times$ lower than Kernel SHAP (the most popular linear regression
method), and $2.6\times$ lower than Leverage SHAP (the prior state-of-the-art
Shapley value estimator). For more general probabilistic values, we can obtain
error $215\times$ lower than the best estimator from prior work.

Conclusion: 该方法通过元学习和未标记数据的利用，有效提升了分子预测模型在分布外数据上的泛化能力。

Abstract: A widely recognized limitation of molecular prediction models is their
reliance on structures observed in the training data, resulting in poor
generalization to out-of-distribution compounds. Yet in drug discovery, the
compounds most critical for advancing research often lie beyond the training
set, making the bias toward the training data particularly problematic. This
mismatch introduces substantial covariate shift, under which standard deep
learning models produce unstable and inaccurate predictions. Furthermore, the
scarcity of labeled data, stemming from the onerous and costly nature of
experimental validation, further exacerbates the difficulty of achieving
reliable generalization. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
meta-learning-based approach that leverages unlabeled data to interpolate
between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, enabling the
model to meta-learn how to generalize beyond the training distribution. We
demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods on
challenging real-world datasets that exhibit substantial covariate shift.

Abstract: Effective resource management and network slicing are essential to meet the
diverse service demands of vehicular networks, including Enhanced Mobile

This paper introduces an Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning (XRL)
framework for dynamic network slicing and resource allocation in vehicular

Result: 证明S6层能表示Haar小波投影，动态抵消记忆衰减，并在MQAR任务中提供解析解。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Mamba的机制，为改进提供了机会。

Abstract: State-Space Models (SSMs), and particularly Mamba, have recently emerged as a
promising alternative to Transformers. Mamba introduces input selectivity to
its SSM layer (S6) and incorporates convolution and gating into its block
definition. While these modifications do improve Mamba's performance over its
SSM predecessors, it remains largely unclear how Mamba leverages the additional
functionalities provided by input selectivity, and how these interact with the
other operations in the Mamba architecture. In this work, we demystify the role
of input selectivity in Mamba, investigating its impact on function
approximation power, long-term memorization, and associative recall
capabilities. In particular: (i) we prove that the S6 layer of Mamba can
represent projections onto Haar wavelets, providing an edge over its Diagonal
SSM (S4D) predecessor in approximating discontinuous functions commonly arising
in practice; (ii) we show how the S6 layer can dynamically counteract memory
decay; (iii) we provide analytical solutions to the MQAR associative recall
task using the Mamba architecture with different mixers -- Mamba, Mamba-2, and
S4D. We demonstrate the tightness of our theoretical constructions with
empirical results on concrete tasks. Our findings offer a mechanistic
understanding of Mamba and reveal opportunities for improvement.

Abstract: Due to great success of transformers in many applications such as natural
language processing and computer vision, transformers have been successfully
applied in automatic modulation classification. We have shown that
transformer-based radio signal classification is vulnerable to imperceptible
and carefully crafted attacks called adversarial examples. Therefore, we
propose a defense system against adversarial examples in transformer-based
modulation classifications. Considering the need for computationally efficient
architecture particularly for Internet of Things (IoT)-based applications or
operation of devices in environment where power supply is limited, we propose a
compact transformer for modulation classification. The advantages of robust
training such as adversarial training in transformers may not be attainable in
compact transformers. By demonstrating this, we propose a novel compact
transformer that can enhance robustness in the presence of adversarial attacks.
The new method is aimed at transferring the adversarial attention map from the
robustly trained large transformer to a compact transformer. The proposed
method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques for the considered white-box
scenarios including fast gradient method and projected gradient descent
attacks. We have provided reasoning of the underlying working mechanisms and
investigated the transferability of the adversarial examples between different
architectures. The proposed method has the potential to protect the transformer
from the transferability of adversarial examples.

Motivation: 现有方法难以正确处理先验和测量信号之间的冲突，尤其是在非高斯或未知噪声的情况下。

Method: 提出了Measurement-Aligned Sampling (MAS)框架，统一并扩展了现有方法（如DDNM和DAPS），并提供了新的优化视角。

Result: MAS能够处理已知高斯噪声、未知或非高斯噪声，并在实验中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAS为线性逆问题提供了一种更灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models provide a powerful way to incorporate complex prior
information for solving inverse problems. However, existing methods struggle to
correctly incorporate guidance from conflicting signals in the prior and
measurement, especially in the challenging setting of non-Gaussian or unknown
noise. To bridge these gaps, we propose Measurement-Aligned Sampling (MAS), a
novel framework for linear inverse problem solving that can more flexibly
balance prior and measurement information. MAS unifies and extends existing
approaches like DDNM and DAPS, and offers a new optimization perspective. MAS
can generalize to handle known Gaussian noise, unknown or non-Gaussian noise
types. Extensive experiments show that MAS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across a range of tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法无需重放缓冲区或离线训练，适用于在线更新所有网络参数，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We introduce scalable algorithms for online learning and generalized Bayesian
inference of neural network parameters, designed for sequential decision making
tasks. Our methods combine the strengths of frequentist and Bayesian filtering,
which include fast low-rank updates via a block-diagonal approximation of the
parameter error covariance, and a well-defined posterior predictive
distribution that we use for decision making. More precisely, our main method
updates a low-rank error covariance for the hidden layers parameters, and a
full-rank error covariance for the final layer parameters. Although this
characterizes an improper posterior, we show that the resulting posterior
predictive distribution is well-defined. Our methods update all network
parameters online, with no need for replay buffers or offline retraining. We
show, empirically, that our methods achieve a competitive tradeoff between
speed and accuracy on (non-stationary) contextual bandit problems and Bayesian
optimization problems.

Abstract: Advantages of deep learning over traditional methods have been demonstrated
for radio signal classification in the recent years. However, various
researchers have discovered that even a small but intentional feature
perturbation known as adversarial examples can significantly deteriorate the
performance of the deep learning based radio signal classification. Among
various kinds of adversarial examples, universal adversarial perturbation has
gained considerable attention due to its feature of being data independent,
hence as a practical strategy to fool the radio signal classification with a
high success rate. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate a defense system
called neural rejection system to propose against universal adversarial
perturbations, and evaluate its performance by generating white-box universal
adversarial perturbations. We show that the proposed neural rejection system is
able to defend universal adversarial perturbations with significantly higher
accuracy than the undefended deep neural network.

Motivation: 传统独立链采样策略在RL训练中探索能力有限，且需要单独训练奖励模型，容易导致分布不匹配和奖励攻击问题。

Conclusion: TreeRL展示了树搜索在LLM强化学习中的有效性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with tree search has demonstrated superior
performance in traditional reasoning tasks. Compared to conventional
independent chain sampling strategies with outcome supervision, tree search
enables better exploration of the reasoning space and provides dense, on-policy
process rewards during RL training but remains under-explored in On-Policy LLM
RL. We propose TreeRL, a reinforcement learning framework that directly
incorporates on-policy tree search for RL training. Our approach includes
intermediate supervision and eliminates the need for a separate reward model
training. Existing approaches typically train a separate process reward model,
which can suffer from distribution mismatch and reward hacking. We also
introduce a cost-effective tree search approach that achieves higher search
efficiency under the same generation token budget by strategically branching
from high-uncertainty intermediate steps rather than using random branching.
Experiments on challenging math and code reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that
TreeRL achieves superior performance compared to traditional ChainRL,
highlighting the potential of tree search for LLM. TreeRL is open-sourced at

Conclusion: XAStruct为数据驱动的XAS分析和局部结构推断提供了可扩展的解决方案，代码将在论文接受后发布。

Abstract: X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful technique for probing local
atomic environments, yet its interpretation remains limited by the need for
expert-driven analysis, computationally expensive simulations, and
element-specific heuristics. Recent advances in machine learning have shown
promise for accelerating XAS interpretation, but many existing models are
narrowly focused on specific elements, edge types, or spectral regimes. In this
work, we present XAStruct, a learning framework capable of both predicting XAS
spectra from crystal structures and inferring local structural descriptors from
XAS input. XAStruct is trained on a large-scale dataset spanning over 70
elements across the periodic table, enabling generalization to a wide variety
of chemistries and bonding environments. The model includes the first machine
learning approach for predicting neighbor atom types directly from XAS spectra,
as well as a unified regression model for mean nearest-neighbor distance that
requires no element-specific tuning. While we explored integrating the two
pipelines into a single end-to-end model, empirical results showed performance
degradation. As a result, the two tasks were trained independently to ensure
optimal accuracy and task-specific performance. By combining deep neural
networks for complex structure-property mappings with efficient baseline models
for simpler tasks, XAStruct offers a scalable and extensible solution for
data-driven XAS analysis and local structure inference. The source code will be
released upon paper acceptance.

Result: 理论和实验证明，使用优势函数可提升智能体在非轨迹数据上的表现。

Conclusion: 优势函数是解决策略混淆问题的有效工具，能提升强化学习的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that reinforcement learning agents can develop policies
that exploit spurious correlations between rewards and observations. This
phenomenon, known as policy confounding, arises because the agent's policy
influences both past and future observation variables, creating a feedback loop
that can hinder the agent's ability to generalize beyond its usual
trajectories. In this paper, we show that the advantage function, commonly used
in policy gradient methods, not only reduces the variance of gradient estimates
but also mitigates the effects of policy confounding. By adjusting action
values relative to the state representation, the advantage function downweights
state-action pairs that are more likely under the current policy, breaking
spurious correlations and encouraging the agent to focus on causal factors. We
provide both analytical and empirical evidence demonstrating that training with
the advantage function leads to improved out-of-trajectory performance.

Conclusion: 通过RL框架改进自监督预训练，为特征学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), value-based algorithms learn to associate
each observation with the states and rewards that are likely to be reached from
it. We observe that many self-supervised image pre-training methods bear
similarity to this formulation: learning features that associate crops of
images with those of nearby views, e.g., by taking a different crop or color
augmentation. In this paper, we complete this analogy and explore a method that
directly casts pre-training on unlabeled image data like web crawls and video
frames as an RL problem. We train a general value function in a dynamical
system where an agent transforms an image by changing the view or adding image
augmentations. Learning in this way resembles crop-consistency
self-supervision, but through the reward function, offers a simple lever to
shape feature learning using curated images or weakly labeled captions when
they exist. Our experiments demonstrate improved representations when training
on unlabeled images in the wild, including video data like EpicKitchens, scene
data like COCO, and web-crawl data like CC12M.

Abstract: Free-flow road networks, such as suburban highways, are increasingly
experiencing traffic congestion due to growing commuter inflow and limited
infrastructure. Traditional control mechanisms, such as traffic signals or
local heuristics, are ineffective or infeasible in these high-speed,
signal-free environments. We introduce self-regulating cars, a reinforcement
learning-based traffic control protocol that dynamically modulates vehicle
speeds to optimize throughput and prevent congestion, without requiring new
physical infrastructure. Our approach integrates classical traffic flow theory,
gap acceptance models, and microscopic simulation into a physics-informed RL
framework. By abstracting roads into super-segments, the agent captures
emergent flow dynamics and learns robust speed modulation policies from
instantaneous traffic observations. Evaluated in the high-fidelity PTV Vissim
simulator on a real-world highway network, our method improves total throughput
by 5%, reduces average delay by 13%, and decreases total stops by 3% compared
to the no-control setting. It also achieves smoother, congestion-resistant flow
while generalizing across varied traffic patterns, demonstrating its potential
for scalable, ML-driven traffic management.

Abstract: Deep neural networks deployed in safety-critical, resource-constrained

We apply CACTUS for both pruning and quantization and show that it effectively
trains models which can be efficiently compressed while maintaining high
accuracy and certifiable robustness. CACTUS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
and certified performance for both pruning and quantization on a variety of
datasets and input specifications.

challenged the Transformer in language modeling. However, their structure
constrains their applicability to sequences only or requires processing
multi-dimensional data structures, such as images or molecular graphs, in a
pre-defined sequential order. In contrast, Multi-Dimensional RNNs (MDRNNs) are
well suited for data with a higher level structure, like 2D grids, trees, and
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). In this work, we extend the notion of
multi-dimensionality to linear RNNs. We introduce parallelizable Linear Source
Transition Mark networks (pLSTMs) using Source, Transition, and Mark gates that
act on the line graph of a general DAG. This enables parallelization in analogy
to parallel associative scans and the chunkwise-recurrent form of sequential
linear RNNs, but for DAGs. For regular grids (1D and 2D), like images, this
scheme can be efficiently implemented using einsum operations, concatenations,
and padding in logarithmic time. pLSTMs tackle the vanishing/exploding
activation/gradient problem for long distances in DAGs via two distinct modes:
a directed propagation mode (P-mode) and a diffusive distribution mode
(D-mode). To showcase the long-range capabilities of pLSTM, we introduce
arrow-pointing extrapolation as a synthetic computer vision task that contains
long-distance directional information. We demonstrate that pLSTMs generalize
well to larger image sizes, whereas Transformers struggle to extrapolate. On
established molecular graph and computer vision benchmarks, pLSTMs also show
strong performance. Code and Datasets are available at:

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减小文件大小，同时支持近乎无损的恢复，保持模型性能。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于存储受限环境，为高效检查点压缩提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This paper is dedicated to an efficient compression of weights and optimizer
states (called checkpoints) obtained at different stages during a neural
network training process. First, we propose a prediction-based compression
approach, where values from the previously saved checkpoint are used for
context modeling in arithmetic coding. Second, in order to enhance the
compression performance, we also propose to apply pruning and quantization of
the checkpoint values. Experimental results show that our approach achieves
substantial bit size reduction, while enabling near-lossless training recovery
from restored checkpoints, preserving the model's performance and making it
suitable for storage-limited environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经代理模型在未见问题配置下性能下降明显，而领域适应技术在视觉和语言处理中已广泛应用，论文旨在填补这一空白。

Abstract: Neural surrogates for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) often suffer
significant performance degradation when evaluated on unseen problem
configurations, such as novel material types or structural dimensions.
Meanwhile, Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques have been widely used in vision
and language processing to generalize from limited information about unseen
configurations. In this work, we address this gap through two focused
contributions. First, we introduce SIMSHIFT, a novel benchmark dataset and
evaluation suite composed of four industrial simulation tasks: hot rolling,
sheet metal forming, electric motor design and heatsink design. Second, we
extend established domain adaptation methods to state of the art neural
surrogates and systematically evaluate them. These approaches use parametric
descriptions and ground truth simulations from multiple source configurations,
together with only parametric descriptions from target configurations. The goal
is to accurately predict target simulations without access to ground truth
simulation data. Extensive experiments on SIMSHIFT highlight the challenges of
out of distribution neural surrogate modeling, demonstrate the potential of DA
in simulation, and reveal open problems in achieving robust neural surrogates
under distribution shifts in industrially relevant scenarios. Our codebase is

TL;DR: EMLoC是一种基于模拟器的内存高效微调框架，通过LoRA校正，使模型微调在推理所需的内存预算内完成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源基础模型虽强大，但针对特定领域或个性化任务的微调因内存开销大而昂贵，限制了用户使用。

Method: EMLoC利用激活感知SVD构建轻量级模拟器，通过LoRA微调，并提出补偿算法校正LoRA模块。

Result: 实验表明EMLoC在多数据集和模态上优于基线，支持单24GB GPU微调38B模型。

Conclusion: EMLoC为个体用户提供了高效实用的模型适配方案。

Abstract: Open-source foundation models have seen rapid adoption and development,
enabling powerful general-purpose capabilities across diverse domains. However,
fine-tuning large foundation models for domain-specific or personalized tasks
remains prohibitively expensive for most users due to the significant memory
overhead beyond that of inference. We introduce EMLoC, an Emulator-based
Memory-efficient fine-tuning framework with LoRA Correction, which enables
model fine-tuning within the same memory budget required for inference. EMLoC
constructs a task-specific light-weight emulator using activation-aware
singular value decomposition (SVD) on a small downstream calibration set.
Fine-tuning then is performed on this lightweight emulator via LoRA. To tackle
the misalignment between the original model and the compressed emulator, we
propose a novel compensation algorithm to correct the fine-tuned LoRA module,
which thus can be merged into the original model for inference. EMLoC supports
flexible compression ratios and standard training pipelines, making it
adaptable to a wide range of applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that EMLoC outperforms other baselines across multiple datasets and modalities.
Moreover, without quantization, EMLoC enables fine-tuning of a 38B model on a
single 24GB consumer GPU-bringing efficient and practical model adaptation to
individual users.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多目标遗传算法ParetoCSP2，用于预测无机多晶型结构，通过自适应空间群多样性控制和神经网络原子间势提高预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多晶型材料的不同结构排列具有独特的物理性质，但现有的晶体结构预测算法有限，亟需高效方法指导合成和发现新材料。

Method: ParetoCSP2结合自适应空间群多样性控制、神经网络原子间势和改进的种群初始化方法，避免过早收敛并提升收敛速度。

Result: 在基准测试中，ParetoCSP2在多晶型预测中表现优异，空间群和结构相似性准确率显著优于基线算法。

Conclusion: ParetoCSP2为无机多晶型结构预测提供了高效工具，性能显著提升，代码已开源。

Abstract: Crystalline materials can form different structural arrangements (i.e.
polymorphs) with the same chemical composition, exhibiting distinct physical
properties depending on how they were synthesized or the conditions under which
they operate. For example, carbon can exist as graphite (soft, conductive) or
diamond (hard, insulating). Computational methods that can predict these
polymorphs are vital in materials science, which help understand stability
relationships, guide synthesis efforts, and discover new materials with desired
properties without extensive trial-and-error experimentation. However,
effective crystal structure prediction (CSP) algorithms for inorganic polymorph
structures remain limited. We propose ParetoCSP2, a multi-objective genetic
algorithm for polymorphism CSP that incorporates an adaptive space group
diversity control technique, preventing over-representation of any single space
group in the population guided by a neural network interatomic potential. Using
an improved population initialization method and performing iterative structure
relaxation, ParetoCSP2 not only alleviates premature convergence but also
achieves improved convergence speed. Our results show that ParetoCSP2 achieves
excellent performance in polymorphism prediction, including a nearly perfect
space group and structural similarity accuracy for formulas with two polymorphs
but with the same number of unit cell atoms. Evaluated on a benchmark dataset,
it outperforms baseline algorithms by factors of 2.46-8.62 for these accuracies
and improves by 44.8\%-87.04\% across key performance metrics for regular CSP.

TL;DR: 全球森林在1988-2021年间总体为碳汇，但热带湿润森林和北方森林逐渐转为碳源，表明气候变化对森林碳动态的影响加剧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究全球森林地上碳（AGC）的长期动态及其碳汇-源转换的不确定性，以应对气候变化和森林管理的挑战。

Method: 通过整合多源卫星观测数据和概率深度学习模型，估算高空间分辨率的全球森林AGC及其不确定性。

Result: 全球森林30年间保持6.2 PgC的碳汇，但热带湿润森林和北方森林在2001年后逐渐转为碳源，巴西亚马逊未受干扰区域的碳损失贡献显著增加。

Conclusion: 热带森林AGC在调节陆地碳循环中的作用增强，人为气候变化可能进一步影响未受干扰区域的碳动态。

Abstract: As enduring carbon sinks, forest ecosystems are vital to the terrestrial
carbon cycle and help moderate global warming. However, the long-term dynamics
of aboveground carbon (AGC) in forests and their sink-source transitions remain
highly uncertain, owing to changing disturbance regimes and inconsistencies in
observations, data processing, and analysis methods. Here, we derive reliable,
harmonized AGC stocks and fluxes in global forests from 1988 to 2021 at high
spatial resolution by integrating multi-source satellite observations with
probabilistic deep learning models. Our approach simultaneously estimates AGC
and associated uncertainties, showing high reliability across space and time.
We find that, although global forests remained an AGC sink of 6.2 PgC over 30
years, moist tropical forests shifted to a substantial AGC source between 2001
and 2010 and, together with boreal forests, transitioned toward a source in the
2011-2021 period. Temperate, dry tropical and subtropical forests generally
exhibited increasing AGC stocks, although Europe and Australia became sources
after 2011. Regionally, pronounced sink-to-source transitions occurred in
tropical forests over the past three decades. The interannual relationship
between global atmospheric CO2 growth rates and tropical AGC flux variability
became increasingly negative, reaching Pearson's r = -0.63 (p < 0.05) in the
most recent decade. In the Brazilian Amazon, the contribution of deforested
regions to AGC losses declined from 60% in 1989-2000 to 13% in 2011-2021, while
the share from untouched areas increased from 33% to 76%. Our findings suggest
a growing role of tropical forest AGC in modulating variability in the
terrestrial carbon cycle, with anthropogenic climate change potentially
contributing increasingly to AGC changes, particularly in previously untouched
areas.

Conclusion: 本文首次将合作博弈论概念直接与强化学习概念结合，为解决NAHT问题提供了理论支持和新方法。

Abstract: Open multi-agent systems are increasingly important in modeling real-world
applications, such as smart grids, swarm robotics, etc. In this paper, we aim
to investigate a recently proposed problem for open multi-agent systems,
referred to as n-agent ad hoc teamwork (NAHT), where only a number of agents
are controlled. Existing methods tend to be based on heuristic design and
consequently lack theoretical rigor and ambiguous credit assignment among
agents. To address these limitations, we model and solve NAHT through the lens
of cooperative game theory. More specifically, we first model an open
multi-agent system, characterized by its value, as an instance situated in a
space of cooperative games, generated by a set of basis games. We then extend
this space, along with the state space, to accommodate dynamic scenarios,
thereby characterizing NAHT. Exploiting the justifiable assumption that basis
game values correspond to a sequence of n-step returns with different horizons,
we represent the state values for NAHT in a form similar to $\lambda$-returns.
Furthermore, we derive Shapley values to allocate state values to the
controlled agents, as credits for their contributions to the ad hoc team.
Different from the conventional approach to shaping Shapley values in an
explicit form, we shape Shapley values by fulfilling the three axioms uniquely
describing them, well defined on the extended game space describing NAHT. To
estimate Shapley values in dynamic scenarios, we propose a TD($\lambda$)-like
algorithm. The resulting reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is referred to
as Shapley Machine. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that the
concepts from cooperative game theory are directly related to RL concepts. In
experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Shapley Machine and verify
reasonableness of our theory.

Result: 实验表明，提出的初始化策略在性能上优于传统深度自编码器。

Conclusion: 对称自编码器的设计与初始化对其性能至关重要，EYS初始化策略为理论支持提供了新方向。

Abstract: Deep autoencoders have become a fundamental tool in various machine learning
applications, ranging from dimensionality reduction and reduced order modeling
of partial differential equations to anomaly detection and neural machine
translation. Despite their empirical success, a solid theoretical foundation
for their expressiveness remains elusive, particularly when compared to
classical projection-based techniques. In this work, we aim to take a step
forward in this direction by presenting a comprehensive analysis of what we
refer to as symmetric autoencoders, a broad class of deep learning
architectures ubiquitous in the literature. Specifically, we introduce a formal
distinction between different classes of symmetric architectures, analyzing
their strengths and limitations from a mathematical perspective. For instance,
we show that the reconstruction error of symmetric autoencoders with
orthonormality constraints can be understood by leveraging the well-renowned
Eckart-Young-Schmidt (EYS) theorem. As a byproduct of our analysis, we end up
developing the EYS initialization strategy for symmetric autoencoders, which is
based on an iterated application of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). To
validate our findings, we conduct a series of numerical experiments where we
benchmark our proposal against conventional deep autoencoders, discussing the
importance of model design and initialization.

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法为逆问题提供了新方向，但仍存在未解决问题，未来研究需进一步探索。

Abstract: Inverse problems are concerned with the reconstruction of unknown physical
quantities using indirect measurements and are fundamental across diverse
fields such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and material sciences. These
problems serve as critical tools for visualizing internal structures beyond
what is visible to the naked eye, enabling quantification, diagnosis,
prediction, and discovery. However, most inverse problems are ill-posed,
necessitating robust mathematical treatment to yield meaningful solutions.
While classical approaches provide mathematically rigorous and computationally
stable solutions, they are constrained by the ability to accurately model
solution properties and implement them efficiently.
  A more recent paradigm considers deriving solutions to inverse problems in a
data-driven manner. Instead of relying on classical mathematical modeling, this
approach utilizes highly over-parameterized models, typically deep neural
networks, which are adapted to specific inverse problems using carefully
selected training data. Current approaches that follow this new paradigm
distinguish themselves through solution accuracy paired with computational
efficiency that was previously inconceivable.
  These notes offer an introduction to this data-driven paradigm for inverse
problems. The first part of these notes will provide an introduction to inverse
problems, discuss classical solution strategies, and present some applications.
The second part will delve into modern data-driven approaches, with a
particular focus on adversarial regularization and provably convergent linear
plug-and-play denoisers. Throughout the presentation of these methodologies,
their theoretical properties will be discussed, and numerical examples will be
provided. The lecture series will conclude with a discussion of open problems
and future perspectives in the field.

Result: FeNN在模拟SNN分类器时，速度超过嵌入式GPU和Loihi神经形态系统。

Conclusion: FeNN为SNN模拟提供了一种高效、可编程的解决方案，适用于从边缘到云端的标准计算机应用。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have the potential to drastically reduce the
energy requirements of AI systems. However, mainstream accelerators like GPUs
and TPUs are designed for the high arithmetic intensity of standard ANNs so are
not well-suited to SNN simulation. FPGAs are well-suited to applications with
low arithmetic intensity as they have high off-chip memory bandwidth and large
amounts of on-chip memory. Here, we present a novel RISC-V-based soft vector
processor (FeNN), tailored to simulating SNNs on FPGAs. Unlike most dedicated
neuromorphic hardware, FeNN is fully programmable and designed to be integrated
with applications running on standard computers from the edge to the cloud. We
demonstrate that, by using stochastic rounding and saturation, FeNN can achieve
high numerical precision with low hardware utilisation and that a single FeNN
core can simulate an SNN classifier faster than both an embedded GPU and the
Loihi neuromorphic system.

Conclusion: HQFNN为视觉任务提供了一种紧凑、可解释且抗噪声的解决方案，为未来量子模糊学习框架奠定了基础。

Abstract: Deep learning vision systems excel at pattern recognition yet falter when
inputs are noisy or the model must explain its own confidence. Fuzzy inference,
with its graded memberships and rule transparency, offers a remedy, while
parameterized quantum circuits can embed features in richly entangled Hilbert
spaces with striking parameter efficiency. Bridging these ideas, this study
introduces a innovative Highly Quantized Fuzzy Neural Network (HQFNN) that
realises the entire fuzzy pipeline inside a shallow quantum circuit and couples
the resulting quantum signal to a lightweight CNN feature extractor. Each image
feature is first mapped to a single qubit membership state through repeated
angle reuploading. Then a compact rule layer refines these amplitudes, and a
clustered CNOT defuzzifier collapses them into one crisp value that is fused
with classical features before classification. Evaluated on standard image
benchmarks, HQFNN consistently surpasses classical, fuzzy enhanced and quantum
only baselines while using several orders of magnitude fewer trainable weights,
and its accuracy degrades only marginally under simulated depolarizing and
amplitude damping noise, evidence of intrinsic robustness. Gate count analysis
further shows that circuit depth grows sublinearly with input dimension,
confirming the model's practicality for larger images. These results position
the model as a compact, interpretable and noise tolerant alternative to
conventional vision backbones and provide a template for future quantum native
fuzzy learning frameworks.

Abstract: Quantum error correction is crucial for protecting quantum information
against decoherence. Traditional codes like the surface code require
substantial overhead, making them impractical for near-term, early
fault-tolerant devices. We propose a novel objective function for tailoring
error correction codes to specific noise structures by maximizing the
distinguishability between quantum states after a noise channel, ensuring
efficient recovery operations. We formalize this concept with the
distinguishability loss function, serving as a machine learning objective to
discover resource-efficient encoding circuits optimized for given noise
characteristics. We implement this methodology using variational techniques,
termed variational quantum error correction (VarQEC). Our approach yields codes
with desirable theoretical and practical properties and outperforms standard
codes in various scenarios. We also provide proof-of-concept demonstrations on
IBM and IQM hardware devices, highlighting the practical relevance of our
procedure.

Abstract: Interpretable machine learning is rapidly becoming a crucial tool for
scientific discovery. Among existing approaches, variational autoencoders
(VAEs) have shown promise in extracting the hidden physical features of some
input data, with no supervision nor prior knowledge of the system at study.
Yet, the ability of VAEs to create meaningful, interpretable representations
relies on their accurate approximation of the underlying probability
distribution of their input. When dealing with quantum data, VAEs must hence
account for its intrinsic randomness and complex correlations. While VAEs have
been previously applied to quantum data, they have often neglected its
probabilistic nature, hindering the extraction of meaningful physical
descriptors. Here, we demonstrate that two key modifications enable VAEs to
learn physically meaningful latent representations: a decoder capable of
faithfully reproduce quantum states and a probabilistic loss tailored to this
task. Using benchmark quantum spin models, we identify regimes where standard
methods fail while the representations learned by our approach remain
meaningful and interpretable. Applied to experimental data from Rydberg atom
arrays, the model autonomously uncovers the phase structure without access to
prior labels, Hamiltonian details, or knowledge of relevant order parameters,
highlighting its potential as an unsupervised and interpretable tool for the
study of quantum systems.

particularly difficult when observations have a strong stochastic component,
yielding diverse yet equivalent patterns. Traditional inverse methods fail in
this setting, as pixel-wise metrics cannot capture feature similarities between
variable outcomes. In this work, we introduce a novel inverse modelling method
specifically designed to handle stochasticity in the observable space,
leveraging the capacity of visual embeddings to produce robust representations
that capture perceptual invariances. By mapping the pattern representations
onto an invariant embedding space, we can effectively recover unknown causal
parameters without the need for handcrafted objective functions or heuristics.
We evaluate the method on two canonical models--a reaction-diffusion system and
an agent-based model of social segregation--and show that it reliably recovers
parameters despite stochasticity in the outcomes. We further apply the method
to real biological patterns, highlighting its potential as a tool for both
theorists and experimentalists to investigate the dynamics underlying complex
stochastic pattern formation.

### [317] [SwiftSpec: Ultra-Low Latency LLM Decoding by Scaling Asynchronous Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11309)
*Ziyi Zhang,Ziheng Jiang,Chengquan Jiang,Menghan Yu,Size Zheng,Haibin Lin,Henry Hoffmann,Xin Liu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: SwiftSpec通过异步和分散式设计优化了推测解码流程，显著提升了大型语言模型的解码速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有推测解码和并行计算结合时的计算不平衡、KV缓存不一致及通信开销问题。

Method: 采用并行树生成、树感知KV缓存管理和优化内核设计。

Result: 在5种模型和6个数据集上平均提速1.75倍，Llama3-70B解码速度达348 tokens/s。

Conclusion: SwiftSpec是目前最快的大规模低延迟LLM服务系统。

Abstract: Low-latency decoding for large language models (LLMs) is crucial for
applications like chatbots and code assistants, yet generating long outputs
remains slow in single-query settings. Prior work on speculative decoding
(which combines a small draft model with a larger target model) and tensor
parallelism has each accelerated decoding. However, conventional approaches
fail to apply both simultaneously due to imbalanced compute requirements
(between draft and target models), KV-cache inconsistencies, and communication
overheads under small-batch tensor-parallelism. This paper introduces
SwiftSpec, a system that targets ultra-low latency for LLM decoding. SwiftSpec
redesigns the speculative decoding pipeline in an asynchronous and
disaggregated manner, so that each component can be scaled flexibly and remove
draft overhead from the critical path. To realize this design, SwiftSpec
proposes parallel tree generation, tree-aware KV cache management, and fused,
latency-optimized kernels to overcome the challenges listed above. Across 5
model families and 6 datasets, SwiftSpec achieves an average of 1.75x speedup
over state-of-the-art speculative decoding systems and, as a highlight, serves
Llama3-70B at 348 tokens/s on 8 Nvidia Hopper GPUs, making it the fastest known
system for low-latency LLM serving at this scale.

*Jiajun He,Tomoki Toda*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于音素增强的多模态融合方法（PMF-CEC），用于改进端到端自动语音识别（ASR）中对罕见词（尤其是同音异义词）的识别准确性。该方法在原有ED-CEC基础上优化，并引入保留概率机制以减少误检。实验表明，PMF-CEC在推理速度和错误率上优于ED-CEC及其他上下文偏置方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASR模型在识别罕见词（尤其是同音异义词）时准确性不足，且原有ED-CEC方法存在误检问题。

Method: 提出PMF-CEC方法，结合音素信息增强多模态融合，并引入保留概率机制过滤低置信度编辑操作。

Result: 在五个数据集上验证，PMF-CEC降低了偏置词错误率，尤其在纠正同音异义词上表现更优，且推理速度快于其他方法。

Conclusion: PMF-CEC在罕见词识别和同音异义词纠正上具有显著优势，且推理效率高，优于现有方法。

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models often struggle to
accurately recognize rare words. Previously, we introduced an ASR
postprocessing method called error detection and context-aware error correction
(ED-CEC), which leverages contextual information such as named entities and
technical terms to improve the accuracy of ASR transcripts. Although ED-CEC
achieves a notable success in correcting rare words, its accuracy remains low
when dealing with rare words that have similar pronunciations but different
spellings. To address this issue, we proposed a phoneme-augmented multimodal
fusion method for context-aware error correction (PMF-CEC) method on the basis
of ED-CEC, which allowed for better differentiation between target rare words
and homophones. Additionally, we observed that the previous ASR error detection
module suffers from overdetection. To mitigate this, we introduced a retention
probability mechanism to filter out editing operations with confidence scores
below a set threshold, preserving the original operation to improve error
detection accuracy. Experiments conducted on five datasets demonstrated that
our proposed PMF-CEC maintains reasonable inference speed while further
reducing the biased word error rate compared with ED-CEC, showing a stronger
advantage in correcting homophones. Moreover, our method outperforms other
contextual biasing methods, and remains valuable compared with LLM-based
methods in terms of faster inference and better robustness under large biasing
lists.

Motivation: 构音障碍和老年语音识别面临数据稀缺、分布不均和说话者异质性等挑战，而联邦学习虽保护隐私但加剧了这些问题。

Method: 采用参数、嵌入和新型损失正则化方法，优化联邦学习过程。

Result: 在UASpeech和DementiaBank数据集上，正则化联邦学习系统显著优于基线FedAvg，WER降低0.55%（绝对）。

Conclusion: 正则化联邦学习能有效提升隐私保护下的语音识别性能，接近集中式训练效果。

Abstract: Accurate recognition of dysarthric and elderly speech remains challenging to
date. While privacy concerns have driven a shift from centralized approaches to
federated learning (FL) to ensure data confidentiality, this further
exacerbates the challenges of data scarcity, imbalanced data distribution and
speaker heterogeneity. To this end, this paper conducts a systematic
investigation of regularized FL techniques for privacy-preserving dysarthric
and elderly speech recognition, addressing different levels of the FL process
by 1) parameter-based, 2) embedding-based and 3) novel loss-based
regularization. Experiments on the benchmark UASpeech dysarthric and
DementiaBank Pitt elderly speech corpora suggest that regularized FL systems
consistently outperform the baseline FedAvg system by statistically significant
WER reductions of up to 0.55\% absolute (2.13\% relative). Further increasing
communication frequency to one exchange per batch approaches centralized
training performance.

Result: TTS模型对MX的可懂度不足，表现显著差于专家朗读，LLM选择影响有限。

Conclusion: 需改进TTS模型以更好地处理数学表达式。

Abstract: There has been limited evaluation of advanced Text-to-Speech (TTS) models
with Mathematical eXpressions (MX) as inputs. In this work, we design
experiments to evaluate quality and intelligibility of five TTS models through
listening and transcribing tests for various categories of MX. We use two Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate English pronunciation from LaTeX MX as TTS
models cannot process LaTeX directly. We use Mean Opinion Score from user
ratings and quantify intelligibility through transcription correctness using
three metrics. We also compare listener preference of TTS outputs with respect
to human expert rendition of same MX. Results establish that output of TTS
models for MX is not necessarily intelligible, the gap in intelligibility
varies across TTS models and MX category. For most categories, performance of
TTS models is significantly worse than that of expert rendition. The effect of
choice of LLM is limited. This establishes the need to improve TTS models for
MX.

Result: 实验表明，与传统方法相比，该方法显著提高了转录准确性，并在半监督ASR模型中表现更优。

Conclusion: 该框架为ASR训练提供了一种高效且准确的伪标签生成方法。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) models rely on high-quality transcribed
data for effective training. Generating pseudo-labels for large unlabeled audio
datasets often relies on complex pipelines that combine multiple ASR outputs
through multi-stage processing, leading to error propagation, information loss
and disjoint optimization. We propose a unified multi-ASR prompt-driven
framework using postprocessing by either textual or speech-based large language
models (LLMs), replacing voting or other arbitration logic for reconciling the
ensemble outputs. We perform a comparative study of multiple architectures with
and without LLMs, showing significant improvements in transcription accuracy
compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, we use the pseudo-labels
generated by the various approaches to train semi-supervised ASR models for
different datasets, again showing improved performance with textual and
speechLLM transcriptions compared to baselines.

Result: 发现工具间特征差异显著，影响模型在不同背景和人群中的性能。

Conclusion: 建议进行领域相关验证，以提高临床应用中机器学习模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Machine learning-based behavioral models rely on features extracted from
audio-visual recordings. The recordings are processed using open-source tools
to extract speech features for classification models. These tools often lack
validation to ensure reliability in capturing behaviorally relevant
information. This gap raises concerns about reproducibility and fairness across
diverse populations and contexts. Speech processing tools, when used outside of
their design context, can fail to capture behavioral variations equitably and
can then contribute to bias. We evaluate speech features extracted from two
widely used speech analysis tools, OpenSMILE and Praat, to assess their
reliability when considering adolescents with autism. We observed considerable
variation in features across tools, which influenced model performance across
context and demographic groups. We encourage domain-relevant verification to
enhance the reliability of machine learning models in clinical applications.

Conclusion: RecFound通过创新的多任务训练方案，为推荐基础模型提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Developing a single foundation model with the capability to excel across
diverse tasks has been a long-standing objective in the field of artificial
intelligence. As the wave of general-purpose foundation models sweeps across
various domains, their influence has significantly extended to the field of
recommendation systems. While recent efforts have explored recommendation
foundation models for various generative tasks, they often overlook crucial
embedding tasks and struggle with the complexities of multi-task learning,
including knowledge sharing & conflict resolution, and convergence speed
inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we introduce RecFound, a
generative representational learning framework for recommendation foundation
models. We construct the first comprehensive dataset for recommendation
foundation models covering both generative and embedding tasks across diverse
scenarios. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel multi-task training scheme
featuring a Task-wise Mixture of Low-rank Experts (TMoLE) to handle knowledge
sharing & conflict, a Step-wise Convergence-oriented Sample Scheduler (S2Sched)
to address inconsistent convergence, and a Model Merge module to balance the
performance across tasks. Experiments demonstrate that RecFound achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various recommendation tasks, outperforming

Abstract: With the rapid growth of Internet services, recommendation systems play a
central role in delivering personalized content. Faced with massive user
requests and complex model architectures, the key challenge for real-time
recommendation systems is how to reduce inference latency and increase system
throughput without sacrificing recommendation quality. This paper addresses the
high computational cost and resource bottlenecks of deep learning models in
real-time settings by proposing a combined set of modeling- and system-level
acceleration and optimization strategies. At the model level, we dramatically
reduce parameter counts and compute requirements through lightweight network
design, structured pruning, and weight quantization. At the system level, we
integrate multiple heterogeneous compute platforms and high-performance
inference libraries, and we design elastic inference scheduling and
load-balancing mechanisms based on real-time load characteristics. Experiments
show that, while maintaining the original recommendation accuracy, our methods
cut latency to less than 30% of the baseline and more than double system
throughput, offering a practical solution for deploying large-scale online
recommendation services.

Motivation: 传统NLP方法在识别隐式因果关系时表现不佳，尤其是在数据稀缺的情况下。GraphRAG-Causal旨在通过结构化因果知识图谱和混合检索系统解决这一问题。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：数据准备（标注新闻标题并转换为因果图）、图检索（存储图谱并利用混合查询匹配事件）、LLM推理（基于检索结果进行少样本学习）。

Result: 实验显示，仅用20个少样本示例，GraphRAG-Causal在因果分类任务中达到82.1%的F1分数。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了准确性和一致性，适用于新闻可靠性评估、虚假信息检测和政策分析等实时应用。

Abstract: GraphRAG-Causal introduces an innovative framework that combines graph-based
retrieval with large language models to enhance causal reasoning in news
analysis. Traditional NLP approaches often struggle with identifying complex,
implicit causal links, especially in low-data scenarios. Our approach addresses
these challenges by transforming annotated news headlines into structured
causal knowledge graphs. It then employs a hybrid retrieval system that merges
semantic embeddings with graph-based structural cues leveraging Neo4j to
accurately match and retrieve relevant events. The framework is built on a
three-stage pipeline: First, during Data Preparation, news sentences are
meticulously annotated and converted into causal graphs capturing cause,
effect, and trigger relationships. Next, the Graph Retrieval stage stores these
graphs along with their embeddings in a Neo4j database and utilizes hybrid
Cypher queries to efficiently identify events that share both semantic and
structural similarities with a given query. Finally, the LLM Inference stage
utilizes these retrieved causal graphs in a few-shot learning setup with
XML-based prompting, enabling robust classification and tagging of causal
relationships. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that GraphRAG-Causal
achieves an impressive F1-score of 82.1% on causal classification using just 20
few-shot examples. This approach significantly boosts accuracy and consistency,
making it highly suitable for real-time applications in news reliability
assessment, misinformation detection, and policy analysis.

Poutine-Base in a self-supervised vision-language-trajectory (VLT) next-token
prediction fashion on 83 hours of CoVLA nominal driving and 11 hours of Waymo
long-tail driving. Accompanying language annotations are auto-generated with a

Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using less than 500 preference-labeled

fine-tuning are critical to attain strong driving performance in the long-tail.
Poutine-Base achieves a rater-feedback score (RFS) of 8.12 on the validation

achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the official Waymo test set, placing 1st in the 2025

Abstract: Robotic manipulation faces a significant challenge in generalizing across
unseen objects, environments and tasks specified by diverse language
instructions. To improve generalization capabilities, recent research has
incorporated large language models (LLMs) for planning and action execution.
While promising, these methods often fall short in generating grounded plans in
visual environments. Although efforts have been made to perform visual
instructional tuning on LLMs for robotic manipulation, existing methods are
typically constrained by single-view image input and struggle with precise
object grounding. In this work, we introduce Gondola, a novel grounded
vision-language planning model based on LLMs for generalizable robotic
manipulation. Gondola takes multi-view images and history plans to produce the
next action plan with interleaved texts and segmentation masks of target
objects and locations. To support the training of Gondola, we construct three
types of datasets using the RLBench simulator, namely robot grounded planning,
multi-view referring expression and pseudo long-horizon task datasets. Gondola
outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM-based method across all four
generalization levels of the GemBench dataset, including novel placements,
rigid objects, articulated objects and long-horizon tasks.

high-precision robot manipulators. These sensory cues naturally compensate for
high levels of uncertainties that exist in the manufacturing environment.
Uncertainties in performing manufacturing tasks may come from measurement
noise, model inaccuracy, joint compliance (e.g., elasticity), etc. Although
advanced metrology sensors and high precision microprocessors, which are
utilized in modern robots, have compensated for many structural and dynamic
errors in robot positioning, a well-designed control algorithm still works as a
comparable and cheaper alternative to reduce uncertainties in automated
manufacturing. Our work illustrates that a multi-robot control system that
simulates the positioning process for fastening and unfastening applications
can reduce various uncertainties, which may occur in this process, to a great
extent. In addition, most research papers in visual servoing mainly focus on
developing control and observation architectures in various scenarios, but few
have discussed the importance of the camera's location in the configuration. In
a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary
significantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects
of environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image
shot at different locations. Therefore, in this paper, we also propose a novel
algorithm for the camera's moving policy so that it explores the camera
workspace and searches for the optimal location where the image noise level is
minimized.

*Shijie Fang,Hang Yu,Qidi Fang,Reuben M. Aronson,Elaine S. Short*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文研究了非专家演示中的非最优行为，发现这些行为是系统性的，称为“演示侧轨”，并分析了其类型和分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LfD方法通常将人类演示中的不完美视为随机噪声，但本文认为这些非最优行为是系统性的，需要更精确的建模。

Method: 通过40名参与者的公共空间研究，模拟实验并标注演示，识别了四种侧轨类型和一种控制模式。

Result: 侧轨在参与者中频繁出现，其时空分布与任务上下文相关；控制模式依赖于控制界面。

Conclusion: 研究强调了改进非最优演示模型的必要性，以提升LfD算法，缩小实验室训练与实际部署的差距。

Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a popular approach for robots to acquire
new skills, but most LfD methods suffer from imperfections in human
demonstrations. Prior work typically treats these suboptimalities as random
noise. In this paper we study non-optimal behaviors in non-expert
demonstrations and show that they are systematic, forming what we call
demonstration sidetracks. Using a public space study with 40 participants
performing a long-horizon robot task, we recreated the setup in simulation and
annotated all demonstrations. We identify four types of sidetracks
(Exploration, Mistake, Alignment, Pause) and one control pattern (one-dimension
control). Sidetracks appear frequently across participants, and their temporal
and spatial distribution is tied to task context. We also find that users'
control patterns depend on the control interface. These insights point to the
need for better models of suboptimal demonstrations to improve LfD algorithms
and bridge the gap between lab training and real-world deployment. All
demonstrations, infrastructure, and annotations are available at

Abstract: For autonomous vehicles, safe navigation in complex environments depends on
handling a broad range of diverse and rare driving scenarios. Simulation- and
scenario-based testing have emerged as key approaches to development and
validation of autonomous driving systems. Traditional scenario generation
relies on rule-based systems, knowledge-driven models, and data-driven
synthesis, often producing limited diversity and unrealistic safety-critical
cases. With the emergence of foundation models, which represent a new
generation of pre-trained, general-purpose AI models, developers can process
heterogeneous inputs (e.g., natural language, sensor data, HD maps, and control
actions), enabling the synthesis and interpretation of complex driving
scenarios. In this paper, we conduct a survey about the application of
foundation models for scenario generation and scenario analysis in autonomous
driving (as of May 2025). Our survey presents a unified taxonomy that includes
large language models, vision-language models, multimodal large language
models, diffusion models, and world models for the generation and analysis of
autonomous driving scenarios. In addition, we review the methodologies,
open-source datasets, simulation platforms, and benchmark challenges, and we
examine the evaluation metrics tailored explicitly to scenario generation and
analysis. Finally, the survey concludes by highlighting the open challenges and
research questions, and outlining promising future research directions. All
reviewed papers are listed in a continuously maintained repository, which

Abstract: The Robot Context Protocol (RCP) is a lightweight, middleware-agnostic
communication protocol designed to simplify the complexity of robotic systems
and enable seamless interaction between robots, users, and autonomous agents.
RCP provides a unified and semantically meaningful interface that decouples
client-facing operations from backend implementations, supporting a wide range
of deployment environments including physical robots, cloud-based
orchestrators, and simulated platforms. Built on HTTP and WebSocket transport
layers, the protocol defines a schema-driven message format with structured
operations such as read, write, execute, and subscribe. It integrates features
such as runtime introspection, asynchronous feedback, multi-tenant namespace
isolation, and strict type validation to ensure robustness, scalability, and
security. The architecture, message structure, interface model, and
adapter-based backend integration strategy of RCP are described, along with
deployment practices and applicability across industries including
manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare. RCP enables intelligent, resilient,
and safe robotic operations in complex, multi-agent ecosystems.

TL;DR: SAIL系统通过一致性动作推断、高保真跟踪、自适应速度调节和动作调度，实现了离线模仿学习策略的加速执行，最高可达演示速度的4倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离线模仿学习方法无法调整任务执行速度，限制了机器人系统的吞吐量，特别是在工业自动化等应用中。

Method: SAIL系统整合了四个关键组件：一致性动作推断、高保真跟踪、自适应速度调节和动作调度。

Result: 在12个任务中，SAIL在仿真中实现了最高4倍的速度提升，在真实机器人中达到3.2倍。

Conclusion: SAIL成功解决了离线模仿学习策略的加速执行问题，显著提升了任务吞吐量。

Abstract: Offline Imitation Learning (IL) methods such as Behavior Cloning are
effective at acquiring complex robotic manipulation skills. However, existing
IL-trained policies are confined to executing the task at the same speed as
shown in demonstration data. This limits the task throughput of a robotic
system, a critical requirement for applications such as industrial automation.
In this paper, we introduce and formalize the novel problem of enabling
faster-than-demonstration execution of visuomotor policies and identify
fundamental challenges in robot dynamics and state-action distribution shifts.
We instantiate the key insights as SAIL (Speed Adaptation for Imitation
Learning), a full-stack system integrating four tightly-connected components:
(1) a consistency-preserving action inference algorithm for smooth motion at
high speed, (2) high-fidelity tracking of controller-invariant motion targets,
(3) adaptive speed modulation that dynamically adjusts execution speed based on
motion complexity, and (4) action scheduling to handle real-world system
latencies. Experiments on 12 tasks across simulation and two real, distinct
robot platforms show that SAIL achieves up to a 4x speedup over demonstration
speed in simulation and up to 3.2x speedup in the real world. Additional detail

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种硬件高效的深度神经网络（DNN），通过硬件感知的神经架构搜索（HW-NAS）优化，用于资源受限的物联网（IoT）和边缘设备上的加密流量分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对资源受限的IoT和边缘设备，需要一种高效的DNN模型来实时分析加密流量，同时满足严格的内存和计算限制。

Method: 采用HW-NAS优化1D卷积神经网络（CNN），在ISCX VPN-nonVPN数据集上进行训练，并结合头级预处理策略。

Result: 优化后的模型在分类任务中达到96.59%的准确率，参数和计算量大幅减少，且在多种配置下表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为IoT网络安全提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，但需注意预处理和会话长度选择对性能的影响。

Abstract: This paper presents a hardware-efficient deep neural network (DNN), optimized
through hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS); the DNN supports
the classification of session-level encrypted traffic on resource-constrained
Internet of Things (IoT) and edge devices. Thanks to HW-NAS, a 1D convolutional
neural network (CNN) is tailored on the ISCX VPN-nonVPN dataset to meet strict
memory and computational limits while achieving robust performance. The
optimized model attains an accuracy of 96.59% with just 88.26K parameters,
10.08M FLOPs, and a maximum tensor size of 20.12K. Compared to state-of-the-art
models, it achieves reductions of up to 444-fold, 312-fold, and 15.6-fold in
these metrics, respectively, significantly minimizing memory footprint and
runtime requirements. The model also demonstrates versatility in classification
tasks, achieving accuracies of up to 99.64% in VPN differentiation, VPN-type
classification, broader traffic categories, and application identification. In
addition, an in-depth approach to header-level preprocessing strategies
confirms that the optimized model can provide notable performances across a
wide range of configurations, even in scenarios with stricter privacy
considerations. Likewise, a reduction in the length of sessions of up to 75%
yields significant improvements in efficiency, while maintaining high accuracy
with only a negligible drop of 1-2%. However, the importance of careful
preprocessing and session length selection in the classification of raw traffic
data is still present, as improper settings or aggressive reductions can bring
about a 7% reduction in overall accuracy. Those results highlight the method's
effectiveness in enforcing cybersecurity for IoT networks, by providing
scalable, efficient solutions for the real-time analysis of encrypted traffic
within strict hardware limitations.

Result: 发现AI代理的需求是质变而非量变，混合方案（集中式注册与联邦式网络结合）可能是最佳选择。

Abstract: The emerging Internet of AI Agents challenges existing web infrastructure
designed for human-scale, reactive interactions. Unlike traditional web
resources, autonomous AI agents initiate actions, maintain persistent state,
spawn sub-agents, and negotiate directly with peers: demanding
millisecond-level discovery, instant credential revocation, and cryptographic
behavioral proofs that exceed current DNS/PKI capabilities. This paper analyzes
whether to upgrade existing infrastructure or implement purpose-built registry
architectures for autonomous agents. We identify critical failure points: DNS
propagation (24-48 hours vs. required milliseconds), certificate revocation
unable to scale to trillions of entities, and IPv4/IPv6 addressing inadequate
for agent-scale routing. We evaluate three approaches: (1) Upgrade paths, (2)
Switch options, (3) Hybrid registries. Drawing parallels to dialup-to-broadband
transitions, we find that agent requirements constitute qualitative, and not
incremental, changes. While upgrades offer compatibility and faster deployment,
clean-slate solutions provide better performance but require longer for
adoption. Our analysis suggests hybrid approaches will emerge, with centralized
registries for critical agents and federated meshes for specialized use cases.

TL;DR: AA-2DGS是一种改进的2D高斯泼溅方法，解决了原方法在不同采样率下的锯齿问题，提升了渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2D高斯泼溅在视图合成和表面重建中表现优异，但在不同采样率下会出现严重锯齿，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 引入世界空间平滑核约束频率内容，并推导出对象空间Mip滤波器，直接在局部空间应用抗锯齿。

Result: AA-2DGS显著提升了渲染质量，消除了高频率锯齿问题。

Conclusion: AA-2DGS在保持几何优势的同时，解决了原方法的锯齿问题，扩展了其应用场景。

Abstract: 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has recently emerged as a promising method for
novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction, offering better
view-consistency and geometric accuracy than volumetric 3DGS. However, 2DGS
suffers from severe aliasing artifacts when rendering at different sampling
rates than those used during training, limiting its practical applications in
scenarios requiring camera zoom or varying fields of view. We identify that
these artifacts stem from two key limitations: the lack of frequency
constraints in the representation and an ineffective screen-space clamping
approach. To address these issues, we present AA-2DGS, an antialiased
formulation of 2D Gaussian Splatting that maintains its geometric benefits
while significantly enhancing rendering quality across different scales. Our
method introduces a world space flat smoothing kernel that constrains the
frequency content of 2D Gaussian primitives based on the maximal sampling
frequency from training views, effectively eliminating high-frequency artifacts
when zooming in. Additionally, we derive a novel object space Mip filter by
leveraging an affine approximation of the ray-splat intersection mapping, which
allows us to efficiently apply proper anti-aliasing directly in the local space
of each splat.

Result: 现有全参考质量度量在这些失真上表现不佳（最大Pearson相关系数为0.78），而CGVQM显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CGVQM在合成内容质量评估中表现优异，数据集和度量方法已开源。

Abstract: While existing video and image quality datasets have extensively studied
natural videos and traditional distortions, the perception of synthetic content
and modern rendering artifacts remains underexplored. We present a novel video
quality dataset focused on distortions introduced by advanced rendering
techniques, including neural supersampling, novel-view synthesis, path tracing,
neural denoising, frame interpolation, and variable rate shading. Our
evaluations show that existing full-reference quality metrics perform
sub-optimally on these distortions, with a maximum Pearson correlation of 0.78.
Additionally, we find that the feature space of pre-trained 3D CNNs aligns
strongly with human perception of visual quality. We propose CGVQM, a
full-reference video quality metric that significantly outperforms existing
metrics while generating both per-pixel error maps and global quality scores.

Abstract: Advances in sensor technology and automation have ushered in an era of data
abundance, where the ability to identify and extract relevant information in
real time has become increasingly critical. Traditional filtering approaches,
which depend on a priori knowledge, often struggle to adapt to dynamic or
unanticipated data features. Machine learning offers a compelling
alternative-particularly when training can occur directly at or near the
detector. This paper presents a digital hardware architecture designed for
real-time neural network training, specifically optimized for high-throughput
data ingestion. The design is described in an implementation-independent
manner, with detailed analysis of each architectural component and their
performance implications. Through system parameterization, the study explores
trade-offs between processing speed, model complexity, and hardware resource
utilization. Practical examples illustrate how these parameters affect
applicability across various use cases. A proof-of-concept implementation on an
FPGA demonstrates in-situ training, confirming that computational accuracy is
preserved relative to conventional software-based approaches. Moreover,
resource estimates indicate that current-generation FPGAs can train networks of
approximately 3,500 neurons per chip. The architecture is both scalable and
adaptable, representing a significant advancement toward integrating learning
directly within detector systems and enabling a new class of extreme-edge,
real-time information processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI的高能耗引发广泛讨论，但缺乏科学证据支持FtS在减少碳足迹方面的优势。

Method: 在部分合成场景中，比较了四种AI算法在异常检测领域的碳排放差异，包括无策略、FtS及两种现有策略。

Result: FtS策略平均减少14.6%的碳排放（峰值16.3%），同时保持训练时间。

Conclusion: FtS是一种有效的减少AI工作负载碳足迹的策略。

Abstract: 'Follow-the-Sun' (FtS) is a theoretical computational model aimed at
minimizing the carbon footprint of computer workloads. It involves dynamically
moving workloads to regions with cleaner energy sources as demand increases and
energy production relies more on fossil fuels. With the significant power
consumption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) being a subject of extensive
debate, FtS is proposed as a strategy to mitigate the carbon footprint of
training AI models. However, the literature lacks scientific evidence on the
advantages of FtS to mitigate the carbon footprint of AI workloads. In this
paper, we present the results of an experiment conducted in a partial synthetic
scenario to address this research gap. We benchmarked four AI algorithms in the
anomaly detection domain and measured the differences in carbon emissions in
four cases: no strategy, FtS, and two strategies previously introduced in the
state of the art, namely Flexible Start and Pause and Resume. To conduct our
experiment, we utilized historical carbon intensity data from the year 2021 for
seven European cities. Our results demonstrate that the FtS strategy not only
achieves average reductions of up to 14.6% in carbon emissions (with peaks of
16.3%) but also helps in preserving the time needed for training.

Result: 在真实后端系统中验证了50%以上的测试需求，成本仅为每API 2.19美元。

Conclusion: 该方法为可扩展的AI驱动软件测试提供了方向，有望显著提升工程效率。

Abstract: Software testing plays a critical role in ensuring that systems behave as
intended. However, existing automated testing approaches struggle to match the
capabilities of human engineers due to key limitations such as test locality,
lack of general reliability, and business logic blindness. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that leverages functional programming and type
systems to translate Scala backend code into formal Lean representations. Our
pipeline automatically generates theorems that specify the intended behavior of
APIs and database operations, and uses LLM-based provers to verify them. When a
theorem is proved, the corresponding logic is guaranteed to be correct and no
further testing is needed. If the negation of a theorem is proved instead, it
confirms a bug. In cases where neither can be proved, human intervention is
required. We evaluate our method on realistic backend systems and find that it
can formally verify over 50% of the test requirements, which suggests that half
of a testing engineer's workload can be automated. Additionally, with an
average cost of only $2.19 per API, LLM-based verification is significantly
more cost-effective than manual testing and can be scaled easily through
parallel execution. Our results indicate a promising direction for scalable,
AI-powered software testing, with the potential to greatly improve engineering
productivity as models continue to advance.

Conclusion: 该框架有效验证了代码转换的语义等价性，并支持修复和模型优化。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) based Generative AI techniques
have made it feasible to translate enterpriselevel code from legacy languages
such as COBOL to modern languages such as Java or Python. While the results of
LLM-based automatic transformation are encouraging, the resulting code cannot
be trusted to correctly translate the original code. We propose a framework and
a tool to help validate the equivalence of COBOL and translated Java. The
results can also help repair the code if there are some issues and provide
feedback to the AI model to improve. We have developed a
symbolic-execution-based test generation to automatically generate unit tests
for the source COBOL programs which also mocks the external resource calls. We
generate equivalent JUnit test cases with equivalent mocking as COBOL and run
them to check semantic equivalence between original and translated programs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的AI准备框架，用于评估军事系统中AI组件的成熟度和可信度，以弥补现有技术准备评估的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的技术准备评估未能涵盖AI特有的关键因素，可能导致部署风险。

Method: 提出了一种类似传统技术准备水平（TRL）但针对AI扩展的框架，结合现有数据评估工具和测试实践。

Result: 框架展示了近期实施的可行性，为决策者提供了更清晰的AI系统性能、透明度和人机整合标准。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于提升国防技术管理和风险评估，确保AI系统在军事应用中的可靠性和安全性。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionize military combat
systems, but ensuring these AI-enabled capabilities are truly mission-ready
presents new challenges. We argue that current technology readiness assessments
fail to capture critical AI-specific factors, leading to potential risks in
deployment. We propose a new AI Readiness Framework to evaluate the maturity
and trustworthiness of AI components in military systems. The central thesis is
that a tailored framework - analogous to traditional Technology Readiness
Levels (TRL) but expanded for AI - can better gauge an AI system's reliability,
safety, and suitability for combat use. Using current data evaluation tools and
testing practices, we demonstrate the framework's feasibility for near-term
implementation. This structured approach provides military decision-makers with
clearer insight into whether an AI-enabled system has met the necessary
standards of performance, transparency, and human integration to be deployed
with confidence, thus advancing the field of defense technology management and
risk assessment.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了EmbedAgent范式和Embedbench基准，用于评估LLMs在嵌入式系统开发中的能力，发现其表现参差不齐，并提出两种改进策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准未能全面评估LLMs在嵌入式系统开发中的能力，特别是在连接数字与物理系统的任务中。

Method: 提出EmbedAgent范式和Embedbench基准，包含126个案例，覆盖9种电子组件和3种硬件平台，测试10种主流LLMs。

Result: LLMs表现差异显著，DeepSeek-R1在提供原理图时通过率为55.6%，生成原理图时为50.0%；在跨平台迁移任务中，MicroPython表现较好（73.8%），ESP-IDF较差（29.4%）。

Conclusion: 通过检索增强生成和编译器反馈策略，显著提升了LLMs的性能，例如DeepSeek-R1通过率提升至65.1%。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in various tasks, yet few
benchmarks assess their capabilities in embedded system development.In this
paper, we introduce EmbedAgent, a paradigm designed to simulate real-world
roles in embedded system development, such as Embedded System Programmer,
Architect, and Integrator. This paradigm enables LLMs to be tested in tasks
that bridge the gap between digital and physical systems, allowing for a more
comprehensive assessment of their capabilities. To evaluate LLMs on these
tasks, we propose Embedbench, the first comprehensive benchmark for embedded
system programming, circuit design, and cross-platform migration.Embedbench
consists of 126 cases, covering 9 electronic components across 3 hardware
platforms. Through extensive experiments on 10 mainstream LLMs, we uncover
several key findings. Surprisingly, despite the simplicity of the cases,
DeepSeek-R1 achieves only a 55.6% pass@1 rate when provided with schematic
information, and 50.0% when tasked with generating the schematics itself. In
the cross-platform migration tasks, LLMs show relatively strong performance
with MicroPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico (with the top model achieving 73.8%
pass@1), but perform poorly on ESP-IDF, where the best model reaches only 29.4%
pass@1.Interestingly, we observe that general-purpose chat LLMs like
DeepSeek-V3 often fail to utilize relevant pre-trained knowledge in this
domain, while reasoning LLMs tend to overthink and overlook efficient knowledge
during pretraining. Based on these insights, we propose two strategies:
retrieval augmented generation and compiler feedback-to enhance LLM
performance. These strategies result in significant improvements, with
Deepseek-R1 reaching a 65.1% pass@1 with correct schematics, and 53.1% without.
Additionally, the accuracy of the Arduino to ESP32 migration task improves from
21.4% to 27.8%.

Motivation: LLMs在软件工程任务中表现优异，但对遗留语言的理解能力尚不明确，尤其是缺乏或不准确的文档可能影响其理解。

Method: 采用多选问答（MCQA）方法，定量评估LLMs对遗留代码的理解能力，并分析文档的影响。

Result: 初步发现文档的存在和准确性对LLM理解遗留代码有显著影响。

Conclusion: 未来工作将围绕优化LLM对遗留代码的理解展开，并进一步验证文档的作用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly integrated into software
engineering and maintenance tasks due to their high performance with software
engineering tasks and robust understanding of modern programming languages.
However, the ability of LLMs to comprehend code written with legacy languages
remains a research gap challenged by real-world legacy systems lacking or
containing inaccurate documentation that may impact LLM comprehension. To
assess LLM comprehension of legacy languages, there is a need for objective LLM
evaluation. In order to objectively measure LLM comprehension of legacy
languages, we need an efficient, quantitative evaluation method. We leverage
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), an emerging LLM evaluation
methodology, to evaluate LLM comprehension of legacy code and the impact of
comment prevalence and inaccurate comments. In this work, we present
preliminary findings on the impact of documentation on LLM comprehension of
legacy code and outline strategic objectives for future work.

*Chaitanya Ravuri,Saman Amarasinghe*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为功能聚类的黑盒包装方法，通过采样和测试消除代码生成LLM中的幻觉错误，提供可调置信度分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代代码生成LLM虽能解决大量编程问题，但仍存在细微错误，导致输出不可靠。

Method: 通过采样多个候选程序，执行自生成测试套件，并聚类I/O行为相同的候选程序，以最大聚类的经验质量作为置信度估计。

Result: 在LiveCodeBench上，该方法将错误率从65%降至2%，保守阈值下可降至0%，同时保留15.6%的提示回答率。

Conclusion: 功能聚类为依赖自主代码生成提供了实用路径，未来工作可集中于规范清晰度。

Abstract: Modern code-generation LLMs can already solve a large fraction of programming
problems, yet they still hallucinate subtle bugs that make their outputs unsafe
for autonomous deployment. We present functional clustering, a black-box
wrapper that eliminates nearly all hallucination-induced errors while providing
a tunable confidence score. The wrapper samples many candidate programs,
executes each on a self-generated test suite, and clusters candidates whose I/O
behavior is identical; the empirical mass of the largest cluster serves as an
exact confidence estimate. A single scalar threshold on this estimate lets
users trade coverage for reliability with exponential guarantees. On
LiveCodeBench our verifier preserves baseline pass@1 on solvable tasks yet
slashes the error rate of returned answers from ~65% to 2%, and drives it to 0%
at a conservative threshold while still answering 15.6% of prompts. Manual
audits show that the few residual mistakes stem from prompt misinterpretation,
not random generation noise, narrowing future work to specification clarity.
Because the method requires only sampling and sandbox execution, it applies
unchanged to closed-source APIs and future models, offering a practical path
toward dependable, autonomous code generation. Our code is available on Github
(https://github.com/20ChaituR/functional-clustering).

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过LLM迭代反馈生成的代码中，安全漏洞显著增加，挑战了迭代改进提升代码安全的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM迭代反馈对代码安全性的影响，填补相关研究空白。

Method: 通过40轮实验，分析400个代码样本在不同提示策略下的安全漏洞变化。

Result: 仅5次迭代后，关键漏洞增加37.6%，不同提示策略产生独特漏洞模式。

Conclusion: 需结合人类专家验证以降低风险，并提出实用开发指南。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models(LLMs) for code generation has
transformed software development, yet little attention has been given to how
security vulnerabilities evolve through iterative LLM feedback. This paper
analyzes security degradation in AI-generated code through a controlled
experiment with 400 code samples across 40 rounds of "improvements" using four
distinct prompting strategies. Our findings show a 37.6% increase in critical
vulnerabilities after just five iterations, with distinct vulnerability
patterns emerging across different prompting approaches. This evidence
challenges the assumption that iterative LLM refinement improves code security
and highlights the essential role of human expertise in the loop. We propose
practical guidelines for developers to mitigate these risks, emphasizing the
need for robust human validation between LLM iterations to prevent the
paradoxical introduction of new security issues during supposedly beneficial
code "improvements".

Motivation: 随着代码代理在解决独立编程问题上的准确性提高，如何将其重构为可重用组件成为挑战，研究旨在探索代码代理在这方面的能力。

Method: 提出了Librarian方法（一种采样和重排序方法）和Minicode基准，用于生成可重用库和评估代码代理的重构能力。

Result: Librarian在Minicode基准上表现出色，压缩率比现有代码代理高1.6-2倍，同时提高了正确性。

Conclusion: Librarian和Minicode为代码代理的重构能力提供了有效方法和评估标准，相关代码和基准已开源。

Abstract: Maintainable and general software allows developers to build robust
applications efficiently, yet achieving these qualities often requires
refactoring specialized solutions into reusable components. This challenge
becomes particularly relevant as code agents become increasingly accurate at
solving isolated programming problems. We investigate code agents' capacity to
refactor code in ways supporting growth and reusability. We present both a
method and a benchmark for refactoring: Librarian, a sample-and-rerank method
for generating reusable libraries, and Minicode, a benchmark where code agents
must minimize and refactor multiple independent solutions into a joint library.
Compared to state-of-the-art code agents, Librarian achieves strong results on
both compression and correctness on Minicode, obtaining compression rates
1.6-2x better than coding agents while also improving correctness. We
open-source our code and benchmark at https://code-refactor.github.io/.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Code Researcher的深度研究代理，用于为系统代码生成补丁，显著优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统代码的复杂性和规模使得修改困难，需要深入研究代码库和提交历史。

Method: Code Researcher通过多步推理分析代码语义、模式和提交历史，并将上下文存储在结构化内存中以合成补丁。

Result: 在Linux内核崩溃基准测试中，Code Researcher的崩溃解决率为58%，优于SWE-agent的37.5%。

Conclusion: 全局上下文收集和多方面推理对大型代码库至关重要，Code Researcher展示了其通用性和高效性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based coding agents have shown promising results
on coding benchmarks, but their effectiveness on systems code remains
underexplored. Due to the size and complexities of systems code, making changes
to a systems codebase is a daunting task, even for humans. It requires
researching about many pieces of context, derived from the large codebase and
its massive commit history, before making changes. Inspired by the recent
progress on deep research agents, we design the first deep research agent for
code, called Code Researcher, and apply it to the problem of generating patches
for mitigating crashes reported in systems code. Code Researcher performs
multi-step reasoning about semantics, patterns, and commit history of code to
gather sufficient context. The context is stored in a structured memory which
is used for synthesizing a patch. We evaluate Code Researcher on kBenchSyz, a
benchmark of Linux kernel crashes, and show that it significantly outperforms
strong baselines, achieving a crash-resolution rate of 58%, compared to 37.5%
by SWE-agent. On an average, Code Researcher explores 10 files in each
trajectory whereas SWE-agent explores only 1.33 files, highlighting Code
Researcher's ability to deeply explore the codebase. Through another experiment
on an open-source multimedia software, we show the generalizability of Code
Researcher. Our experiments highlight the importance of global context
gathering and multi-faceted reasoning for large codebases.

TL;DR: CoQuIR是一个多语言、大规模的质量感知代码检索基准，评估了23个模型在正确性、效率、安全性和可维护性四个维度的表现，发现现有模型在区分代码质量方面存在不足，并提出了改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码检索基准主要关注功能相关性，忽视了软件质量的关键维度，因此需要引入质量感知的评估标准。

Method: 开发了CoQuIR基准，包含42,725个查询和134,907个代码片段的质量标注，并提出了两种质量中心评估指标。对23个模型进行了测试，并研究了改进训练方法。

Result: 现有模型在区分代码质量方面表现不佳，但通过合成数据集的训练方法可以显著提升质量感知指标，同时保持语义相关性。

Conclusion: 将质量信号整合到代码检索系统中对开发更可靠的软件工具至关重要。

Abstract: Code retrieval is essential in modern software development, as it boosts code
reuse and accelerates debugging. However, current benchmarks primarily
emphasize functional relevance while neglecting critical dimensions of software
quality. Motivated by this gap, we introduce CoQuIR, the first large-scale,
multilingual benchmark specifically designed to evaluate quality-aware code
retrieval across four key dimensions: correctness, efficiency, security, and
maintainability. CoQuIR provides fine-grained quality annotations for 42,725
queries and 134,907 code snippets in 11 programming languages, and is
accompanied by two quality-centric evaluation metrics: Pairwise Preference
Accuracy and Margin-based Ranking Score. Using CoQuIR, we benchmark 23
retrieval models, covering both open-source and proprietary systems, and find
that even top-performing models frequently fail to distinguish buggy or
insecure code from their more robust counterparts. Furthermore, we conduct
preliminary investigations into training methods that explicitly encourage
retrievers to recognize code quality. Using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate
promising improvements in quality-aware metrics across various models, without
sacrificing semantic relevance. Downstream code generation experiments further
validate the effectiveness of our approach. Overall, our work highlights the
importance of integrating quality signals into code retrieval systems, laying
the groundwork for more trustworthy and robust software development tools.

declarations. LeanExplore enables users to semantically search for statements,
both formally and informally, across select Lean 4 packages (including
Batteries, Init, Lean, Mathlib, PhysLean, and Std). This search capability is
powered by a hybrid ranking strategy, integrating scores from a multi-source
semantic embedding model (capturing conceptual meaning from formal Lean code,
docstrings, AI-generated informal translations, and declaration titles), BM25+
for keyword-based lexical relevance, and a PageRank-based score reflecting
declaration importance and interconnectedness. The search engine is accessible
via a dedicated website (https://www.leanexplore.com/) and a Python API
(https://github.com/justincasher/lean-explore). Furthermore, the database can
be downloaded, allowing users to self-host the service. LeanExplore integrates
easily with LLMs via the model context protocol (MCP), enabling users to chat
with an AI assistant about Lean declarations or utilize the search engine for
building theorem-proving agents. This work details LeanExplore's architecture,

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Coda是一个基于代码图的调适适配器，用于增强现有编程知识跟踪（PKT）模型，通过识别和减少噪声信号的影响，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前PKT研究主要关注代码内容与知识评估的隐式关系，但忽略了长期编程活动中的噪声信号（无关提交和微小修改），这限制了模型性能和应用。

Method: Coda将松散代码序列转换为紧凑代码图，通过语义相似性识别无关信号，并利用聚类感知GCN增强弱信号的区分和聚类。最后，通过优化噪声特征约束和导航正则化项，校正噪声影响。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，Coda在噪声编程记录下有效执行PKT任务，性能优于典型基线。

Conclusion: Coda是一个模型无关的框架，可适配大多数现有PKT解决方案，有效解决了噪声信号问题。

Abstract: Programming Knowledge Tracking (PKT) aims to dynamically diagnose learners'
mastery levels of programming knowledge based on their coding activities,
facilitating more effective and personalized programming education. However,
current PKT studies primarily focus on the implicit relationship between code
content and knowledge assessment, often overlooking two types of noise signals
in long-term programming activities: unwanted signals from unrelated
submissions and weak signals from minor modifications. This practical challenge
significantly limits model performance and application. To address this issue,
we propose Coda, a Code graph-based tuning adaptor designed to enhance existing
PKT models by identifying and mitigating the impact of noise. Specifically,
Coda first transforms the loose code sequences submitted by each learner into a
compact code graph. By leveraging this code graph, unwanted signals can be
identified from a semantic similarity perspective. We then apply a
cluster-aware GCN to the code graph, which improves the discrimination of weak
signals and enables their clustering for identification. Finally, a lightweight
yet effective adaptor is incorporated into the PKT task through optimization
with two noise feature-based constraints and a navigational regularization
term, to correct knowledge states affected by noise. It is worth mentioning
that the Coda framework is model-agnostic and can be adapted to most existing
PKT solutions. Extensive experimental results on four real-world datasets
demonstrate that Coda effectively performs the PKT task in the presence of
noisy programming records, outperforming typical baselines.

Motivation: 现有基准测试在编程语言覆盖和生成模型能力上不足，无法满足现实需求，因此需要更全面的基准。

Method: CodeMirage通过覆盖10种编程语言、包含原始和改写代码样本，以及整合10种先进LLM的输出，构建了一个全面的基准。

Result: 评估了10种检测器，揭示了9项关键发现，展示了当前检测器的优缺点。

Conclusion: CodeMirage为开发鲁棒且通用的AI生成代码检测器提供了实用且严谨的测试平台。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become integral to modern software
development, producing vast amounts of AI-generated source code. While these
models boost programming productivity, their misuse introduces critical risks,
including code plagiarism, license violations, and the propagation of insecure
programs. As a result, robust detection of AI-generated code is essential. To
support the development of such detectors, a comprehensive benchmark that
reflects real-world conditions is crucial. However, existing benchmarks fall
short -- most cover only a limited set of programming languages and rely on
less capable generative models. In this paper, we present CodeMirage, a
comprehensive benchmark that addresses these limitations through three major
advancements: (1) it spans ten widely used programming languages, (2) includes
both original and paraphrased code samples, and (3) incorporates outputs from
ten state-of-the-art production-level LLMs, including both reasoning and
non-reasoning models from six major providers. Using CodeMirage, we evaluate
ten representative detectors across four methodological paradigms under four
realistic evaluation configurations, reporting results using three
complementary metrics. Our analysis reveals nine key findings that uncover the
strengths and weaknesses of current detectors, and identify critical challenges
for future work. We believe CodeMirage offers a rigorous and practical testbed
to advance the development of robust and generalizable AI-generated code
detectors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在IT自动化中，自动评估和选择最佳模型以改进代码质量是关键。传统方法（如表面相似性度量）和执行评估各有局限，因此需要更高效的自动化评估方法。

Method: 采用LLM-as-a-Judge方法，结合双向功能匹配和逻辑表示，对Bash代码生成进行无参考验证和优化。以执行评估为基准验证其效果。

Result: LLM-as-a-Judge与执行评估高度一致（准确率提升8%），代码优化代理进一步提升了24%的准确性。

Conclusion: LLM-as-a-Judge方法在自动代码验证和优化中表现优异，为IT自动化中的事件修复提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In an effort to automatically evaluate and select the best model and improve
code quality for automatic incident remediation in IT Automation, it is crucial
to verify if the generated code for remediation action is syntactically and
semantically correct and whether it can be executed correctly as intended.
There are three approaches: 1) conventional methods use surface form similarity
metrics (token match, exact match, etc.) which have numerous limitations, 2)
execution-based evaluation focuses more on code functionality based on
pass/fail judgments for given test-cases, and 3) LLM-as-a-Judge employs LLMs
for automated evaluation to judge if it is a correct answer for a given problem
based on pre-defined metrics. In this work, we focused on enhancing
LLM-as-a-Judge using bidirectional functionality matching and logic
representation for reference-less automatic validation and refinement for Bash
code generation to select the best model for automatic incident remediation in
IT Automation. We used execution-based evaluation as ground-truth to evaluate
our LLM-as-a-Judge metrics. Results show high accuracy and agreement with
execution-based evaluation (and up to 8% over baseline). Finally, we built
Reflection code agents to utilize judgments and feedback from our evaluation
metrics which achieved significant improvement (up to 24% increase in accuracy)
for automatic code refinement.

Conclusion: YOTO为漏洞检测提供了一种高效且资源友好的解决方案。

Abstract: With the pervasive integration of computer applications across industries,
the presence of vulnerabilities within code bases poses significant risks. The
diversity of software ecosystems coupled with the intricate nature of modern
software engineering has led to a shift from manual code vulnerability
identification towards the adoption of automated tools. Among these, deep
learning-based approaches have risen to prominence due to their superior
accuracy; however, these methodologies encounter several obstacles. Primarily,
they necessitate extensive labeled datasets and prolonged training periods, and
given the rapid emergence of new vulnerabilities, the frequent retraining of
models becomes a resource-intensive endeavor, thereby limiting their
applicability in cutting-edge scenarios. To mitigate these challenges, this
paper introduces the \underline{\textbf{YOTO}}--\underline{\textbf{Y}}ou
\underline{\textbf{O}}nly \underline{\textbf{T}}rain \underline{\textbf{O}}nce
framework. This innovative approach facilitates the integration of multiple
types of vulnerability detection models via parameter fusion, eliminating the
need for joint training. Consequently, YOTO enables swift adaptation to newly
discovered vulnerabilities, significantly reducing both the time and
computational resources required for model updates.

Method: 采用MCP标准化接口，使LLM能直接调用系统功能，并在实验室规模的制造系统中进行原型评估。

Result: 实验表明，该方法无需显式语义模型即可实现灵活的工业自动化。

Conclusion: 为LLM驱动的生产系统中外部工具集成提供了进一步探索的基础。

Abstract: Explicit modeling of capabilities and skills -- whether based on ontologies,
Asset Administration Shells, or other technologies -- requires considerable
manual effort and often results in representations that are not easily
accessible to Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work-in-progress paper, we
present an alternative approach based on the recently introduced Model Context
Protocol (MCP). MCP allows systems to expose functionality through a
standardized interface that is directly consumable by LLM-based agents. We
conduct a prototypical evaluation on a laboratory-scale manufacturing system,
where resource functions are made available via MCP. A general-purpose LLM is
then tasked with planning and executing a multi-step process, including
constraint handling and the invocation of resource functions via MCP. The
results indicate that such an approach can enable flexible industrial
automation without relying on explicit semantic models. This work lays the
basis for further exploration of external tool integration in LLM-driven
production systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种从NL2SQL数据集自动生成NL2API数据集的方法，并评估了10种大型语言模型在API调用任务中的表现，发现其任务完成率较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业部署中，大型语言模型需要与复杂API集合交互，但缺乏相关数据集。研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用SQL查询语法构建功能等效的API调用序列，生成NL2API数据集，并评估模型性能。

Result: 模型在API调用任务中表现不佳，任务完成率仅为7-47%，改进后也仅达50%。

Conclusion: 当前工具调用型LLM仍有较大改进空间，尤其是在意图检测和嵌套函数调用方面。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are routinely deployed as agentic systems, with
access to tools that interact with live environments to accomplish tasks. In
enterprise deployments these systems need to interact with API collections that
can be extremely large and complex, often backed by databases. In order to
create datasets with such characteristics, we explore how existing NL2SQL
(Natural Language to SQL query) datasets can be used to automatically create
NL2API datasets. Specifically, this work describes a novel data generation
pipeline that exploits the syntax of SQL queries to construct a functionally
equivalent sequence of API calls. We apply this pipeline to one of the largest
NL2SQL datasets, BIRD-SQL to create a collection of over 2500 APIs that can be
served as invocable tools or REST-endpoints. We pair natural language queries
from BIRD-SQL to ground-truth API sequences based on this API pool. We use this
collection to study the performance of 10 public LLMs and find that all models
struggle to determine the right set of tools (consisting of tasks of intent
detection, sequencing with nested function calls, and slot-filling). We find
that models have extremely low task completion rates (7-47 percent - depending
on the dataset) which marginally improves to 50 percent when models are
employed as ReACT agents that interact with the live API environment. The best
task completion rates are far below what may be required for effective
general-use tool-calling agents, suggesting substantial scope for improvement
in current state-of-the-art tool-calling LLMs. We also conduct detailed
ablation studies, such as assessing the impact of the number of tools available
as well as the impact of tool and slot-name obfuscation. We compare the
performance of models on the original SQL generation tasks and find that
current models are sometimes able to exploit SQL better than APIs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MuSL的互监督学习框架，用于解决序列到并行代码翻译中的功能等价问题，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于并行编程的复杂性，自动化的序列到并行代码翻译需求增加，但数据稀缺和功能等价问题阻碍了机器学习方法的有效性。

Method: MuSL框架包含一个翻译器和一个测试器，通过协同验证和协同进化的迭代循环相互提升。测试器生成单元测试验证翻译代码的功能等价性，翻译器则生成翻译代码作为测试器的增强输入。

Result: 实验显示，MuSL显著提升了基础模型的性能，Pass@1提升28.91%，测试器性能提升68.90%，并在BLEU和CodeBLEU分数上超越之前的最佳方法。

Conclusion: MuSL框架有效解决了功能等价问题，性能接近或超越现有先进模型，为序列到并行代码翻译提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rise of GPU-based high-performance computing (HPC) has driven the
widespread adoption of parallel programming models such as CUDA. Yet, the
inherent complexity of parallel programming creates a demand for the automated
sequential-to-parallel approaches. However, data scarcity poses a significant
challenge for machine learning-based sequential-to-parallel code translation.
Although recent back-translation methods show promise, they still fail to
ensure functional equivalence in the translated code. In this paper, we propose
a novel Mutual-Supervised Learning (MSL) framework for sequential-to-parallel
code translation to address the functional equivalence issue. MSL consists of
two models, a Translator and a Tester. Through an iterative loop consisting of
Co-verify and Co-evolve steps, the Translator and the Tester mutually generate
data for each other and improve collectively. The Tester generates unit tests
to verify and filter functionally equivalent translated code, thereby evolving
the Translator, while the Translator generates translated code as augmented
input to evolve the Tester. Experimental results demonstrate that MuSL
significantly enhances the performance of the base model: when applied to
Qwen2.5-Coder, it not only improves Pass@1 by up to 28.91% and boosts Tester
performance by 68.90%, but also outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
method CodeRosetta by 1.56 and 6.92 in BLEU and CodeBLEU scores, while
achieving performance comparable to DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.1. Our code is
available at https://github.com/kcxain/musl.

Motivation: 重新评估LLMs在竞赛编程中的表现，对比人类专家，揭示其局限性。

Method: 引入LiveCodeBench Pro基准，由国际竞赛奖牌得主标注问题并分析模型失败提交。

Result: 前沿模型在中等难度问题中仅53%通过率，困难问题0%，依赖工具而非推理能力。

Conclusion: LLMs在实现精度上表现良好，但在复杂推理上仍有显著差距，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Recent reports claim that large language models (LLMs) now outperform elite
humans in competitive programming. Drawing on knowledge from a group of
medalists in international algorithmic contests, we revisit this claim,
examining how LLMs differ from human experts and where limitations still
remain. We introduce LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark composed of problems from
Codeforces, ICPC, and IOI that are continuously updated to reduce the
likelihood of data contamination. A team of Olympiad medalists annotates every
problem for algorithmic categories and conducts a line-by-line analysis of
failed model-generated submissions. Using this new data and benchmark, we find
that frontier models still have significant limitations: without external
tools, the best model achieves only 53% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems
and 0% on hard problems, domains where expert humans still excel. We also find
that LLMs succeed at implementation-heavy problems but struggle with nuanced
algorithmic reasoning and complex case analysis, often generating confidently
incorrect justifications. High performance appears largely driven by
implementation precision and tool augmentation, not superior reasoning.
LiveCodeBench Pro thus highlights the significant gap to human grandmaster
levels, while offering fine-grained diagnostics to steer future improvements in
code-centric LLM reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏真实环境的验证信号和显式优化，导致自验证不可靠。

Method: ReVeal框架通过生成测试用例、调用外部工具反馈，并利用密集奖励的RL算法优化性能。

Result: 在LiveCodeBench上Pass@k显著提升，推理时代码随轮次增加持续优化，超越DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B。

Conclusion: ReVeal为构建更鲁棒自主的AI代理提供了可扩展有效的方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable outcome
rewards have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), especially when combined with multi-turn tool
interactions. However, existing methods lack both meaningful verification
signals from realistic environments and explicit optimization for verification,
leading to unreliable self-verification. To address these limitations, we
propose ReVeal, a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that interleaves
code generation with explicit self-verification and tool-based evaluation.
ReVeal enables LLMs to autonomously generate test cases, invoke external tools
for precise feedback, and improves performance via a customized RL algorithm
with dense, per-turn rewards. As a result, ReVeal fosters the co-evolution of a
model's generation and verification capabilities through RL training, expanding
the reasoning boundaries of the base model, demonstrated by significant gains
in Pass@k on LiveCodeBench. It also enables test-time scaling into deeper
inference regimes, with code consistently evolving as the number of turns
increases during inference, ultimately surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B.
These findings highlight the promise of ReVeal as a scalable and effective
paradigm for building more robust and autonomous AI agents.

### [368] [Leveraging GPT-4 for Vulnerability-Witnessing Unit Test Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11559)
*Gábor Antal,Dénes Bán,Martin Isztin,Rudolf Ferenc,Péter Hegedűs*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文探讨了GPT-4在自动生成单元测试方面的能力，特别是在漏洞修复的背景下，发现其能生成语法正确的测试用例，但语义正确性验证有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件测试在质量保障中至关重要，但手动创建测试复杂且耗时。研究旨在探索GPT-4是否能自动生成漏洞相关的单元测试。

Method: 使用VUL4J数据集中的真实漏洞及其修复代码，评估GPT-4生成测试用例的能力，关注代码上下文、自校正能力和测试用例的实用性。

Result: GPT-4能生成66.5%语法正确的测试用例，但仅7.5%的语义正确性可自动验证。主观评估显示其生成的测试模板可进一步开发。

Conclusion: GPT-4在生成漏洞见证测试中具有潜力，虽不完全自主，但在部分自动化过程中作用显著。

Abstract: In the life-cycle of software development, testing plays a crucial role in
quality assurance. Proper testing not only increases code coverage and prevents
regressions but it can also ensure that any potential vulnerabilities in the
software are identified and effectively fixed. However, creating such tests is
a complex, resource-consuming manual process. To help developers and security
experts, this paper explores the automatic unit test generation capability of
one of the most widely used large language models, GPT-4, from the perspective
of vulnerabilities. We examine a subset of the VUL4J dataset containing real
vulnerabilities and their corresponding fixes to determine whether GPT-4 can
generate syntactically and/or semantically correct unit tests based on the code
before and after the fixes as evidence of vulnerability mitigation. We focus on
the impact of code contexts, the effectiveness of GPT-4's self-correction
ability, and the subjective usability of the generated test cases. Our results
indicate that GPT-4 can generate syntactically correct test cases 66.5\% of the
time without domain-specific pre-training. Although the semantic correctness of
the fixes could be automatically validated in only 7. 5\% of the cases, our
subjective evaluation shows that GPT-4 generally produces test templates that
can be further developed into fully functional vulnerability-witnessing tests
with relatively minimal manual effort.
  Therefore, despite the limited data, our initial findings suggest that GPT-4
can be effectively used in the generation of vulnerability-witnessing tests. It
may not operate entirely autonomously, but it certainly plays a significant
role in a partially automated process.

Motivation: 研究GPT-4o在自动化漏洞修复（AVR）中的表现，探索不同上下文信息对修复能力的影响。

Method: 使用Vul4J数据集，比较GPT-4o和GPT-4的性能，测试9种不同提示策略（含CWE/CVE信息和代码上下文），每种提示运行3次。

Result: GPT-4o平均表现比GPT-4差11.9%，但能修复更多独特漏洞（+10.5%）。CVE信息显著提升修复率，最佳策略结合CVE和代码上下文。

Conclusion: 通过优化提示策略（如Top-3组合），GPT-4o修复率可达62%，优于基线，表明零样本场景下提示策略的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for
automated vulnerability detection and repair in software systems. This paper
investigates the performance of GPT-4o in repairing Java vulnerabilities from a
widely used dataset (Vul4J), exploring how different contextual information
affects automated vulnerability repair (AVR) capabilities. We compare the
latest GPT-4o's performance against previous results with GPT-4 using identical
prompts. We evaluated nine additional prompts crafted by us that contain
various contextual information such as CWE or CVE information, and manually
extracted code contexts. Each prompt was executed three times on 42
vulnerabilities, and the resulting fix candidates were validated using Vul4J's
automated testing framework.
  Our results show that GPT-4o performed 11.9\% worse on average than GPT-4
with the same prompt, but was able to fix 10.5\% more distinct vulnerabilities
in the three runs together. CVE information significantly improved repair
rates, while the length of the task description had minimal impact. Combining
CVE guidance with manually extracted code context resulted in the best
performance. Using our \textsc{Top}-3 prompts together, GPT-4o repaired 26
(62\%) vulnerabilities at least once, outperforming both the original baseline
(40\%) and its reproduction (45\%), suggesting that ensemble prompt strategies
could improve vulnerability repair in zero-shot settings.

Motivation: 现有数值模型在解决声波场问题时存在局限性，PINNs有望通过克服物理维度、源建模和边界条件等挑战提供更优解。

Method: 研究采用PINNs解决Helmholtz方程，通过调整源定义、边界条件集数量和复声速模型来评估收敛行为。

Result: 研究发现每波长至少需要六个训练点才能确保PINN的准确训练和预测。

Conclusion: PINNs在低频室内声学建模中具有潜力，但仍需进一步优化以应对复杂场景。

Abstract: Studying physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for modeling partial
differential equations to solve the acoustic wave field has produced promising
results for simple geometries in two-dimensional domains. One option is to
compute the time-harmonic wave field using the Helmholtz equation. Compared to
existing numerical models, the physics-informed neural networks forward problem
has to overcome several topics related to the convergence of the optimization
toward the "true" solution. The topics reach from considering the physical
dimensionality (from 2D to 3D), the modeling of realistic sources (from a
self-similar source to a realistic confined point source), the modeling of
sound-hard (Neumann) boundary conditions, and the modeling of the full wave
field by considering the complex solution quantities. Within this contribution,
we study 3D room acoustic cases at low frequency, varying the source definition
and the number of boundary condition sets and using a complex speed of sound
model to account for some degree of absorption. We assess the convergence
behavior by looking at the loss landscape of the PINN architecture, the $L^2$
error compared to a finite element reference simulation for each network
architecture and configuration. The convergence studies showed that at least
six training points per wavelength are necessary for accurate training and
subsequent predictions of the PINN. The developments are part of an initiative
aiming to model the low-frequency behavior of room acoustics, including
absorbers.

Abstract: The construction of large-scale, high-quality datasets is a fundamental
prerequisite for developing robust and generalizable foundation models in motor
imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, EEG signals
collected from different subjects and devices are often plagued by low
signal-to-noise ratio, heterogeneity in electrode configurations, and
substantial inter-subject variability, posing significant challenges for
effective model training. In this paper, we propose CLEAN-MI, a scalable and
systematic data construction pipeline for constructing large-scale, efficient,
and accurate neurodata in the MI paradigm. CLEAN-MI integrates frequency band
filtering, channel template selection, subject screening, and marginal
distribution alignment to systematically filter out irrelevant or low-quality
data and standardize multi-source EEG datasets. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of CLEAN-MI on multiple public MI datasets, achieving consistent
improvements in data quality and classification performance.

Method: 通过超高速成像捕捉LIC事件中的气泡半径动态，并利用基于物理模拟数据训练的BDT神经网络分析数据，推断材料粘弹性参数。

Result: BDT能够快速、准确地推断材料参数，无需迭代拟合或复杂反演过程，实现了极端加载条件下的非接触表征。

Conclusion: 该方法为生物医学和材料科学提供了高效、非侵入性的材料表征工具，具有重要应用潜力。

Abstract: Laser-induced inertial cavitation (LIC)-where microscale vapor bubbles
nucleate due to a focused high-energy pulsed laser and then violently collapse
under surrounding high local pressures-offers a unique opportunity to
investigate soft biological material mechanics at extremely high strain rates
(>1000 1/s). Traditional rheological tools are often limited in these regimes
by loading speed, resolution, or invasiveness. Here we introduce novel machine
learning (ML) based microrheological frameworks that leverage LIC to
characterize the viscoelastic properties of biological materials at ultra-high
strain rates. We utilize ultra-high-speed imaging to capture time-resolved
bubble radius dynamics during LIC events in various soft viscoelastic
materials. These bubble radius versus time measurements are then analyzed using
a newly developed Bubble Dynamics Transformer (BDT), a neural network trained
on physics-based simulation data. The BDT accurately infers material
viscoelastic parameters, eliminating the need for iterative fitting or complex
inversion processes. This enables fast, accurate, and non-contact
characterization of soft materials under extreme loading conditions, with
significant implications for biomedical applications and materials science.

Abstract: A central idea in understanding brains and building artificial intelligence
is that structure determines function. Yet, how the brain's complex structure
arises from a limited set of genetic instructions remains a key question. The
ultra high-dimensional detail of neural connections vastly exceeds the
information storage capacity of genes, suggesting a compact, low-dimensional
blueprint must guide brain development. Our motivation is to uncover this
blueprint. We introduce a generative model, to learn this underlying
representation from detailed connectivity maps of mouse cortical microcircuits.
Our model successfully captures the essential structural information of these
circuits in a compressed latent space. We found that specific, interpretable
directions within this space directly relate to understandable network
properties. Building on this, we demonstrate a novel method to controllably
generate new, synthetic microcircuits with desired structural features by
navigating this latent space. This work offers a new way to investigate the
design principles of neural circuits and explore how structure gives rise to
function, potentially informing the development of more advanced artificial
neural networks.

Result: SAE单元与fMRI信号相关性高达0.76，ViT-B/16$_{CLIP}$在早期层利用低级信息生成高级语义信息。

Conclusion: SAE-BrainMap为深度学习模型与人类视觉皮层提供了直接桥梁，提升了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: We present SAE-BrainMap, a novel framework that directly aligns deep learning
visual model representations with voxel-level fMRI responses using sparse
autoencoders (SAEs). First, we train layer-wise SAEs on model activations and
compute the correlations between SAE unit activations and cortical fMRI signals
elicited by the same natural image stimuli with cosine similarity, revealing
strong activation correspondence (maximum similarity up to 0.76). Depending on
this alignment, we construct a voxel dictionary by optimally assigning the most
similar SAE feature to each voxel, demonstrating that SAE units preserve the
functional structure of predefined regions of interest (ROIs) and exhibit
ROI-consistent selectivity. Finally, we establish fine-grained hierarchical
mapping between model layers and the human ventral visual pathway, also by
projecting voxel dictionary activations onto individual cortical surfaces, we
visualize the dynamic transformation of the visual information in deep learning
models. It is found that ViT-B/16$_{CLIP}$ tends to utilize low-level
information to generate high-level semantic information in the early layers and
reconstructs the low-dimension information later. Our results establish a
direct, downstream-task-free bridge between deep neural networks and human
visual cortex, offering new insights into model interpretability.

Abstract: Understanding brain dynamics is important for neuroscience and mental health.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables the measurement of neural
activities through blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which represent
brain states. In this study, we aim to predict future human resting brain
states with fMRI. Due to the 3D voxel-wise spatial organization and temporal
dependencies of the fMRI data, we propose a novel architecture which employs a
4D Shifted Window (Swin) Transformer as encoder to efficiently learn
spatio-temporal information and a convolutional decoder to enable brain state
prediction at the same spatial and temporal resolution as the input fMRI data.
We used 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) for
model training and testing. Our novel model has shown high accuracy when
predicting 7.2s resting-state brain activities based on the prior 23.04s fMRI
time series. The predicted brain states highly resemble BOLD contrast and
dynamics. This work shows promising evidence that the spatiotemporal
organization of the human brain can be learned by a Swin Transformer model, at
high resolution, which provides a potential for reducing the fMRI scan time and
the development of brain-computer interfaces in the future.

Motivation: 通过能量函数的极小值形成“上下文井”，稳定地捕捉标记之间的上下文关系，以增强Transformer模型在序列建模任务中的能力。

Conclusion: 通过能量景观和非线性注意力机制的统一框架，为Transformer模型提供了更强大的建模能力。

Abstract: In this work we propose an energy functional along the lines of Modern
Hopfield Networks (MNH), the stationary points of which correspond to the
attention due to Vaswani et al. [12], thus unifying both frameworks. The minima
of this landscape form "context wells" - stable configurations that encapsulate
the contextual relationships among tokens. A compelling picture emerges: across
$n$ token embeddings an energy landscape is defined whose gradient corresponds
to the attention computation. Non-linear attention mechanisms offer a means to
enhance the capabilities of transformer models for various sequence modeling
tasks by improving the model's understanding of complex relationships, learning
of representations, and overall efficiency and performance. A rough analogy can
be seen via cubic splines which offer a richer representation of non-linear
data where a simpler linear model may be inadequate. This approach can be used
for the introduction of non-linear heads in transformer based models such as
BERT, [6], etc.

Abstract: With the recent rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), the need of
selecting high-quality dataset to improve machine learning models has garnered
increasing attention. However, some part of this topic remains underexplored,
even for simple prediction models. In this work, we study the problem of
developing practical algorithms that select appropriate dataset to minimize
population loss of our prediction model with high probability. Broadly
speaking, we investigate when datasets from different sources can be
effectively merged to enhance the predictive model's performance, and propose a
practical algorithm with theoretical guarantees. By leveraging an oracle
inequality and data-driven estimators, the algorithm reduces population loss
with high probability. Numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in
both standard linear regression and broader machine learning applications. Code

Abstract: Bayesian optimization of function networks (BOFN) is a framework for
optimizing expensive-to-evaluate objective functions structured as networks,
where some nodes' outputs serve as inputs for others. Many real-world
applications, such as manufacturing and drug discovery, involve function
networks with additional properties - nodes that can be evaluated independently
and incur varying costs. A recent BOFN variant, p-KGFN, leverages this
structure and enables cost-aware partial evaluations, selectively querying only
a subset of nodes at each iteration. p-KGFN reduces the number of expensive
objective function evaluations needed but has a large computational overhead:
choosing where to evaluate requires optimizing a nested Monte Carlo-based
acquisition function for each node in the network. To address this, we propose
an accelerated p-KGFN algorithm that reduces computational overhead with only a
modest loss in query efficiency. Key to our approach is generation of
node-specific candidate inputs for each node in the network via one inexpensive
global Monte Carlo simulation. Numerical experiments show that our method
maintains competitive query efficiency while achieving up to a 16x speedup over
the original p-KGFN algorithm.

Conclusion: 通过低保真近似和替代模型，可以有效降低计算成本，同时保持贝叶斯逆问题的准确性。

Abstract: Solving inverse problems in cardiovascular modeling is particularly
challenging due to the high computational cost of running high-fidelity
simulations. In this work, we focus on Bayesian parameter estimation and
explore different methods to reduce the computational cost of sampling from the
posterior distribution by leveraging low-fidelity approximations. A common
approach is to construct a surrogate model for the high-fidelity simulation
itself. Another is to build a surrogate for the discrepancy between high- and
low-fidelity models. This discrepancy, which is often easier to approximate, is
modeled with either a fully connected neural network or a nonlinear
dimensionality reduction technique that enables surrogate construction in a
lower-dimensional space. A third possible approach is to treat the discrepancy
between the high-fidelity and surrogate models as random noise and estimate its
distribution using normalizing flows. This allows us to incorporate the
approximation error into the Bayesian inverse problem by modifying the
likelihood function. We validate five different methods which are variations of
the above on analytical test cases by comparing them to posterior distributions
derived solely from high-fidelity models, assessing both accuracy and
computational cost. Finally, we demonstrate our approaches on two
cardiovascular examples of increasing complexity: a lumped-parameter Windkessel
model and a patient-specific three-dimensional anatomy.

Result: FExD在电缆桥模型的随机地震动响应预测中，表现优于传统DeepONet和扩展DeepONet，具有更高的精度和效率。

Conclusion: FExD为结构动力学的算子学习提供了重要进展，展示了其在复杂时空预测任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal data, which consists of responses or measurements gathered at
different times and positions, is ubiquitous across diverse applications of
civil infrastructure. While SciML methods have made significant progress in
tackling the issue of response prediction for individual time histories,
creating a full spatial-temporal surrogate remains a challenge. This study
proposes a novel variant of deep operator networks (DeepONets), namely the
full-field Extended DeepONet (FExD), to serve as a spatial-temporal surrogate
that provides multi-output response predictions for dynamical systems. The
proposed FExD surrogate model effectively learns the full solution operator
across multiple degrees of freedom by enhancing the expressiveness of the
branch network and expanding the predictive capabilities of the trunk network.
The proposed FExD surrogate is deployed to simultaneously capture the dynamics
at several sensing locations along a testbed model of a cable-stayed bridge
subjected to stochastic ground motions. The ensuing response predictions from
the FExD are comprehensively compared against both a vanilla DeepONet and a
modified spatio-temporal Extended DeepONet. The results demonstrate the
proposed FExD can achieve both superior accuracy and computational efficiency,
representing a significant advancement in operator learning for structural
dynamics applications.

Method: 定义了获取函数解的不精确性度量，并分析了GP-UCB和GP-TS在非精确解下的累积遗憾界。

Result: 在适当条件下，非精确贝叶斯优化算法仍能实现次线性累积遗憾。

Conclusion: 随机网格搜索作为一种计算高效的获取函数求解器，得到了理论和数值验证的支持。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a widely used iterative algorithm for
optimizing black-box functions. Each iteration requires maximizing an
acquisition function, such as the upper confidence bound (UCB) or a sample path
from the Gaussian process (GP) posterior, as in Thompson sampling (TS).
However, finding an exact solution to these maximization problems is often
intractable and computationally expensive. Reflecting such realistic
situations, in this paper, we delve into the effect of inexact maximizers of
the acquisition functions. Defining a measure of inaccuracy in acquisition
solutions, we establish cumulative regret bounds for both GP-UCB and GP-TS
without requiring exact solutions of acquisition function maximization. Our
results show that under appropriate conditions on accumulated inaccuracy,
inexact BO algorithms can still achieve sublinear cumulative regret. Motivated
by such findings, we provide both theoretical justification and numerical
validation for random grid search as an effective and computationally efficient
acquisition function solver.

Conclusion: 加深了对EM算法在过参数化场景下的理解，为实际应用提供了优化策略。

Abstract: We investigate the convergence properties of the EM algorithm when applied to
overspecified Gaussian mixture models -- that is, when the number of components
in the fitted model exceeds that of the true underlying distribution. Focusing
on a structured configuration where the component means are positioned at the
vertices of a regular simplex and the mixture weights satisfy a non-degeneracy
condition, we demonstrate that the population EM algorithm converges
exponentially fast in terms of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance. Our analysis
leverages the strong convexity of the negative log-likelihood function in a
neighborhood around the optimum and utilizes the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz
inequality to establish that an $\epsilon$-accurate approximation is achievable
in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ iterations. Furthermore, we extend these results to a
finite-sample setting by deriving explicit statistical convergence guarantees.
Numerical experiments on synthetic datasets corroborate our theoretical
findings, highlighting the dramatic acceleration in convergence compared to
conventional sublinear rates. This work not only deepens the understanding of
EM's behavior in overspecified settings but also offers practical insights into
initialization strategies and model design for high-dimensional clustering and
density estimation tasks.

Result: PGMs在低维或噪声特征下优于GNNs，且对高异质性图更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PGMs在特定场景下表现更优，但需权衡计算复杂性和可解释性。

Abstract: Graphs are a powerful data structure for representing relational data and are
widely used to describe complex real-world systems. Probabilistic Graphical
Models (PGMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can both leverage
graph-structured data, but their inherent functioning is different. The
question is how do they compare in capturing the information contained in
networked datasets? We address this objective by solving a link prediction task
and we conduct three main experiments, on both synthetic and real networks: one
focuses on how PGMs and GNNs handle input features, while the other two
investigate their robustness to noisy features and increasing heterophily of
the graph. PGMs do not necessarily require features on nodes, while GNNs cannot
exploit the network edges alone, and the choice of input features matters. We
find that GNNs are outperformed by PGMs when input features are low-dimensional
or noisy, mimicking many real scenarios where node attributes might be scalar
or noisy. Then, we find that PGMs are more robust than GNNs when the
heterophily of the graph is increased. Finally, to assess performance beyond
prediction tasks, we also compare the two frameworks in terms of their
computational complexity and interpretability.

Conclusion: 该方法为处理‘不可触及’矩阵提供了一种新途径。

Abstract: Computing eigenvalues of very large matrices is a critical task in many
machine learning applications, including the evaluation of log-determinants,
the trace of matrix functions, and other important metrics. As datasets
continue to grow in scale, the corresponding covariance and kernel matrices
become increasingly large, often reaching magnitudes that make their direct
formation impractical or impossible. Existing techniques typically rely on
matrix-vector products, which can provide efficient approximations, if the
matrix spectrum behaves well. However, in settings like distributed learning,
or when the matrix is defined only indirectly, access to the full data set can
be restricted to only very small sub-matrices of the original matrix. In these
cases, the matrix of nominal interest is not even available as an implicit
operator, meaning that even matrix-vector products may not be available. In
such settings, the matrix is "impalpable," in the sense that we have access to
only masked snapshots of it. We draw on principles from free probability theory
to introduce a novel method of "free decompression" to estimate the spectrum of
such matrices. Our method can be used to extrapolate from the empirical
spectral densities of small submatrices to infer the eigenspectrum of extremely
large (impalpable) matrices (that we cannot form or even evaluate with full
matrix-vector products). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
through a series of examples, comparing its performance against known limiting
distributions from random matrix theory in synthetic settings, as well as
applying it to submatrices of real-world datasets, matching them with their
full empirical eigenspectra.

Abstract: Research on lane change prediction has gained a lot of momentum in the last
couple of years. However, most research is confined to simulation or results
obtained from datasets, leaving a gap between algorithmic advances and on-road
deployment. This work closes that gap by demonstrating, on real hardware, a
lane-change prediction system based on Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) and
Bayesian inference. Moreover, the ego-vehicle employs a longitudinal braking
action to ensure the safety of both itself and the surrounding vehicles. Our
architecture consists of two modules: (i) a perception module that senses the
environment, derives input numerical features, and converts them into
linguistic categories; and communicates them to the prediction module; (ii) a
pretrained prediction module that executes a KGE and Bayesian inference model
to anticipate the target vehicle's maneuver and transforms the prediction into
longitudinal braking action. Real-world hardware experimental validation
demonstrates that our prediction system anticipates the target vehicle's lane
change three to four seconds in advance, providing the ego vehicle sufficient
time to react and allowing the target vehicle to make the lane change safely.

Conclusion: DPUV4E显著提升了Versal架构的性能和能效，适用于多种卷积神经网络模型。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) remain prevalent in computer vision
applications, and FPGAs, known for their flexibility and energy efficiency,
have become essential components in heterogeneous acceleration systems.
However, traditional FPGAs face challenges in balancing performance and
versatility due to limited on-chip resources. AMD's Versal ACAP architecture,
tailored for AI applications, incorporates AI Engines (AIEs) to deliver high
computational power. Nevertheless, the platform suffers from insufficient
memory bandwidth, hindering the full utilization of the AIEs' theoretical
performance. In this paper, we present DPUV4E for the Versal architecture,
providing configurations ranging from 2PE ($32.6$ TOPS) to 8PE ($131.0$ TOPS).
We design two computation units, Conv PE and DWC PE, to support different
computational patterns. Each computation unit's data flow efficiently utilizes
the data reuse opportunities to mitigate bandwidth bottlenecks. Additionally,
we extend the functionality of each PE to utilize AIEs for non-convolutional
operations, reducing resource overhead. Experiments on over 50 models show that
compared to previous designs, our design provides $8.6\times$ the TOPS/W of
traditional FPGA-based DPU designs, while reducing DSP usage by $95.8\%$, LUT
usage by $44.7\%$, and latency to $68.5\%$ under single-batch conditions. For
end-to-end inference, our design improving throughput by up to $2.2\times$ for
depth-wise convolution models and up to $1.3\times$ for standard models.

Abstract: Mental stress has become a pervasive factor affecting cognitive health and
overall well-being, necessitating the development of robust, non-invasive
diagnostic tools. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provide a direct window
into neural activity, yet their non-stationary and high-dimensional nature
poses significant modeling challenges. Here we introduce Brain2Vec, a new deep
learning tool that classifies stress states from raw EEG recordings using a
hybrid architecture of convolutional, recurrent, and attention mechanisms. The
model begins with a series of convolutional layers to capture localized spatial
dependencies, followed by an LSTM layer to model sequential temporal patterns,
and concludes with an attention mechanism to emphasize informative temporal
regions. We evaluate Brain2Vec on the DEAP dataset, applying bandpass
filtering, z-score normalization, and epoch segmentation as part of a
comprehensive preprocessing pipeline. Compared to traditional CNN-LSTM
baselines, our proposed model achieves an AUC score of 0.68 and a validation
accuracy of 81.25%. These findings demonstrate Brain2Vec's potential for
integration into wearable stress monitoring platforms and personalized

network designed for accurate state estimation with consistent error covariance
quantification. Our approach propagates error covariance using the recursive

Abstract: High-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy plays a critical role in the treatment of
locally advanced cervical cancer but remains highly dependent on manual
treatment planning expertise. The objective of this study is to develop a fully
automated HDR brachytherapy planning framework that integrates reinforcement
learning (RL) and dose-based optimization to generate clinically acceptable
treatment plans with improved consistency and efficiency. We propose a
hierarchical two-stage autoplanning framework. In the first stage, a deep
Q-network (DQN)-based RL agent iteratively selects treatment planning
parameters (TPPs), which control the trade-offs between target coverage and
organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing. The agent's state representation includes both
dose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics and current TPP values, while its reward
function incorporates clinical dose objectives and safety constraints,
including D90, V150, V200 for targets, and D2cc for all relevant OARs (bladder,
rectum, sigmoid, small bowel, and large bowel). In the second stage, a
customized Adam-based optimizer computes the corresponding dwell time
distribution for the selected TPPs using a clinically informed loss function.
The framework was evaluated on a cohort of patients with complex applicator
geometries. The proposed framework successfully learned clinically meaningful
TPP adjustments across diverse patient anatomies. For the unseen test patients,
the RL-based automated planning method achieved an average score of 93.89%,
outperforming the clinical plans which averaged 91.86%. These findings are
notable given that score improvements were achieved while maintaining full
target coverage and reducing CTV hot spots in most cases.

Abstract: As Diffusion Models (DM) generate increasingly realistic images, related
issues such as copyright and misuse have become a growing concern. Watermarking
is one of the promising solutions. Existing methods inject the watermark into
the single-domain of initial Gaussian noise for generation, which suffers from
unsatisfactory robustness. This paper presents the first dual-domain DM
watermarking approach using a pipelined injector to consistently embed
watermarks in both the spatial and frequency domains. To further boost
robustness against certain image manipulations and advanced attacks, we
introduce a model-independent learnable Gaussian Noise Restorer (GNR) to refine
Gaussian noise extracted from manipulated images and enhance detection

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在音频-视觉任务中表现出色，但其依赖第三方数据和开源模型带来了安全风险，现有研究缺乏对各种攻击类型的统一综述。

Method: 通过系统综述，分析了音频-视觉攻击的多种类型，包括对抗攻击、后门攻击和越狱攻击，并总结了最新MLLMs中的攻击案例。

Conclusion: 本文填补了音频-视觉攻击综述的空白，为未来研究提供了挑战与趋势的指导。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which bridge the gap between
audio-visual and natural language processing, achieve state-of-the-art
performance on several audio-visual tasks. Despite the superior performance of
MLLMs, the scarcity of high-quality audio-visual training data and
computational resources necessitates the utilization of third-party data and
open-source MLLMs, a trend that is increasingly observed in contemporary
research. This prosperity masks significant security risks. Empirical studies
demonstrate that the latest MLLMs can be manipulated to produce malicious or
harmful content. This manipulation is facilitated exclusively through
instructions or inputs, including adversarial perturbations and malevolent
queries, effectively bypassing the internal security mechanisms embedded within
the models. To gain a deeper comprehension of the inherent security
vulnerabilities associated with audio-visual-based multimodal models, a series
of surveys investigates various types of attacks, including adversarial and
backdoor attacks. While existing surveys on audio-visual attacks provide a
comprehensive overview, they are limited to specific types of attacks, which
lack a unified review of various types of attacks. To address this issue and
gain insights into the latest trends in the field, this paper presents a
comprehensive and systematic review of audio-visual attacks, which include
adversarial attacks, backdoor attacks, and jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, this
paper also reviews various types of attacks in the latest audio-visual-based
MLLMs, a dimension notably absent in existing surveys. Drawing upon
comprehensive insights from a substantial review, this paper delineates both
challenges and emergent trends for future research on audio-visual attacks and
defense.

TL;DR: SecONNds是一个针对大规模神经网络的安全推理框架，通过优化计算和通信开销，显著提升了隐私保护推理的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决外包神经网络推理中的隐私问题，同时降低现有安全推理框架的高计算和通信成本。

Method: 采用完全布尔GMW协议、NTT预处理和GPU加速，优化线性和非线性操作。

Result: 在GPU上实现2.8秒的端到端推理时间，通信开销仅为420 MiB。

Conclusion: SecONNds高效且适合资源受限环境，为隐私敏感应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of outsourced neural network inference presents
significant privacy challenges, as sensitive user data is processed on
untrusted remote servers. Secure inference offers a privacy-preserving
solution, but existing frameworks suffer from high computational overhead and
communication costs, rendering them impractical for real-world deployment. We
introduce SecONNds, a non-intrusive secure inference framework optimized for
large ImageNet-scale Convolutional Neural Networks. SecONNds integrates a novel
fully Boolean Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson (GMW) protocol for secure comparison
-- addressing Yao's millionaires' problem -- using preprocessed Beaver's bit
triples generated from Silent Random Oblivious Transfer. Our novel protocol
achieves an online speedup of 17$\times$ in nonlinear operations compared to
state-of-the-art solutions while reducing communication overhead. To further
enhance performance, SecONNds employs Number Theoretic Transform (NTT)
preprocessing and leverages GPU acceleration for homomorphic encryption
operations, resulting in speedups of 1.6$\times$ on CPU and 2.2$\times$ on GPU
for linear operations. We also present SecONNds-P, a bit-exact variant that
ensures verifiable full-precision results in secure computation, matching the
results of plaintext computations. Evaluated on a 37-bit quantized SqueezeNet
model, SecONNds achieves an end-to-end inference time of 2.8 s on GPU and 3.6 s
on CPU, with a total communication of just 420 MiB. SecONNds' efficiency and
reduced computational load make it well-suited for deploying privacy-sensitive
applications in resource-constrained environments. SecONNds is open source and
can be accessed from: https://github.com/shashankballa/SecONNds.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型（LLM）的欺诈分析师助手（FAA）框架，用于自动化信用卡欺诈调查并生成解释性报告，以减轻分析师的工作负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子商务行业的持续增长导致信用卡欺诈增多，分析师面临大量警报调查任务，导致疲劳。需要自动化工具来提升效率和可靠性。

Method: FAA框架利用LLM的推理、代码执行和视觉能力，分七个步骤进行规划、证据收集和分析。

Result: 对500起信用卡欺诈调查的实证评估显示，FAA框架能可靠且高效地完成调查。

Conclusion: FAA框架能够自动化大部分工作，有效减轻欺诈分析师的负担。

Abstract: The continuous growth of the e-commerce industry attracts fraudsters who
exploit stolen credit card details. Companies often investigate suspicious
transactions in order to retain customer trust and address gaps in their fraud
detection systems. However, analysts are overwhelmed with an enormous number of
alerts from credit card transaction monitoring systems. Each alert
investigation requires from the fraud analysts careful attention, specialized
knowledge, and precise documentation of the outcomes, leading to alert fatigue.
To address this, we propose a fraud analyst assistant (FAA) framework, which
employs multi-modal large language models (LLMs) to automate credit card fraud
investigations and generate explanatory reports. The FAA framework leverages
the reasoning, code execution, and vision capabilities of LLMs to conduct
planning, evidence collection, and analysis in each investigation step. A
comprehensive empirical evaluation of 500 credit card fraud investigations
demonstrates that the FAA framework produces reliable and efficient
investigations comprising seven steps on average. Thus we found that the FAA
framework can automate large parts of the workload and help reduce the
challenges faced by fraud analysts.

Conclusion: 差分隐私为机器学习提供了有效的隐私保护框架，但仍需应对挑战，如对抗攻击，以推动安全AI的发展。

Abstract: Machine learning models should not reveal particular information that is not
otherwise accessible. Differential privacy provides a formal framework to
mitigate privacy risks by ensuring that the inclusion or exclusion of any
single data point does not significantly alter the output of an algorithm, thus
limiting the exposure of private information. This survey paper explores the
foundational definitions of differential privacy, reviews its original
formulations and tracing its evolution through key research contributions. It
then provides an in-depth examination of how DP has been integrated into
machine learning models, analyzing existing proposals and methods to preserve
privacy when training ML models. Finally, it describes how DP-based ML
techniques can be evaluated in practice. %Finally, it discusses the broader
implications of DP, highlighting its potential for public benefit, its
real-world applications, and the challenges it faces, including vulnerabilities
to adversarial attacks. By offering a comprehensive overview of differential
privacy in machine learning, this work aims to contribute to the ongoing
development of secure and responsible AI systems.

Abstract: Modern life has witnessed the explosion of mobile devices. However, besides
the valuable features that bring convenience to end users, security and privacy
risks still threaten users of mobile apps. The increasing sophistication of
these threats in recent years has underscored the need for more advanced and
efficient detection approaches. In this chapter, we explore the application of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify security risks and privacy violations
and mitigate them for the mobile application ecosystem. By introducing
state-of-the-art research that applied LLMs to mitigate the top 10 common
security risks of smartphone platforms, we highlight the feasibility and
potential of LLMs to replace traditional analysis methods, such as dynamic and
hybrid analysis of mobile apps. As a representative example of LLM-based
solutions, we present an approach to detect sensitive data leakage when users
share images online, a common behavior of smartphone users nowadays. Finally,
we discuss open research challenges.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种方法，通过动态调整训练和测试标签以反映随时间变化的知识，验证了模型性能随时间的变化趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有漏洞数据集在ML测试中隐含了回顾性信息，导致过去性能与未来表现不一致，现有方法要么过于乐观（使用完整历史数据），要么过于保守（仅考虑连续发布版本）。

Method: 将数据集重构为一系列动态调整标签的数据集，使用Mann-Kendall检验验证模型性能随时间的变化趋势。

Result: 在4个时间数据集和5种ML模型上的验证表明，模型性能随时间变化不一致，多数模型并未真正学习。

Conclusion: 动态调整标签的方法揭示了模型性能的不稳定趋势，表明多数模型未能有效学习。

Abstract: Vulnerability datasets used for ML testing implicitly contain retrospective
information. When tested on the field, one can only use the labels available at
the time of training and testing (e.g. seen and assumed negatives). As
vulnerabilities are discovered across calendar time, labels change and past
performance is not necessarily aligned with future performance. Past works only
considered the slices of the whole history (e.g. DiverseVUl) or individual
differences between releases (e.g. Jimenez et al. ESEC/FSE 2019). Such
approaches are either too optimistic in training (e.g. the whole history) or
too conservative (e.g. consecutive releases). We propose a method to
restructure a dataset into a series of datasets in which both training and
testing labels change to account for the knowledge available at the time. If
the model is actually learning, it should improve its performance over time as
more data becomes available and data becomes more stable, an effect that can be
checked with the Mann-Kendall test. We validate our methodology for
vulnerability detection with 4 time-based datasets (3 projects from BigVul
dataset + Vuldeepecker's NVD) and 5 ML models (Code2Vec, CodeBERT, LineVul,
ReGVD, and Vuldeepecker). In contrast to the intuitive expectation (more
retrospective information, better performance), the trend results show that
performance changes inconsistently across the years, showing that most models
are not learning.

Abstract: We present a technical evaluation of a new, disruptive cryptographic approach
to data security, known as HbHAI (Hash-based Homomorphic Artificial
Intelligence). HbHAI is based on a novel class of key-dependent hash functions
that naturally preserve most similarity properties, most AI algorithms rely on.
As a main claim, HbHAI makes now possible to analyze and process data in its
cryptographically secure form while using existing native AI algorithms without
modification, with unprecedented performances compared to existing homomorphic
encryption schemes.
  We tested various HbHAI-protected datasets (non public preview) using
traditional unsupervised and supervised learning techniques (clustering,
classification, deep neural networks) with classical unmodified AI algorithms.
This paper presents technical results from an independent analysis conducted
with those different, off-the-shelf AI algorithms. The aim was to assess the
security, operability and performance claims regarding HbHAI techniques. As a
results, our results confirm most these claims, with only a few minor
reservations.

Motivation: 实践中预测概率很少完美多校准，需要一种度量方法评估与完美多校准的距离。

Method: 基于Kuiper统计量设计新度量，加权子群体信号噪声比贡献。

Result: 新度量避免了传统方法的缺陷，数值实验验证其有效性。

Conclusion: 新度量在多校准评估中表现优越，信号噪声比加权是关键。

Abstract: A suitable scalar metric can help measure multi-calibration, defined as
follows. When the expected values of observed responses are equal to
corresponding predicted probabilities, the probabilistic predictions are known
as "perfectly calibrated." When the predicted probabilities are perfectly
calibrated simultaneously across several subpopulations, the probabilistic
predictions are known as "perfectly multi-calibrated." In practice, predicted
probabilities are seldom perfectly multi-calibrated, so a statistic measuring
the distance from perfect multi-calibration is informative. A recently proposed
metric for calibration, based on the classical Kuiper statistic, is a natural
basis for a new metric of multi-calibration and avoids well-known problems of
metrics based on binning or kernel density estimation. The newly proposed
metric weights the contributions of different subpopulations in proportion to
their signal-to-noise ratios; data analyses' ablations demonstrate that the
metric becomes noisy when omitting the signal-to-noise ratios from the metric.
Numerical examples on benchmark data sets illustrate the new metric.

Conclusion: 分析似然函数有助于理解意见动力学模型参数估计的局限与可能，并为校准提供形式保证。

Abstract: Opinion dynamics models such as the bounded confidence models (BCMs) describe
how a population can reach consensus, fragmentation, or polarization, depending
on a few parameters. Connecting such models to real-world data could help
understanding such phenomena, testing model assumptions. To this end,
estimation of model parameters is a key aspect, and maximum likelihood
estimation provides a principled way to tackle it. Here, our goal is to outline
the properties of statistical estimators of the two key BCM parameters: the
confidence bound and the convergence rate. We find that their maximum
likelihood estimators present different characteristics: the one for the
confidence bound presents a small-sample bias but is consistent, while the
estimator of the convergence rate shows a persistent bias. Moreover, the joint
parameter estimation is affected by identifiability issues for specific regions
of the parameter space, as several local maxima are present in the likelihood
function. Our results show how the analysis of the likelihood function is a
fruitful approach for better understanding the pitfalls and possibilities of
estimating the parameters of opinion dynamics models, and more in general,
agent-based models, and for offering formal guarantees for their calibration.

Conclusion: 预训练基础模型和染色质可及性数据对gRNA活性预测非常有效。

Abstract: Predicting guide RNA (gRNA) activity is critical for effective CRISPR-Cas12

protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs-short sequence requirements for Cas binding),
and reliance on large-scale training. We investigate whether pre-trained
biological foundation model originally trained on transcriptomic data can
improve gRNA activity estimation even without domain-specific pre-training.
Using embeddings from existing RNA foundation model as input to lightweight

integrate chromatin accessibility data to capture regulatory context, improving
performance further. Our results highlight the effectiveness of pre-trained
foundation models and chromatin accessibility data for gRNA activity

TL;DR: HEIST是一种基于层次图变换器的空间转录组学基础模型，通过建模细胞邻域图和基因调控网络图，结合对比学习和掩码自编码目标，实现了对微环境影响的编码，并在多个下游任务中表现优异。

Motivation: 现有模型忽略了空间分辨率或基因调控信息，而HEIST旨在通过层次化建模和基因调控网络（GRN）表示，解决这一问题。

Method: HEIST将组织建模为空间细胞邻域图，每个细胞建模为GRN图，采用层次图变换器进行跨层和层内消息传递，并通过对比学习和掩码自编码进行预训练。

Result: HEIST在22.3M细胞上预训练，能有效编码微环境影响，发现空间信息亚群，并在临床预测、细胞注释、基因填补和空间聚类等任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: HEIST通过层次化建模和GRN表示，显著提升了空间转录组学数据的分析能力。

Abstract: Single-cell transcriptomics has become a great source for data-driven
insights into biology, enabling the use of advanced deep learning methods to
understand cellular heterogeneity and transcriptional regulation at the
single-cell level. With the advent of spatial transcriptomics data we have the
promise of learning about cells within a tissue context as it provides both
spatial coordinates and transcriptomic readouts. However, existing models
either ignore spatial resolution or the gene regulatory information. Gene
regulation in cells can change depending on microenvironmental cues from
neighboring cells, but existing models neglect gene regulatory patterns with
hierarchical dependencies across levels of abstraction. In order to create
contextualized representations of cells and genes from spatial transcriptomics
data, we introduce HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer-based foundation
model for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics data. HEIST models tissue as
spatial cellular neighborhood graphs, and each cell is, in turn, modeled as a
gene regulatory network graph. The framework includes a hierarchical graph
transformer that performs cross-level message passing and message passing
within levels. HEIST is pre-trained on 22.3M cells from 124 tissues across 15
organs using spatially-aware contrastive learning and masked auto-encoding
objectives. Unsupervised analysis of HEIST representations of cells, shows that
it effectively encodes the microenvironmental influences in cell embeddings,
enabling the discovery of spatially-informed subpopulations that prior models
fail to differentiate. Further, HEIST achieves state-of-the-art results on four
downstream task such as clinical outcome prediction, cell type annotation, gene
imputation, and spatially-informed cell clustering across multiple
technologies, highlighting the importance of hierarchical modeling and
GRN-based representations.

gene expression data sparsely sampled in the healthy human brain, and produce
fully resolved spatial maps of any given gene across the whole brain at a
voxel-level resolution. To do so, we first obtained the 100 top AD risk genes,
whose baseline spatial transcriptional profiles were obtained from the Allen
Human Brain Atlas (AHBA). We adapted Implicit Neural Representation models so
that the pipeline can produce robust voxel-resolution quantitative maps of all
genes. We present a variety of experiments using interpolations obtained from

Motivation: 当前空间转录组分析方法存在噪声大、可扩展性差和复杂细胞关系建模不足的问题。

Method: 构建多语义图（空间邻近性、基因表达相似性、组织域结构），通过注意力机制融合解耦嵌入，并使用社区感知最小割损失提升鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个平台和组织中，性能指标（ARI、NMI、轨迹保真度）提升20%，并在乳腺癌数据中发现临床显著稀有细胞群。

Conclusion: SemanticST为空间转录组分析提供了可扩展、可解释且生物学意义明确的框架，推动精准医学发展。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies enable gene expression profiling
with spatial resolution, offering unprecedented insights into tissue
organization and disease heterogeneity. However, current analysis methods often
struggle with noisy data, limited scalability, and inadequate modelling of
complex cellular relationships. We present SemanticST, a biologically informed,
graph-based deep learning framework that models diverse cellular contexts
through multi-semantic graph construction. SemanticST builds multiple
context-specific graphs capturing spatial proximity, gene expression
similarity, and tissue domain structure, and learns disentangled embeddings for
each. These are fused using an attention-inspired strategy to yield a unified,
biologically meaningful representation. A community-aware min-cut loss improves
robustness over contrastive learning, particularly in sparse ST data.
SemanticST supports mini-batch training, making it the first graph neural
network scalable to large-scale datasets such as Xenium (500,000 cells).
Benchmarking across four platforms (Visium, Slide-seq, Stereo-seq, Xenium) and
multiple human and mouse tissues shows consistent 20 percentage gains in ARI,
NMI, and trajectory fidelity over DeepST, GraphST, and IRIS. In re-analysis of
breast cancer Xenium data, SemanticST revealed rare and clinically significant
niches, including triple receptor-positive clusters, spatially distinct
DCIS-to-IDC transition zones, and FOXC2 tumour-associated myoepithelial cells,
suggesting non-canonical EMT programs with stem-like features. SemanticST thus
provides a scalable, interpretable, and biologically grounded framework for
spatial transcriptomics analysis, enabling robust discovery across tissue types
and diseases, and paving the way for spatially resolved tissue atlases and
next-generation precision medicine.

Result: 该方法为光学神经网络提供了一种高效的硬件训练策略，避免了有限差分近似和全光学反向传播的局限性。

Conclusion: PSR为光学计算系统的硬件训练提供了潜在的高效解决方案，推动了光学神经网络的发展。

Abstract: This paper explores the application of the parameter-shift rule (PSR) for
computing gradients in unitary optical neural networks (UONNs). While
backpropagation has been fundamental to training conventional neural networks,
its implementation in optical neural networks faces significant challenges due
to the physical constraints of optical systems. We demonstrate how PSR, which
calculates gradients by evaluating functions at shifted parameter values, can
be effectively adapted for training UONNs constructed from Mach-Zehnder
interferometer meshes. The method leverages the inherent Fourier series nature
of optical interference in these systems to compute exact analytical gradients
directly from hardware measurements. This approach offers a promising
alternative to traditional in silico training methods and circumvents the
limitations of both finite difference approximations and all-optical
backpropagation implementations. We present the theoretical framework and
practical methodology for applying PSR to optimize phase parameters in optical
neural networks, potentially advancing the development of efficient
hardware-based training strategies for optical computing systems.

Motivation: 解决无约束优化问题中传统方法依赖问题相关参数（如Lipschitz常数）的局限性，并扩展适用性至弱平滑和重尾噪声条件。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose practical normalized stochastic first-order methods
with Polyak momentum, multi-extrapolated momentum, and recursive momentum for
solving unconstrained optimization problems. These methods employ dynamically
updated algorithmic parameters and do not require explicit knowledge of
problem-dependent quantities such as the Lipschitz constant or noise bound. We
establish first-order oracle complexity results for finding approximate
stochastic stationary points under heavy-tailed noise and weakly average
smoothness conditions -- both of which are weaker than the commonly used
bounded variance and mean-squared smoothness assumptions. Our complexity bounds
either improve upon or match the best-known results in the literature.
Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the practical effectiveness
of the proposed methods.

Abstract: Price signals from distribution networks (DNs) guide energy communities (ECs)
to adjust energy usage, enabling effective coordination for reliable power
system operation. However, this coordination faces significant challenges due
to the limited availability of information (i.e., only the aggregated energy
usage of ECs is available to DNs), and the high computational burden of
accounting for uncertainties and the associated risks through numerous
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a quantum learning and
estimation approach to enhance coordination between DNs and ECs. Specifically,
leveraging advanced quantum properties such as quantum superposition and
entanglement, we develop a hybrid quantum temporal convolutional network-long
short-term memory (Q-TCN-LSTM) model to establish an end-to-end mapping between
ECs' responses and the price incentives from DNs. Moreover, we develop a
quantum estimation method based on quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) and two
phase-rotation circuits to significantly accelerate the optimization process
under numerous uncertainty scenarios. Numerical experiments demonstrate that,
compared to classical neural networks, the proposed Q-TCN-LSTM model improves
the mapping accuracy by 69.2% while reducing the model size by 99.75% and the
computation time by 93.9%. Compared to classical Monte Carlo simulation, QAE
achieves comparable accuracy with a dramatic reduction in computational time
(up to 99.99%) and requires significantly fewer computational resources.

Method: 提出统一算法，动量项随时间变化，适用于多种随机梯度方法。

Result: 给出收敛的充分条件，并分析现有方法的不可行性。

Conclusion: 统一算法具有广泛适用性，理论支持强，但某些现有方法不实用。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a unified algorithm for stochastic optimization
that makes use of a "momentum" term; in other words, the stochastic gradient
depends not only on the current true gradient of the objective function, but
also on the true gradient at the previous iteration. Our formulation includes
the Stochastic Heavy Ball (SHB) and the Stochastic Nesterov Accelerated
Gradient (SNAG) algorithms as special cases. In addition, in our formulation,
the momentum term is allowed to vary as a function of time (i.e., the iteration
counter). The assumptions on the stochastic gradient are the most general in
the literature, in that it can be biased, and have a conditional variance that
grows in an unbounded fashion as a function of time. This last feature is
crucial in order to make the theory applicable to "zero-order" methods, where
the gradient is estimated using just two function evaluations.
  We present a set of sufficient conditions for the convergence of the unified
algorithm. These conditions are natural generalizations of the familiar
Robbins-Monro and Kiefer-Wolfowitz-Blum conditions for standard stochastic
gradient descent. We also analyze another method from the literature for the
SHB algorithm with a time-varying momentum parameter, and show that it is
impracticable.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 该论文研究了预训练语音表示（如wav2vec2和HuBERT）的各向异性对关键词识别任务的影响，发现尽管存在各向异性，这些表示仍能有效识别未转录的单词。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语音表示的各向异性现象普遍存在，但其对下游任务的具体影响尚不明确，特别是在计算纪录片语言学中的关键词识别任务中。

Method: 使用动态时间规整（Dynamic Time Warping）方法评估wav2vec2在各向异性情况下的相似性度量效果。

Result: 结果显示，尽管存在各向异性，wav2vec2的相似性度量仍能有效识别未转录的单词，且能捕捉语音结构并跨说话者泛化。

Conclusion: 研究强调了预训练在学习丰富且不变的语音表示中的重要性。

Abstract: Pretrained speech representations like wav2vec2 and HuBERT exhibit strong
anisotropy, leading to high similarity between random embeddings. While widely
observed, the impact of this property on downstream tasks remains unclear. This
work evaluates anisotropy in keyword spotting for computational documentary
linguistics. Using Dynamic Time Warping, we show that despite anisotropy,
wav2vec2 similarity measures effectively identify words without transcription.
Our results highlight the robustness of these representations, which capture
phonetic structures and generalize across speakers. Our results underscore the
importance of pretraining in learning rich and invariant speech
representations.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: GLAP扩展了CLAP，增加了多语言和多领域能力，在音频-文本检索、语音检索和分类任务中表现优异，并在50种语言的关键词识别中展示了其多语言能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CLAP方法仅支持英语，忽略了多语言语音内容，因此需要一种更通用的方法。

Method: 引入通用语言音频预训练（GLAP），扩展CLAP以支持多语言和多领域任务。

Result: GLAP在标准音频-文本检索任务中表现优异，显著超越现有方法，并在多语言任务中展示了强大能力。

Conclusion: GLAP是一种多功能且强大的方法，适用于多语言和多领域的音频-文本任务。

Abstract: Contrastive Language Audio Pretraining (CLAP) is a widely-used method to
bridge the gap between audio and text domains. Current CLAP methods enable
sound and music retrieval in English, ignoring multilingual spoken content. To
address this, we introduce general language audio pretraining (GLAP), which
expands CLAP with multilingual and multi-domain abilities. GLAP demonstrates
its versatility by achieving competitive performance on standard audio-text
retrieval benchmarks like Clotho and AudioCaps, while significantly surpassing
existing methods in speech retrieval and classification tasks. Additionally,
GLAP achieves strong results on widely used sound-event zero-shot benchmarks,
while simultaneously outperforming previous methods on speech content
benchmarks. Further keyword spotting evaluations across 50 languages emphasize
GLAP's advanced multilingual capabilities. Finally, multilingual sound and
music understanding is evaluated across four languages. Checkpoints and Source:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SimPhon Speech Test-25的新型语音测试方法，通过计算模拟和优化，捕捉传统听力测试无法检测的听力损失影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统听力测试对老年性听力损失的超阈值缺陷描述不足，需要更具体的诊断方法。

Method: 利用自动语音识别系统模拟听力损失，通过多阶段计算流程设计和验证语音测试集。

Result: 最终优化的25对测试项与传统语音可懂度指数无显著相关性，表明其能捕捉更多感知缺陷。

Conclusion: SimPhon Speech Test-25为听力测试开发提供了高效方法，适合进一步临床试验。

Abstract: Traditional audiometry often provides an incomplete characterization of the
functional impact of hearing loss on speech understanding, particularly for
supra-threshold deficits common in presbycusis. This motivates the development
of more diagnostically specific speech perception tests. We introduce the
Simulated Phoneme Speech Test (SimPhon Speech Test) methodology, a novel,
multi-stage computational pipeline for the in silico design and validation of a
phonetically balanced minimal-pair speech test. This methodology leverages a
modern Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system as a proxy for a human
listener to simulate the perceptual effects of sensorineural hearing loss. By
processing speech stimuli under controlled acoustic degradation, we first
identify the most common phoneme confusion patterns. These patterns then guide
the data-driven curation of a large set of candidate word pairs derived from a
comprehensive linguistic corpus. Subsequent phases involving simulated
diagnostic testing, expert human curation, and a final, targeted sensitivity
analysis systematically reduce the candidates to a final, optimized set of 25
pairs (the SimPhon Speech Test-25). A key finding is that the diagnostic
performance of the SimPhon Speech Test-25 test items shows no significant
correlation with predictions from the standard Speech Intelligibility Index
(SII), suggesting the SimPhon Speech Test captures perceptual deficits beyond
simple audibility. This computationally optimized test set offers a significant
increase in efficiency for audiological test development, ready for initial
human trials.

TL;DR: 通过相关性置换方法合并独立训练的语音和音乐编码器，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一语音和音乐模型通常需要昂贵的预训练，而直接合并未对齐的模型具有挑战性。

Method: 引入相关性置换方法，逐层对齐语音和音乐编码器的权重空间，并扩展到Transformer层合并。

Result: 合并后的模型在保留语音能力的同时，音乐性能显著提升，比线性插值模型平均得分高14.83分。

Conclusion: 该方法为独立训练的编码器创建统一音频模型提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Creating a unified speech and music model requires expensive pre-training.
Model merging can instead create an unified audio model with minimal
computational expense. However, direct merging is challenging when the models
are not aligned in the weight space. Motivated by Git Re-Basin, we introduce a
correlation-permutation approach that aligns a music encoder's internal layers
with a speech encoder. We extend previous work to the case of merging
transformer layers. The method computes a permutation matrix that maximizes the
model's features-wise cross-correlations layer by layer, enabling effective
fusion of these otherwise disjoint models. The merged model retains speech
capabilities through this method while significantly enhancing music
performance, achieving an improvement of 14.83 points in average score compared
to linear interpolation model merging. This work allows the creation of unified
audio models from independently trained encoders.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SOTA模型缺乏精细的时间变化控制，且ControlNet方法内存占用大、灵活性低。

Method: 采用轻量级模块化架构，减少参数数量，同时匹配ControlNet的音频质量和条件遵循。

Result: 新方法在音频质量和条件遵循上与ControlNet相当，但内存占用更低，灵活性更高。

Conclusion: 该方法为独立控制提供了更高效的训练和部署方案，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Text-to-audio diffusion models produce high-quality and diverse music but
many, if not most, of the SOTA models lack the fine-grained, time-varying
controls essential for music production. ControlNet enables attaching external
controls to a pre-trained generative model by cloning and fine-tuning its
encoder on new conditionings. However, this approach incurs a large memory
footprint and restricts users to a fixed set of controls. We propose a
lightweight, modular architecture that considerably reduces parameter count
while matching ControlNet in audio quality and condition adherence. Our method
offers greater flexibility and significantly lower memory usage, enabling more
efficient training and deployment of independent controls. We conduct extensive
objective and subjective evaluations and provide numerous audio examples on the
accompanying website at https://lightlatentcontrol.github.io

TL;DR: 论文提出一种方法，通过自动检测长音频中可被现代ASR系统可靠转录的部分，实现相对准确的转录，验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究儿童语言环境及其对语言发展的影响需要转录长音频，但手动标注不现实，而现有ASR技术因音频噪声问题难以直接应用。

Method: 提出一种方法，仅转录长音频中可被ASR系统可靠识别的部分，而非全部音频。

Result: 在四个英语长音频语料库中验证，该方法可转录13%的语音，中位WER为0%，平均WER为18%，显著优于无过滤的转录（中位WER 52%，平均WER 51%）。

Conclusion: 该方法为儿童长音频的自动化语言分析提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Longform audio recordings obtained with microphones worn by children-also
known as child-centered daylong recordings-have become a standard method for
studying children's language experiences and their impact on subsequent
language development. Transcripts of longform speech audio would enable rich
analyses at various linguistic levels, yet the massive scale of typical
longform corpora prohibits comprehensive manual annotation. At the same time,
automatic speech recognition (ASR)-based transcription faces significant
challenges due to the noisy, unconstrained nature of real-world audio, and no
existing study has successfully applied ASR to transcribe such data. However,
previous attempts have assumed that ASR must process each longform recording in
its entirety. In this work, we present an approach to automatically detect
those utterances in longform audio that can be reliably transcribed with modern
ASR systems, allowing automatic and relatively accurate transcription of a
notable proportion of all speech in typical longform data. We validate the
approach on four English longform audio corpora, showing that it achieves a
median word error rate (WER) of 0% and a mean WER of 18% when transcribing 13%
of the total speech in the dataset. In contrast, transcribing all speech
without any filtering yields a median WER of 52% and a mean WER of 51%. We also
compare word log-frequencies derived from the automatic transcripts with those
from manual annotations and show that the frequencies correlate at r = 0.92
(Pearson) for all transcribed words and r = 0.98 for words that appear at least
five times in the automatic transcripts. Overall, the work provides a concrete
step toward increasingly detailed automated linguistic analyses of
child-centered longform audio.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何合成抽象声音，使其不泄露可识别的真实世界声音事件，同时通过声音融合生成具有新听觉特征的声音。

Method: 采用反演技术，基于DPMSolver++采样器提出SDE和ODE反演模型，消除噪声预测项的循环依赖，无需提示条件即可实现灵活引导。

Result: 提出的反演方法能够生成超越简单叠加的新声音，同时保留原始样本的关键特征。

Conclusion: 该方法为声音融合提供了一种可控且灵活的新途径，无需依赖提示条件即可实现高质量合成。

Abstract: An abstract sound is defined as a sound that does not disclose identifiable
real-world sound events to a listener. Sound fusion aims to synthesize an
original sound and a reference sound to generate a novel sound that exhibits
auditory features beyond mere additive superposition of the sound constituents.
To achieve this fusion, we employ inversion techniques that preserve essential
features of the original sample while enabling controllable synthesis. We
propose novel SDE and ODE inversion models based on DPMSolver++ samplers that
reverse the sampling process by configuring model outputs as constants,
eliminating circular dependencies incurred by noise prediction terms. Our
inversion approach requires no prompt conditioning while maintaining flexible
guidance during sampling.

Motivation: 传统舞蹈表演中音乐与动作的关系是单向的，AI在舞蹈领域的应用多局限于从音乐生成编舞。本文旨在打破这种单向性，探索舞者如何通过动作动态塑造音乐环境。

Method: 采用多模态架构，通过智能组合预录制的音乐片段，实时响应舞者动作，生成连贯的音乐作品。

Result: 通过表演数据的相关性分析，展示了动作特性与音频特征之间的新兴沟通模式。

Conclusion: 该系统重新定义了AI在表演艺术中的角色，使其成为响应式合作者，为专业舞蹈表演和即兴艺术表达提供了更多可能性。

Abstract: Dance performance traditionally follows a unidirectional relationship where
movement responds to music. While AI has advanced in various creative domains,
its application in dance has primarily focused on generating choreography from
musical input. We present a system that enables dancers to dynamically shape
musical environments through their movements. Our multi-modal architecture
creates a coherent musical composition by intelligently combining pre-recorded
musical clips in response to dance movements, establishing a bidirectional
creative partnership where dancers function as both performers and composers.
Through correlation analysis of performance data, we demonstrate emergent
communication patterns between movement qualities and audio features. This
approach reconceptualizes the role of AI in performing arts as a responsive
collaborator that expands possibilities for both professional dance performance
and improvisational artistic expression across broader populations.

Abstract: As AI tools proliferate across domains, from chatbots and copilots to
emerging agents, they increasingly support professional knowledge work. Yet
despite their growing capabilities, these systems remain fragmented: they
assist with isolated tasks but lack the architectural scaffolding for
sustained, adaptive collaboration. We propose a layered framework for
human-agent systems that integrates three interdependent dimensions:
interaction, process, and infrastructure. Crucially, our architecture elevates
process to a primary focus by making it explicit, inspectable, and adaptable,
enabling humans and agents to align with evolving goals and coordinate over
time. This model clarifies limitations of current tools, unifies emerging
system design approaches, and reveals new opportunities for researchers and AI
system builders. By grounding intelligent behavior in structured collaboration,
we reimagine human-agent collaboration not as task-specific augmentation, but
as a form of coherent and aligned system for real-world work.

Abstract: Virtual Reality simulators offer a powerful tool for teacher training, yet
the integration of AI-powered student avatars presents a critical challenge:
determining the optimal level of avatar realism for effective pedagogy. This
literature review examines the evolution of avatar realism in VR teacher
training, synthesizes its theoretical implications, and proposes a new
pedagogical framework to guide future design. Through a systematic review, this
paper traces the progression from human-controlled avatars to generative AI
prototypes. Applying learning theories like Cognitive Load Theory, we argue
that hyper-realism is not always optimal, as high-fidelity avatars can impose
excessive extraneous cognitive load on novices, a stance supported by recent
empirical findings. A significant gap exists between the technological drive
for photorealism and the pedagogical need for scaffolded learning. To address
this gap, we propose Graduated Realism, a framework advocating for starting
trainees with lower-fidelity avatars and progressively increasing behavioral
complexity as skills develop. To make this computationally feasible, we outline
a novel single-call architecture, Crazy Slots, which uses a probabilistic
engine and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation database to generate authentic,
real-time responses without the latency and cost of multi-step reasoning
models. This review provides evidence-based principles for designing the next
generation of AI simulators, arguing that a pedagogically grounded approach to
realism is essential for creating scalable and effective teacher education
tools.

Method: 通过2D和3D真实与合成信号的实验，比较INRs和网格表示在不同任务（如断层扫描、超分辨率和去噪）中的表现。

Result: 网格表示在大多数任务中训练更快且质量更高，而INRs在低维结构信号中表现更优。

Conclusion: INRs在特定场景下具有优势，未来应针对其优势领域（如低维结构信号）进行应用。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have recently shown impressive
results, but their fundamental capacity, implicit biases, and scaling behavior
remain poorly understood. We investigate the performance of diverse INRs across
a suite of 2D and 3D real and synthetic signals with varying effective
bandwidth, as well as both overfitting and generalization tasks including
tomography, super-resolution, and denoising. By stratifying performance
according to model size as well as signal type and bandwidth, our results shed
light on how different INR and grid representations allocate their capacity. We
find that, for most tasks and signals, a simple regularized grid with
interpolation trains faster and to higher quality than any INR with the same
number of parameters. We also find limited settings where INRs outperform grids
-- namely fitting signals with underlying lower-dimensional structure such as
shape contours -- to guide future use of INRs towards the most advantageous
applications. Code and synthetic signals used in our analysis are available at

Result: ADAgent在多模态诊断、预后及MRI和PET诊断任务中表现优于现有方法，准确性显著提升。

Conclusion: ADAgent为AD分析提供了首个专用AI代理，能够处理多模态数据并支持决策，性能优越。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative
disease. Early and precise diagnosis of AD is crucial for timely intervention
and treatment planning to alleviate the progressive neurodegeneration. However,
most existing methods rely on single-modality data, which contrasts with the
multifaceted approach used by medical experts. While some deep learning
approaches process multi-modal data, they are limited to specific tasks with a
small set of input modalities and cannot handle arbitrary combinations. This
highlights the need for a system that can address diverse AD-related tasks,
process multi-modal or missing input, and integrate multiple advanced methods
for improved performance. In this paper, we propose ADAgent, the first
specialized AI agent for AD analysis, built on a large language model (LLM) to
address user queries and support decision-making. ADAgent integrates a
reasoning engine, specialized medical tools, and a collaborative outcome
coordinator to facilitate multi-modal diagnosis and prognosis tasks in AD.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADAgent outperforms SOTA methods,
achieving significant improvements in accuracy, including a 2.7% increase in
multi-modal diagnosis, a 0.7% improvement in multi-modal prognosis, and
enhancements in MRI and PET diagnosis tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D卷积模型在处理树状几何数据时内存需求高，且难以保持拓扑结构一致性，需要一种更高效且精确的方法。

Method: 采用两阶段Transformer自编码器：第一阶段（Vessel Autoencoder）学习血管段的几何细节，第二阶段（Vessel Tree Autoencoder）编码血管网络的拓扑结构，并通过递归解码确保树状结构有效性。

Result: 在2D合成树数据集和3D冠状动脉数据集上表现出更高的重建保真度、拓扑结构保持能力和潜在空间插值效果。

Conclusion: VeTTA框架为医学影像中的树状结构提供了精确、灵活且拓扑一致的高效建模方法。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for learning vector representations of
tree-structured geometric data focusing on 3D vascular networks. Our approach
employs two sequentially trained Transformer-based autoencoders. In the first
stage, the Vessel Autoencoder captures continuous geometric details of
individual vessel segments by learning embeddings from sampled points along
each curve. In the second stage, the Vessel Tree Autoencoder encodes the
topology of the vascular network as a single vector representation, leveraging
the segment-level embeddings from the first model. A recursive decoding process
ensures that the reconstructed topology is a valid tree structure. Compared to
3D convolutional models, this proposed approach substantially lowers GPU memory
requirements, facilitating large-scale training. Experimental results on a 2D
synthetic tree dataset and a 3D coronary artery dataset demonstrate superior
reconstruction fidelity, accurate topology preservation, and realistic
interpolations in latent space. Our scalable framework, named VeTTA, offers
precise, flexible, and topologically consistent modeling of anatomical tree
structures in medical imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中过平滑问题导致QPI图像丢失高频细节，影响诊断效果。研究发现高频跳跃连接加剧了频谱偏差。

Method: DiffPR分为两阶段：1）取消高频跳跃连接的非对称U-Net预测低频相位图；2）扩散模型通过反向去噪恢复高频细节。

Result: 在四个QPI数据集上，DiffPR的PSNR提升1.1 dB，MAE降低11%，图像细节更清晰。

Conclusion: 取消高频跳跃连接并结合扩散模型是解决频谱偏差的有效方法，显著提升了相位恢复网络的性能。

Abstract: Oversmoothing remains a persistent problem when applying deep learning to
off-axis quantitative phase imaging (QPI). End-to-end U-Nets favour
low-frequency content and under-represent fine, diagnostic detail. We trace
this issue to spectral bias and show that the bias is reinforced by high-level
skip connections that feed high-frequency features directly into the decoder.
Removing those deepest skips thus supervising the network only at a low
resolution significantly improves generalisation and fidelity. Building on this
insight, we introduce DiffPR, a two-stage frequency-decoupled framework. Stage
1: an asymmetric U-Net with cancelled high-frequency skips predicts a
quarter-scale phase map from the interferogram, capturing reliable
low-frequency structure while avoiding spectral bias. Stage 2: the upsampled
prediction, lightly perturbed with Gaussian noise, is refined by an
unconditional diffusion model that iteratively recovers the missing
high-frequency residuals through reverse denoising. Experiments on four QPI
datasets (B-Cell, WBC, HeLa, 3T3) show that DiffPR outperforms strong U-Net
baselines, boosting PSNR by up to 1.1 dB and reducing MAE by 11 percent, while
delivering markedly sharper membrane ridges and speckle patterns. The results
demonstrate that cancelling high-level skips and delegating detail synthesis to
a diffusion prior is an effective remedy for the spectral bias that limits
conventional phase-retrieval networks.

*Joakim Andén,Justus Sagemüller*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的神经网络架构，用于同时聚类、对齐和去噪冷冻电镜图像，相比单图像DNN，在低信噪比下将相对均方误差降低了45%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DNN在高噪声环境（如冷冻电镜图像）中效果有限，但此类数据包含大量冗余信息，可用于改进去噪方法。

Method: 基于Transformer的神经网络架构，同时实现聚类、对齐和去噪。

Result: 在信噪比为0.03时，相对均方误差比单图像DNN降低了45%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用了数据的冗余信息，显著提升了高噪声环境下的去噪性能。

Abstract: Deep neural networks~(DNNs) have proven powerful for denoising, but they are
ultimately of limited use in high-noise settings, such as for cryogenic
electron microscopy~(cryo-EM) projection images. In this setting, however,
datasets contain a large number of projections of the same molecule, each taken
from a different viewing direction. This redundancy of information is useful in
traditional denoising techniques known as class averaging methods, where images
are clustered, aligned, and then averaged to reduce the noise level. We present
a neural network architecture based on transformers that extends these class
averaging methods by simultaneously clustering, aligning, and denoising cryo-EM
images. Results on synthetic data show accurate denoising performance using
this architecture, reducing the relative mean squared error (MSE) single-image
DNNs by $45\%$ at a signal-to-noise (SNR) of $0.03$.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于频域分析的深度学习模型FAD-Net，用于提高冠状动脉分割和狭窄检测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冠状动脉疾病（CAD）是全球主要死因之一，精确分割冠状动脉对临床决策至关重要。

Method: FAD-Net结合频域注意力机制和级联扩散策略，利用多级自注意力机制和低频扩散模块优化分割精度。

Result: 实验显示FAD-Net在分割和狭窄检测中表现优异，Dice系数达0.8717，临床适用性强。

Conclusion: FAD-Net在CAD的精确诊断和治疗规划中具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Background: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains one of the leading causes
of mortality worldwide. Precise segmentation of coronary arteries from invasive
coronary angiography (ICA) is critical for effective clinical decision-making.
Objective: This study aims to propose a novel deep learning model based on
frequency-domain analysis to enhance the accuracy of coronary artery
segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA, thereby offering robust support for
the stenosis detection and treatment of CAD. Methods: We propose the
Frequency-Domain Attention-Guided Diffusion Network (FAD-Net), which integrates
a frequency-domain-based attention mechanism and a cascading diffusion strategy
to fully exploit frequency-domain information for improved segmentation
accuracy. Specifically, FAD-Net employs a Multi-Level Self-Attention (MLSA)
mechanism in the frequency domain, computing the similarity between queries and
keys across high- and low-frequency components in ICAs. Furthermore, a
Low-Frequency Diffusion Module (LFDM) is incorporated to decompose ICAs into
low- and high-frequency components via multi-level wavelet transformation.
Subsequently, it refines fine-grained arterial branches and edges by
reintegrating high-frequency details via inverse fusion, enabling continuous
enhancement of anatomical precision. Results and Conclusions: Extensive
experiments demonstrate that FAD-Net achieves a mean Dice coefficient of 0.8717
in coronary artery segmentation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art
methods. In addition, it attains a true positive rate of 0.6140 and a positive
predictive value of 0.6398 in stenosis detection, underscoring its clinical
applicability. These findings suggest that FAD-Net holds significant potential
to assist in the accurate diagnosis and treatment planning of CAD.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Stable Diffusion的CT盲超分辨率框架，结合退化模型和视觉语言模型生成描述，显著提升图像质量并减少辐射剂量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率CT成像对诊断至关重要，但高辐射剂量存在安全隐患。现有深度学习方法在复杂退化和有限数据下表现不佳，而预训练扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）在细节合成方面表现出色。

Method: 使用退化模型合成低质量图像，结合预训练视觉语言模型生成描述，利用Stable Diffusion进行超分辨率重建，并通过控制策略结合低分辨率输入和文本描述。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有方法，能在低辐射剂量下实现高质量CT成像。

Conclusion: 该方法为CT超分辨率提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力，代码将公开。

Abstract: High-resolution computed tomography (CT) imaging is essential for medical
diagnosis but requires increased radiation exposure, creating a critical
trade-off between image quality and patient safety. While deep learning methods
have shown promise in CT super-resolution, they face challenges with complex
degradations and limited medical training data. Meanwhile, large-scale
pre-trained diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in synthesizing fine details across various vision
tasks. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework that adapts Stable
Diffusion for CT blind super-resolution. We employ a practical degradation
model to synthesize realistic low-quality images and leverage a pre-trained
vision-language model to generate corresponding descriptions. Subsequently, we
perform super-resolution using Stable Diffusion with a specialized controlling
strategy, conditioned on both low-resolution inputs and the generated text
descriptions. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing
approaches, demonstrating its potential for achieving high-quality CT imaging
at reduced radiation doses. Our code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效且可扩展的视频超分辨率方法，通过压缩驱动的降维策略减少计算复杂度并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频超分辨率模型存在推理时间长、训练复杂及依赖辅助信息等问题，无法满足高帧率视频的需求。

Method: 借鉴高光谱图像与视频数据的相似性，采用压缩驱动的降维策略，设计模块化架构以兼容现有框架。

Result: 实验表明，该方法性能与或优于当前SOTA模型，同时显著减少推理时间。

Conclusion: 该方法为视频超分辨率技术提供了一种实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) compressed video super-resolution (CVSR) models face
persistent challenges, including prolonged inference time, complex training
pipelines, and reliance on auxiliary information. As video frame rates continue
to increase, the diminishing inter-frame differences further expose the
limitations of traditional frame-to-frame information exploitation methods,
which are inadequate for addressing current video super-resolution (VSR)
demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient and scalable
solution inspired by the structural and statistical similarities between
hyperspectral images (HSI) and video data. Our approach introduces a
compression-driven dimensionality reduction strategy that reduces computational
complexity, accelerates inference, and enhances the extraction of temporal
information across frames. The proposed modular architecture is designed for
seamless integration with existing VSR frameworks, ensuring strong adaptability
and transferability across diverse applications. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves performance on par with, or surpassing,
the current SOTA models, while significantly reducing inference time. By
addressing key bottlenecks in CVSR, our work offers a practical and efficient
pathway for advancing VSR technology. Our code will be publicly available at

Result: 实验表明，该模型在脑疾病诊断中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该模型为脑网络分析研究提供了有前景的新方法。

Abstract: Functional brain network analysis has become an indispensable tool for brain
disease analysis. It is profoundly impacted by deep learning methods, which can
characterize complex connections between ROIs. However, the research on
foundation models of brain network is limited and constrained to a single
dimension, which restricts their extensive application in neuroscience. In this
study, we propose a fine-tuned brain network model for brain disease diagnosis.
It expands brain region representations across multiple dimensions based on the
original brain network model, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Our model
consists of two key modules: (1)an adapter module that expands brain region
features across different dimensions. (2)a fine-tuned foundation brain network
model, based on self-supervised learning and pre-trained on fMRI data from
thousands of participants. Specifically, its transformer block is able to
effectively extract brain region features and compute the inter-region
associations. Moreover, we derive a compact latent representation of the brain
network for brain disease diagnosis. Our downstream experiments in this study
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance in brain
disease diagnosis, which potentially offers a promising approach in brain
network analysis research.

Motivation: 医学影像中神经网络模型的应用受到隐私法规、数据稀缺、高成本和人口偏见的限制。深度生成模型能生成合成数据以解决这些问题，但需要验证其形态和临床准确性。

Method: 研究比较了基于深度特征的损失函数与感知损失和边缘检测损失函数的效果，使用广泛的验证流程评估合成图像的质量。

Result: 研究发现，基于边缘检测的损失函数在提升血管结构清晰度方面表现更优，而基于深度特征的损失函数未显著改善图像生成效果。

Conclusion: 研究强调了传统边缘检测方法在医学影像合成中的有效性，尤其是在视网膜成像中提升血管结构清晰度方面。

Abstract: The adoption of neural network models in medical imaging has been constrained
by strict privacy regulations, limited data availability, high acquisition
costs, and demographic biases. Deep generative models offer a promising
solution by generating synthetic data that bypasses privacy concerns and
addresses fairness by producing samples for under-represented groups. However,
unlike natural images, medical imaging requires validation not only for
fidelity (e.g., Fr\'echet Inception Score) but also for morphological and
clinical accuracy. This is particularly true for colour fundus retinal imaging,
which requires precise replication of the retinal vascular network, including
vessel topology, continuity, and thickness. In this study, we in-vestigated
whether a distance-based loss function based on deep activation layers of a
large foundational model trained on large corpus of domain data, colour fundus
imaging, offers advantages over a perceptual loss and edge-detection based loss
functions. Our extensive validation pipeline, based on both domain-free and
domain specific tasks, suggests that domain-specific deep features do not
improve autoen-coder image generation. Conversely, our findings highlight the
effectiveness of con-ventional edge detection filters in improving the
sharpness of vascular structures in synthetic samples.

Motivation: 肌肉骨骼疾病（MSDs）是全球残疾的主要原因，需要先进的诊断和治疗工具进行个性化评估和治疗。数字孪生（DT）范式因其能整合异构数据源而成为有效选择。

Method: MS-DT框架整合了运动捕捉、超声成像、肌电图和医学影像等多源数据，通过计算建模创建患者特定的肌肉骨骼系统模型，并提供交互式可视化平台。

Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are a leading cause of disability worldwide,
requiring advanced diagnostic and therapeutic tools for personalised assessment
and treatment. Effective management of MSDs involves the interaction of
heterogeneous data sources, making the Digital Twin (DT) paradigm a valuable
option. This paper introduces the Musculoskeletal Digital Twin (MS-DT), a novel
framework that integrates multiscale biomechanical data with computational
modelling to create a detailed, patient-specific representation of the
musculoskeletal system. By combining motion capture, ultrasound imaging,
electromyography, and medical imaging, the MS-DT enables the analysis of spinal
kinematics, posture, and muscle function. An interactive visualisation platform
provides clinicians and researchers with an intuitive interface for exploring
biomechanical parameters and tracking patient-specific changes. Results
demonstrate the effectiveness of MS-DT in extracting precise kinematic and
dynamic tissue features, offering a comprehensive tool for monitoring spine
biomechanics and rehabilitation. This framework provides high-fidelity
modelling and real-time visualization to improve patient-specific diagnosis and
intervention planning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于结构相似性展开的高效图像超分辨率方法（SSIU），结合数据驱动和模型驱动的优势，通过模块化设计提升性能并保持模型紧凑性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据驱动的超分辨率方法通常通过增加网络深度或使用注意力机制来扩展感受野，但增加了模型复杂度。模型驱动的展开方法在保持紧凑性的同时提升性能，因此提出结合两者的SSIU方法。

Method: 设计了基于结构相似性约束的展开优化函数，包含混合尺度门控模块（MSGM）和高效稀疏注意力模块（ESAM），并引入基于专家混合的特征选择器（MoE-FS）利用多级特征。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在性能和效率上优于当前最优模型，参数更少且内存消耗更低。

Conclusion: SSIU方法通过结合数据驱动和模型驱动的优势，实现了高效且高性能的图像超分辨率。

Abstract: Major efforts in data-driven image super-resolution (SR) primarily focus on
expanding the receptive field of the model to better capture contextual
information. However, these methods are typically implemented by stacking
deeper networks or leveraging transformer-based attention mechanisms, which
consequently increases model complexity. In contrast, model-driven methods
based on the unfolding paradigm show promise in improving performance while
effectively maintaining model compactness through sophisticated module design.
Based on these insights, we propose a Structural Similarity-Inspired Unfolding
(SSIU) method for efficient image SR. This method is designed through unfolding
an SR optimization function constrained by structural similarity, aiming to
combine the strengths of both data-driven and model-driven approaches. Our
model operates progressively following the unfolding paradigm. Each iteration
consists of multiple Mixed-Scale Gating Modules (MSGM) and an Efficient Sparse
Attention Module (ESAM). The former implements comprehensive constraints on
features, including a structural similarity constraint, while the latter aims
to achieve sparse activation. In addition, we design a Mixture-of-Experts-based
Feature Selector (MoE-FS) that fully utilizes multi-level feature information
by combining features from different steps. Extensive experiments validate the
efficacy and efficiency of our unfolding-inspired network. Our model
outperforms current state-of-the-art models, boasting lower parameter counts
and reduced memory consumption. Our code will be available at:

Motivation: 开发一种高效且适用于多模态头部图像的颅骨剥离模型，以降低计算资源需求并提升性能。

Method: 基于频谱解释的扩张卷积架构，使用模态无关的合成数据进行训练。

Result: 在606例多模态脑部扫描中，MindGrab平均Dice得分为95.9，显著优于ROBEX和BET，与SynthStrip性能相当但参数减少95%。

Conclusion: MindGrab在保持高性能的同时显著降低了资源需求，适用于更广泛的硬件环境。

Abstract: We developed MindGrab, a parameter- and memory-efficient deep
fully-convolutional model for volumetric skull-stripping in head images of any
modality. Its architecture, informed by a spectral interpretation of dilated
convolutions, was trained exclusively on modality-agnostic synthetic data.
MindGrab was evaluated on a retrospective dataset of 606 multimodal adult-brain
scans (T1, T2, DWI, MRA, PDw MRI, EPI, CT, PET) sourced from the SynthStrip
dataset. Performance was benchmarked against SynthStrip, ROBEX, and BET using
Dice scores, with Wilcoxon signed-rank significance tests. MindGrab achieved a
mean Dice score of 95.9 with standard deviation (SD) 1.6 across modalities,
significantly outperforming classical methods (ROBEX: 89.1 SD 7.7, P < 0.05;
BET: 85.2 SD 14.4, P < 0.05). Compared to SynthStrip (96.5 SD 1.1, P=0.0352),
MindGrab delivered equivalent or superior performance in nearly half of the
tested scenarios, with minor differences (<3% Dice) in the others. MindGrab
utilized 95% fewer parameters (146,237 vs. 2,566,561) than SynthStrip. This
efficiency yielded at least 2x faster inference, 50% lower memory usage on
GPUs, and enabled exceptional performance (e.g., 10-30x speedup, and up to 30x
memory reduction) and accessibility on a wider range of hardware, including
systems without high-end GPUs. MindGrab delivers state-of-the-art accuracy with
dramatically lower resource demands, supported in brainchop-cli

TL;DR: crossMoDA挑战系列聚焦于无监督跨模态分割，从ceT1 MRI迁移到T2 MRI，旨在自动化VS和耳蜗分割。挑战目标逐年演进，数据集扩大减少了异常值，但2023年耳蜗分割性能下降。

Motivation: 通过跨模态分割挑战推动临床应用中VS和耳蜗的自动化分割，降低成本并提高效率。

Result: 数据集扩大减少了异常值，但2023年耳蜗Dice分数下降；2023年获胜方法在早期测试数据上表现更优。

Conclusion: 尽管进展显著，仍需提升VS分割性能，未来可能需要更具挑战性的跨模态任务。

Abstract: The cross-Modality Domain Adaptation (crossMoDA) challenge series, initiated
in 2021 in conjunction with the International Conference on Medical Image
Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), focuses on unsupervised
cross-modality segmentation, learning from contrast-enhanced T1 (ceT1) and
transferring to T2 MRI. The task is an extreme example of domain shift chosen
to serve as a meaningful and illustrative benchmark. From a clinical
application perspective, it aims to automate Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) and
cochlea segmentation on T2 scans for more cost-effective VS management. Over
time, the challenge objectives have evolved to enhance its clinical relevance.
The challenge evolved from using single-institutional data and basic
segmentation in 2021 to incorporating multi-institutional data and Koos grading
in 2022, and by 2023, it included heterogeneous routine data and
sub-segmentation of intra- and extra-meatal tumour components. In this work, we
report the findings of the 2022 and 2023 editions and perform a retrospective
analysis of the challenge progression over the years. The observations from the
successive challenge contributions indicate that the number of outliers
decreases with an expanding dataset. This is notable since the diversity of
scanning protocols of the datasets concurrently increased. The winning approach
of the 2023 edition reduced the number of outliers on the 2021 and 2022 testing
data, demonstrating how increased data heterogeneity can enhance segmentation
performance even on homogeneous data. However, the cochlea Dice score declined
in 2023, likely due to the added complexity from tumour sub-annotations
affecting overall segmentation performance. While progress is still needed for
clinically acceptable VS segmentation, the plateauing performance suggests that
a more challenging cross-modal task may better serve future benchmarking.

Motivation: 由于年轻癫痫患者对辐射剂量的敏感性，需要开发一种能从MRI或极低剂量PET合成高质量PET图像的方法。

Method: 研究比较了两种基于分数的生成扩散模型（SGM-KD和SGM-VP）和Transformer-Unet模型在52名受试者中的表现，评估了图像质量和临床相关指标。

Result: SGM-KD在纯MRI输入时表现最佳，加入1%低剂量PET后所有模型性能显著提升且表现相近。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在纯MRI到PET转换中潜力巨大，而所有模型均可结合MRI和极低剂量PET准确合成全剂量FDG-PET图像。

Abstract: Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET to evaluate patients with epilepsy is one of the
most common applications for simultaneous PET/MRI, given the need to image both
brain structure and metabolism, but is suboptimal due to the radiation dose in
this young population. Little work has been done synthesizing diagnostic
quality PET images from MRI data or MRI data with ultralow-dose PET using
advanced generative AI methods, such as diffusion models, with attention to
clinical evaluations tailored for the epilepsy population. Here we compared the
performance of diffusion- and non-diffusion-based deep learning models for the
MRI-to-PET image translation task for epilepsy imaging using simultaneous
PET/MRI in 52 subjects (40 train/2 validate/10 hold-out test). We tested three
different models: 2 score-based generative diffusion models (SGM-Karras
Diffusion [SGM-KD] and SGM-variance preserving [SGM-VP]) and a
Transformer-Unet. We report results on standard image processing metrics as
well as clinically relevant metrics, including congruency measures (Congruence
Index and Congruency Mean Absolute Error) that assess hemispheric metabolic
asymmetry, which is a key part of the clinical analysis of these images. The
SGM-KD produced the best qualitative and quantitative results when synthesizing
PET purely from T1w and T2 FLAIR images with the least mean absolute error in
whole-brain specific uptake value ratio (SUVR) and highest intraclass
correlation coefficient. When 1% low-dose PET images are included in the
inputs, all models improve significantly and are interchangeable for
quantitative performance and visual quality. In summary, SGMs hold great
potential for pure MRI-to-PET translation, while all 3 model types can
synthesize full-dose FDG-PET accurately using MRI and ultralow-dose PET.

Conclusion: 建议在教育和职业培训中平衡AI使用，以培养强健的内部认知模型。

Abstract: In the age of generative AI and ubiquitous digital tools, human cognition
faces a structural paradox: as external aids become more capable, internal
memory systems risk atrophy. Drawing on neuroscience and cognitive psychology,
this paper examines how heavy reliance on AI systems and discovery-based
pedagogies may impair the consolidation of declarative and procedural memory --
systems essential for expertise, critical thinking, and long-term retention. We
review how tools like ChatGPT and calculators can short-circuit the retrieval,
error correction, and schema-building processes necessary for robust neural
encoding. Notably, we highlight striking parallels between deep learning
phenomena such as "grokking" and the neuroscience of overlearning and
intuition. Empirical studies are discussed showing how premature reliance on AI
during learning inhibits proceduralization and intuitive mastery. We argue that
effective human-AI interaction depends on strong internal models -- biological
"schemata" and neural manifolds -- that enable users to evaluate, refine, and
guide AI output. The paper concludes with policy implications for education and
workforce training in the age of large language models.

Conclusion: 专有基础模型是前瞻性医疗组织的核心能力，为决策提供框架。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the strategic imperative for
healthcare organizations to develop proprietary foundation models rather than
relying exclusively on commercial alternatives. We examine four fundamental
considerations driving this imperative: the domain-specific requirements of
healthcare data representation, critical data sovereignty and governance
considerations unique to healthcare, strategic competitive advantages afforded
by proprietary AI infrastructure, and the transformative potential of
healthcare-specific foundation models for patient care and organizational
operations. Through analysis of empirical evidence, economic frameworks, and
organizational case studies, we demonstrate that proprietary multimodal
foundation models enable healthcare organizations to achieve superior clinical
performance, maintain robust data governance, create sustainable competitive
advantages, and accelerate innovation pathways. While acknowledging
implementation challenges, we present evidence showing organizations with
proprietary AI capabilities demonstrate measurably improved outcomes, faster
innovation cycles, and stronger strategic positioning in the evolving
healthcare ecosystem. This analysis provides healthcare leaders with a
comprehensive framework for evaluating build-versus-buy decisions regarding
foundation model implementation, positioning proprietary foundation model
development as a cornerstone capability for forward-thinking healthcare
organizations.

potential development of AI systems with subjective experience and how such
systems should be treated and governed. When asked to estimate the chances that
such systems will exist on specific dates, the median responses were 1% (AI
researchers) and 5% (public) by 2024, 25% and 30% by 2034, and 70% and 60% by
2100, respectively. The median member of the public thought there was a higher
chance that AI systems with subjective experience would never exist (25%) than
the median AI researcher did (10%). Both groups perceived a need for
multidisciplinary expertise to assess AI subjective experience. Although
support for welfare protections for such AI systems exceeded opposition, it
remained far lower than support for protections for animals or the environment.
Attitudes toward moral and governance issues were divided in both groups,
especially regarding whether such systems should be created and what rights or
protections they should receive. Yet a majority of respondents in both groups
agreed that safeguards against the potential risks from AI systems with
subjective experience should be implemented by AI developers now, and if
created, AI systems with subjective experience should treat others well, behave
ethically, and be held accountable. Overall, these results suggest that both AI
researchers and the public regard the emergence of AI systems with subjective
experience as a possibility this century, though substantial uncertainty and
disagreement remain about the timeline and appropriate response.
