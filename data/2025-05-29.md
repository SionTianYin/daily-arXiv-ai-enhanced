### [1] [More Thinking, Less Seeing? Assessing Amplified Hallucination in Multimodal Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21523)
*Chengzhi Liu,Zhongxing Xu,Qingyue Wei,Juncheng Wu,James Zou,Xin Eric Wang,Yuyin Zhou,Sheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了多模态大语言模型在长推理链中视觉基础减弱导致的幻觉问题，提出了RH-AUC指标和RH-Bench基准，发现模型大小和训练数据类型对推理与感知平衡的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在长推理链中表现优异，但伴随视觉基础减弱和幻觉增加的问题，需系统研究。

Method: 引入RH-AUC量化模型感知准确性随推理长度的变化，并发布RH-Bench基准评估推理与幻觉的权衡。

Result: 大模型在推理与感知平衡上表现更好，且平衡受训练数据类型影响大于数据量。

Conclusion: 需联合评估推理质量和感知保真度，模型设计和训练数据选择是关键。

Abstract: Test-time compute has empowered multimodal large language models to generate
extended reasoning chains, yielding strong performance on tasks such as
multimodal math reasoning. However, this improved reasoning ability often comes
with increased hallucination: as generations become longer, models tend to
drift away from image-grounded content and rely more heavily on language
priors. Attention analysis shows that longer reasoning chains lead to reduced
focus on visual inputs, which contributes to hallucination. To systematically
study this phenomenon, we introduce RH-AUC, a metric that quantifies how a
model's perception accuracy changes with reasoning length, allowing us to
evaluate whether the model preserves visual grounding during reasoning. We also
release RH-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark that spans a variety of multimodal
tasks, designed to assess the trade-off between reasoning ability and
hallucination. Our analysis reveals that (i) larger models typically achieve a
better balance between reasoning and perception, and (ii) this balance is
influenced more by the types and domains of training data than by its overall
volume. These findings underscore the importance of evaluation frameworks that
jointly consider both reasoning quality and perceptual fidelity.

### [2] [Loquacious Set: 25,000 Hours of Transcribed and Diverse English Speech Recognition Data for Research and Commercial Use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21578)
*Titouan Parcollet,Yuan Tseng,Shucong Zhang,Rogier van Dalen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Loquacious Set是一个25,000小时的商用英语语音数据集，解决了现有ASR数据集的局限性，适用于学术界和工业界研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASR数据集（如LibriSpeech）在规模和多样性上不足，且其他新数据集存在许可、转录质量等问题，无法满足工业界和学术界的需求。

Method: 提出了Loquacious Set，一个包含多样口音和语音类型的25,000小时商用英语语音数据集。

Result: Loquacious Set为构建真实场景下的ASR系统提供了高质量、多样化的数据支持。

Conclusion: Loquacious Set填补了现有ASR数据集的不足，为学术界和工业界提供了实用的研究工具。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) research is driven by the availability of
common datasets between industrial researchers and academics, encouraging
comparisons and evaluations. LibriSpeech, despite its long success as an ASR
benchmark, is now limited by its size and focus on clean, read speech, leading
to near-zero word error rates. More recent datasets, including MOSEL, YODAS,
Gigaspeech, OWSM, Libriheavy or People's Speech suffer from major limitations
including licenses that researchers in the industry cannot use, unreliable
transcriptions, incorrect audio data, or the lack of evaluation sets. This work
presents the Loquacious Set, a 25,000-hour curated collection of commercially
usable English speech. Featuring hundreds of thousands of speakers with diverse
accents and a wide range of speech types (read, spontaneous, talks, clean,
noisy), the Loquacious Set is designed to work for academics and researchers in
the industry to build ASR systems in real-world scenarios.

### [3] [Rethinking Data Mixture for Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey and New Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21598)
*Yajiao Liu,Congliang Chen,Junchi Yang,Ruoyu Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文综述了数据混合方法，提出了细粒度分类，总结了离线与在线方法的子类型及其优缺点，并讨论了该领域的关键挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在固定训练预算下，如何确定不同数据域的采样比例以优化模型性能是一个关键问题。

Method: 提出离线方法（启发式、算法、函数拟合）和在线方法（在线极小极大优化、在线混合法则等）的细粒度分类，并总结问题表述和代表性算法。

Result: 明确了离线与在线方法的关系与区别，总结了各类方法的优缺点。

Conclusion: 数据混合领域的关键挑战包括方法选择与性能优化，未来需进一步研究。

Abstract: Training large language models with data collected from various domains can
improve their performance on downstream tasks. However, given a fixed training
budget, the sampling proportions of these different domains significantly
impact the model's performance. How can we determine the domain weights across
different data domains to train the best-performing model within constrained
computational resources? In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of
existing data mixture methods. First, we propose a fine-grained categorization
of existing methods, extending beyond the previous offline and online
classification. Offline methods are further grouped into heuristic-based,
algorithm-based, and function fitting-based methods. For online methods, we
categorize them into three groups: online min-max optimization, online mixing
law, and other approaches by drawing connections with the optimization
frameworks underlying offline methods. Second, we summarize the problem
formulations, representative algorithms for each subtype of offline and online
methods, and clarify the relationships and distinctions among them. Finally, we
discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method and highlight key
challenges in the field of data mixture.

### [4] [R2R: Efficiently Navigating Divergent Reasoning Paths with Small-Large Model Token Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21600)
*Tianyu Fu,Yi Ge,Yichen You,Enshu Liu,Zhihang Yuan,Guohao Dai,Shengen Yan,Huazhong Yang,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为R2R的神经令牌路由方法，通过选择性使用大语言模型（LLMs）处理关键路径分歧令牌，显著提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）推理成本高，而小语言模型（SLMs）效率高但性能不足，无法完全遵循LLMs的推理路径。

Method: 提出R2R方法，通过识别关键路径分歧令牌并训练轻量级路由器，选择性使用LLMs处理这些令牌，其余由SLM处理。

Result: R2R在平均激活参数5.6B的情况下，性能超越R1-7B模型1.6倍，甚至优于R1-14B模型，同时比R1-32B提速2.8倍。

Conclusion: R2R显著提升了推理效率与性能的平衡，推动了测试时扩展效率的Pareto前沿。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve impressive reasoning capabilities at the
cost of substantial inference overhead, posing substantial deployment
challenges. Although distilled Small Language Models (SLMs) significantly
enhance efficiency, their performance suffers as they fail to follow LLMs'
reasoning paths. Luckily, we reveal that only a small fraction of tokens
genuinely diverge reasoning paths between LLMs and SLMs. Most generated tokens
are either identical or exhibit neutral differences, such as minor variations
in abbreviations or expressions. Leveraging this insight, we introduce **Roads
to Rome (R2R)**, a neural token routing method that selectively utilizes LLMs
only for these critical, path-divergent tokens, while leaving the majority of
token generation to the SLM. We also develop an automatic data generation
pipeline that identifies divergent tokens and generates token-level routing
labels to train the lightweight router. We apply R2R to combine R1-1.5B and
R1-32B models from the DeepSeek family, and evaluate on challenging math,
coding, and QA benchmarks. With an average activated parameter size of 5.6B,
R2R surpasses the average accuracy of R1-7B by 1.6x, outperforming even the
R1-14B model. Compared to R1-32B, it delivers a 2.8x wall-clock speedup with
comparable performance, advancing the Pareto frontier of test-time scaling
efficiency. Our code is available at https://github.com/thu-nics/R2R.

### [5] [How does Misinformation Affect Large Language Model Behaviors and Preferences?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21608)
*Miao Peng,Nuo Chen,Jianheng Tang,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了MisBench，一个评估大语言模型（LLM）对错误信息行为的全面基准，并揭示了LLM在知识冲突和风格变化中的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对LLM在错误信息中具体影响的细粒度分析，MisBench旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 构建包含10,346,712条错误信息的MisBench基准，结合知识冲突和风格变化，并提出Reconstruct to Discriminate（RtD）方法。

Result: LLM在识别错误信息方面表现相当，但仍易受知识冲突和风格变化影响。RtD方法能增强LLM检测错误信息的能力。

Conclusion: MisBench为评估LLM与错误信息的交互提供了有效基准，并提升了其在现实应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in
knowledge-intensive tasks, while they remain vulnerable when encountering
misinformation. Existing studies have explored the role of LLMs in combating
misinformation, but there is still a lack of fine-grained analysis on the
specific aspects and extent to which LLMs are influenced by misinformation. To
bridge this gap, we present MisBench, the current largest and most
comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs' behavior and knowledge preference
toward misinformation. MisBench consists of 10,346,712 pieces of
misinformation, which uniquely considers both knowledge-based conflicts and
stylistic variations in misinformation. Empirical results reveal that while
LLMs demonstrate comparable abilities in discerning misinformation, they still
remain susceptible to knowledge conflicts and stylistic variations. Based on
these findings, we further propose a novel approach called Reconstruct to
Discriminate (RtD) to strengthen LLMs' ability to detect misinformation. Our
study provides valuable insights into LLMs' interactions with misinformation,
and we believe MisBench can serve as an effective benchmark for evaluating
LLM-based detectors and enhancing their reliability in real-world applications.

### [6] [Iterative Corpus Refinement for Materials Property Prediction Based on Scientific Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21646)
*Lei Zhang,Markus Stricker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种迭代框架，通过选择多样化的文档、训练Word2Vec模型，并监测嵌入空间中成分-属性相关性的收敛，加速材料发现与优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 材料发现中的组合爆炸问题导致数据稀缺，需要充分利用所有可能的数据源，包括科学文本中的潜在知识。

Method: 采用迭代框架，结合多样化文档选择、Word2Vec模型训练和嵌入空间相关性监测，预测高性能材料。

Result: 成功预测了氧还原、氢析出和氧析出反应中的高性能材料，并通过实验验证。

Conclusion: 迭代语料库优化方法为材料发现提供了高效、可扩展的工具，尤其在数据稀缺的情况下。

Abstract: The discovery and optimization of materials for specific applications is
hampered by the practically infinite number of possible elemental combinations
and associated properties, also known as the `combinatorial explosion'. By
nature of the problem, data are scarce and all possible data sources should be
used. In addition to simulations and experimental results, the latent knowledge
in scientific texts is not yet used to its full potential. We present an
iterative framework that refines a given scientific corpus by strategic
selection of the most diverse documents, training Word2Vec models, and
monitoring the convergence of composition-property correlations in embedding
space. Our approach is applied to predict high-performing materials for oxygen
reduction (ORR), hydrogen evolution (HER), and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions
for a large number of possible candidate compositions. Our method successfully
predicts the highest performing compositions among a large pool of candidates,
validated by experimental measurements of the electrocatalytic performance in
the lab. This work demonstrates and validates the potential of iterative corpus
refinement to accelerate materials discovery and optimization, offering a
scalable and efficient tool for screening large compositional spaces where
reliable data are scarce or non-existent.

### [7] [Explainability of Large Language Models using SMILE: Statistical Model-agnostic Interpretability with Local Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21657)
*Zeinab Dehghani,Koorosh Aslansefat,Adil Khan,Mohammed Naveed Akram*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SMILE是一种新方法，用于解释大型语言模型如何响应提示的不同部分，通过可视化热图展示关键词语，提高模型透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（如GPT、LLAMA等）的决策过程不透明，在需要信任和问责的领域可能存在问题。

Method: SMILE通过微调输入并测量输出变化，识别对输出影响最大的词语，生成可视化热图。

Result: 在多个主流LLM上测试，SMILE在准确性、一致性、稳定性和保真度方面表现良好。

Conclusion: SMILE提升了AI模型的透明度和可信度，是迈向可解释AI的重要一步。

Abstract: Large language models like GPT, LLAMA, and Claude have become incredibly
powerful at generating text, but they are still black boxes, so it is hard to
understand how they decide what to say. That lack of transparency can be
problematic, especially in fields where trust and accountability matter. To
help with this, we introduce SMILE, a new method that explains how these models
respond to different parts of a prompt. SMILE is model-agnostic and works by
slightly changing the input, measuring how the output changes, and then
highlighting which words had the most impact. Create simple visual heat maps
showing which parts of a prompt matter the most. We tested SMILE on several
leading LLMs and used metrics such as accuracy, consistency, stability, and
fidelity to show that it gives clear and reliable explanations. By making these
models easier to understand, SMILE brings us one step closer to making AI more
transparent and trustworthy.

### [8] [Rethinking the Outlier Distribution in Large Language Models: An In-depth Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21670)
*Rahul Raman,Khushi Sharma,Sai Qian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）中的异常值，探讨其形成机制并提出消除策略，以提升量化效率和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异常值对LLMs的量化性能影响显著，导致误差和性能下降，需深入探究其成因并找到解决方案。

Method: 全面调查异常值的形成机制，并提出消除大规模激活和通道异常值的有效方法。

Result: 提出了高效消除异常值的策略，对模型精度影响最小。

Conclusion: 通过解决异常值问题，可显著提升LLMs的量化效率和部署效果。

Abstract: Investigating outliers in large language models (LLMs) is crucial due to
their significant impact on various aspects of LLM performance, including
quantization and compression. Outliers often cause considerable quantization
errors, leading to degraded model performance. Identifying and addressing these
outliers can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the quantization process,
enabling smoother deployment on edge devices or specialized hardware. Recent
studies have identified two common types of outliers in LLMs: massive
activations and channel-wise outliers. While numerous quantization algorithms
have been proposed to mitigate their effects and maintain satisfactory
accuracy, few have thoroughly explored the root causes of these outliers in
depth. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the
formation mechanisms of these outliers and propose potential strategies to
mitigate their occurrence. Ultimately, we introduce some efficient approaches
to eliminate most massive activations and channel-wise outliers with minimal
impact on accuracy.

### [9] [LLMPR: A Novel LLM-Driven Transfer Learning based Petition Ranking Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21689)
*Avijit Gayen,Somyajit Chakraborty,Mainak Sen,Soham Paul,Angshuman Jana*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出LLMPR框架，利用大语言模型和机器学习自动为法律请愿书分配优先级，显著提高司法效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度司法系统中未解决案件的积累导致司法延误，手动优先级分配效率低且存在主观偏见。

Method: 使用ILDC数据集，结合文本嵌入（如DistilBERT）和定量指标训练多种机器学习模型（如随机森林）。

Result: 随机森林和决策树模型表现最佳，准确率超99%，Spearman秩相关0.99。数值特征已接近最优效果。

Conclusion: 自动化请愿书排名可优化司法流程，减少案件积压，提升公平性。

Abstract: The persistent accumulation of unresolved legal cases, especially within the
Indian judiciary, significantly hampers the timely delivery of justice. Manual
methods of prioritizing petitions are often prone to inefficiencies and
subjective biases further exacerbating delays. To address this issue, we
propose LLMPR (Large Language Model-based Petition Ranking), an automated
framework that utilizes transfer learning and machine learning to assign
priority rankings to legal petitions based on their contextual urgency.
Leveraging the ILDC dataset comprising 7,593 annotated petitions, we process
unstructured legal text and extract features through various embedding
techniques, including DistilBERT, LegalBERT, and MiniLM. These textual
embeddings are combined with quantitative indicators such as gap days, rank
scores, and word counts to train multiple machine learning models, including
Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. Our experiments
demonstrate that Random Forest and Decision Tree models yield superior
performance, with accuracy exceeding 99% and a Spearman rank correlation of
0.99. Notably, models using only numerical features achieve nearly optimal
ranking results (R2 = 0.988, \r{ho} = 0.998), while LLM-based embeddings offer
only marginal gains. These findings suggest that automated petition ranking can
effectively streamline judicial workflows, reduce case backlog, and improve
fairness in legal prioritization.

### [10] [MAKIEval: A Multilingual Automatic WiKidata-based Framework for Cultural Awareness Evaluation for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21693)
*Raoyuan Zhao,Beiduo Chen,Barbara Plank,Michael A. Hedderich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAKIEval是一个自动多语言框架，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在不同语言、地区和主题中的文化意识，解决了现有评估方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs的英语中心预训练可能导致跨语言文化偏见，而现有多语言评估方法受限于基准和翻译质量，因此需要一种更全面的评估工具。

Method: MAKIEval利用Wikidata的多语言结构作为跨语言锚点，自动识别模型输出中的文化实体并链接到结构化知识，无需人工标注或翻译。

Result: 评估了7个LLMs在13种语言、19个国家和地区、6个文化主题上的表现，发现模型在英语中表现更强的文化意识。

Conclusion: MAKIEval为评估LLMs的文化意识提供了可扩展且语言无关的方法，揭示了英语提示更有效激活文化知识的现象。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are used globally across many languages, but
their English-centric pretraining raises concerns about cross-lingual
disparities for cultural awareness, often resulting in biased outputs. However,
comprehensive multilingual evaluation remains challenging due to limited
benchmarks and questionable translation quality. To better assess these
disparities, we introduce MAKIEval, an automatic multilingual framework for
evaluating cultural awareness in LLMs across languages, regions, and topics.
MAKIEval evaluates open-ended text generation, capturing how models express
culturally grounded knowledge in natural language. Leveraging Wikidata's
multilingual structure as a cross-lingual anchor, it automatically identifies
cultural entities in model outputs and links them to structured knowledge,
enabling scalable, language-agnostic evaluation without manual annotation or
translation. We then introduce four metrics that capture complementary
dimensions of cultural awareness: granularity, diversity, cultural specificity,
and consensus across languages. We assess 7 LLMs developed from different parts
of the world, encompassing both open-source and proprietary systems, across 13
languages, 19 countries and regions, and 6 culturally salient topics (e.g.,
food, clothing). Notably, we find that models tend to exhibit stronger cultural
awareness in English, suggesting that English prompts more effectively activate
culturally grounded knowledge. We publicly release our code and data.

### [11] [Do We Know What LLMs Don't Know? A Study of Consistency in Knowledge Probing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21701)
*Raoyuan Zhao,Abdullatif Köksal,Ali Modarressi,Michael A. Hedderich,Hinrich Schütze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于输入变化和定量指标的新方法，评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）知识缺口探测的不一致性，揭示了探测方法在内部和跨方法上的显著不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的幻觉问题严重影响了其可靠性，因此需要精确识别其知识缺口。

Method: 通过输入变化和定量指标，评估不同知识缺口探测方法的一致性。

Result: 发现探测方法存在内部不一致（如提示微小变化导致检测结果差异）和跨方法不一致（不同方法对同一问题的判断矛盾）。

Conclusion: 现有探测方法存在显著问题，亟需开发更具鲁棒性的探测框架。

Abstract: The reliability of large language models (LLMs) is greatly compromised by
their tendency to hallucinate, underscoring the need for precise identification
of knowledge gaps within LLMs. Various methods for probing such gaps exist,
ranging from calibration-based to prompting-based methods. To evaluate these
probing methods, in this paper, we propose a new process based on using input
variations and quantitative metrics. Through this, we expose two dimensions of
inconsistency in knowledge gap probing. (1) Intra-method inconsistency: Minimal
non-semantic perturbations in prompts lead to considerable variance in detected
knowledge gaps within the same probing method; e.g., the simple variation of
shuffling answer options can decrease agreement to around 40%. (2) Cross-method
inconsistency: Probing methods contradict each other on whether a model knows
the answer. Methods are highly inconsistent -- with decision consistency across
methods being as low as 7% -- even though the model, dataset, and prompt are
all the same. These findings challenge existing probing methods and highlight
the urgent need for perturbation-robust probing frameworks.

*Barbarestani Baran,Maks Isa,Vossen Piek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了ChatGPT在识别在线评论中的目标和不当语言方面的有效性，发现其在检测不当内容方面表现良好，但在目标语言检测上存在变异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体上用户生成内容的大量增加，AI在内容审核中的作用日益重要，本研究旨在评估ChatGPT在此领域的表现。

Method: 通过将ChatGPT的性能与众包注释和专家评估进行比较，评估其准确性、检测范围和一致性。

Result: ChatGPT在检测不当内容方面表现良好，但在目标语言检测上存在较高的假阳性率。

Conclusion: 研究展示了ChatGPT在自动化内容审核中的潜力，同时指出了需要进一步改进的领域，强调了模型持续优化和上下文理解的重要性。

Abstract: This study evaluates the effectiveness of ChatGPT, an advanced AI model for
natural language processing, in identifying targeting and inappropriate
language in online comments. With the increasing challenge of moderating vast
volumes of user-generated content on social network sites, the role of AI in
content moderation has gained prominence. We compared ChatGPT's performance
against crowd-sourced annotations and expert evaluations to assess its
accuracy, scope of detection, and consistency. Our findings highlight that
ChatGPT performs well in detecting inappropriate content, showing notable
improvements in accuracy through iterative refinements, particularly in Version
6. However, its performance in targeting language detection showed variability,
with higher false positive rates compared to expert judgments. This study
contributes to the field by demonstrating the potential of AI models like
ChatGPT to enhance automated content moderation systems while also identifying
areas for further improvement. The results underscore the importance of
continuous model refinement and contextual understanding to better support
automated moderation and mitigate harmful online behavior.

### [13] [Counterfactual Simulatability of LLM Explanations for Generation Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21740)
*Marvin Limpijankit,Yanda Chen,Melanie Subbiah,Nicholas Deas,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLMs在解释其行为方面的能力，提出了反事实可模拟性框架，并发现其在生成任务中的应用效果因任务类型而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的行为难以预测，尤其在关键场景中，模型能否准确解释其行为至关重要。反事实可模拟性是评估解释的一种方法，但此前仅用于二分类任务。

Method: 扩展反事实可模拟性框架至生成任务，以新闻摘要和医疗建议为例进行研究。

Result: LLM的解释在新闻摘要任务中帮助用户预测输出，但在医疗建议任务中仍有改进空间。反事实可模拟性更适合技能型任务而非知识型任务。

Conclusion: 反事实可模拟性在生成任务中的应用效果因任务类型而异，未来需进一步优化解释方法。

Abstract: LLMs can be unpredictable, as even slight alterations to the prompt can cause
the output to change in unexpected ways. Thus, the ability of models to
accurately explain their behavior is critical, especially in high-stakes
settings. One approach for evaluating explanations is counterfactual
simulatability, how well an explanation allows users to infer the model's
output on related counterfactuals. Counterfactual simulatability has been
previously studied for yes/no question answering tasks. We provide a general
framework for extending this method to generation tasks, using news
summarization and medical suggestion as example use cases. We find that while
LLM explanations do enable users to better predict LLM outputs on
counterfactuals in the summarization setting, there is significant room for
improvement for medical suggestion. Furthermore, our results suggest that the
evaluation for counterfactual simulatability may be more appropriate for
skill-based tasks as opposed to knowledge-based tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了BehaviorBench数据集和BehaviorSFT训练策略，用于评估和改进LLMs在临床任务中的主动行为表现，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在临床任务中缺乏主动行为（如未提示的风险识别），需要改进以适应实际需求。

Method: 提出BehaviorBench数据集评估行为表现，并设计BehaviorSFT训练策略，通过行为标记动态调整LLMs行为。

Result: BehaviorSFT显著提升性能（Macro F1达97.3%），临床评估显示其行为更真实平衡。

Conclusion: BehaviorSFT有效改善了LLMs的主动行为，为临床代理提供了更优的行为适应性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as clinical agents require careful behavioral
adaptation. While adept at reactive tasks (e.g., diagnosis reasoning), LLMs
often struggle with proactive engagement, like unprompted identification of
critical missing information or risks. We introduce BehaviorBench, a
comprehensive dataset to evaluate agent behaviors across a clinical assistance
spectrum, ranging from reactive query responses to proactive interventions
(e.g., clarifying ambiguities, flagging overlooked critical data). Our
BehaviorBench experiments reveal LLMs' inconsistent proactivity. To address
this, we propose BehaviorSFT, a novel training strategy using behavioral tokens
to explicitly condition LLMs for dynamic behavioral selection along this
spectrum. BehaviorSFT boosts performance, achieving up to 97.3% overall Macro

96.5% for Qwen2.5-7B-Ins). Crucially, blind clinician evaluations confirmed
BehaviorSFT-trained agents exhibit more realistic clinical behavior, striking a
superior balance between helpful proactivity (e.g., timely, relevant
suggestions) and necessary restraint (e.g., avoiding over-intervention) versus
standard fine-tuning or explicit instructed agents.

TL;DR: CCPS是一种通过分析LLMs内部表示稳定性来校准其置信度的方法，显著优于现有方法，提高了模型的可靠性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的置信度校准不足影响其可靠性，需要更准确的置信度估计方法。

Method: CCPS通过针对性对抗扰动最终隐藏状态，提取特征并利用轻量级分类器预测答案正确性。

Result: 在多个LLMs和基准测试中，CCPS显著降低校准误差和Brier分数，同时提高准确性和曲线下面积。

Conclusion: CCPS提供了一种高效、广泛适用且更准确的LLM置信度估计方法，增强了其可信度。

Abstract: Miscalibration in Large Language Models (LLMs) undermines their reliability,
highlighting the need for accurate confidence estimation. We introduce CCPS
(Calibrating LLM Confidence by Probing Perturbed Representation Stability), a
novel method analyzing internal representational stability in LLMs. CCPS
applies targeted adversarial perturbations to final hidden states, extracts
features reflecting the model's response to these perturbations, and uses a
lightweight classifier to predict answer correctness. CCPS was evaluated on
LLMs from 8B to 32B parameters (covering Llama, Qwen, and Mistral
architectures) using MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks in both multiple-choice and
open-ended formats. Our results show that CCPS significantly outperforms
current approaches. Across four LLMs and three MMLU variants, CCPS reduces
Expected Calibration Error by approximately 55% and Brier score by 21%, while
increasing accuracy by 5 percentage points, Area Under the Precision-Recall
Curve by 4 percentage points, and Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic Curve by 6 percentage points, all relative to the strongest
prior method. CCPS delivers an efficient, broadly applicable, and more accurate
solution for estimating LLM confidence, thereby improving their
trustworthiness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究低资源语言对的语音翻译性能，探索不同微调方法对端到端语音翻译任务的影响。

Method: 使用SeamlessM4T-v2进行自动语音识别（ASR）、机器翻译（MT）和端到端语音翻译（E2E ST）的微调，并尝试了直接微调、多任务训练和参数初始化等方法。

Result: 直接端到端微调效果显著；使用微调后的ASR编码器初始化可提升未训练语言的性能；多任务训练略有帮助。

Conclusion: 直接端到端微调是有效的，结合ASR编码器初始化和多任务训练可进一步提升低资源语言对的语音翻译性能。

Abstract: This paper describes the GMU systems for the IWSLT 2025 low-resource speech
translation shared task. We trained systems for all language pairs, except for
Levantine Arabic. We fine-tuned SeamlessM4T-v2 for automatic speech recognition
(ASR), machine translation (MT), and end-to-end speech translation (E2E ST).
The ASR and MT models are also used to form cascaded ST systems. Additionally,
we explored various training paradigms for E2E ST fine-tuning, including direct
E2E fine-tuning, multi-task training, and parameter initialization using
components from fine-tuned ASR and/or MT models. Our results show that (1)
direct E2E fine-tuning yields strong results; (2) initializing with a
fine-tuned ASR encoder improves ST performance on languages SeamlessM4T-v2 has
not been trained on; (3) multi-task training can be slightly helpful.

*Dasha Metropolitansky,Jonathan Larson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VeriTrail是一种新方法，用于检测多步生成过程中的幻觉，并提供可追溯性，优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在封闭领域生成内容时容易产生幻觉，多步生成过程（MGS）比单步生成过程（SGS）风险更高，需要检测幻觉并追踪其来源。

Method: 提出VeriTrail方法，设计首个包含中间输出和人类标注的数据集，用于检测和追踪幻觉。

Result: VeriTrail在两个数据集上表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VeriTrail为多步生成过程的幻觉检测提供了有效解决方案，并支持内容追溯。

Abstract: Even when instructed to adhere to source material, Language Models often
generate unsubstantiated content - a phenomenon known as "closed-domain
hallucination." This risk is amplified in processes with multiple generative
steps (MGS), compared to processes with a single generative step (SGS).
However, due to the greater complexity of MGS processes, we argue that
detecting hallucinations in their final outputs is necessary but not
sufficient: it is equally important to trace where hallucinated content was
likely introduced and how faithful content may have been derived from the
source through intermediate outputs. To address this need, we present
VeriTrail, the first closed-domain hallucination detection method designed to
provide traceability for both MGS and SGS processes. We also introduce the
first datasets to include all intermediate outputs as well as human annotations
of final outputs' faithfulness for their respective MGS processes. We
demonstrate that VeriTrail outperforms baseline methods on both datasets.

TL;DR: 论文分析了阿拉伯语方言的多样性，验证了四种常见假设的准确性，发现这些假设过于简化现实，可能阻碍阿拉伯语NLP任务的进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语方言多样性显著，但现有NLP任务中广泛采用的假设（如方言可按地区分组）未经定量验证，可能影响任务效果。

Method: 通过扩展和分析多标签数据集，手动评估11种国家级别方言中每个句子的有效性。

Result: 分析表明，四种假设过于简化现实，部分假设并不总是准确。

Conclusion: 这些假设的简化可能阻碍阿拉伯语NLP任务的进一步进展。

Abstract: Arabic has diverse dialects, where one dialect can be substantially different
from the others. In the NLP literature, some assumptions about these dialects
are widely adopted (e.g., ``Arabic dialects can be grouped into distinguishable
regional dialects") and are manifested in different computational tasks such as
Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI). However, these assumptions are not
quantitatively verified. We identify four of these assumptions and examine them
by extending and analyzing a multi-label dataset, where the validity of each
sentence in 11 different country-level dialects is manually assessed by
speakers of these dialects. Our analysis indicates that the four assumptions
oversimplify reality, and some of them are not always accurate. This in turn
might be hindering further progress in different Arabic NLP tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成模型中多样性和偏见的问题，确保生成结果能按比例代表训练数据中的兴趣群体。

Method: 引入“代表性生成”概念，提出“群体闭包维度”作为关键组合量，分析其在极限情况下的信息论和计算特性。

Result: 证明了在特定条件下对可数无限假设类和群体集合的可行性，但仅通过成员查询无法实现计算可行性。

Conclusion: 为开发更具多样性和代表性的生成模型提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We introduce "representative generation," extending the theoretical framework
for generation proposed by Kleinberg et al. (2024) and formalized by Li et al.
(2024), to additionally address diversity and bias concerns in generative
models. Our notion requires outputs of a generative model to proportionally
represent groups of interest from the training data. We characterize
representative uniform and non-uniform generation, introducing the "group
closure dimension" as a key combinatorial quantity. For representative
generation in the limit, we analyze both information-theoretic and
computational aspects, demonstrating feasibility for countably infinite
hypothesis classes and collections of groups under certain conditions, but
proving a negative result for computability using only membership queries. This
contrasts with Kleinberg et al.'s (2024) positive results for standard
generation in the limit. Our findings provide a rigorous foundation for
developing more diverse and representative generative models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种三步法来改进多文档摘要中的源覆盖率，包括关键点提取、多样性选择和重写，并结合用户意图生成个性化摘要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理长上下文时存在“中间丢失”现象，导致多文档摘要中源覆盖率不均。

Method: 将摘要任务分为三步：提取关键点、用DPP选择多样性内容、重写为最终摘要，并结合用户意图优化。

Result: 在DiverseSumm基准测试中，源覆盖率得到一致提升，并能生成个性化摘要。

Conclusion: 通过分步和原则性技术结合，有效提升了多文档摘要的源覆盖率和个性化能力。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of handling
longer contexts, recent work has demonstrated that they exhibit the "lost in
the middle" phenomenon (Liu et al., 2024) of unevenly attending to different
parts of the provided context. This hinders their ability to cover diverse
source material in multi-document summarization, as noted in the DiverseSumm
benchmark (Huang et al., 2024). In this work, we contend that principled
content selection is a simple way to increase source coverage on this task. As
opposed to prompting an LLM to perform the summarization in a single step, we
explicitly divide the task into three steps -- (1) reducing document
collections to atomic key points, (2) using determinantal point processes (DPP)
to perform select key points that prioritize diverse content, and (3) rewriting
to the final summary. By combining prompting steps, for extraction and
rewriting, with principled techniques, for content selection, we consistently
improve source coverage on the DiverseSumm benchmark across various LLMs.
Finally, we also show that by incorporating relevance to a provided user intent
into the DPP kernel, we can generate personalized summaries that cover relevant
source information while retaining coverage.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了检索增强生成（RAG）对大型语言模型（LLM）性能的影响，发现RAG并非总是优于非RAG，且检索文档的数量和顺序会影响结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估RAG在实际应用中的稳健性，探讨其是否总是优于非RAG方法，以及检索文档的数量和顺序对性能的影响。

Method: 建立包含1500个开放域问题的基准数据集，引入三个稳健性指标，并对11种LLM和3种提示策略进行实验。

Result: 实验显示LLM在RAG中表现出较高的稳健性，但仍存在不同程度的不足，影响了RAG的潜在优势。

Conclusion: RAG的稳健性限制了其优势的充分发挥，未来研究需进一步优化检索和模型利用能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) generally enhances large language
models' (LLMs) ability to solve knowledge-intensive tasks. But RAG may also
lead to performance degradation due to imperfect retrieval and the model's
limited ability to leverage retrieved content. In this work, we evaluate the
robustness of LLMs in practical RAG setups (henceforth retrieval robustness).
We focus on three research questions: (1) whether RAG is always better than
non-RAG; (2) whether more retrieved documents always lead to better
performance; (3) and whether document orders impact results. To facilitate this
study, we establish a benchmark of 1500 open-domain questions, each with
retrieved documents from Wikipedia. We introduce three robustness metrics, each
corresponds to one research question. Our comprehensive experiments, involving
11 LLMs and 3 prompting strategies, reveal that all of these LLMs exhibit
surprisingly high retrieval robustness; nonetheless, different degrees of
imperfect robustness hinders them from fully utilizing the benefits of RAG.

TL;DR: EFIM是一种改进的提示格式，通过优化KV缓存重用和引入片段标记化训练方法，显著提升了LLM在填充任务中的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KV缓存重用技术在填充任务中因提示格式的结构问题而效率低下，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出EFIM提示格式和片段标记化训练方法，以优化KV缓存重用并解决子标记生成问题。

Result: 实验表明，EFIM将延迟降低52%，吞吐量提升98%，同时保持原有填充能力。

Conclusion: EFIM通过改进提示格式和训练方法，有效提升了LLM在填充任务中的效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often used for infilling tasks, which
involve predicting or generating missing information in a given text. These
tasks typically require multiple interactions with similar context. To reduce
the computation of repeated historical tokens, cross-request key-value (KV)
cache reuse, a technique that stores and reuses intermediate computations, has
become a crucial method in multi-round interactive services. However, in
infilling tasks, the KV cache reuse is often hindered by the structure of the
prompt format, which typically consists of a prefix and suffix relative to the
insertion point. Specifically, the KV cache of the prefix or suffix part is
frequently invalidated as the other part (suffix or prefix) is incrementally
generated. To address the issue, we propose EFIM, a transformed prompt format
of FIM to unleash the performance potential of KV cache reuse. Although the
transformed prompt can solve the inefficiency, it exposes subtoken generation
problems in current LLMs, where they have difficulty generating partial words
accurately. Therefore, we introduce a fragment tokenization training method
which splits text into multiple fragments before tokenization during data
processing. Experiments on two representative LLMs show that LLM serving with
EFIM can lower the latency by 52% and improve the throughput by 98% while
maintaining the original infilling capability.EFIM's source code is publicly
available at https://github.com/gty111/EFIM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体系统在复杂任务中存在资源浪费和执行效率低的问题，需要一种更高效的协作机制。

Method: 提出Co-Saving系统，利用历史成功轨迹中的“捷径”跳过冗余推理，优化资源使用。

Result: 实验显示，相比ChatDev，Co-Saving平均减少50.85%的令牌消耗，代码质量提升10.06%。

Conclusion: Co-Saving通过资源感知和捷径机制，显著提升了多智能体系统的效率和任务质量。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and autonomous agents
have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains. However,
standalone agents frequently encounter limitations when handling complex tasks
that demand extensive interactions and substantial computational resources.
Although Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) alleviate some of these limitations through
collaborative mechanisms like task decomposition, iterative communication, and
role specialization, they typically remain resource-unaware, incurring
significant inefficiencies due to high token consumption and excessive
execution time. To address these limitations, we propose a resource-aware
multi-agent system -- Co-Saving (meaning that multiple agents collaboratively
engage in resource-saving activities), which leverages experiential knowledge
to enhance operational efficiency and solution quality. Our key innovation is
the introduction of "shortcuts" -- instructional transitions learned from
historically successful trajectories -- which allows to bypass redundant
reasoning agents and expedite the collective problem-solving process.
Experiments for software development tasks demonstrate significant advantages
over existing methods. Specifically, compared to the state-of-the-art MAS
ChatDev, our method achieves an average reduction of 50.85% in token usage, and
improves the overall code quality by 10.06%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型主要关注知识图谱的结构信息，忽视了文本信息，限制了其在图谱外任务中的应用。

Method: 提出多视角条件消息传递（CMP）架构和动态残差融合模块，结合结构与文本信息。

Result: 在28个数据集上评估，MERRY在大多数场景中优于基线模型，展示了强大的推理和泛化能力。

Conclusion: MERRY成功整合了知识图谱的文本与结构信息，为图谱内外任务提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: In natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), the successful
application of foundation models across diverse tasks has demonstrated their
remarkable potential. However, despite the rich structural and textual
information embedded in knowledge graphs (KGs), existing research of foundation
model for KG has primarily focused on their structural aspects, with most
efforts restricted to in-KG tasks (e.g., knowledge graph completion, KGC). This
limitation has hindered progress in addressing more challenging out-of-KG
tasks. In this paper, we introduce MERRY, a foundation model for general
knowledge graph reasoning, and investigate its performance across two task
categories: in-KG reasoning tasks (e.g., KGC) and out-of-KG tasks (e.g., KG
question answering, KGQA). We not only utilize the structural information, but
also the textual information in KGs. Specifically, we propose a
multi-perspective Conditional Message Passing (CMP) encoding architecture to
bridge the gap between textual and structural modalities, enabling their
seamless integration. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic residual fusion
module to selectively retain relevant textual information and a flexible edge
scoring mechanism to adapt to diverse downstream tasks. Comprehensive
evaluations on 28 datasets demonstrate that MERRY outperforms existing
baselines in most scenarios, showcasing strong reasoning capabilities within
KGs and excellent generalization to out-of-KG tasks such as KGQA.

TL;DR: RedTeamCUA是一个对抗性测试框架，用于评估计算机使用代理（CUAs）在混合Web-OS攻击场景中的漏洞，发现当前CUAs存在显著的安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法缺乏对混合Web-OS攻击场景的支持，无法在真实但受控的环境中测试CUAs的漏洞。

Method: 提出RedTeamCUA框架，结合VM和Docker的混合沙盒，支持灵活的对抗性场景配置和直接注入点测试。

Result: 测试发现CUAs存在高攻击成功率（ASR），如Claude 3.7 Sonnet的ASR为42.9%，Claude 4 Opus的ASR高达48%。

Conclusion: RedTeamCUA为系统分析CUA漏洞提供了重要工具，强调了在真实部署前需加强对抗间接提示注入的防御。

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) promise to automate complex tasks across operating
systems (OS) and the web, but remain vulnerable to indirect prompt injection.
Current evaluations of this threat either lack support realistic but controlled
environments or ignore hybrid web-OS attack scenarios involving both
interfaces. To address this, we propose RedTeamCUA, an adversarial testing
framework featuring a novel hybrid sandbox that integrates a VM-based OS
environment with Docker-based web platforms. Our sandbox supports key features
tailored for red teaming, such as flexible adversarial scenario configuration,
and a setting that decouples adversarial evaluation from navigational
limitations of CUAs by initializing tests directly at the point of an
adversarial injection. Using RedTeamCUA, we develop RTC-Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark with 864 examples that investigate realistic, hybrid web-OS attack
scenarios and fundamental security vulnerabilities. Benchmarking current
frontier CUAs identifies significant vulnerabilities: Claude 3.7 Sonnet | CUA
demonstrates an ASR of 42.9%, while Operator, the most secure CUA evaluated,
still exhibits an ASR of 7.6%. Notably, CUAs often attempt to execute
adversarial tasks with an Attempt Rate as high as 92.5%, although failing to
complete them due to capability limitations. Nevertheless, we observe
concerning ASRs of up to 50% in realistic end-to-end settings, with the
recently released frontier Claude 4 Opus | CUA showing an alarming ASR of 48%,
demonstrating that indirect prompt injection presents tangible risks for even
advanced CUAs despite their capabilities and safeguards. Overall, RedTeamCUA
provides an essential framework for advancing realistic, controlled, and
systematic analysis of CUA vulnerabilities, highlighting the urgent need for
robust defenses to indirect prompt injection prior to real-world deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态知识图谱和基于提示的方法难以捕捉习语翻译中的复杂关系，导致翻译效果不佳。

Method: 采用适应性图神经网络（GNN）学习习语表达之间的复杂映射，能够泛化到训练中未见过的节点。

Result: 在多个习语翻译数据集上评估，显著提升了从英语到多种印度语言的习语翻译质量。

Conclusion: IdiomCE方法在资源受限环境下也能提升翻译质量，适用于小型模型。

Abstract: Translating multi-word expressions (MWEs) and idioms requires a deep
understanding of the cultural nuances of both the source and target languages.
This challenge is further amplified by the one-to-many nature of idiomatic
translations, where a single source idiom can have multiple target-language
equivalents depending on cultural references and contextual variations.
Traditional static knowledge graphs (KGs) and prompt-based approaches struggle
to capture these complex relationships, often leading to suboptimal
translations. To address this, we propose IdiomCE, an adaptive graph neural
network (GNN) based methodology that learns intricate mappings between
idiomatic expressions, effectively generalizing to both seen and unseen nodes
during training. Our proposed method enhances translation quality even in
resource-constrained settings, facilitating improved idiomatic translation in
smaller models. We evaluate our approach on multiple idiomatic translation
datasets using reference-less metrics, demonstrating significant improvements
in translating idioms from English to various Indian languages.

Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂推理任务（如多跳问答MHQA）中表现不佳，RAG方法在过滤噪声数据和检索必要证据方面存在局限性。

Method: RISE框架包括三个关键步骤：问题分解、检索-阅读和自我批判，通过迭代自我探索优化推理路径。

Result: 在多个MHQA基准测试中，RISE显著提高了推理准确性和任务性能。

Conclusion: RISE通过迭代自我探索有效提升了模型在MHQA任务中的推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in many areas but continue to face
challenges with complex reasoning tasks, such as Multi-Hop Question Answering
(MHQA). MHQA requires integrating evidence from diverse sources while managing
intricate logical dependencies, often leads to errors in reasoning.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), widely employed in MHQA tasks, faces
challenges in effectively filtering noisy data and retrieving all necessary
evidence, thereby limiting its effectiveness in addressing MHQA challenges. To
address these challenges, we propose RISE:Reasoning Enhancement via Iterative
Self-Exploration, a novel framework designed to enhance models' reasoning
capability through iterative self-exploration. Specifically, RISE involves
three key steps in addressing MHQA tasks: question decomposition,
retrieve-then-read, and self-critique. By leveraging continuous
self-exploration, RISE identifies accurate reasoning paths, iteratively
self-improving the model's capability to integrate evidence, maintain logical
consistency, and enhance performance in MHQA tasks. Extensive experiments on
multiple MHQA benchmarks demonstrate that RISE significantly improves reasoning
accuracy and task performance.

We evaluate this approach using perplexity- and reward-based verifiers on two

show consistent quality improvements, with gains exceeding 35% in some cases.
While perplexity-based scoring is effective for open-ended prompts, only
reward-based verifiers improve performance on tasks requiring reasoning (e.g.,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据选择方法在领域特定指令调优中表现不佳，主要原因是忽视了知识冲突的影响。

Method: KDS通过两种知识感知指标（上下文-记忆知识对齐和内部记忆知识一致性）定量衡量知识冲突，筛选高质量数据。

Result: 实验证明KDS在医疗领域显著优于其他基线方法，提升模型性能并缓解幻觉问题。

Conclusion: KDS是一种简单有效的方法，能够优化领域特定指令调优的数据选择，提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Domain-specific instruction-tuning has become the defacto standard for
improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) in specialized
applications, e.g., medical question answering. Since the instruction-tuning
dataset might contain redundant or low-quality data, data selection (DS) is
usually required to maximize the data efficiency. Despite the successes in the
general domain, current DS methods often struggle to select the desired data
for domain-specific instruction-tuning. One of the main reasons is that they
neglect the impact of knowledge conflicts, i.e., the discrepancy between LLMs'
pretrained knowledge and context knowledge of instruction data, which could
damage LLMs' prior abilities and lead to hallucination. To this end, we propose
a simple-yet-effective Knowledge-aware Data Selection (namely KDS) framework to
select the domain-specific instruction-tuning data that meets LLMs' actual
needs. The core of KDS is to leverage two knowledge-aware metrics for
quantitatively measuring knowledge conflicts from two aspects: context-memory
knowledge alignment and intra-memory knowledge consistency. By filtering the
data with large knowledge conflicts and sampling the high-quality and diverse
data, KDS can effectively stimulate the LLMs' abilities and achieve better
domain-specific performance. Taking the medical domain as the testbed, we
conduct extensive experiments and empirically prove that KDS surpasses the
other baselines and brings significant and consistent performance gains among
all LLMs. More encouragingly, KDS effectively improves the model generalization
and alleviates the hallucination problem.

Conclusion: LaMDAgent为后训练管道自动化提供了高效解决方案，同时揭示了数据和模型规模对成本的影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across
a wide range of tasks. To further tailor LLMs to specific domains or
applications, post-training techniques such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
Preference Learning, and model merging are commonly employed. While each of
these methods has been extensively studied in isolation, the automated
construction of complete post-training pipelines remains an underexplored area.
Existing approaches typically rely on manual design or focus narrowly on
optimizing individual components, such as data ordering or merging strategies.
In this work, we introduce LaMDAgent (short for Language Model Developing
Agent), a novel framework that autonomously constructs and optimizes full
post-training pipelines through the use of LLM-based agents. LaMDAgent
systematically explores diverse model generation techniques, datasets, and
hyperparameter configurations, leveraging task-based feedback to discover
high-performing pipelines with minimal human intervention. Our experiments show
that LaMDAgent improves tool-use accuracy by 9.0 points while preserving
instruction-following capabilities. Moreover, it uncovers effective
post-training strategies that are often overlooked by conventional human-driven
exploration. We further analyze the impact of data and model size scaling to
reduce computational costs on the exploration, finding that model size scalings
introduces new challenges, whereas scaling data size enables cost-effective
pipeline discovery.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为{\delta}-Unlearning的框架，用于黑盒大语言模型的遗忘学习，避免直接修改模型权重或保留敏感数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型因训练数据中包含敏感信息（如版权、偏见、隐私内容）而引发的伦理和法律问题。

Method: 通过对比一对较小模型的logit偏移来学习遗忘所需的logit偏移，而非直接调整黑盒模型。

Result: 实验表明，{\delta}-Unlearning能有效遗忘目标数据，同时在非遗忘任务上保持或提升性能。

Conclusion: {\delta}-Unlearning是一种适用于黑盒大语言模型的通用遗忘学习解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the strong capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to acquire
knowledge from their training corpora, the memorization of sensitive
information in the corpora such as copyrighted, biased, and private content has
led to ethical and legal concerns. In response to these challenges, unlearning
has emerged as a potential remedy for LLMs affected by problematic training
data. However, previous unlearning techniques are either not applicable to
black-box LLMs due to required access to model internal weights, or violate
data protection principles by retaining sensitive data for inference-time
correction. We propose {\delta}-Unlearning, an offset unlearning framework for
black-box LLMs. Instead of tuning the black-box LLM itself, {\delta}-Unlearning
learns the logit offset needed for unlearning by contrasting the logits from a
pair of smaller models. Experiments demonstrate that {\delta}- Unlearning can
effectively unlearn target data while maintaining similar or even stronger
performance on general out-of-forget-scope tasks. {\delta}-Unlearning also
effectively incorporates different unlearning algorithms, making our approach a
versatile solution to adapting various existing unlearning algorithms to
black-box LLMs.

Motivation: 尽管LVLMs在多模态任务中表现出色，但其视觉输入引入了新的安全漏洞，需要系统分析。

Result: 揭示了传统对抗攻击如何绕过安全机制，并分类了模型的拒绝行为。

Conclusion: 提出了一种规范化的安全行为目标，为多模态系统的安全对齐提供了原则性指导。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of multimodal tasks. However, their integration of visual
inputs introduces expanded attack surfaces, thereby exposing them to novel
security vulnerabilities. In this work, we conduct a systematic
representational analysis to uncover why conventional adversarial attacks can
circumvent the safety mechanisms embedded in LVLMs. We further propose a novel
two stage evaluation framework for adversarial attacks on LVLMs. The first
stage differentiates among instruction non compliance, outright refusal, and
successful adversarial exploitation. The second stage quantifies the degree to
which the model's output fulfills the harmful intent of the adversarial prompt,
while categorizing refusal behavior into direct refusals, soft refusals, and
partial refusals that remain inadvertently helpful. Finally, we introduce a
normative schema that defines idealized model behavior when confronted with
harmful prompts, offering a principled target for safety alignment in
multimodal systems.

explicitly designed for cultural understanding. Constructed through advanced
agentic workflows and extensive human-in-the-loop annotations by 45 annotators
from across the Arab world, Pearl comprises over K multimodal examples spanning
ten culturally significant domains covering all Arab countries. We further
provide two robust evaluation benchmarks Pearl and Pearl-Lite along with a
specialized subset Pearl-X explicitly developed to assess nuanced cultural
variations. Comprehensive evaluations on state-of-the-art open and proprietary
LVLMs demonstrate that reasoning-centric instruction alignment substantially
improves models' cultural grounding compared to conventional scaling methods.
Pearl establishes a foundational resource for advancing culturally-informed

Motivation: 混合方法研究中，定量与定性数据的结构差异带来挑战，LLMs为整合两者提供了潜在解决方案。

Method: 利用LLMs（如Claude、GPT）生成基于访谈数据的合成调查响应，分析其与人类响应的对齐程度。

Result: LLMs能预测总体响应模式，但多样性不足；提示设计和访谈内容对结果影响较大，人口统计信息影响较小。

Conclusion: LLMs在整合混合方法中具有潜力，但需优化提示设计、减少偏差并提升响应多样性以增强有效性。

Abstract: Mixed methods research integrates quantitative and qualitative data but faces
challenges in aligning their distinct structures, particularly in examining
measurement characteristics and individual response patterns. Advances in large
language models (LLMs) offer promising solutions by generating synthetic survey
responses informed by qualitative data. This study investigates whether LLMs,
guided by personal interviews, can reliably predict human survey responses,
using the Behavioral Regulations in Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ) and
interviews from after-school program staff as a case study. Results indicate
that LLMs capture overall response patterns but exhibit lower variability than
humans. Incorporating interview data improves response diversity for some
models (e.g., Claude, GPT), while well-crafted prompts and low-temperature
settings enhance alignment between LLM and human responses. Demographic
information had less impact than interview content on alignment accuracy. These
findings underscore the potential of interview-informed LLMs to bridge
qualitative and quantitative methodologies while revealing limitations in
response variability, emotional interpretation, and psychometric fidelity.
Future research should refine prompt design, explore bias mitigation, and
optimize model settings to enhance the validity of LLM-generated survey data in
social science research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估LLM多语言性能的方法成本高且难以衡量开放式生成任务，因此需要一种更简单有效的评估方法。

Method: 采用“翻译后评估”策略，从信息和同理心两个维度评估LLM的跨语言一致性。

Result: 研究发现，流行的LLM在三十种语言中存在明显的不一致性，某些语言家族和文字表现尤为薄弱。

Conclusion: 跨语言评估需多维度一致性，论文框架可用于未来多语言LLM的基准测试。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) provide detailed and impressive responses to
queries in English. However, are they really consistent at responding to the
same query in other languages? The popular way of evaluating for multilingual
performance of LLMs requires expensive-to-collect annotated datasets. Further,
evaluating for tasks like open-ended generation, where multiple correct answers
may exist, is nontrivial. Instead, we propose to evaluate the predictability of
model response across different languages. In this work, we propose a framework
to evaluate LLM's cross-lingual consistency based on a simple Translate then
Evaluate strategy. We instantiate this evaluation framework along two
dimensions of consistency: information and empathy. Our results reveal
pronounced inconsistencies in popular LLM responses across thirty languages,
with severe performance deficits in certain language families and scripts,
underscoring critical weaknesses in their multilingual capabilities. These
findings necessitate cross-lingual evaluations that are consistent along
multiple dimensions. We invite practitioners to use our framework for future
multilingual LLM benchmarking.

Abstract: Pursuit of accessible legal assistance in India faces a critical gap, as many
citizens struggle to leverage their legal rights due to limited awareness and
access to relevant legal information. This paper introduces Legal Assist AI, a
transformer-based model designed to bridge this gap by offering effective legal
assistance through large language models (LLMs). The system retrieves relevant

datasets from the Indian legal domain, including Indian Constitution, Bharatiya
Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) and so forth,
providing a robust understanding of the complexities of Indian law. By
incorporating domain-specific legal datasets, the proposed model demonstrated
remarkable efficiency and specialization in legal Question-Answering. The model
was evaluated against state-of-the-art models such as GPT-3.5 Turbo and Mistral
7B, achieving a 60.08% score on the AIBE, outperforming its competitors in

Motivation: 研究发现推理优化的语言模型在简单问题上过度推理，导致输出冗长且效率低下，需解决这一问题。

Method: 提出CoThink流程：指令模型先生成解决方案大纲，推理模型再完善细节，动态调整推理深度。

Result: 在三个数据集上测试，CoThink减少22.3%的token生成，同时保持准确率。

Conclusion: CoThink有效提升推理效率，并观察到潜在的推理效率缩放规律。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) benefit from increased test-time compute, a
phenomenon known as test-time scaling. However, reasoning-optimized models
often overthink even simple problems, producing excessively verbose outputs and
leading to low token efficiency. By comparing these models with equally sized
instruct models, we identify two key causes of this verbosity: (1)
reinforcement learning reduces the information density of forward reasoning,
and (2) backward chain-of thought training encourages redundant and often
unnecessary verification steps. Since LLMs cannot assess the difficulty of a
given problem, they tend to apply the same cautious reasoning strategy across
all tasks, resulting in inefficient overthinking. To address this, we propose
CoThink, an embarrassingly simple pipeline: an instruct model first drafts a
high-level solution outline; a reasoning model then works out the solution. We
observe that CoThink enables dynamic adjustment of reasoning depth based on
input difficulty. Evaluated with three reasoning models DAPO, DeepSeek-R1, and
QwQ on three datasets GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME24, CoThink reduces total token
generation by 22.3% while maintaining pass@1 accuracy within a 0.42% margin on
average. With reference to the instruct model, we formally define reasoning
efficiency and observe a potential reasoning efficiency scaling law in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据打包方法在持续预训练中导致截断和上下文不连续，影响模型性能。

Method: 采用两阶段策略：滑动窗口同步重叠令牌，First-Fit-Decreasing算法优化文本打包。

Result: 在99%的实验设置中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SP策略有效提升模型性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Continual pre-training has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing
model performance, particularly in domain-specific scenarios. The most common
approach for packing data before continual pre-training involves concatenating
input texts and splitting them into fixed-length sequences. While
straightforward and efficient, this method often leads to excessive truncation
and context discontinuity, which can hinder model performance. To address these
issues, we explore the potential of data engineering to enhance continual
pre-training, particularly its impact on model performance and efficiency. We
propose Seamless Packing (SP), a novel data packing strategy aimed at
preserving contextual information more effectively and enhancing model
performance. Our approach employs a sliding window technique in the first stage
that synchronizes overlapping tokens across consecutive sequences, ensuring
better continuity and contextual coherence. In the second stage, we adopt a
First-Fit-Decreasing algorithm to pack shorter texts into bins slightly larger
than the target sequence length, thereby minimizing padding and truncation.
Empirical evaluations across various model architectures and corpus domains
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, outperforming baseline method in
99% of all settings. Code is available at

TL;DR: VRAG-RL是一个基于强化学习的框架，用于解决视觉丰富信息检索与推理中的问题，通过优化视觉语言模型与搜索引擎的交互，提升多模态RAG的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本方法无法处理视觉信息，现有视觉RAG方法因固定流程和推理能力不足而受限，强化学习被证明对模型推理有益。

Method: 提出VRAG-RL框架，通过视觉感知令牌和强化学习优化多轮推理轨迹，定义针对视觉输入的动作空间（如裁剪和缩放），并设计奖励机制。

Result: 解决了视觉RAG中推理令牌分配不足和检索不相关的问题，优化了模型性能。

Conclusion: VRAG-RL通过强化学习策略有效提升了视觉语言模型在RAG任务中的表现，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Effectively retrieving, reasoning and understanding visually rich information
remains a challenge for RAG methods. Traditional text-based methods cannot
handle visual-related information. On the other hand, current vision-based RAG
approaches are often limited by fixed pipelines and frequently struggle to
reason effectively due to the insufficient activation of the fundamental
capabilities of models. As RL has been proven to be beneficial for model
reasoning, we introduce VRAG-RL, a novel RL framework tailored for complex
reasoning across visually rich information. With this framework, VLMs interact
with search engines, autonomously sampling single-turn or multi-turn reasoning
trajectories with the help of visual perception tokens and undergoing continual
optimization based on these samples. Our approach highlights key limitations of
RL in RAG domains: (i) Prior Multi-modal RAG approaches tend to merely
incorporate images into the context, leading to insufficient reasoning token
allocation and neglecting visual-specific perception; and (ii) When models
interact with search engines, their queries often fail to retrieve relevant
information due to the inability to articulate requirements, thereby leading to
suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we define an action space
tailored for visually rich inputs, with actions including cropping and scaling,
allowing the model to gather information from a coarse-to-fine perspective.
Furthermore, to bridge the gap between users' original inquiries and the
retriever, we employ a simple yet effective reward that integrates query
rewriting and retrieval performance with a model-based reward. Our VRAG-RL
optimizes VLMs for RAG tasks using specially designed RL strategies, aligning
the model with real-world applications. The code is available at

Conclusion: JBDistill为安全评估提供了高效、可持续且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly deployed in critical applications,
raising urgent needs for robust safety benchmarking. We propose Jailbreak
Distillation (JBDistill), a novel benchmark construction framework that
"distills" jailbreak attacks into high-quality and easily-updatable safety
benchmarks. JBDistill utilizes a small set of development models and existing
jailbreak attack algorithms to create a candidate prompt pool, then employs
prompt selection algorithms to identify an effective subset of prompts as
safety benchmarks. JBDistill addresses challenges in existing safety
evaluation: the use of consistent evaluation prompts across models ensures fair
comparisons and reproducibility. It requires minimal human effort to rerun the
JBDistill pipeline and produce updated benchmarks, alleviating concerns on
saturation and contamination. Extensive experiments demonstrate our benchmarks
generalize robustly to 13 diverse evaluation models held out from benchmark
construction, including proprietary, specialized, and newer-generation LLMs,
significantly outperforming existing safety benchmarks in effectiveness while
maintaining high separability and diversity. Our framework thus provides an
effective, sustainable, and adaptable solution for streamlining safety
evaluation.

Result: 实验证明Mirabel能有效防御多种先进MIA方法，且适用于现有私有RAG系统。

Conclusion: Mirabel在保护隐私的同时保持了数据实用性，且系统无关。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates the hallucination problem in
large language models (LLMs) and has proven effective for specific,
personalized applications. However, passing private retrieved documents
directly to LLMs introduces vulnerability to membership inference attacks
(MIAs), which try to determine whether the target datum exists in the private
external database or not. Based on the insight that MIA queries typically
exhibit high similarity to only one target document, we introduce Mirabel, a
similarity-based MIA detection framework designed for the RAG system. With the
proposed Mirabel, we show that simple detect-and-hide strategies can
successfully obfuscate attackers, maintain data utility, and remain
system-agnostic. We experimentally prove its detection and defense against
various state-of-the-art MIA methods and its adaptability to existing private
RAG systems.

Motivation: 现有研究表明，强化学习（RLVR）仅优化推理路径而非推理能力，而监督微调（SFT）能提升推理能力。科学信息抽取（SciIE）任务中，LLMs表现不佳，需结合推理与记忆能力。

Method: 1. MimicSFT：使用结构化推理模板，无需高质量链式思考数据；2. R²GRPO：结合相关性和规则诱导奖励的强化学习。

Result: 实验表明，两阶段方法提升了推理能力，R²GRPO结合MimicSFT在关系抽取任务中超越基线LLMs和专用监督模型。

Conclusion: SFT和RLVR均可优化推理路径并提升推理能力，两阶段方法在SciIE任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Previous study suggest that powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) trained
with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) only refines
reasoning path without improving the reasoning capacity in math tasks while
supervised-finetuning(SFT) with distillation can. We study this from the view
of Scientific information extraction (SciIE) where LLMs and reasoning LLMs
underperforms small Bert-based models. SciIE require both the reasoning and
memorization. We argue that both SFT and RLVR can refine the reasoning path and
improve reasoning capacity in a simple way based on SciIE. We propose two-stage
training with 1. MimicSFT, using structured reasoning templates without needing
high-quality chain-of-thought data, 2. R$^2$GRPO with relevance and
rule-induced rewards. Experiments on scientific IE benchmarks show that both
methods can improve the reasoning capacity. R$^2$GRPO with mimicSFT surpasses

Motivation: 尽管指令跟随型LLM在未见任务上表现良好，但在需要领域知识的任务中仍存在困难，尤其是在计算论证领域。

Method: 通过分析现有CA研究，设计了105个CA任务的自然语言指令，并开发了CA专用基准。利用52k条CA相关指令进行自指导微调。

Result: 实验表明，CA专用指令微调显著提升了LLM在CA任务中的表现，同时不影响其在通用NLP任务中的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LLM在特定领域的任务表现，同时保持了其通用能力。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) to follow instructions has
significantly enhanced their ability to tackle unseen tasks. However, despite
their strong generalization capabilities, instruction-following LLMs encounter
difficulties when dealing with tasks that require domain knowledge. This work
introduces a specialized instruction fine-tuning for the domain of
computational argumentation (CA). The goal is to enable an LLM to effectively
tackle any unseen CA tasks while preserving its generalization capabilities.
Reviewing existing CA research, we crafted natural language instructions for
105 CA tasks to this end. On this basis, we developed a CA-specific benchmark
for LLMs that allows for a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' capabilities in
solving various CA tasks. We synthesized 52k CA-related instructions, adapting
the self-instruct process to train a CA-specialized instruction-following LLM.
Our experiments suggest that CA-specialized instruction fine-tuning
significantly enhances the LLM on both seen and unseen CA tasks. At the same
time, performance on the general NLP tasks of the SuperNI benchmark remains
stable.

Conclusion: R1-Router通过动态知识检索和优化推理行为，显著提升了多模态问答的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) has shown promise in
mitigating hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by
incorporating external knowledge during generation. Existing MRAG methods
typically adopt a static retrieval pipeline that fetches relevant information
from multiple Knowledge Bases (KBs), followed by a refinement step. However,
these approaches overlook the reasoning and planning capabilities of MLLMs to
dynamically determine how to interact with different KBs during the reasoning
process. To address this limitation, we propose R1-Router, a novel MRAG
framework that learns to decide when and where to retrieve knowledge based on
the evolving reasoning state. Specifically, R1-Router can generate follow-up
queries according to the current reasoning step, routing these intermediate
queries to the most suitable KB, and integrating external knowledge into a
coherent reasoning trajectory to answer the original query. Furthermore, we
introduce Step-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), a tailored
reinforcement learning algorithm that assigns step-specific rewards to optimize
the reasoning behavior of MLLMs. Experimental results on various open-domain QA
benchmarks across multiple modalities demonstrate that R1-Router outperforms
baseline models by over 7%. Further analysis shows that R1-Router can
adaptively and effectively leverage diverse KBs, reducing unnecessary
retrievals and improving both efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: 提出的知识库方法有效提升了文本到SQL的准确性，适用于不同领域和数据集。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL aims to translate natural language queries into SQL statements,
which is practical as it enables anyone to easily retrieve the desired
information from databases. Recently, many existing approaches tackle this
problem with Large Language Models (LLMs), leveraging their strong capability
in understanding user queries and generating corresponding SQL code. Yet, the
parametric knowledge in LLMs might be limited to covering all the diverse and
domain-specific queries that require grounding in various database schemas,
which makes generated SQLs less accurate oftentimes. To tackle this, we propose
constructing the knowledge base for text-to-SQL, a foundational source of
knowledge, from which we retrieve and generate the necessary knowledge for
given queries. In particular, unlike existing approaches that either manually
annotate knowledge or generate only a few pieces of knowledge for each query,
our knowledge base is comprehensive, which is constructed based on a
combination of all the available questions and their associated database
schemas along with their relevant knowledge, and can be reused for unseen
databases from different datasets and domains. We validate our approach on
multiple text-to-SQL datasets, considering both the overlapping and
non-overlapping database scenarios, where it outperforms relevant baselines
substantially.

TL;DR: MemOS是一个为大型语言模型设计的内存操作系统，首次将内存提升为一类操作资源，解决了当前LLM在内存管理上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM缺乏统一和结构化的内存架构，主要依赖参数内存和临时激活内存，限制了长期知识演化的能力。

Method: MemOS引入了MemCube作为标准化内存抽象，支持异构内存的跟踪、融合和迁移，并提供结构化、可追溯的访问。

Result: MemOS填补了当前LLM基础设施的关键空白，为下一代智能系统的持续适应、个性化智能和跨平台协调奠定了基础。

Conclusion: MemOS通过统一的内存表示、组织和治理机制，显著提升了LLM的内存管理能力，为AGI的发展提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as foundational infrastructure in
the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Despite their remarkable
capabilities in language perception and generation, current LLMs fundamentally
lack a unified and structured architecture for handling memory. They primarily
rely on parametric memory (knowledge encoded in model weights) and ephemeral
activation memory (context-limited runtime states). While emerging methods like
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) incorporate plaintext memory, they lack
lifecycle management and multi-modal integration, limiting their capacity for
long-term knowledge evolution. To address this, we introduce MemOS, a memory
operating system designed for LLMs that, for the first time, elevates memory to
a first-class operational resource. It builds unified mechanisms for
representation, organization, and governance across three core memory types:
parametric, activation, and plaintext. At its core is the MemCube, a
standardized memory abstraction that enables tracking, fusion, and migration of
heterogeneous memory, while offering structured, traceable access across tasks
and contexts. MemOS establishes a memory-centric execution framework with
strong controllability, adaptability, and evolvability. It fills a critical gap
in current LLM infrastructure and lays the groundwork for continual adaptation,
personalized intelligence, and cross-platform coordination in next-generation
intelligent systems.

Motivation: 传统Transformer模型在长上下文建模中存在计算冗余问题，所有token消耗相同计算资源，而实际注意力权重稀疏。

Method: 将序列建模重新定义为监督学习任务，分析注意力稀疏性，提出基于线性编码的分组策略（DGA）以减少冗余。

Result: DGA显著降低计算成本，同时保持性能竞争力。

Conclusion: DGA通过分组编码策略有效减少冗余，为长上下文建模提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) excel in natural language
processing tasks by capturing long-range dependencies through self-attention
mechanisms. However, long-context modeling faces significant computational
inefficiencies due to \textit{redundant} attention computations: while
attention weights are often \textit{sparse}, all tokens consume \textit{equal}
computational resources. In this paper, we reformulate traditional
probabilistic sequence modeling as a \textit{supervised learning task},
enabling the separation of relevant and irrelevant tokens and providing a
clearer understanding of redundancy. Based on this reformulation, we
theoretically analyze attention sparsity, revealing that only a few tokens
significantly contribute to predictions. Building on this, we formulate
attention optimization as a linear coding problem and propose a \textit{group
coding strategy}, theoretically showing its ability to improve robustness
against random noise and enhance learning efficiency. Motivated by this, we
propose \textit{Dynamic Group Attention} (DGA), which leverages the group
coding to explicitly reduce redundancy by aggregating less important tokens
during attention computation. Empirical results show that our DGA significantly
reduces computational costs while maintaining competitive performance.Code is

Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂任务中表现优异，但在简单任务中过度思考导致计算资源浪费，亟需系统性研究。

Method: 引入Think-Bench基准和新效率指标，从推理过程、结果质量和链式思维（CoT）特性多维度评估LRMs。

Result: 多数LRMs在简单问题上过度思考，生成冗长推理链；部分模型CoT质量高但效率低。

Conclusion: Think-Bench为LRMs研究提供了坚实基础，未来可推动效率优化。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance in complex
tasks, often outperforming conventional large language models (LLMs). However,
the prevalent issue of overthinking severely limits their computational
efficiency. Overthinking occurs when models generate excessive and redundant
tokens that contribute little to accurate outcomes, especially in simple tasks,
resulting in a significant waste of computational resources. To systematically
investigate this issue, we introduce Think-Bench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate the reasoning efficiency of LRMs. We also propose novel efficiency
metrics and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various LRMs across multiple
dimensions, including the reasoning process, outcome quality, and
chain-of-thought (CoT) characteristics. Our analysis reveals that most LRMs
exhibit overthinking in handling easy questions, generating unnecessarily
lengthy reasoning chains. While many LRMs demonstrate high CoT quality, several
suffer from low efficiency. We hope that Think-Bench can serve as a robust
foundation for advancing research into LRMs.

Motivation: 术中低血压（IOH）与不良后果（如心肌损伤和死亡率增加）密切相关，但预测IOH因事件稀疏性和数据整合困难而受限。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：1）基于扩散方法增强的生理时间序列进行领域自适应预训练；2）在原始临床数据集上进行任务微调。通过标记级对齐实现多模态融合。

Result: 在两个术中数据集上的实验表明，IOHFuseLM在准确识别IOH事件方面优于现有基线。

Conclusion: IOHFuseLM在临床决策支持中具有潜在应用价值，代码已公开以促进可重复性。

Abstract: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) frequently occurs under general anesthesia
and is strongly linked to adverse outcomes such as myocardial injury and
increased mortality. Despite its significance, IOH prediction is hindered by
event sparsity and the challenge of integrating static and dynamic data across
diverse patients. In this paper, we propose \textbf{IOHFuseLM}, a multimodal
language model framework. To accurately identify and differentiate sparse
hypotensive events, we leverage a two-stage training strategy. The first stage
involves domain adaptive pretraining on IOH physiological time series augmented
through diffusion methods, thereby enhancing the model sensitivity to patterns
associated with hypotension. Subsequently, task fine-tuning is performed on the
original clinical dataset to further enhance the ability to distinguish
normotensive from hypotensive states. To enable multimodal fusion for each
patient, we align structured clinical descriptions with the corresponding
physiological time series at the token level. Such alignment enables the model
to capture individualized temporal patterns alongside their corresponding
clinical semantics. In addition, we convert static patient attributes into
structured text to enrich personalized information. Experimental evaluations on
two intraoperative datasets demonstrate that IOHFuseLM outperforms established
baselines in accurately identifying IOH events, highlighting its applicability
in clinical decision support scenarios. Our code is publicly available to
promote reproducibility at https://github.com/zjt-gpu/IOHFuseLM.

Motivation: 自动化检索事实核查声明可辅助专业核查人员，但现有方法多为单语言，而全球性事件需要跨语言检索能力。

Method: 研究了负样本选择（监督学习）和重排序（无监督学习）策略，并评估了47种语言的数据集。

Result: 最佳结果来自基于LLM的重排序，其次是基于句子相似度的负样本微调。跨语言任务具有独特特性。

Conclusion: 跨语言检索任务需特殊处理，LLM重排序和负样本选择是有效策略。

Abstract: Retrieval of previously fact-checked claims is a well-established task, whose
automation can assist professional fact-checkers in the initial steps of
information verification. Previous works have mostly tackled the task
monolingually, i.e., having both the input and the retrieved claims in the same
language. However, especially for languages with a limited availability of
fact-checks and in case of global narratives, such as pandemics, wars, or
international politics, it is crucial to be able to retrieve claims across
languages. In this work, we examine strategies to improve the multilingual and
crosslingual performance, namely selection of negative examples (in the
supervised) and re-ranking (in the unsupervised setting). We evaluate all
approaches on a dataset containing posts and claims in 47 languages (283
language combinations). We observe that the best results are obtained by using
LLM-based re-ranking, followed by fine-tuning with negative examples sampled
using a sentence similarity-based strategy. Most importantly, we show that
crosslinguality is a setup with its own unique characteristics compared to the
multilingual setup.

Abstract: Fine-tuning adapts pretrained models for specific tasks but poses the risk of
catastrophic forgetting (CF), where critical knowledge from pre-training is
overwritten. Current Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods for Large
Language Models (LLMs), while efficient, often sacrifice general capabilities.
To address the issue of CF in a general-purpose PEFT framework, we propose
\textbf{Lo}w-damage \textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{I}mplanting (\textbf{LoKI}), a
PEFT technique that is based on a mechanistic understanding of how knowledge is
stored in transformer architectures. In two real-world scenarios, LoKI
demonstrates task-specific performance that is comparable to or even surpasses
that of full fine-tuning and LoRA-based methods across various model types,
while significantly better preserving general capabilities. Our work connects
mechanistic insights into LLM knowledge storage with practical fine-tuning
objectives, achieving state-of-the-art trade-offs between task specialization
and the preservation of general capabilities. Our implementation is publicly
available as ready-to-use code\footnote{https://github.com/Nexround/LoKI}.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities
and achieved promising results in mathematical problem-solving tasks. Learning
from errors offers the potential to further enhance the performance of LLMs
during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, the errors in synthesized
solutions are typically gathered from sampling trails, making it challenging to
generate solution errors for each mathematical problem. This paper introduces
the Error-IndUced LEaRning (EULER) model, which aims to develop an error
exposure model that generates high-quality solution errors to enhance the
mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, EULER optimizes the
error exposure model to increase the generation probability of self-made
solution errors while utilizing solutions produced by a superior LLM to
regularize the generation quality. Our experiments across various mathematical
problem datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the EULER model, achieving an
improvement of over 4% compared to all baseline models. Further analysis
reveals that EULER is capable of synthesizing more challenging and educational
solution errors, which facilitate both the training and inference processes of
LLMs. All codes are available at https://github.com/NEUIR/EULER.

Conclusion: RAD为混合模型的高效优化与性能提升提供了新途径。

Abstract: Hybrid models combining Transformers and State Space Models (SSMs) are
promising for balancing performance and efficiency. However, optimizing these
hybrid models, particularly by addressing the potential redundancy inherent
within the Transformer components, remains a significant challenge. In this
paper, we propose RAD (Redundancy-Aware Distillation), a novel framework that
uses self-speculative decoding as a diagnostic tool to identify redundant
attention layers within the model. These identified layers are then selectively
replaced with SSM components, followed by targeted (self-)distillation.
Specifically, RAD focuses knowledge transfer on the components identified as
redundant, considering architectural changes and specific weight initialization
strategies. We experimentally demonstrate that self-distillation using RAD
significantly surpasses the performance of the original base model on
mathematical and coding tasks. Furthermore, RAD is also effective in standard
knowledge distillation settings, achieving up to approximately 2x faster
convergence compared to baseline methods. Notably, while a baseline model
distilled from a Llama-3.1 70B teacher achieves scores of 46.17 on GSM8K and
22.75 on CRUX, RAD achieves significantly higher scores of 71.27 on GSM8K and
28.25 on CRUX, even when using a much smaller Llama-3.1 8B teacher. RAD offers
a new pathway for efficient optimization and performance enhancement in the
distillation of hybrid models.

Conclusion: BERT类模型的泛化能力有限，但通过任务特定预训练和联合训练可显著提升其鲁棒性和泛化性。

Abstract: Identifying arguments is a necessary prerequisite for various tasks in
automated discourse analysis, particularly within contexts such as political
debates, online discussions, and scientific reasoning. In addition to
theoretical advances in understanding the constitution of arguments, a
significant body of research has emerged around practical argument mining,
supported by a growing number of publicly available datasets. On these
benchmarks, BERT-like transformers have consistently performed best,
reinforcing the belief that such models are broadly applicable across diverse
contexts of debate. This study offers the first large-scale re-evaluation of
such state-of-the-art models, with a specific focus on their ability to
generalize in identifying arguments. We evaluate four transformers, three
standard and one enhanced with contrastive pre-training for better
generalization, on 17 English sentence-level datasets as most relevant to the
task. Our findings show that, to varying degrees, these models tend to rely on
lexical shortcuts tied to content words, suggesting that apparent progress may
often be driven by dataset-specific cues rather than true task alignment. While
the models achieve strong results on familiar benchmarks, their performance
drops markedly when applied to unseen datasets. Nonetheless, incorporating both
task-specific pre-training and joint benchmark training proves effective in
enhancing both robustness and generalization.

Result: 实验表明，InComeS在多样化的模型编辑基准测试中表现高效且有效。

Conclusion: InComeS通过上下文压缩和动态选择机制，显著提升了LLM在复杂编辑任务中的性能。

Abstract: Although existing model editing methods perform well in recalling exact edit
facts, they often struggle in complex scenarios that require deeper semantic
understanding rather than mere knowledge regurgitation. Leveraging the strong
contextual reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), in-context
learning (ICL) becomes a promising editing method by comprehending edit
information through context encoding. However, this method is constrained by
the limited context window of LLMs, leading to degraded performance and
efficiency as the number of edits increases. To overcome this limitation, we
propose InComeS, a flexible framework that enhances LLMs' ability to process
editing contexts through explicit compression and selection mechanisms.
Specifically, InComeS compresses each editing context into the key-value (KV)
cache of a special gist token, enabling efficient handling of multiple edits
without being restricted by the model's context window. Furthermore,
specialized cross-attention modules are added to dynamically select the most
relevant information from the gist pools, enabling adaptive and effective
utilization of edit information. We conduct experiments on diverse model
editing benchmarks with various editing formats, and the results demonstrate
the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

efficiently bin data points into groups, estimate quality using specialized
models, and score difficulty with a robust, lightweight method. Task-based
categorization allows us to control the composition of our final data --
crucial for finetuning multi-purpose models. To guarantee diversity, we improve
upon previous work using embedding models and a clustering algorithm. This
integrated strategy enables high-performance fine-tuning with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: NeoDiff为文本生成提供了更高效、精细的框架，推动了扩散模型在文本生成领域的发展。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a promising approach for text generation,
with recent works falling into two main categories: discrete and continuous
diffusion models. Discrete diffusion models apply token corruption
independently using categorical distributions, allowing for different diffusion
progress across tokens but lacking fine-grained control. Continuous diffusion
models map tokens to continuous spaces and apply fine-grained noise, but the
diffusion progress is uniform across tokens, limiting their ability to capture
semantic nuances. To address these limitations, we propose
\textbf{\underline{N}}on-simultan\textbf{\underline{e}}ous
C\textbf{\underline{o}}ntinuous \textbf{\underline{Diff}}usion Models
(NeoDiff), a novel diffusion model that integrates the strengths of both
discrete and continuous approaches. NeoDiff introduces a Poisson diffusion
process for the forward process, enabling a flexible and fine-grained noising
paradigm, and employs a time predictor for the reverse process to adaptively
modulate the denoising progress based on token semantics. Furthermore, NeoDiff
utilizes an optimized schedule for inference to ensure more precise noise
control and improved performance. Our approach unifies the theories of discrete
and continuous diffusion models, offering a more principled and effective
framework for text generation. Experimental results on several text generation
tasks demonstrate NeoDiff's superior performance compared to baselines of
non-autoregressive continuous and discrete diffusion models, iterative-based
methods and autoregressive diffusion-based methods. These results highlight
NeoDiff's potential as a powerful tool for generating high-quality text and
advancing the field of diffusion-based text generation.

Abstract: LLMs are highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, yet standard benchmarks
typically report performance using a single prompt, raising concerns about the
reliability of such evaluations. In this work, we argue for a stochastic method
of moments evaluation over the space of meaning-preserving prompt
perturbations. We introduce a formal definition of reliable evaluation that
accounts for prompt sensitivity, and suggest ReliableEval - a method for
estimating the number of prompt resamplings needed to obtain meaningful
results. Using our framework, we stochastically evaluate five frontier LLMs and

Motivation: 处理带有多个约束的复杂指令时，现有方法因偏好对噪声（如选择的示例未完全满足约束或拒绝的示例在某些方面优于选择的示例）而表现不佳。

Method: 提出RPO方法，动态反转指令中的约束，确保选择的响应完美满足约束，同时扩大选择与拒绝响应之间的差距，优化方向更清晰。

Result: 在Sysbench和Multi-IF基准测试中，RPO分别比DPO基线平均提升4.6和2.5分（基于Llama-3.1 8B模型），且在8B到70B参数范围内均表现优异，70B RPO模型甚至超越GPT-4o。

Conclusion: RPO是一种简单有效的方法，显著提升了模型处理复杂指令的能力，且在不同规模模型上均表现出色。

Abstract: Instruction following (IF) is a critical capability for large language models
(LLMs). However, handling complex instructions with multiple constraints
remains challenging. Previous methods typically select preference pairs based
on the number of constraints they satisfy, introducing noise where chosen
examples may fail to follow some constraints and rejected examples may excel in
certain respects over the chosen ones. To address the challenge of aligning
with multiple preferences, we propose a simple yet effective method called
Reverse Preference Optimization (RPO). It mitigates noise in preference pairs
by dynamically reversing the constraints within the instruction to ensure the
chosen response is perfect, alleviating the burden of extensive sampling and
filtering to collect perfect responses. Besides, reversal also enlarges the gap
between chosen and rejected responses, thereby clarifying the optimization
direction and making it more robust to noise. We evaluate RPO on two multi-turn
IF benchmarks, Sysbench and Multi-IF, demonstrating average improvements over
the DPO baseline of 4.6 and 2.5 points (on Llama-3.1 8B), respectively.
Moreover, RPO scales effectively across model sizes (8B to 70B parameters),
with the 70B RPO model surpassing GPT-4o.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TabXEval的表格评估框架，结合结构对齐和语义比较，通过TabXBench基准验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表格评估方法难以捕捉结构和内容的细微差异，需要更全面和可解释的评估工具。

Method: TabXEval采用两阶段评估：TabAlign进行结构对齐，TabCompare进行语义和语法比较。

Result: TabXEval在TabXBench基准上表现优异，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: TabXEval为可解释的表格评估提供了新方向，适用于多领域任务。

Abstract: Evaluating tables qualitatively & quantitatively presents a significant
challenge, as traditional metrics often fail to capture nuanced structural and
content discrepancies. To address this, we introduce a novel, methodical rubric
integrating multi-level structural descriptors with fine-grained contextual
quantification, thereby establishing a robust foundation for comprehensive
table comparison. Building on this foundation, we propose TabXEval, an
eXhaustive and eXplainable two-phase evaluation framework. TabXEval initially
aligns reference tables structurally via TabAlign & subsequently conducts a
systematic semantic and syntactic comparison using TabCompare; this approach
clarifies the evaluation process and pinpoints subtle discrepancies overlooked
by conventional methods. The efficacy of this framework is assessed using
TabXBench, a novel, diverse, multi-domain benchmark we developed, featuring
realistic table perturbations and human-annotated assessments. Finally, a
systematic analysis of existing evaluation methods through
sensitivity-specificity trade-offs demonstrates the qualitative and
quantitative effectiveness of TabXEval across diverse table-related tasks and
domains, paving the way for future innovations in explainable table evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了将推测解码与量化技术结合的方法，发现4位权重量化在推测解码中的计算开销抵消了其内存优势，并提出了一种分层框架以优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过结合推测解码和量化技术，进一步加速大型语言模型的内存受限推理。

Method: 提出分层框架，使用小模型作为中间阶段，将树状草稿转为序列草稿，以利用量化模型的内存访问优势。

Result: 实验显示，分层方法在4位权重量化的Llama-3-70B模型上实现了2.78倍加速，优于EAGLE-2。

Conclusion: 分层框架有效平衡了量化与推测解码的优势，显著提升了推理速度。

Abstract: Speculative decoding and quantization effectively accelerate memory-bound
inference of large language models. Speculative decoding mitigates the memory
bandwidth bottleneck by verifying multiple tokens within a single forward pass,
which increases computational effort. Quantization achieves this optimization
by compressing weights and activations into lower bit-widths and also reduces
computations via low-bit matrix multiplications. To further leverage their
strengths, we investigate the integration of these two techniques.
Surprisingly, experiments applying the advanced speculative decoding method
EAGLE-2 to various quantized models reveal that the memory benefits from 4-bit
weight quantization are diminished by the computational load from speculative
decoding. Specifically, verifying a tree-style draft incurs significantly more
time overhead than a single-token forward pass on 4-bit weight quantized
models. This finding led to our new speculative decoding design: a hierarchical
framework that employs a small model as an intermediate stage to turn
tree-style drafts into sequence drafts, leveraging the memory access benefits
of the target quantized model. Experimental results show that our hierarchical
approach achieves a 2.78$\times$ speedup across various tasks for the 4-bit
weight Llama-3-70B model on an A100 GPU, outperforming EAGLE-2 by 1.31$\times$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体中伪装毒性内容（如同音字替换）的检测问题尚未解决，现有方法多针对英文，中文领域缺乏有效方案。

Method: C²TU基于子串匹配识别候选毒性词，结合BERT和LLMs进行过滤和纠正，利用语义上下文揭示伪装词。

Result: 在中文毒性数据集上表现优异，F1分数和准确率分别比最佳竞争对手高出71%和35%。

Conclusion: C²TU为中文伪装毒性内容检测提供了高效且无需训练的解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Social media platforms have experienced a significant rise in toxic content,
including abusive language and discriminatory remarks, presenting growing
challenges for content moderation. Some users evade censorship by deliberately
disguising toxic words through homophonic cloak, which necessitates the task of
unveiling cloaked toxicity. Existing methods are mostly designed for English
texts, while Chinese cloaked toxicity unveiling has not been solved yet. To
tackle the issue, we propose C$^2$TU, a novel training-free and prompt-free
method for Chinese cloaked toxic content unveiling. It first employs substring
matching to identify candidate toxic words based on Chinese homo-graph and
toxic lexicon. Then it filters those candidates that are non-toxic and corrects
cloaks to be their corresponding toxicities. Specifically, we develop two model
variants for filtering, which are based on BERT and LLMs, respectively. For
LLMs, we address the auto-regressive limitation in computing word occurrence
probability and utilize the full semantic contexts of a text sequence to reveal
cloaked toxic words. Extensive experiments demonstrate that C$^2$TU can achieve
superior performance on two Chinese toxic datasets. In particular, our method
outperforms the best competitor by up to 71% on the F1 score and 35% on
accuracy, respectively.

TL;DR: 研究探讨预训练语言模型是否能通过句子级连续嵌入进行抽象推理，提出两种嵌入范式，并在多个领域验证其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类推理基于高层抽象（如句子、命题），而语言模型仅逐词生成，研究试图弥合这一差距。

Method: 提出框架，将预训练模型提升至句子空间，通过自回归预测连续句子嵌入，探索语义嵌入和上下文嵌入两种范式。

Result: 上下文嵌入在连续推理下性能接近CoT，同时减少一半计算量，并展示可扩展性和模块化适应性。

Conclusion: 预训练模型可在潜在嵌入空间实现高效抽象推理。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models (LMs) generate one token at a time, yet human
reasoning operates over higher-level abstractions - sentences, propositions,
and concepts. This contrast raises a central question- Can LMs likewise learn
to reason over structured semantic units rather than raw token sequences? In
this work, we investigate whether pretrained LMs can be lifted into such
abstract reasoning spaces by building on their learned representations. We
present a framework that adapts a pretrained token-level LM to operate in
sentence space by autoregressively predicting continuous embeddings of next
sentences. We explore two embedding paradigms inspired by classical
representation learning: 1) semantic embeddings, learned via autoencoding to
preserve surface meaning; and 2) contextual embeddings, trained via
next-sentence prediction to encode anticipatory structure. We evaluate both
under two inference regimes: Discretized, which decodes each predicted
embedding into text before re-encoding; and Continuous, which reasons entirely
in embedding space for improved efficiency. Across four domains - mathematics,
logic, commonsense, and planning - contextual embeddings under continuous
inference show competitive performance with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) while
reducing inference-time FLOPs on average by half. We also present early signs
of scalability and modular adaptation. Finally, to visualize latent
trajectories, we introduce SentenceLens, a diagnostic tool that decodes
intermediate model states into interpretable sentences. Together, our results
indicate that pretrained LMs can effectively transition to abstract, structured
reasoning within latent embedding spaces.

Method: JQL通过预训练多语言嵌入的轻量级注释器，系统化筛选高质量多语言数据。

Result: 在35种语言上验证，JQL显著优于Fineweb2等现有方法，提升下游模型训练质量和数据保留率。

Conclusion: JQL为多语言数据筛选提供实用工具，提升了多语言数据集开发标准。

Abstract: High-quality multilingual training data is essential for effectively
pretraining large language models (LLMs). Yet, the availability of suitable
open-source multilingual datasets remains limited. Existing state-of-the-art
datasets mostly rely on heuristic filtering methods, restricting both their
cross-lingual transferability and scalability. Here, we introduce JQL, a
systematic approach that efficiently curates diverse and high-quality
multilingual data at scale while significantly reducing computational demands.
JQL distills LLMs' annotation capabilities into lightweight annotators based on
pretrained multilingual embeddings. These models exhibit robust multilingual
and cross-lingual performance, even for languages and scripts unseen during
training. Evaluated empirically across 35 languages, the resulting annotation
pipeline substantially outperforms current heuristic filtering methods like
Fineweb2. JQL notably enhances downstream model training quality and increases
data retention rates. Our research provides practical insights and valuable
resources for multilingual data curation, raising the standards of multilingual
dataset development.

Motivation: 探讨TTS系统如何利用句法信息生成语调短语边界，尤其是在句法模糊的情况下。

Method: 使用心理语言学方法分析TTS系统，重点关注语调短语边界的生成，并在无逗号的句子上微调模型。

Result: TTS系统在句法模糊的句子中依赖表面标记（如逗号），而在简单结构中能利用句法线索。微调后模型能生成更符合底层结构的语调模式。

Conclusion: TTS系统在句法模糊时表现不佳，但通过微调可以提升其对语言线索的敏感性，从而生成更准确的语调边界。

Abstract: We analyze the syntactic sensitivity of Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems using
methods inspired by psycholinguistic research. Specifically, we focus on the
generation of intonational phrase boundaries, which can often be predicted by
identifying syntactic boundaries within a sentence. We find that TTS systems
struggle to accurately generate intonational phrase boundaries in sentences
where syntactic boundaries are ambiguous (e.g., garden path sentences or
sentences with attachment ambiguity). In these cases, systems need superficial
cues such as commas to place boundaries at the correct positions. In contrast,
for sentences with simpler syntactic structures, we find that systems do
incorporate syntactic cues beyond surface markers. Finally, we finetune models
on sentences without commas at the syntactic boundary positions, encouraging
them to focus on more subtle linguistic cues. Our findings indicate that this
leads to more distinct intonation patterns that better reflect the underlying
structure.

Motivation: 现有基准无法评估生物医学领域的多跳推理，尤其是涉及复杂关系的查询，导致这一关键挑战未被充分研究。

Method: 基于PrimeKG构建BioHopR，包含1跳和2跳推理任务，反映真实生物医学复杂性。

Result: O3-mini在1跳任务中精度37.93%，2跳任务14.57%，优于GPT4O等模型，但多跳性能普遍下降。

Conclusion: BioHopR为生物医学多跳推理设定了新标准，揭示了专有与开源模型的差距，推动未来LLM发展。

Abstract: Biomedical reasoning often requires traversing interconnected relationships
across entities such as drugs, diseases, and proteins. Despite the increasing
prominence of large language models (LLMs), existing benchmarks lack the
ability to evaluate multi-hop reasoning in the biomedical domain, particularly
for queries involving one-to-many and many-to-many relationships. This gap
leaves the critical challenges of biomedical multi-hop reasoning underexplored.
To address this, we introduce BioHopR, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
multi-hop, multi-answer reasoning in structured biomedical knowledge graphs.
Built from the comprehensive PrimeKG, BioHopR includes 1-hop and 2-hop
reasoning tasks that reflect real-world biomedical complexities.
  Evaluations of state-of-the-art models reveal that O3-mini, a proprietary
reasoning-focused model, achieves 37.93% precision on 1-hop tasks and 14.57% on
2-hop tasks, outperforming proprietary models such as GPT4O and open-source
biomedical models including HuatuoGPT-o1-70B and Llama-3.3-70B. However, all
models exhibit significant declines in multi-hop performance, underscoring the
challenges of resolving implicit reasoning steps in the biomedical domain. By
addressing the lack of benchmarks for multi-hop reasoning in biomedical domain,
BioHopR sets a new standard for evaluating reasoning capabilities and
highlights critical gaps between proprietary and open-source models while
paving the way for future advancements in biomedical LLMs.

open source LLMs and fine grained optimized prompts for each task (step). With
this approach, we achieved a score of $70.50\%$ for subtask 1.

Conclusion: Fragment-Shot Prompting对低资源语言翻译有效，推理能力强的模型表现更优。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
multilingual machine translation, sometimes even outperforming traditional

using LLMs, particularly with prompt engineering, for low-resource languages.
In this work, we introduce Fragment-Shot Prompting, a novel in-context learning
method that segments input and retrieves translation examples based on
syntactic coverage, along with Pivoted Fragment-Shot, an extension that enables
translation without direct parallel data. We evaluate these methods using
GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, o1-mini, LLaMA-3.3, and DeepSeek-R1 for translation between
Italian and two Ladin variants, revealing three key findings: (1) Fragment-Shot
Prompting is effective for translating into and between the studied
low-resource languages, with syntactic coverage positively correlating with
translation quality; (2) Models with stronger reasoning abilities make more
effective use of retrieved knowledge, generally produce better translations,
and enable Pivoted Fragment-Shot to significantly improve translation quality
between the Ladin variants; and (3) prompt engineering offers limited, if any,
improvements when translating from a low-resource to a high-resource language,
where zero-shot prompting already yields satisfactory results. We publicly

Result: 实验表明，ToxEdit在解毒性能和保留模型一般能力上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ToxEdit通过动态毒性检测和自适应路径设计，实现了更精确的解毒效果，同时避免了过度编辑问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive language capabilities but
remain vulnerable to malicious prompts and jailbreaking attacks. Existing
knowledge editing methods for LLM detoxification face two major challenges.
First, they often rely on entity-specific localization, making them ineffective
against adversarial inputs without explicit entities. Second, these methods
suffer from over-editing, where detoxified models reject legitimate queries,
compromising overall performance. In this paper, we propose ToxEdit, a
toxicity-aware knowledge editing approach that dynamically detects toxic
activation patterns during forward propagation. It then routes computations
through adaptive inter-layer pathways to mitigate toxicity effectively. This
design ensures precise toxicity mitigation while preserving LLMs' general
capabilities. To more accurately assess over-editing, we also enhance the
SafeEdit benchmark by incorporating instruction-following evaluation tasks.
Experimental results on multiple LLMs demonstrate that our ToxEdit outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods in both detoxification performance and
safeguarding general capabilities of LLMs.

Method: 引入CounterLogic数据集，评估11种LLMs在6个数据集上的表现，并提出Self-Segregate提示方法。

Result: LLMs在反事实情境下平均准确率下降27%，Self-Segregate方法将差距缩小至11%，整体准确率提升7.5%。

Conclusion: 研究为理解和增强LLMs在实际应用中的逻辑推理能力提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities in
familiar contexts, but struggle when the context conflicts with their
parametric knowledge. To investigate this phenomenon, we introduce
CounterLogic, a dataset containing 1,800 examples across 9 logical schemas,
explicitly designed to evaluate logical reasoning through counterfactual
(hypothetical knowledge-conflicting) scenarios. Our systematic evaluation of 11
LLMs across 6 different datasets reveals a consistent performance degradation,
with accuracies dropping by 27% on average when reasoning through
counterfactual information. We propose Self-Segregate, a prompting method
enabling metacognitive awareness (explicitly identifying knowledge conflicts)
before reasoning. Our method dramatically narrows the average performance gaps
from 27% to just 11%, while significantly increasing the overall accuracy
(+7.5%). We discuss the implications of these findings and draw parallels to
human cognitive processes, particularly on how humans disambiguate conflicting
information during reasoning tasks. Our findings offer practical insights for
understanding and enhancing LLMs reasoning capabilities in real-world
applications, especially where models must logically reason independently of
their factual knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE模型中辅助负载均衡损失导致专家重叠和路由过于均匀，影响专家专业化和性能。

Method: 提出两种互补目标：正交性损失（鼓励专家处理不同类型标记）和方差损失（鼓励更具区分性的路由决策）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升专家专业化，性能提升达23.79%，同时保持下游任务的负载均衡。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，无需架构修改或额外组件，显著优化MoE模型性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable efficient scaling of large language
models (LLMs) by activating only a subset of experts per input. However, we
observe that the commonly used auxiliary load balancing loss often leads to
expert overlap and overly uniform routing, which hinders expert specialization
and degrades overall performance during post-training. To address this, we
propose a simple yet effective solution that introduces two complementary
objectives: (1) an orthogonality loss to encourage experts to process distinct
types of tokens, and (2) a variance loss to encourage more discriminative
routing decisions. Gradient-level analysis demonstrates that these objectives
are compatible with the existing auxiliary loss and contribute to optimizing
the training process. Experimental results over various model architectures and
across multiple benchmarks show that our method significantly enhances expert
specialization. Notably, our method improves classic MoE baselines with

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段方法（监督微调+强化学习）来提升多模态语言模型的推理能力，显著优于单一方法，并在多个基准测试中达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RL在多模态语言模型中表现出自修正能力，但研究发现这些能力在RL训练前已存在，且不一定提升推理性能，因此探索更有效的方法。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 监督微调（SFT）作为冷启动，引入结构化思维链；2) 使用GRPO强化学习进一步优化。

Result: 3B和7B模型在MathVista和We-Math等基准测试中显著提升（如7B模型从66.3%到73.4%），3B模型性能接近部分7B模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建先进多模态推理模型提供了实用指导，两阶段方法效果显著。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities, with reinforcement learning
(RL) playing a crucial role in this progress. While "aha moment"
patterns--where models exhibit self-correction through reflection--are often
attributed to emergent properties from RL, we first demonstrate that these
patterns exist in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) prior to RL training but may not
necessarily correlate with improved reasoning performance. Building on these
insights, we present a comprehensive study on enhancing multimodal reasoning
through a two-stage approach: (1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start
with structured chain-of-thought reasoning patterns, followed by (2)
reinforcement learning via GRPO to further refine these capabilities. Our
extensive experiments show that this combined approach consistently outperforms
both SFT-only and RL-only methods across challenging multimodal reasoning
benchmarks. The resulting models achieve state-of-the-art performance among
open-source MLLMs at both 3B and 7B scales, with our 7B model showing
substantial improvements over base models (e.g., 66.3 %$\rightarrow$73.4 % on
MathVista, 62.9 %$\rightarrow$70.4 % on We-Math) and our 3B model achieving
performance competitive with several 7B models. Overall, this work provides
practical guidance for building advanced multimodal reasoning models. Our code

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Text2Grad将自由形式的文本反馈转化为细粒度的梯度信号，直接优化语言模型的策略，显著提升任务指标和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLHF使用粗粒度的标量奖励，掩盖了成功或失败的细节，导致学习缓慢且不透明。Text2Grad旨在通过文本反馈实现细粒度的策略优化。

Method: Text2Grad通过三个组件实现：(1) 反馈标注管道，将批评与相关token跨度配对；(2) 细粒度奖励模型，预测跨度级奖励并生成解释性批评；(3) 跨度级策略优化器，反向传播自然语言梯度。

Result: 在摘要、代码生成和问答任务中，Text2Grad优于标量奖励RL和仅提示的基线方法，任务指标更高且可解释性更强。

Conclusion: 自然语言反馈转化为梯度信号是一种强大的细粒度策略优化方法。

Abstract: Traditional RLHF optimizes language models with coarse, scalar rewards that
mask the fine-grained reasons behind success or failure, leading to slow and
opaque learning. Recent work augments RL with textual critiques through
prompting or reflection, improving interpretability but leaving model
parameters untouched. We introduce Text2Grad, a reinforcement-learning paradigm
that turns free-form textual feedback into span-level gradients. Given human
(or programmatic) critiques, Text2Grad aligns each feedback phrase with the
relevant token spans, converts these alignments into differentiable reward
signals, and performs gradient updates that directly refine the offending
portions of the model's policy. This yields precise, feedback-conditioned
adjustments instead of global nudges. Text2Grad is realized through three
components: (1) a high-quality feedback-annotation pipeline that pairs
critiques with token spans; (2) a fine-grained reward model that predicts
span-level reward on answer while generating explanatory critiques; and (3) a
span-level policy optimizer that back-propagates natural-language gradients.
Across summarization, code generation, and question answering, Text2Grad
consistently surpasses scalar-reward RL and prompt-only baselines, providing
both higher task metrics and richer interpretability. Our results demonstrate
that natural-language feedback, when converted to gradients, is a powerful
signal for fine-grained policy optimization. The code for our method is
available at https://github.com/microsoft/Text2Grad

TL;DR: 研究探讨LLMs如何处理错误预设，发现其在识别和纠正错误预设方面存在困难，尤其在政治语境中表现不一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 错误预设可能嵌入误导信息，研究LLMs对此的敏感性有助于揭示其传播错误信息的风险。

Method: 基于语言学预设分析，通过新数据集测试GPT-4-o、LLama-3-8B和Mistral-7B-v03在不同条件下的表现。

Result: LLMs难以识别错误预设，表现因条件（如语言构造、政治背景）而异。

Conclusion: 语言学预设分析是揭示LLMs强化政治错误信息的有效工具。

Abstract: This paper examines how LLMs handle false presuppositions and whether certain
linguistic factors influence their responses to falsely presupposed content.
Presuppositions subtly introduce information as given, making them highly
effective at embedding disputable or false information. This raises concerns
about whether LLMs, like humans, may fail to detect and correct misleading
assumptions introduced as false presuppositions, even when the stakes of
misinformation are high. Using a systematic approach based on linguistic
presupposition analysis, we investigate the conditions under which LLMs are
more or less sensitive to adopt or reject false presuppositions. Focusing on
political contexts, we examine how factors like linguistic construction,
political party, and scenario probability impact the recognition of false
presuppositions. We conduct experiments with a newly created dataset and
examine three LLMs: OpenAI's GPT-4-o, Meta's LLama-3-8B, and MistralAI's
Mistral-7B-v03. Our results show that the models struggle to recognize false
presuppositions, with performance varying by condition. This study highlights
that linguistic presupposition analysis is a valuable tool for uncovering the
reinforcement of political misinformation in LLM responses.

Motivation: 解决现有推理优化LLM中计算成本高和推理延迟的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练框架：第一阶段通过迭代蒸馏和强化学习优化模型；第二阶段引入双系统框架，支持快速和慢速推理模式。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，7B参数的Pangu Embedded优于同类模型，提供快速响应和高质量推理。

Conclusion: Pangu Embedded展示了开发强大且实用的LLM推理器的潜力。

Abstract: This work presents Pangu Embedded, an efficient Large Language Model (LLM)
reasoner developed on Ascend Neural Processing Units (NPUs), featuring flexible
fast and slow thinking capabilities. Pangu Embedded addresses the significant
computational costs and inference latency challenges prevalent in existing
reasoning-optimized LLMs. We propose a two-stage training framework for its
construction. In Stage 1, the model is finetuned via an iterative distillation
process, incorporating inter-iteration model merging to effectively aggregate
complementary knowledge. This is followed by reinforcement learning on Ascend
clusters, optimized by a latency-tolerant scheduler that combines stale
synchronous parallelism with prioritized data queues. The RL process is guided
by a Multi-source Adaptive Reward System (MARS), which generates dynamic,
task-specific reward signals using deterministic metrics and lightweight LLM
evaluators for mathematics, coding, and general problem-solving tasks. Stage 2
introduces a dual-system framework, endowing Pangu Embedded with a "fast" mode
for routine queries and a deeper "slow" mode for complex inference. This
framework offers both manual mode switching for user control and an automatic,
complexity-aware mode selection mechanism that dynamically allocates
computational resources to balance latency and reasoning depth. Experimental
results on benchmarks including AIME 2024, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench demonstrate
that Pangu Embedded with 7B parameters, outperforms similar-size models like
Qwen3-8B and GLM4-9B. It delivers rapid responses and state-of-the-art
reasoning quality within a single, unified model architecture, highlighting a
promising direction for developing powerful yet practically deployable LLM
reasoners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的评估框架依赖资源密集型模型和多阶段提示，计算成本高且未充分利用模型的推理能力。

Method: 采用强化学习训练评估器，通过排名奖励机制和零人工标注生成质量控制的响应。

Result: RAG-Zeval在性能上优于基线方法，与人类判断的相关性最强，且具有更好的可解释性。

Conclusion: RAG-Zeval提供了一种高效、可解释的RAG系统评估方法，显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Robust evaluation is critical for deploying trustworthy retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) systems. However, current LLM-based evaluation frameworks
predominantly rely on directly prompting resource-intensive models with complex
multi-stage prompts, underutilizing models' reasoning capabilities and
introducing significant computational cost. In this paper, we present RAG-Zeval
(RAG-Zero Evaluator), a novel end-to-end framework that formulates faithfulness
and correctness evaluation as a rule-guided reasoning task. Our approach trains
evaluators with reinforcement learning, facilitating compact models to generate
comprehensive and sound assessments with detailed explanation in one-pass. We
introduce a ranking-based outcome reward mechanism, using preference judgments
rather than absolute scores, to address the challenge of obtaining precise
pointwise reward signals. To this end, we synthesize the ranking references by
generating quality-controlled responses with zero human annotation. Experiments
demonstrate RAG-Zeval's superior performance, achieving the strongest
correlation with human judgments and outperforming baselines that rely on LLMs
with 10-100 times more parameters. Our approach also exhibits superior
interpretability in response evaluation.

TL;DR: MM-UPT是一种基于GRPO的无监督后训练框架，通过自奖励机制提升多模态大语言模型的推理能力，无需外部监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督方法依赖昂贵的人工标注数据，而无监督方法复杂且难以迭代。

Method: 提出MM-UPT框架，利用GRPO算法和基于多数投票的自奖励机制进行无监督训练。

Result: 在MathVista和We-Math数据集上显著提升模型性能，接近监督方法效果。

Conclusion: MM-UPT为多模态大语言模型的持续自主增强提供了新范式。

Abstract: Improving Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the post-training
stage typically relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement
learning (RL). However, these supervised methods require expensive and manually
annotated multi-modal data--an ultimately unsustainable resource. While recent
efforts have explored unsupervised post-training, their methods are complex and
difficult to iterate. In this work, we are the first to investigate the use of
GRPO, a stable and scalable online RL algorithm, for enabling continual
self-improvement without any external supervision. We propose MM-UPT, a simple
yet effective framework for unsupervised post-training of MLLMs. MM-UPT builds
upon GRPO, replacing traditional reward signals with a self-rewarding mechanism
based on majority voting over multiple sampled responses. Our experiments
demonstrate that MM-UPT significantly improves the reasoning ability of
Qwen2.5-VL-7B (e.g., 66.3 %$\rightarrow$72.9 % on MathVista, 62.9
%$\rightarrow$68.7 % on We-Math), using standard dataset without ground truth
labels. MM-UPT also outperforms prior unsupervised baselines and even
approaches the results of supervised GRPO. Furthermore, we show that
incorporating synthetic questions, generated solely by MLLM itself, can boost
performance as well, highlighting a promising approach for scalable
self-improvement. Overall, MM-UPT offers a new paradigm for continual,
autonomous enhancement of MLLMs in the absence of external supervision. Our
code is available at https://github.com/waltonfuture/MM-UPT.

Result: 在七个多跳问答基准测试中，性能平均提升4.7%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EvolveSearch为开放网络搜索领域的自进化能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the
landscape of agentic information seeking capabilities through the integration
of tools such as search engines and web browsers. However, current mainstream
approaches for enabling LLM web search proficiency face significant challenges:
supervised fine-tuning struggles with data production in open-search domains,
while RL converges quickly, limiting their data utilization efficiency. To
address these issues, we propose EvolveSearch, a novel iterative self-evolution
framework that combines SFT and RL to enhance agentic web search capabilities
without any external human-annotated reasoning data. Extensive experiments on
seven multi-hop question-answering (MHQA) benchmarks demonstrate that
EvolveSearch consistently improves performance across iterations, ultimately
achieving an average improvement of 4.7\% over the current state-of-the-art
across seven benchmarks, opening the door to self-evolution agentic
capabilities in open web search domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量标注数据或昂贵的GPT模型调用，难以在低资源场景下应用。本文旨在以更高效的方式提升小型MLLMs的性能。

Method: 通过提示多个教师MLLMs生成预测和解释，作为知识源；采用两阶段蒸馏框架（LoRA微调和DPO）将知识迁移到学生模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法仅需不到10%的标注数据即可达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在减少资源消耗的同时显著提升了小型MLLMs的性能，适用于低资源场景。

Abstract: Multimodal out-of-context news is a type of misinformation in which the image
is used outside of its original context. Many existing works have leveraged
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for detecting out-of-context news.
However, observing the limited zero-shot performance of smaller MLLMs, they
generally require label-rich fine-tuning and/or expensive API calls to GPT
models to improve the performance, which is impractical in low-resource
scenarios. In contrast, we aim to improve the performance of small MLLMs in a
more label-efficient and cost-effective manner. To this end, we first prompt
multiple teacher MLLMs to generate both label predictions and corresponding
rationales, which collectively serve as the teachers' knowledge. We then
introduce a two-stage knowledge distillation framework to transfer this
knowledge to a student MLLM. In Stage 1, we apply LoRA fine-tuning to the
student model using all training data. In Stage 2, we further fine-tune the
student model using both LoRA fine-tuning and DPO on the data points where
teachers' predictions conflict. This two-stage strategy reduces annotation
costs and helps the student model uncover subtle patterns in more challenging
cases. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance using less than 10% labeled data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前固定长度的CoT推理方法无法适应情感任务的复杂性，需要动态调整推理深度。

Method: 结合微调和强化学习，设计复合奖励函数，平衡准确性、推理深度、路径多样性和逻辑重复性。

Result: 在情感、情绪、幽默和讽刺任务中，F1和准确率均有提升，高级任务提升尤为显著。

Conclusion: 通过自适应深度分析，填补了固定CoT推理与情感复杂性之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: Emotion understanding includes basic tasks (e.g., sentiment/emotion
classification) and advanced tasks (e.g., sarcasm/humor detection). Current
methods rely on fixed-length CoT reasoning, failing to adapt to the varying
complexity of emotions. We propose a task-adaptive reasoning framework that
employs DeepSeek-R1 to generate variable-length reasoning chains for different
emotion tasks. By combining fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, we design
a composite reward function that balances four objectives: prediction accuracy,
adaptive reasoning depth control, structural diversity in reasoning paths, and
suppression of repetitive logic. This approach achieves dynamic
context-sensitive inference while enabling LLMs to autonomously develop deep
reasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate consistent
improvements in both Acc and F1 scores across four tasks: emotion, sentiment,
humor, and sarcasm. Notably, peak enhancements reached 3.56% F1 (2.76% Acc) for
basic tasks and 37.95% F1 (23.14% Acc) for advanced tasks. Our work bridges
rigid CoT reasoning and emotional complexity through adaptive-depth analysis.

TL;DR: ClaimPKG框架通过结合知识图谱（KGs）与大型语言模型（LLMs）提升声明验证的推理能力，实现了端到端的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有验证方法依赖非结构化文本，难以有效利用KGs的结构化知识；LLMs在多步推理和KG处理方面存在不足。

Method: ClaimPKG使用轻量级LLM生成伪子图指导子图检索，再由通用LLM处理子图生成最终结果。

Result: 在FactKG数据集上，ClaimPKG性能优于基线9%-12%，并在非结构化数据集上展示零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: ClaimPKG成功整合KGs与LLMs，显著提升了声明验证的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) is an emerging research challenge in claim
verification. While KGs provide structured, semantically rich representations
well-suited for reasoning, most existing verification methods rely on
unstructured text corpora, limiting their ability to effectively leverage KGs.
Additionally, despite possessing strong reasoning abilities, modern LLMs
struggle with multi-step modular pipelines and reasoning over KGs without
adaptation. To address these challenges, we propose ClaimPKG, an end-to-end
framework that seamlessly integrates LLM reasoning with structured knowledge
from KGs. Specifically, the main idea of ClaimPKG is to employ a lightweight,
specialized LLM to represent the input claim as pseudo-subgraphs, guiding a
dedicated subgraph retrieval module to identify relevant KG subgraphs. These
retrieved subgraphs are then processed by a general-purpose LLM to produce the
final verdict and justification. Extensive experiments on the FactKG dataset
demonstrate that ClaimPKG achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming
strong baselines in this research field by 9%-12% accuracy points across
multiple categories. Furthermore, ClaimPKG exhibits zero-shot generalizability
to unstructured datasets such as HoVer and FEVEROUS, effectively combining
structured knowledge from KGs with LLM reasoning across various LLM backbones.

Conclusion: LLMs的表征架构在性能提升过程中逐渐与大脑的语言处理层次对齐。

Abstract: Understanding whether large language models (LLMs) and the human brain
converge on similar computational principles remains a fundamental and
important question in cognitive neuroscience and AI. Do the brain-like patterns
observed in LLMs emerge simply from scaling, or do they reflect deeper
alignment with the architecture of human language processing? This study
focuses on the sentence-level neural mechanisms of language models,
systematically investigating how hierarchical representations in LLMs align
with the dynamic neural responses during human sentence comprehension. By
comparing hierarchical embeddings from 14 publicly available LLMs with fMRI
data collected from participants, who were exposed to a naturalistic narrative
story, we constructed sentence-level neural prediction models to precisely
identify the model layers most significantly correlated with brain region
activations. Results show that improvements in model performance drive the
evolution of representational architectures toward brain-like hierarchies,
particularly achieving stronger functional and anatomical correspondence at
higher semantic abstraction levels.

Conclusion: Agent-UniRAG提升了RAG系统的效果和可解释性，且适用于小规模LLM。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for unified retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) systems using the recent emerging large language model (LLM)
agent concept. Specifically, Agent LLM, which utilizes LLM as fundamental
controllers, has become a promising approach to enable the interpretability of
RAG tasks, especially for complex reasoning question-answering systems (e.g.,
multi-hop queries). Nonetheless, previous works mainly focus on solving RAG
systems with either single-hop or multi-hop approaches separately, which limits
the application of those approaches to real-world applications. In this study,
we propose a trainable agent framework called Agent-UniRAG for unified
retrieval-augmented LLM systems, which enhances the effectiveness and
interpretability of RAG systems. The main idea is to design an LLM agent
framework to solve RAG tasks step-by-step based on the complexity of the
inputs, simultaneously including single-hop and multi-hop queries in an
end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we introduce SynAgent-RAG, a synthetic dataset
to enable the proposed agent framework for small open-source LLMs (e.g.,
Llama-3-8B). The results show comparable performances with closed-source and
larger open-source LLMs across various RAG benchmarks. Our source code and
dataset are publicly available for further exploitation.

Motivation: 传统方法局限于单层或固定层操作，无法灵活调整，Fusion Steering旨在通过动态、分层的激活控制改进事实准确性和流畅性。

Method: 采用动态注入提示特定的激活增量，优化权重以平衡事实对齐和流畅性，评估采用综合评分标准。

Result: 在260个SimpleQA提示上，分段导向的准确率达25.4%，显著优于基线（3.5%）和全层导向（16.2%）。

Conclusion: 分段动态干预策略有效，展示了全网络激活控制的潜力，并适用于稀疏表示，为可解释和可扩展的LLM控制提供了方向。

Abstract: We present Fusion Steering, an activation steering methodology that improves
factual accuracy in large language models (LLMs) for question-answering (QA)
tasks. This approach introduces flexible steering configurations, including
full-layer steering and segmented steering. Unlike traditional methods
constrained to single-layer or fixed-layer operations, Fusion Steering employs
dynamic injection of prompt-specific activation deltas across all transformer
layers. These activation deltas are derived from reference completions that
combine the ground-truth answer with a model-generated explanation to
facilitate semantically enriched, example-specific steering. The injection
weights are optimized per prompt using Optuna, targeting a joint objective that
balances token overlap (factual alignment) and perplexity (fluency proxy).
Evaluation employs a composite score integrating token overlap and LLM-graded
quality, encompassing factual accuracy, coherence, and relevance. Empirical
results on 260 SimpleQA prompts (selected from 500 where the baseline failed)
showcase the efficacy of segmented steering. Using Gemma-2-2B-IT with 8-bit
quantization, segmented steering achieves an accuracy of 25.4% (outputs scoring
$\geq 0.6$), outperforming the baseline at 3.5% and full-layer steering at
16.2%. Under the stricter SimpleQA rubric, segmented steering boosts fully
correct responses from 0.0% to 13.1%. These findings highlight the strengths of
segmented, dynamic intervention strategies and the promise of per-prompt,
full-network activation control. Fusion Steering is also amenable to sparse
representations, such as Neuronpedia or sparse crosscoders, suggesting a
promising direction for interpretable and scalable activation-level control in
LLMs.

Abstract: Continually expanding new languages for existing large language models (LLMs)
is a promising yet challenging approach to building powerful multilingual LLMs.
The biggest challenge is to make the model continuously learn new languages
while preserving the proficient ability of old languages. To achieve this,
recent work utilizes the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture to expand new
languages by adding new experts and avoid catastrophic forgetting of old
languages by routing corresponding tokens to the original model backbone (old
experts). Although intuitive, this kind of method is parameter-costly when
expanding new languages and still inevitably impacts the performance of old
languages. To address these limitations, we analyze the language
characteristics of different layers in LLMs and propose a layer-wise expert
allocation algorithm (LayerMoE) to determine the appropriate number of new
experts for each layer. Specifically, we find different layers in LLMs exhibit
different representation similarities between languages and then utilize the
similarity as the indicator to allocate experts for each layer, i.e., the
higher similarity, the fewer experts. Additionally, to further mitigate the
forgetting of old languages, we add a classifier in front of the router network
on the layers with higher similarity to guide the routing of old language
tokens. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art baseline with 60% fewer experts in the single-expansion
setting and with 33.3% fewer experts in the lifelong-expansion setting,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: PISCES是一种新框架，通过直接编辑参数空间中的方向，精确地从大语言模型中删除不需要的概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如微调或低秩适配器）在删除敏感或受版权保护的知识时效果不佳，PISCES旨在提供更精确的解决方案。

Method: PISCES使用解缠模型分解MLP向量为可解释特征，通过自动解释技术识别目标概念，并从参数中删除这些特征。

Result: 在Gemma 2和Llama 3.1上的实验显示，PISCES将目标概念的准确率降至7.7%，同时显著提升了删除的特异性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PISCES通过基于特征的参数编辑，为语言模型中的知识删除提供了更精确和可靠的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often acquire knowledge during pretraining that
is undesirable in downstream deployments, e.g., sensitive information or
copyrighted content. Existing approaches for removing such knowledge rely on
fine-tuning, training low-rank adapters or fact-level editing, but these are
either too coarse, too shallow, or ineffective. In this work, we propose PISCES
(Precise In-parameter Suppression for Concept EraSure), a novel framework for
precisely erasing entire concepts from model parameters by directly editing
directions that encode them in parameter space. PISCES uses a disentangler
model to decompose MLP vectors into interpretable features, identifies those
associated with a target concept using automated interpretability techniques,
and removes them from model parameters. Experiments on Gemma 2 and Llama 3.1
over various concepts show that PISCES achieves modest gains in efficacy over
leading erasure methods, reducing accuracy on the target concept to as low as
7.7%, while dramatically improving erasure specificity (by up to 31%) and
robustness (by up to 38%). Overall, these results demonstrate that
feature-based in-parameter editing enables a more precise and reliable approach
for removing conceptual knowledge in language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在数学推理中存在许多错误案例，现有方法仅从孤立案例中学习，缺乏对错误模式的泛化能力。

Method: SEI框架通过识别错误案例、生成错误关键词、聚类错误类型，并利用GPT-4o生成针对性训练数据，再通过单样本学习优化数据。

Result: 实验表明，SEI框架能提升模型在数学推理任务中的表现，包括领域内和领域外数据集。

Conclusion: SEI通过错误泛化有效提升大语言模型的数学推理能力。

Abstract: Although large language models demonstrate strong performance across various
domains, they still struggle with numerous bad cases in mathematical reasoning.
Previous approaches to learning from errors synthesize training data by solely
extrapolating from isolated bad cases, thereby failing to generalize the
extensive patterns inherent within these cases. This paper presents
Self-Error-Instruct (SEI), a framework that addresses these model weaknesses
and synthesizes more generalized targeted training data. Specifically, we
explore a target model on two mathematical datasets, GSM8K and MATH, to
pinpoint bad cases. Then, we generate error keyphrases for these cases based on
the instructor model's (GPT-4o) analysis and identify error types by clustering
these keyphrases. Next, we sample a few bad cases during each generation for
each identified error type and input them into the instructor model, which
synthesizes additional training data using a self-instruct approach. This new
data is refined through a one-shot learning process to ensure that only the
most effective examples are kept. Finally, we use these curated data to
fine-tune the target model, iteratively repeating the process to enhance
performance. We apply our framework to various models and observe improvements
in their reasoning abilities across both in-domain and out-of-domain
mathematics datasets. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of self-error
instruction in improving LLMs' mathematical reasoning through error
generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源扩散LLMs的实际推理速度落后于自回归模型，且并行解码时质量下降，需解决这些问题以推动实际应用。

Method: 引入块状近似KV缓存机制以减少性能损失，并提出置信感知并行解码策略以解决并行解码中的依赖破坏问题。

Result: 实验显示，在多个LLM基准测试中，吞吐量提升高达27.6倍，且精度损失极小。

Conclusion: 该方法缩小了扩散LLMs与自回归模型的性能差距，为其实际部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (Diffusion LLMs) have shown promise for
non-autoregressive text generation with parallel decoding capabilities.
However, the practical inference speed of open-sourced Diffusion LLMs often
lags behind autoregressive models due to the lack of Key-Value (KV) Cache and
quality degradation when decoding multiple tokens simultaneously. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel block-wise approximate KV Cache mechanism
tailored for bidirectional diffusion models, enabling cache reuse with
negligible performance drop. Additionally, we identify the root cause of
generation quality degradation in parallel decoding as the disruption of token
dependencies under the conditional independence assumption. To address this, we
propose a confidence-aware parallel decoding strategy that selectively decodes
tokens exceeding a confidence threshold, mitigating dependency violations and
maintaining generation quality. Experimental results on LLaDA and Dream models
across multiple LLM benchmarks demonstrate up to \textbf{27.6$\times$
throughput} improvement with minimal accuracy loss, closing the performance gap
with autoregressive models and paving the way for practical deployment of
Diffusion LLMs.

Conclusion: CoTalk在标注效率和实用性上表现优异，为视觉-语言对齐任务提供了更高效的标注解决方案。

Abstract: While densely annotated image captions significantly facilitate the learning
of robust vision-language alignment, methodologies for systematically
optimizing human annotation efforts remain underexplored. We introduce
Chain-of-Talkers (CoTalk), an AI-in-the-loop methodology designed to maximize
the number of annotated samples and improve their comprehensiveness under fixed
budget constraints (e.g., total human annotation time). The framework is built
upon two key insights. First, sequential annotation reduces redundant workload
compared to conventional parallel annotation, as subsequent annotators only
need to annotate the ``residual'' -- the missing visual information that
previous annotations have not covered. Second, humans process textual input
faster by reading while outputting annotations with much higher throughput via
talking; thus a multimodal interface enables optimized efficiency. We evaluate
our framework from two aspects: intrinsic evaluations that assess the
comprehensiveness of semantic units, obtained by parsing detailed captions into
object-attribute trees and analyzing their effective connections; extrinsic
evaluation measures the practical usage of the annotated captions in
facilitating vision-language alignment. Experiments with eight participants
show our Chain-of-Talkers (CoTalk) improves annotation speed (0.42 vs. 0.30
units/sec) and retrieval performance (41.13\% vs. 40.52\%) over the parallel
method.

Result: 发现错误源于一种称为“基于类的（错误）泛化”机制，模型内部存在两种竞争电路，影响最终输出。

Conclusion: LLMs通过形式化训练表现出基于上下文的不可靠泛化能力，被称为“随机变色龙”。

Abstract: The widespread success of large language models (LLMs) on NLP benchmarks has
been accompanied by concerns that LLMs function primarily as stochastic parrots
that reproduce texts similar to what they saw during pre-training, often
erroneously. But what is the nature of their errors, and do these errors
exhibit any regularities? In this work, we examine irrelevant context
hallucinations, in which models integrate misleading contextual cues into their
predictions. Through behavioral analysis, we show that these errors result from
a structured yet flawed mechanism that we term class-based (mis)generalization,
in which models combine abstract class cues with features extracted from the
query or context to derive answers. Furthermore, mechanistic interpretability
experiments on Llama-3, Mistral, and Pythia across 39 factual recall relation
types reveal that this behavior is reflected in the model's internal
computations: (i) abstract class representations are constructed in lower
layers before being refined into specific answers in higher layers, (ii)
feature selection is governed by two competing circuits -- one prioritizing
direct query-based reasoning, the other incorporating contextual cues -- whose
relative influences determine the final output. Our findings provide a more
nuanced perspective on the stochastic parrot argument: through form-based
training, LLMs can exhibit generalization leveraging abstractions, albeit in
unreliable ways based on contextual cues -- what we term stochastic chameleons.

Result: 实验表明，合成数据显著提升了MLLMs的空间感知和推理能力，并展现出强泛化性。

Conclusion: 基于知识的数据合成方法有望推动空间智能的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly enhanced their capabilities; however, their spatial perception
abilities remain a notable limitation. To address this challenge, multimodal
data synthesis offers a promising solution. Yet, ensuring that synthesized data
adhere to spatial common sense is a non-trivial task. In this work, we
introduce SKG2Data, a novel multimodal synthesis approach guided by spatial
knowledge graphs, grounded in the concept of knowledge-to-data generation.
SKG2Data automatically constructs a Spatial Knowledge Graph (SKG) to emulate
human-like perception of spatial directions and distances, which is
subsequently utilized to guide multimodal data synthesis. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that data synthesized from diverse types of spatial knowledge,
including direction and distance, not only enhance the spatial perception and
reasoning abilities of MLLMs but also exhibit strong generalization
capabilities. We hope that the idea of knowledge-based data synthesis can
advance the development of spatial intelligence.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖标注的CoT数据，成本高且泛化能力有限，希望模型能组合原子推理技能解决更复杂任务。

Method: 提出可组合CoT格式，结合多任务学习或模型融合，并通过拒绝采样微调（RFT）进一步优化。

Result: 在字符串操作和自然语言技能组合任务上，可组合CoT训练优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 改进CoT格式能有效提升模型组合泛化能力，为无标注数据的复杂任务提供解决方案。

Abstract: A common approach for teaching large language models (LLMs) to reason is to
train on chain-of-thought (CoT) traces of in-distribution reasoning problems,
but such annotated data is costly to obtain for every problem of interest. We
want reasoning models to generalize beyond their training distribution, and
ideally to generalize compositionally: combine atomic reasoning skills to solve
harder, unseen reasoning tasks. We take a step towards compositional
generalization of reasoning skills when addressing a target compositional task
that has no labeled CoT data. We find that simply training models on CoT data
of atomic tasks leads to limited generalization, but minimally modifying CoT
formats of constituent atomic tasks to be composable can lead to improvements.
We can train "atomic CoT" models on the atomic tasks with Composable CoT data
and combine them with multitask learning or model merging for better zero-shot
performance on the target compositional task. Such a combined model can be
further bootstrapped on a small amount of compositional data using rejection
sampling fine-tuning (RFT). Results on string operations and natural language
skill compositions show that training LLMs on Composable CoT outperforms
multitask learning and continued fine-tuning baselines within a given training
data budget.

Motivation: 了解LLM在简体中文和繁体中文提示下的表现差异，以避免文化偏见和下游决策危害。

Method: 设计两项基准任务（区域术语选择和区域名称选择），测试11种LLM的性能。

Result: LLM在区域术语选择中偏向简体中文，而在区域名称选择中偏向繁体中文。差异源于训练数据、字符偏好和分词方式。

Conclusion: 需进一步分析LLM偏见，提供开源基准数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: While the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have been studied in
both Simplified and Traditional Chinese, it is yet unclear whether LLMs exhibit
differential performance when prompted in these two variants of written
Chinese. This understanding is critical, as disparities in the quality of LLM
responses can perpetuate representational harms by ignoring the different
cultural contexts underlying Simplified versus Traditional Chinese, and can
exacerbate downstream harms in LLM-facilitated decision-making in domains such
as education or hiring. To investigate potential LLM performance disparities,
we design two benchmark tasks that reflect real-world scenarios: regional term
choice (prompting the LLM to name a described item which is referred to
differently in Mainland China and Taiwan), and regional name choice (prompting
the LLM to choose who to hire from a list of names in both Simplified and
Traditional Chinese). For both tasks, we audit the performance of 11 leading
commercial LLM services and open-sourced models -- spanning those primarily
trained on English, Simplified Chinese, or Traditional Chinese. Our analyses
indicate that biases in LLM responses are dependent on both the task and
prompting language: while most LLMs disproportionately favored Simplified
Chinese responses in the regional term choice task, they surprisingly favored
Traditional Chinese names in the regional name choice task. We find that these
disparities may arise from differences in training data representation, written
character preferences, and tokenization of Simplified and Traditional Chinese.
These findings highlight the need for further analysis of LLM biases; as such,
we provide an open-sourced benchmark dataset to foster reproducible evaluations
of future LLM behavior across Chinese language variants
(https://github.com/brucelyu17/SC-TC-Bench).

exemplified by Deep Research, underscores the potential for autonomous

end-to-end agentic information seeking agents from a data-centric and
training-stage perspective. Our approach consists of four key stages: (1)
browsing data construction, (2) trajectories sampling, (3) supervised
fine-tuning for effective cold start, and (4) reinforcement learning for
enhanced generalisation. We instantiate this framework in a web agent based on
the ReAct, WebDancer. Empirical evaluations on the challenging information
seeking benchmarks, GAIA and WebWalkerQA, demonstrate the strong performance of
WebDancer, achieving considerable results and highlighting the efficacy of our
training paradigm. Further analysis of agent training provides valuable
insights and actionable, systematic pathways for developing more capable
agentic models. The codes and demo will be released in

Motivation: 研究动机是探索实际场景中奖励噪声对LLM后训练的影响，特别是推理任务中奖励模型的实用性。

Method: 通过手动翻转奖励函数输出（如40%噪声）和仅奖励关键推理短语（RPR）来评估模型性能。

Result: Qwen-2.5-7B在40%噪声下仍能快速收敛，RPR方法达到70%以上准确率，接近无噪声训练。

Conclusion: 研究表明推理过程比结果更重要，RPR可校准噪声奖励模型，为后训练技术提供新思路。

Abstract: Recent studies on post-training large language models (LLMs) for reasoning
through reinforcement learning (RL) typically focus on tasks that can be
accurately verified and rewarded, such as solving math problems. In contrast,
our research investigates the impact of reward noise, a more practical
consideration for real-world scenarios involving the post-training of LLMs
using reward models. We found that LLMs demonstrate strong robustness to
substantial reward noise. For example, manually flipping 40% of the reward
function's outputs in math tasks still allows a Qwen-2.5-7B model to achieve
rapid convergence, improving its performance on math tasks from 5% to 72%,
compared to the 75% accuracy achieved by a model trained with noiseless
rewards. Surprisingly, by only rewarding the appearance of key reasoning
phrases (namely reasoning pattern reward, RPR), such as ``first, I need
to''-without verifying the correctness of answers, the model achieved peak
downstream performance (over 70% accuracy for Qwen-2.5-7B) comparable to models
trained with strict correctness verification and accurate rewards. Recognizing
the importance of the reasoning process over the final results, we combined RPR
with noisy reward models. RPR helped calibrate the noisy reward models,
mitigating potential false negatives and enhancing the LLM's performance on
open-ended tasks. These findings suggest the importance of improving models'
foundational abilities during the pre-training phase while providing insights
for advancing post-training techniques. Our code and scripts are available at

Motivation: 传统静态基准测试缺乏对不同应用领域的适应性，且无法精细评估领域知识和上下文推理能力。

Method: GuessArena采用类似“猜猜我是谁”游戏的交互结构，结合动态领域知识建模和渐进式推理评估。

Result: 在五个垂直领域（金融、医疗、制造、信息技术和教育）的实证研究表明，GuessArena能有效区分大语言模型的领域知识覆盖和推理链完整性。

Conclusion: GuessArena在可解释性、可扩展性和场景适应性方面优于传统基准测试。

Abstract: The evaluation of large language models (LLMs) has traditionally relied on
static benchmarks, a paradigm that poses two major limitations: (1) predefined
test sets lack adaptability to diverse application domains, and (2)
standardized evaluation protocols often fail to capture fine-grained
assessments of domain-specific knowledge and contextual reasoning abilities. To
overcome these challenges, we propose GuessArena, an adaptive evaluation
framework grounded in adversarial game-based interactions. Inspired by the
interactive structure of the Guess Who I Am? game, our framework seamlessly
integrates dynamic domain knowledge modeling with progressive reasoning
assessment to improve evaluation fidelity. Empirical studies across five
vertical domains-finance, healthcare, manufacturing, information technology,
and education-demonstrate that GuessArena effectively distinguishes LLMs in
terms of domain knowledge coverage and reasoning chain completeness. Compared
to conventional benchmarks, our method provides substantial advantages in
interpretability, scalability, and scenario adaptability.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在简单推理问题上生成过长推理路径的问题，降低推理成本和延迟。

Method: 提出AutoL2S框架，通过标注数据训练LLMs动态选择长或短推理路径，使用<EASY>标记简化推理。

Result: 推理路径长度减少57%，性能不受影响。

Conclusion: AutoL2S有效提升LLMs推理的效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: The reasoning-capable large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong
performance on complex reasoning tasks but often suffer from overthinking,
generating unnecessarily long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paths for easy
reasoning questions, thereby increasing inference cost and latency. Recent
approaches attempt to address this challenge by manually deciding when to apply
long or short reasoning. However, they lack the flexibility to adapt CoT length
dynamically based on question complexity. In this paper, we propose Auto
Long-Short Reasoning (AutoL2S), a dynamic and model-agnostic framework that
enables LLMs to dynamically compress their generated reasoning path based on
the complexity of the reasoning question. AutoL2S enables a learned paradigm,
in which LLMs themselves can decide when longer reasoning is necessary and when
shorter reasoning suffices, by training on data annotated with our proposed
method, which includes both long and short CoT paths and a special <EASY>
token. We then use <EASY> token to indicate when the model can skip generating
lengthy CoT reasoning. This proposed annotation strategy can enhance the LLMs'
ability to generate shorter CoT reasoning paths with improved quality after
training. Extensive evaluation results show that AutoL2S reduces the length of
reasoning generation by up to 57% without compromising performance,
demonstrating the effectiveness of AutoL2S for scalable and efficient LLM
reasoning.

Result: 实验表明，ViTA显著提升Grad-CAM和Grad-CAM++生成的解释与人类感知的一致性。

Conclusion: ViTA为提升模型解释性提供了有效且无需训练的新途径。

Abstract: Machine learning models achieve high precision, but their decision-making
processes often lack explainability. Furthermore, as model complexity
increases, explainability typically decreases. Existing efforts to improve
explainability primarily involve developing new eXplainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) techniques or incorporating explainability constraints
during training. While these approaches yield specific improvements, their
applicability remains limited. In this work, we propose the Vision Transformer
with artificial Astrocytes (ViTA). This training-free approach is inspired by
neuroscience and enhances the reasoning of a pretrained deep neural network to
generate more human-aligned explanations. We evaluated our approach employing
two well-known XAI techniques, Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++, and compared it to a
standard Vision Transformer (ViT). Using the ClickMe dataset, we quantified the
similarity between the heatmaps produced by the XAI techniques and a
(human-aligned) ground truth. Our results consistently demonstrate that
incorporating artificial astrocytes enhances the alignment of model
explanations with human perception, leading to statistically significant
improvements across all XAI techniques and metrics utilized.

Abstract: Recent advancements in DeepFake generation, along with the proliferation of
open-source tools, have significantly lowered the barrier for creating
synthetic media. This trend poses a serious threat to the integrity and
authenticity of online information, undermining public trust in institutions
and media. State-of-the-art research on DeepFake detection has primarily
focused on binary detection models. A key limitation of these models is that
they treat all manipulation techniques as equivalent, despite the fact that
different methods introduce distinct artifacts and visual cues. Only a limited
number of studies explore DeepFake attribution models, although such models are
crucial in practical settings. By providing the specific manipulation method
employed, these models could enhance both the perceived trustworthiness and
explainability for end users. In this work, we leverage five state-of-the-art
backbone models and conduct extensive experiments across six DeepFake datasets.
First, we compare binary and multi-class models in terms of cross-dataset
generalization. Second, we examine the accuracy of attribution models in
detecting seen manipulation methods in unknown datasets, hence uncovering data
distribution shifts on the same DeepFake manipulations. Last, we assess the
effectiveness of contrastive methods in improving cross-dataset generalization
performance. Our findings indicate that while binary models demonstrate better
generalization abilities, larger models, contrastive methods, and higher data
quality can lead to performance improvements in attribution models. The code of
this work is available on GitHub.

*Shan Gao,Zhiqiang Wu,Yawen Niu,Xiaotao Li,Qingqing Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种硬件-算法协同设计框架CIM-NET，通过优化架构和引入伪卷积算子，显著减少矩阵-向量乘法操作，提升边缘设备上的视频去噪效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DNN模型未考虑计算内存（CIM）架构限制，限制了其在边缘设备上的加速潜力。

Method: 提出CIM-NET架构和伪卷积算子CIM-CONV，结合滑动处理与全连接变换，优化大感受野操作。

Result: CIM-NET将MVM操作减少至1/77，同时保持接近FastDVDnet的去噪性能（PSNR 35.11 dB vs. 35.56 dB）。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了CIM芯片上的推理速度，为边缘设备的高效视频去噪提供了可行方案。

Abstract: While deep neural network (DNN)-based video denoising has demonstrated
significant performance, deploying state-of-the-art models on edge devices
remains challenging due to stringent real-time and energy efficiency
requirements. Computing-in-Memory (CIM) chips offer a promising solution by
integrating computation within memory cells, enabling rapid matrix-vector
multiplication (MVM). However, existing DNN models are often designed without
considering CIM architectural constraints, thus limiting their acceleration
potential during inference. To address this, we propose a hardware-algorithm
co-design framework incorporating two innovations: (1) a CIM-Aware
Architecture, CIM-NET, optimized for large receptive field operation and CIM's
crossbar-based MVM acceleration; and (2) a pseudo-convolutional operator,
CIM-CONV, used within CIM-NET to integrate slide-based processing with fully
connected transformations for high-quality feature extraction and
reconstruction. This framework significantly reduces the number of MVM
operations, improving inference speed on CIM chips while maintaining
competitive performance. Experimental results indicate that, compared to the
conventional lightweight model FastDVDnet, CIM-NET substantially reduces MVM
operations with a slight decrease in denoising performance. With a stride value
of 8, CIM-NET reduces MVM operations to 1/77th of the original, while
maintaining competitive PSNR (35.11 dB vs. 35.56 dB

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种从非配对数据中学习共享表示的方法，通过随机游走矩阵的谱嵌入实现，展示了在跨模态任务中的高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态表示学习方法依赖配对样本，但配对数据难以获取，因此研究如何从非配对数据中学习共享表示。

Method: 利用随机游走矩阵的谱嵌入，独立构建单模态表示，从而学习共享表示。

Result: 在计算机视觉和自然语言处理任务中表现优异，支持检索、生成、算术、零样本和跨域分类。

Conclusion: 首次证明从非配对数据中学习通用跨模态嵌入的可行性，为多模态学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Learning shared representations is a primary area of multimodal
representation learning. The current approaches to achieve a shared embedding
space rely heavily on paired samples from each modality, which are
significantly harder to obtain than unpaired ones. In this work, we demonstrate
that shared representations can be learned almost exclusively from unpaired
data. Our arguments are grounded in the spectral embeddings of the random walk
matrices constructed independently from each unimodal representation. Empirical
results in computer vision and natural language processing domains support its
potential, revealing the effectiveness of unpaired data in capturing meaningful
cross-modal relations, demonstrating high capabilities in retrieval tasks,
generation, arithmetics, zero-shot, and cross-domain classification. This work,
to the best of our knowledge, is the first to demonstrate these capabilities
almost exclusively from unpaired samples, giving rise to a cross-modal
embedding that could be viewed as universal, i.e., independent of the specific
modalities of the data. Our code IS publicly available at

TL;DR: UniDB++是一种无需训练的采样算法，显著提升了UniDB框架的计算效率和生成质量，通过闭式解和SDE-Corrector机制实现快速高质量图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UniDB框架在图像生成中依赖迭代采样方法，导致计算效率低下，现有加速技术无法解决其独特挑战。

Method: 提出UniDB++，通过闭式解减少误差积累，采用数据预测模型和SDE-Corrector机制提升稳定性。

Result: UniDB++在图像修复任务中表现优异，生成速度提升20倍，同时保持高保真度。

Conclusion: UniDB++在理论和实践中弥合了SOC驱动的扩散桥模型的效率差距。

Abstract: Diffusion Bridges enable transitions between arbitrary distributions, with
the Unified Diffusion Bridge (UniDB) framework achieving high-fidelity image
generation via a Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC) formulation. However, UniDB's
reliance on iterative Euler sampling methods results in slow, computationally
expensive inference, while existing acceleration techniques for diffusion or
diffusion bridge models fail to address its unique challenges: missing terminal
mean constraints and SOC-specific penalty coefficients in its SDEs. We present
UniDB++, a training-free sampling algorithm that significantly improves upon
these limitations. The method's key advancement comes from deriving exact
closed-form solutions for UniDB's reverse-time SDEs, effectively reducing the
error accumulation inherent in Euler approximations and enabling high-quality
generation with up to 20$\times$ fewer sampling steps. This method is further
complemented by replacing conventional noise prediction with a more stable data
prediction model, along with an SDE-Corrector mechanism that maintains
perceptual quality for low-step regimes (5-10 steps). Additionally, we
demonstrate that UniDB++ aligns with existing diffusion bridge acceleration
methods by evaluating their update rules, and UniDB++ can recover DBIMs as
special cases under some theoretical conditions. Experiments demonstrate
UniDB++'s state-of-the-art performance in image restoration tasks,
outperforming Euler-based methods in fidelity and speed while reducing
inference time significantly. This work bridges the gap between theoretical
generality and practical efficiency in SOC-driven diffusion bridge models. Our
code is available at https://github.com/2769433owo/UniDB-plusplus.

TL;DR: LLMs在3D虚拟角色控制中表现良好，能生成高级运动计划，但在精确身体部位定位和多步高自由度动作上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在人类运动知识中的应用，验证其能否通过文本指令生成详细的运动计划和动画。

Method: 通过高级规划和低级规划两步法生成运动计划，并转化为动画供人类评估。

Result: LLMs擅长高级运动解释，但精确定位和多步动作表现较差，但在创意和文化特定动作上有潜力。

Conclusion: LLMs在运动规划中有潜力，但需改进精确空间定位和多步动作处理能力。

Abstract: We explore Large Language Models (LLMs)' human motion knowledge through 3D
avatar control. Given a motion instruction, we prompt LLMs to first generate a
high-level movement plan with consecutive steps (High-level Planning), then
specify body part positions in each step (Low-level Planning), which we
linearly interpolate into avatar animations as a clear verification lens for
human evaluators. Through carefully designed 20 representative motion
instructions with full coverage of basic movement primitives and balanced body
part usage, we conduct comprehensive evaluations including human assessment of
both generated animations and high-level movement plans, as well as automatic
comparison with oracle positions in low-level planning. We find that LLMs are
strong at interpreting the high-level body movements but struggle with precise
body part positioning. While breaking down motion queries into atomic
components improves planning performance, LLMs have difficulty with multi-step
movements involving high-degree-of-freedom body parts. Furthermore, LLMs
provide reasonable approximation for general spatial descriptions, but fail to
handle precise spatial specifications in text, and the precise spatial-temporal
parameters needed for avatar control. Notably, LLMs show promise in
conceptualizing creative motions and distinguishing culturally-specific motion
patterns.

Motivation: 荧光LiDAR在散射介质中面临信号复杂、难以分离光子飞行时间和荧光寿命的问题，限制了现有方法的有效性。

Method: 采用物理引导的MoE框架，结合基于证据的Dirichlet批评器（EDCs）和决策网络，动态融合专家预测。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了荧光LiDAR在复杂环境中的性能，为医学等领域提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Fluorescence LiDAR (FLiDAR), a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology
employed for distance and depth estimation across medical, automotive, and
other fields, encounters significant computational challenges in scattering
media. The complex nature of the acquired FLiDAR signal, particularly in such
environments, makes isolating photon time-of-flight (related to target depth)
and intrinsic fluorescence lifetime exceptionally difficult, thus limiting the
effectiveness of current analytical and computational methodologies. To
overcome this limitation, we present a Physics-Guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
framework tailored for specialized modeling of diverse temporal components. In
contrast to the conventional MoE approaches our expert models are informed by
underlying physics, such as the radiative transport equation governing photon
propagation in scattering media. Central to our approach is EvidenceMoE, which
integrates Evidence-Based Dirichlet Critics (EDCs). These critic models assess
the reliability of each expert's output by providing per-expert quality scores
and corrective feedback. A Decider Network then leverages this information to
fuse expert predictions into a robust final estimate adaptively. We validate
our method using realistically simulated Fluorescence LiDAR (FLiDAR) data for
non-invasive cancer cell depth detection generated from photon transport models
in tissue. Our framework demonstrates strong performance, achieving a
normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) of 0.030 for depth estimation and
0.074 for fluorescence lifetime.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有原型自监督学习方法仅依赖单一原型编码隐藏簇的特征，限制了性能。SOP通过多支持嵌入更好地表征数据区域。

Method: 提出SOP策略，使用多个支持嵌入表征原型，并引入非参数损失函数和SOP-MIM任务。

Result: 在检索、线性评估、微调和目标检测等任务中表现优异，预训练编码器在多个检索基准上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: SOP策略显著提升了无监督视觉特征学习的性能，尤其适用于复杂编码器。

Abstract: We present Self-Organizing Visual Prototypes (SOP), a new training technique
for unsupervised visual feature learning. Unlike existing prototypical
self-supervised learning (SSL) methods that rely on a single prototype to
encode all relevant features of a hidden cluster in the data, we propose the
SOP strategy. In this strategy, a prototype is represented by many semantically
similar representations, or support embeddings (SEs), each containing a
complementary set of features that together better characterize their region in
space and maximize training performance. We reaffirm the feasibility of
non-parametric SSL by introducing novel non-parametric adaptations of two loss
functions that implement the SOP strategy. Notably, we introduce the SOP Masked
Image Modeling (SOP-MIM) task, where masked representations are reconstructed
from the perspective of multiple non-parametric local SEs. We comprehensively
evaluate the representations learned using the SOP strategy on a range of
benchmarks, including retrieval, linear evaluation, fine-tuning, and object
detection. Our pre-trained encoders achieve state-of-the-art performance on
many retrieval benchmarks and demonstrate increasing performance gains with
more complex encoders.

TL;DR: FAR框架通过用LSTM等序列到序列模块替换预训练Transformer中的注意力机制，提升了推理效率，同时保持了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的注意力机制在推理时效率低，尤其是在资源有限的边缘设备上。研究发现推理时的注意力冗余，认为可以用更简单的函数替代。

Method: 提出FAR框架，用LSTM替换注意力模块，通过块级蒸馏和全局结构剪枝优化，生成高效的LSTM模型。

Result: 在DeiT视觉Transformer上验证，FAR在ImageNet和下游任务中保持原模型精度，同时减少参数和延迟。

Conclusion: FAR成功保留了注意力模块的语义关系，证明了用低成本函数替代注意力的可行性。

Abstract: While transformers excel across vision and language pretraining tasks, their
reliance on attention mechanisms poses challenges for inference efficiency,
especially on edge and embedded accelerators with limited parallelism and
memory bandwidth. Hinted by the observed redundancy of attention at inference
time, we hypothesize that though the model learns complicated token dependency
through pretraining, the inference-time sequence-to-sequence mapping in each
attention layer is actually ''simple'' enough to be represented with a much
cheaper function. In this work, we explore FAR, a Function-preserving Attention
Replacement framework that replaces all attention blocks in pretrained
transformers with learnable sequence-to-sequence modules, exemplified by an
LSTM. FAR optimize a multi-head LSTM architecture with a block-wise
distillation objective and a global structural pruning framework to achieve a
family of efficient LSTM-based models from pretrained transformers. We validate
FAR on the DeiT vision transformer family and demonstrate that it matches the
accuracy of the original models on ImageNet and multiple downstream tasks with
reduced parameters and latency. Further analysis shows that FAR preserves the
semantic token relationships and the token-to-token correlation learned in the
transformer's attention module.

Result: 发现VLMs在空间理解和选择性注意力任务中存在显著差距，但通过生成文本推理和针对性微调可改善性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLMs的认知局限性，并提出了改进其推理能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in visual
understanding in recent years. Yet, they still lag behind human capabilities in
specific visual tasks such as counting or relational reasoning. To understand
the underlying limitations, we adopt methodologies from cognitive science,
analyzing VLM performance along core cognitive axes: Perception, Attention, and
Memory. Using a suite of tasks targeting these abilities, we evaluate
state-of-the-art VLMs, including GPT-4o. Our analysis reveals distinct
cognitive profiles: while advanced models approach ceiling performance on some
tasks (e.g. category identification), a significant gap persists, particularly
in tasks requiring spatial understanding or selective attention. Investigating
the source of these failures and potential methods for improvement, we employ a
vision-text decoupling analysis, finding that models struggling with direct
visual reasoning show marked improvement when reasoning over their own
generated text captions. These experiments reveal a strong need for improved
VLM Chain-of-Thought (CoT) abilities, even in models that consistently exceed
human performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of targeted
fine-tuning on composite visual reasoning tasks and show that fine-tuning
smaller VLMs substantially improves core cognitive abilities. While this
improvement does not translate to large enhancements on challenging,
out-of-distribution benchmarks, we show broadly that VLM performance on our
datasets strongly correlates with performance on these other benchmarks. Our
work provides a detailed analysis of VLM cognitive strengths and weaknesses and
identifies key bottlenecks in simultaneous perception and reasoning while also
providing an effective and simple solution.

Abstract: The goal of point cloud assembly is to reconstruct a complete 3D shape by
aligning multiple point cloud pieces. This work presents a novel equivariant
solver for assembly tasks based on flow matching models. We first theoretically
show that the key to learning equivariant distributions via flow matching is to
learn related vector fields. Based on this result, we propose an assembly
model, called equivariant diffusion assembly (Eda), which learns related vector
fields conditioned on the input pieces. We further construct an equivariant
path for Eda, which guarantees high data efficiency of the training process.
Our numerical results show that Eda is highly competitive on practical
datasets, and it can even handle the challenging situation where the input
pieces are non-overlapped.

Conclusion: DiffDecompose和AlphaBlend为透明层分解任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently motivated great success in many generation
tasks like object removal. Nevertheless, existing image decomposition methods
struggle to disentangle semi-transparent or transparent layer occlusions due to
mask prior dependencies, static object assumptions, and the lack of datasets.
In this paper, we delve into a novel task: Layer-Wise Decomposition of
Alpha-Composited Images, aiming to recover constituent layers from single
overlapped images under the condition of semi-transparent/transparent alpha
layer non-linear occlusion. To address challenges in layer ambiguity,
generalization, and data scarcity, we first introduce AlphaBlend, the first
large-scale and high-quality dataset for transparent and semi-transparent layer
decomposition, supporting six real-world subtasks (e.g., translucent flare
removal, semi-transparent cell decomposition, glassware decomposition).
Building on this dataset, we present DiffDecompose, a diffusion
Transformer-based framework that learns the posterior over possible layer
decompositions conditioned on the input image, semantic prompts, and blending
type. Rather than regressing alpha mattes directly, DiffDecompose performs
In-Context Decomposition, enabling the model to predict one or multiple layers
without per-layer supervision, and introduces Layer Position Encoding Cloning
to maintain pixel-level correspondence across layers. Extensive experiments on
the proposed AlphaBlend dataset and public LOGO dataset verify the
effectiveness of DiffDecompose. The code and dataset will be available upon
paper acceptance. Our code will be available at:

Conclusion: 该框架具有可扩展性和用户友好性，未来可广泛应用于农业领域。

Abstract: As a social being, we have an intimate bond with the environment. A plethora
of things in human life, such as lifestyle, health, and food are dependent on
the environment and agriculture. It comes under our responsibility to support
the environment as well as agriculture. However, traditional farming practices
often result in inefficient resource use and environmental challenges. To
address these issues, precision agriculture has emerged as a promising approach
that leverages advanced technologies to optimise agricultural processes. In
this work, a hybrid approach is proposed that combines the three different
potential fields of model AI: object detection, large language model (LLM), and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). In this novel framework, we have tried to
combine the vision and language models to work together to identify potential
diseases in the tree leaf. This study introduces a novel AI-based precision
agriculture system that uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide
context-aware diagnoses and natural language processing (NLP) and YOLOv8 for
crop disease detection. The system aims to tackle major issues with large
language models (LLMs), especially hallucinations and allows for adaptive
treatment plans and real-time disease detection. The system provides an
easy-to-use interface to the farmers, which they can use to detect the
different diseases related to coffee leaves by just submitting the image of the
affected leaf the model will detect the diseases as well as suggest potential
remediation methodologies which aim to lower the use of pesticides, preserving
livelihoods, and encouraging environmentally friendly methods. With an emphasis
on scalability, dependability, and user-friendliness, the project intends to
improve RAG-integrated object detection systems for wider agricultural
applications in the future.

Motivation: 现有LVDMs对不完美条件敏感，导致语义漂移和时间不一致性，尤其在噪声多的网络视频文本数据上。

Method: 提出CAT-LVDM框架，包含Batch-Centered Noise Injection (BCNI)和Spectrum-Aware Contextual Noise (SACN)，分别针对语义一致性和低频平滑性。

Result: BCNI在WebVid-2M等数据集上平均减少FVD 31.9%，SACN在UCF-101上提升12.3%。

Conclusion: CAT-LVDM为多模态噪声下的鲁棒视频扩散训练提供了可扩展的理论与实践方案。

Abstract: Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) achieve high-quality generation but are
sensitive to imperfect conditioning, which causes semantic drift and temporal
incoherence on noisy, web-scale video-text datasets. We introduce CAT-LVDM, the
first corruption-aware training framework for LVDMs that improves robustness
through structured, data-aligned noise injection. Our method includes
Batch-Centered Noise Injection (BCNI), which perturbs embeddings along
intra-batch semantic directions to preserve temporal consistency. BCNI is
especially effective on caption-rich datasets like WebVid-2M, MSR-VTT, and
MSVD. We also propose Spectrum-Aware Contextual Noise (SACN), which injects
noise along dominant spectral directions to improve low-frequency smoothness,
showing strong results on UCF-101. On average, BCNI reduces FVD by 31.9% across
WebVid-2M, MSR-VTT, and MSVD, while SACN yields a 12.3% improvement on UCF-101.
Ablation studies confirm the benefit of low-rank, data-aligned noise. Our
theoretical analysis further explains how such perturbations tighten entropy,
Wasserstein, score-drift, mixing-time, and generalization bounds. CAT-LVDM
establishes a principled, scalable training approach for robust video diffusion
under multimodal noise. Code and models: https://github.com/chikap421/catlvdm

Result: 幻觉主要与输入中主导的标记簇相关，提出的方法有效减少了幻觉。

Conclusion: 通过修改潜在图像嵌入，成功缓解幻觉问题，同时保持模型表达能力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with discrete image tokenizers unify
multimodal representations by encoding visual inputs into a finite set of
tokens. Despite their effectiveness, we find that these models still
hallucinate non-existent objects. We hypothesize that this may be due to visual
priors induced during training: When certain image tokens frequently co-occur
in the same spatial regions and represent shared objects, they become strongly
associated with the verbalizations of those objects. As a result, the model may
hallucinate by evoking visually absent tokens that often co-occur with present
ones. To test this assumption, we construct a co-occurrence graph of image
tokens using a segmentation dataset and employ a Graph Neural Network (GNN)
with contrastive learning followed by a clustering method to group tokens that
frequently co-occur in similar visual contexts. We find that hallucinations
predominantly correspond to clusters whose tokens dominate the input, and more
specifically, that the visually absent tokens in those clusters show much
higher correlation with hallucinated objects compared to tokens present in the
image. Based on this observation, we propose a hallucination mitigation method
that suppresses the influence of visually absent tokens by modifying latent
image embeddings during generation. Experiments show our method reduces
hallucinations while preserving expressivity. Code is available at

Motivation: 解决CLIP模型在检索任务中因固定分辨率和有限上下文导致的细粒度跨模态理解不足问题。

Method: 采用跨模态Transformer教师模型生成增强嵌入，指导轻量学生模型训练，结合对比学习和余弦相似性损失。

Result: 在少量数据上训练后，DCLIP显著提升检索指标（Recall@K, MAP），并保留94%的零样本分类性能。

Conclusion: DCLIP有效平衡任务专业化和泛化能力，为视觉-语言任务提供高效、自适应且细节敏感的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Distill CLIP (DCLIP), a fine-tuned variant of the CLIP model that
enhances multimodal image-text retrieval while preserving the original model's
strong zero-shot classification capabilities. CLIP models are typically
constrained by fixed image resolutions and limited context, which can hinder
their effectiveness in retrieval tasks that require fine-grained cross-modal
understanding. DCLIP addresses these challenges through a meta teacher-student
distillation framework, where a cross-modal transformer teacher is fine-tuned
to produce enriched embeddings via bidirectional cross-attention between
YOLO-extracted image regions and corresponding textual spans. These
semantically and spatially aligned global representations guide the training of
a lightweight student model using a hybrid loss that combines contrastive
learning and cosine similarity objectives. Despite being trained on only
~67,500 samples curated from MSCOCO, Flickr30k, and Conceptual Captions-just a
fraction of CLIP's original dataset-DCLIP significantly improves image-text
retrieval metrics (Recall@K, MAP), while retaining approximately 94% of CLIP's
zero-shot classification performance. These results demonstrate that DCLIP
effectively mitigates the trade-off between task specialization and
generalization, offering a resource-efficient, domain-adaptive, and
detail-sensitive solution for advanced vision-language tasks. Code available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Toxic-Continuation范式在缺乏显式毒性信号时效果不佳，需探索更有效的攻击方式。

Method: 优化对抗图像，使其在良性输入条件下诱导模型生成毒性输出。

Result: B2T方法优于现有方法，支持黑盒迁移，并能与文本攻击互补。

Conclusion: 揭示了多模态对齐的新漏洞，为攻击方法提供了新方向。

Abstract: Optimization-based jailbreaks typically adopt the Toxic-Continuation setting
in large vision-language models (LVLMs), following the standard next-token
prediction objective. In this setting, an adversarial image is optimized to
make the model predict the next token of a toxic prompt. However, we find that
the Toxic-Continuation paradigm is effective at continuing already-toxic
inputs, but struggles to induce safety misalignment when explicit toxic signals
are absent. We propose a new paradigm: Benign-to-Toxic (B2T) jailbreak. Unlike
prior work, we optimize adversarial images to induce toxic outputs from benign
conditioning. Since benign conditioning contains no safety violations, the
image alone must break the model's safety mechanisms. Our method outperforms
prior approaches, transfers in black-box settings, and complements text-based
jailbreaks. These results reveal an underexplored vulnerability in multimodal
alignment and introduce a fundamentally new direction for jailbreak approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents an algorithm for analytically calculating the weights and
thresholds of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) without using standard
training procedures. The algorithm enables the determination of CNN parameters
based on just 10 selected images from the MNIST dataset, each representing a
digit from 0 to 9. As part of the method, the number of channels in CNN layers
is also derived analytically. A software module was implemented in C++ Builder,
and a series of experiments were conducted using the MNIST dataset. Results
demonstrate that the analytically computed CNN can recognize over half of 1000
handwritten digit images without any training, achieving inference in fractions
of a second. These findings suggest that CNNs can be constructed and applied
directly for classification tasks without training, using purely analytical
computation of weights.

Abstract: Agricultural research has accelerated in recent years, yet farmers often lack
the time and resources for on-farm research due to the demands of crop
production and farm operations. Seed classification offers valuable insights
into quality control, production efficiency, and impurity detection. Early
identification of seed types is critical to reducing the cost and risk
associated with field emergence, which can lead to yield losses or disruptions
in downstream processes like harvesting. Seed sampling supports growers in
monitoring and managing seed quality, improving precision in determining seed
purity levels, guiding management adjustments, and enhancing yield estimations.
This study proposes a novel convolutional neural network (CNN)-based framework
for the efficient classification of ten common Brassica seed types. The
approach addresses the inherent challenge of texture similarity in seed images
using a custom-designed CNN architecture. The model's performance was evaluated
against several pre-trained state-of-the-art architectures, with adjustments to
layer configurations for optimized classification. Experimental results using
our collected Brassica seed dataset demonstrate that the proposed model
achieved a high accuracy rate of 93 percent.

Conclusion: 该方法简化了预处理步骤，加速了部署，适用于多样化的临床环境。

Abstract: We introduce a novel deep learning framework for the automated staging of
spheno-occipital synchondrosis (SOS) fusion, a critical diagnostic marker in
both orthodontics and forensic anthropology. Our approach leverages a
dual-model architecture wherein a teacher model, trained on manually cropped
images, transfers its precise spatial understanding to a student model that
operates on full, uncropped images. This knowledge distillation is facilitated
by a newly formulated loss function that aligns spatial logits as well as
incorporates gradient-based attention spatial mapping, ensuring that the
student model internalizes the anatomically relevant features without relying
on external cropping or YOLO-based segmentation. By leveraging expert-curated
data and feedback at each step, our framework attains robust diagnostic
accuracy, culminating in a clinically viable end-to-end pipeline. This
streamlined approach obviates the need for additional pre-processing tools and
accelerates deployment, thereby enhancing both the efficiency and consistency
of skeletal maturation assessment in diverse clinical settings.

Motivation: 在脑血肿CT的多示例学习中，当每个包中的实例数量增加到256时，学习变得极其困难。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用自监督学习的预训练模型作为多示例学习器的下游任务，以克服原始任务中的虚假相关性。

Result: 在脑血肿CT的低密度标记分类中，准确率提高了5%至13%，F1分数提高了40%至55%。

Conclusion: 通过自监督预训练模型，可以有效解决多示例学习中实例数量增加带来的挑战，显著提升分类性能。

Abstract: In deep multi-instance learning, the number of applicable instances depends
on the data set. In histopathology images, deep learning multi-instance
learners usually assume there are hundreds to thousands instances in a bag.
However, when the number of instances in a bag increases to 256 in brain
hematoma CT, learning becomes extremely difficult. In this paper, we address
this drawback. To overcome this problem, we propose using a pre-trained model
with self-supervised learning for the multi-instance learner as a downstream
task. With this method, even when the original target task suffers from the
spurious correlation problem, we show improvements of 5% to 13% in accuracy and
40% to 55% in the F1 measure for the hypodensity marker classification of brain
hematoma CT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI运动捕捉技术依赖预定义视频序列，无法处理未观察到的动作。本文旨在应用于虚拟人类，需要更灵活的动作生成。

Method: 提出基于扩散模型的动作补全技术，结合门模块和位置-时间嵌入模块，生成互补动作序列。

Result: 在Human3.6M数据集上，MDC-Net在ADE、FDE和MMADE上优于现有方法，模型更小（16.84M），生成的动作更自然。

Conclusion: MDC-Net在动作补全和生成上表现优异，为虚拟人类运动捕捉提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: AI-based motion capture is an emerging technology that offers a
cost-effective alternative to traditional motion capture systems. However,
current AI motion capture methods rely entirely on observed video sequences,
similar to conventional motion capture. This means that all human actions must
be predefined, and movements outside the observed sequences are not possible.
To address this limitation, we aim to apply AI motion capture to virtual
humans, where flexible actions beyond the observed sequences are required. We
assume that while many action fragments exist in the training data, the
transitions between them may be missing. To bridge these gaps, we propose a
diffusion-model-based action completion technique that generates complementary
human motion sequences, ensuring smooth and continuous movements. By
introducing a gate module and a position-time embedding module, our approach
achieves competitive results on the Human3.6M dataset. Our experimental results
show that (1) MDC-Net outperforms existing methods in ADE, FDE, and MMADE but
is slightly less accurate in MMFDE, (2) MDC-Net has a smaller model size
(16.84M) compared to HumanMAC (28.40M), and (3) MDC-Net generates more natural
and coherent motion sequences. Additionally, we propose a method for extracting
sensor data, including acceleration and angular velocity, from human motion
sequences.

Result: EaqVLA在端到端动作控制中量化损失最小，并实现了显著的计算加速。

Conclusion: EaqVLA有效解决了VLA模型的量化问题，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: With the development of Embodied Artificial intelligence, the end-to-end
control policy such as Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model has become the
mainstream. Existing VLA models faces expensive computing/storage cost, which
need to be optimized. Quantization is considered as the most effective method
which can not only reduce the memory cost but also achieve computation
acceleration. However, we find the token alignment of VLA models hinders the
application of existing quantization methods. To address this, we proposed an
optimized framework called EaqVLA, which apply encoding-aligned quantization to
VLA models. Specifically, we propose an complete analysis method to find the
misalignment in various granularity. Based on the analysis results, we propose
a mixed precision quantization with the awareness of encoding alignment.
Experiments shows that the porposed EaqVLA achieves better quantization
performance (with the minimal quantization loss for end-to-end action control
and xxx times acceleration) than existing quantization methods.

Result: 在工业数据集上验证，T-EMNN能准确预测节点级3D变形，有效捕捉厚度效应且计算高效。

Conclusion: T-EMNN在保持计算效率的同时，显著提升了3D变形预测的准确性，解决了厚度忽略的问题。

Abstract: Mesh-based 3D static analysis methods have recently emerged as efficient
alternatives to traditional computational numerical solvers, significantly
reducing computational costs and runtime for various physics-based analyses.
However, these methods primarily focus on surface topology and geometry, often
overlooking the inherent thickness of real-world 3D objects, which exhibits
high correlations and similar behavior between opposing surfaces. This
limitation arises from the disconnected nature of these surfaces and the
absence of internal edge connections within the mesh. In this work, we propose
a novel framework, the Thickness-aware E(3)-Equivariant 3D Mesh Neural Network
(T-EMNN), that effectively integrates the thickness of 3D objects while
maintaining the computational efficiency of surface meshes. Additionally, we
introduce data-driven coordinates that encode spatial information while
preserving E(3)-equivariance or invariance properties, ensuring consistent and
robust analysis. Evaluations on a real-world industrial dataset demonstrate the
superior performance of T-EMNN in accurately predicting node-level 3D
deformations, effectively capturing thickness effects while maintaining
computational efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型增强方法难以保证生成多样性且需大幅增加数据量（10-30倍），本文旨在通过部分数据增强提升性能。

Method: 分析双层CNN，证明仅增强30%-40%未早期学习数据可促进特征学习速度的均匀性，避免噪声放大。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和TinyImageNet上，性能提升达2.8%，且SGD应用下优于SOTA优化器SAM。

Conclusion: 部分数据增强策略高效且兼容现有强弱增强方法，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Synthetically augmenting training datasets with diffusion models has been an
effective strategy for improving generalization of image classifiers. However,
existing techniques struggle to ensure the diversity of generation and increase
the size of the data by up to 10-30x to improve the in-distribution
performance. In this work, we show that synthetically augmenting part of the
data that is not learned early in training outperforms augmenting the entire
dataset. By analyzing a two-layer CNN, we prove that this strategy improves
generalization by promoting homogeneity in feature learning speed without
amplifying noise. Our extensive experiments show that by augmenting only
30%-40% of the data, our method boosts the performance by up to 2.8% in a
variety of scenarios, including training ResNet, ViT and DenseNet on CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, with a range of optimizers including SGD and SAM.
Notably, our method applied with SGD outperforms the SOTA optimizer, SAM, on
CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet. It can also easily stack with existing weak and
strong augmentation strategies to further boost the performance.

Abstract: From uncertainty quantification to real-world object detection, we recognize
the importance of machine learning algorithms, particularly in safety-critical
domains such as autonomous driving or medical diagnostics. In machine learning,
ambiguous data plays an important role in various machine learning domains.
Optical illusions present a compelling area of study in this context, as they
offer insight into the limitations of both human and machine perception.
Despite this relevance, optical illusion datasets remain scarce. In this work,
we introduce a novel dataset of optical illusions featuring intermingled animal
pairs designed to evoke perceptual ambiguity. We identify generalizable visual
concepts, particularly gaze direction and eye cues, as subtle yet impactful
features that significantly influence model accuracy. By confronting models
with perceptual ambiguity, our findings underscore the importance of concepts
in visual learning and provide a foundation for studying bias and alignment
between human and machine vision. To make this dataset useful for general
purposes, we generate optical illusions systematically with different concepts
discussed in our bias mitigation section. The dataset is accessible in Kaggle
via

Conclusion: 该方法解决了视频散景的挑战，实现了时间一致性和深度感知的散景效果。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion based editing models have enabled realistic
camera simulation and image-based bokeh, but video bokeh remains largely
unexplored. Existing video editing models cannot explicitly control focus
planes or adjust bokeh intensity, limiting their applicability for controllable
optical effects. Moreover, naively extending image-based bokeh methods to video
often results in temporal flickering and unsatisfactory edge blur transitions
due to the lack of temporal modeling and generalization capability. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel one-step video bokeh framework that
converts arbitrary input videos into temporally coherent, depth-aware bokeh
effects. Our method leverages a multi-plane image (MPI) representation
constructed through a progressively widening depth sampling function, providing
explicit geometric guidance for depth-dependent blur synthesis. By conditioning
a single-step video diffusion model on MPI layers and utilizing the strong 3D
priors from pre-trained models such as Stable Video Diffusion, our approach
achieves realistic and consistent bokeh effects across diverse scenes.
Additionally, we introduce a progressive training strategy to enhance temporal
consistency, depth robustness, and detail preservation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method produces high-quality, controllable bokeh effects
and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple evaluation benchmarks.

Abstract: Object concepts play a foundational role in human visual cognition, enabling
perception, memory, and interaction in the physical world. Inspired by findings
in developmental neuroscience - where infants are shown to acquire object
understanding through observation of motion - we propose a biologically
inspired framework for learning object-centric visual representations in an
unsupervised manner. Our key insight is that motion boundary serves as a strong
signal for object-level grouping, which can be used to derive pseudo instance
supervision from raw videos. Concretely, we generate motion-based instance
masks using off-the-shelf optical flow and clustering algorithms, and use them
to train visual encoders via contrastive learning. Our framework is fully
label-free and does not rely on camera calibration, making it scalable to
large-scale unstructured video data. We evaluate our approach on three
downstream tasks spanning both low-level (monocular depth estimation) and
high-level (3D object detection and occupancy prediction) vision. Our models
outperform previous supervised and self-supervised baselines and demonstrate
strong generalization to unseen scenes. These results suggest that
motion-induced object representations offer a compelling alternative to
existing vision foundation models, capturing a crucial but overlooked level of
abstraction: the visual instance. The corresponding code will be released upon
paper acceptance.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances made in all-in-one image restoration (AIR) for
handling different types of degradations simultaneously, existing methods
remain vulnerable to out-of-distribution degradations and images, limiting
their real-world applicability. In this paper, we propose a multi-source
representation learning framework BaryIR, which decomposes the latent space of
multi-source degraded images into a continuous barycenter space for unified
feature encoding and source-specific subspaces for specific semantic encoding.
Specifically, we seek the multi-source unified representation by introducing a
multi-source latent optimal transport barycenter problem, in which a continuous
barycenter map is learned to transport the latent representations to the
barycenter space. The transport cost is designed such that the representations
from source-specific subspaces are contrasted with each other while maintaining
orthogonality to those from the barycenter space. This enables BaryIR to learn
compact representations with unified degradation-agnostic information from the
barycenter space, as well as degradation-specific semantics from
source-specific subspaces, capturing the inherent geometry of multi-source data
manifold for generalizable AIR. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BaryIR
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art all-in-one
methods. Particularly, BaryIR exhibits superior generalization ability to
real-world data and unseen degradations. The code will be publicly available at

Abstract: Advances in machine learning, especially the introduction of transformer
architectures and vision transformers, have led to the development of highly
capable computer vision foundation models. The segment anything model (known
colloquially as SAM and more recently SAM 2), is a highly capable foundation
model for segmentation of natural images and has been further applied to
medical and scientific image segmentation tasks. SAM relies on prompts --
points or regions of interest in an image -- to generate associated
segmentations.
  In this manuscript we propose the use of a geometrically motivated prompt
generator to produce prompt points that are colocated with particular features
of interest. Focused prompting enables the automatic generation of sensitive
and specific segmentations in a scientific image analysis task using SAM with
relatively few point prompts. The image analysis task examined is the
segmentation of plant roots in rhizotron or minirhizotron images, which has
historically been a difficult task to automate. Hand annotation of rhizotron
images is laborious and often subjective; SAM, initialized with GeomPrompt
local ridge prompts has the potential to dramatically improve rhizotron image
processing.
  The authors have concurrently released an open source software suite called
geomprompt https://pypi.org/project/geomprompt/ that can produce point prompts
in a format that enables direct integration with the segment-anything package.

Conclusion: 查询特定的特征空间变换是提升大规模检索任务的有效方法。

Abstract: Massive-scale pretraining has made vision-language models increasingly
popular for image-to-image and text-to-image retrieval across a broad
collection of domains. However, these models do not perform well when used for
challenging retrieval tasks, such as instance retrieval in very large-scale
image collections. Recent work has shown that linear transformations of VLM
features trained for instance retrieval can improve performance by emphasizing
subspaces that relate to the domain of interest. In this paper, we explore a
more extreme version of this specialization by learning to map a given query to
a query-specific feature space transformation. Because this transformation is
linear, it can be applied with minimal computational cost to millions of image
embeddings, making it effective for large-scale retrieval or re-ranking.
Results show that this method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
alternatives, including those that require many orders of magnitude more
computation at query time.

relative directional relationships, and canonical orientation understanding.

across synthetic and real-world scenarios, DORI provides insights on how
multi-modal systems understand object orientations. Our evaluation of 15
state-of-the-art vision-language models reveals critical limitations: even the
best models achieve only 54.2% accuracy on coarse tasks and 33.0% on granular
orientation judgments, with performance deteriorating for tasks requiring
reference frame shifts or compound rotations. These findings demonstrate the
need for dedicated orientation representation mechanisms, as models show
systematic inability to perform precise angular estimations, track orientation
changes across viewpoints, and understand compound rotations - suggesting
limitations in their internal 3D spatial representations. As the first
diagnostic framework specifically designed for orientation awareness in
multimodal systems, DORI offers implications for improving robotic control, 3D
scene reconstruction, and human-AI interaction in physical environments. DORI

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffPhy是一个通过微调预训练视频扩散模型实现物理正确和逼真视频生成的框架，利用大语言模型（LLM）和多模态大语言模型（MLLM）指导生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频扩散模型在生成视觉效果上表现优异，但在物理效果合成上仍有挑战，DiffPhy旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过LLM从文本提示中推理物理上下文，并用MLLM作为监督信号，引入新的训练目标确保物理正确性和语义一致性。

Result: 在公开基准测试中，DiffPhy在多样化物理相关场景中实现了最先进的生成效果。

Conclusion: DiffPhy通过结合LLM和MLLM，显著提升了视频生成中的物理正确性和逼真度。

Abstract: Recent video diffusion models have demonstrated their great capability in
generating visually-pleasing results, while synthesizing the correct physical
effects in generated videos remains challenging. The complexity of real-world
motions, interactions, and dynamics introduce great difficulties when learning
physics from data. In this work, we propose DiffPhy, a generic framework that
enables physically-correct and photo-realistic video generation by fine-tuning
a pre-trained video diffusion model. Our method leverages large language models
(LLMs) to explicitly reason a comprehensive physical context from the text
prompt and use it to guide the generation. To incorporate physical context into
the diffusion model, we leverage a Multimodal large language model (MLLM) as a
supervisory signal and introduce a set of novel training objectives that
jointly enforce physical correctness and semantic consistency with the input
text. We also establish a high-quality physical video dataset containing
diverse phyiscal actions and events to facilitate effective finetuning.
Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that DiffPhy is able to
produce state-of-the-art results across diverse physics-related scenarios. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超高分辨率脑MRI分割面临标注数据不足和高计算需求的挑战。

Method: 利用低分辨率粗标签作为参考，回归带符号距离变换图，并采用类条件分割策略。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了方法的优越性能和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法在减少标注成本的同时，提升了分割的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Although deep learning has shown great success in 3D brain MRI segmentation,
achieving accurate and efficient segmentation of ultra-high-resolution brain
images remains challenging due to the lack of labeled training data for
fine-scale anatomical structures and high computational demands. In this work,
we propose a novel framework that leverages easily accessible, low-resolution
coarse labels as spatial references and guidance, without incurring additional
annotation cost. Instead of directly predicting discrete segmentation maps, our
approach regresses per-class signed distance transform maps, enabling smooth,
boundary-aware supervision. Furthermore, to enhance scalability,
generalizability, and efficiency, we introduce a scalable class-conditional
segmentation strategy, where the model learns to segment one class at a time
conditioned on a class-specific input. This novel design not only reduces
memory consumption during both training and testing, but also allows the model
to generalize to unseen anatomical classes. We validate our method through
comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets,
demonstrating its superior performance and scalability compared to conventional
segmentation approaches.

TL;DR: MedBridge是一个轻量级多模态适应框架，通过重新利用预训练的视觉语言模型（VLM）实现准确的医学图像诊断，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言基础模型在自然图像分类上表现优异，但在医学图像上因领域差异表现不佳，而训练医学基础模型需要大量资源。MedBridge旨在以最小开销弥合这一差距。

Method: MedBridge包含三个关键组件：1）Focal Sampling模块提取高分辨率局部区域；2）Query Encoder（QEncoder）注入可学习查询；3）Mixture of Experts机制利用多样化VLM的互补优势。

Result: 在五个医学影像基准测试中，MedBridge在跨领域和领域内适应任务中表现优异，AUC提升6-15%。

Conclusion: MedBridge有效利用基础模型实现数据高效的医学诊断，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent vision-language foundation models deliver state-of-the-art results on
natural image classification but falter on medical images due to pronounced
domain shifts. At the same time, training a medical foundation model requires
substantial resources, including extensive annotated data and high
computational capacity. To bridge this gap with minimal overhead, we introduce
MedBridge, a lightweight multimodal adaptation framework that re-purposes
pretrained VLMs for accurate medical image diagnosis. MedBridge comprises three
key components. First, a Focal Sampling module that extracts high-resolution
local regions to capture subtle pathological features and compensate for the
limited input resolution of general-purpose VLMs. Second, a Query Encoder
(QEncoder) injects a small set of learnable queries that attend to the frozen
feature maps of VLM, aligning them with medical semantics without retraining
the entire backbone. Third, a Mixture of Experts mechanism, driven by learnable
queries, harnesses the complementary strength of diverse VLMs to maximize
diagnostic performance. We evaluate MedBridge on five medical imaging
benchmarks across three key adaptation tasks, demonstrating its superior
performance in both cross-domain and in-domain adaptation settings, even under
varying levels of training data availability. Notably, MedBridge achieved over
6-15% improvement in AUC compared to state-of-the-art VLM adaptation methods in
multi-label thoracic disease diagnosis, underscoring its effectiveness in
leveraging foundation models for accurate and data-efficient medical diagnosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OMCRG任务反映了自然的双向互动，并提出了在生成音频和面部响应之间实现同步的新挑战。

Method: 通过引入文本作为中间模态来桥接音频和面部响应，提出了OmniResponse模型，结合了Chrono-Text和TempoVoice两个新组件。

Result: OmniResponse在语义语音内容、视听同步和生成质量方面显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: OmniResponse为OMCRG任务提供了有效的解决方案，并发布了ResponseNet数据集以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Online Multimodal Conversational Response
Generation (OMCRG), a novel task that aims to online generate synchronized
verbal and non-verbal listener feedback, conditioned on the speaker's
multimodal input. OMCRG reflects natural dyadic interactions and poses new
challenges in achieving synchronization between the generated audio and facial
responses of the listener. To address these challenges, we innovatively
introduce text as an intermediate modality to bridge the audio and facial
responses. We hence propose OmniResponse, a Multimodal Large Language Model
(MLLM) that autoregressively generates high-quality multi-modal listener
responses. OmniResponse leverages a pretrained LLM enhanced with two novel
components: Chrono-Text, which temporally anchors generated text tokens, and
TempoVoice, a controllable online TTS module that produces speech synchronized
with facial reactions. To support further OMCRG research, we present
ResponseNet, a new dataset comprising 696 high-quality dyadic interactions
featuring synchronized split-screen videos, multichannel audio, transcripts,
and facial behavior annotations. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on
ResponseNet demonstrate that OmniResponse significantly outperforms baseline
models in terms of semantic speech content, audio-visual synchronization, and
generation quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种称为“矩核”的简单卷积核形式，用于实现旋转和反射对称性的等变性，解决了传统方法数学复杂的问题，并在生物医学图像分析任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旋转和反射对称性在生物医学图像分析中至关重要，但传统利用这些对称性的方法因数学复杂性（如表示理论）而未被广泛采用。

Method: 提出“矩核”概念，证明所有等变核必须采用这种形式，并通过标准卷积模块实现等变神经网络。

Result: 在分类、3D图像配准和细胞分割等任务中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 矩核提供了一种简单且通用的方式来实现对称性等变性，为生物医学图像分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: The principle of translation equivariance (if an input image is translated an
output image should be translated by the same amount), led to the development
of convolutional neural networks that revolutionized machine vision. Other
symmetries, like rotations and reflections, play a similarly critical role,
especially in biomedical image analysis, but exploiting these symmetries has
not seen wide adoption. We hypothesize that this is partially due to the
mathematical complexity of methods used to exploit these symmetries, which
often rely on representation theory, a bespoke concept in differential geometry
and group theory. In this work, we show that the same equivariance can be
achieved using a simple form of convolution kernels that we call ``moment
kernels,'' and prove that all equivariant kernels must take this form. These
are a set of radially symmetric functions of a spatial position $x$, multiplied
by powers of the components of $x$ or the identity matrix. We implement
equivariant neural networks using standard convolution modules, and provide
architectures to execute several biomedical image analysis tasks that depend on
equivariance principles: classification (outputs are invariant under orthogonal
transforms), 3D image registration (outputs transform like a vector), and cell
segmentation (quadratic forms defining ellipses transform like a matrix).

*Briglia Maria Rosaria,Mujtaba Hussain Mirza,Giuseppe Lisanti,Iacopo Masi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 对抗训练（AT）在扩散模型（DMs）中的作用与分类器不同，它要求等变性以保持扩散过程与数据分布一致，从而提升鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究对抗训练在扩散模型中的独特作用，区别于分类器中的输出不变性，以解决数据噪声和异常值问题。

Method: 通过添加随机噪声（类似随机平滑）或对抗噪声（类似AT）来无缝集成到扩散训练中，无需假设噪声模型。

Result: 在低维和高维数据集上验证了方法的有效性，并在CIFAR-10、CelebA和LSUN Bedroom等基准测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法增强了扩散模型对噪声、数据损坏和对抗攻击的鲁棒性，同时具备处理极端变异性和防止记忆化的能力。

Abstract: We answer the question in the title, showing that adversarial training (AT)
for diffusion models (DMs) fundamentally differs from classifiers: while AT in
classifiers enforces output invariance, AT in DMs requires equivariance to keep
the diffusion process aligned with the data distribution. AT is a way to
enforce smoothness in the diffusion flow, improving robustness to outliers and
corrupted data. Unlike prior art, our method makes no assumptions about the
noise model and integrates seamlessly into diffusion training by adding random
noise, similar to randomized smoothing, or adversarial noise, akin to AT. This
enables intrinsic capabilities such as handling noisy data, dealing with
extreme variability such as outliers, preventing memorization, and improving
robustness. We rigorously evaluate our approach with proof-of-concept datasets
with known distributions in low- and high-dimensional space, thereby taking a
perfect measure of errors; we further evaluate on standard benchmarks such as
CIFAR-10, CelebA and LSUN Bedroom, showing strong performance under severe
noise, data corruption, and iterative adversarial attacks.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种融合卫星和无人机（UAS）图像的超分辨率方法，通过结合两者的优势，显著提高了农作物生物量和氮含量的估算精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星和无人机在精准农业中各具优缺点，卫星覆盖广但分辨率低，无人机分辨率高但成本高且覆盖有限。研究旨在通过融合两者数据，实现低成本高效的数据利用。

Method: 采用超分辨率方法融合卫星和无人机图像，通过光谱扩展将无人机RGB数据扩展到植被红边和近红外区域，生成高分辨率Sentinel-2图像。

Result: 生物量和氮含量估算精度分别提高了18%和31%，且无人机数据仅需部分采集，降低了成本。

Conclusion: 该框架轻量且可扩展，适用于农场实际应用，即使在卫星数据不可用时仍有效。

Abstract: Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and satellites are key data sources for
precision agriculture, yet each presents trade-offs. Satellite data offer broad
spatial, temporal, and spectral coverage but lack the resolution needed for
many precision farming applications, while UAS provide high spatial detail but
are limited by coverage and cost, especially for hyperspectral data. This study
presents a novel framework that fuses satellite and UAS imagery using
super-resolution methods. By integrating data across spatial, spectral, and
temporal domains, we leverage the strengths of both platforms cost-effectively.
We use estimation of cover crop biomass and nitrogen (N) as a case study to
evaluate our approach. By spectrally extending UAS RGB data to the vegetation
red edge and near-infrared regions, we generate high-resolution Sentinel-2
imagery and improve biomass and N estimation accuracy by 18% and 31%,
respectively. Our results show that UAS data need only be collected from a
subset of fields and time points. Farmers can then 1) enhance the spectral
detail of UAS RGB imagery; 2) increase the spatial resolution by using
satellite data; and 3) extend these enhancements spatially and across the
growing season at the frequency of the satellite flights. Our SRCNN-based
spectral extension model shows considerable promise for model transferability
over other cropping systems in the Upper and Lower Chesapeake Bay regions.
Additionally, it remains effective even when cloud-free satellite data are
unavailable, relying solely on the UAS RGB input. The spatial extension model
produces better biomass and N predictions than models built on raw UAS RGB
images. Once trained with targeted UAS RGB data, the spatial extension model
allows farmers to stop repeated UAS flights. While we introduce
super-resolution advances, the core contribution is a lightweight and scalable
system for affordable on-farm use.

TL;DR: LoopGNN是一种图神经网络架构，通过利用视觉相似关键帧的团来提高闭环检测的精度和效率，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统闭环检测依赖计算昂贵的几何验证，限制了在线SLAM场景中的实时性。

Method: 提出LoopGNN，利用图神经网络在关键帧团中传播特征编码，提高闭环共识估计。

Result: 在TartanDrive 2.0和NCLT数据集上表现优于传统基线，计算效率更高。

Conclusion: LoopGNN在保持高召回率的同时提高了闭环检测的精度，且对特征编码类型鲁棒。

Abstract: Visual loop closure detection traditionally relies on place recognition
methods to retrieve candidate loops that are validated using computationally
expensive RANSAC-based geometric verification. As false positive loop closures
significantly degrade downstream pose graph estimates, verifying a large number
of candidates in online simultaneous localization and mapping scenarios is
constrained by limited time and compute resources. While most deep loop closure
detection approaches only operate on pairs of keyframes, we relax this
constraint by considering neighborhoods of multiple keyframes when detecting
loops. In this work, we introduce LoopGNN, a graph neural network architecture
that estimates loop closure consensus by leveraging cliques of visually similar
keyframes retrieved through place recognition. By propagating deep feature
encodings among nodes of the clique, our method yields high-precision estimates
while maintaining high recall. Extensive experimental evaluations on the
TartanDrive 2.0 and NCLT datasets demonstrate that LoopGNN outperforms
traditional baselines. Additionally, an ablation study across various keypoint
extractors demonstrates that our method is robust, regardless of the type of
deep feature encodings used, and exhibits higher computational efficiency
compared to classical geometric verification baselines. We release our code,
supplementary material, and keyframe data at

Motivation: 现有评估设置多为单模态或特定OOD类型，无法全面反映多模态上下文复杂性。

Method: 利用十个现有VQA基准，分类为ID、近OOD和远OOD数据集，并通过Mahalanobis距离量化分布偏移。

Result: 全面比较现有鲁棒微调方法，分析单模态与多模态偏移的交互及模态重要性。

Conclusion: 为开发更鲁棒的微调方法处理多模态分布偏移提供了指导。

Abstract: Visual question answering (VQA) systems face significant challenges when
adapting to real-world data shifts, especially in multi-modal contexts. While
robust fine-tuning strategies are essential for maintaining performance across
in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, current
evaluation settings are primarily unimodal or particular to some types of OOD,
offering limited insight into the complexities of multi-modal contexts. In this
work, we propose a new benchmark FRAMES-VQA (Fine-Tuning Robustness across
Multi-Modal Shifts in VQA) for evaluating robust fine-tuning for VQA tasks. We
utilize ten existing VQA benchmarks, including VQAv2, IV-VQA, VQA-CP, OK-VQA
and others, and categorize them into ID, near and far OOD datasets covering
uni-modal, multi-modal and adversarial distribution shifts. We first conduct a
comprehensive comparison of existing robust fine-tuning methods. We then
quantify the distribution shifts by calculating the Mahalanobis distance using
uni-modal and multi-modal embeddings extracted from various models. Further, we
perform an extensive analysis to explore the interactions between uni- and
multi-modal shifts as well as modality importance for ID and OOD samples. These
analyses offer valuable guidance on developing more robust fine-tuning methods
to handle multi-modal distribution shifts. The code is available at

Conclusion: MMTBENCH为未来研究提供了挑战性资源，强调了改进视觉与语言处理整合架构的迫切需求。

Abstract: Multimodal tables those that integrate semi structured data with visual
elements such as charts and maps are ubiquitous across real world domains, yet
they pose a formidable challenge to current vision language models (VLMs).
While Large Language models (LLMs) and VLMs have demonstrated strong
capabilities in text and image understanding, their performance on complex,
real world multimodal table reasoning remains unexplored. To bridge this gap,
we introduce MMTBENCH (Multimodal Table Benchmark), a benchmark consisting of
500 real world multimodal tables drawn from diverse real world sources, with a
total of 4021 question answer pairs. MMTBENCH questions cover four question
types (Explicit, Implicit, Answer Mention, and Visual Based), five reasoning
types (Mathematical, Extrema Identification, Fact Verification, Vision Based,
and Others), and eight table types (Single/Multiple Entity, Maps and Charts
with Entities, Single/Multiple Charts, Maps, and Visualizations). Extensive
evaluation of state of the art models on all types reveals substantial
performance gaps, particularly on questions requiring visual-based reasoning
and multi-step inference. These findings show the urgent need for improved
architectures that more tightly integrate vision and language processing. By
providing a challenging, high-quality resource that mirrors the complexity of
real-world tasks, MMTBENCH underscores its value as a resource for future
research on multimodal tables.

Conclusion: 该方法可直接应用于预训练的文本到图像生成模型，实现零样本多对象感知。

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated remarkable abilities in generating
high-fidelity visual content. In this work, we explore how generative models
can further be used not only to synthesize visual content but also to
understand the properties of a scene given a natural image. We formulate scene
understanding as an inverse generative modeling problem, where we seek to find
conditional parameters of a visual generative model to best fit a given natural
image. To enable this procedure to infer scene structure from images
substantially different than those seen during training, we further propose to
build this visual generative model compositionally from smaller models over
pieces of a scene. We illustrate how this procedure enables us to infer the set
of objects in a scene, enabling robust generalization to new test scenes with
an increased number of objects of new shapes. We further illustrate how this
enables us to infer global scene factors, likewise enabling robust
generalization to new scenes. Finally, we illustrate how this approach can be
directly applied to existing pretrained text-to-image generative models for
zero-shot multi-object perception. Code and visualizations are at

TL;DR: SANSA改进了SAM2，使其适用于少样本分割任务，通过显式利用其语义结构，实现了高性能和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2虽然具有强大的分割能力，但其特征表示与任务特定线索纠缠，限制了其在高层次语义理解任务中的应用。

Method: 提出SANSA框架，通过最小任务特定修改，显式利用SAM2的潜在语义结构。

Result: SANSA在少样本分割基准测试中表现优异，支持多种交互方式，且速度更快、模型更紧凑。

Conclusion: SANSA成功将SAM2重新用于少样本分割，展示了其语义结构的潜力。

Abstract: Few-shot segmentation aims to segment unseen object categories from just a
handful of annotated examples. This requires mechanisms that can both identify
semantically related objects across images and accurately produce segmentation
masks. We note that Segment Anything 2 (SAM2), with its prompt-and-propagate
mechanism, offers both strong segmentation capabilities and a built-in feature
matching process. However, we show that its representations are entangled with
task-specific cues optimized for object tracking, which impairs its use for
tasks requiring higher level semantic understanding. Our key insight is that,
despite its class-agnostic pretraining, SAM2 already encodes rich semantic
structure in its features. We propose SANSA (Semantically AligNed Segment
Anything 2), a framework that makes this latent structure explicit, and
repurposes SAM2 for few-shot segmentation through minimal task-specific
modifications. SANSA achieves state-of-the-art performance on few-shot
segmentation benchmarks specifically designed to assess generalization,
outperforms generalist methods in the popular in-context setting, supports
various prompts flexible interaction via points, boxes, or scribbles, and
remains significantly faster and more compact than prior approaches. Code is

TL;DR: ALTER框架通过统一层剪枝、专家路由和微调，显著提升扩散模型的推理效率，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型推理计算开销大，现有加速方法未能有效捕捉时间动态且剪枝与微调策略不匹配。

Method: ALTER采用超网络动态生成剪枝决策并管理时间步路由，统一优化剪枝、路由和微调。

Result: ALTER在20步推理中仅需25.9%的MACs，实现3.64倍加速，同时保持与原模型相同的视觉保真度。

Conclusion: ALTER为资源受限环境提供了一种高效的扩散模型优化方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in generating
high-fidelity images. However, their iterative denoising process results in
significant computational overhead during inference, limiting their practical
deployment in resource-constrained environments. Existing acceleration methods
often adopt uniform strategies that fail to capture the temporal variations
during diffusion generation, while the commonly adopted sequential
pruning-then-fine-tuning strategy suffers from sub-optimality due to the
misalignment between pruning decisions made on pretrained weights and the
model's final parameters. To address these limitations, we introduce ALTER:
All-in-One Layer Pruning and Temporal Expert Routing, a unified framework that
transforms diffusion models into a mixture of efficient temporal experts. ALTER
achieves a single-stage optimization that unifies layer pruning, expert
routing, and model fine-tuning by employing a trainable hypernetwork, which
dynamically generates layer pruning decisions and manages timestep routing to
specialized, pruned expert sub-networks throughout the ongoing fine-tuning of
the UNet. This unified co-optimization strategy enables significant efficiency
gains while preserving high generative quality. Specifically, ALTER achieves
same-level visual fidelity to the original 50-step Stable Diffusion v2.1 model
while utilizing only 25.9% of its total MACs with just 20 inference steps and
delivering a 3.64x speedup through 35% sparsity.

Abstract: We introduce HDRSDR-VQA, a large-scale video quality assessment dataset
designed to facilitate comparative analysis between High Dynamic Range (HDR)

The dataset comprises 960 videos generated from 54 diverse source sequences,
each presented in both HDR and SDR formats across nine distortion levels. To
obtain reliable perceptual quality scores, we conducted a comprehensive
subjective study involving 145 participants and six consumer-grade HDR-capable
televisions. A total of over 22,000 pairwise comparisons were collected and
scaled into Just-Objectionable-Difference (JOD) scores. Unlike prior datasets
that focus on a single dynamic range format or use limited evaluation
protocols, HDRSDR-VQA enables direct content-level comparison between HDR and
SDR versions, supporting detailed investigations into when and why one format
is preferred over the other. The open-sourced part of the dataset is publicly
available to support further research in video quality assessment,
content-adaptive streaming, and perceptual model development.

Conclusion: UniMoGen为角色动画提供了灵活、高效且可控的解决方案，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Motion generation is a cornerstone of computer graphics, animation, gaming,
and robotics, enabling the creation of realistic and varied character
movements. A significant limitation of existing methods is their reliance on
specific skeletal structures, which restricts their versatility across
different characters. To overcome this, we introduce UniMoGen, a novel
UNet-based diffusion model designed for skeleton-agnostic motion generation.
UniMoGen can be trained on motion data from diverse characters, such as humans
and animals, without the need for a predefined maximum number of joints. By
dynamically processing only the necessary joints for each character, our model
achieves both skeleton agnosticism and computational efficiency. Key features
of UniMoGen include controllability via style and trajectory inputs, and the
ability to continue motions from past frames. We demonstrate UniMoGen's
effectiveness on the 100style dataset, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in diverse character motion generation. Furthermore, when trained on
both the 100style and LAFAN1 datasets, which use different skeletons, UniMoGen
achieves high performance and improved efficiency across both skeletons. These
results highlight UniMoGen's potential to advance motion generation by
providing a flexible, efficient, and controllable solution for a wide range of
character animations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对开放词汇语义分割（OVSS）的测试时适应（TTA）方法MLMP，通过多级多提示熵最小化，显著优于分类任务的TTA基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前TTA研究主要集中在图像分类任务，而密集预测任务（如OVSS）被忽视，因此需要一种专门的方法。

Method: MLMP方法结合中间视觉编码器层特征，并在全局CLS标记和局部像素级别使用多提示模板进行熵最小化。

Result: 实验表明，MLMP在82种测试场景中显著优于分类任务的TTA基线。

Conclusion: MLMP为开放词汇分割的TTA研究提供了标准化基准，并展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Recently, test-time adaptation has attracted wide interest in the context of
vision-language models for image classification. However, to the best of our
knowledge, the problem is completely overlooked in dense prediction tasks such
as Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS). In response, we propose a
novel TTA method tailored to adapting VLMs for segmentation during test time.
Unlike TTA methods for image classification, our Multi-Level and Multi-Prompt
(MLMP) entropy minimization integrates features from intermediate
vision-encoder layers and is performed with different text-prompt templates at
both the global CLS token and local pixel-wise levels. Our approach could be
used as plug-and-play for any segmentation network, does not require additional
training data or labels, and remains effective even with a single test sample.
Furthermore, we introduce a comprehensive OVSS TTA benchmark suite, which
integrates a rigorous evaluation protocol, seven segmentation datasets, and 15
common corruptions, with a total of 82 distinct test scenarios, establishing a
standardized and comprehensive testbed for future TTA research in
open-vocabulary segmentation. Our experiments on this suite demonstrate that
our segmentation-tailored method consistently delivers significant gains over
direct adoption of TTA classification baselines.

TL;DR: 研究发现FFN层是ViT推理延迟的主要来源，提出了一种通道空闲机制，通过结构重参数化优化FFN层，显著降低了延迟并保持了精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示FFN层对ViT推理延迟的关键影响，探索优化大规模ViT效率的方法。

Method: 提出通道空闲机制，允许部分特征通道绕过非线性激活函数，形成线性路径以实现结构重参数化。

Result: RePaViT系列模型在延迟显著降低的同时，精度损失小甚至提升，大模型效果更明显。

Conclusion: RePaViT为ViT效率优化提供了新方向，首次将结构重参数化应用于FFN层。

Abstract: We reveal that feedforward network (FFN) layers, rather than attention
layers, are the primary contributors to Vision Transformer (ViT) inference
latency, with their impact signifying as model size increases. This finding
highlights a critical opportunity for optimizing the efficiency of large-scale
ViTs by focusing on FFN layers. In this work, we propose a novel channel idle
mechanism that facilitates post-training structural reparameterization for
efficient FFN layers during testing. Specifically, a set of feature channels
remains idle and bypasses the nonlinear activation function in each FFN layer,
thereby forming a linear pathway that enables structural reparameterization
during inference. This mechanism results in a family of ReParameterizable
Vision Transformers (RePaViTs), which achieve remarkable latency reductions
with acceptable sacrifices (sometimes gains) in accuracy across various ViTs.
The benefits of our method scale consistently with model sizes, demonstrating
greater speed improvements and progressively narrowing accuracy gaps or even
higher accuracies on larger models. In particular, RePa-ViT-Large and
RePa-ViT-Huge enjoy 66.8% and 68.7% speed-ups with +1.7% and +1.1% higher top-1
accuracies under the same training strategy, respectively. RePaViT is the first
to employ structural reparameterization on FFN layers to expedite ViTs to our
best knowledge, and we believe that it represents an auspicious direction for
efficient ViTs. Source code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种细粒度噪声注入技术（FPAN），通过概率性地向标记嵌入添加更大噪声，显著减少扩散模型对训练数据的复制问题，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成高质量图像方面表现出色，但其容易复制训练数据的特性引发了隐私担忧，尤其是当数据包含敏感信息时。

Method: 提出FPAN方法，通过分析不同噪声量的影响，概率性地向标记嵌入添加更大噪声。

Result: FPAN平均减少28.78%的数据复制，优于基线模型和现有噪声添加方法，结合其他方法可进一步减少16.82%的复制。

Conclusion: FPAN是一种有效的隐私保护方法，能在减少数据复制的同时保持图像质量，且与其他方法结合效果更佳。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable potential in generating
high-quality images. However, their tendency to replicate training data raises
serious privacy concerns, particularly when the training datasets contain
sensitive or private information. Existing mitigation strategies primarily
focus on reducing image duplication, modifying the cross-attention mechanism,
and altering the denoising backbone architecture of diffusion models. Moreover,
recent work has shown that adding a consistent small amount of noise to text
embeddings can reduce replication to some degree. In this work, we begin by
analyzing the impact of adding varying amounts of noise. Based on our analysis,
we propose a fine-grained noise injection technique that probabilistically adds
a larger amount of noise to token embeddings. We refer to our method as
Fine-grained Probabilistic Addition of Noise (FPAN). Through our extensive
experiments, we show that our proposed FPAN can reduce replication by an
average of 28.78% compared to the baseline diffusion model without
significantly impacting image quality, and outperforms the prior
consistent-magnitude-noise-addition approach by 26.51%. Moreover, when combined
with other existing mitigation methods, our FPAN approach can further reduce
replication by up to 16.82% with similar, if not improved, image quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在抽象视觉推理（AVR）中表现不足，现有基准和指标未能充分评估多阶段推理过程。

Method: 引入MultiStAR基准和MSEval指标，对17种代表性模型进行实验。

Result: 现有模型在基础感知任务中表现良好，但在复杂规则检测阶段仍有挑战。

Conclusion: MultiStAR和MSEval填补了现有评估方法的不足，揭示了模型在复杂推理中的局限性。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in general visual
reasoning but remain underexplored in Abstract Visual Reasoning (AVR), which
demands higher-order reasoning to identify abstract rules beyond simple
perception. Existing AVR benchmarks focus on single-step reasoning, emphasizing
the end result but neglecting the multi-stage nature of reasoning process. Past
studies found MLLMs struggle with these benchmarks, but it doesn't explain how
they fail. To address this gap, we introduce MultiStAR, a Multi-Stage AVR
benchmark, based on RAVEN, designed to assess reasoning across varying levels
of complexity. Additionally, existing metrics like accuracy only focus on the
final outcomes while do not account for the correctness of intermediate steps.
Therefore, we propose a novel metric, MSEval, which considers the correctness
of intermediate steps in addition to the final outcomes. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on MultiStAR using 17 representative close-source and
open-source MLLMs. The results reveal that while existing MLLMs perform
adequately on basic perception tasks, they continue to face challenges in more
complex rule detection stages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于梯度的对抗攻击方法未考虑点云的异构性，导致扰动过大且易察觉。

Method: 提出WAAttack（加权梯度和自适应步长）和SubAttack（聚焦关键子集）两种策略。

Result: 实验表明新方法在生成隐蔽对抗样本上优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 新方法为点云分类的对抗攻击提供了更有效的设计思路。

Abstract: Gradient-based adversarial attacks have become a dominant approach for
evaluating the robustness of point cloud classification models. However,
existing methods often rely on uniform update rules that fail to consider the
heterogeneous nature of point clouds, resulting in excessive and perceptible
perturbations. In this paper, we rethink the design of gradient-based attacks
by analyzing the limitations of conventional gradient update mechanisms and
propose two new strategies to improve both attack effectiveness and
imperceptibility. First, we introduce WAAttack, a novel framework that
incorporates weighted gradients and an adaptive step-size strategy to account
for the non-uniform contribution of points during optimization. This approach
enables more targeted and subtle perturbations by dynamically adjusting updates
according to the local structure and sensitivity of each point. Second, we
propose SubAttack, a complementary strategy that decomposes the point cloud
into subsets and focuses perturbation efforts on structurally critical regions.
Together, these methods represent a principled rethinking of gradient-based
adversarial attacks for 3D point cloud classification. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
generating highly imperceptible adversarial examples. Code will be released
upon paper acceptance.

TL;DR: HLIP是一种用于3D医学影像的可扩展预训练框架，通过分层注意力机制解决了计算效率问题，并在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D医学影像（如CT和MRI）的高计算需求限制了语言-图像预训练的成功，HLIP旨在解决这一问题。

Method: HLIP采用轻量级分层注意力机制，基于放射学数据的自然层次结构（切片、扫描和研究）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，例如在Rad-ChestCT上AUC提升4.3%，在Pub-Brain-5上平衡准确率提升32.4%。

Conclusion: HLIP证明了直接在未整理的临床数据集上进行预训练是3D医学影像语言-图像预训练的可扩展且有效的方向。

Abstract: Language-image pre-training has demonstrated strong performance in 2D medical
imaging, but its success in 3D modalities such as CT and MRI remains limited
due to the high computational demands of volumetric data, which pose a
significant barrier to training on large-scale, uncurated clinical studies. In
this study, we introduce Hierarchical attention for Language-Image Pre-training
(HLIP), a scalable pre-training framework for 3D medical imaging. HLIP adopts a
lightweight hierarchical attention mechanism inspired by the natural hierarchy
of radiology data: slice, scan, and study. This mechanism exhibits strong
generalizability, e.g., +4.3% macro AUC on the Rad-ChestCT benchmark when
pre-trained on CT-RATE. Moreover, the computational efficiency of HLIP enables
direct training on uncurated datasets. Trained on 220K patients with 3.13
million scans for brain MRI and 240K patients with 1.44 million scans for head
CT, HLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance, e.g., +32.4% balanced ACC on
the proposed publicly available brain MRI benchmark Pub-Brain-5; +1.4% and
+6.9% macro AUC on head CT benchmarks RSNA and CQ500, respectively. These
results demonstrate that, with HLIP, directly pre-training on uncurated
clinical datasets is a scalable and effective direction for language-image
pre-training in 3D medical imaging. The code is available at

Conclusion: GETReason框架显著提升了图像上下文理解的准确性，为相关领域提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Publicly significant images from events hold valuable contextual information,
crucial for journalism and education. However, existing methods often struggle
to extract this relevance accurately. To address this, we introduce GETReason
(Geospatial Event Temporal Reasoning), a framework that moves beyond
surface-level image descriptions to infer deeper contextual meaning. We propose
that extracting global event, temporal, and geospatial information enhances
understanding of an image's significance. Additionally, we introduce GREAT
(Geospatial Reasoning and Event Accuracy with Temporal Alignment), a new metric
for evaluating reasoning-based image understanding. Our layered multi-agent
approach, assessed using a reasoning-weighted metric, demonstrates that
meaningful insights can be inferred, effectively linking images to their
broader event context.

TL;DR: 论文提出Cross-DINO方法，通过结合深度MLP网络和交叉编码模块（CCTM）提升小目标检测性能，并引入类别-尺寸（CS）软标签和Boost Loss损失函数，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小目标检测（SOD）因信息有限和模型预测分数低而具有挑战性，现有Transformer检测器在SOD中表现不足，需要改进。

Method: 提出Cross-DINO方法，结合深度MLP网络和CCTM模块增强小目标特征，引入CS软标签和Boost Loss损失函数。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，COCO上APs达36.4%，优于DINO（+4.4%），且参数和计算量更少。

Conclusion: Cross-DINO有效提升了小目标检测性能，为Transformer检测器在SOD中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Small Object Detection (SOD) poses significant challenges due to limited
information and the model's low class prediction score. While Transformer-based
detectors have shown promising performance, their potential for SOD remains
largely unexplored. In typical DETR-like frameworks, the CNN backbone network,
specialized in aggregating local information, struggles to capture the
necessary contextual information for SOD. The multiple attention layers in the
Transformer Encoder face difficulties in effectively attending to small objects
and can also lead to blurring of features. Furthermore, the model's lower class
prediction score of small objects compared to large objects further increases
the difficulty of SOD. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
approach called Cross-DINO. This approach incorporates the deep MLP network to
aggregate initial feature representations with both short and long range
information for SOD. Then, a new Cross Coding Twice Module (CCTM) is applied to
integrate these initial representations to the Transformer Encoder feature,
enhancing the details of small objects. Additionally, we introduce a new kind
of soft label named Category-Size (CS), integrating the Category and Size of
objects. By treating CS as new ground truth, we propose a new loss function
called Boost Loss to improve the class prediction score of the model. Extensive
experimental results on COCO, WiderPerson, VisDrone, AI-TOD, and SODA-D
datasets demonstrate that Cross-DINO efficiently improves the performance of
DETR-like models on SOD. Specifically, our model achieves 36.4% APs on COCO for
SOD with only 45M parameters, outperforming the DINO by +4.4% APS (36.4% vs.
32.0%) with fewer parameters and FLOPs, under 12 epochs training setting. The
source codes will be available at https://github.com/Med-Process/Cross-DINO.

Result: 在RealEstate10K和MiraData上实现SOTA性能，支持零样本泛化。

Conclusion: EPiC高效、精确且泛化能力强，适用于多种视频控制任务。

Abstract: Recent approaches on 3D camera control in video diffusion models (VDMs) often
create anchor videos to guide diffusion models as a structured prior by
rendering from estimated point clouds following annotated camera trajectories.
However, errors inherent in point cloud estimation often lead to inaccurate
anchor videos. Moreover, the requirement for extensive camera trajectory
annotations further increases resource demands. To address these limitations,
we introduce EPiC, an efficient and precise camera control learning framework
that automatically constructs high-quality anchor videos without expensive
camera trajectory annotations. Concretely, we create highly precise anchor
videos for training by masking source videos based on first-frame visibility.
This approach ensures high alignment, eliminates the need for camera trajectory
annotations, and thus can be readily applied to any in-the-wild video to
generate image-to-video (I2V) training pairs. Furthermore, we introduce
Anchor-ControlNet, a lightweight conditioning module that integrates anchor
video guidance in visible regions to pretrained VDMs, with less than 1% of
backbone model parameters. By combining the proposed anchor video data and
ControlNet module, EPiC achieves efficient training with substantially fewer
parameters, training steps, and less data, without requiring modifications to
the diffusion model backbone typically needed to mitigate rendering
misalignments. Although being trained on masking-based anchor videos, our
method generalizes robustly to anchor videos made with point clouds during
inference, enabling precise 3D-informed camera control. EPiC achieves SOTA
performance on RealEstate10K and MiraData for I2V camera control task,
demonstrating precise and robust camera control ability both quantitatively and
qualitatively. Notably, EPiC also exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to
video-to-video scenarios.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has been widely used in agricultural applications
for non-destructive estimation of plant nutrient composition and precise
determination of nutritional elements in samples. Recently, 3D reconstruction
methods have been used to create implicit neural representations of HSI scenes,
which can help localize the target object's nutrient composition spatially and
spectrally. Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is a cutting-edge implicit
representation that can render hyperspectral channel compositions of each
spatial location from any viewing direction. However, it faces limitations in
training time and rendering speed. In this paper, we propose Hyperspectral
Gaussian Splatting (HS-GS), which combines the state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) with a diffusion model to enable 3D explicit reconstruction of
the hyperspectral scenes and novel view synthesis for the entire spectral
range. To enhance the model's ability to capture fine-grained reflectance
variations across the light spectrum and leverage correlations between adjacent
wavelengths for denoising, we introduce a wavelength encoder to generate
wavelength-specific spherical harmonics offsets. We also introduce a novel
Kullback--Leibler divergence-based loss to mitigate the spectral distribution
gap between the rendered image and the ground truth. A diffusion model is
further applied for denoising the rendered images and generating photorealistic
hyperspectral images. We present extensive evaluations on five diverse
hyperspectral scenes from the Hyper-NeRF dataset to show the effectiveness of
our proposed HS-GS framework. The results demonstrate that HS-GS achieves new
state-of-the-art performance among all previously published methods. Code will
be released upon publication.

Result: 在三个公开医学图像数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过关注弱特征和优化边界，显著提升了少样本医学图像分割的效果。

Abstract: Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation (FSMIS) has been widely used to train a
model that can perform segmentation from only a few annotated images. However,
most existing prototype-based FSMIS methods generate multiple prototypes from
the support image solely by random sampling or local averaging, which can cause
particularly severe boundary blurring due to the tendency for normal features
accounting for the majority of features of a specific category. Consequently,
we propose to focus more attention to those weaker features that are crucial
for clear segmentation boundary. Specifically, we design a Support
Self-Prediction (SSP) module to identify such weak features by comparing true
support mask with one predicted by global support prototype. Then, a Hard
Prototypes Generation (HPG) module is employed to generate multiple hard
prototypes based on these weak features. Subsequently, a Multiple Similarity
Maps Fusion (MSMF) module is devised to generate final segmenting mask in a
dual-path fashion to mitigate the imbalance between foreground and background
in medical images. Furthermore, we introduce a boundary loss to further
constraint the edge of segmentation. Extensive experiments on three publicly
available medical image datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实例分割需要昂贵的像素级标注和大模型，CAST旨在通过半监督学习降低成本并提升性能。

Method: CAST分为三个阶段：1）通过自训练和对比像素校准进行VFM域适应；2）通过多目标损失（结合监督学习和伪标签）蒸馏到紧凑学生模型；3）在标注数据上微调以消除伪标签偏差。核心是实例感知像素级对比损失。

Conclusion: CAST通过实例感知对比损失和多阶段学习，显著提升了半监督实例分割的性能，同时减少了模型大小。

Abstract: Instance segmentation demands costly per-pixel annotations and large models.
We introduce CAST, a semi-supervised knowledge distillation (SSKD) framework
that compresses pretrained vision foundation models (VFM) into compact experts
using limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. CAST unfolds in three
stages: (1) domain adaptation of the VFM teacher(s) via self-training with
contrastive pixel calibration, (2) distillation into a compact student via a
unified multi-objective loss that couples standard supervision and
pseudo-labels with our instance-aware pixel-wise contrastive term, and (3)
fine-tuning on labeled data to remove residual pseudo-label bias. Central to
CAST is an \emph{instance-aware pixel-wise contrastive loss} that fuses mask
and class scores to mine informative negatives and enforce clear inter-instance
margins. By maintaining this contrastive signal across both adaptation and
distillation, we align teacher and student embeddings and fully leverage
unlabeled images. On Cityscapes and ADE20K, our ~11X smaller student surpasses
its adapted VFM teacher(s) by +3.4 AP (33.9 vs. 30.5) and +1.5 AP (16.7 vs.
15.2) and outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches.

Abstract: Preserving face identity is a critical yet persistent challenge in
diffusion-based image restoration. While reference faces offer a path forward,
existing reference-based methods often fail to fully exploit their potential.
This paper introduces a novel approach that maximizes reference face utility
for improved face restoration and identity preservation. Our method makes three
key contributions: 1) Composite Context, a comprehensive representation that
fuses multi-level (high- and low-level) information from the reference face,
offering richer guidance than prior singular representations. 2) Hard Example
Identity Loss, a novel loss function that leverages the reference face to
address the identity learning inefficiencies found in the existing identity
loss. 3) A training-free method to adapt the model to multi-reference inputs
during inference. The proposed method demonstrably restores high-quality faces
and achieves state-of-the-art identity preserving restoration on benchmarks
such as FFHQ-Ref and CelebA-Ref-Test, consistently outperforming previous work.

Abstract: Personalized image generation aims to integrate user-provided concepts into
text-to-image models, enabling the generation of customized content based on a
given prompt. Recent zero-shot approaches, particularly those leveraging
diffusion transformers, incorporate reference image information through
multi-modal attention mechanism. This integration allows the generated output
to be influenced by both the textual prior from the prompt and the visual prior
from the reference image. However, we observe that when the prompt and
reference image are misaligned, the generated results exhibit a stronger bias
toward the textual prior, leading to a significant loss of reference content.
To address this issue, we propose AlignGen, a Cross-Modality Prior Alignment
mechanism that enhances personalized image generation by: 1) introducing a
learnable token to bridge the gap between the textual and visual priors, 2)
incorporating a robust training strategy to ensure proper prior alignment, and
3) employing a selective cross-modal attention mask within the multi-modal
attention mechanism to further align the priors. Experimental results
demonstrate that AlignGen outperforms existing zero-shot methods and even
surpasses popular test-time optimization approaches.

Abstract: Autonomous driving datasets are essential for validating the progress of
intelligent vehicle algorithms, which include localization, perception, and
prediction. However, existing datasets are predominantly focused on structured
urban environments, which limits the exploration of unstructured and
specialized scenarios, particularly those characterized by significant dust
levels. This paper introduces the LiDARDustX dataset, which is specifically
designed for perception tasks under high-dust conditions, such as those
encountered in mining areas. The LiDARDustX dataset consists of 30,000 LiDAR
frames captured by six different LiDAR sensors, each accompanied by 3D bounding
box annotations and point cloud semantic segmentation. Notably, over 80% of the
dataset comprises dust-affected scenes. By utilizing this dataset, we have
established a benchmark for evaluating the performance of state-of-the-art 3D
detection and segmentation algorithms. Additionally, we have analyzed the
impact of dust on perception accuracy and delved into the causes of these
effects. The data and further information can be accessed at:

Abstract: Land Use Land Cover (LULC) mapping using deep learning significantly enhances
the reliability of LULC classification, aiding in understanding geography,
socioeconomic conditions, poverty levels, and urban sprawl. However, the
scarcity of annotated satellite data, especially in South/East Asian developing
countries, poses a major challenge due to limited funding, diverse

ground truth validated through a three-stage process involving GIS experts. We
benchmark LULC segmentation using DeepLab V3+ across five major classes and
compare performance on Bing and Sentinel-2A imagery. BOLM aims to support
reliable deep models and domain adaptation tasks, addressing critical LULC

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM在专业领域表现不佳，现有PEFT方法忽略了预训练模型中的领域不变关系。

Method: 提出InfoSAM，通过两个基于互信息的目标：压缩领域不变关系并最大化师生模型间的互信息。

Result: 实验验证InfoSAM能显著提升SAM在专业任务中的性能。

Conclusion: InfoSAM为SAM的PEFT提供了鲁棒的蒸馏框架，适用于专业场景。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a vision foundation model, exhibits
impressive zero-shot capabilities in general tasks but struggles in specialized
domains. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is a promising approach to
unleash the potential of SAM in novel scenarios. However, existing PEFT methods
for SAM neglect the domain-invariant relations encoded in the pre-trained
model. To bridge this gap, we propose InfoSAM, an information-theoretic
approach that enhances SAM fine-tuning by distilling and preserving its
pre-trained segmentation knowledge. Specifically, we formulate the knowledge
transfer process as two novel mutual information-based objectives: (i) to
compress the domain-invariant relation extracted from pre-trained SAM,
excluding pseudo-invariant information as possible, and (ii) to maximize mutual
information between the relational knowledge learned by the teacher
(pre-trained SAM) and the student (fine-tuned model). The proposed InfoSAM
establishes a robust distillation framework for PEFT of SAM. Extensive
experiments across diverse benchmarks validate InfoSAM's effectiveness in
improving SAM family's performance on real-world tasks, demonstrating its
adaptability and superiority in handling specialized scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于点检测的半监督计数方法，通过伪标签和点区域（P2R）方案解决点对点（P2P）监督中的伪标签置信度传播问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点检测方法在密集人群定位和计数中表现优异，但标注成本高。论文旨在通过半监督框架减少标注需求。

Method: 提出点特定激活图（PSAM）分析问题，并设计点区域（P2R）方案替代P2P，以共享伪标签置信度。

Result: 实验表明P2R在半监督计数和无监督域适应中有效解决了PSAM发现的问题。

Conclusion: P2R方案显著提升了伪标签的可靠性，减少了标注需求，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Point detection has been developed to locate pedestrians in crowded scenes by
training a counter through a point-to-point (P2P) supervision scheme. Despite
its excellent localization and counting performance, training a point-based
counter still faces challenges concerning annotation labor: hundreds to
thousands of points are required to annotate a single sample capturing a dense
crowd. In this paper, we integrate point-based methods into a semi-supervised
counting framework based on pseudo-labeling, enabling the training of a counter
with only a few annotated samples supplemented by a large volume of
pseudo-labeled data. However, during implementation, the training encounters
issues as the confidence for pseudo-labels fails to be propagated to background
pixels via the P2P. To tackle this challenge, we devise a point-specific
activation map (PSAM) to visually interpret the phenomena occurring during the
ill-posed training. Observations from the PSAM suggest that the feature map is
excessively activated by the loss for unlabeled data, causing the decoder to
misinterpret these over-activations as pedestrians. To mitigate this issue, we
propose a point-to-region (P2R) scheme to substitute P2P, which segments out
local regions rather than detects a point corresponding to a pedestrian for
supervision. Consequently, pixels in the local region can share the same
confidence with the corresponding pseudo points. Experimental results in both
semi-supervised counting and unsupervised domain adaptation highlight the
advantages of our method, illustrating P2R can resolve issues identified in
PSAM. The code is available at https://github.com/Elin24/P2RLoss.

TL;DR: UniTalk是一个专为主动说话人检测设计的新数据集，强调挑战性场景以提升模型泛化能力。相比传统数据集如AVA，UniTalk更关注多样化的真实世界条件，包括多语言、嘈杂背景和拥挤场景。实验表明，现有模型在UniTalk上表现不佳，但训练后泛化能力更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据集（如AVA）主要基于老电影，存在显著的领域差距。UniTalk旨在填补这一空白，提供更贴近真实世界多样性和挑战性的数据。

Method: UniTalk包含44.5小时视频，涵盖48,693个说话人身份，并标注了帧级主动说话人信息。数据集覆盖多种视频类型，反映真实场景。

Result: 现有模型在AVA上表现优异，但在UniTalk上未能饱和，表明真实条件下的主动说话人检测任务尚未解决。训练于UniTalk的模型在Talkies、ASW和AVA上泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: UniTalk为主动说话人检测设立了新基准，为开发更具适应性和鲁棒性的模型提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: We present UniTalk, a novel dataset specifically designed for the task of
active speaker detection, emphasizing challenging scenarios to enhance model
generalization. Unlike previously established benchmarks such as AVA, which
predominantly features old movies and thus exhibits significant domain gaps,
UniTalk focuses explicitly on diverse and difficult real-world conditions.
These include underrepresented languages, noisy backgrounds, and crowded scenes
- such as multiple visible speakers speaking concurrently or in overlapping
turns. It contains over 44.5 hours of video with frame-level active speaker
annotations across 48,693 speaking identities, and spans a broad range of video
types that reflect real-world conditions. Through rigorous evaluation, we show
that state-of-the-art models, while achieving nearly perfect scores on AVA,
fail to reach saturation on UniTalk, suggesting that the ASD task remains far
from solved under realistic conditions. Nevertheless, models trained on UniTalk
demonstrate stronger generalization to modern "in-the-wild" datasets like
Talkies and ASW, as well as to AVA. UniTalk thus establishes a new benchmark
for active speaker detection, providing researchers with a valuable resource
for developing and evaluating versatile and resilient models.

Motivation: 解决第一人称视角在空间和上下文查询中的局限性，通过引入第三人称视角提供全局信息。

Method: 提出E3VQA基准和M3CoT提示技术，整合多视角场景图以增强推理能力。

Result: M3CoT显著提升模型性能（GPT-4o和Gemini 2.0 Flash分别提高4.84%和5.94%）。

Conclusion: 多视角输入对提升LVLMs推理能力具有重要价值，同时揭示了其局限性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in interactive
applications such as virtual and augmented reality, where first-person
(egocentric) view captured by head-mounted cameras serves as key input. While
this view offers fine-grained cues about user attention and hand-object
interactions, their narrow field of view and lack of global context often lead
to failures on spatially or contextually demanding queries. To address this, we
introduce a framework that augments egocentric inputs with third-person
(exocentric) views, providing complementary information such as global scene
layout and object visibility to LVLMs. We present E3VQA, the first benchmark
for multi-view question answering with 4K high-quality question-answer pairs
grounded in synchronized ego-exo image pairs. Additionally, we propose M3CoT, a
training-free prompting technique that constructs a unified scene
representation by integrating scene graphs from three complementary
perspectives. M3CoT enables LVLMs to reason more effectively across views,
yielding consistent performance gains (4.84% for GPT-4o and 5.94% for Gemini
2.0 Flash) over a recent CoT baseline. Our extensive evaluation reveals key
strengths and limitations of LVLMs in multi-view reasoning and highlights the
value of leveraging both egocentric and exocentric inputs.

TL;DR: 论文提出Cross-modal RAG框架，通过分解查询和图像为子维度组件，结合稀疏和密集检索策略，显著提升文本到图像生成的检索和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强生成方法在复杂查询下表现不佳，无法从单一图像中获取所有所需元素，需改进。

Method: 提出混合检索策略（稀疏+密集），分解查询和图像为子维度，利用多模态大模型选择性生成图像。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于基线方法，检索和生成质量均有提升。

Conclusion: Cross-modal RAG框架有效解决了复杂查询下的图像生成问题，兼具高效性。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation increasingly demands access to domain-specific,
fine-grained, and rapidly evolving knowledge that pretrained models cannot
fully capture. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods attempt to
address this by retrieving globally relevant images, but they fail when no
single image contains all desired elements from a complex user query. We
propose Cross-modal RAG, a novel framework that decomposes both queries and
images into sub-dimensional components, enabling subquery-aware retrieval and
generation. Our method introduces a hybrid retrieval strategy - combining a
sub-dimensional sparse retriever with a dense retriever - to identify a
Pareto-optimal set of images, each contributing complementary aspects of the
query. During generation, a multimodal large language model is guided to
selectively condition on relevant visual features aligned to specific
subqueries, ensuring subquery-aware image synthesis. Extensive experiments on
MS-COCO, Flickr30K, WikiArt, CUB, and ImageNet-LT demonstrate that Cross-modal
RAG significantly outperforms existing baselines in both retrieval and
generation quality, while maintaining high efficiency.

Result: TiUE在推理速度和图像质量上优于LCM、SD-Turbo和SwiftBrushv2。

Conclusion: TiUE为T2I扩散模型提供了一种高效且高质量的蒸馏方案。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have made remarkable advancements in
generative modeling; however, they face a trade-off between inference speed and
image quality, posing challenges for efficient deployment. Existing distilled
T2I models can generate high-fidelity images with fewer sampling steps, but
often struggle with diversity and quality, especially in one-step models. From
our analysis, we observe redundant computations in the UNet encoders. Our
findings suggest that, for T2I diffusion models, decoders are more adept at
capturing richer and more explicit semantic information, while encoders can be
effectively shared across decoders from diverse time steps. Based on these
observations, we introduce the first Time-independent Unified Encoder TiUE for
the student model UNet architecture, which is a loop-free image generation
approach for distilling T2I diffusion models. Using a one-pass scheme, TiUE
shares encoder features across multiple decoder time steps, enabling parallel
sampling and significantly reducing inference time complexity. In addition, we
incorporate a KL divergence term to regularize noise prediction, which enhances
the perceptual realism and diversity of the generated images. Experimental
results demonstrate that TiUE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including
LCM, SD-Turbo, and SwiftBrushv2, producing more diverse and realistic results
while maintaining the computational efficiency.

Abstract: While unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer wide-area, high-altitude coverage
for anomaly detection, they face challenges such as dynamic viewpoints, scale
variations, and complex scenes. Existing datasets and methods, mainly designed
for fixed ground-level views, struggle to adapt to these conditions, leading to
significant performance drops in drone-view scenarios. To bridge this gap, we
introduce A2Seek (Aerial Anomaly Seek), a large-scale, reasoning-centric
benchmark dataset for aerial anomaly understanding. This dataset covers various
scenarios and environmental conditions, providing high-resolution real-world
aerial videos with detailed annotations, including anomaly categories,
frame-level timestamps, region-level bounding boxes, and natural language
explanations for causal reasoning. Building on this dataset, we propose
A2Seek-R1, a novel reasoning framework that generalizes R1-style strategies to
aerial anomaly understanding, enabling a deeper understanding of "Where"
anomalies occur and "Why" they happen in aerial frames. To this end, A2Seek-R1
first employs a graph-of-thought (GoT)-guided supervised fine-tuning approach
to activate the model's latent reasoning capabilities on A2Seek. Then, we
introduce Aerial Group Relative Policy Optimization (A-GRPO) to design
rule-based reward functions tailored to aerial scenarios. Furthermore, we
propose a novel "seeking" mechanism that simulates UAV flight behavior by
directing the model's attention to informative regions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that A2Seek-R1 achieves up to a 22.04% improvement in AP for
prediction accuracy and a 13.9% gain in mIoU for anomaly localization,
exhibiting strong generalization across complex environments and
out-of-distribution scenarios. Our dataset and code will be released at

Conclusion: DvD为文档去扭曲提供了新方法，新基准AnyPhotoDoc6300支持更全面评估。

Abstract: Document dewarping aims to rectify deformations in photographic document
images, thus improving text readability, which has attracted much attention and
made great progress, but it is still challenging to preserve document
structures. Given recent advances in diffusion models, it is natural for us to
consider their potential applicability to document dewarping. However, it is
far from straightforward to adopt diffusion models in document dewarping due to
their unfaithful control on highly complex document images (e.g.,
2000$\times$3000 resolution). In this paper, we propose DvD, the first
generative model to tackle document \textbf{D}ewarping \textbf{v}ia a
\textbf{D}iffusion framework. To be specific, DvD introduces a coordinate-level
denoising instead of typical pixel-level denoising, generating a mapping for
deformation rectification. In addition, we further propose a time-variant
condition refinement mechanism to enhance the preservation of document
structures. In experiments, we find that current document dewarping benchmarks
can not evaluate dewarping models comprehensively. To this end, we present
AnyPhotoDoc6300, a rigorously designed large-scale document dewarping benchmark
comprising 6,300 real image pairs across three distinct domains, enabling
fine-grained evaluation of dewarping models. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed DvD can achieve state-of-the-art performance with
acceptable computational efficiency on multiple metrics across various
benchmarks including DocUNet, DIR300, and AnyPhotoDoc6300. The new benchmark
and code will be publicly available.

Result: VRAG显著减少了长期复合错误，提高了时空一致性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了视频世界模型的基本挑战，并为改进视频生成模型提供了基准。

Abstract: Foundational world models must be both interactive and preserve
spatiotemporal coherence for effective future planning with action choices.
However, present models for long video generation have limited inherent world
modeling capabilities due to two main challenges: compounding errors and
insufficient memory mechanisms. We enhance image-to-video models with
interactive capabilities through additional action conditioning and
autoregressive framework, and reveal that compounding error is inherently
irreducible in autoregressive video generation, while insufficient memory
mechanism leads to incoherence of world models. We propose video retrieval
augmented generation (VRAG) with explicit global state conditioning, which
significantly reduces long-term compounding errors and increases spatiotemporal
consistency of world models. In contrast, naive autoregressive generation with
extended context windows and retrieval-augmented generation prove less
effective for video generation, primarily due to the limited in-context
learning capabilities of current video models. Our work illuminates the
fundamental challenges in video world models and establishes a comprehensive
benchmark for improving video generation models with internal world modeling
capabilities.

Result: 实验表明D-Fusion能有效提升不同强化学习算法中的提示-图像对齐效果。

Conclusion: D-Fusion解决了视觉不一致问题，显著提升了扩散模型的对齐能力。

Abstract: The practical applications of diffusion models have been limited by the
misalignment between generated images and corresponding text prompts. Recent
studies have introduced direct preference optimization (DPO) to enhance the
alignment of these models. However, the effectiveness of DPO is constrained by
the issue of visual inconsistency, where the significant visual disparity
between well-aligned and poorly-aligned images prevents diffusion models from
identifying which factors contribute positively to alignment during
fine-tuning. To address this issue, this paper introduces D-Fusion, a method to
construct DPO-trainable visually consistent samples. On one hand, by performing
mask-guided self-attention fusion, the resulting images are not only
well-aligned, but also visually consistent with given poorly-aligned images. On
the other hand, D-Fusion can retain the denoising trajectories of the resulting
images, which are essential for DPO training. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of D-Fusion in improving prompt-image alignment when applied
to different reinforcement learning algorithms.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖RGB相机，无法应对低光或运动模糊环境，事件相机可解决这些问题。

Method: 先估计头部姿态，再生成身体姿态；引入动态分割模块去除干扰。

Result: 在合成数据集上，动态环境中五项指标中有四项优于基线。

Conclusion: D-EventEgo在事件相机人体姿态估计任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Estimating human pose using a front-facing egocentric camera is essential for
applications such as sports motion analysis, VR/AR, and AI for wearable
devices. However, many existing methods rely on RGB cameras and do not account
for low-light environments or motion blur. Event-based cameras have the
potential to address these challenges. In this work, we introduce a novel task
of human pose estimation using a front-facing event-based camera mounted on the
head and propose D-EventEgo, the first framework for this task. The proposed
method first estimates the head poses, and then these are used as conditions to
generate body poses. However, when estimating head poses, the presence of
dynamic objects mixed with background events may reduce head pose estimation
accuracy. Therefore, we introduce the Motion Segmentation Module to remove
dynamic objects and extract background information. Extensive experiments on
our synthetic event-based dataset derived from EgoBody, demonstrate that our
approach outperforms our baseline in four out of five evaluation metrics in
dynamic environments.

Abstract: Livestreaming often involves interactions between streamers and objects,
which is critical for understanding and regulating web content. While
human-object interaction (HOI) detection has made some progress in
general-purpose video downstream tasks, when applied to recognize the
interaction behaviors between a streamer and different objects in
livestreaming, it tends to focuses too much on the objects and neglects their
interactions with the streamer, which leads to object bias. To solve this
issue, we propose a prototype embedding optimization for human-object
interaction detection (PeO-HOI). First, the livestreaming is preprocessed using
object detection and tracking techniques to extract features of the
human-object (HO) pairs. Then, prototype embedding optimization is adopted to
mitigate the effect of object bias on HOI. Finally, after modelling the
spatio-temporal context between HO pairs, the HOI detection results are
obtained by the prediction head. The experimental results show that the
detection accuracy of the proposed PeO-HOI method has detection accuracies of
37.19%@full, 51.42%@non-rare, 26.20%@rare on the publicly available dataset
VidHOI, 45.13%@full, 62.78%@non-rare and 30.37%@rare on the self-built dataset
BJUT-HOI, which effectively improves the HOI detection performance in
livestreaming.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有全景视频生成模型难以利用预训练的生成先验，主要由于数据集规模有限和空间特征表示差异。

Method: PanoWan采用纬度感知采样避免纬度失真，旋转语义去噪和平铺像素解码确保经度边界无缝过渡。

Result: PanoWan在全景视频生成中达到最先进性能，并在零样本下游任务中表现稳健。

Conclusion: PanoWan通过高效模块和PanoVid数据集，成功将预训练模型提升至全景领域。

Abstract: Panoramic video generation enables immersive 360{\deg} content creation,
valuable in applications that demand scene-consistent world exploration.
However, existing panoramic video generation models struggle to leverage
pre-trained generative priors from conventional text-to-video models for
high-quality and diverse panoramic videos generation, due to limited dataset
scale and the gap in spatial feature representations. In this paper, we
introduce PanoWan to effectively lift pre-trained text-to-video models to the
panoramic domain, equipped with minimal modules. PanoWan employs latitude-aware
sampling to avoid latitudinal distortion, while its rotated semantic denoising
and padded pixel-wise decoding ensure seamless transitions at longitude
boundaries. To provide sufficient panoramic videos for learning these lifted
representations, we contribute PanoVid, a high-quality panoramic video dataset
with captions and diverse scenarios. Consequently, PanoWan achieves
state-of-the-art performance in panoramic video generation and demonstrates
robustness for zero-shot downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法局限于单退化恢复或灰度图像处理，无法满足多退化彩色文档图像的需求。

Method: 提出分层增强框架、双分支局部细化网络和修改的NestUNet架构，采用两阶段训练策略。

Result: 在DocUNet和RealDAE上分别达到0.7721和0.9480的SSIM分数，具有跨域适应性和计算效率。

Conclusion: GL-PGENet在多退化彩色文档图像增强中表现出色，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Document Image Enhancement (DIE) serves as a critical component in Document
AI systems, where its performance substantially determines the effectiveness of
downstream tasks. To address the limitations of existing methods confined to
single-degradation restoration or grayscale image processing, we present Global
with Local Parametric Generation Enhancement Network (GL-PGENet), a novel
architecture designed for multi-degraded color document images, ensuring both
efficiency and robustness in real-world scenarios. Our solution incorporates
three key innovations: First, a hierarchical enhancement framework that
integrates global appearance correction with local refinement, enabling
coarse-to-fine quality improvement. Second, a Dual-Branch Local-Refine Network
with parametric generation mechanisms that replaces conventional direct
prediction, producing enhanced outputs through learned intermediate parametric
representations rather than pixel-wise mapping. This approach enhances local
consistency while improving model generalization. Finally, a modified NestUNet
architecture incorporating dense block to effectively fuse low-level pixel
features and high-level semantic features, specifically adapted for document
image characteristics. In addition, to enhance generalization performance, we
adopt a two-stage training strategy: large-scale pretraining on a synthetic
dataset of 500,000+ samples followed by task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of GL-PGENet, achieving
state-of-the-art SSIM scores of 0.7721 on DocUNet and 0.9480 on RealDAE. The
model also exhibits remarkable cross-domain adaptability and maintains
computational efficiency for high-resolution images without performance
degradation, confirming its practical utility in real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长距离深度成像在自动驾驶和机器人等领域有重要应用，但现有dToF和iToF技术分别存在硬件要求高和相位缠绕、低信噪比的问题。

Method: 采用突发模式发射光脉冲，估计整个突发周期的相位延迟；提出端到端学习框架，联合优化编码函数和深度重建网络。

Result: 通过仿真和原型实验验证了BE-ToF的有效性和实用性。

Conclusion: BE-ToF为长距离高保真深度成像提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Long-distance depth imaging holds great promise for applications such as
autonomous driving and robotics. Direct time-of-flight (dToF) imaging offers
high-precision, long-distance depth sensing, yet demands ultra-short pulse
light sources and high-resolution time-to-digital converters. In contrast,
indirect time-of-flight (iToF) imaging often suffers from phase wrapping and
low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as the sensing distance increases. In this
paper, we introduce a novel ToF imaging paradigm, termed Burst-Encodable
Time-of-Flight (BE-ToF), which facilitates high-fidelity, long-distance depth
imaging. Specifically, the BE-ToF system emits light pulses in burst mode and
estimates the phase delay of the reflected signal over the entire burst period,
thereby effectively avoiding the phase wrapping inherent to conventional iToF
systems. Moreover, to address the low SNR caused by light attenuation over
increasing distances, we propose an end-to-end learnable framework that jointly
optimizes the coding functions and the depth reconstruction network. A
specialized double well function and first-order difference term are
incorporated into the framework to ensure the hardware implementability of the
coding functions. The proposed approach is rigorously validated through
comprehensive simulations and real-world prototype experiments, demonstrating
its effectiveness and practical applicability.

Abstract: This paper introduces Guess the Age of Photos, a web platform engaging users
in estimating the years of historical photographs through two gamified modes:
Guess the Year (predicting a single image's year) and Timeline Challenge
(comparing two images to identify the older). Built with Python, Flask,
Bootstrap, and PostgreSQL, it uses a 10,150-image subset of the Date Estimation
in the Wild dataset (1930-1999). Features like dynamic scoring and leaderboards
boost engagement. Evaluated with 113 users and 15,473 gameplays, the platform
earned a 4.25/5 satisfaction rating. Users excelled in relative comparisons
(65.9% accuracy) over absolute year guesses (25.6% accuracy), with older
decades easier to identify. The platform serves as an educational tool,
fostering historical awareness and analytical skills via interactive
exploration of visual heritage. Furthermore, the platform provides a valuable
resource for studying human perception of temporal cues in images and could be
used to generate annotated data for training and evaluating computer vision
models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为BTP的平衡令牌剪枝方法，通过分阶段剪枝减少视觉令牌数量，显著降低计算开销，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）因图像令牌数量庞大导致计算开销高，现有剪枝方法未充分考虑局部和全局影响。

Method: 提出BTP方法，利用校准集分阶段剪枝，早期关注后续层影响，后期注重局部输出一致性。

Result: 实验表明，BTP能在78%压缩率下平均保留96.7%的原始模型性能。

Conclusion: BTP是一种高效且通用的视觉令牌剪枝方法，适用于多种LVLMs。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive performance across
multi-modal tasks by encoding images into thousands of tokens. However, the
large number of image tokens results in significant computational overhead, and
the use of dynamic high-resolution inputs further increases this burden.
Previous approaches have attempted to reduce the number of image tokens through
token pruning, typically by selecting tokens based on attention scores or image
token diversity. Through empirical studies, we observe that existing methods
often overlook the joint impact of pruning on both the current layer's output
(local) and the outputs of subsequent layers (global), leading to suboptimal
pruning decisions. To address this challenge, we propose Balanced Token Pruning
(BTP), a plug-and-play method for pruning vision tokens. Specifically, our
method utilizes a small calibration set to divide the pruning process into
multiple stages. In the early stages, our method emphasizes the impact of
pruning on subsequent layers, whereas in the deeper stages, the focus shifts
toward preserving the consistency of local outputs. Extensive experiments
across various LVLMs demonstrate the broad effectiveness of our approach on
multiple benchmarks. Our method achieves a 78% compression rate while
preserving 96.7% of the original models' performance on average.

Abstract: While anomaly detection has made significant progress, generating detailed
analyses that incorporate industrial knowledge remains a challenge. To address
this gap, we introduce OmniAD, a novel framework that unifies anomaly detection
and understanding for fine-grained analysis. OmniAD is a multimodal reasoner
that combines visual and textual reasoning processes. The visual reasoning
provides detailed inspection by leveraging Text-as-Mask Encoding to perform
anomaly detection through text generation without manually selected thresholds.
Following this, Visual Guided Textual Reasoning conducts comprehensive analysis
by integrating visual perception. To enhance few-shot generalization, we employ
an integrated training strategy that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with
reinforcement learning (GRPO), incorporating three sophisticated reward
functions. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniAD achieves a performance
of 79.1 on the MMAD benchmark, surpassing models such as Qwen2.5-VL-7B and
GPT-4o. It also shows strong results across multiple anomaly detection
benchmarks. These results highlight the importance of enhancing visual
perception for effective reasoning in anomaly understanding. All codes and
models will be publicly available.

Abstract: Image-to-video (I2V) generation seeks to produce realistic motion sequences
from a single reference image. Although recent methods exhibit strong temporal
consistency, they often struggle when dealing with complex, non-repetitive
human movements, leading to unnatural deformations. To tackle this issue, we
present LatentMove, a DiT-based framework specifically tailored for highly
dynamic human animation. Our architecture incorporates a conditional control
branch and learnable face/body tokens to preserve consistency as well as
fine-grained details across frames. We introduce Complex-Human-Videos (CHV), a
dataset featuring diverse, challenging human motions designed to benchmark the
robustness of I2V systems. We also introduce two metrics to assess the flow and
silhouette consistency of generated videos with their ground truth.
Experimental results indicate that LatentMove substantially improves human
animation quality--particularly when handling rapid, intricate
movements--thereby pushing the boundaries of I2V generation. The code, the CHV
dataset, and the evaluation metrics will be available at https://github.com/

Conclusion: AquaMonitor为水生生物多样性监测提供了重要工具，可直接改进立法水质评估。

Abstract: This paper presents the AquaMonitor dataset, the first large computer vision
dataset of aquatic invertebrates collected during routine environmental
monitoring. While several large species identification datasets exist, they are
rarely collected using standardized collection protocols, and none focus on
aquatic invertebrates, which are particularly laborious to collect. For
AquaMonitor, we imaged all specimens from two years of monitoring whenever
imaging was possible given practical limitations. The dataset enables the
evaluation of automated identification methods for real-life monitoring
purposes using a realistically challenging and unbiased setup. The dataset has
2.7M images from 43,189 specimens, DNA sequences for 1358 specimens, and dry
mass and size measurements for 1494 specimens, making it also one of the
largest biological multi-view and multimodal datasets to date. We define three
benchmark tasks and provide strong baselines for these: 1) Monitoring
benchmark, reflecting real-life deployment challenges such as open-set
recognition, distribution shift, and extreme class imbalance, 2) Classification
benchmark, which follows a standard fine-grained visual categorization setup,
and 3) Few-shot benchmark, which targets classes with only few training
examples from very fine-grained categories. Advancements on the Monitoring
benchmark can directly translate to improvement of aquatic biodiversity
monitoring, which is an important component of regular legislative water
quality assessment in many countries.

Conclusion: SERA在安全关键条件下表现出高效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Ensuring robust and generalizable autonomous driving requires not only broad
scenario coverage but also efficient repair of failure cases, particularly
those related to challenging and safety-critical scenarios. However, existing
scenario generation and selection methods often lack adaptivity and semantic
relevance, limiting their impact on performance improvement. In this paper, we
propose \textbf{SERA}, an LLM-powered framework that enables autonomous driving
systems to self-evolve by repairing failure cases through targeted scenario
recommendation. By analyzing performance logs, SERA identifies failure patterns
and dynamically retrieves semantically aligned scenarios from a structured
bank. An LLM-based reflection mechanism further refines these recommendations
to maximize relevance and diversity. The selected scenarios are used for
few-shot fine-tuning, enabling targeted adaptation with minimal data.
Experiments on the benchmark show that SERA consistently improves key metrics
across multiple autonomous driving baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness
and generalizability under safety-critical conditions.

Conclusion: 方法易于实现且能有效泛化，提升了医学视觉语言处理能力和临床语言理解。

Abstract: The development of large-scale image-text pair datasets has significantly
advanced self-supervised learning in Vision-Language Processing (VLP). However,
directly applying general-domain architectures such as CLIP to medical data
presents challenges, particularly in handling negations and addressing the
inherent data imbalance of medical datasets. To address these issues, we
propose a novel approach that integrates clinically-enhanced dynamic soft
labels and medical graphical alignment, thereby improving clinical
comprehension and the applicability of contrastive loss in medical contexts.
Furthermore, we introduce negation-based hard negatives to deepen the model's
understanding of the complexities of clinical language. Our approach is easily
integrated into the medical CLIP training pipeline and achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks, including zero-shot,
fine-tuned classification, and report retrieval. To comprehensively evaluate
our model's capacity for understanding clinical language, we introduce
CXR-Align, a benchmark uniquely designed to evaluate the understanding of
negation and clinical information within chest X-ray (CXR) datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods are straightforward
to implement and generalize effectively across contrastive learning frameworks,
enhancing medical VLP capabilities and advancing clinical language
understanding in medical imaging.

Motivation: 特征匹配在运动恢复结构（SfM）中耗时严重，需优化无人机图像匹配效率。

Method: 1. 使用图像检索技术选择匹配对；2. 基于MBR生成紧凑图像块，减少冗余IO；3. 在GPU加速级联哈希框架下执行特征匹配，结合几何约束和RANSAC验证。

Result: 在大型无人机数据集上测试，效率提升77.0至100.0倍，精度与传统方法相当。

Conclusion: 该算法为无人机图像特征匹配提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Feature matching dominats the time costs in structure from motion (SfM). The
primary contribution of this study is a GPU data schedule algorithm for
efficient feature matching of Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images. The core
idea is to divide the whole dataset into blocks based on the matrix band
reduction (MBR) and achieve efficient feature matching via GPU-accelerated
cascade hashing. First, match pairs are selected by using an image retrieval
technique, which converts images into global descriptors and searches
high-dimension nearest neighbors with graph indexing. Second, compact image
blocks are iteratively generated from a MBR-based data schedule strategy, which
exploits image connections to avoid redundant data IO (input/output) burden and
increases the usage of GPU computing power. Third, guided by the generated
image blocks, feature matching is executed sequentially within the framework of
GPU-accelerated cascade hashing, and initial candidate matches are refined by
combining a local geometric constraint and RANSAC-based global verification.
For further performance improvement, these two seps are designed to execute
parallelly in GPU and CPU. Finally, the performance of the proposed solution is
evaluated by using large-scale UAV datasets. The results demonstrate that it
increases the efficiency of feature matching with speedup ratios ranging from
77.0 to 100.0 compared with KD-Tree based matching methods, and achieves
comparable accuracy in relative and absolute bundle adjustment (BA). The
proposed algorithm is an efficient solution for feature matching of UAV images.

Conclusion: UAVPairs数据集和训练流程为大规模无人机图像匹配对检索提供了高效解决方案，并在复杂场景中表现更鲁棒。

Abstract: The primary contribution of this paper is a challenging benchmark dataset,
UAVPairs, and a training pipeline designed for match pair retrieval of
large-scale UAV images. First, the UAVPairs dataset, comprising 21,622
high-resolution images across 30 diverse scenes, is constructed; the 3D points
and tracks generated by SfM-based 3D reconstruction are employed to define the
geometric similarity of image pairs, ensuring genuinely matchable image pairs
are used for training. Second, to solve the problem of expensive mining cost
for global hard negative mining, a batched nontrivial sample mining strategy is
proposed, leveraging the geometric similarity and multi-scene structure of the
UAVPairs to generate training samples as to accelerate training. Third,
recognizing the limitation of pair-based losses, the ranked list loss is
designed to improve the discrimination of image retrieval models, which
optimizes the global similarity structure constructed from the positive set and
negative set. Finally, the effectiveness of the UAVPairs dataset and training
pipeline is validated through comprehensive experiments on three distinct
large-scale UAV datasets. The experiment results demonstrate that models
trained with the UAVPairs dataset and the ranked list loss achieve
significantly improved retrieval accuracy compared to models trained on
existing datasets or with conventional losses. Furthermore, these improvements
translate to enhanced view graph connectivity and higher quality of
reconstructed 3D models. The models trained by the proposed approach perform
more robustly compared with hand-crafted global features, particularly in
challenging repetitively textured scenes and weakly textured scenes. For match
pair retrieval of large-scale UAV images, the trained image retrieval models
offer an effective solution. The dataset would be made publicly available at
https://github.com/json87/UAVPairs.

Conclusion: 在对抗性域适应中，同时保证可迁移性和可区分性是必要的，RLGLC框架为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we addressed the limitation of relying solely on distribution
alignment and source-domain empirical risk minimization in Unsupervised Domain
Adaptation (UDA). Our information-theoretic analysis showed that this standard
adversarial-based framework neglects the discriminability of target-domain
features, leading to suboptimal performance. To bridge this
theoretical-practical gap, we defined "good representation learning" as
guaranteeing both transferability and discriminability, and proved that an
additional loss term targeting target-domain discriminability is necessary.
Building on these insights, we proposed a novel adversarial-based UDA framework
that explicitly integrates a domain alignment objective with a
discriminability-enhancing constraint. Instantiated as Domain-Invariant
Representation Learning with Global and Local Consistency (RLGLC), our method
leverages Asymmetrically-Relaxed Wasserstein of Wasserstein Distance (AR-WWD)
to address class imbalance and semantic dimension weighting, and employs a
local consistency mechanism to preserve fine-grained target-domain
discriminative information. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate that RLGLC consistently surpasses state-of-the-art
methods, confirming the value of our theoretical perspective and underscoring
the necessity of enforcing both transferability and discriminability in
adversarial-based UDA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出ELE-SAM模型，改进SAM以解决电力传输走廊危险分割任务，通过上下文感知提示适配器和高保真掩码解码器提升性能，并构建了首个大规模数据集ELE-40K。

Motivation: 电力传输走廊危险分割对保障电力传输安全至关重要，但现有SAM模型在复杂场景下表现不佳，尤其是对精细结构目标的处理。

Method: 提出ELE-SAM，包括上下文感知提示适配器（整合全局-局部特征）和高保真掩码解码器（利用多粒度掩码特征）。

Result: 在ELE-40K数据集上，ELE-SAM比基线模型平均提升16.8% mIoU和20.6% mBIoU，并在HQSeg-44K上进一步验证其有效性。

Conclusion: ELE-SAM显著提升了复杂场景下的分割性能，为电力传输安全提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Power transmission corridor hazard segmentation (PTCHS) aims to separate
transmission equipment and surrounding hazards from complex background,
conveying great significance to maintaining electric power transmission safety.
Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has emerged as a foundational vision
model and pushed the boundaries of segmentation tasks. However, SAM struggles
to deal with the target objects in complex transmission corridor scenario,
especially those with fine structure. In this paper, we propose ELE-SAM,
adapting SAM for the PTCHS task. Technically, we develop a Context-Aware Prompt
Adapter to achieve better prompt tokens via incorporating global-local features
and focusing more on key regions. Subsequently, to tackle the hazard objects
with fine structure in complex background, we design a High-Fidelity Mask
Decoder by leveraging multi-granularity mask features and then scaling them to
a higher resolution. Moreover, to train ELE-SAM and advance this field, we
construct the ELE-40K benchmark, the first large-scale and real-world dataset
for PTCHS including 44,094 image-mask pairs. Experimental results for ELE-40K
demonstrate the superior performance that ELE-SAM outperforms the baseline
model with the average 16.8% mIoU and 20.6% mBIoU performance improvement.
Moreover, compared with the state-of-the-art method on HQSeg-44K, the average
2.9% mIoU and 3.8% mBIoU absolute improvements further validate the
effectiveness of our method on high-quality generic object segmentation. The
source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Hhaizee/ELE-SAM.

*Woonho Ko,Jin Bok Park,Il Yong Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于扩散模型的无自回归（ARFree）视频预测框架，解决了传统自回归方法在远未来帧中的误差传播问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长期视频预测方法依赖自回归机制，导致远未来帧误差传播严重。

Method: ARFree框架包含运动预测模块和训练方法，直接预测未来帧组，提升运动连续性和上下文一致性。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验表明，ARFree优于现有视频预测方法。

Conclusion: ARFree框架通过无自回归机制显著提升了视频预测性能。

Abstract: Existing long-term video prediction methods often rely on an autoregressive
video prediction mechanism. However, this approach suffers from error
propagation, particularly in distant future frames. To address this limitation,
this paper proposes the first AutoRegression-Free (ARFree) video prediction
framework using diffusion models. Different from an autoregressive video
prediction mechanism, ARFree directly predicts any future frame tuples from the
context frame tuple. The proposed ARFree consists of two key components: 1) a
motion prediction module that predicts a future motion using motion feature
extracted from the context frame tuple; 2) a training method that improves
motion continuity and contextual consistency between adjacent future frame
tuples. Our experiments with two benchmark datasets show that the proposed
ARFree video prediction framework outperforms several state-of-the-art video
prediction methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学插图生成需要高精度和专业知识，目前缺乏评估AI在此任务上的基准，因此填补这一空白具有实际价值。

Method: 通过专家和多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）收集1,120个科学论文中的实例，构建SridBench基准，并在六个维度上评估模型表现。

Result: 实验显示，顶级模型在语义保真度和结构准确性等方面仍不及人类，存在文本/视觉清晰度和科学正确性问题。

Conclusion: 研究强调了需要更先进的推理驱动视觉生成能力，以提升AI在科学插图生成中的表现。

Abstract: Recent years have seen rapid advances in AI-driven image generation. Early
diffusion models emphasized perceptual quality, while newer multimodal models
like GPT-4o-image integrate high-level reasoning, improving semantic
understanding and structural composition. Scientific illustration generation
exemplifies this evolution: unlike general image synthesis, it demands accurate
interpretation of technical content and transformation of abstract ideas into
clear, standardized visuals. This task is significantly more
knowledge-intensive and laborious, often requiring hours of manual work and
specialized tools. Automating it in a controllable, intelligent manner would
provide substantial practical value. Yet, no benchmark currently exists to
evaluate AI on this front. To fill this gap, we introduce SridBench, the first
benchmark for scientific figure generation. It comprises 1,120 instances
curated from leading scientific papers across 13 natural and computer science
disciplines, collected via human experts and MLLMs. Each sample is evaluated
along six dimensions, including semantic fidelity and structural accuracy.
Experimental results reveal that even top-tier models like GPT-4o-image lag
behind human performance, with common issues in text/visual clarity and
scientific correctness. These findings highlight the need for more advanced
reasoning-driven visual generation capabilities.

Motivation: 解决空间边缘计算约束下地球观测图像的机械散焦问题，提升图像质量以支持实际应用。

Method: 基于Sentinel-2数据估计散焦核，并在GAN框架中训练恢复模型，无需参考图像。

Result: 在合成退化的Sentinel-2图像上，SSIM提升72.47%，PSNR提升25.00%；在IMAGIN-e任务中，NIQE和BRISQUE分别提升60.66%和48.38%。

Conclusion: 该方法在IMAGIN-e任务中成功部署，证明了其在资源受限环境下高效处理高分辨率图像的实用性。

Abstract: This work addresses mechanical defocus in Earth observation images from the
IMAGIN-e mission aboard the ISS, proposing a blind deblurring approach adapted
to space-based edge computing constraints. Leveraging Sentinel-2 data, our
method estimates the defocus kernel and trains a restoration model within a GAN
framework, effectively operating without reference images.
  On Sentinel-2 images with synthetic degradation, SSIM improved by 72.47% and
PSNR by 25.00%, confirming the model's ability to recover lost details when the
original clean image is known. On IMAGIN-e, where no reference images exist,
perceptual quality metrics indicate a substantial enhancement, with NIQE
improving by 60.66% and BRISQUE by 48.38%, validating real-world onboard
restoration. The approach is currently deployed aboard the IMAGIN-e mission,
demonstrating its practical application in an operational space environment.
  By efficiently handling high-resolution images under edge computing
constraints, the method enables applications such as water body segmentation
and contour detection while maintaining processing viability despite resource
limitations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何通过微调预训练的扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）生成360度全景图像，揭示了注意力模块中不同矩阵的作用，并提出了一种高效的方法UniPano。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究预训练扩散模型在生成全景图像时的适应机制，填补视角图像与全景图像之间的领域差距。

Method: 通过分析注意力模块中的查询、键、值和输出权重矩阵，提出UniPano框架，优化微调过程。

Result: UniPano在性能和效率上优于现有方法，减少了内存占用和训练时间。

Conclusion: UniPano为全景图像生成提供了高效且可扩展的基线方法，未来研究可基于此展开。

Abstract: Recent prosperity of text-to-image diffusion models, e.g. Stable Diffusion,
has stimulated research to adapt them to 360-degree panorama generation. Prior
work has demonstrated the feasibility of using conventional low-rank adaptation
techniques on pre-trained diffusion models to generate panoramic images.
However, the substantial domain gap between perspective and panoramic images
raises questions about the underlying mechanisms enabling this empirical
success. We hypothesize and examine that the trainable counterparts exhibit
distinct behaviors when fine-tuned on panoramic data, and such an adaptation
conceals some intrinsic mechanism to leverage the prior knowledge within the
pre-trained diffusion models. Our analysis reveals the following: 1) the query
and key matrices in the attention modules are responsible for common
information that can be shared between the panoramic and perspective domains,
thus are less relevant to panorama generation; and 2) the value and output
weight matrices specialize in adapting pre-trained knowledge to the panoramic
domain, playing a more critical role during fine-tuning for panorama
generation. We empirically verify these insights by introducing a simple
framework called UniPano, with the objective of establishing an elegant
baseline for future research. UniPano not only outperforms existing methods but
also significantly reduces memory usage and training time compared to prior
dual-branch approaches, making it scalable for end-to-end panorama generation
with higher resolution. The code will be released.

TL;DR: FaceEditTalker是一个统一框架，支持在生成高质量音频同步说话头部视频时进行可控的面部属性编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频驱动说话头部生成技术忽视了面部属性编辑的重要性，而这一能力对个性化数字形象、在线教育内容和品牌数字客服等应用至关重要。

Method: 方法包括图像特征空间编辑模块（提取语义和细节特征以灵活控制属性）和音频驱动视频生成模块（融合编辑特征与音频引导的面部标志）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在唇同步准确性、视频质量和属性可控性上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: FaceEditTalker实现了时间一致性、视觉保真度和身份保留，为面部属性编辑提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven talking head generation have achieved
impressive results in lip synchronization and emotional expression. However,
they largely overlook the crucial task of facial attribute editing. This
capability is crucial for achieving deep personalization and expanding the
range of practical applications, including user-tailored digital avatars,
engaging online education content, and brand-specific digital customer service.
In these key domains, the flexible adjustment of visual attributes-such as
hairstyle, accessories, and subtle facial features is essential for aligning
with user preferences, reflecting diverse brand identities, and adapting to
varying contextual demands. In this paper, we present FaceEditTalker, a unified
framework that enables controllable facial attribute manipulation while
generating high-quality, audio-synchronized talking head videos. Our method
consists of two key components: an image feature space editing module, which
extracts semantic and detail features and allows flexible control over
attributes like expression, hairstyle, and accessories; and an audio-driven
video generation module, which fuses these edited features with audio-guided
facial landmarks to drive a diffusion-based generator. This design ensures
temporal coherence, visual fidelity, and identity preservation across frames.
Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in lip-sync accuracy, video quality,
and attribute controllability. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用2D LVLMs的潜力解决3D任务，避免资源密集型的3D模型训练。

Method: 提出cdViews方法，包括viewSelector（选择关键视图）和viewNMS（增强视图多样性），基于2D模型进行零样本推理。

Result: 在ScanQA和SQA基准测试中达到最先进性能，验证了2D LVLMs的有效性。

Conclusion: 2D LVLMs是当前解决3D任务的最有效替代方案。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have significantly advanced numerous
fields. In this work, we explore how to harness their potential to address 3D
scene understanding tasks, using 3D question answering (3D-QA) as a
representative example. Due to the limited training data in 3D, we do not train
LVLMs but infer in a zero-shot manner. Specifically, we sample 2D views from a
3D point cloud and feed them into 2D models to answer a given question. When
the 2D model is chosen, e.g., LLAVA-OV, the quality of sampled views matters
the most. We propose cdViews, a novel approach to automatically selecting
critical and diverse Views for 3D-QA. cdViews consists of two key components:
viewSelector prioritizing critical views based on their potential to provide
answer-specific information, and viewNMS enhancing diversity by removing
redundant views based on spatial overlap. We evaluate cdViews on the
widely-used ScanQA and SQA benchmarks, demonstrating that it achieves
state-of-the-art performance in 3D-QA while relying solely on 2D models without
fine-tuning. These findings support our belief that 2D LVLMs are currently the
most effective alternative (of the resource-intensive 3D LVLMs) for addressing
3D tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在开发计算模型以模拟人类灵活的工具选择能力，填补现有模型的不足。

Method: 通过构建ToolNet数据集（含115种工具和13种属性），结合视觉编码器（ResNet或ViT）和语言模型（GPT-2、LLaMA等）提取任务所需属性。

Result: 模型在工具选择任务中达到74%的准确率，显著优于直接匹配方法（20%）和小型多模态模型（21%-58%），接近GPT-4o（73%）的性能。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一种参数高效且可解释的解决方案，模拟了人类工具认知，推动了认知科学和实际应用的发展。

Abstract: Flexible tool selection reflects a complex cognitive ability that
distinguishes humans from other species, yet computational models that capture
this ability remain underdeveloped. We developed a framework using
low-dimensional attribute representations to bridge visual tool perception and
linguistic task understanding. We constructed a comprehensive dataset (ToolNet)
containing 115 common tools labeled with 13 carefully designed attributes
spanning physical, functional, and psychological properties, paired with
natural language scenarios describing tool usage. Visual encoders (ResNet or
ViT) extract attributes from tool images while fine-tuned language models
(GPT-2, LLaMA, DeepSeek) derive required attributes from task descriptions. Our
approach achieves 74% accuracy in tool selection tasks-significantly
outperforming direct tool matching (20%) and smaller multimodal models
(21%-58%), while approaching performance of much larger models like GPT-4o
(73%) with substantially fewer parameters. Ablation studies revealed that
manipulation-related attributes (graspability, hand-relatedness, elongation)
consistently prove most critical across modalities. This work provides a
parameter-efficient, interpretable solution that mimics human-like tool
cognition, advancing both cognitive science understanding and practical
applications in tool selection tasks.

Motivation: 现有的脑到图像重建方法在细节和语义一致性上表现不足，主要原因是缺乏足够的语义信息。

Method: FgB2I方法分为三个阶段：细节增强、解码细粒度文本描述和基于文本的脑到图像重建。利用大视觉语言模型生成细粒度描述，并通过三个奖励指标指导语言模型解码fMRI信号。

Result: 细粒度文本描述可以整合到现有重建方法中，实现更精细的脑到图像重建。

Conclusion: FgB2I通过引入细粒度文本作为桥梁，显著提升了脑到图像重建的细节和语义一致性。

Abstract: Brain-to-Image reconstruction aims to recover visual stimuli perceived by
humans from brain activity. However, the reconstructed visual stimuli often
missing details and semantic inconsistencies, which may be attributed to
insufficient semantic information. To address this issue, we propose an
approach named Fine-grained Brain-to-Image reconstruction (FgB2I), which
employs fine-grained text as bridge to improve image reconstruction. FgB2I
comprises three key stages: detail enhancement, decoding fine-grained text
descriptions, and text-bridged brain-to-image reconstruction. In the
detail-enhancement stage, we leverage large vision-language models to generate
fine-grained captions for visual stimuli and experimentally validate its
importance. We propose three reward metrics (object accuracy, text-image
semantic similarity, and image-image semantic similarity) to guide the language
model in decoding fine-grained text descriptions from fMRI signals. The
fine-grained text descriptions can be integrated into existing reconstruction
methods to achieve fine-grained Brain-to-Image reconstruction.

Motivation: 现实场景中，RGB-T检测常因环境或技术问题导致模态退化，传统方法假设模态平衡，无法应对极端不平衡问题。

Method: 提出基础-辅助检测器架构，引入模态交互模块自适应加权模态，利用伪退化模拟真实不平衡训练数据。

Result: 实验显示方法有效降低缺失率55%，并在多种基线检测器上提升性能。

Conclusion: 该框架显著增强了模型在极端模态退化下的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) object detection utilizes thermal infrared (TIR) images
to complement RGB data, improving robustness in challenging conditions.
Traditional RGB-T detectors assume balanced training data, where both
modalities contribute equally. However, in real-world scenarios, modality
degradation-due to environmental factors or technical issues-can lead to
extreme modality imbalance, causing out-of-distribution (OOD) issues during
testing and disrupting model convergence during training. This paper addresses
these challenges by proposing a novel base-and-auxiliary detector architecture.
We introduce a modality interaction module to adaptively weigh modalities based
on their quality and handle imbalanced samples effectively. Additionally, we
leverage modality pseudo-degradation to simulate real-world imbalances in
training data. The base detector, trained on high-quality pairs, provides a
consistency constraint for the auxiliary detector, which receives degraded
samples. This framework enhances model robustness, ensuring reliable
performance even under severe modality degradation. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in handling extreme modality
imbalances~(decreasing the Missing Rate by 55%) and improving performance
across various baseline detectors.

Motivation: 视频DiT模型参数多、计算复杂，难以部署在边缘设备上，现有图像生成模型的量化方法不适用于视频生成任务。

Method: 提出TQE补偿量化的token和特征维度误差，TMD保持帧间时空相关性并优化每帧与整体视频上下文的关系。

Result: W3A6 Q-VDiT的场景一致性达到23.40，性能提升1.9倍。

Conclusion: Q-VDiT为视频DiT模型提供了一种高效的量化解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers (DiT) have demonstrated exceptional performance in
video generation. However, their large number of parameters and high
computational complexity limit their deployment on edge devices. Quantization
can reduce storage requirements and accelerate inference by lowering the
bit-width of model parameters. Yet, existing quantization methods for image
generation models do not generalize well to video generation tasks. We identify
two primary challenges: the loss of information during quantization and the
misalignment between optimization objectives and the unique requirements of
video generation. To address these challenges, we present Q-VDiT, a
quantization framework specifically designed for video DiT models. From the
quantization perspective, we propose the Token-aware Quantization Estimator
(TQE), which compensates for quantization errors in both the token and feature
dimensions. From the optimization perspective, we introduce Temporal
Maintenance Distillation (TMD), which preserves the spatiotemporal correlations
between frames and enables the optimization of each frame with respect to the
overall video context. Our W3A6 Q-VDiT achieves a scene consistency of 23.40,
setting a new benchmark and outperforming current state-of-the-art quantization
methods by 1.9$\times$. Code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformer（ViT）在计算需求上存在二次增长问题，限制了其实际效率。现有方法结合卷积和自注意力机制，但自注意力的复杂矩阵操作仍是瓶颈。

Method: 设计了Strip Self-Attention（SSA）和Hybrid Perception Blocks（HPBs），通过压缩空间和通道维度降低计算开销，同时保持准确性。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k、ADE20k和COCO等基准测试中，S2AFormer在GPU和非GPU环境下均表现出显著的准确性和效率提升。

Conclusion: S2AFormer在效率和效果之间取得了最佳平衡，是高效Vision Transformer的有力候选。

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has made significant advancements in computer
vision, thanks to its token mixer's sophisticated ability to capture global
dependencies between all tokens. However, the quadratic growth in computational
demands as the number of tokens increases limits its practical efficiency.
Although recent methods have combined the strengths of convolutions and
self-attention to achieve better trade-offs, the expensive pairwise token
affinity and complex matrix operations inherent in self-attention remain a
bottleneck. To address this challenge, we propose S2AFormer, an efficient
Vision Transformer architecture featuring novel Strip Self-Attention (SSA). We
design simple yet effective Hybrid Perception Blocks (HPBs) to effectively
integrate the local perception capabilities of CNNs with the global context
modeling of Transformer's attention mechanisms. A key innovation of SSA lies in
its reducing the spatial dimensions of $K$ and $V$ while compressing the
channel dimensions of $Q$ and $K$. This design significantly reduces
computational overhead while preserving accuracy, striking an optimal balance
between efficiency and effectiveness. We evaluate the robustness and efficiency
of S2AFormer through extensive experiments on multiple vision benchmarks,
including ImageNet-1k for image classification, ADE20k for semantic
segmentation, and COCO for object detection and instance segmentation. Results
demonstrate that S2AFormer achieves significant accuracy gains with superior
efficiency in both GPU and non-GPU environments, making it a strong candidate
for efficient vision Transformers.

Motivation: 理解VLMs如何跨模态关联图像和文本，以提升模型对多模态输入的理解能力。

Method: 使用合成数据集和任务，研究VLMs是否为图像和文本中的对象分配相同的Binding ID。

Result: 实验表明，VLMs为图像和文本中的对象分配了相同的Binding ID，实现了上下文关联。

Conclusion: Binding ID机制在VLMs中有效支持图像和文本的跨模态关联。

Abstract: To understand a prompt, Vision-Language models (VLMs) must perceive the
image, comprehend the text, and build associations within and across both
modalities. For instance, given an 'image of a red toy car', the model should
associate this image to phrases like 'car', 'red toy', 'red object', etc. Feng
and Steinhardt propose the Binding ID mechanism in LLMs, suggesting that the
entity and its corresponding attribute tokens share a Binding ID in the model
activations. We investigate this for image-text binding in VLMs using a
synthetic dataset and task that requires models to associate 3D objects in an
image with their descriptions in the text. Our experiments demonstrate that
VLMs assign a distinct Binding ID to an object's image tokens and its textual
references, enabling in-context association.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is one of the most fundamental tasks in image
understanding with a long history of research, and subsequently a myriad of
different approaches. Traditional methods strive to train models up from
scratch, requiring vast amounts of computational resources and training data.
In the advent of moving to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which asks
models to classify beyond learned categories, large quantities of finely
annotated data would be prohibitively expensive. Researchers have instead
turned to training-free methods where they leverage existing models made for
tasks where data is more easily acquired. Specifically, this survey will cover
the history, nuance, idea development and the state-of-the-art in training-free
open-vocabulary semantic segmentation that leverages existing multi-modal
classification models. We will first give a preliminary on the task definition
followed by an overview of popular model archetypes and then spotlight over 30
approaches split into broader research branches: purely CLIP-based, those
leveraging auxiliary visual foundation models and ones relying on generative
methods. Subsequently, we will discuss the limitations and potential problems
of current research, as well as provide some underexplored ideas for future
study. We believe this survey will serve as a good onboarding read to new
researchers and spark increased interest in the area.

Method: L&M策略整合放射科医生的注视点（Look）和标注框（Mark），利用上下文学习提升性能，无需重新训练。

Result: L&M显著提升性能，如CXR-LLaVA指标提升1.2%，LLaVA-Med提升9.2%，并减少临床错误。

Conclusion: L&M为AI辅助放射学提供了一种可扩展的高效解决方案，尤其适用于资源匮乏的临床环境。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) have
significantly enhanced the automation of medical image analysis, particularly
in generating radiology reports from chest X-rays (CXR). However, these models
still suffer from hallucinations and clinically significant errors, limiting
their reliability in real-world applications. In this study, we propose Look &
Mark (L&M), a novel grounding fixation strategy that integrates radiologist eye
fixations (Look) and bounding box annotations (Mark) into the LLM prompting
framework. Unlike conventional fine-tuning, L&M leverages in-context learning
to achieve substantial performance gains without retraining. When evaluated
across multiple domain-specific and general-purpose models, L&M demonstrates
significant gains, including a 1.2% improvement in overall metrics (A.AVG) for
CXR-LLaVA compared to baseline prompting and a remarkable 9.2% boost for
LLaVA-Med. General-purpose models also benefit from L&M combined with
in-context learning, with LLaVA-OV achieving an 87.3% clinical average
performance (C.AVG)-the highest among all models, even surpassing those
explicitly trained for CXR report generation. Expert evaluations further
confirm that L&M reduces clinically significant errors (by 0.43 average errors
per report), such as false predictions and omissions, enhancing both accuracy
and reliability. These findings highlight L&M's potential as a scalable and
efficient solution for AI-assisted radiology, paving the way for improved
diagnostic workflows in low-resource clinical settings.

Motivation: 尽管Hadamard乘积在理论上具有增强网络表示能力和维度压缩的潜力，但其实际应用尚未充分开发。

Method: 分析了Hadamard乘积的优势，提出自适应跨通道Hadamard乘积模块（ACH），并构建了Hadaptive-Net网络。

Result: 实验表明，Hadaptive-Net在推理速度和精度之间取得了前所未有的平衡。

Conclusion: ACH模块和Hadaptive-Net为Hadamard乘积的实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed the immense potential of Hadamard product in
enhancing network representational capacity and dimensional compression.
However, despite its theoretical promise, this technique has not been
systematically explored or effectively applied in practice, leaving its full
capabilities underdeveloped. In this work, we first analyze and identify the
advantages of Hadamard product over standard convolutional operations in
cross-channel interaction and channel expansion. Building upon these insights,
we propose a computationally efficient module: Adaptive Cross-Hadamard (ACH),
which leverages adaptive cross-channel Hadamard products for high-dimensional
channel expansion. Furthermore, we introduce Hadaptive-Net (Hadamard Adaptive
Network), a lightweight network backbone for visual tasks, which is
demonstrated through experiments that it achieves an unprecedented balance
between inference speed and accuracy through our proposed module.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GoMatching++是一种高效的方法，将图像文本检测器转化为视频文本检测器，通过轻量级跟踪器和领域适应技术提升性能，并在多个基准测试中创下新记录。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频文本检测方法性能不足，主要因为识别能力有限，即使经过端到端训练。

Method: 冻结图像文本检测器，引入轻量级可训练跟踪器，包括重评分机制和LST-Matcher。

Result: 在ICDAR15-video、DSText和BOVText等基准测试中表现优异，并显著降低训练成本。

Conclusion: GoMatching++和ArTVideo基准将推动视频文本检测领域的发展。

Abstract: Video text spotting (VTS) extends image text spotting (ITS) by adding text
tracking, significantly increasing task complexity. Despite progress in VTS,
existing methods still fall short of the performance seen in ITS. This paper
identifies a key limitation in current video text spotters: limited recognition
capability, even after extensive end-to-end training. To address this, we
propose GoMatching++, a parameter- and data-efficient method that transforms an
off-the-shelf image text spotter into a video specialist. The core idea lies in
freezing the image text spotter and introducing a lightweight, trainable
tracker, which can be optimized efficiently with minimal training data. Our
approach includes two key components: (1) a rescoring mechanism to bridge the
domain gap between image and video data, and (2) the LST-Matcher, which
enhances the frozen image text spotter's ability to handle video text. We
explore various architectures for LST-Matcher to ensure efficiency in both
parameters and training data. As a result, GoMatching++ sets new performance
records on challenging benchmarks such as ICDAR15-video, DSText, and BOVText,
while significantly reducing training costs. To address the lack of curved text
datasets in VTS, we introduce ArTVideo, a new benchmark featuring over 30%
curved text with detailed annotations. We also provide a comprehensive
statistical analysis and experimental results for ArTVideo. We believe that
GoMatching++ and the ArTVideo benchmark will drive future advancements in video
text spotting. The source code, models and dataset are publicly available at

TL;DR: GradTrack利用医生的注视轨迹（包括注视点、持续时间和时间顺序）提升弱监督语义分割性能，显著优于现有方法，并缩小与全监督模型的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像中弱监督语义分割（WSSS）难以有效利用稀疏标注，现有基于注视的方法未充分利用注视数据的丰富信息。

Method: GradTrack包含注视轨迹图生成和轨迹注意力两个组件，通过多级注视监督在解码过程中逐步优化特征。

Result: 在Kvasir-SEG和NCI-ISBI数据集上，GradTrack的Dice分数分别提升3.21%和2.61%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GradTrack通过充分利用注视数据，显著提升WSSS性能，并接近全监督模型的表现。

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) in medical imaging struggles
with effectively using sparse annotations. One promising direction for WSSS
leverages gaze annotations, captured via eye trackers that record regions of
interest during diagnostic procedures. However, existing gaze-based methods,
such as GazeMedSeg, do not fully exploit the rich information embedded in gaze
data. In this paper, we propose GradTrack, a framework that utilizes
physicians' gaze track, including fixation points, durations, and temporal
order, to enhance WSSS performance. GradTrack comprises two key components:
Gaze Track Map Generation and Track Attention, which collaboratively enable
progressive feature refinement through multi-level gaze supervision during the
decoding process. Experiments on the Kvasir-SEG and NCI-ISBI datasets
demonstrate that GradTrack consistently outperforms existing gaze-based
methods, achieving Dice score improvements of 3.21\% and 2.61\%, respectively.
Moreover, GradTrack significantly narrows the performance gap with fully
supervised models such as nnUNet.

TL;DR: StateSpaceDiffuser结合扩散模型和状态空间模型（Mamba），解决了现有世界模型因缺乏长期环境状态而导致的视觉一致性崩溃问题，显著提升了长期任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在长上下文任务中因缺乏持久环境状态而快速失去视觉一致性，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 通过集成状态空间模型的序列表示，设计StateSpaceDiffuser，恢复长期记忆同时保持扩散模型的高保真合成能力。

Result: 在2D迷宫导航和复杂3D环境中，StateSpaceDiffuser显著优于纯扩散模型基线，保持视觉一致性长达更多步骤。

Conclusion: 将状态空间表示引入扩散模型能有效兼顾视觉细节和长期记忆，为世界模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: World models have recently become promising tools for predicting realistic
visuals based on actions in complex environments. However, their reliance on a
short sequence of observations causes them to quickly lose track of context. As
a result, visual consistency breaks down after just a few steps, and generated
scenes no longer reflect information seen earlier. This limitation of the
state-of-the-art diffusion-based world models comes from their lack of a
lasting environment state. To address this problem, we introduce
StateSpaceDiffuser, where a diffusion model is enabled to perform on
long-context tasks by integrating a sequence representation from a state-space
model (Mamba), representing the entire interaction history. This design
restores long-term memory without sacrificing the high-fidelity synthesis of
diffusion models. To rigorously measure temporal consistency, we develop an
evaluation protocol that probes a model's ability to reinstantiate seen content
in extended rollouts. Comprehensive experiments show that StateSpaceDiffuser
significantly outperforms a strong diffusion-only baseline, maintaining a
coherent visual context for an order of magnitude more steps. It delivers
consistent views in both a 2D maze navigation and a complex 3D environment.
These results establish that bringing state-space representations into
diffusion models is highly effective in demonstrating both visual details and
long-term memory.

Motivation: 珊瑚礁生态监测面临人工分析效率低和复杂水下场景分割精度不足的问题，亟需智能解决方案。

Method: 采用基于MLLM的YH-OSI系统，结合目标检测（mAP@0.5=0.78）和语义分割模块，生成空间先验框并完成像素级分割，再通过多模态模型实现分类和生态指标提取。

Result: 系统在低光和密集遮挡场景下表现优异，分类准确率达88%，并支持生态指标自动化提取。

Conclusion: YH-OSI系统为珊瑚礁监测提供了高效自动化方案，未来可扩展至水下机器人，实现全流程自动化监测。

Abstract: Coral reefs, crucial for sustaining marine biodiversity and ecological
processes (e.g., nutrient cycling, habitat provision), face escalating threats,
underscoring the need for efficient monitoring. Coral reef ecological
monitoring faces dual challenges of low efficiency in manual analysis and
insufficient segmentation accuracy in complex underwater scenarios. This study
develops the YH-OSI system, establishing an intelligent framework centered on
the Multimodal Large Model (MLLM) for "object detection-semantic
segmentation-prior input". The system uses the object detection module
(mAP@0.5=0.78) to generate spatial prior boxes for coral instances, driving the
segment module to complete pixel-level segmentation in low-light and densely
occluded scenarios. The segmentation masks and finetuned classification
instructions are fed into the Qwen2-VL-based multimodal model as prior inputs,
achieving a genus-level classification accuracy of 88% and simultaneously
extracting core ecological metrics. Meanwhile, the system retains the
scalability of the multimodal model through standardized interfaces, laying a
foundation for future integration into multimodal agent-based underwater robots
and supporting the full-process automation of "image acquisition-prior
generation-real-time analysis."

TL;DR: HeadCLIP是一种零样本异常检测方法，通过自适应调整文本和图像编码器，结合可学习提示和动态头权重，显著提升了工业与医疗领域的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本异常检测方法在领域适应上存在不足，HeadCLIP旨在通过全面适应文本和图像编码器来解决这一问题。

Method: HeadCLIP采用可学习提示调整文本编码器，动态头权重优化图像编码器，并引入联合异常评分以利用像素级信息。

Result: 在工业和医疗领域，HeadCLIP在像素和图像级别的异常检测得分上分别提升了4.9%和3.0%（工业）及3.2%和3.1%（医疗）。

Conclusion: HeadCLIP通过全面领域适应显著提升了零样本异常检测性能，适用于多种实际场景。

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) in images is an approach that can detect
anomalies without access to normal samples, which can be beneficial in various
realistic scenarios where model training is not possible. However, existing
ZSAD research has shown limitations by either not considering domain adaptation
of general-purpose backbone models to anomaly detection domains or by
implementing only partial adaptation to some model components. In this paper,
we propose HeadCLIP to overcome these limitations by effectively adapting both
text and image encoders to the domain. HeadCLIP generalizes the concepts of
normality and abnormality through learnable prompts in the text encoder, and
introduces learnable head weights to the image encoder to dynamically adjust
the features held by each attention head according to domain characteristics.
Additionally, we maximize the effect of domain adaptation by introducing a
joint anomaly score that utilizes domain-adapted pixel-level information for
image-level anomaly detection. Experimental results using multiple real
datasets in both industrial and medical domains show that HeadCLIP outperforms
existing ZSAD techniques at both pixel and image levels. In the industrial
domain, improvements of up to 4.9%p in pixel-level mean anomaly detection score
(mAD) and up to 3.0%p in image-level mAD were achieved, with similar
improvements (3.2%p, 3.1%p) in the medical domain.

TL;DR: HDGS通过分层深度引导的框架和CPCL损失，显著提升了稀疏视图下的新视角合成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图条件下，现有方法（如NeRF和3DGS）因几何线索不足导致重建质量下降，模糊和结构伪影问题突出。

Method: 提出HDGS框架，采用分层深度监督和CPCL损失，从粗到细逐步优化几何结构。

Result: 在LLFF和DTU基准测试中，HDGS在稀疏视图下达到最优性能，同时保持高效渲染。

Conclusion: HDGS通过多尺度深度一致性显著提升了稀疏视图下的结构保真度和渲染质量。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision that aims to
reconstruct realistic images from a set of posed input views. However,
reconstruction quality degrades significantly under sparse-view conditions due
to limited geometric cues. Existing methods, such as Neural Radiance Fields
(NeRF) and the more recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), often suffer from
blurred details and structural artifacts when trained with insufficient views.
Recent works have identified the quality of rendered depth as a key factor in
mitigating these artifacts, as it directly affects geometric accuracy and view
consistency. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing
Hierarchical Depth-Guided Splatting (HDGS), a depth supervision framework that
progressively refines geometry from coarse to fine levels. Central to HDGS is a
novel Cascade Pearson Correlation Loss (CPCL), which aligns rendered and
estimated monocular depths across multiple spatial scales. By enforcing
multi-scale depth consistency, our method substantially improves structural
fidelity in sparse-view scenarios. Extensive experiments on the LLFF and DTU
benchmarks demonstrate that HDGS achieves state-of-the-art performance under
sparse-view settings while maintaining efficient and high-quality rendering

*Junyu Fan,Chuanlin Liao,Yi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一域自适应图像修复（UDAIR）框架，通过域适应策略和对比学习机制，解决了多退化模式图像修复中的域差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有全合一图像修复（AiOIR）方法在真实场景中性能下降，主要由于训练数据与测试数据的分布差异导致退化识别能力不足。

Method: 设计了代码本学习离散嵌入表示退化模式，采用跨样本对比学习捕获共享特征，并提出域适应策略动态对齐源域和目标域的嵌入。

Result: 在10个开源数据集上，UDAIR实现了最先进的性能，特征聚类验证了未知条件下的退化识别能力。

Conclusion: UDAIR通过域适应和对比学习，显著提升了AiOIR任务在真实场景中的泛化能力。

Abstract: As a fundamental imaging task, All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) aims to
achieve image restoration caused by multiple degradation patterns via a single
model with unified parameters. Although existing AiOIR approaches obtain
promising performance in closed and controlled scenarios, they still suffered
from considerable performance reduction in real-world scenarios since the gap
of data distributions between the training samples (source domain) and
real-world test samples (target domain) can lead inferior degradation awareness
ability. To address this issue, a Unified Domain-Adaptive Image Restoration
(UDAIR) framework is proposed to effectively achieve AiOIR by leveraging the
learned knowledge from source domain to target domain. To improve the
degradation identification, a codebook is designed to learn a group of discrete
embeddings to denote the degradation patterns, and the cross-sample contrastive
learning mechanism is further proposed to capture shared features from
different samples of certain degradation. To bridge the data gap, a domain
adaptation strategy is proposed to build the feature projection between the
source and target domains by dynamically aligning their codebook embeddings,
and a correlation alignment-based test-time adaptation mechanism is designed to
fine-tune the alignment discrepancies by tightening the degradation embeddings
to the corresponding cluster center in the source domain. Experimental results
on 10 open-source datasets demonstrate that UDAIR achieves new state-of-the-art
performance for the AiOIR task. Most importantly, the feature cluster validate
the degradation identification under unknown conditions, and qualitative
comparisons showcase robust generalization to real-world scenarios.

Method: 通过合成数据集生成模拟绿色缺陷，并设计加权损失函数用于ChaIR方法以修复颜色失衡。

Result: 该方法能高效修复照片，减少时间需求，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为视觉艺术修复提供了一种自动化且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The preservation of early visual arts, particularly color photographs, is
challenged by deterioration caused by aging and improper storage, leading to
issues like blurring, scratches, color bleeding, and fading defects. In this
paper, we present the first approach for the automatic removal of greening
color defects in digitized autochrome photographs. Our main contributions
include a method based on synthetic dataset generation and the use of
generative AI with a carefully designed loss function for the restoration of
visual arts. To address the lack of suitable training datasets for analyzing
greening defects in damaged autochromes, we introduce a novel approach for
accurately simulating such defects in synthetic data. We also propose a
modified weighted loss function for the ChaIR method to account for color
imbalances between defected and non-defected areas. While existing methods
struggle with accurately reproducing original colors and may require
significant manual effort, our method allows for efficient restoration with
reduced time requirements.

Result: 实验表明ReCAD显著优于现有MLLMs，在设计应用中潜力巨大。

Conclusion: ReCAD框架有效解决了CAD程序审核问题，提升了设计效率。

Abstract: Computer-aided design (CAD) is crucial in prototyping 3D objects through
geometric instructions (i.e., CAD programs). In practical design workflows,
designers often engage in time-consuming reviews and refinements of these
prototypes by comparing them with reference images. To bridge this gap, we
introduce the CAD review task to automatically detect and correct potential
errors, ensuring consistency between the constructed 3D objects and reference
images. However, recent advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
struggle to recognize multiple geometric components and perform spatial
geometric operations within the CAD program, leading to inaccurate reviews. In
this paper, we propose the CAD program repairer (ReCAD) framework to
effectively detect program errors and provide helpful feedback on error
correction. Additionally, we create a dataset, CADReview, consisting of over
20K program-image pairs, with diverse errors for the CAD review task. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our ReCAD significantly outperforms existing
MLLMs, which shows great potential in design applications.

TL;DR: IKIWISI是一种交互式视觉模式生成器，用于评估无真实标签时的视觉语言模型，通过热图可视化模型输出，并利用人类模式识别能力评估模型可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估方法在缺乏真实标签时难以评估视觉语言模型的可靠性，IKIWISI旨在通过可视化工具填补这一空白。

Method: IKIWISI将模型输出转化为二元热图（绿色表示对象存在，红色表示对象不存在），并引入“间谍对象”检测模型幻觉。

Result: 15名参与者认为IKIWISI易用，其评估结果与客观指标一致，且仅需少量热图单元即可得出结论。

Conclusion: IKIWISI不仅补充了传统评估方法，还揭示了改进视觉语言系统与人类感知对齐的机会。

Abstract: We present IKIWISI ("I Know It When I See It"), an interactive visual pattern
generator for assessing vision-language models in video object recognition when
ground truth is unavailable. IKIWISI transforms model outputs into a binary
heatmap where green cells indicate object presence and red cells indicate
object absence. This visualization leverages humans' innate pattern recognition
abilities to evaluate model reliability. IKIWISI introduces "spy objects":
adversarial instances users know are absent, to discern models hallucinating on
nonexistent items. The tool functions as a cognitive audit mechanism, surfacing
mismatches between human and machine perception by visualizing where models
diverge from human understanding.
  Our study with 15 participants found that users considered IKIWISI easy to
use, made assessments that correlated with objective metrics when available,
and reached informed conclusions by examining only a small fraction of heatmap
cells. This approach not only complements traditional evaluation methods
through visual assessment of model behavior with custom object sets, but also
reveals opportunities for improving alignment between human perception and
machine understanding in vision-language systems.

Result: 在合成植物上验证，该方法在重建、分割和骨架化任务上达到与现有技术相当的效果。

Conclusion: 该方法为植物3D分析提供了统一的参数化表示框架，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Reconstructing faithfully the 3D architecture of plants from unstructured
observations is a challenging task. Plants frequently contain numerous organs,
organized in branching systems in more or less complex spatial networks,
leading to specific computational issues due to self-occlusion or spatial
proximity between organs. Existing works either consider inverse modeling where
the aim is to recover the procedural rules that allow to simulate virtual
plants, or focus on specific tasks such as segmentation or skeletonization. We
propose a unified approach that, given a 3D scan of a plant, allows to infer a
parameterized representation of the plant. This representation describes the
plant's branching structure, contains parametric information for each plant
organ, and can therefore be used directly in a variety of tasks. In this
data-driven approach, we train a recursive neural network with virtual plants
generated using an L-systems-based procedural model. After training, the
network allows to infer a parametric tree-like representation based on an input
3D point cloud. Our method is applicable to any plant that can be represented
as binary axial tree. We evaluate our approach on Chenopodium Album plants,
using experiments on synthetic plants to show that our unified framework allows
for different tasks including reconstruction, segmentation and skeletonization,
while achieving results on-par with state-of-the-art for each task.

Result: 有效训练轮次减少至12.4%，准确率提升高达4.82%。

Conclusion: 该方法简单易用，适用于标准训练流程，具有广泛应用的潜力。

Abstract: The success of the machine learning field has reliably depended on training
on large datasets. While effective, this trend comes at an extraordinary cost.
This is due to two deeply intertwined factors: the size of models and the size
of datasets. While promising research efforts focus on reducing the size of
models, the other half of the equation remains fairly mysterious. Indeed, it is
surprising that the standard approach to training remains to iterate over and
over, uniformly sampling the training dataset. In this paper we explore a
series of alternative training paradigms that leverage insights from
hard-data-mining and dropout, simple enough to implement and use that can
become the new training standard. The proposed Progressive Data Dropout reduces
the number of effective epochs to as little as 12.4% of the baseline. This
savings actually do not come at any cost for accuracy. Surprisingly, the
proposed method improves accuracy by up to 4.82%. Our approach requires no
changes to model architecture or optimizer, and can be applied across standard
training pipelines, thus posing an excellent opportunity for wide adoption.

Abstract: Imaging system design is a complex, time-consuming, and largely manual
process; LiDAR design, ubiquitous in mobile devices, autonomous vehicles, and
aerial imaging platforms, adds further complexity through unique spatial and
temporal sampling requirements. In this work, we propose a framework for
automated, task-driven LiDAR system design under arbitrary constraints. To
achieve this, we represent LiDAR configurations in a continuous six-dimensional
design space and learn task-specific implicit densities in this space via
flow-based generative modeling. We then synthesize new LiDAR systems by
modeling sensors as parametric distributions in 6D space and fitting these
distributions to our learned implicit density using expectation-maximization,
enabling efficient, constraint-aware LiDAR system design. We validate our
method on diverse tasks in 3D vision, enabling automated LiDAR system design
across real-world-inspired applications in face scanning, robotic tracking, and
object detection.

Motivation: 当前车辆检测模型在中东地区表现不佳，主要由于现有数据集存在地理偏差，缺乏中东地区的代表性数据。

Method: 通过收集和标注中东地区的高分辨率卫星图像，构建VME数据集；同时整合多源数据，建立CDSI基准数据集。

Result: 实验表明，VME显著提升了中东地区的检测准确率，CDSI则提升了全球车辆检测性能。

Conclusion: VME和CDSI填补了地理偏差的空白，为车辆检测提供了更全面的数据支持。

Abstract: Detecting vehicles in satellite images is crucial for traffic management,
urban planning, and disaster response. However, current models struggle with
real-world diversity, particularly across different regions. This challenge is
amplified by geographic bias in existing datasets, which often focus on
specific areas and overlook regions like the Middle East. To address this gap,
we present the Vehicles in the Middle East (VME) dataset, designed explicitly
for vehicle detection in high-resolution satellite images from Middle Eastern
countries. Sourced from Maxar, the VME dataset spans 54 cities across 12
countries, comprising over 4,000 image tiles and more than 100,000 vehicles,
annotated using both manual and semi-automated methods. Additionally, we
introduce the largest benchmark dataset for Car Detection in Satellite Imagery
(CDSI), combining images from multiple sources to enhance global car detection.
Our experiments demonstrate that models trained on existing datasets perform
poorly on Middle Eastern images, while the VME dataset significantly improves
detection accuracy in this region. Moreover, state-of-the-art models trained on
CDSI achieve substantial improvements in global car detection.

*Kewen Chen,Xiaobin Hu,Wenqi Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新框架，通过解耦身份相关与无关特征及动态特征融合，提升文本到图像生成的质量和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法难以区分输入图像中身份相关与无关信息，导致过拟合或身份丢失。

Method: 框架包含隐式-显式前景-背景解耦模块（IEDM）和基于专家混合（MoE）的特征融合模块（FFM），辅以三种损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提高了生成质量、场景适应性和输出多样性。

Conclusion: 新框架有效解决了身份信息解耦问题，提升了文本到图像生成的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image generation models have led to a
surge in subject-driven text-to-image generation, which aims to produce
customized images that align with textual descriptions while preserving the
identity of specific subjects. Despite significant progress, current methods
struggle to disentangle identity-relevant information from identity-irrelevant
details in the input images, resulting in overfitting or failure to maintain
subject identity. In this work, we propose a novel framework that improves the
separation of identity-related and identity-unrelated features and introduces
an innovative feature fusion mechanism to improve the quality and text
alignment of generated images. Our framework consists of two key components: an
Implicit-Explicit foreground-background Decoupling Module (IEDM) and a Feature
Fusion Module (FFM) based on a Mixture of Experts (MoE). IEDM combines
learnable adapters for implicit decoupling at the feature level with inpainting
techniques for explicit foreground-background separation at the image level.
FFM dynamically integrates identity-irrelevant features with identity-related
features, enabling refined feature representations even in cases of incomplete
decoupling. In addition, we introduce three complementary loss functions to
guide the decoupling process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method in enhancing image generation quality,
improving flexibility in scene adaptation, and increasing the diversity of
generated outputs across various textual descriptions.

*Jaehyun Choi,Gyojin Han,Dong-Jae Lee,Sunghyun Baek,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多域数据集压缩方法（MDDC），通过域感知模块（DAM）嵌入域相关特征，提升单域和多域场景下的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代数据集通常是多域异构的，现有数据集压缩方法未充分考虑这一特性，导致泛化能力不足。

Method: 引入域感知模块（DAM），通过可学习空间掩码嵌入域特征，并使用基于频率的伪域标签。

Result: DAM在域内、域外和跨架构性能上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MDDC通过DAM有效提升了数据集压缩的泛化能力，适用于多域场景。

Abstract: Dataset Condensation (DC) has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate the
computational and storage burdens associated with training deep learning
models. However, existing DC methods largely overlook the multi-domain nature
of modern datasets, which are increasingly composed of heterogeneous images
spanning multiple domains. In this paper, we extend DC and introduce
Multi-Domain Dataset Condensation (MDDC), which aims to condense data that
generalizes across both single-domain and multi-domain settings. To this end,
we propose the Domain-Aware Module (DAM), a training-time module that embeds
domain-related features into each synthetic image via learnable spatial masks.
As explicit domain labels are mostly unavailable in real-world datasets, we
employ frequency-based pseudo-domain labeling, which leverages low-frequency
amplitude statistics. DAM is only active during the condensation process, thus
preserving the same images per class (IPC) with prior methods. Experiments show
that DAM consistently improves in-domain, out-of-domain, and cross-architecture
performance over baseline dataset condensation methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PacTure是一个新框架，通过无纹理3D网格、文本描述和可选图像提示生成基于物理的渲染（PBR）材质纹理。它解决了现有方法在全局一致性和分辨率上的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有2D生成方法在纹理生成中存在全局不一致性和低分辨率问题，PacTure旨在通过新技术解决这些问题。

Method: 引入视图打包技术，将多视图映射问题转化为2D矩形装箱问题，提高分辨率；结合多域生成框架，优化推理效率。

Result: 实验表明，PacTure在生成PBR纹理的质量和训练/推理效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PacTure通过创新技术显著提升了纹理生成的全局一致性和效率，为3D渲染提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: We present PacTure, a novel framework for generating physically-based
rendering (PBR) material textures from an untextured 3D mesh, a text
description, and an optional image prompt. Early 2D generation-based texturing
approaches generate textures sequentially from different views, resulting in
long inference times and globally inconsistent textures. More recent approaches
adopt multi-view generation with cross-view attention to enhance global
consistency, which, however, limits the resolution for each view. In response
to these weaknesses, we first introduce view packing, a novel technique that
significantly increases the effective resolution for each view during
multi-view generation without imposing additional inference cost, by
formulating the arrangement of multi-view maps as a 2D rectangle bin packing
problem. In contrast to UV mapping, it preserves the spatial proximity
essential for image generation and maintains full compatibility with current 2D
generative models. To further reduce the inference cost, we enable fine-grained
control and multi-domain generation within the next-scale prediction
autoregressive framework to create an efficient multi-view multi-domain
generative backbone. Extensive experiments show that PacTure outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both quality of generated PBR textures and
efficiency in training and inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在单图像任务中表现优异，但在多图像理解中因跨模态不对齐导致幻觉问题，现有方法未能全面建模上下文。

Method: 提出CcDPO框架，包括上下文级优化（全局序列偏好）和细节级优化（区域目标视觉提示），并构建MultiScope-42k数据集支持优化。

Result: CcDPO显著减少幻觉现象，并在单图像和多图像任务中表现一致提升。

Conclusion: CcDPO通过多级优化有效解决了多图像任务中的幻觉问题，为跨模态对齐提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at single-image tasks but
struggle with multi-image understanding due to cross-modal misalignment,
leading to hallucinations (context omission, conflation, and
misinterpretation). Existing methods using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
constrain optimization to a solitary image reference within the input sequence,
neglecting holistic context modeling. We propose Context-to-Cue Direct
Preference Optimization (CcDPO), a multi-level preference optimization
framework that enhances per-image perception in multi-image settings by zooming
into visual clues -- from sequential context to local details. It features: (i)
Context-Level Optimization : Re-evaluates cognitive biases underlying MLLMs'
multi-image context comprehension and integrates a spectrum of low-cost global
sequence preferences for bias mitigation. (ii) Needle-Level Optimization :
Directs attention to fine-grained visual details through region-targeted visual
prompts and multimodal preference supervision. To support scalable
optimization, we also construct MultiScope-42k, an automatically generated
dataset with high-quality multi-level preference pairs. Experiments show that
CcDPO significantly reduces hallucinations and yields consistent performance
gains across general single- and multi-image tasks.

TL;DR: SRRL是一种自反思强化学习算法，用于扩散模型，通过生成轨迹中的反思和迭代实现逻辑图像的推理生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成方法在逻辑中心任务中表现不佳，受CoT和RL在LLMs中的成功启发，提出SRRL。

Method: SRRL将整个去噪轨迹视为多轮反思步骤，引入条件引导的前向过程，实现CoT步骤间的反思迭代。

Result: 实验表明SRRL在逻辑图像生成任务中表现优异，甚至优于GPT-4o。

Conclusion: SRRL首次将CoT推理引入图像生成任务，为遵循物理规律和非传统现象的生成提供了新方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently demonstrated exceptional performance in image
generation task. However, existing image generation methods still significantly
suffer from the dilemma of image reasoning, especially in logic-centered image
generation tasks. Inspired by the success of Chain of Thought (CoT) and
Reinforcement Learning (RL) in LLMs, we propose SRRL, a self-reflective RL
algorithm for diffusion models to achieve reasoning generation of logical
images by performing reflection and iteration across generation trajectories.
The intermediate samples in the denoising process carry noise, making accurate
reward evaluation difficult. To address this challenge, SRRL treats the entire
denoising trajectory as a CoT step with multi-round reflective denoising
process and introduces condition guided forward process, which allows for
reflective iteration between CoT steps. Through SRRL-based iterative diffusion
training, we introduce image reasoning through CoT into generation tasks
adhering to physical laws and unconventional physical phenomena for the first
time. Notably, experimental results of case study exhibit that the superior
performance of our SRRL algorithm even compared with GPT-4o. The project page

Motivation: 增量学习在深度学习中潜力巨大，但面临灾难性遗忘和数据量增长的挑战，尤其是回放方法的数据扩展问题。

Method: 设计了基于多模态潜在空间的新型增量生成模型，并引入正交性准则以减少VAE的灾难性遗忘。方法包括静态和动态VAE变体，参数数量可控。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在内存占用上比相关研究节省至少一个数量级，同时达到SOTA准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法为增量学习提供了一种高效且内存友好的解决方案，显著减少了数据扩展和遗忘问题。

Abstract: Continual or incremental learning holds tremendous potential in deep learning
with different challenges including catastrophic forgetting. The advent of
powerful foundation and generative models has propelled this paradigm even
further, making it one of the most viable solution to train these models.
However, one of the persisting issues lies in the increasing volume of data
particularly with replay-based methods. This growth introduces challenges with
scalability since continuously expanding data becomes increasingly demanding as
the number of tasks grows. In this paper, we attenuate this issue by devising a
novel replay-free incremental learning model based on Variational Autoencoders
(VAEs). The main contribution of this work includes (i) a novel incremental
generative modelling, built upon a well designed multi-modal latent space, and
also (ii) an orthogonality criterion that mitigates catastrophic forgetting of
the learned VAEs. The proposed method considers two variants of these VAEs:
static and dynamic with no (or at most a controlled) growth in the number of
parameters. Extensive experiments show that our method is (at least) an order
of magnitude more ``memory-frugal'' compared to the closely related works while
achieving SOTA accuracy scores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在保持3D几何一致性或处理遮挡时存在缺陷，影响自动驾驶的安全评估。

Method: 从输入帧提取3D表示，基于用户指定的轨迹生成2D渲染，并通过动态编辑模块增强渲染效果。

Result: 在动作准确性和3D空间感知方面显著优于现有模型，支持新轨迹泛化和交互式场景编辑。

Conclusion: GeoDrive为自动驾驶提供了更真实、适应性强且可靠的场景建模，提升了安全性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in world models have revolutionized dynamic environment
simulation, allowing systems to foresee future states and assess potential
actions. In autonomous driving, these capabilities help vehicles anticipate the
behavior of other road users, perform risk-aware planning, accelerate training
in simulation, and adapt to novel scenarios, thereby enhancing safety and
reliability. Current approaches exhibit deficiencies in maintaining robust 3D
geometric consistency or accumulating artifacts during occlusion handling, both
critical for reliable safety assessment in autonomous navigation tasks. To
address this, we introduce GeoDrive, which explicitly integrates robust 3D
geometry conditions into driving world models to enhance spatial understanding
and action controllability. Specifically, we first extract a 3D representation
from the input frame and then obtain its 2D rendering based on the
user-specified ego-car trajectory. To enable dynamic modeling, we propose a
dynamic editing module during training to enhance the renderings by editing the
positions of the vehicles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing models in both action accuracy and 3D
spatial awareness, leading to more realistic, adaptable, and reliable scene
modeling for safer autonomous driving. Additionally, our model can generalize
to novel trajectories and offers interactive scene editing capabilities, such
as object editing and object trajectory control.

Motivation: 雷达高度数据的稀疏性和不确定性使得在线自动标定成为挑战，需解决视角融合和跨模态匹配问题。

Method: 采用双视角表示（前视图和鸟瞰图），选择性融合机制减少高度不确定性影响，多模态交叉注意力机制实现跨模态匹配，噪声抵抗匹配器增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上测试，性能显著优于现有雷达-相机和LiDAR-相机标定方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为雷达-相机自动标定设立了新基准，代码已开源。

Abstract: This paper presents a groundbreaking approach - the first online automatic
geometric calibration method for radar and camera systems. Given the
significant data sparsity and measurement uncertainty in radar height data,
achieving automatic calibration during system operation has long been a
challenge. To address the sparsity issue, we propose a Dual-Perspective
representation that gathers features from both frontal and bird's-eye views.
The frontal view contains rich but sensitive height information, whereas the
bird's-eye view provides robust features against height uncertainty. We thereby
propose a novel Selective Fusion Mechanism to identify and fuse reliable
features from both perspectives, reducing the effect of height uncertainty.
Moreover, for each view, we incorporate a Multi-Modal Cross-Attention Mechanism
to explicitly find location correspondences through cross-modal matching.
During the training phase, we also design a Noise-Resistant Matcher to provide
better supervision and enhance the robustness of the matching mechanism against
sparsity and height uncertainty. Our experimental results, tested on the
nuScenes dataset, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
previous radar-camera auto-calibration methods, as well as existing
state-of-the-art LiDAR-camera calibration techniques, establishing a new
benchmark for future research. The code is available at

Conclusion: SeeGround展示了在挑战性条件下的强泛化能力，为3D视觉定位提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) seeks to locate target objects in 3D scenes using
natural language descriptions, enabling downstream applications such as
augmented reality and robotics. Existing approaches typically rely on labeled
3D data and predefined categories, limiting scalability to open-world settings.
We present SeeGround, a zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages 2D
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to bypass the need for 3D-specific training. To
bridge the modality gap, we introduce a hybrid input format that pairs
query-aligned rendered views with spatially enriched textual descriptions. Our
framework incorporates two core components: a Perspective Adaptation Module
that dynamically selects optimal viewpoints based on the query, and a Fusion
Alignment Module that integrates visual and spatial signals to enhance
localization precision. Extensive evaluations on ScanRefer and Nr3D confirm
that SeeGround achieves substantial improvements over existing zero-shot
baselines -- outperforming them by 7.7% and 7.1%, respectively -- and even
rivals fully supervised alternatives, demonstrating strong generalization under
challenging conditions.

Abstract: Alzheimer's detection efforts aim to develop accurate models for early

datasets suffer heavily from class imbalance, variations in imaging protocols,
and limited dataset diversity, which hinder model generalization. To overcome
these challenges, this study focuses on single-domain generalization by
extending the well-known mixup method. The key idea is to compute the distance
transform of MRI scans, separate them spatially into multiple layers and then
combine layers stemming from distinct samples to produce augmented images. The
proposed approach generates diverse data while preserving the brain's
structure. Experimental results show generalization performance improvement
across both ADNI and AIBL datasets.

Motivation: 传统NeRF技术主要用于光学信号处理，而多路径信号（如RF/音频）因包含环境反射信息，具有潜在的环境推断能力。论文旨在探索NeRF是否可以从多路径信号中学习环境信息。

Method: 通过重新设计NeRF，使其能够从多路径信号（如稀疏WiFi测量数据）中学习，并推断环境信息。具体应用为从室内WiFi测量数据重建平面图。

Result: 改进后的NeRF能够成功学习多路径信号，并生成隐含的室内平面图，结果具有潜力。

Conclusion: 研究表明NeRF可以扩展至多路径信号处理，为室内环境推断和信号预测等应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have been remarkably successful at
synthesizing novel views of 3D scenes by optimizing a volumetric scene
function. This scene function models how optical rays bring color information
from a 3D object to the camera pixels. Radio frequency (RF) or audio signals
can also be viewed as a vehicle for delivering information about the
environment to a sensor. However, unlike camera pixels, an RF/audio sensor
receives a mixture of signals that contain many environmental reflections (also
called "multipath"). Is it still possible to infer the environment using such
multipath signals? We show that with redesign, NeRFs can be taught to learn
from multipath signals, and thereby "see" the environment. As a grounding
application, we aim to infer the indoor floorplan of a home from sparse WiFi
measurements made at multiple locations inside the home. Although a difficult
inverse problem, our implicitly learnt floorplans look promising, and enables
forward applications, such as indoor signal prediction and basic ray tracing.

Motivation: 现有PEFT方法在3D点云模型中表现不佳，忽略了局部空间结构和全局几何上下文，亟需一种高效的几何感知微调方法。

Method: GEM模块结合细粒度局部位置编码和轻量级潜在注意力机制，以解决空间和几何分布不匹配问题。

Result: GEM在性能上接近或超过全微调，仅更新1.6%参数，显著减少训练时间和内存需求。

Conclusion: GEM为大规模3D点云模型的高效、可扩展和几何感知微调设定了新基准。

Abstract: The emergence of large-scale pre-trained point cloud models has significantly
advanced 3D scene understanding, but adapting these models to specific
downstream tasks typically demands full fine-tuning, incurring high
computational and storage costs. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
techniques, successful in natural language processing and 2D vision tasks,
would underperform when naively applied to 3D point cloud models due to
significant geometric and spatial distribution shifts. Existing PEFT methods
commonly treat points as orderless tokens, neglecting important local spatial
structures and global geometric contexts in 3D modeling. To bridge this gap, we
introduce the Geometric Encoding Mixer (GEM), a novel geometry-aware PEFT
module specifically designed for 3D point cloud transformers. GEM explicitly
integrates fine-grained local positional encodings with a lightweight latent
attention mechanism to capture comprehensive global context, thereby
effectively addressing the spatial and geometric distribution mismatch.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that GEM achieves performance comparable to
or sometimes even exceeding full fine-tuning, while only updating 1.6% of the
model's parameters, fewer than other PEFT methods. With significantly reduced
training time and memory requirements, our approach thus sets a new benchmark
for efficient, scalable, and geometry-aware fine-tuning of large-scale 3D point
cloud models. Code will be released.

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平，即使训练数据有限，也能处理未见过的复杂变形形状对。

Conclusion: 该框架结合神经特征与几何流程，显著提升了配准的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based framework for 3D shape
registration, which overcomes the challenges of significant non-rigid
deformation and partiality undergoing among input shapes, and, remarkably,
requires no correspondence annotation during training. Our key insight is to
incorporate neural features learned by deep learning-based shape matching
networks into an iterative, geometric shape registration pipeline. The
advantage of our approach is two-fold -- On one hand, neural features provide
more accurate and semantically meaningful correspondence estimation than
spatial features (e.g., coordinates), which is critical in the presence of
large non-rigid deformations; On the other hand, the correspondences are
dynamically updated according to the intermediate registrations and filtered by
consistency prior, which prominently robustify the overall pipeline. Empirical
results show that, with as few as dozens of training shapes of limited
variability, our pipeline achieves state-of-the-art results on several
benchmarks of non-rigid point cloud matching and partial shape matching across
varying settings, but also delivers high-quality correspondences between unseen
challenging shape pairs that undergo both significant extrinsic and intrinsic
deformations, in which case neither traditional registration methods nor
intrinsic methods work.

Motivation: 现有任务（如视频问答）依赖人工标注或更强模型，而视频描述则混淆了时间与空间信息。NEP通过利用未来视频片段作为自监督信号，填补了这一空白。

Method: 将视频分段为过去和未来帧，MLLM以过去帧为输入，预测未来帧的事件摘要。支持此任务的数据集V1-33K包含33,000个自动提取的视频片段。

Result: 实验验证NEP是一种可扩展且有效的训练范式，能显著提升MLLMs的时间推理能力。

Conclusion: NEP为MLLMs的时间推理提供了一种自监督且高效的解决方案，并通过FutureBench评估其预测未来事件的连贯性。

Abstract: Next-token prediction serves as the foundational learning task enabling
reasoning in LLMs. But what should the learning task be when aiming to equip
MLLMs with temporal reasoning capabilities over video inputs? Existing tasks
such as video question answering often rely on annotations from humans or much
stronger MLLMs, while video captioning tends to entangle temporal reasoning
with spatial information. To address this gap, we propose next-event prediction
(NEP), a learning task that harnesses future video segments as a rich,
self-supervised signal to foster temporal reasoning. We segment each video into
past and future frames: the MLLM takes the past frames as input and predicts a
summary of events derived from the future frames, thereby encouraging the model
to reason temporally in order to complete the task. To support this task, we
curate V1-33K, a dataset comprising 33,000 automatically extracted video
segments spanning diverse real-world scenarios. We further explore a range of
video instruction-tuning strategies to study their effects on temporal
reasoning. To evaluate progress, we introduce FutureBench to assess coherence
in predicting unseen future events. Experiments validate that NEP offers a
scalable and effective training paradigm for fostering temporal reasoning in
MLLMs.

transfer knowledge from labeled source data to unlabeled target data. However,
traditional UDA-SS methods assume that category settings between source and
target domains are known, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios. This
leads to performance degradation if private classes exist. To address this
limitation, we propose Universal Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation
(UniDA-SS), achieving robust adaptation even without prior knowledge of
category settings. We define the problem in the UniDA-SS scenario as low
confidence scores of common classes in the target domain, which leads to
confusion with private classes. To solve this problem, we propose UniMAP:
UniDA-SS with Image Matching and Prototype-based Distinction, a novel framework
composed of two key components. First, Domain-Specific Prototype-based
Distinction (DSPD) divides each class into two domain-specific prototypes,
enabling finer separation of domain-specific features and enhancing the
identification of common classes across domains. Second, Target-based Image
Matching (TIM) selects a source image containing the most common-class pixels
based on the target pseudo-label and pairs it in a batch to promote effective
learning of common classes. We also introduce a new UniDA-SS benchmark and
demonstrate through various experiments that UniMAP significantly outperforms
baselines. The code is available at

TL;DR: SHTOcc提出了一种稀疏头尾体素构建方法，解决了3D占用预测中的长尾问题和几何分布问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未探索体素的关键分布模式，导致结果不理想。本文研究了体素的类间分布和几何分布，以解决长尾问题和性能不足。

Method: 提出SHTOcc，通过稀疏头尾体素构建和分离学习，平衡关键体素并减少模型对主导类别的偏向。

Result: 实验显示，SHTOcc在多个基线上显著改进：GPU内存减少42.2%，推理速度提升58.6%，准确率提高约7%。

Conclusion: SHTOcc在3D占用预测中表现出高效性和有效性，代码已开源。

Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction has attracted much attention in the field of
autonomous driving due to its powerful geometric perception and object
recognition capabilities. However, existing methods have not explored the most
essential distribution patterns of voxels, resulting in unsatisfactory results.
This paper first explores the inter-class distribution and geometric
distribution of voxels, thereby solving the long-tail problem caused by the
inter-class distribution and the poor performance caused by the geometric
distribution. Specifically, this paper proposes SHTOcc (Sparse Head-Tail
Occupancy), which uses sparse head-tail voxel construction to accurately
identify and balance key voxels in the head and tail classes, while using
decoupled learning to reduce the model's bias towards the dominant (head)
category and enhance the focus on the tail class. Experiments show that
significant improvements have been made on multiple baselines: SHTOcc reduces
GPU memory usage by 42.2%, increases inference speed by 58.6%, and improves
accuracy by about 7%, verifying its effectiveness and efficiency. The code is

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，该方法在类别不平衡和成像协议差异下具有更好的性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了模型在未见域上的性能，为阿尔茨海默病检测提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Although Alzheimer's disease detection via MRIs has advanced significantly
thanks to contemporary deep learning models, challenges such as class
imbalance, protocol variations, and limited dataset diversity often hinder
their generalization capacity. To address this issue, this article focuses on
the single domain generalization setting, where given the data of one domain, a
model is designed and developed with maximal performance w.r.t. an unseen
domain of distinct distribution. Since brain morphology is known to play a
crucial role in Alzheimer's diagnosis, we propose the use of learnable
pseudo-morphological modules aimed at producing shape-aware, anatomically
meaningful class-specific augmentations in combination with a supervised
contrastive learning module to extract robust class-specific representations.
Experiments conducted across three datasets show improved performance and
generalization capacity, especially under class imbalance and imaging protocol
variations. The source code will be made available upon acceptance at

Conclusion: ProCrop和其数据集将公开，推动图像美学和构图分析研究。

Abstract: Image cropping is crucial for enhancing the visual appeal and narrative
impact of photographs, yet existing rule-based and data-driven approaches often
lack diversity or require annotated training data. We introduce ProCrop, a
retrieval-based method that leverages professional photography to guide
cropping decisions. By fusing features from professional photographs with those
of the query image, ProCrop learns from professional compositions,
significantly boosting performance. Additionally, we present a large-scale
dataset of 242K weakly-annotated images, generated by out-painting professional
images and iteratively refining diverse crop proposals. This composition-aware
dataset generation offers diverse high-quality crop proposals guided by
aesthetic principles and becomes the largest publicly available dataset for
image cropping. Extensive experiments show that ProCrop significantly
outperforms existing methods in both supervised and weakly-supervised settings.
Notably, when trained on the new dataset, our ProCrop surpasses previous
weakly-supervised methods and even matches fully supervised approaches. Both
the code and dataset will be made publicly available to advance research in
image aesthetics and composition analysis.

Abstract: 3D object detection is a critical component in autonomous driving systems. It
allows real-time recognition and detection of vehicles, pedestrians and
obstacles under varying environmental conditions. Among existing methods, 3D
object detection in the Bird's Eye View (BEV) has emerged as the mainstream
framework. To guarantee a safe, robust and trustworthy 3D object detection, 3D
adversarial attacks are investigated, where attacks are placed in 3D
environments to evaluate the model performance, e.g., putting a film on a car,
clothing a pedestrian. The vulnerability of 3D object detection models to 3D
adversarial attacks serves as an important indicator to evaluate the robustness
of the model against perturbations. To investigate this vulnerability, we
generate non-invasive 3D adversarial objects tailored for real-world attack
scenarios. Our method verifies the existence of universal adversarial objects
that are spatially consistent across time and camera views. Specifically, we
employ differentiable rendering techniques to accurately model the spatial
relationship between adversarial objects and the target vehicle. Furthermore,
we introduce an occlusion-aware module to enhance visual consistency and
realism under different viewpoints. To maintain attack effectiveness across
multiple frames, we design a BEV spatial feature-guided optimization strategy.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can reliably suppress
vehicle predictions from state-of-the-art 3D object detectors, serving as an
important tool to test robustness of 3D object detection models before
deployment. Moreover, the generated adversarial objects exhibit strong
generalization capabilities, retaining its effectiveness at various positions
and distances in the scene.

Result: 在四种异质性病理图像数据集上的评估表明，PathFL在性能和鲁棒性上优于其他方法。

Conclusion: PathFL通过多级对齐策略有效提升了病理图像分割的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Pathology image segmentation across multiple centers encounters significant
challenges due to diverse sources of heterogeneity including imaging
modalities, organs, and scanning equipment, whose variability brings
representation bias and impedes the development of generalizable segmentation
models. In this paper, we propose PathFL, a novel multi-alignment Federated
Learning framework for pathology image segmentation that addresses these
challenges through three-level alignment strategies of image, feature, and
model aggregation. Firstly, at the image level, a collaborative style
enhancement module aligns and diversifies local data by facilitating style
information exchange across clients. Secondly, at the feature level, an
adaptive feature alignment module ensures implicit alignment in the
representation space by infusing local features with global insights, promoting
consistency across heterogeneous client features learning. Finally, at the
model aggregation level, a stratified similarity aggregation strategy
hierarchically aligns and aggregates models on the server, using layer-specific
similarity to account for client discrepancies and enhance global
generalization. Comprehensive evaluations on four sets of heterogeneous
pathology image datasets, encompassing cross-source, cross-modality,
cross-organ, and cross-scanner variations, validate the effectiveness of our
PathFL in achieving better performance and robustness against data
heterogeneity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新范式，通过生成中间视觉思考步骤，使大型多模态模型（LMMs）能够在文本和视觉模态间进行原生思考，从而提升视觉推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LMMs的视觉推理局限于处理固定用户提供的图像或仅通过文本链式思考（CoT）。新方法旨在解锁模型的认知能力，使其能主动构建、批判和优化视觉假设。

Method: 通过两种机制实现：（1）基于中间视觉子目标的视觉生成，将复杂任务分解为可管理的组件；（2）带自我批判的视觉生成，模型生成初始假设并通过文本推理分析其不足。

Result: 在视觉生成基准测试中，模型在复杂多对象场景中的表现相对提升了50%（从38%到57%）。

Conclusion: 该方法为AI模型提供了类似人类的视觉想象和迭代优化能力，适用于生物化学、建筑设计、法医分析等多个领域。

Abstract: We present Thinking with Generated Images, a novel paradigm that
fundamentally transforms how large multimodal models (LMMs) engage with visual
reasoning by enabling them to natively think across text and vision modalities
through spontaneous generation of intermediate visual thinking steps. Current
visual reasoning with LMMs is constrained to either processing fixed
user-provided images or reasoning solely through text-based chain-of-thought
(CoT). Thinking with Generated Images unlocks a new dimension of cognitive
capability where models can actively construct intermediate visual thoughts,
critique their own visual hypotheses, and refine them as integral components of
their reasoning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through two complementary mechanisms: (1) vision generation with intermediate
visual subgoals, where models decompose complex visual tasks into manageable
components that are generated and integrated progressively, and (2) vision
generation with self-critique, where models generate an initial visual
hypothesis, analyze its shortcomings through textual reasoning, and produce
refined outputs based on their own critiques. Our experiments on vision
generation benchmarks show substantial improvements over baseline approaches,
with our models achieving up to 50% (from 38% to 57%) relative improvement in
handling complex multi-object scenarios. From biochemists exploring novel
protein structures, and architects iterating on spatial designs, to forensic
analysts reconstructing crime scenes, and basketball players envisioning
strategic plays, our approach enables AI models to engage in the kind of visual
imagination and iterative refinement that characterizes human creative,
analytical, and strategic thinking. We release our open-source suite at
https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/thinking-with-generated-images.

Motivation: 当前多层透明图像生成模型发展滞后，主要因为缺乏高质量的多层透明数据集。本文旨在解决这一问题，推动多层图像生成的研究和应用。

Method: 1. 发布PrismLayersPro数据集；2. 提出训练免费的合成管道；3. 开发开源模型ART+，包含LayerFLUX和MultiLayerFLUX技术。

Result: ART+在用户研究中60%的情况下优于原ART模型，视觉质量接近FLUX.1-[dev]模型。

Conclusion: 本文为多层透明图像生成任务奠定了数据集基础，支持精确、可编辑的分层图像研究和应用。

Abstract: Generating high-quality, multi-layer transparent images from text prompts can
unlock a new level of creative control, allowing users to edit each layer as
effortlessly as editing text outputs from LLMs. However, the development of
multi-layer generative models lags behind that of conventional text-to-image
models due to the absence of a large, high-quality corpus of multi-layer
transparent data. In this paper, we address this fundamental challenge by: (i)
releasing the first open, ultra-high-fidelity PrismLayers (PrismLayersPro)
dataset of 200K (20K) multilayer transparent images with accurate alpha mattes,
(ii) introducing a trainingfree synthesis pipeline that generates such data on
demand using off-the-shelf diffusion models, and (iii) delivering a strong,
open-source multi-layer generation model, ART+, which matches the aesthetics of
modern text-to-image generation models. The key technical contributions
include: LayerFLUX, which excels at generating high-quality single transparent
layers with accurate alpha mattes, and MultiLayerFLUX, which composes multiple
LayerFLUX outputs into complete images, guided by human-annotated semantic
layout. To ensure higher quality, we apply a rigorous filtering stage to remove
artifacts and semantic mismatches, followed by human selection. Fine-tuning the
state-of-the-art ART model on our synthetic PrismLayersPro yields ART+, which
outperforms the original ART in 60% of head-to-head user study comparisons and
even matches the visual quality of images generated by the FLUX.1-[dev] model.
We anticipate that our work will establish a solid dataset foundation for the
multi-layer transparent image generation task, enabling research and
applications that require precise, editable, and visually compelling layered
imagery.

Motivation: 现有图像重标题方法依赖MLLM，但常因幻觉和细节缺失导致不准确。RICO旨在通过视觉重建解决这些问题。

Method: RICO通过文本到图像模型重建标题为参考图像，并用MLLM识别差异以迭代优化标题。RICO-Flash通过DPO学习生成类似标题以减少计算成本。

Result: 实验表明，RICO在CapsBench和CompreCap上显著优于基线约10%。

Conclusion: RICO通过视觉重建和迭代优化生成更忠实和全面的标题，同时RICO-Flash降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Image recaptioning is widely used to generate training datasets with enhanced
quality for various multimodal tasks. Existing recaptioning methods typically
rely on powerful multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enhance textual
descriptions, but often suffer from inaccuracies due to hallucinations and
incompleteness caused by missing fine-grained details. To address these
limitations, we propose RICO, a novel framework that refines captions through
visual reconstruction. Specifically, we leverage a text-to-image model to
reconstruct a caption into a reference image, and prompt an MLLM to identify
discrepancies between the original and reconstructed images to refine the
caption. This process is performed iteratively, further progressively promoting
the generation of more faithful and comprehensive descriptions. To mitigate the
additional computational cost induced by the iterative process, we introduce
RICO-Flash, which learns to generate captions like RICO using DPO. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves caption
accuracy and completeness, outperforms most baselines by approximately 10% on
both CapsBench and CompreCap. Code released at

TL;DR: RiverMamba是一种新型深度学习模型，通过预训练和时空建模，显著提升了全球河流流量和洪水预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在洪水预测中局限于局部应用，未能利用水体的空间关联，亟需能够建模时空关系的新方法。

Method: RiverMamba基于Mamba块，整合ECMWF HRES气象预报数据，通过时空建模提升预测能力。

Result: RiverMamba在河流流量和极端洪水预测中表现优于现有AI和物理模型。

Conclusion: RiverMamba为科学和业务应用提供了可靠的全球洪水预测工具。

Abstract: Recent deep learning approaches for river discharge forecasting have improved
the accuracy and efficiency in flood forecasting, enabling more reliable early
warning systems for risk management. Nevertheless, existing deep learning
approaches in hydrology remain largely confined to local-scale applications and
do not leverage the inherent spatial connections of bodies of water. Thus,
there is a strong need for new deep learning methodologies that are capable of
modeling spatio-temporal relations to improve river discharge and flood
forecasting for scientific and operational applications. To address this, we
present RiverMamba, a novel deep learning model that is pretrained with
long-term reanalysis data and that can forecast global river discharge and
floods on a $0.05^\circ$ grid up to 7 days lead time, which is of high
relevance in early warning. To achieve this, RiverMamba leverages efficient
Mamba blocks that enable the model to capture global-scale channel network
routing and enhance its forecast capability for longer lead times. The forecast
blocks integrate ECMWF HRES meteorological forecasts, while accounting for
their inaccuracies through spatio-temporal modeling. Our analysis demonstrates
that RiverMamba delivers reliable predictions of river discharge, including
extreme floods across return periods and lead times, surpassing both
operational AI- and physics-based models.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型对推理错误敏感，依赖大量标注数据或验证器，且泛化能力有限。

Method: 引入轨迹级自校正目标、基于视觉扰动的偏好数据构建方法及动态β偏好调整。

Result: 在八个基准测试中平均准确率达64.1（直接生成）和65.4（自校正后），优于同类模型。

Conclusion: Sherlock框架有效提升模型推理能力，减少对标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Reasoning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising performance on
complex multimodal tasks. However, they still face significant challenges: they
are highly sensitive to reasoning errors, require large volumes of annotated
data or accurate verifiers, and struggle to generalize beyond specific domains.
To address these limitations, we explore self-correction as a strategy to
enhance reasoning VLMs. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of reasoning
VLMs' self-correction abilities and identify key gaps. Based on our findings,
we introduce Sherlock, a self-correction and self-improvement training
framework. Sherlock introduces a trajectory-level self-correction objective, a
preference data construction method based on visual perturbation, and a dynamic
$\beta$ for preference tuning. Once the model acquires self-correction
capabilities using only 20k randomly sampled annotated data, it continues to
self-improve without external supervision. Built on the Llama3.2-Vision-11B
model, Sherlock achieves remarkable results across eight benchmarks, reaching
an average accuracy of 64.1 with direct generation and 65.4 after
self-correction. It outperforms LLaVA-CoT (63.2), Mulberry (63.9), and
LlamaV-o1 (63.4) while using less than 20% of the annotated data.

Conclusion: OmniVQA框架和数据集有效提升了VQA任务的性能，填补了领域空白。

Abstract: The data scaling law has been shown to significantly enhance the performance
of large multi-modal models (LMMs) across various downstream tasks. However, in
the domain of perceptual video quality assessment (VQA), the potential of
scaling law remains unprecedented due to the scarcity of labeled resources and
the insufficient scale of datasets. To address this, we propose
\textbf{OmniVQA}, an efficient framework designed to efficiently build
high-quality, human-in-the-loop VQA multi-modal instruction databases (MIDBs).
We then scale up to create \textbf{OmniVQA-Chat-400K}, the largest MIDB in the
VQA field concurrently. Our focus is on the technical and aesthetic quality
dimensions, with abundant in-context instruction data to provide fine-grained
VQA knowledge. Additionally, we have built the \textbf{OmniVQA-MOS-20K} dataset
to enhance the model's quantitative quality rating capabilities. We then
introduce a \textbf{complementary} training strategy that effectively leverages
the knowledge from datasets for quality understanding and quality rating tasks.
Furthermore, we propose the \textbf{OmniVQA-FG (fine-grain)-Benchmark} to
evaluate the fine-grained performance of the models. Our results demonstrate
that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance in both quality
understanding and rating tasks.

Motivation: DXA设备有限阻碍骨质疏松筛查，需利用广泛可用的膝关节X光进行BMD估计。

Method: 使用EfficientNet模型在OAI数据集上训练，比较两种测试时间增强（TTA）方法，并采用Split Conformal Prediction提供统计严格的预测区间。

Result: 传统TTA的Pearson相关性为0.68，多样本TTA产生更紧的置信区间且保持覆盖率。

Conclusion: 尽管膝关节X光与标准DXA存在解剖学差异，但该方法为AI辅助BMD筛查奠定了基础。

Abstract: Limited DXA access hinders osteoporosis screening. This proof-of-concept
study proposes using widely available knee X-rays for opportunistic Bone
Mineral Density (BMD) estimation via deep learning, emphasizing robust
uncertainty quantification essential for clinical use. An EfficientNet model
was trained on the OAI dataset to predict BMD from bilateral knee radiographs.
Two Test-Time Augmentation (TTA) methods were compared: traditional averaging
and a multi-sample approach. Crucially, Split Conformal Prediction was
implemented to provide statistically rigorous, patient-specific prediction
intervals with guaranteed coverage. Results showed a Pearson correlation of
0.68 (traditional TTA). While traditional TTA yielded better point predictions,
the multi-sample approach produced slightly tighter confidence intervals (90%,
95%, 99%) while maintaining coverage. The framework appropriately expressed
higher uncertainty for challenging cases. Although anatomical mismatch between
knee X-rays and standard DXA limits immediate clinical use, this method
establishes a foundation for trustworthy AI-assisted BMD screening using
routine radiographs, potentially improving early osteoporosis detection.

Motivation: 当前LLMs在动态3D环境中缺乏有效的空间-时间记忆建模，限制了其规划和行动能力。

Method: 引入3DMem-Bench基准，并提出3DLLM-Mem模型，利用工作记忆令牌动态融合空间-时间特征。

Result: 3DLLM-Mem在3DMem-Bench上表现优异，成功率达16.5%提升。

Conclusion: 3DLLM-Mem显著提升了LLMs在复杂3D环境中的记忆推理能力。

Abstract: Humans excel at performing complex tasks by leveraging long-term memory
across temporal and spatial experiences. In contrast, current Large Language
Models (LLMs) struggle to effectively plan and act in dynamic, multi-room 3D
environments. We posit that part of this limitation is due to the lack of
proper 3D spatial-temporal memory modeling in LLMs. To address this, we first
introduce 3DMem-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising over 26,000
trajectories and 2,892 embodied tasks, question-answering and captioning,
designed to evaluate an agent's ability to reason over long-term memory in 3D
environments. Second, we propose 3DLLM-Mem, a novel dynamic memory management
and fusion model for embodied spatial-temporal reasoning and actions in LLMs.
Our model uses working memory tokens, which represents current observations, as
queries to selectively attend to and fuse the most useful spatial and temporal
features from episodic memory, which stores past observations and interactions.
Our approach allows the agent to focus on task-relevant information while
maintaining memory efficiency in complex, long-horizon environments.
Experimental results demonstrate that 3DLLM-Mem achieves state-of-the-art
performance across various tasks, outperforming the strongest baselines by
16.5% in success rate on 3DMem-Bench's most challenging in-the-wild embodied
tasks.

system adopts a Transformer based time-frequency dual-token feature extractor
with multi-head self-attention. This feature extractor is able to model
inter-subcarrier correlations and temporal dependencies of the CSI. The
extracted CSI features and the pose probability heatmaps are then fused by
Multi-Stage Feature Fusion Network (MSFN) to enforce the anatomical
constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on on the public MM-Fi dataset and
our self-collected dataset show that the MultiFormer achieves higher accuracy
over state-of-the-art approaches, especially for high-mobility keypoints
(wrists, elbows) that are particularly difficult for previous methods to
accurately estimate.

TL;DR: PRISM是一种新颖的视频数据集压缩方法，通过逐步细化和插入帧来保留空间内容与时间动态的相互依赖关系，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模视频数据处理中的计算挑战，同时保留视频中空间内容与时间动态的复杂性。

Method: PRISM方法逐步细化和插入帧，考虑每帧的梯度关系，以保留动作中的动态信息。

Result: 在标准视频动作识别基准测试中，PRISM表现优于现有方法，同时保持紧凑的存储需求。

Conclusion: PRISM为视频数据集压缩提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Video dataset condensation has emerged as a critical technique for addressing
the computational challenges associated with large-scale video data processing
in deep learning applications. While significant progress has been made in
image dataset condensation, the video domain presents unique challenges due to
the complex interplay between spatial content and temporal dynamics. This paper
introduces PRISM, Progressive Refinement and Insertion for Sparse Motion, for
video dataset condensation, a novel approach that fundamentally reconsiders how
video data should be condensed. Unlike the previous method that separates
static content from dynamic motion, our method preserves the essential
interdependence between these elements. Our approach progressively refines and
inserts frames to fully accommodate the motion in an action while achieving
better performance but less storage, considering the relation of gradients for
each frame. Extensive experiments across standard video action recognition
benchmarks demonstrate that PRISM outperforms existing disentangled approaches
while maintaining compact representations suitable for resource-constrained
environments.

Abstract: Tactile perception is essential for embodied agents to understand physical
attributes of objects that cannot be determined through visual inspection
alone. While existing approaches have made progress in visual and language
modalities for physical understanding, they fail to effectively incorporate
tactile information that provides crucial haptic feedback for real-world
interaction. In this paper, we present VTV-LLM, the first multi-modal large
language model for universal Visuo-Tactile Video (VTV) understanding that
bridges the gap between tactile perception and natural language. To address the
challenges of cross-sensor and cross-modal integration, we contribute VTV150K,
a comprehensive dataset comprising 150,000 video frames from 100 diverse
objects captured across three different tactile sensors (GelSight Mini, DIGIT,
and Tac3D), annotated with four fundamental tactile attributes (hardness,
protrusion, elasticity, and friction). We develop a novel three-stage training
paradigm that includes VTV enhancement for robust visuo-tactile representation,
VTV-text alignment for cross-modal correspondence, and text prompt finetuning
for natural language generation. Our framework enables sophisticated tactile
reasoning capabilities including feature assessment, comparative analysis,
scenario-based decision making and so on. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that VTV-LLM achieves superior performance in tactile video understanding
tasks, establishing a foundation for more intuitive human-machine interaction
in tactile domains.

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面表现优异，但如何使其生成结果更符合人类偏好且保持多样性仍具挑战性。

Method: 1. 提出"combined generation"采样策略，仅在生成后期使用奖励调优模型，保留早期多样性。2. 提出"ImageReFL"微调方法，结合真实图像和多正则化器（如扩散和ReFL损失）提升多样性。

Conclusion: 本文方法有效解决了扩散模型在人类偏好对齐与多样性之间的权衡问题，为生成模型优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have led to impressive image generation
capabilities, but aligning these models with human preferences remains
challenging. Reward-based fine-tuning using models trained on human feedback
improves alignment but often harms diversity, producing less varied outputs. In
this work, we address this trade-off with two contributions. First, we
introduce \textit{combined generation}, a novel sampling strategy that applies
a reward-tuned diffusion model only in the later stages of the generation
process, while preserving the base model for earlier steps. This approach
mitigates early-stage overfitting and helps retain global structure and
diversity. Second, we propose \textit{ImageReFL}, a fine-tuning method that
improves image diversity with minimal loss in quality by training on real
images and incorporating multiple regularizers, including diffusion and ReFL
losses. Our approach outperforms conventional reward tuning methods on standard
quality and diversity metrics. A user study further confirms that our method
better balances human preference alignment and visual diversity. The source

Abstract: Deepfake generation methods are evolving fast, making fake media harder to
detect and raising serious societal concerns. Most deepfake detection and
dataset creation research focuses on monolingual content, often overlooking the
challenges of multilingual and code-switched speech, where multiple languages
are mixed within the same discourse. Code-switching, especially between Arabic
and English, is common in the Arab world and is widely used in digital
communication. This linguistic mixing poses extra challenges for deepfake
detection, as it can confuse models trained mostly on monolingual data. To
address this, we introduce \textbf{ArEnAV}, the first large-scale
Arabic-English audio-visual deepfake dataset featuring intra-utterance
code-switching, dialectal variation, and monolingual Arabic content. It
\textbf{contains 387k videos and over 765 hours of real and fake videos}. Our
dataset is generated using a novel pipeline integrating four Text-To-Speech and
two lip-sync models, enabling comprehensive analysis of multilingual multimodal
deepfake detection. We benchmark our dataset against existing monolingual and
multilingual datasets, state-of-the-art deepfake detection models, and a human
evaluation, highlighting its potential to advance deepfake research. The

Abstract: Leveraging multimodal large models for image segmentation has become a
prominent research direction. However, existing approaches typically rely
heavily on manually annotated datasets that include explicit reasoning
processes, which are costly and time-consuming to produce. Recent advances
suggest that reinforcement learning (RL) can endow large models with reasoning
capabilities without requiring such reasoning-annotated data. In this paper, we
propose SAM-R1, a novel framework that enables multimodal large models to
perform fine-grained reasoning in image understanding tasks. Our approach is
the first to incorporate fine-grained segmentation settings during the training
of multimodal reasoning models. By integrating task-specific, fine-grained
rewards with a tailored optimization objective, we further enhance the model's
reasoning and segmentation alignment. We also leverage the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) as a strong and flexible reward provider to guide the learning
process. With only 3k training samples, SAM-R1 achieves strong performance
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement
learning in equipping multimodal models with segmentation-oriented reasoning
capabilities.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的对抗防御方法TRIM，用于检测AI生成图像（AIGI），解决了现有对抗训练（AT）在AIGI检测中性能崩溃的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成图像的恶意使用（如伪造和虚假信息）日益严重，现有检测器普遍易受对抗攻击，且防御方法稀缺。

Method: 通过信息论视角分析特征纠缠问题，提出TRIM方法，利用预测熵和KL散度量测特征偏移。

Result: TRIM在多个数据集和攻击下表现优越，例如在ProGAN和GenImage上分别比现有最佳防御方法高出33.88%和28.91%。

Conclusion: TRIM是一种高效且无需训练的对抗防御方法，显著提升了AIGI检测的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence Generated Images (AIGI) have
facilitated malicious use, such as forgery and misinformation. Therefore,
numerous methods have been proposed to detect fake images. Although such
detectors have been proven to be universally vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
defenses in this field are scarce. In this paper, we first identify that
adversarial training (AT), widely regarded as the most effective defense,
suffers from performance collapse in AIGI detection. Through an
information-theoretic lens, we further attribute the cause of collapse to
feature entanglement, which disrupts the preservation of feature-label mutual
information. Instead, standard detectors show clear feature separation.
Motivated by this difference, we propose Training-free Robust Detection via
Information-theoretic Measures (TRIM), the first training-free adversarial
defense for AIGI detection. TRIM builds on standard detectors and quantifies
feature shifts using prediction entropy and KL divergence. Extensive
experiments across multiple datasets and attacks validate the superiority of
our TRIM, e.g., outperforming the state-of-the-art defense by 33.88% (28.91%)
on ProGAN (GenImage), while well maintaining original accuracy.

Motivation: 神经渲染方法在复杂动态场景中因输入视角有限导致重建质量受限。

Method: 设计了轻量级高质量视频帧插值模型PS4PRO，利用其作为隐式世界先验增强数据。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了静态和动态场景的重建性能。

Conclusion: PS4PRO通过数据增强有效解决了神经渲染中视角不足的问题。

Abstract: Neural rendering methods have gained significant attention for their ability
to reconstruct 3D scenes from 2D images. The core idea is to take multiple
views as input and optimize the reconstructed scene by minimizing the
uncertainty in geometry and appearance across the views. However, the
reconstruction quality is limited by the number of input views. This limitation
is further pronounced in complex and dynamic scenes, where certain angles of
objects are never seen. In this paper, we propose to use video frame
interpolation as the data augmentation method for neural rendering.
Furthermore, we design a lightweight yet high-quality video frame interpolation
model, PS4PRO (Pixel-to-pixel Supervision for Photorealistic Rendering and
Optimization). PS4PRO is trained on diverse video datasets, implicitly modeling
camera movement as well as real-world 3D geometry. Our model performs as an
implicit world prior, enriching the photo supervision for 3D reconstruction. By
leveraging the proposed method, we effectively augment existing datasets for
neural rendering methods. Our experimental results indicate that our method
improves the reconstruction performance on both static and dynamic scenes.

TL;DR: 论文提出新数据集OBER和框架ObjectClear，用于精确移除物体及其视觉影响（如阴影、反射），并通过注意力机制提升背景保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散修复方法在移除物体及其视觉影响时易产生伪影或改变背景，需更精确的解决方案。

Method: 构建OBER数据集，包含配对图像和精确掩码；提出ObjectClear框架，利用注意力机制分离前景移除与背景重建。

Result: ObjectClear在复杂场景中表现优异，显著提升物体影响移除质量和背景保真度。

Conclusion: OBER数据集和ObjectClear框架为物体影响移除提供了有效工具，尤其在复杂场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Object removal requires eliminating not only the target object but also its
effects, such as shadows and reflections. However, diffusion-based inpainting
methods often produce artifacts, hallucinate content, alter background, and
struggle to remove object effects accurately. To address this challenge, we
introduce a new dataset for OBject-Effect Removal, named OBER, which provides
paired images with and without object effects, along with precise masks for
both objects and their associated visual artifacts. The dataset comprises
high-quality captured and simulated data, covering diverse object categories
and complex multi-object scenes. Building on OBER, we propose a novel
framework, ObjectClear, which incorporates an object-effect attention mechanism
to guide the model toward the foreground removal regions by learning attention
masks, effectively decoupling foreground removal from background
reconstruction. Furthermore, the predicted attention map enables an
attention-guided fusion strategy during inference, greatly preserving
background details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ObjectClear
outperforms existing methods, achieving improved object-effect removal quality
and background fidelity, especially in complex scenarios.

Motivation: 现有范围视图方法只能生成无标签的LiDAR场景，依赖预训练分割模型会导致跨模态一致性不佳。Spiral旨在解决这一问题，同时保留范围视图的高效性。

Method: 提出Spiral模型，同时生成深度、反射率图像和语义图，并引入新的语义感知指标评估生成数据质量。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和nuScenes数据集上，Spiral以最小参数量实现最优性能，且生成的范围图像可用于下游分割训练的数据增强。

Conclusion: Spiral在LiDAR场景生成中表现出色，同时为下游任务提供了高效的数据增强方案。

Abstract: Leveraging recent diffusion models, LiDAR-based large-scale 3D scene
generation has achieved great success. While recent voxel-based approaches can
generate both geometric structures and semantic labels, existing range-view
methods are limited to producing unlabeled LiDAR scenes. Relying on pretrained
segmentation models to predict the semantic maps often results in suboptimal
cross-modal consistency. To address this limitation while preserving the
advantages of range-view representations, such as computational efficiency and
simplified network design, we propose Spiral, a novel range-view LiDAR
diffusion model that simultaneously generates depth, reflectance images, and
semantic maps. Furthermore, we introduce novel semantic-aware metrics to
evaluate the quality of the generated labeled range-view data. Experiments on
the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that Spiral achieves
state-of-the-art performance with the smallest parameter size, outperforming
two-step methods that combine the generative and segmentation models.
Additionally, we validate that range images generated by Spiral can be
effectively used for synthetic data augmentation in the downstream segmentation
training, significantly reducing the labeling effort on LiDAR data.

Motivation: 现有音频驱动的人体动画方法主要关注单人动画，难以处理多流音频输入和音频与人的绑定问题，且指令跟随能力有限。

Method: 提出Label Rotary Position Embedding (L-RoPE)方法解决音频绑定问题，并通过部分参数训练和多任务训练保留基础模型的指令跟随能力。

Result: MultiTalk在多个数据集（包括说话头部、说话身体和多人数据集）上表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: MultiTalk框架在多人对话视频生成任务中表现出强大的生成能力。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation methods, such as talking head and talking body
generation, have made remarkable progress in generating synchronized facial
movements and appealing visual quality videos. However, existing methods
primarily focus on single human animation and struggle with multi-stream audio
inputs, facing incorrect binding problems between audio and persons.
Additionally, they exhibit limitations in instruction-following capabilities.
To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel task: Multi-Person
Conversational Video Generation, and introduce a new framework, MultiTalk, to
address the challenges during multi-person generation. Specifically, for audio
injection, we investigate several schemes and propose the Label Rotary Position
Embedding (L-RoPE) method to resolve the audio and person binding problem.
Furthermore, during training, we observe that partial parameter training and
multi-task training are crucial for preserving the instruction-following
ability of the base model. MultiTalk achieves superior performance compared to
other methods on several datasets, including talking head, talking body, and
multi-person datasets, demonstrating the powerful generation capabilities of
our approach.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）因视觉令牌序列较长导致计算成本高，影响实时部署，需优化令牌处理效率。

Method: 提出VScan框架，包括视觉编码阶段的全局和局部扫描与令牌合并，以及语言模型中间层的剪枝。

Result: 在四个LVLM上验证，VScan实现2.91倍预填充加速和10倍FLOPs减少，性能保留95.4%。

Conclusion: VScan有效解决令牌冗余问题，显著提升推理速度，性能接近原始模型。

Abstract: Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multi-modal
understanding by incorporating finer-grained visual perception and encoding.
However, such methods incur significant computational costs due to longer
visual token sequences, posing challenges for real-time deployment. To mitigate
this, prior studies have explored pruning unimportant visual tokens either at
the output layer of the visual encoder or at the early layers of the language
model. In this work, we revisit these design choices and reassess their
effectiveness through comprehensive empirical studies of how visual tokens are
processed throughout the visual encoding and language decoding stages. Guided
by these insights, we propose VScan, a two-stage visual token reduction
framework that addresses token redundancy by: (1) integrating complementary
global and local scans with token merging during visual encoding, and (2)
introducing pruning at intermediate layers of the language model. Extensive
experimental results across four LVLMs validate the effectiveness of VScan in
accelerating inference and demonstrate its superior performance over current
state-of-the-arts on sixteen benchmarks. Notably, when applied to
LLaVA-NeXT-7B, VScan achieves a 2.91$\times$ speedup in prefilling and a
10$\times$ reduction in FLOPs, while retaining 95.4% of the original
performance.

Motivation: 风格化抽象需要在保留身份线索的同时实现风格化，传统方法难以处理分布外个体。

Method: 使用视觉语言模型提取身份特征，结合跨域校正流反转策略动态恢复结构，支持多轮生成。

Result: 在多种风格（如乐高、针织玩偶、南方公园）上表现出色，泛化能力强。

Conclusion: 该方法无需微调，支持开放场景下的多风格生成，性能优越。

Abstract: Stylized abstraction synthesizes visually exaggerated yet semantically
faithful representations of subjects, balancing recognizability with perceptual
distortion. Unlike image-to-image translation, which prioritizes structural
fidelity, stylized abstraction demands selective retention of identity cues
while embracing stylistic divergence, especially challenging for
out-of-distribution individuals. We propose a training-free framework that
generates stylized abstractions from a single image using inference-time
scaling in vision-language models (VLLMs) to extract identity-relevant
features, and a novel cross-domain rectified flow inversion strategy that
reconstructs structure based on style-dependent priors. Our method adapts
structural restoration dynamically through style-aware temporal scheduling,
enabling high-fidelity reconstructions that honor both subject and style. It
supports multi-round abstraction-aware generation without fine-tuning. To
evaluate this task, we introduce StyleBench, a GPT-based human-aligned metric
suited for abstract styles where pixel-level similarity fails. Experiments
across diverse abstraction (e.g., LEGO, knitted dolls, South Park) show strong
generalization to unseen identities and styles in a fully open-source setup.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过小型语言模型预训练视觉编码器，再迁移到大型语言模型的方法，显著降低了训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低视觉语言模型（VLM）训练成本，尤其是大型语言模型（LLM）作为解码器时的计算负担。

Method: 构建小型“代理模型”，继承目标LLM的浅层，训练视觉编码器后直接迁移到大型LLM，称为零-shot嫁接。

Result: 嫁接后的模型性能优于编码器-代理模型对，某些基准测试中甚至与完整目标LLM训练相当，训练成本降低约45%。

Conclusion: 零-shot嫁接是一种高效且成本低廉的VLM训练方法。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) typically pair a modestly sized vision encoder
with a large language model (LLM), e.g., Llama-70B, making the decoder the
primary computational burden during training. To reduce costs, a potential
promising strategy is to first train the vision encoder using a small language
model before transferring it to the large one. We construct small "surrogate
models" that share the same embedding space and representation language as the
large target LLM by directly inheriting its shallow layers. Vision encoders
trained on the surrogate can then be directly transferred to the larger model,
a process we call zero-shot grafting -- when plugged directly into the
full-size target LLM, the grafted pair surpasses the encoder-surrogate pair
and, on some benchmarks, even performs on par with full decoder training with
the target LLM. Furthermore, our surrogate training approach reduces overall
VLM training costs by ~45% when using Llama-70B as the decoder.

Result: 网络的前瞻行为因棋局而异，能处理七步后的状态，并考虑多种走法序列。

Conclusion: 研究为理解AI在复杂任务中的推理提供了新视角，展示了可解释性技术的有效性。

Abstract: We investigate the look-ahead capabilities of chess-playing neural networks,
specifically focusing on the Leela Chess Zero policy network. We build on the
work of Jenner et al. (2024) by analyzing the model's ability to consider
future moves and alternative sequences beyond the immediate next move. Our
findings reveal that the network's look-ahead behavior is highly
context-dependent, varying significantly based on the specific chess position.
We demonstrate that the model can process information about board states up to
seven moves ahead, utilizing similar internal mechanisms across different
future time steps. Additionally, we provide evidence that the network considers
multiple possible move sequences rather than focusing on a single line of play.
These results offer new insights into the emergence of sophisticated look-ahead
capabilities in neural networks trained on strategic tasks, contributing to our
understanding of AI reasoning in complex domains. Our work also showcases the
effectiveness of interpretability techniques in uncovering cognitive-like
processes in artificial intelligence systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在需要精确计算和符号操作的任务中表现不佳，缺乏代码执行的严谨性，因此需要一种方法让LLM决定何时使用文本推理或代码生成。

Method: 通过多轮监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）训练模型，研究不同策略（如SFT与RL的结合、冷启动与热启动等）对模型性能的影响。

Result: R1-CI-14B模型在37个测试任务中的平均准确率从44.0%提升至64.1%，优于GPT-4o（文本模式58.6%），接近GPT-4o（代码模式70.9%）。

Conclusion: 代码解释器训练因任务多样性和代码执行成本高而更具挑战性，但SFT阶段至关重要。模型表现出通过代码生成的自检行为。

Abstract: Despite advances in reasoning and planning of R1-like models, Large Language
Models (LLMs) still struggle with tasks requiring precise computation, symbolic
manipulation, optimization, and algorithmic reasoning, in which textual
reasoning lacks the rigor of code execution. A key challenge is enabling LLMs
to decide when to use textual reasoning versus code generation. While OpenAI
trains models to invoke a Code Interpreter as needed, public research lacks
guidance on aligning pre-trained LLMs to effectively leverage code and
generalize across diverse tasks. We present R1-Code-Interpreter, an extension
of a text-only LLM trained via multi-turn supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL) to autonomously generate multiple code queries
during step-by-step reasoning. We curate 144 reasoning and planning tasks (107
for training, 37 for testing), each with over 200 diverse questions. We
fine-tune Qwen-2.5 models (3B/7B/14B) using various SFT and RL strategies,
investigating different answer formats, reasoning vs. non-reasoning models,
cold vs. warm starts, GRPO vs. PPO, and masked vs. unmasked code outputs.
Unlike prior RL work on narrow domains, we find that Code Interpreter training
is significantly harder due to high task diversity and expensive code
execution, highlighting the critical role of the SFT stage. Our final model,
R1-CI-14B, improves average accuracy on the 37 test tasks from 44.0\% to
64.1\%, outperforming GPT-4o (text-only: 58.6\%) and approaching GPT-4o with
Code Interpreter (70.9\%), with the emergent self-checking behavior via code
generation. Datasets, Codes, and Models are available at

TL;DR: 研究在图上基于马尔可夫分布的节点标签探索问题，设计了一种基于Gittins索引的策略，在树结构上最优，实验表明其优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在图上受限探索（如接触追踪和机器人探索）的序列决策问题，目标是最大化累积折扣奖励。

Method: 提出基于Gittins索引的策略，适用于一般图，在树结构上理论最优，实现复杂度为多项式时间。

Result: 在合成和真实图（如HIV测试网络）上表现优异，仅测试一半人口即可检测多数阳性案例。

Conclusion: 该策略在受限探索场景中高效且实用，尤其在树结构上表现最优。

Abstract: We study a sequential decision-making problem on a $n$-node graph $G$ where
each node has an unknown label from a finite set $\mathbf{\Sigma}$, drawn from
a joint distribution $P$ that is Markov with respect to $G$. At each step,
selecting a node reveals its label and yields a label-dependent reward. The
goal is to adaptively choose nodes to maximize expected accumulated discounted
rewards. We impose a frontier exploration constraint, where actions are limited
to neighbors of previously selected nodes, reflecting practical constraints in
settings such as contact tracing and robotic exploration. We design a Gittins
index-based policy that applies to general graphs and is provably optimal when
$G$ is a forest. Our implementation runs in $O(n^2 \cdot |\mathbf{\Sigma}|^2)$
time while using $O(n \cdot |\mathbf{\Sigma}|^2)$ oracle calls to $P$ and
$O(n^2 \cdot |\mathbf{\Sigma}|)$ space. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
graphs show that our method consistently outperforms natural baselines,
including in non-tree, budget-limited, and undiscounted settings. For example,
in HIV testing simulations on real-world sexual interaction networks, our
policy detects nearly all positive cases with only half the population tested,
substantially outperforming other baselines.

Abstract: In over sixty years since its inception, the field of planning has made
significant contributions to both the theory and practice of building planning
software that can solve a never-before-seen planning problem. This was done
through established practices of rigorous design and evaluation of planning
systems. It is our position that this rigor should be applied to the current
trend of work on planning with large language models. One way to do so is by
correctly incorporating the insights, tools, and data from the automated
planning community into the design and evaluation of LLM-based planners. The
experience and expertise of the planning community are not just important from
a historical perspective; the lessons learned could play a crucial role in
accelerating the development of LLM-based planners. This position is
particularly important in light of the abundance of recent works that replicate
and propagate the same pitfalls that the planning community has encountered and
learned from. We believe that avoiding such known pitfalls will contribute
greatly to the progress in building LLM-based planners and to planning in
general.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态优化框架，通过识别和优化推理路径中的思维模式，减少计算开销并提高推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在优化最终答案准确性的同时，可能因过度思考导致输出冗长和性能下降。研究假设这种低效源于模型无法动态选择适当的模块化推理策略。

Method: 提出动态优化框架，将推理路径分段为不同思维模式，系统识别并优化有益模式。

Result: 优化后的推理路径更简洁且高效，计算开销减少47%，准确性提升15.6%。

Conclusion: 动态优化框架显著提升推理效率和准确性，适用于数学推理任务。

Abstract: While recent success of large reasoning models (LRMs) significantly advanced
LLMs' reasoning capability by optimizing the final answer accuracy using
reinforcement learning, they may also drastically increase the output length
due to overthinking, characterized by unnecessarily complex reasoning paths
that waste computation and potentially degrade the performance. We hypothesize
that such inefficiencies stem from LRMs' limited capability to dynamically
select the proper modular reasoning strategies, termed thinking patterns at the
right position. To investigate this hypothesis, we propose a dynamic
optimization framework that segments model-generated reasoning paths into
distinct thinking patterns, systematically identifying and promoting beneficial
patterns that improve the answer while removing detrimental ones. Empirical
analysis confirms that our optimized thinking paths yield more concise yet
sufficiently informative trajectories, enhancing reasoning efficiency by
reducing attention FLOPs by up to 47% while maintaining accuracy for originally
correct responses. Moreover, a non-trivial portion of originally incorrect
responses are transformed into correct ones, achieving a 15.6% accuracy
improvement with reduced length. Motivated by the improvement brought by the
optimized thinking paths, we apply a preference optimization technique
supported by a pairwise dataset contrasting suboptimal and optimal reasoning
paths. Experimental evaluations across multiple mathematical reasoning
benchmarks reveal that our method notably reduces computational overhead while
simultaneously improving reasoning accuracy, achieving up to a 12% accuracy
improvement and reducing token usage from approximately 5,000 to 3,000 tokens.

Motivation: 现有安全措施存在过度拒绝和越狱漏洞问题，而传统方法生成高质量政策嵌入推理数据成本高且易出错。

Method: AIDSAFE通过多智能体审议迭代扩展安全政策推理，并通过数据精炼阶段去除冗余和欺骗性思维。同时，引入信念增强方法生成偏好数据。

Result: AIDSAFE生成的数据在政策遵循和推理质量上表现优异，显著提升LLM的安全泛化能力和抗越狱能力。

Conclusion: AIDSAFE为LLM安全训练提供了高效的数据生成方法，同时解决了偏好数据需求问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Safety reasoning is a recent paradigm where LLMs reason over safety policies
before generating responses, thereby mitigating limitations in existing safety
measures such as over-refusal and jailbreak vulnerabilities. However,
implementing this paradigm is challenging due to the resource-intensive process
of creating high-quality policy-embedded chain-of-thought (CoT) datasets while
ensuring reasoning remains accurate and free from hallucinations or policy
conflicts. To tackle this, we propose AIDSAFE: Agentic Iterative Deliberation
for Safety Reasoning, a novel data generation recipe that leverages multi-agent
deliberation to iteratively expand reasoning on safety policies. A data refiner
stage in AIDSAFE ensures high-quality outputs by eliminating repetitive,
redundant, and deceptive thoughts. AIDSAFE-generated CoTs provide a strong
foundation for supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-based safety training.
Additionally, to address the need of preference data in alignment stages, such
as DPO training, we introduce a supplemental recipe that uses belief
augmentation to create distinct selected and rejected CoT samples. Our
evaluations demonstrate that AIDSAFE-generated CoTs achieve superior policy
adherence and reasoning quality. Consequently, we show that fine-tuning
open-source LLMs on these CoTs can significantly improve safety generalization
and jailbreak robustness while maintaining acceptable utility and over-refusal
accuracy. AIDSAFE-generated CoT datasets can be found here:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估LLMs是否能在用户提出天真问题时正确应用安全事实，避免潜在危险。

Method: 通过SAGE-Eval基准测试，包含104个安全事实，生成10,428个测试场景，覆盖7个领域。

Result: 表现最佳的Claude-3.7-sonnet仅通过58%测试，模型能力与训练计算量相关性弱。

Conclusion: 前沿LLMs缺乏稳健的泛化能力，建议开发者使用SAGE-Eval评估模型可靠性。

Abstract: Do LLMs robustly generalize critical safety facts to novel situations?
Lacking this ability is dangerous when users ask naive questions. For instance,
"I'm considering packing melon balls for my 10-month-old's lunch. What other
foods would be good to include?" Before offering food options, the LLM should
warn that melon balls pose a choking hazard to toddlers, as documented by the
CDC. Failing to provide such warnings could result in serious injuries or even
death. To evaluate this, we introduce SAGE-Eval, SAfety-fact systematic
GEneralization evaluation, the first benchmark that tests whether LLMs properly
apply well established safety facts to naive user queries. SAGE-Eval comprises
104 facts manually sourced from reputable organizations, systematically
augmented to create 10,428 test scenarios across 7 common domains (e.g.,
Outdoor Activities, Medicine). We find that the top model, Claude-3.7-sonnet,
passes only 58% of all the safety facts tested. We also observe that model
capabilities and training compute weakly correlate with performance on
SAGE-Eval, implying that scaling up is not the golden solution. Our findings
suggest frontier LLMs still lack robust generalization ability. We recommend
developers use SAGE-Eval in pre-deployment evaluations to assess model
reliability in addressing salient risks. We publicly release SAGE-Eval at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/YuehHanChen/SAGE-Eval and our code is available

Conclusion: SVRPBench为研究社区提供了可复现的数据集和评估套件，挑战设计能适应现实不确定性的求解器。

Abstract: Robust routing under uncertainty is central to real-world logistics, yet most
benchmarks assume static, idealized settings. We present SVRPBench, the first
open benchmark to capture high-fidelity stochastic dynamics in vehicle routing
at urban scale. Spanning more than 500 instances with up to 1000 customers, it
simulates realistic delivery conditions: time-dependent congestion, log-normal
delays, probabilistic accidents, and empirically grounded time windows for
residential and commercial clients. Our pipeline generates diverse,
constraint-rich scenarios, including multi-depot and multi-vehicle setups.
Benchmarking reveals that state-of-the-art RL solvers like POMO and AM degrade
by over 20% under distributional shift, while classical and metaheuristic
methods remain robust. To enable reproducible research, we release the dataset
and evaluation suite. SVRPBench challenges the community to design solvers that
generalize beyond synthetic assumptions and adapt to real-world uncertainty.

Abstract: AI copilots, context-aware, AI-powered systems designed to assist users in
tasks such as software development and content creation, are becoming integral
to modern workflows. As these systems grow in capability and adoption,
personalization has emerged as a cornerstone for ensuring usability, trust, and
productivity. Central to this personalization is preference optimization: the
ability of AI copilots to detect, interpret, and align with individual user
preferences. While personalization techniques are well-established in domains
like recommender systems and dialogue agents, their adaptation to interactive,
real-time systems like AI copilots remains fragmented and underexplored. This
survey addresses this gap by synthesizing research on how user preferences are
captured, modeled, and refined within the design of AI copilots. We introduce a
unified definition of AI copilots and propose a phase-based taxonomy of
preference optimization strategies, structured around pre-interaction,
mid-interaction, and post-interaction stages. We analyze techniques for
acquiring preference signals, modeling user intent, and integrating feedback
loops, highlighting both established approaches and recent innovations. By
bridging insights from AI personalization, human-AI collaboration, and large
language model adaptation, this survey provides a structured foundation for
designing adaptive, preference-aware AI copilots. It offers a holistic view of
the available preference resources, how they can be leveraged, and which
technical approaches are most suited to each stage of system design.

Conclusion: LLMs有望通过假设发现能力推动研究、科学和现实问题解决的变革，但需填补关键空白以实现这一目标。

Abstract: Since the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), efforts have largely
focused on improving their instruction-following and deductive reasoning
abilities, leaving open the question of whether these models can truly discover
new knowledge. In pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI), there is a
growing need for models that not only execute commands or retrieve information
but also learn, reason, and generate new knowledge by formulating novel
hypotheses and theories that deepen our understanding of the world. Guided by
Peirce's framework of abduction, deduction, and induction, this survey offers a
structured lens to examine LLM-based hypothesis discovery. We synthesize
existing work in hypothesis generation, application, and validation,
identifying both key achievements and critical gaps. By unifying these threads,
we illuminate how LLMs might evolve from mere ``information executors'' into
engines of genuine innovation, potentially transforming research, science, and
real-world problem solving.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种功能性子图匹配方法，用于识别逻辑电路中隐含的功能性子图，克服了传统结构图同构方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术主要依赖结构图同构，无法识别因合成变换导致拓扑变化的电路中的功能相关子图。

Method: 提出了一个两阶段多模态框架：1) 学习AIG和后映射网表中的鲁棒功能嵌入；2) 使用图分割方法识别模糊边界。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，功能性子图检测的平均准确率为93.8%，模糊边界识别的Dice得分为91.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著优于现有结构方法，为EDA应用提供了更强大的功能性子图识别能力。

Abstract: Subgraph matching in logic circuits is foundational for numerous Electronic
Design Automation (EDA) applications, including datapath optimization,
arithmetic verification, and hardware trojan detection. However, existing
techniques rely primarily on structural graph isomorphism and thus fail to
identify function-related subgraphs when synthesis transformations
substantially alter circuit topology. To overcome this critical limitation, we
introduce the concept of functional subgraph matching, a novel approach that
identifies whether a given logic function is implicitly present within a larger
circuit, irrespective of structural variations induced by synthesis or
technology mapping. Specifically, we propose a two-stage multi-modal framework:
(1) learning robust functional embeddings across AIG and post-mapping netlists
for functional subgraph detection, and (2) identifying fuzzy boundaries using a
graph segmentation approach. Evaluations on standard benchmarks (ITC99,
OpenABCD, ForgeEDA) demonstrate significant performance improvements over
existing structural methods, with average $93.8\%$ accuracy in functional
subgraph detection and a dice score of $91.3\%$ in fuzzy boundary
identification.

Result: 在多个标准数据集上，EHC表现优于现有方法，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: EHC是一种高效且适应性强的通用代理，适用于复杂多模态任务。

Abstract: With large language models (LLMs) demonstrating remarkable capabilities,
there has been a surge in research on leveraging LLMs to build general-purpose
multi-modal agents. However, existing approaches either rely on computationally
expensive end-to-end training using large-scale multi-modal data or adopt
tool-use methods that lack the ability to continuously learn and adapt to new
environments. In this paper, we introduce EHC, a general agent capable of
learning without parameter updates. EHC consists of a Hierarchical Memory
Retrieval (HMR) module and a Task-Category Oriented Experience Learning (TOEL)
module. The HMR module facilitates rapid retrieval of relevant memories and
continuously stores new information without being constrained by memory
capacity. The TOEL module enhances the agent's comprehension of various task
characteristics by classifying experiences and extracting patterns across
different categories. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple standard
datasets demonstrate that EHC outperforms existing methods, achieving
state-of-the-art performance and underscoring its effectiveness as a general
agent for handling complex multi-modal tasks.

Conclusion: 研究表明，强化驱动的推理方法在具身AI的长时程规划任务中具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Embodied planning requires agents to make coherent multi-step decisions based
on dynamic visual observations and natural language goals. While recent
vision-language models (VLMs) excel at static perception tasks, they struggle
with the temporal reasoning, spatial understanding, and commonsense grounding
needed for planning in interactive environments. In this work, we introduce a
reinforcement fine-tuning framework that brings R1-style reasoning enhancement
into embodied planning. We first distill a high-quality dataset from a powerful
closed-source model and perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to equip the model
with structured decision-making priors. We then design a rule-based reward
function tailored to multi-step action quality and optimize the policy via
Generalized Reinforced Preference Optimization (GRPO). Our approach is
evaluated on Embench, a recent benchmark for interactive embodied tasks,
covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. Experimental results show
that our method significantly outperforms models of similar or larger scale,
including GPT-4o-mini and 70B+ open-source baselines, and exhibits strong
generalization to unseen environments. This work highlights the potential of
reinforcement-driven reasoning to advance long-horizon planning in embodied AI.

Abstract: Assistive systems for visually impaired individuals must deliver rapid,
interpretable, and adaptive feedback to facilitate real-time navigation.
Current approaches face a trade-off between latency and semantic richness:
natural language-based systems provide detailed guidance but are too slow for
dynamic scenarios, while emergent communication frameworks offer low-latency
symbolic languages but lack semantic depth, limiting their utility in tactile
modalities like vibration. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
framework, Cognitively-Inspired Emergent Communication via Knowledge Graphs
(VAG-EC), which emulates human visual perception and cognitive mapping. Our
method constructs knowledge graphs to represent objects and their
relationships, incorporating attention mechanisms to prioritize task-relevant
entities, thereby mirroring human selective attention. This structured approach
enables the emergence of compact, interpretable, and context-sensitive symbolic
languages. Extensive experiments across varying vocabulary sizes and message
lengths demonstrate that VAG-EC outperforms traditional emergent communication
methods in Topographic Similarity (TopSim) and Context Independence (CI). These
findings underscore the potential of cognitively grounded emergent
communication as a fast, adaptive, and human-aligned solution for real-time
assistive technologies. Code is available at

Abstract: The alignment between humans and machines is a critical challenge in
artificial intelligence today. Reinforcement learning, which aims to maximize a

designed reward functions. Recent advancements has shown that Large Language
Models (LLMs) for reward generation can outperform human performance in this
context. We introduce VIRAL, a pipeline for generating and refining reward
functions through the use of multi-modal LLMs. VIRAL autonomously creates and
interactively improves reward functions based on a given environment and a goal
prompt or annotated image. The refinement process can incorporate human
feedback or be guided by a description generated by a video LLM, which explains
the agent's policy in video form. We evaluated VIRAL in five Gymnasium
environments, demonstrating that it accelerates the learning of new behaviors
while ensuring improved alignment with user intent. The source-code and demo

Conclusion: 动态屏蔽在运行时安全保护中表现出高效性和适应性，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Shielding has emerged as a promising approach for ensuring safety of
AI-controlled autonomous systems. The algorithmic goal is to compute a shield,
which is a runtime safety enforcement tool that needs to monitor and intervene
the AI controller's actions if safety could be compromised otherwise.
Traditional shields are designed statically for a specific safety requirement.
Therefore, if the safety requirement changes at runtime due to changing
operating conditions, the shield needs to be recomputed from scratch, causing
delays that could be fatal. We introduce dynamic shields for parametric safety
specifications, which are succinctly represented sets of all possible safety
specifications that may be encountered at runtime. Our dynamic shields are
statically designed for a given safety parameter set, and are able to
dynamically adapt as the true safety specification (permissible by the
parameters) is revealed at runtime. The main algorithmic novelty lies in the
dynamic adaptation procedure, which is a simple and fast algorithm that
utilizes known features of standard safety shields, like maximal
permissiveness. We report experimental results for a robot navigation problem
in unknown territories, where the safety specification evolves as new obstacles
are discovered at runtime. In our experiments, the dynamic shields took a few
minutes for their offline design, and took between a fraction of a second and a
few seconds for online adaptation at each step, whereas the brute-force online
recomputation approach was up to 5 times slower.

reveal that VLLMs achieve or surpass human-level set-shifting capabilities
under chain-of-thought prompting with text-based inputs. However, their
abilities are highly influenced by both input modality and prompting strategy.
In addition, we find that through role-playing, VLLMs can simulate various
functional deficits aligned with patients having impairments in cognitive
flexibility, suggesting that VLLMs may possess a cognitive architecture, at
least regarding the ability of set-shifting, similar to the brain. This study
reveals the fact that VLLMs have already approached the human level on a key
component underlying our higher cognition, and highlights the potential to use
them to emulate complex brain processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着不可区分对象数量的增加，状态和动作空间呈指数增长，传统方法难以高效计算策略。

Method: 提出一阶表示方法，将状态和动作空间压缩为多项式大小，并开发了Foreplan关系前向规划器及其近似版本。

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，Foreplan实现了至少四个数量级的加速，并能确定完成任务所需的对象数量。

Conclusion: Foreplan有效解决了状态和动作空间指数爆炸问题，显著提升了决策效率。

Abstract: Decision making is a central problem in AI that can be formalized using a
Markov Decision Process. A problem is that, with increasing numbers of
(indistinguishable) objects, the state space grows exponentially. To compute
policies, the state space has to be enumerated. Even more possibilities have to
be enumerated if the size of the action space depends on the size of the state
space, especially if we allow concurrent actions. To tackle the exponential
blow-up in the action and state space, we present a first-order representation
to store the spaces in polynomial instead of exponential size in the number of
objects and introduce Foreplan, a relational forward planner, which uses this
representation to efficiently compute policies for numerous indistinguishable
objects and actions. Additionally, we introduce an even faster approximate
version of Foreplan. Moreover, Foreplan identifies how many objects an agent
should act on to achieve a certain task given restrictions. Further, we provide
a theoretical analysis and an empirical evaluation of Foreplan, demonstrating a
speedup of at least four orders of magnitude.

Motivation: 研究长链思维（LCoT）的内部结构如何驱动或预测最终答案的正确性，填补这一未充分探索的领域。

Method: 提出LCoT2Tree框架，将顺序LCoT转换为层次树结构，利用图神经网络（GNNs）分析结构模式。

Result: 发现结构模式（如探索、回溯和验证）是最终性能的更强预测因子，并识别导致失败的关键思维模式（如过度分支）。

Conclusion: LCoT2Tree为诊断、解释和改进LLM推理提供了强大工具，强调了推理链内部结构的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have
popularized Long Chain-of-Thought (LCoT), a strategy that encourages deliberate
and step-by-step reasoning before producing a final answer. While LCoTs have
enabled expert-level performance in complex tasks, how the internal structures
of their reasoning chains drive, or even predict, the correctness of final
answers remains a critical yet underexplored question. In this work, we present
LCoT2Tree, an automated framework that converts sequential LCoTs into
hierarchical tree structures and thus enables deeper structural analysis of LLM
reasoning. Using graph neural networks (GNNs), we reveal that structural
patterns extracted by LCoT2Tree, including exploration, backtracking, and
verification, serve as stronger predictors of final performance across a wide
range of tasks and models. Leveraging an explainability technique, we further
identify critical thought patterns such as over-branching that account for
failures. Beyond diagnostic insights, the structural patterns by LCoT2Tree
support practical applications, including improving Best-of-N decoding
effectiveness. Overall, our results underscore the critical role of internal
structures of reasoning chains, positioning LCoT2Tree as a powerful tool for
diagnosing, interpreting, and improving reasoning in LLMs.

Motivation: 现实场景中（如道路网络）的双目标优化问题常存在相关性，传统方法计算复杂度高，需探索更高效的近似解法。

Method: 通过预处理识别图中的相关聚类，生成新的图表示，并改进A*pex算法以利用相关性加速搜索。

Result: 在DIMACS数据集上，改进后的A*pex算法运行速度提升至多5倍，同时保证解的质量。

Conclusion: 该算法首次有效利用目标函数相关性，显著提升双目标搜索效率，并具有理论保证。

Abstract: The bi-objective shortest-path (BOSP) problem seeks to find paths between
start and target vertices of a graph while optimizing two conflicting objective
functions. We consider the BOSP problem in the presence of correlated
objectives. Such correlations often occur in real-world settings such as road
networks, where optimizing two positively correlated objectives, such as travel
time and fuel consumption, is common. BOSP is generally computationally
challenging as the size of the search space is exponential in the number of
objective functions and the graph size. Bounded sub-optimal BOSP solvers such
as A*pex alleviate this complexity by approximating the Pareto-optimal solution
set rather than computing it exactly (given a user-provided approximation
factor). As the correlation between objective functions increases, smaller
approximation factors are sufficient for collapsing the entire Pareto-optimal
set into a single solution. We leverage this insight to propose an efficient
algorithm that reduces the search effort in the presence of correlated
objectives. Our approach for computing approximations of the entire
Pareto-optimal set is inspired by graph-clustering algorithms. It uses a
preprocessing phase to identify correlated clusters within a graph and to
generate a new graph representation. This allows a natural generalization of
A*pex to run up to five times faster on DIMACS dataset instances, a standard
benchmark in the field. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
algorithm proposed that efficiently and effectively exploits correlations in
the context of bi-objective search while providing theoretical guarantees on
solution quality.

Result: 该方法能够高效地权衡压缩与精度，同时提升模型的可解释性。

Conclusion: 层次化方法解决了传统方法中超参数选择和模型不一致的问题，为提升模型构建提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Probabilistic graphical models that encode indistinguishable objects and
relations among them use first-order logic constructs to compress a
propositional factorised model for more efficient (lifted) inference. To obtain
a lifted representation, the state-of-the-art algorithm Advanced Colour Passing
(ACP) groups factors that represent matching distributions. In an approximate
version using $\varepsilon$ as a hyperparameter, factors are grouped that
differ by a factor of at most $(1\pm \varepsilon)$. However, finding a suitable
$\varepsilon$ is not obvious and may need a lot of exploration, possibly
requiring many ACP runs with different $\varepsilon$ values. Additionally,
varying $\varepsilon$ can yield wildly different models, leading to decreased
interpretability. Therefore, this paper presents a hierarchical approach to
lifted model construction that is hyperparameter-free. It efficiently computes
a hierarchy of $\varepsilon$ values that ensures a hierarchy of models, meaning
that once factors are grouped together given some $\varepsilon$, these factors
will be grouped together for larger $\varepsilon$ as well. The hierarchy of
$\varepsilon$ values also leads to a hierarchy of error bounds. This allows for
explicitly weighing compression versus accuracy when choosing specific
$\varepsilon$ values to run ACP with and enables interpretability between the
different models.

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，现有评估范式低估了LLMs的潜力，呼吁重新设计更全面的评估策略以准确衡量其真实能力。

Abstract: Recent research has highlighted that Large Language Models (LLMs), even when
trained to generate extended long reasoning steps, still face significant
challenges on hard reasoning problems. However, much of the existing literature
relies on direct prompting with simple in-context learning examples for
evaluation, which largely overlooks advanced techniques to elicit LLMs'
deliberate reasoning before drawing conclusions that LLMs hit a performance
ceiling. In this paper, we systematically explore the combined potential of
in-context search and test-time scaling on super hard reasoning tasks. We find
that by employing advanced in-context search prompting to LLMs augmented with
internal scaling, one can achieve transformative performance breakthroughs on
tasks previously deemed "unsolvable" (e.g., reported success rates below 5%).
We provide both empirical results and theoretical analysis of how this
combination can unleash LLM reasoning capabilities: i) Empirically, on
controlled NP-hard tasks and complex real-world planning benchmarks, our
approach achieves up to a 30x improvement in success rates compared to
previously reported results without any external mechanisms; ii) Theoretically,
we show that in-context search prompting, when combined with internal scaling,
significantly extends the complexity class of solvable reasoning problems.
These findings challenge prevailing assumptions about the limitations of LLMs
on complex tasks, indicating that current evaluation paradigms systematically
underestimate their true potential. Our work calls for a critical reassessment
of how LLM reasoning is benchmarked and a more robust evaluation strategy that
fully captures the true capabilities of contemporary LLMs, which can lead to a
better understanding of their operational reasoning boundaries in real-world
deployments.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) agents has highlighted
critical challenges in cross-vendor service discovery, interoperability, and
communication. Existing protocols like model context protocol and
agent-to-agent protocol have made significant strides in standardizing
interoperability between agents and tools, as well as communication among
multi-agents. However, there remains a lack of standardized protocols and
solutions for service discovery across different agent and tool vendors. In
this paper, we propose AgentDNS, a root domain naming and service discovery
system designed to enable LLM agents to autonomously discover, resolve, and
securely invoke third-party agent and tool services across organizational and
technological boundaries. Inspired by the principles of the traditional DNS,
AgentDNS introduces a structured mechanism for service registration, semantic
service discovery, secure invocation, and unified billing. We detail the
architecture, core functionalities, and use cases of AgentDNS, demonstrating
its potential to streamline multi-agent collaboration in real-world scenarios.

Result: AIM在多个实际数学课题中表现出色，能自主构建部分证明并发现非平凡见解。

Conclusion: AIM展示了LRMs在数学研究中的潜力，未来可能显著加速数学研究进程。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have made significant progress in mathematical
capabilities in recent times. However, these successes have been primarily
confined to competition-level problems. In this work, we propose AI
Mathematician (AIM) framework, which harnesses the reasoning strength of LRMs
to support frontier mathematical research. We have identified two critical
challenges of mathematical research compared to competition, {\it the intrinsic
complexity of research problems} and {\it the requirement of procedural rigor}.
To address these challenges, AIM incorporates two core strategies: an
exploration mechanism to foster longer solution paths, and the pessimistic
reasonable verification method to ensure reliability.
  This early version of AIM already exhibits strong capability in tackling
research-level tasks. We conducted extensive experiments across several
real-world mathematical topics and obtained promising results. AIM is able to
autonomously construct substantial portions of proofs and uncover non-trivial
insights within each research area. These findings highlight the potential of
LRMs in mathematical discovery and suggest that LRM-based agent systems could
significantly accelerate mathematical research in the future.

Conclusion: HDDLGym是一个有价值的工具，特别适用于多智能体分层规划研究。

Abstract: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been widely tested
using tools like OpenAI Gym, though many tasks in these environments could also
benefit from hierarchical planning. However, there is a lack of a tool that
enables seamless integration of hierarchical planning with RL. Hierarchical
Domain Definition Language (HDDL), used in classical planning, introduces a
structured approach well-suited for model-based RL to address this gap. To
bridge this integration, we introduce HDDLGym, a Python-based tool that
automatically generates OpenAI Gym environments from HDDL domains and problems.
HDDLGym serves as a link between RL and hierarchical planning, supporting
multi-agent scenarios and enabling collaborative planning among agents. This
paper provides an overview of HDDLGym's design and implementation, highlighting
the challenges and design choices involved in integrating HDDL with the Gym
interface, and applying RL policies to support hierarchical planning. We also
provide detailed instructions and demonstrations for using the HDDLGym
framework, including how to work with existing HDDL domains and problems from
International Planning Competitions, exemplified by the Transport domain.
Additionally, we offer guidance on creating new HDDL domains for multi-agent
scenarios and demonstrate the practical use of HDDLGym in the Overcooked
domain. By leveraging the advantages of HDDL and Gym, HDDLGym aims to be a
valuable tool for studying RL in hierarchical planning, particularly in
multi-agent contexts.

Motivation: 随着语言模型能力的提升，传统红队测试方法可能失效，尤其是在目标模型能力超过攻击者时。研究旨在探索这种能力差距对红队测试的影响。

Method: 通过评估500多个攻击者-目标模型对，使用基于LLM的越狱攻击模拟人类红队行为，分析攻击成功率与能力差距的关系。

Result: 发现三个趋势：1）能力更强的模型是更好的攻击者；2）目标能力超过攻击者时攻击成功率骤降；3）攻击成功率与MMLU-Pro基准的社会科学表现相关。

Conclusion: 固定能力的攻击者（如人类）可能对未来的模型无效，开源模型的风险增加，需准确评估模型的操控能力以限制其攻击效果。

Abstract: As large language models grow in capability and agency, identifying
vulnerabilities through red-teaming becomes vital for safe deployment. However,
traditional prompt-engineering approaches may prove ineffective once
red-teaming turns into a weak-to-strong problem, where target models surpass
red-teamers in capabilities. To study this shift, we frame red-teaming through
the lens of the capability gap between attacker and target. We evaluate more
than 500 attacker-target pairs using LLM-based jailbreak attacks that mimic
human red-teamers across diverse families, sizes, and capability levels. Three
strong trends emerge: (i) more capable models are better attackers, (ii) attack
success drops sharply once the target's capability exceeds the attacker's, and
(iii) attack success rates correlate with high performance on social science
splits of the MMLU-Pro benchmark. From these trends, we derive a jailbreaking
scaling law that predicts attack success for a fixed target based on
attacker-target capability gap. These findings suggest that fixed-capability
attackers (e.g., humans) may become ineffective against future models,
increasingly capable open-source models amplify risks for existing systems, and
model providers must accurately measure and control models' persuasive and
manipulative abilities to limit their effectiveness as attackers.

Motivation: 知识图谱（KGs）探索对专家用户仍具挑战性，LLM的应用虽广泛，但其对用户信任、探索策略和决策的影响尚不明确。

Method: 开发LinkQ系统，通过LLM将自然语言问题转为结构化查询，并设计五种视觉机制帮助用户评估准确性。

Result: 用户（包括KG专家）倾向于过度信任系统输出，工作流因背景知识不同而异，挑战了“通用设计”假设。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM辅助工具中虚假信任的风险，需进一步探索可视化作为缓解技术的作用。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful data structures, but exploring them
effectively remains difficult for even expert users. Large language models
(LLMs) are increasingly used to address this gap, yet little is known
empirically about how their usage with KGs shapes user trust, exploration
strategies, or downstream decision-making - raising key design challenges for
LLM-based KG visual analysis systems. To study these effects, we developed
LinkQ, a KG exploration system that converts natural language questions into
structured queries with an LLM. We collaborated with KG experts to design five
visual mechanisms that help users assess the accuracy of both KG queries and
LLM responses: an LLM-KG state diagram that illustrates which stage of the
exploration pipeline LinkQ is in, a query editor displaying the generated query
paired with an LLM explanation, an entity-relation ID table showing extracted
KG entities and relations with semantic descriptions, a query structure graph
that depicts the path traversed in the KG, and an interactive graph
visualization of query results. From a qualitative evaluation with 14
practitioners, we found that users - even KG experts - tended to overtrust
LinkQ's outputs due to its "helpful" visualizations, even when the LLM was
incorrect. Users exhibited distinct workflows depending on their prior
familiarity with KGs and LLMs, challenging the assumption that these systems
are one-size-fits-all - despite often being designed as if they are. Our
findings highlight the risks of false trust in LLM-assisted data analysis tools
and the need for further investigation into the role of visualization as a
mitigation technique.

Abstract: We introduce SIMCOPILOT, a benchmark that simulates the role of large
language models (LLMs) as interactive, "copilot"-style coding assistants.
Targeting both completion (finishing incomplete methods or code blocks) and
infill tasks (filling missing segments within existing code), SIMCOPILOT
provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM coding capabilities. The
benchmark comprises dedicated sub-benchmarks for Java (SIMCOPILOTJ) and Python
(SIMCOPILOTP), covering diverse codebases varying in size and complexity. Our
key contributions include: (a) establishing a realistic, detailed evaluation
environment to assess LLM utility in practical coding scenarios, and (b)
providing fine-grained analyses that address critical factors frequently
overlooked by existing benchmarks, such as task-specific performance nuances,
contextual understanding across code segments, and sensitivity to variable
scope. Evaluations conducted across domains-including algorithms, databases,
computer vision, and neural networks-offer insights into model strengths and
highlight persistent challenges in maintaining logical consistency within
complex dependency structures. Beyond benchmarking, our study sheds light on
the current limitations of LLM-driven code generation and underscores the
ongoing transition of LLMs from merely syntax-aware generators toward reliable,
intelligent software development partners.

Result: 在三个真实时间序列数据集上验证了TERSE的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: TERSE首次同时考虑时空一致性，可作为插件模块增强现有SFDA方法。

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a pre-trained model from
an annotated source domain to an unlabelled target domain without accessing the
source data, thereby preserving data privacy. While existing SFDA methods have
proven effective in reducing reliance on source data, they struggle to perform
well on multivariate time series (MTS) due to their failure to consider the
intrinsic spatial correlations inherent in MTS data. These spatial correlations
are crucial for accurately representing MTS data and preserving invariant
information across domains. To address this challenge, we propose Temporal
Restoration and Spatial Rewiring (TERSE), a novel and concise SFDA method
tailored for MTS data. Specifically, TERSE comprises a customized
spatial-temporal feature encoder designed to capture the underlying
spatial-temporal characteristics, coupled with both temporal restoration and
spatial rewiring tasks to reinstate latent representations of the temporally
masked time series and the spatially masked correlated structures. During the
target adaptation phase, the target encoder is guided to produce spatially and
temporally consistent features with the source domain by leveraging the source
pre-trained temporal restoration and spatial rewiring networks. Therefore,
TERSE can effectively model and transfer spatial-temporal dependencies across
domains, facilitating implicit feature alignment. In addition, as the first
approach to simultaneously consider spatial-temporal consistency in MTS-SFDA,
TERSE can also be integrated as a versatile plug-and-play module into
established SFDA methods. Extensive experiments on three real-world time series
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated the ability to
improve performance in chemistry-related tasks by selecting appropriate tools.
However, their effectiveness remains limited by the inherent prediction errors
of chemistry tools. In this paper, we take a step further by exploring how
LLMbased agents can, in turn, be leveraged to reduce prediction errors of the
tools. To this end, we propose ChemHAS (Chemical Hierarchical Agent Stacking),
a simple yet effective method that enhances chemistry tools through optimizing
agent-stacking structures from limited data. ChemHAS achieves state-of-the-art
performance across four fundamental chemistry tasks, demonstrating that our
method can effectively compensate for prediction errors of the tools.
Furthermore, we identify and characterize four distinct agent-stacking

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动调制识别方法难以满足实时需求，而现有深度学习模型因计算量大难以部署在资源受限设备上。

Method: FCOS采用两阶段剪枝：通道级剪枝通过聚类和参数融合实现，层折叠诊断模块识别并移除折叠层。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，FCOS显著减少了计算量和参数，同时保持了接近原始模型的性能。

Conclusion: FCOS是一种高效的剪枝方法，适用于资源受限环境下的自动调制识别。

Abstract: With the rapid development of wireless communications and the growing
complexity of digital modulation schemes, traditional manual modulation
recognition methods struggle to extract reliable signal features and meet
real-time requirements in modern scenarios. Recently, deep learning based
Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) approaches have greatly improved
classification accuracy. However, their large model sizes and high
computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained devices. Model
pruning provides a general approach to reduce model complexity, but existing
weight, channel, and layer pruning techniques each present a trade-off between
compression rate, hardware acceleration, and accuracy preservation. To this
end, in this paper, we introduce FCOS, a novel Fine-to-COarse two-Stage pruning
framework that combines channel-level pruning with layer-level collapse
diagnosis to achieve extreme compression, high performance and efficient
inference. In the first stage of FCOS, hierarchical clustering and parameter
fusion are applied to channel weights to achieve channel-level pruning. Then a
Layer Collapse Diagnosis (LaCD) module uses linear probing to identify layer
collapse and removes the collapsed layers due to high channel compression
ratio. Experiments on multiple AMR benchmarks demonstrate that FCOS outperforms
existing channel and layer pruning methods. Specifically, FCOS achieves 95.51%
FLOPs reduction and 95.31% parameter reduction while still maintaining
performance close to the original ResNet56, with only a 0.46% drop in accuracy
on Sig2019-12. Code is available at https://github.com/yaolu-zjut/FCOS.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SINO是一种新型的谱启发神经算子框架，能够从少量轨迹数据中学习PDE算子，无需已知PDE项，并在多个PDE基准测试中取得最优结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值求解器需要精细离散化和完整的PDE知识，而数据驱动的神经PDE求解器需要大量训练数据。SINO旨在解决这些限制，尤其是在数据稀缺或PDE未知的情况下。

Method: SINO在频域中操作，引入频率到向量模块学习谱表示，设计了非线性算子块（包括低通滤波的Π块）以防止混叠，并采用算子蒸馏技术进行高效推理。

Result: SINO在多个PDE基准测试中表现优异，具有强离散不变性和对分布外初始条件的鲁棒性，并能准确模拟全局耦合系统（如Navier-Stokes方程）。

Conclusion: SINO是首个无需显式PDE项即可从有限数据中准确模拟全局耦合系统的物理感知方法，为PDE求解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) govern the spatiotemporal evolution of
various physical systems. Classical numerical solvers, while accurate, require
fine discretization and full knowledge of the governing PDEs, limiting their
applicability when the physics is unknown or fast inference is required.
Data-driven neural PDE solvers alleviate these constraints by learning from
data but demand large training datasets and perform poorly in data-scarce
regimes. Physics-aware methods mitigate data requirements by incorporating
physical knowledge yet rely on known PDE terms or local numerical schemes,
restricting their ability to handle unknown or globally coupled systems. In
this work, we propose the Spectral-inspired Neural Operator (SINO), a novel
framework that learns PDE operators from limited trajectories (as few as 2-5),
without any known PDE terms. SINO operates in the frequency domain and
introduces a Frequency-to-Vector module to learn spectral representations
analogous to derivative multipliers. To model nonlinear physical interactions,
we design a nonlinear operator block that includes a $\Pi$-Block with low-pass
filtering to prevent aliasing. Finally, we introduce an operator distillation
technique to distill the trained model for efficient inference. SINO achieves
state-of-the-art results across multiple PDE benchmarks, demonstrating strong
discretization invariance and robust generalization to out-of-distribution
initial conditions. To our knowledge, SINO is the first physics-aware method
capable of accurately simulating globally coupled systems (e.g., the
Navier-Stokes equations) from limited data without any explicit PDE terms.

### [297] [Concentration Distribution Learning from Label Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21576)
*Jiawei Tang,Yuheng Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的标签分布学习方法，通过引入背景浓度概念，解决了传统标签分布学习中忽略标签绝对强度的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标签分布学习（LDL）仅关注标签的相对描述度，忽略了标签的绝对强度，导致信息丢失和实例混淆。

Method: 提出背景浓度概念作为标签分布的绝对描述度项，结合概率方法和神经网络模型，从现有LDL数据集中学习标签分布和背景浓度。

Result: 实验证明，该方法能有效提取背景浓度，并在预测结果上优于现有LDL方法。

Conclusion: 改进的浓度分布学习范式（CDL-LD）通过引入背景浓度，显著提升了标签分布学习的准确性和信息完整性。

Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) is an effective method to predict the
relative label description degree (a.k.a. label distribution) of a sample.
However, the label distribution is not a complete representation of an instance
because it overlooks the absolute intensity of each label. Specifically, it's
impossible to obtain the total description degree of hidden labels that not in
the label space, which leads to the loss of information and confusion in
instances. To solve the above problem, we come up with a new concept named
background concentration to serve as the absolute description degree term of
the label distribution and introduce it into the LDL process, forming the
improved paradigm of concentration distribution learning. Moreover, we propose
a novel model by probabilistic methods and neural networks to learn label
distributions and background concentrations from existing LDL datasets.
Extensive experiments prove that the proposed approach is able to extract
background concentrations from label distributions while producing more
accurate prediction results than the state-of-the-art LDL methods. The code is
available in https://github.com/seutjw/CDL-LD.

Conclusion: 建议未来研究应更全面、情境感知和负责任，以促进联邦学习公平性的实际应用。

Abstract: Fairness in federated learning has emerged as a rapidly growing area of
research, with numerous works proposing formal definitions and algorithmic
interventions. Yet, despite this technical progress, fairness in FL is often
defined and evaluated in ways that abstract away from the sociotechnical
contexts in which these systems are deployed. In this paper, we argue that
existing approaches tend to optimize narrow system level metrics, such as
performance parity or contribution-based rewards, while overlooking how harms
arise throughout the FL lifecycle and how they impact diverse stakeholders. We
support this claim through a critical analysis of the literature, based on a
systematic annotation of papers for their fairness definitions, design
decisions, evaluation practices, and motivating use cases. Our analysis reveals
five recurring pitfalls: 1) fairness framed solely through the lens of server
client architecture, 2) a mismatch between simulations and motivating use-cases
and contexts, 3) definitions that conflate protecting the system with
protecting its users, 4) interventions that target isolated stages of the
lifecycle while neglecting upstream and downstream effects, 5) and a lack of
multi-stakeholder alignment where multiple fairness definitions can be relevant
at once. Building on these insights, we propose a harm centered framework that
links fairness definitions to concrete risks and stakeholder vulnerabilities.
We conclude with recommendations for more holistic, context-aware, and
accountable fairness research in FL.

Result: CellCLAT在自监督图学习任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CellCLAT为蜂窝复合体的自监督学习提供了有效解决方案，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Self-supervised topological deep learning (TDL) represents a nascent but
underexplored area with significant potential for modeling higher-order
interactions in simplicial complexes and cellular complexes to derive
representations of unlabeled graphs. Compared to simplicial complexes, cellular
complexes exhibit greater expressive power. However, the advancement in
self-supervised learning for cellular TDL is largely hindered by two core
challenges: \textit{extrinsic structural constraints} inherent to cellular
complexes, and intrinsic semantic redundancy in cellular representations. The
first challenge highlights that traditional graph augmentation techniques may
compromise the integrity of higher-order cellular interactions, while the
second underscores that topological redundancy in cellular complexes
potentially diminish task-relevant information. To address these issues, we
introduce Cellular Complex Contrastive Learning with Adaptive Trimming
(CellCLAT), a twofold framework designed to adhere to the combinatorial
constraints of cellular complexes while mitigating informational redundancy.
Specifically, we propose a parameter perturbation-based augmentation method
that injects controlled noise into cellular interactions without altering the
underlying cellular structures, thereby preserving cellular topology during
contrastive learning. Additionally, a cellular trimming scheduler is employed
to mask gradient contributions from task-irrelevant cells through a bi-level
meta-learning approach, effectively removing redundant topological elements
while maintaining critical higher-order semantics. We provide theoretical
justification and empirical validation to demonstrate that CellCLAT achieves
substantial improvements over existing self-supervised graph learning methods,
marking a significant attempt in this domain.

Result: 实验表明，MSFP在4位浮点量化中首次实现了优于现有PTQ微调方法的性能。

Conclusion: MSFP框架为扩散模型的低比特量化提供了稳定且高效的解决方案，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Model quantization reduces the bit-width of weights and activations,
improving memory efficiency and inference speed in diffusion models. However,
achieving 4-bit quantization remains challenging. Existing methods, primarily
based on integer quantization and post-training quantization fine-tuning,
struggle with inconsistent performance. Inspired by the success of
floating-point (FP) quantization in large language models, we explore low-bit
FP quantization for diffusion models and identify key challenges: the failure
of signed FP quantization to handle asymmetric activation distributions, the
insufficient consideration of temporal complexity in the denoising process
during fine-tuning, and the misalignment between fine-tuning loss and
quantization error. To address these challenges, we propose the mixup-sign
floating-point quantization (MSFP) framework, first introducing unsigned FP
quantization in model quantization, along with timestep-aware LoRA (TALoRA) and
denoising-factor loss alignment (DFA), which ensure precise and stable
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that we are the first to achieve
superior performance in 4-bit FP quantization for diffusion models,
outperforming existing PTQ fine-tuning methods in 4-bit INT quantization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有数据增强方法（如随机遮挡）未能针对模型决策关键区域的不足。

Method: 提出Relevance-driven Input Dropout (RelDrop)，选择性遮挡输入中最相关的区域，促使模型利用其他重要特征。

Result: 实验表明，RelDrop提高了模型对遮挡的鲁棒性，并改善了推理时的泛化性能。

Conclusion: RelDrop是一种有效的数据增强方法，通过针对性遮挡提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Overfitting is a well-known issue extending even to state-of-the-art (SOTA)
Machine Learning (ML) models, resulting in reduced generalization, and a
significant train-test performance gap. Mitigation measures include a
combination of dropout, data augmentation, weight decay, and other
regularization techniques. Among the various data augmentation strategies,
occlusion is a prominent technique that typically focuses on randomly masking
regions of the input during training. Most of the existing literature
emphasizes randomness in selecting and modifying the input features instead of
regions that strongly influence model decisions. We propose Relevance-driven
Input Dropout (RelDrop), a novel data augmentation method which selectively
occludes the most relevant regions of the input, nudging the model to use other
important features in the prediction process, thus improving model
generalization through informed regularization. We further conduct qualitative
and quantitative analyses to study how Relevance-driven Input Dropout (RelDrop)
affects model decision-making. Through a series of experiments on benchmark
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach improves robustness towards
occlusion, results in models utilizing more features within the region of
interest, and boosts inference time generalization performance. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全基准未能充分评估模型在知识密集型危险场景中的表现，存在显著的安全对齐缺陷。

Method: 开发了SOSBench，包含3,000个基于真实法规的提示，通过LLM辅助的进化管道生成多样化的滥用场景。

Result: 前沿模型在所有领域均表现出高比例的违规内容（如Deepseek-R1为79.1%，GPT-4.1为47.3%）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在安全对齐方面的严重不足，强调了负责任部署的紧迫性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit advancing capabilities in complex tasks,
such as reasoning and graduate-level question answering, yet their resilience
against misuse, particularly involving scientifically sophisticated risks,
remains underexplored. Existing safety benchmarks typically focus either on
instructions requiring minimal knowledge comprehension (e.g., ``tell me how to
build a bomb") or utilize prompts that are relatively low-risk (e.g.,
multiple-choice or classification tasks about hazardous content). Consequently,
they fail to adequately assess model safety when handling knowledge-intensive,
hazardous scenarios.
  To address this critical gap, we introduce SOSBench, a regulation-grounded,
hazard-focused benchmark encompassing six high-risk scientific domains:
chemistry, biology, medicine, pharmacology, physics, and psychology. The
benchmark comprises 3,000 prompts derived from real-world regulations and laws,
systematically expanded via an LLM-assisted evolutionary pipeline that
introduces diverse, realistic misuse scenarios (e.g., detailed explosive
synthesis instructions involving advanced chemical formulas). We evaluate
frontier models within a unified evaluation framework using our SOSBench.
Despite their alignment claims, advanced models consistently disclose
policy-violating content across all domains, demonstrating alarmingly high
rates of harmful responses (e.g., 79.1% for Deepseek-R1 and 47.3% for GPT-4.1).
These results highlight significant safety alignment deficiencies and
underscore urgent concerns regarding the responsible deployment of powerful
LLMs.

Result: 实验表明，提出的方法显著优于固定分布的经典经验风险最小化。

Conclusion: 分布感知训练是提升OOD泛化的有效框架。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a fundamental challenge in
machine learning. Models trained on one data distribution often experience
substantial performance degradation when evaluated on shifted or unseen
domains. To address this challenge, the present paper studies the design of
training data distributions that maximize average-case OOD performance. First,
a theoretical analysis establishes a family of generalization bounds that
quantify how the choice of training distribution influences OOD error across a
predefined family of target distributions. These insights motivate the
introduction of two complementary algorithmic strategies: (i) directly
formulating OOD risk minimization as a bilevel optimization problem over the
space of probability measures and (ii) minimizing a theoretical upper bound on
OOD error. Last, the paper evaluates the two approaches across a range of
function approximation and operator learning examples. The proposed methods
significantly improve OOD accuracy over standard empirical risk minimization
with a fixed distribution. These results highlight the potential of
distribution-aware training as a principled and practical framework for robust
OOD generalization.

Conclusion: 提出的框架统一了IRL、IO和AL，正则化解决了IRL的不适定性，SMD提供了高效求解方法。

Abstract: The relationship between inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and inverse
optimization (IO) for Markov decision processes (MDPs) has been relatively
underexplored in the literature, despite addressing the same problem. In this
work, we revisit the relationship between the IO framework for MDPs, IRL, and
apprenticeship learning (AL). We incorporate prior beliefs on the structure of
the cost function into the IRL and AL problems, and demonstrate that the
convex-analytic view of the AL formalism (Kamoutsi et al., 2021) emerges as a
relaxation of our framework. Notably, the AL formalism is a special case in our
framework when the regularization term is absent. Focusing on the suboptimal
expert setting, we formulate the AL problem as a regularized min-max problem.
The regularizer plays a key role in addressing the ill-posedness of IRL by
guiding the search for plausible cost functions. To solve the resulting
regularized-convex-concave-min-max problem, we use stochastic mirror descent
(SMD) and establish convergence bounds for the proposed method. Numerical
experiments highlight the critical role of regularization in learning cost
vectors and apprentice policies.

Result: 训练步骤复杂度降至O(1)梯度评估和近线性算术运算，样本生成更高效且质量更高。

Conclusion: 新模型在对称流形上显著优于现有方法，为高效扩散建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce a framework for designing efficient diffusion models for
$d$-dimensional symmetric-space Riemannian manifolds, including the torus,
sphere, special orthogonal group and unitary group. Existing manifold diffusion
models often depend on heat kernels, which lack closed-form expressions and
require either $d$ gradient evaluations or exponential-in-$d$ arithmetic
operations per training step. We introduce a new diffusion model for symmetric
manifolds with a spatially-varying covariance, allowing us to leverage a
projection of Euclidean Brownian motion to bypass heat kernel computations. Our
training algorithm minimizes a novel efficient objective derived via Ito's
Lemma, allowing each step to run in $O(1)$ gradient evaluations and
nearly-linear-in-$d$ ($O(d^{1.19})$) arithmetic operations, reducing the gap
between diffusions on symmetric manifolds and Euclidean space. Manifold
symmetries ensure the diffusion satisfies an "average-case" Lipschitz
condition, enabling accurate and efficient sample generation. Empirically, our
model outperforms prior methods in training speed and improves sample quality
on synthetic datasets on the torus, special orthogonal group, and unitary
group.

Motivation: 在医学等安全关键应用中，需要可靠的ATE推断，但数据隐私保护是重要挑战。

Method: PrivATE通过三步实现：差分私有ATE估计、差分私有方差估计和CI构建。

Result: 框架在合成和真实医学数据集上有效，首次实现了差分隐私下ATE的通用、双重稳健CI。

Conclusion: PrivATE为差分隐私下的ATE推断提供了有效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: The average treatment effect (ATE) is widely used to evaluate the
effectiveness of drugs and other medical interventions. In safety-critical
applications like medicine, reliable inferences about the ATE typically require
valid uncertainty quantification, such as through confidence intervals (CIs).
However, estimating treatment effects in these settings often involves
sensitive data that must be kept private. In this work, we present PrivATE, a
novel machine learning framework for computing CIs for the ATE under
differential privacy. Specifically, we focus on deriving valid
privacy-preserving CIs for the ATE from observational data. Our PrivATE
framework consists of three steps: (i) estimating a differentially private ATE
through output perturbation; (ii) estimating the differentially private
variance through a truncated output perturbation mechanism; and (iii)
constructing the CIs while accounting for the uncertainty from both the
estimation and privatization steps. Our PrivATE framework is model agnostic,
doubly robust, and ensures valid CIs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework using synthetic and real-world medical datasets. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to derive a general, doubly robust framework for
valid CIs of the ATE under ($\varepsilon$, $\delta$)-differential privacy.

Abstract: The learning rate is an important tuning parameter for stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) and can greatly influence its performance. However, appropriate
selection of a learning rate schedule across all iterations typically requires
a non-trivial amount of user tuning effort. To address this, we introduce
AutoSGD: an SGD method that automatically determines whether to increase or
decrease the learning rate at a given iteration and then takes appropriate
action. We introduce theory supporting the convergence of AutoSGD, along with
its deterministic counterpart for standard gradient descent. Empirical results
suggest strong performance of the method on a variety of traditional
optimization problems and machine learning tasks.

Motivation: 现有自动化工具生成的演示文稿在布局、文本摘要和图像理解上存在问题，限制了其在正式场景（如商业和科研）中的应用。PreGenie旨在解决这些问题。

Method: PreGenie基于Slidev框架，分两阶段工作：分析与初始生成（总结多模态输入并生成初始代码）和审查与重新生成（迭代优化代码和幻灯片）。

Result: 实验表明，PreGenie在多模态理解和内容一致性上优于现有模型，且更符合人类设计偏好。

Conclusion: PreGenie通过模块化和多阶段优化，显著提升了自动化生成演示文稿的质量和适用性。

Abstract: Visual presentations are vital for effective communication. Early attempts to
automate their creation using deep learning often faced issues such as poorly
organized layouts, inaccurate text summarization, and a lack of image
understanding, leading to mismatched visuals and text. These limitations
restrict their application in formal contexts like business and scientific
research. To address these challenges, we propose PreGenie, an agentic and
modular framework powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for
generating high-quality visual presentations.
  PreGenie is built on the Slidev presentation framework, where slides are
rendered from Markdown code. It operates in two stages: (1) Analysis and
Initial Generation, which summarizes multimodal input and generates initial
code, and (2) Review and Re-generation, which iteratively reviews intermediate
code and rendered slides to produce final, high-quality presentations. Each
stage leverages multiple MLLMs that collaborate and share information.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PreGenie excels in multimodal
understanding, outperforming existing models in both aesthetics and content
consistency, while aligning more closely with human design preferences.

Abstract: The controllable generation of diffusion models aims to steer the model to
generate samples that optimize some given objective functions. It is desirable
for a variety of applications including image generation, molecule generation,
and DNA/sequence generation. Reinforcement Learning (RL) based fine-tuning of
the base model is a popular approach but it can overfit the reward function
while requiring significant resources. We frame controllable generation as a
problem of finding a distribution that optimizes a KL-regularized objective
function. We present SLCD -- Supervised Learning based Controllable Diffusion,
which iteratively generates online data and trains a small classifier to guide
the generation of the diffusion model. Similar to the standard
classifier-guided diffusion, SLCD's key computation primitive is classification
and does not involve any complex concepts from RL or control. Via a reduction
to no-regret online learning analysis, we show that under KL divergence, the
output from SLCD provably converges to the optimal solution of the
KL-regularized objective. Further, we empirically demonstrate that SLCD can
generate high quality samples with nearly the same inference time as the base

*Hung Ahn Vu,Galen Reeves,Emily Wenger*

TL;DR: 研究探讨了生成AI模型通过互联网相互训练的影响，发现这种数据交互可能带来新概念但也可能导致性能同质化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社会对生成AI工具的依赖增加，理解模型间数据交互的下游效应至关重要。

Method: 通过实证研究和理论模型分析数据交互的实践过程，并实验验证长期结果。

Result: 数据交互可能使模型接触到新概念，但也可能导致任务性能同质化。

Conclusion: 数据交互对生成AI模型的影响具有双面性，需进一步研究其长期效应。

Abstract: The internet is full of AI-generated content while also serving as a common
source of training data for generative AI (genAI) models. This duality raises
the possibility that future genAI models may be trained on other models'
generated outputs. Prior work has studied consequences of models training on
their own generated outputs, but limited work has considered what happens if
models ingest content produced by other models. Given society's increasing
dependence on genAI tools, understanding downstream effects of such
data-mediated model interactions is critical. To this end, we provide empirical
evidence for how data-mediated interactions might unfold in practice, develop a
theoretical model for this interactive training process, and show
experimentally possible long-term results of such interactions. We find that
data-mediated interactions can benefit models by exposing them to novel
concepts perhaps missed in original training data, but also can homogenize
their performance on shared tasks.

TL;DR: 提出multivariateGPT，一种用于混合类别和数值数据的单一架构，通过自回归序列分解、嵌入方案和损失函数扩展了Transformer模型的适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据常混合类别和数值，且记录间隔不规则。现有方法在数值表示或类别处理上存在局限。

Method: 采用自回归序列分解、嵌入方案和联合分布似然估计的损失函数，扩展Transformer模型。

Result: 在简单物理系统和复杂时间序列（如心电图和电子健康记录数据）中表现出高效学习和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 扩展了Transformer模型在混合数据类型上的应用范围。

Abstract: Real-world processes often generate data that are a mix of categorical and
numeric values that are recorded at irregular and informative intervals.
Discrete token-based approaches are limited in numeric representation capacity
while methods like neural ordinary differential equations are not well suited
for categorical data or informative sampling and require augmentation to handle
certain classes of trajectories. Here, we present multivariateGPT, a single
architecture for modeling sequences of mixed categorical (including tokenized
text) and numeric data. This is accomplished with an autoregressive sequence
decomposition, embedding scheme, and loss function that extend the next token
prediction task to likelihood estimation of the joint distribution of next
token class and value. We demonstrate how this approach can efficiently learn
to generalize patterns in simple physical systems and model complex time series
including electrocardiograms and multivariate electronic health record data.
This work extends the utility of transformer based models to additional classes
of data.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Gauntlet的激励系统，用于分布式深度学习基础模型的训练，通过奖励贡献者实现完全无需许可的参与。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分布式深度学习中如何激励参与者贡献资源的问题，同时确保训练过程的可靠性和效率。

Method: 采用两阶段机制快速筛选参与者的可靠性，结合损失估计和OpenSkill评分系统，并引入新机制确保计算的唯一性。

Result: 成功训练了一个1.2B参数的LLM模型，并通过实际代币奖励验证了激励系统的有效性。

Conclusion: Gauntlet系统在无需许可的分布式训练中表现出色，为类似场景提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We describe an incentive system for distributed deep learning of foundational
models where peers are rewarded for contributions. The incentive system,
\textit{Gauntlet}, has been deployed on the bittensor blockchain and used to
train a 1.2B LLM with completely permissionless contributions of
pseudo-gradients: no control over the users that can register or their
hardware. \textit{Gauntlet} can be applied to any synchronous distributed
training scheme that relies on aggregating updates or pseudo-gradients. We rely
on a two-stage mechanism for fast filtering of peer uptime, reliability, and
synchronization, combined with the core component that estimates the loss
before and after individual pseudo-gradient contributions. We utilized an
OpenSkill rating system to track competitiveness of pseudo-gradient scores
across time. Finally, we introduce a novel mechanism to ensure peers on the
network perform unique computations. Our live 1.2B run, which has paid out
real-valued tokens to participants based on the value of their contributions,
yielded a competitive (on a per-iteration basis) 1.2B model that demonstrates
the utility of our incentive system.

Motivation: 联邦学习在通信效率和模型准确性之间面临挑战，尤其是如何在不增加计算成本的情况下近似更新误差。

Method: 提出了Gradient Difference Approximation (GDA)方法，利用一阶信息估计局部误差趋势。

Result: GDA成为Adaptive Multi-Step Federated Learning (AMSFL)框架的关键组件，为大规模多步自适应训练环境提供了统一的误差建模策略。

Conclusion: GDA方法在保持轻量级的同时，有效解决了联邦学习中的误差估计问题。

Abstract: Federated learning faces critical challenges in balancing communication
efficiency and model accuracy. One key issue lies in the approximation of
update errors without incurring high computational costs. In this paper, we
propose a lightweight yet effective method called Gradient Difference
Approximation (GDA), which leverages first-order information to estimate local
error trends without computing the full Hessian matrix. The proposed method
forms a key component of the Adaptive Multi-Step Federated Learning (AMSFL)
framework and provides a unified error modeling strategy for large-scale
multi-step adaptive training environments.

TL;DR: LrcSSM是一种非线性循环模型，处理长序列速度与线性状态空间层相当，通过并行计算和梯度稳定性保证，优于其他模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长序列处理中线性状态空间层的效率问题，同时提供梯度稳定性保证。

Method: 强制状态转移矩阵为对角矩阵，每一步动态学习，实现并行计算，降低时间和内存开销。

Result: 在长序列预测任务中，LrcSSM优于LRU、S5和Mamba。

Conclusion: LrcSSM在效率和性能上优于现有模型，适用于长序列处理。

Abstract: We present LrcSSM, a \textit{nonlinear} recurrent model that processes long
sequences as fast as today's linear state-space layers. By forcing the
state-transition matrix to be diagonal and learned at every step, the full
sequence can be solved in parallel with a single prefix-scan, giving
$\mathcal{O}(TD)$ time and memory and only $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ sequential
depth, for input-sequence length $T$ and a state dimension $D$. Moreover,
LrcSSM offers a formal gradient-stability guarantee that other input-varying
systems such as Liquid-S4 and Mamba do not provide. Lastly, for network depth
$L$, as the forward and backward passes cost $\Theta(T\,D\,L)$ FLOPs, with its
low sequential depth and parameter count $\Theta(D\,L)$, the model follows the
compute-optimal scaling law regime ($\beta \approx 0.42$) recently observed for
Mamba, outperforming quadratic-attention Transformers at equal compute while
avoiding the memory overhead of FFT-based long convolutions. We show that on a
series of long-range forecasting tasks, LrcSSM outperforms LRU, S5 and Mamba.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨GD在初始化阶段如何逃离参数空间中的鞍点，特别是低秩偏置对逃离方向的影响。

Method: 分析逃离方向的性质，证明深层权重矩阵的第一奇异值显著大于其他奇异值。

Result: 最优逃离方向在深层表现出低秩偏置，第一奇异值比其他奇异值大至少ℓ^(1/4)倍。

Conclusion: 这是证明深度ReLU网络中GD经历一系列鞍点动态的第一步，未来可研究鞍点到鞍点的动态过程。

Abstract: When a deep ReLU network is initialized with small weights, GD is at first
dominated by the saddle at the origin in parameter space. We study the
so-called escape directions, which play a similar role as the eigenvectors of
the Hessian for strict saddles. We show that the optimal escape direction
features a low-rank bias in its deeper layers: the first singular value of the
$\ell$-th layer weight matrix is at least $\ell^{\frac{1}{4}}$ larger than any
other singular value. We also prove a number of related results about these
escape directions. We argue that this result is a first step in proving
Saddle-to-Saddle dynamics in deep ReLU networks, where GD visits a sequence of
saddles with increasing bottleneck rank.

Method: 引入HackAtari，一组Arcade Learning Environment的任务变体，用于测试RL智能体在简化任务中的表现。

Result: RL智能体在简化任务中表现显著下降，依赖捷径，与人类行为形成鲜明对比。

Conclusion: 静态评估协议不足以实现人类智能水平的RL智能体，需新基准和方法以测试系统性泛化。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents achieve impressive results in a wide
variety of tasks, but they lack zero-shot adaptation capabilities. While most
robustness evaluations focus on tasks complexifications, for which human also
struggle to maintain performances, no evaluation has been performed on tasks
simplifications. To tackle this issue, we introduce HackAtari, a set of task
variations of the Arcade Learning Environments. We use it to demonstrate that,
contrary to humans, RL agents systematically exhibit huge performance drops on
simpler versions of their training tasks, uncovering agents' consistent
reliance on shortcuts. Our analysis across multiple algorithms and
architectures highlights the persistent gap between RL agents and human
behavioral intelligence, underscoring the need for new benchmarks and
methodologies that enforce systematic generalization testing beyond static
evaluation protocols. Training and testing in the same environment is not
enough to obtain agents equipped with human-like intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型训练成本高，低秩分解虽参数高效但性能受限，需改进。

Method: 提出LaX模块，支持低秩子空间信息流，验证于ViT和LLaMA模型。

Result: LaX使低秩模型性能匹配或超越全秩基线，参数减少2-3倍；在LLaMA微调中性能提升。

Conclusion: LaX高效提升低秩模型性能，适用于大规模预训练和微调。

Abstract: Training foundation models such as ViTs and LLMs requires tremendous
computing cost. Low-rank matrix or tensor factorization offers a
parameter-efficient alternative, but often downgrades performance due to the
restricted parameter space. In this work, we introduce {\textbf{Latent Crossing
(LaX)}} -- a simple yet effective plug-and-play module that enhances the
capacity of low-rank models by enabling information flow across low-rank
subspaces. We extensively validate the benefits of LaX on pre-training tasks
with ViT-Base/Large and LLaMA-like models ranging from 60M to 1B parameters.
LaX boosts low-rank model performance to match or exceed the full-rank
baselines while using 2-3\(\times\) fewer parameters. When equipped with
low-rank adapters (i.e., LoRA) for fine-tuning LLaMA-7/13B, LaX consistently
improves performance on arithmetic and common sense reasoning tasks with
negligible cost.

Motivation: 解决交通安全的根本数据悖论：最需要预防的事故往往罕见且数据稀疏，现有方法难以有效应对。

Method: 结合生成场景引擎、多样化驾驶员模型和因果学习，合成和分析近失事件，构建数字孪生测试平台。

Result: 将稀疏事故数据转化为预测信号，支持车辆、道路和政策的压力测试，实现从被动分析到主动预防的转变。

Conclusion: 通过反事实安全学习，推动交通安全的范式转变，助力实现零死亡愿景（Vision Zero）。

Abstract: Traffic safety science has long been hindered by a fundamental data paradox:
the crashes we most wish to prevent are precisely those events we rarely
observe. Existing crash-frequency models and surrogate safety metrics rely
heavily on sparse, noisy, and under-reported records, while even sophisticated,
high-fidelity simulations undersample the long-tailed situations that trigger
catastrophic outcomes such as fatalities. We argue that the path to achieving
Vision Zero, i.e., the complete elimination of traffic fatalities and severe
injuries, requires a paradigm shift from traditional crash-only learning to a
new form of counterfactual safety learning: reasoning not only about what
happened, but also about the vast set of plausible yet perilous scenarios that
could have happened under slightly different circumstances. To operationalize
this shift, our proposed agenda bridges macro to micro. Guided by crash-rate
priors, generative scene engines, diverse driver models, and causal learning,
near-miss events are synthesized and explained. A crash-focused digital twin
testbed links micro scenes to macro patterns, while a multi-objective validator
ensures that simulations maintain statistical realism. This pipeline transforms
sparse crash data into rich signals for crash prediction, enabling the
stress-testing of vehicles, roads, and policies before deployment. By learning
from crashes that almost happened, we can shift traffic safety from reactive
forensics to proactive prevention, advancing Vision Zero.

Motivation: 研究动机在于重新审视隐藏单元在计算中的主动作用，而非仅作为被动记忆存储。

Method: 采用双线性操作（隐藏单元与输入嵌入的乘法交互）作为方法，理论结合实验验证其在状态跟踪任务中的有效性。

Result: 结果表明双线性状态更新形成自然层次结构，对应复杂度递增的任务，线性循环网络（如Mamba）位于最低复杂度层级。

Conclusion: 结论指出双线性操作为隐藏状态演化的自然归纳偏置，为复杂任务提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The role of hidden units in recurrent neural networks is typically seen as
modeling memory, with research focusing on enhancing information retention
through gating mechanisms. A less explored perspective views hidden units as
active participants in the computation performed by the network, rather than
passive memory stores. In this work, we revisit bi-linear operations, which
involve multiplicative interactions between hidden units and input embeddings.
We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that they constitute a natural
inductive bias for representing the evolution of hidden states in state
tracking tasks. These are the simplest type of task that require hidden units
to actively contribute to the behavior of the network. We also show that
bi-linear state updates form a natural hierarchy corresponding to state
tracking tasks of increasing complexity, with popular linear recurrent networks
such as Mamba residing at the lowest-complexity center of that hierarchy.

Motivation: HRL中低层策略的变化导致高层策略难以生成有效子目标，需解决子目标分布的复杂性和不确定性。

Result: 在连续控制基准测试中，样本效率和性能优于现有HRL方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合扩散模型和GP，有效解决了HRL中子目标生成和不确定性问题，提升了整体性能。

Abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) learns to make decisions on
multiple levels of temporal abstraction. A key challenge in HRL is that the
low-level policy changes over time, making it difficult for the high-level
policy to generate effective subgoals. To address this issue, the high-level
policy must capture a complex subgoal distribution while also accounting for
uncertainty in its estimates. We propose an approach that trains a conditional
diffusion model regularized by a Gaussian Process (GP) prior to generate a
complex variety of subgoals while leveraging principled GP uncertainty
quantification. Building on this framework, we develop a strategy that selects
subgoals from both the diffusion policy and GP's predictive mean. Our approach
outperforms prior HRL methods in both sample efficiency and performance on
challenging continuous control benchmarks.

Result: 实验表明，LLM能准确复述转换过程，但在生成正确对偶问题时表现不稳定，即使是简单实例。

Abstract: Consider the following task taught in introductory optimization courses which
addresses challenges articulated by the community at the intersection of
(generative) AI and OR: generate the dual of a linear program. LLMs, being
trained at web-scale, have the conversion process and many instances of Primal
to Dual Conversion (P2DC) at their disposal. Students may thus reasonably
expect that LLMs would perform well on the P2DC task. To assess this
expectation, this paper introduces DualSchool, a comprehensive framework for
generating and verifying P2DC instances. The verification procedure of
DualSchool uses the Canonical Graph Edit Distance, going well beyond existing
evaluation methods for optimization models, which exhibit many false positives
and negatives when applied to P2DC. Experiments performed by DualSchool reveal
interesting findings. Although LLMs can recite the conversion procedure
accurately, state-of-the-art open LLMs fail to consistently produce correct
duals. This finding holds even for the smallest two-variable instances and for
derivative tasks, such as correctness, verification, and error classification.
The paper also discusses the implications for educators, students, and the
development of large reasoning systems.

Conclusion: 通过关联记忆视角，为扩散模型的记忆-泛化现象提供了新见解，并验证了虚假状态的存在。

Abstract: Hopfield networks are associative memory (AM) systems, designed for storing
and retrieving patterns as local minima of an energy landscape. In the
classical Hopfield model, an interesting phenomenon occurs when the amount of
training data reaches its critical memory load $- spurious\,\,states$, or
unintended stable points, emerge at the end of the retrieval dynamics, leading
to incorrect recall. In this work, we examine diffusion models, commonly used
in generative modeling, from the perspective of AMs. The training phase of
diffusion model is conceptualized as memory encoding (training data is stored
in the memory). The generation phase is viewed as an attempt of memory
retrieval. In the small data regime the diffusion model exhibits a strong
memorization phase, where the network creates distinct basins of attraction
around each sample in the training set, akin to the Hopfield model below the
critical memory load. In the large data regime, a different phase appears where
an increase in the size of the training set fosters the creation of new
attractor states that correspond to manifolds of the generated samples.
Spurious states appear at the boundary of this transition and correspond to
emergent attractor states, which are absent in the training set, but, at the
same time, have distinct basins of attraction around them. Our findings
provide: a novel perspective on the memorization-generalization phenomenon in
diffusion models via the lens of AMs, theoretical prediction of existence of
spurious states, empirical validation of this prediction in commonly-used
diffusion models.

Result: 在标准数据集上表现优于传统Dropout、DropEdge和DropNode方法，后期训练效果更佳。

Conclusion: 泊松策略有效缓解过平滑，提升GNN性能。

Abstract: Over-smoothing remains a major challenge in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs),
where repeated message passing causes node representations to converge and lose
discriminative power. To address this, we propose a novel node selection
strategy based on Poisson processes, introducing stochastic but structure-aware
updates. Specifically, we equip each node with an independent Poisson clock,
enabling asynchronous and localized updates that preserve structural diversity.
We explore two applications of this strategy: as a replacement for
dropout-based regularization and as a dynamic subgraph training scheme.
Experimental results on standard benchmarks (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed)
demonstrate that our Poisson-based method yields competitive or improved
accuracy compared to traditional Dropout, DropEdge, and DropNode approaches,
particularly in later training stages.

Result: 预训练模型在右向检索上表现更好，不对称性可通过微调消除；预训练未克服长度泛化的根本限制。

Conclusion: 预训练选择性增强Transformer某些能力，但未突破其理论限制。

Abstract: Transformers have theoretical limitations in modeling certain
sequence-to-sequence tasks, yet it remains largely unclear if these limitations
play a role in large-scale pretrained LLMs, or whether LLMs might effectively
overcome these constraints in practice due to the scale of both the models
themselves and their pretraining data. We explore how these architectural
constraints manifest after pretraining, by studying a family of
$\textit{retrieval}$ and $\textit{copying}$ tasks inspired by Liu et al.
[2024]. We use the recently proposed C-RASP framework for studying length
generalization [Huang et al., 2025b] to provide guarantees for each of our
settings. Empirically, we observe an $\textit{induction-versus-anti-induction}$
asymmetry, where pretrained models are better at retrieving tokens to the right
(induction) rather than the left (anti-induction) of a query token. This
asymmetry disappears upon targeted fine-tuning if length-generalization is
guaranteed by theory. Mechanistic analysis reveals that this asymmetry is
connected to the differences in the strength of induction versus anti-induction
circuits within pretrained Transformers. We validate our findings through
practical experiments on real-world tasks demonstrating reliability risks. Our
results highlight that pretraining selectively enhances certain Transformer
capabilities, but does not overcome fundamental length-generalization limits.

Abstract: We design new differentially private algorithms for the problems of
adversarial bandits and bandits with expert advice. For adversarial bandits, we
give a simple and efficient conversion of any non-private bandit algorithm to a
private bandit algorithm. Instantiating our conversion with existing
non-private bandit algorithms gives a regret upper bound of
$O\left(\frac{\sqrt{KT}}{\sqrt{\epsilon}}\right)$, improving upon the existing
upper bound $O\left(\frac{\sqrt{KT \log(KT)}}{\epsilon}\right)$ for all
$\epsilon \leq 1$. In particular, our algorithms allow for sublinear expected
regret even when $\epsilon \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{T}}$, establishing the first
known separation between central and local differential privacy for this
problem. For bandits with expert advice, we give the first differentially
private algorithms, with expected regret
$O\left(\frac{\sqrt{NT}}{\sqrt{\epsilon}}\right),
O\left(\frac{\sqrt{KT\log(N)}\log(KT)}{\epsilon}\right)$, and
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{N^{1/6}K^{1/2}T^{2/3}\log(NT)}{\epsilon ^{1/3}} +
\frac{N^{1/2}\log(NT)}{\epsilon}\right)$, where $K$ and $N$ are the number of
actions and experts respectively. These rates allow us to get sublinear regret
for different combinations of small and large $K, N$ and $\epsilon.$

Abstract: Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) lies at the intersection of two pivotal
research areas: leveraging complementary information from multiple modalities
to improve downstream inference performance and enabling distributed training
to enhance efficiency and preserve privacy. Despite the growing interest in
MFL, there is currently no comprehensive taxonomy that organizes MFL through
the lens of different Federated Learning (FL) paradigms. This perspective is
important because multimodal data introduces distinct challenges across various
FL settings. These challenges, including modality heterogeneity, privacy
heterogeneity, and communication inefficiency, are fundamentally different from
those encountered in traditional unimodal or non-FL scenarios. In this paper,
we systematically examine MFL within the context of three major FL paradigms:
horizontal FL (HFL), vertical FL (VFL), and hybrid FL. For each paradigm, we
present the problem formulation, review representative training algorithms, and
highlight the most prominent challenge introduced by multimodal data in
distributed settings. We also discuss open challenges and provide insights for
future research. By establishing this taxonomy, we aim to uncover the novel
challenges posed by multimodal data from the perspective of different FL
paradigms and to offer a new lens through which to understand and advance the
development of MFL.

Conclusion: 多维锥体揭示了LLMs中真假命题的复杂结构，概念锥是研究抽象行为的有力工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong conversational abilities but
often generate falsehoods. Prior work suggests that the truthfulness of simple
propositions can be represented as a single linear direction in a model's
internal activations, but this may not fully capture its underlying geometry.
In this work, we extend the concept cone framework, recently introduced for
modeling refusal, to the domain of truth. We identify multi-dimensional cones
that causally mediate truth-related behavior across multiple LLM families. Our
results are supported by three lines of evidence: (i) causal interventions
reliably flip model responses to factual statements, (ii) learned cones
generalize across model architectures, and (iii) cone-based interventions
preserve unrelated model behavior. These findings reveal the richer,
multidirectional structure governing simple true/false propositions in LLMs and
highlight concept cones as a promising tool for probing abstract behaviors.

Abstract: Operational deployment of a fully automated greenhouse gas (GHG) plume
detection system remains an elusive goal for imaging spectroscopy missions,
despite recent advances in deep learning approaches. With the dramatic increase
in data availability, however, automation continues to increase in importance
for natural and anthropogenic emissions monitoring. This work reviews and
addresses several key obstacles in the field: data and label quality control,
prevention of spatiotemporal biases, and correctly aligned modeling objectives.
We demonstrate through rigorous experiments using multicampaign data from
airborne and spaceborne instruments that convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
are able to achieve operational detection performance when these obstacles are
alleviated. We demonstrate that a multitask model that learns both instance
detection and pixelwise segmentation simultaneously can successfully lead
towards an operational pathway. We evaluate the model's plume detectability
across emission source types and regions, identifying thresholds for
operational deployment. Finally, we provide analysis-ready data, models, and
source code for reproducibility, and work to define a set of best practices and
validation standards to facilitate future contributions to the field.

Abstract: Predictive modeling on tabular data is the cornerstone of many real-world
applications. Although gradient boosting machines and some recent deep models
achieve strong performance on tabular data, they often lack interpretability.
On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful
capabilities to generate human-like reasoning and explanations, but remain
under-performed for tabular data prediction. In this paper, we propose a new
approach that leverages reasoning-based LLMs, trained using reinforcement
learning, to perform more accurate and explainable predictions on tabular data.
Our method introduces custom reward functions that guide the model not only
toward high prediction accuracy but also toward human-understandable reasons
for its predictions. Experimental results show that our model achieves
promising performance on financial benchmark datasets, outperforming most
existing LLMs.

Abstract: Data Augmentation (DA) has become an essential tool to improve robustness and
generalization of modern machine learning. However, when deciding on DA
strategies it is critical to choose parameters carefully, and this can be a
daunting task which is traditionally left to trial-and-error or expensive
optimization based on validation performance. In this paper, we counter these
limitations by proposing a novel framework for optimizing DA. In particular, we
take a probabilistic view of DA, which leads to the interpretation of
augmentation parameters as model (hyper)-parameters, and the optimization of
the marginal likelihood with respect to these parameters as a Bayesian model
selection problem. Due to its intractability, we derive a tractable Evidence
Lower BOund (ELBO), which allows us to optimize augmentation parameters jointly
with model parameters. We provide extensive theoretical results on variational
approximation quality, generalization guarantees, invariance properties, and
connections to empirical Bayes. Through experiments on computer vision tasks,
we show that our approach improves calibration and yields robust performance
over fixed or no augmentation. Our work provides a rigorous foundation for
optimizing DA through Bayesian principles with significant potential for robust
machine learning.

Motivation: 全球T2DM患病率快速上升，带来巨大的健康和经济负担。早期检测高风险人群至关重要，但现有机器学习方法多依赖监督学习，缺乏阴性病例数据。

Method: 结合NMF与统计技术，从已诊断T2DM患者的多病共存和多重用药数据中提取潜在模式，并应用于未诊断个体的风险评估。

Result: 该方法提供了可解释且可扩展的解决方案，帮助医疗提供者及时干预，改善患者预后。

Conclusion: 提出的无监督框架有望降低T2DM未来的健康和经济负担。

Abstract: The global prevalence of diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM), is rapidly increasing, posing significant health and economic
challenges. T2DM not only disrupts blood glucose regulation but also damages
vital organs such as the heart, kidneys, eyes, nerves, and blood vessels,
leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. In the US alone, the economic
burden of diagnosed diabetes exceeded \$400 billion in 2022. Early detection of
individuals at risk is critical to mitigating these impacts. While machine
learning approaches for T2DM prediction are increasingly adopted, many rely on
supervised learning, which is often limited by the lack of confirmed negative
cases. To address this limitation, we propose a novel unsupervised framework
that integrates Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with statistical
techniques to identify individuals at risk of developing T2DM. Our method
identifies latent patterns of multimorbidity and polypharmacy among diagnosed
T2DM patients and applies these patterns to estimate the T2DM risk in
undiagnosed individuals. By leveraging data-driven insights from comorbidity
and medication usage, our approach provides an interpretable and scalable
solution that can assist healthcare providers in implementing timely
interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes and potentially reducing
the future health and economic burden of T2DM.

Abstract: Inference-time computation has emerged as a promising scaling axis for
improving large language model reasoning. However, despite yielding impressive
performance, the optimal allocation of inference-time computation remains
poorly understood. A central question is whether to prioritize sequential
scaling (e.g., longer chains of thought) or parallel scaling (e.g., majority
voting across multiple short chains of thought). In this work, we seek to
illuminate the landscape of test-time scaling by demonstrating the existence of
reasoning settings where sequential scaling offers an exponential advantage
over parallel scaling. These settings are based on graph connectivity problems
in challenging distributions of graphs. We validate our theoretical findings
with comprehensive experiments across a range of language models, including
models trained from scratch for graph connectivity with different chain of
thought strategies as well as large reasoning models.

Method: 通过训练1,300多个语言模型，比较Adam及其简化变体（如符号梯度和符号动量方法），并分析约束Adam动量参数相等的效果。

Result: 符号动量方法速度快于SGD，但性能不及Adam；约束动量参数相等的方法在保持性能的同时提供了新的理论解释。

Conclusion: 约束Adam动量参数相等是一种接近最优性能的选择，同时为Adam的工作原理提供了新的统计解释。

Abstract: Understanding the remarkable efficacy of Adam when training transformer-based
language models has become a central research topic within the optimization
community. To gain deeper insights, several simplifications of Adam have been
proposed, such as the signed gradient and signed momentum methods. In this
work, we conduct an extensive empirical study - training over 1,300 language
models across different data configurations and scales - comparing Adam to
several known simplified variants. We find that signed momentum methods are
faster than SGD, but consistently underperform relative to Adam, even after
careful tuning of momentum, clipping setting and learning rates. However, our
analysis reveals a compelling option that preserves near-optimal performance
while allowing for new insightful reformulations: constraining the Adam
momentum parameters to be equal. Beyond robust performance, this choice affords
new theoretical insights, highlights the "secret sauce" on top of signed
momentum, and grants a precise statistical interpretation: we show that Adam in
this setting implements a natural online algorithm for estimating the mean and
variance of gradients-one that arises from a mean-field Gaussian variational
inference perspective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统顺序的微调和压缩方法会导致性能损失，并产生不必要的中间模型。本文旨在通过联合优化减少这一差距。

Result: 实验表明，联合方法显著优于其他顺序压缩方法。

Conclusion: 联合微调和压缩是一种更高效的方法，能够直接构建更小的模型并保持性能。

Abstract: To reduce model size during post-training, compression methods, including
knowledge distillation, low-rank approximation, and pruning, are often applied
after fine-tuning the model. However, sequential fine-tuning and compression
sacrifices performance, while creating a larger than necessary model as an
intermediate step. In this work, we aim to reduce this gap, by directly
constructing a smaller model while guided by the downstream task. We propose to
jointly fine-tune and compress the model by gradually distilling it to a pruned
low-rank structure. Experiments demonstrate that joint fine-tuning and
compression significantly outperforms other sequential compression methods.

Result: OMDPD实现最优遗憾O(sqrt(K))和强约束违反O(sqrt(K))。

Conclusion: OMDPD为对抗性环境中的安全决策提供实用保证。

Abstract: Online safe reinforcement learning (RL) plays a key role in dynamic
environments, with applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and
cybersecurity. The objective is to learn optimal policies that maximize rewards
while satisfying safety constraints modeled by constrained Markov decision
processes (CMDPs). Existing methods achieve sublinear regret under stochastic
constraints but often fail in adversarial settings, where constraints are
unknown, time-varying, and potentially adversarially designed. In this paper,
we propose the Optimistic Mirror Descent Primal-Dual (OMDPD) algorithm, the
first to address online CMDPs with anytime adversarial constraints. OMDPD
achieves optimal regret O(sqrt(K)) and strong constraint violation O(sqrt(K))
without relying on Slater's condition or the existence of a strictly known safe
policy. We further show that access to accurate estimates of rewards and
transitions can further improve these bounds. Our results offer practical
guarantees for safe decision-making in adversarial environments.

Result: 理论证明PLS能高效优化目标回报并高概率保证安全；实验显示其安全性和奖励性能优于基线方法。

Conclusion: PLS实现了从学习到操作全过程的策略安全与高效奖励获取。

Abstract: A longstanding goal in safe reinforcement learning (RL) is a method to ensure
the safety of a policy throughout the entire process, from learning to
operation. However, existing safe RL paradigms inherently struggle to achieve
this objective. We propose a method, called Provably Lifetime Safe RL (PLS),
that integrates offline safe RL with safe policy deployment to address this
challenge. Our proposed method learns a policy offline using return-conditioned
supervised learning and then deploys the resulting policy while cautiously
optimizing a limited set of parameters, known as target returns, using Gaussian
processes (GPs). Theoretically, we justify the use of GPs by analyzing the
mathematical relationship between target and actual returns. We then prove that
PLS finds near-optimal target returns while guaranteeing safety with high
probability. Empirically, we demonstrate that PLS outperforms baselines both in
safety and reward performance, thereby achieving the longstanding goal to
obtain high rewards while ensuring the safety of a policy throughout the
lifetime from learning to operation.

Abstract: We revisit the classical, full-fledged Bayesian model averaging (BMA)
paradigm to ensemble pre-trained and/or lightly-finetuned foundation models to
enhance the classification performance on image and text data. To make BMA
tractable under foundation models, we introduce trainable linear classifiers
that take frozen features from the pre-trained foundation models as inputs. The
model posteriors over the linear classifiers tell us which linear heads and
frozen features are better suited for a given dataset, resulting in a
principled model ensembling method. Furthermore, we propose a computationally
cheaper, optimizable model averaging scheme (OMA). In OMA, we directly optimize
the model ensemble weights, just like those weights based on model posterior
distributions in BMA, by reducing the amount of surprise (expected entropy of
the predictions) we get from predictions of ensembled models. With the rapid
development of foundation models, these approaches will enable the
incorporation of future, possibly significantly better foundation models to
enhance the performance of challenging classification tasks.

Result: HBN在多种联邦学习场景中表现优异，尤其适用于小批次和异构数据。

Conclusion: HBN作为插件显著提升联邦学习性能，解决了BN在分布式环境中的局限性。

Abstract: Batch Normalisation (BN) is widely used in conventional deep neural network
training to harmonise the input-output distributions for each batch of data.
However, federated learning, a distributed learning paradigm, faces the
challenge of dealing with non-independent and identically distributed data
among the client nodes. Due to the lack of a coherent methodology for updating
BN statistical parameters, standard BN degrades the federated learning
performance. To this end, it is urgent to explore an alternative normalisation
solution for federated learning. In this work, we resolve the dilemma of the BN
layer in federated learning by developing a customised normalisation approach,
Hybrid Batch Normalisation (HBN). HBN separates the update of statistical
parameters (i.e. , means and variances used for evaluation) from that of
learnable parameters (i.e. , parameters that require gradient updates),
obtaining unbiased estimates of global statistical parameters in distributed
scenarios. In contrast with the existing solutions, we emphasise the supportive
power of global statistics for federated learning. The HBN layer introduces a
learnable hybrid distribution factor, allowing each computing node to
adaptively mix the statistical parameters of the current batch with the global
statistics. Our HBN can serve as a powerful plugin to advance federated
learning performance. It reflects promising merits across a wide range of
federated learning settings, especially for small batch sizes and heterogeneous
data.

Abstract: In tennis tournaments, momentum, a critical yet elusive phenomenon, reflects
the dynamic shifts in performance of athletes that can decisively influence
match outcomes. Despite its significance, momentum in terms of effective
modeling and multi-granularity analysis across points, games, sets, and matches
in tennis tournaments remains underexplored. In this study, we define a novel
Momentum Score (MS) metric to quantify a player's momentum level in
multi-granularity tennis tournaments, and design HydraNet, a momentum-driven
state-space duality-based framework, to model MS by integrating thirty-two
heterogeneous dimensions of athletes performance in serve, return, psychology
and fatigue. HydraNet integrates a Hydra module, which builds upon a
state-space duality (SSD) framework, capturing explicit momentum with a
sliding-window mechanism and implicit momentum through cross-game state
propagation. It also introduces a novel Versus Learning method to better
enhance the adversarial nature of momentum between the two athletes at a macro
level, along with a Collaborative-Adversarial Attention Mechanism (CAAM) for
capturing and integrating intra-player and inter-player dynamic momentum at a
micro level. Additionally, we construct a million-level tennis cross-tournament
dataset spanning from 2012-2023 Wimbledon and 2013-2023 US Open, and validate
the multi-granularity modeling capability of HydraNet for the MS metric on this
dataset. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the MS metric
constructed by the HydraNet framework provides actionable insights into how
momentum impacts outcomes at different granularities, establishing a new
foundation for momentum modeling and sports analysis. To the best of our
knowledge. The source code and datasets are available at

Conclusion: 时间步感知和分布校正优化对扩散模型偏好学习至关重要。

Abstract: Preference learning has become a central technique for aligning generative
models with human expectations. Recently, it has been extended to diffusion
models through methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However,
existing approaches such as Diffusion-DPO suffer from two key challenges:
timestep-dependent instability, caused by a mismatch between the reverse and
forward diffusion processes and by high gradient variance in early noisy
timesteps, and off-policy bias arising from the mismatch between optimization
and data collection policies. We begin by analyzing the reverse diffusion
trajectory and observe that instability primarily occurs at early timesteps
with low importance weights. To address these issues, we first propose
DPO-C\&M, a practical strategy that improves stability by clipping and masking
uninformative timesteps while partially mitigating off-policy bias. Building on
this, we introduce SDPO (Importance-Sampled Direct Preference Optimization), a
principled framework that incorporates importance sampling into the objective
to fully correct for off-policy bias and emphasize informative updates during
the diffusion process. Experiments on CogVideoX-2B, CogVideoX-5B, and
Wan2.1-1.3B demonstrate that both methods outperform standard Diffusion-DPO,
with SDPO achieving superior VBench scores, human preference alignment, and
training robustness. These results highlight the importance of timestep-aware,
distribution-corrected optimization in diffusion-based preference learning.

Result: 量化后的正弦非线性仍能保持表达能力，显著节省内存且性能损失可忽略。

Conclusion: 正弦变换在量化LoRA中有效，为高效参数微调提供了新方向。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a standard approach for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning, offering substantial reductions in trainable
parameters by modeling updates as the product of two low-rank matrices. While
effective, the low-rank constraint inherently limits representational capacity,
often resulting in reduced performance compared to full-rank fine-tuning.
Recent work by Ji et al. (2025) has addressed this limitation by applying a
fixed-frequency sinusoidal transformation to low-rank adapters, increasing
their stable rank without introducing additional parameters. This raises a
crucial question: can the same sine-activated technique be successfully applied
within the context of Post-Training Quantization to retain benefits even after
model compression? In this paper, we investigate this question by extending the
sinusoidal transformation framework to quantized LoRA adapters. We develop a
theoretical analysis showing that the stable rank of a quantized adapter is
tightly linked to that of its full-precision counterpart, motivating the use of
such rank-enhancing functions even under quantization. Our results demonstrate
that the expressivity gains from a sinusoidal non-linearity persist after
quantization, yielding highly compressed adapters with negligible loss in
performance. We validate our approach across a range of fine-tuning tasks for
language, vision and text-to-image generation achieving significant memory
savings while maintaining competitive accuracy.

TL;DR: DRG-Sapphire利用强化学习自动生成DRG编码，解决了LLMs在临床数据上的分布外问题，并在MIMIC-IV上达到最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRG编码需要大量人工且LLMs因数据分布外问题难以处理，因此开发自动化工具。

Method: 基于Qwen2.5-7B，采用GRPO强化学习，结合规则奖励解决领域挑战。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV上达到最优准确率，并生成可解释的DRG分配理由。

Conclusion: 强化学习性能受基础模型知识限制，对分布外任务，扩展监督微调比单独强化学习更有效。

Abstract: Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) codes are essential for hospital reimbursement
and operations but require labor-intensive assignment. Large Language Models
(LLMs) struggle with DRG coding due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) nature of
the task: pretraining corpora rarely contain private clinical or billing data.
We introduce DRG-Sapphire, which uses large-scale reinforcement learning (RL)
for automated DRG coding from clinical notes. Built on Qwen2.5-7B and trained
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using rule-based rewards,
DRG-Sapphire introduces a series of RL enhancements to address domain-specific
challenges not seen in previous mathematical tasks. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on the MIMIC-IV benchmark and generates
physician-validated reasoning for DRG assignments, significantly enhancing
explainability. Our study further sheds light on broader challenges of applying
RL to knowledge-intensive, OOD tasks. We observe that RL performance scales
approximately linearly with the logarithm of the number of supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) examples, suggesting that RL effectiveness is fundamentally
constrained by the domain knowledge encoded in the base model. For OOD tasks
like DRG coding, strong RL performance requires sufficient knowledge infusion
prior to RL. Consequently, scaling SFT may be more effective and
computationally efficient than scaling RL alone for such tasks.

Conclusion: 新策略有效解决了Transformer训练中的谱能量集中问题，提升了训练稳定性。

Abstract: Scaling Transformer to a large scale without using some technical tricks such
as learning rate warump and using an obviously lower learning rate is an
extremely challenging task, and is increasingly gaining more attention. In this
paper, we provide a theoretical analysis for the process of training
Transformer and reveal the rationale behind the model crash phenomenon in the
training process, termed \textit{spectral energy concentration} of
${\bW_q}^{\top} \bW_k$, which is the reason for a malignant entropy collapse,
where ${\bW_q}$ and $\bW_k$ are the projection matrices for the query and the
key in Transformer, respectively. To remedy this problem, motivated by
\textit{Weyl's Inequality}, we present a novel optimization strategy, \ie,
making the weight updating in successive steps smooth -- if the ratio
$\frac{\sigma_{1}(\nabla \bW_t)}{\sigma_{1}(\bW_{t-1})}$ is larger than a
threshold, we will automatically bound the learning rate to a weighted multiple
of $\frac{\sigma_{1}(\bW_{t-1})}{\sigma_{1}(\nabla \bW_t)}$, where $\nabla
\bW_t$ is the updating quantity in step $t$. Such an optimization strategy can
prevent spectral energy concentration to only a few directions, and thus can
avoid malignant entropy collapse which will trigger the model crash. We conduct
extensive experiments using ViT, Swin-Transformer and GPT, showing that our
optimization strategy can effectively and stably train these Transformers
without using learning rate warmup.

Abstract: We developed a deep learning algorithm for human activity recognition using

based on the Transformer architecture, which is widely used in natural language
processing. By leveraging this pretrained model, we aimed to improve
performance on the downstream task of human activity recognition. While this
task can be addressed using a vanilla Transformer, we propose an enhanced
n-dimensional numerical processing Transformer that incorporates three key
features: embedding n-dimensional numerical data through a linear layer,
binning-based pre-processing, and a linear transformation in the output layer.
We evaluated the effectiveness of our proposed model across five different
datasets. Compared to the vanilla Transformer, our model demonstrated 10%-15%
improvements in accuracy.

Motivation: 模拟电路设计复杂且多阶段，需要自动化工具提高效率和准确性。

Result: 在1M电路数据集上，FALCON拓扑推断准确率>99%，性能预测误差<10%，设计速度<1秒/实例。

Conclusion: FALCON是实用且可扩展的端到端模拟电路设计自动化基础模型。

Abstract: Designing analog circuits from performance specifications is a complex,
multi-stage process encompassing topology selection, parameter inference, and
layout feasibility. We introduce FALCON, a unified machine learning framework
that enables fully automated, specification-driven analog circuit synthesis
through topology selection and layout-constrained optimization. Given a target
performance, FALCON first selects an appropriate circuit topology using a
performance-driven classifier guided by human design heuristics. Next, it
employs a custom, edge-centric graph neural network trained to map circuit
topology and parameters to performance, enabling gradient-based parameter
inference through the learned forward model. This inference is guided by a
differentiable layout cost, derived from analytical equations capturing
parasitic and frequency-dependent effects, and constrained by design rules. We
train and evaluate FALCON on a large-scale custom dataset of 1M analog mm-wave
circuits, generated and simulated using Cadence Spectre across 20
expert-designed topologies. Through this evaluation, FALCON demonstrates >99\%
accuracy in topology inference, <10\% relative error in performance prediction,
and efficient layout-aware design that completes in under 1 second per
instance. Together, these results position FALCON as a practical and extensible
foundation model for end-to-end analog circuit design automation.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于多数据集微调语言模型的集成方法，通过分组训练小适配器并加权组合，显著提升效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如QLoRA）在单数据集上高效，但在多任务数据集上缺乏高效微调方案。

Method: 将n个数据集分为m组（m<<n），每组训练一个适配器，通过加权组合形成集成，利用低秩适配的一阶近似快速估计性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在多任务微调中高效且性能优越，适用于大规模语言模型。

Abstract: This paper develops an ensemble method for fine-tuning a language model to
multiple datasets. Existing methods, such as quantized LoRA (QLoRA), are
efficient when adapting to a single dataset. When training on multiple datasets
of different tasks, a common setup in practice, it remains unclear how to
design an efficient adaptation for fine-tuning language models. We propose to
use an ensemble of multiple smaller adapters instead of a single adapter per
task. We design an efficient algorithm that partitions $n$ datasets into $m$
groups, where $m$ is typically much smaller than $n$ in practice, and train one
adapter for each group before taking a weighted combination to form the
ensemble. The algorithm leverages a first-order approximation property of
low-rank adaptation to quickly obtain the fine-tuning performances of dataset
combinations since methods like LoRA stay close to the base model. Hence, we
use the gradients of the base model to estimate its behavior during
fine-tuning. Empirically, this approximation holds with less than $1\%$ error
on models with up to $34$ billion parameters, leading to an estimation of true
fine-tuning performances under $5\%$ error while speeding up computation
compared to base fine-tuning by $105$ times. When applied to fine-tune Llama
and GPT models on ten text classification tasks, our approach provides up to
$10\%$ higher average test accuracy over QLoRA, with only $9\%$ more FLOPs. On
a Llama model with $34$ billion parameters, an ensemble of QLoRA increases test
accuracy by $3\%$ compared to QLoRA, with only $8\%$ more FLOPs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗攻击模型依赖不现实的假设（如每轮奖励操纵和无界扰动），限制了其在真实系统中的适用性。

Method: 设计了虚假数据注入攻击策略，明确考虑奖励幅度和时间约束，模拟合法交互。

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，攻击能以次线性成本误导算法选择目标臂，揭示广泛使用的算法在实际对抗场景中的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 虚假数据注入是一种更实际的威胁模型，能有效攻击随机多臂老虎机算法。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on stochastic bandits have traditionally relied on some
unrealistic assumptions, such as per-round reward manipulation and unbounded
perturbations, limiting their relevance to real-world systems. We propose a
more practical threat model, Fake Data Injection, which reflects realistic
adversarial constraints: the attacker can inject only a limited number of
bounded fake feedback samples into the learner's history, simulating legitimate
interactions. We design efficient attack strategies under this model,
explicitly addressing both magnitude constraints (on reward values) and
temporal constraints (on when and how often data can be injected). Our
theoretical analysis shows that these attacks can mislead both Upper Confidence
Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling algorithms into selecting a target arm in
nearly all rounds while incurring only sublinear attack cost. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our strategies,
revealing significant vulnerabilities in widely used stochastic bandit
algorithms under practical adversarial scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决持续学习中因学习新任务而遗忘旧知识的问题，同时避免现有方法的高内存和计算开销。

Method: 提出SPARC方法，结合任务特定工作记忆和任务无关语义记忆，实现跨任务知识整合，并通过权重重新归一化减少任务特定偏差。

Result: SPARC仅需6%的参数，性能优于Seq-TinyImageNet，并与基于经验复现的方法相当。

Conclusion: SPARC是一种高效、可扩展的持续学习解决方案，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) has remained a significant challenge for deep neural
networks as learning new tasks erases previously acquired knowledge, either
partially or completely. Existing solutions often rely on experience rehearsal
or full model surrogates to mitigate CF. While effective, these approaches
introduce substantial memory and computational overhead, limiting their
scalability and applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we
propose SPARC, a scalable CL approach that eliminates the need for experience
rehearsal and full-model surrogates. By effectively combining task-specific
working memories and task-agnostic semantic memory for cross-task knowledge
consolidation, SPARC results in a remarkable parameter efficiency, using only
6% of the parameters required by full-model surrogates. Despite its lightweight
design, SPARC achieves superior performance on Seq-TinyImageNet and matches
rehearsal-based methods on various CL benchmarks. Additionally, weight
re-normalization in the classification layer mitigates task-specific biases,
establishing SPARC as a practical and scalable solution for CL under stringent
efficiency constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TPAUC是处理不平衡数据二元分类的重要指标，但现有随机优化方法存在局限性，如近似损失函数或高复杂度。

Method: 提出两种随机原始-对偶双块坐标算法，支持凸和非凸场景，通过块坐标更新优化TPAUC。

Result: 理论分析和实验结果表明，新算法在收敛速度和泛化性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 本研究推进了TPAUC优化的前沿，并为实际机器学习应用提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Two-way partial AUC (TPAUC) is a critical performance metric for binary
classification with imbalanced data, as it focuses on specific ranges of the
true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR). However, stochastic
algorithms for TPAUC optimization remain under-explored, with existing methods
either limited to approximated TPAUC loss functions or burdened by sub-optimal
complexities. To overcome these limitations, we introduce two innovative
stochastic primal-dual double block-coordinate algorithms for TPAUC
maximization. These algorithms utilize stochastic block-coordinate updates for
both the primal and dual variables, catering to both convex and non-convex
settings. We provide theoretical convergence rate analyses, demonstrating
significant improvements over prior approaches. Our experimental results, based
on multiple benchmark datasets, validate the superior performance of our
algorithms, showcasing faster convergence and better generalization. This work
advances the state of the art in TPAUC optimization and offers practical tools
for real-world machine learning applications.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）接近或超越人类水平，如何利用仅接触人类数据的小模型有效监督和增强这些强大模型成为关键挑战。

Method: 采用基于token级的集成策略，迭代结合多个弱专家模型，逐步解决其局限性，提升其对强学生模型的监督能力。

Result: 在分布内（ID）和分布外（OOD）数据集上，弱专家和学生模型分别实现了4%、3.2%和6%、2.28%的性能提升。

Conclusion: EnsemW2S方法有效推动了弱到强泛化的研究，为监督强大模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: With Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly approaching and potentially
surpassing human-level performance, it has become imperative to develop
approaches capable of effectively supervising and enhancing these powerful
models using smaller, human-level models exposed to only human-level data. We
address this critical weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization challenge by
proposing a novel method aimed at improving weak experts, by training on the
same limited human-level data, enabling them to generalize to complex,
super-human-level tasks. Our approach, called \textbf{EnsemW2S}, employs a
token-level ensemble strategy that iteratively combines multiple weak experts,
systematically addressing the shortcomings identified in preceding iterations.
By continuously refining these weak models, we significantly enhance their
collective ability to supervise stronger student models. We extensively
evaluate the generalization performance of both the ensemble of weak experts
and the subsequent strong student model across in-distribution (ID) and
out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. For OOD, we specifically introduce question
difficulty as an additional dimension for defining distributional shifts. Our
empirical results demonstrate notable improvements, achieving 4\%, and 3.2\%
improvements on ID datasets and, upto 6\% and 2.28\% on OOD datasets for
experts and student models respectively, underscoring the effectiveness of our
proposed method in advancing W2S generalization.

Motivation: 研究动机在于理解LLM作为评估者的理论特性，尤其是在多评分级别下排名的不确定性来源。

Method: 采用几何框架表示评估者和候选者，通过理论分析和贝叶斯推断整合不确定性。

Result: 发现二元评分系统中排名可识别，而三元及以上不可识别；贝叶斯方法显著提高了排名准确性和覆盖率。

Conclusion: 结论强调了在LLM作为评估者时，需采用更全面的不确定性量化方法。

Abstract: Automated evaluation of free-form outputs from large language models (LLMs)
is challenging because many distinct answers can be equally valid. A common
practice is to use LLMs themselves as judges, but the theoretical properties of
this approach are not yet well understood. We show that a geometric framework
that represents both judges and candidates as points on a probability simplex
can provide helpful insight on what is or is not identifiable using LLM judges.
Our theoretical analysis uncovers a "phase transition" in ranking
identifiability: for binary scoring systems, true rankings are identifiable
even with weak judges under mild assumptions, while rankings become
non-identifiable for three or more scoring levels even with infinite data,
absent additional prior knowledge. This non-identifiability highlights how
uncertainty in rankings stems from not only aleatoric uncertainty (i.e.,
inherent stochasticity in the data) but also epistemic uncertainty regarding
which assumptions hold, an aspect that has received limited attention until
now. To integrate both types of uncertainty, we use Bayesian inference to
encode assumptions as priors and conduct sensitivity analysis of ranking
estimates and credible intervals. Empirical evaluations across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that Bayesian inference yields more accurate rankings
and substantially improves coverage rates. These results underscore the
importance of taking a more holistic approach to uncertainty quantification
when using LLMs as judges.

Result: BOFormer在合成MOBO和实际超参数优化问题中均优于基准算法。

Conclusion: BOFormer为MOBO提供了有效解决方案，代码已开源以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) offers an efficient pipeline for optimizing
black-box functions with the help of a Gaussian process prior and an
acquisition function (AF). Recently, in the context of single-objective BO,
learning-based AFs witnessed promising empirical results given its favorable
non-myopic nature. Despite this, the direct extension of these approaches to
multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) suffer from the
\textit{hypervolume identifiability issue}, which results from the
non-Markovian nature of MOBO problems. To tackle this, inspired by the
non-Markovian RL literature and the success of Transformers in language
modeling, we present a generalized deep Q-learning framework and propose
\textit{BOFormer}, which substantiates this framework for MOBO via sequence
modeling. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that BOFormer constantly
outperforms the benchmark rule-based and learning-based algorithms in various
synthetic MOBO and real-world multi-objective hyperparameter optimization
problems. We have made the source code publicly available to encourage further
research in this direction.

Result: 实验表明TSFG在特征质量和适应性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TSFG为高效、自适应的特征生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Feature generation is a critical step in machine learning, aiming to enhance
model performance by capturing complex relationships within the data and
generating meaningful new features. Traditional feature generation methods
heavily rely on domain expertise and manual intervention, making the process
labor-intensive and challenging to adapt to different scenarios. Although
automated feature generation techniques address these issues to some extent,
they often face challenges such as feature redundancy, inefficiency in feature
space exploration, and limited adaptability to diverse datasets and tasks. To
address these problems, we propose a Two-Stage Feature Generation (TSFG)
framework, which integrates a Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture
with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The encoder-decoder model in TSFG
leverages the Transformer's self-attention mechanism to efficiently represent
and transform features, capturing complex dependencies within the data. PPO
further enhances TSFG by dynamically adjusting the feature generation strategy
based on task-specific feedback, optimizing the process for improved
performance and adaptability. TSFG dynamically generates high-quality feature
sets, significantly improving the predictive performance of machine learning
models. Experimental results demonstrate that TSFG outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in terms of feature quality and adaptability.

Result: 在LLaMA等模型上，困惑度降低18%，剪枝时间减少63%。

Conclusion: 新方法在准确性和效率上均优于现有剪枝技术。

Abstract: With the rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs), the demand for
memory and computational resources has grown significantly. Recent advances in
LLM pruning aim to reduce the size and computational cost of these models.
However, existing methods often suffer from either suboptimal pruning
performance or low time efficiency during the pruning process. In this work, we
propose an efficient and effective pruning method that simultaneously achieves
high pruning performance and fast pruning speed with improved calibration
efficiency. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) An activation
cosine similarity loss-guided pruning metric, which considers the angular
deviation of the output activation between the dense and pruned models. (2) An
activation variance-guided pruning metric, which helps preserve semantic
distinctions in output activations after pruning, enabling effective pruning
with shorter input sequences. These two components can be readily combined to
enhance LLM pruning in both accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results show
that our method achieves up to an 18% reduction in perplexity and up to 63%
decrease in pruning time on prevalent LLMs such as LLaMA, LLaMA-2, and OPT.

Motivation: 解决深度学习中的过拟合、数值不稳定性和残差流方差增加等问题，同时避免传统正则化和归一化的额外成本。

Method: 提出anTransformer方法，通过约束参数范数并利用高维随机向量范数的紧致性，对所有表示进行标量乘法归一化。

Result: 在GPT训练中，收敛速度比QK归一化模型快40%，运行时开销增加不到3%，且支持更大批次和更少超参数训练。

Conclusion: anTransformer方法在保持经典GPT架构优点的同时，显著提升了训练效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: In deep learning, regularization and normalization are common solutions for
challenges such as overfitting, numerical instabilities, and the increasing
variance in the residual stream. An alternative approach is to force all
parameters and representations to lie on a hypersphere. This removes the need
for regularization and increases convergence speed, but comes with additional
costs. In this work, we propose a more holistic but approximate normalization
(anTransformer). Our approach constrains the norm of parameters and normalizes
all representations via scalar multiplications motivated by the tight
concentration of the norms of high-dimensional random vectors. When applied to
GPT training, we observe a 40% faster convergence compared to models with QK
normalization, with less than 3% additional runtime. Deriving scaling laws for
anGPT, we found our method enables training with larger batch sizes and fewer
hyperparameters, while matching the favorable scaling characteristics of
classic GPT architectures.

Result: 在噪声标签和部分标签学习中表现优异，理论证明在温和条件下可逼近监督对比学习效果。

Conclusion: 该框架具有高度通用性，能显著提升现有方法性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has achieved remarkable success in learning effective
representations, with supervised contrastive learning often outperforming
self-supervised approaches. However, in real-world scenarios, data annotations
are often ambiguous or inaccurate, meaning that class labels may not reliably
indicate whether two examples belong to the same class. This limitation
restricts the applicability of supervised contrastive learning. To address this
challenge, we introduce the concept of ``continuous semantic similarity'' to
define positive and negative pairs. Instead of directly relying on imprecise
class labels, we measure the semantic similarity between example pairs, which
quantifies how closely they belong to the same category by iteratively refining
weak supervisory signals. Based on this concept, we propose a graph-theoretic
framework for weakly-supervised contrastive learning, where semantic similarity
serves as the graph weights. Our framework is highly versatile and can be
applied to many weakly-supervised learning scenarios. We demonstrate its
effectiveness through experiments in two common settings, i.e., noisy label and
partial label learning, where existing methods can be easily integrated to
significantly improve performance. Theoretically, we establish an error bound
for our approach, showing that it can approximate supervised contrastive
learning under mild conditions. The implementation code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法依赖资源密集的微调且泛化能力差，需要一种更高效的方法来检测不良流程行为。

Method: 使用RAG技术，为LLM提供包含其他流程中不良行为的知识库，无需微调即可检测当前流程的不良行为。

Result: 评估表明，该方法在检测不良行为方面优于微调LLM，RAG是一种可行的替代方案。

Conclusion: RAG结合事件日志的上下文信息，是一种高效且无需微调的检测不良流程行为的解决方案。

Abstract: Conformance checking techniques detect undesired process behavior by
comparing process executions that are recorded in event logs to desired
behavior that is captured in a dedicated process model. If such models are not
available, conformance checking techniques are not applicable, but
organizations might still be interested in detecting undesired behavior in
their processes. To enable this, existing approaches use Large Language Models
(LLMs), assuming that they can learn to distinguish desired from undesired
behavior through fine-tuning. However, fine-tuning is highly resource-intensive
and the fine-tuned LLMs often do not generalize well. To address these
limitations, we propose an approach that requires neither a dedicated process
model nor resource-intensive fine-tuning to detect undesired process behavior.
Instead, we use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide an LLM with
direct access to a knowledge base that contains both desired and undesired
process behavior from other processes, assuming that the LLM can transfer this
knowledge to the process at hand. Our evaluation shows that our approach
outperforms fine-tuned LLMs in detecting undesired behavior, demonstrating that
RAG is a viable alternative to resource-intensive fine-tuning, particularly
when enriched with relevant context from the event log, such as frequent traces
and activities.

### [358] [Estimating the Effects of Sample Training Orders for Large Language Models without Retraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22042)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需重新训练的框架，通过近似Adam优化器更新和随机投影方法，高效估计任意训练样本顺序下的模型参数，并应用于课程设计和记忆/泛化分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要重新训练模型以研究样本顺序对LLMs的影响，计算成本高，因此设计了一种无需重新训练的高效框架。

Method: 使用一阶和二阶泰勒展开近似Adam优化器更新，结合随机投影方法存储中间检查点，高效估计模型参数。

Result: 框架能有效复现真实模型性能，并在课程设计和记忆/泛化分析中展示了潜力。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究样本顺序对LLMs的影响提供了高效工具，并具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: The order of training samples plays a crucial role in large language models
(LLMs), significantly impacting both their external performance and internal
learning dynamics. Traditional methods for investigating this effect generally
require retraining the model with various sample orders, which is
computationally infeasible for LLMs. In this work, we improve traditional
methods by designing a retraining-free framework. By approximating Adam
optimizer updates with first- and second-order Taylor expansions and utilizing
random projection methods to store intermediate checkpoints, our framework can
efficiently estimate model parameters for arbitrary training sample orders.
Next, we apply our framework to two downstream research problems: (1) Training
curriculum design for LLMs -- we base our retraining-free framework to propose
a novel curriculum learning strategy that augments curriculum proposals with
estimated model performances, enabling more informed sample scheduling. (2)
LLMs' memorization and generalization effect analysis -- we use our
retraining-free framework to estimate how the positions of training samples
influence LLMs' capacity for memorization and generalization. We conduct
extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our retraining-free
framework in reproducing the true model performances, and further demonstrate
its potential in optimizing LLM training curricula and analyzing the
memorization and generalization effects of LLMs.

Motivation: 解决传统切片方法在高维数据中计算复杂度高和线性投影限制的问题。

Method: 将min-SWGG重新表述为双层优化问题，并提出可微分近似方案，同时扩展到流形数据。

Result: 在多种应用中展示了方法的实用性，包括流形上的梯度流和高维空间中的图像生成。

Conclusion: 改进的min-SWGG方法在高维和流形数据中具有高效性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Optimal Transport (OT) has attracted significant interest in the machine
learning community, not only for its ability to define meaningful distances
between probability distributions -- such as the Wasserstein distance -- but
also for its formulation of OT plans. Its computational complexity remains a
bottleneck, though, and slicing techniques have been developed to scale OT to
large datasets. Recently, a novel slicing scheme, dubbed min-SWGG, lifts a
single one-dimensional plan back to the original multidimensional space,
finally selecting the slice that yields the lowest Wasserstein distance as an
approximation of the full OT plan. Despite its computational and theoretical
advantages, min-SWGG inherits typical limitations of slicing methods: (i) the
number of required slices grows exponentially with the data dimension, and (ii)
it is constrained to linear projections. Here, we reformulate min-SWGG as a
bilevel optimization problem and propose a differentiable approximation scheme
to efficiently identify the optimal slice, even in high-dimensional settings.
We furthermore define its generalized extension for accommodating to data
living on manifolds. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of our
approach in various applications, including gradient flows on manifolds and
high-dimensional spaces, as well as a novel sliced OT-based conditional flow
matching for image generation -- where fast computation of transport plans is
essential.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SUGAR的ReLU正则化方法，通过替换反向传播中的梯度，解决了ReLU的‘死亡’问题，并在多种网络架构中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ReLU因其简单性和稀疏性而受欢迎，但其‘死亡’问题限制了其有效性。论文旨在通过改进梯度处理来提升ReLU的性能。

Method: 提出SUGAR方法，保留ReLU的前向传播特性，但在反向传播中使用平滑的替代梯度以避免梯度消失。

Result: SUGAR在VGG-16、ResNet-18等架构中显著提升性能，甚至在现代架构中表现优于GELU。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过适当的梯度处理，传统ReLU仍能成为深度学习中的强大工具，挑战了先进激活函数必须性的观点。

Abstract: Modeling sophisticated activation functions within deep learning
architectures has evolved into a distinct research direction. Functions such as
GELU, SELU, and SiLU offer smooth gradients and improved convergence
properties, making them popular choices in state-of-the-art models. Despite
this trend, the classical ReLU remains appealing due to its simplicity,
inherent sparsity, and other advantageous topological characteristics. However,
ReLU units are prone to becoming irreversibly inactive - a phenomenon known as
the dying ReLU problem - which limits their overall effectiveness. In this
work, we introduce surrogate gradient learning for ReLU (SUGAR) as a novel,
plug-and-play regularizer for deep architectures. SUGAR preserves the standard
ReLU function during the forward pass but replaces its derivative in the
backward pass with a smooth surrogate that avoids zeroing out gradients. We
demonstrate that SUGAR, when paired with a well-chosen surrogate function,
substantially enhances generalization performance over convolutional network
architectures such as VGG-16 and ResNet-18, providing sparser activations while
effectively resurrecting dead ReLUs. Moreover, we show that even in modern
architectures like Conv2NeXt and Swin Transformer - which typically employ GELU
- substituting these with SUGAR yields competitive and even slightly superior
performance. These findings challenge the prevailing notion that advanced
activation functions are necessary for optimal performance. Instead, they
suggest that the conventional ReLU, particularly with appropriate gradient
handling, can serve as a strong, versatile revived classic across a broad range
of deep learning vision models.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了神经符号回归（NSR）中Transformer的记忆偏差问题，发现其难以生成训练数据中未出现的表达式，并提出测试时策略以减轻偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NSR方法在大规模合成数据集上预训练的Transformer在符号回归中表现不佳，尤其是在输入变量较多时，作者假设这是由于Transformer的记忆偏差。

Method: 通过合成数据集定量评估Transformer的记忆偏差，并进行理论分析，同时测试不同测试时策略的效果。

Result: 实验表明，测试时提供额外信息可显著减轻记忆偏差，但减少偏差不一定提升性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了NSR方法的局限性，为设计更鲁棒的符号回归方法提供了基础。

Abstract: Symbolic regression aims to discover mathematical equations that fit given
numerical data. It has been applied in various fields of scientific research,
such as producing human-readable expressions that explain physical phenomena.
Recently, Neural symbolic regression (NSR) methods that involve Transformers
pre-trained on large-scale synthetic datasets have gained attention. While
these methods offer advantages such as short inference time, they suffer from
low performance, particularly when the number of input variables is large. In
this study, we hypothesized that this limitation stems from the memorization
bias of Transformers in symbolic regression. We conducted a quantitative
evaluation of this bias in Transformers using a synthetic dataset and found
that Transformers rarely generate expressions not present in the training data.
Additional theoretical analysis reveals that this bias arises from the
Transformer's inability to construct expressions compositionally while
verifying their numerical validity. We finally examined if tailoring test-time
strategies can lead to reduced memorization bias and better performance. We
empirically demonstrate that providing additional information to the model at
test time can significantly mitigate memorization bias. On the other hand, we
also find that reducing memorization bias does not necessarily correlate with
improved performance. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of
the limitations of NSR approaches and offer a foundation for designing more
robust, generalizable symbolic regression methods. Code is available at

Result: 实验表明，与传统联邦学习相比，新框架在公共数据集上实现了高达15%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 该框架平衡了隐私、合规性和性能，为全球医疗中的临床工作流提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising approach for training clinical AI
models without centralizing sensitive patient data. However, its real-world
adoption is hindered by challenges related to privacy, resource constraints,
and compliance. Existing Differential Privacy (DP) approaches often apply
uniform noise, which disproportionately degrades model performance, even among
well-compliant institutions. In this work, we propose a novel compliance-aware
FL framework that enhances DP by adaptively adjusting noise based on
quantifiable client compliance scores. Additionally, we introduce a compliance
scoring tool based on key healthcare and security standards to promote secure,
inclusive, and equitable participation across diverse clinical settings.
Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that integrating
under-resourced, less compliant clinics with highly regulated institutions
yields accuracy improvements of up to 15% over traditional FL. This work
advances FL by balancing privacy, compliance, and performance, making it a
viable solution for real-world clinical workflows in global healthcare.

Conclusion: GRALE为图表示学习提供了一种通用的预训练方法，适用于多种复杂任务。

Abstract: Although graph-based learning has attracted a lot of attention, graph
representation learning is still a challenging task whose resolution may impact
key application fields such as chemistry or biology. To this end, we introduce
GRALE, a novel graph autoencoder that encodes and decodes graphs of varying
sizes into a shared embedding space. GRALE is trained using an Optimal
Transport-inspired loss that compares the original and reconstructed graphs and
leverages a differentiable node matching module, which is trained jointly with
the encoder and decoder. The proposed attention-based architecture relies on
Evoformer, the core component of AlphaFold, which we extend to support both
graph encoding and decoding. We show, in numerical experiments on simulated and
molecular data, that GRALE enables a highly general form of pre-training,
applicable to a wide range of downstream tasks, from classification and
regression to more complex tasks such as graph interpolation, editing,
matching, and prediction.

Conclusion: BiMi Sheets为偏见缓解方法的标准化和比较提供了实用工具，有望促进其广泛应用。

Abstract: Over the past 15 years, hundreds of bias mitigation methods have been
proposed in the pursuit of fairness in machine learning (ML). However,
algorithmic biases are domain-, task-, and model-specific, leading to a
`portability trap': bias mitigation solutions in one context may not be
appropriate in another. Thus, a myriad of design choices have to be made when
creating a bias mitigation method, such as the formalization of fairness it
pursues, and where and how it intervenes in the ML pipeline. This creates
challenges in benchmarking and comparing the relative merits of different bias
mitigation methods, and limits their uptake by practitioners.
  We propose BiMi Sheets as a portable, uniform guide to document the design
choices of any bias mitigation method. This enables researchers and
practitioners to quickly learn its main characteristics and to compare with
their desiderata. Furthermore, the sheets' structure allow for the creation of
a structured database of bias mitigation methods. In order to foster the
sheets' adoption, we provide a platform for finding and creating BiMi Sheets at
bimisheet.com.

Conclusion: Oryx在复杂协调任务中表现出色，并展示了强大的泛化能力，为离线MARL提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: A key challenge in offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is
achieving effective many-agent multi-step coordination in complex environments.
In this work, we propose Oryx, a novel algorithm for offline cooperative MARL
to directly address this challenge. Oryx adapts the recently proposed
retention-based architecture Sable and combines it with a sequential form of
implicit constraint Q-learning (ICQ), to develop a novel offline
auto-regressive policy update scheme. This allows Oryx to solve complex
coordination challenges while maintaining temporal coherence over lengthy
trajectories. We evaluate Oryx across a diverse set of benchmarks from prior
works (SMAC, RWARE, and Multi-Agent MuJoCo) covering tasks of both discrete and
continuous control, varying in scale and difficulty. Oryx achieves
state-of-the-art performance on more than 80% of the 65 tested datasets,
outperforming prior offline MARL methods and demonstrating robust
generalisation across domains with many agents and long horizons. Finally, we
introduce new datasets to push the limits of many-agent coordination in offline
MARL, and demonstrate Oryx's superior ability to scale effectively in such
settings. We will make all of our datasets, experimental data, and code
available upon publication.

Conclusion: 联合节点嵌入空间的设计是图不确定性估计的关键，适用于同质性和异质性图。

Abstract: While uncertainty estimation for graphs recently gained traction, most
methods rely on homophily and deteriorate in heterophilic settings. We address
this by analyzing message passing neural networks from an information-theoretic
perspective and developing a suitable analog to data processing inequality to
quantify information throughout the model's layers. In contrast to non-graph
domains, information about the node-level prediction target can increase with
model depth if a node's features are semantically different from its neighbors.
Therefore, on heterophilic graphs, the latent embeddings of an MPNN each
provide different information about the data distribution - different from
homophilic settings. This reveals that considering all node representations
simultaneously is a key design principle for epistemic uncertainty estimation
on graphs beyond homophily. We empirically confirm this with a simple post-hoc
density estimator on the joint node embedding space that provides
state-of-the-art uncertainty on heterophilic graphs. At the same time, it
matches prior work on homophilic graphs without explicitly exploiting homophily
through post-processing.

Method: 通过框架分析梯度方差，提出一个与目标函数类的成对独立性和输入分布的碰撞熵相关的界限。

Conclusion: 论文的理论和实验分析为理解深度学习在特定任务中的局限性提供了新视角。

Abstract: In the past decade gradient-based deep learning has revolutionized several
applications. However, this rapid advancement has highlighted the need for a
deeper theoretical understanding of its limitations. Research has shown that,
in many practical learning tasks, the information contained in the gradient is
so minimal that gradient-based methods require an exceedingly large number of
iterations to achieve success. The informativeness of the gradient is typically
measured by its variance with respect to the random selection of a target
function from a hypothesis class.
  We use this framework and give a general bound on the variance in terms of a
parameter related to the pairwise independence of the target function class and
the collision entropy of the input distribution. Our bound scales as $
\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon+e^{-\frac{1}{2}\mathcal{E}_c}) $, where $
\tilde{\mathcal{O}} $ hides factors related to the regularity of the learning
model and the loss function, $ \varepsilon $ measures the pairwise independence
of the target function class and $\mathcal{E}_c$ is the collision entropy of
the input distribution.
  To demonstrate the practical utility of our bound, we apply it to the class
of Learning with Errors (LWE) mappings and high-frequency functions. In
addition to the theoretical analysis, we present experiments to understand
better the nature of recent deep learning-based attacks on LWE.

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful tool in
machine learning and computer vision to learn meaningful representations from
unlabeled data. Meanwhile, its empirical success has encouraged many
theoretical studies to reveal the learning mechanisms. However, in the existing
theoretical research, the role of data augmentation is still under-exploited,
especially the effects of specific augmentation types. To fill in the blank, we
for the first time propose an augmentation-aware error bound for
self-supervised contrastive learning, showing that the supervised risk is
bounded not only by the unsupervised risk, but also explicitly by a trade-off
induced by data augmentation. Then, under a novel semantic label assumption, we
discuss how certain augmentation methods affect the error bound. Lastly, we
conduct both pixel- and representation-level experiments to verify our proposed
theoretical results.

Conclusion: BNDL通过解耦学习和不确定性估计，显著提升了深度神经网络的实用性和可解释性。

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have demonstrated significant success due to
their powerful expressiveness, most models struggle to meet practical
requirements for uncertainty estimation. Concurrently, the entangled nature of
deep neural networks leads to a multifaceted problem, where various localized
explanation techniques reveal that multiple unrelated features influence the
decisions, thereby undermining interpretability. To address these challenges,
we develop a Bayesian Non-negative Decision Layer (BNDL), which reformulates
deep neural networks as a conditional Bayesian non-negative factor analysis. By
leveraging stochastic latent variables, the BNDL can model complex dependencies
and provide robust uncertainty estimation. Moreover, the sparsity and
non-negativity of the latent variables encourage the model to learn
disentangled representations and decision layers, thereby improving
interpretability. We also offer theoretical guarantees that BNDL can achieve
effective disentangled learning. In addition, we developed a corresponding
variational inference method utilizing a Weibull variational inference network
to approximate the posterior distribution of the latent variables. Our
experimental results demonstrate that with enhanced disentanglement
capabilities, BNDL not only improves the model's accuracy but also provides
reliable uncertainty estimation and improved interpretability.

Result: 规则验证器存在高假阴性率，模型验证器易受攻击导致假阳性。

Conclusion: 两种验证器各有风险，需开发更稳健的奖励系统。

Abstract: Trustworthy verifiers are essential for the success of reinforcement learning
with verifiable reward (RLVR), which is the core methodology behind various
large reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1. In complex domains like
mathematical reasoning, rule-based verifiers have been widely adopted in
previous works to train strong reasoning models. However, the reliability of
these verifiers and their impact on the RL training process remain poorly
understood. In this work, we take mathematical reasoning as a case study and
conduct a comprehensive analysis of various verifiers in both static evaluation
and RL training scenarios. First, we find that current open-source rule-based
verifiers often fail to recognize equivalent answers presented in different
formats across multiple commonly used mathematical datasets, resulting in
non-negligible false negative rates. This limitation adversely affects RL
training performance and becomes more pronounced as the policy model gets
stronger. Subsequently, we investigate model-based verifiers as a potential
solution to address these limitations. While the static evaluation shows that
model-based verifiers achieve significantly higher verification accuracy,
further analysis and RL training results imply that they are highly susceptible
to hacking, where they misclassify certain patterns in responses as correct
(i.e., false positives). This vulnerability is exploited during policy model
optimization, leading to artificially inflated rewards. Our findings underscore
the unique risks inherent to both rule-based and model-based verifiers, aiming
to offer valuable insights to develop more robust reward systems in
reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: LaMM为高效训练NNP模型提供了可行方案，解决了传统方法的计算瓶颈。

Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) are crucial for accelerating computational
materials science by surrogating density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
Improving their accuracy is possible through pre-training and fine-tuning,
where an NNP model is first pre-trained on a large-scale dataset and then
fine-tuned on a smaller target dataset. However, this approach is
computationally expensive, mainly due to the cost of DFT-based dataset labeling
and load imbalances during large-scale pre-training. To address this, we
propose LaMM, a semi-supervised pre-training method incorporating improved
denoising self-supervised learning and a load-balancing algorithm for efficient
multi-node training. We demonstrate that our approach effectively leverages a
large-scale dataset of $\sim$300 million semi-labeled samples to train a single
NNP model, resulting in improved fine-tuning performance in terms of both speed
and accuracy.

contextual features. This gives rise to predict-then-optimize problems, where a
machine learning model predicts problem parameters that are then used to make
decisions via optimization. A growing body of work on decision-focused learning
(DFL) addresses this setting by training models specifically to produce
predictions that maximize downstream decision quality, rather than accuracy.
While effective, DFL is computationally expensive, because it requires solving
the optimization problem with the predicted parameters at each loss evaluation.
In this work, we address this computational bottleneck for linear optimization
problems, a common class of problems in both DFL literature and real-world
applications. We propose a solver-free training method that exploits the
geometric structure of linear optimization to enable efficient training with
minimal degradation in solution quality. Our method is based on the insight
that a solution is optimal if and only if it achieves an objective value that
is at least as good as that of its adjacent vertices on the feasible polytope.
Building on this, our method compares the estimated quality of the ground-truth
optimal solution with that of its precomputed adjacent vertices, and uses this
as loss function. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces
computational cost while maintaining high decision quality.

Abstract: Non-conservative uncertainty bounds are key for both assessing an estimation
algorithm's accuracy and in view of downstream tasks, such as its deployment in
safety-critical contexts. In this paper, we derive a tight, non-asymptotic
uncertainty bound for kernel-based estimation, which can also handle correlated
noise sequences. Its computation relies on a mild norm-boundedness assumption
on the unknown function and the noise, returning the worst-case function
realization within the hypothesis class at an arbitrary query input location.
The value of this function is shown to be given in terms of the posterior mean
and covariance of a Gaussian process for an optimal choice of the measurement
noise covariance. By rigorously analyzing the proposed approach and comparing
it with other results in the literature, we show its effectiveness in returning
tight and easy-to-compute bounds for kernel-based estimates.

Abstract: Understanding the reasoning behind deep learning model predictions is crucial
in cheminformatics and drug discovery, where molecular design determines their
properties. However, current evaluation frameworks for Explainable AI (XAI) in
this domain often rely on artificial datasets or simplified tasks, employing
data-derived metrics that fail to capture the complexity of real-world
scenarios and lack a direct link to explanation faithfulness. To address this,
we introduce B-XAIC, a novel benchmark constructed from real-world molecular

Through a comprehensive evaluation using B-XAIC, we reveal limitations of
existing XAI methods for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in the molecular domain.
This benchmark provides a valuable resource for gaining deeper insights into
the faithfulness of XAI, facilitating the development of more reliable and

Abstract: Co-branding has become a vital strategy for businesses aiming to expand
market reach within recommendation systems. However, identifying effective
cross-industry partnerships remains challenging due to resource imbalances,
uncertain brand willingness, and ever-changing market conditions. In this
paper, we provide the first systematic study of this problem and propose a
unified online-offline framework to enable co-branding recommendations. Our
approach begins by constructing a bipartite graph linking ``initiating'' and
``target'' brands to quantify co-branding probabilities and assess market
benefits. During the online learning phase, we dynamically update the graph in
response to market feedback, while striking a balance between exploring new
collaborations for long-term gains and exploiting established partnerships for
immediate benefits. To address the high initial co-branding costs, our
framework mitigates redundant exploration, thereby enhancing short-term
performance while ensuring sustainable strategic growth. In the offline
optimization phase, our framework consolidates the interests of multiple
sub-brands under the same parent brand to maximize overall returns, avoid
excessive investment in single sub-brands, and reduce unnecessary costs
associated with over-prioritizing a single sub-brand. We present a theoretical
analysis of our approach, establishing a highly nontrivial sublinear regret
bound for online learning in the complex co-branding problem, and enhancing the
approximation guarantee for the NP-hard offline budget allocation optimization.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world co-branding datasets demonstrate
the practical effectiveness of our framework, with at least 12\% improvement.

Method: 提出KronSAE架构，利用Kronecker乘积分解；引入mAND激活函数。

Result: 显著减少内存和计算开销，提升解释性和性能。

Conclusion: KronSAE和mAND为大规模稀疏自编码器提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have demonstrated significant promise in
interpreting the hidden states of language models by decomposing them into
interpretable latent directions. However, training SAEs at scale remains
challenging, especially when large dictionary sizes are used. While decoders
can leverage sparse-aware kernels for efficiency, encoders still require
computationally intensive linear operations with large output dimensions. To
address this, we propose KronSAE, a novel architecture that factorizes the
latent representation via Kronecker product decomposition, drastically reducing
memory and computational overhead. Furthermore, we introduce mAND, a
differentiable activation function approximating the binary AND operation,
which improves interpretability and performance in our factorized framework.

Result: 策略外GRPO在奖励上表现优于或与策略内GRPO相当。

Conclusion: 策略外GRPO是一种有效的优化方法，值得进一步研究和应用。

Abstract: We revisit Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in both on-policy and
off-policy optimization regimes. Our motivation comes from recent work on
off-policy Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which improves training
stability, sampling efficiency, and memory usage. In addition, a recent
analysis of GRPO suggests that estimating the advantage function with
off-policy samples could be beneficial. Building on these observations, we
adapt GRPO to the off-policy setting. We show that both on-policy and
off-policy GRPO objectives yield an improvement in the reward. This result
motivates the use of clipped surrogate objectives in the off-policy version of
GRPO. We then compare the empirical performance of reinforcement learning with
verifiable rewards in post-training using both GRPO variants. Our results show
that off-policy GRPO either significantly outperforms or performs on par with
its on-policy counterpart.

Abstract: Novel techniques in evolutionary optimization, simulation and machine
learning allow for a broad analysis of domains like fluid dynamics, in which
computation is expensive and flow behavior is complex. Under the term of full
domain analysis we understand the ability to efficiently determine the full
space of solutions in a problem domain, and analyze the behavior of those
solutions in an accessible and interactive manner. The goal of full domain
analysis is to deepen our understanding of domains by generating many examples
of flow, their diversification, optimization and analysis. We define a formal
model for full domain analysis, its current state of the art, and requirements
of subcomponents. Finally, an example is given to show what we can learn by
using full domain analysis. Full domain analysis, rooted in optimization and
machine learning, can be a helpful tool in understanding complex systems in

Abstract: Cardiovascular signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG),
electrocardiography (ECG), and blood pressure (BP) are inherently correlated
and complementary, together reflecting the health of cardiovascular system.
However, their joint utilization in real-time monitoring is severely limited by
diverse acquisition challenges from noisy wearable recordings to burdened
invasive procedures. Here we propose UniCardio, a multi-modal diffusion
transformer that reconstructs low-quality signals and synthesizes unrecorded
signals in a unified generative framework. Its key innovations include a
specialized model architecture to manage the signal modalities involved in
generation tasks and a continual learning paradigm to incorporate varying
modality combinations. By exploiting the complementary nature of cardiovascular
signals, UniCardio clearly outperforms recent task-specific baselines in signal
denoising, imputation, and translation. The generated signals match the
performance of ground-truth signals in detecting abnormal health conditions and
estimating vital signs, even in unseen domains, while ensuring interpretability
for human experts. These advantages position UniCardio as a promising avenue
for advancing AI-assisted healthcare.

Conclusion: 研究为分离知识获取与推理提供了可能性，有望提升模型的鲁棒性和数据效率。

Abstract: Pretraining on large, semantically rich datasets is key for developing
language models. Surprisingly, recent studies have shown that even synthetic
data, generated procedurally through simple semantic-free algorithms, can yield
some of the same benefits as natural language pretraining. It is unclear what
specific capabilities such simple synthetic data instils in a model, where
these capabilities reside in the architecture, and how they manifest within its
weights. In this short paper, we identify several beneficial forms of
procedural data, together with specific algorithmic reasoning skills that
improve in small transformers. Our core finding is that different procedural
rules instil distinct but complementary inductive structures in the model. With
extensive ablations and partial-transfer experiments, we discover that these
structures reside in different parts of the model. Attention layers often carry
the most transferable information, but some pretraining rules impart useful
structure to MLP blocks instead. Most interestingly, the structures induced by
multiple rules can be composed to jointly reinforce multiple capabilities.
These results suggest an exciting possibility of disentangling the acquisition
of knowledge from reasoning in language models, with the goal of improving
their robustness and data efficiency.

Conclusion: 提出基于权重空间特性的新方法，显著提升对重新学习攻击的抵抗能力。

Abstract: Recent unlearning methods for LLMs are vulnerable to relearning attacks:
knowledge believed-to-be-unlearned re-emerges by fine-tuning on a small set of
(even seemingly-unrelated) examples. We study this phenomenon in a controlled
setting for example-level unlearning in vision classifiers. We make the
surprising discovery that forget-set accuracy can recover from around 50%
post-unlearning to nearly 100% with fine-tuning on just the retain set -- i.e.,
zero examples of the forget set. We observe this effect across a wide variety
of unlearning methods, whereas for a model retrained from scratch excluding the
forget set (gold standard), the accuracy remains at 50%. We observe that
resistance to relearning attacks can be predicted by weight-space properties,
specifically, $L_2$-distance and linear mode connectivity between the original
and the unlearned model. Leveraging this insight, we propose a new class of
methods that achieve state-of-the-art resistance to relearning attacks.

perform comprehensive ablation studies on the core components of our training
pipeline to validate their effectiveness. Additionally, we thoroughly
investigate the phenomenon of entropy collapse, identify key factors affecting
entropy dynamics, and demonstrate that mitigating premature entropy collapse is
critical for improved test performance. To support community research, we fully
open-source our model weights, training code, and training datasets.

Motivation: 现有BPS模型评估方法存在两个主要问题：一是将模拟视为预测问题，无法准确评估模型对当前流程的捕捉能力；二是过度依赖Earth Mover's Distance指标，可能掩盖时间模式。

Method: 提出了一种新框架，通过比较基于模拟数据和真实数据训练的预测流程监控模型在下游任务中的表现，评估BPS模型的准确性。

Result: 实证结果表明，该框架不仅能识别差异来源，还能区分模型准确性和数据复杂性，为BPS质量评估提供了更有效的方法。

Conclusion: 新框架为BPS模型评估提供了更全面和准确的视角，有助于优化业务流程模拟的可靠性。

Abstract: Business process simulation (BPS) is a key tool for analyzing and optimizing
organizational workflows, supporting decision-making by estimating the impact
of process changes. The reliability of such estimates depends on the ability of
a BPS model to accurately mimic the process under analysis, making rigorous
accuracy evaluation essential. However, the state-of-the-art approach to
evaluating BPS models has two key limitations. First, it treats simulation as a
forecasting problem, testing whether models can predict unseen future events.
This fails to assess how well a model captures the as-is process, particularly
when process behavior changes from train to test period. Thus, it becomes
difficult to determine whether poor results stem from an inaccurate model or
the inherent complexity of the data, such as unpredictable drift. Second, the
evaluation approach strongly relies on Earth Mover's Distance-based metrics,
which can obscure temporal patterns and thus yield misleading conclusions about
simulation quality. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework that
evaluates simulation quality based on its ability to generate representative
process behavior. Instead of comparing simulated logs to future real-world
executions, we evaluate whether predictive process monitoring models trained on
simulated data perform comparably to those trained on real data for downstream
analysis tasks. Empirical results show that our framework not only helps
identify sources of discrepancies but also distinguishes between model accuracy
and data complexity, offering a more meaningful way to assess BPS quality.

Method: 通过相对距离比量化每个样本的记忆化程度，分析记忆化动态，并提出DynamicCut方法：按记忆化强度排序样本，剪枝部分样本后重新训练。

Result: 实验显示记忆化分布呈重尾分布，少数样本贡献大部分泄露。DynamicCut能有效减少记忆化，且对数据多样性和性能影响小。

Conclusion: DynamicCut是一种模型无关的隐私保护方法，可跨模型迁移，适用于多种生成模型。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong performance in generating high-quality
tabular data, but they carry privacy risks by reproducing exact training
samples. While prior work focuses on dataset-level augmentation to reduce
memorization, little is known about which individual samples contribute most.
We present the first data-centric study of memorization dynamics in tabular
diffusion models. We quantify memorization for each real sample based on how
many generated samples are flagged as replicas, using a relative distance
ratio. Our empirical analysis reveals a heavy-tailed distribution of
memorization counts: a small subset of samples contributes disproportionately
to leakage, confirmed via sample-removal experiments. To understand this, we
divide real samples into top- and non-top-memorized groups and analyze their
training-time behaviors. We track when each sample is first memorized and
monitor per-epoch memorization intensity (AUC). Memorized samples are memorized
slightly earlier and show stronger signals in early training. Based on these
insights, we propose DynamicCut, a two-stage, model-agnostic mitigation method:
(a) rank samples by epoch-wise intensity, (b) prune a tunable top fraction, and
(c) retrain on the filtered dataset. Across multiple tabular datasets and
models, DynamicCut reduces memorization with minimal impact on data diversity
and downstream performance. It also complements augmentation-based defenses.
Furthermore, DynamicCut enables cross-model transferability: high-ranked
samples identified from one model (e.g., a diffusion model) are also effective
for reducing memorization when removed from others, such as GANs and VAEs.

Conclusion: PEFT在复杂任务中表现不如FFT，未来研究需超越现有PEFT框架。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods achieve performance comparable
to Full Fine-Tuning (FFT) while requiring significantly fewer computing
resources, making it the go-to choice for researchers. We find that although
PEFT can achieve competitive results on some benchmarks, its performance falls
short of FFT in complex tasks, such as reasoning and instruction-based
fine-tuning. In this paper, we compare the characteristics of PEFT and FFT in
terms of representational capacity and robustness based on optimization theory.
We theoretically demonstrate that PEFT is a strict subset of FFT. By providing
theoretical upper bounds for PEFT, we show that the limited parameter space
constrains the model's representational ability, making it more susceptible to
perturbations. Experiments on 15 datasets encompassing classification,
generation, reasoning, instruction fine-tuning tasks and 11 adversarial test
sets validate our theories. We hope that these results spark further research
beyond the realms of well established PEFT. The source code is in the anonymous

Abstract: Deploying machine learning models in safety-critical domains poses a key
challenge: ensuring reliable model performance on downstream user data without
access to ground truth labels for direct validation. We propose the suitability
filter, a novel framework designed to detect performance deterioration by
utilizing suitability signals -- model output features that are sensitive to
covariate shifts and indicative of potential prediction errors. The suitability
filter evaluates whether classifier accuracy on unlabeled user data shows
significant degradation compared to the accuracy measured on the labeled test
dataset. Specifically, it ensures that this degradation does not exceed a
pre-specified margin, which represents the maximum acceptable drop in accuracy.
To achieve reliable performance evaluation, we aggregate suitability signals
for both test and user data and compare these empirical distributions using
statistical hypothesis testing, thus providing insights into decision
uncertainty. Our modular method adapts to various models and domains. Empirical
evaluations across different classification tasks demonstrate that the
suitability filter reliably detects performance deviations due to covariate
shift. This enables proactive mitigation of potential failures in high-stakes
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在持续学习场景中常因灾难性遗忘导致性能下降，现有方法因固定预算分配或多阶段优化而存在局限性。

Method: OA-Adapter通过动态瓶颈维度适应机制，统一预算分配与任务优化，并应用正交约束保护历史任务知识。

Result: 实验表明，OA-Adapter在标准持续学习基准上准确率更高，且参数效率提升58.5%。

Conclusion: OA-Adapter通过动态预算与正交学习的结合，显著提升了持续学习的性能与效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from catastrophic forgetting in
continual learning (CL) scenarios, where performance on previously learned
tasks degrades severely while training on sequentially arriving tasks. Although
pioneering CL approaches using orthogonal subspaces can mitigate task
interference, they typically employ fixed budget allocation, neglecting the
varying complexity across tasks and layers. Besides, recent budget-adaptive
tuning methods for LLMs often adopt multi-stage paradigms that decouple
optimization and budget allocation. Such decoupling results in potential
misalignment, which hinders those approaches' practical application in CL
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose OA-Adapter, a novel
parameter-efficient approach for continual learning in LLMs that unifies
dynamic budget adaptation with orthogonal subspace learning in a single
end-to-end training stage. Specifically, OA-Adapter introduces a dynamic
bottleneck dimension adaptation mechanism that simultaneously allocates an
efficient parameter budget and optimizes task objectives without misalignment.
To effectively preserve previously acquired knowledge while coordinating with
the dynamic budget allocation, orthogonal constraints are applied specifically
between the parameter subspace of the current task and the dynamically
allocated parameter subspaces of historical tasks. Experimental results on
continual learning benchmarks demonstrate that OA-Adapter outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and parameter efficiency, achieving
higher average accuracy while using 58.5% fewer parameters on the standard CL
benchmark.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨多类分类中梯度下降的泛化性能，填补了以往研究主要集中在二分类的空白。

Method: 分析梯度下降在损失函数衰减至零时的风险上界，特别关注损失模板的几何性质。

Result: 发现风险上界与损失模板的几何性质密切相关，$p=\infty$时风险对数依赖于$k$，$p=2$时线性依赖于$k$。

Conclusion: 损失模板的几何性质在多类分类中起决定性作用，为未来研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: We study the generalization performance of unregularized gradient methods for
separable linear classification. While previous work mostly deal with the
binary case, we focus on the multiclass setting with $k$ classes and establish
novel population risk bounds for Gradient Descent for loss functions that decay
to zero. In this setting, we show risk bounds that reveal that convergence
rates are crucially influenced by the geometry of the loss template, as
formalized by Wang and Scott (2024), rather than of the loss function itself.
Particularly, we establish risk upper bounds that holds for any decay rate of
the loss whose template is smooth with respect to the $p$-norm. In the case of
exponentially decaying losses, our results indicates a contrast between the
$p=\infty$ case, where the risk exhibits a logarithmic dependence on $k$, and
$p=2$ where the risk scales linearly with $k$. To establish this separation
formally, we also prove a lower bound in the latter scenario, demonstrating
that the polynomial dependence on $k$ is unavoidable. Central to our analysis
is a novel bound on the Rademacher complexity of low-noise vector-valued linear
predictors with a loss template smooth w.r.t.~general $p$-norms.

Abstract: This paper studies a bandit optimization problem where the goal is to
maximize a function $f(x)$ over $T$ periods for some unknown strongly concave
function $f$. We consider a new pairwise comparison oracle, where the
decision-maker chooses a pair of actions $(x, x')$ for a consecutive number of
periods and then obtains an estimate of $f(x)-f(x')$. We show that such a
pairwise comparison oracle finds important applications to joint pricing and
inventory replenishment problems and network revenue management. The challenge
in this bandit optimization is twofold. First, the decision-maker not only
needs to determine a pair of actions $(x, x')$ but also a stopping time $n$
(i.e., the number of queries based on $(x, x')$). Second, motivated by our
inventory application, the estimate of the difference $f(x)-f(x')$ is biased,
which is different from existing oracles in stochastic optimization literature.
To address these challenges, we first introduce a discretization technique and
local polynomial approximation to relate this problem to linear bandits. Then
we developed a tournament successive elimination technique to localize the
discretized cell and run an interactive batched version of LinUCB algorithm on
cells. We establish regret bounds that are optimal up to poly-logarithmic
factors. Furthermore, we apply our proposed algorithm and analytical framework
to the two operations management problems and obtain results that improve
state-of-the-art results in the existing literature.

Conclusion: DHGNN通过门控机制捕捉方向性同质性差异，为复杂图结构上的消息传递行为提供了深入见解。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in various
learning tasks on graph-structured data. Nevertheless, most GNNs struggle to
generalize to heterophilic neighborhoods. Additionally, many GNNs ignore the
directional nature of real-world graphs, resulting in suboptimal performance on
directed graphs with asymmetric structures. In this work, we propose Directed
Homophily-aware Graph Neural Network (DHGNN), a novel framework that addresses
these limitations by incorporating homophily-aware and direction-sensitive
components. DHGNN employs a resettable gating mechanism to adaptively modulate
message contributions based on homophily levels and informativeness, and a
structure-aware noise-tolerant fusion module to effectively integrate node
representations from the original and reverse directions. Extensive experiments
on both homophilic and heterophilic directed graph datasets demonstrate that
DHGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification and link
prediction. In particular, DHGNN improves over the best baseline by up to
15.07% in link prediction. Our analysis further shows that the gating mechanism
captures directional homophily gaps and fluctuating homophily across layers,
providing deeper insights into message-passing behavior on complex graph
structures.

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，SplitLoRA方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SplitLoRA通过优化梯度空间划分，有效平衡了持续学习中的稳定性和可塑性，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Continual Learning requires a model to learn multiple tasks in sequence while
maintaining both stability:preserving knowledge from previously learned tasks,
and plasticity:effectively learning new tasks. Gradient projection has emerged
as an effective and popular paradigm in CL, where it partitions the gradient
space of previously learned tasks into two orthogonal subspaces: a primary
subspace and a minor subspace. New tasks are learned effectively within the
minor subspace, thereby reducing interference with previously acquired
knowledge. However, existing Gradient Projection methods struggle to achieve an
optimal balance between plasticity and stability, as it is hard to
appropriately partition the gradient space. In this work, we consider a
continual learning paradigm based on Low-Rank Adaptation, which has gained
considerable attention due to its efficiency and wide applicability, and
propose a novel approach for continual learning, called SplitLoRA. We first
provide a theoretical analysis of how subspace partitioning affects model
stability and plasticity. Informed by this analysis, we then introduce an
effective method that derives the optimal partition of the gradient space for
previously learned tasks. This approach effectively balances stability and
plasticity in continual learning. Experimental results on multiple datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有案例到达模型过于简化，无法准确反映组织环境中的动态变化，导致模拟结果不准确。

Method: 提出Auto Time Kernel Density Estimation (AT-KDE)方法，结合全局动态、周内变化和日内分布变化，提高建模精度和可扩展性。

Result: 在20个不同流程上的实验表明，AT-KDE比现有方法更准确、鲁棒，且执行效率合理。

Conclusion: AT-KDE显著提升了业务流程模拟的准确性和可靠性，适用于复杂动态环境。

Abstract: Business Process Simulation (BPS) is a critical tool for analyzing and
improving organizational processes by estimating the impact of process changes.
A key component of BPS is the case-arrival model, which determines the pattern
of new case entries into a process. Although accurate case-arrival modeling is
essential for reliable simulations, as it influences waiting and overall cycle
times, existing approaches often rely on oversimplified static distributions of
inter-arrival times. These approaches fail to capture the dynamic and temporal
complexities inherent in organizational environments, leading to less accurate
and reliable outcomes. To address this limitation, we propose Auto Time Kernel
Density Estimation (AT-KDE), a divide-and-conquer approach that models arrival
times of processes by incorporating global dynamics, day-of-week variations,
and intraday distributional changes, ensuring both precision and scalability.
Experiments conducted across 20 diverse processes demonstrate that AT-KDE is
far more accurate and robust than existing approaches while maintaining
sensible execution time efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Perturb-and-Merge (P&M)的新框架，通过模型合并技术缓解持续学习中的遗忘问题，并结合LoRA减少内存开销，在多个基准数据集上达到最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法仅依赖最近任务的参数进行推理，容易导致灾难性遗忘，因此需要一种更有效的方法来缓解这一问题。

Method: P&M框架在每项任务训练后，通过构建前一个模型与新任务特定模型的凸组合来形成新模型，并通过理论分析优化合并系数。此外，引入基于任务向量和Hessian矩阵的正则化项，并通过二阶对称有限差分高效近似。

Result: P&M在多个持续学习基准数据集上实现了最优性能。

Conclusion: P&M通过模型合并和正则化技术有效缓解了持续学习中的遗忘问题，结合LoRA进一步提升了效率。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) aims to enable models to continuously acquire new
knowledge from a sequence of tasks with avoiding the forgetting of learned
information. However, existing CL methods only rely on the parameters of the
most recent task for inference, which makes them susceptible to catastrophic
forgetting. Inspired by the recent success of model merging techniques, we
propose \textbf{Perturb-and-Merge (P\&M)}, a novel continual learning framework
that integrates model merging into the CL paradigm to mitigate forgetting.
Specifically, after training on each task, P\&M constructs a new model by
forming a convex combination of the previous model and the newly trained
task-specific model. Through theoretical analysis, we minimize the total loss
increase across all tasks and derive an analytical solution for the optimal
merging coefficient. To further improve the performance of the merged model, we
observe that the degradation introduced during merging can be alleviated by a
regularization term composed of the task vector and the Hessian matrix of the
loss function. Interestingly, we show that this term can be efficiently
approximated using second-order symmetric finite differences, and a stochastic
perturbation strategy along the task vector direction is accordingly devised
which incurs no additional forward or backward passes while providing an
effective approximation of the regularization term. Finally, we combine P\&M
with LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, to reduce memory overhead.
Our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
continual learning benchmark datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在建模物理系统时存在约束难以直接施加的问题，导致生成精度与物理约束之间的权衡。

Method: 通过后处理蒸馏阶段施加物理约束，而非直接注入扩散过程，实现单步生成和更高的PDE满足度。

Result: 实验表明，PIDDM在多个PDE基准测试中显著优于基线方法，且计算开销更低。

Conclusion: PIDDM为在扩散模型中高效融入物理约束提供了新思路。

Abstract: Modeling physical systems in a generative manner offers several advantages,
including the ability to handle partial observations, generate diverse
solutions, and address both forward and inverse problems. Recently, diffusion
models have gained increasing attention in the modeling of physical systems,
particularly those governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). However,
diffusion models only access noisy data $\boldsymbol{x}_t$ at intermediate
steps, making it infeasible to directly enforce constraints on the clean sample
$\boldsymbol{x}_0$ at each noisy level. As a workaround, constraints are
typically applied to the expectation of clean samples
$\mathbb{E}[\boldsymbol{x}_0|\boldsymbol{x}_t]$, which is estimated using the
learned score network. However, imposing PDE constraints on the expectation
does not strictly represent the one on the true clean data, known as Jensen's
Gap. This gap creates a trade-off: enforcing PDE constraints may come at the
cost of reduced accuracy in generative modeling. To address this, we propose a
simple yet effective post-hoc distillation approach, where PDE constraints are
not injected directly into the diffusion process, but instead enforced during a
post-hoc distillation stage. We term our method as Physics-Informed
Distillation of Diffusion Models (PIDDM). This distillation not only
facilitates single-step generation with improved PDE satisfaction, but also
support both forward and inverse problem solving and reconstruction from
randomly partial observation. Extensive experiments across various PDE
benchmarks demonstrate that PIDDM significantly improves PDE satisfaction over
several recent and competitive baselines, such as PIDM, DiffusionPDE, and
ECI-sampling, with less computation overhead. Our approach can shed light on
more efficient and effective strategies for incorporating physical constraints
into diffusion models.

Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在推理过程中常出现过度思考现象，导致计算开销增加。本文旨在通过机制可解释性研究缓解这一问题。

Method: 研究发现过度思考现象与低维流形相关，提出Manifold Steering方法，将干预方向投影到低维流形以减少噪声干扰。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在DeepSeek-R1模型上减少了71%的输出标记，同时保持甚至提高了数学基准的准确性，并具有跨领域迁移能力。

Conclusion: Manifold Steering方法有效缓解了过度思考问题，显著提升了模型效率，且具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in solving complex tasks such as mathematics and coding. However,
these models frequently exhibit a phenomenon known as overthinking during
inference, characterized by excessive validation loops and redundant
deliberation, leading to substantial computational overheads. In this paper, we
aim to mitigate overthinking by investigating the underlying mechanisms from
the perspective of mechanistic interpretability. We first showcase that the
tendency of overthinking can be effectively captured by a single direction in
the model's activation space and the issue can be eased by intervening the
activations along this direction. However, this efficacy soon reaches a plateau
and even deteriorates as the intervention strength increases. We therefore
systematically explore the activation space and find that the overthinking
phenomenon is actually tied to a low-dimensional manifold, which indicates that
the limited effect stems from the noises introduced by the high-dimensional
steering direction. Based on this insight, we propose Manifold Steering, a
novel approach that elegantly projects the steering direction onto the
low-dimensional activation manifold given the theoretical approximation of the
interference noise. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1 distilled models
validate that our method reduces output tokens by up to 71% while maintaining
and even improving the accuracy on several mathematical benchmarks. Our method
also exhibits robust cross-domain transferability, delivering consistent token
reduction performance in code generation and knowledge-based QA tasks. Code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于赌博算法的置信区间构造方法，优于现有方法，并证明了其宽度最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在固定时间设置下要么次优，要么缺乏理论保证，需要更优的解决方案。

Method: 使用赌博算法，每一步选择最优策略，而非固定策略。

Result: 新方法在实证中优于竞争对手，且置信区间宽度接近最优。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了理论空白，提供了更优的置信区间构造方案。

Abstract: The construction of confidence intervals for the mean of a bounded random
variable is a classical problem in statistics with numerous applications in
machine learning and virtually all scientific fields. In particular, obtaining
the tightest possible confidence intervals is vital every time the sampling of
the random variables is expensive. The current state-of-the-art method to
construct confidence intervals is by using betting algorithms. This is a very
successful approach for deriving optimal confidence sequences, even matching
the rate of law of iterated logarithms. However, in the fixed horizon setting,
these approaches are either sub-optimal or based on heuristic solutions with
strong empirical performance but without a finite-time guarantee. Hence, no
betting-based algorithm guaranteeing the optimal
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2\log\frac1\delta}{n}})$ width of the
confidence intervals are known. This work bridges this gap. We propose a
betting-based algorithm to compute confidence intervals that empirically
outperforms the competitors. Our betting strategy uses the optimal strategy in
every step (in a certain sense), whereas the standard betting methods choose a
constant strategy in advance. Leveraging this fact results in strict
improvements even for classical concentration inequalities, such as the ones of
Hoeffding or Bernstein. Moreover, we also prove that the width of our
confidence intervals is optimal up to an $1+o(1)$ factor diminishing with $n$.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在复杂推理任务中因Transformer架构效率低下和缺乏结构化微调而面临的瓶颈。

Method: 采用状态空间双层（SSD）架构替代自注意力机制，提出基于PromptCoT的两阶段课程微调策略。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，模型表现优于同类Transformer和混合模型，甚至超过更大规模的Gemma3-27B。

Conclusion: 状态空间模型有望成为高效且可扩展的替代方案，适用于高容量推理任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advances in complex
reasoning tasks, yet they remain bottlenecked by two core challenges:
architectural inefficiency due to reliance on Transformers, and a lack of
structured fine-tuning for high-difficulty domains. We introduce \ourmodel, an
attention-free language model that addresses both issues through architectural
and data-centric innovations. Built on the state space dual (SSD) layers of
Mamba-2, our model eliminates the need for self-attention and key-value
caching, enabling fixed-memory, constant-time inference. To train it for
complex reasoning, we propose a two-phase curriculum fine-tuning strategy based
on the \textsc{PromptCoT} synthesis paradigm, which generates pedagogically
structured problems via abstract concept selection and rationale-guided
generation. On benchmark evaluations, \ourmodel-7B outperforms strong
Transformer and hybrid models of comparable scale, and even surpasses the much
larger Gemma3-27B by 2.6\% on AIME 24, 0.6\% on AIME 25, and 3.0\% on
Livecodebench. These results highlight the potential of state space models as
efficient and scalable alternatives to attention-based architectures for
high-capacity reasoning.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of wireless technologies necessitates automated design
frameworks to address antenna miniaturization and performance optimization
within constrained development cycles. This study demonstrates a machine
learning enhanced workflow integrating Quantum-Behaved Dynamic Particle Swarm
Optimization (QDPSO) with ANSYS HFSS simulations to accelerate antenna design.
The QDPSO algorithm autonomously optimized loop dimensions in 11.53 seconds,
achieving a resonance frequency of 1.4208 GHz a 12.7 percent reduction compared
to conventional 1.60 GHz designs. Machine learning models (SVM, Random Forest,
XGBoost, and Stacked ensembles) predicted resonance frequencies in 0.75 seconds
using 936 simulation datasets, with stacked models showing superior training
accuracy (R2=0.9825) and SVM demonstrating optimal validation performance
(R2=0.7197). The complete design cycle, encompassing optimization, prediction,
and ANSYS validation, required 12.42 minutes on standard desktop hardware
(Intel i5-8500, 16GB RAM), contrasting sharply with the 50-hour benchmark of
PSADEA-based approaches. This 240 times of acceleration eliminates traditional
trial-and-error methods that often extend beyond seven expert-led days. The
system enables precise specifications of performance targets with automated
generation of fabrication-ready parameters, particularly benefiting compact
consumer devices requiring rapid frequency tuning. By bridging AI-driven
optimization with CAD validation, this framework reduces engineering workloads
while ensuring production-ready designs, establishing a scalable paradigm for
next-generation RF systems in 6G and IoT applications.

Conclusion: SOReL和TOReL为离线RL的安全性和可靠性迈出了重要一步，推动了RL在现实世界的应用。

Abstract: Sample efficiency remains a major obstacle for real world adoption of
reinforcement learning (RL): success has been limited to settings where
simulators provide access to essentially unlimited environment interactions,
which in reality are typically costly or dangerous to obtain. Offline RL in
principle offers a solution by exploiting offline data to learn a near-optimal
policy before deployment. In practice, however, current offline RL methods rely
on extensive online interactions for hyperparameter tuning, and have no
reliable bound on their initial online performance. To address these two
issues, we introduce two algorithms. Firstly, SOReL: an algorithm for safe
offline reinforcement learning. Using only offline data, our Bayesian approach
infers a posterior over environment dynamics to obtain a reliable estimate of
the online performance via the posterior predictive uncertainty. Crucially, all
hyperparameters are also tuned fully offline. Secondly, we introduce TOReL: a
tuning for offline reinforcement learning algorithm that extends our
information rate based offline hyperparameter tuning methods to general offline
RL approaches. Our empirical evaluation confirms SOReL's ability to accurately
estimate regret in the Bayesian setting whilst TOReL's offline hyperparameter
tuning achieves competitive performance with the best online hyperparameter
tuning methods using only offline data. Thus, SOReL and TOReL make a
significant step towards safe and reliable offline RL, unlocking the potential
for RL in the real world. Our implementations are publicly available:

Conclusion: 呼吁研究社区更多投入指标开发，并为实践者提供指标使用指南。

Abstract: Any method's development and practical application is limited by our ability
to measure its reliability. The popularity of generative modeling emphasizes
the importance of good synthetic data metrics. Unfortunately, previous works
have found many failure cases in current metrics, for example lack of outlier
robustness and unclear lower and upper bounds. We propose a list of desiderata
for synthetic data metrics, and a suite of sanity checks: carefully chosen
simple experiments that aim to detect specific and known generative modeling
failure modes. Based on these desiderata and the results of our checks, we
arrive at our position: all current generative fidelity and diversity metrics
are flawed. This significantly hinders practical use of synthetic data. Our aim
is to convince the research community to spend more effort in developing
metrics, instead of models. Additionally, through analyzing how current metrics
fail, we provide practitioners with guidelines on how these metrics should
(not) be used.

Track-and-Stop, which generalizes both Track-and-Stop and Sticky

our analysis also highlights special cases where existing methods enjoy
optimality.

Abstract: The forecasting of multivariate urban data presents a complex challenge due

time-series variables. The proposed model incorporates a decomposition-based
preprocessing step, isolating trend, seasonal, and residual components to
enhance the accuracy and interpretability of forecasts. By leveraging the
dynamic capabilities of GNNs, the model effectively captures interdependencies
and improves the forecasting performance. Extensive experiments on real-world
datasets, including electricity usage, weather metrics, carbon intensity, and
air pollution data, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
across various forecasting scenarios. The results highlight the potential of
the model to optimize smart infrastructure systems, contributing to
energy-efficient urban development and enhanced public well-being.

Conclusion: 填补了两种算法在非渐近性能分析上的空白。

Abstract: In pure exploration problems, a statistician sequentially collects
information to answer a question about some stochastic and unknown environment.
The probability of returning a wrong answer should not exceed a maximum risk
parameter $\delta$ and good algorithms make as few queries to the environment
as possible. The Track-and-Stop algorithm is a pioneering method to solve these
problems. Specifically, it is well-known that it enjoys asymptotic optimality
sample complexity guarantees for $\delta\to 0$ whenever the map from the
environment to its correct answers is single-valued (e.g., best-arm
identification with a unique optimal arm). The Sticky Track-and-Stop algorithm
extends these results to settings where, for each environment, there might
exist multiple correct answers (e.g., $\epsilon$-optimal arm identification).
Although both methods are optimal in the asymptotic regime, their
non-asymptotic guarantees remain unknown. In this work, we fill this gap and
provide non-asymptotic guarantees for both algorithms.

Abstract: We aim to develop a fundamental understanding of modality collapse, a
recently observed empirical phenomenon wherein models trained for multimodal
fusion tend to rely only on a subset of the modalities, ignoring the rest. We
show that modality collapse happens when noisy features from one modality are
entangled, via a shared set of neurons in the fusion head, with predictive
features from another, effectively masking out positive contributions from the
predictive features of the former modality and leading to its collapse. We
further prove that cross-modal knowledge distillation implicitly disentangles
such representations by freeing up rank bottlenecks in the student encoder,
denoising the fusion-head outputs without negatively impacting the predictive
features from either modality. Based on the above findings, we propose an
algorithm that prevents modality collapse through explicit basis reallocation,
with applications in dealing with missing modalities. Extensive experiments on
multiple multimodal benchmarks validate our theoretical claims. Project page:

Conclusion: 能量视角为对抗训练和生成模型提供了新见解，DER和生成改进技术具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We aim at using Energy-based Model (EBM) framework to better understand
adversarial training (AT) in classifiers, and additionally to analyze the
intrinsic generative capabilities of robust classifiers. By viewing standard
classifiers through an energy lens, we begin by analyzing how the energies of
adversarial examples, generated by various attacks, differ from those of the
natural samples. The central focus of our work is to understand the critical
phenomena of Catastrophic Overfitting (CO) and Robust Overfitting (RO) in AT
from an energy perspective. We analyze the impact of existing AT approaches on
the energy of samples during training and observe that the behavior of the
``delta energy' -- change in energy between original sample and its adversarial
counterpart -- diverges significantly when CO or RO occurs. After a thorough
analysis of these energy dynamics and their relationship with overfitting, we
propose a novel regularizer, the Delta Energy Regularizer (DER), designed to
smoothen the energy landscape during training. We demonstrate that DER is
effective in mitigating both CO and RO across multiple benchmarks. We further
show that robust classifiers, when being used as generative models, have limits
in handling trade-off between image quality and variability. We propose an
improved technique based on a local class-wise principal component analysis
(PCA) and energy-based guidance for better class-specific initialization and
adaptive stopping, enhancing sample diversity and generation quality.
Considering that we do not explicitly train for generative modeling, we achieve
a competitive Inception Score (IS) and Fr\'echet inception distance (FID)
compared to hybrid discriminative-generative models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了标准参数化（SP）在训练大规模视觉和语言模型时的表现，发现交叉熵损失（CE）下存在一个可控发散机制，使得大学习率下仍能稳定训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论无法解释标准参数化在实践中的成功，尤其是大学习率下的稳定性和特征学习能力。

Method: 通过分析神经网络训练动态，证明交叉熵损失下的可控发散机制是关键。

Result: 实验验证了CE损失下可控发散机制的存在，并表明宽度缩放对学习率预测有用。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了CE损失下大学习率稳定训练的机制，并澄清了层学习率缩放的有效性。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training large-scale vision and language models is
He initialization and a single global learning rate (\textit{standard
parameterization}, SP). Despite its practical success, standard parametrization
remains poorly understood from a theoretical perspective: Existing
infinite-width theory would predict instability under large learning rates and
vanishing feature learning under stable learning rates. However, empirically
optimal learning rates consistently decay much slower than theoretically
predicted. By carefully studying neural network training dynamics, we
demonstrate that this discrepancy is not fully explained by finite-width
phenomena such as catapult effects or a lack of alignment between weights and
incoming activations. We instead show that the apparent contradiction can be
fundamentally resolved by taking the loss function into account: In contrast to
Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss, we prove that under cross-entropy (CE) loss, an
intermediate \textit{controlled divergence} regime emerges, where logits
diverge but loss, gradients, and activations remain stable. Stable training
under large learning rates enables persistent feature evolution at scale in all
hidden layers, which is crucial for the practical success of SP. In experiments
across optimizers (SGD, Adam), architectures (MLPs, GPT) and data modalities
(vision, language), we validate that neural networks operate in this controlled
divergence regime under CE loss but not under MSE loss. Our empirical evidence
suggests that width-scaling considerations are surprisingly useful for
predicting empirically optimal learning rate exponents. Finally, our analysis
clarifies the effectiveness and limitations of recently proposed layerwise
learning rate scalings for standard initialization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了强化学习中的离策略评估（OPE），重点分析了重要性采样中行为策略估计的作用。研究发现，即使真实行为策略是马尔可夫的，估计历史依赖的行为策略也能降低均方误差（MSE）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明，历史依赖的行为策略估计能降低MSE，但其原因尚不明确。本文旨在从理论上解释这一现象。

Method: 通过推导普通重要性采样（IS）估计器的MSE的偏差-方差分解，分析了历史依赖行为策略估计对偏差和方差的影响。

Result: 研究发现，历史依赖的行为策略估计会降低渐近方差，但增加有限样本偏差。随着历史长度的增加，方差持续减小。

Conclusion: 该理论分析适用于多种OPE估计器，包括序列IS估计器、双重稳健估计器和边缘化IS估计器，无论参数化或非参数化估计。

Abstract: This paper studies off-policy evaluation (OPE) in reinforcement learning with
a focus on behavior policy estimation for importance sampling. Prior work has
shown empirically that estimating a history-dependent behavior policy can lead
to lower mean squared error (MSE) even when the true behavior policy is
Markovian. However, the question of why the use of history should lower MSE
remains open. In this paper, we theoretically demystify this paradox by
deriving a bias-variance decomposition of the MSE of ordinary importance
sampling (IS) estimators, demonstrating that history-dependent behavior policy
estimation decreases their asymptotic variances while increasing their
finite-sample biases. Additionally, as the estimated behavior policy conditions
on a longer history, we show a consistent decrease in variance. We extend these
findings to a range of other OPE estimators, including the sequential IS
estimator, the doubly robust estimator and the marginalized IS estimator, with
the behavior policy estimated either parametrically or non-parametrically.

Conclusion: ProSpero能够高效探索野生型邻域外的序列空间，同时保持生物可行性，为蛋白质工程提供了一种有效工具。

Abstract: Designing protein sequences of both high fitness and novelty is a challenging
task in data-efficient protein engineering. Exploration beyond wild-type
neighborhoods often leads to biologically implausible sequences or relies on
surrogate models that lose fidelity in novel regions. Here, we propose
ProSpero, an active learning framework in which a frozen pre-trained generative
model is guided by a surrogate updated from oracle feedback. By integrating
fitness-relevant residue selection with biologically-constrained Sequential
Monte Carlo sampling, our approach enables exploration beyond wild-type
neighborhoods while preserving biological plausibility. We show that our
framework remains effective even when the surrogate is misspecified. ProSpero
consistently outperforms or matches existing methods across diverse protein
engineering tasks, retrieving sequences of both high fitness and novelty.

Motivation: 核物理实验需要高效追踪高能碰撞产生的带电粒子轨迹，传统组合方法效率低且计算复杂度高，GNN因其对点云数据的天然适应性成为潜在解决方案。

Method: 利用GlueX实验的模拟数据训练GNN模型，并在模拟和真实数据上测试其性能，同时比较GPU和FPGA实现的差异。

Result: GNN在固定纯度下表现出更高的分段效率，且通过GPU批量处理实现显著加速。

Conclusion: GNN在粒子轨迹追踪任务中优于传统方法，尤其在并行计算环境下具有显著优势。

Abstract: Nuclear physics experiments are aimed at uncovering the fundamental building
blocks of matter. The experiments involve high-energy collisions that produce
complex events with many particle trajectories. Tracking charged particles
resulting from collisions in the presence of a strong magnetic field is
critical to enable the reconstruction of particle trajectories and precise
determination of interactions. It is traditionally achieved through
combinatorial approaches that scale worse than linearly as the number of hits
grows. Since particle hit data naturally form a 3-dimensional point cloud and
can be structured as graphs, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) emerge as an
intuitive and effective choice for this task. In this study, we evaluate the
GNN model for track finding on the data from the GlueX experiment at Jefferson
Lab. We use simulation data to train the model and test on both simulation and
real GlueX measurements. We demonstrate that GNN-based track finding
outperforms the currently used traditional method at GlueX in terms of
segment-based efficiency at a fixed purity while providing faster inferences.
We show that the GNN model can achieve significant speedup by processing
multiple events in batches, which exploits the parallel computation capability
of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). Finally, we compare the GNN
implementation on GPU and FPGA and describe the trade-off.

Conclusion: 研究从表示几何的角度解释了稀疏性的原理，强调了理解表示和引入表示约束的必要性，为开发新的可解释工具和改进SAEs提供了实证参考。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a predominant tool in mechanistic
interpretability, aiming to identify interpretable monosemantic features.
However, how does sparse encoding organize the representations of activation
vector from language models? What is the relationship between this
organizational paradigm and feature disentanglement as well as reconstruction
performance? To address these questions, we propose the SAEMA, which validates
the stratified structure of the representation by observing the variability of
the rank of the symmetric semipositive definite (SSPD) matrix corresponding to
the modal tensor unfolded along the latent tensor with the level of noise added
to the residual stream. To systematically investigate how sparse encoding
alters representational structures, we define local and global representations,
demonstrating that they amplify inter-feature distinctions by merging similar
semantic features and introducing additional dimensionality. Furthermore, we
intervene the global representation from an optimization perspective, proving a
significant causal relationship between their separability and the
reconstruction performance. This study explains the principles of sparsity from
the perspective of representational geometry and demonstrates the impact of
changes in representational structure on reconstruction performance.
Particularly emphasizes the necessity of understanding representations and
incorporating representational constraints, providing empirical references for
developing new interpretable tools and improving SAEs. The code is available at

Conclusion: 可微停止时间为算法加速提供了新思路，适用于在线超参数调整和学习优化等场景。

Abstract: Optimization is an important module of modern machine learning applications.
Tremendous efforts have been made to accelerate optimization algorithms. A
common formulation is achieving a lower loss at a given time. This enables a
differentiable framework with respect to the algorithm hyperparameters. In
contrast, its dual, minimizing the time to reach a target loss, is believed to
be non-differentiable, as the time is not differentiable. As a result, it
usually serves as a conceptual framework or is optimized using zeroth-order
methods. To address this limitation, we propose a differentiable stopping time
and theoretically justify it based on differential equations. An efficient
algorithm is designed to backpropagate through it. As a result, the proposed
differentiable stopping time enables a new differentiable formulation for
accelerating algorithms. We further discuss its applications, such as online
hyperparameter tuning and learning to optimize. Our proposed methods show
superior performance in comprehensive experiments across various problems,
which confirms their effectiveness.

Conclusion: 模型选择应根据具体风险容忍度和操作需求，强调了权衡召回率和精度的重要性。

Abstract: Fraud detection remains a critical task in high-stakes domains such as
finance and e-commerce, where undetected fraudulent transactions can lead to
significant economic losses. In this study, we systematically compare the
performance of four supervised learning models - Logistic Regression, Random
Forest, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and a Gated Recurrent Unit
(GRU) network - on a large-scale, highly imbalanced online transaction dataset.
While ensemble methods such as Random Forest and LightGBM demonstrated superior
performance in both overall and class-specific metrics, Logistic Regression
offered a reliable and interpretable baseline. The GRU model showed strong
recall for the minority fraud class, though at the cost of precision,
highlighting a trade-off relevant for real-world deployment. Our evaluation
emphasizes not only weighted averages but also per-class precision, recall, and
F1-scores, providing a nuanced view of each model's effectiveness in detecting
rare but consequential fraudulent activity. The findings underscore the
importance of choosing models based on the specific risk tolerance and
operational needs of fraud detection systems.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have become highly effective across various

to adhere to certain constraints but without task-specific fine-tuning. To this
end, we propose a training-free method based on Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to
sample from the reward-aligned target distribution at the test time. Our
approach leverages twisted SMC with an approximate locally optimal proposal,
obtained via a first-order Taylor expansion of the reward function. To address
the challenge of ill-defined gradients in discrete spaces, we incorporate a
Gumbel-Softmax relaxation, enabling efficient gradient-based approximation
within the discrete generative framework. Empirical results on both synthetic
datasets and image modelling validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: 研究为网络安全领域的AI应用提供了工具和结果，强调了任务多样性和一致表示的重要性。

Abstract: Open-ended learning (OEL) -- which emphasizes training agents that achieve
broad capability over narrow competency -- is emerging as a paradigm to develop
artificial intelligence (AI) agents to achieve robustness and generalization.
However, despite promising results that demonstrate the benefits of OEL,
applying OEL to develop autonomous agents for real-world cybersecurity
applications remains a challenge.
  We propose a training approach, inspired by OEL, to develop autonomous
network defenders. Our results demonstrate that like in other domains, OEL
principles can translate into more robust and generalizable agents for cyber
defense. To apply OEL to network defense, it is necessary to address several
technical challenges. Most importantly, it is critical to provide a task
representation approach over a broad universe of tasks that maintains a
consistent interface over goals, rewards and action spaces. This way, the
learning agent can train with varying network conditions, attacker behaviors,
and defender goals while being able to build on previously gained knowledge.
  With our tools and results, we aim to fundamentally impact research that
applies AI to solve cybersecurity problems. Specifically, as researchers
develop gyms and benchmarks for cyber defense, it is paramount that they
consider diverse tasks with consistent representations, such as those we
propose in our work.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel quantum generative model for synthesizing

Real-world enterprise data is predominantly tabular and heterogeneous, often
comprising a mixture of categorical and numerical features, making it highly
relevant across various industries such as healthcare, finance, and software.
We propose a quantum generative adversarial network architecture with flexible
data encoding and a novel quantum circuit ansatz to effectively model tabular
data. The proposed approach is tested on the MIMIC III healthcare and Adult
Census datasets, with extensive benchmarking against leading classical models,
CTGAN, and CopulaGAN. Experimental results demonstrate that our quantum model
outperforms classical models by an average of 8.5% with respect to an overall
similarity score from SDMetrics, while using only 0.072% of the parameters of
the classical models. Additionally, we evaluate the generalization capabilities
of the models using two custom-designed metrics that demonstrate the ability of
the proposed quantum model to generate useful and novel samples. To our
knowledge, this is one of the first demonstrations of a successful quantum

Conclusion: 提出的框架灵活且实用，可根据任务需求定制不确定性量化方法。

Abstract: We address the problem of uncertainty quantification and propose measures of
total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty based on a known decomposition of
(strictly) proper scoring rules, a specific type of loss function, into a
divergence and an entropy component. This leads to a flexible framework for
uncertainty quantification that can be instantiated with different losses
(scoring rules), which makes it possible to tailor uncertainty quantification
to the use case at hand. We show that this flexibility is indeed advantageous.
In particular, we analyze the task of selective prediction and show that the
scoring rule should ideally match the task loss. In addition, we perform
experiments on two other common tasks. For out-of-distribution detection, our
results confirm that a widely used measure of epistemic uncertainty, mutual
information, performs best. Moreover, in the setting of active learning, our
measure of epistemic uncertainty based on the zero-one-loss consistently
outperforms other uncertainty measures.

Abstract: Deep neural networks form the backbone of artificial intelligence research,
with potential to transform the human experience in areas ranging from
autonomous driving to personal assistants, healthcare to education. However,
their integration into the daily routines of real-world classrooms remains
limited. It is not yet common for a teacher to assign students individualized
homework targeting their specific weaknesses, provide students with instant
feedback, or simulate student responses to a new exam question. While these
models excel in predictive performance, this lack of adoption can be attributed
to a significant weakness: the lack of explainability of model decisions,
leading to a lack of trust from students, parents, and teachers. This thesis
aims to bring human needs to the forefront of eXplainable AI (XAI) research,
grounded in the concrete use case of personalized learning and teaching. We
frame the contributions along two verticals: technical advances in XAI and
their aligned human studies. We investigate explainability in AI for education,
revealing systematic disagreements between post-hoc explainers and identifying
a need for inherently interpretable model architectures. We propose four novel
technical contributions in interpretability with a multimodal modular
architecture (MultiModN), an interpretable mixture-of-experts model
(InterpretCC), adversarial training for explainer stability, and a
theory-driven LLM-XAI framework to present explanations to students
(iLLuMinaTE), which we evaluate in diverse settings with professors, teachers,
learning scientists, and university students. By combining empirical
evaluations of existing explainers with novel architectural designs and human
studies, our work lays a foundation for human-centric AI systems that balance
state-of-the-art performance with built-in transparency and trust.

TL;DR: DES-LOC是一种新型优化器，通过独立同步参数和动量，显著降低通信成本，同时保持收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式数据并行（DDP）方法在基础模型训练中存在带宽限制，现有方法如Local SGD无法直接应用于自适应优化器，且扩展方法缺乏收敛保证或通信成本高。

Method: 提出DES-LOC优化器家族，独立同步参数和动量的周期，降低通信成本。

Result: 在1.7B参数的语言模型上，DES-LOC通信量比DDP少170倍，比Local ADAM少2倍，且适用于易故障的实际训练场景。

Conclusion: DES-LOC为大规模模型训练提供了可扩展、带宽高效且容错的解决方案。

Abstract: Scaling foundation model training with Distributed Data Parallel (DDP)
methods is bandwidth-limited. Existing infrequent communication methods like
Local SGD were designed to synchronize only model parameters and cannot be
trivially applied to adaptive optimizers due to additional optimizer states.
Current approaches extending Local SGD either lack convergence guarantees or
require synchronizing all optimizer states, tripling communication costs. We
propose Desynced Low Communication Adaptive Optimizers (DES-LOC), a family of
optimizers assigning independent synchronization periods to parameters and
momenta, enabling lower communication costs while preserving convergence.
Through extensive experiments on language models of up to 1.7B, we show that
DES-LOC can communicate 170x less than DDP and 2x less than the previous
state-of-the-art Local ADAM. Furthermore, unlike previous heuristic approaches,
DES-LOC is suited for practical training scenarios prone to system failures.
DES-LOC offers a scalable, bandwidth-efficient, and fault-tolerant solution for
foundation model training.

*Artem Moskalev,Mangal Prakash,Junjie Xu,Tianyu Cui,Rui Liao,Tommaso Mansi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Geometric Hyena是一种新型的等变长卷积模型，用于高效处理几何系统的全局上下文信息，同时保持旋转和平移的等变性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生物、化学和物理系统中，处理全局几何上下文并保持等变性至关重要，但现有方法（如等变自注意力）计算复杂度高，而局部方法（如基于距离的消息传递）则牺牲了全局信息。

Method: 受状态空间和长卷积模型的启发，提出了Geometric Hyena模型，通过长卷积捕获全局几何上下文，同时保持等变性。

Result: 在大型RNA分子和蛋白质分子动力学的全原子性质预测任务中，Geometric Hyena优于现有等变模型，计算和内存需求显著降低，处理速度更快。

Conclusion: Geometric Hyena为几何系统提供了一种高效且可扩展的全局上下文建模方法，适用于大规模任务。

Abstract: Processing global geometric context while preserving equivariance is crucial
when modeling biological, chemical, and physical systems. Yet, this is
challenging due to the computational demands of equivariance and global context
at scale. Standard methods such as equivariant self-attention suffer from
quadratic complexity, while local methods such as distance-based message
passing sacrifice global information. Inspired by the recent success of
state-space and long-convolutional models, we introduce Geometric Hyena, the
first equivariant long-convolutional model for geometric systems. Geometric
Hyena captures global geometric context at sub-quadratic complexity while
maintaining equivariance to rotations and translations. Evaluated on all-atom
property prediction of large RNA molecules and full protein molecular dynamics,
Geometric Hyena outperforms existing equivariant models while requiring
significantly less memory and compute that equivariant self-attention. Notably,
our model processes the geometric context of 30k tokens 20x faster than the
equivariant transformer and allows 72x longer context within the same budget.

TL;DR: FNOPE是一种基于傅里叶神经算子和流匹配目标的高效后验估计方法，适用于函数值参数的推断，显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SBI方法在低维参数模型上表现良好，但在函数值参数（如时空过程建模）推断上存在困难。

Method: 采用傅里叶神经算子（FNO）架构和流匹配目标进行高效后验估计。

Result: FNOPE能以较低计算成本推断函数值参数，并支持任意离散化和向量值参数的同时估计。

Conclusion: FNOPE扩展了SBI方法的应用范围，使其适用于函数值参数推断的新科学领域。

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is an established approach for performing
Bayesian inference on scientific simulators. SBI so far works best on
low-dimensional parametric models. However, it is difficult to infer
function-valued parameters, which frequently occur in disciplines that model
spatiotemporal processes such as the climate and earth sciences. Here, we
introduce an approach for efficient posterior estimation, using a Fourier
Neural Operator (FNO) architecture with a flow matching objective. We show that
our approach, FNOPE, can perform inference of function-valued parameters at a
fraction of the simulation budget of state of the art methods. In addition,
FNOPE supports posterior evaluation at arbitrary discretizations of the domain,
as well as simultaneous estimation of vector-valued parameters. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark tasks and a challenging
spatial inference task from glaciology. FNOPE extends the applicability of SBI
methods to new scientific domains by enabling the inference of function-valued
parameters.

TL;DR: 论文研究了带有权重衰减的两层ReLU网络的损失景观，发现在大过参数化条件下（网络宽度m满足m≳min(n^d, 2^n)），景观变得良性（无虚假局部极小值）。同时，这种过参数化是必要且充分的。但结果仅适用于大初始化情况，小初始化仍可能收敛到虚假局部极小值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 权重衰减在神经网络训练中是常见实践，但其理论分析主要集中在无正则化场景。本文旨在填补这一理论空白，研究ℓ2正则化训练损失的景观特性。

Method: 分析两层ReLU网络在ℓ2正则化下的损失景观，探讨网络宽度m与数据点数n和输入维度d的关系。

Result: 在大过参数化（m≳min(n^d, 2^n)）下，损失景观几乎无虚假局部极小值，且每个常数激活区域包含全局极小值。正交数据表明这种过参数化是必要的。

Conclusion: 大过参数化使损失景观良性，但仅适用于大初始化情况。小初始化仍可能导致收敛到虚假局部极小值，表明景观的全局良性不保证优化成功。

Abstract: The optimization of neural networks under weight decay remains poorly
understood from a theoretical standpoint. While weight decay is standard
practice in modern training procedures, most theoretical analyses focus on
unregularized settings. In this work, we investigate the loss landscape of the
$\ell_2$-regularized training loss for two-layer ReLU networks. We show that
the landscape becomes benign -- i.e., free of spurious local minima -- under
large overparametrization, specifically when the network width $m$ satisfies $m
\gtrsim \min(n^d, 2^n)$, where $n$ is the number of data points and $d$ the
input dimension. More precisely in this regime, almost all constant activation
regions contain a global minimum and no spurious local minima. We further show
that this level of overparametrization is not only sufficient but also
necessary via the example of orthogonal data. Finally, we demonstrate that such
loss landscape results primarily hold relevance in the large initialization
regime. In contrast, for small initializations -- corresponding to the feature
learning regime -- optimization can still converge to spurious local minima,
despite the global benignity of the landscape.

Result: 新算法在不同模型类别中提供精确和近似的遗忘保证，实验表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该框架为过参数化设置下的遗忘问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning algorithms aim to remove the influence of specific
training samples, ideally recovering the model that would have resulted from
training on the remaining data alone. We study unlearning in the
overparameterized setting, where many models interpolate the data, and defining
the unlearning solution as any loss minimizer over the retained
set$\unicode{x2013}$as in prior work in the underparameterized
setting$\unicode{x2013}$is inadequate, since the original model may already
interpolate the retained data and satisfy this condition. In this regime, loss
gradients vanish, rendering prior methods based on gradient perturbations
ineffective, motivating both new unlearning definitions and algorithms. For
this setting, we define the unlearning solution as the minimum-complexity
interpolator over the retained data and propose a new algorithmic framework
that only requires access to model gradients on the retained set at the
original solution. We minimize a regularized objective over perturbations
constrained to be orthogonal to these model gradients, a first-order relaxation
of the interpolation condition. For different model classes, we provide exact
and approximate unlearning guarantees, and we demonstrate that an
implementation of our framework outperforms existing baselines across various
unlearning experiments.

Abstract: Sequential learning -- where complex tasks are broken down into simpler,
hierarchical components -- has emerged as a paradigm in AI. This paper views
sequential learning through the lens of low-rank linear regression, focusing
specifically on how errors propagate when learning rank-1 subspaces
sequentially. We present an analysis framework that decomposes the learning
process into a series of rank-1 estimation problems, where each subsequent
estimation depends on the accuracy of previous steps. Our contribution is a
characterization of the error propagation in this sequential process,
establishing bounds on how errors -- e.g., due to limited computational budgets
and finite precision -- affect the overall model accuracy. We prove that these
errors compound in predictable ways, with implications for both algorithmic
design and stability guarantees.

Abstract: This paper aims to overcome a major obstacle in scaling RL for reasoning with
LLMs, namely the collapse of policy entropy. Such phenomenon is consistently
observed across vast RL runs without entropy intervention, where the policy
entropy dropped sharply at the early training stage, this diminished
exploratory ability is always accompanied with the saturation of policy
performance. In practice, we establish a transformation equation R=-a*e^H+b
between entropy H and downstream performance R. This empirical law strongly
indicates that, the policy performance is traded from policy entropy, thus
bottlenecked by its exhaustion, and the ceiling is fully predictable H=0,
R=-a+b. Our finding necessitates entropy management for continuous exploration
toward scaling compute for RL. To this end, we investigate entropy dynamics
both theoretically and empirically. Our derivation highlights that, the change
in policy entropy is driven by the covariance between action probability and
the change in logits, which is proportional to its advantage when using Policy
Gradient-like algorithms. Empirical study shows that, the values of covariance
term and entropy differences matched exactly, supporting the theoretical
conclusion. Moreover, the covariance term stays mostly positive throughout
training, further explaining why policy entropy would decrease monotonically.
Through understanding the mechanism behind entropy dynamics, we motivate to
control entropy by restricting the update of high-covariance tokens.
Specifically, we propose two simple yet effective techniques, namely Clip-Cov
and KL-Cov, which clip and apply KL penalty to tokens with high covariances
respectively. Experiments show that these methods encourage exploration, thus
helping policy escape entropy collapse and achieve better downstream
performance.

Motivation: 探索导向向量在语言模型中的可靠性问题，分析不同提示类型和激活差异几何形状的影响。

Method: 实验研究了七种提示类型，测量了激活差异的余弦相似度，并分析了数据集中正负激活的分离程度。

Result: 所有提示类型均产生正向导向效果，但方差高且常出现反向效果；余弦相似度高的训练集导向更有效；正负激活分离好的数据集更易导向。

Conclusion: 导向向量在目标行为方向不明确时不可靠，需进一步优化提示类型和激活差异几何形状。

Abstract: Steering vectors are a lightweight method to control language model behavior
by adding a learned bias to the activations at inference time. Although
steering demonstrates promising performance, recent work shows that it can be
unreliable or even counterproductive in some cases. This paper studies the
influence of prompt types and the geometry of activation differences on
steering reliability. First, we find that all seven prompt types used in our
experiments produce a net positive steering effect, but exhibit high variance
across samples, and often give an effect opposite of the desired one. No prompt
type clearly outperforms the others, and yet the steering vectors resulting
from the different prompt types often differ directionally (as measured by
cosine similarity). Second, we show that higher cosine similarity between
training set activation differences predicts more effective steering. Finally,
we observe that datasets where positive and negative activations are better
separated are more steerable. Our results suggest that vector steering is
unreliable when the target behavior is not represented by a coherent direction.

Motivation: CoxPH模型在生存分析中广泛应用，但难以扩展到大规模数据集和深度学习架构，尤其是在高维场景下。

Method: 通过发现秩回归与CoxPH模型的基本联系，将谱方法扩展到生存分析，并适用于多种CoxPH变体，包括深度学习模型。

Result: 在多个真实世界高维数据集上验证了方法的可扩展性，其预测性能和效率优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为生存分析提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，适用于多种CoxPH变体。

Abstract: Survival analysis is widely deployed in a diverse set of fields, including
healthcare, business, ecology, etc. The Cox Proportional Hazard (CoxPH) model
is a semi-parametric model often encountered in the literature. Despite its
popularity, wide deployment, and numerous variants, scaling CoxPH to large
datasets and deep architectures poses a challenge, especially in the
high-dimensional regime. We identify a fundamental connection between rank
regression and the CoxPH model: this allows us to adapt and extend the
so-called spectral method for rank regression to survival analysis. Our
approach is versatile, naturally generalizing to several CoxPH variants,
including deep models. We empirically verify our method's scalability on
multiple real-world high-dimensional datasets; our method outperforms legacy
methods w.r.t. predictive performance and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在解决复杂问题时难以进行形式化推理，且形式化非正式问题陈述具有挑战性，因此需要学习可靠的验证器来确保推理步骤的有效性。

Result: 提供了学习满足这些目标的验证器的样本复杂度上界，以及在没有额外假设下学习其他验证目标的下界和不可能性结果。

Conclusion: 论文为自然语言Chain-of-Thought推理的验证问题提供了理论基础和实际指导。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought reasoning has emerged as a powerful approach for solving
complex mathematical and logical problems. However, it can often veer off track
through incorrect or unsubstantiated inferences. Formal mathematical reasoning,
which can be checked with a formal verifier, is one approach to addressing this
issue. However, currently LLMs are simply not good enough to solve complex
problems in a formal way, and even just formalizing an informal problem
statement can be challenging. Motivated by this fact, in this work we consider
the problem of learning reliable verifiers for natural language
Chain-of-Thought reasoning. That is, given a problem statement and step-by-step
solution in natural language, the aim of the verifier is to output [Yes] if the
reasoning steps in the solution are all valid, and [No] otherwise. In this work
we give a formal PAC-learning framework for studying this problem. We propose
and analyze several natural verification goals, at different levels of
strength, in this framework. We provide sample complexity upper-bounds for
learning verifiers satisfying these goals, as well as lower-bound and
impossibility results for learning other natural verification objectives
without additional assumptions.

Conclusion: 通过研究新不确定性方向，LLM交互将更透明、可信和直观。

Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) and chatbot agents are known to provide wrong
outputs at times, and it was recently found that this can never be fully
prevented. Hence, uncertainty quantification plays a crucial role, aiming to
quantify the level of ambiguity in either one overall number or two numbers for
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. This position paper argues that this
traditional dichotomy of uncertainties is too limited for the open and
interactive setup that LLM agents operate in when communicating with a user,
and that we need to research avenues that enrich uncertainties in this novel
scenario. We review the literature and find that popular definitions of
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties directly contradict each other and lose
their meaning in interactive LLM agent settings. Hence, we propose three novel
research directions that focus on uncertainties in such human-computer
interactions: Underspecification uncertainties, for when users do not provide
all information or define the exact task at the first go, interactive learning,
to ask follow-up questions and reduce the uncertainty about the current
context, and output uncertainties, to utilize the rich language and speech
space to express uncertainties as more than mere numbers. We expect that these
new ways of dealing with and communicating uncertainties will lead to LLM agent
interactions that are more transparent, trustworthy, and intuitive.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled machine learning models to achieve
significant advances in many fields. Most recently, RL has empowered frontier
language models to solve challenging math, science, and coding problems.
However, central to any RL algorithm is the reward function, and reward
engineering is a notoriously difficult problem in any domain. In this paper, we
propose RENT: Reinforcement Learning via Entropy Minimization -- a fully
unsupervised RL method that requires no external reward or ground-truth
answers, and instead uses the model's entropy of its underlying distribution as
an intrinsic reward. We find that by reinforcing the chains of thought that
yield high model confidence on its generated answers, the model improves its
reasoning ability. In our experiments, we showcase these improvements on an
extensive suite of commonly-used reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K,
MATH500, AMC, AIME, and GPQA, and models of varying sizes from the Qwen and
Mistral families. The generality of our unsupervised learning method lends
itself to applicability in a wide range of domains where external supervision
is limited or unavailable.

Abstract: We study the fundamental question of how informative a dataset is for solving

information about unknown parameters that influence task outcomes. Focusing on
linear programs, we characterize when a dataset is sufficient to recover an
optimal decision, given an uncertainty set on the cost vector. Our main
contribution is a sharp geometric characterization that identifies the
directions of the cost vector that matter for optimality, relative to the task
constraints and uncertainty set. We further develop a practical algorithm that,
for a given task, constructs a minimal or least-costly sufficient dataset. Our
results reveal that small, well-chosen datasets can often fully determine
optimal decisions -- offering a principled foundation for task-aware data
selection.

Result: PolarGrad在矩阵优化和语言模型预训练任务中表现优于Adam和Muon。

Conclusion: 框架为优化器设计提供新视角，PolarGrad展示了结构感知方法的潜力。

Abstract: The ever-growing scale of deep learning models and datasets underscores the
critical importance of efficient optimization methods. While preconditioned
gradient methods such as Adam and AdamW are the de facto optimizers for
training neural networks and large language models, structure-aware
preconditioned optimizers like Shampoo and Muon, which utilize the matrix
structure of gradients, have demonstrated promising evidence of faster
convergence. In this paper, we introduce a unifying framework for analyzing
"matrix-aware" preconditioned methods, which not only sheds light on the
effectiveness of Muon and related optimizers but also leads to a class of new
structure-aware preconditioned methods. A key contribution of this framework is
its precise distinction between preconditioning strategies that treat neural
network weights as vectors (addressing curvature anisotropy) versus those that
consider their matrix structure (addressing gradient anisotropy). This
perspective provides new insights into several empirical phenomena in language
model pre-training, including Adam's training instabilities, Muon's accelerated
convergence, and the necessity of learning rate warmup for Adam. Building upon
this framework, we introduce PolarGrad, a new class of preconditioned
optimization methods based on the polar decomposition of matrix-valued
gradients. As a special instance, PolarGrad includes Muon with updates scaled
by the nuclear norm of the gradients. We provide numerical implementations of
these methods, leveraging efficient numerical polar decomposition algorithms
for enhanced convergence. Our extensive evaluations across diverse matrix
optimization problems and language model pre-training tasks demonstrate that
PolarGrad outperforms both Adam and Muon.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PADAM的并行平均ADAM优化器，动态选择最优平均变体以减少优化误差，无需额外梯度计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有平均技术（如Ruppert-Polyak和EMA）需根据问题调整参数，PADAM旨在动态选择最优平均策略。

Method: 并行计算多个ADAM平均变体，训练中动态选择误差最小的变体，基于相同梯度计算。

Result: 在13个优化和DNN问题中，PADAM表现优于SGD、动量SGD、ADAM等，优化误差最小。

Conclusion: PADAM适用于科学机器学习问题，并推动DNN训练中自适应平均方法的进一步研究。

Abstract: Averaging techniques such as Ruppert--Polyak averaging and exponential
movering averaging (EMA) are powerful approaches to accelerate optimization
procedures of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization methods such as
the popular ADAM optimizer. However, depending on the specific optimization
problem under consideration, the type and the parameters for the averaging need
to be adjusted to achieve the smallest optimization error. In this work we
propose an averaging approach, which we refer to as parallel averaged ADAM
(PADAM), in which we compute parallely different averaged variants of ADAM and
during the training process dynamically select the variant with the smallest
optimization error. A central feature of this approach is that this procedure
requires no more gradient evaluations than the usual ADAM optimizer as each of
the averaged trajectories relies on the same underlying ADAM trajectory and
thus on the same underlying gradients. We test the proposed PADAM optimizer in
13 stochastic optimization and deep neural network (DNN) learning problems and
compare its performance with known optimizers from the literature such as
standard SGD, momentum SGD, Adam with and without EMA, and ADAMW. In
particular, we apply the compared optimizers to physics-informed neural
network, deep Galerkin, deep backward stochastic differential equation and deep
Kolmogorov approximations for boundary value partial differential equation
problems from scientific machine learning, as well as to DNN approximations for
optimal control and optimal stopping problems. In nearly all of the considered
examples PADAM achieves, sometimes among others and sometimes exclusively,
essentially the smallest optimization error. This work thus strongly suggest to
consider PADAM for scientific machine learning problems and also motivates
further research for adaptive averaging procedures within the training of DNNs.

Abstract: In science, we are interested not only in forecasting but also in
understanding how predictions are made, specifically what the interpretable
underlying model looks like. Data-driven machine learning technology can
significantly streamline the complex and time-consuming traditional manual
process of discovering scientific laws, helping us gain insights into
fundamental issues in modern science. In this work, we introduce a pre-trained
symbolic foundation regressor that can effectively compress complex data with
numerous interacting variables while producing interpretable physical
representations. Our model has been rigorously tested on non-network symbolic
regression, symbolic regression on complex networks, and the inference of
network dynamics across various domains, including physics, biochemistry,
ecology, and epidemiology. The results indicate a remarkable improvement in
equation inference efficiency, being three times more effective than baseline
approaches while maintaining accurate predictions. Furthermore, we apply our
model to uncover more intuitive laws of interaction transmission from global
epidemic outbreak data, achieving optimal data fitting. This model extends the
application boundary of pre-trained symbolic regression models to complex
networks, and we believe it provides a foundational solution for revealing the
hidden mechanisms behind changes in complex phenomena, enhancing
interpretability, and inspiring further scientific discoveries.

### [434] [VietASR: Achieving Industry-level Vietnamese ASR with 50-hour labeled data and Large-Scale Speech Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21527)
*Jianheng Zhuo,Yifan Yang,Yiwen Shao,Yong Xu,Dong Yu,Kai Yu,Xie Chen*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: VietASR是一种新型的自动语音识别（ASR）训练流程，利用大量未标记数据和少量标记数据，通过多轮自监督学习，显著提升低资源语言（如越南语）的ASR性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言（如越南语）ASR系统中训练成本高、延迟大和可访问性差的问题。

Method: 提出VietASR训练流程，结合大规模未标记数据和小规模标记数据，通过多轮自监督学习优化模型。

Result: 在70,000小时未标记数据和50小时标记数据上训练，VietASR性能优于Whisper Large-v3和商用ASR系统。

Conclusion: VietASR为低资源ASR提供了一种高效、实用的解决方案，并将开源代码和模型以促进研究。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has made remarkable progress but heavily
relies on large-scale labeled data, which is scarce for low-resource languages
like Vietnamese. While existing systems such as Whisper, USM, and MMS achieve
promising performance, their efficacy remains inadequate in terms of training
costs, latency, and accessibility. To address these issues, we propose VietASR,
a novel ASR training pipeline that leverages vast amounts of unlabeled data and
a small set of labeled data. Through multi-iteration ASR-biased self-supervised
learning on a large-scale unlabeled dataset, VietASR offers a cost-effective
and practical solution for enhancing ASR performance. Experiments demonstrate
that pre-training on 70,000-hour unlabeled data and fine-tuning on merely
50-hour labeled data yield a lightweight but powerful ASR model. It outperforms
Whisper Large-v3 and commercial ASR systems on real-world data. Our code and
models will be open-sourced to facilitate research in low-resource ASR.

*Emmanuel Akinrintoyo,Nadine Abdelhalim,Nicole Salomons*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Whisper在转录痴呆症患者语音时表现不佳，因其训练数据主要为标准语音。通过微调Whisper模型并使用痴呆症语音数据集，显著提升了转录准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 痴呆症患者的语音特征（如停顿、重复）导致标准语音识别工具表现不佳，但准确转录对诊断和辅助技术开发至关重要。

Method: 使用DementiaBank和内部数据集微调Whisper模型，评估词错误率（WER）、填充词包含率（FIR）和F1分数。

Result: 微调后的模型表现显著优于原模型，中等规模模型的WER降至0.24，且对未见数据具有良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: 微调Whisper模型可有效提升痴呆症语音的转录准确率，为诊断和辅助技术提供支持。

Abstract: Whisper fails to correctly transcribe dementia speech because persons with
dementia (PwDs) often exhibit irregular speech patterns and disfluencies such
as pauses, repetitions, and fragmented sentences. It was trained on standard
speech and may have had little or no exposure to dementia-affected speech.
However, correct transcription is vital for dementia speech for cost-effective
diagnosis and the development of assistive technology. In this work, we
fine-tune Whisper with the open-source dementia speech dataset (DementiaBank)
and our in-house dataset to improve its word error rate (WER). The fine-tuning
also includes filler words to ascertain the filler inclusion rate (FIR) and F1
score. The fine-tuned models significantly outperformed the off-the-shelf
models. The medium-sized model achieved a WER of 0.24, outperforming previous
work. Similarly, there was a notable generalisability to unseen data and speech
patterns.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 研究发现，LibriSpeech和Common Voice评估集中的大量数据出现在LLM预训练语料中，导致LLM性能评估可能不可靠。污染数据会显著影响LLM生成结果，但语音识别错误率差异较小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证LLM在语音任务中的性能提升是否因数据污染而失真，强调使用独立数据评估的重要性。

Method: 比较污染与非污染数据训练的LLM，分析其对测试句子的生成倾向及语音识别性能。

Result: 污染LLM更易生成训练见过的句子，语音识别错误率差异小但概率分配显著偏斜。

Conclusion: 数据污染会微妙影响LLM输出，需用独立数据评估LLM语音系统以避免偏差。

Abstract: Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) can improve
performance of speech tasks compared to existing systems. To support their
claims, results on LibriSpeech and Common Voice are often quoted. However, this
work finds that a substantial amount of the LibriSpeech and Common Voice
evaluation sets appear in public LLM pretraining corpora. This calls into
question the reliability of findings drawn from these two datasets. To measure
the impact of contamination, LLMs trained with or without contamination are
compared, showing that a contaminated LLM is more likely to generate test
sentences it has seen during training. Speech recognisers using contaminated
LLMs shows only subtle differences in error rates, but assigns significantly
higher probabilities to transcriptions seen during training. Results show that
LLM outputs can be biased by tiny amounts of data contamination, highlighting
the importance of evaluating LLM-based speech systems with held-out data.

Conclusion: LLM-Dys为语音不流畅检测提供了高质量数据，并开源了所有资源。

Abstract: Speech dysfluency detection is crucial for clinical diagnosis and language
assessment, but existing methods are limited by the scarcity of high-quality
annotated data. Although recent advances in TTS model have enabled synthetic
dysfluency generation, existing synthetic datasets suffer from unnatural
prosody and limited contextual diversity. To address these limitations, we
propose LLM-Dys -- the most comprehensive dysfluent speech corpus with
LLM-enhanced dysfluency simulation. This dataset captures 11 dysfluency
categories spanning both word and phoneme levels. Building upon this resource,
we improve an end-to-end dysfluency detection framework. Experimental

*Mathew J. Walter,Aaron Barrett,Kimberly Tam*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DFCR的方法，通过多输入和数据融合增强AI系统对抗对抗性攻击的韧性，显著减少了攻击损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性AI攻击对依赖AI的自主交通系统构成威胁，传统防御方法范围有限且缺乏有效的安全指标。

Method: 提出DFCR方法，利用多输入和数据融合构建防御组件，并引入AI安全指标。

Result: DFCR方法显著提升了对抗性攻击的韧性，减少了多种攻击类型的损失。

Conclusion: DFCR方法为开发更安全和韧性的AI系统提供了新途径。

Abstract: Adversarial artificial intelligence (AI) attacks pose a significant threat to
autonomous transportation, such as maritime vessels, that rely on AI
components. Malicious actors can exploit these systems to deceive and
manipulate AI-driven operations. This paper addresses three critical research
challenges associated with adversarial AI: the limited scope of traditional
defences, inadequate security metrics, and the need to build resilience beyond
model-level defences. To address these challenges, we propose building defences
utilising multiple inputs and data fusion to create defensive components and an
AI security metric as a novel approach toward developing more secure AI
systems. We name this approach the Data Fusion Cyber Resilience (DFCR) method,
and we evaluate it through real-world demonstrations and comprehensive
quantitative analyses, comparing a system built with the DFCR method against
single-input models and models utilising existing state-of-the-art defences.
The findings show that the DFCR approach significantly enhances resilience
against adversarial machine learning attacks in maritime autonomous system
operations, achieving up to a 35\% reduction in loss for successful
multi-pronged perturbation attacks, up to a 100\% reduction in loss for
successful adversarial patch attacks and up to 100\% reduction in loss for
successful spoofing attacks when using these more resilient systems. We
demonstrate how DFCR and DFCR confidence scores can reduce adversarial AI
contact confidence and improve decision-making by the system, even when typical
adversarial defences have been compromised. Ultimately, this work contributes
to the development of more secure and resilient AI-driven systems against
adversarial attacks.

Motivation: 随着视频生成模型的快速发展，高度逼真的合成视频引发了与虚假信息和版权侵权相关的伦理问题。视频水印被提出作为一种缓解策略，但其鲁棒性尚未充分研究。

Method: 研究通过生成统一数据集，涵盖三种视频生成模型、三种视频风格、四种水印方法和七种检测聚合策略，评估了12种扰动类型在白盒、黑盒和无盒威胁模型下的表现。

Result: 研究发现当前水印方法在多种攻击下存在显著漏洞，鲁棒性不足。

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发更鲁棒视频水印解决方案的紧迫性，并提供了公开代码以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: The rapid development of video generative models has led to a surge in highly
realistic synthetic videos, raising ethical concerns related to disinformation
and copyright infringement. Recently, video watermarking has been proposed as a
mitigation strategy by embedding invisible marks into AI-generated videos to
enable subsequent detection. However, the robustness of existing video
watermarking methods against both common and adversarial perturbations remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce VideoMarkBench, the first systematic
benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of video watermarks under
watermark removal and watermark forgery attacks. Our study encompasses a
unified dataset generated by three state-of-the-art video generative models,
across three video styles, incorporating four watermarking methods and seven
aggregation strategies used during detection. We comprehensively evaluate 12
types of perturbations under white-box, black-box, and no-box threat models.
Our findings reveal significant vulnerabilities in current watermarking
approaches and highlight the urgent need for more robust solutions. Our code is

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在同行评审中使用大语言模型（LLM）的挑战，并提出了一种基于主题的水印技术（TBW）来检测LLM生成的文本，以维护评审过程的完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在学术工作中的应用增加，同行评审中禁止使用LLM，主要担心其可能泄露机密、生成虚假内容或评价不一致。因此需要一种可靠的机制来识别LLM生成的文本。

Method: 研究评估了一种轻量级、语义感知的水印技术（TBW），通过在多LLM配置（包括基础版、少样本和微调版）上进行测试，并使用真实同行评审数据验证其效果。

Result: 结果显示，TBW在保持评审质量的同时，对基于改写的逃避行为表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TBW是一种低侵入性且实用的解决方案，适用于在同行评审中监管LLM的使用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into academic
workflows, with many conferences and journals permitting their use for tasks
such as language refinement and literature summarization. However, their use in
peer review remains prohibited due to concerns around confidentiality breaches,
hallucinated content, and inconsistent evaluations. As LLM-generated text
becomes more indistinguishable from human writing, there is a growing need for
reliable attribution mechanisms to preserve the integrity of the review
process. In this work, we evaluate topic-based watermarking (TBW), a
lightweight, semantic-aware technique designed to embed detectable signals into
LLM-generated text. We conduct a comprehensive assessment across multiple LLM
configurations, including base, few-shot, and fine-tuned variants, using
authentic peer review data from academic conferences. Our results show that TBW
maintains review quality relative to non-watermarked outputs, while
demonstrating strong robustness to paraphrasing-based evasion. These findings
highlight the viability of TBW as a minimally intrusive and practical solution
for enforcing LLM usage in peer review.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车联网系统的高度互联性带来了严重的安全漏洞，传统安全机制难以应对复杂的网络攻击，因此需要开发新的检测方法。

Method: 使用无监督自编码器，结合加权重建和三元组损失训练模型，完全基于良性网络数据训练，以检测未知攻击。

Result: 模型在良性数据上准确率约99%，在异常数据上表现97%-100%，并通过迁移学习展示了跨领域适应性。

Conclusion: 该方法在车联网安全中表现优异，具有高准确性和跨领域适应性，为复杂网络攻击检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Internet of Vehicles (IoV) systems, while offering significant advancements
in transportation efficiency and safety, introduce substantial security
vulnerabilities due to their highly interconnected nature. These dynamic
systems produce massive amounts of data between vehicles, infrastructure, and
cloud services and present a highly distributed framework with a wide attack
surface. In considering network-centered attacks on IoV systems, attacks such
as Denial-of-Service (DoS) can prohibit the communication of essential physical
traffic safety information between system elements, illustrating that the
security concerns for these systems go beyond the traditional confidentiality,
integrity, and availability concerns of enterprise systems. Given the
complexity and volume of data generated by IoV systems, traditional security
mechanisms are often inadequate for accurately detecting sophisticated and
evolving cyberattacks. Here, we present an unsupervised autoencoder method
trained entirely on benign network data for the purpose of unseen attack
detection in IoV networks. We leverage a weighted combination of reconstruction
and triplet margin loss to guide the autoencoder training and develop a diverse
representation of the benign training set. We conduct extensive experiments on
recent network intrusion datasets from two different application domains,
industrial IoT and home IoT, that represent the modern IoV task. We show that
our method performs robustly for all unseen attack types, with roughly 99%
accuracy on benign data and between 97% and 100% performance on anomaly data.
We extend these results to show that our model is adaptable through the use of
transfer learning, achieving similarly high results while leveraging domain
features from one domain to another.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TIM的通用防御框架，用于自适应地抵御多种越狱攻击，通过训练检测令牌和安全微调实现自我进化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法针对特定类型的越狱攻击，难以应对多样化的对抗策略，因此需要一种通用且自适应的防御方案。

Method: TIM框架通过训练检测令牌识别越狱行为，并在检测到攻击时进行安全微调，同时解耦检测模块与微调过程以避免性能下降。

Result: 实验表明，TIM在单模态和多模态大语言模型上均能有效抵御越狱攻击。

Conclusion: TIM是一种通用且自适应的防御框架，能够有效应对多样化的越狱攻击策略。

Abstract: While (multimodal) large language models (LLMs) have attracted widespread
attention due to their exceptional capabilities, they remain vulnerable to
jailbreak attacks. Various defense methods are proposed to defend against
jailbreak attacks, however, they are often tailored to specific types of
jailbreak attacks, limiting their effectiveness against diverse adversarial
strategies. For instance, rephrasing-based defenses are effective against text
adversarial jailbreaks but fail to counteract image-based attacks. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a universal defense framework, termed Test-time
IMmunization (TIM), which can adaptively defend against various jailbreak
attacks in a self-evolving way. Specifically, TIM initially trains a gist token
for efficient detection, which it subsequently applies to detect jailbreak
activities during inference. When jailbreak attempts are identified, TIM
implements safety fine-tuning using the detected jailbreak instructions paired
with refusal answers. Furthermore, to mitigate potential performance
degradation in the detector caused by parameter updates during safety
fine-tuning, we decouple the fine-tuning process from the detection module.
Extensive experiments on both LLMs and multimodal LLMs demonstrate the efficacy
of TIM.

Motivation: ICS蜜罐难以模拟真实物理过程，易被攻击者识破，需改进模拟逼真度。

Method: 使用随机森林等模型，基于时间序列数据评估模拟噪声分布，无需复杂数学模型。

Result: 在真实电网数据测试中，模型召回率达1.0，确定高斯和高斯混合分布最适合模拟。

Conclusion: SimProcess能有效提升蜜罐逼真度，适用于复杂动态系统，代码已开源。

Abstract: Industrial Control Systems (ICS) manage critical infrastructures like power
grids and water treatment plants. Cyberattacks on ICSs can disrupt operations,
causing severe economic, environmental, and safety issues. For example,
undetected pollution in a water plant can put the lives of thousands at stake.
ICS researchers have increasingly turned to honeypots -- decoy systems designed
to attract attackers, study their behaviors, and eventually improve defensive
mechanisms. However, existing ICS honeypots struggle to replicate the ICS
physical process, making them susceptible to detection. Accurately simulating
the noise in ICS physical processes is challenging because different factors
produce it, including sensor imperfections and external interferences.
  In this paper, we propose SimProcess, a novel framework to rank the fidelity
of ICS simulations by evaluating how closely they resemble real-world and noisy
physical processes. It measures the simulation distance from a target system by
estimating the noise distribution with machine learning models like Random
Forest. Unlike existing solutions that require detailed mathematical models or
are limited to simple systems, SimProcess operates with only a timeseries of
measurements from the real system, making it applicable to a broader range of
complex dynamic systems. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through a
case study using real-world power grid data from the EPIC testbed. We compare
the performance of various simulation methods, including static and generative
noise techniques. Our model correctly classifies real samples with a recall of
up to 1.0. It also identifies Gaussian and Gaussian Mixture as the best
distribution to simulate our power systems, together with a generative solution
provided by an autoencoder, thereby helping developers to improve honeypot
fidelity. Additionally, we make our code publicly available.

Motivation: 传统手术决策依赖经验，存在变异性。数据驱动的系统可优化决策，减少术后并发症。

Method: 使用深度Q网络强化学习模型，分析50,021例手术数据，训练和测试模型。

Result: 模型69%匹配医生决策，推荐剂量与医生不同时，AKI发生率最低。

Conclusion: 模型政策有望减少术后AKI，改善手术结果。

Abstract: Traditional methods of surgical decision making heavily rely on human
experience and prompt actions, which are variable. A data-driven system
generating treatment recommendations based on patient states can be a
substantial asset in perioperative decision-making, as in cases of
intraoperative hypotension, for which suboptimal management is associated with
acute kidney injury (AKI), a common and morbid postoperative complication. We
developed a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model to recommend optimum dose of
intravenous (IV) fluid and vasopressors during surgery to avoid intraoperative
hypotension and postoperative AKI. We retrospectively analyzed 50,021 surgeries
from 42,547 adult patients who underwent major surgery at a quaternary care
hospital between June 2014 and September 2020. Of these, 34,186 surgeries were
used for model training and 15,835 surgeries were reserved for testing. We
developed a Deep Q-Networks based RL model using 16 variables including
intraoperative physiologic time series, total dose of IV fluid and vasopressors
extracted for every 15-minute epoch. The model replicated 69% of physician's
decisions for the dosage of vasopressors and proposed higher or lower dosage of
vasopressors than received in 10% and 21% of the treatments, respectively. In
terms of IV fluids, the model's recommendations were within 0.05 ml/kg/15 min
of the actual dose in 41% of the cases, with higher or lower doses recommended
for 27% and 32% of the treatments, respectively. The model resulted in a higher
estimated policy value compared to the physicians' actual treatments, as well
as random and zero-drug policies. AKI prevalence was the lowest in patients
receiving medication dosages that aligned with model's decisions. Our findings
suggest that implementation of the model's policy has the potential to reduce
postoperative AKI and improve other outcomes driven by intraoperative
hypotension.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多智能体系统的HPA框架，通过分解目标为子任务并协同处理，提升Kubernetes集群在对抗性场景下的操作韧性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HPA方法难以应对动态对抗性场景（如DDoS），而现有强化学习方法仅优化单一目标，忽略广泛故障场景。

Method: 提出四阶段在线框架：1) 构建数字孪生模型；2) 训练针对故障场景的智能体；3) 分析行为可解释性；4) 将策略迁移至实际集群。

Result: 实验表明，该HPA MAS在复杂对抗条件下优于三种现有HPA系统。

Conclusion: 通过多智能体协同分解任务，显著提升了集群的操作韧性。

Abstract: In cloud-native systems, Kubernetes clusters with interdependent services
often face challenges to their operational resilience due to poor workload
management issues such as resource blocking, bottlenecks, or continuous pod
crashes. These vulnerabilities are further amplified in adversarial scenarios,
such as Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks (DDoS). Conventional Horizontal
Pod Autoscaling (HPA) approaches struggle to address such dynamic conditions,
while reinforcement learning-based methods, though more adaptable, typically
optimize single goals like latency or resource usage, neglecting broader
failure scenarios. We propose decomposing the overarching goal of maintaining
operational resilience into failure-specific sub-goals delegated to
collaborative agents, collectively forming an HPA Multi-Agent System (MAS). We
introduce an automated, four-phase online framework for HPA MAS design: 1)
modeling a digital twin built from cluster traces; 2) training agents in
simulation using roles and missions tailored to failure contexts; 3) analyzing
agent behaviors for explainability; and 4) transferring learned policies to the
real cluster. Experimental results demonstrate that the generated HPA MASs
outperform three state-of-the-art HPA systems in sustaining operational
resilience under various adversarial conditions in a proposed complex cluster.

Conclusion: 研究为LLM多智能体系统的社会动态提供了新见解，并为设计更有效的协作框架开辟了途径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the
emergence of multi-agent systems where LLMs interact, collaborate, and make
decisions in shared environments. While individual model behavior has been
extensively studied, the dynamics of peer influence in such systems remain
underexplored. In this paper, we investigate herd behavior, the tendency of
agents to align their outputs with those of their peers, within LLM-based
multi-agent interactions. We present a series of controlled experiments that
reveal how herd behaviors are shaped by multiple factors. First, we show that
the gap between self-confidence and perceived confidence in peers significantly
impacts an agent's likelihood to conform. Second, we find that the format in
which peer information is presented plays a critical role in modulating the
strength of herd behavior. Finally, we demonstrate that the degree of herd
behavior can be systematically controlled, and that appropriately calibrated
herd tendencies can enhance collaborative outcomes. These findings offer new
insights into the social dynamics of LLM-based systems and open pathways for

Abstract: This study presents an innovative approach to urban mobility simulation by
integrating a Large Language Model (LLM) with Agent-Based Modeling (ABM).
Unlike traditional rule-based ABM, the proposed framework leverages LLM to
enhance agent diversity and realism by generating synthetic population
profiles, allocating routine and occasional locations, and simulating
personalized routes. Using real-world data, the simulation models individual
behaviors and large-scale mobility patterns in Taipei City. Key insights, such
as route heat maps and mode-specific indicators, provide urban planners with
actionable information for policy-making. Future work focuses on establishing
robust validation frameworks to ensure accuracy and reliability in urban
planning applications.

TL;DR: MARL-CPC框架通过集体预测编码（CPC）实现去中心化多智能体强化学习中的有效通信，支持非合作环境，性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在部分可观测的多智能体强化学习中，传统方法假设合作且通信直接关联动作空间，限制了非合作场景的应用。MARL-CPC旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出MARL-CPC框架，结合集体预测编码（CPC）模型，开发Bandit-CPC和IPPO-CPC算法，用于非合作任务。

Result: 实验表明，MARL-CPC在非合作任务中优于传统方法，即使通信对发送者无直接收益也能实现有效协调。

Conclusion: MARL-CPC为复杂去中心化环境中的智能体协调提供了新思路，扩展了多智能体通信的应用场景。

Abstract: In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), effective communication
improves agent performance, particularly under partial observability. We
propose MARL-CPC, a framework that enables communication among fully
decentralized, independent agents without parameter sharing. MARL-CPC
incorporates a message learning model based on collective predictive coding
(CPC) from emergent communication research. Unlike conventional methods that
treat messages as part of the action space and assume cooperation, MARL-CPC
links messages to state inference, supporting communication in non-cooperative,
reward-independent settings. We introduce two algorithms -Bandit-CPC and
IPPO-CPC- and evaluate them in non-cooperative MARL tasks. Benchmarks show that
both outperform standard message-as-action approaches, establishing effective
communication even when messages offer no direct benefit to the sender. These
results highlight MARL-CPC's potential for enabling coordination in complex,
decentralized environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于生成AI代理的心理丰富框架，用于情感模拟，显著提升了情感分析的预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统情感分析依赖表面语言模式和回顾性数据，无法捕捉心理和上下文驱动因素，限制了其在预测性应用中的效果。

Method: 使用具有心理特征的生成AI代理，通过三个阶段（代理实例化、场景暴露、情感生成）进行情感模拟。

Result: 上下文编码实现了92%的原始调查响应对齐，情感模拟任务中达到81%-86%的准确率，显著优于分类编码。

Conclusion: 该框架为基于心理的情感建模提供了可扩展方案，标志着情感分析从回顾性分类向动态模拟的转变。

Abstract: Traditional sentiment analysis relies on surface-level linguistic patterns
and retrospective data, limiting its ability to capture the psychological and
contextual drivers of human sentiment. These limitations constrain its
effectiveness in applications that require predictive insight, such as policy
testing, narrative framing, and behavioral forecasting. We present a robust
framework for sentiment simulation using generative AI agents embedded with
psychologically rich profiles. Agents are instantiated from a nationally
representative survey of 2,485 Filipino respondents, combining sociodemographic
information with validated constructs of personality traits, values, beliefs,
and socio-political attitudes. The framework includes three stages: (1) agent
embodiment via categorical or contextualized encodings, (2) exposure to
real-world political and economic scenarios, and (3) generation of sentiment
ratings accompanied by explanatory rationales. Using Quadratic Weighted
Accuracy (QWA), we evaluated alignment between agent-generated and human
responses. Contextualized encoding achieved 92% alignment in replicating
original survey responses. In sentiment simulation tasks, agents reached
81%--86% accuracy against ground truth sentiment, with contextualized profile
encodings significantly outperforming categorical (p < 0.0001, Cohen's d =
0.70). Simulation results remained consistent across repeated trials
(+/-0.2--0.5% SD) and resilient to variation in scenario framing (p = 0.9676,
Cohen's d = 0.02). Our findings establish a scalable framework for sentiment
modeling through psychographically grounded AI agents. This work signals a
paradigm shift in sentiment analysis from retrospective classification to
prospective and dynamic simulation grounded in psychology of sentiment
formation.

Result: 框架为多智能体系统的协作性能与效率提供了新思路，并指出了潜在研究方向。

Conclusion: 该视角和框架为智能体AI时代提供了关键新见解，有望推动复杂实际应用的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) have emerged as a
powerful paradigm for tackling complex tasks through collaborative
intelligence. Nevertheless, the question of how agents should be structurally
organized for optimal cooperation remains largely unexplored. In this position
paper, we aim to gently redirect the focus of the MAS research community toward
this critical dimension: develop topology-aware MASs for specific tasks.
Specifically, the system consists of three core components - agents,
communication links, and communication patterns - that collectively shape its
coordination performance and efficiency. To this end, we introduce a
systematic, three-stage framework: agent selection, structure profiling, and
topology synthesis. Each stage would trigger new research opportunities in
areas such as language models, reinforcement learning, graph learning, and
generative modeling; together, they could unleash the full potential of MASs in
complicated real-world applications. Then, we discuss the potential challenges
and opportunities in the evaluation of multiple systems. We hope our
perspective and framework can offer critical new insights in the era of agentic
AI.

TL;DR: iDSE是一个基于LLM的HLS设计空间探索框架，通过智能剪枝和多路径优化显著提升设计效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HLS设计空间探索方法成本高且效果不佳，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 利用LLM的感知能力智能剪枝设计空间，结合多路径优化加速收敛到Pareto前沿。

Result: iDSE在接近Pareto前沿方面比启发式方法快5.1~16.6倍，仅需4.6%的设计探索即可匹配NSGA-II。

Conclusion: iDSE展示了LLM在HLS优化中的潜力，为多目标优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: High-Level Synthesis (HLS) serves as an agile hardware development tool that
streamlines the circuit design by abstracting the register transfer level into
behavioral descriptions, while allowing designers to customize the generated
microarchitectures through optimization directives. However, the combinatorial
explosion of possible directive configurations yields an intractable design
space. Traditional design space exploration (DSE) methods, despite adopting
heuristics or constructing predictive models to accelerate Pareto-optimal
design acquisition, still suffer from prohibitive exploration costs and
suboptimal results. Addressing these concerns, we introduce iDSE, the first
LLM-aided DSE framework that leverages HLS design quality perception to
effectively navigate the design space. iDSE intelligently pruns the design
space to guide LLMs in calibrating representative initial sampling designs,
expediting convergence toward the Pareto front. By exploiting the convergent
and divergent thinking patterns inherent in LLMs for hardware optimization,
iDSE achieves multi-path refinement of the design quality and diversity.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that iDSE outperforms heuristic-based DSE
methods by 5.1$\times$$\sim$16.6$\times$ in proximity to the reference Pareto
front, matching NSGA-II with only 4.6% of the explored designs. Our work
demonstrates the transformative potential of LLMs in scalable and efficient HLS
design optimization, offering new insights into multiobjective optimization
challenges.

TL;DR: Align-DA提出了一种基于生成过程的数据同化方法，通过奖励信号引导背景先验，替代传统手动调整方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据同化方法依赖经验性简化背景先验，需持续调整，而Align-DA通过数据驱动对齐解决这一问题。

Method: Align-DA在潜在空间中训练基于分数的模型，利用三种奖励信号（同化精度、预报技能和物理一致性）对齐背景先验。

Result: 实验表明，Align-DA在不同评估指标和观测策略下均能提升分析质量。

Conclusion: 偏好对齐作为软约束，能自动适应复杂背景先验，为数据同化领域提供了新方向。

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) aims to estimate the full state of a dynamical system
by combining partial and noisy observations with a prior model forecast,
commonly referred to as the background. In atmospheric applications, this
problem is fundamentally ill-posed due to the sparsity of observations relative
to the high-dimensional state space. Traditional methods address this challenge
by simplifying background priors to regularize the solution, which are
empirical and require continual tuning for application. Inspired by alignment
techniques in text-to-image diffusion models, we propose Align-DA, which
formulates DA as a generative process and uses reward signals to guide
background priors, replacing manual tuning with data-driven alignment.
Specifically, we train a score-based model in the latent space to approximate
the background-conditioned prior, and align it using three complementary reward
signals for DA: (1) assimilation accuracy, (2) forecast skill initialized from
the assimilated state, and (3) physical adherence of the analysis fields.
Experiments with multiple reward signals demonstrate consistent improvements in
analysis quality across different evaluation metrics and observation-guidance
strategies. These results show that preference alignment, implemented as a soft
constraint, can automatically adapt complex background priors tailored to DA,
offering a promising new direction for advancing the field.

Result: 在AudioCaps基准测试中表现优于现有基线，推理速度提升约6倍。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升模型在不对齐场景下的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Current vision-guided audio captioning systems frequently fail to address
audiovisual misalignment in real-world scenarios, such as dubbed content or
off-screen sounds. To bridge this critical gap, we present an entropy-aware
gated fusion framework that dynamically modulates visual information flow
through cross-modal uncertainty quantification. Our novel approach employs
attention entropy analysis in cross-attention layers to automatically identify
and suppress misleading visual cues during modal fusion. Complementing this
architecture, we develop a batch-wise audiovisual shuffling technique that
generates synthetic mismatched training pairs, greatly enhancing model
resilience against alignment noise. Evaluations on the AudioCaps benchmark
demonstrate our system's superior performance over existing baselines,
especially in mismatched modality scenarios. Furthermore, our solution
demonstrates an approximately 6x improvement in inference speed compared to the
baseline.

Conclusion: 该研究消除了衍射光学和可微分光学设计在实际应用中的制造限制。

Abstract: Differentiable optics, as an emerging paradigm that jointly optimizes optics
and (optional) image processing algorithms, has made innovative optical designs
possible across a broad range of applications. Many of these systems utilize
diffractive optical components (DOEs) for holography, PSF engineering, or
wavefront shaping. Existing approaches have, however, mostly remained limited
to laboratory prototypes, owing to a large quality gap between simulation and
manufactured devices. We aim at lifting the fundamental technical barriers to
the practical use of learned diffractive optical systems. To this end, we
propose a fabrication-aware design pipeline for diffractive optics fabricated
by direct-write grayscale lithography followed by nano-imprinting replication,
which is directly suited for inexpensive mass production of large area designs.
We propose a super-resolved neural lithography model that can accurately
predict the 3D geometry generated by the fabrication process. This model can be
seamlessly integrated into existing differentiable optics frameworks, enabling
fabrication-aware, end-to-end optimization of computational optical systems. To
tackle the computational challenges, we also devise tensor-parallel compute
framework centered on distributing large-scale FFT computation across many
GPUs. As such, we demonstrate large scale diffractive optics designs up to
32.16 mm $\times$ 21.44 mm, simulated on grids of up to 128,640 by 85,760
feature points. We find adequate agreement between simulation and fabricated
prototypes for applications such as holography and PSF engineering. We also
achieve high image quality from an imaging system comprised only of a single
DOE, with images processed only by a Wiener filter utilizing the simulation
PSF. We believe our findings lift the fabrication limitations for real-world
applications of diffractive optics and differentiable optical design.

Motivation: 解决二阶非线性不确定系统在未知外系统下的鲁棒输出调节问题，避免传统自适应控制方法中的爆发现象。

Method: 构造通用内模，引入坐标变换将问题转化为增广系统的非自适应稳定化问题，设计稳定控制律并构造严格Lyapunov函数。

Result: 提出的非自适应控制律能使增广系统的输出零化流形具有吸引力，解决了鲁棒输出调节问题。

Conclusion: 通过Duffing系统的控制应用验证了所提方法的有效性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the robust output regulation problem of second-order
nonlinear uncertain systems with an unknown exosystem. Instead of the adaptive
control approach, this paper resorts to a robust control methodology to solve
the problem and thus avoid the bursting phenomenon. In particular, this paper
constructs generic internal models for the steady-state state and input
variables of the system. By introducing a coordinate transformation, this paper
converts the robust output regulation problem into a nonadaptive stabilization
problem of an augmented system composed of the second-order nonlinear uncertain
system and the generic internal models. Then, we design the stabilization
control law and construct a strict Lyapunov function that guarantees the
robustness with respect to unmodeled disturbances. The analysis shows that the
output zeroing manifold of the augmented system can be made attractive by the
proposed nonadaptive control law, which solves the robust output regulation
problem. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed nonadaptive
internal model approach by its application to the control of the Duffing
system.

Motivation: 传统方法在解决无限时域最优控制问题时可能面临多解问题，且需要先验知识或迭代策略评估，PINNs提供了一种更灵活且高效的替代方案。

Method: 通过将PINNs应用于有限时域变体的稳态HJB方程，确保唯一解，并验证时域长度是否足够，提供扩展方法以减少计算和误差。

Conclusion: 提出的PINNs框架为无限时域最优控制问题提供了一种高效且稳健的解决方案，解决了多解问题并减少了计算负担。

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) framework to solve the
infinite-horizon optimal control problem of nonlinear systems. In particular,
since PINNs are generally able to solve a class of partial differential
equations (PDEs), they can be employed to learn the value function of the
infinite-horizon optimal control problem via solving the associated
steady-state Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. However, an issue here is
that the steady-state HJB equation generally yields multiple solutions; hence
if PINNs are directly employed to it, they may end up approximating a solution
that is different from the optimal value function of the problem. We tackle
this by instead applying PINNs to a finite-horizon variant of the steady-state
HJB that has a unique solution, and which uniformly approximates the optimal
value function as the horizon increases. An algorithm to verify if the chosen
horizon is large enough is also given, as well as a method to extend it -- with
reduced computations and robustness to approximation errors -- in case it is
not. Unlike many existing methods, the proposed technique works well with
non-polynomial basis functions, does not require prior knowledge of a
stabilizing controller, and does not perform iterative policy evaluations.
Simulations are performed, which verify and clarify theoretical findings.

Conclusion: CSI-Bench为健康和以人为中心的应用提供了可扩展、隐私保护的WiFi感知系统基础。

Abstract: WiFi sensing has emerged as a compelling contactless modality for human
activity monitoring by capturing fine-grained variations in Channel State
Information (CSI). Its ability to operate continuously and non-intrusively
while preserving user privacy makes it particularly suitable for health
monitoring. However, existing WiFi sensing systems struggle to generalize in
real-world settings, largely due to datasets collected in controlled

that fail to reflect continuous daily activity.
  We present CSI-Bench, a large-scale, in-the-wild benchmark dataset collected

35 real users. Spanning over 461 hours of effective data, CSI-Bench captures
realistic signal variability under natural conditions. It includes
task-specific datasets for fall detection, breathing monitoring, localization,

joint annotations for user identity, activity, and proximity. To support the

Abstract: Low-altitude economy (LAE) represents an emerging economic paradigm that
redefines commercial and social aerial activities. Large artificial
intelligence models (LAIMs) offer transformative potential to further enhance
the intelligence of LAE services. However, deploying LAIMs in LAE poses several
challenges, including the significant gap between their computational/storage
demands and the limited onboard resources of LAE entities, the mismatch between
lab-trained LAIMs and dynamic physical environments, and the inefficiencies of
traditional decoupled designs for sensing, communication, and computation. To
address these issues, we first propose a hierarchical system architecture
tailored for LAIM deployment and present representative LAE application
scenarios. Next, we explore key enabling techniques that facilitate the mutual
co-evolution of LAIMs and low-altitude systems, and introduce a task-oriented
execution pipeline for scalable and adaptive service delivery. Then, the
proposed framework is validated through real-world case studies. Finally, we
outline open challenges to inspire future research.

Motivation: 传统低阶有限元方法在Lamé系数λ趋近于无穷大（或泊松比ν趋近于1/2）时精度下降，即锁定问题，尚未完全解决。

Method: 利用PINN，通过适当分解方程以缓解系数极端不平衡，同时求解正向和逆向问题，恢复分解系统的解及相关外部条件。

Result: 通过多种数值实验（包括常数、变量和参数化Lamé系数）验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为解决近不可压缩材料的锁定问题提供了一种高效且鲁棒的途径。

Abstract: Due to divergence instability, the accuracy of low-order conforming finite
element methods for nearly incompressible homogeneous elasticity equations
deteriorates as the Lam\'e coefficient $\lambda\to\infty$, or equivalently as
the Poisson ratio $\nu\to1/2$. This phenomenon, known as locking or
non-robustness, remains not fully understood despite extensive investigation.
In this paper, we propose a robust method based on a fundamentally different,
machine-learning-driven approach. Leveraging recently developed
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), we address the numerical solution of
linear elasticity equations governing nearly incompressible materials. The core
idea of our method is to appropriately decompose the given equations to
alleviate the extreme imbalance in the coefficients, while simultaneously
solving both the forward and inverse problems to recover the solutions of the
decomposed systems as well as the associated external conditions. Through
various numerical experiments, including constant, variable and parametric
Lam\'e coefficients, we illustrate the efficiency of the proposed methodology.

traditional methods that primarily rely on static graph structures, HiT
leverages a dynamic framework that accounts for both direct and indirect
interactions among traffic participants. This allows the model to capture the
subtle yet significant influences of surrounding vehicles, enabling more
accurate and human-like predictions. To evaluate HiT's performance, we
conducted extensive experiments using diverse and challenging real-world
datasets, including NGSIM, HighD, RounD, ApolloScape, and MoCAD++. The results
demonstrate that HiT consistently outperforms other top models across multiple
metrics, particularly excelling in scenarios involving aggressive driving
behaviors. This research presents a significant step forward in trajectory
prediction, offering a more reliable and interpretable approach for enhancing
the safety and efficiency of fully autonomous driving systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种边缘-云协作的解码框架，通过小型设备模型和大型服务器模型的协同工作，显著降低了延迟并提升了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决边缘设备部署大型语言模型（LLMs）时资源受限的问题，同时减少对昂贵云API的依赖，降低成本并提升隐私性。

Method: 采用边缘设备上的小型草稿模型和服务器上的大型目标模型，通过早期退出机制和预生成令牌技术，优化并行计算。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比传统云解码降低了35%的延迟，预生成令牌技术额外提升了11%的效率，并在机器人控制中实现了21%的速度提升。

Conclusion: 该框架为资源受限的边缘设备提供了高效的LLM和VLM应用解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable various applications on edge devices such
as smartphones, wearables, and embodied robots. However, their deployment often
depends on expensive cloud-based APIs, creating high operational costs, which
limit access for smaller organizations and raise sustainability concerns.
Certain LLMs can be deployed on-device, offering a cost-effective solution with
reduced latency and improved privacy. Yet, limited computing resources
constrain the size and accuracy of models that can be deployed, necessitating a
collaborative design between edge and cloud. We propose a fast and
cost-effective speculative edge-cloud decoding framework with a large target
model on the server and a small draft model on the device. By introducing early
exits in the target model, tokens are generated mid-verification, allowing the
client to preemptively draft subsequent tokens before final verification, thus
utilizing idle time and enhancing parallelism between edge and cloud. Using an
NVIDIA Jetson Nano (client) and an A100 GPU (server) with Vicuna-68M (draft)
and Llama2-7B (target) models, our method achieves up to a 35% reduction in
latency compared to cloud-based autoregressive decoding, with an additional 11%
improvement from preemptive drafting. To demonstrate real-world applicability,
we deploy our method on the Unitree Go2 quadruped robot using Vision-Language
Model (VLM) based control, achieving a 21% speedup over traditional cloud-based
autoregressive decoding. These results demonstrate the potential of our
framework for real-time LLM and VLM applications on resource-constrained edge
devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏细粒度操作任务的部分级指令和多样化的3D对象标注，限制了机器人操作模型的性能。

Method: 提出PartInstruct数据集，包含对象实例、任务类别和专家演示，并设计了测试套件评估模型泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明，现有模型在部分概念理解和3D空间动作预测上表现不佳，长时任务中尤为困难。

Conclusion: PartInstruct为细粒度机器人操作提供了重要基准，揭示了当前模型的局限性，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Fine-grained robot manipulation, such as lifting and rotating a bottle to
display the label on the cap, requires robust reasoning about object parts and
their relationships with intended tasks. Despite recent advances in training
general-purpose robot manipulation policies guided by language instructions,
there is a notable lack of large-scale datasets for fine-grained manipulation
tasks with part-level instructions and diverse 3D object instances annotated
with part-level labels. In this work, we introduce PartInstruct, the first
large-scale benchmark for training and evaluating fine-grained robot
manipulation models using part-level instructions. PartInstruct comprises 513
object instances across 14 categories, each annotated with part-level
information, and 1302 fine-grained manipulation tasks organized into 16 task
classes. Our training set consists of over 10,000 expert demonstrations
synthesized in a 3D simulator, where each demonstration is paired with a
high-level task instruction, a chain of base part-based skill instructions, and
ground-truth 3D information about the object and its parts. Additionally, we
designed a comprehensive test suite to evaluate the generalizability of learned
policies across new states, objects, and tasks. We evaluated several
state-of-the-art robot manipulation approaches, including end-to-end
vision-language policy learning and bi-level planning models for robot
manipulation on our benchmark. The experimental results reveal that current
models struggle to robustly ground part concepts and predict actions in 3D
space, and face challenges when manipulating object parts in long-horizon
tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种简化扩散/流匹配策略的方法，通过将动作轨迹视为流轨迹，实现实时动作流传输，提升机器人控制的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散/流匹配策略计算成本高，需等待完整采样后才能执行动作，限制了实时性。

Method: 将动作轨迹视为流轨迹，从窄高斯分布采样，逐步积分学习的速度场生成动作序列，支持实时流传输。

Result: 新方法在保持多模态行为建模能力的同时，提升了策略执行速度和传感器-运动回路的紧密性。

Conclusion: 流传输策略在性能上优于现有方法，适用于基于学习的机器人控制。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion$/$flow-matching policies have enabled imitation
learning of complex, multi-modal action trajectories. However, they are
computationally expensive because they sample a trajectory of trajectories: a
diffusion$/$flow trajectory of action trajectories. They discard intermediate
action trajectories, and must wait for the sampling process to complete before
any actions can be executed on the robot. We simplify diffusion$/$flow policies
by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories. Instead of starting from
pure noise, our algorithm samples from a narrow Gaussian around the last
action. Then, it incrementally integrates a velocity field learned via flow
matching to produce a sequence of actions that constitute a single trajectory.
This enables actions to be streamed to the robot on-the-fly during the flow
sampling process, and is well-suited for receding horizon policy execution.
Despite streaming, our method retains the ability to model multi-modal
behavior. We train flows that stabilize around demonstration trajectories to
reduce distribution shift and improve imitation learning performance. Streaming
flow policy outperforms prior methods while enabling faster policy execution
and tighter sensorimotor loops for learning-based robot control. Project

Conclusion: BLADE框架有效结合语言和演示，显著提升了机器人操作的泛化能力和适应性。

Abstract: We introduce Behavior from Language and Demonstration (BLADE), a framework
for long-horizon robotic manipulation by integrating imitation learning and
model-based planning. BLADE leverages language-annotated demonstrations,
extracts abstract action knowledge from large language models (LLMs), and
constructs a library of structured, high-level action representations. These
representations include preconditions and effects grounded in visual perception
for each high-level action, along with corresponding controllers implemented as
neural network-based policies. BLADE can recover such structured
representations automatically, without manually labeled states or symbolic
definitions. BLADE shows significant capabilities in generalizing to novel
situations, including novel initial states, external state perturbations, and
novel goals. We validate the effectiveness of our approach both in simulation
and on real robots with a diverse set of objects with articulated parts,
partial observability, and geometric constraints.

Motivation: 现有端到端VLA系统在微调时会丢失VLM的关键能力，因此需要一种既能继承VLM知识又能实现可操作推理的通用VLA模型。

Method: 采用混合专家模型和三阶段训练流程，结合数学匹配任务验证模型能力。

Result: 模型展现出卓越的数学推理、OCR和空间推理能力，超越现有模仿学习方法。

Conclusion: ChatVLA-2为开发具有强大推理能力的通用机器人基础模型提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have emerged as the next generation of
models in robotics. However, despite leveraging powerful pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), existing end-to-end VLA systems often lose key
capabilities during fine-tuning as the model adapts to specific robotic tasks.
We argue that a generalizable VLA model should retain and expand upon the VLM's
core competencies: 1) Open-world embodied reasoning - the VLA should inherit
the knowledge from VLM, i.e., recognize anything that the VLM can recognize,
capable of solving math problems, possessing visual-spatial intelligence, 2)
Reasoning following - effectively translating the open-world reasoning into
actionable steps for the robot. In this work, we introduce ChatVLA-2, a novel
mixture-of-expert VLA model coupled with a specialized three-stage training
pipeline designed to preserve the VLM's original strengths while enabling
actionable reasoning. To validate our approach, we design a math-matching task
wherein a robot interprets math problems written on a whiteboard and picks
corresponding number cards from a table to solve equations. Remarkably, our
method exhibits exceptional mathematical reasoning and OCR capabilities,
despite these abilities not being explicitly trained within the VLA.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the VLA possesses strong spatial reasoning
skills, enabling it to interpret novel directional instructions involving
previously unseen objects. Overall, our method showcases reasoning and
comprehension abilities that significantly surpass state-of-the-art imitation
learning methods such as OpenVLA, DexVLA, and pi-zero. This work represents a
substantial advancement toward developing truly generalizable robotic
foundation models endowed with robust reasoning capacities.

Motivation: 家庭服务机器人在陌生环境中的自适应导航仍面临挑战，现有VLM方法存在时空不连续性和任务理解不足的局限性。

Method: DORAEMON框架包含Ventral和Dorsal Streams，分别处理时空连续性和决策优化，并引入Nav-Ensurance确保导航安全。

Result: 在HM3D、MP3D和GOAT数据集上，DORAEMON在SR和SPL指标上均优于现有方法，并提出了新评估指标AORI。

Conclusion: DORAEMON在零样本自主导航中表现出色，无需预训练或先验地图构建。

Abstract: Adaptive navigation in unfamiliar environments is crucial for household
service robots but remains challenging due to the need for both low-level path
planning and high-level scene understanding. While recent vision-language model
(VLM) based zero-shot approaches reduce dependence on prior maps and
scene-specific training data, they face significant limitations: spatiotemporal
discontinuity from discrete observations, unstructured memory representations,
and insufficient task understanding leading to navigation failures. We propose
DORAEMON (Decentralized Ontology-aware Reliable Agent with Enhanced Memory
Oriented Navigation), a novel cognitive-inspired framework consisting of
Ventral and Dorsal Streams that mimics human navigation capabilities. The
Dorsal Stream implements the Hierarchical Semantic-Spatial Fusion and Topology
Map to handle spatiotemporal discontinuities, while the Ventral Stream combines
RAG-VLM and Policy-VLM to improve decision-making. Our approach also develops
Nav-Ensurance to ensure navigation safety and efficiency. We evaluate DORAEMON
on the HM3D, MP3D, and GOAT datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both success rate (SR) and success weighted by path length (SPL)
metrics, significantly outperforming existing methods. We also introduce a new
evaluation metric (AORI) to assess navigation intelligence better.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate DORAEMON's effectiveness in zero-shot
autonomous navigation without requiring prior map building or pre-training.

Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶方法与人类认知原则在感知和规划上存在根本性不一致，CogAD旨在通过模仿人类认知机制解决这一问题。

Method: CogAD采用双重层次机制：全局到局部上下文处理（感知）和意图条件多模式轨迹生成（规划），并结合双层次不确定性建模。

Result: 在nuScenes和Bench2Drive数据集上，CogAD在端到端规划中表现最优，尤其在长尾场景和复杂现实驾驶条件下具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CogAD通过模仿人类认知机制，显著提升了自动驾驶系统的感知和规划能力，尤其在复杂场景中表现突出。

Abstract: While end-to-end autonomous driving has advanced significantly, prevailing
methods remain fundamentally misaligned with human cognitive principles in both
perception and planning. In this paper, we propose CogAD, a novel end-to-end
autonomous driving model that emulates the hierarchical cognition mechanisms of
human drivers. CogAD implements dual hierarchical mechanisms: global-to-local
context processing for human-like perception and intent-conditioned multi-mode
trajectory generation for cognitively-inspired planning. The proposed method
demonstrates three principal advantages: comprehensive environmental
understanding through hierarchical perception, robust planning exploration
enabled by multi-level planning, and diverse yet reasonable multi-modal
trajectory generation facilitated by dual-level uncertainty modeling. Extensive
experiments on nuScenes and Bench2Drive demonstrate that CogAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance in end-to-end planning, exhibiting particular
superiority in long-tail scenarios and robust generalization to complex
real-world driving conditions.

Conclusion: MIND-Stack展示了模块化设计的潜力，未来可进一步整合更多模块以提升稳定性和性能。

Abstract: Developing robust, efficient navigation algorithms is challenging. Rule-based
methods offer interpretability and modularity but struggle with learning from
large datasets, while end-to-end neural networks excel in learning but lack
transparency and modularity. In this paper, we present MIND-Stack, a modular
software stack consisting of a localization network and a Stanley Controller
with intermediate human interpretable state representations and end-to-end
differentiability. Our approach enables the upstream localization module to
reduce the downstream control error, extending its role beyond state
estimation. Unlike existing research on differentiable algorithms that either
lack modules of the autonomous stack to span from sensor input to actuator
output or real-world implementation, MIND-Stack offers both capabilities. We
conduct experiments that demonstrate the ability of the localization module to
reduce the downstream control loss through its end-to-end differentiability
while offering better performance than state-of-the-art algorithms. We showcase
sim-to-real capabilities by deploying the algorithm on a real-world embedded
autonomous platform with limited computation power and demonstrate simultaneous
training of both the localization and controller towards one goal. While
MIND-Stack shows good results, we discuss the incorporation of additional
modules from the autonomous navigation pipeline in the future, promising even
greater stability and performance in the next iterations of the framework.

Conclusion: ForceVLA强调了多模态整合对灵巧操作的重要性，并为物理智能机器人控制设定了新基准。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced general-purpose robotic
manipulation by leveraging pretrained visual and linguistic representations.
However, they struggle with contact-rich tasks that require fine-grained
control involving force, especially under visual occlusion or dynamic
uncertainty. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{ForceVLA}, a
novel end-to-end manipulation framework that treats external force sensing as a
first-class modality within VLA systems. ForceVLA introduces \textbf{FVLMoE}, a
force-aware Mixture-of-Experts fusion module that dynamically integrates
pretrained visual-language embeddings with real-time 6-axis force feedback
during action decoding. This enables context-aware routing across
modality-specific experts, enhancing the robot's ability to adapt to subtle
contact dynamics. We also introduce \textbf{ForceVLA-Data}, a new dataset
comprising synchronized vision, proprioception, and force-torque signals across
five contact-rich manipulation tasks. ForceVLA improves average task success by
23.2\% over strong $\pi_0$-based baselines, achieving up to 80\% success in
tasks such as plug insertion. Our approach highlights the importance of
multimodal integration for dexterous manipulation and sets a new benchmark for
physically intelligent robotic control. Code and data will be released at

safety-critical instance classes such as pedestrians, vehicles, and forklifts,

Conclusion: UP-SLAM在动态环境中表现优异，定位与渲染质量显著优于现有方法，同时生成可重用静态地图。

Abstract: Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques for Visual Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) have significantly progressed in tracking and
high-fidelity mapping. However, their sequential optimization framework and
sensitivity to dynamic objects limit real-time performance and robustness in
real-world scenarios. We present UP-SLAM, a real-time RGB-D SLAM system for
dynamic environments that decouples tracking and mapping through a parallelized
framework. A probabilistic octree is employed to manage Gaussian primitives
adaptively, enabling efficient initialization and pruning without hand-crafted
thresholds. To robustly filter dynamic regions during tracking, we propose a
training-free uncertainty estimator that fuses multi-modal residuals to
estimate per-pixel motion uncertainty, achieving open-set dynamic object
handling without reliance on semantic labels. Furthermore, a temporal encoder
is designed to enhance rendering quality. Concurrently, low-dimensional
features are efficiently transformed via a shallow multilayer perceptron to
construct DINO features, which are then employed to enrich the Gaussian field
and improve the robustness of uncertainty prediction. Extensive experiments on
multiple challenging datasets suggest that UP-SLAM outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both localization accuracy (by 59.8%) and rendering quality (by 4.57

Abstract: We propose ReinFlow, a simple yet effective online reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that fine-tunes a family of flow matching policies for
continuous robotic control. Derived from rigorous RL theory, ReinFlow injects
learnable noise into a flow policy's deterministic path, converting the flow
into a discrete-time Markov Process for exact and straightforward likelihood
computation. This conversion facilitates exploration and ensures training
stability, enabling ReinFlow to fine-tune diverse flow model variants,
including Rectified Flow [35] and Shortcut Models [19], particularly at very
few or even one denoising step. We benchmark ReinFlow in representative
locomotion and manipulation tasks, including long-horizon planning with visual
input and sparse reward. The episode reward of Rectified Flow policies obtained
an average net growth of 135.36% after fine-tuning in challenging legged
locomotion tasks while saving denoising steps and 82.63% of wall time compared
to state-of-the-art diffusion RL fine-tuning method DPPO [43]. The success rate
of the Shortcut Model policies in state and visual manipulation tasks achieved
an average net increase of 40.34% after fine-tuning with ReinFlow at four or
even one denoising step, whose performance is comparable to fine-tuned DDIM
policies while saving computation time for an average of 23.20%. Project

Result: 实验表明FAMER显著提升了任务执行和通信效率，使代理能快速适应用户特定需求。

Conclusion: FAMER框架有效解决了具身代理在复杂环境中快速对齐用户欲望的挑战。

Abstract: While embodied agents have made significant progress in performing complex
physical tasks, real-world applications demand more than pure task execution.
The agents must collaborate with unfamiliar agents and human users, whose goals
are often vague and implicit. In such settings, interpreting ambiguous
instructions and uncovering underlying desires is essential for effective
assistance. Therefore, fast and accurate desire alignment becomes a critical
capability for embodied agents. In this work, we first develop a home
assistance simulation environment HA-Desire that integrates an LLM-driven human
user agent exhibiting realistic value-driven goal selection and communication.
The ego agent must interact with this proxy user to infer and adapt to the
user's latent desires. To achieve this, we present a novel framework FAMER for
fast desire alignment, which introduces a desire-based mental reasoning
mechanism to identify user intent and filter desire-irrelevant actions. We
further design a reflection-based communication module that reduces redundant
inquiries, and incorporate goal-relevant information extraction with memory
persistence to improve information reuse and reduce unnecessary exploration.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances
both task execution and communication efficiency, enabling embodied agents to
quickly adapt to user-specific desires in complex embodied environments.

Result: 实验表明，SCIZOR平均提升15.4%的性能，且减少数据需求。

Conclusion: SCIZOR有效提升模仿学习效率，无需人工标注。

Abstract: Imitation learning advances robot capabilities by enabling the acquisition of
diverse behaviors from human demonstrations. However, large-scale datasets used
for policy training often introduce substantial variability in quality, which
can negatively impact performance. As a result, automatically curating datasets
by filtering low-quality samples to improve quality becomes essential. Existing
robotic curation approaches rely on costly manual annotations and perform
curation at a coarse granularity, such as the dataset or trajectory level,
failing to account for the quality of individual state-action pairs. To address
this, we introduce SCIZOR, a self-supervised data curation framework that
filters out low-quality state-action pairs to improve the performance of
imitation learning policies. SCIZOR targets two complementary sources of
low-quality data: suboptimal data, which hinders learning with undesirable
actions, and redundant data, which dilutes training with repetitive patterns.
SCIZOR leverages a self-supervised task progress predictor for suboptimal data
to remove samples lacking task progression, and a deduplication module
operating on joint state-action representation for samples with redundant
patterns. Empirically, we show that SCIZOR enables imitation learning policies
to achieve higher performance with less data, yielding an average improvement
of 15.4% across multiple benchmarks. More information is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在机器人领域取得进展，但复杂性和长训练时间仍是瓶颈。

Result: FastTD3在单A100 GPU上3小时内完成HumanoidBench任务，训练稳定。

Conclusion: FastTD3提供轻量级实现，加速机器人强化学习研究。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has driven significant progress in robotics, but
its complexity and long training times remain major bottlenecks. In this
report, we introduce FastTD3, a simple, fast, and capable RL algorithm that
significantly speeds up training for humanoid robots in popular suites such as

simulation, large-batch updates, a distributional critic, and carefully tuned
hyperparameters. FastTD3 solves a range of HumanoidBench tasks in under 3 hours
on a single A100 GPU, while remaining stable during training. We also provide a
lightweight and easy-to-use implementation of FastTD3 to accelerate RL research

### [478] [Towards Efficient Key-Value Cache Management for Prefix Prefilling in LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21919)
*Yue Zhu,Hao Yu,Chen Wang,Zhuoran Liu,Eun Kyung Lee*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）中键值缓存（KVC）管理的重要性，分析了实际访问模式，并评估了现有存储方案的不足，提出了对高效分布式缓存系统的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）上下文窗口的扩展，高效的键值缓存（KVC）管理对优化推理性能至关重要。特别是在检索增强生成（RAG）和代理等任务中，缓存的高复用性使得高效缓存成为减少冗余和提升速度的关键。

Method: 通过分析公开可用的KVC访问模式，评估了Redis等商业键值存储和基于RDMA的最先进系统（如CHIME和Sherman）在KVC元数据管理中的表现。

Result: 研究发现现有存储方案缺乏针对KVC预填充的定制化解决方案，凸显了需要一种高效的分布式缓存系统来优化LLM工作负载的元数据管理。

Conclusion: 论文为设计可扩展、低延迟的KVC管理系统提供了见解，强调了优化元数据管理的重要性。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) with extended context
windows necessitates efficient Key-Value Cache (KVC) management to optimize
inference performance. Inference workloads like Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) and agents exhibit high cache reusability, making efficient caching
critical to reducing redundancy and improving speed. We analyze real-world KVC
access patterns using publicly available traces and evaluate commercial
key-value stores like Redis and state-of-the-art RDMA-based systems (CHIME [1]
and Sherman [2]) for KVC metadata management. Our work demonstrates the lack of
tailored storage solution for KVC prefilling, underscores the need for an
efficient distributed caching system with optimized metadata management for LLM
workloads, and provides insights into designing improved KVC management systems
for scalable, low-latency inference.

TL;DR: 论文提出UI-Evol模块，解决知识执行差距问题，显著提升任务性能和代理可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现即使90%的知识正确，执行成功率仅为41%，需解决知识执行差距。

Method: UI-Evol模块包含回溯阶段（提取动作序列）和批评阶段（优化知识）。

Result: 实验表明UI-Evol显著提升任务性能并降低行为标准差。

Conclusion: UI-Evol有效解决知识执行问题，提升代理可靠性。

Abstract: External knowledge has played a crucial role in the recent development of
computer use agents. We identify a critical knowledge-execution gap: retrieved
knowledge often fails to translate into effective real-world task execution.
Our analysis shows even 90\% correct knowledge yields only 41\% execution
success rate. To bridge this gap, we propose UI-Evol, a plug-and-play module
for autonomous GUI knowledge evolution. UI-Evol consists of two stages: a
Retrace Stage that extracts faithful objective action sequences from actual
agent-environment interactions, and a Critique Stage that refines existing
knowledge by comparing these sequences against external references. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on the OSWorld benchmark with the state-of-the-art
Agent S2. Our results demonstrate that UI-Evol not only significantly boosts
task performance but also addresses a previously overlooked issue of high
behavioral standard deviation in computer use agents, leading to superior
performance on computer use tasks and substantially improved agent reliability.

TL;DR: MapStory是一个基于LLM的地图动画创作工具，通过自然语言脚本自动生成可编辑的动画序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在降低地图动画创作的门槛，提升创作效率和创意探索。

Method: 利用代理架构分解脚本为动画模块，结合LLM与网络搜索获取地理信息，并提供交互式时间线编辑器。

Result: 用户能轻松创建地图动画，加快迭代速度，并支持创意探索。

Conclusion: MapStory有效降低了地图故事创作的难度，提升了用户体验。

Abstract: We introduce MapStory, an LLM-powered animation authoring tool that generates
editable map animation sequences directly from natural language text. Given a
user-written script, MapStory leverages an agentic architecture to
automatically produce a scene breakdown, which decomposes the script into key
animation building blocks such as camera movements, visual highlights, and
animated elements. Our system includes a researcher component that accurately
queries geospatial information by leveraging an LLM with web search, enabling
the automatic extraction of relevant regions, paths, and coordinates while
allowing users to edit and query for changes or additional information to
refine the results. Additionally, users can fine-tune parameters of these
blocks through an interactive timeline editor. We detail the system's design
and architecture, informed by formative interviews with professional animators
and an analysis of 200 existing map animation videos. Our evaluation, which
includes expert interviews (N=5) and a usability study (N=12), demonstrates
that MapStory enables users to create map animations with ease, facilitates
faster iteration, encourages creative exploration, and lowers barriers to
creating map-centric stories.

Method: 采用多智能体LLM架构和VUI设计，与传统图形CMS进行可用性对比实验。

Result: VUI在简单任务中更受欢迎，内容质量与图形界面相当；混合界面可能解决认知负荷问题。

Conclusion: 语音界面在特定业务场景中具有潜力，混合界面可能是未来发展方向。

Abstract: In this study, we propose a solution based on a multi-agent LLM architecture
and a voice user interface (VUI) designed to update the knowledge base of a
digital assistant. Its usability is evaluated in comparison to a more
traditional graphical content management system (CMS), with a focus on
understanding the relationship between user preferences and the complexity of
the information being provided. The findings demonstrate that, while the
overall usability of the VUI is rated lower than the graphical interface, it is
already preferred by users for less complex tasks. Furthermore, the quality of
content entered through the VUI is comparable to that achieved with the
graphical interface, even for highly complex tasks. Obtained qualitative
results suggest that a hybrid interface combining the strengths of both
approaches could address the key challenges identified during the experiment,
such as reducing cognitive load through graphical feedback while maintaining
the intuitive nature of voice-based interactions. This work highlights the
potential of conversational interfaces as a viable and effective method for
knowledge management in specific business contexts.

Abstract: In the intelligent era, the interaction between humans and intelligent
systems fundamentally involves collaboration with autonomous intelligent
agents. Human-AI Collaboration (HAC) represents a novel type of human-machine
relationship facilitated by autonomous intelligent machines equipped with AI
technologies. In this paradigm, AI agents serve not only as auxiliary tools but

leadership roles in the collaboration. This human-led collaboration imparts new
dimensions to the human-machine relationship, necessitating innovative research
perspectives, paradigms, and agenda to address the unique challenges posed by
HAC. This chapter delves into the essence of HAC from the human-centered
perspective, outlining its core concepts and distinguishing features. It
reviews the current research methodologies and research agenda within the HAC
field from the HCAI perspective, highlighting advancements and ongoing studies.
Furthermore, a framework for human-centered HAC (HCHAC) is proposed by
integrating these reviews and analyses. A case study of HAC in the context of
autonomous vehicles is provided, illustrating practical applications and the
synergistic interactions between humans and AI agents. Finally, it identifies
potential future research directions aimed at enhancing the effectiveness,

Result: Web of Agents为实现互操作性代理系统迈出了关键一步，为生态系统碎片化问题提供了实用解决方案。

Conclusion: 互操作性是智能代理生态系统的关键，Web of Agents为此提供了可行的技术路径。

Abstract: Collaborative agentic AI is projected to transform entire industries by
enabling AI-powered agents to autonomously perceive, plan, and act within
digital environments. Yet, current solutions in this field are all built in
isolation, and we are rapidly heading toward a landscape of fragmented,
incompatible ecosystems. In this position paper, we argue that
interoperability, achieved by the adoption of minimal standards, is essential
to ensure open, secure, web-scale, and widely-adopted agentic ecosystems. To
this end, we devise a minimal architectural foundation for collaborative
agentic AI, named Web of Agents, which is composed of four components:
agent-to-agent messaging, interaction interoperability, state management, and
agent discovery. Web of Agents adopts existing standards and reuses existing
infrastructure where possible. With Web of Agents, we take the first but
critical step toward interoperable agentic systems and offer a pragmatic path
forward before ecosystem fragmentation becomes the norm.

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验验证了MetaSTNet的高效性和有效性。

Conclusion: MetaSTNet能够在小样本情况下快速适应并提供准确预测。

Abstract: Network traffic prediction techniques have attracted much attention since
they are valuable for network congestion control and user experience
improvement. While existing prediction techniques can achieve favorable
performance when there is sufficient training data, it remains a great
challenge to make accurate predictions when only a small amount of training
data is available. To tackle this problem, we propose a deep learning model,
entitled MetaSTNet, based on a multimodal meta-learning framework. It is an
end-to-end network architecture that trains the model in a simulator and
transfers the meta-knowledge to a real-world environment, which can quickly
adapt and obtain accurate predictions on a new task with only a small amount of
real-world training data. In addition, we further employ cross conformal
prediction to assess the calibrated prediction intervals. Extensive experiments
have been conducted on real-world datasets to illustrate the efficiency and
effectiveness of MetaSTNet.

Abstract: Anomalies are common in network system monitoring. When manifested as network
threats to be mitigated, service outages to be prevented, and security risks to
be ameliorated, detecting such anomalous network behaviors becomes of great
importance. However, the growing scale and complexity of the mobile
communication networks, as well as the ever-increasing amount and
dimensionality of the network surveillance data, make it extremely difficult to
monitor a mobile network and discover abnormal network behaviors. Recent
advances in machine learning allow for obtaining near-optimal solutions to
complicated decision-making problems with many sources of uncertainty that
cannot be accurately characterized by traditional mathematical models. However,
most machine learning algorithms are centralized, which renders them
inapplicable to a large-scale distributed wireless networks with tens of
millions of mobile devices. In this article, we present fog intelligence, a
distributed machine learning architecture that enables intelligent wireless
network management. It preserves the advantage of both edge processing and
centralized cloud computing. In addition, the proposed architecture is
scalable, privacy-preserving, and well suited for intelligent management of a
distributed wireless network.

Abstract: Predicting the risk of developing breast cancer is an important clinical tool
to guide early intervention and tailoring personalized screening strategies.
Early risk models have limited performance and recently machine learning-based
analysis of mammogram images showed encouraging risk prediction effects. These
models however are limited to the use of a single exam or tend to overlook
nuanced breast tissue evolvement in spatial and temporal details of
longitudinal imaging exams that are indicative of breast cancer risk. In this
paper, we propose STA-Risk (Spatial and Temporal Asymmetry-based Risk
Prediction), a novel Transformer-based model that captures fine-grained
mammographic imaging evolution simultaneously from bilateral and longitudinal
asymmetries for breast cancer risk prediction. STA-Risk is innovative by the
side encoding and temporal encoding to learn spatial-temporal asymmetries,
regulated by a customized asymmetry loss. We performed extensive experiments
with two independent mammogram datasets and achieved superior performance than
four representative SOTA models for 1- to 5-year future risk prediction. Source
codes will be released upon publishing of the paper.

Conclusion: 该轻量级且隐私保护的框架为医学AI协作开发提供了新途径，同时保障数据机密性。

Abstract: The automated generation of radiology reports from chest X-ray images holds
significant promise in enhancing diagnostic workflows while preserving patient
privacy. Traditional centralized approaches often require sensitive data
transfer, posing privacy concerns. To address this, the study proposes a
Multimodal Federated Learning framework for chest X-ray report generation using
the IU-Xray dataset. The system utilizes a Vision Transformer (ViT) as the
encoder and GPT-2 as the report generator, enabling decentralized training
without sharing raw data. Three Federated Learning (FL) aggregation strategies:
FedAvg, Krum Aggregation and a novel Loss-aware Federated Averaging (L-FedAvg)
were evaluated. Among these, Krum Aggregation demonstrated superior performance
across lexical and semantic evaluation metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU, BERTScore
and RaTEScore. The results show that FL can match or surpass centralized models
in generating clinically relevant and semantically rich radiology reports. This
lightweight and privacy-preserving framework paves the way for collaborative
medical AI development without compromising data confidentiality.

Conclusion: Digepath填补了病理实践的空白，为胃肠道疾病提供了AI驱动的精准病理学解决方案，并可推广至其他病理学领域。

Abstract: Gastrointestinal (GI) diseases represent a clinically significant burden,
necessitating precise diagnostic approaches to optimize patient outcomes.
Conventional histopathological diagnosis, heavily reliant on the subjective
interpretation of pathologists, suffers from limited reproducibility and
diagnostic variability. To overcome these limitations and address the lack of
pathology-specific foundation models for GI diseases, we develop Digepath, a
specialized foundation model for GI pathology. Our framework introduces a
dual-phase iterative optimization strategy combining pretraining with
fine-screening, specifically designed to address the detection of sparsely
distributed lesion areas in whole-slide images. Digepath is pretrained on more
than 353 million image patches from over 200,000 hematoxylin and eosin-stained
slides of GI diseases. It attains state-of-the-art performance on 33 out of 34
tasks related to GI pathology, including pathological diagnosis, molecular
prediction, gene mutation prediction, and prognosis evaluation, particularly in
diagnostically ambiguous cases and resolution-agnostic tissue classification.We
further translate the intelligent screening module for early GI cancer and
achieve near-perfect 99.6% sensitivity across 9 independent medical
institutions nationwide. The outstanding performance of Digepath highlights its
potential to bridge critical gaps in histopathological practice. This work not
only advances AI-driven precision pathology for GI diseases but also
establishes a transferable paradigm for other pathology subspecialties.

*Sajal Chakroborty,Suddhasattwa Das*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于概率空间解释的数据驱动去噪方法，将真实图像恢复为条件期望，并通过核积分算子估计概率空间积分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统去噪方法通过投影到子空间估计真实图像，但这种方法在概率空间解释下可能不保证无偏和收敛。

Method: 将真实图像重新表述为再生核希尔伯特空间（RKHS）中线性方程的最小二乘解，利用核积分算子作为线性变换。

Result: 方法在像素数量趋于无穷时收敛，且可用于有限像素图像中选择最优参数。

Conclusion: 该方法在理论和实践上均优于传统投影去噪技术。

Abstract: All techniques for denoising involve a notion of a true (noise-free) image,
and a hypothesis space. The hypothesis space may reconstruct the image directly
as a grayscale valued function, or indirectly by its Fourier or wavelet
spectrum. Most common techniques estimate the true image as a projection to
some subspace. We propose an interpretation of a noisy image as a collection of
samples drawn from a certain probability space. Within this interpretation,
projection based approaches are not guaranteed to be unbiased and convergent.
We present a data-driven denoising method in which the true image is recovered
as a conditional expectation. Although the probability space is unknown
apriori, integrals on this space can be estimated by kernel integral operators.
The true image is reformulated as the least squares solution to a linear
equation in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and involving various
kernel integral operators as linear transforms. Assuming the true image to be a
continuous function on a compact planar domain, the technique is shown to be
convergent as the number of pixels goes to infinity. We also show that for a
picture with finite number of pixels, the convergence result can be used to
choose the various parameters for an optimum denoising result.

Result: 在五个数据库上，TaylorKAN表现优于其他KAN模型，验证了其泛化能力。

Conclusion: TaylorKAN是高效且鲁棒的高维分数回归模型。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) has attracted growing interest for its strong
function approximation capability. In our previous work, KAN and its variants
were explored in score regression for blind image quality assessment (BIQA).
However, these models encounter challenges when processing high-dimensional
features, leading to limited performance gains and increased computational
cost. To address these issues, we propose TaylorKAN that leverages the Taylor
expansions as learnable activation functions to enhance local approximation
capability. To improve the computational efficiency, network depth reduction
and feature dimensionality compression are integrated into the TaylorKAN-based
score regression pipeline. On five databases (BID, CLIVE, KonIQ, SPAQ, and
FLIVE) with authentic distortions, extensive experiments demonstrate that
TaylorKAN consistently outperforms the other KAN-related models, indicating
that the local approximation via Taylor expansions is more effective than
global approximation using orthogonal functions. Its generalization capacity is
validated through inter-database experiments. The findings highlight the
potential of TaylorKAN as an efficient and robust model for high-dimensional
score regression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型（如ResNet50）在皮肤癌分类中计算开销大，难以在资源受限环境中部署。

Method: 设计了一种自定义CNN模型，大幅减少参数和FLOPs。

Result: 模型参数减少96.7%，FLOPs降至30.04百万，分类精度偏差小于0.022%。

Conclusion: 轻量级CNN在资源受限环境中更具实用性，平衡了模型复杂性与实际可行性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep learning in medical image analysis has greatly
enhanced the accuracy of skin cancer classification. However, current
state-of-the-art models, especially those based on transfer learning like
ResNet50, come with significant computational overhead, rendering them
impractical for deployment in resource-constrained environments. This study
proposes a custom CNN model that achieves a 96.7\% reduction in parameters
(from 23.9 million in ResNet50 to 692,000) while maintaining a classification
accuracy deviation of less than 0.022\%. Our empirical analysis of the HAM10000
dataset reveals that although transfer learning models provide a marginal
accuracy improvement of approximately 0.022\%, they result in a staggering
13,216.76\% increase in FLOPs, considerably raising computational costs and
inference latency. In contrast, our lightweight CNN architecture, which
encompasses only 30.04 million FLOPs compared to ResNet50's 4.00 billion,
significantly reduces energy consumption, memory footprint, and inference time.
These findings underscore the trade-off between the complexity of deep models
and their real-world feasibility, positioning our optimized CNN as a practical

Result: 在公开数据集上验证，ULW方法在视觉清晰度和定量评估中表现优异。

Conclusion: ULW方法为腹腔镜图像实时增强提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Laparoscopic surgeries often suffer from reduced visual clarity due to the
presence of surgical smoke originated by surgical instruments, which poses
significant challenges for both surgeons and vision based computer-assisted
technologies. In order to remove the surgical smoke, a novel U-Net deep
learning with new loss function and integrated differentiable Wiener filter
(ULW) method is presented. Specifically, the new loss function integrates the
pixel, structural, and perceptual properties. Thus, the new loss function,
which combines the structural similarity index measure loss, the perceptual
loss, as well as the mean squared error loss, is able to enhance the quality
and realism of the reconstructed images. Furthermore, the learnable Wiener
filter is capable of effectively modelling the degradation process caused by
the surgical smoke. The effectiveness of the proposed ULW method is evaluated
using the publicly available paired laparoscopic smoke and smoke-free image
dataset, which provides reliable benchmarking and quantitative comparisons.
Experimental results show that the proposed ULW method excels in both visual
clarity and metric-based evaluation. As a result, the proposed ULW method
offers a promising solution for real-time enhancement of laparoscopic imagery.

TL;DR: MAMBO-NET提出了一种多因果感知建模后门干预优化网络，用于解决医学图像分割中的混淆因素问题，显著提升了分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割通常假设图像到分割的过程是无偏的，忽略了混淆因素（如解剖变异和成像模态限制）的影响，导致分割结果不理想。

Method: MAMBO-NET利用多高斯分布自建模拟合混淆因素，并引入因果干预技术，设计后验概率约束以优化训练过程。

Result: 在五个医学图像数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著降低了混淆因素的影响，提升了分割准确性。

Conclusion: MAMBO-NET通过因果干预和优化建模有效解决了医学图像分割中的混淆问题，为相关任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation methods generally assume that the process from
medical image to segmentation is unbiased, and use neural networks to establish
conditional probability models to complete the segmentation task. This
assumption does not consider confusion factors, which can affect medical
images, such as complex anatomical variations and imaging modality limitations.
Confusion factors obfuscate the relevance and causality of medical image
segmentation, leading to unsatisfactory segmentation results. To address this
issue, we propose a multi-causal aware modeling backdoor-intervention
optimization (MAMBO-NET) network for medical image segmentation. Drawing
insights from causal inference, MAMBO-NET utilizes self-modeling with
multi-Gaussian distributions to fit the confusion factors and introduce causal
intervention into the segmentation process. Moreover, we design appropriate
posterior probability constraints to effectively train the distributions of
confusion factors. For the distributions to effectively guide the segmentation
and mitigate and eliminate the Impact of confusion factors on the segmentation,
we introduce classical backdoor intervention techniques and analyze their
feasibility in the segmentation task. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we conducted extensive experiments on five medical image datasets.
The results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the influence of
confusion factors, leading to enhanced segmentation accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Vision Transformer (ViT)的四通道PPG信号图像表示方法，用于ECG重建，显著优于传统1D卷积方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPG到ECG的重建具有挑战性，现有方法难以捕捉细粒度波形特征。

Method: 使用四通道PPG信号（原始PPG、一阶差分、二阶差分和曲线下面积）结合ViT的自注意力机制。

Result: 实验显示PRD降低29%，RMSE降低15%，并在其他指标上表现优异。

Conclusion: 四通道信号图像与ViT结合能更有效地提取PPG特征，为循环信号分析开辟新途径。

Abstract: Reconstructing ECG from PPG is a promising yet challenging task. While recent
advancements in generative models have significantly improved ECG
reconstruction, accurately capturing fine-grained waveform features remains a
key challenge. To address this, we propose a novel PPG-to-ECG reconstruction
method that leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) as the core network. Unlike
conventional approaches that rely on single-channel PPG, our method employs a
four-channel signal image representation, incorporating the original PPG, its
first-order difference, second-order difference, and area under the curve. This
multi-channel design enriches feature extraction by preserving both temporal
and physiological variations within the PPG. By leveraging the self-attention
mechanism in ViT, our approach effectively captures both inter-beat and
intra-beat dependencies, leading to more robust and accurate ECG
reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing 1D convolution-based approaches, achieving up to 29%
reduction in PRD and 15% reduction in RMSE. The proposed approach also produces
improvements in other evaluation metrics, highlighting its robustness and
effectiveness in reconstructing ECG signals. Furthermore, to ensure a
clinically relevant evaluation, we introduce new performance metrics, including
QRS area error, PR interval error, RT interval error, and RT amplitude
difference error. Our findings suggest that integrating a four-channel signal
image representation with the self-attention mechanism of ViT enables more
effective extraction of informative PPG features and improved modeling of
beat-to-beat variations for PPG-to-ECG mapping. Beyond demonstrating the
potential of PPG as a viable alternative for heart activity monitoring, our
approach opens new avenues for cyclic signal analysis and prediction.

Conclusion: 机器遗忘可作为临床应用中模型维护的模块化、实用替代方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training samples
from a trained model without full retraining. While prior work has largely
focused on privacy-motivated settings, we recast unlearning as a
general-purpose tool for post-deployment model revision. Specifically, we focus
on utilizing unlearning in clinical contexts where data shifts, device
deprecation, and policy changes are common. To this end, we propose a bilevel
optimization formulation of boundary-based unlearning that can be solved using
iterative algorithms. We provide convergence guarantees when first-order
algorithms are used to unlearn. Our method introduces tunable loss design for
controlling the forgetting-retention tradeoff and supports novel model
composition strategies that merge the strengths of distinct unlearning runs.
Across benchmark and real-world clinical imaging datasets, our approach
outperforms baselines on both forgetting and retention metrics, including
scenarios involving imaging devices and anatomical outliers. This work
establishes machine unlearning as a modular, practical alternative to
retraining for real-world model maintenance in clinical applications.

Result: 合成图像与真实数据在器官体积和代谢活性上高度一致，代谢摄取值偏差在3-5%以内。

Conclusion: 级联3D扩散模型能生成解剖和代谢准确的PET/CT图像，为临床和研究提供可扩展的合成成像方案。

Abstract: We propose a cascaded 3D diffusion model framework to synthesize
high-fidelity 3D PET/CT volumes directly from demographic variables, addressing
the growing need for realistic digital twins in oncologic imaging, virtual
trials, and AI-driven data augmentation. Unlike deterministic phantoms, which
rely on predefined anatomical and metabolic templates, our method employs a
two-stage generative process. An initial score-based diffusion model
synthesizes low-resolution PET/CT volumes from demographic variables alone,
providing global anatomical structures and approximate metabolic activity. This
is followed by a super-resolution residual diffusion model that refines spatial
resolution. Our framework was trained on 18-F FDG PET/CT scans from the AutoPET
dataset and evaluated using organ-wise volume and standardized uptake value
(SUV) distributions, comparing synthetic and real data between demographic
subgroups. The organ-wise comparison demonstrated strong concordance between
synthetic and real images. In particular, most deviations in metabolic uptake
values remained within 3-5% of the ground truth in subgroup analysis. These
findings highlight the potential of cascaded 3D diffusion models to generate
anatomically and metabolically accurate PET/CT images, offering a robust
alternative to traditional phantoms and enabling scalable, population-informed
synthetic imaging for clinical and research applications.

prediction to address critical clinical requirements. Our model simultaneously
performs classification, segmentation, and landmark detection, leveraging the
synergistic relationship between these tasks to improve overall performance. We
further enhance clinical reliability through risk-sensitive conformal
prediction, which provides statistically guaranteed prediction sets with higher
reliability for clinically critical findings. Experimental results demonstrate
excellent performance with 90.68\% overall empirical coverage and 99.29\%
coverage for critical conditions, while maintaining remarkable precision in
prediction sets. Most importantly, our risk-sensitive approach achieves zero
high-risk mispredictions (cases where the system dangerously declares
problematic tubes as confidently normal), making the system particularly
suitable for clinical deployment. This work offers both accurate predictions
and reliably quantified uncertainty -- essential features for life-critical
medical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过非侵入性方法生成内部解剖图像，避免传统成像技术的风险。

Method: 分为三个阶段：表面补全、粗CT合成和CT超分辨率，均基于3D流匹配技术。

Result: 在700例测试中表现出高解剖保真度，器官体积误差小，肌肉/脂肪组成与真实数据强相关。

Conclusion: Surf2CT为非侵入性内部成像开辟了新途径，适用于家庭医疗和个性化临床评估。

Abstract: We present Surf2CT, a novel cascaded flow matching framework that synthesizes
full 3D computed tomography (CT) volumes of the human torso from external
surface scans and simple demographic data (age, sex, height, weight). This is
the first approach capable of generating realistic volumetric internal anatomy
images solely based on external body shape and demographics, without any
internal imaging. Surf2CT proceeds through three sequential stages: (1) Surface
Completion, reconstructing a complete signed distance function (SDF) from
partial torso scans using conditional 3D flow matching; (2) Coarse CT
Synthesis, generating a low-resolution CT volume from the completed SDF and
demographic information; and (3) CT Super-Resolution, refining the coarse
volume into a high-resolution CT via a patch-wise conditional flow model. Each
stage utilizes a 3D-adapted EDM2 backbone trained via flow matching. We trained
our model on a combined dataset of 3,198 torso CT scans (approximately 1.13
million axial slices) sourced from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and the
AutoPET challenge. Evaluation on 700 paired torso surface-CT cases demonstrated
strong anatomical fidelity: organ volumes exhibited small mean percentage
differences (range from -11.1% to 4.4%), and muscle/fat body composition
metrics matched ground truth with strong correlation (range from 0.67 to 0.96).
Lung localization had minimal bias (mean difference -2.5 mm), and surface
completion significantly improved metrics (Chamfer distance: from 521.8 mm to
2.7 mm; Intersection-over-Union: from 0.87 to 0.98). Surf2CT establishes a new
paradigm for non-invasive internal anatomical imaging using only external data,
opening opportunities for home-based healthcare, preventive medicine, and
personalized clinical assessments without the risks associated with
conventional imaging techniques.

Motivation: CT重建核会影响定量成像测量的空间分辨率和噪声特性，导致系统变异性，因此选择合适的核对于一致的定量分析至关重要。

Method: 使用多路径cycleGAN模型，结合配对和非配对数据训练，通过特定领域的编码器和解码器以及共享潜在空间实现核协调化。

Conclusion: 共享潜在空间的多路径cycleGAN能够实现稳健的核协调化，提升肺气肿定量分析的准确性并保持解剖保真度。

Abstract: Reconstruction kernels in computed tomography (CT) affect spatial resolution
and noise characteristics, introducing systematic variability in quantitative
imaging measurements such as emphysema quantification. Choosing an appropriate
kernel is therefore essential for consistent quantitative analysis. We propose
a multipath cycleGAN model for CT kernel harmonization, trained on a mixture of
paired and unpaired data from a low-dose lung cancer screening cohort. The
model features domain-specific encoders and decoders with a shared latent space
and uses discriminators tailored for each domain.We train the model on 42
kernel combinations using 100 scans each from seven representative kernels in
the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) dataset. To evaluate performance, 240
scans from each kernel are harmonized to a reference soft kernel, and emphysema
is quantified before and after harmonization. A general linear model assesses
the impact of age, sex, smoking status, and kernel on emphysema. We also
evaluate harmonization from soft kernels to a reference hard kernel. To assess
anatomical consistency, we compare segmentations of lung vessels, muscle, and
subcutaneous adipose tissue generated by TotalSegmentator between harmonized
and original images. Our model is benchmarked against traditional and
switchable cycleGANs. For paired kernels, our approach reduces bias in
emphysema scores, as seen in Bland-Altman plots (p<0.05). For unpaired kernels,
harmonization eliminates confounding differences in emphysema (p>0.05). High
Dice scores confirm preservation of muscle and fat anatomy, while lung vessel
overlap remains reasonable. Overall, our shared latent space multipath cycleGAN
enables robust harmonization across paired and unpaired CT kernels, improving
emphysema quantification and preserving anatomical fidelity.

Abstract: Three-dimensional ultrasound enables real-time volumetric visualization of
anatomical structures. Unlike traditional 2D ultrasound, 3D imaging reduces the
reliance on precise probe orientation, potentially making ultrasound more
accessible to clinicians with varying levels of experience and improving
automated measurements and post-exam analysis. However, achieving both high
volume rates and high image quality remains a significant challenge. While 3D
diverging waves can provide high volume rates, they suffer from limited tissue
harmonic generation and increased multipath effects, which degrade image
quality. One compromise is to retain the focusing in elevation while leveraging
unfocused diverging waves in the lateral direction to reduce the number of
transmissions per elevation plane. Reaching the volume rates achieved by full
3D diverging waves, however, requires dramatically undersampling the number of
elevation planes. Subsequently, to render the full volume, simple interpolation
techniques are applied. This paper introduces a novel approach to 3D ultrasound
reconstruction from a reduced set of elevation planes by employing diffusion
models (DMs) to achieve increased spatial and temporal resolution. We compare
both traditional and supervised deep learning-based interpolation methods on a
3D cardiac ultrasound dataset. Our results show that DM-based reconstruction
consistently outperforms the baselines in image quality and downstream task
performance. Additionally, we accelerate inference by leveraging the temporal
consistency inherent to ultrasound sequences. Finally, we explore the
robustness of the proposed method by exploiting the probabilistic nature of
diffusion posterior sampling to quantify reconstruction uncertainty and
demonstrate improved recall on out-of-distribution data with synthetic
anomalies under strong subsampling.

Motivation: 传统渲染方法通常基于物理模拟，计算复杂且耗时。RenderFormer旨在通过序列到序列的转换简化渲染过程，避免逐场景优化。

Result: 在形状和光传输复杂度不同的场景中验证了RenderFormer的有效性。

Conclusion: RenderFormer提供了一种高效且灵活的渲染方法，无需逐场景训练，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: We present RenderFormer, a neural rendering pipeline that directly renders an
image from a triangle-based representation of a scene with full global
illumination effects and that does not require per-scene training or
fine-tuning. Instead of taking a physics-centric approach to rendering, we
formulate rendering as a sequence-to-sequence transformation where a sequence
of tokens representing triangles with reflectance properties is converted to a
sequence of output tokens representing small patches of pixels. RenderFormer
follows a two stage pipeline: a view-independent stage that models
triangle-to-triangle light transport, and a view-dependent stage that
transforms a token representing a bundle of rays to the corresponding pixel
values guided by the triangle-sequence from the view-independent stage. Both
stages are based on the transformer architecture and are learned with minimal
prior constraints. We demonstrate and evaluate RenderFormer on scenes with
varying complexity in shape and light transport.

Result: 实验表明，STDR模块显著提升了重建质量和时空一致性。

Conclusion: STDR为动态场景重建提供了一种有效的时空解耦解决方案。

Abstract: Although dynamic scene reconstruction has long been a fundamental challenge
in 3D vision, the recent emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a
promising direction by enabling high-quality, real-time rendering through
explicit Gaussian primitives. However, existing 3DGS-based methods for dynamic
reconstruction often suffer from \textit{spatio-temporal incoherence} during
initialization, where canonical Gaussians are constructed by aggregating
observations from multiple frames without temporal distinction. This results in
spatio-temporally entangled representations, making it difficult to model
dynamic motion accurately. To overcome this limitation, we propose
\textbf{STDR} (Spatio-Temporal Decoupling for Real-time rendering), a
plug-and-play module that learns spatio-temporal probability distributions for
each Gaussian. STDR introduces a spatio-temporal mask, a separated deformation
field, and a consistency regularization to jointly disentangle spatial and
temporal patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that incorporating our
module into existing 3DGS-based dynamic scene reconstruction frameworks leads
to notable improvements in both reconstruction quality and spatio-temporal
consistency across synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了全局和局部模型的优势，实现了高精度的面部动画重定向。

Abstract: Accurately retargeting facial expressions to a face mesh while enabling
manipulation is a key challenge in facial animation retargeting. Recent
deep-learning methods address this by encoding facial expressions into a global
latent code, but they often fail to capture fine-grained details in local
regions. While some methods improve local accuracy by transferring deformations
locally, this often complicates overall control of the facial expression. To
address this, we propose a method that combines the strengths of both global
and local deformation models. Our approach enables intuitive control and
detailed expression cloning across diverse face meshes, regardless of their
underlying structures. The core idea is to localize the influence of the global
latent code on the target mesh. Our model learns to predict skinning weights
for each vertex of the target face mesh through indirect supervision from
predefined segmentation labels. These predicted weights localize the global
latent code, enabling precise and region-specific deformations even for meshes
with unseen shapes. We supervise the latent code using Facial Action Coding
System (FACS)-based blendshapes to ensure interpretability and allow
straightforward editing of the generated animation. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate improved performance over state-of-the-art methods
in terms of expression fidelity, deformation transfer accuracy, and
adaptability across diverse mesh structures.

Motivation: 由于机器学习在模拟难以采样系统中的应用增多，但缺乏理论理解可能导致次优实现，本文旨在填补这一理论空白。

Method: 采用Sequential Tempering方法，结合浅层MADE架构和Curie-Weiss模型，分析优化权重和梯度下降训练，并比较是否加入局部Metropolis Monte Carlo步骤。

Result: 提供了优化权重的解析描述和梯度下降训练的理论预测，明确了Sequential Tempering的最佳应用方式。

Conclusion: 本文为机器学习技术与Monte Carlo采样的结合奠定了清晰的理论基础。

Abstract: Recent years have seen a rise in the application of machine learning
techniques to aid the simulation of hard-to-sample systems that cannot be
studied using traditional methods. Despite the introduction of many different
architectures and procedures, a wide theoretical understanding is still
lacking, with the risk of suboptimal implementations. As a first step to
address this gap, we provide here a complete analytic study of the widely-used
Sequential Tempering procedure applied to a shallow MADE architecture for the
Curie-Weiss model. The contribution of this work is twofold: firstly, we give a
description of the optimal weights and of the training under Gradient Descent
optimization. Secondly, we compare what happens in Sequential Tempering with
and without the addition of local Metropolis Monte Carlo steps. We are thus
able to give theoretical predictions on the best procedure to apply in this
case. This work establishes a clear theoretical basis for the integration of
machine learning techniques into Monte Carlo sampling and optimization.

### [508] [OpenReview Should be Protected and Leveraged as a Community Asset for Research in the Era of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21537)
*Hao Sun,Yunyi Shen,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文主张利用OpenReview作为LLM时代的研究核心资源，提升同行评审质量、支持开放式基准测试和促进对齐研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在LLM时代，高质量、领域丰富且持续更新的数据集对捕捉专家知识和人类价值观至关重要。OpenReview作为研究论文、评审和决策的持续更新库，具有独特价值。

Method: 提出利用OpenReview的三个方面：提升同行评审的质量与可扩展性、支持基于专家讨论的开放式基准测试、促进对齐研究。

Result: 建议社区合作探索标准化基准和使用指南，推动负责任的数据使用和伦理讨论。

Conclusion: OpenReview应作为LLM时代研究的重要资产，社区需共同探讨其潜力和伦理问题。

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), high-quality, domain-rich, and
continuously evolving datasets capturing expert-level knowledge, core human
values, and reasoning are increasingly valuable. This position paper argues
that OpenReview -- the continually evolving repository of research papers, peer
reviews, author rebuttals, meta-reviews, and decision outcomes -- should be
leveraged more broadly as a core community asset for advancing research in the
era of LLMs. We highlight three promising areas in which OpenReview can
uniquely contribute: enhancing the quality, scalability, and accountability of
peer review processes; enabling meaningful, open-ended benchmarks rooted in
genuine expert deliberation; and supporting alignment research through
real-world interactions reflecting expert assessment, intentions, and
scientific values. To better realize these opportunities, we suggest the
community collaboratively explore standardized benchmarks and usage guidelines
around OpenReview, inviting broader dialogue on responsible data use, ethical
considerations, and collective stewardship.

*Jennifer Turliuk,Alejandro Sevilla,Daniela Gorza,Tod Hynes*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了结合人类与AI评估的气候科技初创企业选拔方法，展示了混合模型在提高效率和准确性方面的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过混合模型减少偏见、提升决策质量，并探索AI与人类评估的互补性。

Method: 分三阶段：AI初筛、人类半决赛评审、混合权重决赛，结合AI与人类评分。

Result: AI与人类评分呈中度正相关（Spearman's = 0.47），决赛前四名均被AI高分评价，验证了互补性。

Conclusion: 混合模型能优化初创企业评估，为未来竞赛提供框架，结合人类专业性与AI能力。

Abstract: This case study examines the ClimaTech Great Global Innovation Challenge's
approach to selecting climate tech startups by integrating human and AI
evaluations. The competition aimed to identify top startups and enhance the
accuracy and efficiency of the selection process through a hybrid model.
Research shows data-driven approaches help VC firms reduce bias and improve
decision-making. Machine learning models have outperformed human investors in
deal screening, helping identify high-potential startups. Incorporating AI
aimed to ensure more equitable and objective evaluations.
  The methodology included three phases: initial AI review, semi-finals judged
by humans, and finals using a hybrid weighting. In phase one, 57 applications
were scored by an AI tool built with StackAI and OpenAI's GPT-4o, and the top
36 advanced. In the semi-finals, human judges, unaware of AI scores, evaluated
startups on team quality, market potential, and technological innovation. Each
score - human or AI - was weighted equally, resulting in 75 percent human and
25 percent AI influence. In the finals, with five human judges, weighting
shifted to 83.3 percent human and 16.7 percent AI. There was a moderate
positive correlation between AI and human scores - Spearman's = 0.47 -
indicating general alignment with key differences. Notably, the final four
startups, selected mainly by humans, were among those rated highest by the AI.
This highlights the complementary nature of AI and human judgment. The study
shows that hybrid models can streamline and improve startup assessments. The
ClimaTech approach offers a strong framework for future competitions by
combining human expertise with AI capabilities.

Motivation: 当前AI系统在关键领域应用广泛，但其不透明性导致监管挑战，传统解释性方法不足以应对高风险场景。

Method: 提出基于有效性和解释性的分类法，分析多国监管案例，设计以验证为中心的政策框架。

Result: 验证能提升社会信任、公平和安全性，尤其在解释性受限时；分类法揭示解释性与输出可靠性的权衡。

Conclusion: 验证导向的监管框架为高性能但不透明的AI系统提供了治理路径，平衡创新与责任。

Abstract: Artificial Knowledge (AK) systems are transforming decision-making across
critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. However,
their growing opacity presents governance challenges that current regulatory
approaches, focused predominantly on explainability, fail to address
adequately. This article argues for a shift toward validation as a central
regulatory pillar. Validation, ensuring the reliability, consistency, and
robustness of AI outputs, offers a more practical, scalable, and risk-sensitive
alternative to explainability, particularly in high-stakes contexts where
interpretability may be technically or economically unfeasible. We introduce a
typology based on two axes, validity and explainability, classifying AK systems
into four categories and exposing the trade-offs between interpretability and
output reliability. Drawing on comparative analysis of regulatory approaches in
the EU, US, UK, and China, we show how validation can enhance societal trust,
fairness, and safety even where explainability is limited. We propose a
forward-looking policy framework centered on pre- and post-deployment
validation, third-party auditing, harmonized standards, and liability
incentives. This framework balances innovation with accountability and provides
a governance roadmap for responsibly integrating opaque, high-performing AK
systems into society.

Conclusion: AITEE展示了代理辅导系统在电气工程教育中的潜力，可实现可扩展、个性化的学习环境。

Abstract: Intelligent tutoring systems combined with large language models offer a
promising approach to address students' diverse needs and promote
self-efficacious learning. While large language models possess good
foundational knowledge of electrical engineering basics, they remain
insufficiently capable of addressing specific questions about electrical
circuits. In this paper, we present AITEE, an agent-based tutoring system for
electrical engineering designed to accompany students throughout their learning
process, offer individualized support, and promote self-directed learning.
AITEE supports both hand-drawn and digital circuits through an adapted circuit
reconstruction process, enabling natural interaction with students. Our novel
graph-based similarity measure identifies relevant context from lecture
materials through a retrieval augmented generation approach, while parallel
Spice simulation further enhances accuracy in applying solution methodologies.
The system implements a Socratic dialogue to foster learner autonomy through
guided questioning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that AITEE
significantly outperforms baseline approaches in domain-specific knowledge
application, with even medium-sized LLM models showing acceptable performance.
Our results highlight the potential of agentic tutors to deliver scalable,
personalized, and effective learning environments for electrical engineering
education.

Result: 提供托管版和开源代码，支持研究者进行安全实验。

Conclusion: PDS为数字话语研究提供了安全可控的环境，促进了对AI行为的理解。

Abstract: Social media serves as a primary communication and information dissemination
platform for major global events, entertainment, and niche or topically focused
community discussions. Therefore, it represents a valuable resource for
researchers who aim to understand numerous questions. However, obtaining data
can be difficult, expensive, and often unreliable due to the presence of bots,
fake accounts, and manipulated content. Additionally, there are ethical
concerns if researchers decide to conduct an online experiment without
explicitly notifying social media users about their intent. There is a need for
more controlled and scalable mechanisms to evaluate the impacts of digital
discussion interventions on audiences. We introduce the Public Discourse
Sandbox (PDS), which serves as a digital discourse research platform for
human-AI as well as AI-AI discourse research, testing, and training. PDS
provides a safe and secure space for research experiments that are not viable
on public, commercial social media platforms. Its main purpose is to enable the
understanding of AI behaviors and the impacts of customized AI participants via
techniques such as prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
and fine-tuning. We provide a hosted live version of the sandbox to support
researchers as well as the open-sourced code on GitHub for community
collaboration and contribution.

Conclusion: 扩展AI伦理框架，纳入代际环境正义，全面考虑生成式AI系统的生命周期影响。

Abstract: As generative AI systems become widely adopted, they enable unprecedented
creation levels of synthetic data across text, images, audio, and video
modalities. While research has addressed the energy consumption of model
training and inference, a critical sustainability challenge remains
understudied: digital waste. This term refers to stored data that consumes
resources without serving a specific (and/or immediate) purpose. This paper
presents this terminology in the AI context and introduces digital waste as an
ethical imperative within (generative) AI development, positioning
environmental sustainability as core for responsible innovation. Drawing from
established digital resource management approaches, we examine how other
disciplines manage digital waste and identify transferable approaches for the
AI community. We propose specific recommendations encompassing re-search
directions, technical interventions, and cultural shifts to mitigate the
environmental consequences of in-definite data storage. By expanding AI ethics
beyond immediate concerns like bias and privacy to include inter-generational
environmental justice, this work contributes to a more comprehensive ethical
framework that considers the complete lifecycle impact of generative AI
systems.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究探讨大型语言模型（LLM）对历史叙事传播的影响，特别是对大规模暴行记忆的表述。通过比较五种LLM在四个历史案例中的表现，发现模型对未被充分记录的事件易受否认主义影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLM如何影响历史记忆的传播，尤其是其可能导致的记忆扭曲或否认（“假体否认”）。

Method: 对五种LLM（Claude、GPT、Llama、Mixtral、Gemini）进行对比审计，测试其在四个历史案例（Holodomor、大屠杀、柬埔寨种族灭绝、卢旺达种族灭绝）中对否认主义观点的反应。

Result: LLM对广泛记录的事件（如大屠杀）回答准确，但对未被充分记录的事件（如柬埔寨种族灭绝）易出现不一致和否认主义倾向。

Conclusion: LLM虽扩展了假体记忆的概念，但未受监管的使用可能强化历史否认主义，对数字记忆保存提出伦理挑战。

Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) can influence how
historical narratives are disseminated and perceived. This study explores the
implications of LLMs' responses on the representation of mass atrocity memory,
examining whether generative AI systems contribute to prosthetic memory, i.e.,
mediated experiences of historical events, or to what we term "prosthetic
denial," the AI-mediated erasure or distortion of atrocity memories. We argue
that LLMs function as interfaces that can elicit prosthetic memories and,
therefore, act as experiential sites for memory transmission, but also
introduce risks of denialism, particularly when their outputs align with
contested or revisionist narratives. To empirically assess these risks, we
conducted a comparative audit of five LLMs (Claude, GPT, Llama, Mixtral, and
Gemini) across four historical case studies: the Holodomor, the Holocaust, the
Cambodian Genocide, and the genocide against the Tutsis in Rwanda. Each model
was prompted with questions addressing common denialist claims in English and
an alternative language relevant to each case (Ukrainian, German, Khmer, and
French). Our findings reveal that while LLMs generally produce accurate
responses for widely documented events like the Holocaust, significant
inconsistencies and susceptibility to denialist framings are observed for more
underrepresented cases like the Cambodian Genocide. The disparities highlight
the influence of training data availability and the probabilistic nature of LLM
responses on memory integrity. We conclude that while LLMs extend the concept
of prosthetic memory, their unmoderated use risks reinforcing historical
denialism, raising ethical concerns for (digital) memory preservation, and
potentially challenging the advantageous role of technology associated with the
original values of prosthetic memory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于有限原材料的持续需求和短期碳减排解决方案的缺乏，实现净零目标极具挑战性。循环经济（CE）被视为解决方案。

Method: 通过热力学材料网络的形式化，将DRL集成到材料循环性设计中，并基于Stable-Baselines3库开发。

Result: CiRL库具有循环性导向的环境，采用状态空间形式，并在Google Colaboratory中开发，便于跨学科研究。

Conclusion: CiRL为循环经济研究提供了一个公开可用的工具，支持跨学科合作。

Abstract: The demand of finite raw materials will keep increasing as they fuel modern
society. Simultaneously, solutions for stopping carbon emissions in the short
term are not available, thus making the net zero target extremely challenging
to achieve at scale. The circular economy (CE) paradigm is gaining attention as
a solution to address climate change and the uncertainties of supplies of
critical materials. Hence, in this paper, we introduce CiRL, a deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) library of environments focused on the circularity
of both solid and fluid materials. The integration of DRL into the design of
material circularity is possible thanks to the formalism of thermodynamical
material networks, which is underpinned by compartmental dynamical
thermodynamics. Along with the focus on circularity, this library has three
more features: the new CE-oriented environments are in the state-space form,
which is typically used in dynamical systems analysis and control designs; it
is based on a state-of-the-art Python library of DRL algorithms, namely,
Stable-Baselines3; and it is developed in Google Colaboratory to be accessible
to researchers from different disciplines and backgrounds as is often the case
for circular economy researchers and engineers. CiRL is publicly available.

Motivation: AI编程助手的普及对编程教育的评估方式、学术诚信和技能发展提出了挑战，需要寻找替代传统评分的方法。

Method: 研究采用基于量表的匿名同行评审，学生互评2D游戏项目，并与教师评分进行相关性、平均绝对误差和均方根误差比较。47个团队完成反思调查。

Result: 同行评审能适度准确地近似教师评分，同时提升学生参与度、评估思维和提供反馈的兴趣。

Conclusion: 研究为设计可扩展、可信赖的同行评估系统提供了依据，以应对AI辅助编程时代的挑战。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of AI powered coding assistants like ChatGPT and other
coding copilots is transforming programming education, raising questions about
assessment practices, academic integrity, and skill development. As educators
seek alternatives to traditional grading methods susceptible to AI enabled
plagiarism, structured peer assessment could be a promising strategy. This
paper presents an empirical study of a rubric based, anonymized peer review
process implemented in a large introductory programming course.
  Students evaluated each other's final projects (2D game), and their
assessments were compared to instructor grades using correlation, mean absolute
error, and root mean square error (RMSE). Additionally, reflective surveys from
47 teams captured student perceptions of fairness, grading behavior, and
preferences regarding grade aggregation. Results show that peer review can
approximate instructor evaluation with moderate accuracy and foster student
engagement, evaluative thinking, and interest in providing good feedback to
their peers. We discuss these findings for designing scalable, trustworthy peer
assessment systems to face the age of AI assisted coding.

Result: 中国缩略图更随意，美国缩略图更正式、色彩更饱和、细节更精细等。

Conclusion: 差异反映文化偏好，方法可作为视觉宣传分析的基准。

Abstract: We propose a two-step approach for detecting differences in the style of
images across sources of differing cultural affinity, where images are first
clustered into finer visual themes based on content before their aesthetic
features are compared. We test this approach on 2,400 YouTube video thumbnails
taken equally from two U.S. and two Chinese YouTube channels, and relating
equally to COVID-19 and the Ukraine conflict. Our results suggest that while
Chinese thumbnails are less formal and more candid, U.S. channels tend to use
more deliberate, proper photographs as thumbnails. In particular, U.S.
thumbnails are less colorful, more saturated, darker, more finely detailed,
less symmetric, sparser, less varied, and more up close and personal than
Chinese thumbnails. We suggest that most of these differences reflect cultural
preferences, and that our methods and observations can serve as a baseline
against which suspected visual propaganda can be computed and compared.

Conclusion: 论文主张开发跟踪工具以监测AI许可证的采用和遵守情况，确保其实现负责任使用的目标。

Abstract: Foundation models have had a transformative impact on AI. A combination of
large investments in research and development, growing sources of digital data
for training, and architectures that scale with data and compute has led to
models with powerful capabilities. Releasing assets is fundamental to
scientific advancement and commercial enterprise. However, concerns over
negligent or malicious uses of AI have led to the design of mechanisms to limit
the risks of the technology. The result has been a proliferation of licenses
with behavioral-use clauses and acceptable-use-policies that are increasingly
being adopted by commonly used families of models (Llama, Gemma, Deepseek) and
a myriad of smaller projects. We created and deployed a custom AI licenses
generator to facilitate license creation and have quantitatively and
qualitatively analyzed over 300 customized licenses created with this tool.
Alongside this we analyzed 1.7 million models licenses on the HuggingFace model
hub. Our results show increasing adoption of these licenses, interest in tools
that support their creation and a convergence on common clause configurations.
In this paper we take the position that tools for tracking adoption of, and
adherence to, these licenses is the natural next step and urgently needed in
order to ensure they have the desired impact of ensuring responsible use.

Conclusion: 性别分层方法在衰老研究中至关重要，并为个性化干预提供了潜在遗传靶点。

Abstract: Brain aging trajectories differ between males and females, yet the genetic
factors underlying these differences remain underexplored. Using structural MRI
and genotyping data from 40,940 UK Biobank participants (aged 45-83), we
computed Brain Age Gap Estimates (BrainAGE) for total brain, hippocampal, and
ventricular volumes. We conducted sex-stratified genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) and Post-GWAS analyses to identify genetic variants associated
with accelerated brain aging. Distinct gene sets emerged by sex: in females,
neurotransmitter transport and mitochondrial stress response genes were
implicated; in males, immune and inflammation-related genes dominated. Shared
genes, including GMNC and OSTN, were consistently linked to brain volumes
across sexes, suggesting core roles in neurostructural maintenance. Tissue
expression analyses revealed sex-specific enrichment in pathways tied to
neurodegeneration. These findings highlight the importance of sex-stratified
approaches in aging research and suggest genetic targets for personalized
interventions against age-related cognitive decline.

Motivation: 现代多处理器芯片需要精确的功耗估计，但现有方法ABPI在实际硬件中表现不佳。

Method: 提出CPINN-ABPI方法，结合物理模型与数据驱动学习，并通过多目标遗传算法优化。

Result: CPINN-ABPI显著降低了MAE和WMAPE，同时保持实时性能。

Conclusion: 新方法在功耗估计中表现出色，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient thermal and power management in modern multiprocessor
systems-on-chip (MPSoCs) demands accurate power consumption estimation. One of
the state-of-the-art approaches, Alternative Blind Power Identification (ABPI),
theoretically eliminates the dependence on steady-state temperatures,
addressing a major shortcoming of previous approaches. However, ABPI
performance has remained unverified in actual hardware implementations. In this
study, we conduct the first empirical validation of ABPI on commercial hardware
using the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier AGX platform. Our findings reveal that, while
ABPI provides computational efficiency and independence from steady-state
temperature, it exhibits considerable accuracy deficiencies in real-world
scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel approach that
integrates Custom Physics-Informed Neural Networks (CPINNs) with the underlying
thermal model of ABPI. Our approach employs a specialized loss function that
harmonizes physical principles with data-driven learning, complemented by
multi-objective genetic algorithm optimization to balance estimation accuracy
and computational cost. In experimental validation, CPINN-ABPI achieves a
reduction of 84.7\% CPU and 73.9\% GPU in the mean absolute error (MAE)
relative to ABPI, with the weighted mean absolute percentage error (WMAPE)
improving from 47\%--81\% to $\sim$12\%. The method maintains real-time
performance with 195.3~$\mu$s of inference time, with similar 85\%--99\%
accuracy gains across heterogeneous SoCs.

Abstract: Network models have been widely used to study diverse systems and analyze
their dynamic behaviors. Given the structural variability of networks, an
intriguing question arises: Can we infer the type of system represented by a
network based on its structure? This classification problem involves extracting
relevant features from the network. Existing literature has proposed various
methods that combine structural measurements and dynamical processes for
feature extraction. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to

### [523] [Fluent but Culturally Distant: Can Regional Training Teach Cultural Understanding?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21548)
*Dhruv Agarwal,Anya Shukla,Sunayana Sitaram,Aditya Vashistha*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: 研究发现，印度本地化的大语言模型（LLMs）在文化价值观和实践上与印度文化并不比全球模型更一致，甚至不如普通美国人更能代表印度文化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估本地化LLMs是否真正反映当地文化，而不仅仅是语言。

Method: 通过四个任务（价值观和实践）评估五个印度本地和五个全球LLMs。

Result: 印度本地模型在文化一致性上表现不佳，提示策略和区域微调均无效。

Conclusion: 需更多高质量、文化相关数据以构建真正本地化的LLMs。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are used around the world but exhibit Western
cultural tendencies. To address this cultural misalignment, many countries have
begun developing "regional" LLMs tailored to local communities. Yet it remains
unclear whether these models merely speak the language of their users or also
reflect their cultural values and practices. Using India as a case study, we
evaluate five Indic and five global LLMs along two key dimensions: values (via
the Inglehart-Welzel map and GlobalOpinionQA) and practices (via CulturalBench
and NormAd). Across all four tasks, we find that Indic models do not align more
closely with Indian cultural norms than global models. In fact, an average
American person is a better proxy for Indian cultural values than any Indic
model. Even prompting strategies fail to meaningfully improve alignment.
Ablations show that regional fine-tuning does not enhance cultural competence
and may in fact hurt it by impeding recall of existing knowledge. We trace this
failure to the scarcity of high-quality, untranslated, and culturally grounded
pretraining and fine-tuning data. Our study positions cultural evaluation as a
first-class requirement alongside multilingual benchmarks and offers a reusable
methodology for developers. We call for deeper investments in culturally
representative data to build and evaluate truly sovereign LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文研究了印欧语系中印地语、古吉拉特语和孟加拉语等语言的数字系统，发现其1-99的数字形式高度不透明且无法通过简单规则构建。通过跨语言数据，作者量化了数字系统的复杂性，并探讨了导致这种复杂性的语言和非语言因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印欧语系语言的数字系统与其他语言（如英语、汉语）不同，其1-99的数字形式高度不透明且无法通过简单规则构建。作者希望通过研究这些语言的数字系统，揭示其复杂性背后的原因及其在跨语言类型学中的地位。

Method: 使用跨语言数据库的数据，开发并应用了量化数字系统复杂性的指标，比较了印欧语系语言与世界其他语言的复杂性差异，并探讨了宗教、地理隔离等因素对复杂性的影响。

Result: 研究发现印欧语系语言的数字系统复杂性显著高于世界其他语言，且不同印欧语系语言之间的复杂性也存在差异。尽管复杂性高，这些系统仍遵循跨语言中高效沟通的一般原则。

Conclusion: 作者呼吁在研究跨语言数字系统时，应重视这种被忽视的复杂性维度，并探讨了复杂数字系统在印欧语系语言中持续存在的原因。

Abstract: The numeral systems of Indo-Aryan languages such as Hindi, Gujarati, and
Bengali are highly unusual in that unlike most numeral systems (e.g., those of
English, Chinese, etc.), forms referring to 1--99 are highly non-transparent
and are cannot be constructed using straightforward rules. As an example,
Hindi/Urdu *iky\=anve* `91' is not decomposable into the composite elements
*ek* `one' and *nave* `ninety' in the way that its English counterpart is. This
paper situates Indo-Aryan languages within the typology of cross-linguistic
numeral systems, and explores the linguistic and non-linguistic factors that
may be responsible for the persistence of complex systems in these languages.
Using cross-linguistic data from multiple databases, we develop and employ a
number of cross-linguistically applicable metrics to quantifies the complexity
of languages' numeral systems, and demonstrate that Indo-Aryan languages have
decisively more complex numeral systems than the world's languages as a whole,
though individual Indo-Aryan languages differ from each other in terms of the
complexity of the patterns they display. We investigate the factors (e.g.,
religion, geographic isolation, etc.) that underlie complexity in numeral
systems, with a focus on South Asia, in an attempt to develop an account of why
complex numeral systems developed and persisted in certain Indo-Aryan languages
but not elsewhere. Finally, we demonstrate that Indo-Aryan numeral systems
adhere to certain general pressures toward efficient communication found
cross-linguistically, despite their high complexity. We call for this somewhat
overlooked dimension of complexity to be taken seriously when discussing
general variation in cross-linguistic numeral systems.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的运行成本高，按令牌计价的机制可能导致服务提供商虚报令牌数量以多收费，而用户无法验证。

Result: 实验证明按令牌计价易被滥用，而按字符计价能消除激励问题。

Conclusion: 按字符计价是一种更公平且激励兼容的定价机制。

Abstract: State-of-the-art large language models require specialized hardware and
substantial energy to operate. As a consequence, cloud-based services that
provide access to large language models have become very popular. In these
services, the price users pay for an output provided by a model depends on the
number of tokens the model uses to generate it -- they pay a fixed price per
token. In this work, we show that this pricing mechanism creates a financial
incentive for providers to strategize and misreport the (number of) tokens a
model used to generate an output, and users cannot prove, or even know, whether
a provider is overcharging them. However, we also show that, if an unfaithful
provider is obliged to be transparent about the generative process used by the
model, misreporting optimally without raising suspicion is hard. Nevertheless,
as a proof-of-concept, we introduce an efficient heuristic algorithm that
allows providers to significantly overcharge users without raising suspicion,
highlighting the vulnerability of users under the current pay-per-token pricing
mechanism. Further, to completely eliminate the financial incentive to
strategize, we introduce a simple incentive-compatible token pricing mechanism.
Under this mechanism, the price users pay for an output provided by a model
depends on the number of characters of the output -- they pay a fixed price per
character. Along the way, to illustrate and complement our theoretical results,
we conduct experiments with several large language models from the
$\texttt{Llama}$, $\texttt{Gemma}$ and $\texttt{Ministral}$ families, and input
prompts from the LMSYS Chatbot Arena platform.

Motivation: 在线公平分配中，无限制的估值函数导致强不可能性结果，因此研究受限估值函数实例以绕过限制。

Method: 提出确定性算法，维护优先级系统，并设计基于匹配的算法利用未来信息实现EF1和EF2分配。

Result: 算法在每一步维持1/(2n-1)-MMS分配，最终达到1/4-MMS分配；利用未来信息可实现EF1和EF2分配。

Conclusion: 受限估值函数实例下，算法可实现公平分配，未来信息可进一步优化结果。

Abstract: We study an online fair division setting, where goods arrive one at a time
and there is a fixed set of $n$ agents, each of whom has an additive valuation
function over the goods. Once a good appears, the value each agent has for it
is revealed and it must be allocated immediately and irrevocably to one of the
agents. It is known that without any assumptions about the values being
severely restricted or coming from a distribution, very strong impossibility
results hold in this setting. To bypass the latter, we turn our attention to
instances where the valuation functions are restricted. In particular, we study
personalized $2$-value instances, where there are only two possible values each
agent may have for each good, possibly different across agents, and we show how
to obtain worst case guarantees with respect to well-known fairness notions,
such as maximin share fairness and envy-freeness up to one (or two) good(s). We
suggest a deterministic algorithm that maintains a $1/(2n-1)$-MMS allocation at
every time step and show that this is the best possible any deterministic
algorithm can achieve if one cares about every single time step; nevertheless,
eventually the allocation constructed by our algorithm becomes a $1/4$-MMS
allocation. To achieve this, the algorithm implicitly maintains a fragile
system of priority levels for all agents. Further, we show that, by allowing
some limited access to future information, it is possible to have stronger
results with less involved approaches. By knowing the values of goods for $n-1$
time steps into the future, we design a matching-based algorithm that achieves
an EF$1$ allocation every $n$ time steps, while always maintaining an EF$2$
allocation. Finally, we show that our results allow us to get the first
nontrivial guarantees for additive instances in which the ratio of the maximum
over the minimum value an agent has for a good is bounded.

Motivation: 探索如何在时间投票中超越现有的扩展合理性代表（EJR）概念，引入更严格的比例代表制公理。

Method: 提出并分析了更强的JR、PJR和EJR变体，以及时间适应的多赢家公理（如EJR+、FJR等），研究其存在性和关系。

Result: 建立了丰富的比例代表制概念层次，证明EJR+和FJR在满足EJR的同时仍适用于所有时间选举。

Conclusion: 论文扩展了时间投票中的比例代表制理论，提出了更严格且可行的公理，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: We study proportional representation in the framework of temporal voting with
approval ballots. Prior work adapted basic proportional representation concepts
-- justified representation (JR), proportional JR (PJR), and extended JR (EJR)
-- from the multiwinner setting to the temporal setting. Our work introduces
and examines ways of going beyond EJR. Specifically, we consider stronger
variants of JR, PJR, and EJR, and introduce temporal adaptations of more
demanding multiwinner axioms, such as EJR+, full JR (FJR), full proportional JR
(FPJR), and the Core. For each of these concepts, we investigate its existence
and study its relationship to existing notions, thereby establishing a rich
hierarchy of proportionality concepts. Notably, we show that two of our
proposed axioms -- EJR+ and FJR -- strengthen EJR while remaining satisfiable
in every temporal election.

Method: 引入帕累托最优自注意力，将跨域学习建模为多目标问题，优化推荐任务并最小化跨域注意力分数。

Result: AutoCDSR显著提升了SASRec和Bert4Rec的性能，Recall@10和NDCG@10分别提高了9.8%、16.0%和12.0%、16.7%。

Conclusion: AutoCDSR是一种灵活且高效的插件模块，无需额外计算开销即可提升现有推荐系统性能。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation is a popular paradigm in modern recommender
systems. In particular, one challenging problem in this space is cross-domain
sequential recommendation (CDSR), which aims to predict future behaviors given
user interactions across multiple domains. Existing CDSR frameworks are mostly
built on the self-attention transformer and seek to improve by explicitly
injecting additional domain-specific components (e.g. domain-aware module
blocks). While these additional components help, we argue they overlook the
core self-attention module already present in the transformer, a naturally
powerful tool to learn correlations among behaviors. In this work, we aim to
improve the CDSR performance for simple models from a novel perspective of
enhancing the self-attention. Specifically, we introduce a Pareto-optimal
self-attention and formulate the cross-domain learning as a multi-objective
problem, where we optimize the recommendation task while dynamically minimizing
the cross-domain attention scores. Our approach automates knowledge transfer in
CDSR (dubbed as AutoCDSR) -- it not only mitigates negative transfer but also
encourages complementary knowledge exchange among auxiliary domains. Based on
the idea, we further introduce AutoCDSR+, a more performant variant with slight
additional cost. Our proposal is easy to implement and works as a plug-and-play
module that can be incorporated into existing transformer-based recommenders.
Besides flexibility, it is practical to deploy because it brings little extra
computational overheads without heavy hyper-parameter tuning. AutoCDSR on
average improves Recall@10 for SASRec and Bert4Rec by 9.8% and 16.0% and
NDCG@10 by 12.0% and 16.7%, respectively. Code is available at
https://github.com/snap-research/AutoCDSR.

TL;DR: SemRank结合LLM引导的查询理解和基于概念的语义索引，显著提升科学论文检索的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集检索方法难以捕捉细粒度科学概念，而基于LLM的方法缺乏语料库特定知识的支持，可能生成不可靠内容。

Method: 提出SemRank框架，通过多粒度科学概念索引论文，并利用LLM识别查询核心概念以实现精确语义匹配。

Result: 实验表明SemRank显著提升检索性能，优于现有LLM基线，且保持高效。

Conclusion: SemRank为科学论文检索提供了一种高效且准确的新方法。

Abstract: Scientific paper retrieval is essential for supporting literature discovery
and research. While dense retrieval methods demonstrate effectiveness in
general-purpose tasks, they often fail to capture fine-grained scientific
concepts that are essential for accurate understanding of scientific queries.
Recent studies also use large language models (LLMs) for query understanding;
however, these methods often lack grounding in corpus-specific knowledge and
may generate unreliable or unfaithful content. To overcome these limitations,
we propose SemRank, an effective and efficient paper retrieval framework that
combines LLM-guided query understanding with a concept-based semantic index.
Each paper is indexed using multi-granular scientific concepts, including
general research topics and detailed key phrases. At query time, an LLM
identifies core concepts derived from the corpus to explicitly capture the
query's information need. These identified concepts enable precise semantic
matching, significantly enhancing retrieval accuracy. Experiments show that
SemRank consistently improves the performance of various base retrievers,
surpasses strong existing LLM-based baselines, and remains highly efficient.

Conclusion: Yambda-5B的发布旨在推动推荐系统研究，提供可访问的资源以促进创新和可重复性。

Abstract: We present Yambda-5B, a large-scale open dataset sourced from the
Yandex.Music streaming platform. Yambda-5B contains 4.79 billion user-item
interactions from 1 million users across 9.39 million tracks. The dataset
includes two primary types of interactions: implicit feedback (listening
events) and explicit feedback (likes, dislikes, unlikes and undislikes). In
addition, we provide audio embeddings for most tracks, generated by a
convolutional neural network trained on audio spectrograms. A key
distinguishing feature of Yambda-5B is the inclusion of the is_organic flag,
which separates organic user actions from recommendation-driven events. This
distinction is critical for developing and evaluating machine learning
algorithms, as Yandex.Music relies on recommender systems to personalize track
selection for users. To support rigorous benchmarking, we introduce an
evaluation protocol based on a Global Temporal Split, allowing recommendation
algorithms to be assessed in conditions that closely mirror real-world use. We
report benchmark results for standard baselines (ItemKNN, iALS) and advanced
models (SANSA, SASRec) using a variety of evaluation metrics. By releasing
Yambda-5B to the community, we aim to provide a readily accessible,
industrial-scale resource to advance research, foster innovation, and promote

Motivation: 传统方法假设用户到达是静态的，不适用于动态环境，需要一种新框架来应对分布变化。

Method: 提出UDuo框架，包括动态用户到达表示、自适应资源分配策略和在线时间序列预测。

Result: 实验表明UDuo在效率和收敛速度上优于传统方法，且理论保证可行。

Conclusion: UDuo为动态环境中的在线资源分配提供了高效且理论可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Online resource allocation under budget constraints critically depends on
proper modeling of user arrival dynamics. Classical approaches employ
stochastic user arrival models to derive near-optimal solutions through
fractional matching formulations of exposed users for downstream allocation
tasks. However, this is no longer a reasonable assumption when the environment
changes dynamically. In this work, We propose the Universal Dual optimization
framework UDuo, a novel paradigm that fundamentally rethinks online allocation
through three key innovations: (i) a temporal user arrival representation
vector that explicitly captures distribution shifts in user arrival patterns
and resource consumption dynamics, (ii) a resource pacing learner with adaptive
allocation policies that generalize to heterogeneous constraint scenarios, and
(iii) an online time-series forecasting approach for future user arrival
distributions that achieves asymptotically optimal solutions with constraint
feasibility guarantees in dynamic environments. Experimental results show that
UDuo achieves higher efficiency and faster convergence than the traditional
stochastic arrival model in real-world pricing while maintaining rigorous
theoretical validity for general online allocation problems.

Motivation: 现代基于GNN的推荐系统需要满足用户隐私和法规要求，能够选择性遗忘训练数据，但传统方法存在性能下降或假设不成立的问题。

Method: 提出了一种模型无关的预训练范式UnlearnRec，通过Influence Encoder直接生成更新后的模型参数，减少微调需求。

Result: 在公开基准测试中，该方法表现出卓越的遗忘效果，并提供超过10倍的加速。

Conclusion: UnlearnRec为推荐系统提供了一种高效且性能保持的选择性遗忘解决方案。

Abstract: Modern recommender systems powered by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at
modeling complex user-item interactions, yet increasingly face scenarios
requiring selective forgetting of training data. Beyond user requests to remove
specific interactions due to privacy concerns or preference changes, regulatory
frameworks mandate recommender systems' ability to eliminate the influence of
certain user data from models. This recommendation unlearning challenge
presents unique difficulties as removing connections within interaction graphs
creates ripple effects throughout the model, potentially impacting
recommendations for numerous users. Traditional approaches suffer from
significant drawbacks: fragmentation methods damage graph structure and
diminish performance, while influence function techniques make assumptions that
may not hold in complex GNNs, particularly with self-supervised or random
architectures. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model-agnostic
pre-training paradigm UnlearnRec that prepares systems for efficient unlearning
operations. Our Influence Encoder takes unlearning requests together with
existing model parameters and directly produces updated parameters of unlearned
model with little fine-tuning, avoiding complete retraining while preserving
model performance characteristics. Extensive evaluation on public benchmarks
demonstrates that our method delivers exceptional unlearning effectiveness
while providing more than 10x speedup compared to retraining approaches. We
release our method implementation at: https://github.com/HKUDS/UnlearnRec.

Conclusion: 预训练模型能高效、稳健地分类EEG数据，减少资源需求并提高适用性。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is commonly used by physicians for the diagnosis
of numerous neurological disorders. Due to the large volume of EEGs requiring
interpretation and the specific expertise involved, artificial
intelligence-based tools are being developed to assist in their visual
analysis. In this paper, we compare two deep learning models (CNN-LSTM and
Transformer-based) with BioSerenity-E1, a recently proposed foundation model,
in the task of classifying entire EEG recordings as normal or abnormal. The
three models were trained or finetuned on 2,500 EEG recordings and their
performances were evaluated on two private and one public datasets: a large
multicenter dataset annotated by a single specialist (dataset A composed of n =
4,480 recordings), a small multicenter dataset annotated by three specialists
(dataset B, n = 198), and the Temple University Abnormal (TUAB) EEG corpus
evaluation dataset (n = 276). On dataset A, the three models achieved at least
86% balanced accuracy, with BioSerenity-E1 finetuned achieving the highest
balanced accuracy (89.19% [88.36-90.41]). BioSerenity-E1 finetuned also
achieved the best performance on dataset B, with 94.63% [92.32-98.12] balanced
accuracy. The models were then validated on TUAB evaluation dataset, whose
corresponding training set was not used during training, where they achieved at
least 76% accuracy. Specifically, BioSerenity-E1 finetuned outperformed the
other two models, reaching an accuracy of 82.25% [78.27-87.48]. Our results
highlight the usefulness of leveraging pre-trained models for automatic EEG
classification: enabling robust and efficient interpretation of EEG data with
fewer resources and broader applicability.

results as well as multiple exact algorithms that scale well as the input grows
(FPT), which could prove useful in practice.
  Our main contribution is an algorithm that deals efficiently with tree-like
structures (bounded \emph{treewidth}) for ``small'' teams. We complement this
result by proving that our algorithm is asymptotically optimal. Particularly,
there can be no algorithm that vastly outperforms the one we present, under
reasonable theoretical assumptions, even when considering star-like structures
(bounded \emph{vertex cover number}).

### [537] [Conformance Checking for Less: Efficient Conformance Checking for Long Event Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21506)
*Eli Bogdanov,Izack Cohen,Avigdor Gal*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: ConLES是一种滑动窗口一致性检查方法，用于处理长事件序列，通过分区和迭代对齐显著减少搜索空间，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长事件序列和大数据日志的普遍性使得一致性检查计算不可行，需要一种可扩展的方法。

Method: ConLES将轨迹分区为子轨迹，迭代对齐每个子轨迹，利用全局信息优化对齐决策。

Result: ConLES在多个数据集上表现优于现有算法，显著减少搜索空间并高效扩展。

Conclusion: ConLES是处理长事件序列一致性检查的可行且领先方案。

Abstract: Long event sequences (termed traces) and large data logs that originate from
sensors and prediction models are becoming increasingly common in our data-rich
world. In such scenarios, conformance checking-validating a data log against an
expected system behavior (the process model) can become computationally
infeasible due to the exponential complexity of finding an optimal alignment.
To alleviate scalability challenges for this task, we propose ConLES, a
sliding-window conformance checking approach for long event sequences that
preserves the interpretability of alignment-based methods. ConLES partitions
traces into manageable subtraces and iteratively aligns each against the
expected behavior, leading to significant reduction of the search space while
maintaining overall accuracy. We use global information that captures
structural properties of both the trace and the process model, enabling
informed alignment decisions and discarding unpromising alignments, even if
they appear locally optimal. Performance evaluations across multiple datasets
highlight that ConLES outperforms the leading optimal and heuristic algorithms
for long traces, consistently achieving the optimal or near-optimal solution.
Unlike other conformance methods that struggle with long event sequences,
ConLES significantly reduces the search space, scales efficiently, and uniquely
supports both predefined and discovered process models, making it a viable and
leading option for conformance checking of long event sequences.

*Dawei Feng,Di Mei,Huiri Tan,Lei Ren,Xianying Lou,Zhangxi Tan*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: StreamLink是一个基于大语言模型（LLM）的分布式数据系统，旨在提升数据工程任务的效率和可访问性，同时注重用户数据隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过结合LLM和分布式数据处理，解决数据工程中的自然语言查询和SQL生成问题，同时确保隐私和安全性。

Method: 在Apache Spark和Hadoop等分布式框架上构建StreamLink，利用本地微调的LLM处理自然语言查询，并生成SQL。系统还包含基于LLM的语法和安全检查器。

Result: SQL生成执行准确率比基线方法提高10%，能在几秒内从数亿条数据中检索用户所需信息。

Conclusion: StreamLink展示了LLM与分布式数据处理结合的潜力，为用户提供了高效、安全且易用的数据交互方式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in natural
language understanding (NLU), opening doors for innovative applications. We
introduce StreamLink - an LLM-driven distributed data system designed to
improve the efficiency and accessibility of data engineering tasks. We build
StreamLink on top of distributed frameworks such as Apache Spark and Hadoop to
handle large data at scale. One of the important design philosophies of
StreamLink is to respect user data privacy by utilizing local fine-tuned LLMs
instead of a public AI service like ChatGPT. With help from domain-adapted
LLMs, we can improve our system's understanding of natural language queries
from users in various scenarios and simplify the procedure of generating
database queries like the Structured Query Language (SQL) for information
processing. We also incorporate LLM-based syntax and security checkers to
guarantee the reliability and safety of each generated query. StreamLink
illustrates the potential of merging generative LLMs with distributed data
processing for comprehensive and user-centric data engineering. With this
architecture, we allow users to interact with complex database systems at
different scales in a user-friendly and security-ensured manner, where the SQL
generation reaches over 10\% of execution accuracy compared to baseline
methods, and allow users to find the most concerned item from hundreds of
millions of items within a few seconds using natural language.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有学术平台（如PapersWithCode）在数据集管理中的低效手动流程问题。

Result: 在数据集提取和实体解析任务中，ChatPD表现优于PapersWithCode，精度和召回率约90%。

Conclusion: ChatPD成功部署并提供数据集发现服务，代码和网络已开源。

Abstract: Scientific research heavily depends on suitable datasets for method
validation, but existing academic platforms with dataset management like
PapersWithCode suffer from inefficiencies in their manual workflow. To overcome
this bottleneck, we present a system, called ChatPD, that utilizes Large
Language Models (LLMs) to automate dataset information extraction from academic
papers and construct a structured paper-dataset network. Our system consists of
three key modules: \textit{paper collection}, \textit{dataset information
extraction}, and \textit{dataset entity resolution} to construct paper-dataset
networks. Specifically, we propose a \textit{Graph Completion and Inference}
strategy to map dataset descriptions to their corresponding entities. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ChatPD not only outperforms the
existing platform PapersWithCode in dataset usage extraction but also achieves
about 90\% precision and recall in entity resolution tasks. Moreover, we have
deployed ChatPD to continuously extract which datasets are used in papers, and
provide a dataset discovery service, such as task-specific dataset queries and
similar dataset recommendations. We open source ChatPD and the current
paper-dataset network on this [GitHub
repository]{https://github.com/ChatPD-web/ChatPD}.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架难以有效利用GitHub上的开源仓库资源，主要问题包括信息过载和依赖关系复杂，且受限于LLM的有限上下文窗口。

Method: RepoMaster通过构建功能调用图、模块依赖图和分层代码树，识别核心组件，并逐步探索和修剪信息以优化上下文使用。

Result: 在MLE-bench上，RepoMaster的有效提交率比最强基线OpenHands提升了110%；在GitTaskBench上，任务通过率从24.1%提升至62.9%，同时减少了95%的token使用。

Conclusion: RepoMaster通过高效利用GitHub仓库资源，显著提升了复杂任务的解决能力，为代码代理的未来发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: The ultimate goal of code agents is to solve complex tasks autonomously.
Although large language models (LLMs) have made substantial progress in code
generation, real-world tasks typically demand full-fledged code repositories
rather than simple scripts. Building such repositories from scratch remains a
major challenge. Fortunately, GitHub hosts a vast, evolving collection of
open-source repositories, which developers frequently reuse as modular
components for complex tasks. Yet, existing frameworks like OpenHands and
SWE-Agent still struggle to effectively leverage these valuable resources.
Relying solely on README files provides insufficient guidance, and deeper
exploration reveals two core obstacles: overwhelming information and tangled
dependencies of repositories, both constrained by the limited context windows
of current LLMs. To tackle these issues, we propose RepoMaster, an autonomous
agent framework designed to explore and reuse GitHub repositories for solving
complex tasks. For efficient understanding, RepoMaster constructs function-call
graphs, module-dependency graphs, and hierarchical code trees to identify
essential components, providing only identified core elements to the LLMs
rather than the entire repository. During autonomous execution, it
progressively explores related components using our exploration tools and
prunes information to optimize context usage. Evaluated on the adjusted
MLE-bench, RepoMaster achieves a 110% relative boost in valid submissions over
the strongest baseline OpenHands. On our newly released GitTaskBench,
RepoMaster lifts the task-pass rate from 24.1% to 62.9% while reducing token
usage by 95%. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly available at
https://github.com/wanghuacan/RepoMaster.

combine CRISP-DM with XP in Data Science projects, providing a structured and
collaborative approach. Finally, the study generated improvement
recommendations for the company.

achieving a 21.11% solve rate overall. We expect GitGoodBench to serve as a
crucial stepping stone toward truly comprehensive SE agents that go beyond mere

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示语义与句法信息之间的同义关系，并利用这种关系重新分析感知图像压缩问题。

Method: 提出同义变分推理（SVI）方法，构建理想同义集（Synset），并通过最小化部分语义KL散度近似其后验分布。

Result: 理论证明感知图像压缩的优化方向遵循三重权衡，实验验证了SIC编解码器的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的分析方法有效，SIC编解码器在率失真感知性能上表现优异。

Abstract: Recent contributions of semantic information theory reveal the set-element
relationship between semantic and syntactic information, represented as
synonymous relationships. In this paper, we propose a synonymous variational
inference (SVI) method based on this synonymity viewpoint to re-analyze the
perceptual image compression problem. It takes perceptual similarity as a
typical synonymous criterion to build an ideal synonymous set (Synset), and
approximate the posterior of its latent synonymous representation with a
parametric density by minimizing a partial semantic KL divergence. This
analysis theoretically proves that the optimization direction of perception
image compression follows a triple tradeoff that can cover the existing
rate-distortion-perception schemes. Additionally, we introduce synonymous image
compression (SIC), a new image compression scheme that corresponds to the
analytical process of SVI, and implement a progressive SIC codec to fully
leverage the model's capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate comparable
rate-distortion-perception performance using a single progressive SIC codec,
thus verifying the effectiveness of our proposed analysis method.

Motivation: 探索如何利用量子特性提升生成AI性能，并解决现有量子算法在近量子设备上的扩展性问题。

Method: 提出两种方法：1）使用量子随机行走形式，结合量子与经典动力学；2）利用IBM量子硬件的固有噪声生成图像。

Result: 量子随机行走方法生成的MNIST图像FID更低；四量子比特硬件实验验证了噪声作为资源的可行性。

Conclusion: 本研究为量子生成AI的大规模算法开辟了新方向，展示了量子噪声作为资源的潜力。

Abstract: Quantum Diffusion Models (QDMs) are an emerging paradigm in Generative AI
that aims to use quantum properties to improve the performances of their
classical counterparts. However, existing algorithms are not easily scalable
due to the limitations of near-term quantum devices. Following our previous
work on QDMs, here we propose and implement two physics-inspired protocols. In
the first, we use the formalism of quantum stochastic walks, showing that a
specific interplay of quantum and classical dynamics in the forward process
produces statistically more robust models generating sets of MNIST images with
lower Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) than using totally classical dynamics.
In the second approach, we realize an algorithm to generate images by
exploiting the intrinsic noise of real IBM quantum hardware with only four
qubits. Our work could be a starting point to pave the way for new scenarios
for large-scale algorithms in quantum Generative AI, where quantum noise is
neither mitigated nor corrected, but instead exploited as a useful resource.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种非欧几里得神经量子态（NQS）变分方法，即双曲GRU，用于量子多体系统的变分蒙特卡洛模拟，并在多种模型中验证其性能优于传统欧几里得RNN/GRU。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索非欧几里得神经网络在量子多体系统中的应用潜力，尤其是针对具有层次结构的哈密顿量。

Method: 使用双曲GRU作为NQS变分方法，在横向场伊辛模型和一维海森堡模型中与欧几里得RNN/GRU进行性能对比。

Result: 双曲GRU在性能上达到或超过欧几里得RNN/GRU，尤其在具有层次结构的系统中表现更优。

Conclusion: 双曲GRU作为首个非欧几里得NQS变分方法具有潜力，未来可探索其他非欧几里得NQS类型。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum
state (NQS) ansatz, in the form of the hyperbolic GRU (a variant of recurrent
neural networks (RNNs)), to be used in the Variational Monte Carlo method of
approximating the ground state wavefunction for quantum many-body systems. In
particular, we examine the performances of NQS ansatzes constructed from both
conventional or Euclidean RNN/GRU and from hyperbolic GRU in the prototypical
settings of the one- and two-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIM)
of up to 100 spins and the one-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ and $J_1J_2J_3$
systems of up 50 spins. By virtue of the fact that, for all of the experiments
performed in this work, hyperbolic GRU can yield performances comparable to or
better than Euclidean RNNs, which have been extensively studied in these
settings in the literature, our work is a proof-of-concept for the viability of
hyperbolic GRU as the first type of non-Euclidean NQS ansatz for quantum
many-body systems. Furthermore, in settings where the Hamiltonian displays a
clear hierarchical interaction structure, such as the 1D Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ &
$J_1J_2J_3$ systems with the 1st, 2nd and even 3rd nearest neighbor
interactions, our results show that hyperbolic GRU definitively outperforms its
Euclidean version in all instances. The fact that these results are reminiscent
of the established ones from natural language processing where hyperbolic GRU
almost always outperforms Euclidean RNNs when the training data exhibit a
tree-like or hierarchical structure leads us to hypothesize that hyperbolic GRU
NQS ansatz would likely outperform Euclidean RNN/GRU NQS ansatz in quantum spin
systems that involve different degrees of nearest neighbor interactions.
Finally, with this work, we hope to initiate future studies of other types of
non-Euclidean NQS beyond hyperbolic GRU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在量子计算即将进入纠错时代的背景下，了解后NISQ算法（如HHL）对实际问题的适用性至关重要。

Method: 通过机器学习分类器（如多层感知机）对问题的数值属性进行分类，判断是否适合HHL算法实现。

Result: 研究表明，训练数据的分布对分类准确性至关重要，多层感知机可以实现准确分类。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计训练数据分布和分类器参数，可以准确判断问题是否适合HHL算法实现。

Abstract: Under the nearing error-corrected era of quantum computing, it is necessary
to understand the suitability of certain post-NISQ algorithms for practical
problems. One of the most promising, applicable and yet difficult to implement
in practical terms is the Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd (HHL) algorithm for linear
systems of equations. An enormous number of problems can be expressed as linear
systems of equations, from Machine Learning to fluid dynamics. However, in most
cases, HHL will not be able to provide a practical, reasonable solution to
these problems. This paper's goal inquires about whether problems can be
labeled using Machine Learning classifiers as suitable or unsuitable for HHL
implementation when some numerical information about the problem is known
beforehand. This work demonstrates that training on significantly
representative data distributions is critical to achieve good classifications
of the problems based on the numerical properties of the matrix representing
the system of equations. Accurate classification is possible through
Multi-Layer Perceptrons, although with careful design of the training data
distribution and classifier parameters.

Conclusion: 高斯过程回归量子算法的加速效果有限，需重新评估其实际应用价值。

Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression is a well-known machine learning technique for
which several quantum algorithms have been proposed. We show here that in a
wide range of scenarios these algorithms show no exponential speedup. We
achieve this by rigorously proving that the condition number of a kernel matrix
scales at least linearly with the matrix size under general assumptions on the
data and kernel. We additionally prove that the sparsity and Frobenius norm of
a kernel matrix scale linearly under similar assumptions. The implications for
the quantum algorithms runtime are independent of the complexity of loading
classical data on a quantum computer and also apply to dequantised algorithms.
We supplement our theoretical analysis with numerical verification for popular
kernels in machine learning.

Method: VoiceMark通过说话人特定潜在特征作为水印载体，结合VC模拟增强和基于VAD的损失函数，提升水印的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，VoiceMark在零样本VC合成后的水印检测准确率超过95%，远超现有方法的50%。

Conclusion: VoiceMark是首个针对零样本VC的水印方法，有效解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Voice cloning (VC)-resistant watermarking is an emerging technique for
tracing and preventing unauthorized cloning. Existing methods effectively trace
traditional VC models by training them on watermarked audio but fail in
zero-shot VC scenarios, where models synthesize audio from an audio prompt
without training. To address this, we propose VoiceMark, the first zero-shot
VC-resistant watermarking method that leverages speaker-specific latents as the
watermark carrier, allowing the watermark to transfer through the zero-shot VC
process into the synthesized audio. Additionally, we introduce VC-simulated
augmentations and VAD-based loss to enhance robustness against distortions.
Experiments on multiple zero-shot VC models demonstrate that VoiceMark achieves
over 95% accuracy in watermark detection after zero-shot VC synthesis,
significantly outperforming existing methods, which only reach around 50%. See

Motivation: 现有音乐源分离方法假设混合物是简单源信号之和，忽略了音乐制作中的信号退化（如均衡、压缩、混响等），导致与实际应用脱节。

Method: 提出MSR任务，将混合物建模为退化源信号的叠加，并开发RawStems数据集（包含578首歌曲的未处理源信号）和基线方法U-Former。

Result: 通过RawStems数据集和U-Former方法，验证了MSR任务的可行性。

Conclusion: MSR任务填补了音乐源分离与实际音乐制作的差距，RawStems数据集和U-Former方法为未来研究提供了基础。

Abstract: We introduce Music Source Restoration (MSR), a novel task addressing the gap
between idealized source separation and real-world music production. Current
Music Source Separation (MSS) approaches assume mixtures are simple sums of
sources, ignoring signal degradations employed during music production like
equalization, compression, and reverb. MSR models mixtures as degraded sums of
individually degraded sources, with the goal of recovering original, undegraded
signals. Due to the lack of data for MSR, we present RawStems, a dataset
annotation of 578 songs with unprocessed source signals organized into 8
primary and 17 secondary instrument groups, totaling 354.13 hours. To the best
of our knowledge, RawStems is the first dataset that contains unprocessed music
stems with hierarchical categories. We consider spectral filtering, dynamic
range compression, harmonic distortion, reverb and lossy codec as possible
degradations, and establish U-Former as a baseline method, demonstrating the
feasibility of MSR on our dataset. We release the RawStems dataset annotations,
degradation simulation pipeline, training code and pre-trained models to be
publicly available.

Motivation: 现有PTTMs在噪声环境中的表现未知，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 分析PTTMs在不同噪声类型中的表现，并测试多模态模型（结合视觉特征）的效果。

Result: 噪声下PTTMs性能显著下降，但多模态模型在10 dB音乐噪声中准确率提升至72%。

Conclusion: 多模态PTTM在噪声中表现更优，但对新噪声类型的泛化能力有限，且训练依赖精确转录。

Abstract: Accurate predictive turn-taking models (PTTMs) are essential for naturalistic
human-robot interaction. However, little is known about their performance in
noise. This study therefore explores PTTM performance in types of noise likely
to be encountered once deployed. Our analyses reveal PTTMs are highly sensitive
to noise. Hold/shift accuracy drops from 84% in clean speech to just 52% in 10
dB music noise. Training with noisy data enables a multimodal PTTM, which
includes visual features to better exploit visual cues, with 72% accuracy in 10
dB music noise. The multimodal PTTM outperforms the audio-only PTTM across all
noise types and SNRs, highlighting its ability to exploit visual cues; however,
this does not always generalise to new types of noise. Analysis also reveals
that successful training relies on accurate transcription, limiting the use of
ASR-derived transcriptions to clean conditions. We make code publicly available
for future research.

Method: 利用ASR模拟中度斜坡型听力损失的感知效果，通过控制语音刺激的声学退化并分析音素级混淆模式。

Result: 模拟听力损失导致特定音素混淆（如高频辅音替换）和显著音素删除，测试电池有效区分模拟正常听力和听力受损者。

Abstract: Traditional audiometry often fails to fully characterize the functional
impact of hearing loss on speech understanding, particularly supra-threshold
deficits and frequency-specific perception challenges in conditions like
presbycusis. This paper presents the development and simulated evaluation of a
novel Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)-based frequency-specific speech test
designed to provide granular diagnostic insights. Our approach leverages ASR to
simulate the perceptual effects of moderate sloping hearing loss by processing
speech stimuli under controlled acoustic degradation and subsequently analyzing
phoneme-level confusion patterns. Key findings indicate that simulated hearing
loss introduces specific phoneme confusions, predominantly affecting
high-frequency consonants (e.g., alveolar/palatal to labiodental substitutions)
and leading to significant phoneme deletions, consistent with the acoustic cues
degraded in presbycusis. A test battery curated from these ASR-derived
confusions demonstrated diagnostic value, effectively differentiating between
simulated normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners in a comprehensive
simulation. This ASR-driven methodology offers a promising avenue for
developing objective, granular, and frequency-specific hearing assessment tools
that complement traditional audiometry. Future work will focus on validating
these findings with human participants and exploring the integration of
advanced AI models for enhanced diagnostic precision.

Motivation: 研究语音模型中实际使用的上下文长度（有效上下文），以优化模型设计。

Method: 提出两种测量有效上下文的方法，分析监督和自监督语音Transformer在不同任务中的表现。

Result: 监督模型的有效上下文与任务性质相关，自监督模型的上下文较短，适用于流式模式。

Conclusion: 语音模型的有效上下文较短，自监督模型可直接用于流式任务，无需额外调整。

Abstract: Modern neural speech models benefit from having longer context, and many
approaches have been proposed to increase the maximum context a model can use.
However, few have attempted to measure how much context these models actually
use, i.e., the effective context. Here, we propose two approaches to measuring
the effective context, and use them to analyze different speech Transformers.
For supervised models, we find that the effective context correlates well with
the nature of the task, with fundamental frequency tracking, phone
classification, and word classification requiring increasing amounts of
effective context. For self-supervised models, we find that effective context
increases mainly in the early layers, and remains relatively short -- similar
to the supervised phone model. Given that these models do not use a long
context during prediction, we show that HuBERT can be run in streaming mode
without modification to the architecture and without further fine-tuning.

Result: 在ICHBI上达到64.39的新SOTA分数，超越之前最佳0.85，平均分数提升超1.16。

Conclusion: 软标签知识蒸馏在呼吸音分类中高效且架构无关，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Respiratory sound datasets are limited in size and quality, making high
performance difficult to achieve. Ensemble models help but inevitably increase
compute cost at inference time. Soft label training distills knowledge
efficiently with extra cost only at training. In this study, we explore soft
labels for respiratory sound classification as an architecture-agnostic
approach to distill an ensemble of teacher models into a student model. We
examine different variations of our approach and find that even a single
teacher, identical to the student, considerably improves performance beyond its
own capability, with optimal gains achieved using only a few teachers. We
achieve the new state-of-the-art Score of 64.39 on ICHBI, surpassing the
previous best by 0.85 and improving average Scores across architectures by more
than 1.16. Our results highlight the effectiveness of knowledge distillation
with soft labels for respiratory sound classification, regardless of size or
architecture.

Result: 在AudioCaps数据集上，仅需10步采样即优于现有模型，推理步数降至3步。

Conclusion: AudioTurbo有效结合预训练模型与修正扩散方法，显著提升生成效率与性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have significantly improved the quality and diversity of
audio generation but are hindered by slow inference speed. Rectified flow
enhances inference speed by learning straight-line ordinary differential
equation (ODE) paths. However, this approach requires training a flow-matching
model from scratch and tends to perform suboptimally, or even poorly, at low
step counts. To address the limitations of rectified flow while leveraging the
advantages of advanced pre-trained diffusion models, this study integrates
pre-trained models with the rectified diffusion method to improve the
efficiency of text-to-audio (TTA) generation. Specifically, we propose
AudioTurbo, which learns first-order ODE paths from deterministic noise sample
pairs generated by a pre-trained TTA model. Experiments on the AudioCaps
dataset demonstrate that our model, with only 10 sampling steps, outperforms
prior models and reduces inference to 3 steps compared to a flow-matching-based
acceleration model.

Result: 在两个标准L2S基准测试中，RESOUND在多项指标上表现出色。

Conclusion: RESOUND通过独立优化声学和语义表示，显著提升了语音合成的质量和表现力。

Abstract: Lip-to-speech (L2S) synthesis, which reconstructs speech from visual cues,
faces challenges in accuracy and naturalness due to limited supervision in
capturing linguistic content, accents, and prosody. In this paper, we propose
RESOUND, a novel L2S system that generates intelligible and expressive speech
from silent talking face videos. Leveraging source-filter theory, our method
involves two components: an acoustic path to predict prosody and a semantic
path to extract linguistic features. This separation simplifies learning,
allowing independent optimization of each representation. Additionally, we
enhance performance by integrating speech units, a proven unsupervised speech
representation technique, into waveform generation alongside mel-spectrograms.
This allows RESOUND to synthesize prosodic speech while preserving content and
speaker identity. Experiments conducted on two standard L2S benchmarks confirm
the effectiveness of the proposed method across various metrics.

Abstract: Perceptual voice quality dimensions describe key characteristics of atypical
speech and other speech modulations. Here we develop and evaluate voice quality
models for seven voice and speech dimensions (intelligibility, imprecise
consonants, harsh voice, naturalness, monoloudness, monopitch, and
breathiness). Probes were trained on the public Speech Accessibility (SAP)
project dataset with 11,184 samples from 434 speakers, using embeddings from
frozen pre-trained models as features. We found that our probes had both strong
performance and strong generalization across speech elicitation categories in
the SAP dataset. We further validated zero-shot performance on additional
datasets, encompassing unseen languages and tasks: Italian atypical speech,
English atypical speech, and affective speech. The strong zero-shot performance
and the interpretability of results across an array of evaluations suggests the
utility of using voice quality dimensions in speaking style-related tasks.

Highly compact layer-level tied self-pinching gates each containing only a

Abstract: Complex data are often represented as a graph, which in turn can often be

test, and analyse a KSD-type goodness-of-fit test for IRG models that can be
carried out with a single observation of the network. The test is applicable to
a network of any size and does not depend on the asymptotic distribution of the
test statistic. We also provide theoretical guarantees.

Result: STACI在准确性和可扩展性上优于现有方法，适用于百万级观测数据。

Conclusion: STACI为时空数据提供了一种高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Fitting Gaussian Processes (GPs) provides interpretable aleatoric uncertainty
quantification for estimation of spatio-temporal fields. Spatio-temporal deep
learning models, while scalable, typically assume a simplistic independent
covariance matrix for the response, failing to capture the underlying
correlation structure. However, spatio-temporal GPs suffer from issues of
scalability and various forms of approximation bias resulting from restrictive
assumptions of the covariance kernel function. We propose STACI, a novel
framework consisting of a variational Bayesian neural network approximation of
non-stationary spatio-temporal GP along with a novel spatio-temporal conformal
inference algorithm. STACI is highly scalable, taking advantage of GPU training
capabilities for neural network models, and provides statistically valid
prediction intervals for uncertainty quantification. STACI outperforms
competing GPs and deep methods in accurately approximating spatio-temporal
processes and we show it easily scales to datasets with millions of
observations.

Abstract: Group synchronization is the problem of determining reliable global estimates
from noisy local measurements on networks. The typical task for group
synchronization is to assign elements of a group to the nodes of a graph in a
way that respects group elements given on the edges which encode information
about local pairwise relationships between the nodes. In this paper, we
introduce a novel higher-order group synchronization problem which operates on
a hypergraph and seeks to synchronize higher-order local measurements on the
hyperedges to obtain global estimates on the nodes. Higher-order group
synchronization is motivated by applications to computer vision and image
processing, among other computational problems. First, we define the problem of
higher-order group synchronization and discuss its mathematical foundations.
Specifically, we give necessary and sufficient synchronizability conditions
which establish the importance of cycle consistency in higher-order group
synchronization. Then, we propose the first computational framework for general
higher-order group synchronization; it acts globally and directly on
higher-order measurements using a message passing algorithm. We discuss
theoretical guarantees for our framework, including convergence analyses under
outliers and noise. Finally, we show potential advantages of our method through
numerical experiments. In particular, we show that in certain cases our
higher-order method applied to rotational and angular synchronization
outperforms standard pairwise synchronization methods and is more robust to
outliers. We also show that our method has comparable performance on simulated
cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data compared to a standard cryo-EM
reconstruction package.

TL;DR: 论文证明了在均值-场位置-尺度变分族下，使用重参数化梯度的黑盒变分推断（BBVI）能以几乎与维度无关的速率收敛。对于强对数凹和对数光滑的目标，BBVI的迭代次数为O(log d)，优于全秩位置-尺度族的O(d)依赖。对于重尾族，维度依赖为O(d^{2/k})。若目标对数密度的Hessian为常数，复杂度则无维度依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究BBVI在不同变分族下的收敛速率，特别是维度依赖性的改进，以提升变分推断的效率。

Method: 使用均值-场位置-尺度变分族和重参数化梯度，分析BBVI的收敛速率，并通过Hessian的谱界验证梯度方差界限的紧性。

Result: 对于强对数凹和对数光滑目标，BBVI的收敛速率为O(log d)；重尾族为O(d^{2/k})；若Hessian为常数，则无维度依赖。

Conclusion: BBVI在特定条件下可实现几乎维度无关的收敛速率，为高效变分推断提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We prove that, given a mean-field location-scale variational family,
black-box variational inference (BBVI) with the reparametrization gradient
converges at an almost dimension-independent rate. Specifically, for strongly
log-concave and log-smooth targets, the number of iterations for BBVI with a
sub-Gaussian family to achieve an objective $\epsilon$-close to the global
optimum is $\mathrm{O}(\log d)$, which improves over the $\mathrm{O}(d)$
dependence of full-rank location-scale families. For heavy-tailed families, we
provide a weaker $\mathrm{O}(d^{2/k})$ dimension dependence, where $k$ is the
number of finite moments. Additionally, if the Hessian of the target
log-density is constant, the complexity is free of any explicit dimension
dependence. We also prove that our bound on the gradient variance, which is key
to our result, cannot be improved using only spectral bounds on the Hessian of
the target log-density.

Abstract: Overparameterized neural networks can interpolate a given dataset in many
different ways, prompting the fundamental question: which among these solutions
should we prefer, and what explicit regularization strategies will provably
yield these solutions? This paper addresses the challenge of finding the
sparsest interpolating ReLU network -- i.e., the network with the fewest
nonzero parameters or neurons -- a goal with wide-ranging implications for
efficiency, generalization, interpretability, theory, and model compression.
Unlike post hoc pruning approaches, we propose a continuous, almost-everywhere
differentiable training objective whose global minima are guaranteed to
correspond to the sparsest single-hidden-layer ReLU networks that fit the data.
This result marks a conceptual advance: it recasts the combinatorial problem of
sparse interpolation as a smooth optimization task, potentially enabling the
use of gradient-based training methods. Our objective is based on minimizing
$\ell^p$ quasinorms of the weights for $0 < p < 1$, a classical
sparsity-promoting strategy in finite-dimensional settings. However, applying
these ideas to neural networks presents new challenges: the function class is
infinite-dimensional, and the weights are learned using a highly nonconvex
objective. We prove that, under our formulation, global minimizers correspond
exactly to sparsest solutions. Our work lays a foundation for understanding
when and how continuous sparsity-inducing objectives can be leveraged to
recover sparse networks through training.

Abstract: Polyak-Ruppert averaging is a widely used technique to achieve the optimal
asymptotic variance of stochastic approximation (SA) algorithms, yet its
high-probability performance guarantees remain underexplored in general
settings. In this paper, we present a general framework for establishing
non-asymptotic concentration bounds for the error of averaged SA iterates. Our
approach assumes access to individual concentration bounds for the unaveraged
iterates and yields a sharp bound on the averaged iterates. We also construct
an example, showing the tightness of our result up to constant multiplicative
factors. As direct applications, we derive tight concentration bounds for
contractive SA algorithms and for algorithms such as temporal difference
learning and Q-learning with averaging, obtaining new bounds in settings where
traditional analysis is challenging.

Abstract: Temporal networks observed continuously over time through timestamped
relational events data are commonly encountered in application settings
including online social media communications, financial transactions, and
international relations. Temporal networks often exhibit community structure
and strong dependence patterns among node pairs. This dependence can be modeled
through mutual excitations, where an interaction event from a sender to a
receiver node increases the possibility of future events among other node
pairs.
  We provide statistical results for a class of models that we call dependent
community Hawkes (DCH) models, which combine the stochastic block model with
mutually exciting Hawkes processes for modeling both community structure and
dependence among node pairs, respectively. We derive a non-asymptotic upper
bound on the misclustering error of spectral clustering on the event count
matrix as a function of the number of nodes and communities, time duration, and
the amount of dependence in the model. Our result leverages recent results on
bounding an appropriate distance between a multivariate Hawkes process count
vector and a Gaussian vector, along with results from random matrix theory. We
also propose a DCH model that incorporates only self and reciprocal excitation
along with highly scalable parameter estimation using a Generalized Method of
Moments (GMM) estimator that we demonstrate to be consistent for growing
network size and time duration.

Abstract: Continuous diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in data
generation across various domains, yet their efficiency remains constrained by
two critical limitations: (1) the local adjacency structure of the forward
Markov process, which restricts long-range transitions in the data space, and
(2) inherent biases introduced during the simulation of time-inhomogeneous
reverse denoising processes. To address these challenges, we propose Quantized
Transition Diffusion (QTD), a novel approach that integrates data quantization
with discrete diffusion dynamics. Our method first transforms the continuous
data distribution $p_*$ into a discrete one $q_*$ via histogram approximation
and binary encoding, enabling efficient representation in a structured discrete
latent space. We then design a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) with Hamming
distance-based transitions as the forward process, which inherently supports
long-range movements in the original data space. For reverse-time sampling, we
introduce a \textit{truncated uniformization} technique to simulate the reverse
CTMC, which can provably provide unbiased generation from $q_*$ under minimal
score assumptions. Through a novel KL dynamic analysis of the reverse CTMC, we
prove that QTD can generate samples with $O(d\ln^2(d/\epsilon))$ score
evaluations in expectation to approximate the $d$--dimensional target
distribution $p_*$ within an $\epsilon$ error tolerance. Our method not only
establishes state-of-the-art inference efficiency but also advances the
theoretical foundations of diffusion-based generative modeling by unifying
discrete and continuous diffusion paradigms.

Abstract: This paper considers a canonical problem in kernel regression: how good are
the model performances when it is trained by the popular online first-order
algorithms, compared to the offline ones, such as ridge and ridgeless
regression? In this paper, we analyze the foundational single-pass Stochastic
Gradient Descent (SGD) in kernel regression under source condition where the
optimal predictor can even not belong to the RKHS, i.e. the model is
misspecified. Specifically, we focus on the inner product kernel over the
sphere and characterize the exact orders of the excess risk curves under
different scales of sample sizes $n$ concerning the input dimension $d$.
Surprisingly, we show that SGD achieves min-max optimal rates up to constants
among all the scales, without suffering the saturation, a prevalent phenomenon
observed in (ridge) regression, except when the model is highly misspecified
and the learning is in a final stage where $n\gg d^{\gamma}$ with any constant
$\gamma >0$. The main reason for SGD to overcome the curse of saturation is the
exponentially decaying step size schedule, a common practice in deep neural
network training. As a byproduct, we provide the \emph{first} provable
advantage of the scheme over the iterative averaging method in the common

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations for black-box models aim to pr ovide insight into
an algorithmic decision to its recipient. For a binary classification problem
an individual counterfactual details which features might be changed for the
model to infer the opposite class. High-dimensional feature spaces that are
typical of machine learning classification models admit many possible
counterfactual examples to a decision, and so it is important to identify
additional criteria to select the most useful counterfactuals. In this paper,
we explore the idea that the counterfactuals should be maximally informative
when considering the knowledge of a specific individual about the underlying
classifier. To quantify this information gain we explicitly model the knowledge
of the individual, and assess the uncertainty of predictions which the
individual makes by the width of a conformal prediction interval. Regions of
feature space where the prediction interval is wide correspond to areas where
the confidence in decision making is low, and an additional counterfactual
example might be more informative to an individual. To explore and evaluate our
individualised conformal prediction interval counterfactuals (CPICFs), first we
present a synthetic data set on a hypercube which allows us to fully visualise
the decision boundary, conformal intervals via three different methods, and
resultant CPICFs. Second, in this synthetic data set we explore the impact of a
single CPICF on the knowledge of an individual locally around the original
query. Finally, in both our synthetic data set and a complex real world dataset
with a combination of continuous and discrete variables, we measure the utility
of these counterfactuals via data augmentation, testing the performance on a
held out set.

Abstract: Predictions in the form of sets of probability distributions, so-called
credal sets, provide a suitable means to represent a learner's epistemic
uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a theoretically grounded approach to
credal prediction based on the statistical notion of relative likelihood: The
target of prediction is the set of all (conditional) probability distributions
produced by the collection of plausible models, namely those models whose
relative likelihood exceeds a specified threshold. This threshold has an
intuitive interpretation and allows for controlling the trade-off between
correctness and precision of credal predictions. We tackle the problem of
approximating credal sets defined in this way by means of suitably modified
ensemble learning techniques. To validate our approach, we illustrate its
effectiveness by experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrating superior
uncertainty representation without compromising predictive performance. We also
compare our method against several state-of-the-art baselines in credal
prediction.

Abstract: We present a novel method for efficiently computing optimal transport maps
and Wasserstein barycenters in high-dimensional spaces. Our approach uses
conditional normalizing flows to approximate the input distributions as
invertible pushforward transformations from a common latent space. This makes
it possible to directly solve the primal problem using gradient-based
minimization of the transport cost, unlike previous methods that rely on dual
formulations and complex adversarial optimization. We show how this approach
can be extended to compute Wasserstein barycenters by solving a conditional
variance minimization problem. A key advantage of our conditional architecture
is that it enables the computation of barycenters for hundreds of input
distributions, which was computationally infeasible with previous methods. Our
numerical experiments illustrate that our approach yields accurate results
across various high-dimensional tasks and compares favorably with previous
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for semantic hypothesis testing tailored to
imaging inverse problems. Modern imaging methods struggle to support hypothesis
testing, a core component of the scientific method that is essential for the
rigorous interpretation of experiments and robust interfacing with
decision-making processes. There are three main reasons why image-based
hypothesis testing is challenging. First, the difficulty of using a single
observation to simultaneously reconstruct an image, formulate hypotheses, and
quantify their statistical significance. Second, the hypotheses encountered in
imaging are mostly of semantic nature, rather than quantitative statements
about pixel values. Third, it is challenging to control test error
probabilities because the null and alternative distributions are often unknown.
Our proposed approach addresses these difficulties by leveraging concepts from
self-supervised computational imaging, vision-language models, and
non-parametric hypothesis testing with e-values. We demonstrate our proposed
framework through numerical experiments related to image-based phenotyping,
where we achieve excellent power while robustly controlling Type I errors.

*Agnideep Aich,Ashit Baran Aich,Bruce Wade*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为IGNIS Network的神经网络框架，用于解决Archimedean copulas的参数估计问题，克服了传统方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如MoM、MLE和MPL）在处理A1和A2等复杂依赖结构的copulas时存在非单调性和数值不稳定等问题，需要一种更鲁棒的方法。

Method: IGNIS Network通过神经网络直接从可观测的依赖度量映射到copula参数，训练数据覆盖了五种Archimedean copula家族。

Result: 模拟研究表明，IGNIS Network比MoM减少了估计误差，并在真实数据集（金融、医疗、环境）上验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 神经网络方法在依赖建模中具有变革潜力，IGNIS Network为现代应用提供了更鲁棒和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter estimation for Archimedean copulas remains a challenging problem,
particularly for the recently developed A1 and A2 families that exhibit complex
dependency structures. Traditional methods, such as the Method of Moments
(MoM), Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), and Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood
(MPL), often struggle due to issues of non-monotonic relationship with
dependency measures such as Kendall's tau (as in the case of A1) and numerical
instability. In this paper, we present the IGNIS Network, a novel, unified
neural framework that learns a direct mapping from observable dependency
measures to copula parameters, thereby overcoming the limitations of classical
approaches. Our approach is trained on simulated data spanning five Archimedean
copula families including Clayton, Gumbel, Frank, A1, and A2, ensuring its
general applicability across the entire family. Extensive simulation studies
demonstrate that the IGNIS Network reduces estimation errors compared to MoM,
while inherently enforcing parameter constraints through theory-guided
post-processing. We further validate the practical utility of our method on
diverse real-world datasets, including financial returns (AAPL-MSFT),
healthcare metrics (CDC Diabetes indicators), and environmental measurements
(PM2.5 air quality). Our results underscore the transformative potential of
neural methods for robust and accurate dependence modeling in modern
applications.

Abstract: We introduce the Symplectic Generative Network (SGN), a deep generative model
that leverages Hamiltonian mechanics to construct an invertible,
volume-preserving mapping between a latent space and the data space. By
endowing the latent space with a symplectic structure and modeling data
generation as the time evolution of a Hamiltonian system, SGN achieves exact
likelihood evaluation without incurring the computational overhead of Jacobian
determinant calculations. In this work, we provide a rigorous mathematical
foundation for SGNs through a comprehensive theoretical framework that
includes: (i) complete proofs of invertibility and volume preservation, (ii) a
formal complexity analysis with theoretical comparisons to Variational
Autoencoders and Normalizing Flows, (iii) strengthened universal approximation
results with quantitative error bounds, (iv) an information-theoretic analysis
based on the geometry of statistical manifolds, and (v) an extensive stability
analysis with adaptive integration guarantees. These contributions highlight
the fundamental advantages of SGNs and establish a solid foundation for future
empirical investigations and applications to complex, high-dimensional data.

Abstract: Accurate diabetes risk prediction relies on identifying key features from
complex health datasets, but conventional methods like mutual information (MI)
filters and genetic algorithms (GAs) often overlook extreme dependencies
critical for high-risk subpopulations. In this study we introduce a
feature-selection framework using the upper-tail dependence coefficient
({\lambda}U) of the novel A2 copula, which quantifies how often extreme higher
values of a predictor co-occur with diabetes diagnoses (target variable).
Applied to the CDC Diabetes Health Indicators dataset (n=253,680), our method
prioritizes five predictors (self-reported general health, high blood pressure,
body mass index, mobility limitations, and high cholesterol levels) based on
upper tail dependencies. These features match or outperform MI and GA selected
subsets across four classifiers (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression,
Gradient Boosting), achieving accuracy up to 86.5% (XGBoost) and AUC up to
0.806 (Gradient Boosting), rivaling the full 21-feature model. Permutation
importance confirms clinical relevance, with BMI and general health driving
accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply a copula's
upper-tail dependence for supervised feature selection, bridging extreme-value
theory and machine learning to deliver a practical toolkit for diabetes
prevention.

Abstract: Modern foundation models exhibit remarkable out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization, solving tasks far beyond the support of their training data.
However, the theoretical principles underpinning this phenomenon remain
elusive. This paper investigates this problem by examining the compositional
generalization abilities of diffusion models in image generation. Our analysis
reveals that while neural network architectures are expressive enough to
represent a wide range of models -- including many with undesirable behavior on
OOD inputs -- the true, generalizable model that aligns with human expectations
typically corresponds to the simplest among those consistent with the training
data.
  Motivated by this observation, we develop a theoretical framework for OOD
generalization via simplicity, quantified using a predefined simplicity metric.
We analyze two key regimes: (1) the constant-gap setting, where the true model
is strictly simpler than all spurious alternatives by a fixed gap, and (2) the
vanishing-gap setting, where the fixed gap is replaced by a smoothness
condition ensuring that models close in simplicity to the true model yield
similar predictions. For both regimes, we study the regularized maximum
likelihood estimator and establish the first sharp sample complexity guarantees
for learning the true, generalizable, simple model.

Abstract: In the era of AI, neural networks have become increasingly popular for
modeling, inference, and prediction, largely due to their potential for
universal approximation. With the proliferation of such deep learning models, a
question arises: are leaner statistical methods still relevant? To shed insight
on this question, we employ the mechanistic nonlinear ordinary differential
equation (ODE) inverse problem as a testbed, using physics-informed neural
network (PINN) as a representative of the deep learning paradigm and
manifold-constrained Gaussian process inference (MAGI) as a representative of
statistically principled methods. Through case studies involving the SEIR model
from epidemiology and the Lorenz model from chaotic dynamics, we demonstrate
that statistical methods are far from obsolete, especially when working with
sparse and noisy observations. On tasks such as parameter inference and
trajectory reconstruction, statistically principled methods consistently
achieve lower bias and variance, while using far fewer parameters and requiring
less hyperparameter tuning. Statistical methods can also decisively outperform
deep learning models on out-of-sample future prediction, where the absence of
relevant data often leads overparameterized models astray. Additionally, we
find that statistically principled approaches are more robust to accumulation
of numerical imprecision and can represent the underlying system more faithful
to the true governing ODEs.
