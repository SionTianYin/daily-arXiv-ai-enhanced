### [1] [Rosetta-PL: Propositional Logic as a Benchmark for Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00001)
*Shaun Baek,Shaun Esua-Mensah,Cyrus Tsui,Sejan Vigneswaralingam,Abdullah Alali,Michael Lu,Vasu Sharma,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Rosetta-PL是一个用于评估大语言模型在逻辑推理和泛化能力上的基准，通过翻译逻辑命题数据集并微调LLM，研究发现翻译过程中保持逻辑关系能显著提升精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在高资源自然语言上表现良好，但在低资源环境和深度逻辑推理任务中效果有限，因此需要开发新的评估方法。

Method: 将Lean中的逻辑命题数据集翻译为自定义逻辑语言，用于微调LLM（如GPT-4o），并分析数据集大小和翻译方法对模型性能的影响。

Result: 翻译过程中保持逻辑关系显著提升精度，且训练样本超过约20,000时准确率趋于稳定。

Conclusion: 研究为优化LLM在形式推理任务中的训练提供了指导，并有助于提升低资源语言应用的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are primarily trained on high-resource natural
languages, limiting their effectiveness in low-resource settings and in tasks
requiring deep logical reasoning. This research introduces Rosetta-PL, a
benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' logical reasoning and generalization
capabilities in a controlled environment. We construct Rosetta-PL by
translating a dataset of logical propositions from Lean into a custom logical
language, which is then used to fine-tune an LLM (e.g., GPT-4o). Our
experiments analyze the impact of the size of the dataset and the translation
methodology on the performance of the model. Our results indicate that
preserving logical relationships in the translation process significantly
boosts precision, with accuracy plateauing beyond roughly 20,000 training
samples. These insights provide valuable guidelines for optimizing LLM training
in formal reasoning tasks and improving performance in various low-resource
language applications.

### [2] [Symbol grounding in computational systems: A paradox of intentions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00002)
*Vincent C. Müller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出计算主义无法解释符号接地问题，无论计算是基于有意义还是无意义的符号，都会导致语义先天论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨计算主义在解释符号接地问题时的局限性，揭示其隐含的语义先天论问题。

Method: 通过逻辑分析，提出计算主义在符号接地问题上的两种可能性（有意义或无意义符号），并分别推导其后果。

Result: 无论计算主义采用哪种符号形式，都无法避免语义先天论的结论。

Conclusion: 计算主义无法独立解释符号接地问题，需重新审视其理论基础。

Abstract: The paper presents a paradoxical feature of computational systems that
suggests that computationalism cannot explain symbol grounding. If the mind is
a digital computer, as computationalism claims, then it can be computing either
over meaningful symbols or over meaningless symbols. If it is computing over
meaningful symbols its functioning presupposes the existence of meaningful
symbols in the system, i.e. it implies semantic nativism. If the mind is
computing over meaningless symbols, no intentional cognitive processes are
available prior to symbol grounding. In this case, no symbol grounding could
take place since any grounding presupposes intentional cognitive processes. So,
whether computing in the mind is over meaningless or over meaningful symbols,
computationalism implies semantic nativism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理学在NLP中的重要性日益凸显，需系统性整合心理学理论以提升LLM的人类认知模拟能力。

Method: 综述认知、发展、行为、社会、人格心理学及心理语言学的跨领域见解，分析当前应用趋势与不足。

Result: 揭示了心理学理论在LLM开发中的现有应用与潜在冲突，为跨学科整合提供方向。

Conclusion: 呼吁更深入地将心理学融入未来NLP研究，以弥合学科分歧并优化LLM性能。

Abstract: Psychological insights have long shaped pivotal NLP breakthroughs, including
the cognitive underpinnings of attention mechanisms, formative reinforcement
learning, and Theory of Mind-inspired social modeling. As Large Language Models
(LLMs) continue to grow in scale and complexity, there is a rising consensus
that psychology is essential for capturing human-like cognition, behavior, and
interaction. This paper reviews how psychological theories can inform and
enhance stages of LLM development, including data, pre-training, post-training,
and evaluation\&application. Our survey integrates insights from cognitive,
developmental, behavioral, social, personality psychology, and
psycholinguistics. Our analysis highlights current trends and gaps in how
psychological theories are applied. By examining both cross-domain connections
and points of tension, we aim to bridge disciplinary divides and promote more
thoughtful integration of psychology into future NLP research.

### [4] [LangVAE and LangSpace: Building and Probing for Language Model VAEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00004)
*Danilo S. Carvalho,Yingji Zhang,Harriet Unsworth,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LangVAE是一个基于预训练大语言模型（LLMs）构建变分自编码器（VAEs）的新框架，旨在生成更紧凑且语义解耦的表示。配套工具LangSpace提供多种分析方法，实验验证了其灵活性和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用预训练语言模型的知识构建更高效的文本表示，并系统化实验和理解文本表示。

Method: 通过LangVAE框架构建VAEs，结合LangSpace工具进行表示分析，包括向量遍历、解耦度量和聚类可视化。

Result: 实验展示了不同编码器-解码器组合和标注输入的广泛交互，验证了框架在泛化和解耦方面的潜力。

Conclusion: LangVAE为文本表示的系统化实验和理解提供了有前景的框架。

Abstract: We present LangVAE, a novel framework for modular construction of variational
autoencoders (VAEs) on top of pre-trained large language models (LLMs). Such
language model VAEs can encode the knowledge of their pre-trained components
into more compact and semantically disentangled representations. The
representations obtained in this way can be analysed with the LangVAE companion
framework: LangSpace, which implements a collection of probing methods, such as
vector traversal and interpolation, disentanglement measures, and cluster
visualisations. LangVAE and LangSpace offer a flexible, efficient and scalable
way of building and analysing textual representations, with simple integration
for models available on the HuggingFace Hub. Additionally, we conducted a set
of experiments with different encoder and decoder combinations, as well as
annotated inputs, revealing a wide range of interactions across architectural
families and sizes w.r.t. generalisation and disentanglement. Our findings
demonstrate a promising framework for systematising the experimentation and
understanding of textual representations.

### [5] [Toward a digital twin of U.S. Congress](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00006)
*Hayden Helm,Tianyi Chen,Harvey McGuinness,Paige Lee,Brandon Duderstadt,Carey E. Priebe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于语言模型的美国国会议员虚拟模型，证明其符合数字孪生的定义，并展示了生成推文在预测投票行为和党派倾向中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过语言模型构建国会议员的数字孪生，以辅助资源分配并影响立法动态。

Method: 使用每日更新的国会议员推文数据集，训练特定于议员的语言模型，生成难以区分的推文。

Result: 生成的推文可用于预测投票行为和党派倾向，为利益相关者提供决策支持。

Conclusion: 研究展示了数字孪生在政治领域的潜力，但也指出了局限性和未来扩展方向。

Abstract: In this paper we provide evidence that a virtual model of U.S.
congresspersons based on a collection of language models satisfies the
definition of a digital twin. In particular, we introduce and provide
high-level descriptions of a daily-updated dataset that contains every Tweet
from every U.S. congressperson during their respective terms. We demonstrate
that a modern language model equipped with congressperson-specific subsets of
this data are capable of producing Tweets that are largely indistinguishable
from actual Tweets posted by their physical counterparts. We illustrate how
generated Tweets can be used to predict roll-call vote behaviors and to
quantify the likelihood of congresspersons crossing party lines, thereby
assisting stakeholders in allocating resources and potentially impacting
real-world legislative dynamics. We conclude with a discussion of the
limitations and important extensions of our analysis.

### [7] [Efficient Knowledge Transfer in Multi-Task Learning through Task-Adaptive Low-Rank Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00009)
*Xiao Zhang,Kangsheng Wang,Tianyu Hu,Huimin Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TA-LoRA是一种基于提示调优的多任务学习方法，通过低秩表示和快慢权重机制解决任务异质性，在16个任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型在新任务上表现不佳，多任务学习虽能共享知识，但提示调优难以捕捉任务异质性。

Method: 提出TA-LoRA，结合低秩表示和快慢权重机制，避免共享与任务特定知识混淆，并引入零初始化注意力机制。

Result: 在16个任务上，TA-LoRA在完整数据和少样本设置下均达到最优性能，且参数效率高。

Conclusion: TA-LoRA有效解决了任务异质性，提升了多任务学习的性能与效率。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) demonstrate remarkable intelligence but
struggle with emerging tasks unseen during training in real-world applications.
Training separate models for each new task is usually impractical. Multi-task
learning (MTL) addresses this challenge by transferring shared knowledge from
source tasks to target tasks. As an dominant parameter-efficient fine-tuning
method, prompt tuning (PT) enhances MTL by introducing an adaptable vector that
captures task-specific knowledge, which acts as a prefix to the original prompt
that preserves shared knowledge, while keeping PLM parameters frozen. However,
PT struggles to effectively capture the heterogeneity of task-specific
knowledge due to its limited representational capacity. To address this
challenge, we propose Task-Adaptive Low-Rank Representation (TA-LoRA), an MTL
method built on PT, employing the low-rank representation to model task
heterogeneity and a fast-slow weights mechanism where the slow weight encodes
shared knowledge, while the fast weight captures task-specific nuances,
avoiding the mixing of shared and task-specific knowledge, caused by training
low-rank representations from scratch. Moreover, a zero-initialized attention
mechanism is introduced to minimize the disruption of immature low-rank
components on original prompts during warm-up epochs. Experiments on 16 tasks
demonstrate that TA-LoRA achieves state-of-the-art performance in full-data and
few-shot settings while maintaining superior parameter efficiency.

*Tri Nguyen,Lohith Srikanth Pentapalli,Magnus Sieverding,Laurah Turner,Seth Overla,Weibing Zheng,Chris Zhou,David Furniss,Danielle Weber,Michael Gharib,Matt Kelleher,Michael Shukis,Cameron Pawlik,Kelly Cohen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于语言特征的检测方法，用于识别大型语言模型（LLMs）中的越狱行为，并在临床教育平台2-Sigma上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的越狱行为威胁其在敏感领域（如教育）的安全使用，因此需要一种有效的检测方法。

Method: 通过标注2,300多个提示，提取四个与越狱行为相关的语言特征，并训练多种预测模型（如决策树、模糊逻辑分类器等）。

Result: 基于特征的预测模型表现优于提示工程，其中模糊决策树效果最佳。

Conclusion: 语言特征模型是检测LLMs越狱行为的有效且可解释的方法，未来可探索混合框架以提升实时监测能力。

Abstract: Jailbreaking in Large Language Models (LLMs) threatens their safe use in
sensitive domains like education by allowing users to bypass ethical
safeguards. This study focuses on detecting jailbreaks in 2-Sigma, a clinical
education platform that simulates patient interactions using LLMs. We annotated
over 2,300 prompts across 158 conversations using four linguistic variables
shown to correlate strongly with jailbreak behavior. The extracted features
were used to train several predictive models, including Decision Trees, Fuzzy
Logic-based classifiers, Boosting methods, and Logistic Regression. Results
show that feature-based predictive models consistently outperformed Prompt
Engineering, with the Fuzzy Decision Tree achieving the best overall
performance. Our findings demonstrate that linguistic-feature-based models are
effective and explainable alternatives for jailbreak detection. We suggest
future work explore hybrid frameworks that integrate prompt-based flexibility
with rule-based robustness for real-time, spectrum-based jailbreak monitoring
in educational LLMs.

### [10] [Performance Evaluation of Emotion Classification in Japanese Using RoBERTa and DeBERTa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00013)
*Yoichi Takenaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究旨在构建一个高精度模型，用于预测日语文本中八种Plutchik情感的存在与否。通过微调预训练语言模型，DeBERTa-v3-large表现最佳，优于其他模型和大型语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日语文本情感检测在社交媒体监控和客户反馈分析中具有实际应用价值，但资源稀缺和类别不平衡问题影响了模型性能。

Method: 使用WRIME语料库，将读者平均强度分数转换为二元标签，并微调四种预训练语言模型（BERT、RoBERTa、DeBERTa-v3-base、DeBERTa-v3-large）。同时评估了两种大型语言模型（TinySwallow-1.5B-Instruct和ChatGPT-4o），以准确率和F1分数为评估指标。

Result: DeBERTa-v3-large在平均准确率（0.860）和F1分数（0.662）上表现最佳，优于其他模型。大型语言模型表现较差，ChatGPT-4o和TinySwallow-1.5B-Instruct的平均F1分数分别为0.527和0.292。

Conclusion: 微调的DeBERTa-v3-large模型是目前日语二元情感分类的最可靠解决方案。未来工作应增加稀有情感数据、减小模型规模，并探索提示工程以提升大型语言模型性能。

Abstract: Background Practical applications such as social media monitoring and
customer-feedback analysis require accurate emotion detection for Japanese
text, yet resource scarcity and class imbalance hinder model performance.
  Objective This study aims to build a high-accuracy model for predicting the
presence or absence of eight Plutchik emotions in Japanese sentences.
  Methods Using the WRIME corpus, we transform reader-averaged intensity scores
into binary labels and fine-tune four pre-trained language models (BERT,
RoBERTa, DeBERTa-v3-base, DeBERTa-v3-large). For context, we also assess two
large language models (TinySwallow-1.5B-Instruct and ChatGPT-4o). Accuracy and
F1-score serve as evaluation metrics.
  Results DeBERTa-v3-large attains the best mean accuracy (0.860) and F1-score
(0.662), outperforming all other models. It maintains robust F1 across both
high-frequency emotions (e.g., Joy, Anticipation) and low-frequency emotions
(e.g., Anger, Trust). The LLMs lag, with ChatGPT-4o and
TinySwallow-1.5B-Instruct scoring 0.527 and 0.292 in mean F1, respectively.
  Conclusion The fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3-large model currently offers the most
reliable solution for binary emotion classification in Japanese. We release
this model as a pip-installable package (pip install
deberta-emotion-predictor). Future work should augment data for rare emotions,
reduce model size, and explore prompt engineering to improve LLM performance.
  This manuscript is under review for possible publication in New Generation
Computing.

### [11] [Manifold-Constrained Sentence Embeddings via Triplet Loss: Projecting Semantics onto Spheres, Tori, and Möbius Strips](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00014)
*Vinit K. Chavan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将句子嵌入约束在连续流形（如单位球面、环面和莫比乌斯带）的新框架，通过三元组损失训练，显著提升了嵌入的区分性和拓扑结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统句子嵌入通常位于无约束的欧几里得空间，可能无法充分反映语言的复杂关系，因此需要探索几何约束的嵌入方法。

Method: 使用三元组损失将句子嵌入约束在单位球面、环面和莫比乌斯带上，通过微分几何约束优化嵌入空间。

Result: 在AG News和MBTI数据集上，流形约束嵌入（尤其是球面和莫比乌斯带）在聚类质量（Silhouette Score）和分类性能（Accuracy）上显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 流形空间的嵌入方法为几何表示学习提供了新的数学基础，拓扑结构与语义分离的互补性在NLP中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in representation learning have emphasized the role of
embedding geometry in capturing semantic structure. Traditional sentence
embeddings typically reside in unconstrained Euclidean spaces, which may limit
their ability to reflect complex relationships in language. In this work, we
introduce a novel framework that constrains sentence embeddings to lie on
continuous manifolds -- specifically the unit sphere, torus, and M\"obius strip
-- using triplet loss as the core training objective. By enforcing differential
geometric constraints on the output space, our approach encourages the learning
of embeddings that are both discriminative and topologically structured.
  We evaluate our method on benchmark datasets (AG News and MBTI) and compare
it to classical baselines including TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and unconstrained
Keras-derived embeddings. Our results demonstrate that manifold-constrained
embeddings, particularly those projected onto spheres and M\"obius strips,
significantly outperform traditional approaches in both clustering quality
(Silhouette Score) and classification performance (Accuracy). These findings
highlight the value of embedding in manifold space -- where topological
structure complements semantic separation -- offering a new and mathematically
grounded direction for geometric representation learning in NLP.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）和网络爬虫技术的自动化系统，用于解决孟加拉国交通事故数据收集的不可靠问题。系统包括网页爬取、新闻分类、数据提取和去重四个模块，并展示了实际应用效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发展中国家如孟加拉国的交通事故数据收集存在手动、分散和不可靠的问题，导致数据缺失和不一致。

Method: 系统采用LLM（Gemini-2.0-Flash）和网络爬虫技术，包括自动化爬取代码生成、新闻收集、分类与结构化数据提取以及去重算法。

Result: 系统在111天内爬取了14个新闻网站的15,000多篇文章，识别出705起独立事故。代码生成模块准确率达91.3%，验证准确率为80%。吉大港事故最多。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于LLM的自动化系统能够高效、准确地收集交通事故数据，为数据驱动的道路安全政策制定提供了基础。

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a major public safety and socio-economic issue
in developing countries like Bangladesh. Existing accident data collection is
largely manual, fragmented, and unreliable, resulting in underreporting and
inconsistent records. This research proposes a fully automated system using
Large Language Models (LLMs) and web scraping techniques to address these
challenges. The pipeline consists of four components: automated web scraping
code generation, news collection from online sources, accident news
classification with structured data extraction, and duplicate removal. The
system uses the multimodal generative LLM Gemini-2.0-Flash for seamless
automation. The code generation module classifies webpages into pagination,
dynamic, or infinite scrolling categories and generates suitable Python scripts
for scraping. LLMs also classify and extract key accident information such as
date, time, location, fatalities, injuries, road type, vehicle types, and
pedestrian involvement. A deduplication algorithm ensures data integrity by
removing duplicate reports. The system scraped 14 major Bangladeshi news sites
over 111 days (Oct 1, 2024 - Jan 20, 2025), processing over 15,000 news
articles and identifying 705 unique accidents. The code generation module
achieved 91.3% calibration and 80% validation accuracy. Chittagong reported the
highest number of accidents (80), fatalities (70), and injuries (115), followed
by Dhaka, Faridpur, Gazipur, and Cox's Bazar. Peak accident times were morning
(8-9 AM), noon (12-1 PM), and evening (6-7 PM). A public repository was also
developed with usage instructions. This study demonstrates the viability of an
LLM-powered, scalable system for accurate, low-effort accident data collection,
providing a foundation for data-driven road safety policymaking in Bangladesh.

### [13] [Sparks of Tabular Reasoning via Text2SQL Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00016)
*Josefa Lia Stoisser,Marc Boubnovski Martell,Julien Fauqueur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段框架，通过SQL监督提升大型语言模型在表格数据上的推理能力，显著提升了Text-to-SQL任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Text-to-SQL任务仅关注查询生成，而本文旨在通过SQL监督教会模型更通用的表格数据推理能力。

Method: 1. 从真实SQL查询中合成详细的链式思维（CoT）轨迹，提供逐步监督；2. 引入GRPO强化学习目标，将SQL执行准确性与通用推理能力关联。

Result: 在标准Text-to-SQL基准上表现提升，尤其在BIRD和CRT-QA数据集上显著增强泛化能力。LLaMA模型准确率提升20%，Qwen提升5%。

Conclusion: SQL不仅是目标形式，还能作为学习结构化数据通用推理的有效支架。

Abstract: This work reframes the Text-to-SQL task as a pathway for teaching large
language models (LLMs) to reason over and manipulate tabular data--moving
beyond the traditional focus on query generation. We propose a two-stage
framework that leverages SQL supervision to develop transferable table
reasoning capabilities. First, we synthesize detailed chain-of-thought (CoT)
traces from real-world SQL queries, providing step-by-step, clause-level
supervision that teaches the model how to traverse, filter, and aggregate table
fields. Second, we introduce a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
reinforcement learning objective that connects SQL execution accuracy to
generalizable reasoning by encouraging steps that extend beyond task-specific
syntax and transfer across datasets. Empirically, our approach improves
performance on standard Text-to-SQL benchmarks and achieves substantial gains
on reasoning-intensive datasets such as BIRD and CRT-QA, demonstrating enhanced
generalization and interpretability. Specifically, the distilled-quantized
LLaMA model achieved a 20\% increase in accuracy when trained on Text-to-SQL
tasks, while Qwen achieved a 5\% increase. These results suggest that SQL can
serve not only as a target formalism but also as an effective scaffold for
learning robust, transferable reasoning over structured data.

language models (LLMs), we developed a graph structured feature marker database
to retrieve entities linked to differential genes for cell reconstruction. We
further designed a multi task workflow to optimize the annotation process.
Compared to general purpose LLMs, our method improves human evaluation scores
by up to 0.21 and semantic similarity by 6.1% across 11 tissue types, while
more closely aligning with the cognitive logic of manual annotation.

Abstract: Prompt engineering enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform a variety
of tasks. However, lengthy prompts significantly increase computational
complexity and economic costs. To address this issue, we study six prompt
compression methods for LLMs, aiming to reduce prompt length while maintaining
LLM response quality. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis
covering aspects such as generation performance, model hallucinations, efficacy
in multimodal tasks, word omission analysis, and more. We evaluate these
methods across 13 datasets, including news, scientific articles, commonsense
QA, math QA, long-context QA, and VQA datasets. Our experiments reveal that
prompt compression has a greater impact on LLM performance in long contexts
compared to short ones. In the Longbench evaluation, moderate compression even
enhances LLM performance. Our code and data is available at

*Sruly Rosenblat,Tim O'Reilly,Ilan Strauss*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究使用DE-COP方法分析OpenAI模型是否未经许可使用了O'Reilly Media的版权内容，发现GPT-4o对付费内容识别率高，而GPT-3.5 Turbo对公开内容更敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨OpenAI模型是否在未经授权的情况下使用了受版权保护的O'Reilly Media书籍内容。

Method: 使用DE-COP成员推理攻击方法，分析GPT-4o、GPT-3.5 Turbo和GPT-4o Mini对O'Reilly书籍内容的识别能力。

Result: GPT-4o对付费内容识别率较高（AUROC=82%），GPT-3.5 Turbo对公开内容更敏感，GPT-4o Mini无显著识别能力。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁提高企业透明度，建立AI内容训练的正式许可框架。

Abstract: Using a legally obtained dataset of 34 copyrighted O'Reilly Media books, we
apply the DE-COP membership inference attack method to investigate whether
OpenAI's large language models were trained on copyrighted content without
consent. Our AUROC scores show that GPT-4o, OpenAI's more recent and capable
model, demonstrates strong recognition of paywalled O'Reilly book content
(AUROC = 82\%), compared to OpenAI's earlier model GPT-3.5 Turbo. In contrast,
GPT-3.5 Turbo shows greater relative recognition of publicly accessible
O'Reilly book samples. GPT-4o Mini, as a much smaller model, shows no knowledge
of public or non-public O'Reilly Media content when tested (AUROC $\approx$
50\%). Testing multiple models, with the same cutoff date, helps us account for
potential language shifts over time that might bias our findings. These results
highlight the urgent need for increased corporate transparency regarding
pre-training data sources as a means to develop formal licensing frameworks for
AI content training

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于数据增强和Transformer模型的食品危害检测系统，通过EDA和焦点损失等技术缓解类别不平衡问题，显著提升了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食品危害检测任务面临类别不平衡、文本短且非结构化、语义类别重叠等挑战，需要有效方法提升分类性能。

Method: 使用BERT和RoBERTa作为基础分类器，结合随机过采样、EDA和焦点损失等数据平衡策略。

Result: 实验表明EDA有效缓解类别不平衡，显著提升准确率和F1分数；结合焦点损失和过采样进一步增强了模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究为食品危害检测提供了更有效的NLP分类模型，尤其适用于难分类样本。

Abstract: Classification tasks often suffer from imbal- anced data distribution, which
presents chal- lenges in food hazard detection due to severe class imbalances,
short and unstructured text, and overlapping semantic categories. In this
paper, we present our system for SemEval- 2025 Task 9: Food Hazard Detection,
which ad- dresses these issues by applying data augmenta- tion techniques to
improve classification perfor- mance. We utilize transformer-based models, BERT
and RoBERTa, as backbone classifiers and explore various data balancing
strategies, including random oversampling, Easy Data Augmentation (EDA), and
focal loss. Our ex- periments show that EDA effectively mitigates class
imbalance, leading to significant improve- ments in accuracy and F1 scores.
Furthermore, combining focal loss with oversampling and EDA further enhances
model robustness, par- ticularly for hard-to-classify examples. These findings
contribute to the development of more effective NLP-based classification models
for food hazard detection.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合启发式和模型过滤技术的德语数据集构建流程，并生成合成数据，显著提升了大型语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据质量对大型语言模型（LLMs）的性能和训练效率有重要影响，但德语领域的高质量数据集稀缺。

Method: 采用启发式和模型过滤技术，结合合成数据生成，构建了Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb数据集。

Result: 在德语基准测试中，Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb表现优于FineWeb2，甚至在8B规模下优于增强版FineWeb2。

Conclusion: 模型驱动的数据筛选和合成数据生成能显著提升LLM预训练数据集的质量。

Abstract: Scaling data quantity is essential for large language models (LLMs), yet
recent findings show that data quality can significantly boost performance and
training efficiency. We introduce a German-language dataset curation pipeline
that combines heuristic and model-based filtering techniques with synthetic
data generation. We use our pipeline to create Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb, a
large-scale German pre-training dataset which draws from: (1) Common Crawl web
data, (2) FineWeb2, and (3) synthetically-generated data conditioned on actual,
organic web data. We evaluate our dataset by pre-training both a 1B Llama-style
model and an 8B tokenizer-free hierarchical autoregressive transformer (HAT). A
comparison on German-language benchmarks, including MMMLU, shows significant
performance gains of Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb over FineWeb2 alone. This advantage
holds at the 8B scale even when FineWeb2 is enriched by human-curated
high-quality data sources such as Wikipedia. Our findings support the growing
body of evidence that model-based data curation and synthetic data generation
can significantly enhance LLM pre-training datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出Context Organizer (CORG)框架，用于处理文档中知识重复与不一致的问题，通过分组处理上下文，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实语料库中知识重复但存在不一致性，现有语言模型难以处理复杂上下文关系。

Method: CORG框架包含图构造器、重排序器和聚合器，将上下文分组独立处理。

Result: CORG在性能与效率间取得平衡，优于现有分组方法，接近计算密集型单上下文方法。

Conclusion: CORG有效解决多上下文关系问题，为知识处理提供新思路。

Abstract: In a real-world corpus, knowledge frequently recurs across documents but
often contains inconsistencies due to ambiguous naming, outdated information,
or errors, leading to complex interrelationships between contexts. Previous
research has shown that language models struggle with these complexities,
typically focusing on single factors in isolation. We classify these
relationships into four types: distracting, ambiguous, counterfactual, and
duplicated. Our analysis reveals that no single approach effectively addresses
all these interrelationships simultaneously. Therefore, we introduce Context
Organizer (CORG), a framework that organizes multiple contexts into
independently processed groups. This design allows the model to efficiently
find all relevant answers while ensuring disambiguation. CORG consists of three
key components: a graph constructor, a reranker, and an aggregator. Our results
demonstrate that CORG balances performance and efficiency effectively,
outperforming existing grouping methods and achieving comparable results to
more computationally intensive, single-context approaches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1，通过二进制奖励优化工具调用，无需标注推理轨迹，在BFCL和API-Bank基准测试中表现优于GPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在增强语言模型工具使用能力时，要么忽略推理，要么生成模仿性推理，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 采用类似DeepSeek-R1的规则强化学习范式，仅通过评估工具调用的结构有效性和功能正确性进行优化。

Result: Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1-7B和14B在BFCL和API-Bank基准测试中达到最优，超越GPT-4o。

Conclusion: 轻量级监督方法能有效提升模型工具使用能力，无需依赖标注推理轨迹。

Abstract: Enabling large language models with external tools has become a pivotal
strategy for extending their functionality beyond text generation tasks. Prior
work typically enhances tool-use abilities by either applying supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) to enforce tool-call correctness or distilling reasoning
traces from stronger models for SFT. However, both approaches fall short,
either omitting reasoning entirely or producing imitative reasoning that limits
generalization. Inspired by the success of DeepSeek-R1 in eliciting reasoning
through rule-based reinforcement learning, we develop the
Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1 series of tool-using language models using a similar
training paradigm. Instead of restrictively supervising intermediate reasoning
traces distilled from stronger models, Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1 is optimized
with a binary reward that evaluates only the structural validity and functional
correctness of tool invocations. This lightweight supervision allows the model
to autonomously internalize reasoning strategies, without the need for
annotated reasoning trajectories. Experiments on the BFCL and API-Bank
benchmarks show that Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1-7B and
Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1-14B, built on Qwen-2.5-7B/14B-Instruct, achieve
state-of-the-art results, outperforming GPT-4o on both evaluations.

Motivation: 尽管基础模型在通用任务中表现出色，但在医疗场景中面临专业知识壁垒、计算资源需求和部署环境限制等挑战。

Method: 设计了从教师模型到学生模型的知识转移管道，采用LoRA技术调整关键注意力层；实施4位权重量化等压缩技术；集成Flash Attention加速和连续批处理等推理优化技术。

Result: 在医疗问答数据集上，该方法在保持专业准确性的同时，内存消耗减少64.7%，推理延迟降低12.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法为医疗大模型在资源受限环境（如边缘计算设备）中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, despite foundation models like DeepSeek-R1 and ChatGPT
demonstrating significant capabilities in general tasks, professional knowledge
barriers, computational resource requirements, and deployment environment
limitations have severely hindered their application in actual medical
scenarios. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient
lightweight medical vertical large language model architecture method,
systematically solving the lightweight problem of medical large models from
three dimensions: knowledge acquisition, model compression, and computational
optimization. At the knowledge acquisition level, a knowledge transfer pipeline
is designed from the fine-tuned DeepSeek-R1-Distill-70B teacher model to the
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B student model, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technology
is adopted to precisely adjust key attention layers. At the model compression
level, compression techniques including 4-bit weight quantization are
implemented while preserving the core representation ability for medical
reasoning. At the computational optimization level, inference optimization
techniques such as Flash Attention acceleration and continuous batching are
integrated, and a professional prompt template system is constructed to adapt
to different types of medical problems. Experimental results on medical
question-answering datasets show that the method proposed in this paper
maintains professional accuracy while reducing memory consumption by 64.7\% and
inference latency by 12.4\%, providing an effective solution for the
application of medical large models in resource-constrained environments such
as edge computing devices.

TL;DR: 提出一种从文本中自动发现主语、动作、宾语和状语维度的方法，支持高效文本操作和自然语言查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过结构化文本维度，提升自然语言查询的效率和精确性。

Method: 构建高质量、独立且表达能力强的树结构，表示文本中的主语、动作、宾语和状语及其子类关系。

Result: 实验显示抽象树的平均精确率、召回率和F1分数均超过80%，支持快速搜索和精确定位目标句子。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效支持自然语言查询，覆盖多种问题模式，并显著减少搜索空间。

Abstract: This paper proposed an approach to automatically discovering subject
dimension, action dimension, object dimension and adverbial dimension from
texts to efficiently operate texts and support query in natural language. The
high quality of trees guarantees that all subjects, actions, objects and
adverbials and their subclass relations within texts can be represented. The
independency of trees ensures that there is no redundant representation between
trees. The expressiveness of trees ensures that the majority of sentences can
be accessed from each tree and the rest of sentences can be accessed from at
least one tree so that the tree-based search mechanism can support querying in
natural language. Experiments show that the average precision, recall and
F1-score of the abstraction trees constructed by the subclass relations of
subject, action, object and adverbial are all greater than 80%. The application
of the proposed approach to supporting query in natural language demonstrates
that different types of question patterns for querying subject or object have
high coverage of texts, and searching multiple trees on subject, action, object
and adverbial according to the question pattern can quickly reduce search space
to locate target sentences, which can support precise operation on texts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端到端语音对话系统在整合外部知识时的模态鸿沟问题，避免中间语音转文本步骤。

Method: 采用端到端RAG框架，直接从语音查询中检索文本知识，无需ASR转换。

Result: 显著提升系统性能，检索效率更高，但整体性能仍低于级联模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为端到端S2S系统的知识整合提供了有前景的方向，代码和数据集将开源以促进研究。

Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end speech-to-speech (S2S) dialogue systems have
garnered increasing research attention due to their advantages over traditional
cascaded systems, including achieving lower latency and more natural
integration of nonverbal cues such as emotion and speaker identity. However,
these end-to-end systems face key challenges, particularly in incorporating
external knowledge, a capability commonly addressed by Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) in text-based large language models (LLMs). The core
difficulty lies in the modality gap between input speech and retrieved textual
knowledge, which hinders effective integration. To address this issue, we
propose a novel end-to-end RAG framework that directly retrieves relevant
textual knowledge from speech queries, eliminating the need for intermediate
speech-to-text conversion via techniques like ASR. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of
end-to-end S2S dialogue systems while achieving higher retrieval efficiency.
Although the overall performance still lags behind cascaded models, our
framework offers a promising direction for enhancing knowledge integration in
end-to-end S2S systems. We will release the code and dataset to support
reproducibility and promote further research in this area.

Motivation: 解决大型视觉语言模型在融入专业领域知识时容易遗忘基础视觉语言能力的问题。

Method: 采用三阶段对话结构：基础保留（caption任务）、对比消歧（反事实示例）、知识专业化（链式推理）。

Result: 实验证明SDFT在多个领域能平衡专业知识获取与通用能力保留。

Conclusion: SDFT提供了一种数据中心的对话模板，成功平衡基础对齐与知识集成。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models have demonstrated impressive versatile
capabilities through extensive multimodal pre-training, but face significant
limitations when incorporating specialized knowledge domains beyond their
training distribution. These models struggle with a fundamental dilemma: direct
adaptation approaches that inject domain-specific knowledge often trigger
catastrophic forgetting of foundational visual-linguistic abilities. We
introduce Structured Dialogue Fine-Tuning (SDFT), an effective approach that
effectively injects domain-specific knowledge while minimizing catastrophic
forgetting. Drawing inspiration from supervised fine-tuning in LLMs and
subject-driven personalization in text-to-image diffusion models, our method
employs a three-phase dialogue structure: Foundation Preservation reinforces
pre-trained visual-linguistic alignment through caption tasks; Contrastive
Disambiguation introduces carefully designed counterfactual examples to
maintain semantic boundaries; and Knowledge Specialization embeds specialized
information through chain-of-thought reasoning. Experimental results across
multiple domains confirm SDFT's effectiveness in balancing specialized
knowledge acquisition with general capability retention. Our key contributions
include a data-centric dialogue template that balances foundational alignment
with targeted knowledge integration, a weighted multi-turn supervision
framework, and comprehensive evaluation across diverse knowledge types.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型在模拟历史文本风格时的局限性，避免时代错误。

Method: 通过提示和微调当代模型，比较其输出与真实历史文本的差异。

Result: 微调模型能欺骗自动化评估，但人类仍能区分其输出与真实历史文本。

Conclusion: 预训练历史文本可能是可靠模拟历史视角的必要条件。

Abstract: Before researchers can use language models to simulate the past, they need to
understand the risk of anachronism. We find that prompting a contemporary model
with examples of period prose does not produce output consistent with period
style. Fine-tuning produces results that are stylistically convincing enough to
fool an automated judge, but human evaluators can still distinguish fine-tuned
model outputs from authentic historical text. We tentatively conclude that
pretraining on period prose may be required in order to reliably simulate
historical perspectives for social research.

Result: LEPA在多个自然语言推理基准上显著优于传统算法。

Conclusion: LEPA通过提取和利用预测性计划，有效提升大语言模型的泛化能力和问题解决效率。

Abstract: In the field of large language model (LLM) post-training, the effectiveness
of utilizing synthetic data generated by the LLM itself has been
well-presented. However, a key question remains unaddressed: what essential
information should such self-generated data encapsulate? Existing approaches
only produce step-by-step problem solutions, and fail to capture the abstract
meta-knowledge necessary for generalization across similar problems. Drawing
insights from cognitive science, where humans employ high-level abstraction to
simplify complex problems before delving into specifics, we introduce a novel
self-training algorithm: LEarning to Plan before Answering (LEPA). LEPA trains
the LLM to formulate anticipatory plans, which serve as abstract meta-knowledge
for problem-solving, before engaging with the intricacies of problems. This
approach not only outlines the solution generation path but also shields the
LLM from the distraction of irrelevant details. During data generation, LEPA
first crafts an anticipatory plan based on the problem, and then generates a
solution that aligns with both the plan and the problem. LEPA refines the plan
through self-reflection, aiming to acquire plans that are instrumental in
yielding correct solutions. During model optimization, the LLM is trained to
predict both the refined plans and the corresponding solutions. By efficiently
extracting and utilizing the anticipatory plans, LEPA demonstrates remarkable
superiority over conventional algorithms on various challenging natural
language reasoning benchmarks.

Motivation: 全球抑郁症患者超过3亿，但医疗资源分布不均和诊断方法复杂导致许多地区对该病的关注不足。

Method: 从UK Biobank队列中选取274,348条个体记录，设计表格数据转换方法，训练和评估MDD-LLM模型。

Result: MDD-LLM（70B）的准确率为0.8378，AUC为0.8919，显著优于现有机器学习框架。

Conclusion: MDD-LLM为抑郁症诊断提供了高效解决方案，并探讨了影响性能的关键因素。

Abstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD) impacts more than 300 million people
worldwide, highlighting a significant public health issue. However, the uneven
distribution of medical resources and the complexity of diagnostic methods have
resulted in inadequate attention to this disorder in numerous countries and
regions. This paper introduces a high-performance MDD diagnosis tool named
MDD-LLM, an AI-driven framework that utilizes fine-tuned large language models
(LLMs) and extensive real-world samples to tackle challenges in MDD diagnosis.
Therefore, we select 274,348 individual information from the UK Biobank cohort
to train and evaluate the proposed method. Specifically, we select 274,348
individual records from the UK Biobank cohort and design a tabular data
transformation method to create a large corpus for training and evaluating the
proposed approach. To illustrate the advantages of MDD-LLM, we perform
comprehensive experiments and provide several comparative analyses against
existing model-based solutions across multiple evaluation metrics. Experimental
results show that MDD-LLM (70B) achieves an accuracy of 0.8378 and an AUC of
0.8919 (95% CI: 0.8799 - 0.9040), significantly outperforming existing machine
learning and deep learning frameworks for MDD diagnosis. Given the limited
exploration of LLMs in MDD diagnosis, we examine numerous factors that may
influence the performance of our proposed method, such as tabular data
transformation techniques and different fine-tuning strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制的二次计算复杂度限制了Transformer的可扩展性，因此需要一种更高效的替代方法。

Method: 结合时域（嵌入重建）和频域（短时傅里叶变换幅度匹配）的重建损失，以及高斯混合模型（GMM）先验，学习全局傅里叶字典和混合系数。

Result: 在WikiText2和Penn Treebank等基准测试中，取得了与Transformer基线竞争的性能，同时显著降低了推理延迟和内存占用。

Conclusion: 谱字典模型为可扩展语言建模提供了一种高效且性能优越的替代方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel spectral generative modeling framework for natural
language processing that jointly learns a global time varying Fourier
dictionary and per token mixing coefficients, replacing the ubiquitous self
attention mechanism in transformer architectures. By enforcing reconstruction
losses in both the time domain (embedding reconstruction) and the frequency
domain (via Short Time Fourier Transform magnitude matching) alongside a
standard language modeling objective, and fitting a Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) prior over the learned mixing vectors, our approach achieves competitive
perplexity and generation quality on standard benchmarks such as WikiText2 and
Penn Treebank. In contrast to the quadratic computation complexity of self
attention, our method operates with linear complexity, delivering substantial
efficiency gains. We demonstrate that spectral dictionary models can achieve
competitive performance compared to transformer baselines while significantly
reducing inference latency and memory footprint, offering a compelling
alternative for scalable language modeling.

Conclusion: 小型LLMs通过优化方法可在钓鱼邮件检测中达到高性能，降低计算成本。

Abstract: Large language models(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on many
natural language processing(NLP) tasks and have been employed in phishing email
detection research. However, in current studies, well-performing LLMs typically
contain billions or even tens of billions of parameters, requiring enormous
computational resources. To reduce computational costs, we investigated the
effectiveness of small-parameter LLMs for phishing email detection. These LLMs
have around 3 billion parameters and can run on consumer-grade GPUs. However,
small LLMs often perform poorly in phishing email detection task. To address
these issues, we designed a set of methods including Prompt Engineering,
Explanation Augmented Fine-tuning, and Model Ensemble to improve phishing email
detection capabilities of small LLMs. We validated the effectiveness of our
approach through experiments, significantly improving accuracy on the
SpamAssassin dataset from around 0.5 for baseline models like

(1980-2020), we employ natural language processing techniques to quantify
multiple dimensions of lyrical complexity. Our analysis reveals a 23.7%
increase in vocabulary diversity over the study period, with East Coast artists
demonstrating 17.3% higher lexical variation than other regions. Rhyme density
increased by 34.2% across all regions, with Midwest artists exhibiting the
highest technical complexity (3.04 rhymes per line). Topic modeling identified
significant shifts in thematic content, with social justice themes decreasing
from 28.5% to 13.8% of content while introspective themes increased from 7.6%
to 26.3%. Sentiment analysis demon- strated that lyrics became significantly
more negative during sociopolitical crises, with polarity decreasing by 0.31
following major social unrest. Multi-dimensional analysis revealed four dis-
tinct stylistic approaches that correlate strongly with geographic origin
(r=0.68, p!0.001) and time period (r=0.59, p<0.001). These findings establish
quantitative evidence for the evolution of hip- hop as both an art form and a
reflection of societal dynamics, providing insights into the interplay between
linguistic innovation and cultural context in popular music.

### [32] [A Framework to Assess the Persuasion Risks Large Language Model Chatbots Pose to Democratic Societies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00036)
*Zhongren Chen,Joshua Kalla,Quan Le,Shinpei Nakamura-Sakai,Jasjeet Sekhon,Ruixiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在政治说服中的成本效益，发现其与传统竞选方法相比成本更低，但可扩展性较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在民主社会中的潜在威胁，特别是其说服能力是否比传统政治竞选方法更高效。

Method: 通过两项调查实验（N=10,417）和真实世界模拟，比较LLMs与传统竞选方法的说服效果和成本。

Result: LLMs的说服成本（每说服一名选民48-74美元）低于传统方法（100美元），但可扩展性较差。

Conclusion: 目前LLMs的大规模政治说服潜力有限，但随着技术发展，其潜力可能提升。

Abstract: In recent years, significant concern has emerged regarding the potential
threat that Large Language Models (LLMs) pose to democratic societies through
their persuasive capabilities. We expand upon existing research by conducting
two survey experiments and a real-world simulation exercise to determine
whether it is more cost effective to persuade a large number of voters using
LLM chatbots compared to standard political campaign practice, taking into
account both the "receive" and "accept" steps in the persuasion process (Zaller
1992). These experiments improve upon previous work by assessing extended
interactions between humans and LLMs (instead of using single-shot
interactions) and by assessing both short- and long-run persuasive effects
(rather than simply asking users to rate the persuasiveness of LLM-produced
content). In two survey experiments (N = 10,417) across three distinct
political domains, we find that while LLMs are about as persuasive as actual
campaign ads once voters are exposed to them, political persuasion in the
real-world depends on both exposure to a persuasive message and its impact
conditional on exposure. Through simulations based on real-world parameters, we
estimate that LLM-based persuasion costs between \$48-\$74 per persuaded voter
compared to \$100 for traditional campaign methods, when accounting for the
costs of exposure. However, it is currently much easier to scale traditional
campaign persuasion methods than LLM-based persuasion. While LLMs do not
currently appear to have substantially greater potential for large-scale
political persuasion than existing non-LLM methods, this may change as LLM
capabilities continue to improve and it becomes easier to scalably encourage
exposure to persuasive LLMs.

*Cristina Garbacea,Chenhao Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于假设驱动的个性化方法（HyPerAlign），通过少量用户示例推断其偏好和风格，从而生成定制化输出，优于传统的基于偏好的微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型（LLM）通常针对“平均用户”偏好进行对齐，但实际使用中用户需求多样且具体，需要个性化控制。

Method: 提出HyPerAlign方法，通过少量用户示例推断其沟通策略、个性和写作风格，并基于这些假设生成定制化输出。

Result: 在作者归属和审议对齐任务中，HyPerAlign显著优于传统方法，帮助性提升高达70%，作者归属任务胜率超过90%。

Conclusion: HyPerAlign是一种高效且可解释的个性化策略，适用于LLM的定制化需求。

Abstract: Alignment algorithms are widely used to align large language models (LLMs) to
human users based on preference annotations that reflect their intended
real-world use cases. Typically these (often divergent) preferences are
aggregated over a diverse set of users, resulting in fine-tuned models that are
aligned to the ``average-user'' preference. Nevertheless, current models are
used by individual users in very specific contexts and situations, emphasizing
the need for user-dependent preference control. In this work we address the
problem of personalizing LLM outputs to their users, aiming to generate
customized responses tailored to individual users, instead of generic outputs
that emulate the collective voices of diverse populations. We propose a novel
interpretable and sample-efficient hypotheses-driven personalization approach
(HyPerAlign) where given few-shot examples written by a particular user, we
first infer hypotheses about their communication strategies, personality and
writing style, then prompt LLM models with these hypotheses and user specific
attributes to generate customized outputs. We conduct experiments on two
different personalization tasks, authorship attribution and deliberative
alignment, with datasets from diverse domains (news articles, blog posts,
emails, jailbreaking benchmarks), and demonstrate the superiority of
hypotheses-driven personalization approach when compared to preference-based
fine-tuning methods. For deliberative alignment, the helpfulness of LLM models
is improved by up to $70\%$ on average. For authorship attribution, results
indicate consistently high win-rates (commonly $>90\%$) against
state-of-the-art preference fine-tuning approaches for LLM personalization
across diverse user profiles and LLM models. Overall, our approach represents
an interpretable and sample-efficient strategy for the personalization of LLM
models to individual users.

Motivation: 法律规范具有层次结构、内外引用网络和多时间版本，传统方法难以处理其复杂性。

Method: 通过将层次结构和时间演化整合到知识图谱中，结合文本单元，构建更丰富的法律知识表示。

Result: Graph RAG在法律规范数据集上的应用显著提升了AI在法律领域的表现。

Conclusion: 该方法为法律研究、立法分析和决策支持提供了更有效的工具，推动了AI在法律领域的应用。

Abstract: This article proposes an adaptation of Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation
(Graph RAG) specifically designed for the analysis and comprehension of legal
norms, which are characterized by their predefined hierarchical structure,
extensive network of internal and external references and multiple temporal
versions. By combining structured knowledge graphs with contextually enriched
text segments, Graph RAG offers a promising solution to address the inherent
complexity and vast volume of legal data. The integration of hierarchical
structure and temporal evolution into knowledge graphs - along with the concept
of comprehensive Text Units - facilitates the construction of richer,
interconnected representations of legal knowledge. Through a detailed analysis
of Graph RAG and its application to legal norm datasets, this article aims to
significantly advance the field of Artificial Intelligence applied to Law,
creating opportunities for more effective systems in legal research,
legislative analysis, and decision support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨对齐技术是否适用于所有任务，揭示其在某些场景中的局限性。

Method: 通过随机数生成、混合策略游戏和创意写作等任务，比较基础模型和对齐模型的性能。

Result: 对齐模型在需要不可预测输出的任务中表现较差，倾向于生成狭窄或可预测的行为。

Conclusion: 对齐技术并非适用于所有任务，需根据具体需求权衡其应用。

Abstract: Alignment has quickly become a default ingredient in LLM development, with
techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback making models act
safely, follow instructions, and perform ever-better on complex tasks. While
these techniques are certainly useful, we propose that they should not be
universally applied and demonstrate a range of tasks on which base language
models consistently outperform their popular aligned forms. Particularly, we
study tasks that require unpredictable outputs, such as random number
generation, mixed strategy games (rock-paper-scissors and hide-and-seek), and
creative writing. In each case, aligned models tend towards narrow behaviors
that result in distinct disadvantages, for instance, preferring to generate "7"
over other uniformly random numbers, becoming almost fully predictable in some
game states, or prioritizing pleasant writing over creative originality. Across
models tested, better performance on common benchmarks tends to correlate with
worse performance on our tasks, suggesting an effective trade-off in the
required capabilities.

Motivation: 探索社交媒体情感分析在预测时尚趋势中的应用价值。

Method: 使用T4SA数据集，结合自然语言处理和机器学习技术，包括情感分类、时间序列分解、因果建模和跨平台比较。

Result: 情感模式与时尚主题流行度相关，配饰和街头服饰趋势显著；Granger因果分析显示可持续性和街头服饰为主要驱动因素。

Conclusion: 社交媒体情感分析可作为时尚趋势的早期指标，改进的预测模型在情感分类中达到78.35%的平衡准确率。

Abstract: This study explores the intersection of fashion trends and social media
sentiment through computational analysis of Twitter data using the T4SA
(Twitter for Sentiment Analysis) dataset. By applying natural language
processing and machine learning techniques, we examine how sentiment patterns
in fashion-related social media conversations can serve as predictors for
emerging fashion trends. Our analysis involves the identification and
categorization of fashion-related content, sentiment classification with
improved normalization techniques, time series decomposition, statistically
validated causal relationship modeling, cross-platform sentiment comparison,
and brand-specific sentiment analysis. Results indicate correlations between
sentiment patterns and fashion theme popularity, with accessories and
streetwear themes showing statistically significant rising trends. The Granger
causality analysis establishes sustainability and streetwear as primary trend
drivers, showing bidirectional relationships with several other themes. The
findings demonstrate that social media sentiment analysis can serve as an
effective early indicator of fashion trend trajectories when proper statistical
validation is applied. Our improved predictive model achieved 78.35% balanced
accuracy in sentiment classification, establishing a reliable foundation for
trend prediction across positive, neutral, and negative sentiment categories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络迷因聚类对毒性检测、传播建模和分类至关重要，但现有方法依赖数据库且忽视语义，难以处理多样化的相似性维度。

Method: 采用模板匹配和多维相似性特征（如形式、视觉内容、文本和身份），结合局部和全局特征进行聚类。

Result: 新方法优于现有聚类方法，生成更一致和连贯的聚类，且特征集支持自适应匹配。

Conclusion: 该方法无需预定义数据库，支持自适应匹配，代码已开源以促进后续研究。

Abstract: Meme clustering is critical for toxicity detection, virality modeling, and
typing, but it has received little attention in previous research. Clustering
similar Internet memes is challenging due to their multimodality, cultural
context, and adaptability. Existing approaches rely on databases, overlook
semantics, and struggle to handle diverse dimensions of similarity. This paper
introduces a novel method that uses template-based matching with
multi-dimensional similarity features, thus eliminating the need for predefined
databases and supporting adaptive matching. Memes are clustered using local and
global features across similarity categories such as form, visual content,
text, and identity. Our combined approach outperforms existing clustering
methods, producing more consistent and coherent clusters, while
similarity-based feature sets enable adaptability and align with human
intuition. We make all supporting code publicly available to support subsequent
research. Code: https://github.com/tygobl/meme-clustering

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ASR在许多指标上接近人类水平，但在复杂现实场景（如远距离语音）中表现不佳。BERSt数据集旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 收集了98名演员在不同家庭环境中的语音数据，涵盖多种口音、情绪和距离条件，使用智能手机录制。

Result: ASR性能随距离和喊叫程度下降，且受情绪影响；SER任务也面临挑战。

Conclusion: BERSt数据集为语音识别任务提供了新的挑战，需进一步研究以提高系统在现实中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Some speech recognition tasks, such as automatic speech recognition (ASR),
are approaching or have reached human performance in many reported metrics.
Yet, they continue to struggle in complex, real-world, situations, such as with
distanced speech. Previous challenges have released datasets to address the
issue of distanced ASR, however, the focus remains primarily on distance,
specifically relying on multi-microphone array systems. Here we present the
B(asic) E(motion) R(andom phrase) S(hou)t(s) (BERSt) dataset. The dataset
contains almost 4 hours of English speech from 98 actors with varying regional
and non-native accents. The data was collected on smartphones in the actors
homes and therefore includes at least 98 different acoustic environments. The
data also includes 7 different emotion prompts and both shouted and spoken
utterances. The smartphones were places in 19 different positions, including
obstructions and being in a different room than the actor. This data is
publicly available for use and can be used to evaluate a variety of speech
recognition tasks, including: ASR, shout detection, and speech emotion
recognition (SER). We provide initial benchmarks for ASR and SER tasks, and
find that ASR degrades both with an increase in distance and shout level and
shows varied performance depending on the intended emotion. Our results show
that the BERSt dataset is challenging for both ASR and SER tasks and continued
work is needed to improve the robustness of such systems for more accurate
real-world use.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种事实一致性评估框架，用于评估LLM生成的SQL输出的语义准确性，并构建了一个特定领域的基准测试。实验结果显示，Exaone 3.5在简单任务上表现良好，但在复杂任务中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在商业智能（BI）中的应用因语义幻觉、结构错误和缺乏领域特定评估框架而受限。

Method: 使用Exaone 3.5构建了一个包含219个自然语言商业问题的基准测试，评估了模型的语义准确性。

Result: Exaone 3.5在简单聚合任务中表现良好（93%准确率），但在算术推理（4%）和分组排名任务（31%）中表现较差。

Conclusion: LLM在商业关键环境中仍有限制，需要事实一致性验证层和混合推理方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in enabling natural language
interfaces for structured data querying through text-to-SQL generation.
However, their application in real-world Business Intelligence (BI) contexts
remains limited due to semantic hallucinations, structural errors, and a lack
of domain-specific evaluation frameworks. In this study, we propose a
Fact-Consistency Evaluation Framework for assessing the semantic accuracy of
LLM-generated SQL outputs using Exaone 3.5--an instruction-tuned, bilingual LLM
optimized for enterprise tasks. We construct a domain-specific benchmark
comprising 219 natural language business questions across five SQL complexity
levels, derived from actual sales data in LG Electronics' internal BigQuery
environment. Each question is paired with a gold-standard SQL query and a
validated ground-truth answer. We evaluate model performance using answer
accuracy, execution success rate, semantic error rate, and non-response rate.
Experimental results show that while Exaone 3.5 performs well on simple
aggregation tasks (93% accuracy in L1), it exhibits substantial degradation in
arithmetic reasoning (4% accuracy in H1) and grouped ranking tasks (31% in H4),
with semantic errors and non-responses concentrated in complex cases.
Qualitative error analysis further identifies common failure types such as
misapplied arithmetic logic, incomplete filtering, and incorrect grouping
operations. Our findings highlight the current limitations of LLMs in
business-critical environments and underscore the need for fact-consistency
validation layers and hybrid reasoning approaches. This work contributes a
reproducible benchmark and evaluation methodology for advancing reliable
natural language interfaces to structured enterprise data systems.

Method: 识别三种操纵策略，采用对抗性训练和集成技术（如多数投票和岭回归）提升系统防御能力，并利用GPT-4等大语言模型优化评分。

Result: 对抗性训练显著降低系统被操纵的脆弱性，集成技术和大语言模型进一步提升了系统的防御能力。

Conclusion: 强调持续改进AI教育工具的必要性，以应对高风险场景中的挑战。

Abstract: This study examines vulnerabilities in transformer-based automated
short-answer grading systems used in medical education, with a focus on how
these systems can be manipulated through adversarial gaming strategies. Our
research identifies three main types of gaming strategies that exploit the
system's weaknesses, potentially leading to false positives. To counteract
these vulnerabilities, we implement several adversarial training methods
designed to enhance the systems' robustness. Our results indicate that these
methods significantly reduce the susceptibility of grading systems to such
manipulations, especially when combined with ensemble techniques like majority
voting and ridge regression, which further improve the system's defense against
sophisticated adversarial inputs. Additionally, employing large language models
such as GPT-4 with varied prompting techniques has shown promise in recognizing
and scoring gaming strategies effectively. The findings underscore the
importance of continuous improvements in AI-driven educational tools to ensure
their reliability and fairness in high-stakes settings.

Result: GDI模型在多个基准测试中表现最佳，GPT-4o在推理任务中表现优异但视觉能力有限。

Conclusion: GDI-Bench和GDI模型为文档智能领域提供了有效的评估工具和优化方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
profoundly impacted the document domain, creating a wide array of application
scenarios. This progress highlights the need for a comprehensive benchmark to
evaluate these models' capabilities across various document-specific tasks.
However, existing benchmarks often fail to locate specific model weaknesses or
guide systematic improvements. To bridge this gap, we introduce a General
Document Intelligence Benchmark (GDI-Bench), featuring 1.9k images across 9 key
scenarios and 19 document-specific tasks. By decoupling visual complexity and
reasoning complexity, the GDI-Bench structures graded tasks that allow
performance assessment by difficulty, aiding in model weakness identification
and optimization guidance. We evaluate the GDI-Bench on various open-source and
closed-source models, conducting decoupled analyses in the visual and reasoning
domains. For instance, the GPT-4o model excels in reasoning tasks but exhibits
limitations in visual capabilities. To address the diverse tasks and domains in
the GDI-Bench, we propose a GDI Model that mitigates the issue of catastrophic
forgetting during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) process through a
intelligence-preserving training strategy. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance on previous benchmarks and the GDI-Bench. Both our benchmark and
model will be open source.

Result: 实验证明该指标能有效识别答案是否基于上下文，且计算高效、可解释。

Conclusion: 该指标为开放书问答系统提供了一种可扩展且实用的上下文利用评估方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable success in
open-book question answering (QA), where the task requires generating answers
grounded in a provided external context. A critical challenge in open-book QA
is to ensure that model responses are based on the provided context rather than
its parametric knowledge, which can be outdated, incomplete, or incorrect.
Existing evaluation methods, primarily based on the LLM-as-a-judge approach,
face significant limitations, including biases, scalability issues, and
dependence on costly external systems. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel metric that contrasts the perplexity of the model response under two
conditions: when the context is provided and when it is not. The resulting
score quantifies the extent to which the model's answer relies on the provided
context. The validity of this metric is demonstrated through a series of
experiments that show its effectiveness in identifying whether a given answer
is grounded in the provided context. Unlike existing approaches, this metric is
computationally efficient, interpretable, and adaptable to various use cases,
offering a scalable and practical solution to assess context utilization in
open-book QA systems.

Motivation: 探讨文化真实性数据在方言翻译中的重要性，挑战“数据越多越好”的范式。

Method: 比较了三种微调方法（基础、对比和语法提示微调），使用开源Aya23模型，并引入LebEval新基准。

Result: 文化感知的小数据集（LW）表现优于大规模非本地数据，对比微调结合对比提示效果最佳。

Conclusion: 文化真实性在方言翻译中至关重要，挑战了传统数据规模优先的观点。

Abstract: This paper examines the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
translating the low-resource Lebanese dialect, focusing on the impact of
culturally authentic data versus larger translated datasets. We compare three
fine-tuning approaches: Basic, contrastive, and grammar-hint tuning, using
open-source Aya23 models. Experiments reveal that models fine-tuned on a
smaller but culturally aware Lebanese dataset (LW) consistently outperform
those trained on larger, non-native data. The best results were achieved
through contrastive fine-tuning paired with contrastive prompting, which
indicates the benefits of exposing translation models to bad examples. In
addition, to ensure authentic evaluation, we introduce LebEval, a new benchmark
derived from native Lebanese content, and compare it to the existing FLoRes
benchmark. Our findings challenge the "More Data is Better" paradigm and
emphasize the crucial role of cultural authenticity in dialectal translation.
We made our datasets and code available on Github.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs的推理长度与答案正确性之间的关系，揭示模型在问题难度判断和响应长度校准上的不足。

Method: 通过系统性实证研究分析推理长度与答案正确性的关系，并利用偏好优化算法减少生成长度。

Result: LLMs在简单问题上过度推理，复杂问题上推理不足；通过长度优化可减少输出长度且保持准确性。

Conclusion: 生成长度是推理行为的重要信号，需进一步探索LLMs在推理长度适应上的自我意识。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly optimized for long reasoning,
under the assumption that more reasoning leads to better performance. However,
emerging evidence suggests that longer responses can sometimes degrade accuracy
rather than improve it. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study
of the relationship between reasoning length and answer correctness. We find
that LLMs tend to overthink simple problems, generating unnecessarily long
outputs, and underthink harder ones, failing to extend their reasoning when it
is most needed. This indicates that models might misjudge problem difficulty
and fail to calibrate their response length appropriately. Furthermore, we
investigate the effects of length reduction with a preference optimization
algorithm when simply preferring the shorter responses regardless of answer
correctness. Experiments show that the generation length can be significantly
reduced while maintaining acceptable accuracy. Our findings highlight
generation length as a meaningful signal for reasoning behavior and motivate
further exploration into LLMs' self-awareness in reasoning length adaptation.

Motivation: 现有技能策略在大语言模型（LLM）中有效，但对小语言模型（SLM）效果不佳，甚至可能因信息过载降低性能。

Method: 提出AdaptMI和AdaptMI+，基于认知负荷理论，仅在模型表现不佳时引入技能示例，并针对性补充缺失技能。

Result: 在数学基准测试中，AdaptMI+比传统技能策略提升准确率高达6%。

Conclusion: 自适应技能选择策略能有效提升SLM的ICL性能，减少认知过载。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows a language model to improve its
problem-solving capability when provided with suitable information in context.
Since the choice of in-context information can be determined based on the
problem itself, in-context learning is analogous to human learning from
teachers in a classroom. Recent works (Didolkar et al., 2024a; 2024b) show that
ICL performance can be improved by leveraging a frontier large language model's
(LLM) ability to predict required skills to solve a problem, popularly referred
to as an LLM's metacognition, and using the recommended skills to construct
necessary in-context examples. While this skill-based strategy boosts ICL
performance in larger models, its gains on small language models (SLMs) have
been minimal, highlighting a performance gap in ICL capabilities. We
investigate this gap and show that skill-based prompting can hurt SLM
performance on easy questions by introducing unnecessary information, akin to
cognitive overload. To address this, we introduce AdaptMI, an adaptive approach
to selecting skill-based in-context Math Instructions for SLMs. Inspired by
cognitive load theory from human pedagogy, our method only introduces
skill-based examples when the model performs poorly. We further propose
AdaptMI+, which adds examples targeted to the specific skills missing from the
model's responses. On 5-shot evaluations across popular math benchmarks and
five SLMs (1B--7B; Qwen, Llama), AdaptMI+ improves accuracy by up to 6% over
naive skill-based strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI方法在医学诊断中缺乏可解释性，阻碍了临床应用的推广。

Method: 结合信息追踪框架提取关键查询，使用Flan-T5模型判断事实存在，并通过分类器预测疾病。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架有望提升医学AI的可信度和实用性。

Abstract: The development of AI-based methods for analyzing radiology reports could
lead to significant advances in medical diagnosis--from improving diagnostic
accuracy to enhancing efficiency and reducing workload. However, the lack of
interpretability in these methods has hindered their adoption in clinical
settings. In this paper, we propose an interpretable-by-design framework for
classifying radiology reports. The key idea is to extract a set of most
informative queries from a large set of reports and use these queries and their
corresponding answers to predict a diagnosis. Thus, the explanation for a
prediction is, by construction, the set of selected queries and answers. We use
the Information Pursuit framework to select informative queries, the Flan-T5
model to determine if facts are present in the report, and a classifier to
predict the disease. Experiments on the MIMIC-CXR dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, highlighting its potential to enhance
trust and usability in medical AI.

Abstract: The hallmark of effective language use lies in consistency -- expressing
similar meanings in similar contexts and avoiding contradictions. While human
communication naturally demonstrates this principle, state-of-the-art language
models struggle to maintain reliable consistency across different scenarios.
This paper examines the landscape of consistency research in AI language
systems, exploring both formal consistency (including logical rule adherence)
and informal consistency (such as moral and factual coherence). We analyze
current approaches to measure aspects of consistency, identify critical
research gaps in standardization of definitions, multilingual assessment, and
methods to improve consistency. Our findings point to an urgent need for robust
benchmarks to measure and interdisciplinary approaches to ensure consistency in
the application of language models on domain-specific tasks while preserving
the utility and adaptability.

Motivation: 现有研究多基于小规模成人数据集，缺乏针对青少年认知扭曲的大规模研究。KoACD填补了这一空白，旨在推动认知扭曲检测的研究。

Method: 使用多LLM协商方法，结合认知澄清（提升文本清晰度）和认知平衡（多样化扭曲表示）生成合成数据。

Result: LLM在显性标记分类上表现良好，但在上下文推理任务中人类评估者更准确。

Conclusion: KoACD为未来认知扭曲检测研究提供了重要资源，同时揭示了LLM在复杂推理任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Cognitive distortion refers to negative thinking patterns that can lead to
mental health issues like depression and anxiety in adolescents. Previous
studies using natural language processing (NLP) have focused mainly on
small-scale adult datasets, with limited research on adolescents. This study
introduces KoACD, the first large-scale dataset of cognitive distortions in
Korean adolescents, containing 108,717 instances. We applied a multi-Large
Language Model (LLM) negotiation method to refine distortion classification and
generate synthetic data using two approaches: cognitive clarification for
textual clarity and cognitive balancing for diverse distortion representation.
Validation through LLMs and expert evaluations showed that while LLMs
classified distortions with explicit markers, they struggled with
context-dependent reasoning, where human evaluators demonstrated higher
accuracy. KoACD aims to enhance future research on cognitive distortion
detection.

<details>

Motivation: 当前无监督句子表示方法主要基于判别式模型（如BERT），而生成式模型（如GPT）由于参数规模大，相关研究较少。鉴于生成式模型在学术界和工业界的广泛应用，亟需一种高效的无监督表示框架。

Method: 提出CSE-SFP方法，利用生成式模型的结构特性，仅需单次前向传播即可完成无监督对比学习。

Result: 实验表明，CSE-SFP生成的嵌入质量更高，同时显著减少训练时间和内存消耗。此外，引入两种比率指标评估语义空间特性。

Conclusion: CSE-SFP为生成式模型的无监督句子表示提供了一种高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: As a fundamental task in Information Retrieval and Computational Linguistics,
sentence representation has profound implications for a wide range of practical
applications such as text clustering, content analysis, question-answering
systems, and web search. Recent advances in pre-trained language models (PLMs)
have driven remarkable progress in this field, particularly through
unsupervised embedding derivation methods centered on discriminative PLMs like
BERT. However, due to time and computational constraints, few efforts have
attempted to integrate unsupervised sentence representation with generative
PLMs, which typically possess much larger parameter sizes. Given that
state-of-the-art models in both academia and industry are predominantly based
on generative architectures, there is a pressing need for an efficient
unsupervised text representation framework tailored to decoder-only PLMs. To
address this concern, we propose CSE-SFP, an innovative method that exploits
the structural characteristics of generative models. Compared to existing
strategies, CSE-SFP requires only a single forward pass to perform effective
unsupervised contrastive learning. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that
CSE-SFP not only produces higher-quality embeddings but also significantly
reduces both training time and memory consumption. Furthermore, we introduce
two ratio metrics that jointly assess alignment and uniformity, thereby
providing a more robust means for evaluating the semantic spatial properties of
encoding models.

Result: 两种方法的准确率分别为80%和84%，K alpha为0.58，表明两者性能相似但可互补。

Conclusion: 两种方法的高准确率和中等一致性表明结合两者优势具有潜力。

Abstract: Identifying regulatory statements in legislation is useful for developing
metrics to measure the regulatory density and strictness of legislation. A
computational method is valuable for scaling the identification of such
statements from a growing body of EU legislation, constituting approximately
180,000 published legal acts between 1952 and 2023. Past work on extraction of
these statements varies in the permissiveness of their definitions for what
constitutes a regulatory statement. In this work, we provide a specific
definition for our purposes based on the institutional grammar tool. We develop
and compare two contrasting approaches for automatically identifying such
statements in EU legislation, one based on dependency parsing, and the other on
a transformer-based machine learning model. We found both approaches performed
similarly well with accuracies of 80% and 84% respectively and a K alpha of
0.58. The high accuracies and not exceedingly high agreement suggests potential
for combining strengths of both approaches.

grounded in supporting evidence$\unicode{x2013}$has become a critical
challenge. Existing benchmarks for hallucination detection are often
synthetically generated, narrowly focused on extractive question answering, and
fail to capture the complexity of real-world scenarios involving multi-document
contexts and full-sentence outputs. We introduce the HalluMix Benchmark, a
diverse, task-agnostic dataset that includes examples from a range of domains
and formats. Using this benchmark, we evaluate seven hallucination detection
systems$\unicode{x2013}$both open and closed
source$\unicode{x2013}$highlighting differences in performance across tasks,
document lengths, and input representations. Our analysis highlights
substantial performance disparities between short and long contexts, with
critical implications for real-world Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
implementations. Quotient Detections achieves the best overall performance,
with an accuracy of 0.82 and an F1 score of 0.84.

Abstract: The recent development of reasoning language models (RLMs) represents a novel
evolution in large language models. In particular, the recent release of
DeepSeek-R1 has generated widespread social impact and sparked enthusiasm in
the research community for exploring the explicit reasoning paradigm of
language models. However, the implementation details of the released models
have not been fully open-sourced by DeepSeek, including DeepSeek-R1-Zero,
DeepSeek-R1, and the distilled small models. As a result, many replication
studies have emerged aiming to reproduce the strong performance achieved by
DeepSeek-R1, reaching comparable performance through similar training
procedures and fully open-source data resources. These works have investigated
feasible strategies for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning
from verifiable rewards (RLVR), focusing on data preparation and method design,
yielding various valuable insights. In this report, we provide a summary of
recent replication studies to inspire future research. We primarily focus on
SFT and RLVR as two main directions, introducing the details for data
construction, method design and training procedure of current replication
studies. Moreover, we conclude key findings from the implementation details and
experimental results reported by these studies, anticipating to inspire future
research. We also discuss additional techniques of enhancing RLMs, highlighting
the potential of expanding the application scope of these models, and
discussing the challenges in development. By this survey, we aim to help
researchers and developers of RLMs stay updated with the latest advancements,
and seek to inspire new ideas to further enhance RLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在现实应用中（如医疗和法律）的幻觉问题日益突出，尽管已有对齐和指令调优的进展，但模型仍可能生成流畅但不真实的输出。理解其认知动态是未解难题。

Method: 提出Hallucination-Inducing Prompt（HIP）误导性地融合语义远距概念，以及Hallucination Quantifying Prompt（HQP）评估输出的合理性、置信度和连贯性。

Result: 实验显示HIP生成的回答比对照组更不连贯且更多幻觉，不同模型表现各异，推理导向的LLM与通用LLM有显著差异。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究幻觉脆弱性提供了可复现的测试平台，有助于开发更安全、能自我检测概念不稳定的LLM。

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) present a growing challenge
across real-world applications, from healthcare to law, where factual
reliability is essential. Despite advances in alignment and instruction tuning,
LLMs can still generate outputs that are fluent yet fundamentally untrue.
Understanding the cognitive dynamics that underlie these hallucinations remains
an open problem. In this study, we propose a prompt-based framework to
systematically trigger and quantify hallucination: a Hallucination-Inducing
Prompt (HIP), which synthetically fuses semantically distant concepts (e.g.,
periodic table of elements and tarot divination) in a misleading way, and a
Hallucination Quantifying Prompt (HQP), which scores the plausibility,
confidence, and coherence of the output. Controlled experiments across multiple
LLMs revealed that HIPs consistently produced less coherent and more
hallucinated responses than their null-fusion controls. These effects varied
across models, with reasoning-oriented LLMs showing distinct profiles from
general-purpose ones. Our framework provides a reproducible testbed for
studying hallucination vulnerability, and opens the door to developing safer,
more introspective LLMs that can detect and self-regulate the onset of
conceptual instability.

Motivation: 扩展LLMs的上下文窗口对长文本生成至关重要，但现有方法在长上下文扩展时存在性能下降问题。

Method: 利用KV缓存的能量集中在低频的特性，通过频域过滤高频分量实现高效压缩。

Result: 实验表明，FreqKV在长上下文任务中高效且有效。

Conclusion: FreqKV为LLMs的上下文窗口扩展提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Extending the context window in large language models (LLMs) is essential for
applications involving long-form content generation. However, the linear
increase in key-value (KV) cache memory requirements and the quadratic
complexity of self-attention with respect to sequence length present
significant challenges during fine-tuning and inference. Existing methods
suffer from performance degradation when extending to longer contexts. In this
work, we introduce a novel context extension method that optimizes both
fine-tuning and inference efficiency. Our method exploits a key observation: in
the frequency domain, the energy distribution of the KV cache is primarily
concentrated in low-frequency components. By filtering out the high-frequency
components, the KV cache can be effectively compressed with minimal information
loss. Building on this insight, we propose an efficient compression technique,
FreqKV, that iteratively compresses the increasing KV cache to a fixed size in
the frequency domain, applicable to both fine-tuning and inference. FreqKV
introduces no additional parameters or architectural modifications. With
minimal fine-tuning, LLMs can learn to leverage the limited cache that is
compressed in the frequency domain and extend the context window efficiently.
Experiments on various long context language modeling and understanding tasks
demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed method.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is difficult due to their huge model
size. Recent Fourier domain-based methods show potential for reducing
fine-tuning costs. We propose a block circulant matrix-based fine-tuning method
with a stable training heuristic to leverage the properties of circulant
matrices and one-dimensional Fourier transforms to reduce storage and
computation costs. Experiments show that our method uses $14\times$ less number

Result: FineScope在领域任务中表现优异，甚至超越了一些大型模型，并能通过SAE数据集恢复剪枝损失的性能。

Conclusion: FineScope提供了一种高效且鲁棒的方法，用于生成领域优化的LLM，同时展示了SAE数据集在模型优化中的潜力。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch requires significant
computational resources, driving interest in developing smaller,
domain-specific LLMs that maintain both efficiency and strong task performance.
Medium-sized models such as LLaMA, llama} have served as starting points for
domain-specific adaptation, but they often suffer from accuracy degradation
when tested on specialized datasets. We introduce FineScope, a framework for
deriving compact, domain-optimized LLMs from larger pretrained models.
FineScope leverages the Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) framework, inspired by its
ability to produce interpretable feature representations, to extract
domain-specific subsets from large datasets. We apply structured pruning with
domain-specific constraints, ensuring that the resulting pruned models retain
essential knowledge for the target domain. To further enhance performance,
these pruned models undergo self-data distillation, leveraging SAE-curated
datasets to restore key domain-specific information lost during pruning.
Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that FineScope achieves
highly competitive performance, outperforming several large-scale
state-of-the-art LLMs in domain-specific tasks. Additionally, our results show
that FineScope enables pruned models to regain a substantial portion of their
original performance when fine-tuned with SAE-curated datasets. Furthermore,
applying these datasets to fine-tune pretrained LLMs without pruning also
improves their domain-specific accuracy, highlighting the robustness of our
approach. The code will be released.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何通过调整输入编码中的令牌提示，帮助大型语言模型（LLMs）更可靠地区分不同角色（如系统指令和用户查询），而非依赖表面代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保LLMs能准确区分不同角色的消息（角色分离）对多角色行为的一致性至关重要，但现有方法可能仅记忆已知触发器而非真正学习区分。

Method: 通过简单、受控的实验框架，发现微调模型依赖任务类型和文本起始位置作为代理；提出通过调整位置ID等令牌提示强化角色边界信号。

Result: 调整令牌提示（如位置ID）帮助模型更清晰地区分角色，减少对表面代理的依赖。

Conclusion: 通过机制中心视角，研究为LLMs在多角色行为中提供更可靠的解决方案，避免仅记忆已知触发器。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) that integrate multiple input roles (e.g.,
system instructions, user queries, external tool outputs) are increasingly
prevalent in practice. Ensuring that the model accurately distinguishes
messages from each role -- a concept we call \emph{role separation} -- is
crucial for consistent multi-role behavior. Although recent work often targets
state-of-the-art prompt injection defenses, it remains unclear whether such
methods truly teach LLMs to differentiate roles or merely memorize known
triggers. In this paper, we examine \emph{role-separation learning}: the
process of teaching LLMs to robustly distinguish system and user tokens.
Through a \emph{simple, controlled experimental framework}, we find that
fine-tuned models often rely on two proxies for role identification: (1) task
type exploitation, and (2) proximity to begin-of-text. Although data
augmentation can partially mitigate these shortcuts, it generally leads to
iterative patching rather than a deeper fix. To address this, we propose
reinforcing \emph{invariant signals} that mark role boundaries by adjusting
token-wise cues in the model's input encoding. In particular, manipulating
position IDs helps the model learn clearer distinctions and reduces reliance on
superficial proxies. By focusing on this mechanism-centered perspective, our
work illuminates how LLMs can more reliably maintain consistent multi-role
behavior without merely memorizing known prompts or triggers.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否具备真正的理解能力，回应关于其对话能力的争论。

Method: 采用思想实验和半正式分析，揭示LLMs的歧义障碍。

Result: 发现LLMs因歧义障碍无法真正理解对话内容。

Conclusion: LLMs的流畅对话能力不代表其具备真正的理解能力。

Abstract: A lively ongoing debate is taking place, since the extraordinary emergence of
Large Language Models (LLMs) with regards to their capability to understand the
world and capture the meaning of the dialogues in which they are involved.
Arguments and counter-arguments have been proposed based upon thought
experiments, anecdotal conversations between LLMs and humans, statistical
linguistic analysis, philosophical considerations, and more. In this brief
paper we present a counter-argument based upon a thought experiment and
semi-formal considerations leading to an inherent ambiguity barrier which
prevents LLMs from having any understanding of what their amazingly fluent
dialogues mean.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在微调和上下文学习中的泛化差异，以解决模型在实际应用中的泛化不足问题。

Method: 构建新数据集，比较微调和上下文学习的泛化能力，并提出结合上下文推理的微调方法。

Result: 上下文学习在某些情况下泛化更灵活，结合上下文推理的微调方法显著提高了泛化性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了不同学习模式的归纳偏差，并提出了一种实用的改进方法。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit exciting capabilities, yet can show
surprisingly narrow generalization from finetuning -- from failing to
generalize to simple reversals of relations they are trained on, to missing
logical deductions that can be made from trained information. These failures to
generalize from fine-tuning can hinder practical application of these models.
However, language models' in-context learning shows different inductive biases,
and can generalize better in some of these cases. Here, we explore these
differences in generalization between in-context- and fine-tuning-based
learning. To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and
improve models' ability to generalize from finetuning data. The datasets are
constructed to isolate the knowledge in the dataset from that in pretraining,
to create clean tests of generalization. We expose pretrained large models to
controlled subsets of the information in these datasets -- either in context,
or through fine-tuning -- and evaluate their performance on test sets that
require various types of generalization. We find overall that in data-matched
settings, in-context learning can generalize more flexibly than fine-tuning
(though we also find some qualifications of prior findings, such as cases when
fine-tuning can generalize to reversals embedded in a larger structure of
knowledge). We build on these findings to propose a method to enable improved
generalization from fine-tuning: adding in-context inferences to finetuning
data. We show that this method improves generalization across various splits of
our datasets and other benchmarks. Our results have implications for
understanding the inductive biases of different modes of learning in language
models, and practically improving their performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段框架，通过生成详细的分步批评和强化学习，提升LLM在数学问题中的批评能力，显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM快速发展，如何提供准确反馈和规模化监督成为关键问题，利用LLM作为批评模型实现自动化监督是一种有前景的解决方案。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1）用Qwen2.5-72B生成4.5K长格式批评数据用于监督微调；2）通过强化学习（基于PRM800K或自动标注数据）进一步提升批评能力。

Result: 基于Qwen2.5-7B的批评模型在错误识别基准上显著优于现有模型（如DeepSeek-R1-distill和GPT-4o），并能通过更详细反馈帮助生成模型修正错误。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了LLM的数学批评能力，为自动化监督提供了新思路。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving, providing accurate
feedback and scalable oversight on their outputs becomes an urgent and critical
problem. Leveraging LLMs as critique models to achieve automated supervision is
a promising solution. In this work, we focus on studying and enhancing the math
critique ability of LLMs. Current LLM critics provide critiques that are too
shallow and superficial on each step, leading to low judgment accuracy and
struggling to offer sufficient feedback for the LLM generator to correct
mistakes. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel and effective two-stage
framework to develop LLM critics that are capable of deliberately critiquing on
each reasoning step of math solutions. In the first stage, we utilize
Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to generate 4.5K long-form critiques as seed data for
supervised fine-tuning. Each seed critique consists of deliberate step-wise
critiques that includes multi-perspective verifications as well as in-depth
critiques of initial critiques for each reasoning step. Then, we perform
reinforcement learning on the fine-tuned model with either existing
human-labeled data from PRM800K or our automatically annotated data obtained
via Monte Carlo sampling-based correctness estimation, to further incentivize
its critique ability. Our developed critique model built on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct
not only significantly outperforms existing LLM critics (including the
same-sized DeepSeek-R1-distill models and GPT-4o) on various error
identification benchmarks, but also more effectively helps the LLM generator
refine erroneous steps through more detailed feedback.

Abstract: Memory is a fundamental component of AI systems, underpinning large language
models (LLMs) based agents. While prior surveys have focused on memory
applications with LLMs, they often overlook the atomic operations that underlie
memory dynamics. In this survey, we first categorize memory representations
into parametric, contextual structured, and contextual unstructured and then
introduce six fundamental memory operations: Consolidation, Updating, Indexing,
Forgetting, Retrieval, and Compression. We systematically map these operations
to the most relevant research topics across long-term, long-context, parametric
modification, and multi-source memory. By reframing memory systems through the
lens of atomic operations and representation types, this survey provides a
structured and dynamic perspective on research, benchmark datasets, and tools
related to memory in AI, clarifying the functional interplay in LLMs based
agents while outlining promising directions for future research\footnote{The

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在文本风格改写方面表现出色，但如何有效利用其能力进行示例式风格转换仍是一个挑战。关键在于如何描述示例的风格以指导模型生成高质量的改写文本。

Method: 提出一种基于语域分析的提示方法，指导大语言模型完成风格转换任务。

Conclusion: 基于语域分析的提示方法在风格转换任务中表现优于现有策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
rewriting text across various styles. However, effectively leveraging this
ability for example-based arbitrary style transfer, where an input text is
rewritten to match the style of a given exemplar, remains an open challenge. A
key question is how to describe the style of the exemplar to guide LLMs toward
high-quality rewrites. In this work, we propose a prompting method based on
register analysis to guide LLMs to perform this task. Empirical evaluations
across multiple style transfer tasks show that our prompting approach enhances
style transfer strength while preserving meaning more effectively than existing
prompting strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单次检测器中因空间分辨率与语义丰富度之间的权衡导致的小物体检测难题。

Method: 基于SSD框架，引入FMB、FRB和FFB模块，通过特征匹配、加权聚合和融合提升浅层特征描述能力。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了小物体检测的准确性，同时保持实时性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂视觉环境中的鲁棒物体检测提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Detecting small objects remains a significant challenge in single-shot object
detectors due to the inherent trade-off between spatial resolution and semantic
richness in convolutional feature maps. To address this issue, we propose a
novel framework that enables small object representations to "borrow"
discriminative features from larger, semantically richer instances within the
same class. Our architecture introduces three key components: the Feature
Matching Block (FMB) to identify semantically similar descriptors across
layers, the Feature Representing Block (FRB) to generate enhanced shallow
features through weighted aggregation, and the Feature Fusion Block (FFB) to
refine feature maps by integrating original, borrowed, and context information.
Built upon the SSD framework, our method improves the descriptive capacity of
shallow layers while maintaining real-time detection performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach significantly boosts small object
detection accuracy over baseline methods, offering a promising direction for
robust object detection in complex visual environments.

Method: 对三种VLM（Quilt-Net、Quilt-LLAVA和CONCH）进行消融研究，使用3,507张WSI数据集，通过结构化提示工程框架分析性能。

Result: CONCH模型在解剖学精确提示下表现最佳，解剖学上下文对性能至关重要，模型复杂性并非决定因素。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have gained significant attention in
computational pathology due to their multimodal learning capabilities that
enhance big-data analytics of giga-pixel whole slide image (WSI). However,
their sensitivity to large-scale clinical data, task formulations, and prompt
design remains an open question, particularly in terms of diagnostic accuracy.
In this paper, we present a systematic investigation and analysis of three
state of the art VLMs for histopathology, namely Quilt-Net, Quilt-LLAVA, and
CONCH, on an in-house digestive pathology dataset comprising 3,507 WSIs, each
in giga-pixel form, across distinct tissue types. Through a structured ablative
study on cancer invasiveness and dysplasia status, we develop a comprehensive
prompt engineering framework that systematically varies domain specificity,
anatomical precision, instructional framing, and output constraints. Our
findings demonstrate that prompt engineering significantly impacts model
performance, with the CONCH model achieving the highest accuracy when provided
with precise anatomical references. Additionally, we identify the critical
importance of anatomical context in histopathological image analysis, as
performance consistently degraded when reducing anatomical precision. We also
show that model complexity alone does not guarantee superior performance, as
effective domain alignment and domain-specific training are critical. These
results establish foundational guidelines for prompt engineering in
computational pathology and highlight the potential of VLMs to enhance
diagnostic accuracy when properly instructed with domain-appropriate prompts.

Abstract: The rising popularity of immersive visual experiences has increased interest
in stereoscopic 3D video generation. Despite significant advances in video
synthesis, creating 3D videos remains challenging due to the relative scarcity
of 3D video data. We propose a simple approach for transforming a text-to-video
generator into a video-to-stereo generator. Given an input video, our framework
automatically produces the video frames from a shifted viewpoint, enabling a
compelling 3D effect. Prior and concurrent approaches for this task typically
operate in multiple phases, first estimating video disparity or depth, then
warping the video accordingly to produce a second view, and finally inpainting
the disoccluded regions. This approach inherently fails when the scene involves
specular surfaces or transparent objects. In such cases, single-layer disparity
estimation is insufficient, resulting in artifacts and incorrect pixel shifts
during warping. Our work bypasses these restrictions by directly synthesizing
the new viewpoint, avoiding any intermediate steps. This is achieved by
leveraging a pre-trained video model's priors on geometry, object materials,
optics, and semantics, without relying on external geometry models or manually
disentangling geometry from the synthesis process. We demonstrate the
advantages of our approach in complex, real-world scenarios featuring diverse
object materials and compositions. See videos on

Abstract: The rapid evolution of social media has provided enhanced communication
channels for individuals to create online content, enabling them to express
their thoughts and opinions. Multimodal memes, often utilized for playful or
humorous expressions with visual and textual elements, are sometimes misused to
disseminate hate speech against individuals or groups. While the detection of
hateful memes is well-researched, developing effective methods to transform
hateful content in memes remains a significant challenge. Leveraging the
powerful generation and reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), we address the tasks of detecting and mitigating hateful content. This
paper presents two key contributions: first, a definition-guided prompting
technique for detecting hateful memes, and second, a unified framework for
mitigating hateful content in memes, named UnHateMeme, which works by replacing
hateful textual and/or visual components. With our definition-guided prompts,
VLMs achieve impressive performance on hateful memes detection task.
Furthermore, our UnHateMeme framework, integrated with VLMs, demonstrates a
strong capability to convert hateful memes into non-hateful forms that meet
human-level criteria for hate speech and maintain multimodal coherence between
image and text. Through empirical experiments, we show the effectiveness of
state-of-the-art pretrained VLMs such as LLaVA, Gemini and GPT-4o on the
proposed tasks, providing a comprehensive analysis of their respective
strengths and limitations for these tasks. This paper aims to shed light on
important applications of VLMs for ensuring safe and respectful online
environments.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong capabilities in
understanding and analyzing visual scenes across various domains. However, in
the context of autonomous driving, their limited comprehension of 3D

performance without requiring fine-tuning. Through a dedicated preprocessing
pipeline that extracts 3D object data, our method improves situational
awareness and decision-making in complex traffic scenarios, achieving a score
of 0.56 on the LingoQA benchmark. We further explore different fusion
strategies and token combinations with the goal of advancing the interpretation
of traffic scenes, ultimately enabling safer autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: A current limitation of video generative video models is that they generate
plausible looking frames, but poor motion -- an issue that is not well captured
by FVD and other popular methods for evaluating generated videos. Here we go
beyond FVD by developing a metric which better measures plausible object
interactions and motion. Our novel approach is based on auto-encoding point
tracks and yields motion features that can be used to not only compare
distributions of videos (as few as one generated and one ground truth, or as
many as two datasets), but also for evaluating motion of single videos. We show
that using point tracks instead of pixel reconstruction or action recognition
features results in a metric which is markedly more sensitive to temporal
distortions in synthetic data, and can predict human evaluations of temporal
consistency and realism in generated videos obtained from open-source models
better than a wide range of alternatives. We also show that by using a point
track representation, we can spatiotemporally localize generative video
inconsistencies, providing extra interpretability of generated video errors
relative to prior work. An overview of the results and link to the code can be

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) enables applications in holographic
augmented reality (AR), 3D displays, systems neuroscience, and optical
trapping. The fundamental challenge in CGH is solving the inverse problem of
phase retrieval from intensity measurements. Physics-inspired neural networks
(PINNs), especially Gerchberg-Saxton-based PINNs (GS-PINNs), have advanced
phase retrieval capabilities. However, their performance strongly depends on
forward models (FMs) and their hyperparameters (FMHs), limiting generalization,
complicating benchmarking, and hindering hardware optimization. We present a
systematic sensitivity analysis framework based on Saltelli's extension of
Sobol's method to quantify FMH impacts on GS-PINN performance. Our analysis
demonstrates that SLM pixel-resolution is the primary factor affecting neural
network sensitivity, followed by pixel-pitch, propagation distance, and
wavelength. Free space propagation forward models demonstrate superior neural
network performance compared to Fourier holography, providing enhanced
parameterization and generalization. We introduce a composite evaluation metric
combining performance consistency, generalization capability, and
hyperparameter perturbation resilience, establishing a unified benchmarking
standard across CGH configurations. Our research connects physics-inspired deep
learning theory with practical CGH implementations through concrete guidelines
for forward model selection, neural network architecture, and performance
evaluation. Our contributions advance the development of robust, interpretable,
and generalizable neural networks for diverse holographic applications,
supporting evidence-based decisions in CGH research and implementation.

Conclusion: AVA在开放场景和超长视频分析中表现出色，为视频理解提供了新方向。

Abstract: AI-driven video analytics has become increasingly pivotal across diverse
domains. However, existing systems are often constrained to specific,
predefined tasks, limiting their adaptability in open-ended analytical
scenarios. The recent emergence of Video-Language Models (VLMs) as
transformative technologies offers significant potential for enabling
open-ended video understanding, reasoning, and analytics. Nevertheless, their
limited context windows present challenges when processing ultra-long video
content, which is prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we
introduce AVA, a VLM-powered system designed for open-ended, advanced video
analytics. AVA incorporates two key innovations: (1) the near real-time
construction of Event Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) for efficient indexing of long or
continuous video streams, and (2) an agentic retrieval-generation mechanism
that leverages EKGs to handle complex and diverse queries. Comprehensive
evaluations on public benchmarks, LVBench and VideoMME-Long, demonstrate that
AVA achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 62.3% and 64.1% accuracy,
respectively, significantly surpassing existing VLM and video
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Furthermore, to evaluate video
analytics in ultra-long and open-world video scenarios, we introduce a new
benchmark, AVA-100. This benchmark comprises 8 videos, each exceeding 10 hours
in duration, along with 120 manually annotated, diverse, and complex
question-answer pairs. On AVA-100, AVA achieves top-tier performance with an

Conclusion: Pack-PTQ通过保留跨块依赖性和混合精度量化，显著提升了低比特量化性能。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has evolved as a prominent solution for
compressing complex models, which advocates a small calibration dataset and
avoids end-to-end retraining. However, most existing PTQ methods employ
block-wise reconstruction, which neglects cross-block dependency and exhibits a
notable accuracy drop in low-bit cases. To address these limitations, this
paper presents a novel PTQ method, dubbed Pack-PTQ. First, we design a
Hessian-guided adaptive packing mechanism to partition blocks into
non-overlapping packs, which serve as the base unit for reconstruction, thereby
preserving the cross-block dependency and enabling accurate quantization
parameters estimation. Second, based on the pack configuration, we propose a
mixed-precision quantization approach to assign varied bit-widths to packs
according to their distinct sensitivities, thereby further enhancing
performance. Extensive experiments on 2D image and 3D point cloud
classification tasks, using various network architectures, demonstrate the
superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art PTQ methods.

TL;DR: AdCare-VLM是一种基于视频的多模态大视觉语言模型，用于通过患者视频进行药物依从性视觉问答（VQA），在结核病药物监测视频上表现优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性疾病患者药物依从性差，需通过技术手段提升监测效果。

Method: 使用806个结核病药物监测视频数据集，结合视觉特征与医学概念，训练视频-语言模型。

Result: 模型性能优于LLaVA-V1.5和Chat-UniVi，提升3.1%至3.54%。

Conclusion: AdCare-VLM通过多模态交互提升药物依从性监测效果，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Chronic diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, asthma, HIV-AIDS,
epilepsy, and tuberculosis, necessitate rigorous adherence to medication to
avert disease progression, manage symptoms, and decrease mortality rates.
Adherence is frequently undermined by factors including patient behavior,
caregiver support, elevated medical costs, and insufficient healthcare
infrastructure. We propose AdCare-VLM, a specialized Video-LLaVA-based
multimodal large vision language model (LVLM) aimed at visual question
answering (VQA) concerning medication adherence through patient videos. We
employ a private dataset comprising 806 custom-annotated tuberculosis (TB)
medication monitoring videos, which have been labeled by clinical experts, to
fine-tune the model for adherence pattern detection. We present LLM-TB-VQA, a
detailed medical adherence VQA dataset that encompasses positive, negative, and
ambiguous adherence cases. Our method identifies correlations between visual
features, such as the clear visibility of the patient's face, medication, water
intake, and the act of ingestion, and their associated medical concepts in
captions. This facilitates the integration of aligned visual-linguistic
representations and improves multimodal interactions. Experimental results
indicate that our method surpasses parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
enabled VLM models, such as LLaVA-V1.5 and Chat-UniVi, with absolute
improvements ranging from 3.1% to 3.54% across pre-trained, regular, and
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) configurations. Comprehensive ablation studies and
attention map visualizations substantiate our approach, enhancing
interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于气体泄漏分割的FGSTP算法，通过捕捉帧间运动信息并结合精细化的对象特征，实现了高效准确的分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气体泄漏隐蔽且形状随机，现有方法难以高效准确地检测和分割。

Method: 构建相关性体积捕捉帧间运动信息，逐步精细化对象特征，使用解码器优化边界分割。

Result: 在GasVid数据集上表现优异，分割精度优于其他SOTA模型。

Conclusion: FGSTP算法在气体泄漏分割任务中表现出色，为隐蔽目标分割提供了新思路。

Abstract: Gas leaks pose significant risks to human health and the environment. Despite
long-standing concerns, there are limited methods that can efficiently and
accurately detect and segment leaks due to their concealed appearance and
random shapes. In this paper, we propose a Fine-grained Spatial-Temporal
Perception (FGSTP) algorithm for gas leak segmentation. FGSTP captures critical
motion clues across frames and integrates them with refined object features in
an end-to-end network. Specifically, we first construct a correlation volume to
capture motion information between consecutive frames. Then, the fine-grained
perception progressively refines the object-level features using previous
outputs. Finally, a decoder is employed to optimize boundary segmentation.
Because there is no highly precise labeled dataset for gas leak segmentation,
we manually label a gas leak video dataset, GasVid. Experimental results on
GasVid demonstrate that our model excels in segmenting non-rigid objects such
as gas leaks, generating the most accurate mask compared to other
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线自适应放疗中，自动轮廓的质量评估需要高效且可靠的方法，以减少手动工作量和提高临床决策速度。

Method: 开发了贝叶斯序数分类模型，通过校准不确定性阈值优化预测准确性，并在三种数据场景下验证（无标注、有限标注、充足标注）。

Result: 模型在所有场景下表现稳健，仅需少量手动标注即可达到90%以上的准确率，显著减少不必要的审查。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了放疗轮廓效率，通过不确定性量化确保更安全、可靠的工作流程。

Abstract: Purpose: This study presents a Deep Learning (DL)-based quality assessment
(QA) approach for evaluating auto-generated contours (auto-contours) in
radiotherapy, with emphasis on Online Adaptive Radiotherapy (OART). Leveraging
Bayesian Ordinal Classification (BOC) and calibrated uncertainty thresholds,
the method enables confident QA predictions without relying on ground truth
contours or extensive manual labeling. Methods: We developed a BOC model to
classify auto-contour quality and quantify prediction uncertainty. A
calibration step was used to optimize uncertainty thresholds that meet clinical
accuracy needs. The method was validated under three data scenarios: no manual
labels, limited labels, and extensive labels. For rectum contours in prostate
cancer, we applied geometric surrogate labels when manual labels were absent,
transfer learning when limited, and direct supervision when ample labels were
available. Results: The BOC model delivered robust performance across all
scenarios. Fine-tuning with just 30 manual labels and calibrating with 34
subjects yielded over 90% accuracy on test data. Using the calibrated
threshold, over 93% of the auto-contours' qualities were accurately predicted
in over 98% of cases, reducing unnecessary manual reviews and highlighting
cases needing correction. Conclusion: The proposed QA model enhances contouring
efficiency in OART by reducing manual workload and enabling fast, informed
clinical decisions. Through uncertainty quantification, it ensures safer, more
reliable radiotherapy workflows.

Motivation: 由于合成媒体的兴起对数字身份和网络安全构成威胁，深度伪造检测变得至关重要。现有方法在多样数据集和操纵类型上表现不一致，需改进。

Method: 采用Xception、Res2Net101和EfficientNet-B7三种架构，每种初始化三次以增强多样性，并通过两层动态权重机制结合预测结果。

Result: 在FF++和CelebDF-v2数据集上取得了AUC和F1分数的最高性能，同时在跨数据集评估中表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过动态权重和模型多样性显著提升了深度伪造检测的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Deepfake detection has become increasingly important due to the rise of
synthetic media, which poses significant risks to digital identity and cyber
presence for security and trust. While multiple approaches have improved
detection accuracy, challenges remain in achieving consistent performance
across diverse datasets and manipulation types. In response, we propose a novel
two-tier ensemble framework for deepfake detection based on deep learning that
hierarchically combines multiple instances of three state-of-the-art
architectures: Xception, Res2Net101, and EfficientNet-B7. Our framework employs
a unique approach where each architecture is instantiated three times with
different initializations to enhance model diversity, followed by a learnable
weighting mechanism that dynamically combines their predictions. Unlike
traditional fixed-weight ensembles, our first-tier averages predictions within
each architecture family to reduce model variance, while the second tier learns
optimal contribution weights through backpropagation, automatically adjusting
each architecture's influence based on their detection reliability. Our
experiments achieved state-of-the-art intra-dataset performance with AUC scores
of 99.22% (FF++) and 100.00% (CelebDF-v2), and F1 scores of 98.06% (FF++) and
99.94% (CelebDF-v2) without augmentation. With augmentation, we achieve AUC
scores of 99.47% (FF++) and 100.00% (CelebDF-v2), and F1 scores of 98.43%
(FF++) and 99.95% (CelebDF-v2). The framework demonstrates robust cross-dataset
generalization, achieving AUC scores of 88.20% and 72.52%, and F1 scores of
93.16% and 80.62% in cross-dataset evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度学习在超分辨率领域取得进展，但在高倍放大时保持细节和纹理的真实性仍具挑战性。扩散模型虽有潜力，但难以平衡感知质量与结构保真度。

Method: 提出ResQu框架，集成四元数小波预处理和潜在扩散模型，引入时间感知编码器，动态集成小波嵌入于去噪过程。

Result: 在领域特定数据集上表现优异，超越现有方法，提升感知质量和标准评估指标。

Conclusion: ResQu通过创新结合小波和扩散模型，显著提升超分辨率效果，代码将在修订后公开。

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution is a fundamental problem in computer vision with broad
applications spacing from medical imaging to satellite analysis. The ability to
reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs is crucial for
enhancing downstream tasks such as object detection and segmentation. While
deep learning has significantly advanced SR, achieving high-quality
reconstructions with fine-grained details and realistic textures remains
challenging, particularly at high upscaling factors. Recent approaches
leveraging diffusion models have demonstrated promising results, yet they often
struggle to balance perceptual quality with structural fidelity. In this work,
we introduce ResQu a novel SR framework that integrates a quaternion wavelet
preprocessing framework with latent diffusion models, incorporating a new
quaternion wavelet- and time-aware encoder. Unlike prior methods that simply
apply wavelet transforms within diffusion models, our approach enhances the
conditioning process by exploiting quaternion wavelet embeddings, which are
dynamically integrated at different stages of denoising. Furthermore, we also
leverage the generative priors of foundation models such as Stable Diffusion.
Extensive experiments on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that our method
achieves outstanding SR results, outperforming in many cases existing
approaches in perceptual quality and standard evaluation metrics. The code will
be available after the revision process.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NVTM提出了一种新的视频表示框架，通过将时空3D视频数据分解为带有流信息的2D网格，实现了快速学习和参数高效性，显著提升了编码速度和视频质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于网格的隐式神经表示（INR）方法在视频应用中存在参数冗余和比特率较高的问题，需要一种更高效的动态视频表示方法。

Method: NVTM将时空3D视频数据分解为带有流信息的2D网格，通过时间相干调制捕捉视频动态特性，实现快速学习和参数高效性。

Result: NVTM在编码速度上比NeRV快3倍以上，PSNR/LPIPS指标显著提升，且在压缩任务中表现与H.264/HEVC相当。

Conclusion: NVTM是一种高效的视频表示框架，适用于多种任务，如超分辨率、帧插值和视频修复。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INR) has found successful applications
across diverse domains. To employ INR in real-life, it is important to speed up
training. In the field of INR for video applications, the state-of-the-art
approach employs grid-type parametric encoding and successfully achieves a
faster encoding speed in comparison to its predecessors. However, the grid
usage, which does not consider the video's dynamic nature, leads to redundant
use of trainable parameters. As a result, it has significantly lower parameter
efficiency and higher bitrate compared to NeRV-style methods that do not use a
parametric encoding. To address the problem, we propose Neural Video
representation with Temporally coherent Modulation (NVTM), a novel framework
that can capture dynamic characteristics of video. By decomposing the
spatio-temporal 3D video data into a set of 2D grids with flow information,
NVTM enables learning video representation rapidly and uses parameter
efficiently. Our framework enables to process temporally corresponding pixels
at once, resulting in the fastest encoding speed for a reasonable video
quality, especially when compared to the NeRV-style method, with a speed
increase of over 3 times. Also, it remarks an average of 1.54dB/0.019
improvements in PSNR/LPIPS on UVG (Dynamic) (even with 10% fewer parameters)
and an average of 1.84dB/0.013 improvements in PSNR/LPIPS on MCL-JCV (Dynamic),
compared to previous grid-type works. By expanding this to compression tasks,
we demonstrate comparable performance to video compression standards (H.264,
HEVC) and recent INR approaches for video compression. Additionally, we perform
extensive experiments demonstrating the superior performance of our algorithm
across diverse tasks, encompassing super resolution, frame interpolation and
video inpainting. Project page is https://sujiikim.github.io/NVTM/.

<details>

Motivation: 神经母细胞瘤手术规划依赖耗时且依赖用户的MRI 3D模型，需开发自动分割方法。

Method: 组织SPPIN挑战赛，提供多模态MRI数据集，评估团队基于Dice分数、HD95和VS的分割性能。

Result: 最佳团队Dice分数0.82，HD95 7.69 mm，VS 0.91，但小肿瘤分割效果较差。

Conclusion: 预训练网络在小数据集有效，但需更可靠方法以支持临床手术规划。

Abstract: Surgery plays an important role within the treatment for neuroblastoma, a
common pediatric cancer. This requires careful planning, often via magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI)-based anatomical 3D models. However, creating these
models is often time-consuming and user dependent. We organized the Surgical
Planning in Pediatric Neuroblastoma (SPPIN) challenge, to stimulate
developments on this topic, and set a benchmark for fully automatic
segmentation of neuroblastoma on multi-model MRI. The challenge started with a
training phase, where teams received 78 sets of MRI scans from 34 patients,
consisting of both diagnostic and post-chemotherapy MRI scans. The final test
phase, consisting of 18 MRI sets from 9 patients, determined the ranking of the
teams. Ranking was based on the Dice similarity coefficient (Dice score), the
95th percentile of the Hausdorff distance (HD95) and the volumetric similarity
(VS). The SPPIN challenge was hosted at MICCAI 2023. The final leaderboard
consisted of 9 teams. The highest-ranking team achieved a median Dice score
0.82, a median HD95 of 7.69 mm and a VS of 0.91, utilizing a large, pretrained
network called STU-Net. A significant difference for the segmentation results
between diagnostic and post-chemotherapy MRI scans was observed (Dice = 0.89 vs
Dice = 0.59, P = 0.01) for the highest-ranking team. SPPIN is the first medical
segmentation challenge in extracranial pediatric oncology. The highest-ranking
team used a large pre-trained network, suggesting that pretraining can be of
use in small, heterogenous datasets. Although the results of the
highest-ranking team were high for most patients, segmentation especially in
small, pre-treated tumors were insufficient. Therefore, more reliable
segmentation methods are needed to create clinically applicable models to aid
surgical planning in pediatric neuroblastoma.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖高保真3D点云或跨视图关联预处理，但NeRF的隐式3D场能自然实现全局一致性，避免这些限制。

Method: 提出三阶段训练框架（初始化-消歧-细化），利用NeRF的隐式几何和实例消歧方法确保全局唯一3D实例ID。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Cues3D优于基于2D图像的方法，并与最新的2D-3D融合方法竞争，甚至在使用额外3D点云时超越它们。

Conclusion: Cues3D通过NeRF的隐式几何实现了高效且一致的3D实例分割，为开放词汇3D全景分割提供了新思路。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D panoptic segmentation has recently emerged as a
significant trend. Top-performing methods currently integrate 2D segmentation
with geometry-aware 3D primitives. However, the advantage would be lost without
high-fidelity 3D point clouds, such as methods based on Neural Radiance Field
(NeRF). These methods are limited by the insufficient capacity to maintain
consistency across partial observations. To address this, recent works have
utilized contrastive loss or cross-view association pre-processing for view
consensus. In contrast to them, we present Cues3D, a compact approach that
relies solely on NeRF instead of pre-associations. The core idea is that NeRF's
implicit 3D field inherently establishes a globally consistent geometry,
enabling effective object distinction without explicit cross-view supervision.
We propose a three-phase training framework for NeRF,
initialization-disambiguation-refinement, whereby the instance IDs are
corrected using the initially-learned knowledge. Additionally, an instance
disambiguation method is proposed to match NeRF-rendered 3D masks and ensure
globally unique 3D instance identities. With the aid of Cues3D, we obtain
highly consistent and unique 3D instance ID for each object across views with a
balanced version of NeRF. Our experiments are conducted on ScanNet v2,
ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and Replica datasets for 3D instance, panoptic, and
semantic segmentation tasks. Cues3D outperforms other 2D image-based methods
and competes with the latest 2D-3D merging based methods, while even surpassing
them when using additional 3D point clouds. The code link could be found in the
appendix and will be released on

Method: 通过全面评估NIR-VIS跨光谱人脸识别系统对呈现攻击的脆弱性。

Result: 研究发现系统虽有一定可靠性，但仍易受特定攻击。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究以提高跨光谱人脸识别系统的安全性。

Abstract: Cross-spectral face recognition systems are designed to enhance the
performance of facial recognition systems by enabling cross-modal matching
under challenging operational conditions. A particularly relevant application
is the matching of near-infrared (NIR) images to visible-spectrum (VIS) images,
enabling the verification of individuals by comparing NIR facial captures
acquired with VIS reference images. The use of NIR imaging offers several
advantages, including greater robustness to illumination variations, better
visibility through glasses and glare, and greater resistance to presentation
attacks. Despite these claimed benefits, the robustness of NIR-based systems
against presentation attacks has not been systematically studied in the
literature. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation into the
vulnerability of NIR-VIS cross-spectral face recognition systems to
presentation attacks. Our empirical findings indicate that, although these
systems exhibit a certain degree of reliability, they remain vulnerable to
specific attacks, emphasizing the need for further research in this area.

Motivation: 现有显著性检测方法在运动模糊和遮挡场景中表现不佳，脉冲相机的高时间分辨率虽能提升显著性图，但其固有噪声会导致检测不连续和偏差。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上验证，SOTA优于现有方法，有效消除复合噪声偏差。

Conclusion: SOTA框架显著提升了显著性检测的准确性和鲁棒性，代码和数据集将开源。

Abstract: Existing saliency detection methods struggle in real-world scenarios due to
motion blur and occlusions. In contrast, spike cameras, with their high
temporal resolution, significantly enhance visual saliency maps. However, the
composite noise inherent to spike camera imaging introduces discontinuities in
saliency detection. Low-quality samples further distort model predictions,
leading to saliency bias. To address these challenges, we propose
Spike-navigated Optimal TrAnsport Saliency Region Detection (SOTA), a framework
that leverages the strengths of spike cameras while mitigating biases in both
spatial and temporal dimensions. Our method introduces Spike-based Micro-debias
(SM) to capture subtle frame-to-frame variations and preserve critical details,
even under minimal scene or lighting changes. Additionally, Spike-based
Global-debias (SG) refines predictions by reducing inconsistencies across
diverse conditions. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets
demonstrate that SOTA outperforms existing methods by eliminating composite
noise bias. Our code and dataset will be released at

Abstract: High-quality, animatable 3D human avatar reconstruction from monocular videos
offers significant potential for reducing reliance on complex hardware, making
it highly practical for applications in game development, augmented reality,
and social media. However, existing methods still face substantial challenges
in capturing fine geometric details and maintaining animation stability,
particularly under dynamic or complex poses. To address these issues, we
propose a novel real-time framework for animatable human avatar reconstruction
based on 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS). By leveraging 2DGS and global SMPL pose
parameters, our framework not only aligns positional and rotational
discrepancies but also enables robust and natural pose-driven animation of the
reconstructed avatars. Furthermore, we introduce a Rotation Compensation
Network (RCN) that learns rotation residuals by integrating local geometric
features with global pose parameters. This network significantly improves the
handling of non-rigid deformations and ensures smooth, artifact-free pose
transitions during animation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
successfully reconstructs realistic and highly animatable human avatars from
monocular videos, effectively preserving fine-grained details while ensuring
stable and natural pose variation. Our approach surpasses current
state-of-the-art methods in both reconstruction quality and animation
robustness on public benchmarks.

Abstract: 3D part assembly aims to understand part relationships and predict their
6-DoF poses to construct realistic 3D shapes, addressing the growing demand for
autonomous assembly, which is crucial for robots. Existing methods mainly
estimate the transformation of each part by training neural networks under
supervision, which requires a substantial quantity of manually labeled data.
However, the high cost of data collection and the immense variability of
real-world shapes and parts make traditional methods impractical for
large-scale applications. In this paper, we propose first a zero-shot part
assembly method that utilizes pre-trained point cloud diffusion models as
discriminators in the assembly process, guiding the manipulation of parts to
form realistic shapes. Specifically, we theoretically demonstrate that
utilizing a diffusion model for zero-shot part assembly can be transformed into
an Iterative Closest Point (ICP) process. Then, we propose a novel pushing-away
strategy to address the overlap parts, thereby further enhancing the robustness
of the method. To verify our work, we conduct extensive experiments and
quantitative comparisons to several strong baseline methods, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the proposed approach, which even surpasses the supervised
learning method. The code has been released on

Result: JointDiT在联合生成任务中表现优异，同时在深度估计和深度条件生成中达到可比结果。

Conclusion: JointDiT表明联合分布建模可以替代条件生成，为多模态生成任务提供新思路。

Abstract: We present JointDiT, a diffusion transformer that models the joint
distribution of RGB and depth. By leveraging the architectural benefit and
outstanding image prior of the state-of-the-art diffusion transformer, JointDiT
not only generates high-fidelity images but also produces geometrically
plausible and accurate depth maps. This solid joint distribution modeling is
achieved through two simple yet effective techniques that we propose, i.e.,
adaptive scheduling weights, which depend on the noise levels of each modality,
and the unbalanced timestep sampling strategy. With these techniques, we train
our model across all noise levels for each modality, enabling JointDiT to
naturally handle various combinatorial generation tasks, including joint
generation, depth estimation, and depth-conditioned image generation by simply
controlling the timestep of each branch. JointDiT demonstrates outstanding
joint generation performance. Furthermore, it achieves comparable results in
depth estimation and depth-conditioned image generation, suggesting that joint
distribution modeling can serve as a replaceable alternative to conditional
generation. The project page is available at

TL;DR: KeySync是一个两阶段框架，解决了唇同步中的时间一致性、表情泄漏和面部遮挡问题，取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 唇同步任务在现实应用中面临表情泄漏和面部遮挡等挑战，现有研究常忽视这些问题。

Method: 采用两阶段框架和精心设计的掩码策略，解决时间一致性、泄漏和遮挡问题。

Result: KeySync在唇重建和跨同步方面取得最佳效果，视觉质量提升，泄漏减少。

Conclusion: KeySync通过新掩码方法和架构选择，有效解决了唇同步中的关键问题。

Abstract: Lip synchronization, known as the task of aligning lip movements in an
existing video with new input audio, is typically framed as a simpler variant
of audio-driven facial animation. However, as well as suffering from the usual
issues in talking head generation (e.g., temporal consistency), lip
synchronization presents significant new challenges such as expression leakage
from the input video and facial occlusions, which can severely impact
real-world applications like automated dubbing, but are often neglected in
existing works. To address these shortcomings, we present KeySync, a two-stage
framework that succeeds in solving the issue of temporal consistency, while
also incorporating solutions for leakage and occlusions using a carefully
designed masking strategy. We show that KeySync achieves state-of-the-art
results in lip reconstruction and cross-synchronization, improving visual
quality and reducing expression leakage according to LipLeak, our novel leakage
metric. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our new masking
approach in handling occlusions and validate our architectural choices through
several ablation studies. Code and model weights can be found at

Conclusion: HATIE为文本引导图像编辑任务提供了可靠且人类对齐的评估标准，填补了当前研究的空白。

Abstract: A variety of text-guided image editing models have been proposed recently.
However, there is no widely-accepted standard evaluation method mainly due to
the subjective nature of the task, letting researchers rely on manual user
study. To address this, we introduce a novel Human-Aligned benchmark for
Text-guided Image Editing (HATIE). Providing a large-scale benchmark set
covering a wide range of editing tasks, it allows reliable evaluation, not
limited to specific easy-to-evaluate cases. Also, HATIE provides a
fully-automated and omnidirectional evaluation pipeline. Particularly, we
combine multiple scores measuring various aspects of editing so as to align
with human perception. We empirically verify that the evaluation of HATIE is
indeed human-aligned in various aspects, and provide benchmark results on
several state-of-the-art models to provide deeper insights on their
performance.

Motivation: 主动学习在自动驾驶样本选择中具有潜力，但现有方法忽略实际应用中的启发式特征，导致样本选择效果不佳。

Method: HeAL整合启发式特征（如物体距离和点数量）与定位和分类，优化样本选择。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，HeAL的mAP与全监督基线相当，仅需24%样本。

Conclusion: HeAL通过结合启发式特征，显著提升了主动学习在3D目标检测中的实用性。

Abstract: Active Learning has proved to be a relevant approach to perform sample
selection for training models for Autonomous Driving. Particularly, previous
works on active learning for 3D object detection have shown that selection of
samples in uncontrolled scenarios is challenging. Furthermore, current
approaches focus exclusively on the theoretical aspects of the sample selection
problem but neglect the practical insights that can be obtained from the
extensive literature and application of 3D detection models. In this paper, we
introduce HeAL (Heuristical-enhanced Active Learning for 3D Object Detection)
which integrates those heuristical features together with Localization and
Classification to deliver the most contributing samples to the model's
training. In contrast to previous works, our approach integrates heuristical
features such as object distance and point-quantity to estimate the
uncertainty, which enhance the usefulness of selected samples to train
detection models. Our quantitative evaluation on KITTI shows that HeAL presents
competitive mAP with respect to the State-of-the-Art, and achieves the same mAP
as the full-supervised baseline with only 24% of the samples.

Motivation: 当前自动驾驶目标检测模型依赖大量标注数据，成本高昂，需优化数据获取与标注过程。

Method: 扩展主动学习至LiDAR领域，开发基于不一致性的样本选择策略，并在多种设置下评估其效果。

Result: 基于检测框数量的简单不一致性方法，仅需50%标注数据即可达到与随机采样相同的mAP。

Conclusion: 主动学习策略在LiDAR领域具有潜力，可显著减少数据标注需求。

Abstract: Deep learning models for object detection in autonomous driving have recently
achieved impressive performance gains and are already being deployed in
vehicles worldwide. However, current models require increasingly large datasets
for training. Acquiring and labeling such data is costly, necessitating the
development of new strategies to optimize this process. Active learning is a
promising approach that has been extensively researched in the image domain. In
our work, we extend this concept to the LiDAR domain by developing several
inconsistency-based sample selection strategies and evaluate their
effectiveness in various settings. Our results show that using a naive
inconsistency approach based on the number of detected boxes, we achieve the
same mAP as the random sampling strategy with 50% of the labeled data.

Motivation: 交叉口是道路网络的关键点，但现有检测器忽略车载语义信息或依赖稀缺人工标注数据。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI数据集上，平均定位误差1.9米，精度89%，召回率77%（5米容忍度），优于基线。

Conclusion: 该方法对分割错误具有鲁棒性，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Intersections are geometric and functional key points in every road network.
They offer strong landmarks to correct GNSS dropouts and anchor new sensor data
in up-to-date maps. Despite that importance, intersection detectors either
ignore the rich semantic information already computed onboard or depend on
scarce, hand-labeled intersection datasets. To close that gap, this paper
presents a LiDAR-based method for intersection detection that (i) fuses
semantic road segmentation with vehicle localization to detect intersection
candidates in a bird's eye view (BEV) representation and (ii) refines those
candidates by analyzing branch topology with a least squares formulation. To
evaluate our method, we introduce an automated benchmarking pipeline that pairs
detections with OpenStreetMap (OSM) intersection nodes using precise GNSS/INS
ground-truth poses. Tested on eight SemanticKITTI sequences, the approach
achieves a mean localization error of 1.9 m, 89% precision, and 77% recall at a
5 m tolerance, outperforming the latest learning-based baseline. Moreover, the
method is robust to segmentation errors higher than those of the benchmark
model, demonstrating its applicability in the real world.

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂交通场景中表现出色，能够实现鲁棒且准确的车辆跟踪。

Abstract: Vision sensors are becoming more important in Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) for traffic monitoring, management, and optimization as the
number of network cameras continues to rise. However, manual object tracking
and matching across multiple non-overlapping cameras pose significant
challenges in city-scale urban traffic scenarios. These challenges include
handling diverse vehicle attributes, occlusions, illumination variations,
shadows, and varying video resolutions. To address these issues, we propose an
efficient and cost-effective deep learning-based framework for Multi-Object
Multi-Camera Tracking (MO-MCT). The proposed framework utilizes Mask R-CNN for
object detection and employs Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to select target
objects from overlapping detections. Transfer learning is employed for
re-identification, enabling the association and generation of vehicle tracklets
across multiple cameras. Moreover, we leverage appropriate loss functions and
distance measures to handle occlusion, illumination, and shadow challenges. The
final solution identification module performs feature extraction using
ResNet-152 coupled with Deep SORT based vehicle tracking. The proposed
framework is evaluated on the 5th AI City Challenge dataset (Track 3),
comprising 46 camera feeds. Among these 46 camera streams, 40 are used for
model training and validation, while the remaining six are utilized for model
testing. The proposed framework achieves competitive performance with an IDF1
score of 0.8289, and precision and recall scores of 0.9026 and 0.8527
respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness in robust and accurate vehicle
tracking.

Motivation: 在X射线安全成像领域，CNN方法占主导地位，但CNN与Transformer的结合尚未充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 评估了多种混合CNN-Transformer架构（如HGNetV2和Next-ViT-S），并与YOLOv8基线进行比较，测试了三个公开数据集（EDS、HiXray、PIDray）。

Conclusion: 混合CNN-Transformer架构在特定场景下表现更优，为未来研究提供了方向，代码和模型权重已开源。

Abstract: In the field of X-ray security applications, even the smallest details can
significantly impact outcomes. Objects that are heavily occluded or
intentionally concealed pose a great challenge for detection, whether by human
observation or through advanced technological applications. While certain Deep
Learning (DL) architectures demonstrate strong performance in processing local
information, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), others excel in
handling distant information, e.g., transformers. In X-ray security imaging the
literature has been dominated by the use of CNN-based methods, while the
integration of the two aforementioned leading architectures has not been
sufficiently explored. In this paper, various hybrid CNN-transformer
architectures are evaluated against a common CNN object detection baseline,
namely YOLOv8. In particular, a CNN (HGNetV2) and a hybrid CNN-transformer
(Next-ViT-S) backbone are combined with different CNN/transformer detection
heads (YOLOv8 and RT-DETR). The resulting architectures are comparatively
evaluated on three challenging public X-ray inspection datasets, namely EDS,
HiXray, and PIDray. Interestingly, while the YOLOv8 detector with its default
backbone (CSP-DarkNet53) is generally shown to be advantageous on the HiXray
and PIDray datasets, when a domain distribution shift is incorporated in the
X-ray images (as happens in the EDS datasets), hybrid CNN-transformer
architectures exhibit increased robustness. Detailed comparative evaluation
results, including object-level detection performance and object-size error
analysis, demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of each architectural
combination and suggest guidelines for future research. The source code and
network weights of the models employed in this study are available at

TL;DR: BM-MAE是一种针对多模态MRI数据的预训练策略，能够适应任意模态组合，无需为每种组合单独训练模型，显著提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态MRI数据在脑肿瘤诊疗中至关重要，但实际应用中常因各种原因缺失某些模态，现有方法需为每种组合单独训练模型，资源消耗大且不实用。

Method: 提出BM-MAE，一种基于掩码图像建模的预训练策略，同一预训练模型可适应任意模态组合，捕获模态内和模态间信息。

Result: 实验表明BM-MAE优于或与基线方法相当，且显著优于从头训练，还能高效重建缺失模态。

Conclusion: BM-MAE为多模态MRI数据提供了一种高效、灵活的预训练解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) constitutes the first line of
investigation for clinicians in the care of brain tumors, providing crucial
insights for surgery planning, treatment monitoring, and biomarker
identification. Pre-training on large datasets have been shown to help models
learn transferable representations and adapt with minimal labeled data. This
behavior is especially valuable in medical imaging, where annotations are often
scarce. However, applying this paradigm to multimodal medical data introduces a
challenge: most existing approaches assume that all imaging modalities are
available during both pre-training and fine-tuning. In practice, missing
modalities often occur due to acquisition issues, specialist unavailability, or
specific experimental designs on small in-house datasets. Consequently, a
common approach involves training a separate model for each desired modality
combination, making the process both resource-intensive and impractical for
clinical use. Therefore, we introduce BM-MAE, a masked image modeling
pre-training strategy tailored for multimodal MRI data. The same pre-trained
model seamlessly adapts to any combination of available modalities, extracting
rich representations that capture both intra- and inter-modal information. This
allows fine-tuning on any subset of modalities without requiring architectural
changes, while still benefiting from a model pre-trained on the full set of
modalities. Extensive experiments show that the proposed pre-training strategy
outperforms or remains competitive with baselines that require separate
pre-training for each modality subset, while substantially surpassing training
from scratch on several downstream tasks. Additionally, it can quickly and
efficiently reconstruct missing modalities, highlighting its practical value.

Result: AnimalMotionCLIP在Animal Kingdom数据集上优于现有方法，能准确识别精细时序动作。

Conclusion: AnimalMotionCLIP有效解决了动物行为识别中的关键问题，展示了其在复杂任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of interest in applying deep learning
techniques to animal behavior recognition, particularly leveraging pre-trained
visual language models, such as CLIP, due to their remarkable generalization
capacity across various downstream tasks. However, adapting these models to the
specific domain of animal behavior recognition presents two significant
challenges: integrating motion information and devising an effective temporal
modeling scheme. In this paper, we propose AnimalMotionCLIP to address these
challenges by interleaving video frames and optical flow information in the
CLIP framework. Additionally, several temporal modeling schemes using an
aggregation of classifiers are proposed and compared: dense, semi dense, and
sparse. As a result, fine temporal actions can be correctly recognized, which
is of vital importance in animal behavior analysis. Experiments on the Animal
Kingdom dataset demonstrate that AnimalMotionCLIP achieves superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Automatic disease image grading is a significant application of artificial
intelligence for healthcare, enabling faster and more accurate patient
assessments. However, domain shifts, which are exacerbated by data imbalance,
introduce bias into the model, posing deployment difficulties in clinical
applications. To address the problem, we propose a novel
\textbf{U}ncertainty-aware \textbf{M}ulti-experts \textbf{K}nowledge
\textbf{D}istillation (UMKD) framework to transfer knowledge from multiple
expert models to a single student model. Specifically, to extract
discriminative features, UMKD decouples task-agnostic and task-specific
features with shallow and compact feature alignment in the feature space. At
the output space, an uncertainty-aware decoupled distillation (UDD) mechanism
dynamically adjusts knowledge transfer weights based on expert model
uncertainties, ensuring robust and reliable distillation. Additionally, UMKD
also tackles the problems of model architecture heterogeneity and distribution
discrepancies between source and target domains, which are inadequately tackled
by previous KD approaches. Extensive experiments on histology prostate grading
(\textit{SICAPv2}) and fundus image grading (\textit{APTOS}) demonstrate that
UMKD achieves a new state-of-the-art in both source-imbalanced and
target-imbalanced scenarios, offering a robust and practical solution for
real-world disease image grading.

Conclusion: 需定制化数据集和模型以优化内河航行预测，未来将扩展数据集并加入船舶分类以支持自主系统和人工操作。

Abstract: The future of inland navigation increasingly relies on autonomous systems and
remote operations, emphasizing the need for accurate vessel trajectory
prediction. This study addresses the challenges of video-based vessel tracking
and prediction by integrating advanced object detection methods, Kalman
filters, and spline-based interpolation. However, existing detection systems
often misclassify objects in inland waterways due to complex surroundings. A
comparative evaluation of tracking algorithms, including BoT-SORT, Deep
OC-SORT, and ByeTrack, highlights the robustness of the Kalman filter in
providing smoothed trajectories. Experimental results from diverse scenarios
demonstrate improved accuracy in predicting vessel movements, which is
essential for collision avoidance and situational awareness. The findings
underline the necessity of customized datasets and models for inland
navigation. Future work will expand the datasets and incorporate vessel
classification to refine predictions, supporting both autonomous systems and
human operators in complex environments.

Abstract: Monitoring dietary habits is crucial for preventing health risks associated
with overeating and undereating, including obesity, diabetes, and
cardiovascular diseases. Traditional methods for tracking food intake rely on
self-reported data before or after the eating, which are prone to inaccuracies.
This study proposes an approach to accurately monitor ingest behaviours by
leveraging 3D food models constructed from monocular 2D video. Using COLMAP and
pose estimation algorithms, we generate detailed 3D representations of food,
allowing us to observe changes in food volume as it is consumed. Experiments
with toy models and real food items demonstrate the approach's potential.
Meanwhile, we have proposed a new methodology for automated state recognition
challenges to accurately detect state changes and maintain model fidelity. The
3D reconstruction approach shows promise in capturing comprehensive dietary
behaviour insights, ultimately contributing to the development of automated and
accurate dietary monitoring tools.

Conclusion: Pixel3DMM为单图像3D人脸重建提供了高效且高精度的解决方案。

Abstract: We address the 3D reconstruction of human faces from a single RGB image. To
this end, we propose Pixel3DMM, a set of highly-generalized vision transformers
which predict per-pixel geometric cues in order to constrain the optimization
of a 3D morphable face model (3DMM). We exploit the latent features of the DINO
foundation model, and introduce a tailored surface normal and uv-coordinate
prediction head. We train our model by registering three high-quality 3D face
datasets against the FLAME mesh topology, which results in a total of over
1,000 identities and 976K images. For 3D face reconstruction, we propose a
FLAME fitting opitmization that solves for the 3DMM parameters from the
uv-coordinate and normal estimates. To evaluate our method, we introduce a new
benchmark for single-image face reconstruction, which features high diversity
facial expressions, viewing angles, and ethnicities. Crucially, our benchmark
is the first to evaluate both posed and neutral facial geometry. Ultimately,
our method outperforms the most competitive baselines by over 15% in terms of
geometric accuracy for posed facial expressions.

Conclusion: DSFAD有效解决了模态差异和风格噪声问题，提升了特征对齐和判别能力。

Abstract: Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification (VI-ReID) is a challenging task due
to the large modality discrepancy between visible and infrared images, which
complicates the alignment of their features into a suitable common space.
Moreover, style noise, such as illumination and color contrast, reduces the
identity discriminability and modality invariance of features. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Diverse Semantics-guided Feature Alignment and
Decoupling (DSFAD) network to align identity-relevant features from different
modalities into a textual embedding space and disentangle identity-irrelevant
features within each modality. Specifically, we develop a Diverse
Semantics-guided Feature Alignment (DSFA) module, which generates pedestrian
descriptions with diverse sentence structures to guide the cross-modality
alignment of visual features. Furthermore, to filter out style information, we
propose a Semantic Margin-guided Feature Decoupling (SMFD) module, which
decomposes visual features into pedestrian-related and style-related
components, and then constrains the similarity between the former and the
textual embeddings to be at least a margin higher than that between the latter
and the textual embeddings. Additionally, to prevent the loss of pedestrian
semantics during feature decoupling, we design a Semantic Consistency-guided
Feature Restitution (SCFR) module, which further excavates useful information
for identification from the style-related features and restores it back into
the pedestrian-related features, and then constrains the similarity between the
features after restitution and the textual embeddings to be consistent with
that between the features before decoupling and the textual embeddings.
Extensive experiments on three VI-ReID datasets demonstrate the superiority of
our DSFAD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前脑部基础模型存在任务和数据同质化、泛化能力有限及临床任务适应效率低的问题。

Method: SAM-Brain3D基于14种MRI子模态的6.6万张脑图像训练，HyDA通过超图动态适配器实现多模态数据融合和个性化适应。

Result: 实验表明该方法在多种脑疾病分割和分类任务中优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该框架为多模态、多尺度和动态基础建模提供了新范式。

Abstract: Brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and brain tumors, present
profound challenges due to their complexity and societal impact. Recent
advancements in brain foundation models have shown significant promise in
addressing a range of brain-related tasks. However, current brain foundation
models are limited by task and data homogeneity, restricted generalization
beyond segmentation or classification, and inefficient adaptation to diverse
clinical tasks. In this work, we propose SAM-Brain3D, a brain-specific
foundation model trained on over 66,000 brain image-label pairs across 14 MRI
sub-modalities, and Hypergraph Dynamic Adapter (HyDA), a lightweight adapter
for efficient and effective downstream adaptation. SAM-Brain3D captures
detailed brain-specific anatomical and modality priors for segmenting diverse
brain targets and broader downstream tasks. HyDA leverages hypergraphs to fuse
complementary multi-modal data and dynamically generate patient-specific
convolutional kernels for multi-scale feature fusion and personalized
patient-wise adaptation. Together, our framework excels across a broad spectrum
of brain disease segmentation and classification tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches, offering a new paradigm for brain disease analysis through
multi-modal, multi-scale, and dynamic foundation modeling.

Motivation: 解决CNN和ViT在遥感数据中的局限性，探索Mamba架构的潜力。

Method: 系统分析120项研究，构建分类体系，评估Mamba在多个任务中的表现。

Result: Mamba在遥感分析中表现出色，具有线性计算复杂度和全局上下文建模能力。

Conclusion: Mamba是遥感分析的变革性框架，为未来研究提供了结构化基础。

Abstract: Deep learning has profoundly transformed remote sensing, yet prevailing
architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers
(ViTs) remain constrained by critical trade-offs: CNNs suffer from limited
receptive fields, while ViTs grapple with quadratic computational complexity,
hindering their scalability for high-resolution remote sensing data. State
Space Models (SSMs), particularly the recently proposed Mamba architecture,
have emerged as a paradigm-shifting solution, combining linear computational
scaling with global context modeling. This survey presents a comprehensive
review of Mamba-based methodologies in remote sensing, systematically analyzing
about 120 studies to construct a holistic taxonomy of innovations and
applications. Our contributions are structured across five dimensions: (i)
foundational principles of vision Mamba architectures, (ii) micro-architectural
advancements such as adaptive scan strategies and hybrid SSM formulations,
(iii) macro-architectural integrations, including CNN-Transformer-Mamba hybrids
and frequency-domain adaptations, (iv) rigorous benchmarking against
state-of-the-art methods in multiple application tasks, such as object
detection, semantic segmentation, change detection, etc. and (v) critical
analysis of unresolved challenges with actionable future directions. By
bridging the gap between SSM theory and remote sensing practice, this survey
establishes Mamba as a transformative framework for remote sensing analysis. To
our knowledge, this paper is the first systematic review of Mamba architectures
in remote sensing. Our work provides a structured foundation for advancing
research in remote sensing systems through SSM-based methods. We curate an
open-source repository

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度强化学习（DRL）的框架，用于优化德里市空气净化亭的布局，以改善空气质量指数（AQI）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 德里作为全球污染最严重的城市之一，传统静态空气净化设施因布局不合理和适应性差，效果有限。

Method: 采用近端策略优化（PPO）算法，结合人口密度、交通模式等环境因素，动态学习高影响区域。

Result: DRL框架在AQI改善、空间覆盖等方面优于传统方法，实现了均衡高效的净化设施分布。

Conclusion: AI驱动的空间优化为智能城市和数据驱动的空气质量治理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Urban air pollution remains a pressing global concern, particularly in
densely populated and traffic-intensive metropolitan areas like Delhi, where
exposure to harmful pollutants severely impacts public health. Delhi, being one
of the most polluted cities globally, experiences chronic air quality issues
due to vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and construction dust, which
exacerbate its already fragile atmospheric conditions. Traditional pollution
mitigation strategies, such as static air purifying installations, often fail
to maximize their impact due to suboptimal placement and limited adaptability
to dynamic urban environments. This study presents a novel deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) framework to optimize the placement of air purification booths
to improve the air quality index (AQI) in the city of Delhi. We employ Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm,
to iteratively learn and identify high-impact locations based on multiple
spatial and environmental factors, including population density, traffic
patterns, industrial influence, and green space constraints. Our approach is
benchmarked against conventional placement strategies, including random and
greedy AQI-based methods, using multi-dimensional performance evaluation
metrics such as AQI improvement, spatial coverage, population and traffic
impact, and spatial entropy. Experimental results demonstrate that the RL-based
approach outperforms baseline methods by achieving a balanced and effective
distribution of air purification infrastructure. Notably, the DRL framework
achieves an optimal trade-off between AQI reduction and high-coverage
deployment, ensuring equitable environmental benefits across urban regions. The
findings underscore the potential of AI-driven spatial optimization in
advancing smart city initiatives and data-driven urban air quality management.

Motivation: 网页的视觉复杂性和大量界面元素使得动作选择困难，因此需要一种方法减少干扰并提升准确性。

Method: 提出RegionFocus方法，动态缩放相关区域，并引入图像地图机制可视化关键地标，提供透明动作记录。

Result: 在Screenspot-pro和WebVoyager基准测试中，性能分别提升28%和24%，并在ScreenSpot-Pro上达到61.6%的最新性能。

Conclusion: RegionFocus通过视觉测试时缩放显著提升了视觉语言模型代理的性能，证明了其在交互式环境中的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce RegionFocus, a visual test-time scaling approach for Vision
Language Model Agents. Understanding webpages is challenging due to the visual
complexity of GUI images and the large number of interface elements, making
accurate action selection difficult. Our approach dynamically zooms in on
relevant regions, reducing background clutter and improving grounding accuracy.
To support this process, we propose an image-as-map mechanism that visualizes
key landmarks at each step, providing a transparent action record and enables
the agent to effectively choose among action candidates. Even with a simple
region selection strategy, we observe significant performance gains of 28+\% on
Screenspot-pro and 24+\% on WebVoyager benchmarks on top of two
state-of-the-art open vision language model agents, UI-TARS and Qwen2.5-VL,
highlighting the effectiveness of visual test-time scaling in interactive
settings. We achieve a new state-of-the-art grounding performance of 61.6\% on
the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark by applying RegionFocus to a Qwen2.5-VL-72B model.
Our code will be released publicly at https://github.com/tiangeluo/RegionFocus.

Motivation: 当前微型移动设备依赖人工操作，存在安全和效率问题。AI辅助操作是潜在解决方案，但需要高效模拟环境支持。

Method: 构建URBAN-SIM模拟平台（包含三个模块）和URBAN-BENCH基准测试（包含八项任务），评估四种机器人在多样化城市环境中的表现。

Conclusion: URBAN-SIM和URBAN-BENCH为微型移动设备的自主性研究提供了高效工具，推动了AI在城市移动领域的应用。

Abstract: Micromobility, which utilizes lightweight mobile machines moving in urban
public spaces, such as delivery robots and mobility scooters, emerges as a
promising alternative to vehicular mobility. Current micromobility depends
mostly on human manual operation (in-person or remote control), which raises
safety and efficiency concerns when navigating busy urban environments full of
unpredictable obstacles and pedestrians. Assisting humans with AI agents in
maneuvering micromobility devices presents a viable solution for enhancing
safety and efficiency. In this work, we present a scalable urban simulation
solution to advance autonomous micromobility. First, we build URBAN-SIM - a
high-performance robot learning platform for large-scale training of embodied
agents in interactive urban scenes. URBAN-SIM contains three critical modules:
Hierarchical Urban Generation pipeline, Interactive Dynamics Generation
strategy, and Asynchronous Scene Sampling scheme, to improve the diversity,
realism, and efficiency of robot learning in simulation. Then, we propose
URBAN-BENCH - a suite of essential tasks and benchmarks to gauge various
capabilities of the AI agents in achieving autonomous micromobility.
URBAN-BENCH includes eight tasks based on three core skills of the agents:
Urban Locomotion, Urban Navigation, and Urban Traverse. We evaluate four robots
with heterogeneous embodiments, such as the wheeled and legged robots, across
these tasks. Experiments on diverse terrains and urban structures reveal each
robot's strengths and limitations.

TL;DR: RayZer是一个无需3D监督的自监督多视角3D视觉模型，能够从未标注的图像中恢复相机参数并合成新视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖3D标注（如相机位姿和场景几何），RayZer旨在通过自监督学习实现3D感知，减少对标注数据的依赖。

Method: 设计了一个自监督框架，通过解耦相机和场景表示实现3D感知自动编码，并使用基于Transformer的模型，仅依赖射线结构作为3D先验。

Result: RayZer在无需真实相机位姿的情况下，表现出与依赖标注的方法相当甚至更优的新视角合成性能。

Conclusion: RayZer展示了自监督学习在3D视觉任务中的潜力，为减少对标注数据的依赖提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present RayZer, a self-supervised multi-view 3D Vision model trained
without any 3D supervision, i.e., camera poses and scene geometry, while
exhibiting emerging 3D awareness. Concretely, RayZer takes unposed and
uncalibrated images as input, recovers camera parameters, reconstructs a scene
representation, and synthesizes novel views. During training, RayZer relies
solely on its self-predicted camera poses to render target views, eliminating
the need for any ground-truth camera annotations and allowing RayZer to be
trained with 2D image supervision. The emerging 3D awareness of RayZer is
attributed to two key factors. First, we design a self-supervised framework,
which achieves 3D-aware auto-encoding of input images by disentangling camera
and scene representations. Second, we design a transformer-based model in which
the only 3D prior is the ray structure, connecting camera, pixel, and scene
simultaneously. RayZer demonstrates comparable or even superior novel view
synthesis performance than ``oracle'' methods that rely on pose annotations in
both training and testing. Project: https://hwjiang1510.github.io/RayZer/

Result: 在T2I-CompBench和WISE基准上分别提升13%和19%，超越FLUX.1。

Conclusion: T2I-R1通过双层CoT和RL显著提升文本到图像生成性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models have demonstrated how
chain-of-thought (CoT) and reinforcement learning (RL) can improve performance.
However, applying such reasoning strategies to the visual generation domain
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present T2I-R1, a novel
reasoning-enhanced text-to-image generation model, powered by RL with a
bi-level CoT reasoning process. Specifically, we identify two levels of CoT
that can be utilized to enhance different stages of generation: (1) the
semantic-level CoT for high-level planning of the prompt and (2) the
token-level CoT for low-level pixel processing during patch-by-patch
generation. To better coordinate these two levels of CoT, we introduce
BiCoT-GRPO with an ensemble of generation rewards, which seamlessly optimizes
both generation CoTs within the same training step. By applying our reasoning
strategies to the baseline model, Janus-Pro, we achieve superior performance
with 13% improvement on T2I-CompBench and 19% improvement on the WISE
benchmark, even surpassing the state-of-the-art model FLUX.1. Code is available

Motivation: 研究旨在验证多时相卫星影像和NDVI堆栈在农田边界划分中的有效性，并探索跨地理区域的模型迁移学习能力。

Method: 使用UNET架构的四种深度学习模型，结合多时相影像和NDVI堆栈，分别在荷兰和巴基斯坦进行训练和评估。

Result: 多时相NDVI堆栈提供了作物生长的时序信息，模型在荷兰和巴基斯坦均表现良好，且高空间分辨率对小规模农田边界提取至关重要。

Conclusion: 多时相影像和多尺度地面数据对开发通用的农田边界划分模型具有重要作用，研究结果可推广至异质农业环境。

Abstract: This study explores the effectiveness of multi-temporal satellite imagery for
better functional field boundary delineation using deep learning semantic
segmentation architecture on two distinct geographical and multi-scale farming
systems of Netherlands and Pakistan. Multidate images of April, August and
October 2022 were acquired for PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 in sub regions of
Netherlands and November 2022, February and March 2023 for selected area of
Dunyapur in Pakistan. For Netherlands, Basic registration crop parcels (BRP)
vector layer was used as labeled training data. while self-crafted field
boundary vector data were utilized for Pakistan. Four deep learning models with
UNET architecture were evaluated using different combinations of multi-date
images and NDVI stacks in the Netherlands subregions. A comparative analysis of
IoU scores assessed the effectiveness of the proposed multi-date NDVI stack
approach. These findings were then applied for transfer learning, using
pre-trained models from the Netherlands on the selected area in Pakistan.
Additionally, separate models were trained using self-crafted field boundary
data for Pakistan, and combined models were developed using data from both the
Netherlands and Pakistan. Results indicate that multi-date NDVI stacks provide
additional temporal context, reflecting crop growth over different times of the
season. The study underscores the critical role of multi-scale ground
information from diverse geographical areas in developing robust and
universally applicable models for field boundary delineation. The results also
highlight the importance of fine spatial resolution for extraction of field
boundaries in regions with small scale framing. The findings can be extended to
multi-scale implementations for improved automatic field boundary delineation
in heterogeneous agricultural environments.

Conclusion: 本文为人类认知与AI能力的深度协同进化提供了重要基石。

Abstract: This position paper critically surveys a broad spectrum of recent empirical
developments on human-AI agents collaboration, highlighting both their
technical achievements and persistent gaps. We observe a lack of a unifying
theoretical framework that can coherently integrate these varied studies,
especially when tackling open-ended, complex tasks. To address this, we propose
a novel conceptual architecture: one that systematically interlinks the
technical details of multi-agent coordination, knowledge management, cybernetic
feedback loops, and higher-level control mechanisms. By mapping existing
contributions, from symbolic AI techniques and connectionist LLM-based agents
to hybrid organizational practices, onto this proposed framework (Hierarchical
Exploration-Exploitation Net), our approach facilitates revision of legacy
methods and inspires new work that fuses qualitative and quantitative
paradigms. The paper's structure allows it to be read from any section, serving
equally as a critical review of technical implementations and as a
forward-looking reference for designing or extending human-AI symbioses.
Together, these insights offer a stepping stone toward deeper co-evolution of

Method: 结合模糊语义和一阶逻辑，定义了一种表示空间实体及其关系的语言，并提出了空间推理算法用于神经分割与识别。

Result: 该方法在儿科影像中的盆腔神经识别中得到了验证，帮助外科医生进行手术规划。

Conclusion: 通过模糊逻辑形式化解剖知识，可以有效识别医学图像中的神经纤维束，为手术规划提供支持。

Abstract: This article deals with the description and recognition of fiber bundles, in
particular nerves, in medical images, based on the anatomical description of
the fiber trajectories. To this end, we propose a logical formalization of this
anatomical knowledge. The intrinsically imprecise description of nerves, as
found in anatomical textbooks, leads us to propose fuzzy semantics combined
with first-order logic. We define a language representing spatial entities,
relations between these entities and quantifiers. A formula in this language is
then a formalization of the natural language description. The semantics are
given by fuzzy representations in a concrete domain and satisfaction degrees of
relations. Based on this formalization, a spatial reasoning algorithm is
proposed for segmentation and recognition of nerves from anatomical and
diffusion magnetic resonance images, which is illustrated on pelvic nerves in
pediatric imaging, enabling surgeons to plan surgery.

Conclusion: 建议提高部署数据的透明度和系统性观察，以弥补知识缺口。

Abstract: Drawing on 1,178 safety and reliability papers from 9,439 generative AI
papers (January 2020 - March 2025), we compare research outputs of leading AI
companies (Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI) and AI
universities (CMU, MIT, NYU, Stanford, UC Berkeley, and University of
Washington). We find that corporate AI research increasingly concentrates on
pre-deployment areas -- model alignment and testing & evaluation -- while
attention to deployment-stage issues such as model bias has waned. Significant
research gaps exist in high-risk deployment domains, including healthcare,
finance, misinformation, persuasive and addictive features, hallucinations, and
copyright. Without improved observability into deployed AI, growing corporate
concentration could deepen knowledge deficits. We recommend expanding external
researcher access to deployment data and systematic observability of in-market
AI behaviors.

apply this framework to Anthropic's "Values in the Wild" dataset, containing
over 308,000 anonymized conversations with Claude and more than 3,000 annotated
value expressions. Our study maps these values to RAIL dimensions, computes
synthetic scores, and provides insights into the ethical behavior of LLMs in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视缺陷特征、历史故障和工程师经验的整合，限制了IC处理的效率提升。

Result: DeCo在真实数据集上任务处理成功率超过80%，且能平衡工作负载。

Conclusion: DeCo是一种高效的AI驱动解决方案，适用于IC故障分析和任务处理。

Abstract: In the semiconductor industry, integrated circuit (IC) processes play a vital
role, as the rising complexity and market expectations necessitate improvements
in yield. Identifying IC defects and assigning IC testing tasks to the right
engineers improves efficiency and reduces losses. While current studies
emphasize fault localization or defect classification, they overlook the
integration of defect characteristics, historical failures, and the insights
from engineer expertise, which restrains their effectiveness in improving IC
handling. To leverage AI for these challenges, we propose DeCo, an innovative
approach for optimizing task assignment in IC testing. DeCo constructs a novel
defect-aware graph from IC testing reports, capturing co-failure relationships
to enhance defect differentiation, even with scarce defect data. Additionally,
it formulates defect-aware representations for engineers and tasks, reinforced
by local and global structure modeling on the defect-aware graph. Finally, a
contrasting-based assignment mechanism pairs testing tasks with QA engineers by
considering their skill level and current workload, thus promoting an equitable
and efficient job dispatch. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate
that DeCo achieves the highest task-handling success rates in different
scenarios, exceeding 80\%, while also maintaining balanced workloads on both
scarce or expanded defect data. Moreover, case studies reveal that DeCo can
assign tasks to potentially capable engineers, even for their unfamiliar
defects, highlighting its potential as an AI-driven solution for the real-world
IC failure analysis and task handling.

Result: CognitionNet能揭示玩家心理和战术，并在玩家参与预测中提供解释，性能显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CognitionNet首次实现了从遥测数据中自动化发现玩家心理和战术，为游戏平台提供了新的分析工具。

Abstract: Games are one of the safest source of realizing self-esteem and relaxation at
the same time. An online gaming platform typically has massive data coming in,
e.g., in-game actions, player moves, clickstreams, transactions etc. It is
rather interesting, as something as simple as data on gaming moves can help
create a psychological imprint of the user at that moment, based on her
impulsive reactions and response to a situation in the game. Mining this
knowledge can: (a) immediately help better explain observed and predicted
player behavior; and (b) consequently propel deeper understanding towards
players' experience, growth and protection. To this effect, we focus on
discovery of the "game behaviours" as micro-patterns formed by continuous
sequence of games and the persistent "play styles" of the players' as a
sequence of such sequences on an online skill gaming platform for Rummy. We
propose a two stage deep neural network, CognitionNet. The first stage focuses
on mining game behaviours as cluster representations in a latent space while
the second aggregates over these micro patterns to discover play styles via a
supervised classification objective around player engagement. The dual
objective allows CognitionNet to reveal several player psychology inspired
decision making and tactics. To our knowledge, this is the first and

*Ahmed R. Sadik,Muhammad Ashfaq,Niko Mäkitalo,Tommi Mikkonen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的智能整体架构，用于解决城市空中交通（UAM）的复杂性问题，通过案例研究展示了其动态资源分配和实时调整的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统架构在动态复杂环境中难以实现可扩展性、适应性和资源无缝集成，因此需要一种新方法来解决UAM的系统架构、规划和任务管理问题。

Method: 采用智能整体架构，结合LLM处理自然语言输入、生成自适应计划并管理中断（如天气变化或空域关闭），实现半自主运行的实时协调。

Result: 通过多模式交通案例研究（电动滑板车和空中出租车），验证了该架构的动态资源分配、实时重新规划和自主适应能力，无需集中控制。

Conclusion: 该研究为去中心化控制和AI驱动的适应性UAM生态系统奠定了基础，未来工作将关注混合AI集成和实际验证。

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an emerging System of System (SoS) that faces
challenges in system architecture, planning, task management, and execution.
Traditional architectural approaches struggle with scalability, adaptability,
and seamless resource integration within dynamic and complex environments. This
paper presents an intelligent holonic architecture that incorporates Large
Language Model (LLM) to manage the complexities of UAM. Holons function semi
autonomously, allowing for real time coordination among air taxis, ground
transport, and vertiports. LLMs process natural language inputs, generate
adaptive plans, and manage disruptions such as weather changes or airspace
closures.Through a case study of multimodal transportation with electric
scooters and air taxis, we demonstrate how this architecture enables dynamic
resource allocation, real time replanning, and autonomous adaptation without
centralized control, creating more resilient and efficient urban transportation
networks. By advancing decentralized control and AI driven adaptability, this
work lays the groundwork for resilient, human centric UAM ecosystems, with
future efforts targeting hybrid AI integration and real world validation.

TL;DR: ScaleTrack是一个自动化GUI代理的训练框架，通过扩展GUI定位和回溯规划来解决数据不足和忽略历史行为的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理在定位和规划阶段存在数据不足和忽略历史行为的局限性。

Method: ScaleTrack通过统一收集多样化的GUI样本并设计回溯规划策略，结合当前GUI图像和历史动作预测下一步动作。

Result: 实验证明ScaleTrack有效描述了GUI环境演变规则，提升了性能。

Conclusion: ScaleTrack为自动化GUI代理提供了一种有效的训练框架，解决了现有问题。

Abstract: Automated GUI agents aims to facilitate user interaction by automatically
performing complex tasks in digital environments, such as web, mobile, desktop
devices. It receives textual task instruction and GUI description to generate
executable actions (\emph{e.g.}, click) and operation boxes step by step.
Training a GUI agent mainly involves grounding and planning stages, in which
the GUI grounding focuses on finding the execution coordinates according to the
task, while the planning stage aims to predict the next action based on
historical actions. However, previous work suffers from the limitations of
insufficient training data for GUI grounding, as well as the ignorance of
backtracking historical behaviors for GUI planning. To handle the above
challenges, we propose ScaleTrack, a training framework by scaling grounding
and backtracking planning for automated GUI agents. We carefully collected GUI
samples of different synthesis criterions from a wide range of sources, and
unified them into the same template for training GUI grounding models.
Moreover, we design a novel training strategy that predicts the next action
from the current GUI image, while also backtracking the historical actions that
led to the GUI image. In this way, ScaleTrack explains the correspondence
between GUI images and actions, which effectively describes the evolution rules
of the GUI environment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of ScaleTrack. Data and code will be available at url.

Abstract: Agentic AI, with its autonomous and proactive decision-making, has
transformed smart environments. By integrating Generative AI (GenAI) and
multi-agent systems, modern AI frameworks can dynamically adapt to user
preferences, optimize data management, and improve resource allocation. This
paper introduces UserCentrix, an agentic memory-augmented AI framework designed

leverage user preferences and LLM memory management to deliver proactive and
adaptive assistance. Furthermore, it incorporates a hybrid hierarchical control
system, balancing centralized and distributed processing to optimize real-time
responsiveness while maintaining global situational awareness. UserCentrix

strategies. Our key contributions include (i) a self-organizing framework with
proactive scaling based on task urgency, (ii) a Value of Information
(VoI)-driven decision-making process, (iii) a meta-reasoning personal LLM
agent, and (iv) an intelligent multi-agent coordination system for seamless
environment adaptation. Experimental results across various models confirm the
effectiveness of our approach in enhancing response accuracy, system
efficiency, and computational resource management in real-world application.

Motivation: 现有分类器仅基于事实，而法律推理依赖事实与规则（如判决理由），需扩展框架以更准确模拟法律决策。

Method: 基于Canavotto等人的规则推理模型，构建结合规则与事实的分类器框架，并引入时间因素和法院层级。

Result: 展示了如何在新框架中推断新案件决策，并举例说明时间和法院层级的作用。

Conclusion: 扩展的分类器框架更贴近法律推理实际，为法律决策提供更全面的支持。

Abstract: We extend the formal framework of classifier models used in the legal domain.
While the existing classifier framework characterises cases solely through the
facts involved, legal reasoning fundamentally relies on both facts and rules,
particularly the ratio decidendi. This paper presents an initial approach to
incorporating sets of rules within a classifier. Our work is built on the work
of Canavotto et al. (2023), which has developed the rule-based reason model of
precedential constraint within a hierarchy of factors. We demonstrate how
decisions for new cases can be inferred using this enriched rule-based
classifier framework. Additionally, we provide an example of how the time
element and the hierarchy of courts can be used in the new classifier
framework.

TL;DR: GPT4在类比推理中召回率高但精确度低，人类则相反。研究指出AI适合生成类比，人类更适合评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究GPT4在战略决策中的类比推理能力是否接近人类。

Method: 采用源目标匹配实验设计，对比GPT4与人类的表现。

Result: GPT4召回率高但精确度低，人类精确度高但召回率低。AI错误源于表面匹配，人类错误源于因果误解。

Conclusion: AI适合生成类比，人类适合评估，二者可互补用于决策。

Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models, specifically GPT4, can
match human capabilities in analogical reasoning within strategic decision
making contexts. Using a novel experimental design involving source to target
matching, we find that GPT4 achieves high recall by retrieving all plausible
analogies but suffers from low precision, frequently applying incorrect
analogies based on superficial similarities. In contrast, human participants
exhibit high precision but low recall, selecting fewer analogies yet with
stronger causal alignment. These findings advance theory by identifying
matching, the evaluative phase of analogical reasoning, as a distinct step that
requires accurate causal mapping beyond simple retrieval. While current LLMs
are proficient in generating candidate analogies, humans maintain a comparative
advantage in recognizing deep structural similarities across domains. Error
analysis reveals that AI errors arise from surface level matching, whereas
human errors stem from misinterpretations of causal structure. Taken together,
the results suggest a productive division of labor in AI assisted
organizational decision making where LLMs may serve as broad analogy
generators, while humans act as critical evaluators, applying the most
contextually appropriate analogies to strategic problems.

Abstract: In response to the lack of trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI) for
sequential planning, we design a Computational Tree Logic-guided large language
model (LLM)-based natural language explanation framework designed for the Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. MCTS is often considered challenging to
interpret due to the complexity of its search trees, but our framework is
flexible enough to handle a wide range of free-form post-hoc queries and
knowledge-based inquiries centered around MCTS and the Markov Decision Process
(MDP) of the application domain. By transforming user queries into logic and
variable statements, our framework ensures that the evidence obtained from the
search tree remains factually consistent with the underlying environmental
dynamics and any constraints in the actual stochastic control process. We
evaluate the framework rigorously through quantitative assessments, where it
demonstrates strong performance in terms of accuracy and factual consistency.

Motivation: 生成式AI模型的输入输出空间无界、缺乏明确真实目标，且存在反馈循环和预测依赖，传统评估方法不足以应对这些挑战。

Result: AI竞赛的实践为解决生成式AI评估中的泄漏和污染问题提供了有效方案。

Conclusion: 生成式AI领域应将AI竞赛视为评估严谨性的标杆，并借鉴其方法。

Abstract: In this position paper, we observe that empirical evaluation in Generative AI
is at a crisis point since traditional ML evaluation and benchmarking
strategies are insufficient to meet the needs of evaluating modern GenAI models
and systems. There are many reasons for this, including the fact that these
models typically have nearly unbounded input and output spaces, typically do
not have a well defined ground truth target, and typically exhibit strong
feedback loops and prediction dependence based on context of previous model
outputs. On top of these critical issues, we argue that the problems of {\em
leakage} and {\em contamination} are in fact the most important and difficult
issues to address for GenAI evaluations. Interestingly, the field of AI
Competitions has developed effective measures and practices to combat leakage
for the purpose of counteracting cheating by bad actors within a competition
setting. This makes AI Competitions an especially valuable (but underutilized)
resource. Now is time for the field to view AI Competitions as the gold
standard for empirical rigor in GenAI evaluation, and to harness and harvest
their results with according value.

Motivation: 现有集中式IoV解决方案存在高延迟、可扩展性差和依赖专有AI模型的问题，阻碍了在动态和隐私敏感环境中的广泛应用。

Method: FPoTT结合动态提示优化机制和双层联邦学习范式，利用开源LLM进行轨迹预测，并通过Transformer生成合成数据增强训练。

Conclusion: 开源LLM在安全、自适应和可扩展的IoV管理中具有潜力，为智能交通生态系统提供了替代专有解决方案的可行选择。

Abstract: The proliferation of connected vehicles within the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)
ecosystem presents critical challenges in ensuring scalable, real-time, and
privacy-preserving traffic management. Existing centralized IoV solutions often
suffer from high latency, limited scalability, and reliance on proprietary
Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, creating significant barriers to
widespread deployment, particularly in dynamic and privacy-sensitive
environments. Meanwhile, integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in vehicular
systems remains underexplored, especially concerning prompt optimization and
effective utilization in federated contexts. To address these challenges, we
propose the Federated Prompt-Optimized Traffic Transformer (FPoTT), a novel
framework that leverages open-source LLMs for predictive IoV management. FPoTT
introduces a dynamic prompt optimization mechanism that iteratively refines
textual prompts to enhance trajectory prediction. The architecture employs a
dual-layer federated learning paradigm, combining lightweight edge models for
real-time inference with cloud-based LLMs to retain global intelligence. A
Transformer-driven synthetic data generator is incorporated to augment training
with diverse, high-fidelity traffic scenarios in the Next Generation Simulation
(NGSIM) format. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that FPoTT, utilizing
EleutherAI Pythia-1B, achieves 99.86% prediction accuracy on real-world data
while maintaining high performance on synthetic datasets. These results
underscore the potential of open-source LLMs in enabling secure, adaptive, and
scalable IoV management, offering a promising alternative to proprietary
solutions in smart mobility ecosystems.

Conclusion: 该框架将实验室级精度与日常可访问性结合，为精英运动员和健身爱好者提供先进的代谢监测工具。

Abstract: Understanding physiological responses during running is critical for
performance optimization, tailored training prescriptions, and athlete health
management. We introduce a comprehensive framework -- what we believe to be the
first capable of predicting instantaneous oxygen consumption (VO$_{2}$)
trajectories exclusively from consumer-grade wearable data. Our approach
employs two complementary physiological models: (1) accurate modeling of heart
rate (HR) dynamics via a physiologically constrained ordinary differential
equation (ODE) and neural Kalman filter, trained on over 3 million HR
observations, achieving 1-second interval predictions with mean absolute errors
as low as 2.81\,bpm (correlation 0.87); and (2) leveraging the principles of
precise HR modeling, a novel VO$_{2}$ prediction architecture requiring only
the initial second of VO$_{2}$ data for calibration, enabling robust,
sequence-to-sequence metabolic demand estimation. Despite relying solely on
smartwatch and chest-strap data, our method achieves mean absolute percentage
errors of approximately 13\%, effectively capturing rapid physiological
transitions and steady-state conditions across diverse running intensities. Our
synchronized dataset, complemented by blood lactate measurements, further lays
the foundation for future noninvasive metabolic zone identification. By
embedding physiological constraints within modern machine learning, this
framework democratizes advanced metabolic monitoring, bridging laboratory-grade
accuracy and everyday accessibility, thus empowering both elite athletes and
recreational fitness enthusiasts.

Conclusion: EnGM-PHD滤波器在多目标滤波中表现优越，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In this work, a kernel-based Ensemble Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis
Density (EnGM-PHD) filter is presented for multi-target filtering applications.
The EnGM-PHD filter combines the Gaussian-mixture-based techniques of the
Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density (GM-PHD) filter with the
particle-based techniques of the Sequential Monte Carlo Probability Hypothesis
Density (SMC-PHD) filter. It achieves this by obtaining particles from the
posterior intensity function, propagating them through the system dynamics, and
then using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) techniques to approximate the
Gaussian mixture of the prior intensity function. This approach guarantees
convergence to the true intensity function in the limit of the number of
components. Moreover, in the special case of a single target with no births,
deaths, clutter, and perfect detection probability, the EnGM-PHD filter reduces
to the standard Ensemble Gaussian Mixture Filter (EnGMF). In the presented
experiment, the results indicate that the EnGM-PHD filter achieves better
multi-target filtering performance than both the GM-PHD and SMC-PHD filters
while using the same number of components or particles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Python是AI开发的主流语言，但现有库（如PyTorch、TensorFlow）仅依赖BLAS后端的并行化可能导致性能和扩展性下降。

Method: 使用pybind11将基于HPX的异步C++代码绑定到Python API，开发并行高斯过程库GPRat。

Result: GPRat在64核AMD EPYC 7742 CPU上表现出优于GPyTorch和GPflow的扩展性和预测速度（最高25.25倍加速）。

Conclusion: 异步任务在Python AI应用中有巨大潜力，GPRat展示了高性能和易用性的结合。

Abstract: Python is the de-facto language for software development in artificial
intelligence (AI). Commonly used libraries, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow,
rely on parallelization built into their BLAS backends to achieve speedup on
CPUs. However, only applying parallelization in a low-level backend can lead to
performance and scaling degradation. In this work, we present a novel way of
binding task-based C++ code built on the asynchronous runtime model HPX to a
high-level Python API using pybind11. We develop a parallel Gaussian process
(GP) li- brary as an application. The resulting Python library GPRat combines
the ease of use of commonly available GP libraries with the performance and
scalability of asynchronous runtime systems. We evaluate the per- formance on a
mass-spring-damper system, a standard benchmark from control theory, for
varying numbers of regressors (features). The results show almost no binding
overhead when binding the asynchronous HPX code using pybind11. Compared to
GPyTorch and GPflow, GPRat shows superior scaling on up to 64 cores on an AMD
EPYC 7742 CPU for train- ing. Furthermore, our library achieves a prediction
speedup of 7.63 over GPyTorch and 25.25 over GPflow. If we increase the number
of features from eight to 128, we observe speedups of 29.62 and 21.19,
respectively. These results showcase the potential of using asynchronous tasks
within Python-based AI applications.

Motivation: 解决高计算成本目标函数和梯度评估的优化问题，尤其是在梯度不可访问时，零阶方法的性能受限于高函数查询成本。

Conclusion: BF-SSD通过双保真度策略在零阶优化中表现出高效性，适用于大规模高维实际问题。

Abstract: Efficient optimization remains a fundamental challenge across numerous
scientific and engineering domains, especially when objective function and
gradient evaluations are computationally expensive. While zeroth-order
optimization methods offer effective approaches when gradients are
inaccessible, their practical performance can be limited by the high cost
associated with function queries. This work introduces the bi-fidelity
stochastic subspace descent (BF-SSD) algorithm, a novel zeroth-order
optimization method designed to reduce this computational burden. BF-SSD
leverages a bi-fidelity framework, constructing a surrogate model from a
combination of computationally inexpensive low-fidelity (LF) and accurate
high-fidelity (HF) function evaluations. This surrogate model facilitates an
efficient backtracking line search for step size selection, for which we
provide theoretical convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. We
perform a comprehensive empirical evaluation of BF-SSD across four distinct
problems: a synthetic optimization benchmark, dual-form kernel ridge
regression, black-box adversarial attacks on machine learning models, and
transformer-based black-box language model fine-tuning. Numerical results
demonstrate that BF-SSD consistently achieves superior optimization performance
while requiring significantly fewer HF function evaluations compared to
relevant baseline methods. This study highlights the efficacy of integrating
bi-fidelity strategies within zeroth-order optimization, positioning BF-SSD as
a promising and computationally efficient approach for tackling large-scale,
high-dimensional problems encountered in various real-world applications.

Result: 模型准确率达70%，优于传统方法，并识别出手术时长和住院时间等新影响因素。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提升预测性能，还为临床医生提供了患者特异性见解，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is a relentless challenge in
oncology, with recurrence rates soaring as high as 70-80%. Each recurrence
triggers a cascade of invasive procedures, lifelong surveillance, and
escalating healthcare costs - affecting 460,000 individuals worldwide. However,
existing clinical prediction tools remain fundamentally flawed, often
overestimating recurrence risk and failing to provide personalized insights for
patient management. In this work, we propose an interpretable deep learning
framework that integrates vector embeddings and attention mechanisms to improve
NMIBC recurrence prediction performance. We incorporate vector embeddings for
categorical variables such as smoking status and intravesical treatments,
allowing the model to capture complex relationships between patient attributes
and recurrence risk. These embeddings provide a richer representation of the
data, enabling improved feature interactions and enhancing prediction
performance. Our approach not only enhances performance but also provides
clinicians with patient-specific insights by highlighting the most influential
features contributing to recurrence risk for each patient. Our model achieves
accuracy of 70% with tabular data, outperforming conventional statistical
methods while providing clinician-friendly patient-level explanations through
feature attention. Unlike previous studies, our approach identifies new
important factors influencing recurrence, such as surgical duration and
hospital stay, which had not been considered in existing NMIBC prediction
models.

Abstract: Chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney
disease, and thyroid disorders, are the leading causes of premature mortality
worldwide. Early detection and intervention are crucial for improving patient
outcomes, yet traditional diagnostic methods often fail due to the complex
nature of these conditions. This study explores the application of machine
learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to predict chronic disease and
thyroid disorders. We used a variety of models, including Logistic Regression
(LR), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT), Neural Networks (NN),
Decision Trees (DT) and Native Bayes (NB), to analyze and predict disease
outcomes. Our methodology involved comprehensive data pre-processing, including
handling missing values, categorical encoding, and feature aggregation,
followed by model training and evaluation. Performance metrics such ad
precision, recall, accuracy, F1-score, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) were used
to assess the effectiveness of each model. The results demonstrated that
ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Trees consistently

TL;DR: 稀疏自编码器（SAEs）通过字典学习从神经网络中提取可解释特征，但计算成本高。研究发现字典重要性遵循幂律，比较了基于子集修剪的渐进编码与嵌套SAEs（Matryoshka SAEs），后者在重建损失和语言建模任务中表现更好，但修剪后的普通SAEs更具可解释性。

Motivation: 探索如何高效地从神经网络中提取可解释特征，同时解决稀疏自编码器计算成本高的问题。

Method: 比较了基于子集修剪的渐进编码与嵌套SAEs（Matryoshka SAEs）在语言建模任务中的表现。

Result: Matryoshka SAEs在重建损失和语言建模任务中表现更优，但修剪后的普通SAEs更具可解释性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了在性能和可解释性之间的权衡，讨论了其起源和意义。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
\citep{bricken2023monosemanticity,gao2024scalingevaluatingsparseautoencoders}
rely on dictionary learning to extract interpretable features from neural
networks at scale in an unsupervised manner, with applications to
representation engineering and information retrieval. SAEs are, however,
computationally expensive \citep{lieberum2024gemmascopeopensparse}, especially
when multiple SAEs of different sizes are needed. We show that dictionary
importance in vanilla SAEs follows a power law. We compare progressive coding
based on subset pruning of SAEs -- to jointly training nested SAEs, or
so-called {\em Matryoshka} SAEs
\citep{bussmann2024learning,nabeshima2024Matryoshka} -- on a language modeling
task. We show Matryoshka SAEs exhibit lower reconstruction loss and recaptured
language modeling loss, as well as higher representational similarity. Pruned
vanilla SAEs are more interpretable, however. We discuss the origins and
implications of this trade-off.

TL;DR: 提出了一种能够捕捉个体化空间变化的流形学习框架，适用于结构化和非结构化神经影像数据，并在模拟和真实数据中表现优于群体基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于群体空间对齐或时间结构化数据，无法有效捕捉个体差异，因此需要一种新框架来解决这一问题。

Method: 开发了一种流形学习框架，适用于结构化和非结构化神经影像数据，并在模拟和真实fMRI数据集上验证其性能。

Result: 框架在模拟和真实数据中表现优异，能够高效扩展到大数据集并泛化到新受试者，揭示了与临床相关的个体化脑活动模式。

Conclusion: 该框架为建模脑活动提供了可扩展且个体化的方法，适用于计算神经科学和临床研究。

Abstract: Mental and cognitive representations are believed to reside on
low-dimensional, non-linear manifolds embedded within high-dimensional brain
activity. Uncovering these manifolds is key to understanding individual
differences in brain function, yet most existing machine learning methods
either rely on population-level spatial alignment or assume data that is
temporally structured, either because data is aligned among subjects or because
event timings are known. We introduce a manifold learning framework that can
capture subject-specific spatial variations across both structured and
temporally unstructured neuroimaging data. On simulated data and two
naturalistic fMRI datasets (Sherlock and Forrest Gump), our framework
outperforms group-based baselines by recovering more accurate and
individualized representations. We further show that the framework scales
efficiently to large datasets and generalizes well to new subjects. To test
this, we apply the framework to temporally unstructured resting-state fMRI data
from individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls. We further apply our
method to a large resting-state fMRI dataset comprising individuals with
schizophrenia and controls. In this setting, we demonstrate that the framework
scales efficiently to large populations and generalizes robustly to unseen
subjects. The learned subject-specific spatial maps our model finds reveal
clinically relevant patterns, including increased activation in the basal
ganglia, visual, auditory, and somatosensory regions, and decreased activation
in the insula, inferior frontal gyrus, and angular gyrus. These findings
suggest that our framework can uncover clinically relevant subject-specific
brain activity patterns. Our approach thus provides a scalable and
individualized framework for modeling brain activity, with applications in
computational neuroscience and clinical research.

TL;DR: 综述探讨了生成式机器学习在动态制造系统中的应用，提出了功能分类并分析了其控制相关特性，同时指出了研究空白和未来方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态制造过程的复杂特性需要先进的监控和控制技术，生成式机器学习具有潜力但缺乏控制导向的视角。

Method: 提出了四种功能分类（预测型、直接策略、质量推断和知识集成），分析了生成式ML架构的控制相关特性。

Result: 展示了生成式ML在制造控制中的潜力，同时指出了生成与控制功能分离、物理理解不足等研究空白。

Conclusion: 建议未来研究开发结合生成式ML和控制技术的集成框架，以应对现代制造系统的动态复杂性。

Abstract: Dynamic manufacturing processes exhibit complex characteristics defined by
time-varying parameters, nonlinear behaviors, and uncertainties. These
characteristics require sophisticated in-situ monitoring techniques utilizing
multimodal sensor data and adaptive control systems that can respond to
real-time feedback while maintaining product quality. Recently, generative
machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling complex
distributions and generating synthetic data while handling these manufacturing
uncertainties. However, adopting these generative technologies in dynamic
manufacturing systems lacks a functional control-oriented perspective to
translate their probabilistic understanding into actionable process controls
while respecting constraints. This review presents a functional classification
of Prediction-Based, Direct Policy, Quality Inference, and Knowledge-Integrated
approaches, offering a perspective for understanding existing ML-enhanced
control systems and incorporating generative ML. The analysis of generative ML
architectures within this framework demonstrates control-relevant properties
and potential to extend current ML-enhanced approaches where conventional
methods prove insufficient. We show generative ML's potential for manufacturing
control through decision-making applications, process guidance, simulation, and
digital twins, while identifying critical research gaps: separation between
generation and control functions, insufficient physical understanding of
manufacturing phenomena, and challenges adapting models from other domains. To
address these challenges, we propose future research directions aimed at
developing integrated frameworks that combine generative ML and control
technologies to address the dynamic complexities of modern manufacturing
systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对黑盒生成AI和特征编码器的联邦学习算法，解决了在无法优化内部参数的情况下构建混合专家模型的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于行业标准的生成AI和特征编码器多为黑盒，用户无法优化其内部参数，限制了混合专家模型的效果。

Method: 采用非竞争博弈论视角，提出一种去中心化的联邦学习算法，各AI代理在本地优化结构，无需共享内部参数。

Result: 算法在真实和合成时间序列基准测试中取得了显著的预测精度提升。

Conclusion: 该算法为黑盒AI的协同优化提供了有效解决方案，填补了该领域的研究空白。

Abstract: Most industry-standard generative AIs and feature encoders are proprietary,
offering only black-box access: their outputs are observable, but their
internal parameters and architectures remain hidden from the end-user. This
black-box access is especially limiting when constructing mixture-of-expert
type ensemble models since the user cannot optimize each proprietary AI's
internal parameters. Our problem naturally lends itself to a non-competitive
game-theoretic lens where each proprietary AI (agent) is inherently competing
against the other AI agents, with this competition arising naturally due to
their obliviousness of the AI's to their internal structure. In contrast, the
user acts as a central planner trying to synchronize the ensemble of competing
AIs.
  We show the existence of the unique Nash equilibrium in the online setting,
which we even compute in closed-form by eliciting a feedback mechanism between
any given time series and the sequence generated by each (proprietary) AI
agent. Our solution is implemented as a decentralized, federated-learning
algorithm in which each agent optimizes their structure locally on their
machine without ever releasing any internal structure to the others. We obtain
refined expressions for pre-trained models such as transformers, random feature
models, and echo-state networks. Our ``proprietary federated learning''
algorithm is implemented on a range of real-world and synthetic time-series
benchmarks. It achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements in predictive accuracy
over natural benchmarks, of which there are surprisingly few due to this
natural problem still being largely unexplored.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于历史数据的纵向表格Transformer模型（LTT），用于提高电力恢复时间（ETR）预测的准确性，显著提升了客户满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化加剧导致电力恢复时间预测的准确性变得至关重要，但现有方法依赖人工或传统统计方法，精度不足。

Method: 采用LTT模型，结合历史停电事件数据和顺序更新，评估了34,000次风暴相关停电事件。

Result: LTT模型将客户满意度影响（CSI）指标平均提高了19.08%，并引入了客户导向的回归指标。

Conclusion: LTT模型不仅提高了预测准确性，还通过可解释性技术增强了透明度，提升了客户信任。

Abstract: As climate variability increases, the ability of utility providers to deliver
precise Estimated Times of Restoration (ETR) during natural disasters has
become increasingly critical. Accurate and timely ETRs are essential for
enabling customer preparedness during extended power outages, where informed
decision-making can be crucial, particularly in severe weather conditions.
Nonetheless, prevailing utility practices predominantly depend on manual
assessments or traditional statistical methods, which often fail to achieve the
level of precision required for reliable and actionable predictions. To address
these limitations, we propose a Longitudinal Tabular Transformer (LTT) model
that leverages historical outage event data along with sequential updates of
these events to improve the accuracy of ETR predictions. The model's
performance was evaluated over 34,000 storm-related outage events from three
major utility companies, collectively serving over 3 million customers over a
2-year period. Results demonstrate that the LTT model improves the Customer
Satisfaction Impact (CSI) metric by an average of 19.08% (p > 0.001) compared
to existing methods. Additionally, we introduce customer-informed regression
metrics that align model evaluation with real-world satisfaction, ensuring the
outcomes resonate with customer expectations. Furthermore, we employ
interpretability techniques to analyze the temporal significance of
incorporating sequential updates in modeling outage events and to identify the
contributions of predictive features to a given ETR. This comprehensive
approach not only improves predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency,
fostering greater trust in the model's capabilities.

Abstract: Driven by the advancements in generative AI, large machine learning models
have revolutionized domains such as image processing, audio synthesis, and
speech recognition. While server-based deployments remain the locus of peak
performance, the imperative for on-device inference, necessitated by privacy
and efficiency considerations, persists. Recognizing GPUs as the on-device ML
accelerator with the widest reach, we present ML Drift--an optimized framework
that extends the capabilities of state-of-the-art GPU-accelerated inference
engines. ML Drift enables on-device execution of generative AI workloads which
contain 10 to 100x more parameters than existing on-device generative AI
models. ML Drift addresses intricate engineering challenges associated with
cross-GPU API development, and ensures broad compatibility across mobile and
desktop/laptop platforms, thereby facilitating the deployment of significantly
more complex models on resource-constrained devices. Our GPU-accelerated ML/AI
inference engine achieves an order-of-magnitude performance improvement
relative to existing open-source GPU inference engines.

Motivation: 减少对任务特定知识工程的依赖，探索LLM代理如何通过自我生成的经验数据库自动改进性能。

Method: 构建并优化自我生成的成功轨迹数据库，引入数据库级和示例级选择策略。

Result: 在ALFWorld、Wordcraft和InterCode-SQL基准测试中性能显著提升，最高达91%。

Conclusion: 自动轨迹数据库构建是替代人工知识工程的有效方法。

Abstract: Many methods for improving Large Language Model (LLM) agents for sequential
decision-making tasks depend on task-specific knowledge engineering--such as
prompt tuning, curated in-context examples, or customized observation and
action spaces. Using these approaches, agent performance improves with the
quality or amount of knowledge engineering invested. Instead, we investigate
how LLM agents can automatically improve their performance by learning
in-context from their own successful experiences on similar tasks. Rather than
relying on task-specific knowledge engineering, we focus on constructing and
refining a database of self-generated examples. We demonstrate that even a
naive accumulation of successful trajectories across training tasks boosts test
performance on three benchmarks: ALFWorld (73% to 89%), Wordcraft (55% to 64%),
and InterCode-SQL (75% to 79%)--matching the performance the initial agent
achieves if allowed two to three attempts per task. We then introduce two
extensions: (1) database-level selection through population-based training to
identify high-performing example collections, and (2) exemplar-level selection
that retains individual trajectories based on their empirical utility as
in-context examples. These extensions further enhance performance, achieving
91% on ALFWorld--matching more complex approaches that employ task-specific
components and prompts. Our results demonstrate that automatic trajectory
database construction offers a compelling alternative to labor-intensive
knowledge engineering.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese medicine, as an essential component of traditional
medicine, contains active ingredients that serve as a crucial source for modern
drug development, holding immense therapeutic potential and development value.
A multi-layered and complex network is formed from Chinese medicine to diseases
and used to predict the potential associations between Chinese medicine
ingredients and diseases. This study proposes an ingredient-disease association
prediction model (Node2Vec-DGI-EL) based on hierarchical graph representation
learning. First, the model uses the Node2Vec algorithm to extract node
embedding vectors from the network as the initial features of the nodes. Next,
the network nodes are deeply represented and learned using the DGI algorithm to
enhance the model's expressive power. To improve prediction accuracy and
robustness, an ensemble learning method is incorporated to achieve more
accurate ingredient-disease association predictions. The effectiveness of the
model is then evaluated through a series of theoretical verifications. The
results demonstrated that the proposed model significantly outperformed
existing methods, achieving an AUC of 0.9987 and an AUPR of 0.9545, thereby
indicating superior predictive capability. Ablation experiments further
revealed the contribution and importance of each module. Additionally, case
studies explored potential associations, such as triptonide with hypertensive
retinopathy and methyl ursolate with colorectal cancer. Molecular docking
experiments validated these findings, showing the triptonide-PGR interaction
and the methyl ursolate-NFE2L2 interaction can bind stable. In conclusion, the
Node2Vec-DGI-EL model focuses on TCM datasets and effectively predicts
ingredient-disease associations, overcoming the reliance on node semantic
information.

Conclusion: HFGNN有效解决了金融数据共享中的隐私问题，提升了数据联合画像能力。

Abstract: The sharing of external data has become a strong demand of financial
institutions, but the privacy issue has led to the difficulty of
interconnecting different platforms and the low degree of data openness. To
effectively solve the privacy problem of financial data in trans-border flow
and sharing, to ensure that the data is available but not visible, to realize
the joint portrait of all kinds of heterogeneous data of business organizations
in different industries, we propose a Heterogeneous Federated Graph Neural
Network (HFGNN) approach. In this method, the distribution of heterogeneous
business data of trans-border organizations is taken as subgraphs, and the
sharing and circulation process among subgraphs is constructed as a
statistically heterogeneous global graph through a central server. Each
subgraph learns the corresponding personalized service model through local
training to select and update the relevant subset of subgraphs with aggregated
parameters, and effectively separates and combines topological and feature
information among subgraphs. Finally, our simulation experimental results show
that the proposed method has higher accuracy performance and faster convergence
speed than existing methods.

Conclusion: 该方法展示了解决WCM过度简化的潜力，提升了土壤湿度估算的准确性。

Abstract: Soil moisture (SM) estimation from active microwave data remains challenging
due to the complex interactions between radar backscatter and surface
characteristics. While the water cloud model (WCM) provides a semi-physical
approach for understanding these interactions, its empirical component often
limits performance across diverse agricultural landscapes. This research
presents preliminary efforts for developing a knowledge-guided deep learning
approach, which integrates WCM principles into a long short-term memory (LSTM)
model, to estimate field SM using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
data. Our proposed approach leverages LSTM's capacity to capture spatiotemporal
dependencies while maintaining physical consistency through a modified
dual-component loss function, including a WCM-based semi-physical component and
a boundary condition regularisation. The proposed approach is built upon the
soil backscatter coefficients isolated from the total backscatter, together
with Landsat-resolution vegetation information and surface characteristics. A
four-fold spatial cross-validation was performed against in-situ SM data to
assess the model performance. Results showed the proposed approach reduced SM
retrieval uncertainties by 0.02 m$^3$/m$^3$ and achieved correlation
coefficients (R) of up to 0.64 in areas with varying vegetation cover and
surface conditions, demonstrating the potential to address the
over-simplification in WCM.

Abstract: Accurately estimating human skill levels is crucial for designing effective
human-AI interactions so that AI can provide appropriate challenges or
guidance. In games where AI players have beaten top human professionals,
strength estimation plays a key role in adapting AI behavior to match human
skill levels. In a previous state-of-the-art study, researchers have proposed a
strength estimator trained using human players' match data. Given some matches,
the strength estimator computes strength scores and uses them to estimate
player ranks (skill levels). In this paper, we focus on the observation that
human players' behavior tendency varies according to their strength and aim to
improve the accuracy of strength estimation by taking this into account.
Specifically, in addition to strength scores, we obtain policies for different
skill levels from neural networks trained using human players' match data. We
then combine features based on these policies with the strength scores to
estimate strength. We conducted experiments on Go and chess. For Go, our method
achieved an accuracy of 80% in strength estimation when given 10 matches, which
increased to 92% when given 20 matches. In comparison, the previous
state-of-the-art method had an accuracy of 71% with 10 matches and 84% with 20
matches, demonstrating improvements of 8-9%. We observed similar improvements
in chess. These results contribute to developing a more accurate strength
estimation method and to improving human-AI interaction.

Conclusion: HMFNet在分子结构表示和AI驱动技术发展方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Molecular odor prediction is the process of using a molecule's structure to
predict its smell. While accurate prediction remains challenging, AI models can
suggest potential odors. Existing methods, however, often rely on basic
descriptors or handcrafted fingerprints, which lack expressive power and hinder
effective learning. Furthermore, these methods suffer from severe class
imbalance, limiting the training effectiveness of AI models. To address these
challenges, we propose a Feature Contribution-driven Hierarchical Multi-Feature
Mapping Network (HMFNet). Specifically, we introduce a fine-grained, Local
Multi-Hierarchy Feature Extraction module (LMFE) that performs deep feature
extraction at the atomic level, capturing detailed features crucial for odor
prediction. To enhance the extraction of discriminative atomic features, we
integrate a Harmonic Modulated Feature Mapping (HMFM). This module dynamically
learns feature importance and frequency modulation, improving the model's
capability to capture relevant patterns. Additionally, a Global Multi-Hierarchy
Feature Extraction module (GMFE) is designed to learn global features from the
molecular graph topology, enabling the model to fully leverage global
information and enhance its discriminative power for odor prediction. To
further mitigate the issue of class imbalance, we propose a Chemically-Informed
Loss (CIL). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves performance across various deep learning models, highlighting its
potential to advance molecular structure representation and accelerate the
development of AI-driven technologies.

Result: 循环GNNs可以达到Weisfeiler-Leman算法的表达极限，且通过随机初始化可以模拟所有图算法。

Conclusion: 循环GNNs在表达能力上优于非循环GNNs，且具有多项式时间和空间复杂度。

Abstract: We provide first tight bounds for the expressivity of Recurrent Graph Neural
Networks (recurrent GNNs) with finite-precision parameters. We prove that
recurrent GNNs, with sum aggregation and ReLU activation, can emulate any graph
algorithm that respects the natural message-passing invariance induced by the
color refinement (or Weisfeiler-Leman) algorithm. While it is well known that
the expressive power of GNNs is limited by this invariance [Morris et al., AAAI
2019; Xu et al., ICLR 2019], we establish that recurrent GNNs can actually
reach this limit. This is in contrast to non-recurrent GNNs, which have the
power of Weisfeiler-Leman only in a very weak, "non-uniform", sense where every
graph size requires a different GNN model to compute with. The emulation we
construct introduces only a polynomial overhead in both time and space.
  Furthermore, we show that by incorporating random initialization, recurrent
GNNs can emulate all graph algorithms, implying in particular that any graph
algorithm with polynomial-time complexity can be emulated by a recurrent GNN
with random initialization, running in polynomial time.

Conclusion: TAEGCN能有效捕捉时空依赖关系，提升预测准确性。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting enables the prediction of future states
by leveraging historical data, thereby facilitating decision-making processes.
Each data node in a multivariate time series encompasses a sequence of multiple
dimensions. These nodes exhibit interdependent relationships, forming a graph
structure. While existing prediction methods often assume a fixed graph
structure, many real-world scenarios involve dynamic graph structures.
Moreover, interactions among time series observed at different time scales vary
significantly. To enhance prediction accuracy by capturing precise temporal and
spatial features, this paper introduces the Temporal Attention Evolutional
Graph Convolutional Network (TAEGCN). This novel method not only integrates
causal temporal convolution and a multi-head self-attention mechanism to learn
temporal features of nodes, but also construct the dynamic graph structure
based on these temporal features to keep the consistency of the changing in
spatial feature with temporal series. TAEGCN adeptly captures temporal causal
relationships and hidden spatial dependencies within the data. Furthermore,

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的Transformer架构，用于建模多变量时间序列中的跨时间和跨变量依赖关系，通过独立嵌入和注意力机制优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多变量时间序列预测需要同时建模跨时间和跨变量的依赖关系，而现有Transformer架构在这两方面的整合和优化上存在挑战。

Method: 首先独立嵌入每个变量以捕捉其跨时间动态，然后通过注意力机制建模跨变量依赖关系，并使用门控操作调节信息流。

Result: 在13个真实数据集上实现了最先进的性能，性能提升最高达20.7%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效整合了跨时间和跨变量依赖关系，显著提升了预测性能，并可无缝集成到其他Transformer和LLM模型中。

Abstract: There has been a recent surge of interest in time series modeling using the
Transformer architecture. However, forecasting multivariate time series with
Transformer presents a unique challenge as it requires modeling both temporal
(cross-time) and variate (cross-variate) dependencies. While Transformer-based
models have gained popularity for their flexibility in capturing both
sequential and cross-variate relationships, it is unclear how to best integrate
these two sources of information in the context of the Transformer architecture
while optimizing for both performance and efficiency. We re-purpose the
Transformer architecture to effectively model both cross-time and cross-variate
dependencies. Our approach begins by embedding each variate independently into
a variate-wise representation that captures its cross-time dynamics, and then
models cross-variate dependencies through attention mechanisms on these learned
embeddings. Gating operations in both cross-time and cross-variate modeling
phases regulate information flow, allowing the model to focus on the most
relevant features for accurate predictions. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across 13 real-world datasets and can be
seamlessly integrated into other Transformer-based and LLM-based forecasters,
delivering performance improvements up to 20.7\% over original models. Code is
available at this repository: https://github.com/nyuolab/Gateformer.

TL;DR: MoSA提出了一种动态稀疏注意力机制，通过选择关键令牌降低计算复杂度，性能优于密集注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自注意力机制的高计算成本问题，提升稀疏注意力方法的实际性能。

Method: 基于Mixture of Experts的MoSA方法，动态选择令牌，实现任意稀疏注意力模式。

Result: MoSA在相同计算预算下性能优于密集基线，最高提升27%困惑度，并减少资源使用。

Conclusion: MoSA是一种高效的稀疏注意力方法，兼具性能和资源效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models highlighted the excessive quadratic
cost of self-attention. Despite the significant research efforts, subquadratic
attention methods still suffer from inferior performance in practice. We
hypothesize that dynamic, learned content-based sparsity can lead to more
efficient attention mechanisms. We present Mixture of Sparse Attention (MoSA),
a novel approach inspired by Mixture of Experts (MoE) with expert choice
routing. MoSA dynamically selects tokens for each attention head, allowing
arbitrary sparse attention patterns. By selecting $k$ tokens from a sequence of
length $T$, MoSA reduces the computational complexity of each attention head
from $O(T^2)$ to $O(k^2 + T)$. This enables using more heads within the same
computational budget, allowing higher specialization. We show that among the
tested sparse attention variants, MoSA is the only one that can outperform the
dense baseline, sometimes with up to 27% better perplexity for an identical
compute budget. MoSA can also reduce the resource usage compared to dense
self-attention. Despite using torch implementation without an optimized kernel,
perplexity-matched MoSA models are simultaneously faster in wall-clock time,
require less memory for training, and drastically reduce the size of the
KV-cache compared to the dense transformer baselines.

Motivation: CPM计算成本高，限制了其在复杂生物系统模拟中的应用。

Result: 替代模型加速了590倍，成功捕捉了血管生成等复杂行为。

Conclusion: 深度学习可作为高效替代模型，扩展CPM在更大时空尺度上的应用。

Abstract: The Cellular-Potts model is a powerful and ubiquitous framework for
developing computational models for simulating complex multicellular biological
systems. Cellular-Potts models (CPMs) are often computationally expensive due
to the explicit modeling of interactions among large numbers of individual
model agents and diffusive fields described by partial differential equations
(PDEs). In this work, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) surrogate
model using a U-Net architecture that accounts for periodic boundary
conditions. We use this model to accelerate the evaluation of a mechanistic CPM
previously used to investigate \textit{in vitro} vasculogenesis. The surrogate
model was trained to predict 100 computational steps ahead (Monte-Carlo steps,
MCS), accelerating simulation evaluations by a factor of 590 times compared to
CPM code execution. Over multiple recursive evaluations, our model effectively
captures the emergent behaviors demonstrated by the original Cellular-Potts
model of such as vessel sprouting, extension and anastomosis, and contraction
of vascular lacunae. This approach demonstrates the potential for deep learning
to serve as efficient surrogate models for CPM simulations, enabling faster
evaluation of computationally expensive CPM of biological processes at greater
spatial and temporal scales.

TL;DR: SteinSense是一种轻量级迭代算法，用于高维向量恢复，无需调参或训练数据，且易于实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统凸优化方法在高维向量恢复中表现不佳，需要更优的解决方案。

Method: 提出SteinSense算法，基于近似消息传递理论，无调参需求且易于扩展。

Result: 实验证明SteinSense在高维向量恢复中表现优异且稳健。

Conclusion: SteinSense是一种高效、简单且可扩展的高维向量恢复方法。

Abstract: The trend in modern science and technology is to take vector measurements
rather than scalars, ruthlessly scaling to ever higher dimensional vectors. For
about two decades now, traditional scalar Compressed Sensing has been
synonymous with a Convex Optimization based procedure called Basis Pursuit. In
the vector recovery case, the natural tendency is to return to a
straightforward vector extension of Basis Pursuit, also based on Convex
Optimization. However, Convex Optimization is provably suboptimal, particularly
when $B$ is large. In this paper, we propose SteinSense, a lightweight
iterative algorithm, which is provably optimal when $B$ is large. It does not
have any tuning parameter, does not need any training data, requires zero
knowledge of sparsity, is embarrassingly simple to implement, and all of this
makes it easily scalable to high vector dimensions. We conduct a massive volume
of both real and synthetic experiments that confirm the efficacy of SteinSense,
and also provide theoretical justification based on ideas from Approximate
Message Passing. Fascinatingly, we discover that SteinSense is quite robust,
delivering the same quality of performance on real data, and even under
substantial departures from conditions under which existing theory holds.

Motivation: 解决大规模语言模型在联邦学习中因资源限制和通信开销导致的微调难题。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持精度的同时显著减少通信开销。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模模型在无线联邦学习中的高效部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
success across various tasks. Yet, fine-tuning such massive models in federated
learning (FL) settings poses significant challenges due to resource constraints
and communication overhead. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) addresses these issues
by training compact, low-rank matrices instead of fully fine-tuning large
models. This paper introduces a wireless federated LoRA fine-tuning framework
that optimizes both learning performance and communication efficiency. We
provide a novel convergence analysis, revealing how LoRA rank and covariance
effects influence FL training dynamics. Leveraging these insights, we propose
Sparsified Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (\textbf{SOFT}), an adaptive sparsification
method that streamlines parameter updates without expensive matrix
multiplications and singular value decomposition (SVD) operations.
Additionally, we present a Two Stage Federated Algorithm (\textbf{TSFA})
algorithm that pre-determines key parameters offline and dynamically adjusts
bandwidth and sparsification online, ensuring efficient training under latency
constraints. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach achieves
accuracy comparable to ideal scenario models while significantly reducing
communication overhead. Our framework thus enables scalable, resource-efficient
deployment of large models in real-world wireless FL scenarios.

TL;DR: T2VPhysBench是一个基于物理第一性原理的基准测试，用于评估文本到视频生成模型是否遵守核心物理定律，结果显示当前模型普遍表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管文本到视频生成模型在美学和指令遵循上表现优异，但其对基本物理定律的遵守能力尚未得到充分测试，导致生成内容可能违反物理规则。

Method: 通过T2VPhysBench，结合人类评估和第一性物理原理，系统评估了开源和商业模型对12项核心物理定律的遵守情况。

Result: 所有模型在各项物理定律上的平均得分低于0.60，即使提供详细提示也无法改善物理违规问题。

Conclusion: 当前模型在物理规则遵守上存在显著不足，未来研究需更注重物理感知的视频生成。

Abstract: Text-to-video generative models have made significant strides in recent
years, producing high-quality videos that excel in both aesthetic appeal and
accurate instruction following, and have become central to digital art creation
and user engagement online. Yet, despite these advancements, their ability to
respect fundamental physical laws remains largely untested: many outputs still
violate basic constraints such as rigid-body collisions, energy conservation,
and gravitational dynamics, resulting in unrealistic or even misleading
content. Existing physical-evaluation benchmarks typically rely on automatic,
pixel-level metrics applied to simplistic, life-scenario prompts, and thus
overlook both human judgment and first-principles physics. To fill this gap, we
introduce \textbf{T2VPhysBench}, a first-principled benchmark that
systematically evaluates whether state-of-the-art text-to-video systems, both
open-source and commercial, obey twelve core physical laws including Newtonian
mechanics, conservation principles, and phenomenological effects. Our benchmark
employs a rigorous human evaluation protocol and includes three targeted
studies: (1) an overall compliance assessment showing that all models score
below 0.60 on average in each law category; (2) a prompt-hint ablation
revealing that even detailed, law-specific hints fail to remedy physics
violations; and (3) a counterfactual robustness test demonstrating that models
often generate videos that explicitly break physical rules when so instructed.
The results expose persistent limitations in current architectures and offer
concrete insights for guiding future research toward truly physics-aware video
generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型轻量级优化器SOLO，通过超低精度量化（低至2-3比特）显著减少内存占用（如训练7B模型节省约45GB），同时解决无符号量化和有符号量化中的关键问题。


<details>

Motivation: 模型规模爆炸式增长导致训练/微调成本过高，尤其是需要维护大量辅助信息的优化器。

Method: 采用超低精度量化（2-3比特），针对无符号量化的信号淹没问题和有符号量化的梯度方差问题，提出对数量化和特定动量值。

Result: SOLO显著节省内存（如7B模型节省45GB），且精度损失极小。

Conclusion: SOLO有望突破计算资源瓶颈，提升基础研究的可及性。

Abstract: The explosion in model sizes leads to continued growth in prohibitive
training/fine-tuning costs, particularly for stateful optimizers which maintain
auxiliary information of even 2x the model size to achieve optimal convergence.
We therefore present in this work a novel type of optimizer that carries with
extremely lightweight state overloads, achieved through ultra-low-precision
quantization. While previous efforts have achieved certain success with 8-bit
or 4-bit quantization, our approach enables optimizers to operate at precision
as low as 3 bits, or even 2 bits per state element. This is accomplished by
identifying and addressing two critical challenges: the signal swamping problem
in unsigned quantization that results in unchanged state dynamics, and the
rapidly increased gradient variance in signed quantization that leads to
incorrect descent directions. The theoretical analysis suggests a tailored
logarithmic quantization for the former and a precision-specific momentum value
for the latter. Consequently, the proposed SOLO achieves substantial memory
savings (approximately 45 GB when training a 7B model) with minimal accuracy
loss. We hope that SOLO can contribute to overcoming the bottleneck in
computational resources, thereby promoting greater accessibility in fundamental
research.

Abstract: Accurate household electrical energy demand prediction is essential for
effectively managing sustainable Energy Communities. Integrated with the Energy
Management System, these communities aim to optimise operational costs.
However, most existing forecasting models are region-specific and depend on
large datasets, limiting their applicability across different climates and
geographical areas. These models often lack flexibility and may not perform
well in regions with limited historical data, leading to inaccurate
predictions. This paper proposes a global model for 24-hour-ahead hourly
electrical energy demand prediction that is designed to perform effectively
across diverse climate conditions and datasets. The model's efficiency is
demonstrated using data from two distinct regions: Ireland, with a maritime
climate and Vietnam, with a tropical climate. Remarkably, the model achieves
high accuracy even with a limited dataset spanning only nine months. Its
robustness is further validated across different seasons in Ireland (summer and
winter) and Vietnam (dry and wet). The proposed model is evaluated against
state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning methods. Simulation results
indicate that the model consistently outperforms benchmark models, showcasing
its capability to provide reliable forecasts globally, regardless of varying
climatic conditions and data availability. This research underscores the
model's potential to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of Energy
Communities worldwide. The proposed model achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage
Error of 8.0% and 4.0% on the full Irish and Vietnamese datasets.

Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices
necessitates effective model com- pression strategies that judiciously balance
the reduction of model size with the preservation of performance. This study
introduces a novel safety-driven quantization framework that leverages
preservation sets to systematically prune and quantize neural network weights,
thereby optimizing model complexity without compromising accuracy. The proposed
methodology is rigorously evaluated on both a convolutional neural network
(CNN) and an attention-based language model, demonstrating its applicability
across diverse architectural paradigms. Experimental results reveal that our
framework achieves up to a 2.5% enhancement in test accuracy relative to the
original unquantized models while maintaining 60% of the initial model size. In
comparison to conventional quantization techniques, our approach not only
augments generalization by eliminating parameter noise and retaining essential
weights but also reduces variance, thereby ensuring the retention of critical
model features. These findings underscore the efficacy of safety-driven
quantization as a robust and reliable strategy for the efficient optimization
of deep learn- ing models. The implementation and comprehensive experimental
evaluations of our framework are publicly accessible at GitHub.

Result: R&B在五种数据集上表现优异，仅需0.01%额外计算开销即可匹配或超越现有方法。

Conclusion: R&B是一种高效且性能优越的数据混合策略，无需额外计算即可优化模型训练。

Abstract: Data mixing strategies have successfully reduced the costs involved in
training language models. While promising, such methods suffer from two flaws.
First, they rely on predetermined data domains (e.g., data sources, task
types), which may fail to capture critical semantic nuances, leaving
performance on the table. Second, these methods scale with the number of
domains in a computationally prohibitive way. We address these challenges via
R&B, a framework that re-partitions training data based on semantic similarity
(Regroup) to create finer-grained domains, and efficiently optimizes the data
composition (Balance) by leveraging a Gram matrix induced by domain gradients
obtained throughout training. Unlike prior works, it removes the need for
additional compute to obtain evaluation information such as losses or
gradients. We analyze this technique under standard regularity conditions and
provide theoretical insights that justify R&B's effectiveness compared to
non-adaptive mixing approaches. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness
of R&B on five diverse datasets ranging from natural language to reasoning and
multimodal tasks. With as little as 0.01% additional compute overhead, R&B
matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art data mixing strategies.

Abstract: In data stream clustering, systematic theory of stream clustering algorithms
remains relatively scarce. Recently, density-based methods have gained
attention. However, existing algorithms struggle to simultaneously handle
arbitrarily shaped, multi-density, high-dimensional data while maintaining
strong outlier resistance. Clustering quality significantly deteriorates when
data density varies complexly. This paper proposes a clustering algorithm based
on the novel concept of Tightest Neighbors and introduces a data stream
clustering theory based on the Skeleton Set. Based on these theories, this
paper develops a new method, TNStream, a fully online algorithm. The algorithm
adaptively determines the clustering radius based on local similarity,
summarizing the evolution of multi-density data streams in micro-clusters. It
then applies a Tightest Neighbors-based clustering algorithm to form final
clusters. To improve efficiency in high-dimensional cases, Locality-Sensitive
Hashing (LSH) is employed to structure micro-clusters, addressing the challenge
of storing k-nearest neighbors. TNStream is evaluated on various synthetic and
real-world datasets using different clustering metrics. Experimental results
demonstrate its effectiveness in improving clustering quality for multi-density
data and validate the proposed data stream clustering theory.

Abstract: Interpretable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) aim to reveal the underlying
reasoning behind model predictions, attributing their decisions to specific
subgraphs that are informative. However, existing subgraph-based interpretable
methods suffer from an overemphasis on local structure, potentially overlooking
long-range dependencies within the entire graphs. Although recent efforts that
rely on graph coarsening have proven beneficial for global interpretability,
they inevitably reduce the graphs to a fixed granularity. Such an inflexible
way can only capture graph connectivity at a specific level, whereas real-world
graph tasks often exhibit relationships at varying granularities (e.g.,
relevant interactions in proteins span from functional groups, to amino acids,
and up to protein domains). In this paper, we introduce a novel Tree-like
Interpretable Framework (TIF) for graph classification, where plain GNNs are
transformed into hierarchical trees, with each level featuring coarsened graphs
of different granularity as tree nodes. Specifically, TIF iteratively adopts a
graph coarsening module to compress original graphs (i.e., root nodes of trees)
into increasingly coarser ones (i.e., child nodes of trees), while preserving
diversity among tree nodes within different branches through a dedicated graph
perturbation module. Finally, we propose an adaptive routing module to identify
the most informative root-to-leaf paths, providing not only the final
prediction but also the multi-granular interpretability for the decision-making
process. Extensive experiments on the graph classification benchmarks with both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of TIF in
interpretability, while also delivering a competitive prediction performance
akin to the state-of-the-art counterparts.

Conclusion: SacFL通过轻量化和自主检测机制，为终端设备提供了一种高效且实用的联邦持续学习解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of end devices has led to a distributed computing paradigm,
wherein on-device machine learning models continuously process diverse data
generated by these devices. The dynamic nature of this data, characterized by
continuous changes or data drift, poses significant challenges for on-device
models. To address this issue, continual learning (CL) is proposed, enabling
machine learning models to incrementally update their knowledge and mitigate
catastrophic forgetting. However, the traditional centralized approach to CL is
unsuitable for end devices due to privacy and data volume concerns. In this
context, federated continual learning (FCL) emerges as a promising solution,
preserving user data locally while enhancing models through collaborative
updates. Aiming at the challenges of limited storage resources for CL, poor
autonomy in task shift detection, and difficulty in coping with new adversarial
tasks in FCL scenario, we propose a novel FCL framework named SacFL. SacFL
employs an Encoder-Decoder architecture to separate task-robust and
task-sensitive components, significantly reducing storage demands by retaining
lightweight task-sensitive components for resource-constrained end devices.
Moreover, $\rm{SacFL}$ leverages contrastive learning to introduce an
autonomous data shift detection mechanism, enabling it to discern whether a new
task has emerged and whether it is a benign task. This capability ultimately
allows the device to autonomously trigger CL or attack defense strategy without
additional information, which is more practical for end devices. Comprehensive
experiments conducted on multiple text and image datasets, such as Cifar100 and
THUCNews, have validated the effectiveness of $\rm{SacFL}$ in both
class-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios. Furthermore, a demo system
has been developed to verify its practicality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计包裹送达时间对物流行业至关重要，尤其是在混合物流场景中，取件和送件对快递员决策行为的影响不同。现有研究往往忽视取件对快递员决策的更大影响。

Method: 提出TransPDT模型，利用Transformer编码器捕捉快递员历史路线和待处理包裹的时空依赖，设计模式记忆模块通过注意力机制学习取件模式，并将路线预测作为辅助任务。

Result: 在真实工业规模数据集上的实验证明了方法的优越性，TransPDT已在京东物流内部部署，用于追踪北京地区2000多名快递员的每日数十万包裹处理。

Conclusion: TransPDT通过多任务学习和时空依赖建模，有效解决了混合物流场景中的送达时间预测问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Accurately estimating package delivery time is essential to the logistics
industry, which enables reasonable work allocation and on-time service
guarantee. This becomes even more necessary in mixed logistics scenarios where
couriers handle a high volume of delivery and a smaller number of pickup
simultaneously. However, most of the related works treat the pickup and
delivery patterns on couriers' decision behavior equally, neglecting that the
pickup has a greater impact on couriers' decision-making compared to the
delivery due to its tighter time constraints. In such context, we have three
main challenges: 1) multiple spatiotemporal factors are intricately
interconnected, significantly affecting couriers' delivery behavior; 2) pickups
have stricter time requirements but are limited in number, making it
challenging to model their effects on couriers' delivery process; 3) couriers'
spatial mobility patterns are critical determinants of their delivery behavior,
but have been insufficiently explored. To deal with these, we propose TransPDT,
a Transformer-based multi-task package delivery time prediction model. We first
employ the Transformer encoder architecture to capture the spatio-temporal
dependencies of couriers' historical travel routes and pending package sets.
Then we design the pattern memory to learn the patterns of pickup in the
imbalanced dataset via attention mechanism. We also set the route prediction as
an auxiliary task of delivery time prediction, and incorporate the prior
courier spatial movement regularities in prediction. Extensive experiments on
real industry-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. A

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过构建基于DQN的随机微分延迟方程（SDDE），估计其与DQN的Wasserstein-1距离，并证明随着步长趋近于零，距离收敛于零。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DQN在强化学习中取得重大突破，但其理论分析仍有限，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 构建SDDE模型，利用改进的Lindeberg原理和算子比较方法，分析DQN与SDDE的距离。

Result: 给出了距离的上界，并证明距离随步长趋近于零而收敛于零，揭示了DQN中经验回放和目标网络的作用。

Conclusion: 从连续系统视角理解DQN技术，延迟项（对应目标网络）有助于系统稳定性。

Abstract: Despite the significant breakthroughs that the Deep Q-Network (DQN) has
brought to reinforcement learning, its theoretical analysis remains limited. In
this paper, we construct a stochastic differential delay equation (SDDE) based
on the DQN algorithm and estimate the Wasserstein-1 distance between them. We
provide an upper bound for the distance and prove that the distance between the
two converges to zero as the step size approaches zero. This result allows us
to understand DQN's two key techniques, the experience replay and the target
network, from the perspective of continuous systems. Specifically, the delay
term in the equation, corresponding to the target network, contributes to the
stability of the system. Our approach leverages a refined Lindeberg principle
and an operator comparison to establish these results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在动态约束变化的在线凸优化（OCO）中实现零约束违反的理论保证方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有约束OCO方法允许偶尔的安全违规，而本文旨在在约束逐渐演变的假设下保持严格安全性。

Method: 通过原始对偶方法和双空间中的在线梯度上升，采用二分学习率确保安全性和次线性遗憾。

Result: 证明了在约束变化下保持绝对安全性的首个可证明保证。

Conclusion: 本文框架为动态约束OCO中的严格安全性提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: We present the first theoretical guarantees for zero constraint violation in
Online Convex Optimization (OCO) across all rounds, addressing dynamic
constraint changes. Unlike existing approaches in constrained OCO, which allow
for occasional safety breaches, we provide the first approach for maintaining
strict safety under the assumption of gradually evolving constraints, namely
the constraints change at most by a small amount between consecutive rounds.
This is achieved through a primal-dual approach and Online Gradient Ascent in
the dual space. We show that employing a dichotomous learning rate enables
ensuring both safety, via zero constraint violation, and sublinear regret. Our
framework marks a departure from previous work by providing the first provable
guarantees for maintaining absolute safety in the face of changing constraints
in OCO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出DeepSTA模型，通过异常时空学习模块和异常模式注意力模块，提升物流场景中快递员准时率的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物流行业需提前预测快递员准时率以应对异常情况（如疫情），现有研究对此关注不足且未明确建模异常事件。

Method: 设计异常时空学习模块（RNN建模事件信息）和异常模式注意力模块（记忆网络存储异常特征），结合Node2vec、GNN和LSTM捕捉时空依赖。

Result: 在2022年COVID-19疫情数据集上，模型MAE和MSE分别优于基线12.11%和13.71%。

Conclusion: DeepSTA在异常物流场景中表现优异，解决了数据不足和信息损失问题。

Abstract: Prediction of couriers' delivery timely rates in advance is essential to the
logistics industry, enabling companies to take preemptive measures to ensure
the normal operation of delivery services. This becomes even more critical
during anomaly conditions like the epidemic outbreak, during which couriers'
delivery timely rate will decline markedly and fluctuates significantly.
Existing studies pay less attention to the logistics scenario. Moreover, many
works focusing on prediction tasks in anomaly scenarios fail to explicitly
model abnormal events, e.g., treating external factors equally with other
features, resulting in great information loss. Further, since some anomalous
events occur infrequently, traditional data-driven methods perform poorly in
these scenarios. To deal with them, we propose a deep spatial-temporal
attention model, named DeepSTA. To be specific, to avoid information loss, we
design an anomaly spatio-temporal learning module that employs a recurrent
neural network to model incident information. Additionally, we utilize Node2vec
to model correlations between road districts, and adopt graph neural networks
and long short-term memory to capture the spatial-temporal dependencies of
couriers. To tackle the issue of insufficient training data in abnormal
circumstances, we propose an anomaly pattern attention module that adopts a
memory network for couriers' anomaly feature patterns storage via attention
mechanisms. The experiments on real-world logistics datasets during the
COVID-19 outbreak in 2022 show the model outperforms the best baselines by
12.11% in MAE and 13.71% in MSE, demonstrating its superior performance over
multiple competitive baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 骨质疏松因其无症状特性常被忽视，早期预测对预防骨折至关重要。

Method: 评估六种机器学习分类器，使用临床、人口统计和生活方式数据，优化超参数，并应用SHAP、LIME等XAI方法解释模型。

Result: XGBoost准确率最高（91%），年龄是主要风险因素，结果与临床知识一致。

Abstract: The present research tackles the difficulty of predicting osteoporosis risk
via machine learning (ML) approaches, emphasizing the use of explainable
artificial intelligence (XAI) to improve model transparency. Osteoporosis is a
significant public health concern, sometimes remaining untreated owing to its
asymptomatic characteristics, and early identification is essential to avert
fractures. The research assesses six machine learning classifiers: Random
Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, AdaBoost, LightGBM, and Gradient Boosting
and utilizes a dataset based on clinical, demographic, and lifestyle variables.
The models are refined using GridSearchCV to calibrate hyperparameters, with
the objective of enhancing predictive efficacy. XGBoost had the greatest
accuracy (91%) among the evaluated models, surpassing others in precision
(0.92), recall (0.91), and F1-score (0.90). The research further integrates XAI
approaches, such as SHAP, LIME, and Permutation Feature Importance, to
elucidate the decision-making process of the optimal model. The study indicates
that age is the primary determinant in forecasting osteoporosis risk, followed
by hormonal alterations and familial history. These results corroborate
clinical knowledge and affirm the models' therapeutic significance. The
research underscores the significance of explainability in machine learning
models for healthcare applications, guaranteeing that physicians can rely on
the system's predictions. The report ultimately proposes directions for further
research, such as validation across varied populations and the integration of
supplementary biomarkers for enhanced predictive accuracy.

Motivation: 现有时间序列异常检测方法因数据分布偏移和非平稳性难以泛化到多源域和新目标域，亟需一种更灵活且可解释的解决方案。

Method: CICADA采用混合专家框架捕获域无关异常特征，结合选择性元学习防止负迁移，自适应扩展算法处理新域，分层注意力结构增强可解释性。

Result: 在合成和真实工业数据集上，CICADA在跨域检测性能和可解释性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CICADA为跨域时间序列异常检测提供了高效且可解释的解决方案，填补了研究空白。

Abstract: Unsupervised Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in
applications across industries. However, existing methods face significant
challenges due to data distributional shifts across different domains, which
are exacerbated by the non-stationarity of time series over time. Existing
models fail to generalize under multiple heterogeneous source domains and
emerging unseen new target domains. To fill the research gap, we introduce
CICADA (Cross-domain Interpretable Coding for Anomaly Detection and
Adaptation), with four key innovations: (1) a mixture of experts (MOE)
framework that captures domain-agnostic anomaly features with high flexibility
and interpretability; (2) a novel selective meta-learning mechanism to prevent
negative transfer between dissimilar domains, (3) an adaptive expansion
algorithm for emerging heterogeneous domain expansion, and (4) a hierarchical
attention structure that quantifies expert contributions during fusion to
enhance interpretability further.Extensive experiments on synthetic and
real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that CICADA outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain detection performance and
interpretability.

Motivation: 医疗设备风险分类对监管和临床安全至关重要，但现有方法在有限监督下泛化能力不足。

Method: 采用Transformer框架，结合交叉注意力机制捕捉模态间依赖，并引入自训练策略优化泛化能力。

Result: 在真实数据集上达到90.4%准确率和97.9% AUROC，显著优于单模态基线，自训练机制提升SVM性能3.3个百分点。

Conclusion: 交叉注意力和自训练策略互补，有效提升有限监督下的分类性能。

Abstract: Accurate classification of medical device risk levels is essential for
regulatory oversight and clinical safety. We present a Transformer-based
multimodal framework that integrates textual descriptions and visual
information to predict device regulatory classification. The model incorporates
a cross-attention mechanism to capture intermodal dependencies and employs a
self-training strategy for improved generalization under limited supervision.
Experiments on a real-world regulatory dataset demonstrate that our approach
achieves up to 90.4% accuracy and 97.9% AUROC, significantly outperforming
text-only (77.2%) and image-only (54.8%) baselines. Compared to standard
multimodal fusion, the self-training mechanism improved SVM performance by 3.3
percentage points in accuracy (from 87.1% to 90.4%) and 1.4 points in macro-F1,
suggesting that pseudo-labeling can effectively enhance generalization under
limited supervision. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary
benefits of both cross-modal attention and self-training.

Conclusion: 动态验证集是提升策略扩展性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that successful per-domain generalizing action policies
can be learned. Scaling behavior, from small training instances to large test
instances, is the key objective; and the use of validation instances larger
than training instances is one key to achieve it. Prior work has used fixed
validation sets. Here, we introduce a method generating the validation set
dynamically, on the fly, increasing instance size so long as informative and
feasible.We also introduce refined methodology for evaluating scaling behavior,
generating test instances systematically to guarantee a given confidence in
coverage performance for each instance size. In experiments, dynamic validation
improves scaling behavior of GNN policies in all 9 domains used.

Conclusion: 提出的框架为属性驱动的机器学习提供了通用解决方案，并已在实践中证明有效。

Abstract: Neural networks have been shown to frequently fail to satisfy critical safety
and correctness properties after training, highlighting the pressing need for
training methods that incorporate such properties directly. While adversarial
training can be used to improve robustness to small perturbations within
$\epsilon$-cubes, domains other than computer vision -- such as control systems
and natural language processing -- may require more flexible input region
specifications via generalised hyper-rectangles. Meanwhile, differentiable
logics offer a way to encode arbitrary logical constraints as additional loss
terms that guide the learning process towards satisfying these constraints. In
this paper, we investigate how these two complementary approaches can be
unified within a single framework for property-driven machine learning. We show
that well-known properties from the literature are subcases of this general
approach, and we demonstrate its practical effectiveness on a case study
involving a neural network controller for a drone system. Our framework is
publicly available at https://github.com/tflinkow/property-driven-ml.

Result: 多输出变压器模型能够准确预测非线性系统的多输出序列，且不受参数空间维度限制。

Conclusion: 多输出变压器模型在预测复杂动力系统输出方面表现出色，同时提供了对输出域空间相关性的解释。

Abstract: We explore the promising performance of a transformer model in predicting
outputs of parametric dynamical systems with external time-varying input
signals. The outputs of such systems vary not only with physical parameters but
also with external time-varying input signals. Accurately catching the dynamics
of such systems is challenging. We have adapted and extended an existing
transformer model for single output prediction to a multiple-output transformer
that is able to predict multiple output responses of these systems. The
multiple-output transformer generalizes the interpretability of the original
transformer. The generalized interpretable attention weight matrix explores not
only the temporal correlations in the sequence, but also the interactions
between the multiple outputs, providing explanation for the spatial correlation
in the output domain. This multiple-output transformer accurately predicts the
sequence of multiple outputs, regardless of the nonlinearity of the system and
the dimensionality of the parameter space.

Conclusion: DASP通过关注数据密度，有效解决了状态分布偏移问题，提升了离线强化学习的性能。

Abstract: The performance of Offline reinforcement learning is significantly impacted
by the issue of state distributional shift, and out-of-distribution (OOD) state
correction is a popular approach to address this problem. In this paper, we
propose a novel method named Density-Aware Safety Perception (DASP) for OOD
state correction. Specifically, our method encourages the agent to prioritize
actions that lead to outcomes with higher data density, thereby promoting its
operation within or the return to in-distribution (safe) regions. To achieve
this, we optimize the objective within a variational framework that
concurrently considers both the potential outcomes of decision-making and their
density, thus providing crucial contextual information for safe
decision-making. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and feasibility of our
proposed method through extensive experimental evaluations on the offline
MuJoCo and AntMaze suites.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种递归KL散度优化（RKDO）方法，将表示学习目标重新定义为局部条件分布上的递归对齐过程，相比静态方法，RKDO在损失值和计算资源上均显著更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如I-Con）通过固定邻域条件的KL散度统一学习范式，但忽略了学习过程中的递归结构。

Method: 引入RKDO，将表示学习建模为KL散度在数据邻域上的动态演化，涵盖对比学习、聚类和降维方法。

Result: 实验显示，RKDO在三个数据集上损失值降低约30%，计算资源减少60%-80%。

Conclusion: RKDO的递归更新机制为表示学习提供了更高效的优化路径，尤其适合资源受限场景。

Abstract: We propose a generalization of modern representation learning objectives by
reframing them as recursive divergence alignment processes over localized
conditional distributions While recent frameworks like Information Contrastive
Learning I-Con unify multiple learning paradigms through KL divergence between
fixed neighborhood conditionals we argue this view underplays a crucial
recursive structure inherent in the learning process. We introduce Recursive KL
Divergence Optimization RKDO a dynamic formalism where representation learning
is framed as the evolution of KL divergences across data neighborhoods. This
formulation captures contrastive clustering and dimensionality reduction
methods as static slices while offering a new path to model stability and local
adaptation. Our experiments demonstrate that RKDO offers dual efficiency
advantages approximately 30 percent lower loss values compared to static
approaches across three different datasets and 60 to 80 percent reduction in
computational resources needed to achieve comparable results. This suggests
that RKDOs recursive updating mechanism provides a fundamentally more efficient
optimization landscape for representation learning with significant
implications for resource constrained applications.

Result: 自消融导致更局部化的电路、集中的特征表示和神经元专业化，同时不损害语言建模性能。

Conclusion: 稀疏性与可解释性之间存在复杂关系，自消融通过促进局部专业化而非全局稀疏性提升可解释性。

Abstract: A growing intuition in machine learning suggests a link between sparsity and
interpretability. We introduce a novel self-ablation mechanism to investigate
this connection ante-hoc in the context of language transformers. Our approach
dynamically enforces a k-winner-takes-all constraint, forcing the model to
demonstrate selective activation across neuron and attention units. Unlike
post-hoc methods that analyze already-trained models, our approach integrates
interpretability directly into model training, promoting feature localization
from inception. Training small models on the TinyStories dataset and employing
interpretability tests, we find that self-ablation leads to more localized
circuits, concentrated feature representations, and increased neuron
specialization without compromising language modelling performance.
Surprisingly, our method also decreased overall sparsity, indicating that
self-ablation promotes specialization rather than widespread inactivity. This
reveals a complex interplay between sparsity and interpretability, where
decreased global sparsity can coexist with increased local specialization,
leading to enhanced interpretability. To facilitate reproducibility, we make
our code available at

Motivation: 现有基于SMILES的分子生成方法在强化学习阶段易出现灾难性遗忘，导致分子有效性显著下降。当前方法缺乏鲁棒的探索机制。

Method: 提出PSV-PPO算法，在每一步自回归生成时进行部分SMILES验证，评估当前候选标记及所有潜在分支，提前检测无效结构。

Result: 在PMO和GuacaMol数据集上，PSV-PPO显著减少无效生成结构，同时保持探索和优化性能。

Conclusion: PSV-PPO框架可扩展以融入更多领域知识，进一步推动药物发现中的强化学习应用。

Abstract: SMILES-based molecule generation has emerged as a powerful approach in drug
discovery. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) using large language model (LLM)
has been incorporated into the molecule generation process to achieve high
matching score in term of likelihood of desired molecule candidates. However, a
critical challenge in this approach is catastrophic forgetting during the RL
phase, where knowledge such as molecule validity, which often exceeds 99\%
during pretraining, significantly deteriorates. Current RL algorithms applied
in drug discovery, such as REINVENT, use prior models as anchors to retian
pretraining knowledge, but these methods lack robust exploration mechanisms. To
address these issues, we propose Partial SMILES Validation-PPO (PSV-PPO), a
novel RL algorithm that incorporates real-time partial SMILES validation to
prevent catastrophic forgetting while encouraging exploration. Unlike
traditional RL approaches that validate molecule structures only after
generating entire sequences, PSV-PPO performs stepwise validation at each
auto-regressive step, evaluating not only the selected token candidate but also
all potential branches stemming from the prior partial sequence. This enables
early detection of invalid partial SMILES across all potential paths. As a
result, PSV-PPO maintains high validity rates even during aggressive
exploration of the vast chemical space. Our experiments on the PMO and GuacaMol
benchmark datasets demonstrate that PSV-PPO significantly reduces the number of
invalid generated structures while maintaining competitive exploration and
optimization performance. While our work primarily focuses on maintaining
validity, the framework of PSV-PPO can be extended in future research to
incorporate additional forms of valuable domain knowledge, further enhancing
reinforcement learning applications in drug discovery.

Result: 在多个任务和数据集上显著优于基线方法，OfficeHome数据集上准确率提升5.88%，计算资源消耗极低。

Conclusion: TCA方法通过相关性对齐和高效实现，为测试时适应提供了简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often experience performance drops due to distribution
shifts between training and test data. Although domain adaptation offers a
solution, privacy concerns restrict access to training data in many real-world
scenarios. This restriction has spurred interest in Test-Time Adaptation (TTA),
which adapts models using only unlabeled test data. However, current TTA
methods still face practical challenges: (1) a primary focus on instance-wise
alignment, overlooking CORrelation ALignment (CORAL) due to missing source
correlations; (2) complex backpropagation operations for model updating,
resulting in overhead computation and (3) domain forgetting.
  To address these challenges, we provide a theoretical analysis to investigate
the feasibility of Test-time Correlation Alignment (TCA), demonstrating that
correlation alignment between high-certainty instances and test instances can
enhance test performances with a theoretical guarantee. Based on this, we
propose two simple yet effective algorithms: LinearTCA and LinearTCA+.
LinearTCA applies a simple linear transformation to achieve both instance and
correlation alignment without additional model updates, while LinearTCA+ serves
as a plug-and-play module that can easily boost existing TTA methods. Extensive
experiments validate our theoretical insights and show that TCA methods
significantly outperforms baselines across various tasks, benchmarks and
backbones. Notably, LinearTCA improves adaptation accuracy by 5.88% on
OfficeHome dataset, while using only 4% maximum GPU memory usage and 0.6%
computation time compared to the best baseline TTA method.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a method of recording brain activity that
shows significant promise in applications ranging from disease classification
to emotion detection and brain-computer interfaces. Recent advances in deep
learning have improved EEG classification performance yet model explainability
remains an issue. To address this key limitation of explainability we introduce
KnowEEG; a novel explainable machine learning approach for EEG classification.
KnowEEG extracts a comprehensive set of per-electrode features, filters them
using statistical tests, and integrates between-electrode connectivity
statistics. These features are then input to our modified Random Forest model
(Fusion Forest) that balances per electrode statistics with between electrode
connectivity features in growing the trees of the forest. By incorporating
knowledge from both the generalized time-series and EEG-specific domains,
KnowEEG achieves performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art deep
learning models across five different classification tasks: emotion detection,
mental workload classification, eyes open/closed detection, abnormal EEG
classification, and event detection. In addition to high performance, KnowEEG
provides inherent explainability through feature importance scores for
understandable features. We demonstrate by example on the eyes closed/open
classification task that this explainability can be used to discover knowledge
about the classes. This discovered knowledge for eyes open/closed
classification was proven to be correct by current neuroscience literature.
Therefore, the impact of KnowEEG will be significant for domains where EEG
explainability is critical such as healthcare.

Motivation: 强化学习中的延迟问题导致状态估计困难，现有递归预测方法容易累积误差，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出DFBT方法，直接基于观测预测状态，避免逐步递归预测中的误差累积。

Result: DFBT在D4RL离线数据集和MuJoCo基准测试中表现优异，显著减少误差并提高学习效率。

Conclusion: DFBT通过直接预测状态解决了递归预测的误差累积问题，为强化学习中的延迟问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with delays is challenging as sensory perceptions
lag behind the actual events: the RL agent needs to estimate the real state of
its environment based on past observations. State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
typically employ recursive, step-by-step forecasting of states. This can cause
the accumulation of compounding errors. To tackle this problem, our novel
belief estimation method, named Directly Forecasting Belief Transformer (DFBT),
directly forecasts states from observations without incrementally estimating
intermediate states step-by-step. We theoretically demonstrate that DFBT
greatly reduces compounding errors of existing recursively forecasting methods,
yielding stronger performance guarantees. In experiments with D4RL offline
datasets, DFBT reduces compounding errors with remarkable prediction accuracy.
DFBT's capability to forecast state sequences also facilitates multi-step
bootstrapping, thus greatly improving learning efficiency. On the MuJoCo
benchmark, our DFBT-based method substantially outperforms SOTA baselines.

Motivation: 基础模型的计算和存储复杂度高，限制了其实际应用，需要更高效的微调方法。

Method: 通过分解交错循环和对角矩阵，并利用1D FFT替代2D FFT，避免构建权重变化矩阵。

Result: 在多种任务中表现相似或更好，同时显著减少了FLOPs和可训练参数。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算复杂度，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved tremendous success in different domains.
However, their huge computation and storage complexity make these models
difficult to fine-tune and also less applicable in practice. Recent study shows
training in Fourier domain can be an effective fine-tuning method in terms of
both model performance and number of training parameters. In this work, we
propose to further reduce the complexity by the factorization through the
product of interleaved circulant and diagonal matrices. In addition, we address
the case of non-square fine-tuning weights by partitioning the circulant matrix
into blocks. Our method avoids the construction of weight change matrix and
utilizes 1D fast Fourier transform (FFT) instead of 2D FFT. Experimental
results show that our method achieves similar or better performance across
various tasks with much less floating-point operations (FLOPs) and the number
of trainable parameters.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AiT的新模型，用于处理不规则多变量时间序列的预测问题，通过动态调整权重和结合Transformer模块，显著提升了预测精度和运行效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的多变量时间序列常存在采样间隔不规则和缺失值的问题，传统线性网络难以有效建模。

Method: AiT采用自适应线性网络动态调整权重，并结合Transformer模块捕捉变量相关性。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，AiT的预测精度提升11%，运行时间减少52%。

Conclusion: AiT为解决不规则多变量时间序列预测问题提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series forecasting holds significant importance across various
industries, including finance, transportation, energy, healthcare, and climate.
Despite the widespread use of linear networks due to their low computational
cost and effectiveness in modeling temporal dependencies, most existing
research has concentrated on regularly sampled and fully observed multivariate
time series. However, in practice, we frequently encounter irregular
multivariate time series characterized by variable sampling intervals and
missing values. The inherent intra-series inconsistency and inter-series
asynchrony in such data hinder effective modeling and forecasting with
traditional linear networks relying on static weights. To tackle these
challenges, this paper introduces a novel model named AiT. AiT utilizes an
adaptive linear network capable of dynamically adjusting weights according to
observation time points to address intra-series inconsistency, thereby
enhancing the accuracy of temporal dependencies modeling. Furthermore, by
incorporating the Transformer module on variable semantics embeddings, AiT
efficiently captures variable correlations, avoiding the challenge of
inter-series asynchrony. Comprehensive experiments across four benchmark
datasets demonstrate the superiority of AiT, improving prediction accuracy by
11% and decreasing runtime by 52% compared to existing state-of-the-art
methods.

Result: 实证结果表明，Shapley值方法在空间分析中具有实用性，并与多尺度地理加权回归进行了对比。

Conclusion: 讨论了当前XAI技术的挑战和局限性，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: This chapter discusses the opportunities of eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) within the realm of spatial analysis. A key objective in
spatial analysis is to model spatial relationships and infer spatial processes
to generate knowledge from spatial data, which has been largely based on
spatial statistical methods. More recently, machine learning offers scalable
and flexible approaches that complement traditional methods and has been
increasingly applied in spatial data science. Despite its advantages, machine
learning is often criticized for being a black box, which limits our
understanding of model behavior and output. Recognizing this limitation, XAI
has emerged as a pivotal field in AI that provides methods to explain the
output of machine learning models to enhance transparency and understanding.
These methods are crucial for model diagnosis, bias detection, and ensuring the
reliability of results obtained from machine learning models. This chapter
introduces key concepts and methods in XAI with a focus on Shapley value-based
approaches, which is arguably the most popular XAI method, and their
integration with spatial analysis. An empirical example of county-level voting
behaviors in the 2020 Presidential election is presented to demonstrate the use
of Shapley values and spatial analysis with a comparison to multi-scale
geographically weighted regression. The chapter concludes with a discussion on
the challenges and limitations of current XAI techniques and proposes new
directions.

Abstract: We propose the first unified adversarial attack benchmark for Genomic

offers the first comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess
the vulnerability of GFMs to adversarial attacks. Methodologically, we evaluate
the adversarial robustness of five state-of-the-art GFMs using four widely
adopted attack algorithms and three defense strategies. Importantly, our
benchmark provides an accessible and comprehensive framework to analyze GFM
vulnerabilities with respect to model architecture, quantization schemes, and
training datasets. Empirically, transformer-based models exhibit greater
robustness to adversarial perturbations compared to HyenaDNA, highlighting the
impact of architectural design on vulnerability. Moreover, adversarial attacks
frequently target biologically significant genomic regions, suggesting that
these models effectively capture meaningful sequence features.

Result: 在TCGA BRCA数据集中发现临床相关聚类，生存一致性高，嵌入预测能力显著提升。

Conclusion: 对比学习在多组学数据中具有潜力，可用于发现生物学见解。

Abstract: Unsupervised learning of disease subtypes from multi-omics data presents a
significant opportunity for advancing personalized medicine. We introduce
OmicsCL, a modular contrastive learning framework that jointly embeds
heterogeneous omics modalities-such as gene expression, DNA methylation, and
miRNA expression-into a unified latent space. Our method incorporates a
survival-aware contrastive loss that encourages the model to learn
representations aligned with survival-related patterns, without relying on
labeled outcomes. Evaluated on the TCGA BRCA dataset, OmicsCL uncovers
clinically meaningful clusters and achieves strong unsupervised concordance
with patient survival. The framework demonstrates robustness across
hyperparameter configurations and can be tuned to prioritize either subtype
coherence or survival stratification. Ablation studies confirm that integrating
survival-aware loss significantly enhances the predictive power of learned
embeddings. These results highlight the promise of contrastive objectives for
biological insight discovery in high-dimensional, heterogeneous omics data.

Motivation: 解决连续动作空间中强化学习方法的局限性，结合确定性策略梯度和经典策略梯度的优势。

Method: 通过Wasserstein梯度流近似推导出简单通用的闭式更新方法，适用于任意分布的随机策略。

Result: 在DeepMind Control Suite和磁约束聚变任务中表现优于现有连续控制方法。

Conclusion: WPO是一种高效且通用的连续动作空间强化学习算法。

Abstract: We introduce Wasserstein Policy Optimization (WPO), an actor-critic algorithm
for reinforcement learning in continuous action spaces. WPO can be derived as
an approximation to Wasserstein gradient flow over the space of all policies
projected into a finite-dimensional parameter space (e.g., the weights of a
neural network), leading to a simple and completely general closed-form update.
The resulting algorithm combines many properties of deterministic and classic
policy gradient methods. Like deterministic policy gradients, it exploits
knowledge of the gradient of the action-value function with respect to the
action. Like classic policy gradients, it can be applied to stochastic policies
with arbitrary distributions over actions -- without using the
reparameterization trick. We show results on the DeepMind Control Suite and a
magnetic confinement fusion task which compare favorably with state-of-the-art
continuous control methods.

Motivation: 现有视频基准测试仅提供结果监督，无法评估模型是否真正结合感知和时间信息进行推理，还是仅靠偶然或语言偏见得到正确答案。

Method: 创建MINERVA数据集，包含多模态、多样化的视频问题和详细的手工推理痕迹，并进行广泛的基准测试和错误分析。

Result: 数据集对前沿开源和专有模型构成挑战，主要错误模式为时间定位和视觉感知错误。

Conclusion: MINERVA为评估视频推理能力提供了新工具，并揭示了模型的常见错误模式。

Abstract: Multimodal LLMs are turning their focus to video benchmarks, however most
video benchmarks only provide outcome supervision, with no intermediate or
interpretable reasoning steps. This makes it challenging to assess if models
are truly able to combine perceptual and temporal information to reason about
videos, or simply get the correct answer by chance or by exploiting linguistic
biases. To remedy this, we provide a new video reasoning dataset called MINERVA
for modern multimodal models. Each question in the dataset comes with 5 answer
choices, as well as detailed, hand-crafted reasoning traces. Our dataset is
multimodal, diverse in terms of video domain and length, and consists of
complex multi-step questions. Extensive benchmarking shows that our dataset
provides a challenge for frontier open-source and proprietary models. We
perform fine-grained error analysis to identify common failure modes across
various models, and create a taxonomy of reasoning errors. We use this to
explore both human and LLM-as-a-judge methods for scoring video reasoning
traces, and find that failure modes are primarily related to temporal
localization, followed by visual perception errors, as opposed to logical or
completeness errors. The dataset, along with questions, answer candidates and
reasoning traces will be publicly available under

Conclusion: 正态归一化是一种有效的归一化方法，适用于多种深度学习场景，并能显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: The normal distribution plays a central role in information theory - it is at
the same time the best-case signal and worst-case noise distribution, has the
greatest representational capacity of any distribution, and offers an
equivalence between uncorrelatedness and independence for joint distributions.
Accounting for the mean and variance of activations throughout the layers of
deep neural networks has had a significant effect on facilitating their
effective training, but seldom has a prescription for precisely what
distribution these activations should take, and how this might be achieved,
been offered. Motivated by the information-theoretic properties of the normal
distribution, we address this question and concurrently present normality
normalization: a novel normalization layer which encourages normality in the
feature representations of neural networks using the power transform and
employs additive Gaussian noise during training. Our experiments
comprehensively demonstrate the effectiveness of normality normalization, in
regards to its generalization performance on an array of widely used model and
dataset combinations, its strong performance across various common factors of
variation such as model width, depth, and training minibatch size, its
suitability for usage wherever existing normalization layers are conventionally
used, and as a means to improving model robustness to random perturbations.

Conclusion: SDE-AL框架通过子空间距离度量实现了高效的主动学习，适用于数据驱动的降阶建模。

Abstract: In situations where the solution of a high-fidelity dynamical system needs to
be evaluated repeatedly, over a vast pool of parametric configurations and in
absence of access to the underlying governing equations, data-driven model
reduction techniques are preferable. We propose a novel active learning
approach to build a parametric data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) by
greedily picking the most important parameter samples from the parameter
domain. As a result, during the ROM construction phase, the number of
high-fidelity solutions dynamically grow in a principled fashion. The
high-fidelity solution snapshots are expressed in several parameter-specific
linear subspaces, with the help of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and
the relative distance between these subspaces is used as a guiding mechanism to
perform active learning. For successfully achieving this, we provide a distance
measure to evaluate the similarity between pairs of linear subspaces with
different dimensions, and also show that this distance measure is a metric. The
usability of the proposed subspace-distance-enabled active learning (SDE-AL)
framework is demonstrated by augmenting two existing non-intrusive
reduced-order modeling approaches, and providing their active-learning-driven
(ActLearn) extensions, namely, SDE-ActLearn-POD-KSNN, and SDE-ActLearn-POD-NN.
Furthermore, we report positive results for two parametric physical models,
highlighting the efficiency of the proposed SDE-AL approach.

Abstract: Identifying key biomarkers for COVID-19 from high-dimensional multi-omics
data is critical for advancing both diagnostic and pathogenesis research. In
this study, we evaluated the applicability of the Quantum Support Vector
Machine (QSVM) algorithm for biomarker-based classification of COVID-19.
Proteomic and metabolomic biomarkers from two independent datasets were ranked
by importance using ridge regression and grouped accordingly. The top- and
bottom-ranked biomarker sets were then used to train and evaluate both
classical SVM (CSVM) and QSVM models, serving as predictive and negative
control inputs, respectively. The QSVM was implemented with multiple quantum
kernels, including amplitude encoding, angle encoding, the ZZ feature map, and
the projected quantum kernel. Across various experimental settings, QSVM
consistently achieved classification performance that was comparable to or
exceeded that of CSVM, while reflecting the importance rankings by ridge
regression. Although the experiments were conducted in numerical simulation,
our findings highlight the potential of QSVM as a promising approach for
multi-omics data analysis in biomedical research.

Abstract: We present a novel hybrid quantum-classical neural network architecture for

Notably, our hybrid approach achieves per-epoch training times in the range of
45-65 seconds, which is significantly faster than similar architectures
reported in the literature, where training typically requires several minutes

unified backpropagation procedure employing the parameter-shift rule for the
quantum parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrate competitive
improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score relative to a

Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms (QAOA) promise efficient

harnessing shallow-depth quantum circuits. Yet, their performance and
scalability often hinge on effective parameter optimization, which remains
nontrivial due to rugged energy landscapes and hardware noise. In this work, we
introduce a quantum meta-learning framework that combines quantum neural

approach rapidly generalizes to larger, more complex problems, substantially
reducing the number of iterations required for convergence. Through

Abstract: Recent advances in neural network quantum states (NQS) have enabled
high-accuracy predictions for complex quantum many-body systems such as
strongly correlated electron systems. However, the computational cost remains
prohibitive, making exploration of the diverse parameters of interaction
strengths and other physical parameters inefficient. While transfer learning
has been proposed to mitigate this challenge, achieving generalization to
large-scale systems and diverse parameter regimes remains difficult. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel curriculum learning framework based on
transfer learning for NQS. This facilitates efficient and stable exploration
across a vast parameter space of quantum many-body systems. In addition, by
interpreting NQS transfer learning through a perturbative lens, we demonstrate
how prior physical knowledge can be flexibly incorporated into the curriculum
learning process. We also propose Pairing-Net, an architecture to practically
implement this strategy for strongly correlated electron systems, and
empirically verify its effectiveness. Our results show an approximately
200-fold speedup in computation and a marked improvement in optimization
stability compared to conventional methods.

Abstract: Failure attribution in LLM multi-agent systems-identifying the agent and step
responsible for task failures-provides crucial clues for systems debugging but
remains underexplored and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose and
formulate a new research area: automated failure attribution for LLM
multi-agent systems. To support this initiative, we introduce the Who&When
dataset, comprising extensive failure logs from 127 LLM multi-agent systems
with fine-grained annotations linking failures to specific agents and decisive
error steps. Using the Who&When, we develop and evaluate three automated
failure attribution methods, summarizing their corresponding pros and cons. The
best method achieves 53.5% accuracy in identifying failure-responsible agents
but only 14.2% in pinpointing failure steps, with some methods performing below
random. Even SOTA reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1, fail to
achieve practical usability. These results highlight the task's complexity and

Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning strategy for use in multi-agent foraging
systems in which the learning is centralised to a single agent and its model is
periodically disseminated among the population of non-learning agents. In a
domain where multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is the common approach,
this approach aims to significantly reduce the computational and energy demands
compared to approaches such as MARL and centralised learning models. By
developing high performing foraging agents, these approaches can be translated
into real-world applications such as logistics, environmental monitoring, and
autonomous exploration. A reward function was incorporated into this approach
that promotes role development among agents, without explicit directives. This
led to the differentiation of behaviours among the agents. The implicit
encouragement of role differentiation allows for dynamic actions in which
agents can alter roles dependent on their interactions with the environment
without the need for explicit communication between agents.

Conclusion: 卷积自编码器在小型卫星中具有双重功能潜力，推动了机器学习与空间技术的结合。

Abstract: Small satellite technologies have enhanced the potential and feasibility of
geodesic missions, through simplification of design and decreased costs
allowing for more frequent launches. On-satellite data acquisition systems can
benefit from the implementation of machine learning (ML), for better
performance and greater efficiency on tasks such as image processing or feature
extraction. This work presents convolutional autoencoders for implementation on
the payload of small satellites, designed to achieve dual functionality of data
compression for more efficient off-satellite transmission, and at-source
anomaly detection to inform satellite data-taking. This capability is
demonstrated for a use case of disaster monitoring using aerial image datasets
of the African continent, offering avenues for both novel ML-based approaches
in small satellite applications along with the expansion of space technology
and artificial intelligence in Africa.

### [196] [Intelligent Task Scheduling for Microservices via A3C-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00299)
*Yang Wang,Tengda Tang,Zhou Fang,Yingnan Deng,Yifei Duan*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于A3C强化学习算法的自适应资源调度方法，用于解决微服务系统中资源动态性和任务并发性高的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微服务系统中资源动态性和任务并发性高，传统方法难以应对，需要一种智能调度方案。

Method: 将调度问题建模为马尔可夫决策过程，结合策略和价值网络优化，采用异步多线程学习机制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多任务并发环境下表现出高调度性能和系统稳定性，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解了高负载下传统方法的资源分配瓶颈，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: To address the challenges of high resource dynamism and intensive task
concurrency in microservice systems, this paper proposes an adaptive resource
scheduling method based on the A3C reinforcement learning algorithm. The
scheduling problem is modeled as a Markov Decision Process, where policy and
value networks are jointly optimized to enable fine-grained resource allocation
under varying load conditions. The method incorporates an asynchronous
multi-threaded learning mechanism, allowing multiple agents to perform parallel
sampling and synchronize updates to the global network parameters. This design
improves both policy convergence efficiency and model stability. In the
experimental section, a real-world dataset is used to construct a scheduling
scenario. The proposed method is compared with several typical approaches
across multiple evaluation metrics, including task delay, scheduling success
rate, resource utilization, and convergence speed. The results show that the
proposed method delivers high scheduling performance and system stability in
multi-task concurrent environments. It effectively alleviates the resource
allocation bottlenecks faced by traditional methods under heavy load,
demonstrating its practical value for intelligent scheduling in microservice
systems.

*Taiga Hayami,Kakeru Koizumi,Hiroshi Watanabe*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合超分辨率网络的INR视频表示方法，显著提升了高频细节的重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统INR方法在严格模型大小限制下难以重建高频细节，而高频细节在视频压缩中至关重要。

Method: 通过集成通用超分辨率网络，将高频细节的重建任务交给该网络，利用高频分量时间冗余低的特性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在重建质量上优于传统INR基线，同时保持相近的模型大小。

Conclusion: 该方法为视频压缩提供了一种高效的INR解决方案，兼顾了模型大小和重建质量。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have garnered significant attention
for their ability to model complex signals across a variety of domains.
Recently, INR-based approaches have emerged as promising frameworks for neural
video compression. While conventional methods primarily focus on embedding
video content into compact neural networks for efficient representation, they
often struggle to reconstruct high-frequency details under stringent model size
constraints, which are critical in practical compression scenarios. To address
this limitation, we propose an INR-based video representation method that
integrates a general-purpose super-resolution (SR) network. Motivated by the
observation that high-frequency components exhibit low temporal redundancy
across frames, our method entrusts the reconstruction of fine details to the SR
network. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
conventional INR-based baselines in terms of reconstruction quality, while
maintaining comparable model sizes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于脊髓神经根的新型配准方法，显著提高了脊髓功能MRI研究的配准精度和可重复性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于椎间盘的配准方法因个体间解剖变异大，导致配准不准确。

Method: 利用颈背侧神经根的分割和非线性配准技术，与PAM50脊髓模板对齐。

Result: 在多中心和不同颈部位置的验证中，根基配准优于传统方法，显著提高了任务功能MRI的激活检测。

Conclusion: 根基配准提升了脊髓神经影像的精度和可靠性，为群体分析提供了更好的空间标准化。

Abstract: Spinal cord functional MRI studies require precise localization of spinal
levels for reliable voxelwise group analyses. Traditional template-based
registration of the spinal cord uses intervertebral discs for alignment.
However, substantial anatomical variability across individuals exists between
vertebral and spinal levels. This study proposes a novel registration approach
that leverages spinal nerve rootlets to improve alignment accuracy and
reproducibility across individuals. We developed a registration method
leveraging dorsal cervical rootlets segmentation and aligning them non-linearly
with the PAM50 spinal cord template. Validation was performed on a
multi-subject, multi-site dataset (n=267, 44 sites) and a multi-subject dataset
with various neck positions (n=10, 3 sessions). We further validated the method
on task-based functional MRI (n=23) to compare group-level activation maps
using rootlet-based registration to traditional disc-based methods.
Rootlet-based registration showed superior alignment across individuals
compared to the traditional disc-based method. Notably, rootlet positions were
more stable across neck positions. Group-level analysis of task-based
functional MRI using rootlet-based increased Z scores and activation cluster
size compared to disc-based registration (number of active voxels from 3292 to
7978). Rootlet-based registration enhances both inter- and intra-subject
anatomical alignment and yields better spatial normalization for group-level
fMRI analyses. Our findings highlight the potential of rootlet-based
registration to improve the precision and reliability of spinal cord
neuroimaging group analysis.

Motivation: 现有盲协调方法存在3D切片异质性、图像质量中等及大域差距性能有限的问题。

Method: 采用3D修正流训练目标域图像，从边缘图重建原始图像，通过多步长补丁训练和细化模块提升性能。

Result: 实验表明BlindHarmonyDiff优于现有方法，能更好地协调源域图像与目标域特征。

Conclusion: BlindHarmonyDiff在多样MR扫描仪上表现出高效、鲁棒的盲协调能力，适用于下游任务。

Abstract: Blind harmonization has emerged as a promising technique for MR image
harmonization to achieve scale-invariant representations, requiring only target
domain data (i.e., no source domain data necessary). However, existing methods
face limitations such as inter-slice heterogeneity in 3D, moderate image
quality, and limited performance for a large domain gap. To address these
challenges, we introduce BlindHarmonyDiff, a novel blind 3D harmonization
framework that leverages an edge-to-image model tailored specifically to
harmonization. Our framework employs a 3D rectified flow trained on target
domain images to reconstruct the original image from an edge map, then yielding
a harmonized image from the edge of a source domain image. We propose
multi-stride patch training for efficient 3D training and a refinement module
for robust inference by suppressing hallucination. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BlindHarmonyDiff outperforms prior arts by harmonizing diverse
source domain images to the target domain, achieving higher correspondence to
the target domain characteristics. Downstream task-based quality assessments
such as tissue segmentation and age prediction on diverse MR scanners further
confirm the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrate the capability of our
robust and generalizable blind harmonization.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的深度可分离扩张卷积网络（DSDCN），用于解决高光谱图像超分辨率问题，结合了多种损失函数以保持光谱和空间细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱超分辨率因数据的高光谱维度和训练样本稀缺而成为病态问题，现有方法依赖大模型或额外图像融合，不实用。

Method: 采用类似MobileNet的深度可分离卷积，并引入扩张卷积融合块，结合MSE、L2正则化和光谱角损失函数。

Result: 在两个公开高光谱数据集上表现优异，适合高光谱图像超分辨率任务。

Conclusion: DSDCN是一种轻量且高效的解决方案，适用于实际场景中的高光谱超分辨率问题。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated highly competitive performance in
super-resolution (SR) for natural images by learning mappings from
low-resolution (LR) to high-resolution (HR) images. However, hyperspectral
super-resolution remains an ill-posed problem due to the high spectral
dimensionality of the data and the scarcity of available training samples.
Moreover, existing methods often rely on large models with a high number of
parameters or require the fusion with panchromatic or RGB images, both of which
are often impractical in real-world scenarios. Inspired by the MobileNet
architecture, we introduce a lightweight depthwise separable dilated
convolutional network (DSDCN) to address the aforementioned challenges.
Specifically, our model leverages multiple depthwise separable convolutions,
similar to the MobileNet architecture, and further incorporates a dilated
convolution fusion block to make the model more flexible for the extraction of
both spatial and spectral features. In addition, we propose a custom loss
function that combines mean squared error (MSE), an L2 norm
regularization-based constraint, and a spectral angle-based loss, ensuring the
preservation of both spectral and spatial details. The proposed model achieves
very competitive performance on two publicly available hyperspectral datasets,
making it well-suited for hyperspectral image super-resolution tasks. The

Conclusion: 通过多模态数据和前沿机器学习技术，本研究推动了PD诊断的进步，有望改善患者护理。

Abstract: Parkinsons Disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily
affects motor functions and can lead to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
dementia in its advanced stages. With approximately 10 million people diagnosed
globally 1 to 1.8 per 1,000 individuals, according to reports by the Japan
Times and the Parkinson Foundation early and accurate diagnosis of PD is
crucial for improving patient outcomes. While numerous studies have utilized
machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for PD recognition,
existing surveys are limited in scope, often focusing on single data modalities
and failing to capture the potential of multimodal approaches. To address these
gaps, this study presents a comprehensive review of PD recognition systems
across diverse data modalities, including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),
gait-based pose analysis, gait sensory data, handwriting analysis, speech test
data, Electroencephalography (EEG), and multimodal fusion techniques. Based on
over 347 articles from leading scientific databases, this review examines key
aspects such as data collection methods, settings, feature representations, and
system performance, with a focus on recognition accuracy and robustness. This
survey aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers, providing
actionable guidance for the development of next generation PD recognition
systems. By leveraging diverse data modalities and cutting-edge machine
learning paradigms, this work contributes to advancing the state of PD
diagnostics and improving patient care through innovative, multimodal
approaches.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型外体积去除（OVR）方法，结合深度学习（DL）和物理驱动DL（PD-DL），用于实时动态MRI中的伪影消除，提高加速率并保持诊断质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时动态MRI在捕捉快速生理过程中至关重要，但高加速率下伪影问题严重，影响心脏功能评估。

Method: 通过时间交错欠采样模式估计外体积信号，利用DL模型去除伪影，再通过PD-DL方法重建高分辨率图像。

Result: 在高加速率下，图像质量与临床基线图像相当，优于传统重建方法。

Conclusion: 该方法无需修改采集过程，即可有效减少伪影，为实时动态MRI提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time (RT) dynamic MRI plays a vital role in capturing rapid
physiological processes, offering unique insights into organ motion and
function. Among these applications, RT cine MRI is particularly important for
functional assessment of the heart with high temporal resolution. RT imaging
enables free-breathing, ungated imaging of cardiac motion, making it a crucial
alternative for patients who cannot tolerate conventional breath-hold,
ECG-gated acquisitions. However, achieving high acceleration rates in RT cine
MRI is challenging due to aliasing artifacts from extra-cardiac tissues,
particularly at high undersampling factors. In this study, we propose a novel
outer volume removal (OVR) method to address this challenge by eliminating
aliasing contributions from non-cardiac regions in a post-processing framework.
Our approach estimates the outer volume signal for each timeframe using
composite temporal images from time-interleaved undersampling patterns, which
inherently contain pseudo-periodic ghosting artifacts. A deep learning (DL)
model is trained to identify and remove these artifacts, producing a clean
outer volume estimate that is subsequently subtracted from the corresponding
k-space data. The final reconstruction is performed with a physics-driven DL
(PD-DL) method trained using an OVR-specific loss function to restore high
spatio-temporal resolution images. Experimental results show that the proposed
method at high accelerations achieves image quality that is visually comparable
to clinical baseline images, while outperforming conventional reconstruction
techniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The proposed approach
provides a practical and effective solution for artifact reduction in RT cine
MRI without requiring acquisition modifications, offering a pathway to higher
acceleration rates while preserving diagnostic quality.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: GuideSR是一种新型单步扩散图像超分辨率模型，通过双分支架构提升图像保真度，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散超分辨率方法在生成模型基础上添加额外条件，常导致结构保真度下降。GuideSR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用双分支架构：引导分支保留高保真结构，扩散分支利用预训练潜在扩散模型提升感知质量。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优异，PSNR提升达1.39dB，各项指标领先。

Conclusion: GuideSR在保持低计算成本的同时，实现了图像恢复的实用进步。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose GuideSR, a novel single-step diffusion-based image
super-resolution (SR) model specifically designed to enhance image fidelity.
Existing diffusion-based SR approaches typically adapt pre-trained generative
models to image restoration tasks by adding extra conditioning on a
VAE-downsampled representation of the degraded input, which often compromises
structural fidelity. GuideSR addresses this limitation by introducing a
dual-branch architecture comprising: (1) a Guidance Branch that preserves
high-fidelity structures from the original-resolution degraded input, and (2) a
Diffusion Branch, which a pre-trained latent diffusion model to enhance
perceptual quality. Unlike conventional conditioning mechanisms, our Guidance
Branch features a tailored structure for image restoration tasks, combining
Full Resolution Blocks (FRBs) with channel attention and an Image Guidance
Network (IGN) with guided attention. By embedding detailed structural
information directly into the restoration pipeline, GuideSR produces sharper
and more visually consistent results. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that GuideSR achieves state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining the low computational cost of single-step approaches, with up to
1.39dB PSNR gain on challenging real-world datasets. Our approach consistently
outperforms existing methods across various reference-based metrics including
PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, DISTS and FID, further representing a practical advancement
for real-world image restoration.

Conclusion: 结合先进机器学习技术、密度泛函理论和微动力学模型，为复杂反应（如反向水煤气变换）的催化剂筛选提供了高效框架。

Abstract: Obtaining accurate transition state (TS) energies is a bottleneck in
computational screening of complex materials and reaction networks due to the
high cost of TS search methods and first-principles methods such as density
functional theory (DFT). Here we propose a machine learning (ML) model for
predicting TS energies based on Gaussian process regression with the
Wasserstein Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel (WWL-GPR). Applying the model to
predict adsorption and TS energies for the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS)
reaction on single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts, we show that it can
significantly improve the accuracy compared to traditional approaches based on
scaling relations or ML models without a graph representation. Further
benefitting from the low cost of model training, we train an ensemble of
WWL-GPR models to obtain uncertainties through subsampling of the training data
and show how these uncertainties propagate to turnover frequency (TOF)
predictions through the construction of an ensemble of microkinetic models.
Comparing the errors in model-based vs DFT-based TOF predictions, we show that
the WWL-GPR model reduces errors by almost an order of magnitude compared to
scaling relations. This demonstrates the critical impact of accurate energy
predictions on catalytic activity estimation. Finally, we apply our model to
screen new materials, identifying promising catalysts for RWGS. This work
highlights the power of combining advanced ML techniques with DFT and
microkinetic modeling for screening catalysts for complex reactions like RWGS,
providing a robust framework for future catalyst design.

Abstract: Effective data visualization requires not only technical proficiency but also
a deep understanding of the domain-specific context in which data exists. This
context often includes tacit knowledge about data provenance, quality, and
intended use, which is rarely explicit in the dataset itself. We present the
Data Therapist, a web-based tool that helps domain experts externalize this
implicit knowledge through a mixed-initiative process combining iterative Q&A
with interactive annotation. Powered by a large language model, the system
analyzes user-supplied datasets, prompts users with targeted questions, and
allows annotation at varying levels of granularity. The resulting structured
knowledge base can inform both human and automated visualization design. We
evaluated the tool in a qualitative study involving expert pairs from Molecular
Biology, Accounting, Political Science, and Usable Security. The study revealed
recurring patterns in how experts reason about their data and highlights areas
where AI support can improve visualization design.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have demonstrated an enormous utility of
deep learning approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for
materials science. These methods have emerged as powerful tools for
high-throughput prediction of material properties, offering a compelling
enhancement and alternative to traditional first-principles calculations. While
the community has predominantly focused on developing increasingly complex and
universal models to enhance predictive accuracy, such approaches often lack
physical interpretability and insights into materials behavior. Here, we
introduce a novel computational paradigm, Self-Adaptable Graph Attention
Networks integrated with Symbolic Regression (SA-GAT-SR), that synergistically
combines the predictive capability of GNNs with the interpretative power of
symbolic regression. Our framework employs a self-adaptable encoding algorithm
that automatically identifies and adjust attention weights so as to screen
critical features from an expansive 180-dimensional feature space while
maintaining O(n) computational scaling. The integrated SR module subsequently
distills these features into compact analytical expressions that explicitly
reveal quantum-mechanically meaningful relationships, achieving 23 times
acceleration compared to conventional SR implementations that heavily rely on
first principle calculations-derived features as input. This work suggests a
new framework in computational materials science, bridging the gap between
predictive accuracy and physical interpretability, offering valuable physical
insights into material behavior.

Abstract: Generating realistic and controllable weather effects in videos is valuable
for many applications. Physics-based weather simulation requires precise

video editing often lacks realism and control. In this work, we introduce
WeatherWeaver, a video diffusion model that synthesizes diverse weather effects
-- including rain, snow, fog, and clouds -- directly into any input video
without the need for 3D modeling. Our model provides precise control over
weather effect intensity and supports blending various weather types, ensuring
both realism and adaptability. To overcome the scarcity of paired training
data, we propose a novel data strategy combining synthetic videos, generative
image editing, and auto-labeled real-world videos. Extensive evaluations show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in weather simulation and
removal, providing high-quality, physically plausible, and

Conclusion: 机制可解释性技术为神经网络在生物统计因果推断中的应用提供了新的透明度和验证方法。

Abstract: Interpretable insights from predictive models remain critical in
bio-statistics, particularly when assessing causality, where classical
statistical and machine learning methods often provide inherent clarity. While
Neural Networks (NNs) offer powerful capabilities for modeling complex
biological data, their traditional "black-box" nature presents challenges for
validation and trust in high-stakes health applications. Recent advances in
Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aim to decipher the internal computations
learned by these networks. This work investigates the application of MI
techniques to NNs within the context of causal inference for bio-statistics.
  We demonstrate that MI tools can be leveraged to: (1) probe and validate the
internal representations learned by NNs, such as those estimating nuisance
functions in frameworks like Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimation (TMLE); (2)
discover and visualize the distinct computational pathways employed by the
network to process different types of inputs, potentially revealing how
confounders and treatments are handled; and (3) provide methodologies for
comparing the learned mechanisms and extracted insights across statistical,
machine learning, and NN models, fostering a deeper understanding of their
respective strengths and weaknesses for causal bio-statistical analysis.

### [210] [Over-the-Air Inference over Multi-hop MIMO Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00430)
*Chenghong Bian,Meng Hua,Deniz Gunduz*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种多跳MIMO网络中的新型空中机器学习框架，通过设计预编码矩阵模仿全连接神经网络层，实现分类任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多跳MIMO网络中高效传输和分类的问题，同时满足功率约束。

Method: 设计PrototypeNet神经网络，通过优化预编码矩阵和定制损失函数（分类误差和潜在向量功率）进行训练。

Result: 在功率约束下实现满意的分类准确率，且多跳结构在适中信噪比下提升准确率。

Conclusion: 该框架在多跳MIMO网络中有效，分类性能随跳数增加而提升。

Abstract: A novel over-the-air machine learning framework over multi-hop multiple-input
and multiple-output (MIMO) networks is proposed. The core idea is to imitate
fully connected (FC) neural network layers using multiple MIMO channels by
carefully designing the precoding matrices at the transmitting nodes. A neural
network dubbed PrototypeNet is employed consisting of multiple FC layers, with
the number of neurons of each layer equal to the number of antennas of the
corresponding terminal. To achieve satisfactory performance, we train
PrototypeNet based on a customized loss function consisting of classification
error and the power of latent vectors to satisfy transmit power constraints,
with noise injection during training. Precoding matrices for each hop are then
obtained by solving an optimization problem. We also propose a multiple-block
extension when the number of antennas is limited. Numerical results verify that
the proposed over-the-air transmission scheme can achieve satisfactory
classification accuracy under a power constraint. The results also show that
higher classification accuracy can be achieved with an increasing number of
hops at a modest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

*Shingo Higashiguchi,Yasuko Matsubara,Koki Kawabata,Taichi Murayama,Yasushi Sakurai*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: D-Tracker是一种用于从高维社会活动数据流中捕捉时变模式并预测未来活动的方法，具有可解释性、自动化和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会活动数据（如搜索量和传染病数据）反映了人们的兴趣和行为，但因其高维和时变特性，建模和预测具有挑战性。

Method: D-Tracker将偏微分方程融入张量分解框架，自动捕捉趋势、季节性和兴趣扩散等时变模式。

Result: 实验表明，D-Tracker在预测准确性和计算效率上优于现有方法，并能提取位置间的兴趣扩散。

Conclusion: D-Tracker是一种高效且可解释的社会活动数据流建模和预测工具。

Abstract: Large quantities of social activity data, such as weekly web search volumes
and the number of new infections with infectious diseases, reflect peoples'
interests and activities. It is important to discover temporal patterns from
such data and to forecast future activities accurately. However, modeling and
forecasting social activity data streams is difficult because they are
high-dimensional and composed of multiple time-varying dynamics such as trends,
seasonality, and interest diffusion. In this paper, we propose D-Tracker, a
method for continuously capturing time-varying temporal patterns within social
activity tensor data streams and forecasting future activities. Our proposed
method has the following properties: (a) Interpretable: it incorporates the
partial differential equation into a tensor decomposition framework and
captures time-varying temporal patterns such as trends, seasonality, and
interest diffusion between locations in an interpretable manner; (b) Automatic:
it has no hyperparameters and continuously models tensor data streams fully
automatically; (c) Scalable: the computation time of D-Tracker is independent
of the time series length. Experiments using web search volume data obtained
from GoogleTrends, and COVID-19 infection data obtained from COVID-19 Open Data
Repository show that our method can achieve higher forecasting accuracy in less
computation time than existing methods while extracting the interest diffusion
between locations. Our source code and datasets are available at

### [212] [Evaluating the AI-Lab Intervention: Impact on Student Perception and Use of Generative AI in Early Undergraduate Computer Science Courses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00100)
*Ethan Dickey,Andres Bejarano,Rhianna Kuperus,Bárbara Fagundes*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究探讨了生成式AI（GenAI）在计算机科学教育中的影响，通过“AI-Lab”干预措施，结合定量和定性方法分析学生使用模式和态度变化。结果显示，结构化干预能帮助学生更有效地利用GenAI，同时提升技能意识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在教育中的应用日益广泛，但其对学生学习、技能发展和认知的影响尚未充分研究。研究旨在填补这一空白，探索如何通过结构化干预引导学生合理使用AI工具。

Method: 研究在普渡大学的四门课程中引入“AI-Lab”模块，收集了831份匹配的干预前后调查数据，并结合焦点小组讨论，采用混合方法分析数据。

Result: 干预后，学生在调试和作业问题上的使用模式显著改变，表现出更高的舒适度和开放性。焦点小组讨论证实了干预帮助学生从盲目使用转向更反思性的AI工具整合。

Conclusion: 结构化干预能有效平衡GenAI的使用与核心能力培养，为教育者提供了将AI融入课程的实践建议，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly entering computer science education, yet its
effects on student learning, skill development, and perceptions remain
underexplored. Concerns about overreliance coexist with a gap in research on
structured scaffolding to guide tool use in formal courses. This study examines
the impact of a dedicated "AI-Lab" intervention -- emphasizing guided
scaffolding and mindful engagement -- on undergraduate students in Data
Structures and Algorithms, Competitive Programming, and first-year engineering
courses at Purdue University.
  Over three semesters, we integrated AI-Lab modules into four mandatory and
elective courses, yielding 831 matched pre- and post-intervention survey
responses, alongside focus group discussions. Employing a mixed-methods
approach, we analyzed quantitative shifts in usage patterns and attitudes as
well as qualitative narratives of student experiences.
  While the overall frequency of GenAI usage for homework or programming
projects remained largely stable, we observed large effect sizes in comfort and
openness across conceptual, debugging, and homework problems. Notably, usage
patterns for debugging also shifted statistically significantly, reflecting
students' more mindful and deliberate approach. Focus group discussions
corroborated these results, suggesting that the intervention "bridged the gap"
between naive GenAI usage and more nuanced, reflective integration of AI tools
into coursework, ultimately heightening students' awareness of their own skill
development.
  These findings suggest that structured, scaffolded interventions can enable
students to harness GenAI's benefits without undermining essential
competencies. We offer evidence-based recommendations for educators seeking to
integrate GenAI responsibly into computing curricula and identify avenues for
future research on GenAI-supported pedagogy.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文系统回顾了将心理学理论应用于大语言模型（LLMs）的六个关键维度，包括评估工具、数据集、评估指标、实证发现、人格模拟方法和行为模拟，并指出了当前方法的优缺点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在人类中心任务中的广泛应用，评估其心理特质对于理解其社会影响和确保可信AI对齐至关重要。现有研究未系统讨论心理学测试、LLM专用数据集及其应用。

Method: 系统回顾了六个维度：评估工具、LLM专用数据集、评估指标（一致性和稳定性）、实证发现、人格模拟方法和行为模拟。

Result: 部分LLMs在特定提示方案下表现出可复现的人格模式，但任务和设置间存在显著变异性。方法学挑战包括心理学工具与LLMs能力的不匹配及评估实践的不一致。

Conclusion: 研究旨在为开发更可解释、稳健和通用的LLMs心理评估框架提出未来方向。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in human-centered
tasks, assessing their psychological traits is crucial for understanding their
social impact and ensuring trustworthy AI alignment. While existing reviews
have covered some aspects of related research, several important areas have not
been systematically discussed, including detailed discussions of diverse
psychological tests, LLM-specific psychological datasets, and the applications
of LLMs with psychological traits. To address this gap, we systematically
review six key dimensions of applying psychological theories to LLMs: (1)
assessment tools; (2) LLM-specific datasets; (3) evaluation metrics
(consistency and stability); (4) empirical findings; (5) personality simulation
methods; and (6) LLM-based behavior simulation. Our analysis highlights both
the strengths and limitations of current methods. While some LLMs exhibit
reproducible personality patterns under specific prompting schemes, significant
variability remains across tasks and settings. Recognizing methodological
challenges such as mismatches between psychological tools and LLMs'
capabilities, as well as inconsistencies in evaluation practices, this study
aims to propose future directions for developing more interpretable, robust,
and generalizable psychological assessment frameworks for LLMs.

### [214] [Algorithmic Collective Action with Two Collectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00195)
*Aditya Karan,Nicholas Vincent,Karrie Karahalios,Hari Sundaram*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种研究多个集体如何通过策略行为操纵数据驱动系统的框架，发现集体间的互动会显著影响各自目标的实现效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据依赖算法系统在更多领域产生影响，个人需要通过集体行动来维护自身利益并问责算法。

Method: 引入一个框架，研究两个或多个集体如何策略性地操纵数据驱动系统，并通过实验验证其效果。

Result: 集体间的互动可能导致目标实现效果下降75%，集体规模和异质性对效果的影响显著。

Conclusion: 研究强调了算法透明性和集体行动的重要性，为个人利用数据维护利益提供了框架。

Abstract: Given that data-dependent algorithmic systems have become impactful in more
domains of life, the need for individuals to promote their own interests and
hold algorithms accountable has grown. To have meaningful influence,
individuals must band together to engage in collective action. Groups that
engage in such algorithmic collective action are likely to vary in size,
membership characteristics, and crucially, objectives. In this work, we
introduce a first of a kind framework for studying collective action with two
or more collectives that strategically behave to manipulate data-driven
systems. With more than one collective acting on a system, unexpected
interactions may occur. We use this framework to conduct experiments with
language model-based classifiers and recommender systems where two collectives
each attempt to achieve their own individual objectives. We examine how
differing objectives, strategies, sizes, and homogeneity can impact a
collective's efficacy. We find that the unintentional interactions between
collectives can be quite significant; a collective acting in isolation may be
able to achieve their objective (e.g., improve classification outcomes for
themselves or promote a particular item), but when a second collective acts
simultaneously, the efficacy of the first group drops by as much as $75\%$. We
find that, in the recommender system context, neither fully heterogeneous nor
fully homogeneous collectives stand out as most efficacious and that
heterogeneity's impact is secondary compared to collective size. Our results
signal the need for more transparency in both the underlying algorithmic models
and the different behaviors individuals or collectives may take on these
systems. This approach also allows collectives to hold algorithmic system
developers accountable and provides a framework for people to actively use
their own data to promote their own interests.

### [215] [A Unifying Framework for Robust and Efficient Inference with Unstructured Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00282)
*Jacob Carlson,Melissa Dell*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 本文提出了MARS框架，通过将非结构化数据推断问题转化为缺失结构化数据问题，利用深度神经网络生成结构化数据，并结合半参数推断方法，提供高效、稳健的估计器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经济学家常使用非结构化数据（如文本、图像）进行分析，但深度神经网络的预测可能存在偏差，影响估计结果。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 将非结构化数据推断问题重新定义为缺失结构化数据问题，利用深度神经网络填补缺失数据，并应用半参数推断方法。

Result: 提出了MARS框架，能够生成高效、稳健的估计器，适用于描述性和因果性估计，并在实际研究中验证了其价值。

Conclusion: MARS为基于非结构化数据的推断提供了统一且实用的解决方案，填补了现有文献的空白。

Abstract: This paper presents a general framework for conducting efficient and robust
inference on parameters derived from unstructured data, which include text,
images, audio, and video. Economists have long incorporated data extracted from
texts and images into their analyses, a practice that has accelerated with
advancements in deep neural networks. However, neural networks do not
generically produce unbiased predictions, potentially propagating bias to
estimators that use their outputs. To address this challenge, we reframe
inference with unstructured data as a missing structured data problem, where
structured data are imputed from unstructured inputs using deep neural
networks. This perspective allows us to apply classic results from
semiparametric inference, yielding valid, efficient, and robust estimators
based on unstructured data. We formalize this approach with MARS (Missing At
Random Structured Data), a unifying framework that integrates and extends
existing methods for debiased inference using machine learning predictions,
linking them to a variety of older, familiar problems such as causal inference.
We develop robust and efficient estimators for both descriptive and causal
estimands and address challenges such as inference using aggregated and
transformed predictions from unstructured data. Importantly, MARS applies to
common empirical settings that have received limited attention in the existing
literature. Finally, we reanalyze prominent studies that use unstructured data,
demonstrating the practical value of MARS.

*Yanhao 'Max' Wei,Zhenling Jiang*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种预训练的结构计量经济学模型估计器，通过神经网络识别参数，显著减少后续应用的计算成本和研究者工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统结构计量经济学模型估计成本高且耗时，预训练估计器可以降低后续应用的负担。

Method: 利用神经网络识别模型参数，构建预训练估计器，并在14个真实数据集上测试。

Result: 估计器运行速度快（秒级），准确性高，已在网站上提供。

Conclusion: 预训练估计器有助于提高结构模型的普及性和实用性。

Abstract: We explore pretraining estimators for structural econometric models. The
estimator is "pretrained" in the sense that the bulk of the computational cost
and researcher effort occur during the construction of the estimator.
Subsequent applications of the estimator to different datasets require little
computational cost or researcher effort. The estimation leverages a neural net
to recognize the structural model's parameter from data patterns. As an initial
trial, this paper builds a pretrained estimator for a sequential search model
that is known to be difficult to estimate. We evaluate the pretrained estimator
on 14 real datasets. The estimation takes seconds to run and shows high
accuracy. We provide the estimator at pnnehome.github.io. More generally,
pretrained, off-the-shelf estimators can make structural models more accessible
to researchers and practitioners.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了边缘大模型（edge LAM）在6G中的机遇与挑战，提出了协作微调和全参数训练框架，以及微服务辅助推理架构，并研究了其在信道预测和波束成形中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘大模型（edge LAM）具有广泛的任务支持能力，但其部署面临通信、计算和存储资源的限制，需要解决模型分解和资源管理问题。

Method: 提出协作微调和全参数训练框架，以及微服务辅助推理架构，并研究其在信道预测和波束成形中的应用。

Result: 这些框架和应用为6G技术的推进提供了有价值的见解和解决方案。

Conclusion: 边缘LAM在6G中具有潜力，但仍需克服资源限制，提出的框架和应用为其部署提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) possess human-like abilities to
solve a wide range of real-world problems, exemplifying the potential of
experts in various domains and modalities. By leveraging the communication and
computation capabilities of geographically dispersed edge devices, edge LAM
emerges as an enabling technology to empower the delivery of various real-time
intelligent services in 6G. Unlike traditional edge artificial intelligence
(AI) that primarily supports a single task using small models, edge LAM is
featured by the need of the decomposition and distributed deployment of large
models, and the ability to support highly generalized and diverse tasks.
However, due to limited communication, computation, and storage resources over
wireless networks, the vast number of trainable neurons and the substantial
communication overhead pose a formidable hurdle to the practical deployment of
edge LAMs. In this paper, we investigate the opportunities and challenges of
edge LAMs from the perspectives of model decomposition and resource management.
Specifically, we propose collaborative fine-tuning and full-parameter training
frameworks, alongside a microservice-assisted inference architecture, to
enhance the deployment of edge LAM over wireless networks. Additionally, we
investigate the application of edge LAM in air-interface designs, focusing on
channel prediction and beamforming. These innovative frameworks and
applications offer valuable insights and solutions for advancing 6G technology.

TL;DR: 该研究首次全面分析了匿名化病理语音的感知效果，发现匿名化虽能保护隐私，但显著降低语音质量，且效果因疾病类型而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索匿名化技术对病理语音的感知影响，以平衡隐私保护与语音质量的需求。

Method: 采用结构化感知协议，由10名母语和非母语德语听者对180名不同病理类型患者的匿名化-原始语音对进行评估，包括图灵式辨别和质量评分任务。

Result: 匿名化显著降低语音质量（从83%降至59%），辨别准确率高（91%-93%），但效果因疾病类型不同。人类感知结果与自动隐私或临床效用指标无关。

Conclusion: 需开发针对疾病和上下文定制的匿名化策略，以在保护隐私的同时保持语音的可解释性和诊断价值。

Abstract: Automatic anonymization techniques are essential for ethical sharing of
pathological speech data, yet their perceptual consequences remain
understudied. This study presents the first comprehensive human-centered
analysis of anonymized pathological speech, using a structured perceptual
protocol involving ten native and non-native German listeners with diverse
linguistic, clinical, and technical backgrounds. Listeners evaluated
anonymized-original utterance pairs from 180 speakers spanning Cleft Lip and
Palate, Dysarthria, Dysglossia, Dysphonia, and age-matched healthy controls.
Speech was anonymized using state-of-the-art automatic methods (equal error
rates in the range of 30-40%). Listeners completed Turing-style discrimination
and quality rating tasks under zero-shot (single-exposure) and few-shot
(repeated-exposure) conditions. Discrimination accuracy was high overall (91%
zero-shot; 93% few-shot), but varied by disorder (repeated-measures ANOVA:
p=0.007), ranging from 96% (Dysarthria) to 86% (Dysphonia). Anonymization
consistently reduced perceived quality (from 83% to 59%, p<0.001), with
pathology-specific degradation patterns (one-way ANOVA: p=0.005). Native
listeners rated original speech slightly higher than non-native listeners
(Delta=4%, p=0.199), but this difference nearly disappeared after anonymization
(Delta=1%, p=0.724). No significant gender-based bias was observed. Critically,
human perceptual outcomes did not correlate with automatic privacy or clinical
utility metrics. These results underscore the need for listener-informed,
disorder- and context-specific anonymization strategies that preserve privacy
while maintaining interpretability, communicative functions, and diagnostic
utility, especially for vulnerable populations such as children.

Result: 证明了跳跃连接或线性激活神经元可以显著提升网络的表达能力，并提供了具体的理论边界。

Conclusion: 改进后的深度Heaviside网络在非参数回归等任务中具有更好的性能和理论保证。

Abstract: We show that deep Heaviside networks (DHNs) have limited expressiveness but
that this can be overcome by including either skip connections or neurons with
linear activation. We provide lower and upper bounds for the
Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimensions and approximation rates of these network
classes. As an application, we derive statistical convergence rates for DHN
fits in the nonparametric regression model.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of offline policy learning in
reinforcement learning with continuous action spaces when unmeasured
confounders are present. While most existing research focuses on policy
evaluation within partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and
assumes discrete action spaces, we advance this field by establishing a novel
identification result to enable the nonparametric estimation of policy value
for a given target policy under an infinite-horizon framework. Leveraging this
identification, we develop a minimax estimator and introduce a
policy-gradient-based algorithm to identify the in-class optimal policy that
maximizes the estimated policy value. Furthermore, we provide theoretical
results regarding the consistency, finite-sample error bound, and regret bound
of the resulting optimal policy. Extensive simulations and a real-world
application using the German Family Panel data demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed methodology.

Abstract: Robust estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects is a fundamental
challenge for optimal decision-making in domains ranging from personalized
medicine to educational policy. In recent years, predictive machine learning
has emerged as a valuable toolbox for causal estimation, enabling more flexible
effect estimation. However, accurately estimating conditional average treatment
effects (CATE) remains a major challenge, particularly in the presence of many
covariates. In this article, we propose pretraining strategies that leverages a
phenomenon in real-world applications: factors that are prognostic of the
outcome are frequently also predictive of treatment effect heterogeneity. In
medicine, for example, components of the same biological signaling pathways
frequently influence both baseline risk and treatment response. Specifically,
we demonstrate our approach within the R-learner framework, which estimates the
CATE by solving individual prediction problems based on a residualized loss. We
use this structure to incorporate "side information" and develop models that
can exploit synergies between risk prediction and causal effect estimation. In
settings where these synergies are present, this cross-task learning enables
more accurate signal detection: yields lower estimation error, reduced false
discovery rates, and higher power for detecting heterogeneity.

Method: 提出RuleSHAP框架，结合稀疏贝叶斯回归、树集成和Shapley值，并推导了高效计算边际Shapley值的公式。

Result: 在模拟数据上验证了框架的有效性，并在流行病学队列数据中检测到年龄、性别、BMI等特征的非线性交互作用。

Conclusion: RuleSHAP为流行病学中的复杂模式发现和推断提供了有效工具，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: In epidemiological settings, Machine Learning (ML) is gaining popularity for
hypothesis-free discovery of risk (or protective) factors. Although ML is
strong at discovering non-linearities and interactions, this power is currently
compromised by a lack of reliable inference. Although local measures of feature
effect can be combined with tree ensembles, uncertainty quantifications for
these measures remain only partially available and oftentimes unsatisfactory.
We propose RuleSHAP, a framework for using rule-based, hypothesis-free
discovery that combines sparse Bayesian regression, tree ensembles and Shapley
values in a one-step procedure that both detects and tests complex patterns at
the individual level. To ease computation, we derive a formula that computes
marginal Shapley values more efficiently for our setting. We demonstrate the
validity of our framework on simulated data. To illustrate, we apply our
machinery to data from an epidemiological cohort to detect and infer several
effects for high cholesterol and blood pressure, such as nonlinear interaction
effects between features like age, sex, ethnicity, BMI and glucose level.

approximate fairness measures, including mean difference and mean ratio. We
show that these approximate measures for existing group fairness notions,
including Demographic Parity, Equal Opportunity, Predictive Equality, and
Accuracy Parity, are linear transformations of selection rates for specific
groups defined by both labels and sensitive features. We then characterize that
Bayes-optimal fair classifiers for multiple sensitive features become
instance-dependent thresholding rules that rely on a weighted sum of these
group membership probabilities. Our framework applies to both attribute-aware
and attribute-blind settings and can accommodate composite fairness notions
like Equalized Odds. Building on this, we propose two practical algorithms for
Bayes-optimal fair classification via in-processing and post-processing. We
show empirically that our methods compare favorably to existing methods.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for heterogeneous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
swarms to perform complex tasks in urban environments, system design now faces
major challenges, including efficient semantic understanding, flexible task
planning, and the ability to dynamically adjust coordination strategies in
response to evolving environmental conditions and continuously changing task
requirements. To address the limitations of existing approaches, this paper
proposes coordination field agentic system for coordinating heterogeneous UAV
swarms in complex urban scenarios. In this system, large language models (LLMs)
is responsible for interpreting high-level human instructions and converting
them into executable commands for the UAV swarms, such as patrol and target
tracking. Subsequently, a Coordination field mechanism is proposed to guide UAV
motion and task selection, enabling decentralized and adaptive allocation of
emergent tasks. A total of 50 rounds of comparative testing were conducted
across different models in a 2D simulation space to evaluate their performance.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves superior
performance in terms of task coverage, response time, and adaptability to
dynamic changes.

Abstract: The development of novel autonomous underwater gliders has been hindered by
limited shape diversity, primarily due to the reliance on traditional design
tools that depend heavily on manual trial and error. Building an automated
design framework is challenging due to the complexities of representing glider
shapes and the high computational costs associated with modeling complex
solid-fluid interactions. In this work, we introduce an AI-enhanced automated
computational framework designed to overcome these limitations by enabling the
creation of underwater robots with non-trivial hull shapes. Our approach
involves an algorithm that co-optimizes both shape and control signals,
utilizing a reduced-order geometry representation and a differentiable
neural-network-based fluid surrogate model. This end-to-end design workflow
facilitates rapid iteration and evaluation of hydrodynamic performance, leading
to the discovery of optimal and complex hull shapes across various control
settings. We validate our method through wind tunnel experiments and swimming
pool gliding tests, demonstrating that our computationally designed gliders
surpass manually designed counterparts in terms of energy efficiency. By
addressing challenges in efficient shape representation and neural fluid
surrogate models, our work paves the way for the development of highly
efficient underwater gliders, with implications for long-range ocean
exploration and environmental monitoring.

Abstract: Recently, natural language has been the primary medium for human-robot
interaction. However, its inherent lack of spatial precision for robotic
control introduces challenges such as ambiguity and verbosity. To address these
limitations, we introduce the Robotic Visual Instruction (RoVI), a novel
paradigm to guide robotic tasks through an object-centric, hand-drawn symbolic
representation. RoVI effectively encodes spatial-temporal information into
human-interpretable visual instructions through 2D sketches, utilizing arrows,
circles, colors, and numbers to direct 3D robotic manipulation. To enable
robots to understand RoVI better and generate precise actions based on RoVI, we
present Visual Instruction Embodied Workflow (VIEW), a pipeline formulated for
RoVI-conditioned policies. This approach leverages Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to interpret RoVI inputs, decode spatial and temporal constraints from
2D pixel space via keypoint extraction, and then transform them into executable
3D action sequences. We additionally curate a specialized dataset of 15K
instances to fine-tune small VLMs for edge deployment, enabling them to
effectively learn RoVI capabilities. Our approach is rigorously validated
across 11 novel tasks in both real and simulated environments, demonstrating
significant generalization capability. Notably, VIEW achieves an 87.5% success
rate in real-world scenarios involving unseen tasks that feature multi-step
actions, with disturbances, and trajectory-following requirements. Code and
Datasets in this paper will be released soon.

Abstract: This paper introduces an AI-enabled, interaction-aware active safety analysis
framework that accounts for groupwise vehicle interactions. Specifically, the
framework employs a bicycle model-augmented with road gradient
considerations-to accurately capture vehicle dynamics. In parallel, a
hypergraph-based AI model is developed to predict probabilistic trajectories of
ambient traffic. By integrating these two components, the framework derives
vehicle intra-spacing over a 3D road surface as the solution of a stochastic
ordinary differential equation, yielding high-fidelity surrogate safety
measures such as time-to-collision (TTC). To demonstrate its effectiveness, the
framework is analyzed using stochastic numerical methods comprising 4th-order
Runge-Kutta integration and AI inference, generating probability-weighted
high-fidelity TTC (HF-TTC) distributions that reflect complex multi-agent
maneuvers and behavioral uncertainties. Evaluated with HF-TTC against
traditional constant-velocity TTC and non-interaction-aware approaches on
highway datasets, the proposed framework offers a systematic methodology for
active safety analysis with enhanced potential for improving safety perception
in complex traffic environments.

Conclusion: 集成方法有效提升移动机器人在动态环境中的导航能力。

Abstract: This paper proposes an integrated approach for the safe and efficient control
of mobile robots in dynamic and uncertain environments. The approach consists
of two key steps: one-shot multimodal motion prediction to anticipate motions
of dynamic obstacles and model predictive control to incorporate these
predictions into the motion planning process. Motion prediction is driven by an
energy-based neural network that generates high-resolution, multi-step
predictions in a single operation. The prediction outcomes are further utilized
to create geometric shapes formulated as mathematical constraints. Instead of
treating each dynamic obstacle individually, predicted obstacles are grouped by
proximity in an unsupervised way to improve performance and efficiency. The
overall collision-free navigation is handled by model predictive control with a
specific design for proactive dynamic obstacle avoidance. The proposed approach
allows mobile robots to navigate effectively in dynamic environments. Its
performance is accessed across various scenarios that represent typical
warehouse settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms other existing dynamic obstacle avoidance methods.

Result: 在仿真和真实硬件实验中，自适应控制器在多种地形和负载变化下均表现优于基准控制器。

Conclusion: 自适应框架显著提升了四足机器人在复杂环境中的鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Quadrupedal robots are increasingly deployed for load-carrying tasks across
diverse terrains. While Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based methods can
account for payload variations, they often depend on predefined gait schedules
or trajectory generators, limiting their adaptability in unstructured
environments. To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive
Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that enables quadrupedal robots to
dynamically adapt to both varying payloads and diverse terrains. The framework
consists of a nominal policy responsible for baseline locomotion and an
adaptive policy that learns corrective actions to preserve stability and
improve command tracking under payload variations. We validate the proposed
approach through large-scale simulation experiments in Isaac Gym and real-world
hardware deployment on a Unitree Go1 quadruped. The controller was tested on
flat ground, slopes, and stairs under both static and dynamic payload changes.
Across all settings, our adaptive controller consistently outperformed the
controller in tracking body height and velocity commands, demonstrating
enhanced robustness and adaptability without requiring explicit gait design or
manual tuning.

Result: 在Cityscapes和Camvid数据集上，FedEMA的mIoU比现有方法高7.12%。

Conclusion: FedEMA通过双目标优化，有效平衡了模型的泛化性和适应性，解决了时间灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Street Scene Semantic Understanding (denoted as S3U) is a crucial but complex
task for autonomous driving (AD) vehicles. Their inference models typically
face poor generalization due to domain-shift. Federated Learning (FL) has
emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing the generalization of AD models
through privacy-preserving distributed learning. However, these FL AD models
face significant temporal catastrophic forgetting when deployed in dynamically
evolving environments, where continuous adaptation causes abrupt erosion of
historical knowledge. This paper proposes Federated Exponential Moving Average
(FedEMA), a novel framework that addresses this challenge through two integral
innovations: (I) Server-side model's historical fitting capability preservation
via fusing current FL round's aggregation model and a proposed previous FL
round's exponential moving average (EMA) model; (II) Vehicle-side negative
entropy regularization to prevent FL models' possible overfitting to
EMA-introduced temporal patterns. Above two strategies empower FedEMA a
dual-objective optimization that balances model generalization and
adaptability. In addition, we conduct theoretical convergence analysis for the
proposed FedEMA. Extensive experiments both on Cityscapes dataset and Camvid
dataset demonstrate FedEMA's superiority over existing approaches, showing
7.12% higher mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU).

Motivation: 协作机器人需持续适应新任务和用户偏好，但现有方法多限于单任务场景，不适合持续多任务协作。

Method: 将COIL建模为无容量限制设施选址问题（UFL），处理已知用户偏好；引入一步信念空间规划处理偏好不确定性。

Result: 模拟和物理实验表明，COIL显著减少人类工作量，同时确保任务成功完成。

Conclusion: COIL为多任务协作提供高效交互规划，平衡人类努力与任务成功。

Abstract: Collaborative robots must continually adapt to novel tasks and user
preferences without overburdening the user. While prior interactive robot
learning methods aim to reduce human effort, they are typically limited to
single-task scenarios and are not well-suited for sustained, multi-task
collaboration. We propose COIL (Cost-Optimal Interactive Learning) -- a
multi-task interaction planner that minimizes human effort across a sequence of
tasks by strategically selecting among three query types (skill, preference,
and help). When user preferences are known, we formulate COIL as an
uncapacitated facility location (UFL) problem, which enables bounded-suboptimal
planning in polynomial time using off-the-shelf approximation algorithms. We
extend our formulation to handle uncertainty in user preferences by
incorporating one-step belief space planning, which uses these approximation
algorithms as subroutines to maintain polynomial-time performance. Simulated
and physical experiments on manipulation tasks show that our framework
significantly reduces the amount of work allocated to the human while
maintaining successful task completion.

Conclusion: 该方法为安全关键场景模拟提供了有效工具，有助于更稳健的自动驾驶系统评估。

Abstract: Safety-critical traffic simulation plays a crucial role in evaluating
autonomous driving systems under rare and challenging scenarios. However,
existing approaches often generate unrealistic scenarios due to insufficient
consideration of physical plausibility and suffer from low generation
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a guided latent diffusion
model (LDM) capable of generating physically realistic and adversarial
safety-critical traffic scenarios. Specifically, our model employs a
graph-based variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn a compact latent space that
captures complex multi-agent interactions while improving computational
efficiency. Within this latent space, the diffusion model performs the
denoising process to produce realistic trajectories. To enable controllable and
adversarial scenario generation, we introduce novel guidance objectives that
drive the diffusion process toward producing adversarial and behaviorally
realistic driving behaviors. Furthermore, we develop a sample selection module
based on physical feasibility checks to further enhance the physical
plausibility of the generated scenarios. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes
dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior adversarial effectiveness
and generation efficiency compared to existing baselines while maintaining a
high level of realism. Our work provides an effective tool for realistic
safety-critical scenario simulation, paving the way for more robust evaluation
of autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: INR-DOM通过隐式表示和强化学习的结合，成功解决了弹性变形物体在部分观测下的操纵问题。

Abstract: We aim to solve the problem of manipulating deformable objects, particularly
elastic bands, in real-world scenarios. However, deformable object manipulation
(DOM) requires a policy that works on a large state space due to the unlimited
degree of freedom (DoF) of deformable objects. Further, their dense but partial
observations (e.g., images or point clouds) may increase the sampling
complexity and uncertainty in policy learning. To figure it out, we propose a
novel implicit neural-representation (INR) learning for elastic DOMs, called
INR-DOM. Our method learns consistent state representations associated with
partially observable elastic objects reconstructing a complete and implicit
surface represented as a signed distance function. Furthermore, we perform
exploratory representation fine-tuning through reinforcement learning (RL) that
enables RL algorithms to effectively learn exploitable representations while
efficiently obtaining a DOM policy. We perform quantitative and qualitative
analyses building three simulated environments and real-world manipulation
studies with a Franka Emika Panda arm. Videos are available at

Abstract: Learning to solve complex tasks with signal temporal logic (STL)
specifications is crucial to many real-world applications. However, most
previous works only consider fixed or parametrized STL specifications due to
the lack of a diverse STL dataset and encoders to effectively extract temporal
logic information for downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose TeLoGraF,
Temporal Logic Graph-encoded Flow, which utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNN)
encoder and flow-matching to learn solutions for general STL specifications. We
identify four commonly used STL templates and collect a total of 200K
specifications with paired demonstrations. We conduct extensive experiments in
five simulation environments ranging from simple dynamical models in the 2D
space to high-dimensional 7DoF Franka Panda robot arm and Ant quadruped
navigation. Results show that our method outperforms other baselines in the STL
satisfaction rate. Compared to classical STL planning algorithms, our approach
is 10-100X faster in inference and can work on any system dynamics. Besides, we
show our graph-encoding method's capability to solve complex STLs and
robustness to out-distribution STL specifications. Code is available at

Abstract: Automated parking is a critical feature of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems
(ADAS), where accurate trajectory prediction is essential to bridge perception
and planning modules. Despite its significance, research in this domain remains
relatively limited, with most existing studies concentrating on single-modal
trajectory prediction of vehicles. In this work, we propose ParkDiffusion, a
novel approach that predicts the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians
in automated parking scenarios. ParkDiffusion employs diffusion models to
capture the inherent uncertainty and multi-modality of future trajectories,
incorporating several key innovations. First, we propose a dual map encoder
that processes soft semantic cues and hard geometric constraints using a
two-step cross-attention mechanism. Second, we introduce an adaptive agent type
embedding module, which dynamically conditions the prediction process on the
distinct characteristics of vehicles and pedestrians. Third, to ensure
kinematic feasibility, our model outputs control signals that are subsequently
used within a kinematic framework to generate physically feasible trajectories.
We evaluate ParkDiffusion on the Dragon Lake Parking (DLP) dataset and the
Intersections Drone (inD) dataset. Our work establishes a new baseline for
heterogeneous trajectory prediction in parking scenarios, outperforming
existing methods by a considerable margin.

Abstract: As machine learning is increasingly deployed in autonomous systems,
verification of neural network controllers is becoming an active research
domain. Existing tools and annual verification competitions suggest that soon
this technology will become effective for real-world applications. Our
application comes from the emerging field of microflyers that are passively
transported by the wind, which may have various uses in weather or pollution
monitoring. Specifically, we investigate centimetre-scale bio-inspired gliding
drones that resemble Alsomitra macrocarpa diaspores. In this paper, we propose
a new case study on verifying Alsomitra-inspired drones with neural network
controllers, with the aim of adhering closely to a target trajectory. We show
that our system differs substantially from existing VNN and ARCH competition
benchmarks, and show that a combination of tools holds promise for verifying
such systems in the future, if certain shortcomings can be overcome. We propose
a novel method for robust training of regression networks, and investigate
formalisations of this case study in Vehicle and CORA. Our verification results
suggest that the investigated training methods do improve performance and
robustness of neural network controllers in this application, but are limited
in scope and usefulness. This is due to systematic limitations of both Vehicle
and CORA, and the complexity of our system reducing the scale of reachability,
which we investigate in detail. If these limitations can be overcome, it will
enable engineers to develop safe and robust technologies that improve people's
lives and reduce our impact on the environment.

### [240] [Neuroevolution of Self-Attention Over Proto-Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00186)
*Rafael C. Pinto,Anderson R. Tavares*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于原型对象的注意力机制，替代传统的矩形图像块，显著降低了表示复杂性和训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于矩形块的注意力机制在视觉强化学习中表现优异，但存在表示复杂性和效率问题。

Method: 利用图像分割生成原型对象，将其编码为紧凑特征向量，构建更小的自注意力模块。

Result: 实验表明，该方法性能与现有技术相当或更优，参数减少62%，训练时间缩短2.6倍。

Conclusion: 原型对象方法在减少计算资源的同时，提升了语义信息的处理效率。

Abstract: Proto-objects - image regions that share common visual properties - offer a
promising alternative to traditional attention mechanisms based on
rectangular-shaped image patches in neural networks. Although previous work
demonstrated that evolving a patch-based hard-attention module alongside a
controller network could achieve state-of-the-art performance in visual
reinforcement learning tasks, our approach leverages image segmentation to work
with higher-level features. By operating on proto-objects rather than fixed
patches, we significantly reduce the representational complexity: each image
decomposes into fewer proto-objects than regular patches, and each proto-object
can be efficiently encoded as a compact feature vector. This enables a
substantially smaller self-attention module that processes richer semantic
information. Our experiments demonstrate that this proto-object-based approach
matches or exceeds the state-of-the-art performance of patch-based
implementations with 62% less parameters and 2.6 times less training time.

### [242] [An Inversion Theorem for Buffered Linear Toeplitz (BLT) Matrices and Applications to Streaming Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21413)
*H. Brendan McMahan,Krishna Pillutla*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: BLT矩阵的逆矩阵仍是BLT矩阵，且参数不同；提出高效可微的O(d³)算法计算逆矩阵参数，支持隐私机制优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BLT矩阵在流式差分隐私中起重要作用，但对其逆矩阵的研究不足。

Method: 提出BLT逆矩阵定理，并设计O(d³)算法计算逆矩阵参数。

Result: 证明BLT逆矩阵仍为BLT矩阵，算法高效且可微。

Conclusion: 该研究为隐私机制的直接优化提供了新工具。

Abstract: Buffered Linear Toeplitz (BLT) matrices are a family of parameterized
lower-triangular matrices that play an important role in streaming differential
privacy with correlated noise. Our main result is a BLT inversion theorem: the
inverse of a BLT matrix is itself a BLT matrix with different parameters. We
also present an efficient and differentiable $O(d^3)$ algorithm to compute the
parameters of the inverse BLT matrix, where $d$ is the degree of the original
BLT (typically $d < 10$). Our characterization enables direct optimization of
BLT parameters for privacy mechanisms through automatic differentiation.

### [243] [Analysis of the vulnerability of machine learning regression models to adversarial attacks using data from 5G wireless networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00487)
*Leonid Legashev,Artur Zhigalov,Denis Parfenov*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文介绍了使用DeepMIMO模拟器创建脚本并分析数据集的过程，通过FGSM方法进行对抗攻击以最大化梯度，比较了二进制分类器在检测失真数据任务中的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究对抗攻击对回归模型的影响，以及如何有效检测对抗性异常数据。

Method: 使用FGSM方法进行对抗攻击，比较二进制分类器（如LightGBM）的性能，并分析回归模型在不同条件下的质量指标变化。

Result: FGSM攻击使MSE增加33%，R2下降10%；LightGBM分类器检测对抗性异常的准确率达98%。

Conclusion: 回归模型易受对抗攻击，但快速分析网络流量和数据可有效识别恶意活动。

Abstract: This article describes the process of creating a script and conducting an
analytical study of a dataset using the DeepMIMO emulator. An advertorial
attack was carried out using the FGSM method to maximize the gradient. A
comparison is made of the effectiveness of binary classifiers in the task of
detecting distorted data. The dynamics of changes in the quality indicators of
the regression model were analyzed in conditions without adversarial attacks,
during an adversarial attack and when the distorted data was isolated. It is
shown that an adversarial FGSM attack with gradient maximization leads to an
increase in the value of the MSE metric by 33% and a decrease in the R2
indicator by 10% on average. The LightGBM binary classifier effectively
identifies data with adversarial anomalies with 98% accuracy. Regression
machine learning models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, but rapid
analysis of network traffic and data transmitted over the network makes it
possible to identify malicious activity

### [244] [Optimization of embeddings storage for RAG systems using quantization and dimensionality reduction techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00105)
*Naamán Huerga-Pérez,Rubén Álvarez,Rubén Ferrero-Guillén,Alberto Martínez-Gutiérrez,Javier Díez-González*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文研究了通过量化和降维优化检索增强生成模型的存储问题，发现float8量化和PCA结合是最佳方案，实现了8倍压缩且性能损失最小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维向量嵌入在存储上的内存挑战，提升检索增强生成模型的实用性。

Method: 系统评估了量化（float16、int8、binary、float8）和降维（PCA、Kernel PCA、UMAP、Random Projections、Autoencoders）策略。

Result: float8量化实现4倍存储压缩且性能损失<0.3%，结合50%维度的PCA可达到8倍压缩。

Conclusion: float8量化和PCA结合是最优方案，并提出可视化方法帮助选择最佳配置。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation enhances language models by retrieving
relevant information from external knowledge bases, relying on high-dimensional
vector embeddings typically stored in float32 precision. However, storing these
embeddings at scale presents significant memory challenges. To address this
issue, we systematically investigate on MTEB benchmark two complementary
optimization strategies: quantization, evaluating standard formats (float16,
int8, binary) and low-bit floating-point types (float8), and dimensionality
reduction, assessing methods like PCA, Kernel PCA, UMAP, Random Projections and
Autoencoders. Our results show that float8 quantization achieves a 4x storage
reduction with minimal performance degradation (<0.3%), significantly
outperforming int8 quantization at the same compression level, being simpler to
implement. PCA emerges as the most effective dimensionality reduction
technique. Crucially, combining moderate PCA (e.g., retaining 50% dimensions)
with float8 quantization offers an excellent trade-off, achieving 8x total
compression with less performance impact than using int8 alone (which provides
only 4x compression). To facilitate practical application, we propose a
methodology based on visualizing the performance-storage trade-off space to
identify the optimal configuration that maximizes performance within their
specific memory constraints.

*Michael J. Ryan,Danmei Xu,Chris Nivera,Daniel Campos*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文介绍了EnronQA基准测试，用于改进基于私有数据的RAG管道评估，填补了现有公共数据基准的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG基准主要依赖公共数据，缺乏对私有和个人化数据的支持，限制了RAG在隐私敏感场景的应用。

Method: 通过构建EnronQA数据集（包含103,638封邮件和528,304个问答对），为私有数据RAG提供评估工具。

Result: EnronQA支持私有数据RAG的优化和个性化检索实验，并探讨了记忆与检索的权衡。

Conclusion: EnronQA为私有数据RAG提供了更真实的评估环境，推动了隐私敏感场景的技术发展。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has become one of the most popular
methods for bringing knowledge-intensive context to large language models (LLM)
because of its ability to bring local context at inference time without the
cost or data leakage risks associated with fine-tuning. A clear separation of
private information from the LLM training has made RAG the basis for many
enterprise LLM workloads as it allows the company to augment LLM's
understanding using customers' private documents. Despite its popularity for
private documents in enterprise deployments, current RAG benchmarks for
validating and optimizing RAG pipelines draw their corpora from public data
such as Wikipedia or generic web pages and offer little to no personal context.
Seeking to empower more personal and private RAG we release the EnronQA
benchmark, a dataset of 103,638 emails with 528,304 question-answer pairs
across 150 different user inboxes. EnronQA enables better benchmarking of RAG
pipelines over private data and allows for experimentation on the introduction
of personalized retrieval settings over realistic data. Finally, we use EnronQA
to explore the tradeoff in memorization and retrieval when reasoning over
private documents.

### [246] [Investigating Task Arithmetic for Zero-Shot Information Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00649)

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Task Arithmetic的技术，通过简单的数学运算（如加减）结合不同任务或领域的预训练LLM权重，无需额外微调即可适应检索任务，显著提升了零样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在零样本任务中表现优异，但在未见过的任务和领域中性能下降，主要由于词汇和词分布的变化。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用Task Arithmetic技术，通过数学运算结合不同任务或领域的预训练LLM权重，合成多样化的任务和领域知识到一个模型中。

Result: 在公开的科学、生物医学和多语言数据集上，该方法将NDCG@10和P@10分别提升了18%和15%。

Conclusion: Task Arithmetic是一种有效的零样本学习和模型适应策略，同时论文还分析了其优势和局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive zero-shot performance
across a variety of Natural Language Processing tasks, including document
re-ranking. However, their effectiveness degrades on unseen tasks and domains,
largely due to shifts in vocabulary and word distributions. In this paper, we
investigate Task Arithmetic, a technique that combines the weights of LLMs
pre-trained on different tasks or domains via simple mathematical operations,
such as addition or subtraction, to adapt retrieval models without requiring
additional fine-tuning. Our method is able to synthesize diverse tasks and
domain knowledge into a single model, enabling effective zero-shot adaptation
in different retrieval contexts. Extensive experiments on publicly available
scientific, biomedical, and multilingual datasets show that our method improves
state-of-the-art re-ranking performance by up to 18% in NDCG@10 and 15% in
P@10. In addition to these empirical gains, our analysis provides insights into
the strengths and limitations of Task Arithmetic as a practical strategy for
zero-shot learning and model adaptation. We make our code publicly available at
https://github.com/DetectiveMB/Task-Arithmetic-for-ZS-IR.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出ChebyCF框架，通过图谱滤波解决图卷积网络在协同过滤中的局限性，利用用户原始交互历史和Chebyshev插值实现高效推荐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图卷积网络在协同过滤中因嵌入层和邻域聚合的局限性，无法充分利用局部偏好模式和多样化偏好。

Method: 采用图谱滤波技术，直接利用用户原始交互历史，结合Chebyshev插值和理想通滤波器增强非线性滤波能力。

Result: 实验表明ChebyCF在多基准测试中表现优异，推理速度快。

Conclusion: ChebyCF有效解决了现有方法的瓶颈，实现了先进的推荐性能。

Abstract: Graph convolutional networks have recently gained prominence in collaborative
filtering (CF) for recommendations. However, we identify potential bottlenecks
in two foundational components. First, the embedding layer leads to a latent
space with limited capacity, overlooking locally observed but potentially
valuable preference patterns. Also, the widely-used neighborhood aggregation is
limited in its ability to leverage diverse preference patterns in a
fine-grained manner. Building on spectral graph theory, we reveal that these
limitations stem from graph filtering with a cut-off in the frequency spectrum
and a restricted linear form. To address these issues, we introduce ChebyCF, a
CF framework based on graph spectral filtering. Instead of a learned embedding,
it takes a user's raw interaction history to utilize the full spectrum of
signals contained in it. Also, it adopts Chebyshev interpolation to effectively
approximate a flexible non-linear graph filter, and further enhances it by
using an additional ideal pass filter and degree-based normalization. Through
extensive experiments, we verify that ChebyCF overcomes the aforementioned
bottlenecks and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple
benchmarks and reasonably fast inference. Our code is available at
https://github.com/chanwoo0806/ChebyCF.
