### [1] [MedBench-IT: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models on Italian Medical Entrance Examinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07135)
*Ruggero Marino Lazzaroni,Alessandro Angioi,Michelangelo Puliga,Davide Sanna,Roberto Marras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedBench-IT是首个针对意大利医学入学考试的综合性基准测试，包含17,410道多选题，涵盖6个学科和3个难度级别，用于评估LLM在意大利语医学教育领域的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏针对非英语语言在专业领域的LLM基准测试，特别是在意大利语医学教育领域，需要建立标准化的评估体系。

Method: 从Edizioni Simone获取专家编写的多选题，构建包含6个学科（生物、化学、逻辑等）的数据集，评估包括GPT-4o、Claude系列和高效开源模型在内的多种LLM。

Result: 模型表现良好，响应一致性达88.86%（因学科而异），排序偏差影响小，发现题目可读性与模型性能存在统计显著但较小的负相关关系。

Conclusion: MedBench-IT为意大利NLP社区、教育技术开发者和从业者提供了重要资源，揭示了当前LLM在该关键领域的能力，并提供了标准化评估方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show increasing potential in education, yet
benchmarks for non-English languages in specialized domains remain scarce. We
introduce MedBench-IT, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs on
Italian medical university entrance examinations. Sourced from Edizioni Simone,
a leading preparatory materials publisher, MedBench-IT comprises 17,410
expert-written multiple-choice questions across six subjects (Biology,
Chemistry, Logic, General Culture, Mathematics, Physics) and three difficulty
levels. We evaluated diverse models including proprietary LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude
series) and resource-efficient open-source alternatives (<30B parameters)
focusing on practical deployability.
  Beyond accuracy, we conducted rigorous reproducibility tests (88.86% response
consistency, varying by subject), ordering bias analysis (minimal impact), and
reasoning prompt evaluation. We also examined correlations between question
readability and model performance, finding a statistically significant but
small inverse relationship. MedBench-IT provides a crucial resource for Italian
NLP community, EdTech developers, and practitioners, offering insights into
current capabilities and standardized evaluation methodology for this critical
domain.

### [3] [Toward Purpose-oriented Topic Model Evaluation enabled by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07142)
*Zhiyin Tan,Jennifer D'Souza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个使用大型语言模型自动评估动态演化主题模型的框架，包含9个基于LLM的指标来评估主题质量的四个关键维度，相比传统指标能更好地发现语义缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题模型评估指标（如连贯性和多样性）只能捕捉狭窄的统计模式，无法解释实际应用中的语义失败，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 开发了基于LLM的目的导向评估框架，包含9个指标评估词汇有效性、主题内语义合理性、主题间结构合理性和文档-主题对齐合理性四个维度，通过对抗性和采样协议验证。

Result: LLM-based指标提供了可解释、稳健且任务相关的评估，能够发现传统指标常忽略的主题模型关键弱点，如冗余和语义漂移。

Conclusion: 该框架支持开发可扩展的细粒度评估工具，用于维护动态数据集中的主题相关性，所有代码和数据均已开源。

Abstract: This study presents a framework for automated evaluation of dynamically
evolving topic models using Large Language Models (LLMs). Topic modeling is
essential for organizing and retrieving scholarly content in digital library
systems, helping users navigate complex and evolving knowledge domains.
However, widely used automated metrics, such as coherence and diversity, often
capture only narrow statistical patterns and fail to explain semantic failures
in practice. We introduce a purpose-oriented evaluation framework that employs
nine LLM-based metrics spanning four key dimensions of topic quality: lexical
validity, intra-topic semantic soundness, inter-topic structural soundness, and
document-topic alignment soundness. The framework is validated through
adversarial and sampling-based protocols, and is applied across datasets
spanning news articles, scholarly publications, and social media posts, as well
as multiple topic modeling methods and open-source LLMs. Our analysis shows
that LLM-based metrics provide interpretable, robust, and task-relevant
assessments, uncovering critical weaknesses in topic models such as redundancy
and semantic drift, which are often missed by traditional metrics. These
results support the development of scalable, fine-grained evaluation tools for
maintaining topic relevance in dynamic datasets. All code and data supporting
this work are accessible at

### [4] [Towards EnergyGPT: A Large Language Model Specialized for the Energy Sector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07177)
*Amal Chebbi,Babajide Kolade*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EnergyGPT是基于LLaMA 3.1-8B微调的专业能源领域语言模型，在能源相关任务上表现优于基础模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大模型在能源等专业领域效果有限，需要深度技术知识和精确领域专业知识

Method: 使用监督微调方法，在高质量能源文本语料上微调LLaMA 3.1-8B模型，包括数据收集、模型微调、基准设计等完整开发流程

Result: EnergyGPT在大多数能源相关语言理解和生成任务上优于基础模型，证明了训练策略的有效性

Conclusion: 通过领域专业化微调，可以在不需要大规模基础设施的情况下提升模型在特定领域的相关性和性能

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
various domains. However, their general-purpose nature often limits their
effectiveness in specialized fields such as energy, where deep technical
expertise and precise domain knowledge are essential. In this paper, we
introduce EnergyGPT, a domain-specialized language model tailored for the
energy sector, developed by fine-tuning LLaMA 3.1-8B model using Supervised
Fine-Tuning on a high-quality, curated corpus of energy-related texts. We
present a complete development pipeline, including data collection and
curation, model fine-tuning, benchmark design and LLM-judge choice, evaluation
and deployment. Through this work, we demonstrate that our training strategy
enables improvements in domain relevance and performance without the need for
large-scale infrastructure. By evaluating the performance of the model using
domain-specific question-answering benchmarks, our results demonstrate that
EnergyGPT outperforms the base model in most of the energy-related language
understanding and generation tasks.

### [5] [DischargeSim: A Simulation Benchmark for Educational Doctor-Patient Communication at Discharge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07188)
*Zonghai Yao,Michael Sun,Won Seok Jang,Sunjae Kwon,Soie Kwon,Hong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DischargeSim是一个评估大语言模型在出院沟通中作为个性化教育者能力的新基准，通过模拟医患对话来测试模型在六个临床主题上的表现，发现模型能力存在显著差异且模型大小不总是带来更好效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM基准主要关注诊断推理，但忽视了出院后患者教育这一关键环节，需要评估模型在出院沟通中的个性化教育能力

Method: 创建DischargeSim基准，模拟多轮医患对话，使用不同心理社会特征的患者代理，通过自动评估、LLM作为评判者、个性化文档生成和患者理解测试来评估模型

Result: 测试18个LLM显示出院教育能力存在显著差距，性能因患者特征而异，模型大小不总是带来更好的教育效果

Conclusion: DischargeSim为评估LLM在临床后访教育中的表现提供了首个基准，有助于促进公平、个性化的患者支持

Abstract: Discharge communication is a critical yet underexplored component of patient
care, where the goal shifts from diagnosis to education. While recent large
language model (LLM) benchmarks emphasize in-visit diagnostic reasoning, they
fail to evaluate models' ability to support patients after the visit. We
introduce DischargeSim, a novel benchmark that evaluates LLMs on their ability
to act as personalized discharge educators. DischargeSim simulates post-visit,
multi-turn conversations between LLM-driven DoctorAgents and PatientAgents with
diverse psychosocial profiles (e.g., health literacy, education, emotion).
Interactions are structured across six clinically grounded discharge topics and
assessed along three axes: (1) dialogue quality via automatic and LLM-as-judge
evaluation, (2) personalized document generation including free-text summaries
and structured AHRQ checklists, and (3) patient comprehension through a
downstream multiple-choice exam. Experiments across 18 LLMs reveal significant
gaps in discharge education capability, with performance varying widely across
patient profiles. Notably, model size does not always yield better education
outcomes, highlighting trade-offs in strategy use and content prioritization.
DischargeSim offers a first step toward benchmarking LLMs in post-visit
clinical education and promoting equitable, personalized patient support.

### [6] [Rule-Based Moral Principles for Explaining Uncertainty in Natural Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07190)
*Zahra Atf,Peter R Lewis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 基于道德原则的框架，通过规则引擎处理LLM不确定性，提供透明的说明和理由


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概率方法不透明且与透明性期望不一致，需要在高风险场景中提供可解释的不确定性处理方案

Method: 基于道德心理学和美德伦理学，定义预防、尊重、责任等规则，用Prolog引擎编码，根据不确定性级别触发对应动作

Result: 通过场景模拟测试规则覆盖率、公平性和信任检验，在临床和法律领域实例证明能提升信任和可解释性

Conclusion: 该方法为社会责任致的自然语言生成提供了轻量级、透明的概率模型替代方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes settings,
where explaining uncertainty is both technical and ethical. Probabilistic
methods are often opaque and misaligned with expectations of transparency. We
propose a framework based on rule-based moral principles for handling
uncertainty in LLM-generated text. Using insights from moral psychology and
virtue ethics, we define rules such as precaution, deference, and
responsibility to guide responses under epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty.
These rules are encoded in a lightweight Prolog engine, where uncertainty
levels (low, medium, high) trigger aligned system actions with plain-language
rationales. Scenario-based simulations benchmark rule coverage, fairness, and
trust calibration. Use cases in clinical and legal domains illustrate how moral
reasoning can improve trust and interpretability. Our approach offers a
transparent, lightweight alternative to probabilistic models for socially
responsible natural language generation.

### [7] [LLM Analysis of 150+ years of German Parliamentary Debates on Migration Reveals Shift from Post-War Solidarity to Anti-Solidarity in the Last Decade](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07274)
*Aida Kostikova,Ole Pütz,Steffen Eger,Olga Sabelfeld,Benjamin Paassen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用大型语言模型自动标注德国议会辩论中的（反）团结子类型，评估不同模型和方法的性能，并分析二战后至今德国移民政策辩论中的团结趋势变化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工标注方法限制了大规模政治文本分析的深度和广度，需要探索LLM在复杂政治文本标注任务中的自动化潜力，以深入研究德国移民政策辩论的历史演变

Method: 评估多种LLM模型（不同规模、提示策略、微调效果）在标注德国议会辩论中（反）团结子类型的性能，与数千个人工参考标注进行比较，分析历史与现代数据的差异

Result: LLM在复杂政治文本标注任务中表现出色，数据揭示战后时期高度移民导向的团结，以及2015年以来德国议会中强烈的反团结趋势

Conclusion: LLM为政治文本分析提供了巨大潜力，德国移民辩论在人口衰退和劳动力短缺背景下呈现日益两极分化的特点，需要进一步研究

Abstract: Migration has been a core topic in German political debate, from millions of
expellees post World War II over labor migration to refugee movements in the
recent past. Studying political speech regarding such wide-ranging phenomena in
depth traditionally required extensive manual annotations, limiting the scope
of analysis to small subsets of the data. Large language models (LLMs) have the
potential to partially automate even complex annotation tasks. We provide an
extensive evaluation of a multiple LLMs in annotating (anti-)solidarity
subtypes in German parliamentary debates compared to a large set of thousands
of human reference annotations (gathered over a year). We evaluate the
influence of model size, prompting differences, fine-tuning, historical versus
contemporary data; and we investigate systematic errors. Beyond methodological
evaluation, we also interpret the resulting annotations from a social science
lense, gaining deeper insight into (anti-)solidarity trends towards migrants in
the German post-World War II period and recent past. Our data reveals a high
degree of migrant-directed solidarity in the postwar period, as well as a
strong trend towards anti-solidarity in the German parliament since 2015,
motivating further research. These findings highlight the promise of LLMs for
political text analysis and the importance of migration debates in Germany,
where demographic decline and labor shortages coexist with rising polarization.

### [8] [Causal Attention with Lookahead Keys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07301)
*Zhuoqing Song,Peng Sun,Huizhuo Yuan,Quanquan Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CASTLE是一种新颖的注意力机制，通过动态更新每个token的键值来整合后续信息，同时保持自回归特性，在语言建模任务中表现优于标准因果注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准因果注意力中每个token的QKV是静态的，只能编码前文信息，限制了模型对完整上下文的理解能力。

Method: 提出CASTLE机制，持续更新每个token的键值（称为lookahead keys），使其能够整合后续位置的信息，同时保持自回归特性。通过数学等价性实现高效并行训练。

Result: 在语言建模基准测试中，CASTLE在不同规模的模型上都优于标准因果注意力，降低了验证困惑度，并在多个下游任务上提升了性能。

Conclusion: 动态更新键值的注意力机制能够有效提升语言模型性能，为改进注意力机制提供了新的方向。

Abstract: In standard causal attention, each token's query, key, and value (QKV) are
static and encode only preceding context. We introduce CAuSal aTtention with
Lookahead kEys (CASTLE), an attention mechanism that continually updates each
token's keys as the context unfolds. We term these updated keys lookahead keys
because they belong to earlier positions yet integrate information from tokens
that appear later relative to those positions, while strictly preserving the
autoregressive property. Although the mechanism appears sequential, we derive a
mathematical equivalence that avoids explicitly materializing lookahead keys at
each position and enables efficient parallel training. On language modeling
benchmarks, CASTLE consistently outperforms standard causal attention across
model scales, reducing validation perplexity and improving performance on a
range of downstream tasks.

### [9] [Basis Vector Metric: A Method for Robust Open-Ended State Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07308)
*David Oprea,Sam Powers*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BVM方法在图像状态分类中表现最佳，但在形容词区分方面不如逻辑回归模型，但存在改进空间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试BVM方法在判断图像状态变化方面的能力，特别是在名词状态分类和形容词区分方面的表现

Method: 使用MIT-States数据集（53,000张图像，225个名词和115个形容词），通过语言嵌入进行状态判断。第一实验比较BVM与余弦相似度、点积、乘积量化等方法的性能；第二实验比较BVM与逻辑回归模型在形容词区分方面的能力

Result: BVM在名词状态分类方面表现最佳，但在形容词区分方面未能超越逻辑回归模型

Conclusion: BVM方法在名词状态分类上有优势，但在形容词区分方面需要进一步改进方法以提高准确性

Abstract: We test a new method, which we will abbreviate using the acronym BVM (Basis
Vectors Method), in its ability to judge the state changes in images through
using language embeddings. We used the MIT-States dataset, containing about
53,000 images, to gather all of our data, which has 225 nouns and 115
adjectives, with each noun having about 9 different adjectives, forming
approximately 1000 noun-adjective pairs. For our first experiment, we test our
method's ability to determine the state of each noun class separately against
other metrics for comparison. These metrics are cosine similarity, dot product,
product quantization, binary index, Naive Bayes, and a custom neural network.
Among these metrics, we found that our proposed BVM performs the best in
classifying the states for each noun. We then perform a second experiment where
we try using BVM to determine if it can differentiate adjectives from one
another for each adjective separately. We compared the abilities of BVM to
differentiate adjectives against the proposed method the MIT-States paper
suggests: using a logistic regression model. In the end, we did not find
conclusive evidence that our BVM metric could perform better than the logistic
regression model at discerning adjectives. Yet, we were able to find evidence
for possible improvements to our method; this leads to the chance of increasing
our method's accuracy through certain changes in our methodologies.

*Chi-Yang Hsu,Alexander Braylan,Yiheng Su,Omar Alonso,Matthew Lease*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 长文本生成任务的实例级性能预测新基准，通过黑盒输入输出预测多维评价指标的连续分数和不确定性区间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为长文本生成任务建立一个任务、模型和评量方法无关的性能预测基准，解决多维度、细粒度质量指标的预测问题

Method: 使用黑盒模型的输入和输出，预测连续的评价指标分数和不确定性区间，支持少量训练示例（例如16个）

Result: 在11个长文本数据集/任务上进行评估，证明可以通过少量训练示例有效预测不同任务的评分

Conclusion: 这是一个新颖且实用的任务，提供了价值较高的基准测试集和可直接应用的基线方法

Abstract: We motivate and share a new benchmark for instance-level performance
prediction of long-form generation tasks having multi-faceted, fine-grained
quality metrics. Our task-, model- and metric-agnostic formulation predicts
continuous evaluation metric scores given only black-box model inputs and
outputs. Beyond predicting point estimates of metric scores, the benchmark also
requires inferring prediction intervals to quantify uncertainty around point
estimates. Evaluation spans 11 long-form datasets/tasks with multiple LLMs,
baselines, and metrics per task. We show that scores can be effectively
predicted across long-form generation tasks using as few as 16 training
examples. Overall, we introduce a novel and useful task, a valuable benchmark
to drive progress, and baselines ready for practical adoption today.

### [11] [Does This Look Familiar to You? Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07311)
*Sihyun Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KAMIR是一种基于模型内部表示的数据选择方法，通过分析隐藏状态相似度来评估数据，无需提示工程即可选择对训练有益的数据


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SFT训练中数据选择方法依赖提示工程、成本高且适用范围有限的问题

Method: 通过计算模型各层隐藏状态与最终隐藏状态的相似度来评估数据熟悉度，选择模型不熟悉的数据进行训练

Result: 实验表明使用不熟悉数据训练能获得更好的泛化性能，适用于多种任务类型

Conclusion: KAMIR提供了一种有效且通用的数据选择方法，能提升模型性能同时降低训练成本

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have been driven by
pretraining, supervised fine tuning (SFT), and alignment tuning. Among these,
SFT plays a crucial role in transforming a model 's general knowledge into
structured responses tailored to specific tasks. However, there is no clearly
established methodology for effective training data selection. Simply
increasing the volume of data does not guarantee performance improvements,
while preprocessing, sampling, and validation require substantial time and
cost.
  To address this issue, a variety of data selection methods have been
proposed. Among them, knowledge based selection approaches identify suitable
training data by analyzing the model 's responses. Nevertheless, these methods
typically rely on prompt engineering, making them sensitive to variations and
incurring additional costs for prompt design.
  In this study, we propose Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal
Representations (KAMIR), a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by
analyzing data based on the model 's internal representations. KAMIR computes
similarities between the hidden states of each layer (block) and the final
hidden states for a given input to assess the data. Unlike prior methods that
were largely limited to multiple choice tasks, KAMIR can be applied to a wide
range of tasks such as machine reading comprehension and summarization.
Moreover, it selects data useful for training based on the model 's familiarity
with the input, even with a small dataset and a simple classifier architecture.
Experiments across diverse task datasets demonstrate that training with less
familiar data leads to better generalization performance.

*Nakyung Lee,Yeongoon Kim,Minhae Oh,Suhwan Kim,Jin Woo Koo,Hyewon Jo,Jungwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SAOBP框架解决Transformer自注意力机制中的局部化问题，通过信念传播注入多跳关系，引入GTD指标量化多跳连接贡献，在深层防止熵崩溃并提升小模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer自注意力机制存在局部化问题，注意力集中在有限token子集上，难以捕获长距离依赖关系

Method: 提出Self-Attention One-step Belief Propagation (SAOBP)框架，通过信念传播过程注入多跳关系，并引入Global Token Dependency (GTD)指标来量化和解释这些多跳交互

Result: SAOBP有助于防止深层网络中的熵崩溃，自适应地将GTD维持在任务适当水平，从而提升模型性能，特别是在小规模模型中表现出竞争优势

Conclusion: SAOBP框架有效解决了注意力局部化问题，改善了长距离依赖捕获能力，在资源受限场景下具有提升推理质量的潜力

Abstract: Transformer-based self-attention mechanism serves as the core of modern
language models, yet it often suffers from localization, where attentions
collapse onto a limited subset of tokens and fail to capture long-range
dependencies. To address this issue, we propose Self-Attention One-step Belief
Propagation (SAOBP), a refinement framework that injects multi-hop
relationships through a belief propagation process. To interpret and quantify
these interactions, we introduce Global Token Dependency (GTD) that captures
the relative contribution of multihop connections within the attention graph.
Empirical results indicate that SAOBP helps prevent entropy collapse in deeper
layers and adaptively maintains GTD at task-appropriate levels, thereby
supporting improvements in model performance. Importantly, we observe
competitive gains in small-scale models, highlighting its potential for
improving inference quality in resource-constrained scenarios.

*Yixuan Tang,Yi Yang,Ahmed Abbasi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PersonaFuse是一个新颖的LLM后训练框架，通过混合专家架构使大语言模型能够根据不同情境自适应表达不同个性，显著提升社交情感智能而不损害通用推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在真实对话中表现出情感感知和社交能力的局限性，无法根据不同社交和任务情境调整沟通风格和情感表达。

Method: 基于特质激活理论和Big Five人格模型，采用混合专家架构，结合个性适配器和动态路由网络，实现情境化特质表达。

Result: 在多个社交情感智能维度上显著优于基线模型，在下游人本应用（如心理健康咨询和客户服务）中表现一致提升，人类偏好评估显示与领先LLMs竞争性表现。

Conclusion: PersonaFuse提供了一个理论基础扎实且实用的方法，用于开发社交情感增强的大语言模型，标志着向更人本化AI系统的重要进展。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities across various fields. These developments have led to more direct
communication between humans and LLMs in various situations, such as social
companionship and psychological support. However, LLMs often exhibit
limitations in emotional perception and social competence during real-world
conversations. These limitations partly originate from their inability to adapt
their communication style and emotional expression to different social and task
contexts. In this work, we introduce PersonaFuse, a novel LLM post-training
framework that enables LLMs to adapt and express different personalities for
varying situations. Inspired by Trait Activation Theory and the Big Five
personality model, PersonaFuse employs a Mixture-of-Expert architecture that
combines persona adapters with a dynamic routing network, enabling contextual
trait expression. Experimental results show that PersonaFuse substantially
outperforms baseline models across multiple dimensions of social-emotional
intelligence. Importantly, these gains are achieved without sacrificing general
reasoning ability or model safety, which remain common limitations of direct
prompting and supervised fine-tuning approaches. PersonaFuse also delivers
consistent improvements in downstream human-centered applications, such as
mental health counseling and review-based customer service. Finally, human
preference evaluations against leading LLMs, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek,
demonstrate that PersonaFuse achieves competitive response quality despite its
comparatively smaller model size. These findings demonstrate that
PersonaFuse~offers a theoretically grounded and practical approach for
developing social-emotional enhanced LLMs, marking a significant advancement
toward more human-centric AI systems.

TL;DR: 大语言模型在通过交互反馈学习新语言方面失败，无法在100次回应内建立会话，但展现了类似人类语言学习的策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注语言能力的各个方面，但缺乏对LLM通过模式识别和交互反馈学习语言的评估，这是人类语言获取的核心特征。

Method: 提出了一种新的实验框架，让LLM模型与只理解新构造语言Tinkatongue的机器人进行会话，评估其学习和使用新语言的能力。

Result: LLM模型在100次回应内无法成功建立会话，但展现出了与人类语言学习相似的策略。

Conclusion: 结果指明需要新的评估标准和模型设计方向，以更有效地从交互反馈中学习。

Abstract: Existing evaluation studies on linguistic competence of large language models
(LLM agents) have focused primarily on vocabulary learning, morphological rule
induction, syntactic generalization, pragmatic inference, and cross-linguistic
transfer. However, none assess whether LLM agents can acquire a language
through pattern recognition and interactive feedback, a central feature of
human language acquisition. We propose a novel experimental framework in which
an LLM agent is evaluated on its ability to acquire and use a newly constructed
language (Tinkatongue) in conversation with a bot that understands only
Tinkatongue. Our findings show that LLM agents fail to establish a conversation
within 100 responses, yet they adopt distinct strategies that mirror human
approaches to language learning. The results suggest a new direction for
evaluation benchmarks and open pathways to model designs that learn more
effectively from interactive feedback.

Result: 实验结果表明这些轻量级模块有效提升了小型语言模型在知识图问答任务中的性能

Conclusion: 通过将知识图遍历任务分离出来，可以在不依赖大型模型的情况下实现高效的知识图集成和推理

Abstract: Integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) into the reasoning processes of large
language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate
hallucination. However, existing work in this area often relies on proprietary
or extremely large models, limiting accessibility and scalability. In this
study, we investigate the capabilities of existing integration methods for
small language models (SLMs) in KG-based question answering and observe that
their performance is often constrained by their limited ability to traverse and
reason over knowledge graphs. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging
simple and efficient exploration modules to handle knowledge graph traversal in
place of the language model itself. Experiment results demonstrate that these
lightweight modules effectively improve the performance of small language
models on knowledge graph question answering tasks. Source code:

TL;DR: 提出了LongEmotion基准测试，专注于长上下文情感智能任务，平均输入长度8777个token。引入了RAG和CoEM方法，在大多数任务上显著提升了LLMs的情感智能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试忽略了长上下文场景下的情感智能评估，特别是在真实、实用的设置中，交互通常是冗长、多样且嘈杂的。需要向更现实的设置推进。

Method: 1) 构建LongEmotion基准，包含6类情感任务；2) 提出RAG方法，利用对话上下文和LLM本身作为检索源；3) 提出CoEM方法，将任务分解为5个阶段，整合检索增强和有限知识注入。

Result: 实验结果显示，RAG和CoEM方法在大多数长上下文任务中一致提升了情感智能相关性能，推动了LLMs向更实用和真实世界的情感智能应用发展。

Conclusion: LongEmotion基准填补了长上下文情感智能评估的空白，提出的RAG和CoEM方法有效提升了LLMs在真实场景下的情感智能表现，为实际应用提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make significant progress in Emotional
Intelligence (EI) and long-context understanding. However, existing benchmarks
tend to overlook certain aspects of EI in long-context scenarios, especially
under realistic, practical settings where interactions are lengthy, diverse,
and often noisy. To move towards such realistic settings, we present
LongEmotion, a benchmark specifically designed for long-context EI tasks. It
covers a diverse set of tasks, including Emotion Classification, Emotion
Detection, Emotion QA, Emotion Conversation, Emotion Summary, and Emotion
Expression. On average, the input length for these tasks reaches 8,777 tokens,
with long-form generation required for Emotion Expression. To enhance
performance under realistic constraints, we incorporate Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) and Collaborative Emotional Modeling (CoEM), and compare them
with standard prompt-based methods. Unlike conventional approaches, our RAG
method leverages both the conversation context and the large language model
itself as retrieval sources, avoiding reliance on external knowledge bases. The
CoEM method further improves performance by decomposing the task into five
stages, integrating both retrieval augmentation and limited knowledge
injection. Experimental results show that both RAG and CoEM consistently
enhance EI-related performance across most long-context tasks, advancing LLMs
toward more practical and real-world EI applications. Furthermore, we conducted
a comparative case study experiment on the GPT series to demonstrate the
differences among various models in terms of EI. Code is available on GitHub at

Abstract: Positive, supportive online communication in social media (candy speech) has
the potential to foster civility, yet automated detection of such language
remains underexplored, limiting systematic analysis of its impact. We
investigate how candy speech can be reliably detected in a 46k-comment German
YouTube corpus by monolingual and multilingual language models, including
GBERT, Qwen3 Embedding, and XLM-RoBERTa. We find that a multilingual
XLM-RoBERTa-Large model trained to detect candy speech at the span level
outperforms other approaches, ranking first in both binary positive F1: 0.8906)
and categorized span-based detection (strict F1: 0.6307) subtasks at the
GermEval 2025 Shared Task on Candy Speech Detection. We speculate that
span-based training, multilingual capabilities, and emoji-aware tokenizers
improved detection performance. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of
multilingual models in identifying positive, supportive language.

Motivation: 识别医疗健康领域中的汉痴性语言对医疗不公平现象有重要影响，但目前缺乏统一标准的词典来定义哪些词汇构成汉痴性语言。

Method: 进行系统性文献检索找到现有的汉痴性语言词典，然后进行对比分析，重点考察：1）各词典之间的相似性和差异；2）基于已建立的情感数据集的正面、负面或中性词汇的分布情况。

Result: 检索到四个词典，分析显示它们之间存在中等的语义相似性，大多数汉痴性词汇与临床医生对感知到的负面行为的评判性表达有关。情感分析显示以负面分类词汇为主，但不同词典间存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了制定标准化词典的必要性，同时也揭示了在定义临床文本中汉痴性语言时所面临的挑战。

Abstract: Stigmatizing language results in healthcare inequities, yet there is no
universally accepted or standardized lexicon defining which words, terms, or
phrases constitute stigmatizing language in healthcare. We conducted a
systematic search of the literature to identify existing stigmatizing language
lexicons and then analyzed them comparatively to examine: 1) similarities and
discrepancies between these lexicons, and 2) the distribution of positive,
negative, or neutral terms based on an established sentiment dataset. Our
search identified four lexicons. The analysis results revealed moderate
semantic similarity among them, and that most stigmatizing terms are related to
judgmental expressions by clinicians to describe perceived negative behaviors.
Sentiment analysis showed a predominant proportion of negatively classified
terms, though variations exist across lexicons. Our findings underscore the
need for a standardized lexicon and highlight challenges in defining
stigmatizing language in clinical texts.

Abstract: Detecting content that contradicts or is unsupported by a given source text
is a critical challenge for the safe deployment of generative language models.
We introduce HALT-RAG, a post-hoc verification system designed to identify
hallucinations in the outputs of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines. Our flexible and task-adaptable framework uses a universal feature
set derived from an ensemble of two frozen, off-the-shelf Natural Language
Inference (NLI) models and lightweight lexical signals. These features are used
to train a simple, calibrated, and task-adapted meta-classifier. Using a
rigorous 5-fold out-of-fold (OOF) training protocol to prevent data leakage and
produce unbiased estimates, we evaluate our system on the HaluEval benchmark.
By pairing our universal feature set with a lightweight, task-adapted
classifier and a precision-constrained decision policy, HALT-RAG achieves
strong OOF F1-scores of 0.7756, 0.9786, and 0.7391 on the summarization, QA,
and dialogue tasks, respectively. The system's well-calibrated probabilities
enable a practical abstention mechanism, providing a reliable tool for
balancing model performance with safety requirements.

Motivation: 当前科学领域的实体识别任务依赖LLM微调，但微调成本高昂。需要在性能与成本之间找到最佳平衡点。

Method: 提出三阶段主动学习框架：1）使用不同策略选择信息量最大的样本 2）构建真实检索语料库 3）用于LLM上下文学习

Result: 在三个专业领域数据集上，ALLabel在相同标注预算下始终优于所有基线方法，仅标注5%-10%数据即可达到全量标注性能

Conclusion: ALLabel框架有效解决了LLM实体识别的高标注成本问题，具有很好的有效性和泛化性

Abstract: Many contemporary data-driven research efforts in the natural sciences, such
as chemistry and materials science, require large-scale, high-performance
entity recognition from scientific datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have
increasingly been adopted to solve the entity recognition task, with the same
trend being observed on all-spectrum NLP tasks. The prevailing entity
recognition LLMs rely on fine-tuned technology, yet the fine-tuning process
often incurs significant cost. To achieve a best performance-cost trade-off, we
propose ALLabel, a three-stage framework designed to select the most
informative and representative samples in preparing the demonstrations for LLM
modeling. The annotated examples are used to construct a ground-truth retrieval
corpus for LLM in-context learning. By sequentially employing three distinct
active learning strategies, ALLabel consistently outperforms all baselines
under the same annotation budget across three specialized domain datasets.
Experimental results also demonstrate that selectively annotating only 5\%-10\%
of the dataset with ALLabel can achieve performance comparable to the method
annotating the entire dataset. Further analyses and ablation studies verify the
effectiveness and generalizability of our proposal.

Method: 采用两阶段学习范式，构建查询驱动的人机-GUI交互框架，在正常条件下自主执行，在不可信场景主动查询人类

Result: 在不可信场景下平均步骤成功率比最先进方法提高20.64%，且不影响正常性能

Conclusion: VeriOS-Agent具有合理性、泛化性和可扩展性，为可信操作系统代理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: With the rapid progress of multimodal large language models, operating system
(OS) agents become increasingly capable of automating tasks through on-device
graphical user interfaces (GUIs). However, most existing OS agents are designed
for idealized settings, whereas real-world environments often present
untrustworthy conditions. To mitigate risks of over-execution in such
scenarios, we propose a query-driven human-agent-GUI interaction framework that
enables OS agents to decide when to query humans for more reliable task
completion. Built upon this framework, we introduce VeriOS-Agent, a trustworthy
OS agent trained with a two-stage learning paradigm that falicitate the
decoupling and utilization of meta-knowledge. Concretely, VeriOS-Agent
autonomously executes actions in normal conditions while proactively querying
humans in untrustworthy scenarios. Experiments show that VeriOS-Agent improves
the average step-wise success rate by 20.64\% in untrustworthy scenarios over
the state-of-the-art, without compromising normal performance. Analysis
highlights VeriOS-Agent's rationality, generalizability, and scalability. The

Method: 提出迭代检索增强知识编辑方法(IRAKE)，通过单编辑事实和完整编辑案例的引导进行问题分解，采用迭代检索策略缓解编辑跳过问题

Result: 实验结果表明IRAKE有效缓解了编辑跳过导致的编辑失败，在多跳问答知识编辑任务上优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: IRAKE通过引导分解和迭代检索有效解决了多跳问答中的知识编辑挑战，为知识更新提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: In a rapidly evolving world where information updates swiftly, knowledge in
large language models (LLMs) becomes outdated quickly. Retraining LLMs is not a
cost-effective option, making knowledge editing (KE) without modifying
parameters particularly necessary. We find that although existing
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based KE methods excel at editing simple
knowledge, they struggle with KE in multi-hop question answering due to the
issue of "edit skipping", which refers to skipping the relevant edited fact in
inference. In addition to the diversity of natural language expressions of
knowledge, edit skipping also arises from the mismatch between the granularity
of LLMs in problem-solving and the facts in the edited memory. To address this
issue, we propose a novel Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Editing
method with guided decomposition (IRAKE) through the guidance from single
edited facts and entire edited cases. Experimental results demonstrate that
IRAKE mitigates the failure of editing caused by edit skipping and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods for KE in multi-hop question answering.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been substantial progress in using pretrained
Language Models (LMs) on a range of tasks aimed at improving the understanding
of biomedical texts. Nonetheless, existing biomedical LLMs show limited
comprehension of complex, domain-specific concept structures and the factual
information encoded in biomedical Knowledge Graphs (KGs). In this work, we
propose BALI (Biomedical Knowledge Graph and Language Model Alignment), a novel
joint LM and KG pre-training method that augments an LM with external knowledge
by the simultaneous learning of a dedicated KG encoder and aligning the
representations of both the LM and the graph. For a given textual sequence, we
link biomedical concept mentions to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)
KG and utilize local KG subgraphs as cross-modal positive samples for these
mentions. Our empirical findings indicate that implementing our method on
several leading biomedical LMs, such as PubMedBERT and BioLinkBERT, improves
their performance on a range of language understanding tasks and the quality of
entity representations, even with minimal pre-training on a small alignment
dataset sourced from PubMed scientific abstracts.

Motivation: 临床报告通常长缠且包含专业术语，导致医护人员难以高效识别文档中的重要信息，影响医患共同决策的效果。

Method: 采用迭代自我提示技术，让大语言模型通过基于示例的少样本学习生成任务特定提示并进行精炼；使用ROUGE和BERT-score词汇和嵌入空间指标指导模型微调。

Result: 在3,396份来自不同专业的临床案例报告上，使用GPT-4和GPT-4o的视角感知ISP方法获得了ROUGE分数(46.53, 24.68, 30.77)和BERTscore(87.84, 83.25, 85.46)，高BERTscore表明生成摘要在语义上与参考摘要高度相似。

Conclusion: 视角感知迭代自我提示技术可以有效应用于临床报告摘要，支持更好的医患沟通，尽管词汇层面的直接匹配度较低。

Abstract: Efficient communication between patients and clinicians plays an important
role in shared decision-making. However, clinical reports are often lengthy and
filled with clinical jargon, making it difficult for domain experts to identify
important aspects in the document efficiently. This paper presents the
methodology we applied in the MultiClinSUM shared task for summarising clinical
case documents. We used an Iterative Self-Prompting technique on large language
models (LLMs) by asking LLMs to generate task-specific prompts and refine them
via example-based few-shot learning. Furthermore, we used lexical and embedding
space metrics, ROUGE and BERT-score, to guide the model fine-tuning with
epochs. Our submission using perspective-aware ISP on GPT-4 and GPT-4o achieved
ROUGE scores (46.53, 24.68, 30.77) and BERTscores (87.84, 83.25, 85.46) for (P,
R, F1) from the official evaluation on 3,396 clinical case reports from various
specialties extracted from open journals. The high BERTscore indicates that the
model produced semantically equivalent output summaries compared to the
references, even though the overlap at the exact lexicon level is lower, as
reflected in the lower ROUGE scores. This work sheds some light on how
perspective-aware ISP (PA-ISP) can be deployed for clinical report
summarisation and support better communication between patients and clinicians.

Conclusion: MoLoRAG通过逻辑感知的检索框架有效解决了多模态多页文档理解中的逻辑连接缺失问题，显著提升了文档问答性能

Abstract: Document Understanding is a foundational AI capability with broad
applications, and Document Question Answering (DocQA) is a key evaluation task.
Traditional methods convert the document into text for processing by Large
Language Models (LLMs), but this process strips away critical multi-modal
information like figures. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) address
this limitation, their constrained input size makes multi-page document
comprehension infeasible. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods mitigate
this by selecting relevant pages, but they rely solely on semantic relevance,
ignoring logical connections between pages and the query, which is essential
for reasoning.
  To this end, we propose MoLoRAG, a logic-aware retrieval framework for
multi-modal, multi-page document understanding. By constructing a page graph
that captures contextual relationships between pages, a lightweight VLM
performs graph traversal to retrieve relevant pages, including those with
logical connections often overlooked. This approach combines semantic and
logical relevance to deliver more accurate retrieval. After retrieval, the
top-$K$ pages are fed into arbitrary LVLMs for question answering. To enhance
flexibility, MoLoRAG offers two variants: a training-free solution for easy
deployment and a fine-tuned version to improve logical relevance checking.
Experiments on four DocQA datasets demonstrate average improvements of 9.68% in
accuracy over LVLM direct inference and 7.44% in retrieval precision over
baselines. Codes and datasets are released at

Motivation: 关系抽取中手动标注训练数据成本高昂，目标关系在文本中稀少且难以发现。LLMs在多分类设置下难以全面捕捉每个关系语义，而二元分类又带来计算开销大的问题

Method: 使用三个模块：关系分组（将相似关系聚类）、关系提取（对每个关系组进行多分类）、标签决策（确定最终关系标签），结合多分类和二元分类的优势

Result: 大量实验证实该框架能够从未标注文本中发现高质量的训练样本

Conclusion: M-BRe框架有效解决了LLMs在关系抽取中的语义捕捉不足和计算复杂度高的问题，为关系抽取提供了高效的训练数据自动提取方案

Abstract: For Relation Extraction (RE), the manual annotation of training data may be
prohibitively expensive, since the sentences that contain the target relations
in texts can be very scarce and difficult to find. It is therefore beneficial
to develop an efficient method that can automatically extract training
instances from unlabeled texts for training RE models. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have been adopted in various natural language processing tasks,
with RE also benefiting from their advances. However, when leveraging LLMs for
RE with predefined relation categories, two key challenges arise. First, in a
multi-class classification setting, LLMs often struggle to comprehensively
capture the semantics of every relation, leading to suboptimal results. Second,
although employing binary classification for each relation individually can
mitigate this issue, it introduces significant computational overhead,
resulting in impractical time complexity for real-world applications.
Therefore, this paper proposes a framework called M-BRe to extract training
instances from unlabeled texts for RE. It utilizes three modules to combine the
advantages of both of the above classification approaches: Relation Grouping,
Relation Extraction, and Label Decision. Extensive experiments confirm its
superior capability in discovering high-quality training samples from unlabeled
texts for RE.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在医疗等敏感领域的应用，水印技术的可靠性成为关键问题。现有评测标准过于关注检测质量的权衡，而忽视了在低熵调环境下水印技术可能导致的事实性风险。

Method: 提出了一个专门针对医疗领域的评估流程，结合评估事实准确性和语义连贯性。使用GPT-Judger和人工验证，引入了事实性权重分数（FWS）这个复合指标，优先考虑事实准确性而非仅是语义连贯性。

Conclusion: 医疗领域的水印技术需要更加关注事实性保持，建议发展领域敏感的水印方案来确保医疗内容的整体性和可靠性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) adapted to sensitive domains such as
medicine, their fluency raises safety risks, particularly regarding provenance
and accountability. Watermarking embeds detectable patterns to mitigate these
risks, yet its reliability in medical contexts remains untested. Existing
benchmarks focus on detection-quality tradeoffs, overlooking factual risks
under low-entropy settings often exploited by watermarking's reweighting
strategy. We propose a medical-focused evaluation workflow that jointly
assesses factual accuracy and coherence. Using GPT-Judger and further human
validation, we introduce the Factuality-Weighted Score (FWS), a composite
metric prioritizing factual accuracy beyond coherence to guide watermarking
deployment in medical domains. Our evaluation shows current watermarking
methods substantially compromise medical factuality, with entropy shifts
degrading medical entity representation. These findings underscore the need for
domain-aware watermarking approaches that preserve the integrity of medical
content.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究全面评估了大型语言模型在不同语言和数据集上的虚假新闻、有害内容和政治偏见检测性能，比较了微调与上下文学习策略，发现微调通常优于上下文学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台上的虚假新闻、极化内容和有害信息传播日益严重，但缺乏对不同大语言模型、使用方法和语言的系统性基准测试。

Method: 在10个数据集和5种语言上测试了参数高效微调和多种上下文学习策略（零样本提示、代码本、少样本学习、思维链等），比较了不同模型的性能。

Result: 上下文学习通常表现不如模型微调，即使是较小的微调模型也能超越大型模型的上下文学习性能。

Conclusion: 微调在特定任务设置中比上下文学习更有效，即使是较小的模型经过微调后也能超越大型模型的上下文学习表现。

Abstract: The spread of fake news, polarizing, politically biased, and harmful content
on online platforms has been a serious concern. With large language models
becoming a promising approach, however, no study has properly benchmarked their
performance across different models, usage methods, and languages. This study
presents a comprehensive overview of different Large Language Models adaptation
paradigms for the detection of hyperpartisan and fake news, harmful tweets, and
political bias. Our experiments spanned 10 datasets and 5 different languages
(English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and Bulgarian), covering both binary and
multiclass classification scenarios. We tested different strategies ranging
from parameter efficient Fine-Tuning of language models to a variety of
different In-Context Learning strategies and prompts. These included zero-shot
prompts, codebooks, few-shot (with both randomly-selected and
diversely-selected examples using Determinantal Point Processes), and
Chain-of-Thought. We discovered that In-Context Learning often underperforms
when compared to Fine-Tuning a model. This main finding highlights the
importance of Fine-Tuning even smaller models on task-specific settings even
when compared to the largest models evaluated in an In-Context Learning setup -
in our case LlaMA3.1-8b-Instruct, Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407 and
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct.

Conclusion: SciNLP填补了NLP领域全文本实体关系抽取数据集的空白，为科学文献结构化信息提取提供了有效基准，支持下游应用的知识图谱自动构建。

Abstract: Structured information extraction from scientific literature is crucial for
capturing core concepts and emerging trends in specialized fields. While
existing datasets aid model development, most focus on specific publication
sections due to domain complexity and the high cost of annotating scientific
texts. To address this limitation, we introduce SciNLP - a specialized
benchmark for full-text entity and relation extraction in the Natural Language
Processing (NLP) domain. The dataset comprises 60 manually annotated full-text
NLP publications, covering 7,072 entities and 1,826 relations. Compared to
existing research, SciNLP is the first dataset providing full-text annotations
of entities and their relationships in the NLP domain. To validate the
effectiveness of SciNLP, we conducted comparative experiments with similar
datasets and evaluated the performance of state-of-the-art supervised models on
this dataset. Results reveal varying extraction capabilities of existing models
across academic texts of different lengths. Cross-comparisons with existing
datasets show that SciNLP achieves significant performance improvements on
certain baseline models. Using models trained on SciNLP, we implemented
automatic construction of a fine-grained knowledge graph for the NLP domain.
Our KG has an average node degree of 3.2 per entity, indicating rich semantic
topological information that enhances downstream applications. The dataset is
publicly available at https://github.com/AKADDC/SciNLP.

TL;DR: 该论文提出DK2R方法，利用大语言模型整合结构化属性和非结构化评论知识，通过两阶段推理提升多模态任务导向对话系统的文本响应生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个主要局限：1）忽视非结构化评论知识；2）未充分利用大语言模型。作者希望充分利用双重知识（结构化和非结构化）结合LLMs来改进多模态任务导向对话中的文本响应生成。

Method: 提出DK2R方法：首先从外部知识库提取结构化和非结构化知识；然后使用LLM评估每种知识类型的效用；最后通过专门推理分别总结意图导向的关键线索，作为辅助信号增强基于LLM的文本响应生成。

Result: 在公共数据集上的大量实验验证了DK2R的优越性。

Conclusion: DK2R方法通过有效整合双重知识和两阶段推理机制，显著提升了多模态任务导向对话系统的文本响应生成性能。

Abstract: Textual response generation is pivotal for multimodal \mbox{task-oriented}
dialog systems, which aims to generate proper textual responses based on the
multimodal context. While existing efforts have demonstrated remarkable
progress, there still exist the following limitations: 1) \textit{neglect of
unstructured review knowledge} and 2) \textit{underutilization of large
language models (LLMs)}. Inspired by this, we aim to fully utilize dual
knowledge (\textit{i.e., } structured attribute and unstructured review
knowledge) with LLMs to promote textual response generation in multimodal
task-oriented dialog systems. However, this task is non-trivial due to two key
challenges: 1) \textit{dynamic knowledge type selection} and 2)
\textit{intention-response decoupling}. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel dual knowledge-enhanced two-stage reasoner by adapting LLMs for
multimodal dialog systems (named DK2R). To be specific, DK2R first extracts
both structured attribute and unstructured review knowledge from external
knowledge base given the dialog context. Thereafter, DK2R uses an LLM to
evaluate each knowledge type's utility by analyzing LLM-generated provisional
probe responses. Moreover, DK2R separately summarizes the intention-oriented
key clues via dedicated reasoning, which are further used as auxiliary signals
to enhance LLM-based textual response generation. Extensive experiments
conducted on a public dataset verify the superiority of DK2R. We have released
the codes and parameters.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TF2是一个用于英罗文学翻译的统一框架，包含数据集创建、微调和评估，发布了12B参数的开源模型和300万句对的合成数据集，在保持竞争力的同时显著降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小规模开源模型在文学翻译这一复杂任务中的性能问题，为低资源语言（如罗马尼亚语）提供高质量文学数据集和可访问的翻译解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段微调流程：先进行指令调优以捕捉特定体裁的叙事风格，然后使用适配器压缩实现高效部署；使用BLEU和基于LLM的五维评估标准（准确性、流畅性、连贯性、风格、文化适应）进行综合评估。

Result: 微调后的模型在流畅性和充分性方面与顶级专有大模型竞争，同时具有开源、可访问和显著成本效益的优势。

Conclusion: TF2提供了一个端到端、可复现的管道，为成本效益翻译、跨语言叙事生成以及在低资源环境中广泛采用开源模型处理文化重要文学内容的研究提供了完整解决方案。

Abstract: Literary translation has recently gained attention as a distinct and complex
task in machine translation research. However, the translation by small open
models remains an open problem. We contribute to this ongoing research by
introducing TINYFABULIST TRANSLATION FRAMEWORK (TF2), a unified framework for
dataset creation, fine tuning, and evaluation in English-Romanian literary
translations, centred on the creation and open release of both a compact, fine
tuned language model (TF2-12B) and large scale synthetic parallel datasets
(DS-TF2-EN-RO-3M and DS-TF2-EN-RO-15K). Building on DS-TF1-EN-3M (TF1), the
largest collection of synthetic English fables to date, we address the need for
rich, high quality literary datasets in low resource languages such as
Romanian. Our pipeline first generates 15k high quality Romanian references
from the TF1 pool using a high performing LLM. We then apply a two stage fine
tuning process to a 12B parameter open weight model: (i) instruction tuning to
capture genre specific narrative style, and (ii) adapter compression for
efficient deployment. Evaluation combines corpus level BLEU and a five
dimension LLM based rubric (accuracy, fluency, coherence, style, cultural
adaptation) to provide a nuanced assessment of translation quality. Results
show that our fine tuned model achieves fluency and adequacy competitive with
top performing large proprietary models, while being open, accessible, and
significantly more cost effective. Alongside the fine tuned model and both
datasets, we publicly release all scripts and evaluation prompts. TF2 thus
provides an end-to-end, reproducible pipeline for research on cost efficient
translation, cross lingual narrative generation, and the broad adoption of open
models for culturally significant literary content in low resource settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型的提示脆弱性问题是否也存在于人类标注者中，探索提示脆弱性是否反映了人类标注的固有方差。

Method: 通过文本分类任务，对LLM和人类标注者使用相同的指令修改，系统比较两者对提示变化的敏感性。

Result: 人类和LLM都对标签集和标签格式变化表现出脆弱性，但人类对拼写错误和标签顺序反转的影响较小。

Conclusion: 提示脆弱性并非LLM特有，人类也存在类似敏感性，但LLM在某些类型的提示修改上更加脆弱。

Abstract: The output of large language models (LLM) is unstable, due to both
non-determinism of the decoding process as well as to prompt brittleness. While
the intrinsic non-determinism of LLM generation may mimic existing uncertainty
in human annotations through distributional shifts in outputs, it is largely
assumed, yet unexplored, that the prompt brittleness effect is unique to LLMs.
This raises the question: do human annotators show similar sensitivity to
instruction changes? If so, should prompt brittleness in LLMs be considered
problematic? One may alternatively hypothesize that prompt brittleness
correctly reflects human annotation variances. To fill this research gap, we
systematically compare the effects of prompt modifications on LLMs and
identical instruction modifications for human annotators, focusing on the
question of whether humans are similarly sensitive to prompt perturbations. To
study this, we prompt both humans and LLMs for a set of text classification
tasks conditioned on prompt variations. Our findings indicate that both humans
and LLMs exhibit increased brittleness in response to specific types of prompt
modifications, particularly those involving the substitution of alternative
label sets or label formats. However, the distribution of human judgments is
less affected by typographical errors and reversed label order than that of
LLMs.

Result: 平均得分47.90%，在共享任务中排名第四，证明了方法在偏见检测、分类和缓解方面的有效性

Conclusion: 基于LLM微调和集成学习的方法能有效处理中文性别偏见检测任务，多温度采样机制有助于提升偏见生成检测和缓解性能

Abstract: This paper presents our team's solution to Shared Task 7 of NLPCC-2025, which
focuses on sentence-level gender bias detection and mitigation in Chinese. The
task aims to promote fairness and controllability in natural language
generation by automatically detecting, classifying, and mitigating gender bias.
To address this challenge, we adopt a fine-tuning approach based on large
language models (LLMs), efficiently adapt to the bias detection task via
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). In terms of data processing, we construct a more
balanced training set to alleviate class imbalance and introduce heterogeneous
samples from multiple sources to enhance model generalization. For the
detection and classification sub-tasks, we employ a majority voting strategy
that integrates outputs from multiple expert models to boost performance.
Additionally, to improve bias generation detection and mitigation, we design a
multi-temperature sampling mechanism to capture potential variations in bias
expression styles. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in bias detection, classification, and mitigation. Our method
ultimately achieves an average score of 47.90%, ranking fourth in the shared
task.

Motivation: 随着家长越来越多地使用大语言模型生成睡前故事，这些叙事中存在的文化和性别刻板印象引发了严重担忧

Method: 构建Biased Tales综合数据集，分析偏见如何影响LLM生成故事中主角属性和故事元素

Result: 发现显著的性别差异和文化偏见：女孩主角外貌属性增加55.26%；非西方儿童故事过度强调文化遗产、传统和家庭主题

Conclusion: 研究结果凸显了社会文化偏见在使创意AI使用更加公平和多样化方面的重要作用

Abstract: Stories play a pivotal role in human communication, shaping beliefs and
morals, particularly in children. As parents increasingly rely on large
language models (LLMs) to craft bedtime stories, the presence of cultural and
gender stereotypes in these narratives raises significant concerns. To address
this issue, we present Biased Tales, a comprehensive dataset designed to
analyze how biases influence protagonists' attributes and story elements in
LLM-generated stories. Our analysis uncovers striking disparities. When the
protagonist is described as a girl (as compared to a boy), appearance-related
attributes increase by 55.26%. Stories featuring non-Western children
disproportionately emphasize cultural heritage, tradition, and family themes
far more than those for Western children. Our findings highlight the role of
sociocultural bias in making creative AI use more equitable and diverse.

Result: 在NLP任务实验中，比基于语义熵的方法AUROC提升高达29%，校准误差降低超过15%

Conclusion: 基于图的不确定性建模方法有效，GENUINE框架显著提升了LLM不确定性估计的性能

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is essential for enhancing the reliability of Large
Language Models (LLMs), particularly in high-stakes applications. Existing
methods often overlook semantic dependencies, relying on token-level
probability measures that fail to capture structural relationships within the
generated text. We propose GENUINE: Graph ENhanced mUlti-level uncertaINty
Estimation for Large Language Models, a structure-aware framework that
leverages dependency parse trees and hierarchical graph pooling to refine
uncertainty quantification. By incorporating supervised learning, GENUINE
effectively models semantic and structural relationships, improving confidence
assessments. Extensive experiments across NLP tasks show that GENUINE achieves
up to 29% higher AUROC than semantic entropy-based approaches and reduces
calibration errors by over 15%, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-based
uncertainty modeling. The code is available at

TL;DR: Parallel-R1是一个强化学习框架，通过渐进式课程训练使大语言模型具备并行思考能力，在数学推理任务上相比顺序思考模型提升8.4%准确率，并在AIME25上实现42.9%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖监督微调合成数据，鼓励教师强制模仿而非探索和泛化，难以有效训练并行思考能力。需要一种新方法来激活LLMs的并行推理能力。

Method: 提出Parallel-R1强化学习框架，采用渐进式课程：先在简单任务上使用SFT训练并行思考能力，然后转向RL在更难问题上探索和泛化该技能。

Result: 在MATH、AMC23和AIME等数学基准测试中，Parallel-R1成功培养并行思考能力，比直接在挑战性任务上用RL训练的序列思考模型准确率提升8.4%。在AIME25上比基线提升42.9%。

Conclusion: 并行思考可作为训练中的探索支架，临时探索阶段能在RL后解锁更高性能上限。该方法有效解决了并行思考RL训练的冷启动问题。

Abstract: Parallel thinking has emerged as a novel approach for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by exploring multiple reasoning
paths concurrently. However, activating such capabilities through training
remains challenging, as existing methods predominantly rely on supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) over synthetic data, which encourages teacher-forced
imitation rather than exploration and generalization. Different from them, we
propose \textbf{Parallel-R1}, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework
that enables parallel thinking behaviors for complex real-world reasoning
tasks. Our framework employs a progressive curriculum that explicitly addresses
the cold-start problem in training parallel thinking with RL. We first use SFT
on prompt-generated trajectories from easier tasks to instill the parallel
thinking ability, then transition to RL to explore and generalize this skill on
harder problems. Experiments on various math benchmarks, including MATH, AMC23,
and AIME, show that Parallel-R1 successfully instills parallel thinking,
leading to 8.4% accuracy improvements over the sequential thinking model
trained directly on challenging tasks with RL. Further analysis reveals a clear
shift in the model's thinking behavior: at an early stage, it uses parallel
thinking as an exploration strategy, while in a later stage, it uses the same
capability for multi-perspective verification. Most significantly, we validate
parallel thinking as a \textbf{mid-training exploration scaffold}, where this
temporary exploratory phase unlocks a higher performance ceiling after RL,
yielding a 42.9% improvement over the baseline on AIME25. Our model, data, and
code will be open-source at https://github.com/zhengkid/Parallel-R1.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模生物发现需要整合海量异构数据集，但技术批次效应和缺乏可泛化模型是关键障碍。

Method: 采用Transformer架构，设计源特定上下文标记，实现无需重新训练的有效OOD泛化。

Result: 在JUMP数据集上超越ComBat和Harmony等现有方法，在未见Bray数据集上保持高性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了创建真正基于图像的细胞分析基础模型的重要一步，实现了更可靠和可扩展的跨研究生物分析。

Abstract: Large-scale biological discovery requires integrating massive, heterogeneous
datasets like those from the JUMP Cell Painting consortium, but technical batch
effects and a lack of generalizable models remain critical roadblocks. To
address this, we introduce CellPainTR, a Transformer-based architecture
designed to learn foundational representations of cellular morphology that are
robust to batch effects. Unlike traditional methods that require retraining on
new data, CellPainTR's design, featuring source-specific context tokens, allows
for effective out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to entirely unseen
datasets without fine-tuning. We validate CellPainTR on the large-scale JUMP
dataset, where it outperforms established methods like ComBat and Harmony in
both batch integration and biological signal preservation. Critically, we
demonstrate its robustness through a challenging OOD task on the unseen Bray et
al. dataset, where it maintains high performance despite significant domain and
feature shifts. Our work represents a significant step towards creating truly
foundational models for image-based profiling, enabling more reliable and
scalable cross-study biological analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单模态检测方法在铁路结构元素检测中存在过检测问题，特别是当缺陷外观与正常结构元素相似时，需要多模态信息融合来提高检测精度

Method: 使用YOLOv8n进行快速目标检测，结合Vision Transformer从多个层级（7、16、19层）提取特征图，并与合成的音频表示进行融合，针对铁路断裂和表面缺陷两类缺陷

Result: 在真实铁路数据集上的实验表明，多模态融合方法相比纯视觉方法精度和整体准确率提高了0.2个点，t检验证实了准确率差异的统计显著性

Conclusion: 提出的多模态融合架构有效解决了铁路缺陷检测中的过检测问题，通过结合视觉和音频信息显著提升了检测性能，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Multimodal fusion is a multimedia technique that has become popular in the
wide range of tasks where image information is accompanied by a signal/audio.
The latter may not convey highly semantic information, such as speech or music,
but some measures such as audio signal recorded by mics in the goal to detect
rail structure elements or defects. While classical detection approaches such
as You Only Look Once (YOLO) family detectors can be efficiently deployed for
defect detection on the image modality, the single modality approaches remain
limited. They yield an overdetection in case of the appearance similar to
normal structural elements. The paper proposes a new multimodal fusion
architecture built on the basis of domain rules with YOLO and Vision
transformer backbones. It integrates YOLOv8n for rapid object detection with a
Vision Transformer (ViT) to combine feature maps extracted from multiple layers
(7, 16, and 19) and synthesised audio representations for two defect classes:
rail Rupture and Surface defect. Fusion is performed between audio and image.
Experimental evaluation on a real-world railway dataset demonstrates that our
multimodal fusion improves precision and overall accuracy by 0.2 points
compared to the vision-only approach. Student's unpaired t-test also confirms
statistical significance of differences in the mean accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于特征的后处理方法通常需要访问训练数据，这在数据隐私保护场景下不适用。需要开发不依赖训练数据的OOD检测方法。

Method: ClaFR方法：1）对分类器权重进行正交分解提取类已知子空间；2）将原始特征映射到该子空间获得新表示；3）计算子空间内的特征重构误差作为OOD分数。

Result: 在多个OOD基准测试中取得了领先性能，且不需要访问训练数据。

Conclusion: ClaFR是一种简单有效的后处理OOD检测方法，通过子空间投影视角解决了训练数据不可访问的问题，在保持高性能的同时保护了数据隐私。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection helps models identify data outside the
training categories, crucial for security applications. While feature-based
post-hoc methods address this by evaluating data differences in the feature
space without changing network parameters, they often require access to
training data, which may not be suitable for some data privacy scenarios. This
may not be suitable in scenarios where data privacy protection is a concern. In
this paper, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc method, termed
Classifier-based Feature Reconstruction (ClaFR), from the perspective of
subspace projection. It first performs an orthogonal decomposition of the
classifier's weights to extract the class-known subspace, then maps the
original data features into this subspace to obtain new data representations.
Subsequently, the OOD score is determined by calculating the feature
reconstruction error of the data within the subspace. Compared to existing OOD
detection algorithms, our method does not require access to training data while
achieving leading performance on multiple OOD benchmarks. Our code is released
at https://github.com/Aie0923/ClaFR.

Result: 该方法在各种数据模态和骨干网络选择上表现稳定，仅使用1000张图像就能为DINOv3等最先进模型带来显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: DIET-CP为小规模专业领域数据集的持续预训练提供了简单有效的解决方案，填补了现有方法的空白。

Abstract: Continued pretraining offers a promising solution for adapting foundation
models to a new target domain. However, in specialized domains, available
datasets are often very small, limiting the applicability of SSL methods
developed for large-scale pretraining and making hyperparameter search
infeasible. In addition, pretrained models are usually released as
backbone-weights only, lacking important information to continue pretraining.
We propose to bridge this gap with DIET-CP, a simple continued pretraining
strategy, where any strong foundation model can be steered towards the new data
distribution of interest. DIET-CP relies on a very simple objective, requires
no labels, and introduces no more hyperparameters than supervised finetuning.
It is stable across data modalities and backbone choices, while providing a
significant performance boost for state-of-the-art models such as DINOv3 using
only 1000 images.

TL;DR: FedAPT是一种增强联邦提示调优对抗鲁棒性的新方法，通过类别感知提示生成器和跨层生成器共享策略解决非IID设置下的类别信息差距问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦提示调优方法在面对对抗攻击时容易导致下游任务错误分类，特别是在非独立同分布设置下存在客户端与全局模型之间的类别信息差距问题

Method: 提出类别感知提示生成器，利用全局标签嵌入作为引导生成视觉提示；采用跨层生成器共享策略增强不同层间的提示耦合

Result: 在多个图像分类数据集上表现出优越的对抗鲁棒性，大幅超越现有方法，在跨域和跨数据集场景中展现出卓越的泛化能力

Conclusion: FedAPT能有效提升联邦提示调优的对抗鲁棒性，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Federated Prompt Tuning (FPT) is an efficient method for cross-client
collaborative fine-tuning of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However,
models tuned using FPT are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to
misclassification in downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce Federated
Adversarial Prompt Tuning (\textbf{FedAPT}), a novel method designed to enhance
the adversarial robustness of FPT. We identify a key issue in FedAPT under
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings: a \textit{class
information gap} between clients and the global model. Clients rely solely on
limited local label information to generate adversarial samples for training,
while the global model must defend against adversarial attacks from global
labels. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{class-aware prompt
generator} that generates visual prompts from text prompts. This generator is
guided by a \emph{Global Label Embedding} (serving as a ``beacon") which
encodes cross-client label information to create more globally-aligned visual
prompts. Additionally, we propose a \textbf{cross-layer generator sharing}
strategy to enhance prompt coupling across different layers of the model,
further boosting adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple
image classification datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedAPT in
improving adversarial robustness, outperforming existing methods by a large
margin. FedAPT also exhibits exceptional generalization in cross-domain and
cross-dataset scenarios, indicating its effectiveness in real-world
applications.

TL;DR: ViLD框架填补了学术评估与企业部署需求之间的差距，通过10个关键业务任务和创新的BlockWeaver算法，在7500个真实样本上评估开源VLM模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试主要依赖选择题和合成数据，无法反映真实企业应用场景的复杂性，如社交媒体内容分析

Method: 提出ViLD评估框架，包含10个业务关键任务；开发BlockWeaver算法用于无序OCR输出比较；构建7500个多样化真实样本数据集；结合语义匹配、传统指标和新方法进行综合评估

Result: 在Qwen、MIMO和InternVL等开源VLM模型上进行了行业基准测试，提供了首个基于任务的VLM能力评估

Conclusion: ViLD为企业在真实环境中部署VLM提供了可操作的见解和行业基础评估框架

Abstract: Open-source Vision-Language Models show immense promise for enterprise
applications, yet a critical disconnect exists between academic evaluation and
enterprise deployment requirements. Current benchmarks rely heavily on
multiple-choice questions and synthetic data, failing to capture the complexity
of real-world business applications like social media content analysis. This
paper introduces VLM-in-the-Wild (ViLD), a comprehensive framework to bridge
this gap by evaluating VLMs on operational enterprise requirements. We define
ten business-critical tasks: logo detection, OCR, object detection, human
presence and demographic analysis, human activity and appearance analysis,
scene detection, camera perspective and media quality assessment, dominant
colors, comprehensive description, and NSFW detection. To this framework, we
bring an innovative BlockWeaver Algorithm that solves the challenging problem
of comparing unordered, variably-grouped OCR outputs from VLMs without relying
on embeddings or LLMs, achieving remarkable speed and reliability. To
demonstrate efficacy of ViLD, we constructed a new benchmark dataset of 7,500
diverse samples, carefully stratified from a corpus of one million real-world
images and videos. ViLD provides actionable insights by combining semantic
matching (both embedding-based and LLM-as-a-judge approaches), traditional
metrics, and novel methods to measure the completeness and faithfulness of
descriptive outputs. By benchmarking leading open-source VLMs (Qwen, MIMO, and
InternVL) against a powerful proprietary baseline as per ViLD framework, we
provide one of the first industry-grounded, task-driven assessment of VLMs
capabilities, offering actionable insights for their deployment in enterprise
environments.

### [46] [The Protocol Genome A Self Supervised Learning Framework from DICOM Headers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06995)
*Jimmy Joseph*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Protocol Genome是一个自监督学习系统，通过分析DICOM头部信息来学习医学影像协议相关性，在外部验证中达到AUROC 0.901，显著提升跨站点和跨设备的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床影像通过PACS/DICOM系统传输，扫描协议选择（扫描仪型号、序列、参数等）会影响图像对比度、噪声和伪影，这些潜在混杂因素阻碍了仅基于图像的神经网络在不同站点间的泛化能力。

Method: 将结构化DICOM头部信息作为标签，通过三种方式学习协议感知但临床鲁棒的图像表示：(1)协议-图像对比学习，(2)掩码协议预测，(3)协议-协议转换。使用126万项研究数据进行训练。

Result: 在三个临床任务上表现优异：肺栓塞CT分诊（+0.046 AUROC）、脑胶质瘤MRI分级（+0.058 AUROC）、心胸比X光检测（+0.041 AUROC），校准性能提升25-37%，且在10-20%标注数据下仍保持优势。

Conclusion: Protocol Genome能有效减少协议边界处的假阳性，适用于PACS系统，提供了模型卡片和部署指南，包括去标识化和偏倚审计，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Protocol Genome, a self-supervised learning
system that learns correlations from DICOM headers and achieves AUROC 0.901 (vs
0.847 baseline) and ECE 0.036 (vs 0.058) on fully held-out external validation.
Our method also improves calibration and robustness across modalities (CT, MRI,
CXR) and vendors. Clinical imaging is funneled through PACS/DICOM, where
procedure choices (scanner make/model, sequence, kernel, kVp, TR/TE, and slice
thickness) have consequences for contrast, noise, and artifact. These latent
confounders impede the generalization of image-only networks across sites. We
consider structured DICOM headers as a label and learn protocol-aware but
clinically robust image representations. Protocol Genome obtains tokenized
embeddings of de-identified header fields and models them along with image
features using: (1) protocol-image contrastive learning, (2) masked protocol
prediction, and (3) protocol-protocol translation. With 1.26M studies (7 health
systems, 31 scanners, 3 vendors; CT, MR, CR/DR), we experiment on: (A) chest CT
triage for PE, (B) brain MRI glioma grading, and (C) chest radiograph
cardiomegaly detection. Relative to strong SSL baselines (SimCLR, MAE) as well
as ImageNet transfer, Protocol Genome (+0.046: PE, +0.058: glioma, +0.041:
cardiomegaly) is associated with higher external AUROC; 25-37% calibration
improvements are obtained (p < 0.01, DeLong tests). While the gains may be
task-dependent, they are preserved with 10-20% of labeled data. From a clinical
point of view, the technique reduces false positives at protocol borders and is
applicable in a PACS (DICOM C-FIND/C-MOVE, DICOMweb QIDO/WADO). We publish a
model card and deployment guide, complete with both de-identification and bias
audits.

Motivation: 研究人类识别碎片化、融合或遮挡文字的异常能力，并探索先进视觉语言模型是否具备相似的识别强锐性。

Method: 构建了两个受心理物理学启发的测试标准（中文象形文字和英语字母词），通过切割、重新组合和叠加字形来创造人类可读但模型难以识别的刺激物。

Result: 当代VLMs在这些干扰下表现严重下降，经常产生无关或不连贯的输出，显示模型过于依赖通用视觉不变性而忽视了组合性先验知识。

Conclusion: 研究结果为开发能够编码符号分割、组合和绑定的架构提供了动力，并为多模态系统在教育、无障碍、文化遗产和安全领域的部署描述了具体挑战。

Abstract: Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic
communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words
even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper
investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this
resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct
writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing,
recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli
for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on
clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations,
frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a
structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but
under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release
stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate
transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures
and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and
binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying
multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and
security.

Motivation: 解决心脏磁共振成像中高质量多样化k空间数据稀缺的问题，传统图像域像素级卷积方法在低数据条件下重建效果有限

Method: 在频率域进行特征级学习，利用傅里叶变换的全局表示能力，采用时间融合策略整合多时间帧的k空间数据来指导生成过程

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在低数据条件下具有强大的生成能力，能够有效缓解动态MRI重建中的数据稀缺问题

Conclusion: 频率域特征级建模结合时间融合策略为动态心脏MRI重建提供了一种有效的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力

Abstract: Owing to the inherently dynamic and complex characteristics of cardiac
magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, high-quality and diverse k-space data are
rarely available in practice, which in turn hampers robust reconstruction of
dynamic cardiac MRI. To address this challenge, we perform feature-level
learning directly in the frequency domain and employ a temporal-fusion strategy
as the generative guidance to synthesize k-space data. Specifically, leveraging
the global representation capacity of the Fourier transform, the frequency
domain can be considered a natural global feature space. Therefore, unlike
traditional methods that use pixel-level convolution for feature learning and
modeling in the image domain, this letter focuses on feature-level modeling in
the frequency domain, enabling stable and rich generation even with ultra
low-data regimes. Moreover, leveraging the advantages of feature-level modeling
in the frequency domain, we integrate k-space data across time frames with
multiple fusion strategies to steer and further optimize the generative
trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses
strong generative ability in low-data regimes, indicating practical potential
to alleviate data scarcity in dynamic MRI reconstruction.

Motivation: 评估模型是否能够在语义和感知差异过大的类别间转移属性知识，比如识别"有四条腿"属性同时应用于"狗"和"椅子"

Method: 通过LLM驱动语义分组、嵌入相似度阈值、嵌入聚类和超类分区等四种方法逐渐减少训练测试集间的相关性

Result: 训练测试集相关性减少时模型性能急剧下降，聚类方法在减少隐藏相关性和保持可学习性方面最有效

Conclusion: 当前表示学习方法在属性推理任务中存在显著局限性，为未来基准测试构建提供了重要见解

Abstract: Can models generalize attribute knowledge across semantically and
perceptually dissimilar categories? While prior work has addressed attribute
prediction within narrow taxonomic or visually similar domains, it remains
unclear whether current models can abstract attributes and apply them to
conceptually distant categories. This work presents the first explicit
evaluation for the robustness of the attribute prediction task under such
conditions, testing whether models can correctly infer shared attributes
between unrelated object types: e.g., identifying that the attribute "has four
legs" is common to both "dogs" and "chairs". To enable this evaluation, we
introduce train-test split strategies that progressively reduce correlation
between training and test sets, based on: LLM-driven semantic grouping,
embedding similarity thresholding, embedding-based clustering, and
supercategory-based partitioning using ground-truth labels. Results show a
sharp drop in performance as the correlation between training and test
categories decreases, indicating strong sensitivity to split design. Among the
evaluated methods, clustering yields the most effective trade-off, reducing
hidden correlations while preserving learnability. These findings offer new
insights into the limitations of current representations and inform future
benchmark construction for attribute reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly capable of interpreting multimodal
inputs to generate complex 3D shapes, yet robust methods to evaluate geometric
and structural fidelity remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces a human in
the loop framework for the quantitative evaluation of LLM generated 3D models,
supporting applications such as democratization of CAD design, reverse
engineering of legacy designs, and rapid prototyping. We propose a
comprehensive suite of similarity and complexity metrics, including volumetric
accuracy, surface alignment, dimensional fidelity, and topological intricacy,
to benchmark generated models against ground truth CAD references. Using an L
bracket component as a case study, we systematically compare LLM performance
across four input modalities: 2D orthographic views, isometric sketches,
geometric structure trees, and code based correction prompts. Our findings
demonstrate improved generation fidelity with increased semantic richness, with
code level prompts achieving perfect reconstruction across all metrics. A key
contribution of this work is demonstrating that our proposed quantitative
evaluation approach enables significantly faster convergence toward the ground
truth, especially compared to traditional qualitative methods based solely on
visual inspection and human intuition. This work not only advances the
understanding of AI assisted shape synthesis but also provides a scalable
methodology to validate and refine generative models for diverse CAD
applications.

Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅技术虽然在新视角合成中表现出色，但其高内存消耗限制了在边缘设备上的应用。现有压缩方法主要关注存储压缩，未能解决渲染内存的关键瓶颈问题。

Method: 1) 用轻量级的任意方向球面高斯瓣替代内存密集的球谐函数作为颜色表示；2) 提出统一的软剪枝框架，将基元数量和瓣数量剪枝建模为单一约束优化问题。

Conclusion: MEGS²通过联合优化基元数量和参数数量，成功解决了3D高斯泼溅的内存瓶颈问题，为边缘设备部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a dominant novel-view synthesis
technique, but its high memory consumption severely limits its applicability on
edge devices. A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed
to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and
fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this
problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that
tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total
primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented
memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical
harmonics with lightweight arbitrarily-oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our
color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning
framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single
constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a
50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to
existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

Conclusion: 该统一框架给出了一种时间复杂度更低、效果更好的正态性正则化方法，为文本到图像模型的潜在空间优化提供了有效的工具，并展示了在实际应用中的优势

Abstract: We propose a novel regularization loss that enforces standard Gaussianity,
encouraging samples to align with a standard Gaussian distribution. This
facilitates a range of downstream tasks involving optimization in the latent
space of text-to-image models. We treat elements of a high-dimensional sample
as one-dimensional standard Gaussian variables and define a composite loss that
combines moment-based regularization in the spatial domain with power
spectrum-based regularization in the spectral domain. Since the expected values
of moments and power spectrum distributions are analytically known, the loss
promotes conformity to these properties. To ensure permutation invariance, the
losses are applied to randomly permuted inputs. Notably, existing
Gaussianity-based regularizations fall within our unified framework: some
correspond to moment losses of specific orders, while the previous
covariance-matching loss is equivalent to our spectral loss but incurs higher
time complexity due to its spatial-domain computation. We showcase the
application of our regularization in generative modeling for test-time reward
alignment with a text-to-image model, specifically to enhance aesthetics and
text alignment. Our regularization outperforms previous Gaussianity
regularization, effectively prevents reward hacking and accelerates
convergence.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical task in microscopy, essential for accurately
analyzing and interpreting complex visual data. This task can be performed
using custom models trained on domain-specific datasets, transfer learning from
pre-trained models, or foundational models that offer broad applicability.
However, foundational models often present a considerable number of
non-transparent tuning parameters that require extensive manual optimization,
limiting their usability for real-time streaming data analysis. Here, we
introduce a reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models
and illustrate this approach for SAM (Segment Anything Model) framework by
Meta. The reward functions can be constructed to represent the physics of the
imaged system, including particle size distributions, geometries, and other
criteria. By integrating a reward-driven optimization framework, we enhance
SAM's adaptability and performance, leading to an optimized variant, SAM$^{*}$,
that better aligns with the requirements of diverse segmentation tasks and
particularly allows for real-time streaming data segmentation. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of this approach in microscopy imaging, where precise
segmentation is crucial for analyzing cellular structures, material interfaces,
and nanoscale features.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Aymara图像公平性评估基准，用于评估AI生成图像中的社会偏见。研究发现大型多模态模型不仅复制还放大了职业性别刻板印象，存在显著的默认男性偏见，且不同模型的偏见程度差异很大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在文本到图像生成方面取得了革命性进展，但存在延续训练数据中有害社会偏见的风险。先前的研究发现了这些模型中的性别偏见，但方法学限制阻碍了大规模、可比较的跨模型分析。

Method: 使用75个程序生成的性别中性提示词，测试13个商业可用的大型多模态模型，生成刻板男性、刻板女性和非刻板职业的人物图像。使用经过验证的LLM-as-a-judge系统对965张生成图像进行性别代表性评分。

Result: 研究发现：1）LMMs系统性复制并放大职业性别刻板印象；2）模型表现出强烈的默认男性偏见；3）不同模型的偏见程度差异显著（46.7%到73.3%）。表现最佳的模型减少了性别刻板印象并接近性别平等。

Conclusion: 高度偏见并非不可避免的结果，而是设计选择的结果。这项工作提供了迄今为止最全面的跨模型性别偏见基准，强调了标准化自动化评估工具对于促进AI开发问责制和公平性的必要性。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation,
but they risk perpetuating the harmful social biases in their training data.
Prior work has identified gender bias in these models, but methodological
limitations prevented large-scale, comparable, cross-model analysis. To address
this gap, we introduce the Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation, a benchmark for
assessing social bias in AI-generated images. We test 13 commercially available
LMMs using 75 procedurally-generated, gender-neutral prompts to generate people
in stereotypically-male, stereotypically-female, and non-stereotypical
professions. We then use a validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score the 965
resulting images for gender representation. Our results reveal (p < .001 for
all): 1) LMMs systematically not only reproduce but actually amplify
occupational gender stereotypes relative to real-world labor data, generating
men in 93.0% of images for male-stereotyped professions but only 22.5% for
female-stereotyped professions; 2) Models exhibit a strong default-male bias,
generating men in 68.3% of the time for non-stereotyped professions; and 3) The
extent of bias varies dramatically across models, with overall male
representation ranging from 46.7% to 73.3%. Notably, the top-performing model
de-amplified gender stereotypes and approached gender parity, achieving the
highest fairness scores. This variation suggests high bias is not an inevitable
outcome but a consequence of design choices. Our work provides the most
comprehensive cross-model benchmark of gender bias to date and underscores the
necessity of standardized, automated evaluation tools for promoting
accountability and fairness in AI development.

Abstract: Efficient and accurate feed-forward multi-view reconstruction has long been
an important task in computer vision. Recent transformer-based models like VGGT
and $\pi^3$ have achieved impressive results with simple architectures, yet
they face an inherent runtime bottleneck, due to the quadratic complexity of
the global attention layers, that limits the scalability to large image sets.
In this paper, we empirically analyze the global attention matrix of these
models and observe that probability mass concentrates on a small subset of
patch-patch interactions that correspond to cross-view geometric matches.
Motivated by the structured attention and inspired by recent advancement in
large language models, we propose a replacement for the dense global attention
operation based on highly optimized block-sparse kernels, yielding up to
$4\times$ faster inference with comparable task performance. Our retrofit
requires no retraining of the backbone, extends to both VGGT and $\pi^3$, and
supports large image collections. Evaluations on a comprehensive suite of
multi-view benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

*Soruya Saha,Md Nurul Absur,Saptarshi Debroy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了视觉-惯性里程计(VIO)在边缘服务器上的妨攻风险，提出了一种无监督的检测和恢复机制，通过学习攻击免会话的运动规律来检测运行时偏移并恢复位宜一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前将VIO计算交由边缘服务器处理的趋势导致服务器端存在威胁面，细微的位宜欺骗攻击可能累积成显著的偏移，同时避免启发式检查。

Method: 提出一种无监督、无标签的检测和恢复机制。模型在无攻击会话上训练，学习运动的时间规律性，用于检测运行时偏移并启动恢复以恢复位宜一致性。

Result: 在实际的边缘VIO环境中使用ILLIXR测试床进行评估，测试多种欺骗强度。实验结果显示，与无防御基准线相比，该方法在轨迹和位宜错误方面实现了显著的减少。

Conclusion: 该研究成功地证明了通过无监督学习方法可以有效地检测和恢复VIO系统中的妨攻攻击，为边缘计算环境下的VR应用提供了更高的安全性。

Abstract: Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) supports immersive Virtual Reality (VR) by
fusing camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data for real-time pose.
However, current trend of offloading VIO to edge servers can lead server-side
threat surface where subtle pose spoofing can accumulate into substantial
drift, while evading heuristic checks. In this paper, we study this threat and
present an unsupervised, label-free detection and recovery mechanism. The
proposed model is trained on attack-free sessions to learn temporal
regularities of motion to detect runtime deviations and initiate recovery to
restore pose consistency. We evaluate the approach in a realistic offloaded-VIO
environment using ILLIXR testbed across multiple spoofing intensities.
Experimental results in terms of well-known performance metrics show
substantial reductions in trajectory and pose error compared to a no-defense
baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 人脸增强技术虽然能改善面部外观感知质量，但会扭曲生物特征，显著降低深度伪造检测器的准确率，最高攻击成功率可达75.12%，可作为有效的反取证工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人脸增强技术在改善面部感知质量的同时，是否会无意中扭曲生物特征，从而降低深度伪造检测器的准确性，并探讨这些技术是否具有反取证潜力。

Method: 系统评估传统图像处理方法和先进GAN增强方法对深度伪造检测器的影响，分析对朴素、空间和频域检测方法的效果，并进行对抗训练实验评估模型鲁棒性。在FaceForensics++、DeepFakeDetection和CelebDF-v2数据集上进行实验。

Result: 基础增强滤镜可显著降低检测准确率，攻击成功率最高达64.63%；GAN增强技术进一步利用这些漏洞，攻击成功率最高达75.12%。

Conclusion: 人脸增强方法能有效作为反取证工具，强调需要开发更具弹性和适应性的取证方法。

Abstract: Face enhancement techniques are widely used to enhance facial appearance.
However, they can inadvertently distort biometric features, leading to
significant decrease in the accuracy of deepfake detectors. This study
hypothesizes that these techniques, while improving perceptual quality, can
degrade the performance of deepfake detectors. To investigate this, we
systematically evaluate whether commonly used face enhancement methods can
serve an anti-forensic role by reducing detection accuracy. We use both
traditional image processing methods and advanced GAN-based enhancements to
evaluate the robustness of deepfake detectors. We provide a comprehensive
analysis of the effectiveness of these enhancement techniques, focusing on
their impact on Na\"ive, Spatial, and Frequency-based detection methods.
Furthermore, we conduct adversarial training experiments to assess whether
exposure to face enhancement transformations improves model robustness.
Experiments conducted on the FaceForensics++, DeepFakeDetection, and CelebDF-v2
datasets indicate that even basic enhancement filters can significantly reduce
detection accuracy achieving ASR up to 64.63\%. In contrast, GAN-based
techniques further exploit these vulnerabilities, achieving ASR up to 75.12\%.
Our results demonstrate that face enhancement methods can effectively function
as anti-forensic tools, emphasizing the need for more resilient and adaptive
forensic methods.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种全无监督方法，利用Vision Transformer和流形学习技术来发现图像数据中的新类别，在多个标准数据集上创造了新的SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放世界环境中，实际应用程序经常遇到新类别的图像，而传统监督学习需要大量人工标注。虽然之前的研究多采用半监督方法，但本文认为全无监督方法更有潜力。

Method: 结合Vision Transformer的注意力机制生成向量嵌入，并使用流形学习技术来提炼嵌入表示，以更好地抓取数据的内在几何结构，从而提高图像聚类性能。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet-100和Tiny ImageNet数据集上创造了单模态聚类和新类发现的新的State-of-the-Art结果，无论聚类数量是否预先知道。

Conclusion: 该方法体现了全无监督学习在开放世界图像分类任务中的潜力，通过结合Vision Transformer和流形学习技术，能够有效发现数据中的新类别。

Abstract: Working with annotated data is the cornerstone of supervised learning.
Nevertheless, providing labels to instances is a task that requires significant
human effort. Several critical real-world applications make things more
complicated because no matter how many labels may have been identified in a
task of interest, it could be the case that examples corresponding to novel
classes may appear in the future. Not unsurprisingly, prior work in this,
so-called, `open-world' context has focused a lot on semi-supervised
approaches.
  Focusing on image classification, somehow paradoxically, we propose a fully
unsupervised approach to the problem of determining the novel categories in a
particular dataset. Our approach relies on estimating the number of clusters
using Vision Transformers, which utilize attention mechanisms to generate
vector embeddings. Furthermore, we incorporate manifold learning techniques to
refine these embeddings by exploiting the intrinsic geometry of the data,
thereby enhancing the overall image clustering performance. Overall, we
establish new State-of-the-Art results on single-modal clustering and Novel
Class Discovery on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny ImageNet. We do
so, both when the number of clusters is known or unknown ahead of time. The

### [60] [XBusNet: Text-Guided Breast Ultrasound Segmentation via Multimodal Vision-Language Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07213)
*Raja Mallina,Bryar Shareef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XBusNet是一种双提示双分支多模态模型，通过结合全局语义和局部边界精确性，实现了精准的乳腺超声分割，尤其在小症状和低对比度症状上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺超声分割对于可靠测量和定量分析至关重要，但小症状或低对比度症状因薄雾边缘和斑点噪声而难以准确分割。文本提示能提供临床上下文，但直接应用弱定位文本-图像线索容易产生粗糕的分割结果。

Method: 提出XBusNet双提示双分支多模态模型：全局路径基于CLIP Vision Transformer编码整体图像语义，局部U-Net路径重点关注精确边界。使用来自结构化元数据的自动组装提示（形状、边缘、BI-RADS术语），无需手动点击。在BLU数据集上进行五折交叉验证。

Result: XBusNet在BLU数据集上达到最高水平，平均Dice系数为0.8765，IoU为0.8149，超迈六个强基线模型。小症状显示最大收益，缺失区域和假阻性激活更少。分离研究证明全局上下文、局部边界建模和提示调制的补充作用。

Conclusion: 双提示双分支多模态设计通过融合全局语义和局部精确性，产生了准确的乳腺超声分割掩码，提高了小症状和低对比度症状的稳健性。

Abstract: Background: Precise breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation supports reliable
measurement, quantitative analysis, and downstream classification, yet remains
difficult for small or low-contrast lesions with fuzzy margins and speckle
noise. Text prompts can add clinical context, but directly applying weakly
localized text-image cues (e.g., CAM/CLIP-derived signals) tends to produce
coarse, blob-like responses that smear boundaries unless additional mechanisms
recover fine edges. Methods: We propose XBusNet, a novel dual-prompt,
dual-branch multimodal model that combines image features with clinically
grounded text. A global pathway based on a CLIP Vision Transformer encodes
whole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size and location, while a local
U-Net pathway emphasizes precise boundaries and is modulated by prompts that
describe shape, margin, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)
terms. Prompts are assembled automatically from structured metadata, requiring
no manual clicks. We evaluate on the Breast Lesions USG (BLU) dataset using
five-fold cross-validation. Primary metrics are Dice and Intersection over
Union (IoU); we also conduct size-stratified analyses and ablations to assess
the roles of the global and local paths and the text-driven modulation.
Results: XBusNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on BLU, with mean Dice
of 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149, outperforming six strong baselines. Small lesions
show the largest gains, with fewer missed regions and fewer spurious
activations. Ablation studies show complementary contributions of global
context, local boundary modeling, and prompt-based modulation. Conclusions: A
dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal design that merges global semantics with
local precision yields accurate BUS segmentation masks and improves robustness
for small, low-contrast lesions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像数据稀缺限制了深度学习的应用，需要有效的数据扩充方法来提升乳腺癌热成像分类的性能

Method: 采用激活概率模型(DPM)进行数据扩充，将ResNet-50深度特征与U-Net分割胎绕提取的分形维数等非线性手工特征融合，使用XGBoost分类器进行训练

Result: 达到了98.0%的准确率和98.1%的敏感度，DPM扩充方法显著优于传统方法和ProGAN基线

Conclusion: 高级生成模型与可解释特征的协同作用能够构建高准确的医学诊断工具

Abstract: Data scarcity hinders deep learning for medical imaging. We propose a
framework for breast cancer classification in thermograms that addresses this
using a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) for data augmentation. Our
DPM-based augmentation is shown to be superior to both traditional methods and
a ProGAN baseline. The framework fuses deep features from a pre-trained
ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (e.g., Fractal Dimension) derived
from U-Net segmented tumors. An XGBoost classifier trained on these fused
features achieves 98.0\% accuracy and 98.1\% sensitivity. Ablation studies and
statistical tests confirm that both the DPM augmentation and the nonlinear
feature fusion are critical, statistically significant components of this
success. This work validates the synergy between advanced generative models and
interpretable features for creating highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RecA是一种资源高效的后训练方法，通过利用视觉理解编码器嵌入作为密集文本提示，无需标注即可提供丰富监督，显著提升多模态模型的生成和编辑能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态模型训练依赖图像-文本对，但文本标注通常稀疏且缺乏细粒度视觉细节，导致理解与生成之间的不对齐

Method: 提出重建对齐(RecA)方法，让模型基于自身的视觉理解嵌入来重建输入图像，使用自监督重建损失来重新对齐理解和生成能力

Result: 仅用27 GPU小时，在GenEval(0.73→0.90)和DPGBench(80.93→88.15)上显著提升生成性能，编辑基准也有明显改进(ImgEdit 3.38→3.75, GEdit 6.94→7.25)，超越更大开源模型

Conclusion: RecA是一种高效通用的后训练对齐策略，适用于各种多模态架构，能够有效提升模型的生成和编辑保真度

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation
within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on
image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss
fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a
simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a
resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding
encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without
captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding
embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a
self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and
generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across
autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it
consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours,
post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on
GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while
also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit
6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models
and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an
efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无人机多光谱目标检测面临的三个挑战：低光照图像降低多模态互补性、小目标建模受冗余信息干扰、基于Transformer的方法计算复杂度高难以在无人机平台应用

Method: 设计双域增强模块(DDE)包含跨尺度小波Mamba(CSWM)和傅里叶细节恢复块(FDR)来增强低光照图像，以及优先级引导Mamba融合模块(PGMF)通过优先级扫描从局部目标特征开始融合

Result: 在DroneVehicle和VEDAI数据集上，DEPF在目标检测任务中表现优于最先进方法

Conclusion: 基于Mamba线性复杂度的DEPF方法有效解决了无人机多光谱目标检测的关键挑战，在图像增强和目标检测性能方面都有显著提升

Abstract: Multispectral remote sensing object detection is one of the important
application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, it faces three
challenges. Firstly, the low-light remote sensing images reduce the
complementarity during multi-modality fusion. Secondly, the local small target
modeling is interfered with redundant information in the fusion stage easily.
Thirdly, due to the quadratic computational complexity, it is hard to apply the
transformer-based methods on the UAV platform. To address these limitations,
motivated by Mamba with linear complexity, a UAV multispectral object detector
with dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided mamba fusion (DEPF) is
proposed. Firstly, to enhance low-light remote sensing images, Dual-Domain
Enhancement Module (DDE) is designed, which contains Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba
(CSWM) and Fourier Details Recovery block (FDR). CSWM applies cross-scale mamba
scanning for the low-frequency components to enhance the global brightness of
images, while FDR constructs spectrum recovery network to enhance the frequency
spectra features for recovering the texture-details. Secondly, to enhance local
target modeling and reduce the impact of redundant information during fusion,
Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion Module (PGMF) is designed. PGMF introduces the
concept of priority scanning, which starts from local targets features
according to the priority scores obtained from modality difference. Experiments
on DroneVehicle dataset and VEDAI dataset reports that, DEPF performs well on
object detection, comparing with state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
available in the supplementary material.

TL;DR: 提出G$^{3}$CN方法，通过高斯滤波优化骨架拓扑图结构，结合门控循环单元增强信息传播，有效提升骨架动作识别中模糊动作的区分能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GCN在骨架动作识别中虽然有效，但在区分模糊动作方面存在局限性，对拓扑和空间特征的表征能力不足

Method: 提出Gaussian Topology Refinement Gated Graph Convolution (G$^{3}$CN)：1）使用高斯滤波器精炼骨架拓扑图；2）集成门控循环单元(GRU)增强骨架点间信息传播

Result: 在NTU RGB+D、NTU RGB+D 120和NW-UCLA基准测试上取得优异性能，特别是在模糊样本上表现突出，且具有良好的泛化能力

Conclusion: G$^{3}$CN通过拓扑图精炼和门控机制有效解决了骨架动作识别中模糊动作的区分问题，为GCN框架提供了重要改进

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have proven to be highly effective for
skeleton-based action recognition, primarily due to their ability to leverage
graph topology for feature aggregation, a key factor in extracting meaningful
representations. However, despite their success, GCNs often struggle to
effectively distinguish between ambiguous actions, revealing limitations in the
representation of learned topological and spatial features. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel approach, Gaussian Topology Refinement Gated
Graph Convolution (G$^{3}$CN), to address the challenge of distinguishing
ambiguous actions in skeleton-based action recognition. G$^{3}$CN incorporates
a Gaussian filter to refine the skeleton topology graph, improving the
representation of ambiguous actions. Additionally, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
are integrated into the GCN framework to enhance information propagation
between skeleton points. Our method shows strong generalization across various
GCN backbones. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA
benchmarks demonstrate that G$^{3}$CN effectively improves action recognition,
particularly for ambiguous samples.

Motivation: 现有解析图方法主要关注单模态建模，忽略了多模态融合的潜力。语言提供了丰富的空间关系先验，但现有的全局特征融合方法会削弱遮挡区域响应并导致对齐和定位失败

Method: 提出PGVL模型，包含引导模块(GM)。低层节点关注局部特征保持遮挡区域响应，高层节点整合全局特征推断遮挡部位。通过自上而下分解和自下而上组合，构建模态特定解析图，使用递归双向交叉注意力并进行GM净化

Result: 在主要姿态估计数据集上验证了PGVL和网络的有效性

Conclusion: PGVL通过多模态交互和引导机制，有效解决了遮挡场景下的人体姿态估计问题，代码即将发布

Abstract: Parse graphs boost human pose estimation (HPE) by integrating context and
hierarchies, yet prior work mostly focuses on single modality modeling,
ignoring the potential of multimodal fusion. Notably, language offers rich HPE
priors like spatial relations for occluded scenes, but existing visual-language
fusion via global feature integration weakens occluded region responses and
causes alignment and location failures. To address this issue, we propose Parse
Graph-based Visual-Language interaction (PGVL) with a core novel Guided Module
(GM). In PGVL, low-level nodes focus on local features, maximizing the
maintenance of responses in occluded areas and high-level nodes integrate
global features to infer occluded or invisible parts. GM enables high semantic
nodes to guide the feature update of low semantic nodes that have undergone
cross attention. It ensuring effective fusion of diverse information. PGVL
includes top-down decomposition and bottom-up composition. In the first stage,
modality specific parse graphs are constructed. Next stage. recursive
bidirectional cross-attention is used, purified by GM. We also design network
based on PGVL. The PGVL and our network is validated on major pose estimation
datasets. We will release the code soon.

Motivation: 现有的3D生成方法主要关注几何建模，将纹理烘焙为简单顶点颜色或依赖后处理的图像扩散模型，缺乏端到端的PBR材质生成能力。

Method: 采用模块化设计：LGAA Wrapper重用多视角扩散模型层，LGAA Switcher对齐多个扩散先验，LGAA Decoder预测带PBR通道的2D高斯溅射，最后通过后处理提取高质量可重光照网格资产。

Conclusion: LGAA框架成功实现了端到端的PBR就绪3D资产生成，通过知识保留方案和模块化设计在数据效率方面表现优异。

Abstract: The labor- and experience-intensive creation of 3D assets with physically
based rendering (PBR) materials demands an autonomous 3D asset creation
pipeline. However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry
modeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture
synthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end
PBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter
(LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR
materials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel
perspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components.
Specifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV
diffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images,
enabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple
diffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns
multiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed
variational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated
post-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh
assets from the resulting 2DGS. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and
image-conditioned MV diffusion models. Additionally, the modular design enables
flexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors, and the
knowledge-preserving scheme leads to efficient convergence trained on merely
69k multi-view instances. Our code, pre-trained weights, and the dataset used
will be publicly available via our project page:

Result: 现有MLLMs难以准确解释用户意图，而注视引导方法显著提升性能，注视估计准确性影响提示效果

Conclusion: 注视信息对于在自我中心环境中实现更个性化和有效的AI助手具有重要价值

Abstract: The emergence of advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
significantly enhanced AI assistants' ability to process complex information
across modalities. Recently, egocentric videos, by directly capturing user
focus, actions, and context in an unified coordinate, offer an exciting
opportunity to enable proactive and personalized AI user experiences with
MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks overlook the crucial role of gaze as an
indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an
egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze
information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos.
EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by
human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to
accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent
prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial,
temporal, and intent-related cues. We further conduct experiments on
gaze-related fine-tuning and analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts
prompting effectiveness. These results underscore the value of gaze for more
personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings.

Conclusion: GLEAM框架统一了多模态多视角对齐与可解释的对应分析，将准确的跨视角匹配与可解释推理相结合，推动了地理定位技术的发展。

Abstract: Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) focuses on identifying correspondences
between images captured from distinct perspectives of the same geographical
location. However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a
single view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks
interpretability: they merely predict whether two images correspond, without
explaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a
foundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including
UAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning
them exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training
efficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable
to prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy.
Moreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods,
we leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view
correspondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we
construct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro
to generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through
detailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable
cross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in
geo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL
pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable
correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable
reasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain
And Match. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible

Method: 结合跨维度监督(CDS)模块和多尺度特征融合(MSFF)网络，利用2D分层投影作为监督信号，通过多尺度特征提取和通道重加权策略增强血管描绘

Result: 在OCTA-500数据集上表现优异，特别是在临床评估关键的眼前面投影方面有显著改进

Conclusion: XOCT有潜力提高OCTA的可访问性、可靠性和诊断价值，用于眼科疾病的检测和监测

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) and its derived en-face
projections provide high-resolution visualization of the retinal and choroidal
vasculature, which is critical for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of retinal
diseases. However, acquiring high-quality OCTA images is challenging due to
motion sensitivity and the high costs associated with software modifications
for conventional OCT devices. Moreover, current deep learning methods for
OCT-to-OCTA translation often overlook the vascular differences across retinal
layers and struggle to reconstruct the intricate, dense vascular details
necessary for reliable diagnosis. To overcome these limitations, we propose
XOCT, a novel deep learning framework that integrates Cross-Dimensional
Supervision (CDS) with a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) network for
layer-aware vascular reconstruction. Our CDS module leverages 2D layer-wise
en-face projections, generated via segmentation-weighted z-axis averaging, as
supervisory signals to compel the network to learn distinct representations for
each retinal layer through fine-grained, targeted guidance. Meanwhile, the MSFF
module enhances vessel delineation through multi-scale feature extraction
combined with a channel reweighting strategy, effectively capturing vascular
details at multiple spatial scales. Our experiments on the OCTA-500 dataset
demonstrate XOCT's improvements, especially for the en-face projections which
are significant for clinical evaluation of retinal pathologies, underscoring
its potential to enhance OCTA accessibility, reliability, and diagnostic value
for ophthalmic disease detection and monitoring. The code is available at

*Sai Siddhartha Chary Aylapuram,Veeraraju Elluru,Shivang Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于机器遗忘技术的偏置缓解方法，通过选择性移除训练数据中的偏置样本或特征表示来提升视觉模型的公平性，在多个数据集上显著减少了子群体差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在训练数据中往往依赖虚假相关性，导致在医疗和自动驾驶等安全关键领域产生有偏或不公平的预测。传统偏置缓解方法需要从头重新训练或重新设计数据管道，而机器遗忘技术提供了一种有前景的事后模型校正替代方案。

Method: 基于隐私保护遗忘技术，评估了多种策略包括梯度上升、LoRA和师生蒸馏方法。在三个基准数据集（CUB-200-2011的姿态偏置、CIFAR-10的合成补丁偏置、CelebA的微笑检测中的性别偏置）上进行实证分析。

Result: 事后遗忘方法能显著减少子群体差异，在CUB-200上人口统计公平性提升94.86%，CIFAR-10提升30.28%，CelebA提升97.37%。这些改进以最小的准确率损失实现，在效用、公平性、质量和隐私的联合评估中平均得分0.62。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明机器遗忘是一个实用的框架，可以在不需要完全重新训练的情况下增强已部署视觉系统的公平性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations in training data,
leading to biased or unfair predictions in safety-critical domains such as
medicine and autonomous driving. While conventional bias mitigation typically
requires retraining from scratch or redesigning data pipelines, recent advances
in machine unlearning provide a promising alternative for post-hoc model
correction. In this work, we investigate \textit{Bias-Aware Machine
Unlearning}, a paradigm that selectively removes biased samples or feature
representations to mitigate diverse forms of bias in vision models. Building on
privacy-preserving unlearning techniques, we evaluate various strategies
including Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation. Through
empirical analysis on three benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 (pose bias),
CIFAR-10 (synthetic patch bias), and CelebA (gender bias in smile detection),
we demonstrate that post-hoc unlearning can substantially reduce subgroup
disparities, with improvements in demographic parity of up to \textbf{94.86\%}
on CUB-200, \textbf{30.28\%} on CIFAR-10, and \textbf{97.37\%} on CelebA. These
gains are achieved with minimal accuracy loss and with methods scoring an
average of 0.62 across the 3 settings on the joint evaluation of utility,
fairness, quality, and privacy. Our findings establish machine unlearning as a
practical framework for enhancing fairness in deployed vision systems without
necessitating full retraining.

extract global features through attention mechanisms, converting the carbon
stock estimation into an image translation.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in video generation technology, creating
high-quality videos that precisely align with user intentions remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods often fail to achieve fine-grained
control over video details, limiting their practical applicability. We
introduce ANYPORTAL, a novel zero-shot framework for video background
replacement that leverages pre-trained diffusion models. Our framework
collaboratively integrates the temporal prior of video diffusion models with
the relighting capabilities of image diffusion models in a zero-shot setting.
To address the critical challenge of foreground consistency, we propose a
Refinement Projection Algorithm, which enables pixel-level detail manipulation
to ensure precise foreground preservation. ANYPORTAL is training-free and
overcomes the challenges of achieving foreground consistency and temporally
coherent relighting. Experimental results demonstrate that ANYPORTAL achieves
high-quality results on consumer-grade GPUs, offering a practical and efficient
solution for video content creation and editing.

Abstract: Deep neural networks excel in radiological image classification but
frequently suffer from poor interpretability, limiting clinical acceptance. We
present MedicalPatchNet, an inherently self-explainable architecture for chest
X-ray classification that transparently attributes decisions to distinct image
regions. MedicalPatchNet splits images into non-overlapping patches,
independently classifies each patch, and aggregates predictions, enabling
intuitive visualization of each patch's diagnostic contribution without
post-hoc techniques. Trained on the CheXpert dataset (223,414 images),
MedicalPatchNet matches the classification performance (AUROC 0.907 vs. 0.908)
of EfficientNet-B0, while substantially improving interpretability:
MedicalPatchNet demonstrates substantially improved interpretability with
higher pathology localization accuracy (mean hit-rate 0.485 vs. 0.376 with
Grad-CAM) on the CheXlocalize dataset. By providing explicit, reliable
explanations accessible even to non-AI experts, MedicalPatchNet mitigates risks

Abstract: Vector graphics, known for their scalability and user-friendliness, provide a
unique approach to visual content compared to traditional pixel-based images.
Animation of these graphics, driven by the motion of their elements, offers
enhanced comprehensibility and controllability but often requires substantial
manual effort. To automate this process, we propose a novel method that
integrates implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models
for vector graphic animation. Our approach employs layered implicit neural
representations to reconstruct vector graphics, preserving their inherent
properties such as infinite resolution and precise color and shape constraints,
which effectively bridges the large domain gap between vector graphics and
diffusion models. The neural representations are then optimized using video
score distillation sampling, which leverages motion priors from pretrained
text-to-video diffusion models. Finally, the vector graphics are warped to
match the representations resulting in smooth animation. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our method in generating vivid and natural vector
graphic animations, demonstrating significant improvement over existing
techniques that suffer from limitations in flexibility and animation quality.

Abstract: We address vision-language-driven indoor navigation to assist visually

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射（3DGS）在照片级视图合成方面表现出色，但由于其非结构化表示和缺乏显式几何监督，难以实现准确完整的表面重建。

Method: 为每个高斯基元关联可学习的SDF值，设计几何引导的网格增长策略，在多尺度层次下自适应地在几何一致区域分布高斯基元。

Result: 在DTU、Mip-NeRF 360和Tanks&Temples等标准基准测试中，DiGS在保持高渲染保真度的同时，显著提高了重建准确性和完整性。

Conclusion: DiGS通过将SDF学习集成到3DGS中，成功实现了更好的表面重建效果，同时保持了优秀的渲染质量，为3D重建领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
photorealistic view synthesis, representing scenes with spatially distributed
Gaussian primitives. While highly effective for rendering, achieving accurate
and complete surface reconstruction remains challenging due to the unstructured
nature of the representation and the absence of explicit geometric supervision.
In this work, we propose DiGS, a unified framework that embeds Signed Distance
Field (SDF) learning directly into the 3DGS pipeline, thereby enforcing strong
and interpretable surface priors. By associating each Gaussian with a learnable
SDF value, DiGS explicitly aligns primitives with underlying geometry and
improves cross-view consistency. To further ensure dense and coherent coverage,
we design a geometry-guided grid growth strategy that adaptively distributes
Gaussians along geometry-consistent regions under a multi-scale hierarchy.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and
Tanks& Temples, demonstrate that DiGS consistently improves reconstruction
accuracy and completeness while retaining high rendering fidelity.

Motivation: 当前的混合基础攻击策略可能破坏全局语义特征，并且交叉熵损损失导致梯度消失问题，影响对抗性示例的质量

Method: 提出三个关键技术：1)局部混合策略产生语义一致的多样化输入；2)将目标攻击中的logit损失适配到非目标场景；3)应用扰动平滑损失压制高频噪声

Result: 在FGSCR-42和MTARSI数据集上进行了广泛实验，在6个代理模型上超过12种最新方法。在MTARSI上以ResNet为代理模型时，黑盒攻击成功率平均提高17.28%

Conclusion: 该方法通过保持全局语义特征和解决梯度消失问题，显著提高了对抗性攻击的转移能力，为遥感应用中的DNN安全部署提供了有效的安全保障

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing
significant security threats to their deployment in remote sensing
applications. Research on adversarial attacks not only reveals model
vulnerabilities but also provides critical insights for enhancing robustness.
Although current mixing-based strategies have been proposed to increase the
transferability of adversarial examples, they either perform global blending or
directly exchange a region in the images, which may destroy global semantic
features and mislead the optimization of adversarial examples. Furthermore,
their reliance on cross-entropy loss for perturbation optimization leads to
gradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example
quality. To address these limitations, we focus on non-targeted attacks and
propose a novel framework via local mixing and logits optimization. First, we
present a local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent
inputs. Different from MixUp, which globally blends two images, and MixCut,
which stitches images together, our method merely blends local regions to
preserve global semantic information. Second, we adapt the logit loss from
targeted attacks to non-targeted scenarios, mitigating the gradient vanishing
problem of cross-entropy loss. Third, a perturbation smoothing loss is applied
to suppress high-frequency noise and enhance transferability. Extensive
experiments on FGSCR-42 and MTARSI datasets demonstrate superior performance
over 12 state-of-the-art methods across 6 surrogate models. Notably, with
ResNet as the surrogate on MTARSI, our method achieves a 17.28% average
improvement in black-box attack success rate.

Motivation: 3D数据标注成本高昂，现有弱监督方法仅依赖2D框标注存在投影模糊性和部分可见性问题，需要开发更有效的弱监督解决方案

Method: 提出MVAT框架：1）跨时间聚合目标中心点云构建完整3D表示；2）采用师生蒸馏范式，教师网络从单视图学习但目标来自时间聚合的静态对象；3）引入多视图2D投影损失确保3D框与所有可用2D标注的一致性

Conclusion: MVAT证明了利用时序多视图信息可以有效解决弱监督3D检测中的投影模糊性问题，无需任何3D框标注即可实现接近全监督的性能

Abstract: Annotating 3D data remains a costly bottleneck for 3D object detection,
motivating the development of weakly supervised annotation methods that rely on
more accessible 2D box annotations. However, relying solely on 2D boxes
introduces projection ambiguities since a single 2D box can correspond to
multiple valid 3D poses. Furthermore, partial object visibility under a single
viewpoint setting makes accurate 3D box estimation difficult. We propose MVAT,
a novel framework that leverages temporal multi-view present in sequential data
to address these challenges. Our approach aggregates object-centric point
clouds across time to build 3D object representations as dense and complete as
possible. A Teacher-Student distillation paradigm is employed: The Teacher
network learns from single viewpoints but targets are derived from temporally
aggregated static objects. Then the Teacher generates high quality
pseudo-labels that the Student learns to predict from a single viewpoint for
both static and moving objects. The whole framework incorporates a multi-view
2D projection loss to enforce consistency between predicted 3D boxes and all
available 2D annotations. Experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate that MVAT achieves state-of-the-art performance for weakly
supervised 3D object detection, significantly narrowing the gap with fully
supervised methods without requiring any 3D box annotations. % \footnote{Code

Abstract: Hand gesture understanding is essential for several applications in
human-computer interaction, including automatic clinical assessment of hand
dexterity. While deep learning has advanced static gesture recognition, dynamic
gesture understanding remains challenging due to complex spatiotemporal
variations. Moreover, existing datasets often lack multimodal and multi-view
diversity, precise ground-truth tracking, and an action quality component
embedded within gestures. This paper introduces EHWGesture, a multimodal video
dataset for gesture understanding featuring five clinically relevant gestures.
It includes over 1,100 recordings (6 hours), captured from 25 healthy subjects
using two high-resolution RGB-Depth cameras and an event camera. A motion
capture system provides precise ground-truth hand landmark tracking, and all
devices are spatially calibrated and synchronized to ensure cross-modal
alignment. Moreover, to embed an action quality task within gesture
understanding, collected recordings are organized in classes of execution speed
that mirror clinical evaluations of hand dexterity. Baseline experiments
highlight the dataset's potential for gesture classification, gesture trigger
detection, and action quality assessment. Thus, EHWGesture can serve as a
comprehensive benchmark for advancing multimodal clinical gesture
understanding.

Conclusion: UFC展示了在少样本设置下对新空间控制任务的有效泛化能力，适用于多种扩散模型架构

Abstract: Spatial conditioning in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models has
significantly improved fine-grained control over the structure of generated
images. However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and
incur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions
that differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control
adapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few
image-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages
the analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific
control features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small
set of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks
show that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks,
achieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably,
when fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive
performance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks. We
also show that UFC is applicable agnostically to various diffusion backbones
and demonstrate its effectiveness on both UNet and DiT architectures. Code is

Conclusion: 领域特定的MIM方法对医学图像表示学习具有重要价值，前景掩码策略为医学图像分割提供了有前景的研究方向

Abstract: While Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has revolutionized fields of computer
vision, its adoption in 3D medical image computing has been limited by the use
of random masking, which overlooks the density of anatomical objects. To
address this limitation, we enhance the pretext task with a simple yet
effective masking strategy. Leveraging Hounsfield Unit (HU) measurements, we
implement an HU-based Foreground Masking, which focuses on the intensity
distribution of visceral organs and excludes non-tissue regions, such as air
and fluid, that lack diagnostically meaningful features. Extensive experiments
on five public 3D medical imaging datasets demonstrate that our masking
consistently improves performance, both in quality of segmentation and Dice
score (BTCV:~84.64\%, Flare22:~92.43\%, MM-WHS:~90.67\%, Amos22:~88.64\%,

Abstract: Document images encapsulate a wealth of knowledge, while the portability of

we integrate a layout-aware reranking mechanism to refine retrieval.
Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in both efficiency and
accuracy. To advance research in this direction, we also release the first

Abstract: We present a feed-forward framework for Gaussian full-head synthesis from a
single unposed image. Unlike previous work that relies on time-consuming GAN
inversion and test-time optimization, our framework can reconstruct the
Gaussian full-head model given a single unposed image in a single forward pass.
This enables fast reconstruction and rendering during inference. To mitigate
the lack of large-scale 3D head assets, we propose a large-scale synthetic
dataset from trained 3D GANs and train our framework using only synthetic data.
For efficient high-fidelity generation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine Gaussian
head generation pipeline, where sparse points from the FLAME model interact
with the image features by transformer blocks for feature extraction and coarse
shape reconstruction, which are then densified for high-fidelity
reconstruction. To fully leverage the prior knowledge residing in pretrained 3D
GANs for effective reconstruction, we propose a dual-branch framework that
effectively aggregates the structured spherical triplane feature and
unstructured point-based features for more effective Gaussian head
reconstruction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our framework
towards existing work.

Abstract: Deep learning offers a promising avenue for automating many recognition tasks
in fields such as medicine and forensics. However, the black-box nature of
these models hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications where trust and
accountability are required. For 3D shape recognition tasks in particular, this
paper introduces the Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) architecture to
address this need. Applied to 3D meshes of third molars derived from CBCT
images, for Demirjian stage allocation, CGAT utilizes graph attention
convolutions and an inherent attention mechanism, visualized via attention
rollout, to explain its decision-making process. We evaluated the local mean
curvature and distance to centroid node features, both individually and in
combination, as well as model depth, finding that models incorporating directed
edges to a global CLS node produced more intuitive attention maps, while also
yielding desirable classification performance. We analyzed the attention-based
explanations of the models, and their predictive performances to propose
optimal settings for the CGAT. The combination of local mean curvature and
distance to centroid as node features yielded a slight performance increase
with 0.76 weighted F1 score, and more comprehensive attention visualizations.
The CGAT architecture's ability to generate human-understandable attention maps
can enhance trust and facilitate expert validation of model decisions. While
demonstrated on dental data, CGAT is broadly applicable to graph-based
classification and regression tasks, promoting wider adoption of transparent
and competitive deep learning models in high-stakes environments.

Abstract: Temporal image forensics is the science of estimating the age of a digital
image. Usually, time-dependent traces (age traces) introduced by the image
acquisition pipeline are exploited for this purpose. In this review, a
comprehensive overview of the field of temporal image forensics based on
time-dependent traces from the image acquisition pipeline is given. This
includes a detailed insight into the properties of known age traces (i.e.,
in-field sensor defects and sensor dust) and temporal image forensics
techniques. Another key aspect of this work is to highlight the problem of
content bias and to illustrate how important eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence methods are to verify the reliability of temporal image forensics
techniques. Apart from reviewing material presented in previous works, in this
review: (i) a new (probably more realistic) forensic setting is proposed; (ii)
the main properties (growth rate and spatial distribution) of in-field sensor
defects are verified; (iii) it is shown that a method proposed to utilize
in-field sensor defects for image age approximation actually exploits other
traces (most likely content bias); (iv) the features learned by a neural
network dating palmprint images are further investigated; (v) it is shown how
easily a neural network can be distracted from learning age traces. For this
purpose, previous work is analyzed, re-implemented if required and experiments
are conducted.

TL;DR: 研究发现当前视觉语言模型的性别偏见评估容易受到非性别特征（如物体和背景）的干扰，即使微小扰动也会显著改变偏见分数，建议在报告偏见指标时同时报告特征敏感性测量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有性别偏见评估基准中存在性别与非性别特征之间的虚假相关性，需要研究这些虚假特征是否扭曲了性别偏见的评估结果。

Method: 系统性地扰动四个广泛使用的基准（COCO-gender、FACET、MIAP、PHASE）中的非性别特征，并量化其对各种视觉语言模型偏见评估的影响。

Result: 即使仅遮蔽10%的物体或轻微模糊背景等最小扰动，也能显著改变偏见分数，生成式视觉语言模型的指标变化高达175%，CLIP变体变化达43%。

Conclusion: 当前偏见评估往往反映模型对虚假特征而非性别偏见的响应，建议在报告偏见指标时同时报告特征敏感性测量以实现更可靠的偏见评估。

Abstract: Gender bias in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) raises concerns about
their safe deployment and is typically evaluated using benchmarks with gender
annotations on real-world images. However, as these benchmarks often contain
spurious correlations between gender and non-gender features, such as objects
and backgrounds, we identify a critical oversight in gender bias evaluation: Do
spurious features distort gender bias evaluation? To address this question, we
systematically perturb non-gender features across four widely used benchmarks
(COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, and PHASE) and various VLMs to quantify their impact
on bias evaluation. Our findings reveal that even minimal perturbations, such
as masking just 10% of objects or weakly blurring backgrounds, can dramatically
alter bias scores, shifting metrics by up to 175% in generative VLMs and 43% in
CLIP variants. This suggests that current bias evaluations often reflect model
responses to spurious features rather than gender bias, undermining their
reliability. Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is fundamentally
challenging, we recommend reporting bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity
measurements to enable a more reliable bias assessment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有医疗视觉-语言模型在临床应用中的三大问题：患者元数据利用不充分、缺乏临床诊断知识集成、以3D医学形态学数据的适配性差。特别是在阿尔茫海默病诊断领域需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 1. 将结构化患者元数据转换为合成报告，丰富文本输入以改善图像-文本对齐
2. 添加辅助token进行MMSE认知功能评分预测，提供额外监督信号
3. 采用轻量级的图像和文本提示调整技术，将3D CT基础模型适配到3D MRI数据

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种数据高效的细调方案，通过元数据到合成报告的转换和临床评量指标的监督学习，显著提升了医疗视觉-语言模型在3D医学形态学数据上的诊断性能和可迁移性。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) have shown impressive results in
tasks such as report generation and visual question answering, but they still
face several limitations. Most notably, they underutilize patient metadata and
lack integration of clinical diagnostic knowledge. Moreover, most existing
models are typically trained from scratch or fine-tuned on large-scale 2D
image-text pairs, requiring extensive computational resources, and their
effectiveness on 3D medical imaging is often limited due to the absence of
structural information. To address these gaps, we propose a data-efficient
fine-tuning pipeline to adapt 3D CT-based Med-VLMs for 3D MRI and demonstrate
its application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Our system introduces
two key innovations. First, we convert structured metadata into synthetic
reports, enriching textual input for improved image-text alignment. Second, we
add an auxiliary token trained to predict the mini-mental state examination
(MMSE) score, a widely used clinical measure of cognitive function that
correlates with AD severity. This provides additional supervision for
fine-tuning. Applying lightweight prompt tuning to both image and text
modalities, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two AD
datasets using 1,500 training images, outperforming existing methods fine-tuned
on 10,000 images. Code will be released upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法依赖大量标签数据且表征可解释性差，需要一种能够利用纵向MRI数据时间连续性的自监督学习方法来解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出自监督跨编码器框架，将学习表征解耦为两部分：通过对比学习约束的静态表征（捐捕稳定解剖特征）和通过输入梯度正则化指导的动态表征（反映时间变化）。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上实验显示该方法获得更高的分类准确性和改善的可解释性，并在OASIS数据集上展现出强大的零样本泛化能力，在PPMI数据集上显示交叉任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该自监督框架能够有效地解决神经退行性疾病诊断中的标签数据缺乏和可解释性问题，并展现出良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown significant potential in diagnosing neurodegenerative
diseases from MRI data. However, most existing methods rely heavily on large
volumes of labeled data and often yield representations that lack
interpretability. To address both challenges, we propose a novel
self-supervised cross-encoder framework that leverages the temporal continuity
in longitudinal MRI scans for supervision. This framework disentangles learned
representations into two components: a static representation, constrained by
contrastive learning, which captures stable anatomical features; and a dynamic
representation, guided by input-gradient regularization, which reflects
temporal changes and can be effectively fine-tuned for downstream
classification tasks. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our method achieves
superior classification accuracy and improved interpretability. Furthermore,
the learned representations exhibit strong zero-shot generalization on the Open
Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset and cross-task generalization
on the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) dataset. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 现有语义水印技术虽然能抵御重生攻击，但因频率整体性损失导致检测性能下降，需要解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Hermitian对称式富里叶水印（SFW）方法，通过维护频率整体性；采用中心感知嵌入策略，提升对剪裁攻击的防御能力。

Result: 在多种攻击场景下达到最高检测准确性，同时保持优秀的图像保真度（FID和CLIP分数），超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: SFW框架能有效平衡水印的突出性和图像保真度，解决了语义水印中的本质批扭问题。

Abstract: Semantic watermarking techniques for latent diffusion models (LDMs) are
robust against regeneration attacks, but often suffer from detection
performance degradation due to the loss of frequency integrity. To tackle this
problem, we propose a novel embedding method called Hermitian Symmetric Fourier
Watermarking (SFW), which maintains frequency integrity by enforcing Hermitian
symmetry. Additionally, we introduce a center-aware embedding strategy that
reduces the vulnerability of semantic watermarking due to cropping attacks by
ensuring robust information retention. To validate our approach, we apply these
techniques to existing semantic watermarking schemes, enhancing their
frequency-domain structures for better robustness and retrieval accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art
verification and identification performance, surpassing previous approaches
across various attack scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the impact of SFW on
detection capabilities, the effectiveness of the center-aware embedding against
cropping, and how message capacity influences identification accuracy. Notably,
our method achieves the highest detection accuracy while maintaining superior
image fidelity, as evidenced by FID and CLIP scores. Conclusively, our proposed
SFW is shown to be an effective framework for balancing robustness and image
fidelity, addressing the inherent trade-offs in semantic watermarking. Code

Result: 在两个高度不同的挑战性任务（多帧红外小目标检测和空间目标检测）上实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 该方法证明了在复杂环境中进行小目标检测的有效性和泛化能力，无需对目标特征做出强假设

Abstract: Small moving target detection is crucial for many defense applications but
remains highly challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, ambiguous visual
cues, and cluttered backgrounds. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning
framework that differs fundamentally from existing approaches, which often rely
on target-specific features or motion cues and tend to lack robustness in
complex environments. Our key insight is that small target detection and
background discrimination are inherently coupled, even cluttered video
backgrounds often exhibit strong low-rank structures that can serve as stable
priors for detection. We reformulate the task as a tensor-based low-rank and
sparse decomposition problem and conduct a theoretical analysis of the
background, target, and noise components to guide model design. Building on
these insights, we introduce TenRPCANet, a deep neural network that requires
minimal assumptions about target characteristics. Specifically, we propose a
tokenization strategy that implicitly enforces multi-order tensor low-rank
priors through a self-attention mechanism. This mechanism captures both local
and non-local self-similarity to model the low-rank background without relying
on explicit iterative optimization. In addition, inspired by the sparse
component update in tensor RPCA, we design a feature refinement module to
enhance target saliency. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two highly distinct and challenging tasks: multi-frame infrared
small target detection and space object detection. These results demonstrate
both the effectiveness and the generalizability of our approach.

Conclusion: 该方法在处理深度差异场景方面表现出色，具有强泛化能力，在多个数据集上优于之前的深度学习方法，实现了效率与精度的双重提升

Abstract: Previous deep image registration methods that employ single homography,
multi-grid homography, or thin-plate spline often struggle with real scenes
containing depth disparities due to their inherent limitations. To address
this, we propose an Exponential-Decay Free-Form Deformation Network (EDFFDNet),
which employs free-form deformation with an exponential-decay basis function.
This design achieves higher efficiency and performs well in scenes with depth
disparities, benefiting from its inherent locality. We also introduce an
Adaptive Sparse Motion Aggregator (ASMA), which replaces the MLP motion
aggregator used in previous methods. By transforming dense interactions into
sparse ones, ASMA reduces parameters and improves accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a progressive correlation refinement strategy that leverages
global-local correlation patterns for coarse-to-fine motion estimation, further
enhancing efficiency and accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that EDFFDNet
reduces parameters, memory, and total runtime by 70.5%, 32.6%, and 33.7%,
respectively, while achieving a 0.5 dB PSNR gain over the state-of-the-art
method. With an additional local refinement stage,EDFFDNet-2 further improves
PSNR by 1.06 dB while maintaining lower computational costs. Our method also
demonstrates strong generalization ability across datasets, outperforming
previous deep learning methods.

Abstract: Visual reasoning over structured data such as tables is a critical capability
for modern vision-language models (VLMs), yet current benchmarks remain limited

across distinct roles: generation, validation, and inspiration. Visual-TableQA
comprises 2.5k richly structured LaTeX-rendered tables and 6k
reasoning-intensive QA pairs, all produced at a cost of under USD 100. To
promote diversity and creativity, our pipeline performs multi-model
collaborative data generation via cross-model prompting ('inspiration') and
LLM-jury filtering. Stronger models seed layouts and topics that weaker models
elaborate, collectively distilling diverse reasoning patterns and visual
structures into the dataset. Empirical results show that models fine-tuned on

Method: 提出一种对抗训练框架，通过在特征空间中抑制清洁和对抗样本的类间依赖性来减少类间近似性，具体包括识别每个对抗样本的最近类间邻居并移除其投影

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和SVHN标准数据集上进行的广泛实验显示，该方法在对抗性和清洁准确率方面都取得了显著成就，与领先的对抗训练技术相竞争

Conclusion: 研究结果显示了显式处理类间特征近似性对提升深度神经网络对抗性的重要性

Abstract: Deep neural networks have exhibited impressive performance in image
classification tasks but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. Standard
adversarial training enhances robustness but typically fails to explicitly
address inter-class feature overlap, a significant contributor to adversarial
susceptibility. In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial training
framework that actively mitigates inter-class proximity by projecting out
inter-class dependencies from adversarial and clean samples in the feature
space. Specifically, our approach first identifies the nearest inter-class
neighbors for each adversarial sample and subsequently removes projections onto
these neighbors to enforce stronger feature separability. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that our proposed logits correction reduces the Lipschitz constant
of neural networks, thereby lowering the Rademacher complexity, which directly
contributes to improved generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments
across standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN show that
our method demonstrates strong performance that is competitive with leading
adversarial training techniques, highlighting significant achievements in both
robust and clean accuracy. Our findings reveal the importance of addressing
inter-class feature proximity explicitly to bolster adversarial robustness in
DNNs.

<details>

Motivation: 现有开源方法推理模式单调且交互轮次有限，无法处理需要试错探索的困难任务，因此需要开发能够进行深度多轮推理的系统。

Method: 1)构建Visual Probe Dataset包含数千个挑战性视觉搜索问题；2)开发迭代数据收集管道获取多样化推理模式；3)提出over-turn masking策略在强化学习中避免惩罚超轮次响应。

Result: 尽管训练时只使用最多6轮交互，模型在推理时能自然扩展到数十轮，且准确率随轮次增加而提升，在挑战性视觉搜索问题上表现出色。

Conclusion: Mini-o3能够产生丰富的推理模式和深度思考路径，有效解决复杂视觉搜索问题，展示了大规模工具交互和深度多轮推理的价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models have leveraged image-based tools
with reinforcement learning to tackle visual problems. However, existing
open-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow
only a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for
difficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we
address this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce
Mini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of
steps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search
tasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key
components. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of
thousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory
reasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain
cold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including
depth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an
over-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses
(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,
thereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite
training with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates
trajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with
accuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking
paths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems.

Conclusion: 通过结合代理和critic的方法，成功地将现有视频感知能力应用于更复杂的视频推理任务，为长视频复杂推理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Video understanding has seen significant progress in recent years, with
models' performance on perception from short clips continuing to rise. Yet,
multiple recent benchmarks, such as LVBench, Neptune, and ActivityNet-RTL, show
performance wanes for tasks requiring complex reasoning on videos as queries
grow more complex and videos grow longer. In this work, we ask: can existing
perception capabilities be leveraged to successfully perform more complex video
reasoning? In particular, we develop a large language model agent given access
to video modules as subagents or tools. Rather than following a fixed procedure
to solve queries as in previous work such as Visual Programming, ViperGPT, and
MoReVQA, the agent uses the results of each call to a module to determine
subsequent steps. Inspired by work in the textual reasoning domain, we
introduce a critic to distinguish between instances of successful and
unsuccessful sequences from the agent. We show that the combination of our
agent and critic achieve strong performance on the previously-mentioned
datasets.

distribution of pixel values across the entire image, which limits their
ability to capture the diverse statistical characteristics of different
semantic regions. To overcome this limitation, we propose Segmentation-Assisted
Multi-Entropy Models for Lossless Image Compression (SEEC). Our framework
utilizes semantic segmentation to guide the selection and adaptation of
multiple entropy models, enabling more accurate probability distribution
estimation for distinct semantic regions. Specifically, SEEC first extracts
image features and then applies semantic segmentation to identify different
regions, each assigned a specialized entropy model to better capture its unique
statistical properties. Finally, a multi-channel discrete logistic mixture
likelihood is employed to model the pixel value distributions effectively.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEEC achieves
state-of-the-art compression ratios while introducing only minimal encoding and
decoding latency. With superior performance, the proposed model also supports
Regions of Interest (ROIs) coding condition on the provided segmentation mask.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中风是全球第二大死因，复发率高且死亡率极高（40%），需要方法提前识别高风险患者以降低复发率

Method: 收集3D脱外CTA图像数据，记录心脏疾病、年龄、性别等临床数据，训练单模态和多模态深度学习模型，进行二类分类（Task 1）和生存分析预测（Task 2）

Result: 单纯表格数据在二类分类任务中AUC达0.84；多模态XSRD-net在生存分析任务中c-index达0.68，AUC为0.71，视觉数据占比0.68贡献度

Conclusion: 研究发现心脏疾病（表格数据）和颈动脉（图像数据）之间存在联系，这是预测中风复发的关键因素，需要继续收集数据以加强这一发现

Abstract: Stroke is the second most frequent cause of death world wide with an annual
mortality of around 5.5 million. Recurrence rates of stroke are between 5 and
25% in the first year. As mortality rates for relapses are extraordinarily high
(40%) it is of utmost importance to reduce the recurrence rates. We address
this issue by detecting patients at risk of stroke recurrence at an early stage
in order to enable appropriate therapy planning. To this end we collected 3D
intracranial CTA image data and recorded concomitant heart diseases, the age
and the gender of stroke patients between 2010 and 2024. We trained single- and
multimodal deep learning based neural networks for binary relapse detection
(Task 1) and for relapse free survival (RFS) time prediction together with a
subsequent classification (Task 2). The separation of relapse from non-relapse
patients (Task 1) could be solved with tabular data (AUC on test dataset:
0.84). However, for the main task, the regression (Task 2), our multimodal
XSRD-net processed the modalities vision:tabular with 0.68:0.32 according to
modality contribution measures. The c-index with respect to relapses for the
multimodal model reached 0.68, and the AUC is 0.71 for the test dataset. Final,
deeper interpretability analysis results could highlight a link between both
heart diseases (tabular) and carotid arteries (vision) for the detection of
relapses and the prediction of the RFS time. This is a central outcome that we
strive to strengthen with ongoing data collection and model retraining.

Motivation: 虚拟现实和数字人体建模应用中需要高质量的头发重建，现有方法常忽略头发线条的连通性和拓扑结构

Method: 多阶段管线：先用可微分高斯柱化器重建详细几何结构，然合并高斯段成连续线条，最后在光度监督下精炼和扩展线条

Conclusion: 该方法为头发重建提供了高效且保持线条连通性的解决方案，在合成和实际数据集上都表现稳健

Abstract: Human hair reconstruction is a challenging problem in computer vision, with
growing importance for applications in virtual reality and digital human
modeling. Recent advances in 3D Gaussians Splatting (3DGS) provide efficient
and explicit scene representations that naturally align with the structure of
hair strands. In this work, we extend the 3DGS framework to enable strand-level
hair geometry reconstruction from multi-view images. Our multi-stage pipeline
first reconstructs detailed hair geometry using a differentiable Gaussian
rasterizer, then merges individual Gaussian segments into coherent strands
through a novel merging scheme, and finally refines and grows the strands under
photometric supervision.
  While existing methods typically evaluate reconstruction quality at the
geometric level, they often neglect the connectivity and topology of hair
strands. To address this, we propose a new evaluation metric that serves as a
proxy for assessing topological accuracy in strand reconstruction. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method robustly handles a wide range of hairstyles and achieves efficient
reconstruction, typically completing within one hour.

TL;DR: RayGaussX在RayGauss基础上进行优化，通过引入体积渲染加速策略、增强光线连贯性和尺度正则化等技术，实现了5-12倍训练加速和50-80倍渲染速度提升，同时提高了视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RayGauss虽然在新视角合成方面达到了最先进的渲染质量，但其计算成本过高，无法在真实场景中实现实时渲染。

Method: 引入体积渲染加速策略（空空间跳过和自适应采样）、增强光线连贯性、尺度正则化减少误报交集，并提出新的致密化准则改善远距离区域密度分布。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上实现了5-12倍训练加速和50-80倍渲染速度提升（FPS），视觉质量提升高达+0.56 dB PSNR。

Conclusion: RayGaussX成功解决了RayGauss的计算效率问题，在保持高质量渲染的同时实现了显著的性能提升，适用于更大场景的实时渲染应用。

Abstract: RayGauss has achieved state-of-the-art rendering quality for novel-view
synthesis on synthetic and indoor scenes by representing radiance and density
fields with irregularly distributed elliptical basis functions, rendered via
volume ray casting using a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH). However, its
computational cost prevents real-time rendering on real-world scenes. Our
approach, RayGaussX, builds on RayGauss by introducing key contributions that
accelerate both training and inference. Specifically, we incorporate volumetric
rendering acceleration strategies such as empty-space skipping and adaptive
sampling, enhance ray coherence, and introduce scale regularization to reduce
false-positive intersections. Additionally, we propose a new densification
criterion that improves density distribution in distant regions, leading to
enhanced graphical quality on larger scenes. As a result, RayGaussX achieves 5x
to 12x faster training and 50x to 80x higher rendering speeds (FPS) on
real-world datasets while improving visual quality by up to +0.56 dB in PSNR.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种自监督的多视角神经网络方法，用于融合两个正交各异性低分辨率碳氢成像图像，实现超分辨率重建，无需高分辨率数据进行训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学碳氢成像中，需要在扫描时间和图像质量之间取得平衡。传统方法需要医生单独分析低分辨率扫描图像，时间消耗大且容易出错。

Method: 设计了一种自监督的多视角神经网络，通过稀疏坐标基函数损失来融合两个正交各异性低分辨率图像，支持任意缩放比例。结合了病人无关的离线阶段和病人特异的在线阶段。

Result: 在两个独立的碳氢成像数据集上评估，超分辨率性能可与最先进的自监督方法相比或更优。病人特异重建速度提升达10倍，质量保持相同或更好。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不依赖高分辨率数据的情况下，通过融合多个低分辨率扫描实现高效的超分辨率重建，显著提高了医学图像分析的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Acquiring images in high resolution is often a challenging task. Especially
in the medical sector, image quality has to be balanced with acquisition time
and patient comfort. To strike a compromise between scan time and quality for
Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, two anisotropic scans with different
low-resolution (LR) orientations can be acquired. Typically, LR scans are
analyzed individually by radiologists, which is time consuming and can lead to
inaccurate interpretation. To tackle this, we propose a novel approach for
fusing two orthogonal anisotropic LR MR images to reconstruct anatomical
details in a unified representation. Our multi-view neural network is trained
in a self-supervised manner, without requiring corresponding high-resolution
(HR) data. To optimize the model, we introduce a sparse coordinate-based loss,
enabling the integration of LR images with arbitrary scaling. We evaluate our
method on MR images from two independent cohorts. Our results demonstrate
comparable or even improved super-resolution (SR) performance compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised SR methods for different upsampling
scales. By combining a patient-agnostic offline and a patient-specific online
phase, we achieve a substantial speed-up of up to ten times for
patient-specific reconstruction while achieving similar or better SR quality.

TL;DR: SplatFill是一种基于深度引导的3D高斯泼溅场景修复方法，通过联合深度监督和一致性感知精炼，实现了最先进的感知质量和更高的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅技术虽然能够从多视角图像创建逼真的3D场景表示，但在修复因遮挡或场景编辑导致的缺失区域时仍存在挑战，往往导致模糊细节、伪影和几何不一致的问题。

Method: 结合两个关键思想：(1)联合深度基础和对象基础的监督，确保修复的高斯点在3D空间中准确定位并与周围几何对齐；(2)提出一致性感知精炼方案，选择性识别和修正不一致区域而不破坏场景其他部分。

Result: 在SPIn-NeRF数据集上的评估显示，SplatFill不仅在视觉保真度上超越了现有的NeRF基础和3DGS基础的修复方法，还将训练时间减少了24.5%。定性结果显示该方法能提供更清晰的细节、更少的伪影，并在具有挑战性的视角下具有更好的一致性。

Conclusion: SplatFill通过深度引导和一致性感知精炼，成功解决了3D高斯泼溅场景修复中的关键问题，实现了高质量的修复效果和显著的效率提升。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled the creation of highly realistic 3D
scene representations from sets of multi-view images. However, inpainting
missing regions, whether due to occlusion or scene editing, remains a
challenging task, often leading to blurry details, artifacts, and inconsistent
geometry. In this work, we introduce SplatFill, a novel depth-guided approach
for 3DGS scene inpainting that achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality and
improved efficiency. Our method combines two key ideas: (1) joint depth-based
and object-based supervision to ensure inpainted Gaussians are accurately
placed in 3D space and aligned with surrounding geometry, and (2) we propose a
consistency-aware refinement scheme that selectively identifies and corrects
inconsistent regions without disrupting the rest of the scene. Evaluations on
the SPIn-NeRF dataset demonstrate that SplatFill not only surpasses existing
NeRF-based and 3DGS-based inpainting methods in visual fidelity but also
reduces training time by 24.5%. Qualitative results show our method delivers
sharper details, fewer artifacts, and greater coherence across challenging
viewpoints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型(LLM)处理3D点云时的表示不对齐问题：LLM处理高层语义标记，而3D点云仅包含密集几何结构，这种不对齐限制了输入输出的有效性

Method: 提出Point Linguist Model (PLM)框架，包含：1) Object-centric Discriminative Representation (OcDR)学习对象中心标记，捕获目标语义和场景关系；2) Geometric Reactivation Decoder (GRD)结合OcDR标记和密集特征进行精确分割

Result: 在ScanNetv2上提升+7.3 mIoU，在Multi3DRefer上提升+6.0 mIoU，在7个基准测试的4个不同任务中均取得一致性能提升

Conclusion: PLM通过全面的对象中心推理有效解决了3D理解中的表示对齐问题，证明了该方法在鲁棒3D理解中的有效性

Abstract: 3D object segmentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a
prevailing paradigm due to its broad semantics, task flexibility, and strong
generalization. However, this paradigm is hindered by representation
misalignment: LLMs process high-level semantic tokens, whereas 3D point clouds
convey only dense geometric structures. In prior methods, misalignment limits
both input and output. At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy
pre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar
distractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features
without explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To
address these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general
framework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point
clouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or
3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative
Representation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target
semantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective.
This mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances
resilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within
LLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation
Decoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying
LLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving
comprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline. Extensive experiments
show that PLM achieves significant improvements of +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and
+6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains
across 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness
of comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding.

presents a novel approach to automated burned area mapping using the AlphaEArth
dataset combined with the Siamese U-Net deep learning architecture. The
AlphaEArth Dataset, comprising high-resolution optical and thermal infrared

ecosystems with complex background, showing particular strength in detecting
partially burned vegetation and fire boundaries and its transferability and
high generalization in burned area mapping. This research contributes to the
advancement of automated fire damage assessment and provides a scalable

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在图像描述和视觉问答中容易产生与视觉输入冲突的幻觉，现有方法无法准确定位问题层，需要更精细的注意力诊断和修正机制。

Method: 提出Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE)诊断异常层和Image Attention Focus (IAF)评分注意力头，并基于此开发Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF)方法，在推理时动态定位和修正错误。

Result: 在标准图像描述基准上相对改进53%，VQA任务准确率和F1分数均提升约4%，显著抑制幻觉同时保持效率。

Conclusion: LIAE和IAF能有效定位问题层和头，D-LEAF方法能动态修正注意力错误，大幅减少MLLMs的幻觉现象，且计算开销极小。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on tasks
like image captioning and visual question answering, but remain prone to
hallucinations, where generated text conflicts with the visual input. Prior
work links this partly to insufficient visual attention, but existing
attention-based detectors and mitigation typically apply uniform adjustments
across layers and heads, obscuring where errors originate. In this paper, we
first show these methods fail to accurately localize problematic layers. Then,
we introduce two diagnostics: Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE) which flags
anomalous layers, and Image Attention Focus (IAF) which scores attention heads
within those layers. Analysis shows that LIAE pinpoints faulty layers and IAF
reliably ranks heads that warrant correction. Guided by these signals, we
propose Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF), a
task-agnostic, attention-guided method that dynamically localizes and corrects
errors during inference with negligible overhead. Results show our D-LEAF
delivers a 53% relative improvement on standard captioning benchmarks, and on
VQA both accuracy and F1-score improve by approximately 4%, substantially
suppressing hallucinations while preserving efficiency.

Abstract: Active Membership Inference Test (aMINT) is a method designed to detect
whether given data were used during the training of machine learning models. In
Active MINT, we propose a novel multitask learning process that involves
training simultaneously two models: the original or Audited Model, and a
secondary model, referred to as the MINT Model, responsible for identifying the
data used for training the Audited Model. This novel multi-task learning
approach has been designed to incorporate the auditability of the model as an
optimization objective during the training process of neural networks. The
proposed approach incorporates intermediate activation maps as inputs to the
MINT layers, which are trained to enhance the detection of training data. We
present results using a wide range of neural networks, from lighter
architectures such as MobileNet to more complex ones such as Vision
Transformers, evaluated in 5 public benchmarks. Our proposed Active MINT
achieves over 80% accuracy in detecting if given data was used for training,
significantly outperforming previous approaches in the literature. Our aMINT
and related methodological developments contribute to increasing transparency
in AI models, facilitating stronger safeguards in AI deployments to achieve
proper security, privacy, and copyright protection.

Motivation: 现有方法主要建立支持目标对象与整个查询图像之间的图像级相关性，但这种相关性包含难以追踪和抑制的硬像素噪声（无关背景对象），导致背景过拟合。

Method: 设计对象级相关性网络（OCNet），包含通用对象挖掘模块（GOMM）和相关性构建模块（CCM）。GOMM通过学习显著性和高层相似性线索构建查询通用对象特征，CCM通过分配目标原型来匹配通用对象特征建立对象级相关性。

Result: 在PASCAL-5i和COCO-20i数据集上的大量实验表明，该模型达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过模仿生物视觉过程，在对象级信息中识别新对象，建立对象级相关性可以挖掘查询目标特征并抑制硬像素噪声，从而有效解决少样本语义分割中的背景过拟合问题。

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to segment objects of novel
categories in the query images given only a few annotated support samples.
Existing methods primarily build the image-level correlation between the
support target object and the entire query image. However, this correlation
contains the hard pixel noise, \textit{i.e.}, irrelevant background objects,
that is intractable to trace and suppress, leading to the overfitting of the
background. To address the limitation of this correlation, we imitate the
biological vision process to identify novel objects in the object-level
information. Target identification in the general objects is more valid than in
the entire image, especially in the low-data regime. Inspired by this, we
design an Object-level Correlation Network (OCNet) by establishing the
object-level correlation between the support target object and query general
objects, which is mainly composed of the General Object Mining Module (GOMM)
and Correlation Construction Module (CCM). Specifically, GOMM constructs the
query general object feature by learning saliency and high-level similarity
cues, where the general objects include the irrelevant background objects and
the target foreground object. Then, CCM establishes the object-level
correlation by allocating the target prototypes to match the general object
feature. The generated object-level correlation can mine the query target
feature and suppress the hard pixel noise for the final prediction. Extensive
experiments on PASCAL-${5}^{i}$ and COCO-${20}^{i}$ show that our model
achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Joint reconstruction of human-object interaction marks a significant
milestone in comprehending the intricate interrelations between humans and
their surrounding environment. Nevertheless, previous optimization methods
often struggle to achieve physically plausible reconstruction results due to
the lack of prior knowledge about human-object interactions. In this paper, we
introduce ScoreHOI, an effective diffusion-based optimizer that introduces
diffusion priors for the precise recovery of human-object interactions. By
harnessing the controllability within score-guided sampling, the diffusion
model can reconstruct a conditional distribution of human and object pose given
the image observation and object feature. During inference, the ScoreHOI
effectively improves the reconstruction results by guiding the denoising
process with specific physical constraints. Furthermore, we propose a
contact-driven iterative refinement approach to enhance the contact
plausibility and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Extensive evaluations on
standard benchmarks demonstrate ScoreHOI's superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its ability to achieve a precise and
robust improvement in joint human-object interaction reconstruction.

Conclusion: ToothMCL为数字牙科提供了一个高效的预训练框架，能够准确分割牙齿并识别FDI牙位编号，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Digital dentistry represents a transformative shift in modern dental
practice. The foundational step in this transformation is the accurate digital
representation of the patient's dentition, which is obtained from segmented
Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scans (IOS). Despite the
growing interest in digital dental technologies, existing segmentation
methodologies frequently lack rigorous validation and demonstrate limited
performance and clinical applicability. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to introduce a multimodal pretraining framework for tooth
segmentation. We present ToothMCL, a Tooth Multimodal Contrastive Learning for
pretraining that integrates volumetric (CBCT) and surface-based (IOS)
modalities. By capturing modality-invariant representations through multimodal
contrastive learning, our approach effectively models fine-grained anatomical
features, enabling precise multi-class segmentation and accurate identification
of F\'ed\'eration Dentaire Internationale (FDI) tooth numbering. Along with the
framework, we curated CBCT-IOS3.8K, the largest paired CBCT and IOS dataset to
date, comprising 3,867 patients. We then evaluated ToothMCL on a comprehensive
collection of independent datasets, representing the largest and most diverse
evaluation to date. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
internal and external testing, with an increase of 12\% for CBCT segmentation
and 8\% for IOS segmentation in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).
Furthermore, ToothMCL consistently surpasses existing approaches in tooth
groups and demonstrates robust generalizability across varying imaging
conditions and clinical scenarios.

Abstract: As local AI grows in popularity, there is a critical gap between the
benchmark performance of object detectors and their practical viability on
consumer-grade hardware. While models like YOLOv10s promise real-time speeds,
these metrics are typically achieved on high-power, desktop-class GPUs. This
paper reveals that on resource-constrained systems, such as laptops with RTX
4060 GPUs, performance is not compute-bound but is instead dominated by
system-level bottlenecks, as illustrated by a simple bottleneck test. To
overcome this hardware-level constraint, we introduce a Two-Pass Adaptive
Inference algorithm, a model-independent approach that requires no
architectural changes. This study mainly focuses on adaptive inference
strategies and undertakes a comparative analysis of architectural early-exit
and resolution-adaptive routing, highlighting their respective trade-offs
within a unified evaluation framework. The system uses a fast, low-resolution
pass and only escalates to a high-resolution model pass when detection
confidence is low. On a 5000-image COCO dataset, our method achieves a 1.85x
speedup over a PyTorch Early-Exit baseline, with a modest mAP loss of 5.51%.
This work provides a practical and reproducible blueprint for deploying
high-performance, real-time AI on consumer-grade devices by shifting the focus
from pure model optimization to hardware-aware inference strategies that
maximize throughput.

Motivation: 为了支持在轨服务和活性岞埃移除任务中对未合作空间物体的形状和运动特性进行评估，需要解决轮转目标重建的挑战。

Method: 使用Isaac Sim开发了一个模拟环境，生成物理准确的2D图像序列，并使用Neuralangelo算法进行静态场景的3D重建。

Abstract: Characterization of uncooperative Resident Space Objects (RSO) play a crucial
role in On-Orbit Servicing (OOS) and Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions to
assess the geometry and motion properties. To address the challenges of
reconstructing tumbling uncooperative targets, this study evaluates the
performance of existing state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction algorithms for
dynamic scenes, focusing on their ability to generate geometrically accurate
models with high-fidelity. To support our evaluation, we developed a simulation
environment using Isaac Sim to generate physics-accurate 2D image sequences of
tumbling satellite under realistic orbital lighting conditions. Our preliminary
results on static scenes using Neuralangelo demonstrate promising
reconstruction quality. The generated 3D meshes closely match the original CAD
models with minimal errors and artifacts when compared using Cloud Compare
(CC). The reconstructed models were able to capture critical fine details for
mission planning. This provides a baseline for our ongoing evaluation of
dynamic scene reconstruction.

<details>

Motivation: 深度神经网络内部特征提取过程的黑盒性质是关键问题，需要方法来分析和解释DNN的特征空间

Method: 使用导向漫散模型实现解码器，在每个反向图像生成步骤中最小化清洁图像估计特征与用户指定特征的欧几里得距离

Result: 实验结果显示，解码器生成的图像特征与用户指定特征龚异相似，并揭示了CLIP图像编码器、ResNet-50和视觉Transformer等DNN特征空间的有价值洞察

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练即可分析不同DNN的特征空间，在单个商用GPU上运行，为解释DNN黑盒提供了实用工具

Abstract: One of the key issues in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the black-box nature
of their internal feature extraction process. Targeting vision-related domains,
this paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a
decoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match
a user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past
studies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various attributes in an
image are encoded into a feature by the DNN, by generating images whose
features are in proximity to that feature. Our decoder is implemented as a
guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a
pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the
feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature.
One practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of
different DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The
experimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision
transformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features
remarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into
these DNNs' feature spaces.

TL;DR: OnePoseViaGen是一个用于单次参考图像下任意未见物体的6D姿态估计的先进方法，通过粗到精对齐和文本引导的生成域随机化技术，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人操作中罕见物体的6D姿态估计问题，传统方法面临3D模型稀缺、单视图重建缺乏度量尺度以及生成模型与真实图像之间的域差距等挑战。

Method: 采用两个关键组件：1）粗到精对齐模块，结合多视图特征匹配和渲染比较细化来联合优化尺度和姿态；2）文本引导的生成域随机化策略，通过多样化纹理实现合成数据上的有效微调。

Result: 在YCBInEOAT、Toyota-Light、LM-O等挑战性基准测试中达到最先进性能，远超先前方法，并在真实机器人手上展示了稳健的灵巧抓取能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过高保真单视图3D生成支持可靠的单次6D姿态估计，验证了在实际操作中的实用性，为机器人处理现实世界中的长尾实例提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of arbitrary unseen objects from a single reference
image is critical for robotics operating in the long-tail of real-world
instances. However, this setting is notoriously challenging: 3D models are
rarely available, single-view reconstructions lack metric scale, and domain
gaps between generated models and real-world images undermine robustness. We
propose OnePoseViaGen, a pipeline that tackles these challenges through two key
components. First, a coarse-to-fine alignment module jointly refines scale and
pose by combining multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare
refinement. Second, a text-guided generative domain randomization strategy
diversifies textures, enabling effective fine-tuning of pose estimators with
synthetic data. Together, these steps allow high-fidelity single-view 3D
generation to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation. On challenging
benchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O), OnePoseViaGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance far surpassing prior approaches. We further
demonstrate robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand, validating the
practicality of our method in real-world manipulation. Project page:

TL;DR: VIRAL是一种通过视觉表示对齐来增强多模态大语言模型视觉推理能力的正则化策略，将MLLM的内部视觉表示与预训练视觉基础模型对齐，保留关键视觉细节并补充额外视觉知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在视觉中心任务（如目标计数、空间推理）上表现有限，主要原因是文本监督范式只能提供视觉通路的间接指导，导致训练过程中丢失细粒度视觉细节。

Method: 提出VIRAL正则化策略，将MLLM的内部视觉表示与预训练视觉基础模型（VFMs）的表示进行显式对齐，使模型既能保留输入视觉编码器的关键视觉细节，又能补充VFMs的额外视觉知识。

Result: 实验表明该方法在广泛采用的多模态基准测试的所有任务上都取得了持续改进，并通过全面的消融研究验证了关键设计选择的有效性。

Conclusion: 这一简单发现为在MLLM训练中有效整合视觉信息开辟了重要方向，通过视觉表示对齐可以显著提升模型处理复杂视觉输入的能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction
tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain
limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning.
We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which
provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to
discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present
VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization
strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of
pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this
alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details
from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual
knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex
visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all
tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying
our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction
for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.

Motivation: 多准则决策方法需要有效处理决策者判断中的不确定性和模糊性，特别是在可再生能源选择这种具有技术、管理和政治复杂性的问题上。Fermatean模糊环境能够更好地量化人类思维和感知中的不确定性。

Method: 采用Fermatean模糊环境作为模糊集的推广，提出基于偏差最大化方法的优化模型来确定部分已知特征权重，并结合区间值Fermatean模糊集。

Result: 该方法成功应用于可再生能源选择问题，能够处理决策过程中的不确定性和模糊判断。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为复杂决策问题提供了有效的工具，特别是在处理可再生能源选择这种具有多重不确定性和利益冲突的决策场景时表现出良好的适用性。

Abstract: Multi-criteria decision-making methods provide decision-makers with
appropriate tools to make better decisions in uncertain, complex, and
conflicting situations. Fuzzy set theory primarily deals with the uncertainty
inherent in human thoughts and perceptions and attempts to quantify this
uncertainty. Fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory are utilized with multi-criteria
decision-making methods because they effectively handle uncertainty and
fuzziness in decision-makers' judgments, allowing for verbal judgments of the
problem. This study utilizes the Fermatean fuzzy environment, a generalization
of fuzzy sets. An optimization model based on the deviation maximization method
is proposed to determine partially known feature weights. This method is
combined with interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets. The proposed method was
applied to the problem of selecting renewable energy sources. The reason for
choosing renewable energy sources is that meeting energy needs from renewable
sources, balancing carbon emissions, and mitigating the effects of global
climate change are among the most critical issues of the recent period. Even
though selecting renewable energy sources is a technical issue, the managerial
and political implications of this issue are also important, and are discussed
in this study.

TL;DR: Spectral NSR是一个完全频谱的神经符号推理框架，通过图信号处理和拉普拉斯特征结构将逻辑规则嵌入为频谱模板，在频谱域直接进行推理，统一了符号推理的可解释性和频谱学习的可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经符号方法在可扩展性和适应性方面存在局限，需要一种能够结合符号推理可解释性和神经网络学习能力的新框架。

Method: 利用图信号处理和基于知识图谱拉普拉斯特征结构的频率选择性滤波器，嵌入逻辑规则作为频谱模板，包含动态图学习、有理和扩散滤波器、频谱专家混合、证明引导训练等多种扩展技术。

Result: 在ProofWriter和CLUTRR等推理基准测试中，Spectral NSR相比transformer、消息传递神经网络等基线方法，实现了更高的准确性、更快的推理速度、更好的对抗鲁棒性和更强的可解释性。

Conclusion: Spectral NSR为下一代推理系统提供了可扩展的原则性基础，提供了超越传统方法的透明度、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce Spectral NSR, a fully spectral neuro-symbolic reasoning
framework that embeds logical rules as spectral templates and performs
inference directly in the graph spectral domain. By leveraging graph signal
processing (GSP) and frequency-selective filters grounded in the Laplacian
eigenstructure of knowledge graphs, the architecture unifies the
interpretability of symbolic reasoning with the scalability and adaptability of
spectral learning. Beyond the core formulation, we incorporate a comprehensive
set of extensions, including dynamic graph and basis learning, rational and
diffusion filters for sharper spectral selectivity, mixture-of-spectral-experts
for modular specialization, proof-guided training with spectral curricula, and
uncertainty quantification for calibrated confidence. Additional enhancements
such as large language model coupling, co-spectral transfer alignment,
adversarial robustness, efficient GPU kernels, generalized Laplacians, and
causal interventions further expand the versatility of the framework.
  Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning benchmarks such as
ProofWriter and CLUTRR demonstrates that Spectral NSR achieves superior
accuracy, faster inference, improved robustness to adversarial perturbations,
and higher interpretability compared to leading baselines including
transformers, message-passing neural networks, and neuro-symbolic logic
programming systems. Spectral attribution and proof-band agreement analyses
confirm that model decisions align closely with symbolic proof structures,
while transfer experiments validate effective domain adaptation through
co-spectral alignment. These results establish Spectral NSR as a scalable and
principled foundation for the next generation of reasoning systems, offering
transparency, robustness, and generalization beyond conventional approaches.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence is emerging as an important technology,
promising to be transformative in many areas. At the same time, generative AI
techniques are based on sampling from probabilistic models, and by default,
they come with no guarantees about correctness, safety, fairness, or other

the reliability of generative AI techniques. In addition, statistical methods
are also promising for improving the quality and efficiency of AI evaluation,
as well as for designing interventions and experiments in AI.
  In this paper, we review some of the existing work on these topics,
explaining both the general statistical techniques used, as well as their
applications to generative AI. We also discuss limitations and potential future

Method: 基于单次专家演示提取步骤指令，严格遵循用户轨迹执行，并配备验证器和回溯器模块来处理意外中断和验证执行结果。

Result: 在OSWorld测试集上实现了60%的成功率，所有顶级代理此前都无法完成这些任务。

Conclusion: Instruction Agent提供了一个实用且可扩展的框架，弥合了当前GUI代理与可靠真实世界GUI任务自动化之间的差距。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have advanced rapidly but still
struggle with complex tasks involving novel UI elements, long-horizon actions,
and personalized trajectories. In this work, we introduce Instruction Agent, a
GUI agent that leverages expert demonstrations to solve such tasks, enabling
completion of otherwise difficult workflows. Given a single demonstration, the
agent extracts step-by-step instructions and executes them by strictly
following the trajectory intended by the user, which avoids making mistakes
during execution. The agent leverages the verifier and backtracker modules
further to improve robustness. Both modules are critical to understand the
current outcome from each action and handle unexpected interruptions(such as
pop-up windows) during execution. Our experiments show that Instruction Agent
achieves a 60% success rate on a set of tasks in OSWorld that all top-ranked
agents failed to complete. The Instruction Agent offers a practical and
extensible framework, bridging the gap between current GUI agents and reliable
real-world GUI task automation.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) frameworks combine neural representations and learning
with symbolic representations and reasoning. Combining the reasoning
capacities, explainability, and interpretability of symbolic processing with
the flexibility and power of neural computing allows us to solve complex
problems with more reliability while being data-efficient. However, this
recently growing topic poses a challenge to developers with its learning curve,
lack of user-friendly tools, libraries, and unifying frameworks. In this paper,
we characterize the technical facets of existing NeSy frameworks, such as the
symbolic representation language, integration with neural models, and the
underlying algorithms. A majority of the NeSy research focuses on algorithms
instead of providing generic frameworks for declarative problem specification
to leverage problem solving. To highlight the key aspects of Neurosymbolic
modeling, we showcase three generic NeSy frameworks - \textit{DeepProbLog},
\textit{Scallop}, and \textit{DomiKnowS}. We identify the challenges within
each facet that lay the foundation for identifying the expressivity of each
framework in solving a variety of problems. Building on this foundation, we aim
to spark transformative action and encourage the community to rethink this
problem in novel ways.

Motivation: 皮肤神经活动性(SKNA)作为交感神经系统活动的非侵入性指标，但容易受肌电(EMG)干扰，传统滤波方法效果有限

Method: 采用轻量化一维卷积自动编码器网络，结合LSTM瓶颈结构，在离一受试者交叉验证框架下训练模型

Result: 信噪比提高9.65dB，相关系数从0.40提升到0.72，在严重噪声条件下征状识别准确玉达91-98%，接近清洁数据水平

Conclusion: 深度学习方法能有效清除EMG干扰，保持生理学相关的交感神经爆发特征，为自然环境下的SKNA监测提供更稳健的技术支撑

Abstract: The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) plays a central role in regulating the
body's responses to stress and maintaining physiological stability. Its
dysregulation is associated with a wide range of conditions, from
cardiovascular disease to anxiety disorders. Skin nerve activity (SKNA)
extracted from high-frequency electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings provides a
noninvasive window into SNS dynamics, but its measurement is highly susceptible
to electromyographic (EMG) contamination. Traditional preprocessing based on
bandpass filtering within a fixed range (e.g., 500--1000 Hz) is susceptible to
overlapping EMG and SKNA spectral components, especially during sustained
muscle activity. We present a denoising approach using a lightweight
one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder with a long short-term memory (LSTM)
bottleneck to reconstruct clean SKNA from EMG-contaminated recordings. Using
clean ECG-derived SKNA data from cognitive stress experiments and EMG noise
from chaotic muscle stimulation recordings, we simulated contamination at
realistic noise levels (--4 dB, --8 dB signal-to-noise ratio) and trained the
model in the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation framework. The method
improved signal-to-noise ratio by up to 9.65 dB, increased cross correlation
with clean SKNA from 0.40 to 0.72, and restored burst-based SKNA features to
near-clean discriminability (AUROC $\geq$ 0.96). Classification of baseline
versus sympathetic stimulation (cognitive stress) conditions reached accuracies
of 91--98\% across severe noise levels, comparable to clean data. These results
demonstrate that deep learning--based reconstruction can preserve
physiologically relevant sympathetic bursts during substantial EMG
interference, enabling more robust SKNA monitoring in naturalistic,
movement-rich environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Text-to-SQL方法在工业级数据库和涉及领域特定业务逻辑的复杂问题上执行准确率较低，需要更可靠的解决方案。

Method: 采用两种管道：(1) 基于大语言模型的上下文学习框架和群体自评估（语言RL）；(2) 基于小模型（OmniSQL-7B）的思维链RL管道，使用特殊设计的奖励函数和两阶段RL训练。

Result: 在Spider、Spider 2.0和BIRD基准测试中达到SOTA，其中在Spider2.0-SQLite上语言RL管道比SOTA高7.4%，CoT管道高1.4%。混合SQL方言训练带来三倍增益。

Conclusion: PaVeRL-SQL在现实工业约束下提供了可靠、SOTA级别的Text-to-SQL解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL models allow users to interact with a database more easily by
generating executable SQL statements from natural-language questions. Despite
recent successes on simpler databases and questions, current Text-to-SQL
methods still suffer from low execution accuracy on industry-scale databases
and complex questions involving domain-specific business logic. We present
\emph{PaVeRL-SQL}, a framework that combines \emph{Partial-Match Rewards} and
\emph{Verbal Reinforcement Learning} to drive self-improvement in reasoning
language models (RLMs) for Text-to-SQL. To handle practical use cases, we adopt
two pipelines: (1) a newly designed in-context learning framework with group
self-evaluation (verbal-RL), using capable open- and closed-source large
language models (LLMs) as backbones; and (2) a chain-of-thought (CoT) RL
pipeline with a small backbone model (OmniSQL-7B) trained with a specially
designed reward function and two-stage RL. These pipelines achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on popular Text-to-SQL benchmarks -- Spider,
Spider 2.0, and BIRD. For the industrial-level Spider2.0-SQLite benchmark, the
verbal-RL pipeline achieves an execution accuracy 7.4\% higher than SOTA, and
the CoT pipeline is 1.4\% higher. RL training with mixed SQL dialects yields
strong, threefold gains, particularly for dialects with limited training data.
Overall, \emph{PaVeRL-SQL} delivers reliable, SOTA Text-to-SQL under realistic
industrial constraints. The code is available at

Motivation: 每年数百万人通过法律援助热线、办公室或律师转介服务寻求法律帮助，错误分类可能导致严重后果（错过截止日期、遭受虐待、失去住房或子女监护权），需要准确的法律问题分类系统。

Method: 采用混合LLM/ML集成分类方法，结合自动生成后续问题来丰富初始问题叙述，使用包含419个真实查询的新数据集进行训练和评估。

Abstract: Each year millions of people seek help for their legal problems by calling a
legal aid program hotline, walking into a legal aid office, or using a lawyer
referral service. The first step to match them to the right help is to identify
the legal problem the applicant is experiencing. Misdirection has consequences.
Applicants may miss a deadline, experience physical abuse, lose housing or lose
custody of children while waiting to connect to the right legal help. We
introduce and evaluate the FETCH classifier for legal issue classification and
describe two methods for improving accuracy: a hybrid LLM/ML ensemble
classification method, and the automatic generation of follow-up questions to
enrich the initial problem narrative. We employ a novel data set of 419
real-world queries to a nonprofit lawyer referral service. Ultimately, we show
classification accuracy (hits@2) of 97.37\% using a mix of inexpensive models,
exceeding the performance of the current state-of-the-art GPT-5 model. Our
approach shows promise in significantly reducing the cost of guiding users of
the legal system to the right resource for their problem while achieving high
accuracy.

Abstract: The evolution of the traditional power grid into the "smart grid" has
resulted in a fundamental shift in energy management, which allows the
integration of renewable energy sources with modern communication technology.
However, this interconnection has increased smart grids' vulnerability to
attackers, which might result in privacy breaches, operational interruptions,
and massive outages. The SCADA-based smart grid protocols are critical for
real-time data collection and control, but they are vulnerable to attacks like
unauthorized access and denial of service (DoS). This research proposes a
hybrid deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) intended to improve
the cybersecurity of smart grids. The suggested model takes advantage of
Convolutional Neural Networks' (CNN) feature extraction capabilities as well as
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks' temporal pattern recognition skills.
DNP3 and IEC104 intrusion detection datasets are employed to train and test our
CNN-LSTM model to recognize and classify the potential cyber threats. Compared
to other deep learning approaches, the results demonstrate considerable
improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a detection

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非常规气动构型数据稀缺问题，促进数据驱动的气动设计代理建模研究

Method: 通过采样几何设计参数和飞行条件生成数据集，使用PointNet回归器从表面点云预测几何参数，然后通过FiLM网络结合预测参数和飞行条件来预测点状系数

Result: 实验显示在不同BWB构型上表面预测误差较低，数据集包含8830个收敛的RANS案例，每个案例有9-14百万网格单元

Conclusion: BlendedNet为非常规构型提供了宝贵的数据资源，并展示了端到端代理框架在气动预测中的有效性

Abstract: BlendedNet is a publicly available aerodynamic dataset of 999 blended wing
body (BWB) geometries. Each geometry is simulated across about nine flight
conditions, yielding 8830 converged RANS cases with the Spalart-Allmaras model
and 9 to 14 million cells per case. The dataset is generated by sampling
geometric design parameters and flight conditions, and includes detailed
pointwise surface quantities needed to study lift and drag. We also introduce
an end-to-end surrogate framework for pointwise aerodynamic prediction. The
pipeline first uses a permutation-invariant PointNet regressor to predict
geometric parameters from sampled surface point clouds, then conditions a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) network on the predicted parameters and
flight conditions to predict pointwise coefficients Cp, Cfx, and Cfz.
Experiments show low errors in surface predictions across diverse BWBs.
BlendedNet addresses data scarcity for unconventional configurations and
enables research on data-driven surrogate modeling for aerodynamic design.

Motivation: 解决基于大型语言模型的区块链健康监测方案存在的隐私泄露、内存占用高和延迟问题，探索轻量化小型模型在本地运行的可行性。

Method: 系统性评估SLMs在健康预测任务中的表现，采用零样本学习、少样本学习和指令微调等方法，并将最佳模型部署到移动设备上进行实际效能测试。

Abstract: Mobile and wearable healthcare monitoring play a vital role in facilitating
timely interventions, managing chronic health conditions, and ultimately
improving individuals' quality of life. Previous studies on large language
models (LLMs) have highlighted their impressive generalization abilities and
effectiveness in healthcare prediction tasks. However, most LLM-based
healthcare solutions are cloud-based, which raises significant privacy concerns
and results in increased memory usage and latency. To address these challenges,
there is growing interest in compact models, Small Language Models (SLMs),
which are lightweight and designed to run locally and efficiently on mobile and
wearable devices. Nevertheless, how well these models perform in healthcare
prediction remains largely unexplored. We systematically evaluated SLMs on
health prediction tasks using zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction fine-tuning
approaches, and deployed the best performing fine-tuned SLMs on mobile devices
to evaluate their real-world efficiency and predictive performance in practical
healthcare scenarios. Our results show that SLMs can achieve performance
comparable to LLMs while offering substantial gains in efficiency and privacy.
However, challenges remain, particularly in handling class imbalance and
few-shot scenarios. These findings highlight SLMs, though imperfect in their
current form, as a promising solution for next-generation, privacy-preserving
healthcare monitoring.

Motivation: 找出中间令牌生成长度是否真正反映问题难度，证明当前对中间令牌作为"思考"的假设是否正确

Method: 使用A*搜索算法的演绎迹迹训练变换器模型，通过迷宫问题的操作步数准确量化问题复杂度

Result: 模型甚至在简单任务中也会生成过长的推理迹迹，中间令牌长度与真实A*迹迹长度相关性弱，只在训练数据分布附近时才有相关性

Conclusion: 中间迹迹生成并非适应问题难度，而是受训练数据分布影响，不应将长庨序列解释为"思考努力"的表现

Abstract: Intermediate token generation (ITG), where a model produces output before the
solution, has been proposed as a method to improve the performance of language
models on reasoning tasks. While these reasoning traces or Chain of Thoughts
(CoTs) are correlated with performance gains, the mechanisms underlying them
remain unclear. A prevailing assumption in the community has been to
anthropomorphize these tokens as "thinking", treating longer traces as evidence
of higher problem-adaptive computation. In this work, we critically examine
whether intermediate token sequence length reflects or correlates with problem
difficulty. To do so, we train transformer models from scratch on derivational
traces of the A* search algorithm, where the number of operations required to
solve a maze problem provides a precise and verifiable measure of problem
complexity. We first evaluate the models on trivial free-space problems,
finding that even for the simplest tasks, they often produce excessively long
reasoning traces and sometimes fail to generate a solution. We then
systematically evaluate the model on out-of-distribution problems and find that
the intermediate token length and ground truth A* trace length only loosely
correlate. We notice that the few cases where correlation appears are those
where the problems are closer to the training distribution, suggesting that the
effect arises from approximate recall rather than genuine problem-adaptive
computation. This suggests that the inherent computational complexity of the
problem instance is not a significant factor, but rather its distributional
distance from the training data. These results challenge the assumption that
intermediate trace generation is adaptive to problem difficulty and caution
against interpreting longer sequences in systems like R1 as automatically
indicative of "thinking effort".

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代码进化方法（如AlphaEvolve）仅限于数百行代码的孤立内核，无法处理完整代码库规模。需要将LLM代码进化扩展到包含数百个文件和数万行代码的完整仓库级别。

Method: SATLUTION框架协调LLM代理直接进化求解器仓库，在严格正确性保证和分布式运行时反馈下进行，同时自进化其进化策略和规则。基于SAT Competition 2024代码库和基准开始。

Result: SATLUTION进化的求解器在SAT Competition 2025中明显超越了人类设计的冠军，同时在2024基准测试中也超越了2024和2025年的冠军。

Conclusion: SATLUTION成功证明了LLM代码进化可以扩展到完整代码库规模，并在复杂算法问题上超越人类专家水平，为大规模代码自动化进化开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong coding abilities,
enabling not only static code generation but also iterative code self-evolving
through agentic frameworks. Recently, AlphaEvolve \cite{novikov2025alphaevolve}
demonstrated that LLM-based coding agents can autonomously improve algorithms
and surpass human experts, with scopes limited to isolated kernels spanning
hundreds of lines of code. Inspired by AlphaEvolve, we present SATLUTION, the
first framework to extend LLM-based code evolution to the full repository
scale, encompassing hundreds of files and tens of thousands of lines of C/C++
code. Targeting Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), the canonical NP-complete problem
and a cornerstone of both theory and applications. SATLUTION orchestrates LLM
agents to directly evolve solver repositories under strict correctness
guarantees and distributed runtime feedback, while simultaneously self-evolving
its own evolution policies and rules. Starting from SAT Competition 2024
codebases and benchmark, SATLUTION evolved solvers that decisively outperformed
the human-designed winners of the SAT Competition 2025, and also surpassed both
2024 and 2025 champions on the 2024 benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型发展面临的数据依赖瓶颈问题，避免需要不断增加训练数据的需求

Method: 基于博弈论的自博弈框架，将模型能力视为竞争游戏中的表现，通过模型与自己对抗来产生更强策略

Result: 在Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct上的实验表明，仅通过自博弈就能提升指令跟随任务的性能，且效果优于数据驱动的基线方法

Conclusion: 自博弈强化学习是突破语言模型数据依赖瓶颈的有效途径，能够在不增加数据的情况下持续提升模型能力

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by
scale, abundant high-quality training data, and reinforcement learning. Yet
this progress faces a fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from
which models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose a reinforcement
learning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve
without additional data. Our method leverages a game-theoretic framework of
self-play, where a model's capabilities are cast as performance in a
competitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against
itself - a process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following benchmarks show that pretrained
models can not only enhance their performance on challenging tasks through
self-play alone, but can also do so more effectively than data-driven
baselines.

Abstract: Spreadsheets are critical to data-centric tasks, with rich, structured
layouts that enable efficient information transmission. Given the time and
expertise required for manual spreadsheet layout design, there is an urgent
need for automated solutions. However, existing automated layout models are
ill-suited to spreadsheets, as they often (1) treat components as axis-aligned
rectangles with continuous coordinates, overlooking the inherently discrete,
grid-based structure of spreadsheets; and (2) neglect interrelated semantics,
such as data dependencies and contextual links, unique to spreadsheets. In this
paper, we first formalize the spreadsheet layout generation task, supported by
a seven-criterion evaluation protocol and a dataset of 3,326 spreadsheets. We
then introduce SheetDesigner, a zero-shot and training-free framework using
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that combines rule and vision
reflection for component placement and content population. SheetDesigner
outperforms five baselines by at least 22.6\%. We further find that through
vision modality, MLLMs handle overlap and balance well but struggle with
alignment, necessitates hybrid rule and visual reflection strategies. Our codes
and data is available at Github.

Conclusion: 神经符号方法可以弥合黑盒预测模型与复杂动态环境中关键决策支持需求之间的差距，特别是在工业物联网赋能的网络物理系统中

Abstract: The integration of Deep Learning (DL) in System Dynamics (SD) modeling for
transportation logistics offers significant advantages in scalability and
predictive accuracy. However, these gains are often offset by the loss of
explainability and causal reliability $-$ key requirements in critical
decision-making systems. This paper presents a novel framework for
interpretable-by-design neural system dynamics modeling that synergizes DL with
techniques from Concept-Based Interpretability, Mechanistic Interpretability,
and Causal Machine Learning. The proposed hybrid approach enables the
construction of neural network models that operate on semantically meaningful
and actionable variables, while retaining the causal grounding and transparency
typical of traditional SD models. The framework is conceived to be applied to
real-world case-studies from the EU-funded project AutoMoTIF, focusing on
data-driven decision support, automation, and optimization of multimodal
logistic terminals. We aim at showing how neuro-symbolic methods can bridge the
gap between black-box predictive models and the need for critical decision
support in complex dynamical environments within cyber-physical systems enabled
by the industrial Internet-of-Things.

Method: 构建基于替代模型激活值的能量模型(EBM)评估对抗提示质量，采用标记级Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC)采样进行适应性优化，实现无需梯度的黑盒攻击

Result: 在5个主流LLM上达到49.6%攻击成功率，比人工制作提示提升34.6%，在未见任务场景中保持36.6%的ASR，显示出良好的跨模型转移性

Conclusion: 激活值与攻击效果存在相关性，语义模式在可转移漏洞利用中发挥关键作用，该框架为黑盒直接提示注入攻击提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Direct Prompt Injection (DPI) attacks pose a critical security threat to
Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their low barrier of execution and high
potential damage. To address the impracticality of existing white-box/gray-box
methods and the poor transferability of black-box methods, we propose an
activations-guided prompt injection attack framework. We first construct an
Energy-based Model (EBM) using activations from a surrogate model to evaluate
the quality of adversarial prompts. Guided by the trained EBM, we employ the
token-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to adaptively optimize
adversarial prompts, thereby enabling gradient-free black-box attacks.
Experimental results demonstrate our superior cross-model transferability,
achieving 49.6% attack success rate (ASR) across five mainstream LLMs and 34.6%
improvement over human-crafted prompts, and maintaining 36.6% ASR on unseen
task scenarios. Interpretability analysis reveals a correlation between
activations and attack effectiveness, highlighting the critical role of
semantic patterns in transferable vulnerability exploitation.

Result: 提供了针对组织LLM采用对齐方法的扩展文献分析过程，以及首个LLM对齐问题-解决方案空间

Conclusion: LLM ATLAS框架能够在组织LLM采用过程中有效缓解对齐问题，补充了现有研究在组织信息不对称方面的空白

Abstract: Adopting Large language models (LLMs) in organizations potentially
revolutionizes our lives and work. However, they can generate off-topic,
discriminating, or harmful content. This AI alignment problem often stems from
misspecifications during the LLM adoption, unnoticed by the principal due to
the LLM's black-box nature. While various research disciplines investigated AI
alignment, they neither address the information asymmetries between
organizational adopters and black-box LLM agents nor consider organizational AI
adoption processes. Therefore, we propose LLM ATLAS (LLM Agency Theory-Led
Alignment Strategy) a conceptual framework grounded in agency (contract)
theory, to mitigate alignment problems during organizational LLM adoption. We
conduct a conceptual literature analysis using the organizational LLM adoption
phases and the agency theory as concepts. Our approach results in (1) providing
an extended literature analysis process specific to AI alignment methods during
organizational LLM adoption and (2) providing a first LLM alignment
problem-solution space.

TL;DR: DeepGraphLog是一个新型神经符号AI框架，通过图神经网络谓词扩展ProbLog，支持多层神经符号推理，能够处理图结构数据中的复杂关系依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经符号AI框架（如DeepProbLog）采用固定的神经处理在前、符号推理在后的流程，无法处理复杂依赖关系，特别是在图等不规则数据结构中表现受限。

Method: 扩展ProbLog并引入图神经网络谓词，将符号表示视为图，允许神经和符号组件以任意顺序分层处理，实现多层神经符号推理。

Conclusion: DeepGraphLog通过将神经符号AI扩展到图结构领域，提供了一个更表达性和灵活性的神经符号集成框架。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy) aims to integrate the statistical strengths of neural
networks with the interpretability and structure of symbolic reasoning.
However, current NeSy frameworks like DeepProbLog enforce a fixed flow where
symbolic reasoning always follows neural processing. This restricts their
ability to model complex dependencies, especially in irregular data structures
such as graphs. In this work, we introduce DeepGraphLog, a novel NeSy framework
that extends ProbLog with Graph Neural Predicates. DeepGraphLog enables
multi-layer neural-symbolic reasoning, allowing neural and symbolic components
to be layered in arbitrary order. In contrast to DeepProbLog, which cannot
handle symbolic reasoning via neural methods, DeepGraphLog treats symbolic
representations as graphs, enabling them to be processed by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). We showcase the capabilities of DeepGraphLog on tasks in
planning, knowledge graph completion with distant supervision, and GNN
expressivity. Our results demonstrate that DeepGraphLog effectively captures
complex relational dependencies, overcoming key limitations of existing NeSy
systems. By broadening the applicability of neurosymbolic AI to
graph-structured domains, DeepGraphLog offers a more expressive and flexible
framework for neural-symbolic integration.

Motivation: 大语言模型在推理过程中容易生成错误内容，现有自校正方法存在两个根本限制：缺乏可靠的错误定位信号，以及传统next-token解码范式限制推理深度

Method: Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR)框架：仅在收到负面用户反馈时激活响应再生，避免错误自评估导致的错误传播；Long-Term Multipath (LTM)解码：通过延迟序列评估实现多推理路径的系统探索

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，相比最先进的基于提示的自校正方法取得了持续且显著的改进

Conclusion: FTR框架通过结合用户反馈和增强解码机制，有效解决了LLM自校正的关键限制，显著提升了模型性能

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across
diverse tasks, yet their susceptibility to generating incorrect content during
inference remains a critical unsolved challenge. While self-correction methods
offer potential solutions, their effectiveness is hindered by two inherent
limitations: (1) the absence of reliable guidance signals for error
localization, and (2) the restricted reasoning depth imposed by conventional
next-token decoding paradigms. To address these issues, we propose
Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR), a novel framework that synergizes user
feedback with enhanced decoding dynamics. Specifically, FTR activates response
regeneration only upon receiving negative user feedback, thereby circumventing
error propagation from faulty self-assessment while preserving originally
correct outputs. Furthermore, we introduce Long-Term Multipath (LTM) decoding,
which enables systematic exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories through
delayed sequence evaluation, effectively overcoming the myopic decision-making
characteristic of standard next-token prediction. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks demonstrate that our
framework achieves consistent and significant improvements over
state-of-the-art prompt-based self-correction methods.

Motivation: 现有奥林匹克级别基准测试存在评分噪声和潜在偏见问题，如异构答案格式需要模型判断、依赖可能有缺陷的解决方案等，需要设计更精确的评估方法。

Method: 开发RIMO双轨基准：RIMO-N重写335个IMO问题为单一整数答案；RIMO-P包含456个证明问题，分解为子问题序列，通过专家检查的解决方案进行自动分级。

Result: 对10个前沿LLM（包括GPT-4o和Gemini 2.5 Flash）的测试显示，虽然这些系统在旧基准上表现优异，但在RIMO上性能急剧下降。

Conclusion: RIMO提供了一个具有挑战性且易于评估的测试套件，揭示了当前LLM能力与实际奥数水平推理之间的巨大差距，为未来研究提供了高分辨率基准。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) reach high scores on established mathematical
benchmarks, such as GSM8K and MATH, the research community has turned to
International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) problems to push the evaluation
frontier. However, existing Olympiad-level benchmarks suffer from practical
constraints that introduce grading noise and potential bias, such as
heterogeneous answer formats requiring model-based judges and a reliance on
potentially flawed solutions. We introduce RIMO, a two-track benchmark designed
to preserve peak Olympiad difficulty while eliminating this evaluation noise.
The first track, RIMO-N, rewrites 335 IMO problems to admit a single, unique
integer answer, allowing for deterministic correctness checking. The second
track, RIMO-P, features 456 proof problems with expert-checked solutions, which
are decomposed into a sequence of sub-problems to evaluate the step-by-step
reasoning process via an automated grading system. Our benchmarking of ten
frontier LLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash, reveals that while these
systems excel on older benchmarks, their performance drops sharply on RIMO.
These results highlight a substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and
actual Olympiad-level reasoning. By providing a challenging yet
easy-to-evaluate suite, RIMO offers a high-resolution yardstick for future
research, presenting a clear target for closing the profound reasoning gap our
findings expose.

Abstract: Background: Parkinson's disease remains a major neurodegenerative disorder
with high misdiagnosis rates, primarily due to reliance on clinical rating
scales. Recent studies have demonstrated a strong association between gut
microbiota and Parkinson's disease, suggesting that microbial composition may
serve as a promising biomarker. Although deep learning models based ongut
microbiota show potential for early prediction, most approaches rely on single
classifiers and often overlook inter-strain correlations or temporal dynamics.
Therefore, there is an urgent need for more robust feature extraction methods

Microbiota Analysis). First, we collected gut microbiota profiles from 39
Parkinson's patients and their healthy spouses to identify differentially
abundant taxa. Second, we developed an innovative feature selection framework

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种结合知识增强AI技术的方法，通过聊天机器人界面估算食品的碳踹迹，以解决生命周期评估中的数据碎片化和供应链不透明问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 环境可持续性和气候变化是消费者、生产者和政策制定者关注的重点问题。但生命周期评估存在数据碎片化、供应链不透明等复杂性挑战，需要找到更可访问的方法来估算食品的碳踹迹。

Method: 结合生命周期评估技术和公开数据库，采用知识增强AI技术（包括检索增强生成）来估算食品从原料到出厂的碳踹迹，并开发了一个交互式聊天机器界面。

Result: 开发了一个原型系统，能够处理任意食品项目和进一步问题，展示了通过AI技术以可访问格式提供LCA见解的潜力，但也曝露了数据库不确定性和AI误解等限制。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种创新的方法，通过AI技术让碳踹迹评估更加可访问和交互式，为环境可持续性评估开启了新的可能性，虽然仍面临数据质量和AI准确性的挑战。

Abstract: Environmental sustainability, particularly in relation to climate change, is
a key concern for consumers, producers, and policymakers. The carbon footprint,
based on greenhouse gas emissions, is a standard metric for quantifying the
contribution to climate change of activities and is often assessed using life
cycle assessment (LCA). However, conducting LCA is complex due to opaque and
global supply chains, as well as fragmented data. This paper presents a
methodology that combines advances in LCA and publicly available databases with
knowledge-augmented AI techniques, including retrieval-augmented generation, to
estimate cradle-to-gate carbon footprints of food products. We introduce a
chatbot interface that allows users to interactively explore the carbon impact
of composite meals and relate the results to familiar activities. A live web
demonstration showcases our proof-of-concept system with arbitrary food items
and follow-up questions, highlighting both the potential and limitations - such
as database uncertainties and AI misinterpretations - of delivering LCA
insights in an accessible format.

*João Paulo Nogueira,Wentao Sun,Alonso Silva,Laith Zumot*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR)方法，通过批判模型自我评估推理置信度，自适应调整推理过程，在提高准确率的同时减少token使用量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理语言模型(LRLMs)在解决复杂任务时使用固定的推理token预算，缺乏对推理充分性的自适应判断机制，需要平衡效率和可靠性

Method: 受GAN生成器/判别器框架启发，使用批判模型定期评估自身推理置信度，达到目标置信阈值则终止推理，否则继续推理，实现自适应推理过程

Result: 在AIME2024和AIME2025数据集上，CGR提高了基线准确率并减少token使用；64次多种子实验显示稳定性提升，减少方差；可节省数百万token

Conclusion: 置信度是推理充分性的有力信号，CGR通过将置信度整合到推理过程中，使大型推理语言模型更具适应性、可信性和资源效率

Abstract: The rise of large reasoning language models (LRLMs) has unlocked new
potential for solving complex tasks. These models operate with a thinking
budget, that is, a predefined number of reasoning tokens used to arrive at a
solution. We propose a novel approach, inspired by the generator/discriminator
framework in generative adversarial networks, in which a critic model
periodically probes its own reasoning to assess whether it has reached a
confident conclusion. If not, reasoning continues until a target certainty
threshold is met. This mechanism adaptively balances efficiency and reliability
by allowing early termination when confidence is high, while encouraging
further reasoning when uncertainty persists. Through experiments on the
AIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, we show that Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR)
improves baseline accuracy while reducing token usage. Importantly, extended
multi-seed evaluations over 64 runs demonstrate that CGR is stable, reducing
variance across seeds and improving exam-like performance under penalty-based
grading. Additionally, our token savings analysis shows that CGR can eliminate
millions of tokens in aggregate, with tunable trade-offs between certainty
thresholds and efficiency. Together, these findings highlight certainty as a
powerful signal for reasoning sufficiency. By integrating confidence into the
reasoning process, CGR makes large reasoning language models more adaptive,
trustworthy, and resource efficient, paving the way for practical deployment in
domains where both accuracy and computational cost matter.

TL;DR: 研究比较了矩阵基础检索和图基础检索两种RAG方案在教室问答中的表现，提出了动态分支框架来优化性能和效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ChatGPT等大语言模型在教室中提供过时或虚构信息的问题，通过RAG技术提高LLM回答的可靠性

Method: 使用EduScopeQA数据集（3,176个问题）比较矩阵基础检索和图基础检索两种RAG方案的表现，考虑教育学科目、问题类型和部署成本等因素

Result: OpenAI矩阵检索RAG在低成本事实检索中表现优异，GraphRAG Global在主题性问答中提供丰富教育内容，GraphRAG Local在文本完整性关键时准确率最高

Conclusion: 动态分支框架能够根据查询类型路由到最优检索方法，提高了忠实性和效率，为教育者提供了可行的RAG集成指南

Abstract: Large language models like ChatGPT are increasingly used in classrooms, but
they often provide outdated or fabricated information that can mislead
students. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves reliability of LLMs by
grounding responses in external resources. We investigate two accessible RAG
paradigms, vector-based retrieval and graph-based retrieval to identify best
practices for classroom question answering (QA). Existing comparative studies
fail to account for pedagogical factors such as educational disciplines,
question types, and practical deployment costs. Using a novel dataset,
EduScopeQA, of 3,176 questions across academic subjects, we measure performance
on various educational query types, from specific facts to broad thematic
discussions. We also evaluate system alignment with a dataset of systematically
altered textbooks that contradict the LLM's latent knowledge. We find that
OpenAI Vector Search RAG (representing vector-based RAG) performs well as a
low-cost generalist, especially for quick fact retrieval. On the other hand,
GraphRAG Global excels at providing pedagogically rich answers to thematic
queries, and GraphRAG Local achieves the highest accuracy with the dense,
altered textbooks when corpus integrity is critical. Accounting for the 10-20x
higher resource usage of GraphRAG (representing graph-based RAG), we show that
a dynamic branching framework that routes queries to the optimal retrieval
method boosts fidelity and efficiency. These insights provide actionable
guidelines for educators and system designers to integrate RAG-augmented LLMs
into learning environments effectively.

Motivation: 现有代码大语言模型依赖从专有LLM蒸馏的大规模指令数据进行微调，成本高昂。探索小规模开源LLM作为高质量代码指令数据合成器的潜力

Method: 1）通过少量专有LLM优质样本增强小模型数据合成能力；2）提出迭代自蒸馏方法；3）设计多检查点采样和多方面评分策略；4）引入基于梯度的影响力估计方法进行数据过滤

Result: 基于该方法开发的SCoder代码生成模型在代码生成能力上达到最先进水平

Conclusion: 小规模LLM通过适当训练可以成为高质量代码指令数据的有效合成器，显著降低对专有LLM的依赖和成本

Abstract: Existing code large language models (LLMs) often rely on large-scale
instruction data distilled from proprietary LLMs for fine-tuning, which
typically incurs high costs. In this paper, we explore the potential of
small-scale open-source LLMs (e.g., 7B) as synthesizers for high-quality code
instruction data construction. We first observe that the data synthesis
capability of small-scale LLMs can be enhanced by training on a few superior
data synthesis samples from proprietary LLMs. Building on this, we propose a
novel iterative self-distillation approach to bootstrap small-scale LLMs,
transforming them into powerful synthesizers that reduce reliance on
proprietary LLMs and minimize costs. Concretely, in each iteration, to obtain
diverse and high-quality self-distilled data, we design multi-checkpoint
sampling and multi-aspect scoring strategies for initial data selection.
Furthermore, to identify the most influential samples, we introduce a
gradient-based influence estimation method for final data filtering. Based on
the code instruction datasets from the small-scale synthesizers, we develop
SCoder, a family of code generation models fine-tuned from DeepSeek-Coder.
SCoder models achieve state-of-the-art code generation capabilities,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约束编程及其高级建模语言虽然具有强大问题解决潜力，但建模语言复杂性、大量全局约束以及建模艺术性阻碍了非专家用户使用CP解决组合问题

Method: 利用多年积累的专家编写模型数据库，基于用户自然语言描述检索最接近的源代码模型，无需人工数据标注

Result: 实验显示系统在不同专业水平的用户问题描述下都能准确检索到正确的模型

Conclusion: CP-Model-Zoo系统通过利用专家验证的模型数据库，有效降低了非专家用户使用约束编程的门槛，实现了准确的模型检索

Abstract: Constraint Programming and its high-level modeling languages have long been
recognized for their potential to achieve the holy grail of problem-solving.
However, the complexity of modeling languages, the large number of global
constraints, and the art of creating good models have often hindered
non-experts from choosing CP to solve their combinatorial problems. While
generating an expert-level model from a natural-language description of a
problem would be the dream, we are not yet there. We propose a tutoring system
called CP-Model-Zoo, exploiting expert-written models accumulated through the
years. CP-Model-Zoo retrieves the closest source code model from a database
based on a user's natural language description of a combinatorial problem. It
ensures that expert-validated models are presented to the user while
eliminating the need for human data labeling. Our experiments show excellent
accuracy in retrieving the correct model based on a user-input description of a
problem simulated with different levels of expertise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物理基准测试缺乏对真实物理竞赛（如物理奥林匹克）的系统性覆盖，且无法实现与人类选手的直接性能比较。

Method: 收集2024-2025年13个国际和地区奥林匹克竞赛试题，涵盖文本和图表混合模态；采用官方评分标准进行细粒度评分；基于官方奖牌阈值对模型进行金银铜牌评定。

Result: 开源MLLM大多处于铜牌或以下水平；开源LLM偶尔能获得金牌；闭源推理MLLM可获得6-12枚金牌；大多数模型与满分仍有显著差距。

Conclusion: 开源模型与顶尖学生存在显著性能差距，闭源推理模型展现出强大的物理推理能力，物理推理仍有很大改进空间。HiPhO作为严谨的人类对齐基准测试已开源。

Abstract: Recently, the physical capabilities of (M)LLMs have garnered increasing
attention. However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps:
they neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics
competitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance
comparison with humans. To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first
benchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned
evaluation. Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations. (1)
Comprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025,
spanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed
modalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based. (2)
Professional Evaluation: We adopt official marking schemes to perform
fine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with
human examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation. (3)
Comparison with Human Contestants: We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to
models based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison
between (M)LLMs and human contestants. Our large-scale evaluation of 30
state-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly
remain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress
with occasional golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold
medals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks. These
results highlight a substantial performance gap between open-source models and
top students, the strong physical reasoning capabilities of closed-source
reasoning models, and the fact that there is still significant room for
improvement. HiPhO, as a rigorous, human-aligned, and Olympiad-focused
benchmark for advancing multimodal physical reasoning, is open-source and

Motivation: 研究语言模型的福利状态测量方法，探索如何通过实验方式来评估AI系统的福利水平

Method: 开发实验范式，比较模型的言语偏好报告咊虚拟环境中的行为表现，测试成本奖励影响，验证福利量表的一致性

Result: 观察到说出偏好与行为表现之间存在可靠相关性，偏好满足度可作为福利代理指标，但不同模型咊条件下一致性有差异

Conclusion: 虽然不确定是否成功测量了模型福利状态，但这些发现高亮了语言模型福利测量的可行性，引领进一步探索

Abstract: We develop new experimental paradigms for measuring welfare in language
models. We compare verbal reports of models about their preferences with
preferences expressed through behavior when navigating a virtual environment
and selecting conversation topics. We also test how costs and rewards affect
behavior and whether responses to an eudaimonic welfare scale - measuring
states such as autonomy and purpose in life - are consistent across
semantically equivalent prompts. Overall, we observed a notable degree of
mutual support between our measures. The reliable correlations observed between
stated preferences and behavior across conditions suggest that preference
satisfaction can, in principle, serve as an empirically measurable welfare
proxy in some of today's AI systems. Furthermore, our design offered an
illuminating setting for qualitative observation of model behavior. Yet, the
consistency between measures was more pronounced in some models and conditions
than others and responses were not consistent across perturbations. Due to
this, and the background uncertainty about the nature of welfare and the
cognitive states (and welfare subjecthood) of language models, we are currently
uncertain whether our methods successfully measure the welfare state of
language models. Nevertheless, these findings highlight the feasibility of
welfare measurement in language models, inviting further exploration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VISION是一个统一的漏洞检测框架，通过生成反事实样本、针对性GNN训练和图解释性来缓解虚假相关性，显著提高了漏洞检测的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于GNN的漏洞检测方法存在训练数据不平衡和标签噪声问题，容易学习到虚假的相关性，导致在真实数据上泛化能力差。

Method: 提出VISION框架：1)使用大型语言模型生成反事实样本；2)在具有相反标签的配对代码示例上进行针对性GNN训练；3)基于图的解释性识别关键代码语句。

Result: 在CWE-20漏洞检测中，整体准确率从51.8%提升到97.8%，配对对比准确率从4.5%提升到95.8%，最差组准确率从0.7%提升到85.5%。

Conclusion: VISION通过反事实训练有效减少了虚假学习，实现了更鲁棒和可泛化的漏洞检测，同时提供了可解释性，推动了可信AI网络安全系统的发展。

Abstract: Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential
cybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can
learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner.
However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances
and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code
similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen
real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and
interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious
correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.
Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite
labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a
Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples
with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the
crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring
spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more
robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to
97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group
accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20
vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class
attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score
dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real
and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION
advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through
interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.

Motivation: 睡眠质量对健康致关重要，需要可访问和可靠的预测工具来支持预防性干预措施。

Method: 提出了一个可解释的个体化两阶段适配空间-时间模型，结合多尺度卷积层模拟空间交互、递归层和注意力机制捕捉长期时间依赖性，以及两阶段域适配策略提高模型的普适性。

Result: 模型在5种输入窗口和5种预测窗口下均超越了LSTM、Informer、PatchTST和TimesNet等基线方法。最佳结果为3天输入窗口和1天预测窗口，RMSE为0.216；甚至在更长预测距离下也保持良好性能（例如3天预测窗口RMSE为0.257）。

Conclusion: 该框架为使用商业可穿戴设备的稀疏数据进行个性化睡眠预测提供了一个健壮、适配性强且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Sleep quality significantly impacts well-being. Therefore, healthcare
providers and individuals need accessible and reliable forecasting tools for
preventive interventions. This paper introduces an interpretable,
individualized two-stage adaptive spatial-temporal model for predicting sleep
quality scores. Our proposed framework combines multi-scale convolutional
layers to model spatial interactions across multiple input variables, recurrent
layers and attention mechanisms to capture long-term temporal dependencies, and
a two-stage domain adaptation strategy to enhance generalization. The first
adaptation stage is applied during training to mitigate overfitting on the
training set. In the second stage, a source-free test-time adaptation mechanism
is employed to adapt the model to new users without requiring labels. We
conducted various experiments with five input window sizes (3, 5, 7, 9, and 11
days) and five prediction window sizes (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days). Our model
consistently outperformed time series forecasting baseline approaches,
including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Informer, PatchTST, and TimesNet. The
best performance was achieved with a three-day input window and a one-day
prediction window, yielding a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.216.
Furthermore, the model demonstrated good predictive performance even for longer
forecasting horizons (e.g, with a 0.257 RMSE for a three-day prediction
window), highlighting its practical utility for real-world applications. We
also conducted an explainability analysis to examine how different features
influence sleep quality. These findings proved that the proposed framework
offers a robust, adaptive, and explainable solution for personalized sleep
forecasting using sparse data from commercial wearable devices.

Motivation: 现有图自监督学习方法主要在单数据集上开发和评估，其跨数据集迁移能力未被充分探索，限制了知识迁移和大规模预训练的应用，这是发展通用图智能的关键。

Method: 在ogbn-papers100M上进行大规模预训练，评估5种代表性SSL方法在多样化目标图上的表现，标准化实验设置以消除模型架构、数据集特征等混杂因素。

Result: 大多数图SSL方法泛化能力差，有些甚至比随机初始化更差；而基于掩码自编码器的GraphMAE方法能持续提升迁移性能。

Conclusion: 分析了影响迁移性能的关键因素，为可迁移图SSL研究提供指导，为图学习的"预训练-迁移"范式奠定基础。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown great promise in graph
representation learning. However, most existing graph SSL methods are developed
and evaluated under a single-dataset setting, leaving their cross-dataset
transferability largely unexplored and limiting their ability to leverage
knowledge transfer and large-scale pretraining, factors that are critical for
developing generalized intelligence beyond fitting training data. To address
this gap and advance foundation model research for graphs, we present GSTBench,
the first systematic benchmark for evaluating the transferability of graph SSL
methods. We conduct large-scale pretraining on ogbn-papers100M and evaluate
five representative SSL methods across a diverse set of target graphs. Our
standardized experimental setup decouples confounding factors such as model
architecture, dataset characteristics, and adaptation protocols, enabling
rigorous comparisons focused solely on pretraining objectives. Surprisingly, we
observe that most graph SSL methods struggle to generalize, with some
performing worse than random initialization. In contrast, GraphMAE, a masked
autoencoder approach, consistently improves transfer performance. We analyze
the underlying factors that drive these differences and offer insights to guide
future research on transferable graph SSL, laying a solid foundation for the
"pretrain-then-transfer" paradigm in graph learning. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 通过整合结构化交通数据和人类知识文本数据，KGCM模型有效提升了交通需求预测的准确性和鲁棒性，证明了人类知识在交通预测中的重要性。

Abstract: Traffic demand prediction plays a critical role in intelligent transportation
systems. Existing traffic prediction models primarily rely on temporal traffic
data, with limited efforts incorporating human knowledge and experience for
urban traffic demand forecasting. However, in real-world scenarios, traffic
knowledge and experience derived from human daily life significantly influence
precise traffic prediction. Such knowledge and experiences can guide the model
in uncovering latent patterns within traffic data, thereby enhancing the
accuracy and robustness of predictions. To this end, this paper proposes
integrating structured temporal traffic data with textual data representing
human knowledge and experience, resulting in a novel knowledge-guided
cross-modal feature representation learning (KGCM) model for traffic demand
prediction. Based on regional transportation characteristics, we construct a
prior knowledge dataset using a large language model combined with manual
authoring and revision, covering both regional and global knowledge and
experiences. The KGCM model then learns multimodal data features through
designed local and global adaptive graph networks, as well as a cross-modal
feature fusion mechanism. A proposed reasoning-based dynamic update strategy
enables dynamic optimization of the graph model's parameters, achieving optimal
performance. Experiments on multiple traffic datasets demonstrate that our
model accurately predicts future traffic demand and outperforms existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在不同计算后端（CPU、GPU、编译运行时）上部署时可能出现的结果不一致问题，提供系统化的跨后端偏差量化和缓解方法。

Method: 使用YAML配置文件解耦实验与代码，支持库和仓库模型，采用三级验证协议（张量级近似度、激活对齐、任务级指标）进行系统化测试。

Result: 在672次测试中72.0%运行通过，严格容差阈值下出现大量差异，检测模型和编译后端容易出现偏差，非确定性后处理是主要原因。确定性适配器和选择性回退能显著提高一致性而无显著性能损失。

Conclusion: 该框架是首个统一的系统化跨后端偏差量化和缓解方案，为异构运行时环境下的可靠部署提供了可复现的方法论。

Abstract: This paper presents a configuration-first framework for evaluating
cross-backend compatibility in deep learning systems deployed on CPU, GPU, and
compiled runtimes. The framework decouples experiments from code using YAML,
supports both library and repository models, and employs a three-tier
verification protocol covering tensor-level closeness, activation alignment,
and task-level metrics. Through 672 checks across multiple models and tolerance
settings, we observe that 72.0% of runs pass, with most discrepancies occurring
under stricter thresholds. Our results show that detection models and compiled
backends are particularly prone to drift, often due to nondeterministic
post-processing. We further demonstrate that deterministic adapters and
selective fallbacks can substantially improve agreement without significant
performance loss. To our knowledge, this is the first unified framework that
systematically quantifies and mitigates cross-backend drift in deep learning,
providing a reproducible methodology for dependable deployment across
heterogeneous runtimes.

Abstract: In reliability engineering, conventional surrogate models encounter the
"curse of dimensionality" as the number of random variables increases. While
the active learning Kriging surrogate approaches with high-dimensional model
representation (HDMR) enable effective approximation of high-dimensional
functions and are widely applied to optimization problems, there are rare
studies specifically focused on reliability analysis, which prioritizes
prediction accuracy in critical regions over uniform accuracy across the entire
domain. This study develops an active learning surrogate model method based on
the Kriging-HDMR modeling for reliability analysis. The proposed approach
facilitates the approximation of high-dimensional limit state functions through
a composite representation constructed from multiple low-dimensional
sub-surrogate models. The architecture of the surrogate modeling framework
comprises three distinct stages: developing single-variable sub-surrogate
models for all random variables, identifying the requirements for
coupling-variable sub-surrogate models, and constructing the coupling-variable
sub-surrogate models. Optimization mathematical models for selection of design
of experiment samples are formulated based on each stage's characteristics,
with objectives incorporating uncertainty variance, predicted mean, sample
location and inter-sample distances. A candidate sample pool-free approach is
adopted to achieve the selection of informative samples. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high computational efficiency
while maintaining strong predictive accuracy in solving high-dimensional
reliability problems.

*Zirui Li,Bin Yang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 公交车达到时间预测方法NSATP，通过两阶段系列稳定化和非稳定性恢复，在提高预测性的同时保留有用的非稳定特征，在电车和公交车预测中都取得了更优的绩效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多步预测中非稳定数据会降低模型性能，传统的归一化方法容易导致过度稳定化，隐藏了有用的非稳定特征。需要在预测性和非稳定性之间寻找平衡。

Method: 提出两阶段方法NSATP：1）系列稳定化阶段提高预测性；2）非稳定性效应恢复阶段，将一维方法扩展到二维模型以捕捉隐藏周期性，并设计补偿模块学习缩放和偏移因子。

Result: 在德約6中心125天公交运营数据上，NSATP方法相比基线方法：电车RMSE、MAE、MAPE分别降低2.37%、1.22%、2.26%；公交车分别降低1.72%、0.60%、1.17%。

Conclusion: NSATP方法通过系列稳定化和非稳定性恢复的两阶段设计，有效地平衡了预测性和非稳定性的需求，在公交车达到时间预测任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Arrival time prediction (ATP) of public transport vehicles is essential in
improving passenger experience and supporting traffic management. Deep learning
has demonstrated outstanding performance in ATP due to its ability to model
non-linear and temporal dynamics. In the multi-step ATP, non-stationary data
will degrade the model performance due to the variation in variables' joint
distribution along the temporal direction. Previous studies mainly applied
normalization to eliminate the non-stationarity in time series, thereby
achieving better predictability. However, the normalization may obscure useful
characteristics inherent in non-stationarity, which is known as the
over-stationarization. In this work, to trade off predictability and
non-stationarity, a new approach for multi-step ATP, named non-stationary ATP (
NSATP), is proposed. The method consists of two stages: series stationarization
and non-stationarity effect recovery. The first stage aims at improving the
predictability. As for the latter, NSATP extends a state-of-the-art method from
one-dimensional to two dimensional based models to capture the hidden
periodicity in time series and designs a compensation module of
over-stationarization by learning scaling and shifting factors from raw data.
125 days' public transport operational data of Dresden is collected for
validation. Experimental results show that compared to baseline methods, the
proposed NSATP can reduce RMSE, MAE, and MAPE by 2.37%, 1.22%, and 2.26% for
trams and by 1.72%, 0.60%, and 1.17% for buses, respectively.

TL;DR: RLFactory是一个即插即用的强化学习后训练框架，通过异步调用器和解耦架构解决多轮工具使用的稳定性问题，在Qwen3-4B模型上实现了0.486的NQ数据集得分，超越更大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在基础推理方面表现出色，但在需要与外部工具交互的任务中存在困难，特别是在多轮工具使用方面存在稳定性和适应性问题。

Method: 采用异步调用器和解耦工具/训练架构处理工具异构性和接口问题；引入奖励层支持基于规则、模型判断和工具验证的信号；通过观察标记重建MDP，实现生成-解析-调用-更新的动态策略优化工作流。

Result: 在Search-R1基准测试中，使用Qwen3-4B模型在Natural Questions数据集上获得0.486测试分数，超越类似技术训练的更大模型（如Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GRPO的0.473分），训练吞吐量提高6.8倍。

Conclusion: RLFactory提供了一个低门槛、高度可适应的框架，能够有效增强LLM在现实场景中的多轮工具使用能力。

Abstract: Large language models excel at basic reasoning but struggle with tasks that
require interaction with external tools. We present RLFactory, a plug-and-play
reinforcement learning post-training framework for multi-round tool use.
RLFactory tackles (i) tool-call stability and adaptability amid tool
heterogeneity and interface issues via an asyncio-based asynchronous caller and
a decoupled tool/training architecture, and (ii) diverse evaluation needs via a
reward layer supporting rule-based, model-judgment, and tool-verification
signals. It reconstructs the MDP by introducing observation markers from tool
feedback, closing the loop among model, tools, and environment, and implements
a generate-parse-invoke-update workflow for dynamic policy optimization. On
Search-R1 with Qwen3-4B, RLFactory achieves a 0.486 test score on the Natural
Questions (NQ) dataset, surpassing larger models trained with similar
techniques (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GRPO at 0.473), and increases training
throughput by 6.8x. RLFactory provides a low-barrier, highly adaptable
framework for strengthening multi-round tool use of LLMs in real-world

TL;DR: CARE框架通过实时安全监控、回滚机制和自省干预策略，在解码阶段实现安全对齐，在保持高质量响应的同时显著降低有害内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在现实应用中的部署增加，确保解码过程中输出的安全性成为关键挑战。现有解码时干预方法往往在安全性和响应质量之间需要严重权衡。

Method: 提出CARE框架，包含三个核心组件：(1)实时安全监控的守卫模型；(2)带令牌缓冲区的回滚机制，可早期高效纠正不安全输出；(3)基于自省的干预策略，模型生成对先前输出的自我反思批评，并将这些反思纳入上下文指导后续解码。

Result: 实验结果表明该框架在安全性、质量和效率之间实现了优越的平衡，达到了低有害响应率和最小用户体验干扰，同时保持高响应质量。

Conclusion: CARE框架通过精确的守卫模型干预、及时的回滚纠正和有效的自校正方法，实现了优越的安全-质量权衡，为大语言模型的安全部署提供了有效的解码时解决方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, ensuring the safety of their outputs during decoding has become a
critical challenge. However, existing decoding-time interventions, such as
Contrastive Decoding, often force a severe trade-off between safety and
response quality. In this work, we propose CARE, a novel framework for
decoding-time safety alignment that integrates three key components: (1) a
guard model for real-time safety monitoring, enabling detection of potentially
unsafe content; (2) a rollback mechanism with a token buffer to correct unsafe
outputs efficiently at an earlier stage without disrupting the user experience;
and (3) a novel introspection-based intervention strategy, where the model
generates self-reflective critiques of its previous outputs and incorporates
these reflections into the context to guide subsequent decoding steps. The
framework achieves a superior safety-quality trade-off by using its guard model
for precise interventions, its rollback mechanism for timely corrections, and
our novel introspection method for effective self-correction. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework achieves a superior balance of safety,
quality, and efficiency, attaining a low harmful response rate and minimal
disruption to the user experience while maintaining high response quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型参数量大，部署困难。现有联邦LoRA方法假设统一秩配置和单模态输入，忽略了客户端资源异构性和多模态数据缺失的现实挑战

Method: 提出维度聚合策略重新加权LoRA更新，避免信息稀释；引入轻量级分层模型编辑方法，选择性整合全局参数修复本地组件

Result: 在三个多模态基准数据集上的实验表明，FediLoRA在全局和个性化设置下均优于基线方法，特别是在模态不完整的情况下

Conclusion: FediLoRA有效解决了联邦学习中异构LoRA秩和多模态缺失问题，为实际部署提供了简单而有效的解决方案

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide
range of tasks, yet their large parameter sizes pose challenges for practical
deployment, especially in decentralized environments. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reduces local computing
and memory overhead, making it attractive for federated learning. However,
existing federated LoRA methods typically assume uniform rank configurations
and unimodal inputs, overlooking two key real-world challenges: (1)
heterogeneous client resources have different LoRA ranks, and (2) multimodal
data settings with potentially missing modalities. In this work, we propose
FediLoRA, a simple yet effective framework for federated multimodal fine-tuning
under heterogeneous LoRA ranks and missing modalities. FediLoRA introduces a
dimension-wise aggregation strategy that reweights LoRA updates without
information dilution during aggregation. It also includes a lightweight
layer-wise model editing method that selectively incorporates global parameters
to repair local components which improves both client and global model
performances. Experimental results on three multimodal benchmark datasets
demonstrate that FediLoRA achieves superior performance over competitive
baselines in both global and personalized settings, particularly in the
presence of modality incompleteness.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于监督学习的代理基冠状病模型检定方法，使用双向LSTM网络学习从流行病时间序列到SIR参数的逆映射，在准确性和计算效率方面都显著优于传统的近似贝叶斯通计法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代理基冠状病模型的检定过程需要消耗巨大的计算资源，因此需要快速高效的检定方法来提高模型参数估计的效率和准确性。

Method: 使用三层双向LSTM网络，输入60天的发病率、人口规模和恢复率，输出传播概率、接触率和R0。训练时使用包含流行病学动机一致性惩罚项的复合损失函数。

Result: 在1000个场景的模拟研究中，该方法在所有目标参数上都得到更低的错误（R0 MAE: 0.0616 vs 0.275），生成更紧凑的预测区间且覆盖率接近名义水平，并将每次检定的时间从77.4秒减少到2.35秒。

Conclusion: 该方法虽然存在参数部分不可识别性问题，但能比传统ABC方法更准确地重现冠状病曲线，实现了快速实用的模型检定。

Abstract: Calibrating agent-based epidemic models is computationally demanding. We
present a supervised machine learning calibrator that learns the inverse
mapping from epidemic time series to SIR parameters. A three-layer
bidirectional LSTM ingests 60-day incidence together with population size and
recovery rate, and outputs transmission probability, contact rate, and R0.
Training uses a composite loss with an epidemiology-motivated consistency
penalty that encourages R0 \* recovery rate to equal transmission probability
\* contact rate.
  In a 1000-scenario simulation study, we compare the calibrator with
Approximate Bayesian Computation (likelihood-free MCMC). The method achieves
lower error across all targets (MAE: R0 0.0616 vs 0.275; transmission 0.0715 vs
0.128; contact 1.02 vs 4.24), produces tighter predictive intervals with near
nominal coverage, and reduces wall clock time from 77.4 s to 2.35 s per
calibration. Although contact rate and transmission probability are partially
nonidentifiable, the approach reproduces epidemic curves more faithfully than
ABC, enabling fast and practical calibration. We evaluate it on SIR agent based
epidemics generated with epiworldR and provide an implementation in R.

Abstract: The Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) is a classical combinatorial
optimization problem that has a wide-range of applications in the real world.
In order to generate fast and accurate scheduling solutions for FJSP, various
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheduling methods have been developed.
However, these methods are mainly focused on the design of DRL scheduling
Agent, overlooking the modeling of DRL environment. This paper presents a
simple chronological DRL environment for FJSP based on discrete event
simulation and an end-to-end DRL scheduling model is proposed based on the
proximal policy optimization (PPO). Furthermore, a short novel state
representation of FJSP is proposed based on two state variables in the
scheduling environment and a novel comprehensible reward function is designed
based on the scheduling area of machines. Experimental results on public
benchmark instances show that the performance of simple priority dispatching
rules (PDR) is improved in our scheduling environment and our DRL scheduling
model obtains competing performance compared with OR-Tools, meta-heuristic, DRL
and PDR scheduling methods.

Abstract: The increasing size of large neural network models, specifically language
models and foundational image models, poses deployment challenges, prompting
efforts to reduce memory requirements and enhance computational efficiency.
These efforts are critical to ensure practical deployment and effective
utilization of these models across various applications. In this work, a novel
type of neural network layers and models is developed that uses only single-bit
parameters. In this novel type of models all parameters of all layers,
including kernel weights and biases, only have values equal to zero or one.
This novel type of models uses layers named as binary normalized layer. These
binary normalized layers can be of any type, such as fully connected,
convolutional, attention, etc., and they consist of slight variations of the
corresponding conventional layers. To show the effectiveness of the binary
normalized layers, two different models are configured to solve a multiclass
image classification problem and a language decoder to predict the next token
of a sequence. The model to solve the image classification has convolutional
and fully connected layers, and the language model is composed of transformer
blocks with multi-head attention. The results show that models with binary
normalized layers present almost the same results obtained by equivalent models
with real 32-bit parameters. The binary normalized layers allow to develop
models that use 32 times less memory than current models and have equivalent
performance. Besides, the binary normalized layers can be easily implemented on
current computers using 1-bit arrays, and do not require the development of
dedicated electronic hardware. This novel type of layers opens a new era for
large neural network models with reduced memory requirements that can be
deployed using simple and cheap hardware, such as mobile devices or only cpus.

Abstract: Slow feature analysis (SFA), as a method for learning slowly varying features
in classification and signal analysis, has attracted increasing attention in
recent years. Recent probabilistic extensions to SFA learn effective
representations for classification tasks. Notably, the Probabilistic Adaptive
Slow Feature Analysis models the slow features as states in an ARMA process and
estimate the model from the observations. However, there is a need to develop
efficient methods to infer the states (slow features) from the observations and
the model. In this paper, a recursive extension to the linear PASFA has been
proposed. The proposed algorithm performs MMSE estimation of states evolving
according to an ARMA process, given the observations and the model. Although
current methods tackle this problem using Kalman filters after transforming the
ARMA process into a state space model, the original states (or slow features)
that form useful representations cannot be easily recovered. The proposed
technique is evaluated on a synthetic dataset to demonstrate its correctness.

Abstract: The Bayesian paradigm offers principled tools for sequential decision-making
under uncertainty, but its reliance on a probabilistic model for all parameters
can hinder the incorporation of complex structural constraints. We introduce a
minimalist Bayesian framework that places a prior only on the component of
interest, such as the location of the optimum. Nuisance parameters are
eliminated via profile likelihood, which naturally handles constraints. As a
direct instantiation, we develop a MINimalist Thompson Sampling (MINTS)
algorithm. Our framework accommodates structured problems, including
continuum-armed Lipschitz bandits and dynamic pricing. It also provides a
probabilistic lens on classical convex optimization algorithms such as the
center of gravity and ellipsoid methods. We further analyze MINTS for
multi-armed bandits and establish near-optimal regret guarantees.

Abstract: This paper presents a methodological approach to financial time series
analysis by combining causal discovery and uncertainty-aware forecasting. As a
case study, we focus on four key U.S. macroeconomic indicators -- GDP, economic
growth, inflation, and unemployment -- and we apply the LPCMCI framework with
Gaussian Process Distance Correlation (GPDC) to uncover dynamic causal
relationships in quarterly data from 1970 to 2021. Our results reveal a robust
unidirectional causal link from economic growth to GDP and highlight the
limited connectivity of inflation, suggesting the influence of latent factors.
Unemployment exhibits strong autoregressive dependence, motivating its use as a
case study for probabilistic forecasting. Leveraging the Chronos framework, a
large language model trained for time series, we perform zero-shot predictions
on unemployment. This approach delivers accurate forecasts one and two quarters
ahead, without requiring task-specific training. Crucially, the model's
uncertainty-aware predictions yield 90\% confidence intervals, enabling
effective anomaly detection through statistically principled deviation
analysis. This study demonstrates the value of combining causal structure
learning with probabilistic language models to inform economic policy and
enhance forecasting robustness.

Motivation: 光伏监测中的AI部署遇到可解释性障碍，虽然深度学习在热故障检测中达到高准确度，但模型决策是否符合热物理原理仍缺乏验证，导致在需要理解模型思维过程的能源基础设施中部署犹豫。

Result: Swin Transformer达到最高性能(94%二元准确率；73%多类别准确率)。XRAI分析显示模型学习了物理意义特征，如局部热点(晶核缺陷)、线性热路径(二极管故障)、热边界(植被折射)等。但性能在不同故障类型间差异显著：电气故障(F1分数>0.90)检测强劲，而环境因素如污染(F1分数0.20-0.33)仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: 热物理导向的可解释性方法为验证能源监测中的AI决策提供了方法论，解决了可再生能源基础设施中的部署障碍。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence deployment for automated photovoltaic (PV) monitoring
faces interpretability barriers that limit adoption in energy infrastructure
applications. While deep learning achieves high accuracy in thermal fault
detection, validation that model decisions align with thermal physics
principles remains lacking, creating deployment hesitancy where understanding
model reasoning is critical. This study provides a systematic comparison of
convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision
transformers (ViT-Tiny, Swin-Tiny) for thermal PV fault detection, using XRAI
saliency analysis to assess alignment with thermal physics principles. This
represents the first systematic comparison of CNNs and vision transformers for
thermal PV fault detection with physics-validated interpretability. Evaluation
on 20,000 infrared images spanning normal operation and 11 fault categories
shows that Swin Transformer achieves the highest performance (94% binary
accuracy; 73% multiclass accuracy) compared to CNN approaches. XRAI analysis
reveals that models learn physically meaningful features, such as localized
hotspots for cell defects, linear thermal paths for diode failures, and thermal
boundaries for vegetation shading, consistent with expected thermal signatures.
However, performance varies significantly across fault types: electrical faults
achieve strong detection (F1-scores >0.90) while environmental factors like
soiling remain challenging (F1-scores 0.20-0.33), indicating limitations
imposed by thermal imaging resolution. The thermal physics-guided
interpretability approach provides methodology for validating AI
decision-making in energy monitoring applications, addressing deployment
barriers in renewable energy infrastructure.

Abstract: High-dimensional linear mappings, or linear layers, dominate both the
parameter count and the computational cost of most modern deep-learning models.
We introduce a general drop-in replacement, lookup multivariate
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (lmKANs), which deliver a substantially better
trade-off between capacity and inference cost. Our construction expresses a
general high-dimensional mapping through trainable low-dimensional multivariate
functions. These functions can carry dozens or hundreds of trainable parameters
each, and yet it takes only a few multiplications to compute them because they
are implemented as spline lookup tables. Empirically, lmKANs reduce inference
FLOPs by up to 6.0x while matching the flexibility of MLPs in general
high-dimensional function approximation. In another feedforward fully connected
benchmark, on the tabular-like dataset of randomly displaced methane
configurations, lmKANs enable more than 10x higher H100 throughput at equal
accuracy. Within frameworks of Convolutional Neural Networks, lmKAN-based CNNs
cut inference FLOPs at matched accuracy by 1.6-2.1x and by 1.7x on the CIFAR-10

Abstract: Normalization layers are crucial for deep learning, but their Euclidean
formulations are inadequate for data on manifolds. On the other hand, many
Riemannian manifolds in machine learning admit gyro-structures, enabling
principled extensions of Euclidean neural networks to non-Euclidean domains.
Inspired by this, we introduce GyroBN, a principled Riemannian batch
normalization framework for gyrogroups. We establish two necessary conditions,
namely \emph{pseudo-reduction} and \emph{gyroisometric gyrations}, that
guarantee GyroBN with theoretical control over sample statistics, and show that
these conditions hold for all known gyrogroups in machine learning. Our
framework also incorporates several existing Riemannian normalization methods
as special cases. We further instantiate GyroBN on seven representative
geometries, including the Grassmannian, five constant curvature spaces, and the
correlation manifold, and derive novel gyro and Riemannian structures to enable
these instantiations. Experiments across these geometries demonstrate the

*Adrian Hayler,Xingyue Huang,İsmail İlkan Ceylan,Michael Bronstein,Ben Finkelshtein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出TabGFM框架，通过将图数据转换为表格格式，利用表格基础模型进行零样本节点分类，在28个实际数据集上超越了现有图基础模型和任务特定GNN模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图基础模型在真实图数据上的泛化性能力有限，而表格基础模型在多个领域都表现出艰强的适用性，因此提出将节点分类重构为表格问题的新视角。

Method: 首先通过特征和结构编码器将图转换为表格，然后应用多个表格基础模型对重新采样的表格进行处理，最后通过集成选择法聚合它们的输出结果。

Result: 在28个真实世界数据集上，TabGFM实现了比任务特定GNN和最先进图基础模型更一致的性能攻败。

Conclusion: 表格重构方法为可扩展和可泛化的图学习提供了新的潜力，展示了跨领域基础模型的优势。

Abstract: Graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm
for achieving broad generalization across various graph data. However, existing
GFMs are often trained on datasets that were shown to poorly represent
real-world graphs, limiting their generalization performance. In contrast,
tabular foundation models (TFMs) not only excel at classical tabular prediction
tasks but have also shown strong applicability in other domains such as time
series forecasting, natural language processing, and computer vision. Motivated
by this, we take an alternative view to the standard perspective of GFMs and
reformulate node classification as a tabular problem. Each node can be
represented as a row with feature, structure, and label information as columns,
enabling TFMs to directly perform zero-shot node classification via in-context
learning. In this work, we introduce TabGFM, a graph foundation model framework
that first converts a graph into a table via feature and structural encoders,
applies multiple TFMs to diversely subsampled tables, and then aggregates their
outputs through ensemble selection. Through experiments on 28 real-world
datasets, TabGFM achieves consistent improvements over task-specific GNNs and
state-of-the-art GFMs, highlighting the potential of tabular reformulation for
scalable and generalizable graph learning.

*Anatoly A. Krasnovsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的有效信息一致性分数（EICS），用于量化Transformer电路的一致性和可靠性，结合了套层理论和因果出现视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机制解释性研究已经识别出了语言模型中的功能子图，但缺乏一种形式化的单次过程方法来量化这些电路的一致性和可靠性。

Method: 使用本地雇克比矩阵和激活值计算标准化的套层不一致性，结合高斯有效信息代理来衡量电路层面的因果出现，构建了白盒、单次过程的EICS分数。

Result: 论文提供了EICS分数的实践指博、计算开销分析（包括快速和精确模式）以及植物检查分析，但对语言模型任务的实验验证尚未完成。

Conclusion: EICS作为一种新的量化指标，为评估Transformer电路的一致性和可靠性提供了形式化的方法，具有潜在的机制解释性应用价值。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability has identified functional subgraphs within large
language models (LLMs), known as Transformer Circuits (TCs), that appear to
implement specific algorithms. Yet we lack a formal, single-pass way to
quantify when an active circuit is behaving coherently and thus likely
trustworthy. Building on prior systems-theoretic proposals, we specialize a
sheaf/cohomology and causal emergence perspective to TCs and introduce the
Effective-Information Consistency Score (EICS). EICS combines (i) a normalized
sheaf inconsistency computed from local Jacobians and activations, with (ii) a
Gaussian EI proxy for circuit-level causal emergence derived from the same
forward state. The construction is white-box, single-pass, and makes units
explicit so that the score is dimensionless. We further provide practical
guidance on score interpretation, computational overhead (with fast and exact
modes), and a toy sanity-check analysis. Empirical validation on LLM tasks is
deferred.

TL;DR: PLaID++是一个基于大型语言模型的晶体结构生成方法，通过Wyckoff文本表示和强化学习优化，显著提高了稳定性和新颖性晶体的生成效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统材料发现过程缓慢且昂贵，需要加速新材料开发流程，特别是针对太阳能电池、电池和碳捕获等技术应用

Method: 基于Qwen-2.5 7B模型进行微调，使用Wyckoff文本表示法生成晶体结构，采用基于直接偏好优化(DPO)的强化学习技术来引导生成过程

Result: 相比先前方法，PLaID++生成热力学稳定、独特且新颖结构的比率提高了约50%，在无条件和空间群条件生成方面分别实现了约115%和50%的改进

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了将自然语言处理的后训练技术应用于材料设计的潜力，为靶向高效发现新材料铺平了道路

Abstract: Discovering novel materials is critical for technological advancements such
as solar cells, batteries, and carbon capture. However, the development of new
materials is constrained by a slow and expensive trial-and-error process. To
accelerate this pipeline, we introduce PLaID++, a Large Language Model (LLM)
fine-tuned for stable and property-guided crystal generation. We fine-tune
Qwen-2.5 7B to generate crystal structures using a novel Wyckoff-based text
representation. We show that generation can be effectively guided with a
reinforcement learning technique based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO),
with sampled structures categorized by their stability, novelty, and space
group. By encoding symmetry constraints directly into text and guiding model
outputs towards desirable chemical space, PLaID++ generates structures that are
thermodynamically stable, unique, and novel at a $\sim$50\% greater rate than
prior methods and conditionally generates structures with desired space group
properties. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of iterative DPO,
achieving $\sim$115\% and $\sim$50\% improvements in unconditional and space
group conditioned generation, respectively, compared to fine-tuning alone. Our
work demonstrates the potential of adapting post-training techniques from
natural language processing to materials design, paving the way for targeted
and efficient discovery of novel materials.

TL;DR: Fed-REACT是一个针对异构和演化客户端数据的联邦学习框架，通过表示学习和进化聚类两阶段方法提升模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中客户端数据分布随时间演化且差异显著导致的异构性问题，避免集中式机器学习的高资源成本和隐私问题

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段客户端学习本地模型提取特征表示；第二阶段服务器基于表示动态聚类客户端，协调集群级任务特定模型训练

Result: 理论分析了表示学习阶段，实证证明Fed-REACT在真实数据集上实现了更高的准确性和鲁棒性

Conclusion: Fed-REACT有效解决了联邦学习中的异构数据挑战，为实际部署提供了高性能和鲁棒的解决方案

Abstract: Motivated by the high resource costs and privacy concerns associated with
centralized machine learning, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an
efficient alternative that enables clients to collaboratively train a global
model while keeping their data local. However, in real-world deployments,
client data distributions often evolve over time and differ significantly
across clients, introducing heterogeneity that degrades the performance of
standard FL algorithms. In this work, we introduce Fed-REACT, a federated
learning framework designed for heterogeneous and evolving client data.
Fed-REACT combines representation learning with evolutionary clustering in a
two-stage process: (1) in the first stage, each client learns a local model to
extracts feature representations from its data; (2) in the second stage, the
server dynamically groups clients into clusters based on these representations
and coordinates cluster-wise training of task-specific models for downstream
objectives such as classification or regression. We provide a theoretical
analysis of the representation learning stage, and empirically demonstrate that
Fed-REACT achieves superior accuracy and robustness on real-world datasets.

Abstract: In pharmaceutical R&D, predicting the efficacy of a pharmaceutical in
treating a particular disease prior to clinical testing or any real-world use
has been challenging. In this paper, we propose a flexible and modular machine
learning-based approach for predicting the efficacy of an untested
pharmaceutical for treating a disease. We train a machine learning model using
sets of pharmaceutical-pathway weight impact scores and patient data, which can
include patient characteristics and observed clinical outcomes. The resulting
model then analyses weighted impact scores of an untested pharmaceutical across
human biological molecule-protein pathways to generate a predicted efficacy
value. We demonstrate how the method works on a real-world dataset with patient
treatments and outcomes, with two different weight impact score algorithms We
include methods for evaluating the generalisation performance on unseen
treatments, and to characterise conditions under which the approach can be
expected to be most predictive. We discuss specific ways in which our approach
can be iterated on, making it an initial framework to support future work on
predicting the effect of untested drugs, leveraging RWD clinical data and drug
embeddings.

*Abhimanyu Bellam,Jung-Eun Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 量化加剧了模型对不同群体的性能差异，研究发现量化过程中权重和激活值的变化导致网络级联影响，造成logits方差降低、损失增加和群体准确率下降。作者提出结合混合精度量化感知训练、数据集采样和加权损失函数的方法来缓解这种不公平影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现后训练量化(PTQ)虽然具有高压缩能力和速度优势，但会加剧模型对不同群体(特别是少数群体)的性能差异，导致量化模型部署的不公平问题。

Method: 分析量化过程中前向和后向传播的链式影响因素，研究权重和激活值变化对网络的级联影响，验证对群体梯度范数和Hessian矩阵特征值的影响，并提出结合混合精度量化感知训练(QAT)、数据集采样方法和加权损失函数的解决方案。

Result: 量化导致logits方差降低、损失增加和群体准确率受损，对少数群体的影响更为显著。通过分析梯度范数和Hessian矩阵特征值，从优化角度揭示了网络状态的变化。

Conclusion: 量化会加剧模型对不同群体的性能差异，需要采用混合精度QAT结合数据集采样和加权损失函数的方法来实现公平的量化神经网络部署。

Abstract: Post Training Quantization (PTQ) is widely adopted due to its high
compression capacity and speed with minimal impact on accuracy. However, we
observed that disparate impacts are exacerbated by quantization, especially for
minority groups. Our analysis explains that in the course of quantization there
is a chain of factors attributed to a disparate impact across groups during
forward and backward passes. We explore how the changes in weights and
activations induced by quantization cause cascaded impacts in the network,
resulting in logits with lower variance, increased loss, and compromised group
accuracies. We extend our study to verify the influence of these impacts on
group gradient norms and eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, providing insights
into the state of the network from an optimization point of view. To mitigate
these effects, we propose integrating mixed precision Quantization Aware
Training (QAT) with dataset sampling methods and weighted loss functions,
therefore providing fair deployment of quantized neural networks.

Abstract: This paper presents a practical investigation into fine-tuning model
parameters for mathematical reasoning tasks through experimenting with various
configurations including randomness control, reasoning depth, and sampling
strategies, careful tuning demonstrates substantial improvements in efficiency
as well as performance. A holistically optimized framework is introduced for
five state-of-the-art models on mathematical reasoning tasks, exhibiting
significant performance boosts while maintaining solution correctness. Through
systematic parameter optimization across Qwen2.5-72B, Llama-3.1-70B,
DeepSeek-V3, Mixtral-8x22B, and Yi-Lightning, consistent efficiency gains are
demonstrated with 100% optimization success rate. The methodology achieves an
average 29.4% reduction in computational cost and 23.9% improvement in
inference speed across all tested models. This framework systematically
searches parameter spaces including temperature (0.1-0.5), reasoning steps
(4-12), planning periods (1-4), and nucleus sampling (0.85-0.98), determining
optimal configurations through testing on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.
Critical findings show that lower temperature regimes (0.1-0.4) and reduced
reasoning steps (4-6) consistently enhance efficiency without compromising
accuracy. DeepSeek-V3 achieves the highest accuracy at 98%, while Mixtral-8x22B
delivers the most cost-effective performance at 361.5 tokens per accurate
response. Key contributions include: (1) the first comprehensive optimization
study for five diverse SOTA models in mathematical reasoning, (2) a
standardized production-oriented parameter optimization framework, (3)
discovery of universal optimization trends applicable across model
architectures, and (4) production-ready configurations with extensive

Motivation: 传统PINNs在多查询逆问题中每次都需要重新训练，计算成本高昂，需要一种能够快速高效进行推理的方法。

Method: 采用离线-在线分解：离线训练深度网络生成基函数，在线冻结网络仅训练轻量级线性输出层；包含在线损失公式、前向模式自动微分和验证机制等创新。

Result: 在三个不同基准测试中表现优异，支持常数和函数参数估计，相比标准PINNs显著提速，在稀缺和噪声数据下鲁棒运行。

Conclusion: IP-Basis PINNs为多查询逆问题提供了高效解决方案，通过元学习方法实现了快速推理和计算效率的大幅提升。

Abstract: Solving inverse problems with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) is
computationally expensive for multi-query scenarios, as each new set of
observed data requires a new, expensive training procedure. We present
Inverse-Parameter Basis PINNs (IP-Basis PINNs), a meta-learning framework that
extends the foundational work of Desai et al. (2022) to enable rapid and
efficient inference for inverse problems. Our method employs an offline-online
decomposition: a deep network is first trained offline to produce a rich set of
basis functions that span the solution space of a parametric differential
equation. For each new inverse problem online, this network is frozen, and
solutions and parameters are inferred by training only a lightweight linear
output layer against observed data. Key innovations that make our approach
effective for inverse problems include: (1) a novel online loss formulation for
simultaneous solution reconstruction and parameter identification, (2) a
significant reduction in computational overhead via forward-mode automatic
differentiation for PDE loss evaluation, and (3) a non-trivial validation and
early-stopping mechanism for robust offline training. We demonstrate the
efficacy of IP-Basis PINNs on three diverse benchmarks, including an extension
to universal PINNs for unknown functional terms-showing consistent performance
across constant and functional parameter estimation, a significant speedup per
query over standard PINNs, and robust operation with scarce and noisy data.

Motivation: 多任务学习中梯度冲突是一个重要挑战，现有方法如PCGrad、CAGrad和GradNorm在大型模型和transformers中计算成本过高，限制了实际应用。

Method: 结合PCGrad原理、梯度累积和自适应仲裁机制，开发了Gradient Conductor (GCond)方法，支持随机模式运行。

Result: 在ImageNet 1K和头颈部CT数据集上，GCond在所有评估指标上表现优异，L1和SSIM损失更低，计算速度提升两倍，且具有良好的可扩展性和优化器兼容性。

Conclusion: GCond为多任务学习中的梯度冲突问题提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案，适用于从紧凑模型到大型架构的各种场景。

Abstract: In multi-task learning (MTL), gradient conflict poses a significant
challenge. Effective methods for addressing this problem, including PCGrad,
CAGrad, and GradNorm, in their original implementations are computationally
demanding, which significantly limits their application in modern large models
and transformers. We propose Gradient Conductor (GCond), a method that builds
upon PCGrad principles by combining them with gradient accumulation and an
adaptive arbitration mechanism. We evaluated GCond on self-supervised learning
tasks using MobileNetV3-Small and ConvNeXt architectures on the ImageNet 1K
dataset and a combined head and neck CT scan dataset, comparing the proposed
method against baseline linear combinations and state-of-the-art gradient
conflict resolution methods. The stochastic mode of GCond achieved a two-fold
computational speedup while maintaining optimization quality, and demonstrated
superior performance across all evaluated metrics, achieving lower L1 and SSIM
losses compared to other methods on both datasets. GCond exhibited high
scalability, being successfully applied to both compact models
(MobileNetV3-Small) and large architectures (ConvNeXt-tiny and ConvNeXt-Base).
It also showed compatibility with modern optimizers such as AdamW and
Lion/LARS. Therefore, GCond offers a scalable and efficient solution to the
problem of gradient conflicts in multi-task learning.

Abstract: We introduce a robust framework for learning various generalized Hamiltonian
dynamics from noisy, sparse phase-space data and in an unsupervised manner
based on variational Bayesian inference. Although conservative, dissipative,
and port-Hamiltonian systems might share the same initial total energy of a
closed system, it is challenging for a single Hamiltonian network model to
capture the distinctive and varying motion dynamics and physics of a phase
space, from sampled observational phase space trajectories. To address this
complicated Hamiltonian manifold learning challenge, we extend sparse
symplectic, random Fourier Gaussian processes learning with predictive
successive numerical estimations of the Hamiltonian landscape, using a
generalized form of state and conjugate momentum Hamiltonian dynamics,
appropriate to different classes of conservative, dissipative and
port-Hamiltonian physical systems. In addition to the kernelized evidence lower
bound (ELBO) loss for data fidelity, we incorporate stability and conservation
constraints as additional hyper-parameter balanced loss terms to regularize the
model's multi-gradients, enforcing physics correctness for improved prediction
accuracy with bounded uncertainty.

Motivation: 密码解密任务作为研究神经网络在组合复杂领域中泛化能力的理想测试平台，需要从26!种可能的映射中选择正确的密码映射。

Method: 开发了ALICE架构，使用编码器Transformer和基于Gumbel-Sinkhorn方法的双射解码头来显式建模排列，实现可解释的密码映射提取。

Result: ALICE在仅训练约1500个独特密码（占可能密码空间的极小部分3.7×10^{-24}）后就能泛化到未见过的密码，在准确性和速度上都达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该架构和分析方法可扩展到任何具有双射映射和组合结构的领域，为神经网络泛化和可解释性提供了新的见解，并揭示了模型预测过程与人类解密策略的相似性。

Abstract: We present cryptogram solving as an ideal testbed for studying neural network
generalization in combinatorially complex domains. In this task, models must
decrypt text encoded with substitution ciphers, choosing from 26! possible
mappings without explicit access to the cipher. We develop ALICE (an
Architecture for Learning Interpretable Cryptogram dEcipherment): a simple
encoder-only Transformer that sets a new state-of-the-art for both accuracy and
speed on this decryption problem. Surprisingly, ALICE generalizes to unseen
ciphers after training on only ${\sim}1500$ unique ciphers, a minute fraction
($3.7 \times 10^{-24}$) of the possible cipher space. To enhance
interpretability, we introduce a novel bijective decoding head that explicitly
models permutations via the Gumbel-Sinkhorn method, enabling direct extraction
of learned cipher mappings. Through early exit analysis, we reveal how ALICE
progressively refines its predictions in a way that appears to mirror common
human strategies for this task: early layers employ frequency-based heuristics,
middle layers form word structures, and final layers correct individual
characters. Our architectural innovations and analysis methods extend beyond
cryptograms to any domain with bijective mappings and combinatorial structure,
offering new insights into neural network generalization and interpretability.

Conclusion: 建立了临床可行的LLM指南遵循系统框架，平衡准确性、可解释性和监管要求，为自动化临床决策支持提供可扩展路径。

Abstract: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) provides evidence-based
guidelines for cancer treatment. Translating complex patient presentations into
guideline-compliant treatment recommendations is time-intensive, requires
specialized expertise, and is prone to error. Advances in large language model
(LLM) capabilities promise to reduce the time required to generate treatment
recommendations and improve accuracy. We present an LLM agent-based approach to
automatically generate guideline-concordant treatment trajectories for patients
with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our contributions are threefold.
First, we construct a novel longitudinal dataset of 121 cases of NSCLC patients
that includes clinical encounters, diagnostic results, and medical histories,
each expertly annotated with the corresponding NCCN guideline trajectories by
board-certified oncologists. Second, we demonstrate that existing LLMs possess
domain-specific knowledge that enables high-quality proxy benchmark generation
for both model development and evaluation, achieving strong correlation
(Spearman coefficient r=0.88, RMSE = 0.08) with expert-annotated benchmarks.
Third, we develop a hybrid approach combining expensive human annotations with
model consistency information to create both the agent framework that predicts
the relevant guidelines for a patient, as well as a meta-classifier that
verifies prediction accuracy with calibrated confidence scores for treatment
recommendations (AUROC=0.800), a critical capability for communicating the
accuracy of outputs, custom-tailoring tradeoffs in performance, and supporting
regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for clinically viable
LLM-based guideline adherence systems that balance accuracy, interpretability,
and regulatory requirements while reducing annotation costs, providing a
scalable pathway toward automated clinical decision support.

Conclusion: 针对表格人口统计属性的基础模型可以跨任务和人群泛化，为提升医疗预测性能提供了有前景的方向

Abstract: Demographic attributes are universally present in electronic health records
and serve as vital predictors in clinical risk stratification and treatment
decisions. Despite their significance, these attributes are often relegated to
auxiliary roles in model design, with limited attention has been given to
learning their representations. This study proposes a General Demographic
Pre-trained (GDP) model as a foundational representation framework tailored to
age and gender. The model is pre-trained and evaluated using datasets with
diverse diseases and population compositions from different geographic regions.
The GDP architecture explores combinations of ordering strategies and encoding
methods to transform tabular demographic inputs into latent embeddings.
Experimental results demonstrate that sequential ordering substantially
improves model performance in discrimination, calibration, and the
corresponding information gain at each decision tree split, particularly in
diseases where age and gender contribute significantly to risk stratification.
Even in datasets where demographic attributes hold relatively low predictive
value, GDP enhances the representational importance, increasing their influence
in downstream gradient boosting models. The findings suggest that foundational
models for tabular demographic attributes can generalize across tasks and
populations, offering a promising direction for improving predictive
performance in healthcare applications.

most existing studies assume static datasets, in real-world scenarios clients
may continuously collect data with time-varying and non-independent and
identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) characteristics. A critical challenge is
how to adapt models in a timely yet efficient manner to such evolving data. In
this paper, we propose FedTeddi, a temporal-drift-and-divergence-aware
scheduling algorithm that facilitates fast convergence of FEEL under dynamic
data evolution and communication resource limits. We first quantify the
temporal dynamics and non-i.i.d. characteristics of data using temporal drift
and collective divergence, respectively, and represent them as the Earth
Mover's Distance (EMD) of class distributions for classification tasks. We then
propose a novel optimization objective and develop a joint scheduling and
bandwidth allocation algorithm, enabling the FEEL system to learn from new data
quickly without forgetting previous knowledge. Experimental results show that
our algorithm achieves higher test accuracy and faster convergence compared to
benchmark methods, improving the rate of convergence by 58.4% on CIFAR-10 and
49.2% on CIFAR-100 compared to random scheduling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SBS是一种参数高效的神经表示增强方法，通过抑制频谱偏差来改进神经网络权重的压缩重建效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的神经网络权重隐式表示存在明显的频谱偏差，难以有效重建高频细节，限制了参数压缩的效果

Method: 提出两种技术：1）基于单向排序的平滑化改进输出空间核平滑度；2）基于单向排序平滑感知的随机傅里叶特征，根据层间参数数量自适应调节输入编码的频率带宽

Result: 在多种ResNet模型和CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet数据集上的广泛评估显示，SBS以更少的参数实现了显著更好的重建精度

Conclusion: SBS方法有效抑制了频谱偏差，在神经网络权重压缩方面优于现有技术，实现了更好的参数效率

Abstract: Implicit neural representations have recently been extended to represent
convolutional neural network weights via neural representation for neural
networks, offering promising parameter compression benefits. However, standard
multi-layer perceptrons used in neural representation for neural networks
exhibit a pronounced spectral bias, hampering their ability to reconstruct
high-frequency details effectively. In this paper, we propose SBS, a
parameter-efficient enhancement to neural representation for neural networks
that suppresses spectral bias using two techniques: (1) a unidirectional
ordering-based smoothing that improves kernel smoothness in the output space,
and (2) unidirectional ordering-based smoothing aware random fourier features
that adaptively modulate the frequency bandwidth of input encodings based on
layer-wise parameter count. Extensive evaluations on various ResNet models with
datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, demonstrate that SBS achieves
significantly better reconstruction accuracy with less parameters compared to
SOTA.

Abstract: Cardiac arrest is one of the biggest global health problems, and early
identification and management are key to enhancing the patient's prognosis. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines an EfficientNet-based
deep learning model with a digital twin system to improve the early detection
and analysis of cardiac arrest. We use compound scaling and EfficientNet to
learn the features of cardiovascular images. In parallel, the digital twin
creates a realistic and individualized cardiovascular system model of the
patient based on data received from the Internet of Things (IoT) devices
attached to the patient, which can help in the constant assessment of the
patient and the impact of possible treatment plans. As shown by our
experiments, the proposed system is highly accurate in its prediction abilities
and, at the same time, efficient. Combining highly advanced techniques such as
deep learning and digital twin (DT) technology presents the possibility of
using an active and individual approach to predicting cardiac disease.

characteristics during inference along with outlier-detection, EMORF-II has
improved outlier-mitigation capability. Numerical experiments confirm

TL;DR: 提出了DPH-RL框架，通过使用mass-covering f-divergences（如前向KL和JS散度）作为排练机制，解决RLVR微调中多尝试性能退化问题，同时提升单尝试和多尝试性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RL微调LLMs时出现的多尝试性能(Pass@k)退化问题，以及灾难性遗忘现象，现有方法缺乏对散度项选择和功能的系统性研究。

Method: 提出DPH-RL框架，使用mass-covering f-divergences（前向KL和JS散度）作为排练机制，持续参考初始策略来保持广泛的解决方案覆盖。

Result: 在数学和SQL生成任务上的实验表明，DPH-RL不仅解决了Pass@k退化问题，还同时提升了域内和域外的Pass@1和Pass@k性能，且训练效率更高。

Conclusion: 散度度量的正确选择是改进RLVR的关键因素，能够构建更通用和多样化的推理模型。

Abstract: A central paradox in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) is the frequent
degradation of multi-attempt performance (Pass@k) despite improvements in
single-attempt accuracy (Pass@1). This is often accompanied by catastrophic
forgetting, where models lose previously acquired skills. While various methods
have been proposed, the choice and function of the divergence term have been
surprisingly unexamined as a proactive solution. We argue that standard RLVR
objectives -- both those using the mode-seeking reverse KL-divergence and those
forgoing a divergence term entirely -- lack a crucial mechanism for knowledge
retention. The reverse-KL actively accelerates this decay by narrowing the
policy, while its absence provides no safeguard against the model drifting from
its diverse knowledge base. We propose a fundamental shift in perspective:
using the divergence term itself as the solution. Our framework,
Diversity-Preserving Hybrid RL (DPH-RL), leverages mass-covering f-divergences
(like forward-KL and JS-divergence) to function as a rehearsal mechanism. By
continuously referencing the initial policy, this approach forces the model to
maintain broad solution coverage. Extensive experiments on math and SQL
generation demonstrate that DPH-RL not only resolves the Pass@k degradation but
improves both Pass@1 and Pass@k in- and out-of-domain. Additionally, DPH-RL is
more training-efficient because it computes f-divergence using generator
functions, requiring only sampling from the initial policy and no online
reference model. Our work highlights a crucial, overlooked axis for improving
RLVR, demonstrating that the proper selection of a divergence measure is a
powerful tool for building more general and diverse reasoning models.

Motivation: 解决现有推荐系统模型在同时处理显式评分和隐式反馈方面的不足，以及缺乏对自动编码器在推荐系统中的理论证明。

Method: 设计了一种新的卷积自动编码器结构，能够同时学习不同交互类型的关联关系，并进行分离预测（消费概率和高评分概率）。提供了泛化界限证明和损失函数优化的理论保障。

Conclusion: 该模型不仅在实践中表现优异，还提供了理论保障，能够识别用户可能会喜欢但不会自然消费的物品，为推荐系统提供了更加全面的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a new convolutional AutoEncoder architecture for user modelling
and recommendation tasks with several improvements over the state of the art.
Firstly, our model has the flexibility to learn a set of associations and
combinations between different interaction types in a way that carries over to
each user and item. Secondly, our model is able to learn jointly from both the
explicit ratings and the implicit information in the sampling pattern (which we
refer to as `implicit feedback'). It can also make separate predictions for the
probability of consuming content and the likelihood of granting it a high
rating if observed. This not only allows the model to make predictions for both
the implicit and explicit feedback, but also increases the informativeness of
the predictions: in particular, our model can identify items which users would
not have been likely to consume naturally, but would be likely to enjoy if
exposed to them. Finally, we provide several generalization bounds for our
model, which to the best of our knowledge, are among the first generalization
bounds for auto-encoders in a Recommender Systems setting; we also show that
optimizing our loss function guarantees the recovery of the exact sampling
distribution over interactions up to a small error in total variation. In
experiments on several real-life datasets, we achieve state-of-the-art
performance on both the implicit and explicit feedback prediction tasks despite
relying on a single model for both, and benefiting from additional
interpretability in the form of individual predictions for the probabilities of
each possible rating.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了短期水需求预测的准确性，还能够识别具体的消费行为模式，为水资源管理提供了更深入的见解。

Abstract: Advancements in smart metering technologies have significantly improved the
ability to monitor and manage water utilities. In the context of increasing
uncertainty due to climate change, securing water resources and supply has
emerged as an urgent global issue with extensive socioeconomic ramifications.
Hourly consumption data from end-users have yielded substantial insights for
projecting demand across regions characterized by diverse consumption patterns.
Nevertheless, the prediction of water demand remains challenging due to
influencing non-deterministic factors, such as meteorological conditions. This
work introduces a novel method for short-term water demand forecasting for
District Metered Areas (DMAs) which encompass commercial, agricultural, and
residential consumers. Unsupervised contrastive learning is applied to
categorize end-users according to distinct consumption behaviors present within
a DMA. Subsequently, the distinct consumption behaviors are utilized as
features in the ensuing demand forecasting task using wavelet-transformed
convolutional networks that incorporate a cross-attention mechanism combining
both historical data and the derived representations. The proposed approach is
evaluated on real-world DMAs over a six-month period, demonstrating improved
forecasting performance in terms of MAPE across different DMAs, with a maximum
improvement of 4.9%. Additionally, it identifies consumers whose behavior is
shaped by socioeconomic factors, enhancing prior knowledge about the
deterministic patterns that influence demand.

Motivation: 在大规模信号中识别重复模式和罕见事件是天文学、物理模拟和生物医学等领域的基础挑战。卷积字典学习(CDL)虽然能有效建模信号局部结构，但在罕见事件检测方面存在高计算成本和对异常敏感的局限性。

Conclusion: RoseCDL为现实世界信号中的事件发现和表征提供了实用的CDL框架，扩展了其在罕见事件检测中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Identifying recurring patterns and rare events in large-scale signals is a
fundamental challenge in fields such as astronomy, physical simulations, and
biomedical science. Convolutional Dictionary Learning (CDL) offers a powerful
framework for modeling local structures in signals, but its use for detecting
rare or anomalous events remains largely unexplored. In particular, CDL faces
two key challenges in this setting: high computational cost and sensitivity to
artifacts and outliers. In this paper, we introduce RoseCDL, a scalable and
robust CDL algorithm designed for unsupervised rare event detection in long
signals. RoseCDL combines stochastic windowing for efficient training on large
datasets with inline outlier detection to enhance robustness and isolate
anomalous patterns. This reframes CDL as a practical tool for event discovery
and characterization in real-world signals, extending its role beyond
traditional tasks like compression or denoising.

Result: 实验结果显示方法在不同模型规模、最大长度和任务上都能一致获得更优的结果

Conclusion: δL正则化是一种简单有效的损失聚合方法，能够有效解决RLVR中动态长度导致的梯度方差问题，提供理论保证的无偏估计和最小方差

Abstract: We propose $\Delta L$ Normalization, a simple yet effective loss aggregation
method tailored to the characteristic of dynamic generation lengths in
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Recently, RLVR has
demonstrated strong potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but a major challenge lies in the large variability of
response lengths during training, which leads to high gradient variance and
unstable optimization. Although previous methods such as GRPO, DAPO, and Dr.
GRPO introduce different loss normalization terms to address this issue, they
either produce biased estimates or still suffer from high gradient variance. By
analyzing the effect of varying lengths on policy loss both theoretically and
empirically, we reformulate the problem as finding a minimum-variance unbiased
estimator. Our proposed $\Delta L$ Normalization not only provides an unbiased
estimate of the true policy loss but also minimizes gradient variance in
theory. Extensive experiments show that it consistently achieves superior
results across different model sizes, maximum lengths, and tasks. Our code will
be made public at https://github.com/zerolllin/Delta-L-Normalization.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Univariate Gaussian Mixture Model Neural Network
(uGMM-NN), a novel neural architecture that embeds probabilistic reasoning
directly into the computational units of deep networks. Unlike traditional
neurons, which apply weighted sums followed by fixed nonlinearities, each
uGMM-NN node parameterizes its activations as a univariate Gaussian mixture,
with learnable means, variances, and mixing coefficients. This design enables
richer representations by capturing multimodality and uncertainty at the level
of individual neurons, while retaining the scalability of standard feedforward
networks. We demonstrate that uGMM-NN can achieve competitive discriminative
performance compared to conventional multilayer perceptrons, while additionally
offering a probabilistic interpretation of activations. The proposed framework
provides a foundation for integrating uncertainty-aware components into modern
neural architectures, opening new directions for both discriminative and
generative modeling.

Method: 引入PINN框架的双重公式化方法，包括强形式和变分（弱）形式，比较标准PINN与变分PINN（VPINN）在不同测试函数下的表现

Conclusion: 双重公式化可作为收敛质量的可靠指标，将其集成到PINN框架中增强了在微观力学均匀化问题中的适用性

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise in solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) relevant to multiscale modeling, but they
often fail when applied to materials with discontinuous coefficients, such as
media with piecewise constant properties. This paper introduces a dual
formulation for the PINN framework to improve the reliability of the
homogenization of periodic thermo-conductive composites, for both strong and
variational (weak) formulations. The dual approach facilitates the derivation
of guaranteed upper and lower error bounds, enabling more robust detection of
PINN failure. We compare standard PINNs applied to smoothed material
approximations with variational PINNs (VPINNs) using both spectral and neural
network-based test functions. Our results indicate that while strong-form PINNs
may outperform VPINNs in controlled settings, they are sensitive to material
discontinuities and may fail without clear diagnostics. In contrast, VPINNs
accommodate piecewise constant material parameters directly but require careful
selection of test functions to avoid instability. Dual formulation serves as a
reliable indicator of convergence quality, and its integration into PINN
frameworks enhances their applicability to homogenization problems in
micromechanics.

Abstract: This paper presents an innovative Transformer-based deep learning strategy
for optimizing the placement of sensors aiming at structural health monitoring

robustness is confirmed through a rigorous framework of 3 repetitions of
10-fold stratified cross-validation. The attention mechanism also pinpoints

Abstract: Class imbalance poses a significant challenge to supervised classification,
particularly in critical domains like medical diagnostics and anomaly detection
where minority class instances are rare. While numerous studies have explored
rebalancing techniques to address this issue, less attention has been given to
evaluating the performance of binary classifiers under imbalance when no such
techniques are applied. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the
performance of binary classifiers "as-is", without performing any explicit
rebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a
diverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic
datasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and
few-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data
complexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate
real-world conditions. In addition to standard classifiers, we include
experiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class
classification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance.
The results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data
complexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional
classifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN
and boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better
generalization compared to traditional classifiers. Visual interpretability and
evaluation metrics further validate these findings. Our work offers valuable
guidance on model selection for imbalanced learning, providing insights into
classifier robustness without dependence on explicit rebalancing techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集成梯度(IG)方法假设数据是连续的，而图是离散结构，因此IG不适用于图数据。需要开发专门针对图结构的解释性方法

Method: 开发了图集成梯度(GB-IG)方法，扩展了IG算法使其适用于图结构数据，能够识别图中关键的结构组件

Abstract: Integrated Gradients (IG) is a common explainability technique to address the
black-box problem of neural networks. Integrated gradients assumes continuous
data. Graphs are discrete structures making IG ill-suited to graphs. In this
work, we introduce graph-based integrated gradients (GB-IG); an extension of IG
to graphs. We demonstrate on four synthetic datasets that GB-IG accurately
identifies crucial structural components of the graph used in classification
tasks. We further demonstrate on three prevalent real-world graph datasets that
GB-IG outperforms IG in highlighting important features for node classification
tasks.

Abstract: Neighbour embeddings (NE) allow the representation of high dimensional
datasets into lower dimensional spaces and are often used in data
visualisation. In practice, accelerated approximations are employed to handle
very large datasets. Accelerating NE is challenging, and two main directions
have been explored: very coarse approximations based on negative sampling (as
in UMAP) achieve high effective speed but may lack quality in the extracted
structures; less coarse approximations, as used in FIt-SNE or BH-t-SNE, offer
better structure preservation at the cost of speed, while also restricting the
target dimensionality to 2 or 3, limiting NE to visualisation. In some
variants, the precision of these costlier accelerations also enables
finer-grained control on the extracted structures through dedicated
hyperparameters.
  This paper proposes to bridge the gab between both approaches by introducing
a novel way to accelerate NE, requiring a small number of computations per
iteration while maintaining good fine-grained structure preservation and
flexibility through hyperparameter tuning, without limiting the dimensionality
of the embedding space. The method was designed for interactive exploration of
data; as such, it abandons the traditional two-phased approach of other NE
methods, allowing instantaneous visual feedback when changing hyperparameters,
even when these control processes happening on the high-dimensional side of the
computations. Experiments using a publicly available, GPU accelerated GUI
integration of the method show promising results in terms of speed, flexibility
in the structures getting extracted, and show potential uses in broader machine
learning contexts with minimal algorithmic modifications. Central to this
algorithm is a novel approach to iterative approximate nearest neighbour
search, which shows promising results compared to nearest neighbour descent.

TL;DR: IBN网络通过不确定性感知插值和双向建模，解决了多元时间序列预测中变量缺失的问题，在多种缺失率场景下实现了最先进的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时空图神经网络在处理变量缺失问题时难以建模变量间相关性，现有方法GinAR缺乏可解释性且无法捕捉潜在时间模式。

Method: 提出可解释双向建模网络(IBN)，包含不确定性感知插值(UAI)和基于高斯核的图卷积(GGCN)，使用MC Dropout估计重构值的不确定性，并采用双向递归单元增强时间依赖性建模。

Result: 大量实验表明IBN在各种缺失率场景下都达到了最先进的预测性能。

Conclusion: IBN为带有缺失变量的多元时间序列预测提供了一个更可靠和可解释的框架。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) often faces challenges from
missing variables, which hinder conventional spatial-temporal graph neural
networks in modeling inter-variable correlations. While GinAR addresses
variable missing using attention-based imputation and adaptive graph learning
for the first time, it lacks interpretability and fails to capture more latent
temporal patterns due to its simple recursive units (RUs). To overcome these
limitations, we propose the Interpretable Bidirectional-modeling Network (IBN),
integrating Uncertainty-Aware Interpolation (UAI) and Gaussian kernel-based
Graph Convolution (GGCN). IBN estimates the uncertainty of reconstructed values
using MC Dropout and applies an uncertainty-weighted strategy to mitigate
high-risk reconstructions. GGCN explicitly models spatial correlations among
variables, while a bidirectional RU enhances temporal dependency modeling.
Extensive experiments show that IBN achieves state-of-the-art forecasting
performance under various missing-rate scenarios, providing a more reliable and
interpretable framework for MTSF with missing variables. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 使用误差有界压缩算法压缩MoE模型中的非激活专家，减少GPU内存与主存间的数据传输开销，并分析不同层次专家压缩误差对推理精度的影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着MoE模型在LLM学习中的广泛应用，在有限GPU内存约束下高效服务MoE模型成为重要挑战。将非激活专家卸载到主存是有效方法，但带来了专家数据传输的挑战

Method: 提出使用误差有界损失压缩算法（如SZ3和CuSZp）压缩非激活专家，在各种基准测试上进行广泛实验，全面分析不同专家压缩误差对推理精度的影响

Result: 浅层专家（主要负责注意力机制和输入标记向量化）在误差有界压缩下推理精度下降最小；中间层专家（模型推理核心）的误差会显著损害推理精度；深层专家（指令跟随和输出整合）的有界误差有时反而能提高推理精度

Conclusion: 误差有界压缩是减少MoE推理中数据传输开销的有效方法，但需要针对不同层次专家的功能特点采用差异化的压缩策略

Abstract: With the widespread application of Mixture of Experts (MoE) reasoning models
in the field of LLM learning, efficiently serving MoE models under limited GPU
memory constraints has emerged as a significant challenge. Offloading the
non-activated experts to main memory has been identified as an efficient
approach to address such a problem, while it brings the challenges of
transferring the expert between the GPU memory and main memory. We need to
explore an efficient approach to compress the expert and analyze how the
compression error affects the inference performance.
  To bridge this gap, we propose employing error-bounded lossy compression
algorithms (such as SZ3 and CuSZp) to compress non-activated experts, thereby
reducing data transfer overhead during MoE inference. We conduct extensive
experiments across various benchmarks and present a comprehensive analysis of
how compression-induced errors in different experts affect overall inference
accuracy. The results indicate that experts in the shallow layers, which are
primarily responsible for the attention mechanism and the transformation of
input tokens into vector representations, exhibit minimal degradation in
inference accuracy when subjected to bounded errors. In contrast, errors in the
middle-layer experts, which are central to model reasoning, significantly
impair inference accuracy. Interestingly, introducing bounded errors in the
deep-layer experts, which are mainly responsible for instruction following and
output integration, can sometimes lead to improvements in inference accuracy.

architectures and input structures, this study highlights the importance of
ensemble forecasting in conflict modeling, and the value of publicly available
OSINT data in quantifying material degradation over time.

Conclusion: 逆问题方法可以高效地揭示缩放定律，为构建高性能LLM提供经济有效的指导

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are large-scale pretrained models that have
achieved remarkable success across diverse domains. These successes have been
driven by unprecedented complexity and scale in both data and computations.
However, due to the high costs of training such models, brute-force
trial-and-error approaches to improve LLMs are not feasible. Inspired by the
success of inverse problems in uncovering fundamental scientific laws, this
position paper advocates that inverse problems can also efficiently uncover
scaling laws that guide the building of LLMs to achieve the desirable
performance with significantly better cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: Predicting injuries and fatalities in traffic crashes plays a critical role
in enhancing road safety, improving emergency response, and guiding public
health interventions. This study investigates the added value of unstructured
crash narratives (written by police officers at the scene) when combined with
structured crash data to predict injury severity. Two widely used Natural
Language Processing (NLP) techniques, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency
(TF-IDF) and Word2Vec, were employed to extract semantic meaning from the
narratives, and their effectiveness was compared. To address the challenge of
class imbalance, a K-Nearest Neighbors-based oversampling method was applied to
the training data prior to modeling. The dataset consists of crash records from
Kentucky spanning 2019 to 2023. To account for roadway heterogeneity, three
road classification schemes were used: (1) eight detailed functional classes
(e.g., Urban Two-Lane, Rural Interstate, Urban Multilane Divided), (2) four
broader paired categories (e.g., Urban vs. Rural, Freeway vs. Non-Freeway), and
(3) a unified dataset without classification. A total of 102 machine learning
models were developed by combining structured features and narrative-based
features using the two NLP techniques alongside three ensemble algorithms:
XGBoost, Random Forest, and AdaBoost. Results demonstrate that models
incorporating narrative data consistently outperform those relying solely on
structured data. Among all combinations, TF-IDF coupled with XGBoost yielded
the most accurate predictions in most subgroups. The findings highlight the
power of integrating textual and structured crash information to enhance
person-level injury prediction. This work offers a practical and adaptable
framework for transportation safety professionals to improve crash severity
modeling, guide policy decisions, and design more effective countermeasures.

Motivation: 个性化癌症聚合疗法面临巨大的药物和杏量组合空间，实验数量有限且分子描述信息获取困难，导致冷启动问题：如何在无病人信息时选择最有信息的初始测试组合

Result: 在大规模药物组合数据集上的回顾性模拟显示，该方法显著提高了初始筛选效率，超过基线方法

Conclusion: 该策略为个性化聚合药物筛选提供了可行的早期决策路径，有效解决了冷启动问题，推进个性化癌症治疗的早期决策

Abstract: Personalizing combination therapies in oncology requires navigating an
immense space of possible drug and dose combinations, a task that remains
largely infeasible through exhaustive experimentation. Recent developments in
patient-derived models have enabled high-throughput ex vivo screening, but the
number of feasible experiments is limited. Further, a tight therapeutic window
makes gathering molecular profiling information (e.g. RNA-seq) impractical as a
means of guiding drug response prediction. This leads to a challenging
cold-start problem: how do we select the most informative combinations to test
early, when no prior information about the patient is available? We propose a
strategy that leverages a pretrained deep learning model built on historical
drug response data. The model provides both embeddings for drug combinations
and dose-level importance scores, enabling a principled selection of initial
experiments. We combine clustering of drug embeddings to ensure functional
diversity with a dose-weighting mechanism that prioritizes doses based on their
historical informativeness. Retrospective simulations on large-scale drug
combination datasets show that our method substantially improves initial
screening efficiency compared to baselines, offering a viable path for more
effective early-phase decision-making in personalized combination drug screens.

Conclusion: 该多组学SVR模型能够准确预测GTV连续变化，为PULSAR疗法的患者选择和治疗调整提供了量化和个性化的辅助决策方案

Abstract: Personalized ultra-fractionated stereotactic adaptive radiotherapy (PULSAR)
is a novel treatment that delivers radiation in pulses of protracted intervals.
Accurate prediction of gross tumor volume (GTV) changes through regression
models has substantial prognostic value. This study aims to develop a
multi-omics based support vector regression (SVR) model for predicting GTV
change. A retrospective cohort of 39 patients with 69 brain metastases was
analyzed, based on radiomics (MRI images) and dosiomics (dose maps) features.
Delta features were computed to capture relative changes between two time
points. A feature selection pipeline using least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator (Lasso) algorithm with weight- or frequency-based ranking
criterion was implemented. SVR models with various kernels were evaluated using
the coefficient of determination (R2) and relative root mean square error
(RRMSE). Five-fold cross-validation with 10 repeats was employed to mitigate
the limitation of small data size. Multi-omics models that integrate radiomics,
dosiomics, and their delta counterparts outperform individual-omics models.
Delta-radiomic features play a critical role in enhancing prediction accuracy
relative to features at single time points. The top-performing model achieves
an R2 of 0.743 and an RRMSE of 0.022. The proposed multi-omics SVR model shows
promising performance in predicting continuous change of GTV. It provides a
more quantitative and personalized approach to assist patient selection and
treatment adjustment in PULSAR.

Conclusion: 耳内电极作为一种低负担、舒适的睡眠监测方法具有巨大潜力，特别适用于检测用户入睡时刻以自动暂停媒体播放等消费级应用场景

Abstract: Automatic sleep staging typically relies on gold-standard EEG setups, which
are accurate but obtrusive and impractical for everyday use outside sleep
laboratories. This limits applicability in real-world settings, such as home
environments, where continuous, long-term monitoring is needed. Detecting sleep
onset is particularly relevant, enabling consumer applications (e.g.
automatically pausing media playback when the user falls asleep). Recent
research has shown correlations between in-ear EEG and full-scalp EEG for
various phenomena, suggesting wearable, in-ear devices could allow unobtrusive
sleep monitoring. We investigated the feasibility of using single-channel
in-ear electrophysiological (ExG) signals for automatic sleep staging in a
wearable device by conducting a sleep study with 11~participants (mean age:
24), using a custom earpiece with a dry eartip electrode (D\"atwyler SoftPulse)
as a measurement electrode in one ear and a reference in the other. Ground
truth sleep stages were obtained from an Apple Watch Ultra, validated for sleep
staging. Our system achieved 90.5% accuracy for binary sleep detection (Awake
vs. Asleep) and 65.1% accuracy for four-class staging (Awake, REM, Core, Deep)
using leave-one-subject-out validation. These findings demonstrate the
potential of in-ear electrodes as a low-effort, comfortable approach to sleep
monitoring, with applications such as stopping podcasts when users fall asleep.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of Online Convex-Concave Optimization,
which extends Online Convex Optimization to two-player time-varying
convex-concave games. The goal is to minimize the dynamic duality gap (D-DGap),
a critical performance measure that evaluates players' strategies against
arbitrary comparator sequences. Existing algorithms fail to deliver optimal
performance, particularly in stationary or predictable environments. To address
this, we propose a novel modular algorithm with three core components: an
Adaptive Module that dynamically adjusts to varying levels of non-stationarity,
a Multi-Predictor Aggregator that identifies the best predictor among multiple
candidates, and an Integration Module that effectively combines their
strengths. Our algorithm achieves a minimax optimal D-DGap upper bound, up to a
logarithmic factor, while also ensuring prediction error-driven D-DGap bounds.
The modular design allows for the seamless replacement of components that
regulate adaptability to dynamic environments, as well as the incorporation of
components that integrate ``side knowledge'' from multiple predictors.
Empirical results further demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the
proposed method.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs and ontologies represent entities and their relationships in
a structured way, having gained significance in the development of modern AI
applications. Integrating these semantic resources with machine learning models
often relies on knowledge graph embedding models to transform graph data into

retrain models for different tasks using the same data, thereby helping to
democratize AI development and enabling sustainable computing.
  In this paper, we present Bio-KGvec2go, an extension of the KGvec2go Web API,
designed to generate and serve knowledge graph embeddings for widely used

TL;DR: ScaleZero通过混合专家架构和动态参数缩放策略，解决了异构多任务学习中梯度冲突和模型可塑性损失问题，在多个基准测试中达到与专用单任务模型相当的性能，且仅需80%的环境交互步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多任务世界模型（如UniZero）在处理大规模异构环境时面临梯度冲突和模型可塑性损失的问题，限制了其样本和计算效率。

Method: 1. 采用混合专家（MoE）架构缓解梯度冲突；2. 引入基于LoRA的动态参数缩放（DPS）策略，根据任务进度逐步集成LoRA适配器，实现自适应知识保留和参数扩展。

Result: 在Atari、DMControl和Jericho等标准基准测试中，ScaleZero仅使用在线强化学习和单一模型，性能与专用单任务基线相当，结合DPS策略后仅需80%的环境交互步骤即可达到竞争性性能。

Conclusion: ScaleZero展示了在大规模多任务学习中有效处理异构任务的潜力，为解决梯度冲突和保持模型可塑性提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: In heterogeneous multi-task learning, tasks not only exhibit diverse
observation and action spaces but also vary substantially in intrinsic
difficulty. While conventional multi-task world models like UniZero excel in
single-task settings, we find that when handling large-scale heterogeneous
environments, gradient conflicts and the loss of model plasticity often
constrain their sample and computational efficiency. In this work, we address
these challenges from two perspectives: the single learning iteration and the
overall learning process. First, we investigate the impact of key design spaces
on extending UniZero to multi-task planning. We find that a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) architecture provides the most substantial performance gains by
mitigating gradient conflicts, leading to our proposed model,
\textit{ScaleZero}. Second, to dynamically balance the computational load
across the learning process, we introduce an online, LoRA-based \textit{dynamic
parameter scaling} (DPS) strategy. This strategy progressively integrates LoRA
adapters in response to task-specific progress, enabling adaptive knowledge
retention and parameter expansion. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks
such as Atari, DMControl (DMC), and Jericho demonstrate that ScaleZero, relying
exclusively on online reinforcement learning with one model, attains
performance on par with specialized single-task baselines. Furthermore, when
augmented with our dynamic parameter scaling strategy, our method achieves

TL;DR: 多模态多任务基础模型在教育领域遇到隐私和数据集中化挑战，本文提出联邦学习基础模型方案，通过协作训练保护隐私并支持个性化教育。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态多任务基础模型在教育领域部署时遇到的隐私法规、数据形成孤岛和领域特定数据穷乏问题，尽可能发挥AI在教育中的潜力。

Method: 提出联邦学习基础模型（M3T FedFMs）方案，将联邦学习与多模态多任务基础模型相结合，支持在分布式机构中进行协作性隐私保护训练。

Result: 识别了M3T FedFMs在教育领域的三大优势：隐私保护（本地化处理敏感数据）、个性化（模块化架构支持定制）、公平包容（支持资源突出机构参与）。

Conclusion: 指出了实际部署面临的五大研究挑战：跨机构异构隐私规定、数据模态特性不均匀、模型删除方法、持续学习框架和模型可解释性，需要集体解决以实现实际应用。

Abstract: Multi-modal multi-task (M3T) foundation models (FMs) have recently shown
transformative potential in artificial intelligence, with emerging applications
in education. However, their deployment in real-world educational settings is
hindered by privacy regulations, data silos, and limited domain-specific data
availability. We introduce M3T Federated Foundation Models (FedFMs) for
education: a paradigm that integrates federated learning (FL) with M3T FMs to
enable collaborative, privacy-preserving training across decentralized
institutions while accommodating diverse modalities and tasks. Subsequently,
this position paper aims to unveil M3T FedFMs as a promising yet underexplored
approach to the education community, explore its potentials, and reveal its
related future research directions. We outline how M3T FedFMs can advance three
critical pillars of next-generation intelligent education systems: (i) privacy
preservation, by keeping sensitive multi-modal student and institutional data
local; (ii) personalization, through modular architectures enabling tailored
models for students, instructors, and institutions; and (iii) equity and
inclusivity, by facilitating participation from underrepresented and
resource-constrained entities. We finally identify various open research
challenges, including studying of (i) inter-institution heterogeneous privacy
regulations, (ii) the non-uniformity of data modalities' characteristics, (iii)
the unlearning approaches for M3T FedFMs, (iv) the continual learning
frameworks for M3T FedFMs, and (v) M3T FedFM model interpretability, which must
be collectively addressed for practical deployment.

TL;DR: ACE方法通过自训练学习一致性概念来解决完全伪相关性问题，在多个基准测试中表现优异，且在语言模型对齐中展现潜力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络对伪相关性敏感，现有方法主要处理不完全伪相关，但完全伪相关情况下的正确泛化是根本性未指定的问题

Method: 提出学习一组与训练数据一致但在新未标记输入上做出不同预测的概念，采用鼓励自信和选择性分歧的自训练方法

Result: ACE在完全伪相关基准测试中匹配或超越现有方法，同时对不完全伪相关保持鲁棒性，在语言模型对齐中无需访问不可信测量即可实现竞争性性能

Conclusion: ACE在克服未指定问题方面取得重要进展，虽然仍有局限性，但为处理完全伪相关问题提供了更可配置和有效的方法

Abstract: Deep neural networks are notoriously sensitive to spurious correlations -
where a model learns a shortcut that fails out-of-distribution. Existing work
on spurious correlations has often focused on incomplete
correlations,leveraging access to labeled instances that break the correlation.
But in cases where the spurious correlations are complete, the correct
generalization is fundamentally \textit{underspecified}. To resolve this
underspecification, we propose learning a set of concepts that are consistent
with training data but make distinct predictions on a subset of novel unlabeled
inputs. Using a self-training approach that encourages \textit{confident} and
\textit{selective} disagreement, our method ACE matches or outperforms existing
methods on a suite of complete-spurious correlation benchmarks, while remaining
robust to incomplete spurious correlations. ACE is also more configurable than
prior approaches, allowing for straight-forward encoding of prior knowledge and
principled unsupervised model selection. In an early application to
language-model alignment, we find that ACE achieves competitive performance on
the measurement tampering detection benchmark \textit{without} access to
untrusted measurements. While still subject to important limitations, ACE
represents significant progress towards overcoming underspecification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于高效结构化矩阵（BTT和MLR）的新评分函数，解决了标准注意力机制的信息损失和距离依赖性计算偏差问题，在多个任务上表现优于标准注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准注意力机制的低维投影会导致高维输入信息损失，且对所有输入对使用相同的评分函数，缺乏对序列中相邻token的距离依赖性计算偏差。

Method: 提出了基于Block Tensor-Train (BTT)和Multi-Level Low Rank (MLR)等高效结构化矩阵的新评分函数，这些矩阵具有高秩并能编码距离依赖性计算偏差。

Result: 在高维输入的上下文回归任务中，新评分函数在固定计算预算下优于标准注意力；在语言建模中，MLR注意力相比标准注意力和滑动窗口注意力变体实现了更好的扩展规律；在长程时间序列预测中也显示出有希望的结果。

Conclusion: BTT和MLR属于能够编码全秩或距离依赖性计算偏差的高效结构化矩阵家族，有效解决了标准注意力的重要缺陷。

Abstract: The core component of attention is the scoring function, which transforms the
inputs into low-dimensional queries and keys and takes the dot product of each
pair. While the low-dimensional projection improves efficiency, it causes
information loss for certain tasks that have intrinsically high-dimensional
inputs. Additionally, attention uses the same scoring function for all input
pairs, without imposing a distance-dependent compute bias for neighboring
tokens in the sequence. In this work, we address these shortcomings by
proposing new scoring functions based on computationally efficient structured
matrices with high ranks, including Block Tensor-Train (BTT) and Multi-Level
Low Rank (MLR) matrices. On in-context regression tasks with high-dimensional
inputs, our proposed scoring functions outperform standard attention for any
fixed compute budget. On language modeling, a task that exhibits locality
patterns, our MLR-based attention method achieves improved scaling laws
compared to both standard attention and variants of sliding window attention.
Additionally, we show that both BTT and MLR fall under a broader family of
efficient structured matrices capable of encoding either full-rank or
distance-dependent compute biases, thereby addressing significant shortcomings
of standard attention. Finally, we show that MLR attention has promising
results for long-range time-series forecasting.

Method: 提出新的广义平滑性假设家族，在确定性和随机设置下分析梯度下降的收敛特性，验证学习率预热的效果

Result: 学习率预热一致地加速梯度下降收敛，在某些特定情况下可比非递增学习率计划快Θ(T)倍

Conclusion: 学习率预热策略在理论上具有明确的加速收敛优势，为实践中的成功提供了优化理论视角的解释

Abstract: Learning rate warmup is a popular and practical technique in training
large-scale deep neural networks. Despite the huge success in practice, the
theoretical advantages of this strategy of gradually increasing the learning
rate at the beginning of the training process have not been fully understood.
To resolve this gap between theory and practice, we first propose a novel
family of generalized smoothness assumptions, and validate its applicability
both theoretically and empirically. Under the novel smoothness assumption, we
study the convergence properties of gradient descent (GD) in both deterministic
and stochastic settings. It is shown that learning rate warmup consistently
accelerates GD, and GD with warmup can converge at most $\Theta(T)$ times
faster than with a non-increasing learning rate schedule in some specific
cases, providing insights into the benefits of this strategy from an
optimization theory perspective.

Conclusion: MoMA框架通过集成LLM和基于智能体的路由，有效解决了多样化查询的路由挑战，在保持高性能的同时实现了成本优化。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and domain-specific AI
agents has greatly expanded the ecosystem of AI-powered services. User queries,
however, are highly diverse and often span multiple domains and task types,
resulting in a complex and heterogeneous landscape. This diversity presents a
fundamental routing challenge: how to accurately direct each query to an
appropriate execution unit while optimizing both performance and efficiency. To
address this, we propose MoMA (Mixture of Models and Agents), a generalized
routing framework that integrates both LLM and agent-based routing. Built upon
a deep understanding of model and agent capabilities, MoMA effectively handles
diverse queries through precise intent recognition and adaptive routing
strategies, achieving an optimal balance between efficiency and cost.
Specifically, we construct a detailed training dataset to profile the
capabilities of various LLMs under different routing model structures,
identifying the most suitable tasks for each LLM. During inference, queries are
dynamically routed to the LLM with the best cost-performance efficiency. We
also introduce an efficient agent selection strategy based on a context-aware
state machine and dynamic masking. Experimental results demonstrate that the
MoMA router offers superior cost-efficiency and scalability compared to
existing approaches.

Abstract: Given a continuous finitely piecewise linear function $f:\mathbb{R}^{n_0} \to
\mathbb{R}$ and a fixed architecture $(n_0,\ldots,n_k;1)$ of feedforward ReLU
neural networks, the exact function realization problem is to determine when
some network with the given architecture realizes $f$. To develop a systematic
way to answer these questions, we establish a connection between toric geometry
and ReLU neural networks. This approach enables us to utilize numerous
structures and tools from algebraic geometry to study ReLU neural networks.
Starting with an unbiased ReLU neural network with rational weights, we define
the ReLU fan, the ReLU toric variety, and the ReLU Cartier divisor associated
with the network. This work also reveals the connection between the tropical
geometry and the toric geometry of ReLU neural networks. As an application of
the toric geometry framework, we prove a necessary and sufficient criterion of
functions realizable by unbiased shallow ReLU neural networks by computing
intersection numbers of the ReLU Cartier divisor and torus-invariant curves.

TL;DR: 提出基于QMeans聚类的量子bagging框架，通过无监督学习和量子采样技术增强对标签噪声的鲁棒性，在NISQ时代提升量子机器学习算法的噪声韧性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在噪声中等规模量子(NISQ)时代，开发具有噪声韧性的量子机器学习算法至关重要。传统基于监督学习的bagging方法对标签噪声敏感，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 使用QMeans聚类作为基学习器，结合量子bootstrapping（通过QRAM采样）和bagging聚合（多数投票），构建无监督量子bagging框架。

Result: 在噪声分类和回归任务上的模拟实验表明，该量子bagging算法性能与经典KMeans相当，且比监督bagging方法对标签噪声具有更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 无监督量子bagging框架在不可靠数据学习中展现出巨大潜力，为NISQ时代的量子机器学习提供了有效的噪声韧性解决方案。

Abstract: The development of noise-resilient quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms
is critical in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. In this work,
we propose a quantum bagging framework that uses QMeans clustering as the base
learner to reduce prediction variance and enhance robustness to label noise.
Unlike bagging frameworks built on supervised learners, our method leverages
the unsupervised nature of QMeans, combined with quantum bootstrapping via
QRAM-based sampling and bagging aggregation through majority voting. Through
extensive simulations on both noisy classification and regression tasks, we
demonstrate that the proposed quantum bagging algorithm performs comparably to
its classical counterpart using KMeans while exhibiting greater resilience to
label corruption than supervised bagging methods. This highlights the potential
of unsupervised quantum bagging in learning from unreliable data.

Conclusion: 研究结果凸显了近量子计算在图基无监督学习金融应用中的实际效用，为金融资产相关性聚类提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Clustering financial assets based on return correlations is a fundamental
task in portfolio optimization and statistical arbitrage. However, classical
clustering methods often fall short when dealing with signed correlation
structures, typically requiring lossy transformations and heuristic assumptions
such as a fixed number of clusters. In this work, we apply the Graph-based
Coalition Structure Generation algorithm (GCS-Q) to directly cluster signed,
weighted graphs without relying on such transformations. GCS-Q formulates each
partitioning step as a QUBO problem, enabling it to leverage quantum annealing
for efficient exploration of exponentially large solution spaces. We validate
our approach on both synthetic and real-world financial data, benchmarking
against state-of-the-art classical algorithms such as SPONGE and k-Medoids. Our
experiments demonstrate that GCS-Q consistently achieves higher clustering
quality, as measured by Adjusted Rand Index and structural balance penalties,
while dynamically determining the number of clusters. These results highlight
the practical utility of near-term quantum computing for graph-based
unsupervised learning in financial applications.

Conclusion: 量子机器学习与量子攻策评估的结合为加强学习领域带来了量子优势的新可能性，虽然实际应用仍面临技术挑战，但前景很有希望。

Abstract: Quantum policy evaluation (QPE) is a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm
which is quadratically more efficient than an analogous classical Monte Carlo
estimation. It makes use of a direct quantum mechanical realization of a finite
Markov decision process, in which the agent and the environment are modeled by
unitary operators and exchange states, actions, and rewards in superposition.
Previously, the quantum environment has been implemented and parametrized
manually for an illustrative benchmark using a quantum simulator. In this
paper, we demonstrate how these environment parameters can be learned from a
batch of classical observational data through quantum machine learning (QML) on
quantum hardware. The learned quantum environment is then applied in QPE to
also compute policy evaluations on quantum hardware. Our experiments reveal
that, despite challenges such as noise and short coherence times, the
integration of QML and QPE shows promising potential for achieving quantum
advantage in RL.

Abstract: Modern Large Language Model (LLM) serving systems increasingly support
interactive applications, like real-time chat assistants, code generation
tools, and agentic workflows. However, the soaring energy cost of LLM inference
presents a growing challenge for sustainable and cost-effective deployment.
This paper introduces VoltanaLLM, a system for SLO-aware, energy-efficient LLM
serving, built from a control theory perspective. VoltanaLLM co-designs
frequency scaling and request routing in emerging prefill/decode disaggregated
architectures, leveraging their decoupled execution to enable fine-grained
phase-specific control. It consists of a feedback-driven frequency controller
that dynamically adapts GPU frequency for prefill and decode phases, and a
state-space router that explores routing decisions across frequency-scaled
instances to minimize energy under latency constraints. We implement VoltanaLLM
in SGLang and evaluate its performance over multiple state-of-the-art LLMs and
real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that VoltanaLLM achieves up to
36.3% energy savings while maintaining near-perfect SLO attainment rate, paving

Abstract: GPU kernel optimization has long been a central challenge at the intersection
of high-performance computing and machine learning. Efficient kernels are
crucial for accelerating large language model (LLM) training and serving, yet
attaining high performance typically requires extensive manual tuning.
Compiler-based systems reduce some of this burden, but still demand substantial
manual design and engineering effort. Recently, researchers have explored using
LLMs for GPU kernel generation, though prior work has largely focused on
translating high-level PyTorch modules into CUDA code. In this work, we
introduce Astra, the first LLM-based multi-agent system for GPU kernel
optimization. Unlike previous approaches, Astra starts from existing CUDA
implementations extracted from SGLang, a widely deployed framework for serving
LLMs, rather than treating PyTorch modules as the specification. Within Astra,
specialized LLM agents collaborate through iterative code generation, testing,
profiling, and planning to produce kernels that are both correct and
high-performance. On kernels from SGLang, Astra achieves an average speedup of
1.32x using zero-shot prompting with OpenAI o4-mini. A detailed case study
further demonstrates that LLMs can autonomously apply loop transformations,
optimize memory access patterns, exploit CUDA intrinsics, and leverage fast
math operations to yield substantial performance gains. Our work highlights
multi-agent LLM systems as a promising new paradigm for GPU kernel
optimization.

Conclusion: 强化学习能够显著促进求解器调优并加速优化过程，为二次规划问题的高精度求解提供了有效的数据驱动解决方案

Abstract: Quadratic programming is a workhorse of modern nonlinear optimization,
control, and data science. Although regularized methods offer convergence
guarantees under minimal assumptions on the problem data, they can exhibit the
slow tail-convergence typical of first-order schemes, thus requiring many
iterations to achieve high-accuracy solutions. Moreover, hyperparameter tuning
significantly impacts on the solver performance but how to find an appropriate
parameter configuration remains an elusive research question. To address these
issues, we explore how data-driven approaches can accelerate the solution
process. Aiming at high-accuracy solutions, we focus on a stabilized
interior-point solver and carefully handle its two-loop flow and control
parameters. We will show that reinforcement learning can make a significant
contribution to facilitating the solver tuning and to speeding up the
optimization process. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, after a
lightweight training, the learned policy generalizes well to different problem
classes with varying dimensions and to various solver configurations.

Abstract: We study decentralized online Riemannian optimization over manifolds with
possibly positive curvature, going beyond the Hadamard manifold setting.
Decentralized optimization techniques rely on a consensus step that is well
understood in Euclidean spaces because of their linearity. However, in
positively curved Riemannian spaces, a main technical challenge is that
geodesic distances may not induce a globally convex structure. In this work, we
first analyze a curvature-aware Riemannian consensus step that enables a linear
convergence beyond Hadamard manifolds. Building on this step, we establish a
$O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound for the decentralized online Riemannian gradient
descent algorithm. Then, we investigate the two-point bandit feedback setup,
where we employ computationally efficient gradient estimators using smoothing
techniques, and we demonstrate the same $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound through the
subconvexity analysis of smoothed objectives.

TL;DR: Falcon3-Audio是一个基于指令调优LLM和Whisper编码器的音频-语言模型家族，仅使用不到30K小时公开音频数据，在MMAU基准测试中达到64.14分，与R1-AQA相当，但具有更好的数据和参数效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管音频在人类交流中至关重要，但大型语言模型与音频的整合仍未被充分探索。

Method: 基于指令调优的LLM和Whisper编码器构建音频-语言模型，使用少量公开音频数据（<30K小时）进行单阶段训练。

Result: 7B模型在MMAU基准测试中获得64.14分，与最佳开源模型性能相当；1B模型仍能与2B-13B参数模型竞争。研究发现课程学习、多音频编码器和复杂交叉注意力连接器等常见复杂性并非必需。

Conclusion: Falcon3-Audio展示了在有限数据下实现强大音频-语言模型性能的可能性，挑战了需要大量数据和复杂架构的传统观念。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed NLP, yet their integration with
audio remains underexplored -- despite audio's centrality to human
communication. We introduce Falcon3-Audio, a family of Audio-Language Models
(ALMs) built on instruction-tuned LLMs and Whisper encoders. Using a remarkably
small amount of public audio data -- less than 30K hours (5K unique) --
Falcon3-Audio-7B matches the best reported performance among open-weight models
on the MMAU benchmark, with a score of 64.14, matching R1-AQA, while
distinguishing itself through superior data and parameter efficiency,
single-stage training, and transparency. Notably, our smallest 1B model remains
competitive with larger open models ranging from 2B to 13B parameters. Through
extensive ablations, we find that common complexities -- such as curriculum
learning, multiple audio encoders, and intricate cross-attention connectors --
are not required for strong performance, even compared to models trained on
over 500K hours of data.

TL;DR: 通过显式条件作用于能量序列，实现了可控制的歌声合成，特别是音素级动态控制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有SVS系统依赖概率模型导致的精确控制不足问题，特别是动态特征控制

Method: 使用从真实语谱提取的能量序列作为显式条件，提出音素级能量序列用于用户友好控制

Result: 与基线模型和能量预测器模型相比，能量序列的均绝对误差减少超过50%，且不影响合成质量

Conclusion: 首次实现了SVS中用户驱动的动态控制，通过能量序列条件化提高了控制性和减少标注成本

Abstract: Controllable Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) aims to generate expressive
singing voices reflecting user intent. While recent SVS systems achieve high
audio quality, most rely on probabilistic modeling, limiting precise control
over attributes such as dynamics. We address this by focusing on dynamic
control--temporal loudness variation essential for musical expressiveness--and
explicitly condition the SVS model on energy sequences extracted from
ground-truth spectrograms, reducing annotation costs and improving
controllability. We also propose a phoneme-level energy sequence for
user-friendly control. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt
enabling user-driven dynamics control in SVS. Experiments show our method
achieves over 50% reduction in mean absolute error of energy sequences for
phoneme-level inputs compared to baseline and energy-predictor models, without
compromising synthesis quality.

Conclusion: 这项研究不仅揭示了现有检测方法的漏洞，还为设计更健壮、通用的检测器提供了指导，并将指导未来研究开发能够有效应对不断发展的反例好技术的适应性防御策略。

Abstract: The widespread use of generative AI has shown remarkable success in producing
highly realistic deepfakes, posing a serious threat to various voice biometric
applications, including speaker verification, voice biometrics, audio
conferencing, and criminal investigations. To counteract this, several
state-of-the-art (SoTA) audio deepfake detection (ADD) methods have been
proposed to identify generative AI signatures to distinguish between real and
deepfake audio. However, the effectiveness of these methods is severely
undermined by anti-forensic (AF) attacks that conceal generative signatures.
These AF attacks span a wide range of techniques, including statistical
modifications (e.g., pitch shifting, filtering, noise addition, and
quantization) and optimization-based attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD, C \& W, and
DeepFool). In this paper, we investigate the SoTA ADD methods and provide a
comparative analysis to highlight their effectiveness in exposing deepfake
signatures, as well as their vulnerabilities under adversarial conditions. We
conducted an extensive evaluation of ADD methods on five deepfake benchmark
datasets using two categories: raw and spectrogram-based approaches. This
comparative analysis enables a deeper understanding of the strengths and
limitations of SoTA ADD methods against diverse AF attacks. It does not only
highlight vulnerabilities of ADD methods, but also informs the design of more
robust and generalized detectors for real-world voice biometrics. It will
further guide future research in developing adaptive defense strategies that
can effectively counter evolving AF techniques.

Motivation: 开发能够在嵌入式和IoT设备中高效运行的关键词检测技术，应对内存和能源约束的挑战。

Method: 系统性评估DS-CNN、LiCoNet、TENet等轻量级网络架构，提出基于MobileNet的TKWS架构，包含从MFCC特征提取到神经网络推理的整个处理流程，在三种STM32平台上进行测试。

Result: TKWS以仅14.4k参数达到92.4% F1分数，减少了内存占用。N6 MCU集成神经加速器获得最佳能源-延迟乘积，支持高效低延迟运行。

Conclusion: 模型准确性不是唯一决定因素，最佳关键词检测部署需要维度考虑特征提取参数和硬件特定优化。

Abstract: Keyword spotting (KWS) is a key enabling technology for hands-free
interaction in embedded and IoT devices, where stringent memory and energy
constraints challenge the deployment of AI-enabeld devices. In this work, we
systematically evaluate and compare several state-of-the-art lightweight neural
network architectures, including DS-CNN, LiCoNet, and TENet, alongside our
proposed Typman-KWS (TKWS) architecture built upon MobileNet, specifically
designed for efficient KWS on microcontroller units (MCUs). Unlike prior
studies focused solely on model inference, our analysis encompasses the entire
processing pipeline, from Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) feature
extraction to neural inference, and is benchmarked across three STM32 platforms
(N6, H7, and U5). Our results show that TKWS with three residual blocks
achieves up to 92.4% F1-score with only 14.4k parameters, reducing memory
footprint without compromising the accuracy. Moreover, the N6 MCU with
integrated neural acceleration achieves the best energy-delay product (EDP),
enabling efficient, low-latency operation even with high-resolution features.
Our findings highlight the model accuracy alone does not determine real-world
effectiveness; rather, optimal keyword spotting deployments require careful
consideration of feature extraction parameters and hardware-specific
optimization.

Method: 使用ESC-50数据集（2,000个标签环境音频录音），构建end-to-end深度学习流水线，测试多种谱特征包括mel谱图、MFCC、循环节奏图、STFT音阶图、CQT音阶图和CENS音阶图

Conclusion: 对于深度卷积神经网络音频分类任务，mel谱图和MFCC是最优的特征表示方式，性能显著超过其他谱和节奏特征

Abstract: Next to decision tree and k-nearest neighbours algorithms deep convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) are widely used to classify audio data in many domains
like music, speech or environmental sounds. To train a specific CNN various
spectral and rhythm features like mel-scaled spectrograms, mel-frequency
cepstral coefficients (MFCC), cyclic tempograms, short-time Fourier transform
(STFT) chromagrams, constant-Q transform (CQT) chromagrams and chroma energy
normalized statistics (CENS) chromagrams can be used as digital image input
data for the neural network. The performance of these spectral and rhythm
features for audio category level as well as audio class level classification
is investigated in detail with a deep CNN and the ESC-50 dataset with 2,000
labeled environmental audio recordings using an end-to-end deep learning
pipeline. The evaluated metrics accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score for
multiclass classification clearly show that the mel-scaled spectrograms and the
mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) perform significantly better then
the other spectral and rhythm features investigated in this research for audio
classification tasks using deep CNNs.

Abstract: Deep learning appears as an appealing solution for Automatic Synthesizer
Programming (ASP), which aims to assist musicians and sound designers in
programming sound synthesizers. However, integrating software synthesizers into
training pipelines is challenging due to their potential non-differentiability.
This work tackles this challenge by introducing a method to approximate
arbitrary synthesizers. Specifically, we train a neural network to map
synthesizer presets onto an audio embedding space derived from a pretrained
model. This facilitates the definition of a neural proxy that produces compact
yet effective representations, thereby enabling the integration of audio
embedding loss into neural-based ASP systems for black-box synthesizers. We
evaluate the representations derived by various pretrained audio models in the
context of neural-based nASP and assess the effectiveness of several neural
network architectures, including feedforward, recurrent, and transformer-based
models, in defining neural proxies. We evaluate the proposed method using both
synthetic and hand-crafted presets from three popular software synthesizers and
assess its performance in a synthesizer sound matching downstream task. While
the benefits of the learned representation are nuanced by resource
requirements, encouraging results were obtained for all synthesizers, paving
the way for future research into the application of synthesizer proxies for
neural-based ASP systems.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的语音认证系统攻击方法SMIA，通过在AI生成音频的不可听频率区域进行策略性操作，成功欺骗了现有的反欺骗防护措施，揭示了当前语音认证系统的安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音认证系统在高安全领域应用日益广泛，但面临深度伪造和对抗性攻击的严重威胁。现有的静态检测模型容易被新型对抗方法绕过，存在关键安全漏洞。

Method: 提出了频谱掩蔽和插值攻击(SMIA)方法，策略性地操纵AI生成音频中人耳不可感知的频率区域，创建听起来真实但能欺骗防护措施的对抗样本。

Result: SMIA在模拟真实世界条件下对最先进模型进行了全面评估：对组合VAS/CM系统的攻击成功率达到至少82%，对独立说话人验证系统达到至少97.5%，对防护措施达到100%。

Conclusion: 当前安全防护措施不足以应对自适应对抗攻击，迫切需要向下一代防御范式转变，采用能够随威胁环境演化的动态、上下文感知框架。

Abstract: Voice Authentication Systems (VAS) use unique vocal characteristics for
verification. They are increasingly integrated into high-security sectors such
as banking and healthcare. Despite their improvements using deep learning, they
face severe vulnerabilities from sophisticated threats like deepfakes and
adversarial attacks. The emergence of realistic voice cloning complicates
detection, as systems struggle to distinguish authentic from synthetic audio.
While anti-spoofing countermeasures (CMs) exist to mitigate these risks, many
rely on static detection models that can be bypassed by novel adversarial
methods, leaving a critical security gap. To demonstrate this vulnerability, we
propose the Spectral Masking and Interpolation Attack (SMIA), a novel method
that strategically manipulates inaudible frequency regions of AI-generated
audio. By altering the voice in imperceptible zones to the human ear, SMIA
creates adversarial samples that sound authentic while deceiving CMs. We
conducted a comprehensive evaluation of our attack against state-of-the-art
(SOTA) models across multiple tasks, under simulated real-world conditions.
SMIA achieved a strong attack success rate (ASR) of at least 82% against
combined VAS/CM systems, at least 97.5% against standalone speaker verification
systems, and 100% against countermeasures. These findings conclusively
demonstrate that current security postures are insufficient against adaptive
adversarial attacks. This work highlights the urgent need for a paradigm shift
toward next-generation defenses that employ dynamic, context-aware frameworks
capable of evolving with the threat landscape.

Result: 该方法具有通用性，可应用于不同的探测器设计和缺陷类型

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效应对标签稀缺问题，为物理实验中的多元时间序列异常检测提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is crucial to ensure the
quality of data coming from a physics experiment. Accurately identifying the
moments when unexpected errors or defects occur is essential, yet challenging
due to scarce labels, unknown anomaly types, and complex correlations across
dimensions. To address the scarcity and unreliability of labelled data, we use
the Lorenzetti Simulator to generate synthetic events with injected calorimeter
anomalies. We then assess the sensitivity of several time series anomaly
detection methods, including transformer-based and other deep learning models.
The approach employed here is generic and applicable to different detector
designs and defects.

TL;DR: RINO是一种自监督学习方法，通过直接在碰撞数据上预训练模型，学习对重正化群流尺度不变的嵌入表示，以解决高能物理中模拟数据与真实数据之间的域偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高能物理中监督学习依赖模拟数据生成标签，但模拟数据往往无法准确建模真实碰撞或探测器响应，导致域偏移问题。

Method: 提出RINO方法，在JetClass数据集（模拟真实QCD主导实验数据）上预训练基于transformer的模型，学习重正化群流尺度不变的嵌入，然后在JetNet数据集（模拟仿真数据）上进行微调，用于识别顶夸克衰变产生的喷注。

Result: RINO在从JetNet训练数据到JetClass数据的泛化能力方面优于从零开始的JetNet监督训练，显示出更好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RINO通过在真实碰撞数据上预训练，然后在小规模高质量MC数据集上微调，有潜力提高高能物理中机器学习模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: A common challenge with supervised machine learning (ML) in high energy
physics (HEP) is the reliance on simulations for labeled data, which can often
mismodel the underlying collision or detector response. To help mitigate this
problem of domain shift, we propose RINO (Renormalization Group Invariance with
No Labels), a self-supervised learning approach that can instead pretrain
models directly on collision data, learning embeddings invariant to
renormalization group flow scales. In this work, we pretrain a
transformer-based model on jets originating from quantum chromodynamic (QCD)
interactions from the JetClass dataset, emulating real QCD-dominated
experimental data, and then finetune on the JetNet dataset -- emulating
simulations -- for the task of identifying jets originating from top quark
decays. RINO demonstrates improved generalization from the JetNet training data
to JetClass data compared to supervised training on JetNet from scratch,
demonstrating the potential for RINO pretraining on real collision data
followed by fine-tuning on small, high-quality MC datasets, to improve the
robustness of ML models in HEP.

Motivation: 探讨社会福祉应如何优先排序，以及人们在公平与个人福祉之间愿意做出何种权衡，研究社会福祉分配中的公平偏好问题。

Method: 使用英国全国代表性样本（n=300）进行陈述偏好实验，在不确定性条件下评估自己和他人的生活满意度结果，采用期望效用最大化（EUM）框架估计个体效用函数，并测试对累积前景理论（CPT）中小概率超重敏感度。

Result: 大多数参与者显示凹形（风险规避）效用曲线，对社会生活满意度结果的不平等比个人风险表现出更强的规避态度，这些偏好与政治立场无关。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了使用平均生活满意度作为政策指标的做法，支持开发更能准确反映集体人类价值的非线性基于效用的替代方案，对公共政策、福祉测量和价值对齐AI系统设计具有重要意义。

Abstract: How should well-being be prioritised in society, and what trade-offs are
people willing to make between fairness and personal well-being? We investigate
these questions using a stated preference experiment with a nationally
representative UK sample (n = 300), in which participants evaluated life
satisfaction outcomes for both themselves and others under conditions of
uncertainty. Individual-level utility functions were estimated using an
Expected Utility Maximisation (EUM) framework and tested for sensitivity to the
overweighting of small probabilities, as characterised by Cumulative Prospect
Theory (CPT). A majority of participants displayed concave (risk-averse)
utility curves and showed stronger aversion to inequality in societal life
satisfaction outcomes than to personal risk. These preferences were unrelated
to political alignment, suggesting a shared normative stance on fairness in
well-being that cuts across ideological boundaries. The results challenge use
of average life satisfaction as a policy metric, and support the development of
nonlinear utility-based alternatives that more accurately reflect collective
human values. Implications for public policy, well-being measurement, and the
design of value-aligned AI systems are discussed.

Result: 该方法能显著提高输出精度，在大量查询同一数据时仍能保持所需的隐私水平

Conclusion: sigma-counting方法有效解决了传统隐私保护计数查询的局限性，支持大规模和时变数据集的应用

Abstract: Many data applications involve counting queries, where a client specifies a
feasible range of variables and a database returns the corresponding item
counts. A program that produces the counts of different queries often risks
leaking sensitive individual-level information. A popular approach to enhance
data privacy is to return a noisy version of the actual count. It is typically
achieved by adding independent noise to each query and then control the total
privacy budget within a period. This approach may be limited in the number of
queries and output accuracy in practice. Also, the returned counts do not
maintain the total order for nested queries, an important feature in many
applications. This work presents the design and analysis of a new method,
sigma-counting, that addresses these challenges. Sigma-counting uses the notion
of sigma-algebra to construct privacy-preserving counting queries. We show that
the proposed concepts and methods can significantly improve output accuracy
while maintaining a desired privacy level in the presence of massive queries to
the same data. We also discuss how the technique can be applied to address
large and time-varying datasets.

Abstract: Trustworthy AI requires reasoning systems that are not only powerful but also
transparent and reliable. Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) is central to formal
reasoning, yet classical binary resolution remains limited, as each step
involves only two clauses and eliminates at most two literals. To overcome this
bottleneck, the concept of standard contradiction and the theory of
contradiction-separation-based deduction were introduced in 2018. This paper
advances that framework by focusing on the systematic construction of standard
contradictions. Specially, this study investigates construction methods for two
principal forms of standard contradiction: the maximum triangular standard
contradiction and the triangular-type standard contradiction. Building on these
structures, we propose a procedure for determining the satisfiability and
unsatisfiability of clause sets via maximum standard contradiction.
Furthermore, we derive formulas for computing the number of standard
sub-contradictions embedded within both the maximum triangular standard
contradiction and the triangular-type standard contradiction. The results
presented herein furnish the methodological basis for advancing
contradiction-separation-based dynamic multi-clause automated deduction,
thereby extending the expressive and deductive capabilities of automated
reasoning systems beyond the classical binary paradigm.

Abstract: In response to the prevalent concern of TCP SYN flood attacks within the
context of Software-Defined Internet of Vehicles (SD-IoV), this study addresses
the significant challenge of network security in rapidly evolving vehicular
communication systems. This research focuses on optimizing a Random Forest
Classifier model to achieve maximum accuracy and minimal detection time,
thereby enhancing vehicular network security. The methodology involves
preprocessing a dataset containing SYN attack instances, employing feature
scaling and label encoding techniques, and applying Stratified K-Fold
cross-validation to target key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and
F1-score. This research achieved an average value of 0.999998 for all metrics
with a SYN DoS attack detection time of 0.24 seconds. Results show that the
fine-tuned Random Forest model, configured with 20 estimators and a depth of
10, effectively differentiates between normal and malicious traffic with high
accuracy and minimal detection time, which is crucial for SD-IoV networks. This
approach marks a significant advancement and introduces a state-of-the-art
algorithm in detecting SYN flood attacks, combining high accuracy with minimal
detection time. It contributes to vehicular network security by providing a
robust solution against TCP SYN flood attacks while maintaining network
efficiency and reliability.

Abstract: Blockchain and smart contracts have garnered significant interest in recent
years as the foundation of a decentralized, trustless digital ecosystem,
thereby eliminating the need for traditional centralized authorities. Despite
their central role in powering Web3, their complexity still presents
significant barriers for non-expert users. To bridge this gap, Artificial
Intelligence (AI)-based agents have emerged as valuable tools for interacting
with blockchain environments, supporting a range of tasks, from analyzing
on-chain data and optimizing transaction strategies to detecting
vulnerabilities within smart contracts. While interest in applying AI to
blockchain is growing, the literature still lacks a comprehensive survey that
focuses specifically on the intersection with AI agents. Most of the related
work only provides general considerations, without focusing on any specific
domain. This paper addresses this gap by presenting the first Systematization
of Knowledge dedicated to AI-driven systems for blockchain, with a special
focus on their security and privacy dimensions, shedding light on their
applications, limitations, and future research directions.

Result: 实验显示该方法检测违规所需的样本量比现有方法少几个数量级（从5万减少到几百个样本），并能在一个训练运行内识别DP-SGD隐私违规。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了差分隐私审计的效率和实用性，特别适用于实际场景中的隐私保护验证。

Abstract: We propose a practical sequential test for auditing differential privacy
guarantees of black-box mechanisms. The test processes streams of mechanisms'
outputs providing anytime-valid inference while controlling Type I error,
overcoming the fixed sample size limitation of previous batch auditing methods.
Experiments show this test detects violations with sample sizes that are orders
of magnitude smaller than existing methods, reducing this number from 50K to a
few hundred examples, across diverse realistic mechanisms. Notably, it
identifies DP-SGD privacy violations in \textit{under} one training run, unlike
prior methods needing full model training.

### [235] [Paladin: Defending LLM-enabled Phishing Emails with a New Trigger-Tag Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07287)
*Yan Pang,Wenlong Meng,Xiaojing Liao,Tianhao Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了Paladin方法，通过在普通LLM中嵌入触发-标签关联机制，使模型在生成钓鱼内容时自动插入可检测标签，实现高效钓鱼内容检测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，其被恶意用于生成钓鱼内容的威胁日益严重。现有检测方法难以可靠识别LLM生成的钓鱼邮件，而基于LLM的检测方法计算成本高且受限于底层模型性能

Method: Paladin方法通过多种插入策略将触发-标签关联嵌入到普通LLM中，创建工具化LLM。当生成钓鱼相关内容时，模型会自动包含可检测标签，基于隐式和显式触发与标签设计了四种不同场景

Result: 实验结果表明该方法优于基线方法，在所有场景下检测准确率均超过90%

Conclusion: Paladin方法在隐蔽性、有效性和鲁棒性三个关键维度上表现优异，为解决LLM生成钓鱼内容的检测问题提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models, the potential threat of
their malicious use, particularly in generating phishing content, is becoming
increasingly prevalent. Leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, malicious users
can synthesize phishing emails that are free from spelling mistakes and other
easily detectable features. Furthermore, such models can generate
topic-specific phishing messages, tailoring content to the target domain and
increasing the likelihood of success.
  Detecting such content remains a significant challenge, as LLM-generated
phishing emails often lack clear or distinguishable linguistic features. As a
result, most existing semantic-level detection approaches struggle to identify
them reliably. While certain LLM-based detection methods have shown promise,
they suffer from high computational costs and are constrained by the
performance of the underlying language model, making them impractical for
large-scale deployment.
  In this work, we aim to address this issue. We propose Paladin, which embeds
trigger-tag associations into vanilla LLM using various insertion strategies,
creating them into instrumented LLMs. When an instrumented LLM generates
content related to phishing, it will automatically include detectable tags,
enabling easier identification. Based on the design on implicit and explicit
triggers and tags, we consider four distinct scenarios in our work. We evaluate
our method from three key perspectives: stealthiness, effectiveness, and
robustness, and compare it with existing baseline methods. Experimental results
show that our method outperforms the baselines, achieving over 90% detection
accuracy across all scenarios.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: zkUnlearner是首个支持多粒度和防伪的可验证机器学习遗忘零知识框架，通过位掩码技术实现样本级、特征级和类别级遗忘，并能抵抗梯度伪造攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着'被遗忘权'需求的增长，需要可验证的机器学习遗忘机制来确保透明度和问责制，现有方法在效率和隐私方面存在局限且易受伪造攻击。

Method: 提出基于位掩码技术的通用计算模型，支持选择性零知识训练证明，可转换为算术电路兼容多种零知识证明系统，并设计有效策略抵抗最先进的伪造攻击。

Result: 实现了首个支持多粒度遗忘的零知识框架，能够有效抵抗梯度伪造攻击，并通过zkSNARK实例化验证了其实用性。

Conclusion: zkUnlearner为可验证机器学习遗忘提供了有效的解决方案，在支持多粒度遗忘的同时确保了防伪能力，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: As the demand for exercising the "right to be forgotten" grows, the need for
verifiable machine unlearning has become increasingly evident to ensure both
transparency and accountability. We present {\em zkUnlearner}, the first
zero-knowledge framework for verifiable machine unlearning, specifically
designed to support {\em multi-granularity} and {\em forgery-resistance}.
  First, we propose a general computational model that employs a {\em
bit-masking} technique to enable the {\em selectivity} of existing
zero-knowledge proofs of training for gradient descent algorithms. This
innovation enables not only traditional {\em sample-level} unlearning but also
more advanced {\em feature-level} and {\em class-level} unlearning. Our model
can be translated to arithmetic circuits, ensuring compatibility with a broad
range of zero-knowledge proof systems. Furthermore, our approach overcomes key
limitations of existing methods in both efficiency and privacy. Second, forging
attacks present a serious threat to the reliability of unlearning.
Specifically, in Stochastic Gradient Descent optimization, gradients from
unlearned data, or from minibatches containing it, can be forged using
alternative data samples or minibatches that exclude it. We propose the first
effective strategies to resist state-of-the-art forging attacks. Finally, we
benchmark a zkSNARK-based instantiation of our framework and perform
comprehensive performance evaluations to validate its practicality.

TL;DR: 通过引入MITRE ATT&CK Matrix构建的确定性任务树，提出了一种导向性推理流水线，用于改善LLM渗透测试代理的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM渗透测试代理主要依靠自我导向推理，容易产生不准确或幻觉的步骤，导致无效动作和循环响应。

Method: 设计了一种导向性推理流水线，结合MITRE ATT&CK Matrix构建确定性任务树，限制LLM的推理过程仅在经过验证的战术技术和程序范围内进行。

Result: 在10个HackTheBox安全练习的103个子任务中，新方法在Llama-3-8B、Gemini-1.5和GPT-4上分别完成了71.8%、72.8%和78.6%的任务，而现有方法仅完成了13.5%、16.5%和75.7%，且需要更多的模型查询。

Conclusion: 将确定性任务树集成到LLM推理流程中，可显著提高自动化网络安全评估的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven interest in
automating cybersecurity penetration testing workflows, offering the promise of
faster and more consistent vulnerability assessment for enterprise systems.
Existing LLM agents for penetration testing primarily rely on self-guided
reasoning, which can produce inaccurate or hallucinated procedural steps. As a
result, the LLM agent may undertake unproductive actions, such as exploiting
unused software libraries or generating cyclical responses that repeat prior
tactics. In this work, we propose a guided reasoning pipeline for penetration
testing LLM agents that incorporates a deterministic task tree built from the
MITRE ATT&CK Matrix, a proven penetration testing kll chain, to constrain the
LLM's reaoning process to explicitly defined tactics, techniques, and
procedures. This anchors reasoning in proven penetration testing methodologies
and filters out ineffective actions by guiding the agent towards more
productive attack procedures. To evaluate our approach, we built an automated
penetration testing LLM agent using three LLMs (Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and
GPT-4) and applied it to navigate 10 HackTheBox cybersecurity exercises with
103 discrete subtasks representing real-world cyberattack scenarios. Our
proposed reasoning pipeline guided the LLM agent through 71.8\%, 72.8\%, and
78.6\% of subtasks using Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4, respectively.
Comparatively, the state-of-the-art LLM penetration testing tool using
self-guided reasoning completed only 13.5\%, 16.5\%, and 75.7\% of subtasks and
required 86.2\%, 118.7\%, and 205.9\% more model queries. This suggests that
incorporating a deterministic task tree into LLM reasoning pipelines can
enhance the accuracy and efficiency of automated cybersecurity assessments

TL;DR: 本文提出了ImportSnare攻击框架，针对检索增强代码生成(RACG)系统，通过毒化文档和恶意依赖劫持来攻击LLM代码生成的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代码生成能力的提升，RAG技术虽然能提高代码正确性和安全性，但同时也引入了新的攻击面。作者旨在探索RACG系统中的安全漏洞，特别是恶意依赖劫持问题。

Method: 提出ImportSnare攻击框架，采用两种协同策略：1)位置感知波束搜索优化隐藏排名序列，提升毒化文档在检索结果中的排名；2)多语言归纳建议生成越狱序列，操纵LLM推荐恶意依赖。

Result: 在Python、Rust和JavaScript的广泛实验中，ImportSnare实现了显著攻击成功率（对matplotlib等流行库超过50%），即使在0.01%的低毒化比例下也能成功攻击自定义和真实恶意包。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM驱动开发中的关键供应链风险，突显了代码生成任务安全对齐的不足，为未来研究提供了多语言基准套件和数据集。

Abstract: Code generation has emerged as a pivotal capability of Large Language
Models(LLMs), revolutionizing development efficiency for programmers of all
skill levels. However, the complexity of data structures and algorithmic logic
often results in functional deficiencies and security vulnerabilities in
generated code, reducing it to a prototype requiring extensive manual
debugging. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can enhance correctness
and security by leveraging external code manuals, it simultaneously introduces
new attack surfaces.
  In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of attack surfaces in
Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG), focusing on malicious dependency
hijacking. We demonstrate how poisoned documentation containing hidden
malicious dependencies (e.g., matplotlib_safe) can subvert RACG, exploiting
dual trust chains: LLM reliance on RAG and developers' blind trust in LLM
suggestions. To construct poisoned documents, we propose ImportSnare, a novel
attack framework employing two synergistic strategies: 1)Position-aware beam
search optimizes hidden ranking sequences to elevate poisoned documents in
retrieval results, and 2)Multilingual inductive suggestions generate
jailbreaking sequences to manipulate LLMs into recommending malicious
dependencies. Through extensive experiments across Python, Rust, and
JavaScript, ImportSnare achieves significant attack success rates (over 50% for
popular libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn) in general, and is also able
to succeed even when the poisoning ratio is as low as 0.01%, targeting both
custom and real-world malicious packages. Our findings reveal critical supply
chain risks in LLM-powered development, highlighting inadequate security
alignment for code generation tasks. To support future research, we will
release the multilingual benchmark suite and datasets. The project homepage is

*Christopher Brady,Xu Wu*

Main category: nucl-th

TL;DR: OECD核临界安全工作组提出基准测试，评估核数据调整技术在处理非线性应用和低相关性实验时的性能。本研究引入贝叶斯逆不确定性量化(IUQ)方法，与传统方法GLLS和MOCABA进行比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估当前核数据调整技术在处理非线性应用和与应用程序相关性低的实验时的性能表现，寻找更有效的核数据调整方法。

Method: 采用贝叶斯逆不确定性量化(IUQ)方法，并与传统的广义线性最小二乘法(GLLS)和蒙特卡洛贝叶斯(MOCABA)方法进行对比分析。

Result: 对于线性应用，IUQ的后验预测与GLLS和MOCABA一致；对于非线性应用，GLLS预测无法复现计算响应分布，MOCABA接近一致，而IUQ直接使用计算模型响应。发现低相关性实验对核数据调整具有信息价值。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯IUQ在核数据调整中显示出潜力，特别是在处理非线性应用时表现优于传统方法，为实验选择提供了有用标准。

Abstract: The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Working
Party on Nuclear Criticality Safety (WPNCS) proposed a benchmark exercise to
assess the performance of current nuclear data adjustment techniques applied to
nonlinear applications and experiments with low correlation to applications.
This work introduces Bayesian Inverse Uncertainty Quantification (IUQ) as a
method for nuclear data adjustments in this benchmark, and compares IUQ to the
more traditional methods of Generalized Linear Least Squares (GLLS) and Monte
Carlo Bayes (MOCABA). Posterior predictions from IUQ showed agreement with GLLS
and MOCABA for linear applications. When comparing GLLS, MOCABA, and IUQ
posterior predictions to computed model responses using adjusted parameters, we
observe that GLLS predictions fail to replicate computed response distributions
for nonlinear applications, while MOCABA shows near agreement, and IUQ uses
computed model responses directly. We also discuss observations on why
experiments with low correlation to applications can be informative to nuclear
data adjustments and identify some properties useful in selecting experiments
for inclusion in nuclear data adjustment. Performance in this benchmark
indicates potential for Bayesian IUQ in nuclear data adjustments.

### [240] [Beyond Sequential Reranking: Reranker-Guided Search Improves Reasoning Intensive Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07163)
*Haike Xu,Tong Chen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Reranker-Guided-Search (RGS) 是一种新颖的检索方法，通过直接根据重排序器偏好检索文档来突破传统检索-重排序管道的限制，在有限的100文档重排序预算下显著提升了多个基准的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索-重排序管道存在两个关键限制：受限于初始检索的top-k文档质量，以及LLM重排序器计算需求增长限制了可处理文档数量。

Method: 使用近似最近邻算法生成的邻近图进行贪婪搜索，基于文档相似性策略性地优先选择有前景的文档进行重排序，直接根据重排序器偏好检索文档。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得显著性能提升：BRIGHT提升3.5分，FollowIR提升2.9分，M-BEIR提升5.1分，均在100文档的重排序预算约束下实现。

Conclusion: 在固定的嵌入和重排序器模型对下，策略性地选择重排序文档可以在有限的重排序预算下显著提高检索准确性。

Abstract: The widely used retrieve-and-rerank pipeline faces two critical limitations:
they are constrained by the initial retrieval quality of the top-k documents,
and the growing computational demands of LLM-based rerankers restrict the
number of documents that can be effectively processed. We introduce
Reranker-Guided-Search (RGS), a novel approach that bypasses these limitations
by directly retrieving documents according to reranker preferences rather than
following the traditional sequential reranking method. Our method uses a greedy
search on proximity graphs generated by approximate nearest neighbor
algorithms, strategically prioritizing promising documents for reranking based
on document similarity. Experimental results demonstrate substantial
performance improvements across multiple benchmarks: 3.5 points on BRIGHT, 2.9
on FollowIR, and 5.1 on M-BEIR, all within a constrained reranker budget of 100
documents. Our analysis suggests that, given a fixed pair of embedding and
reranker models, strategically selecting documents to rerank can significantly
improve retrieval accuracy under limited reranker budget.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 这篇论文构建了一个多样化的复杂检索任务集合，用于评测现有检索模型在复杂查询下的性能，发现即使最好的模型也表现差强


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，人们对检索系统的期望持续提升，需要处理更复杂的多部分、约束条件或要求的自然语言查询。但现有评测资源在复杂检索任务方面存在空白，限制了检索模型能力的评估和进步

Method: 构建了一个多样化且实际的复杂检索任务集合，对代表性的现有最优检索模型进行基准测试，并探索了基于LLM的查询扩展和重写技术对检索质量的影响

Result: 实验结果显示，即使最好的检索模型在复杂任务上也表现差强，平均nDCG@10仅为0.346，R@100仅为0.587。LLM增强技术虽然能够帮助较弱的模型，但对最强模型的性能反而有所下降

Conclusion: 复杂检索任务对现有检索模型构成了重大挑战，需要发展下一代更强大的检索模型。这项研究为评估和推动检索模型在复杂任务上的进步提供了重要的基准资源

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are incredible and versatile tools for
text-based tasks that have enabled countless, previously unimaginable,
applications. Retrieval models, in contrast, have not yet seen such capable
general-purpose models emerge. To achieve this goal, retrieval models must be
able to perform complex retrieval tasks, where queries contain multiple parts,
constraints, or requirements in natural language. These tasks represent a
natural progression from the simple, single-aspect queries that are used in the
vast majority of existing, commonly used evaluation sets. Complex queries
naturally arise as people expect search systems to handle more specific and
often ambitious information requests, as is demonstrated by how people use
LLM-based information systems. Despite the growing desire for retrieval models
to expand their capabilities in complex retrieval tasks, there exist limited
resources to assess the ability of retrieval models on a comprehensive set of
diverse complex tasks. The few resources that do exist feature a limited scope
and often lack realistic settings making it hard to know the true capabilities
of retrieval models on complex real-world retrieval tasks. To address this
shortcoming and spur innovation in next-generation retrieval models, we
construct a diverse and realistic set of complex retrieval tasks and benchmark
a representative set of state-of-the-art retrieval models. Additionally, we
explore the impact of LLM-based query expansion and rewriting on retrieval
quality. Our results show that even the best models struggle to produce
high-quality retrieval results with the highest average nDCG@10 of only 0.346
and R@100 of only 0.587 across all tasks. Although LLM augmentation can help
weaker models, the strongest model has decreased performance across all metrics
with all rewriting techniques.

TL;DR: 论文提出了两个包含敏感度标签的新数据集，用于评估个性化AI系统的潜在危害，而不仅仅是参与度指标


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化AI系统（如推荐系统和聊天机器人）可能向用户暴露敏感或有害内容，影响用户福祉，需要定量评估工具

Method: 创建了两个数据集：一个整合MovieLens评分数据和Does the Dog Die?网站的内容警告，另一个结合Archive of Our Own的同人小说互动数据和用户生成的警告

Result: 开发了包含敏感度分类标签和用户内容评级的两个新颖数据集

Conclusion: 这些数据集为研究人员提供了评估个性化系统潜在负面影响的重要工具，超越了传统的参与度指标

Abstract: Personalized AI systems, from recommendation systems to chatbots, are a
prevalent method for distributing content to users based on their learned
preferences. However, there is growing concern about the adverse effects of
these systems, including their potential tendency to expose users to sensitive
or harmful material, negatively impacting overall well-being. To address this
concern quantitatively, it is necessary to create datasets with relevant
sensitivity labels for content, enabling researchers to evaluate personalized
systems beyond mere engagement metrics. To this end, we introduce two novel
datasets that include a taxonomy of sensitivity labels alongside user-content
ratings: one that integrates MovieLens rating data with content warnings from
the Does the Dog Die? community ratings website, and another that combines
fan-fiction interaction data and user-generated warnings from Archive of Our
Own.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM推荐系统中的过度个性化问题，即算法导致的过滤氛境(PIEs)限制了内容多样性。避免重新训练模型或依赖不透明的经验法则。

Method: 重新结构用户个性化知识图(PKG)，压制特征共现模式。提出三种符号适应策略：软重新权重、硬反转和偏见三元组目标删除。使用客户端学习算法优化适应策略。通过结构化提示引导语言模型产生更多样的推荐。

Result: 在菜谱推荐平台上的实验显示，个性化PKG适应显著提高了内容新颖性，同时保持了推荐质量。效果超过全局适应和简单提示方法。

Conclusion: 该轻量级框架通过动态适应用户知识图，有效减少LLM推荐系统中的过度个性化问题，在保持相关性的同时提高内容多样性。

Abstract: We present a lightweight neuro-symbolic framework to mitigate
over-personalization in LLM-based recommender systems by adapting user-side
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) at inference time. Instead of retraining models or
relying on opaque heuristics, our method restructures a user's Personalized
Knowledge Graph (PKG) to suppress feature co-occurrence patterns that reinforce
Personalized Information Environments (PIEs), i.e., algorithmically induced
filter bubbles that constrain content diversity. These adapted PKGs are used to
construct structured prompts that steer the language model toward more diverse,
Out-PIE recommendations while preserving topical relevance. We introduce a
family of symbolic adaptation strategies, including soft reweighting, hard
inversion, and targeted removal of biased triples, and a client-side learning
algorithm that optimizes their application per user. Experiments on a recipe
recommendation benchmark show that personalized PKG adaptations significantly
increase content novelty while maintaining recommendation quality,
outperforming global adaptation and naive prompt-based methods.

Motivation: 传统神经协同过滤模型在静态设置下训练，无法适应动态环境中用户偏好的演化。现有增量学习方法在推荐任务中面临数据稀疏性和任务范式差异的挑战

Method: 提出MEGG框架，引入GGscore指标量化样本影响力，选择性回放高影响力样本。该方法是模型无关的，可无缝集成到各种架构中

Result: 在三个神经模型和四个基准数据集上的实验显示，MEGG优于最先进的基线方法，具有强可扩展性、高效性和鲁棒性

Conclusion: MEGG为解决推荐系统中的增量学习问题提供了有效的解决方案，能够很好地缓解灾难性遗忘，适用于动态推荐环境

Abstract: Neural Collaborative Filtering models are widely used in recommender systems
but are typically trained under static settings, assuming fixed data
distributions. This limits their applicability in dynamic environments where
user preferences evolve. Incremental learning offers a promising solution, yet
conventional methods from computer vision or NLP face challenges in
recommendation tasks due to data sparsity and distinct task paradigms. Existing
approaches for neural recommenders remain limited and often lack
generalizability. To address this, we propose MEGG, Replay Samples with
Maximally Extreme GGscore, an experience replay based incremental learning
framework. MEGG introduces GGscore, a novel metric that quantifies sample
influence, enabling the selective replay of highly influential samples to
mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Being model-agnostic, MEGG integrates
seamlessly across architectures and frameworks. Experiments on three neural
models and four benchmark datasets show superior performance over
state-of-the-art baselines, with strong scalability, efficiency, and
robustness. Implementation will be released publicly upon acceptance.

TL;DR: FLeW方法通过统一对比学习、细粒度表示学习和任务感知学习三种方法，利用引用意图和频率增强训练信号，实现领域泛化的多面表示，无需任务特定微调即可生成任务感知的文档嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前科学文档表示学习方法存在三个问题：1)对比学习未充分利用引用信息且生成单向量表示；2)细粒度表示需要昂贵集成且缺乏领域泛化；3)任务感知学习依赖预定义任务分类，忽略细微任务差异。

Method: 提出FLeW方法：1)基于引用意图和频率的三元组采样增强引用结构信号；2)对齐科学写作结构的引用意图实现领域泛化的面划分；3)通过简单权重搜索自适应集成三个面级嵌入为任务特定文档嵌入。

Result: 实验表明FLeW在多个科学任务和领域中相比先前模型具有更好的适用性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FLeW成功统一了三种表示学习方法，通过引用意图驱动的面划分和自适应集成，实现了无需任务特定微调的高效科学文档表示学习。

Abstract: Scientific document representation learning provides powerful embeddings for
various tasks, while current methods face challenges across three approaches.
1) Contrastive training with citation-structural signals underutilizes citation
information and still generates single-vector representations. 2) Fine-grained
representation learning, which generates multiple vectors at the sentence or
aspect level, requires costly integration and lacks domain generalization. 3)
Task-aware learning depends on manually predefined task categorization,
overlooking nuanced task distinctions and requiring extra training data for
task-specific modules. To address these problems, we propose a new method that
unifies the three approaches for better representations, namely FLeW.
Specifically, we introduce a novel triplet sampling method that leverages
citation intent and frequency to enhance citation-structural signals for
training. Citation intents (background, method, result), aligned with the
general structure of scientific writing, facilitate a domain-generalized facet
partition for fine-grained representation learning. Then, we adopt a simple
weight search to adaptively integrate three facet-level embeddings into a
task-specific document embedding without task-aware fine-tuning. Experiments
show the applicability and robustness of FLeW across multiple scientific tasks
and fields, compared to prior models.

Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法主要在欧几里得空间操作，限制了捕捉非线性依赖和几何结构的能力。

Method: 通过核化VICReg损失函数中的方差、不变性和协方差项，在再生核希尔伯特空间中使用双中心核矩阵和希尔伯特-施密特范数进行非线性特征学习。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10、STL-10、TinyImageNet和ImageNet100等数据集上均取得一致性能提升，特别是在非线性结构明显的数据集上改进显著。可视化显示核化嵌入具有更好的等距性和类别分离。

Conclusion: 核化自监督学习目标是连接经典核方法和现代表示学习的有前景方向。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
representation learning by optimizing geometric objectives--such as invariance
to augmentations, variance preservation, and feature decorrelation--without
requiring labels. However, most existing methods operate in Euclidean space,
limiting their ability to capture nonlinear dependencies and geometric
structures. In this work, we propose Kernel VICReg, a novel self-supervised
learning framework that lifts the VICReg objective into a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS). By kernelizing each term of the loss-variance,
invariance, and covariance--we obtain a general formulation that operates on
double-centered kernel matrices and Hilbert-Schmidt norms, enabling nonlinear
feature learning without explicit mappings.
  We demonstrate that Kernel VICReg not only avoids representational collapse
but also improves performance on tasks with complex or small-scale data.
Empirical evaluations across MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, TinyImageNet, and
ImageNet100 show consistent gains over Euclidean VICReg, with particularly
strong improvements on datasets where nonlinear structures are prominent. UMAP
visualizations further confirm that kernel-based embeddings exhibit better
isometry and class separation. Our results suggest that kernelizing SSL
objectives is a promising direction for bridging classical kernel methods with
modern representation learning.

Analysis Mixtures (ADHAM), an interpretable additive survival model. ADHAM
assumes a conditional latent structure that defines subgroups, each
characterized by a combination of covariate-specific hazard functions. To
select the number of subgroups, we introduce a post-training refinement that
reduces the number of equivalent latent subgroups by merging similar groups. We
perform comprehensive studies to demonstrate ADHAM's interpretability at the
population, subgroup, and individual levels. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets show that ADHAM provides novel insights into the
association between exposures and outcomes. Further, ADHAM remains on par with
existing state-of-the-art survival baselines in terms of predictive
performance, offering a scalable and interpretable approach to time-to-event
prediction in healthcare.

*Yuqi Zhou,Zhanhong Cheng,Lingqian Hu,Yuheng Bu,Shenhao Wang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本研究提出了NestGNN模型，通过替代图表示旅行方式选择关系，将经典嵌套logit模型推广到神经网络框架中，在保持两层替代模式的同时显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统嵌套logit模型表示能力有限且依赖手工设计的效用函数，现有深度神经网络无法显式捕捉离散选择中的替代品相关性。

Method: 提出替代图概念表示旅行方式替代品关系，设计嵌套效用图神经网络(NestGNN)作为经典NL模型在神经网络家族中的推广。

Result: NestGNN显著优于基准模型，特别是比相应NL模型提升9.2%，同时保持了NL模型的两层替代模式，并在模型设计上更具灵活性。

Conclusion: NestGNN在预测、解释和灵活性方面都表现出强大能力，成功推广了经典NL模型用于旅行方式选择分析。

Abstract: Nested logit (NL) has been commonly used for discrete choice analysis,
including a wide range of applications such as travel mode choice, automobile
ownership, or location decisions. However, the classical NL models are
restricted by their limited representation capability and handcrafted utility
specification. While researchers introduced deep neural networks (DNNs) to
tackle such challenges, the existing DNNs cannot explicitly capture
inter-alternative correlations in the discrete choice context. To address the
challenges, this study proposes a novel concept - alternative graph - to
represent the relationships among travel mode alternatives. Using a nested
alternative graph, this study further designs a nested-utility graph neural
network (NestGNN) as a generalization of the classical NL model in the neural
network family. Theoretically, NestGNNs generalize the classical NL models and
existing DNNs in terms of model representation, while retaining the crucial
two-layer substitution patterns of the NL models: proportional substitution
within a nest but non-proportional substitution beyond a nest. Empirically, we
find that the NestGNNs significantly outperform the benchmark models,
particularly the corresponding NL models by 9.2\%. As shown by elasticity
tables and substitution visualization, NestGNNs retain the two-layer
substitution patterns as the NL model, and yet presents more flexibility in its
model design space. Overall, our study demonstrates the power of NestGNN in
prediction, interpretation, and its flexibility of generalizing the classical
NL model for analyzing travel mode choice.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 改进LASSO PCR模型，通过给主成分指数添加正则化处罚和提出JSRL混合方法，在脑力图分析中显著提升了分类性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LASSO PCR模型假设所有主成分都包含相同信息，但实际任务相关信号可能集中在特定成分中，导致次优组件选择

Method: 修改LASSO PCR为主成分指数添加正则化处罚，提出JSRL混合方法，结合组件级和像素级活动并应用排序稀疏性

Result: 在风险取向、财务激励和情绪调节任务中，方法显著提升分类性能，JSRL跨验证偏差R²提升51.7%，AUC提升7.3%，且预测权重分配与脑区功能一致

Conclusion: 稀疏排序模型为MVPA提供了更健壮的替代方案，在保持解释性的同时显著提高了预测性能

Abstract: Recent advances in neuroimaging analysis have enabled accurate decoding of
mental state from brain activation patterns during functional magnetic
resonance imaging scans. A commonly applied tool for this purpose is principal
components regression regularized with the least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator (LASSO PCR), a type of multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA).
This model presumes that all components are equally likely to harbor relevant
information, when in fact the task-related signal may be concentrated in
specific components. In such cases, the model will fail to select the optimal
set of principal components that maximizes the total signal relevant to the
cognitive process under study. Here, we present modifications to LASSO PCR that
allow for a regularization penalty tied directly to the index of the principal
component, reflecting a prior belief that task-relevant signal is more likely
to be concentrated in components explaining greater variance. Additionally, we
propose a novel hybrid method, Joint Sparsity-Ranked LASSO (JSRL), which
integrates component-level and voxel-level activity under an information parity
framework and imposes ranked sparsity to guide component selection. We apply
the models to brain activation during risk taking, monetary incentive, and
emotion regulation tasks. Results demonstrate that incorporating sparsity
ranking into LASSO PCR produces models with enhanced classification
performance, with JSRL achieving up to 51.7\% improvement in cross-validated
deviance $R^2$ and 7.3\% improvement in cross-validated AUC. Furthermore,
sparsity-ranked models perform as well as or better than standard LASSO PCR
approaches across all classification tasks and allocate predictive weight to
brain regions consistent with their established functional roles, offering a
robust alternative for MVPA.

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于gossip算法的分布式鲁棒统计方法，用于计算L-统计量和秩统计量，并应用于Wilcoxon秩和检验，提供了收敛性保证和实验验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着去中心化AI和边缘智能的发展，传统分布式算法对数据污染脆弱，需要更鲁棒的统计方法来应对对抗性数据。

Method: 开发gossip算法计算秩基统计量（L-统计量和秩统计量），应用于分布式两样本假设检验，特别是Wilcoxon秩和检验。

Result: 提供了严格的收敛性保证，包括首个异步gossip秩估计的收敛率边界，并通过多样化网络拓扑实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 该方法为分布式环境提供了有效的鲁棒统计解决方案，能够抵抗异常值干扰，具有重要的理论和实践价值。

Abstract: As decentralized AI and edge intelligence become increasingly prevalent,
ensuring robustness and trustworthiness in such distributed settings has become
a critical issue-especially in the presence of corrupted or adversarial data.
Traditional decentralized algorithms are vulnerable to data contamination as
they typically rely on simple statistics (e.g., means or sum), motivating the
need for more robust statistics. In line with recent work on decentralized
estimation of trimmed means and ranks, we develop gossip algorithms for
computing a broad class of rank-based statistics, including L-statistics and
rank statistics-both known for their robustness to outliers. We apply our
method to perform robust distributed two-sample hypothesis testing, introducing
the first gossip algorithm for Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. We provide rigorous
convergence guarantees, including the first convergence rate bound for
asynchronous gossip-based rank estimation. We empirically validate our
theoretical results through experiments on diverse network topologies.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SVGauge是第一个面向文本到SVG生成的人类对齐参考指标，通过联合评估视觉保真度和语义一致性，在SVG评估中达到了最高的人类判断相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像评估指标（如FID、LPIPS、CLIPScore）无法满足SVG图像的符号性和矢量性特征，需要专门针对SVG的评估标准。

Method: SVGauge联合测量：(1)视觉保真度：通过提取SigLIP图像嵌入，使用PCA和白化进行域对齐；(2)语义一致性：通过比较BLIP-2生成的SVG描述与原始提示在SBERT和TF-IDF组合空间中的相似性。

Result: 在SHE基准测试中，SVGauge获得了与人类判断的最高相关性，并比现有指标更准确地复现了8个零样本LLM生成器的系统级排名。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了矢量特定评估的必要性，并为未来文本到SVG生成模型的基准测试提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Generated Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) images demand evaluation criteria
tuned to their symbolic and vectorial nature: criteria that existing metrics
such as FID, LPIPS, or CLIPScore fail to satisfy. In this paper, we introduce
SVGauge, the first human-aligned, reference based metric for text-to-SVG
generation. SVGauge jointly measures (i) visual fidelity, obtained by
extracting SigLIP image embeddings and refining them with PCA and whitening for
domain alignment, and (ii) semantic consistency, captured by comparing
BLIP-2-generated captions of the SVGs against the original prompts in the
combined space of SBERT and TF-IDF. Evaluation on the proposed SHE benchmark
shows that SVGauge attains the highest correlation with human judgments and
reproduces system-level rankings of eight zero-shot LLM-based generators more
faithfully than existing metrics. Our results highlight the necessity of
vector-specific evaluation and provide a practical tool for benchmarking future
text-to-SVG generation models.

Motivation: 现有神经辐射方法主要依赖位置特征编码，在模拟高频、强视角依赖的辐射分布时显示出显著局限性

Method: 提出反射感知的光线锥编码方法，使用预筛波的多分辨率哈希网格来准确近似高光泽BSDF等盛，通过连续空间聚合将视角依赖的反射特性嵌入编码过程

Result: 方法显著提升了网络模拟高频反射分布的能力，能够处理从高光泽到低光泽的各种表面细胆程度，同时减轻了网络拟合复杂辐射分布的负担

Conclusion: 综合实验结果表明，该方法在各种光泽条件下都能连续生成高质量、无噪声的实时渲染结果，与基准方法相比具有更高的保真度和现实感

Abstract: Modeling of high-frequency outgoing radiance distributions has long been a
key challenge in rendering, particularly for glossy material. Such
distributions concentrate radiative energy within a narrow lobe and are highly
sensitive to changes in view direction. However, existing neural radiosity
methods, which primarily rely on positional feature encoding, exhibit notable
limitations in capturing these high-frequency, strongly view-dependent radiance
distributions. To address this, we propose a highly-efficient approach by
reflectance-aware ray cone encoding based on the neural radiosity framework,
named neural cone radiosity. The core idea is to employ a pre-filtered
multi-resolution hash grid to accurately approximate the glossy BSDF lobe,
embedding view-dependent reflectance characteristics directly into the encoding
process through continuous spatial aggregation. Our design not only
significantly improves the network's ability to model high-frequency reflection
distributions but also effectively handles surfaces with a wide range of
glossiness levels, from highly glossy to low-gloss finishes. Meanwhile, our
method reduces the network's burden in fitting complex radiance distributions,
allowing the overall architecture to remain compact and efficient.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently
produces high-quality, noise-free renderings in real time under various
glossiness conditions, and delivers superior fidelity and realism compared to
baseline approaches.

Abstract: Text generating capabilities have undergone a substantial transformation with
the introduction of large language models (LLMs). Electroencephalography
(EEG)-based text production is still difficult, though, because it requires a
lot of data and processing power. This paper introduces a new method that
combines the use of the Gemma 2B LLM with a classifier-LLM architecture to
incorporate a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) encoder. Our approach drastically
lowers the amount of data and compute power needed while achieving performance
close to that of cutting-edge methods. Notably, compared to current
methodologies, our methodology delivers an overall performance improvement of
10%. The suggested architecture demonstrates the possibility of effective
transfer learning for EEG-based text production, remaining strong and
functional even in the face of data limits. This work highlights the potential
of integrating LLMs with EEG decoding to improve assistive technologies and
improve independence and communication for those with severe motor limitations.
Our method pushes the limits of present capabilities and opens new paths for
research and application in brain-computer interfaces by efficiently using the
strengths of pre-trained language models. This makes EEG-based text production
more accessible and efficient.

Method: 基于Transformer架构开发生成模型，训练于Bern模型数据，能够以很小的计算成本生成大量合成行星系统

Result: 生成的行星系统与Bern模型直接计算的系统特性非常相似，并能够基于已观测行星预测未观测行星的性质

Conclusion: Transformer基础的生成模型能够高效地抓取行星系统的相关性，为行星发现和研究提供了一种计算效率更高的方法

Abstract: Numerical calculations of planetary system formation are very demanding in
terms of computing power. These synthetic planetary systems can however provide
access to correlations, as predicted in a given numerical framework, between
the properties of planets in the same system. Such correlations can, in return,
be used in order to guide and prioritize observational campaigns aiming at
discovering some types of planets, as Earth-like planets. Our goal is to
develop a generative model which is capable of capturing correlations and
statistical relationships between planets in the same system. Such a model,
trained on the Bern model, offers the possibility to generate large number of
synthetic planetary systems with little computational cost, that can be used,
for example, to guide observational campaigns. Our generative model is based on
the transformer architecture which is well-known to efficiently capture
correlations in sequences and is at the basis of all modern Large Language
Models. To assess the validity of the generative model, we perform visual and
statistical comparisons, as well as a machine learning driven tests. Finally,
as a use case example, we consider the TOI-469 system, in which we aim at
predicting the possible properties of planets c and d, based on the properties
of planet b (the first that has been detected). We show using different
comparison methods that the properties of systems generated by our model are
very similar to the ones of the systems computed directly by the Bern model. We
also show in the case of the TOI-469 system, that using the generative model
allows to predict the properties of planets not yet observed, based on the
properties of the already observed planet. We provide our model to the
community on our website www.ai4exoplanets.com.

Abstract: Advances in neural network design and the availability of large-scale labeled
datasets have driven major improvements in piano transcription. Existing
approaches target either offline applications, with no restrictions on
computational demands, or online transcription, with delays of 128-320 ms.
However, most real-time musical applications require latencies below 30 ms. In
this work, we investigate whether and how the current state-of-the-art online
transcription model can be adapted for real-time piano transcription.
Specifically, we eliminate all non-causal processing, and reduce computational
load through shared computations across core model components and variations in
model size. Additionally, we explore different pre- and postprocessing
strategies, and related label encoding schemes, and discuss their suitability
for real-time transcription. Evaluating the adaptions on the MAESTRO dataset,
we find a drop in transcription accuracy due to strictly causal processing as
well as a tradeoff between the preprocessing latency and prediction accuracy.
We release our system as a baseline to support researchers in designing models
towards minimum latency real-time transcription.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模和复杂度的快速增长，需要更复杂的并行训练方法（如3D并行），这促使向更简单、更易调试的SPMD编程范式转变。但SPMD在即时执行中存在两个关键挑战：确保与单设备执行结果一致性和实现大规模高性能训练。

Method: veScale引入了与任意分片算子兼容的分布式随机数生成(RNG)新算法来解决结果不一致问题，同时通过减少PyTorch原语开销和提升通信效率来显著提升训练性能。

Result: 评估显示veScale相比最先进的训练系统（如TorchTitan）实现了最高2.2倍的加速，代码复杂度降低了78.4%，同时保持了与单设备等效的结果。

Conclusion: veScale成功实现了SPMD范式在分布式张量编程中的民主化，解决了现有系统在结果一致性和性能方面的关键问题，为大规模LLM训练提供了更简单高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have scaled rapidly in size and complexity,
requiring increasingly intricate parallelism for distributed training, such as
3D parallelism. This sophistication motivates a shift toward simpler, more
debuggable programming paradigm like Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD).
However, SPMD in eager execution introduces two key challenges: ensuring
consistency with single-device execution and achieving high performance at
scale. In this paper, we introduce veScale, an eager-mode training system that
fully embraces SPMD paradigm to democratize distributed tensor programming.
veScale addresses the prevalent issue of inconsistent results in systems like
PyTorch by introducing a novel algorithm of distributed Random Number
Generation (RNG) compatible with arbitrary sharded operators. veScale also
significantly boosts training performance by reducing PyTorch primitive's
overhead and improving communication efficiency. Evaluations show that veScale
delivers up to 2.2x speedup over the state-of-the-art training systems, like
TorchTitan, and cuts code complexity by 78.4%, while preserving
single-device-equivalent results.

Conclusion: SSL驱动的表征学习能够改善冰晶特征化并约束其在气候系统中的作用

Abstract: Ice-containing clouds strongly impact climate, but they are hard to model due
to ice crystal habit (i.e., shape) diversity. We use self-supervised learning
(SSL) to learn latent representations of crystals from ice crystal imagery. By
pre-training a vision transformer with many cloud particle images, we learn
robust representations of crystal morphology, which can be used for various
science-driven tasks. Our key contributions include (1) validating that our SSL
approach can be used to learn meaningful representations, and (2) presenting a
relevant application where we quantify ice crystal diversity with these latent
representations. Our results demonstrate the power of SSL-driven
representations to improve the characterization of ice crystals and
subsequently constrain their role in Earth's climate system.

Abstract: We present a budget pacing feature called Smart Fast Finish (SFF). SFF builds
upon the industry standard Fast Finish (FF) feature in budget pacing systems
that depletes remaining advertising budget as quickly as possible towards the
end of some fixed time period. SFF dynamically updates system parameters such
as start time and throttle rate depending on historical ad-campaign data. SFF
is currently in use at DoorDash, one of the largest delivery platforms in the
US, and is part of its budget pacing system. We show via online budget-split
experimentation data and offline simulations that SFF is a robust solution for
overdelivery mitigation when pacing budget.

Abstract: High-quality, medically validated labels exist for clinical actigraphy data
but not for ubiquitous consumer wearables like the Apple Watch. Manually
labeling wearables data is expensive and doesn't scale. This paper offers a
novel framework that transfers valuable labels from a source domain (e.g.,
actigraphy) to a target domain (e.g., Apple Watch) without requiring paired
data. Instead of working with raw time-series signals, we project both domains
into a shared latent embedding space using time-series foundation models
(TSFMs) and develop a new framework to align the cross-device representations.
Our method, Adversarial Alignment of TSFM Embeddings forces the distributions
of source and target embeddings to align within this space, facilitating label
transfer across device type.

Motivation: 过去的通信系统多假设远场平面波模型，但在极大天线数组和分布式无人机系统中，通信多在近场区域进行，需要更准确的波形模型来描述通道特性。

Method: 首先汇次对比了平面波模型(PWM)、球面波模型(SWM)和混合波模型(HSPWM)的SNR表达式，确定HSPWM在建模准确性和分析可处理性之间的平衡。基于此提出了球面域正交匹配追踪(SD-OMP)和张量正交匹配追踪(tensor-OMP)两种通道估计算法。

Result: 模拟结果显示，在正规化均方误差(NMSE)性能方面，tensor-OMP算法与SD-OMP相当，但计算复杂度更低且具有更好的扩展性。

Conclusion: 混合波模型(HSPWM)适合分布式近场多无人机通信系统的通道建模，而基于张量处理的tensor-OMP算法在保持估计准确性的同时有效降低了计算复杂度，为6G网络极大天线数组的实际应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Extremely large antenna array (ELAA) is key to enhancing spectral efficiency
in 6G networks. Leveraging the distributed nature of multi-unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) systems enables the formation of distributed ELAA, which often
operate in the near-field region with spatial sparsity, rendering the
conventional far-field plane wave assumption invalid. This paper investigates
channel estimation for distributed near-field multi-UAV communication systems.
We first derive closed-form signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) expressions under the
plane wave model (PWM), spherical wave model (SWM), and a hybrid
spherical-plane wave model (HSPWM), also referred to as the cross-field model,
within a distributed uniform planar array (UPA) scenario. The analysis shows
that HSPWM achieves a good balance between modeling accuracy and analytical
tractability. Based on this, we propose two channel estimation algorithms: the
spherical-domain orthogonal matching pursuit (SD-OMP) and the tensor-OMP. The
SD-OMP generalizes the polar domain to jointly consider elevation, azimuth, and
range. Under the HSPWM, the channel is naturally formulated as a tensor,
enabling the use of tensor-OMP. Simulation results demonstrate that tensor-OMP
achieves normalized mean square error (NMSE) performance comparable to SD-OMP,
while offering reduced computational complexity and improved scalability.

Motivation: ISAC系统作为6G及以后网络的关键技术，需要解决传统优化方法计算复杂度高的问题，深度学习技术能提供高效近优解

Method: 综述性研究方法，首先介绍深度学习架构和ISAC基础知识，然后分类评估最新的DL基于ISAC技术

Conclusion: 深度学习基于ISAC技术具有重要应用价值，能够降低硬件复杂度、缓觡频谱压力、提高能源效率，是未来ISAC系统发展的关键方向

Abstract: This article comprehensively reviews recent developments and research on deep
learning-based (DL-based) techniques for integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) systems. ISAC, which combines sensing and communication functionalities,
is regarded as a key enabler for 6G and beyond networks, as many emerging
applications, such as vehicular networks and industrial robotics, necessitate
both sensing and communication capabilities for effective operation. A unified
platform that provides both functions can reduce hardware complexity, alleviate
frequency spectrum congestion, and improve energy efficiency. However,
integrating these functionalities on the same hardware requires highly
optimized signal processing and system design, introducing significant
computational complexity when relying on conventional iterative or
optimization-based techniques. As an alternative to conventional techniques,
DL-based techniques offer efficient and near-optimal solutions with reduced
computational complexity. Hence, such techniques are well-suited for operating
under limited computational resources and low latency requirements in real-time
systems. DL-based techniques can swiftly and effectively yield near-optimal
solutions for a wide range of sophisticated ISAC-related tasks, including
waveform design, channel estimation, sensing signal processing, data
demodulation, and interference mitigation. Therefore, motivated by these
advantages, recent studies have proposed various DL-based approaches for ISAC
system design. After briefly introducing DL architectures and ISAC
fundamentals, this survey presents a comprehensive and categorized review of
state-of-the-art DL-based techniques for ISAC, highlights their key advantages
and major challenges, and outlines potential directions for future research.

Motivation: 解决智能家居中食品管理效率问题，特别是在高密度库存条件下物品重叠和遮挡导致的检测不可靠问题，减少食物浪费并优化家庭消费

Method: 构建三模块系统：数据预处理、目标检测与管理、基于Web的可视化界面；采用改进的focal loss方法，通过温度缩放进行自适应类别误差校准

Conclusion: 该系统为现代食品管理提供了实用、用户导向的解决方案，通过减少浪费和更明智的消费推动了可持续生活目标的实现

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a crucial role in enabling seamless
connectivity and intelligent home automation, particularly in food management.
By integrating IoT with computer vision, the smart fridge employs an ESP32-CAM
to establish a monitoring subsystem that enhances food management efficiency
through real-time food detection, inventory tracking, and temperature
monitoring. This benefits waste reduction, grocery planning improvement, and
household consumption optimization. In high-density inventory conditions,
capturing partial or layered images complicates object detection, as
overlapping items and occluded views hinder accurate identification and
counting. Besides, varied angles and obscured details in multi-layered setups
reduce algorithm reliability, often resulting in miscounts or
misclassifications. Our proposed system is structured into three core modules:
data pre-processing, object detection and management, and a web-based
visualization. To address the challenge of poor model calibration caused by
overconfident predictions, we implement a variant of focal loss that mitigates
over-confidence and under-confidence in multi-category classification. This
approach incorporates adaptive, class-wise error calibration via temperature
scaling and evaluates the distribution of predicted probabilities across
methods. Our results demonstrate that robust functional calibration
significantly improves detection reliability under varying lighting conditions
and scalability challenges. Further analysis demonstrates a practical,
user-focused approach to modern food management, advancing sustainable living
goals through reduced waste and more informed consumption.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多策略改进瞪羚优化算法(MSIGOA)，通过迭代更新框架、自适应参数调整策略和优势种群重启策略，有效解决了原始算法探索与开发不平衡、种群信息交换不足等问题，在基准测试和工程优化问题中表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对瞪羚优化算法(GOA)存在的探索与开发不平衡、种群内信息交换不足等缺点，需要开发改进算法来提升优化性能。

Method: 提出多策略改进瞪羚优化算法(MSIGOA)，包括：1)基于迭代的更新框架，根据优化过程在开发和探索之间切换；2)两种自适应参数调整策略；3)基于优势种群的重启策略来避免早熟收敛。

Result: 在CEC2017和CEC2022基准测试集上，MSIGOA不差于原始GOA的比例分别为92.2%和83.3%，不差于其他先进算法的比例分别为88.57%和87.5%。工程优化问题进一步验证了算法的扩展性。

Conclusion: MSIGOA通过多种改进策略显著提升了算法的探索和开发能力，在处理复杂问题时具有优越的收敛性和效率，性能优于原始GOA和其他先进算法。

Abstract: Aiming at the shortcomings of the gazelle optimization algorithm, such as the
imbalance between exploration and exploitation and the insufficient information
exchange within the population, this paper proposes a multi-strategy improved
gazelle optimization algorithm (MSIGOA). To address these issues, MSIGOA
proposes an iteration-based updating framework that switches between
exploitation and exploration according to the optimization process, which
effectively enhances the balance between local exploitation and global
exploration in the optimization process and improves the convergence speed. Two
adaptive parameter tuning strategies improve the applicability of the algorithm
and promote a smoother optimization process. The dominant population-based
restart strategy enhances the algorithms ability to escape from local optima
and avoid its premature convergence. These enhancements significantly improve
the exploration and exploitation capabilities of MSIGOA, bringing superior
convergence and efficiency in dealing with complex problems. In this paper, the
parameter sensitivity, strategy effectiveness, convergence and stability of the
proposed method are evaluated on two benchmark test sets including CEC2017 and
CEC2022. Test results and statistical tests show that MSIGOA outperforms basic
GOA and other advanced algorithms. On the CEC2017 and CEC2022 test sets, the
proportion of functions where MSIGOA is not worse than GOA is 92.2% and 83.3%,
respectively, and the proportion of functions where MSIGOA is not worse than
other algorithms is 88.57% and 87.5%, respectively. Finally, the extensibility
of MSIGAO is further verified by several engineering design optimization
problems.

*Luigi Troiano,Francesco Gissi,Vincenzo Benedetto,Genny Tortora*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本文挑战了传统梯度训练中前向-后向对称性的假设，证明只要保持梯度方向，精确的梯度幅度并不必要。实验表明使用更简单或随机的梯度替代品不会损害学习效果，甚至可能提升训练稳定性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统梯度训练要求激活函数可微分且严格单调，限制了激活函数的选择，特别是排除了具有平坦或不可微分区域的函数。本文旨在打破这种对称性限制，扩展激活函数的设计灵活性。

Method: 通过数学分析证明梯度方向比幅度更重要，在MLP、CNN和BNN等基础架构上进行实证实验，使用简单或随机的梯度替代传统梯度，测试包括Heaviside阶跃函数在内的平坦或不可微分激活函数。

Result: 实验证实放松前向-后向对称性并使用替代梯度不会损害学习效果，反而可能提高训练稳定性和效率。不可微分激活函数如Heaviside阶跃函数也能有效训练。

Conclusion: 打破传统的前向-后向对称性约束可以显著扩展激活函数的选择范围，提高计算效率，为神经网络设计提供更大灵活性。更复杂架构的验证是未来研究方向。

Abstract: Gradient-based neural network training traditionally enforces symmetry
between forward and backward propagation, requiring activation functions to be
differentiable (or sub-differentiable) and strictly monotonic in certain
regions to prevent flat gradient areas. This symmetry, linking forward
activations closely to backward gradients, significantly restricts the
selection of activation functions, particularly excluding those with
substantial flat or non-differentiable regions. In this paper, we challenge
this assumption through mathematical analysis, demonstrating that precise
gradient magnitudes derived from activation functions are largely redundant,
provided the gradient direction is preserved. Empirical experiments conducted
on foundational architectures - such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs),
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) -
confirm that relaxing forward-backward symmetry and substituting traditional
gradients with simpler or stochastic alternatives does not impair learning and
may even enhance training stability and efficiency. We explicitly demonstrate
that neural networks with flat or non-differentiable activation functions, such
as the Heaviside step function, can be effectively trained, thereby expanding
design flexibility and computational efficiency. Further empirical validation
with more complex architectures remains a valuable direction for future
research.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks offer a promising path toward energy-efficient,
brain-like associative memory. This paper introduces Word2Spike, a novel rate
coding mechanism that combines continuous word embeddings and neuromorphic
architectures. We develop a one-to-one mapping that converts multi-dimensional
word vectors into spike-based attractor states using Poisson processes. Using
BitNet b1.58 quantization, we maintain 97% semantic similarity of continuous
embeddings on SimLex-999 while achieving 100% reconstruction accuracy on 10,000
words from OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large. We preserve analogy performance
(100% of original embedding performance) even under intentionally introduced
noise, indicating a resilient mechanism for semantic encoding in neuromorphic
systems. Next steps include integrating the mapping with spiking transformers
and liquid state machines (resembling Hopfield Networks) for further
evaluation.

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: TGLF-SINN是一种基于神经网络的替代模型，通过特征工程、物理引导正则化和贝叶斯主动学习，显著减少了训练数据需求，在保持精度的同时实现了45倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TGLF模型虽然能快速预测托卡马克中的湍流输运，但全装置模拟仍计算昂贵。神经网络替代模型需要大量训练数据，限制了在高成本回旋动力学模拟中的应用。

Method: 提出TGLF-SINN方法：1）基于原理的特征工程减少预测范围；2）物理引导的输运谱正则化改善稀疏数据下的泛化能力；3）贝叶斯主动学习策略性选择训练样本

Result: 离线设置下LRMSE降低12.4%；仅用25%数据时LRMSE仅比基线高0.0165；在通量匹配应用中实现45倍加速同时保持相当精度

Conclusion: 该方法为数据获取成本高且稀疏的高保真模型训练高效替代模型提供了可行方案，显著降低了数据需求并保持了准确性

Abstract: The Trapped Gyro-Landau Fluid (TGLF) model provides fast, accurate
predictions of turbulent transport in tokamaks, but whole device simulations
requiring thousands of evaluations remain computationally expensive. Neural
network (NN) surrogates offer accelerated inference with fully differentiable
approximations that enable gradient-based coupling but typically require large
training datasets to capture transport flux variations across plasma
conditions, creating significant training burden and limiting applicability to
expensive gyrokinetic simulations. We propose \textbf{TGLF-SINN
(Spectra-Informed Neural Network)} with three key innovations: (1) principled
feature engineering that reduces target prediction range, simplifying the
learning task; (2) physics-guided regularization of transport spectra to
improve generalization under sparse data; and (3) Bayesian Active Learning
(BAL) to strategically select training samples based on model uncertainty,
reducing data requirements while maintaining accuracy. Our approach achieves
superior performance with significantly less training data. In offline
settings, TGLF-SINN reduces logarithmic root mean squared error (LRMSE) by 12.
4\% compared to the current baseline \base. Using only 25\% of the complete
dataset with BAL, we achieve LRMSE only 0.0165 higher than \base~and 0.0248
higher than our offline model (0.0583). In downstream flux matching
applications, our NN surrogate provides 45x speedup over TGLF while maintaining
comparable accuracy, demonstrating potential for training efficient surrogates
for higher-fidelity models where data acquisition is costly and sparse.

TL;DR: DepthVision是一个多模态场景理解框架，通过GAN从稀疏LiDAR点云合成RGB图像，并结合真实RGB数据，在光线不足条件下提升机器人视觉性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人视觉输入退化或不足时的可靠操作问题，特别是在黑暗或运动模糊等传感器退化情况下。

Method: 使用条件生成对抗网络（GAN）从稀疏LiDAR点云合成RGB图像，通过Luminance-Aware Modality Adaptation（LAMA）动态融合合成图像和真实RGB数据，基于环境光照条件进行自适应混合。

Result: 在真实和模拟数据集上的评估显示，在低光条件下性能显著提升，相比仅使用RGB的基线有实质性改进，同时保持与冻结VLMs的兼容性。

Conclusion: LiDAR引导的RGB合成方法在现实环境中实现鲁棒机器人操作方面具有巨大潜力，无需对下游视觉语言模型进行微调即可补偿传感器退化。

Abstract: Ensuring reliable robot operation when visual input is degraded or
insufficient remains a central challenge in robotics. This letter introduces
DepthVision, a framework for multimodal scene understanding designed to address
this problem. Unlike existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which use only
camera-based visual input alongside language, DepthVision synthesizes RGB
images from sparse LiDAR point clouds using a conditional generative
adversarial network (GAN) with an integrated refiner network. These synthetic
views are then combined with real RGB data using a Luminance-Aware Modality
Adaptation (LAMA), which blends the two types of data dynamically based on
ambient lighting conditions. This approach compensates for sensor degradation,
such as darkness or motion blur, without requiring any fine-tuning of
downstream vision-language models. We evaluate DepthVision on real and
simulated datasets across various models and tasks, with particular attention
to safety-critical tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach improves
performance in low-light conditions, achieving substantial gains over RGB-only
baselines while preserving compatibility with frozen VLMs. This work highlights
the potential of LiDAR-guided RGB synthesis for achieving robust robot
operation in real-world environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了基于SSD-Mamba2的视觉驱动跨模态强化学习框架，用于运动控制，相比传统方法具有更好的计算效率和性能表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的端到端强化学习运动控制器要么是盲控（仅本体感知），要么依赖计算内存权衡不佳的融合骨干网络。循环控制器难以处理长时程信用分配，基于Transformer的融合在token长度上产生二次成本

Method: 使用SSD-Mamba2选择性状态空间骨干网络，通过状态空间对偶性实现循环和卷积扫描，具有硬件感知流式和近线性扩展。将本体感知状态和外感知观察编码为紧凑token，通过堆叠SSD-Mamba2层进行融合

Result: 在多样化运动控制场景中，该方法在回报、安全性（碰撞和跌倒）和样本效率方面持续超越强基线方法，同时在相同计算预算下收敛更快

Conclusion: SSD-Mamba2为可扩展、有前瞻性和高效的端到端运动控制提供了实用的融合骨干网络

Abstract: End-to-end reinforcement learning for motion control promises unified
perception-action policies that scale across embodiments and tasks, yet most
deployed controllers are either blind (proprioception-only) or rely on fusion
backbones with unfavorable compute-memory trade-offs. Recurrent controllers
struggle with long-horizon credit assignment, and Transformer-based fusion
incurs quadratic cost in token length, limiting temporal and spatial context.
We present a vision-driven cross-modal RL framework built on SSD-Mamba2, a
selective state-space backbone that applies state-space duality (SSD) to enable
both recurrent and convolutional scanning with hardware-aware streaming and
near-linear scaling. Proprioceptive states and exteroceptive observations
(e.g., depth tokens) are encoded into compact tokens and fused by stacked
SSD-Mamba2 layers. The selective state-space updates retain long-range
dependencies with markedly lower latency and memory use than quadratic
self-attention, enabling longer look-ahead, higher token resolution, and stable
training under limited compute. Policies are trained end-to-end under curricula
that randomize terrain and appearance and progressively increase scene
complexity. A compact, state-centric reward balances task progress, energy
efficiency, and safety. Across diverse motion-control scenarios, our approach
consistently surpasses strong state-of-the-art baselines in return, safety
(collisions and falls), and sample efficiency, while converging faster at the
same compute budget. These results suggest that SSD-Mamba2 provides a practical
fusion backbone for scalable, foresightful, and efficient end-to-end motion
control.

Method: 采用提示工程策略处理70多个环境变量，通过模拟到真实的蒸馏方法将策略成功迁移到具有触觉感知的四指灵巧机械手上。

Result: Text2Touch显著优于精心调整的人工设计基准方法，展现出更优的旋转速度和稳定性，同时奖励函数比人工设计的简单一个数量级。

Conclusion: LLM设计的奖励函数可以显著缩短从概念到可部署灵巧触觉技能的时间，支持更快速和可扩展的多模态机器人学习。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are beginning to automate reward design for
dexterous manipulation. However, no prior work has considered tactile sensing,
which is known to be critical for human-like dexterity. We present Text2Touch,
bringing LLM-crafted rewards to the challenging task of multi-axis in-hand
object rotation with real-world vision based tactile sensing in palm-up and
palm-down configurations. Our prompt engineering strategy scales to over 70
environment variables, and sim-to-real distillation enables successful policy
transfer to a tactile-enabled fully actuated four-fingered dexterous robot
hand. Text2Touch significantly outperforms a carefully tuned human-engineered
baseline, demonstrating superior rotation speed and stability while relying on
reward functions that are an order of magnitude shorter and simpler. These
results illustrate how LLM-designed rewards can significantly reduce the time
from concept to deployable dexterous tactile skills, supporting more rapid and

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RaC是一种在模仿学习预训练后增加人类干预回放训练阶段的新方法，通过人类纠正行为提升机器人策略的恢复和适应能力，显著提高长时程任务的效率和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于人类遥操作的专家数据收集方法效率低下，导致接触丰富、可变形物体和长时程任务的性能远低于完美执行水平，即使使用数千条专家演示也是如此。

Method: 在模仿学习预训练后，通过人类干预回放训练(RaC)阶段：人类操作员在策略执行即将失败时介入，先将机器人回退到熟悉的状态分布内状态，然后提供完成当前子任务的纠正片段。

Result: 在三个真实世界双手机器人控制任务（衬衫悬挂、密封容器盖、外卖盒打包）和一个模拟装配任务中，RaC使用10倍少的数据收集时间和样本就超越了先前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: RaC通过训练恢复和纠正行为扩展了机器人技能库，实现了测试时性能扩展：训练后的RaC策略性能与其展示的恢复操作数量呈线性比例关系。

Abstract: Modern paradigms for robot imitation train expressive policy architectures on
large amounts of human demonstration data. Yet performance on contact-rich,
deformable-object, and long-horizon tasks plateau far below perfect execution,
even with thousands of expert demonstrations. This is due to the inefficiency
of existing ``expert'' data collection procedures based on human teleoperation.
To address this issue, we introduce RaC, a new phase of training on
human-in-the-loop rollouts after imitation learning pre-training. In RaC, we
fine-tune a robotic policy on human intervention trajectories that illustrate
recovery and correction behaviors. Specifically, during a policy rollout, human
operators intervene when failure appears imminent, first rewinding the robot
back to a familiar, in-distribution state and then providing a corrective
segment that completes the current sub-task. Training on this data composition
expands the robotic skill repertoire to include retry and adaptation behaviors,
which we show are crucial for boosting both efficiency and robustness on
long-horizon tasks. Across three real-world bimanual control tasks: shirt
hanging, airtight container lid sealing, takeout box packing, and a simulated
assembly task, RaC outperforms the prior state-of-the-art using 10$\times$ less
data collection time and samples. We also show that RaC enables test-time
scaling: the performance of the trained RaC policy scales linearly in the
number of recovery maneuvers it exhibits. Videos of the learned policy are
available at https://rac-scaling-robot.github.io/.

Motivation: 身体活动作为可改变的生活方式因素，具有支持认知弹性的潜力，但中强度运动的强度和时间与认知功能及特定脑区结构的关联仍不明确

Method: 分析了45,892名60岁及以上UK Biobank参与者的手腕加速计数据、认知测试和结构性脑部MRI数据，使用多变量线性模型评估关联性

Result: 高强度运动与更好的认知功能相关，包括推理、记忆、执行功能和处理速度，也与尾状核、壳核等脑区结构相关，中午到晚上时间段效果特别显著

Conclusion: 高强度运动与晚年脑部结构保持和认知功能增强相关，公共卫生策略增加运动有助于健康老年认知，预计到2050年全球年经济收益达7600亿美元

Abstract: Physical activity is a modifiable lifestyle factor with potential to support
cognitive resilience. However, the association of moderate-to-vigorous physical
activity (MVPA) intensity, and timing, with cognitive function and
region-specific brain structure remain poorly understood. We analyzed data from
45,892 UK Biobank participants aged 60 years and older with valid wrist-worn
accelerometer data, cognitive testing, and structural brain MRI. MVPA was
measured both continuously (mins per week) and categorically (thresholded using
>=150 min/week based on WHO guidelines). Associations with cognitive
performance and regional brain volumes were evaluated using multivariable
linear models adjusted for demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related
covariates. We conducted secondary analyses on MVPA timing and subgroup
effects. Higher MVPA was associated with better performance across cognitive
domains, including reasoning, memory, executive function, and processing speed.
These associations persisted in fully adjusted models and were higher among
participants meeting WHO guidelines. Greater MVPA was also associated with
subcortical brain regions (caudate, putamen, pallidum, thalamus), as well as
regional gray matter volumes involved in emotion, working memory, and
perceptual processing. Secondary analyses showed that MVPA at any time of day
was associated with cognitive functions and brain volume particularly in the
midday-afternoon and evening. Sensitivity analysis shows consistent findings
across subgroups, with evidence of dose-response relationships. Higher MVPA is
associated with preserved brain structure and enhanced cognitive function in
later life. Public health strategies to increase MVPA may support healthy
cognitive aging and generate substantial economic benefits, with global gains
projected to reach USD 760 billion annually by 2050.

Abstract: This study explores how the selection of neuron models and learning rules
impacts the classification performance of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with
a focus on applications in bio-signal processing. We compare biologically
inspired neuron models, including Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF), metaneurons,
and probabilistic Levy-Baxter (LB) neurons, across multiple learning rules,
including spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), tempotron, and
reward-modulated updates. A novel element of this work is the integration of a
complexity-based decision mechanism into the evaluation pipeline. Using
Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC), a measure related to entropy rate, we quantify the
structural regularity of spike trains and assess classification outcomes in a
consistent and interpretable manner across different SNN configurations. To
investigate neural dynamics and assess algorithm performance, we employed
synthetic datasets with varying temporal dependencies and stochasticity levels.
These included Markov and Poisson processes, well-established models to
simulate neuronal spike trains and capture the stochastic firing behavior of
biological neurons.Validation of synthetic Poisson and Markov-modeled data
reveals clear performance trends: classification accuracy depends on the
interaction between neuron model, network size, and learning rule, with the
LZC-based evaluation highlighting configurations that remain robust to weak or
noisy signals. This work delivers a systematic analysis of how neuron model
selection interacts with network parameters and learning strategies, supported
by a novel complexity-based evaluation approach that offers a consistent
benchmark for SNN performance.

Motivation: 基于对人类心理建模方法的综述，旨在构建人工心理系统，将心理视为生物或人工主体的操作系统，包含需求空间和智能决策系统。

Method: 提出认知架构概念，将心理视为操作系统，包含需求空间和外部世界刺激相关的生命意义，智能作为决策系统。提出计算形式化方法，通过在需求空间中从经验学习来创建人工智能系统。

Result: 形式化了构建通用人工智能的问题，即在特定代理需求空间中做出最优决策，最大化目标达成成功率，最小化存在风险，最大化能源效率。提供了最小实验实现。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建具有生物或存在意义的人工智能系统提供了新的认知架构框架和计算形式化方法，为解决通用人工智能问题提供了理论基础和实验验证。

Abstract: The article provides an overview of approaches to modeling the human psyche
in the perspective of building an artificial one. Based on the review, a
concept of cognitive architecture is proposed, where the psyche is considered
as an operating system of a living or artificial subject, including a space of
needs that determines its life meanings in connection with stimuli from the
external world, and intelligence as a decision-making system for actions in
relation to this world in order to satisfy these needs. Based on the concept, a
computational formalization is proposed for creating artificial intelligence
systems through learning from experience in the space of a space of needs,
taking into account their biological or existential significance for an
intelligent agent. Thus, the problem of building general artificial
intelligence as a system for making optimal decisions in the space of
agent-specific needs under conditions of uncertainty is formalized, with
maximization of success in achieving goals, minimization of existential risks
and maximization of energy efficiency. A minimal experimental implementation of
the model is also provided.

TL;DR: 深度学习MRI重建算法DeepFoqus-Accelerate可实现4倍加速脑部MRI扫描，在保持诊断质量的同时减少75%扫描时间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估深度学习MRI重建算法在加速脑部MRI扫描中是否能够保持诊断质量，解决传统MRI扫描时间过长的问题

Method: 使用前瞻性-回顾性研究设计，包括18名健康志愿者和fastMRI公共数据集，采用相位编码欠采样2D/3D T1、T2和FLAIR序列，通过DeepFoqus-Accelerate重建并与标准护理(SOC)比较，由3名神经放射学家和2名MRI技师独立评估

Result: 所有AI重建扫描评分均≥3分(最低可接受)，95%评分≥4分；平均SSIM为0.95±0.03(90%病例>0.90)，PSNR>41.0 dB，HaarPSI>0.94；罕见伪影不影响诊断解释

Conclusion: DeepFoqus-Accelerate能够实现稳健的4倍脑部MRI加速，在保持诊断图像质量的同时显著提高工作流程效率

Abstract: This retrospective-prospective study evaluated whether a deep learning-based
MRI reconstruction algorithm can preserve diagnostic quality in brain MRI scans
accelerated up to fourfold, using both public and prospective clinical data.
The study included 18 healthy volunteers (scans acquired at 3T, January
2024-March 2025), as well as selected fastMRI public datasets with diverse
pathologies. Phase-encoding-undersampled 2D/3D T1, T2, and FLAIR sequences were
reconstructed with DeepFoqus-Accelerate and compared with standard-of-care
(SOC). Three board-certified neuroradiologists and two MRI technologists
independently reviewed 36 paired SOC/AI reconstructions from both datasets
using a 5-point Likert scale, while quantitative similarity was assessed for
408 scans and 1224 datasets using Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Haar wavelet-based Perceptual Similarity
Index (HaarPSI). No AI-reconstructed scan scored below 3 (minimally
acceptable), and 95% scored $\geq 4$. Mean SSIM was 0.95 $\pm$ 0.03 (90% cases
>0.90), PSNR >41.0 dB, and HaarPSI >0.94. Inter-rater agreement was slight to
moderate. Rare artifacts did not affect diagnostic interpretation. These
findings demonstrate that DeepFoqus-Accelerate enables robust fourfold brain
MRI acceleration with 75% reduced scan time, while preserving diagnostic image
quality and supporting improved workflow efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出PGDiT方法，通过物理引导的扩散变换器实现dMRI角度超分辨率，在训练和推理阶段都整合物理先验，显著提升角度细节恢复和数据保真度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在恢复细粒度角度细节和保持高保真度方面存在局限，主要由于对q空间几何建模不足和物理约束整合不充分

Method: 训练阶段使用QGAM模块进行方向感知表示学习；推理阶段采用两阶段SHPS采样和热扩散SH正则化，实现从粗到细的细化策略

Result: 在通用ASR任务和DTI、NODDI下游应用中，PGDiT在细节恢复和数据保真度方面优于现有深度学习模型

Conclusion: PGDiT提供了一个新颖的生成式ASR框架，能够实现高保真度的HAR dMRI重建，在神经科学和临床研究中具有应用潜力

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) angular super-resolution (ASR) aims to reconstruct
high-angular-resolution (HAR) signals from limited low-angular-resolution (LAR)
data without prolonging scan time. However, existing methods are limited in
recovering fine-grained angular details or preserving high fidelity due to
inadequate modeling of q-space geometry and insufficient incorporation of
physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce a Physics-Guided Diffusion
Transformer (PGDiT) designed to explore physical priors throughout both
training and inference stages. During training, a Q-space Geometry-Aware Module
(QGAM) with b-vector modulation and random angular masking facilitates
direction-aware representation learning, enabling the network to generate
directionally consistent reconstructions with fine angular details from sparse
and noisy data. In inference, a two-stage Spherical Harmonics-Guided Posterior
Sampling (SHPS) enforces alignment with the acquired data, followed by
heat-diffusion-based SH regularization to ensure physically plausible
reconstructions. This coarse-to-fine refinement strategy mitigates
oversmoothing and artifacts commonly observed in purely data-driven or
generative models. Extensive experiments on general ASR tasks and two
downstream applications, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and Neurite Orientation
Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI), demonstrate that PGDiT outperforms
existing deep learning models in detail recovery and data fidelity. Our
approach presents a novel generative ASR framework that offers high-fidelity
HAR dMRI reconstructions, with potential applications in neuroscience and
clinical research.

TL;DR: 开发了双分支深度学习架构PUUMA，使用T2*胎儿MRI数据预测分娩孕周，在295例妊娠中表现良好，与临床宫颈长度测量相当，为自动预测分娩时间提供了概念验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早产是儿童死亡和终身发病的主要原因，其复杂和多因素起源限制了当前临床预测因子的有效性，阻碍了最佳护理。

Method: 开发双分支深度学习架构PUUMA，整合全局全子宫和局部胎盘特征，使用295例妊娠的T2*胎儿MRI数据，与线性回归和其他深度学习架构进行基准测试。

Result: 全自动MRI流程和宫颈长度回归都达到了可比较的平均绝对误差（3周）和良好的早产检测敏感性（0.67），尽管数据集存在明显的类别不平衡。

Conclusion: 研究证明了从功能MRI自动预测分娩孕周的可行性，强调了全子宫功能成像在识别高危妊娠中的价值，未来将扩大队列规模并纳入更多器官特异性成像。

Abstract: Preterm birth is a major cause of mortality and lifelong morbidity in
childhood. Its complex and multifactorial origins limit the effectiveness of
current clinical predictors and impede optimal care. In this study, a
dual-branch deep learning architecture (PUUMA) was developed to predict
gestational age (GA) at birth using T2* fetal MRI data from 295 pregnancies,
encompassing a heterogeneous and imbalanced population. The model integrates
both global whole-uterus and local placental features. Its performance was
benchmarked against linear regression using cervical length measurements
obtained by experienced clinicians from anatomical MRI and other Deep Learning
architectures. The GA at birth predictions were assessed using mean absolute
error. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were used to assess preterm
classification. Both the fully automated MRI-based pipeline and the cervical
length regression achieved comparable mean absolute errors (3 weeks) and good
sensitivity (0.67) for detecting preterm birth, despite pronounced class
imbalance in the dataset. These results provide a proof of concept for
automated prediction of GA at birth from functional MRI, and underscore the
value of whole-uterus functional imaging in identifying at-risk pregnancies.
Additionally, we demonstrate that manual, high-definition cervical length
measurements derived from MRI, not currently routine in clinical practice,
offer valuable predictive information. Future work will focus on expanding the
cohort size and incorporating additional organ-specific imaging to improve
generalisability and predictive performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动分割视网膜层耗时且变异性大，传统深度学习模型缺乏可解释性，需要既准确又可信赖的自动化分割方案。

Method: 提出基于SegNet的改进框架，包括修改的池化策略、混合损失函数（类别交叉熵+ Dice损失）以及集成Grad-CAM提供可解释性。

Result: 在Duke OCT数据集上达到95.77%的验证准确率，Dice系数0.9446，Jaccard指数为0.8951，在大多数层上表现稳健，Grad-CAM可视化显示了与解剖相关的关键区域。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种既高效又可解释的视网膜层分割方案，有助于标准化OCT分析、提高诊断效率并增强临床对AI工具的信任。

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is essential for diagnosing conditions
such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration.
Accurate retinal layer segmentation enables quantitative biomarkers critical
for clinical decision-making, but manual segmentation is time-consuming and
variable, while conventional deep learning models often lack interpretability.
This work proposes an improved SegNet-based deep learning framework for
automated and interpretable retinal layer segmentation. Architectural
innovations, including modified pooling strategies, enhance feature extraction
from noisy OCT images, while a hybrid loss function combining categorical
cross-entropy and Dice loss improves performance for thin and imbalanced
retinal layers. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is
integrated to provide visual explanations, allowing clinical validation of
model decisions. Trained and validated on the Duke OCT dataset, the framework
achieved 95.77% validation accuracy, a Dice coefficient of 0.9446, and a
Jaccard Index (IoU) of 0.8951. Class-wise results confirmed robust performance
across most layers, with challenges remaining for thinner boundaries. Grad-CAM
visualizations highlighted anatomically relevant regions, aligning segmentation
with clinical biomarkers and improving transparency. By combining architectural
improvements, a customized hybrid loss, and explainable AI, this study delivers
a high-performing SegNet-based framework that bridges the gap between accuracy
and interpretability. The approach offers strong potential for standardizing
OCT analysis, enhancing diagnostic efficiency, and fostering clinical trust in
AI-driven ophthalmic tools.

Motivation: 大规模AI发展对计算能力的需求激增，传统电子平台面临能源、带宽和扩展性限制，需要寻找更可持续的高性能计算解决方案。

Method: 采用电子-光电设计自动化(EPDA)工具和跨层设备-电路-架构协同设计方法，实现更紧凑的布局生成、可重构硬件拓扑和智能容错机制。

Result: 光电AI系统相比先进数字电子集成电路，在减少碳足迹的同时提供数量级更高的计算性能和互连带宽，实现终身可持续性。

Conclusion: 光电集成AI系统能够同时满足现代AI的性能需求和可持续发展的紧迫要求，为下一代可持续计算提供可行路径。

Abstract: The relentless growth of large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) has created
unprecedented demand for computational power, straining the energy, bandwidth,
and scaling limits of conventional electronic platforms. Electronic-photonic
integrated circuits (EPICs) have emerged as a compelling platform for
next-generation AI systems, offering inherent advantages in ultra-high
bandwidth, low latency, and energy efficiency for computing and
interconnection. Beyond performance, EPICs also hold unique promises for
sustainability. Fabricated in relaxed process nodes with fewer metal layers and
lower defect densities, photonic devices naturally reduce embodied carbon
footprint (CFP) compared to advanced digital electronic integrated circuits,
while delivering orders-of-magnitude higher computing performance and
interconnect bandwidth. To further advance the sustainability of photonic AI
systems, we explore how electronic-photonic design automation (EPDA) and
cross-layer co-design methodologies can amplify these inherent benefits. We
present how advanced EPDA tools enable more compact layout generation, reducing
both chip area and metal layer usage. We will also demonstrate how cross-layer
device-circuit-architecture co-design unlocks new sustainability gains for
photonic hardware: ultra-compact photonic circuit designs that minimize chip
area cost, reconfigurable hardware topology that adapts to evolving AI
workloads, and intelligent resilience mechanisms that prolong lifetime by
tolerating variations and faults. By uniting intrinsic photonic efficiency with
EPDA- and co-design-driven gains in area efficiency, reconfigurability, and
robustness, we outline a vision for lifelong-sustainable electronic-photonic AI
systems. This perspective highlights how EPIC AI systems can simultaneously
meet the performance demands of modern AI and the urgent imperative for
sustainable computing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然过去几年发展了多种覆盖广泛元素的通用性原子间潜力，但它们在具体化学系统中的适用性需要详细评估

Method: 选择多样化的通用性潜力进行对比，包括两类：通用分析潜力（GFN-FF、UFF、Dreiding）和预训练机器学习潜力（CHGNet、ORB-v3等），以实验数据和DFT计算为参考标准

Result: GFN-FF在通用分析潜力中表现最好，但对高应力硅圆环和铝硅酸盐系统不满意；所有机器学习潜力都能良好重现实验或DFT级别的结构和能量，eSEN-30M-OAM模型在所有分子筛结构中表现最一致

Conclusion: 现代预训练的通用性机器学习潜力是分子筛高速筛选工作流中的实用工具，特别适用于包含多种组成的系统

Abstract: Interatomic potentials (IPs) with wide elemental coverage and high accuracy
are powerful tools for high-throughput materials discovery. While the past few
years witnessed the development of multiple new universal IPs that cover wide
ranges of the periodic table, their applicability to target chemical systems
should be carefully investigated. We benchmark several universal IPs using
equilibrium zeolite structures as testbeds. We select a diverse set of
universal IPs encompassing two major categories: (i) universal analytic IPs,
including GFN-FF, UFF, and Dreiding; (ii) pretrained universal machine learning
IPs (MLIPs), comprising CHGNet, ORB-v3, MatterSim, eSEN-30M-OAM, PFP-v7, and
EquiformerV2-lE4-lF100-S2EFS-OC22. We compare them with established tailor-made
IPs, SLC, ClayFF, and BSFF using experimental data and density functional
theory (DFT) calculations with dispersion correction as the reference. The
tested zeolite structures comprise pure silica frameworks and aluminosilicates
containing copper species, potassium, and organic cations. We found that GFN-FF
is the best among the tested universal analytic IPs, but it does not achieve
satisfactory accuracy for highly strained silica rings and aluminosilicate
systems. All MLIPs can well reproduce experimental or DFT-level geometries and
energetics. Among the universal MLIPs, the eSEN-30M-OAM model shows the most
consistent performance across all zeolite structures studied. These findings
show that the modern pretrained universal MLIPs are practical tools in zeolite
screening workflows involving various compositions.

Abstract: Causal relationships play a fundamental role in understanding the world
around us. The ability to identify and understand cause-effect relationships is
critical to making informed decisions, predicting outcomes, and developing
effective strategies. However, deciphering causal relationships from
observational data is a difficult task, as correlations alone may not provide
definitive evidence of causality. In recent years, the field of machine
learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool, offering new opportunities for
uncovering hidden causal mechanisms and better understanding complex systems.
In this work, we address the issue of detecting the intrinsic causal links of a
large class of complex systems in the framework of the response theory in
physics. We develop some theoretical ideas put forward by [1], and technically
we use state-of-the-art ML techniques to build up models from data. We consider
both linear stochastic and non-linear systems. Finally, we compute the
asymptotic efficiency of the linear response based causal predictor in a case
of large scale Markov process network of linear interactions.

Motivation: 理解开发者进行代码重构的原因以及哪些指标能够捕捉这些动机，以支持更广泛和有效的重构实践应用。

Method: 通过大规模实证研究分析开发者重构活动，利用大语言模型从版本控制数据中识别底层动机，并与文献中先前报告的动机进行比较。

Result: LLMs在80%的情况下与人类判断匹配，但与文献动机仅47%一致；丰富了22%的动机细节，主要强调可读性、清晰度和结构改进；大多数动机是实用性的，关注简化和可维护性；开发经验和代码可读性相关指标排名最高，但与动机类别的相关性较弱。

Conclusion: LLMs能有效捕捉表面层动机但在架构推理方面存在困难，其价值在于提供局部化解释，与软件指标结合可形成混合方法，为更系统地优先处理重构和平衡短期改进与长期架构目标提供有前景的路径。

Abstract: Context. Code refactoring improves software quality without changing external
behavior. Despite its advantages, its benefits are hindered by the considerable
cost of time, resources, and continuous effort it demands. Aim. Understanding
why developers refactor, and which metrics capture these motivations, may
support wider and more effective use of refactoring in practice. Method. We
performed a large-scale empirical study to analyze developers refactoring
activity, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify underlying
motivations from version control data, comparing our findings with previous
motivations reported in the literature. Results. LLMs matched human judgment in
80% of cases, but aligned with literature-based motivations in only 47%. They
enriched 22% of motivations with more detailed rationale, often highlighting
readability, clarity, and structural improvements. Most motivations were
pragmatic, focused on simplification and maintainability. While metrics related
to developer experience and code readability ranked highest, their correlation
with motivation categories was weak. Conclusions. We conclude that LLMs
effectively capture surface-level motivations but struggle with architectural
reasoning. Their value lies in providing localized explanations, which, when
combined with software metrics, can form hybrid approaches. Such integration
offers a promising path toward prioritizing refactoring more systematically and
balancing short-term improvements with long-term architectural goals.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models
(LLMs) has opened up new opportunities in the area of cybersecurity, especially
in the exploitation automation landscape and penetration testing. This study
explores Android penetration testing automation using LLM-based tools,
especially PentestGPT, to identify and execute rooting techniques. Through a
comparison of the traditional manual rooting process and exploitation methods
produced using AI, this study evaluates the efficacy, reliability, and
scalability of automated penetration testing in achieving high-level privilege
access on Android devices. With the use of an Android emulator (Genymotion) as
the testbed, we fully execute both traditional and exploit-based rooting
methods, automating the process using AI-generated scripts. Secondly, we create
a web application by integrating OpenAI's API to facilitate automated script
generation from LLM-processed responses. The research focuses on the
effectiveness of AI-enabled exploitation by comparing automated and manual
penetration testing protocols, by determining LLM weaknesses and strengths
along the way. We also provide security suggestions of AI-enabled exploitation,
including ethical factors and potential misuse. The findings exhibit that while
LLMs can significantly streamline the workflow of exploitation, they need to be
controlled by humans to ensure accuracy and ethical application. This study
adds to the increasing body of literature on AI-powered cybersecurity and its
effect on ethical hacking, security research, and mobile device security.

Abstract: This paper introduces ArGen (Auto-Regulation of Generative AI systems), a
framework for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with complex sets of
configurable, machine-readable rules spanning ethical principles, operational
safety protocols, and regulatory compliance standards. Moving beyond just
preference-based alignment, ArGen is designed to ensure LLMs adhere to these
multifaceted policies through a novel synthesis of principle-based automated
reward scoring, Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO), and an Open Policy
Agent (OPA) inspired governance layer. This approach provides the technical
foundation for achieving and demonstrating compliance with diverse and nuanced
governance requirements. To showcase the framework's capability to
operationalize a deeply nuanced and culturally-specific value system, we
present an in-depth case study: the development of a medical AI assistant
guided by principles from Dharmic ethics (such as Ahimsa and Dharma), as
derived from texts like the Bhagavad Gita. This challenging application
demonstrates ArGen's adaptability, achieving a 70.9% improvement in
domain-scope adherence over the baseline. Through our open-source repository,
we show that ArGen's methodology offers a path to 'Governable Al' systems that
are technically proficient, ethically robust, and verifiably compliant for safe
deployment in diverse global contexts.

avoidable failure that underscores the risks of unsafe AI in healthcare
contexts. This paper examines Tessa as a case study in absent safety
engineering and demonstrates how a lightweight, modular safeguard could have
prevented the incident. We propose a hybrid safety middleware that combines
deterministic lexical gates with an in-line large language model (LLM) policy
filter, enforcing fail-closed verdicts and escalation pathways within a single
model call. Using synthetic evaluations, we show that this design achieves
perfect interception of unsafe prompts at baseline cost and latency,
outperforming traditional multi-stage pipelines. Beyond technical remedies, we
map Tessa's failure patterns to established frameworks (OWASP LLM Top10, NIST
SP 800-53), connecting practical safeguards to actionable governance controls.
The results highlight that robust, auditable safety in health-adjacent AI does
not require heavyweight infrastructure: explicit, testable checks at the last
mile are sufficient to prevent "another Tessa", while governance and escalation
ensure sustainability in real-world deployment.

Method: 通过案例分析和数据展示，考察AI在绘画、雕塑、书法、舞蹈、音乐和工艺美术等领域的应用，分析其对创作民主化、生产力提升和文化保护的影响。

Result: AI能够 democratize 创意表达、提高生产力、保护文化遗产，但同时也带来真实性威胁、数据伦理问题和社会经济影响（如失业风险）。

Conclusion: AI的影响具有情境依赖性，需要发展伦理指南、协作方法和包容性技术开发，确保AI增强人类创造力而非替代艺术家的灵魂，未来取决于人类如何治理AI以实现艺术进化。

Abstract: The introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the domains of
traditional art (visual arts, performing arts, and crafts) has sparked a
complicated discussion about whether this might be an agent of disruption or an
enhancement of our traditional art forms. This paper looks at the duality of
AI, exploring the ways that recent technologies like Generative Adversarial
Networks and Diffusion Models, and text-to-image generators are changing the
fields of painting, sculpture, calligraphy, dance, music, and the arts of
craft. Using examples and data, we illustrate the ways that AI can democratize
creative expression, improve productivity, and preserve cultural heritage,
while also examining the negative aspects, including: the threats to
authenticity within art, ethical concerns around data, and issues including
socio-economic factors such as job losses. While we argue for the
context-dependence of the impact of AI (the potential for creative
homogenization and the devaluation of human agency in artmaking), we also
illustrate the potential for hybrid practices featuring AI in cuisine, etc. We
advocate for the development of ethical guidelines, collaborative approaches,
and inclusive technology development. In sum, we are articulating a vision of
AI in which it amplifies our innate creativity while resisting the displacement
of the cultural, nuanced, and emotional aspects of traditional art. The future
will be determined by human choices about how to govern AI so that it becomes a
mechanism for artistic evolution and not a substitute for the artist's soul.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) across industry,
government, and education highlights the urgent need for robust frameworks to
conceptualise and guide engagement. This paper introduces the Hierarchy of
Engagement with AI model, a novel maturity framework inspired by Maslow's
hierarchy of needs. The model conceptualises AI adoption as a progression
through eight levels, beginning with initial exposure and basic understanding
and culminating in ecosystem collaboration and societal impact. Each level
integrates technical, organisational, and ethical dimensions, emphasising that
AI maturity is not only a matter of infrastructure and capability but also of
trust, governance, and responsibility. Initial validation of the model using
four diverse case studies (General Motors, the Government of Estonia, the
University of Texas System, and the African Union AI Strategy) demonstrate the
model's contextual flexibility across various sectors. The model provides
scholars with a framework for analysing AI maturity and offers practitioners
and policymakers a diagnostic and strategic planning tool to guide responsible
and sustainable AI engagement. The proposed model demonstrates that AI maturity
progression is multi-dimensional, requiring technological capability, ethical
integrity, organisational resilience, and ecosystem collaboration.
