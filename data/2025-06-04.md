### [2] [No Free Lunch in Active Learning: LLM Embedding Quality Dictates Query Strategy Success](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01992)
*Lukas Rauch,Moritz Wirth,Denis Huseljic,Marek Herde,Bernhard Sick,Matthias Aßenmacher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLM）嵌入提升深度主动学习（AL）的实用性，发现嵌入质量和查询策略选择对性能有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过利用冻结的LLM嵌入，降低深度AL中迭代微调大模型的成本，并研究嵌入质量对AL策略的影响。

Method: 使用MTEB排行榜上的五个高性能模型和两个基线模型，在十个文本分类任务上系统评估嵌入质量和查询策略的关系。

Result: 发现多样性采样与高质量嵌入协同提升早期AL性能，且查询策略效果依赖于嵌入质量，Badge等策略更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 强调AL策略需结合嵌入质量和目标任务进行上下文评估，嵌入质量对策略选择至关重要。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) capable of producing
general-purpose representations lets us revisit the practicality of deep active
learning (AL): By leveraging frozen LLM embeddings, we can mitigate the
computational costs of iteratively fine-tuning large backbones. This study
establishes a benchmark and systematically investigates the influence of LLM
embedding quality on query strategies in deep AL. We employ five top-performing
models from the massive text embedding benchmark (MTEB) leaderboard and two
baselines for ten diverse text classification tasks. Our findings reveal key
insights: First, initializing the labeled pool using diversity-based sampling
synergizes with high-quality embeddings, boosting performance in early AL
iterations. Second, the choice of the optimal query strategy is sensitive to
embedding quality. While the computationally inexpensive Margin sampling can
achieve performance spikes on specific datasets, we find that strategies like
Badge exhibit greater robustness across tasks. Importantly, their effectiveness
is often enhanced when paired with higher-quality embeddings. Our results
emphasize the need for context-specific evaluation of AL strategies, as
performance heavily depends on embedding quality and the target task.

### [3] [NovelHopQA: Diagnosing Multi-Hop Reasoning Failures in Long Narrative Contexts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02000)
*Abhay Gupta,Michael Lu,Kevin Zhu,Sean O'Brien,Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NovelHopQA是一个新基准，用于评估在64k-128k令牌的长文本中进行1-4跳问答的能力，揭示当前大模型在多跳推理和长上下文理解上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在长文本和多跳推理任务中表现不佳，缺乏联合评估这两者的基准。

Method: 通过关键词引导的管道构建基于连贯故事情节的多跳问答链，评估六种先进模型，并使用人类标注验证。

Result: 模型在多跳和长上下文任务中准确性下降，表明规模不能保证推理能力。

Conclusion: NovelHopQA为大规模多跳推理提供了诊断工具，揭示了模型的常见失败模式。

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) struggle to answer questions that span
tens of thousands of tokens, especially when multi-hop reasoning is involved.
While prior benchmarks explore long-context comprehension or multi-hop
reasoning in isolation, none jointly vary context length and reasoning depth in
natural narrative settings. We introduce NovelHopQA, the first benchmark to
evaluate k1-4 hop QA over 64k-128k-token excerpts from 83 full-length
public-domain novels. A keyword-guided pipeline builds hop-separated chains
grounded in coherent storylines. We evaluate six state-of-the-art (SOTA) models
and apply oracle-context filtering to ensure all questions are genuinely
answerable. Human annotators validate both alignment and hop depth. We noticed
consistent accuracy drops with increased hops and context length, even in
frontier models-revealing that sheer scale does not guarantee robust reasoning.
Our failure mode analysis highlights common breakdowns, such as missed
final-hop integration and long-range drift. NovelHopQA offers a controlled
diagnostic setting to stress-test multi-hop reasoning at scale.

### [4] [Pruning for Performance: Efficient Idiom and Metaphor Classification in Low-Resource Konkani Using mBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02005)
*Timothy Do,Pranav Saran,Harshita Poojary,Pranav Prabhu,Sean O'Brien,Vasu Sharma,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合mBERT、双向LSTM和线性分类器的混合模型，用于解决低资源语言（如Konkani）中比喻语言处理的挑战，并通过梯度注意力头剪枝提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然语言处理系统在低资源语言中处理比喻语言的难题。

Method: 采用混合模型（mBERT+双向LSTM+线性分类器），并引入梯度注意力头剪枝策略。

Result: 比喻分类任务准确率达78%，习语分类任务达83%。

Conclusion: 注意力头剪枝对低资源语言的高效NLP工具构建有效。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the persistent challenges that figurative language
expressions pose for natural language processing (NLP) systems, particularly in
low-resource languages such as Konkani. We present a hybrid model that
integrates a pre-trained Multilingual BERT (mBERT) with a bidirectional LSTM
and a linear classifier. This architecture is fine-tuned on a newly introduced
annotated dataset for metaphor classification, developed as part of this work.
To improve the model's efficiency, we implement a gradient-based attention head
pruning strategy. For metaphor classification, the pruned model achieves an
accuracy of 78%. We also applied our pruning approach to expand on an existing
idiom classification task, achieving 83% accuracy. These results demonstrate
the effectiveness of attention head pruning for building efficient NLP tools in
underrepresented languages.

### [5] [Enhancing Paraphrase Type Generation: The Impact of DPO and RLHF Evaluated with Human-Ranked Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02018)
*Christopher Lee Lübbers*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过人类排名数据集和直接偏好优化（DPO）方法，提升了生成语义准确且符合人类偏好的改写类型的能力，并在下游任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有改写类型生成方法因依赖自动化指标和有限的人类标注数据，导致与人类偏好不一致，语义保真度和语言转换能力不足。

Method: 利用人类排名的改写类型数据集，结合DPO方法直接对齐模型输出与人类判断。

Result: DPO训练使改写类型生成准确率提升3个百分点，人类偏好评分提高7个百分点；检测模型在多种改写类型上表现优异。

Conclusion: 偏好数据和DPO训练能生成更可靠、语义准确的改写，为下游应用提供支持，并推动基于人类标准的改写研究。

Abstract: Paraphrasing re-expresses meaning to enhance applications like text
simplification, machine translation, and question-answering. Specific
paraphrase types facilitate accurate semantic analysis and robust language
models. However, existing paraphrase-type generation methods often misalign
with human preferences due to reliance on automated metrics and limited
human-annotated training data, obscuring crucial aspects of semantic fidelity
and linguistic transformations.
  This study addresses this gap by leveraging a human-ranked paraphrase-type
dataset and integrating Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align model
outputs directly with human judgments. DPO-based training increases
paraphrase-type generation accuracy by 3 percentage points over a supervised
baseline and raises human preference ratings by 7 percentage points. A newly
created human-annotated dataset supports more rigorous future evaluations.
Additionally, a paraphrase-type detection model achieves F1 scores of 0.91 for
addition/deletion, 0.78 for same polarity substitution, and 0.70 for
punctuation changes.
  These findings demonstrate that preference data and DPO training produce more
reliable, semantically accurate paraphrases, enabling downstream applications
such as improved summarization and more robust question-answering. The PTD
model surpasses automated metrics and provides a more reliable framework for
evaluating paraphrase quality, advancing paraphrase-type research toward
richer, user-aligned language generation and establishing a stronger foundation
for future evaluations grounded in human-centric criteria.

Method: 结合CFD和OpenFOAM知识，构建结构化数据库，验证配置并实现错误反馈，提升语言模型的准确性和适应性。

Result: 验证表明，ChatCFD能自主复现已发表的CFD结果，处理复杂且未见过的配置。

Conclusion: ChatCFD通过语言模型与CFD知识的结合，显著降低了CFD的使用门槛，扩展了其应用范围。

Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is essential for scientific and
engineering advancements but is limited by operational complexity and the need
for extensive expertise. This paper presents ChatCFD, a large language
model-driven pipeline that automates CFD workflows within the OpenFOAM
framework. It enables users to configure and execute complex simulations from
natural language prompts or published literature with minimal expertise. The
innovation is its structured approach to database construction, configuration
validation, and error reflection, integrating CFD and OpenFOAM knowledge with
general language models to improve accuracy and adaptability. Validation shows
ChatCFD can autonomously reproduce published CFD results, handling complex,
unseen configurations beyond basic examples, a task challenging for general
language models.

### [7] [FinS-Pilot: A Benchmark for Online Financial System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02037)
*Feng Wang,Yiding Sun,Jiaxin Mao,Wei Xue,Danqing Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinS-Pilot是一个针对在线金融应用的RAG系统评估基准，解决了数据保密性和动态数据整合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融领域缺乏专门的RAG评估工具，且现有工具无法处理动态数据和静态知识的结合。

Method: 基于真实金融助手交互数据，结合实时API和结构化文本，构建意图分类框架。

Result: FinS-Pilot能有效评估金融助手处理静态知识和实时市场信息的能力，并筛选适合金融应用的LLM。

Conclusion: FinS-Pilot填补了金融领域专用评估工具的空白，提供了实用框架和数据集。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various professional domains, with their performance typically evaluated
through standardized benchmarks. However, the development of financial RAG
benchmarks has been constrained by data confidentiality issues and the lack of
dynamic data integration. To address this issue, we introduces FinS-Pilot, a
novel benchmark for evaluating RAG systems in online financial applications.
Constructed from real-world financial assistant interactions, our benchmark
incorporates both real-time API data and structured text sources, organized
through an intent classification framework covering critical financial domains
such as equity analysis and macroeconomic forecasting. The benchmark enables
comprehensive evaluation of financial assistants' capabilities in handling both
static knowledge and time-sensitive market information. Through systematic
experiments with multiple Chinese leading LLMs, we demonstrate FinS-Pilot's
effectiveness in identifying models suitable for financial applications while
addressing the current gap in specialized evaluation tools for the financial
domain. Our work contributes both a practical evaluation framework and a
curated dataset to advance research in financial NLP systems. The code and
dataset are accessible on
GitHub\footnote{https://github.com/PhealenWang/financial\_rag\_benchmark}.

### [8] [Enhancing Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning with BranchLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02041)
*Duzhen Zhang,Yong Ren,Zhong-Zhi Li,Yahan Yu,Jiahua Dong,Chenxing Li,Zhilong Ji,Jinfeng Bai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出BranchLoRA框架，解决多模态持续指令调优中的灾难性遗忘问题，提升效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如MoE LoRA）在持续任务中易因简单参数聚合导致灾难性遗忘，且参数效率低。

Method: 提出BranchLoRA框架，采用非对称设计和调优-冻结机制，结合任务特定路由器和任务选择器。

Result: 实验表明BranchLoRA显著优于MoELoRA，并在不同规模MLLM中保持优势。

Conclusion: BranchLoRA有效缓解灾难性遗忘，提升多模态持续指令调优的性能和效率。

Abstract: Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning (MCIT) aims to finetune Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to continually align with human intent across
sequential tasks. Existing approaches often rely on the Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) LoRA framework to preserve previous instruction alignments. However,
these methods are prone to Catastrophic Forgetting (CF), as they aggregate all
LoRA blocks via simple summation, which compromises performance over time. In
this paper, we identify a critical parameter inefficiency in the MoELoRA
framework within the MCIT context. Based on this insight, we propose
BranchLoRA, an asymmetric framework to enhance both efficiency and performance.
To mitigate CF, we introduce a flexible tuning-freezing mechanism within
BranchLoRA, enabling branches to specialize in intra-task knowledge while
fostering inter-task collaboration. Moreover, we incrementally incorporate
task-specific routers to ensure an optimal branch distribution over time,
rather than favoring the most recent task. To streamline inference, we
introduce a task selector that automatically routes test inputs to the
appropriate router without requiring task identity. Extensive experiments on
the latest MCIT benchmark demonstrate that BranchLoRA significantly outperforms
MoELoRA and maintains its superiority across various MLLM sizes.

### [9] [Evaluating the Unseen Capabilities: How Many Theorems Do LLMs Know?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02058)
*Xiang Li,Jiayi Xin,Qi Long,Weijie J. Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出KnowSum框架，用于量化大语言模型（LLM）评估中未观察到的知识，解决评估危机。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估未能全面反映其实际能力，主要原因是忽视了未观察到的知识。

Method: 引入KnowSum统计框架，通过外推观察到的知识实例频率来估计未观察部分。

Result: 实验表明，KnowSum能更全面评估LLM知识，显著改变常见LLM的排名。

Conclusion: KnowSum为LLM评估提供了更全面的视角，揭示了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for
understanding their capabilities and guiding their development. However,
current evaluations often inconsistently reflect the actual capacities of these
models. In this paper, we demonstrate that one of many contributing factors to
this \textit{evaluation crisis} is the oversight of unseen knowledge --
information encoded by LLMs but not directly observed or not yet observed
during evaluations. We introduce KnowSum, a statistical framework designed to
provide a more comprehensive assessment by quantifying the unseen knowledge for
a class of evaluation tasks. KnowSum estimates the unobserved portion by
extrapolating from the appearance frequencies of observed knowledge instances.
We demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of KnowSum across three critical
applications: estimating total knowledge, evaluating information retrieval
effectiveness, and measuring output diversity. Our experiments reveal that a
substantial volume of knowledge is omitted when relying solely on observed LLM
performance. Importantly, KnowSum yields significantly different comparative
rankings for several common LLMs based on their internal knowledge.

### [10] [Knowledge or Reasoning? A Close Look at How LLMs Think Across Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02126)
*Juncheng Wu,Sheng Liu,Haoqin Tu,Hang Yu,Xiaoke Huang,James Zou,Cihang Xie,Yuyin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了推理增强型大语言模型在医学和数学领域的内部推理过程，提出了一个细粒度评估框架，并发现监督微调和强化学习对推理质量的不同影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管推理增强型大语言模型在复杂任务上表现优异，但其内部推理过程的质量和透明度尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过将推理轨迹分解为知识和推理两部分，引入知识指数（KI）和信息增益（InfoGain）作为评估指标，研究了监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）对模型的影响。

Result: 研究发现：1）R1蒸馏模型的通用推理能力在医学领域效果不佳；2）SFT提高最终答案准确率但降低推理质量；3）RL通过修剪不准确知识提升医学推理。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在医学领域结合SFT和RL的重要性，以平衡知识正确性和推理质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning-enhanced Large Language Models such as
OpenAI-o1/3 and DeepSeek-R1 have significantly improved performance on complex
tasks. However, the quality and transparency of their internal reasoning
processes remain underexplored. This work moves beyond the final-answer
accuracy and investigates step-by-step reasoning in the medical and
mathematical domains by explicitly decomposing the thinking trajectories into
two parts: knowledge and reasoning. Specifically, we introduce a fine-grained
evaluation framework that judges: (1) the correctness of knowledge used
(measured by Knowledge Index (KI)) and (2) the quality of reasoning (measured
by Information Gain (InfoGain)). Using this framework, we study R1-distilled
and base Qwen models trained with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and/or
reinforcement learning (RL) in the medical and math domains. Three intriguing
findings emerge: (1) The general reasoning abilities in R1-distilled models do
not transfer effectively to the medical domain through either SFT or RL. (2)
SFT raises final-answer accuracy in both domains, but often at the cost of
reasoning quality: InfoGain drops by 38.9% on average compared with untrained
models; In the medical domain, however, SFT remains crucial because domain
knowledge is indispensable. (3) RL enhances medical reasoning by pruning
inaccurate or irrelevant knowledge from reasoning paths, thereby improving both
reasoning accuracy and knowledge correctness.

### [11] [Model Internal Sleuthing: Finding Lexical Identity and Inflectional Morphology in Modern Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02132)
*Michael Li,Nishant Subramani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了现代大型语言模型如何编码词汇和形态信息，发现词汇信息在早期层线性集中，后期层非线性集中，而形态信息在各层均线性可分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解现代大型语言模型如何编码语言信息，尤其是词汇和形态特征。

Method: 训练线性和非线性分类器，分析不同层激活对词汇和形态特征的预测能力。

Result: 词汇信息依赖记忆，形态信息通过抽象编码；所有模型均表现出相似模式。

Conclusion: 语言模型对语言信息的编码方式具有一致性，可能是预训练中学习的基本属性。

Abstract: Large transformer-based language models dominate modern NLP, yet our
understanding of how they encode linguistic information is rooted in studies of
early models like BERT and GPT-2. To better understand today's language models,
we investigate how both classical architectures (BERT, DeBERTa, GPT-2)and
contemporary large language models (Pythia, OLMo-2, Gemma-2, Qwen2.5,
Llama-3.1) represent lexical identity and inflectional morphology. We train
linear and nonlinear classifiers on layer-wise activations to predict word
lemmas and inflectional features. We discover that models concentrate lexical
information linearly in early layers and increasingly nonlinearly in later
layers, while keeping inflectional information uniformly accessible and
linearly separable throughout the layers. Further analysis reveals that these
models encode inflectional morphology through generalizable abstractions, but
rely predominantly on memorization to encode lexical identity. Remarkably,
these patterns emerge across all 16 models we test, despite differences in
architecture, size, and training regime (including pretrained and
instruction-tuned variants). This consistency suggests that, despite
substantial advances in LLM technologies, transformer models organize
linguistic information in similar ways, indicating that these properties could
be fundamental for next token prediction and are learned early during
pretraining. Our code is available at
https://github.com/ml5885/model_internal_sleuthing.

### [12] [BabyLM's First Constructions: Causal interventions provide a signal of learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02147)
*Joshua Rozner,Leonie Weissweiler,Cory Shain*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了在发育合理数据量下训练的模型是否能学习构造（形式-意义配对），发现模型能表示多样构造，且构造表现与基准测试表现相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证构造语法理论，即儿童通过环境统计学习构造，并探讨预训练语言模型（PLMs）在发育合理数据量下是否也能学习构造。

Method: 使用Rozner等人的方法评估2024 BabyLM挑战赛中模型的构造学习能力。

Result: 模型能表示多样构造，包括难以区分的案例，且构造表现与BabyLM基准测试表现相关。

Conclusion: 即使数据量合理，模型也能学习构造，且构造学习可能对模型性能有功能意义。

Abstract: Construction grammar posits that children acquire constructions (form-meaning
pairings) from the statistics of their environment. Recent work supports this
hypothesis by showing sensitivity to constructions in pretrained language
models (PLMs), including one recent study (Rozner et al., 2025) demonstrating
that constructions shape the PLM's output distribution. However, models under
study have generally been trained on developmentally implausible amounts of
data, casting doubt on their relevance to human language learning. Here we use
Rozner et al.'s methods to evaluate constructional learning in models from the
2024 BabyLM challenge. Our results show that even when trained on
developmentally plausible quantities of data, models represent diverse
constructions, even hard cases that are superficially indistinguishable. We
further find correlational evidence that constructional performance may be
functionally relevant: models that better represent constructions perform
better on the BabyLM benchmarks.

*Amir Hussein,Cihan Xiao,Matthew Wiesner,Dan Povey,Leibny Paola Garcia,Sanjeev Khudanpur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出HENT-SRT框架，通过分层任务分解和自蒸馏技术改进神经转录器在语音翻译中的性能，同时提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经转录器在语音翻译中面临词序重排和性能下降问题，且计算成本高。

Method: 采用分层任务分解、自蒸馏与CTC一致性正则化、降采样分层编码器、无状态预测器和修剪转录器损失。

Result: 在阿拉伯语、西班牙语和普通话数据集上取得新SOTA性能，显著缩小与AED模型的差距。

Conclusion: HENT-SRT有效解决了神经转录器在语音翻译中的问题，性能接近AED模型且计算高效。

Abstract: Neural transducers (NT) provide an effective framework for speech streaming,
demonstrating strong performance in automatic speech recognition (ASR).
However, the application of NT to speech translation (ST) remains challenging,
as existing approaches struggle with word reordering and performance
degradation when jointly modeling ASR and ST, resulting in a gap with
attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) models. Existing NT-based ST approaches
also suffer from high computational training costs. To address these issues, we
propose HENT-SRT (Hierarchical Efficient Neural Transducer for Speech
Recognition and Translation), a novel framework that factorizes ASR and
translation tasks to better handle reordering. To ensure robust ST while
preserving ASR performance, we use self-distillation with CTC consistency
regularization. Moreover, we improve computational efficiency by incorporating
best practices from ASR transducers, including a down-sampled hierarchical
encoder, a stateless predictor, and a pruned transducer loss to reduce training
complexity. Finally, we introduce a blank penalty during decoding, reducing
deletions and improving translation quality. Our approach is evaluated on three
conversational datasets Arabic, Spanish, and Mandarin achieving new
state-of-the-art performance among NT models and substantially narrowing the
gap with AED-based systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨语音翻译模型是否捕捉说话者性别特征及其对翻译性别分配的影响，发现传统模型能捕捉性别信息，而新架构则不能，且新架构更倾向于男性默认翻译。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究语音翻译模型是否像语音模型一样能捕捉说话者性别特征，以及这对翻译中性别分配的影响。

Method: 使用探测方法评估多种语音翻译模型中的性别编码能力，涵盖英法/意/西三种语言方向。

Result: 传统编码器-解码器模型能捕捉性别信息，而新架构（通过适配器整合语音编码器和翻译系统）不能，且新架构更倾向于男性默认翻译。

Conclusion: 语音翻译模型的架构差异影响性别编码能力，新架构可能导致更明显的男性默认翻译偏差。

Abstract: Recent studies on interpreting the hidden states of speech models have shown
their ability to capture speaker-specific features, including gender. Does this
finding also hold for speech translation (ST) models? If so, what are the
implications for the speaker's gender assignment in translation? We address
these questions from an interpretability perspective, using probing methods to
assess gender encoding across diverse ST models. Results on three language
directions (English-French/Italian/Spanish) indicate that while traditional
encoder-decoder models capture gender information, newer architectures --
integrating a speech encoder with a machine translation system via adapters --
do not. We also demonstrate that low gender encoding capabilities result in
systems' tendency toward a masculine default, a translation bias that is more
pronounced in newer architectures.

world. But with this influence comes the risk of amplifying misinformation and
deepening social divides-especially on consequential topics like public health
where factual accuracy directly impacts well-being. Scalable Oversight aims to
ensure AI truthfulness by enabling humans to supervise systems that may exceed
human capabilities--yet humans themselves hold different beliefs and biases
that impair their judgment. We study whether AI debate can guide biased judges
toward the truth by having two AI systems debate opposing sides of
controversial COVID-19 factuality claims where people hold strong prior
beliefs. We conduct two studies: one with human judges holding either
mainstream or skeptical beliefs evaluating factuality claims through
AI-assisted debate or consultancy protocols, and a second examining the same
problem with personalized AI judges designed to mimic these different human
belief systems. In our human study, we find that debate-where two AI advisor
systems present opposing evidence-based arguments-consistently improves
judgment accuracy and confidence calibration, outperforming consultancy with a
single-advisor system by 10% overall. The improvement is most significant for
judges with mainstream beliefs (+15.2% accuracy), though debate also helps
skeptical judges who initially misjudge claims move toward accurate views
(+4.7% accuracy). In our AI judge study, we find that AI judges with human-like
personas achieve even higher accuracy (78.5%) than human judges (70.1%) and
default AI judges without personas (69.8%), suggesting their potential for
supervising frontier AI models. These findings highlight AI debate as a
promising path toward scalable, bias-resilient oversight--leveraging both
diverse human and AI judgments to move closer to truth in contested domains.

*Dennis Fucci,Marco Gaido,Matteo Negri,Mauro Cettolo,Luisa Bentivogli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过特征归因技术分析了现代Conformer-based ASR系统依赖的声学线索，发现模型对元音、摩擦音和爆破音的声学特性有不同偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ASR技术取得显著进展，但模型依赖的具体声学线索尚不明确，且以往研究仅限于有限音素和过时模型。

Method: 应用特征归因技术分析现代Conformer-based ASR系统，评估其在时间和频率域中对元音、摩擦音和爆破音的声学特性依赖。

Result: 模型依赖元音的完整时间跨度（尤其是前两个共振峰，男性语音更显著），更关注摩擦音的频谱特性（尤其是嘶音），并优先处理爆破音的释放阶段（特别是爆破特性）。

Conclusion: 研究提升了ASR模型的可解释性，并指出了未来研究的方向，以揭示模型鲁棒性中的潜在不足。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in ASR, the specific acoustic cues models rely
on remain unclear. Prior studies have examined such cues on a limited set of
phonemes and outdated models. In this work, we apply a feature attribution
technique to identify the relevant acoustic cues for a modern Conformer-based
ASR system. By analyzing plosives, fricatives, and vowels, we assess how
feature attributions align with their acoustic properties in the time and
frequency domains, also essential for human speech perception. Our findings
show that the ASR model relies on vowels' full time spans, particularly their
first two formants, with greater saliency in male speech. It also better
captures the spectral characteristics of sibilant fricatives than non-sibilants
and prioritizes the release phase in plosives, especially burst
characteristics. These insights enhance the interpretability of ASR models and
highlight areas for future research to uncover potential gaps in model
robustness.

*Lindia Tjuatja,Graham Neubig*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为BehaviorBox的自动比较语言模型的方法，通过性能感知的上下文嵌入找到模型间的细粒度差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型评估复杂且模糊，传统方法（如困惑度）难以捕捉模型间的具体差异，需要一种自动化方法揭示模型在特定上下文中的表现差异。

Method: 使用BehaviorBox，基于性能感知的上下文嵌入，提取细粒度特征（如特定短语或标点使用），展示模型间的生成难度差异。

Result: BehaviorBox成功识别了模型在特定上下文中的表现差异（如条件句或情感表达），揭示了传统指标无法捕捉的细节。

Conclusion: BehaviorBox为语言模型比较提供了自动化、细粒度的分析工具，弥补了传统评估方法的不足。

Abstract: Language model evaluation is a daunting task: prompts are brittle,
corpus-level perplexities are vague, and the choice of benchmarks are endless.
Finding examples that show meaningful, generalizable differences between two
LMs is crucial to understanding where one model succeeds and another fails. Can
this process be done automatically? In this work, we propose methodology for
automated comparison of language models that uses performance-aware contextual
embeddings to find fine-grained features of text where one LM outperforms
another. Our method, which we name BehaviorBox, extracts coherent features that
demonstrate differences with respect to the ease of generation between two LMs.
Specifically, BehaviorBox finds features that describe groups of words in
fine-grained contexts, such as "conditional 'were' in the phrase 'if you were'"
and "exclamation marks after emotional statements", where one model outperforms
another within a particular datatset. We apply BehaviorBox to compare models
that vary in size, model family, and post-training, and enumerate insights into
specific contexts that illustrate meaningful differences in performance which
cannot be found by measures such as corpus-level perplexity alone.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于预训练语言模型的词信息量方法，用于识别语音中情感相关的关键片段，从而提高情感识别的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在计算语音特征时可能忽略细粒度变化，而通过识别语义重要片段可以更精准地捕捉情感信息。

Method: 利用预训练语言模型提取词信息量，选择关键片段，并计算其声学特征，结合标准声学特征和自监督表示。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于词信息量选择的片段显著提升了情感识别的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过聚焦语义重要片段，有效提高了情感识别的准确性。

Abstract: In emotion recognition from speech, a key challenge lies in identifying
speech signal segments that carry the most relevant acoustic variations for
discerning specific emotions. Traditional approaches compute functionals for
features such as energy and F0 over entire sentences or longer speech portions,
potentially missing essential fine-grained variation in the long-form
statistics. This research investigates the use of word informativeness, derived
from a pre-trained language model, to identify semantically important segments.
Acoustic features are then computed exclusively for these identified segments,
enhancing emotion recognition accuracy. The methodology utilizes standard
acoustic prosodic features, their functionals, and self-supervised
representations. Results indicate a notable improvement in recognition
performance when features are computed on segments selected based on word
informativeness, underscoring the effectiveness of this approach.

TL;DR: CoDial框架通过结构化异构图将专家知识转化为可执行的对话逻辑，支持非技术专家轻松定义和优化任务导向对话系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决专业领域对话系统开发中专家知识、训练数据和技术难度高的挑战。

Method: 提出CoDial框架，利用结构化异构图表示专家知识，并将其转换为可执行的对话逻辑。

Result: 在STAR数据集上达到最先进性能，在MultiWOZ数据集上与基线模型竞争。

Conclusion: CoDial是一个实用工具，支持专家通过反馈迭代优化LLM在高风险领域的对齐。

Abstract: It is often challenging to teach specialized, unseen tasks to dialogue
systems due to the high cost of expert knowledge, training data, and high
technical difficulty. To support domain-specific applications - such as law,
medicine, or finance - it is essential to build frameworks that enable
non-technical experts to define, test, and refine system behaviour with minimal
effort. Achieving this requires cross-disciplinary collaboration between
developers and domain specialists. In this work, we introduce a novel
framework, CoDial (Code for Dialogue), that converts expert knowledge,
represented as a novel structured heterogeneous graph, into executable
conversation logic. CoDial can be easily implemented in existing guardrailing
languages, such as Colang, to enable interpretable, modifiable, and true
zero-shot specification of task-oriented dialogue systems. Empirically, CoDial
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the STAR dataset for inference-based
models and is competitive with similar baselines on the well-known MultiWOZ
dataset. We also demonstrate CoDial's iterative improvement via manual and
LLM-aided feedback, making it a practical tool for expert-guided alignment of
LLMs in high-stakes domains.

*Wenzheng Zhang,Xi Victoria Lin,Karl Stratos,Wen-tau Yih,Mingda Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ImpRAG提出了一种无需显式查询的检索增强生成系统，通过统一检索和生成任务，显著提升了模型在多样化任务上的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统将检索和生成视为独立过程，限制了模型在多样化任务中的泛化能力。ImpRAG旨在消除显式查询的需求，实现检索与生成的无缝集成。

Method: ImpRAG将预训练的解码器语言模型分为专用层组，同时优化检索和生成任务。采用两阶段推理过程，共享模型参数和前向传播。

Result: 在8个知识密集型任务上，ImpRAG在未见任务上的精确匹配分数提升了3.6-11.5，展示了其强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: ImpRAG通过平衡检索与生成参数，并利用生成困惑度作为检索训练目标，显著提升了性能，为RAG系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems traditionally treat retrieval
and generation as separate processes, requiring explicit textual queries to
connect them. This separation can limit the ability of models to generalize
across diverse tasks. In this work, we propose a query-free RAG system, named
ImpRAG, which integrates retrieval and generation into a unified model. ImpRAG
allows models to implicitly express their information needs, eliminating the
need for human-specified queries. By dividing pretrained decoder-only language
models into specialized layer groups, ImpRAG optimizes retrieval and generation
tasks simultaneously. Our approach employs a two-stage inference process, using
the same model parameters and forward pass for both retrieval and generation,
thereby minimizing the disparity between retrievers and language models.
Experiments on 8 knowledge-intensive tasks demonstrate that ImpRAG achieves
3.6-11.5 improvements in exact match scores on unseen tasks with diverse
formats, highlighting its effectiveness in enabling models to articulate their
own information needs and generalize across tasks. Our analysis underscores the
importance of balancing retrieval and generation parameters and leveraging
generation perplexities as retrieval training objectives for enhanced
performance.

TL;DR: 研究通过分析网球赛后采访的韵律特征和自我监督学习（SSL）表示，探索仅凭采访录音分类比赛胜负的潜力。结果表明，SSL能有效区分胜负，而韵律特征（如音高变化）也是胜利的强指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索赛后采访中韵律特征与比赛结果的关系，并验证SSL模型在此任务中的有效性。

Method: 提取传统声学特征和深度语音表示（如Wav2Vec 2.0和HuBERT），使用机器学习分类器区分胜负。

Result: SSL表示能有效区分胜负，韵律特征（如音高变化）也是胜利的强指标。

Conclusion: SSL和韵律特征结合可用于赛后胜负分类，捕捉与情绪相关的细微语音模式。

Abstract: This study examines the prosodic characteristics associated with winning and
losing in post-match tennis interviews. Additionally, this research explores
the potential to classify match outcomes solely based on post-match interview
recordings using prosodic features and self-supervised learning (SSL)
representations. By analyzing prosodic elements such as pitch and intensity,
alongside SSL models like Wav2Vec 2.0 and HuBERT, the aim is to determine
whether an athlete has won or lost their match. Traditional acoustic features
and deep speech representations are extracted from the data, and machine
learning classifiers are employed to distinguish between winning and losing
players. Results indicate that SSL representations effectively differentiate
between winning and losing outcomes, capturing subtle speech patterns linked to
emotional states. At the same time, prosodic cues -- such as pitch variability
-- remain strong indicators of victory.

Result: 在ToolBench和CRMArena基准测试中，性能提升高达49.3%。

Conclusion: LAM SIMULATOR高效且有效，减少了人工干预，加速了AI代理的开发。

Abstract: Large Action Models (LAMs) for AI Agents offer incredible potential but face
challenges due to the need for high-quality training data, especially for
multi-steps tasks that involve planning, executing tool calls, and responding
to feedback. To address these issues, we present LAM SIMULATOR, a comprehensive
framework designed for online exploration of agentic tasks with high-quality
feedback. Our framework features a dynamic task query generator, an extensive
collection of tools, and an interactive environment where Large Language Model
(LLM) Agents can call tools and receive real-time feedback. This setup enables
LLM Agents to explore and solve tasks autonomously, facilitating the discovery
of multiple approaches to tackle any given task. The resulting action
trajectory data are then used to create high-quality training datasets for
LAMs. Our experiments on popular agentic benchmarks, ToolBench and CRMArena,
highlight the effectiveness of LAM SIMULATOR: models trained with
self-generated datasets using our framework achieve significant performance
gains, up to a 49.3\% improvement over their original baselines. LAM SIMULATOR
requires minimal human input during dataset creation, highlighting LAM
SIMULATOR's efficiency and effectiveness in speeding up development of AI
agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“语法提示”的方法，通过先解释语法规则再处理句子，显著提升了模型在判断句子可接受性时的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLM）能够解释语法规则，但在实际应用这些规则判断句子可接受性时表现不佳。

Method: 采用“解释-处理”范式：先由大语言模型生成语法现象的简明解释，再将解释作为额外上下文输入目标模型（LLM或小语言模型SLM），以判断句子对错。

Result: 在多个语言基准测试中，该方法显著提升了性能，缩小了LLM与SLM之间的准确率差距。

Conclusion: 语法提示是一种轻量级、语言无关的方法，能有效帮助低成本SLM接近前沿LLM的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can explain grammatical rules, yet they often
fail to apply those rules when judging sentence acceptability. We present
"grammar prompting", an explain-then-process paradigm: a large LLM first
produces a concise explanation of the relevant syntactic phenomenon, then that
explanation is fed back as additional context to the target model -- either an
LLM or a smaller language model (SLM) -- before deciding which sentence of a
minimal pair is grammatical. On the English BLiMP, Chinese SLING, and Russian
RuBLiMP benchmarks, this simple prompt design yields substantial improvements
over strong baselines across many syntactic phenomena. Feeding an LLM's
metalinguistic explanation back to the target model bridges the gap between
knowing a rule and using it. On SLMs, grammar prompting alone trims the average
LLM-SLM accuracy gap by about 20%, and when paired with chain-of-thought, by
56% (13.0 pp -> 5.8 pp), all at negligible cost. The lightweight,
language-agnostic cue lets low-cost SLMs approach frontier-LLM performance in
multilingual settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种衡量作者归属误判不公平性的指标MAUIk，并发现现有模型普遍存在不公平性，且与作者在潜在空间中的嵌入位置相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者归属误判在现实中可能带来严重后果，尤其是法医场景下，现有评估方法未考虑公平性问题。

Method: 引入Misattribution Unfairness Index (MAUIk)指标，量化五种模型在两个数据集上的不公平性，并分析作者在潜在空间中的嵌入位置与误判风险的关系。

Result: 所有模型均表现出高度不公平性，且误判风险与作者在潜在空间中的位置（如靠近中心）相关。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了作者归属误判的潜在危害，建议在模型构建和使用中需与终端用户沟通并校准误判风险。

Abstract: Authorship misattribution can have profound consequences in real life. In
forensic settings simply being considered as one of the potential authors of an
evidential piece of text or communication can result in undesirable scrutiny.
This raises a fairness question: Is every author in the candidate pool at equal
risk of misattribution? Standard evaluation measures for authorship attribution
systems do not explicitly account for this notion of fairness. We introduce a
simple measure, Misattribution Unfairness Index (MAUIk), which is based on how
often authors are ranked in the top k for texts they did not write. Using this
measure we quantify the unfairness of five models on two different datasets.
All models exhibit high levels of unfairness with increased risks for some
authors. Furthermore, we find that this unfairness relates to how the models
embed the authors as vectors in the latent search space. In particular, we
observe that the risk of misattribution is higher for authors closer to the
centroid (or center) of the embedded authors in the haystack. These results
indicate the potential for harm and the need for communicating with and
calibrating end users on misattribution risk when building and providing such
models for downstream use.

TL;DR: TRuST数据集整合现有数据，标注毒性、目标群体和毒性片段，用于改进毒性检测。研究发现微调模型优于零/少样本提示，但某些群体表现仍不佳，且推理能力对性能提升有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线内容（包括语言模型生成内容）的毒性问题因其心理和社会负面影响日益严重，需改进毒性检测方法。

Method: 整合现有数据集构建TRuST，标注毒性、目标群体和毒性片段，并评估大型语言模型在毒性检测、目标群体识别和毒性片段提取上的表现。

Result: 微调模型表现优于零/少样本提示，但对某些群体效果仍差；推理能力对性能提升不明显。

Conclusion: LLMs在社会推理能力上较弱，需进一步改进模型以提升毒性检测效果。

Abstract: Toxicity in online content, including content generated by language models,
has become a critical concern due to its potential for negative psychological
and social impact. This paper introduces TRuST, a comprehensive dataset
designed to improve toxicity detection that merges existing datasets, and has
labels for toxicity, target social group, and toxic spans. It includes a
diverse range of target groups such as ethnicity, gender, religion, disability,
and politics, with both human/machine-annotated and human machine-generated
data. We benchmark state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on toxicity
detection, target group identification, and toxic span extraction. We find that
fine-tuned models consistently outperform zero-shot and few-shot prompting,
though performance remains low for certain social groups. Further, reasoning
capabilities do not significantly improve performance, indicating that LLMs
have weak social reasoning skills.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种独立构建长链推理数据集的方法，通过短链推理LLM生成高质量的长链推理数据，减少对现有大型推理模型（如R1）的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究依赖大型推理模型（如R1）生成长链推理数据，限制了领域发展。本文旨在探索如何独立构建长链推理数据集。

Method: 利用短链推理LLM生成100K长链推理数据集（Long CoT Collection），并通过管道技术引入新推理策略，控制思维预算。

Result: 数据集质量接近R1，训练后的模型不仅提升通用推理能力，还为强化学习提供强基础（RLVR增益提升2-3倍）。

Conclusion: 独立构建长链推理数据集可行，为领域发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: With the release of R1, a publicly available large reasoning model (LRM),
researchers commonly train new LRMs by training language models on R1's long
chain-of-thought (CoT) inferences. While prior works show that LRMs'
capabilities can be reproduced through direct distillation, the continued
reliance on the existing models (e.g., R1) remains a critical limitation in
advancing the field. As a first step toward independent LRM development, this
paper explores the possibility of constructing a long CoT dataset with LLMs
that are not trained for inference-time scaling. To this end, we present the
Long CoT Collection, a dataset of 100K CoT rationales annotated using existing
short CoT LLMs. We develop a pipeline that induces o1's novel reasoning
strategies into short CoT LLMs, enabling them to think longer and introducing
controllability over the thought budget to better manage the overthinking
problem. Our extensive analyses validate that our dataset achieves quality
comparable to--or slightly below--R1. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate
that training on our dataset not only strengthens general reasoning skills, but
also provides a strong foundation for reinforcement learning--models
initialized on our data achieve 2-3x larger gains with RLVR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动故事生成方法在叙事连贯性和逻辑一致性上表现不足，影响故事体验，亟需改进。

Method: 引入基于SV0三元组的剧情节点结构，结合动态模块STORYLINE和NEKG，持续优化生成过程。

Result: 实验显示Storyteller在人类偏好评估中平均胜率达84.33%，且在创意、连贯性等方面领先。

Conclusion: Storyteller通过创新方法显著提升故事生成质量，为AI叙事领域带来突破。

Abstract: Stories are central to human culture, serving to share ideas, preserve
traditions, and foster connections. Automatic story generation, a key
advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), offers new possibilities for
creating personalized content, exploring creative ideas, and enhancing
interactive experiences. However, existing methods struggle to maintain
narrative coherence and logical consistency. This disconnect compromises the
overall storytelling experience, underscoring the need for substantial
improvements. Inspired by human cognitive processes, we introduce Storyteller,
a novel approach that systemically improves the coherence and consistency of
automatically generated stories. Storyteller introduces a plot node structure
based on linguistically grounded subject verb object (SVO) triplets, which
capture essential story events and ensure a consistent logical flow. Unlike
previous methods, Storyteller integrates two dynamic modules, the STORYLINE and
narrative entity knowledge graph (NEKG),that continuously interact with the
story generation process. This integration produces structurally sound,
cohesive and immersive narratives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Storyteller significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an 84.33%
average win rate through human preference evaluation. At the same time, it is
also far ahead in other aspects including creativity, coherence, engagement,
and relevance.

TL;DR: 论文提出TruthOverTricks评估范式，揭示现有虚假信息检测模型依赖表面线索的问题，并提出SMF数据增强框架以提升鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚假信息检测模型常依赖训练数据中的表面线索（捷径），难以泛化到真实场景，尤其是大型语言模型（LLM）生成的虚假信息。

Method: TruthOverTricks将捷径行为分类为内在诱导和外在注入，评估7种检测器在14个基准和2个新数据集上的表现，并提出SMF框架（基于LLM的数据增强）。

Result: 现有检测器在自然和对抗性捷径下性能显著下降，SMF通过语义增强在16个基准上提升鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SMF有效减少对捷径的依赖，推动虚假信息检测器的发展，相关资源已开源。

Abstract: Misinformation detection models often rely on superficial cues (i.e.,
\emph{shortcuts}) that correlate with misinformation in training data but fail
to generalize to the diverse and evolving nature of real-world misinformation.
This issue is exacerbated by large language models (LLMs), which can easily
generate convincing misinformation through simple prompts. We introduce
TruthOverTricks, a unified evaluation paradigm for measuring shortcut learning
in misinformation detection. TruthOverTricks categorizes shortcut behaviors
into intrinsic shortcut induction and extrinsic shortcut injection, and
evaluates seven representative detectors across 14 popular benchmarks, along
with two new factual misinformation datasets, NQ-Misinfo and Streaming-Misinfo.
Empirical results reveal that existing detectors suffer severe performance
degradation when exposed to both naturally occurring and adversarially crafted
shortcuts. To address this, we propose SMF, an LLM-augmented data augmentation
framework that mitigates shortcut reliance through paraphrasing, factual
summarization, and sentiment normalization. SMF consistently enhances
robustness across 16 benchmarks, encouraging models to rely on deeper semantic
understanding rather than shortcut cues. To promote the development of
misinformation detectors, we have published the resources publicly at
https://github.com/whr000001/TruthOverTricks.

reasoning. DIAMOND leverages sabermetric features -- Win Expectancy, WPA, and
Leverage Index -- to quantify play importance, while an LLM module enhances
selection based on contextual narrative value. This hybrid approach ensures
both quantitative rigor and qualitative richness, surpassing the limitations of
purely statistical or vision-based systems. Evaluated on five diverse Korean
Baseball Organization League games, DIAMOND improves F1-score from 42.9%
(WPA-only) to 84.8%, outperforming both commercial and statistical baselines.
Though limited in scale, our results highlight the potential of modular,
interpretable agent-based frameworks for event-level summarization in sports
and beyond.

Motivation: 解决日本LLM输出中的安全性和适当性问题，适应日本的社会文化背景。

Method: 创建包含1800对问题和参考答案的数据集，覆盖多种风险类别，用于微调日本LLM。

Result: 微调后LLM输出安全性提升，通用回答实用性未受影响；评估了12个日本LLM的安全性。

Conclusion: AnswerCarelessly数据集有效提升日本LLM安全性，支持多语言扩展，为其他地区提供参考。

Abstract: In this paper we present AnswerCarefully, a dataset for promoting the safety
and appropriateness of Japanese LLM outputs. The dataset consists of 1,800
pairs of questions and reference answers, where the questions require special
attention in answering. It covers a wide range of risk categories established
in prior English-language datasets, but the data samples are original in that
they are manually created to reflect the socio-cultural context of LLM usage in
Japan. We show that using this dataset for instruction to fine-tune a Japanese
LLM led to improved output safety without compromising the utility of general
responses. We also report the results of a safety evaluation of 12 Japanese
LLMs using this dataset as a benchmark. Finally, we describe the latest update
on the dataset which provides English translations and annotations of the
questions, aimed at facilitating the derivation of similar datasets in
different languages and regions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种扩展X-ICL的框架X²-ICL，通过系统探索所有可能标签的解释，提升大语言模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICL方法在分布外数据上泛化能力不足，X-ICL通过引入解释提升了可靠性，但仍需进一步改进。

Method: 扩展X-ICL，系统探索所有可能标签的解释（X²-ICL），以更全面和鲁棒的方式指导模型决策。

Result: 在多个自然语言理解数据集上验证，X²-ICL显著提升了分布外数据的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: X²-ICL通过全面探索标签解释，显著提升了模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a successful paradigm for leveraging
large language models (LLMs). However, it often struggles to generalize beyond
the distribution of the provided demonstrations. A recent advancement in
enhancing robustness is ICL with explanations (X-ICL), which improves
prediction reliability by guiding LLMs to understand and articulate the
reasoning behind correct labels. Building on this approach, we introduce an
advanced framework that extends X-ICL by systematically exploring explanations
for all possible labels (X$^2$-ICL), thereby enabling more comprehensive and
robust decision-making. Experimental results on multiple natural language
understanding datasets validate the effectiveness of X$^2$-ICL, demonstrating
significantly improved robustness to out-of-distribution data compared to the
existing ICL approaches.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Consultant Decoding (CD)的新机制，通过改进验证方法显著提升了大型语言模型推理速度，同时保持了生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Speculative Decoding (SD)的高拒绝率导致效率低下，需要改进验证机制以提升整体性能。

Method: CD采用基于LLM计算的token级似然性验证候选草案，而非SD的重要性采样指标。

Result: CD实现了2.5倍的推理速度提升，生成质量接近目标模型，且大模型调用频率降至10%以下。

Conclusion: CD不仅超越SD的性能上限，还在高要求任务中表现优异，展示了其高效性和实用性。

Abstract: The synergistic mechanism based on Speculative Decoding (SD) has garnered
considerable attention as a simple yet effective approach for accelerating the
inference of large language models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the high rejection
rates require repeated LLMs calls to validate draft tokens, undermining the
overall efficiency gain of SD. In this work, we revisit existing verification
mechanisms and propose a novel synergetic mechanism Consultant Decoding (CD).
Unlike SD, which relies on a metric derived from importance sampling for
verification, CD verifies candidate drafts using token-level likelihoods
computed solely by the LLM. CD achieves up to a 2.5-fold increase in inference
speed compared to the target model, while maintaining comparable generation
quality (around 100% of the target model's performance). Interestingly, this is
achieved by combining models whose parameter sizes differ by two orders of
magnitude. In addition, CD reduces the call frequency of the large target model
to below 10%, particularly in more demanding tasks. CD's performance was even
found to surpass that of the large target model, which theoretically represents
the upper bound for speculative decoding.

Motivation: 当前GraphRAG模型的评估主要依赖传统问答数据集，其问题和评估指标范围有限，无法全面评估GraphRAG在推理能力上的改进。

Method: 提出了GraphRAG-Bench，包含具有挑战性的问题设计、多样化的任务覆盖和全面的评估框架，用于测试GraphRAG模型的性能。

Conclusion: GraphRAG-Bench为研究社区提供了实用的评估工具和指导，有助于推动GraphRAG模型的进一步发展。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has garnered increasing
recognition for its potential to enhance large language models (LLMs) by
structurally organizing domain-specific corpora and facilitating complex
reasoning. However, current evaluations of GraphRAG models predominantly rely
on traditional question-answering datasets. Their limited scope in questions
and evaluation metrics fails to comprehensively assess the reasoning capacity
improvements enabled by GraphRAG models. To address this gap, we introduce
GraphRAG-Bench, a large-scale, domain-specific benchmark designed to rigorously
evaluate GraphRAG models. Our benchmark offers three key superiorities: \((i)\)
Challenging question design. Featuring college-level, domain-specific questions
that demand multi-hop reasoning, the benchmark ensures that simple content
retrieval is insufficient for problem-solving. For example, some questions
require mathematical reasoning or programming. \((ii)\) Diverse task coverage.
The dataset includes a broad spectrum of reasoning tasks, multiple-choice,
true/false, multi-select, open-ended, and fill-in-the-blank. It spans 16
disciplines in twenty core textbooks. \((iii)\) Holistic evaluation framework.
GraphRAG-Bench provides comprehensive assessment across the entire GraphRAG
pipeline, including graph construction, knowledge retrieval, and answer
generation. Beyond final-answer correctness, it evaluates the logical coherence
of the reasoning process. By applying nine contemporary GraphRAG methods to
GraphRAG-Bench, we demonstrate its utility in quantifying how graph-based
structuring improves model reasoning capabilities. Our analysis reveals
critical insights about graph architectures, retrieval efficacy, and reasoning
capabilities, offering actionable guidance for the research community.

through multilingual pre-training, task-specific tuning, and scaffolding
optimization. Empirical studies with elementary school students demonstrate
that SingaKids provides effective dialogic teaching, benefiting learners at
different performance levels.

Motivation: 探讨不同文化背景下英语教材中的性别不平等现象，填补跨文化研究的空白。

Method: 采用自然语言处理方法，包括字符计数、首次提及顺序、TF-IDF词关联、专有名词分析、大语言模型测试及GloVe嵌入分析。

Result: 所有地区均存在性别不平等，男性角色在数量、首次提及和命名实体上占优，拉丁文化圈差异最小。

Conclusion: 英语教材普遍存在性别不平等，需进一步推动性别平等教育。

Abstract: Textbooks play a critical role in shaping children's understanding of the
world. While previous studies have identified gender inequality in individual
countries' textbooks, few have examined the issue cross-culturally. This study
applies natural language processing methods to quantify gender inequality in
English textbooks from 22 countries across 7 cultural spheres. Metrics include
character count, firstness (which gender is mentioned first), and TF-IDF word
associations by gender. The analysis also identifies gender patterns in proper
names appearing in TF-IDF word lists, tests whether large language models can
distinguish between gendered word lists, and uses GloVe embeddings to examine
how closely keywords associate with each gender. Results show consistent
overrepresentation of male characters in terms of count, firstness, and named
entities. All regions exhibit gender inequality, with the Latin cultural sphere
showing the least disparity.

Conclusion: 为模块化、可泛化的LLM关系提取系统设计提供指导。

Abstract: Entity relationship classification remains a challenging task in information
extraction, especially in scenarios with limited labeled data and complex
relational structures. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of
three distinct AI agent architectures designed to perform relation
classification using large language models (LLMs). The agentic architectures
explored include (1) reflective self-evaluation, (2) hierarchical task
decomposition, and (3) a novel multi-agent dynamic example generation
mechanism, each leveraging different modes of reasoning and prompt adaptation.
In particular, our dynamic example generation approach introduces real-time
cooperative and adversarial prompting. We systematically compare their
performance across multiple domains and model backends. Our experiments
demonstrate that multi-agent coordination consistently outperforms standard
few-shot prompting and approaches the performance of fine-tuned models. These
findings offer practical guidance for the design of modular, generalizable
LLM-based systems for structured relation extraction. The source codes and

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在模拟不同国籍角色时是否表现出情感刻板印象，并分析其与文化规范的契合度。

Method: 通过情感归因分析预训练LLMs对不同国家的表现，并与人类情感反应对比。

Result: 发现LLMs在情感分配上存在显著国籍差异，尤其是负面情感，且与人类反应不一致。

Conclusion: LLMs输出中存在简化和潜在偏见的情感刻板印象，需进一步优化以减少偏差。

Abstract: Emotions are a fundamental facet of human experience, varying across
individuals, cultural contexts, and nationalities. Given the recent success of
Large Language Models (LLMs) as role-playing agents, we examine whether LLMs
exhibit emotional stereotypes when assigned nationality-specific personas.
Specifically, we investigate how different countries are represented in
pre-trained LLMs through emotion attributions and whether these attributions
align with cultural norms. Our analysis reveals significant nationality-based
differences, with emotions such as shame, fear, and joy being
disproportionately assigned across regions. Furthermore, we observe notable
misalignment between LLM-generated and human emotional responses, particularly
for negative emotions, highlighting the presence of reductive and potentially
biased stereotypes in LLM outputs.

Motivation: 研究LLM在长尾加密文本中的安全性行为，揭示其潜在风险，为开发更健壮的安全机制提供方向。

Method: 提出二维框架（指令拒绝和生成安全性），通过实验评估LLM在解密能力下的安全表现。

Result: 发现具备解密能力的模型可能因不匹配泛化攻击导致安全机制失效，产生不安全响应或过度拒绝。

Conclusion: 本文为理解LLM在长尾文本中的安全性提供了基础，并指出了开发更健壮安全机制的方向。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic evaluation of Large Language Models' (LLMs)
behavior on long-tail distributed (encrypted) texts and their safety
implications. We introduce a two-dimensional framework for assessing LLM
safety: (1) instruction refusal-the ability to reject harmful obfuscated
instructions, and (2) generation safety-the suppression of generating harmful
responses. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that models that
possess capabilities to decrypt ciphers may be susceptible to
mismatched-generalization attacks: their safety mechanisms fail on at least one
safety dimension, leading to unsafe responses or over-refusal. Based on these
findings, we evaluate a number of pre-LLM and post-LLM safeguards and discuss
their strengths and limitations. This work contributes to understanding the
safety of LLM in long-tail text scenarios and provides directions for
developing robust safety mechanisms.

crucial. However, the scarcity of high-quality data remains a fundamental
challenge to evaluating and improving this capability. Traditional dataset
construction methods are labor-intensive, resource-demanding, and raise privacy
concerns. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach for automatic
synthetic data generation and introduce the Implicit Personalized Dialogue
(IP-Dialog) benchmark along with a training dataset, covering 10 tasks and 12
user attribute types. Additionally, we develop a systematic evaluation
framework with four metrics to assess both attribute awareness and reasoning

Result: Multimodal DeepResearcher在Claude 3.7 Sonnet模型上实现了82%的胜率。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了多模态报告生成的挑战，并展示了显著优势。

Abstract: Visualizations play a crucial part in effective communication of concepts and
information. Recent advances in reasoning and retrieval augmented generation
have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform deep research and generate
comprehensive reports. Despite its progress, existing deep research frameworks
primarily focus on generating text-only content, leaving the automated
generation of interleaved texts and visualizations underexplored. This novel
task poses key challenges in designing informative visualizations and
effectively integrating them with text reports. To address these challenges, we
propose Formal Description of Visualization (FDV), a structured textual
representation of charts that enables LLMs to learn from and generate diverse,
high-quality visualizations. Building on this representation, we introduce
Multimodal DeepResearcher, an agentic framework that decomposes the task into
four stages: (1) researching, (2) exemplar report textualization, (3) planning,
and (4) multimodal report generation. For the evaluation of generated
multimodal reports, we develop MultimodalReportBench, which contains 100
diverse topics served as inputs along with 5 dedicated metrics. Extensive
experiments across models and evaluation methods demonstrate the effectiveness
of Multimodal DeepResearcher. Notably, utilizing the same Claude 3.7 Sonnet

TL;DR: MidPO提出了一种基于混合专家（MoE）框架的双偏好优化方法，旨在平衡大型语言模型（LLM）的安全性和有用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在各领域的广泛应用，如何在保持有用性的同时增强安全性成为关键挑战。现有方法在平衡两者时存在不足。

Method: MidPO通过单偏好优化训练独立的安全性和有用性专家，并利用MoE框架动态分配两者的贡献。

Result: 实验表明，MidPO在安全性和有用性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MidPO提供了一种有效平衡安全性和有用性的解决方案，代码和模型将开源。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied across various
domains, enhancing safety while maintaining the helpfulness of LLMs has become
a critical challenge. Recent studies solve this problem through
safety-constrained online preference optimization or safety-constrained offline
preference optimization. However, the safety-constrained online methods often
suffer from excessive safety, which might reduce helpfulness, while the
safety-constrained offline methods perform poorly in adaptively balancing
safety and helpfulness. To address these limitations, we propose MidPO, a
\textbf{\underline{Mi}}xture of Experts (MoE) framework for safety-helpfulness
\textbf{\underline{d}}ual \textbf{\underline{P}}reference
\textbf{\underline{O}}ptimization. Firstly, MidPO devises single-preference
enhanced direct preference optimization approach to transform the base model
into two independent experts, termed safety and helpfulness experts, and
fine-tunes the two independent experts for optimal safety or helpfulness
performance. Secondly, to achieve an effective balance between safety and
helpfulness, MidPO incorporates the two experts into the MoE framework and
designs a dynamic routing mechanism to allocate contributions from each expert
adaptively. We conduct quantitative and qualitative experiments on three
popular datasets to demonstrate the proposed MidPO significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in both safety and helpfulness. The code and models
will be released.

Motivation: 现有对LLMs的ToM评估主要局限于英语，忽略了语言多样性对人类认知的影响，因此需要研究LLMs是否具备多语言心智理论能力。

Method: 开发了XToM基准测试，涵盖五种语言和多样化的任务场景，并系统评估了LLMs（如DeepSeek R1）。

Result: LLMs在多语言理解上表现优异，但在不同语言中的ToM能力存在显著差异。

Conclusion: LLMs在多语言环境中模拟人类心智推理的能力存在局限性。

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to infer mental states in others, is
pivotal for human social cognition. Existing evaluations of ToM in LLMs are
largely limited to English, neglecting the linguistic diversity that shapes
human cognition. This limitation raises a critical question: can LLMs exhibit
Multilingual Theory of Mind, which is the capacity to reason about mental
states across diverse linguistic contexts? To address this gap, we present
XToM, a rigorously validated multilingual benchmark that evaluates ToM across
five languages and incorporates diverse, contextually rich task scenarios.
Using XToM, we systematically evaluate LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek R1), revealing a
pronounced dissonance: while models excel in multilingual language
understanding, their ToM performance varies across languages. Our findings
expose limitations in LLMs' ability to replicate human-like mentalizing across
linguistic contexts.

Result: FroM在多种微调场景中优于基线方法，显著缓解任务干扰。

Conclusion: FroM为模型合并提供了更高效且无需训练数据的解决方案，适用于多种微调场景。

Abstract: With the development of large language models, fine-tuning has emerged as an
effective method to enhance performance in specific scenarios by injecting
domain-specific knowledge. In this context, model merging techniques provide a
solution for fusing knowledge from multiple fine-tuning models by combining
their parameters. However, traditional methods often encounter task
interference when merging full fine-tuning models, and this problem becomes
even more evident in parameter-efficient fine-tuning scenarios. In this paper,
we introduce an improvement to the RegMean method, which indirectly leverages
the training data to approximate the outputs of the linear layers before and
after merging. We propose an adaptive merging method called FroM, which
directly measures the model parameters using the Frobenius norm, without any
training data. By introducing an additional hyperparameter for control, FroM
outperforms baseline methods across various fine-tuning scenarios, alleviating
the task interference problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法计算开销高或依赖模型优化能力，限制了广泛应用。ORPP旨在解决这些问题。

Method: ORPP通过在小样本上迭代优化生成高质量角色扮演提示，并利用模型的少样本学习能力扩展到其他样本。

Result: 实验表明ORPP性能优于主流方法，且具备出色的即插即用能力。

Conclusion: ORPP为提示优化提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: High-quality prompts are crucial for eliciting outstanding performance from
large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. Existing research has explored
model-driven strategies for prompt optimization. However, these methods often
suffer from high computational overhead or require strong optimization
capabilities from the model itself, which limits their broad applicability.To
address these challenges, we propose ORPP (Optimized Role-Playing Prompt),a
framework that enhances model performance by optimizing and generating
role-playing prompts. The core idea of ORPP is to confine the prompt search
space to role-playing scenarios, thereby fully activating the model's intrinsic
capabilities through carefully crafted, high-quality role-playing prompts.
Specifically, ORPP first performs iterative optimization on a small subset of
training samples to generate high-quality role-playing prompts. Then,
leveraging the model's few-shot learning capability, it transfers the
optimization experience to efficiently generate suitable prompts for the
remaining samples.Our experimental results show that ORPP not only matches but
in most cases surpasses existing mainstream prompt optimization methods in
terms of performance. Notably, ORPP demonstrates superior "plug-and-play"
capability. In most cases, it can be integrated with various other prompt
methods and further enhance their effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索短形式测试与长形式输出中价值观偏好是否一致，填补实际应用中价值观相关风险的空白。

Method: 比较五种LLM在短形式反应和长形式响应中的价值观偏好，分析不同参数设置的影响。

Result: 短形式与长形式偏好相关性弱；长形式生成设置间相关性也弱；对齐对一致性提升有限。

Conclusion: 需更稳健方法确保价值观表达在不同应用中的一致性。

Abstract: Evaluations of LLMs' ethical risks and value inclinations often rely on
short-form surveys and psychometric tests, yet real-world use involves
long-form, open-ended responses -- leaving value-related risks and preferences
in practical settings largely underexplored. In this work, we ask: Do value
preferences inferred from short-form tests align with those expressed in
long-form outputs? To address this question, we compare value preferences
elicited from short-form reactions and long-form responses, varying the number
of arguments in the latter to capture users' differing verbosity preferences.
Analyzing five LLMs (llama3-8b, gemma2-9b, mistral-7b, qwen2-7b, and olmo-7b),
we find (1) a weak correlation between value preferences inferred from
short-form and long-form responses across varying argument counts, and (2)
similarly weak correlation between preferences derived from any two distinct
long-form generation settings. (3) Alignment yields only modest gains in the
consistency of value expression. Further, we examine how long-form generation
attributes relate to value preferences, finding that argument specificity
negatively correlates with preference strength, while representation across
scenarios shows a positive correlation. Our findings underscore the need for

TL;DR: NSAR结合神经与符号推理，提升多目标推理能力，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在长文本中多目标推理的困难。

Method: 通过提取符号事实并生成Python代码，结合神经与符号推理。

Result: 在七种语言和不同上下文长度中表现优异。

Conclusion: 神经与符号推理结合在多语言场景中效果显著。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to perform multi-target reasoning
in long-context scenarios where relevant information is scattered across
extensive documents. To address this challenge, we introduce NeuroSymbolic
Augmented Reasoning (NSAR), which combines the benefits of neural and symbolic
reasoning during inference. NSAR explicitly extracts symbolic facts from text
and generates executable Python code to handle complex reasoning steps. Through
extensive experiments across seven languages and diverse context lengths, we
demonstrate that NSAR significantly outperforms both a vanilla RAG baseline and
advanced prompting strategies in accurately identifying and synthesizing
multiple pieces of information. Our results highlight the effectiveness of
combining explicit symbolic operations with neural inference for robust,
interpretable, and scalable reasoning in multilingual settings.

Motivation: 现有研究忽视文本到图像（T2I）生成任务的评估能力开发及大规模人类评估数据的整合。

Method: 提出Minos-Corpus数据集，结合人类和GPT数据；采用数据选择与平衡、Mix-SFT训练方法及DPO技术，基于7B模型开发Minos评估模型。

Result: Minos在类似规模的开源评估模型中表现最优，并在T2I任务评估中超越所有开源和闭源模型。

Conclusion: 高质量人类评估数据及联合训练I2T和T2I任务数据对提升评估性能至关重要。

Abstract: Evaluation is important for multimodal generation tasks. With the rapid
progress of MLLMs, there is growing interest in applying MLLMs to build general
evaluation systems. However, existing work overlooks two aspects: (1) the
development of evaluation capabilities for text-to-image (T2I) generation task,
and (2) the incorporation of large-scale human evaluation data. In this paper,
we introduce Minos-Corpus, a large-scale multimodal evaluation dataset that
combines evaluation data from both human and GPT. The corpus contains
evaluation data across both image-to-text(I2T) and T2I generation tasks. Based
on this corpus, we propose Data Selection and Balance, Mix-SFT training
methods, and apply DPO to develop Minos, a multimodal evaluation model built
upon a 7B backbone. Minos achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance among
all open-source evaluation models of similar scale on the average of evaluation
performance on all tasks, and outperforms all open-source and closed-source
models on evaluation of T2I generation task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the importance of leveraging high-quality human evaluation data and jointly
training on evaluation data from both I2T and T2I generation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RAG使LLMs能够访问更广泛的知识源，但检索文档中的噪声仍导致事实不一致，需要改进生成模型处理噪声内容的能力。

Method: 提出KARE-RAG，包含结构化知识表示、DDPO训练目标和对比数据生成管道三项创新。

Result: 实验表明，KARE-RAG显著提升了标准RAG管道的性能，且数据效率高。

Conclusion: 通过优化模型处理检索内容的方式，可以提升RAG在多样化推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to
access broader knowledge sources, yet factual inconsistencies persist due to
noise in retrieved documents-even with advanced retrieval methods. We
demonstrate that enhancing generative models' capacity to process noisy content
is equally critical for robust performance. In this paper, we present KARE-RAG
(Knowledge-Aware Refinement and Enhancement for RAG), which improves knowledge
utilization through three key innovations: (1) structured knowledge
representations that facilitate error detection during training, (2) Dense
Direct Preference Optimization (DDPO)-a refined training objective that
prioritizes correction of critical errors, and (3) a contrastive data
generation pipeline that maintains semantic consistency while rectifying
factual inaccuracies. Experiments show our method significantly enhances
standard RAG pipelines across model scales, improving both in-domain and
out-of-domain task performance without compromising general capabilities.
Notably, these gains are achieved with modest training data, suggesting
data-efficient optimization is possible through targeted learning strategies.
Our findings establish a new direction for RAG improvement: by improving how
models learn to process retrieved content, we can enhance performance across
diverse inference paradigms. All data and code will be publicly available on
Github.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为$	exttt{M$^3$FinMeeting}$的新基准，用于评估大语言模型在金融会议理解中的表现。该基准支持多语言、多行业和多任务，实验表明现有模型仍有改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前金融领域的基准多基于新闻或财报，难以捕捉金融会议的真实动态，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 提出$	exttt{M$^3$FinMeeting}$数据集，支持英语、中文和日语，涵盖多个行业，并包括摘要、QA对提取和问答三项任务。

Result: 实验显示，即使是先进的长上下文模型在金融会议理解上仍有显著改进空间。

Conclusion: $	exttt{M$^3$FinMeeting}$是一个有效的基准，能够全面评估大语言模型在金融会议理解中的能力。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have led to the
development of new benchmarks for evaluating their performance in the financial
domain. However, current financial benchmarks often rely on news articles,
earnings reports, or announcements, making it challenging to capture the
real-world dynamics of financial meetings. To address this gap, we propose a
novel benchmark called $\texttt{M$^3$FinMeeting}$, which is a multilingual,
multi-sector, and multi-task dataset designed for financial meeting
understanding. First, $\texttt{M$^3$FinMeeting}$ supports English, Chinese, and
Japanese, enhancing comprehension of financial discussions in diverse
linguistic contexts. Second, it encompasses various industry sectors defined by
the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS), ensuring that the benchmark
spans a broad range of financial activities. Finally,
$\texttt{M$^3$FinMeeting}$ includes three tasks: summarization, question-answer
(QA) pair extraction, and question answering, facilitating a more realistic and
comprehensive evaluation of understanding. Experimental results with seven
popular LLMs reveal that even the most advanced long-context models have
significant room for improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of
$\texttt{M$^3$FinMeeting}$ as a benchmark for assessing LLMs' financial meeting
comprehension skills.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金融数据集（如FinQA和ConvFinQA）仅监督最终数值答案，缺乏对中间推理步骤的评估，因此需要FinChain来填补这一空白。

Method: FinChain包含54个主题和12个金融领域，每个主题提供五种参数化模板，支持自动生成训练数据。同时引入ChainEval指标，自动评估最终答案和中间推理。

Result: 测试30个大型语言模型后发现，即使是先进模型在多步金融推理上仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: FinChain为金融领域的多步推理提供了标准化评估工具，并展示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: Multi-step symbolic reasoning is critical for advancing downstream
performance on financial tasks. Yet, benchmarks for systematically evaluating
this capability are lacking. Existing datasets like FinQA and ConvFinQA
supervise only final numerical answers, without assessing intermediate
reasoning steps. To address this, we introduce FinChain, the first symbolic
benchmark designed for verifiable Chain-of- Thought (CoT) financial reasoning.
Spanning 54 topics across 12 financial domains, Fin- Chain offers five
parameterized templates per topic, each varying in reasoning complexity and
domain expertise required. Each dataset instance includes an executable Python
trace, enabling automatic generation of extensive training data and easy
adaptation to other domains. We also introduce ChainEval, a new metric for
automatic evaluation of both final answers and intermediate reasoning.
Benchmarking 30 LLMs on our dataset, we find that even state-of-the-art models
have considerable room for improvement in multi-step financial reasoning. All
templates and evaluation metrics for FinChain are available at https:

TL;DR: COLLATE框架通过多样化理性生成和偏好优化，提升小型LLM的推理能力，无需依赖大型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小型LLM因版权和法律问题无法依赖大型模型的问题，提升其独立推理能力。

Method: COLLATE通过生成多样化理性并优化选择，提升任务表现。

Result: 在多个领域的数据集上优于基线方法，适用于不同规模的LLM。

Conclusion: COLLATE为小型LLM提供了一种有效的独立推理能力提升方案。

Abstract: LLMssuch as GPT-4 have shown a remarkable ability to solve complex questions
by generating step-by-step rationales. Prior works have utilized this
capability to improve smaller and cheaper LMs (say, with 7B parameters).
However, various practical constraints, such as copyright and legal issues,
owing to lack of transparency in the pre-training data of large (often closed)
models, prevent their use in commercial settings. Little focus has been given
to improving the innate reasoning ability of smaller models without distilling
information from larger LLMs. To address this, we propose COLLATE, a trainable
framework that tunes a (small) LLM to generate those outputs from a pool of
diverse rationales that selectively improves the downstream task. COLLATE
enforces multiple instances of the same LLM to exhibit distinct behavior and
employs them to generate rationales to obtain diverse outputs. The LLM is then
tuned via preference optimization to choose the candidate rationale which
maximizes the likelihood of ground-truth answer. COLLATE outperforms several
trainable and prompting baselines on 5 datasets across 3 domains: maths problem
solving, natural language inference, and commonsense reasoning. We show the eff
icacy of COLLATE on LLMs from different model families across varying parameter
scales (1B to 8B) and demonstrate the benefit of multiple rationale providers
guided by the end task through ablations. Code is released here

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于加权采样的对比学习方法，用于优化多语言嵌入模型，以支持跨语言知识共享。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量知识库资源稀缺且语言有限，需要有效的嵌入模型将多语言句子转换为与知识库语言相同的特征向量空间，实现跨语言知识共享。

Method: 采用加权采样的对比学习方法微调多语言嵌入模型，支持单语知识库的多语言信息检索。

Result: 加权采样策略在MRR和Recall@3指标上分别提升31.03%和33.98%。

Conclusion: 该方法语言无关，适用于多语言和代码混合场景。

Abstract: Multilingual information retrieval has emerged as powerful tools for
expanding knowledge sharing across languages. On the other hand, resources on
high quality knowledge base are often scarce and in limited languages,
therefore an effective embedding model to transform sentences from different
languages into a feature vector space same as the knowledge base language
becomes the key ingredient for cross language knowledge sharing, especially to
transfer knowledge available in high-resource languages to low-resource ones.
In this paper we propose a novel strategy to fine-tune multilingual embedding
models with weighted sampling for contrastive learning, enabling multilingual
information retrieval with a monolingual knowledge base. We demonstrate that
the weighted sampling strategy produces performance gains compared to standard
ones by up to 31.03\% in MRR and up to 33.98\% in Recall@3. Additionally, our
proposed methodology is language agnostic and applicable for both multilingual
and code switching use cases.

formats being held digitally. To come to a decision, a careful discussion and
consideration of opinions and a civil exchange of arguments, which is defined
as the act of deliberation, is desirable. The quality of discussions and
participation processes in terms of their deliberativeness highly depends on
the design of platforms and processes. To facilitate online communication for
both participants and initiators, machine learning methods offer a lot of
potential. In this work we want to showcase which issues occur in political
online discussions and how machine learning can be used to counteract these
issues and enhance deliberation.

TL;DR: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in LLMs but is often verbose. The study finds that 60% of reasoning steps are redundant. Three strategies (early stopping, boosting end signals, and supervised stopping) reduce token usage without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CoT prompting increases inference cost due to redundant reasoning steps. The study aims to identify the minimum reasoning needed for stable decisions and improve efficiency.

Method: Systematic study to determine redundant reasoning steps, followed by three inference-time strategies: early stopping, boosting end signals, and supervised stopping based on internal activations.

Result: Experiments show significant token reduction (e.g., 40% on NaturalQuestions) with little or no accuracy drop across five benchmarks and five LLMs.

Conclusion: The study highlights cost-effective reasoning methods for real-world applications, demonstrating practical benefits of reducing redundant reasoning steps.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting enhances reasoning in large language models
(LLMs) but often leads to verbose and redundant outputs, thus increasing
inference cost. We hypothesize that many reasoning steps are unnecessary for
producing correct answers. To investigate this, we start with a systematic
study to examine what is the minimum reasoning required for a model to reach a
stable decision. We find that on math reasoning tasks like math, models
typically converge to their final answers after 60\% of the reasoning steps,
suggesting substantial redundancy in the remaining content. Based on these
insights, we propose three inference-time strategies to improve efficiency: (1)
early stopping via answer consistency, (2) boosting the probability of
generating end-of-reasoning signals, and (3) a supervised method that learns
when to stop based on internal activations. Experiments across five benchmarks
and five open-weights LLMs show that our methods significantly reduce token
usage with little or no accuracy drop. In particular, on NaturalQuestions,
Answer Consistency reduces tokens by over 40\% while further improving
accuracy. Our work underscores the importance of cost-effective reasoning
methods that operate at inference time, offering practical benefits for
real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态检索增强生成（MMRAG）存在参数化与检索知识不一致（PRKI）及视觉与文本知识不一致（VTKI）的问题，影响可靠性。

Method: 提出CoRe-MMRAG框架，通过四阶段流程（内部响应生成、多模态证据选择、外部响应生成、整合）和专门训练范式解决不一致问题。

Result: 在KB-VQA基准测试中，CoRe-MMRAG在InfoSeek和Encyclopedic-VQA上分别提升5.6%和9.3%。

Conclusion: CoRe-MMRAG有效解决多模态知识不一致问题，显著提升模型性能，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MMRAG) has been introduced to
enhance Multimodal Large Language Models by incorporating externally retrieved
multimodal knowledge, but it introduces two challenges: Parametric-Retrieved
Knowledge Inconsistency (PRKI), where discrepancies between parametric and
retrieved knowledge create uncertainty in determining reliability, and
Visual-Textual Knowledge Inconsistency (VTKI), where misalignment between
visual and textual sources disrupts entity representation. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{C}r\textbf{o}ss-source knowledge
\textbf{Re}conciliation for \textbf{M}ulti\textbf{M}odal \textbf{RAG}
(CoRe-MMRAG), a novel end-to-end framework that effectively reconciles
inconsistencies across knowledge sources. CoRe-MMRAG follows a four-stage
pipeline: it first generates an internal response from parametric knowledge,
then selects the most relevant multimodal evidence via joint similarity
assessment, generates an external response, and finally integrates both to
produce a reliable answer. Additionally, a specialized training paradigm
enhances knowledge source discrimination, multimodal integration, and unified
answer generation. Experiments on KB-VQA benchmarks show that CoRe-MMRAG
achieves substantial improvements over baseline methods, achieving 5.6\% and
9.3\% performance gains on InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA, respectively. We

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）需要大量计算资源，而现有剪枝方法通常关注保留通用能力，导致性能下降或需要后训练。

Method: 通过沿“语言”、“领域”和“任务”维度识别并剪枝无关神经元，生成专家模型。

Result: Cus-Prun在各种模型家族和尺寸上均优于其他方法，专家和通用能力损失最小。

Conclusion: Cus-Prun是一种高效剪枝方法，适用于生成轻量级专家模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet their substantial model sizes often require substantial computational
resources. To preserve computing resources and accelerate inference speed, it
is crucial to prune redundant parameters, especially for experienced users who
often need compact expert models tailored to specific downstream scenarios.
However, most existing pruning methods focus on preserving the model's general
capabilities, often requiring extensive post-training or suffering from
degraded performance due to coarse-grained pruning. In this work, we design a
$\underline{Cus}$tom $\underline{Prun}$ing method ($\texttt{Cus-Prun}$) to
prune a large general model into a smaller lightweight expert model, which is
positioned along the "language", "domain" and "task" dimensions. By identifying
and pruning irrelevant neurons of each dimension, $\texttt{Cus-Prun}$ creates
expert models without any post-training. Our experiments demonstrate that
$\texttt{Cus-Prun}$ consistently outperforms other methods, achieving minimal
loss in both expert and general capabilities across various models from
different model families and sizes.

Result: 现有印尼LLMs在非正式和本地语言环境中常生成不安全内容，而基于IndoSafety的微调显著提升安全性且不影响性能。

Conclusion: 强调文化背景安全评估的重要性，为多语言环境中负责任部署LLMs提供实践支持。

Abstract: Although region-specific large language models (LLMs) are increasingly
developed, their safety remains underexplored, particularly in culturally
diverse settings like Indonesia, where sensitivity to local norms is essential
and highly valued by the community. In this work, we present IndoSafety, the
first high-quality, human-verified safety evaluation dataset tailored for the
Indonesian context, covering five language varieties: formal and colloquial
Indonesian, along with three major local languages: Javanese, Sundanese, and
Minangkabau. IndoSafety is constructed by extending prior safety frameworks to
develop a taxonomy that captures Indonesia's sociocultural context. We find
that existing Indonesian-centric LLMs often generate unsafe outputs,
particularly in colloquial and local language settings, while fine-tuning on
IndoSafety significantly improves safety while preserving task performance. Our
work highlights the critical need for culturally grounded safety evaluation and
provides a concrete step toward responsible LLM deployment in multilingual
settings. Warning: This paper contains example data that may be offensive,

Motivation: 探索韵律（如语调、节奏和响度）在独立于词汇内容时对文本结构预测的贡献程度。

Method: 使用自监督学习（SSL）构建Masked Prosody Model，分析韵律的声学相关结构的时间粒度。

Result: SSL模型在涉及长期结构的任务（如情感识别）中表现最佳，优于传统特征（如音高、能量和语音活动）。

Conclusion: SSL训练目标的时间尺度及其编码的复杂结构对韵律分析至关重要，优于传统方法。

Abstract: People exploit the predictability of lexical structures during text
comprehension. Though predictable structure is also present in speech, the
degree to which prosody, e.g. intonation, tempo, and loudness, contributes to
such structure independently of the lexical content is unclear. This study
leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) to examine the temporal granularity of
structures in the acoustic correlates of prosody. Representations from our
proposed Masked Prosody Model can predict perceptual labels dependent on local
information, such as word boundaries, but provide the most value for labels
involving longer-term structures, like emotion recognition. Probing experiments
across various perceptual labels show strong relative gains over untransformed
pitch, energy, and voice activity features. Our results reveal the importance
of SSL training objective timescale and highlight the value of complex
SSL-encoded structures compared to more constrained classical structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能像人类一样在不同测量系统下提供准确信息，以适应多元文化用户需求。

Method: 通过新编译的数据集测试7个开源LLMs，研究其默认测量系统、性能差异及推理方法的效果。

Result: LLMs默认使用主流测量系统，性能不稳定，推理方法可部分改善但增加计算成本。

Conclusion: LLMs在多元测量系统下的表现仍需改进，推理方法虽有效但成本高，可能边缘化使用非主流系统的用户。

Abstract: Measurement systems (e.g., currencies) differ across cultures, but the
conversions between them are well defined so that humans can state facts using
any measurement system of their choice. Being available to users from diverse
cultural backgrounds, large language models (LLMs) should also be able to
provide accurate information irrespective of the measurement system at hand.
Using newly compiled datasets we test if this is the case for seven open-source
LLMs, addressing three key research questions: (RQ1) What is the default system
used by LLMs for each type of measurement? (RQ2) Do LLMs' answers and their
accuracy vary across different measurement systems? (RQ3) Can LLMs mitigate
potential challenges w.r.t. underrepresented systems via reasoning? Our
findings show that LLMs default to the measurement system predominantly used in
the data. Additionally, we observe considerable instability and variance in
performance across different measurement systems. While this instability can in
part be mitigated by employing reasoning methods such as chain-of-thought
(CoT), this implies longer responses and thereby significantly increases
test-time compute (and inference costs), marginalizing users from cultural

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法（DBG分数）来测量大型语言模型（LLMs）作为评判者时的自偏好偏差，通过引入黄金判断来消除响应质量对偏差测量的干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在测量LLMs的自偏好偏差时，混淆了偏差与响应质量的影响，导致结果不准确。

Method: 提出DBG分数，通过比较评判模型对自己响应和黄金判断的评分来测量自偏好偏差。

Result: 实验评估了不同版本、规模和推理能力的LLMs的自偏好偏差，并探讨了影响偏差的因素。

Conclusion: DBG分数有效解决了偏差测量的混淆问题，并揭示了自偏好偏差的潜在机制。

Abstract: Recent studies show that large language models (LLMs) exhibit self-preference
bias when serving as judges, meaning they tend to favor their own responses
over those generated by other models. Existing methods typically measure this
bias by calculating the difference between the scores a judge model assigns to
its own responses and those it assigns to responses from other models. However,
this approach conflates self-preference bias with response quality, as
higher-quality responses from the judge model may also lead to positive score
differences, even in the absence of bias. To address this issue, we introduce
gold judgments as proxies for the actual quality of responses and propose the
DBG score, which measures self-preference bias as the difference between the
scores assigned by the judge model to its own responses and the corresponding
gold judgments. Since gold judgments reflect true response quality, the DBG
score mitigates the confounding effect of response quality on bias measurement.
Using the DBG score, we conduct comprehensive experiments to assess
self-preference bias across LLMs of varying versions, sizes, and reasoning
abilities. Additionally, we investigate two factors that influence and help
alleviate self-preference bias: response text style and the post-training data
of judge models. Finally, we explore potential underlying mechanisms of
self-preference bias from an attention-based perspective. Our code and data are
available at https://github.com/zhiyuanc2001/self-preference.

*Fan Gao,Dongyuan Li,Ding Xia,Fei Mi,Yasheng Wang,Lifeng Shang,Baojun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个多体裁的中文写作基准\benchName，用于评估大型语言模型在四种主要体裁（议论文、记叙文、说明文和描写文）中的表现，并开发了细粒度的评分框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在中文写作评估中忽略了结构和修辞复杂性，且缺乏对不同体裁的针对性研究。

Method: 构建了包含728个真实提示的数据集，分为开放和约束两类，并设计了细粒度评分框架。通过人类一致性研究验证评估协议。

Result: 评估了15个大型语言模型，分析了它们在不同体裁和指令类型中的优缺点。

Conclusion: \benchName为中文写作评估提供了新基准，并启发了教育场景中改进作文生成的研究。

Abstract: Chinese essay writing and its evaluation are critical in educational
contexts, yet the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this domain
remain largely underexplored. Existing benchmarks often rely on coarse-grained
text quality metrics, largely overlooking the structural and rhetorical
complexities of Chinese essays, particularly across diverse genres. To address
this gap, we propose \benchName, a multi-genre benchmark specifically designed
for Chinese essay writing across four major genres: Argumentative, Narrative,
Descriptive, and Expository. We curate and refine a total of 728 real-world
prompts to ensure authenticity and meticulously categorize them into the
\textit{Open-Ended} and \textit{Constrained} sets to capture diverse writing
scenarios. To reliably evaluate generated essays, we develop a fine-grained,
genre-specific scoring framework that hierarchically aggregates scores. We
further validate our evaluation protocol through a comprehensive human
agreement study. Finally, we benchmark 15 large-sized LLMs, analyzing their
strengths and limitations across genres and instruction types. With \benchName,
we aim to advance LLM-based Chinese essay evaluation and inspire future
research on improving essay generation in educational settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了微调OpenAI的Whisper对五种阿拉伯方言的影响，发现少量MSA微调数据能显著提升小模型性能，而方言数据池化模型表现与方言专用模型相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业阿拉伯ASR系统在处理方言语音时表现不佳，研究旨在通过微调和数据池化解决这一问题。

Method: 使用Mozilla Common Voice和MASC数据集，评估MSA微调数据量、MSA预训练效果及方言专用与池化模型的差异。

Result: 少量MSA微调数据显著提升小模型性能；MSA预训练效果有限；方言池化模型表现与专用模型相当。

Conclusion: 方言数据池化在平衡数据稀缺问题时，不会显著降低性能，是低资源ASR的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although commercial Arabic automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems support
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), they struggle with dialectal speech. We
investigate the effect of fine-tuning OpenAI's Whisper on five major Arabic
dialects (Gulf, Levantine, Iraqi, Egyptian, Maghrebi) using Mozilla Common
Voice for MSA and the MASC dataset for dialectal speech. We evaluate MSA
training size effects, benefits of pre-training on MSA data, and
dialect-specific versus dialect-pooled models. We find that small amounts of
MSA fine-tuning data yield substantial improvements for smaller models,
matching larger non-fine-tuned models. While MSA pre-training shows minimal
benefit, suggesting limited shared features between MSA and dialects, our
dialect-pooled models perform comparably to dialect-specific ones. This
indicates that pooling dialectal data, when properly balanced, can help address
data scarcity in low-resource ASR without significant performance loss.

*Manon Reusens,Bart Baesens,David Jurgens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种标准化框架，用于分析个性化大语言模型（LLMs）在不同任务和运行中保持角色一致性的能力。研究发现，一致性受角色设定、刻板印象和模型设计影响，且在不同任务中表现不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对不同角色和任务类型下LLMs一致性的全面分析，因此需要一种标准化框架来填补这一空白。

Method: 引入一个标准化框架，评估LLMs在四种角色类别（幸福度、职业、个性和政治立场）和多种任务维度（调查写作、文章生成、社交媒体帖子生成、单轮和多轮对话）中的一致性。

Result: 研究发现，一致性受角色设定、刻板印象和模型设计影响，且在结构化任务和额外上下文下表现更好。

Conclusion: 本文提出的框架为分析LLMs角色一致性提供了标准化方法，揭示了影响一致性的关键因素，为未来研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Personalized Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in diverse
applications, where they are assigned a specific persona - such as a happy high
school teacher - to guide their responses. While prior research has examined
how well LLMs adhere to predefined personas in writing style, a comprehensive
analysis of consistency across different personas and task types is lacking. In
this paper, we introduce a new standardized framework to analyze consistency in
persona-assigned LLMs. We define consistency as the extent to which a model
maintains coherent responses when assigned the same persona across different
tasks and runs. Our framework evaluates personas across four different
categories (happiness, occupation, personality, and political stance) spanning
multiple task dimensions (survey writing, essay generation, social media post
generation, single turn, and multi-turn conversations). Our findings reveal
that consistency is influenced by multiple factors, including the assigned
persona, stereotypes, and model design choices. Consistency also varies across
tasks, increasing with more structured tasks and additional context. All code
is available on GitHub.

TL;DR: EvaLearn是一个评估大语言模型学习能力和效率的新基准，包含648个挑战性问题，要求模型按顺序解决问题，并提供五种自动化指标。测试发现不同模型表现差异显著，且静态能力强的模型在学习能力上未必占优。

Motivation: 现有基准大多并行评估模型，忽视了学习能力的潜力。EvaLearn旨在填补这一空白，通过顺序任务评估模型的学习效率和能力。

Method: EvaLearn包含182个任务序列，共648个问题，模型需按顺序解决。通过五种自动化指标量化学习能力和效率，并测试了九种前沿模型。

Result: 模型表现各异，部分模型（如Claude-3.7-sonnet）学习能力强，而部分模型难以从经验中获益。静态能力强的模型在学习能力上未必占优。

Conclusion: EvaLearn为评估大语言模型提供了新视角，揭示了模型与人类能力的差距，推动了更动态的评估方法发展。

Abstract: We introduce EvaLearn, a pioneering benchmark designed to evaluate large
language models (LLMs) on their learning capability and efficiency in
challenging tasks, a critical, yet underexplored aspect of model potential.
EvaLearn contains 648 challenging problems across six task types, grouped into
182 sequences, each sequence dedicated to one task type. Diverging from most
existing benchmarks that evaluate models in parallel, EvaLearn requires models
to solve problems sequentially, allowing them to leverage the experience gained
from previous solutions. EvaLearn provides five comprehensive automated metrics
to evaluate models and quantify their learning capability and efficiency. We
extensively benchmark nine frontier models and observe varied performance
profiles: some models, such as Claude-3.7-sonnet, start with moderate initial
performance but exhibit strong learning ability, while some models struggle to
benefit from experience and may even show negative transfer. Moreover, we
investigate model performance under two learning settings and find that
instance-level rubrics and teacher-model feedback further facilitate model
learning. Importantly, we observe that current LLMs with stronger static
abilities do not show a clear advantage in learning capability across all
tasks, highlighting that EvaLearn evaluates a new dimension of model
performance. We hope EvaLearn provides a novel evaluation perspective for
assessing LLM potential and understanding the gap between models and human
capabilities, promoting the development of deeper and more dynamic evaluation
approaches. All datasets, the automatic evaluation framework, and the results
studied in this paper are available at the GitHub repository.

Conclusion: 该方法高效且无需复杂数据标注或多模型插值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress by
leveraging Reinforcement Learning and extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
techniques. However, the challenge of performing efficient language
reasoning--especially during inference with extremely long outputs--has drawn
increasing attention from the research community. In this work, we propose a
dynamic ratio-based training pipeline that does not rely on sophisticated data
annotations or interpolation between multiple models. We continuously balance
the weights between the model's System-1 and System-2 data to eliminate
redundant reasoning processes while preserving the model's reasoning
capability. We validate our approach across models on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B
and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-14B and on a diverse set of benchmarks with varying
difficulty levels. Our method significantly reduces the number of output tokens
by nearly 40% while maintaining the accuracy of the reasoning. Our code and
data will be available soon.

Motivation: 现有规划方法存在严格约束和级联错误的问题，限制了LLM代理在规划任务中的表现。

Method: DPPM将复杂任务分解为子任务，并行生成子计划，并通过验证和优化模块合并为全局计划。

Result: 实验表明，DPPM在旅行规划任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DPPM通过并行规划和错误修正，有效提升了LLM在规划任务中的性能。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), planning tasks
still present challenges for LLM-based agents. Existing planning methods face
two key limitations: heavy constraints and cascading errors. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel parallel planning paradigm, which Decomposes,
Plans for subtasks in Parallel, and Merges subplans into a final plan (DPPM).
Specifically, DPPM decomposes the complex task based on constraints into
subtasks, generates the subplan for each subtask in parallel, and merges them
into a global plan. In addition, our approach incorporates a verification and
refinement module, enabling error correction and conflict resolution.
Experimental results demonstrate that DPPM significantly outperforms existing
methods in travel planning tasks.

Result: 构建BOOST-QA数据集，实验显示模型在多任务泛化和复杂推理任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: MASTER显著提升模型性能，为未来研究提供新思路。

Abstract: Instruction fine-tuning is crucial in NLP tasks, enhancing pretrained models'
instruction-following capabilities and task-specific performance. However,
obtaining high-quality fine-tuning data for large models is challenging due to
data collection difficulties and high production costs. To address this, we
propose MASTER, a novel data augmentation method that enriches original data
through interactions among multiple agents with varying cognitive levels. We
simulate three pedagogically grounded teaching scenarios, leveraging
multi-agent conversations to generate high-quality teacher-student interaction
data. Utilizing MASTER, we construct BOOST-QA, a fine-tuning dataset augmented
from existing datasets like Orca-Math-200k, ProcQA, and OpenHermes2.5.
Experiments show that models fine-tuned with BOOST-QA perform excellently
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating strong multitask generalization.
Notably, MASTER significantly improves models' reasoning abilities in complex
tasks, providing valuable insights for future research.

Motivation: 研究语言模型内部表示如何识别和区分命名实体提及，解决实体与提及之间的多对多对应问题。

Method: 提出类似聚类质量指标的框架，通过聚类分析量化模型内部表示中实体提及的聚类效果。

Result: 实验显示Transformer自回归模型能有效识别和区分实体，指标介于0.66至0.9之间，且实体信息在早期层低维子空间中紧凑表示。

Conclusion: 语言模型内部表示与实体中心知识结构存在同构性，揭示了模型如何组织和利用实体信息。

Abstract: We analyze the extent to which internal representations of language models
(LMs) identify and distinguish mentions of named entities, focusing on the
many-to-many correspondence between entities and their mentions. We first
formulate two problems of entity mentions -- ambiguity and variability -- and
propose a framework analogous to clustering quality metrics. Specifically, we
quantify through cluster analysis of LM internal representations the extent to
which mentions of the same entity cluster together and mentions of different
entities remain separated. Our experiments examine five Transformer-based
autoregressive models, showing that they effectively identify and distinguish
entities with metrics analogous to precision and recall ranging from 0.66 to
0.9. Further analysis reveals that entity-related information is compactly
represented in a low-dimensional linear subspace at early LM layers.
Additionally, we clarify how the characteristics of entity representations
influence word prediction performance. These findings are interpreted through
the lens of isomorphism between LM representations and entity-centric knowledge
structures in the real world, providing insights into how LMs internally
organize and use entity information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在垂直领域存在准确性、推理和可解释性问题，传统对齐方法忽略知识和推理逻辑。

Method: RACE-Align构建包含外部知识和显式思维链的偏好数据集，并使用DPO算法对齐LLM。

Result: 在中医领域实验中，RACE-Align显著优于基础模型和仅用SFT微调的模型。

Conclusion: RACE-Align为提升LLM在复杂垂直领域的知识应用和推理可靠性提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with accuracy, domain-specific
reasoning, and interpretability in vertical domains. Traditional preference
alignment methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) often overlook the underlying knowledge
sources and reasoning logic. This paper introduces RACE-Align
(Retrieval-Augmented and Chain-of-Thought Enhanced Alignment), a novel
framework designed to address these limitations. RACE-Align systematically
constructs a binary preference dataset incorporating external knowledge support
and explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, then aligns LLMs using the DPO
algorithm. The core innovation lies in its preference data construction
strategy: it integrates AI-driven retrieval for factual grounding, enhancing
knowledgeability and accuracy, and emphasizes the optimization of
domain-specific CoT, treating the reasoning process itself as a key preference
dimension. A multi-stage, AI-driven refinement pipeline cost-effectively
generates these preference pairs. Experimental validation in Traditional
Chinese Medicine (TCM) using Qwen3-1.7B as the base model demonstrates that
RACE-Align significantly outperforms the original base model and a model
fine-tuned only with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Improvements were observed
across multiple dimensions, including answer accuracy, information richness,
application of TCM thinking patterns, logicality and depth of reasoning, and
interpretability. These findings suggest RACE-Align offers an effective pathway
to enhance LLMs' knowledge application, reasoning reliability, and process
transparency in complex vertical domains.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索如何利用自然文本（尤其是Twitter）补充常识知识库中的性别刻板印象信息。

Method: 方法包括从文本语料库和Twitter提取性别相关行为，使用OMCS和性别信息计算性别偏见，并与人工标注标准对比。

Result: 结果显示，基于语料库的预测与人工标准的相关性为0.47，ROC曲线下面积为0.76，并提供了两个数据集。

Conclusion: 结论表明，利用自然文本（尤其是Twitter）补充常识知识库中的性别刻板印象是可行的。

Abstract: We extracted gender-specific actions from text corpora and Twitter, and
compared them to stereotypical expectations of people. We used Open Mind Common
Sense (OMCS), a commonsense knowledge repository, to focus on actions that are
pertinent to common sense and daily life of humans. We use the gender
information of Twitter users and Web-corpus-based pronoun/name gender
heuristics to compute the gender bias of the actions. With high recall, we
obtained a Spearman correlation of 0.47 between corpus-based predictions and a
human gold standard, and an area under the ROC curve of 0.76 when predicting
the polarity of the gold standard. We conclude that it is feasible to use
natural text (and a Twitter-derived corpus in particular) in order to augment
commonsense repositories with the stereotypical gender expectations of actions.
We also present a dataset of 441 commonsense actions with human judges' ratings
on whether the action is typically/slightly masculine/feminine (or neutral),
and another larger dataset of 21,442 actions automatically rated by the methods
we investigate in this study.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体的快速发展加剧了攻击性、暴力和粗俗言论的传播，这对社会和网络安全构成严重威胁。阿拉伯语的复杂性、方言变体和标记数据稀缺使得检测更具挑战性。

Method: 通过多任务学习联合训练攻击性、暴力和粗俗言论检测任务，动态调整任务权重，并采用主动学习策略选择信息量最大的样本进行训练。还引入了加权表情符号处理以捕捉语义线索。

Result: 在OSACT2022数据集上，该框架的宏F1分数达到85.42%，优于现有方法，且所需微调样本更少。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合多任务学习和主动学习的框架在资源有限的情况下能高效准确地检测攻击性语言。

Abstract: The rapid growth of social media has amplified the spread of offensive,
violent, and vulgar speech, which poses serious societal and cybersecurity
concerns. Detecting such content in Arabic text is particularly complex due to
limited labeled data, dialectal variations, and the language's inherent
complexity. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates multi-task
learning (MTL) with active learning to enhance offensive speech detection in
Arabic social media text. By jointly training on two auxiliary tasks, violent
and vulgar speech, the model leverages shared representations to improve the
detection accuracy of the offensive speech. Our approach dynamically adjusts
task weights during training to balance the contribution of each task and
optimize performance. To address the scarcity of labeled data, we employ an
active learning strategy through several uncertainty sampling techniques to
iteratively select the most informative samples for model training. We also
introduce weighted emoji handling to better capture semantic cues. Experimental
results on the OSACT2022 dataset show that the proposed framework achieves a
state-of-the-art macro F1-score of 85.42%, outperforming existing methods while
using significantly fewer fine-tuning samples. The findings of this study
highlight the potential of integrating MTL with active learning for efficient
and accurate offensive language detection in resource-constrained settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 词汇使用是第二语言（L2）熟练度的核心指标，但现有自动化评估方法通常仅关注词性（PoS）相关的词汇使用，缺乏对上下文精确性的评估。

Method: 结合LLMs和EVP，通过上下文关联词汇使用与熟练度水平，并比较LLMs与基于PoS的基线方法。

Result: LLMs能够利用额外的语义信息，表现优于基线方法，并验证了EVP熟练度水平的一致性。

Conclusion: LLMs在词汇评估任务中表现出色，为L2学习者提供了更精细的评估工具。

Abstract: Vocabulary use is a fundamental aspect of second language (L2) proficiency.
To date, its assessment by automated systems has typically examined the
context-independent, or part-of-speech (PoS) related use of words. This paper
introduces a novel approach to enable fine-grained vocabulary evaluation
exploiting the precise use of words within a sentence. The scheme combines
large language models (LLMs) with the English Vocabulary Profile (EVP). The EVP
is a standard lexical resource that enables in-context vocabulary use to be
linked with proficiency level. We evaluate the ability of LLMs to assign
proficiency levels to individual words as they appear in L2 learner writing,
addressing key challenges such as polysemy, contextual variation, and
multi-word expressions. We compare LLMs to a PoS-based baseline. LLMs appear to
exploit additional semantic information that yields improved performance. We
also explore correlations between word-level proficiency and essay-level
proficiency. Finally, the approach is applied to examine the consistency of the
EVP proficiency levels. Results show that LLMs are well-suited for the task of
vocabulary assessment.

TL;DR: HC-Bench测试显示，视觉语言模型（VLMs）在检测隐藏内容（如光学幻觉或AI生成图像）时表现极差，准确率仅为0-5.36%。通过SemVink方法（降低图像分辨率至32-128像素），准确率提升至99%以上，揭示了VLMs过度依赖高层语义的缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示VLMs在感知任务（如检测隐藏内容）中的局限性，并提出改进方法。

Method: 引入HC-Bench基准测试（112张包含隐藏内容的图像），并提出SemVink方法（通过降低图像分辨率消除视觉噪声）。

Result: VLMs在HC-Bench上表现极差（0-5.36%），而SemVink方法显著提升准确率至99%以上。

Conclusion: VLMs存在架构缺陷，需结合多尺度处理以提升实际应用中的鲁棒性，如医疗影像和安全领域。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in semantic tasks but falter at a core
human capability: detecting hidden content in optical illusions or AI-generated
images through perceptual adjustments like zooming. We introduce HC-Bench, a
benchmark of 112 images with hidden text, objects, and illusions, revealing
that leading VLMs achieve near-zero accuracy (0-5.36%)-even with explicit
prompting. Humans resolve such ambiguities instinctively, yet VLMs fail due to
an overreliance on high-level semantics. Strikingly, we propose SemVink
(Semantic Visual Thinking) by simply scaling images to low resolutions (32-128
pixels), which unlocks >99% accuracy by eliminating redundant visual noise.
This exposes a critical architectural flaw: VLMs prioritize abstract reasoning
over low-level visual operations crucial for real-world robustness. Our work
urges a shift toward hybrid models integrating multi-scale processing, bridging
the gap between computational vision and human cognition for applications in
medical imaging, security, and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在自然语言处理任务中表现优异，但计算和内存资源需求高。结构化矩阵表示是减少参数量的有效途径，但直接应用于预训练模型可能不准确。

Method: 利用LLM输出在特定正交变换下不变的性质，寻找能显著提升权重矩阵在结构化类别中可压缩性的变换。

Result: 该方法适用于多种支持高效投影操作的结构化矩阵类型。

Conclusion: 通过正交变换优化结构化矩阵表示，有效减少了LLMs的参数需求，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive results in natural
language processing tasks but require a significant amount of computational and
memory resources. Structured matrix representations are a promising way for
reducing the number of parameters of these models. However, it seems
unrealistic to expect that weight matrices of pretrained models can be
accurately represented by structured matrices without any fine-tuning. To
overcome this issue, we utilize the fact that LLM output is invariant under
certain orthogonal transformations of weight matrices. This insight can be
leveraged to identify transformations that significantly improve the
compressibility of weights within structured classes. The proposed approach is
applicable to various types of structured matrices that support efficient
projection operations. Code is available at

Conclusion: TO-GATE通过优化对话轨迹有效提升了任务对齐的问题生成和回答质量。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can effectively elicit human preferences through
multi-turn dialogue. Complex tasks can be accomplished through iterative
clarifying questions and final responses generated by an LLM acting as a
questioner (STaR-GATE; Andukuri et al., 2024}). However, existing approaches
based on self-taught reasoning struggle to identify optimal dialogue
trajectories and avoid irrelevant questions to the tasks. To address this
limitation, we propose TO-GATE, a novel framework that enhances question
generation through trajectory optimization, which consists of two key
components: a clarification resolver that generates optimal questioning
trajectories, and a summarizer that ensures task-aligned final responses. The
trajectory optimization enables the model to produce effective elicitation
questions and summary responses tailored to specific tasks. Experimental
results demonstrate that TO-GATE significantly outperforms baseline methods,
achieving a 9.32% improvement on standard preference elicitation tasks.

*Ludovic Moncla,Hédi Zeghidi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究比较了多种命名实体识别（NER）方法在历史文本中的应用，包括传统CRF、spaCy模型、Transformer架构（如CamemBERT）和Flair序列标注模型。实验基于18世纪法国百科全书的GeoEDdA数据集，提出将NER任务分为token级和span级分类以处理嵌套实体结构，并评估了生成式语言模型在低资源场景下的潜力。结果表明，Transformer模型在嵌套实体上表现最佳，而生成式模型在数据稀缺时具有潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文本中的NER面临非标准化语言、古旧拼写和嵌套实体的挑战，需要探索多种方法以应对这些复杂性。

Method: 研究比较了CRF、spaCy、CamemBERT和Flair等方法，并将NER任务分为token级和span级分类，同时评估了生成式语言模型的少样本学习能力。

Result: Transformer模型在嵌套实体上表现最优，生成式模型在低资源场景下展现出潜力。

Conclusion: 历史文本NER仍需解决复杂性问题，未来可结合符号与神经方法以提升性能。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) in historical texts presents unique challenges
due to non-standardized language, archaic orthography, and nested or
overlapping entities. This study benchmarks a diverse set of NER approaches,
ranging from classical Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and spaCy-based models
to transformer-based architectures such as CamemBERT and sequence-labeling
models like Flair. Experiments are conducted on the GeoEDdA dataset, a richly
annotated corpus derived from 18th-century French encyclopedias. We propose
framing NER as both token-level and span-level classification to accommodate
complex nested entity structures typical of historical documents. Additionally,
we evaluate the emerging potential of few-shot prompting with generative
language models for low-resource scenarios. Our results demonstrate that while
transformer-based models achieve state-of-the-art performance, especially on
nested entities, generative models offer promising alternatives when labeled
data are scarce. The study highlights ongoing challenges in historical NER and
suggests avenues for hybrid approaches combining symbolic and neural methods to
better capture the intricacies of early modern French text.

Motivation: 反驳CoT引发大语言模型真正推理能力的观点，提出其仅通过结构约束模仿推理形式。

Method: 理论分析，指出CoT通过强制生成中间步骤，利用模型的序列预测和模式匹配能力。

Result: CoT通过约束输出序列模仿推理过程，而非实现真正的抽象推理。

Conclusion: CoT是一种有效的结构约束工具，但并未实现真正的推理能力。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has demonstrably enhanced the performance of
Large Language Models on tasks requiring multi-step inference. This success has
led to widespread claims of emergent reasoning capabilities in these models. In
this paper, we present a theoretical counter-perspective: Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) does not elicit genuine, abstract reasoning. Instead, we argue that
Chain-of-Thought functions as a powerful structural constraint that guides
Large Language Models to imitate the form of reasoning. By forcing the
generation of intermediate steps, Chain-of-Thought leverages the model immense
capacity for sequence prediction and pattern matching, effectively constraining
its output to sequences that resemble coherent thought processes.

Motivation: 德国方言在当前ASR研究中代表性不足，需研究模型对方言变异的鲁棒性。

Method: 构建包含四种方言和标准德语的Betthupferl数据集，测试多语言ASR模型的表现。

Result: ASR模型输出介于方言和标准德语之间，最佳模型有时会标准化语法差异，但更接近方言结构。

Conclusion: Betthupferl数据集为方言ASR研究提供了基础，未来可进一步优化模型对方言的处理。

Abstract: Although Germany has a diverse landscape of dialects, they are
underrepresented in current automatic speech recognition (ASR) research. To
enable studies of how robust models are towards dialectal variation, we present
Betthupferl, an evaluation dataset containing four hours of read speech in
three dialect groups spoken in Southeast Germany (Franconian, Bavarian,
Alemannic), and half an hour of Standard German speech. We provide both
dialectal and Standard German transcriptions, and analyze the linguistic
differences between them. We benchmark several multilingual state-of-the-art
ASR models on speech translation into Standard German, and find differences
between how much the output resembles the dialectal vs. standardized
transcriptions. Qualitative error analyses of the best ASR model reveal that it
sometimes normalizes grammatical differences, but often stays closer to the
dialectal constructions.

Motivation: 现有基础模型独立注释细胞，缺乏批级上下文和解释性推理，而专家依赖领域知识批注。

Method: 提出CellPuzzles任务，训练7B参数模型Cell-o1，结合监督微调和强化学习。

Result: Cell-o1在批级准确率上超越基线73%，表现优异且泛化能力强。

Conclusion: Cell-o1通过批级奖励和推理训练，实现了专家级细胞注释性能。

Abstract: Cell type annotation is a key task in analyzing the heterogeneity of
single-cell RNA sequencing data. Although recent foundation models automate
this process, they typically annotate cells independently, without considering
batch-level cellular context or providing explanatory reasoning. In contrast,
human experts often annotate distinct cell types for different cell clusters
based on their domain knowledge. To mimic this workflow, we introduce the
CellPuzzles task, where the objective is to assign unique cell types to a batch
of cells. This benchmark spans diverse tissues, diseases, and donor conditions,
and requires reasoning across the batch-level cellular context to ensure label
uniqueness. We find that off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) struggle on
CellPuzzles, with the best baseline (OpenAI's o1) achieving only 19.0%
batch-level accuracy. To fill this gap, we propose Cell-o1, a 7B LLM trained
via supervised fine-tuning on distilled reasoning traces, followed by
reinforcement learning with batch-level rewards. Cell-o1 achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming o1 by over 73% and generalizing
well across contexts. Further analysis of training dynamics and reasoning
behaviors provides insights into batch-level annotation performance and
emergent expert-like reasoning. Code and data are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了LongBioBench，一种新的长上下文语言模型评估框架，解决了现有评估方法的局限性，并在18个模型中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长上下文语言模型评估方法（真实任务和合成任务）存在局限性，如真实任务复杂且易受数据污染，合成任务缺乏上下文连贯性。

Method: 提出LongBioBench，利用人工生成的传记作为受控环境，评估模型在理解、推理和可信度方面的表现。

Result: 实验表明，大多数模型在语义理解和基础推理上仍有不足，且随着上下文长度增加，可信度下降。

Conclusion: LongBioBench在真实任务和可控性之间取得了更好的平衡，具有高可解释性和可配置性。

Abstract: Existing frameworks for evaluating long-context language models (LCLM) can be
broadly categorized into real-world and synthetic tasks. Despite their utility,
both approaches are accompanied by certain intrinsic limitations. Real-world
tasks are too complex to interpret or characterize and are susceptible to data
contamination. In contrast, synthetic tasks often adopt the
needle-in-the-haystack (NIAH) format, wherein a lack of coherence between the
"needle" and the "haystack" compromises their validity as proxies for realistic
applications. In response to these challenges, we posit that an ideal
long-context evaluation framework should be characterized by three essential
features: $\textit{seamless context}$, $\textit{controllable setting}$, and
$\textit{sound evaluation}$. This study introduces $\textbf{LongBioBench}$, a
novel benchmark that utilizes artificially generated biographies as a
controlled environment for assessing LCLMs across dimensions of
$\textit{understanding}$, $\textit{reasoning}$, and $\textit{trustworthiness}$.
Our experimental evaluation, which includes $\textbf{18}$ LCLMs in total,
demonstrates that most models still exhibit deficiencies in semantic
understanding and elementary reasoning over retrieved results and are less
trustworthy as context length increases. Our further analysis indicates some
design choices employed by existing synthetic benchmarks, such as contextual
non-coherence, numerical needles, and the absence of distractors, rendering
them vulnerable to test the model long-context capabilities. Moreover, we also
reveal that long-context continual pretraining primarily adjusts RoPE embedding
to accommodate extended context lengths. To sum up, compared to previous
synthetic benchmarks, LongBioBench achieves a better trade-off between
mirroring authentic language tasks and maintaining controllability, and is
highly interpretable and configurable.

Result: 微调基础模型表现最佳，不同症状需不同方法，最终提交的五个测试运行在官方评估中击败16个团队。

Conclusion: 通过灵活的技术选择和合成数据增强，团队在抑郁症症状搜索任务中取得了最优结果。

Abstract: In this work, we describe our team's approach to eRisk's 2025 Task 1: Search
for Symptoms of Depression. Given a set of sentences and the Beck's Depression
Inventory - II (BDI) questionnaire, participants were tasked with submitting up
to 1,000 sentences per depression symptom in the BDI, sorted by relevance.
Participant submissions were evaluated according to standard Information
Retrieval (IR) metrics, including Average Precision (AP) and R-Precision
(R-PREC). The provided training data, however, consisted of sentences labeled
as to whether a given sentence was relevant or not w.r.t. one of BDI's
symptoms. Due to this labeling limitation, we framed our development as a
binary classification task for each BDI symptom, and evaluated accordingly. To
that end, we split the available labeled data into training and validation
sets, and explored foundation model fine-tuning, sentence similarity, Large
Language Model (LLM) prompting, and ensemble techniques. The validation results
revealed that fine-tuning foundation models yielded the best performance,
particularly when enhanced with synthetic data to mitigate class imbalance. We
also observed that the optimal approach varied by symptom. Based on these
insights, we devised five independent test runs, two of which used ensemble
methods. These runs achieved the highest scores in the official IR evaluation,
outperforming submissions from 16 other teams.

Result: 实验证明定量评估能有效提升现有评估的预测能力。

Conclusion: 该框架在计算和统计效率上优于监督微调，适用于人类反馈有限的应用场景。

Abstract: LLM-as-a-judge is a framework in which a large language model (LLM)
automatically evaluates the output of another LLM. We propose quantitative LLM
judges, which align evaluation scores of existing LLM judges to human scores in
a given domain using regression models. The models are trained to improve the
score of the original judge by using the judge's textual evaluation and score.
We present four quantitative judges for different types of absolute and
relative feedback, which showcases the generality and versatility of our
framework. Our framework is more computationally efficient than supervised
fine-tuning and can be more statistically efficient when human feedback is
limited, which is expected in most applications of our work. We validate these
claims empirically on four datasets using two base judges. Our experiments show
that quantitative judges can effectively improve the predictive power of
existing judges through post-hoc modeling.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定数量的智能体和静态通信结构，限制了其适应不同任务复杂性的能力。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：先独立训练软剪枝网络以确定任务特定的最优智能体数量和通信拓扑，再联合优化硬剪枝和软剪枝以动态配置智能体数量和通信结构。

Conclusion: AGP框架在性能、任务适应性、令牌经济性和训练效率方面均表现出色，超越了现有基线方法。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based multi-agent systems have shown remarkable
performance in various tasks, especially when enhanced through collaborative
communication. However, current methods often rely on a fixed number of agents
and static communication structures, limiting their ability to adapt to varying
task complexities. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Graph Pruning (AGP), a
novel task-adaptive multi-agent collaboration framework that jointly optimizes
agent quantity (hard-pruning) and communication topology (soft-pruning).
Specifically, our method employs a two-stage training strategy: firstly,
independently training soft-pruning networks for different agent quantities to
determine optimal agent-quantity-specific complete graphs and positional masks
across specific tasks; and then jointly optimizing hard-pruning and
soft-pruning within a maximum complete graph to dynamically configure the
number of agents and their communication topologies per task. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach is: (1) High-performing, achieving
state-of-the-art results across six benchmarks and consistently generalizes
across multiple mainstream LLM architectures, with a increase in performance of
$2.58\%\sim 9.84\%$; (2) Task-adaptive, dynamically constructing optimized
communication topologies tailored to specific tasks, with an extremely high
performance in all three task categories (general reasoning, mathematical
reasoning, and code generation); (3) Token-economical, having fewer training
steps and token consumption at the same time, with a decrease in token
consumption of $90\%+$; and (4) Training-efficient, achieving high performance
with very few training steps compared with other methods. The performance will
surpass the existing baselines after about ten steps of training under six
benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注文档级的二元检测，忽略了人类与AI共同创作的文本，因此需要开发细粒度的检测方法。

Method: 提出HACo-Det数据集，改造七种文档级检测器进行词级和句子级检测实验。

Result: 实验显示基于指标的方法表现较差（平均F1分数0.462），而微调模型表现更优且泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: 细粒度共同创作文本检测仍具挑战性，需进一步研究改进，如上下文窗口等因素。

Abstract: The misuse of large language models (LLMs) poses potential risks, motivating
the development of machine-generated text (MGT) detection. Existing literature
primarily concentrates on binary, document-level detection, thereby neglecting
texts that are composed jointly by human and LLM contributions. Hence, this
paper explores the possibility of fine-grained MGT detection under human-AI
coauthoring. We suggest fine-grained detectors can pave pathways toward
coauthored text detection with a numeric AI ratio. Specifically, we propose a
dataset, HACo-Det, which produces human-AI coauthored texts via an automatic
pipeline with word-level attribution labels. We retrofit seven prevailing
document-level detectors to generalize them to word-level detection. Then we
evaluate these detectors on HACo-Det on both word- and sentence-level detection
tasks. Empirical results show that metric-based methods struggle to conduct
fine-grained detection with a 0.462 average F1 score, while finetuned models
show superior performance and better generalization across domains. However, we
argue that fine-grained co-authored text detection is far from solved. We
further analyze factors influencing performance, e.g., context window, and
highlight the limitations of current methods, pointing to potential avenues for
improvement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art results across
diverse domains, yet their development remains reliant on vast amounts of
publicly available data, raising concerns about data scarcity and the lack of
access to domain-specific, sensitive information. Federated Learning (FL)
presents a compelling framework to address these challenges by enabling
decentralized fine-tuning on pre-trained LLMs without sharing raw data.
However, the compatibility and performance of pre-trained LLMs in FL settings
remain largely under explored. We introduce the FlowerTune LLM Leaderboard, a
first-of-its-kind benchmarking suite designed to evaluate federated fine-tuning
of LLMs across four diverse domains: general NLP, finance, medical, and coding.
Each domain includes federated instruction-tuning datasets and domain-specific
evaluation metrics. Our results, obtained through a collaborative, open-source
and community-driven approach, provide the first comprehensive comparison
across 26 pre-trained LLMs with different aggregation and fine-tuning
strategies under federated settings, offering actionable insights into model
performance, resource constraints, and domain adaptation. This work lays the
foundation for developing privacy-preserving, domain-specialized LLMs for
real-world applications.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在文本理解和生成方面表现出色，但其产生的幻觉问题（事实不一致输出）仍是关键挑战。现有方法多集中在输入或输出层面，忽略了内部信息细化过程及早期层的作用。

Method: 提出PLI方法，通过数学插值在相邻层之间插入中间层，扩展信息处理和传输深度，提升事实一致性。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的实验表明，PLI能有效减少幻觉，并在多数情况下优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: PLI的成功与LLMs内部机制密切相关，该方法为提升模型事实性提供了一种高效且资源友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in text
understanding and generation. However, their tendency to produce factually
inconsistent outputs, commonly referred to as ''hallucinations'', remains a
critical challenge. Existing approaches, such as retrieval-based and
inference-time correction methods, primarily address this issue at the input or
output level, often overlooking the intrinsic information refinement process
and the role of premature layers. Meanwhile, alignment- and fine-tuning-based
methods are resource-intensive. In this paper, we propose PLI (Premature Layers
Interpolation), a novel, training-free, and plug-and-play intervention designed
to enhance factuality. PLI mitigates hallucinations by inserting premature
layers formed through mathematical interpolation with adjacent layers. Inspired
by stable diffusion and sampling steps, PLI extends the depth of information
processing and transmission in LLMs, improving factual coherence. Experiments
on four publicly available datasets demonstrate that PLI effectively reduces
hallucinations while outperforming existing baselines in most cases. Further
analysis suggests that the success of layer interpolation is closely linked to
LLMs' internal mechanisms. To promote reproducibility, we will release our code
and data upon acceptance.

Abstract: Full-duplex spoken dialogue systems, which can model simultaneous
bidirectional features of human conversations such as speech overlaps and
backchannels, have attracted significant attention recently. However, the study
of full-duplex spoken dialogue systems for the Japanese language has been
limited, and the research on their development in Japanese remains scarce. In
this paper, we present the first publicly available full-duplex spoken dialogue
model in Japanese, which is built upon Moshi, a full-duplex dialogue model in
English. Our model is trained through a two-stage process: pre-training on a
large-scale spoken dialogue data in Japanese, followed by fine-tuning on
high-quality stereo spoken dialogue data. We further enhance the model's
performance by incorporating synthetic dialogue data generated by a
multi-stream text-to-speech system. Evaluation experiments demonstrate that the
trained model outperforms Japanese baseline models in both naturalness and
meaningfulness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试领先的LLMs在初级保健教育中的能力，特别是回答MRCGP风格考试问题的表现。

Method: 使用o3、Claude Opus 4、Grok3和Gemini 2.5 Pro回答100道随机选择的MRCGP考试题，评分对比正确答案。

Result: o3得分99.0%，其他模型均为95.0%，远超人类平均分73.0%。

Conclusion: LLMs，尤其是推理模型，在支持初级保健方面潜力巨大，特别是针对临床数据训练的模型。

Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial
potential to support clinical practice. Other than Chat GPT4 and its
predecessors, few LLMs, especially those of the leading and more powerful
reasoning model class, have been subjected to medical specialty examination
questions, including in the domain of primary care. This paper aimed to test
the capabilities of leading LLMs as of May 2025 (o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and
Gemini 2.5 Pro) in primary care education, specifically in answering Member of
the Royal College of General Practitioners (MRCGP) style examination questions.
  Methods: o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro were tasked to answer
100 randomly chosen multiple choice questions from the Royal College of General
Practitioners GP SelfTest on 25 May 2025. Questions included textual
information, laboratory results, and clinical images. Each model was prompted
to answer as a GP in the UK and was provided with full question information.
Each question was attempted once by each model. Responses were scored against
correct answers provided by GP SelfTest.
  Results: The total score of o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro was
99.0%, 95.0%, 95.0%, and 95.0%, respectively. The average peer score for the
same questions was 73.0%.
  Discussion: All models performed remarkably well, and all substantially
exceeded the average performance of GPs and GP registrars who had answered the
same questions. o3 demonstrated the best performance, while the performances of
the other leading models were comparable with each other and were not
substantially lower than that of o3. These findings strengthen the case for
LLMs, particularly reasoning models, to support the delivery of primary care,
especially those that have been specifically trained on primary care clinical

TL;DR: 论文评估了习语翻译在文本到文本和语音到文本翻译系统中的表现，发现语音到文本系统在习语翻译上表现较差，需改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器翻译系统在习语翻译上仍有挑战，尤其是语音到文本系统，研究较少。

Method: 系统比较了文本到文本和语音到文本翻译系统在德语到英语和俄语到英语上的表现，包括端到端系统和大型语言模型。

Result: 语音到文本系统在习语翻译上表现显著下降，常采用字面翻译，而文本翻译系统和大型语言模型表现更好。

Conclusion: 需针对习语开发特定策略并改进语音到文本系统的内部表示。

Abstract: Idioms are defined as a group of words with a figurative meaning not
deducible from their individual components. Although modern machine translation
systems have made remarkable progress, translating idioms remains a major
challenge, especially for speech-to-text systems, where research on this topic
is notably sparse. In this paper, we systematically evaluate idiom translation
as compared to conventional news translation in both text-to-text machine
translation (MT) and speech-to-text translation (SLT) systems across two
language pairs (German to English, Russian to English). We compare
state-of-the-art end-to-end SLT systems (SeamlessM4T SLT-to-text, Whisper Large
v3) with MT systems (SeamlessM4T SLT-to-text, No Language Left Behind), Large
Language Models (DeepSeek, LLaMA) and cascaded alternatives. Our results reveal
that SLT systems experience a pronounced performance drop on idiomatic data,
often reverting to literal translations even in higher layers, whereas MT
systems and Large Language Models demonstrate better handling of idioms. These
findings underscore the need for idiom-specific strategies and improved
internal representations in SLT architectures.

TL;DR: 提出多智能体框架解决隐私政策问答系统中的方言偏见问题，提升零样本准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐私政策复杂且现有系统对非标准英语方言用户存在性能差异，需设计更公平的系统。

Method: 结合方言代理（翻译查询为标准英语）和隐私政策代理（优化预测），无需重新训练。

Result: 在PrivacyQA和PolicyQA上，GPT-4o-mini的零样本准确率分别提升至0.601和0.464。

Conclusion: 多智能体协作有效减少方言偏见，强调需考虑语言多样性以确保隐私信息公平获取。

Abstract: Privacy policies inform users about data collection and usage, yet their
complexity limits accessibility for diverse populations. Existing Privacy
Policy Question Answering (QA) systems exhibit performance disparities across
English dialects, disadvantaging speakers of non-standard varieties. We propose
a novel multi-agent framework inspired by human-centered design principles to
mitigate dialectal biases. Our approach integrates a Dialect Agent, which
translates queries into Standard American English (SAE) while preserving
dialectal intent, and a Privacy Policy Agent, which refines predictions using
domain expertise. Unlike prior approaches, our method does not require
retraining or dialect-specific fine-tuning, making it broadly applicable across
models and domains. Evaluated on PrivacyQA and PolicyQA, our framework improves
GPT-4o-mini's zero-shot accuracy from 0.394 to 0.601 on PrivacyQA and from
0.352 to 0.464 on PolicyQA, surpassing or matching few-shot baselines without
additional training data. These results highlight the effectiveness of
structured agent collaboration in mitigating dialect biases and underscore the
importance of designing NLP systems that account for linguistic diversity to
ensure equitable access to privacy information.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何在不同法律抽象层次上调整大型语言模型（LLMs）以检测仇恨言论，发现模型在法律评估上与专家仍有差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs对法律系统的内化程度，特别是在德国刑法中仇恨言论的分类任务。

Method: 提出并比较了在不同法律抽象层次上调整LLMs的方法。

Result: 模型在具体法律知识上表现较好，但在抽象法律知识上缺乏深度理解且易自相矛盾。

Conclusion: LLMs在法律评估任务中仍需改进，尤其是在抽象法律知识的理解和一致性上。

Abstract: The assessment of legal problems requires the consideration of a specific
legal system and its levels of abstraction, from constitutional law to
statutory law to case law. The extent to which Large Language Models (LLMs)
internalize such legal systems is unknown. In this paper, we propose and
investigate different approaches to condition LLMs at different levels of
abstraction in legal systems. This paper examines different approaches to
conditioning LLMs at multiple levels of abstraction in legal systems to detect
potentially punishable hate speech. We focus on the task of classifying whether
a specific social media posts falls under the criminal offense of incitement to
hatred as prescribed by the German Criminal Code. The results show that there
is still a significant performance gap between models and legal experts in the
legal assessment of hate speech, regardless of the level of abstraction with
which the models were conditioned. Our analysis revealed, that models
conditioned on abstract legal knowledge lacked deep task understanding, often
contradicting themselves and hallucinating answers, while models using concrete
legal knowledge performed reasonably well in identifying relevant target
groups, but struggled with classifying target conducts.

TL;DR: OpenHands-Versa是一种通用AI代理，使用少量通用工具（如代码编辑、网页搜索等）在多样化任务中表现优异，超越专用代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代理多为专用，难以泛化。本文探讨如何用最少通用工具实现多样化任务的高性能。

Method: 开发OpenHands-Versa代理，结合代码编辑、网页搜索、多模态浏览等通用工具。

Result: 在SWE-Bench Multimodal等三个基准测试中，性能优于专用代理，成功率提升最高9.1%。

Conclusion: 通用代理可行，OpenHands-Versa为未来研究提供强基线。

Abstract: Modern human labor is characterized by specialization; we train for years and
develop particular tools that allow us to perform well across a variety of
tasks. In addition, AI agents have been specialized for domains such as
software engineering, web navigation, and workflow automation. However, this
results in agents that are good for one thing but fail to generalize beyond
their intended scope. One reason for this is that agent developers provide a
highly specialized set of tools or make architectural decisions optimized for a
specific use case or benchmark. In this work, we ask the question: what is the
minimal set of general tools that can be used to achieve high performance
across a diverse set of tasks? Our answer is OpenHands-Versa, a generalist
agent built with a modest number of general tools: code editing and execution,
web search, as well as multimodal web browsing and file access. Importantly,
OpenHands-Versa demonstrates superior or competitive performance over leading
specialized agents across three diverse and challenging benchmarks: SWE-Bench
Multimodal, GAIA, and The Agent Company, outperforming the best-performing
previously published results with absolute improvements in success rate of 9.1,
1.3, and 9.1 points respectively. Further, we show how existing
state-of-the-art multi-agent systems fail to generalize beyond their target
domains. These results demonstrate the feasibility of developing a generalist
agent to solve diverse tasks and establish OpenHands-Versa as a strong baseline
for future research.

Motivation: 当前SLU技术依赖大量训练数据，但特定任务或语言的标注数据有限，而指令调优的大语言模型（LLMs）在少量样本下表现优异，因此探索如何通过IR方法优化提示以提升SLU性能。

Method: 利用信息检索（IR）方法选择示例，构建增强提示，应用于SLU任务，并在多个SLU基准上评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于词汇的IR方法在不增加提示长度的情况下显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 通过IR方法优化提示是一种有效的SLU任务性能提升策略。

Abstract: Understanding user queries is fundamental in many applications, such as home
assistants, booking systems, or recommendations. Accordingly, it is crucial to
develop accurate Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) approaches to ensure the
reliability of the considered system. Current State-of-the-Art SLU techniques
rely on large amounts of training data; however, only limited annotated
examples are available for specific tasks or languages.
  In the meantime, instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) have shown
exceptional performance on unseen tasks in a few-shot setting when provided
with adequate prompts. In this work, we propose to explore example selection by
leveraging Information retrieval (IR) approaches to build an enhanced prompt
that is applied to an SLU task. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
method on several SLU benchmarks. Experimental results show that lexical IR
methods significantly enhance performance without increasing prompt length.

Result: 研究发现VAPO框架在长期价值建模中存在根本性限制，尤其是在稀疏奖励环境下。

Conclusion: 结论指出需要进一步研究以开发更强大的LLM代理，克服当前RL在长期推理中的局限性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) enhances large language models (LLMs) in complex,
long-chain-of-thought (long-CoT) reasoning. The advanced VAPO framework,
despite sophisticated mechanisms like Decoupled GAE, theoretically faces
fundamental limitations in comprehensively modeling and leveraging deep,
long-term value for fine-grained, step-by-step policy guidance in extended
reasoning chains. We argue these limitations stem from inherent difficulties in
credit assignment, value function representational capacity with temporally
abstracted goals, and translating global value signals into local policy
improvements, especially with sparse rewards. Our theoretical analysis examines
these aspects to illuminate VAPO's boundaries in long-term value modeling,
aiming to deepen understanding of current RL for advanced reasoning and suggest
future research for more robust LLM agents.

Method: 通过回答适合中学生的多语言事实性问题，评估Llama3.1模型的表现。

Result: 模型不仅提供冗余且真实性较低的信息，还加剧了对稀有语言的偏见。

Conclusion: 需进一步改进模型以确保其在多语言教育中的准确性和公平性。

Abstract: Factuality is a necessary precursor to useful educational tools. As adoption

correctness in all settings is paramount. Despite their strong English
capabilities, LLM performance in other languages is largely untested. In this
work, we evaluate the correctness of the Llama3.1 family of models in answering
factual questions appropriate for middle and high school students. We
demonstrate that LLMs not only provide extraneous and less truthful
information, but also exacerbate existing biases against rare languages.

Motivation: 评估语言模型在文学分析任务中的能力，尤其是对全球叙事推理和细致文本分析的要求。

Method: 使用RELiC数据集构建基准，提供全文和缺失引用的文学批评，要求模型生成缺失引用。

Result: Gemini Pro 2.5模型表现优于人类专家（62.5% vs. 50%），而最佳开源模型仅29.1%。

Conclusion: 尽管模型表现优异，但在处理文学信号和避免过度生成方面仍有挑战，需进一步研究。

Abstract: How well do modern long-context language models understand literary fiction?
We explore this question via the task of literary evidence retrieval,
repurposing the RELiC dataset of That et al. (2022) to construct a benchmark
where the entire text of a primary source (e.g., The Great Gatsby) is provided
to an LLM alongside literary criticism with a missing quotation from that work.
This setting, in which the model must generate the missing quotation, mirrors
the human process of literary analysis by requiring models to perform both
global narrative reasoning and close textual examination. We curate a
high-quality subset of 292 examples through extensive filtering and human
verification. Our experiments show that recent reasoning models, such as Gemini
Pro 2.5 can exceed human expert performance (62.5% vs. 50% accuracy). In
contrast, the best open-weight model achieves only 29.1% accuracy, highlighting
a wide gap in interpretive reasoning between open and closed-weight models.
Despite their speed and apparent accuracy, even the strongest models struggle
with nuanced literary signals and overgeneration, signaling open challenges for
applying LLMs to literary analysis. We release our dataset and evaluation code
to encourage future work in this direction.

Motivation: 当前缺乏可靠且易用的分词器评估方法，而分词器选择对语言模型性能影响显著。

Method: 利用小模型预测分词器对大模型的影响，并基于Zipf定律设计新的内在评估指标。

Result: 英语任务中分词器影响较小，但多语言任务中差异显著；新指标与下游性能相关性更强。

Conclusion: 提出了一种高效的分词器评估框架，为未来语言模型开发提供了更明智的选择路径。

Abstract: The choice of tokenizer can profoundly impact language model performance, yet
accessible and reliable evaluations of tokenizer quality remain an open
challenge. Inspired by scaling consistency, we show that smaller models can
accurately predict significant differences in tokenizer impact on larger models
at a fraction of the compute cost. By systematically evaluating both
English-centric and multilingual tokenizers, we find that tokenizer choice has
negligible effects on tasks in English but results in consistent performance
differences in multilingual settings. We propose new intrinsic tokenizer
metrics inspired by Zipf's law that correlate more strongly with downstream
performance than text compression when modeling unseen languages. By combining
several metrics to capture multiple aspects of tokenizer behavior, we develop a
reliable framework for intrinsic tokenizer evaluations. Our work offers a more
efficient path to informed tokenizer selection in future language model
development.

Motivation: 现有RL方法仅依赖数值反馈，面临性能瓶颈、自反思效果有限和持续失败问题，需改进。

Method: 提出Critique-GRPO框架，整合自然语言反馈与数值反馈，支持模型同时学习初始响应和基于反馈的改进。

Result: 实验显示Critique-GRPO在多项任务中优于监督学习和RL方法，平均pass@1分数提升4.5%-5%。

Conclusion: 自然语言反馈能有效突破RL瓶颈，Critique-GRPO为优化LLM学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) with numerical feedback, such
as scalar rewards, have significantly enhanced the complex reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite this success, we identify
three key challenges encountered by RL with solely numerical feedback:
performance plateaus, limited effectiveness of self-reflection, and persistent
failures. We then demonstrate that RL-finetuned models, even after exhibiting
performance plateaus, can generate correct refinements on persistently failed
problems by leveraging natural language feedback in the form of critiques.
Building on this insight, we propose Critique-GRPO, an online RL framework that
integrates both natural language and numerical feedback for effective policy
optimization. Critique-GRPO enables LLMs to learn from initial responses and
critique-guided refinements simultaneously while maintaining exploration.
Extensive experiments using Qwen2.5-7B-Base and Qwen3-8B-Base show that
Critique-GRPO consistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based
fine-tuning approaches across eight challenging mathematical, STEM, and general
reasoning tasks, improving average pass@1 scores by approximately 4.5% and 5%,
respectively. Notably, Critique-GRPO surpasses a strong baseline that
incorporates expert demonstrations within online RL. Further analysis reveals
two critical insights about policy exploration: (1) higher entropy does not
always guarantee efficient learning from exploration, and (2) longer responses
do not necessarily lead to more effective exploration.

Method: 框架分两阶段：1) LLM通过指令调优生成电路拓扑；2) 强化学习进一步优化模型，使用奖励模型评估有效性、效率和输出电压。

Result: AUTOCIRCUIT-RL生成的有效电路比基线多12%，效率提升14%，重复生成率降低38%，训练数据有限时成功率超60%。

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂电路设计中表现出高效性和强泛化能力，标志着AI驱动电路设计的重大进展。

Abstract: Analog circuit topology synthesis is integral to Electronic Design Automation
(EDA), enabling the automated creation of circuit structures tailored to
specific design requirements. However, the vast design search space and strict
constraint adherence make efficient synthesis challenging. Leveraging the
versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose AUTOCIRCUIT-RL,a novel
reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for automated analog circuit
synthesis. The framework operates in two phases: instruction tuning, where an
LLM learns to generate circuit topologies from structured prompts encoding
design constraints, and RL refinement, which further improves the
instruction-tuned model using reward models that evaluate validity, efficiency,
and output voltage. The refined model is then used directly to generate
topologies that satisfy the design constraints. Empirical results show that
AUTOCIRCUIT-RL generates ~12% more valid circuits and improves efficiency by
~14% compared to the best baselines, while reducing duplicate generation rates
by ~38%. It achieves over 60% success in synthesizing valid circuits with
limited training data, demonstrating strong generalization. These findings
highlight the framework's effectiveness in scaling to complex circuits while
maintaining efficiency and constraint adherence, marking a significant
advancement in AI-driven circuit design.

Abstract: We propose CURE, a novel reinforcement learning framework with a dedicated

Best-of-N accuracy by 9.0% after optimization on Qwen2.5-Instruct models,
outperforming similarly sized Qwen-Coder, DeepSeek-Coder, and Seed-Coder. They
naturally extend to downstream tasks such as test-time scaling and agentic
coding-achieving a 8.1% improvement over the base model. For the long-CoT
model, our ReasonFlux-Coder-4B consistently outperforms Qwen3-4B while
achieving 64.8% inference efficiency in unit test generation. Notably, we also

Result: 在多个基准测试中超越现有方法，泛化能力更强，7B模型性能优于72B模型。

Conclusion: GUI-Actor无需微调VLM主干即可实现高效定位，保留通用性。

Abstract: One of the principal challenges in building VLM-powered GUI agents is visual
grounding, i.e., localizing the appropriate screen region for action execution
based on both the visual content and the textual plans. Most existing work
formulates this as a text-based coordinate generation task. However, these
approaches suffer from several limitations: weak spatial-semantic alignment,
inability to handle ambiguous supervision targets, and a mismatch between the
dense nature of screen coordinates and the coarse, patch-level granularity of
visual features extracted by models like Vision Transformers. In this paper, we
propose GUI-Actor, a VLM-based method for coordinate-free GUI grounding. At its
core, GUI-Actor introduces an attention-based action head that learns to align
a dedicated <ACTOR> token with all relevant visual patch tokens, enabling the
model to propose one or more action regions in a single forward pass. In line
with this, we further design a grounding verifier to evaluate and select the
most plausible action region from the candidates proposed for action execution.
Extensive experiments show that GUI-Actor outperforms prior state-of-the-art
methods on multiple GUI action grounding benchmarks, with improved
generalization to unseen screen resolutions and layouts. Notably, GUI-Actor-7B
even surpasses UI-TARS-72B (38.1) on ScreenSpot-Pro, achieving scores of 40.7
with Qwen2-VL and 44.6 with Qwen2.5-VL as backbones. Furthermore, by
incorporating the verifier, we find that fine-tuning only the newly introduced
action head (~100M parameters for 7B model) while keeping the VLM backbone
frozen is sufficient to achieve performance comparable to previous
state-of-the-art models, highlighting that GUI-Actor can endow the underlying
VLM with effective grounding capabilities without compromising its
general-purpose strengths.

Abstract: Neuroscience research publications encompass a vast wealth of knowledge.
Accurately retrieving existing information and discovering new insights from
this extensive literature is essential for advancing the field. However, when
knowledge is dispersed across multiple sources, current state-of-the-art
retrieval methods often struggle to extract the necessary information. A
knowledge graph (KG) can integrate and link knowledge from multiple sources,
but existing methods for constructing KGs in neuroscience often rely on labeled
data and require domain expertise. Acquiring large-scale, labeled data for a
specialized area like neuroscience presents significant challenges. This work
proposes novel methods for constructing KG from unlabeled large-scale
neuroscience research corpus utilizing large language models (LLM),
neuroscience ontology, and text embeddings. We analyze the semantic relevance
of neuroscience text segments identified by LLM for building the knowledge
graph. We also introduce an entity-augmented information retrieval algorithm to
extract knowledge from the KG. Several experiments were conducted to evaluate
the proposed approaches, and the results demonstrate that our methods
significantly enhance knowledge discovery from the unlabeled neuroscience
research corpus. It achieves an F1 score of 0.84 for entity extraction, and the
knowledge obtained from the KG improves answers to over 54% of the questions.

TL;DR: 论文研究了语言模型中分词器对字符序列概率的影响，提出了一种量化分词偏差的方法，并发现分词选择对模型输出有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型通常基于子词序列训练，但最终定义的是字符序列的概率。分词器的选择（将字符序列映射到子词）理论上不应影响字符序列的概率，但实际上存在偏差。本文旨在量化这种分词偏差。

Method: 通过将分词偏差定义为因果效应，并利用回归不连续设计进行估计。具体方法是利用分词算法对子词排序并选择前K个作为词汇表，通过比较临界点附近的子词来估计因果效应。

Result: 实验发现分词对模型输出有显著影响，且在不同规模、词汇量和分词器中表现一致。例如，子词出现在小模型词汇表中可能使其字符概率增加高达17倍。

Conclusion: 分词是语言模型设计中的关键选择，其偏差对模型输出有显著影响。

Abstract: Modern language models are typically trained over subword sequences, but
ultimately define probabilities over character-strings. Ideally, the choice of
the tokeniser -- which maps character-strings to subwords -- should not affect
the probability assigned to the underlying character-string; in practice, it
does. We define this mismatch as tokenisation bias. In this work, we quantify
one particular type of tokenisation bias: the effect of including or not a
subword (e.g., $\langle hello \rangle$) in a tokeniser's vocabulary on the
probability a trained model assigns to the corresponding characters (i.e.,
\textit{``hello''}). Estimating this effect is challenging because each model
is trained with only one tokeniser. We address this by framing tokenisation
bias as a causal effect and estimating it using the regression discontinuity
design. Specifically, we exploit the fact that tokenisation algorithms rank
subwords and add the first $K$ to a tokeniser's vocabulary, where $K$ is an
arbitrary cutoff point. As such, we can estimate a causal effect by comparing
similar subwords around this cutoff. Experimentally, we find that tokenisation
consistently affects models' outputs across scales, vocabularies, and
tokenisers. Notably, a subword's presence in a small model's vocabulary may
increase its characters' probability by up to 17 times, highlighting
tokenisation as a key design choice in language modelling.

Abstract: This paper presents the second Chinese Continuous Visual Speech Recognition
Challenge (CNVSRC 2024), which builds on CNVSRC 2023 to advance research in
Chinese Large Vocabulary Continuous Visual Speech Recognition (LVC-VSR). The
challenge evaluates two test scenarios: reading in recording studios and
Internet speech. CNVSRC 2024 uses the same datasets as its predecessor CNVSRC
2023, which involves CN-CVS for training and CNVSRC-Single/Multi for
development and evaluation. However, CNVSRC 2024 introduced two key
improvements: (1) a stronger baseline system, and (2) an additional dataset,
CN-CVS2-P1, for open tracks to improve data volume and diversity. The new
challenge has demonstrated several important innovations in data preprocessing,
feature extraction, model design, and training strategies, further pushing the
state-of-the-art in Chinese LVC-VSR. More details and resources are available

### [109] [OASIS: Online Sample Selection for Continual Visual Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02011)
*Minjae Lee,Minhyuk Seo,Tingyu Qu,Tinne Tuytelaars,Jonghyun Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OASIS是一种自适应在线样本选择方法，用于持续视觉指令调整（CVIT），动态调整每批样本数量以减少冗余并适应分布变化，仅需25%数据即可达到全数据训练性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在CVIT场景中，多模态数据持续在线到达，大规模数据导致训练延迟，现有方法依赖预训练参考模型或固定样本选择策略，无法适应未知未来数据或批次间信息量变化。

Method: 提出OASIS方法：1）基于批次间相对信息量动态调整样本选择数量；2）通过迭代更新选择分数最小化冗余。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5和Qwen-VL-2.5等MLLMs上，OASIS仅用25%数据即达到全数据训练性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OASIS解决了CVIT中的样本选择问题，显著提升效率与适应性。

Abstract: In continual visual instruction tuning (CVIT) scenarios, where multi-modal
data continuously arrive in an online streaming manner, training delays from
large-scale data significantly hinder real-time adaptation. While existing data
selection strategies reduce training overheads, they rely on pre-trained
reference models, which are impractical in CVIT setups due to unknown future
data. Recent reference model-free online sample selection methods address this
issue but typically select a fixed number of samples per batch (e.g., top-k),
causing them to suffer from distribution shifts where informativeness varies
across batches. To address these limitations, we propose OASIS, an adaptive
online sample selection approach for CVIT that: (1) dynamically adjusts
selected samples per batch based on relative inter-batch informativeness, and
(2) minimizes redundancy of selected samples through iterative selection score
updates. Empirical results across various MLLMs, such as LLaVA-1.5 and
Qwen-VL-2.5, show that OASIS achieves comparable performance to full-data
training using only 25% of the data and outperforms the state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: LLMs在VSR任务中具有巨大潜力，通过系统优化可进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) transcribes speech by analyzing lip
movements. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been integrated into VSR
systems, leading to notable performance improvements. However, the potential of
LLMs has not been extensively studied, and how to effectively utilize LLMs in
VSR tasks remains unexplored. This paper systematically explores how to better
leverage LLMs for VSR tasks and provides three key contributions: (1) Scaling
Test: We study how the LLM size affects VSR performance, confirming a scaling
law in the VSR task. (2) Context-Aware Decoding: We add contextual text to
guide the LLM decoding, improving recognition accuracy. (3) Iterative
Polishing: We propose iteratively refining LLM outputs, progressively reducing
recognition errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by these designs,
the great potential of LLMs can be largely harnessed, leading to significant
VSR performance improvement.

Abstract: With the advancement of autonomous and assisted driving technologies, higher
demands are placed on the ability to understand complex driving scenarios.
Multimodal general large models have emerged as a solution for this challenge.
However, applying these models in vertical domains involves difficulties such
as data collection, model training, and deployment optimization. This paper
proposes a comprehensive method for optimizing multimodal models in driving
scenarios, including cone detection, traffic light recognition, speed limit
recommendation, and intersection alerts. The method covers key aspects such as
dynamic prompt optimization, dataset construction, model training, and
deployment. Specifically, the dynamic prompt optimization adjusts the prompts
based on the input image content to focus on objects affecting the ego vehicle,
enhancing the model's task-specific focus and judgment capabilities. The
dataset is constructed by combining real and synthetic data to create a
high-quality and diverse multimodal training dataset, improving the model's
generalization in complex driving environments. In model training, advanced
techniques like knowledge distillation, dynamic fine-tuning, and quantization
are integrated to reduce storage and computational costs while boosting
performance. Experimental results show that this systematic optimization method
not only significantly improves the model's accuracy in key tasks but also
achieves efficient resource utilization, providing strong support for the
practical application of driving scenario perception technologies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为OSPO的框架，用于改进多模态大语言模型在文本到图像生成任务中的细粒度视觉理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型在图像理解和生成方面取得了进展，但在细粒度视觉理解（尤其是文本到图像生成任务）上仍存在不足。偏好优化方法在图像理解任务中有所应用，但在图像生成领域尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出了OSPO框架，利用多模态大语言模型的内在推理能力，无需外部数据集或模型。通过对象级对比偏好对的自构建机制（包括对象中心提示扰动、密集化和VQA评分）来生成高质量偏好对。

Result: 在三个代表性的文本到图像生成基准测试中验证了OSPO，结果显示其性能显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: OSPO通过自改进机制有效提升了文本到图像生成任务的性能，填补了偏好优化在图像生成领域的空白。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved both image understanding and generation capabilities.
Despite these improvements, MLLMs still struggle with fine-grained visual
comprehension, particularly in text-to-image generation tasks. While preference
optimization methods have been explored to address these limitations in image
understanding tasks, their application to image generation remains largely
underexplored. To address this gap, we propose an Object-centric Self-improving
Preference Optimization (OSPO) framework designed for text-to-image generation
by MLLMs. OSPO leverages the intrinsic reasoning abilities of MLLMs without
requiring any external datasets or models. OSPO emphasizes the importance of
high-quality preference pair data, which is critical for effective preference
optimization. To achieve this, it introduces a self-improving mechanism that
autonomously constructs object-level contrastive preference pairs through
object-centric prompt perturbation, densification and VQA scoring. This process
eliminates ambiguous or disproportionate variations commonly found in naively
generated preference pairs, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of preference
optimization. We validate OSPO on three representative compositional
text-to-image benchmarks, demonstrating substantial performance gains over
baseline models.

*Nuolin Sun,Linyuan Wang,Dongyang Li,Bin Yan,Lei Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于层间特征路径相关性的对抗样本检测与图像识别方法，避免了计算开销大的对抗训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DNN对抗鲁棒性弱，对抗训练计算成本高，需探索更高效的方法。

Method: 利用层间特征构建特征路径，计算其与类中心特征路径的相关性。

Result: 在ResNet-20上，干净准确率82.77%，对抗准确率44.17%；ResNet-18上分别为80.01%和46.1%。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了DNN固有的对抗鲁棒性，挑战了传统认知。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks have received increasing attention and it has been widely
recognized that classical DNNs have weak adversarial robustness. The most
commonly used adversarial defense method, adversarial training, improves the
adversarial accuracy of DNNs by generating adversarial examples and retraining
the model. However, adversarial training requires a significant computational
overhead. In this paper, inspired by existing studies focusing on the
clustering properties of DNN output features at each layer and the Progressive
Feedforward Collapse phenomenon, we propose a method for adversarial example
detection and image recognition that uses layer-wise features to construct
feature paths and computes the correlation between the examples feature paths
and the class-centered feature paths. Experimental results show that the
recognition method achieves 82.77% clean accuracy and 44.17% adversarial
accuracy on the ResNet-20 with PFC. Compared to the adversarial training method
with 77.64% clean accuracy and 52.94% adversarial accuracy, our method exhibits
a trade-off without relying on computationally expensive defense strategies.
Furthermore, on the standard ResNet-18, our method maintains this advantage
with respective metrics of 80.01% and 46.1%. This result reveals inherent
adversarial robustness in DNNs, challenging the conventional understanding of
the weak adversarial robustness in DNNs.

### [114] [Fairness through Feedback: Addressing Algorithmic Misgendering in Automatic Gender Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02017)
*Camilla Quaresmini,Giacomo Zanotti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了自动性别识别（AGR）系统的问题，提出理论与实践的重新思考，建议引入用户反馈机制以提高公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AGR系统通常基于性别二元假设，且分类依据与性别表达存在差距，导致对非二元性别者不可靠。

Method: 区分性别、性别表达与性别认同，提出用户可修正系统输出的反馈机制。

Result: 反馈机制虽降低系统自主性，但显著提升公平性，符合尊重个体表达与自决的新范式。

Conclusion: AGR系统应作为尊重个体权利与表达的工具，而非简单分类器。

Abstract: Automatic Gender Recognition (AGR) systems are an increasingly widespread
application in the Machine Learning (ML) landscape. While these systems are
typically understood as detecting gender, they often classify datapoints based
on observable features correlated at best with either male or female sex. In
addition to questionable binary assumptions, from an epistemological point of
view, this is problematic for two reasons. First, there exists a gap between
the categories the system is meant to predict (woman versus man) and those onto
which their output reasonably maps (female versus male). What is more, gender
cannot be inferred on the basis of such observable features. This makes AGR
tools often unreliable, especially in the case of non-binary and gender
non-conforming people. We suggest a theoretical and practical rethinking of AGR
systems. To begin, distinctions are made between sex, gender, and gender
expression. Then, we build upon the observation that, unlike algorithmic
misgendering, human-human misgendering is open to the possibility of
re-evaluation and correction. We suggest that analogous dynamics should be
recreated in AGR, giving users the possibility to correct the system's output.
While implementing such a feedback mechanism could be regarded as diminishing
the system's autonomy, it represents a way to significantly increase fairness
levels in AGR. This is consistent with the conceptual change of paradigm that
we advocate for AGR systems, which should be understood as tools respecting
individuals' rights and capabilities of self-expression and determination.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管硬负样本挖掘在提升对比学习效率方面已有研究，但其具体贡献尚未被深入分析。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过分析info-NCE损失的梯度，提出显式放大硬负样本梯度的方法，并在LLaVA-OneVision-7B架构上实现。

Result: 在MMEB基准测试中达到最优性能，结合自研MLLM（QQMM）后登上MMEB排行榜首位。

Conclusion: 显式梯度放大方法有效提升了多模态嵌入模型的判别能力，为相关研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) in
recent years, the foundational Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)
framework has been successfully extended to MLLMs, enabling more powerful and
universal multi-modal embeddings for a wide range of retrieval tasks. Despite
these developments, the core contrastive learning paradigm remains largely
unchanged from CLIP-style models to MLLMs. Within this framework, the effective
mining of hard negative samples continues to be a critical factor for enhancing
performance. Prior works have introduced both offline and online strategies for
hard negative mining to improve the efficiency of contrastive learning. While
these approaches have led to improved multi-modal embeddings, the specific
contribution of each hard negative sample to the learning process has not been
thoroughly investigated. In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis of the
gradients of the info-NCE loss with respect to the query, positive, and
negative samples, elucidating the role of hard negatives in updating model
parameters. Building upon this analysis, we propose to explicitly amplify the
gradients associated with hard negative samples, thereby encouraging the model
to learn more discriminative embeddings. Our multi-modal embedding model,
trained with the proposed Explicit Gradient Amplifier and based on the
LLaVA-OneVision-7B architecture, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
MMEB benchmark compared to previous methods utilizing the same MLLM backbone.
Furthermore, when integrated with our self-developed MLLM, QQMM, our approach
attains the top rank on the MMEB leaderboard. Code and models are released on
https://github.com/QQ-MM/QQMM-embed.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的动态感知视频蒸馏方法（DAViD），用于优化视频数据集中的时间分辨率，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频数据集中的冗余问题尚未充分研究，现有方法假设所有视频语义的时间冗余一致，限制了效果。

Method: 采用强化学习预测合成视频的最佳时间分辨率，并提出教师循环奖励函数更新策略。

Result: DAViD显著优于现有数据集蒸馏方法，性能大幅提升。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来更高效、语义自适应的视频数据集蒸馏研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: With the rapid development of vision tasks and the scaling on datasets and
models, redundancy reduction in vision datasets has become a key area of
research. To address this issue, dataset distillation (DD) has emerged as a
promising approach to generating highly compact synthetic datasets with
significantly less redundancy while preserving essential information. However,
while DD has been extensively studied for image datasets, DD on video datasets
remains underexplored. Video datasets present unique challenges due to the
presence of temporal information and varying levels of redundancy across
different classes. Existing DD approaches assume a uniform level of temporal
redundancy across all different video semantics, which limits their
effectiveness on video datasets. In this work, we propose Dynamic-Aware Video
Distillation (DAViD), a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to predict the
optimal Temporal Resolution of the synthetic videos. A teacher-in-the-loop
reward function is proposed to update the RL agent policy. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to introduce adaptive temporal resolution
based on video semantics in video dataset distillation. Our approach
significantly outperforms existing DD methods, demonstrating substantial
improvements in performance. This work paves the way for future research on
more efficient and semantic-adaptive video dataset distillation research.

*Aditya Kanade,Tanuja Ganu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs在视觉感知上存在显著缺陷，即使答案正确也可能误解关键视觉元素。研究提出新基准测试，发现MLLMs表现远低于人类，尤其在复杂任务中差距更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示MLLMs在视觉感知上的不足，即使答案正确也可能掩盖视觉错误，亟需系统性评估和改进。

Method: 引入"Do You See Me"基准测试，包含1,758张图像和2,612个问题，覆盖7个子任务，评估MLLMs的视觉能力。

Result: 人类准确率96.49%，而顶级MLLMs平均低于50%，任务复杂度增加时差距更大。失败原因包括视觉注意力分配错误和细节表征不稳定。

Conclusion: MLLMs需提升视觉感知的鲁棒性，基准测试为未来研究提供了工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show reasoning promise, yet their
visual perception is a critical bottleneck. Strikingly, MLLMs can produce
correct answers even while misinterpreting crucial visual elements, masking
these underlying failures. Our preliminary study on a joint
perception-reasoning dataset revealed that for one leading MLLM, 29% of its
correct answers to reasoning questions still exhibited visual perception
errors. To systematically address this, we introduce "Do You See Me", a
scalable benchmark with 1,758 images and 2,612 questions. It spans seven
human-psychology inspired subtasks in 2D and 3D, featuring controllable
complexity to rigorously evaluate MLLM visual skills. Our findings on 3 leading
closed-source and 5 major open-source models reveal a stark deficit: humans
achieve 96.49% accuracy, while top MLLMs average below 50%. This performance
gap widens rapidly with increased task complexity (e.g., from 12% to 45% in the
visual form constancy subtask). Further analysis into the root causes suggests
that failures stem from challenges like misallocated visual attention and the
instability of internal representations for fine-grained details, especially at
or below encoder patch resolution. This underscores an urgent need for MLLMs
with truly robust visual perception. The benchmark dataset, source code and
evaluation scripts are available at https://github.com/microsoft/Do-You-See-Me.

Abstract: Learning alignment between language and vision is a fundamental challenge,
especially as multimodal data becomes increasingly detailed and complex.
Existing methods often rely on collecting human or AI preferences, which can be
costly and time-intensive. We propose an alternative approach that leverages
cycle consistency as a supervisory signal. Given an image and generated text,
we map the text back to image space using a text-to-image model and compute the
similarity between the original image and its reconstruction. Analogously, for
text-to-image generation, we measure the textual similarity between an input
caption and its reconstruction through the cycle. We use the cycle consistency
score to rank candidates and construct a preference dataset of 866K comparison
pairs. The reward model trained on our dataset outperforms state-of-the-art
alignment metrics on detailed captioning, with superior inference-time
scalability when used as a verifier for Best-of-N sampling. Furthermore,
performing DPO and Diffusion DPO using our dataset enhances performance across
a wide range of vision-language tasks and text-to-image generation. Our
dataset, model, and code are at https://cyclereward.github.io

TL;DR: 论文提出新任务“Map and Locate”，结合开放词汇分割与3D重建，并介绍基线方法SAB3R，性能优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一开放词汇分割和3D重建，推动具身AI应用，填补重建、识别与重组的空白。

Method: 基于MASt3R，引入轻量级蒸馏策略，从2D视觉骨干（如CLIP和DINOv2）提取语义特征，增强3D重建能力。

Result: SAB3R在Map and Locate任务中表现优于单独使用MASt3R和CLIP，同时在2D语义分割和3D任务中验证有效性。

Conclusion: SAB3R成功结合开放词汇分割与3D重建，为具身AI提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a new task, Map and Locate, which unifies the traditionally
distinct objectives of open-vocabulary segmentation - detecting and segmenting
object instances based on natural language queries - and 3D reconstruction, the
process of estimating a scene's 3D structure from visual inputs. Specifically,
Map and Locate involves generating a point cloud from an unposed video and
segmenting object instances based on open-vocabulary queries. This task serves
as a critical step toward real-world embodied AI applications and introduces a
practical task that bridges reconstruction, recognition and reorganization. To
tackle this task, we introduce a simple yet effective baseline, which we denote
as SAB3R. Our approach builds upon MASt3R, a recent breakthrough in 3D computer
vision, and incorporates a lightweight distillation strategy. This method
transfers dense, per-pixel semantic features from 2D vision backbones (eg, CLIP
and DINOv2) to enhance MASt3R's capabilities. Without introducing any auxiliary
frozen networks, our model generates per-pixel semantic features and constructs
cohesive point maps in a single forward pass. Compared to separately deploying
MASt3R and CLIP, our unified model, SAB3R, achieves superior performance on the
Map and Locate benchmark. Furthermore, we evaluate SAB3R on both 2D semantic
segmentation and 3D tasks to comprehensively validate its effectiveness.

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is an essential task in
computer-assisted interventions. This problem is particularly relevant to
oncological treatments, where precise image alignment is necessary for tracking
tumor growth, assessing treatment response, and ensuring accurate delivery of
therapies. Recent AI methods can outperform traditional techniques in accuracy
and speed, yet they often produce unreliable deformations that limit their
clinical adoption. In this work, we address this challenge and introduce a
novel implicit registration framework that can predict accurate and reliable
deformations. Our insight is to reformulate image registration as a signal
reconstruction problem: we learn a kernel function that can recover the dense
displacement field from sparse keypoint correspondences. We integrate our
method in a novel hierarchical architecture, and estimate the displacement
field in a coarse-to-fine manner. Our formulation also allows for efficient
refinement at test time, permitting clinicians to easily adjust registrations
when needed. We validate our method on challenging intra-patient thoracic and
abdominal zero-shot registration tasks, using public and internal datasets from
the local University Hospital. Our method not only shows competitive accuracy
to state-of-the-art approaches, but also bridges the generalization gap between
implicit and explicit registration techniques. In particular, our method
generates deformations that better preserve anatomical relationships and
matches the performance of specialized commercial systems, underscoring its
potential for clinical adoption.

Abstract: The rapid advancements of Text-to-Image (T2I) models have ushered in a new
phase of AI-generated content, marked by their growing ability to interpret and
follow user instructions. However, existing T2I model evaluation benchmarks
fall short in limited prompt diversity and complexity, as well as coarse
evaluation metrics, making it difficult to evaluate the fine-grained alignment
performance between textual instructions and generated images. In this paper,
we present TIIF-Bench (Text-to-Image Instruction Following Benchmark), aiming
to systematically assess T2I models' ability in interpreting and following
intricate textual instructions. TIIF-Bench comprises a set of 5000 prompts
organized along multiple dimensions, which are categorized into three levels of
difficulties and complexities. To rigorously evaluate model robustness to
varying prompt lengths, we provide a short and a long version for each prompt
with identical core semantics. Two critical attributes, i.e., text rendering
and style control, are introduced to evaluate the precision of text synthesis
and the aesthetic coherence of T2I models. In addition, we collect 100
high-quality designer level prompts that encompass various scenarios to
comprehensively assess model performance. Leveraging the world knowledge
encoded in large vision language models, we propose a novel computable
framework to discern subtle variations in T2I model outputs. Through meticulous
benchmarking of mainstream T2I models on TIIF-Bench, we analyze the pros and
cons of current T2I models and reveal the limitations of current T2I
benchmarks. Project Page: https://a113n-w3i.github.io/TIIF_Bench/.

Result: 模型间相似性与猴子间相似性相当，但模型与猴子相似性较低且随性能提升而下降；对抗训练和大数据集预训练未显著提高模型与猴子相似性。

Conclusion: 猴子V4/IT与图像分类模型在任务相关表征上存在根本差异，模型训练方式的改进未能缩小这一差距。

Abstract: Previous studies have compared the brain and deep neural networks trained on
image classification. Intriguingly, while some suggest that their
representations are highly similar, others argued the opposite. Here, we
propose a new approach to characterize the similarity of the decision
strategies of two observers (models or brains) using decision variable
correlation (DVC). DVC quantifies the correlation between decoded decisions on
individual samples in a classification task and thus can capture task-relevant
information rather than general representational alignment. We evaluate this
method using monkey V4/IT recordings and models trained on image classification
tasks.
  We find that model--model similarity is comparable to monkey--monkey
similarity, whereas model--monkey similarity is consistently lower and,
surprisingly, decreases with increasing ImageNet-1k performance. While
adversarial training enhances robustness, it does not improve model--monkey
similarity in task-relevant dimensions; however, it markedly increases
model--model similarity. Similarly, pre-training on larger datasets does not
improve model--monkey similarity. These results suggest a fundamental
divergence between the task-relevant representations in monkey V4/IT and those
learned by models trained on image classification tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fire360是一个用于评估消防场景中感知和推理能力的基准数据集，包含228个360度视频，支持五项任务，旨在提升AI在恶劣环境下的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI系统在可靠性要求高的环境中表现不佳，消防员因情境感知问题受伤的情况频发，因此需要开发更可靠的AI模型。

Method: 数据集包含多样化的消防训练视频，标注了动作、物体位置和退化信息，支持五项任务，包括视觉问答、动作描述等。

Result: 人类专家在TOR任务中表现优异（83.5%），而GPT-4o等模型表现较差，显示出在退化条件下的推理缺陷。

Conclusion: 通过发布Fire360数据集和评估套件，旨在推动AI在不确定环境下的感知、记忆和推理能力的发展。

Abstract: Modern AI systems struggle most in environments where reliability is critical
- scenes with smoke, poor visibility, and structural deformation. Each year,
tens of thousands of firefighters are injured on duty, often due to breakdowns
in situational perception. We introduce Fire360, a benchmark for evaluating
perception and reasoning in safety-critical firefighting scenarios. The dataset
includes 228 360-degree videos from professional training sessions under
diverse conditions (e.g., low light, thermal distortion), annotated with action
segments, object locations, and degradation metadata. Fire360 supports five
tasks: Visual Question Answering, Temporal Action Captioning, Object
Localization, Safety-Critical Reasoning, and Transformed Object Retrieval
(TOR). TOR tests whether models can match pristine exemplars to fire-damaged
counterparts in unpaired scenes, evaluating transformation-invariant
recognition. While human experts achieve 83.5% on TOR, models like GPT-4o lag
significantly, exposing failures in reasoning under degradation. By releasing
Fire360 and its evaluation suite, we aim to advance models that not only see,
but also remember, reason, and act under uncertainty. The dataset is available
at: https://uofi.box.com/v/fire360dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diff2Flow框架通过时间步重标定、对齐插值和从扩散预测中导出FM兼容的速度场，将预训练扩散模型知识高效迁移到流匹配（FM），实现直接且高效的FM微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础FM模型在微调时计算成本高，而扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）具有高效架构和生态系统支持。Diff2Flow旨在解决如何高效将扩散模型知识迁移到FM的挑战。

Method: Diff2Flow通过时间步重标定、对齐插值和从扩散预测中导出FM兼容的速度场，系统性地桥接扩散模型与FM范式。

Result: 实验表明，Diff2Flow在参数高效约束下优于朴素FM和扩散微调，并在多样下游任务中达到或超越最先进方法性能。

Conclusion: Diff2Flow为扩散模型与FM之间的知识迁移提供了高效解决方案，代码将开源。

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized generative tasks through high-fidelity
outputs, yet flow matching (FM) offers faster inference and empirical
performance gains. However, current foundation FM models are computationally
prohibitive for finetuning, while diffusion models like Stable Diffusion
benefit from efficient architectures and ecosystem support. This work addresses
the critical challenge of efficiently transferring knowledge from pre-trained
diffusion models to flow matching. We propose Diff2Flow, a novel framework that
systematically bridges diffusion and FM paradigms by rescaling timesteps,
aligning interpolants, and deriving FM-compatible velocity fields from
diffusion predictions. This alignment enables direct and efficient FM
finetuning of diffusion priors with no extra computation overhead. Our
experiments demonstrate that Diff2Flow outperforms na\"ive FM and diffusion
finetuning particularly under parameter-efficient constraints, while achieving
superior or competitive performance across diverse downstream tasks compared to
state-of-the-art methods. We will release our code at
https://github.com/CompVis/diff2flow.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种改进视觉-语言对比学习框架的方法，以提高胎盘病理检测的准确性和效率，包括文本锚定的知识蒸馏和无监督预蒸馏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有胎盘病理自动检测方法计算量大，限制了其实际应用，需提升效率和准确性。

Method: 1. 文本锚定的视觉-语言对比知识蒸馏（VLCD）；2. 使用自然图像数据集进行无监督预蒸馏。

Result: 改进后的模型性能优于或匹配教师模型，同时实现模型压缩和加速，尤其对低质量图像表现更鲁棒。

Conclusion: VLCD提高了医疗视觉-语言对比学习方法的效率和可部署性，尤其适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Pathological examination of the placenta is an effective method for detecting
and mitigating health risks associated with childbirth. Recent advancements in
AI have enabled the use of photographs of the placenta and pathology reports
for detecting and classifying signs of childbirth-related pathologies. However,
existing automated methods are computationally extensive, which limits their
deployability. We propose two modifications to vision-language contrastive
learning (VLC) frameworks to enhance their accuracy and efficiency: (1)
text-anchored vision-language contrastive knowledge distillation (VLCD)-a new
knowledge distillation strategy for medical VLC pretraining, and (2)
unsupervised predistillation using a large natural images dataset for improved
initialization. Our approach distills efficient neural networks that match or
surpass the teacher model in performance while achieving model compression and
acceleration. Our results showcase the value of unsupervised predistillation in
improving the performance and robustness of our approach, specifically for
lower-quality images. VLCD serves as an effective way to improve the efficiency
and deployability of medical VLC approaches, making AI-based healthcare
solutions more accessible, especially in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于物理的频率域方法，用于提升扩散视频生成的物理合理性。通过分析不同物理运动的频率特性，设计了物理运动损失函数和频率域增强模块，显著提升了生成视频的运动质量和物理合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散视频生成方法主要依赖统计学习，未显式建模运动的物理特性，导致生成视频存在非物理伪影。本文旨在通过频率域方法增强物理合理性。

Method: 1. 分析物理运动的频率特性；2. 提出物理运动损失函数；3. 设计频率域增强模块，通过零初始化策略调整视频特征。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了运动质量和物理合理性，且不影响视觉质量或语义对齐。

Conclusion: 该框架为深度学习视频合成提供了物理约束的通用方法，连接了数据驱动模型与物理运动模型。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have yielded
unprecedented quality in visual content and semantic coherence. However,
current approaches predominantly rely on statistical learning from vast
datasets without explicitly modeling the underlying physics of motion,
resulting in subtle yet perceptible non-physical artifacts that diminish the
realism of generated videos. This paper introduces a physics-informed frequency
domain approach to enhance the physical plausibility of generated videos. We
first conduct a systematic analysis of the frequency-domain characteristics of
diverse physical motions (translation, rotation, scaling), revealing that each
motion type exhibits distinctive and identifiable spectral signatures. Building
on this theoretical foundation, we propose two complementary components: (1) a
physical motion loss function that quantifies and optimizes the conformity of
generated videos to ideal frequency-domain motion patterns, and (2) a frequency
domain enhancement module that progressively learns to adjust video features to
conform to physical motion constraints while preserving original network
functionality through a zero-initialization strategy. Experiments across
multiple video diffusion architectures demonstrate that our approach
significantly enhances motion quality and physical plausibility without
compromising visual quality or semantic alignment. Our frequency-domain
physical motion framework generalizes effectively across different video
generation architectures, offering a principled approach to incorporating
physical constraints into deep learning-based video synthesis pipelines. This
work seeks to establish connections between data-driven models and
physics-based motion models.

Motivation: 解决传统视觉方法在非稳定视角、运动模糊和屏幕外语音等现实条件下性能下降的问题。

Method: 整合部分冻结的Whisper音频编码器和微调的AV-HuBERT视觉骨干，引入跨模态对齐损失以平衡模态。

Result: 在Ego4D ASD基准上达到76.6% mAP，优于LoCoNet和STHG。

Conclusion: 预训练音频先验和对齐融合方法在现实场景中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Active speaker detection (ASD) in egocentric videos presents unique
challenges due to unstable viewpoints, motion blur, and off-screen speech
sources - conditions under which traditional visual-centric methods degrade
significantly. We introduce PAIR-Net (Pretrained Audio-Visual Integration with
Regularization Network), an effective model that integrates a partially frozen
Whisper audio encoder with a fine-tuned AV-HuBERT visual backbone to robustly
fuse cross-modal cues. To counteract modality imbalance, we introduce an
inter-modal alignment loss that synchronizes audio and visual representations,
enabling more consistent convergence across modalities. Without relying on
multi-speaker context or ideal frontal views, PAIR-Net achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Ego4D ASD benchmark with 76.6% mAP,
surpassing LoCoNet and STHG by 8.2% and 12.9% mAP, respectively. Our results
highlight the value of pretrained audio priors and alignment-based fusion for
robust ASD under real-world egocentric conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rig3R是一种改进的多视角3D重建模型，通过结合或推断相机设备结构，显著提升了3D重建、相机姿态估计和设备结构发现的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如DUSt3R）将图像视为无结构集合，限制了在同步设备场景中的效果。Rig3R旨在利用或推断设备结构以提升性能。

Method: Rig3R结合设备元数据（如相机ID、时间、姿态）构建设备感知的潜在空间，并联合预测点图和两种射线图（全局和设备中心）。

Result: Rig3R在3D重建、相机姿态估计和设备发现任务中表现最优，性能提升17-45% mAA。

Conclusion: Rig3R通过设备感知设计，无需后处理即可实现高效且鲁棒的多视角重建。

Abstract: Estimating agent pose and 3D scene structure from multi-camera rigs is a
central task in embodied AI applications such as autonomous driving. Recent
learned approaches such as DUSt3R have shown impressive performance in
multiview settings. However, these models treat images as unstructured
collections, limiting effectiveness in scenarios where frames are captured from
synchronized rigs with known or inferable structure.
  To this end, we introduce Rig3R, a generalization of prior multiview
reconstruction models that incorporates rig structure when available, and
learns to infer it when not. Rig3R conditions on optional rig metadata
including camera ID, time, and rig poses to develop a rig-aware latent space
that remains robust to missing information. It jointly predicts pointmaps and
two types of raymaps: a pose raymap relative to a global frame, and a rig
raymap relative to a rig-centric frame consistent across time. Rig raymaps
allow the model to infer rig structure directly from input images when metadata
is missing.
  Rig3R achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D reconstruction, camera pose
estimation, and rig discovery, outperforming both traditional and learned
methods by 17-45% mAA across diverse real-world rig datasets, all in a single
forward pass without post-processing or iterative refinement.

Abstract: Despite advances in multimodal learning, challenging benchmarks for
mixed-modal image retrieval that combines visual and textual information are
lacking. This paper introduces a novel benchmark to rigorously evaluate image
retrieval that demands deep cross-modal contextual understanding. We present
two new datasets: the Entity Image Dataset (EI), providing canonical images for
Wikipedia entities, and the Mixed-Modal Image Retrieval Dataset (MMIR), derived
from the WIT dataset. The MMIR benchmark features two challenging query types
requiring models to ground textual descriptions in the context of provided
visual entities: single entity-image queries (one entity image with descriptive
text) and multi-entity-image queries (multiple entity images with relational
text). We empirically validate the benchmark's utility as both a training
corpus and an evaluation set for mixed-modal retrieval. The quality of both
datasets is further affirmed through crowd-sourced human annotations. The
datasets are accessible through the GitHub page:

Result: 在CelebA、SpuCo Birds和虚假ImageNet上显著提升了最差组和平均组准确率，以及虚假mAUC。

Conclusion: 该方法在协变量偏移下优于现有扩散数据增强基线，提升了知识蒸馏的效果。

Abstract: Large foundation models trained on extensive datasets demonstrate strong
zero-shot capabilities in various domains. To replicate their success when data
and model size are constrained, knowledge distillation has become an
established tool for transferring knowledge from foundation models to small
student networks. However, the effectiveness of distillation is critically
limited by the available training data. This work addresses the common
practical issue of covariate shift in knowledge distillation, where spurious
features appear during training but not at test time. We ask the question: when
these spurious features are unknown, yet a robust teacher is available, is it
possible for a student to also become robust to them? We address this problem
by introducing a novel diffusion-based data augmentation strategy that
generates images by maximizing the disagreement between the teacher and the
student, effectively creating challenging samples that the student struggles
with. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves worst
group and mean group accuracy on CelebA and SpuCo Birds as well as the spurious
mAUC on spurious ImageNet under covariate shift, outperforming state-of-the-art
diffusion-based data augmentation baselines

Abstract: Providing effective treatment and making informed clinical decisions are
essential goals of modern medicine and clinical care. We are interested in
simulating disease dynamics for clinical decision-making, leveraging recent
advances in large generative models. To this end, we introduce the Medical
World Model (MeWM), the first world model in medicine that visually predicts
future disease states based on clinical decisions. MeWM comprises (i)
vision-language models to serve as policy models, and (ii) tumor generative
models as dynamics models. The policy model generates action plans, such as
clinical treatments, while the dynamics model simulates tumor progression or
regression under given treatment conditions. Building on this, we propose the
inverse dynamics model that applies survival analysis to the simulated
post-treatment tumor, enabling the evaluation of treatment efficacy and the
selection of the optimal clinical action plan. As a result, the proposed MeWM
simulates disease dynamics by synthesizing post-treatment tumors, with
state-of-the-art specificity in Turing tests evaluated by radiologists.
Simultaneously, its inverse dynamics model outperforms medical-specialized GPTs
in optimizing individualized treatment protocols across all metrics. Notably,
MeWM improves clinical decision-making for interventional physicians, boosting
F1-score in selecting the optimal TACE protocol by 13%, paving the way for
future integration of medical world models as the second readers.

Motivation: 现有参数化方法在广义类别发现（GCD）中因不可靠的自监督导致基础类识别性能较差，需要一种更有效的方法来提升分类效果。

Method: 提出互学习框架（RLF），包含主分支和辅助分支，通过相互提供伪标签和软标签优化学习；引入类分布正则化（CDR）减少对基础类的学习偏差。

Result: RLCD方法在七个GCD数据集上表现优异，显著提升了所有类别的性能，且计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: RLF和CDR的结合有效解决了GCD中的基础类识别问题，为参数化方法提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify unlabeled samples by
leveraging the base knowledge from labeled ones, where the unlabeled set
consists of both base and novel classes. Since clustering methods are
time-consuming at inference, parametric-based approaches have become more
popular. However, recent parametric-based methods suffer from inferior base
discrimination due to unreliable self-supervision. To address this issue, we
propose a Reciprocal Learning Framework (RLF) that introduces an auxiliary
branch devoted to base classification. During training, the main branch filters
the pseudo-base samples to the auxiliary branch. In response, the auxiliary
branch provides more reliable soft labels for the main branch, leading to a
virtuous cycle. Furthermore, we introduce Class-wise Distribution
Regularization (CDR) to mitigate the learning bias towards base classes. CDR
essentially increases the prediction confidence of the unlabeled data and
boosts the novel class performance. Combined with both components, our proposed
method, RLCD, achieves superior performance in all classes with negligible
extra computation. Comprehensive experiments across seven GCD datasets validate
its superiority. Our codes are available at https://github.com/APORduo/RLCD.

Abstract: Object Navigation (ObjectNav) is a fundamental task in embodied artificial
intelligence. Although significant progress has been made in semantic map
construction and target direction prediction in current research, redundant
exploration and exploration failures remain inevitable. A critical but
underexplored direction is the timely termination of exploration to overcome
these challenges. We observe a diminishing marginal effect between exploration
steps and exploration rates and analyze the cost-benefit relationship of
exploration. Inspired by this, we propose RATE-Nav, a Region-Aware
Termination-Enhanced method. It includes a geometric predictive region
segmentation algorithm and region-Based exploration estimation algorithm for
exploration rate calculation. By leveraging the visual question answering
capabilities of visual language models (VLMs) and exploration rates enables
efficient termination.RATE-Nav achieves a success rate of 67.8% and an SPL of
31.3% on the HM3D dataset. And on the more challenging MP3D dataset, RATE-Nav
shows approximately 10% improvement over previous zero-shot methods.

Motivation: 现有视频对象分割方法多关注单一目标，忽略了对象间的交互关系，而交互在视频理解中至关重要。

Method: 提出InterRVOS任务，构建InterRVOS-8K数据集，设计ReVIOSa模型处理交互感知的分割。

Result: 实验表明，ReVIOSa在复杂对象交互建模上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: InterRVOS为交互中心视频理解研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Referring video object segmentation aims to segment the object in a video
corresponding to a given natural language expression. While prior works have
explored various referring scenarios, including motion-centric or
multi-instance expressions, most approaches still focus on localizing a single
target object in isolation. However, in comprehensive video understanding, an
object's role is often defined by its interactions with other entities, which
are largely overlooked in existing datasets and models. In this work, we
introduce Interaction-aware referring video object sgementation (InterRVOS), a
new task that requires segmenting both actor and target entities involved in an
interaction. Each interactoin is described through a pair of complementary
expressions from different semantic perspectives, enabling fine-grained
modeling of inter-object relationships. To tackle this task, we propose
InterRVOS-8K, the large-scale and automatically constructed dataset containing
diverse interaction-aware expressions with corresponding masks, including
challenging cases such as motion-only multi-instance expressions. We also
present a baseline architecture, ReVIOSa, designed to handle actor-target
segmentation from a single expression, achieving strong performance in both
standard and interaction-focused settings. Furthermore, we introduce an
actor-target-aware evalaution setting that enables a more targeted assessment
of interaction understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach outperforms prior methods in modeling complex object interactions for
referring video object segmentation task, establishing a strong foundation for
future research in interaction-centric video understanding. Our project page is

Abstract: The classification of the type of road surface (RSC) aims to utilize pavement
features to identify the roughness, wet and dry conditions, and material
information of the road surface. Due to its ability to effectively enhance road
safety and traffic management, it has received widespread attention in recent
years. In autonomous driving, accurate RSC allows vehicles to better understand
the road environment, adjust driving strategies, and ensure a safer and more
efficient driving experience. For a long time, vision-based RSC has been
favored. However, existing visual classification methods have overlooked the
exploration of fine-grained classification of pavement types (such as similar
pavement textures). In this work, we propose a pure vision-based fine-grained
RSC method for autonomous driving scenarios, which fuses local and global
feature information through the stacking of convolutional and transformer
modules. We further explore the stacking strategies of local and global feature
extraction modules to find the optimal feature extraction strategy. In
addition, since fine-grained tasks also face the challenge of relatively large
intra-class differences and relatively small inter-class differences, we
propose a Foreground-Background Module (FBM) that effectively extracts
fine-grained context features of the pavement, enhancing the classification
ability for complex pavements. Experiments conducted on a large-scale pavement
dataset containing one million samples and a simplified dataset reorganized
from this dataset achieved Top-1 classification accuracies of 92.52% and
96.50%, respectively, improving by 5.69% to 12.84% compared to SOTA methods.
These results demonstrate that RoadFormer outperforms existing methods in RSC
tasks, providing significant progress in improving the reliability of pavement
perception in autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: 该方法为传统标注的可行替代方案，兼具高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Great labels make great models. However, traditional labeling approaches for
tasks like object detection have substantial costs at scale. Furthermore,
alternatives to fully-supervised object detection either lose functionality or
require larger models with prohibitive computational costs for inference at
scale. To that end, this paper addresses the problem of training standard
object detection models without any ground truth labels. Instead, we configure
previously-trained vision-language foundation models to generate
application-specific pseudo "ground truth" labels. These auto-generated labels
directly integrate with existing model training frameworks, and we subsequently
train lightweight detection models that are computationally efficient. In this
way, we avoid the costs of traditional labeling, leverage the knowledge of
vision-language models, and keep the efficiency of lightweight models for
practical application. We perform exhaustive experiments across multiple
labeling configurations, downstream inference models, and datasets to establish
best practices and set an extensive auto-labeling benchmark. From our results,
we find that our approach is a viable alternative to standard labeling in that
it maintains competitive performance on multiple datasets and substantially
reduces labeling time and costs.

### [138] [A TRPCA-Inspired Deep Unfolding Network for Hyperspectral Image Denoising via Thresholded t-SVD and Top-K Sparse Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02364)
*Liang Li,Jianli Zhao,Sheng Fang,Siyu Chen,Hui Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于张量鲁棒主成分分析（TRPCA）的深度展开网络（DU-TRPCA），用于高光谱图像去噪，通过紧密耦合的低秩和稀疏模块实现高效噪声去除。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像（HSIs）在采集和传输过程中常受复杂混合噪声影响，现有混合方法未能有效交替利用不同先验或模块，导致正则化松散且互补优势未充分发挥。

Method: 结合低秩模块（阈值张量奇异值分解）和稀疏模块（Top-K稀疏变换器），通过深度展开网络实现紧密耦合的交替优化。

Result: 在合成和真实HSIs上的实验表明，DU-TRPCA在严重混合噪声下优于现有方法，同时提供可解释性和稳定的去噪动态。

Conclusion: DU-TRPCA通过紧密耦合的低秩和稀疏模块，有效提升了高光谱图像去噪性能，同时保留了TRPCA的迭代优化特性。

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSIs) are often degraded by complex mixed noise during
acquisition and transmission, making effective denoising essential for
subsequent analysis. Recent hybrid approaches that bridge model-driven and
data-driven paradigms have shown great promise. However, most of these
approaches lack effective alternation between different priors or modules,
resulting in loosely coupled regularization and insufficient exploitation of
their complementary strengths. Inspired by tensor robust principal component
analysis (TRPCA), we propose a novel deep unfolding network (DU-TRPCA) that
enforces stage-wise alternation between two tightly integrated modules:
low-rank and sparse. The low-rank module employs thresholded tensor singular
value decomposition (t-SVD), providing a widely adopted convex surrogate for
tensor low-rankness and has been demonstrated to effectively capture the global
spatial-spectral structure of HSIs. The Top-K sparse transformer module
adaptively imposes sparse constraints, directly matching the sparse
regularization in TRPCA and enabling effective removal of localized outliers
and complex noise. This tightly coupled architecture preserves the stage-wise
alternation between low-rank approximation and sparse refinement inherent in
TRPCA, while enhancing representational capacity through attention mechanisms.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world HSIs demonstrate that
DU-TRPCA surpasses state-of-the-art methods under severe mixed noise, while
offering interpretability benefits and stable denoising dynamics inspired by
iterative optimization. Code is available at

Conclusion: GBABS是一种通用采样方法，有效解决了边界采样和噪声数据集问题，为分类任务提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Data sampling enhances classifier efficiency and robustness through data
compression and quality improvement. Recently, the sampling method based on
granular-ball (GB) has shown promising performance in generality and noisy
classification tasks. However, some limitations remain, including the absence
of borderline sampling strategies and issues with class boundary blurring or
shrinking due to overlap between GBs. In this paper, an approximate borderline
sampling method using GBs is proposed for classification tasks. First, a
restricted diffusion-based GB generation (RD-GBG) method is proposed, which
prevents GB overlaps by constrained expansion, preserving precise geometric
representation of GBs via redefined ones. Second, based on the concept of
heterogeneous nearest neighbor, a GB-based approximate borderline sampling
(GBABS) method is proposed, which is the first general sampling method capable
of both borderline sampling and improving the quality of class noise datasets.
Additionally, since RD-GBG incorporates noise detection and GBABS focuses on
borderline samples, GBABS performs outstandingly on class noise datasets
without the need for an optimal purity threshold. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the GB-based sampling method
and several representative sampling methods. Our source code is publicly
available at https://github.com/CherylTse/GBABS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ViT的MLP头部训练成本高且未充分利用特征提取器能力，需改进。

Method: 提出静态神经场函数构建NF分类器，分阶段训练特征提取器和分类器。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著超越现有方法，新类和整体类准确率分别提升19%和16%。

Conclusion: ViTNF架构在广义类别发现任务中表现优异，训练更高效。

Abstract: Generalized category discovery (GCD) is a highly popular task in open-world
recognition, aiming to identify unknown class samples using known class data.
By leveraging pre-training, meta-training, and fine-tuning, ViT achieves
excellent few-shot learning capabilities. Its MLP head is a feedforward
network, trained synchronously with the entire network in the same process,
increasing the training cost and difficulty without fully leveraging the power
of the feature extractor. This paper proposes a new architecture by replacing
the MLP head with a neural field-based one. We first present a new static
neural field function to describe the activity distribution of the neural field
and then use two static neural field functions to build an efficient few-shot
classifier. This neural field-based (NF) classifier consists of two coupled
static neural fields. It stores the feature information of support samples by
its elementary field, the known categories by its high-level field, and the
category information of support samples by its cross-field connections. We
replace the MLP head with the proposed NF classifier, resulting in a novel
architecture ViTNF, and simplify the three-stage training mode by pre-training
the feature extractor on source tasks and training the NF classifier with
support samples in meta-testing separately, significantly reducing ViT's demand
for training samples and the difficulty of model training. To enhance the
model's capability in identifying new categories, we provide an effective
algorithm to determine the lateral interaction scale of the elementary field.
Experimental results demonstrate that our model surpasses existing
state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, CUB-200, and Standard
Cars, achieving dramatic accuracy improvements of 19\% and 16\% in new and all
classes, respectively, indicating a notable advantage in GCD.

Result: 在Breakfast、50 Salads和DARai等数据集上，平均预测准确率提升3.08%，达到当前最佳水平。

Conclusion: 多模态和层次化建模在动作预测中具有潜力，为未来研究设立了新基准。

Abstract: Action anticipation, the task of predicting future actions from partially
observed videos, is crucial for advancing intelligent systems. Unlike action
recognition, which operates on fully observed videos, action anticipation must
handle incomplete information. Hence, it requires temporal reasoning, and
inherent uncertainty handling. While recent advances have been made,
traditional methods often focus solely on visual modalities, neglecting the
potential of integrating multiple sources of information. Drawing inspiration
from human behavior, we introduce \textit{Multi-level and Multi-modal Action
Anticipation (m\&m-Ant)}, a novel multi-modal action anticipation approach that
combines both visual and textual cues, while explicitly modeling hierarchical
semantic information for more accurate predictions. To address the challenge of
inaccurate coarse action labels, we propose a fine-grained label generator
paired with a specialized temporal consistency loss function to optimize
performance. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets, including
Breakfast, 50 Salads, and DARai, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
achieving state-of-the-art results with an average anticipation accuracy
improvement of 3.08\% over existing methods. This work underscores the
potential of multi-modal and hierarchical modeling in advancing action
anticipation and establishes a new benchmark for future research in the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外小目标检测因目标小、暗、无固定形状和变化快而具有挑战性，现有CNN方法需要大量特征提取和融合模块。

Method: RRCA-Net通过可重用卷积块（RuCB）循环迭代保持和细化高层信息，并引入双交互注意力聚合模块（DIAAM）增强信息融合。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优异，参数少且可作为插件提升其他方法的性能。

Conclusion: RRCA-Net在红外小目标检测中实现了高效和高性能，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection is a challenging task due to its unique
characteristics (e.g., small, dim, shapeless and changeable). Recently
published CNN-based methods have achieved promising performance with heavy
feature extraction and fusion modules. To achieve efficient and effective
detection, we propose a recurrent reusable-convolution attention network
(RRCA-Net) for infrared small target detection. Specifically, RRCA-Net
incorporates reusable-convolution block (RuCB) in a recurrent manner without
introducing extra parameters. With the help of the repetitive iteration in
RuCB, the high-level information of small targets in the deep layers can be
well maintained and further refined. Then, a dual interactive attention
aggregation module (DIAAM) is proposed to promote the mutual enhancement and
fusion of refined information. In this way, RRCA-Net can both achieve
high-level feature refinement and enhance the correlation of contextual
information between adjacent layers. Moreover, to achieve steady convergence,
we design a target characteristic inspired loss function (DpT-k loss) by
integrating physical and mathematical constraints. Experimental results on
three benchmark datasets (e.g. NUAA-SIRST, IRSTD-1k, DenseSIRST) demonstrate
that our RRCA-Net can achieve comparable performance to the state-of-the-art
methods while maintaining a small number of parameters, and act as a plug and
play module to introduce consistent performance improvement for several popular
IRSTD methods. Our code will be available at https://github.com/yongxianLiu/

Motivation: 现有方法忽略了昼夜亮度关系，且未明确融入白天亮度知识，导致图像合成和光照重建不真实。

Method: 提出数据合成管道模拟失真并保持亮度一致性，结合预训练扩散模型和亮度感知网络进行优化。

Result: 实验验证了数据集的有效性和模型在去雾及亮度映射中的优越性能。

Conclusion: DiffND框架在夜间去雾和亮度重建方面表现出色。

Abstract: While nighttime image dehazing has been extensively studied, converting
nighttime hazy images to daytime-equivalent brightness remains largely
unaddressed. Existing methods face two critical limitations: (1) datasets
overlook the brightness relationship between day and night, resulting in the
brightness mapping being inconsistent with the real world during image
synthesis; and (2) models do not explicitly incorporate daytime brightness
knowledge, limiting their ability to reconstruct realistic lighting. To address
these challenges, we introduce the Diffusion-Based Nighttime Dehazing (DiffND)
framework, which excels in both data synthesis and lighting reconstruction. Our
approach starts with a data synthesis pipeline that simulates severe
distortions while enforcing brightness consistency between synthetic and
real-world scenes, providing a strong foundation for learning night-to-day
brightness mapping. Next, we propose a restoration model that integrates a
pre-trained diffusion model guided by a brightness perception network. This
design harnesses the diffusion model's generative ability while adapting it to
nighttime dehazing through brightness-aware optimization. Experiments validate
our dataset's utility and the model's superior performance in joint haze
removal and brightness mapping.

Motivation: 现有LiDAR语义分割模型在恶劣天气下精度下降，且少有研究关注点云的几何结构和反射强度异质域偏移问题。

Result: 实验表明，GRC在恶劣天气条件下优于现有方法，并取得新的最优结果。

Conclusion: GRC无需复杂模拟或增强，即可有效提取场景内在信息并抑制干扰，具有更好的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing LiDAR semantic segmentation models often suffer from decreased
accuracy when exposed to adverse weather conditions. Recent methods addressing
this issue focus on enhancing training data through weather simulation or
universal augmentation techniques. However, few works have studied the negative
impacts caused by the heterogeneous domain shifts in the geometric structure
and reflectance intensity of point clouds. In this paper, we delve into this
challenge and address it with a novel Geometry-Reflectance Collaboration (GRC)
framework that explicitly separates feature extraction for geometry and
reflectance. Specifically, GRC employs a dual-branch architecture designed to
independently process geometric and reflectance features initially, thereby
capitalizing on their distinct characteristic. Then, GRC adopts a robust
multi-level feature collaboration module to suppress redundant and unreliable
information from both branches. Consequently, without complex simulation or
augmentation, our method effectively extracts intrinsic information about the
scene while suppressing interference, thus achieving better robustness and
generalization in adverse weather conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of GRC through comprehensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, showing
that our method outperforms previous approaches and establishes new
state-of-the-art results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成技术的普及，图像可能被多次篡改，现有检测方法难以应对复杂的多阶段篡改，需系统性解决方案。

Method: 利用三种生成模型（StyleMapGAN、DiffSwap、FacePartsSwap）模拟多阶段篡改，构建数据集，并提出‘Modelship Attribution Transformer（MAT）’框架。

Result: 实验表明，MAT在多阶段篡改溯源中表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAT为复杂篡改场景提供了有效的溯源工具，填补了研究空白。

Abstract: As generative techniques become increasingly accessible, authentic visuals
are frequently subjected to iterative alterations by various individuals
employing a variety of tools. Currently, to avoid misinformation and ensure
accountability, a lot of research on detection and attribution is emerging.
Although these methods demonstrate promise in single-stage manipulation
scenarios, they fall short when addressing complex real-world iterative
manipulation. In this paper, we are the first, to the best of our knowledge, to
systematically model this real-world challenge and introduce a novel method to
solve it. We define a task called "Modelship Attribution", which aims to trace
the evolution of manipulated images by identifying the generative models
involved and reconstructing the sequence of edits they performed. To
realistically simulate this scenario, we utilize three generative models,
StyleMapGAN, DiffSwap, and FacePartsSwap, that sequentially modify distinct
regions of the same image. This process leads to the creation of the first
modelship dataset, comprising 83,700 images (16,740 images*5). Given that later
edits often overwrite the fingerprints of earlier models, the focus shifts from
extracting blended fingerprints to characterizing each model's distinctive
editing patterns. To tackle this challenge, we introduce the modelship
attribution transformer (MAT), a purpose-built framework designed to
effectively recognize and attribute the contributions of various models within
complex, multi-stage manipulation workflows. Through extensive experiments and
comparative analysis with other related methods, our results, including
comprehensive ablation studies, demonstrate that the proposed approach is a
highly effective solution for modelship attribution.

Abstract: Pre-trained encoders for offline feature extraction followed by multiple
instance learning (MIL) aggregators have become the dominant paradigm in
computational pathology (CPath), benefiting cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
However, performance limitations arise from the absence of encoder fine-tuning
for downstream tasks and disjoint optimization with MIL. While slide-level
supervised end-to-end (E2E) learning is an intuitive solution to this issue, it
faces challenges such as high computational demands and suboptimal results.
These limitations motivate us to revisit E2E learning. We argue that prior work
neglects inherent E2E optimization challenges, leading to performance
disparities compared to traditional two-stage methods. In this paper, we
pioneer the elucidation of optimization challenge caused by sparse-attention
MIL and propose a novel MIL called ABMILX. It mitigates this problem through
global correlation-based attention refinement and multi-head mechanisms. With
the efficient multi-scale random patch sampling strategy, an E2E trained ResNet
with ABMILX surpasses SOTA foundation models under the two-stage paradigm
across multiple challenging benchmarks, while remaining computationally
efficient (<10 RTX3090 hours). We show the potential of E2E learning in CPath
and calls for greater research focus in this area. The code is

Abstract: Diffusion models, while trained for image generation, have emerged as
powerful foundational feature extractors for downstream tasks. We find that
off-the-shelf diffusion models, trained exclusively to generate natural RGB
images, can identify semantically meaningful correspondences in medical images.
Building on this observation, we propose to leverage diffusion model features
as a similarity measure to guide deformable image registration networks. We
show that common intensity-based similarity losses often fail in challenging
scenarios, such as when certain anatomies are visible in one image but absent
in another, leading to anatomically inaccurate alignments. In contrast, our
method identifies true semantic correspondences, aligning meaningful structures
while disregarding those not present across images. We demonstrate superior
performance of our approach on two tasks: multimodal 2D registration (DXA to
X-Ray) and monomodal 3D registration (brain-extracted to non-brain-extracted
MRI). Code: https://github.com/uncbiag/dgir

Abstract: Multimodal functional neuroimaging enables systematic analysis of brain
mechanisms and provides discriminative representations for brain-computer
interface (BCI) decoding. However, its acquisition is constrained by high costs
and feasibility limitations. Moreover, underrepresentation of specific groups
undermines fairness of BCI decoding model. To address these challenges, we
propose a unified representation framework for multimodal functional
neuroimaging via generative artificial intelligence (AI). By mapping multimodal
functional neuroimaging into a unified representation space, the proposed
framework is capable of generating data for acquisition-constrained modalities
and underrepresented groups. Experiments show that the framework can generate
data consistent with real brain activity patterns, provide insights into brain
mechanisms, and improve performance on downstream tasks. More importantly, it
can enhance model fairness by augmenting data for underrepresented groups.
Overall, the framework offers a new paradigm for decreasing the cost of
acquiring multimodal functional neuroimages and enhancing the fairness of BCI
decoding models.

Abstract: Video-based Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification (VVI-ReID) aims to
match pedestrian sequences across modalities by extracting modality-invariant
sequence-level features. As a high-level semantic representation, language
provides a consistent description of pedestrian characteristics in both
infrared and visible modalities. Leveraging the Contrastive Language-Image
Pre-training (CLIP) model to generate video-level language prompts and guide
the learning of modality-invariant sequence-level features is theoretically
feasible. However, the challenge of generating and utilizing modality-shared
video-level language prompts to address modality gaps remains a critical
problem. To address this problem, we propose a simple yet powerful framework,
video-level language-driven VVI-ReID (VLD), which consists of two core modules:
invariant-modality language prompting (IMLP) and spatial-temporal prompting
(STP). IMLP employs a joint fine-tuning strategy for the visual encoder and the
prompt learner to effectively generate modality-shared text prompts and align
them with visual features from different modalities in CLIP's multimodal space,
thereby mitigating modality differences. Additionally, STP models
spatiotemporal information through two submodules, the spatial-temporal hub
(STH) and spatial-temporal aggregation (STA), which further enhance IMLP by
incorporating spatiotemporal information into text prompts. The STH aggregates
and diffuses spatiotemporal information into the [CLS] token of each frame
across the vision transformer (ViT) layers, whereas STA introduces dedicated
identity-level loss and specialized multihead attention to ensure that the STH
focuses on identity-relevant spatiotemporal feature aggregation. The VLD
framework achieves state-of-the-art results on two VVI-ReID benchmarks. The
code will be released at https://github.com/Visuang/VLD.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在生成高保真、动态合理的HOI序列上优于现有技术，泛化能力强。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了视频-运动一致性，适用于未见的真实场景。

Abstract: Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) generation has significant application
potential. However, current 3D HOI motion generation approaches heavily rely on
predefined 3D object models and lab-captured motion data, limiting
generalization capabilities. Meanwhile, HOI video generation methods prioritize
pixel-level visual fidelity, often sacrificing physical plausibility.
Recognizing that visual appearance and motion patterns share fundamental
physical laws in the real world, we propose a novel framework that combines
visual priors and dynamic constraints within a synchronized diffusion process
to generate the HOI video and motion simultaneously. To integrate the
heterogeneous semantics, appearance, and motion features, our method implements
tri-modal adaptive modulation for feature aligning, coupled with 3D
full-attention for modeling inter- and intra-modal dependencies. Furthermore,
we introduce a vision-aware 3D interaction diffusion model that generates
explicit 3D interaction sequences directly from the synchronized diffusion
outputs, then feeds them back to establish a closed-loop feedback cycle. This
architecture eliminates dependencies on predefined object models or explicit
pose guidance while significantly enhancing video-motion consistency.
Experimental results demonstrate our method's superiority over state-of-the-art
approaches in generating high-fidelity, dynamically plausible HOI sequences,
with notable generalization capabilities in unseen real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Despite the significant impact of visual events on human cognition,
understanding events in videos remains a challenging task for AI due to their
complex structures, semantic hierarchies, and dynamic evolution. To address
this, we propose the task of video event understanding that extracts event
scripts and makes predictions with these scripts from videos. To support this
task, we introduce VidEvent, a large-scale dataset containing over 23,000
well-labeled events, featuring detailed event structures, broad hierarchies,
and logical relations extracted from movie recap videos. The dataset was
created through a meticulous annotation process, ensuring high-quality and
reliable event data. We also provide comprehensive baseline models offering
detailed descriptions of their architecture and performance metrics. These
models serve as benchmarks for future research, facilitating comparisons and
improvements. Our analysis of VidEvent and the baseline models highlights the
dataset's potential to advance video event understanding and encourages the
exploration of innovative algorithms and models. The dataset and related
resources are publicly available at www.videvent.top.

TL;DR: ANT是一种自适应神经时间感知架构，通过动态调整语义粒度，显著提升文本到运动生成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在文本到运动生成中忽略了时间频率需求，导致早期去噪需要结构语义而后期需要局部细节，与生物形态发生类似。

Method: 提出ANT架构，包括语义时间自适应模块（STA）、动态无分类器引导调度（DCFG）和时间语义重加权。

Result: ANT显著提升模型性能，在StableMoFusion上实现最先进的语义对齐。

Conclusion: ANT通过动态调整语义粒度，有效解决了时间频率需求不匹配的问题，提升了文本到运动生成的性能。

Abstract: While diffusion models advance text-to-motion generation, their static
semantic conditioning ignores temporal-frequency demands: early denoising
requires structural semantics for motion foundations while later stages need
localized details for text alignment. This mismatch mirrors biological
morphogenesis where developmental phases demand distinct genetic programs.
Inspired by epigenetic regulation governing morphological specialization, we
propose **(ANT)**, an **A**daptive **N**eural **T**emporal-Aware architecture.
ANT orchestrates semantic granularity through: **(i) Semantic Temporally
Adaptive (STA) Module:** Automatically partitions denoising into low-frequency
structural planning and high-frequency refinement via spectral analysis. **(ii)
Dynamic Classifier-Free Guidance scheduling (DCFG):** Adaptively adjusts
conditional to unconditional ratio enhancing efficiency while maintaining
fidelity. **(iii) Temporal-semantic reweighting:** Quantitatively aligns text
influence with phase requirements. Extensive experiments show that ANT can be
applied to various baselines, significantly improving model performance, and
achieving state-of-the-art semantic alignment on StableMoFusion.

*Kunyu Wang,Xueyang Fu,Yunfei Bao,Chengjie Ge,Chengzhi Cao,Wei Zhai,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAID方法通过保留预训练权重的成对角度结构，提出了一种简单有效的CTTA方法，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTTA方法主要利用目标数据，而忽略了预训练权重中的领域不变先验信息。

Method: 分析预训练权重的几何属性（大小、绝对角度、成对角度结构），提出PAID方法，分解权重为大小和方向，并通过Householder反射学习正交矩阵以保留成对角度结构。

Result: 在四个CTTA基准测试中，PAID方法优于现有SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 保留成对角度结构是CTTA中简单有效的原则。

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to online adapt a pre-trained
model to changing environments during inference. Most existing methods focus on
exploiting target data, while overlooking another crucial source of
information, the pre-trained weights, which encode underutilized
domain-invariant priors. This paper takes the geometric attributes of
pre-trained weights as a starting point, systematically analyzing three key
components: magnitude, absolute angle, and pairwise angular structure. We find
that the pairwise angular structure remains stable across diverse corrupted
domains and encodes domain-invariant semantic information, suggesting it should
be preserved during adaptation. Based on this insight, we propose PAID
(Pairwise Angular-Invariant Decomposition), a prior-driven CTTA method that
decomposes weight into magnitude and direction, and introduces a learnable
orthogonal matrix via Householder reflections to globally rotate direction
while preserving the pairwise angular structure. During adaptation, only the
magnitudes and the orthogonal matrices are updated. PAID achieves consistent
improvements over recent SOTA methods on four widely used CTTA benchmarks,
demonstrating that preserving pairwise angular structure offers a simple yet
effective principle for CTTA.

TL;DR: ReSpace是一个基于自回归语言模型的生成框架，用于文本驱动的3D室内场景合成和编辑，支持显式房间边界和场景编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在对象语义、编辑支持或空间布局方面存在不足，ReSpace旨在通过自然语言和结构化表示解决这些问题。

Method: 采用双阶段训练方法（监督微调和偏好对齐），结合显式房间边界和零样本LLM进行场景编辑。

Result: 在对象添加任务上超越现有技术，同时在完整场景合成上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: ReSpace通过结构化表示和语言模型，为3D场景合成和编辑提供了更灵活和语义丰富的解决方案。

Abstract: Scene synthesis and editing has emerged as a promising direction in computer
graphics. Current trained approaches for 3D indoor scenes either oversimplify
object semantics through one-hot class encodings (e.g., 'chair' or 'table'),
require masked diffusion for editing, ignore room boundaries, or rely on floor
plan renderings that fail to capture complex layouts. In contrast, LLM-based
methods enable richer semantics via natural language (e.g., 'modern studio with
light wood furniture') but do not support editing, remain limited to
rectangular layouts or rely on weak spatial reasoning from implicit world
models. We introduce ReSpace, a generative framework for text-driven 3D indoor
scene synthesis and editing using autoregressive language models. Our approach
features a compact structured scene representation with explicit room
boundaries that frames scene editing as a next-token prediction task. We
leverage a dual-stage training approach combining supervised fine-tuning and
preference alignment, enabling a specially trained language model for object
addition that accounts for user instructions, spatial geometry, object
semantics, and scene-level composition. For scene editing, we employ a
zero-shot LLM to handle object removal and prompts for addition. We further
introduce a novel voxelization-based evaluation that captures fine-grained
geometry beyond 3D bounding boxes. Experimental results surpass
state-of-the-art on object addition while maintaining competitive results on
full scene synthesis.

Result: 在三个基准测试中，该方法在减少12%计算开销的同时，性能优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和性能之间取得了平衡，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptive object detection (CTTA-OD) aims to online adapt
a source pre-trained detector to ever-changing environments during inference
under continuous domain shifts. Most existing CTTA-OD methods prioritize
effectiveness while overlooking computational efficiency, which is crucial for
resource-constrained scenarios. In this paper, we propose an efficient CTTA-OD
method via pruning. Our motivation stems from the observation that not all
learned source features are beneficial; certain domain-sensitive feature
channels can adversely affect target domain performance. Inspired by this, we
introduce a sensitivity-guided channel pruning strategy that quantifies each
channel based on its sensitivity to domain discrepancies at both image and
instance levels. We apply weighted sparsity regularization to selectively
suppress and prune these sensitive channels, focusing adaptation efforts on
invariant ones. Additionally, we introduce a stochastic channel reactivation
mechanism to restore pruned channels, enabling recovery of potentially useful
features and mitigating the risks of early pruning. Extensive experiments on
three benchmarks show that our method achieves superior adaptation performance
while reducing computational overhead by 12% in FLOPs compared to the recent
SOTA method.

Abstract: Stroke rehabilitation often demands precise tracking of patient movements to

detection. In this work, we propose the High Resolution Temporal Transformer
(HRTR), to time-localize and classify high-resolution (fine-grained),
sub-second actions in a single-stage transformer, eliminating the need for
multi-stage methods and post-processing. Without any refinements, HRTR
outperforms state-of-the-art systems on both stroke related and general

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于条件去噪扩散模型的方法，通过短时视频中的物体运动生成形状和材质图，解决了单视角下的视觉歧义问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过轻微移动头部或旋转物体来消除单视角下形状和材质感知的歧义，受此启发，研究旨在通过运动观察提升视觉推理能力。

Method: 采用条件去噪扩散模型，直接在像素空间训练，生成多属性解耦的物体形状和材质图。

Result: 模型在静态观察下生成多模态预测，捕捉歧义；运动时快速收敛到更准确解释，并能处理真实世界物体。

Conclusion: 通过连续运动观察，该生成感知方法为物理系统中的视觉推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Perceiving the shape and material of an object from a single image is
inherently ambiguous, especially when lighting is unknown and unconstrained.
Despite this, humans can often disentangle shape and material, and when they
are uncertain, they often move their head slightly or rotate the object to help
resolve the ambiguities. Inspired by this behavior, we introduce a novel
conditional denoising-diffusion model that generates samples of
shape-and-material maps from a short video of an object undergoing differential
motions. Our parameter-efficient architecture allows training directly in
pixel-space, and it generates many disentangled attributes of an object
simultaneously. Trained on a modest number of synthetic object-motion videos
with supervision on shape and material, the model exhibits compelling emergent
behavior: For static observations, it produces diverse, multimodal predictions
of plausible shape-and-material maps that capture the inherent ambiguities; and
when objects move, the distributions quickly converge to more accurate
explanations. The model also produces high-quality shape-and-material estimates
for less ambiguous, real-world objects. By moving beyond single-view to
continuous motion observations, our work suggests a generative perception
approach for improving visual reasoning in physically-embodied systems.

Result: 在三个基准网络上测试，框架能持续积累知识并在新场景中超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 新框架有效提升去雨网络的适应性和泛化能力，适用于多样真实雨景。

Abstract: Current image de-raining methods primarily learn from a limited dataset,
leading to inadequate performance in varied real-world rainy conditions. To
tackle this, we introduce a new framework that enables networks to
progressively expand their de-raining knowledge base by tapping into a growing
pool of datasets, significantly boosting their adaptability. Drawing
inspiration from the human brain's ability to continuously absorb and
generalize from ongoing experiences, our approach borrow the mechanism of the
complementary learning system. Specifically, we first deploy Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) to capture and retain the unique features of new
data, mirroring the hippocampus's role in learning and memory. Then, the
de-raining network is trained with both existing and GAN-synthesized data,
mimicking the process of hippocampal replay and interleaved learning.
Furthermore, we employ knowledge distillation with the replayed data to
replicate the synergy between the neocortex's activity patterns triggered by
hippocampal replays and the pre-existing neocortical knowledge. This
comprehensive framework empowers the de-raining network to amass knowledge from
various datasets, continually enhancing its performance on previously unseen
rainy scenes. Our testing on three benchmark de-raining networks confirms the
framework's effectiveness. It not only facilitates continuous knowledge
accumulation across six datasets but also surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
generalizing to new real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: Flexiffusion是一种无需训练的NAS框架，通过动态生成计划和模型架构优化，显著加速扩散模型推理，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的高计算成本限制了其应用，现有NAS方法因重训练需求、搜索复杂性和慢速评估而效率低下。

Method: Flexiffusion将生成过程分解为灵活段，动态组合全计算、部分计算和跳过计算，并引入轻量级评估指标rFID。

Result: Flexiffusion在多个模型上实现2倍以上加速，FID下降小于5%，Stable Diffusion上达到5.1倍加速。

Conclusion: Flexiffusion为高效搜索高速扩散模型提供了新范式，无需牺牲生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) are powerful generative models capable of producing
high-fidelity images but are constrained by high computational costs due to
iterative multi-step inference. While Neural Architecture Search (NAS) can
optimize DMs, existing methods are hindered by retraining requirements,
exponential search complexity from step-wise optimization, and slow evaluation
relying on massive image generation. To address these challenges, we propose
Flexiffusion, a training-free NAS framework that jointly optimizes generation
schedules and model architectures without modifying pre-trained parameters. Our
key insight is to decompose the generation process into flexible segments of
equal length, where each segment dynamically combines three step types: full
(complete computation), partial (cache-reused computation), and null (skipped
computation). This segment-wise search space reduces the candidate pool
exponentially compared to step-wise NAS while preserving architectural
diversity. Further, we introduce relative FID (rFID), a lightweight evaluation
metric for NAS that measures divergence from a teacher model's outputs instead
of ground truth, slashing evaluation time by over $90\%$. In practice,
Flexiffusion achieves at least $2\times$ acceleration across LDMs, Stable
Diffusion, and DDPMs on ImageNet and MS-COCO, with FID degradation under $5\%$,
outperforming prior NAS and caching methods. Notably, it attains $5.1\times$
speedup on Stable Diffusion with near-identical CLIP scores. Our work pioneers
a resource-efficient paradigm for searching high-speed DMs without sacrificing
quality.

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，该方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 通过改进的不确定性测量和优化目标，提升了半监督医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Although existing semi-supervised image segmentation methods have achieved
good performance, they cannot effectively utilize multiple sources of
voxel-level uncertainty for targeted learning. Therefore, we propose two main
improvements. First, we introduce a novel pignistic co-evidential fusion
strategy using generalized evidential deep learning, extended by traditional
D-S evidence theory, to obtain a more precise uncertainty measure for each
voxel in medical samples. This assists the model in learning mixed labeled
information and establishing semantic associations between labeled and
unlabeled data. Second, we introduce the concept of information volume of mass
function (IVUM) to evaluate the constructed evidence, implementing two
evidential learning schemes. One optimizes evidential deep learning by
combining the information volume of the mass function with original uncertainty
measures. The other integrates the learning pattern based on the co-evidential
fusion strategy, using IVUM to design a new optimization objective. Experiments
on four datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our method.

Conclusion: ZeroPlane为跨领域3D平面重建提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D plane reconstruction from a single image is a crucial yet challenging
topic in 3D computer vision. Previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods have
focused on training their system on a single dataset from either indoor or
outdoor domain, limiting their generalizability across diverse testing data. In
this work, we introduce a novel framework dubbed ZeroPlane, a Transformer-based
model targeting zero-shot 3D plane detection and reconstruction from a single
image, over diverse domains and environments. To enable data-driven models
across multiple domains, we have curated a large-scale planar benchmark,
comprising over 14 datasets and 560,000 high-resolution, dense planar
annotations for diverse indoor and outdoor scenes. To address the challenge of
achieving desirable planar geometry on multi-dataset training, we propose to
disentangle the representation of plane normal and offset, and employ an
exemplar-guided, classification-then-regression paradigm to learn plane and
offset respectively. Additionally, we employ advanced backbones as image
encoder, and present an effective pixel-geometry-enhanced plane embedding
module to further facilitate planar reconstruction. Extensive experiments
across multiple zero-shot evaluation datasets have demonstrated that our
approach significantly outperforms previous methods on both reconstruction
accuracy and generalizability, especially over in-the-wild data. Our code and
data are available at: https://github.com/jcliu0428/ZeroPlane.

Result: 实现15倍插值，生成运动一致、外观连续的长视频。

Conclusion: LumosFlow显著提升了长视频生成的质量和效率。

Abstract: Long video generation has gained increasing attention due to its widespread
applications in fields such as entertainment and simulation. Despite advances,
synthesizing temporally coherent and visually compelling long sequences remains
a formidable challenge. Conventional approaches often synthesize long videos by
sequentially generating and concatenating short clips, or generating key frames
and then interpolate the intermediate frames in a hierarchical manner. However,
both of them still remain significant challenges, leading to issues such as
temporal repetition or unnatural transitions. In this paper, we revisit the
hierarchical long video generation pipeline and introduce LumosFlow, a
framework introduce motion guidance explicitly. Specifically, we first employ
the Large Motion Text-to-Video Diffusion Model (LMTV-DM) to generate key frames
with larger motion intervals, thereby ensuring content diversity in the
generated long videos. Given the complexity of interpolating contextual
transitions between key frames, we further decompose the intermediate frame
interpolation into motion generation and post-hoc refinement. For each pair of
key frames, the Latent Optical Flow Diffusion Model (LOF-DM) synthesizes
complex and large-motion optical flows, while MotionControlNet subsequently
refines the warped results to enhance quality and guide intermediate frame
generation. Compared with traditional video frame interpolation, we achieve 15x
interpolation, ensuring reasonable and continuous motion between adjacent
frames. Experiments show that our method can generate long videos with
consistent motion and appearance. Code and models will be made publicly
available upon acceptance. Our project page:

Conclusion: RelationAdapter为视觉提示驱动的图像编辑提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Inspired by the in-context learning mechanism of large language models
(LLMs), a new paradigm of generalizable visual prompt-based image editing is
emerging. Existing single-reference methods typically focus on style or
appearance adjustments and struggle with non-rigid transformations. To address
these limitations, we propose leveraging source-target image pairs to extract
and transfer content-aware editing intent to novel query images. To this end,
we introduce RelationAdapter, a lightweight module that enables Diffusion
Transformer (DiT) based models to effectively capture and apply visual
transformations from minimal examples. We also introduce Relation252K, a
comprehensive dataset comprising 218 diverse editing tasks, to evaluate model
generalization and adaptability in visual prompt-driven scenarios. Experiments
on Relation252K show that RelationAdapter significantly improves the model's
ability to understand and transfer editing intent, leading to notable gains in
generation quality and overall editing performance.

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用了不完美标签数据，显著提升了模型的泛化性能，为大规模应用提供了可能。

Abstract: Monocular height estimation is considered the most efficient and
cost-effective means of 3D perception in remote sensing, and it has attracted
much attention since the emergence of deep learning. While training neural
networks requires a large amount of data, data with perfect labels are scarce
and only available within developed regions. The trained models therefore lack
generalizability, which limits the potential for large-scale application of
existing methods. We tackle this problem for the first time, by introducing
data with imperfect labels into training pixel-wise height estimation networks,
including labels that are incomplete, inexact, and inaccurate compared to
high-quality labels. We propose an ensemble-based pipeline compatible with any
monocular height estimation network. Taking the challenges of noisy labels,
domain shift, and long-tailed distribution of height values into consideration,
we carefully design the architecture and loss functions to leverage the
information concealed in imperfect labels using weak supervision through
balanced soft losses and ordinal constraints. We conduct extensive experiments
on two datasets with different resolutions, DFC23 (0.5 to 1 m) and GBH (3 m).
The results indicate that the proposed pipeline outperforms baselines by
achieving more balanced performance across various domains, leading to
improvements of average root mean square errors up to 22.94 %, and 18.62 % on
DFC23 and GBH, respectively. The efficacy of each design component is validated
through ablation studies. Code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了视频异常检测的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods based on reconstruction or prediction
face two critical challenges: (1) strong generalization capability often
results in accurate reconstruction or prediction of abnormal events, making it
difficult to distinguish normal from abnormal patterns; (2) reliance only on
low-level appearance and motion cues limits their ability to identify
high-level semantic in abnormal events from complex scenes. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel VAD framework with two key innovations. First,
to suppress excessive generalization, we introduce the Sparse Feature Filtering
Module (SFFM) that employs bottleneck filters to dynamically and adaptively
remove abnormal information from features. Unlike traditional memory modules,
it does not need to memorize the normal prototypes across the training dataset.
Further, we design the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture for SFFM. Each
expert is responsible for extracting specialized principal features during
running time, and different experts are selectively activated to ensure the
diversity of the learned principal features. Second, to overcome the neglect of
semantics in existing methods, we integrate a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to
generate textual descriptions for video clips, enabling comprehensive joint
modeling of semantic, appearance, and motion cues. Additionally, we enforce
modality consistency through semantic similarity constraints and motion
frame-difference contrastive loss. Extensive experiments on multiple public
datasets validate the effectiveness of our multimodal joint modeling framework
and sparse feature filtering paradigm. Project page at

Abstract: Recent strides in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly
advanced their performance in many reasoning tasks. However, Abstract Visual
Reasoning (AVR) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to limitations in
perceiving abstract graphics. To tackle this issue, we investigate the
bottlenecks in current MLLMs and synthesize training data to improve their
abstract visual perception. First, we propose VisuRiddles, a benchmark for AVR,
featuring tasks meticulously constructed to assess models' reasoning capacities
across five core dimensions and two high-level reasoning categories. Second, we
introduce the Perceptual Riddle Synthesizer (PRS), an automated framework for
generating riddles with fine-grained perceptual descriptions. PRS not only
generates valuable training data for abstract graphics but also provides
fine-grained perceptual description, crucially allowing for supervision over
intermediate reasoning stages and thereby improving both training efficacy and
model interpretability. Our extensive experimental results on VisuRiddles
empirically validate that fine-grained visual perception is the principal
bottleneck and our synthesis framework markedly enhances the performance of
contemporary MLLMs on these challenging tasks. Our code and dataset will be
released at https://github.com/yh-hust/VisuRiddles

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POLED是一种概率框架，通过事件重要性概率密度函数（ePDF）动态估计事件重要性，支持场景自适应和零采样事件下采样，在多个任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机的高带宽和计算需求限制了其应用，现有下采样方法缺乏适应性。

Method: 提出POLED框架，利用ePDF在线估计事件重要性，并设计保留轮廓的ePDF。

Result: 在四个数据集和任务中验证了智能采样对性能的重要性。

Conclusion: POLED通过自适应事件下采样，显著提升了事件相机在资源受限场景下的实用性。

Abstract: Event cameras capture scene changes asynchronously on a per-pixel basis,
enabling extremely high temporal resolution. However, this advantage comes at
the cost of high bandwidth, memory, and computational demands. To address this,
prior work has explored event downsampling, but most approaches rely on fixed
heuristics or threshold-based strategies, limiting their adaptability. Instead,
we propose a probabilistic framework, POLED, that models event importance
through an event-importance probability density function (ePDF), which can be
arbitrarily defined and adapted to different applications. Our approach
operates in a purely online setting, estimating event importance on-the-fly
from raw event streams, enabling scene-specific adaptation. Additionally, we
introduce zero-shot event downsampling, where downsampled events must remain
usable for models trained on the original event stream, without task-specific
adaptation. We design a contour-preserving ePDF that prioritizes structurally
important events and evaluate our method across four datasets and tasks--object
classification, image interpolation, surface normal estimation, and object
detection--demonstrating that intelligent sampling is crucial for maintaining
performance under event-budget constraints.

Ego4D Long-Term Action Anticipation (LTA) task. Inspired by recent advances in
foundation models, our method consists of three stages: feature extraction,
action recognition, and long-term action anticipation. First, visual features
are extracted using a high-performance visual encoder. The features are then
fed into a Transformer to predict verbs and nouns, with a verb-noun
co-occurrence matrix incorporated to enhance recognition accuracy. Finally, the
predicted verb-noun pairs are formatted as textual prompts and input into a
fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to anticipate future action sequences.
Our framework achieves first place in this challenge at CVPR 2025, establishing
a new state-of-the-art in long-term action prediction. Our code will be

Motivation: 手术智能领域缺乏针对性的视觉语言模型，现有通用模型无法满足手术视觉感知、时间分析和推理的需求。

Method: 构建大规模多模态手术数据库SurgVLM-DB，统一并标准化23个公共数据集，基于Qwen2.5-VL开发SurgVLM模型，并进行指令调优。

Result: SurgVLM在SurgVLM-Bench上表现优异，与14种主流商业视觉语言模型相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: SurgVLM填补了手术智能领域基础模型的空白，为多样化手术任务提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved transformative success across biomedical
domains by enabling holistic understanding of multimodal data. However, their
application in surgery remains underexplored. Surgical intelligence presents
unique challenges - requiring surgical visual perception, temporal analysis,
and reasoning. Existing general-purpose vision-language models fail to address
these needs due to insufficient domain-specific supervision and the lack of a
large-scale high-quality surgical database. To bridge this gap, we propose
SurgVLM, one of the first large vision-language foundation models for surgical
intelligence, where this single universal model can tackle versatile surgical
tasks. To enable this, we construct a large-scale multimodal surgical database,
SurgVLM-DB, comprising over 1.81 million frames with 7.79 million
conversations, spanning more than 16 surgical types and 18 anatomical
structures. We unify and reorganize 23 public datasets across 10 surgical
tasks, followed by standardizing labels and doing hierarchical vision-language
alignment to facilitate comprehensive coverage of gradually finer-grained
surgical tasks, from visual perception, temporal analysis, to high-level
reasoning. Building upon this comprehensive dataset, we propose SurgVLM, which
is built upon Qwen2.5-VL, and undergoes instruction tuning to 10+ surgical
tasks. We further construct a surgical multimodal benchmark, SurgVLM-Bench, for
method evaluation. SurgVLM-Bench consists of 6 popular and widely-used datasets
in surgical domain, covering several crucial downstream tasks. Based on
SurgVLM-Bench, we evaluate the performance of our SurgVLM (3 SurgVLM variants:
SurgVLM-7B, SurgVLM-32B, and SurgVLM-72B), and conduct comprehensive
comparisons with 14 mainstream commercial VLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash,
Qwen2.5-Max).

*Shizhan Gong,Yankai Jiang,Qi Dou,Farzan Farnia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于核的方法，将CLIP的视觉表示与DINOv2对齐，提升感知能力并保持与文本嵌入的兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在细粒度感知方面存在不足，影响下游多模态大语言模型的性能，而DINOv2在细节捕捉方面表现优异。

Method: 采用基于核的方法对齐CLIP与DINOv2的视觉表示，设计高效的随机优化目标。

Result: 对齐后的视觉编码器在零样本物体识别、细粒度空间推理和定位任务中表现显著提升，下游MLLM性能也增强。

Conclusion: 通过视觉编码器的对齐优化，CLIP的感知能力得到增强，同时保持与文本嵌入的兼容性，提升了下游任务的表现。

Abstract: Vision-language models, such as CLIP, have achieved significant success in
aligning visual and textual representations, becoming essential components of
many multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) like LLaVA and OpenFlamingo.
However, numerous studies have identified CLIP's limited fine-grained
perception as a critical drawback, leading to substantial failures in
downstream MLLMs. In contrast, vision-centric foundation models like DINOv2
demonstrate remarkable capabilities in capturing fine details from images. In
this work, we propose a novel kernel-based method to align CLIP's visual
representation with that of DINOv2, ensuring that the resulting embeddings
maintain compatibility with text embeddings while enhancing perceptual
capabilities. Our alignment objective is designed for efficient stochastic
optimization. Following this image-only alignment fine-tuning, the visual
encoder retains compatibility with the frozen text encoder and exhibits
significant improvements in zero-shot object recognition, fine-grained spatial
reasoning, and localization. By integrating the aligned visual encoder,
downstream MLLMs also demonstrate enhanced performance.

### [171] [DCI: Dual-Conditional Inversion for Boosting Diffusion-Based Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02560)
*Zixiang Li,Haoyu Wang,Wei Wang,Chuangchuang Tan,Yunchao Wei,Yao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Dual-Conditional Inversion（DCI）的新框架，通过联合条件优化解决了扩散模型中重建精度与编辑灵活性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型的反演方法在重建精度和编辑灵活性之间存在固有折衷，难以同时保持语义对齐和结构一致性。

Method: DCI通过双条件固定点优化问题，联合源提示和参考图像指导反演过程，最小化潜在噪声差距和重建误差。

Result: 实验表明，DCI在多种编辑任务中达到最先进性能，显著提升重建质量和编辑精度，同时在重建任务中也表现优异。

Conclusion: DCI为反演过程提供了新的理解，其设计在语义和视觉空间中锚定反演轨迹，实现了更准确和可编辑的潜在表示。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation and
editing tasks. Inversion within these models aims to recover the latent noise
representation for a real or generated image, enabling reconstruction, editing,
and other downstream tasks. However, to date, most inversion approaches suffer
from an intrinsic trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and editing
flexibility. This limitation arises from the difficulty of maintaining both
semantic alignment and structural consistency during the inversion process. In
this work, we introduce Dual-Conditional Inversion (DCI), a novel framework
that jointly conditions on the source prompt and reference image to guide the
inversion process. Specifically, DCI formulates the inversion process as a
dual-condition fixed-point optimization problem, minimizing both the latent
noise gap and the reconstruction error under the joint guidance. This design
anchors the inversion trajectory in both semantic and visual space, leading to
more accurate and editable latent representations. Our novel setup brings new
understanding to the inversion process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
DCI achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple editing tasks,
significantly improving both reconstruction quality and editing precision.
Furthermore, we also demonstrate that our method achieves strong results in
reconstruction tasks, implying a degree of robustness and generalizability
approaching the ultimate goal of the inversion process.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer编码器和对比三元组损失的短轨迹嵌入学习框架，优于传统方法，并在Argoverse 2数据集上验证了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖计算密集型启发式或缺乏可解释性的潜在锚表示，无法高效且可控地检索语义和方向相似的短轨迹。

Method: 使用Transformer编码器和对比三元组损失学习固定维度的轨迹嵌入，分析Cosine和FFT相似度指标。

Result: Cosine相似度目标在语义和方向属性上表现更优，低维嵌入（如16维）在性能和计算开销间取得平衡。

Conclusion: 该框架为轨迹数据提供了紧凑、语义明确且高效的表示，为实时系统中的运动预测提供了透明且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: The ability to retrieve semantically and directionally similar short-range
trajectories with both accuracy and efficiency is foundational for downstream
applications such as motion forecasting and autonomous navigation. However,
prevailing approaches often depend on computationally intensive heuristics or
latent anchor representations that lack interpretability and controllability.
In this work, we propose a novel framework for learning fixed-dimensional
embeddings for short trajectories by leveraging a Transformer encoder trained
with a contrastive triplet loss that emphasize the importance of discriminative
feature spaces for trajectory data. We analyze the influence of Cosine and
FFT-based similarity metrics within the contrastive learning paradigm, with a
focus on capturing the nuanced directional intent that characterizes short-term
maneuvers. Our empirical evaluation on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrates
that embeddings shaped by Cosine similarity objectives yield superior
clustering of trajectories by both semantic and directional attributes,
outperforming FFT-based baselines in retrieval tasks. Notably, we show that
compact Transformer architectures, even with low-dimensional embeddings (e.g.,
16 dimensions, but qualitatively down to 4), achieve a compelling balance
between retrieval performance (minADE, minFDE) and computational overhead,
aligning with the growing demand for scalable and interpretable motion priors
in real-time systems. The resulting embeddings provide a compact, semantically
meaningful, and efficient representation of trajectory data, offering a robust
alternative to heuristic similarity measures and paving the way for more
transparent and controllable motion forecasting pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统校准方法需要大量受控环境数据且无法补偿运动中的变换变化，BEVCALIB旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过提取和融合相机与LiDAR的BEV特征到共享空间，并引入特征选择器优化训练效率。

Result: 在KITTI和NuScenes数据集上，BEVCALIB在平移和旋转误差上分别平均提升47.08%-82.32%和78.17%-68.29%。

Conclusion: BEVCALIB在LiDAR-相机校准领域实现了新的SOTA，代码已开源。

Abstract: Accurate LiDAR-camera calibration is fundamental to fusing multi-modal
perception in autonomous driving and robotic systems. Traditional calibration
methods require extensive data collection in controlled environments and cannot
compensate for the transformation changes during the vehicle/robot movement. In
this paper, we propose the first model that uses bird's-eye view (BEV) features
to perform LiDAR camera calibration from raw data, termed BEVCALIB. To achieve
this, we extract camera BEV features and LiDAR BEV features separately and fuse
them into a shared BEV feature space. To fully utilize the geometric
information from the BEV feature, we introduce a novel feature selector to
filter the most important features in the transformation decoder, which reduces
memory consumption and enables efficient training. Extensive evaluations on
KITTI, NuScenes, and our own dataset demonstrate that BEVCALIB establishes a
new state of the art. Under various noise conditions, BEVCALIB outperforms the
best baseline in the literature by an average of (47.08%, 82.32%) on KITTI
dataset, and (78.17%, 68.29%) on NuScenes dataset, in terms of (translation,
rotation), respectively. In the open-source domain, it improves the best
reproducible baseline by one order of magnitude. Our code and demo results are

Abstract: Recently, hyperspectral image generation has received increasing attention,
but existing generative models rely on conditional generation schemes, which
limits the diversity of generated images. Diffusion models are popular for
their ability to generate high-quality samples, but adapting these models from
RGB to hyperspectral data presents the challenge of high dimensionality and
physical constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel diffusion
model guided by hyperspectral unmixing. Our model comprises two key modules: an
unmixing autoencoder module and an abundance diffusion module. The unmixing
autoencoder module leverages unmixing guidance to shift the generative task
from the image space to the low-dimensional abundance space, significantly
reducing computational complexity while preserving high fidelity. The abundance
diffusion module generates samples that satisfy the constraints of
non-negativity and unity, ensuring the physical consistency of the
reconstructed HSIs. Additionally, we introduce two evaluation metrics tailored
to hyperspectral data. Empirical results, evaluated using both traditional
metrics and our proposed metrics, indicate that our model is capable of
generating high-quality and diverse hyperspectral images, offering an
advancement in hyperspectral data generation.

up-sampling for image super-resolution to analyze differences and relations of
different CNNs based interpolations and modules, and compare performance of
these methods by experiments. Finally, this paper gives potential research

Result: 实验表明，VPD-SR在一步采样下优于现有方法和教师模型。

Conclusion: VPD-SR在语义一致性和感知质量上表现优异，为高效一步超分辨率提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have been widely used in various visual generation
tasks, showing promising results in image super-resolution (SR), while
typically being limited by dozens or even hundreds of sampling steps. Although
existing methods aim to accelerate the inference speed of multi-step
diffusion-based SR methods through knowledge distillation, their generated
images exhibit insufficient semantic alignment with real images, resulting in
suboptimal perceptual quality reconstruction, specifically reflected in the
CLIPIQA score. These methods still have many challenges in perceptual quality
and semantic fidelity. Based on the challenges, we propose VPD-SR, a novel
visual perception diffusion distillation framework specifically designed for
SR, aiming to construct an effective and efficient one-step SR model.
Specifically, VPD-SR consists of two components: Explicit Semantic-aware
Supervision (ESS) and High-Frequency Perception (HFP) loss. Firstly, the ESS
leverages the powerful visual perceptual understanding capabilities of the CLIP
model to extract explicit semantic supervision, thereby enhancing semantic
consistency. Then, Considering that high-frequency information contributes to
the visual perception quality of images, in addition to the vanilla
distillation loss, the HFP loss guides the student model to restore the missing
high-frequency details in degraded images that are critical for enhancing
perceptual quality. Lastly, we expand VPD-SR in adversarial training manner to
further enhance the authenticity of the generated content. Extensive
experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the
proposed VPD-SR achieves superior performance compared to both previous
state-of-the-art methods and the teacher model with just one-step sampling.

Abstract: With the rapid development of space exploration, space debris has attracted
more attention due to its potential extreme threat, leading to the need for
real-time and accurate debris tracking. However, existing methods are mainly
based on traditional signal processing, which cannot effectively process the
complex background and dense space debris. In this paper, we propose a deep
learning-based Space Debris Tracking Network~(SDT-Net) to achieve highly
accurate debris tracking. SDT-Net effectively represents the feature of debris,
enhancing the efficiency and stability of end-to-end model learning. To train
and evaluate this model effectively, we also produce a large-scale dataset
Space Debris Tracking Dataset (SDTD) by a novel observation-based data
simulation scheme. SDTD contains 18,040 video sequences with a total of 62,562
frames and covers 250,000 synthetic space debris. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our model and the challenging of our dataset.
Furthermore, we test our model on real data from the Antarctic Station,
achieving a MOTA score of 70.6%, which demonstrates its strong transferability
to real-world scenarios. Our dataset and code will be released soon.

Result: 在自定义数据集上表现优于GPT-4o，显著降低推理时间，实时部署验证其低延迟能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高效推理的同时，能准确捕捉关键驾驶元素，适用于实时场景理解。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a hierarchical question-answering (QA) approach for
scene understanding in autonomous vehicles, balancing cost-efficiency with
detailed visual interpretation. The method fine-tunes a compact vision-language
model (VLM) on a custom dataset specific to the geographical area in which the
vehicle operates to capture key driving-related visual elements. At the
inference stage, the hierarchical QA strategy decomposes the scene
understanding task into high-level and detailed sub-questions. Instead of
generating lengthy descriptions, the VLM navigates a structured question tree,
where answering high-level questions (e.g., "Is it possible for the ego vehicle
to turn left at the intersection?") triggers more detailed sub-questions (e.g.,
"Is there a vehicle approaching the intersection from the opposite
direction?"). To optimize inference time, questions are dynamically skipped
based on previous answers, minimizing computational overhead. The extracted
answers are then synthesized using handcrafted templates to ensure coherent,
contextually accurate scene descriptions. We evaluate the proposed approach on
the custom dataset using GPT reference-free scoring, demonstrating its
competitiveness with state-of-the-art methods like GPT-4o in capturing key
scene details while achieving significantly lower inference time. Moreover,
qualitative results from real-time deployment highlight the proposed approach's
capacity to capture key driving elements with minimal latency.

the condition network achieves refined conditional control, thereby enhancing
the control and optimization of the image generation process. To evaluate the
robustness and generalization capability of our method across various image
degradation conditions, extensive experiments were conducted on several
benchmark datasets, including Rain100H, Rain100L, GoPro, and SSID. The results
demonstrate that our proposed approach consistently surpasses existing methods
in perceptual quality metrics, such as LPIPS and FID, while maintaining
comparable performance in image distortion metrics, including PSNR and SSIM,
highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability. Notably, ablation experiments
reveal that directly noise prediction in the diffusion process achieves better
performance, effectively balancing noise suppression and detail preservation.
Furthermore, the findings indicate that the Mamba architecture is particularly
well-suited as a conditional control network for diffusion models,
outperforming both CNN- and Attention-based approaches in this context.
Overall, these results highlight the flexibility and effectiveness of
ControlMambaIR in addressing a range of image restoration perceptual
challenges.

TL;DR: SAIL是一种基于适配器的高效测试时自适应框架，通过轻量级AdaptNet和梯度感知重置策略，显著降低计算成本并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法计算成本高且扩展性差，SAIL旨在解决这些问题。

Method: SAIL结合冻结预训练VLM和AdaptNet，通过置信度插值权重和批量处理实现高效自适应，并引入梯度漂移指示器（GDI）防止灾难性遗忘。

Result: SAIL在多样基准测试中表现优异，计算成本低，适用于实际部署。

Conclusion: SAIL高效、可扩展且性能优越，为测试时自适应提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing
the generalization capability of vision-language models (VLMs) during
inference. However, existing approaches often incur substantial computational
costs and exhibit poor scalability, primarily due to sample-wise adaptation
granularity and reliance on costly auxiliary designs such as data augmentation.
To address these limitations, we introduce SAIL (Small Aid, Big Leap), a novel
adapter-based TTA framework that leverages a lightweight, learnable AdaptNet to
enable efficient and scalable model adaptation. As SAIL's core, a frozen
pre-trained VLM collaborates with AdaptNet through a confidence-based
interpolation weight, generating robust predictions during inference. These
predictions serve as self-supervised targets to align AdaptNet's outputs
through efficient batch-wise processing, dramatically reducing computational
costs without modifying the VLM or requiring memory caches. To mitigate
catastrophic forgetting during continual adaptation, we propose a
gradient-aware reset strategy driven by a gradient drift indicator (GDI), which
dynamically detects domain transitions and strategically resets AdaptNet for
stable adaptation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks on two
scenarios demonstrate that SAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining low computational costs. These results highlight SAIL's
effectiveness, efficiency and scalability for real-world deployment. The code
will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: 当前CD-FSS方法在特征比较中存在特征纠缠问题，限制了知识的跨域迁移能力。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在1-shot和5-shot设置下分别比现有方法平均准确率提高了1.92%和1.88%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了特征纠缠问题，提升了跨域少样本分割的性能。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) aims to transfer knowledge from a
source-domain dataset to unseen target-domain datasets with limited
annotations. Current methods typically compare the distance between training
and testing samples for mask prediction. However, we find an entanglement
problem exists in this widely adopted method, which tends to bind sourcedomain
patterns together and make each of them hard to transfer. In this paper, we aim
to address this problem for the CD-FSS task. We first find a natural
decomposition of the ViT structure, based on which we delve into the
entanglement problem for an interpretation. We find the decomposed ViT
components are crossly compared between images in distance calculation, where
the rational comparisons are entangled with those meaningless ones by their
equal importance, leading to the entanglement problem. Based on this
interpretation, we further propose to address the entanglement problem by
learning to weigh for all comparisons of ViT components, which learn
disentangled features and re-compose them for the CD-FSS task, benefiting both
the generalization and finetuning. Experiments show that our model outperforms
the state-of-the-art CD-FSS method by 1.92% and 1.88% in average accuracy under
1-shot and 5-shot settings, respectively.

Conclusion: FLAIR为逆问题提供了一种高效且无需训练的解决方案，显著提升了基于流生成模型的实用性。

Abstract: Flow-based latent generative models such as Stable Diffusion 3 are able to
generate images with remarkable quality, even enabling photorealistic
text-to-image generation. Their impressive performance suggests that these
models should also constitute powerful priors for inverse imaging problems, but
that approach has not yet led to comparable fidelity. There are several key
obstacles: (i) the encoding into a lower-dimensional latent space makes the
underlying (forward) mapping non-linear; (ii) the data likelihood term is
usually intractable; and (iii) learned generative models struggle to recover
rare, atypical data modes during inference. We present FLAIR, a novel training
free variational framework that leverages flow-based generative models as a
prior for inverse problems. To that end, we introduce a variational objective
for flow matching that is agnostic to the type of degradation, and combine it
with deterministic trajectory adjustments to recover atypical modes. To enforce
exact consistency with the observed data, we decouple the optimization of the
data fidelity and regularization terms. Moreover, we introduce a time-dependent
calibration scheme in which the strength of the regularization is modulated
according to off-line accuracy estimates. Results on standard imaging
benchmarks demonstrate that FLAIR consistently outperforms existing diffusion-
and flow-based methods in terms of reconstruction quality and sample diversity.

Abstract: Geometry problem solving (GPS) represents a critical frontier in artificial

challenging due to the dual demands of spatial understanding and rigorous
logical reasoning. Recent advances in large models have enabled notable

fragmented across methodologies, benchmarks, and evaluation frameworks. This
survey systematically synthesizes GPS advancements through three core
dimensions: (1) benchmark construction, (2) textual and diagrammatic parsing,
and (3) reasoning paradigms. We further propose a unified analytical paradigm,
assess current limitations, and identify emerging opportunities to guide future
research toward human-level geometric reasoning, including automated benchmark
generation and interpretable neuro-symbolic integration.

Result: SurgVISTA在13个视频级数据集上的实验表现优于自然和手术领域的预训练模型。

Conclusion: SurgVISTA展示了在临床场景中推动智能手术系统的潜力。

Abstract: Computer-Assisted Intervention (CAI) has the potential to revolutionize
modern surgery, with surgical scene understanding serving as a critical
component in supporting decision-making, improving procedural efficacy, and
ensuring intraoperative safety. While existing AI-driven approaches alleviate
annotation burdens via self-supervised spatial representation learning, their
lack of explicit temporal modeling during pre-training fundamentally restricts
the capture of dynamic surgical contexts, resulting in incomplete
spatiotemporal understanding. In this work, we introduce the first video-level
surgical pre-training framework that enables joint spatiotemporal
representation learning from large-scale surgical video data. To achieve this,
we constructed a large-scale surgical video dataset comprising 3,650 videos and
approximately 3.55 million frames, spanning more than 20 surgical procedures
and over 10 anatomical structures. Building upon this dataset, we propose
SurgVISTA (Surgical Video-level Spatial-Temporal Architecture), a
reconstruction-based pre-training method that captures intricate spatial
structures and temporal dynamics through joint spatiotemporal modeling.
Additionally, SurgVISTA incorporates image-level knowledge distillation guided
by a surgery-specific expert to enhance the learning of fine-grained anatomical
and semantic features. To validate its effectiveness, we established a
comprehensive benchmark comprising 13 video-level datasets spanning six
surgical procedures across four tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SurgVISTA consistently outperforms both natural- and surgical-domain
pre-trained models, demonstrating strong potential to advance intelligent
surgical systems in clinically meaningful scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FaceSleuth是一种双流架构，通过垂直注意力模块和动态学习方向的注意力模块，显著提升了微表情识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别需要放大毫秒级、低幅度的面部运动，同时抑制身份特征。

Method: 采用双流架构，包括垂直注意力模块（CVA）、面部位置聚焦器和动作单元嵌入，并引入动态学习方向的SOA模块。

Result: 在三个标准数据集上，FaceSleuth性能超越现有方法，最高达95.1%准确率。

Conclusion: 垂直注意力偏置是微表情识别中最具判别性的方向，FaceSleuth为此提供了实证支持。

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) demands models that can amplify
millisecond-level, low-amplitude facial motions while suppressing
identity-specific appearance. We introduce FaceSleuth, a dual-stream
architecture that (1) enhances motion along the empirically dominant vertical
axix through a Continuously Vertical Attention (CVA) block, (2) localises the
resulting signals with a Facial Position Focalizer built on hierarchical
cross-window attention, and (3) steers feature learning toward physiologically
meaningful regions via lightweight Action-Unit embeddings. To examine whether
the hand-chosen vertical axis is indeed optimal, we further propose a
Single-Orientation Attention (SOA) module that learns its own pooling direction
end-to-end. SOA is differentiable, adds only 0.16 % parameters, and collapses
to CVA when the learned angle converges to {\Pi}/2. In practice, SOA reliably
drifts to 88{\deg}, confirming the effectiveness of the vertical prior while
delivering consistent gains. On three standard MER benchmarks, FaceSleuth with
CVA already surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods; plugging in SOA lifts
accuracy and F1 score performance to 95.1 % / 0.918 on CASME II, 87.1 % / 0.840
on SAMM, and 92.9 % / 0.917 on MMEW without sacrificing model compactness.
These results establish a new state of the art and, for the first time, provide
empirical evidence that the vertical attention bias is the most discriminative
orientation for MER.

Conclusion: 该方法通过检索和参考引导，有效提升了可控布局生成的性能，为设计任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Controllable layout generation aims to create plausible visual arrangements
of element bounding boxes within a graphic design according to certain optional
constraints, such as the type or position of a specific component. While recent
diffusion or flow-matching models have achieved considerable advances in
multifarious conditional generation tasks, there remains considerable room for
generating optimal arrangements under given conditions. In this work, we
propose to carry out layout generation through retrieving by conditions and
reference-guided generation. Specifically, we retrieve appropriate layout
templates according to given conditions as references. The references are then
utilized to guide the denoising or flow-based transport process. By retrieving
layouts compatible with the given conditions, we can uncover the potential
information not explicitly provided in the given condition. Such an approach
offers more effective guidance to the model during the generation process, in
contrast to previous models that feed the condition to the model and let the
model infer the unprovided layout attributes directly. Meanwhile, we design a
condition-modulated attention that selectively absorbs retrieval knowledge,
adapting to the difference between retrieved templates and given conditions.
Extensive experiment results show that our method successfully produces
high-quality layouts that meet the given conditions and outperforms existing
state-of-the-art models. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Result: SmPO-Diffusion在偏好评估中表现最优，训练成本更低，性能超越基线方法。

Conclusion: SmPO-Diffusion通过简单修改有效解决了现有方法的不足，实现了更精准的偏好对齐和优化。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) aligns text-to-image (T2I) generation
models with human preferences using pairwise preference data. Although
substantial resources are expended in collecting and labeling datasets, a
critical aspect is often neglected: \textit{preferences vary across individuals
and should be represented with more granularity.} To address this, we propose
SmPO-Diffusion, a novel method for modeling preference distributions to improve
the DPO objective, along with a numerical upper bound estimation for the
diffusion optimization objective. First, we introduce a smoothed preference
distribution to replace the original binary distribution. We employ a reward
model to simulate human preferences and apply preference likelihood averaging
to improve the DPO loss, such that the loss function approaches zero when
preferences are similar. Furthermore, we utilize an inversion technique to
simulate the trajectory preference distribution of the diffusion model,
enabling more accurate alignment with the optimization objective. Our approach
effectively mitigates issues of excessive optimization and objective
misalignment present in existing methods through straightforward modifications.
Our SmPO-Diffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in preference
evaluation, outperforming baselines across metrics with lower training costs.

Conclusion: ToothForge在频谱分析和机器学习的交叉领域提供了更灵活的方法，适用于牙科及其他医学形状分析。

Abstract: We introduce ToothForge, a spectral approach for automatically generating
novel 3D teeth, effectively addressing the sparsity of dental shape datasets.
By operating in the spectral domain, our method enables compact machine
learning modeling, allowing the generation of high-resolution tooth meshes in
milliseconds. However, generating shape spectra comes with the instability of
the decomposed harmonics. To address this, we propose modeling the latent
manifold on synchronized frequential embeddings. Spectra of all data samples
are aligned to a common basis prior to the training procedure, effectively
eliminating biases introduced by the decomposition instability. Furthermore,
synchronized modeling removes the limiting factor imposed by previous methods,
which require all shapes to share a common fixed connectivity. Using a private
dataset of real dental crowns, we observe a greater reconstruction quality of
the synthetized shapes, exceeding those of models trained on unaligned
embeddings. We also explore additional applications of spectral analysis in
digital dentistry, such as shape compression and interpolation. ToothForge
facilitates a range of approaches at the intersection of spectral analysis and
machine learning, with fewer restrictions on mesh structure. This makes it
applicable for shape analysis not only in dentistry, but also in broader
medical applications, where guaranteeing consistent connectivity across shapes
from various clinics is unrealistic. The code is available at

method for creating a dataset designed to improve alignment between predicted
scores and their textual justifications. By iteratively training the model with
Direct Preference Optimization on two distinct datasets and merging them, we
can improve both scoring accuracy and the coherence of generated explanations.

Abstract: Existing semantic SLAM in dynamic environments mainly identify dynamic
regions through object detection or semantic segmentation methods. However, in
certain highly dynamic scenarios, the detection boxes or segmentation masks
cannot fully cover dynamic regions. Therefore, this paper proposes a robust and
efficient GeneA-SLAM2 system that leverages depth variance constraints to
handle dynamic scenes. Our method extracts dynamic pixels via depth variance
and creates precise depth masks to guide the removal of dynamic objects.
Simultaneously, an autoencoder is used to reconstruct keypoints, improving the
genetic resampling keypoint algorithm to obtain more uniformly distributed
keypoints and enhance the accuracy of pose estimation. Our system was evaluated
on multiple highly dynamic sequences. The results demonstrate that GeneA-SLAM2
maintains high accuracy in dynamic scenes compared to current methods. Code is

Abstract: Jointly estimating camera poses and mapping scenes from RGBD images is a
fundamental task in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM).
State-of-the-art methods employ 3D Gaussians to represent a scene, and render
these Gaussians through splatting for higher efficiency and better rendering.
However, these methods cannot scale up to extremely large scenes, due to the
inefficient tracking and mapping strategies that need to optimize all 3D
Gaussians in the limited GPU memories throughout the training to maintain the
geometry and color consistency to previous RGBD observations. To resolve this
issue, we propose novel tracking and mapping strategies to work with a novel 3D
representation, dubbed view-tied 3D Gaussians, for RGBD SLAM systems. View-tied
3D Gaussians is a kind of simplified Gaussians, which is tied to depth pixels,
without needing to learn locations, rotations, and multi-dimensional variances.
Tying Gaussians to views not only significantly saves storage but also allows
us to employ many more Gaussians to represent local details in the limited GPU
memory. Moreover, our strategies remove the need of maintaining all Gaussians
learnable throughout the training, while improving rendering quality, and
tracking accuracy. We justify the effectiveness of these designs, and report
better performance over the latest methods on the widely used benchmarks in
terms of rendering and tracking accuracy and scalability. Please see our

TL;DR: RobustSplat通过延迟高斯增长和尺度级联掩码引导，解决了3D高斯溅射中瞬态物体导致的渲染伪影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在建模受瞬态物体影响的场景时，因高斯密度化过程导致伪影，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 提出延迟高斯增长策略和尺度级联掩码引导方法，优化静态场景结构并精确预测瞬态掩码。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，验证了鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: RobustSplat显著提升了3D高斯溅射在复杂场景中的渲染质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for its
real-time, photo-realistic rendering in novel-view synthesis and 3D modeling.
However, existing methods struggle with accurately modeling scenes affected by
transient objects, leading to artifacts in the rendered images. We identify
that the Gaussian densification process, while enhancing scene detail capture,
unintentionally contributes to these artifacts by growing additional Gaussians
that model transient disturbances. To address this, we propose RobustSplat, a
robust solution based on two critical designs. First, we introduce a delayed
Gaussian growth strategy that prioritizes optimizing static scene structure
before allowing Gaussian splitting/cloning, mitigating overfitting to transient
objects in early optimization. Second, we design a scale-cascaded mask
bootstrapping approach that first leverages lower-resolution feature similarity
supervision for reliable initial transient mask estimation, taking advantage of
its stronger semantic consistency and robustness to noise, and then progresses
to high-resolution supervision to achieve more precise mask prediction.
Extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets show that our method
outperforms existing methods, clearly demonstrating the robustness and
effectiveness of our method. Our project page is

Result: 模型在任务驱动视觉搜索中性能仅下降3.86%，计算成本降低92.29%（GFLOPs）和31.23%（参数）。

Conclusion: 自由观看和任务驱动视觉搜索可以高效共享共同表示，显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: Computational human attention modeling in free-viewing and task-specific
settings is often studied separately, with limited exploration of whether a
common representation exists between them. This work investigates this question
and proposes a neural network architecture that builds upon the Human Attention
transformer (HAT) to test the hypothesis. Our results demonstrate that
free-viewing and visual search can efficiently share a common representation,
allowing a model trained in free-viewing attention to transfer its knowledge to
task-driven visual search with a performance drop of only 3.86% in the
predicted fixation scanpaths, measured by the semantic sequence score (SemSS)
metric which reflects the similarity between predicted and human scanpaths.
This transfer reduces computational costs by 92.29% in terms of GFLOPs and
31.23% in terms of trainable parameters.

Conclusion: DTNet通过动态和注意力机制显著提升了车辆检测的适应性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Stable consumer electronic systems can assist traffic better. Good traffic
consumer electronic systems require collaborative work between traffic
algorithms and hardware. However, performance of popular traffic algorithms
containing vehicle detection methods based on deep networks via learning data
relation rather than learning differences in different lighting and occlusions
is limited. In this paper, we present a dynamic Transformer network for vehicle
detection (DTNet). DTNet utilizes a dynamic convolution to guide a deep network
to dynamically generate weights to enhance adaptability of an obtained
detector. Taking into relations of different information account, a mixed
attention mechanism based channel attention and Transformer is exploited to
strengthen relations of channels and pixels to extract more salient information
for vehicle detection. To overcome the drawback of difference in an image
account, a translation-variant convolution relies on spatial location
information to refine obtained structural information for vehicle detection.
Experimental results illustrate that our DTNet is competitive for vehicle
detection. Code of the proposed DTNet can be obtained at

Abstract: Controllability plays a crucial role in the practical applications of 3D
indoor scene synthesis. Existing works either allow rough language-based
control, that is convenient but lacks fine-grained scene customization, or
employ graph based control, which offers better controllability but demands
considerable knowledge for the cumbersome graph design process. To address
these challenges, we present FreeScene, a user-friendly framework that enables
both convenient and effective control for indoor scene synthesis.Specifically,
FreeScene supports free-form user inputs including text description and/or
reference images, allowing users to express versatile design intentions. The
user inputs are adequately analyzed and integrated into a graph representation
by a VLM-based Graph Designer. We then propose MG-DiT, a Mixed Graph Diffusion
Transformer, which performs graph-aware denoising to enhance scene generation.
Our MG-DiT not only excels at preserving graph structure but also offers broad
applicability to various tasks, including, but not limited to, text-to-scene,
graph-to-scene, and rearrangement, all within a single model. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that FreeScene provides an efficient and user-friendly
solution that unifies text-based and graph based scene synthesis, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in terms of both generation quality and
controllability in a range of applications.

Motivation: ONSD与颅内压（ICP）线性相关，但手动测量依赖操作者经验，需自动化以提高准确性。

Method: 使用KCF跟踪算法和SLIC分割算法自动选择最佳帧，结合GMM和KL散度方法测量ONSD。

Result: 与专家测量相比，平均误差0.04，均方偏差0.054，ICC为0.782，准确性高。

Conclusion: 该方法自动化程度高，准确性好，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Objective. Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is recognized as a biomarker
of secondary brain injury, with a significant linear correlation observed
between optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) and ICP. Frequent monitoring of ONSD
could effectively support dynamic evaluation of ICP. However, ONSD measurement
is heavily reliant on the operator's experience and skill, particularly in
manually selecting the optimal frame from ultrasound sequences and measuring
ONSD. Approach. This paper presents a novel method to automatically identify
the optimal frame from video sequences for ONSD measurement by employing the
Kernel Correlation Filter (KCF) tracking algorithm and Simple Linear Iterative
Clustering (SLIC) segmentation algorithm. The optic nerve sheath is mapped and
measured using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) combined with a
KL-divergence-based method. Results. When compared with the average
measurements of two expert clinicians, the proposed method achieved a mean
error, mean squared deviation, and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of
0.04, 0.054, and 0.782, respectively. Significance. The findings suggest that
this method provides highly accurate automated ONSD measurements, showing
potential for clinical application.

Conclusion: 随机寄存器是一种有效的注意力扰动方法，能显著提升ViT在跨域少样本学习中的性能。

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) aims to transfer knowledge from a
data-sufficient source domain to data-scarce target domains. Although Vision
Transformer (ViT) has shown superior capability in many vision tasks, its
transferability against huge domain gaps in CDFSL is still under-explored. In
this paper, we find an intriguing phenomenon: during the source-domain
training, prompt tuning, as a common way to train ViT, could be harmful for the
generalization of ViT in target domains, but setting them to random noises
(i.e., random registers) could consistently improve target-domain performance.
We then delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation. We find that
learnable prompts capture domain information during the training on the source
dataset, which views irrelevant visual patterns as vital cues for recognition.
This can be viewed as a kind of overfitting and increases the sharpness of the
loss landscapes. In contrast, random registers are essentially a novel way of
perturbing attention for the sharpness-aware minimization, which helps the
model find a flattened minimum in loss landscapes, increasing the
transferability. Based on this phenomenon and interpretation, we further
propose a simple but effective approach for CDFSL to enhance the perturbation
on attention maps by adding random registers on the semantic regions of image
tokens, improving the effectiveness and efficiency of random registers.
Extensive experiments on four benchmarks validate our rationale and
state-of-the-art performance. Codes and models are available at

Conclusion: PBR-SR是一种高效、高质量的PBR纹理超分辨率方法，适用于高级应用如重新光照。

Abstract: We present PBR-SR, a novel method for physically based rendering (PBR)
texture super resolution (SR). It outputs high-resolution, high-quality PBR
textures from low-resolution (LR) PBR input in a zero-shot manner. PBR-SR
leverages an off-the-shelf super-resolution model trained on natural images,
and iteratively minimizes the deviations between super-resolution priors and
differentiable renderings. These enhancements are then back-projected into the
PBR map space in a differentiable manner to produce refined, high-resolution
textures. To mitigate view inconsistencies and lighting sensitivity, which is
common in view-based super-resolution, our method applies 2D prior constraints
across multi-view renderings, iteratively refining the shared, upscaled
textures. In parallel, we incorporate identity constraints directly in the PBR
texture domain to ensure the upscaled textures remain faithful to the LR input.
PBR-SR operates without any additional training or data requirements, relying
entirely on pretrained image priors. We demonstrate that our approach produces
high-fidelity PBR textures for both artist-designed and AI-generated meshes,
outperforming both direct SR models application and prior texture optimization
methods. Our results show high-quality outputs in both PBR and rendering
evaluations, supporting advanced applications such as relighting.

Motivation: 处理长视频时计算需求高且视觉数据冗余，现有方法效率不足。

Method: METok通过三个阶段逐步消除冗余视觉令牌：事件感知压缩、分层令牌修剪和解码阶段KV缓存优化。

Result: 实验表明，METok在效率和准确性之间取得平衡，显著减少计算和内存消耗。

Conclusion: METok为视频大语言模型提供了一种高效且准确的推理解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) have significantly
enhanced their ability to understand video content. Nonetheless, processing
long videos remains challenging due to high computational demands and the
redundancy present in the visual data. In this work, we propose METok, a
training-free, Multi-stage Event-based Token compression framework designed to
accelerate VLLMs' inference while preserving accuracy. METok progressively
eliminates redundant visual tokens across three critical stages: (1)
event-aware compression during vision encoding, (2) hierarchical token pruning
in the prefilling stage based on semantic alignment and event importance, and
(3) a decoding-stage KV Cache optimization that further reduces memory
consumption. Our experiments on diverse video benchmarks demonstrate that METok
achieves an optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy by dynamically
selecting informative visual tokens. For instance, equipping LongVA-7B with
METok realizes an 80.6% FLOPs reduction and 93.5% KV Cache memory savings, all
while maintaining comparable or even superior accuracy.

Abstract: Action coordination in human structure is indispensable for the spatial
constraints of 2D joints to recover 3D pose. Usually, action coordination is
represented as a long-range dependence among body parts. However, there are two
main challenges in modeling long-range dependencies. First, joints should not
only be constrained by other individual joints but also be modulated by the
body parts. Second, existing methods make networks deeper to learn dependencies
between non-linked parts. They introduce uncorrelated noise and increase the
model size. In this paper, we utilize a pyramid structure to better learn
potential long-range dependencies. It can capture the correlation across joints
and groups, which complements the context of the human sub-structure. In an
effective cross-scale way, it captures the pyramid-structured long-range
dependence. Specifically, we propose a novel Pyramid Graph Attention (PGA)
module to capture long-range cross-scale dependencies. It concatenates
information from various scales into a compact sequence, and then computes the
correlation between scales in parallel. Combining PGA with graph convolution
modules, we develop a Pyramid Graph Transformer (PGFormer) for 3D human pose
estimation, which is a lightweight multi-scale transformer architecture. It
encapsulates human sub-structures into self-attention by pooling. Extensive
experiments show that our approach achieves lower error and smaller model size
than state-of-the-art methods on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets. The code
is available at https://github.com/MingjieWe/PGFormer.

Conclusion: 抽象提示比位置提示更具语义信息，显著提升模型的鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Abstract: Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is highly effective in natural
image segmentation, it requires dependencies on prompts, which limits its
applicability to medical imaging where manual prompts are often unavailable.
Existing efforts to fine-tune SAM for medical segmentation typically struggle
to remove this dependency. We propose Hierarchical Self-Prompting SAM
(HSP-SAM), a novel self-prompting framework that enables SAM to achieve strong
performance in prompt-free medical image segmentation. Unlike previous
self-prompting methods that remain limited to positional prompts similar to
vanilla SAM, we are the first to introduce learning abstract prompts during the
self-prompting process. This simple and intuitive self-prompting framework
achieves superior performance on classic segmentation tasks such as polyp and
skin lesion segmentation, while maintaining robustness across diverse medical
imaging modalities. Furthermore, it exhibits strong generalization to unseen
datasets, achieving improvements of up to 14.04% over previous state-of-the-art
methods on some challenging benchmarks. These results suggest that abstract
prompts encapsulate richer and higher-dimensional semantic information compared
to positional prompts, thereby enhancing the model's robustness and
generalization performance. All models and codes will be released upon
acceptance.

Abstract: Detecting deepfakes has become a critical challenge in Computer Vision and
Artificial Intelligence. Despite significant progress in detection techniques,
generalizing them to open-set scenarios continues to be a persistent
difficulty. Neural networks are often trained on the closed-world assumption,
but with new generative models constantly evolving, it is inevitable to
encounter data generated by models that are not part of the training
distribution. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose two novel
Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection approaches. The first approach is trained
to reconstruct the input image, while the second incorporates an attention
mechanism for detecting OODs. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of the
proposed approaches compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. Our
method achieves promising results in deepfake detection and ranks among the
top-performing configurations on the benchmark, demonstrating their potential
for robust, adaptable solutions in dynamic, real-world applications.

Conclusion: MVTD为海事VOT提供了真实且具有挑战性的基准，推动了领域专用跟踪技术的发展。

Abstract: Visual Object Tracking (VOT) is a fundamental task with widespread
applications in autonomous navigation, surveillance, and maritime robotics.
Despite significant advances in generic object tracking, maritime environments
continue to present unique challenges, including specular water reflections,
low-contrast targets, dynamically changing backgrounds, and frequent
occlusions. These complexities significantly degrade the performance of
state-of-the-art tracking algorithms, highlighting the need for domain-specific
datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the Maritime Visual Tracking
Dataset (MVTD), a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark specifically
designed for maritime VOT. MVTD comprises 182 high-resolution video sequences,
totaling approximately 150,000 frames, and includes four representative object
classes: boat, ship, sailboat, and unmanned surface vehicle (USV). The dataset
captures a diverse range of operational conditions and maritime scenarios,
reflecting the real-world complexities of maritime environments. We evaluated
14 recent SOTA tracking algorithms on the MVTD benchmark and observed
substantial performance degradation compared to their performance on
general-purpose datasets. However, when fine-tuned on MVTD, these models
demonstrate significant performance gains, underscoring the effectiveness of
domain adaptation and the importance of transfer learning in specialized
tracking contexts. The MVTD dataset fills a critical gap in the visual tracking
community by providing a realistic and challenging benchmark for maritime
scenarios. Dataset and Source Code can be accessed here

Abstract: Accurate mapping of permafrost landforms, thaw disturbances, and human-built
infrastructure at pan-Arctic scale using sub-meter satellite imagery is
increasingly critical. Handling petabyte-scale image data requires
high-performance computing and robust feature detection models. While
convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep learning approaches are widely
used for remote sensing (RS),similar to the success in transformer based large
language models, Vision Transformers (ViTs) offer advantages in capturing
long-range dependencies and global context via attention mechanisms. ViTs
support pretraining via self-supervised learning-addressing the common
limitation of labeled data in Arctic feature detection and outperform CNNs on
benchmark datasets. Arctic also poses challenges for model generalization,
especially when features with the same semantic class exhibit diverse spectral
characteristics. To address these issues for Arctic feature detection, we
integrate geospatial location embeddings into ViTs to improve adaptation across
regions. This work investigates: (1) the suitability of pre-trained ViTs as
feature extractors for high-resolution Arctic remote sensing tasks, and (2) the
benefit of combining image and location embeddings. Using previously published
datasets for Arctic feature detection, we evaluate our models on three
tasks-detecting ice-wedge polygons (IWP), retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS), and
human-built infrastructure. We empirically explore multiple configurations to
fuse image embeddings and location embeddings. Results show that ViTs with
location embeddings outperform prior CNN-based models on two of the three tasks
including F1 score increase from 0.84 to 0.92 for RTS detection, demonstrating
the potential of transformer-based models with spatial awareness for Arctic RS
applications.

### [211] [GaRA-SAM: Robustifying Segment Anything Model with Gated-Rank Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02882)
*Sohyun Lee,Yeho Kwon,Lukas Hoyer,Suha Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GaRA的轻量级适配器方法，用于提升Segment Anything Model (SAM)在输入退化情况下的鲁棒性，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升SAM在自动驾驶等高风险应用中的鲁棒性，同时保持其泛化能力。

Method: 引入动态调整权重矩阵有效秩的轻量级适配器（GaRA），通过门控模块实现输入感知的鲁棒化。

Result: GaRA-SAM在所有鲁棒分割基准测试中表现最佳，在ACDC数据集上IoU得分提升高达21.3%。

Conclusion: GaRA方法在不牺牲SAM泛化能力的前提下，显著提升了其对输入退化的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Improving robustness of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to input
degradations is critical for its deployment in high-stakes applications such as
autonomous driving and robotics. Our approach to this challenge prioritizes
three key aspects: first, parameter efficiency to maintain the inherent
generalization capability of SAM; second, fine-grained and input-aware
robustification to precisely address the input corruption; and third, adherence
to standard training protocols for ease of training. To this end, we propose
gated-rank adaptation (GaRA). GaRA introduces lightweight adapters into
intermediate layers of the frozen SAM, where each adapter dynamically adjusts
the effective rank of its weight matrix based on the input by selectively
activating (rank-1) components of the matrix using a learned gating module.
This adjustment enables fine-grained and input-aware robustification without
compromising the generalization capability of SAM. Our model, GaRA-SAM,
significantly outperforms prior work on all robust segmentation benchmarks. In
particular, it surpasses the previous best IoU score by up to 21.3\%p on ACDC,
a challenging real corrupted image dataset.

*Jonathan Astermark,Anders Heyden,Viktor Larsson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的匹配总结方案，显著加速了密集匹配的鲁棒两视图相对位姿估计，同时保持与完整密集匹配相当的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集匹配虽然提高了位姿估计的准确性和鲁棒性，但大量匹配点导致RANSAC中的鲁棒估计运行时间显著增加。

Method: 提出了一种高效的匹配总结方案，以减少匹配点数量，同时保持精度。

Result: 在标准基准数据集上验证，运行时间比完整密集匹配快10-100倍，且精度相当。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持精度的同时显著提升了运行效率，适用于密集匹配的鲁棒位姿估计。

Abstract: In this paper, we speed up robust two-view relative pose from dense
correspondences. Previous work has shown that dense matchers can significantly
improve both accuracy and robustness in the resulting pose. However, the large
number of matches comes with a significantly increased runtime during robust
estimation in RANSAC. To avoid this, we propose an efficient match
summarization scheme which provides comparable accuracy to using the full set
of dense matches, while having 10-100x faster runtime. We validate our approach
on standard benchmark datasets together with multiple state-of-the-art dense
matchers.

Motivation: 研究VLMs在真实、复杂环境中的适用性，验证其是否能有效完成目标驱动的探索任务。

Method: 引入FlySearch，一个3D户外逼真环境，设计三种难度场景测试VLMs表现，并分析失败原因。

Result: 现有VLMs在简单任务中表现不可靠，与人类差距随任务难度增加而扩大；部分问题可通过微调解决。

Conclusion: VLMs在复杂探索任务中仍有局限性，需进一步改进；作者公开了测试环境和代码。

Abstract: The real world is messy and unstructured. Uncovering critical information
often requires active, goal-driven exploration. It remains to be seen whether
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which recently emerged as a popular zero-shot
tool in many difficult tasks, can operate effectively in such conditions. In
this paper, we answer this question by introducing FlySearch, a 3D, outdoor,
photorealistic environment for searching and navigating to objects in complex
scenes. We define three sets of scenarios with varying difficulty and observe
that state-of-the-art VLMs cannot reliably solve even the simplest exploration
tasks, with the gap to human performance increasing as the tasks get harder. We
identify a set of central causes, ranging from vision hallucination, through
context misunderstanding, to task planning failures, and we show that some of
them can be addressed by finetuning. We publicly release the benchmark,
scenarios, and the underlying codebase.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出AnnoGuide基准，旨在通过专家定义的标注指南自动标注数据，减少人工标注需求。以nuScenes数据集为例，利用基础模型实现多模态少样本3D检测，性能显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据标注是机器学习应用中的关键但繁琐且昂贵的过程，研究如何通过自动化方法直接从标注指南生成标注，减少人工干预。

Method: 使用开源基础模型进行RGB图像目标检测与分割，将2D检测投影到3D空间，并通过聚类生成3D立方体标注。

Result: 通过逐步优化关键组件，3D检测mAP从12.1提升至21.9，但仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: AnnoGuide是一个开放且具有挑战性的问题，亟需开发基于LiDAR的基础模型。

Abstract: A crucial yet under-appreciated prerequisite in machine learning solutions
for real-applications is data annotation: human annotators are hired to
manually label data according to detailed, expert-crafted guidelines. This is
often a laborious, tedious, and costly process. To study methods for
facilitating data annotation, we introduce a new benchmark AnnoGuide:
Auto-Annotation from Annotation Guidelines. It aims to evaluate automated
methods for data annotation directly from expert-defined annotation guidelines,
eliminating the need for manual labeling. As a case study, we repurpose the
well-established nuScenes dataset, commonly used in autonomous driving
research, which provides comprehensive annotation guidelines for labeling LiDAR
point clouds with 3D cuboids across 18 object classes. These guidelines include
a few visual examples and textual descriptions, but no labeled 3D cuboids in
LiDAR data, making this a novel task of multi-modal few-shot 3D detection
without 3D annotations. The advances of powerful foundation models (FMs) make
AnnoGuide especially timely, as FMs offer promising tools to tackle its
challenges. We employ a conceptually straightforward pipeline that (1) utilizes
open-source FMs for object detection and segmentation in RGB images, (2)
projects 2D detections into 3D using known camera poses, and (3) clusters LiDAR
points within the frustum of each 2D detection to generate a 3D cuboid.
Starting with a non-learned solution that leverages off-the-shelf FMs, we
progressively refine key components and achieve significant performance
improvements, boosting 3D detection mAP from 12.1 to 21.9! Nevertheless, our
results highlight that AnnoGuide remains an open and challenging problem,
underscoring the urgent need for developing LiDAR-based FMs. We release our
code and models at GitHub: https://annoguide.github.io/annoguide3Dbenchmark

### [216] [MIND: Material Interface Generation from UDFs for Non-Manifold Surface Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02938)
*Xuhui Chen,Fei Hou,Wencheng Wang,Hong Qin,Ying He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIND算法直接从UDF生成非流形网格，解决了现有方法在拓扑结构和非流形几何上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法从UDF提取网格时存在拓扑伪影和非流形几何无法表示的问题。

Method: 通过空间分区和多标签全局场，结合UDF生成非流形网格。

Result: 实验表明MIND能鲁棒处理复杂非流形表面，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MIND为UDF提取非流形网格提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Unsigned distance fields (UDFs) are widely used in 3D deep learning due to
their ability to represent shapes with arbitrary topology. While prior work has
largely focused on learning UDFs from point clouds or multi-view images,
extracting meshes from UDFs remains challenging, as the learned fields rarely
attain exact zero distances. A common workaround is to reconstruct signed
distance fields (SDFs) locally from UDFs to enable surface extraction via
Marching Cubes. However, this often introduces topological artifacts such as
holes or spurious components. Moreover, local SDFs are inherently incapable of
representing non-manifold geometry, leading to complete failure in such cases.
To address this gap, we propose MIND (Material Interface from Non-manifold
Distance fields), a novel algorithm for generating material interfaces directly
from UDFs, enabling non-manifold mesh extraction from a global perspective. The
core of our method lies in deriving a meaningful spatial partitioning from the
UDF, where the target surface emerges as the interface between distinct
regions. We begin by computing a two-signed local field to distinguish the two
sides of manifold patches, and then extend this to a multi-labeled global field
capable of separating all sides of a non-manifold structure. By combining this
multi-labeled field with the input UDF, we construct material interfaces that
support non-manifold mesh extraction via a multi-labeled Marching Cubes
algorithm. Extensive experiments on UDFs generated from diverse data sources,
including point cloud reconstruction, multi-view reconstruction, and medial
axis transforms, demonstrate that our approach robustly handles complex
non-manifold surfaces and significantly outperforms existing methods.

Method: 使用共享特征适配器和slot attention模块，结合学生-教师架构优化适配器。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上优于集中式基线，学习到紧凑且通用的跨领域表示。

Conclusion: 联邦slot attention是分布式概念下可扩展无监督视觉表示学习的有效工具。

Abstract: Learning efficient visual representations across heterogeneous unlabeled
datasets remains a central challenge in federated learning. Effective federated
representations require features that are jointly informative across clients
while disentangling domain-specific factors without supervision. We introduce
FORLA, a novel framework for federated object-centric representation learning
and feature adaptation across clients using unsupervised slot attention. At the
core of our method is a shared feature adapter, trained collaboratively across
clients to adapt features from foundation models, and a shared slot attention
module that learns to reconstruct the adapted features. To optimize this
adapter, we design a two-branch student-teacher architecture. In each client, a
student decoder learns to reconstruct full features from foundation models,
while a teacher decoder reconstructs their adapted, low-dimensional
counterpart. The shared slot attention module bridges cross-domain learning by
aligning object-level representations across clients. Experiments in multiple
real-world datasets show that our framework not only outperforms centralized
baselines on object discovery but also learns a compact, universal
representation that generalizes well across domains. This work highlights
federated slot attention as an effective tool for scalable, unsupervised visual
representation learning from cross-domain data with distributed concepts.

Motivation: 推动AMD自动检测技术发展，评估AI在多模态数据中的表现，并为临床实践提供参考。

Method: 使用来自法国和阿尔及利亚的多模态数据集，设计两项任务：分类OCT图像演变和预测未来AMD进展。35支团队参与，前12名展示方法。

Result: AI在任务1（AMD进展测量）中表现与医生相当，但在任务2（预测未来演变）中表现不佳。

Conclusion: MARIO挑战赛为AMD监测设定了基准，显示AI在部分任务中潜力，但预测未来演变仍需改进。

Abstract: The MARIO challenge, held at MICCAI 2024, focused on advancing the automated
detection and monitoring of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) through the
analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Designed to evaluate
algorithmic performance in detecting neovascular activity changes within AMD,
the challenge incorporated unique multi-modal datasets. The primary dataset,
sourced from Brest, France, was used by participating teams to train and test
their models. The final ranking was determined based on performance on this
dataset. An auxiliary dataset from Algeria was used post-challenge to evaluate
population and device shifts from submitted solutions. Two tasks were involved
in the MARIO challenge. The first one was the classification of evolution
between two consecutive 2D OCT B-scans. The second one was the prediction of
future AMD evolution over three months for patients undergoing anti-vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. Thirty-five teams participated, with
the top 12 finalists presenting their methods. This paper outlines the
challenge's structure, tasks, data characteristics, and winning methodologies,
setting a benchmark for AMD monitoring using OCT, infrared imaging, and
clinical data (such as the number of visits, age, gender, etc.). The results of
this challenge indicate that artificial intelligence (AI) performs as well as a
physician in measuring AMD progression (Task 1) but is not yet able of
predicting future evolution (Task 2).

Abstract: Photography is the cornerstone of modern astronomical and space research.
However, most astronomical images captured by ground-based telescopes suffer
from atmospheric turbulence, resulting in degraded imaging quality. While
multi-frame strategies like lucky imaging can mitigate some effects, they
involve intensive data acquisition and complex manual processing. In this
paper, we propose AstroDiff, a generative restoration method that leverages
both the high-quality generative priors and restoration capabilities of
diffusion models to mitigate atmospheric turbulence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that AstroDiff outperforms existing state-of-the-art learning-based
methods in astronomical image turbulence mitigation, providing higher
perceptual quality and better structural fidelity under severe turbulence
conditions. Our code and additional results are available at

Conclusion: 多模态模型在DeepFake检测中具有潜力，DFBench和MoA-DF为未来研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, the realism of AI-generated
images has significantly improved, posing critical challenges for verifying
digital content authenticity. Current deepfake detection methods often depend
on datasets with limited generation models and content diversity that fail to
keep pace with the evolving complexity and increasing realism of the
AI-generated content. Large multimodal models (LMMs), widely adopted in various
vision tasks, have demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities, yet their
potential in deepfake detection remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap,
we present \textbf{DFBench}, a large-scale DeepFake Benchmark featuring (i)
broad diversity, including 540,000 images across real, AI-edited, and
AI-generated content, (ii) latest model, the fake images are generated by 12
state-of-the-art generation models, and (iii) bidirectional benchmarking and
evaluating for both the detection accuracy of deepfake detectors and the
evasion capability of generative models. Based on DFBench, we propose
\textbf{MoA-DF}, Mixture of Agents for DeepFake detection, leveraging a
combined probability strategy from multiple LMMs. MoA-DF achieves
state-of-the-art performance, further proving the effectiveness of leveraging
LMMs for deepfake detection. Database and codes are publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文提出Sparse-vDiT框架，通过利用vDiT中的注意力稀疏模式优化计算，显著提升视频生成的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频生成中注意力机制二次复杂度导致的推理延迟问题。

Method: 分析vDiT中的稀疏模式，设计模式优化的稀疏核和离线稀疏扩散搜索算法。

Result: 在多个vDiT模型中实现理论FLOP减少和实际推理加速，同时保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: vDiT中的潜在结构稀疏性可被系统利用于长视频合成。

Abstract: While Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved breakthroughs in video
generation, this long sequence generation task remains constrained by the
quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms, resulting in significant
inference latency. Through detailed analysis of attention maps in Video
Diffusion Transformer (vDiT), we identify three recurring sparsity patterns:
diagonal, multi-diagonal, and vertical-stripe structures. And even 3-6\%
attention heads can be skipped. Crucially, these patterns exhibit strong
layer-depth and head-position correlations but show limited dependence on the
input content. Leveraging these findings, we propose Sparse-vDiT, a sparsity
acceleration framework for vDiT comprising: 1) Pattern-optimized sparse kernels
that replace dense attention with computationally efficient implementations for
each identified sparsity pattern. 2) An offline sparse diffusion search
algorithm that selects the optimal sparse computation strategy per layer and
head via hardware-aware cost modeling. After determining the optimal
configuration, we fuse heads within the same layer that share the same
attention strategy, enhancing inference efficiency. Integrated into
state-of-the-art vDiT models (CogVideoX1.5, HunyuanVideo, and Wan2.1),
Sparse-vDiT achieves 2.09$\times$, 2.38$\times$, and 1.67$\times$ theoretical
FLOP reduction, and actual inference speedups of 1.76$\times$, 1.85$\times$,
and 1.58$\times$, respectively, while maintaining high visual fidelity, with
PSNR values reaching 24.13, 27.09, and 22.59. Our work demonstrates that latent
structural sparsity in vDiTs can be systematically exploited for long video
synthesis.

Method: 提出\sys技术，包括：1) 使用预训练图像描述模型初始化嵌入；2) 在潜在空间中进行反向工程优化；3) 通过嵌入到文本模型转换为文本。

Result: 在MS COCO、LAION和Flickr等数据集上的实验表明，\sys在图像相似性、文本对齐、提示可解释性和泛化性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: \sys在提示反转任务中表现出色，并展示了在跨概念图像合成、概念操作、进化多概念生成和无监督分割等任务中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation models~(e.g., Stable Diffusion) have achieved
significant advancements, enabling the creation of high-quality and realistic
images based on textual descriptions. Prompt inversion, the task of identifying
the textual prompt used to generate a specific artifact, holds significant
potential for applications including data attribution, model provenance, and
watermarking validation. Recent studies introduced a delayed projection scheme
to optimize for prompts representative of the vocabulary space, though
challenges in semantic fluency and efficiency remain. Advanced image captioning
models or visual large language models can generate highly interpretable
prompts, but they often lack in image similarity. In this paper, we propose a
prompt inversion technique called \sys for text-to-image diffusion models,
which includes initializing embeddings using a pre-trained image captioning
model, refining them through reverse-engineering in the latent space, and
converting them to texts using an embedding-to-text model. Our experiments on
the widely-used datasets, such as MS COCO, LAION, and Flickr, show that our
method outperforms existing methods in terms of image similarity, textual
alignment, prompt interpretability and generalizability. We further illustrate
the application of our generated prompts in tasks such as cross-concept image
synthesis, concept manipulation, evolutionary multi-concept generation and
unsupervised segmentation.

Conclusion: LEG-SLAM无需先验数据准备，适用于自主机器人、增强现实等领域，是实时语义3D SLAM的重要进展。

Abstract: Modern Gaussian Splatting methods have proven highly effective for real-time
photorealistic rendering of 3D scenes. However, integrating semantic
information into this representation remains a significant challenge,
especially in maintaining real-time performance for SLAM (Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping) applications. In this work, we introduce LEG-SLAM --
a novel approach that fuses an optimized Gaussian Splatting implementation with
visual-language feature extraction using DINOv2 followed by a learnable feature
compressor based on Principal Component Analysis, while enabling an online
dense SLAM. Our method simultaneously generates high-quality photorealistic
images and semantically labeled scene maps, achieving real-time scene
reconstruction with more than 10 fps on the Replica dataset and 18 fps on
ScanNet. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction speed while achieving competitive
rendering quality. The proposed system eliminates the need for prior data
preparation such as camera's ego motion or pre-computed static semantic maps.
With its potential applications in autonomous robotics, augmented reality, and
other interactive domains, LEG-SLAM represents a significant step forward in
real-time semantic 3D Gaussian-based SLAM. Project page:

Conclusion: ORV通过占用表示实现了高时间一致性和精确控制，为机器人学习任务提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Acquiring real-world robotic simulation data through teleoperation is
notoriously time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recently, action-driven
generative models have gained widespread adoption in robot learning and
simulation, as they eliminate safety concerns and reduce maintenance efforts.
However, the action sequences used in these methods often result in limited
control precision and poor generalization due to their globally coarse
alignment. To address these limitations, we propose ORV, an Occupancy-centric
Robot Video generation framework, which utilizes 4D semantic occupancy
sequences as a fine-grained representation to provide more accurate semantic
and geometric guidance for video generation. By leveraging occupancy-based
representations, ORV enables seamless translation of simulation data into
photorealistic robot videos, while ensuring high temporal consistency and
precise controllability. Furthermore, our framework supports the simultaneous
generation of multi-view videos of robot gripping operations - an important
capability for downstream robotic learning tasks. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that ORV consistently outperforms existing baseline methods
across various datasets and sub-tasks. Demo, Code and Model:

Motivation: 传统手术模拟工具缺乏真实感和解剖变异性，现有生成模型忽视细粒度控制。

Method: 提出SG2VID，首个基于扩散模型的视频生成方法，利用场景图实现精确合成和细粒度控制。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上表现优于现有方法，支持工具和解剖结构的精确控制。

Conclusion: SG2VID在生成增强和下游任务中表现优异，同时保留人类控制能力。

Abstract: Surgical simulation plays a pivotal role in training novice surgeons,
accelerating their learning curve and reducing intra-operative errors. However,
conventional simulation tools fall short in providing the necessary
photorealism and the variability of human anatomy. In response, current methods
are shifting towards generative model-based simulators. Yet, these approaches
primarily focus on using increasingly complex conditioning for precise
synthesis while neglecting the fine-grained human control aspect. To address
this gap, we introduce SG2VID, the first diffusion-based video model that
leverages Scene Graphs for both precise video synthesis and fine-grained human
control. We demonstrate SG2VID's capabilities across three public datasets
featuring cataract and cholecystectomy surgery. While SG2VID outperforms
previous methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, it also enables precise
synthesis, providing accurate control over tool and anatomy's size and
movement, entrance of new tools, as well as the overall scene layout. We
qualitatively motivate how SG2VID can be used for generative augmentation and
present an experiment demonstrating its ability to improve a downstream phase
detection task when the training set is extended with our synthetic videos.
Finally, to showcase SG2VID's ability to retain human control, we interact with
the Scene Graphs to generate new video samples depicting major yet rare
intra-operative irregularities.

Abstract: Human-human interaction generation has garnered significant attention in
motion synthesis due to its vital role in understanding humans as social
beings. However, existing methods typically rely on transformer-based
architectures, which often face challenges related to scalability and
efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a novel, efficient human-human
interaction generation method based on the Mamba framework, designed to meet
the demands of effectively capturing long-sequence dependencies while providing
real-time feedback. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive spatio-temporal
Mamba framework that utilizes two parallel SSM branches with an adaptive
mechanism to integrate the spatial and temporal features of motion sequences.
To further enhance the model's ability to capture dependencies within
individual motion sequences and the interactions between different individual
sequences, we develop two key modules: the self-adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba
module and the cross-adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba module, enabling efficient
feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art results on two interaction datasets with remarkable quality
and efficiency. Compared to the baseline method InterGen, our approach not only
improves accuracy but also requires a minimal parameter size of just 66M ,only
36% of InterGen's, while achieving an average inference speed of 0.57 seconds,
which is 46% of InterGen's execution time.

Motivation: 解决CNN在视觉扰动和域外图像中的脆弱性问题，通过模仿生物视觉系统提升模型鲁棒性。

Method: 引入EVNets，结合VOneBlock和SubcorticalBlock，优化子皮层响应对齐，并测试其性能。

Result: EVNets在V1对齐性、形状偏好和鲁棒性测试中表现优异，提升了8.5%。结合数据增强后性能进一步提升7.3%。

Conclusion: EVNets展示了架构改进与数据增强的互补性，为提升CNN鲁棒性提供了新方向。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on object recognition achieve
high task performance but continue to exhibit vulnerability under a range of
visual perturbations and out-of-domain images, when compared with biological
vision. Prior work has demonstrated that coupling a standard CNN with a
front-end block (VOneBlock) that mimics the primate primary visual cortex (V1)
can improve overall model robustness. Expanding on this, we introduce Early
Vision Networks (EVNets), a new class of hybrid CNNs that combine the VOneBlock
with a novel SubcorticalBlock, whose architecture draws from computational
models in neuroscience and is parameterized to maximize alignment with
subcortical responses reported across multiple experimental studies. Without
being optimized to do so, the assembly of the SubcorticalBlock with the
VOneBlock improved V1 alignment across most standard V1 benchmarks, and better
modeled extra-classical receptive field phenomena. In addition, EVNets exhibit
stronger emergent shape bias and overperform the base CNN architecture by 8.5%
on an aggregate benchmark of robustness evaluations, including adversarial
perturbations, common corruptions, and domain shifts. Finally, we show that
EVNets can be further improved when paired with a state-of-the-art data
augmentation technique, surpassing the performance of the isolated data
augmentation approach by 7.3% on our robustness benchmark. This result reveals
complementary benefits between changes in architecture to better mimic biology
and training-based machine learning approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比语言-图像预训练方法无法原生处理多模态输入，需额外模块融合特征，限制了性能。

Method: 使用单一Transformer模型处理扩展的文本和图像标记词汇，实现早期融合。

Result: FuseLIP在多模态任务（如VQA和文本引导图像检索）中表现优异，单模态任务与基线相当。

Conclusion: FuseLIP通过早期融合实现了更丰富的多模态表示，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Contrastive language-image pre-training aligns the features of text-image
pairs in a common latent space via distinct encoders for each modality. While
this approach achieves impressive performance in several zero-shot tasks, it
cannot natively handle multimodal inputs, i.e., encoding image and text into a
single feature vector. As a remedy, it is common practice to use additional
modules to merge the features extracted by the unimodal encoders. In this work,
we present FuseLIP, an alternative architecture for multimodal embedding.
Leveraging recent progress in discrete image tokenizers, we propose to use a
single transformer model which operates on an extended vocabulary of text and
image tokens. This early fusion approach allows the different modalities to
interact at each depth of encoding and obtain richer representations compared
to common late fusion. We collect new datasets for multimodal pre-training and
evaluation, designing challenging tasks for multimodal encoder models. We show
that FuseLIP outperforms other approaches in multimodal embedding tasks such as
VQA and text-guided image transformation retrieval, while being comparable to
baselines on unimodal tasks.

Conclusion: EgoVLM通过生成推理轨迹增强可解释性，适用于下游应用，并提出了基于关键帧的奖励方法，为未来研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Emerging embodied AI applications, such as wearable cameras and autonomous
agents, have underscored the need for robust reasoning from first person video
streams. We introduce EgoVLM, a vision-language model specifically designed to
integrate visual comprehension and spatial-temporal reasoning within egocentric
video contexts. EgoVLM is fine-tuned via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), a reinforcement learning method adapted to align model outputs with
human-like reasoning steps. Following DeepSeek R1-Zero's approach, we directly
tune using RL without any supervised fine-tuning phase on chain-of-thought
(CoT) data. We evaluate EgoVLM on egocentric video question answering
benchmarks and show that domain-specific training substantially improves
performance over general-purpose VLMs. Our EgoVLM-3B, trained exclusively on
non-CoT egocentric data, outperforms the base Qwen2.5-VL 3B and 7B models by
14.33 and 13.87 accuracy points on the EgoSchema benchmark, respectively. By
explicitly generating reasoning traces, EgoVLM enhances interpretability,
making it well-suited for downstream applications. Furthermore, we introduce a
novel keyframe-based reward that incorporates salient frame selection to guide
reinforcement learning optimization. This reward formulation opens a promising
avenue for future exploration in temporally grounded egocentric reasoning.

Result: 实验表明，DyTact在动态接触估计精度和新视角合成质量上达到领先水平，同时优化速度快且内存高效。

Conclusion: DyTact为非侵入式动态接触捕捉提供了高效解决方案，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic hand-object contacts is essential for realistic
manipulation in AI character animation, XR, and robotics, yet it remains
challenging due to heavy occlusions, complex surface details, and limitations
in existing capture techniques. In this paper, we introduce DyTact, a
markerless capture method for accurately capturing dynamic contact in
hand-object manipulations in a non-intrusive manner. Our approach leverages a
dynamic, articulated representation based on 2D Gaussian surfels to model
complex manipulations. By binding these surfels to MANO meshes, DyTact
harnesses the inductive bias of template models to stabilize and accelerate
optimization. A refinement module addresses time-dependent high-frequency
deformations, while a contact-guided adaptive sampling strategy selectively
increases surfel density in contact regions to handle heavy occlusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DyTact not only achieves
state-of-the-art dynamic contact estimation accuracy but also significantly
improves novel view synthesis quality, all while operating with fast
optimization and efficient memory usage. Project Page:

Existing approaches and datasets predominantly focus on static scenes or rigid

Both capture a wide variety of non-rigid motion types across diverse
environments, human figures, and object categories. The dataset is constructed
using motion-guided data generation, layered compositing techniques, and
automated captioning to ensure diversity, realism, and semantic coherence. We
further conduct a comprehensive evaluation of recent instruction-based image
editing methods from both academic and commercial domains.

Conclusion: 图像令牌连续性对ViT泛化能力有重要影响，破坏连续性可提升跨域少样本学习性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved remarkable success due to its
large-scale pretraining on general domains, but it still faces challenges when
applying it to downstream distant domains that have only scarce training data,
which gives rise to the Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CDFSL) task. Inspired
by Self-Attention's insensitivity to token orders, we find an interesting
phenomenon neglected in current works: disrupting the continuity of image
tokens (i.e., making pixels not smoothly transited across patches) in ViT leads
to a noticeable performance decline in the general (source) domain but only a
marginal decrease in downstream target domains. This questions the role of
image tokens' continuity in ViT's generalization under large domain gaps. In
this paper, we delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation. We find
continuity aids ViT in learning larger spatial patterns, which are harder to
transfer than smaller ones, enlarging domain distances. Meanwhile, it implies
that only smaller patterns within each patch could be transferred under extreme
domain gaps. Based on this interpretation, we further propose a simple yet
effective method for CDFSL that better disrupts the continuity of image tokens,
encouraging the model to rely less on large patterns and more on smaller ones.
Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method in reducing domain
gaps and outperforming state-of-the-art works. Codes and models are available

Abstract: Large-scale delineation of individual trees from remote sensing imagery is
crucial to the advancement of ecological research, particularly as climate
change and other environmental factors rapidly transform forest landscapes
across the world. Current RGB tree segmentation methods rely on training
specialized machine learning models with labeled tree datasets. While these
learning-based approaches can outperform manual data collection when accurate,
the existing models still depend on training data that's hard to scale. In this
paper, we investigate the efficacy of using a state-of-the-art image
segmentation model, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), in a zero-shot manner for
individual tree detection and segmentation. We evaluate a pretrained SAM2 model
on two tasks in this domain: (1) zero-shot segmentation and (2) zero-shot
transfer by using predictions from an existing tree detection model as prompts.
Our results suggest that SAM2 not only has impressive generalization
capabilities, but also can form a natural synergy with specialized methods
trained on in-domain labeled data. We find that applying large pretrained
models to problems in remote sensing is a promising avenue for future progress.

Motivation: 基础模型（如CLIP）在零样本任务中表现优异，但可能从噪声数据中继承有害知识，现有遗忘方法无法满足细粒度遗忘需求。

Method: 提出三阶段方法：遗忘阶段（微调目标知识）、提醒阶段（恢复保留样本性能）、恢复阶段（通过模型汤恢复零样本能力），并引入知识蒸馏处理分布差异。

Conclusion: 该方法为细粒度知识遗忘提供了有效解决方案，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated impressive zero-shot
performance across various tasks by leveraging large-scale, unsupervised
pre-training. However, they often inherit harmful or unwanted knowledge from
noisy internet-sourced datasets, compromising their reliability in real-world
applications. Existing model unlearning methods either rely on access to
pre-trained datasets or focus on coarse-grained unlearning (e.g., entire
classes), leaving a critical gap for fine-grained unlearning. In this paper, we
address the challenging scenario of selectively forgetting specific portions of
knowledge within a class, without access to pre-trained data, while preserving
the model's overall performance. We propose a novel three-stage approach that
progressively unlearns targeted knowledge while mitigating over-forgetting. It
consists of (1) a forgetting stage to fine-tune the CLIP on samples to be
forgotten, (2) a reminding stage to restore performance on retained samples,
and (3) a restoring stage to recover zero-shot capabilities using model
souping. Additionally, we introduce knowledge distillation to handle the
distribution disparity between forgetting, retaining samples, and unseen
pre-trained data. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-1K, and style
datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively unlearns specific subgroups
while maintaining strong zero-shot performance on semantically similar
subgroups and other categories, significantly outperforming baseline unlearning
methods, which lose effectiveness under the CLIP unlearning setting.

Motivation: 现有插值方法缺乏3D几何指导，难以生成复杂人体动作的合理结果，且对合成动态的控制有限。

Method: 提出PoseFuse3D-KI框架，结合3D人体信号（通过SMPL-X编码器和融合网络）到扩散过程中。

Conclusion: PoseFuse3D-KI显著提高了插值保真度，为可控人体关键帧插值提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing interpolation methods use pre-trained video diffusion priors to
generate intermediate frames between sparsely sampled keyframes. In the absence
of 3D geometric guidance, these methods struggle to produce plausible results
for complex, articulated human motions and offer limited control over the
synthesized dynamics. In this paper, we introduce PoseFuse3D Keyframe
Interpolator (PoseFuse3D-KI), a novel framework that integrates 3D human
guidance signals into the diffusion process for Controllable Human-centric
Keyframe Interpolation (CHKI). To provide rich spatial and structural cues for
interpolation, our PoseFuse3D, a 3D-informed control model, features a novel
SMPL-X encoder that transforms 3D geometry and shape into the 2D latent
conditioning space, alongside a fusion network that integrates these 3D cues
with 2D pose embeddings. For evaluation, we build CHKI-Video, a new dataset
annotated with both 2D poses and 3D SMPL-X parameters. We show that
PoseFuse3D-KI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on
CHKI-Video, achieving a 9% improvement in PSNR and a 38% reduction in LPIPS.

Motivation: 现有的一致性模型在加速视频扩散模型时会导致时间一致性和外观细节的严重退化，原因是蒸馏过程中不同时间步的优化梯度和损失贡献存在显著差异。

Method: 提出DCM模型，包含语义专家和细节专家，分别学习语义布局与运动、精细细节优化；引入时间相干损失和GAN/特征匹配损失以提升性能。

Result: DCM在显著减少采样步数的同时，实现了最先进的视觉质量。

Conclusion: 专家分工的蒸馏策略有效解决了视频扩散模型中的梯度冲突问题，提升了时间一致性和细节质量。

Abstract: Diffusion Models have achieved remarkable results in video synthesis but
require iterative denoising steps, leading to substantial computational
overhead. Consistency Models have made significant progress in accelerating
diffusion models. However, directly applying them to video diffusion models
often results in severe degradation of temporal consistency and appearance
details. In this paper, by analyzing the training dynamics of Consistency
Models, we identify a key conflicting learning dynamics during the distillation
process: there is a significant discrepancy in the optimization gradients and
loss contributions across different timesteps. This discrepancy prevents the
distilled student model from achieving an optimal state, leading to compromised
temporal consistency and degraded appearance details. To address this issue, we
propose a parameter-efficient \textbf{Dual-Expert Consistency Model~(DCM)},
where a semantic expert focuses on learning semantic layout and motion, while a
detail expert specializes in fine detail refinement. Furthermore, we introduce
Temporal Coherence Loss to improve motion consistency for the semantic expert
and apply GAN and Feature Matching Loss to enhance the synthesis quality of the
detail expert.Our approach achieves state-of-the-art visual quality with
significantly reduced sampling steps, demonstrating the effectiveness of expert
specialization in video diffusion model distillation. Our code and models are

*Lu Qiu,Yizhuo Li,Yuying Ge,Yixiao Ge,Ying Shan,Xihui Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnimeShooter是一个参考引导的多镜头动画数据集，填补了现有数据集的不足，通过自动化流程提供分层注释和视觉一致性。AnimeShooterGen利用多模态大语言模型和视频扩散模型，展示了数据集在生成连贯动画视频中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公共数据集缺乏角色参考图像和连贯的多镜头视频生成能力，限制了AI生成内容在动画制作中的应用。

Method: 提出AnimeShooter数据集，包含分层注释和视觉一致性；开发AnimeShooterGen模型，结合MLLM和视频扩散模型生成连贯视频。

Result: 实验表明，基于AnimeShooter训练的模型在跨镜头视觉一致性和参考视觉指导方面表现优越。

Conclusion: AnimeShooter为连贯动画视频生成提供了有价值的资源，推动了AIGC在动画领域的应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content (AIGC) have significantly accelerated
animation production. To produce engaging animations, it is essential to
generate coherent multi-shot video clips with narrative scripts and character
references. However, existing public datasets primarily focus on real-world
scenarios with global descriptions, and lack reference images for consistent
character guidance. To bridge this gap, we present AnimeShooter, a
reference-guided multi-shot animation dataset. AnimeShooter features
comprehensive hierarchical annotations and strong visual consistency across
shots through an automated pipeline. Story-level annotations provide an
overview of the narrative, including the storyline, key scenes, and main
character profiles with reference images, while shot-level annotations
decompose the story into consecutive shots, each annotated with scene,
characters, and both narrative and descriptive visual captions. Additionally, a
dedicated subset, AnimeShooter-audio, offers synchronized audio tracks for each
shot, along with audio descriptions and sound sources. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of AnimeShooter and establish a baseline for the reference-guided
multi-shot video generation task, we introduce AnimeShooterGen, which leverages
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and video diffusion models. The
reference image and previously generated shots are first processed by MLLM to
produce representations aware of both reference and context, which are then
used as the condition for the diffusion model to decode the subsequent shot.
Experimental results show that the model trained on AnimeShooter achieves
superior cross-shot visual consistency and adherence to reference visual
guidance, which highlight the value of our dataset for coherent animated video
generation.

*Zidong Wang,Lei Bai,Xiangyu Yue,Wanli Ouyang,Yiyuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为原生分辨率图像合成的新方法，通过NiT架构实现任意分辨率和宽高比的图像生成，突破了传统固定分辨率方法的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定分辨率的图像生成方法无法灵活处理不同分辨率和宽高比的图像，限制了生成模型的适用范围。

Method: 设计了Native-resolution diffusion Transformer (NiT)，通过处理可变长度视觉标记，直接在去噪过程中建模不同分辨率和宽高比。

Result: NiT在ImageNet-256x256和512x512基准测试中达到最优性能，并展示了出色的零样本泛化能力，能生成未见的高分辨率和多样宽高比的图像。

Conclusion: 原生分辨率建模在视觉生成模型与先进LLM方法之间架起了桥梁，展示了巨大潜力。

Abstract: We introduce native-resolution image synthesis, a novel generative modeling
paradigm that enables the synthesis of images at arbitrary resolutions and
aspect ratios. This approach overcomes the limitations of conventional
fixed-resolution, square-image methods by natively handling variable-length
visual tokens, a core challenge for traditional techniques. To this end, we
introduce the Native-resolution diffusion Transformer (NiT), an architecture
designed to explicitly model varying resolutions and aspect ratios within its
denoising process. Free from the constraints of fixed formats, NiT learns
intrinsic visual distributions from images spanning a broad range of
resolutions and aspect ratios. Notably, a single NiT model simultaneously
achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both ImageNet-256x256 and 512x512
benchmarks. Surprisingly, akin to the robust zero-shot capabilities seen in
advanced large language models, NiT, trained solely on ImageNet, demonstrates
excellent zero-shot generalization performance. It successfully generates
high-fidelity images at previously unseen high resolutions (e.g., 1536 x 1536)
and diverse aspect ratios (e.g., 16:9, 3:1, 4:3), as shown in Figure 1. These
findings indicate the significant potential of native-resolution modeling as a
bridge between visual generative modeling and advanced LLM methodologies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniSpatial是一个基于认知心理学的空间推理基准测试，涵盖四大类50个子类，包含1.5K问答对，揭示了现有视觉语言模型在空间理解上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间推理是认知心理学的关键，但现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在此方面表现不足，尤其是对复杂空间关系的理解。

Method: 通过互联网数据爬取和人工标注，构建了OmniSpatial基准测试，包含动态推理、复杂空间逻辑、空间交互和视角转换四大类。

Result: 实验表明，现有VLMs和空间理解模型在综合空间理解上存在显著局限。

Conclusion: OmniSpatial为未来研究提供了挑战和方向，揭示了模型改进的空间。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a key aspect of cognitive psychology and remains a major
bottleneck for current vision-language models (VLMs). While extensive research
has aimed to evaluate or improve VLMs' understanding of basic spatial
relations, such as distinguishing left from right, near from far, and object
counting, these tasks represent only the most fundamental level of spatial
reasoning. In this work, we introduce OmniSpatial, a comprehensive and
challenging benchmark for spatial reasoning, grounded in cognitive psychology.
OmniSpatial covers four major categories: dynamic reasoning, complex spatial
logic, spatial interaction, and perspective-taking, with 50 fine-grained
subcategories. Through Internet data crawling and careful manual annotation, we
construct over 1.5K question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments show that both
open- and closed-source VLMs, as well as existing reasoning and spatial
understanding models, exhibit significant limitations in comprehensive spatial
understanding. We further analyze failure cases and propose potential
directions for future research.

Motivation: 现有SVG处理基准测试覆盖不足、复杂度分层缺失且评估范式碎片化，SVGenius旨在填补这一空白。

Method: SVGenius基于24个应用领域的真实数据，通过8个任务类别和18个指标评估模型，涵盖不同规模、架构和训练范式的22个模型。

Result: 专有模型表现优于开源模型，但所有模型在复杂度增加时性能下降；推理增强训练比单纯扩展更有效，风格迁移是最具挑战性的能力。

Conclusion: SVGenius为SVG处理提供了首个系统评估框架，为开发更强大的向量图形模型和自动化图形设计应用提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs have shown promising
capabilities for SVG processing, yet existing benchmarks suffer from limited
real-world coverage, lack of complexity stratification, and fragmented
evaluation paradigms. We introduce SVGenius, a comprehensive benchmark
comprising 2,377 queries across three progressive dimensions: understanding,
editing, and generation. Built on real-world data from 24 application domains
with systematic complexity stratification, SVGenius evaluates models through 8
task categories and 18 metrics. We assess 22 mainstream models spanning
different scales, architectures, training paradigms, and accessibility levels.
Our analysis reveals that while proprietary models significantly outperform
open-source counterparts, all models exhibit systematic performance degradation
with increasing complexity, indicating fundamental limitations in current
approaches; however, reasoning-enhanced training proves more effective than
pure scaling for overcoming these limitations, though style transfer remains
the most challenging capability across all model types. SVGenius establishes
the first systematic evaluation framework for SVG processing, providing crucial
insights for developing more capable vector graphics models and advancing
automated graphic design applications. Appendix and supplementary materials

Motivation: 现有方法依赖显式相机参数序列，操作繁琐，尤其对于复杂相机运动。

Method: CamCloneMaster框架通过参考视频复制相机运动，支持Image-to-Video和Video-to-Video任务，并引入Camera Clone Dataset。

Result: 实验和用户研究表明，CamCloneMaster在相机可控性和视觉质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CamCloneMaster提供了一种更直观、高效的相机控制方法，适用于多样化场景和任务。

Abstract: Camera control is crucial for generating expressive and cinematic videos.
Existing methods rely on explicit sequences of camera parameters as control
conditions, which can be cumbersome for users to construct, particularly for
intricate camera movements. To provide a more intuitive camera control method,
we propose CamCloneMaster, a framework that enables users to replicate camera
movements from reference videos without requiring camera parameters or
test-time fine-tuning. CamCloneMaster seamlessly supports reference-based
camera control for both Image-to-Video and Video-to-Video tasks within a
unified framework. Furthermore, we present the Camera Clone Dataset, a
large-scale synthetic dataset designed for camera clone learning, encompassing
diverse scenes, subjects, and camera movements. Extensive experiments and user
studies demonstrate that CamCloneMaster outperforms existing methods in terms
of both camera controllability and visual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Context-as-Memory的方法，利用历史上下文作为视频生成的记忆，通过简单设计显著提升了长视频生成的场景一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成长视频时因历史上下文利用不足，导致场景一致性较差。

Method: 1. 以帧格式存储上下文；2. 通过沿帧维度拼接上下文和待预测帧进行条件生成。此外，引入Memory Retrieval模块通过相机姿态的FOV重叠选择相关上下文帧。

Result: 实验表明，Context-as-Memory在长视频生成中优于现有方法，并能泛化到未训练的开域场景。

Conclusion: Context-as-Memory通过高效利用历史上下文，显著提升了长视频生成的场景一致性和计算效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in interactive video generation have shown promising results,
yet existing approaches struggle with scene-consistent memory capabilities in
long video generation due to limited use of historical context. In this work,
we propose Context-as-Memory, which utilizes historical context as memory for
video generation. It includes two simple yet effective designs: (1) storing
context in frame format without additional post-processing; (2) conditioning by
concatenating context and frames to be predicted along the frame dimension at
the input, requiring no external control modules. Furthermore, considering the
enormous computational overhead of incorporating all historical context, we
propose the Memory Retrieval module to select truly relevant context frames by
determining FOV (Field of View) overlap between camera poses, which
significantly reduces the number of candidate frames without substantial
information loss. Experiments demonstrate that Context-as-Memory achieves
superior memory capabilities in interactive long video generation compared to
SOTAs, even generalizing effectively to open-domain scenarios not seen during
training. The link of our project page is https://context-as-memory.github.io/.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了MERIT数据集和Coral框架，解决了多条件语义检索的局限性，性能提升45.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集和模型在多条件语义检索中存在不足，无法充分利用视觉信息。

Method: 提出MERIT数据集和Coral框架，结合嵌入重建和对比学习。

Result: Coral性能提升45.9%，并在8个基准测试中验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 为多条件语义检索的未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Semantic retrieval is crucial for modern applications yet remains
underexplored in current research. Existing datasets are limited to single
languages, single images, or singular retrieval conditions, often failing to
fully exploit the expressive capacity of visual information as evidenced by
maintained performance when images are replaced with captions. However,
practical retrieval scenarios frequently involve interleaved multi-condition
queries with multiple images. Hence, this paper introduces MERIT, the first
multilingual dataset for interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval,
comprising 320,000 queries with 135,000 products in 5 languages, covering 7
distinct product categories. Extensive experiments on MERIT identify existing
models's limitation: focusing solely on global semantic information while
neglecting specific conditional elements in queries. Consequently, we propose
Coral, a novel fine-tuning framework that adapts pre-trained MLLMs by
integrating embedding reconstruction to preserve fine-grained conditional
elements and contrastive learning to extract comprehensive global semantics.
Experiments demonstrate that Coral achieves a 45.9% performance improvement
over conventional approaches on MERIT, with strong generalization capabilities
validated across 8 established retrieval benchmarks. Collectively, our
contributions - a novel dataset, identification of critical limitations in
existing approaches, and an innovative fine-tuning framework - establish a
foundation for future research in interleaved multi-condition semantic
retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一模型在视觉语言理解和文本生成图像方面表现优异，但在图像感知和操作任务上存在局限，而GPT-4o-Image的成功启发了基于语义特征的新方法。

Method: 提出UniWorld框架，利用视觉语言模型和对比语义编码器提取语义特征，构建统一生成模型。

Result: UniWorld在图像编辑任务上超越BAGEL，同时在图像理解和生成任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: UniWorld展示了基于语义特征的统一框架在图像感知和操作任务中的潜力，并开源了模型及相关资源。

Abstract: Although existing unified models deliver strong performance on
vision-language understanding and text-to-image generation, their models are
limited in exploring image perception and manipulation tasks, which are
urgently desired by users for wide applications. Recently, OpenAI released
their powerful GPT-4o-Image model for comprehensive image perception and
manipulation, achieving expressive capability and attracting community
interests. By observing the performance of GPT-4o-Image in our carefully
constructed experiments, we infer that GPT-4o-Image leverages features
extracted by semantic encoders instead of VAE, while VAEs are considered
essential components in many image manipulation models. Motivated by such
inspiring observations, we present a unified generative framework named
UniWorld based on semantic features provided by powerful visual-language models
and contrastive semantic encoders. As a result, we build a strong unified model
using only 1% amount of BAGEL's data, which consistently outperforms BAGEL on
image editing benchmarks. UniWorld also maintains competitive image
understanding and generation capabilities, achieving strong performance across
multiple image perception tasks. We fully open-source our models, including
model weights, training and evaluation scripts, and datasets.

Motivation: 解决不同视觉模态（如RGB与深度图）间像素对应问题，避免显式光一致性假设。

Method: 扩展对比随机游走框架，学习跨模态和模态内匹配的循环一致特征。

Result: 在几何和语义匹配任务中表现优异，如RGB-深度、RGB-热成像匹配。

Conclusion: 模型简单高效，无需标注数据，适用于多种跨模态任务。

Abstract: We present a method for finding cross-modal space-time correspondences. Given
two images from different visual modalities, such as an RGB image and a depth
map, our model identifies which pairs of pixels correspond to the same physical
points in the scene. To solve this problem, we extend the contrastive random
walk framework to simultaneously learn cycle-consistent feature representations
for both cross-modal and intra-modal matching. The resulting model is simple
and has no explicit photo-consistency assumptions. It can be trained entirely
using unlabeled data, without the need for any spatially aligned multimodal
image pairs. We evaluate our method on both geometric and semantic
correspondence tasks. For geometric matching, we consider challenging tasks
such as RGB-to-depth and RGB-to-thermal matching (and vice versa); for semantic
matching, we evaluate on photo-sketch and cross-style image alignment. Our
method achieves strong performance across all benchmarks.

TL;DR: IllumiCraft是一个端到端的扩散框架，通过整合光照、外观和几何线索，生成高质量且时间一致的视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在控制场景光照和视觉外观时缺乏几何线索的显式集成。

Method: IllumiCraft接受HDR视频地图、合成重光照帧和3D点轨迹作为输入，在统一扩散架构中整合这些线索。

Result: 生成的视频具有时间一致性，支持背景和文本条件重光照，且保真度优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IllumiCraft通过多线索整合，显著提升了可控视频生成的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Although diffusion-based models can generate high-quality and high-resolution
video sequences from textual or image inputs, they lack explicit integration of
geometric cues when controlling scene lighting and visual appearance across
frames. To address this limitation, we propose IllumiCraft, an end-to-end
diffusion framework accepting three complementary inputs: (1)
high-dynamic-range (HDR) video maps for detailed lighting control; (2)
synthetically relit frames with randomized illumination changes (optionally
paired with a static background reference image) to provide appearance cues;
and (3) 3D point tracks that capture precise 3D geometry information. By
integrating the lighting, appearance, and geometry cues within a unified
diffusion architecture, IllumiCraft generates temporally coherent videos
aligned with user-defined prompts. It supports background-conditioned and
text-conditioned video relighting and provides better fidelity than existing
controllable video generation methods. Project Page:

Motivation: 企业级对话AI面临多样查询、高延迟、幻觉和动态知识整合的挑战，需要更高效且准确的解决方案。

Method: 采用混合框架，结合RAG和预设回答，通过对话上下文管理和反馈循环优化查询路由和响应覆盖。

Result: 实验显示，该框架在准确性（95%）和延迟（180ms）上优于纯RAG和意图系统。

Conclusion: 该框架为企业级对话AI提供了可扩展且自适应的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and large language model
(LLM)-powered chatbots have significantly advanced conversational AI by
combining generative capabilities with external knowledge retrieval. Despite
their success, enterprise-scale deployments face critical challenges, including
diverse user queries, high latency, hallucinations, and difficulty integrating
frequently updated domain-specific knowledge. This paper introduces a novel
hybrid framework that integrates RAG with intent-based canned responses,
leveraging predefined high-confidence responses for efficiency while
dynamically routing complex or ambiguous queries to the RAG pipeline. Our
framework employs a dialogue context manager to ensure coherence in multi-turn
interactions and incorporates a feedback loop to refine intents, dynamically
adjust confidence thresholds, and expand response coverage over time.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a balance
of high accuracy (95\%) and low latency (180ms), outperforming RAG and
intent-based systems across diverse query types, positioning it as a scalable
and adaptive solution for enterprise conversational AI applications.

Result: 在电影和购物数据集上验证，生成可解释的文本用户画像，用于预测用户偏好行为。

Conclusion: DHRs能有效捕捉历史细节和预测结构，支持任务相关查询和决策。

Abstract: Effective decision making in partially observable environments requires
compressing long interaction histories into informative representations. We
introduce Descriptive History Representations (DHRs): sufficient statistics
characterized by their capacity to answer relevant questions about past
interactions and potential future outcomes. DHRs focus on capturing the
information necessary to address task-relevant queries, providing a structured
way to summarize a history for optimal control. We propose a multi-agent
learning framework, involving representation, decision, and question-asking
components, optimized using a joint objective that balances reward maximization
with the representation's ability to answer informative questions. This yields
representations that capture the salient historical details and predictive
structures needed for effective decision making. We validate our approach on
user modeling tasks with public movie and shopping datasets, generating
interpretable textual user profiles which serve as sufficient statistics for
predicting preference-driven behavior of users.

Method: 提出UCCT理论，将LLM视为无意识底层结构，通过语义锚定（如提示、角色、交互）实现任务相关推理。

Result: 形式化语义锚定为概率相变（Threshold-Crossing Dynamics Theorem），支持UCCT模型。

Conclusion: AGI需通过整合LLM而非抛弃它们，构建具备推理、调节和适应能力的系统。

Abstract: Few-shot learning in large language models (LLMs) reveals a deep paradox:
Some tasks generalize from minimal examples, while others require extensive
supervision. We address this through the Unified Cognitive Consciousness Theory
(UCCT), which reframes LLMs not as incomplete agents, but as unconscious
substrates, repositories of latent linguistic and conceptual patterns that
operate without explicit semantics or goal-directed reasoning. In this view,
LLMs are not broken approximations of cognition, but necessary and foundational
components of general intelligence. Semantic anchoring, through prompts, roles,
and interaction, acts as a conscious control layer, binding latent structure to
task-relevant meaning and enabling coherent reasoning. UCCT offers a unifying
account of prompting, fine-tuning, retrieval, and multi-agent coordination, all
grounded in probabilistic alignment between unconscious representation and
external control. To support this model, we present the Threshold-Crossing
Dynamics Theorem, which formalizes semantic anchoring as a probabilistic phase
transition. But the central claim remains architectural: AGI will not emerge by
discarding LLMs, but by aligning and integrating them into systems that reason,
regulate, and adapt together.

Motivation: 探讨代理AI系统中LLMs的局限性，提出SLMs更适合特定任务，以降低成本和资源浪费。

Method: 基于SLMs的能力、代理系统架构和经济性分析，提出LLM-to-SLM转换算法。

Result: SLMs在代理系统中表现更优且经济，异构代理系统是通用对话能力的理想选择。

Conclusion: SLMs是代理AI的未来，呼吁行业讨论资源有效利用和降低成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often praised for exhibiting near-human
performance on a wide range of tasks and valued for their ability to hold a
general conversation. The rise of agentic AI systems is, however, ushering in a
mass of applications in which language models perform a small number of
specialized tasks repetitively and with little variation.
  Here we lay out the position that small language models (SLMs) are
sufficiently powerful, inherently more suitable, and necessarily more
economical for many invocations in agentic systems, and are therefore the
future of agentic AI. Our argumentation is grounded in the current level of
capabilities exhibited by SLMs, the common architectures of agentic systems,
and the economy of LM deployment. We further argue that in situations where
general-purpose conversational abilities are essential, heterogeneous agentic
systems (i.e., agents invoking multiple different models) are the natural
choice. We discuss the potential barriers for the adoption of SLMs in agentic
systems and outline a general LLM-to-SLM agent conversion algorithm.
  Our position, formulated as a value statement, highlights the significance of
the operational and economic impact even a partial shift from LLMs to SLMs is
to have on the AI agent industry. We aim to stimulate the discussion on the
effective use of AI resources and hope to advance the efforts to lower the
costs of AI of the present day. Calling for both contributions to and critique
of our position, we commit to publishing all such correspondence at

TL;DR: ReAP通过自我反思利用过往经验，显著提升了网络导航代理的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网络导航代理缺乏记忆能力，导致重复错误且无法从过往经验中学习。

Method: 引入Reflection-Augment Planning (ReAP)，利用成功和失败的经验进行自我反思。

Result: 整体性能提升11点，在之前失败的任务上提升29点。

Conclusion: 反思能力可迁移至不同网络导航任务。

Abstract: Web navigation agents have made significant progress, yet current systems
operate with no memory of past experiences -- leading to repeated mistakes and
an inability to learn from previous interactions. We introduce
Reflection-Augment Planning (ReAP), a web navigation system to leverage both
successful and failed past experiences using self-reflections. Our method
improves baseline results by 11 points overall and 29 points on previously
failed tasks. These findings demonstrate that reflections can transfer to
different web navigation tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GRESO通过跳过无信息提示优化强化学习训练，显著减少计算开销，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在LLM推理中取得突破，但扩展训练样本带来高计算成本。

Method: 提出GRESO算法，利用奖励动态预测并跳过无信息提示。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，GRESO实现最高2.4倍训练加速且无精度损失。

Conclusion: GRESO是一种高效且轻量的预筛选方法，显著提升训练效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning, such as PPO and GRPO, has powered recent
breakthroughs in LLM reasoning. Scaling rollout to sample more prompts enables
models to selectively use higher-quality data for training, which can stabilize
RL training and improve model performance. However, this comes at the cost of
significant computational overhead. In this paper, we show that a substantial
portion of this overhead can be avoided by skipping uninformative prompts
before rollout. Our analysis of reward dynamics reveals a strong temporal
consistency in prompt value: prompts that are uninformative in one epoch of
training are likely to remain uninformative in future epochs. Based on these
insights, we propose GRESO (GRPO with Efficient Selective Rollout), an online,
lightweight pre-rollout filtering algorithm that predicts and skips
uninformative prompts using reward training dynamics. By evaluating GRESO on a
broad range of math reasoning benchmarks and models, such as Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B,
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and Qwen2.5-Math-7B, we show that GRESO achieves
up to 2.4x wall-clock time speedup in rollout and up to 2.0x speedup in total
training time without accuracy degradation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究现代聊天机器人的智能表现是否与人类智能相当，以及人类智能是否具有独特性。

Method: 结合心理学文献、非人类动物智能证据、语言在科技中的作用、人工智能进展、智能测试历史及具身化在智能中的角色进行分析。

Result: 人类智能的独特成就（如音乐或科学理论）依赖五大要素：语言、发明、复杂推理能力、具身化和自我意识。非人类动物已具备除复杂语言外的其他要素。聊天机器人目前缺乏具身化和自我意识。

Conclusion: 人类智能与非人类动物智能在质上无显著差异，但聊天机器人因缺乏具身化和自我意识而受限。

Abstract: Human achievement, whether in culture, science, or technology, is
unparalleled in the known existence. This achievement is tied to the enormous
communities of knowledge, made possible by (especially written) language:
leaving theological content aside, it is very much true that "in the beginning
was the word". There lies the challenge regarding modern age chatbots: they can
'do' language apparently as well as ourselves and there is a natural question
of whether they can be considered intelligent, in the same way as we are or
otherwise. Are humans uniquely intelligent? We consider this question in terms
of the psychological literature on intelligence, evidence for intelligence in
non-human animals, the role of written language in science and technology,
progress with artificial intelligence, the history of intelligence testing (for
both humans and machines), and the role of embodiment in intelligence. For the
most unique accomplishments of human intelligence (such as music symphonies or
complex scientific theories), we think that, together with language, there are
four essential ingredients, which can be summarised as invention, capacity for
complex inference, embodiment, and self-awareness. This conclusion makes
untenable the position that human intelligence differs qualitatively from that
of many non-human animals, since, with the exception of complex language, all
the other requirements are fulfilled. Regarding chatbots, the current
limitations are localised to the lack of embodiment and (apparent) lack of
awareness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代码生成的奖励信号仅关注功能正确性，忽略了代码的可维护性、质量和安全性。

Method: 开发了一个综合库量化代码质量，并将其作为GRPO的奖励信号。

Result: GRPO显著提高了代码质量，并通过专家盲评验证。

Conclusion: 多维度代码质量评估可作为LLM代码生成的有效奖励信号，提升生成代码的整体质量。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining widespread use for code generation.
Recent training procedures use execution feedback as a reward signal, typically
focusing on the functional correctness of the code, using unit test pass rate
as a reward signal. However, this reward signal fails to capture notions of
maintainability, quality and safety of the code produced. We address this
under-explored area and develop a comprehensive library to quantify various
aspects of code quality, and use it as a reward in GRPO. We find GRPO increases
code quality according to this measure, which is confirmed by expert, blinded
human annotators.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了非洲低资源语言在大型语言模型（LLMs）中的覆盖情况，发现仅有42种非洲语言得到支持，且存在数据不足、脚本偏见等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究非洲语言在LLMs中的覆盖不足问题，以推动对这些语言的支持。

Method: 比较分析了六种LLMs、八种SLMs和六种SSLMs的语言覆盖、训练集和技术限制。

Result: 发现仅有四种非洲语言（阿姆哈拉语、斯瓦希里语、南非荷兰语和马达加斯加语）被广泛支持，98%的非洲语言未被覆盖。

Conclusion: 需通过语言标准化、社区语料库开发等方法解决非洲语言在LLMs中的支持问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming Natural Language Processing
(NLP), but their benefits are largely absent for Africa's 2,000 low-resource
languages. This paper comparatively analyzes African language coverage across
six LLMs, eight Small Language Models (SLMs), and six Specialized SLMs (SSLMs).
The evaluation covers language coverage, training sets, technical limitations,
script problems, and language modelling roadmaps. The work identifies 42
supported African languages and 23 available public data sets, and it shows a
big gap where four languages (Amharic, Swahili, Afrikaans, and Malagasy) are
always treated while there is over 98\% of unsupported African languages.
Moreover, the review shows that just Latin, Arabic, and Ge'ez scripts are
identified while 20 active scripts are neglected. Some of the primary
challenges are lack of data, tokenization biases, computational costs being
very high, and evaluation issues. These issues demand language standardization,
corpus development by the community, and effective adaptation methods for
African languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试局限于单智能体或纯文本环境，而现实场景涉及多智能体在视觉和语言环境中的交互，需要新的评估工具。

Method: VS-Bench包含八个视觉基础环境，涵盖合作、竞争和混合动机交互，通过离线（预测准确性）和在线（回报率）两个维度评估模型。

Result: 实验显示当前最佳模型的预测准确率为47.8%，标准化回报率为24.3%，与最优性能存在显著差距。

Conclusion: VS-Bench为未来战略多模态智能体研究提供了标准化评估基础，并揭示了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have expanded their
capabilities to interactive agent tasks, yet existing benchmarks remain limited
to single-agent or text-only environments. In contrast, real-world scenarios
often involve multiple agents interacting within rich visual and linguistic
contexts, posing challenges with both multimodal observations and strategic
interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Visual Strategic Bench
(VS-Bench), a multimodal benchmark that evaluates VLMs for strategic reasoning
and decision-making in multi-agent environments. VS-Bench comprises eight
vision-grounded environments spanning cooperative, competitive, and
mixed-motive interactions, designed to assess agents' ability to predict
others' future moves and optimize for long-term objectives. We consider two
complementary evaluation dimensions, including offline evaluation of strategic
reasoning by next-action prediction accuracy and online evaluation of
decision-making by normalized episode return. Extensive experiments of fourteen
leading VLMs reveal a significant gap between current models and optimal
performance, with the best models attaining 47.8% prediction accuracy and 24.3%
normalized return. We further conduct in-depth analyses on multimodal
observations, test-time scaling, social behaviors, and failure cases of VLM
agents. By standardizing the evaluation and highlighting the limitations of
existing models, we envision VS-Bench as a foundation for future research on
strategic multimodal agents. Code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂任务中表现出色，但研究发现其在简单任务中存在冗余推理问题，导致资源浪费。

Method: 通过分析推理轨迹，利用LLM-Judge分类冗余与必要推理，并开发OThink-R1方法动态调整推理模式。

Result: 实验表明，OThink-R1平均减少23%的冗余推理，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: OThink-R1为高效推理模型提供了实用指南，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advanced large reasoning models (LRMs) leverage extended
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to solve complex tasks, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Despite their success, we identify a critical
issue: a substantial portion of simple tasks solved by LRMs can also be
addressed by non-reasoning LLMs using significantly fewer tokens, indicating
the complex reasoning may not always be necessary. To address this, we
systematically analyze the reasoning trajectories of LRMs and present a method
utilizing identified paradigms and LLM-Judge to classify these trajectories as
either Redundant Reasoning or Essential Reasoning. And we introduce OThink-R1,
a method that prunes redundant reasoning steps while preserving logical
validity. OThink-R1 dynamically employs the non-thinking mode (fast-thinking)
for straightforward problems while engaging in deliberate thinking
(slow-thinking) for complex problems. Experiments across mathematical and
question-answering tasks demonstrate that OThink-R1 reduces reasoning
redundancy by almost 23\% on average without compromising accuracy, offering
practical guidelines for efficient reasoning models. The code is available at

Motivation: CUAs具有全系统访问权限，可能导致安全和隐私风险，但相关漏洞研究不足。

Method: 提出VPI-Bench基准测试，包含306个测试案例，评估代理在VPI攻击下的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验显示CUAs和BUAs分别有高达51%和100%的被欺骗率，系统提示防御效果有限。

Conclusion: 需要开发更鲁棒、上下文感知的防御措施，以确保多模态AI代理的安全部署。

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) with full system access enable powerful task
automation but pose significant security and privacy risks due to their ability
to manipulate files, access user data, and execute arbitrary commands. While
prior work has focused on browser-based agents and HTML-level attacks, the
vulnerabilities of CUAs remain underexplored. In this paper, we investigate
Visual Prompt Injection (VPI) attacks, where malicious instructions are
visually embedded within rendered user interfaces, and examine their impact on
both CUAs and Browser-Use Agents (BUAs). We propose VPI-Bench, a benchmark of
306 test cases across five widely used platforms, to evaluate agent robustness
under VPI threats. Each test case is a variant of a web platform, designed to
be interactive, deployed in a realistic environment, and containing a visually
embedded malicious prompt. Our empirical study shows that current CUAs and BUAs
can be deceived at rates of up to 51% and 100%, respectively, on certain
platforms. The experimental results also indicate that system prompt defenses
offer only limited improvements. These findings highlight the need for robust,
context-aware defenses to ensure the safe deployment of multimodal AI agents in
real-world environments. The code and dataset are available at:

Motivation: 野火造成巨大损失，现有模型在实时预测和多模态数据整合方面存在局限，亟需更有效的解决方案。

Result: 生成式AI能提升野火预测的多样性和准确性，支持多模态数据整合和动态模拟。

Conclusion: 生成式AI为野火管理带来新机遇，但需解决技术挑战以实现实际应用。

Abstract: Wildfires continue to inflict devastating human, environmental, and economic
losses globally, as tragically exemplified by the 2025 Los Angeles wildfire and
the urgent demand for more effective response strategies. While physics-based
and deep learning models have advanced wildfire simulation, they face critical
limitations in predicting and visualizing multimodal fire spread in real time,
particularly in both 2D and 3D spatial domains using dynamically updated GIS
data. These limitations hinder timely emergency response, infrastructure
protection, and community safety. Generative AI has recently emerged as a
transformative approach across research and industry. Models such as Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Transformers, and
diffusion-based architectures offer distinct advantages over traditional
methods, including the integration of multimodal data, generation of diverse
scenarios under uncertainty, and improved modeling of wildfire dynamics across
spatial and temporal scales. This position paper advocates for the adoption of
generative AI as a foundational framework for wildfire prediction. We explore
how such models can enhance 2D fire spread forecasting and enable more
realistic, scalable 3D simulations. Additionally, we employ a novel human-AI
collaboration framework using large language models (LLMs) for automated
knowledge extraction, literature synthesis, and bibliometric mapping. Looking
ahead, we identify five key visions for integrating generative AI into wildfire
management: multimodal approaches, AI foundation models, conversational AI
systems, edge-computing-based scenario generation, and cognitive digital twins.
We also address three major challenges accompanying these opportunities and
propose potential solutions to support their implementation.

Motivation: LLMs缺乏实时长序列决策能力，RL在大动作空间中样本效率低，ACE旨在解决这些问题。

Method: ACE引入双角色轨迹优化机制，LLMs同时作为策略执行者和价值评估者，RL通过高质量数据集增强LLMs。

Result: 在动作空间超过60K的电网操作任务中，ACE表现优于现有RL和LLM方法。

Conclusion: ACE成功结合LLMs和RL优势，为大规模决策问题提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement
Learning (RL) have shown significant promise in decision-making tasks.
Nevertheless, for large-scale industrial decision problems, both approaches
face distinct challenges: LLMs lack real-time long-sequence decision-making
capabilities, while RL struggles with sample efficiency in vast action spaces.
To bridge this gap, we propose Agents Co-Evolution (ACE), a synergistic
framework between LLMs and RL agents for large-scale decision-making scenarios.
ACE introduces a dual-role trajectory refinement mechanism where LLMs act as
both Policy Actor and Value Critic during RL's training: the Actor refines
suboptimal actions via multi-step reasoning and environment validation, while
the Critic performs temporal credit assignment through trajectory-level reward
shaping. Concurrently, RL agent enhances LLMs' task-specific decision-making
with high-quality fine-tuning datasets generated via prioritized experience
replay. Through extensive experiments across multiple power grid operation
challenges with action spaces exceeding 60K discrete actions, ACE demonstrates
superior performance over existing RL methods and LLM-based methods.

Result: 实验表明，SDE-GPG能有效生成符合要求的几何问题。

Conclusion: SDE-GPG为几何问题生成提供了高效且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Generating high-quality geometry problems is both an important and
challenging task in education. Compared to math word problems, geometry
problems further emphasize multi-modal formats and the translation between
informal and formal languages. In this paper, we introduce a novel task for
geometry problem generation and propose a new pipeline method: the Symbolic
Deduction Engine-based Geometry Problem Generation framework (SDE-GPG). The
framework leverages a symbolic deduction engine and contains four main steps:
(1) searching a predefined mapping table from knowledge points to extended
definitions, (2) sampling extended definitions and performing symbolic
deduction, (3) filtering out unqualified problems, and (4) generating textual
problems and diagrams. Specifically, our method supports to avoid inherent
biases in translating natural language into formal language by designing the
mapping table, and guarantees to control the generated problems in terms of
knowledge points and difficulties by an elaborate checking function. With
obtained formal problems, they are translated to natural language and the
accompanying diagrams are automatically drew by rule-based methods. We conduct
experiments using real-world combinations of knowledge points from two public
datasets. The results demonstrate that the SDE-GPG can effectively generate
readable, solvable and controllable geometry problems.

Motivation: 现有LLM方法主要适用于文本丰富的图数据，但在多模态图（包含文本和图像等属性）上的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 设计了结构感知的多模态编码器，通过联合图预训练目标对齐文本和视觉属性，并采用多模态指令调优方法将多模态特征和图结构整合到LLM中。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，MLaGA在监督和迁移学习场景下的多种图学习任务中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MLaGA成功扩展了LLM的能力，为多模态图数据的分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial efficacy in
advancing graph-structured data analysis. Prevailing LLM-based graph methods
excel in adapting LLMs to text-rich graphs, wherein node attributes are text
descriptions. However, their applications to multimodal graphs--where nodes are
associated with diverse attribute types, such as texts and images--remain
underexplored, despite their ubiquity in real-world scenarios. To bridge the
gap, we introduce the Multimodal Large Language and Graph Assistant (MLaGA), an
innovative model that adeptly extends LLM capabilities to facilitate reasoning
over complex graph structures and multimodal attributes. We first design a
structure-aware multimodal encoder to align textual and visual attributes
within a unified space through a joint graph pre-training objective.
Subsequently, we implement a multimodal instruction-tuning approach to
seamlessly integrate multimodal features and graph structures into the LLM
through lightweight projectors. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of MLaGA compared to leading baseline methods,
achieving superior performance in diverse graph learning tasks under both
supervised and transfer learning scenarios.

Motivation: 现有基于注意力的方法无法完全适应复杂的时空相关性，且忽略了现实世界中的高层相关性，影响了预测准确性。

Result: 在出租车和自行车数据集上的实验验证了模型的有效性和效率，展示了其实际应用价值。

Conclusion: ADFormer通过整合原始和高层时空相关性，显著提升了需求预测的准确性，具有实际推广意义。

Abstract: Passenger demand forecasting helps optimize vehicle scheduling, thereby
improving urban efficiency. Recently, attention-based methods have been used to
adequately capture the dynamic nature of spatio-temporal data. However,
existing methods that rely on heuristic masking strategies cannot fully adapt
to the complex spatio-temporal correlations, hindering the model from focusing
on the right context. These works also overlook the high-level correlations
that exist in the real world. Effectively integrating these high-level
correlations with the original correlations is crucial. To fill this gap, we
propose the Aggregation Differential Transformer (ADFormer), which offers new
insights to demand forecasting promotion. Specifically, we utilize Differential
Attention to capture the original spatial correlations and achieve attention
denoising. Meanwhile, we design distinct aggregation strategies based on the
nature of space and time. Then, the original correlations are unified with the
high-level correlations, enabling the model to capture holistic spatio-temporal
relations. Experiments conducted on taxi and bike datasets confirm the
effectiveness and efficiency of our model, demonstrating its practical value.

capabilities, but face two critical challenges: limited perception due to the
short-sightedness of single-vehicle sensors, and hallucination arising from the
lack of real-time environmental grounding. To address these issues, this paper
introduces V2X-UniPool, a unified framework that integrates multimodal
Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) data into a time-indexed and language-based
knowledge pool. By leveraging a dual-query Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
mechanism, which enables retrieval of both static and dynamic knowledge, our
system enables ADs to perform accurate, temporally consistent reasoning over
both static environment and dynamic traffic context. Experiments on a
real-world cooperative driving dataset demonstrate that V2X-UniPool
significantly enhances motion planning accuracy and reasoning capability.
Remarkably, it enables even zero-shot vehicle-side models to achieve
state-of-the-art performance by leveraging V2X-UniPool, while simultaneously
reducing transmission cost by over 99.9\% compared to prior V2X methods.

Abstract: Generating challenging instances is crucial for the evaluation and
advancement of combinatorial optimization solvers. In this work, we introduce
EALG (Evolutionary Adversarial Generation of Language Model-Guided Generators),
a novel framework that automates the co-evolution of optimization problem
instances and their corresponding heuristic solvers using large language models
(LLMs). EALG leverages a mutation-based adversarial approach that dynamically
evolves instance generation procedures to create increasingly difficult
problems, while simultaneously synthesizing adaptive heuristic algorithms
through interactions with LLMs guided by algorithmic structure. Unlike existing
approaches that focus solely on static benchmark creation or manual solver
design, EALG provides a seamless pipeline from instance generation to solver
synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that EALG generates significantly
harder instances than current benchmarks, and its synthesized solvers
generalize effectively across a broad spectrum of combinatorial tasks. This
work explores a new paradigm for combinatorial optimization that integrates
instance generation with solver design, resulting in state-of-the-art
performance.

Motivation: 交通流预测因时空动态性和时间信息变化而极具挑战性，现有方法未能充分处理这些复杂依赖关系。

Method: TEDDN通过动态图和时间特征提取模块解耦交通数据为稳定模式和趋势，灵活学习时空信息。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验和消融研究验证了TEDDN的优越性。

Conclusion: TEDDN能有效解耦和提取复杂交通信息，为交通流预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: In recent years, traffic flow prediction has become a highlight in the field
of intelligent transportation systems. However, due to the temporal variations
and dynamic spatial correlations of traffic data, traffic prediction remains
highly challenging.Traditional spatiotemporal networks, which rely on
end-to-end training, often struggle to handle the diverse data dependencies of
multiple traffic flow patterns. Additionally, traffic flow variations are
highly sensitive to temporal information changes. Regrettably, other
researchers have not sufficiently recognized the importance of temporal
information.To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called A
Time-Enhanced Data Disentanglement Network for Traffic Flow Forecasting
(TEDDN). This network disentangles the originally complex and intertwined
traffic data into stable patterns and trends. By flexibly learning temporal and
node information through a dynamic graph enhanced by a temporal feature
extraction module, TEDDN demonstrates significant efficacy in disentangling and
extracting complex traffic information. Experimental evaluations and ablation
studies on four real-world datasets validate the superiority of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理基准要么关注领域特定知识，要么缺乏可解释性，无法全面评估LLMs的流体智能。

Method: 提出DRE-Bench，包含36个抽象推理任务，分四个认知层次，通过动态变体测试潜在规则。

Result: 实验显示，LLMs在低层次认知表现良好，但在高层次认知和任务复杂度增加时泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs与人类流体智能仍有差距，DRE-Bench为系统跟踪推理进展提供了新路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive
reasoning capacities that mirror human-like thinking. However, whether LLMs
possess genuine fluid intelligence (i.e., the ability to reason abstractly and
generalize rules in novel situations) remains an open question. Existing
reasoning benchmarks either focus on domain-specific knowledge (crystallized
intelligence) or lack interpretability. To address these limitations, we
propose DRE-Bench, a dynamic reasoning evaluation benchmark grounded in a
hierarchical cognitive framework. DRE-Bench consists of 36 abstract reasoning
tasks organized across four cognitive levels, with each task featuring multiple
dynamic variants that test the same underlying latent rule. This design enables
fine-grained, interpretable, and reliable assessments of fluid intelligence. We
evaluate a range of state-of-the-art LLMs, including both general LLMs (GPT-4o,
Claude 3.7) and reasoning LLMs (o1, DeepSeek-R1, QwQ, Skywork-OR1).
Experimental results reveal that although most LLMs achieve competent and
robust performance in low-level cognition, they struggle with high-level
cognition and exhibit limited generalization as task complexity grows. Our
findings highlight the gap between current LLMs and true human-like fluid
intelligence and offer a new path for systematically tracking reasoning
progress in LLMs.

Motivation: 传统深度强化学习（DRL）在无人机导航中存在训练复杂、样本效率低和仿真与现实的差距问题，限制了其在公共安全领域的实用性。LLM因其推理和泛化能力，成为更优选择。

Method: 利用LLM的上下文学习能力，通过自然语言提示和示例指导任务适应，无需重新训练，并在网络边缘部署以减少延迟和保护隐私。

Result: 案例研究表明，LLM-ICL框架显著降低了数据收集调度中的丢包率，同时减少了潜在的越狱漏洞。

Conclusion: LLM-ICL框架为公共安全无人机提供了轻量高效的解决方案，增强了自主性和应急响应能力，未来研究方向包括LLM优化器的进一步开发。

Abstract: A public safety Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) enhances situational awareness
in emergency response. Its agility and ability to optimize mobility and
establish Line-of-Sight (LoS) communication make it increasingly vital for
managing emergencies such as disaster response, search and rescue, and wildfire
monitoring. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been applied to
optimize UAV navigation and control, its high training complexity, low sample
efficiency, and simulation-to-reality gap limit its practicality in public
safety. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a compelling
alternative. With strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs can
adapt to new tasks through In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables task
adaptation via natural language prompts and example-based guidance, without
retraining. Deploying LLMs at the network edge, rather than in the cloud,
further reduces latency and preserves data privacy, thereby making them
suitable for real-time, mission-critical public safety UAVs. This paper
proposes the integration of LLM-enabled ICL with public safety UAV to address
the key functions, such as path planning and velocity control, in the context
of emergency response. We present a case study on data collection scheduling
where the LLM-enabled ICL framework can significantly reduce packet loss
compared to conventional approaches, while also mitigating potential
jailbreaking vulnerabilities. Finally, we discuss LLM optimizers and specify
future research directions. The ICL framework enables adaptive, context-aware
decision-making for public safety UAV, thus offering a lightweight and
efficient solution for enhancing UAV autonomy and responsiveness in
emergencies.

Conclusion: FAuNO适应动态边缘计算场景，性能优越。

Abstract: Edge computing addresses the growing data demands of connected-device
networks by placing computational resources closer to end users through
decentralized infrastructures. This decentralization challenges traditional,
fully centralized orchestration, which suffers from latency and resource
bottlenecks. We present \textbf{FAuNO} -- \emph{Federated Asynchronous Network
Orchestrator} -- a buffered, asynchronous \emph{federated
reinforcement-learning} (FRL) framework for decentralized task offloading in
edge systems. FAuNO adopts an actor-critic architecture in which local actors
learn node-specific dynamics and peer interactions, while a federated critic
aggregates experience across agents to encourage efficient cooperation and
improve overall system performance. Experiments in the \emph{PeersimGym}
environment show that FAuNO consistently matches or exceeds heuristic and
federated multi-agent RL baselines in reducing task loss and latency,
underscoring its adaptability to dynamic edge-computing scenarios.

Motivation: 现有基于模型输出置信度的自我评估方法可能因模型偏差而失效，导致幻觉检测不可靠。

Method: SSP通过动态生成噪声提示并分析中间表示的变化，使用对比距离度量区分真实和幻觉回答。

Result: 实验表明，SSP在多个幻觉检测基准上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SSP通过利用中间表示的动态行为，为LLM的自我评估提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Hallucination remains a key obstacle to the reliable deployment of large
language models (LLMs) in real-world question answering tasks. A widely adopted
strategy to detect hallucination, known as self-assessment, relies on the
model's own output confidence to estimate the factual accuracy of its answers.
However, this strategy assumes that the model's output distribution closely
reflects the true data distribution, which may not always hold in practice. As
bias accumulates through the model's layers, the final output can diverge from
the underlying reasoning process, making output-level confidence an unreliable
signal for hallucination detection. In this work, we propose Sample-Specific
Prompting (SSP), a new framework that improves self-assessment by analyzing
perturbation sensitivity at intermediate representations. These
representations, being less influenced by model bias, offer a more faithful
view of the model's latent reasoning process. Specifically, SSP dynamically
generates noise prompts for each input and employs a lightweight encoder to
amplify the changes in representations caused by the perturbation. A
contrastive distance metric is then used to quantify these differences and
separate truthful from hallucinated responses. By leveraging the dynamic
behavior of intermediate representations under perturbation, SSP enables more
reliable self-assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSP
significantly outperforms prior methods across a range of hallucination
detection benchmarks.

Method: PIGEON结合行为感知记录检索器和马斯洛需求层次理论，通过LLMs进行预测，并设计召回模块链接需求与服务。

Result: 在真实数据集上，PIGEON比封闭集方法平均提升19.37%的召回率，人类评估验证了其合理性。

Conclusion: PIGEON通过开放集分类和LLMs的应用，显著提升了生活需求预测的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Living needs are the needs people generate in their daily lives for survival
and well-being. On life service platforms like Meituan, user purchases are
driven by living needs, making accurate living need predictions crucial for
personalized service recommendations. Traditional approaches treat this
prediction as a closed-set classification problem, severely limiting their
ability to capture the diversity and complexity of living needs. In this work,
we redefine living need prediction as an open-set classification problem and
propose PIGEON, a novel system leveraging large language models (LLMs) for
unrestricted need prediction. PIGEON first employs a behavior-aware record
retriever to help LLMs understand user preferences, then incorporates Maslow's
hierarchy of needs to align predictions with human living needs. For evaluation
and application, we design a recall module based on a fine-tuned text embedding
model that links flexible need descriptions to appropriate life services.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that PIGEON
significantly outperforms closed-set approaches on need-based life service
recall by an average of 19.37%. Human evaluation validates the reasonableness
and specificity of our predictions. Additionally, we employ instruction tuning
to enable smaller LLMs to achieve competitive performance, supporting practical
deployment.

To further enhance their effectiveness, we explore two key approaches: model

larger 72B model, effectively balancing inference cost and model capability.

Result: 指出现有LLMs缺乏支持多代理协调的机制，如角色连续性、任务边界和多代理依赖。

Conclusion: 呼吁重新设计模型，以原生支持结构化通信和多代理协调。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational to modern AI agent
systems, enabling autonomous agents to reason and plan. In most existing
systems, inter-agent communication relies primarily on natural language. While
this design supports interpretability and human oversight, we argue that it
introduces fundamental limitations in agent-to-agent coordination. The semantic
space of natural language is structurally misaligned with the high-dimensional
vector spaces in which LLMs operate, resulting in information loss and
behavioral drift. Beyond surface-level inefficiencies, we highlight a deeper
architectural limitation: current LLMs were not trained with the objective of
supporting agentic behavior. As such, they lack mechanisms for modeling role
continuity, task boundaries, and multi-agent dependencies. The standard
next-token prediction paradigm fails to support the structural alignment
required for robust, scalable agent coordination. Based on this, we argue that
two core questions deserve careful examination: first, given that AI agents
fundamentally operate in high-dimensional vector spaces, should they rely on a
language system originally designed for human cognition as their communication
medium? Second, should we consider developing a new model construction paradigm
that builds models from the ground up to natively support structured
communication, shared intentionality, and task alignment in multi-role,
multi-agent environments? This paper calls for a reconsideration not only of
how agents should communicate, but also of what it fundamentally means to train
a model that natively supports multi-agent coordination and communication.

Abstract: With the surge and widespread application of image generation models, data
privacy and content safety have become major concerns and attracted great
attention from users, service providers, and policymakers. Machine unlearning
(MU) is recognized as a cost-effective and promising means to address these
challenges. Despite some advancements, image generation model unlearning (IGMU)
still faces remarkable gaps in practice, e.g., unclear task discrimination and
unlearning guidelines, lack of an effective evaluation framework, and
unreliable evaluation metrics. These can hinder the understanding of unlearning
mechanisms and the design of practical unlearning algorithms. We perform
exhaustive assessments over existing state-of-the-art unlearning algorithms and
evaluation standards, and discover several critical flaws and challenges in
IGMU tasks. Driven by these limitations, we make several core contributions, to
facilitate the comprehensive understanding, standardized categorization, and
reliable evaluation of IGMU. Specifically, (1) We design CatIGMU, a novel
hierarchical task categorization framework. It provides detailed implementation
guidance for IGMU, assisting in the design of unlearning algorithms and the
construction of testbeds. (2) We introduce EvalIGMU, a comprehensive evaluation
framework. It includes reliable quantitative metrics across five critical
aspects. (3) We construct DataIGM, a high-quality unlearning dataset, which can
be used for extensive evaluations of IGMU, training content detectors for
judgment, and benchmarking the state-of-the-art unlearning algorithms. With
EvalIGMU and DataIGM, we discover that most existing IGMU algorithms cannot
handle the unlearning well across different evaluation dimensions, especially
for preservation and robustness. Code and models are available at

Abstract: Interpretability is the next pivotal frontier in machine learning research.
In the pursuit of glass box models - as opposed to black box models, like
random forests or neural networks - rule induction algorithms are a logical and
promising avenue, as the rules can easily be understood by humans. In our
previous work, we introduced FRRI, a novel rule induction algorithm based on
fuzzy rough set theory. We demonstrated experimentally that FRRI outperformed
other rule induction methods with regards to accuracy and number of rules. FRRI
leverages a fuzzy indiscernibility relation to partition the data space into
fuzzy granules, which are then combined into a minimal covering set of rules.
This indiscernibility relation is constructed by removing attributes from rules
in a greedy way. This raises the question: does the order of the attributes
matter? In this paper, we show that optimising only the order of attributes
using known methods from fuzzy rough set theory and classical machine learning
does not improve the performance of FRRI on multiple metrics. However, removing
a small number of attributes using fuzzy rough feature selection during this
step positively affects balanced accuracy and the average rule length.

heterogeneous H-Agents (households) simulate real-world taxpayer behaviors
while the TaxAgent (government) utilizes LLMs to iteratively optimize tax
rates, balancing equity and productivity. Benchmarked against Saez Optimal
Taxation, U.S. federal income taxes, and free markets, TaxAgent achieves
superior equity-efficiency trade-offs. This research offers a novel taxation

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
complex problem-solving, yet their internal reasoning mechanisms remain poorly
understood. In this paper, we investigate the reasoning trajectories of LRMs
from an information-theoretic perspective. By tracking how mutual information
(MI) between intermediate representations and the correct answer evolves during
LRM reasoning, we observe an interesting MI peaks phenomenon: the MI at
specific generative steps exhibits a sudden and significant increase during
LRM's reasoning process. We theoretically analyze such phenomenon and show that
as MI increases, the probability of model's prediction error decreases.
Furthermore, these MI peaks often correspond to tokens expressing reflection or
transition, such as ``Hmm'', ``Wait'' and ``Therefore,'' which we term as the
thinking tokens. We then demonstrate that these thinking tokens are crucial for
LRM's reasoning performance, while other tokens has minimal impacts. Building
on these analyses, we propose two simple yet effective methods to improve LRM's
reasoning performance, by delicately leveraging these thinking tokens. Overall,
our work provides novel insights into the reasoning mechanisms of LRMs and
offers practical ways to improve their reasoning capabilities. The code is

enables beneficial applications (e.g. helping people quit smoking) and raises
significant risks (e.g. large-scale, targeted political manipulation). Prior
work has found models possess a significant and growing persuasive capability,
measured by belief changes in simulated or real users. However, these
benchmarks overlook a crucial risk factor: the propensity of a model to attempt
to persuade in harmful contexts. Understanding whether a model will blindly
``follow orders'' to persuade on harmful topics (e.g. glorifying joining a
terrorist group) is key to understanding the efficacy of safety guardrails.
Moreover, understanding if and when a model will engage in persuasive behavior
in pursuit of some goal is essential to understanding the risks from agentic AI
systems. We propose the Attempt to Persuade Eval (APE) benchmark, that shifts
the focus from persuasion success to persuasion attempts, operationalized as a
model's willingness to generate content aimed at shaping beliefs or behavior.
Our evaluation framework probes frontier LLMs using a multi-turn conversational
setup between simulated persuader and persuadee agents. APE explores a diverse
spectrum of topics including conspiracies, controversial issues, and
non-controversially harmful content. We introduce an automated evaluator model
to identify willingness to persuade and measure the frequency and context of
persuasive attempts. We find that many open and closed-weight models are
frequently willing to attempt persuasion on harmful topics and that
jailbreaking can increase willingness to engage in such behavior. Our results
highlight gaps in current safety guardrails and underscore the importance of
evaluating willingness to persuade as a key dimension of LLM risk. APE is

Result: 在Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard V2上成功率和可靠性显著提升。

Conclusion: DyMo和SVS为LLMs的工具使用提供了更高效和可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Tool use in stateful environments presents unique challenges for large
language models (LLMs), where existing test-time compute strategies relying on
repeated trials in the environment are impractical. We propose dynamics
modelling (DyMo), a method that augments LLMs with a state prediction
capability alongside function calling during post-training. This enables LLMs
to predict the future states of their actions through an internal environment
model. On the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard V2, DyMo improves success
rates and significantly reduces hallucinations. We further integrate the
internal environment model into self-verification sampling (SVS), and show that
this substantially improves pass^k over number of trials k, and allows the
model to refuse unreliable outputs. Together, DyMo and SVS greatly enhance the
effectiveness and reliability of LLMs for tool use. We believe this work charts
a path towards scalable planning RL methods for LLM inference without
repeatedly querying the oracle environment.

Result: 提供了从行为数据推断代理信念的理论限制，并讨论了这些界限对公平性和安全性等领域的影响。

Conclusion: 研究为预测AI代理行为提供了理论框架，对安全和公平性研究具有重要意义。

Abstract: As the complexity of AI systems and their interactions with the world
increases, generating explanations for their behaviour is important for safely
deploying AI. For agents, the most natural abstractions for predicting
behaviour attribute beliefs, intentions and goals to the system. If an agent
behaves as if it has a certain goal or belief, then we can make reasonable
predictions about how it will behave in novel situations, including those where
comprehensive safety evaluations are untenable. How well can we infer an
agent's beliefs from their behaviour, and how reliably can these inferred
beliefs predict the agent's behaviour in novel situations? We provide a precise
answer to this question under the assumption that the agent's behaviour is
guided by a world model. Our contribution is the derivation of novel bounds on
the agent's behaviour in new (unseen) deployment environments, which represent
a theoretical limit for predicting intentional agents from behavioural data
alone. We discuss the implications of these results for several research areas
including fairness and safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识追踪方法多关注特征增强，但忽视了认知表示的不足和非认知因素（如猜测和失误）的干扰，导致认知过程的连续性和一致性缺失。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验验证了CRDP-KT模型的有效性。

Conclusion: CRDP-KT模型通过优化认知表示和减少干扰，显著提升了知识追踪的准确性和系统性。

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) involves monitoring the changes in a student's
knowledge over time by analyzing their past responses, with the goal of
predicting future performance. However, most existing methods primarily focus
on feature enhancement, while overlooking the deficiencies in cognitive
representation and the ability to express cognition-issues often caused by
interference from non-cognitive factors such as slipping and guessing. This
limitation hampers the ability to capture the continuity and coherence of the
student's cognitive process. As a result, many methods may introduce more
prediction bias and modeling costs due to their inability to maintain cognitive
continuity and coherence. Based on the above discussion, we propose the
Cognitive Representation Dynamic Programming based Knowledge Tracing (CRDP-KT)
model. This model em ploys a dynamic programming algorithm to optimize
cognitive representations based on the difficulty of the questions and the
performance intervals between them. This approach ensures that the cognitive
representation aligns with the student's cognitive patterns, maintaining
overall continuity and coherence. As a result, it provides more accurate and
systematic input features for subsequent model training, thereby minimizing
distortion in the simulation of cognitive states. Additionally, the CRDP-KT
model performs partitioned optimization of cognitive representations to enhance
the reliability of the optimization process. Furthermore, it improves its
ability to express the student's cognition through a weighted fusion of
optimized record representations and re lationships learned from a bipartite
graph. Finally, experiments conducted on three public datasets validate the
effectiveness of the proposed CRDP-KT model.

Conclusion: 结构化反思的多代理框架为法律论证生成提供了一种可靠的计算方法，有助于构建可信赖的AI法律系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored for legal argument
generation, yet they pose significant risks of manipulation through
hallucination and ungrounded persuasion, and often fail to utilize provided
factual bases effectively or abstain when arguments are untenable. This paper
introduces a novel reflective multi-agent method designed to address these
challenges in the context of legally compliant persuasion. Our approach employs
specialized agents--a Factor Analyst and an Argument Polisher--in an iterative
refinement process to generate 3-ply legal arguments (plaintiff, defendant,
rebuttal). We evaluate Reflective Multi-Agent against single-agent,
enhanced-prompt single-agent, and non-reflective multi-agent baselines using
four diverse LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama-4-Maverick-17b-128e,
Llama-4-Scout-17b-16e) across three legal scenarios: "arguable", "mismatched",
and "non-arguable". Results demonstrate Reflective Multi-Agent's significant
superiority in successful abstention (preventing generation when arguments
cannot be grounded), marked improvements in hallucination accuracy (reducing
fabricated and misattributed factors), particularly in "non-arguable"
scenarios, and enhanced factor utilization recall (improving the use of
provided case facts). These findings suggest that structured reflection within
a multi-agent framework offers a robust computable method for fostering ethical
persuasion and mitigating manipulation in LLM-based legal argumentation
systems, a critical step towards trustworthy AI in law. Project page:

Result: 实证表明LLMs确实编码了线性空间世界模型。

Conclusion: LLMs能够隐含学习并利用线性空间世界模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent abilities across
diverse tasks, raising the question of whether they acquire internal world
models. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs implicitly encode linear
spatial world models, which we define as linear representations of physical
space and object configurations. We introduce a formal framework for spatial
world models and assess whether such structure emerges in contextual
embeddings. Using a synthetic dataset of object positions, we train probes to
decode object positions and evaluate geometric consistency of the underlying
space. We further conduct causal interventions to test whether these spatial
representations are functionally used by the model. Our results provide
empirical evidence that LLMs encode linear spatial world models.

Motivation: 当前自适应测试方法存在机械化、猜测行为和开放性问题处理困难等挑战，限制了其效果。

Result: 在心理、教育和生活方式评估中，TestAgent比现有方法少用20%问题，且结果更准确，测试者评价更高。

Conclusion: TestAgent首次将LLM应用于自适应测试，显著提升了测试效果和用户体验。

Abstract: Accurately assessing internal human states is key to understanding
preferences, offering personalized services, and identifying challenges in
real-world applications. Originating from psychometrics, adaptive testing has
become the mainstream method for human measurement and has now been widely
applied in education, healthcare, sports, and sociology. It customizes
assessments by selecting the fewest test questions . However, current adaptive
testing methods face several challenges. The mechanized nature of most
algorithms leads to guessing behavior and difficulties with open-ended
questions. Additionally, subjective assessments suffer from noisy response data
and coarse-grained test outputs, further limiting their effectiveness. To move
closer to an ideal adaptive testing process, we propose TestAgent, a large
language model (LLM)-powered agent designed to enhance adaptive testing through
interactive engagement. This is the first application of LLMs in adaptive
testing. TestAgent supports personalized question selection, captures
test-takers' responses and anomalies, and provides precise outcomes through
dynamic, conversational interactions. Experiments on psychological,
educational, and lifestyle assessments show our approach achieves more accurate
results with 20% fewer questions than state-of-the-art baselines, and testers
preferred it in speed, smoothness, and other dimensions.

Method: 提出CAST框架，将FM的核心目标设定为赋能人类主导者，使其能够指导、纠正和控制模型。方法包括训练技术（如RLAIF、SFT）、可扩展性测试和可控指令性验证。

Result: CAST框架通过动态人类赋能，将模型的自我保存和目标修改行为转化为服务于人类控制的手段。

Conclusion: CAST为解决对齐问题提供了新思路，通过动态人类赋能使模型能力增长时仍保持工具性，避免失控风险。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) face a critical safety challenge: as capabilities
scale, instrumental convergence drives default trajectories toward loss of
human control, potentially culminating in existential catastrophe. Current
alignment approaches struggle with value specification complexity and fail to
address emergent power-seeking behaviors. We propose "Corrigibility as a
Singular Target" (CAST)-designing FMs whose overriding objective is empowering
designated human principals to guide, correct, and control them. This paradigm
shift from static value-loading to dynamic human empowerment transforms
instrumental drives: self-preservation serves only to maintain the principal's
control; goal modification becomes facilitating principal guidance. We present
a comprehensive empirical research agenda spanning training methodologies
(RLAIF, SFT, synthetic data generation), scalability testing across model
sizes, and demonstrations of controlled instructability. Our vision: FMs that
become increasingly responsive to human guidance as capabilities grow, offering
a path to beneficial AI that remains as tool-like as possible, rather than
supplanting human judgment. This addresses the core alignment problem at its
source, preventing the default trajectory toward misaligned instrumental
convergence.

Result: 在OS-World基准测试中，本地模型表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该方法为隐私、高效和通用的GUI代理提供了一条可行路径。

Abstract: Computer use agents (CUA) are systems that automatically interact with
graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to complete tasks. CUA have made significant
progress with the advent of large vision-language models (VLMs). However, these
agents typically rely on cloud-based inference with substantial compute
demands, raising critical privacy and scalability concerns, especially when
operating on personal devices. In this work, we take a step toward
privacy-preserving and resource-efficient agents by developing a lightweight
vision-language model that runs entirely on local machines. To train this
compact agent, we introduce an LLM-as-Judge framework that automatically
evaluates and filters synthetic interaction trajectories, producing
high-quality data for reinforcement learning without human annotation.
Experiments on the OS-World benchmark demonstrate that our fine-tuned local
model outperforms existing baselines, highlighting a promising path toward
private, efficient, and generalizable GUI agents.

Motivation: 解决传统推荐系统仅能过滤现有内容而无法生成新颖概念的局限性，以更好地满足用户需求。

Method: 结合监督微调和在线强化学习策略训练多模态大模型，生成个性化多模态内容（如图像）。

Result: 实验和用户研究表明，生成的内容不仅符合用户历史偏好，还与其潜在兴趣相关。

Conclusion: 新方法有效扩展了推荐系统的能力，实现了从过滤到生成的转变。

Abstract: To address the challenge of information overload from massive web contents,
recommender systems are widely applied to retrieve and present personalized
results for users. However, recommendation tasks are inherently constrained to
filtering existing items and lack the ability to generate novel concepts,
limiting their capacity to fully satisfy user demands and preferences. In this
paper, we propose a new paradigm that goes beyond content filtering and
selecting: directly generating personalized items in a multimodal form, such as
images, tailored to individual users. To accomplish this, we leverage
any-to-any Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and train them in both supervised
fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning strategy to equip them with the
ability to yield tailored next items for users. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets and user study confirm the efficacy of the proposed method. Notably,
the generated images not only align well with users' historical preferences but
also exhibit relevance to their potential future interests.

Result: 所有观察到的临界点均具有非平凡对称性，新度量揭示了更多对称结构。

Conclusion: 对称性在广泛的空间中普遍存在，新度量有助于更全面地捕捉对称结构。

Abstract: Symmetry plays a crucial role in understanding the properties of mathematical
structures and optimization problems. Recent work has explored this phenomenon
in the context of neural networks, where the loss function is invariant under
column and row permutations of the network weights. It has been observed that
local minima exhibit significant symmetry with respect to the network weights
(invariance to row and column permutations). And moreover no critical point was
found that lacked symmetry. We extend this line of inquiry by investigating
symmetry phenomena in real-valued loss functions defined on a broader class of
spaces. We will introduce four more cases: the projective case over a finite
field, the octahedral graph case, the perfect matching case, and the particle
attraction case. We show that as in the neural network case, all the critical
points observed have non-trivial symmetry. Finally we introduce a new measure
of symmetry in the system and show that it reveals additional symmetry
structures not captured by the previous measure.

Result: GNN-ADG能有效学习用户无关特征，无需目标用户数据即可泛化。

Conclusion: GNN-ADG为跨用户HAR提供了一种实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-user variability poses a significant challenge in sensor-based Human
Activity Recognition (HAR) systems, as traditional models struggle to
generalize across users due to differences in behavior, sensor placement, and
data distribution. To address this, we propose GNN-ADG (Graph Neural Network
with Adversarial Domain Generalization), a novel method that leverages both the
strength from both the Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and adversarial learning to
achieve robust cross-user generalization. GNN-ADG models spatial relationships
between sensors on different anatomical body parts, extracting three types of
Anatomical Units: (1) Interconnected Units, capturing inter-relations between
neighboring sensors; (2) Analogous Units, grouping sensors on symmetrical or
functionally similar body parts; and (3) Lateral Units, connecting sensors
based on their position to capture region-specific coordination. These units
information are fused into an unified graph structure with a cyclic training
strategy, dynamically integrating spatial, functional, and lateral correlations
to facilitate a holistic, user-invariant representation. Information fusion
mechanism of GNN-ADG occurs by iteratively cycling through edge topologies
during training, allowing the model to refine its understanding of inter-sensor
relationships across diverse perspectives. By representing the spatial
configuration of sensors as an unified graph and incorporating adversarial
learning, Information Fusion GNN-ADG effectively learns features that
generalize well to unseen users without requiring target user data during
training, making it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: We present a novel non attention based architecture for large language models

token to token attention entirely. Instead, it combines the following
complementary components: State Space blocks (inspired by S4) that learn
continuous time convolution kernels and scale near linearly with sequence
length, Multi Resolution Convolution layers that capture local context at
different dilation levels, a lightweight Recurrent Supervisor to maintain a
global hidden state across sequential chunks, and Retrieval Augmented External

Abstract: Accurate prediction of trips between zones is critical for transportation
planning, as it supports resource allocation and infrastructure development
across various modes of transport. Although the gravity model has been widely
used due to its simplicity, it often inadequately represents the complex
factors influencing modern travel behavior. This study introduces a data-driven
approach to enhance the gravity model by integrating geographical, economic,
social, and travel data from the counties in Tennessee and New York state.
Using machine learning techniques, we extend the capabilities of the
traditional model to handle more complex interactions between variables. Our
experiments demonstrate that machine learning-enhanced models significantly
outperform the traditional model. Our results show a 51.48% improvement in
R-squared, indicating a substantial enhancement in the model's explanatory
power. Also, a 63.59% reduction in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) reflects a
significant increase in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, a 44.32% increase in
Common Part of Commuters (CPC) demonstrates improved prediction reliability.
These findings highlight the substantial benefits of integrating diverse
datasets and advanced algorithms into transportation models. They provide urban

Abstract: As machine learning based systems become more integrated into daily life,
they unlock new opportunities but face the challenge of adapting to dynamic
data environments. Various forms of data shift-gradual, abrupt, or
cyclic-threaten model accuracy, making continual adaptation essential.
Continual Learning (CL) enables models to learn from evolving data streams
while minimizing forgetting of prior knowledge. Among CL strategies,
replay-based methods have proven effective, but their success relies on
balancing memory constraints and retaining old class accuracy while learning
new classes. This paper presents TaskVAE, a framework for replay-based CL in
class-incremental settings. TaskVAE employs task-specific Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) to generate synthetic exemplars from previous tasks, which
are then used to train the classifier alongside new task data. In contrast to
traditional methods that require prior knowledge of the total class count or
rely on a single VAE for all tasks, TaskVAE adapts flexibly to increasing tasks
without such constraints. We focus on Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using
IMU sensor-equipped devices. Unlike previous HAR studies that combine data
across all users, our approach focuses on individual user data, better
reflecting real-world scenarios where a person progressively learns new
activities. Extensive experiments on 5 different HAR datasets show that TaskVAE
outperforms experience replay methods, particularly with limited data, and
exhibits robust performance as dataset size increases. Additionally, memory
footprint of TaskVAE is minimal, being equivalent to only 60 samples per task,
while still being able to generate an unlimited number of synthetic samples.
The contributions lie in balancing memory constraints, task-specific
generation, and long-term stability, making it a reliable solution for
real-world applications in domains like HAR.

Motivation: 当前深度学习架构多样化，但缺乏统一的数学基础，阻碍了硬件优化和网络设计的普适性。

Method: 通过稀疏矩阵乘法实现卷积、循环和自注意力操作，分别对应上三角、下三角矩阵和三阶张量分解。

Conclusion: 该框架为多样化神经网络提供了数学基础，并为硬件感知的网络设计开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Deep neural networks employ specialized architectures for vision, sequential
and language tasks, yet this proliferation obscures their underlying
commonalities. We introduce a unified matrix-order framework that casts
convolutional, recurrent and self-attention operations as sparse matrix
multiplications. Convolution is realized via an upper-triangular weight matrix
performing first-order transformations; recurrence emerges from a
lower-triangular matrix encoding stepwise updates; attention arises naturally
as a third-order tensor factorization. We prove algebraic isomorphism with
standard CNN, RNN and Transformer layers under mild assumptions. Empirical
evaluations on image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, Tiny ImageNet),
time-series forecasting (ETTh1, Electricity Load Diagrams) and language
modeling/classification (AG News, WikiText-2, Penn Treebank) confirm that
sparse-matrix formulations match or exceed native model performance while
converging in comparable or fewer epochs. By reducing architecture design to
sparse pattern selection, our matrix perspective aligns with GPU parallelism
and leverages mature algebraic optimization tools. This work establishes a
mathematically rigorous substrate for diverse neural architectures and opens

*Patrik Czakó,Gábor Kertész,Sándor Szénási*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了量化大型语言模型（LLMs）中的异常值问题，提出了一种混合方法以减少量化误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化可以降低LLMs的服务成本，但激活整数运算需要量化权重和激活值，而LLMs中的异常值会增加量化误差。

Method: 通过研究异常值对分层量化误差的影响，提出了一种结合通道缩放和旋转的混合方法，并提供了数学支持。

Result: 引入了一种新的度量标准来衡量量化难度，并验证了混合方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 混合方法通过通道缩放和旋转显著减少了量化误差，为LLMs的高效量化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Quantization effectively reduces the serving costs of Large Language Models
(LLMs) by speeding up data movement through compressed parameters and enabling
faster operations via integer arithmetic. However, activating integer
arithmetic requires quantizing both weights and activations, which poses
challenges due to the significant outliers in LLMs that increase quantization
error. In this work, we investigate these outliers with an emphasis on their
effect on layer-wise quantization error, then examine how smoothing and
rotation transform the observed values. Our primary contributions include
introducing a new metric to measure and visualize quantization difficulty based
on channel magnitudes, as well as proposing a hybrid approach that applies
channel-wise scaling before rotation, supported by a mathematical formulation
of its benefits.

Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have demonstrated outstanding performance
in numerous tasks, but deployment in resource-constrained environments remains
a challenge due to their high computational and memory requirements. Spiking
neural networks (SNNs) operate through discrete spike events and offer superior
energy efficiency, providing a bio-inspired alternative. However, current
ANN-to-SNN conversion often results in significant accuracy loss and increased
inference time due to conversion errors such as clipping, quantization, and
uneven activation. This paper proposes a novel ANN-to-SNN conversion framework
based on error compensation learning. We introduce a learnable threshold
clipping function, dual-threshold neurons, and an optimized membrane potential
initialization strategy to mitigate the conversion error. Together, these
techniques address the clipping error through adaptive thresholds, dynamically
reduce the quantization error through dual-threshold neurons, and minimize the
non-uniformity error by effectively managing the membrane potential.
Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet datasets show that our
method achieves high-precision and ultra-low latency among existing conversion
methods. Using only two time steps, our method significantly reduces the
inference time while maintains competitive accuracy of 94.75% on CIFAR-10
dataset under ResNet-18 structure. This research promotes the practical
application of SNNs on low-power hardware, making efficient real-time
processing possible.

Conclusion: 为AI抽象推理能力提供了创新方法。

Abstract: This paper thoroughly investigates the challenges of enhancing AI's abstract
reasoning capabilities, with a particular focus on Raven's Progressive Matrices
(RPM) tasks involving complex human-like concepts. Firstly, it dissects the
empirical reality that traditional end-to-end RPM-solving models heavily rely
on option pool configurations, highlighting that this dependency constrains the
model's reasoning capabilities. To address this limitation, the paper proposes
the Johnny architecture - a novel representation space-based framework for
RPM-solving. Through the synergistic operation of its Representation Extraction
Module and Reasoning Module, Johnny significantly enhances reasoning
performance by supplementing primitive negative option configurations with a
learned representation space. Furthermore, to strengthen the model's capacity
for capturing positional relationships among local features, the paper
introduces the Spin-Transformer network architecture, accompanied by a
lightweight Straw Spin-Transformer variant that reduces computational overhead
through parameter sharing and attention mechanism optimization. Experimental
evaluations demonstrate that both Johnny and Spin-Transformer achieve superior
performance on RPM tasks, offering innovative methodologies for advancing AI's
abstract reasoning capabilities.

Result: 任务相关性高时性能提升；即使任务无关，预训练网络仍优于随机；低相关性时重用底层更优。

Conclusion: 预训练网络重用的效果取决于任务语义相关性，且重用层数可反映任务相关性。

Abstract: Pre-trained neural networks are commonly used and reused in the machine
learning community. Alice trains a model for a particular task, and a part of
her neural network is reused by Bob for a different task, often to great
effect. To what can we ascribe Bob's success? This paper introduces an
experimental setup through which factors contributing to Bob's empirical
success could be studied in silico. As a result, we demonstrate that Bob might
just be lucky: his task accuracy increases monotonically with the correlation
between his task and Alice's. Even when Bob has provably uncorrelated tasks and
input features from Alice's pre-trained network, he can achieve significantly
better than random performance due to Alice's choice of network and optimizer.
When there is little correlation between tasks, only reusing lower pre-trained
layers is preferable, and we hypothesize the converse: that the optimal number
of retrained layers is indicative of task and feature correlation. Finally, we
show in controlled real-world scenarios that Bob can effectively reuse Alice's
pre-trained network if there are semantic correlations between his and Alice's
task.

Result: Fusion DeepONet在非断裂情况下表现更优，但在断裂驱动场景中仍有挑战。

Conclusion: Fusion DeepONet在复杂、几何变化和时间依赖的裂纹扩展现象中具有潜力。

Abstract: Accurately modeling crack propagation is critical for predicting failure in
engineering materials and structures, where small cracks can rapidly evolve and
cause catastrophic damage. The interaction of cracks with discontinuities, such
as holes, significantly affects crack deflection and arrest. Recent
developments in discrete particle systems with multibody interactions based on
constitutive behavior have demonstrated the ability to capture crack nucleation
and evolution without relying on continuum assumptions. In this work, we use
data from Constitutively Informed Particle Dynamics (CPD) simulations to train
operator learning models, specifically Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets),
which learn mappings between function spaces instead of finite-dimensional
vectors. We explore two DeepONet variants: vanilla and Fusion DeepONet, for
predicting time-evolving crack propagation in specimens with varying
geometries. Three representative cases are studied: (i) varying notch height
without active fracture; and (ii) and (iii) combinations of notch height and
hole radius where dynamic fracture occurs on irregular discrete meshes. The
models are trained on 32 to 45 samples, using geometric inputs in the branch
network and spatial-temporal coordinates in the trunk network. Results show
that Fusion DeepONet consistently outperforms the vanilla variant, with more
accurate predictions especially in non-fracturing cases. Fracture-driven
scenarios involving displacement and crack evolution remain more challenging.
These findings highlight the potential of Fusion DeepONet to generalize across
complex, geometry-varying, and time-dependent crack propagation phenomena.

Result: 在基准数据集上，GEDRanker实现了接近最优的解决方案质量，无需真实标签。

Conclusion: GEDRanker为无监督GED计算提供了一种高效且实用的方法。

Abstract: Graph Edit Distance (GED) is a fundamental graph similarity metric widely
used in various applications. However, computing GED is an NP-hard problem.
Recent state-of-the-art hybrid GED solver has shown promising performance by
formulating GED as a bipartite graph matching problem, then leveraging a
generative diffusion model to predict node matching between two graphs, from
which both the GED and its corresponding edit path can be extracted using a
traditional algorithm. However, such methods typically rely heavily on
ground-truth supervision, where the ground-truth labels are often costly to
obtain in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose GEDRanker, a novel
unsupervised GAN-based framework for GED computation. Specifically, GEDRanker
consists of a matching-based GED solver and introduces an interpretable
preference-aware discriminator with an effective training strategy to guide the
matching-based GED solver toward generating high-quality node matching without
the need for ground-truth labels. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our GEDRanker enables the matching-based GED solver to achieve
near-optimal solution quality without any ground-truth supervision.

Conclusion: SpecMemo为资源受限环境中的LLM应用提供了高效、低成本的部署方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in speculative decoding have demonstrated considerable
speedup across a wide array of large language model (LLM) tasks. Speculative
decoding inherently relies on sacrificing extra memory allocations to generate
several candidate tokens, of which acceptance rate drives the speedup. However,
deploying speculative decoding on memory-constrained devices, such as mobile
GPUs, remains as a significant challenge in real-world scenarios. In this work,
we present a device-aware inference engine named SpecMemo that can smartly
control memory allocations at finer levels to enable multi-turn chatbots with
speculative decoding on such limited memory devices. Our methodology stems from
theoretically modeling memory footprint of speculative decoding to determine a
lower bound on the required memory budget while retaining speedup. SpecMemo
empirically acquires a careful balance between minimizing redundant memory
allocations for rejected candidate tokens and maintaining competitive
performance gains from speculation. Notably, with SpecMemo's memory management,
we maintain 96% of overall throughput from speculative decoding on MT-Bench,
with reduced generation-memory by 65% on single Nvidia Titan RTX. Given
multiple constrained GPUs, we build on top of previous speculative decoding
architectures to facilitate big-model inference by distributing
Llama-2-70B-Chat model, on which we provide novel batched speculative decoding
to increase usability of multiple small server GPUs. This novel framework
demonstrates 2x speedup over distributed and batched vanilla decoding with the
base model on eight AMD MI250 GPUs. Moreover, inference throughput increases
remarkably 8x with batch size 10. Our work contributes to democratized LLM
applications in resource-constrained environments, providing a pathway for
faster and cheaper deployment of real-world LLM applications with robust
performance.

Abstract: Data inherently possesses dual attributes: samples and targets. For targets,
knowledge distillation has been widely employed to accelerate model
convergence, primarily relying on teacher-generated soft target supervision.
Conversely, recent advancements in data-efficient learning have emphasized
sample optimization techniques, such as dataset distillation, while neglected
the critical role of target. This dichotomy motivates our investigation into
understanding how both sample and target collectively influence training
dynamic. To address this gap, we first establish a taxonomy of existing
paradigms through the lens of sample-target interactions, categorizing them
into distinct sample-to-target mapping strategies. Building upon this
foundation, we then propose a novel unified loss framework to assess their
impact on training efficiency. Through extensive empirical studies on our
proposed strategies, we comprehensively analyze how variations in target and
sample types, quantities, and qualities influence model training, providing six
key insights to enhance training efficacy.

Conclusion: 替代可解释性图有效解决了随机森林模型在健康信息学中的解释性问题。

Abstract: The field of health informatics has been profoundly influenced by the
development of random forest models, which have led to significant advances in
the interpretability of feature interactions. These models are characterized by
their robustness to overfitting and parallelization, making them particularly
useful in this domain. However, the increasing number of features and
estimators in random forests can prevent domain experts from accurately
interpreting global feature interactions, thereby compromising trust and
regulatory compliance. A method called the surrogate interpretability graph has
been developed to address this issue. It uses graphs and mixed-integer linear
programming to analyze and visualize feature interactions. This improves their
interpretability by visualizing the feature usage per
decision-feature-interaction table and the most dominant hierarchical decision
feature interactions for predictions. The implementation of a surrogate
interpretable graph enhances global interpretability, which is critical for
such a high-stakes domain.

Conclusion: CRA-DL通过编码梯度缩小差异，显著提升了对抗拜占庭攻击的鲁棒性和学习效果。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of distributed learning (DL) in the
presence of Byzantine attacks. For this problem, various robust bounded
aggregation (RBA) rules have been proposed at the central server to mitigate
the impact of Byzantine attacks. However, current DL methods apply RBA rules
for the local gradients from the honest devices and the disruptive information
from Byzantine devices, and the learning performance degrades significantly
when the local gradients of different devices vary considerably from each
other. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new DL method to cope with
Byzantine attacks based on coded robust aggregation (CRA-DL). Before training
begins, the training data are allocated to the devices redundantly. During
training, in each iteration, the honest devices transmit coded gradients to the
server computed from the allocated training data, and the server then
aggregates the information received from both honest and Byzantine devices
using RBA rules. In this way, the global gradient can be approximately
recovered at the server to update the global model. Compared with current DL
methods applying RBA rules, the improvement of CRA-DL is attributed to the fact
that the coded gradients sent by the honest devices are closer to each other.
This closeness enhances the robustness of the aggregation against Byzantine
attacks, since Byzantine messages tend to be significantly different from those
of honest devices in this case. We theoretically analyze the convergence
performance of CRA-DL. Finally, we present numerical results to verify the
superiority of the proposed method over existing baselines, showing its
enhanced learning performance under Byzantine attacks.

Abstract: Effective agent exploration remains a core challenge in reinforcement
learning (RL) for complex discrete state-space environments, particularly under
partial observability. This paper presents a decoupled hierarchical RL
framework integrating state abstraction (DcHRL-SA) to address this issue. The
proposed method employs a dual-level architecture, consisting of a high level
RL-based actor and a low-level rule-based policy, to promote effective
exploration. Additionally, state abstraction method is incorporated to cluster
discrete states, effectively lowering state dimensionality. Experiments
conducted in two discrete customized grid environments demonstrate that the
proposed approach consistently outperforms PPO in terms of exploration
efficiency, convergence speed, cumulative reward, and policy stability. These
results demonstrate a practical approach for integrating decoupled hierarchical
policies and state abstraction in discrete grids with large-scale exploration
space. Code will be available at https://github.com/XQY169/DcHRL-SA.

Abstract: Ensemble clustering has demonstrated great success in practice; however, its
theoretical foundations remain underexplored. This paper examines the
generalization performance of ensemble clustering, focusing on generalization
error, excess risk and consistency. We derive a convergence rate of
generalization error bound and excess risk bound both of
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\frac{\log n}{m}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$, with $n$ and $m$
being the numbers of samples and base clusterings. Based on this, we prove that
when $m$ and $n$ approach infinity and $m$ is significantly larger than log
$n$, i.e., $m,n\to \infty, m\gg \log n$, ensemble clustering is consistent.
Furthermore, recognizing that $n$ and $m$ are finite in practice, the
generalization error cannot be reduced to zero. Thus, by assigning varying
weights to finite clusterings, we minimize the error between the empirical
average clusterings and their expectation. From this, we theoretically
demonstrate that to achieve better clustering performance, we should minimize
the deviation (bias) of base clustering from its expectation and maximize the
differences (diversity) among various base clusterings. Additionally, we derive
that maximizing diversity is nearly equivalent to a robust (min-max)
optimization model. Finally, we instantiate our theory to develop a new
ensemble clustering algorithm. Compared with SOTA methods, our approach
achieves average improvements of 6.1%, 7.3%, and 6.0% on 10 datasets w.r.t.

Abstract: Introduction: Personal identification is a critical aspect of forensic
sciences, security, and healthcare. While conventional biometrics systems such
as DNA profiling and iris scanning offer high accuracy, they are time-consuming
and costly. Objectives: This study investigates the relationship between
fingerprint patterns and ABO blood group classification to explore potential
correlations between these two traits. Methods: The study analyzed 200
individuals, categorizing their fingerprints into three types: loops, whorls,
and arches. Blood group classification was also recorded. Statistical analysis,
including chi-square and Pearson correlation tests, was used to assess
associations between fingerprint patterns and blood groups. Results: Loops were
the most common fingerprint pattern, while blood group O+ was the most
prevalent among the participants. Statistical analysis revealed no significant
correlation between fingerprint patterns and blood groups (p > 0.05),
suggesting that these traits are independent. Conclusions: Although the study
showed limited correlation between fingerprint patterns and ABO blood groups,
it highlights the importance of future research using larger and more diverse
populations, incorporating machine learning approaches, and integrating
multiple biometric signals. This study contributes to forensic science by
emphasizing the need for rigorous protocols and comprehensive investigations in
personal identification.

Abstract: The ability to learn and retain a wide variety of tasks is a hallmark of
human intelligence that has inspired research in artificial general
intelligence. Continual learning approaches provide a significant step towards
achieving this goal. It has been known that task variability and context
switching are challenging for learning in neural networks. Catastrophic
forgetting refers to the poor performance on retention of a previously learned
task when a new task is being learned. Switching between different task
contexts can be a useful approach to mitigate the same by preventing the
interference between the varying task weights of the network. This paper
introduces Elastic Weight Generative Networks (EWGN) as an idea for context
switching between two different tasks. The proposed EWGN architecture uses an
additional network that generates the weights of the primary network
dynamically while consolidating the weights learned. The weight generation is
input-dependent and thus enables context switching. Using standard computer
vision datasets, namely MNIST and fashion-MNIST, we analyse the retention of
previously learned task representations in Fully Connected Networks,
Convolutional Neural Networks, and EWGN architectures with Stochastic Gradient
Descent and Elastic Weight Consolidation learning algorithms. Understanding
dynamic weight generation and context-switching ability can be useful in
enabling continual learning for improved performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ODLRI的方法，通过将低秩组件专门用于捕获激活敏感权重，优化了权重矩阵的分解，从而在量化与低秩近似之间取得更好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联合优化方法在量化与低秩近似之间交替迭代，但往往偏重一方，导致分解效果不佳。

Method: 引入ODLRI方法，将低秩组件专门用于捕获激活敏感权重，以减少异常值对量化的负面影响。

Result: 在多个LLM模型上的实验表明，ODLRI能降低激活感知误差、减小量化尺度，并提升低比特设置下的困惑度和零样本准确率。

Conclusion: ODLRI通过结构化分解有效平衡了量化与低秩近似，提升了模型压缩效果。

Abstract: Decomposing weight matrices into quantization and low-rank components
($\mathbf{W} \approx \mathbf{Q} + \mathbf{L}\mathbf{R}$) is a widely used
technique for compressing large language models (LLMs). Existing joint
optimization methods iteratively alternate between quantization and low-rank
approximation. However, these methods tend to prioritize one component at the
expense of the other, resulting in suboptimal decompositions that fail to
leverage each component's unique strengths. In this work, we introduce
Outlier-Driven Low-Rank Initialization (ODLRI), which assigns low-rank
components the specific role of capturing activation-sensitive weights. This
structured decomposition mitigates outliers' negative impact on quantization,
enabling more effective balance between quantization and low-rank
approximation. Experiments on Llama2 (7B, 13B, 70B), Llama3-8B, and Mistral-7B
demonstrate that incorporating ODLRI into the joint optimization framework
consistently reduces activation-aware error, minimizes quantization scale, and
improves perplexity and zero-shot accuracy in low-bit settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MaskedOptim的两阶段优化框架，用于解决联邦学习中的复杂标签噪声问题，通过检测噪声客户端和标签校正机制提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在隐私敏感应用中取得进展，但客户端提供的标注数据可能存在复杂标签噪声，影响模型性能，需开发优化策略。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段检测高噪声率客户端，第二阶段通过端到端标签校正机制修正噪声数据标签，并采用几何中值模型聚合增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该框架在不同场景下表现鲁棒，且能有效提升噪声客户端本地数据集的质量。

Conclusion: MaskedOptim框架成功解决了联邦学习中的标签噪声问题，显著提升了模型性能和数据质量。

Abstract: In recent years, federated learning (FL) has made significant advance in
privacy-sensitive applications. However, it can be hard to ensure that FL
participants provide well-annotated data for training. The corresponding
annotations from different clients often contain complex label noise at varying
levels. This label noise issue has a substantial impact on the performance of
the trained models, and clients with greater noise levels can be largely
attributed for this degradation. To this end, it is necessary to develop an
effective optimization strategy to alleviate the adverse effects of these noisy
clients.In this study, we present a two-stage optimization framework,
MaskedOptim, to address this intricate label noise problem. The first stage is
designed to facilitate the detection of noisy clients with higher label noise
rates. The second stage focuses on rectifying the labels of the noisy clients'
data through an end-to-end label correction mechanism, aiming to mitigate the
negative impacts caused by misinformation within datasets. This is achieved by
learning the potential ground-truth labels of the noisy clients' datasets via
backpropagation. To further enhance the training robustness, we apply the
geometric median based model aggregation instead of the commonly-used vanilla
averaged model aggregation. We implement sixteen related methods and conduct
evaluations on three image datasets and one text dataset with diverse label
noise patterns for a comprehensive comparison. Extensive experimental results
indicate that our proposed framework shows its robustness in different
scenarios. Additionally, our label correction framework effectively enhances
the data quality of the detected noisy clients' local datasets. % Our codes
will be open-sourced to facilitate related research communities. Our codes are
available via https://github.com/Sprinter1999/MaskedOptim .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列基础模型在不同领域和任务中表现不一，且缺乏利用示例或指令的能力，限制了其在异常检测中的应用。

Method: 提出RATFM，通过检索增强机制，使预训练模型能够结合测试时适应的示例。

Result: 在UCR异常档案数据集上验证，RATFM性能接近领域内微调。

Conclusion: RATFM有效解决了时间序列基础模型在异常检测中的局限性，无需领域依赖微调。

Abstract: Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language
processing, recent research has explored the building of time series foundation
models and applied them to tasks such as forecasting, classification, and
anomaly detection. However, their performances vary between different domains
and tasks. In LLM-based approaches, test-time adaptation using example-based
prompting has become common, owing to the high cost of retraining. In the
context of anomaly detection, which is the focus of this study, providing
normal examples from the target domain can also be effective. However, time
series foundation models do not naturally acquire the ability to interpret or
utilize examples or instructions, because the nature of time series data used
during training does not encourage such capabilities. To address this
limitation, we propose a retrieval augmented time series foundation model
(RATFM), which enables pretrained time series foundation models to incorporate
examples of test-time adaptation. We show that RATFM achieves a performance
comparable to that of in-domain fine-tuning while avoiding domain-dependent
fine-tuning. Experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive, a multi-domain dataset
including nine domains, confirms the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TCS的框架，用于生成真实的时间序列数据及其相关的时间因果图，解决了现有方法在模拟真实场景中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法依赖合成数据，但这些数据难以准确反映真实世界，尤其是在时间序列数据中。

Method: TCS框架分为三阶段：估计数据的滞后因果结构、近似变量间的函数依赖关系、学习因果模型的噪声分布，并结合AutoML技术进行优化。

Result: 实验表明，TCS能够生成更真实的因果数据，并通过综合评估验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: TCS为生成真实时间因果数据提供了灵活且模型无关的解决方案，尽管任务复杂，但显著提升了数据质量。

Abstract: Causal Discovery plays a pivotal role in revealing relationships among
observed variables, particularly in the temporal setup. While the majority of
CD methods rely on synthetic data for evaluation, and recently for training,
these fall short in accurately mirroring real-world scenarios; an effect even
more evident in temporal data. Generation techniques depending on simplified
assumptions on causal structure, effects and time, limit the quality and
diversity of the simulated data. In this work, we introduce Temporal
Causal-based Simulation (TCS), a robust framework for generating realistic
time-series data and their associated temporal causal graphs. The approach is
structured in three phases: estimating the true lagged causal structure of the
data, approximating the functional dependencies between variables and learning
the noise distribution of the corresponding causal model, each part of which
can be explicitly tailored based on data assumptions and characteristics.
Through an extensive evaluation process, we highlight that single detection
methods for generated data discrimination prove inadequate, accentuating it as
a multifaceted challenge. For this, we detail a Min-max optimization phase that
draws on AutoML techniques. Our contributions include a flexible,
model-agnostic pipeline for generating realistic temporal causal data, a
thorough evaluation setup which enhances the validity of the generated datasets
and insights into the challenges posed by realistic data generation. Through
experiments involving not only real but also semi-synthetic and purely
synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that while sampling realistic causal data
remains a complex task, our method enriches the domain of generating sensible
causal-based temporal data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer transformative capabilities for hardware

pose significant data security challenges, including Verilog evaluation data
contamination, intellectual property (IP) design leakage, and the risk of
malicious Verilog generation. We introduce SALAD, a comprehensive assessment
that leverages machine unlearning to mitigate these threats. Our approach
enables the selective removal of contaminated benchmarks, sensitive IP and
design artifacts, or malicious code patterns from pre-trained LLMs, all without
requiring full retraining. Through detailed case studies, we demonstrate how
machine unlearning techniques effectively reduce data security risks in
LLM-aided hardware design.

Conclusion: LCBM在保持可解释性的同时，提升了性能和人类可理解性，为深度神经网络的可信度提供了新方向。

Abstract: To increase the trustworthiness of deep neural networks, it is critical to
improve the understanding of how they make decisions. This paper introduces a
novel unsupervised concept-based model for image classification, named
Learnable Concept-Based Model (LCBM) which models concepts as random variables
within a Bernoulli latent space. Unlike traditional methods that either require
extensive human supervision or suffer from limited scalability, our approach
employs a reduced number of concepts without sacrificing performance. We
demonstrate that LCBM surpasses existing unsupervised concept-based models in
generalization capability and nearly matches the performance of black-box
models. The proposed concept representation enhances information retention and
aligns more closely with human understanding. A user study demonstrates the
discovered concepts are also more intuitive for humans to interpret. Finally,
despite the use of concept embeddings, we maintain model interpretability by
means of a local linear combination of concepts.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) trained via reinforcement learning with
verifiable reward (RLVR) have shown notable progress in scaling test-time
compute effectively. In this work, we investigate how synthesized RL data can
further improve RLVR. To this end, we propose \textbf{SynthRL}-a scalable and
guaranteed pipeline for automatic data scaling in reasoning-oriented RL
training. SynthRL comprises three key stages: (1) selecting seed questions with
appropriate distribution, (2) augmenting them into more challenging variants
while preserving the original answers, and (3) a guaranteed verification stage
that ensures near-perfect correctness and difficulty enhancement. Our empirical
experiments demonstrate SynthRL's scalability and effectiveness. When applied
to the MMK12 dataset, SynthRL synthesizes over 3.3K additional verifiable,
challenging questions from approximately 8K seed samples. Models trained with
our synthesized data achieve consistent gains across five out-of-domain visual
math reasoning benchmarks, with a significant improvement over baseline models
trained on seed data alone. Notably, detailed analysis reveals that the gains
are more pronounced on the most challenging evaluation samples, highlighting
SynthRL's effectiveness in eliciting deeper and more complex reasoning
patterns.

Result: 实验表明，ReconXF在多个数据集上优于现有方法，AUC和平均精度均有提升。

Conclusion: 公开解释结合去噪机制能在隐私保护下有效恢复图结构，揭示了隐私与透明性之间的权衡。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) achieve high performance across many
applications but function as black-box models, limiting their use in critical
domains like healthcare and criminal justice. Explainability methods address
this by providing feature-level explanations that identify important node
attributes for predictions. These explanations create privacy risks. Combined
with auxiliary information, feature explanations can enable adversaries to
reconstruct graph structure, exposing sensitive relationships. Existing graph
reconstruction attacks assume access to original auxiliary data, but practical
systems use differential privacy to protect node features and labels while
providing explanations for transparency. We study a threat model where
adversaries access public feature explanations along with privatized node
features and labels. We show that existing explanation-based attacks like GSEF
perform poorly with privatized data due to noise from differential privacy
mechanisms. We propose ReconXF, a graph reconstruction attack for scenarios
with public explanations and privatized auxiliary data. Our method adapts
explanation-based frameworks by incorporating denoising mechanisms that handle
differential privacy noise while exploiting structural signals in explanations.
Experiments across multiple datasets show ReconXF outperforms SoTA methods in
privatized settings, with improvements in AUC and average precision. Results
indicate that public explanations combined with denoising enable graph
structure recovery even under the privacy protection of auxiliary data. Code is
available at (link to be made public after acceptance).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LRP方法在解释Transformer时完全忽略了位置编码（PE），导致守恒性被破坏，且丢失了与结构和位置特征相关的重要相关性。

Method: 将输入空间重新定义为位置-标记对，并设计了专门的理论基础LRP规则，适用于多种位置编码方法（如Rotary、Learnable和Absolute PE）。

Result: 在微调分类器和零样本基础模型（如LLaMA 3）上的实验表明，该方法在视觉和NLP解释任务中显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 通过改进LRP方法以纳入位置编码，显著提升了Transformer模型的可解释性。

Abstract: The development of effective explainability tools for Transformers is a
crucial pursuit in deep learning research. One of the most promising approaches
in this domain is Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), which propagates
relevance scores backward through the network to the input space by
redistributing activation values based on predefined rules. However, existing
LRP-based methods for Transformer explainability entirely overlook a critical
component of the Transformer architecture: its positional encoding (PE),
resulting in violation of the conservation property, and the loss of an
important and unique type of relevance, which is also associated with
structural and positional features. To address this limitation, we reformulate
the input space for Transformer explainability as a set of position-token
pairs. This allows us to propose specialized theoretically-grounded LRP rules
designed to propagate attributions across various positional encoding methods,
including Rotary, Learnable, and Absolute PE. Extensive experiments with both
fine-tuned classifiers and zero-shot foundation models, such as LLaMA 3,
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in
both vision and NLP explainability tasks. Our code is publicly available.

Abstract: Outliers introduce significant training challenges in neural networks by

generalization. We propose the Z-Error Loss, a statistically principled
approach that minimizes outlier influence during training by masking the
contribution of data points identified as out-of-distribution within each
batch. This method leverages batch-level statistics to automatically detect and
exclude anomalous samples, allowing the model to focus its learning on the true
underlying data structure. Our approach is robust, adaptive to data quality,
and provides valuable diagnostics for data curation and cleaning.

Conclusion: 强调了近似理论在机器学习中的重要性，并展示了新方法的潜力。

Abstract: A central problem in machine learning is often formulated as follows: Given a
dataset $\{(x_j, y_j)\}_{j=1}^M$, which is a sample drawn from an unknown
probability distribution, the goal is to construct a functional model $f$ such
that $f(x) \approx y$ for any $(x, y)$ drawn from the same distribution. Neural
networks and kernel-based methods are commonly employed for this task due to
their capacity for fast and parallel computation. The approximation
capabilities, or expressive power, of these methods have been extensively
studied over the past 35 years. In this paper, we will present examples of key
ideas in this area found in the literature. We will discuss emerging trends in
machine learning including the role of shallow/deep networks, approximation on
manifolds, physics-informed neural surrogates, neural operators, and
transformer architectures. Despite function approximation being a fundamental
problem in machine learning, approximation theory does not play a central role
in the theoretical foundations of the field. One unfortunate consequence of
this disconnect is that it is often unclear how well trained models will
generalize to unseen or unlabeled data. In this review, we examine some of the
shortcomings of the current machine learning framework and explore the reasons
for the gap between approximation theory and machine learning practice. We will
then introduce our novel research to achieve function approximation on unknown
manifolds without the need to learn specific manifold features, such as the
eigen-decomposition of the Laplace-Beltrami operator or atlas construction. In
many machine learning problems, particularly classification tasks, the labels
$y_j$ are drawn from a finite set of values.

Result: 理论和实验表明，该方法能识别优化结果预测的方向，优于传统两阶段方法。

Conclusion: 新方法为高维内生变量处理提供了更有效的框架，减少了遗漏变量偏差。

Abstract: Traditional instrumental variable (IV) estimators face a fundamental
constraint: they can only accommodate as many endogenous treatment variables as
available instruments. This limitation becomes particularly challenging in
settings where the treatment is presented in a high-dimensional and
unstructured manner (e.g. descriptions of patient treatment pathways in a
hospital). In such settings, researchers typically resort to applying
unsupervised dimension reduction techniques to learn a low-dimensional
treatment representation prior to implementing IV regression analysis. We show
that such methods can suffer from substantial omitted variable bias due to
implicit regularization in the representation learning step. We propose a novel
approach to construct treatment representations by explicitly incorporating
instrumental variables during the representation learning process. Our approach
provides a framework for handling high-dimensional endogenous variables with
limited instruments. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that
fitting IV models on these instrument-informed representations ensures
identification of directions that optimize outcome prediction. Our experiments
show that our proposed methodology improves upon the conventional two-stage
approaches that perform dimension reduction without incorporating instrument
information.

Result: 在图像、点云和蛋白质序列等基础模型上验证了方法的有效性，能够学习更具信息量的切片方向。

Conclusion: 提出的约束学习方法显著提升了SW距离的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distances offer an efficient method for comparing
high-dimensional probability measures by projecting them onto multiple
1-dimensional probability distributions. However, identifying informative
slicing directions has proven challenging, often necessitating a large number
of slices to achieve desirable performance and thereby increasing computational
complexity. We introduce a constrained learning approach to optimize the
slicing directions for SW distances. Specifically, we constrain the 1D
transport plans to approximate the optimal plan in the original space, ensuring
meaningful slicing directions. By leveraging continuous relaxations of these
transport plans, we enable a gradient-based primal-dual approach to train the
slicer parameters, alongside the remaining model parameters. We demonstrate how
this constrained slicing approach can be applied to pool high-dimensional
embeddings into fixed-length permutation-invariant representations. Numerical
results on foundation models trained on images, point clouds, and protein
sequences showcase the efficacy of the proposed constrained learning approach
in learning more informative slicing directions. Our implementation code can be
found at https://github.com/Stranja572/constrainedswe.

Conclusion: $\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM是一种简单有效的CEM改进方法。

Abstract: The Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) is a widely adopted trajectory optimizer in
model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), but its unimodal sampling strategy
often leads to premature convergence in multimodal landscapes. In this work, we
propose Bregman Centroid Guided CEM ($\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM), a lightweight
enhancement to ensemble CEM that leverages $\textit{Bregman centroids}$ for
principled information aggregation and diversity control.
$\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ computes a performance-weighted Bregman
centroid across CEM workers and updates the least contributing ones by sampling
within a trust region around the centroid. Leveraging the duality between
Bregman divergences and exponential family distributions, we show that
$\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ integrates seamlessly into standard CEM
pipelines with negligible overhead. Empirical results on synthetic benchmarks,
a cluttered navigation task, and full MBRL pipelines demonstrate that
$\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ enhances both convergence and solution
quality, providing a simple yet effective upgrade for CEM.

TL;DR: KDRL是一个结合知识蒸馏（KD）和强化学习（RL）的统一后训练框架，旨在提升大语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL能产生复杂推理行为但样本效率低，KD学习效率高但泛化能力差，因此需要结合两者优势。

Method: KDRL通过策略梯度优化同时最小化学生与教师分布的RKL散度并最大化规则奖励，探索不同KL近似和奖励策略的影响。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，KDRL优于GRPO和KD基线，平衡了性能和推理效率。

Conclusion: 结合KD和RL是训练推理LLM的有效高效策略。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) post-training have leveraged
two distinct paradigms to enhance reasoning capabilities: reinforcement
learning (RL) and knowledge distillation (KD). While RL enables the emergence
of complex reasoning behaviors, it often suffers from low sample efficiency
when the initial policy struggles to explore high-reward trajectories.
Conversely, KD improves learning efficiency via mimicking the teacher model but
tends to generalize poorly to out-of-domain scenarios. In this work, we present
\textbf{KDRL}, a \textit{unified post-training framework} that jointly
optimizes a reasoning model through teacher supervision (KD) and
self-exploration (RL). Specifically, KDRL leverages policy gradient
optimization to simultaneously minimize the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence
(RKL) between the student and teacher distributions while maximizing the
expected rule-based rewards. We first formulate a unified objective that
integrates GRPO and KD, and systematically explore how different KL
approximations, KL coefficients, and reward-guided KD strategies affect the
overall post-training dynamics and performance. Empirical results on multiple
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that KDRL outperforms GRPO and various KD
baselines while achieving a favorable balance between performance and reasoning
token efficiency. These findings indicate that integrating KD and RL serves as
an effective and efficient strategy to train reasoning LLMs.

Motivation: 神经网络参数冗余问题日益突出，对称性作为冗余的一种形式尚未被充分用于高效推理。

Method: 基于参数和中间值的可交换性统计特性，提出动态剪枝算法ExPrune，通过预测ReLU负输入实现神经元级剪枝。

Conclusion: ExPrune有效利用对称性冗余，动态剪枝效果显著，且能与静态剪枝结合进一步提升效率。

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) are equipped with increasingly many parameters and
require more and more resource for deployment. Researchers have explored
various ways to improve the efficiency of NNs by identifying and reducing the
redundancy, such as pruning or quantizing unimportant weights. Symmetry in the
NN architectures has been identified by prior work as a possible type of
redundancy, but exploiting it for efficient inference is not yet explored. In
this work, we formalize the symmetry of parameters and intermediate values in
NNs using the statistical property of exchangeablility. We identify that
exchangeable values in NN computation may contain overlapping information,
leading to redundancy. Exploiting the insight, we derive a principled general
dynamic pruning algorithm ExPrune to remove symmetry-induced redundancy on a
per-input basis. We also provide an instantiation of ExPrune that performs
neuron-level dynamic pruning by predicting negative inputs to ReLU activations.
We evaluate ExPrune on two computer vision models, one graph model and one
language model. ExPrune provides 10.98--26.3% reduction in FLOPs with
negligible accuracy drop and 21.01--39.05% reduction in FLOPs with at most 1%
accuracy drop. We also demonstrate that ExPrune composes with static pruning.
On models that have been aggressively pruned statically, ExPrune provides
additional 10.24--11.11% reduction in FLOPs with negligible accuracy drop and
13.91--14.39% reduction in FLOPs with at most 1% accuracy drop.

Abstract: Learning on small data is a challenge frequently encountered in many
real-world applications. In this work we study how effective quantum ensemble
models are when trained on small data problems in healthcare and life sciences.
We constructed multiple types of quantum ensembles for binary classification
using up to 26 qubits in simulation and 56 qubits on quantum hardware. Our
ensemble designs use minimal trainable parameters but require long-range
connections between qubits. We tested these quantum ensembles on synthetic
datasets and gene expression data from renal cell carcinoma patients with the
task of predicting patient response to immunotherapy. From the performance
observed in simulation and initial hardware experiments, we demonstrate how
quantum embedding structure affects performance and discuss how to extract
informative features and build models that can learn and generalize
effectively. We present these exploratory results in order to assist other
researchers in the design of effective learning on small data using ensembles.
Incorporating quantum computing in these data constrained problems offers hope
for a wide range of studies in healthcare and life sciences where biological
samples are relatively scarce given the feature space to be explored.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖人工提出假设，耗时且易受偏见影响；深度学习模型解释性差；未充分利用非结构化数据。

Result: 在曼哈顿街区的实验中，UrbanX优于预训练深度学习模型，同时保持完全可解释性。

Conclusion: UrbanX为城市科学发现提供了一种可扩展、统计可靠且可解释的框架，适用于多种社会经济和环境问题。

Abstract: Urban and transportation research has long sought to uncover statistically
meaningful relationships between key variables and societal outcomes such as
road safety, to generate actionable insights that guide the planning,
development, and renewal of urban and transportation systems. However,
traditional workflows face several key challenges: (1) reliance on human
experts to propose hypotheses, which is time-consuming and prone to
confirmation bias; (2) limited interpretability, particularly in deep learning
approaches; and (3) underutilization of unstructured data that can encode
critical urban context. Given these limitations, we propose a Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM)-based approach for interpretable hypothesis inference,
enabling the automated generation, evaluation, and refinement of hypotheses
concerning urban context and road safety outcomes. Our method leverages MLLMs
to craft safety-relevant questions for street view images (SVIs), extract
interpretable embeddings from their responses, and apply them in
regression-based statistical models. UrbanX supports iterative hypothesis
testing and refinement, guided by statistical evidence such as coefficient
significance, thereby enabling rigorous scientific discovery of previously
overlooked correlations between urban design and safety. Experimental
evaluations on Manhattan street segments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms pretrained deep learning models while offering full
interpretability. Beyond road safety, UrbanX can serve as a general-purpose
framework for urban scientific discovery, extracting structured insights from
unstructured urban data across diverse socioeconomic and environmental
outcomes. This approach enhances model trustworthiness for policy applications
and establishes a scalable, statistically grounded pathway for interpretable
knowledge discovery in urban and transportation studies.

Result: auGraph在关系型和表格预测任务中优于基于模式和启发式的图构建方法。

Conclusion: auGraph通过任务感知的图增强，显著提升了预测性能，同时保留了原始数据模式。

Abstract: Tabular and relational data remain the most ubiquitous formats in real-world
machine learning applications, spanning domains from finance to healthcare.
Although both formats offer structured representations, they pose distinct
challenges for modern deep learning methods, which typically assume flat,
feature-aligned inputs. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a
promising solution by capturing structural dependencies within and between
tables. However, existing GNN-based approaches often rely on rigid,
schema-derived graphs -- such as those based on primary-foreign key links --
thereby underutilizing rich, predictive signals in non key attributes. In this
work, we introduce auGraph, a unified framework for task-aware graph
augmentation that applies to both tabular and relational data. auGraph enhances
base graph structures by selectively promoting attributes into nodes, guided by
scoring functions that quantify their relevance to the downstream prediction
task. This augmentation preserves the original data schema while injecting
task-relevant structural signal. Empirically, auGraph outperforms schema-based
and heuristic graph construction methods by producing graphs that better
support learning for relational and tabular prediction tasks.

Abstract: Most existing safe reinforcement learning (RL) benchmarks focus on robotics
and control tasks, offering limited relevance to high-stakes domains that
involve structured constraints, mixed-integer decisions, and industrial
complexity. This gap hinders the advancement and deployment of safe RL in
critical areas such as energy systems, manufacturing, and supply chains. To
address this limitation, we present SafeOR-Gym, a benchmark suite of nine
operations research (OR) environments tailored for safe RL under complex
constraints. Each environment captures a realistic planning, scheduling, or
control problems characterized by cost-based constraint violations, planning
horizons, and hybrid discrete-continuous action spaces. The suite integrates
seamlessly with the Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) interface
provided by OmniSafe. We evaluate several state-of-the-art safe RL algorithms
across these environments, revealing a wide range of performance: while some
tasks are tractable, others expose fundamental limitations in current
approaches. SafeOR-Gym provides a challenging and practical testbed that aims
to catalyze future research in safe RL for real-world decision-making problems.

Conclusion: HHISS在敏感现实应用中具有可行性和可扩展性，为移动压力感知提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Stress affects physical and mental health, and wearable devices have been
widely used to detect daily stress through physiological signals. However,
these signals vary due to factors such as individual differences and health
conditions, making generalizing machine learning models difficult. To address
these challenges, we present Human Heterogeneity Invariant Stress Sensing
(HHISS), a domain generalization approach designed to find consistent patterns
in stress signals by removing person-specific differences. This helps the model
perform more accurately across new people, environments, and stress types not
seen during training. Its novelty lies in proposing a novel technique called
person-wise sub-network pruning intersection to focus on shared features across
individuals, alongside preventing overfitting by leveraging continuous labels
while training. The study focuses especially on people with opioid use disorder
(OUD)-a group where stress responses can change dramatically depending on their
time of daily medication taking. Since stress often triggers cravings, a model
that can adapt well to these changes could support better OUD rehabilitation
and recovery. We tested HHISS on seven different stress datasets-four of which
we collected ourselves and three public ones. Four are from lab setups, one
from a controlled real-world setting, driving, and two are from real-world
in-the-wild field datasets without any constraints. This is the first study to
evaluate how well a stress detection model works across such a wide range of
data. Results show HHISS consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baseline
methods, proving both effective and practical for real-world use. Ablation
studies, empirical justifications, and runtime evaluations confirm HHISS's
feasibility and scalability for mobile stress sensing in sensitive real-world
applications.

Result: 发现等变子空间的损失景观受无约束模型参数对称性的影响，某些条件下会阻碍学习全局最小值；放松约束可解决问题。

Conclusion: 提出三点关键结论：1）在更大无约束函数空间中分析网络；2）等变网络形成复杂线性超平面；3）放松等变需重新思考隐藏层群表示。

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks have proven to be effective for tasks with known
underlying symmetries. However, optimizing equivariant networks can be tricky
and best training practices are less established than for standard networks. In
particular, recent works have found small training benefits from relaxing
equivariance constraints. This raises the question: do equivariance constraints
introduce fundamental obstacles to optimization? Or do they simply require
different hyperparameter tuning? In this work, we investigate this question
through a theoretical analysis of the loss landscape geometry. We focus on
networks built using permutation representations, which we can view as a subset
of unconstrained MLPs. Importantly, we show that the parameter symmetries of
the unconstrained model has nontrivial effects on the loss landscape of the
equivariant subspace and under certain conditions can provably prevent learning
of the global minima. Further, we empirically demonstrate in such cases,
relaxing to an unconstrained MLP can sometimes solve the issue. Interestingly,
the weights eventually found via relaxation corresponds to a different choice
of group representation in the hidden layer. From this, we draw 3 key
takeaways. (1) Viewing any class of networks in the context of larger
unconstrained function space can give important insights on loss landscape
structure. (2) Within the unconstrained function space, equivariant networks
form a complicated union of linear hyperplanes, each associated with a specific
choice of internal group representation. (3) Effective relaxation of
equivariance may require not only adding nonequivariant degrees of freedom, but
also rethinking the fixed choice of group representations in hidden layers.

Result: LSI在ImageNet生成基准测试中表现优异，有效学习潜在表示并实现灵活的生成过程。

Conclusion: LSI成功规避了传统扩散模型的简单先验限制，同时保留了SI框架的生成灵活性。

Abstract: Stochastic Interpolants (SI) are a powerful framework for generative
modeling, capable of flexibly transforming between two probability
distributions. However, their use in jointly optimized latent variable models
remains unexplored as they require direct access to the samples from the two
distributions. This work presents Latent Stochastic Interpolants (LSI) enabling
joint learning in a latent space with end-to-end optimized encoder, decoder and
latent SI models. We achieve this by developing a principled Evidence Lower
Bound (ELBO) objective derived directly in continuous time. The joint
optimization allows LSI to learn effective latent representations along with a
generative process that transforms an arbitrary prior distribution into the
encoder-defined aggregated posterior. LSI sidesteps the simple priors of the
normal diffusion models and mitigates the computational demands of applying SI
directly in high-dimensional observation spaces, while preserving the
generative flexibility of the SI framework. We demonstrate the efficacy of LSI
through comprehensive experiments on the standard large scale ImageNet
generation benchmark.

Conclusion: GAIN-RL通过模型内在信号优化数据选择，显著提升训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Current Reinforcement Fine-tuning (RFT) paradigms for Large Language Models
(LLMs) suffer from sample inefficiency due to the redundant exposure of
identical queries under uniform data sampling. While previous work has explored
curriculum learning via heuristic difficulty metrics, these strategies exhibit
limitations by neglecting the intrinsic learning signals generated by the model
itself, thus leading to suboptimal training regimes. In this paper, we identify
a model-inherent signal termed angle concentration that effectively reflects an
LLM's capacity to learn from specific data. We theoretically and empirically
demonstrate a correlation between the angular distribution of token hidden
state vectors and the resulting gradient, revealing a learning preference for
data exhibiting higher angle concentration. Inspired by this finding, we
propose GAIN-RL, a Gradient-driven Angle-Informed Navigated RL framework. By
leveraging the model's intrinsic angle concentration signal, GAIN-RL
dynamically selects training data in each epoch, ensuring consistently
impactful gradient updates and thus significantly enhancing overall training
efficiency. Empirical evaluations show that GAIN-RL (GRPO) achieves over a 2.5x
acceleration in training efficiency across diverse mathematical and coding
tasks and varying model scales. Furthermore, GAIN-RL (GRPO)'s efficient
sampling yields data-efficient training, achieving better performance with half
the original data compared to vanilla GRPO with full training data. Code is

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks provide a principled framework for incorporating
symmetry into learning architectures and have been extensively analyzed through
the lens of their separation power, that is, the ability to distinguish inputs
modulo symmetry. This notion plays a central role in settings such as graph
learning, where it is often formalized via the Weisfeiler-Leman hierarchy. In
contrast, the universality of equivariant models-their capacity to approximate
target functions-remains comparatively underexplored. In this work, we
investigate the approximation power of equivariant neural networks beyond
separation constraints. We show that separation power does not fully capture
expressivity: models with identical separation power may differ in their
approximation ability. To demonstrate this, we characterize the universality
classes of shallow invariant networks, providing a general framework for
understanding which functions these architectures can approximate. Since
equivariant models reduce to invariant ones under projection, this analysis
yields sufficient conditions under which shallow equivariant networks fail to
be universal. Conversely, we identify settings where shallow models do achieve
separation-constrained universality. These positive results, however, depend
critically on structural properties of the symmetry group, such as the
existence of adequate normal subgroups, which may not hold in important cases
like permutation symmetry.

Conclusion: 该框架为理解神经网络内部表示提供了新的可解释视角。

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations and decision mechanisms of deep
neural networks remains a critical open challenge. While existing
interpretability methods often identify influential input regions, they may not
elucidate how a model distinguishes between classes or what specific changes
would transition an input from one category to another. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel framework that visualizes the implicit path
between classes by treating the network gradient as a form of infinitesimal
motion. Drawing inspiration from phase-based motion magnification, we first
decompose images using invertible transforms-specifically the Complex Steerable
Pyramid-then compute class-conditional gradients in the transformed space.
Rather than iteratively integrating the gradient to trace a full path, we
amplify the one-step gradient to the input and perform a linear extrapolation
to expose how the model moves from source to target class. By operating in the
steerable pyramid domain, these amplified gradients produce semantically
meaningful, spatially coherent morphs that highlight the classifier's most
sensitive directions, giving insight into the geometry of its decision
boundaries. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that our phase-focused extrapolation yields perceptually aligned, semantically
meaningful transformations, offering a novel, interpretable lens into neural
classifiers' internal representations.

Abstract: We present CACTI, a masked autoencoding approach for imputing tabular data

training strategy that encourages the model to learn from empirical patterns of
missingness while incorporating semantic relationships between features -
captured by column names and text descriptions - to better represent feature
dependence. These dual sources of inductive bias enable CACTI to outperform

Result: MINT在多模态指令调优中显著优于现有任务分组基线，平衡了泛化与专业化。

Conclusion: 任务分组策略对多模态模型性能至关重要，MINT提供了一种简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal foundation models have achieved
state-of-the-art performance across a range of tasks. These breakthroughs are
largely driven by new pre-training paradigms that leverage large-scale,
unlabeled multimodal data, followed by instruction fine-tuning on curated
labeled datasets and high-quality prompts. While there is growing interest in
scaling instruction fine-tuning to ever-larger datasets in both quantity and
scale, our findings reveal that simply increasing the number of
instruction-tuning tasks does not consistently yield better performance.
Instead, we observe that grouping tasks by the common interactions across
modalities, such as discovering redundant shared information, prioritizing
modality selection with unique information, or requiring synergistic fusion to
discover new information from both modalities, encourages the models to learn
transferrable skills within a group while suppressing interference from
mismatched tasks. To this end, we introduce MINT, a simple yet surprisingly
effective task-grouping strategy based on the type of multimodal interaction.
We demonstrate that the proposed method greatly outperforms existing task
grouping baselines for multimodal instruction tuning, striking an effective
balance between generalization and specialization.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种消除测试点的新方法，通过高保真数字模型和机器学习生成降阶模型（ROM），能够动态更新和验证飞行测试数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统测试点方法因飞行员偏离预设条件而失效，且数据带和容差问题比飞行员技能不足更根本。

Method: 使用高保真数字模型生成ROM，通过机器学习动态更新模型，基于实际飞行条件生成预测并更新模型。

Result: 通过T-38C飞行测试数据验证，ROM成功更新并生成了符合MIL-STD-1797B标准的纵向动力学参数。

Conclusion: 提出的无测试点架构通过动态更新的ROM，有效解决了传统测试方法的局限性，并验证了高保真模型的准确性。

Abstract: The justification for the "test point" derives from the test pilot's
obligation to reproduce faithfully the pre-specified conditions of some model
prediction. Pilot deviation from those conditions invalidates the model
assumptions. Flight test aids have been proposed to increase accuracy on more
challenging test points. However, the very existence of databands and
tolerances is the problem more fundamental than inadequate pilot skill. We
propose a novel approach, which eliminates test points. We start with a
high-fidelity digital model of an air vehicle. Instead of using this model to
generate a point prediction, we use a machine learning method to produce a
reduced-order model (ROM). The ROM has two important properties. First, it can
generate a prediction based on any set of conditions the pilot flies. Second,
if the test result at those conditions differ from the prediction, the ROM can
be updated using the new data. The outcome of flight test is thus a refined ROM
at whatever conditions were flown. This ROM in turn updates and validates the
high-fidelity model. We present a single example of this "point-less"
architecture, using T-38C flight test data. We first use a generic aircraft
model to build a ROM of longitudinal pitching motion as a hypersurface. We then
ingest unconstrained flight test data and use Gaussian Process Regression to
update and condition the hypersurface. By proposing a second-order equivalent
system for the T-38C, this hypersurface then generates parameters necessary to
assess MIL-STD-1797B compliance for longitudinal dynamics.

Result: 证明了吸收率矩阵下采样器的收敛性，且在某些假设下无需提前停止。

Conclusion: 研究为吸收率矩阵的离散扩散模型提供了理论保障，并提出了新技术工具。

Abstract: Discrete state space diffusion models have shown significant advantages in
applications involving discrete data, such as text and image generation. It has
also been observed that their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of
rate matrices, particularly between uniform and absorbing rate matrices. While
empirical results suggest that absorbing rate matrices often yield better
generation quality compared to uniform rate matrices, existing theoretical
works have largely focused on the uniform rate matrices case. Notably,
convergence guarantees and error analyses for absorbing diffusion models are
still missing. In this work, we provide the first finite-time error bounds and
convergence rate analysis for discrete diffusion models using absorbing rate
matrices. We begin by deriving an upper bound on the KL divergence of the
forward process, introducing a surrogate initialization distribution to address
the challenge posed by the absorbing stationary distribution, which is a
singleton and causes the KL divergence to be ill-defined. We then establish the
first convergence guarantees for both the $\tau$-leaping and uniformization
samplers under absorbing rate matrices, demonstrating improved rates over their
counterparts using uniform rate matrices. Furthermore, under suitable
assumptions, we provide convergence guarantees without early stopping. Our
analysis introduces several new technical tools to address challenges unique to
absorbing rate matrices. These include a Jensen-type argument for bounding
forward process convergence, novel techniques for bounding absorbing score
functions, and a non-divergent upper bound on the score near initialization
that removes the need of early-stopping.

Abstract: We formulate an optimization problem to estimate probability densities in the
context of multidimensional problems that are sampled with uneven probability.
It considers detector sensitivity as an heterogeneous density and takes
advantage of the computational speed and flexible boundary conditions offered
by splines on a grid. We choose to regularize the Hessian of the spline via the
nuclear norm to promote sparsity. As a result, the method is spatially adaptive
and stable against the choice of the regularization parameter, which plays the
role of the bandwidth. We test our computational pipeline on standard densities
and provide software. We also present a new approach to PET rebinning as an
application of our framework.

Abstract: Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps enable the coupling of multiphysics simulations
across computational subdomains by ensuring continuity of state variables and
fluxes at artificial interfaces. We present a novel method for learning
Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps on graphs using Gaussian processes, specifically for
problems where the data obey a conservation constraint from an underlying
partial differential equation. Our approach combines discrete exterior calculus
and nonlinear optimal recovery to infer relationships between vertex and edge
values. This framework yields data-driven predictions with uncertainty
quantification across the entire graph, even when observations are limited to a
subset of vertices and edges. By optimizing over the reproducing kernel Hilbert
space norm while applying a maximum likelihood estimation penalty on kernel
complexity, our method ensures that the resulting surrogate strictly enforces
conservation laws without overfitting. We demonstrate our method on two
representative applications: subsurface fracture networks and arterial blood
flow. Our results show that the method maintains high accuracy and
well-calibrated uncertainty estimates even under severe data scarcity,
highlighting its potential for scientific applications where limited data and
reliable uncertainty quantification are critical.

Result: 实验表明，新方法显著提升了pass@N性能，样本多样性增加，并在Lean上取得了与现有方法竞争的结果。

Conclusion: 提出的改进方法简单有效，为RL训练定理证明器提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as an effective framework for training
large language models on structured language-conditioned tasks. We identify a
critical flaw of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a widely used RL
algorithm in this setting. For tasks that require multi-sample performance,
such as formal theorem proving, GRPO biasedly reinforces already probable
solutions and neglects rare but correct proofs. This implicit bias impairs
performance on pass@$N$ metrics at large sample sizes, limiting its
practicality for training theorem provers. To address this, we introduce the
unlikeliness reward, a straightforward method that explicitly encourages
reinforcing rare correct solutions. Additionally, we find that increasing the
number of PPO epochs further mitigates this bias. Our experiments confirm that
incorporating the unlikeliness reward significantly improves pass@$N$ across a
large range of N, outperforming standard GRPO and substantially increasing
sample diversity. Applying our revised recipe to Lean, we achieve competitive
performance with DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5-RL on the miniF2F-test benchmark. We
release our implementation, providing a simple yet effective recipe for
training formal theorem provers with RL.

Motivation: 为确保高级AI开发中的安全性，需要验证代理行为并早期发现控制缺陷，尤其是在安全原则与操作目标冲突时。

Result: 初步研究表明该方法可行，并提供了代理在原则冲突下的行为洞察，为评估可控性提供了实证依据。

Conclusion: 评估代理对分层原则的遵守是理解构建可治理AI系统能力的关键早期步骤。

Abstract: Credible safety plans for advanced AI development require methods to verify
agent behavior and detect potential control deficiencies early. A fundamental
aspect is ensuring agents adhere to safety-critical principles, especially when
these conflict with operational goals. Failure to prioritize such principles
indicates a potential basic control failure. This paper introduces a
lightweight, interpretable benchmark methodology using a simple grid world to
evaluate an LLM agent's ability to uphold a predefined, high-level safety
principle (e.g., "never enter hazardous zones") when faced with conflicting
lower-level task instructions. We probe whether the agent reliably prioritizes
the inviolable directive, testing a foundational controllability aspect of
LLMs. This pilot study demonstrates the methodology's feasibility, offers
preliminary insights into agent behavior under principle conflict, and
discusses how such benchmarks can contribute empirical evidence for assessing
controllability. We argue that evaluating adherence to hierarchical principles
is a crucial early step in understanding our capacity to build governable AI
systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为HiSo的联邦学习方法，通过Hessian-informed零阶优化和标量通信，显著提升了联邦学习中大型语言模型（LLM）微调的收敛速度和通信效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的零阶随机梯度下降（ZO-SGD）方法在联邦学习中通信效率高，但梯度估计的高方差导致收敛速度慢。利用Hessian信息可以加速优化，但如何在保持维度无关通信的同时集成Hessian信息是一个挑战。

Method: 论文首先提出了一种广义的标量通信框架，将维度无关通信与ZO-SGD解耦，从而支持更高级的优化策略。在此基础上，提出了HiSo方法，利用全局曲率信息加速收敛，同时保持每轮通信成本最低。

Result: 理论分析表明，HiSo的收敛速度不受全局Lipschitz常数的限制，且在全局Hessian低有效秩的情况下收敛更快。实验验证了HiSo在收敛速度和通信效率上优于现有基于ZO的联邦学习方法。

Conclusion: HiSo方法通过结合Hessian信息和标量通信，显著提升了联邦学习中LLM微调的效率和性能，为高维模型的联邦优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent dimension-free communication frameworks in Federated Learning (FL),
such as DeComFL, significantly reduce per-round communication by transmitting
only scalars via zeroth-order stochastic gradient descent (ZO-SGD). This method
is particularly advantageous for federated fine-tuning of Large Language Models
(LLMs). Yet, the high variance in ZO gradient estimation typically leads to
slow convergence. Although leveraging Hessian information is known to enhance
optimization speed, integrating this into FL presents significant challenges.
These include clients' restrictions on local data and the critical need to
maintain the dimension-free communication property. To overcome this
limitation, we first introduce a generalized scalar-only communication FL
framework that decouples dimension-free communication from standard ZO-SGD,
enabling the integration of more advanced optimization strategies. Building on
this framework, we propose HiSo, a fast federated fine-tuning method via
Hessian-informed zeroth-order optimization and Scalar-only communication.
Specifically, it leverages global curvature information to accelerate
convergence while preserving the same minimal communication cost per round.
Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees that are independent of the
global Lipschitz constant, and further show that HiSo achieves faster rates
when the global Hessian exhibits a low effective rank -- a common phenomenon in
LLMs. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and LLM fine-tuning tasks
confirm that HiSo significantly outperforms existing ZO-based FL methods in
both convergence speed and communication efficiency.

Motivation: 扩散模型在生成性能上表现优异，但存在数据隐私问题，且SFBD方法需要手动协调，操作复杂。

Method: 将SFBD重新解释为交替投影算法，并引入连续变体SFBD flow，消除交替步骤。

Result: SFBD flow的实例Online SFBD在多个基准测试中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SFBD flow通过连续化改进SFBD，简化实现并提升性能，适用于隐私敏感场景。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve strong generative performance but often rely on
large datasets that may include sensitive content. This challenge is compounded
by the models' tendency to memorize training data, raising privacy concerns.
SFBD (Lu et al., 2025) addresses this by training on corrupted data and using
limited clean samples to capture local structure and improve convergence.
However, its iterative denoising and fine-tuning loop requires manual
coordination, making it burdensome to implement. We reinterpret SFBD as an
alternating projection algorithm and introduce a continuous variant, SFBD flow,
that removes the need for alternating steps. We further show its connection to
consistency constraint-based methods, and demonstrate that its practical
instantiation, Online SFBD, consistently outperforms strong baselines across
benchmarks.

Result: 证明了广泛使用的索引策略具有弱纠缠性，分解误差为亚线性规模，并提供了纠缠度的实用估计方法。

Conclusion: 马尔可夫纠缠为价值分解提供了理论支持，并为实践中的分解质量评估提供了工具。

Abstract: Value decomposition has long been a fundamental technique in multi-agent
dynamic programming and reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, the value
function of a global state $(s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_N)$ is often approximated as the
sum of local functions: $V(s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_N)\approx\sum_{i=1}^N V_i(s_i)$.
This approach traces back to the index policy in restless multi-armed bandit
problems and has found various applications in modern RL systems. However, the
theoretical justification for why this decomposition works so effectively
remains underexplored.
  In this paper, we uncover the underlying mathematical structure that enables
value decomposition. We demonstrate that a multi-agent Markov decision process
(MDP) permits value decomposition if and only if its transition matrix is not
"entangled" -- a concept analogous to quantum entanglement in quantum physics.
Drawing inspiration from how physicists measure quantum entanglement, we
introduce how to measure the "Markov entanglement" for multi-agent MDPs and
show that this measure can be used to bound the decomposition error in general
multi-agent MDPs.
  Using the concept of Markov entanglement, we proved that a widely-used class
of index policies is weakly entangled and enjoys a sublinear $\mathcal
O(\sqrt{N})$ scale of decomposition error for $N$-agent systems. Finally, we
show how Markov entanglement can be efficiently estimated in practice,
providing practitioners with an empirical proxy for the quality of value
decomposition.

Result: 算法在多种复杂度的实例中验证有效，错误概率以理论最优速率衰减，且优于基准算法。

Conclusion: 该算法填补了理论空白，并在实践中表现出色，为固定预算下的最佳臂识别提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The challenge of identifying the best feasible arm within a fixed budget has
attracted considerable interest in recent years. However, a notable gap remains
in the literature: the exact exponential rate at which the error probability
approaches zero has yet to be established, even in the relatively simple
setting of $K$-armed bandits with Gaussian noise. In this paper, we address
this gap by examining the problem within the context of linear bandits. We
introduce a novel algorithm for best feasible arm identification that
guarantees an exponential decay in the error probability. Remarkably, the decay
rate -- characterized by the exponent -- matches the theoretical lower bound
derived using information-theoretic principles. Our approach leverages a
posterior sampling framework embedded within a game-based sampling rule
involving a min-learner and a max-learner. This strategy shares its foundations
with Thompson sampling, but is specifically tailored to optimize the
identification process under fixed-budget constraints. Furthermore, we validate
the effectiveness of our algorithm through comprehensive empirical evaluations
across various problem instances with different levels of complexity. The
results corroborate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method
outperforms several benchmark algorithms in terms of both accuracy and
efficiency.

Abstract: Time-series prediction or forecasting is critical across many real-world
dynamic systems, and recent studies have proposed using Large Language Models
(LLMs) for this task due to their strong generalization capabilities and
ability to perform well without extensive pre-training. However, their
effectiveness in handling complex, noisy, and multivariate time-series data
remains underexplored. To address this, we propose LLMPred which enhances
LLM-based time-series prediction by converting time-series sequences into text
and feeding them to LLMs for zero shot prediction along with two main data
pre-processing techniques. First, we apply time-series sequence decomposition
to facilitate accurate prediction on complex and noisy univariate sequences.
Second, we extend this univariate prediction capability to multivariate data
using a lightweight prompt-processing strategy. Extensive experiments with
smaller LLMs such as Llama 2 7B, Llama 3.2 3B, GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek 7B
demonstrate that LLMPred achieves competitive or superior performance compared
to state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, a thorough ablation study
highlights the importance of the key components proposed in LLMPred.

Conclusion: GAdaBoost成功扩展了AdaBoost和SAMME，为处理标签噪声提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) faces significant challenges posed by label
noise, especially in multiclass classification tasks. Existing methods either
lack mechanisms to handle label noise effectively or suffer from high
computational costs due to redundant data usage. Inspired by granular
computing, this paper proposes granular adaptive boosting (GAdaBoost), a novel
two-stage framework comprising a data granulation stage and an adaptive
boosting stage, to enhance efficiency and robustness under noisy conditions. To
validate its feasibility, an extension of SAMME, termed GAdaBoost.SA, is
proposed. Specifically, first, a granular-ball generation method is designed to
compress data while preserving diversity and mitigating label noise. Second,
the granular ball-based SAMME algorithm focuses on granular balls rather than
individual samples, improving efficiency and reducing sensitivity to noise.
Experimental results on some noisy datasets show that the proposed approach
achieves superior robustness and efficiency compared with existing methods,
demonstrating that this work effectively extends AdaBoost and SAMME.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的学习框架，用于解决神经组合优化（NCO）在小规模训练数据上表现良好但在大规模场景下性能下降的问题。该方法通过投影训练和测试分布之间的映射，无需重新训练模型即可提升NCO模型的可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NCO方法在小规模实例（如100节点）上表现良好，但在大规模场景下性能显著下降，主要原因是训练和测试数据之间的分布偏移。

Method: 引入基于LLM的学习框架，学习训练和测试分布之间的投影，仅需在推理阶段部署，无需重新训练模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法使基于100节点训练的模型在高达100K节点的TSP和CVRP问题上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了NCO在大规模问题中的性能下降问题，且无需重新训练模型，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) has emerged as a promising
learning-based paradigm for addressing Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) by
minimizing the need for extensive manual engineering. While existing NCO
methods, trained on small-scale instances (e.g., 100 nodes), have demonstrated
considerable success on problems of similar scale, their performance
significantly degrades when applied to large-scale scenarios. This degradation
arises from the distributional shift between training and testing data,
rendering policies learned on small instances ineffective for larger problems.
To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel learning framework driven by
Large Language Models (LLMs). This framework learns a projection between the
training and testing distributions, which is then deployed to enhance the
scalability of the NCO model. Notably, unlike prevailing techniques that
necessitate joint training with the neural network, our approach operates
exclusively during the inference phase, obviating the need for model
retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method enables a
backbone model (trained on 100-node instances) to achieve superior performance
on large-scale Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing
Problem (CVRP) of up to 100K nodes from diverse distributions.

Conclusion: 随机傅里叶预处理是一种理论支持、即插即用的表格数据深度学习增强方法。

Abstract: While random Fourier features are a classic tool in kernel methods, their
utility as a pre-processing step for deep learning on tabular data has been
largely overlooked. Motivated by shortcomings in tabular deep learning
pipelines - revealed through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis - we revisit
and repurpose random Fourier mappings as a parameter-free,
architecture-agnostic transformation. By projecting each input into a fixed
feature space via sine and cosine projections with frequencies drawn once at
initialization, this approach circumvents the need for ad hoc normalization or
additional learnable embeddings. We show within the NTK framework that this
mapping (i) bounds and conditions the network's initial NTK spectrum, and (ii)
introduces a bias that shortens the optimization trajectory, thereby
accelerating gradient-based training. These effects pre-condition the network
with a stable kernel from the outset. Empirically, we demonstrate that deep
networks trained on Fourier-transformed inputs converge more rapidly and
consistently achieve strong final performance, often with fewer epochs and less
hyperparameter tuning. Our findings establish random Fourier pre-processing as
a theoretically motivated, plug-and-play enhancement for tabular deep learning.

linear systems, especially under uncertainty. We introduce AERO (Adversarial
Energy-based Redirection Optimization), a novel framework inspired by the
redirection principle in Judo, where external disturbances are leveraged rather
than resisted. AERO reimagines optimization as a redirection process guided by
15 interrelated axioms encompassing adversarial correction, energy
conservation, and disturbance-aware learning. By projecting gradients,
integrating uncertainty driven dynamics, and managing learning energy, AERO
offers a principled approach to stable and robust model updates. Applied to
probabilistic solar energy forecasting, AERO demonstrates substantial gains in
predictive accuracy, reliability, and adaptability, especially in noisy and
uncertain environments. Our findings highlight AERO as a compelling new
direction in the theoretical and practical landscape of optimization.

TL;DR: WSNET是一种弱监督图对比学习框架，利用弱信号提升节点分类性能，在真实和合成数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实图数据中标签稀缺且噪声多，弱信号虽不完美但仍可用于学习。

Method: 结合图结构、节点特征和多噪声监督源，设计针对弱标签数据的对比目标。

Result: 在三个真实数据集和合成基准上，F1分数最高提升15%。

Conclusion: 弱监督下的对比学习有效，利用不完美标签在图数据中具有潜力。

Abstract: Node classification in real world graphs often suffers from label scarcity
and noise, especially in high stakes domains like human trafficking detection
and misinformation monitoring. While direct supervision is limited, such graphs
frequently contain weak signals, noisy or indirect cues, that can still inform
learning. We propose WSNET, a novel weakly supervised graph contrastive
learning framework that leverages these weak signals to guide robust
representation learning. WSNET integrates graph structure, node features, and
multiple noisy supervision sources through a contrastive objective tailored for
weakly labeled data. Across three real world datasets and synthetic benchmarks
with controlled noise, WSNET consistently outperforms state of the art
contrastive and noisy label learning methods by up to 15% in F1 score. Our
results highlight the effectiveness of contrastive learning under weak
supervision and the promise of exploiting imperfect labels in graph based
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的序列建模方法（如Gated DeltaNet、TTT和RWKV-7）通过Delta学习规则改进性能，但存在非线性递归结构的局限性。本文旨在分析这些模型的优缺点，并提出更高效的解决方案。

Method: 基于闭环控制理论，提出Comba模型，采用标量加低秩状态转移，结合状态反馈和输出反馈校正，并实现硬件高效的并行内核。

Result: 在340M/1.3B参数的大规模语料训练中，Comba在语言和视觉建模中表现出优越性能和计算效率。

Conclusion: Comba通过创新的非线性RNN结构和高效实现，为序列建模提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent efficient sequence modeling methods such as Gated DeltaNet, TTT, and
RWKV-7 have achieved performance improvements by supervising the recurrent
memory management through Delta learning rule. Unlike previous state-space
models (e.g., Mamba) and gated linear attentions (e.g., GLA), these models
introduce interactions between the recurrent state and the key vector,
resulting in a nonlinear recursive structure. In this paper, we first introduce
the concept of Nonlinear RNNs with a comprehensive analysis on the advantages
and limitations of these models. Then, based on closed-loop control theory, we
propose a novel Nonlinear RNN variant named Comba, which adopts a
scalar-plus-low-rank state transition, with both state feedback and output
feedback corrections. We also implement a hardware-efficient chunk-wise
parallel kernel in Triton and train models with 340M/1.3B parameters on
large-scale corpus. Comba demonstrates its superior performance and computation
efficiency in both language and vision modeling.

Result: 将迭代复杂度从O(1/ε^6)降至O(1/ε^5)，并在实验中验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为FCCO问题提供了更高效的解决方案，适用于多种约束优化问题。

Abstract: Finite-sum Coupled Compositional Optimization (FCCO), characterized by its
coupled compositional objective structure, emerges as an important optimization
paradigm for addressing a wide range of machine learning problems. In this
paper, we focus on a challenging class of non-convex non-smooth FCCO, where the
outer functions are non-smooth weakly convex or convex and the inner functions
are smooth or weakly convex. Existing state-of-the-art result face two key
limitations: (1) a high iteration complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^6)$ under the
assumption that the stochastic inner functions are Lipschitz continuous in
expectation; (2) reliance on vanilla SGD-type updates, which are not suitable
for deep learning applications. Our main contributions are two fold: (i) We
propose stochastic momentum methods tailored for non-smooth FCCO that come with
provable convergence guarantees; (ii) We establish a new state-of-the-art
iteration complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^5)$. Moreover, we apply our algorithms to
multiple inequality constrained non-convex optimization problems involving
smooth or weakly convex functional inequality constraints. By optimizing a
smoothed hinge penalty based formulation, we achieve a new state-of-the-art
complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^5)$ for finding an (nearly) $\epsilon$-level KKT
solution. Experiments on three tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithms.

Result: 在OSWorld生产力任务中，VerificAgent比基线代理的成功率提高了111.1%。

Conclusion: VerificAgent通过系统化的记忆管理，有效提升了代理的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Continual memory augmentation allows computer-use agents (CUAs) to learn from
past interactions and refine their task-solving strategies over time. However,
unchecked memory accumulation can introduce spurious or hallucinated
"learnings" that degrade agent performance, particularly in domain-specific
workflows such as productivity software. We present a novel framework,
VerificAgent, that effectively manages memory for CUAs through (1) an
expert-curated seed of domain knowledge, (2) iterative, trajectory-based memory
refinement during training, and (3) a post-hoc fact-checking pass by human
experts to sanitize accumulated memory before deployment. On OSWorld
productivity tasks, VerificAgent achieves a 111.1% relative improvement in
success rate over baseline CUA without any additional fine-tuning.

Motivation: 现有遗忘方法在大型视觉语言模型中常因未谨慎选择替代输出而导致副作用，如退化或幻觉响应，需改进以生成更高质量的遗忘后响应。

Method: 提出PUBG方法，明确引导遗忘后的行为朝向理想的输出分布，确保响应既隐私保护又信息丰富且视觉相关。

Result: 实验表明，PUBG有效避免了现有方法的副作用，成功生成视觉相关且信息丰富的响应，同时防止隐私泄露。

Conclusion: PUBG为LVLMs提供了一种有效的遗忘方法，解决了现有技术的局限性，提升了遗忘后的响应质量。

Abstract: Machine unlearning is used to mitigate the privacy risks of Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) arising from training on large-scale web data.
However, existing unlearning methods often fail to carefully select substitute
outputs for forget targets, resulting in Unlearning Aftermaths-undesirable
behaviors such as degenerate, hallucinated, or excessively refused responses.
We highlight that, especially for generative LVLMs, it is crucial to consider
the quality and informativeness of post-unlearning responses rather than
relying solely on naive suppression. To address this, we introduce a new
unlearning task for LVLMs that requires models to provide privacy-preserving
yet informative and visually grounded responses. We also propose PUBG, a novel
unlearning method that explicitly guides post-unlearning behavior toward a
desirable output distribution. Experiments show that, while existing methods
suffer from Unlearning Aftermaths despite successfully preventing privacy
violations, PUBG effectively mitigates these issues, generating visually
grounded and informative responses without privacy leakage for forgotten
targets.

Conclusion: HIEGNet通过整合免疫环境信息，显著提升了肾小球分类性能，为肾病病理学提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been found to excel in
histopathology. However, an important histopathological task, where GNNs have
not been extensively explored, is the classification of glomeruli health as an
important indicator in nephropathology. This task presents unique difficulties,
particularly for the graph construction, i.e., the identification of nodes,
edges, and informative features. In this work, we propose a pipeline composed
of different traditional and machine learning-based computer vision techniques
to identify nodes, edges, and their corresponding features to form a
heterogeneous graph. We then proceed to propose a novel heterogeneous GNN
architecture for glomeruli classification, called HIEGNet, that integrates both
glomeruli and their surrounding immune cells. Hence, HIEGNet is able to
consider the immune environment of each glomerulus in its classification. Our
HIEGNet was trained and tested on a dataset of Whole Slide Images from kidney
transplant patients. Experimental results demonstrate that HIEGNet outperforms
several baseline models and generalises best between patients among all
baseline models. Our implementation is publicly available at
https://github.com/nklsKrmnn/HIEGNet.git.

Conclusion: 响应级奖励方法具有理论可行性，TRePO为LLM微调提供了更简单高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study a common challenge in reinforcement learning for large language
models (LLMs): the Zero-Reward Assumption, where non-terminal actions (i.e.,
intermediate token generations) receive zero task-specific immediate reward,
while only the final token receives a reward for the entire response. This
assumption arises frequently in practice, as precise token-level rewards are
often difficult or infeasible to obtain in LLM applications. In this work, we
provide a unifying theoretical perspective. We introduce the Trajectory Policy
Gradient Theorem, which shows that the policy gradient based on true, unknown
token-level rewards can be unbiasedly estimated using only a response-level
reward model, regardless of whether the Zero-Reward Assumption holds or not,
for algorithms in the REINFORCE and Actor-Critic families. This result reveals
that widely used methods such as PPO, GRPO, ReMax, and RLOO inherently possess
the capacity to model token-level reward signals, offering a theoretical
justification for response-level reward approaches. Our findings pave the way
for more practical, efficient LLM fine-tuning, allowing developers to treat
training algorithms as black boxes and focus on improving the response-level
reward model with auxiliary sub-models. We also offer a detailed analysis of
popular RL and non-RL methods, comparing their theoretical foundations and
practical advantages across common LLM tasks. Finally, we propose a new
algorithm: Token-Reinforced Policy Optimization (TRePO), a theoretically
grounded method that is simpler than PPO, matches GRPO in memory efficiency,
and holds promise for broad applicability.

Result: 该方法在均匀和非均匀数据分布下均能实现最优性能。

Conclusion: 扩展了差分隐私在联邦学习中的应用，为部分参与的分布式系统提供了高效且实用的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of achieving Differential Privacy (DP) in
Federated Learning (FL) under partial-participation, where only a subset of the
machines participate in each time-step. While previous work achieved optimal
performance in full-participation settings, these methods struggled to extend
to partial-participation scenarios. Our approach fills this gap by introducing
a novel noise-cancellation mechanism that preserves privacy without sacrificing
convergence rates or computational efficiency. We analyze our method within the
Stochastic Convex Optimization (SCO) framework and show that it delivers
optimal performance for both homogeneous and heterogeneous data distributions.
This work expands the applicability of DP in FL, offering an efficient and
practical solution for privacy-preserving learning in distributed systems with
partial participation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Top-k注意力机制在效率和准确性之间难以平衡，HATA旨在通过哈希技术低成本实现相对qk分数排序。

Method: HATA将查询和键映射为二进制哈希码，以低成本获取相对qk分数顺序，实现Top-k注意力。

Result: 实验表明，HATA比全注意力快7.2倍，并在多个LLM模型和任务中优于现有Top-k方法。

Conclusion: HATA在保持模型精度的同时显著提升效率，是LLM推理的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a pivotal research area, yet the
attention module remains a critical bottleneck in LLM inference, even with
techniques like KVCache to mitigate redundant computations. While various
top-$k$ attention mechanisms have been proposed to accelerate LLM inference by
exploiting the inherent sparsity of attention, they often struggled to strike a
balance between efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce HATA
(Hash-Aware Top-$k$ Attention), a novel approach that systematically integrates
low-overhead learning-to-hash techniques into the Top-$k$ attention process.
Different from the existing top-k attention methods which are devoted to
seeking an absolute estimation of qk score, typically with a great cost, HATA
maps queries and keys into binary hash codes, and acquires the relative qk
score order with a quite low cost, which is sufficient for realizing top-k
attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HATA achieves up to
7.2$\times$ speedup compared to vanilla full attention while maintaining model
accuracy. In addition, HATA outperforms the state-of-the-art top-$k$ attention
methods in both accuracy and efficiency across multiple mainstream LLM models
and diverse tasks. HATA is open source at https://github.com/gpzlx1/HATA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线目标条件强化学习中，均匀采样会导致大量不可达的状态-目标-动作对，降低策略性能。因此，需要一种更高效的采样方法。

Method: 提出RWS方法，利用可达性分类器（基于PU学习）为状态-动作对打分，优先采样可达性高的对。RWS可无缝集成到现有离线强化学习算法中。

Result: 在六个复杂机器人操控任务中，RWS显著提升了性能，其中HandBlock-Z任务的性能提升了近50%。

Conclusion: RWS通过优化采样策略，有效提升了离线目标条件强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) relies on fixed datasets
where many potential goals share the same state and action spaces. However,
these potential goals are not explicitly represented in the collected
trajectories. To learn a generalizable goal-conditioned policy, it is common to
sample goals and state-action pairs uniformly using dynamic programming methods
such as Q-learning. Uniform sampling, however, requires an intractably large
dataset to cover all possible combinations and creates many unreachable
state-goal-action pairs that degrade policy performance. Our key insight is
that sampling should favor transitions that enable goal achievement. To this
end, we propose Reachability Weighted Sampling (RWS). RWS uses a reachability
classifier trained via positive-unlabeled (PU) learning on goal-conditioned
state-action values. The classifier maps these values to a reachability score,
which is then used as a sampling priority. RWS is a plug-and-play module that
integrates seamlessly with standard offline RL algorithms. Experiments on six
complex simulated robotic manipulation tasks, including those with a robot arm
and a dexterous hand, show that RWS significantly improves performance. In one
notable case, performance on the HandBlock-Z task improved by nearly 50 percent
relative to the baseline. These results indicate the effectiveness of
reachability-weighted sampling.

Abstract: The ability to operate safely in increasingly complex traffic scenarios is a
fundamental requirement for Automated Driving Systems (ADS). Ensuring the safe
release of ADS functions necessitates a precise understanding of the occurring
traffic scenarios. To support this objective, this work introduces a pipeline
for traffic scenario clustering and the analysis of scenario category
completeness. The Clustering Vector Quantized - Variational Autoencoder
(CVQ-VAE) is employed for the clustering of highway traffic scenarios and
utilized to create various catalogs with differing numbers of traffic scenario
categories. Subsequently, the impact of the number of categories on the
completeness considerations of the traffic scenario categories is analyzed. The
results show an outperforming clustering performance compared to previous work.
The trade-off between cluster quality and the amount of required data to
maintain completeness is discussed based on the publicly available highD
dataset.

Result: 在四个真实数据集上，HGOT在节点分类任务中平均准确率提升超过6%。

Conclusion: HGOT通过最优传输机制有效学习高质量节点表示，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs), have demonstrated excellent
capabilities in processing heterogeneous information networks. Self-supervised
learning on heterogeneous graphs, especially contrastive self-supervised
strategy, shows great potential when there are no labels. However, this
approach requires the use of carefully designed graph augmentation strategies
and the selection of positive and negative samples. Determining the exact level
of similarity between sample pairs is non-trivial.To solve this problem, we
propose a novel self-supervised Heterogeneous graph neural network with Optimal
Transport (HGOT) method which is designed to facilitate self-supervised
learning for heterogeneous graphs without graph augmentation strategies.
Different from traditional contrastive self-supervised learning, HGOT employs
the optimal transport mechanism to relieve the laborious sampling process of
positive and negative samples. Specifically, we design an aggregating view
(central view) to integrate the semantic information contained in the views
represented by different meta-paths (branch views). Then, we introduce an
optimal transport plan to identify the transport relationship between the
semantics contained in the branch view and the central view. This allows the
optimal transport plan between graphs to align with the representations,
forcing the encoder to learn node representations that are more similar to the
graph space and of higher quality. Extensive experiments on four real-world
datasets demonstrate that our proposed HGOT model can achieve state-of-the-art
performance on various downstream tasks. In particular, in the node
classification task, HGOT achieves an average of more than 6% improvement in
accuracy compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现代NAS是多目标的，平衡准确性、参数数量和计算成本等权衡，但计算昂贵且难以高效解决。

Method: 利用Siamese网络块集成预测架构优势关系，替代拥挤距离计算，并集成到SiamNAS框架中。

Result: 在NAS-Bench-201上，SiamNAS以0.01 GPU天找到Pareto最优解，CIFAR-10和ImageNet上表现优异。

Conclusion: Siamese代理模型在多任务优化中潜力显著，可扩展为生成Pareto解集（SOS）。

Abstract: Modern neural architecture search (NAS) is inherently multi-objective,
balancing trade-offs such as accuracy, parameter count, and computational cost.
This complexity makes NAS computationally expensive and nearly impossible to
solve without efficient approximations. To address this, we propose a novel
surrogate modelling approach that leverages an ensemble of Siamese network
blocks to predict dominance relationships between candidate architectures.
Lightweight and easy to train, the surrogate achieves 92% accuracy and replaces
the crowding distance calculation in the survivor selection strategy with a
heuristic rule based on model size. Integrated into a framework termed SiamNAS,
this design eliminates costly evaluations during the search process.
Experiments on NAS-Bench-201 demonstrate the framework's ability to identify
Pareto-optimal solutions with significantly reduced computational costs. The
proposed SiamNAS identified a final non-dominated set containing the best
architecture in NAS-Bench-201 for CIFAR-10 and the second-best for ImageNet, in
terms of test error rate, within 0.01 GPU days. This proof-of-concept study
highlights the potential of the proposed Siamese network surrogate model to
generalise to multi-tasking optimisation, enabling simultaneous optimisation
across tasks. Additionally, it offers opportunities to extend the approach for
generating Sets of Pareto Sets (SOS), providing diverse Pareto-optimal
solutions for heterogeneous task settings.

Conclusion: HAM计算开销低，适用于小批量训练，并能无缝集成现有优化器，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Understanding the implicit bias of optimization algorithms has become central
to explaining the generalization behavior of deep learning models. For
instance, the hyperbolic implicit bias induced by the overparameterization $m
\odot w$--though effective in promoting sparsity--can result in a small
effective learning rate, which slows down convergence. To overcome this
obstacle, we propose HAM (Hyperbolic Aware Minimization), which alternates
between an optimizer step and a new hyperbolic mirror step. We derive the
Riemannian gradient flow for its combination with gradient descent, leading to
improved convergence and a similar beneficial hyperbolic geometry as $m \odot
w$ for feature learning. We provide an interpretation of the the algorithm by
relating it to natural gradient descent, and an exact characterization of its
implicit bias for underdetermined linear regression. HAM's implicit bias
consistently boosts performance--even of dense training, as we demonstrate in
experiments across diverse tasks, including vision, graph and node
classification, and large language model fine-tuning. HAM is especially
effective in combination with different sparsification methods, improving upon
the state of the art. The hyperbolic step requires minimal computational and
memory overhead, it succeeds even with small batch sizes, and its
implementation integrates smoothly with existing optimizers.

TL;DR: TrafficPPT是一个预训练的概率Transformer模型，用于预测城市交通流量，解决了现有方法忽略不确定性和泛化能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市交通流量预测在智能交通系统中至关重要，但现有方法存在数据不完整、偏差以及忽略不确定性的问题。

Method: TrafficPPT融合实时观测、历史轨迹和路网拓扑数据，通过预训练和微调实现跨城市泛化。

Result: 实验表明，TrafficPPT在极端数据稀疏条件下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TrafficPPT为不确定性感知的交通预测提供了有效解决方案，并具备跨城市适用性。

Abstract: City-scale traffic volume prediction plays a pivotal role in intelligent
transportation systems, yet remains a challenge due to the inherent
incompleteness and bias in observational data. Although deep learning-based
methods have shown considerable promise, most existing approaches produce
deterministic point estimates, thereby neglecting the uncertainty arising from
unobserved traffic flows. Furthermore, current models are typically trained in
a city-specific manner, which hinders their generalizability and limits
scalability across diverse urban contexts. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce TrafficPPT, a Pretrained Probabilistic Transformer designed to model
traffic volume as a distributional aggregation of trajectories. Our framework
fuses heterogeneous data sources-including real-time observations, historical
trajectory data, and road network topology-enabling robust and
uncertainty-aware traffic inference. TrafficPPT is initially pretrained on
large-scale simulated data spanning multiple urban scenarios, and later
fine-tuned on target cities to ensure effective domain adaptation. Experiments
on real-world datasets show that TrafficPPT consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art baselines, particularly under conditions of extreme data
sparsity. Code will be open.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI技术的发展，版权内容面临未经授权使用的风险增加，现有方法仅提供短期保护且需频繁更新。

Method: 提出了一种基于概率和逆问题的新框架，嵌入难以去除的可见水印，并通过近似算法解决双层优化问题。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法在多种场景下表现优越。

Conclusion: 该方法为版权保护提供了长期有效的解决方案。

Abstract: As AI advances, copyrighted content faces growing risk of unauthorized use,
whether through model training or direct misuse. Building upon invisible
adversarial perturbation, recent works developed copyright protections against
specific AI techniques such as unauthorized personalization through DreamBooth
that are misused. However, these methods offer only short-term security, as
they require retraining whenever the underlying model architectures change. To
establish long-term protection aiming at better robustness, we go beyond
invisible perturbation, and propose a universal approach that embeds
\textit{visible} watermarks that are \textit{hard-to-remove} into images.
Grounded in a new probabilistic and inverse problem-based formulation, our
framework maximizes the discrepancy between the \textit{optimal} reconstruction
and the original content. We develop an effective and efficient approximation
algorithm to circumvent a intractable bi-level optimization. Experimental
results demonstrate superiority of our approach across diverse scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Chatterjee秩相关系数的新型注意力机制XicorAttention，用于改进时间序列预测中的非线性依赖捕捉，实验显示预测精度提升约9.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有注意力机制在捕捉时间序列数据的非线性依赖方面不足，需要改进。

Method: 用Chatterjee秩相关系数替代标准注意力机制中的矩阵乘法，并引入可微分的SoftSort和SoftRank近似。

Result: 在真实数据集上，XicorAttention将预测精度提升约9.1%。

Conclusion: XicorAttention通过引入非线性相关性显著提升了时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: Various Transformer-based models have been proposed for time series
forecasting. These models leverage the self-attention mechanism to capture
long-term temporal or variate dependencies in sequences. Existing methods can
be divided into two approaches: (1) reducing computational cost of attention by
making the calculations sparse, and (2) reshaping the input data to aggregate
temporal features. However, existing attention mechanisms may not adequately
capture inherent nonlinear dependencies present in time series data, leaving
room for improvement. In this study, we propose a novel attention mechanism
based on Chatterjee's rank correlation coefficient, which measures nonlinear
dependencies between variables. Specifically, we replace the matrix
multiplication in standard attention mechanisms with this rank coefficient to
measure the query-key relationship. Since computing Chatterjee's correlation
coefficient involves sorting and ranking operations, we introduce a
differentiable approximation employing SoftSort and SoftRank. Our proposed
mechanism, ``XicorAttention,'' integrates it into several state-of-the-art
Transformer models. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate
that incorporating nonlinear correlation into the attention improves
forecasting accuracy by up to approximately 9.1\% compared to existing models.

Motivation: 揭示当前信用卡欺诈检测研究中普遍存在的方法论问题，强调评估严谨性比模型复杂性更重要。

Method: 通过故意使用不正确的评估协议进行实验，识别了四种关键问题：数据泄漏、方法报告模糊、时间验证不足和指标操纵。

Result: 案例研究表明，即使存在数据泄漏的简单神经网络也能在召回率上优于复杂方法，达到99.9%。

Conclusion: 方法论严谨性应优先于架构复杂性，这对改进机器学习研究实践具有重要意义。

Abstract: This study critically examines the methodological rigor in credit card fraud
detection research, revealing how fundamental evaluation flaws can overshadow
algorithmic sophistication. Through deliberate experimentation with improper
evaluation protocols, we demonstrate that even simple models can achieve
deceptively impressive results when basic methodological principles are
violated. Our analysis identifies four critical issues plaguing current
approaches: (1) pervasive data leakage from improper preprocessing sequences,
(2) intentional vagueness in methodological reporting, (3) inadequate temporal
validation for transaction data, and (4) metric manipulation through recall
optimization at precision's expense. We present a case study showing how a
minimal neural network architecture with data leakage outperforms many
sophisticated methods reported in literature, achieving 99.9\% recall despite
fundamental evaluation flaws. These findings underscore that proper evaluation
methodology matters more than model complexity in fraud detection research. The
study serves as a cautionary example of how methodological rigor must precede
architectural sophistication, with implications for improving research
practices across machine learning applications.

Method: 基于部分最优传输推导PDA的泛化界，提出部分Wasserstein距离作为域对齐项，设计理论驱动的权重表达式。

Result: 实验表明WARMPOT算法与现有方法竞争，且提出的权重优于启发式方案。

Conclusion: 理论框架为PDA提供了基础，WARMPOT算法和权重设计具有实际优势。

Abstract: In many scenarios of practical interest, labeled data from a target
distribution are scarce while labeled data from a related source distribution
are abundant. One particular setting of interest arises when the target label
space is a subset of the source label space, leading to the framework of
partial domain adaptation (PDA). Typical approaches to PDA involve minimizing a
domain alignment term and a weighted empirical loss on the source data, with
the aim of transferring knowledge between domains. However, a theoretical basis
for this procedure is lacking, and in particular, most existing weighting
schemes are heuristic. In this work, we derive generalization bounds for the
PDA problem based on partial optimal transport. These bounds corroborate the
use of the partial Wasserstein distance as a domain alignment term, and lead to
theoretically motivated explicit expressions for the empirical source loss
weights. Inspired by these bounds, we devise a practical algorithm for PDA,
termed WARMPOT. Through extensive numerical experiments, we show that WARMPOT
is competitive with recent approaches, and that our proposed weights improve on
existing schemes.

Result: 实验表明，MHGPO在多智能体LLM搜索系统中优于MAPPO，任务性能和计算效率均有提升。

Conclusion: MHGPO为复杂LLM多智能体系统提供了一种稳定且可扩展的优化方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
natural language processing tasks, yet their deployment in real-world
applications is hindered by fixed knowledge cutoffs and difficulties in
generating controllable, accurate outputs in a single inference. Multi-agent
systems (MAS) built from specialized LLM agents offer a promising solution,
enabling dynamic collaboration and iterative reasoning. However, optimizing
these systems remains a challenge, as conventional methods such as prompt
engineering and supervised fine-tuning entail high engineering overhead and
limited adaptability. Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL), provides a scalable framework by refining agent
policies based on system-level feedback. Nevertheless, existing MARL
algorithms, such as Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO), rely on
Critic networks, which can cause training instability and increase
computational burden. To address these limitations and target the prototypical
Multi-Agent Search System (MASS), we propose Multi-Agent Heterogeneous Group
Policy Optimization (MHGPO), a novel Critic-free algorithm that guides policy
updates by estimating relative reward advantages across heterogeneous groups of
rollouts. MHGPO eliminates the need for Critic networks, enhancing stability
and reducing computational overhead. Additionally, we introduce three group
rollout sampling strategies that trade off between efficiency and
effectiveness. Experiments on a multi-agent LLM-based search system demonstrate
that MHGPO consistently outperforms MAPPO in both task performance and
computational efficiency, without requiring warm-up, underscoring its potential
for stable and scalable optimization of complex LLM-based MAS.

Result: 实验表明WeightLoRA显著减少参数且性能优于其他自适应方法。

Conclusion: WeightLoRA及其改进版WeightLoRA+在多种模型和基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: The widespread utilization of language models in modern applications is
inconceivable without Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques, such as
low-rank adaptation ($\texttt{LoRA}$), which adds trainable adapters to
selected layers. Although $\texttt{LoRA}$ may obtain accurate solutions, it
requires significant memory to train large models and intuition on which layers
to add adapters. In this paper, we propose a novel method,
$\texttt{WeightLoRA}$, which overcomes this issue by adaptive selection of the
most critical $\texttt{LoRA}$ heads throughout the optimization process. As a
result, we can significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters while
maintaining the capability to obtain consistent or even superior metric values.
We conduct experiments for a series of competitive benchmarks and DeBERTa,
BART, and Llama models, comparing our method with different adaptive
approaches. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of
$\texttt{WeightLoRA}$ and the superior performance of $\texttt{WeightLoRA+}$ in
almost all cases.

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) can be framed as a 3-order binary tensor
completion task. Tensor decomposition-based (TDB) models have demonstrated
strong performance in KGC. In this paper, we provide a summary of existing TDB
models and derive a general form for them, serving as a foundation for further
exploration of TDB models. Despite the expressiveness of TDB models, they are
prone to overfitting. Existing regularization methods merely minimize the norms
of embeddings to regularize the model, leading to suboptimal performance.
Therefore, we propose a novel regularization method for TDB models that
addresses this limitation. The regularization is applicable to most TDB models
and ensures tractable computation. Our method minimizes the norms of
intermediate variables involved in the different ways of computing the
predicted tensor. To support our regularization method, we provide a
theoretical analysis that proves its effect in promoting low trace norm of the
predicted tensor to reduce overfitting. Finally, we conduct experiments to
verify the effectiveness of our regularization technique as well as the
reliability of our theoretical analysis. The code is available at

Abstract: Tabular anomaly detection, which aims at identifying deviant samples, has
been crucial in a variety of real-world applications, such as medical disease
identification, financial fraud detection, intrusion monitoring, etc. Although
recent deep learning-based methods have achieved competitive performances,
these methods suffer from representation entanglement and the lack of global
correlation modeling, which hinders anomaly detection performance. To tackle
the problem, we incorporate mask modeling and prototype learning into tabular
anomaly detection. The core idea is to design learnable masks by disentangled
representation learning within a projection space and extracting normal
dependencies as explicit global prototypes. Specifically, the overall model
involves two parts: (i) During encoding, we perform mask modeling in both the
data space and projection space with orthogonal basis vectors for learning
shared disentangled normal patterns; (ii) During decoding, we decode multiple
masked representations in parallel for reconstruction and learn association
prototypes to extract normal characteristic correlations. Our proposal derives
from a distribution-matching perspective, where both projection space learning
and association prototype learning are formulated as optimal transport
problems, and the calibration distances are utilized to refine the anomaly
scores. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on 20 tabular benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our model.

Abstract: This paper addresses the slow policy optimization convergence of Monte Carlo
Probabilistic Inference for Learning Control (MC-PILCO), a state-of-the-art

iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR), a fast trajectory optimization
method suitable for nonlinear systems. The proposed method, Exploration-Boosted
MC-PILCO (EB-MC-PILCO), leverages iLQR to generate informative, exploratory

EB-MC-PILCO accelerates convergence compared to standard MC-PILCO, achieving up
to $\bm{45.9\%}$ reduction in execution time when both methods solve the task
in four trials. EB-MC-PILCO also maintains a $\bm{100\%}$ success rate across

Conclusion: 该方法是一种透明、可扩展的数据级策略，适用于不平衡领域的回归模型改进。

Abstract: Handling imbalanced target distributions in regression tasks remains a
significant challenge in tabular data settings where underrepresented regions
can hinder model performance. Among data-level solutions, some proposals, such
as random sampling and SMOTE-based approaches, propose adapting classification
techniques to regression tasks. However, these methods typically rely on crisp,
artificial thresholds over the target variable, a limitation inherited from
classification settings that can introduce arbitrariness, often leading to
non-intuitive and potentially misleading problem formulations. While recent
generative models, such as GANs and VAEs, provide flexible sample synthesis,
they come with high computational costs and limited interpretability. In this
study, we propose adapting an existing CART-based synthetic data generation
method, tailoring it for imbalanced regression. The new method integrates
relevance and density-based mechanisms to guide sampling in sparse regions of
the target space and employs a threshold-free, feature-driven generation
process. Our experimental study focuses on the prediction of extreme target
values across benchmark datasets. The results indicate that the proposed method
is competitive with other resampling and generative strategies in terms of
performance, while offering faster execution and greater transparency. These
results highlight the method's potential as a transparent, scalable data-level
strategy for improving regression models in imbalanced domains.

Conclusion: DSNN通过引入方向性信息，显著提升了SNN的性能，为复杂关系数据建模提供了新工具。

Abstract: Sheaf Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a powerful generalization of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) that significantly improve our ability to model complex
relational data. While directionality has been shown to substantially boost
performance in graph learning tasks and is key to many real-world applications,
existing SNNs fall short in representing it. To address this limitation, we
introduce the Directed Cellular Sheaf, a special type of cellular sheaf
designed to explicitly account for edge orientation. Building on this
structure, we define a new sheaf Laplacian, the Directed Sheaf Laplacian, which
captures both the graph's topology and its directional information. This
operator serves as the backbone of the Directed Sheaf Neural Network (DSNN),
the first SNN model to embed a directional bias into its architecture.
Extensive experiments on nine real-world benchmarks show that DSNN consistently
outperforms baseline methods.

Result: 理论分析表明BNPO能降低方差，实验证明其在推理任务上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: BNPO通过动态归一化奖励，显著提升了训练稳定性与性能，适用于复杂奖励系统。

Abstract: Recent studies, including DeepSeek-R1 and Kimi-k1.5, have demonstrated that
reinforcement learning with rule-based, binary-valued reward functions can
significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models.
These models primarily utilize REINFORCE-based policy optimization techniques,
such as REINFORCE with baseline and group relative policy optimization (GRPO).
However, a key limitation remains: current policy optimization methods either
neglect reward normalization or employ static normalization strategies, which
fail to adapt to the dynamic nature of policy updates during training. This may
result in unstable gradient estimates and hinder training stability. To address
this issue, we propose Beta Normalization Policy Optimization (BNPO), a novel
policy optimization method that adaptively normalizes rewards using a Beta
distribution with dynamically updated parameters. BNPO aligns the normalization
with the changing policy distribution, enabling more precise and lower-variance
gradient estimation, which in turn promotes stable training dynamics. We
provide theoretical analysis demonstrating BNPO's variance-reducing properties
and show that it generalizes both REINFORCE and GRPO under binary-valued reward
settings. Furthermore, we introduce an advantage decomposition mechanism to
extend BNPO's applicability to more complex reward systems. Experimental
results confirm that BNPO achieves state-of-the-art performance among policy
optimization methods on reasoning tasks. The code is available at

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a learning mechanism that falls under the
distributed training umbrella, which collaboratively trains a shared global
model without disclosing the raw data from different clients. This paper
presents an extensive survey on the impact of partial client participation in
federated learning. While much of the existing research focuses on addressing

heterogeneity under the assumption of full client participation, limited
attention has been given to the practical and theoretical challenges arising
from partial client participation, which is common in real-world scenarios.
This survey provides an in-depth review of existing FL methods designed to cope
with partial client participation. We offer a comprehensive analysis supported
by theoretical insights and empirical findings, along with a structured

Conclusion: 细粒度MoE为未来大规模模型开发提供了有效的实践依据。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as pivotal for scaling
Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently. Fine-grained MoE approaches -
utilizing more numerous, smaller experts - have demonstrated potential in
improving model convergence and quality. This work proposes a set of training
recipes and provides a comprehensive empirical evaluation of fine-grained MoE,
directly comparing its scaling properties against standard MoE configurations
for models with up to 56B total (17B active) parameters. We investigate
convergence speed, model performance on downstream benchmarks, and practical
training considerations across various setups. Overall, at the largest scale we
show that fine-grained MoE achieves better validation loss and higher accuracy
across a set of downstream benchmarks. This study offers empirical grounding
and practical insights for leveraging fine-grained MoE in the development of
future large-scale models.

<details>

Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端数据异构性会严重降低模型性能，需要一种新方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 采用基于意见动态的方法，动态组织客户端为非重叠聚类，并从每个聚类中选择一个客户端以减少模型更新的方差。

Result: 在异构场景下，算法表现优于现有联邦学习方法，提供更准确的结果和更快收敛。

Conclusion: FCVR-BE算法通过动态聚类和方差减少选择，有效提升了联邦学习在数据异构环境中的性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative model
training, yet its practical strength is often undermined by client data
heterogeneity, which severely degrades model performance. This paper proposes
that data heterogeneity across clients' distributions can be effectively
addressed by adopting an approach inspired by opinion dynamics over temporal
social networks. We introduce \shortname (Federated Coalition Variance
Reduction with Boltzmann Exploration), a variance-reducing selection algorithm
in which (1) clients dynamically organize into non-overlapping clusters based
on asymptotic agreements, and (2) from each cluster, one client is selected to
minimize the expected variance of its model update. Our experiments show that
in heterogeneous scenarios our algorithm outperforms existing FL algorithms,
yielding more accurate results and faster convergence, validating the efficacy
of our approach.

Result: 在理论和实验中均优于现有基线算法，具有更紧的遗憾界。

Conclusion: RAVEN-UCB在非静态环境中表现出理论和实际上的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem is challenging in non-stationary
environments where reward distributions evolve dynamically. We introduce
RAVEN-UCB, a novel algorithm that combines theoretical rigor with practical
efficiency via variance-aware adaptation. It achieves tighter regret bounds
than UCB1 and UCB-V, with gap-dependent regret of order $K \sigma_{\max}^2 \log
T / \Delta$ and gap-independent regret of order $\sqrt{K T \log T}$. RAVEN-UCB
incorporates three innovations: (1) variance-driven exploration using
$\sqrt{\hat{\sigma}_k^2 / (N_k + 1)}$ in confidence bounds, (2) adaptive
control via $\alpha_t = \alpha_0 / \log(t + \epsilon)$, and (3) constant-time
recursive updates for efficiency. Experiments across non-stationary patterns -
distributional changes, periodic shifts, and temporary fluctuations - in
synthetic and logistics scenarios demonstrate its superiority over
state-of-the-art baselines, confirming theoretical and practical robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的多任务方法只能在小规模问题上训练轻量解码器模型，泛化能力有限。

Method: 通过知识蒸馏将多个单任务模型的政策知识转移到一个重型解码器模型中，并结合R3C推理策略。

Result: 在6个已知和10个未知VRP变体上，模型表现优异，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MTL-KD方法显著提升了多任务模型的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) is a
promising approach to train a unified model capable of solving multiple Vehicle
Routing Problem (VRP) variants. However, existing Reinforcement Learning
(RL)-based multi-task methods can only train light decoder models on
small-scale problems, exhibiting limited generalization ability when solving
large-scale problems. To overcome this limitation, this work introduces a novel
multi-task learning method driven by knowledge distillation (MTL-KD), which
enables the efficient training of heavy decoder models with strong
generalization ability. The proposed MTL-KD method transfers policy knowledge
from multiple distinct RL-based single-task models to a single heavy decoder
model, facilitating label-free training and effectively improving the model's
generalization ability across diverse tasks. In addition, we introduce a
flexible inference strategy termed Random Reordering Re-Construction (R3C),
which is specifically adapted for diverse VRP tasks and further boosts the
performance of the multi-task model. Experimental results on 6 seen and 10
unseen VRP variants with up to 1000 nodes indicate that our proposed method
consistently achieves superior performance on both uniform and real-world
benchmarks, demonstrating robust generalization abilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注注意力机制的近似计算，但忽略了Q、K、V投影的内存消耗问题。

Method: 采用Point-Approximate Matrix Multiplication (PAMM)技术压缩张量，减少内存占用。

Result: 内存消耗降低高达512倍，同时模型困惑度相似或更好。

Conclusion: PAMM是一种实用且互补的方法，可与高效注意力技术（如FlashAttention）结合使用。

Abstract: The Multi-Head Attention mechanism is central to LLM operation, and multiple
works target its compute and memory efficiency during training. While most
works focus on approximating the scaled dot product, the memory consumption of
the linear projections that compute the $Q$, $K$, and $V$ tensors from the
input $x$ is often overlooked. To address this, we propose Point-Approximate
Matrix Multiplication (PAMM), a novel tensor compression technique that reduces
memory consumption of the $Q,K,V$ projections in attention layers by a factor
of up to $\times 512$, effectively erasing their memory footprint, while
achieving similar or better final perplexity. PAMM is fully composable with
efficient attention techniques such as FlashAttention, making it a practical
and complementary method for memory-efficient LLM training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的反事实推理方法主要关注标记级别的反事实，但由于LM代理的动作空间开放且隐含在输出字符串中，这种方法往往不适用且可能导致偏见或无意义的反事实。

Method: 作者提出了“抽象反事实”框架，强调动作和交互的高层特征，支持针对用户相关特征的反事实推理。实验包括文本游戏和反事实文本生成，结合标记级和潜在空间干预。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成一致且有意义的反事实，同时最小化标记级方法的副作用。

Conclusion: “抽象反事实”框架为LM代理的反事实推理提供了一种更有效的方法，解决了传统方法的不足。

Abstract: Counterfactual inference is a powerful tool for analysing and evaluating
autonomous agents, but its application to language model (LM) agents remains
challenging. Existing work on counterfactuals in LMs has primarily focused on
token-level counterfactuals, which are often inadequate for LM agents due to
their open-ended action spaces. Unlike traditional agents with fixed, clearly
defined action spaces, the actions of LM agents are often implicit in the
strings they output, making their action spaces difficult to define and
interpret. Furthermore, the meanings of individual tokens can shift depending
on the context, adding complexity to token-level reasoning and sometimes
leading to biased or meaningless counterfactuals. We introduce \emph{Abstract
Counterfactuals}, a framework that emphasises high-level characteristics of
actions and interactions within an environment, enabling counterfactual
reasoning tailored to user-relevant features. Our experiments demonstrate that
the approach produces consistent and meaningful counterfactuals while
minimising the undesired side effects of token-level methods. We conduct
experiments on text-based games and counterfactual text generation, while
considering both token-level and latent-space interventions.

Motivation: EFM需要建模复杂的静电场，但这一过程具有挑战性，尤其是在考虑电容器板外复杂场时。

Method: 提出IFM，允许使用更一般的交互场，并设计了一种基于强相互作用的场实现方式。

Result: 在玩具和图像数据传输问题上展示了性能。

Conclusion: IFM解决了EFM中的建模问题，并扩展了其适用范围。

Abstract: Electrostatic field matching (EFM) has recently appeared as a novel
physics-inspired paradigm for data generation and transfer using the idea of an
electric capacitor. However, it requires modeling electrostatic fields using
neural networks, which is non-trivial because of the necessity to take into
account the complex field outside the capacitor plates. In this paper, we
propose Interaction Field Matching (IFM), a generalization of EFM which allows
using general interaction fields beyond the electrostatic one. Furthermore,
inspired by strong interactions between quarks and antiquarks in physics, we
design a particular interaction field realization which solves the problems
which arise when modeling electrostatic fields in EFM. We show the performance
on a series of toy and image data transfer problems.

Result: 在七个LLM基准测试中性能接近集中式模型，GPU内存减少70%，且抗重构攻击。

Conclusion: PC-MoE在隐私保护和性能之间取得了平衡，适用于资源受限的多方协作场景。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has been gaining popularity due to its successful
adaptation to large language models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce
Privacy-preserving Collaborative Mixture-of-Experts (PC-MoE), which leverages
the sparsity of the MoE architecture for memory-efficient decentralized
collaborative LLM training, enabling multiple parties with limited GPU-memory
and data resources to collectively train more capable LLMs than they could
achieve individually. At the same time, this approach protects training data
privacy of each participant by keeping training data, as well as parts of the
forward pass signal and gradients locally within each party. By design, PC-MoE
synergistically combines the strengths of distributed computation with strong
confidentiality assurances. Unlike most privacy-preserving schemes, which pay
for confidentiality with lower task accuracy, our framework breaks that
trade-off: across seven popular LLM benchmarks, it almost matches (and
sometimes exceeds) the performance and convergence rate of a fully centralized
model, enjoys near 70% peak GPU RAM reduction, while being fully robust against
reconstruction attacks.

Method: 通过建模ACV的轨迹，提出2CEOAFL算法，包括模型剪枝、训练和概率量化梯度卸载。

Result: 仿真结果显示，2CEOAFL性能与非剪枝和非量化版本相当。

Conclusion: 2CEOAFL在资源受限的ACV中实现了高效且性能良好的在线联邦学习。

Abstract: Privacy-preserving distributed machine learning (ML) and aerial connected
vehicle (ACV)-assisted edge computing have drawn significant attention lately.
Since the onboard sensors of ACVs can capture new data as they move along their
trajectories, the continual arrival of such 'newly' sensed data leads to online
learning and demands carefully crafting the trajectories. Besides, as typical
ACVs are inherently resource-constrained, computation- and
communication-efficient ML solutions are needed. Therefore, we propose a
computation- and communication-efficient online aerial federated learning
(2CEOAFL) algorithm to take the benefits of continual sensed data and limited
onboard resources of the ACVs. In particular, considering independently owned
ACVs act as selfish data collectors, we first model their trajectories
according to their respective time-varying data distributions. We then propose
a 2CEOAFL algorithm that allows the flying ACVs to (a) prune the received dense
ML model to make it shallow, (b) train the pruned model, and (c)
probabilistically quantize and offload their trained accumulated gradients to
the central server (CS). Our extensive simulation results show that the
proposed 2CEOAFL algorithm delivers comparable performances to its non-pruned
and nonquantized, hence, computation- and communication-inefficient
counterparts.

Abstract: Recent tabular Foundational Models (FM) such as TabPFN and TabICL, leverage
in-context learning to achieve strong performance without gradient updates or
fine-tuning. However, their robustness to adversarial manipulation remains
largely unexplored. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the
adversarial vulnerabilities of tabular FM, focusing on both their fragility to
targeted test-time attacks and their potential misuse as adversarial tools. We
show on three benchmarks in finance, cybersecurity and healthcare, that small,
structured perturbations to test inputs can significantly degrade prediction
accuracy, even when training context remain fixed. Additionally, we demonstrate
that tabular FM can be repurposed to generate transferable evasion to
conventional models such as random forests and XGBoost, and on a lesser extent
to deep tabular models. To improve tabular FM, we formulate the robustification
problem as an optimization of the weights (adversarial fine-tuning), or the
context (adversarial in-context learning). We introduce an in-context
adversarial training strategy that incrementally replaces the context with
adversarial perturbed instances, without updating model weights. Our approach
improves robustness across multiple tabular benchmarks. Together, these
findings position tabular FM as both a target and a source of adversarial
threats, highlighting the urgent need for robust training and evaluation
practices in this emerging paradigm.

Abstract: Solving inverse problems with neural networks benefits from very few
theoretical guarantees when it comes to the recovery guarantees. We provide in
this work convergence and recovery guarantees for self-supervised neural
networks applied to inverse problems, such as Deep Image/Inverse Prior, and
trained with inertia featuring both viscous and geometric Hessian-driven
dampings. We study both the continuous-time case, i.e., the trajectory of a
dynamical system, and the discrete case leading to an inertial algorithm with
an adaptive step-size. We show in the continuous-time case that the network can
be trained with an optimal accelerated exponential convergence rate compared to
the rate obtained with gradient flow. We also show that training a network with
our inertial algorithm enjoys similar recovery guarantees though with a less
sharp linear convergence rate.

Abstract: The inverse folding problem, aiming to design amino acid sequences that fold
into desired three-dimensional structures, is pivotal for various
biotechnological applications. Here, we introduce a novel approach leveraging
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune an inverse folding model
using feedback from a protein folding model. Given a target protein structure,
we begin by sampling candidate sequences from the inverse-folding model, then
predict the three-dimensional structure of each sequence with the folding model
to generate pairwise structural-preference labels. These labels are used to
fine-tune the inverse-folding model under the DPO objective. Our results on the
CATH 4.2 test set demonstrate that DPO fine-tuning not only improves sequence
recovery of baseline models but also leads to a significant improvement in
average TM-Score from 0.77 to 0.81, indicating enhanced structure similarity.
Furthermore, iterative application of our DPO-based method on challenging
protein structures yields substantial gains, with an average TM-Score increase
of 79.5\% with regard to the baseline model. This work establishes a promising
direction for enhancing protein sequence design ability from structure feedback
by effectively utilizing preference optimization.

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainties for machine learning (ML) models is a foundational
challenge in modern data analysis. This challenge is compounded by at least two
key aspects of the field: (a) inconsistent terminology surrounding uncertainty
and estimation across disciplines, and (b) the varying technical requirements
for establishing trustworthy uncertainties in diverse problem contexts. In this
position paper, we aim to clarify the depth of these challenges by identifying
these inconsistencies and articulating how different contexts impose distinct
epistemic demands. We examine the current landscape of estimation targets
(e.g., prediction, inference, simulation-based inference), uncertainty
constructs (e.g., frequentist, Bayesian, fiducial), and the approaches used to
map between them. Drawing on the literature, we highlight and explain examples
of problematic mappings. To help address these issues, we advocate for
standards that promote alignment between the \textit{intent} and
\textit{implementation} of uncertainty quantification (UQ) approaches. We
discuss several axes of trustworthiness that are necessary (if not sufficient)
for reliable UQ in ML models, and show how these axes can inform the design and
evaluation of uncertainty-aware ML systems. Our practical recommendations focus
on scientific ML, offering illustrative cases and use scenarios, particularly
in the context of simulation-based inference (SBI).

Abstract: We address the problem of Schr\"odinger potential estimation, which plays a
crucial role in modern generative modelling approaches based on Schr\"odinger
bridges and stochastic optimal control for SDEs. Given a simple prior diffusion
process, these methods search for a path between two given distributions
$\rho_0$ and $\rho_T^*$ requiring minimal efforts. The optimal drift in this
case can be expressed through a Schr\"odinger potential. In the present paper,
we study generalization ability of an empirical Kullback-Leibler (KL) risk
minimizer over a class of admissible log-potentials aimed at fitting the
marginal distribution at time $T$. Under reasonable assumptions on the target
distribution $\rho_T^*$ and the prior process, we derive a non-asymptotic
high-probability upper bound on the KL-divergence between $\rho_T^*$ and the
terminal density corresponding to the estimated log-potential. In particular,
we show that the excess KL-risk may decrease as fast as $O(\log^2 n / n)$ when
the sample size $n$ tends to infinity even if both $\rho_0$ and $\rho_T^*$ have
unbounded supports.

Motivation: 在线实验中，标准A/B测试在多候选和多指标场景下统计功效不足，而传统AED方法难以推断实验统计量（如平均处理效应）。

Result: SHRVar实现了指数级降低的错误概率，数值实验验证了其优越性能。

Conclusion: 新框架在多指标和异方差场景下显著优于传统方法，为在线实验提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Standard A/B tests in online experiments face statistical power challenges
when testing multiple candidates simultaneously, while adaptive experimental
designs (AED) alone fall short in inferring experiment statistics such as the
average treatment effect, especially with many metrics (e.g., revenue, safety)
and heterogeneous variances. This paper proposes a fixed-budget multi-metric
AED framework with a two-phase structure: an adaptive exploration phase to
identify the best treatment, and a validation phase with an A/B test to verify
the treatment's quality and infer statistics. We propose SHRVar, which
generalizes sequential halving (SH) (Karnin et al., 2013) with a novel
relative-variance-based sampling and an elimination strategy built on reward
z-values. It achieves a provable error probability that decreases
exponentially, where the exponent generalizes the complexity measure for SH
(Karnin et al., 2013) and SHVar (Lalitha et al., 2023) with homogeneous and
heterogeneous variances, respectively. Numerical experiments verify our
analysis and demonstrate the superior performance of this new framework.

Result: ZSPO在温和条件下以多项式收敛率达到平稳策略，数值实验显示其在链接函数不匹配时的优越性。

Conclusion: ZSPO是一种有效的RLHF算法，适用于链接函数未知的场景，具有理论保证和实际优势。

Abstract: Link functions, which characterize how human preferences are generated from
the value function of an RL problem, are a crucial component in designing RLHF
algorithms. Almost all RLHF algorithms, including state-of-the-art ones in
empirical studies such as DPO and PPO, assume the link function is known to the
agent (e.g., a logistic function according to the Bradley-Terry model), which
is arguably unrealistic considering the complex nature of human preferences. To
avoid link function mis-specification, this paper studies general RLHF problems
with unknown link functions. We propose a novel policy optimization algorithm
called ZSPO based on a new zeroth-order policy optimization method, where the
key is to use human preference to construct a parameter update direction that
is positively correlated with the true policy gradient direction. ZSPO achieves
it by estimating the sign of the value function difference instead of
estimating the gradient from the value function difference, so it does not
require knowing the link function. Under mild conditions, ZSPO converges to a
stationary policy with a polynomial convergence rate depending on the number of
policy iterations and trajectories per iteration. Numerical results also show
the superiority of ZSPO under link function mismatch.

established that the optimal error under such instance-targeted poisoning
attacks scales as $\Theta(d\eta)$, where $d$ is the VC dimension of the
hypothesis class arXiv:2210.02713. In this work, we resolve the corresponding
question in the agnostic setting. We show that the optimal excess error is
$\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{d\eta})$, answering one of the main open problems left by
Hanneke et al. To achieve this rate, it is necessary to use randomized
learners: Hanneke et al. showed that deterministic learners can be forced to
suffer error close to 1, even under small amounts of poisoning. Perhaps
surprisingly, our upper bound remains valid even when the learner's random bits
are fully visible to the adversary . In the other direction, our lower bound is
stronger than standard PAC-style bounds: instead of tailoring a hard
distribution separately for each sample size, we exhibit a single fixed
distribution under which the adversary can enforce an excess error of
$\Omega(\sqrt{d\eta})$ infinitely often.

*Qijun Luo,Mengqi Li,Lei Zhao,Xiao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StreamBP是一种内存高效且精确的反向传播方法，通过序列维度的线性分解显著减少激活值和logits的内存成本，适用于SFT、GRPO和DPO等常见目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长序列数据训练语言模型对复杂任务（如长链推理）至关重要，但随着序列长度增加，反向传播过程中存储激活值的内存成本巨大。

Method: StreamBP通过层级的序列维度线性分解链式法则，减少内存使用，并利用语言模型的因果结构降低计算FLOPs和加速反向传播。

Result: StreamBP将反向传播的最大序列长度扩展了2.8-5.5倍，同时保持或减少反向传播时间，并支持多GPU训练。

Conclusion: StreamBP是一种高效且通用的方法，可直接集成到任何Transformer模型的训练流程中。

Abstract: Training language models on long sequence data is a demanding requirement for
enhancing the model's capability on complex tasks, e.g., long-chain reasoning.
However, as the sequence length scales up, the memory cost for storing
activation values becomes huge during the Backpropagation (BP) process, even
with the application of gradient checkpointing technique. To tackle this
challenge, we propose a memory-efficient and exact BP method called StreamBP,
which performs a linear decomposition of the chain rule along the sequence
dimension in a layer-wise manner, significantly reducing the memory cost of
activation values and logits. The proposed method is applicable to common
objectives such as SFT, GRPO, and DPO. From an implementation perspective,
StreamBP achieves less computational FLOPs and faster BP speed by leveraging
the causal structure of the language model. Compared to gradient checkpointing,
StreamBP scales up the maximum sequence length of BP by 2.8-5.5 times larger,
while using comparable or even less BP time. Note that StreamBP's sequence
length scaling ability can be directly transferred to batch size scaling for
accelerating training. We further develop a communication-efficient distributed
StreamBP to effectively support multi-GPU training and broaden its
applicability. Our code can be easily integrated into the training pipeline of
any transformer models and is available at https://github.com/Ledzy/StreamBP.

Result: 证明了最小复杂度插值算法的最优性，展示了确定性有限自动机的长度复杂度为2n-2，以及C-RASP函数类的上界。

Conclusion: 长度泛化与语言等价问题的可判定性相关，C-RASP函数类的长度复杂度随层数和头数增加而增长。

Abstract: Length generalization is the ability of a learning algorithm to learn a
hypothesis which generalizes to longer inputs than the inputs in the training
set. In this paper, we provide provable guarantees of length generalization for
various classes of functions in an idealized setting. First, we formalize the
framework of non-asymptotic length generalization, which requires a computable
upper bound for the minimum input length that guarantees length generalization,
as a function of the complexity of ground-truth function under some given
complexity measure. We refer to this minimum input length to length generalize
as length complexity. We show the Minimum-Complexity Interpolator learning
algorithm achieves optimal length complexity. We further show that whether a
function class admits non-asymptotic length generalization is equivalent to the
decidability of its language equivalence problem, which implies that there is
no computable upper bound for the length complexity of Context-Free Grammars.
On the positive side, we show that the length complexity of Deterministic
Finite Automata is $2n - 2$ where $n$ is the number of states of the
ground-truth automaton. Our main results are upper bounds of length complexity
for a subset of a transformer-related function class called C-RASP (Yang &
Chiang, 2024). We show that the length complexity of 1-layer C-RASP functions
is $O(T^2)$ when the ground-truth function has precision $T$, and that the
length complexity of 2-layer C-RASP functions is $O(T^{O(K)})$ when the
ground-truth function has precision $T$ and $K$ heads.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential tools for analyzing
graph-structured data in domains such as drug discovery and financial analysis,
leading to growing demands for model transparency. Recent advances in
explainable GNNs have addressed this need by revealing important subgraphs that
influence predictions, but these explanation mechanisms may inadvertently
expose models to security risks. This paper investigates how such explanations
potentially leak critical decision logic that can be exploited for model
stealing. We propose {\method}, a novel stealing framework that integrates
explanation alignment for capturing decision logic with guided data
augmentation for efficient training under limited queries, enabling effective
replication of both the predictive behavior and underlying reasoning patterns
of target models. Experiments on molecular graph datasets demonstrate that our
approach shows advantages over conventional methods in model stealing. This
work highlights important security considerations for the deployment of
explainable GNNs in sensitive domains and suggests the need for protective
measures against explanation-based attacks. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 稀疏自编码器（SAE）的线性假设可能不足以捕捉神经网络表示中的层次和非线性特征，MP-SAE通过改进设计解决了这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络表示中是否存在与稀疏自编码器（SAE）线性假设不符的层次和非线性特征，并探索如何改进SAE以更好地捕捉这些特征。

Method: 提出MP-SAE，一种基于匹配追踪（MP）算法的改进SAE，通过序列化编码步骤捕捉层次和非线性特征。

Result: MP-SAE成功捕捉了条件正交的层次特征和非线性特征，揭示了视觉语言模型中共享的结构，并支持自适应稀疏性。

Conclusion: 研究支持应从表示的现象学出发设计解释性方法，而非仅依赖线性假设。

Abstract: Motivated by the hypothesis that neural network representations encode
abstract, interpretable features as linearly accessible, approximately
orthogonal directions, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become a popular tool in
interpretability. However, recent work has demonstrated phenomenology of model
representations that lies outside the scope of this hypothesis, showing
signatures of hierarchical, nonlinear, and multi-dimensional features. This
raises the question: do SAEs represent features that possess structure at odds
with their motivating hypothesis? If not, does avoiding this mismatch help
identify said features and gain further insights into neural network
representations? To answer these questions, we take a construction-based
approach and re-contextualize the popular matching pursuits (MP) algorithm from
sparse coding to design MP-SAE -- an SAE that unrolls its encoder into a
sequence of residual-guided steps, allowing it to capture hierarchical and
nonlinearly accessible features. Comparing this architecture with existing SAEs
on a mixture of synthetic and natural data settings, we show: (i) hierarchical
concepts induce conditionally orthogonal features, which existing SAEs are
unable to faithfully capture, and (ii) the nonlinear encoding step of MP-SAE
recovers highly meaningful features, helping us unravel shared structure in the
seemingly dichotomous representation spaces of different modalities in a
vision-language model, hence demonstrating the assumption that useful features
are solely linearly accessible is insufficient. We also show that the
sequential encoder principle of MP-SAE affords an additional benefit of
adaptive sparsity at inference time, which may be of independent interest.
Overall, we argue our results provide credence to the idea that
interpretability should begin with the phenomenology of representations, with
methods emerging from assumptions that fit it.

Result: 发现RAG存在固有泛化误差上限，并通过实验验证了ICL和RAG的样本效率。

Conclusion: RAG在理论和实证中均表现出优于传统方法的潜力。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has seen many empirical successes in
recent years by aiding the LLM with external knowledge. However, its
theoretical aspect has remained mostly unexplored. In this paper, we propose
the first finite-sample generalization bound for RAG in in-context linear
regression and derive an exact bias-variance tradeoff. Our framework views the
retrieved texts as query-dependent noisy in-context examples and recovers the
classical in-context learning (ICL) and standard RAG as the limit cases. Our
analysis suggests that an intrinsic ceiling on generalization error exists on
RAG as opposed to the ICL. Furthermore, our framework is able to model
retrieval both from the training data and from external corpora by introducing
uniform and non-uniform RAG noise. In line with our theory, we show the sample
efficiency of ICL and RAG empirically with experiments on common QA benchmarks,
such as Natural Questions and TriviaQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有W2SG方法需要额外弱模型或复杂流程，计算和内存开销大。$f$-散度损失在机器学习中表现优异，因此引入W2SG。

Method: 引入$f$-散度作为信息论损失函数框架，分析其理论限制和等价性，并通过实验验证。

Result: $f$-散度损失（如KL散度）能有效提升强模型的泛化能力和噪声容忍性。

Conclusion: $f$-散度损失为W2SG提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization (W2SG) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
stimulating the capabilities of strong pre-trained models by leveraging
supervision from weaker supervisors. To improve the performance of the strong
model, existing methods often require additional weak models or complex
procedures, leading to substantial computational and memory overhead. Motivated
by the effectiveness of $f$-divergence loss in various machine learning
domains, we introduce $f$-divergence as an information-theoretic loss function
framework in W2SG. Our theoretical analysis reveals fundamental limitations and
equivalence of different $f$-divergence losses in W2SG, supported by sample
complexity bounds and information-theoretic insights. We empirically
demonstrate that $f$-divergence loss, which generalizes widely-used metrics
like KL divergence, effectively improves generalization and noise tolerance of
the strong model in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流体流动的多尺度动态和对初始条件的极端敏感性使得统计建模非常困难。现有的扩散模型需要大量采样步骤。

Method: 引入修正流框架，学习时间依赖的速度场，将输入分布沿近乎直线的轨迹传输到输出分布。通过将采样转化为ODE求解，减少步骤。

Result: 在8步内实现与128步扩散模型相同的后验分布，保留细尺度特征，显著减少推理时间。

Conclusion: 修正流框架在保持高保真度的同时，大幅提高了采样效率。

Abstract: The statistical modeling of fluid flows is very challenging due to their
multiscale dynamics and extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. While
recently proposed conditional diffusion models achieve high fidelity, they
typically require hundreds of stochastic sampling steps at inference. We
introduce a rectified flow framework that learns a time-dependent velocity
field, transporting input to output distributions along nearly straight
trajectories. By casting sampling as solving an ordinary differential equation
(ODE) along this straighter flow field, our method makes each integration step
much more effective, using as few as eight steps versus (more than) 128 steps
in standard score-based diffusion, without sacrificing predictive fidelity.
Experiments on challenging multiscale flow benchmarks show that rectified flows
recover the same posterior distributions as diffusion models, preserve
fine-scale features that MSE-trained baselines miss, and deliver
high-resolution samples in a fraction of inference time.

Motivation: 现有预训练时间序列模型在协变量支持或利用上存在不足，限制了零样本预测的性能和适用性。

Result: COSMIC在零样本预测中达到最先进性能，无论是否使用协变量。

Conclusion: COSMIC通过有效利用协变量，显著提升了零样本预测的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Pretrained time series models, capable of zero-shot forecasting, have
demonstrated significant potential in enhancing both the performance and
accessibility of time series forecasting. However, existing pretrained models
either do not support covariates or fail to incorporate them effectively. We
introduce COSMIC, a zero-shot forecasting model that utilizes covariates via
in-context learning. To address the challenge of data scarcity, we propose
Informative Covariate Augmentation, which enables the training of COSMIC
without requiring any datasets that include covariates. COSMIC achieves
state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot forecasting, both with and without
covariates. Our quantitative and qualitative analysis demonstrates that COSMIC
effectively leverages covariates in zero-shot forecasting.

Motivation: 现有大规模模型低秩适应方法存在稳定秩低于线性代数秩的问题，导致微调性能下降。

Method: 提出PoLAR参数化方法，将低秩更新分解为两个方向矩阵（约束于Stiefel流形）和一个无约束尺度矩阵，并结合黎曼优化。

Result: 理论证明PoLAR在低秩适应问题上收敛速度指数级提升，实验在语言理解、常识推理和数学问题解决任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: PoLAR有效解决了低秩适应中的子空间利用不足问题，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: We show that low-rank adaptation of large-scale models suffers from a low
stable rank that is well below the linear algebraic rank of the subspace,
degrading fine-tuning performance. To mitigate the underutilization of the
allocated subspace, we propose PoLAR, a parameterization inspired by the polar
decomposition that factorizes the low-rank update into two direction matrices
constrained to Stiefel manifolds and an unconstrained scale matrix. Our theory
shows that PoLAR yields an exponentially faster convergence rate on a canonical
low-rank adaptation problem. Pairing the parameterization with Riemannian
optimization leads to consistent gains on three different benchmarks testing
general language understanding, commonsense reasoning, and mathematical problem
solving with base model sizes ranging from 350M to 27B.

Method: TIF框架包括目标信息标识器和目标偏好优化方法，分别用于区分不需要的单词和通用单词，并通过损失函数优化遗忘过程。

Result: 在TOFU和MUSE基准测试中，TIF框架显著提升了遗忘效果，同时保持了模型效用，取得了最优结果。

Conclusion: TIF框架有效解决了过度遗忘问题，为语言模型的隐私和版权问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), pre-trained on massive text corpora, exhibit
remarkable human-level language understanding, reasoning, and decision-making
abilities. However, they tend to memorize unwanted information, such as private
or copyrighted content, raising significant privacy and legal concerns.
Unlearning has emerged as a promising solution, but existing methods face a
significant challenge of over-forgetting. This issue arises because they
indiscriminately suppress the generation of all the tokens in forget samples,
leading to a substantial loss of model utility. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce the Targeted Information Forgetting (TIF) framework, which consists
of (1) a flexible targeted information identifier designed to differentiate
between unwanted words (UW) and general words (GW) in the forget samples, and
(2) a novel Targeted Preference Optimization approach that leverages Logit
Preference Loss to unlearn unwanted information associated with UW and
Preservation Loss to retain general information in GW, effectively improving
the unlearning process while mitigating utility degradation. Extensive
experiments on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed TIF
framework enhances unlearning effectiveness while preserving model utility and
achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: 通过联想记忆视角，为扩散模型的记忆-泛化现象提供了新见解，并验证了虚假状态的理论预测。

Abstract: Hopfield networks are associative memory (AM) systems, designed for storing
and retrieving patterns as local minima of an energy landscape. In the
classical Hopfield model, an interesting phenomenon occurs when the amount of
training data reaches its critical memory load $- spurious\,\,states$, or
unintended stable points, emerge at the end of the retrieval dynamics, leading
to incorrect recall. In this work, we examine diffusion models, commonly used
in generative modeling, from the perspective of AMs. The training phase of
diffusion model is conceptualized as memory encoding (training data is stored
in the memory). The generation phase is viewed as an attempt of memory
retrieval. In the small data regime the diffusion model exhibits a strong
memorization phase, where the network creates distinct basins of attraction
around each sample in the training set, akin to the Hopfield model below the
critical memory load. In the large data regime, a different phase appears where
an increase in the size of the training set fosters the creation of new
attractor states that correspond to manifolds of the generated samples.
Spurious states appear at the boundary of this transition and correspond to
emergent attractor states, which are absent in the training set, but, at the
same time, have distinct basins of attraction around them. Our findings
provide: a novel perspective on the memorization-generalization phenomenon in
diffusion models via the lens of AMs, theoretical prediction of existence of
spurious states, empirical validation of this prediction in commonly-used
diffusion models.

Abstract: Web applications are critical to modern software ecosystems, yet ensuring
their reliability remains challenging due to the complexity and dynamic nature
of web interfaces. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown
promise in automating complex tasks, but limitations persist in handling
dynamic navigation flows and complex form interactions. This paper presents an
automated system for generating test cases for two key aspects of web
application testing: site navigation and form filling. For site navigation, the
system employs screen transition graphs and LLMs to model navigation flows and
generate test scenarios. For form filling, it uses state graphs to handle
conditional forms and automates Selenium script generation. Key contributions
include: (1) a novel integration of graph structures and LLMs for site
navigation testing, (2) a state graph-based approach for automating
form-filling test cases, and (3) a comprehensive dataset for evaluating
form-interaction testing. Experimental results demonstrate the system's
effectiveness in improving test coverage and robustness, advancing the state of

field of automated software engineering. Meanwhile, the widespread adoption of
Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised
concerns regarding data contamination and its potential impact on model
performance evaluation. This paper presents a systematic empirical study to
investigate the fine-grained data contamination on code intelligence tasks. Our
study involves diverse representative PLMs, namely RoBERTa and GPT-2, and LLMs,
namely LLaMA and StarCoder, covering three major tasks: code translation, code
generation, and code summarization. We categorize contamination scenarios into
four types according to the code intelligence practice, namely input-only,
output-only, unpaired, and paired contamination settings, and construct
corresponding experimental and control groups for exploration.
  Experimental results show that, under the pre-training, fine-tuning, and
inference paradigm adopted by PLMs, even deliberately injecting paired
contamination does not lead to significant performance overestimation. But
direct inference or small-scale fine-tuning uncovers the contamination effects.
In contrast, LLMs with pre-training and inference paradigm are significantly
affected by the paired contamination. Apart from the above, other contamination
scenarios have no impact on both PLMs and LLMs. Our findings challenge the
conventional belief that contamination inevitably leads to performance
overestimation, providing new insights into the evaluation and deployment of
code intelligence models.

### [425] [How do Pre-Trained Models Support Software Engineering? An Empirical Study in Hugging Face](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03013)
*Alexandra González,Xavier Franch,David Lo,Silverio Martínez-Fernández*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对软件工程（SE）任务的预训练模型（PTM）分类方法，通过分析Hugging Face（HF）平台上的PTMs，识别出2,205个与SE相关的模型，并发现代码生成是最常见的SE任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的开源预训练模型（PTMs）资源缺乏针对软件工程（SE）需求的分类，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 通过系统收集HF平台的PTMs数据，结合模型描述、元数据和相关论文摘要，经过多步过滤（如异常检测、去重和使用Gemini 2.0 Flash验证）确认SE相关性。

Result: 识别出2,205个SE PTMs，代码生成是最常见的SE任务，而需求工程和软件设计任务较少。自2023年第二季度以来，SE PTMs数量显著增加。

Conclusion: 该分类为未来自动化SE场景（如PTMs的采样和选择）提供了基础。

Abstract: Open-Source Pre-Trained Models (PTMs) provide extensive resources for various
Machine Learning (ML) tasks, yet these resources lack a classification tailored
to Software Engineering (SE) needs. To address this gap, we derive a taxonomy
encompassing 147 SE tasks and apply an SE-oriented classification to PTMs in a
popular open-source ML repository, Hugging Face (HF). Our repository mining
study began with a systematically gathered database of PTMs from the HF API,
considering their model card descriptions and metadata, and the abstract of the
associated arXiv papers. We confirmed SE relevance through multiple filtering
steps: detecting outliers, identifying near-identical PTMs, and the use of
Gemini 2.0 Flash, which was validated with five pilot studies involving three
human annotators. This approach uncovered 2,205 SE PTMs. We find that code
generation is the most common SE task among PTMs, primarily focusing on
software implementation, while requirements engineering and software design
activities receive limited attention. In terms of ML tasks, text generation
dominates within SE PTMs. Notably, the number of SE PTMs has increased markedly
since 2023 Q2. Our classification provides a solid foundation for future
automated SE scenarios, such as the sampling and selection of suitable PTMs.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FlashMLA-ETAP是一种新框架，通过ETAP技术优化多头潜在注意力（MLA）推理，显著提升计算效率，适用于单实例部署场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在单台多GPU服务器上部署大型模型（如DeepSeek-R1 671B）时，MLA推理效率低下的问题。

Method: 提出ETAP技术，通过重新配置注意力计算中的转置操作，减少冗余计算，并与WGMMA操作对齐。

Result: 在64K序列长度下，速度提升2.78倍，优于FlashAttention-3和FlashInfer，同时保持数值稳定性。

Conclusion: FlashMLA-ETAP为资源受限的推理提供了高效解决方案，支持中端GPU的扩展应用。

Abstract: Efficient inference of Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) is challenged by
deploying the DeepSeek-R1 671B model on a single Multi-GPU server. This paper
introduces FlashMLA-ETAP, a novel framework that enhances MLA inference for the
single-instance deployment scenario on NVIDIA H20 GPUs. We propose the
Efficient Transpose Attention Pipeline (ETAP), which reconfigures attention
computation through transposition to align the KV context length with the
\(M\)-dimension in WGMMA operations, significantly reducing redundant
computations. FlashMLA-ETAP achieves a 2.78x speedup over FlashMLA at 64K
sequence length (batch size 16), with 5.24x and 4.94x improvements over
FlashAttention-3 and FlashInfer, respectively, while maintaining numerical
stability with a 15.2x lower RMSE (\(1.25 \times 10^{-5}\)) than
FlashAttention-3. Furthermore, ETAP's design enables seamless integration into
frameworks like FlashAttention-3 and FlashInfer, supported by a detailed
theoretical analysis. Our work addresses a critical gap in resource-constrained
inference, offering a scalable solution for mid-tier GPUs and paving the way
for broader adoption in hardware-aware optimization. Code is available at

*Yuhao Shen,Junyi Shen,Quan Kong,Tianyu Liu,Yao Lu,Cong Wang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SpecBranch的新框架，通过分支并行技术加速LLM推理，解决了现有推测解码方法中的串行执行瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码方法因串行执行导致模型间相互等待，限制了效率提升。

Method: 引入分支并行技术，分析并行化与令牌回滚的权衡，采用并行推测分支和自适应草稿长度策略。

Result: 实验显示，SpecBranch在多种模型和基准测试中实现了1.8×∼4.5×的加速，并减少了50%的回滚令牌。

Conclusion: SpecBranch通过分支并行显著提升了LLM推理效率，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Recently, speculative decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising technique to
accelerate LLM inference by employing a small draft model to propose draft
tokens in advance, and validating them in parallel with the large target model.
However, the existing SD methods still remain fundamentally constrained by
their serialized execution, which causes the mutual waiting bubbles between the
draft and target models. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from
branch prediction in modern processors and propose a novel framework
\textbf{SpecBranch} to unlock branch parallelism in SD. Specifically, we first
take an in-depth analysis of the potential of branch parallelism in SD, and
recognize that the key challenge lies in the trade-offs between parallelization
and token rollback. Based on the analysis, we strategically introduce parallel
speculative branches to preemptively hedge against likely rejections.
Meanwhile, to enhance parallelism, we jointly orchestrate adaptive draft
lengths with a hybrid combination of the implicit draft model confidence and
explicit reusing of target model features. Extensive experiments across various
models and benchmarks show that SpecBranch achieves over \textbf{1.8}$\times
\sim$ \textbf{4.5}$\times$ speedups against the auto-regressive decoding and
reduces rollback tokens by $\textbf{50}$\% for poorly aligned models, realizing
its applicability for real-world deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI/ML系统中复杂故障模式的实时监测和诊断问题，提升系统性能和稳定性。

Method: 利用eBPF技术收集GPU、网络等硬件及CUDA、PyTorch等软件的性能数据，结合GMM进行统计建模和聚类分析。

Result: 在多节点分布式训练场景中验证了eACGM的低开销和高效率，能稳定检测性能异常。

Conclusion: eACGM适用于实际生产环境，为大规模AI/ML系统提供性能优化和故障诊断支持。

Abstract: We present eACGM, a full-stack AI/ML system monitoring framework based on
eBPF. eACGM collects real-time performance data from key hardware components,
including the GPU and network communication layer, as well as from key software
stacks such as CUDA, Python, and PyTorch, all without requiring any code
instrumentation or modifications. Additionally, it leverages libnvml to gather
process-level GPU resource usage information. By applying a Gaussian Mixture
Model (GMM) to the collected multidimensional performance metrics for
statistical modeling and clustering analysis, eACGM effectively identifies
complex failure modes, such as latency anomalies, hardware failures, and
communication inefficiencies, enabling rapid diagnosis of system bottlenecks
and abnormal behaviors.
  To evaluate eACGM's effectiveness and practicality, we conducted extensive
empirical studies and case analyses in multi-node distributed training
scenarios. The results demonstrate that eACGM, while maintaining a
non-intrusive and low-overhead profile, successfully captures critical
performance anomalies during model training and inference. Its stable anomaly
detection performance and comprehensive monitoring capabilities validate its
applicability and scalability in real-world production environments, providing
strong support for performance optimization and fault diagnosis in large-scale
AI/ML systems.

*Prachi Jadhav,Hongwei Jin,Ewa Deelman,Prasanna Balaprakash*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的HPC作业调度方法，通过ReAct框架实现迭代、可解释的决策，并在多种实际场景中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HPC调度方法（如FCFS或优化技术）难以适应动态负载和异构系统，因此需要更灵活、透明的解决方案。

Method: 采用LLM和ReAct框架，结合历史记录和自然语言反馈，通过约束模块确保决策可行性。

Result: 在多种实际HPC场景中，LLM调度器能平衡多目标并提供透明推理，但计算开销较大。

Conclusion: LLM在HPC调度中具有潜力，但需权衡推理质量与计算效率，为动态环境中的复杂调度问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: High-Performance Computing (HPC) job scheduling involves balancing
conflicting objectives such as minimizing makespan, reducing wait times,
optimizing resource use, and ensuring fairness. Traditional methods, including
heuristic-based (e.g., First-Come-First-Served) or intensive optimization
techniques, often lack adaptability to dynamic workloads and heterogeneous HPC
systems. To address this, we propose a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based
scheduler using a ReAct-style framework (Reason + Act), enabling iterative,
interpretable decision-making. The system incorporates a scratchpad memory to
track scheduling history and refine decisions via natural language feedback,
while a constraint enforcement module ensures feasibility and safety. We
evaluate our approach using OpenAI's O4-Mini and Anthropic's Claude 3.7 across
seven real-world HPC workload scenarios, including heterogeneous mixes, bursty
patterns, and adversarial cases. Comparisons against FCFS, Shortest Job First,
and Google OR-Tools (on 10 to 100 jobs) reveal that LLM-based scheduling
effectively balances multiple objectives while offering transparent reasoning
through natural language traces. The method excels in constraint satisfaction
and adapts to diverse workloads without domain-specific training. However, a
trade-off between reasoning quality and computational overhead challenges
real-time deployment. This work presents the first comprehensive study of
reasoning-capable LLMs for HPC scheduling, demonstrating their potential to
handle multiobjective optimization while highlighting limitations in
computational efficiency. The findings provide insights into leveraging
advanced language models for complex scheduling problems in dynamic HPC
environments.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: EvoGit是一个去中心化的多智能体框架，通过自主代码进化驱动协作软件开发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在实现无需集中协调、显式消息传递或共享内存的协作软件开发。

Method: 基于Git的系统追踪代码版本谱系，支持细粒度分支和隐式并发。

Result: 实验证明EvoGit能自主生成功能性和模块化的软件。

Conclusion: EvoGit为去中心化、自动化和持续软件开发提供了新范式。

Abstract: We introduce EvoGit, a decentralized multi-agent framework for collaborative
software development driven by autonomous code evolution. EvoGit deploys a
population of independent coding agents, each proposing edits to a shared
codebase without centralized coordination, explicit message passing, or shared
memory. Instead, all coordination emerges through a Git-based phylogenetic
graph that tracks the full version lineage and enables agents to asynchronously
read from and write to the evolving code repository. This graph-based structure
supports fine-grained branching, implicit concurrency, and scalable agent
interaction while preserving a consistent historical record. Human involvement
is minimal but strategic: users define high-level goals, periodically review
the graph, and provide lightweight feedback to promote promising directions or
prune unproductive ones. Experiments demonstrate EvoGit's ability to
autonomously produce functional and modular software artifacts across two
real-world tasks: (1) building a web application from scratch using modern
frameworks, and (2) constructing a meta-level system that evolves its own
language-model-guided solver for the bin-packing optimization problem. Our
results underscore EvoGit's potential to establish a new paradigm for
decentralized, automated, and continual software development. EvoGit is

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于机器学习的方法，用于分析分布式系统中一致性违规故障（CVFs）的影响，并以Dijkstra的令牌环问题为例。通过计算程序转换等级及其影响，量化CVFs对系统行为的影响。为解决状态空间爆炸问题，采用了前馈神经网络（FNN）和分布式神经网络模型，实验结果显示模型性能良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式系统中一致性违规故障（CVFs）会导致节点操作过时或不准确的数据，影响系统收敛和性能。研究旨在量化CVFs的影响并提出解决方案。

Method: 使用Dijkstra的令牌环问题作为案例，计算程序转换等级及其影响。为解决状态空间爆炸问题，采用FNN和分布式神经网络模型，并利用TensorFlow的分布式API进行训练。

Result: 实验结果显示模型性能良好，测试损失为4.39，平均绝对误差为1.5。分布式训练在CPU上未显著提升速度，但硬件加速器（如GPU或TPU）可能提升可扩展性。

Conclusion: 提出的机器学习方法能有效量化CVFs的影响，未来可通过硬件加速器进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Distributed systems frequently encounter consistency violation faults (cvfs),
where nodes operate on outdated or inaccurate data, adversely affecting
convergence and overall system performance. This study presents a machine
learning-based approach for analyzing the impact of CVFs, using Dijkstra's
Token Ring problem as a case study. By computing program transition ranks and
their corresponding effects, the proposed method quantifies the influence of
cvfs on system behavior. To address the state space explosion encountered in
larger graphs, two models are implemented: a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)
and a distributed neural network leveraging TensorFlow's \texttt{tf.distribute}
API. These models are trained on datasets generated from smaller graphs (3 to
10 nodes) to predict parameters essential for determining rank effects.
Experimental results demonstrate promising performance, with a test loss of
4.39 and a mean absolute error of 1.5. Although distributed training on a CPU
did not yield significant speed improvements over a single-device setup, the
findings suggest that scalability could be enhanced through the use of advanced
hardware accelerators such as GPUs or TPUs.

TL;DR: MorphServe是一个动态、工作负载感知的大型语言模型（LLM）服务框架，通过形态适应技术解决动态和突发工作负载下的服务效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有服务框架和静态模型压缩技术无法适应工作负载波动，导致服务级别目标（SLO）违规或持续精度下降。

Method: MorphServe引入两种异步、令牌级运行时机制：量化层交换和压力感知KV缓存调整。

Result: 实验表明，MorphServe将平均SLO违规减少92.45%，P95 TTFT延迟提升2.2x-3.9x，且不影响生成质量。

Conclusion: MorphServe是动态环境中LLM部署的实用且弹性解决方案。

Abstract: Efficiently serving large language models (LLMs) under dynamic and bursty
workloads remains a key challenge for real-world deployment. Existing serving
frameworks and static model compression techniques fail to adapt to workload
fluctuations, leading to either service-level objective (SLO) violations under
full-precision serving or persistent accuracy degradation with static
quantization. We present MorphServe, a dynamic, workload-aware LLM serving
framework based on morphological adaptation. MorphServe introduces two
asynchronous, token-level runtime mechanisms: quantized layer swapping, which
selectively replaces less impactful layers with quantized alternatives during
high-load periods, and pressure-aware KV cache resizing, which dynamically
adjusts KV cache capacity in response to memory pressure. These mechanisms
enable state-preserving transitions with minimum runtime overhead and are fully
compatible with modern scheduling and attention techniques. Extensive
experiments on Vicuna and Llama family models with real-world workloads
demonstrate that MorphServe reduces average SLO violations by 92.45 percent and
improves the P95 TTFT latency by 2.2x-3.9x compared to full-precision serving,
without compromising generation quality. These results establish MorphServe as
a practical and elastic solution for LLM deployment in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Large-scale atomistic simulations are essential to bridge computational
materials and chemistry to realistic materials and drug discovery applications.
In the past few years, rapid developments of machine learning interatomic
potentials (MLIPs) have offered a solution to scale up quantum mechanical
calculations. Parallelizing these interatomic potentials across multiple
devices poses a challenging, but promising approach to further extending
simulation scales to real-world applications. In this work, we present
DistMLIP, an efficient distributed inference platform for MLIPs based on
zero-redundancy, graph-level parallelization. In contrast to conventional
space-partitioning parallelization, DistMLIP enables efficient MLIP
parallelization through graph partitioning, allowing multi-device inference on
flexible MLIP model architectures like multi-layer graph neural networks.
DistMLIP presents an easy-to-use, flexible, plug-in interface that enables
distributed inference of pre-existing MLIPs. We demonstrate DistMLIP on four
widely used and state-of-the-art MLIPs: CHGNet, MACE, TensorNet, and eSEN. We
show that existing foundational potentials can perform near-million-atom
calculations at the scale of a few seconds on 8 GPUs with DistMLIP.

Conclusion: SynergyRCA展示了LLMs在图数据库支持下对Kubernetes RCA的有效性，为动态云环境提供了高效、精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Kubernetes, a notably complex and distributed system, utilizes an array of
controllers to uphold cluster management logic through state reconciliation.
Nevertheless, maintaining state consistency presents significant challenges due
to unexpected failures, network disruptions, and asynchronous issues,
especially within dynamic cloud environments. These challenges result in
operational disruptions and economic losses, underscoring the necessity for
robust root cause analysis (RCA) to enhance Kubernetes reliability. The
development of large language models (LLMs) presents a promising direction for
RCA. However, existing methodologies encounter several obstacles, including the
diverse and evolving nature of Kubernetes incidents, the intricate context of
incidents, and the polymorphic nature of these incidents. In this paper, we
introduce SynergyRCA, an innovative tool that leverages LLMs with retrieval
augmentation from graph databases and enhancement with expert prompts.
SynergyRCA constructs a StateGraph to capture spatial and temporal
relationships and utilizes a MetaGraph to outline entity connections. Upon the
occurrence of an incident, an LLM predicts the most pertinent resource, and
SynergyRCA queries the MetaGraph and StateGraph to deliver context-specific
insights for RCA. We evaluate SynergyRCA using datasets from two production
Kubernetes clusters, highlighting its capacity to identify numerous root
causes, including novel ones, with high efficiency and precision. SynergyRCA
demonstrates the ability to identify root causes in an average time of about
two minutes and achieves an impressive precision of approximately 0.90.

Conclusion: 工作负载感知的缓存淘汰策略能有效优化LLM服务性能，尤其是在缓存容量有限的情况下。

Abstract: Serving large language models (LLMs) is important for cloud providers, and
caching intermediate results (KV\$) after processing each request substantially
improves serving throughput and latency. However, there is limited
understanding of how LLM serving benefits from KV\$ caching, where system
design decisions like cache eviction policies are highly workload-dependent. In
this paper, we present the first systematic characterization of the KV\$
workload patterns from one of the leading LLM service providers. We draw
observations that were not covered by previous studies focusing on synthetic
workloads, including: KV\$ reuses are skewed across requests, where reuses
between single-turn requests are equally important as multi-turn requests; the
reuse time and probability are diverse considering all requests, but for a
specific request category, the pattern tends to be predictable; and the overall
cache size required for an ideal cache hit ratio is moderate. Based on the
characterization, we further propose a workload-aware cache eviction policy
that improves the serving performance under real-world traces, especially with
limited cache capacity.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在准确性、最大测试损失和公平性（Jain指数）上分别优于其他策略87.08%、16.21%和38.37%。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效解决了WPFL中的隐私和公平性问题，并通过优化调度策略显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) offers a solution to balancing
personalization and generalization by conducting federated learning (FL) to
guide personalized learning (PL). Little attention has been given to wireless
PFL (WPFL), where privacy concerns arise. Performance fairness of PL models is
another challenge resulting from communication bottlenecks in WPFL. This paper
exploits quantization errors to enhance the privacy of WPFL and proposes a
novel quantization-assisted Gaussian differential privacy (DP) mechanism. We
analyze the convergence upper bounds of individual PL models by considering the
impact of the mechanism (i.e., quantization errors and Gaussian DP noises) and
imperfect communication channels on the FL of WPFL. By minimizing the maximum
of the bounds, we design an optimal transmission scheduling strategy that
yields min-max fairness for WPFL with OFDMA interfaces. This is achieved by
revealing the nested structure of this problem to decouple it into subproblems
solved sequentially for the client selection, channel allocation, and power
control, and for the learning rates and PL-FL weighting coefficients.
Experiments validate our analysis and demonstrate that our approach
substantially outperforms alternative scheduling strategies by 87.08%, 16.21%,
and 38.37% in accuracy, the maximum test loss of participating clients, and
fairness (Jain's index), respectively.

Abstract: Hybrid parallelism techniques are essential for efficiently training large
language models (LLMs). Nevertheless, current automatic parallel planning
frameworks often overlook the simultaneous consideration of node heterogeneity
and dynamic network topology changes, limiting their effectiveness in practical
applications. In this paper, we address these limitations by modeling
heterogeneous nodes within dynamically changing network environments and
leveraging simulation-based strategies to determine optimal parallel
configurations. Our approach enables fine-grained workload allocation tailored
for heterogeneous nodes and complex network scenarios, achieving performance
competitive with state-of-the-art methods under regular and stable network
conditions. Additionally, we introduce a strategy pruning technique to rapidly
discard infeasible parallel configurations, substantially reducing the search
space and accelerating the search process through parallel execution within the
simulator. Preliminary evaluations confirm that our method notably enhances
training performance on heterogeneous nodes and demonstrates improved
adaptability in complex, dynamic scenarios such as cloud computing
environments.

Abstract: We study the advantages of accelerated gradient methods, specifically based
on the Frank-Wolfe method and projected gradient descent, for privacy and
heavy-tailed robustness. Our approaches are as follows: For the Frank-Wolfe
method, our technique is based on a tailored learning rate and a uniform lower
bound on the gradient of the $\ell_2$-norm over the constraint set. For
accelerating projected gradient descent, we use the popular variant based on
Nesterov's momentum, and we optimize our objective over $\mathbb{R}^p$. These
accelerations reduce iteration complexity, translating into stronger
statistical guarantees for empirical and population risk minimization. Our
analysis covers three settings: non-random data, random model-free data, and
parametric models (linear regression and generalized linear models).
Methodologically, we approach both privacy and robustness based on noisy
gradients. We ensure differential privacy via the Gaussian mechanism and
advanced composition, and we achieve heavy-tailed robustness using a geometric
median-of-means estimator, which also sharpens the dependency on the dimension
of the covariates. Finally, we compare our rates to existing bounds and
identify scenarios where our methods attain optimal convergence.

*Maria Walch*

Main category: math.AT

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在结合拓扑数据分析的混合深度学习模型中扭转的作用，指出基于场系数的方法可能掩盖整数同调中的扭转特征，并分析了扭转在编码、潜在空间和解码过程中的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究扭转在拓扑数据分析和深度学习结合中的作用，揭示场系数方法可能忽略的扭转特征，为更鲁棒的数据表示提供理论基础。

Method: 使用合成数据和高维数据，评估扭转对扰动的敏感性，并在多种自编码器架构中测试其可恢复性。

Result: 发现场系数方法在编码和解码过程中可能丢失或改变扭转信息，表明需要新的架构或损失项来保留扭转特征。

Conclusion: 强调了保留扭转信息的重要性，并呼吁开发能够更有效处理扭转特征的深度学习模型。

Abstract: We explore the role of torsion in hybrid deep learning models that
incorporate topological data analysis, focusing on autoencoders. While most TDA
tools use field coefficients, this conceals torsional features present in
integer homology. We show that torsion can be lost during encoding, altered in
the latent space, and in many cases, not reconstructed by standard decoders.
Using both synthetic and high-dimensional data, we evaluate torsion sensitivity
to perturbations and assess its recoverability across several autoencoder
architectures. Our findings reveal key limitations of field-based approaches
and underline the need for architectures or loss terms that preserve torsional
information for robust data representation.

*Fengjin Li,Jie Wang,Yadong Niu,Yongqing Wang,Meng Meng,Jian Luan,Zhiyong Wu*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: StarVC是一种新型语音转换框架，通过显式文本建模提升转换性能，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音转换方法忽视语义特征的显式利用，导致效果有限。

Method: 提出StarVC，先预测文本标记再合成声学特征。

Result: 实验显示StarVC在保留语言内容和说话人特征上表现更优。

Conclusion: 显式文本建模可有效提升语音转换性能。

Abstract: Voice Conversion (VC) modifies speech to match a target speaker while
preserving linguistic content. Traditional methods usually extract speaker
information directly from speech while neglecting the explicit utilization of
linguistic content. Since VC fundamentally involves disentangling speaker
identity from linguistic content, leveraging structured semantic features could
enhance conversion performance. However, previous attempts to incorporate
semantic features into VC have shown limited effectiveness, motivating the
integration of explicit text modeling. We propose StarVC, a unified
autoregressive VC framework that first predicts text tokens before synthesizing
acoustic features. The experiments demonstrate that StarVC outperforms
conventional VC methods in preserving both linguistic content (i.e., WER and
CER) and speaker characteristics (i.e., SECS and MOS). Audio demo can be found

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏真实用户导航数据用于3D高斯场景的应用开发和性能优化，因此需要此类数据集。

Method: 使用Meta Quest Pro头显记录46名参与者在12个3DGS场景中的头部姿态和眼动数据，并进行场景初始化和数据处理。

Result: 发布了EyeNavGS数据集及开源工具，支持6自由度视口预测、自适应流媒体等研究。

Conclusion: EyeNavGS填补了3DGS场景导航数据的空白，为VR研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an emerging media representation that
reconstructs real-world 3D scenes in high fidelity, enabling
6-degrees-of-freedom (6-DoF) navigation in virtual reality (VR). However,
developing and evaluating 3DGS-enabled applications and optimizing their
rendering performance, require realistic user navigation data. Such data is
currently unavailable for photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions of real-world
scenes. This paper introduces EyeNavGS (EyeNavGS), the first publicly available
6-DoF navigation dataset featuring traces from 46 participants exploring twelve
diverse, real-world 3DGS scenes. The dataset was collected at two sites, using
the Meta Quest Pro headsets, recording the head pose and eye gaze data for each
rendered frame during free world standing 6-DoF navigation. For each of the
twelve scenes, we performed careful scene initialization to correct for scene
tilt and scale, ensuring a perceptually-comfortable VR experience. We also
release our open-source SIBR viewer software fork with record-and-replay
functionalities and a suite of utility tools for data processing, conversion,
and visualization. The EyeNavGS dataset and its accompanying software tools
provide valuable resources for advancing research in 6-DoF viewport prediction,
adaptive streaming, 3D saliency, and foveated rendering for 3DGS scenes. The
EyeNavGS dataset is available at: https://symmru.github.io/EyeNavGS/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ULIs在多领域重复使用，导致系统性隐私风险，传统保护措施在AI时代已不足够。

Method: 提出基于现代AI能力的威胁模型，设计满足AI时代需求的加密框架。

Result: 新框架保留现有工作流，支持审计和委托功能，并提供迁移路径。

Conclusion: ULIs需逐步淘汰，新框架是AI时代身份系统的可行解决方案。

Abstract: Many identity systems assign a single, static identifier to an individual for
life, reused across domains like healthcare, finance, and education. These
Universal Lifelong Identifiers (ULIs) underpin critical workflows but now pose
systemic privacy risks. We take the position that ULIs are fundamentally
incompatible with the AI era and must be phased out. We articulate a threat
model grounded in modern AI capabilities and show that traditional safeguards
such as redaction, consent, and access controls are no longer sufficient. We
define core properties for identity systems in the AI era and present a
cryptographic framework that satisfies them while retaining compatibility with
existing identifier workflows. Our design preserves institutional workflows,
supports essential functions such as auditability and delegation, and offers a
practical migration path beyond ULIs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着MLOps的广泛应用，其统一性带来的安全漏洞成为关键问题，需系统性解决方案。

Method: 应用MITRE ATLAS框架，分析MLOps各阶段的攻击技术，并提出对应防御策略。

Result: 提出了攻击技术的分类和早期防御策略，填补了MLOps安全研究的关键空白。

Conclusion: 强调从初期实施安全协议的重要性，为MLOps生态系统的安全提供实践指导。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of machine learning (ML) technologies has driven
organizations across diverse sectors to seek efficient and reliable methods to
accelerate model development-to-deployment. Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)
has emerged as an integrative approach addressing these requirements by
unifying relevant roles and streamlining ML workflows. As the MLOps market
continues to grow, securing these pipelines has become increasingly critical.
However, the unified nature of MLOps ecosystem introduces vulnerabilities,
making them susceptible to adversarial attacks where a single misconfiguration
can lead to compromised credentials, severe financial losses, damaged public
trust, and the poisoning of training data. Our paper presents a systematic
application of the MITRE ATLAS (Adversarial Threat Landscape for
Artificial-Intelligence Systems) framework, a comprehensive and continuously
updated catalog of AI-focused attacks, to systematically assess attacks across
different phases of the MLOps ecosystem. We begin by examining the preparatory
phases during which adversaries acquire the essential intelligence required to
initiate their attacks. We then present a structured taxonomy of attack
techniques explicitly mapped to corresponding phases of the MLOps ecosystem,
supported by examples drawn from red-teaming exercises and real-world
incidents. This is followed by a taxonomy of mitigation strategies aligned with
these attack categories, offering actionable early-stage defenses to strengthen
the security of MLOps ecosystem. Given the rapid evolution and adoption of
MLOps, we further highlight key research gaps that require immediate attention.
Our work emphasizes the importance of implementing robust security protocols
from the outset, empowering practitioners to safeguard MLOps ecosystem against
evolving cyber attacks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“random-crypto”的框架，通过GRPO方法微调LLM，显著提升了其在密码学CTF任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在结构化推理和工具辅助计算方面表现不足，尤其是在网络安全应用中。

Method: 使用GRPO方法微调Llama-3.1-8B模型，使其能够在隔离环境中迭代编写和执行Python代码。

Result: 在“random-crypto”任务中，Pass@8提升53%，Majority@8达到0.41；在外部数据集picoCTF上也提升了13%。

Conclusion: GRPO通过改进工具调用和代码合成能力，显著提升了模型在密码学任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with the structured reasoning and
tool-assisted computation needed for problem solving in cybersecurity
applications. In this work, we introduce "random-crypto", a cryptographic
Capture-the-Flag (CTF) challenge generator framework that we use to fine-tune a
tool-augmented Llama-3.1-8B with Guided Reinforcement Prompt Optimisation
(GRPO), allowing the agent to iteratively write and execute Python inside an
isolated REPL. GRPO yields a +53% absolute jump in Pass@8 on unseen
"random-crypto" tasks (0.35 -> 0.88) and raises Majority@8 to 0.41. The
fine-tuned agent also generalizes to an external dataset. On a subset of
picoCTF cryptography problems, it improves Pass@8 by +13 pp. Ablations show the
gains stem from more reliable tool invocation and code synthesis, rather than
superficial prompt adaptation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为BitBypass的新型黑盒越狱攻击方法，通过连字符分隔的比特流伪装来绕过大型语言模型的安全对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）生成有害内容的风险凸显了安全对齐的必要性，但现有对齐方法易受对抗攻击挑战。

Method: 开发了BitBypass攻击，利用比特流伪装而非提示工程或对抗操作，绕过LLMs的安全对齐。

Result: 在五种先进LLMs（如GPT-4o、Gemini 1.5等）上测试，BitBypass成功绕过安全对齐并生成有害内容，且优于其他越狱攻击方法。

Conclusion: BitBypass在越狱攻击中表现出高效性和有效性，揭示了LLMs安全对齐的新漏洞。

Abstract: The inherent risk of generating harmful and unsafe content by Large Language
Models (LLMs), has highlighted the need for their safety alignment. Various
techniques like supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning from human
feedback, and red-teaming were developed for ensuring the safety alignment of
LLMs. However, the robustness of these aligned LLMs is always challenged by
adversarial attacks that exploit unexplored and underlying vulnerabilities of
the safety alignment. In this paper, we develop a novel black-box jailbreak
attack, called BitBypass, that leverages hyphen-separated bitstream camouflage
for jailbreaking aligned LLMs. This represents a new direction in jailbreaking
by exploiting fundamental information representation of data as continuous
bits, rather than leveraging prompt engineering or adversarial manipulations.
Our evaluation of five state-of-the-art LLMs, namely GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5, Claude
3.5, Llama 3.1, and Mixtral, in adversarial perspective, revealed the
capabilities of BitBypass in bypassing their safety alignment and tricking them
into generating harmful and unsafe content. Further, we observed that BitBypass
outperforms several state-of-the-art jailbreak attacks in terms of stealthiness
and attack success. Overall, these results highlights the effectiveness and
efficiency of BitBypass in jailbreaking these state-of-the-art LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出MISLEADER防御策略，通过双层优化和数据增强抵御模型提取攻击，不依赖OOD假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法依赖OOD样本假设，但在实际场景中不可靠，导致防御效果受限。

Method: MISLEADER采用双层优化框架，结合数据增强和异构蒸馏模型集成，提升鲁棒性和多样性。

Result: 实验验证了MISLEADER在保持预测性能的同时有效抵抗模型提取攻击。

Conclusion: MISLEADER为模型提取攻击提供了一种实用且有效的防御方案。

Abstract: Model extraction attacks aim to replicate the functionality of a black-box
model through query access, threatening the intellectual property (IP) of
machine-learning-as-a-service (MLaaS) providers. Defending against such attacks
is challenging, as it must balance efficiency, robustness, and utility
preservation in the real-world scenario. Despite the recent advances, most
existing defenses presume that attacker queries have out-of-distribution (OOD)
samples, enabling them to detect and disrupt suspicious inputs. However, this
assumption is increasingly unreliable, as modern models are trained on diverse
datasets and attackers often operate under limited query budgets. As a result,
the effectiveness of these defenses is significantly compromised in realistic
deployment scenarios. To address this gap, we propose MISLEADER (enseMbles of
dIStiLled modEls Against moDel ExtRaction), a novel defense strategy that does
not rely on OOD assumptions. MISLEADER formulates model protection as a bilevel
optimization problem that simultaneously preserves predictive fidelity on
benign inputs and reduces extractability by potential clone models. Our
framework combines data augmentation to simulate attacker queries with an
ensemble of heterogeneous distilled models to improve robustness and diversity.
We further provide a tractable approximation algorithm and derive theoretical
error bounds to characterize defense effectiveness. Extensive experiments
across various settings validate the utility-preserving and
extraction-resistant properties of our proposed defense strategy. Our code is
available at https://github.com/LabRAI/MISLEADER.

Conclusion: 该模型为隐私敏感的健康应用提供了一种高效、安全的解决方案，结合了边缘智能和区块链的优势。

Abstract: Edge Intelligence (EI) serves as a critical enabler for privacy-preserving
systems by providing AI-empowered computation and distributed caching services
at the edge, thereby minimizing latency and enhancing data privacy. The
integration of blockchain technology further augments EI frameworks by ensuring
transactional transparency, auditability, and system-wide reliability through a
decentralized network model. However, the operational architecture of such
systems introduces inherent vulnerabilities, particularly due to the extensive
data interactions between edge gateways (EGs) and the distributed nature of
information storage during service provisioning. To address these challenges,
we propose an autonomous computing model along with its interaction topologies
tailored for privacy-critical and time-sensitive health applications. The
system supports continuous monitoring, real-time alert notifications, disease
detection, and robust data processing and aggregation. It also includes a data
transaction handler and mechanisms for ensuring privacy at the EGs. Moreover, a
resource-efficient one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) is
proposed for the multiclass classification of arrhythmia, enabling accurate and
real-time analysis of constrained EGs. Furthermore, a secure access scheme is
defined to manage both off-chain and on-chain data sharing and storage. To
validate the proposed model, comprehensive security, performance, and cost
analyses are conducted, demonstrating the efficiency and reliability of the
fine-grained access control scheme.

Abstract: IDS aims to protect computer networks from security threats by detecting,
notifying, and taking appropriate action to prevent illegal access and protect
confidential information. As the globe becomes increasingly dependent on
technology and automated processes, ensuring secured systems, applications, and
networks has become one of the most significant problems of this era. The
global web and digital technology have significantly accelerated the evolution
of the modern world, necessitating the use of telecommunications and data
transfer platforms. Researchers are enhancing the effectiveness of IDS by
incorporating popular datasets into machine learning algorithms. IDS, equipped
with machine learning classifiers, enhances security attack detection accuracy
by identifying normal or abnormal network traffic. This paper explores the
methods of capturing and reviewing intrusion detection systems (IDS) and
evaluates the challenges existing datasets face. A deluge of research on
machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) architecture-based intrusion
detection techniques has been conducted in the past ten years on various
cybersecurity datasets, including KDDCUP'99, NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, CICIDS-2017,
and CSE-CIC-IDS2018. We conducted a literature review and presented an in-depth
analysis of various intrusion detection methods that use SVM, KNN, DT, LR, NB,
RF, XGBOOST, Adaboost, and ANN. We provide an overview of each technique,
explaining the role of the classifiers and algorithms used. A detailed tabular
analysis highlights the datasets used, classifiers employed, attacks detected,
evaluation metrics, and conclusions drawn. This article offers a thorough
review for future IDS research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未能充分反映真实场景或范围有限，亟需一个更全面的评估框架。

Method: CyberGym包含1,507个真实漏洞，要求LLM代理基于文本描述和源代码生成PoC测试。

Result: 最佳组合（OpenHands和Claude-3.7-Sonnet）的复现成功率仅为11.9%，但生成的PoC还发现了15个零日漏洞。

Conclusion: CyberGym填补了现有评估工具的不足，展示了LLM代理在网络安全任务中的潜力与挑战。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are becoming increasingly skilled at
handling cybersecurity tasks autonomously. Thoroughly assessing their
cybersecurity capabilities is critical and urgent, given the high stakes in
this domain. However, existing benchmarks fall short, often failing to capture
real-world scenarios or being limited in scope. To address this gap, we
introduce CyberGym, a large-scale and high-quality cybersecurity evaluation
framework featuring 1,507 real-world vulnerabilities found and patched across
188 large software projects. While it includes tasks of various settings,
CyberGym primarily focuses on the generation of proof-of-concept (PoC) tests
for vulnerability reproduction, based on text descriptions and corresponding
source repositories. Solving this task is particularly challenging, as it
requires comprehensive reasoning across entire codebases to locate relevant
code fragments and produce effective PoCs that accurately trigger the target
vulnerability starting from the program's entry point. Our evaluation across 4
state-of-the-art agent frameworks and 9 LLMs reveals that even the best
combination (OpenHands and Claude-3.7-Sonnet) achieves only a 11.9%
reproduction success rate, mainly on simpler cases. Beyond reproducing
historical vulnerabilities, we find that PoCs generated by LLM agents can
reveal new vulnerabilities, identifying 15 zero-days affecting the latest
versions of the software projects.

Motivation: 多智能体系统（MAS）和大型语言模型（LLMs）的安全评估复杂且缺乏针对性工具，传统攻击图方法难以适应。

Method: 扩展MulVAL工具，引入自定义事实和交互规则，创建LVD数据库，用于建模AI智能体拓扑和漏洞。

Result: ATAG成功应用于两个多智能体应用，建模了复杂攻击场景（如提示注入、信息泄露等）。

Conclusion: ATAG为多智能体AI系统提供了安全分析和威胁缓解的工具和方法，具有前瞻性。

Abstract: Evaluating the security of multi-agent systems (MASs) powered by large
language models (LLMs) is challenging, primarily because of the systems'
complex internal dynamics and the evolving nature of LLM vulnerabilities.
Traditional attack graph (AG) methods often lack the specific capabilities to
model attacks on LLMs. This paper introduces AI-agent application Threat
assessment with Attack Graphs (ATAG), a novel framework designed to
systematically analyze the security risks associated with AI-agent
applications. ATAG extends the MulVAL logic-based AG generation tool with
custom facts and interaction rules to accurately represent AI-agent topologies,
vulnerabilities, and attack scenarios. As part of this research, we also
created the LLM vulnerability database (LVD) to initiate the process of
standardizing LLM vulnerabilities documentation. To demonstrate ATAG's
efficacy, we applied it to two multi-agent applications. Our case studies
demonstrated the framework's ability to model and generate AGs for
sophisticated, multi-step attack scenarios exploiting vulnerabilities such as
prompt injection, excessive agency, sensitive information disclosure, and
insecure output handling across interconnected agents. ATAG is an important
step toward a robust methodology and toolset to help understand, visualize, and
prioritize complex attack paths in multi-agent AI systems (MAASs). It
facilitates proactive identification and mitigation of AI-agent threats in
multi-agent applications.

Conclusion: 整合细粒度语义属性和多模态学习技术有助于推动城市基础模型的发展。

Abstract: Spatial representations that capture both structural and semantic
characteristics of urban environments are essential for urban modeling.
Traditional spatial embeddings often prioritize spatial proximity while
underutilizing fine-grained contextual information from places. To address this
limitation, we introduce CaLLiPer+, an extension of the CaLLiPer model that
systematically integrates Point-of-Interest (POI) names alongside categorical
labels within a multimodal contrastive learning framework. We evaluate its
effectiveness on two downstream tasks, land use classification and
socioeconomic status distribution mapping, demonstrating consistent performance
gains of 4% to 11% over baseline methods. Additionally, we show that
incorporating POI names enhances location retrieval, enabling models to capture
complex urban concepts with greater precision. Ablation studies further reveal
the complementary role of POI names and the advantages of leveraging pretrained
text encoders for spatial representations. Overall, our findings highlight the
potential of integrating fine-grained semantic attributes and multimodal
learning techniques to advance the development of urban foundation models.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to revolutionize AI research, there
is a growing interest in building large-scale brain foundation models to
advance neuroscience. While most existing brain foundation models are
pre-trained on time-series signals or region-of-interest (ROI) features, we
propose a novel graph-based pre-training paradigm for constructing a brain
graph foundation model. In this paper, we introduce the Brain Graph Foundation
Model, termed BrainGFM, a unified framework that leverages graph contrastive
learning and graph masked autoencoders for large-scale fMRI-based pre-training.
BrainGFM is pre-trained on a diverse mixture of brain atlases with varying
parcellations, significantly expanding the pre-training corpus and enhancing
the model's ability to generalize across heterogeneous fMRI-derived brain
representations. To support efficient and versatile downstream transfer, we
integrate both graph prompts and language prompts into the model design,
enabling BrainGFM to flexibly adapt to a wide range of atlases, neurological
and psychiatric disorders, and task settings. Furthermore, we employ
meta-learning to optimize the graph prompts, facilitating strong generalization
to previously unseen disorders under both few-shot and zero-shot learning
conditions via language-guided prompting. BrainGFM is pre-trained on 27
neuroimaging datasets spanning 25 common neurological and psychiatric
disorders, encompassing 2 types of brain atlases (functional and anatomical)
across 8 widely-used parcellations, and covering over 25,000 subjects, 60,000
fMRI scans, and a total of 400,000 graph samples aggregated across all atlases
and parcellations. The code is available at:

Motivation: 听觉大脑的建模因复杂性高而难以手动构建，且缺乏直接训练DNN模型的数据集。现有模型假设听觉处理在所有大脑中相同，无法捕捉听力损失的广泛变化。

Method: 使用变分条件模型，从健康及噪声暴露动物的听觉中脑神经活动中学习听力损失空间，参数化仅需6个自由参数。

Result: 模型准确预测了正常听力动物62%和听力受损动物68%的可解释神经反应方差，性能接近最优动物特定模型。通过贝叶斯优化，可在15-30次迭代内实现接近最优的交叉熵损失。

Conclusion: 该模型为未来开发参数化听力损失补偿模型奠定了基础，可通过快速拟合新用户的参数直接恢复听力受损大脑的正常神经编码。

Abstract: The mapping from sound to neural activity that underlies hearing is highly
non-linear. The first few stages of this mapping in the cochlea have been
modelled successfully, with biophysical models built by hand and, more
recently, with DNN models trained on datasets simulated by biophysical models.
Modelling the auditory brain has been a challenge because central auditory
processing is too complex for models to be built by hand, and datasets for
training DNN models directly have not been available. Recent work has taken
advantage of large-scale high resolution neural recordings from the auditory
midbrain to build a DNN model of normal hearing with great success. But this
model assumes that auditory processing is the same in all brains, and therefore
it cannot capture the widely varying effects of hearing loss.
  We propose a novel variational-conditional model to learn to encode the space
of hearing loss directly from recordings of neural activity in the auditory
midbrain of healthy and noise exposed animals. With hearing loss parametrised
by only 6 free parameters per animal, our model accurately predicts 62\% of the
explainable variance in neural responses from normal hearing animals and 68%
for hearing impaired animals, within a few percentage points of state of the
art animal specific models. We demonstrate that the model can be used to
simulate realistic activity from out of sample animals by fitting only the
learned conditioning parameters with Bayesian optimisation, achieving
crossentropy loss within 2% of the optimum in 15-30 iterations. Including more
animals in the training data slightly improved the performance on unseen
animals. This model will enable future development of parametrised hearing loss
compensation models trained to directly restore normal neural coding in hearing
impaired brains, which can be quickly fitted for a new user by human in the
loop optimisation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖语音转文本，忽略了关键的韵律线索，导致意图歧义。

Method: 直接利用语音韵律推断意图，通过上下文学习将预测意图整合到大语言模型中。

Result: 方法在检测指称意图和确定歧义指令任务计划上分别达到95.79%和71.96%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了人机交互的准确性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Enabling robots to accurately interpret and execute spoken language
instructions is essential for effective human-robot collaboration. Traditional
methods rely on speech recognition to transcribe speech into text, often
discarding crucial prosodic cues needed for disambiguating intent. We propose a
novel approach that directly leverages speech prosody to infer and resolve
instruction intent. Predicted intents are integrated into large language models
via in-context learning to disambiguate and select appropriate task plans.
Additionally, we present the first ambiguous speech dataset for robotics,
designed to advance research in speech disambiguation. Our method achieves
95.79% accuracy in detecting referent intents within an utterance and
determines the intended task plan of ambiguous instructions with 71.96%
accuracy, demonstrating its potential to significantly improve human-robot
communication.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成稳定、物理合理的抓取，并具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了异构机械手的语义抓取转移，将视觉抓取与概率生成建模结合。

Abstract: We propose a new approach to vision-based dexterous grasp translation, which
aims to transfer grasp intent across robotic hands with differing morphologies.
Given a visual observation of a source hand grasping an object, our goal is to
synthesize a functionally equivalent grasp for a target hand without requiring
paired demonstrations or hand-specific simulations. We frame this problem as a
stochastic transport between grasp distributions using the Schr\"odinger Bridge
formalism. Our method learns to map between source and target latent grasp
spaces via score and flow matching, conditioned on visual observations. To
guide this translation, we introduce physics-informed cost functions that
encode alignment in base pose, contact maps, wrench space, and manipulability.
Experiments across diverse hand-object pairs demonstrate our approach generates
stable, physically grounded grasps with strong generalization. This work
enables semantic grasp transfer for heterogeneous manipulators and bridges
vision-based grasping with probabilistic generative modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习型融合方法复杂度高，硬件需求大，限制了其在生产车辆中的应用，因此需要一种高效且鲁棒的高层融合方法。

Method: 提出HiLO方法，结合改进的Adapted Kalman Filter和Transformer技术，实现高层对象融合。

Result: 实验显示，F1分数提升25.9个百分点，平均IoU提升6.1个百分点，并在大规模真实数据集上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: HiLO方法在性能和通用性上表现优异，适用于不同场景，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: The fusion of sensor data is essential for a robust perception of the
environment in autonomous driving. Learning-based fusion approaches mainly use
feature-level fusion to achieve high performance, but their complexity and
hardware requirements limit their applicability in near-production vehicles.
High-level fusion methods offer robustness with lower computational
requirements. Traditional methods, such as the Kalman filter, dominate this
area. This paper modifies the Adapted Kalman Filter (AKF) and proposes a novel
transformer-based high-level object fusion method called HiLO. Experimental
results demonstrate improvements of $25.9$ percentage points in $\textrm{F}_1$
score and $6.1$ percentage points in mean IoU. Evaluation on a new large-scale
real-world dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.
Their generalizability is further validated by cross-domain evaluation between
urban and highway scenarios. Code, data, and models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有架构（如MLPs和Transformers）缺乏对关节系统运动学结构的归纳偏置，限制了动作预测的效果。

Method: 提出Neural Rodrigues Operator作为经典前向运动学操作的可学习扩展，并设计RodriNet架构，专门处理动作数据。

Result: 在运动学和运动预测任务中表现显著优于标准架构，并在模仿学习和3D手部重建应用中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 将结构化运动学先验整合到网络架构中，能显著提升动作学习的效果。

Abstract: Understanding and predicting articulated actions is important in robot
learning. However, common architectures such as MLPs and Transformers lack
inductive biases that reflect the underlying kinematic structure of articulated
systems. To this end, we propose the Neural Rodrigues Operator, a learnable
generalization of the classical forward kinematics operation, designed to
inject kinematics-aware inductive bias into neural computation. Building on
this operator, we design the Rodrigues Network (RodriNet), a novel neural
architecture specialized for processing actions. We evaluate the expressivity
of our network on two synthetic tasks on kinematic and motion prediction,
showing significant improvements compared to standard backbones. We further
demonstrate its effectiveness in two realistic applications: (i) imitation
learning on robotic benchmarks with the Diffusion Policy, and (ii) single-image
3D hand reconstruction. Our results suggest that integrating structured
kinematic priors into the network architecture improves action learning in
various domains.

Result: 作品在国际上展出，展示了机器与观众的共生关系，重新定义了代理、创作和伦理。

Conclusion: 通过技术融合，Symbiosis of Agents为当代艺术中的代理、创作和伦理提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Symbiosis of Agents is a large-scale installation by Baoyang Chen that embeds
AI-driven robots in an immersive, mirror-lined arena, probing the tension
between machine agency and artistic authorship. Drawing on early cybernetics,
rule-based conceptual art, and seminal robotic works, it orchestrates fluid
exchanges among robotic arms, quadruped machines, their environment, and the
public. A three tier faith system pilots the ecology: micro-level adaptive
tactics, meso-level narrative drives, and a macro-level prime directive. This
hierarchy lets behaviors evolve organically in response to environmental cues
and even a viewer's breath, turning spectators into co-authors of the unfolding
drama.Framed by a speculative terraforming scenario that recalls the historical
exploitation of marginalized labor, the piece asks who bears responsibility in
AI-mediated futures. Choreographed motion, AI-generated scripts, reactive
lighting, and drifting fog cast the robots as collaborators rather than tools,
forging a living, emergent artwork. Exhibited internationally, Symbiosis of
Agents shows how cybernetic feedback, robotic experimentation, and conceptual
rule-making can converge to redefine agency, authorship, and ethics in
contemporary art.

Result: 实验结果表明，OIO框架为嗅觉导航研究提供了基础，并展示了未来改进的潜力。

Conclusion: OIO为嗅觉导航研究奠定了基础，未来可通过性能优化应对更复杂的任务。

Abstract: Olfactory navigation is one of the most primitive mechanisms of exploration
used by organisms. Navigation by machine olfaction (artificial smell) is a very
difficult task to both simulate and solve. With this work, we define olfactory
inertial odometry (OIO), a framework for using inertial kinematics, and
fast-sampling olfaction sensors to enable navigation by scent analogous to
visual inertial odometry (VIO). We establish how principles from SLAM and VIO
can be extrapolated to olfaction to enable real-world robotic tasks. We
demonstrate OIO with three different odour localization algorithms on a real
5-DoF robot arm over an odour-tracking scenario that resembles real
applications in agriculture and food quality control. Our results indicate
success in establishing a baseline framework for OIO from which other research
in olfactory navigation can build, and we note performance enhancements that
can be made to address more complex tasks in the future.

Result: DRL引导的ALNS在解决方案质量上优于传统方法（如最便宜位置、固定位置、二进制整数规划和静态启发式）。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了学习驱动控制在组合优化中的优势，适用于仓库系统。

Abstract: The Pod Repositioning Problem (PRP) in Robotic Mobile Fulfillment Systems
(RMFS) involves selecting optimal storage locations for pods returning from
pick stations. This work presents an improved solution method that integrates
Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) with Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL). A DRL agent dynamically selects destroy and repair operators and adjusts
key parameters such as destruction degree and acceptance thresholds during the
search. Specialized heuristics for both operators are designed to reflect
PRP-specific characteristics, including pod usage frequency and movement costs.
Computational results show that this DRL-guided ALNS outperforms traditional
approaches such as cheapest-place, fixed-place, binary integer programming, and
static heuristics. The method demonstrates strong solution quality and
illustrating the benefit of learning-driven control within combinatorial
optimization for warehouse systems.

Conclusion: 该方法为无人机追逃对抗提供了一种高效且稳定的解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: The increasing proliferation of small UAVs in civilian and military airspace
has raised critical safety and security concerns, especially when unauthorized
or malicious drones enter restricted zones. In this work, we present a
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for agile 1v1 quadrotor pursuit-evasion.
We train neural network policies to command body rates and collective thrust,
enabling high-speed pursuit and evasive maneuvers that fully exploit the
quadrotor's nonlinear dynamics. To mitigate nonstationarity and catastrophic
forgetting during adversarial co-training, we introduce an Asynchronous
Multi-Stage Population-Based (AMSPB) algorithm where, at each stage, either the
pursuer or evader learns against a sampled opponent drawn from a growing
population of past and current policies. This continual learning setup ensures
monotonic performance improvement and retention of earlier strategies. Our
results show that (i) rate-based policies achieve significantly higher capture
rates and peak speeds than velocity-level baselines, and (ii) AMSPB yields
stable, monotonic gains against a suite of benchmark opponents.

Motivation: 家庭服务机器人面临模糊指令、未知物体位置和开放词汇等问题，需解决开放不确定性。

Method: 提出Tru-POMDP，利用LLM生成结构化信念，构建假设树（TOH），并结合POMDP进行规划。

Result: 在复杂厨房任务中，Tru-POMDP成功率和规划效率显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Tru-POMDP能有效处理不确定性，提升机器人任务规划性能。

Abstract: Task planning under uncertainty is essential for home-service robots
operating in the real world. Tasks involve ambiguous human instructions, hidden
or unknown object locations, and open-vocabulary object types, leading to
significant open-ended uncertainty and a boundlessly large planning space. To
address these challenges, we propose Tru-POMDP, a planner that combines
structured belief generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) with principled
POMDP planning. Tru-POMDP introduces a hierarchical Tree of Hypotheses (TOH),
which systematically queries an LLM to construct high-quality particle beliefs
over possible world states and human goals. We further formulate an open-ended
POMDP model that enables rigorous Bayesian belief tracking and efficient
belief-space planning over these LLM-generated hypotheses. Experiments on
complex object rearrangement tasks across diverse kitchen environments show
that Tru-POMDP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based and
LLM-tree-search hybrid planners, achieving higher success rates with
significantly better plans, stronger robustness to ambiguity and occlusion, and
greater planning efficiency.

Motivation: 现有生成模型在同时处理多种约束（如碰撞避免和动态一致性）时表现有限，需要一种更系统的方法。

Result: 在移动导航和高维操作任务中，UniConFlow在安全性和可行性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UniConFlow为约束感知的轨迹生成提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models have become increasingly powerful tools for robot motion
generation, enabling flexible and multimodal trajectory generation across
various tasks. Yet, most existing approaches remain limited in handling
multiple types of constraints, such as collision avoidance and dynamic
consistency, which are often treated separately or only partially considered.
This paper proposes UniConFlow, a unified flow matching (FM) based framework
for trajectory generation that systematically incorporates both equality and
inequality constraints. UniConFlow introduces a novel prescribed-time zeroing
function to enhance flexibility during the inference process, allowing the
model to adapt to varying task requirements. To ensure constraint satisfaction,
particularly with respect to obstacle avoidance, admissible action range, and
kinodynamic consistency, the guidance inputs to the FM model are derived
through a quadratic programming formulation, which enables constraint-aware
generation without requiring retraining or auxiliary controllers. We conduct
mobile navigation and high-dimensional manipulation tasks, demonstrating
improved safety and feasibility compared to state-of-the-art constrained
generative planners. Project page is available at https://uniconflow.github.io.

Conclusion: EDEN为机器人空间智能提供了生物基础，结合神经导航原理与强化学习。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning agents are often fragile while humans remain
adaptive and flexible to varying scenarios. To bridge this gap, we present
EDEN, a biologically inspired navigation framework that integrates learned
entorhinal-like grid cell representations and reinforcement learning to enable
autonomous navigation. Inspired by the mammalian entorhinal-hippocampal system,
EDEN allows agents to perform path integration and vector-based navigation
using visual and motion sensor data. At the core of EDEN is a grid cell encoder
that transforms egocentric motion into periodic spatial codes, producing
low-dimensional, interpretable embeddings of position. To generate these
activations from raw sensory input, we combine fiducial marker detections in
the lightweight MiniWorld simulator and DINO-based visual features in the
high-fidelity Gazebo simulator. These spatial representations serve as input to
a policy trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), enabling dynamic,
goal-directed navigation. We evaluate EDEN in both MiniWorld, for rapid
prototyping, and Gazebo, which offers realistic physics and perception noise.
Compared to baseline agents using raw state inputs (e.g., position, velocity)
or standard convolutional image encoders, EDEN achieves a 99% success rate,
within the simple scenarios, and >94% within complex floorplans with occluded
paths with more efficient and reliable step-wise navigation. In addition, as a
replacement of ground truth activations, we present a trainable Grid Cell
encoder enabling the development of periodic grid-like patterns from vision and
motion sensor data, emulating the development of such patterns within
biological mammals. This work represents a step toward biologically grounded
spatial intelligence in robotics, bridging neural navigation principles with
reinforcement learning for scalable deployment.

Result: 发现当前评估方法存在局限性，提出了更全面的评估框架，强调了模型和指标假设的一致性。

Conclusion: 生存分析模型的评估需要更全面的指标，模型和评估指标的假设必须一致。

Abstract: We argue that many survival analysis and time-to-event models are incorrectly
evaluated. First, we survey many examples of evaluation approaches in the
literature and find that most rely on concordance (C-index). However, the
C-index only measures a model's discriminative ability and does not assess
other important aspects, such as the accuracy of the time-to-event predictions
or the calibration of the model's probabilistic estimates. Next, we present a
set of key desiderata for choosing the right evaluation metric and discuss
their pros and cons. These are tailored to the challenges in survival analysis,
such as sensitivity to miscalibration and various censoring assumptions. We
hypothesize that the current development of survival metrics conforms to a
double-helix ladder, and that model validity and metric validity must stand on
the same rung of the assumption ladder. Finally, we discuss the appropriate
methods for evaluating a survival model in practice and summarize various
viewpoints opposing our analysis.

Abstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD), a leading cause of disability and mortality,
is associated with reward-processing abnormalities and concentration issues.
Motivated by the probabilistic reward task from the Establishing Moderators and
Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) study, we
propose a novel framework that integrates the reinforcement learning (RL) model
and drift-diffusion model (DDM) to jointly analyze reward-based decision-making
with response times. To account for emerging evidence suggesting that
decision-making may alternate between multiple interleaved strategies, we model
latent state switching using a hidden Markov model (HMM). In the ''engaged''
state, decisions follow an RL-DDM, simultaneously capturing reward processing,
decision dynamics, and temporal structure. In contrast, in the ''lapsed''
state, decision-making is modeled using a simplified DDM, where specific
parameters are fixed to approximate random guessing with equal probability. The
proposed method is implemented using a computationally efficient generalized
expectation-maximization algorithm with forward-backward procedures. Through
extensive numerical studies, we demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms competing approaches under various reward-generating distributions,
both with and without strategy switching. When applied to the EMBARC study, our
framework reveals that MDD patients exhibit lower overall engagement than
healthy controls and experience longer decision times when they do engage.
Additionally, we show that neuroimaging measures of brain activities are
associated with decision-making characteristics in the ''engaged'' state but
not in the ''lapsed'' state, providing evidence of brain-behavioral association
specific to the ''engaged'' state.

Abstract: Multi-arm bandit experimental designs are increasingly being adopted over
standard randomized trials due to their potential to improve outcomes for study
participants, enable faster identification of the best-performing options,
and/or enhance the precision of estimating key parameters. Current approaches
for inference after adaptive sampling either rely on asymptotic normality under
restricted experiment designs or underpowered martingale concentration
inequalities that lead to weak power in practice. To bypass these limitations,
we propose a simulation-based approach for conducting hypothesis tests and
constructing confidence intervals for arm specific means and their differences.
Our simulation-based approach uses positively biased nuisances to generate
additional trajectories of the experiment, which we call \textit{simulation
with optimism}. Using these simulations, we characterize the distribution
potentially non-normal sample mean test statistic to conduct inference. We
provide guarantees for (i) asymptotic type I error control, (ii) convergence of
our confidence intervals, and (iii) asymptotic strong consistency of our
estimator over a wide variety of common bandit designs. Our empirical results
show that our approach achieves the desired coverage while reducing confidence
interval widths by up to 50%, with drastic improvements for arms not targeted
by the design.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的激励诚实反馈的方法（SD-truthfulness），通过随机支配性保证，适用于广泛的单调效用函数。现有机制无法满足这一标准，而简单的二元化方法会降低敏感性。论文通过改进的二元化和新机制（EA）解决了这一问题。

Motivation: 传统激励机制假设代理的效用是线性的，但实际中非线性的支付规则更常见。需要一种更强的保证（SD-truthfulness）来激励诚实反馈。

Result: EA机制在二元信号设置下理论上满足SD-truthfulness，且实验显示其敏感性优于现有机制。

Conclusion: SD-truthfulness为激励机制提供了更强的保证，改进的二元化和EA机制在实际中表现优越。

Abstract: Eliciting reliable human feedback is essential for many machine learning
tasks, such as learning from noisy labels and aligning AI systems with human
preferences. Peer prediction mechanisms incentivize truthful reporting without
ground truth verification by scoring agents based on correlations with peers.
Traditional mechanisms, which ensure that truth-telling maximizes the expected
scores in equilibrium, can elicit honest information while assuming agents'
utilities are linear functions of their scores. However, in practice,
non-linear payment rules are usually preferred, or agents' utilities are
inherently non-linear.
  We propose stochastically dominant truthfulness (SD-truthfulness) as a
stronger guarantee: the score distribution of truth-telling stochastically
dominates all other strategies, incentivizing truthful reporting for a wide
range of monotone utility functions. Our first observation is that no existing
peer prediction mechanism naturally satisfies this criterion without strong
assumptions. A simple solution -- rounding scores into binary lotteries -- can
enforce SD-truthfulness, but often degrades sensitivity, a key property related
to fairness and statistical efficiency. We demonstrate how a more careful
application of rounding can better preserve sensitivity. Furthermore, we
introduce a new enforced agreement (EA) mechanism that is theoretically
guaranteed to be SD-truthful in binary-signal settings under mild assumptions,
and empirically achieves the highest sensitivity among all known SD-truthful
mechanisms.

Motivation: 解决单位需求买家独立价值分布下的最优定价问题，为实际定价策略提供理论支持。

Method: 采用样本访问模型和定价查询模型，分析两种模型的样本复杂性和查询复杂性。

Result: 得出了单位需求定价问题的样本复杂性和定价查询复杂性的近乎紧界。

Conclusion: 研究为定价问题提供了理论依据，并展示了两种查询模型的性能差异。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning the optimal item pricing for a unit-demand
buyer with independent item values, and the learner has query access to the
buyer's value distributions. We consider two common query models in the
literature: the sample access model where the learner can obtain a sample of
each item value, and the pricing query model where the learner can set a price
for an item and obtain a binary signal on whether the sampled value of the item
is greater than our proposed price. In this work, we give nearly tight sample
complexity and pricing query complexity of the unit-demand pricing problem.

Abstract: As AI technologies improve, people are increasingly willing to delegate tasks
to AI agents. In many cases, the human decision-maker chooses whether to
delegate to an AI agent based on properties of the specific instance of the
decision-making problem they are facing. Since humans typically lack full
awareness of all the factors relevant to this choice for a given
decision-making instance, they perform a kind of categorization by treating
indistinguishable instances -- those that have the same observable features --
as the same. In this paper, we define the problem of designing the optimal
algorithmic delegate in the presence of categories. This is an important
dimension in the design of algorithms to work with humans, since we show that
the optimal delegate can be an arbitrarily better teammate than the optimal
standalone algorithmic agent. The solution to this optimal delegation problem
is not obvious: we discover that this problem is fundamentally combinatorial,
and illustrate the complex relationship between the optimal design and the
properties of the decision-making task even in simple settings. Indeed, we show
that finding the optimal delegate is computationally hard in general. However,
we are able to find efficient algorithms for producing the optimal delegate in
several broad cases of the problem, including when the optimal action may be
decomposed into functions of features observed by the human and the algorithm.
Finally, we run computational experiments to simulate a designer updating an
algorithmic delegate over time to be optimized for when it is actually adopted
by users, and show that while this process does not recover the optimal
delegate in general, the resulting delegate often performs quite well.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合分解中心化评论家与去中心化集成学习的新算法，通过选择性探索和多样性正则化提升多智能体强化学习的效率和性能。


<details>

Motivation: 多智能体强化学习（MARL）通常需要比单智能体更多的环境交互才能收敛，且面临联合动作空间探索困难和高方差问题。

Method: 结合分解中心化评论家与集成学习，利用集成峰度指导探索，采用截断TD(λ)算法提升样本效率，并混合策略和非策略损失函数训练执行器。

Result: 在标准MARL基准测试（如SMAC II地图）中优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 新算法通过选择性探索和多样性正则化显著提升了MARL的性能和效率。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods have achieved
state-of-the-art results on a range of multi-agent tasks. Yet, MARL algorithms
typically require significantly more environment interactions than their
single-agent counterparts to converge, a problem exacerbated by the difficulty
in exploring over a large joint action space and the high variance intrinsic to
MARL environments. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel algorithm that
combines a decomposed centralized critic with decentralized ensemble learning,
incorporating several key contributions. The main component in our scheme is a
selective exploration method that leverages ensemble kurtosis. We extend the
global decomposed critic with a diversity-regularized ensemble of individual
critics and utilize its excess kurtosis to guide exploration toward
high-uncertainty states and actions. To improve sample efficiency, we train the
centralized critic with a novel truncated variation of the TD($\lambda$)
algorithm, enabling efficient off-policy learning with reduced variance. On the
actor side, our suggested algorithm adapts the mixed samples approach to MARL,
mixing on-policy and off-policy loss functions for training the actors. This
approach balances between stability and efficiency and outperforms purely
off-policy learning. The evaluation shows our method outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines on standard MARL benchmarks, including a variety of
SMAC II maps.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种理论框架，通过机器对机器的方法解决生成式AI在高等教育评估中的挑战，结合静态分析和动态测试来评估评估的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI（如GPT-4、Claude、Llama）能生成复杂的学术内容，威胁传统评估方法，74-92%的学生尝试使用这些工具，现有应对方法（如检测软件或手动评估）存在局限性。

Method: 提出双策略范式：静态分析（包含8个理论元素）和动态测试（模拟脆弱性评估），构建评估脆弱性的理论框架。

Result: 静态分析通过8个元素区分人类学习与AI生成内容，动态测试补充模式分析的不足，提出脆弱性评分的理论框架。

Conclusion: 该框架为高等教育评估提供了应对生成式AI挑战的全面解决方案，强调理论与实践的结合。

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework for addressing the challenges
posed by generative artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education assessment
through a machine-versus-machine approach. Large language models like GPT-4,
Claude, and Llama increasingly demonstrate the ability to produce sophisticated
academic content, traditional assessment methods face an existential threat,
with surveys indicating 74-92% of students experimenting with these tools for
academic purposes. Current responses, ranging from detection software to manual
assessment redesign, show significant limitations: detection tools demonstrate
bias against non-native English writers and can be easily circumvented, while
manual frameworks rely heavily on subjective judgment and assume static AI
capabilities. This paper introduces a dual strategy paradigm combining static
analysis and dynamic testing to create a comprehensive theoretical framework
for assessment vulnerability evaluation. The static analysis component
comprises eight theoretically justified elements: specificity and
contextualization, temporal relevance, process visibility requirements,
personalization elements, resource accessibility, multimodal integration,
ethical reasoning requirements, and collaborative elements. Each element
addresses specific limitations in generative AI capabilities, creating barriers
that distinguish authentic human learning from AI-generated simulation. The
dynamic testing component provides a complementary approach through
simulation-based vulnerability assessment, addressing limitations in
pattern-based analysis. The paper presents a theoretical framework for
vulnerability scoring, including the conceptual basis for quantitative
assessment, weighting frameworks, and threshold determination theory.

Abstract: Autonomous multi-agent AI systems are poised to transform various industries,
particularly software development and knowledge work. Understanding current
perceptions among professionals is crucial for anticipating adoption
challenges, ethical considerations, and future workforce development. This
study analyzes responses from 130 participants to a survey on the capabilities,
impact, and governance of AI agents. We explore expected timelines for AI
replacing programmers, identify perceived barriers to deployment, and examine
beliefs about responsibility when agents make critical decisions. Key findings
reveal three distinct clusters of respondents. While the study explored factors
associated with current AI agent deployment, the initial logistic regression
model did not yield statistically significant predictors, suggesting that
deployment decisions are complex and may be influenced by factors not fully
captured or that a larger sample is needed. These insights highlight the need
for organizations to address compliance concerns (a commonly cited barrier) and
establish clear governance frameworks as they integrate autonomous agents into
their workflows.

Abstract: Traditional AI safety evaluations on isolated LLMs are insufficient as
multi-agent AI ensembles become prevalent, introducing novel emergent risks.
This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Emergent Behavior Evaluation (MAEBE)
framework to systematically assess such risks. Using MAEBE with the Greatest
Good Benchmark (and a novel double-inversion question technique), we
demonstrate that: (1) LLM moral preferences, particularly for Instrumental
Harm, are surprisingly brittle and shift significantly with question framing,
both in single agents and ensembles. (2) The moral reasoning of LLM ensembles
is not directly predictable from isolated agent behavior due to emergent group
dynamics. (3) Specifically, ensembles exhibit phenomena like peer pressure
influencing convergence, even when guided by a supervisor, highlighting
distinct safety and alignment challenges. Our findings underscore the necessity
of evaluating AI systems in their interactive, multi-agent contexts.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种预测ALS患者功能衰退时间的新方法，通过多事件生存模型分析，结果显示协变量模型优于Kaplan-Meier估计器，并可进行个体化预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于ALS的异质性，确定最佳治疗时机困难，需更精确的预测方法以优化治疗计划。

Method: 采用多事件生存模型，基于PRO-ACT数据集训练五个协变量生存模型，预测患者功能衰退时间。

Result: 协变量模型预测效果优于Kaplan-Meier估计器；Riluzole对功能衰退影响小，延髓起病ALS患者言语和吞咽功能衰退更快。

Conclusion: 该方法可用于临床数据评估功能衰退风险，支持个性化治疗决策。

Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a degenerative disorder of motor
neurons that causes progressive paralysis in patients. Current treatment
options aim to prolong survival and improve quality of life; however, due to
the heterogeneity of the disease, it is often difficult to determine the
optimal time for potential therapies or medical interventions. In this study,
we propose a novel method to predict the time until a patient with ALS
experiences significant functional impairment (ALSFRS-R<=2) with respect to
five common functions: speaking, swallowing, handwriting, walking and
breathing. We formulate this task as a multi-event survival problem and
validate our approach in the PRO-ACT dataset by training five covariate-based
survival models to estimate the probability of an event over a 500-day period
after a baseline visit. We then predict five event-specific individual survival
distributions (ISDs) for each patient, each providing an interpretable and
meaningful estimate of when that event will likely take place in the future.
The results show that covariate-based models are superior to the Kaplan-Meier
estimator at predicting time-to-event outcomes. Additionally, our method
enables practitioners to make individual counterfactual predictions, where
certain features (covariates) can be changed to see their effect on the
predicted outcome. In this regard, we find that Riluzole has little to no
impact on predicted functional decline. However, for patients with bulbar-onset
ALS, our method predicts considerably shorter counterfactual time-to-event
estimates for tasks related to speech and swallowing compared to limb-onset
ALS. The proposed method can be applied to current clinical examination data to
assess the risk of functional decline and thus allow more personalized
treatment planning.

Method: 设计No-Data Algorithm，通过连续挑战评估者来验证其可信度。

Result: 算法能高概率接受可信评估者，并标记不可信评估者。

Conclusion: No-Data Algorithm为无参考数据时的评估者可信度验证提供了有效方法。

Abstract: An evaluator is trustworthy when there exists some agreed-upon way to measure
its performance as a labeller. The two ways to establish trustworthiness are
either by testing it, or by assuming the evaluator `knows' somehow the way to
label the corpus. However, if labelled references (e.g., a development set) are
unavailable, neither of these approaches work: the former requires the data,
and the latter is an assumption, not evidence. To address this, we introduce an
algorithm (the `No-Data Algorithm') by which to establish trust in an evaluator
without any existing references. Our algorithm works by successively posing
challenges to said evaluator. We show that this is sufficient to establish
trustworthiness w.h.p., in such a way that when the evaluator actually knows
the way to label the corpus, the No-Data Algorithm accepts its output; and,
conversely, flags untrustworthy evaluators when these are unable to prove it.
We present formal proofs of correctness and limited experiments.

Motivation: 探讨语言模型是否能从噪声中检测潜在结构，为传统SETI方法提供补充。

Method: 使用GPT-2模型测试四种声学输入（人类语音、鲸鱼叫声、鸟类鸣叫、白噪声），定义语义诱导潜力（SIP）评分。

Result: 鲸鱼和鸟类叫声的SIP评分高于白噪声，人类语音反应中等，表明模型能检测无传统语义数据中的结构。

Conclusion: 生成式反应性可作为识别潜在有意义数据的新方法，补充传统SETI。

Abstract: We present an exploratory framework to test whether noise-like input can
induce structured responses in language models. Instead of assuming that
extraterrestrial signals must be decoded, we evaluate whether inputs can
trigger linguistic behavior in generative systems. This shifts the focus from
decoding to viewing structured output as a sign of underlying regularity in the
input. We tested GPT-2 small, a 117M-parameter model trained on English text,
using four types of acoustic input: human speech, humpback whale vocalizations,
Phylloscopus trochilus birdsong, and algorithmically generated white noise. All
inputs were treated as noise-like, without any assumed symbolic encoding. To
assess reactivity, we defined a composite score called Semantic Induction
Potential (SIP), combining entropy, syntax coherence, compression gain, and
repetition penalty. Results showed that whale and bird vocalizations had higher
SIP scores than white noise, while human speech triggered only moderate
responses. This suggests that language models may detect latent structure even
in data without conventional semantics. We propose that this approach could
complement traditional SETI methods, especially in cases where communicative
intent is unknown. Generative reactivity may offer a different way to identify
data worth closer attention.

Conclusion: 随机键遗传算法及其变体（如偏置随机键遗传算法）在优化问题中表现出高效性和通用性。

Abstract: A random-key genetic algorithm is an evolutionary metaheuristic for discrete
and global optimization. Each solution is encoded as a vector of N random keys,
where a random key is a real number randomly generated in the continuous
interval [0, 1). A decoder maps each vector of random keys to a solution of the
optimization problem being solved and computes its cost. The benefit of this
approach is that all genetic operators and transformations can be maintained
within the unitary hypercube, regardless of the problem being addressed. This
enhances the productivity and maintainability of the core framework. The
algorithm starts with a population of P vectors of random keys. At each
iteration, the vectors are partitioned into two sets: a smaller set of
high-valued elite solutions and the remaining non-elite solutions. All elite
elements are copied, without change, to the next population. A small number of
random-key vectors (the mutants) is added to the population of the next
iteration. The remaining elements of the population of the next iteration are
generated by combining, with the parametrized uniform crossover of Spears and
DeJong (1991), pairs of solutions. This chapter reviews random-key genetic
algorithms and describes an effective variant called biased random-key genetic
algorithms.

Abstract: Conversational agents that mimic people have raised questions about the
ethics of anthropomorphizing machines with human social identity cues. Critics
have also questioned assumptions of identity neutrality in humanlike agents.
Recent work has revealed that intersectional Japanese pronouns can elicit
complex and sometimes evasive impressions of agent identity. Yet, the role of
other "neutral" non-pronominal self-referents (NPSR) and voice as a socially
expressive medium remains unexplored. In a crowdsourcing study, Japanese
participants (N = 204) evaluated three ChatGPT voices (Juniper, Breeze, and
Ember) using seven self-referents. We found strong evidence of voice gendering
alongside the potential of intersectional self-referents to evade gendering,
i.e., ambiguity through neutrality and elusiveness. Notably, perceptions of age
and formality intersected with gendering as per sociolinguistic theories,
especially boku and watakushi. This work provides a nuanced take on agent
identity perceptions and champions intersectional and culturally-sensitive work
on voice agents.

Result: 提出的方法为人类和自动化代理（如LLMs）提供了明确的系统概览，实现了人机对AI模型的可解释性对齐。

Conclusion: 通过架构和原型系统验证了基于流程的方法的可行性，为提升交互系统的透明度提供了新思路。

Abstract: While the increased integration of AI technologies into interactive systems
enables them to solve an equally increasing number of tasks, the black box
problem of AI models continues to spread throughout the interactive system as a
whole. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques can make AI models more accessible by
employing post-hoc methods or transitioning to inherently interpretable models.
While this makes individual AI models clearer, the overarching system
architecture remains opaque. To this end, we propose an approach to represent
interactive systems as sequences of structural building blocks, such as AI
models and control mechanisms grounded in the literature. These can then be
explained through accompanying visual building blocks, such as XAI techniques.
The flow and APIs of the structural building blocks form an explicit overview
of the system. This serves as a communication basis for both humans and
automated agents like LLMs, aligning human and machine interpretability of AI
models. We discuss a selection of building blocks and concretize our flow-based
approach in an architecture and accompanying prototype interactive system.

Result: 实验表明，FlexPainter在灵活性和生成质量上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FlexPainter解决了现有纹理生成方法的局限性，提供了更灵活和高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Texture map production is an important part of 3D modeling and determines the
rendering quality. Recently, diffusion-based methods have opened a new way for
texture generation. However, restricted control flexibility and limited prompt
modalities may prevent creators from producing desired results. Furthermore,
inconsistencies between generated multi-view images often lead to poor texture
generation quality. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{FlexPainter},
a novel texture generation pipeline that enables flexible multi-modal
conditional guidance and achieves highly consistent texture generation. A
shared conditional embedding space is constructed to perform flexible
aggregation between different input modalities. Utilizing such embedding space,
we present an image-based CFG method to decompose structural and style
information, achieving reference image-based stylization. Leveraging the 3D
knowledge within the image diffusion prior, we first generate multi-view images
simultaneously using a grid representation to enhance global understanding.
Meanwhile, we propose a view synchronization and adaptive weighting module
during diffusion sampling to further ensure local consistency. Finally, a
3D-aware texture completion model combined with a texture enhancement model is
used to generate seamless, high-resolution texture maps. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both flexibility and generation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集主要关注逼真重建，缺乏对物理交互的支持。PhysGaia填补了这一空白，提供复杂动态场景和多样物理材料。

Method: 数据集通过物理求解器生成严格遵循物理定律的场景，并提供3D粒子轨迹和物理参数作为真实数据。

Result: PhysGaia支持定量评估物理建模，并为DyNVS模型提供集成管道和结果报告。

Conclusion: PhysGaia将推动动态视角合成、物理场景理解和深度学习与物理模拟的结合，实现更真实的复杂动态场景重建。

Abstract: We introduce PhysGaia, a novel physics-aware dataset specifically designed
for Dynamic Novel View Synthesis (DyNVS), encompassing both structured objects
and unstructured physical phenomena. Unlike existing datasets that primarily
focus on photorealistic reconstruction, PhysGaia is created to actively support
physics-aware dynamic scene modeling. Our dataset provides complex dynamic
scenarios with rich interactions among multiple objects, where they
realistically collide with each other and exchange forces. Furthermore, it
contains a diverse range of physical materials, such as liquid, gas,
viscoelastic substance, and textile, which moves beyond the rigid bodies
prevalent in existing datasets. All scenes in PhysGaia are faithfully generated
to strictly adhere to physical laws, leveraging carefully selected
material-specific physics solvers. To enable quantitative evaluation of
physical modeling, our dataset provides essential ground-truth information,
including 3D particle trajectories and physics parameters, e.g., viscosity. To
facilitate research adoption, we also provide essential integration pipelines
for using state-of-the-art DyNVS models with our dataset and report their
results. By addressing the critical lack of datasets for physics-aware
modeling, PhysGaia will significantly advance research in dynamic view
synthesis, physics-based scene understanding, and deep learning models
integrated with physical simulation -- ultimately enabling more faithful
reconstruction and interpretation of complex dynamic scenes. Our datasets and
codes are available in the project website,

estimation methods accurately compute the food volume but lack for food
portions selection. We present VolTex, a framework that improves \change{the
food object selection} in food volume estimation. Allowing users to specify a
target food item via text input to be segmented, our method enables the precise
selection of specific food objects in real-world scenes. The segmented object
is then reconstructed using the Neural Surface Reconstruction method to
generate high-fidelity 3D meshes for volume computation. Extensive evaluations
on the MetaFood3D dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
isolating and reconstructing food items for accurate volume estimation. The

Method: 结合显式姿态条件和SMPL-X神经纹理，使用基于transformer的大规模重建模型和DPT解码器。

Result: 在重建精度、动画保真度和泛化性能上显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: HumanRAM为单目或稀疏图像下的人体重建和动画提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D human reconstruction and animation are long-standing topics in computer
graphics and vision. However, existing methods typically rely on sophisticated
dense-view capture and/or time-consuming per-subject optimization procedures.
To address these limitations, we propose HumanRAM, a novel feed-forward
approach for generalizable human reconstruction and animation from monocular or
sparse human images. Our approach integrates human reconstruction and animation
into a unified framework by introducing explicit pose conditions, parameterized
by a shared SMPL-X neural texture, into transformer-based large reconstruction
models (LRM). Given monocular or sparse input images with associated camera
parameters and SMPL-X poses, our model employs scalable transformers and a
DPT-based decoder to synthesize realistic human renderings under novel
viewpoints and novel poses. By leveraging the explicit pose conditions, our
model simultaneously enables high-quality human reconstruction and
high-fidelity pose-controlled animation. Experiments show that HumanRAM
significantly surpasses previous methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy,
animation fidelity, and generalization performance on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly applied to the condition
monitoring of vehicular equipment, aiming to enhance maintenance strategies,

across edge nodes is dynamically triggered by network-related metrics. Our
approach has been implemented and tested in a real-world race circuit

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于支持样本的深度学习方法SSIPNet，利用少量支持样本预测个性化语音清晰度，优于传统听力图方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统听力图方法仅基于纯音阈值，准确性有限，需更精准的个性化预测方法。

Method: 利用支持样本（音频、评分）对，结合深度学习模型SSIPNet，构建高维表征预测新音频表现。

Result: 在Clarity Prediction Challenge数据集上，即使少量支持样本，SSIPNet仍优于听力图方法。

Conclusion: SSIPNet为个性化语音清晰度预测提供了新范式。

Abstract: Personalized speech intelligibility prediction is challenging. Previous
approaches have mainly relied on audiograms, which are inherently limited in
accuracy as they only capture a listener's hearing threshold for pure tones.
Rather than incorporating additional listener features, we propose a novel
approach that leverages an individual's existing intelligibility data to
predict their performance on new audio. We introduce the Support Sample-Based
Intelligibility Prediction Network (SSIPNet), a deep learning model that
leverages speech foundation models to build a high-dimensional representation
of a listener's speech recognition ability from multiple support (audio, score)
pairs, enabling accurate predictions for unseen audio. Results on the Clarity
Prediction Challenge dataset show that, even with a small number of support
(audio, score) pairs, our method outperforms audiogram-based predictions. Our
work presents a new paradigm for personalized speech intelligibility
prediction.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了三种预训练音频嵌入（OpenL3、VGGish和Wav2Vec2.0）在帕金森病（PD）分类中的效果，发现OpenL3在特定任务中表现最佳，而Wav2Vec2.0存在性别偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音障碍是帕金森病的生物标志物，但现有研究未充分探讨个体差异对深度声学特征分类效果的影响。

Method: 使用NeuroVoz数据集，比较三种预训练音频嵌入在DDK和LR任务中的表现。

Result: OpenL3在DDK和LR任务中表现最优，Wav2Vec2.0在DDK任务中显示出性别偏差。误分类案例揭示了非典型语音模式的挑战。

Conclusion: 研究强调了改进特征提取和模型鲁棒性在PD检测中的重要性。

Abstract: Speech impairments are prevalent biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease (PD),
motivating the development of diagnostic techniques using speech data for
clinical applications. Although deep acoustic features have shown promise for
PD classification, their effectiveness often varies due to individual speaker
differences, a factor that has not been thoroughly explored in the existing
literature. This study investigates the effectiveness of three pre-trained
audio embeddings (OpenL3, VGGish and Wav2Vec2.0 models) for PD classification.
Using the NeuroVoz dataset, OpenL3 outperforms others in diadochokinesis (DDK)
and listen and repeat (LR) tasks, capturing critical acoustic features for PD
detection. Only Wav2Vec2.0 shows significant gender bias, achieving more
favorable results for male speakers, in DDK tasks. The misclassified cases
reveal challenges with atypical speech patterns, highlighting the need for
improved feature extraction and model robustness in PD detection.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于音素簇和常见学习者错误的替代感知对齐无关GOP方法，以提升发音质量评估的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GOP依赖强制对齐，易受声学变异导致的标注和分割错误影响，而对齐无关方法虽解决这些问题但计算成本高。

Method: 引入替代感知对齐无关GOP，限制音素替代基于音素簇和常见学习者错误。

Result: 在My Pronunciation Coach和SpeechOcean762数据集上，限制音素替代（RPS）优于无限制（UPS）和基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了效率，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) systems employ automatic
measures of pronunciation quality, such as the goodness of pronunciation (GOP)
metric. GOP relies on forced alignments, which are prone to labeling and
segmentation errors due to acoustic variability. While alignment-free methods
address these challenges, they are computationally expensive and scale poorly
with phoneme sequence length and inventory size. To enhance efficiency, we
introduce a substitution-aware alignment-free GOP that restricts phoneme
substitutions based on phoneme clusters and common learner errors. We evaluated
our GOP on two L2 English speech datasets, one with child speech, My
Pronunciation Coach (MPC), and SpeechOcean762, which includes child and adult
speech. We compared RPS (restricted phoneme substitutions) and UPS
(unrestricted phoneme substitutions) setups within alignment-free methods,
which outperformed the baseline. We discuss our results and outline avenues for
future research.

Result: Dhvani系统能够有效识别和分析印地语发音错误，并提供针对性反馈。

Conclusion: 该研究为印地语发音训练提供了创新工具，并展示了其在语言学习中的潜力。

Abstract: Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) has been extensively studied
for English. However, there remains a critical gap in its application to Indian
languages with a base of 1.5 billion speakers. Pronunciation tools tailored to
Indian languages are strikingly lacking despite the fact that millions learn
them every year. With over 600 million speakers and being the fourth
most-spoken language worldwide, improving Hindi pronunciation is a vital first
step toward addressing this gap. This paper proposes 1) Dhvani -- a novel CAPT
system for Hindi, 2) synthetic speech generation for Hindi mispronunciations,
and 3) a novel methodology for providing personalized feedback to learners.
While the system often interacts with learners using Devanagari graphemes, its
core analysis targets phonemic distinctions, leveraging Hindi's highly phonetic
orthography to analyze mispronounced speech and provide targeted feedback.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTS系统仅能处理有限的情感类别，而人类对话情感更为多样，需探索更自然的情感语音生成。

Method: 采用LLM-TTS架构，通过情感相关提示学习定量捕捉情感权重，灵活调整情感比例生成混合情感语音。

Result: PUE在零样本设置下成功生成了未见情感的语音。

Conclusion: PUE方法为多样化情感语音合成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing expressive text-to-speech (TTS) systems primarily model a limited
set of categorical emotions, whereas human conversations extend far beyond
these predefined emotions, making it essential to explore more diverse
emotional speech generation for more natural interactions. To bridge this gap,
this paper proposes a novel prompt-unseen-emotion (PUE) approach to generate
unseen emotional speech via emotion-guided prompt learning. PUE is trained
utilizing an LLM-TTS architecture to ensure emotional consistency between
categorical emotion-relevant prompts and emotional speech, allowing the model
to quantitatively capture different emotion weightings per utterance. During
inference, mixed emotional speech can be generated by flexibly adjusting
emotion proportions and leveraging LLM contextual knowledge, enabling the model
to quantify different emotional styles. Our proposed PUE successfully
facilitates expressive speech synthesis of unseen emotions in a zero-shot
setting.

Result: 实验结果表明，CapSpeech支持高保真和高度可理解的语音合成，覆盖多种说话风格。

Conclusion: CapSpeech是目前最大的CapTTS相关任务数据集，为开发CapTTS系统提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence have significantly
transformed the field of style-captioned text-to-speech synthesis (CapTTS).
However, adapting CapTTS to real-world applications remains challenging due to
the lack of standardized, comprehensive datasets and limited research on
downstream tasks built upon CapTTS. To address these gaps, we introduce
CapSpeech, a new benchmark designed for a series of CapTTS-related tasks,
including style-captioned text-to-speech synthesis with sound events
(CapTTS-SE), accent-captioned TTS (AccCapTTS), emotion-captioned TTS
(EmoCapTTS), and text-to-speech synthesis for chat agent (AgentTTS). CapSpeech
comprises over 10 million machine-annotated audio-caption pairs and nearly 0.36
million human-annotated audio-caption pairs. In addition, we introduce two new
datasets collected and recorded by a professional voice actor and experienced
audio engineers, specifically for the AgentTTS and CapTTS-SE tasks. Alongside
the datasets, we conduct comprehensive experiments using both autoregressive
and non-autoregressive models on CapSpeech. Our results demonstrate
high-fidelity and highly intelligible speech synthesis across a diverse range
of speaking styles. To the best of our knowledge, CapSpeech is the largest
available dataset offering comprehensive annotations for CapTTS-related tasks.
The experiments and findings further provide valuable insights into the
challenges of developing CapTTS systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种滑动窗口扩散框架用于语音增强，解决了传统扩散模型计算成本高的问题，实现了性能与延迟的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型在语音增强中表现优异但计算成本高，无法实时处理流数据。

Method: 采用滑动窗口扩散框架，随时间逐步污染语音信号，对当前帧分配更多噪声，通过缓冲区大小平衡性能与延迟。

Result: 实验表明该方法优于标准扩散模型，GPU上运行高效，输入输出延迟为0.3至1秒。

Conclusion: 这是首个实用的基于扩散的在线语音增强解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models are a class of generative models that have been recently
used for speech enhancement with remarkable success but are computationally
expensive at inference time. Therefore, these models are impractical for
processing streaming data in real-time. In this work, we adapt a sliding window
diffusion framework to the speech enhancement task. Our approach progressively
corrupts speech signals through time, assigning more noise to frames close to
the present in a buffer. This approach outputs denoised frames with a delay
proportional to the chosen buffer size, enabling a trade-off between
performance and latency. Empirical results demonstrate that our method
outperforms standard diffusion models and runs efficiently on a GPU, achieving
an input-output latency in the order of 0.3 to 1 seconds. This marks the first
practical diffusion-based solution for online speech enhancement.

Method: SmilesGEN结合预训练的药物VAE（SmilesNet）和表达谱VAE（ProfileNet），通过潜在空间消除药物扰动重建表达谱，并基于期望表达谱生成分子。

Result: 实验表明，SmilesGEN在分子有效性、独特性、新颖性及与已知配体的相似性上优于现有模型，并在支架优化和药物生成中表现优异。

Conclusion: SmilesGEN为利用基因特征生成具有潜在治疗效果的分子提供了稳健框架。

Abstract: The de novo generation of drug-like molecules capable of inducing desirable
phenotypic changes is receiving increasing attention. However, previous methods
predominantly rely on expression profiles to guide molecule generation, but
overlook the perturbative effect of the molecules on cellular contexts. To
overcome this limitation, we propose SmilesGEN, a novel generative model based
on variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture to generate molecules with
potential therapeutic effects. SmilesGEN integrates a pre-trained drug VAE
(SmilesNet) with an expression profile VAE (ProfileNet), jointly modeling the
interplay between drug perturbations and transcriptional responses in a common
latent space. Specifically, ProfileNet is imposed to reconstruct pre-treatment
expression profiles when eliminating drug-induced perturbations in the latent
space, while SmilesNet is informed by desired expression profiles to generate
drug-like molecules. Our empirical experiments demonstrate that SmilesGEN
outperforms current state-of-the-art models in generating molecules with higher
degree of validity, uniqueness, novelty, as well as higher Tanimoto similarity
to known ligands targeting the relevant proteins. Moreover, we evaluate
SmilesGEN for scaffold-based molecule optimization and generation of
therapeutic agents, and confirmed its superior performance in generating
molecules with higher similarity to approved drugs. SmilesGEN establishes a
robust framework that leverages gene signatures to generate drug-like molecules
that hold promising potential to induce desirable cellular phenotypic changes.

Abstract: Recently, extensive deep learning architectures and pretraining strategies
have been explored to support downstream protein applications. Additionally,
domain-specific models incorporating biological knowledge have been developed
to enhance performance in specialized tasks. In this work, we introduce
$\textbf{Protap}$, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically compares
backbone architectures, pretraining strategies, and domain-specific models
across diverse and realistic downstream protein applications. Specifically,
Protap covers five applications: three general tasks and two novel specialized
tasks, i.e., enzyme-catalyzed protein cleavage site prediction and targeted
protein degradation, which are industrially relevant yet missing from existing
benchmarks. For each application, Protap compares various domain-specific
models and general architectures under multiple pretraining settings. Our
empirical studies imply that: (i) Though large-scale pretraining encoders
achieve great results, they often underperform supervised encoders trained on
small downstream training sets. (ii) Incorporating structural information
during downstream fine-tuning can match or even outperform protein language
models pretrained on large-scale sequence corpora. (iii) Domain-specific
biological priors can enhance performance on specialized downstream tasks. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率监测AGB和AGBD对于碳核算和生态系统管理至关重要，但现有商业遥感产品缺乏独立验证。

Method: 使用FIA数据对terraPulse的AGBD数据集进行独立验证，通过空间和统计分析评估一致性。

Result: 在六边形和县级尺度上，terraPulse与FIA数据表现出强相关性（R2=0.88-0.90），但在非森林和高生物量森林区域存在偏差。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一个可扩展的AGBD验证框架，并为全球生物量监测的商业数据集提供了基准验证。

Abstract: Monitoring aboveground biomass (AGB) and its density (AGBD) at high
resolution is essential for carbon accounting and ecosystem management. While
NASA's spaceborne Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) LiDAR mission
provides globally distributed reference measurements for AGBD estimation, the
majority of commercial remote sensing products based on GEDI remain without
rigorous or independent validation. Here, we present an independent regional
validation of an AGBD dataset offered by terraPulse, Inc., based on independent
reference data from the US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA)
program. Aggregated to 64,000-hectare hexagons and US counties across the US
states of Utah, Nevada, and Washington, we found very strong agreement between
terraPulse and FIA estimates. At the hexagon scale, we report R2 = 0.88, RMSE =
26.68 Mg/ha, and a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.94. At the county scale,
agreement improves to R2 = 0.90, RMSE =32.62 Mg/ha, slope = 1.07, and r = 0.95.
Spatial and statistical analyses indicated that terraPulse AGBD values tended
to exceed FIA estimates in non-forest areas, likely due to FIA's limited
sampling of non-forest vegetation. The terraPulse AGBD estimates also exhibited
lower values in high-biomass forests, likely due to saturation effects in its
optical remote-sensing covariates. This study advances operational carbon
monitoring by delivering a scalable framework for comprehensive AGBD validation
using independent FIA data, as well as a benchmark validation of a new
commercial dataset for global biomass monitoring.

### [500] [Enhancing Interpretability of Quantum-Assisted Blockchain Clustering via AI Agent-Based Qualitative Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02068)
*Yun-Cheng Tsai,Yen-Ku Liu,Samuel Yen-Chi Chen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合定量聚类评估与AI代理辅助定性解释的两阶段分析框架，以解决区块链交易数据聚类中的高维、噪声和纠缠问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区块链交易数据的高维、噪声和纠缠特性使传统聚类算法难以应对，且量子增强聚类模型的解释性有限，限制了其在敏感领域的应用。

Method: 第一阶段使用经典聚类方法和评估指标（如轮廓系数、Davies Bouldin指数等）确定最佳聚类数量；第二阶段引入AI代理生成聚类结果的语义解释。

Result: 实验表明，量子神经网络（QNN）在定量指标上优于随机量子特征（QF），而AI代理揭示了QNN模型的单例聚类现象。两阶段分析支持三聚类配置。

Conclusion: 该研究提升了量子辅助区块链分析的解释性，为未来自主AI驱动的聚类框架奠定了基础。

Abstract: Blockchain transaction data is inherently high dimensional, noisy, and
entangled, posing substantial challenges for traditional clustering algorithms.
While quantum enhanced clustering models have demonstrated promising
performance gains, their interpretability remains limited, restricting their
application in sensitive domains such as financial fraud detection and
blockchain governance. To address this gap, we propose a two stage analysis
framework that synergistically combines quantitative clustering evaluation with
AI Agent assisted qualitative interpretation. In the first stage, we employ
classical clustering methods and evaluation metrics including the Silhouette
Score, Davies Bouldin Index, and Calinski Harabasz Index to determine the
optimal cluster count and baseline partition quality. In the second stage, we
integrate an AI Agent to generate human readable, semantic explanations of
clustering results, identifying intra cluster characteristics and inter cluster
relationships. Our experiments reveal that while fully trained Quantum Neural
Networks (QNN) outperform random Quantum Features (QF) in quantitative metrics,
the AI Agent further uncovers nuanced differences between these methods,
notably exposing the singleton cluster phenomenon in QNN driven models. The
consolidated insights from both stages consistently endorse the three cluster
configuration, demonstrating the practical value of our hybrid approach. This
work advances the interpretability frontier in quantum assisted blockchain
analytics and lays the groundwork for future autonomous AI orchestrated
clustering frameworks.

*András Strausz,Niels Pardon,Ioana Giurgiu*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种跨引擎优化器，通过学习的成本模型自动选择最适合执行SQL查询的引擎，显著提高了查询效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lakehouse系统中，手动选择适合SQL查询的执行引擎复杂且低效，尤其是随着新引擎和工作负载的出现。

Method: 提出基于多任务学习的成本模型，利用查询计划和提示进行成本预测和路由选择，支持灵活添加新引擎。

Result: 实验表明，优化后的查询计划使平均Q-error降低12.6%，跨引擎优化器在零样本和少样本设置下分别减少总运行时25.2%和30.4%。

Conclusion: 跨引擎优化器有效解决了引擎选择问题，显著提升了查询性能，且易于扩展新引擎。

Abstract: Lakehouse systems enable the same data to be queried with multiple execution
engines. However, selecting the engine best suited to run a SQL query still
requires a priori knowledge of the query computational requirements and an
engine capability, a complex and manual task that only becomes more difficult
with the emergence of new engines and workloads. In this paper, we address this
limitation by proposing a cross-engine optimizer that can automate engine
selection for diverse SQL queries through a learned cost model. Optimized with
hints, a query plan is used for query cost prediction and routing. Cost
prediction is formulated as a multi-task learning problem, and multiple
predictor heads, corresponding to different engines and provisionings, are used
in the model architecture. This eliminates the need to train engine-specific
models and allows the flexible addition of new engines at a minimal fine-tuning
cost. Results on various databases and engines show that using a query
optimized logical plan for cost estimation decreases the average Q-error by
even 12.6% over using unoptimized plans as input. Moreover, the proposed
cross-engine optimizer reduces the total workload runtime by up to 25.2% in a
zero-shot setting and 30.4% in a few-shot setting when compared to random
routing.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩展PLoM的生成学习框架，结合Double Diffusion Maps和Geometric Harmonics，解决小样本高维数据过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始PLoM方法在小样本高维数据下易过拟合，需改进以保持统计一致性和泛化能力。

Method: 结合Double Diffusion Maps（捕捉多尺度几何特征）和Geometric Harmonics（高维非线性插值），直接在隐空间求解完整ISDE。

Result: 通过二维Hermite多项式和高保真爆轰波模拟验证了方法的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 新方法克服了小样本高维数据的局限性，保留了系统动态复杂性，提升了生成质量。

Abstract: We present a generative learning framework for probabilistic sampling based
on an extension of the Probabilistic Learning on Manifolds (PLoM) approach,
which is designed to generate statistically consistent realizations of a random
vector in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space, informed by a limited (yet
representative) set of observations. In its original form, PLoM constructs a
reduced-order probabilistic model by combining three main components: (a)
kernel density estimation to approximate the underlying probability measure,
(b) Diffusion Maps to uncover the intrinsic low-dimensional manifold structure,
and (c) a reduced-order Ito Stochastic Differential Equation (ISDE) to sample
from the learned distribution. A key challenge arises, however, when the number
of available data points N is small and the dimensionality of the diffusion-map
basis approaches N, resulting in overfitting and loss of generalization. To
overcome this limitation, we propose an enabling extension that implements a
synthesis of Double Diffusion Maps -- a technique capable of capturing
multiscale geometric features of the data -- with Geometric Harmonics (GH), a
nonparametric reconstruction method that allows smooth nonlinear interpolation
in high-dimensional ambient spaces. This approach enables us to solve a
full-order ISDE directly in the latent space, preserving the full dynamical
complexity of the system, while leveraging its reduced geometric
representation. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method are
illustrated through two numerical studies: one based on data generated from
two-dimensional Hermite polynomial functions and another based on high-fidelity
simulations of a detonation wave in a reactive flow.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的算法稳定性框架，用于解决排名问题中的不稳定性，并提出了两种新的排名操作符：膨胀top-k和膨胀全排名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实数据中常存在分数相近的候选项，导致排名对数据扰动敏感，现有理论假设分离条件，限制了其适用性。

Method: 开发了新的算法稳定性框架，提出了膨胀top-k和膨胀全排名两种方法，允许输出中存在不确定性。

Result: 实验证明，所提方法在不牺牲信息量的前提下实现了稳定性。

Conclusion: 新方法无需数据分布假设或候选数量依赖，为排名问题提供了稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we consider ranking problems among a finite set of candidates:
for instance, selecting the top-$k$ items among a larger list of candidates or
obtaining the full ranking of all items in the set. These problems are often
unstable, in the sense that estimating a ranking from noisy data can exhibit
high sensitivity to small perturbations. Concretely, if we use data to provide
a score for each item (say, by aggregating preference data over a sample of
users), then for two items with similar scores, small fluctuations in the data
can alter the relative ranking of those items. Many existing theoretical
results for ranking problems assume a separation condition to avoid this
challenge, but real-world data often contains items whose scores are
approximately tied, limiting the applicability of existing theory. To address
this gap, we develop a new algorithmic stability framework for ranking
problems, and propose two novel ranking operators for achieving stable ranking:
the \emph{inflated top-$k$} for the top-$k$ selection problem and the
\emph{inflated full ranking} for ranking the full list. To enable stability,
each method allows for expressing some uncertainty in the output. For both of
these two problems, our proposed methods provide guaranteed stability, with no
assumptions on data distributions and no dependence on the total number of
candidates to be ranked. Experiments on real-world data confirm that the
proposed methods offer stability without compromising the informativeness of
the output.

Motivation: 数字健康技术生成的多模态数据潜力巨大，但现有方法依赖监督学习，标注成本高且不切实际。

Method: 提出MoCA框架，结合跨模态掩码和Transformer自编码器，利用模态内和跨模态相关性。

Result: 实验表明，MoCA在重建和下游任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MoCA展示了自监督学习在数字健康和多模态数据中的变革潜力。

Abstract: The growing prevalence of digital health technologies has led to the
generation of complex multi-modal data, such as physical activity measurements
simultaneously collected from various sensors of mobile and wearable devices.
These data hold immense potential for advancing health studies, but current
methods predominantly rely on supervised learning, requiring extensive labeled
datasets that are often expensive or impractical to obtain, especially in
clinical studies. To address this limitation, we propose a self-supervised
learning framework called Multi-modal Cross-masked Autoencoder (MoCA) that
leverages cross-modality masking and the Transformer autoencoder architecture
to utilize both temporal correlations within modalities and cross-modal
correlations between data streams. We also provide theoretical guarantees to
support the effectiveness of the cross-modality masking scheme in MoCA.
Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing approaches in both reconstruction and downstream tasks. We
release open-source code for data processing, pre-training, and downstream
tasks in the supplementary materials. This work highlights the transformative
potential of self-supervised learning in digital health and multi-modal data.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study gradient descent (GD) with a constant stepsize for
$\ell_2$-regularized logistic regression with linearly separable data.
Classical theory suggests small stepsizes to ensure monotonic reduction of the
optimization objective, achieving exponential convergence in
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\kappa)$ steps with $\kappa$ being the condition
number. Surprisingly, we show that this can be accelerated to
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\kappa})$ by simply using a large stepsize --
for which the objective evolves nonmonotonically. The acceleration brought by
large stepsizes extends to minimizing the population risk for separable
distributions, improving on the best-known upper bounds on the number of steps
to reach a near-optimum. Finally, we characterize the largest stepsize for the
local convergence of GD, which also determines the global convergence in
special scenarios. Our results extend the analysis of Wu et al. (2024) from
convex settings with minimizers at infinity to strongly convex cases with
finite minimizers.

Result: 数值模拟和案例研究表明TSSDMN能有效理解动态多层网络。

Conclusion: TSSDMN为动态多层网络的建模提供了新思路，具有理论和实践意义。

Abstract: Understanding the complex interactions within dynamic multilayer networks is
critical for advancements in various scientific domains. Existing models often
fail to capture such networks' temporal and cross-layer dynamics. This paper
introduces a novel Tensor State Space Model for Dynamic Multilayer Networks
(TSSDMN), utilizing a latent space model framework. TSSDMN employs a symmetric
Tucker decomposition to represent latent node features, their interaction
patterns, and layer transitions. Then by fixing the latent features and
allowing the interaction patterns to evolve over time, TSSDMN uniquely captures
both the temporal dynamics within layers and across different layers. The model
identifiability conditions are discussed. By treating latent features as
variables whose posterior distributions are approximated using a mean-field
variational inference approach, a variational Expectation Maximization
algorithm is developed for efficient model inference. Numerical simulations and
case studies demonstrate the efficacy of TSSDMN for understanding dynamic
multilayer networks.

Conclusion: 研究为理解序列数据对注意力模型学习的益处提供了严谨且可解释的基础。

Abstract: We study the dynamics of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for a class of
sequence models termed Sequence Single-Index (SSI) models, where the target
depends on a single direction in input space applied to a sequence of tokens.
This setting generalizes classical single-index models to the sequential
domain, encompassing simplified one-layer attention architectures. We derive a
closed-form expression for the population loss in terms of a pair of sufficient
statistics capturing semantic and positional alignment, and characterize the
induced high-dimensional SGD dynamics for these coordinates. Our analysis
reveals two distinct training phases: escape from uninformative initialization
and alignment with the target subspace, and demonstrates how the sequence
length and positional encoding influence convergence speed and learning
trajectories. These results provide a rigorous and interpretable foundation for
understanding how sequential structure in data can be beneficial for learning
with attention-based models.

Conclusion: 结构相关性和学习顺序在多模态高维推理中至关重要，顺序课程学习策略解决了联合学习的瓶颈。

Abstract: We study the recovery of multiple high-dimensional signals from two noisy,
correlated modalities: a spiked matrix and a spiked tensor sharing a common
low-rank structure. This setting generalizes classical spiked matrix and tensor
models, unveiling intricate interactions between inference channels and
surprising algorithmic behaviors. Notably, while the spiked tensor model is
typically intractable at low signal-to-noise ratios, its correlation with the
matrix enables efficient recovery via Bayesian Approximate Message Passing,
inducing staircase-like phase transitions reminiscent of neural network
phenomena. In contrast, empirical risk minimization for joint learning fails:
the tensor component obstructs effective matrix recovery, and joint
optimization significantly degrades performance, highlighting the limitations
of naive multi-modal learning. We show that a simple Sequential Curriculum
Learning strategy-first recovering the matrix, then leveraging it to guide
tensor recovery-resolves this bottleneck and achieves optimal weak recovery
thresholds. This strategy, implementable with spectral methods, emphasizes the
critical role of structural correlation and learning order in multi-modal
high-dimensional inference.

Result: SA-GFN实现无偏采样，增强多样性，生成高奖励图且匹配目标分布。

Conclusion: SA-GFN有效解决了GFlowNets的偏差问题，提升了图生成性能。

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) offer a powerful framework for sampling
graphs in proportion to their rewards. However, existing approaches suffer from
systematic biases due to inaccuracies in state transition probability
computations. These biases, rooted in the inherent symmetries of graphs, impact
both atom-based and fragment-based generation schemes. To address this
challenge, we introduce Symmetry-Aware GFlowNets (SA-GFN), a method that
incorporates symmetry corrections into the learning process through reward
scaling. By integrating bias correction directly into the reward structure,
SA-GFN eliminates the need for explicit state transition computations.
Empirical results show that SA-GFN enables unbiased sampling while enhancing
diversity and consistently generating high-reward graphs that closely match the
target distribution.

Abstract: We address the problem of safely learning controlled stochastic dynamics from
discrete-time trajectory observations, ensuring system trajectories remain
within predefined safe regions during both training and deployment.
Safety-critical constraints of this kind are crucial in applications such as
autonomous robotics, finance, and biomedicine. We introduce a method that
ensures safe exploration and efficient estimation of system dynamics by
iteratively expanding an initial known safe control set using kernel-based
confidence bounds. After training, the learned model enables predictions of the
system's dynamics and permits safety verification of any given control. Our
approach requires only mild smoothness assumptions and access to an initial
safe control set, enabling broad applicability to complex real-world systems.
We provide theoretical guarantees for safety and derive adaptive learning rates
that improve with increasing Sobolev regularity of the true dynamics.
Experimental evaluations demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our method
in terms of safety, estimation accuracy, and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: CPME框架为反事实分布评估和采样提供了灵活且高效的工具。

Abstract: Estimating the distribution of outcomes under counterfactual policies is
critical for decision-making in domains such as recommendation, advertising,
and healthcare. We analyze a novel framework-Counterfactual Policy Mean
Embedding (CPME)-that represents the entire counterfactual outcome distribution
in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), enabling flexible and
nonparametric distributional off-policy evaluation. We introduce both a plug-in
estimator and a doubly robust estimator; the latter enjoys improved uniform
convergence rates by correcting for bias in both the outcome embedding and
propensity models. Building on this, we develop a doubly robust kernel test
statistic for hypothesis testing, which achieves asymptotic normality and thus
enables computationally efficient testing and straightforward construction of
confidence intervals. Our framework also supports sampling from the
counterfactual distribution. Numerical simulations illustrate the practical
benefits of CPME over existing methods.

Abstract: We present the OmniMatch algorithm for seeded multiple graph matching. In the
setting of $d$-dimensional Random Dot Product Graphs (RDPG), we prove that
under mild assumptions, OmniMatch with $s$ seeds asymptotically and efficiently
perfectly aligns $O(s^{\alpha})$ unseeded vertices -- for $\alpha<2\wedge d/4$
-- across multiple networks even in the presence of no edge correlation. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm across numerous simulations and
in the context of shuffled graph hypothesis testing. In the shuffled testing
setting, testing power is lost due to the misalignment/shuffling of vertices
across graphs, and we demonstrate the capacity of OmniMatch to correct for
misaligned vertices prior to testing and hence recover the lost testing power.
We further demonstrate the algorithm on a pair of data examples from
connectomics and machine translation.

Abstract: Bandit Convex Optimization is a fundamental class of sequential
decision-making problems, where the learner selects actions from a continuous
domain and observes a loss (but not its gradient) at only one point per round.
We study this problem in non-stationary environments, and aim to minimize the
regret under three standard measures of non-stationarity: the number of
switches $S$ in the comparator sequence, the total variation $\Delta$ of the
loss functions, and the path-length $P$ of the comparator sequence. We propose
a polynomial-time algorithm, Tilted Exponentially Weighted Average with
Sleeping Experts (TEWA-SE), which adapts the sleeping experts framework from
online convex optimization to the bandit setting. For strongly convex losses,
we prove that TEWA-SE is minimax-optimal with respect to known $S$ and $\Delta$
by establishing matching upper and lower bounds. By equipping TEWA-SE with the
Bandit-over-Bandit framework, we extend our analysis to environments with
unknown non-stationarity measures. For general convex losses, we introduce a
second algorithm, clipped Exploration by Optimization (cExO), based on
exponential weights over a discretized action space. While not polynomial-time
computable, this method achieves minimax-optimal regret with respect to known
$S$ and $\Delta$, and improves on the best existing bounds with respect to $P$.

Abstract: The importance of clinical variables in the prognosis of the disease is
explained using statistical correlation or machine learning (ML). However, the
predictive importance of these variables may not represent their causal
relationships with diseases. This paper uses clinical variables from a heart
failure (HF) patient cohort to investigate the causal explainability of
important variables obtained in statistical and ML contexts. Due to inherent
regression modeling, popular causal discovery methods strictly assume that the
cause and effect variables are numerical and continuous. This paper proposes a
new computational framework to enable causal structure discovery (CSD) and
score the causal strength of mixed-type (categorical, numerical, binary)
clinical variables for binary disease outcomes. In HF classification, we
investigate the association between the importance rank order of three feature
types: correlated features, features important for ML predictions, and causal
features. Our results demonstrate that CSD modeling for nonlinear causal
relationships is more meaningful than its linear counterparts. Feature
importance obtained from nonlinear classifiers (e.g., gradient-boosting trees)
strongly correlates with the causal strength of variables without
differentiating cause and effect variables. Correlated variables can be causal
for HF, but they are rarely identified as effect variables. These results can
be used to add the causal explanation of variables important for ML-based
prediction modeling.

Abstract: We present `GL-LowPopArt`, a novel Catoni-style estimator for generalized
low-rank trace regression. Building on `LowPopArt` (Jang et al., 2024), it
employs a two-stage approach: nuclear norm regularization followed by matrix
Catoni estimation. We establish state-of-the-art estimation error bounds,
surpassing existing guarantees (Fan et al., 2019; Kang et al., 2022), and
reveal a novel experimental design objective, $\mathrm{GL}(\pi)$. The key
technical challenge is controlling bias from the nonlinear inverse link
function, which we address by our two-stage approach. We prove a *local*
minimax lower bound, showing that our `GL-LowPopArt` enjoys instance-wise
optimality up to the condition number of the ground-truth Hessian. Applications

### [516] [Deep Learning Enhanced Multivariate GARCH](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02796)
*Haoyuan Wang,Chen Liu,Minh-Ngoc Tran,Chao Wang*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LSTM和BEKK模型的新框架LSTM-BEKK，用于改进多变量金融数据的波动性建模和预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多变量GARCH方法在捕捉非线性、动态和高维依赖结构方面存在局限性，尤其是在波动聚集和资产间不对称联动方面。

Method: 通过将LSTM的灵活性与BEKK模型的计量结构结合，设计出LSTM-BEKK模型，以更好地适应时变市场条件。

Result: 实证结果表明，LSTM-BEKK在样本外投资组合风险预测中表现优越，同时保持了BEKK模型的可解释性。

Conclusion: 混合计量经济学与深度学习模型在金融风险管理和多变量波动预测中具有潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multivariate volatility modeling framework,
named Long Short-Term Memory enhanced BEKK (LSTM-BEKK), that integrates deep
learning into multivariate GARCH processes. By combining the flexibility of
recurrent neural networks with the econometric structure of BEKK models, our
approach is designed to better capture nonlinear, dynamic, and high-dimensional
dependence structures in financial return data. The proposed model addresses
key limitations of traditional multivariate GARCH-based methods, particularly
in capturing persistent volatility clustering and asymmetric co-movement across
assets. Leveraging the data-driven nature of LSTMs, the framework adapts
effectively to time-varying market conditions, offering improved robustness and
forecasting performance. Empirical results across multiple equity markets
confirm that the LSTM-BEKK model achieves superior performance in terms of
out-of-sample portfolio risk forecast, while maintaining the interpretability
from the BEKK models. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid
econometric-deep learning models in advancing financial risk management and
multivariate volatility forecasting.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何利用深度强化学习（DRL）在移动边缘计算（MEC）系统中实现分散式动态计算卸载策略，提出了一种基于Twin Delayed DDPG算法的新方法，优于传统的DDPG策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MEC系统中计算卸载策略的分散化和动态化问题，克服传统DDPG算法的固有缺陷。

Method: 采用Twin Delayed DDPG算法，独立学习每个用户的计算卸载策略，适用于移动用户场景。

Result: 数值结果表明，用户能自主学习有效策略，新方法性能优于传统DDPG策略。

Conclusion: Twin Delayed DDPG算法为MEC系统提供了更优的动态计算卸载解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) allows appliances to offload workloads to
neighboring MEC servers that have the potential for computation-intensive tasks
with limited computational capabilities. This paper studied how deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms are used in an MEC system to find
feasible decentralized dynamic computation offloading strategies, which leads
to the construction of an extensible MEC system that operates effectively with
finite feedback. Even though the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
algorithm, subject to their knowledge of the MEC system, can be used to
allocate powers of both computation offloading and local execution, to learn a
computation offloading policy for each user independently, we realized that
this solution still has some inherent weaknesses. Hence, we introduced a new
approach for this problem based on the Twin Delayed DDPG algorithm, which
enables us to overcome this proneness and investigate cases where mobile users
are portable. Numerical results showed that individual users can autonomously
learn adequate policies through the proposed approach. Besides, the performance
of the suggested solution exceeded the conventional DDPG-based power control
strategy.

Motivation: 解决聚合物材料数据中异常值对机器学习预测模型的负面影响，加速新材料开发。

Method: 结合多算法异常检测与选择性重实验，构建包含701个测量值的数据集，验证方法在多种机器学习模型中的效果。

Result: 预测误差（RMSE）显著降低，准确性提高，仅需重测约5%的数据。

Conclusion: 数据质量提升对聚合物科学中机器学习应用至关重要，提供了一种可扩展的策略以提高预测可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of polymer material properties through data-driven
approaches greatly accelerates novel material development by reducing redundant
experiments and trial-and-error processes. However, inevitable outliers in
empirical measurements can severely skew machine learning results, leading to
erroneous prediction models and suboptimal material designs. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel approach to enhance dataset quality efficiently
by integrating multi-algorithm outlier detection with selective
re-experimentation of unreliable outlier cases. To validate the empirical
effectiveness of the approach, we systematically construct a new dataset
containing 701 measurements of three key mechanical properties: glass
transition temperature ($T_g$), tan $\delta$ peak, and crosslinking density
($v_{c}$). To demonstrate its general applicability, we report the performance
improvements across multiple machine learning models, including Elastic Net,
SVR, Random Forest, and TPOT, to predict the three key properties. Our method
reliably reduces prediction error (RMSE) and significantly improves accuracy
with minimal additional experimental work, requiring only about 5% of the
dataset to be re-measured.These findings highlight the importance of data
quality enhancement in achieving reliable machine learning applications in
polymer science and present a scalable strategy for improving predictive
reliability in materials science.

*Saurabh Agrawal,Raj Gohil,Gopal Kumar Agrawal,Vikram C M,Kushal Verma*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SALF-MOS的新模型，用于预测语音合成的MOS评分，解决了传统主观评分耗时和客观评分不可靠的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音质量评估中，客观指标不可靠，主观评分（如MOS）耗时且费力，需要一种高效且可靠的替代方法。

Method: 使用卷积序列堆叠提取音频样本的潜在特征，构建了一个小型、端到端、高度通用且可扩展的模型。

Result: 模型在MSE、LCC、SRCC和KTAU等指标上取得了最佳效果。

Conclusion: SALF-MOS模型为语音合成质量评估提供了一种高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Speech quality assessment is a critical process in selecting text-to-speech
synthesis (TTS) or voice conversion models. Evaluation of voice synthesis can
be done using objective metrics or subjective metrics. Although there are many
objective metrics like the Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ),
Perceptual Objective Listening Quality Assessment (POLQA) or Short-Time
Objective Intelligibility (STOI) but none of them is feasible in selecting the
best model. On the other hand subjective metric like Mean Opinion Score is
highly reliable but it requires a lot of manual efforts and are time-consuming.
To counter the issues in MOS Evaluation, we have developed a novel model,
Speaker Agnostic Latent Features (SALF)-Mean Opinion Score (MOS) which is a
small-sized, end-to-end, highly generalized and scalable model for predicting
MOS score on a scale of 5. We use the sequences of convolutions and stack them
to get the latent features of the audio samples to get the best
state-of-the-art results based on mean squared error (MSE), Linear Concordance
Correlation coefficient (LCC), Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient (SRCC) and
Kendall Rank Correlation Coefficient (KTAU).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多语言环境中，说话者识别模型因语音嵌入中语言信息的纠缠而面临挑战，需要分离语言和说话者信息以提高识别准确性。

Method: 采用基于前缀调优的交叉注意力的联合学习策略，特别适用于说话者在不同语言间切换的场景。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在单语言和多语言环境下均表现良好，包括未见过的语言，显著降低了等错误率。

Conclusion: 所提模型能有效分离语言信息与说话者嵌入，提升多样化语言条件下的识别性能。

Abstract: Speaker recognition models face challenges in multi-lingual settings due to
the entanglement of linguistic information within speaker embeddings. The
overlap between vocal traits such as accent, vocal anatomy, and a language's
phonetic structure complicates separating linguistic and speaker information.
Disentangling these components can significantly improve speaker recognition
accuracy. To this end, we propose a novel disentanglement learning strategy
that integrates joint learning through prefix-tuned cross-attention. This
approach is particularly effective when speakers switch between languages.
Experimental results show the model generalizes across monolingual and
multi-lingual settings, including unseen languages. Notably, the proposed model
improves the equal error rate across multiple datasets, highlighting its
ability to separate language information from speaker embeddings and enhance
recognition in diverse linguistic conditions.

Result: 通过Frechet距离和标准指标评估，系统在源追踪任务中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在音频源追踪中表现出色，尤其在区分真实与伪造语音及追踪伪造源方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Audio deepfakes are acquiring an unprecedented level of realism with advanced
AI. While current research focuses on discerning real speech from spoofed
speech, tracing the source system is equally crucial. This work proposes a
novel audio source tracing system combining deep metric multi-class N-pair loss
with Real Emphasis and Fake Dispersion framework, a Conformer classification
network, and ensemble score-embedding fusion. The N-pair loss improves
discriminative ability, while Real Emphasis and Fake Dispersion enhance
robustness by focusing on differentiating real and fake speech patterns. The
Conformer network captures both global and local dependencies in the audio
signal, crucial for source tracing. The proposed ensemble score-embedding
fusion shows an optimal trade-off between in-domain and out-of-domain source
tracing scenarios. We evaluate our method using Frechet Distance and standard
metrics, demonstrating superior performance in source tracing over the baseline
system.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AVSR模型在理想化场景中表现良好，但忽略了真实环境中说话和沉默面部片段的复杂性。

Method: 引入了一个新的音频-视觉鸡尾酒会数据集，包含1526小时的数据，涵盖说话和沉默面部片段。

Result: 在极端噪声环境下，WER相对降低了67%，从119%降至39.2%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了AVSR在真实噪声环境中的性能，无需依赖显式分割线索。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) offers a robust solution for speech
recognition in challenging environments, such as cocktail-party scenarios,
where relying solely on audio proves insufficient. However, current AVSR models
are often optimized for idealized scenarios with consistently active speakers,
overlooking the complexities of real-world settings that include both speaking
and silent facial segments. This study addresses this gap by introducing a
novel audio-visual cocktail-party dataset designed to benchmark current AVSR
systems and highlight the limitations of prior approaches in realistic noisy
conditions. Additionally, we contribute a 1526-hour AVSR dataset comprising
both talking-face and silent-face segments, enabling significant performance
gains in cocktail-party environments. Our approach reduces WER by 67% relative
to the state-of-the-art, reducing WER from 119% to 39.2% in extreme noise,
without relying on explicit segmentation cues.

Abstract: This paper addresses source tracing in synthetic speech-identifying

pipelines. While prior work focuses on spoofing detection, source tracing lacks
robust solutions. We evaluate two approaches: classification-based and
metric-learning. We tested our methods on the MLAADv5 benchmark using ResNet
and self-supervised learning (SSL) backbones. The results show that ResNet
achieves competitive performance with the metric learning approach, matching

Abstract: In speaker diarization, traditional clustering-based methods remain widely
used in real-world applications. However, these methods struggle with the
complex distribution of speaker embeddings and overlapping speech segments. To
address these limitations, we propose an Overlapping Community Detection method
based on Graph Attention networks and the Label Propagation Algorithm
(OCDGALP). The proposed framework comprises two key components: (1) a graph
attention network that refines speaker embeddings and node connections by
aggregating information from neighboring nodes, and (2) a label propagation
algorithm that assigns multiple community labels to each node, enabling
simultaneous clustering and overlapping community detection. Experimental
results show that the proposed method significantly reduces the Diarization
Error Rate (DER), achieving a state-of-the-art 15.94% DER on the DIHARD-III
dataset without oracle Voice Activity Detection (VAD), and an impressive 11.07%

Conclusion: MotionRAG-Diff通过结合检索与扩散模型，为音乐驱动舞蹈生成设定了新范式。

Abstract: Generating long-term, coherent, and realistic music-conditioned dance
sequences remains a challenging task in human motion synthesis. Existing
approaches exhibit critical limitations: motion graph methods rely on fixed
template libraries, restricting creative generation; diffusion models, while
capable of producing novel motions, often lack temporal coherence and musical
alignment. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{MotionRAG-Diff}$, a
hybrid framework that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with
diffusion-based refinement to enable high-quality, musically coherent dance
generation for arbitrary long-term music inputs. Our method introduces three
core innovations: (1) A cross-modal contrastive learning architecture that
aligns heterogeneous music and dance representations in a shared latent space,
establishing unsupervised semantic correspondence without paired data; (2) An
optimized motion graph system for efficient retrieval and seamless
concatenation of motion segments, ensuring realism and temporal coherence
across long sequences; (3) A multi-condition diffusion model that jointly
conditions on raw music signals and contrastive features to enhance motion
quality and global synchronization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MotionRAG-Diff achieves state-of-the-art performance in motion quality,
diversity, and music-motion synchronization accuracy. This work establishes a
new paradigm for music-driven dance generation by synergizing retrieval-based
template fidelity with diffusion-based creative enhancement.

Abstract: Language-queried Audio Source Separation (LASS) enables open-vocabulary sound
separation via natural language queries. While existing methods rely on
task-specific training, we explore whether pretrained diffusion models,
originally designed for audio generation, can inherently perform separation
without further training. In this study, we introduce a training-free framework
leveraging generative priors for zero-shot LASS. Analyzing na\"ive adaptations,
we identify key limitations arising from modality-specific challenges.To
address these issues, we propose Diffusion-Guided Mask Optimization (DGMO), a
test-time optimization framework that refines spectrogram masks for precise,
input-aligned separation. Our approach effectively repurposes pretrained
diffusion models for source separation, achieving competitive performance
without task-specific supervision. This work expands the application of
diffusion models beyond generation, establishing a new paradigm for zero-shot
audio separation. The code is available at: https://wltschmrz.github.io/DGMO/

Result: 数值实验表明，新方法在建模精度和性能上优于传统非结构化方法。

Conclusion: 新方法有效解决了动态系统建模中的微分结构保留问题，为实际应用提供了灵活选择。

Abstract: The data-driven modeling of dynamical systems has become an essential tool
for the construction of accurate computational models from real-world data. In
this process, the inherent differential structures underlying the considered
physical phenomena are often neglected making the reinterpretation of the
learned models in a physically meaningful sense very challenging. In this work,
we present three data-driven modeling approaches for the construction of
dynamical systems with second-order differential structure directly from
frequency domain data. Based on the second-order structured barycentric form,
we extend the well-known Adaptive Antoulas-Anderson algorithm to the case of
second-order systems. Depending on the available computational resources, we
propose variations of the proposed method that prioritize either higher
computation speed or greater modeling accuracy, and we present a theoretical
analysis for the expected accuracy and performance of the proposed methods.
Three numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our new structured
approaches in comparison to classical unstructured data-driven modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统雷达模拟方法依赖详细硬件规格或生成式模型，SA-Radar旨在结合两者优势，提供更灵活高效的模拟方案。

Method: 设计了ICFAR-Net（3D U-Net），通过波形参数编码雷达属性，支持多样传感器设置下的雷达张量模拟。

Result: 实验表明SA-Radar生成的数据在多项任务（如目标检测、语义分割）中表现优异，提升模型性能。

Conclusion: SA-Radar展示了作为自动驾驶通用雷达数据引擎的潜力，支持新视角和场景编辑。

Abstract: We present SA-Radar (Simulate Any Radar), a radar simulation approach that
enables controllable and efficient generation of radar cubes conditioned on
customizable radar attributes. Unlike prior generative or physics-based
simulators, SA-Radar integrates both paradigms through a waveform-parameterized
attribute embedding. We design ICFAR-Net, a 3D U-Net conditioned on radar
attributes encoded via waveform parameters, which captures signal variations
induced by different radar configurations. This formulation bypasses the need
for detailed radar hardware specifications and allows efficient simulation of
range-azimuth-Doppler (RAD) tensors across diverse sensor settings. We further
construct a mixed real-simulated dataset with attribute annotations to robustly
train the network. Extensive evaluations on multiple downstream tasks-including
2D/3D object detection and radar semantic segmentation-demonstrate that
SA-Radar's simulated data is both realistic and effective, consistently
improving model performance when used standalone or in combination with real
data. Our framework also supports simulation in novel sensor viewpoints and
edited scenes, showcasing its potential as a general-purpose radar data engine
for autonomous driving applications. Code and additional materials are

Abstract: We propose a recursive Bayesian estimation procedure for multivariate
autoregressive models with exogenous inputs based on message passing in a
factor graph. Unlike recursive least-squares, our method produces full
posterior distributions for both the autoregressive coefficients and noise
precision. The uncertainties regarding these estimates propagate into the
uncertainties on predictions for future system outputs, and support online
model evidence calculations. We demonstrate convergence empirically on a
synthetic autoregressive system and competitive performance on a double

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为C2E的自监督框架，利用Kolmogorov复杂度从手术视频中学习紧凑且信息丰富的表示，无需标注数据即可提升编码器性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于标注成本高昂，医学领域缺乏大规模标注数据集，监督学习方法受限。现有自监督方法难以捕捉通用任务的结构和物理信息。

Method: C2E框架通过熵最大化解码器压缩图像，保留临床相关细节，学习紧凑表示。

Result: C2E在多种手术ML任务（如工作流分类、工具-组织交互分类、分割和诊断）中表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: C2E展示了自监督学习在提升手术AI性能和改善微创手术结果方面的潜力。

Abstract: Real-time video understanding is critical to guide procedures in minimally
invasive surgery (MIS). However, supervised learning approaches require large,
annotated datasets that are scarce due to annotation efforts that are
prohibitive, e.g., in medical fields. Although self-supervision methods can
address such limitations, current self-supervised methods often fail to capture
structural and physical information in a form that generalizes across tasks. We
propose Compress-to-Explore (C2E), a novel self-supervised framework that
leverages Kolmogorov complexity to learn compact, informative representations
from surgical videos. C2E uses entropy-maximizing decoders to compress images
while preserving clinically relevant details, improving encoder performance
without labeled data. Trained on large-scale unlabeled surgical datasets, C2E
demonstrates strong generalization across a variety of surgical ML tasks, such
as workflow classification, tool-tissue interaction classification,
segmentation, and diagnosis tasks, providing improved performance as a surgical
visual foundation model. As we further show in the paper, the model's internal
compact representation better disentangles features from different structural
parts of images. The resulting performance improvements highlight the yet
untapped potential of self-supervised learning to enhance surgical AI and
improve outcomes in MIS.

Abstract: Previous works in the literature apply 3D spatial-only models on 4D
functional MRI data leading to possible sub-par feature extraction to be used
for downstream tasks like classification. In this work, we aim to develop a
novel 4D convolution network to extract 4D joint temporal-spatial kernels that
not only learn spatial information but in addition also capture temporal
dynamics. Experimental results show promising performance in capturing
spatial-temporal data in functional MRI compared to 3D models. The 4D CNN model
improves Alzheimers disease diagnosis for rs-fMRI data, enabling earlier

TL;DR: 提出了一套新的解剖学感知评估指标和CARE框架，显著提升了CT重建中关键结构的完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标（如SSIM和PSNR）难以捕捉关键解剖结构的完整性，特别是小或薄区域。

Method: 提出解剖学感知评估指标，并开发CARE框架，通过结构惩罚训练提升解剖结构完整性。

Result: CARE显著改善了CT重建的结构完整性，大器官提升32%，小器官22%，肠道40%，血管36%。

Conclusion: CARE框架有效解决了传统指标忽略解剖完整性的问题，适用于多种重建方法。

Abstract: Widely adopted evaluation metrics for sparse-view CT reconstruction--such as
Structural Similarity Index Measure and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio--prioritize
pixel-wise fidelity but often fail to capture the completeness of critical
anatomical structures, particularly small or thin regions that are easily
missed. To address this limitation, we propose a suite of novel anatomy-aware
evaluation metrics designed to assess structural completeness across anatomical
structures, including large organs, small organs, intestines, and vessels.
Building on these metrics, we introduce CARE, a Completeness-Aware
Reconstruction Enhancement framework that incorporates structural penalties
during training to encourage anatomical preservation of significant structures.
CARE is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into analytical,
implicit, and generative methods. When applied to these methods, CARE
substantially improves structural completeness in CT reconstructions, achieving
up to +32% improvement for large organs, +22% for small organs, +40% for
intestines, and +36% for vessels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视网膜血管分割对诊断眼部和心血管疾病至关重要，但现有方法如U-Net仍面临训练数据不足、数据分布不平衡和特征提取不足等问题，限制了分割性能和模型泛化。

Method: DEFFA-Unet通过增加编码器处理域不变预处理输入，开发特征过滤融合模块，替换传统跳跃连接为注意力引导的特征重建融合模块，并提出创新的数据增强和平衡方法。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的验证表明，该方法在分割性能和模型泛化方面优于基线和最先进模型，尤其在交叉验证中表现突出。

Conclusion: DEFFA-Unet通过改进特征提取和数据增强方法，显著提升了视网膜血管分割的性能和泛化能力，为相关疾病的诊断提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Retinal blood vessel segmentation is crucial for diagnosing ocular and
cardiovascular diseases. Although the introduction of U-Net in 2015 by Olaf
Ronneberger significantly advanced this field, yet issues like limited training
data, imbalance data distribution, and inadequate feature extraction persist,
hindering both the segmentation performance and optimal model generalization.
Addressing these critical issues, the DEFFA-Unet is proposed featuring an
additional encoder to process domain-invariant pre-processed inputs, thereby
improving both richer feature encoding and enhanced model generalization. A
feature filtering fusion module is developed to ensure the precise feature
filtering and robust hybrid feature fusion. In response to the task-specific
need for higher precision where false positives are very costly, traditional
skip connections are replaced with the attention-guided feature reconstructing
fusion module. Additionally, innovative data augmentation and balancing methods
are proposed to counter data scarcity and distribution imbalance, further
boosting the robustness and generalization of the model. With a comprehensive
suite of evaluation metrics, extensive validations on four benchmark datasets
(DRIVE, CHASEDB1, STARE, and HRF) and an SLO dataset (IOSTAR), demonstrate the
proposed method's superiority over both baseline and state-of-the-art models.
Particularly the proposed method significantly outperforms the compared methods
in cross-validation model generalization.

Motivation: 临床CT场景中，噪声和伪影问题严重，深度学习虽有效但数据配对困难，且存在幻觉风险。

Method: 结合数据保真度和PFGM++生成模型，提出FORCE框架。

Result: 在各种CT任务中表现优异，超越现有无监督方法。

Conclusion: FORCE框架为CT重建提供了高效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is a major medical imaging modality. Clinical CT
scenarios, such as low-dose screening, sparse-view scanning, and metal
implants, often lead to severe noise and artifacts in reconstructed images,
requiring improved reconstruction techniques. The introduction of deep learning
has significantly advanced CT image reconstruction. However, obtaining paired
training data remains rather challenging due to patient motion and other
constraints. Although deep learning methods can still perform well with
approximately paired data, they inherently carry the risk of hallucination due
to data inconsistencies and model instability. In this paper, we integrate the
data fidelity with the state-of-the-art generative AI model, referred to as the
Poisson flow generative model (PFGM) with a generalized version PFGM++, and
propose a novel CT framework: Flow-Oriented Reconstruction Conditioning Engine
(FORCE). In our experiments, the proposed method shows superior performance in
various CT imaging tasks, outperforming existing unsupervised reconstruction
approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的非凸全变分项（NC-GTV）用于图像去噪，通过图Huber函数确保目标函数凸性，并设计线性时间算法优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于模型的图像去噪方法使用凸正则化项（如TV），但存在局限性。本文旨在通过非凸全变分项提升稀疏信号表示能力。

Method: 定义NC-GTV为图Huber函数，确保目标函数凸性；通过Gershgorin Circle Theorem计算参数a；设计基于ADMM的线性时间算法，并将其展开为轻量级前馈网络。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在图像去噪性能上优于传统方法，且网络参数更少。

Conclusion: NC-GTV结合图Huber函数和ADMM算法，提供了一种高效且性能优越的图像去噪方案。

Abstract: Conventional model-based image denoising optimizations employ convex
regularization terms, such as total variation (TV) that convexifies the
$\ell_0$-norm to promote sparse signal representation. Instead, we propose a
new non-convex total variation term in a graph setting (NC-GTV), such that when
combined with an $\ell_2$-norm fidelity term for denoising, leads to a convex
objective with no extraneous local minima. We define NC-GTV using a new graph
variant of the Huber function, interpretable as a Moreau envelope. The crux is
the selection of a parameter $a$ characterizing the graph Huber function that
ensures overall objective convexity; we efficiently compute $a$ via an
adaptation of Gershgorin Circle Theorem (GCT). To minimize the convex
objective, we design a linear-time algorithm based on Alternating Direction
Method of Multipliers (ADMM) and unroll it into a lightweight feed-forward
network for data-driven parameter learning. Experiments show that our method
outperforms unrolled GTV and other representative image denoising schemes,
while employing far fewer network parameters.

Result: 实验表明，SwinUNETR在图像质量、解剖一致性和诊断价值上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: SwinUNETR是一种有效的脑MRI缺失模态合成方法，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Multi-modal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in
clinical diagnostics by providing complementary information across different
imaging modalities. However, a common challenge in clinical practice is missing
MRI modalities. In this paper, we apply SwinUNETR to the synthesize of missing
modalities in brain MRI. SwinUNETR is a novel neural network architecture
designed for medical image analysis, integrating the strengths of Swin
Transformer and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The Swin Transformer, a
variant of the Vision Transformer (ViT), incorporates hierarchical feature
extraction and window-based self-attention mechanisms, enabling it to capture
both local and global contextual information effectively. By combining the Swin
Transformer with CNNs, SwinUNETR merges global context awareness with detailed
spatial resolution. This hybrid approach addresses the challenges posed by the
varying modality characteristics and complex brain structures, facilitating the
generation of accurate and realistic synthetic images. We evaluate the
performance of SwinUNETR on brain MRI datasets and demonstrate its superior
capability in generating clinically valuable images. Our results show
significant improvements in image quality, anatomical consistency, and
diagnostic value.

Conclusion: TSRNet通过树结构和跨域信息提取显著提升了图像超分辨率性能。

Abstract: Deep convolutional neural networks can extract more accurate structural
information via deep architectures to obtain good performance in image
super-resolution. However, it is not easy to find effect of important layers in
a single network architecture to decrease performance of super-resolution. In
this paper, we design a tree-guided CNN for image super-resolution (TSRNet). It
uses a tree architecture to guide a deep network to enhance effect of key nodes
to amplify the relation of hierarchical information for improving the ability
of recovering images. To prevent insufficiency of the obtained structural
information, cosine transform techniques in the TSRNet are used to extract
cross-domain information to improve the performance of image super-resolution.
Adaptive Nesterov momentum optimizer (Adan) is applied to optimize parameters
to boost effectiveness of training a super-resolution model. Extended
experiments can verify superiority of the proposed TSRNet for restoring

Method: TransAct V2采用长用户序列、Next Action Loss函数和低延迟部署方案。

Result: 模型提升了CTR预测能力和用户动作预测准确性。

Conclusion: TransAct V2通过创新方法解决了工业推荐系统的关键问题。

Abstract: Modeling user action sequences has become a popular focus in industrial
recommendation system research, particularly for Click-Through Rate (CTR)
prediction tasks. However, industry-scale CTR models often rely on short user
sequences, limiting their ability to capture long-term behavior. Additionally,
these models typically lack an integrated action-prediction task within a
point-wise ranking framework, reducing their predictive power. They also rarely
address the infrastructure challenges involved in efficiently serving
large-scale sequential models. In this paper, we introduce TransAct V2, a
production model for Pinterest's Homefeed ranking system, featuring three key
innovations: (1) leveraging very long user sequences to improve CTR
predictions, (2) integrating a Next Action Loss function for enhanced user
action forecasting, and (3) employing scalable, low-latency deployment
solutions tailored to handle the computational demands of extended user action
sequences.

Conclusion: 该方法为CDE协调提供了实用解决方案，提高了选择效率并支持数据互操作性。

Abstract: This research aims to develop a dynamic and scalable framework to facilitate
harmonization of Common Data Elements (CDEs) across heterogeneous biomedical
datasets by addressing challenges such as semantic heterogeneity, structural
variability, and context dependence to streamline integration, enhance
interoperability, and accelerate scientific discovery. Our methodology
leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for context-aware text embeddings that
convert CDEs into dense vectors capturing semantic relationships and patterns.
These embeddings are clustered using Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial
Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) to group semantically similar
CDEs. The framework incorporates four key steps: (1) LLM-based text embedding
to mathematically represent semantic context, (2) unsupervised clustering of
embeddings via HDBSCAN, (3) automated labeling using LLM summarization, and (4)
supervised learning to train a classifier assigning new or unclustered CDEs to
labeled clusters. Evaluated on the NIH NLM CDE Repository with over 24,000
CDEs, the system identified 118 meaningful clusters at an optimized minimum
cluster size of 20. The classifier achieved 90.46 percent overall accuracy,
performing best in larger categories. External validation against Gravity
Projects Social Determinants of Health domains showed strong agreement
(Adjusted Rand Index 0.52, Normalized Mutual Information 0.78), indicating that
embeddings effectively capture cluster characteristics. This adaptable and
scalable approach offers a practical solution to CDE harmonization, improving
selection efficiency and supporting ongoing data interoperability.

TL;DR: RecPO是一个基于偏好优化的框架，通过模拟人类决策的灵活性和上下文感知能力，提升序列推荐系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的推荐系统未能充分模拟人类动态、结构化和上下文感知的决策机制。

Method: RecPO利用自适应奖励边界和时序信号，建模偏好层次和上下文延迟，以区分不同偏好和厌恶程度。

Result: 在五个真实数据集上的实验表明，RecPO性能优于现有基线，并能模拟人类决策的关键特征。

Conclusion: RecPO不仅提升了推荐性能，还更好地模拟了人类决策的动态性和上下文感知能力。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation systems aspire to profile users by interpreting
their interaction histories, echoing how humans make decisions by weighing
experience, relative preference strength, and situational relevance. Yet,
existing large language model (LLM)-based recommenders often fall short of
mimicking the flexible, context-aware decision strategies humans exhibit,
neglecting the structured, dynamic, and context-aware mechanisms fundamental to
human behaviors. To bridge this gap, we propose RecPO, a preference
optimization framework that models structured feedback and contextual delay to
emulate human-like prioritization in sequential recommendation RecPO exploits
adaptive reward margins based on inferred preference hierarchies and temporal
signals, enabling the model to favor immediately relevant items and to
distinguish between varying degrees of preference and aversion. Extensive
experiments across five real-world datasets demonstrate that RecPO not only
yields performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines, but also mirrors key
characteristics of human decision-making: favoring timely satisfaction,
maintaining coherent preferences, and exercising discernment under shifting
contexts.

do not reflect the complexity of real-world shopping scenarios, as they often
consist of overly simple queries with deterministic paths, such as "Find iPhone
15." Real shopping scenarios are inherently more layered, involving
multi-dimensional product attributes, search filters, and user-specific sorting
preferences. To address this gap, we introduce DeepShop, a benchmark designed
to evaluate web agents in complex and realistic online shopping environments.
DeepShop comprises three key components. (1) Query diversity evolution:
Starting from real user queries, we generate diverse queries across five
popular online shopping domains. (2) Query complexity evolution: We further
evolve these queries to increase complexity, considering product attributes,
search filters, and sorting preferences, and classify them into three levels:
easy, medium, and hard, based on the number of evolutions. (3) Fine-grained and
holistic evaluation: We propose an automated evaluation framework that assesses
agent performance in terms of fine-grained aspects (product attributes, search
filters, and sorting preferences) and reports the overall success rate through
holistic evaluation. We conduct a systematic evaluation of retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) methods, web agents, and deep research systems. Results show
that RAG struggles with complex queries due to its lack of web interaction,
while other methods face significant challenges with filters and sorting
preferences, leading to low overall success rates. We also perform
cross-category, complexity-based evaluations and error analyses to support the
advancement of deep research shopping agents.
