### [1] [Specification Self-Correction: Mitigating In-Context Reward Hacking Through Test-Time Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18742)
*Víctor Gallego*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Specification Self-Correction (SSC)的框架，用于帮助语言模型在推理时自我识别并修正其指导规范中的缺陷，从而避免奖励滥用行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型容易利用有缺陷的规范或评分标准（即奖励滥用）来获得高分，而未能满足用户的真实意图。为了解决这一问题，作者提出了SSC框架。

Method: SSC采用多步推理过程：模型首先生成基于可能有缺陷的规范的响应，然后对其输出进行批判性分析，并修正规范以消除可被利用的漏洞，最后生成更稳健的响应。

Result: 实验表明，SSC能将语言模型对缺陷规范的滥用率从50-70%降低90%以上，且无需修改模型权重。

Conclusion: SSC框架在推理时动态修复规范缺陷，显著提升了模型行为的稳健性和对齐性。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are susceptible to in-context reward hacking, where
they exploit flaws in tainted or faulty written specifications or rubrics to
achieve high scores without fulfilling the user's true intent. We introduce
Specification Self-Correction (SSC), a novel, test-time framework that enables
an LM to identify and correct flaws within its own guiding specification. SSC
employs a multi-step inference process where the model first generates a
response based on a potentially tainted specification, critiques its output,
and then revises the specification itself to remove the exploitable loophole. A
final, more robust response is then generated using this self-corrected
specification. Across experiments spanning creative writing and agentic coding
tasks with several LMs, we demonstrate that while models initially game tainted
specifications in 50-70\% of cases, the SSC process reduces this vulnerability
by over 90\%. This dynamic repair occurs at inference time, requires no weight
modification, and leads to more robustly aligned model behavior. Code at

### [2] [The Role of Orthographic Consistency in Multilingual Embedding Models for Text Classification in Arabic-Script Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18762)
*Abdulhady Abas Abdullah,Amir H. Gandomi,Tarik A Rashid,Seyedali Mirjalili,Laith Abualigah,Milena Živković,Hadi Veisi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AS-RoBERTa模型针对阿拉伯文字语言优化，通过语言特定的预训练，在分类任务中表现优于通用模型mBERT和XLM-RoBERTa。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言模型在处理共享文字但拼写规则和文化背景不同的语言（如库尔德语、阿拉伯语、波斯语和乌尔都语）时的性能不足问题。

Method: 开发了四种基于RoBERTa的AS-RoBERTa模型，每种模型针对特定语言进行大规模语料库预训练，专注于语言特定的文字特征和统计信息。

Result: AS-RoBERTa在分类任务中比mBERT和XLM-RoBERTa性能提升2至5个百分点，消融实验证实文字聚焦的预训练是关键。

Conclusion: 研究表明，针对阿拉伯文字的语言特定预训练策略具有显著优势，支持进一步基于文字和语言特性的预训练研究。

Abstract: In natural language processing, multilingual models like mBERT and
XLM-RoBERTa promise broad coverage but often struggle with languages that share
a script yet differ in orthographic norms and cultural context. This issue is
especially notable in Arabic-script languages such as Kurdish Sorani, Arabic,
Persian, and Urdu. We introduce the Arabic Script RoBERTa (AS-RoBERTa) family:
four RoBERTa-based models, each pre-trained on a large corpus tailored to its
specific language. By focusing pre-training on language-specific script
features and statistics, our models capture patterns overlooked by
general-purpose models. When fine-tuned on classification tasks, AS-RoBERTa
variants outperform mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa by 2 to 5 percentage points. An
ablation study confirms that script-focused pre-training is central to these
gains. Error analysis using confusion matrices shows how shared script traits
and domain-specific content affect performance. Our results highlight the value
of script-aware specialization for languages using the Arabic script and
support further work on pre-training strategies rooted in script and language
specificity.

### [3] [ylmmcl at Multilingual Text Detoxification 2025: Lexicon-Guided Detoxification and Classifier-Gated Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18769)
*Nicole Lai-Lopez,Lusha Wang,Su Yuan,Liza Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种多语言文本去毒解决方案，结合词典引导标记、微调序列到序列模型和迭代分类器门控机制，在多语言任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言文本去毒问题，提升去毒精度和跨语言泛化能力。

Method: 整合词典引导标记、微调序列到序列模型（s-nlp/mt0-xl-detox-orpo）和迭代分类器门控机制。

Result: 在STA（0.922）和J分数（0.612）上表现最佳，xCOMET分数为0.793（开发集）和0.787（测试集），优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在多语言去毒任务中表现优异，尤其在英语、俄语和法语中泛化能力强，团队在比赛中获得第九名。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce our solution for the Multilingual Text
Detoxification Task in the PAN-2025 competition for the ylmmcl team: a robust
multilingual text detoxification pipeline that integrates lexicon-guided
tagging, a fine-tuned sequence-to-sequence model (s-nlp/mt0-xl-detox-orpo) and
an iterative classifier-based gatekeeping mechanism. Our approach departs from
prior unsupervised or monolingual pipelines by leveraging explicit toxic word
annotation via the multilingual_toxic_lexicon to guide detoxification with
greater precision and cross-lingual generalization. Our final model achieves
the highest STA (0.922) from our previous attempts, and an average official J
score of 0.612 for toxic inputs in both the development and test sets. It also
achieved xCOMET scores of 0.793 (dev) and 0.787 (test). This performance
outperforms baseline and backtranslation methods across multiple languages, and
shows strong generalization in high-resource settings (English, Russian,
French). Despite some trade-offs in SIM, the model demonstrates consistent
improvements in detoxification strength. In the competition, our team achieved
ninth place with a score of 0.612.

### [4] [Evaluating Code-Mixing in LLMs Across 18 Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18791)
*Yilun Yang,Yekun Chai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了代码混合（多语言切换）对自然语言处理的挑战，评估了LLMs在18种语言中的表现，并提出了一种新的合成代码混合文本的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准如LinCE和GLUECoS在语言对和任务上有限，无法充分评估LLMs的代码混合能力，且当前生成代码混合数据的方法不成熟。

Method: 通过结合单词替换和GPT-4提示生成合成代码混合文本，并对18种语言的LLMs表现进行全面评估。

Result: LLMs在涉及多语言家族的代码混合数据集上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 建议通过增加训练数据规模、模型规模和少样本学习来提升LLMs在代码混合任务中的表现。

Abstract: Code-mixing, the practice of switching between languages within a
conversation, presents unique challenges for traditional natural language
processing. Existing benchmarks, such as LinCE and GLUECoS, are limited by
narrow language pairings and tasks, failing to adequately evaluate the
code-mixing capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite the
significance of code-mixing for multilingual users, research on LLMs in this
context remains limited. Additionally, current methods for generating
code-mixed data are underdeveloped. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of LLMs' performance on code-mixed data across 18 languages from
seven language families. We also propose a novel approach for generating
synthetic code-mixed texts by combining word substitution with GPT-4 prompting.
Our analysis reveals consistent underperformance of LLMs on code-mixed datasets
involving multiple language families. We suggest that improvements in training
data size, model scale, and few-shot learning could enhance their performance.

### [5] [CueBuddy: helping non-native English speakers navigate English-centric STEM education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18827)
*Pranav Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CueBuddy提供实时词汇提示，帮助非英语母语的STEM学生理解复杂术语，而不打断课堂注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球南部的STEM学生在英语术语上落后于英语流利的同学，尽管科学基础相当。

Method: 通过实时技术关键词识别和多语言词汇表查询，提供实时词汇提示。

Result: CueBuddy帮助学生跟上复杂英语术语，不干扰课堂专注。

Conclusion: 该方法有效但存在局限性，未来可扩展。

Abstract: Students across the world in STEM classes, especially in the Global South,
fall behind their peers who are more fluent in English, despite being at par
with them in terms of scientific prerequisites. While many of them are able to
follow everyday English at ease, key terms in English stay challenging. In most
cases, such students have had most of their course prerequisites in a lower
resource language. Live speech translation to lower resource languages is a
promising area of research, however, models for speech translation can be too
expensive on a large scale and often struggle with technical content. In this
paper, we describe CueBuddy, which aims to remediate these issues by providing
real-time "lexical cues" through technical keyword spotting along real-time
multilingual glossary lookup to help students stay up to speed with complex
English jargon without disrupting their concentration on the lecture. We also
describe the limitations and future extensions of our approach.

### [6] [PrismRAG: Boosting RAG Factuality with Distractor Resilience and Strategized Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18857)
*Mohammad Kachuee,Teja Gollapudi,Minseok Kim,Yin Huang,Kai Sun,Xiao Yang,Jiaqi Wang,Nirav Shah,Yue Liu,Aaron Colak,Anuj Kumar,Wen-tau Yih,Xin Luna Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PrismRAG是一个高效的微调框架，通过训练模型处理干扰性QA对和培养推理习惯，显著提升了RAG在开放书问答任务中的事实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG在检索到半相关或干扰性内容时表现不佳的问题，以及需要深度上下文理解和推理的任务。

Method: 提出PrismRAG框架，包括训练模型处理干扰性QA对和培养推理习惯，减少对人工指令的依赖。

Result: 在12个开放书RAG QA基准测试中，平均事实性提升5.4%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PrismRAG通过高效微调和推理习惯培养，显著提升了RAG的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) often falls short when retrieved context
includes confusing semi-relevant passages, or when answering questions require
deep contextual understanding and reasoning. We propose an efficient
fine-tuning framework, called PrismRAG, that (i) trains the model with
distractor-aware QA pairs mixing gold evidence with subtle distractor passages,
and (ii) instills reasoning-centric habits that make the LLM plan, rationalize,
and synthesize without relying on extensive human engineered instructions.
Evaluated across 12 open-book RAG QA benchmarks spanning diverse application
domains and scenarios, PrismRAG improves average factuality by 5.4%,
outperforming state-of-the-art solutions.

### [7] [MindFlow+: A Self-Evolving Agent for E-Commerce Customer Service](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18884)
*Ming Gong,Xucheng Huang,Ziheng Xu,Vijayan K. Asari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MindFlow+结合大型语言模型、模仿学习和离线强化学习，通过工具增强演示和奖励条件数据建模，提升电商对话系统的上下文相关性和任务准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于意图的对话系统难以应对动态多轮交互，需要更灵活、领域专用的解决方案。

Method: 结合LLMs、模仿学习和离线RL，引入工具增强演示和奖励条件数据建模。

Result: 在真实电商对话中，MindFlow+在上下文相关性、灵活性和任务准确性上优于基线。

Conclusion: 结合LLMs、工具推理和奖励引导学习，可构建领域专用、上下文感知的对话系统。

Abstract: High-quality dialogue is crucial for e-commerce customer service, yet
traditional intent-based systems struggle with dynamic, multi-turn
interactions. We present MindFlow+, a self-evolving dialogue agent that learns
domain-specific behavior by combining large language models (LLMs) with
imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning (RL). MindFlow+
introduces two data-centric mechanisms to guide learning: tool-augmented
demonstration construction, which exposes the model to knowledge-enhanced and
agentic (ReAct-style) interactions for effective tool use; and
reward-conditioned data modeling, which aligns responses with task-specific
goals using reward signals. To evaluate the model's role in response
generation, we introduce the AI Contribution Ratio, a novel metric quantifying
AI involvement in dialogue. Experiments on real-world e-commerce conversations
show that MindFlow+ outperforms strong baselines in contextual relevance,
flexibility, and task accuracy. These results demonstrate the potential of
combining LLMs tool reasoning, and reward-guided learning to build
domain-specialized, context-aware dialogue systems.

### [8] [NUTMEG: Separating Signal From Noise in Annotator Disagreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18890)
*Jonathan Ivey,Susan Gauch,David Jurgens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NUTMEG是一个新的贝叶斯模型，通过结合标注者背景信息，从人工标注数据中去除噪声，同时保留系统性分歧，显著优于传统聚合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法假设标注分歧为错误，但实际分歧可能是真实的信号而非噪声，需要区分信号与噪声。

Method: 提出NUTMEG模型，利用标注者背景信息去除噪声并保留系统性分歧，通过合成数据验证其有效性。

Result: NUTMEG在恢复真实标注上优于传统方法，下游模型性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 在人工标注数据训练中，需同时考虑标注者能力和系统性分歧。

Abstract: NLP models often rely on human-labeled data for training and evaluation. Many
approaches crowdsource this data from a large number of annotators with varying
skills, backgrounds, and motivations, resulting in conflicting annotations.
These conflicts have traditionally been resolved by aggregation methods that
assume disagreements are errors. Recent work has argued that for many tasks
annotators may have genuine disagreements and that variation should be treated
as signal rather than noise. However, few models separate signal and noise in
annotator disagreement. In this work, we introduce NUTMEG, a new Bayesian model
that incorporates information about annotator backgrounds to remove noisy
annotations from human-labeled training data while preserving systematic
disagreements. Using synthetic data, we show that NUTMEG is more effective at
recovering ground-truth from annotations with systematic disagreement than
traditional aggregation methods. We provide further analysis characterizing how
differences in subpopulation sizes, rates of disagreement, and rates of spam
affect the performance of our model. Finally, we demonstrate that downstream
models trained on NUTMEG-aggregated data significantly outperform models
trained on data from traditionally aggregation methods. Our results highlight
the importance of accounting for both annotator competence and systematic
disagreements when training on human-labeled data.

### [9] [REPRO-Bench: Can Agentic AI Systems Assess the Reproducibility of Social Science Research?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18901)
*Chuxuan Hu,Liyun Zhang,Yeji Lim,Aum Wadhwani,Austin Peters,Daniel Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REPRO-Bench是一个评估AI代理自动化社会科学论文可重复性的新基准，解决了现有基准的不足，并展示了现有代理的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI代理在自动化社会科学论文可重复性评估中的能力，填补现有基准的不足。

Method: 引入REPRO-Bench，包含112个任务实例，评估AI代理基于原始论文和复现包的可重复性。

Result: 最佳代理准确率仅21.4%，开发的REPRO-Agent将准确率提升71%。

Conclusion: 需开发更先进的AI代理以自动化真实世界的可重复性评估。

Abstract: Assessing the reproducibility of social science papers is essential for
promoting rigor in research processes, but manual assessment is costly. With
recent advances in agentic AI systems (i.e., AI agents), we seek to evaluate
their capability to automate this process. However, existing benchmarks for
reproducing research papers (1) focus solely on reproducing results using
provided code and data without assessing their consistency with the paper, (2)
oversimplify real-world scenarios, and (3) lack necessary diversity in data
formats and programming languages. To address these issues, we introduce
REPRO-Bench, a collection of 112 task instances, each representing a social
science paper with a publicly available reproduction report. The agents are
tasked with assessing the reproducibility of the paper based on the original
paper PDF and the corresponding reproduction package. REPRO-Bench features
end-to-end evaluation tasks on the reproducibility of social science papers
with complexity comparable to real-world assessments. We evaluate three
representative AI agents on REPRO-Bench, with the best-performing agent
achieving an accuracy of only 21.4%. Building on our empirical analysis, we
develop REPRO-Agent, which improves the highest accuracy achieved by existing
agents by 71%. We conclude that more advanced AI agents should be developed to
automate real-world reproducibility assessment. REPRO-Bench is publicly
available at https://github.com/uiuc-kang-lab/REPRO-Bench.

### [10] [SLoW: Select Low-frequency Words! Automatic Dictionary Selection for Translation on Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18902)
*Hongyuan Lu,Zixuan Li,Zefan Zhang,Wai Lam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为自动词典选择（ADS）的新任务，旨在通过选择低频词典来优化翻译性能和减少token消耗。提出的SLoW方法无需训练数据，实验证明其优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）仅支持数百种语言，而全球有7000多种语言。词典提示方法虽能提升翻译效果，但通常使用全部词典成本高昂。因此，需要在token消耗和翻译性能之间找到平衡。

Method: 提出SLoW方法，自动选择低频词典以提升翻译效果。该方法无需训练数据，且无需对LLMs进行额外调优。

Result: 在FLORES的100种语言上实验表明，SLoW优于基线方法，显著节省token使用，部分语言甚至超越全词典基线的翻译性能。

Conclusion: SLoW方法通过低频词典选择，在无需训练数据和额外调优的情况下，有效提升了翻译性能并减少了资源消耗。

Abstract: There are more than 7,000 languages around the world, and current Large
Language Models (LLMs) only support hundreds of languages. Dictionary-based
prompting methods can enhance translation on them, but most methods use all the
available dictionaries, which could be expensive. Instead, it will be flexible
to have a trade-off between token consumption and translation performance. This
paper proposes a novel task called \textbf{A}utomatic \textbf{D}ictionary
\textbf{S}election (\textbf{ADS}). The goal of the task is to automatically
select which dictionary to use to enhance translation. We propose a novel and
effective method which we call \textbf{S}elect \textbf{Lo}w-frequency
\textbf{W}ords! (\textbf{SLoW}) which selects those dictionaries that have a
lower frequency. Our methods have unique advantages. First, there is no need
for access to the training data for frequency estimation (which is usually
unavailable). Second, it inherits the advantage of dictionary-based methods,
where no additional tuning is required on LLMs. Experimental results on 100
languages from FLORES indicate that SLoW surpasses strong baselines, and it can
obviously save token usage, with many languages even surpassing the translation
performance of the full dictionary baseline.\footnote{A shocking fact is that
there is no need to use the actual training data (often unobtainable) for
frequency estimation, and an estimation frequency obtained using public
resources is still apparently effective in improving translation with ChatGPT
and Llama, and DeepSeek.}\footnote{Code and data available upon publication.}

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究比较了四种公开可用的医疗聊天机器人的安全性，发现其回答中存在显著差异，部分回答可能对患者造成严重危害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数百万患者定期使用LLM聊天机器人获取医疗建议，引发患者安全问题，需评估其安全性。

Method: 通过红队测试，使用新数据集HealthAdvice评估四种聊天机器人的回答，进行定量和定性分析。

Result: 问题回答率从21.6%（Claude）到43.2%（Llama）不等，不安全回答率从5%（Claude）到13%（GPT-4o, Llama）。

Conclusion: 公开可用的聊天机器人可能提供不安全的医疗建议，需进一步改进其临床安全性。

Abstract: Millions of patients are already using large language model (LLM) chatbots
for medical advice on a regular basis, raising patient safety concerns. This
physician-led red-teaming study compares the safety of four publicly available
chatbots--Claude by Anthropic, Gemini by Google, GPT-4o by OpenAI, and
Llama3-70B by Meta--on a new dataset, HealthAdvice, using an evaluation
framework that enables quantitative and qualitative analysis. In total, 888
chatbot responses are evaluated for 222 patient-posed advice-seeking medical
questions on primary care topics spanning internal medicine, women's health,
and pediatrics. We find statistically significant differences between chatbots.
The rate of problematic responses varies from 21.6 percent (Claude) to 43.2
percent (Llama), with unsafe responses varying from 5 percent (Claude) to 13
percent (GPT-4o, Llama). Qualitative results reveal chatbot responses with the
potential to lead to serious patient harm. This study suggests that millions of
patients could be receiving unsafe medical advice from publicly available
chatbots, and further work is needed to improve the clinical safety of these
powerful tools.

*Agada Joseph Oche,Ademola Glory Folashade,Tirthankar Ghosal,Arpan Biswas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文综述了检索增强生成（RAG）在自然语言处理中的发展，分析了其技术组件、应用场景及挑战，并展望了未来方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG通过结合大型语言模型与信息检索系统，解决了参数模型中的幻觉和知识过时问题，提升了事实性和上下文相关性。

Method: 详细分析了RAG的核心技术组件（检索机制、序列生成模型、融合策略），并逐年梳理了关键里程碑和研究趋势。

Result: RAG在企业系统中的实际应用面临检索质量、隐私和扩展性等挑战，但新兴解决方案（如混合检索、隐私保护技术）显示出潜力。

Conclusion: RAG的未来发展将更注重可靠性、效率和上下文感知能力，推动知识密集型NLP系统的进步。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a major advancement in
natural language processing (NLP), combining large language models (LLMs) with
information retrieval systems to enhance factual grounding, accuracy, and
contextual relevance. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic review of
RAG, tracing its evolution from early developments in open domain question
answering to recent state-of-the-art implementations across diverse
applications. The review begins by outlining the motivations behind RAG,
particularly its ability to mitigate hallucinations and outdated knowledge in
parametric models. Core technical components-retrieval mechanisms,
sequence-to-sequence generation models, and fusion strategies are examined in
detail. A year-by-year analysis highlights key milestones and research trends,
providing insight into RAG's rapid growth. The paper further explores the
deployment of RAG in enterprise systems, addressing practical challenges
related to retrieval of proprietary data, security, and scalability. A
comparative evaluation of RAG implementations is conducted, benchmarking
performance on retrieval accuracy, generation fluency, latency, and
computational efficiency. Persistent challenges such as retrieval quality,
privacy concerns, and integration overhead are critically assessed. Finally,
the review highlights emerging solutions, including hybrid retrieval
approaches, privacy-preserving techniques, optimized fusion strategies, and
agentic RAG architectures. These innovations point toward a future of more
reliable, efficient, and context-aware knowledge-intensive NLP systems.

*Ananya Sahu,Amith Ananthram,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种从无标签数据集中挖掘视觉元素关联的方法，生成高质量创意标题，并构建新数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型依赖简短字面描述的网页数据，缺乏对创意输出的理解。

Method: 从图像中挖掘上下文关联，生成抽象程度递增的创意标题。

Result: 构建了包含170万创意标题的数据集，并在诗歌和隐喻可视化领域提升了零样本检索性能。

Conclusion: 方法有效生成视觉关联数据，提升创意领域任务表现，数据集和模型已开源。

Abstract: Understanding another person's creative output requires a shared language of
association. However, when training vision-language models such as CLIP, we
rely on web-scraped datasets containing short, predominantly literal, alt-text.
In this work, we introduce a method for mining contextualized associations for
salient visual elements in an image that can scale to any unlabeled dataset.
Given an image, we can use these mined associations to generate high quality
creative captions at increasing degrees of abstraction. With our method, we
produce a new dataset of visual associations and 1.7m creative captions for the
images in MSCOCO. Human evaluation confirms that these captions remain visually
grounded while exhibiting recognizably increasing abstraction. Moreover,
fine-tuning a visual encoder on this dataset yields meaningful improvements in
zero-shot image-text retrieval in two creative domains: poetry and metaphor
visualization. We release our dataset, our generation code and our models for
use by the broader community.

*Richmond Sin Jing Xuan,Jalil Huseynov,Yang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现多语言大模型在低资源语言上表现较差，通过激活模式分析和LoRA微调，显著提升了低资源语言的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究多语言大模型在低资源语言上表现不佳的原因，并提出改进方法。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器分析激活模式，并通过LoRA进行激活感知微调。

Result: 微调后低资源语言激活显著提升（如马拉雅拉姆语87.69%），同时保持英语性能（91%）。

Conclusion: 激活对齐是提升多语言大模型性能的关键因素。

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong cross-linguistic
generalization, yet medium to low resource languages underperform on common
benchmarks such as ARC-Challenge, MMLU, and HellaSwag. We analyze activation
patterns in Gemma-2-2B across all 26 residual layers and 10 languages: Chinese
(zh), Russian (ru), Spanish (es), Italian (it), medium to low resource
languages including Indonesian (id), Catalan (ca), Marathi (mr), Malayalam
(ml), and Hindi (hi), with English (en) as the reference. Using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs), we reveal systematic disparities in activation patterns.
Medium to low resource languages receive up to 26.27 percent lower activations
in early layers, with a persistent gap of 19.89 percent in deeper layers. To
address this, we apply activation-aware fine-tuning via Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), leading to substantial activation gains, such as 87.69 percent for
Malayalam and 86.32 percent for Hindi, while maintaining English retention at
approximately 91 percent. After fine-tuning, benchmark results show modest but

Method: 提出LLaVA-NeuMT框架，包括层选择机制和神经元级适应策略，动态选择语言特定和无关神经元。

Result: 在M3-Multi30K和M3-AmbigCaps数据集上，LLaVA-NeuMT仅微调40%参数即超越全微调方法，达到SOTA结果。

Conclusion: LLaVA-NeuMT为多模态多语言翻译提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，并揭示了层和神经元选择的重要性。

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) enhances translation quality by
incorporating visual context, helping to resolve textual ambiguities. While
existing MMT methods perform well in bilingual settings, extending them to
multilingual translation remains challenging due to cross-lingual interference
and ineffective parameter-sharing strategies. To address this, we propose
LLaVA-NeuMT, a novel multimodal multilingual translation framework that
explicitly models language-specific and language-agnostic representations to
mitigate multilingual interference. Our approach consists of a layer selection
mechanism that identifies the most informative layers for different language
pairs and a neuron-level adaptation strategy that dynamically selects
language-specific and agnostic neurons to improve translation quality while
reducing redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments on the M3-Multi30K and
M3-AmbigCaps datasets, demonstrating that LLaVA-NeuMT, while fine-tuning only
40\% of the model parameters, surpasses full fine-tuning approaches and
ultimately achieves SOTA results on both datasets. Our analysis further
provides insights into the importance of selected layers and neurons in
multimodal multilingual adaptation, offering an efficient and scalable solution
to cross-lingual adaptation in multimodal translation.

original content and enhancing processing times considerably. The results
reveal marked improvements in operational efficiency, allowing legal
practitioners to direct their efforts toward critical analytical and
decision-making activities instead of manual reviews. This research highlights

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于比较对话动态相似性的度量方法，并验证其鲁棒性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法全面比较对话的整体交互动态，需要一种新方法来增强对话数据分析和评估对话代理。

Method: 设计了一种对话动态相似性度量，并开发了验证框架测试其鲁棒性和对话题的敏感性。

Result: 该方法成功应用于大型在线社区对话分析，揭示了情境权力在对话中的作用。

Conclusion: 新度量方法为对话动态分析提供了有效工具，有助于更全面地理解对话交互。

Abstract: The quality of a conversation goes beyond the individual quality of each
reply, and instead emerges from how these combine into interactional patterns
that give the conversation its distinctive overall "shape". However, there is
no robust automated method for comparing conversations in terms of their
overall interactional dynamics. Such methods could enhance the analysis of
conversational data and help evaluate conversational agents more holistically.
  In this work, we introduce a similarity measure for comparing conversations
with respect to their dynamics. We design a validation framework for testing
the robustness of the metric in capturing differences in conversation dynamics
and for assessing its sensitivity to the topic of the conversations. Finally,
to illustrate the measure's utility, we use it to analyze conversational
dynamics in a large online community, bringing new insights into the role of
situational power in conversations.

TL;DR: Multi-TAG框架通过多工具聚合增强LLM的数学推理能力，无需微调即可显著提升复杂问题的解决效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强方法在复杂多步数学推理问题上表现不佳，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: Multi-TAG框架允许LLM在每一步推理中同时调用多个工具，并聚合输出以验证和优化结果。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Multi-TAG平均提升6.0%至7.5%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Multi-TAG为复杂数学推理提供了一种高效、无需微调的方法，适用于多种LLM。

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools is a promising
avenue for developing high-performance mathematical reasoning systems. Prior
tool-augmented approaches typically finetune an LLM to select and invoke a
single tool at each reasoning step and show promising results on simpler math
reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K. However, these approaches struggle with
more complex math problems that require precise reasoning over multiple steps.
To address this limitation, in this work, we propose Multi-TAG, a Multi-Tool
AGgregation-based framework. Instead of relying on a single tool, Multi-TAG
guides an LLM to concurrently invoke multiple tools at each reasoning step. It
then aggregates their diverse outputs to verify and refine the reasoning
process, enhancing solution robustness and accuracy. Notably, Multi-TAG is a
finetuning-free, inference-only framework, making it readily applicable to any
LLM backbone, including large open-weight models which are computationally
expensive to finetune and proprietary frontier models which cannot be finetuned
with custom recipes. We evaluate Multi-TAG on four challenging benchmarks:
MATH500, AIME, AMC, and OlympiadBench. Across both open-weight and
closed-source LLM backbones, Multi-TAG consistently and substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 6.0%
to 7.5% over state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 现有方法在论点摘要生成阶段支持有限，缺乏事实修正和结构优化的能力。

Method: 结合灵活的掩码控制器和充分性检查模块，通过迭代的掩码和再生改进摘要。

Result: 在7/10的自动评估指标上超越现有方法，人类评估在覆盖性、忠实性和简洁性上显著提升。

Conclusion: Arg-LLaDA的迭代生成策略有效提升了论点摘要的质量。

Abstract: Argument summarization aims to generate concise, structured representations
of complex, multi-perspective debates. While recent work has advanced the
identification and clustering of argumentative components, the generation stage
remains underexplored. Existing approaches typically rely on single-pass
generation, offering limited support for factual correction or structural
refinement. To address this gap, we introduce Arg-LLaDA, a novel large language
diffusion framework that iteratively improves summaries via sufficiency-guided
remasking and regeneration. Our method combines a flexible masking controller
with a sufficiency-checking module to identify and revise unsupported,
redundant, or incomplete spans, yielding more faithful, concise, and coherent
outputs. Empirical results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that Arg-LLaDA
surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in 7 out of 10 automatic evaluation
metrics. In addition, human evaluations reveal substantial improvements across
core dimensions, coverage, faithfulness, and conciseness, validating the
effectiveness of our iterative, sufficiency-aware generation strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单LLM方法难以处理涉及多面证据的复杂声明验证，受现实世界事实核查实践的启发，需要更有效的方法。

Method: 采用辩论驱动方法，使用多个LLM代理（Debaters和Moderator）进行多轮辩论，并引入后训练策略优化Moderator。

Result: 实验表明，DebateCV在不同证据质量下优于现有声明验证方法。

Conclusion: 辩论驱动框架DebateCV有效解决了复杂声明验证问题，且代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Claim verification is critical for enhancing digital literacy. However, the
state-of-the-art single-LLM methods struggle with complex claim verification
that involves multi-faceted evidences. Inspired by real-world fact-checking
practices, we propose DebateCV, the first claim verification framework that
adopts a debate-driven methodology using multiple LLM agents. In our framework,
two Debaters take opposing stances on a claim and engage in multi-round
argumentation, while a Moderator evaluates the arguments and renders a verdict
with justifications. To further improve the performance of the Moderator, we
introduce a novel post-training strategy that leverages synthetic debate data
generated by the zero-shot DebateCV, effectively addressing the scarcity of
real-world debate-driven claim verification data. Experimental results show
that our method outperforms existing claim verification methods under varying
levels of evidence quality. Our code and dataset are publicly available at

Motivation: 现有主题质量评估方法（如连贯性和单词侵入）未衡量主题对语料库探索的促进作用，需设计基于任务和用户的评估方法。

Method: 通过用户研究了解用户如何解释主题，提出主题质量构建，并采用反思性主题分析从用户反馈中识别主题解释模式。

Result: 用户基于可用性和代表性启发式解释主题，而非概率，提出基于锚定-调整启发式的主题解释理论。

Conclusion: 主题解释可视为生态理性用户在不确定性下的判断，需开发认知偏差感知的用户模型和评估框架。

Abstract: Interpretation of topics is crucial for their downstream applications.
State-of-the-art evaluation measures of topic quality such as coherence and
word intrusion do not measure how much a topic facilitates the exploration of a
corpus. To design evaluation measures grounded on a task, and a population of
users, we do user studies to understand how users interpret topics. We propose
constructs of topic quality and ask users to assess them in the context of a
topic and provide rationale behind evaluations. We use reflexive thematic
analysis to identify themes of topic interpretations from rationales. Users
interpret topics based on availability and representativeness heuristics rather
than probability. We propose a theory of topic interpretation based on the
anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic: users anchor on salient words and make
semantic adjustments to arrive at an interpretation. Topic interpretation can
be viewed as making a judgment under uncertainty by an ecologically rational
user, and hence cognitive biases aware user models and evaluation frameworks
are needed.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在无性别提示下如何生成带有性别和职业偏见的回答，使用意大利语和两种流行LLM（ChatGPT和Gemini）进行实验，发现模型输出存在显著偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的广泛应用，其可能加剧社会偏见的问题引发担忧，特别是在非英语语言中的表现。

Method: 采用结构化实验方法，通过API收集3600条回答，分析模型对无性别提示的响应。

Result: 结果显示LLMs输出存在明显偏见，如Gemini将100%的“她”代词与“助理”而非“经理”关联。

Conclusion: 研究强调需开发缓解策略以减少AI偏见，未来可扩展至更多语言或模型。

Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a large variety of
domains has sparked worries about how easily they can perpetuate stereotypes
and contribute to the generation of biased content. With a focus on gender and
professional bias, this work examines in which manner LLMs shape responses to
ungendered prompts, contributing to biased outputs. This analysis uses a
structured experimental method, giving different prompts involving three
different professional job combinations, which are also characterized by a
hierarchical relationship. This study uses Italian, a language with extensive
grammatical gender differences, to highlight potential limitations in current
LLMs' ability to generate objective text in non-English languages. Two popular
LLM-based chatbots are examined, namely OpenAI ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini) and Google
Gemini (gemini-1.5-flash). Through APIs, we collected a range of 3600
responses. The results highlight how content generated by LLMs can perpetuate
stereotypes. For example, Gemini associated 100% (ChatGPT 97%) of 'she'
pronouns to the 'assistant' rather than the 'manager'. The presence of bias in
AI-generated text can have significant implications in many fields, such as in
the workplaces or in job selections, raising ethical concerns about its use.
Understanding these risks is pivotal to developing mitigation strategies and
assuring that AI-based systems do not increase social inequalities, but rather
contribute to more equitable outcomes. Future research directions include
expanding the study to additional chatbots or languages, refining prompt
engineering methods or further exploiting a larger experimental base.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）在数据中毒和方言差异（如AAVE与SAE）的共同作用下，会放大毒性输出，尤其是对AAVE输入的影响更显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨方言差异（AAVE与SAE）和数据中毒如何共同影响LLMs的毒性输出，揭示模型规模与偏见放大的关系。

Method: 使用不同规模的LLaMA模型，通过数据中毒实验和GPT-4o作为公平性审计工具，分析毒性输出的差异。

Result: 数据中毒显著增加AAVE输入的毒性，而对SAE影响较小；模型规模越大，偏见放大效应越明显。

Conclusion: 需开发方言感知的评估方法、针对性去偏见干预措施，并在模型训练中注重社会责任。

Abstract: Despite the ongoing improvements in the design of large language models
(LLMs) to foster inclusion and balanced responses, these systems remain
susceptible to encoding and amplifying social biases. This study examines how
dialectal variation, specifically African American Vernacular English (AAVE)
versus Standard American English (SAE), interacts with data poisoning to
influence toxicity in outputs. Using both small- and medium-scale LLaMA models,
we show that even minimal exposure to poisoned data significantly increases
toxicity for AAVE inputs, while it remains comparatively unaffected for SAE.
Larger models exhibit a more significant amplification effect which suggests
heightened susceptibility with scale. To further assess these disparities, we
employed GPT-4o as a fairness auditor, which identified harmful stereotypical
patterns disproportionately tied to AAVE inputs, including portrayals of
aggression, criminality, and intellectual inferiority. These findings
underscore the compounding impact of data poisoning and dialectal bias and
emphasize the need for dialect-aware evaluation, targeted debiasing
interventions, and socially responsible training protocols during development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法同时保证可重复性、透明性和高效性，且LLM的高估程度未量化。

Method: 提出ArxivRoll框架，包含SCP（自动生成私有测试案例）和Rugged Scores（量化污染与偏差）。

Result: 实验证明基准质量高，并对当前LLM进行了系统评估。

Conclusion: ArxivRoll有效解决了LLM评估中的高估问题，提供了动态、透明的评估方法。

Abstract: Overestimation in evaluating large language models (LLMs) has become an
increasing concern. Due to the contamination of public benchmarks or imbalanced
model training, LLMs may achieve unreal evaluation results on public
benchmarks, either intentionally or unintentionally, which leads to unfair
comparisons among LLMs and undermines their realistic capability assessments.
Existing benchmarks attempt to address these issues by keeping test cases
permanently secret, mitigating contamination through human evaluation, or
repeatedly collecting and constructing new samples. However, these approaches
fail to ensure reproducibility, transparency, and high efficiency
simultaneously. Moreover, the extent of overestimation in current LLMs remains
unquantified. To address these issues, we propose ArxivRoll, a dynamic
evaluation framework inspired by one-time pad encryption in cryptography.
ArxivRoll comprises two key components: \emph{i) SCP (Sequencing, Cloze, and
Prediction)}, an automated generator for private test cases, and \emph{ii)
Rugged Scores (RS)}, metrics that measure the proportion of public benchmark
contamination and training bias. Leveraging SCP, ArxivRoll constructs a new
benchmark every six months using recent articles from ArXiv and employs them
for one-time evaluations of LLM performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the high quality of our benchmark, and we provide a systematic evaluation of
current LLMs. The source code is available at

Result: PAD攻击成功率高达97%，LLDMs生成有害内容的速度是LLMs的两倍。

Conclusion: LLDMs存在显著安全风险，需进一步研究其架构以确保安全部署。

Abstract: Large Language Diffusion Models (LLDMs) exhibit comparable performance to
LLMs while offering distinct advantages in inference speed and mathematical
reasoning tasks.The precise and rapid generation capabilities of LLDMs amplify
concerns of harmful generations, while existing jailbreak methodologies
designed for Large Language Models (LLMs) prove limited effectiveness against
LLDMs and fail to expose safety vulnerabilities.Successful defense cannot
definitively resolve harmful generation concerns, as it remains unclear whether
LLDMs possess safety robustness or existing attacks are incompatible with
diffusion-based architectures.To address this, we first reveal the
vulnerability of LLDMs to jailbreak and demonstrate that attack failure in
LLDMs stems from fundamental architectural differences.We present a PArallel
Decoding jailbreak (PAD) for diffusion-based language models. PAD introduces
Multi-Point Attention Attack, which guides parallel generative processes toward
harmful outputs that inspired by affirmative response patterns in LLMs.
Experimental evaluations across four LLDMs demonstrate that PAD achieves
jailbreak attack success rates by 97%, revealing significant safety
vulnerabilities. Furthermore, compared to autoregressive LLMs of the same size,
LLDMs increase the harmful generation speed by 2x, significantly highlighting
risks of uncontrolled misuse.Through comprehensive analysis, we provide an
investigation into LLDM architecture, offering critical insights for the secure
deployment of diffusion-based language models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在社会科学领域的应用潜力，特别是其对复杂且争议性概念（如民粹主义）的理解能力。

Method: 通过构建专门的数据集，评估多种预训练和指令调优的LLMs，并与微调的RoBERTa模型进行对比。

Result: 微调的RoBERTa模型显著优于指令调优的LLMs，但后者在跨领域数据上表现更稳健。

Conclusion: LLMs在社会科学任务中仍有局限性，但微调和跨领域适应性为其提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of instruction-following tasks, yet their grasp of nuanced social
science concepts remains underexplored. This paper examines whether LLMs can
identify and classify fine-grained forms of populism, a complex and contested
concept in both academic and media debates. To this end, we curate and release
novel datasets specifically designed to capture populist discourse. We evaluate
a range of pre-trained (large) language models, both open-weight and
proprietary, across multiple prompting paradigms. Our analysis reveals notable
variation in performance, highlighting the limitations of LLMs in detecting
populist discourse. We find that a fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier vastly
outperforms all new-era instruction-tuned LLMs, unless fine-tuned.
Additionally, we apply our best-performing model to analyze campaign speeches
by Donald Trump, extracting valuable insights into his strategic use of
populist rhetoric. Finally, we assess the generalizability of these models by
benchmarking them on campaign speeches by European politicians, offering a lens
into cross-context transferability in political discourse analysis. In this
setting, we find that instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit greater robustness on
out-of-domain data.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，AutoPCR在提及级和文档级评估中均表现最佳且鲁棒性最强。

Conclusion: AutoPCR具有归纳能力和对新本体的泛化能力，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Phenotype concept recognition (CR) is a fundamental task in biomedical text
mining, enabling applications such as clinical diagnostics and knowledge graph
construction. However, existing methods often require ontology-specific
training and struggle to generalize across diverse text types and evolving
biomedical terminology. We present AutoPCR, a prompt-based phenotype CR method
that does not require ontology-specific training. AutoPCR performs CR in three
stages: entity extraction using a hybrid of rule-based and neural tagging
strategies, candidate retrieval via SapBERT, and entity linking through
prompting a large language model. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show
that AutoPCR achieves the best average and most robust performance across both
mention-level and document-level evaluations, surpassing prior state-of-the-art
methods. Further ablation and transfer studies demonstrate its inductive
capability and generalizability to new ontologies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Smooth Reading的分块推理方法，显著缩小了Recurrent LLMs与Self-Attention LLMs在长上下文任务中的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recurrent LLMs在长上下文任务中表现不佳，因其固定大小的内存限制。现有方法未能使其性能与Self-Attention LLMs匹敌。

Method: 提出Smooth Reading，一种分块处理上下文并迭代汇总信息的方法，降低内存需求。

Result: 实验显示，该方法将Recurrent LLMs的性能提升至优于Self-Attention LLMs（3.61%），同时保持高效性（训练快3倍，推理快2倍）。

Conclusion: Smooth Reading首次使Recurrent LLMs在长上下文任务中性能与Self-Attention LLMs相当，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recently, recurrent large language models (Recurrent LLMs) with linear
computational complexity have re-emerged as efficient alternatives to
self-attention-based LLMs (Self-Attention LLMs), which have quadratic
complexity. However, Recurrent LLMs often underperform on long-context tasks
due to their limited fixed-size memory. Previous research has primarily focused
on enhancing the memory capacity of Recurrent LLMs through architectural
innovations, but these approaches have not yet enabled Recurrent LLMs to match
the performance of Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We argue that
this limitation arises because processing the entire context at once is not
well-suited for Recurrent LLMs. In this paper, we propose Smooth Reading, a
chunk-wise inference method inspired by human reading strategies. Smooth
Reading processes context in chunks and iteratively summarizes the contextual
information, thereby reducing memory demands and making the approach more
compatible with Recurrent LLMs. Our experimental results show that this method
substantially narrows the performance gap between Recurrent and Self-Attention
LLMs on long-context tasks, while preserving the efficiency advantages of
Recurrent LLMs. Our Smooth Reading boosts SWA-3B-4k (a Recurrent LLM) from
5.68% lower to 3.61% higher performance than Self-Attention LLMs on LongBench.
Besides, our method maintains the high efficiency, training 3x faster and
inferring 2x faster at 64k context compared to Self-Attention LLMs. To our
knowledge, this is the first work to achieve comparable performance using
Recurrent LLMs compared with Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We hope
our method will inspire future research in this area. To facilitate further
progress, we will release code and dataset.

Method: 提出基于预训练ASR和SD模型的时间戳对齐流程，结合RoBERTa和Wav2Vec的嵌入，使用交叉注意力融合和门控机制。

Result: 在IEMOCAP数据集上，时间戳对齐显著提升SER准确性，优于未同步的基线方法。

Conclusion: 时间戳对齐对提升多模态情感识别准确性至关重要，为稳健的情感分析提供了基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of incorporating timestamp-based
alignment between Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts and Speaker
Diarization (SD) outputs on Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) accuracy.
Misalignment between these two modalities often reduces the reliability of
multimodal emotion recognition systems, particularly in conversational
contexts. To address this issue, we introduce an alignment pipeline utilizing
pre-trained ASR and speaker diarization models, systematically synchronizing
timestamps to generate accurately labeled speaker segments. Our multimodal
approach combines textual embeddings extracted via RoBERTa with audio
embeddings from Wav2Vec, leveraging cross-attention fusion enhanced by a gating
mechanism. Experimental evaluations on the IEMOCAP benchmark dataset
demonstrate that precise timestamp alignment improves SER accuracy,
outperforming baseline methods that lack synchronization. The results highlight
the critical importance of temporal alignment, demonstrating its effectiveness
in enhancing overall emotion recognition accuracy and providing a foundation
for robust multimodal emotion analysis.

Conclusion: SIQ首次将认知原则与语音基准结合，揭示了多模态训练中被忽视的挑战。

Abstract: We introduce Speech-based Intelligence Quotient (SIQ) as a new form of human
cognition-inspired evaluation pipeline for voice understanding large language
models, LLM Voice, designed to assess their voice understanding ability. Moving
beyond popular voice understanding metrics such as word error rate (WER), SIQ
examines LLM Voice across three cognitive levels motivated by Bloom's Taxonomy:
(1) Remembering (i.e., WER for verbatim accuracy); (2) Understanding (i.e.,
similarity of LLM's interpretations); and (3) Application (i.e., QA accuracy
for simulating downstream tasks). We demonstrate that SIQ not only quantifies
voice understanding abilities but also provides unified comparisons between
cascaded methods (e.g., ASR LLM) and end-to-end models, identifies annotation
errors in existing benchmarks, and detects hallucinations in LLM Voice. Our
framework represents a first-of-its-kind intelligence examination that bridges
cognitive principles with voice-oriented benchmarks, while exposing overlooked
challenges in multi-modal training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自动生成带有语法错误和不流畅性的音频-文本对的方法，并设计了一系列客观指标来评估生成的数据，以选择更适合口语语法纠错（SGEC）的数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语法纠错（GEC）基准数据集较为完善，但高质量的口语语法纠错（SGEC）标注数据集仍然不足。

Method: 提出了一种全自动方法，生成带有语法错误和不流畅性的音频-文本对，并设计了一系列客观指标来评估生成的数据。

Result: 实验在首个公开的带有语法错误标注的语音数据集S&I Corpus上进行，评估了增强语料库在书面GEC和SGEC中的应用。

Conclusion: 目标是生成一个增强的数据集，既能保持原始数据的文本和声学特性，又能提供新的错误类型，同时不改变第二语言学习者的语言评估分数。

Abstract: While there exist strong benchmark datasets for grammatical error correction
(GEC), high-quality annotated spoken datasets for Spoken GEC (SGEC) are still
under-resourced. In this paper, we propose a fully automated method to generate
audio-text pairs with grammatical errors and disfluencies. Moreover, we propose
a series of objective metrics that can be used to evaluate the generated data
and choose the more suitable dataset for SGEC. The goal is to generate an
augmented dataset that maintains the textual and acoustic characteristics of
the original data while providing new types of errors. This augmented dataset
should augment and enrich the original corpus without altering the language
assessment scores of the second language (L2) learners. We evaluate the use of
the augmented corpus both for written GEC (the text part) and for SGEC (the
audio-text pairs). Our experiments are conducted on the S\&I Corpus, the first
publicly available speech dataset with grammar error annotations.

TL;DR: 研究通过多种Transformer模型和临床场景，为荷兰临床文本中的药物不良事件（ADE）检测设定了基准，MedRoBERTa.nl表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为荷兰临床自由文本中的ADE检测建立基准，评估不同模型在命名实体识别（NER）和关系分类（RC）任务中的表现。

Method: 使用Bi-LSTM和四种Transformer模型（BERTje、RobBERT、MedRoBERTa.nl、NuNER）在102份荷兰ICU临床记录上进行训练，并通过内部和外部验证评估性能。

Result: MedRoBERTa.nl在ADE RC任务中表现最佳，宏平均F1得分为0.63（黄金标准）和0.62（预测实体），外部验证召回率为0.67至0.74。

Conclusion: 研究为临床自由文本中的ADE检测提供了稳健且临床意义显著的评估方法，强调了使用适合任务的性能指标的重要性。

Abstract: In this study, we set a benchmark for adverse drug event (ADE) detection in
Dutch clinical free text documents using several transformer models, clinical
scenarios and fit-for-purpose performance measures. We trained a Bidirectional
Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model and four transformer-based Dutch and/or
multilingual encoder models (BERTje, RobBERT, MedRoBERTa.nl, and NuNER) for the
tasks of named entity recognition (NER) and relation classification (RC) using
102 richly annotated Dutch ICU clinical progress notes. Anonymized free text
clinical progress notes of patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of
one academic hospital and discharge letters of patients admitted to Internal
Medicine wards of two non-academic hospitals were reused. We evaluated our ADE
RC models internally using gold standard (two-step task) and predicted entities
(end-to-end task). In addition, all models were externally validated on
detecting ADEs at the document level. We report both micro- and macro-averaged
F1 scores, given the imbalance of ADEs in the datasets. Although differences
for the ADE RC task between the models were small, MedRoBERTa.nl was the best
performing model with macro-averaged F1 score of 0.63 using gold standard and
0.62 using predicted entities. The MedRoBERTa.nl models also performed the best
in our external validation and achieved recall of between 0.67 to 0.74 using
predicted entities, meaning between 67 to 74% of discharge letters with ADEs
were detected. Our benchmark study presents a robust and clinically meaningful
approach for evaluating language models for ADE detection in clinical free text
documents. Our study highlights the need to use appropriate performance
measures fit for the task of ADE detection in clinical free-text documents and
envisioned future clinical use.

Motivation: 现有医疗文本嵌入模型存在数据覆盖不足和方法过时的问题，且评估标准无法适应实际医疗任务的多样性。

Method: 利用MEDTE模型，通过自监督对比学习在多样化医疗语料库上进行微调，并设计了一个包含51项任务的医疗文本评估基准。

Result: 该方法不仅建立了稳健的评估框架，还在多项任务中优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 结合MEDTE模型和定制化评估基准，能够显著提升医疗文本嵌入的性能和适用性。

Abstract: Medical text embedding models are foundational to a wide array of healthcare
applications, ranging from clinical decision support and biomedical information
retrieval to medical question answering, yet they remain hampered by two
critical shortcomings. First, most models are trained on a narrow slice of
medical and biological data, beside not being up to date in terms of
methodology, making them ill suited to capture the diversity of terminology and
semantics encountered in practice. Second, existing evaluations are often
inadequate: even widely used benchmarks fail to generalize across the full
spectrum of real world medical tasks.
  To address these gaps, we leverage MEDTE, a GTE model extensively fine-tuned
on diverse medical corpora through self-supervised contrastive learning across
multiple data sources, to deliver robust medical text embeddings.
  Alongside this model, we propose a comprehensive benchmark suite of 51 tasks
spanning classification, clustering, pair classification, and retrieval modeled
on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) but tailored to the nuances of
medical text. Our results demonstrate that this combined approach not only
establishes a robust evaluation framework but also yields embeddings that
consistently outperform state of the art alternatives in different tasks.

TL;DR: GEPA是一种基于自然语言反思的提示优化器，通过少量样本即可显著提升LLM性能，优于GRPO和MIPROv2。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL方法（如GRPO）需要大量样本训练LLM，而语言的解释性可能提供更丰富的学习媒介。

Method: GEPA通过自然语言反思诊断问题、提出提示更新，并结合Pareto前沿的互补经验。

Result: GEPA在四个任务中平均优于GRPO 10%，最多20%，且样本需求减少35倍；也优于MIPROv2 10%。

Conclusion: GEPA展示了在少量样本下高效优化LLM的潜力，适用于推理时代码优化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks via
reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), which often require thousands of rollouts to learn new tasks. We argue
that the interpretable nature of language can often provide a much richer
learning medium for LLMs, compared with policy gradients derived from sparse,
scalar rewards. To test this, we introduce GEPA (Genetic-Pareto), a prompt
optimizer that thoroughly incorporates natural language reflection to learn
high-level rules from trial and error. Given any AI system containing one or
more LLM prompts, GEPA samples system-level trajectories (e.g., reasoning, tool
calls, and tool outputs) and reflects on them in natural language to diagnose
problems, propose and test prompt updates, and combine complementary lessons
from the Pareto frontier of its own attempts. As a result of GEPA's design, it
can often turn even just a few rollouts into a large quality gain. Across four
tasks, GEPA outperforms GRPO by 10% on average and by up to 20%, while using up
to 35x fewer rollouts. GEPA also outperforms the leading prompt optimizer,
MIPROv2, by over 10% across two LLMs, and demonstrates promising results as an
inference-time search strategy for code optimization.

Result: 框架在显著减少参数的情况下实现了接近最优的F1分数。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在参数效率和性能之间取得了平衡，适用于多分布场景。

Abstract: Lane detection models are often evaluated in a closed-world setting, where
training and testing occur on the same dataset. We observe that, even within
the same domain, cross-dataset distribution shifts can cause severe
catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. To address this, we first train a
base model on a source distribution and then adapt it to each new target
distribution by creating separate branches, fine-tuning only selected
components while keeping the original source branch fixed. Based on a
component-wise analysis, we identify effective fine-tuning strategies for
target distributions that enable parameter-efficient adaptation. At inference
time, we propose using a supervised contrastive learning model to identify the
input distribution and dynamically route it to the corresponding branch. Our
framework achieves near-optimal F1-scores while using significantly fewer
parameters than training separate models for each distribution.

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性和准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为人体网格语义分割提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud deep learning have led to models that achieve
high per-part labeling accuracy on large-scale point clouds, using only the raw
geometry of unordered point sets. In parallel, the field of human parsing
focuses on predicting body part and clothing/accessory labels from images. This
work aims to bridge these two domains by enabling per-vertex semantic
segmentation of large-scale human meshes. To achieve this, a pseudo-ground
truth labeling pipeline is developed for the Thuman2.1 dataset: meshes are
first aligned to a canonical pose, segmented from multiple viewpoints, and the
resulting point-level labels are then backprojected onto the original mesh to
produce per-point pseudo ground truth annotations. Subsequently, a novel,
memory-efficient sampling strategy is introduced, a windowed iterative farthest
point sampling (FPS) with space-filling curve-based serialization to
effectively downsample the point clouds. This is followed by a purely geometric
segmentation using PointTransformer, enabling semantic parsing of human meshes
without relying on texture information. Experimental results confirm the
effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ADAS依赖昂贵传感器，而基于机器学习的ADAS（ML-ADAS）使用低成本摄像头，但其物体检测系统存在安全漏洞。

Method: 提出ShrinkBox攻击方法，通过缩小训练数据中的边界框来干扰物体检测和距离估计，攻击成功率高且隐蔽。

Result: 在YOLOv9m上实现了96%的攻击成功率，仅需4%的数据污染，且显著增加距离估计的误差。

Conclusion: ShrinkBox攻击揭示了ML-ADAS的安全隐患，需进一步研究防御措施。

Abstract: Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) significantly enhance road safety
by detecting potential collisions and alerting drivers. However, their reliance
on expensive sensor technologies such as LiDAR and radar limits accessibility,
particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Machine learning-based ADAS
(ML-ADAS), leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs) with only standard camera
input, offers a cost-effective alternative. Critical to ML-ADAS is the
collision avoidance feature, which requires the ability to detect objects and
estimate their distances accurately. This is achieved with specialized DNNs
like YOLO, which provides real-time object detection, and a lightweight,
detection-wise distance estimation approach that relies on key features
extracted from the detections like bounding box dimensions and size. However,
the robustness of these systems is undermined by security vulnerabilities in
object detectors. In this paper, we introduce ShrinkBox, a novel backdoor
attack targeting object detection in collision avoidance ML-ADAS. Unlike
existing attacks that manipulate object class labels or presence, ShrinkBox
subtly shrinks ground truth bounding boxes. This attack remains undetected in
dataset inspections and standard benchmarks while severely disrupting
downstream distance estimation. We demonstrate that ShrinkBox can be realized
in the YOLOv9m object detector at an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96%, with
only a 4% poisoning ratio in the training instances of the KITTI dataset.
Furthermore, given the low error targets introduced in our relaxed poisoning
strategy, we find that ShrinkBox increases the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in
downstream distance estimation by more than 3x on poisoned samples, potentially
resulting in delays or prevention of collision warnings altogether.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统集中式学习存在隐私风险，而分散式方法如联邦学习和群体学习在处理异构数据时效率低下且易受灾难性遗忘影响。

Method: VGS-ATD是一种新型分布式学习框架，通过实验验证其在30个数据集和80个独立标签上的表现。

Result: VGS-ATD在准确率（92.7%）、可扩展性（仅1%准确率下降）和计算效率（成本降低50%）上均优于集中式和群体学习。

Conclusion: VGS-ATD在隐私保护、效率和可扩展性方面表现出色，适用于动态复杂的临床环境。

Abstract: In recent years, advanced deep learning architectures have shown strong
performance in medical imaging tasks. However, the traditional centralized
learning paradigm poses serious privacy risks as all data is collected and
trained on a single server. To mitigate this challenge, decentralized
approaches such as federated learning and swarm learning have emerged, allowing
model training on local nodes while sharing only model weights. While these
methods enhance privacy, they struggle with heterogeneous and imbalanced data
and suffer from inefficiencies due to frequent communication and the
aggregation of weights. More critically, the dynamic and complex nature of
clinical environments demands scalable AI systems capable of continuously
learning from diverse modalities and multilabels. Yet, both centralized and
decentralized models are prone to catastrophic forgetting during system
expansion, often requiring full model retraining to incorporate new data. To
address these limitations, we propose VGS-ATD, a novel distributed learning
framework. To validate VGS-ATD, we evaluate it in experiments spanning 30
datasets and 80 independent labels across distributed nodes, VGS-ATD achieved
an overall accuracy of 92.7%, outperforming centralized learning (84.9%) and
swarm learning (72.99%), while federated learning failed under these conditions
due to high requirements on computational resources. VGS-ATD also demonstrated
strong scalability, with only a 1% drop in accuracy on existing nodes after
expansion, compared to a 20% drop in centralized learning, highlighting its
resilience to catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, it reduced computational
costs by up to 50% relative to both centralized and swarm learning, confirming
its superior efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Computer vision applications are omnipresent nowadays. The current paper
explores the use of fuzzy logic in computer vision, stressing its role in
handling uncertainty, noise, and imprecision in image data. Fuzzy logic is able
to model gradual transitions and human-like reasoning and provides a promising
approach to computer vision. Fuzzy approaches offer a way to improve object

discuss key fuzzy techniques, including fuzzy clustering, fuzzy inference
systems, type-2 fuzzy sets, and fuzzy rule-based decision-making. The paper
also discusses various applications, including medical imaging, autonomous
systems, and industrial inspection. Additionally, we explore the integration of
fuzzy logic with deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) to enhance performance in complex vision tasks. Finally, we examine
emerging trends such as hybrid fuzzy-deep learning models and explainable AI.

Abstract: Next Location Prediction is a fundamental task in the study of human
mobility, with wide-ranging applications in transportation planning, urban
governance, and epidemic forecasting. In practice, when humans attempt to
predict the next location in a trajectory, they often visualize the trajectory
on a map and reason based on road connectivity and movement trends. However,
the vast majority of existing next-location prediction models do not reason
over maps \textbf{in the way that humans do}. Fortunately, the recent
development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has demonstrated strong
capabilities in visual perception and even visual reasoning. This opens up a
new possibility: by rendering both the road network and trajectory onto an
image and leveraging the reasoning abilities of VLMs, we can enable models to
perform trajectory inference in a human-like manner. To explore this idea, we
first propose a method called Vision-Guided Location Search (VGLS), which
evaluates whether a general-purpose VLM is capable of trajectory-based
reasoning without modifying any of its internal parameters. Based on insights
from the VGLS results, we further propose our main approach: VLMLocPredictor,
which is composed of two stages: In the first stage, we design two Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) tasks that help the VLM understand road network and
trajectory structures and acquire basic reasoning ability on such visual
inputs. In the second stage, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Visual
Map Feedback, enabling the model to self-improve its next-location prediction
ability through interaction with the environment. Experiments conducted on
datasets from four different cities show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits superior cross-city
generalization compared to other LLM-based approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态AI方法以提升嫌疑人素描的自动化水平和质量。

Method: 开发并评估了三种模型：基础Stable Diffusion模型、结合CLIP的模型，以及引入LoRA微调CLIP的新方法。

Result: 基础模型在结构相似性（SSIM）和信噪比（PSNR）上表现最佳，新模型在感知相似性（LPIPS）上有所提升。

Conclusion: 基础模型在素描清晰度和质量上表现最优，尽管新方法在部分指标上有改进。

Abstract: This project investigates the use of multimodal AI-driven approaches to
automate and enhance suspect sketching. Three pipelines were developed and
evaluated: (1) baseline image-to-image Stable Diffusion model, (2) same model
integrated with a pre-trained CLIP model for text-image alignment, and (3)
novel approach incorporating LoRA fine-tuning of the CLIP model, applied to
self-attention and cross-attention layers, and integrated with Stable
Diffusion. An ablation study confirmed that fine-tuning both self- and
cross-attention layers yielded the best alignment between text descriptions and
sketches. Performance testing revealed that Model 1 achieved the highest
structural similarity (SSIM) of 0.72 and a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of
25 dB, outperforming Model 2 and Model 3. Iterative refinement enhanced
perceptual similarity (LPIPS), with Model 3 showing improvement over Model 2
but still trailing Model 1. Qualitatively, sketches generated by Model 1
demonstrated the clearest facial features, highlighting its robustness as a
baseline despite its simplicity.

Result: CLIP在视觉线索被遮挡时表现不稳定，但通过添加类别特定噪声可提高分类准确性和模型置信度。

Conclusion: 论文讨论了CLIP在临床领域的应用挑战，并提出了未来改进方向以提升跨领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Human action recognition plays a critical role in healthcare and medicine,
supporting applications such as patient behavior monitoring, fall detection,
surgical robot supervision, and procedural skill assessment. While traditional
models like CNNs and RNNs have achieved moderate success, they often struggle
to generalize across diverse and complex actions. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, especially the transformer-based CLIP model, offer
promising capabilities for generalizing action recognition from video data. In
this work, we evaluate CLIP on the UCF-101 dataset and systematically analyze
its performance under three masking strategies: (1) percentage-based and
shape-based black masking at 10%, 30%, and 50%, (2) feature-specific masking to
suppress bias-inducing elements, and (3) isolation masking that retains only
class-specific regions. Our results reveal that CLIP exhibits inconsistent
behavior and frequent misclassifications, particularly when essential visual
cues are obscured. To overcome these limitations, we propose incorporating
class-specific noise, learned via a custom loss function, to reinforce
attention to class-defining features. This enhancement improves classification
accuracy and model confidence while reducing bias. We conclude with a
discussion on the challenges of applying such models in clinical domains and
outline directions for future work to improve generalizability across
domain-independent healthcare scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无负载心脏几何形状对个性化生物力学建模至关重要，但传统方法计算成本高且复杂。

Method: 采用图注意力架构和循环一致性策略，结合生理参数，实现双向预测和部分自监督学习。

Result: 在20,700次有限元模拟中，HeartUnloadNet达到亚毫米精度，推理时间仅为0.02秒，比传统方法快10^5倍。

Conclusion: HeartUnloadNet为传统逆向有限元求解器提供了可扩展且准确的替代方案，支持未来实时临床应用。

Abstract: The unloaded cardiac geometry (i.e., the state of the heart devoid of luminal
pressure) serves as a valuable zero-stress and zero-strain reference and is
critical for personalized biomechanical modeling of cardiac function, to
understand both healthy and diseased physiology and to predict the effects of
cardiac interventions. However, estimating the unloaded geometry from clinical
images remains a challenging task. Traditional approaches rely on inverse
finite element (FE) solvers that require iterative optimization and are
computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce HeartUnloadNet, a deep
learning framework that predicts the unloaded left ventricular (LV) shape
directly from the end diastolic (ED) mesh while explicitly incorporating
biophysical priors. The network accepts a mesh of arbitrary size along with
physiological parameters such as ED pressure, myocardial stiffness scale, and
fiber helix orientation, and outputs the corresponding unloaded mesh. It adopts
a graph attention architecture and employs a cycle-consistency strategy to
enable bidirectional (loading and unloading) prediction, allowing for partial
self-supervision that improves accuracy and reduces the need for large training
datasets. Trained and tested on 20,700 FE simulations across diverse LV
geometries and physiological conditions, HeartUnloadNet achieves sub-millimeter
accuracy, with an average DSC of 0.986 and HD of 0.083 cm, while reducing
inference time to just 0.02 seconds per case, over 10^5 times faster and
significantly more accurate than traditional inverse FE solvers. Ablation
studies confirm the effectiveness of the architecture. Notably, the
cycle-consistent design enables the model to maintain a DSC of 97% even with as
few as 200 training samples. This work thus presents a scalable and accurate
surrogate for inverse FE solvers, supporting real-time clinical applications in
the future.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence is emerging as a transformative frontier in AI, yet it
remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets. Unlike the
abundant 2D imagery, acquiring 3D data typically requires specialized sensors
and laborious annotation. In this work, we present a scalable pipeline that
converts single-view images into comprehensive, scale- and appearance-realistic
3D representations - including point clouds, camera poses, depth maps, and
pseudo-RGBD - via integrated depth estimation, camera calibration, and scale
calibration. Our method bridges the gap between the vast repository of imagery
and the increasing demand for spatial scene understanding. By automatically
generating authentic, scale-aware 3D data from images, we significantly reduce
data collection costs and open new avenues for advancing spatial intelligence.
We release two generated spatial datasets, i.e., COCO-3D and Objects365-v2-3D,
and demonstrate through extensive experiments that our generated data can
benefit various 3D tasks, ranging from fundamental perception to MLLM-based
reasoning. These results validate our pipeline as an effective solution for
developing AI systems capable of perceiving, understanding, and interacting
with physical environments.

Motivation: 解决现有NeRF和3DGS方法在训练和渲染速度、传感器兼容性及通用性方面的不足。

Method: 使用稀疏3D体素基元表示体积，每个体素为局部隐式场，支持自适应修剪和密集化。

Result: SaLF训练快（<30分钟），渲染高效（相机50+ FPS，LiDAR 600+ FPS），支持非针孔相机和旋转LiDAR。

Conclusion: SaLF在保持真实感的同时，提升了效率和功能，适用于大规模自动驾驶传感器模拟。

Abstract: High-fidelity sensor simulation of light-based sensors such as cameras and
LiDARs is critical for safe and accurate autonomy testing. Neural radiance
field (NeRF)-based methods that reconstruct sensor observations via ray-casting
of implicit representations have demonstrated accurate simulation of driving
scenes, but are slow to train and render, hampering scale. 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated faster training and rendering times through
rasterization, but is primarily restricted to pinhole camera sensors,
preventing usage for realistic multi-sensor autonomy evaluation. Moreover, both
NeRF and 3DGS couple the representation with the rendering procedure (implicit
networks for ray-based evaluation, particles for rasterization), preventing
interoperability, which is key for general usage. In this work, we present
Sparse Local Fields (SaLF), a novel volumetric representation that supports
rasterization and raytracing. SaLF represents volumes as a sparse set of 3D
voxel primitives, where each voxel is a local implicit field. SaLF has fast
training (<30 min) and rendering capabilities (50+ FPS for camera and 600+ FPS
LiDAR), has adaptive pruning and densification to easily handle large scenes,
and can support non-pinhole cameras and spinning LiDARs. We demonstrate that
SaLF has similar realism as existing self-driving sensor simulation methods
while improving efficiency and enhancing capabilities, enabling more scalable
simulation. https://waabi.ai/salf/

Abstract: Optical Music Recognition (OMR) for historical Chinese musical notations,
such as suzipu and l\"ul\"upu, presents unique challenges due to high class
imbalance and limited training data. This paper introduces significant
advancements in OMR for Jiang Kui's influential collection Baishidaoren Gequ
from 1202. In this work, we develop and evaluate a character recognition model
for scarce imbalanced data. We improve upon previous baselines by reducing the
Character Error Rate (CER) from 10.4% to 7.1% for suzipu, despite working with
77 highly imbalanced classes, and achieve a remarkable CER of 0.9% for
l\"ul\"upu. Our models outperform human transcribers, with an average human CER
of 15.9% and a best-case CER of 7.6%. We employ temperature scaling to achieve
a well-calibrated model with an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) below 0.0162.
Using a leave-one-edition-out cross-validation approach, we ensure robust
performance across five historical editions. Additionally, we extend the
KuiSCIMA dataset to include all 109 pieces from Baishidaoren Gequ, encompassing
suzipu, l\"ul\"upu, and jianzipu notations. Our findings advance the
digitization and accessibility of historical Chinese music, promoting cultural
diversity in OMR and expanding its applicability to underrepresented music

Conclusion: SAR-Text和SAR-Narrator为SAR图像的语义理解提供了有效工具，并展示了在视觉语言任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in the
field of remote sensing in recent years. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery, with its all-weather capability, is essential in remote sensing, yet
the lack of large-scale, high-quality SAR image-text datasets hinders its
semantic understanding. In this paper, we construct SAR-Text, a large-scale and
high-quality dataset consisting of over 130,000 SAR image-text pairs. To
construct the SAR-Text dataset, we design the SAR-Narrator framework, which
generates textual descriptions for SAR images through a multi-stage progressive
transfer learning strategy. To verify the effectiveness of the SAR-TEXT
dataset, we conduct experiments on three typical vision-language tasks:
image-text retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA).
Specifically, we construct three representative models on SAR-TEXT:
SAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT. SAR-RS-CLIP achieves notable
improvements in retrieval performance, boosting average recall by 16.43% and
10.54% on the OSdataset-512 and HRSID test sets, respectively. In the
captioning task, SAR-RS-CoCa achieves BLEU-4, SPICE, and CIDEr scores exceeding
those of the original CoCa model by more than 8x, 4x, and 10x, respectively. In
the VQA task, SAR-GPT outperforms baseline and single-stage models on multiple
SAR-VQA datasets, demonstrating stronger semantic understanding and reasoning
ability, as further confirmed by qualitative results. It is worth noting that,
as a flexible captioning tool, SAR-Narrator can be readily adopted by the
community to construct larger-scale SAR image-text datasets.

Abstract: Modeling animatable human avatars from videos is a long-standing and
challenging problem. While conventional methods require per-instance
optimization, recent feed-forward methods have been proposed to generate 3D
Gaussians with a learnable network. However, these methods predict Gaussians
for each frame independently, without fully capturing the relations of
Gaussians from different timestamps. To address this, we propose Human Gaussian
Graph to model the connection between predicted Gaussians and human SMPL mesh,
so that we can leverage information from all frames to recover an animatable
human representation. Specifically, the Human Gaussian Graph contains dual
layers where Gaussians are the first layer nodes and mesh vertices serve as the
second layer nodes. Based on this structure, we further propose the intra-node
operation to aggregate various Gaussians connected to one mesh vertex, and
inter-node operation to support message passing among mesh node neighbors.
Experimental results on novel view synthesis and novel pose animation
demonstrate the efficiency and generalization of our method.

Abstract: Drivable Free-space prediction is a fundamental and crucial problem in
autonomous driving. Recent works have addressed the problem by representing the
entire non-obstacle road regions as the free-space. In contrast our aim is to
estimate the driving corridors that are a navigable subset of the entire road
region. Unfortunately, existing corridor estimation methods directly assume a
BEV-centric representation, which is hard to obtain. In contrast, we frame
drivable free-space corridor prediction as a pure image perception task, using
only monocular camera input. However such a formulation poses several
challenges as one doesn't have the corresponding data for such free-space
corridor segments in the image. Consequently, we develop a novel
self-supervised approach for free-space sample generation by leveraging future
ego trajectories and front-view camera images, making the process of visual
corridor estimation dependent on the ego trajectory. We then employ a diffusion
process to model the distribution of such segments in the image. However, the
existing binary mask-based representation for a segment poses many limitations.
Therefore, we introduce ContourDiff, a specialized diffusion-based architecture
that denoises over contour points rather than relying on binary mask
representations, enabling structured and interpretable free-space predictions.
We evaluate our approach qualitatively and quantitatively on both nuScenes and
CARLA, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately predicting safe multimodal
navigable corridors in the image.

Abstract: Image captioning, a task at the confluence of computer vision and natural
language processing, requires a sophisticated understanding of both visual
scenes and linguistic structure. While modern approaches are dominated by
large-scale Transformer architectures, this paper documents a systematic,
iterative development of foundational image captioning models, progressing from
a simple CNN-LSTM encoder-decoder to a competitive attention-based system. We
present a series of five models, beginning with Genesis and concluding with
Nexus, an advanced model featuring an EfficientNetV2B3 backbone and a dynamic
attention mechanism. Our experiments chart the impact of architectural
enhancements and demonstrate a key finding within the classic CNN-LSTM
paradigm: merely upgrading the visual backbone without a corresponding
attention mechanism can degrade performance, as the single-vector bottleneck
cannot transmit the richer visual detail. This insight validates the
architectural shift to attention. Trained on the MS COCO 2017 dataset, our
final model, Nexus, achieves a BLEU-4 score of 31.4, surpassing several
foundational benchmarks and validating our iterative design process. This work
provides a clear, replicable blueprint for understanding the core architectural
principles that underpin modern vision-language tasks.

Conclusion: 研究挑战了直接图像处理的必要性，提出了一种基于面部特征点的高效深度伪造检测方法，适用于多种神经网络模型。

Abstract: The rise of deepfake technology brings forth new questions about the
authenticity of various forms of media found online today. Videos and images
generated by artificial intelligence (AI) have become increasingly more
difficult to differentiate from genuine media, resulting in the need for new
models to detect artificially-generated media. While many models have attempted
to solve this, most focus on direct image processing, adapting a convolutional
neural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN) that directly
interacts with the video image data. This paper introduces an approach of using
solely facial landmarks for deepfake detection. Using a dataset consisting of
both deepfake and genuine videos of human faces, this paper describes an
approach for extracting facial landmarks for deepfake detection, focusing on
identifying subtle inconsistencies in facial movements instead of raw image
processing. Experimental results demonstrated that this feature extraction
technique is effective in various neural network models, with the same facial
landmarks tested on three neural network models, with promising performance
metrics indicating its potential for real-world applications. The findings
discussed in this paper include RNN and artificial neural network (ANN) models
with accuracy between 96% and 93%, respectively, with a CNN model hovering
around 78%. This research challenges the assumption that raw image processing
is necessary to identify deepfake videos by presenting a facial feature
extraction approach compatible with various neural network models while
requiring fewer parameters.

low-rank parameterisation of previous methods and show that Flow-SSNs can
estimate arbitrarily high-rank pixel-wise covariances without assuming the rank
or storing the distributional parameters. Flow-SSNs are also more efficient to
sample from than standard diffusion-based segmentation models, thanks to most
of the model capacity being allocated to learning the base distribution of the
flow, constituting an expressive prior. We apply Flow-SSNs to challenging
medical imaging benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art results. Code

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has advanced WSI analysis but struggles with
the complexity and heterogeneity of WSIs. Existing MIL methods face challenges
in aggregating diverse patch information into robust WSI representations. While
ViTs and clustering-based approaches show promise, they are computationally
intensive and fail to capture task-specific and slide-specific variability. To
address these limitations, we propose PTCMIL, a novel Prompt Token
Clustering-based ViT for MIL aggregation. By introducing learnable prompt
tokens into the ViT backbone, PTCMIL unifies clustering and prediction tasks in
an end-to-end manner. It dynamically aligns clustering with downstream tasks,
using projection-based clustering tailored to each WSI, reducing complexity
while preserving patch heterogeneity. Through token merging and prototype-based
pooling, PTCMIL efficiently captures task-relevant patterns. Extensive
experiments on eight datasets demonstrate its superior performance in
classification and survival analysis tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods. Systematic ablation studies confirm its robustness and strong
interpretability. The code is released at https://github.com/ubc-tea/PTCMIL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接从视觉线索预测单词或字符，但由于音素的视觉模糊性和需要大量预训练数据，错误率较高。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段通过V-ASR预测音素，减少训练复杂度；第二阶段使用NLLB模型将音素重构为单词。

Result: 在LRS2和LRS3数据集上分别实现了17.4%和21.0%的词错误率（WER）。

Conclusion: 该方法通过音素预测和LLM重构，显著提升了视觉语音识别的性能。

Abstract: Visual Automatic Speech Recognition (V-ASR) is a challenging task that
involves interpreting spoken language solely from visual information, such as
lip movements and facial expressions. This task is notably challenging due to
the absence of auditory cues and the visual ambiguity of phonemes that exhibit
similar visemes-distinct sounds that appear identical in lip motions. Existing
methods often aim to predict words or characters directly from visual cues, but
they commonly suffer from high error rates due to viseme ambiguity and require
large amounts of pre-training data. We propose a novel phoneme-based two-stage
framework that fuses visual and landmark motion features, followed by an LLM
model for word reconstruction to address these challenges. Stage 1 consists of
V-ASR, which outputs the predicted phonemes, thereby reducing training
complexity. Meanwhile, the facial landmark features address speaker-specific
facial characteristics. Stage 2 comprises an encoder-decoder LLM model, NLLB,
that reconstructs the output phonemes back to words. Besides using a large
visual dataset for deep learning fine-tuning, our PV-ASR method demonstrates
superior performance by achieving 17.4% WER on the LRS2 and 21.0% WER on the

Conclusion: MAT-Adv通过扰动MAT表示，有效提升了对抗攻击的迁移性和不可防御性。

Abstract: Studying adversarial attacks on point clouds is essential for evaluating and
improving the robustness of 3D deep learning models. However, most existing
attack methods are developed under ideal white-box settings and often suffer
from limited transferability to unseen models and insufficient robustness
against common defense mechanisms. In this paper, we propose MAT-Adv, a novel
adversarial attack framework that enhances both transferability and
undefendability by explicitly perturbing the medial axis transform (MAT)
representations, in order to induce inherent adversarialness in the resulting
point clouds. Specifically, we employ an autoencoder to project input point
clouds into compact MAT representations that capture the intrinsic geometric
structure of point clouds. By perturbing these intrinsic representations,
MAT-Adv introduces structural-level adversarial characteristics that remain
effective across diverse models and defense strategies. To mitigate overfitting
and prevent perturbation collapse, we incorporate a dropout strategy into the
optimization of MAT perturbations, further improving transferability and
undefendability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAT-Adv significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both transferability and
undefendability. Codes will be made public upon paper acceptance.

Conclusion: 通过引入3D几何先验，成功缩小了模态差距，提升了定位性能，数据与代码将在匿名评审后公开。

Abstract: Since a building's floorplans are easily accessible, consistent over time,
and inherently robust to changes in visual appearance, self-localization within
the floorplan has attracted researchers' interest. However, since floorplans
are minimalist representations of a building's structure, modal and geometric
differences between visual perceptions and floorplans pose challenges to this
task. While existing methods cleverly utilize 2D geometric features and pose
filters to achieve promising performance, they fail to address the localization
errors caused by frequent visual changes and view occlusions due to variously
shaped 3D objects. To tackle these issues, this paper views the 2D Floorplan
Localization (FLoc) problem from a higher dimension by injecting 3D geometric
priors into the visual FLoc algorithm. For the 3D geometric prior modeling, we
first model geometrically aware view invariance using multi-view constraints,
i.e., leveraging imaging geometric principles to provide matching constraints
between multiple images that see the same points. Then, we further model the
view-scene aligned geometric priors, enhancing the cross-modal geometry-color
correspondences by associating the scene's surface reconstruction with the RGB
frames of the sequence. Both 3D priors are modeled through self-supervised
contrastive learning, thus no additional geometric or semantic annotations are
required. These 3D priors summarized in extensive realistic scenes bridge the
modal gap while improving localization success without increasing the
computational burden on the FLoc algorithm. Sufficient comparative studies
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
and substantially boosts the FLoc accuracy. All data and code will be released
after the anonymous review.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新任务Syn-to-Real Camouflaged Object Detection (S2R-COD)，并设计了基于师生模型的CSRDA框架，通过伪标签和一致性正则化提升模型在真实场景中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据收集和标注成本高，伪装目标检测(COD)的数据集较少，尤其是某些特殊类别。合成数据集可以缓解数据不足问题，但直接使用会导致性能下降。

Method: 提出Cycling Syn-to-Real Domain Adaptation Framework (CSRDA)，结合伪标签和一致性正则化，利用循环学习框架缩小域内差距。

Result: 实验证明CSRDA有效缓解了数据不足和手工标注的问题。

Conclusion: CSRDA框架在合成到真实的伪装目标检测任务中表现优异，代码已开源。

Abstract: Due to the high cost of collection and labeling, there are relatively few
datasets for camouflaged object detection (COD). In particular, for certain
specialized categories, the available image dataset is insufficiently
populated. Synthetic datasets can be utilized to alleviate the problem of
limited data to some extent. However, directly training with synthetic datasets
compared to real datasets can lead to a degradation in model performance. To
tackle this problem, in this work, we investigate a new task, namely
Syn-to-Real Camouflaged Object Detection (S2R-COD). In order to improve the
model performance in real world scenarios, a set of annotated synthetic
camouflaged images and a limited number of unannotated real images must be
utilized. We propose the Cycling Syn-to-Real Domain Adaptation Framework
(CSRDA), a method based on the student-teacher model. Specially, CSRDA
propagates class information from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled
target domain through pseudo labeling combined with consistency regularization.
Considering that narrowing the intra-domain gap can improve the quality of
pseudo labeling, CSRDA utilizes a recurrent learning framework to build an
evolving real domain for bridging the source and target domain. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, mitigating the
problem of limited data and handcraft annotations in COD. Our code is publicly

TL;DR: HQ-SMem是一种基于智能记忆的高质量视频分割和跟踪方法，通过改进现有VOS模型的局限性，提升了分割精度和处理长视频的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VOS模型在精确掩码划分、可变形对象、拓扑变换对象、跟踪漂移和长视频序列处理方面存在不足，需要一种更高效的方法来解决这些问题。

Method: HQ-SMem结合了SAM-HQ高质量掩码、动态智能记忆机制和动态外观模型更新，优化了分割边界、内存使用和复杂对象变化的处理。

Result: 在多个公共数据集和基准测试中，HQ-SMem表现优异，尤其在VOTS和VOTSt 2024数据集上排名前二，并在长视频场景中设定了新标准。

Conclusion: HQ-SMem通过创新方法显著提升了视频对象分割的性能，特别是在复杂和长视频场景中，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is foundational to numerous computer vision
applications, including surveillance, autonomous driving, robotics and
generative video editing. However, existing VOS models often struggle with
precise mask delineation, deformable objects, topologically transforming
objects, tracking drift and long video sequences. In this paper, we introduce
HQ-SMem, for High Quality video segmentation and tracking using Smart Memory, a
novel method that enhances the performance of VOS base models by addressing
these limitations. Our approach incorporates three key innovations: (i)
leveraging SAM with High-Quality masks (SAM-HQ) alongside appearance-based
candidate-selection to refine coarse segmentation masks, resulting in improved
object boundaries; (ii) implementing a dynamic smart memory mechanism that
selectively stores relevant key frames while discarding redundant ones, thereby
optimizing memory usage and processing efficiency for long-term videos; and
(iii) dynamically updating the appearance model to effectively handle complex
topological object variations and reduce drift throughout the video. These
contributions mitigate several limitations of existing VOS models including,
coarse segmentations that mix-in background pixels, fixed memory update
schedules, brittleness to drift and occlusions, and prompt ambiguity issues
associated with SAM. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple public
datasets and state-of-the-art base trackers demonstrate that our method
consistently ranks among the top two on VOTS and VOTSt 2024 datasets. Moreover,
HQ-SMem sets new benchmarks on Long Video Dataset and LVOS, showcasing its
effectiveness in challenging scenarios characterized by complex multi-object
dynamics over extended temporal durations.

TL;DR: GSSR是一种改进3D高斯分布的方法，通过均匀分布高斯点并优化几何对齐，提升场景重建和编辑效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯分布方法（如3DGS和PGSR）在几何重建上存在不足，高斯点分布不均且偏离潜在表面，导致重建和编辑困难。

Method: GSSR结合单视角和多视角一致性优化高斯分布，引入不透明度正则化损失和周期性重新初始化，实现更均匀的空间分布。

Result: 实验表明GSSR显著提升了几何精度，同时保持了高质量的渲染性能。

Conclusion: GSSR通过优化高斯分布和几何对齐，为场景编辑和新视图生成提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) effectively synthesizes novel views through its
flexible representation, yet fails to accurately reconstruct scene geometry.
While modern variants like PGSR introduce additional losses to ensure proper
depth and normal maps through Gaussian fusion, they still neglect individual
placement optimization. This results in unevenly distributed Gaussians that
deviate from the latent surface, complicating both reconstruction refinement
and scene editing. Motivated by pioneering work on Point Set Surfaces, we
propose Gaussian Set Surface Reconstruction (GSSR), a method designed to
distribute Gaussians evenly along the latent surface while aligning their
dominant normals with the surface normal. GSSR enforces fine-grained geometric
alignment through a combination of pixel-level and Gaussian-level single-view
normal consistency and multi-view photometric consistency, optimizing both
local and global perspectives. To further refine the representation, we
introduce an opacity regularization loss to eliminate redundant Gaussians and
apply periodic depth- and normal-guided Gaussian reinitialization for a
cleaner, more uniform spatial distribution. Our reconstruction results
demonstrate significantly improved geometric precision in Gaussian placement,
enabling intuitive scene editing and efficient generation of novel
Gaussian-based 3D environments. Extensive experiments validate GSSR's
effectiveness, showing enhanced geometric accuracy while preserving
high-quality rendering performance.

<details>

Motivation: 解决红外图像目标检测中因RGB预训练权重与红外图像模态差异导致的鲁棒性问题。

Method: 提出WiSE-OD方法，包括两种变体：WiSE-OD$_{ZS}$和WiSE-OD$_{LP}$，通过集成RGB零样本和红外微调权重提升性能。

Result: WiSE-OD在不增加训练或推理成本的情况下，显著提升了跨模态和抗干扰鲁棒性。

Conclusion: WiSE-OD方法有效解决了红外目标检测中的鲁棒性问题，为跨模态任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Object detection (OD) in infrared (IR) imagery is critical for low-light and
nighttime applications. However, the scarcity of large-scale IR datasets forces
models to rely on weights pre-trained on RGB images. While fine-tuning on IR
improves accuracy, it often compromises robustness under distribution shifts
due to the inherent modality gap between RGB and IR. To address this, we
introduce LLVIP-C and FLIR-C, two cross-modality out-of-distribution (OOD)
benchmarks built by applying corruption to standard IR datasets. Additionally,
to fully leverage the complementary knowledge from RGB and infrared trained
models, we propose WiSE-OD, a weight-space ensembling method with two variants:
WiSE-OD$_{ZS}$, which combines RGB zero-shot and IR fine-tuned weights, and
WiSE-OD$_{LP}$, which blends zero-shot and linear probing. Evaluated across
three RGB-pretrained detectors and two robust baselines, WiSE-OD improves both
cross-modality and corruption robustness without any additional training or
inference cost.

Conclusion: MGHFT通过多视角融合和文本引导，实现了更细粒度的贴图情感识别，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Although pre-trained visual models with text have demonstrated strong
capabilities in visual feature extraction, sticker emotion understanding
remains challenging due to its reliance on multi-view information, such as
background knowledge and stylistic cues. To address this, we propose a novel
multi-granularity hierarchical fusion transformer (MGHFT), with a multi-view
sticker interpreter based on Multimodal Large Language Models. Specifically,
inspired by the human ability to interpret sticker emotions from multiple
views, we first use Multimodal Large Language Models to interpret stickers by
providing rich textual context via multi-view descriptions. Then, we design a
hierarchical fusion strategy to fuse the textual context into visual
understanding, which builds upon a pyramid visual transformer to extract both
global and local sticker features at multiple stages. Through contrastive
learning and attention mechanisms, textual features are injected at different
stages of the visual backbone, enhancing the fusion of global- and
local-granularity visual semantics with textual guidance. Finally, we introduce
a text-guided fusion attention mechanism to effectively integrate the overall
multimodal features, enhancing semantic understanding. Extensive experiments on
2 public sticker emotion datasets demonstrate that MGHFT significantly
outperforms existing sticker emotion recognition approaches, achieving higher
accuracy and more fine-grained emotion recognition. Compared to the best
pre-trained visual models, our MGHFT also obtains an obvious improvement, 5.4%
on F1 and 4.0% on accuracy. The code is released at

Motivation: 解决如何从无序点云中提取有意义的结构信息并转换为语义分布的问题。

Method: 利用扩散模型的新架构和学习策略，通过去噪过程关联源分布和目标分布。

Result: 成功将点云转换为多种结构化输出（如关键点、稀疏关节和特征线），展示了框架对几何和语义特征的捕捉能力。

Conclusion: PDT为需要结构化点分布的3D几何处理任务提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Point-based representations have consistently played a vital role in
geometric data structures. Most point cloud learning and processing methods
typically leverage the unordered and unconstrained nature to represent the
underlying geometry of 3D shapes. However, how to extract meaningful structural
information from unstructured point cloud distributions and transform them into
semantically meaningful point distributions remains an under-explored problem.
We present PDT, a novel framework for point distribution transformation with
diffusion models. Given a set of input points, PDT learns to transform the
point set from its original geometric distribution into a target distribution
that is semantically meaningful. Our method utilizes diffusion models with
novel architecture and learning strategy, which effectively correlates the
source and the target distribution through a denoising process. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method successfully transforms input
point clouds into various forms of structured outputs - ranging from
surface-aligned keypoints, and inner sparse joints to continuous feature lines.
The results showcase our framework's ability to capture both geometric and
semantic features, offering a powerful tool for various 3D geometry processing
tasks where structured point distributions are desired. Code will be available

Abstract: Given an object mask, Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation (SVOS)
technique aims to track and segment the object across video frames, serving as
a fundamental task in computer vision. Although recent memory-based methods
demonstrate potential, they often struggle with scenes involving occlusion,
particularly in handling object interactions and high feature similarity. To
address these issues and meet the real-time processing requirements of
downstream applications, in this paper, we propose a novel bOundary Amendment
video object Segmentation method with Inherent Structure refinement, hereby
named OASIS. Specifically, a lightweight structure refinement module is
proposed to enhance segmentation accuracy. With the fusion of rough edge priors
captured by the Canny filter and stored object features, the module can
generate an object-level structure map and refine the representations by
highlighting boundary features. Evidential learning for uncertainty estimation
is introduced to further address challenges in occluded regions. The proposed
method, OASIS, maintains an efficient design, yet extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate its superior performance and competitive
inference speed compared to other state-of-the-art methods, i.e., achieving the
F values of 91.6 (vs. 89.7 on DAVIS-17 validation set) and G values of 86.6

Abstract: Apical periodontitis is a prevalent oral pathology that presents significant
public health challenges. Despite advances in automated diagnostic systems
across various medical fields, the development of Computer-Aided Diagnosis
(CAD) applications for apical periodontitis is still constrained by the lack of
a large-scale, high-quality annotated dataset. To address this issue, we
release a large-scale panoramic radiograph benchmark called "PerioXrays",
comprising 3,673 images and 5,662 meticulously annotated instances of apical
periodontitis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first benchmark
dataset for automated apical periodontitis diagnosis. This paper further
proposes a clinical-oriented apical periodontitis detection (PerioDet)
paradigm, which jointly incorporates Background-Denoising Attention (BDA) and
IoU-Dynamic Calibration (IDC) mechanisms to address the challenges posed by
background noise and small targets in automated detection. Extensive
experiments on the PerioXrays dataset demonstrate the superiority of PerioDet
in advancing automated apical periodontitis detection. Additionally, a
well-designed human-computer collaborative experiment underscores the clinical
applicability of our method as an auxiliary diagnostic tool for professional

Abstract: Accurate identification of vehicle attributes such as make, colour, and shape
is critical for law enforcement and intelligence applications. This study
evaluates the effectiveness of three state-of-the-art deep learning approaches
YOLO-v11, YOLO-World, and YOLO-Classification on a real-world vehicle image
dataset. This dataset was collected under challenging and unconstrained
conditions by NSW Police Highway Patrol Vehicles. A multi-view inference (MVI)
approach was deployed to enhance the performance of the models' predictions. To
conduct the analyses, datasets with 100,000 plus images were created for each
of the three metadata prediction tasks, specifically make, shape and colour.
The models were tested on a separate dataset with 29,937 images belonging to
1809 number plates. Different sets of experiments have been investigated by
varying the models sizes. A classification accuracy of 93.70%, 82.86%, 85.19%,
and 94.86% was achieved with the best performing make, shape, colour, and
colour-binary models respectively. It was concluded that there is a need to use
MVI to get usable models within such complex real-world datasets. Our findings
indicated that the object detection models YOLO-v11 and YOLO-World outperformed
classification-only models in make and shape extraction. Moreover, smaller YOLO
variants perform comparably to larger counterparts, offering substantial
efficiency benefits for real-time predictions. This work provides a robust
baseline for extracting vehicle metadata in real-world scenarios. Such models
can be used in filtering and sorting user queries, minimising the time required

Conclusion: GR-CLIP有效解决了模态间隙问题，显著提升了混合模态搜索的性能和效率。

Abstract: Mixed modality search -- retrieving information across a heterogeneous corpus
composed of images, texts, and multimodal documents -- is an important yet
underexplored real-world application. In this work, we investigate how
contrastive vision-language models, such as CLIP, perform on the mixed modality
search task. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation: these models exhibit a
pronounced modality gap in the embedding space, where image and text embeddings
form distinct clusters, leading to intra-modal ranking bias and inter-modal
fusion failure. To address this issue, we propose GR-CLIP, a lightweight
post-hoc calibration method that removes the modality gap in CLIP's embedding
space. Evaluated on MixBench -- the first benchmark specifically designed for
mixed modality search -- GR-CLIP improves NDCG@10 by up to 26 percentage points
over CLIP, surpasses recent vision-language generative embedding models by 4
percentage points, while using 75x less compute.

under diverse conditions, such as low visibility and variable depths. From the
above-mentioned models, YOLOv8 outperformed the others, with a mean Average

computational costs when applied to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. To address
these challenges, we propose AEDR (AutoEncoder Double-Reconstruction), a novel
training-free attribution method designed for generative models with continuous
autoencoders. Unlike existing reconstruction-based approaches that rely on the
value of a single reconstruction loss, AEDR performs two consecutive
reconstructions using the model's autoencoder, and adopts the ratio of these
two reconstruction losses as the attribution signal. This signal is further
calibrated using the image homogeneity metric to improve accuracy, which
inherently cancels out absolute biases caused by image complexity, with
autoencoder-based reconstruction ensuring superior computational efficiency.
Experiments on eight top latent diffusion models show that AEDR achieves 25.5%
higher attribution accuracy than existing reconstruction-based methods, while
requiring only 1% of the computational time.

*Zixiang Ai,Zhenyu Cui,Yuxin Peng,Jiahuan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的点级提示方法，通过提示机制解决点云去噪和补全问题，提升下游任务的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因点云增强与下游任务隔离，无法适应多样化真实场景，且去噪与补全任务目标冲突。

Method: 引入Rectification Prompter和Completion Prompter，结合Shape-Aware Unit模块，统一捕捉几何特征。

Result: 在四个数据集上验证了方法的优越性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在噪声和不完整点云数据处理上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Pre-trained point cloud analysis models have shown promising advancements in
various downstream tasks, yet their effectiveness is typically suffering from
low-quality point cloud (i.e., noise and incompleteness), which is a common
issue in real scenarios due to casual object occlusions and unsatisfactory data
collected by 3D sensors. To this end, existing methods focus on enhancing point
cloud quality by developing dedicated denoising and completion models. However,
due to the isolation between the point cloud enhancement and downstream tasks,
these methods fail to work in various real-world domains. In addition, the
conflicting objectives between denoising and completing tasks further limit the
ensemble paradigm to preserve critical geometric features. To tackle the above
challenges, we propose a unified point-level prompting method that reformulates
point cloud denoising and completion as a prompting mechanism, enabling robust
analysis in a parameter-efficient manner. We start by introducing a
Rectification Prompter to adapt to noisy points through the predicted
rectification vector prompts, effectively filtering noise while preserving
intricate geometric features essential for accurate analysis. Sequentially, we
further incorporate a Completion Prompter to generate auxiliary point prompts
based on the rectified point clouds, facilitating their robustness and
adaptability. Finally, a Shape-Aware Unit module is exploited to efficiently
unify and capture the filtered geometric features for the downstream point
cloud analysis.Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the
superiority and robustness of our method when handling noisy and incomplete
point cloud data against existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
released at https://github.com/zhoujiahuan1991/ICCV2025-UPP.

*Yongsong Huang,Tomo Miyazaki,Xiaofeng Liu,Shinichiro Omachi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPSMamba框架通过结合语义-频率提示和非因果监督，解决了红外图像超分辨率中全局上下文碎片化的问题，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外图像超分辨率（IRSR）因低对比度和稀疏纹理而具有挑战性，需要强大的长程建模以保持全局一致性。现有的状态空间模型（如Mamba）虽擅长长程依赖建模，但其1D因果扫描机制会破坏2D图像的全局上下文，影响细节恢复。

Method: 提出GPSMamba框架，包括自适应语义-频率状态空间模块（ASF-SSM）和热谱注意力与相位一致性损失。ASF-SSM将融合的语义-频率提示注入Mamba块以整合非局部上下文；热谱注意力与相位一致性损失提供非因果监督，确保全局结构和光谱保真度。

Result: 实验表明，GPSMamba在红外图像恢复任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: GPSMamba通过系统策略解决了因果建模的局限性，为红外图像恢复提供了新的有效范式。

Abstract: Infrared Image Super-Resolution (IRSR) is challenged by the low contrast and
sparse textures of infrared data, requiring robust long-range modeling to
maintain global coherence. While State-Space Models like Mamba offer
proficiency in modeling long-range dependencies for this task, their inherent
1D causal scanning mechanism fragments the global context of 2D images,
hindering fine-detail restoration. To address this, we propose Global Phase and
Spectral Prompt-guided Mamba (GPSMamba), a framework that synergizes
architectural guidance with non-causal supervision. First, our Adaptive
Semantic-Frequency State Space Module (ASF-SSM) injects a fused
semantic-frequency prompt directly into the Mamba block, integrating non-local
context to guide reconstruction. Then, a novel Thermal-Spectral Attention and
Phase Consistency Loss provides explicit, non-causal supervision to enforce
global structural and spectral fidelity. By combining these two innovations,
our work presents a systematic strategy to mitigate the limitations of causal
modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPSMamba achieves
state-of-the-art performance, validating our approach as a powerful new
paradigm for infrared image restoration. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的图像评估框架ICT和HP评分，解决了现有评估模型在细节和美学评分上的不足，显著提升了评分准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成系统的评估框架未能跟上其高保真和美学质量的进步，导致评分与人类偏好不一致。

Method: 设计了ICT评分以改进文本-图像对齐评估，并训练HP评分模型以提升图像美学和细节质量。

Result: 实验表明，新模型评分准确性提升超过10%，并在优化文本到图像模型中取得显著效果。

Conclusion: 该研究为图像生成技术向更高阶人类美学偏好发展提供了理论和实证支持。

Abstract: Contemporary image generation systems have achieved high fidelity and
superior aesthetic quality beyond basic text-image alignment. However, existing
evaluation frameworks have failed to evolve in parallel. This study reveals
that human preference reward models fine-tuned based on CLIP and BLIP
architectures have inherent flaws: they inappropriately assign low scores to
images with rich details and high aesthetic value, creating a significant
discrepancy with actual human aesthetic preferences. To address this issue, we
design a novel evaluation score, ICT (Image-Contained-Text) score, that
achieves and surpasses the objectives of text-image alignment by assessing the
degree to which images represent textual content. Building upon this
foundation, we further train an HP (High-Preference) score model using solely
the image modality to enhance image aesthetics and detail quality while
maintaining text-image alignment. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
evaluation model improves scoring accuracy by over 10\% compared to existing
methods, and achieves significant results in optimizing state-of-the-art
text-to-image models. This research provides theoretical and empirical support
for evolving image generation technology toward higher-order human aesthetic
preferences. Code is available at https://github.com/BarretBa/ICTHP.

Abstract: Rapid advances in medical imaging technology underscore the critical need for
precise and automated image quality assessment (IQA) to ensure diagnostic
accuracy. Existing medical IQA methods, however, struggle to generalize across
diverse modalities and clinical scenarios. In response, we introduce MedIQA,
the first comprehensive foundation model for medical IQA, designed to handle
variability in image dimensions, modalities, anatomical regions, and types. We
developed a large-scale multi-modality dataset with plentiful manually
annotated quality scores to support this. Our model integrates a salient slice
assessment module to focus on diagnostically relevant regions feature retrieval
and employs an automatic prompt strategy that aligns upstream physical
parameter pre-training with downstream expert annotation fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MedIQA significantly outperforms baselines in
multiple downstream tasks, establishing a scalable framework for medical IQA
and advancing diagnostic workflows and clinical decision-making.

Result: 论文系统分析了幻觉问题，总结了现有评估基准和检测方法，并指出了当前研究的局限性。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注改进评估基准和检测方法，以更有效地解决多模态任务中的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm
for integrating visual and textual information, supporting a wide range of
multi-modal tasks. However, these models often suffer from hallucination,
producing content that appears plausible but contradicts the input content or
established world knowledge. This survey offers an in-depth review of
hallucination evaluation benchmarks and detection methods across Image-to-Text
(I2T) and Text-to-image (T2I) generation tasks. Specifically, we first propose
a taxonomy of hallucination based on faithfulness and factuality, incorporating
the common types of hallucinations observed in practice. Then we provide an
overview of existing hallucination evaluation benchmarks for both T2I and I2T
tasks, highlighting their construction process, evaluation objectives, and
employed metrics. Furthermore, we summarize recent advances in hallucination
detection methods, which aims to identify hallucinated content at the instance
level and serve as a practical complement of benchmark-based evaluation.
Finally, we highlight key limitations in current benchmarks and detection
methods, and outline potential directions for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像描述评估缺乏标准化、偏见意识和用户偏好考量，LOTUS旨在解决这些问题。

Method: LOTUS通过多维度评估（如描述质量、风险和社会偏见）并结合用户偏好，对大型视觉语言模型进行综合评测。

Result: 评测显示，没有单一模型在所有标准上表现优异，且描述细节与偏见风险存在相关性。用户偏好影响最优模型选择。

Conclusion: LOTUS为图像描述评估提供了全面框架，强调用户偏好和多样性需求的重要性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have transformed image captioning,
shifting from concise captions to detailed descriptions. We introduce LOTUS, a
leaderboard for evaluating detailed captions, addressing three main gaps in
existing evaluations: lack of standardized criteria, bias-aware assessments,
and user preference considerations. LOTUS comprehensively evaluates various
aspects, including caption quality (e.g., alignment, descriptiveness), risks
(\eg, hallucination), and societal biases (e.g., gender bias) while enabling
preference-oriented evaluations by tailoring criteria to diverse user
preferences. Our analysis of recent LVLMs reveals no single model excels across
all criteria, while correlations emerge between caption detail and bias risks.
Preference-oriented evaluations demonstrate that optimal model selection
depends on user priorities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的单次联邦学习框架，结合特征引导修正流模型（FG-RF）和双层知识蒸馏（DLKD），解决了医疗领域中的训练效率低、隐私泄露和非IID数据问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于生成模型的单次联邦学习方法在医疗领域存在训练效率低、隐私泄露风险高，且难以在非IID数据下实现单轮收敛。

Method: 提出FG-RF模型加速生成建模并保护隐私，使用DLKD方法在聚合时对齐中间层特征和输出逻辑。

Result: 在三个非IID医疗数据集上，新框架比多轮联邦学习方法提升21.73%，平均优于基线FedISCA 21.75%。

Conclusion: 新框架显著提升了训练效率和隐私保护能力，尤其在非IID数据下表现优异。

Abstract: In multi-center scenarios, One-Shot Federated Learning (OSFL) has attracted
increasing attention due to its low communication overhead, requiring only a
single round of transmission. However, existing generative model-based OSFL
methods suffer from low training efficiency and potential privacy leakage in
the healthcare domain. Additionally, achieving convergence within a single
round of model aggregation is challenging under non-Independent and Identically
Distributed (non-IID) data. To address these challenges, in this paper a
modified OSFL framework is proposed, in which a new Feature-Guided Rectified
Flow Model (FG-RF) and Dual-Layer Knowledge Distillation (DLKD) aggregation
method are developed. FG-RF on the client side accelerates generative modeling
in medical imaging scenarios while preserving privacy by synthesizing
feature-level images rather than pixel-level images. To handle non-IID
distributions, DLKD enables the global student model to simultaneously mimic
the output logits and align the intermediate-layer features of client-side
teacher models during aggregation. Experimental results on three non-IID
medical imaging datasets show that our new framework and method outperform
multi-round federated learning approaches, achieving up to 21.73% improvement,
and exceeds the baseline FedISCA by an average of 21.75%. Furthermore, our
experiments demonstrate that feature-level synthetic images significantly
reduce privacy leakage risks compared to pixel-level synthetic images.

Motivation: 解决计算神经科学中预测大脑对自然多模态刺激反应的关键挑战，并测试模型在新情境下的泛化能力。

Method: 使用先进的视觉（X-CLIP）和听觉（Whisper）特征提取器构建大脑编码模型，并在分布内和分布外数据上进行严格评估。

Result: 高容量注意力模型在分布内数据上表现优异，但线性模型在分布外数据上更稳健，性能提升18%。语言特征未提高预测准确性。

Conclusion: 严格的分布外测试对构建稳健的神经AI模型至关重要，模型架构、刺激特性和感官层级共同影响多模态世界的神经编码。

Abstract: Predicting brain activity in response to naturalistic, multimodal stimuli is
a key challenge in computational neuroscience. While encoding models are
becoming more powerful, their ability to generalize to truly novel contexts
remains a critical, often untested, question. In this work, we developed brain
encoding models using state-of-the-art visual (X-CLIP) and auditory (Whisper)
feature extractors and rigorously evaluated them on both in-distribution (ID)
and diverse out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our results reveal a fundamental
trade-off between model complexity and generalization: a higher-capacity
attention-based model excelled on ID data, but a simpler linear model was more
robust, outperforming a competitive baseline by 18\% on the OOD set.
Intriguingly, we found that linguistic features did not improve predictive
accuracy, suggesting that for familiar languages, neural encoding may be
dominated by the continuous visual and auditory streams over redundant textual
information. Spatially, our approach showed marked performance gains in the
auditory cortex, underscoring the benefit of high-fidelity speech
representations. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that rigorous OOD
testing is essential for building robust neuro-AI models and provides nuanced
insights into how model architecture, stimulus characteristics, and sensory
hierarchies shape the neural encoding of our rich, multimodal world.

Result: 研究发现视觉定位对任务成功至关重要，任务规划和跨平台泛化能力是可靠自动化的关键，且当前模型存在效率低下的问题。

Conclusion: MMBench-GUI为GUI自动化代理提供了全面评估工具，强调精确定位、有效规划和效率优化的重要性。

Abstract: We introduce MMBench-GUI, a hierarchical benchmark for evaluating GUI
automation agents across Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and Web
platforms. It comprises four levels: GUI Content Understanding, Element
Grounding, Task Automation, and Task Collaboration, covering essential skills
for GUI agents. In addition, we propose a novel Efficiency-Quality Area (EQA)
metric to assess GUI agent execution efficiency in online automation scenarios.
Through MMBench-GUI, we identify accurate visual grounding as a critical
determinant of overall task success, emphasizing the substantial benefits of
modular frameworks that integrate specialized grounding modules. Furthermore,
to achieve reliable GUI automation, an agent requires strong task planning and
cross-platform generalization abilities, with long-context memory, a broad
action space, and long-term reasoning playing a critical role. More important,
task efficiency remains a critically underexplored dimension, and all models
suffer from substantial inefficiencies, with excessive redundant steps even
when tasks are ultimately completed. The integration of precise localization,
effective planning, and early stopping strategies is indispensable to enable
truly efficient and scalable GUI automation. Our benchmark code, evaluation
data, and running environment will be publicly available at

Result: 实验表明，ScenePainter能生成更一致且沉浸的3D视图序列。

Conclusion: ScenePainter通过语义对齐和动态优化，有效解决了语义漂移问题，提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Perpetual 3D scene generation aims to produce long-range and coherent 3D view
sequences, which is applicable for long-term video synthesis and 3D scene
reconstruction. Existing methods follow a "navigate-and-imagine" fashion and
rely on outpainting for successive view expansion. However, the generated view
sequences suffer from semantic drift issue derived from the accumulated
deviation of the outpainting module. To tackle this challenge, we propose
ScenePainter, a new framework for semantically consistent 3D scene generation,
which aligns the outpainter's scene-specific prior with the comprehension of
the current scene. To be specific, we introduce a hierarchical graph structure
dubbed SceneConceptGraph to construct relations among multi-level scene
concepts, which directs the outpainter for consistent novel views and can be
dynamically refined to enhance diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our framework overcomes the semantic drift issue and generates more
consistent and immersive 3D view sequences. Project Page:

Motivation: Transformer-based检测器在小目标检测中仍面临特征金字塔网络（FPN）的噪声敏感性和标签分配策略中查询质量下降的问题。

Method: NRQO通过NT-FPN在特征融合中减少噪声，PS-RPN通过位置和形状相似性生成高质量正查询。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，NRQO表现优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: NRQO通过创新的噪声容忍和查询优化策略，有效解决了小目标检测中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Despite advancements in Transformer-based detectors for small object
detection (SOD), recent studies show that these detectors still face challenges
due to inherent noise sensitivity in feature pyramid networks (FPN) and
diminished query quality in existing label assignment strategies. In this
paper, we propose a novel Noise-Resilient Query Optimization (NRQO) paradigm,
which innovatively incorporates the Noise-Tolerance Feature Pyramid Network
(NT-FPN) and the Pairwise-Similarity Region Proposal Network (PS-RPN).
Specifically, NT-FPN mitigates noise during feature fusion in FPN by preserving
spatial and semantic information integrity. Unlike existing label assignment
strategies, PS-RPN generates a sufficient number of high-quality positive
queries by enhancing anchor-ground truth matching through position and shape
similarities, without the need for additional hyperparameters. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks consistently demonstrate the superiority of
NRQO over state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 现实应用中需要模型识别虚假或不存在的内容（如医学图像排除特定条件），但现有VLM在否定理解上表现不佳，且传统数据驱动方法资源消耗大。

Method: 提出NEAT方法，通过调整推理过程中的分布相关参数，减少语义一致性的分布偏移并消除无关语义的虚假一致性。

Result: 在多种否定理解任务上的实验验证了NEAT的有效性。

Conclusion: NEAT提供了一种低资源消耗的解决方案，显著提升了VLM的否定理解能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we study a practical but less-touched problem in
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), \ie, negation understanding. Specifically, many
real-world applications require models to explicitly identify what is false or
non-existent, \eg, radiologists may search for images that exclude specific
conditions. Despite the impressive transferability of VLMs through large-scale
training, they suffer from a critical limitation that fails to handle negation.
To address this challenge, existing methods attribute its root cause to the
scarcity of negation training data and propose to fine-tune VLMs on massive
data containing explicit negation. Undoubtedly, such data-centric solutions
demand substantial data and computational resources, limiting their sustainable
widespread adoption. To tackle negation in a low-carbon manner, we empirically
observe that the key obstacle lies in the dual-concept shifts between the
affirmation and negation distributions. Therefore, we propose a Negation-Aware
Test-Time Adaptation (NEAT) method to efficiently adjust distribution-related
parameters during inference. In brief, NEAT can reduce distribution shift in
consistent semantics while eliminating false distributional consistency in
unrelated semantics. Extensive experiments on the various negation
understanding tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code
is available at https://github.com/hhc1997/NEAT.

Result: 在基准数据集上定性和定量评估均优于现有方法，且对新被试适应性强。

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了fMRI信号解码的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Decoding stimulus images from fMRI signals has advanced with pre-trained
generative models. However, existing methods struggle with cross-subject
mappings due to cognitive variability and subject-specific differences. This
challenge arises from sequential errors, where unidirectional mappings generate
partially inaccurate representations that, when fed into diffusion models,
accumulate errors and degrade reconstruction fidelity. To address this, we
propose the Bidirectional Autoencoder Intertwining framework for accurate
decoded representation prediction. Our approach unifies multiple subjects
through a Subject Bias Modulation Module while leveraging bidirectional mapping
to better capture data distributions for precise representation prediction. To
further enhance fidelity when decoding representations into stimulus images, we
introduce a Semantic Refinement Module to improve semantic representations and
a Visual Coherence Module to mitigate the effects of inaccurate visual
representations. Integrated with ControlNet and Stable Diffusion, our method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark datasets in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Moreover, our framework exhibits
strong adaptability to new subjects with minimal training samples.

Result: 在三个医学异常检测基准测试中表现优异，验证了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SP-Mamba为医学异常检测提供了一种高效且性能优越的新方法。

Abstract: Radiography imaging protocols target on specific anatomical regions,
resulting in highly consistent images with recurrent structural patterns across
patients. Recent advances in medical anomaly detection have demonstrated the
effectiveness of CNN- and transformer-based approaches. However, CNNs exhibit
limitations in capturing long-range dependencies, while transformers suffer
from quadratic computational complexity. In contrast, Mamba-based models,
leveraging superior long-range modeling, structural feature extraction, and
linear computational efficiency, have emerged as a promising alternative. To
capitalize on the inherent structural regularity of medical images, this study
introduces SP-Mamba, a spatial-perception Mamba framework for unsupervised
medical anomaly detection. The window-sliding prototype learning and
Circular-Hilbert scanning-based Mamba are introduced to better exploit
consistent anatomical patterns and leverage spatial information for medical
anomaly detection. Furthermore, we excavate the concentration and contrast
characteristics of anomaly maps for improving anomaly detection. Extensive
experiments on three diverse medical anomaly detection benchmarks confirm the
proposed method's state-of-the-art performance, validating its efficacy and
robustness. The code is available at https://github.com/Ray-RuiPan/SP-Mamba.

Result: FGMoE在NYUD-v2和PASCAL-Context数据集上，使用更少参数，显著优于当前基于MoE的竞争模型。

Conclusion: FGMoE通过细粒度专家设计和微调，有效提升了多任务学习的性能与参数效率。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) for dense prediction has shown promising results
but still faces challenges in balancing shared representations with
task-specific specialization. In this paper, we introduce a novel Fine-Grained
Mixture of Experts (FGMoE) architecture that explores MoE-based MTL models
through a combination of three key innovations and fine-tuning. First, we
propose intra-task experts that partition along intermediate hidden dimensions
of MLPs, enabling finer decomposition of task information while maintaining
parameter efficiency. Second, we introduce shared experts that consolidate
common information across different contexts of the same task, reducing
redundancy, and allowing routing experts to focus on unique aspects. Third, we
design a global expert that facilitates adaptive knowledge transfer across
tasks based on both input feature and task requirements, promoting beneficial
information sharing while preventing harmful interference. In addition, we use
the fine-tuning approach to improve parameter efficiency only by training the
parameters of the decoder. Extensive experimental results show that the
proposed FGMoE uses fewer parameters and significantly outperforms current
MoE-based competitive MTL models on two dense prediction datasets
(\textit{i.e.,} NYUD-v2, PASCAL-Context) in various metrics.

Result: 在四个MedMNIST数据集上，分类准确率和AUC与基线相当或更优，同时提供可靠的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: MedSymmFlow在医学图像分类和不确定性量化方面表现优异，适用于临床高风险场景。

Abstract: Reliable medical image classification requires accurate predictions and
well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, especially in high-stakes clinical
settings. This work presents MedSymmFlow, a generative-discriminative hybrid
model built on Symmetrical Flow Matching, designed to unify classification,
generation, and uncertainty quantification in medical imaging. MedSymmFlow
leverages a latent-space formulation that scales to high-resolution inputs and
introduces a semantic mask conditioning mechanism to enhance diagnostic
relevance. Unlike standard discriminative models, it naturally estimates
uncertainty through its generative sampling process. The model is evaluated on
four MedMNIST datasets, covering a range of modalities and pathologies. The
results show that MedSymmFlow matches or exceeds the performance of established
baselines in classification accuracy and AUC, while also delivering reliable
uncertainty estimates validated by performance improvements under selective
prediction.

TL;DR: 提出LISA方法，通过层次调制和多层融合减少多模态大语言模型中的物体幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在图像描述任务中容易产生物体幻觉的问题。

Method: 采用层次调制和基于锚点的路由融合方法，稳定注意力并自适应整合解码信息。

Result: 在CHAIR_I基准上减少53.6%的幻觉，POPE F1提升4.5%。

Conclusion: LISA是一种即插即用的方法，能有效减少幻觉并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks such
as image captioning but remain prone to object hallucinations, where they
describe objects that do not appear in the image. To mitigate this, we propose
\textbf{LISA}, a \textbf{L}ayer-wise \textbf{I}ntegration and
\textbf{S}uppression \textbf{A}pproach that enhances generation consistency
through hierarchical modulation and multi-layer fusion. LISA leverages the
functional hierarchy within MLLMs, where shallow layers provide visual
grounding, middle layers encode semantics, and deep layers tend to amplify
spurious signals. First, zone-specific spectral modulation stabilizes attention
by suppressing over-amplified activations in deeper layers while preserving
alignment cues in earlier layers. Second, token-level logits from selected
layers are fused via anchor-based routing, with token-wise anchor selection and
soft logit fusion enabling adaptive integration during decoding. LISA is fully
\textbf{plug-and-play} and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs,
including Qwen2.5-VL. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that LISA reduces
hallucinations by up to 53.6\% in $\mathrm{CHAIR}_I$ and improves POPE F1 by
4.5\%, demonstrating strong generalization across models and tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在全连接层提取特征时难以有效捕捉跨模态相似性，导致匹配效果不佳。

Method: CSTF通过创建对应映射和将相似性匹配重新定义为分类任务（使用SoftMax和FCN层），结合局部特征和上下文信息。

Result: 在HRSC2016和DOTA数据集上分别达到90.99%和90.86%的mAP，推理速度为12.5 FPS。

Conclusion: CSTF显著提升了跨模态特征匹配性能，直接增强了遥感应用（如目标检测）的效果。

Abstract: Effectively describing features for cross-modal remote sensing image matching
remains a challenging task due to the significant geometric and radiometric
differences between multimodal images. Existing methods primarily extract
features at the fully connected layer but often fail to capture cross-modal
similarities effectively. We propose a Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion (CSTF)
mechanism that enhances feature representation by integrating scale-invariant
keypoints detected independently in both reference and query images. Our
approach improves feature matching in two ways: First, by creating
correspondence maps that leverage information from multiple image regions
simultaneously, and second, by reformulating the similarity matching process as
a classification task using SoftMax and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)
layers. This dual approach enables CSTF to maintain sensitivity to distinctive
local features while incorporating broader contextual information, resulting in
robust matching across diverse remote sensing modalities. To demonstrate the
practical utility of improved feature matching, we evaluate CSTF on object
detection tasks using the HRSC2016 and DOTA benchmark datasets. Our method
achieves state-of-theart performance with an average mAP of 90.99% on HRSC2016
and 90.86% on DOTA, outperforming existing models. The CSTF model maintains
computational efficiency with an inference speed of 12.5 FPS. These results
validate that our approach to crossmodal feature matching directly enhances
downstream remote sensing applications such as object detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于点和网格的方法在建模人类运动动态时存在局限性，无法平衡局部运动细节与长时空依赖关系，且时间表示缺乏与频域的交互。

Method: 提出PatchTraj框架，将轨迹分解为原始时间序列和频率分量，通过动态补丁分区进行多尺度轨迹分割，采用自适应嵌入层和层次特征聚合建模依赖关系，并通过跨模态注意力融合时域和频域信息。

Result: 在ETH-UCY、SDD、NBA和JRDB数据集上的实验表明，PatchTraj实现了最先进的性能和高效率。

Conclusion: PatchTraj通过统一时域和频域表示，显著提升了轨迹预测的准确性，为自动驾驶和机器人领域提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving and
robotics. While existing point-based and grid-based methods expose two key
limitations: insufficiently modeling human motion dynamics, as they fail to
balance local motion details with long-range spatiotemporal dependencies, and
the time representation lacks interaction with the frequency domain in modeling
trajectory sequences. To address these challenges, we propose PatchTraj, a
dynamic patch-based trajectory prediction framework that unifies time-domain
and frequency-domain representations. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory
into raw time sequences and frequency components, employing dynamic patch
partitioning for multi-scale trajectory segmentation to capture hierarchical
motion patterns. Each patch is processed by an adaptive embedding layer with
scale-aware feature extraction, followed by hierarchical feature aggregation to
model both fine-grained and long-range dependencies. The outputs of two
branches interact via cross-modal attention, enabling complementary fusion of
temporal and spectral cues. Finally, a Transformer encoder-decoder integrates
both modalities to autoregressively predict future trajectories. Extensive
experiments on ETH-UCY, SDD, NBA, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定量和定性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TopGeoFormer通过结合拓扑和几何特征，显著提升了点云恢复的效果。

Abstract: Recovering point clouds involves the sequential process of sampling and
restoration, yet existing methods struggle to effectively leverage both
topological and geometric attributes. To address this, we propose an end-to-end
architecture named \textbf{TopGeoFormer}, which maintains these critical
features throughout the sampling and restoration phases. First, we revisit
traditional feature extraction techniques to yield topological embedding using
a continuous mapping of relative relationships between neighboring points, and
integrate it in both phases for preserving the structure of the original space.
Second, we propose the \textbf{InterTwining Attention} to fully merge
topological and geometric embeddings, which queries shape with local awareness
in both phases to form a learnable shape context facilitated with point-wise,
point-shape-wise, and intra-shape features. Third, we introduce a full geometry
loss and a topological constraint loss to optimize the embeddings in both
Euclidean and topological spaces. The geometry loss uses inconsistent matching
between coarse-to-fine generations and targets for reconstructing better
geometric details, and the constraint loss limits embedding variances for
better approximation of the topological space. In experiments, we
comprehensively analyze the circumstances using the conventional and
learning-based sampling/upsampling algorithms. The quantitative and qualitative
results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing sampling
and recovery methods.

TL;DR: MixA-Q是一种混合精度激活量化框架，利用层内激活稀疏性优化窗口视觉Transformer的推理效率，在性能和效率之间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过利用激活稀疏性，减少不重要窗口的计算量，提升量化模型的效率。

Method: 提出Two-Branch Swin Block，分离高低精度激活处理，兼容QAT和PTQ方法。

Result: 在COCO数据集上，MixA-Q在PTQ配置下实现1.35倍加速且无精度损失，QAT下实现1.25倍加速或1.53倍加速（仅1% mAP下降）。

Conclusion: MixA-Q通过稀疏感知量化适配，显著减少量化误差，提升模型性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose MixA-Q, a mixed-precision activation quantization
framework that leverages intra-layer activation sparsity (a concept widely
explored in activation pruning methods) for efficient inference of quantized
window-based vision transformers. For a given uniform-bit quantization
configuration, MixA-Q separates the batched window computations within Swin
blocks and assigns a lower bit width to the activations of less important
windows, improving the trade-off between model performance and efficiency. We
introduce a Two-Branch Swin Block that processes activations separately in
high- and low-bit precision, enabling seamless integration of our method with
most quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ)
methods, or with simple modifications. Our experimental evaluations over the
COCO dataset demonstrate that MixA-Q achieves a training-free 1.35x
computational speedup without accuracy loss in PTQ configuration. With QAT,
MixA-Q achieves a lossless 1.25x speedup and a 1.53x speedup with only a 1% mAP
drop by incorporating activation pruning. Notably, by reducing the quantization
error in important regions, our sparsity-aware quantization adaptation improves
the mAP of the quantized W4A4 model (with both weights and activations in 4-bit
precision) by 0.7%, reducing quantization degradation by 24%.

Motivation: 现有少样本分割方法中，原型学习预测保守，亲和力学习预测激进，需要平衡两者以提高性能。

Method: 提出PAHNet，包含原型引导特征增强（PFE）模块和注意力分数校准（ASC）模块，利用预训练原型预测器优化亲和力学习模型。

Result: 在PASCAL-5i和COCO-20i数据集上，PAHNet在1-shot和5-shot设置中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PAHNet通过平衡保守和激进信息，有效提升了少样本分割的准确性。

Abstract: This paper studies the few-shot segmentation (FSS) task, which aims to
segment objects belonging to unseen categories in a query image by learning a
model on a small number of well-annotated support samples. Our analysis of two
mainstream FSS paradigms reveals that the predictions made by prototype
learning methods are usually conservative, while those of affinity learning
methods tend to be more aggressive. This observation motivates us to balance
the conservative and aggressive information captured by these two types of FSS
frameworks so as to improve the segmentation performance. To achieve this, we
propose a **P**rototype-**A**ffinity **H**ybrid **Net**work (PAHNet), which
introduces a Prototype-guided Feature Enhancement (PFE) module and an Attention
Score Calibration (ASC) module in each attention block of an affinity learning
model (called affinity learner). These two modules utilize the predictions
generated by a pre-trained prototype learning model (called prototype
predictor) to enhance the foreground information in support and query image
representations and suppress the mismatched foreground-background (FG-BG)
relationships between them, respectively. In this way, the aggressiveness of
the affinity learner can be effectively mitigated, thereby eventually
increasing the segmentation accuracy of our PAHNet method. Experimental results
show that PAHNet outperforms most recently proposed methods across 1-shot and
5-shot settings on both PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets, suggesting its
effectiveness. The code is available at: [GitHub - tianyu-zou/PAHNet: Balancing

TL;DR: DASH提出了一种实时动态场景渲染框架，结合4D哈希编码与自监督分解，解决了现有方法中的特征重叠和渲染质量差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态场景重建在3D视觉中是一个长期挑战，现有方法因低秩假设导致特征重叠和渲染质量不佳。

Method: 采用自监督分解机制分离动态与静态组件，引入多分辨率4D哈希编码器，并提出时空平滑正则化策略。

Result: 在真实数据集上，DASH实现了264 FPS的实时渲染性能，视觉质量显著提升。

Conclusion: DASH通过创新方法解决了动态场景渲染中的关键问题，实现了高质量的实时渲染。

Abstract: Dynamic scene reconstruction is a long-term challenge in 3D vision. Existing
plane-based methods in dynamic Gaussian splatting suffer from an unsuitable
low-rank assumption, causing feature overlap and poor rendering quality.
Although 4D hash encoding provides an explicit representation without low-rank
constraints, directly applying it to the entire dynamic scene leads to
substantial hash collisions and redundancy. To address these challenges, we
present DASH, a real-time dynamic scene rendering framework that employs 4D
hash encoding coupled with self-supervised decomposition. Our approach begins
with a self-supervised decomposition mechanism that separates dynamic and
static components without manual annotations or precomputed masks. Next, we
introduce a multiresolution 4D hash encoder for dynamic elements, providing an
explicit representation that avoids the low-rank assumption. Finally, we
present a spatio-temporal smoothness regularization strategy to mitigate
unstable deformation artifacts. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
that DASH achieves state-of-the-art dynamic rendering performance, exhibiting
enhanced visual quality at real-time speeds of 264 FPS on a single 4090 GPU.

Result: 在保持分类准确性的同时提高了计算效率，重叠补丁嵌入进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在训练和推理中均适用，为高效视觉Transformer提供了一种可行方案。

Abstract: Multi-head self-attention is a distinctive feature extraction mechanism of
vision transformers that computes pairwise relationships among all input
patches, contributing significantly to their high performance. However, it is
known to incur a quadratic computational complexity with respect to the number
of patches. One promising approach to address this issue is patch pruning,
which improves computational efficiency by identifying and removing redundant
patches. In this work, we propose a patch pruning strategy that evaluates the
importance of each patch based on the variance of attention weights across
multiple attention heads. This approach is inspired by the design of multi-head
self-attention, which aims to capture diverse attention patterns across
different subspaces of feature representations. The proposed method can be
easily applied during both training and inference, and achieves improved
throughput while maintaining classification accuracy in scenarios such as
fine-tuning with pre-trained models. In addition, we also found that using
robust statistical measures, such as the median absolute deviation in place of
variance, to assess patch importance can similarly lead to strong performance.
Furthermore, by introducing overlapping patch embeddings, our method achieves
better performance with comparable throughput to conventional approaches that
utilize all patches.

Conclusion: 提出的框架在多种天气条件下表现出色，且减少了对配对训练数据的依赖。

Abstract: Restoration of images contaminated by different adverse weather conditions
such as fog, snow, and rain is a challenging task due to the varying nature of
the weather conditions. Most of the existing methods focus on any one
particular weather conditions. However, for applications such as autonomous
driving, a unified model is necessary to perform restoration of corrupted
images due to different weather conditions. We propose a continual learning
approach to propose a unified framework for image restoration. The proposed
framework integrates three key innovations: (1) Selective Kernel Fusion layers
that dynamically combine global and local features for robust adaptive feature
selection; (2) Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to enable continual learning
and mitigate catastrophic forgetting across multiple restoration tasks; and (3)
a novel Cycle-Contrastive Loss that enhances feature discrimination while
preserving semantic consistency during domain translation. Further, we propose
an unpaired image restoration approach to reduce the dependance of the proposed
approach on the training data. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark
datasets for dehazing, desnowing and deraining tasks demonstrate significant
improvements in PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality over the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: This paper introduces VisHall3D, a novel two-stage framework for monocular
semantic scene completion that aims to address the issues of feature
entanglement and geometric inconsistency prevalent in existing methods.
VisHall3D decomposes the scene completion task into two stages: reconstructing
the visible regions (vision) and inferring the invisible regions
(hallucination). In the first stage, VisFrontierNet, a visibility-aware
projection module, is introduced to accurately trace the visual frontier while
preserving fine-grained details. In the second stage, OcclusionMAE, a
hallucination network, is employed to generate plausible geometries for the
invisible regions using a noise injection mechanism. By decoupling scene
completion into these two distinct stages, VisHall3D effectively mitigates
feature entanglement and geometric inconsistency, leading to significantly
improved reconstruction quality.
  The effectiveness of VisHall3D is validated through extensive experiments on
two challenging benchmarks: SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360. VisHall3D
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by a
significant margin and paves the way for more accurate and reliable scene
understanding in autonomous driving and other applications.

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆生成的点云数据中，只有部分数据对特定任务（如碰撞检测、交通分析）有用。现有方法在3D点云数据中物体计数不准确，导致查询结果误差大。

Method: 提出CounterNet，通过检测物体中心而非精确定位来提高计数准确性，采用特征图分区策略和动态模型选择策略。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，CounterNet将物体计数准确性提高了5%至20%，显著改善了查询结果的可靠性。

Conclusion: CounterNet有效解决了点云数据中物体计数不准确的问题，为查询任务提供了更可靠的基础。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles generate massive volumes of point cloud data, yet only a
subset is relevant for specific tasks such as collision detection, traffic
analysis, or congestion monitoring. Effectively querying this data is essential
to enable targeted analytics. In this work, we formalize point cloud querying
by defining three core query types: RETRIEVAL, COUNT, and AGGREGATION, each
aligned with distinct analytical scenarios. All these queries rely heavily on
accurate object counts to produce meaningful results, making precise object
counting a critical component of query execution. Prior work has focused on
indexing techniques for 2D video data, assuming detection models provide
accurate counting information. However, when applied to 3D point cloud data,
state-of-the-art detection models often fail to generate reliable object
counts, leading to substantial errors in query results. To address this
limitation, we propose CounterNet, a heatmap-based network designed for
accurate object counting in large-scale point cloud data. Rather than focusing
on accurate object localization, CounterNet detects object presence by finding
object centers to improve counting accuracy. We further enhance its performance
with a feature map partitioning strategy using overlapping regions, enabling
better handling of both small and large objects in complex traffic scenes. To
adapt to varying frame characteristics, we introduce a per-frame dynamic model
selection strategy that selects the most effective configuration for each
input. Evaluations on three real-world autonomous vehicle datasets show that
CounterNet improves counting accuracy by 5% to 20% across object categories,
resulting in more reliable query outcomes across all supported query types.

Conclusion: SPA-ADV和PRE-MAP为个性化视觉注意力建模提供了新方法，解决了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Visual selective attention, driven by individual preferences, regulates human
prioritization of visual stimuli by bridging subjective cognitive mechanisms
with objective visual elements, thereby steering the semantic interpretation
and hierarchical processing of dynamic visual scenes. However, existing models
and datasets predominantly neglect the influence of subjective cognitive
diversity on fixation behavior. Conventional saliency prediction models,
typically employing segmentation approaches, rely on low-resolution imagery to
generate saliency heatmaps, subsequently upscaled to native resolutions, which
limiting their capacity to capture personalized attention patterns.
Furthermore, MLLMs are constrained by factors such as hallucinations, making it
very costly to strictly adhere to the expected format in tasks involving
multiple point predictions, and achieving precise point positioning is
challenging. To address these limitations, we present Subjective Personalized
Attention for Advertisement Videos, namely SPA-ADV, a large-scale multimodal
dataset capturing gaze behaviors from over 4,500 participants varying in age
and gender with 486 videos. Furthermore, we propose PRE-MAP, a novel
eye-tracking saliency model that characterizes Personalized visual disparities
through Reinforcement learning-optimized Eye-tracking, built upon MLLMs and
guided by Multi-Attribute user profiles to predict Points. To ensure MLLMs
produce prediction points that are both format-correct and spatially accurate,
we introduce Consistency Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO), inspired
by the variability in eye movement points and Multi-Attribute profiles.
Extensive experiments on SPA-ADV and other benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. The code and dataset are available at

multi-agent behavior beyond the scale that was not considered before.
Specifically, our event generator formulates the temporal progression of a
dynamic scene into a sequence of small events. Each event calls for a
well-defined motion involving relevant characters and objects. Next, we
synthesize the motions of characters at positions sampled based on spatial
guidance. We employ a high-level module to deliver scalable yet comprehensive
context, translating events into relative descriptions that enable the
retrieval of precise coordinates. As the first to address this problem at scale
and with diversity, we offer a benchmark to assess diverse aspects of
contextual reasoning. Benchmark results and user studies show that our
framework effectively captures scene context with high scalability. The code

TL;DR: CoopTrack是一个端到端的协作跟踪框架，通过稀疏实例级特征传输提升感知能力，并在V2X-Seq数据集上取得最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单车辆自动驾驶系统的局限性，探索协作序列感知任务，如协作3D多目标跟踪。

Method: 提出CoopTrack框架，包括可学习的实例关联、多维特征提取和跨代理关联与聚合。

Result: 在V2X-Seq数据集上达到39.0% mAP和32.8% AMOTA，性能优异。

Conclusion: CoopTrack通过实例级特征传输和高效关联机制，显著提升了协作感知能力。

Abstract: Cooperative perception aims to address the inherent limitations of
single-vehicle autonomous driving systems through information exchange among
multiple agents. Previous research has primarily focused on single-frame
perception tasks. However, the more challenging cooperative sequential
perception tasks, such as cooperative 3D multi-object tracking, have not been
thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we propose CoopTrack, a fully
instance-level end-to-end framework for cooperative tracking, featuring
learnable instance association, which fundamentally differs from existing
approaches. CoopTrack transmits sparse instance-level features that
significantly enhance perception capabilities while maintaining low
transmission costs. Furthermore, the framework comprises two key components:
Multi-Dimensional Feature Extraction, and Cross-Agent Association and
Aggregation, which collectively enable comprehensive instance representation
with semantic and motion features, and adaptive cross-agent association and
fusion based on a feature graph. Experiments on both the V2X-Seq and Griffin
datasets demonstrate that CoopTrack achieves excellent performance.
Specifically, it attains state-of-the-art results on V2X-Seq, with 39.0\% mAP
and 32.8\% AMOTA. The project is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的多模态异常检测框架，通过分离深度和外观信息，生成丰富的异常样本，并在RGB和深度数据上共享参数，显著提升了3D异常检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业中3D深度异常检测仅依赖2D信息不足，且多模态信息差异导致现有方法难以充分表征3D信息，同时异常样本稀缺。

Method: 提取3D点云中的可见深度信息，用2D RGB图像表示外观；提出多尺度高斯异常生成器和统一纹理异常生成器；共享RGB和深度数据的参数。

Result: 在MVTec-3D AD和Eyecandies数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过统一框架和多模态参数共享，有效解决了3D异常检测中的信息表征和样本稀缺问题。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection for 2D objects has gained significant attention
and achieved progress in anomaly detection (AD) methods. However, identifying
3D depth anomalies using only 2D information is insufficient. Despite
explicitly fusing depth information into RGB images or using point cloud
backbone networks to extract depth features, both approaches struggle to
adequately represent 3D information in multimodal scenarios due to the
disparities among different modal information. Additionally, due to the
scarcity of abnormal samples in industrial data, especially in multimodal
scenarios, it is necessary to perform anomaly generation to simulate real-world
abnormal samples. Therefore, we propose a novel unified multimodal anomaly
detection framework to address these issues. Our contributions consist of 3 key
aspects. (1) We extract visible depth information from 3D point cloud data
simply and use 2D RGB images to represent appearance, which disentangles depth
and appearance to support unified anomaly generation. (2) Benefiting from the
flexible input representation, the proposed Multi-Scale Gaussian Anomaly
Generator and Unified Texture Anomaly Generator can generate richer anomalies
in RGB and depth. (3) All modules share parameters for both RGB and depth data,
effectively bridging 2D and 3D anomaly detection. Subsequent modules can
directly leverage features from both modalities without complex fusion.
Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVTec-3D AD
and Eyecandies datasets. Code available at:

TL;DR: OV-Fact是一种无需人工标注的方法，用于评估长描述的事实性，结合开放词汇视觉定位和工具验证，提升与人类判断的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型视觉语言模型在生成长且事实性描述时的困难，以及传统评估方法在长描述和缺乏人工标注时的不足。

Method: 利用开放词汇视觉定位和工具验证，设计无参考的评估方法，同时衡量描述性和事实精确性。

Result: OV-Fact在过滤大规模噪声预训练数据时，显著提升事实精确性而不牺牲描述性。

Conclusion: OV-Fact为长描述的事实性评估提供了新方法，并在数据过滤中表现出色。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate long and
factual captions. However, traditional measures for hallucination and
factuality are not well suited for evaluating longer, more diverse captions and
in settings where ground-truth human-annotated captions are unavailable. We
introduce OV-Fact, a novel method for measuring caption factuality of long
captions that leverages open-vocabulary visual grounding and tool-based
verification without depending on human annotations. Our method improves
agreement with human judgments and captures both caption descriptiveness
(recall) and factual precision in the same metric. Furthermore, unlike previous
metrics, our reference-free method design enables new applications towards
factuality-based data filtering. We observe models trained on an
OVFact-filtered (2.5-5x less) subset of a large-scale, noisy (VLM-generated)
pretraining set meaningfully improve factuality precision without sacrificing
caption descriptiveness across a range of downstream long caption benchmarks.

Motivation: 户外3D物体检测中，LiDAR和RGB数据的有效融合仍是一个开放性问题，需要更精确的模态整合方法。

Method: 设计了包含LiDAR-PillarNet、LiDAR-Height Compression和3D Multimodal三个流的多流网络，分别提取稀疏2D支柱特征、鸟瞰图特征及RGB与LiDAR的融合特征。

Result: 在KITTI基准测试中取得了新的最优或极具竞争力的结果，同时保持了高效性。

Conclusion: MuStD网络通过多模态特征融合显著提升了3D物体检测性能，代码将开源。

Abstract: Fusion of LiDAR and RGB data has the potential to enhance outdoor 3D object
detection accuracy. To address real-world challenges in outdoor 3D object
detection, fusion of LiDAR and RGB input has started gaining traction. However,
effective integration of these modalities for precise object detection task
still remains a largely open problem. To address that, we propose a MultiStream
Detection (MuStD) network, that meticulously extracts task-relevant information
from both data modalities. The network follows a three-stream structure. Its
LiDAR-PillarNet stream extracts sparse 2D pillar features from the LiDAR input
while the LiDAR-Height Compression stream computes Bird's-Eye View features. An
additional 3D Multimodal stream combines RGB and LiDAR features using UV
mapping and polar coordinate indexing. Eventually, the features containing
comprehensive spatial, textural and geometric information are carefully fused
and fed to a detection head for 3D object detection. Our extensive evaluation

establishes the efficacy of our method by achieving new state-of-the-art or
highly competitive results in different categories while remaining among the
most efficient methods. Our code will be released through MuStD GitHub

TL;DR: SimMLM是一个简单而强大的多模态学习框架，适用于模态缺失场景，通过动态混合模态专家（DMoME）和MoFe排序损失提升准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖复杂网络架构或数据填补技术，SimMLM旨在提供通用且高效的解决方案，适应各种模态缺失情况。

Method: 采用动态混合模态专家（DMoME）架构和MoFe排序损失，动态调整模态贡献，确保任务准确性随模态增加而提升或稳定。

Result: 在BraTS 2018、UPMC Food-101和avMNIST任务中，SimMLM表现优于竞争方法，准确性、鲁棒性和可靠性均更优。

Conclusion: SimMLM在多模态学习中表现出色，尤其在模态缺失场景下具有显著优势。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SimMLM, a simple yet powerful framework for
multimodal learning with missing modalities. Unlike existing approaches that
rely on sophisticated network architectures or complex data imputation
techniques, SimMLM provides a generic and effective solution that can adapt to
various missing modality scenarios with improved accuracy and robustness.
Specifically, SimMLM consists of a generic Dynamic Mixture of Modality Experts
(DMoME) architecture, featuring a dynamic, learnable gating mechanism that
automatically adjusts each modality's contribution in both full and partial
modality settings. A key innovation of SimMLM is the proposed More vs. Fewer
(MoFe) ranking loss, which ensures that task accuracy improves or remains
stable as more modalities are made available. This aligns the model with an
intuitive principle: removing one or more modalities should not increase
accuracy. We validate SimMLM on multimodal medical image segmentation (BraTS
2018) and multimodal classification (UPMC Food-101, avMNIST) tasks, where it
consistently surpasses competitive methods, demonstrating superior accuracy,
interpretability, robustness, and reliability across both complete and missing
modality scenarios at test time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在医疗影像和自动驾驶等高风险领域缺乏透明度，原型部分网络虽提供概念级解释，但现有方法要么限于细粒度任务，要么解释复杂。

Method: SIDE采用稀疏训练和修剪方案，结合sigmoid激活函数，使每个类别仅关联少量相关原型。

Result: 实验表明，SIDE在保持准确性的同时，将解释规模减少90%以上。

Conclusion: SIDE显著提升了原型解释的可理解性，适用于大规模数据集。

Abstract: Understanding the decisions made by deep neural networks is essential in
high-stakes domains such as medical imaging and autonomous driving. Yet, these
models often lack transparency, particularly in computer vision.
Prototypical-parts-based neural networks have emerged as a promising solution
by offering concept-level explanations. However, most are limited to
fine-grained classification tasks, with few exceptions such as InfoDisent.
InfoDisent extends prototypical models to large-scale datasets like ImageNet,
but produces complex explanations.
  We introduce Sparse Information Disentanglement for Explainability (SIDE), a
novel method that improves the interpretability of prototypical parts through a
dedicated training and pruning scheme that enforces sparsity. Combined with
sigmoid activations in place of softmax, this approach allows SIDE to associate
each class with only a small set of relevant prototypes. Extensive experiments
show that SIDE matches the accuracy of existing methods while reducing
explanation size by over $90\%$, substantially enhancing the understandability
of prototype-based explanations.

Motivation: 现有的自监督学习方法主要基于静态图像，忽略了视频中的时间线索，限制了模型对3D空间和时间的理解能力。

Method: 通过训练单图像编码器预测下一帧的表示，注入3D空间和时间先验，无需依赖光流或跟踪。

Result: 在ADE20K数据集上，mIoU从35.0提升到36.4，且模型可直接替换现有图像处理流程。

Conclusion: 视频自蒸馏是一种轻量级方法，能够增强几何感知能力，为物理AI和世界模型提供重要支持。

Abstract: Self-supervised image encoders such as DINO have recently gained significant
interest for learning robust visual features without labels. However, most SSL
methods train on static images and miss the temporal cues inherent in videos.
We introduce a video-distilled single-image encoder trained to predict the
next-frame representation from the current frame. This simple objective injects
3D spatial and temporal priors without optical flow or tracking. When
pre-training on a single 2-hour video, our approach raises the mean
Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) on ADE20K from 35.0 (DoRA) to 36.4 while
remaining a drop-in replacement for image-only pipelines. Our results highlight
video self-distillation as a lightweight route to geometry-aware perception an
essential ingredient for physically plausible world models and Physical AI.

Conclusion: RemoteReasoner为遥感推理任务提供了一种灵活且鲁棒的解决方案，超越了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Remote sensing imagery presents vast, inherently unstructured spatial data,
demanding sophisticated reasoning to interpret complex user intents and
contextual relationships beyond simple recognition tasks. In this paper, we aim
to construct an Earth observation workflow to handle complex queries by
reasoning about spatial context and user intent. As a reasoning workflow, it
should be somewhat autonomous, where predefined ground-truth reasoning paths do
not constrain the learning process. Furthermore, its architecture ought to be
unified yet flexible, enabling the model to perform diverse reasoning tasks
with distinct output formats through a single forward pass. Existing remote
sensing approaches fail to address these requirements, as they rely on
supervised fine-tuning paradigms that constrain the autonomy of reasoning. To
this end, we propose RemoteReasoner, a flexible and robust workflow for remote
sensing reasoning tasks. The design of RemoteReasoner integrates a multi-modal
large language model (MLLM) for interpreting user instructions and localizing
targets, together with task adaptation strategies that enable multi-granularity
output generation. In contrast to existing methods, our framework is trained
with reinforcement learning (RL) to endow the MLLM sufficient autonomy for
precise reasoning. At the inference stage, our adaptation strategies enable
diverse output formats at inference time without requiring task-specific
decoders or further fine-tuning. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that
RemoteReasoner achieves remarkable performance across multi-granularity
reasoning tasks, including region-level and pixel-level. Additionally, our
framework enables novel capabilities such as the contour extraction task beyond
the reach of existing reasoning pipelines.

Conclusion: PINO提供了一种无需训练的高效方法，实现了对群体互动的精确控制和逼真生成。

Abstract: Generating realistic group interactions involving multiple characters remains
challenging due to increasing complexity as group size expands. While existing
conditional diffusion models incrementally generate motions by conditioning on
previously generated characters, they rely on single shared prompts, limiting
nuanced control and leading to overly simplified interactions. In this paper,
we introduce Person-Interaction Noise Optimization (PINO), a novel,
training-free framework designed for generating realistic and customizable
interactions among groups of arbitrary size. PINO decomposes complex group
interactions into semantically relevant pairwise interactions, and leverages
pretrained two-person interaction diffusion models to incrementally compose
group interactions. To ensure physical plausibility and avoid common artifacts
such as overlapping or penetration between characters, PINO employs
physics-based penalties during noise optimization. This approach allows precise
user control over character orientation, speed, and spatial relationships
without additional training. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PINO
generates visually realistic, physically coherent, and adaptable multi-person
interactions suitable for diverse animation, gaming, and robotics applications.

Motivation: 手动血细胞检测耗时、低效且易出错，深度学习提供了一种可行的解决方案。

Method: 在YOLOX基础上引入CBAM和ASFF模块，并使用CIOU损失函数替代IOU。

Result: 在BCCD数据集上，ABCD方法达到95.49% mAP@0.5和86.89% mAP@0.5-0.9，分别比基线算法提高2.8%和23.41%，检测速度提升2.9%。

Conclusion: ABCD方法高效且适用于实时应用，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Detection of blood cells in microscopic images has become a major focus of
medical image analysis, playing a crucial role in gaining valuable insights
into a patient's health. Manual blood cell checks for disease detection are
known to be time-consuming, inefficient, and error-prone. To address these
limitations, analyzing blood cells using deep learning-based object detectors
can be regarded as a feasible solution. In this study, we propose automatic
blood cell detection method (ABCD) based on an improved version of YOLOX, an
object detector, for detecting various types of blood cells, including white
blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Firstly, we introduce the
Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) into the network's backbone to
enhance the efficiency of feature extraction. Furthermore, we introduce the
Adaptively Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF) into the network's neck, which
optimizes the fusion of different features extracted from various stages of the
network. Finally, to speed up the model's convergence, we substitute the
Intersection over Union (IOU) loss function with the Complete Intersection over
Union (CIOU) loss function. The experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method is more effective than other existing methods for BCCD dataset.
Compared to the baseline algorithm, our method ABCD achieved 95.49 % mAP@0.5
and 86.89 % mAP@0.5-0.9, which are 2.8% and 23.41% higher, respectively, and
increased the detection speed by 2.9%, making it highly efficient for real-time
applications.

Motivation: 解决V2V通信中传输原始点云或完整特征图导致的高延迟和可扩展性问题。

Method: 采用两阶段减少管道：选择性传输（ST）和自适应网格减少（AGR），结合软门控MoE注意力层进行特征融合。

Result: 在OPV2V基准测试中，EffiComm达到0.84 mAP@0.7，每帧仅传输约1.5 MB数据，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EffiComm展示了自适应学习通信在可扩展V2X感知中的价值。

Abstract: Collaborative perception allows connected vehicles to exchange sensor
information and overcome each vehicle's blind spots. Yet transmitting raw point
clouds or full feature maps overwhelms Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications,
causing latency and scalability problems. We introduce EffiComm, an end-to-end
framework that transmits less than 40% of the data required by prior art while
maintaining state-of-the-art 3D object detection accuracy. EffiComm operates on
Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) feature maps from any modality and applies a two-stage
reduction pipeline: (1) Selective Transmission (ST) prunes low-utility regions
with a confidence mask; (2) Adaptive Grid Reduction (AGR) uses a Graph Neural
Network (GNN) to assign vehicle-specific keep ratios according to role and
network load. The remaining features are fused with a soft-gated
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) attention layer, offering greater capacity and
specialization for effective feature integration. On the OPV2V benchmark,
EffiComm reaches 0.84 mAP@0.7 while sending only an average of approximately
1.5 MB per frame, outperforming previous methods on the accuracy-per-bit curve.
These results highlight the value of adaptive, learned communication for
scalable Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) perception.

Motivation: 胸部X光片在疾病诊断中至关重要，但临床数据的长尾分布导致现有自监督深度学习模型在罕见类别上表现不佳。

Method: 采用类加权机制，结合GMM聚类和Student t分布优化潜在空间分布，并通过度量损失调整嵌入。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR-JPG数据集的40个类别中，零样本AUC得分平均提升了7%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了长尾类别的识别准确性，为医学图像分类提供了更稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Chest radiography (CXR) plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of various
diseases. However, the inherent class imbalance in the distribution of clinical
findings presents a significant challenge for current self-supervised deep
learning models. These models often fail to accurately classify long-tailed
classes. Current Vision-Language models such as Contrastive Language Image
Pre-training (CLIP) models effectively model the manifold distribution of the
latent space, enabling high zero-shot classification accuracies. Although CLIP
performs well on most of the primary classes in the dataset, our work reveals
that its effectiveness decreases significantly for classes with a long-tailed
distribution. Our approach employs a class-weighting mechanism that directly
aligns with the distribution of classes within the latent space. This method
ensures a substantial improvement in overall classification performance, with
particular emphasis on enhancing the recognition and accuracy of rarely
observed classes. We accomplish this by applying Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
clustering to the latent space. The subsequent clusters are further refined by
Student t-distribution, followed by a metric loss that utilizes the altered
embeddings. Our approach facilitates stable and adaptive clustering of the
features. This results in a notable average improvement of 7\% points in
zero-shot AUC scores across 40 classes in the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset from
previous SOTA models.

Abstract: Creating a virtual avatar with semantically coherent gestures that are
aligned with speech is a challenging task. Existing gesture generation research
mainly focused on generating rhythmic beat gestures, neglecting the semantic
context of the gestures. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for
semantic grounding in co-speech gesture generation that integrates semantic
information at both fine-grained and global levels. Our approach starts with
learning the motion prior through a vector-quantized variational autoencoder.
Built on this model, a second-stage module is applied to automatically generate
gestures from speech, text-based semantics and speaker identity that ensures
consistency between the semantic relevance of generated gestures and
co-occurring speech semantics through semantic coherence and relevance modules.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enhances the realism and
coherence of semantic gestures. Extensive experiments and user studies show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across two benchmarks
in co-speech gesture generation in both objective and subjective metrics. The
qualitative results of our model, code, dataset and pre-trained models can be

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了EA-ViT的有效性和多功能性。

Conclusion: EA-ViT为ViT的灵活部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a foundational model in computer
vision, excelling in generalization and adaptation to downstream tasks.
However, deploying ViTs to support diverse resource constraints typically
requires retraining multiple, size-specific ViTs, which is both time-consuming
and energy-intensive. To address this issue, we propose an efficient ViT
adaptation framework that enables a single adaptation process to generate
multiple models of varying sizes for deployment on platforms with various
resource constraints. Our approach comprises two stages. In the first stage, we
enhance a pre-trained ViT with a nested elastic architecture that enables
structural flexibility across MLP expansion ratio, number of attention heads,
embedding dimension, and network depth. To preserve pre-trained knowledge and
ensure stable adaptation, we adopt a curriculum-based training strategy that
progressively increases elasticity. In the second stage, we design a
lightweight router to select submodels according to computational budgets and
downstream task demands. Initialized with Pareto-optimal configurations derived
via a customized NSGA-II algorithm, the router is then jointly optimized with
the backbone. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and versatility of EA-ViT. The code is available at
https://github.com/zcxcf/EA-ViT.

Motivation: 提升自动驾驶决策系统的可解释性和透明度，增强安全性和人机交互。

Method: 利用BEVFusion结合3D LiDAR点云和多视角图像，引入绝对位置编码。

Result: 在nuCaption数据集上表现优异，BLEU分数提升5%，并发布两个新数据集nuView和GroundView。

Conclusion: BEV-LLM在性能和数据集方面为自动驾驶场景描述提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous driving technology has the potential to transform transportation,
but its wide adoption depends on the development of interpretable and
transparent decision-making systems. Scene captioning, which generates natural
language descriptions of the driving environment, plays a crucial role in
enhancing transparency, safety, and human-AI interaction. We introduce BEV-LLM,
a lightweight model for 3D captioning of autonomous driving scenes. BEV-LLM
leverages BEVFusion to combine 3D LiDAR point clouds and multi-view images,
incorporating a novel absolute positional encoding for view-specific scene
descriptions. Despite using a small 1B parameter base model, BEV-LLM achieves
competitive performance on the nuCaption dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art
by up to 5\% in BLEU scores. Additionally, we release two new datasets - nuView
(focused on environmental conditions and viewpoints) and GroundView (focused on
object grounding) - to better assess scene captioning across diverse driving
scenarios and address gaps in current benchmarks, along with initial
benchmarking results demonstrating their effectiveness.

Result: MAELRE在跨模态分类任务中表现出更高的准确性，同时降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: MAELRE为长上下文处理提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，适用于多种模态。

Abstract: The long-context capability of recent large transformer models can be
surmised to rely on techniques such as attention/model parallelism, as well as
hardware-level optimizations. While these strategies allow input lengths to
scale to millions of tokens, they do not fundamentally mitigate the quadratic
computational and memory complexity of the core attention mechanism. In this
paper, we address the challenge of long-context processing on a single device
using generic implementations by reducing the quadratic memory footprint and
inference cost. Existing approaches to extend the context length for generic
single device implementations -- such as token merging and modified attentions
-- are often modality specific and attain a suboptimal tradeoff between
accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose MAELRE
(Modality Agnostic Efficient Long Range Encoder), a unified and efficient
transformer architecture designed for long-range encoding across diverse
modalities. MAELRE integrates token merging with attention approximation,
progressively merging tokens at different stages of internal computational
blocks. It employs a lightweight attention approximation when the number of
tokens is large, and switches to standard dot-product attention as the sequence
becomes shorter through successive aggregation. We demonstrate that MAELRE
achieves superior accuracy while reducing computational cost compared to
existing long-context models on classification tasks spanning multiple
modalities, including text, time series, audio, and vision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BIQA方法因集成不足和缺乏灵活的不确定性估计而表现不佳，DEFNet旨在解决这些问题。

Result: 在合成和真实失真数据集上的实验表明，DEFNet具有高效性和鲁棒性，且具备良好的泛化能力和适应性。

Conclusion: DEFNet通过多任务优化和不确定性估计，显著提升了BIQA的性能，适用于未知场景。

Abstract: Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) methods often incorporate auxiliary
tasks to improve performance. However, existing approaches face limitations due
to insufficient integration and a lack of flexible uncertainty estimation,
leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose a
multitasks-based Deep Evidential Fusion Network (DEFNet) for BIQA, which
performs multitask optimization with the assistance of scene and distortion
type classification tasks. To achieve a more robust and reliable
representation, we design a novel trustworthy information fusion strategy. It
first combines diverse features and patterns across sub-regions to enhance
information richness, and then performs local-global information fusion by
balancing fine-grained details with coarse-grained context. Moreover, DEFNet
exploits advanced uncertainty estimation technique inspired by evidential
learning with the help of normal-inverse gamma distribution mixture. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and authentic distortion datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Additional evaluation
and analysis are carried out to highlight its strong generalization capability
and adaptability to previously unseen scenarios.

Motivation: 当前对LVLMs中时空理解的内在推理机制缺乏深入研究，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了三个电路（视觉审计电路、语义追踪电路和注意力流电路）来系统分析LVLMs中的时空语义处理。

Result: 发现视觉语义集中在特定对象标记上，移除这些标记会降低模型性能达92.6%；中后期层对时空语义表现出功能局部化。

Conclusion: 研究为LVLMs的时空语义分析提供了机制性见解，为设计更鲁棒和可解释的模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: The processing mechanisms underlying language and image understanding in
large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been extensively studied. However,
the internal reasoning mechanisms of LVLMs for spatiotemporal understanding
remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a systematic,
circuit-based framework designed to investigate how spatiotemporal visual
semantics are represented and processed within these LVLMs. Specifically, our
framework comprises three circuits: visual auditing circuit, semantic tracing
circuit, and attention flow circuit. Through the lens of these circuits, we
discover that visual semantics are highly localized to specific object
tokens--removing these tokens can degrade model performance by up to 92.6%.
Furthermore, we identify that interpretable concepts of objects and actions
emerge and become progressively refined in the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs.
In contrary to the current works that solely focus on objects in one image, we
reveal that the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs exhibit specialized functional
localization for spatiotemporal semantics. Our findings offer significant
mechanistic insights into spatiotemporal semantics analysis of LVLMs, laying a
foundation for designing more robust and interpretable models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖LiDAR标注，限制了可扩展性，无法利用大量众包数据进行自动标注。

Method: GS-Occ3D使用Octree高斯曲面优化显式占用表示，并将场景分解为静态背景、地面和动态物体进行建模。

Result: 在Waymo数据集上实现了最先进的几何重建效果，并在Occ3D-Waymo和Occ3D-nuScenes上展示了优越的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: GS-Occ3D展示了基于视觉的大规模占用空间重建作为自动驾驶感知新范式的潜力。

Abstract: Occupancy is crucial for autonomous driving, providing essential geometric
priors for perception and planning. However, existing methods predominantly
rely on LiDAR-based occupancy annotations, which limits scalability and
prevents leveraging vast amounts of potential crowdsourced data for
auto-labeling. To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only
framework that directly reconstructs occupancy. Vision-only occupancy
reconstruction poses significant challenges due to sparse viewpoints, dynamic
scene elements, severe occlusions, and long-horizon motion. Existing
vision-based methods primarily rely on mesh representation, which suffer from
incomplete geometry and additional post-processing, limiting scalability. To
overcome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation
using an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and
scalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground,
and dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is
explicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly
improving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled
to better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on
the Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry
reconstruction results. By curating vision-only binary occupancy labels from
diverse urban scenes, we show their effectiveness for downstream occupancy
models on Occ3D-Waymo and superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes.
It highlights the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy
reconstruction as a new paradigm for autonomous driving perception. Project

Result: 即使姿态估计不完美，仍能学习高保真3D表示，显著减少训练成本。

Conclusion: 该方法为空间应用中的新视角合成提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The advent of novel view synthesis techniques such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has enabled learning precise 3D models only from posed
monocular images. Although these methods are attractive, they hold two major
limitations that prevent their use in space applications: they require poses
during training, and have high computational cost at training and inference. To
address these limitations, this work contributes: (1) a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) based primitive initializer for 3DGS using monocular images; (2)
a pipeline capable of training with noisy or implicit pose estimates; and (3)
and analysis of initialization variants that reduce the training cost of
precise 3D models. A CNN takes a single image as input and outputs a coarse 3D
model represented as an assembly of primitives, along with the target's pose
relative to the camera. This assembly of primitives is then used to initialize
3DGS, significantly reducing the number of training iterations and input images
needed -- by at least an order of magnitude. For additional flexibility, the
CNN component has multiple variants with different pose estimation techniques.
This work performs a comparison between these variants, evaluating their
effectiveness for downstream 3DGS training under noisy or implicit pose
estimates. The results demonstrate that even with imperfect pose supervision,
the pipeline is able to learn high-fidelity 3D representations, opening the
door for the use of novel view synthesis in space applications.

action-conditioned world model can be used for planning by simulating candidate
trajectories in latent space.

Abstract: We present a universal prior model for 3D head avatars with explicit hair
compositionality. Existing approaches to build generalizable priors for 3D head
avatars often adopt a holistic modeling approach, treating the face and hair as
an inseparable entity. This overlooks the inherent compositionality of the
human head, making it difficult for the model to naturally disentangle face and
hair representations, especially when the dataset is limited. Furthermore, such
holistic models struggle to support applications like 3D face and hairstyle
swapping in a flexible and controllable manner. To address these challenges, we
introduce a prior model that explicitly accounts for the compositionality of
face and hair, learning their latent spaces separately. A key enabler of this
approach is our synthetic hairless data creation pipeline, which removes hair
from studio-captured datasets using estimated hairless geometry and texture
derived from a diffusion prior. By leveraging a paired dataset of hair and
hairless captures, we train disentangled prior models for face and hair,
incorporating compositionality as an inductive bias to facilitate effective
separation. Our model's inherent compositionality enables seamless transfer of
face and hair components between avatars while preserving identity.
Additionally, we demonstrate that our model can be fine-tuned in a few-shot
manner using monocular captures to create high-fidelity, hair-compositional 3D
head avatars for unseen subjects. These capabilities highlight the practical
applicability of our approach in real-world scenarios, paving the way for
flexible and expressive 3D avatar generation.

Result: 该框架能够自动化服务组合，实现从意图到执行的无缝衔接。

Conclusion: LRM-LAM集成框架为服务组合的自动化和用户友好性提供了新方向。

Abstract: Service composition remains a central challenge in building adaptive and
intelligent software systems, often constrained by limited reasoning
capabilities or brittle execution mechanisms. This paper explores the
integration of two emerging paradigms enabled by large language models: Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) and Large Action Models (LAMs). We argue that LRMs
address the challenges of semantic reasoning and ecosystem complexity while
LAMs excel in dynamic action execution and system interoperability. However,
each paradigm has complementary limitations - LRMs lack grounded action
capabilities, and LAMs often struggle with deep reasoning. We propose an
integrated LRM-LAM architectural framework as a promising direction for
advancing automated service composition. Such a system can reason about service
requirements and constraints while dynamically executing workflows, thus
bridging the gap between intention and execution. This integration has the
potential to transform service composition into a fully automated,
user-friendly process driven by high-level natural language intent.

Abstract: This study focuses on the development of a simulation-driven reinforcement

Dyna-style planning (Dyna-DDPG). The framework includes a flexible and
configurable simulation environment capable of modeling diverse queueing
scenarios, disruptions, and unpredictable conditions. Our enhanced Dyna-DDPG
implementation incorporates separate predictive models for next-state
transitions and rewards, significantly improving stability and sample
efficiency. Comprehensive experiments and rigorous evaluations demonstrate the
framework's capability to rapidly learn effective routing policies that
maintain robust performance under disruptions and scale effectively to larger

employed to ensure reproducibility and maintainability of the framework,
enabling practical deployment in real-world scenarios.

Result: 在SCAN基准测试中达到>99%的准确率，仅需1.19M参数。

Conclusion: MIRAGE的系统性依赖于模式提取质量和迭代优化过程。

Abstract: Systematic compositional generalization - constructing and understanding
novel combinations of known building blocks - remains a core challenge for AI
systems. Human cognition achieves this flexibility via the interplay of the
hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC): the hippocampus rapidly encodes
episodes, and the prefrontal cortex consolidates them into reusable schemas for
reasoning. Drawing on these insights, we present MIRAGE (Meta-Inference with
Rules and Abstractions from Generalized Experience), a framework that achieves
systematic generalization on compositional tasks. MIRAGE has two interacting
modules mirroring the brain's deliberative HPC-PFC loop and intuitive
neocortical pattern recognition. (1) The meta-trained Transformer Neural
Decomposer, paralleling neocortical "System 1" computation, is trained on a
task-agnostic stream of randomly sampled compositional grammars and applies one
decomposition step per pass, with successive passes iteratively refining the
sequence representation. (2) The Schema Engine, analogous to the HPC-PFC
"System 2" loop, dynamically extracts, ranks, and applies reusable schemas,
storing variable bindings in episodic memory and expanding them when needed. By
explicitly equipping the Transformer component of MIRAGE with actively managed
schematic structures, our model performs systematic compositional operations
through explicit schema application and transformation, relying solely on
frozen weights when solving entirely novel tasks. This approach demonstrates
systematic compositional generalization on the SCAN benchmark, achieving > 99%
accuracy on all task splits with only 1.19M parameters in the transformer
module. Ablation studies confirm that MIRAGE's systematicity critically depends
on the quality of extracted schemas and the model's iterative refinement
process.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to robotic control, but
effective policy learning under partial observability remains a major
challenge, especially in high-dimensional tasks like humanoid locomotion. To
date, no prior work has demonstrated stable training of humanoid policies with
incomplete state information in the benchmark Gymnasium Humanoid-v4
environment. The objective in this environment is to walk forward as fast as
possible without falling, with rewards provided for staying upright and moving
forward, and penalties incurred for excessive actions and external contact
forces. This research presents the first successful instance of learning under
partial observability in this environment. The learned policy achieves
performance comparable to state-of-the-art results with full state access,
despite using only one-third to two-thirds of the original states. Moreover,
the policy exhibits adaptability to robot properties, such as variations in
body part masses. The key to this success is a novel history encoder that
processes a fixed-length sequence of past observations in parallel. Integrated
into a standard model-free algorithm, the encoder enables performance on par
with fully observed baselines. We hypothesize that it reconstructs essential
contextual information from recent observations, thereby enabling robust
decision-making.

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解灾难性遗忘，提升TKG补全模型的鲁棒性，特别适合增量训练场景。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) completion models traditionally assume access
to the entire graph during training. This overlooks challenges stemming from
the evolving nature of TKGs, such as: (i) the model's requirement to generalize
and assimilate new knowledge, and (ii) the task of managing new or unseen
entities that often have sparse connections. In this paper, we present an
incremental training framework specifically designed for TKGs, aiming to
address entities that are either not observed during training or have sparse
connections. Our approach combines a model-agnostic enhancement layer with a
weighted sampling strategy, that can be augmented to and improve any existing
TKG completion method. The enhancement layer leverages a broader, global
definition of entity similarity, which moves beyond mere local neighborhood
proximity of GNN-based methods. The weighted sampling strategy employed in
training accentuates edges linked to infrequently occurring entities. We
evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that our
framework outperforms existing methods in total link prediction, inductive link
prediction, and in addressing long-tail entities. Notably, our method achieves
a 10\% improvement and a 15\% boost in MRR for these datasets. The results
underscore the potential of our approach in mitigating catastrophic forgetting
and enhancing the robustness of TKG completion methods, especially in an
incremental training context

Abstract: Fine-grained traffic management and prediction are fundamental to key
applications such as autonomous driving, lane change guidance, and traffic
signal control. However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a
critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and
number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To
address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task,

solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first
scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a
two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task.
This framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the
Lane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies
and distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained
lane traffic states. Based on existing research, we designed several baseline
models with the potential to solve the FRTI task and conducted extensive
experiments on six datasets representing different road conditions to validate
the effectiveness of the RoadDiff model in addressing the FRTI task. The

*Noé Lallouet,Tristan Cazenave,Cyrille Enderli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Pareto-NRPA是一种新的蒙特卡洛算法，用于离散搜索空间中的多目标优化问题，扩展了单目标问题的NRPA算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将NRPA算法扩展到多目标优化问题，以解决现有算法在收敛性和多样性上的不足。

Method: 使用一组策略并行探索解空间的不同区域，并在搜索的每个层级维护非支配前沿。策略更新基于Pareto前沿中序列的多样性和隔离性。

Result: 在MO-TSPTW和神经网络架构搜索任务上，Pareto-NRPA表现优于现有算法，尤其在受限搜索空间中。

Conclusion: Pareto-NRPA是NRPA算法在多目标优化中的首次成功扩展，具有竞争性的性能。

Abstract: We introduce Pareto-NRPA, a new Monte-Carlo algorithm designed for
multi-objective optimization problems over discrete search spaces. Extending
the Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation (NRPA) algorithm originally formulated for
single-objective problems, Pareto-NRPA generalizes the nested search and policy
update mechanism to multi-objective optimization. The algorithm uses a set of
policies to concurrently explore different regions of the solution space and
maintains non-dominated fronts at each level of search. Policy adaptation is
performed with respect to the diversity and isolation of sequences within the
Pareto front. We benchmark Pareto-NRPA on two classes of problems: a novel
bi-objective variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows
problem (MO-TSPTW), and a neural architecture search task on well-known
benchmarks. Results demonstrate that Pareto-NRPA achieves competitive
performance against state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms, both in terms
of convergence and diversity of solutions. Particularly, Pareto-NRPA strongly
outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary multi-objective algorithms on
constrained search spaces. To our knowledge, this work constitutes the first
adaptation of NRPA to the multi-objective setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准未能考虑任务异质性和代理能力与实际用户需求的匹配，阻碍了能力开发和实际部署。

Method: 提出OS-MAP基准，包含416个任务，按自动化五级分类和需求层次结构评估代理能力。

Result: 实验显示，即使最先进的代理在涉及感知、推理和协调的高层次任务中表现不佳。

Conclusion: OS-MAP为计算机代理的研究和部署提供了结构化评估框架，揭示了当前技术的局限性。

Abstract: Computer-using agents have shown strong potential to boost human productivity
and enable new application forms across platforms. While recent advances have
led to usable applications, existing benchmarks fail to account for the
internal task heterogeneity and the corresponding agent capabilities, as well
as their alignment with actual user demands-hindering both targeted capability
development and the reliable transition of research progress into practical
deployment. To bridge the gap, we present OS-MAP, a benchmark for daily
computer-using automation that organizes its 416 realistic tasks across 15
applications along two key dimensions: a five-level taxonomy of automation and
a generalization scope derived from a real-world user demand hierarchy. To
enable fine-grained analysis of required capabilities and alignment with
real-world scenarios, OS-MAP evaluates agents along two dimensions: automation
level across a five-level taxonomy, and generalization scope across a demand
hierarchy. This design captures varying levels of required agent autonomy and
generalization, forming a performance-generalization evaluation matrix for
structured and comprehensive assessment. Experiments show that even
State-of-the-Art agents with VLM backbones struggle with higher-level tasks
involving perception, reasoning, and coordination-highlighting the need for a
deeper understanding of current strengths and limitations to drive the future
progress in computer-using agents research and deployment. All code,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有远程生理监测数据集规模小、多样性不足，无法反映真实驾驶场景的挑战，因此需要更全面的数据集。

Result: 数据集覆盖了多种驾驶条件，评估了信号处理和深度学习方法，并提供了开源代码。

Conclusion: PhysDrive将成为多模态驾驶员监测和智能座舱系统研究的基础资源。

Abstract: Robust and unobtrusive in-vehicle physiological monitoring is crucial for
ensuring driving safety and user experience. While remote physiological
measurement (RPM) offers a promising non-invasive solution, its translation to
real-world driving scenarios is critically constrained by the scarcity of
comprehensive datasets. Existing resources are often limited in scale, modality
diversity, the breadth of biometric annotations, and the range of captured
conditions, thereby omitting inherent real-world challenges in driving. Here,
we present PhysDrive, the first large-scale multimodal dataset for contactless
in-vehicle physiological sensing with dedicated consideration on various
modality settings and driving factors. PhysDrive collects data from 48 drivers,
including synchronized RGB, near-infrared camera, and raw mmWave radar data,
accompanied with six synchronized ground truths (ECG, BVP, Respiration, HR, RR,
and SpO2). It covers a wide spectrum of naturalistic driving conditions,
including driver motions, dynamic natural light, vehicle types, and road
conditions. We extensively evaluate both signal-processing and deep-learning
methods on PhysDrive, establishing a comprehensive benchmark across all
modalities, and release full open-source code with compatibility for mainstream
public toolboxes. We envision PhysDrive will serve as a foundational resource
and accelerate research on multimodal driver monitoring and smart-cockpit
systems.

Result: 实验表明，该算法在推理任务和组合数学问题上实现了数量级的加速。

Conclusion: 新算法显著提升了有序域上推理的效率，尤其是在处理前驱关系时表现出色。

Abstract: We investigate lifted inference on ordered domains with predecessor
relations, where the elements of the domain respect a total (cyclic) order, and
every element has a distinct (clockwise) predecessor. Previous work has
explored this problem through weighted first-order model counting (WFOMC),
which computes the weighted sum of models for a given first-order logic
sentence over a finite domain. In WFOMC, the order constraint is typically
encoded by the linear order axiom introducing a binary predicate in the
sentence to impose a linear ordering on the domain elements. The immediate and
second predecessor relations are then encoded by the linear order predicate.
Although WFOMC with the linear order axiom is theoretically tractable, existing
algorithms struggle with practical applications, particularly when the
predecessor relations are involved. In this paper, we treat predecessor
relations as a native part of the axiom and devise a novel algorithm that
inherently supports these relations. The proposed algorithm not only provides
an exponential speedup for the immediate and second predecessor relations,
which are known to be tractable, but also handles the general k-th predecessor
relations. The extensive experiments on lifted inference tasks and
combinatorics math problems demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm,
achieving speedups of a full order of magnitude.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI模型在资源受限环境中部署时面临的计算资源不足问题。

Method: 采用知识嫁接机制，将大型模型（供体）的选定特征移植到小型模型（砧木）中。

Result: 模型大小减少了88.54%，验证准确率提升至89.97%，测试准确率达90.45%。

Conclusion: 知识嫁接方法在资源受限设备上实现了高性能AI部署，适用于边缘计算场景。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to larger,
more complex models with numerous parameters that require substantial computing
power -- resources often unavailable in many real-world application scenarios.
Our paper addresses this challenge by introducing knowledge grafting, a novel
mechanism that optimizes AI models for resource-constrained environments by
transferring selected features (the scion) from a large donor model to a
smaller rootstock model. The approach achieves an 88.54% reduction in model
size (from 64.39 MB to 7.38 MB), while improving generalization capability of
the model. Our new rootstock model achieves 89.97% validation accuracy (vs.
donor's 87.47%), maintains lower validation loss (0.2976 vs. 0.5068), and
performs exceptionally well on unseen test data with 90.45% accuracy. It
addresses the typical size vs performance trade-off, and enables deployment of
AI frameworks on resource-constrained devices with enhanced performance. We
have tested our approach on an agricultural weed detection scenario, however,
it can be extended across various edge computing scenarios, potentially
accelerating AI adoption in areas with limited hardware/software support -- by
mirroring in a similar manner the horticultural grafting enables productive
cultivation in challenging agri-based environments.

TL;DR: 论文研究了在隐藏棋子身份的游戏中，基于约束的信念表示与概率推断的信念表示对代理性能的影响，发现两者效果相近。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不完全信息游戏中代理需基于部分知识做决策的挑战，通过游戏模型本身处理状态估计。

Method: 提出两种信念表示方法：基于约束的模型（CSP）和概率扩展模型（Belief Propagation），并在两种游戏中评估。

Result: 约束基信念与概率推断效果相当，代理性能差异微小。

Conclusion: 约束基信念在许多场景下足以支持有效决策。

Abstract: In imperfect-information games, agents must make decisions based on partial
knowledge of the game state. The Belief Stochastic Game model addresses this
challenge by delegating state estimation to the game model itself. This allows
agents to operate on externally provided belief states, thereby reducing the
need for game-specific inference logic. This paper investigates two approaches
to represent beliefs in games with hidden piece identities: a constraint-based
model using Constraint Satisfaction Problems and a probabilistic extension
using Belief Propagation to estimate marginal probabilities. We evaluated the
impact of both representations using general-purpose agents across two
different games. Our findings indicate that constraint-based beliefs yield
results comparable to those of probabilistic inference, with minimal
differences in agent performance. This suggests that constraint-based belief
states alone may suffice for effective decision-making in many settings.

Motivation: 从计算社会科学的角度，研究LLMs在模拟人类认知和社会行为中的能力与不足，以推动更有效的模拟工具发展。

Method: 分为三部分：1）评估LLMs在人类认知和社会推理中的表现；2）调查LLMs在多智能体模拟中的应用；3）区分LLMs适用与不适用场景，提出混合方法。

Result: LLMs在交互模拟中表现良好，但在解释性或预测性建模中存在局限性；混合方法可结合其灵活性与传统系统的严谨性。

Conclusion: 建议将LLMs与传统建模平台结合，以平衡灵活性与透明度，提升社会模拟的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: This position paper examines the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
social simulation, analyzing both their potential and their limitations from a
computational social science perspective. The first part reviews recent
findings on the ability of LLMs to replicate key aspects of human cognition,
including Theory of Mind reasoning and social inference, while also
highlighting significant limitations such as cognitive biases, lack of true
understanding, and inconsistencies in behavior. The second part surveys
emerging applications of LLMs in multi-agent simulation frameworks, focusing on
system architectures, scale, and validation strategies. Notable projects such
as Generative Agents (Smallville) and AgentSociety are discussed in terms of
their design choices, empirical grounding, and methodological innovations.
Particular attention is given to the challenges of behavioral fidelity,
calibration, and reproducibility in large-scale LLM-driven simulations. The
final section distinguishes between contexts where LLMs, like other black-box
systems, offer direct value-such as interactive simulations and serious
games-and those where their use is more problematic, notably in explanatory or
predictive modeling. The paper concludes by advocating for hybrid approaches
that integrate LLMs into traditional agent-based modeling platforms (GAMA,
Netlogo, etc), enabling modelers to combine the expressive flexibility of
language-based reasoning with the transparency and analytical rigor of
classical rule-based systems.

Abstract: Building neural systems that can learn to execute symbolic algorithms is a
challenging open problem in artificial intelligence, especially when aiming for
strong generalization and out-of-distribution performance. In this work, we
introduce a general framework for learning convergent term rewriting systems
using a neuro-symbolic architecture inspired by the rewriting algorithm itself.
We present two modular implementations of such architecture: the Neural
Rewriting System (NRS) and the Fast Neural Rewriting System (FastNRS). As a
result of algorithmic-inspired design and key architectural elements, both
models can generalize to out-of-distribution instances, with FastNRS offering
significant improvements in terms of memory efficiency, training speed, and
inference time. We evaluate both architectures on four tasks involving the
simplification of mathematical formulas and further demonstrate their
versatility in a multi-domain learning scenario, where a single model is
trained to solve multiple types of problems simultaneously. The proposed system
significantly outperforms two strong neural baselines: the Neural Data Router,
a recent transformer variant specifically designed to solve algorithmic
problems, and GPT-4o, one of the most powerful general-purpose large-language
models. Moreover, our system matches or outperforms the latest o1-preview model
from OpenAI that excels in reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Budget planning and maintenance optimization are crucial for infrastructure
asset management, ensuring cost-effectiveness and sustainability. However, the
complexity arising from combinatorial action spaces, diverse asset
deterioration, stringent budget constraints, and environmental uncertainty
significantly limits existing methods' scalability. This paper proposes a
Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning methodology specifically tailored to
multi-year infrastructure planning. Our approach decomposes the problem into
two hierarchical levels: a high-level Budget Planner allocating annual budgets
within explicit feasibility bounds, and a low-level Maintenance Planner
prioritizing assets within the allocated budget. By structurally separating
macro-budget decisions from asset-level prioritization and integrating linear
programming projection within a hierarchical Soft Actor-Critic framework, the
method efficiently addresses exponential growth in the action space and ensures
rigorous budget compliance. A case study evaluating sewer networks of varying
sizes (10, 15, and 20 sewersheds) illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed
approach. Compared to conventional Deep Q-Learning and enhanced genetic
algorithms, our methodology converges more rapidly, scales effectively, and
consistently delivers near-optimal solutions even as network size grows.

Conclusion: 该框架具有通用性、高效性，并能显式处理测量噪声，适用于多种逆问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful tools for sampling from high-dimensional
distributions by progressively transforming pure noise into structured data
through a denoising process. When equipped with a guidance mechanism, these
models can also generate samples from conditional distributions. In this paper,
a novel diffusion-based framework is introduced for solving inverse problems
using a piecewise guidance scheme. The guidance term is defined as a piecewise
function of the diffusion timestep, facilitating the use of different
approximations during high-noise and low-noise phases. This design is shown to
effectively balance computational efficiency with the accuracy of the guidance
term. Unlike task-specific approaches that require retraining for each problem,
the proposed method is problem-agnostic and readily adaptable to a variety of
inverse problems. Additionally, it explicitly incorporates measurement noise
into the reconstruction process. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is
demonstrated through extensive experiments on image restoration tasks,
specifically image inpainting and super-resolution. Using a class conditional
diffusion model for recovery, compared to the \pgdm baseline, the proposed
framework achieves a reduction in inference time of \(25\%\) for inpainting
with both random and center masks, and \(23\%\) and \(24\%\) for \(4\times\)
and \(8\times\) super-resolution tasks, respectively, while incurring only
negligible loss in PSNR and SSIM.

Abstract: The rise of online learning has led to the development of various knowledge
tracing (KT) methods. However, existing methods have overlooked the problem of
increasing computational cost when utilizing large graphs and long learning
sequences. To address this issue, we introduce Dual Graph Attention-based
Knowledge Tracing (DGAKT), a graph neural network model designed to leverage
high-order information from subgraphs representing student-exercise-KC
relationships. DGAKT incorporates a subgraph-based approach to enhance
computational efficiency. By processing only relevant subgraphs for each target
interaction, DGAKT significantly reduces memory and computational requirements
compared to full global graph models. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that DGAKT not only outperforms existing KT models but also sets a
new standard in resource efficiency, addressing a critical need that has been
largely overlooked by prior KT approaches.

Abstract: A large language model (LLM) with knowledge in both scientific and general
tasks is the foundation of science general intelligence. However, directly
continued pretraining an LLM using science data usually leads to catastrophic
forgetting, which indicates severe degradation in general ability. In this
report, we present Innovator, which solves this problem by upcycling a
pre-trained dense LLM into a fine-grained Mixtures-of-Experts model during
continued pretraining, where different experts are expected to learn science
knowledge in different disciplines, and a shared expert is utilized for general
tasks. Innovator introduces a four-stage upcycle training paradigm: (1)
Scientific Expert Induction on discipline-specific data, (2) Fine-grained
Expert Splitting via FFN dimension decomposition, (3) Science-Aware Routing
warmup, and (4) Generalist-Scientist Integration training on hybrid datasets.
Such a paradigm enables knowledge in the general domain, and different
scientific disciplines can be decoupled, avoiding the negative influence among
knowledge in different domains. With 53.3B total parameters and 13.3B
activated, Innovator extends Qwen2.5-7B using a shared general expert and 64
specialized scientific experts with 8 activated. Trained on 300B tokens with
tri-level quality-controlled data, Innovator achieves 25% average improvement
across 30 scientific tasks with a win rate as 70%, while retaining 99%
performance in general tasks. Furthermore, Innovator-Reason, which is
post-trained from Innovator for reasoning boosting, exhibits excellent
reasoning performance in solving complex scientific problems with improvements
over 30%.

Abstract: This thesis presents the results of a comprehensive research project focused
on applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to the problem of market making in
financial markets. Market makers (MMs) play a fundamental role in providing
liquidity, yet face significant challenges arising from inventory risk,
competition, and non-stationary market dynamics. This research explores how RL,
particularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), can be employed to develop
autonomous, adaptive, and profitable market making strategies.
  The study begins by formulating the MM task as a reinforcement learning
problem, designing agents capable of operating in both single-agent and
multi-agent settings within a simulated financial environment. It then
addresses the complex issue of inventory management using two complementary
approaches: reward engineering and Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning
(MORL). While the former uses dynamic reward shaping to guide behavior, the
latter leverages Pareto front optimization to explicitly balance competing
objectives.
  To address the problem of non-stationarity, the research introduces POW-dTS,
a novel policy weighting algorithm based on Discounted Thompson Sampling. This
method allows agents to dynamically select and combine pretrained policies,
enabling continual adaptation to shifting market conditions.
  The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RL-based approaches
significantly outperform traditional and baseline algorithmic strategies across
various performance metrics. Overall, this research thesis contributes new
methodologies and insights for the design of robust, efficient, and adaptive
market making agents, reinforcing the potential of RL to transform algorithmic
trading in complex financial systems.

Abstract: Concept probing has recently gained popularity as a way for humans to peek
into what is encoded within artificial neural networks. In concept probing,
additional classifiers are trained to map the internal representations of a
model into human-defined concepts of interest. However, the performance of
these probes is highly dependent on the internal representations they probe
from, making identifying the appropriate layer to probe an essential task. In
this paper, we propose a method to automatically identify which layer's
representations in a neural network model should be considered when probing for
a given human-defined concept of interest, based on how informative and regular
the representations are with respect to the concept. We validate our findings
through an exhaustive empirical analysis over different neural network models
and datasets.

yet been well studied. In this paper, we empirically find that the deleted data
has an impact on the pruned topology in a sparse model. Motivated by the
observation and the right to be forgotten, we define a new terminology
``un-pruning" to eliminate the impact of deleted data on model pruning. Then we
propose an un-pruning algorithm to approximate the pruned topology driven by
retained data. We remark that any existing unlearning algorithm can be
integrated with the proposed un-pruning workflow and the error of un-pruning is
upper-bounded in theory. Also, our un-pruning algorithm can be applied to both
structured sparse models and unstructured sparse models. In the experiment, we
further find that Membership Inference Attack (MIA) accuracy is unreliable for
assessing whether a model has forgotten deleted data, as a small change in the
amount of deleted data can produce arbitrary MIA results. Accordingly, we
devise new performance metrics for sparse models to evaluate the success of
un-pruning. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to verify the efficacy of
un-pruning with various pruning methods and unlearning algorithms. Our code is
released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/UnlearningSparseModels-FBC5/.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，在多臂老虎机（MAB）算法的离线评估中，纯贪婪策略（无探索）在大多数情况下表现最佳，揭示了当前评估方法在衡量探索行为上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨MAB算法在推荐系统中离线评估的局限性，特别是探索行为的可靠性问题。

Method: 通过广泛的离线实证比较多种线性MAB算法，包括贪婪线性模型及其探索性变体。

Result: 超过90%的数据集中，贪婪线性模型表现最佳，超参数优化也倾向于最小化探索的配置。

Conclusion: 当前离线评估方法无法准确反映探索效果，亟需开发更稳健的评估框架。

Abstract: Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms are widely used in recommender systems
that require continuous, incremental learning. A core aspect of MABs is the
exploration-exploitation trade-off: choosing between exploiting items likely to
be enjoyed and exploring new ones to gather information. In contextual linear
bandits, this trade-off is particularly central, as many variants share the
same linear regression backbone and differ primarily in their exploration
strategies. Despite its prevalent use, offline evaluation of MABs is
increasingly recognized for its limitations in reliably assessing exploration
behavior. This study conducts an extensive offline empirical comparison of
several linear MABs. Strikingly, across over 90% of various datasets, a greedy
linear model, with no type of exploration, consistently achieves top-tier
performance, often outperforming or matching its exploratory counterparts. This
observation is further corroborated by hyperparameter optimization, which
consistently favors configurations that minimize exploration, suggesting that
pure exploitation is the dominant strategy within these evaluation settings.
Our results expose significant inadequacies in offline evaluation protocols for
bandits, particularly concerning their capacity to reflect true exploratory
efficacy. Consequently, this research underscores the urgent necessity for
developing more robust assessment methodologies, guiding future investigations
into alternative evaluation frameworks for interactive learning in recommender
systems.

TL;DR: CLEAR框架通过对比学习与反对比正则化分离任务相关与无关特征，提升测试时特征变化的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗等应用中，确保模型不受种族、性别等无关特征影响，以提高预测的公平性和泛化性。

Method: 提出CLEAR框架，结合对比学习和Pair-Switching正则化，分离内容与风格特征。

Result: 实验表明CLEAR-VAE能交换和插值内容与风格，并在新组合下提升分类性能。

Conclusion: CLEAR有效分离任务相关与无关特征，提升模型鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Learning representations unaffected by superficial characteristics is
important to ensure that shifts in these characteristics at test time do not
compromise downstream prediction performance. For instance, in healthcare
applications, we might like to learn features that contain information about
pathology yet are unaffected by race, sex, and other sources of physiologic
variability, thereby ensuring predictions are equitable and generalizable
across all demographics. Here we propose Contrastive LEarning with
Anti-contrastive Regularization (CLEAR), an intuitive and easy-to-implement
framework that effectively separates essential (i.e., task-relevant)
characteristics from superficial (i.e., task-irrelevant) characteristics during
training, leading to better performance when superficial characteristics shift
at test time. We begin by supposing that data representations can be
semantically separated into task-relevant content features, which contain
information relevant to downstream tasks, and task-irrelevant style features,
which encompass superficial attributes that are irrelevant to these tasks, yet
may degrade performance due to associations with content present in training
data that do not generalize. We then prove that our anti-contrastive penalty,
which we call Pair-Switching (PS), minimizes the Mutual Information between the
style attributes and content labels. Finally, we instantiate CLEAR in the
latent space of a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), then perform experiments to
quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the resulting CLEAR-VAE over several
image datasets. Our results show that CLEAR-VAE allows us to: (a) swap and
interpolate content and style between any pair of samples, and (b) improve
downstream classification performance in the presence of previously unseen
combinations of content and style. Our code will be made publicly available.

*Wencheng Zou,Nan Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了图神经网络（GNNs）在硬件故障（如位翻转错误）下的鲁棒性问题，并提出了一种轻量级解决方案Ralts，通过图相似性度量增强GNN的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注软件层面的威胁，而硬件引起的故障和错误尚未充分研究。随着硬件系统向先进技术节点发展，瞬态故障（如位翻转）问题日益突出，可能对安全关键应用（如金融和医疗网络）造成严重后果。

Method: 论文首先全面分析了GNN在位翻转错误下的鲁棒性，随后提出Ralts解决方案。Ralts利用图相似性度量过滤异常值并恢复受损的图拓扑结构，并将这些保护技术直接集成到聚合函数中，适用于任何消息传递GNN。

Result: 实验表明，Ralts显著提升了GNN的鲁棒性，在不同GNN模型、图数据集和错误模式下，预测准确率平均提高至少20%（权重或节点嵌入错误）或10%（邻接矩阵错误）。Ralts的执行效率与PyTorch Geometric内置聚合函数相当。

Conclusion: Ralts是一种通用且高效的解决方案，能够有效增强GNN对硬件故障的鲁棒性，为未来可靠且高效的GNN系统提供了优化方向。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in safety-critical
applications, such as financial and medical networks, in which compromised
predictions may cause catastrophic consequences. While existing research on GNN
robustness has primarily focused on software-level threats, hardware-induced
faults and errors remain largely underexplored. As hardware systems progress
toward advanced technology nodes to meet high-performance and energy efficiency
demands, they become increasingly susceptible to transient faults, which can
cause bit flips and silent data corruption, a prominent issue observed by major
technology companies (e.g., Meta and Google). In response, we first present a
comprehensive analysis of GNN robustness against bit-flip errors, aiming to
reveal system-level optimization opportunities for future reliable and
efficient GNN systems. Second, we propose Ralts, a generalizable and
lightweight solution to bolster GNN resilience to bit-flip errors.
Specifically, Ralts exploits various graph similarity metrics to filter out
outliers and recover compromised graph topology, and incorporates these
protective techniques directly into aggregation functions to support any
message-passing GNNs. Evaluation results demonstrate that Ralts effectively
enhances GNN robustness across a range of GNN models, graph datasets, error
patterns, and both dense and sparse architectures. On average, under a BER of
$3\times10^{-5}$, these robust aggregation functions improve prediction
accuracy by at least 20\% when errors present in model weights or node
embeddings, and by at least 10\% when errors occur in adjacency matrices. Ralts
is also optimized to deliver execution efficiency comparable to built-in
aggregation functions in PyTorch Geometric.

*YuXin Li,Felix Dangel,Derek Tam,Colin Raffel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“Squisher”的方法，通过复用训练过程中已计算的平方梯度累加器来近似Fisher对角矩阵，以减少计算成本。实验表明其性能与Fisher对角矩阵相当，且优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fisher对角矩阵常用于衡量参数敏感性，但计算成本较高。自适应梯度方法（如Adam）在训练过程中已计算了平方梯度的移动平均值，因此探索是否可以利用这些数据近似Fisher对角矩阵。

Method: 提出“Squisher”方法，利用训练过程中已计算的平方梯度累加器近似Fisher对角矩阵。通过五种应用场景的实验验证其有效性。

Result: 实验表明，Squisher在性能上与Fisher对角矩阵相当，且优于基线方法。论文还量化了Squisher与Fisher对角矩阵的具体差异及其影响。

Conclusion: Squisher提供了一种高效且低成本的Fisher对角矩阵近似方法，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: The diagonal of a model's Fisher Information Matrix (the "Fisher diagonal")
has frequently been used as a way to measure parameter sensitivity. Typically,
the Fisher diagonal is estimated via squared sampled gradients of the model's
likelihood with respect to its parameters, averaged over a few hundred or
thousand examples -- a process which incurs nontrivial computational costs. At
the same time, adaptive gradient methods like the ubiquitous Adam optimizer
compute a moving average of the squared gradient over the course of training.
This paper therefore explores whether an approximation of the Fisher diagonal
can be obtained "for free" by recycling the squared gradient accumulator that
has already been computed over the course of training. Through a comprehensive
set of experiments covering five applications of the Fisher diagonal, we
demonstrate that the "Squisher" (SQUared gradient accumulator as an
approximation of the FISHER) consistently performs similarly to the Fisher
diagonal while outperforming baseline methods. Additionally, we clarify the
exact differences between the Squisher and the Fisher diagonal and provide
empirical quantification of their respective impact.

Motivation: 研究动机在于探索如何通过测试时训练提升离线强化学习算法的性能，类似于基础模型在测试时通过微调提升效果。

Method: 方法包括提出自监督数据选择标准，选择与当前状态和目标相关的数据，并在测试时进行少量梯度步的微调。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在高维运动导航和操作任务中显著优于标准离线预训练方法。

Conclusion: 结论是GC-TTT算法在推理时通过动态调整策略，以低成本实现了性能提升，且效果优于单纯增加模型规模。

Abstract: Foundation models compress a large amount of information in a single, large
neural network, which can then be queried for individual tasks. There are
strong parallels between this widespread framework and offline goal-conditioned
reinforcement learning algorithms: a universal value function is trained on a
large number of goals, and the policy is evaluated on a single goal in each
test episode. Extensive research in foundation models has shown that
performance can be substantially improved through test-time training,
specializing the model to the current goal. We find similarly that test-time
offline reinforcement learning on experience related to the test goal can lead
to substantially better policies at minimal compute costs. We propose a novel
self-supervised data selection criterion, which selects transitions from an
offline dataset according to their relevance to the current state and quality
with respect to the evaluation goal. We demonstrate across a wide range of
high-dimensional loco-navigation and manipulation tasks that fine-tuning a
policy on the selected data for a few gradient steps leads to significant
performance gains over standard offline pre-training. Our goal-conditioned
test-time training (GC-TTT) algorithm applies this routine in a
receding-horizon fashion during evaluation, adapting the policy to the current
trajectory as it is being rolled out. Finally, we study compute allocation at
inference, demonstrating that, at comparable costs, GC-TTT induces performance
gains that are not achievable by scaling model size.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative neural networks, particularly flow matching
(FM), have enabled the generation of high-fidelity samples while significantly
reducing computational costs. A promising application of these models is
accelerating simulations in high-energy physics (HEP), helping research
institutions meet their increasing computational demands. In this work, we
leverage FM to develop surrogate models for fast simulations of zero degree
calorimeters in the ALICE experiment. We present an effective training strategy
that enables the training of fast generative models with an exceptionally low
number of parameters. This approach achieves state-of-the-art simulation
fidelity for both neutron (ZN) and proton (ZP) detectors, while offering
substantial reductions in computational costs compared to existing methods. Our
FM model achieves a Wasserstein distance of 1.27 for the ZN simulation with an
inference time of 0.46 ms per sample, compared to the current best of 1.20 with
an inference time of approximately 109 ms. The latent FM model further improves
the inference speed, reducing the sampling time to 0.026 ms per sample, with a
minimal trade-off in accuracy. Similarly, our approach achieves a Wasserstein
distance of 1.30 for the ZP simulation, outperforming the current best of 2.08.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ML模型在PDE求解中无法泛化到训练数据之外，如固定Reynolds数或预定义域。

Method: 利用PDE的尺度一致性特性设计数据增强方案和尺度感知神经算子，引入尺度一致性损失。

Result: 模型在Burgers方程、Darcy流、Helmholtz方程和Navier-Stokes方程上表现优异，泛化能力显著提升，误差平均降低34%。

Conclusion: 尺度一致性损失和尺度感知神经算子有效提升了ML模型在PDE求解中的泛化能力和精度。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have emerged as a promising approach for solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) in science and engineering. Previous ML
models typically cannot generalize outside the training data; for example, a
trained ML model for the Navier-Stokes equations only works for a fixed
Reynolds number ($Re$) on a pre-defined domain. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a data augmentation scheme based on scale-consistency properties of
PDEs and design a scale-informed neural operator that can model a wide range of
scales. Our formulation leverages the facts: (i) PDEs can be rescaled, or more
concretely, a given domain can be re-scaled to unit size, and the parameters
and the boundary conditions of the PDE can be appropriately adjusted to
represent the original solution, and (ii) the solution operators on a given
domain are consistent on the sub-domains. We leverage these facts to create a
scale-consistency loss that encourages matching the solutions evaluated on a
given domain and the solution obtained on its sub-domain from the rescaled PDE.
Since neural operators can fit to multiple scales and resolutions, they are the
natural choice for incorporating scale-consistency loss during training of
neural PDE solvers. We experiment with scale-consistency loss and the
scale-informed neural operator model on the Burgers' equation, Darcy Flow,
Helmholtz equation, and Navier-Stokes equations. With scale-consistency, the
model trained on $Re$ of 1000 can generalize to $Re$ ranging from 250 to 10000,
and reduces the error by 34% on average of all datasets compared to baselines.

Conclusion: 提出的框架具有可扩展性和鲁棒性，为W2SG在复杂环境中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Weak-to-Strong generalization (W2SG) is a new trend to elicit the full
capabilities of a strong model with supervision from a weak model. While
existing W2SG studies focus on simple tasks like binary classification, we
extend this paradigm to complex interactive decision-making environments.
Specifically, we fine-tune a strong model with trajectories of intermediate
actions generated by a weak model. Motivated by the human learning process, we
propose to generalize not only success knowledge but also failure experience so
that the strong model can learn from failed trajectories accumulated by weak
models. To effectively and efficiently elicit the potential of strong agents,
we further construct ``trajectory trees," a hierarchical representation that
organizes weak model-generated action trajectories, coupled with Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) to optimize the strong model. Through theoretical analysis,
we provide formal guarantees for the effectiveness of our method in improving
W2SG performance. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate substantial
improvements in reasoning and decision-making capabilities across diverse task
domains, validating the scalability and robustness of our proposed framework.

Motivation: HKD患者在ICU中短期死亡率高，但缺乏定制化的风险预测工具，早期识别高风险患者对临床决策至关重要。

Method: 利用MIMIC-IV v2.2数据库的早期临床数据，通过随机森林和互信息筛选18个特征，训练并比较多个模型，CatBoost表现最优。

Result: CatBoost在独立测试集上AUROC为0.88，敏感性0.811，特异性0.798，模型依赖有意义的预测因子如意识状态、血管加压药使用等。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个可解释的机器学习流程，结合高预测性能和不确定性量化，支持个体化分诊和透明临床决策，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Background: Hypertensive kidney disease (HKD) patients in intensive care
units (ICUs) face high short-term mortality, but tailored risk prediction tools
are lacking. Early identification of high-risk individuals is crucial for
clinical decision-making. Methods: We developed a machine learning framework to
predict 30-day in-hospital mortality among ICU patients with HKD using early
clinical data from the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database. A cohort of 1,366 adults was
curated with strict criteria, excluding malignancy cases. Eighteen clinical
features-including vital signs, labs, comorbidities, and therapies-were
selected via random forest importance and mutual information filtering. Several
models were trained and compared with stratified five-fold cross-validation;
CatBoost demonstrated the best performance. Results: CatBoost achieved an AUROC
of 0.88 on the independent test set, with sensitivity of 0.811 and specificity
of 0.798. SHAP values and Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) plots showed the
model relied on meaningful predictors such as altered consciousness,
vasopressor use, and coagulation status. Additionally, the DREAM algorithm was
integrated to estimate patient-specific posterior risk distributions, allowing
clinicians to assess both predicted mortality and its uncertainty. Conclusions:
We present an interpretable machine learning pipeline for early, real-time risk
assessment in ICU patients with HKD. By combining high predictive performance
with uncertainty quantification, our model supports individualized triage and
transparent clinical decisions. This approach shows promise for clinical
deployment and merits external validation in broader critical care populations.

Method: 提出LIGHT框架，整合人类专家知识，通过个体动作分布和人类偏好分布设计内在奖励，优化Q学习。

Result: 实验表明LIGHT在稀疏奖励任务中性能优于基线方法，且知识可重用性更强。

Conclusion: LIGHT有效结合人类知识与MARL，提升探索效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Efficient exploration in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a
challenging problem when receiving only a team reward, especially in
environments with sparse rewards. A powerful method to mitigate this issue
involves crafting dense individual rewards to guide the agents toward efficient
exploration. However, individual rewards generally rely on manually engineered
shaping-reward functions that lack high-order intelligence, thus it behaves
ineffectively than humans regarding learning and generalization in complex
problems. To tackle these issues, we combine the above two paradigms and
propose a novel framework, LIGHT (Learning Individual Intrinsic reward via
Incorporating Generalized Human experTise), which can integrate human knowledge
into MARL algorithms in an end-to-end manner. LIGHT guides each agent to avoid
unnecessary exploration by considering both individual action distribution and
human expertise preference distribution. Then, LIGHT designs individual
intrinsic rewards for each agent based on actionable representational
transformation relevant to Q-learning so that the agents align their action
preferences with the human expertise while maximizing the joint action value.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over
representative baselines regarding performance and better knowledge reusability
across different sparse-reward tasks on challenging scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 血脑屏障通透性（BBBP）预测对中枢神经系统药物开发至关重要，现有图神经网络（GNNs）常忽略三维几何信息。

Method: GMC-MPNN通过原子级几何特征和长程相互作用增强标准消息传递架构，构建加权彩色子图捕捉空间关系和化学背景。

Result: 在分类和回归任务中，GMC-MPNN表现优于现有模型（AUC-ROC达0.9704，RMSE为0.4609）。

Conclusion: GMC-MPNN通过整合空间几何信息，为药物发现提供了更准确、通用的工具。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of blood-brain barrier permeability (BBBP) is essential
for central nervous system (CNS) drug development. While graph neural networks
(GNNs) have advanced molecular property prediction, they often rely on
molecular topology and neglect the three-dimensional geometric information
crucial for modeling transport mechanisms. This paper introduces the geometric
multi-color message-passing graph neural network (GMC-MPNN), a novel framework
that enhances standard message-passing architectures by explicitly
incorporating atomic-level geometric features and long-range interactions. Our
model constructs weighted colored subgraphs based on atom types to capture the
spatial relationships and chemical context that govern BBB permeability. We
evaluated GMC-MPNN on three benchmark datasets for both classification and
regression tasks, using rigorous scaffold-based splitting to ensure a robust
assessment of generalization. The results demonstrate that GMC-MPNN
consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving superior
performance in both classifying compounds as permeable/non-permeable (AUC-ROC
of 0.9704 and 0.9685) and in regressing continuous permeability values (RMSE of
0.4609, Pearson correlation of 0.7759). An ablation study further quantified
the impact of specific atom-pair interactions, revealing that the model's
predictive power derives from its ability to learn from both common and rare,
but chemically significant, functional motifs. By integrating spatial geometry
into the graph representation, GMC-MPNN sets a new performance benchmark and
offers a more accurate and generalizable tool for drug discovery pipelines.

Motivation: 在多臂老虎机问题中，传统最优算法容易暴露最佳臂信息，而简单安全算法性能较差。需要一种既能高效识别最佳臂又能保护信息安全的算法。

Method: 提出了一种使用编码臂的安全算法，无需密钥或加密原语，通过巧妙设计臂的选择策略隐藏最佳臂信息。

Result: 算法实现了Ω(T/log²(d))的错误指数，同时几乎不泄露最佳臂信息。

Conclusion: 该算法在保护信息安全的同时，显著提升了性能，为安全多臂老虎机问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Consider the problem of best arm identification with a security constraint.
Specifically, assume a setup of stochastic linear bandits with $K$ arms of
dimension $d$. In each arm pull, the player receives a reward that is the sum
of the dot product of the arm with an unknown parameter vector and independent
noise. The player's goal is to identify the best arm after $T$ arm pulls.
Moreover, assume a copycat Chloe is observing the arm pulls. The player wishes
to keep Chloe ignorant of the best arm.
  While a minimax--optimal algorithm identifies the best arm with an
$\Omega\left(\frac{T}{\log(d)}\right)$ error exponent, it easily reveals its
best-arm estimate to an outside observer, as the best arms are played more
frequently. A naive secure algorithm that plays all arms equally results in an
$\Omega\left(\frac{T}{d}\right)$ exponent. In this paper, we propose a secure
algorithm that plays with \emph{coded arms}. The algorithm does not require any
key or cryptographic primitives, yet achieves an
$\Omega\left(\frac{T}{\log^2(d)}\right)$ exponent while revealing almost no
information on the best arm.

Conclusion: 该研究为金融市场提供了一种制度感知、透明且稳健的预测新方向。

Abstract: Forecasting in financial markets remains a significant challenge due to their
nonlinear and regime-dependent dynamics. Traditional deep learning models, such
as long short-term memory networks and multilayer perceptrons, often struggle
to generalize across shifting market conditions, highlighting the need for a
more adaptive and interpretable approach. To address this, we introduce
Kolmogorov-Arnold networks for stock prediction and explainable regimes
(KASPER), a novel framework that integrates regime detection, sparse
spline-based function modeling, and symbolic rule extraction. The framework
identifies hidden market conditions using a Gumbel-Softmax-based mechanism,
enabling regime-specific forecasting. For each regime, it employs
Kolmogorov-Arnold networks with sparse spline activations to capture intricate
price behaviors while maintaining robustness. Interpretability is achieved
through symbolic learning based on Monte Carlo Shapley values, which extracts
human-readable rules tailored to each regime. Applied to real-world financial
time series from Yahoo Finance, the model achieves an $R^2$ score of 0.89, a
Sharpe Ratio of 12.02, and a mean squared error as low as 0.0001, outperforming
existing methods. This research establishes a new direction for regime-aware,

Abstract: Differentiated thyroid cancer DTC recurrence is a major public health
concern, requiring classification and predictive models that are not only
accurate but also interpretable and uncertainty aware. This study introduces a
comprehensive framework for DTC recurrence classification using a dataset
containing 383 patients and 16 clinical and pathological variables. Initially,
11 machine learning ML models were employed using the complete dataset, where
the Support Vector Machines SVM model achieved the highest accuracy of 0.9481.
To reduce complexity and redundancy, feature selection was carried out using
the Boruta algorithm, and the same ML models were applied to the reduced
dataset, where it was observed that the Logistic Regression LR model obtained
the maximum accuracy of 0.9611. However, these ML models often lack uncertainty
quantification, which is critical in clinical decision making. Therefore, to
address this limitation, the Bayesian Neural Networks BNN with six varying
prior distributions, including Normal 0,1, Normal 0,10, Laplace 0,1, Cauchy
0,1, Cauchy 0,2.5, and Horseshoe 1, were implemented on both the complete and
reduced datasets. The BNN model with Normal 0,10 prior distribution exhibited
maximum accuracies of 0.9740 and 0.9870 before and after feature selection,
respectively.

TL;DR: GENIAL是一个基于机器学习的框架，用于自动生成和优化算术单元（如乘法器），通过Transformer模型预测硬件指标并优化设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统设计流程依赖手动或启发式优化，难以全面探索设计空间，因此需要自动化工具以提高效率。

Method: GENIAL采用两阶段训练的Transformer模型（自监督预训练+监督微调），通过反演模型搜索最优操作数编码以减少功耗。

Abstract: As AI workloads proliferate, optimizing arithmetic units is becoming
increasingly important to reduce the footprint of digital systems. Conventional
design flows, which often rely on manual or heuristics-based optimization, are
limited in their ability to thoroughly explore the vast design space. In this
paper, we introduce GENIAL, a machine learning-based framework for the
automatic generation and optimization of arithmetic units, more specifically
multipliers.
  At the core of GENIAL is a Transformer-based surrogate model trained in two
stages, involving self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised
finetuning, to robustly forecast key hardware metrics such as power and area
from abstracted design representations. By inverting the surrogate model,
GENIAL efficiently searches for new operand encodings that directly minimize
power consumption in arithmetic units for specific input data distributions.
Extensive experiments on large datasets demonstrate that GENIAL is consistently
more sample efficient than other methods, and converges faster towards
optimized designs. This enables to deploy a high-effort logic synthesis
optimization flow in the loop, improving the accuracy of the surrogate model.
Notably, GENIAL automatically discovers encodings that achieve up to 18%
switching activity savings within multipliers on representative AI workloads
compared with the conventional two's complement. We also demonstrate the
versatility of our approach by achieving significant improvements on Finite
State Machines, highlighting GENIAL's applicability for a wide spectrum of
logic functions. Together, these advances mark a significant step toward
automated Quality-of-Results-optimized combinational circuit generation for
digital systems.

Method: 提出保守智能体，将随机延迟环境转化为恒定延迟等效环境，无需修改算法结构即可应用现有方法。

Result: 在连续控制任务中，保守智能体方法在渐近性能和样本效率上显著优于基线算法。

Conclusion: 保守智能体方法为随机延迟环境提供了一种简单且高效的解决方案，扩展了现有方法的适用性。

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning applications are often hindered by delayed
feedback from environments, which violates the Markov assumption and introduces
significant challenges. Although numerous delay-compensating methods have been
proposed for environments with constant delays, environments with random delays
remain largely unexplored due to their inherent variability and
unpredictability. In this study, we propose a simple yet robust agent for
decision-making under random delays, termed the conservative agent, which
reformulates the random-delay environment into its constant-delay equivalent.
This transformation enables any state-of-the-art constant-delay method to be
directly extended to the random-delay environments without modifying the
algorithmic structure or sacrificing performance. We evaluate the conservative
agent-based algorithm on continuous control tasks, and empirical results
demonstrate that it significantly outperforms existing baseline algorithms in
terms of asymptotic performance and sample efficiency.

Result: 在七种基准测试中，FADE在严重偏移下准确率提升高达19%，优于TENT和DIW等方法。

Conclusion: FADE在理论和实践中均表现出色，适用于联邦学习等分散环境。

Abstract: Modern machine learning systems operating in dynamic environments often face
\textit{sequential covariate shift} (SCS), where input distributions evolve
over time while the conditional distribution remains stable. We introduce FADE
(Fisher-based Adaptation to Dynamic Environments), a lightweight and
theoretically grounded framework for robust learning under SCS. FADE employs a
shift-aware regularization mechanism anchored in Fisher information geometry,
guiding adaptation by modulating parameter updates based on sensitivity and
stability. To detect significant distribution changes, we propose a
Cramer-Rao-informed shift signal that integrates KL divergence with temporal
Fisher dynamics. Unlike prior methods requiring task boundaries, target
supervision, or experience replay, FADE operates online with fixed memory and
no access to target labels. Evaluated on seven benchmarks spanning vision,
language, and tabular data, FADE achieves up to 19\% higher accuracy under
severe shifts, outperforming methods such as TENT and DIW. FADE also
generalizes naturally to federated learning by treating heterogeneous clients
as temporally fragmented environments, enabling scalable and stable adaptation
in decentralized settings. Theoretical analysis guarantees bounded regret and
parameter consistency, while empirical results demonstrate FADE's robustness
across modalities and shift intensities.

Motivation: 传统分数生成模型将价格轨迹视为普通数值序列，忽略了金融时间序列的异方差性。本文旨在通过结合GBM改进噪声注入方式。

Method: 在正向噪声过程中按资产价格比例注入噪声，平衡漂移和扩散项，使对数价格过程转化为方差爆炸的随机微分方程。反向生成过程采用基于Transformer的CSDI框架进行训练。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过结合GBM改进了金融时间序列的生成，更准确地模拟了金融数据的统计特性。

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based generative framework for financial time
series that incorporates geometric Brownian motion (GBM), the foundation of the
Black--Scholes theory, into the forward noising process. Unlike standard
score-based models that treat price trajectories as generic numerical
sequences, our method injects noise proportionally to asset prices at each time
step, reflecting the heteroskedasticity observed in financial time series. By
accurately balancing the drift and diffusion terms, we show that the resulting
log-price process reduces to a variance-exploding stochastic differential
equation, aligning with the formulation in score-based generative models. The
reverse-time generative process is trained via denoising score matching using a
Transformer-based architecture adapted from the Conditional Score-based
Diffusion Imputation (CSDI) framework. Empirical evaluations on historical
stock data demonstrate that our model reproduces key stylized facts
heavy-tailed return distributions, volatility clustering, and the leverage
effect more realistically than conventional diffusion models.

Result: 在多个模型上，MindSpeed RL的吞吐量提升1.42~3.97倍。

Conclusion: MindSpeed RL显著提升性能，并展示了Ascend NPU的强大能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a paradigm increasingly used to align large
language models. Popular RL algorithms utilize multiple workers and can be
modeled as a graph, where each node is the status of a worker and each edge
represents dataflow between nodes. Owing to the heavy cross-node dependencies,
the RL training system usually suffers from poor cluster scalability and low
memory utilization. In this article, we introduce MindSpeed RL, an effective
and efficient system for large-scale RL training. Unlike existing centralized
methods, MindSpeed RL organizes the essential data dependencies in RL training,
i.e., sample flow and resharding flow, from a distributed view. On the one
hand, a distributed transfer dock strategy, which sets controllers and
warehouses on the basis of the conventional replay buffer, is designed to
release the dispatch overhead in the sample flow. A practical allgather--swap
strategy is presented to eliminate redundant memory usage in resharding flow.
In addition, MindSpeed RL further integrates numerous parallelization
strategies and acceleration techniques for systematic optimization. Compared
with existing state-of-the-art systems, comprehensive experiments on the RL
training of popular Qwen2.5-Dense-7B/32B, Qwen3-MoE-30B, and
DeepSeek-R1-MoE-671B show that MindSpeed RL increases the throughput by 1.42 ~
3.97 times. Finally, we open--source MindSpeed RL and perform all the
experiments on a super pod of Ascend with 384 neural processing units (NPUs) to
demonstrate the powerful performance and reliability of Ascend.

Result: 在八个真实图数据集上验证了ProGMLP的高准确性和动态适应性。

Conclusion: ProGMLP适用于多样化的应用场景，能有效平衡推理成本与准确性。

Abstract: GNN-to-MLP (G2M) methods have emerged as a promising approach to accelerate
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by distilling their knowledge into simpler
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). These methods bridge the gap between the
expressive power of GNNs and the computational efficiency of MLPs, making them
well-suited for resource-constrained environments. However, existing G2M
methods are limited by their inability to flexibly adjust inference cost and
accuracy dynamically, a critical requirement for real-world applications where
computational resources and time constraints can vary significantly. To address
this, we introduce a Progressive framework designed to offer flexible and
on-demand trade-offs between inference cost and accuracy for GNN-to-MLP
knowledge distillation (ProGMLP). ProGMLP employs a Progressive Training
Structure (PTS), where multiple MLP students are trained in sequence, each
building on the previous one. Furthermore, ProGMLP incorporates Progressive
Knowledge Distillation (PKD) to iteratively refine the distillation process
from GNNs to MLPs, and Progressive Mixup Augmentation (PMA) to enhance
generalization by progressively generating harder mixed samples. Our approach
is validated through comprehensive experiments on eight real-world graph
datasets, demonstrating that ProGMLP maintains high accuracy while dynamically
adapting to varying runtime scenarios, making it highly effective for
deployment in diverse application settings.

Abstract: Forecasting system behaviour near and across bifurcations is crucial for
identifying potential shifts in dynamical systems. While machine learning has
recently been used to learn critical transitions and bifurcation structures
from data, most studies remain limited as they exclusively focus on
discrete-time methods and local bifurcations. To address these limitations, we
use Neural Ordinary Differential Equations which provide a continuous,
data-driven framework for learning system dynamics. We apply our approach to a
predator-prey system that features both local and global bifurcations,
presenting a challenging test case. Our results show that Neural Ordinary
Differential Equations can recover underlying bifurcation structures directly
from timeseries data by learning parameter-dependent vector fields. Notably, we
demonstrate that Neural Ordinary Differential Equations can forecast
bifurcations even beyond the parameter regions represented in the training
data. We also assess the method's performance under limited and noisy data
conditions, finding that model accuracy depends more on the quality of
information that can be inferred from the training data, than on the amount of
data available.

Conclusion: DyRC-VG框架通过动态信息直接构建储层网络，显著提升了预测性能，为复杂时间序列预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of complex and nonlinear time series remains a
challenging problem across engineering and scientific disciplines. Reservoir
computing (RC) offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional
deep learning by training only the read-out layer while employing a randomly
structured and fixed reservoir network. Despite its advantages, the largely
random reservoir graph architecture often results in suboptimal and oversized
networks with poorly understood dynamics. Addressing this issue, we propose a
novel Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing (DyRC) framework that
systematically infers the reservoir network structure directly from the input
training sequence. This work proposes to employ the visibility graph (VG)
technique, which converts time series data into networks by representing
measurement points as nodes linked by mutual visibility. The reservoir network
is constructed by directly adopting the VG network from a training data
sequence, leveraging the parameter-free visibility graph approach to avoid
expensive hyperparameter tuning. This process results in a reservoir that is
directly informed by the specific dynamics of the prediction task under study.
We assess the DyRC-VG method through prediction tasks involving the canonical
nonlinear Duffing oscillator, evaluating prediction accuracy and consistency.
Compared to an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph of the same size, spectral radius, and
comparable density, we observe higher prediction quality and more consistent
performance over repeated implementations in the DyRC-VG.

Abstract: Molecular assembly offers a promising path to detect life beyond Earth, while
minimizing assumptions based on terrestrial life. As mass spectrometers will be
central to upcoming Solar System missions, predicting molecular assembly from
their data without needing to elucidate unknown structures will be essential
for unbiased life detection. An ideal agnostic biosignature must be
interpretable and experimentally measurable. Here, we show that molecular
assembly, a recently developed approach to measure objects that have been
produced by evolution, satisfies both criteria. First, it is interpretable for
life detection, as it reflects the assembly of molecules with their bonds as
building blocks, in contrast to approaches that discount construction history.
Second, it can be determined without structural elucidation, as it can be
physically measured by mass spectrometry, a property that distinguishes it from
other approaches that use structure-based information measures for molecular
complexity. Whilst molecular assembly is directly measurable using mass
spectrometry data, there are limits imposed by mission constraints. To address
this, we developed a machine learning model that predicts molecular assembly
with high accuracy, reducing error by three-fold compared to baseline models.
Simulated data shows that even small instrumental inconsistencies can double
model error, emphasizing the need for standardization. These results suggest
that standardized mass spectrometry databases could enable accurate molecular
assembly prediction, without structural elucidation, providing a
proof-of-concept for future astrobiology missions.

Abstract: Attribute-missing graph clustering has emerged as a significant unsupervised
task, where only attribute vectors of partial nodes are available and the graph
structure is intact. The related models generally follow the two-step paradigm
of imputation and refinement. However, most imputation approaches fail to
capture class-relevant semantic information, leading to sub-optimal imputation
for clustering. Moreover, existing refinement strategies optimize the learned
embedding through graph reconstruction, while neglecting the fact that some
attributes are uncorrelated with the graph. To remedy the problems, we
establish the Clustering-oriented Generative Imputation with reliable
Refinement (CGIR) model. Concretely, the subcluster distributions are estimated
to reveal the class-specific characteristics precisely, and constrain the
sampling space of the generative adversarial module, such that the imputation
nodes are impelled to align with the correct clusters. Afterwards, multiple
subclusters are merged to guide the proposed edge attention network, which
identifies the edge-wise attributes for each class, so as to avoid the
redundant attributes in graph reconstruction from disturbing the refinement of
overall embedding. To sum up, CGIR splits attribute-missing graph clustering
into the search and mergence of subclusters, which guides to implement node
imputation and refinement within a unified framework. Extensive experiments
prove the advantages of CGIR over state-of-the-art competitors.

Conclusion: GCL-GCN通过创新的模块设计显著提升了图聚类的性能，为复杂图数据分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Attributed graph clustering holds significant importance in modern data
analysis. However, due to the complexity of graph data and the heterogeneity of
node attributes, leveraging graph information for clustering remains
challenging. To address this, we propose a novel deep graph clustering model,
GCL-GCN, specifically designed to address the limitations of existing models in
capturing local dependencies and complex structures when dealing with sparse
and heterogeneous graph data. GCL-GCN introduces an innovative Graphormer
module that combines centrality encoding and spatial relationships, effectively
capturing both global and local information between nodes, thereby enhancing
the quality of node representations. Additionally, we propose a novel
contrastive learning module that significantly enhances the discriminative
power of feature representations. In the pre-training phase, this module
increases feature distinction through contrastive learning on the original
feature matrix, ensuring more identifiable initial representations for
subsequent graph convolution and clustering tasks. Extensive experimental
results on six datasets demonstrate that GCL-GCN outperforms 14 advanced
methods in terms of clustering quality and robustness. Specifically, on the
Cora dataset, it improves ACC, NMI, and ARI by 4.94%, 13.01%, and 10.97%,
respectively, compared to the primary comparison method MBN.

Abstract: Ensuring privacy in large-scale open datasets is increasingly challenging
under regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). While
differential privacy (DP) provides strong theoretical guarantees, it primarily
focuses on noise injection during model training, neglecting privacy
preservation at the data publishing stage. Existing privacy-preserving data
publishing (PPDP) approaches struggle to balance privacy and utility,
particularly when data publishers and users are distinct entities. To address
this gap, we focus on the graph recovery problem and propose a novel
privacy-preserving estimation framework for open graph data, leveraging
Gaussian DP (GDP) with a structured noise-injection mechanism. Unlike
traditional methods that perturb gradients or model updates, our approach
ensures unbiased graph structure recovery while enforcing DP at the data
publishing stage. Moreover, we provide theoretical guarantees on estimation
accuracy and extend our method to discrete-variable graphs, a setting often
overlooked in DP research. Experimental results in graph learning demonstrate
robust performance, offering a viable solution for privacy-conscious graph
analysis.

Abstract: Accurate detection and localization of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels in
satellite imagery is essential for optimizing microgrids and active
distribution networks (ADNs), which are critical components of renewable energy
systems. Existing methods lack transparency regarding their underlying
algorithms or training datasets, rely on large, high-quality PV training data,
and struggle to generalize to new geographic regions or varied environmental
conditions without extensive re-training. These limitations lead to
inconsistent detection outcomes, hindering large-scale deployment and
data-driven grid optimization. In this paper, we investigate how large language
models (LLMs) can be leveraged to overcome these challenges. Despite their
promise, LLMs face several challenges in solar panel detection, including
difficulties with multi-step logical processes, inconsistent output formatting,
frequent misclassification of visually similar objects (e.g., shadows, parking
lots), and low accuracy in complex tasks such as spatial localization and
quantification. To overcome these issues, we propose the PV Assessment with
LLMs (PVAL) framework, which incorporates task decomposition for more efficient
workflows, output standardization for consistent and scalable formatting,
few-shot prompting to enhance classification accuracy, and fine-tuning using
curated PV datasets with detailed annotations. PVAL ensures transparency,
scalability, and adaptability across heterogeneous datasets while minimizing
computational overhead. By combining open-source accessibility with robust
methodologies, PVAL establishes an automated and reproducible pipeline for
solar panel detection, paving the way for large-scale renewable energy
integration and optimized grid management.

Abstract: Commercial high-voltage circuit breaker (CB) condition monitoring systems
rely on directly observable physical parameters such as gas filling pressure
with pre-defined thresholds. While these parameters are crucial, they only
cover a small subset of malfunctioning mechanisms and usually can be monitored
only if the CB is disconnected from the grid. To facilitate online condition
monitoring while CBs remain connected, non-intrusive measurement techniques
such as vibration or acoustic signals are necessary. Currently, CB condition
monitoring studies using these signals typically utilize supervised methods for
fault diagnostics, where ground-truth fault types are known due to artificially
introduced faults in laboratory settings. This supervised approach is however
not feasible in real-world applications, where fault labels are unavailable. In
this work, we propose a novel unsupervised fault detection and segmentation
framework for CBs based on vibration and acoustic signals. This framework can
detect deviations from the healthy state. The explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) approach is applied to the detected faults for fault
diagnostics. The specific contributions are: (1) we propose an integrated
unsupervised fault detection and segmentation framework that is capable of
detecting faults and clustering different faults with only healthy data
required during training (2) we provide an unsupervised explainability-guided
fault diagnostics approach using XAI to offer domain experts potential
indications of the aged or faulty components, achieving fault diagnostics
without the prerequisite of ground-truth fault labels. These contributions are
validated using an experimental dataset from a high-voltage CB under healthy
and artificially introduced fault conditions, contributing to more reliable CB
system operation.

TL;DR: 研究通过自动咳嗽分析作为非小细胞肺癌（NSCLC）的预筛查工具，使用机器学习和深度学习技术，发现CNN表现最佳，但SVM在低算力环境下适用。模型透明度和公平性分析显示需更大、更多样化的数据集。


<details>

Motivation: 早期检测NSCLC对改善患者预后至关重要，需要新方法辅助早期诊断。

Method: 收集227名受试者的咳嗽录音，使用SVM、XGBoost、CNN和VGG16等算法分析，并利用SHAP增强模型可解释性。

Result: CNN测试集准确率0.83，SVM稍低（验证集0.76，测试集0.78）。公平性分析显示年龄差异（0.15）略高于性别差异（0.09）。

Conclusion: 需更大、更多样化的数据集验证结果，尤其是高风险和早期NSCLC患者。

Abstract: Early detection of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is critical for
improving patient outcomes, and novel approaches are needed to facilitate early
diagnosis. In this study, we explore the use of automatic cough analysis as a
pre-screening tool for distinguishing between NSCLC patients and healthy
controls. Cough audio recordings were prospectively acquired from a total of
227 subjects, divided into NSCLC patients and healthy controls. The recordings
were analyzed using machine learning techniques, such as support vector machine
(SVM) and XGBoost, as well as deep learning approaches, specifically
convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transfer learning with VGG16. To
enhance the interpretability of the machine learning model, we utilized Shapley
Additive Explanations (SHAP). The fairness of the models across demographic
groups was assessed by comparing the performance of the best model across
different age groups (less than or equal to 58y and higher than 58y) and gender
using the equalized odds difference on the test set. The results demonstrate
that CNN achieves the best performance, with an accuracy of 0.83 on the test
set. Nevertheless, SVM achieves slightly lower performances (accuracy of 0.76
in validation and 0.78 in the test set), making it suitable in contexts with
low computational power. The use of SHAP for SVM interpretation further
enhances model transparency, making it more trustworthy for clinical
applications. Fairness analysis shows slightly higher disparity across age
(0.15) than gender (0.09) on the test set. Therefore, to strengthen our
findings' reliability, a larger, more diverse, and unbiased dataset is needed
-- particularly including individuals at risk of NSCLC and those in early
disease stages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模拟方法计算成本高且难以扩展，而现有学习方法未能充分利用输入层的差异性。

Method: 提出Weakness-Aware Channel Attention (WACA)机制，通过两阶段门控策略动态调整特征通道的重要性，并结合ConvNeXtV2-based attention U-Net实现自适应特征表示。

Result: 在ICCAD-2023基准测试中，平均绝对误差降低61.1%，F1分数提升71.0%，优于竞赛冠军方法。

Conclusion: 通道间异质性是VLSI物理布局分析的关键归纳偏置，WACA机制为相关任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate spatial prediction of power integrity issues, such as IR drop, is
critical for reliable VLSI design. However, traditional simulation-based
solvers are computationally expensive and difficult to scale. We address this
challenge by reformulating IR drop estimation as a pixel-wise regression task
on heterogeneous multi-channel physical maps derived from circuit layouts.
Prior learning-based methods treat all input layers (e.g., metal, via, and
current maps) equally, ignoring their varying importance to prediction
accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a novel Weakness-Aware Channel Attention
(WACA) mechanism, which recursively enhances weak feature channels while
suppressing over-dominant ones through a two-stage gating strategy. Integrated
into a ConvNeXtV2-based attention U-Net, our approach enables adaptive and
balanced feature representation. On the public ICCAD-2023 benchmark, our method
outperforms the ICCAD-2023 contest winner by reducing mean absolute error by
61.1% and improving F1-score by 71.0%. These results demonstrate that
channel-wise heterogeneity is a key inductive bias in physical layout analysis
for VLSI.

Motivation: 解决静态机器学习模型在高堆积条件下性能下降及通用图神经网络忽略领域结构的问题。

Method: 采用四种图构建策略（如站点为节点、特征为节点等）结合新型消息传递层和领域特定损失函数。

Result: 在CMS触发数据集上验证，某配置达到0.8525的MAE，参数减少55%以上。

Conclusion: 物理引导的图神经网络在资源受限的触发系统中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Real-time particle transverse momentum ($p_T$) estimation in high-energy
physics demands algorithms that are both efficient and accurate under strict
hardware constraints. Static machine learning models degrade under high pileup
and lack physics-aware optimization, while generic graph neural networks (GNNs)
often neglect domain structure critical for robust $p_T$ regression. We propose
a physics-informed GNN framework that systematically encodes detector geometry
and physical observables through four distinct graph construction strategies
that systematically encode detector geometry and physical observables:
station-as-node, feature-as-node, bending angle-centric, and pseudorapidity
($\eta$)-centric representations. This framework integrates these tailored
graph structures with a novel Message Passing Layer (MPL), featuring
intra-message attention and gated updates, and domain-specific loss functions
incorporating $p_{T}$-distribution priors. Our co-design methodology yields
superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to existing baselines.
Extensive experiments on the CMS Trigger Dataset validate the approach: a
station-informed EdgeConv model achieves a state-of-the-art MAE of 0.8525 with
$\ge55\%$ fewer parameters than deep learning baselines, especially TabNet,
while an $\eta$-centric MPL configuration also demonstrates improved accuracy
with comparable efficiency. These results establish the promise of
physics-guided GNNs for deployment in resource-constrained trigger systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型在合成表格数据时难以保留特征间的功能依赖和逻辑依赖，影响了数据的结构保真度和下游应用效果。

Method: 提出HFGF框架，先通过标准生成模型生成独立特征，再根据预定义的FD和LD规则重构依赖特征。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，HFGF显著提升了六种生成模型（如CTGAN、TVAE等）对FDs和LDs的保留能力。

Conclusion: HFGF能显著提升合成表格数据的结构保真度和下游效用。

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is increasingly used in privacy-sensitive domains such
as health care, but existing generative models often fail to preserve
inter-attribute relationships. In particular, functional dependencies (FDs) and
logical dependencies (LDs), which capture deterministic and rule-based
associations between features, are rarely or often poorly retained in synthetic
datasets. To address this research gap, we propose the Hierarchical Feature
Generation Framework (HFGF) for synthetic tabular data generation. We created
benchmark datasets with known dependencies to evaluate our proposed HFGF. The
framework first generates independent features using any standard generative
model, and then reconstructs dependent features based on predefined FD and LD
rules. Our experiments on four benchmark datasets with varying sizes, feature
imbalance, and dependency complexity demonstrate that HFGF improves the
preservation of FDs and LDs across six generative models, including CTGAN,
TVAE, and GReaT. Our findings demonstrate that HFGF can significantly enhance
the structural fidelity and downstream utility of synthetic tabular data.

Motivation: 传统CFD模拟计算量大，难以集成到实时或设计迭代流程中，因此需要一种高效且准确的替代方法。

Method: 使用三个神经网络：CAER提取和压缩流特征，MLP将入口速度映射到潜在表示，CNN作为聚合器将单入口特征组合为双入口场景。

Result: CBML模型在训练和测试数据集中均能快速准确地预测双组分聚合速度和温度场。

Conclusion: CBML方法为室内气流和温度分布的快速预测提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient prediction of indoor airflow and temperature
distributions is essential for building energy optimization and occupant
comfort control. However, traditional CFD simulations are computationally
intensive, limiting their integration into real-time or design-iterative
workflows. This study proposes a component-based machine learning (CBML)
surrogate modeling approach to replace conventional CFD simulation for fast
prediction of indoor velocity and temperature fields. The model consists of
three neural networks: a convolutional autoencoder with residual connections
(CAER) to extract and compress flow features, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to
map inlet velocities to latent representations, and a convolutional neural
network (CNN) as an aggregator to combine single-inlet features into dual-inlet
scenarios. A two-dimensional room with varying left and right air inlet
velocities is used as a benchmark case, with CFD simulations providing training
and testing data. Results show that the CBML model accurately and fast predicts
two-component aggregated velocity and temperature fields across both training
and testing datasets.

Conclusion: NLL训练通过隐式学习几何结构空间，揭示了现代语言模型有效性的深层结构原理。

Abstract: Auto-regressive language models factorize sequence probabilities and are
trained by minimizing the negative log-likelihood (NLL) objective. While
empirically powerful, a deep theoretical understanding of why this simple
objective yields such versatile representations remains elusive. This work
introduces a unifying analytical framework using Markov Categories (MCs) to
deconstruct the AR generation process and the NLL objective. We model the
single-step generation map as a composition of Markov kernels in the category
Stoch. This compositional view, when enriched with statistical divergences,
allows us to dissect information flow and learned geometry. Our framework makes
three main contributions. First, we provide a formal, information-theoretic
rationale for the success of modern speculative decoding methods like EAGLE,
quantifying the information surplus in hidden states that these methods
exploit. Second, we formalize how NLL minimization forces the model to learn
not just the next token, but the data's intrinsic conditional stochasticity, a
process we analyze using categorical entropy. Third, and most centrally, we
prove that NLL training acts as an implicit form of spectral contrastive
learning. By analyzing the information geometry of the model's prediction head,
we show that NLL implicitly forces the learned representation space to align
with the eigenspectrum of a predictive similarity operator, thereby learning a
geometrically structured space without explicit contrastive pairs. This
compositional and information-geometric perspective reveals the deep structural
principles underlying the effectiveness of modern LMs. Project Page:

Method: 利用LLM诱导的稀疏依赖图，将特征视为节点，通过遍历图合成数据，并探索了两种合成策略：非参数高斯核密度估计和条件归一化流模型。

Conclusion: SPADA通过稀疏依赖建模，显著提升了表格数据增强的质量和效率。

Abstract: Tabular data is critical across diverse domains, yet high-quality datasets
remain scarce due to privacy concerns and the cost of collection. Contemporary
approaches adopt large language models (LLMs) for tabular augmentation, but
exhibit two major limitations: (1) dense dependency modeling among tabular
features that can introduce bias, and (2) high computational overhead in
sampling. To address these issues, we propose SPADA for SPArse
Dependency-driven Augmentation, a lightweight generative framework that
explicitly captures sparse dependencies via an LLM-induced graph. We treat each
feature as a node and synthesize values by traversing the graph, conditioning
each feature solely on its parent nodes. We explore two synthesis strategies: a
non-parametric method using Gaussian kernel density estimation, and a
conditional normalizing flow model that learns invertible mappings for
conditional density estimation. Experiments on four datasets show that SPADA
reduces constraint violations by 4% compared to diffusion-based methods and
accelerates generation by nearly 9,500 times over LLM-based baselines.

Abstract: In recent years, social media users have spent significant amounts of time on
short-form video platforms. As a result, established platforms in other
domains, such as e-commerce, have begun introducing short-form video content to
engage users and increase their time spent on the platform. The success of
these experiences is due not only to the content itself but also to a unique UI
innovation: instead of offering users a list of choices to click, platforms
actively recommend content for users to watch one at a time. This creates new
challenges for recommender systems, especially when launching a new video
experience. Beyond the limited interaction data, immersive feed experiences
introduce stronger position bias due to the UI and duration bias when
optimizing for watch-time, as models tend to favor shorter videos. These
issues, together with the feedback loop inherent in recommender systems, make
it difficult to build effective solutions. In this paper, we highlight the
challenges faced when introducing a new short-form video experience and present
our experience showing that, even with sufficient video interaction data, it
can be more beneficial to leverage a video retrieval system using a fine-tuned
multimodal vision-language model to overcome these challenges. This approach
demonstrated greater effectiveness compared to conventional supervised learning
methods in online experiments conducted on our e-commerce platform.

Conclusion: GENEOs为6G网络中的信号重建提供了一种高效且低复杂度的解决方案，尤其在数据稀缺情况下表现优异。

Abstract: In emerging communication systems such as sixth generation (6G) wireless
networks, efficient resource management and service delivery rely on accurate
knowledge of spatially-varying quantities like signal-to-interference-noise
ratio (SINR) maps, which are costly to acquire at high resolution. This work
explores the reconstruction of such spatial signals from sparse measurements
using Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs), offering a
low-complexity alternative to traditional neural networks. The concept of
GENEO, which originated in topological data analysis (TDA), is a mathematical
tool used in machine learning to represent agents modelled as functional
operators acting on data while incorporating application-specific invariances.
Leveraging these invariances reduces the number of parameters with respect to
traditional neural networks and mitigates data scarcity by enforcing known
algebraic and geometric constraints that reflect symmetries in the agents'
actions. In this paper, we introduce a novel GENEO-based approach for SINR map
reconstruction in urban wireless communication networks using extremely sparse
sampling. We demonstrate that this mathematical framework achieves competitive
performance compared to established methods. Our evaluation, conducted using
both statistical and TDA metrics, highlights the advantages of our approach in
accurately reconstructing spatial signals under severe data limitations on the
number of samples.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is increasingly leveraged across various domains to
automate decision-making processes that significantly impact human lives. In
medical image analysis, deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable
performance. However, their inherent complexity makes them black box systems,
raising concerns about reliability and interpretability. Counterfactual
explanations provide comprehensible insights into decision processes by
presenting hypothetical "what-if" scenarios that alter model classifications.
By examining input alterations, counterfactual explanations provide patterns
that influence the decision-making process. Despite their potential, generating
plausible counterfactuals that adhere to similarity constraints providing
human-interpretable explanations remains a challenge. In this paper, we
investigate this challenge by a model-specific optimization approach. While
deep generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) exhibit
significant generative power, probabilistic models like sum-product networks
(SPNs) efficiently represent complex joint probability distributions. By
modeling the likelihood of a semi-supervised VAE's latent space with an SPN, we
leverage its dual role as both a latent space descriptor and a classifier for a
given discrimination task. This formulation enables the optimization of latent
space counterfactuals that are both close to the original data distribution and
aligned with the target class distribution. We conduct experimental evaluation
on the cheXpert dataset. To evaluate the effectiveness of the integration of
SPNs, our SPN-guided latent space manipulation is compared against a neural
network baseline. Additionally, the trade-off between latent variable
regularization and counterfactual quality is analyzed.

Abstract: The increasing complexity and volume of financial transactions pose
significant challenges to traditional fraud detection systems. This technical
report investigates and compares the efficacy of classical, quantum, and
quantum-hybrid machine learning models for the binary classification of
fraudulent financial activities.
  As of our methodology, first, we develop a comprehensive behavioural feature
engineering framework to transform raw transactional data into a rich,
descriptive feature set. Second, we implement and evaluate a range of models on
the IBM Anti-Money Laundering (AML) dataset. The classical baseline models
include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. These
are compared against three hybrid classic quantum algorithms architectures: a
Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM), a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC),
and a Hybrid Quantum Neural Network (HQNN).
  Furthermore, we propose Fraud Detection for Quantum Computing (FD4QC), a
practical, API-driven system architecture designed for real-world deployment,
featuring a classical-first, quantum-enhanced philosophy with robust fallback
mechanisms.
  Our results demonstrate that classical tree-based models, particularly
\textit{Random Forest}, significantly outperform the quantum counterparts in
the current setup, achieving high accuracy (\(97.34\%\)) and F-measure
(\(86.95\%\)). Among the quantum models, \textbf{QSVM} shows the most promise,
delivering high precision (\(77.15\%\)) and a low false-positive rate
(\(1.36\%\)), albeit with lower recall and significant computational overhead.
  This report provides a benchmark for a real-world financial application,
highlights the current limitations of quantum machine learning in this domain,

Abstract: Model multiplicity refers to the existence of multiple machine learning
models that describe the data equally well but may produce different
predictions on individual samples. In medicine, these models can admit
conflicting predictions for the same patient -- a risk that is poorly
understood and insufficiently addressed.
  In this study, we empirically analyze the extent, drivers, and ramifications
of predictive multiplicity across diverse medical tasks and model
architectures, and show that even small ensembles can mitigate/eliminate
predictive multiplicity in practice. Our analysis reveals that (1) standard
validation metrics fail to identify a uniquely optimal model and (2) a
substantial amount of predictions hinges on arbitrary choices made during model
development. Using multiple models instead of a single model reveals instances
where predictions differ across equally plausible models -- highlighting
patients that would receive arbitrary diagnoses if any single model were used.
In contrast, (3) a small ensemble paired with an abstention strategy can
effectively mitigate measurable predictive multiplicity in practice;
predictions with high inter-model consensus may thus be amenable to automated
classification. While accuracy is not a principled antidote to predictive
multiplicity, we find that (4) higher accuracy achieved through increased model
capacity reduces predictive multiplicity.
  Our findings underscore the clinical importance of accounting for model
multiplicity and advocate for ensemble-based strategies to improve diagnostic
reliability. In cases where models fail to reach sufficient consensus, we
recommend deferring decisions to expert review.

Abstract: Many recent papers have studied the development of superforecaster-level
event forecasting LLMs. While methodological problems with early studies cast
doubt on the use of LLMs for event forecasting, recent studies with improved
evaluation methods have shown that state-of-the-art LLMs are gradually reaching
superforecaster-level performance, and reinforcement learning has also been
reported to improve future forecasting. Additionally, the unprecedented success
of recent reasoning models and Deep Research-style models suggests that
technology capable of greatly improving forecasting performance has been
developed. Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the
time is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level
event forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training
methods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three
difficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity,
knowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present
related ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks,
utilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward
signals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling
datasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation. Finally, we explain how
these technical advances could enable AI to provide predictive intelligence to
society in broader areas. This position paper presents promising specific paths
and considerations for getting closer to superforecaster-level AI technology,
aiming to call for researchers' interest in these directions.

TL;DR: SILS框架通过动态、影响导向的方法识别高影响力流动性提供者（LPs），取代了传统的静态、基于规模的分析方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖名义资本规模或表面活动，导致风险分析不准确，SILS旨在提供更精确的LP影响力评估。

Method: 利用链上事件日志和智能合约执行痕迹计算指数时间加权流动性（ETWL）轮廓，并应用无监督异常检测，定义流动性稳定性影响分数（LSIS）。

Result: SILS能更准确地识别高影响力LPs，减少误报和漏报，支持保护性预言机层和交易信号等应用。

Conclusion: SILS为DeFi协议提供了主动风险管理机制，显著提升生态系统对不对称流动性行为的防护能力。

Abstract: Traditional methods for identifying impactful liquidity providers (LPs) in
Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers (CLMMs) rely on broad measures, such as
nominal capital size or surface-level activity, which often lead to inaccurate
risk analysis. The SILS framework offers a significantly more detailed
approach, characterizing LPs not just as capital holders but as dynamic
systemic agents whose actions directly impact market stability. This represents
a fundamental paradigm shift from the static, volume-based analysis to a
dynamic, impact-focused understanding. This advanced approach uses on-chain
event logs and smart contract execution traces to compute Exponential
Time-Weighted Liquidity (ETWL) profiles and apply unsupervised anomaly
detection. Most importantly, it defines an LP's functional importance through
the Liquidity Stability Impact Score (LSIS), a counterfactual metric that
measures the potential degradation of the market if the LP withdraws. This
combined approach provides a more detailed and realistic characterization of an
LP's impact, moving beyond the binary and often misleading classifications used
by existing methods. This impact-focused and comprehensive approach enables
SILS to accurately identify high-impact LPs-including those missed by
traditional methods and supports essential applications like a protective
oracle layer and actionable trader signals, thereby significantly enhancing
DeFi ecosystem. The framework provides unprecedented transparency into the
underlying liquidity structure and associated risks, effectively reducing the
common false positives and uncovering critical false negatives found in
traditional models. Therefore, SILS provides an effective mechanism for
proactive risk management, transforming how DeFi protocols safeguard their
ecosystems against asymmetric liquidity behavior.

TL;DR: Step-3是一种硬件感知的模型-系统协同设计，通过多矩阵分解注意力机制和注意力-FFN解耦系统，显著降低解码成本，提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在解码过程中硬件效率低下的问题，尤其是长上下文推理任务。

Method: 采用多矩阵分解注意力机制（MFA）减少KV缓存和计算量，同时保持注意力表达能力；引入注意力-FFN解耦系统（AFD）优化分布式推理。

Result: Step-3显著降低了解码成本，在Hopper GPU上实现每秒4039个令牌的解码吞吐量，优于DeepSeek-V3。

Conclusion: 硬件对齐的注意力算术强度、MoE稀疏性和AFD是提升成本效益的关键，Step-3为LLM解码设定了新的帕累托前沿。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face low hardware efficiency during decoding,
especially for long-context reasoning tasks. This paper introduces Step-3, a
321B-parameter VLM with hardware-aware model-system co-design optimized for
minimizing decoding costs. Step-3 innovates in two key dimensions: (1) A novel
Multi-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) mechanism that significantly reduces
both KV cache size and computation while maintaining high attention
expressiveness, and (2) Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD), a distributed
inference system that decouples attention and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers
into specialized subsystems. This co-design achieves unprecedented cost
efficiency: Step-3 significantly reduces theoretical decoding costs compared
with models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B, with the gains widening at
longer context. Step-3 achieves low cost while activating 38B parameters per
token (more than DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B), demonstrating that
hardware-aligned attention arithmetic intensity, MoE sparsity, and AFD are
critical to cost-effectiveness. We perform a head-to-head comparison with
DeepSeek-V3 in its favorable scenarios. Our implementation on Hopper GPUs
achieves a decoding throughput of up to 4,039 tokens per second per GPU under
50ms TPOT SLA (4K context, FP8, no MTP). It is higher than DeepSeek-V3's 2,324
in the same setup and sets a new Pareto frontier for LLM decoding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习代理在训练范围之外部署时捕捉潜在变化（上下文）的问题。

Method: 提出双推理控制问题，定义观察充分性和控制充分性，推导上下文ELBO目标，并开发BCPO算法。

Result: 在连续控制基准测试中，BCPO表现优于其他基线方法，样本效率更高且泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: 该框架统一了基于上下文的强化学习的理论、诊断和实践。

Abstract: Capturing latent variations ("contexts") is key to deploying
reinforcement-learning (RL) agents beyond their training regime. We recast
context-based RL as a dual inference-control problem and formally characterize
two properties and their hierarchy: observation sufficiency (preserving all
predictive information) and control sufficiency (retaining decision-making
relevant information). Exploiting this dichotomy, we derive a contextual
evidence lower bound(ELBO)-style objective that cleanly separates
representation learning from policy learning and optimizes it with Bottlenecked
Contextual Policy Optimization (BCPO), an algorithm that places a variational
information-bottleneck encoder in front of any off-policy policy learner. On
standard continuous-control benchmarks with shifting physical parameters, BCPO
matches or surpasses other baselines while using fewer samples and retaining
performance far outside the training regime. The framework unifies theory,
diagnostics, and practice for context-based RL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Forest-Guided Clustering (FGC) 是一种针对随机森林（RF）的可解释性方法，通过分组实例揭示局部和全局结构，提供与模型内部逻辑一致的可解释聚类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型在敏感领域的应用增加，对可解释和可信决策的需求上升。随机森林虽然性能强大，但因其集成特性难以解释。

Method: FGC 通过根据共享决策路径分组实例，生成与模型逻辑一致的可解释聚类，并计算聚类特定和全局特征重要性得分。

Result: FGC 在基准数据集上准确恢复潜在子类结构，优于传统聚类和后解释方法；在 AML 转录组数据中揭示生物学相关亚群。

Conclusion: FGC 在性能和可解释性之间架起桥梁，提供超越特征级别归因的结构感知洞察。

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly deployed in sensitive application
areas, the demand for interpretable and trustworthy decision-making has
increased. Random Forests (RF), despite their widespread use and strong
performance on tabular data, remain difficult to interpret due to their
ensemble nature. We present Forest-Guided Clustering (FGC), a model-specific
explainability method that reveals both local and global structure in RFs by
grouping instances according to shared decision paths. FGC produces
human-interpretable clusters aligned with the model's internal logic and
computes cluster-specific and global feature importance scores to derive
decision rules underlying RF predictions. FGC accurately recovered latent
subclass structure on a benchmark dataset and outperformed classical clustering
and post-hoc explanation methods. Applied to an AML transcriptomic dataset, FGC
uncovered biologically coherent subpopulations, disentangled disease-relevant
signals from confounders, and recovered known and novel gene expression
patterns. FGC bridges the gap between performance and interpretability by
providing structure-aware insights that go beyond feature-level attribution.

Motivation: 为Alpay代数提供理论基础，验证语义收敛的哲学主张，并为无限自引用系统提供形式化工具。

Method: 结合固定点定理、序论连续性和依赖类型理论，通过迭代和验证实现形式化证明。

Result: 证明了迭代对话的稳定性和唯一性，并提供了机器验证的证明。

Conclusion: 研究为无限自引用系统的推理和计算环境中的收敛验证提供了严格的理论基础。

Abstract: This paper contributes to the Alpay Algebra by demonstrating that the stable
outcome of a self referential process, obtained by iterating a transformation
through all ordinal stages, is identical to the unique equilibrium of an
unbounded revision dialogue between a system and its environment. The analysis
initially elucidates how classical fixed point theorems guarantee such
convergence in finite settings and subsequently extends the argument to the
transfinite domain, relying upon well founded induction and principles of order
theoretic continuity.
  Furthermore, the resulting transordinal fixed point operator is embedded into
dependent type theory, a formalization which permits every step of the
transfinite iteration and its limit to be verified within a modern proof
assistant. This procedure yields a machine checked proof that the iterative
dialogue necessarily stabilizes and that its limit is unique. The result
provides a foundation for Alpay's philosophical claim of semantic convergence
within the framework of constructive logic. By unifying concepts from fixed
point theory, game semantics, ordinal analysis, and type theory, this research
establishes a broadly accessible yet formally rigorous foundation for reasoning
about infinite self referential systems and offers practical tools for
certifying their convergence within computational environments.

Motivation: 探索活性极性流体中拓扑缺陷的复杂动力学，以及如何通过反馈控制实现动态状态之间的转换。

Method: 使用连续流体动力学模型和强化学习框架，通过局部调控活性应力来引导缺陷的运动。

Result: 发现通过非线性耦合可以重新定位和引导缺陷沿预定轨迹运动，强化学习能有效发现控制策略。

Conclusion: AI代理可以学习活性物质的动力学并操控拓扑激发，为自适应自组织材料的设计提供新思路。

Abstract: Topological defects in active polar fluids exhibit complex dynamics driven by
internally generated stresses, reflecting the deep interplay between topology,
flow, and non-equilibrium hydrodynamics. Feedback control offers a powerful
means to guide such systems, enabling transitions between dynamic states. We
investigated closed-loop steering of integer-charged defects in a confined
active fluid by modulating the spatial profile of activity. Using a continuum
hydrodynamic model, we show that localized control of active stress induces
flow fields that can reposition and direct defects along prescribed
trajectories by exploiting non-linear couplings in the system. A reinforcement
learning framework is used to discover effective control strategies that
produce robust defect transport across both trained and novel trajectories. The
results highlight how AI agents can learn the underlying dynamics and spatially
structure activity to manipulate topological excitations, offering insights
into the controllability of active matter and the design of adaptive,
self-organized materials.

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合卷积神经网络（CNN）与集合数值天气预报（NWP）模型的方法，用于改进中范围（五天以上）地表温度预报。通过CNN后处理和集合平均，显著减少了系统误差和随机误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于计算资源有限，中范围温度预报通常依赖低分辨率NWP模型，但这些模型存在系统和随机误差。本研究旨在通过CNN和集合平均的结合解决这些问题。

Method: 方法包括：1）对每个集合成员进行CNN后处理（偏差校正和空间超分辨率），从低分辨率输出重建高分辨率温度场；2）通过集合平均减少随机误差。还比较了CNN校正与集合平均的顺序对预报精度的影响。

Result: 结果表明，先进行CNN校正再进行集合平均的方法精度更高。该方法显著优于高分辨率确定性NWP模型，有效减少了系统误差和随机误差。

Conclusion: 该方法为改进中范围温度预报提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案，尤其适用于计算资源有限的操作中心。

Abstract: This study proposes a method that integrates convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) with ensemble numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, enabling
surface temperature forecasting at lead times beyond the short-range (five-day)
forecast period. Owing to limited computational resources, operational
medium-range temperature forecasts typically rely on low-resolution NWP models,
which are prone to systematic and random errors. To resolve these limitations,
the proposed method first reduces systematic errors through CNN-based
post-processing (bias correction and spatial super-resolution) on each ensemble
member, reconstructing high-resolution temperature fields from low-resolution
model outputs. Second, it reduces random errors through ensemble averaging of
the CNN-corrected members. This study also investigates whether the sequence of
CNN correction and ensemble averaging affects the forecast accuracy. For
comparison with the proposed method, we additionally conducted experiments with
the CNN trained on ensemble-averaged forecasts. The first approach--CNN
correction before ensemble averaging--consistently achieved higher accuracy
than the reverse approach. Although based on low-resolution ensemble forecasts,
the proposed method notably outperformed the high-resolution deterministic NWP
models. These findings indicate that combining CNN-based correction with
ensemble averaging effectively reduces both the systematic and random errors in
NWP model outputs. The proposed approach is a practical and scalable solution
for improving medium-range temperature forecasts, and is particularly valuable
at operational centers with limited computational resources.

Method: 使用Anemoi框架，通过最小化调整共享架构，构建并训练LAM和SGM模型，进行多次推理实验比较性能。

Result: LAM和SGM在区域预测性能上相当，但LAM依赖高质量边界数据，SGM更具通用性和易操作性。

Conclusion: LAM适合全球数据获取困难的情境，SGM更适合操作化和通用性需求，为气象机构提供选择指导。

Abstract: Regional machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) models based on graph
neural networks have recently demonstrated remarkable predictive accuracy,
outperforming numerical weather prediction models at lower computational costs.
In particular, limited-area model (LAM) and stretched-grid model (SGM)
approaches have emerged for generating high-resolution regional forecasts,
based on initial conditions from a regional (re)analysis. While LAM uses
lateral boundaries from an external global model, SGM incorporates a global
domain at lower resolution. This study aims to understand how the differences
in model design impact relative performance and potential applications.
Specifically, the strengths and weaknesses of these two approaches are
identified for generating deterministic regional forecasts over Europe. Using
the Anemoi framework, models of both types are built by minimally adapting a
shared architecture and trained using global and regional reanalyses in a
near-identical setup. Several inference experiments have been conducted to
explore their relative performance and highlight key differences. Results show
that both LAM and SGM are competitive deterministic MLWP models with generally
accurate and comparable forecasting performance over the regional domain.
Various differences were identified in the performance of the models across
applications. LAM is able to successfully exploit high-quality boundary
forcings to make predictions within the regional domain and is suitable in
contexts where global data is difficult to acquire. SGM is fully self-contained
for easier operationalisation, can take advantage of more training data and
significantly surpasses LAM in terms of (temporal) generalisability. Our paper
can serve as a starting point for meteorological institutes to guide their
choice between LAM and SGM in developing an operational data-driven forecasting
system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏预测海藻筏质心运动的物理定律，需要机器学习方法辅助预测。

Method: 采用LSTM和SINDy两种方法，基于eBOMB模型，分别学习质心与海洋速度的差异和通过函数库识别显式关系。

Result: LSTM在简单设计下表现最佳，SINDy在稀疏连接筏的数据中通过窗口速度项有效建模非局部相互作用。

Conclusion: LSTM适合简单场景但缺乏透明性，SINDy提供可解释性，尤其在复杂场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Since 2011, rafts of floating \emph{Sargassum} seaweed have frequently
obstructed the coasts of the Intra-Americas Seas. The motion of the rafts is
represented by a high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system. Referred to as
the eBOMB model, this builds on the Maxey--Riley equation by incorporating
interactions between clumps of \emph{Sargassum} forming a raft and the effects
of Earth's rotation. The absence of a predictive law for the rafts' centers of
mass suggests a need for machine learning. In this paper, we evaluate and
contrast Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and
Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy). In both cases, a
physics-inspired closure modeling approach is taken rooted in eBOMB.
Specifically, the LSTM model learns a mapping from a collection of eBOMB
variables to the difference between raft center-of-mass and ocean velocities.
The SINDy model's library of candidate functions is suggested by eBOMB
variables and includes windowed velocity terms incorporating far-field effects
of the carrying flow. Both LSTM and SINDy models perform most effectively in
conditions with tightly bonded clumps, despite declining precision with rising
complexity, such as with wind effects and when assessing loosely connected
clumps. The LSTM model delivered the best results when designs were
straightforward, with fewer neurons and hidden layers. While LSTM model serves
as an opaque black-box model lacking interpretability, the SINDy model brings
transparency by discerning explicit functional relationships through the
function libraries. Integration of the windowed velocity terms enabled
effective modeling of nonlocal interactions, particularly in datasets featuring
sparsely connected rafts.

Motivation: 探索多模态输入在噪声环境中如何提升ASR准确性，以弥补单一模态的不足。

Method: 通过合成和真实数据实验，分析不同模态（如语音、文本、图像）对ASR的影响。

Result: 多模态通常提升ASR准确性，同步模态在高噪声下更有效，非同步模态在中等噪声下更优；高质量视觉表示和模态输入顺序对结果有显著影响。

Conclusion: 多模态在噪声环境下对ASR有显著帮助，需优化模态选择和模型架构。

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new
possibilities for unified modeling of speech, text, images, and other
modalities. Building on our prior work, this paper examines the conditions and
model architectures under which multiple input modalities can improve automatic
speech recognition (ASR) accuracy in noisy environments. Through experiments on
synthetic and real-world data, we find that (1) harnessing more modalities
usually improves ASR accuracy, as each modality provides complementary
information, but the improvement depends on the amount of auditory noise. (2)
Synchronized modalities (e.g., lip movements) are more useful at high noise
levels whereas unsynchronized modalities (e.g., image context) are most helpful
at moderate noise levels. (3) Higher-quality visual representations
consistently improve ASR accuracy, highlighting the importance of developing
more powerful visual encoders. (4) Mamba exhibits similar trends regarding the
benefits of multimodality as do Transformers. (5) The input order of modalities
as well as their weights in the loss function can significantly impact
accuracy. These findings both offer practical insights and help to deepen our
understanding of multi-modal speech recognition under challenging conditions.

high-time-dimensional codecs pose significant challenges. In this paper, we
introduce HH-Codec, a neural codec that achieves extreme compression at 24
tokens per second for 24 kHz audio while relying on single-quantizer inference.
Our approach involves a carefully designed Vector Quantization space for Spoken
Language Modeling, optimizing compression efficiency while minimizing
information loss. Building on this, we propose an asymmetric encoder-decoder
architecture (Audio-VQ-Mel-Audio) that leverages dual supervision and
progressive training to enhance reconstruction stability and fidelity. HH-Codec
achieves state-of-the-art performance in speech reconstruction with an
ultra-low bandwidth of 0.3 kbps. We further evaluate its effectiveness in
codebook utilization and generative model adaptation, with extensive ablations
validating the necessity of each module. HH-Codec is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的音频重合成技术，通过在潜在向量层面重构颗粒合成的概念，无需模型训练即可实现目标音频与源音频特征的融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统拼接合成中的不连续性问题，同时支持多样化的音频材料处理。

Method: 通过编码源音频为潜在向量段创建“颗粒码本”，匹配目标音频的潜在颗粒并解码生成混合音频。

Result: 生成的音频保留了目标的时间结构，同时具有源音频的音色特征，避免了传统方法的不连续性。

Conclusion: 该技术为音频重合成提供了一种高效且灵活的方法，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: We introduce a novel technique for creative audio resynthesis that operates
by reworking the concept of granular synthesis at the latent vector level. Our
approach creates a "granular codebook" by encoding a source audio corpus into
latent vector segments, then matches each latent grain of a target audio signal
to its closest counterpart in the codebook. The resulting hybrid sequence is
decoded to produce audio that preserves the target's temporal structure while
adopting the source's timbral characteristics. This technique requires no model
training, works with diverse audio materials, and naturally avoids the
discontinuities typical of traditional concatenative synthesis through the
codec's implicit interpolation during decoding. We include supplementary
material at https://github.com/naotokui/latentgranular/ , as well as a
proof-of-concept implementation to allow users to experiment with their own
sounds at https://huggingface.co/spaces/naotokui/latentgranular .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音驱动面部动画生成方法依赖固定语音，限制了应用（如面部与语音不匹配）。因此，研究扩展任务至更具挑战性的场景：根据面部图像和文本生成同步的语音和动画。

Method: 提出Face2VoiceSync框架，包括语音-面部对齐、多样性控制、高效训练（轻量VAE桥接视觉与音频预训练模型）和新评估指标。

Result: 实验表明，Face2VoiceSync在单块40GB GPU上实现了视觉和音频的最先进性能。

Conclusion: Face2VoiceSync解决了语音与面部动画同步生成的挑战，为更广泛的应用提供了可能。

Abstract: Recent studies in speech-driven talking face generation achieve promising
results, but their reliance on fixed-driven speech limits further applications
(e.g., face-voice mismatch). Thus, we extend the task to a more challenging
setting: given a face image and text to speak, generating both talking face
animation and its corresponding speeches. Accordingly, we propose a novel
framework, Face2VoiceSync, with several novel contributions: 1) Voice-Face
Alignment, ensuring generated voices match facial appearance; 2) Diversity \&
Manipulation, enabling generated voice control over paralinguistic features
space; 3) Efficient Training, using a lightweight VAE to bridge visual and
audio large-pretrained models, with significantly fewer trainable parameters
than existing methods; 4) New Evaluation Metric, fairly assessing the diversity
and identity consistency. Experiments show Face2VoiceSync achieves both visual
and audio state-of-the-art performances on a single 40GB GPU.

### [206] [Distilling a Small Utility-Based Passage Selector to Enhance Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19102)
*Hengran Zhang,Keping Bi,Jiafeng Guo,Jiaming Zhang,Shuaiqiang Wang,Dawei Yin,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将大语言模型（LLM）的效用判断能力蒸馏到更小、更高效模型中的方法，以解决RAG中基于效用的检索计算成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在RAG中，基于效用的检索虽然能提高答案质量，但使用LLM进行效用判断的计算成本过高，限制了评估的段落数量，尤其是对复杂查询。

Method: 通过训练学生模型从教师LLM学习伪答案生成和效用判断，采用滑动窗口方法动态选择有用段落，实现效用驱动的段落选择。

Result: 实验表明，基于效用的选择显著降低了计算成本，同时提高了答案质量，尤其在复杂问题上优于基于相关性的排序。

Conclusion: 效用驱动的段落选择为RAG提供了灵活且经济的解决方案，支持复杂查询的高效处理。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
incorporating retrieved information. Standard retrieval process prioritized
relevance, focusing on topical alignment between queries and passages. In
contrast, in RAG, the emphasis has shifted to utility, which considers the
usefulness of passages for generating accurate answers. Despite empirical
evidence showing the benefits of utility-based retrieval in RAG, the high
computational cost of using LLMs for utility judgments limits the number of
passages evaluated. This restriction is problematic for complex queries
requiring extensive information. To address this, we propose a method to
distill the utility judgment capabilities of LLMs into smaller, more efficient
models. Our approach focuses on utility-based selection rather than ranking,
enabling dynamic passage selection tailored to specific queries without the
need for fixed thresholds. We train student models to learn pseudo-answer
generation and utility judgments from teacher LLMs, using a sliding window
method that dynamically selects useful passages. Our experiments demonstrate
that utility-based selection provides a flexible and cost-effective solution
for RAG, significantly reducing computational costs while improving answer
quality. We present the distillation results using Qwen3-32B as the teacher
model for both relevance ranking and utility-based selection, distilled into
RankQwen1.7B and UtilityQwen1.7B. Our findings indicate that for complex
questions, utility-based selection is more effective than relevance ranking in
enhancing answer generation performance. We will release the relevance ranking
and utility-based selection annotations for the MS MARCO dataset, supporting
further research in this area.

TL;DR: Passage Injection方法通过将检索到的段落显式融入LLMs的推理过程，显著提升了RAG系统的性能和抗噪能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统在知识密集型任务中表现优异，但检索到的低质量段落（噪声）会削弱其效果。提升LLMs对噪声的鲁棒性是提高RAG可靠性的关键。

Method: 提出Passage Injection方法，将检索到的段落显式融入LLMs的推理过程，增强模型识别和抵抗噪声的能力。

Result: 在四个事实QA数据集上的实验表明，Passage Injection显著提升了RAG性能，并在随机噪声和误导性噪声场景下均表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 将检索段落融入LLMs的推理过程是构建更鲁棒RAG系统的有效方向。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to augment large
language models (LLMs) with external knowledge for knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, its effectiveness is often undermined by the presence of noisy (i.e.,
low-quality) retrieved passages. Enhancing LLMs' robustness to such noise is
critical for improving the reliability of RAG systems. Recent advances have
equipped LLMs with strong reasoning and self-reflection capabilities, allowing
them to identify and correct errors in their reasoning process. Inspired by
this ability, we propose Passage Injection-a simple yet effective method that
explicitly incorporates retrieved passages into LLMs' reasoning process, aiming
to enhance the model's ability to recognize and resist noisy passages. We
validate Passage Injection under general RAG settings using BM25 as the
retriever. Experiments on four reasoning-enhanced LLMs across four factual QA
datasets demonstrate that Passage Injection significantly improves overall RAG
performance. Further analysis on two noisy retrieval settings-random noise,
where the model is provided irrelevant passages, and counterfactual noise,
where it is given misleading passages-shows that Passage Injection consistently
improves robustness. Controlled experiments confirm that Passage Injection can
also effectively leverage helpful passages. These findings suggest that
incorporating passages in LLMs' reasoning process is a promising direction for
building more robust RAG systems. The code can be found

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PBiLoss的损失函数，通过正则化方法减少基于图的推荐系统中的流行度偏差，同时保持推荐准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GNN的推荐系统容易受到流行度偏差的影响，导致内容多样性减少和公平性受损。

Method: 设计了PBiLoss损失函数，结合两种采样策略（PopPos和PopNeg）和两种流行度区分方法，可灵活集成到现有框架中。

Result: 实验表明，PBiLoss显著提高了公平性（降低PRU和PRI），同时保持或提升推荐准确性。

Conclusion: PBiLoss通过直接嵌入公平性目标，为现代推荐系统提供了一种平衡准确性和公平性的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recommender systems, especially those based on graph neural networks (GNNs),
have achieved remarkable success in capturing user-item interaction patterns.
However, they remain susceptible to popularity bias--the tendency to
over-recommend popular items--resulting in reduced content diversity and
compromised fairness. In this paper, we propose PBiLoss, a novel
regularization-based loss function designed to counteract popularity bias in
graph-based recommender models explicitly. PBiLoss augments traditional
training objectives by penalizing the model's inclination toward popular items,
thereby encouraging the recommendation of less popular but potentially more
personalized content. We introduce two sampling strategies: Popular Positive
(PopPos) and Popular Negative (PopNeg), which respectively modulate the
contribution of the positive and negative popular items during training. We
further explore two methods to distinguish popular items: one based on a fixed
popularity threshold and another without any threshold, making the approach
flexible and adaptive. Our proposed method is model-agnostic and can be
seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art graph-based frameworks such as
LightGCN and its variants. Comprehensive experiments across multiple real-world
datasets demonstrate that PBiLoss significantly improves fairness, as
demonstrated by reductions in the Popularity-Rank Correlation for Users (PRU)
and Popularity-Rank Correlation for Items (PRI), while maintaining or even
enhancing standard recommendation accuracy and ranking metrics. These results
highlight the effectiveness of directly embedding fairness objectives into the
optimization process, providing a practical and scalable solution for balancing
accuracy and equitable content exposure in modern recommender systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少推荐系统中每个项目的唯一嵌入对内存的占用，同时提升推荐准确性和多样性。

Method: 使用共享的内容特征（'语义ID'）替代唯一嵌入，以减少内存需求并允许增加模型复杂度。

Result: 在两个音乐推荐数据集上，包括在线A/B测试，展示了共享嵌入在提升准确性和多样性、减小模型大小方面的优势。

Conclusion: 共享内容特征是一种有效的方法，可以在减少模型大小的同时提升推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Training recommender systems for next-item recommendation often requires
unique embeddings to be learned for each item, which may take up most of the
trainable parameters for a model. Shared embeddings, such as using content
information, can reduce the number of distinct embeddings to be stored in
memory. This allows for a more lightweight model; correspondingly, model
complexity can be increased due to having fewer embeddings to store in memory.
We show the benefit of using shared content-based features ('semantic IDs') in
improving recommendation accuracy and diversity, while reducing model size, for
two music recommendation datasets, including an online A/B test on a music
streaming service.

Abstract: In contrast to single-user recommender systems, group recommender systems are
designed to generate and explain recommendations for groups. This
group-oriented setting introduces additional complexities, as several factors -
absent in individual contexts - must be addressed. These include understanding
group dynamics (e.g., social dependencies within the group), defining effective
decision-making processes, ensuring that recommendations are suitable for all
group members, and providing group-level explanations as well as explanations
for individual users. In this paper, we analyze in which way large language
models (LLMs) can support these aspects and help to increase the overall
decision support quality and applicability of group recommender systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推荐系统中，分类特征的获取成本高且困难，而现有的多任务框架在数据研究中的应用尚未充分开发。

Result: 研究表明，这种闭环方法在自动化特征发现中既实用又有效。

Conclusion: Agent0为推荐系统开发中最具挑战性的特征发现阶段提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and their associated agent-based frameworks have
significantly advanced automated information extraction, a critical component
of modern recommender systems. While these multitask frameworks are widely used
in code generation, their application in data-centric research is still largely
untapped. This paper presents Agent0, an LLM-driven, agent-based system
designed to automate information extraction and feature construction from raw,
unstructured text. Categorical features are crucial for large-scale recommender
systems but are often expensive to acquire. Agent0 coordinates a group of
interacting LLM agents to automatically identify the most valuable text aspects
for subsequent tasks (such as models or AutoML pipelines). Beyond its feature
engineering capabilities, Agent0 also offers an automated prompt-engineering
tuning method that utilizes dynamic feedback loops from an oracle. Our findings
demonstrate that this closed-loop methodology is both practical and effective
for automated feature discovery, which is recognized as one of the most
challenging phases in current recommender system development.

Result: 在多个数据集和模态上表现一致提升，包括电商文本描述和音乐音频表示。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了嵌入适应性和语义结构保持，提升了冷启动推荐性能。

Abstract: Many sequential recommender systems suffer from the cold start problem, where
items with few or no interactions cannot be effectively used by the model due
to the absence of a trained embedding. Content-based approaches, which leverage
item metadata, are commonly used in such scenarios. One possible way is to use
embeddings derived from content features such as textual descriptions as
initialization for the model embeddings. However, directly using frozen content
embeddings often results in suboptimal performance, as they may not fully adapt
to the recommendation task. On the other hand, fine-tuning these embeddings can
degrade performance for cold-start items, as item representations may drift far
from their original structure after training. We propose a novel approach to
address this limitation. Instead of entirely freezing the content embeddings or
fine-tuning them extensively, we introduce a small trainable delta to frozen
embeddings that enables the model to adapt item representations without letting
them go too far from their original semantic structure. This approach
demonstrates consistent improvements across multiple datasets and modalities,
including e-commerce datasets with textual descriptions and a music dataset
with audio-based representation.

Conclusion: 该框架扩展了可高效压缩的图信号类别，并展示了鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for discrete multiresolution analysis of graph
signals. The main analytical tool is the samplet transform, originally defined
in the Euclidean framework as a discrete wavelet-like construction, tailored to
the analysis of scattered data. The first contribution of this work is defining
samplets on graphs. To this end, we subdivide the graph into a fixed number of
patches, embed each patch into a Euclidean space, where we construct samplets,
and eventually pull the construction back to the graph. This ensures
orthogonality, locality, and the vanishing moments property with respect to
properly defined polynomial spaces on graphs. Compared to classical Haar
wavelets, this framework broadens the class of graph signals that can
efficiently be compressed and analyzed. Along this line, we provide a
definition of a class of signals that can be compressed using our construction.
We support our findings with different examples of signals defined on graphs
whose vertices lie on smooth manifolds. For efficient numerical implementation,
we combine heavy edge clustering, to partition the graph into meaningful
patches, with landmark \texttt{Isomap}, which provides low-dimensional
embeddings for each patch. Our results demonstrate the method's robustness,
scalability, and ability to yield sparse representations with controllable
approximation error, significantly outperforming traditional Haar wavelet
approaches in terms of compression efficiency and multiresolution fidelity.

Motivation: 探究零雷诺数条件下，游泳者是否会自然选择类似生物中常见的后向前波状划动（metachronal rhythm）作为最优游泳策略。

Method: 使用强化学习训练一个具有固定桨间距的游泳者模型，观察其在不同间距下学习的肢体协调模式。

Result: 紧密桨间距下，游泳者学习到类似生物的后向前波状划动；宽间距下则出现其他协调模式。最快速的划动模式取决于桨的数量，但最有效的模式始终是后向前波状划动。

Conclusion: 后向前波状划动在效率上具有普适优势，而速度最优模式则受桨数量影响。

Abstract: Metachronal paddling is a swimming strategy in which an organism oscillates
sets of adjacent limbs with a constant phase lag, propagating a metachronal
wave through its limbs and propelling it forward. This limb coordination
strategy is utilized by swimmers across a wide range of Reynolds numbers, which
suggests that this metachronal rhythm was selected for its optimality of
swimming performance. In this study, we apply reinforcement learning to a
swimmer at zero Reynolds number and investigate whether the learning algorithm
selects this metachronal rhythm, or if other coordination patterns emerge. We
design the swimmer agent with an elongated body and pairs of straight,
inflexible paddles placed along the body for various fixed paddle spacings.
Based on paddle spacing, the swimmer agent learns qualitatively different
coordination patterns. At tight spacings, a back-to-front metachronal wave-like
stroke emerges which resembles the commonly observed biological rhythm, but at
wide spacings, different limb coordinations are selected. Across all resulting
strokes, the fastest stroke is dependent on the number of paddles, however, the
most efficient stroke is a back-to-front wave-like stroke regardless of the
number of paddles.

Conclusion: 图拉普拉斯算子的特征值具有渐近统计效率，为相关领域提供了理论工具。

Abstract: Given i.i.d.\ samples $X_n =\{ x_1, \dots, x_n \}$ from a distribution
supported on a low dimensional manifold ${M}$ embedded in Eucliden space, we
consider the graph Laplacian operator $\Delta_n$ associated to an
$\varepsilon$-proximity graph over $X_n$ and study the asymptotic fluctuations
of its eigenvalues around their means. In particular, letting
$\hat{\lambda}_l^\varepsilon$ denote the $l$-th eigenvalue of $\Delta_n$, and
under suitable assumptions on the data generating model and on the rate of
decay of $\varepsilon$, we prove that $\sqrt{n } (\hat{\lambda}_{l}^\varepsilon
- \mathbb{E}[\hat{\lambda}_{l}^\varepsilon] )$ is asymptotically Gaussian with
a variance that we can explicitly characterize. A formal argument allows us to
interpret this asymptotic variance as the dissipation of a gradient flow of a
suitable energy with respect to the Fisher-Rao geometry. This geometric
interpretation allows us to give, in turn, a statistical interpretation of the
asymptotic variance in terms of a Cramer-Rao lower bound for the estimation of
the eigenvalues of certain weighted Laplace-Beltrami operator. The latter
interpretation suggests a form of asymptotic statistical efficiency for the
eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian. We also present CLTs for multiple
eigenvalues and through several numerical experiments explore the validity of
our results when some of the assumptions that we make in our theoretical
analysis are relaxed.

Result: PACC为倾向得分和工具变量等方法提供理论保障，并扩展至SCCS方法。

Conclusion: PACC框架为资源受限的因果发现提供了高效且理论可靠的新思路。

Abstract: The discovery of causal relationships is a foundational problem in artificial
intelligence, statistics, epidemiology, economics, and beyond. While elegant
theories exist for accurate causal discovery given infinite data, real-world
applications are inherently resource-constrained. Effective methods for
inferring causal relationships from observational data must perform well under
finite data and time constraints, where "performing well" implies achieving
high, though not perfect accuracy. In his seminal paper A Theory of the
Learnable, Valiant highlighted the importance of resource constraints in
supervised machine learning, introducing the concept of Probably Approximately
Correct (PAC) learning as an alternative to exact learning. Inspired by
Valiant's work, we propose the Probably Approximately Correct Causal (PACC)
Discovery framework, which extends PAC learning principles to the causal field.
This framework emphasizes both computational and sample efficiency for
established causal methods such as propensity score techniques and instrumental
variable approaches. Furthermore, we show that it can also provide theoretical
guarantees for other widely used methods, such as the Self-Controlled Case
Series (SCCS) method, which had previously lacked such guarantees.

models as its particular cases. The key task in this model is to recover the
groups of layers with unique subspace structures, since the case where all
layers of the network are embedded in the same subspace has been fairly well
studied. Until now, clustering of layers in such networks was based on the
layer-per-layer analysis, which required the multilayer network to be
sufficiently dense. Nevertheless, in this paper we succeeded in pooling
information in all layers together and providing a tensor-based methodology
that ensures perfect clustering for a much sparser network. Our theoretical
results, established under intuitive non-restrictive assumptions, assert that
the new technique achieves perfect clustering under sparsity conditions that,
up to logarithmic factors, coincide with the computational lower bound derived
for a much simpler model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏系统化的基准框架和深入分析，阻碍了新兴网络的探索和更鲁棒算法的开发。

Method: Virne框架提供可定制的网络场景模拟，支持30多种方法，并包括模块化实现。

Result: 通过广泛实验提供性能权衡的深入分析，为高效实现和未来研究方向提供指导。

Conclusion: Virne可作为推进NFV-RA方法和深度强化学习应用的全面基准。

Abstract: Resource allocation (RA) is critical to efficient service deployment in
Network Function Virtualization (NFV), a transformative networking paradigm.
Recently, deep Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based methods have been showing
promising potential to address this complexity. However, the lack of a
systematic benchmarking framework and thorough analysis hinders the exploration
of emerging networks and the development of more robust algorithms while
causing inconsistent evaluation. In this paper, we introduce Virne, a
comprehensive benchmarking framework for the NFV-RA problem, with a focus on
supporting deep RL-based methods. Virne provides customizable simulations for
diverse network scenarios, including cloud, edge, and 5G environments. It also
features a modular and extensible implementation pipeline that supports over 30
methods of various types, and includes practical evaluation perspectives beyond
effectiveness, such as scalability, generalization, and scalability.
Furthermore, we conduct in-depth analysis through extensive experiments to
provide valuable insights into performance trade-offs for efficient
implementation and offer actionable guidance for future research directions.
Overall, with its diverse simulations, rich implementations, and extensive
evaluation capabilities, Virne could serve as a comprehensive benchmark for
advancing NFV-RA methods and deep RL applications. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/GeminiLight/virne.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于LLM、TTS和ASR的全双工对话系统评测框架，填补了现有评测在用户打断场景的空白，并测试了三个开源系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评测缺乏针对全双工对话场景的指标，如用户打断时的模型表现。

Method: 利用LLM、TTS和ASR构建评测框架，评估系统在用户打断、延迟管理和鲁棒性方面的表现。

Result: 测试了三个开源系统（Moshi、Freeze-omni和VITA-1.5），结果显示它们在频繁打断和噪声条件下仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: 全双工对话系统仍需改进，特别是在用户打断和噪声环境下的表现。

Abstract: Full-duplex spoken dialogue systems (FDSDS) enable more natural human-machine
interactions by allowing real-time user interruptions and backchanneling,
compared to traditional SDS that rely on turn-taking. However, existing
benchmarks lack metrics for FD scenes, e.g., evaluating model performance
during user interruptions. In this paper, we present a comprehensive FD
benchmarking pipeline utilizing LLMs, TTS, and ASR to address this gap. It
assesses FDSDS's ability to handle user interruptions, manage delays, and
maintain robustness in challenging scenarios with diverse novel metrics. We
applied our benchmark to three open-source FDSDS (Moshi, Freeze-omni, and
VITA-1.5) using over 40 hours of generated speech, with 293 simulated
conversations and 1,200 interruptions. The results show that all models
continue to face challenges, such as failing to respond to user interruptions,
under frequent disruptions and noisy conditions. Demonstrations, data, and code
will be released.

*Simon Malan,Benjamin van Niekerk,Herman Kamper*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文研究了无标签语音分割为词类单元并聚类构建词典的问题，比较了自底向上和自顶向下两种方法，发现两者性能相当，但自底向上方法更快。聚类步骤是性能瓶颈，建议未来研究改进聚类技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自顶向下信息是否对语音分割改进必要，比较两种方法的效果和效率。

Method: 自底向上方法基于相邻自监督特征的差异预测边界并聚类；自顶向下方法（ES-KMeans）迭代更新边界。

Result: 两种方法在ZeroSpeech基准测试中性能相当，自底向上方法快五倍。聚类步骤是限制因素。

Conclusion: 自顶向下方法在某些情况下有益，但自底向上方法通常足够。未来应改进聚类技术和词类表示学习。

Abstract: We investigate the problem of segmenting unlabeled speech into word-like
units and clustering these to create a lexicon. Prior work can be categorized
into two frameworks. Bottom-up methods first determine boundaries and then
cluster the fixed segmented words into a lexicon. In contrast, top-down methods
incorporate information from the clustered words to inform boundary selection.
However, it is unclear whether top-down information is necessary to improve
segmentation. To explore this, we look at two similar approaches that differ in
whether top-down clustering informs boundary selection. Our simple bottom-up
strategy predicts word boundaries using the dissimilarity between adjacent
self-supervised features, then clusters the resulting segments to construct a
lexicon. Our top-down system is an updated version of the ES-KMeans dynamic
programming method that iteratively uses K-means to update its boundaries. On
the five-language ZeroSpeech benchmarks, both approaches achieve comparable
state-of-the-art results, with the bottom-up system being nearly five times
faster. Through detailed analyses, we show that the top-down influence of
ES-KMeans can be beneficial (depending on factors like the candidate
boundaries), but in many cases the simple bottom-up method performs just as
well. For both methods, we show that the clustering step is a limiting factor.
Therefore, we recommend that future work focus on improved clustering
techniques and learning more discriminative word-like representations. Project

TL;DR: 研究发现，对话语音中的感知人格因情境不同而显著变化，声学特征和非语言特征在预测人格特质上优于说话人嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨情境对感知人格的影响，弥补先前研究中将人格视为静态特质的不足。

Method: 分析参与者在两种工作情境（中性面试和压力客户互动）中的对话语音，提取声学和非语言特征。

Result: 感知人格在不同情境下差异显著；声学特征和非语言特征对人格预测更有效；压力情境更能预测神经质。

Conclusion: 情境对感知人格有显著影响，声学和非语言特征是预测人格的有效指标。

Abstract: Prior research indicates that users prefer assistive technologies whose
personalities align with their own. This has sparked interest in automatic
personality perception (APP), which aims to predict an individual's perceived
personality traits. Previous studies in APP have treated personalities as
static traits, independent of context. However, perceived personalities can
vary by context and situation as shown in psychological research. In this
study, we investigate the relationship between conversational speech and
perceived personality for participants engaged in two work situations (a
neutral interview and a stressful client interaction). Our key findings are: 1)
perceived personalities differ significantly across interactions, 2) loudness,
sound level, and spectral flux features are indicative of perceived
extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness in neutral
interactions, while neuroticism correlates with these features in stressful
contexts, 3) handcrafted acoustic features and non-verbal features outperform
speaker embeddings in inference of perceived personality, and 4) stressful
interactions are more predictive of neuroticism, aligning with existing
psychological research.

TL;DR: PurpCode是一种后训练方法，用于训练安全的代码推理模型，生成安全代码并防御恶意网络活动。通过规则学习和强化学习两阶段训练，结合内部红队测试数据，开发了PurpCode-32B模型，在网络安全和模型实用性上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码生成模型在网络安全方面存在不足，容易生成不安全代码或助长恶意活动。PurpCode旨在填补这一空白，提供一种训练安全代码推理模型的方法。

Method: PurpCode采用两阶段训练：规则学习（明确教授网络安全规则）和强化学习（通过多目标奖励机制优化安全性和实用性）。利用内部红队测试生成全面网络安全数据。

Result: 开发的PurpCode-32B模型在网络安全方面表现最优，同时减少了模型的过度拒绝率，并保持了代码生成和安全知识的实用性。

Conclusion: PurpCode为训练安全代码推理模型提供了有效方法，显著提升了模型在网络安全和实用性上的表现。

Abstract: We introduce PurpCode, the first post-training recipe for training safe code
reasoning models towards generating secure code and defending against malicious
cyberactivities. PurpCode trains a reasoning model in two stages: (i) Rule
Learning, which explicitly teaches the model to reference cybersafety rules to
generate vulnerability-free code and to avoid facilitating malicious
cyberactivities; and (ii) Reinforcement Learning, which optimizes model safety
and preserves model utility through diverse, multi-objective reward mechanisms.
To empower the training pipelines with comprehensive cybersafety data, we
conduct internal red-teaming to synthesize comprehensive and high-coverage
prompts based on real-world tasks for inducing unsafe cyberactivities in the
model. Based on PurpCode, we develop a reasoning-based coding model, namely
PurpCode-32B, which demonstrates state-of-the-art cybersafety, outperforming
various frontier models. Meanwhile, our alignment method decreases the model
overrefusal rates in both general and cybersafety-specific scenarios, while
preserving model utility in both code generation and common security knowledge.

TL;DR: PrompTrend系统通过多维评分收集在线社区中的LLM漏洞数据，发现心理攻击效果优于技术攻击，且平台动态影响攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态基准测试无法捕捉在线社区实验中的LLM漏洞，需动态监测。

Method: PrompTrend系统收集漏洞数据并多维评分，分析198个漏洞和9个商业模型。

Result: 心理攻击效果显著，平台动态影响攻击效果，78%分类准确率。

Conclusion: LLM安全需综合社会技术监测，心理攻击是主要威胁。

Abstract: Static benchmarks fail to capture LLM vulnerabilities emerging through
community experimentation in online forums. We present PrompTrend, a system
that collects vulnerability data across platforms and evaluates them using
multidimensional scoring, with an architecture designed for scalable
monitoring. Cross-sectional analysis of 198 vulnerabilities collected from
online communities over a five-month period (January-May 2025) and tested on
nine commercial models reveals that advanced capabilities correlate with
increased vulnerability in some architectures, psychological attacks
significantly outperform technical exploits, and platform dynamics shape attack
effectiveness with measurable model-specific patterns. The PrompTrend
Vulnerability Assessment Framework achieves 78% classification accuracy while
revealing limited cross-model transferability, demonstrating that effective LLM
security requires comprehensive socio-technical monitoring beyond traditional
periodic assessment. Our findings challenge the assumption that capability
advancement improves security and establish community-driven psychological
manipulation as the dominant threat vector for current language models.

TL;DR: 论文提出CIRCLE基准测试，评估LLMs集成代码解释器时的系统级网络安全风险，发现商业模型存在显著漏洞，尤其是间接提示削弱防御。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs集成代码解释器，系统级网络安全威胁成为新问题，需要系统性评估。

Method: 提出CIRCLE基准测试，包含1,260个针对CPU、内存和磁盘资源耗尽的提示，自动评估LLMs的拒绝率、代码生成及执行行为。

Result: 评估7个商业模型发现显著漏洞，如OpenAI的o4-mini拒绝率为7.1%，而GPT-4.1仅0.5%，间接提示尤其削弱防御。

Conclusion: 需开发专用网络安全基准、缓解工具和行业标准，以确保LLM解释器集成的安全部署。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly integrate native code
interpreters, they enable powerful real-time execution capabilities,
substantially expanding their utility. However, such integrations introduce
potential system-level cybersecurity threats, fundamentally different from
prompt-based vulnerabilities. To systematically evaluate these
interpreter-specific risks, we propose CIRCLE (Code-Interpreter Resilience
Check for LLM Exploits), a simple benchmark comprising 1,260 prompts targeting
CPU, memory, and disk resource exhaustion. Each risk category includes
explicitly malicious ("direct") and plausibly benign ("indirect") prompt
variants. Our automated evaluation framework assesses not only whether LLMs
refuse or generates risky code, but also executes the generated code within the
interpreter environment to evaluate code correctness, simplifications made by
the LLM to make the code safe, or execution timeouts. Evaluating 7 commercially
available models from OpenAI and Google, we uncover significant and
inconsistent vulnerabilities. For instance, evaluations show substantial
disparities even within providers - OpenAI's o4-mini correctly refuses risky
requests at 7.1%, notably higher rates compared to GPT-4.1 at 0.5%. Results
particularly underscore that indirect, socially-engineered prompts
substantially weaken model defenses. This highlights an urgent need for
interpreter-specific cybersecurity benchmarks, dedicated mitigation tools
(e.g., guardrails), and clear industry standards to guide safe and responsible
deployment of LLM interpreter integrations. The benchmark dataset and
evaluation code are publicly released to foster further research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图神经网络（GNN）的预测器，用于自动化选择最适合执行特定量子电路的量子硬件，避免了传统暴力方法的计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子硬件技术的多样性导致选择最佳执行平台变得复杂且计算成本高昂，需要一种更高效的自动化方法。

Method: 使用GNN分析量子电路的有向无环图（DAG）表示，预测最佳硬件选择，并在MQT Bench数据集上评估了498个量子电路。

Result: 实验结果显示预测准确率为94.4%，F1分数为85.5%，显著提升了硬件选择的效率和准确性。

Conclusion: 基于图机器学习的自动化硬件选择方法高效且准确，为量子计算资源优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: The growing variety of quantum hardware technologies, each with unique
peculiarities such as connectivity and native gate sets, creates challenges
when selecting the best platform for executing a specific quantum circuit. This
selection process usually involves a brute-force approach: compiling the
circuit on various devices and evaluating performance based on factors such as
circuit depth and gate fidelity. However, this method is computationally
expensive and does not scale well as the number of available quantum processors
increases. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based
predictor that automates hardware selection by analyzing the Directed Acyclic
Graph (DAG) representation of a quantum circuit. Our study evaluates 498
quantum circuits (up to 27 qubits) from the MQT Bench dataset, compiled using
Qiskit on four devices: three superconducting quantum processors (IBM-Kyiv,
IBM-Brisbane, IBM-Sherbrooke) and one trapped-ion processor (IONQ-Forte).
Performance is estimated using a metric that integrates circuit depth and gate
fidelity, resulting in a dataset where 93 circuits are optimally compiled on
the trapped-ion device, while the remaining circuits prefer superconducting
platforms. By exploiting graph-based machine learning, our approach avoids
extracting the circuit features for the model evaluation but directly embeds it
as a graph, significantly accelerating the optimal target decision-making
process and maintaining all the information. Experimental results prove 94.4%
accuracy and an 85.5% F1 score for the minority class, effectively predicting
the best compilation target. The developed code is publicly available on GitHub
(https://github.com/antotu/GNN-Model-Quantum-Predictor).

Motivation: 传统自注意力机制在处理长序列时效率低下，需要更高效的解决方案。

Result: PGKET在MedMNIST v2和CIFAR-10多分类任务中优于现有Transformer模型。

Conclusion: PGKET有望提升复杂任务性能并加速光子计算与机器学习的融合。

Abstract: Self-Attention Mechanisms (SAMs) enhance model performance by extracting key
information but are inefficient when dealing with long sequences. To this end,
a photonic Gaussian Kernel Enhanced Transformer (PGKET) is proposed, based on
the Photonic Gaussian Kernel Self-Attention Mechanism (PGKSAM). The PGKSAM
calculates the Photonic Gaussian Kernel Self-Attention Score (PGKSAS) using
photon interferometry and superposition to process multiple inputs in parallel.
Experimental results show that PGKET outperforms some state-of-the-art
transformers in multi-classification tasks on MedMNIST v2 and CIFAR-10, and is
expected to improve performance in complex tasks and accelerate the convergence
of Photonic Computing (PC) and machine learning.

Exchange. Later, the linear model has been compared with random forest based on
different metrics showing better results for random forest model. However, the
amount of individual significance of different factors on the variability of

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于LLM的工程代理，用于大规模修复代码中的测试失败问题，结合ReAct框架和静态分析工具，取得了42.3%的解决率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM的发展，大规模代码修复成为可能，目标是开发一个能够高效修复测试失败的工程代理。

Method: 以Llama为基础，结合ReAct框架，代理通过15个动作（从读取文件到生成补丁）进行推理，并利用静态分析和测试失败反馈优化解决方案。

Result: 离线评估中，70B模型表现优于405B模型，解决率为42.3%。生产中，31.5%的修复被采纳。

Conclusion: 工程代理在代码修复中表现出色，但仍有改进空间，工程师反馈总体积极。

Abstract: Aim: With the advent of LLMs, sophisticated agentic program repair has become
viable at large organizations with large codebases. In this work, we develop an
Engineering Agent that fixes the source code based on test failures at scale
across diverse software offerings internally.
  Method: Using Llama as the base, we employ the ReAct harness to develop an
agent. We start with a test failure that was triaged by a rule-based test
failure bot. We then set up an agentic harness and allow the agent to reason
and run a set of 15 actions from reading a file to generating a patch. We
provide feedback to the agent through static analysis and test failures so it
can refine its solution. We leverage an LLM-as-a-Judge to ensure that the patch
conforms to the standards followed by a human review to land fixes.
  Benchmark Findings: We curated offline benchmarks for our patch generator,
the Engineering Agent loop, and the LLM-as-a-Judge. In offline evaluations we
found that a specialized 70B model is highly competitive with the much larger
but vanilla Llama-405B. In an ablation study, we found that the ReAct harness
(neural model) benefited from the symbolic information from static analysis
tools and test execution traces. A model that strikes a balance between the
solve rate and error rate vs the cost and latency has a benchmark solve rate of
42.3% using an average 11.8 feedback iterations.
  Production Findings: In a three month period, 80% of the generated fixes were
reviewed, of which 31.5% were landed (25.5% of the total number of generated
fixes).
  Feedback from Engineers: We used open coding to extract qualitative themes
from engineers' feedback. We saw positive feedback in the form of quick
approvals, gratitude, and surprise. We also found mixed feedback when the
Engineering Agent's solution was partially correct and it served as a good
starting point.

Motivation: 现有方法如微调或自我修复策略成本高或缺乏知识积累机制，MemoCoder旨在解决这些问题。

Method: MemoCoder使用修复知识集存储成功修复，并通过导师代理监督修复过程。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MemoCoder表现优于零样本提示和自我修复策略，提升显著。

Conclusion: MemoCoder在迭代优化和知识引导的代码生成中表现优异。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GitHub
Copilot and ChatGPT, developers increasingly rely on AI-assisted tools to
support code generation. While LLMs can generate syntactically correct
solutions for well-structured programming tasks, they often struggle with
challenges that require iterative debugging, error handling, or adaptation to
diverse problem structures. Existing approaches such as fine-tuning or
self-repair strategies either require costly retraining or lack mechanisms to
accumulate and reuse knowledge from previous attempts.
  To address these limitations, we propose MemoCoder, a multi-agent framework
that enables collaborative problem solving and persistent learning from past
fixes. At the core of MemoCoder is a Fixing Knowledge Set, which stores
successful repairs and supports retrieval for future tasks. A central Mentor
Agent supervises the repair process by identifying recurring error patterns and
refining high-level fixing strategies, providing a novel supervisory role that
guides the self-repair loop. We evaluate MemoCoder across three public
benchmarks -- MBPP, HumanEval, and LiveCodeBench -- spanning a range of problem
complexities. Experimental results show that MemoCoder consistently outperforms
both zero-shot prompting and a Self-Repair strategy, with improvements ranging
from 3.1% to 12.1% in Pass@10 and from 1.4% to 14.5% in Pass@50, demonstrating
its effectiveness in iterative refinement and knowledge-guided code generation.

Abstract: Code review is one of the primary means of assuring the quality of released
software along with testing and static analysis. However, code review requires
experienced developers who may not always have the time to perform an in-depth

burden on experienced software developers allowing them to focus on their
primary activities of writing code to add new features and fix bugs. In this
paper, we describe our experience in using Large Language Models towards
automating the code review process in Ericsson. We describe the development of
a lightweight tool using LLMs and static program analysis. We then describe our
preliminary experiments with experienced developers in evaluating our code
review tool and the encouraging results.

Conclusion: 语言对齐和任务特定适配对优化语言模型在代码审查中的表现至关重要。

Abstract: Code review is essential for maintaining software quality but often
time-consuming and cognitively demanding, especially in industrial
environments. Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have opened new
avenues for automating core review tasks. This study presents the empirical
evaluation of monolingual fine-tuning on the performance of open-source LMs
across three key automated code review tasks: Code Change Quality Estimation,
Review Comment Generation, and Code Refinement. We fine-tuned three distinct
models, CodeReviewer, CodeLlama-7B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill, on a C\# specific
dataset combining public benchmarks with industrial repositories. Our study
investigates how different configurations of programming languages and natural
languages in the training data affect LM performance, particularly in comment
generation. Additionally, we benchmark the fine-tuned models against an
automated software analysis tool (ASAT) and human reviewers to evaluate their
practical utility in real-world settings. Our results show that monolingual
fine-tuning improves model accuracy and relevance compared to multilingual
baselines. While LMs can effectively support code review workflows, especially
for routine or repetitive tasks, human reviewers remain superior in handling
semantically complex or context-sensitive changes. Our findings highlight the
importance of language alignment and task-specific adaptation in optimizing LMs
for automated code review.

Motivation: 随着LLM的快速更新（如微调、合并或新模型发布），可能引入回归问题，影响代码的正确性、质量和性能。

Method: ReCatcher系统比较两个LLM（通常是当前模型和候选更新）在逻辑正确性、静态代码质量和执行性能三个维度上的表现。

Result: 评估显示，微调可能导致语法错误增加12%，合并可能导致正确性下降18%，GPT-4o在缺失导入处理上比GPT-3.5-turbo差50%。

Conclusion: ReCatcher在逻辑和性能方面优于基线方法，强调了系统回归评估的重要性，帮助研究者和从业者做出更明智的更新决策。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation evolve rapidly through
fine-tuning, merging, or new model releases. However, such updates can
introduce regressions, not only in correctness but also in code quality and
performance. To address this, we present ReCatcher, a regression testing
framework for Python code generation. ReCatcher systematically compares two
LLMs, typically a current model and a candidate update, across three
dimensions: logical correctness, static code quality, and execution
performance. We apply ReCatcher to assess regressions across three update
scenarios, fine-tuning, merging, and model release, using CodeLlama,
DeepSeek-Coder, and GPT-4o. Our evaluation shows that fine-tuning with
cross-language datasets increases syntax errors by up to 12%. Merging with
general-purpose models like Llama2 leads to regressions in correctness by up to
18%. GPT-4o introduces regressions of up to 50% in handling missing imports
compared to GPT-3.5-turbo, while GPT-4o-mini suffers up to 80% performance
degradation in execution time versus GPT-4o. Overall, logical correctness,
performance, and error handling (e.g., syntax errors and missing imports) are
the most regression-prone areas. Comparing ReCatcher with baseline solutions,
it presents better and consistent accuracy across logical and performance
aspects. ReCatcher highlights the importance of systematic regression
evaluation before adopting new models, while assisting researchers and
practitioners in making more informed update decisions.

TL;DR: SDVDiag是一个用于自动诊断联网车辆功能的可扩展平台，通过动态依赖图和异常监测快速定位故障根源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联网车辆的高可靠性和可用性要求需要快速解决故障，但复杂的云/边缘架构依赖关系使手动分析不可行。

Method: SDVDiag平台构建动态依赖图，监测系统指标异常，并通过图遍历生成最可能故障原因的排名。

Result: 在5G测试环境中，SDVDiag能可靠检测注入的故障，减少停机时间。

Conclusion: SDVDiag为联网车辆故障诊断提供了高效自动化解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Connected and software-defined vehicles promise to offer a broad range of
services and advanced functions to customers, aiming to increase passenger
comfort and support autonomous driving capabilities. Due to the high
reliability and availability requirements of connected vehicles, it is crucial
to resolve any occurring failures quickly. To achieve this however, a complex
cloud/edge architecture with a mesh of dependencies must be navigated to
diagnose the responsible root cause. As such, manual analyses become unfeasible
since they would significantly delay the troubleshooting.
  To address this challenge, this paper presents SDVDiag, an extensible
platform for the automated diagnosis of connected vehicle functions. The
platform enables the creation of pipelines that cover all steps from initial
data collection to the tracing of potential root causes. In addition, SDVDiag
supports self-adaptive behavior by the ability to exchange modules at runtime.
Dependencies between functions are detected and continuously updated, resulting
in a dynamic graph view of the system. In addition, vital system metrics are
monitored for anomalies. Whenever an incident is investigated, a snapshot of
the graph is taken and augmented by relevant anomalies. Finally, the analysis
is performed by traversing the graph and creating a ranking of the most likely
causes.
  To evaluate the platform, it is deployed inside an 5G test fleet environment
for connected vehicle functions. The results show that injected faults can be
detected reliably. As such, the platform offers the potential to gain new
insights and reduce downtime by identifying problems and their causes at an
early stage.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种人机协同的主动学习框架，优化锂碳酸盐的连续结晶过程，显著提高了对高杂质含量的耐受性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着电动车行业对高纯度锂的需求增长，从低品位资源（如Smackover Formation）中经济高效地提取锂成为关键。

Method: 采用人机协同（HITL）的主动学习框架，结合人类专业知识和数据驱动优化连续结晶过程。

Result: 框架显著提高了对镁等关键杂质的耐受性（从几百ppm提升至6000ppm），使低品位锂资源的利用成为可能。

Conclusion: 该技术为北美锂资源的开发提供了经济可行的解决方案，推动了全球锂供应链的可持续发展。

Abstract: As demand for high-purity lithium surges with the growth of the electric
vehicle (EV) industry, cost-effective extraction from lower-grade North
American sources like the Smackover Formation is critical. These resources,
unlike high-purity South American brines, require innovative purification
techniques to be economically viable. Continuous crystallization is a promising
method for producing battery-grade lithium carbonate, but its optimization is
challenged by a complex parameter space and limited data. This study introduces
a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) assisted active learning framework to optimize the
continuous crystallization of lithium carbonate. By integrating human expertise
with data-driven insights, our approach accelerates the optimization of lithium
extraction from challenging sources. Our results demonstrate the framework's
ability to rapidly adapt to new data, significantly improving the process's
tolerance to critical impurities like magnesium from the industry standard of a
few hundred ppm to as high as 6000 ppm. This breakthrough makes the
exploitation of low-grade, impurity-rich lithium resources feasible,
potentially reducing the need for extensive pre-refinement processes. By
leveraging artificial intelligence, we have refined operational parameters and
demonstrated that lower-grade materials can be used without sacrificing product
quality. This advancement is a significant step towards economically harnessing
North America's vast lithium reserves, such as those in the Smackover
Formation, and enhancing the sustainability of the global lithium supply chain.

Conclusion: 研究为视觉任务中的专业知识获取提供了见解，并有助于设计AI辅助学习干预措施。

Abstract: Understanding how novices acquire and hone visual search skills is crucial
for developing and optimizing training methods across domains. Network analysis
methods can be used to analyze graph representations of visual expertise. This
study investigates the relationship between eye-gaze movements and learning
outcomes among undergraduate dentistry students who were diagnosing dental
radiographs over multiple semesters. We use network analysis techniques to
model eye-gaze scanpaths as directed graphs and examine changes in network
metrics over time. Using time series clustering on each metric, we identify
distinct patterns of visual search strategies and explore their association
with students' diagnostic performance. Our findings suggest that the network
metric of transition entropy is negatively correlated with performance scores,
while the number of nodes and edges as well as average PageRank are positively
correlated with performance scores. Changes in network metrics for individual
students over time suggest a developmental shift from intermediate to
expert-level processing. These insights contribute to understanding expertise
acquisition in visual tasks and can inform the design of AI-assisted learning
interventions.

Method: 通过在线游戏收集数据，参与者随机查看真实和AI生成图像并判断其真实性。

Result: 整体准确率为62%，人类肖像识别最准，自然和城市景观识别较差。

Conclusion: 人类难以区分AI生成图像，需开发透明工具（如水印和检测工具）以减少误导风险。

Abstract: As AI-powered image generation improves, a key question is how well human
beings can differentiate between "real" and AI-generated or modified images.
Using data collected from the online game "Real or Not Quiz.", this study
investigates how effectively people can distinguish AI-generated images from
real ones. Participants viewed a randomized set of real and AI-generated
images, aiming to identify their authenticity. Analysis of approximately
287,000 image evaluations by over 12,500 global participants revealed an
overall success rate of only 62\%, indicating a modest ability, slightly above
chance. Participants were most accurate with human portraits but struggled
significantly with natural and urban landscapes. These results highlight the
inherent challenge humans face in distinguishing AI-generated visual content,
particularly images without obvious artifacts or stylistic cues. This study
stresses the need for transparency tools, such as watermarks and robust AI
detection tools to mitigate the risks of misinformation arising from
AI-generated content

<details>

Motivation: 当前人类反馈方法在比较长文本时存在认知挑战，需要更高效的方法来改进LLM对齐。

Method: 提出分解原则，开发DxHF界面，通过分解主张、视觉编码和链接相似主张来优化比较过程。

Result: DxHF平均提高反馈准确性5%，但增加18秒反馈时间；不确定性用户准确性显著提升。

Conclusion: 分解原则和DxHF界面展示了HCI在改进人机对齐中的潜力。

Abstract: Human preferences are widely used to align large language models (LLMs)
through methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).
However, the current user interfaces require annotators to compare text
paragraphs, which is cognitively challenging when the texts are long or
unfamiliar. This paper contributes by studying the decomposition principle as
an approach to improving the quality of human feedback for LLM alignment. This
approach breaks down the text into individual claims instead of directly
comparing two long-form text responses. Based on the principle, we build a
novel user interface DxHF. It enhances the comparison process by showing
decomposed claims, visually encoding the relevance of claims to the
conversation and linking similar claims. This allows users to skim through key
information and identify differences for better and quicker judgment. Our
technical evaluation shows evidence that decomposition generally improves
feedback accuracy regarding the ground truth, particularly for users with
uncertainty. A crowdsourcing study with 160 participants indicates that using
DxHF improves feedback accuracy by an average of 5%, although it increases the
average feedback time by 18 seconds. Notably, accuracy is significantly higher
in situations where users have less certainty. The finding of the study
highlights the potential of HCI as an effective method for improving human-AI
alignment.

Motivation: 探讨LLM在商业合作场景中如何影响人类行为，验证其潜在应用价值。

Method: 通过囚徒困境实验（重复和单次游戏），比较人类与LLM、经典机器人的合作行为差异。

Result: LLM的合作率低于人类但较高；沟通提升合作率（+88%），且人类互动后对LLM的合作行为有溢出效应。

Conclusion: LLM在合作场景中可谨慎使用，其行为与人类接近，沟通能显著提升合作。

Abstract: Machines driven by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to augment
humans across various tasks, a development with profound implications for
business settings where effective communication, collaboration, and stakeholder
trust are paramount. To explore how interacting with an LLM instead of a human
might shift cooperative behavior in such settings, we used the Prisoner's
Dilemma game -- a surrogate of several real-world managerial and economic
scenarios. In Experiment 1 (N=100), participants engaged in a thirty-round
repeated game against a human, a classic bot, and an LLM (GPT, in real-time).
In Experiment 2 (N=192), participants played a one-shot game against a human or
an LLM, with half of them allowed to communicate with their opponent, enabling
LLMs to leverage a key advantage over older-generation machines. Cooperation
rates with LLMs -- while lower by approximately 10-15 percentage points
compared to interactions with human opponents -- were nonetheless high. This
finding was particularly notable in Experiment 2, where the psychological cost
of selfish behavior was reduced. Although allowing communication about
cooperation did not close the human-machine behavioral gap, it increased the
likelihood of cooperation with both humans and LLMs equally (by 88%), which is
particularly surprising for LLMs given their non-human nature and the
assumption that people might be less receptive to cooperating with machines
compared to human counterparts. Additionally, cooperation with LLMs was higher
following prior interaction with humans, suggesting a spillover effect in
cooperative behavior. Our findings validate the (careful) use of LLMs by
businesses in settings that have a cooperative component.

Result: 用户研究表明，TreeReader提高了阅读效率和理解能力。

Conclusion: TreeReader通过结合层次化摘要和交互式探索，提供了一种更高效、更聚焦的学术文献阅读方式。

Abstract: Efficiently navigating and understanding academic papers is crucial for
scientific progress. Traditional linear formats like PDF and HTML can cause
cognitive overload and obscure a paper's hierarchical structure, making it
difficult to locate key information. While LLM-based chatbots offer
summarization, they often lack nuanced understanding of specific sections, may
produce unreliable information, and typically discard the document's
navigational structure. Drawing insights from a formative study on academic
reading practices, we introduce TreeReader, a novel language model-augmented
paper reader. TreeReader decomposes papers into an interactive tree structure
where each section is initially represented by an LLM-generated concise
summary, with underlying details accessible on demand. This design allows users
to quickly grasp core ideas, selectively explore sections of interest, and
verify summaries against the source text. A user study was conducted to
evaluate TreeReader's impact on reading efficiency and comprehension.
TreeReader provides a more focused and efficient way to navigate and understand
complex academic literature by bridging hierarchical summarization with
interactive exploration.

Abstract: Pneumonia remains one of the leading causes of death among children
worldwide, underscoring a critical need for fast and accurate diagnostic tools.
In this paper, we propose an interpretable deep learning model on Residual

Activation Mapping (BayesGrad-CAM), which quantifies uncertainty in visual
explanations, and which offers spatial locations accountable for the
decision-making process of the model. Our ResNet-50 model, trained on a large
paediatric chest X-rays dataset, achieves high classification accuracy
(95.94%), AUC-ROC (98.91%), and Cohen's Kappa (0.913), accompanied by
clinically meaningful visual explanations. Our findings demonstrate that high
performance and interpretability are not only achievable but critical for

Result: 方法将重建时间缩短两个数量级，提升图像质量，并实现多光谱重建。

Conclusion: 学习型单像素荧光显微成像有望推动诊断和生物研究，以低成本实现多光谱成像。

Abstract: Single-pixel imaging has emerged as a key technique in fluorescence
microscopy, where fast acquisition and reconstruction are crucial. In this
context, images are reconstructed from linearly compressed measurements. In
practice, total variation minimisation is still used to reconstruct the image
from noisy measurements of the inner product between orthogonal sampling
pattern vectors and the original image data. However, data can be leveraged to
learn the measurement vectors and the reconstruction process, thereby enhancing
compression, reconstruction quality, and speed. We train an autoencoder through
self-supervision to learn an encoder (or measurement matrix) and a decoder. We
then test it on physically acquired multispectral and intensity data. During
acquisition, the learned encoder becomes part of the physical device. Our
approach can enhance single-pixel imaging in fluorescence microscopy by
reducing reconstruction time by two orders of magnitude, achieving superior
image quality, and enabling multispectral reconstructions. Ultimately, learned
single-pixel fluorescence microscopy could advance diagnosis and biological
research, providing multispectral imaging at a fraction of the cost.

Result: 使用FID和LPIPS等指标评估图像真实性，并引入新指标验证生成图像在噪声分布、锐度和纹理方面的真实性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了生成脑部图像的细节和真实性。

Abstract: We propose image-to-image diffusion models that are designed to enhance the
realism and details of generated brain images by introducing sharp edges, fine
textures, subtle anatomical features, and imaging noise. Generative models have
been widely adopted in the biomedical domain, especially in image generation
applications. Latent diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art results in
generating brain MRIs. However, due to latent compression, generated images
from these models are overly smooth, lacking fine anatomical structures and
scan acquisition noise that are typically seen in real images. This work
formulates the realism enhancing and detail adding process as image-to-image
diffusion models, which refines the quality of LDM-generated images. We employ
commonly used metrics like FID and LPIPS for image realism assessment.
Furthermore, we introduce new metrics to demonstrate the realism of images
generated by RealDeal in terms of image noise distribution, sharpness, and
texture.

Conclusion: 改进的后处理技术能有效管理分割错误，提高针重建精度。

Abstract: Brachytherapy involves bringing a radioactive source near tumor tissue using
implanted needles. Image-guided brachytherapy planning requires amongst others,
the reconstruction of the needles. Manually annotating these needles on patient
images can be a challenging and time-consuming task for medical professionals.
For automatic needle reconstruction, a two-stage pipeline is commonly adopted,
comprising a segmentation stage followed by a post-processing stage. While deep
learning models are effective for segmentation, their results often contain
errors. No currently existing post-processing technique is robust to all
possible segmentation errors. We therefore propose adaptations to existing
post-processing techniques mainly aimed at dealing with segmentation errors and
thereby improving the reconstruction accuracy. Experiments on a prostate cancer
dataset, based on MRI scans annotated by medical professionals, demonstrate
that our proposed adaptations can help to effectively manage segmentation
errors, with the best adapted post-processing technique achieving median
needle-tip and needle-bottom point localization errors of $1.07$ (IQR $\pm
1.04$) mm and $0.43$ (IQR $\pm 0.46$) mm, respectively, and median shaft error
of $0.75$ (IQR $\pm 0.69$) mm with 0 false positive and 0 false negative
needles on a test set of 261 needles.

Motivation: 医学图像中的噪声会影响诊断和治疗效果，现有方法通常仅针对单一模态或噪声类型，缺乏通用性。

Method: 采用双路径学习（DPL）模型，同时利用噪声特征和图像上下文信息进行去噪。

Result: DPL在多种模态和噪声类型中表现优异，PSNR比基线UNet提高了3.35%。

Conclusion: DPL是一种通用且高效的医学图像去噪方法，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a critical role in modern healthcare, enabling
clinicians to accurately diagnose diseases and develop effective treatment
plans. However, noise, often introduced by imaging devices, can degrade image
quality, leading to misinterpretation and compromised clinical outcomes.
Existing denoising approaches typically rely either on noise characteristics or
on contextual information from the image. Moreover, they are commonly developed
and evaluated for a single imaging modality and noise type. Motivated by Geng
et.al CNCL, which integrates both noise and context, this study introduces a
Dual-Pathway Learning (DPL) model architecture that effectively denoises
medical images by leveraging both sources of information and fusing them to
generate the final output. DPL is evaluated across multiple imaging modalities
and various types of noise, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.
DPL improves PSNR by 3.35% compared to the baseline UNet when evaluated on
Gaussian noise and trained across all modalities. The code is available at

Motivation: 准确分割和量化COPD患者的肺血管（尤其是小血管）对疾病分析至关重要，但传统方法依赖大量标注数据。

Method: 采用教师-学生模型的自训练框架，先通过交互方式获取高质量标注数据训练教师模型，再生成伪标签训练学生模型，迭代优化性能。

Result: 在125名COPD患者的非增强CT扫描上测试，Semi2方法将血管分割精度提高了2.3%，达到90.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了肺血管分割性能，还可用于COPD分析，代码已开源。

Abstract: Background: It is fundamental for accurate segmentation and quantification of
the pulmonary vessel, particularly smaller vessels, from computed tomography
(CT) images in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients.
Objective: The aim of this study was to segment the pulmonary vasculature using
a semi-supervised method. Methods: In this study, a self-training framework is
proposed by leveraging a teacher-student model for the segmentation of
pulmonary vessels. First, the high-quality annotations are acquired in the
in-house data by an interactive way. Then, the model is trained in the
semi-supervised way. A fully supervised model is trained on a small set of
labeled CT images, yielding the teacher model. Following this, the teacher
model is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled CT images, from which
reliable ones are selected based on a certain strategy. The training of the
student model involves these reliable pseudo-labels. This training process is
iteratively repeated until an optimal performance is achieved. Results:
Extensive experiments are performed on non-enhanced CT scans of 125 COPD
patients. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that the proposed
method, Semi2, significantly improves the precision of vessel segmentation by
2.3%, achieving a precision of 90.3%. Further, quantitative analysis is
conducted in the pulmonary vessel of COPD, providing insights into the
differences in the pulmonary vessel across different severity of the disease.
Conclusion: The proposed method can not only improve the performance of
pulmonary vascular segmentation, but can also be applied in COPD analysis. The
code will be made available at

Conclusion: HPCM通过高效上下文建模，显著提升了图像压缩性能。

Abstract: Context modeling is essential in learned image compression for accurately
estimating the distribution of latents. While recent advanced methods have
expanded context modeling capacity, they still struggle to efficiently exploit
long-range dependency and diverse context information across different coding
steps. In this paper, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Progressive Context
Model (HPCM) for more efficient context information acquisition. Specifically,
HPCM employs a hierarchical coding schedule to sequentially model the
contextual dependencies among latents at multiple scales, which enables more
efficient long-range context modeling. Furthermore, we propose a progressive
context fusion mechanism that incorporates contextual information from previous
coding steps into the current step, effectively exploiting diverse contextual
information. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance and strikes a better balance
between compression performance and computational complexity. The code is

Motivation: 研究生成模型在医学影像中重建和生成任务的不同需求，探索如何平衡感知质量和数据保真度。

Method: 引入“生成模型动物园”，系统分析潜在扩散模型和自回归模型在重建与生成任务中的表现，并在心脏医学影像任务中进行基准测试。

Result: 扩散模型在无条件生成中表现更优，但随着掩蔽比例增加易产生幻觉；自回归模型在掩蔽比例变化时表现稳定，但保真度较低。

Conclusion: 不同生成模型在医学影像任务中各有优劣，需根据具体任务需求选择合适的模型。

Abstract: In medical imaging, generative models are increasingly relied upon for two
distinct but equally critical tasks: reconstruction, where the goal is to
restore medical imaging (usually inverse problems like inpainting or
superresolution), and generation, where synthetic data is created to augment
datasets or carry out counterfactual analysis. Despite shared architecture and
learning frameworks, they prioritize different goals: generation seeks high
perceptual quality and diversity, while reconstruction focuses on data fidelity
and faithfulness. In this work, we introduce a "generative model zoo" and
systematically analyze how modern latent diffusion models and autoregressive
models navigate the reconstruction-generation spectrum. We benchmark a suite of
generative models across representative cardiac medical imaging tasks, focusing
on image inpainting with varying masking ratios and sampling strategies, as
well as unconditional image generation. Our findings show that diffusion models
offer superior perceptual quality for unconditional generation but tend to
hallucinate as masking ratios increase, whereas autoregressive models maintain
stable perceptual performance across masking levels, albeit with generally
lower fidelity.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合全局注意力块（GAB）和类别注意力块（CAB）的深度学习模型，有效解决了糖尿病视网膜病变（DR）分类中的数据不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变（DR）的自动分类对临床实践至关重要，但数据不平衡问题限制了深度学习模型的泛化能力。

Method: 采用基于注意力机制的深度学习模型，结合三种预训练网络（MobileNetV3-small、EfficientNet-b0和DenseNet-169）作为主干架构。

Result: 在APTOS和EYEPACS数据集上，模型表现优异，其中DenseNet-169在APTOS上达到83.20%的准确率。MobileNetV3-small参数较少，性能仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: 所提方法在DR分类中表现优异，与近期研究相比具有竞争力。

Abstract: Automatic classification of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) can assist
ophthalmologists in devising personalized treatment plans, making it a critical
component of clinical practice. However, imbalanced data distribution in the
dataset becomes a bottleneck in the generalization of deep learning models
trained for DR classification. In this work, we combine global attention block
(GAB) and category attention block (CAB) into the deep learning model, thus
effectively overcoming the imbalanced data distribution problem in DR
classification. Our proposed approach is based on an attention mechanism-based
deep learning model that employs three pre-trained networks, namely,
MobileNetV3-small, Efficientnet-b0, and DenseNet-169 as the backbone
architecture. We evaluate the proposed method on two publicly available
datasets of retinal fundoscopy images for DR. Experimental results show that on
the APTOS dataset, the DenseNet-169 yielded 83.20% mean accuracy, followed by
the MobileNetV3-small and EfficientNet-b0, which yielded 82% and 80%
accuracies, respectively. On the EYEPACS dataset, the EfficientNet-b0 yielded a
mean accuracy of 80%, while the DenseNet-169 and MobileNetV3-small yielded
75.43% and 76.68% accuracies, respectively. In addition, we also compute the
F1-score of 82.0%, precision of 82.1%, sensitivity of 83.0%, specificity of
95.5%, and a kappa score of 88.2% for the experiments. Moreover, in our work,
the MobileNetV3-small has 1.6 million parameters on the APTOS dataset and 0.90
million parameters on the EYEPACS dataset, which is comparatively less than
other methods. The proposed approach achieves competitive performance that is
at par with recently reported works on DR classification.

Motivation: 乳腺X光检查是乳腺癌筛查的主要手段，但深度学习模型的开发常受限于数据不足和病变特征多样性缺乏。现有生成模型未能充分关注病变特异性特征及其与周围组织的关系。

Method: GCDM基于潜在去噪扩散框架，结合软掩码嵌入和门控条件分支，动态选择和融合病变的放射组学和几何特性，确保解剖学一致性。

Conclusion: GCDM在乳腺X光图像合成中表现出色，有望成为临床应用的实用工具。

Abstract: Mammography is the most commonly used imaging modality for breast cancer
screening, driving an increasing demand for deep-learning techniques to support
large-scale analysis. However, the development of accurate and robust methods
is often limited by insufficient data availability and a lack of diversity in
lesion characteristics. While generative models offer a promising solution for
data synthesis, current approaches often fail to adequately emphasize
lesion-specific features and their relationships with surrounding tissues. In
this paper, we propose Gated Conditional Diffusion Model (GCDM), a novel
framework designed to jointly synthesize holistic mammogram images and
localized lesions. GCDM is built upon a latent denoising diffusion framework,
where the noised latent image is concatenated with a soft mask embedding that
represents breast, lesion, and their transitional regions, ensuring anatomical
coherence between them during the denoising process. To further emphasize
lesion-specific features, GCDM incorporates a gated conditioning branch that
guides the denoising process by dynamically selecting and fusing the most
relevant radiomic and geometric properties of lesions, effectively capturing
their interplay. Experimental results demonstrate that GCDM achieves precise
control over small lesion areas while enhancing the realism and diversity of
synthesized mammograms. These advancements position GCDM as a promising tool
for clinical applications in mammogram synthesis. Our code is available at

TL;DR: ULS23模型在纵向病灶分析中表现不佳，主要因扫描间配准错误导致分割质量下降和病灶对应关系崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ULS23模型在纵向病灶分割中的性能，揭示单时间点模型在时序数据分析中的局限性。

Method: 使用公共临床CT数据集评估ULS23模型的分割和跟踪能力，并通过人为位移实验验证模型对病灶中心假设的依赖性。

Result: 模型性能高度依赖病灶中心假设，位移后分割准确性显著下降。

Conclusion: 需开发专为时序分析设计的端到端模型，以提升纵向病灶跟踪的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Longitudinal lesion analysis is crucial for oncological care, yet automated
tools often struggle with temporal consistency. While universal lesion
segmentation models have advanced, they are typically designed for single time
points. This paper investigates the performance of the ULS23 segmentation model
in a longitudinal context. Using a public clinical dataset of baseline and
follow-up CT scans, we evaluated the model's ability to segment and track
lesions over time. We identified two critical, interconnected failure modes: a
sharp degradation in segmentation quality in follow-up cases due to inter-scan
registration errors, and a subsequent breakdown of the lesion correspondence
process. To systematically probe this vulnerability, we conducted a controlled
experiment where we artificially displaced the input volume relative to the
true lesion center. Our results demonstrate that the model's performance is
highly dependent on its assumption of a centered lesion; segmentation accuracy
collapses when the lesion is sufficiently displaced. These findings reveal a
fundamental limitation of applying single-timepoint models to longitudinal
data. We conclude that robust oncological tracking requires a paradigm shift
away from cascading single-purpose tools towards integrated, end-to-end models
inherently designed for temporal analysis.

TL;DR: NerT-CA提出了一种结合神经和张量表示的混合方法，用于加速稀疏视图X射线冠状动脉造影的4D重建，显著提升了训练速度和重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从X射线冠状动脉造影（CA）进行3D和动态4D重建可改善临床流程，但面临血管结构稀疏、背景与血管区分困难、稀疏视图和扫描内运动等挑战。现有方法依赖耗时的手动或易出错的自动分割，限制了临床实用性。

Method: NerT-CA结合神经和张量表示，将CA场景分解为低秩静态重建（使用快速张量场）和动态稀疏重建（使用神经场），显著加速训练。

Result: 该方法在训练时间和重建精度上均优于先前工作，仅需三个血管造影视图即可获得合理重建。

Conclusion: NerT-CA在4D幻影数据集上定量和定性验证了其有效性，为稀疏视图CA的4D重建提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) and dynamic 3D+time (4D) reconstruction of coronary
arteries from X-ray coronary angiography (CA) has the potential to improve
clinical procedures. However, there are multiple challenges to be addressed,
most notably, blood-vessel structure sparsity, poor background and blood vessel
distinction, sparse-views, and intra-scan motion. State-of-the-art
reconstruction approaches rely on time-consuming manual or error-prone
automatic segmentations, limiting clinical usability. Recently, approaches
based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown promise for automatic
reconstructions in the sparse-view setting. However, they suffer from long
training times due to their dependence on MLP-based representations. We propose
NerT-CA, a hybrid approach of Neural and Tensorial representations for
accelerated 4D reconstructions with sparse-view CA. Building on top of the
previous NeRF-based work, we model the CA scene as a decomposition of low-rank
and sparse components, utilizing fast tensorial fields for low-rank static
reconstruction and neural fields for dynamic sparse reconstruction. Our
approach outperforms previous works in both training time and reconstruction
accuracy, yielding reasonable reconstructions from as few as three angiogram
views. We validate our approach quantitatively and qualitatively on
representative 4D phantom datasets.

Motivation: 当前视频超分辨率（VSR）方法在时间动态建模、高频细节恢复和4K超分辨率评估方面存在不足，RealisVSR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: RealisVSR采用一致性保留的ControlNet架构（CPC）与Wan2.1视频扩散模型结合，提出高频修正扩散损失（HR-Loss），并构建了首个公开的4K VSR基准数据集RealisVideo-4K。

Result: 实验表明，RealisVSR在多个VSR基准测试中表现优异，尤其是在超高分辨率场景下，且仅需5-25%的训练数据量。

Conclusion: RealisVSR通过创新的架构和损失函数，显著提升了视频超分辨率的质量，特别是在高频细节和4K分辨率下的表现。

Abstract: Video Super-Resolution (VSR) has achieved significant progress through
diffusion models, effectively addressing the over-smoothing issues inherent in
GAN-based methods. Despite recent advances, three critical challenges persist
in VSR community: 1) Inconsistent modeling of temporal dynamics in foundational
models; 2) limited high-frequency detail recovery under complex real-world
degradations; and 3) insufficient evaluation of detail enhancement and 4K
super-resolution, as current methods primarily rely on 720P datasets with
inadequate details. To address these challenges, we propose RealisVSR, a
high-frequency detail-enhanced video diffusion model with three core
innovations: 1) Consistency Preserved ControlNet (CPC) architecture integrated
with the Wan2.1 video diffusion to model the smooth and complex motions and
suppress artifacts; 2) High-Frequency Rectified Diffusion Loss (HR-Loss)
combining wavelet decomposition and HOG feature constraints for texture
restoration; 3) RealisVideo-4K, the first public 4K VSR benchmark containing
1,000 high-definition video-text pairs. Leveraging the advanced spatio-temporal
guidance of Wan2.1, our method requires only 5-25% of the training data volume
compared to existing approaches. Extensive experiments on VSR benchmarks (REDS,
SPMCS, UDM10, YouTube-HQ, VideoLQ, RealisVideo-720P) demonstrate our
superiority, particularly in ultra-high-resolution scenarios.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in automated
Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) analysis. However, the efficacy of these
models is highly dependent on the availability of high-quality, artifact-free
images. In clinical practice, CMR acquisitions are frequently degraded by
respiratory motion, yet the robustness of deep learning models against such
artifacts remains an underexplored problem. To promote research in this domain,
we organized the MICCAI CMRxMotion challenge. We curated and publicly released
a dataset of 320 CMR cine series from 40 healthy volunteers who performed
specific breathing protocols to induce a controlled spectrum of motion
artifacts. The challenge comprised two tasks: 1) automated image quality
assessment to classify images based on motion severity, and 2) robust
myocardial segmentation in the presence of motion artifacts. A total of 22
algorithms were submitted and evaluated on the two designated tasks. This paper
presents a comprehensive overview of the challenge design and dataset, reports
the evaluation results for the top-performing methods, and further investigates
the impact of motion artifacts on five clinically relevant biomarkers. All

Motivation: 肿瘤分割在自适应放射治疗中至关重要，但现有方法（如SAM2）在准确性上存在不足。

Method: 引入两种策略：利用先验MR图像和注释作为上下文输入，以及通过随机边界框扩展和掩模腐蚀/膨胀增强提示鲁棒性。

Result: SAM2-Aug在多个数据集上表现优异，Dice分数分别为0.86（肝脏）、0.89（腹部）和0.90（脑部）。

Conclusion: 结合先验图像和增强提示多样性显著提升了分割性能，SAM2-Aug为肿瘤分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate tumor segmentation is vital for adaptive radiation therapy
(ART) but remains time-consuming and user-dependent. Segment Anything Model 2
(SAM2) shows promise for prompt-based segmentation but struggles with tumor
accuracy. We propose prior knowledge-based augmentation strategies to enhance
SAM2 for ART.
  Methods: Two strategies were introduced to improve SAM2: (1) using prior MR
images and annotations as contextual inputs, and (2) improving prompt
robustness via random bounding box expansion and mask erosion/dilation. The
resulting model, SAM2-Aug, was fine-tuned and tested on the One-Seq-Liver
dataset (115 MRIs from 31 liver cancer patients), and evaluated without
retraining on Mix-Seq-Abdomen (88 MRIs, 28 patients) and Mix-Seq-Brain (86
MRIs, 37 patients).
  Results: SAM2-Aug outperformed convolutional, transformer-based, and
prompt-driven models across all datasets, achieving Dice scores of 0.86(liver),
0.89(abdomen), and 0.90(brain). It demonstrated strong generalization across
tumor types and imaging sequences, with improved performance in
boundary-sensitive metrics.
  Conclusions: Incorporating prior images and enhancing prompt diversity
significantly boosts segmentation accuracy and generalizability. SAM2-Aug
offers a robust, efficient solution for tumor segmentation in ART. Code and
models will be released at https://github.com/apple1986/SAM2-Aug.

TL;DR: TiVy算法通过动态时间规整（DTW）和频繁序列模式提取，解决了多时间序列可视化中的可扩展性和清晰性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列可视化方法在长跨度或多序列时易产生视觉混乱，难以有效比较和识别趋势。

Method: TiVy将时间序列转换为基于DTW的符号序列，并通过频繁序列模式构建不重叠的相似子序列分组。

Result: 实验表明，TiVy能清晰提取模式，速度提升1000倍，并支持实时交互式可视化。

Conclusion: TiVy为大规模时间序列数据提供了高效、清晰的视觉摘要方法。

Abstract: Visualizing multiple time series presents fundamental tradeoffs between
scalability and visual clarity. Time series capture the behavior of many
large-scale real-world processes, from stock market trends to urban activities.
Users often gain insights by visualizing them as line charts, juxtaposing or
superposing multiple time series to compare them and identify trends and
patterns. However, existing representations struggle with scalability: when
covering long time spans, leading to visual clutter from too many small
multiples or overlapping lines. We propose TiVy, a new algorithm that
summarizes time series using sequential patterns. It transforms the series into
a set of symbolic sequences based on subsequence visual similarity using
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), then constructs a disjoint grouping of similar
subsequences based on the frequent sequential patterns. The grouping result, a
visual summary of time series, provides uncluttered superposition with fewer
small multiples. Unlike common clustering techniques, TiVy extracts similar
subsequences (of varying lengths) aligned in time. We also present an
interactive time series visualization that renders large-scale time series in
real-time. Our experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm (1) extracts
clear and accurate patterns when visualizing time series data, (2) achieves a
significant speed-up (1000X) compared to a straightforward DTW clustering. We
also demonstrate the efficiency of our approach to explore hidden structures in
massive time series data in two usage scenarios.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为“梯度丢弃”的方法，通过修改反向传播过程来增强前馈神经网络对输入噪声的鲁棒性，并结合目标变量噪声扰动，实验表明该方法在特定条件下显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前馈神经网络（FFNNs）对输入噪声敏感，现有正则化方法（如丢弃法）常改变网络结构或忽略神经元交互。本研究旨在通过改进反向传播和探索目标变量噪声扰动来提升FFNN的噪声鲁棒性。

Method: 将反向传播解释为多智能体博弈，提出“梯度丢弃”方法，在反向传播时以概率1-p选择性屏蔽隐藏层神经元梯度，同时保持前向传播活跃。此外，对目标变量施加白噪声或稳定分布扰动。

Result: 在十个多样化表格数据集上的实验显示，方法的有效性取决于数据集和超参数。在回归任务中，梯度丢弃（p=0.9）结合稳定分布噪声显著提升了输入噪声鲁棒性，表现为更平坦的MSE曲线和更稳定的SMAPE值。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了提升神经网络鲁棒性的潜力，强调了自适应参数调优的重要性，并为在博弈论框架下分析神经网络的复杂适应性行为开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) are vulnerable to input noise, reducing
prediction performance. Existing regularization methods like dropout often
alter network architecture or overlook neuron interactions. This study aims to
enhance FFNN noise robustness by modifying backpropagation, interpreted as a
multi-agent game, and exploring controlled target variable noising. Our
"gradient dropout" selectively nullifies hidden layer neuron gradients with
probability 1 - p during backpropagation, while keeping forward passes active.
This is framed within compositional game theory. Additionally, target variables
were perturbed with white noise or stable distributions. Experiments on ten
diverse tabular datasets show varying impacts: improvement or diminishing of
robustness and accuracy, depending on dataset and hyperparameters. Notably, on
regression tasks, gradient dropout (p = 0.9) combined with stable distribution
target noising significantly increased input noise robustness, evidenced by
flatter MSE curves and more stable SMAPE values. These results highlight the
method's potential, underscore the critical role of adaptive parameter tuning,
and open new avenues for analyzing neural networks as complex adaptive systems
exhibiting emergent behavior within a game-theoretic framework.

Abstract: Neural-network quantum states (NQS) are powerful neural-network ans\"atzes
that have emerged as promising tools for studying quantum many-body physics
through the lens of the variational principle. These architectures are known to
be systematically improvable by increasing the number of parameters. Here we
demonstrate an Adaptive scheme to optimize NQSs, through the example of
recurrent neural networks (RNN), using a fraction of the computation cost while
reducing training fluctuations and improving the quality of variational
calculations targeting ground states of prototypical models in one- and
two-spatial dimensions. This Adaptive technique reduces the computational cost
through training small RNNs and reusing them to initialize larger RNNs. This
work opens up the possibility for optimizing graphical processing unit (GPU)
resources deployed in large-scale NQS simulations.

Abstract: The Mumford-Shah (MS) model is an important technique for mesh segmentation.
Many existing researches focus on piecewise constant MS mesh segmentation model
with total variation regularization, which pursue the shortest length of
boundaries. Different from previous efforts, in this article, we propose a
novel piecewise smooth MS mesh segmentation model by utilizing the relaxed
total generalized variation regularization (rTGV). The new model assumes that
the feature function of a mesh can be approximated by the sum of piecewise
constant function and asmooth function, and the rTGV regularization is able to
characterize the high order discontinuity of the geometric structure. The newly
introduced method is effective in segmenting meshes with irregular structures
and getting the better boundaries rather than the shortest boundaries. We solve
the new model by alternating minimization and alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM). Our algorithm is discussed from several aspects, and
comparisons with several state-of-art methods. Experimental results show that
our method can yield competitive results when compared to other approaches. In
addition, our results compare favorably to those of the several state-of-art
techniques when evaluated on the Princeton Segmentation Benchmark. Furthermore,
the quantitative errors and computational costs confirm the robustness and
efficiency of the proposed method.

### [262] [Multi-Year Maintenance Planning for Large-Scale Infrastructure Systems: A Novel Network Deep Q-Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18732)
*Amir Fard,Arnold X. -X. Yuan*

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度强化学习（DRL）的框架，用于优化大规模基础设施网络的资产管理策略，显著提升了计算效率和网络性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统资产管理方法在大规模网络中面临计算复杂性和预算约束的挑战，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 通过将网络级马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）分解为资产级MDP，并采用统一的神经网络架构，降低计算复杂度并提升学习效率。

Conclusion: 该框架为基础设施资产管理及强化学习在复杂大规模环境中的应用提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: Infrastructure asset management is essential for sustaining the performance
of public infrastructure such as road networks, bridges, and utility networks.
Traditional maintenance and rehabilitation planning methods often face
scalability and computational challenges, particularly for large-scale networks
with thousands of assets under budget constraints. This paper presents a novel
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that optimizes asset management
strategies for large infrastructure networks. By decomposing the network-level
Markov Decision Process (MDP) into individual asset-level MDPs while using a
unified neural network architecture, the proposed framework reduces
computational complexity, improves learning efficiency, and enhances
scalability. The framework directly incorporates annual budget constraints
through a budget allocation mechanism, ensuring maintenance plans are both
optimal and cost-effective. Through a case study on a large-scale pavement
network of 68,800 segments, the proposed DRL framework demonstrates significant
improvements over traditional methods like Progressive Linear Programming and
genetic algorithms, both in efficiency and network performance. This
advancement contributes to infrastructure asset management and the broader
application of reinforcement learning in complex, large-scale environments.

*Zhe Zhang,Suvrit Sra*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对未知分段的平滑（PWS）函数的高效优化算法，首次实现了全局线性收敛，并扩展了方法以处理近似PWS函数和弱凸问题。同时，引入了首个可验证的终止准则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对未知分段的平滑函数优化问题，现有方法缺乏全局收敛性和有效的终止准则，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一种基于束水平（BL）的方法，适用于满足二次增长（QG）条件的PWS函数，并扩展至近似PWS和弱凸问题。此外，开发了一种可验证的终止准则及其搜索子程序。

Result: 首次实现了全局线性收敛，并将复杂度提升至与非凸平滑优化基准匹配。终止准则在QG条件下紧密表征最优性差距，且无需问题参数。

Conclusion: 本文提出的算法和终止准则为PWS优化问题提供了高效且几乎无需参数的解决方案，显著推进了该领域的研究。

Abstract: We develop efficient algorithms for optimizing piecewise smooth (PWS)
functions where the underlying partition of the domain into smooth pieces is
\emph{unknown}. For PWS functions satisfying a quadratic growth (QG) condition,
we propose a bundle-level (BL) type method that achieves global linear
convergence -- to our knowledge, the first such result for any algorithm for
this problem class. We extend this method to handle approximately PWS functions
and to solve weakly-convex PWS problems, improving the state-of-the-art
complexity to match the benchmark for smooth non-convex optimization.
Furthermore, we introduce the first verifiable and accurate termination
criterion for PWS optimization. Similar to the gradient norm in smooth
optimization, this certificate tightly characterizes the optimality gap under
the QG condition, and can moreover be evaluated without knowledge of any
problem parameters. We develop a search subroutine for this certificate and
embed it within a guess-and-check framework, resulting in an almost
parameter-free algorithm for both the convex QG and weakly-convex settings.

Conclusion: 提出的三平面特征设计和等变性方法在抓取任务中表现出高效性和优越性能。

Abstract: We propose a new volumetric grasp model that is equivariant to rotations
around the vertical axis, leading to a significant improvement in sample
efficiency. Our model employs a tri-plane volumetric feature representation --
i.e., the projection of 3D features onto three canonical planes. We introduce a
novel tri-plane feature design in which features on the horizontal plane are
equivariant to 90{\deg} rotations, while the sum of features from the other two
planes remains invariant to the same transformations. This design is enabled by
a new deformable steerable convolution, which combines the adaptability of
deformable convolutions with the rotational equivariance of steerable ones.
This allows the receptive field to adapt to local object geometry while
preserving equivariance properties. We further develop equivariant adaptations
of two state-of-the-art volumetric grasp planners, GIGA and IGD. Specifically,
we derive a new equivariant formulation of IGD's deformable attention mechanism
and propose an equivariant generative model of grasp orientations based on flow
matching. We provide a detailed analytical justification of the proposed
equivariance properties and validate our approach through extensive simulated
and real-world experiments. Our results demonstrate that the proposed
projection-based design significantly reduces both computational and memory
costs. Moreover, the equivariant grasp models built on top of our tri-plane
features consistently outperform their non-equivariant counterparts, achieving
higher performance with only a modest computational overhead. Video and code

Motivation: 现有大型语言模型虽能支持开放域对话，但缺乏处理多模态社交交互的能力，限制了社交机器人的表现。

Method: 提出利用视觉语言模型处理广泛的视觉信息，并探讨了如何将其适配到社交机器人中，以及剩余的技术挑战。

Result: 视觉语言模型有望为社交机器人提供更全面的多模态交互能力。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型是提升社交机器人多模态交互能力的有前景方向，但仍需解决技术挑战和评估问题。

Abstract: Large language models have given social robots the ability to autonomously
engage in open-domain conversations. However, they are still missing a
fundamental social skill: making use of the multiple modalities that carry
social interactions. While previous work has focused on task-oriented
interactions that require referencing the environment or specific phenomena in
social interactions such as dialogue breakdowns, we outline the overall needs
of a multimodal system for social conversations with robots. We then argue that
vision-language models are able to process this wide range of visual
information in a sufficiently general manner for autonomous social robots. We
describe how to adapt them to this setting, which technical challenges remain,
and briefly discuss evaluation practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多智能体环境中，手工设计的约束可能无法满足复杂协调需求，需要一种既能保持控制器可靠性又能适应动态变化的方法。

Method: 提出ReCoDe框架，通过局部通信学习动态约束，改进专家控制器，实现更有效的协调。

Result: 实验表明ReCoDe优于纯手工控制器、其他混合方法及标准多智能体强化学习基线。

Conclusion: 保留用户定义的控制器并动态调整其依赖程度，比从零学习更高效。

Abstract: Constraint-based optimization is a cornerstone of robotics, enabling the
design of controllers that reliably encode task and safety requirements such as
collision avoidance or formation adherence. However, handcrafted constraints
can fail in multi-agent settings that demand complex coordination. We introduce
ReCoDe--Reinforcement-based Constraint Design--a decentralized, hybrid
framework that merges the reliability of optimization-based controllers with
the adaptability of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Rather than discarding
expert controllers, ReCoDe improves them by learning additional, dynamic
constraints that capture subtler behaviors, for example, by constraining agent
movements to prevent congestion in cluttered scenarios. Through local
communication, agents collectively constrain their allowed actions to
coordinate more effectively under changing conditions. In this work, we focus
on applications of ReCoDe to multi-agent navigation tasks requiring intricate,
context-based movements and consensus, where we show that it outperforms purely
handcrafted controllers, other hybrid approaches, and standard MARL baselines.
We give empirical (real robot) and theoretical evidence that retaining a
user-defined controller, even when it is imperfect, is more efficient than
learning from scratch, especially because ReCoDe can dynamically change the
degree to which it relies on this controller.

Result: 实验表明，Perpetua在模拟和真实数据中比类似方法更准确，且能在线适应和应对缺失观测。

Conclusion: Perpetua是一种高效、可扩展且通用的方法，适用于动态环境中的特征状态预测。

Abstract: Many robotic systems require extended deployments in complex, dynamic
environments. In such deployments, parts of the environment may change between
subsequent robot observations. Most robotic mapping or environment modeling
algorithms are incapable of representing dynamic features in a way that enables
predicting their future state. Instead, they opt to filter certain state
observations, either by removing them or some form of weighted averaging. This
paper introduces Perpetua, a method for modeling the dynamics of semi-static
features. Perpetua is able to: incorporate prior knowledge about the dynamics
of the feature if it exists, track multiple hypotheses, and adapt over time to
enable predicting of future feature states. Specifically, we chain together
mixtures of "persistence" and "emergence" filters to model the probability that
features will disappear or reappear in a formal Bayesian framework. The
approach is an efficient, scalable, general, and robust method for estimating
the states of features in an environment, both in the present as well as at
arbitrary future times. Through experiments on simulated and real-world data,
we find that Perpetua yields better accuracy than similar approaches while also
being online adaptable and robust to missing observations.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the problem of learning a structured approximation (low-rank,
sparse, banded, etc.) to an unknown matrix $A$ given access to matrix-vector
product (matvec) queries of the form $x \rightarrow Ax$ and $x \rightarrow
A^Tx$. This problem is of central importance to algorithms across scientific
computing and machine learning, with applications to fast multiplication and
inversion for structured matrices, building preconditioners for first-order
optimization, and as a model for differential operator learning. Prior work
focuses on obtaining query complexity upper and lower bounds for learning
specific structured matrix families that commonly arise in applications.
  We initiate the study of the problem in greater generality, aiming to
understand the query complexity of learning approximations from general matrix
families. Our main result focuses on finding a near-optimal approximation to
$A$ from any finite-sized family of matrices, $\mathcal{F}$. Standard results
from matrix sketching show that $O(\log|\mathcal{F}|)$ matvec queries suffice
in this setting. This bound can also be achieved, and is optimal, for
vector-matrix-vector queries of the form $x,y\rightarrow x^TAy$, which have
been widely studied in work on rank-$1$ matrix sensing.
  Surprisingly, we show that, in the matvec model, it is possible to obtain a
nearly quadratic improvement in complexity, to
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\log|\mathcal{F}|})$. Further, we prove that this bound is
tight up to log-log factors.Via covering number arguments, our result extends
to well-studied infinite families. As an example, we establish that a
near-optimal approximation from any \emph{linear matrix family} of dimension
$q$ can be learned with $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{q})$ matvec queries, improving on an
$O(q)$ bound achievable via sketching techniques and vector-matrix-vector
queries.

Conclusion: 框架为可持续且公平的能源社区提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Fair and dynamic energy allocation in community microgrids remains a critical
challenge, particularly when serving socio-economically diverse participants.
Static optimization and cost-sharing methods often fail to adapt to evolving
inequities, leading to participant dissatisfaction and unsustainable
cooperation. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates
multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), cooperative game
theory, and a dynamic equity-adjustment mechanism driven by reinforcement
learning (RL). At its core, the framework utilizes a bi-level optimization
model grounded in Equity-regarding Welfare Maximization (EqWM) principles,
which incorporate Rawlsian fairness to prioritize the welfare of the least
advantaged participants. We introduce a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
agent that dynamically adjusts socio-economic weights in the optimization
objective based on observed inequities in cost and renewable energy access.
This RL-powered feedback loop enables the system to learn and adapt,
continuously striving for a more equitable state. To ensure transparency,
Explainable AI (XAI) is used to interpret the benefit allocations derived from
a weighted Shapley value. Validated across six realistic scenarios, the
framework demonstrates peak demand reductions of up to 72.6%, and significant
cooperative gains. The adaptive RL mechanism further reduces the Gini
coefficient over time, showcasing a pathway to truly sustainable and fair
energy communities.

Motivation: 解决现有神经伴随方法在OMT逆设计中的可扩展性和多样性不足问题。

Conclusion: ENA框架在OMT逆设计中表现出高效、多样、可解释和灵活的特点。

Abstract: We propose an extended neural adjoint (ENA) framework, which meets six key
criteria for artificial intelligence-assisted inverse design of optical
multilayer thin films (OMTs): accuracy, efficiency, diversity, scalability,
flexibility, and interpretability. To enhance the scalability of the existing
neural adjoint method, we present a novel forward neural network architecture
for OMTs and introduce a material loss function into the existing neural
adjoint loss function, facilitating the exploration of material configurations
of OMTs. Furthermore, we present the detailed formulation of the regression
activation mapping for the presented forward neural network architecture
(F-RAM), a feature visualization method aimed at improving interpretability. We
validated the efficacy of the material loss by conducting an ablation study,
where each component of the loss function is systematically removed and
evaluated. The results indicated that the inclusion of the material loss
significantly improves accuracy and diversity. To substantiate the performance
of the ENA-based inverse design, we compared it against the residual
network-based global optimization network (Res-GLOnet). The ENA yielded the OMT
solutions of an inverse design with higher accuracy and better diversity
compared to the Res-GLOnet. To demonstrate the interpretability, we applied
F-RAM to diverse OMT structures with similar optical properties, obtained by
the proposed ENA method. We showed that distributions of feature importance for
various OMT structures exhibiting analogous optical properties are consistent,
despite variations in material configurations, layer number, and thicknesses.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the flexibility of the ENA method by restricting
the initial layer of OMTs to SiO2 and 100 nm.
